The Preventive Medicine Grand Rounds on November 3, 2021, was hosted by the CDC's Division of Scientific Education and Professional Development, sponsored by various institutions including the CDC Preventive Medicine Residency and Fellowship, and the Health Resources and Services Administration Bureau of Health Workforce. The event was conducted via Zoom, and attendees could ask questions during the lecture. Continuing education credits were available for attendees.

The speaker, Captain Karen Heard, a member of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, discussed the importance of understanding the history, laws, and current public health infrastructure impacting American Indian and Alaskan Native (AIAN) populations. Her presentation aimed to increase awareness about AIAN populations, identify historical laws affecting them, understand their uniqueness, identify partners contributing to AIAN public health, learn about the tribal health infrastructure, and about CDC's work with AIAN communities.

Captain Heard detailed the role of her office, the Office of Tribal Affairs and Strategic Alliances (OTASA), in connecting CDC with tribal governments and organizations to improve public health outcomes. She highlighted the diversity among the 574 federally recognized tribes in the U.S., each with their own history, culture, and governance, and emphasized the concept of tribal sovereignty.

She reviewed critical historical federal Indian laws, including the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which led to the forced relocation of numerous tribes, the Indian Appropriations Act creating reservations, the Dawes Act of 1887 which aimed to assimilate American Indians into American society and resulted in the loss of tribal lands, and the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, which allowed tribes to establish limited governments and manage resources.

Captain Heard also discussed social determinants of health unique to AIAN populations, including intergenerational trauma, access to healthcare, and housing challenges, with a focus on historical trauma and its impact on health disparities. The presentation also touched on the creation of a task force to address the crisis of missing and murdered AIAN women and girls.

She emphasized the resilience and cultural wealth of AIAN communities, and the importance of culturally specific prevention strategies. One such strategy is the Traditional Practices for Wellness in Indian Country (TIPWIC), a cooperative agreement promoting tribal practices for resilience and wellness.

Various partners in AIAN public health infrastructure were discussed, including urban Indian organizations, Indian health boards, tribal epidemiology centers, and the National Indian Health Board (NIHB). She explained the differences between Title I and Title V for tribal administration of programs, and the role of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and Indian Health Service (IHS).

In conclusion, Captain Heard's presentation provided a comprehensive overview of AIAN public health, discussing historical context, current challenges, and collaborative efforts to improve health outcomes for AIAN communities. She acknowledged the complexity of tribal public health and the need for flexible and culturally sensitive approaches.
The meeting focused on the federal work conducted with American Indian Alaska Native tribal nations and urban populations, involving two federal departments: the Department of the Interior and the Department of Health and Human Services. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) within the Department of Interior carries out its mission through the Office of Indian Services, which covers general assistance, disaster relief, Indian child welfare, and tribal reservation roads programs.

The presenter, a licensed clinical social worker, began by detailing their experience in a small clinic and their connection to the Office of Indian Services. They discussed the Office of Justice Services, which operates or funds law enforcement and justice on federal Indian lands. The Office of Trust Services manages trust resources for American Indian and Alaska Natives, while the Office of Field Operations oversees regional offices to carry out the Bureau's mission.

The Department of Health and Human Services encompasses various agencies, including the Indian Health Service, which provides federal health care services, and the Substance Use Mental Health Services Administration, which aims to overcome barriers to high-quality programs for those at risk of addictive and mental health disorders.

The meeting then shifted to discuss the National Tribal Behavioral Health Agenda, a blueprint for aligning resources and strengthening policies to address behavioral health issues. It is not a strategic plan but a guiding tool to engage partners and unify actions.

Concerning funding, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides grants and supports capacity building in Indian Country. Funding is specific to tribal nations but should also account for cultural practices.

The Tribal Epidemiology Center Public Health Infrastructure (Tech Fee) is a CDC initiative to reduce programmatic gaps by building capacity through a network coordinating center. The Tribal Practices for Wellness in Indian Country (TIPWIC) encourages tribal practices that build resiliency and reduce risk factors, focusing on health promotion, cultural practices, and social and emotional wellbeing.

The Good Health and Wellness in Indian Country program aims to support culturally appropriate public health initiatives, with long-term goals to reduce chronic diseases and risk factors. The Capacity Building and Quality Improvement Umbrella Cooperative Grant (OT18-1803) helps tribal nations improve public health systems, and a map illustrates the 25 recipients of this grant.

Projects under OT18-1803 focus on public health workforce expansion, data collection, and improvement of community health. There is also substantial funding directed to combat COVID-19 and build public health capacity in response to the pandemic.

The CDC's Tribal Advisory Committee advises on policy issues affecting American Indian and Alaska Native communities and assists the CDC in its mission. The CDC and ATSDR's Tribal Consultation Policy requires consultation with tribal governments on policies and activities that affect these communities.

Lastly, the meeting addressed the importance of distinguishing between consultation and listening sessions, with consultation being necessary for activities with significant tribal impact and listening sessions being used for informal guidance on activities with lower implications.

Key takeaways include the need for direct and continuous funding sources, resources for capacity building, data access, and quality of data to efficiently allocate resources to the American Indian Alaska Native populations.
The meeting transcript outlines a discussion on public health issues related to American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) communities, emphasizing the importance of considering cultural practices and community knowledge when designing and implementing health initiatives. Participants stress the need for ongoing communication and collaboration with tribal nations and partners, avoiding assumptions, and asking questions to ensure effective public health strategies.

A personal story is shared to illustrate the pitfalls of making assumptions, recounting a project on pediatric obesity in a tribal nation where researchers initially misunderstood the cultural value placed on children's weight due to a historical trauma. This underscores the necessity of engaging with community elders and incorporating cultural knowledge into interventions.

The presentation also informs about the Office of Tribal Affairs and Strategic Alliances (OTASA) and resources available at cdc.gov/tribal, including CDC's tribal consultation policy and resources for working with AIAN populations. The speaker offers their email for further contact and encourages participation in upcoming Tribal Advisory Committee (TAC) meetings.

The transcript mentions the role of TAC in providing input on public health issues affecting AIAN communities and highlights various programs and cooperative agreements aimed at improving public health infrastructure, services, and capacity building in AIAN communities. These include initiatives for data modernization, law enforcement support, addressing historical trauma, and enhancing public health services.

The discussion touches on the complexities of jurisdictional issues between tribal, federal, and state entities, and how this impacts public health services, funding, and data collection. The importance of recognizing tribal sovereignty and providing culturally tailored services is highlighted, alongside the need for improving public health workforce in AIAN communities.

The transcript also notes the challenges and progress in developing public health infrastructure for tribal nations, the impact of historical policies like the Indian Removal Act, and the need to respect AIAN cultures and practices. It concludes with a call for further engagement, learning, and support to address the unique public health needs of AIAN populations.
