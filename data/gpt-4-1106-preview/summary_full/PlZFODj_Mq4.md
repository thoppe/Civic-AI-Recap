The meeting was a webinar focused on well-being learning in communities, with multiple co-sponsors including the Department of Commerce and various organizations and universities. The agenda included hearing from the National League of Cities about city innovation, a discussion led by Shannon Arvizu from the Department of Commerce, insights from federal voices, and a concluding audience Q&A.

Amanda Janauve from the Well-Being Economy Alliance discussed shifting the definition of progress from GDP to ecological and social well-being. Elizabeth from New America highlighted the need for spaces to share implementation strategies for well-being.

Sue from the National League of Cities discussed the Cities of Opportunity initiative, which engages city leaders in addressing health through policy and systems change. She emphasized the importance of starting where cities are, considering the variety of factors that impact health, and shared the example of Tacoma's equity index.

Lourdes Aceves provided details on how Tacoma created and utilized an equity index to inform community engagement and address disparities. The index was used to prioritize investments and distribute loans and grants fairly, focusing on historically under-invested areas.

The webinar then shifted to Green Bay, Wisconsin, where Joe Faulds, Chief of Operations for the City of Green Bay, and Natalie Baumstad, Executive Director of Wello, discussed their unique public-private partnership focused on advancing health and well-being. They explained Wello's role in co-creating equitable community conditions and the evolution from a physical health focus to a broader well-being approach. They highlighted the importance of a backbone organization, local subjective data on well-being, and community-led projects.

Key components of their model include starting small, focusing on inclusivity, co-creation, community engagement, system thinking, storytelling, and recognizing October 3rd as the official day of health and well-being in the region.
The meeting transcript outlines the work of Wello, a community organization focused on fostering well-being and systemic change. Wello employs a community-driven approach to address large-scale issues by breaking them down into manageable parts. They emphasize starting small, securing win-win situations, and using local data to drive policy and systems change. The approach is three-pronged, involving surveys, panel studies, and ground truthing to ensure diverse perspectives and accurate data. Wello collaborates with local government and has built strong relationships with city leadership and private entities. They have successfully influenced decision-making and policy, such as declaring racism a public health crisis. Key to their success are long-term relationships, local data relevance, and a focus on equity and justice.

Challenges mentioned include navigating funding mechanisms and data collection complexities. The transcript also references the importance of academic research partnerships and community engagement in research processes. The organization has seen its well-being framework adopted in various sectors, influencing health assessments, and policies for minority groups.

The speakers suggest that federal support could be improved by considering the unique needs of mid-sized communities and providing more localized data. They also highlight the importance of not letting the pursuit of perfection impede progress and the need for ongoing learning and adaptation. The transcript concludes with an acknowledgment of the importance of keeping the community informed, interested, and inspired.

Overall, the summary points to Wello's effective model of incremental, collaborative, data-driven community improvement that prioritizes well-being, equity, and systemic change.

11. The inefficiency of cities having to create separate data sharing agreements was noted, with a call for federal technical assistance and standardized processes.
12. The significance of research and evaluation capabilities at the city level and the potential role of federal funding in this domain were discussed.
13. Attendees confirmed the value of county-level data for decision-making and policy development, advocating for additional analysis to distinguish between smaller units like zip codes, census tracts, and counties.

Overall, the meeting highlighted the collaborative efforts needed across community organizations, local, state, and federal governments to promote well-being and resilience, while recognizing the need for improved funding mechanisms, data sharing, and evaluation practices.
The meeting discusses strategies for advancing well-being from a municipal and county perspective, emphasizing the importance of data, collaboration, and community involvement. Participants highlight the need for county-level data and resources to support municipalities within the county, stressing that collaboration among the League of Cities and the National Association of Counties is crucial. They mention that counties often have better resources and suggest the need for intentional relationship building between cities and counties to spur collaboration.

Joe and Natalie offer advice to those seeking to emulate their work. Joe emphasizes the importance of starting with small wins to build momentum, while Natalie stresses that well-being is about people and the importance of engaging community organizers and neighborhood associations as early adopters of well-being frameworks.

Elizabeth thanks the speakers and summarizes key themes: the importance of understanding economies, people, places, and the planet, and leveraging flexible multi-year funding to foster partnerships and avoid letting perfection hinder progress. Amanda discusses the importance of trust and broad-based support for well-being initiatives, and the potential role of the federal government in building a movement for well-being.

The conversation also touches on the use of well-being indicators and frameworks, the importance of local decision-making, and the role of the federal government in providing direction and resources. There is a call to consider not just physical health but broader aspects of well-being, and the challenges and opportunities for local governments in using data and engaging in policy change are explored.

The transcript reveals a strong emphasis on the role of local governments in driving well-being initiatives, the need for collaboration across levels of government, and the potential for federal support to enhance these efforts. It also highlights the importance of starting small, focusing on people, and creating opportunities for community engagement and partnership.
