WEBVTT

00:00.910 --> 00:09.174
I want to announce before the board continues that the board in closed session discussed and or took action on the following cases.

00:10.035 --> 00:19.740
LAT versus the state and CSBA San Jose versus SBE CDE Promise Academy Charter School.

00:21.261 --> 00:22.402
I have an announcement.

00:22.802 --> 00:25.063
There is a change on our agenda today.

00:26.064 --> 00:28.125
Item 20 for executive prep.

00:29.076 --> 00:35.018
hearing has been withdrawn by the petitioner on July 11th, 2018.

00:36.279 --> 00:53.405
Therefore, the board under the action of the petitioner will not consider item 20 and we will move on then to item 21, the renewal petition for the establishment of a charter school under the oversight of the SBE.

00:54.265 --> 00:57.807
So, we're now ready for Lisa to present

00:58.618 --> 01:03.961
the background of this and then we will have a public hearing with 10 minutes for each side.

01:04.661 --> 01:12.205
And then we will have a public, we will have public comment and of course board discussion.

01:13.126 --> 01:13.506
Go ahead.

01:27.408 --> 01:29.570
I think you need to adjust that.

01:29.870 --> 01:30.330
Thank you.

01:32.171 --> 01:32.592
Thank you.

01:33.352 --> 01:36.834
The first item up today is item 21 for guidance charter school.

01:37.695 --> 01:40.697
And it is before the state board today as a renewal.

01:41.217 --> 01:44.919
So I wanted to go over a little bit of the education code on the renewal requirements.

01:44.979 --> 01:46.000
I thought I'd start there.

01:46.680 --> 01:49.002
And then we can go into the presentation a little bit.

01:49.022 --> 01:51.363
I do have some handouts that I passed out also.

01:51.403 --> 01:54.565
And I'll talk a little bit about those as we get to the end of the presentation.

01:55.986 --> 02:07.912
But in terms of the review for renewal petitions, the Education Code 1747605B and 47607B set forth ground rules for denying a renewal petition.

02:10.333 --> 02:22.018
And under there are four criteria, three of those pertain to the API, but the fourth criteria states that the entity that granted the charter determines that the academic performance of the charter school

02:22.598 --> 02:41.188
is at least equal to the academic performance of the public schools that the charter school pupils would otherwise have been required to attend, as well as the academic performance of the schools in the school district in which the charter school is located, taking into account the composition of the pupil population that is served at the charter school.

02:42.408 --> 02:59.518
And then pursuant to SB 1290, it also states, the district shall consider increases in pupil academic achievement for all groups of pupils served by the charter school as the most important factor in determining whether to grant a charter renewal.

03:00.856 --> 03:17.066
The education code then further goes on to state that in addition state regulations require the district to consider the past performance of the school's academics, finances and operation in evaluating the likelihood of future success along with future plans for improvement if any.

03:17.527 --> 03:21.009
So I just wanted to go over the ed code quickly before I went into the presentation.

03:24.153 --> 03:26.895
So a little bit about the timeline for this school.

03:28.356 --> 03:37.881
On October 29th, 2017, the Palmdale School District voted to deny the renewal petition of Guidance High School by a vote of three to one and one abstention.

03:39.362 --> 03:44.105
March 20th, 2018, the Los Angeles County Board of Education took no action.

03:45.026 --> 03:49.108
The guidance petitioners then submitted a petition on appeal to the state board on April 2nd, 2018.

03:52.540 --> 04:05.952
The CDE recommendation is the state board hold a public hearing to deny the request to establish Guidance High School, I'm sorry that's a typo, it is a K-12 charter school under the oversight of the state board.

04:06.433 --> 04:09.495
The recommendation is based on an unsound educational program.

04:09.595 --> 04:19.084
The school does not perform overall at least equal to its resident schools and the school does not demonstrate increases in pupil achievements for all groups of pupils served.

04:22.369 --> 04:26.150
We have also determined that there are some deficiencies in the charter petition as well.

04:26.691 --> 04:39.716
The description of educational program including what was lacking in the petition is a plan for English learners, a plan for special education, identifications for identifying pupil outcomes and pupil progress,

04:40.576 --> 04:46.979
There's missing information about who the independent auditor would be, governance structure, and then also school closure procedures.

04:47.039 --> 04:56.222
So this is just a list of items in the petition that we've identified would need some clarification and would need to be clarified prior to the opening of the school.

04:59.056 --> 05:07.811
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools met on June 12, 2018, and the Advisory Commission moved to recommend approval of the petition to the State Board.

05:08.372 --> 05:10.736
The motion was passed by a vote of five to three.

05:13.038 --> 05:14.880
A little bit of background on the school.

05:15.180 --> 05:19.704
The school has been open since 2001, so it has been in operation for a while.

05:20.465 --> 05:24.028
They are currently serving 901 pupils in grades K through 12.

05:24.888 --> 05:26.089
There is a K-5.

05:27.431 --> 05:30.573
Part of the school is at a private facility located in Palmdale.

05:30.593 --> 05:31.995
That's the K-5 portion.

05:32.615 --> 05:36.819
The 6-12 is currently located at a facility through Palmdale School District.

05:37.419 --> 05:44.286
and they are proposing to actually move the 6 to 12 grades into a new private facility that is currently being built and is under construction.

05:45.167 --> 05:48.690
The school plans to grow to 1,400 pupils by 2021 and up to 2,390 by the end of the charter term.

05:56.218 --> 06:03.844
I have included this chart here to kind of just give an overall of their CASP results from 2014-17.

06:04.064 --> 06:08.468
You do have a copy of the presentation in case this is too small to look at.

06:09.469 --> 06:17.055
But at the very top in red is Guidance Charter School and then below are a list of the comparable schools in the district.

06:17.575 --> 06:24.241
Now, this is an elementary school district, so several of these schools are not actually K-12.

06:24.282 --> 06:37.814
The only one that is K-12 is the Palmdale Aerospace Academy, so that is the third one downlisted so that you can see the comparables there in comparison to what the guidance school actually is, as well as the K-12.

06:39.156 --> 06:52.014
Now overall, for the ELA, the scores have pretty much become evened out over the years, but overall, the school scores are some of the poorest in the district overall.

06:55.350 --> 07:15.343
As part of the district's oversight and in their findings, they have stated that while ELA overall academic performance in grades 3 through 8 was at least equal to school students that students would otherwise attend, the grade 11 performance in ELA was not equal, nor was math performance in grades 3 to 8 or 11 equal.

07:19.225 --> 07:28.749
The district also found that teachers, there was teachers without valid credentials including English language, English learner authorization and two certified teachers that were misassigned.

07:29.590 --> 07:38.194
They also found that all courses do not have A through G transferability and that there have been incorrect reporting of students who have completed A through G requirements.

07:38.314 --> 07:40.915
This was part of the district findings through their oversight.

07:43.993 --> 07:50.158
Now in terms of their fiscal situation, they do have a multi-year financial plan that is fiscally viable.

07:50.819 --> 07:57.044
They have projected positive ending funding balances of over $10 million in one year, $13 million, and then $16 million.

07:57.104 --> 07:57.765
And their reserves are over 100%.

08:01.688 --> 08:07.276
They do have large expenditures there and they do have costs for this new facility that they are building.

08:07.336 --> 08:16.448
The facility itself is going to cost about $40 million and then part of their budget also includes a monthly rent in this facility that's about over $180,000 a month.

08:21.374 --> 08:28.597
In the district's oversight, they found in their fiscal audit that they were concerned about these related party transactions.

08:29.057 --> 08:36.099
The executive director of the school serves as an advisor to both the lender and borrower in loans and overseas transfer of monies.

08:36.799 --> 08:41.901
They have questions about the conflicts of interest of the facility lease agreements with the American Islamic Institute.

08:42.061 --> 08:46.443
The executive director of the school is also the founder of the American Islamic Institute.

08:47.303 --> 09:00.488
They found budget inconsistencies, incorrect reporting of rent paid, high facility costs, and also this rental house that the school owns and rents out as well as kind of part of their overall budget.

09:03.662 --> 09:10.666
And in part of LACO's review, they have actually found some potential lawsuits and pending lawsuits against the school at this time.

09:11.267 --> 09:16.009
Three former principals have pending discrimination lawsuits against the school's executive director.

09:16.890 --> 09:31.939
And some of those allegations include failure to accommodate employee disabilities, requiring male-female staff to sit separately at staff meetings, directing principals to discipline employees who spoke Spanish at work but allowed others to speak Arabic,

09:32.859 --> 09:42.515
telling a female principal that his country in his country they would beat her or for requesting equal treatment with male staff and refusing to allow special education students to take Arabic.

09:42.975 --> 09:44.778
And this came out of the county findings.

09:44.959 --> 09:47.062
So just pulling that directly from there.

09:48.928 --> 09:58.297
In terms of the discrepancies in the charter elements, as I mentioned earlier, we did find that they did lack a plan for English learners, a plan for special education students.

10:00.459 --> 10:11.689
The petition does not present a reasonably comprehensive description of measurable pupil outcomes and did not outline a plan for collecting, analyzing, and reporting the data on pupil achievement.

10:13.737 --> 10:17.181
Further, we did not see anyone specified who would be the independent auditor.

10:17.201 --> 10:25.369
In terms of governance, they didn't include evidence that there will be active and effective representation of the interested parties, including parents.

10:25.949 --> 10:28.432
And we didn't see any evidence of the school closure procedure.

10:28.512 --> 10:35.199
So just wanted to give you just a overall picture of some of the discrepancies we saw in the charter petition.

10:37.463 --> 10:53.071
In summary, CDE staff is recommending denial, mainly for the decreases in academic performance, which leads to their unsound educational program, concerned about the pending lawsuits, and then, as mentioned before, the elements in the petition that are lacking.

10:54.592 --> 11:01.434
I also handed out for each of the board members the table two that we use to show the demographics.

11:01.494 --> 11:07.935
So that's that blue paper that you all have in case there was any questions about that.

11:08.115 --> 11:13.176
Again, the equivalent school that's a K-12 also is the Palmdale Aerospace Academy.

11:13.876 --> 11:17.177
So that is the second one listed on the demographic chart.

11:17.357 --> 11:19.857
And we included this with the ACCS item.

11:20.037 --> 11:22.298
So I just wanted to print that out for everyone to have.

11:23.098 --> 11:31.889
And then behind that is the fall dashboard results, in case there was any questions about that as well, just an overall view of the equity report.

11:32.189 --> 11:41.341
And then attached to that is just the status reports associated with ELA and then mathematics as well, just so you could have some background in that.

11:43.601 --> 11:45.002
That concludes my presentation.

11:45.042 --> 11:47.044
If anyone has any questions at this time.

11:47.084 --> 11:48.645
These are for the audience.

11:48.665 --> 11:53.448
These are more technical questions for CDE at this point about their presentation.

11:54.489 --> 11:56.270
Board members have any questions?

11:57.591 --> 11:58.252
Okay, no.

11:59.692 --> 12:03.013
All right, so we'll now open the public hearing.

12:03.513 --> 12:16.236
Each side will have 10 minutes to present the case and so I will take first the petitioners for us to approve the charter school.

12:16.496 --> 12:18.257
You have 10 minutes, please come up.

12:19.817 --> 12:20.077
Thank you.

12:30.112 --> 12:31.459
Okay, I think we have it.

12:31.801 --> 12:32.123
Yes.

12:43.209 --> 12:44.850
I only see the school district one.

12:44.870 --> 12:47.051
Do I have to see the school district one?

12:47.071 --> 12:48.552
Can I load his?

12:49.072 --> 12:49.352
Yeah.

12:49.512 --> 12:49.732
OK.

12:49.872 --> 12:50.353
I'll load his.

12:50.553 --> 12:50.613
OK.

12:50.633 --> 12:53.534
Let me go ahead and load yours.

12:55.495 --> 12:56.055
Oh, you do?

12:56.316 --> 12:56.756
OK.

12:57.176 --> 12:58.557
Or it's the purple flash drive.

12:58.637 --> 12:59.057
OK.

12:59.157 --> 12:59.417
Sorry.

12:59.957 --> 13:02.258
I pulled yours out so I could put mine in.

13:06.561 --> 13:06.681
OK.

13:09.202 --> 13:09.542
Top one?

13:14.031 --> 13:16.293
Okay, there we are.

13:16.313 --> 13:31.604
Our 12th grade valedictorian award goes to

13:44.203 --> 13:45.019
Okay, there you go.

13:56.479 --> 13:58.220
Good morning, Mr. President, members of the board.

13:58.240 --> 13:59.281
My name is Kamal Al-Khatib.

13:59.361 --> 14:02.522
I am the founder and the executive director of the Guidance Charter School.

14:03.002 --> 14:12.628
The school has been in business for 17 years, and we have enjoyed a very good relationship with our sponsoring district until the time we submitted our renewal last year.

14:13.428 --> 14:16.630
Out of the sudden, we've become different, and the relationship has changed.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.986
because a new board took over a few years ago.

14:20.407 --> 14:25.791
The school serves 94% of free and reduced lunch student.

14:26.391 --> 14:40.823
We have 46% are categorized as disadvantaged student, social disadvantaged according to the free and reduced lunch, and we have 84% social advantaged student based on the CASP testing.

14:40.843 --> 14:42.164
We have 72% Hispanic, 17% African American,

14:48.443 --> 14:50.824
Okay, I hope I get some time back on this.

14:50.844 --> 14:53.145
And we have also 21.6% ELL student and 17% special education.

15:06.417 --> 15:20.811
I can tell you the founding that we have from the district, they have no merits and we will prove to you today that these information, they have not actually been brought to us on 17 years.

15:21.331 --> 15:27.598
They never brought any of these issues except last year when they had an issue with the school.

15:28.138 --> 15:29.299
as a result of a complaint.

15:29.619 --> 15:31.981
Our attorney will go over some of the stuff.

15:32.121 --> 15:33.421
There is no conflict of interest.

15:33.481 --> 15:36.824
There is no problem with our budget.

15:36.964 --> 15:41.466
We are very solid, and our financial CFO will tell you that we are very solid.

15:41.526 --> 15:43.167
We have a very good education program.

15:43.888 --> 15:51.713
I have a video that I would like to play right now to the audience just to give you an idea about what the school has been doing for the community.

15:51.733 --> 15:53.094
It impacted a lot of lives.

15:54.014 --> 16:01.983
And also, I passed to you the yearbook for the students in the two campuses, just to show you, to give you an idea what kind of activity we have.

16:02.483 --> 16:04.365
We're not here for show-off.

16:04.886 --> 16:05.467
We are real.

16:05.567 --> 16:07.829
We are a school that really, a community school.

16:08.290 --> 16:10.292
So I'd like to play the video, if you don't mind.

16:14.316 --> 16:14.897
Which one is that?

16:29.528 --> 16:37.274
Our 12th grade valedictorian award goes to Tamara Perry.

16:37.974 --> 16:48.462
Hi, I'm Cameron G. One of the reasons why I like the GCS is because they're always explaining what they teach me and they always help me no matter what.

16:59.280 --> 17:16.692
Hi guys, my name is Amir and I want to share all of you guys what I like about the school and it's the coaches because they help us to get up and they help us remind ourselves to get out of the bathroom because of playing.

17:17.552 --> 17:21.835
Hi guys, my name is Sharif and I'm going to show you about Dr. Briggs.

17:22.216 --> 17:26.919
Dr. Briggs is the best principal of all and he's going to

17:27.506 --> 17:29.949
and he teaches us how to be smart.

17:33.593 --> 17:36.316
This is a new campus that we are being almost finished.

17:36.336 --> 17:37.438
We're going to be August.

17:37.618 --> 17:38.279
We're going to open it.

17:43.865 --> 17:46.268
The cost of this $35 million, just to let you know.

17:53.817 --> 17:57.798
Okay, I'd like to call our attorney to go over some of the findings.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.780
Good morning, Board President Kirsten, board members.

18:07.820 --> 18:08.760
My name is Janelle Rooley.

18:08.780 --> 18:14.602
I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Young, Mini, and Core here with the petitioners urging your support of this charter renewal.

18:16.587 --> 18:24.061
One thing that Mr. Al-Khatib didn't mention is that Guidance just got their letter from WASC notifying them about accreditation through 2020.

18:24.863 --> 18:27.748
So that's another good thing that's going for Guidance.

18:28.797 --> 18:32.941
Throughout this particular charter renewal, two themes I think were consistently present.

18:33.302 --> 18:38.387
First, lack of due process from the district, and then second, the competing interests of the district.

18:39.247 --> 18:44.152
First on due process, Guidance Charter School has been operating and authorized by the district since 2001.

18:44.353 --> 18:45.674
That's 17 years of history.

18:48.376 --> 18:57.603
17 years of serving hundreds of students every year, 17 years of employing local community members, 17 years of clean audits, enrollment growth, and facilities development.

18:58.123 --> 19:00.985
In short, guidance is a bedrock in this Palmdale community.

19:02.126 --> 19:06.429
And yet we're not before you with a paper trail of notices of concern or cure.

19:06.809 --> 19:10.712
The district has not produced oversight reports documenting mistakes or misdeeds.

19:12.780 --> 19:24.411
We are before you, therefore, because guidance was lulled into a false sense of security by the district, by the written representations, and then ultimately sucker-punched when it came to non-renewal.

19:25.131 --> 19:27.213
And the charter petition itself actually reflects that.

19:27.654 --> 19:31.817
This is a much more clipped version of a charter than you've seen in modern charters.

19:32.598 --> 19:39.142
Functionally, the district's actions are tantamount to revocation, but guidance actually got none of the process that is accorded to revocations.

19:39.182 --> 19:42.984
There's no notice of violations, no cure period, no extensive hearings.

19:43.364 --> 19:45.406
In fact, I was there for the meeting at Palmdale.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.907
There was no discussion on this item before they voted.

19:48.247 --> 19:51.229
There was a presentation and then the vote was called for.

19:51.269 --> 19:52.090
There was no discussion.

19:52.970 --> 20:01.576
In December of 2016, approximately a year before the renewal vote, the district did express concerns about teacher credentials and about an allegation of a conflict of interest.

20:01.977 --> 20:09.242
Two months later, February 7th of 2017, the district wrote a letter to Guidance stating that its investigation uncovered no conflicts.

20:09.702 --> 20:10.683
That was February 7th.

20:11.844 --> 20:18.569
One week after that, February 15th, the district wrote another letter stating that Guidance was in good standing when it came to renewal.

20:19.309 --> 20:22.592
This letter was, in fact, relied on in the issuance of a $30 million bond.

20:23.272 --> 20:28.717
The LA County Board found these facts determinative of the matter, voting 3 to 1 in favor of renewal.

20:29.198 --> 20:35.343
Unfortunately, though, county rules require four votes, four affirmative votes, and there were only four people there that day.

20:36.772 --> 20:43.119
So on the district's interest, you know, guidance does enroll about 900 students, the majority of whom would otherwise attend a Palmdale school.

20:43.679 --> 20:54.751
The perverse disincentives of the Charter Schools Act were made plain last month when the district proudly told the ACCS that it got a federal grant to convert its middle schools into magnets.

20:54.831 --> 20:58.134
And I think the ellipsis there is that they want to be able to fill those seats.

20:59.082 --> 21:06.727
So desperate to understand what was going on with his non-renewal, Guidance filed the Public Records Act, which the district systematically evaded.

21:07.207 --> 21:13.071
Guidance went to court to ensure the district's transparency, and Palmdale ended up paying about $42,000 in fees.

21:13.852 --> 21:17.374
We're asking you to put the pieces together, and I know time is short, so I want to turn this over.

21:19.315 --> 21:19.695
Thank you.

21:20.896 --> 21:22.897
Good morning, board president, board members.

21:23.457 --> 21:24.738
My name is Dr. Byron Briggs.

21:24.878 --> 21:26.779
I'm the principal at the K-5 campus.

21:27.259 --> 21:33.682
And Mr. Al-Khatib has gone over some of my information, but that's great because time is running short.

21:35.023 --> 21:35.824
But we do survey

21:36.864 --> 21:38.446
very diverse community.

21:38.706 --> 21:43.450
Our student population does a great job at our school.

21:44.070 --> 21:51.437
One of the things I wanted to look at is the upward trend of our enrollment, because as we put the pieces together, we can see where our enrollment was in 2012,

21:53.738 --> 21:58.922
13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

21:57.861 --> 21:58.922
And that becomes an issue.

21:59.522 --> 22:00.643
That is one of the issues.

22:01.423 --> 22:05.126
The next thing that I want to look at is the schools in which we're being compared to.

22:05.946 --> 22:10.669
At the commission's meeting, they asked us to compare apples to apples and oranges to oranges.

22:10.949 --> 22:11.890
And that's what we started to do.

22:12.450 --> 22:16.532
to look at the data and compare apples to apples, oranges to oranges.

22:17.093 --> 22:22.736
We may mention of the Aerospace Academy, that's a 6 to 12 campus, not a K through 12, 6 through 12.

22:24.096 --> 22:29.759
So we started looking at the data and it's a STEM academy and with NASA.

22:30.500 --> 22:40.605
And out of the 25 schools in the district, we're not the best, but we rank ninth out of the 25 schools in the district when you put us in that population.

22:41.326 --> 22:41.486
So

22:43.004 --> 22:44.985
Here's another chart that looks at it in a different way.

22:45.246 --> 22:46.306
We are the green bar.

22:47.407 --> 22:52.470
And as you see, the longer the students are with us, their score starts to increase.

22:52.490 --> 22:54.832
That's one of the things that our teachers are doing.

22:54.852 --> 22:59.515
We have effective teachers, and we have an effective school that is turning students' lives around.

22:59.936 --> 23:02.938
We're touching students in a positive way.

23:03.538 --> 23:07.080
When you look at our ELA comparison to the district, we are the green.

23:08.381 --> 23:09.282
The state is the gray.

23:11.192 --> 23:12.294
And look at our scores.

23:12.534 --> 23:17.961
We are the only school with two years of positive increases in the district.

23:18.562 --> 23:20.144
And this is looking at the high schools.

23:24.109 --> 23:26.572
When we look at our math scores, we did start low.

23:27.793 --> 23:28.513
we did start low.

23:28.833 --> 23:33.254
But again, we are the only school in the district with two years of positive increases.

23:33.695 --> 23:35.135
Our students are making a difference.

23:35.335 --> 23:40.016
Our school is making a difference, not only to the students, but to the community.

23:40.056 --> 23:42.517
We are a positive impact on the community as well.

23:42.977 --> 23:47.878
When we look at our social disadvantaged students, again, positive increases both years.

23:47.978 --> 23:51.740
And we are the only school in the district with a positive increase.

23:54.300 --> 23:56.941
When we look at our African-American students who struggled throughout the country,

23:58.186 --> 24:01.947
Again, our students have a positive increase two years in a row.

24:02.287 --> 24:04.568
So we are impacting those students where it counts.

24:04.628 --> 24:04.928
Time.

24:06.128 --> 24:06.449
Thank you.

24:07.549 --> 24:10.850
We're going to get one more minute because of the confusion.

24:10.910 --> 24:11.570
So go ahead.

24:12.050 --> 24:24.314
When we look at our ELA comparison, the percentage of students that are meeting or exceeding, and these are middle schools and they are magnet middle schools in which we're being compared to.

24:26.135 --> 24:27.115
STEM middle schools.

24:28.459 --> 24:28.999
We're second.

24:30.581 --> 24:32.622
We are really making a difference.

24:33.043 --> 24:39.708
The difference that we're making, again, is not only just with the students themselves, but it's with future generations.

24:39.988 --> 24:44.332
Because we're giving our students the opportunity that the Palmdale School District does not give them.

24:44.772 --> 24:47.554
And that's why we have so many students that are coming to us.

24:47.714 --> 24:49.476
And our enrollment is continuing to increase.

24:50.036 --> 24:51.477
Because parents are disgruntled.

24:51.958 --> 24:57.482
And they need a place to go, a safe place to go, where their kids can learn and be comfortable.

25:00.253 --> 25:00.793
Thank you all.

25:01.594 --> 25:03.615
I just wanted to use my 14 seconds.

25:04.476 --> 25:10.939
The guidance charter school, when we had the API system, scored 792 points.

25:11.880 --> 25:18.424
And our African-American subgroup scored 824, one of the highest in the whole entire Antelope Valley.

25:18.784 --> 25:21.005
The new system, we are gradually improving.

25:21.686 --> 25:22.826
And believe me, we're going to be there.

25:23.086 --> 25:26.549
We're going to be one of the best schools in the state of California.

25:27.109 --> 25:27.829
Thank you for your time.

25:27.849 --> 25:28.970
We're available for any questions.

25:29.485 --> 25:35.412
All right, now we'll give the opponents to the petition 10 minutes.

26:18.339 --> 26:18.920
Good morning.

26:19.681 --> 26:21.883
I'm Stacy Bryant, the deputy superintendent.

26:22.604 --> 26:24.706
We aren't here to oppose charter schools.

26:25.207 --> 26:27.990
We have two successful charters in our district.

26:28.992 --> 26:30.593
GCS is not one of them.

26:31.374 --> 26:35.699
Our job is to protect the public trust and student interest through our accountability.

26:36.660 --> 26:48.985
As the CDE staff clearly recognizes, there are a number of specific standards specified in the law that agencies must consider when determining whether to grant or deny a charter renewal petition.

26:49.725 --> 27:00.750
As reflected in staff's report, guidance renewal petition has failed to satisfy a significant number of the legally prescribed standards and there are substantive concerns in multiple areas.

27:01.610 --> 27:02.471
Two reminders.

27:02.931 --> 27:07.233
First, this is the first renewal for Guidance's high school.

27:08.014 --> 27:11.415
It's logical time to review critically their program.

27:12.116 --> 27:22.421
Second, yes, this is the 17th year for Guidance Charter without the typical restraints of Ed Code and having the freedom to create something challenging and exciting.

27:23.382 --> 27:28.545
We should see significant academic growth outperforming our own schools.

27:29.806 --> 27:41.060
We believe the CDE staff reached the correct conclusion when recommending that the board deny the petition and encourage all members of the Board of Education to support staff's recommendation.

27:46.149 --> 27:49.710
I am Frances, the CBO from Palmdale School District.

27:50.311 --> 27:55.192
The guidance charter petition contains financial inconsistencies and fiscal concerns.

27:56.213 --> 28:04.135
As was stated right now, the free and reduced lunch that was shown was 94% on the slide, but in the petition it says 80.2%.

28:06.236 --> 28:15.980
And I attached this form in the last page of the packet from the district this morning, but in the CalPATS, we have 84% free and reduced loan for guidance charter school.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.421
They've never been up to 94%.

28:17.821 --> 28:30.526
The petition presented an unrealistic financial and operation plan with very high budget projection that is dependent on the projected enrollment and ADA, which may not much realize.

28:31.346 --> 28:38.533
Guidance Charter School, as NYP, shows very high increase in expenditure in 2018-19, about 43.7%.

28:40.074 --> 28:48.582
Compared to 2017-18, and as options, they show unrealistic increases in unduplicated student percentages.

28:49.323 --> 28:53.047
Guidance Charter School facilities leases will increase from $164,000 annually

28:55.889 --> 29:00.972
to 2.3 million annually in 2018-19 school year.

29:01.892 --> 29:05.754
This is 15 times more than the 2017-18 that the charter.

29:06.195 --> 29:16.220
We think that the charter will not be able to support that if ADA did not materialize since they have never met their projected enrollment in ADA since the last three years.

29:16.960 --> 29:21.143
There is a lack of internal control from internal review of supporting documents.

29:21.263 --> 29:25.786
Also, the school rented out the house without clear details as to the purpose.

29:26.927 --> 29:39.696
For the governance and conflict of interest, Palmdale School District feels very strongly about it, which is very similar to the way the State Board of Education feels, and we are concerned about their violations.

29:40.536 --> 29:48.582
Finally, the charter school historically has huge ending fund balance that always exceeds 100% of annual expenditure cost.

29:49.583 --> 29:57.909
Our concerns are, one, they are not spending their funds on students and the educational program based on the data that we reviewed this morning.

29:58.450 --> 30:00.811
Two, they have the lowest paid teachers.

30:00.971 --> 30:04.134
And three, the elementary school facilities is atrocious.

30:06.325 --> 30:09.406
Funds should be spent on the students that generate the ADA.

30:09.707 --> 30:14.849
Charter policies are based on public trust, and students' interest is the key.

30:16.009 --> 30:28.775
The question we are asking is, will guidance charter be able to meet the financial obligation in the multi-year projection if the enrollment and ADA did not materialize as projected in the budget?

30:28.855 --> 30:30.056
And the answer is no.

30:33.962 --> 30:34.302
Good morning.

30:34.322 --> 30:35.283
My name is Dr. Torres.

30:35.323 --> 30:37.964
I'm the Director of Human Resources for the Palmdale School District.

30:38.184 --> 30:49.650
And, you know, the following slide shows a timeline of oversight visits that we've conducted over the past five years, which reflect a pattern of guidance having non-credentialed teachers.

30:50.390 --> 30:54.733
The district has made a good faith effort in assisting guidance with their credentialing issues.

30:55.233 --> 31:02.997
However, they continue to ignore our request and had their legal counsel send Palmdale a letter indicating that

31:03.397 --> 31:05.658
their teachers are not required to be credentialed.

31:06.539 --> 31:17.665
Over the past two years, there has been a pattern of lack of transparency with guidance as well as deceptive practices that are prevalent and raise extreme concerns.

31:18.365 --> 31:23.208
During the ACC hearing, they testified that all their teachers were credentialed,

31:24.048 --> 31:27.910
Within a week of that ACC hearing, we went back and reviewed.

31:27.950 --> 31:38.835
They had seven teachers that are currently not credentialed, as well as several subs teaching these so-called A through G required classes.

31:40.464 --> 32:00.844
In addition, we have had guidance employees contact my office regarding guidance's failure to pay them correctly, as well as refusing to provide the employees with their legally entitled maternity leave under the federal and state law, which have extreme legal implications.

32:03.902 --> 32:07.284
Good morning, I'm Elena Esquer, I'm the Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services.

32:07.884 --> 32:19.729
In discussing academic achievement, which you have heard a lot from the CDE this morning, unfortunately the progress is not what we would hope for given the small classes and the student opportunities advertised and all the things that you heard from the school today.

32:19.789 --> 32:26.512
It's been 17 years, their achievement does not show that, and their educational program is of great concern, especially in the area of mathematics.

32:27.252 --> 32:31.995
The data we are presenting this morning was taken from DataQuest and not manipulated in any way.

32:32.955 --> 32:43.000
I would like to call your attention to the fact that Guidance Charter's mathematics scores are very low and have failed to show increases school-wide, including student cohort data in many of the grade levels.

32:43.681 --> 32:47.883
Most of our schools are higher, and you would have seen the same trend in the previous two years.

32:48.563 --> 32:57.648
We are all striving for continuous improvement, but an excessive reserve not spent on students and supplemental materials and support cannot possibly help gain the achievement necessary.

32:58.408 --> 33:05.456
Here's the 11th grade comparison in math to the schools the students would have otherwise attended in the Antelope Valley Union High School District.

33:05.996 --> 33:08.479
Guidance charter as well scored well below.

33:09.039 --> 33:11.022
The zero is really quite alarming.

33:11.882 --> 33:19.811
Although the petition and even their LCAP mentions hiring high quality teachers, misassigned teachers or lack of proper credentialing has a connection to such low scores.

33:21.380 --> 33:25.642
Here is the 11th grade ELA comparison to the schools the students would have otherwise attended.

33:26.243 --> 33:29.785
Guidance charter scored well below the other two schools and the district as a whole.

33:30.605 --> 33:33.787
Examining the high school program during our visits was indicative of these results.

33:34.227 --> 33:49.796
We saw little evidence of pathway programs as they advertised, few students not really working on specialized skills, students simply delivering on memorized material in such classes as biology and the EMT preparation class without engaging in thought process or critical thinking as the new standards indicate.

33:50.536 --> 33:53.238
Students we spoke with indicated this was common class practice.

33:54.980 --> 34:00.084
English learners have also failed to show an increase in CAS scores and the reclassification rates show slow growth.

34:00.844 --> 34:07.450
At the elementary site, English learner curriculum does not exist and students do not participate in designated or integrated ELD.

34:08.090 --> 34:12.714
Neither campus indicated time on the master schedule or ELD was taught to students requiring instruction.

34:13.354 --> 34:18.776
The petition also does not describe how teachers will deliver ELD instruction or integrate ELD into the core.

34:19.236 --> 34:21.917
No interventions or strategies are listed for working with ELs.

34:22.498 --> 34:27.680
There is no evidence that differentiation is occurring, nor that the reclassified students will be monitored throughout the year.

34:28.200 --> 34:33.182
The current reclassification rates are low, currently under 10%, well below ours and the high school district's average.

34:34.864 --> 34:45.650
We have serious concerns with their vague measurable outcomes for the reasons listed on this slide, but especially with their lack of understanding of RTI, which was mentioned on their WASC report, differentiation and non-alignment to current state standards.

34:45.670 --> 34:48.031
The petition does not include the current California standards.

34:48.691 --> 34:51.273
We also have concerns for their outcomes of special ed students.

34:51.993 --> 35:03.039
We included in your packet letters from our SPED staff who detail the lack of responsiveness from guidance charter staff, including administration, as well as the lack of materials and equipment and working conditions for the staff.

35:03.700 --> 35:06.664
IEP accommodations are often not followed, making outcomes questionable.

35:07.686 --> 35:13.555
The last thing is A through G, which only had 20% of their students meeting those requirements.

35:15.583 --> 35:17.884
I know we're rushing everyone because we'll run out of time.

35:17.984 --> 35:21.025
So good morning, President Kirsten, members of the board.

35:21.105 --> 35:29.308
I'm Dina Wilson, and I'm proud to be here today with my team from the county representing the Los Angeles County superintendent and staff.

35:30.448 --> 35:37.151
As you know, the county conducts a thorough and de novo review when we receive a any charter petition on appeal.

35:38.831 --> 35:42.913
We based our when we did our review, we found similar to

35:44.133 --> 35:56.464
The district, and that's the handout that you have before you, has our staff findings on the front page in which we found they do not meet the minimum requirements for academic requirements for renewal.

35:57.421 --> 35:58.821
The program is unsound.

35:59.562 --> 36:14.326
The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement as well as there being a lack of reasonably comprehensive description of all required elements, nine of which were determined to be not reasonably comprehensive and six with deficiencies.

36:15.746 --> 36:22.468
As it sounds redundant, but as we know, the most important factor to determine whether or not we renew a charter is their academics.

36:23.048 --> 36:31.831
What the county has done, because it is a spanned school, in the handout that we can give you, is we've disaggregated the data by level.

36:32.251 --> 36:39.813
And you can see with the exception of English language arts at the middle school, guidance charter school falls below the median for all grade spans.

36:40.573 --> 36:43.414
And especially atrocious is the 11th grade performance.

36:43.474 --> 36:43.774
Thank you.

36:45.359 --> 36:46.520
Yeah, I want to assure L.A.

36:46.560 --> 36:51.565
County that we may call on you again, and I have some questions for you, too, so.

36:53.608 --> 36:59.133
OK, well, I think now we should proceed to the public comment with the assent of the board.

36:59.353 --> 37:00.134
All right.

37:01.416 --> 37:07.522
All public comments have one minute, and so we will now have people line up in order of sign up.

37:08.715 --> 37:10.996
With the following people, please line up.

37:11.116 --> 37:29.962
Raul Maldonado, Nancy Smith, Bonifacio Garcia, Nick Hagan, Joseph Dunn, Suresh Bahna, Marisol Orriso, Jimmy Areta, Ben Areta, Dan Lee, Abdul

37:30.566 --> 37:44.812
Amarera, Aman Murshil, Angela Torres, Greta Small, Aishelle Portillo, Beatriz Ramirez, Adriana Ramirez, and Eric Premack.

37:49.226 --> 37:50.407
Please identify yourself.

37:51.088 --> 37:51.488
Thank you.

37:52.068 --> 37:52.529
Good morning.

37:52.589 --> 37:55.011
Raul Maldonado, superintendent of the Palmdale School District.

37:55.612 --> 37:57.293
I'm here to support my staff.

37:57.373 --> 38:00.296
We have done a great job in monitoring the guidance charter school.

38:00.656 --> 38:06.241
But I want to let you know as an English learner, a student myself growing up in the city of Paramount,

38:06.741 --> 38:14.783
I had a mom that was very involved because the school, the public school, gave me a great opportunity to learn and to learn English.

38:15.183 --> 38:20.685
And so I worry about the students at Guidance Charter that do not have an ELD period.

38:21.385 --> 38:24.326
Not only that, their parents are not allowed to be involved.

38:25.306 --> 38:29.833
If we don't allow the parents to be involved, how can the parents really find out if this is a great school?

38:30.314 --> 38:38.345
Pond Hill School District has a fantastic program, but I do worry about the students that are at this school because if they're not getting an equal education.

38:38.806 --> 38:39.807
We talk about the 17 years.

38:41.469 --> 38:55.881
You saw a graph in which the guidance charter school is comparing themselves to some of our middle schools Let's compare the charter school to our choice schools, which are those Camino's dual immersion program Los amigos and palm the learning Plaza.

38:55.901 --> 38:55.921
I

39:01.274 --> 39:01.694
Good morning.

39:02.415 --> 39:03.215
I'm Nancy Smith.

39:03.295 --> 39:06.357
I'm the president of the Palmdale School Board and retired superintendent.

39:07.258 --> 39:12.381
I want to let you know first off we know charter schools are here to stay and we have two successful charter schools.

39:13.022 --> 39:16.144
This one is not a successful charter school in our opinion.

39:17.224 --> 39:22.908
Guidance charter was not renewed by the district because of the many deficiencies found.

39:23.428 --> 39:25.330
These deficiencies have to do with students.

39:25.430 --> 39:28.652
That is our priority is what are they doing with students.

39:29.753 --> 39:32.456
Our staff has tried to work and communicate with guidance.

39:32.756 --> 39:38.903
They've either been ignored or we've been given inaccurate materials as we found when we went in and did our monitoring.

39:39.784 --> 39:47.533
We've been told we need to monitor and do it carefully because they now have this debt that we would be responsible for if we did not monitor.

39:48.273 --> 39:51.216
We have another charter school that has the debt also, and we had no problem.

39:51.256 --> 39:53.018
We renewed those two in the last year.

39:53.698 --> 39:55.160
They were both renewed for five years.

39:55.240 --> 39:58.383
So we want you to understand we are here to talk about kids.

39:58.523 --> 40:00.685
We know we're not gonna be the authorizing agency.

40:00.745 --> 40:03.527
We know we'll be out of it, but we're here to fight for kids.

40:03.867 --> 40:04.148
Thank you.

40:09.434 --> 40:10.975
Good morning, my name is Bonnie Garcia.

40:11.055 --> 40:15.916
I am General Counsel for the Palmdale School District, and I'm here, obviously, to support the district.

40:16.337 --> 40:18.057
A couple of points to be made very quickly.

40:18.377 --> 40:24.060
One, you've heard reference to a letter that the district wrote in February of 2017 saying that they were in good standing.

40:24.160 --> 40:35.564
I will point out that the district was referring to they're currently in good standing, meaning that we didn't have any efforts at that point in time to go into revocation, in which case the burden would be on us.

40:37.245 --> 40:41.247
In addition, we also informed them that they had some issues with respect to their credentialing.

40:41.767 --> 40:45.769
We did say that they were being in a cooperative process and they'd given us a plan.

40:45.789 --> 40:46.329
Well, guess what?

40:46.569 --> 40:52.352
After that, the plan didn't come through and the people were not, in fact, receiving their credentials.

40:52.853 --> 40:59.116
Finally, very quickly, the final offering of memorandum issued by the charter school

40:59.876 --> 41:12.010
gives investors notice of the problem of the credentials, and also that an authorizing school could revoke the charter if they didn't meet the performance goals, especially with respect to students.

41:12.070 --> 41:14.393
So they're on notice.

41:20.114 --> 41:22.355
Good morning, Board President Kurst and state board members.

41:22.775 --> 41:24.215
I'm Nick Hagen from Piper Jaffray.

41:25.015 --> 41:29.957
In early 2017, Piper Jaffray underwrote a $30 million financing for Guidance Charter School.

41:30.337 --> 41:33.798
As part of that underwriting, we spent a meaningful amount of time reviewing the status of the charter.

41:34.298 --> 41:43.661
We and investors for the bonds relied heavily on representations of Palmdale School District, and in particular, on two letters written by the district to the Guidance Charter School.

41:44.501 --> 41:47.704
to track the remedy of the issues that were previously identified.

41:48.144 --> 41:57.391
The first letter stated that after investigation, the district found no evidence of improper dealings or conflicts of interest with guidance's board or officers.

41:57.892 --> 42:02.335
The second stated that the charter school is in good standing other than with respect to teacher credentialing.

42:03.016 --> 42:07.740
The district letter confirmed that guidance has taken all necessary steps to remedy the credentialing issues.

42:08.300 --> 42:12.785
Based on these representations, investors were willing to provide $30 million of capital for new facilities.

42:13.365 --> 42:24.837
A non-renewal of a 17-year charter so soon after these types of representations were made does not seem possible or right, will likely have negative effect on other local charter schools trying to access the capital markets.

42:25.457 --> 42:25.738
Thank you.

42:30.626 --> 42:32.707
Good morning, Board President Kirsten, state board members.

42:32.827 --> 42:33.787
My name is Joseph Dunn.

42:34.487 --> 42:39.149
I represent Wilmington Trust, the bond trustee on the bonds issued just last year.

42:39.169 --> 42:49.232
The trustee and the bondholders are deeply troubled that mere months after the district represented to the bondholder that the school had a clean bill of health,

42:50.112 --> 43:12.442
It voted not to renew a charter it had previously renewed Multiple times based on factors that were never brought to the attention of the school or other stakeholders a non-renewal under these circumstances With a school that has served the community for 17 years Is going to have an effect in the capital markets charter schools often rely on bond financing to meet the needs of building and

43:13.231 --> 43:25.375
and acquiring facilities, but investors like the school and its stakeholders rely on the existence of an open and fair process, excuse me, to evaluate any risk to the school's charter.

43:25.855 --> 43:30.877
And the circumstances here will shake the confidence of investors in future projects.

43:31.677 --> 43:38.719
Members of the LACOE board recognize the risk of that precedent, and they took no action after three of four members voted to renew.

43:39.340 --> 43:39.620
Thank you.

43:48.223 --> 43:51.466
Good morning, my name is Suresh Vajna, principal of the 612 campus.

43:52.547 --> 44:09.141
An in-depth review of the CDE data from the dashboard shows that the GCS is consistent with or exceeding some of the levels of comparable districts in the region or vicinity, their performance, including Palmdale School District academic performance,

44:10.021 --> 44:11.062
at code 47607.

44:12.122 --> 44:13.663
For example, the suspension rate.

44:14.263 --> 44:24.887
There's a decline in three of the six student groups compared to two of the 13 student groups in PSD and five of the 13 in Antelope Valley Union High School District.

44:25.928 --> 44:26.048
And

44:28.365 --> 44:30.866
For the local indicators, these were not applicable.

44:31.907 --> 44:37.769
And instead, it defaulted to not met, so it gives a false message about not meeting the standards.

44:39.290 --> 44:51.876
In terms of not met, the students who did not meet, they have been shrinking from the past three years in a total of 4.6% in language arts and math, 4.2%.

44:51.996 --> 44:52.156
Tom.

44:52.196 --> 44:52.496
Thank you.

45:06.078 --> 45:16.109
Hello, my name is Marisol Sardia, and I am the student counselor at the Guidance Charter School, and I just wanted to point out about, well, our EL students have been increasing.

45:16.369 --> 45:23.417
It went from 154 students to 190 students, and 14% of our students reclassified.

45:23.857 --> 45:27.481
According to the CELT report, we have been growing in

45:28.522 --> 45:31.664
and actually for our advanced students.

45:31.684 --> 45:38.508
So for example, in advanced, we grew in the past three years by 71% in early advanced.

45:40.529 --> 45:40.909
It will be 33%.

45:42.570 --> 45:48.494
Now, another thing I would like to point out is that our A through G courses are approved.

45:48.514 --> 45:49.775
44 of our courses are approved.

45:52.396 --> 45:54.637
Four or five of our courses are just pending.

45:54.697 --> 45:58.558
And we have until the end of this month to submit the rest of the classes as well.

45:59.359 --> 46:06.241
And just wanted to let you know that our graduation rate has greatly improved 100% this year.

46:06.301 --> 46:08.262
And that's our goal for next year as well.

46:10.203 --> 46:10.403
And Tom.

46:16.874 --> 46:18.655
Good morning, my name is Daniel Lee.

46:18.675 --> 46:21.578
I'm the Contracts CFO at the Guidance Charter School.

46:21.778 --> 46:30.625
And my previous experience in 10 years, over 10 years of school district and charter school audit is over 150 charter school and district audit yearly basis for 10 years.

46:31.906 --> 46:34.047
Just to give you a bullet point because we don't have a time.

46:34.267 --> 46:42.934
So the Guidance Charter School using four different auditor, outside auditor for 17 years and they never had, there's a one minor finding in 17 years and back in 2014 and 15.

46:44.635 --> 46:52.420
And so they're over every finance and internal control of financial statement and didn't find anything for different, for auditor.

46:53.161 --> 47:08.170
And also the reserve is built up for last 17 years and then the school has a budget at least five years next, even though we have a big lease payment that the financial is sustained and then we have a net income at least more than a million dollars every year.

47:08.950 --> 47:15.995
And then the school has to spend like more than district percentile about the school supply and everything for the kids in the budget.

47:16.615 --> 47:19.958
So the charter school is a 17 years community.

47:20.078 --> 47:20.958
Please support them.

47:21.259 --> 47:25.181
I mean, increasing enrollment every year, 17 years, increase our reserve every year.

47:25.762 --> 47:28.664
And I'm expecting support is favor for this.

47:28.964 --> 47:29.144
Thanks.

47:34.056 --> 47:34.477
Good morning.

47:34.557 --> 47:36.279
My name is Abdul Wahab Omira.

47:36.779 --> 47:41.765
I'm the president of the board of the Garten Charter School and one of the founders.

47:42.966 --> 47:47.792
In 1993, I started working for the Department of Correction and Rehabilitation as a chaplain.

47:49.085 --> 48:00.074
And I noticed that many inmates that came to my institution are betrayed by the school systems where they came from.

48:01.235 --> 48:06.440
The public school system failed them in that instead of going to college, they were sentenced to prison.

48:07.721 --> 48:10.443
That is why the main reason I started the charter school.

48:11.806 --> 48:22.313
to give the future generations of our beautiful country a fighting chance to be a good citizen and productive, instead of inmate costing the taxpayers between $40,000 to $60,000 a year.

48:23.654 --> 48:34.342
That is why the Guidance Starter School is one of the only schools in the world, or I guess in the nation, that we have our own canine units to sniff drugs and weapons, and that it did.

48:35.976 --> 48:41.024
And our students come to us to learn.

48:41.505 --> 48:47.835
Our students come to us after they were being bullied, offered drugs, and did not feel comfortable in the learning environment.

48:48.095 --> 48:48.376
Thank you.

49:02.028 --> 49:06.870
Hello everyone, my name's Benjamin and I'm going to talk about why I love this school.

49:07.650 --> 49:13.193
I love this school because we have a very good principal and a great director, Mr. Akhatib.

49:14.488 --> 49:27.151
We have great staff and parents and this school also teaches different languages like Arabic and we can say stuff like hi how are you and a lot of other stuff.

49:27.971 --> 49:37.153
We are worrying about the school closing lately and if it closes then I'll be homeschooled because I don't trust any other school.

49:37.773 --> 49:40.093
I love this school so please don't close it.

49:40.454 --> 49:41.754
That's why I love this school.

49:42.194 --> 49:42.494
Thank you.

49:54.943 --> 49:58.004
Good morning, I'm Jamira Eta, also known as Ben's mom.

49:58.904 --> 50:07.548
I can stand here and focus on how much I enjoy working here, how much I care and respect these people, and how much as a mother of three students, I love this school.

50:08.288 --> 50:10.089
But this isn't what keeps the school going, is it?

50:11.129 --> 50:11.529
It's not.

50:11.909 --> 50:12.550
Numbers is.

50:12.830 --> 50:13.490
Results are.

50:14.130 --> 50:18.612
So I'm here respectfully asking for you to carefully review the data presented by our team.

50:19.332 --> 50:21.333
Are we here trying to paint a perfect school?

50:21.953 --> 50:22.473
Of course not.

50:22.853 --> 50:24.214
There's always room for improvement.

50:25.441 --> 50:28.003
But isn't it true that it takes a village to raise a child?

50:28.603 --> 50:32.266
Well, this is a guidance village, raising 900 students.

50:32.847 --> 50:34.988
That's 900 families in our community.

50:36.029 --> 50:37.290
We're all here at Ford.

50:37.810 --> 50:38.271
We're ready.

50:38.711 --> 50:41.013
Imagine us with our shovels and our hard hats ready.

50:41.553 --> 50:44.375
Tell us what we need to improve on, and we're ready to do the work.

50:44.716 --> 50:45.056
Thank you.

50:55.242 --> 51:02.488
Hi my name's Iman and I'm here to tell you this straight from my heart that I love this school so much.

51:02.568 --> 51:04.709
It's one of the best things I've ever had in my life.

51:05.010 --> 51:05.690
It's the best.

51:05.950 --> 51:07.692
And I don't I never wanted to close.

51:21.067 --> 51:25.894
There are great teachers and it's always going to be the best school for everyone.

51:26.335 --> 51:26.816
Thank you.

51:34.512 --> 51:35.854
Hello my name is Ashley.

51:36.855 --> 51:40.059
I think the Guiding Shiner School was the best school I've ever been to.

51:41.660 --> 51:46.045
I'm really sad if you guys close the school because it's a second house for me.

51:46.806 --> 51:54.254
I've been there for like around eight years now and I think it's a great it's a great school for me for my sisters too.

51:54.435 --> 51:54.735
I have

51:56.458 --> 52:04.579
I never felt very happy from for being a great student there and I'm very excited for that school and hopefully you guys close it.

52:04.619 --> 52:04.860
Thank you.

52:16.408 --> 52:21.351
I had a whole speech planned out, but I'm on one of my kids.

52:21.491 --> 52:22.952
I'm the P-TECH president.

52:24.293 --> 52:27.015
I also am the committee chairperson for our Cub Scouts.

52:27.455 --> 52:29.977
As far as parents not being involved, that's just a lie.

52:30.217 --> 52:31.437
We're allowed on that campus.

52:31.498 --> 52:32.118
We are told

52:32.578 --> 52:41.223
Every day by our principal that come don't even call I want you to come I want you to come see that classroom And I have and I have been welcome.

52:41.383 --> 52:49.428
I am always welcomed on that campus And everybody else's as well My kids they're nine and ten.

52:49.468 --> 52:51.530
They'll be fourth and fifth graders if

52:52.310 --> 53:19.142
Discloses, I don't have another option Pumble school district is to their class sizes are too big and they have failed my child once and I don't know what we'll do we will move or we will homeschool or we will do something my kids are on their track to be an astrophysicist and veterinarian they scored much they scored above average on their last test they are inquisitive they're curious and they are being served well by guidance and

53:26.693 --> 53:27.253
Good morning.

53:27.473 --> 53:34.516
My name is Greta Small, and I have three grandchildren that attend the K-6 campus.

53:35.196 --> 53:47.021
And my first grader, he was having a problem keeping up academically, and he was sent to the office, and that's where he personally met Dr. Briggs, the principal there.

53:48.161 --> 53:52.143
And he began to cry, and Dr. Briggs told him, say, don't cry.

53:52.163 --> 53:53.984
Let's try to get to the problem.

53:54.785 --> 54:01.068
And Dr. Briggs really talked to him and explained to him, when you're having a problem, you have to let someone know.

54:01.348 --> 54:04.310
Because if you don't, no one knows that you're having a problem.

54:04.790 --> 54:08.971
And that really, really impacted my grandson, my six-year-old.

54:09.592 --> 54:11.872
He came home and he told me about it.

54:12.352 --> 54:18.374
And he also talked to some of his friends in the neighborhood, some of the other younger kids in the neighborhood.

54:18.814 --> 54:21.535
And he was just telling them, yes, I did wrong.

54:21.675 --> 54:23.076
I didn't handle things right.

54:23.436 --> 54:30.338
He said, but now I know how to handle things right so we can get down to the real problem.

54:30.738 --> 54:38.545
and that really has not only impacted me as a grandmother, but also my six-year-old and some of his friends.

54:39.005 --> 54:39.826
Thank you so much.

54:39.846 --> 54:53.677
I'll be translating for her.

54:53.697 --> 54:53.918
Buenos dias.

54:55.059 --> 54:55.299
Good morning.

54:55.319 --> 54:56.640
Mi nombre es Emma Cornejo.

54:58.417 --> 55:04.022
I am the mother of six students for the school that we're discussing.

55:04.322 --> 55:10.468
I'm very worried and saddened to see that my kids are saddened by the problem that the school is facing.

55:22.222 --> 55:27.487
As I mentioned last time, I've never had a problem with the school.

55:27.527 --> 55:31.730
Quite on the contrary, they've helped me.

55:31.750 --> 55:35.954
I've been able to come to them with the problem that I have.

55:46.530 --> 55:54.375
Without knowing the reason as to why I was asking for help, the school was willing to help me with transportation to be able to get my kids to school.

56:14.326 --> 56:18.571
I have a health problem that brings on a lot of emergencies.

56:28.390 --> 56:35.776
And I was very concerned because many times I would be hospitalized out of the flu and I wouldn't have anybody to pick up my children.

56:36.116 --> 56:38.138
And they were able to help me with the transportation.

56:38.158 --> 56:43.923
I am very grateful to them and everything they're trying to do for the school.

56:43.943 --> 56:44.483
And I thank you.

57:07.489 --> 57:08.269
Good afternoon.

57:08.349 --> 57:20.654
My name is Egenia Ramirez and I feel really sad why you guys are going to close school or I don't know if you guys are but please don't close it because it's the best school I ever had.

57:32.571 --> 57:35.374
Good morning, Lorraine Richards, California Teacher's Association.

57:35.414 --> 57:39.899
The district and county has denied renewal and CTA supports the denial.

57:41.100 --> 57:53.512
This charter, despite the long time in existence, has not done well for students and has issues with, as mentioned, special ed, IEP compliance, A to G,

57:54.714 --> 57:55.756
having been low.

57:57.439 --> 58:00.905
According to the dashboard, there's also a failed increase in mathematics.

58:01.245 --> 58:04.731
There is an orange pie for a suspension rate.

58:05.332 --> 58:07.897
Yale students have a lack of support too.

58:09.246 --> 58:17.789
There is also another mention regarding credential teachers not being at a high rate for that population.

58:18.429 --> 58:28.152
And if they also spent the money and had the high credential, the credential teachers, all those potential issues could have also been changed.

58:28.652 --> 58:31.173
So again, CTA supports the denial.

58:31.233 --> 58:31.513
Thank you.

58:37.535 --> 58:39.497
Eric Premack, Charter Schools Development Center.

58:39.677 --> 58:47.404
I typically avoid speaking out on schools where I don't know a ton about the situation, and this is not one of our organization's member schools.

58:47.484 --> 59:04.359
But after listening to the very long back and forth at the ACCS, and again, a little bit of the back and forth, and you've only heard a tiny slice of it today, I just felt compelled to speak out because we find the district's actions in this case to be very distressing and disturbing.

59:05.479 --> 59:11.069
Many of the allegations that you're hearing today, if you hear the thorough explanation behind them, you're going to

59:11.610 --> 59:16.032
find out that a lot of these are not very substantive.

59:16.072 --> 59:20.274
So, for example, there's this allegation that they bought a house for non-educational reasons.

59:20.334 --> 59:25.356
Well, they acquired the house because they needed an access easement to the site that they've acquired.

59:25.836 --> 59:35.360
And so it's just one of many examples of allegations that are being hurled here that I think have no substantive basis and I find very disturbing.

59:35.500 --> 59:39.582
And I hope that you'll have the time here to unpack this and get a fuller look.

59:39.762 --> 59:40.022
Thank you.

59:49.676 --> 59:53.562
And so now I think we're ready for board member questions.

59:54.383 --> 59:55.805
Want to take a break perhaps?

59:55.885 --> 59:56.145
Yes.

59:56.386 --> 59:56.646
All right.

59:56.686 --> 59:58.729
We will take a break and come back at 1020.

01:00:17.634 --> 01:00:19.155
All right, the board will reconvene.

01:00:19.175 --> 01:00:24.400
I want to stress that this is a continuation of item 21.

01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:28.943
We are on concerning the guidance charter school.

01:00:30.044 --> 01:00:33.307
So now we have time for board member questions.

01:00:34.148 --> 01:00:42.154
And I'd like to start by asking Los Angeles County to come up and a few questions for you.

01:00:48.144 --> 01:00:51.505
So, you had a three to one vote.

01:00:52.106 --> 01:00:54.126
How many members are on your board?

01:00:56.267 --> 01:01:00.228
So, you barely had a quorum at that meeting.

01:01:00.369 --> 01:01:00.969
So, okay.

01:01:01.009 --> 01:01:02.169
I just wanted to establish that.

01:01:02.189 --> 01:01:08.411
I don't know whether you had five or seven members and whether this was... Yes, we have seven and we had a quorum.

01:01:10.132 --> 01:01:12.653
Is it this red button?

01:01:14.135 --> 01:01:15.475
We have a seven-member board.

01:01:15.995 --> 01:01:18.696
That evening, there were four members, which is a quorum.

01:01:19.596 --> 01:01:20.596
Okay.

01:01:22.157 --> 01:01:27.338
And you never had a, you know, you only had a minute to present your findings.

01:01:27.418 --> 01:01:34.339
So, you know, I'd like to hear more about your findings and what the board's reasoning was.

01:01:34.359 --> 01:01:37.740
So the superintendent's recommendation was for

01:01:38.598 --> 01:01:59.386
denial, and based on the findings that were in the handout that we gave, the first one being that they did not meet the minimum academic criteria to be considered for renewal, an unsound educational practice, and we based that on many of the deficiencies within the petition that were mentioned before, EL programs, etc.

01:02:00.106 --> 01:02:13.966
But also looking at their past performance and the California Code of Regulations says that if they failed to meet the measurable pupil outcomes in their charter or failed to meet that minimum academic criteria, that is an unsound educational practice.

01:02:14.006 --> 01:02:15.748
So that was part of our findings as well.

01:02:18.021 --> 01:02:22.425
Multiple indicators show that they were demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement.

01:02:22.985 --> 01:02:37.779
We saw many of the operational issues that the district has pointed out in addition to some others that were mentioned by the CDE staff and also the petition deficiencies that were numerous.

01:02:40.825 --> 01:02:43.728
So, talk to me about the academic.

01:02:43.848 --> 01:02:56.938
When you look at the dashboard indicators and you look at the district, they're not, to me, wildly different from, you know, I've seen, you know, five reds and I don't see that here, you know.

01:02:57.859 --> 01:03:02.263
So, what measurable objectives, what can you say what those are?

01:03:02.619 --> 01:03:04.380
So we looked at CASP scores.

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:15.108
And as we know, with the dashboard, it was set up intentionally that you cannot look at the number of reds or blues to compare a school to school, because we're looking at both status and change.

01:03:15.629 --> 01:03:22.874
So we look at CASP data directly to look at what percentage of students are actually meeting or exceeding standards.

01:03:23.354 --> 01:03:25.276
That's a pretty clear metric.

01:03:25.616 --> 01:03:27.177
And so that's what we base this on.

01:03:27.297 --> 01:03:29.059
And then we disaggregate it by grade level.

01:03:29.679 --> 01:03:38.767
So that when we're comparing the school to school, we took the 3rd through 6th grade scores only to compare that to the other schools in the area, their 3rd through 6th grade.

01:03:39.187 --> 01:03:41.229
Same thing with 6th through 8th grade span.

01:03:41.709 --> 01:03:45.332
And then for the high school, we have 11th grade CASP scores only.

01:03:46.093 --> 01:03:52.958
Other indicators that we feel are terribly important for the high school would be that dropout rate and graduation rate.

01:03:52.978 --> 01:03:57.882
And that's what we used and we found that particularly for dropout rate,

01:03:59.326 --> 01:04:02.459
which is the last page of the packet that I provided earlier.

01:04:04.076 --> 01:04:12.700
that they perform lower than all of the high schools in the area, with the exception of three of the charter schools that are listed.

01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:17.182
Their graduation rate, cohort graduation rate for 2016 was only 72.7%.

01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:29.467
And their cohort dropout rate for that same year was almost 23%, which is about three times what the district, the high school districts is.

01:04:31.127 --> 01:04:31.467
Okay.

01:04:31.828 --> 01:04:34.490
Other questions by the county, by any board members?

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:34.790
Yes.

01:04:36.191 --> 01:04:37.592
Board members.

01:04:37.692 --> 01:04:51.364
I do have a question just on the data because I saw a discrepancy of their special ed service where the information we were shared with us is that it's 0.7, like less than 1% students with disabilities, but then they said they had 17%.

01:04:51.404 --> 01:04:54.026
Do you have a sense of what the enrollment of students with disabilities?

01:04:55.635 --> 01:05:06.402
When we looked up the 2016-17 enrollment demographics for Guidance Charter School, it showed a 7% of students with disabilities.

01:05:08.463 --> 01:05:11.065
Which is lower than the typical average of special ed students.

01:05:11.085 --> 01:05:11.725
Is that right?

01:05:11.845 --> 01:05:12.466
It is correct.

01:05:12.526 --> 01:05:18.710
And the Palmdale Elementary School District has a 13% special ed population.

01:05:19.330 --> 01:05:23.893
And the Antelope Valley Union High School District of that area is at 14% the same year.

01:05:27.346 --> 01:05:29.587
Okay, Board Member Burr, were you, yeah.

01:05:31.188 --> 01:05:33.549
I actually have a question of Lisa.

01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:43.154
Could you go back to the very beginning of your presentation, you talked about what the criteria are for renewal.

01:05:43.674 --> 01:05:48.217
And I'd like you to refresh our memory because I feel like we have conflicting data here.

01:05:48.557 --> 01:05:52.939
Some people are comparing here, some people are comparing here, using lots of different data.

01:05:52.979 --> 01:05:56.081
So could you tell us what we're supposed to base our decision on?

01:05:57.101 --> 01:06:26.201
So the Ed Code says that the entity that granted the charter, so this in essence would be the school district, they determined that the academic performance of the charter school is at least equal to the academic performance of the public schools that the charter school pupils would otherwise have been required to attend, as well as academic performance of the schools in the school district in which the charter school is located, taking into account the composition of the pupil population that has served at the charter school.

01:06:27.042 --> 01:06:40.523
And then it goes on to say the district shall consider increases in pupil academic achievement for all groups of pupils served by the charter school as the most important factor in determining whether to grant a charter renewal.

01:06:42.438 --> 01:06:54.983
You have, and I'm looking at your PowerPoint, I don't know if you want to pull it back up again, but the CDE findings, you're comparing it then to the schools that you just described in the statute.

01:06:55.283 --> 01:06:55.543
Yes.

01:06:55.943 --> 01:07:00.645
And did you, but the one piece I'm a little, I just wonder about because I don't know these other schools.

01:07:01.705 --> 01:07:07.428
It says, taking into account the pupil population being served by the charter.

01:07:08.368 --> 01:07:13.312
Do we know that these schools here are comparable in pupil composition?

01:07:13.993 --> 01:07:17.036
We did look at ensuring that the enrollments were comparable, yes.

01:07:17.416 --> 01:07:17.656
Okay.

01:07:18.217 --> 01:07:23.321
And then the second issue I wanted just to raise is the issue about credentialing.

01:07:24.522 --> 01:07:27.085
I didn't hear anything about credentialing and that renewal.

01:07:27.805 --> 01:07:28.306
Correct.

01:07:28.406 --> 01:07:31.048
But I heard lots of allegations about credentialing.

01:07:31.509 --> 01:07:35.112
And we've had this conversation many times around charters before.

01:07:35.792 --> 01:07:39.693
There is flexibility allowed to charters about credentialing.

01:07:39.733 --> 01:07:46.935
Their court teachers have to have credentials that match their subject matter, but they do have a lot of flexibility in non-court teachers.

01:07:47.515 --> 01:07:49.816
So I just want to get that on the record.

01:07:49.876 --> 01:07:55.217
I think we need to be really crystal clear when we're communicating with LEAs about what their requirements are.

01:07:56.257 --> 01:07:57.918
so that we don't continue to have that.

01:07:58.278 --> 01:08:02.380
But more importantly, that people understand that's not really an issue for us.

01:08:03.261 --> 01:08:07.563
It may be way down the list of a concern on a policy basis.

01:08:08.023 --> 01:08:12.425
But for purposes of renewal, we've got very specific criteria that do not include that.

01:08:12.895 --> 01:08:15.355
But what's the core teacher certification?

01:08:15.375 --> 01:08:17.316
Yeah, I couldn't sort that out in this.

01:08:17.656 --> 01:08:21.797
That's what I was trying to hone in on and I got lost on this.

01:08:22.517 --> 01:08:31.258
We did, the information we pulled was from the district findings about the, in their oversight, the teacher credentialing issues that they did find.

01:08:32.058 --> 01:08:41.100
The district may want to clarify some of that a little bit, but that was just part of the additional information we provided as what the district found in their oversight.

01:08:41.431 --> 01:08:48.153
Yeah, and did you compare their certification of this school to the district?

01:08:48.834 --> 01:09:04.459
A lot of districts around me, some of them extremely wealthy, are really having teacher recruitment problems and are using teachers that are interns and so on.

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:08.181
So this is not a time when we're flush with teachers.

01:09:08.641 --> 01:09:08.801
Right.

01:09:08.841 --> 01:09:10.221
We didn't we didn't look at that, sir.

01:09:10.261 --> 01:09:12.142
We didn't look at the other schools.

01:09:12.182 --> 01:09:16.123
We really just pulled that information from part of the district's oversight.

01:09:16.283 --> 01:09:19.323
We didn't do a comparison across other schools for teacher credentialing.

01:09:21.204 --> 01:09:25.004
OK, board member Ortiz Lacone is next.

01:09:25.845 --> 01:09:30.446
My question was actually for the county since they were up here regarding the pending lawsuits.

01:09:30.666 --> 01:09:33.746
And if you could tell us, are these still pending lawsuits?

01:09:34.706 --> 01:09:37.107
Was this something that you can give us an update on?

01:09:38.837 --> 01:09:39.998
the discrimination lawsuits.

01:09:40.218 --> 01:09:44.582
I will have our general counsel, Deputy General Counsel Patrick Saldana address that.

01:09:46.183 --> 01:09:49.385
So as of the date of our board hearing, those were active lawsuits.

01:09:49.485 --> 01:09:52.528
I haven't checked to see whether they have been settled since that time.

01:09:53.569 --> 01:10:03.697
But shortly after our board hearing, a fourth lawsuit was actually filed by the EEOC alleging that a female tutor was being paid at a different rate than a male tutor.

01:10:03.757 --> 01:10:05.378
And that is currently an active case.

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:13.341
And so these are very disturbing in the grounds of them as well.

01:10:13.401 --> 01:10:22.127
But is there anything else that you found since then or that whether it be these pending lawsuits or anything else that we should be aware of?

01:10:24.248 --> 01:10:31.553
I'm not aware of any other lawsuits since that time, but we also haven't run another check to see if there's been anything since then.

01:10:32.854 --> 01:10:36.476
Their counsel may be able to provide an update as far as the status of those cases.

01:10:37.864 --> 01:10:40.966
But these are all allegations at this point, just clearing this up.

01:10:41.046 --> 01:10:41.387
Yeah.

01:10:41.567 --> 01:10:44.149
There is no decisions on any of these.

01:10:44.289 --> 01:10:45.170
Is that?

01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:45.890
That is correct.

01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:49.793
There was no judgment on any of these or any trial that had taken place at that time.

01:10:52.215 --> 01:10:52.335
OK.

01:10:52.475 --> 01:10:53.236
Board member Rucker.

01:10:56.604 --> 01:10:58.585
Well, I do also have some questions for the county.

01:10:58.605 --> 01:11:00.307
So thank you for staying at the microphone.

01:11:00.847 --> 01:11:10.333
I want to begin by saying that, you know, it's always it's always an assumption that when charter appeals get to the board level, that the emotions are quite high.

01:11:11.054 --> 01:11:24.663
And as I prepared and did the study and reading on these on this material, they were it was clear that there were two different narratives that were evolving, that the board is being asked to consider in making this decision.

01:11:25.343 --> 01:11:29.927
And in listening today, there's an additional part to this narrative that has come up.

01:11:30.467 --> 01:11:49.562
Part of what I heard today and part of the information that was shared with the board that falls in the category of things we're not supposed to consider, but they're out there are some very inflammatory accusations that have been made about the staff and about activities at the school.

01:11:50.262 --> 01:11:56.208
But what I would like to ask you to clarify for me is information that's actually in these packets.

01:11:56.628 --> 01:12:07.479
There's information from the charter about the performance, the academic performance of their program that has them performing as well as the top half of the schools in the district.

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:14.106
Then there's information that's provided from the dashboard by the county office that shows them performing

01:12:16.818 --> 01:12:26.608
about as well as most of the schools in the school district that these students would return to if the school itself was closed.

01:12:27.148 --> 01:12:29.450
Is there a difference in the data?

01:12:30.598 --> 01:12:39.105
that the charter actually used in presenting to us and the data that you looked at, or did you all look at the same data and come up with two different conclusions?

01:12:39.385 --> 01:12:51.996
And I'm asking that with all seriousness because it's material to what the two very different narratives about the quality of this school is based on your perspective and the perspective of the school and the district itself.

01:12:53.086 --> 01:12:59.649
We pull our data directly from what's publicly available through the CDE, and that's what's represented in the packet here.

01:13:00.430 --> 01:13:08.054
Because we have a SPAN school and we have in Antelope Valley, there are multiple elementary school districts and a large high school district.

01:13:09.195 --> 01:13:28.088
Rather than separating the list by resident school and then what would be comparable schools, we put all of the schools that are available in that area for students to choose and families to choose and then disaggregate it by the grade level because we felt that that really gives a comparison of all of the schools in that area.

01:13:28.128 --> 01:13:33.552
The only thing that we removed would be community day schools or alternative continuation schools.

01:13:33.985 --> 01:13:39.108
And are you aware, and this may not be a question you can answer, so it's okay if you say I don't know.

01:13:39.528 --> 01:13:49.353
Are you aware if there has been any conversation with the school as a result of their bringing their petition to you on appeal concerning school change or school improvement?

01:13:49.413 --> 01:13:54.996
What it is that would inform any work the school would need to do to improve the performance of their students?

01:13:55.036 --> 01:13:59.538
Was any of that contemplated in their petition or in their LC and their LCAP?

01:14:01.058 --> 01:14:10.721
We did not see plans for future improvement, if any, as we do with some of our other charter petitions on renewal where it's clear that there are some areas for improvement.

01:14:11.682 --> 01:14:13.382
We have not really heard any of that.

01:14:13.442 --> 01:14:24.306
The charter petition itself had not seemed to have been updated to really reflect some of the populations that they serve or some of the new legal requirements related to those populations.

01:14:24.386 --> 01:14:27.269
That's why I'm asking that question because I couldn't find that either.

01:14:27.289 --> 01:14:31.674
So I was hoping that was just information that just wasn't given to us because I didn't find that.

01:14:32.194 --> 01:14:32.495
OK.

01:14:33.055 --> 01:14:34.817
I'm going to ask the school the same question.

01:14:35.378 --> 01:14:35.778
Thank you.

01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:40.263
Could I ask the school, the school petitioners to come up?

01:14:45.709 --> 01:14:46.550
The school itself.

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:59.922
OK, so I'm going to ask you the same question that I just asked the county in submitting your petition to the county for them to approve your charter.

01:15:00.502 --> 01:15:11.845
There are some clear gaps in performance for your students yet in the petition in the presentation you made to us for the for this presentation today, you know, the flags are flying and everything is great.

01:15:12.405 --> 01:15:16.207
In my opinion, the flags are at half staff and everything is not great.

01:15:16.807 --> 01:15:18.128
I looked at your LCAP.

01:15:18.789 --> 01:15:28.313
What is your improvement plan to address raising the achievement of these students, particularly for those that your dashboard says that there are performance problems?

01:15:28.373 --> 01:15:38.859
I do see in the dashboard that there were improvements, but they're not significant enough to say that you are outpacing the other schools in the district, in my opinion.

01:15:39.555 --> 01:15:41.677
And it is only my opinion, but I am one vote.

01:15:42.117 --> 01:15:53.385
So I want to understand in your LCAP, how do you believe that you're going to be going forward addressing improvement for those students in a way that shows an impact?

01:15:53.405 --> 01:15:56.067
Because I didn't see it in this petition.

01:15:56.127 --> 01:16:07.255
And if academic improvement or academic progress is supposed to be the principal determiner about this charter, what is it that you've done that makes me think you know what you're doing to improve this?

01:16:07.759 --> 01:16:17.363
You know, I am the executive director, so I'm going to bring my two principals who actually already put the plan together and was approved, and I would like to call Dr. Briggs.

01:16:18.203 --> 01:16:22.225
You have, I don't know if you're including in the PowerPoint presentation.

01:16:23.566 --> 01:16:25.687
Was it included in the action plan?

01:16:26.327 --> 01:16:31.469
We took it, you know, we had included, we had the different... Well, I'd like to start with your high school principal, if you don't mind.

01:16:31.509 --> 01:16:32.029
Yeah, okay.

01:16:35.202 --> 01:16:37.985
No, I'm high school, middle and high.

01:16:39.766 --> 01:16:44.631
So with WASC, we have an action plan that's going on.

01:16:45.432 --> 01:16:47.694
And it involves several components.

01:16:48.675 --> 01:16:58.804
And I'm going to identify each one of them that are actually happening, but nobody ever asked us to give them in writing except WASC.

01:16:59.325 --> 01:17:00.386
OK, I understand.

01:17:00.772 --> 01:17:15.784
And that's our instructional program having core and intervention, making sure we address those needs, making sure that we fulfill the textbook requirements for core and intervention, making sure that our master's... Let me ask you, what does that mean?

01:17:16.404 --> 01:17:18.406
The textbooks.

01:17:18.726 --> 01:17:19.867
Yeah, I understand that.

01:17:19.947 --> 01:17:20.688
What does that mean?

01:17:20.748 --> 01:17:23.290
Making sure... Every child has access to that textbook.

01:17:24.151 --> 01:17:27.373
Does that finding mean every child did or did not have access to that?

01:17:27.393 --> 01:17:29.695
No, every child does have access to that textbook.

01:17:30.666 --> 01:17:32.486
Well, why was that a WASC finding?

01:17:33.167 --> 01:17:34.447
No, there was no WASC finding.

01:17:34.507 --> 01:17:42.249
I'm just going over the plan that we have in place at the school to ensure that we know what we're doing to improve student outcomes.

01:17:42.549 --> 01:17:42.869
Okay.

01:17:43.329 --> 01:17:44.629
So, but that wasn't a finding?

01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:46.570
No, the... Okay, go on.

01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:59.433
Our master schedule needs to serve all the students with core intervention, make sure that's properly designed, making sure we have fully credentialed teachers and EL certified teachers.

01:18:01.646 --> 01:18:23.695
monitoring student achievement, lesson pacing schedules, ongoing instructional assistance and support to teachers, professional learning communities, and monthly collaboration for staff, and fiscal support to back up all of the above that I just mentioned.

01:18:24.108 --> 01:18:32.976
Okay, so what changes does that mean you believe you've made in your program based on all of those things you've enumerated that are part of the WASC report?

01:18:33.377 --> 01:18:36.179
What changes were specifically recommended for your school?

01:18:36.479 --> 01:18:37.000
From WASC?

01:18:38.641 --> 01:18:43.446
WASC mentioned more efficient use of technology.

01:18:45.625 --> 01:18:52.691
Making sure that our RTI program during the school day was implemented with fidelity.

01:18:53.932 --> 01:19:00.338
And making sure that the staff received appropriate professional development from outside sources.

01:19:01.559 --> 01:19:03.520
Those were the three specific findings.

01:19:05.959 --> 01:19:08.281
So I'm going to ask you this teacher credentialing question.

01:19:08.341 --> 01:19:13.064
Is it at the middle school and high school or at the elementary school where the teacher credentialing issue?

01:19:13.084 --> 01:19:15.025
The credentialing question came up.

01:19:15.906 --> 01:19:18.908
I came on board 2016-17.

01:19:19.568 --> 01:19:31.636
And when I came on board, the audit, the verbal audit identified several teachers that were misassigned or did not have the right credentials.

01:19:31.796 --> 01:19:33.998
At the middle school, high school or at the elementary school?

01:19:34.018 --> 01:19:34.118
Both.

01:19:34.578 --> 01:19:34.898
At both?

01:19:35.118 --> 01:19:35.459
Both, yeah.

01:19:35.999 --> 01:19:38.421
And what was the subject areas they were misassigned in?

01:19:38.981 --> 01:19:42.404
I believe ASL sign language.

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:47.408
There was one section that had the wrong title that did not match the teacher's credential.

01:19:48.189 --> 01:19:52.352
Every time we made a decision to rectify something, we would call the county office.

01:19:52.712 --> 01:19:53.173
I understand.

01:19:54.114 --> 01:19:55.795
Was ASL sign language the only one?

01:19:58.337 --> 01:20:00.499
The, oh wait, high school right now.

01:20:02.262 --> 01:20:11.030
ASL was one, the yearbook, the medical and health class teacher had to fulfill some classes to get her CTE credential.

01:20:11.311 --> 01:20:13.973
She got that straightened out.

01:20:14.534 --> 01:20:18.978
Then there was... And for the students taking that, were they getting credit for science or for CTE?

01:20:20.359 --> 01:20:25.602
they were getting for the medical program, CTE.

01:20:26.563 --> 01:20:28.283
Then there was the yearbook teacher.

01:20:28.364 --> 01:20:37.789
We had to make sure that the classes, the sections she had, were within the description of her credential.

01:20:38.529 --> 01:20:45.133
Again, we checked with the county office to make sure that the decisions we made were accurate, compatible, legal.

01:20:46.875 --> 01:21:00.150
In middle school, if I could extend the answer, middle school I remember now, there was one teacher with a multiple who was teaching single subject and I immediately switched that around so he could teach multiple subjects.

01:21:01.551 --> 01:21:05.616
And, you know, whatever areas were identified, that was the case.

01:21:06.010 --> 01:21:06.250
Okay.

01:21:06.290 --> 01:21:07.131
Thank you very much.

01:21:09.192 --> 01:21:11.454
And I will know because I'm not done.

01:21:12.015 --> 01:21:18.660
So with the WASC report, were there any change that did require any changes in your LCAP based on the information or recommendations?

01:21:19.180 --> 01:21:24.144
No, I have the full report and there was no mention of LCAP needed to be changed.

01:21:24.423 --> 01:21:24.763
Okay.

01:21:24.803 --> 01:21:31.026
So there was nothing in the academic program or in the intervention or improvement plan that would have affected your LCAP?

01:21:31.367 --> 01:21:36.169
Because I didn't see any changes in your LCAP that were submitted or done for the free.

01:21:36.189 --> 01:21:36.529
All right.

01:21:36.829 --> 01:21:39.891
Those three areas were the three specific areas they pinpointed.

01:21:40.208 --> 01:21:44.110
OK, and then for the elementary print, you're the doctor, you're the elementary principal.

01:21:44.531 --> 01:21:52.796
OK, so I just I just I'm just going to ask you for the improvement plan again, because your academic achievement does say that there's some gaps identified.

01:21:53.156 --> 01:22:04.062
But because you're the person who made the presentation to the board about the academic program, are you saying that there is no academic concerns for your school or that there are some things that need to be addressed?

01:22:04.443 --> 01:22:06.384
No, there are a number of things that need to be addressed.

01:22:06.424 --> 01:22:07.585
That's not what you talked about.

01:22:07.805 --> 01:22:08.145
I'm sorry.

01:22:08.165 --> 01:22:09.866
So let me clarify, if you don't mind.

01:22:10.865 --> 01:22:14.028
And I'll say that with any school, there are a number of areas that need to be addressed.

01:22:14.168 --> 01:22:16.210
Again, but that's not what you talked about.

01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:18.632
Our school has areas in which we need to address.

01:22:18.792 --> 01:22:24.777
And we've addressed those areas by implementing, we have, our data is driving our instruction.

01:22:24.837 --> 01:22:32.704
We have a viable RTI plan that is looking at improving the academic needs of every student.

01:22:33.264 --> 01:22:39.128
We have our EL program is one that meets the needs of our students.

01:22:39.949 --> 01:22:41.410
Our SPED program as well.

01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:48.794
One of the issues that I'm going to, if you don't mind, our SPED program, we know that we had issues with our SPED program.

01:22:48.955 --> 01:22:49.595
We know that.

01:22:50.335 --> 01:22:55.179
But our SPED program was outsourced to our chartering district.

01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:00.143
These are the kinds of things that I would like to have known.

01:23:00.623 --> 01:23:05.546
This is what I meant when I said there's a third narrative that is rising up today.

01:23:05.947 --> 01:23:16.014
That's, for me, important for me to know, you know, where the gap is in the performance of your school, particularly with the two student populations you named, your EL program and your SPED.

01:23:16.574 --> 01:23:23.520
Knowing that you are contracting out services to your SPED students stops me from asking the next question about the SPED students.

01:23:23.881 --> 01:23:25.863
I'm going to make my last question.

01:23:25.923 --> 01:23:34.590
Since I know you contract out services for your SPED students, what exactly are you doing to address the performance gap of your English learners?

01:23:34.650 --> 01:23:35.551
What is your plan?

01:23:35.571 --> 01:23:37.233
Because I didn't read that.

01:23:37.513 --> 01:23:39.535
I do apologize for not providing it.

01:23:39.895 --> 01:23:43.636
But our plan is we do a separate benchmark for our EL students.

01:23:43.976 --> 01:23:50.658
And that benchmark shows us where our students are in addition to where they are with the state and LCAP or LPAG.

01:23:50.818 --> 01:23:57.660
But with that, we look at our students and we provide them before school, after school, and also during school.

01:23:59.129 --> 01:23:59.629
assistance.

01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:02.311
And with that, we are plugging the gaps.

01:24:02.371 --> 01:24:10.975
When we bring the parents in on Saturdays, we have programs that are going on during the summer in the morning that I have to address those needs of those students.

01:24:11.335 --> 01:24:20.819
So we are doing everything we can beyond the bell to work with those students to help them achieve to be proficient, above proficient.

01:24:21.064 --> 01:24:37.171
OK, I understand that the reason I'm asking that question is because I heard the counselor talk about the high numbers of ELs that are being reclassified and the reclassification report doesn't quite match with what the academic performance of those students as a subgroup shows on the dashboard.

01:24:37.191 --> 01:24:44.555
So that's why I'm trying to understand what your program is, because that was not something I clearly understood when I was studying your

01:24:44.975 --> 01:24:46.976
petition before I came to the hearing today.

01:24:47.036 --> 01:24:54.721
So there's a gap in the data that I don't, that doesn't quite match up for me about what was reported on reclassification that I don't understand.

01:24:55.181 --> 01:25:04.426
So I appreciate what you just said, but I have to tell you, frankly, you used a lot of mega terms to explain what you're doing for EL students and not a lot of specifics.

01:25:04.806 --> 01:25:11.430
But I do, but I'm thankful to know that you recognize there is a performance issue and that there is an improvement plan that's needed.

01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:14.954
But what you just explained still doesn't really fully answer my question.

01:25:14.974 --> 01:25:22.363
But I do appreciate what you did explain, because I have more information than I did when I read through what was submitted in writing.

01:25:22.403 --> 01:25:23.404
So I appreciate that.

01:25:25.427 --> 01:25:26.188
Karen Valdez.

01:25:29.514 --> 01:25:33.238
So I can ask you this question, and I'd also like to ask the same question to the county.

01:25:34.199 --> 01:25:44.430
Looking at your ending fund balances for the next three years out, and we know that there are projections, and you're going anywhere from $10 million to $16 million, how do you end up with a reserve of over 100% each year?

01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:55.205
So the school has basically to say that the budget is probably planned well.

01:25:55.645 --> 01:26:06.494
I mean, we spend probably 55% of the revenue, majority of the SFF right now is spent for the teacher salary and benefit, which is significantly lower than actually

01:26:07.294 --> 01:26:07.934
the district.

01:26:08.235 --> 01:26:09.915
I'm not saying that our teachers are underpaid.

01:26:10.015 --> 01:26:10.596
I don't think so.

01:26:10.736 --> 01:26:15.578
We have overflowed teachers, and the teachers and student ratio is pretty competitive with the district.

01:26:16.178 --> 01:26:22.061
So, and then we still spend like more than 10% of the supplies directly to the student.

01:26:22.341 --> 01:26:25.283
So I think we enough for spending it, but we have a well-planned.

01:26:25.443 --> 01:26:29.225
Our admin part, not the teacher, is there are probably

01:26:30.646 --> 01:26:38.427
But something like I'm the contract, the CFO, then my department is back office has 10 people.

01:26:39.005 --> 01:26:44.949
which is probably well budget management and they're more independent than actually hire six people at the site and then paid all the benefits.

01:26:44.989 --> 01:26:51.414
So school has all the plan as a make a better plan and save the money for probably over the years.

01:26:51.974 --> 01:26:56.237
So we spend more than 80% our revenue is spent for the educational system.

01:26:56.577 --> 01:27:02.421
I mean, I think that's the required from the recommendation from state that we spent enough money and that but we have a well-planned

01:27:03.462 --> 01:27:10.944
reserved every year for the last 17 years now, which is $9 million as of now, and then you probably plan to reserve more in the future.

01:27:11.764 --> 01:27:16.586
I mean, but there's unnecessary expenditure, probably one that we just eliminated.

01:27:17.106 --> 01:27:23.528
I mean, but 100% reserve is a problem that like a charter school has no place to go if we don't have money.

01:27:24.048 --> 01:27:28.229
And then we have a big, like less than probably 2007 recession going on.

01:27:28.769 --> 01:27:35.394
And then now we have a well plan for the strategy plan for the next five or 10 years, make sure this school is sustainable for the next 10 years.

01:27:35.934 --> 01:27:37.775
That's the building project associated with it.

01:27:38.156 --> 01:27:43.119
I mean, we have a, yes, $31 million bonds, and then we have a plan for next five years of budget.

01:27:43.519 --> 01:27:45.441
The enrollment growth is steadily.

01:27:45.601 --> 01:27:48.483
Like, we not jump up from the, like, probably 200 to 1,000.

01:27:48.683 --> 01:27:50.084
Right now, the enrollment is 900.

01:27:50.144 --> 01:27:50.744
It goes to the 9,000.

01:27:50.844 --> 01:27:52.906
And 1,200, 1,400, we maxed out because of facility capacity.

01:27:57.649 --> 01:28:09.552
So based on that, like in normal projection, we still have a net income at the bottom and make sure that all the money we can support as we did to all the students.

01:28:10.012 --> 01:28:14.013
At the same time, we make sure our budget and the money is sustainable.

01:28:14.053 --> 01:28:19.894
We probably have to reserve more in the future and make sure there's an emergency that we can able to spend that money for the student.

01:28:21.127 --> 01:28:23.870
So I've never heard of this kind of a reserve level.

01:28:23.930 --> 01:28:25.031
I mean, typically it's 5%.

01:28:25.992 --> 01:28:31.036
So when you think about your total budget, you said you you're spending about 55% on staffing.

01:28:31.096 --> 01:28:31.597
Is that correct?

01:28:31.637 --> 01:28:32.217
Is that what I do?

01:28:32.277 --> 01:28:33.298
Right now is currently 55.

01:28:33.419 --> 01:28:37.863
It might be increased because stirring purse rate is going to be increased probably next three years more.

01:28:38.383 --> 01:28:42.847
And typically for most districts, it's about 85% of the budget is spent on staffing.

01:28:42.927 --> 01:28:44.769
And why is there that discrepancy with you?

01:28:44.829 --> 01:28:48.652
I mean, there's substantially low cost for the admin side.

01:28:49.113 --> 01:28:52.376
So district has a lot of admin, the classified employee.

01:28:53.863 --> 01:29:06.234
So I'm talking about your organization, your school, and I'm looking at the salary of the executive director, and it goes up to $270,000, which is, you know, you're comparable to a superintendent, but that's what superintendents in larger districts make.

01:29:06.694 --> 01:29:10.778
So I guess when you're saying you're paying low, who are you paying low?

01:29:11.775 --> 01:29:20.562
He's the executive director, but like, for example, accounting clock, payroll department, probably a little bit lower than actually compared to the district.

01:29:21.142 --> 01:29:26.987
I mean, all the probably sub-teacher rate, I mean, probably a little bit lower, but not really significant low.

01:29:27.107 --> 01:29:31.891
Yes, but in comparison, those are low-paid employees anyway.

01:29:31.971 --> 01:29:35.133
And so, anyway, that was one question I would like to ask.

01:29:35.734 --> 01:29:36.074
Excuse me?

01:29:36.694 --> 01:29:37.394
Yeah, he's not making 270.

01:29:37.474 --> 01:29:38.474
I don't know where 270 is.

01:29:38.494 --> 01:29:42.275
Well, there's a scale in the CDE.

01:29:42.315 --> 01:29:43.335
It was from 215 to 270.

01:29:43.395 --> 01:29:45.356
That was what was listed.

01:29:45.776 --> 01:29:46.156
I'm sorry?

01:29:47.276 --> 01:29:47.616
Okay.

01:29:47.676 --> 01:29:49.437
Can you put this on the record?

01:29:49.937 --> 01:29:51.237
We can't hear what you're saying.

01:29:51.437 --> 01:29:51.677
Oh, yeah.

01:29:51.717 --> 01:29:52.557
His salary is not 270.

01:29:52.597 --> 01:29:53.218
His salary is 217.

01:29:53.258 --> 01:29:59.879
The range is 215 to 270 in the... And just for the information... ...statement for a school of 900.

01:29:59.939 --> 01:30:00.479
Wait a minute.

01:30:00.499 --> 01:30:01.639
It's 215,000 is what you're saying?

01:30:05.384 --> 01:30:05.924
270.

01:30:05.404 --> 01:30:05.924
217,000 for exactly.

01:30:05.944 --> 01:30:05.924
270.

01:30:06.004 --> 01:30:06.224
Correct.

01:30:06.284 --> 01:30:06.224
17.

01:30:06.304 --> 01:30:06.524
17.

01:30:06.324 --> 01:30:06.524
Okay.

01:30:06.544 --> 01:30:07.024
The pay range.

01:30:07.044 --> 01:30:07.164
217,000 not 270,000.

01:30:07.204 --> 01:30:07.304
Yes.

01:30:07.364 --> 01:30:07.584
Okay.

01:30:07.604 --> 01:30:08.425
I couldn't hear.

01:30:08.485 --> 01:30:08.545
Yes.

01:30:08.605 --> 01:30:09.445
The pay range goes from 215 to 270.

01:30:09.485 --> 01:30:11.085
That's what I was speaking to.

01:30:11.105 --> 01:30:12.986
So could I ask the county a question then in terms of the budget?

01:30:13.006 --> 01:30:13.346
Thank you.

01:30:33.848 --> 01:30:45.662
So just an open-ended question, do you have any fiscal concerns with the reserve amount that they are holding and how much is really going to educational needs as opposed to building?

01:30:47.034 --> 01:30:51.515
So one of our findings about, we did have a finding about lacking a reserve.

01:30:51.555 --> 01:30:58.417
And what we mean by that is they don't have a specific line item set aside to make sure that reserve is not spent.

01:30:59.257 --> 01:31:03.158
But as far as having a positive ending cash balance, yes, we did see that.

01:31:03.778 --> 01:31:11.080
We are concerned and we did raise that concern about the money going to things such as the increases in rent.

01:31:11.540 --> 01:31:12.800
They currently are on a site.

01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:17.063
through the district, which they pay less than $200,000 for rent.

01:31:17.343 --> 01:31:23.908
And they're moving into a new campus, which they're going to pay almost $2 million in rent and operations.

01:31:23.968 --> 01:31:26.570
And that was a concern.

01:31:27.230 --> 01:31:33.695
For the new campus locations, we're looking at $1.6 million.

01:31:35.136 --> 01:31:38.798
If you're looking at the leases moving forward, there's been a tremendous increase.

01:31:38.838 --> 01:31:40.299
It does have to do with the fact that they've

01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:47.006
now have their own building that they are building, but we did think that that was significant.

01:31:47.927 --> 01:31:48.307
Annually?

01:31:48.988 --> 01:31:50.029
Yes, per year.

01:31:50.229 --> 01:31:58.437
And that it also, in that particular area, that's a very high rate for the cost of land and rent.

01:31:59.838 --> 01:32:05.124
But they plan to expand students, so have you projected how that would affect this?

01:32:05.868 --> 01:32:14.213
I mean, if you spend more and you increase your student body by a lot, there's a, I mean, you've got to put a net here rather than, it's an increase.

01:32:15.034 --> 01:32:18.675
So we do analyze it based on what they're projecting their enrollment to be.

01:32:19.055 --> 01:32:24.037
Right now, I believe they're at 750 something students.

01:32:24.457 --> 01:32:28.959
And they're looking at for next year being over 900 close to a thousand.

01:32:29.399 --> 01:32:37.342
It's not as significant of an increase in student body that and space wise that we think warrants that big of an increase.

01:32:38.102 --> 01:32:40.163
They have a longer term plan to increase.

01:32:40.623 --> 01:32:42.464
I mean, if they build a facility, they're not

01:32:43.871 --> 01:32:46.335
They weren't planning to have it mostly empty, I don't think.

01:32:47.097 --> 01:32:48.059
No, no, not at all.

01:32:48.940 --> 01:32:51.084
We know that they are planning to increase their enrollment.

01:32:51.104 --> 01:32:51.305
Yeah.

01:32:51.525 --> 01:32:51.765
Okay.

01:32:51.786 --> 01:32:52.767
And then one last question.

01:32:52.888 --> 01:32:56.053
On their LCAP, did you review their LCAP in the process?

01:32:56.598 --> 01:33:13.340
So we review the LCAP and we do look at the LCAP as far as goals and what's in their charter petition, the LCAP light version to make sure that they are addressing all of the eight state priorities and including the required metrics and we did not find that that was the case.

01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:15.681
that they were not meeting all priorities?

01:33:15.762 --> 01:33:20.565
That they did not include all of the required metrics in their plan moving forward.

01:33:20.605 --> 01:33:22.687
And what about the financial part of the LCAP?

01:33:22.747 --> 01:33:27.550
We did not, we don't really review what was... For charters?

01:33:27.650 --> 01:33:27.850
Yeah.

01:33:28.091 --> 01:33:28.291
Okay.

01:33:28.331 --> 01:33:28.631
Thank you.

01:33:28.651 --> 01:33:28.891
Thank you.

01:33:30.693 --> 01:33:32.354
Okay, Board Member Schwartz.

01:33:33.646 --> 01:33:35.407
So I have some county questions as well.

01:33:35.467 --> 01:33:39.448
So could you talk about what you found in the conflict of interest?

01:33:39.468 --> 01:33:45.109
Because in my reading of the documentation, I was incredibly disturbed by the conflict of interest.

01:33:45.449 --> 01:33:49.830
We're really careful about that, and I've worked in schools my whole career.

01:33:49.850 --> 01:33:53.671
So could you share the findings of the conflict of interest?

01:33:53.852 --> 01:33:55.112
And I have a few more questions.

01:33:59.565 --> 01:34:11.243
So we had concerns about some of the related party transactions here as far as the executive director, also being the founder of the American Islamic Institute, where they are building this facility and paying this higher rate of rent.

01:34:12.497 --> 01:34:19.902
We had concerns about some of these policies which allowed for up to 49% of the board to essentially be financially interested parties.

01:34:20.163 --> 01:34:20.923
Can you say that again?

01:34:20.943 --> 01:34:21.764
Up to 49% of the board?

01:34:21.784 --> 01:34:24.185
Up to 49% of the board could have essentially financial interests.

01:34:37.851 --> 01:34:42.394
We believe it's five board members on the board, so it would be up to two of those.

01:34:42.674 --> 01:34:46.296
And they would allow, they'd be allowed to have financial interest in what?

01:34:49.158 --> 01:34:53.120
I'm sorry to quiz you, but obviously the conflict interest is of concern.

01:34:53.801 --> 01:34:58.123
Yeah, it was just a statement in their bylaws.

01:35:01.277 --> 01:35:09.822
And they also allow the creation of committees to approve contracts to which the corporation is a party and one or more of its directors has a material financial interest.

01:35:11.182 --> 01:35:14.524
We felt that their policies were not consistent with government code section 1090.

01:35:15.105 --> 01:35:25.030
Yeah, they allow contracts with individuals who have a direct financial interest in those contracts as long as that individual recuses themselves from the vote.

01:35:28.752 --> 01:35:35.416
For the related parties, there is a foundation that also has the same members involved as well.

01:35:36.117 --> 01:35:38.498
So we have 900 kids here.

01:35:38.578 --> 01:35:38.958
I'm L.A.

01:35:39.018 --> 01:35:39.319
County.

01:35:39.359 --> 01:35:41.040
I understand the Palmdale area.

01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:47.123
There's 900 kids and families or 750 kids who've been going to the school for a long time.

01:35:47.604 --> 01:35:48.564
We're in July.

01:35:48.825 --> 01:35:52.667
School opens in August, maybe in a month, six weeks at the most.

01:35:54.512 --> 01:36:02.495
There must have been, or I wonder if there's been a plan, because they've been denied twice already, so we're the final appeal.

01:36:03.636 --> 01:36:07.057
Have you asked what the plan is for these students?

01:36:07.377 --> 01:36:09.018
Are there space in the local school?

01:36:09.078 --> 01:36:12.960
I mean, we got kids crying in front of us, parents who are planning.

01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:16.241
I know as a parent and a grandparent, I'm worried about where my kids go.

01:36:17.161 --> 01:36:20.383
They got a school half built and kids here.

01:36:21.423 --> 01:36:25.508
What's the plan if we uphold the decisions?

01:36:26.389 --> 01:36:27.451
Have you explored that?

01:36:28.647 --> 01:36:32.109
And that's obviously a better question for the district to respond to.

01:36:32.129 --> 01:36:36.891
But we have asked the district, you know, if you have space, are you ready to reabsorb these kids?

01:36:37.051 --> 01:36:42.894
And they have said yes, that they do have space within their programs currently for the students at the charter school.

01:36:43.254 --> 01:36:55.461
And like you said, because they've been denied by the district in the past since then, you know, the district always keeps in mind that the school may end up being closed if the appeals are not successful.

01:36:55.541 --> 01:36:58.102
And I would hope that the school had been informing their families

01:36:58.542 --> 01:36:59.622
throughout this process.

01:36:59.722 --> 01:37:04.023
Could I have the charter first and then the district to address the issue of the students?

01:37:04.043 --> 01:37:16.085
I mean, these kids came with their parents' guidance for a hope of a safe and wonderful school to provide them a good place to grow and thrive.

01:37:16.185 --> 01:37:22.566
And so I'm worried about kids now and what we're going to provide for them and what the plans are.

01:37:22.606 --> 01:37:25.447
So first, and then I'd ask the district to follow up.

01:37:27.054 --> 01:37:35.075
year in July and school opens in August, if the decision stays the way it's been, what are your plans for your students?

01:37:36.201 --> 01:37:56.152
Okay, right now we have today's appeal, and we also have applied for Antelope Valley High School District, which at the beginning, they promised our support, and at the date of the vote, they voted three to two.

01:37:56.653 --> 01:37:57.173
For what?

01:37:57.653 --> 01:37:58.594
To deny us.

01:37:59.034 --> 01:37:59.994
For a new charter?

01:38:00.014 --> 01:38:00.735
For a new charter.

01:38:01.315 --> 01:38:16.160
That charter has been already appealed to the county, and I want to just clarify something about the county vote, because there's a lot of... I need to just clarify, and I'm glad you can do that, but when you... So you applied for a new charter.

01:38:16.540 --> 01:38:18.761
In case this doesn't go through, you were denied.

01:38:18.841 --> 01:38:19.721
What's your timing?

01:38:19.761 --> 01:38:20.942
I'm worried about the kids.

01:38:21.662 --> 01:38:23.423
We have actually our legal advisor.

01:38:29.452 --> 01:38:31.193
The timing is obviously extremely challenging.

01:38:32.393 --> 01:38:32.694
You're right.

01:38:32.734 --> 01:38:36.175
It's July 12th and school would open and I think in actually less than a month.

01:38:36.595 --> 01:38:42.258
So there is another charter, a new charter petition that was submitted to Antelope Valley Union High School District.

01:38:42.278 --> 01:38:44.018
So Palmdale's an elementary district.

01:38:44.119 --> 01:38:45.919
This is the high school district where they're located.

01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:51.022
That charter was denied three to two and it's currently on appeal to L.A.

01:38:51.042 --> 01:38:51.362
County.

01:38:51.602 --> 01:38:52.582
What's the timing for that?

01:38:52.842 --> 01:38:53.583
I think it's August.

01:38:54.443 --> 01:38:56.684
So what are the plans for these kids?

01:38:57.245 --> 01:39:02.948
I mean, I'm hoping you're thinking about them needing a place to start school in less than a month.

01:39:03.028 --> 01:39:04.109
What's the plan?

01:39:04.589 --> 01:39:07.030
Are you going to keep them homeschooled until this gets resolved?

01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:07.851
What's the thinking?

01:39:08.970 --> 01:39:17.616
You know, right now we are basically doing everything we can to keep the school open and we have August, because we have a July 24th hearing.

01:39:18.016 --> 01:39:20.717
Actually, Daryl Brown is here.

01:39:20.737 --> 01:39:22.839
He can tell you that this is what he told me.

01:39:23.199 --> 01:39:26.441
We have July 24th hearing and we have August decision.

01:39:26.461 --> 01:39:31.284
You know, God willing, you know, God forbid that you don't approve it today.

01:39:32.405 --> 01:39:38.590
And that will be our plan to open by August 24th.

01:39:38.970 --> 01:39:45.275
But you've had several denials, so I'm just asking, do you have any backup plans for these families and these children?

01:39:45.295 --> 01:39:51.581
I know you're hoping, and I understand that, but any insurance or safety net for the families?

01:39:51.601 --> 01:39:55.204
All I can tell you is that we're going to exhaust all of our legal options.

01:39:55.822 --> 01:40:07.544
OK, so let me just ask the district then, because we've got 750 students here and I'm just concerned that the students have a place to go because it sounds like the timing is tight.

01:40:07.604 --> 01:40:09.745
So school's going to open before the appeals are done.

01:40:09.885 --> 01:40:13.125
So can I just have a representative from the district?

01:40:14.005 --> 01:40:19.986
Let's say school's going to open and this school can't open because of what happens?

01:40:20.646 --> 01:40:21.407
What's the plan?

01:40:21.607 --> 01:40:23.387
I just I'm worried for our kids.

01:40:28.604 --> 01:40:28.764
Ms.

01:40:28.824 --> 01:40:29.084
Rouse?

01:40:29.465 --> 01:40:29.665
Yes.

01:40:29.785 --> 01:40:30.425
Great question.

01:40:31.266 --> 01:40:35.328
And I can assure you that in the Palmdale School District, we're ready to take all the students in.

01:40:35.748 --> 01:40:36.889
We have enough space.

01:40:37.829 --> 01:40:39.430
However, it is their choice.

01:40:40.131 --> 01:40:41.772
We have an independent studies program.

01:40:41.852 --> 01:40:45.534
We have two other charter schools that are doing a fantastic job.

01:40:46.349 --> 01:40:49.930
Our school district has been very proactive in going after grants.

01:40:50.210 --> 01:40:54.212
And I think the charter school mentioned that all of our middle schools now are magnet schools.

01:40:54.692 --> 01:40:59.154
We received a $15 million grant from the feds to improve our middle schools.

01:40:59.594 --> 01:41:00.834
We have dual immersion schools.

01:41:01.314 --> 01:41:02.615
We have K-5 schools.

01:41:03.295 --> 01:41:09.737
And our K-5 schools are very low in numbers because what we decided to do was to create academies at the middle schools.

01:41:10.197 --> 01:41:17.800
So we pushed all the middle school students, 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students, because we are an elementary school district, to the middle school.

01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:26.523
We opened up a brand new AeroSage school that can take up to 1,200 students.

01:41:26.923 --> 01:41:28.624
But we have others, Shadow Hills,

01:41:29.724 --> 01:41:35.448
I mean, we have enough space and enough seating in the regular school if the parents would like to come back.

01:41:35.969 --> 01:41:36.969
We'd like to take them back.

01:41:37.389 --> 01:41:42.473
I'm not saying that we wouldn't, but that's not the argument that we wanted to bring to you.

01:41:43.093 --> 01:41:46.816
You know, the argument that we wanted to bring to you is that we are concerned about the students.

01:41:47.336 --> 01:41:48.537
So, the staff is here.

01:41:48.557 --> 01:42:00.903
I don't know if they want to add anything else, but again, Palmdale School District does have the space, sitting space, and has used the budgets appropriately to put into our classrooms technology.

01:42:01.023 --> 01:42:02.904
All of our classrooms have permethean boards.

01:42:03.584 --> 01:42:15.290
A lot of training goes out to make sure that the teachers are well trained, that we have experts in English language development, that we have a great rate of reclassification.

01:42:15.310 --> 01:42:16.991
I mean, we take into account all of those.

01:42:17.552 --> 01:42:23.535
And not only that, we're implementing what we call the Palmdale Promise, which says every school will have a parent room.

01:42:23.695 --> 01:42:28.458
And let me tell you, we are reaching that goal because we want our parents to be involved with our schools.

01:42:29.598 --> 01:42:33.821
We are extremely happy to receive the students, but it will be a parent choice.

01:42:36.182 --> 01:42:37.803
Okay.

01:42:37.823 --> 01:42:39.364
You want to ask a different question?

01:42:41.445 --> 01:42:41.805
Go ahead.

01:42:43.847 --> 01:42:45.588
I actually have two questions for you.

01:42:45.848 --> 01:42:56.233
One, I was concerned by the public testimony from the bond folks who said that they had received assurance from the district when the bonds were being issued.

01:42:58.094 --> 01:43:01.095
And they based their decisions on those assurances.

01:43:01.315 --> 01:43:07.619
So that's a huge deal to me that they've got bonds out there and a brand new building that's going to sit there.

01:43:08.099 --> 01:43:09.279
So can you help me with that?

01:43:09.319 --> 01:43:12.201
And then the second one, I'll ask it while you're all up there.

01:43:13.141 --> 01:43:15.986
I will allow our legal counsel to address that question.

01:43:16.006 --> 01:43:18.810
Okay, but let me ask the second question and you can figure out how you want to do it.

01:43:19.591 --> 01:43:27.843
I'm again concerned by we have very conflicting data and I want to know whether the academic data that you presented is the identical data

01:43:28.423 --> 01:43:33.068
to what the department is providing to us for our basis of decision.

01:43:33.368 --> 01:43:35.110
Because the counties is not.

01:43:35.210 --> 01:43:36.131
I went through the counties.

01:43:36.191 --> 01:43:36.972
It's very different.

01:43:37.592 --> 01:43:44.379
And so it's really hard for us to sort out what is really a comparable piece of data on which we can make a decision.

01:43:46.381 --> 01:43:47.922
Which question would you like us to answer?

01:43:47.962 --> 01:43:48.523
The first one?

01:43:49.544 --> 01:43:50.665
So let's answer the first one.

01:43:52.640 --> 01:44:00.024
The letters which there's been a lot of made of are nothing more than what's the status of this district of this charter school right now.

01:44:00.665 --> 01:44:02.125
And that was as of February 2017.

01:44:02.166 --> 01:44:02.706
And what changed?

01:44:05.667 --> 01:44:06.267
A couple of things.

01:44:06.387 --> 01:44:09.128
First, with respect to the credentialing.

01:44:09.148 --> 01:44:12.010
That doesn't have anything to do with the financial statements.

01:44:12.290 --> 01:44:12.690
That's fine.

01:44:13.310 --> 01:44:14.731
But those were the things in our letters.

01:44:15.291 --> 01:44:19.712
But you were giving us assurances that they were financially sound.

01:44:19.752 --> 01:44:21.513
No, we didn't give any assurances like that.

01:44:22.033 --> 01:44:29.176
The only thing we said was, hey, they're in good standing, meaning we hadn't revoked their charter, that they were a charter in good standing.

01:44:29.836 --> 01:44:33.918
And what changed was when they submitted their application the following year,

01:44:34.799 --> 01:44:38.083
Then we went and engaged in our regular due process and review.

01:44:38.103 --> 01:44:45.173
And in the part of that review, the other things came up in terms of annual oversight responsibilities.

01:44:45.253 --> 01:44:48.377
Those were not coming up in your annual oversight for 17 years.

01:44:49.355 --> 01:45:00.409
What came up for us were we did have concerns with respect to allegations that were being made, and we made investigation on a case-by-case basis on individual transactions.

01:45:01.029 --> 01:45:04.413
So we reviewed those individual transactions at that time.

01:45:04.794 --> 01:45:08.018
So that's the reference, because there were some very serious allegations.

01:45:08.078 --> 01:45:08.759
We looked into it.

01:45:09.259 --> 01:45:12.360
And in fairness, we determined, eh, there wasn't a problem.

01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:23.624
However, none of those issues are the issues that are being raised with respect to the financial and then with respect to the review of a new request for charter, including the performance outline.

01:45:23.804 --> 01:45:27.445
Our letter only said, hey, are they in good standing right now?

01:45:27.865 --> 01:45:29.306
Yeah, they're good standing right now.

01:45:29.786 --> 01:45:30.386
Right now.

01:45:31.086 --> 01:45:33.187
We weren't making a reference to forever.

01:45:34.868 --> 01:45:35.968
That was just at that moment.

01:45:35.988 --> 01:45:37.689
Can I hear about the academic performance?

01:45:37.949 --> 01:45:38.249
Thank you.

01:45:40.874 --> 01:45:45.075
Yes, so what we did was we just looked at DataQuest, and we were able to just pull the numbers.

01:45:45.095 --> 01:45:49.876
So we had requested from the charter to give us a list of where the students would have attended, what their homeschool would have been.

01:45:50.516 --> 01:45:52.017
And it was a several-page list.

01:45:52.437 --> 01:45:55.658
And we just looked, and basically every one of our schools was accounted for.

01:45:56.358 --> 01:45:58.798
And so we just literally just started plugging in all the numbers.

01:45:58.999 --> 01:46:03.500
Based on DataQuest, what we gave you was exactly, very straightforward, exactly what it is.

01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:04.580
OK, thank you.

01:46:08.626 --> 01:46:22.715
But I want to, before Karen, I want to allow the charter school to respond to these comments that were made to board member Straus' question on the conflicts and those sorts of things.

01:46:22.795 --> 01:46:32.241
I think they deserve the right to be able to speak to those issues because those, we just found out the salary is very different than I was told.

01:46:36.783 --> 01:46:37.510
All right, back again.

01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:39.721
I've become a professional speaker now.

01:46:41.281 --> 01:46:43.742
So I'm going to point out a few things that we discussed.

01:46:43.882 --> 01:46:49.264
But the first thing, I'll probably come back and explain a little bit more about the budget, about how come we have so much reserve.

01:46:49.744 --> 01:47:02.688
And then I just, at the top of my head, when they're talking, the district talking, yes, we are in Prop 39 for the high school, that we don't pay the regular market value of the pay of the facility use.

01:47:02.969 --> 01:47:05.089
So we only pay the 1%, which is a huge save.

01:47:05.149 --> 01:47:06.710
Now we go back to the normal payment.

01:47:07.290 --> 01:47:08.951
I mean, $2 million for how many?

01:47:08.991 --> 01:47:09.692
What's the scale for it?

01:47:09.732 --> 01:47:13.134
Like, 100 scale for it.

01:47:13.534 --> 01:47:19.339
And I studied the market value about the scale for area, and then based on the ADA, yes, we're going to have an increase.

01:47:19.399 --> 01:47:24.302
Our ADA is going to be probably, yes, $100,000 pretty much.

01:47:24.502 --> 01:47:25.343
Like I said, yeah.

01:47:25.863 --> 01:47:27.504
I mean, the land and the building itself.

01:47:30.026 --> 01:47:37.288
That's a pretty huge building, and we make it ready for the last 16 years to be ready for the kid in Palmdale community.

01:47:37.608 --> 01:47:38.548
That's first thing.

01:47:39.329 --> 01:47:40.829
Conflict of interest, the second thing.

01:47:40.989 --> 01:47:42.650
The conflict of interest is very sensitive.

01:47:42.790 --> 01:47:50.272
So the school made a decision that LOC, a foundation, the executive director from the school is nothing to do with it.

01:47:50.452 --> 01:47:51.292
We have a separate board.

01:47:51.932 --> 01:47:55.313
I'm the advisory person, and I directly report to the board directly.

01:47:55.573 --> 01:47:57.754
I'm the only one, not the only one,

01:47:58.694 --> 01:48:00.874
LSE board and foundation, we have a monthly meeting.

01:48:01.615 --> 01:48:05.375
And then once the decision is made, we report to the executive director.

01:48:05.415 --> 01:48:07.716
So ED reports to the school as an information section.

01:48:08.356 --> 01:48:10.096
So conflict of interest is mentioned.

01:48:10.116 --> 01:48:11.636
I don't know what part is they talking about.

01:48:11.996 --> 01:48:15.257
But they have a totally separate board and a totally separate control.

01:48:15.837 --> 01:48:18.818
And then I don't know where this conflict of interest issue is from.

01:48:19.078 --> 01:48:20.138
Then I just want to hear.

01:48:20.178 --> 01:48:21.558
And they're never asking me directly.

01:48:21.638 --> 01:48:23.198
So I never had a chance to speak up.

01:48:23.298 --> 01:48:27.519
So I want to address these two things first before moving on under the section.

01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:37.585
So I wonder if the conflict of interest, I mean, there were clear listing in our preparation materials of conflict of interest concerns in several areas.

01:48:38.066 --> 01:48:44.970
I'm wondering if first LA County needs to be clear so then you can counteract what we're being told.

01:48:45.511 --> 01:48:48.012
Obviously, it's a concern, but we want to hear both sides of it.

01:48:51.515 --> 01:48:53.256
Do you know, do you want to address it?

01:48:53.276 --> 01:48:54.256
Dr. Briggs?

01:48:56.798 --> 01:48:56.878
Okay.

01:48:57.459 --> 01:48:58.439
Okay.

01:48:58.700 --> 01:49:05.005
First of all, one of the points made, I think by the county, was about the 49% interested persons.

01:49:05.045 --> 01:49:05.986
That was in the bylaws.

01:49:06.426 --> 01:49:12.151
What that is in reference to, what that specifically meets, is the requirements of the Political Reform Act and the Corporations Code.

01:49:12.791 --> 01:49:16.374
I know this board is familiar with the government code section 1090 debate, right?

01:49:16.414 --> 01:49:17.956
So we're not going to go down that road.

01:49:20.615 --> 01:49:22.276
Terrific, so we won't go down that road.

01:49:22.296 --> 01:49:23.798
So that's what the 49% means.

01:49:24.218 --> 01:49:32.165
On the LLC, there is an LLC corporation that holds, that is responsible for the bond, holds title for the facility.

01:49:32.685 --> 01:49:42.434
That structure is exceedingly common among charter schools that are using the SB 740 rental reimbursement that's available to them through the facilities grant.

01:49:42.914 --> 01:49:48.179
This format has been approved again and again by the California School Finance Authority, so we're all within that.

01:49:48.519 --> 01:49:55.783
And I guess the last piece I'll say is there are not personal financial interests that are being played out here, that are in conflict.

01:49:56.603 --> 01:49:58.864
So with that, I guess you wanted the county to come up?

01:50:00.425 --> 01:50:00.685
Okay.

01:50:01.846 --> 01:50:04.587
Yeah, no, we already heard the county's view on this.

01:50:05.047 --> 01:50:10.830
And, you know, I'm old, so I've got to get this big letter because the little print wouldn't work for me, you know.

01:50:11.731 --> 01:50:12.411
But again,

01:50:15.347 --> 01:50:20.411
The district did state that once they did their forensic audit, there was no issues.

01:50:21.953 --> 01:50:23.934
They did a forensic audit and there was no issues.

01:50:24.035 --> 01:50:26.617
And this is the letter in which they schemed over.

01:50:27.878 --> 01:50:29.659
I just blew it up so I could read it.

01:50:31.341 --> 01:50:37.046
And in addition to when the district spoke of

01:50:38.869 --> 01:50:45.671
the letter being a good standing, it was a little bit more than, yeah, they're in good standing right now.

01:50:47.212 --> 01:51:02.417
This states, the guidance charter school authority authorized by the Palmdale School District, the charter school is currently in good standings with PSD, other than with respect to the teacher credentialing issue referenced in the letter.

01:51:02.978 --> 01:51:04.198
And this was dated February 15, 2017.

01:51:07.918 --> 01:51:14.041
And this letter, the other big letter, I'm sorry, was dated the day before my birthday.

01:51:14.061 --> 01:51:15.202
So I'm going to always remember this.

01:51:15.642 --> 01:51:16.042
February 7, 2017.

01:51:18.883 --> 01:51:27.587
So the conflict of interest, they must have come after the 16th of February, 2000, or the 18th.

01:51:27.667 --> 01:51:29.708
Excuse the big letters.

01:51:30.509 --> 01:51:32.090
The 16th of February, 2017.

01:51:33.250 --> 01:51:34.791
But we were never notified of anything.

01:51:37.398 --> 01:51:38.179
This was all we had.

01:51:39.159 --> 01:51:40.500
This was all we had.

01:51:40.781 --> 01:51:41.081
Okay.

01:51:41.121 --> 01:51:41.501
Thank you.

01:51:41.521 --> 01:51:46.545
Do we have a board member Valdez and I'd like to at least get a motion on the floor here.

01:51:48.766 --> 01:51:52.169
I know I'm going to ask her to make a motion after that.

01:51:52.189 --> 01:51:55.071
And then if we want to have more discussion after the motion, we can have it.

01:51:55.692 --> 01:51:57.313
So this is for the district.

01:51:57.753 --> 01:51:58.754
A question for the district.

01:52:07.066 --> 01:52:19.073
So part of this challenge is district annual oversight and how you engage in it, what process you use, how deeply you go in and what feedback you get and the conversations that you have in an ongoing manner.

01:52:19.473 --> 01:52:26.316
But speaking of the bond and the letters that we were just shown, but there is a debt.

01:52:26.597 --> 01:52:29.078
And so you it has been denied by you.

01:52:29.538 --> 01:52:33.740
But while you were doing oversight, the bond was put into place.

01:52:33.961 --> 01:52:34.541
Is that correct?

01:52:36.310 --> 01:52:41.835
And so the bond debt, if we don't approve it today, does the debt go to you?

01:52:43.856 --> 01:52:44.837
Who does the debt go to?

01:52:48.917 --> 01:52:51.578
The district isn't a party to that obligation.

01:52:51.618 --> 01:52:53.779
We have no obligation under those circumstances.

01:52:53.979 --> 01:52:55.720
So could I ask the bond people this question?

01:52:55.760 --> 01:53:01.502
Where does the debt go to if the district, if the charter school is not approved today?

01:53:01.522 --> 01:53:09.285
And it's my understanding that the school district would be responsible for it because they were doing oversight at the time.

01:53:12.333 --> 01:53:15.776
The borrower is the Guidance Support Services, LLC.

01:53:15.796 --> 01:53:17.118
The LLC that was created as Ms.

01:53:17.138 --> 01:53:19.520
Ruley talked about under this structure.

01:53:19.980 --> 01:53:21.702
And the borrower is obligated.

01:53:22.083 --> 01:53:27.348
Certainly, it happened under the watch of the district and the oversight of the district.

01:53:27.708 --> 01:53:34.836
And the district, as you've heard, was involved in that process, including communicating with bondholders and

01:53:35.556 --> 01:53:59.426
Underwriters and and providing the assurances and representations that have been talked about both in the letters and in separate conference calls as well And so the district is a part of this and I think there there has been Communications that that if there is an issue here, I mean this impact the district is not Separate and apart from the impact of a non-renewal at this stage.

01:53:59.486 --> 01:54:01.447
So while they may not be a party to

01:54:01.827 --> 01:54:05.808
to the borrowing documents, they certainly have been involved as the authorizer.

01:54:06.408 --> 01:54:11.329
So the district has no obligation if the school is not approved and does not exist?

01:54:12.269 --> 01:54:14.929
No, I cannot say that they do not have an obligation.

01:54:14.969 --> 01:54:17.430
That's a legal issue I'm not prepared to address.

01:54:17.490 --> 01:54:18.070
Okay, thank you.

01:54:20.430 --> 01:54:27.492
Okay, I'm going to ask our liaison to talk about the ACCS meeting and then Board Member Strauss will make a motion.

01:54:31.878 --> 01:54:41.405
So, Member Holliday and I attended the ACCS meeting and there was a considerable amount of kinds of questioning that we've had today.

01:54:41.425 --> 01:54:49.811
The ACCS did move to approve guidance by a vote of five to three, a split vote.

01:54:50.772 --> 01:54:55.755
The questions, they found it also challenging to dissent to

01:54:57.777 --> 01:55:14.836
review comparisons of different schools to guidance and yet the information over the last couple of years in terms of the percent meeting standard in ELA and math was

01:55:17.839 --> 01:55:22.340
discouragingly low in their perception and worrisome.

01:55:24.081 --> 01:55:28.662
And so they did feel like the academics were an issue and a concern.

01:55:31.463 --> 01:55:37.285
This board has gone into probably a more in-depth discussion about some of the other concerns.

01:55:37.385 --> 01:55:44.307
I appreciate member Burr reminding us all that the issue of credential is limited with charters to core teachers.

01:55:45.167 --> 01:55:50.751
primarily, and so taking that a little bit off the table.

01:55:52.472 --> 01:56:05.540
But the, and I appreciate having the attorney for the petitioner here to talk about the conflicts of interest and what that bylaw was, said, and how

01:56:08.602 --> 01:56:26.825
Typical that is or normal that is in legal language, but I think that the ACCS also struggled with Well Struggled with how large the school is and and what would happen with the students if the school was not approved and

01:56:27.385 --> 01:56:56.394
I think they also struggled with the fact that it seemed that the school had been in operation for 17 years and just got a letter from the district a year and a half ago saying they were in good standing and that although the district has provided data that indicates that they've sent letters of concern to the school about various credential issues, they've never risen to the level of notices of concern or a legal kind of level.

01:56:57.214 --> 01:57:10.178
And so it feels like it's, feels like that, it feels odd that it has not come to a higher level of concern and then suddenly it is.

01:57:10.579 --> 01:57:18.081
And yet the data on the student achievement, the low student achievement is definitely concerning.

01:57:18.681 --> 01:57:26.564
And so that's why there was a split vote at the ACCS and why it's not, I'd say, an easy decision.

01:57:27.719 --> 01:57:28.720
OK, board member Strauss.

01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:38.188
So let me just say, I just want to thank all the community and parents and kids who came today and the staff and and the county and the district.

01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:41.531
This one's an emotional one and a difficult one.

01:57:41.551 --> 01:57:46.356
I think we've all read the CD analysis, the written materials.

01:57:46.756 --> 01:57:49.919
Obviously, the lots of questions is because we have concerns.

01:57:49.979 --> 01:57:51.781
And I'll just say my own concerns.

01:57:52.421 --> 01:57:53.702
I'm worried.

01:57:53.862 --> 01:57:58.745
Parents brought their kids over 17 years to a school with hope that they would have a better opportunity.

01:57:58.765 --> 01:58:07.191
I know the high desert area, and I believe in the mission of trying to create a great opportunity and a choice for parents.

01:58:08.132 --> 01:58:10.713
That being said, I have a lot of concerns.

01:58:11.013 --> 01:58:17.518
Clearly, academically, charters have some flexibility that traditional schools don't have, and yet

01:58:17.958 --> 01:58:29.328
When I look at graduation rate, cohort dropout rate, EL achievement rate, I'm concerned about the lack of academic achievement.

01:58:29.348 --> 01:58:42.079
That being said, it is a parent choice, but I still think I'm concerned about an ambitious enrollment plan which triples the enrollment when we don't have success for 750 kids right now.

01:58:42.780 --> 01:58:44.081
So that's a concern for me.

01:58:45.891 --> 01:58:48.534
I've never seen a school with 100% reserve.

01:58:48.654 --> 01:58:57.161
That being said, I personally think maybe some of that more money should have been spent on the educational needs for kids, although that's a local decision as well.

01:58:58.363 --> 01:59:02.466
I worry so much about the kids and the families and choice opportunities.

01:59:03.708 --> 01:59:09.313
This board has always supported choice opportunities and good charters, but I think with the

01:59:10.689 --> 01:59:18.952
the pending lawsuits, although they're not approved, the possible discrimination, the middle of July, and we don't have a place for these kids.

01:59:19.332 --> 01:59:20.672
I just am very, very concerned.

01:59:20.712 --> 01:59:23.713
And I just have to say, I can't support the renewal.

01:59:24.354 --> 01:59:27.935
And I would move the CDE recommendation.

01:59:29.815 --> 01:59:30.175
Second?

01:59:30.215 --> 01:59:30.696
To deny.

01:59:31.796 --> 01:59:32.336
Second to that?

01:59:32.516 --> 01:59:33.136
I'll second it.

01:59:35.517 --> 01:59:36.397
Okay.

01:59:36.598 --> 01:59:37.738
Any further board discussion?

01:59:39.403 --> 01:59:43.185
Let's call Executive Director, call the roll starting over at this side.

01:59:43.205 --> 01:59:43.406
Okay.

01:59:45.847 --> 01:59:46.388
Jayden Gray.

01:59:48.589 --> 01:59:49.349
Nikki Sandoval.

01:59:51.091 --> 01:59:51.151
Aye.

01:59:51.171 --> 01:59:51.791
Trish Williams.

01:59:54.112 --> 01:59:54.173
Aye.

01:59:54.433 --> 01:59:54.973
Mike Hurst.

01:59:55.173 --> 01:59:55.373
No.

01:59:56.414 --> 01:59:57.074
Eileen Strauss.

01:59:57.515 --> 01:59:57.615
Aye.

01:59:58.235 --> 01:59:58.655
Sue Burr.

01:59:59.016 --> 01:59:59.156
No.

02:00:00.917 --> 02:00:01.998
Feliza Ortiz-Lucon.

02:00:02.018 --> 02:00:02.078
Aye.

02:00:03.679 --> 02:00:04.219
Karen Valdez.

02:00:04.259 --> 02:00:04.379
Aye.

02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:06.420
Patricia Rucker.

02:00:07.721 --> 02:00:07.881
Aye.

02:00:07.901 --> 02:00:08.882
Okay, the recommendation passed.

02:00:09.747 --> 02:00:15.149
Okay, the board will adjourn until 11, recess until 1130.

02:00:19.670 --> 02:00:28.773
The CD recommendation is that the charter petition be denied and therefore the charter petition has been denied.

02:00:30.774 --> 02:00:33.535
The board needs six votes and we had six votes.

02:00:47.028 --> 02:01:03.878
Okay, the board will reconvene and we have now item 22, the petition for the establishment of a charter school, Latitude 37.8 High School, denied by Oakland Unified and the Alameda County Board.

02:01:04.597 --> 02:01:06.257
So this is a public hearing.

02:01:06.818 --> 02:01:14.500
Our procedure is that we will have a presentation by the California Department of Education and hear their recommendation.

02:01:15.020 --> 02:01:24.382
Then the board will ask technical questions if they have technical misunderstandings or uncertainties about this presentation.

02:01:25.023 --> 02:01:26.703
Then we'll have the public hearing.

02:01:26.903 --> 02:01:29.764
Each side will have 10 minutes to make a presentation.

02:01:30.484 --> 02:01:35.688
Then we'll have public comment, one minute each for people that want to comment before the board.

02:01:36.248 --> 02:01:43.534
And then the board will deliberate and ask further questions, I'm sure, of various people that we've heard from after that.

02:01:43.734 --> 02:01:48.958
So Lisa is here from the department to make their recommendation and their analysis.

02:01:54.838 --> 02:02:03.504
August 23rd, 2017, the Oakland Unified School District voted to deny the petition of latitude 37.8 by a vote of 6 to 1.

02:02:04.344 --> 02:02:11.809
November 20th, 2017, the Alameda County Office of Education voted to deny the petition by a vote of 7 to 0.

02:02:12.489 --> 02:02:18.874
The petitioners subsequently submitted a petition on appeal to the State Board of Education on March 29th.

02:02:20.854 --> 02:02:33.164
The CDE's recommendation is that the State Board hold a public hearing to approve the request to establish 37.8 High School, a 9-12 charter school under the oversight of the State Board with the following conditions.

02:02:33.924 --> 02:02:44.332
Evidence that Latitude has received the funding anticipated from each of the commitment letters identified in the petition and that Latitude will provide the CDE with a revised 2018-19 budget to include these commitments.

02:02:48.991 --> 02:03:03.380
The CDE recommendation is based on finding that the school has a sound educational program, that they will be demonstratively likely to successfully implement the program provided that the petitioner secures the funding as stated in the petition.

02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:08.563
And we find that they have a reasonably comprehensive description of most of the charter elements.

02:03:11.175 --> 02:03:20.752
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools met on July 12, 2018, and the Advisory Commission moved staff's recommendation to approve the petition to the State Board of Education.

02:03:21.393 --> 02:03:24.479
The motion passed by six votes to one abstention.

02:03:26.826 --> 02:03:30.547
Some background on the school, Latitude is an education for change school.

02:03:30.747 --> 02:03:34.968
It is proposing to enroll 50 pupils in grade nine for the 18-19 school year.

02:03:34.988 --> 02:03:37.128
It plans to grow to 320 pupils in grade nine through 12 in 2022-23.

02:03:37.809 --> 02:03:40.169
And Latitude has secured a facility for the 50 pupils for this school year.

02:03:51.618 --> 02:04:02.784
The educational program, Latitude's mission is to facilitate self-directed, passion-driven learning that leverages the assets and resources of the city to provide pupils with personalized and authentic learning experience.

02:04:03.585 --> 02:04:14.971
Single integrated approach driven by personalization, relevance, integration, and creativity under four pillars of the pupil learning experience that is outlined in their petition.

02:04:18.143 --> 02:04:25.590
In terms of the ability to implement the program, during our initial financial analysis, the multi-year financial plan was not fiscally viable.

02:04:25.831 --> 02:04:34.439
They included revenues such as Measure N and Measure G that were available only to district-approved charter schools in Oakland Unified.

02:04:34.980 --> 02:04:42.087
And they also included public charter school grant program funds, which they have yet to apply for, and some other philanthropic revenues.

02:04:44.258 --> 02:04:59.526
And we did look at their financials understanding that now, particularly the Measure N and Measure G funding that was no longer available to them, we had some concerns about how those funds would then be, how the budget would then be able to proceed without those funds and also the grants.

02:05:00.306 --> 02:05:10.396
So we did take a look and our financial concerns were addressed provided that the funding described is received prior to the opening of the school year, which is part of our conditional approval.

02:05:10.977 --> 02:05:18.944
So that would be the commitment from the home office that is stated in the petition and also letters of commitment that are totaling over a million dollars.

02:05:19.245 --> 02:05:21.407
So those are part of our conditional approval.

02:05:23.433 --> 02:05:30.903
In terms of deficiencies in the charter elements, if approved by the State Board, the following charter elements need to be clarified by the petition.

02:05:31.624 --> 02:05:39.635
One is in terms of governance and just providing some clarification on the compensation of services in the petition that is different than what's in the bylaws.

02:05:40.556 --> 02:05:50.306
And then also in terms of admissions and expulsion and expulsion procedures, as we have seen before, these have not been updated to reflect the new laws.

02:05:50.386 --> 02:05:53.489
So those would need to be updated prior to the school opening.

02:05:55.928 --> 02:06:05.294
In summary, CDE staff is recommending approval based on a sound educational program, overall fiscal viability, and clarification of charter elements in the petition that are needed.

02:06:06.514 --> 02:06:14.359
The handouts that you have received also, there is the demographic chart that was included in the ACCS item.

02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:23.485
Latitude is a new school so that we don't have the demographics for them, but what I've included behind there is what was in the actual petition from the school.

02:06:24.706 --> 02:06:37.037
below that describes what in their petition they have as student demographics and they have it described there in a chart on the attachment to the demographic chart that was submitted.

02:06:37.758 --> 02:06:40.240
So if you have any questions about that I can address those as well.

02:06:40.260 --> 02:06:44.864
Okay are there any technical questions for the CDE at this time?

02:06:45.925 --> 02:06:46.646
Board Member Rucker.

02:06:48.809 --> 02:06:59.978
I just wanted to verify before we, before the commencement of this hearing, we received an updated letter that enumerated some of the changes you specified that had to be made.

02:06:59.998 --> 02:07:03.521
Have you had an opportunity to review this information that we just received?

02:07:03.581 --> 02:07:04.042
I have not.

02:07:04.342 --> 02:07:04.522
Okay.

02:07:06.969 --> 02:07:07.309
All right.

02:07:07.989 --> 02:07:10.130
With that, thank you, Lisa.

02:07:10.250 --> 02:07:12.930
And now we're ready for the public hearing to begin.

02:07:13.471 --> 02:07:21.032
Each side will have 10 minutes, and then we'll have comment, public comment from the audience, one minute for each side.

02:07:21.593 --> 02:07:30.855
So I'd like to begin with the supporters of the petition, and they also are, yeah, supporters of the petition, the Latitude Group.

02:07:33.796 --> 02:07:34.536
Okay.

02:07:34.556 --> 02:07:35.136
This is Oakland.

02:07:48.010 --> 02:07:49.031
Good morning board members.

02:07:49.651 --> 02:07:50.691
Thank you for your service.

02:07:51.312 --> 02:07:55.053
My name is Lillian Su and I'm the founding principal of Latitude High School.

02:07:55.553 --> 02:07:58.895
We are a 912 school seeking to serve the students of Oakland.

02:08:00.410 --> 02:08:04.675
Let me introduce myself, my team, and the organization supporting our team.

02:08:05.376 --> 02:08:14.948
In 2003, I was a founding teacher at Oakland Unity High School, one of the longest established charter schools in Oakland, and also one of the highest performing schools in the district.

02:08:15.749 --> 02:08:22.692
After many years at Unity, my family relocated to San Diego County, where I became a teacher and then a principal at Hitech High.

02:08:23.472 --> 02:08:29.195
As you may know, Hitech High is the only charter organization in California that has a statewide benefit charter.

02:08:29.995 --> 02:08:38.479
Every year, over 4,000 educators from around the world visit Hitech High to learn about its innovative model of high-quality project-based learning.

02:08:39.320 --> 02:08:50.735
At my specific school site, Jaitakayachula Vista, located eight miles from the U.S.-Mexico border, we were known for especially strong outcomes with college acceptance and college completion.

02:08:52.310 --> 02:09:09.136
Every year, our records, based on data from the National Clearinghouse, indicated that 82% of all of our students and 77% of our economically disadvantaged students graduated from a four-year university, compared to just 11% of students nationally.

02:09:09.816 --> 02:09:13.958
These are the kinds of outcomes that I want to see for our students in Oakland.

02:09:15.632 --> 02:09:20.055
In opening Latitude, I knew that the most important element was the founding team.

02:09:20.675 --> 02:09:28.020
Too many new schools flounder because they have big aspirations but are staffed with newer teachers who struggle to execute on that vision.

02:09:28.801 --> 02:09:36.226
Our founding team is staffed with experienced educators who have worked for years in innovative schools and in urban settings.

02:09:36.866 --> 02:09:45.867
I have personally worked alongside our math and humanities leads for five and seven years respectively, so I know the tremendous strengths that they bring.

02:09:47.475 --> 02:09:56.698
In addition, our team is backed by a CMO that has operated for 13 years in Oakland with a named focus on serving students with the greatest need.

02:09:57.819 --> 02:10:08.342
Education for Change has a reputation for outstanding finances and operations as evidenced by its clean financial audits for the last 13 years and $4.7 million in reserves.

02:10:10.990 --> 02:10:24.308
As we launch, we're also being personally mentored by the team at High Tech High and the executive director of Big Picture Learning, which is known for consistently delivering strong college and career outcomes for economically disadvantaged students.

02:10:25.854 --> 02:10:35.897
At Latitude, we will apply our team's experience with high quality project-based learning to engage students in learning experiences that use the Bay Area as our extended classroom.

02:10:36.377 --> 02:10:47.401
We will extend learning beyond the walls of a school building and demystify access to the full range of the Bay Area's assets and expand each student's sense of possibility for their future.

02:10:48.533 --> 02:10:57.537
There are no current district or charter schools in Oakland that provide the kind of place-based applied learning experiences that Latitude will provide.

02:10:58.217 --> 02:11:06.921
Too many high school students today, especially in Oakland, express that they do not know why they are learning what they're learning or how it matters to them as individuals.

02:11:07.521 --> 02:11:10.183
Students become disengaged with their schooling experiences.

02:11:10.543 --> 02:11:15.185
And as a result, over one third of all Oakland students drop out of high school.

02:11:16.025 --> 02:11:30.724
Latitude City as our extended classroom model gives students the opportunity to grapple with interdisciplinary problems through weekly field experiences outside of school, working with professionals in authentic settings to connect what they're learning to their future.

02:11:32.304 --> 02:11:37.728
To complement the real-world projects happening in our studios, our second core element is workshop.

02:11:38.269 --> 02:11:43.973
In workshop, students will have daily opportunities to engage in inquiry and student-centered discussions.

02:11:44.673 --> 02:11:55.262
Our strategies are anchored in research and personalized to meet every student where they are to ensure that students with unfinished learning or special learning needs receive the supports they need.

02:11:56.002 --> 02:12:02.163
Research has shown that personalized learning without clear competencies can lead to low rigor and expectations.

02:12:02.663 --> 02:12:10.945
At Latitude, all students will receive personalized support as they work to achieve mastery of competencies aligned to college and career readiness.

02:12:11.645 --> 02:12:16.086
Every student has an advisor who will stay with them throughout all four years of high school.

02:12:16.566 --> 02:12:21.567
Advisors support students in developing a personalized plan for how to reach their aspirations.

02:12:22.327 --> 02:12:24.269
Latitude is a gradual release model.

02:12:24.489 --> 02:12:29.974
In the earlier phases, learning experiences in the community will be scaffolded and chaperoned by teachers.

02:12:30.694 --> 02:12:40.303
As students build independence and grow their academic and professional skills, they will have increasing opportunities to engage in independent ELOs or extended learning opportunities.

02:12:42.210 --> 02:12:49.573
Our personalized approach to supporting each student with a personalized learning plan means that we are well poised to support special populations.

02:12:50.114 --> 02:12:59.558
Education for Change has developed a strong multi-tiered system of supports in collaboration with Seneca family agencies that has received national recognition.

02:13:00.238 --> 02:13:08.982
And our organization has a strong systematic approach for identifying, reclassifying, and monitoring progress of both current and former ELL students.

02:13:09.562 --> 02:13:14.685
These systems are in compliance with all state and federal guidelines, including the Every Student Succeeds Act.

02:13:19.729 --> 02:13:25.933
We have heard loud and clear from families across Oakland that they need latitude to exist.

02:13:26.553 --> 02:13:34.679
Our applicants this year came from 22 different zip codes representing 32 different middle schools across the East Bay.

02:13:35.299 --> 02:13:41.525
In every neighborhood, families have told us that they need a high-quality, innovative option like Latitude.

02:13:42.066 --> 02:13:49.734
In a city where one in three students drops out of high school, our team is determined to bring this high-quality option to the students of Oakland.

02:13:51.308 --> 02:13:59.490
We appreciate Director Constancio and her team for their thoughtful review of our charter, and we have responded in writing to four questions raised in our team's report.

02:14:00.290 --> 02:14:07.251
EFC's board has already taken action to address two of the four points, and we have clarified our stance on the remaining two questions.

02:14:07.771 --> 02:14:14.213
We are happy to take any additional steps necessary to address these issues through the MOU process if we are authorized.

02:14:14.773 --> 02:14:20.434
We've submitted our response to Director Constancio and also have provided copies for the board members today.

02:14:23.453 --> 02:14:29.919
Latitude has now received four positive recommendations for approval at district, county, and state.

02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:39.729
The OUSD Charter Review Office and the Office of the Superintendent recommended Latitude for approval on all 15 elements of the charter.

02:14:43.143 --> 02:14:51.227
Their staff highlighted our team's capacity, both in the educational program and in the area of finance and operations.

02:14:51.907 --> 02:14:59.992
Alameda County followed suit, and now the CDE staff and ACCS have concurred with back-to-back positive recommendations for approval.

02:15:00.632 --> 02:15:06.155
Our team is ready to start this school and offer Oakland students a high-quality option that they deserve.

02:15:07.116 --> 02:15:10.417
My team and I are available to answer any questions you might have.

02:15:10.917 --> 02:15:30.501
With me today as part of our team are Fabiola Harvey, our Chief Operating Officer, Kenyatta Nkonde, our Reporting Manager, Rich McNeil, our Director of Financial Strategy, Sundar Chowdhury, our Chief of Strategy, Nick Driver, our Board Chair, and of course, Hayson Thomas, our CEO.

02:15:31.341 --> 02:15:32.041
Thank you for your time.

02:15:35.128 --> 02:15:39.492
Okay, now we will have 10 minutes for the opponents to the petition.

02:15:45.598 --> 02:15:47.400
Do you have a different one?

02:15:47.540 --> 02:15:49.362
The one we have is okay?

02:15:49.422 --> 02:15:50.283
Or do you have a different one?

02:15:50.343 --> 02:15:50.583
Okay.

02:15:51.684 --> 02:15:52.545
I think it's this one.

02:15:53.526 --> 02:15:53.646
Yes.

02:16:04.673 --> 02:16:06.876
Good morning, President Kirst, members of the State Board.

02:16:07.517 --> 02:16:08.418
My name is John Yeh.

02:16:08.618 --> 02:16:11.061
I'm an attorney with the law firm of Burke, Williams & Sorensen.

02:16:11.101 --> 02:16:12.864
I represent the Oakland Unified School District.

02:16:13.525 --> 02:16:20.193
In August of this year, the OUSD Board voted 6-1 to deny the petition to form the Latitude Charter School.

02:16:21.054 --> 02:16:42.235
Among the significant concerns that the district had were the petitioners likelihood of successfully implementing the ratio and demographic break profile of the city of Oakland and the Oakland Unified School District, both in terms of African American students and also the percentage of special education students to be educated.

02:16:42.856 --> 02:16:48.559
However, those reasons are contained in the record and in the district's PowerPoint.

02:16:48.579 --> 02:16:57.403
We're going to spend most of our time today hearing from district elected officials and staff about the significant opposition to this charter petition throughout the petition process.

02:16:57.463 --> 02:17:09.990
You have in your record letters in opposition to the petition from former county superintendent of the schools Sheila Jordan, state assembly person Rob Bonta, and state senator Nancy Skinner.

02:17:10.430 --> 02:17:24.861
Today, you'll be hearing from District Director of Instruction, High School Network, Paul Koh, the district's board president, Amy Eng, and a district board member, Shanti Gonzalez, and the district student board member, Hema Quetzel.

02:17:25.301 --> 02:17:27.143
So I will hand it over now to Mr. Koh.

02:17:29.805 --> 02:17:30.946
Good morning, state board members.

02:17:30.986 --> 02:17:40.152
My name is Paul Koh, and I'm one of the executive directors for the high school network within our district, and I'm here to oppose the appeal by Education for Change Public Schools to propose Latitude High School.

02:17:41.973 --> 02:17:47.177
We don't believe that Latitude High School will encourage or enact the spirit of innovation noted in the Charter School Act.

02:17:47.697 --> 02:17:53.102
More importantly, the proposal will not provide expanded choices for parents and peoples in our Oakland system of schools.

02:17:53.723 --> 02:18:04.953
First, the proposal of latitude will negatively impact the enrollment of our schools and also the enrollment of other expanding charter schools while creating a redundant program within our city with similar schools.

02:18:05.474 --> 02:18:08.377
First school is MetWest, which is an Oakland unified school district

02:18:09.158 --> 02:18:21.276
Program and also lodestar and Oakland Unified Authorized Charter They both are influencers of latitudes proposed program and they're both set to expand in the coming two school years Fremont High School

02:18:22.165 --> 02:18:32.792
It's an Oakland Unified School District that has a student population with a majority of students who are Latino, African American, English learners, and recent immigrants in the neighborhood where Latitude is proposed to open.

02:18:33.312 --> 02:18:46.181
The school has been in a turnaround process and with an $80 million modernization construction already underway and key programmatic shifts, Fremont High School is continuing to rebuild its foundation to serve one of the most underserved communities in Oakland.

02:18:46.901 --> 02:18:50.504
The opening of Latitude has the potential to negatively impact Fremont's full turnaround.

02:18:51.044 --> 02:19:01.150
For SBAC results, there's a handout I provided for you on the back that will show that as a system, it does not show that it will outperform both either MetWest or Lodestar in SBAC proficiency.

02:19:01.771 --> 02:19:06.574
And also, another concern of ours is that the EFC public schools has not shown a commitment

02:19:06.914 --> 02:19:13.538
to increase enrollment of students with disabilities or students who are African-American, two of our most underserved student groups in Oakland.

02:19:13.998 --> 02:19:16.260
With this context, I leave you all with a question.

02:19:16.660 --> 02:19:22.644
How does the approval of Latitude's position support school innovation and better options for schools in Oakland?

02:19:25.063 --> 02:19:27.746
Good afternoon, President Kirst, members of the board.

02:19:27.786 --> 02:19:28.828
My name is Amy Ng.

02:19:28.888 --> 02:19:30.950
I'm the president of the Oakland Unified School District.

02:19:31.451 --> 02:19:34.455
I'm here to speak in opposition of the matter before you.

02:19:34.955 --> 02:19:39.061
You also have two letters from other board members who were not able to make it.

02:19:39.401 --> 02:19:43.727
At least two other members wrote letters, I believe, Director Sen and Director London.

02:19:44.948 --> 02:19:57.396
I'm here to talk about, in addition to the five reasons that are outlined in some of the letters about reasons for the appeal, excuse me, reasons to deny the appeal, I wanted to provide some local context.

02:19:58.457 --> 02:20:09.305
OUSD currently has 122 district-run and district-authorized charter schools, 87 district schools and 35 district-authorized charter schools, and around eight, I believe, county-authorized charter schools.

02:20:09.885 --> 02:20:14.471
So, we are one of the lead authorizers in the state.

02:20:14.611 --> 02:20:18.516
We're not a community that is adverse to charter schools.

02:20:18.997 --> 02:20:27.587
In fact, we've just passed a policy which speaks to district and charter schools and how we need to operate not in silos, but as a community of schools.

02:20:28.728 --> 02:20:36.091
As has been stated before by staff, we believe that we have similar programming both in district and charter schools.

02:20:37.552 --> 02:20:48.156
And we've recently also authorized the expansion of MetWest, which is an internship-based school, a big picture learning school similar to the programming that you have before you.

02:20:49.557 --> 02:21:06.352
Also, in the past year, there have been several reports released because of the district's current fiscal situation, three FCMAT reports, and also a recent grand jury report, all of which have criticized the district for having too many schools and the board for not taking tough action.

02:21:07.433 --> 02:21:11.495
We've also come under a lot of scrutiny at the county and state level because of this.

02:21:12.095 --> 02:21:16.197
The board is in the process of wanting to be proactive about our school portfolio.

02:21:16.237 --> 02:21:22.100
We started that process this year and we will be expanding and accelerating that process going forward.

02:21:22.380 --> 02:21:33.085
This is an example of a tough decision that we had to face locally because of the matters at hand, but we did make a tough decision and we hope that the state stands behind our tough decision.

02:21:33.425 --> 02:21:33.705
Thank you.

02:21:37.833 --> 02:21:39.275
Hi, members of state board.

02:21:39.455 --> 02:21:40.276
Thanks for your service.

02:21:40.917 --> 02:21:41.899
I'm Shanti Gonzalez.

02:21:42.299 --> 02:21:43.801
I serve on the OUSD board.

02:21:43.841 --> 02:21:46.085
I'm also the chair of our budget and finance committee.

02:21:47.467 --> 02:21:54.576
Over the last year and a half, we have been doing some really hard wrangling over the legacy of having as many schools as we have.

02:21:55.938 --> 02:21:57.119
and the growth of charter schools.

02:21:57.439 --> 02:22:00.222
And so I just want to share with you some of the concerns that I have.

02:22:01.663 --> 02:22:08.410
None of the charter schools in Oakland serve the same severity of needs as OUSD does.

02:22:08.830 --> 02:22:15.437
So in addition to just this distinction between the 7% and the actual 20%, not 11% as was reported in your documents,

02:22:16.338 --> 02:22:18.179
of special education students that we're serving.

02:22:18.219 --> 02:22:20.741
We're also serving students with much more severe need.

02:22:21.662 --> 02:22:26.245
So it's not simply that these are students who would not otherwise, who would not be coming to OUSD.

02:22:26.285 --> 02:22:32.089
It's also that we are being left with a higher and higher concentration of need that's not sustainable.

02:22:33.170 --> 02:22:34.772
So that's one thing I wanted to share with you.

02:22:34.852 --> 02:22:44.339
I also just wanted to share with you that EFC has struggled over the last year with the enrollment, falling short of their enrollment projections in their middle school.

02:22:45.460 --> 02:22:50.223
I believe you are going to see the same thing happen with their high school if you are to move forward.

02:22:51.344 --> 02:23:05.093
And then the last thing I would just share is that we are trying to take proactive steps in OUSD to address all of the complexity of the growth of charter schools, our need to address making some changes in our portfolio.

02:23:05.934 --> 02:23:12.098
If you continue to open new schools in OUSD, that really undermines really hard work that we are trying proactively to do.

02:23:12.558 --> 02:23:15.967
So I encourage you to turn down this appeal.

02:23:16.027 --> 02:23:16.328
Thank you.

02:23:19.645 --> 02:23:21.745
Hello, my name is Gemma Quetzal Cardenas.

02:23:21.825 --> 02:23:29.747
I'm the student director for the year of 17-18, and I've also been appointed by the governor to be next year's student board member on the State Board of Education.

02:23:30.467 --> 02:23:40.749
So during my time on the school board in Oakland, the conversations that we've been having is, what makes a good neighborhood school?

02:23:41.150 --> 02:23:43.150
Not, should we be opening more schools?

02:23:43.750 --> 02:23:52.015
As a student representing 36,000 students, the students I have voiced is that they want more investments to our schools that are innovative already.

02:23:52.556 --> 02:23:58.139
Charters are supposed to be innovative, but the program that Latitude has already presented has already been made.

02:23:58.519 --> 02:24:02.402
Fremont has already been successful in having an architecture and media academy.

02:24:02.782 --> 02:24:05.084
And MetWest has been doing the community work.

02:24:05.124 --> 02:24:09.308
They have internships, and my School Life Academy has advisories and does internships.

02:24:09.709 --> 02:24:12.892
All of these schools are in the same district that Latitude wants to come into.

02:24:13.332 --> 02:24:22.721
And so I have already said this to Latitude, that instead of trying to make more schools, bring resources to the neighboring schools around us, because we shouldn't be reinventing the wheel.

02:24:23.061 --> 02:24:25.704
We should be making our schools better across the state.

02:24:26.224 --> 02:24:36.989
So please listen to the students that have already voiced this because in Oakland our values is student first and students first means giving the needs that students need and want and have voiced repeatedly.

02:24:37.330 --> 02:24:39.711
Thank you and oppose latitude.

02:24:39.771 --> 02:24:40.031
Thank you.

02:24:50.424 --> 02:24:55.651
All right, we'll now hear public comment.

02:24:55.932 --> 02:25:03.222
So we call the list and you will have one minute each.

02:25:03.603 --> 02:25:04.524
Well, I can...

02:25:07.771 --> 02:25:09.552
Okay, I'll close it here.

02:25:11.273 --> 02:25:14.875
All right, would the first group of speakers please line up?

02:25:15.355 --> 02:25:30.784
Christian Martinez, Norma Cruz, Robin Coates, Mariah Iniguez-Williams, Reina Iniguez, Anthony Ponce, David Castillo, Lauren Krestinger, Dirk Tillerson,

02:25:33.006 --> 02:25:42.229
Jamoke Hilton-Hodge, Rachel Willis, Ramel Antoine, Shanti Gonzalez, Amy Ng, Lorraine Richards.

02:25:49.131 --> 02:25:49.412
Hello.

02:25:50.352 --> 02:25:50.932
Hello, everyone.

02:25:51.152 --> 02:25:52.372
My name is Christian Martinez.

02:25:55.339 --> 02:25:56.260
I was raised in Oakland.

02:25:56.440 --> 02:25:58.281
I dropped out twice from high school.

02:25:58.841 --> 02:26:00.703
Now I'm an educator in Oakland, California.

02:26:01.083 --> 02:26:05.706
And I have nephews that currently attend charter schools and district schools in Oakland.

02:26:07.087 --> 02:26:24.038
There's a loud charter voice growing in Oakland, which is frustrating because as a Latino man, raising nephews and family members in the flatlands of Oakland, it's just really difficult, knowing that potentially there's about

02:26:25.723 --> 02:26:28.367
One out of three students still dropping out of high school.

02:26:29.768 --> 02:26:32.892
People who are trying to oppose a new high school who brings innovation.

02:26:33.213 --> 02:26:34.654
It's just a privilege.

02:26:35.095 --> 02:26:36.437
It's a privilege that they have.

02:26:36.717 --> 02:26:39.961
My family, friends, and community members just don't have.

02:26:40.301 --> 02:26:42.104
In neighborhoods, the dropout rate is 50%.

02:26:43.445 --> 02:26:48.348
our neighborhood, high school, and only 3% of the 11th graders are tested proficient in math.

02:26:48.728 --> 02:26:50.029
3%, you wouldn't send your students there.

02:26:50.670 --> 02:26:55.473
But there are those in Oakland who want to send my students there, who want my nephew to go there.

02:26:55.713 --> 02:26:56.333
And I say no.

02:26:56.673 --> 02:27:01.416
I want something that is innovative for them, and they are able to have a better future.

02:27:01.736 --> 02:27:02.017
Thank you.

02:27:02.057 --> 02:27:02.817
Please approve what I have to do.

02:27:06.559 --> 02:27:07.160
Good afternoon.

02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:08.961
My name is Robin Coates.

02:27:09.001 --> 02:27:12.163
I'm the Director of College Advising at High Tech High Chula Vista in San Diego County.

02:27:12.948 --> 02:27:15.869
I'm here in support of Lillian Soo, John Bosselman, and Latitude High School.

02:27:16.489 --> 02:27:23.950
I've worked closely with Lillian and John for six years, and I can think of no better team to start a school with the goal of getting students to and through a four-year university.

02:27:24.611 --> 02:27:36.033
The school where Lillian, John, and I work together has a population of students where over 55% were recipients of free or reduced-price lunch, 60% were first-generation college-going, and over 80% were students of color.

02:27:36.874 --> 02:27:41.215
During Lillian's five-year tenure as director, 99% of our students completed their A through G requirements.

02:27:41.595 --> 02:27:49.417
And as a result, the percentage of students accepted to at least one four-year university jumped from 62% her first year to over 80% her final year.

02:27:50.477 --> 02:27:54.818
Four out of five of those students, 82%, then went on to graduate from college.

02:27:55.319 --> 02:28:00.580
More impressively, 77% of our economically disadvantaged students went on to graduate from a four-year university.

02:28:01.500 --> 02:28:04.661
Based on their track record of success, I have no doubt in my mind that Lillian and John

02:28:05.148 --> 02:28:08.350
will continue to provide outstanding outcomes for their first-generation students of color.

02:28:09.190 --> 02:28:14.854
I humbly request to improve Latitude High School so Oakland's families have the same type of access to higher education.

02:28:15.334 --> 02:28:15.934
Thank you for your time.

02:28:21.317 --> 02:28:22.978
Hello, good morning, good afternoon, board.

02:28:23.439 --> 02:28:24.519
My name is David Castillo.

02:28:25.160 --> 02:28:27.561
I'm an educator and a public school parent in East Oakland.

02:28:29.562 --> 02:28:32.684
I have led schools in East Oakland for the past 10 years.

02:28:36.175 --> 02:28:43.421
There is no school team that is more capable of defying the dismal results for black and brown youth in Oakland than this Latitude team.

02:28:44.301 --> 02:28:45.762
I've worked closely with Lillian Sue.

02:28:45.902 --> 02:28:48.364
I founded Oakland Unity High School with her in 2003.

02:28:48.965 --> 02:28:54.929
I've worked closely with Education for Change and can attest to their ability to operationalize this inspiring and innovative model.

02:28:57.111 --> 02:28:59.313
Two years ago, this charter petition would have been approved locally.

02:28:59.693 --> 02:29:05.818
Today in Oakland, charters are being scapegoated and blamed for decades of poor district fiscal oversight and management challenges.

02:29:07.025 --> 02:29:13.071
This has all been well documented by the Grand Jury of Alameda County and the Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team.

02:29:14.733 --> 02:29:19.878
What we're looking at here are four different authorizing bodies that have recommended this charter for approval.

02:29:20.579 --> 02:29:25.764
Both the district and the county failed to live up to those recommendations.

02:29:25.804 --> 02:29:29.447
You have an opportunity here to do something that's very important for the children of Oakland.

02:29:29.608 --> 02:29:30.729
Thank you very much for your support.

02:29:36.488 --> 02:29:36.748
Hi.

02:29:37.529 --> 02:29:38.730
Hi, good morning board members.

02:29:38.770 --> 02:29:45.336
My name is Anthony Ponce and I'm a rising ninth grader who is representing the 100 and other 30 applicants for Latitude.

02:29:46.117 --> 02:29:50.761
I worked on Latitude since last August when I took part of their summer pilot program.

02:29:51.422 --> 02:29:53.383
And since then I have been to every board meeting.

02:29:54.645 --> 02:29:56.727
And I've also helped co-design the school.

02:29:57.647 --> 02:30:04.292
This school gives an opportunity for education that is not offered by many others, if not any school.

02:30:04.952 --> 02:30:13.878
And we have the professionals properly armed with this knowledge to help the students with the things they need.

02:30:15.379 --> 02:30:21.623
And I have tried to apply to other schools that have these forms, but they have very little to no cases in them.

02:30:22.784 --> 02:30:24.345
Thank you and please vote to approve Latitude.

02:30:30.146 --> 02:30:31.527
Hi, my name is Dirk Tillotson.

02:30:31.567 --> 02:30:33.409
I'm a board member at Education for Change.

02:30:33.429 --> 02:30:34.350
I'm also an attorney.

02:30:34.410 --> 02:30:38.754
I've worked for 25 years in education reform in Oakland, New York, New Orleans, and elsewhere.

02:30:40.015 --> 02:30:44.339
Strong team, strong design, strong finances, strong background organization.

02:30:44.359 --> 02:30:52.046
I must say, also, with Director Henry Hodge, I founded the State of Black Education in Oakland, really focusing on black kids and the challenges we face.

02:30:52.847 --> 02:30:54.828
And it's a little strange to hear the board

02:30:56.036 --> 02:31:04.306
say that the black kids are the issue that Spring brought up, where we've never heard anything except cuts to the Office of Equity recently around serving black kids.

02:31:05.087 --> 02:31:10.352
And now, because Ed for Change has a few less black kids, it's a reason to deny this school.

02:31:12.134 --> 02:31:13.796
Everybody has work to do in that regard.

02:31:14.645 --> 02:31:16.366
This is a school that can make a difference.

02:31:16.406 --> 02:31:18.588
These students have one chance at high school.

02:31:18.688 --> 02:31:21.731
If you have kids of your own, as I do, they have one chance.

02:31:22.031 --> 02:31:24.193
They can't wait for the district to get it right.

02:31:24.553 --> 02:31:26.455
The district has had plenty of chance to get it right.

02:31:26.735 --> 02:31:27.676
They're saying no new schools.

02:31:27.736 --> 02:31:31.599
If you read the grand jury, they approved two new schools without even budgeting for those schools last year.

02:31:31.639 --> 02:31:31.839
Time.

02:31:38.427 --> 02:31:39.007
Hello board.

02:31:39.127 --> 02:31:40.008
My name is Mariah.

02:31:40.228 --> 02:31:41.428
I am an EFC student.

02:31:42.029 --> 02:31:47.071
I am here to open Latitude because it allows me to get out of my comfort zone and explore the city I live in.

02:31:47.631 --> 02:31:53.473
Me along with other future students will have many opportunities to work with professionals.

02:31:54.154 --> 02:31:57.895
In the area of Oakland where I live the high schools aren't as high quality as I would hope.

02:31:58.616 --> 02:32:00.717
That's why I'm trying so hard to get the school open.

02:32:01.037 --> 02:32:05.819
I'm not sure what I want to do for my life but I know that going here can help me decide a path that I might be interested in.

02:32:06.719 --> 02:32:09.102
I am the face of the students who want to go to this school.

02:32:09.583 --> 02:32:12.847
There are too many adults making decisions that impact me and my friends.

02:32:13.148 --> 02:32:14.409
My community wants this school.

02:32:14.910 --> 02:32:16.172
Please vote to approve latitude.

02:32:21.158 --> 02:32:21.599
Hello board.

02:32:22.420 --> 02:32:23.481
My name is Raina Iniguez.

02:32:24.201 --> 02:32:26.262
and I'm a proud parent of an EFC middle school student.

02:32:26.482 --> 02:32:29.824
We are a founding family, and my daughter is part of the student latitude design team.

02:32:30.745 --> 02:32:33.186
I'm here to express a need for a school like this in my community.

02:32:33.446 --> 02:32:41.931
In Oakland, less than 65% of students are graduated, and only 39% African-American graduates completed requirements needed to apply to a UC or CSU.

02:32:42.631 --> 02:32:47.034
As you can see, I have an African-American daughter, and this is not acceptable for us.

02:32:47.794 --> 02:32:52.055
I ask that you approve Latitude because I see that it will provide my daughter with real life work experiences.

02:32:52.875 --> 02:32:59.477
And I know that EFC will continue to provide both, excuse me, provide her both educational and her health needs as they do today.

02:32:59.817 --> 02:33:02.318
Thank you for your consistent consideration for our students of Oakland.

02:33:11.721 --> 02:33:12.141
Good morning.

02:33:12.481 --> 02:33:16.902
She will be reading her testimony in Spanish and I'll be afterwards translating for her.

02:33:19.864 --> 02:33:20.645
Buenos dias.

02:33:20.825 --> 02:33:23.688
Mi nombre es Norma Garcia.

02:33:24.588 --> 02:33:30.313
Y tengo dos hijos y vivo en el area de Oakland.

02:33:31.795 --> 02:33:38.100
Soy madre que lucho por la educación de alta calidad que mis hijos y todo estudiante merece.

02:33:38.681 --> 02:33:43.285
Como madres buscamos verdaderas oportunidades.

02:33:44.571 --> 02:33:50.773
para el futuro de nuestros hijos y desafortunadamente en el área no los tenemos.

02:33:51.614 --> 02:33:55.455
No todas las escuelas de nuestra comunidad las ofrecen.

02:33:55.895 --> 02:34:05.399
No podemos poner en pausa la educación de nuestros hijos o a esperar algunos años mientras las escuelas a nuestro alrededor mejoran.

02:34:06.837 --> 02:34:19.821
Tengo a mis hijos en la escuela de EFC porque busco un modelo de educación y empuje a el desafío en pensar más allá de las preparatoria.

02:34:20.421 --> 02:34:27.964
Que la latitud es paso necesario para ellos alcanzar y graduarse de la universidad.

02:34:28.524 --> 02:34:46.364
creo que hay una comunidad detrás de la actitud equipada en maestros entusiasmados en proveer a nuestros hijos las herramientas que hacen falta que hacen falta en nuestra comunidad quienes los preparen para enfrentar cada paso

02:34:46.884 --> 02:34:57.617
con seguridad y lo vean como estudiantes talentosos capazes de hacer lo que se propongan y no solo ser vistos como un numero monetario.

02:34:58.197 --> 02:35:01.261
Les pido aprueben a latitude por favor.

02:35:01.461 --> 02:35:02.282
Muchas gracias.

02:35:07.446 --> 02:35:09.788
My name is Norma Garcia and I'm a mother of two sons.

02:35:10.408 --> 02:35:16.974
I live in the Fruitville community and I'm here representing the families who are, for quality of education, our children deserve.

02:35:17.974 --> 02:35:23.159
We seek real opportunities for our children and unfortunately not all the schools in our community are able to provide that.

02:35:23.739 --> 02:35:31.065
I currently have my children in the EFC community because I'm looking for a school community that would motivate, push, and challenge them to think beyond high school.

02:35:31.765 --> 02:35:37.369
I believe that Latitude is the next step for my children in reaching the possibility of getting to and graduating from college.

02:35:38.030 --> 02:35:54.682
I believe the community behind Latitude is equipped with a passionate team who can provide every challenge, can provide every children with the tools that our community lacks and who will prepare them to take every challenge with confidence and who see our children as talented and capable individuals and not just as a dollar sign.

02:35:55.463 --> 02:36:00.867
I urge that you consider approving Latitude and see this as an opportunity that our community needs for our children.

02:36:01.127 --> 02:36:01.447
Thank you.

02:36:10.493 --> 02:36:12.014
Good afternoon, president and board.

02:36:12.034 --> 02:36:13.535
My name is Lauren Kretzinger.

02:36:13.575 --> 02:36:16.637
I'm a regional executive director at Seneca Family of Agencies.

02:36:17.157 --> 02:36:25.503
We provide mental health, special education, and school climate and culture services in about 100 schools, districts, and charters.

02:36:25.883 --> 02:36:28.605
We've been working with EFC for about 10 years now.

02:36:29.265 --> 02:36:37.911
We haven't seen anyone more committed than EFC in working with every student to provide all necessary services to be successful.

02:36:38.631 --> 02:36:50.759
Our perspective is that EFC is the strongest special education provider providing diverse and inclusive services to the students and families as they need them both in their schools and in their communities.

02:36:51.099 --> 02:36:51.359
Thank you.

02:36:56.789 --> 02:36:59.190
Lorraine Richards, California Teachers Association.

02:36:59.750 --> 02:37:10.255
CTA strongly opposes the overturning of the decision of the local and county district that all well-reasoned and best understand the needs of the students and of the local area.

02:37:10.915 --> 02:37:15.117
The petitioner actually asked for a material change on the appeal.

02:37:15.637 --> 02:37:18.718
The state board is without jurisdiction to hear that repeal.

02:37:19.418 --> 02:37:25.401
And the petitioner wishing to continue, the petitioner must return to the local and county school board.

02:37:26.281 --> 02:37:37.691
Another piece is that the petitioner does not meet the intent of the Charter School Act to expand educational offerings or encourage different and innovative teaching methods.

02:37:38.812 --> 02:37:42.075
It was also stated that it's a duplication of program.

02:37:42.775 --> 02:37:50.562
There is a disabilities piece that is not being met and African-American population is also not being met.

02:37:51.162 --> 02:37:55.028
How is this educational program providing to a diverse community?

02:37:55.509 --> 02:37:59.695
Please consider a opposed position to continuing this.

02:37:59.835 --> 02:38:00.096
Thank you.

02:38:05.424 --> 02:38:06.625
Good afternoon, board.

02:38:07.225 --> 02:38:09.726
Ramel Antoine with the California Charter Schools Association.

02:38:09.746 --> 02:38:11.487
Wanted to talk about a couple of things.

02:38:11.527 --> 02:38:14.769
The first one is about continuation of, or a continuum of learning.

02:38:14.829 --> 02:38:21.933
So we know that EFC is currently operating schools in the Oakland area, all that were conversion schools serving their neighborhood boundaries.

02:38:22.733 --> 02:38:33.559
And then clearly there's a need, sort of a natural need of progression for these students to be able to matriculate into a high school where they can achieve better outcomes than are currently being realized by students in the community.

02:38:34.079 --> 02:38:37.643
And so it's really important that this school be allowed to exist.

02:38:37.723 --> 02:38:50.775
I think also it's important to consider the small impact, really, of a small opening class of about 50 students that are largely going to be coming from the community in which they're serving and going up to 320 over time.

02:38:53.518 --> 02:39:00.966
You know, the charter law is clear that there are clear reasons for denial, and they haven't met that at any point in any staff findings, really.

02:39:01.867 --> 02:39:06.031
And so, I urge you to adopt CDE's recommendation and ACCS's.

02:39:06.272 --> 02:39:06.532
Thank you.

02:39:11.209 --> 02:39:11.950
Good afternoon.

02:39:12.230 --> 02:39:17.133
My name is Jamoke Hinton-Hodge, and I actually have the privilege to sit on the advisory commission here.

02:39:17.173 --> 02:39:25.639
I had to recuse myself because I also sit on Oakland Unified School District as a board member, currently serving as the vice president.

02:39:26.480 --> 02:39:30.403
So it might seem a bit awkward or out of place that I'm actually here.

02:39:31.264 --> 02:39:33.826
And I lean into uncomfort sometimes.

02:39:34.526 --> 02:39:35.747
I am the dissenting vote.

02:39:36.008 --> 02:39:39.971
I am the one vote that voted for latitude.

02:39:40.491 --> 02:39:45.675
And so I wanted to kind of show my support to say where that dissent for me came from.

02:39:46.336 --> 02:39:51.099
And that as a democratic space, sometimes we are allowed that opportunity to express that.

02:39:51.159 --> 02:39:54.202
So it is with no disrespect for the process at all.

02:39:54.742 --> 02:40:01.448
And so for me, it's very important to note that all of the staff reports said favorable about the school.

02:40:01.848 --> 02:40:05.831
When you look at the design, it is very clear that we have nothing that replicates it.

02:40:05.891 --> 02:40:07.372
MetWest is an amazing school.

02:40:07.773 --> 02:40:12.737
So why is it that MetWest's CEO is actually mentoring this school?

02:40:13.197 --> 02:40:15.939
So that it can move to the next level and go beyond.

02:40:16.400 --> 02:40:18.681
It doesn't impact us financially or fiscally.

02:40:18.842 --> 02:40:20.263
That report was done as well.

02:40:20.943 --> 02:40:29.128
This is a slippery slope I think we are on if we are not going to honor time our educators who have made recommendations.

02:40:29.188 --> 02:40:29.488
Thank you.

02:40:34.056 --> 02:40:35.677
Hello again, I'm Shanti Gonzalez.

02:40:35.777 --> 02:40:37.539
I also serve on the OUSD board.

02:40:37.599 --> 02:40:41.222
I just wanted to share a couple things that are really positive that are happening in OUSD.

02:40:42.603 --> 02:40:46.747
One thing somebody said is that you have an important opportunity here today, and that's true.

02:40:47.087 --> 02:40:52.632
You can help us to build on the success we're having in our graduation rates, which are up 7% over the last six years.

02:40:53.172 --> 02:40:57.436
You can help us build on our increasing reading and math scores, which are also up.

02:40:57.897 --> 02:41:00.820
I'm not going to tell you that we're where we want to be or where we need to be.

02:41:01.360 --> 02:41:02.541
Our students deserve the best.

02:41:03.382 --> 02:41:14.493
You have an opportunity here today to help us build on that success and not continue to introduce new shocks to the system that we are already reeling from, frankly, the growth of charter schools.

02:41:15.614 --> 02:41:19.117
and, you know, financial issues that are long, have needed to be addressed for a long time.

02:41:19.977 --> 02:41:25.101
I'm proud of the work I'm doing on the Budget and Finance Committee and several other people are doing on the Budget and Finance Committee.

02:41:25.562 --> 02:41:30.946
I'm proud that we're trying to come together and grapple with these decisions that have needed to be grappled with for a long time.

02:41:31.146 --> 02:41:33.649
And I really urge you to give us the space to do that work.

02:41:34.189 --> 02:41:34.809
It is hard work.

02:41:34.870 --> 02:41:36.231
It's politically very hard.

02:41:36.831 --> 02:41:37.392
It takes time.

02:41:37.532 --> 02:41:37.812
Thank you.

02:41:38.567 --> 02:41:52.015
Yeah, before you call the next list, I wanted to announce to the board members that the lunches are ready in the antiway and board members will exit, not all at once, periodically to pick up their lunches.

02:41:52.976 --> 02:41:53.296
Go ahead.

02:41:53.902 --> 02:41:55.583
With the next group of speakers, please line up.

02:41:55.723 --> 02:42:18.535
Keith Braun, Vida Mendoza, Renee Swain, Juan Matiar, Bethany Meyer, Anne Swanburn, Emily Folloy, David Weintraub, Joe Bates, Ona Keller, Shelly Weintraub, Kampala Tyse Rossifer, John Sheehan, Frasier Bradshaw, Liz Ortega, Esai Talib.

02:42:25.831 --> 02:42:26.531
Good afternoon.

02:42:26.891 --> 02:42:28.071
My name is Keith Brown.

02:42:28.171 --> 02:42:35.773
I'm a 19-year teacher in OUSD, and I'm also the president of the Oakland Education Association.

02:42:36.593 --> 02:42:49.755
One of the many reasons you should reject this petition is because Education for Change has historically failed to serve a student body that achieves a racial and ethnic balance reflective of Oakland.

02:42:50.096 --> 02:42:52.236
It will continue to do so at latitude.

02:42:52.796 --> 02:43:02.118
Specifically, EFC doesn't enroll African-Americans at rates anywhere comparable to OUSD or nearby district schools.

02:43:02.738 --> 02:43:17.262
In 17-18, black students only made up 9% of the student body in Education for Change's six schools, in contrast to 24% of the district-wide schools and 21% at nearby Fremont High School.

02:43:17.782 --> 02:43:26.910
Don't believe EFC's attempt to explain their low enrollment of black students away by saying that their schools have neighborhood attendance boundaries.

02:43:27.450 --> 02:43:38.000
Any OUSD schools in the same neighborhood have higher enrollment of black students and EFC's two start-up schools also serve black students well below the district and nearby schools.

02:43:38.840 --> 02:43:39.181
Thank you.

02:43:39.221 --> 02:43:40.702
Please reject this petition.

02:43:46.499 --> 02:43:47.099
Good afternoon.

02:43:47.119 --> 02:43:48.220
My name is Bethany Meyer.

02:43:48.260 --> 02:43:52.163
I'm a special education teacher and parent in Oakland.

02:43:52.223 --> 02:43:55.486
I had a chance to read the petition claim and EFC's response.

02:43:55.566 --> 02:43:56.887
And I'm going to be frank with you.

02:43:56.927 --> 02:44:02.591
I found it really offensive as a parent and a special education teacher.

02:44:03.312 --> 02:44:07.515
Most of the information that's included here is not relevant to the petition claim.

02:44:08.375 --> 02:44:13.499
They should be proud of their robust MTSS model, but that is not special education.

02:44:14.760 --> 02:44:24.332
And there's no information included here on the percentage of moderate severe students they serve, which makes me think it must not be very money or it's none at all.

02:44:25.554 --> 02:44:32.262
So as you've been told, we're currently serving about 20% special education students and they're serving

02:44:34.003 --> 02:44:37.285
7, 8% of students with lower needs.

02:44:37.826 --> 02:44:48.632
So until they start serving students who are deaf, blind, have feeding tubes, need orientation and mobility or nursing services, I cannot take this very seriously.

02:44:48.692 --> 02:44:50.933
We're proud of the services that we provide.

02:44:51.373 --> 02:44:51.753
Thank you.

02:44:51.794 --> 02:44:52.514
Please reject this.

02:44:57.705 --> 02:44:58.445
Good afternoon.

02:44:59.326 --> 02:45:00.527
My name is Emily Folloy.

02:45:00.587 --> 02:45:08.711
I'm an Oakland resident, a retired ELD teacher in Oakland, and a parent of two OUSD graduates.

02:45:09.651 --> 02:45:11.753
I want to speak about this process.

02:45:13.113 --> 02:45:16.115
And I'm asking you to deny the latitude petition.

02:45:16.475 --> 02:45:18.036
I'd like to speak about the process.

02:45:18.456 --> 02:45:23.039
Our coalition of community, teacher, students, and labor

02:45:23.619 --> 02:45:36.707
emailed all of you on the board asking to meet to discuss these very complex issues through a phone conversation, video, or in person if that could be arranged.

02:45:37.488 --> 02:45:40.169
Nearly all of you refused to meet with us.

02:45:40.890 --> 02:45:42.150
You are a public body.

02:45:43.271 --> 02:45:52.956
And the public deserves more access to you than having to drive to Sacramento and speak in one-minute increments during public comment.

02:45:54.577 --> 02:46:02.201
We know that you make yourselves available to the charter industry, and yet you have refused to meet with us.

02:46:03.401 --> 02:46:04.642
Our schools belong...

02:46:19.090 --> 02:46:19.530
Thank you.

02:46:19.890 --> 02:46:32.232
My name is David Weintraub and I am a parent with the Oakland Unified School District, former student and civil rights activist for the last 40 years or so.

02:46:32.252 --> 02:46:39.834
We're concerned about the proliferation of charters in Oakland and the undermining of our public education system.

02:46:40.694 --> 02:46:47.795
We are asking that you uphold the decisions of the Alameda County Board of Education and Oakland Unified School District

02:46:48.655 --> 02:46:59.079
I was asked by Senator Nancy Skinner, who is our representative, to provide you each with a copy of the letter she sent on June 28th, which has now been provided to you.

02:46:59.619 --> 02:47:07.201
In sum, she says that there are three of many important reasons to oppose the application of latitude.

02:47:07.641 --> 02:47:10.062
The local boards are more knowledgeable.

02:47:10.642 --> 02:47:12.643
Please respect local control.

02:47:13.864 --> 02:47:22.229
And there is a new report in the public interest, which says that Oakland is spending over $57 million per year.

02:47:23.250 --> 02:47:31.535
And furthermore, on charters and because of charters, and furthermore, the district is struggling and needs to stay solvent.

02:47:31.915 --> 02:47:37.018
So every additional charter is a problem in that direction, causing a vicious cycle.

02:47:37.278 --> 02:47:37.638
Thank you.

02:47:37.678 --> 02:47:40.420
Please oppose the application.

02:47:45.646 --> 02:47:46.927
Good afternoon board members.

02:47:47.807 --> 02:47:48.908
My name is Jo Bates.

02:47:49.729 --> 02:47:55.452
I am a parent of OUSD graduates and I am also a product of the Okanogan High School District.

02:47:56.393 --> 02:47:59.575
I stand in opposition of the petition that's before you.

02:48:00.965 --> 02:48:12.751
Based on its financial and enrollment track record, especially with start-up schools, it is clear that EFC is demonstratively unlikely to successfully implement the program as set forth in the petition.

02:48:13.431 --> 02:48:19.554
During the 2017-18 school year, none of EFC's schools met their projected enrollment.

02:48:20.234 --> 02:48:24.718
EPIC, its newest school, was 82 students below its projected enrollment.

02:48:25.338 --> 02:48:36.227
At EFC Startups, Achieve Academy, and EPIC, enrollment for 2018-19 is a combined 46 students below budgeted projections.

02:48:36.668 --> 02:48:44.294
These continual declines in enrollment have a negative impact on EFC's finances, creating an operating loss over three times greater than planned.

02:48:44.674 --> 02:48:47.877
The number clearly shows that EFC is struggling with the lack of community

02:48:48.377 --> 02:48:51.859
I thank you very much for your time, and again, I stand in opposition of this petition.

02:48:51.919 --> 02:48:52.299
Thank you.

02:48:58.181 --> 02:48:59.482
Good afternoon, board members.

02:48:59.582 --> 02:49:08.666
My name is Liz Ortega, and I'm here representing the Alameda Labor Council that represents 135,000 members and workers in Alameda County.

02:49:08.686 --> 02:49:17.250
I'm also a very proud graduate of Fremont High School and a product of the Oakland Public Unified School District.

02:49:18.390 --> 02:49:30.657
Today, I'm here to join a broad coalition of Oakland Unified School District students, parents, school board members, unions, and community-based organizations that have opposed this petition from day one.

02:49:31.157 --> 02:49:36.080
Today, I have 2,500 signatures opposing this charter school.

02:49:36.940 --> 02:49:52.035
Working families in Oakland need strong and stable schools and the educators, the students and the families at Oakland Unified School District are doing the hard work and to make sure that every single student gets the school they deserve and they need.

02:49:52.813 --> 02:49:59.917
The Oakland Unified School Board and the Alameda County Board made the right decision to reject this petition.

02:49:59.937 --> 02:50:03.218
And they know best what is best for Oakland kids.

02:50:04.279 --> 02:50:11.783
I urge you to reject this petition and listen to the 2,500 members of the community who signed these petitions.

02:50:11.883 --> 02:50:12.243
Thank you.

02:50:19.793 --> 02:50:21.194
Good afternoon, board members.

02:50:22.254 --> 02:50:23.734
My name is Shelly Weintraub.

02:50:24.154 --> 02:50:29.856
I was a teacher and an administrator in OUSD for almost 35 years.

02:50:30.456 --> 02:50:32.517
I urge you to reject this petition.

02:50:33.017 --> 02:50:36.278
And I'm here because Assemblymember Bonta

02:50:36.878 --> 02:51:05.774
asked us to give his, you saw it in your packet, several of these issues have come up, but as an assembly member for the district that represents Latitude, he is opposed to it for the reasons that were stated, because they are demonstratively unable to keep their promise about enrollment, given Epic is a feeder school to Latitude, because they don't represent the diversity of Oakland's student body, particularly African-American and special ed.

02:51:06.534 --> 02:51:17.584
and he asks you to pay attention to the local board and to the local Alameda County board and to have respect for the elected bodies in our district.

02:51:17.724 --> 02:51:18.065
Thank you.

02:51:23.715 --> 02:51:24.316
Good afternoon.

02:51:24.516 --> 02:51:26.337
My name is Compalites Rancifer.

02:51:27.278 --> 02:51:30.281
I have two children attending school in Oakland.

02:51:30.901 --> 02:51:40.309
My son, educated in OUSD schools K through 12, is a proud graduate who just finished his first year of college.

02:51:41.410 --> 02:51:43.512
I live and teach in East Oakland.

02:51:44.292 --> 02:51:46.514
The argument that Latitude is making is deceptive.

02:51:47.795 --> 02:52:01.004
In order to prove that it can provide an educationally sound program, EFC has referenced the track record of High Tech High, Chula Vista, where many Latitudes founding staff have previously worked.

02:52:02.285 --> 02:52:11.652
What EFC fails to mention is that High Tech High educates a significantly different population than OUSD and existing EFC schools.

02:52:12.984 --> 02:52:21.673
For example, EFC schools serve almost twice as many students eligible for free and reduced priced meals as high tech high.

02:52:24.375 --> 02:52:28.139
Only 6.9% of high tech high students are English language learners.

02:52:29.901 --> 02:52:30.561
Did you say time?

02:52:30.762 --> 02:52:33.064
Yeah.

02:52:33.705 --> 02:52:37.028
OK, well, I would urge you to reject this petition.

02:52:42.639 --> 02:52:43.299
Good afternoon.

02:52:43.359 --> 02:52:44.420
My name's Fred Bradshaw.

02:52:44.760 --> 02:52:47.841
I'm a parent of a Oakland public school student.

02:52:49.401 --> 02:52:54.783
What I hear today is political maneuvering from the opposition to latitude.

02:52:55.803 --> 02:53:00.505
This body, this board exists for the betterment of California's youth.

02:53:01.145 --> 02:53:08.988
And I encourage you all to put politics and maneuvering aside and do what is best for the students of California.

02:53:09.328 --> 02:53:09.908
Thank you very much.

02:53:15.811 --> 02:53:17.213
Hi, my name is Ann Swinburne.

02:53:17.253 --> 02:53:19.536
I'm an OUSD parent and I work with CTA.

02:53:19.937 --> 02:53:22.540
I wanted to talk about this question of material revision.

02:53:22.560 --> 02:53:32.494
Your staff has repeatedly said that the material revision for the change of the school year was included in the cover letter.

02:53:33.075 --> 02:53:33.856
with the petition.

02:53:35.116 --> 02:53:36.857
This is the cover letter of the petition.

02:53:36.957 --> 02:53:39.379
It doesn't mention the material revision in it at all.

02:53:39.559 --> 02:53:54.708
What it does mention is the description of any changes to the petition necessary to reflect the SBE as the chartering entity, which is a requirement under the Charter Schools Act that an amendment is added to the petition that reflects the SBE as the chartering entity.

02:53:55.148 --> 02:53:55.989
That letter is here.

02:53:56.849 --> 02:54:00.032
That letter is where the material revision is made.

02:54:00.132 --> 02:54:05.296
The charter term is changed from a 2018 open to a 2019 open.

02:54:05.717 --> 02:54:07.518
This is an amendment to the petition.

02:54:07.598 --> 02:54:15.766
It changed the petition and the CDE staff was out of line in accepting the petition from Education for Change.

02:54:15.806 --> 02:54:20.970
They should have sent them back and had them resubmit a petition that did not contain a material revision.

02:54:21.390 --> 02:54:21.751
Thank you.

02:54:27.459 --> 02:54:29.300
Ona Keller, California Teachers Association.

02:54:29.340 --> 02:54:32.142
I just wanted to continue on talking about the material changes.

02:54:32.622 --> 02:54:38.565
In tab 12 of the petition that the petitioner submitted, it was on page 2426.

02:54:39.566 --> 02:54:48.551
They actually add 81 extra pages about financial updates and projections based on changes to the start date.

02:54:49.271 --> 02:54:50.632
They clearly say that they want to start in 2019-2020.

02:54:52.213 --> 02:55:01.264
They say it in a number of places, including in the actual budget documents, in which they say the planning year is 17-18, the prototype year is 18-19, and that year one is 19-20.

02:55:01.464 --> 02:55:05.249
In that prototype year, the enrollment is listed as zero.

02:55:06.030 --> 02:55:07.892
That is a complete material change.

02:55:08.152 --> 02:55:09.174
I don't have to tell you that.

02:55:09.214 --> 02:55:11.617
You're already in litigation about it from a different school district.

02:55:12.618 --> 02:55:28.229
So there's further evidence of these material changes in the letter that comes before all these new budget documents, which include that they had to revise down their unduplicated count because they're not having as many students qualify for LCFF funding.

02:55:28.570 --> 02:55:34.915
We anticipate that with an additional year to build relationships across the city, we'll be even better positioned to help students in Oakland.

02:55:35.155 --> 02:55:40.379
And that in their facilities, they specifically say that Epic Middle School is to house the program for the first year in 2019-2020.

02:55:41.960 --> 02:55:42.841
That is the material revision.

02:55:42.881 --> 02:55:43.161
Thank you.

02:55:48.345 --> 02:55:48.825
Good afternoon.

02:55:49.246 --> 02:55:51.347
John Chaban, SEIU Local 10 to 1.

02:55:51.487 --> 02:55:53.609
I urge you to reject this petition.

02:55:53.669 --> 02:55:55.430
It's already been decided at a lower level.

02:55:56.471 --> 02:55:58.893
And I stand in support of small d democracy.

02:55:59.213 --> 02:56:01.175
Those boards were elected to make those decisions.

02:56:01.735 --> 02:56:05.318
You don't have the enforcement authority to oversee such a charter school.

02:56:05.358 --> 02:56:06.979
Oakland already said they couldn't.

02:56:07.359 --> 02:56:08.060
So thank you.

02:56:14.491 --> 02:56:15.872
Good afternoon board members.

02:56:15.912 --> 02:56:18.814
My name is Asa and I am a 12th grader at Fremont High School.

02:56:19.234 --> 02:56:22.035
I am here today to ask you not to approve Latitude's charter school.

02:56:22.736 --> 02:56:25.377
I like Fremont High School because it has taught me to be a critical thinker.

02:56:25.417 --> 02:56:27.378
The teachers are amazing and it has taught me a lot.

02:56:27.699 --> 02:56:35.343
The thing I'm most proud of that I've done in Fremont High School is I have the I have had the opportunity to explore construction careers.

02:56:35.843 --> 02:56:38.385
Fremont has taught me to be a student leader slash organizer.

02:56:38.765 --> 02:56:41.747
If Fremont's budget gets cut again we might lose our pathways.

02:56:41.827 --> 02:56:43.528
Latitude's charter school are going to have

02:56:43.968 --> 02:56:47.169
Very similar academies as such as Media and Architecture Academy.

02:56:48.209 --> 02:56:52.410
Fremont High School right now is expanding and in a few years it will be able to hold 1,200 students.

02:56:52.850 --> 02:56:55.631
Fremont has the next academy which helps English language learners.

02:56:56.051 --> 02:57:02.152
If you approve latitude charter school we can be at risk of losing that academy and our ELL students will not have help.

02:57:02.632 --> 02:57:09.014
I went to an EFC elementary school called the Chief Academy and when I went to middle school I had to get extra help because I was behind.

02:57:10.555 --> 02:57:12.878
EFC did not prepare me for middle school and beyond.

02:57:13.298 --> 02:57:19.665
For the three years I've been at Fremont High School, my mind has been blown by the knowledge I've learned that EFC couldn't provide.

02:57:19.945 --> 02:57:25.391
We have 140 postcards to give you from the community that are against Latitude Charter School.

02:57:25.431 --> 02:57:27.713
Please don't approve another charter school in Oakland.

02:57:31.806 --> 02:57:36.287
Hi, my name is Juan Matias, and I'm in 11th grade at Freemont High School.

02:57:36.647 --> 02:57:39.588
I'm here to ask you to deny Latitude Charter School.

02:57:40.108 --> 02:57:44.229
I love my high school because it helped me to learn the language that I'm speaking right now.

02:57:45.049 --> 02:57:48.970
When I came in the United States, I spoke Mom and Spanish.

02:57:49.530 --> 02:57:51.950
Mom is an indigenous language in Guatemala.

02:57:52.890 --> 02:57:55.571
And my school have a program that calls NEST.

02:57:56.482 --> 02:58:05.987
where the teachers help the students who, the students are like me, who are new to this country, guide the students to learn English.

02:58:07.587 --> 02:58:14.030
If my school budget gets cut again, we will lose the resources that supports the students and teachers.

02:58:14.531 --> 02:58:17.272
Please don't approve another charter school.

02:58:22.489 --> 02:58:28.803
Hello my name is Vida Mendoza and I am an upcoming seventh grader at Life Academy in Oakland Unified School District.

02:58:29.404 --> 02:58:32.892
Today I'm here to talk to you about the charter schools affecting my community.

02:58:35.589 --> 02:58:38.110
There is no room for more schools in Oakland.

02:58:38.470 --> 02:58:39.831
There are enough schools in Oakland.

02:58:40.271 --> 02:58:45.573
So instead of making a new school why not try teaming up to make the schools we already have better.

02:58:46.933 --> 02:58:55.136
When families come to support the charter schools that want to be made there are mostly families from other charter schools but not many families from other public schools.

02:58:55.956 --> 02:59:00.078
I don't want to see my community getting badly affected by this charter school.

02:59:00.378 --> 02:59:02.319
So I ask you to vote no to latitude.

02:59:02.739 --> 02:59:03.039
Thank you.

02:59:10.407 --> 02:59:11.027
Good afternoon.

02:59:11.107 --> 02:59:12.287
My name is Rachel Willis.

02:59:12.347 --> 02:59:14.188
I'm a parent of two students in Oakland.

02:59:14.768 --> 02:59:17.989
I'm a graduate of Fremont High, and I am a native of Oakland as well.

02:59:18.609 --> 02:59:26.490
I graduated high school in 2003, and around that time, OUSD went through the loss of admit counselors and ultimately went into state receivership.

02:59:26.910 --> 02:59:27.751
I'm a product of that.

02:59:27.771 --> 02:59:29.491
I got lost in the system.

02:59:29.511 --> 02:59:34.532
No one tracked me for college, and I was never given the opportunity to explore different types of careers.

02:59:35.352 --> 02:59:38.293
In fact, I didn't receive the support that I needed to be successful.

02:59:39.513 --> 02:59:42.456
I refuse to allow my children to go through those same experiences.

02:59:43.136 --> 02:59:51.804
Now, I've heard that there are too many charter schools in Oakland, but there aren't many high-quality high schools, and that's a problem.

02:59:51.844 --> 02:59:54.406
There are innovative models, but the waiting lists are extensive.

02:59:55.286 --> 03:00:00.651
Currently, it's only 39% of African-American students that are meeting the A through G requirements.

03:00:00.931 --> 03:00:03.353
That is unacceptable for the standards that I have for my children.

03:00:06.757 --> 03:00:12.401
In Oakland, students are seen as dollar signs and most of the board members are actually making decisions based on political gain.

03:00:12.521 --> 03:00:13.903
That is very problematic to us.

03:00:14.703 --> 03:00:24.031
Latitude Opening will give my neighborhood and my opportunity a chance for students to grow and I ask that you approve Latitude to give the students of Oakland an opportunity to explore, be different, and be great.

03:00:24.331 --> 03:00:25.372
Thank you very much and enjoy.

03:00:32.250 --> 03:00:32.990
Good afternoon.

03:00:33.070 --> 03:00:34.511
My name is Renee Swain.

03:00:35.092 --> 03:00:39.774
I'm a retired educator from Oakland Unified School District for over 30 years.

03:00:40.615 --> 03:00:45.497
And essentially, you've heard probably more than you need to hear.

03:00:45.977 --> 03:00:52.001
But I just feel that the charter school would have a negative impact on existing schools.

03:00:52.521 --> 03:00:53.822
We certainly don't need that.

03:00:54.322 --> 03:00:56.323
There have been two previous denials.

03:00:56.763 --> 03:01:01.426
And I'm a member of a group called Educators for Democratic Schools.

03:01:02.046 --> 03:01:11.513
And we actually ask EFC to consider withdrawing because obviously the community doesn't want what they're trying to bring us.

03:01:12.113 --> 03:01:16.697
And we would rather they work within the district instead of at odds with it.

03:01:17.177 --> 03:01:30.287
And so for a variety of reasons, the middle school, Epic Middle School is not performing well, is declining in enrollment, and we don't need another unsuccessful school in Oakland.

03:01:30.507 --> 03:01:30.847
Thank you.

03:01:33.844 --> 03:01:35.544
With the last group of speakers, please line up.

03:01:36.305 --> 03:01:54.889
Ish Armendariz, Natalie Tapian, Maria Valdez, Nidia Baez, Maria Calmo, Michele Calderon, Peter Truong, Linda Halpern, Nick Driver, Truve Men, and Eric Premack.

03:01:59.758 --> 03:02:01.339
Hello, my name is Ishmael Armendariz.

03:02:01.739 --> 03:02:04.760
I'm a special education teacher and disability rights activist.

03:02:05.520 --> 03:02:10.422
Maria Ceja is a mother of one of my students in OUSD.

03:02:10.783 --> 03:02:13.304
Her brother attended Epic Charter School in OUSD.

03:02:13.744 --> 03:02:16.625
Why did Maria have to send kids to do different schools?

03:02:16.945 --> 03:02:18.606
Because Epic does not serve all kids.

03:02:19.906 --> 03:02:22.347
And we know this by my student's story and by the data.

03:02:22.907 --> 03:02:25.147
OUSD, the case misstated that submitted to the state.

03:02:25.507 --> 03:02:30.928
OUSD right now is serving 20% students with IEPs and has 900 pending assessments.

03:02:31.368 --> 03:02:33.409
EPIC charter schools are 7.7%.

03:02:33.669 --> 03:02:41.650
When you look closer at the data EPIC only serves 0.3% students with ID, the most significant need.

03:02:41.750 --> 03:02:42.291
OUSD has 1.1%.

03:02:44.771 --> 03:02:49.773
EPIC only serves students with emotional disturbance at 0.3%, OUSD is at 0.6%.

03:02:50.513 --> 03:02:56.575
And when you look at autism, students with autism, OUSD serves 1.13%, while EPIC only serves 0.4%.

03:02:57.516 --> 03:03:00.697
If you cannot serve all kids, you cannot open a school in Oakland.

03:03:01.057 --> 03:03:06.919
So I urge you to stand with OUSD, stand with the community, stand with disability rights activists, and deny this school.

03:03:14.191 --> 03:03:18.332
Hi my name is Natalia and I'm in the 11th grade in Castlemont High School.

03:03:18.392 --> 03:03:21.633
I am here today to ask you to not approve Latitude Charter School.

03:03:22.053 --> 03:03:25.674
I like Castlemont High School because they value me as an IEP student.

03:03:25.854 --> 03:03:29.575
My care managers check in with me frequently and help me whenever I need them.

03:03:30.035 --> 03:03:35.976
In my past charter school experience they never really checked in with me and never had the yearly meeting I'm supposed to have.

03:03:36.736 --> 03:03:44.138
The thing I'm most proud of that I've done at Casamon is a pathway that's providing me knowledge that I will be able to value in my future career.

03:03:44.819 --> 03:03:55.382
I would like for you to prioritize funding, continue a new school that would bad impact my enrollment and take fundings from my school.

03:03:56.102 --> 03:04:01.047
If Castlemont budgets get cut again, we might lose pathways, classes, and resources.

03:04:01.568 --> 03:04:03.190
Please vote no to the charter school.

03:04:03.330 --> 03:04:09.456
If any of you vote in favor of latitude, then you are saying no to a special education student like me.

03:04:09.816 --> 03:04:10.137
Thank you.

03:04:15.438 --> 03:04:16.919
Hello my name is Maria Valdez.

03:04:17.139 --> 03:04:20.422
I am I mean I am an 11th grader in Casamont high school.

03:04:20.782 --> 03:04:23.104
I am here to ask you not to approve for this new charter school.

03:04:23.684 --> 03:04:32.551
I believe that Casamont is a good school because in my pathway we are helping our community by producing locally grown food and finding sustainable energy.

03:04:33.411 --> 03:04:37.835
We have lots of different opportunities that involve our future and our future careers choices.

03:04:38.755 --> 03:04:44.640
The thing is most the thing that I am most proud of is that all Casamont that all of Casamont we were able to organize

03:04:46.078 --> 03:04:53.086
organized in order to lower slash ensure Castlemont and a few other schools don't get severe budget cuts.

03:04:53.727 --> 03:05:00.895
If Castlemont budgets get cut once again we might lose funding for certain classes and after school programs that benefit students at Castlemont.

03:05:01.656 --> 03:05:09.081
The current staff members we have are taking additional jobs because Casamont doesn't have proper staffing.

03:05:09.862 --> 03:05:15.526
Please don't approve another charter school in Oakland, rather investing in our community schools that have served many generations before us.

03:05:16.307 --> 03:05:17.808
Please oppose to this petition.

03:05:17.868 --> 03:05:18.148
Thank you.

03:05:24.042 --> 03:05:25.703
Hi, my name is Peter Truong.

03:05:25.863 --> 03:05:29.525
I am the leadership teacher at Fremont High School and a partner with Oakland Kids First.

03:05:30.245 --> 03:05:34.267
I've actually had the opportunity to teach both in charter schools and public schools.

03:05:34.707 --> 03:05:37.249
So this is not really about a debate of politics.

03:05:37.269 --> 03:05:39.290
It's about what the right choice is for the Oakland community.

03:05:39.990 --> 03:05:43.432
This school will divert funding from our district and already established schools.

03:05:43.672 --> 03:05:47.173
There is no need to replicate schools and programs that are already present in Oakland.

03:05:48.514 --> 03:05:51.896
It's already been mentioned, Fremont is in the process of rebuilding its school right now.

03:05:52.036 --> 03:05:56.459
It will expand to serve an additional 400 students in the neighborhood that this school is proposing to open in.

03:05:57.760 --> 03:06:04.424
It is fiscally and morally irresponsible to open another charter school when another school in the neighborhood is ready to receive more children.

03:06:05.004 --> 03:06:10.207
It is also a demonstratable falsehood to state that project-based learning is not present in our district.

03:06:10.547 --> 03:06:12.108
There are other schools that champion this.

03:06:12.609 --> 03:06:13.950
There have been mentions of Met West.

03:06:14.430 --> 03:06:17.652
I can talk about multiple high schools such as Fremont High School,

03:06:18.092 --> 03:06:22.996
There are senior projects, there are after school programs, such as the Real Hard program with Oakland Kids First.

03:06:23.557 --> 03:06:25.959
So this is neither new nor is it innovative.

03:06:26.600 --> 03:06:28.721
At a local and county level, we made this decision.

03:06:28.922 --> 03:06:31.484
So we ask you to respect that decision, which is best for us.

03:06:34.957 --> 03:06:35.538
Good afternoon.

03:06:35.578 --> 03:06:36.659
My name is Nydia Baez.

03:06:36.959 --> 03:06:40.462
I was born in Mexico and have been raised in East Oakland.

03:06:40.702 --> 03:06:45.286
I am the current assistant principal at Fremont High School and I'm also a proud Fremont graduate.

03:06:45.867 --> 03:06:52.013
And you should reject this petition because EFC won't succeed in serving the highest need students in Oakland like we do.

03:06:52.413 --> 03:06:58.198
At Fremont High School, we do serve some of these high need students, including 85% free or reduced lunch.

03:06:59.799 --> 03:07:04.402
92% unduplicated, 16% homeless youth, and over 32% special education students.

03:07:04.942 --> 03:07:11.065
EFC presented misleading data to you in an attempt to undermine our community organizing and our community's petition.

03:07:11.465 --> 03:07:16.808
EFC doesn't give the source of their data, and we couldn't substantiate it using EdData or DataQuest.

03:07:17.148 --> 03:07:18.188
What year is it for?

03:07:18.329 --> 03:07:19.029
Is it public?

03:07:19.089 --> 03:07:19.749
Is it internal?

03:07:19.809 --> 03:07:20.569
We couldn't tell.

03:07:20.990 --> 03:07:29.833
So we used public CDE data from EdData and looked at the 2016-17 data for EFC schools, their CMO, OUSD, and Fremont.

03:07:30.253 --> 03:07:36.116
So there is no question that EFC is not serving the same level of high-needs students, so please reject this petition.

03:07:36.216 --> 03:07:36.496
Thank you.

03:07:40.933 --> 03:07:41.693
Good afternoon.

03:07:41.713 --> 03:07:47.717
My name is Tuyet May, and I am an educator of East Oakland Unified School District, and I'm also a parent.

03:07:48.157 --> 03:07:53.080
Today, in front of you, you have a quote of one of the board members of EFC.

03:07:53.380 --> 03:07:54.601
And I'm going to read what I have.

03:07:54.661 --> 03:07:56.602
It has a star right next to it.

03:07:57.082 --> 03:08:05.107
It says, 20 years of creating new schools in Oakland has created a district on the brink and an unsustainable number of charter schools.

03:08:05.467 --> 03:08:06.688
There are few stars.

03:08:07.768 --> 03:08:12.592
Lots of mediocrity and far too many schools that are not delivering for students.

03:08:13.533 --> 03:08:19.078
And the families that need the best schools have almost no chance of assessing them.

03:08:19.779 --> 03:08:23.762
This is what reform has brought.

03:08:24.163 --> 03:08:26.124
These are not my words, as I said earlier.

03:08:26.585 --> 03:08:29.988
These are words of the board member of EFC written just last month.

03:08:31.206 --> 03:08:42.592
Despite declining enrollment and financial trouble, EFC wants to open another school, even though one of its own board member thinks there are too many schools in Oakland.

03:08:43.372 --> 03:08:50.536
This board can no longer pretend that its action does not have consequences.

03:08:51.076 --> 03:08:52.237
Please deny Lytle School.

03:08:52.657 --> 03:08:52.977
Thank you.

03:08:56.818 --> 03:09:01.343
Hi, I'm Linda Halpin, a retired teacher from Castlemont High School.

03:09:02.424 --> 03:09:11.654
And now I am currently a mentor or coach with the BITSA program, training new teachers as they come into Oakland.

03:09:12.075 --> 03:09:15.198
That includes charters, private, and public.

03:09:16.539 --> 03:09:18.981
It is my 10 years I've been doing this.

03:09:19.681 --> 03:09:28.406
The teachers in the public schools are by far the most talented, skilled, and committed.

03:09:28.826 --> 03:09:35.870
They are trained in various ways through various programs, one of which is BITSA.

03:09:36.391 --> 03:09:38.452
They have workshops they have to go to.

03:09:38.912 --> 03:09:45.256
Teacher training is key, and Oakland Unified District does a superb job at this.

03:09:46.016 --> 03:09:50.059
I suggest that you reject the charter school.

03:09:50.559 --> 03:09:50.939
Thank you.

03:09:54.982 --> 03:09:56.823
Eric Premack, Charter Schools Development Center.

03:09:56.903 --> 03:10:01.986
This is a group that we have worked with for a long, long time, since before EFC even started.

03:10:03.087 --> 03:10:03.227
The

03:10:04.299 --> 03:10:08.240
The larger management organization has a very positive strong track record.

03:10:08.340 --> 03:10:12.141
The particular team on developing this school has a long strong track record.

03:10:12.661 --> 03:10:18.683
Petition is clearly compliant as demonstrated by the staff review at the district, county, and state level.

03:10:18.723 --> 03:10:21.063
We think this one is an absolute slam dunk.

03:10:21.563 --> 03:10:24.264
I have been listening carefully here since the beginning.

03:10:24.644 --> 03:10:27.485
I have yet to hear one single valid reason for denial.

03:10:27.952 --> 03:10:31.233
I do understand because I lived in Oakland and I've watched it for many years.

03:10:31.293 --> 03:10:37.395
The district has a decades-long history of unfortunate management decisions that have placed it in a very tough position.

03:10:37.975 --> 03:10:39.655
That's not the fault of the charter school.

03:10:39.695 --> 03:10:41.096
It's not the fault of Latitude.

03:10:42.136 --> 03:10:43.477
We would urge you to approve this.

03:10:43.717 --> 03:10:44.037
Thank you.

03:10:48.518 --> 03:10:50.659
Good afternoon, President Kirst, board members.

03:10:50.779 --> 03:10:51.719
My name is Nick Driver.

03:10:52.788 --> 03:10:56.131
I'm proud to serve as board chair for Education for Change Public Schools.

03:10:56.171 --> 03:11:00.275
I've been on the board for the last six years, the last three of which as board chair.

03:11:01.056 --> 03:11:06.181
I've been working in charter schools for the last 14, and I want to just note a couple of things about our board.

03:11:07.382 --> 03:11:11.867
We have an 11-member board that is a majority-minority board.

03:11:12.527 --> 03:11:16.952
We've worked really hard to have a diverse board that has three hardworking committees.

03:11:18.112 --> 03:11:21.875
two elected family board members who were elected by their peers.

03:11:22.435 --> 03:11:26.297
We also have governance and finance experts on our board.

03:11:26.317 --> 03:11:31.981
You heard from my colleague, Dirk Tillotson, earlier, who actually does governance training.

03:11:32.661 --> 03:11:34.042
throughout the state and other states.

03:11:34.883 --> 03:11:42.528
And so we we feel that we take our jobs as overseers and overseers of the staff very seriously.

03:11:43.208 --> 03:11:47.171
And we're always working harder to be better.

03:11:47.191 --> 03:11:56.657
If you have any questions about our governance I know the question that came up I would be happy to answer any questions along with our CEO and our founding principal Lillian Hsu.

03:11:57.138 --> 03:11:57.758
Thank you very much.

03:11:57.958 --> 03:12:01.901
And I urge you to support the recommendation of staff and vote for high school.

03:12:02.021 --> 03:12:02.281
Thank you.

03:12:04.383 --> 03:12:08.028
Okay, that concludes the public comment period.

03:12:08.288 --> 03:12:14.155
And so I'd like Lisa to come back up from the California Department of Education and

03:12:15.502 --> 03:12:39.670
Talk about the grounds for which the board has the authority to either approve or deny charters We're an administrative body operating under a law a law of the legislature So we've heard various reasons and maybe you can comment on how that those fit with the law Yes, okay, so In terms of the Education Code

03:12:41.235 --> 03:13:01.920
It's, and this is, go back to 47605, states the governing board of the school district shall not deny a petition for establishment of a charter school unless it makes written factual findings specific to the particular petition, setting forth specific facts to support one or more of the following findings.

03:13:01.940 --> 03:13:07.801
So the first is that the charter school presents an unsound educational program for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school.

03:13:08.681 --> 03:13:14.689
Number two is the petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition.

03:13:15.510 --> 03:13:25.963
Third, the petition does not contain the number of signatures required by subdivision A. The petition does not contain an affirmation of each of the conditions described in the subdivision.

03:13:26.583 --> 03:13:32.608
And the petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive description of all of the following, which are the charter elements.

03:13:33.129 --> 03:13:43.677
So, basically the board would have to make a finding of one of those five to not move forward with the charter petition, to not approve the charter petition.

03:13:44.598 --> 03:13:44.978
Thank you.

03:13:45.279 --> 03:13:52.625
Board member, our liaison board member Williams has another question for you on the legal issues here.

03:13:53.345 --> 03:13:54.546
I have a question about the

03:13:56.963 --> 03:13:58.804
whether or not there was a material change.

03:13:59.605 --> 03:14:00.926
And that's not how I read.

03:14:01.446 --> 03:14:03.167
I was involved in that conversation.

03:14:03.207 --> 03:14:05.669
So I think I know the answer, but I'd like you to put it on the record.

03:14:06.590 --> 03:14:06.730
OK.

03:14:06.830 --> 03:14:15.376
So, actually, this happened before the ACCS meeting where there was a letter that was submitted by the petitioner as part of the package.

03:14:16.056 --> 03:14:22.741
And the letter goes into state that they will make the changes necessary to make the board the authorizer and so forth.

03:14:23.201 --> 03:14:27.884
One of the statements in the letter stated that they wanted to open next year in 1920.

03:14:27.964 --> 03:14:38.630
We were very clear with the petitioner before the ACCS meeting, because this came up then as well, that we were moving forward with a petition as is, opening in 1819.

03:14:39.151 --> 03:14:42.052
So, the petition states that they will open in 1819.

03:14:42.272 --> 03:14:45.254
That's the same petition that was before the school district.

03:14:45.674 --> 03:14:47.455
I'm sorry, did I misspeak?

03:14:48.336 --> 03:14:49.217
18-19, 18-19.

03:14:50.338 --> 03:14:53.780
So this fall, so the petition states they are going to open this fall.

03:14:54.261 --> 03:15:04.508
The enrollment criteria, even the chart you have that I passed around to everyone that came straight from the petition, shows the 50 students in opening up this fall.

03:15:04.789 --> 03:15:08.972
So we were very clear that we were not moving forward with a material revision to open next

03:15:09.352 --> 03:15:16.018
next year, that we were moving forward with the petition as it was opening this fall with the 50 students.

03:15:16.499 --> 03:15:20.683
And the petitioner said, yes, they could do that and wanted to do that.

03:15:20.703 --> 03:15:21.764
Yes, they did.

03:15:21.804 --> 03:15:25.187
They confirmed that that was indeed what we were moving forward with.

03:15:26.668 --> 03:15:29.951
OK, with that, then let's open up further board discussion.

03:15:30.011 --> 03:15:31.312
Board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

03:15:34.847 --> 03:15:44.271
Thank you and I'll start with with some statements because these are always difficult hearings and welcome Hema you will be part of these difficult conversations and decisions very soon.

03:15:45.992 --> 03:15:58.338
Part of what what we heard a lot was the impact that this would have to the host district and we heard that from students we heard it from some of the elected officials here and obviously from some of the supporters

03:15:59.078 --> 03:16:05.201
And unfortunately that as the reasons for denial were read, that is not one of the reasons, right?

03:16:05.301 --> 03:16:09.683
And we have to work within the legal parameters that we have.

03:16:10.263 --> 03:16:15.505
But some of you submitted letters from legislators and maybe they could help you change that law.

03:16:15.946 --> 03:16:19.107
We have to adhere by what's currently in place in that code.

03:16:20.308 --> 03:16:24.349
So because we can't consider that, we have to consider the recommendation.

03:16:24.830 --> 03:16:27.851
Two bodies did deny this proposal.

03:16:28.391 --> 03:16:35.376
but both of the bodies denied it with a recommendation for approval by each of your department folks.

03:16:35.437 --> 03:16:36.077
Is that correct?

03:16:36.958 --> 03:16:41.541
So the Oakland Unified, the recommendation was to approve the charter.

03:16:41.561 --> 03:16:47.966
In Alameda, the recommendation was to approve, but the elected officials or the board decided to deny.

03:16:49.607 --> 03:16:51.549
So that's speaking to the education.

03:16:51.609 --> 03:16:57.814
I know that there was some questions or some comments about the soundness of the application, the proposal,

03:16:58.234 --> 03:17:05.198
but they were both bodies or both departments opted to recommend approval.

03:17:05.778 --> 03:17:24.449
So the concern that I have though is based on some of the comments that were made about under-enrollment in some of the other schools that are part of the CMO, the Charter Management Organization, and this notion that African-American students and students with disabilities are under-enrolled compared to the neighborhood schools.

03:17:25.089 --> 03:17:37.074
I went back to the presentation, and I didn't see anything on the academic performance of your other seven schools, which I believe are all located in the East Bay or mainly Oakland.

03:17:38.154 --> 03:17:42.796
So I know this is a new school, but you do have seven other schools.

03:17:42.856 --> 03:17:45.297
And I want to know, what is the enrollment of those schools?

03:17:45.597 --> 03:17:50.639
What is the academic performance specifically for African-American students and students with disabilities?

03:17:50.899 --> 03:17:52.359
So if you could come back up.

03:17:52.379 --> 03:17:54.380
I'm going to invite Ethan Thomas.

03:17:57.386 --> 03:17:57.686
Thank you.

03:17:58.907 --> 03:18:03.308
And Felicia, could we also hear for Latino students, the percentages?

03:18:03.448 --> 03:18:04.428
Yes, of course, mi gente.

03:18:04.688 --> 03:18:07.049
Yes.

03:18:07.709 --> 03:18:08.490
Good afternoon.

03:18:08.530 --> 03:18:09.610
My name is Hasten Thomas.

03:18:09.670 --> 03:18:15.132
I'm the CEO of Education for Change Public Schools, and I've been a 25-year educator in Oakland Public Schools.

03:18:15.933 --> 03:18:19.839
I don't know that I have all the particulars of the disaggregated data for each school.

03:18:19.859 --> 03:18:27.330
I will say this, our student population is 92% unduplicated count, 87% free and reduced lunch, 54% ELL.

03:18:31.176 --> 03:18:34.019
It is going to be a fairly different school.

03:18:36.361 --> 03:18:38.462
Some of the soul searching we did, our schools are neighborhood schools.

03:18:38.482 --> 03:18:39.483
They have attendance boundaries.

03:18:39.503 --> 03:18:43.867
They're in the Fruitvale, which is a pretty Hispanic community.

03:18:45.128 --> 03:18:48.090
Frankly, Oakland is a pretty segregated city, and the schools are pretty segregated.

03:18:48.511 --> 03:18:53.315
Oakland does serve more African-American students, and Oakland Unified as a whole does not necessarily look like EFC.

03:18:53.895 --> 03:18:56.857
I'm not going to play funny data games.

03:18:57.798 --> 03:19:02.541
That said, it is the reason why we made a decision to make Latitude a diversified design school.

03:19:03.081 --> 03:19:15.869
It is the only school in the city that will have a zip code based lottery, where the number of spaces preference in a given zip code is proportional to the number of students residing in that zip code.

03:19:16.189 --> 03:19:24.114
The purpose of that is actually to create a high school that benefits from the beautiful diversity of Oakland, which many high schools don't.

03:19:24.194 --> 03:19:26.395
Some high schools do, but some don't.

03:19:26.515 --> 03:19:29.897
And I think that the reality of the diversity became a priority for us.

03:19:31.738 --> 03:19:35.060
And so just to be clear, the performance of our current schools

03:19:37.942 --> 03:19:42.948
The demographics will be pretty different from latitude, which is trying to mimic more what does Oakland look like.

03:19:43.048 --> 03:19:50.317
That said, one of the things I'm most proud of right now is that we have doubled down on instructional improvement.

03:19:50.377 --> 03:19:55.824
We do not look at our results and say, this is satisfactory, this is okay for our high-poverty youth.

03:19:56.364 --> 03:20:00.766
And so this past year, we took a huge focus around TK1 literacy.

03:20:01.087 --> 03:20:05.409
We invested, which is actually some of our financial woes, was not financial woes.

03:20:06.189 --> 03:20:08.731
Our board made a conscious decision to invest.

03:20:09.131 --> 03:20:13.093
We started the school year with over $7 million in reserves and a $40 million budget.

03:20:15.134 --> 03:20:27.439
we decided to spend some money, because our performance says, if we can double down on this transition to Common Core and really build capacity of our teachers to really figure out what the rigor looks like, this will actually pay out in dividends over the years.

03:20:27.879 --> 03:20:33.641
So TKK1-2 literacy, 3-4-5 problem solving, and a 6-7-8 focus on math.

03:20:34.181 --> 03:20:37.303
I'm really proud to say that our distance from met in math

03:20:38.383 --> 03:20:40.684
As an org, went from negative 80 to negative 56.

03:20:41.865 --> 03:20:47.427
And in ELA, this is preliminary data that's trickling in now, minus 70 to minus 48.

03:20:49.348 --> 03:21:04.574
We just passed a three-year instructional strategic plan that actually doubles down on what we call wins, instructional wins, and make sure that actually all of these gains persist until our target in three years of actually exceeding the state average.

03:21:05.394 --> 03:21:06.395
We are not where we want to be.

03:21:07.055 --> 03:21:10.317
But I think we made huge gains for EL kids.

03:21:10.337 --> 03:21:11.857
We made huge gains for African-American students.

03:21:11.897 --> 03:21:13.998
And we made huge gains for special education students this year.

03:21:14.679 --> 03:21:16.580
Do those students perform where we want them to?

03:21:16.880 --> 03:21:17.000
No.

03:21:18.260 --> 03:21:23.403
Are we showing what the state would say are dramatic gains of 20 to 25 points?

03:21:23.423 --> 03:21:23.483
Yes.

03:21:30.939 --> 03:21:38.181
Well, she answered the question about the new model based on zip code, and it is true.

03:21:38.201 --> 03:21:43.842
Oakland is a highly segregated city, and there is quite a difference between the hills and what happens in the flatlands.

03:21:43.882 --> 03:21:46.342
And I think that that is one of the concerns that we also heard.

03:21:46.882 --> 03:21:50.323
But there was also claims about under-enrollment.

03:21:50.603 --> 03:21:54.464
And again, you have six schools currently in place.

03:21:54.504 --> 03:21:55.664
This would be your seventh.

03:21:56.504 --> 03:21:58.685
What does your strategic plan call for?

03:21:58.765 --> 03:21:59.305
How many schools?

03:22:00.585 --> 03:22:04.126
Our current strategic plan actually only calls for the next three to four years.

03:22:04.746 --> 03:22:08.427
The seven would be the six schools plus latitude should you approve it today.

03:22:08.767 --> 03:22:14.029
We do not have any and we don't have any plans for growth at this juncture just to double down on instructional improvement.

03:22:14.989 --> 03:22:17.110
So I guess the question would be fair.

03:22:17.170 --> 03:22:20.831
Why not focus on are all of your schools under enrolled or just EPIC?

03:22:21.611 --> 03:22:22.391
Just EPIC right now.

03:22:22.938 --> 03:22:26.120
OK, do you know what may be causing some of those challenges?

03:22:26.560 --> 03:22:27.481
At EPIC specifically?

03:22:27.501 --> 03:22:28.461
I'll tell you this.

03:22:29.162 --> 03:22:30.583
We've been in existence for 13 years.

03:22:30.603 --> 03:22:36.606
So this year was the first year that we saw our projections be so off.

03:22:37.427 --> 03:22:47.973
Fortunately, because we have a fairly conservative budgeting process and a significant reserve, we were able to weather that without risking programs or mid-year cuts or cutting programs for kids.

03:22:49.114 --> 03:22:54.721
That said, we do have a fairly conservative board, and I took a couple lashings for this year.

03:22:55.682 --> 03:22:59.387
And moving forward, we have a balanced budget for 18-19.

03:22:59.447 --> 03:23:05.875
Every single school that was under-projected, actually, so we projected 100 kids fewer for next year.

03:23:07.116 --> 03:23:10.638
And all of our schools were expected to make those cuts, including Epic.

03:23:10.678 --> 03:23:14.980
And Epic had, needless to say, we projected them for a little over 300 kids.

03:23:15.040 --> 03:23:17.661
And this is a school we had originally designed for 400 plus.

03:23:18.142 --> 03:23:19.983
I'm not going to lie and say it hasn't had struggles.

03:23:20.163 --> 03:23:27.527
I will say that that school also individually made something in the ballpark of 20 to 25 point gains in their difference from MET.

03:23:28.087 --> 03:23:32.470
And that what we're seeing is really dramatic improvement and acceleration at that school.

03:23:33.170 --> 03:23:42.641
It is a school that, you know, it's in its fourth year, and we have seen, and it's a middle school, and it's a new middle school, and we saw some struggles.

03:23:43.102 --> 03:23:51.732
But one of the things that's nice about being a CMO, frankly, and part of the reason why I don't do a singleton charter and I no longer work for the school district, frankly, is that

03:23:52.012 --> 03:24:06.162
The ability to have a stable group of schools that are making good improvements, that have stable leadership, and then to be able to invest and double down in a single school that might be struggling is sort of the gift or the privilege of having a larger organization with a bigger budget, with a bigger reserve.

03:24:06.502 --> 03:24:08.844
So that's what we did at EPIC, and I think it paid out.

03:24:09.624 --> 03:24:28.217
We're going to continue to this year though with without additional investment They were requested to to balance their budget and they did and I think they did it thoughtfully And in a way that we believe they will continue to maintain the gains that they have Other board member comments Eileen Strauss

03:24:30.271 --> 03:24:33.852
So I do have a question, a couple of clarifying questions, and then some comments.

03:24:33.872 --> 03:24:39.794
So if approved today, you will open in the 18-19 year of 50 students.

03:24:39.814 --> 03:24:40.134
Is that right?

03:24:40.154 --> 03:24:40.614
Correct, yes.

03:24:40.754 --> 03:24:45.275
And I heard you say you'll have a zip code guarantee to reflect the appropriate demographics.

03:24:45.295 --> 03:24:52.377
We have a zip code-based lottery, which means the number of spaces in any given zip code, preferences are given until those spaces are filled.

03:24:52.478 --> 03:24:55.758
And then they, so it's a little hard to explain.

03:24:55.778 --> 03:24:56.879
I've never done one before.

03:24:57.899 --> 03:25:04.943
It's designed so that if we get too many applicants in a given zip code, the kids in the other zip codes get preference.

03:25:04.963 --> 03:25:09.225
So school opens in a month, more or less, three weeks, five weeks.

03:25:09.725 --> 03:25:22.532
So if we approve today and you commit to what you proposed, which was opening, do you have the names of the students who have already agreed and committed to come if you open?

03:25:22.632 --> 03:25:23.513
You have a space.

03:25:24.013 --> 03:25:24.993
What's the plan?

03:25:25.053 --> 03:25:26.014
That's my first question.

03:25:26.534 --> 03:25:31.856
Well, I mean, so we have done a massive outreach to all of our applicants.

03:25:31.916 --> 03:25:34.837
We've been communicating with them regularly so they know what's going on.

03:25:34.917 --> 03:25:40.018
Needless to say, we said, hey, have a backup because we do not want you to be without an option in August.

03:25:40.398 --> 03:25:44.359
So every student that we outreach to and who apply to the school has a school.

03:25:44.580 --> 03:25:47.180
Some of them we've called in the last couple of weeks since ACCS.

03:25:47.821 --> 03:25:52.402
We didn't want to call anybody until ACCS just so we could, you know, be thoughtful and responsible.

03:25:52.682 --> 03:25:55.204
But some of the kids said, hey, I'm going to Fremont.

03:25:55.224 --> 03:25:56.585
I'm going to MetWest.

03:25:56.826 --> 03:25:58.147
I'm excited about my option.

03:25:58.187 --> 03:25:59.928
And some of the kids said, great.

03:25:59.948 --> 03:26:02.210
I'm waiting with bated breath for your school.

03:26:02.290 --> 03:26:05.633
So do we have approximately 50 kids?

03:26:07.054 --> 03:26:07.715
If approved.

03:26:09.196 --> 03:26:09.817
If approved.

03:26:10.337 --> 03:26:11.378
Do you have staffing?

03:26:11.979 --> 03:26:12.880
Do you have teachers to open?

03:26:12.980 --> 03:26:13.840
We are fully staffed.

03:26:18.260 --> 03:26:20.121
Yes, so we are fully staffed.

03:26:20.341 --> 03:26:28.444
So Education for Change has invested in this school so that if we are not authorized, all of these teachers would still have a position within Education for Change.

03:26:28.784 --> 03:26:35.306
We wanted to make sure we were not jeopardizing any student, any teacher's livelihood, but all of the teachers have been identified and are ready to go.

03:26:37.398 --> 03:26:42.640
Okay, well, so I think my comments are just more general now, not targeted particularly toward you.

03:26:42.740 --> 03:26:47.923
First, it's clear that Education for Change is committed to providing quality programs for students.

03:26:48.283 --> 03:26:53.565
But I heard from Oakland Board and for community, students first is what they want.

03:26:53.625 --> 03:26:56.187
I actually think students first is what everybody wants.

03:26:56.347 --> 03:26:57.587
I actually really heard that.

03:26:58.208 --> 03:27:03.530
The dilemma I heard is that we know that Oakland Unified is in financial challenges.

03:27:03.570 --> 03:27:05.351
They've had to make huge budget cuts mid-year.

03:27:06.271 --> 03:27:11.554
And the question that we were faced by some of the audience was, should we be opening more schools?

03:27:11.614 --> 03:27:14.535
Which actually is not a question this board can determine.

03:27:14.895 --> 03:27:16.496
That's not our determination.

03:27:17.457 --> 03:27:22.019
And what's best for Oakland Unified and what would help their budget?

03:27:22.299 --> 03:27:26.261
That's also not, unfortunately, a rationale for not opening.

03:27:26.721 --> 03:27:35.587
The other thing I heard was that we need to support school innovation and better options for Oakland students and that actually is what we're about and it is what the charter school is about.

03:27:35.607 --> 03:27:42.131
So I think we're stuck between wanting great things for kids and I think everybody wants that that came before us, everybody.

03:27:43.052 --> 03:27:49.216
And yet I think that we have a really clear guidance based on the law about what we can approve and not prove.

03:27:49.256 --> 03:27:54.159
And I think the dilemma is the financial challenges in Oakland over a long period of time.

03:27:54.199 --> 03:27:56.121
This is not a new problem and also the

03:27:57.021 --> 03:28:01.345
long-term number of charters versus the declining in the local district.

03:28:01.406 --> 03:28:07.031
And that sounds to me like Dr. Johnson and the board have a lot of work ahead to do.

03:28:07.571 --> 03:28:13.257
But that is not, that doesn't influence if you can approve a good charter school.

03:28:13.297 --> 03:28:19.823
And I think that's just my comment to the public is that I think everyone I heard in front of us said they wanted students first.

03:28:20.303 --> 03:28:24.667
So I think that's what we want and I think we want better options.

03:28:24.687 --> 03:28:27.970
I also think parents want better options as well sometimes.

03:28:28.050 --> 03:28:34.095
So I just hear the local dilemma and I think that that's what we heard here in this room.

03:28:35.216 --> 03:28:38.719
And I certainly hope that should things go forward that

03:28:39.740 --> 03:28:48.829
that the ECS will commit to representing the fair population of what Oakland Unified has for their programs.

03:28:49.470 --> 03:28:49.690
Thanks.

03:28:49.830 --> 03:28:50.010
Okay.

03:28:50.090 --> 03:28:52.933
Chief Deputy Superintendent Glenn Price wants to speak.

03:28:53.213 --> 03:28:54.374
Well, thank you, President Kirsten.

03:28:54.394 --> 03:28:59.860
I just wanted to build a little bit on the comments made by Board Member Ortiz-Lee Cohen and Board Member Strauss.

03:29:00.839 --> 03:29:12.910
In so doing, I want to be clear that Superintendent Torlakson stands behind the staff analysis and recommendations that we bring forward today based on the really excellent work of Division Director Lisa Constancia and her team.

03:29:12.950 --> 03:29:20.196
And I've just been so impressed with your work over the past few days, Lisa, and really want to hope that you express that appreciation to your team.

03:29:20.236 --> 03:29:22.218
So these comments that I'm going to

03:29:23.044 --> 03:29:30.170
this review really addressed to several policy areas that the superintendent is seeing emerging from this work.

03:29:30.250 --> 03:29:39.999
And we've been just so engaged and involved and appreciative of the principle of subsidiarity that's guided our work over the last seven and a half years or so.

03:29:40.840 --> 03:29:44.223
And in using that principle, we've really together, working together,

03:29:44.881 --> 03:29:48.744
revolutionized basically the totality of our education system.

03:29:48.764 --> 03:29:55.408
So just to say that when there are things and policy areas that are coming before us as challenges, these are things that can be changed.

03:29:55.769 --> 03:29:57.870
And we've shown that by changing standards.

03:29:57.950 --> 03:30:01.933
And Dr. Kirst, I so appreciate your article around Common Core changing everything.

03:30:01.993 --> 03:30:03.614
And really have changed everything.

03:30:03.634 --> 03:30:10.759
A new funding system, local control funding formula, obviously grounded in a fundamental ethos of local control.

03:30:11.365 --> 03:30:17.368
A whole new concept of accountability moving away from a sole reliance on test scores to a multiple measure system.

03:30:18.288 --> 03:30:24.811
And a decentralized system of support in which local county offices and LEAs play a critical role.

03:30:24.891 --> 03:30:32.535
So, in short, revolutionary changes where we've really been emphasizing local control and capacity building.

03:30:33.564 --> 03:30:49.110
But we're still, I would say, handicapped or governed by two key pieces of legislation from the 1990s that are guiding important work being undertaken by the State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction.

03:30:49.130 --> 03:30:56.953
And that would be AB 1200, that's modified a little bit by AB 2756, and the Charter Schools Act of 1992.

03:30:57.033 --> 03:30:59.094
And thank you, Lisa, for referring that to us.

03:31:00.701 --> 03:31:10.332
I think that, obviously, persuasive arguments could be made that those statutes have accomplished a lot since they have been enacted.

03:31:10.413 --> 03:31:15.959
But I think even more persuasive arguments could be made that they've outlived their usefulness in key areas.

03:31:17.199 --> 03:31:36.598
and there's a need to be modernizing them and that's nowhere more acute as I think both board member Ortiz-Ligon and board member Strauss articulated where they intersect which is where we the case that we have today where we have a district that's under state receivership being governed by the statute of AB 1200 and when we're considering a

03:31:37.336 --> 03:31:39.380
a charter application.

03:31:39.901 --> 03:31:47.134
So under AB 1200, the superintendent of public instruction is charged with supporting districts to return to financial health.

03:31:47.775 --> 03:31:50.059
That's a major charge that the superintendent has.

03:31:50.652 --> 03:32:03.538
Yet under our current charter laws, as Director Constancio articulated, the SPI has no authority to do charter authorization in spite of the clear financial impact that charters may cause within a local context.

03:32:03.958 --> 03:32:10.601
So a lot of responsibility has been given to the superintendent without all of the necessary authority.

03:32:11.821 --> 03:32:18.524
At the same time, I think everyone would concede that the education and charter landscape has changed dramatically since 1992.

03:32:20.985 --> 03:32:24.868
while the charter authorization process in particular has only been tweaked slightly.

03:32:25.709 --> 03:32:28.992
And we've seen some unforeseen outcomes that have arisen as a result of that.

03:32:29.672 --> 03:32:34.736
I think that right now this board is the second largest authorizer of charters in the state of California.

03:32:35.957 --> 03:32:41.481
Which I don't think was something that anybody would have thought about it back in 1992.

03:32:42.182 --> 03:32:44.604
And then just taking that to the Department of Education,

03:32:45.327 --> 03:32:55.470
our own resources being responsible for supporting, just letting you know this, for supporting the charter schools that are authorized by the State Board of Education are stretched incredibly thin.

03:32:56.490 --> 03:33:06.733
And obviously flies in the face of our commitment and in contrast with our commitment to local control when we're trying to support charters that are stretched across the whole state of California.

03:33:08.174 --> 03:33:12.595
So in the case of the charter now being considered for Oakland, the local,

03:33:13.806 --> 03:33:16.788
democratically elected school board has denied the charter.

03:33:17.828 --> 03:33:25.092
The democratically elected Alameda County Board of Education, I think I saw Trustee Varick in the room, in the back.

03:33:25.873 --> 03:33:28.754
They've never been accused of being anti-charter, but it also denied it.

03:33:30.155 --> 03:33:35.338
Both these entities, as they've articulated and communicated, have approved charters previously.

03:33:36.087 --> 03:33:47.391
But they know that at some point we have to consider the whole ecosystem, the whole community that we're operating in when making these decisions.

03:33:47.451 --> 03:33:57.155
And there's no other area of local or community planning where we would not consider the financial impact of a decision when making those decisions.

03:33:57.255 --> 03:33:58.796
LAFCO would never do that.

03:33:59.412 --> 03:34:02.596
Any city planning commission would never do that.

03:34:03.958 --> 03:34:17.215
So and of course the equity imperative when you think about the need to provide significant support to Oakland Unified to surmount some of the incredibly challenges that it's facing are clear.

03:34:18.368 --> 03:34:26.598
So I just make these comments to argue that it's time for us to take a fresh look at new policy directions for the state in this area.

03:34:27.599 --> 03:34:38.451
Discuss this with the superintendent of public instruction and he's going to be looking at making recommendations so that we can start to think about what are the new policy directions that we can take.

03:34:39.645 --> 03:34:59.900
As we approach this transition period that we're coming into, we can at least build on the body of our experience over the last seven and a half years to make some recommendations moving forward so that we can move to a place where this key area of our work, charter authorization, is aligned with the really great changes that we've made in other areas.

03:34:59.981 --> 03:35:01.962
So we'll be working on that.

03:35:01.982 --> 03:35:02.663
Hope to invite

03:35:03.863 --> 03:35:09.124
of the State Board of Education and others to participate and we look forward to coming back and maybe having a discussion around those.

03:35:09.864 --> 03:35:10.205
Thank you.

03:35:10.685 --> 03:35:11.445
Okay.

03:35:14.085 --> 03:35:16.886
Board Member Williams is next.

03:35:19.387 --> 03:35:29.029
That said, there are four legal reasons that we can deny a petition authorization and

03:35:30.782 --> 03:35:39.486
fiscal impact on the district is not one of them, which I'm assuming that's one of the things that you and the superintendent would like to see addressed at some point.

03:35:40.866 --> 03:35:42.307
But it's not addressed now.

03:35:42.727 --> 03:35:46.989
So we have before us a petition for authorization.

03:35:47.629 --> 03:35:52.411
It meets, it does not meet any of the reasons for denial.

03:35:53.892 --> 03:36:05.522
In addition, I'll remind, I don't have to remind the board, but I'll remind the audience that the board is charged with doing a de novo review of the petition, meaning with fresh eyes.

03:36:05.603 --> 03:36:06.804
It's not an appellate review.

03:36:06.844 --> 03:36:12.589
We're not overturning, if we decide to authorize it, overturning a previous decision.

03:36:12.609 --> 03:36:19.595
We're making our own decision based upon all of our own analysis, including information from the district and the county.

03:36:20.395 --> 03:36:26.738
including information from CDE staff and state board staff, including the advisory commission on charter schools.

03:36:28.159 --> 03:36:35.203
It's been my experience we leave very few stones unturned when a charter gets up to the state board level.

03:36:35.303 --> 03:36:37.344
We know it's very serious for all parties.

03:36:38.184 --> 03:36:41.746
So we don't have a reason for denial based on the legal reasons.

03:36:41.806 --> 03:36:44.967
We do have an obligation to do a de novo review.

03:36:45.547 --> 03:36:51.770
It is true that the staffs of the district and the staffs of the county recommended approval of this petition.

03:36:52.570 --> 03:36:57.993
Our own Department of Ed staff has recommended approval of this petition.

03:36:59.053 --> 03:37:13.941
I've heard from our staff that it is one of the best put together instructional models and organized with the leadership and the governance and all the other pieces that they've ever seen.

03:37:15.501 --> 03:37:20.883
I am familiar with the high-tech, high model of zip code preferences.

03:37:21.123 --> 03:37:29.827
It's done down in San Diego as a way to encourage social integration of many different kinds of kids, not from all over the area.

03:37:31.528 --> 03:37:37.432
I'm familiar with some of the instructional models because I live in San Diego, so I'm familiar with High Tech High.

03:37:38.173 --> 03:37:42.716
This school is not High Tech High, and it's got a lot of new and different kinds of things that it's adding to it.

03:37:43.476 --> 03:37:53.924
The ACCS voted to authorize the school, to recommend to us, to approve the school by a vote of six yes for authorization and one abstention.

03:37:55.749 --> 03:37:58.072
So, if you're ready for a motion, I'm ready to make one.

03:37:58.092 --> 03:37:59.073
Why don't you make a motion?

03:37:59.494 --> 03:38:00.635
I know we have more comment.

03:38:00.995 --> 03:38:05.561
Okay, then I would move the staff's recommendation to authorize this charter.

03:38:07.703 --> 03:38:08.885
Board Member Ortiz-Lacombe.

03:38:10.867 --> 03:38:11.748
Oh, Patricia Rocker.

03:38:18.326 --> 03:38:20.690
I have a question for the Latitude representative.

03:38:21.671 --> 03:38:27.779
And you may want to bring up your COO or whoever answered the original question concerning enrollment.

03:38:28.060 --> 03:38:31.184
I still have a concern about the African-American enrollment.

03:38:31.544 --> 03:38:34.829
Even though my colleague says we don't have a reason

03:38:35.359 --> 03:38:36.400
to reject the charter.

03:38:36.560 --> 03:38:41.423
I have a concern about, and I want to dig a little deeper about the enrollment numbers.

03:38:41.463 --> 03:38:43.945
How long have you been in operation in Oakland?

03:38:44.365 --> 03:38:44.966
Thirteen years.

03:38:45.186 --> 03:38:52.471
And in thirteen years, you haven't figured out how to improve the enrollment of African-American students at your existing schools?

03:38:54.485 --> 03:38:59.991
So these schools, there were two schools in the first couple of years.

03:39:00.892 --> 03:39:02.815
And I'm not going to say that we serve as many African Americans.

03:39:02.855 --> 03:39:03.736
Okay, I'll stop you.

03:39:04.016 --> 03:39:05.277
I'm going to ask my question again.

03:39:06.058 --> 03:39:14.488
In 13 years, for the schools you have existing right now, what is your plan to improve the enrollment

03:39:14.828 --> 03:39:17.630
of African-American students at those schools?

03:39:17.670 --> 03:39:19.991
Do you have one and have you put it in place?

03:39:20.091 --> 03:39:28.895
So part of the reason we are talking about as an organization whether we should do more system-wide, district-wide recruitment.

03:39:29.275 --> 03:39:30.296
That answer would be yes.

03:39:30.516 --> 03:39:30.696
Right.

03:39:31.236 --> 03:39:31.597
I'm sorry?

03:39:31.737 --> 03:39:32.857
That answer should be yes.

03:39:33.778 --> 03:39:34.018
Yes.

03:39:35.078 --> 03:39:35.218
And

03:39:36.719 --> 03:39:53.303
Because we have not we've only recruited within the attendance boundaries traditionally We are now looking at it more of a citywide recruitment strategy that looks at recruiting from all over the city and even considering Rethinking sort of our neighborhood attendance boundary preference as an absolute preference there.

03:39:53.363 --> 03:39:59.184
Yes, there is discussion happening for this two schools that we actually so latitude would be a school where we don't have a tenants boundary and

03:39:59.424 --> 03:40:01.206
And EPIC actually does not have an attendance boundary.

03:40:01.746 --> 03:40:18.142
And EPIC has a student population that does have a higher African-American population for the Fruitvale as compared to some of the other, frankly, other middle schools in Oakland Unified School District and charter public schools in the district in that particular neighborhood.

03:40:18.162 --> 03:40:20.905
So EPIC is, I believe, 11%.

03:40:24.462 --> 03:40:29.148
According to information I have here from, I can't, who is this?

03:40:29.168 --> 03:40:31.511
Yeah, 14.8% for 17, 18 school years, is that about right?

03:40:31.551 --> 03:40:31.892
Yes, correct.

03:40:36.889 --> 03:40:39.490
And that's still below Fremont High School at 20.

03:40:40.090 --> 03:40:41.871
Think College now at 17.

03:40:42.391 --> 03:40:43.391
United for Success at 17.

03:40:44.031 --> 03:40:44.752
And Garfield at 16.

03:40:44.872 --> 03:40:46.072
It's still below that.

03:40:46.512 --> 03:40:48.013
But it has gone up three points.

03:40:48.093 --> 03:40:49.073
It started at 14-15.

03:40:49.233 --> 03:40:51.674
I mean, it started at 11% in the 14-15 school year.

03:40:51.694 --> 03:40:53.935
So that's the school where we started to do citywide recruitment.

03:40:53.955 --> 03:40:55.015
Can I finish my question?

03:40:55.295 --> 03:40:59.577
So for EPIC, was that based on a concerted plan that you had for recruiting students?

03:40:59.597 --> 03:40:59.677
Yes.

03:41:00.057 --> 03:41:12.952
And actually, our plan at EPIC primarily was recruiting African-American teachers and educators, so as to actually more accurate to what we heard from a lot of our black families when we asked, what would bring you to our schools?

03:41:12.992 --> 03:41:15.776
They said, we need to see more African-American educators.

03:41:16.116 --> 03:41:20.281
So at EPIC, there was a concerted effort to have more African-American teachers and leadership on staff.

03:41:20.541 --> 03:41:20.821
Okay.

03:41:21.841 --> 03:41:24.302
And so are you doing the same thing then at your other schools?

03:41:24.622 --> 03:41:34.746
The reason I'm asking is because I want, even though I understand, and I also understand the model that you are going to use in this lottery system tomorrow.

03:41:35.336 --> 03:41:39.657
when your charter is approved today, I need to understand.

03:41:40.237 --> 03:41:53.321
So when those slots don't fill up, because you don't have a really good track record right now of doing recruitment appropriately or correctly to bring in more African-American students, who's going to be filling in those other slots?

03:41:54.841 --> 03:41:55.901
I mean, I think that's a great question.

03:41:55.941 --> 03:41:58.062
It's one of the reasons we wanted to start really small.

03:41:58.362 --> 03:42:01.103
OK, when people answer one of my questions, that's a great question.

03:42:01.123 --> 03:42:02.203
It means they don't have an answer.

03:42:02.648 --> 03:42:07.229
Do you have an answer about what you're going to do to bring in more African-American students?

03:42:07.269 --> 03:42:16.572
I think I would say that, first of all, with the recruitment of Latitude this year, we were incredibly intentional in making sure that we hit every single middle school that would open their doors to us.

03:42:16.693 --> 03:42:20.334
And our applicant pool actually is reflective of the demographics of Oakland.

03:42:21.474 --> 03:42:23.075
So I think it's really being on the ground.

03:42:23.135 --> 03:42:30.258
It's really working closely with community organizers, working with local organizations that are serving African-American students and families.

03:42:30.338 --> 03:42:35.061
And we have done really intentional recruitment to really get at the diverse by design.

03:42:35.121 --> 03:42:37.042
For us, it's not just about a statistic.

03:42:37.302 --> 03:42:43.825
It's actually about the values that we have for our school and the community that we want to see students working together across difference.

03:42:43.885 --> 03:42:49.948
And so I think that our recruitment strategies this year really reflect that as reflected in the applicant pool of Latitude.

03:42:50.248 --> 03:42:56.851
Okay, so let me just say, and I probably should have said this before I began asking my questions to you.

03:42:57.311 --> 03:43:11.958
In the conversation, and I said this yesterday, you know, we're spending so much time in having the conversation about accountability and trying to quantify the performance of schools so that we have exact numbers that tell us that schools suck and that they're not doing well.

03:43:12.298 --> 03:43:14.919
But we're not having the conversation on what it means

03:43:15.299 --> 03:43:20.705
to actually improve the instructional program or the instructional experience of the students.

03:43:21.426 --> 03:43:32.760
It has also been my concern and my concerted effort in the time I have served on this board that when we talk in particular about students of color and African-American students and African-American boys in particular,

03:43:33.300 --> 03:43:39.586
We skip over the conversation about what you should be doing and what you should be doing better.

03:43:39.927 --> 03:43:44.511
And it's always, I'm going to do this, and I never see it come to fruition.

03:43:44.832 --> 03:43:48.736
So I have that concern about hearing what you say you're going to do.

03:43:49.076 --> 03:43:53.621
You've been in business for 13 years, and you haven't done nothing, to quote Stevie Wonder.

03:43:54.281 --> 03:44:07.838
So I have that concern, particularly about the African American students, that you have an entire community of people sitting there who are an overwhelming part of the population, and you haven't created a concerted effort to recruit these students.

03:44:07.878 --> 03:44:09.220
And frankly, I don't believe you.

03:44:09.560 --> 03:44:18.223
when you say this new lottery system is going to do better than for the schools you have existing right now and you haven't done enough to improve that.

03:44:18.523 --> 03:44:27.865
So I have, I'm not satisfied with what I heard and I believe five years from now when you come back because your petition is going to get approved today that your numbers are not going to look any better.

03:44:28.145 --> 03:44:33.167
But I challenge you to prove me wrong because for once I would like to be wrong but I'm not going to be.

03:44:33.447 --> 03:44:38.491
And absolutely, and I think what I would say is that it's not just about recruitment, it's about actually retaining the students.

03:44:38.591 --> 03:44:48.059
And what we believe we offer at Latitude is a program, is an instructional model that will actually serve African American students well so that they will sustain within our schools, right?

03:44:48.239 --> 03:44:52.163
So it's not just about the numbers of having students come in, it's about can you actually deliver?

03:44:52.983 --> 03:45:06.411
So I think that today we heard that only 39% of African-American students in OUSD are actually meeting the A through G requirements, which means that they're ineligible to even apply to A through G, to apply to four-year schools.

03:45:06.711 --> 03:45:12.755
I think that if ultimately what we're about is educational opportunity and educational outcomes, you need to look at the track record.

03:45:13.115 --> 03:45:16.437
and the track record of our founding team is that we are serving students well.

03:45:17.377 --> 03:45:24.421
81% of our African American Latino students from the school that I led, that our founding team led, graduated from a four-year university.

03:45:24.701 --> 03:45:32.986
It still doesn't change the fact that Oakland Unified School District still sends more African American students to the University of California than you have in the last 13 years.

03:45:33.746 --> 03:45:34.486
It still doesn't change.

03:45:34.546 --> 03:45:43.410
So I respectfully disagree, and I stand behind the fact that we offer a program that will serve students well and that will meet the needs that are currently being met.

03:45:43.610 --> 03:45:48.512
As I said, I want to be wrong, but I just have no doubt that I won't be proven wrong.

03:45:49.212 --> 03:45:52.474
We accept the challenge and hope to make you proud in five years.

03:45:52.894 --> 03:45:54.714
We're going to get Ortiz-Lacombe into this.

03:45:57.179 --> 03:45:57.459
Go ahead.

03:45:57.479 --> 03:46:00.580
I don't know if I need a drink, holy water, something has to happen here.

03:46:00.600 --> 03:46:06.861
I want to say, I want to compliment the petitioners for bringing a very well-articulated vision.

03:46:07.181 --> 03:46:18.564
And one of the things that I had to go back, because after I asked the question about performance, this is a new school, obviously doesn't have a track record, but it's part of a family, the charter management organization.

03:46:19.044 --> 03:46:22.725
So I had to go back to look at the dashboard.

03:46:23.505 --> 03:46:32.388
And to be honest, because your presentation was so well articulated and there was so much support, I was expecting to see a lot of greens and blues in your dashboard.

03:46:32.488 --> 03:46:34.188
And unfortunately, that's not what I'm seeing.

03:46:34.909 --> 03:46:42.171
And I'm looking specifically at English language arts, mathematics, digging down to the subgroup level.

03:46:42.991 --> 03:46:55.564
You admitted that it has been a bit of a challenge to recruit African American students, so there is no data for those students because it's under the end size of 30, which we wouldn't capture the data here on the dashboard.

03:46:56.104 --> 03:47:00.709
I think for English learner progress, there has been some success in some of the schools.

03:47:00.749 --> 03:47:04.293
I looked at Cox, I looked at Achieve, I looked at all of them.

03:47:04.953 --> 03:47:09.595
One of the things that also caught my attention is that there is no information for the local indicators.

03:47:09.836 --> 03:47:21.822
All of them says not met, which means that you either didn't submit the information or you simply are self-reflecting that you have not met implementation of academic standards, parent engagement, school climate.

03:47:22.762 --> 03:47:34.335
So now I'm conflicted because I'm looking at the data and the data doesn't show, doesn't kind of match the vision that I anticipated.

03:47:34.355 --> 03:47:40.702
You know, six schools, you kind of have the model down, you know how to serve these students that you're working with.

03:47:41.603 --> 03:47:45.306
And I see a lot of struggles and the same struggles that any other school would have, right?

03:47:46.387 --> 03:47:47.487
So that's where I'm at right now.

03:47:47.527 --> 03:47:51.210
I would want to know why you don't have data for your local indicators.

03:47:51.630 --> 03:47:52.711
Is it that it wasn't submit?

03:47:52.831 --> 03:47:53.492
None of the schools.

03:47:53.852 --> 03:47:55.413
I looked at every single one of the schools.

03:47:55.933 --> 03:47:57.875
None of them have any rating.

03:47:57.935 --> 03:48:02.978
So you're either being honest and saying we're not meeting the standard or you simply didn't submit.

03:48:04.700 --> 03:48:06.101
Yes, I'm calling you back to the podium.

03:48:06.141 --> 03:48:06.541
I'm sorry.

03:48:11.801 --> 03:48:17.120
So the local indicators, all of them say namit, namit, namit for every one of your schools.

03:48:17.795 --> 03:48:39.579
Yeah, no, I feel like I've just been caught with I just saw it on the website myself So we have local indicators and we submitted them as part of our LCAP and our reflection So we'll have to figure out why there's this disconnect But we we it's not that we didn't meet them or we reported that we didn't meet them Okay, but but the rest of the data is accurate, right?

03:48:39.639 --> 03:48:44.200
I mean you are struggling for none of your academic indicators anything above a

03:48:44.861 --> 03:48:47.904
color orange, everything's red, yellow, orange.

03:48:48.765 --> 03:48:53.330
Again, I think that one of the things that we acknowledge is that we are not where we want to be.

03:48:53.771 --> 03:48:59.117
We are an organization that this year invested and doubled down on a couple instructional initiatives.

03:48:59.438 --> 03:49:00.919
We call them instructional wins.

03:49:01.039 --> 03:49:03.002
What we saw across the board was

03:49:04.824 --> 03:49:07.627
a pretty significant increase in our student performance.

03:49:08.067 --> 03:49:18.039
That would make most of our schools, we're anticipating, obviously it's trickling in, but when we look at the dashboard with most of our data now, most of our schools will actually pop into yellow.

03:49:18.959 --> 03:49:23.980
And it will be epic math that remains in orange, but epic ELA back in yellow.

03:49:24.040 --> 03:49:31.341
Because most of the schools made something in the ballpark of we had schools make 10 to 15 point gains.

03:49:31.742 --> 03:49:34.622
And we had schools actually make 30 to 40 point gains as well.

03:49:35.022 --> 03:49:44.784
So we saw, with the average school making about 20 to 25 point gains, which then puts you on the far right for gains on the dashboard, on the five by five.

03:49:44.864 --> 03:49:48.046
And this is on the data that's not really been... Right.

03:49:48.086 --> 03:49:50.028
This is our preliminary data coming in.

03:49:50.048 --> 03:49:52.349
Pardon?

03:49:52.589 --> 03:49:53.610
They have the data.

03:49:54.671 --> 03:49:54.911
Right.

03:49:54.951 --> 03:49:58.553
But it is not in any dashboard that is on... It's not public yet.

03:49:58.593 --> 03:49:58.773
Yes.

03:49:58.833 --> 03:49:59.074
Yeah.

03:49:59.134 --> 03:50:01.615
It'll come out in... Yeah.

03:50:01.695 --> 03:50:02.916
These are very modest gains.

03:50:03.056 --> 03:50:03.176
Yes.

03:50:03.196 --> 03:50:03.937
They're not acceptable.

03:50:03.957 --> 03:50:04.397
I'm not... Yeah.

03:50:07.634 --> 03:50:13.078
So can I just ask the question, why not focus on these current schools before and try to get it right?

03:50:13.558 --> 03:50:18.501
So we made a decision to double down on instructional initiatives.

03:50:18.521 --> 03:50:20.943
And we actually did a lot of soul searching about latitude.

03:50:21.023 --> 03:50:24.345
And at some point, we had a conflicted board about latitude.

03:50:24.845 --> 03:50:27.467
And we wouldn't have opened latitude if this team hadn't shown up.

03:50:28.127 --> 03:50:29.508
We were sort of playing.

03:50:29.888 --> 03:50:31.668
The XQ Super Schools project happened.

03:50:31.688 --> 03:50:34.389
We kind of were playing on the side of submitting something.

03:50:34.409 --> 03:50:35.990
You know, $10 million gets thrown around.

03:50:36.030 --> 03:50:37.311
You say, hey, let's submit something.

03:50:37.651 --> 03:50:38.951
And we started dreaming a school.

03:50:39.071 --> 03:50:42.072
And then Lillian moved to Oakland.

03:50:42.192 --> 03:50:44.493
And she was actually in the sort of innovation space.

03:50:44.553 --> 03:50:45.114
And we met her.

03:50:45.154 --> 03:50:46.174
And she joined our team.

03:50:46.514 --> 03:50:49.095
And the next thing you know, she says, I'd really like to run this school.

03:50:50.256 --> 03:50:54.517
And at that point, I've been opening new schools in Oakland for about 15 years.

03:50:56.778 --> 03:51:08.541
One of the big learnings from opening new schools in Oakland, including EPIC, is that you have to have a rock star founding team, or it actually drains resource and time and energy from the CMO so that it gets distracted.

03:51:10.682 --> 03:51:13.203
When we looked at EPIC, we created a green lighting rubric.

03:51:13.643 --> 03:51:17.624
When we looked at Latitude, we created a green lighting rubric that looked radically different from the one we created for EPIC.

03:51:18.024 --> 03:51:21.386
It said, can this team, because we're not even a high school operator, right?

03:51:21.426 --> 03:51:32.051
So can this team actually come in and not only just be the high school unit and run it at high quality, but actually become a standard for the rest of us?

03:51:32.191 --> 03:51:36.313
Because the truth of the matter is, one of my big learnings in the past two years is,

03:51:38.078 --> 03:51:44.586
When you're working with high poverty communities, sometimes you get really, and I acknowledge, comfortable with not good enough.

03:51:45.167 --> 03:51:47.910
You start to celebrate mediocrity.

03:51:48.271 --> 03:51:54.018
This past year, I was gifted with an opportunity to travel across the country and look at best practices in the beauty of this common core.

03:51:54.498 --> 03:52:00.001
is that you can actually look at the SBAC and say, what are other places across the country that are killing us?

03:52:00.621 --> 03:52:04.504
In LA, in Houston, in New York, in Newark, who's killing us?

03:52:04.884 --> 03:52:10.367
And I went and got to observe tons of schools that are killing us, that are serving the same population.

03:52:10.707 --> 03:52:17.871
And very humbled, I came back with this crazy process of wins and said, we're only going to do a couple things.

03:52:17.891 --> 03:52:18.691
We're only doing instruction.

03:52:18.711 --> 03:52:19.612
We're not doing anything else.

03:52:20.652 --> 03:52:23.074
We're not going to focus on operations,

03:52:23.854 --> 03:52:25.394
beautification or culture.

03:52:25.414 --> 03:52:31.336
We're going to focus on improving early literacy, 3.5 problem solving, and 6.8 math.

03:52:31.436 --> 03:52:32.316
And we're going to double down.

03:52:32.356 --> 03:52:33.776
And anything else, don't talk to me about it.

03:52:34.957 --> 03:52:37.357
If staff survey data looks like a bummer, I don't care.

03:52:37.617 --> 03:52:39.338
I mean, it became very focused.

03:52:39.798 --> 03:52:44.659
And I hate to say that, but we get so distracted by all the initiatives and all the things that you could be doing.

03:52:45.119 --> 03:52:47.840
We don't have enough resource in the state to not prioritize.

03:52:48.200 --> 03:52:52.681
So when we prioritized, 80% of our kindergartners are going to first grade reading at grade level.

03:52:53.021 --> 03:52:55.643
Never happened before at EFC.

03:52:55.823 --> 03:52:57.804
That number makes me so happy.

03:52:57.824 --> 03:53:00.586
20% are in a summer program, so we can double down.

03:53:00.986 --> 03:53:02.988
If we never create a gap, you never have to close a gap.

03:53:03.768 --> 03:53:07.651
I focused the first couple years at EFC on an MTSS system.

03:53:07.911 --> 03:53:09.012
I partnered with Seneca.

03:53:09.432 --> 03:53:10.333
I was so proud of it.

03:53:10.713 --> 03:53:16.097
But creating an MTSS system and not focusing on core tier one instruction is a mistake.

03:53:17.057 --> 03:53:18.918
And I acknowledge that mistake.

03:53:19.079 --> 03:53:22.681
I have a great MTSS system, where more than half the kids need interventions.

03:53:22.781 --> 03:53:24.542
That's not an MTSS system at that point.

03:53:25.263 --> 03:53:28.425
So we are doubling down on core instruction in Tier 1.

03:53:28.885 --> 03:53:30.106
We are investing.

03:53:30.166 --> 03:53:31.487
We have recruited.

03:53:31.527 --> 03:53:33.509
We have picked really rigorous curricula.

03:53:33.529 --> 03:53:39.233
We have replicated the practices of the best schools in New Orleans, in Newark, in New Jersey, in LA.

03:53:39.293 --> 03:53:43.476
We went to Mission Prep in San Francisco because their outcomes were so much better than ours.

03:53:44.196 --> 03:53:48.318
We went to go see Acorn, Woodland, and OUSD because their outcomes were better than ours.

03:53:48.458 --> 03:53:51.840
We are approaching this as humble learners.

03:53:52.040 --> 03:53:53.601
I mean, we are not where we want to be.

03:53:53.621 --> 03:53:55.502
I appreciate the pushback.

03:53:55.702 --> 03:53:56.922
I'm obsessed with data.

03:53:57.423 --> 03:53:58.863
I'm embarrassed by our data.

03:53:58.923 --> 03:54:02.345
I hope that when you guys see our dashboard in August, you're like, oh, yeah, look at that.

03:54:02.985 --> 03:54:05.187
Look at the orange that shifted to yellows.

03:54:05.207 --> 03:54:07.268
And next year, I hope to be yellows that shift to greens.

03:54:08.268 --> 03:54:09.990
Three years, I helped to be beating the state.

03:54:11.591 --> 03:54:15.755
But I've been doing this for 25 years, and I didn't do it to get 50% or 25%.

03:54:16.395 --> 03:54:24.583
And at this point, I'm dedicating the next 13 years before I retire to 80% and 100% for the kids that I serve today.

03:54:25.735 --> 03:54:27.616
OK, well, thank you for that statement.

03:54:27.676 --> 03:54:30.316
I wish I heard that from more school administrators.

03:54:30.336 --> 03:54:31.917
Yes, yes.

03:54:32.197 --> 03:54:35.398
And this is a very, you know, your petition is very well prepared.

03:54:35.698 --> 03:54:39.139
And that's really what we're deciding on today.

03:54:39.339 --> 03:54:42.000
And I take all the feedback and the challenges very seriously.

03:54:42.120 --> 03:54:43.660
So I do hope to come back in five years.

03:54:43.880 --> 03:54:46.201
And thank you for letting me ask those questions.

03:54:46.341 --> 03:54:54.085
I would not have felt good about my work and myself as an African-American sitting in this dais without asking you those questions.

03:54:54.125 --> 03:54:57.247
So, you know, you may retire a little bit sooner than I do.

03:54:57.307 --> 03:55:02.650
So I'm hoping by the time, I'm not going to let you retire if you haven't met your promise you just made to me.

03:55:02.870 --> 03:55:03.450
Absolutely.

03:55:04.131 --> 03:55:04.451
Thank you.

03:55:06.164 --> 03:55:07.385
Okay.

03:55:07.545 --> 03:55:11.548
If there's no further discussion, I think we have a motion and it's seconded.

03:55:13.709 --> 03:55:14.110
Let's see.

03:55:14.210 --> 03:55:15.871
Why don't we start over there, Carl?

03:55:16.331 --> 03:55:18.713
Because we have a short board.

03:55:18.813 --> 03:55:21.715
I want to restate the motion so we know.

03:55:22.595 --> 03:55:32.042
The motion is to approve the CDE recommendation to authorize latitude and whatever conditions that usually comes with state board authorization.

03:55:35.980 --> 03:55:36.180
No.

03:55:37.681 --> 03:55:38.321
Aaron Valdez?

03:55:38.661 --> 03:55:38.821
Yes.

03:55:39.802 --> 03:55:41.083
Feliza Otis-Lacon?

03:55:41.183 --> 03:55:43.024
Abstain.

03:55:43.084 --> 03:55:43.524
Sue Burr?

03:55:43.705 --> 03:55:43.905
Yes.

03:55:45.005 --> 03:55:45.706
Eileen Strauss?

03:55:45.986 --> 03:55:46.206
Yes.

03:55:46.807 --> 03:55:47.407
Mike Kirst?

03:55:47.567 --> 03:55:47.847
Yes.

03:55:49.108 --> 03:55:49.728
Trish Williams?

03:55:49.748 --> 03:55:50.909
Yes.

03:55:50.929 --> 03:55:51.730
Nikki Sandoval?

03:55:53.391 --> 03:55:53.531
No.

03:55:53.931 --> 03:55:54.552
Jayden Gray?

03:55:54.572 --> 03:55:54.632
No.

03:55:55.732 --> 03:55:56.613
The motion passes.

03:55:57.013 --> 03:55:58.154
Okay, the motion passes.

03:55:58.194 --> 03:55:59.675
The charter school is authorized.

03:56:04.468 --> 03:56:08.971
Okay, now we're ready for item 24, general public comment.

03:56:09.031 --> 03:56:10.732
Do we have any general public comment?

03:56:11.012 --> 03:56:14.574
We have one person signed up, Solomon Guanakim.

03:56:23.839 --> 03:56:28.722
Okay, well, Solomon, can you repeat the, please speak loud.

03:56:28.882 --> 03:56:33.645
Would Solomon Guanakim please come to the podium for general public comment?

03:56:35.365 --> 03:56:39.507
Solomon, please come forward.

03:56:46.330 --> 03:56:46.870
Solomon.
