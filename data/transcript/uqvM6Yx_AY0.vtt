00:00.000 --> 00:06.280
Welcome, everyone, to our master class in data storytelling.

00:06.280 --> 00:12.880
We're very excited with the panel that will be presented and presenting in a few minutes.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.720
I will moderate the panel.

00:14.720 --> 00:23.100
My name is Haya Al Nasser and I work for the communications directorate at the Census Bureau,

00:23.100 --> 00:28.960
but I'm also the editor of America Counts, Stories Behind the Numbers, which is one of

00:28.960 --> 00:37.920
the more recent and successful product launches at the Census Bureau that deals with data

00:37.920 --> 00:40.040
storytelling all the way.

00:40.040 --> 00:45.540
So it was one of our more creative efforts of the past few years.

00:45.540 --> 00:49.640
So just to give you a little bit of background, I am a former journalist.

00:49.640 --> 00:57.080
I spent almost 20 years as the lead census and demographics reporter at USA Today and

00:57.120 --> 00:59.760
worked for Al Jazeera America after that.

00:59.760 --> 01:04.580
Once I left journalism and joined the Census Bureau, my mission was clear.

01:04.580 --> 01:11.520
It was to basically apply my journalistic experience to helping the Census Bureau communicate

01:11.520 --> 01:18.200
its data products in a more relatable way and to a broader audience.

01:18.200 --> 01:25.000
So in the fall of 2017, we launched a new content platform called America Counts.

01:25.000 --> 01:32.840
And I'm going to share my screen so I can show you the website and let me know if you

01:32.840 --> 01:33.840
can see it.

01:33.840 --> 01:38.840
It looks, can you see it?

01:38.840 --> 01:40.160
I assume you can see it.

01:40.160 --> 01:42.160
So here's the landing page.

01:42.160 --> 01:43.160
Not yet.

01:43.160 --> 01:44.160
Not yet.

01:44.160 --> 01:45.160
Not yet?

01:45.160 --> 01:46.160
Not yet.

01:46.160 --> 01:49.160
Please try again.

01:49.160 --> 01:52.600
Okay.

01:52.600 --> 01:57.760
You cannot share, it tells me.

01:57.760 --> 01:58.760
Why would that be?

01:58.760 --> 02:01.760
Let me see if this is going to work.

02:01.760 --> 02:06.760
Somebody can make you a co-host and then you can share.

02:06.760 --> 02:07.760
There we go.

02:07.760 --> 02:08.760
Now we can see.

02:08.760 --> 02:13.320
We can see it now.

02:13.320 --> 02:19.200
Now you're muted.

02:19.200 --> 02:29.520
Muted, Haya.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.960
Now it's, it's very strange.

02:31.960 --> 02:33.360
It won't let me unmute.

02:33.360 --> 02:37.600
So now let's hope it's still, now it's, is it going to be sharing?

02:37.600 --> 02:39.280
Yes, it's still sharing.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.280
Okay.

02:40.280 --> 02:41.280
So this is our website.

02:41.280 --> 02:50.840
So as you can see, we're, I've applied the news site model to the America Counts page.

02:50.840 --> 02:54.840
The top story is the most recent story we've published.

02:54.840 --> 03:01.540
And then at the bottom, you'll see in chronological descending order, all the other stories.

03:01.540 --> 03:05.520
So I just want to point out that when you look at all this content, well, we publish

03:05.520 --> 03:08.660
about two to three stories a week on average.

03:08.660 --> 03:14.040
When you look at all this, all of these stories began as probably a data file or an Excel

03:14.040 --> 03:20.660
spreadsheet, but we are telling stories through all the various components.

03:20.660 --> 03:26.300
The image tells a story, the headline tells a story, the teaser text tells a story.

03:26.300 --> 03:32.540
I'll open one of the pages just to give you an idea of some of the other components that

03:32.540 --> 03:35.700
we think are key in data storytelling.

03:35.700 --> 03:41.420
So here you have, we add the subhead, which again is another piece of the story.

03:41.420 --> 03:48.660
Please note that we are very conscious of keeping the writing clear and direct, short

03:48.660 --> 03:51.100
paragraphs.

03:51.100 --> 03:56.940
As you all know, most folks who read things online tend to be scrollers and scanners.

03:56.940 --> 04:02.540
If you have all this in one great text, they'll skip a lot of stuff in between.

04:03.260 --> 04:07.000
We also know that more and more people are reading things on their smartphones.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.740
If you put these two paragraphs together, it would probably fill up the screen, which

04:10.740 --> 04:13.260
makes it pretty unreadable.

04:13.260 --> 04:21.020
Other components are pullout, text, maps, section breaks, which are really important

04:21.020 --> 04:28.420
in organizing the story and making it more accessible to the readers, graphics, and so

04:28.420 --> 04:29.420
on.

04:29.500 --> 04:36.260
Again, I'm going to tell you really quickly, show you another data storytelling tool that

04:36.260 --> 04:37.820
we've used.

04:37.820 --> 04:39.340
Let's see if this loads.

04:39.340 --> 04:40.340
Okay.

04:40.340 --> 04:45.140
This is a story that we ran last spring, which was extremely popular.

04:45.140 --> 04:50.500
The story basically highlights interactive data visualization, which I will show you

04:50.500 --> 04:51.660
in a second.

04:51.660 --> 04:59.220
So again, strong headlines that tell the story, subhead that tells a story, all of this.

04:59.220 --> 05:01.540
The bullet points, all this.

05:01.540 --> 05:10.060
And then this takes you to the actual interactive data visualization, which was extremely popular.

05:10.060 --> 05:14.980
This allows you to compare teachers' pay with all other occupation.

05:14.980 --> 05:20.060
As you can see, you can drop the menu and pick any other occupation and compare what

05:20.060 --> 05:24.220
teachers are getting paid by educational level.

05:24.220 --> 05:31.380
And the interactive continues with more very appealing visuals.

05:31.380 --> 05:37.540
So I just wanted to give you a quick intro to some of the work that we are doing at the

05:37.540 --> 05:41.300
Census Bureau in the area of data storytelling.

05:41.300 --> 05:47.020
And I'm happy to report that it has been quite successful.

05:47.020 --> 05:54.660
We are nearing 12 million page visits since we launched in the fall of 2017.

05:54.660 --> 05:59.900
And we're growing at a faster rate than we added just 4 million of those visits, I believe

05:59.900 --> 06:01.740
just in the past year.

06:01.740 --> 06:06.420
So I'll just close with that and I'll make sure I put a link and my contact info in the

06:06.420 --> 06:07.420
chat.

06:07.420 --> 06:11.600
But let me go ahead and introduce our next speaker.

06:11.600 --> 06:16.740
And I assume I'm no longer sharing, right?

06:16.740 --> 06:17.740
So good.

06:17.740 --> 06:21.820
I can still see your screen.

06:21.820 --> 06:28.540
Some people don't see the screen, so perhaps change the view of your window when you click

06:28.540 --> 06:31.860
on the right-hand side, it says gallery side-by-side speaker.

06:31.860 --> 06:35.700
So for those that can't see, perhaps try to toggle your options.

06:35.700 --> 06:38.740
And now you're going to be seeing effective ways to use data.

06:38.740 --> 06:39.740
Okay.

06:39.740 --> 06:40.740
Then it's fine.

06:40.740 --> 06:41.740
Okay.

06:41.740 --> 06:42.740
Then we're good.

06:42.740 --> 06:48.140
So I'm going to go ahead and introduce our first speaker.

06:48.140 --> 06:54.380
Brent Dykes is the founder and chief data storyteller at Analytics Hero LLC.

06:54.380 --> 07:00.620
He's also the author of Effective Data Storytelling, How to Drive Change with Data, Narrative, and

07:00.620 --> 07:01.620
Visuals.

07:01.620 --> 07:07.500
Brent has nearly two decades of enterprise analytics experience at Omniture, Adobe, Domo,

07:07.500 --> 07:09.340
and Blast Analytics.

07:09.340 --> 07:14.420
His passion for data storytelling comes from consulting with many industry leaders, including

07:14.420 --> 07:18.420
Ikea, Nike, Microsoft, Sony, and Comcast.

07:18.420 --> 07:22.700
He's a regular Forbes contributor and has written more than 45 articles on different

07:22.700 --> 07:24.700
data-related topics.

07:24.700 --> 07:30.740
He's a popular speaker at conferences such as Strata, Web Summit, Shop.org, Ad Tech,

07:30.740 --> 07:36.780
PopCon, Rise, Crunch, and Adobe Summit, and of course today, the Top Summit.

07:36.780 --> 07:40.060
So Brent, take it away.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.060
Thank you, Hannah.

07:42.060 --> 07:47.820
I'm excited here to talk about effective ways to use data stories or data powerful data

07:47.820 --> 07:48.820
stories.

07:48.820 --> 07:53.460
So one of the things we may question whether we need more data, right?

07:53.460 --> 07:58.300
I think we're all have a lot of data that we're using today and in sharing that with

07:58.300 --> 08:00.300
other people, it can be overwhelming.

08:00.300 --> 08:05.120
But what everybody's really thirsty for, what they're really seeking are insights.

08:05.120 --> 08:07.520
And this is something that we really need to focus on.

08:07.520 --> 08:13.000
And I believe that if we look at an insight, it really needs to be at the core of every

08:13.000 --> 08:15.920
good data story or powerful data story.

08:15.920 --> 08:21.640
We need an insight, not just more data or more observations, but actually insights.

08:21.640 --> 08:25.440
Now when I was writing my book, I had some of my book reviewers when they're reading

08:25.440 --> 08:31.180
draft copies of my book, effective data storytelling, they mentioned, oh, well, you're using the

08:31.180 --> 08:34.800
word insight a lot, but you haven't really defined what it is.

08:34.840 --> 08:35.960
And so I was like, oh, yeah, sure.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.040
That's a great idea. I'll add that to the first chapter.

08:38.040 --> 08:42.880
And then when I went in and tried to decide, well, what is an insight, I realized that

08:42.880 --> 08:48.320
maybe I used that that term really loosely and didn't really have a good idea of what

08:48.320 --> 08:52.240
it really meant. And so I turned to the dictionaries, started looking at the dictionary,

08:52.240 --> 08:54.720
seeing what they kind of represented.

08:54.720 --> 08:59.840
And it didn't really resonate with me until somebody pointed me to this definition by

08:59.840 --> 09:02.280
Gary Klein, who's a psychologist and author.

09:02.680 --> 09:07.240
And he said that an insight is an unexpected shift in the way we understand things.

09:08.160 --> 09:13.000
Now, this is really important because I think what happens a lot of the time is we have

09:13.000 --> 09:17.320
an observation in the data, we find something interesting, maybe an interesting trend or

09:17.520 --> 09:20.560
anomaly or something like that, and we call that an insight.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.520
But really, that's not an insight.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.040
So let me give you an example here.

09:24.040 --> 09:28.880
So maybe we're looking at some data here and we see high speed Internet access grew by

09:28.920 --> 09:31.560
23 percent in our state last year.

09:31.560 --> 09:37.800
And that that may be surprising or unexpected, but really, that's just what it doesn't

09:37.800 --> 09:40.120
really get into the why. What what drove that?

09:40.560 --> 09:44.520
And so if we dig in a little bit further, we might discover something interesting,

09:45.280 --> 09:47.080
something that shifts our understanding.

09:47.080 --> 09:51.920
In this case, the 80 percent of this increase came from a local government initiative to

09:51.920 --> 09:54.160
expand access for low income families.

09:54.640 --> 09:58.760
And so with that insight, we have something now that we can do something with.

09:59.360 --> 10:03.800
Now, when we analyze the data, we go through it, we find something interesting, we find

10:03.800 --> 10:09.720
an insight and the numbers are so clear to us, they're so compelling.

10:10.200 --> 10:13.040
And we say that the numbers speak for themselves.

10:13.240 --> 10:15.840
And so we share that out with other people.

10:15.840 --> 10:19.920
And what happens, though, is that the numbers don't speak for themselves.

10:19.920 --> 10:23.520
What happens is they really do need a data storyteller.

10:23.520 --> 10:28.480
They need a narrator, need somebody to really explain what those insights mean

10:28.800 --> 10:30.520
and help people to understand them.

10:31.240 --> 10:35.520
So when I look at data storytelling, there are really three key elements that I focus

10:35.520 --> 10:39.200
on, probably no surprise, because probably before this presentation would have said,

10:39.200 --> 10:41.320
oh, yeah, data, narrative and visuals.

10:41.680 --> 10:46.560
But I think the power of data storytelling really comes in when we look at the

10:46.560 --> 10:48.000
intersections of these bubbles.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.720
Now, the first thing is I could do some analysis, I could find an insight and I could

10:51.720 --> 10:53.120
share a spreadsheet with you.

10:53.600 --> 10:57.480
And you could look at that same spreadsheet and say, I don't understand what you're

10:57.480 --> 10:59.640
sharing with me, Brian, I don't see any insight here.

10:59.640 --> 11:03.480
Or maybe you see a different insight or maybe you misinterpret the insight that I'm

11:03.480 --> 11:06.040
sharing. And so we we don't do that.

11:06.040 --> 11:10.640
What we do is we combine the narrative with the data to help make sure that the

11:10.640 --> 11:15.200
information is clear, that it's concrete and that we're explaining the numbers to the

11:15.200 --> 11:19.040
audience so they can really understand it and come away with the same insight that we

11:19.040 --> 11:24.000
get. Another thing we do is we use visuals because sometimes if we look at that table

11:24.000 --> 11:27.480
of data, there's a good chance that we're not going to see the anomalies, we're not

11:27.480 --> 11:29.760
going to see the patterns or trends in the numbers.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.400
And it's only when the numbers are visualized that we can actually enlighten the

11:34.400 --> 11:37.840
audience to these key findings that we have in our data.

11:38.720 --> 11:43.560
And the last intersection here that I want to focus on is between the visuals and the

11:43.560 --> 11:48.640
narrative. Now, one of the things we do as human beings is we love to hear stories,

11:48.800 --> 11:54.480
they engage us at a very deep level and especially the visual storytelling.

11:54.840 --> 11:59.920
We may have been up binge watching our favorite show on Netflix or Amazon Prime.

12:01.120 --> 12:05.680
So the interesting thing is when we bring the right data, we combine it with the right

12:05.680 --> 12:10.000
narrative and the right visuals, all of a sudden we have something that's very powerful,

12:10.000 --> 12:14.600
that can change the way people view the world, can change how they behave and what

12:14.600 --> 12:17.400
actions they take. So this is very powerful.

12:17.880 --> 12:22.600
Now, the interesting thing that you might be surprised to hear from a data guy is that

12:22.600 --> 12:24.160
stories beat statistics.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.120
You know, this is this is very interesting.

12:27.120 --> 12:32.720
I like this quote by Robert McKee, who he trains a lot of the script writers in

12:32.720 --> 12:36.760
Hollywood. And he said that storytelling is one of the most powerful ways to put ideas

12:36.760 --> 12:39.160
in the world today. And the same goes for insights.

12:39.560 --> 12:44.040
Now, let's look at the differences between stories and statistics.

12:44.040 --> 12:46.440
There's two ways that stories beat statistics.

12:46.440 --> 12:50.600
And these both come from a great book written by Chip and Dan Heath, if you're familiar

12:50.600 --> 12:53.480
with it, Made to Stick. It's on communication.

12:53.480 --> 12:58.400
And in that book, Chip Heath, who is a professor at Stanford University, shares how

12:58.880 --> 13:03.240
stories are more memorable. And he shares an example of an activity that he does with

13:03.360 --> 13:07.960
an undergrad class of communication students, where he gives them a bunch of data on a

13:07.960 --> 13:13.280
particular topic and asks them to incorporate the data or statistics into their

13:13.280 --> 13:15.960
presentations. And they create these short presentations.

13:16.240 --> 13:20.000
On average, the students are using about two and a half statistics in these

13:20.120 --> 13:25.120
presentations. And the other interesting side note is one in ten of these students

13:25.120 --> 13:29.880
will actually include an anecdote, a short anecdote in their presentations.

13:30.320 --> 13:33.800
So they go through this exercise, they divide up into groups, they present to each

13:33.800 --> 13:36.520
other, they rate each other and give feedback.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.920
And they think the activity is over.

13:39.320 --> 13:43.840
But about 10 minutes later, the professor comes back to them and says, OK, how many

13:43.840 --> 13:45.840
of these statistics do you actually remember?

13:46.480 --> 13:49.840
And the interesting thing that only about five percent of them could remember any

13:49.840 --> 13:54.520
statistics, but 63 percent of them could remember the stories.

13:54.520 --> 13:59.600
And so our human brains, when we try to make sense of the world around us, we're

13:59.600 --> 14:03.920
trying to put things into stories or trying to make sense of this world.

14:03.920 --> 14:08.360
And so stories make our information more memorable.

14:09.760 --> 14:12.720
The next thing is, is that stories are more persuasive.

14:12.720 --> 14:16.760
And so the example in the book that they share is a study from Carnegie Mellon

14:16.800 --> 14:21.040
University where students were asked to take a technology survey.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.240
And at the end of that survey, they were given five one dollar bills.

14:24.600 --> 14:28.240
And then they were asked if they'd like to donate some of that money to a local

14:28.240 --> 14:31.760
charity. And this charity was Save the Children.

14:32.200 --> 14:37.800
And so they gave them two brochures on this charity and one version of this

14:37.800 --> 14:43.080
brochure talked about all of the suffering of children in Africa and how,

14:43.400 --> 14:49.760
you know, due to illness or war or famine and shared lots of data and statistics

14:49.760 --> 14:52.480
on the number of children that are being impacted.

14:53.520 --> 14:56.760
So that was one version. The other version didn't include any data.

14:56.760 --> 15:00.440
It basically just talked about the story of Rukia, a seven year old girl from

15:00.440 --> 15:04.360
Bali and talked about the suffering of her family and what they went through.

15:04.760 --> 15:09.200
And when they looked at the average donations for both versions, they found

15:09.200 --> 15:14.680
that the story version generated a much higher average donation than the

15:14.680 --> 15:20.560
statistics did. So for these two reasons, it's really important that we take our

15:20.560 --> 15:23.960
data and let's work it weave it into stories.

15:24.600 --> 15:28.400
I like to say that we hear statistics, but we feel stories.

15:28.400 --> 15:32.640
And so when neuroscientists look at our brains, we hear facts being shared with

15:32.640 --> 15:36.040
us. There's a couple of regions of our brain that light up and they're strictly

15:36.400 --> 15:38.720
associated with processing language.

15:39.120 --> 15:44.120
However, when somebody hears a story or sharing a story and they they look at the

15:44.120 --> 15:46.720
brain, they see other regions of the brain light up.

15:46.720 --> 15:51.160
And that's because they're not only are they experienced or hearing what the

15:51.160 --> 15:53.680
people are saying, they're also experiencing it as well.

15:53.680 --> 15:58.440
So it's a much more deeper connection when you're telling a story as opposed to

15:58.440 --> 15:59.600
just sharing facts.

15:59.600 --> 16:03.320
Another thing that's interesting about sharing facts is that how we receive them,

16:03.320 --> 16:06.440
right? When we have information that's shared with us that maybe conflicts with

16:06.440 --> 16:09.280
our worldview, we're going to go into defensive mode.

16:09.280 --> 16:13.280
Our shields are going to come up and we're going to come much more critical and

16:13.280 --> 16:14.880
skeptical of this information.

16:15.400 --> 16:20.480
However, when we are approached with a story, all of a sudden, our shields come

16:20.480 --> 16:22.480
down. We drop that analytical guard.

16:22.480 --> 16:25.680
We're not likely not as likely to nitpick on the details.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.560
We want to see where the story goes.

16:27.600 --> 16:32.600
And so this opens an opportunity for us to convey our information in a way that's

16:32.600 --> 16:34.080
going to resonate with people.

16:34.400 --> 16:35.800
I like to look at it this way.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.840
We have all this evidence that we have.

16:37.840 --> 16:41.240
We have the data, which really speaks to the logical side.

16:41.240 --> 16:43.760
But a lot of the time, decisions are being made by emotion.

16:44.160 --> 16:49.640
And the story is what enables us to connect with that emotion that that goes into a

16:49.640 --> 16:50.640
lot of decision making.

16:51.640 --> 16:56.640
So today, I want to give you three quick tips on how to turn your information into

16:56.680 --> 16:57.680
powerful data stories.

16:58.680 --> 17:03.680
The first one, and I think this is important, is that we need to match the narrative to

17:03.680 --> 17:04.680
the audience, right?

17:04.680 --> 17:05.680
So here's the same story.

17:06.680 --> 17:09.680
This is the story of Robin Hood told multiple different ways.

17:10.680 --> 17:15.680
And if I were holding a birthday party for six year olds, I probably couldn't use the

17:15.680 --> 17:17.680
four on the right without getting in trouble with the parents.

17:18.680 --> 17:20.680
The one on the left, maybe the kids would get bored.

17:21.680 --> 17:23.680
And so really, I need to focus on that Disney one.

17:23.720 --> 17:28.720
Now, if it was a different audience, maybe maybe it's 16 year olds or 30 year olds, I'm

17:28.720 --> 17:29.720
going to choose a different one.

17:30.720 --> 17:34.720
And so it's really important that when we look at our data story, we need to determine

17:34.720 --> 17:40.720
who the right audience is for our story, or we mean to look at, you know, adjusting our

17:40.720 --> 17:43.720
data story to the audience that we're sharing it with.

17:45.720 --> 17:47.720
The second tip is how do we apply?

17:47.720 --> 17:50.720
Can we apply a narrative structure to our findings?

17:50.760 --> 17:54.760
So when I was researching for my book, I found I was looking at different models and I came

17:54.760 --> 17:59.760
across Gustav Freytag, who was a German playwright, who he studied, like Shakespearean

17:59.760 --> 18:01.760
plays and Greek tragedies.

18:02.760 --> 18:05.760
And he defined, he identified that they all had a story arc.

18:06.760 --> 18:09.760
And I've taken that story arc and I've applied it to data storytelling.

18:09.760 --> 18:14.760
We can take the same approach, just like a story that sets the scene for the for the

18:14.760 --> 18:16.760
characters and the story that they're about to tell.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.800
We can do the same thing with our data storytelling.

18:18.800 --> 18:23.800
You want to establish what are the expected trends that we typically see, you know, giving

18:23.800 --> 18:26.800
background on what is this data that we're looking at.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.800
And then we have a hook.

18:28.800 --> 18:32.800
And the hook is really where there's something that that's unusual and observation.

18:32.800 --> 18:33.800
Something's changed.

18:33.800 --> 18:38.800
Maybe a metric went up sharply or down significantly, and that caught our attention and

18:38.800 --> 18:42.800
that would capture the the attention of the audience as well.

18:42.840 --> 18:45.840
And then from there, we dig into, well, why did that occur?

18:45.840 --> 18:46.840
What's going on?

18:46.840 --> 18:47.840
What caused that?

18:47.840 --> 18:53.840
And so we have rising insights that start to build up to our aha moment, which is our

18:53.840 --> 18:58.840
main insight that we're sharing, our major finding, our central insight that we want

18:58.840 --> 18:59.840
the audience to remember.

18:59.840 --> 19:03.840
Now, we're not done at that point because we want the audience to do something.

19:03.840 --> 19:08.840
And that's where, you know, we're recommending either a solution or we're recommending

19:08.880 --> 19:14.880
And that's where, you know, we're recommending either a solution or we're showing different

19:14.880 --> 19:16.880
options and discussing the next steps.

19:16.880 --> 19:22.880
And through this process, the audience is learning more about this topic and hopefully

19:22.880 --> 19:26.880
they're putting they're being put into a position to act on it and make decisions.

19:26.880 --> 19:28.880
Now, how do we do this?

19:28.880 --> 19:31.880
I'll give you an example here from a real world example.

19:31.880 --> 19:35.880
And this was based on a retailer that had its analytics team, and they were looking

19:35.920 --> 19:38.920
at their customer data, the transactions.

19:38.920 --> 19:43.920
And so the the analytics team was expecting to see something like this, you know, a normal

19:43.920 --> 19:46.920
standard distribution of their orders by size.

19:46.920 --> 19:49.920
And what they found was this.

19:49.920 --> 19:52.920
There was this second peak that surprised them.

19:52.920 --> 19:53.920
They weren't expecting that.

19:53.920 --> 19:55.920
That was unexpected.

19:55.920 --> 19:59.920
And again, that's not an insight by itself until they dig into it to find out what was

19:59.920 --> 20:01.920
causing the second peak.

20:01.960 --> 20:05.960
When they did, they discovered that there was a segment of customers that were coming

20:05.960 --> 20:08.960
into their physical stores from outside the country.

20:08.960 --> 20:13.960
This retailer only had a presence in the United States and didn't have any stores outside

20:13.960 --> 20:14.960
of the United States.

20:14.960 --> 20:19.960
And international buyers were coming into their physical stores, making large bulk

20:19.960 --> 20:24.960
purchases and taking it back to their home countries to sell in their own stores.

20:24.960 --> 20:29.960
And then from there, they were able to make recommendations about maybe how they expand

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
into these countries, how maybe they partner with some of these resellers.

20:34.000 --> 20:39.000
And what you're seeing here is the taking those findings of an analysis and turning

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
it into a data story that can be shared, that's persuasive and memorable and engaging.

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
The next tip that we have is obviously we have a lot of data and we want to use the

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
visuals to amplify our messages.

20:52.000 --> 20:57.000
So in this case here, we're looking at COVID testing 2021, 2020 for various regions.

20:57.040 --> 21:00.040
And this chart is good.

21:00.040 --> 21:02.040
I mean, it's definitely sharing the data.

21:02.040 --> 21:05.040
You know, obviously we can look at it and see the insights.

21:05.040 --> 21:08.040
Now, the question is, maybe there's a better chart out there.

21:08.040 --> 21:12.040
Often what I recommend is iterating until you find a chart that really amplifies your

21:12.040 --> 21:13.040
message.

21:13.040 --> 21:15.040
In this case, maybe we want to go with a different chart.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.040
This is a slope graph chart.

21:17.040 --> 21:22.040
And in this case here, the angle of the slopes indicate, you know, if something growing or

21:22.080 --> 21:27.080
has increased significantly, you're going to see a sharper slope there than maybe the

21:27.080 --> 21:30.080
ones that are just wasn't much change.

21:30.080 --> 21:34.080
You know, you're not going to see as sharp an angle, pretty flat or decreasing.

21:34.080 --> 21:39.080
And so in this case here, maybe this chart is more effective than the one on the left.

21:39.080 --> 21:43.080
Another thing we can do is we can use color to really bring out our key points, right?

21:43.080 --> 21:48.080
So in this case here, we want to focus the audience's attention on region B, where we

21:48.120 --> 21:53.120
had this massive increase in COVID tests that grew 18% far and above any other region.

21:56.120 --> 22:01.120
And then finally, another thing that we can do is we can take that generic descriptive

22:01.120 --> 22:06.120
title and we can turn it into something where we have an explanatory headline or title

22:06.120 --> 22:11.120
that's really going to draw the attention of the audience to the key point that we're

22:11.120 --> 22:14.120
trying to make about region B.

22:14.160 --> 22:19.160
And so that ends my, I want to conclude my presentation with this quote from Stephen

22:19.160 --> 22:24.160
Few, you know, that the numbers have an important story to tell and they rely on you to

22:24.160 --> 22:26.160
give them a clear and convincing voice.

22:26.160 --> 22:31.160
And if you'd like to learn more about my philosophies on data storytelling, please check

22:31.160 --> 22:34.160
out my book, Effective Data Storytelling.

22:36.160 --> 22:37.160
Thank you, Brent.

22:37.160 --> 22:39.160
That was fantastic.

22:39.160 --> 22:40.160
Really appreciate it.

22:40.200 --> 22:45.200
I'm going to introduce our next speaker, who's a former colleague of mine, by the

22:45.200 --> 22:46.200
way.

22:46.200 --> 22:52.200
Lam Thuy Vo is a journalist who marries data analysis with underground reporting to

22:52.200 --> 22:56.200
examine how systems and policies affect individuals.

22:56.200 --> 23:02.200
She's currently a Soros Justice Fellow and AI Accountability Fellow for the Pulitzer

23:02.200 --> 23:07.200
Center and a data journalist and residence at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of

23:07.200 --> 23:08.200
Journalism.

23:08.240 --> 23:13.240
She has worked with Documented, ProPublica, The Guardian, The New York Times, and ESPN

23:13.240 --> 23:15.240
as an independent reporter.

23:15.240 --> 23:20.240
Previously, she was a journalist at BuzzFeed News, The Wall Street Journal, Al Jazeera

23:20.240 --> 23:23.240
America, and NPR's Planet Money.

23:23.240 --> 23:24.240
Lam?

23:26.240 --> 23:27.240
Hi, everyone.

23:27.240 --> 23:30.240
My name is Lam, and I'm very excited to see who is in the house.

23:30.240 --> 23:32.240
I've been seeing some of the bios I've been reading.

23:32.240 --> 23:35.240
I love how many folks I hear from Puerto Rico.

23:35.280 --> 23:40.280
I think there are a lot of stories that you can do in Puerto Rico using Census data, but

23:40.280 --> 23:46.280
I am particularly excited to nerd out about data when it comes to the Census Bureau

23:46.280 --> 23:47.280
because I use it so much.

23:47.280 --> 23:54.280
And one of the things I will start doing is I have already put into the Slack site, into

23:54.280 --> 23:59.280
the chat, the links to my slides.

23:59.320 --> 24:06.320
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to share my, I think, desktop, which you will

24:06.320 --> 24:11.320
see is catastrophically overly, I have too many links and everything, but if there's

24:11.320 --> 24:15.320
one thing that you will take away from today, I would like for you to take a screenshot

24:15.320 --> 24:22.320
right now, yes, of my desktop, but you'll also see the link here.

24:22.320 --> 24:26.320
All you need to get in touch with me, to look at the things that are on these slides, are

24:26.360 --> 24:27.360
on that link, right?

24:27.360 --> 24:28.360
So go for that.

24:28.360 --> 24:31.360
You can also find me on Twitter and you'll find that afterwards as well.

24:31.360 --> 24:36.360
So I am so excited to talk about Census data today because I am a nerd.

24:36.360 --> 24:41.360
I love the American Community Survey and other surveys that the Census Bureau puts out.

24:41.360 --> 24:47.360
This is me in, I think, 2018 filling out an American Community Survey with so much pride.

24:47.360 --> 24:48.360
This is why I'm here.

24:48.360 --> 24:53.360
I cannot tell you that I even texted my partner as soon as I was told to speak to me.

24:53.400 --> 24:58.400
I even texted my partner as soon as I was told to speak to the Census Bureau, for the

24:58.400 --> 25:03.400
Census Bureau, and I can attest to you that this data is extremely important.

25:03.400 --> 25:08.400
So to give you a quick understanding of who I am, maybe it helps you to understand the

25:08.400 --> 25:11.400
context through which I'm talking to you about today.

25:11.400 --> 25:14.400
I used to be a videographer for the Wall Street Journal.

25:14.400 --> 25:16.400
I was a data vis and video person for NPR.

25:16.400 --> 25:19.400
I was an interactive editor for Al Jazeera America.

25:19.440 --> 25:25.440
In all of those jobs as a journalist with multiple media, Census data at some point

25:25.440 --> 25:29.440
played a role in how I viewed the stories I was doing.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.440
Then I became a BuzzFeed reporter.

25:31.440 --> 25:36.440
The story we're going to talk about today is from BuzzFeed where I looked into basically

25:36.440 --> 25:41.440
any kinds of stories that were du jour at that point in time, identifying news trends

25:41.440 --> 25:46.440
and then figuring out ways to tell those stories in multiple platforms and using different

25:46.440 --> 25:48.440
types of data.

25:48.480 --> 25:52.480
And now I'm a data journalist in residence at CUNY where I teach these things.

25:52.480 --> 25:54.480
I've been teaching data journalism for a good decade.

25:54.480 --> 25:59.480
So if you have any questions in that small corner, you can see my email address.

25:59.480 --> 26:03.480
I tell my students I come with a lifetime guarantee, which is probably bad for my social

26:03.480 --> 26:06.480
life, but most people don't seem to email me, so you have that.

26:06.480 --> 26:10.480
And you can also find me on Twitter under the handle Alam Tuivo.

26:10.480 --> 26:15.480
So with all of that out of the way, I want to talk to you about a sample story today.

26:15.520 --> 26:23.520
And I want to walk you through how you can use census data in a way that might not seem

26:23.520 --> 26:25.520
as intuitive.

26:25.520 --> 26:33.520
In my capacity as a reporter, I used to be a general assignment reporter, but in my capacity

26:33.520 --> 26:38.520
as a reporter, I at that point in time was doing a lot of social media data listening.

26:38.520 --> 26:44.520
And what I found in 2018, we're going to walk through a story today that addresses the

26:44.560 --> 26:50.560
idea of that was formulated when people started looking into viral incidences around

26:50.560 --> 26:55.560
white folks in a neighborhood calling the cops and black and brown folks for doing

26:55.560 --> 26:57.560
seemingly very normal things.

26:57.560 --> 27:04.560
If anyone of you remembers in 2018, there were several incidents that went viral,

27:04.560 --> 27:10.560
including one about Barbecue Becky, a woman who called the cops on her black neighbors

27:10.600 --> 27:15.600
who were having a barbecue at the park saying that they weren't using a permit to do so.

27:15.600 --> 27:18.600
There was a woman called Permit Patty.

27:18.600 --> 27:23.600
If you remember them, this person was calling the cops on a, I think it was a Latino child

27:23.600 --> 27:25.600
who was selling water without a permit.

27:25.600 --> 27:30.600
And these incidents kept on going viral at that point in time.

27:30.600 --> 27:35.600
And one of the things that my editor and I wanted to do at that point in time in 2018

27:35.640 --> 27:40.640
was to better understand the hypothesis that all of these folks were formulating

27:40.640 --> 27:43.640
by making these stories go viral.

27:43.640 --> 27:49.640
So with this said, the hypothesis, it seemed to be looking at the conversation around

27:49.640 --> 27:54.640
these topics, looking at this particular, the particular stories around it was that

27:54.640 --> 27:59.640
white folks who move into gentrifying neighborhoods might be calling the cops on their black

27:59.640 --> 28:02.640
and brown neighbors more often, which leads to over-policing.

28:02.680 --> 28:04.680
And this was an interesting story to tackle.

28:04.680 --> 28:06.680
It was A, very controversial.

28:06.680 --> 28:10.680
It was B, also something that was kind of hard to prove.

28:10.680 --> 28:15.680
And so one of the things that we wanted to do, my editor and I, was to come up with better

28:15.680 --> 28:21.680
ideas of understanding how we can tackle this statistically so that we can go from having

28:21.680 --> 28:27.680
anecdotal viral conversations about a topic to one that is more informed by hypothesis

28:27.720 --> 28:32.720
building, data analysis, and then figuring out whether this was actually something that

28:32.720 --> 28:35.720
was, that we could prove statistically to some degree.

28:35.720 --> 28:40.720
And one of the reasons why I'm fascinated by this is that it taps into a power dynamic

28:40.720 --> 28:45.720
that is very much something that we have observed ever since then in many gentrifying

28:45.720 --> 28:52.720
neighborhoods where sometimes more affluent new residents seem to have a disproportionate

28:52.760 --> 28:57.760
amount of power over long-term residents who in the end get displaced from their neighborhoods.

28:57.760 --> 29:02.760
So with this said, one of the things that we wanted to do was to find a trend for this

29:02.760 --> 29:04.760
hypothesis.

29:04.760 --> 29:10.760
What's interesting is that what we needed to figure out was to find two to three different

29:10.760 --> 29:13.760
measurements based on that hypothesis, right?

29:13.760 --> 29:19.760
If the hypothesis is, as I remind you, if more white folks move into, who are more affluent

29:19.800 --> 29:24.800
move into gentrifying neighborhoods, there will be more calls to the cops, which may

29:24.800 --> 29:26.800
lead to over-policing.

29:26.800 --> 29:31.800
And one of the things that we needed to measure with that was gentrification, demographic

29:31.800 --> 29:34.800
changes, and then also calls to the police.

29:34.800 --> 29:38.800
And the three data sources that we used for that were 311 calls.

29:38.800 --> 29:45.800
So 311 calls are the types of quality of life complaints that go to a city's hotline.

29:45.840 --> 29:50.840
And then from that hotline, the city can connect you to different people.

29:50.840 --> 29:51.840
This data is open.

29:51.840 --> 29:52.840
This data is out there.

29:52.840 --> 29:57.840
I think at that point in time, we were looking at 17 million rows of data, and we were able

29:57.840 --> 30:02.840
to work with analyses that other folks had done before to better understand what of this

30:02.840 --> 30:07.840
data set would constitute calling the cops on your neighbors.

30:07.840 --> 30:12.840
The second thing that we needed to do was to find a trend for this hypothesis.

30:12.880 --> 30:17.880
And this is where ACS, or American Community Survey, data came in really strong.

30:17.880 --> 30:23.880
We used census data to look into census tracts all over New York City that went from being

30:23.880 --> 30:30.880
some of the poorest, so in the bottom 40th percentile, if that makes any sense to you,

30:30.880 --> 30:35.880
to one of the more affluent census tracts as compared to the region.

30:35.880 --> 30:40.880
We also looked at census tracts that went from being the poorest, so in the bottom 40th

30:40.920 --> 30:41.920
as compared to the region.

30:41.920 --> 30:48.920
We also looked at that from a stance of median home value and median income, as well as

30:48.920 --> 30:54.920
understanding whether there may be more folks, and this was an analysis done by Columbia

30:54.920 --> 30:59.920
and then later by another magazine, if there may have also been an increase of people who

30:59.920 --> 31:03.920
were 25 and older and had a bachelor's degree.

31:03.920 --> 31:09.920
All of those tests, so to speak, were academic tests that someone did to figure out

31:09.960 --> 31:17.960
whether a census tract, which is a small geographic location, the smallest sort of like

31:17.960 --> 31:23.960
one of the smallest divisions of a geographic area had gentrified, had gone from not so

31:23.960 --> 31:25.960
affluent to more affluent.

31:25.960 --> 31:28.960
That was one analysis we did.

31:28.960 --> 31:33.960
We looked into whether it was correlated to the calls to cops about noise and about other

31:33.960 --> 31:37.960
things that you found bothersome about your neighbors.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
And then we also looked into demographic changes.

31:41.000 --> 31:49.000
Now, this is a very convoluted and very boring way of saying the hypothesis that many people

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
on the Internet were formulating seemed to statistically check out.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
This graphic shows you that.

31:55.000 --> 32:02.000
And for that, we were able to use ACS data to do a larger statistical study to see whether

32:02.000 --> 32:07.000
there is a correlation between gentrification and calling the cops on your neighbors.

32:07.040 --> 32:12.040
And what we also saw, thanks to the census data, was that in the neighborhoods where

32:12.040 --> 32:18.040
there was a gentrified, where there was a higher rate per capita of calling the cops,

32:18.040 --> 32:20.040
we also saw demographic changes.

32:20.040 --> 32:26.040
This is a sort of convoluted chart that kind of makes that point of showing that in gentrifying

32:26.040 --> 32:31.040
neighborhoods where the calls were higher per capita to cops about noise complaints

32:31.040 --> 32:35.040
and other complaints about your neighbors, there were also major demographic changes.

32:35.080 --> 32:39.080
You could see that there were demographic changes in terms of more white folks moving

32:39.080 --> 32:46.080
in and fewer Black folks living in that neighborhood as a percentage of the entire neighborhood.

32:47.080 --> 32:52.080
So I've now explained to you how we went from looking at viral incidents to doing

32:52.080 --> 32:58.080
statistical analyses with the ACS to them being like, oh, the hypothesis that all of

32:58.080 --> 33:02.080
these folks on the Internet were kind of like speaking about, that seems to check out.

33:02.120 --> 33:07.120
And trust me, I've done enough to try and disprove my hypothesis, to try and disprove

33:07.120 --> 33:08.120
this hypothesis.

33:08.120 --> 33:12.120
This is a very controversial subject, so I wanted to make sure that it was extra right.

33:12.120 --> 33:13.120
And we were able to prove that.

33:13.120 --> 33:18.120
And what you can see is also that in a visual sense, one of the ways in which we showed

33:18.120 --> 33:24.120
this map is the tracks that are outlined, our census tracks that gentrified.

33:24.120 --> 33:30.120
The error up meant that the white population as a percentage of that neighborhood went

33:30.160 --> 33:31.160
up.

33:31.160 --> 33:38.160
And the darker the shade of each census track, the higher the calls per capita were to complain

33:38.160 --> 33:43.160
about noise, to complain about, quote unquote, illegal usage of an apartment.

33:44.160 --> 33:47.160
So this very clearly shows certain trends.

33:47.160 --> 33:52.160
But I can tell you all these things and I can make you feel like this is really important.

33:52.160 --> 33:56.160
But one of the things that's really important as well is to kind of bring that data and

33:56.200 --> 34:01.200
bring these findings down to a more visceral understanding of the subject.

34:01.200 --> 34:05.200
And so what we did for that story as well was to look into one block.

34:05.200 --> 34:11.200
What are interesting outliers, or not outliers, what are extreme versions or good emblematic

34:11.200 --> 34:14.200
examples of how this may manifest itself?

34:14.200 --> 34:20.200
And we found one block in Harlem, which was predominantly Dominican, where there were

34:20.200 --> 34:23.200
3,000 noise complaints over the course of three years.

34:23.240 --> 34:28.240
And as you can see here in this little data visualization, you can see that one address

34:28.240 --> 34:33.240
had 1,118 noise complaints lobbed against it between 2015 and 2017.

34:33.240 --> 34:36.240
And this kind of brings it down to a block level.

34:36.240 --> 34:39.240
Imagine living in a block and there were 3,000 noise complaints.

34:39.240 --> 34:42.240
One of those days had 100 noise complaints.

34:42.240 --> 34:46.240
What does this say about the ways in which we handle conflict in those areas?

34:46.280 --> 34:52.280
And so I was able to go from showing the trend, understanding sort of like whether

34:52.280 --> 34:56.280
figuring out a way of looking into that hypothesis of discrimination that might be

34:56.280 --> 35:00.280
happening in gentrifying neighborhoods, to finding a hot spot.

35:00.280 --> 35:05.280
And the main part that it comes down to as well to make you understand the story better,

35:05.280 --> 35:10.280
because I can tell you all the statistics around it, is we wanted to find a person.

35:10.280 --> 35:12.280
And we found this young man.

35:12.280 --> 35:13.280
He's 105 years old.

35:13.320 --> 35:14.320
He's 105 years old.

35:14.320 --> 35:17.320
He used to live on that very street.

35:17.320 --> 35:22.320
And he did tell us, and I think we interviewed about 40 people to get to that point.

35:22.320 --> 35:29.320
He did tell us that he, after 30, I think it was four decades of living in that block,

35:29.320 --> 35:35.320
once the noise complaints kept on going up, he had to stop living the way he used to live

35:35.320 --> 35:42.320
his life, playing dominoes outside and I guess having chit chat outside on the streets.

35:42.360 --> 35:47.360
So one of the things that we needed to do was to go from the larger findings of the

35:47.360 --> 35:52.360
data down to what that feels like on the ground to real human beings.

35:53.360 --> 35:58.360
And with that said, I think once we had explored that, we also wanted to find a better

35:58.360 --> 36:00.360
understanding of the why behind the data.

36:00.360 --> 36:06.360
And I think that is one of the main parts that sometimes is more difficult to get to.

36:06.360 --> 36:11.360
And that takes a lot more research with experts who have either worked with populations

36:11.400 --> 36:15.400
there, experts who live on that block, people who are experts in their lived experience,

36:15.400 --> 36:19.400
as well as experts who work on an academic level on that.

36:19.400 --> 36:24.400
And we were able to find the why behind that data by talking to several folks.

36:24.400 --> 36:29.400
So this is a quote from a person who studies gentrification.

36:29.400 --> 36:32.400
He mentioned that when you live in a neighborhood where you feel comfortable knocking

36:32.400 --> 36:34.400
on your neighbor's door, then you would do that.

36:34.400 --> 36:39.400
So what he means by that is that a lot of people felt very uncomfortable

36:39.440 --> 36:44.440
due to racial issues, due to being new and having longer established folks.

36:44.440 --> 36:49.440
Whatever the reason was, they didn't feel comfortable talking to their neighbors

36:49.440 --> 36:52.440
about the noise complaints, about the noise outside.

36:52.440 --> 36:55.440
And so instead mediated the conflict through a third party.

36:55.440 --> 36:56.440
Right.

36:56.440 --> 36:58.440
That was one of the whys.

36:58.440 --> 37:03.440
And then we also spoke to several people who did call the cops on that block on their

37:03.440 --> 37:04.440
neighbors.

37:04.480 --> 37:09.480
And one of them said there's this tendency among new residents of people of not

37:09.480 --> 37:11.480
addressing problems directly.

37:11.480 --> 37:16.480
He said he had called 311 a few times to deal with his downstairs neighbor who was

37:16.480 --> 37:17.480
playing loud rap music.

37:17.480 --> 37:21.480
He also said he didn't feel safe approaching his neighbor to ask for the music to be

37:21.480 --> 37:22.480
turned down.

37:22.480 --> 37:27.480
He said this used to be a bad neighborhood, even though this stands in stark contrast

37:27.480 --> 37:30.480
with crime rates in that neighborhood as well.

37:30.520 --> 37:35.520
And so I think one of the things that's hopefully clear through this story is that

37:35.520 --> 37:39.520
some of the things that you might be seeing, the hypothesis that you might be

37:39.520 --> 37:45.520
building around something can be really answered through very clear analyses, almost

37:45.520 --> 37:51.520
like a scientific way of using census data to tell those kinds of stories.

37:54.520 --> 37:55.520
Thank you, Lam.

37:55.520 --> 37:57.520
That was a wonderful presentation.

37:57.520 --> 37:58.520
Really appreciate it.

37:58.520 --> 37:59.520
Thank you again.

37:59.560 --> 38:04.560
And please, before we go to the next speaker, let me remind everyone if you have any

38:04.560 --> 38:09.560
questions, you can drop them in the chat and we'll try to get to them at the end of

38:09.560 --> 38:10.560
the presentations.

38:10.560 --> 38:18.560
So let's go to our third speaker, who is Shannon Arvizu, who is a sociologist and

38:18.560 --> 38:22.560
senior advisor in the Office of the Chief Data Officer at the Department of

38:22.560 --> 38:23.560
Commerce.

38:23.560 --> 38:28.560
She combines her expertise in organizational change management, social science

38:28.600 --> 38:33.600
and systems thinking to support evidence-based policymaking efforts.

38:33.600 --> 38:37.600
In her role within the Department of Commerce, she leads efforts to improve the

38:37.600 --> 38:42.600
use of data for federal programs aimed at increasing equitable outcomes and

38:42.600 --> 38:45.600
opportunities for communities across the country.

38:45.600 --> 38:49.600
She also leads two equitable data communities of practice, one for data

38:49.600 --> 38:54.600
practitioners within the DOC and one for practitioners within a larger federal

38:54.640 --> 38:59.640
landscape aimed at building capacity for more rigorous government program

38:59.640 --> 39:00.640
design.

39:00.640 --> 39:06.640
In addition, Dr. Arvizu is the founder of Epic Teams, a leading consultancy in the

39:06.640 --> 39:09.640
field of agile organizational performance.

39:09.640 --> 39:10.640
Shannon?

39:11.640 --> 39:12.640
All right.

39:12.640 --> 39:13.640
Thank you so much.

39:13.640 --> 39:19.640
And thank you, Lam, for that very inspiring example of data journalism in

39:19.640 --> 39:20.640
action.

39:20.680 --> 39:25.680
So, I want to share with you today the power of data storytelling to solve

39:25.680 --> 39:27.680
public problems better.

39:27.680 --> 39:32.680
And I hope that after this presentation, you are all inspired to be equitable

39:32.680 --> 39:34.680
data practitioners.

39:34.680 --> 39:40.680
And I want to first start with a personal story of how pandemic data led to my

39:40.680 --> 39:43.680
tour of duty in public service.

39:43.680 --> 39:48.680
So, with that, I will share my next slide.

39:48.720 --> 39:54.720
I'm a sociologist, and I've always been very passionate and interested about how

39:54.720 --> 39:56.720
social change occurs.

39:56.720 --> 40:01.720
How do our institutions evolve to better meet the needs of the common good?

40:01.720 --> 40:06.720
And we know that all social change happens through organizations.

40:06.720 --> 40:12.720
Organizations are the medium through which ideas and resources and data turn

40:12.720 --> 40:15.720
into products and services and policies.

40:15.760 --> 40:20.760
And I spent the last 10 years working inside mission-driven organizations to

40:20.760 --> 40:23.760
help them do that transformational work.

40:23.760 --> 40:28.760
And in particular, I helped them develop systems to do three things better.

40:28.760 --> 40:33.760
How to build the right things in the right way and at the right speed for the

40:33.760 --> 40:35.760
people that they serve.

40:35.760 --> 40:40.760
And I built a pretty successful practice, worked my way up to Fortune 500

40:40.800 --> 40:45.800
companies, helped them surpass their revenue goals and help some tech

40:45.800 --> 40:48.800
companies achieve billion-dollar exits.

40:48.800 --> 40:51.800
And then the pandemic hit.

40:51.800 --> 40:56.800
And all of a sudden, we were all inside during lockdown looking at

40:56.800 --> 40:58.800
dashboards every day.

40:58.800 --> 41:03.800
And I found it super fascinating as a sociologist to see that Americans

41:03.800 --> 41:08.800
across the country were governing their daily lives by data, looking at

41:08.840 --> 41:11.840
hospitalization rates and infection rates and death rates.

41:11.840 --> 41:16.840
And it really got me thinking, wow, okay, where is all the other data about

41:16.840 --> 41:19.840
where all other parts of our society are doing?

41:19.840 --> 41:24.840
And it was really interesting to also look at the intersection between COVID

41:24.840 --> 41:26.840
data and sociodemographic data.

41:26.840 --> 41:31.840
And we saw, for example, that there were pretty wide disparities when it

41:31.840 --> 41:33.840
came to health outcomes.

41:33.880 --> 41:38.880
We know that Black and Latino and Asian communities were disproportionately

41:38.880 --> 41:43.880
impacted, mostly because they were more likely to be living in homes where

41:43.880 --> 41:48.880
there was a higher density and were more likely to live in jobs that were

41:48.880 --> 41:50.880
not remote.

41:50.880 --> 41:55.880
We also know that there were wide disparities in economic impacts.

41:55.880 --> 41:59.880
Here's a line of folks in line for a food bank in Brooklyn.

41:59.920 --> 42:04.920
And we know that those that were in low-paying jobs, again, were

42:04.920 --> 42:07.920
disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.

42:07.920 --> 42:11.920
And low-paying jobs account for 30% of all American jobs.

42:11.920 --> 42:16.920
And we know that Black and Latino women in particular are more likely to be

42:16.920 --> 42:18.920
in those lower-paying jobs.

42:18.920 --> 42:23.920
And lower-paying jobs accounted for 56% of all jobs that were lost during

42:23.920 --> 42:25.920
that time.

42:25.960 --> 42:31.960
We also saw that there were disparities in terms of educational outcomes.

42:31.960 --> 42:35.960
We know that those in predominantly Black and Indigenous communities

42:35.960 --> 42:40.960
already experienced disparities when it came to access to books and high

42:40.960 --> 42:42.960
student-to-teacher ratio.

42:42.960 --> 42:47.960
And they were also less likely to have access to computers and the internet,

42:47.960 --> 42:52.960
which had a greater impact than just on their educational outcomes.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
It also affected a lot of other outcomes.

42:56.000 --> 43:00.000
I have this quote here from the Harvard Graduate School Education

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Dean Bridget Long.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
And she says, you think about schools and academics, but a child's school

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
is social and emotional support.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
It's safety.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
It's a food system.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
It's health care.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
It's all of those things that those students missed out on during that

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
time.

43:13.000 --> 43:18.000
And unfortunately, we also saw disparities when it came to access to

43:18.000 --> 43:22.000
basic necessities like clean, running water in your home.

43:22.040 --> 43:27.040
We know that those in Navajo country, for example, about 30% didn't have

43:27.040 --> 43:30.040
access to clean, running water in their homes.

43:30.040 --> 43:34.040
And that also proved to be a challenge in a time when frequent hand

43:34.040 --> 43:37.040
washing was a way to stay healthy.

43:37.040 --> 43:42.040
So all of those disparities existed before the pandemic.

43:42.040 --> 43:48.040
And this pandemic data really brought to light the differences that

43:48.080 --> 43:52.080
Americans experience based on where they live and where they come from.

43:52.080 --> 43:57.080
And those have real impacts for the type of life that you lead and also

43:57.080 --> 44:00.080
how long of a life that you lead.

44:00.080 --> 44:04.080
And so this became my passion during the pandemic.

44:04.080 --> 44:09.080
I became really interested in understanding how might our government

44:09.080 --> 44:13.080
institutions better deliver the right things in the right way and at the

44:13.080 --> 44:16.080
right speed for the communities who need it most.

44:16.120 --> 44:23.120
And when I say government, I want to introduce a definition of citizens

44:23.120 --> 44:26.120
working together to solve shared problems.

44:26.120 --> 44:31.120
And this to me really is the definition of being an American.

44:31.120 --> 44:38.120
And when I had the opportunity to be of service to our chief data officer

44:38.120 --> 44:42.120
team at the Department of Commerce, I jumped at it because I thought

44:42.160 --> 44:47.160
there's no better way for me to use my talents and skills to be able to

44:47.160 --> 44:50.160
help contribute to furthering of this mission.

44:50.160 --> 44:55.160
And what I've uncovered in my time so far is that there are millions of

44:55.160 --> 44:58.160
civil servants that are working to fulfill this core purpose of our

44:58.160 --> 45:03.160
government, which is to equip every American with a fair shot to build

45:03.160 --> 45:08.160
their best life possible for themselves and for their families.

45:08.200 --> 45:13.200
And our government has made some historic investments in the last couple

45:13.200 --> 45:18.200
years to address those disparities, including the American Rescue Plan,

45:18.200 --> 45:23.200
which provided things like stimulus checks and emergency rental assistance

45:23.200 --> 45:28.200
and support to schools in order to strengthen the safety net when it was

45:28.200 --> 45:29.200
most weak.

45:29.200 --> 45:34.200
We also know that there was a second historic investment called the

45:34.240 --> 45:39.240
Infrastructure Bill, which made investments in things like improved

45:39.240 --> 45:43.240
water quality for those in Navajo country, for example, and bringing

45:43.240 --> 45:46.240
broadband to rural communities so they can access education and

45:46.240 --> 45:48.240
employment opportunities.

45:48.240 --> 45:54.240
So with all of this, we ask ourselves, how do we know whether we are

45:54.240 --> 45:59.240
actually moving the needle to address those disparities?

45:59.240 --> 46:03.240
And there's a movement underway in the federal government, which I'll call

46:03.280 --> 46:08.280
the Equitable Data Movement, and this is a movement spearheaded by

46:08.280 --> 46:13.280
White House Chief Data Scientist Denise Ross and others that really

46:13.280 --> 46:18.280
builds on the work of the Evidence Act, which was passed in 2019 nearly

46:18.280 --> 46:23.280
unanimously by those in Congress, to build an evidence-based policy

46:23.280 --> 46:24.280
culture.

46:24.280 --> 46:29.280
And so to drill a little bit deeper into this notion of equitable data,

46:29.320 --> 46:34.320
we have this definition, which is data which enables rigorous

46:34.320 --> 46:37.320
assessment of the extent to which government programs and policies

46:37.320 --> 46:42.320
yield consistently fair, just, and impartial treatment of all

46:42.320 --> 46:43.320
individuals.

46:43.320 --> 46:49.320
And the reason why this is so important is because we need to focus

46:49.320 --> 46:54.320
on opportunities for targeted actions to result in improved outcomes

46:54.320 --> 46:57.320
for underserved communities.

46:57.360 --> 47:00.360
And I want to share with you an example.

47:00.360 --> 47:04.360
Since I'm using the term equity, oftentimes people are curious about

47:04.360 --> 47:07.360
what's the difference between equality and equity.

47:07.360 --> 47:10.360
And so if you take a rental assistance program, from an equality

47:10.360 --> 47:15.360
perspective, every county receives an equal amount of rental assistance

47:15.360 --> 47:19.360
funds, whereas from an equity perspective, counties with renter

47:19.360 --> 47:23.360
households that have higher rates of cost burden receive proportionally

47:23.360 --> 47:26.360
more funds than other counties.

47:26.400 --> 47:31.400
And so the focus really is on what are called underserved communities

47:31.400 --> 47:35.400
and how do we identify those underserved communities?

47:35.400 --> 47:39.400
Well, the first step is we need to disaggregate the data.

47:39.400 --> 47:41.400
So what does that mean?

47:41.400 --> 47:46.400
That means that we look at their data by demographic information.

47:46.400 --> 47:49.400
So we're looking at differences between income, race, gender,

47:49.400 --> 47:50.400
language spoken.

47:50.400 --> 47:55.400
We disaggregate it by geography and other relevant variables that

47:55.440 --> 47:58.440
are relevant variables for your program efforts.

47:58.440 --> 48:03.440
And I want to share an example of how equitable data practices

48:03.440 --> 48:05.440
look like in action.

48:05.440 --> 48:10.440
So I'm going to use the Digital Equity Act as an example.

48:10.440 --> 48:15.440
So as part of the infrastructure bill, about $2.75 billion is

48:15.440 --> 48:18.440
administered through our National Telecom and Information

48:18.440 --> 48:23.440
Administration to communities that could benefit from digital skills

48:23.480 --> 48:27.480
training, improved online accessibility, and really empowering

48:27.480 --> 48:30.480
rural communities in particular to be able to measure and address

48:30.480 --> 48:32.480
their own broadband needs.

48:32.480 --> 48:36.480
So you may ask yourself, OK, where are those communities?

48:36.480 --> 48:40.480
What type of population would benefit most from this?

48:40.480 --> 48:45.480
So we know from research that these are the types of communities

48:45.480 --> 48:48.480
that are less likely to have access to the Internet.

48:48.520 --> 48:53.520
Folks that are making less than 150% of the poverty line.

48:53.520 --> 48:57.520
Older folks, those who have been incarcerated, veterans, disabled,

48:57.520 --> 49:00.520
those that face a language barrier, racial or ethnic minorities,

49:00.520 --> 49:03.520
and those that tend to be in rural communities.

49:03.520 --> 49:06.520
So then you may ask yourself, but where are they located?

49:06.520 --> 49:13.520
So Census and NTIA collaborated to create the Digital Equity Act

49:13.520 --> 49:15.520
population viewer.

49:15.560 --> 49:19.560
And you can start to see here, at least on a state-by-state basis,

49:19.560 --> 49:23.560
where are the states that have the most amount per capita of those

49:23.560 --> 49:26.560
types of folks that are in those covered populations?

49:26.560 --> 49:30.560
And when you dive a little bit deeper into this, say, for example,

49:30.560 --> 49:34.560
in New Mexico, you can start to see the breakdown by that

49:34.560 --> 49:35.560
disaggregation.

49:35.560 --> 49:39.560
And you can also see here their usage as it comes to the Internet

49:39.560 --> 49:42.560
and PC, also from ACS.

49:42.600 --> 49:48.600
So ACS, I've been getting a tip or hats off in this session today.

49:48.600 --> 49:54.600
And so, again, this is an example of how equitable data practitioners

49:54.600 --> 49:58.600
start to better design programs so that way we are meeting the needs

49:58.600 --> 50:00.600
of those who need it most.

50:00.600 --> 50:05.600
And so I throw out this term, equitable data practitioner.

50:05.600 --> 50:08.600
And we are in the business of illuminating opportunities

50:08.600 --> 50:10.600
for targeted actions.

50:10.640 --> 50:15.640
And as an equitable data practitioner, we are civic data entrepreneurs.

50:15.640 --> 50:19.640
So we're inspiring new ways of thinking about data and analysis

50:19.640 --> 50:22.640
in program design and delivery.

50:22.640 --> 50:24.640
We are also change agents.

50:24.640 --> 50:29.640
So we might not always have access to all the data we'd like to have,

50:29.640 --> 50:31.640
but we look for the low-hanging fruit.

50:31.640 --> 50:32.640
We see what we can do now.

50:32.640 --> 50:34.640
We see coalitions of the willing.

50:34.640 --> 50:36.640
Who's excited to do this work?

50:36.640 --> 50:39.640
And then once we find really interesting, powerful ways to do

50:39.680 --> 50:41.680
this work, we seek to institutionalize them.

50:41.680 --> 50:45.680
So that way this just becomes how we do things.

50:45.680 --> 50:48.680
And lastly, we are continuous learners.

50:48.680 --> 50:52.680
So we're all learning together how to build the next-gen

50:52.680 --> 50:54.680
government data infrastructure.

50:54.680 --> 50:57.680
And it's really important that we look internally

50:57.680 --> 50:59.680
across the federal landscape.

50:59.680 --> 51:02.680
We look to state and local governments and nonprofits.

51:02.680 --> 51:04.680
We look for the people who are benefiting from programs

51:04.680 --> 51:08.680
and really engaging them in this continuous feedback loop.

51:08.720 --> 51:11.720
So that is my call to you all.

51:11.720 --> 51:15.720
Now that you have an idea of what equitable data practitioners do

51:15.720 --> 51:18.720
and the stories that we can tell when we do our work well,

51:18.720 --> 51:22.720
I invite you all to see yourselves as part of this movement.

51:22.720 --> 51:25.720
And if you'd like to continue the conversation,

51:25.720 --> 51:28.720
you can find me on LinkedIn.

51:28.720 --> 51:30.720
So thank you very much, everyone.

51:30.720 --> 51:33.720
And I pass the talking stick back to you.

51:34.720 --> 51:36.720
Thank you, Shannon.

51:36.720 --> 51:37.720
That was wonderful.

51:37.760 --> 51:39.760
I really appreciate this.

51:39.760 --> 51:44.760
So we're going to move to our last but not least speaker

51:44.760 --> 51:46.760
who is Philip Deng.

51:46.760 --> 51:49.760
He is co-founder and CEO of Grantable,

51:49.760 --> 51:53.760
a world-class grant writing assistant for everyone

51:53.760 --> 51:55.760
powered by AI.

51:55.760 --> 51:58.760
Philip has been working at the nonprofit sector

51:58.760 --> 52:00.760
for more than 15 years on three continents

52:00.760 --> 52:02.760
and in three languages.

52:02.760 --> 52:04.760
He loves to cook and gather with friends.

52:04.800 --> 52:07.800
He lives in Richmond, Virginia with his partner Anita

52:07.800 --> 52:09.800
and their two pups, Harper and Suki.

52:09.800 --> 52:11.800
I love the personal touch, Philip.

52:11.800 --> 52:13.800
Take it away.

52:13.800 --> 52:15.800
Thank you so much, Aya.

52:15.800 --> 52:18.800
And thank you, everybody, for having me at this summit.

52:18.800 --> 52:21.800
It really is an honor that I feel like I've skipped

52:21.800 --> 52:23.800
a few steps to arrive at.

52:23.800 --> 52:25.800
But I'm grateful to be here.

52:25.800 --> 52:28.800
And I don't have a presentation deck,

52:28.800 --> 52:31.800
so I'm just going to try to speak and kind of bring my thoughts

52:31.800 --> 52:33.800
together along with what the other presenters

52:33.840 --> 52:35.840
have shared today.

52:35.840 --> 52:38.840
Where I want to begin to set the stage is just to

52:38.840 --> 52:42.840
call back to the bio that was just read about me.

52:42.840 --> 52:47.840
I probably have the least amount of in-depth experience

52:47.840 --> 52:50.840
with data and numbers of anybody on this panel.

52:50.840 --> 52:54.840
My background is almost 15 years in the nonprofit sector

52:54.840 --> 52:58.840
as a practitioner on the ground in different countries

52:58.840 --> 53:00.840
working in different languages.

53:00.880 --> 53:04.880
And my focus from that has been in grants.

53:04.880 --> 53:08.880
And so I think I was asked to join today's panel to talk

53:08.880 --> 53:12.880
about how data can be effective in storytelling

53:12.880 --> 53:14.880
in a grants context.

53:14.880 --> 53:19.880
And I think what are consistent themes with what everybody

53:19.880 --> 53:24.880
else has shared today is that stories are very powerful.

53:24.880 --> 53:27.880
There are problems that need to be solved.

53:27.920 --> 53:29.920
And so we're asking ourselves today,

53:29.920 --> 53:33.920
how can we measure the world around us to help us tell

53:33.920 --> 53:35.920
these stories to solve problems?

53:35.920 --> 53:41.920
And so I think grants are very much a synthesis of that effort.

53:41.920 --> 53:45.920
For those of you that maybe don't know the statistics,

53:45.920 --> 53:49.920
about $800 billion worth of funding is distributed

53:49.920 --> 53:51.920
as grants every year.

53:51.920 --> 53:54.920
My company's estimated probably about 30 million

53:54.920 --> 53:56.920
grant proposals are written.

53:56.960 --> 54:00.960
By all kinds of different organizations, agencies,

54:00.960 --> 54:02.960
and even businesses as well.

54:02.960 --> 54:06.960
We saw that during COVID for sure and people applying

54:06.960 --> 54:08.960
for their different relief funds.

54:08.960 --> 54:12.960
So that's sort of the context that I've been working in.

54:12.960 --> 54:16.960
And one of the observations that I've made,

54:16.960 --> 54:20.960
particularly in my role now transitioning from the

54:20.960 --> 54:24.960
nonprofit sector into a tech startup role,

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
particularly one working with AI,

54:28.000 --> 54:33.000
is that I believe the nature of data is changing

54:33.000 --> 54:37.000
and so will storytelling with it.

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
As an example, probably many of you have heard of

54:40.000 --> 54:43.000
or played around with chat GPT.

54:43.000 --> 54:47.000
And for those of you who maybe haven't delved deeply into how

54:47.000 --> 54:51.000
that chat bot is generating these wild and sometimes

54:51.040 --> 54:55.040
very amazing skillful outputs,

54:55.040 --> 54:59.040
it has been trained on a massive amount of data,

54:59.040 --> 55:03.040
mostly text data from the internet and with enormous

55:03.040 --> 55:07.040
amounts of computing power and complex algorithms.

55:07.040 --> 55:13.040
It is teasing patterns out of that data and using probability

55:13.040 --> 55:15.040
to generate these text outputs.

55:15.040 --> 55:20.040
So I saw a parallel with today's theme and today's discussion

55:20.080 --> 55:24.080
and I thought one of the things I could do for those gathered

55:24.080 --> 55:28.080
here today is to kind of point out what I see happening

55:28.080 --> 55:32.080
at scale here, which again is data is changing and the way

55:32.080 --> 55:35.080
we can tell stories with it is as well.

55:35.080 --> 55:41.080
So chat GPT is data and from it we are now coaxing out

55:41.080 --> 55:45.080
patterns which are literally telling us stories.

55:45.080 --> 55:47.080
If you go to this chat bot and you say,

55:47.120 --> 55:50.120
hey, tell me a bedtime story, it will.

55:50.120 --> 55:55.120
And it is doing that literally from massive amounts of data

55:55.120 --> 55:59.120
which human engineers have trained to find patterns

55:59.120 --> 56:03.120
and bring out of the data and it is now writing bedtime

56:03.120 --> 56:05.120
stories if that is what you ask it to do.

56:05.120 --> 56:09.120
So I just think one of the things that is very interesting

56:09.120 --> 56:13.120
for I think the people gathered today is to stretch our

56:13.160 --> 56:17.160
imaginations a little bit and think about what might

56:17.160 --> 56:22.160
storytelling with numbers mean in the future, in the next few

56:22.160 --> 56:24.160
months, in the next few years?

56:24.160 --> 56:29.160
How are we going to take these themes of equity, these themes

56:29.160 --> 56:33.160
of measuring impact and figuring out how to make

56:33.160 --> 56:35.160
evidence-based decisions?

56:35.160 --> 56:40.160
What else can we do if we lay a lens of this new paradigm

56:40.200 --> 56:46.200
of tech-enabled data analysis to help us in that effort?

56:46.200 --> 56:49.200
So that was one thing I really wanted to call out today

56:49.200 --> 56:52.200
and ask people to think about and try.

56:52.200 --> 56:56.200
And in that effort I will just say a lot of people I have

56:56.200 --> 57:00.200
encouraged to do that, try it out and the first reaction

57:00.200 --> 57:05.200
is a pretty heady mix of excitement and anxiety.

57:05.200 --> 57:09.200
A lot of people are creeped out quite frankly by what these

57:09.240 --> 57:13.240
things are capable of doing and what I'm not doing is

57:13.240 --> 57:17.240
telling people to calm down or don't worry about it.

57:17.240 --> 57:21.240
I'm actually telling everyone to listen to that emotion,

57:21.240 --> 57:25.240
to that instinct that is saying, hey, this is different,

57:25.240 --> 57:29.240
this is strange, this is unsettling, and to allow that

57:29.240 --> 57:33.240
to heighten our senses and to say, okay, I'm now sitting up,

57:33.240 --> 57:37.240
I'm paying attention, what is this thing and how do we all

57:37.280 --> 57:40.280
collectively get our arms around it and use it?

57:40.280 --> 57:44.280
So that's just one thing I wanted to mention that I think

57:44.280 --> 57:49.280
is relevant in the moment as pertains to data.

57:49.280 --> 57:53.280
And then to bring it back to grants, for those of you who

57:53.280 --> 57:58.280
may be working on grants for different agencies or

57:58.280 --> 58:01.280
organizations, some things I wanted to call out from my own

58:01.280 --> 58:06.280
experience as a grant writer and recipient, I echo what

58:06.320 --> 58:09.320
Brent said at the beginning to sort of begin with your

58:09.320 --> 58:14.320
audience and to shape your narrative based on who are you

58:14.320 --> 58:18.320
trying to tell a story to, who are you trying to move with

58:18.320 --> 58:22.320
your narrative, and from there I think it usually becomes

58:22.320 --> 58:25.320
clear what kind of data to use.

58:25.320 --> 58:30.320
I also think based on your audience, you kind of have to

58:30.320 --> 58:35.320
pick the Zoom that you're going to put on the numbers or the

58:35.360 --> 58:38.360
quantitative material that you're using.

58:38.360 --> 58:43.360
So if your funder, for example, is working on national level

58:43.360 --> 58:47.360
initiatives, then you're probably going to want numbers

58:47.360 --> 58:50.360
that convey the scale of work that is going to have a

58:50.360 --> 58:55.360
national impact versus a local foundation.

58:55.360 --> 58:58.360
This is, again, just in my purview, you would want

58:58.360 --> 59:03.360
numbers that maybe actually highlight a clinic or a food

59:03.400 --> 59:07.400
bank in the neighborhood where the funder lives and have

59:07.400 --> 59:11.400
numbers that clarify that that's the level of focus that

59:11.400 --> 59:13.400
you're trying to achieve.

59:13.400 --> 59:18.400
So I think the scope is really important, as is choosing when

59:18.400 --> 59:21.400
to use numbers and when to use words.

59:21.400 --> 59:24.400
I think that's how I came into this conversation, but maybe

59:24.400 --> 59:29.400
after hearing several of my co-panelists, I think it's kind

59:29.400 --> 59:32.400
of how do you use both together in a really compelling way.

59:32.440 --> 59:37.440
So I think the examples I came in with are when there's a

59:37.440 --> 59:42.440
story of individual impact, you probably don't want to boil

59:42.440 --> 59:45.440
that down to a single number or a few statistics.

59:45.440 --> 59:48.440
But if you wanted to show change, if you wanted to show

59:48.440 --> 59:53.440
how a program is growing and how prior grant funding has

59:53.440 --> 59:57.440
impacted the ability to scale the benefits and impact, then

59:57.440 --> 01:00:00.440
I think numbers are really powerful.

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:05.480
One of the last things I wanted to bring attention to is

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:10.480
unfortunately I would say when is measuring something or

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:12.480
measuring it in the wrong way?

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.480
When can data be harmful?

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:18.480
I don't think I heard that brought up, and I think it's a

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:23.480
very real outcome that unfortunately organizations can

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:25.480
find themselves in at times.

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:31.520
So what I've seen personally is organizations that are asked

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:37.520
to measure outcomes and program activities in a way that is

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:42.520
so detailed and burdensome that they either can't do it or

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:45.520
they're actually coming up with numbers that really, they

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.520
can't really stand behind.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:51.520
In the worst cases, maybe made up, and in the best cases,

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.520
they're kind of fuzzy.

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:56.560
So I think that can be a real problem and I think something

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:59.560
that the field is starting to address.

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:05.560
I think also, I saw a comment earlier, if things get done

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:09.560
when we focus on them or whatever we measure tends to

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:10.560
get done.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:15.560
I think that is usually meant as a positive, but in another

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:20.560
sense, sometimes if we measure something, everybody really

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:25.600
starts to try to make that metric rise or that metric fall,

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:29.600
whatever that metric starts to become this overwhelming force,

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:34.600
this guiding star, and I just think it's always important for

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:38.600
everybody to take a step back and look at what we're doing

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:42.600
because sometimes the pursuit of a single metric or a single

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:46.600
number can really be misleading for certain groups.

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:50.640
If you're just pursuing, say, profit, for example, I think

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.640
we're all looking at that and what the effects are on our

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:54.640
society.

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:57.640
That's obviously a very well-measured number in our

01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:01.640
culture, but it doesn't quite capture all of the

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:06.640
externalities that sometimes pursuing just profits can

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.640
create for the society.

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:11.640
So I think that's an example that without singling anyone

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:14.640
out, I wanted to just throw that out there.

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:17.680
It can cause people to bend the truth.

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:20.680
It can cause people to draw the wrong conclusions.

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:24.680
So I think what I always advocate when I speak with

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:30.680
grantors and grantees that I coach, what can we do in terms

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:33.680
of data integrity and continuity?

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:37.680
So what I mean by that is what can we measure confidently,

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:41.680
accurately, and within our capacity and for the long term

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:43.680
so that we can see trends?

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:47.720
I think I see a lot of people sprint to try to win a grant

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:51.720
and they will devote lots of resources to game a number.

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:55.720
If we want lots of volunteers, if we have to show that we

01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:58.720
have great participation numbers, then the entire

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:02.720
organization starts to shift all of its resources to

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:07.720
hosting events that are just big rather than effective.

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:10.720
So I think that's probably an example that a lot of folks

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:11.720
can relate to.

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:15.760
So hopefully some of that stuff brings at least some

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:19.760
questions to mind and I think I'm happy here to stand

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:23.760
alongside my more data expert co-panelists and if there's

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:28.760
anything about grant seeking and maybe particularly what's

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:30.760
happening with AI and technology.

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:32.760
I'm looking forward to some questions as well.

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:34.760
So hopefully I'm on time.

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:36.760
You are, Phil.

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:39.760
That was wonderful and we're not creeped out.

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.800
So thank you.

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:44.800
Thank you for talking about something that I think

01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:50.800
everyone is wondering about and testing and I know many

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:54.800
folks in the media industry are wondering if they'll have

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:57.800
jobs in the next couple months as a result of this.

01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:01.800
So I'm going to start the question period.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:04.800
I'll start off with one question that was in the chat

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:07.800
from Kimi and it's for Philip.

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:11.840
Kimi says, I wonder if only the stories and data that are

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:15.840
being searched for will be identified by data gathering

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:16.840
and analysis.

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:19.840
What about the stories that are not identified?

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:22.840
Could you elaborate a little more?

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:26.840
I think there's a very, very interesting question that

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:27.840
I'd love to.

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:28.840
Okay.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:31.840
So it's like a poll, right?

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:36.840
When poll takers go out, they have an assigned set of

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:40.880
questions and they're asking those questions, right?

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:42.880
And they get responses to them, right?

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:48.880
But sometimes the story, the items that are most

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:51.880
interesting to that community or most challenging to that

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:54.880
community don't correspond to the questions that are asked,

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:55.880
right?

01:04:55.880 --> 01:05:01.880
So this is the same, you know, this could be similar, right?

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:05.880
So the people who are saying, you know, how do we evaluate

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:08.920
this data, right?

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:14.920
You know, maybe that data relates to a phenomenon that

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:19.920
hasn't emerged as being quantifiable or important yet.

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:24.920
Like the previous speaker, one of the previous speakers, she

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:29.920
said that an old man, 105-year-old man, he can't, like,

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.920
he can't live the same way he used to live.

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:34.920
He can't just be out in the community playing checkers and

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:35.960
what have you.

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:40.960
Like, the quality of his life has basically eroded because

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.960
of gentrification, right?

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.960
But this is not an expected outcome.

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:50.960
It's not something that someone who's not a community member

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:53.960
would think probably to look for.

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:57.960
So are we going to capture that data or not capture that data?

01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:58.960
Okay.

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:00.960
Thank you for clarifying that.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:08.000
I think my first reaction there is that what I believe is

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:13.000
increasingly possible is that we can take, let's take your

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
example of survey data and all those data points that are

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000
coming in.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:22.000
What I believe is increasingly possible is to apply more and

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:27.000
more computing power to data sets and what that power is

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:32.040
doing is looking for very, very complex patterns to emerge.

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:39.040
So I think what the frontier is and the work for us is I think

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:44.040
we're going to see connections that are both very, very

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:49.040
insightful, to use sort of what Brent brought up at first, and

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:54.040
I think we're going to see one of those connections that are

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:59.080
really challenging and reveal aspects of our society that are

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:02.080
extremely uncomfortable, maybe extremely controversial that

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:07.080
people are going to really have a lot of intense debate over.

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:12.080
So I think that maybe what you're saying, what are the other

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:15.080
things that are just beyond the questions that we're literally

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:20.080
asking people, I think more of that is going to be illuminated

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:25.120
by the basic computational advancements that companies are

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:30.120
making, and I think the role for all of us will be to prepare

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:35.120
for sort of, if you imagine literally light kind of filling

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:40.120
more of a darkness, we have to prepare as people to take on

01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:45.120
what we see and what is revealed.

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:48.160
Thank you.

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.160
We appreciate that.

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:51.160
Thank you, Phillip.

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:56.160
I'm trying to keep track of some of the questions or statements.

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:59.160
It's mostly statements in the chat.

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:03.160
If anybody has a question, you can just speak up and ask any of

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:06.160
the panelists.

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:11.160
If nobody is speaking up, I see one question in the chat.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:16.200
What do you do when officials want to apply one indicator

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:21.200
specific methodology to all related data requests because it

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:23.200
is easiest?

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:28.200
That sounds like a workplace issue, but I don't know if

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:31.200
Shannon or anyone else wants to address that.

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:34.200
I just wanted to clarify the conversation.

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:37.200
I feel like, hi, my name is Leah Icon.

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:39.200
I work at the Administration for Children's Services at New

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:42.240
York City, and I handle the child stat data analytics.

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:49.240
One thing that I find in terms of kind of, I created a unit

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:53.240
that kind of wanted to expand the data conversation to the

01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:56.240
frontline staff as well as all the databases and the data

01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:59.240
literacy behind all of these performance indicators and

01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:00.240
metrics.

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:06.240
Sometimes it's hard to get people to really stop and use

01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:07.280
the data.

01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:10.280
Sometimes they be their minds a little bit to say, hey, these

01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:13.280
are the questions asked of an indicator, and this is what the

01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:14.280
answers are.

01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:18.280
But over here for a city council report or something else,

01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:21.280
there's a different question asked, but the words sound the

01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:22.280
same.

01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:28.280
And so I'm wondering because I really, really appreciated

01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:33.280
Shannon's presentation today and speaking pretty much the same

01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:37.320
kind of explain to my team of people how and why we do this is

01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:40.320
to get out there, get the conversation from the community,

01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:45.320
bring it back, and then kind of apply also the metric standards

01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:49.320
to say, here's the basic ways we need to build a metric or an

01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:52.320
indicator, but here's the questions that can be asked of it.

01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:55.320
Here's the data behind it and full transparency.

01:09:55.320 --> 01:10:00.320
But then there's another issue with, and I feel like it's not

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:01.320
just government.

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:03.360
It's a little bit bigger than this.

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:07.360
People not able to stop and think for just a second, like we

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:11.360
can ask different questions of indicators and let us quickly

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:14.360
storytell you the differences, right?

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:19.360
Like we try to bring in these like little stories or anecdotes

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:22.360
so that people will start to learn the difference between a

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:25.360
performance indicator asked of a frontline staff to speak to

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:29.360
versus what we might report at a citywide level.

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:33.400
And so I'm wondering if you have any guidance around how to stop

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:37.400
and slow people down that aren't really, that are too busy for

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:41.400
everything else, but you also need them to take notice that

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:43.400
these things are different.

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:49.400
Yeah, I'll share that I feel your pain.

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:53.400
I had a conversation today that had a very similar tone.

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:57.400
And the one thing that we know is that oftentimes these

01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:02.440
indicators are a simplification of reality and that it really

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:04.440
needs to be contextualized.

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:10.440
And we're talking in the context of jobs, 50 jobs in an urban

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:16.440
region is not the same as 50 jobs in a tribal reservation.

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:23.440
And so context matters to situate these stats.

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:28.480
And so just balancing the case studies with the indicators and

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:33.480
coupling them together, we found to be helpful moving forward.

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:36.480
But I'll pass the talking stick back.

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:41.480
And I see what you're struggling with for sure.

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:45.480
I hope that answered your question.

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:49.480
I see a question in the chat for Lam.

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:54.520
Where would you go to build a story about how federal dollars

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:58.520
are spent by agency for a specific geographic area like

01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:00.520
Puerto Rico?

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:01.520
Oh, okay.

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:03.520
Puerto Rico is probably different.

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:06.520
There are databases that look into contracts.

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:09.520
I think there's a lot of relationships between government

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:13.520
agencies and private contractors and what that expenditure looks

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:14.520
like.

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:18.520
If you ping me afterwards, I can find you the exact source that

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.560
we used for something similar.

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:24.560
I do not know whether that specific database I have in mind

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:27.560
also looks to Puerto Rico, but I can look into that.

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.560
And because I'm also part of the investigative reporters and

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:33.560
editors network, I can ask a few folks who are working there to

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:34.560
stay in touch.

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:37.560
And then the other thing that you might want to think about is

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:40.560
the way in which I teach data is oftentimes the data sets that

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:44.560
are being given out to the public are not always everything

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:45.560
that an agency has.

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:50.600
And so this might be a longer term kind of project or a longer

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:55.600
term endeavor, but a lot of the times thinking about the forms

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:59.600
that people fill out or the databases that governments use

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:03.600
and then figuring out a way of filing Freedom of Information Act

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:06.600
requests or public records requests might be a way for you

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:10.600
to play around with finding data sets around the subject you

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:11.600
care about.

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:17.640
And the last but not least, as a practitioner of data collection

01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:23.640
and I'm a coder, I do a lot of Python scraping, there are also

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:27.640
ways to investigate these types of subjects with data sets that

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:31.640
are adjacent to that, whether it's through public databases

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:35.640
that like private databases like Property Shark or something

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:39.640
like that, for example, or databases that you kind of build

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:40.640
yourself.

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:44.680
I call them DIY data sets, do it yourself data sets by cobbling

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:47.680
together information that lives on the Internet and then putting

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:49.680
that into a spreadsheet and then analyzing it for that.

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:52.680
That might be an interesting way for you to look into that.

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:54.680
That's great, Lam.

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:57.680
It looks like we've come to the end of our session.

01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:02.680
So anybody who has questions, I think you can reach out

01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:05.680
directly to all of our panelists.

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:09.680
Their contact information is in the chat and I believe that this

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:11.720
will be made available to everyone.

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:13.720
So again, thank you.

01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:17.720
Round of applause to everyone who spoke today was fascinating.

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:18.720
Thank you again.

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:20.720
Thank you.

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:23.720
And before we wrap up real quick, I just want to mention a

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:24.720
quick comment.

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:28.720
I heard something I was kind of I stepped away for a second

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:30.720
around contracts in Puerto Rico and data.

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.720
I'm going to drop two links in the chat that you might be

01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:33.720
interested in.

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:36.720
This organization that is doing great work and working with

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:40.760
Open Contracting Partnership, which is an offshoot of the

01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:41.760
World Bank.

01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:43.760
And you heard from one of those speakers earlier in Top Summit.

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:45.760
So check those two links out.

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:48.760
It's contracts in law and it's great being more than 58

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:52.760
government websites in Puerto Rico and then basically mapping

01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:58.760
out every contract, every RFP, NOFO and procurement transaction

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:02.760
to open corporates data and business register data in

01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:03.760
Puerto Rico.

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:04.760
So check that out.

01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:05.760
It's on the chat.

01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:06.800
Thank you so much for tuning in.

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:08.800
Thank you, guys.

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:09.800
Thank you.

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:10.800
Bye, everyone.

01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:13.800
Thank you for moderating, show speakers, Brent, Lam, Phillip

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:14.800
and Shannon.

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:15.800
It was a pleasure to have you guys.

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:16.800
I learned so much.

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.800
Thank you all for participating in Top Summit 2023.

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:19.800
Thank you.
