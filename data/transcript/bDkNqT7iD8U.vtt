WEBVTT

00:00.467 --> 00:14.696
All right, the board will continue its meeting and therefore we will, I want to need to announce that the board in closed session discussed and or took action on LAT versus state at all.

00:15.997 --> 00:20.560
So we're now ready for our first item this morning, which is item 21 on the

00:22.702 --> 00:26.965
Alpine Unified School District, CDE, will make the first presentation.

00:27.645 --> 00:31.227
This is a public hearing, so each side will then have 10 minutes.

00:32.527 --> 00:41.032
Then we'll have a board discussion on technical issues only, and then we'll have public comment, and then the board will deliberate on the issue.

01:13.283 --> 01:13.963
I can make a few.

01:14.243 --> 01:15.884
Yeah, could you make a few remarks?

01:15.964 --> 01:28.709
Yes, we don't need the PowerPoints.

01:31.510 --> 01:32.110
OK, better?

01:32.450 --> 01:32.831
Yes.

01:32.891 --> 01:33.171
OK.

01:35.171 --> 01:36.492
Kind of at an awkward angle here.

01:36.612 --> 01:38.813
I'm Larry Shirey, School Fiscal Services Division.

01:39.874 --> 01:44.178
This morning we're going to start you off with the unification proposal from San Diego County.

01:45.879 --> 02:02.994
Voters in the Alpine Unified Elementary School District there have signed a petition to form a new unified school district from the territory of the Alpine Elementary School District and the corresponding portion of the Grossmont Union High School District.

02:04.392 --> 02:07.234
Alpine Elementary District supports the proposal.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.836
The Grossmont High School District opposes it.

02:10.956 --> 02:20.202
The county committee, San Diego County Committee, which is also the county board in San Diego, is recommending that the state board approve it.

02:21.103 --> 02:24.185
We are taking the position that we're recommending disapproval.

02:24.725 --> 02:28.628
And hopefully that will become clear as we go through the presentation.

02:40.649 --> 02:41.069
Are we up?

02:41.269 --> 03:00.559
Yeah, we're up.

03:01.019 --> 03:02.500
OK, I'm just looking here.

03:02.560 --> 03:03.100
OK, I'm sorry.

03:06.318 --> 03:11.321
First of all, before we start on discussing the proposal, let's talk about what we're going to be doing here today.

03:13.162 --> 03:14.622
And I need to go back.

03:15.443 --> 03:17.264
How do I go back here?

03:28.009 --> 03:29.470
I think there are some slides missing.

03:40.236 --> 03:43.277
We had some edits to the slide, and I don't think we have the most recent version here.

03:43.337 --> 03:47.038
But the first slide is going to talk about the role of the State Board today.

03:48.018 --> 03:49.298
The role of the State Board today?

03:49.318 --> 03:49.878
Yeah, go ahead.

03:49.918 --> 03:50.698
You can tell us that.

03:50.758 --> 03:51.259
Yeah.

03:52.959 --> 03:55.660
The first thing you're going to be doing is listening to our presentation.

03:56.440 --> 03:59.080
These four things I'm going to talk about are required by statute.

03:59.581 --> 04:03.441
You're required to consider the position of the Department of Education.

04:04.122 --> 04:09.883
You're then required to hold a public hearing and consider public testimony on the issue.

04:10.751 --> 04:20.821
We are then going to talk about and you need to consider the nine minimum threshold standards that are required in the reorganization.

04:23.664 --> 04:29.470
Those are, you can see that?

04:31.833 --> 04:32.073
Okay.

04:47.756 --> 04:48.136
There we go.

04:49.997 --> 04:50.337
OK.

04:53.298 --> 04:56.739
So we're down to number three, the third bulleted item.

04:59.980 --> 05:06.282
You need to look at the nine minimum threshold standards that are listed in the education code.

05:06.302 --> 05:13.824
You're going to be looking at if the reorganized districts are of adequate size, if they're based on substantial community identity,

05:15.049 --> 05:35.807
if the assets and liabilities of Grossmont High School District are equitably divided, if education will continue in an integrated environment, whether or not the proposal will increase costs to the state, if there will be any effects on the educational programs of the districts,

05:36.738 --> 05:52.264
if the proposal will increase school facility cost, if we need to make sure that the intent of the proposal was not to increase anyone's property values, and the final condition is the fiscal effects on the school district's other proposal.

05:54.264 --> 05:55.865
Your options today are three.

05:56.965 --> 05:59.066
You can disapprove the unification proposal.

06:00.307 --> 06:04.709
You can determine the proposal has merit and return it to the local level for further action.

06:05.170 --> 06:06.410
You cannot approve it today.

06:06.891 --> 06:08.251
These are projects under CEQA.

06:09.072 --> 06:12.794
And before you can approve a project, it has to go through the CEQA process.

06:12.814 --> 06:14.315
And that would be done at the local level.

06:15.035 --> 06:19.097
Or you can simply delay action if you feel you need additional information.

06:19.657 --> 06:22.479
We're recommending, as I indicated earlier, disapproval.

06:25.154 --> 06:28.617
Here is a map of the Grossmont Union High School District.

06:30.339 --> 06:43.910
I have to apologize, I'm getting over this flu or plague or whatever it is that's afflicting people and if I pause to pull throat lozenges out or grab my water bottle, I'll apologize in advance.

06:49.115 --> 06:51.157
This map shows the boundaries

06:52.074 --> 06:56.457
of the eight component elementary school districts within Grossmont Union High School District.

06:58.538 --> 07:07.004
And the numbers with circles around them indicate the general locations of the 11 comprehensive high schools in the district.

07:07.725 --> 07:15.970
The district has, the high school district has about 22,000 ninth through 12th grade students in these facilities.

07:16.210 --> 07:20.133
The high school district itself is located in the southern portion of San Diego County

07:20.774 --> 07:23.195
immediately to the east of the city of San Diego.

07:23.295 --> 07:26.816
In fact, portions of that city are within the boundaries of Grossmont.

07:27.816 --> 07:32.597
The Alpine District is the easternmost component district in Grossmont.

07:34.098 --> 07:38.559
It's the second smallest in terms of ADA at about 1,750 students.

07:39.299 --> 07:44.141
The eight districts range in size from about 850 at Humboldt del Zura to almost 17,000 in Cajon Valley.

07:49.571 --> 07:54.455
Just over 800 high school students from the Alpine area attend Grossmont schools.

07:55.717 --> 08:08.168
Since Alpine is within the attendance boundaries of the Granite Hills High School, which is number three on your map, most of the students attend that school, about 520 of them.

08:08.768 --> 08:14.954
Another 230 or so attend number nine, which is Steel Canyon Charter School.

08:16.061 --> 08:19.745
And that's about 92% of the students attend these two schools.

08:20.145 --> 08:28.554
The remainder are scattered throughout about five of the other nine high schools in the district.

08:29.835 --> 08:37.823
The high school district has a policy that students can basically attend any high school they want as long as there's an opening in the high school.

08:39.790 --> 08:42.656
Granite Hills High School is just off of Interstate 8.

08:42.716 --> 08:45.101
I don't know if you can see that gray line that's running.

08:45.482 --> 08:50.051
And Interstate 8 also runs through the center of the Alpine community.

08:51.222 --> 08:59.089
It's about 12.5 miles from the middle school, which is about in the center of the Alpine community.

08:59.990 --> 09:13.341
This distance from the high school of the community is one of the reasons that the Alpine community has been pushing for a high school in this area and also unification so that they could build a high school.

09:16.864 --> 09:25.211
As I indicated, there's been decades-long interest in unification or building a high school in Alpine.

09:25.531 --> 09:33.118
In fact, in 2003, there was a joint resolution from Alpine and Grossmont to approve unification.

09:33.538 --> 09:39.484
That went to the county committee, the county board, but the county board recommended disapproval.

09:40.441 --> 09:57.587
to the state board because they didn't think the new Alpine district would not be able to offer a sufficient educational program, that there would be increased cost for building a new high school, and the new Alpine district could not fund those costs.

09:58.247 --> 10:03.009
And finally, they thought there would be a negative fiscal effect on a new Alpine district.

10:03.669 --> 10:08.271
So that was a recommendation in 2003 that came to the board, but before the board could hear it,

10:08.991 --> 10:22.380
The districts determined to work together to support putting a bond on the ballot, a couple of bonds actually, to build a high school.

10:22.640 --> 10:26.723
One of the purposes of the bonds was to build a high school in the Alpine area.

10:27.863 --> 10:34.108
The boards then requested that the state board disapprove the unification, which it did at its November 2004 meeting.

10:36.209 --> 10:37.450
The bonds that were approved.

10:38.229 --> 10:47.592
as I indicated, included funding for an Alpine area high school, one in 2004, one in 2008, but the bond language also contained a trigger.

10:48.192 --> 10:56.455
The high school enrollment had to meet the 2007-2008 enrollment levels in Grossmont at the time construction bids were put out.

10:57.395 --> 11:05.517
The Grossmont High School District acquired a site for the high school within the boundaries of Alpine and completed some pre-construction activities between 2009 and 2012.

11:09.185 --> 11:15.267
However, in 2009 when they acquired the site is the peak of these enrollment projections.

11:15.307 --> 11:24.391
Two years prior, 2007-8 is the trigger, enrollment at Grossmont as well as many high school districts started to plummet.

11:27.012 --> 11:34.715
As a result, in 2012, Grossmont placed a hold on construction of the Alpine High School due to this declining enrollment.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.776
Alpine community became very concerned that

11:38.513 --> 11:44.177
Continued bond expenditures of Grossmont would drain funding for an Alpine area high school.

11:44.217 --> 11:56.306
It's a large high school district, has a number of other issues it needs to address and it continued to issue and fund these maintenance and modernization efforts.

11:57.467 --> 12:03.351
There was a grand jury report 2012-13 that reflected the Alpine community's concerns.

12:03.931 --> 12:06.293
The grand jury report recommended that

12:06.971 --> 12:22.083
Grossmont should either commit to building the high school with a timeline and put the funds aside for the construction, or it should support any Alpine unification effort that came forward.

12:29.170 --> 12:41.101
But in 2014, Alpine Community submitted another unification proposal, again, concerned that they were not going to get the high school built by the Grossmont High School District.

12:41.401 --> 12:42.622
Again, this went to the county.

12:43.283 --> 12:52.731
County feasibility study, the County Office of Education contracted with School Services of California to do a study on the feasibility of the Alpine Unified School District.

12:53.632 --> 12:55.113
That study determined that

12:56.724 --> 13:07.992
It would significantly increase school housing costs, and also that the new Alpine district would not have the resources sufficient to address those costs.

13:08.953 --> 13:13.156
Despite the finding, the county committee voted to recommend approval of the proposal.

13:18.760 --> 13:23.884
But again, throughout this process, Grossmont High School District was continuing to issue bonds.

13:24.760 --> 13:27.803
and fund its maintenance and modernization needs.

13:28.724 --> 13:38.592
And the concern in Alpine kept growing that these funds were going to be depleted before it could get to constructing a high school.

13:38.672 --> 13:49.422
And they were also concerned that some of the projects that Grossmont was funding were of a lower priority as listed in the bond measures than construction of the high school.

13:50.563 --> 14:02.112
So they went to the trial court and asked for an injunction, preliminary injunction, requesting that the high school district set aside sufficient funding.

14:02.132 --> 14:07.616
I think they were asking for $70 million at that time, sufficient funding to construct the high school.

14:07.636 --> 14:11.860
The trial court granted the injunction and ordered Grossmont to set aside $42 million.

14:13.277 --> 14:14.098
Grossmont appealed.

14:14.598 --> 14:20.222
The court of appeal then determined that the preliminary injunction was valid and returned it to the trial court.

14:21.063 --> 14:34.072
The trial court subsequently ordered a trial on the issue of whether Grossmont High School District was obligated to build an Alpine area high school.

14:35.453 --> 14:41.538
The court ruled that Grossmont was not obligated to build the high school because the enrollment trigger had not been met.

14:42.463 --> 14:47.408
And the district had discretion to put the construction on hold due to other economic circumstances.

14:48.969 --> 14:51.111
They were still feeling the effects of the recession.

14:51.672 --> 14:56.196
So assessed value in the district had fallen as well as district funding.

14:57.117 --> 14:58.378
Alpine appealed the ruling.

14:58.879 --> 15:02.502
Now, this last bullet has changed somewhat.

15:03.343 --> 15:06.566
As of yesterday, the Court of Appeal issued its opinion.

15:07.521 --> 15:18.918
and supporting or affirming the action of the trial court stating that Grossmont or confirming that Grossmont High School District is not obligated to build the high school under current circumstances.

15:20.154 --> 15:37.881
This opinion doesn't have any effect on our recommendations because all of our analysis and recommendations were without regard to conditions in the litigation, so those remain unchanged.

15:39.707 --> 15:43.010
What was the court's reasoning on this?

15:43.030 --> 15:46.473
I haven't looked at that, but if you don't want to discuss it now.

15:46.493 --> 15:47.473
Excuse me, I didn't hear you.

15:48.294 --> 15:50.416
We can come back to that if you don't.

15:50.856 --> 15:56.160
I haven't really looked at the opinion that closely, so I'd have to bring our legal counsel up to discuss that.

15:59.963 --> 16:06.649
So let's move away from the historical context of this reorganization proposal and talk about what we're going to be doing today.

16:08.187 --> 16:11.150
I'm going to go through those nine minimum threshold conditions.

16:11.750 --> 16:24.401
I'm going to take them in order of starting with the least controversial and least complex, working through until we get to the final one, which is the rationale that we're using for recommending this approval.

16:25.728 --> 16:35.033
We recommend that five of the conditions in Ed Code section 35753 are substantially met with no significant concerns.

16:36.033 --> 16:38.235
One is that the districts will be of adequate size.

16:38.815 --> 16:44.218
Two, that they'll all be based on substantial community identity.

16:44.558 --> 16:48.580
That the reorganization will preserve education in an integrated environment.

16:49.602 --> 16:56.626
and that there will be no significant cost to the state as a result of the reorganization, and it's not designed to increase property values.

16:57.427 --> 17:07.133
Now, at the local level, the Grossmont High School District did express some concerns about whether or not education would be in an integrated environment.

17:07.533 --> 17:10.455
They made the argument that Alpine could not

17:10.953 --> 17:15.055
provide as diverse an environment as Grossmont does.

17:15.115 --> 17:16.455
Well, that's true to some extent.

17:16.975 --> 17:23.478
Alpine has about 36% minority students, I believe, while Grossmont is around 57%.

17:24.378 --> 17:29.280
The reorganization itself will have minimal effects.

17:31.061 --> 17:33.362
If there's a high school built, whether it's by Grossmont

17:34.022 --> 17:44.527
or by Alpine, if it's a unified school district in the area, the demographics of the high school will reflect the Alpine community, regardless of who builds the high school.

17:45.927 --> 17:54.291
In addition, the high schools in Alpine already reflect a fairly wide range of diversity.

17:54.691 --> 17:58.573
They range from high schools that are 40% minority to those that are over 90% minority.

18:00.302 --> 18:06.546
There will be no effects on, of course, the middle school or elementary students because no populations will change there.

18:07.707 --> 18:17.654
If we look at what the reorganization proposal would do, if you pulled all of the Alpine students out of Grossmont, it would increase the minority percentages by one percentage point.

18:18.394 --> 18:27.200
If you looked at the two high schools, Granite Hills and Steel Canyon, it would increase minority student percentages in each of those districts by about three percentage points.

18:27.620 --> 18:30.122
We see that as not substantial.

18:34.246 --> 18:38.528
Now we have a couple of conditions that have a little more concern with them.

18:39.609 --> 18:45.052
One is whether or not the proposal will promote sound education performance.

18:46.133 --> 18:51.816
The Alpine High School would have limited extracurricular and academic opportunities.

18:51.836 --> 18:56.859
It's going to be much smaller than any of the high schools that Grossmont operates.

18:58.192 --> 19:07.037
Right now, Granite Hills High School, which is the primary high school Alpine students attend, offers an international baccalaureate diploma program.

19:07.717 --> 19:12.099
The students from Alpine are well represented in the courses of that program.

19:12.520 --> 19:20.564
Similarly, the Alpine students are well represented in the AP classes of both Granite Hills and Steel Canyon.

19:21.325 --> 19:30.088
There has not been any concerns raised in the Alpine community about the quality of education that students receive in these high schools.

19:30.448 --> 19:32.529
The high schools perform well academically.

19:33.209 --> 19:43.612
And again, there are no concerns that educational programs for Alpine kids are deficient in any way.

19:44.572 --> 19:49.074
So we have some concerns regarding whether it can compete.

19:50.259 --> 19:57.187
with Grossmont Union High School District for students, especially since there are a couple of district authorized charter schools in the district.

19:58.969 --> 20:00.971
But we still find the conditions substantially met.

20:01.872 --> 20:05.776
The other has to do with the negative fiscal effect of the reorganization.

20:06.617 --> 20:09.180
Alpine Elementary is currently deficit spending.

20:09.460 --> 20:10.521
This reorganization will not change that.

20:13.220 --> 20:20.665
But as in any case where an elementary district is bringing in a high school program, it's going to increase costs somewhat.

20:21.966 --> 20:24.988
The biggest increase would be due to teacher salaries.

20:25.829 --> 20:33.615
Right now, the teacher salaries in Alpine are considerably lower than the Grossmont High School district teacher salaries.

20:34.475 --> 20:36.817
If in these days of teacher shortages,

20:37.634 --> 20:48.940
Alpine Unified would be competing with Grossmont for high school teachers, so there would need to be at least some raising of the salary schedule to have that competition.

20:52.922 --> 21:02.067
However, we think that there would be enough time for a new Alpine Unified School District to organize

21:02.990 --> 21:11.832
and that it would be able to, if it made prudent budget decisions, there wouldn't be a negative fiscal effect.

21:12.272 --> 21:17.953
Of course, if those prudent decisions are not made, there may be some concern for fiscal insolvency here.

21:18.613 --> 21:20.693
But again, we find the conditions substantially met.

21:22.854 --> 21:25.094
Now we're gonna get a little more complex.

21:27.975 --> 21:28.935
Whenever a,

21:31.351 --> 21:35.994
A district is divided as Grossmont would be in this reorganization proposal.

21:36.014 --> 21:38.956
A portion of the territory would go to an Alpine Unified.

21:39.577 --> 21:46.862
There has to be a proposal to divide the property funds and obligations of the high school district.

21:48.563 --> 21:54.427
And we find this condition substantially met, but we're bringing it up here because there has been

21:55.525 --> 22:08.571
a good degree of not consistency, but a certain disagreement at the local level about what constitutes an equitable division of property and obligations.

22:09.471 --> 22:10.492
So let's look at statute.

22:12.012 --> 22:24.598
Section 35560, in part, states that the real property, which is the land and facilities and fixtures that are associated with the facilities, shall be the property of the district in which the real property is located.

22:25.575 --> 22:30.497
All other properties, funds and obligations, except bonded indebtedness, will be divided pro rata.

22:31.098 --> 22:35.560
The default standard for division, this pro rata division, is the SUS valuation.

22:36.060 --> 22:39.421
This is kind of a relic from the pre-Prop 13 days.

22:40.222 --> 22:47.425
But what we typically recommend and what the board typically approves is that you look at the source of funding.

22:48.474 --> 22:51.196
and make appropriate divisions based on that.

22:51.296 --> 23:04.203
So in general, any capital-based project funds would be divided based, pro rata, based on AV, assessed valuation, and all other funds basically would be divided pro rata based on either ADA or enrollment.

23:08.705 --> 23:11.187
However, the Alpine proponents argue that

23:12.702 --> 23:26.537
any equitable division of Grossmont's assets must include consideration of, boy, did that get an echo all of a sudden?

23:26.857 --> 23:34.105
That equitable division of Grossmont assets must include consideration of real property or the monetary value of real property.

23:35.219 --> 23:41.885
The result then is that the Grossmont High School District should provide Alpine with about $70 million after unification.

23:42.725 --> 24:00.660
They justify this by stating that Alpine has made a promise or that Grossmont has made a promise to build a high school in the Alpine community and that any plan for division of assets should include funding for the new unified school district to build that high school.

24:01.581 --> 24:03.643
Again, as we noted earlier,

24:04.381 --> 24:10.991
The current court opinion is that the Grossmont High School District does not have the obligation to build the high school currently.

24:13.315 --> 24:20.085
As we talked earlier, section 35560 clearly prohibits division of real property.

24:21.465 --> 24:22.086
And it's C.D.'

24:22.046 --> 24:29.912
's opinion that you can't skirt this prohibition by reducing real property to a monetary value.

24:30.553 --> 24:38.639
So we do not see that the proponent's proposal is based in any legal or equitable standards.

24:42.442 --> 24:45.765
The Alpine unification proponents further argue that

24:46.565 --> 25:02.994
The authorized but unissued bonds of the Grossmont High School District can and should be used for the majority of the $70 million that they believe is owed to an Alpine Unified School District should the unification proposal be approved.

25:04.134 --> 25:10.818
We note that there is no provision in the Education Code to allow division of the authorized but unissued bonds

25:11.437 --> 25:12.498
under these circumstances.

25:12.558 --> 25:25.387
There is a provision that if the Grossmont High School District would go out of existence entirely, then its remaining bond authorization would be transferred to affected districts.

25:25.447 --> 25:29.650
But that is not an authority of the State Board.

25:29.670 --> 25:31.692
That's an authority of the County Board of Supervisors.

25:36.007 --> 25:43.030
So we recommend that the equitable division of assets threshold is substantially met under education code conditions.

25:44.950 --> 25:54.974
We do have some, I don't want to say concern, but we have a lack of understanding of what the county committee recommended.

25:55.014 --> 25:59.856
They recommended that the condition is met only under the plan put forward by the proponent.

25:59.916 --> 26:02.217
So they made a recommendation that

26:03.632 --> 26:12.359
The condition is substantially met only if basically Grossmont assets are used to construct a high school in a new Alpine district.

26:13.240 --> 26:21.967
We're not sure what the recommendation of the county committee would be if it had to fall under our interpretation of the education code.

26:25.230 --> 26:28.413
So now we're at the last threshold condition.

26:28.553 --> 26:31.976
We're talking about whether it will increase school facility costs.

26:33.390 --> 26:40.314
And there have been universal concerns throughout the history of Alpine's unification's effort.

26:40.374 --> 26:47.758
The 2003 study that the county office contracted for stated that concern in the county study.

26:47.778 --> 26:57.923
They found the conditions substantially met, but the concern they listed was that the new Alpine district would not be able to have the resources to fund construction of a new high school.

26:58.646 --> 27:05.747
The county committee recommendation, as I mentioned at the beginning, recommended disapproval based on that finding also.

27:05.827 --> 27:17.950
They found that it would significantly increase school housing costs, and a new Alpine district would not have the funding available to fund construction.

27:18.650 --> 27:21.490
That's also the finding of the current school services of California study.

27:24.997 --> 27:37.702
They find that the proposal would significantly increase school housing costs and that the new Alpine Unified District would not have the resources available to fund construction of the high school.

27:38.582 --> 27:43.284
The county committee conditionally approved this condition.

27:43.993 --> 27:56.257
And they found it substantially met, but only if the new unified school district basically did not build a high school, that they use existing facilities to provide the secondary program.

27:56.717 --> 28:04.000
So they also made at least some acknowledgment of the difficulty of funding a high school in the Alpine School District.

28:04.700 --> 28:07.241
Proponents themselves are concerned.

28:07.830 --> 28:20.559
They stated that this unification effort is an exercise in futility if the new district does not receive appropriate funding from the Grossmont High School District to construct a new high school.

28:22.421 --> 28:27.885
So with that context, we're recommending that that condition is not substantially met.

28:28.525 --> 28:30.807
There will be new cost of at least $45 million.

28:31.167 --> 28:33.409
Again, there's no local sources of funding identified.

28:34.116 --> 28:37.037
The new district would not have sufficient bonding capacity.

28:37.677 --> 28:43.258
They have expended all of their approved bond funds.

28:44.339 --> 28:49.140
And the Alpine voters have not supported a bond measure in 20 years.

28:51.501 --> 28:56.002
There, of course, would be the potential for state bond funds available.

28:56.042 --> 28:57.062
We have the 2016 approved bond fund.

29:01.556 --> 29:06.340
about $3 million set aside for new school construction.

29:06.900 --> 29:09.122
But those funds are rapidly being gone through.

29:09.623 --> 29:11.884
It's unsure that there would be anything available.

29:12.725 --> 29:25.916
And even if a new bond was issued before Alpine started construction, it's unsure whether the Office of Public School Construction would determine that the Alpine Unified District would have eligibility for state bond funds.

29:26.396 --> 29:29.819
Regardless, typically, the district would need to have a local match.

29:30.748 --> 29:43.361
for those funds, and as we stated earlier, those local matches usually come from approved bond measures, and there has been a difficult time approving such bond measures in this district.

29:45.905 --> 29:53.607
So as you know, even if you find one of the conditions not substantially met, you can still approve this or move it forward anyway at this time.

29:54.348 --> 30:08.812
If you determine that the condition cannot be, the conditions is not met, cannot be literally applied to the reorganization proposal and that there is an exceptional circumstance or a compelling reason to approve it.

30:09.732 --> 30:12.053
There are a number of compelling reasons out there.

30:12.748 --> 30:20.090
One is the longstanding interest and support for a high school and the reunification in the Alpine community.

30:20.731 --> 30:28.033
There have been historically joint efforts by both Alpine and Grossmont to build a high school in this area.

30:29.339 --> 30:36.142
As you saw in the map, the Alpine area is about 12 and a half miles from the nearest Grossmont High School.

30:36.282 --> 30:43.545
Certainly, there are some distance and safety issues regarding transportation to the school that can be considered.

30:44.285 --> 30:48.467
And also, you can look at some county-wide support for unification.

30:48.607 --> 30:58.071
The county committee is recommending you approve it, and the county grand jury also has some support for the Alpine community on this measure.

31:00.399 --> 31:10.226
Again, on the other hand, even if you find all the conditions substantially met, you don't have to recommend approval or move it forward.

31:10.787 --> 31:14.309
You can deny it or disapprove it based on other concerns you have.

31:15.250 --> 31:19.533
One of the concerns we haven't discussed yet are the enrollment declines in Alpine.

31:20.075 --> 31:32.278
It's been, enrollment there has been declining for about 15 years, even though the most recent enrollment projections or data show that there was a slight increase and projections are that will continue to increase.

31:33.338 --> 31:43.360
But that's kind of, it's not, those enrollment projections are not necessarily in line with the San Diego Association of Government projections.

31:44.501 --> 31:59.554
Even though those projections do eventually, by 2035, show high school students rising, increasing, until about 2020, they look at declines in the high school student population.

32:01.055 --> 32:10.523
Overall, Sandag has projected by 2035, population in the Alpine area will grow by about 24%.

32:12.222 --> 32:15.369
but those increases are not.

32:17.972 --> 32:19.833
the same across all age levels.

32:20.514 --> 32:31.382
The student population by age five through age 18 is projected to grow by 15%, while the age 65 and older population is projected to increase by 110%.

32:31.422 --> 32:44.391
And those types of changes in the enrollment and general population could affect the size, scale, and financial support for a high school.

32:45.532 --> 32:46.953
We've already talked about the

32:47.554 --> 32:54.526
the effects on educational program, facilities, and fiscal.

32:54.726 --> 32:56.930
So I'm not going to go into any more detail on that.

32:58.629 --> 32:59.850
We do have some other concerns.

32:59.990 --> 33:01.430
Well, now just one other concern.

33:02.391 --> 33:09.494
There is some inconsistency or lack of clarification and supporting data for some of the county committee's recommendations.

33:10.175 --> 33:22.861
As I indicated, they recommended that the increase in facilities costs condition is met only if the new Alpine district does not build a new high school.

33:23.361 --> 33:24.262
But on the other hand,

33:25.286 --> 33:34.516
their conditional recommendation that the equitable division of property condition is met only if Grossmont provides funding for the new high school.

33:34.857 --> 33:37.499
So that's kind of confusing to us.

33:37.620 --> 33:42.585
You certainly have the authority to direct the county committee.

33:43.277 --> 33:46.039
to come back with new plans and recommendations.

33:46.740 --> 33:47.720
We don't recommend this.

33:47.780 --> 33:51.003
I'm just pointing that out because you do have that authority.

33:51.703 --> 33:57.168
We don't see that any clarification from the county committee would affect our findings, our recommendations.

33:58.248 --> 34:02.932
And the issue about the pending litigation is no longer current.

34:04.491 --> 34:09.832
So last slide, your options restated here.

34:10.232 --> 34:13.973
You can disapprove the unification proposal.

34:14.633 --> 34:19.074
You can determine it has merit and return it for local action, which is primarily CEQA.

34:19.714 --> 34:25.195
Or you can delay action today until you have more information if you think additional information is required.

34:26.776 --> 34:32.917
Based on four general conditions, we are recommending disapproval.

34:33.689 --> 34:37.530
We don't find the facilities condition substantially met.

34:38.250 --> 34:39.071
It will increase.

34:39.191 --> 34:42.512
The unification proposal will significantly increase school housing costs.

34:43.372 --> 34:49.114
And there is no evidence that there would be resources in the Alpine community to fund those costs.

34:55.636 --> 34:58.617
Number two, under our interpretation of the education code,

34:59.384 --> 35:09.083
There is no legal or equitable rationale to support using Grossmont assets to fund construction of that high school.

35:11.325 --> 35:16.349
The current court position is that Grossmont does not have that obligation.

35:16.930 --> 35:24.416
And finally, in our opinion, there exists no compelling reason sufficient to overcome the shortcomings of the proposal.

35:25.297 --> 35:28.419
So now you will turn to a public hearing.

35:28.900 --> 35:34.044
I'm here to answer technical questions right now if you would like, or certainly I'll be here after public testimony.

35:34.324 --> 35:34.544
Yes.

35:34.684 --> 35:38.327
Could we hear what the court said yesterday?

35:38.347 --> 35:40.628
It is relevant to our deliberations.

35:40.908 --> 35:45.431
And so if you can't do that, is there somebody here who can do that?

35:45.752 --> 35:45.952
Yes.

35:46.192 --> 35:47.893
Here's Peter Stubbs in our legal office.

35:53.977 --> 35:56.899
Good morning, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen.

35:57.920 --> 35:59.981
I have read the Court of Appeals opinion.

36:01.622 --> 36:03.964
And in summary, they made

36:05.219 --> 36:06.279
Well, three findings.

36:06.339 --> 36:25.787
Number one, they held that under the unambiguous language of Proposition U, which was the ballot measure that authorized these bonds, an enrollment trigger was required to be met at the time of request for construction bids.

36:27.208 --> 36:29.269
That enrollment trigger, I think, was 23,245 district wide.

36:29.329 --> 36:29.969
And the court found that

36:35.970 --> 36:38.213
That enrollment trigger had not been met.

36:40.637 --> 36:52.553
While it was true that Grossmont had done some preliminary site work, the court found that that did not amount to construction, at least under the terms of Proposition U.

36:55.047 --> 37:11.432
They also found that although Grossmont had appointed a leaseback contractor, which as you probably know is one method of paying for the construction of a school, that did not involve any construction bids.

37:12.092 --> 37:13.753
So that didn't count either.

37:15.940 --> 37:44.590
The court also found that although Grossmont did not have an unfettered discretion whether to build a high school, nonetheless Grossmont did have some discretion, provided it was reasonably exercised, to prioritize other construction projects, because Prop U had not just the high school construction, but other projects listed on it.

37:46.656 --> 38:13.751
And the court found that Grossmont reasonably exercised that discretion in deciding to postpone construction of a high school because of financial circumstances, declining enrollment and budget cuts after the 2008 recession, and applying those funds to other projects which were prioritized.

38:16.305 --> 38:31.329
Finally, the court found that there was an action for what is called waste, which was bought by Alpine taxpayers for bond accountability or some such organization.

38:31.349 --> 38:43.613
The court, in essence, found that it was not waste for Grossmont to devote those bonds to other projects, even though

38:45.188 --> 38:58.116
That might result in all of the bond funds being exhausted because Grossmont was never obligated to build a high school because the enrollment trigger was not met.

38:59.517 --> 39:08.243
And furthermore, that trigger may never be met, but at any rate,

39:10.410 --> 39:22.957
Grossmont was not obligated, in essence, to set aside any portion of those funds to pay for the construction of a high school, at least until such time as that enrollment trigger was met.

39:25.058 --> 39:33.003
So in essence, the Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court's judgment on every single issue, actually, that was decided by the trial court.

39:36.158 --> 39:38.240
Okay, thank you for that.

39:38.521 --> 39:41.784
You may stay up because we may have questions on that.

39:42.325 --> 39:48.432
So we can, I guess, move now to the public hearing.

39:49.332 --> 39:52.193
and then the board can discuss.

39:52.273 --> 39:56.634
And so I guess you should sit down and I'll convene a public hearing.

39:56.674 --> 39:58.335
We may have questions for you later.

39:59.895 --> 40:09.138
So I would like to start with 10 minutes for the groups that support the proposed formation of a new Alpine Unified School District.

40:12.948 --> 40:16.751
One point that my colleague has drawn to my attention.

40:16.812 --> 40:22.556
That is that this decision was filed on the 18th, but it is not yet final.

40:22.576 --> 40:34.266
Just so that you're aware, this decision will become final at least as to the Court of Appeal 30 days after it was filed in the Court of Appeal.

40:35.787 --> 40:37.629
During that 30-day period, the appellants

40:38.780 --> 40:43.204
do have the right to petition the Court of Appeal for rehearing, they have 15 days to do that.

40:44.064 --> 40:47.147
That does not affect the finality after 30 days.

40:48.648 --> 40:58.176
Once that 30 days has expired, the appellants then have 10 days in which to petition the California Supreme Court for review, if that is their decision.

41:00.020 --> 41:09.586
And then the California Supreme Court effectively has a further 90 days after that in which to rule on the petition.

41:10.967 --> 41:22.094
So if you add up the 90 plus the 10 plus the 30, you have 130 days from January the 18th for the Supreme Court to rule on a petition for review should one be filed.

41:22.995 --> 41:26.657
And I don't know what the appellants of course at this point intend to do.

41:28.069 --> 41:28.609
Thank you for that.

41:28.830 --> 41:29.190
OK.

41:29.410 --> 41:29.690
All right.

41:29.770 --> 41:34.654
So now we're ready for the proponents to make their 10 minute presentation.

41:41.220 --> 41:43.021
Good morning, board members, community.

41:43.682 --> 41:48.385
My name is Dr. Rich Newman, and I'm the proud superintendent of the Alpine Union School District.

41:49.106 --> 41:55.531
The people of Alpine have shown unwavering support for a locally controlled K-12 district for almost 20 years.

41:56.852 --> 42:03.718
The Alpine Unification story is not simply about matching what is happening in our local traditional and charter high schools.

42:04.119 --> 42:20.354
It is about providing a local high school that is built with the community's involvement, where our students will not need to travel an hour or more each way to and from school by bus, where Alpine residents will be given a choice to attend their high school, and where we will also match the elements of a traditional high school.

42:21.363 --> 42:30.087
The CDE provided in its report that it believes a new Alpine high school would not be fully operational until 2025 at the earliest.

42:30.767 --> 42:35.149
The report also noted Alpine does not have the facilities to house a high school.

42:35.969 --> 42:38.971
When I read this report, I realized nobody

42:40.011 --> 42:42.333
who worked on it has visited Joe McQueen Middle School.

42:42.713 --> 42:52.541
Our middle school campus has permanent classroom capacity for over 1,000 students, which is 200 students more than the high school that was proposed by Grossmont.

42:53.362 --> 42:59.347
It has a full-size gym designed with a full stage that doubles as a multi-purpose performing arts center.

42:59.828 --> 43:02.630
We have nine acres of existing sports fields.

43:03.050 --> 43:08.175
We have a 10,000 square foot library that has the potential to be utilized for additional labs,

43:08.755 --> 43:09.896
to meet a high school curriculum.

43:10.356 --> 43:16.558
Our district has a capacity of up to 3,500 students, and we have the facilities to implement a high school.

43:17.339 --> 43:20.140
We can house a phased-in high school tomorrow.

43:21.120 --> 43:22.981
Let me also tell you about our programs.

43:23.602 --> 43:28.304
We have a dual-immersion language school, and this program would also matriculate into our high school.

43:28.884 --> 43:34.246
We offer robotics as part of our core curriculum, and as a result, we've had great success.

43:34.726 --> 43:37.748
Our team were the national champions in solar car racing last year.

43:38.368 --> 43:48.092
We currently have electives such as Culinary Arts, Performing Arts, Music, Coding, Spanish, Makerspace and Computer Science that would expand into our high school.

43:48.652 --> 43:52.533
We have an athletic program that competes against other schools in the county.

43:53.094 --> 43:58.736
As you can see, there are many rich programs that were not taken into account in the staff recommendation.

44:00.014 --> 44:05.719
We will not begin a school with 800 students, which is stated as a reason that unification would harm Grossmont.

44:06.460 --> 44:11.444
We plan to slowly build our program, beginning with the ninth grade, and expand each year thereafter.

44:12.325 --> 44:21.453
This board created precedent in the Bonzell Union School District, which is a school district in our local area and which houses its high school at its middle school.

44:22.014 --> 44:24.496
Their high school began with approximately 60 students.

44:25.837 --> 44:30.440
Again, our current facilities can be reorganized now to begin a high school.

44:31.420 --> 44:37.764
All of our speakers will share with you why Alpine is an exceptional case and the tremendous community support we have.

44:38.324 --> 44:44.288
We are simply asking for our students to have the opportunity to stay in their local community for high school.

44:45.825 --> 44:50.348
For me, being here today are the moments that remind us that all things are possible.

44:51.288 --> 44:54.570
I was brought to Alpine in part to help implement a high school.

44:55.251 --> 45:03.796
I was the former director of learning support services and the director of innovation for the Poway Unified School District, a 35,000 student K-12 district.

45:04.497 --> 45:09.239
I helped develop and build what is considered one of the most innovative schools in the county and state.

45:09.900 --> 45:14.383
I know what it takes to open an innovative school that engages the local community.

45:15.487 --> 45:27.677
I submit that Alpine is a place with not only tremendous hope, 20 plus years of hoping for a school, but the possibilities of creating an innovative high school program in Alpine are real and achievable.

45:28.397 --> 45:33.081
We stand ready to bring unification to Alpine and to make the dreams and hopes of our students a reality.

45:33.781 --> 45:35.763
I ask that you give us that opportunity.

45:36.343 --> 45:41.808
I invite you to visit our community and reconsider the recommendation you have before you today.

45:47.664 --> 45:47.984
Thank you.

45:48.684 --> 45:52.207
I'm Sal Casimacema, and I chair Alpine's High School Citizens Committee.

45:53.088 --> 45:56.231
First, let me address the decision that came down yesterday from the court.

45:57.332 --> 46:03.057
It just basically said, as was presented, that they did not have a legal obligation to build the Alpine High School.

46:03.637 --> 46:08.962
However, that decision just reinforces the primary reason we decided to pursue unification.

46:09.482 --> 46:13.746
Grossmont will never build a high school, and unification is our only option.

46:14.946 --> 46:29.590
Let me now deal with the CDE report, which rejected the unanimous decision and recommendation of the San Diego County Committee in support of Alpine, and instead relied heavily on the 2014 feasibility study, mentioned by Larry Shirey, submitted to the county.

46:30.291 --> 46:39.193
CDE determined, as he said, that eight of the nine criteria were met, but that the real stumbling block is criteria three regarding the division of assets and liabilities.

46:40.334 --> 46:41.854
CDE interprets the code

46:42.352 --> 46:48.254
to require Alpine to assume 100% of Grossmont's liabilities, but not the same share of its assets.

46:48.915 --> 46:49.755
This makes no sense.

46:50.375 --> 46:55.677
It's akin to a divorce in which one spouse gets to keep the house, while the other spouse has to pay the mortgage.

46:57.258 --> 47:06.222
CDE stated Alpine could only take the vacant Lazy A school site, but is not entitled to a share of any of the value of other Grossmont real property assets.

47:07.882 --> 47:09.183
The Grossmont bond program

47:10.171 --> 47:18.238
has generated about $850 million, which was used to upgrade Grossmont High Schools and greatly enhance their value.

47:19.238 --> 47:23.021
We're not asking that these schools be partitioned or sold off.

47:23.802 --> 47:35.912
We're simply asking they be included in asset valuation so that Alpine receives a fair and proportionate share of their value, enabling Alpine to finally do what Grossmont will not, build its high school.

47:37.113 --> 47:43.976
The Ed Code gives the State Board wide discretion to determine equitable sharing of assets and liabilities.

47:44.356 --> 47:55.441
The feasibility study said exactly that and told the County Committee it had discretion to recommend an equitable split of assets and liabilities, yet CDE never mentioned this.

47:56.422 --> 48:01.384
And it also fails to disclose that the study relied on State Board precedent.

48:02.305 --> 48:22.328
The 2012 Bonzell Unification, which is very similar to what Alpine is doing and has occurred in San Diego County, moved forward because you, the State Board, adopted a resolution saying, quote, all assets and liabilities of the Fallbrook Union High School District shall be divided proportionately.

48:23.473 --> 48:33.701
The feasibility study quoted this resolution and said regarding Alpine, the SBE may call for division of all assets similar to the action taken in Bonzel.

48:35.362 --> 48:42.367
Certainly, your resolution complied with the Ed Code back then and was fair and equitable to Bonzel and Fulbrich.

48:42.768 --> 48:45.690
The common sense of that resolution equally applies to Alpine.

48:47.150 --> 48:56.714
Clearly, with the very unfair and inequitable division of assets in the CDE report, there would not be enough money to build a brand new high school on the Lazy A site.

48:57.395 --> 49:01.957
However, there would be sufficient funds to convert our existing middle school into a high school.

49:02.837 --> 49:11.440
As described by Dr. Newman, who just stated, our middle school is fully capable of accomplishing all of our high school age, accommodating all of our high school age students.

49:12.260 --> 49:25.585
We therefore ask the state board to approve Alpine's unification and send it back to the county committee for determination of a fair and equitable division of all assets and liabilities consistent with this board's decision in Bonzell.

49:26.145 --> 49:31.027
With that approach, Alpine's unification, 20 years in the making, can finally be achieved.

49:31.167 --> 49:31.407
Thank you.

49:33.851 --> 49:34.252
Good morning.

49:35.273 --> 49:36.314
My name is Travis Lyon.

49:36.875 --> 49:41.021
I'm an Alpine school board member and the elected chairman of the Alpine Community Planning Group.

49:41.561 --> 49:45.286
I have a unique perspective on what this unification means to our community.

49:46.027 --> 49:49.712
You, the members of the state board, have a tremendous responsibility today.

49:50.513 --> 49:52.836
Our community's future rests in your hands.

49:53.698 --> 49:56.361
The CDE demographic report missed the mark.

49:57.022 --> 50:04.192
Alpine is already a community of 18,000 residents with over 1,000 high school aged children living within our district.

50:04.832 --> 50:08.037
But more than that, we're a community on a trajectory for growth.

50:08.800 --> 50:13.702
Sandag actually projected that our community will double its housing units over the next 20 years.

50:14.362 --> 50:18.263
We have one of the largest communities in the state that does not have a high school.

50:19.203 --> 50:26.966
Compounding that problem is the fact that we are geographically isolated from our neighboring communities and specifically our closest high schools.

50:27.626 --> 50:29.927
This forces a high school worth of kids

50:30.953 --> 50:37.895
to make a dangerous commute or travel on buses for over an hour each way every school day.

50:38.876 --> 50:41.317
Today, you'll hear from over 25 members of our community.

50:42.157 --> 50:46.478
What moves me most is that so many of these speakers no longer have a stake in the game.

50:46.999 --> 50:47.739
Let me explain that.

50:48.559 --> 50:49.600
My motivation is simple.

50:50.160 --> 50:54.123
I have three young children that will be educated in Alpine over the next 12 years.

50:54.904 --> 50:57.786
I am intimately invested in the success of the district.

50:58.466 --> 51:02.029
But so many of the speakers' children have promoted past eighth grade.

51:02.790 --> 51:07.353
They're not here because their children will receive a direct benefit from a long-promised high school.

51:08.074 --> 51:09.314
They're here because it's right.

51:10.075 --> 51:13.518
They've made sacrifices that I will be eternally grateful for.

51:14.707 --> 51:26.831
The fact that so many of these people have traveled over 500 miles to speak to you today should tell you something about our resolve and the ability of our community to do this and that how important this unification is to our kids.

51:27.671 --> 51:29.191
We have the facilities now.

51:30.132 --> 51:32.552
Our unification reasons are overwhelming.

51:33.233 --> 51:36.894
Please follow the recommendation of the county committee and approve unification.

51:37.714 --> 51:39.815
Give our community the choice it deserves.

51:40.575 --> 51:40.855
Thank you.

51:46.815 --> 51:55.068
Okay, now that you've used your time, I take it, and now we're ready for the opposing side to come up.

51:55.108 --> 51:56.089
You will have 10 minutes.

52:01.215 --> 52:08.116
Dr. Kirst, fellow board members and staff, I am Dr. Tim Glover, and I'm the proud superintendent of the Grossmont Union High School District.

52:08.796 --> 52:16.378
And with me today, I have board president Rob Shield and deputy superintendent Scott Patterson, and they've been involved in this discussion for well over a decade now.

52:17.198 --> 52:21.238
We're thankful for this opportunity to speak to you and share our concerns during this public hearing.

52:21.678 --> 52:23.619
And our presentation is going to have three parts.

52:24.279 --> 52:30.040
First, we're going to recognize and validate the thorough and impartial analysis completed by your CDE staff.

52:30.874 --> 52:36.437
Next, we're going to provide how we oppose the unification and share some additional insights to the points of the petitioners.

52:37.017 --> 52:45.562
And then finally, we're going to close by reinforcing our wholehearted support for CDE's recommendation and ask that you adopt CDE's recommendation.

52:47.303 --> 52:55.387
Again, CDE's analysis was thorough and impartial, and it validates that it was a sophisticated review by multiple members of the CDE staff.

52:56.108 --> 53:00.030
We recognize that it's a respectful analysis and that it aligns with education code.

53:01.141 --> 53:04.506
We also want to restate that there's some significant highlights in CDE's report.

53:05.146 --> 53:08.130
CDE is right to be concerned with the county committee's recommendation.

53:08.731 --> 53:15.560
It's politically charged, it is inconsistent, it lacked clarification, and it is without supporting data.

53:16.741 --> 53:17.902
Next, we agree with C.D.'

53:17.802 --> 53:28.087
's concerns that the fiscal study of the County Committee, that actual fiscal study concluded that there is not or does not meet regarding the equitable distribution of assets.

53:28.787 --> 53:30.067
And then finally, you heard C.D.

53:30.107 --> 53:38.852
mention specifically about the nine criteria and we agree with him that the errors in those nine criteria are not minor, they are significant in this discussion.

53:40.112 --> 53:50.716
Additional concerns that we agree with CDE on is that you should be concerned about the cost of a CEQA study if you were to refer it back and that there's no clear clarity around the funding of that CEQA study.

53:51.376 --> 53:55.778
We also agree that you should be greatly concerned about the enrollment declines.

53:55.798 --> 54:00.780
28% over the last 15 years in Alpine with 13% decline in enrollment in the last five years.

54:01.420 --> 54:07.422
And also the fact that our Grossmont Union High School District has 2,700 spaces for high school students in it now.

54:08.982 --> 54:09.262
C.D.'

54:09.222 --> 54:16.566
's analysis also indicates very accurately that the division of property suggested by the petitioners is prohibited by education code.

54:17.527 --> 54:18.007
And C.D.

54:18.087 --> 54:27.833
also notes in its study that if they were to unify, they could very well have qualified status on their financial reporting during their first couple of years at risk of economic failure.

54:28.693 --> 54:29.193
And C.D.

54:29.273 --> 54:33.356
also notes very clearly that any alternative division of assets that you may come with

54:34.216 --> 55:00.374
Warrant the idea of expanding the vote for unification not within the Alpine district, but the Grossmont district as a whole Now I'll turn it over to Scott Patterson for our reasons for opposing unification Good morning, Scott Patterson deputy superintendent of business services for the district I've held that position for almost a dozen years and it seems like for that entire time I've been observing and studying this issue.

55:00.495 --> 55:01.055
So why is

55:01.738 --> 55:04.760
does the Grossmont District oppose the unification proposal?

55:06.221 --> 55:13.927
Well first it will result in harm to the Grossmont students and we believe to some degree the Alpine students who are currently Grossmont students.

55:15.008 --> 55:21.893
We're in declining enrollment and we're talking about a potential 800 student decrease to the Grossmont enrollment.

55:22.353 --> 55:23.474
That won't happen across

55:24.127 --> 55:31.476
The system, that will happen at two of our high schools, representing about a 20% cut to those high schools.

55:31.957 --> 55:35.301
As those resources go away, the programs deteriorate.

55:35.442 --> 55:41.790
We're facing teacher layoffs and other cuts, including co-curricular and extracurricular.

55:42.813 --> 55:51.895
The oddity about this is per the feasibility study that was commissioned by the county committee, the LCFF rate for Alpine per pupil actually goes down.

55:51.995 --> 55:55.095
So they visit harm in terms of the per pupil rate.

55:56.356 --> 56:02.177
It's unreasonable to believe that Alpine would get the resources necessary to build a high school.

56:02.777 --> 56:09.158
First, as you've heard, there's no interpretation of the Ed Code that gets them the resources anywhere near what would be necessary.

56:09.892 --> 56:14.957
Then turning to the prospect of passing a bond, there's no reasonable expectation that they would pass a bond.

56:15.397 --> 56:18.620
You heard in the report that they haven't done so in over 20 years.

56:19.120 --> 56:27.588
And in fact, their last attempt to pass a bond in Alpine resulted in a 55% no vote, about the opposite of what you need to pass a bond measure.

56:30.253 --> 56:36.458
On the operational cost side, it's unreasonable to expect that they would be able to operate a high school program.

56:37.860 --> 56:40.142
We talked about the LCFF rate going down.

56:40.902 --> 56:46.467
And the big disparity between teacher salaries of the current Grossmont District and the Alpine District, it's nearly $16,000.

56:47.308 --> 56:56.396
So when you talk about having to either level up or create a uniform salary schedule, that's a tremendous cost burden unlikely that they would be able to bear.

56:57.836 --> 57:06.138
And when you think about the fact that Grossmont's robust educational and co-curricular programs are already in place, why put those students in that position?

57:06.898 --> 57:21.702
And the fact that, I will say that the relationship between the Alpine District and the Grossmont District is very good, from the superintendent's office, to the business services, to the educational services, we collaborate and articulate those students very well now.

57:22.542 --> 57:26.863
So I'll wrap up my comments with concerns about the petitioner's recommendation.

57:27.645 --> 57:33.191
They clearly recognize CDE's thorough analysis and data, then ask you to ignore it.

57:34.833 --> 57:35.734
There's a disconnect.

57:36.976 --> 57:42.402
They speak highly of the county committee, then ask you to ignore the feasibility study commissioned by that committee.

57:44.025 --> 57:57.715
They ask you to ignore CDE's interpretation of the Ed Code with regard to division of assets, and they want access to all Grossmont assets, but they don't want Grossmont to vote should it get to that stage in the process.

57:58.496 --> 58:02.699
And they ignore the concerns of declining enrollment in both districts, which is occurring.

58:04.240 --> 58:11.646
To wrap up my comments, you simply don't go build a school when you've lost more than the equivalent of a school in enrollment over the last several years.

58:12.335 --> 58:17.219
To conclude our comments, I'd like to invite Mr. Robert Shield, our board president, to the podium.

58:20.182 --> 58:20.422
Thank you.

58:23.124 --> 58:24.125
I am the board president.

58:24.185 --> 58:27.268
I thank you very much for this opportunity to speak.

58:27.728 --> 58:32.773
Besides being board president at Grossmont, I happen to be an eighth grade teacher in a neighboring district, Lakeside.

58:32.813 --> 58:34.114
And if you look at the map, they touch.

58:35.539 --> 58:44.905
And so I'm very sensitive to issues, not only as a board member, but as a teacher who watches his students every year matriculate into our schools.

58:46.346 --> 58:53.730
One of the concerns I would have is a lot of assumptions that have been made are sort of best case scenario.

58:54.871 --> 58:57.753
There's discussion about a high school of 800 students.

58:58.813 --> 59:02.375
The current eighth grade class in the Alpine district is approximately 160.

59:04.744 --> 59:07.626
And there is always attrition from the freshmen through senior year.

59:08.227 --> 59:14.472
But the one assumption that's not addressed at all is all Alpine students will stay in Alpine.

59:15.213 --> 59:32.246
We have a significant number of students in our high schools right now that are involved in swimming, diving, performing arts, IB, other programs that Alpine will not be able to offer for the foreseeable future.

59:33.027 --> 59:46.103
So I think it's unreasonable to assume that they will retain all the students because, in my opinion, many students will opt to come to our high schools the same way that even now many of their middle school students

59:47.219 --> 01:00:04.848
opt to attend neighboring middle schools because the programs that they are able to offer, but a cash-strapped elementary school district are unable to offer, as evidenced by the differential in teacher pay of Alpine versus every other district in San Diego County.

01:00:12.552 --> 01:00:13.013
Let's see.

01:00:13.433 --> 01:00:13.693
Sorry.

01:00:16.696 --> 01:00:21.520
No one is questioning the quality of the educational program being offered at Grossmont.

01:00:22.581 --> 01:00:30.767
We are doing a fantastic job of educating students throughout our district, including those students that currently reside in Alpine.

01:00:31.368 --> 01:00:32.608
That has not been challenged.

01:00:33.709 --> 01:00:38.853
The impartial voice of reason in this entire process are your experts.

01:00:39.574 --> 01:00:44.698
And we're asking you to adopt their recommendation and disapprove the Alpine unification petition.

01:00:54.181 --> 01:00:59.103
I have other notes, but I think out of respect for time, the evidence is clear.

01:01:01.104 --> 01:01:12.630
We are committed, the board, I can say the board throughout my tenure in the last 11 years, is we are committed to building a high school in Alpine when it is appropriate.

01:01:14.071 --> 01:01:20.094
As recently as 2007, there was unanimous approval, or not approval, but unanimous support

01:01:21.018 --> 01:01:27.680
for building a high school in Alpine, as at that time, there was some contention over what do we call it?

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:29.360
What is its name going to be?

01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:40.363
And that argument was among what the Alpine supporters would say is the greatest opponent to the construction of an Alpine, or to the construction of a high school.

01:01:41.224 --> 01:01:42.584
We're committed to that process.

01:01:43.643 --> 01:01:52.465
But enrollment, the demographics, especially aging demographics of Alpine, and the finances simply do not support it.

01:01:53.165 --> 01:02:09.808
Simply put, as a trustee for the Grossmont Union High School District, I cannot in good conscience support unification knowing that every single student in the district is going to pay for that unification, including the students that would remain in Alpine.

01:02:10.448 --> 01:02:11.668
So I thank you for your time.

01:02:14.619 --> 01:02:15.219
Thank you.

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:19.280
So now we will begin the public comment.

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:25.222
The board nearly always hears the public comment as well before we begin our deliberation.

01:02:25.322 --> 01:02:33.725
So staff will then identify the people to step forward in the order as the staff reads the list.

01:02:38.382 --> 01:03:00.338
Public speakers, Eric Way, Glenn Dickey, Priscilla Shriver, Roger Garay, Sal Casamassima, Colin Campbell II, Lisa Campbell, Rhonda McClavittal, George Barnett, Jessica Manning, Katie Yossi, Scott Yossi,

01:03:01.630 --> 01:03:30.551
Nick Marinovich, Sharon Haven, Albert Haven, Richard Haverstock, Nicholas Katarabic, Charles Katarabic, Neville Collin, Christine Connell, Robert Welsh, Hayden Lorry, Chris Lorry, Priscilla Schreiber, and Joseph Perricone.

01:03:32.068 --> 01:03:32.828
Please come forward.

01:03:35.809 --> 01:03:36.189
Good morning.

01:03:37.570 --> 01:03:38.410
My name is Eric Ray.

01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:40.310
I'm a trustee for the Alpine School Board.

01:03:40.330 --> 01:03:45.732
I have a letter I want to read from Diane Jacob, who is the San Diego County Board of Supervisors Chairwoman.

01:03:46.532 --> 01:03:52.174
And it reads, I would like to express my strong support for the unification of the Alpine Union School District.

01:03:52.814 --> 01:03:59.956
Unification would enable the district to add the high school and expand the grade levels being offered under AUSD from K to 8 to K to 12.

01:04:01.673 --> 01:04:06.637
It is essential to consider the importance of local control over the education of students within a community.

01:04:07.298 --> 01:04:13.783
The constituents of Alpine have a unique and specific vision for what they would like to implement and build for their students.

01:04:14.764 --> 01:04:20.889
The Alpine parents, staff, and board members are credible, forward-thinking individuals who care about the well-being of their students.

01:04:21.621 --> 01:04:31.207
I am confident that the unification and transfer of control to a new and enlarged Alpine Unified School District will better serve the community and pupils of Alpine.

01:04:31.888 --> 01:04:35.970
This is a letter of support from the Chairwoman of the Board of Supervisors.

01:04:36.771 --> 01:04:39.373
I have seen between 2002 and 2014 the support for Alpine.

01:04:39.433 --> 01:04:39.793
Thank you.

01:04:46.909 --> 01:04:47.711
Good morning, trustees.

01:04:47.871 --> 01:04:48.913
My name is Glenn Dickey.

01:04:48.933 --> 01:04:53.162
I'm an Alpine parent and the board president of the Alpine Union School District.

01:04:53.891 --> 01:05:07.258
Although the Department of Education recommends a local Alpine election area for unification vote, it cautions that a district-wide election may be needed if the State Board accepts a division of assets that veers from what the Department of Education recommends.

01:05:08.058 --> 01:05:22.185
First, such advice contradicts the CDE's own handbook, which states that a district-wide election is needed only where a local election area constituted invidious discrimination in violation of the constitutional equal protection clause.

01:05:22.785 --> 01:05:32.875
Because the CDE found no significant racial or ethnic impact arising from an Alpine unification, then a local election is called for under the DELAFCO case.

01:05:33.536 --> 01:05:36.719
Second, only a local election provides an equitable outcome.

01:05:37.139 --> 01:05:44.226
With less than 6% of the district population, Alpine would have no chance against Grossmont in a district-wide election.

01:05:44.907 --> 01:05:50.416
Rosemont has campaigned against us from the moment we filed our petition and have shown they're willing to outspend us.

01:05:51.758 --> 01:05:54.783
A district-wide election would effectively override any decision.

01:05:55.424 --> 01:05:59.951
I therefore ask for your support and the unification in the local election area.

01:06:03.716 --> 01:06:04.057
Thank you.

01:06:04.577 --> 01:06:04.977
Good morning.

01:06:05.017 --> 01:06:09.321
My name is Priscilla Schreiber, former Grossmont Board Trustee for 16 years.

01:06:09.862 --> 01:06:12.984
You have before you my written statement for your thoughtful consideration.

01:06:13.565 --> 01:06:23.233
During my tenure from 2000 to 2016, the Grossmont Board brought complete chaos and confusion to the district by making promises to Alpine they never planned on keeping.

01:06:23.774 --> 01:06:27.757
When Prop H passed, Alpine and Grossmont jointly withdrew the 2004 unification petition.

01:06:29.919 --> 01:06:33.600
When Prop U passed, the site was purchased and a campus and curriculum were designed.

01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:42.883
However, any further progress, grading, infrastructure ceased just prior to carving out the promised sports fields to benefit the families of Alpine.

01:06:43.323 --> 01:06:48.764
Building plans were secretly pulled from the Department of State Architecture and without board approval.

01:06:49.584 --> 01:06:54.346
Make no mistake, this is about denied equity, hollow promises, and failed leadership.

01:06:54.746 --> 01:06:58.387
Throw in some self-serving politicians and you have the complete breakdown.

01:06:59.227 --> 01:07:02.351
When all else fails, and it has, Alpine must unify.

01:07:02.371 --> 01:07:05.175
The grand jury agreed, as did the county committee.

01:07:05.555 --> 01:07:15.187
It is vitally important for this board to recognize the harm that Grossmont has done to Alpine, and in its prudence, grant a fair, equitable move towards unification.

01:07:15.247 --> 01:07:15.608
Thank you.

01:07:20.816 --> 01:07:23.238
Good morning, and thank you for listening to our comments.

01:07:23.759 --> 01:07:28.643
My name is Robert Welch, Jr., chairman of the Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians in Alpine.

01:07:29.123 --> 01:07:32.086
I'm in the minority category for the GUSD.

01:07:33.467 --> 01:07:37.791
The Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians supports the unification of the Alpine Union School District.

01:07:38.292 --> 01:07:46.279
Our tribe has a positive working relationship with the public schools in our area, and we are proud to send our students to K through 8 right here in our own community.

01:07:47.125 --> 01:07:56.972
The unification of the Alpine Union School District will allow the students of Alpine to continue that community pride throughout high school by enabling us to have our own school.

01:07:57.633 --> 01:08:02.116
I was privileged to go to a high school that was really small in Ramona, 600 students.

01:08:02.136 --> 01:08:04.738
200 was my graduating class.

01:08:06.159 --> 01:08:08.721
The high school was the soul of the community and the heart.

01:08:10.722 --> 01:08:12.043
We played football.

01:08:12.283 --> 01:08:13.284
The town closed.

01:08:13.364 --> 01:08:14.445
They came to watch the game.

01:08:16.701 --> 01:08:19.465
Football fell on Halloween.

01:08:20.066 --> 01:08:20.767
The stores closed.

01:08:20.808 --> 01:08:21.689
Nobody gave out candy.

01:08:21.889 --> 01:08:25.014
They went to watch the game and celebrated Halloween the next day.

01:08:25.034 --> 01:08:25.835
Time.

01:08:26.376 --> 01:08:26.677
Thank you.

01:08:32.016 --> 01:08:46.363
I'm here speaking as an individual, but a member of the Sweetwater Union High School District Bond Oversight Committee, a member of the California League of Bond Oversight Committees, and a former member of the Grossmont Bond Oversight Committee, plus 40 years of professional experience in government.

01:08:47.143 --> 01:08:51.766
The issue here is what's the most effective government structure for the students of Alpine?

01:08:53.163 --> 01:08:58.888
What particularly struck me in preparation for this hearing was the organization of the community involved.

01:08:59.348 --> 01:09:04.813
Secondly, the Grossmont bond program was not transparent and not accountable to the public.

01:09:05.313 --> 01:09:08.616
There were problems with that wanting to build the high school.

01:09:08.696 --> 01:09:11.599
I recognized it from the very start being on that committee.

01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:18.505
Finally, I want to say it's difficult to really capture the geographic isolation of Alpine.

01:09:19.625 --> 01:09:23.211
The amount of miles these students have to drive up and back is unconscionable.

01:09:23.291 --> 01:09:27.357
In closing, if you remember back in 1970, there was a governor in California.

01:09:27.377 --> 01:09:28.239
He had hair then.

01:09:28.259 --> 01:09:30.462
He said, small is beautiful.

01:09:30.663 --> 01:09:32.826
That applies to the Alpine School District.

01:09:33.026 --> 01:09:33.387
Thank you.

01:09:39.264 --> 01:09:40.345
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

01:09:40.585 --> 01:09:41.846
My name is Joseph Perricone.

01:09:41.966 --> 01:09:46.210
I'm on the Alpine School Board, as well as being chairman of the Alpine Chamber of Commerce.

01:09:47.091 --> 01:09:51.915
In those capacities, I've talked to thousands of our business people and citizens of Alpine.

01:09:52.415 --> 01:09:55.898
And I can tell you almost to the person, they're in support of a high school.

01:09:57.099 --> 01:10:01.283
Having said that, the word decline has been mentioned a lot this morning.

01:10:02.344 --> 01:10:04.686
But let me bring you to a very specific point.

01:10:06.306 --> 01:10:22.913
If voters vote for a bond and then don't get what they pay for, is that ensuring our democracy and that our voters will be heard or will it equate to decline in their confidence in our system?

01:10:23.894 --> 01:10:26.415
This is the question you must grapple with this morning.

01:10:27.295 --> 01:10:35.639
Can we, as society, go forward and have credibility if voters vote for a measure and they never get what they pay for?

01:10:37.119 --> 01:10:37.940
I thank you for your time.

01:11:14.969 --> 01:11:19.332
I won't go without it.

01:11:22.735 --> 01:11:25.537
You have a picture of what I was going to put on the screen.

01:11:27.679 --> 01:11:33.823
I'm Dr. Albert Haven, chief petitioner and former superintendent of Alpine.

01:11:35.064 --> 01:11:41.449
I also represent the 25% of the registered voters who signed our petition.

01:11:42.868 --> 01:11:57.638
Our group of citizens began in my living room 20 years ago and has since enjoyed strong community support and participation in seeking a high school and local control.

01:11:58.699 --> 01:12:10.347
For 20 years, Grossmont has consistently shown that their word cannot be trusted and that our 6% share of the district is unimportant.

01:12:11.749 --> 01:12:39.400
While we watched with dismay the board's action to again and again reprioritize Alpines High School further into the distant future, disregarding the devastating impact of hours on the bus and lost study time, their board built high-cost items not listed in the bond language, like performing arts and aquatic centers

01:12:39.958 --> 01:12:49.126
artificial turfs at all schools, you have the power to bring justice to our community today.

01:12:49.506 --> 01:12:50.067
Thank you, sir.

01:12:51.207 --> 01:12:52.368
Thank you very much for coming.

01:13:08.126 --> 01:13:10.269
I'm Colin Campbell, a chief petitioner.

01:13:10.630 --> 01:13:14.696
I represent and help collect over 4,000 Alpine resident signatures.

01:13:15.397 --> 01:13:17.700
I campaigned for three Gross Bond Prop 39 builds

01:13:19.827 --> 01:13:21.689
bonds to build an Alpine High School.

01:13:22.089 --> 01:13:25.073
The most common phrase I heard was, they will never build it.

01:13:25.453 --> 01:13:27.195
And the residents of Alpine were right.

01:13:27.615 --> 01:13:33.481
The Alpine High School is the only project within all three bonds that have contingency factors.

01:13:33.962 --> 01:13:42.331
Grossmont has 2.5 billion reasons to hold Alpine hostage, as we have the highest assessed valuation of any community within Grossmont.

01:13:42.831 --> 01:13:47.272
In lieu of Alpine's high school, bond funds were diverted to enhance every other campus.

01:13:47.752 --> 01:13:50.393
Alpine students have been neglected and unsheltered since 1921.

01:13:50.933 --> 01:13:59.095
We have been in the Grossmont District for 97 years, and we still don't have a high school for our over 18,000 residents.

01:13:59.115 --> 01:14:03.817
13 families were removed by condemnation from the 93-acre site.

01:14:04.017 --> 01:14:05.457
$23 million were wasted.

01:14:05.937 --> 01:14:11.379
Instead of a district-wide enrollment trigger, the Alpine Boundary Study and educational needs of our community should have been-

01:14:12.299 --> 01:14:19.503
Further growth is in Alpine, not the landlocked portion of Grosmont, where a campus was seriously considered for contraction.

01:14:19.644 --> 01:14:27.168
The appellate court found yesterday that Grosmont has the discretion to refuse to build the Alpine High School into perpetuity.

01:14:27.548 --> 01:14:28.949
Their 5% problem is our 100% problem.

01:14:35.376 --> 01:14:35.777
Good morning.

01:14:35.837 --> 01:14:36.778
I'm George Barnett.

01:14:36.839 --> 01:14:43.889
I'm a grandpa with four kids in the Alpine district who are the kids of a kid that could have gone to a Grossmont school.

01:14:45.011 --> 01:14:49.878
San Diego Association of Governments and the County of San Diego have commenced reprogramming of their

01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:51.920
planning updates.

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:55.763
Alpine's designated as a village growth area.

01:14:56.203 --> 01:15:01.647
Sandegg's forecasting a doubling of residential housing units over the next 20 years.

01:15:02.107 --> 01:15:03.948
I've provided a chart through your staff.

01:15:04.548 --> 01:15:06.810
We can operate a comprehensive high school.

01:15:07.230 --> 01:15:12.194
Grosvenor's Bond Promise is not a comprehensive high school.

01:15:12.674 --> 01:15:15.976
No facilities, no sports facilities, no performing arts.

01:15:16.356 --> 01:15:20.079
It was going to be operated as an adjunct to an existing high school.

01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:26.184
We already have a far superior capability and ability than the Bonzo unification.

01:15:26.745 --> 01:15:35.073
We already operate 1,000 student designed middle school with complete facilities, sports facilities, gymnasium, performing arts, and so forth.

01:15:35.493 --> 01:15:43.040
Our community groups administer sports facilities and education to 2,000 kids.

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:43.580
We're ready.

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:44.001
Thank you.

01:15:48.183 --> 01:15:49.985
Good morning, my name is Sharon Haven.

01:15:50.685 --> 01:15:56.670
I've spent some 60 years in Alpine, and I've been in a unique position to watch it mature as a community.

01:15:57.371 --> 01:15:58.732
When I came, it was a village of 2,000.

01:16:00.133 --> 01:16:02.075
No one expected it to have a high school.

01:16:02.515 --> 01:16:05.318
I went to school in El Cajon, 15 miles away.

01:16:05.418 --> 01:16:07.259
Years passed, Alpine grew.

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:15.607
There was a sadness to the fact that children who formed tight bonds in grammar school were sent off to one of four or five high schools down the hill.

01:16:16.707 --> 01:16:21.117
Whichever had room, there were no high school reunions in Alpine.

01:16:21.699 --> 01:16:25.207
Even siblings often attended different high schools and not from choice.

01:16:26.129 --> 01:16:32.570
In the late 90s, when we were a community of 13,000, we were told the next school to be built would be ours.

01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:36.891
Then Grossmont got a better deal, and Hamul and Steel Canyon was born.

01:16:37.431 --> 01:16:46.853
We are now over 18,000, and Grossmont has let us know that despite Prop H and Prop U, our best hope for a high school from them will be in 2030.

01:16:47.393 --> 01:16:49.473
Unfortunately, there won't be any money then.

01:16:50.153 --> 01:16:53.034
Our community and our children deserve better than that.

01:16:53.254 --> 01:16:54.914
Please let us unify.

01:16:59.155 --> 01:17:00.136
Thank you for your time today.

01:17:00.336 --> 01:17:03.378
My name is Jessica Manning, president of the Alpine Education Foundation.

01:17:03.859 --> 01:17:13.546
I have been fortunate the past few years to help facilitate grants in upwards of hundreds of thousands of dollars to further our district programs and our facilities.

01:17:14.026 --> 01:17:23.714
One of those being a $150,000 field that we put in one of our elementary schools that was solely produced from community support and county funding.

01:17:24.622 --> 01:17:29.126
That model is being used again currently for a $1 million project.

01:17:29.907 --> 01:17:35.652
Funds coming again outside of our district for our middle school campus to have improved fields.

01:17:37.714 --> 01:17:40.417
But more than that, I'm a mother and I feel that

01:17:41.949 --> 01:17:51.695
Our district has offered fantastic educational opportunities for my children, diverse programs that enhance that education and the facilities for my kids.

01:17:52.235 --> 01:18:01.061
I humbly ask each of you to hear our collective plea to see the heart and the leadership and the resources that we already offer and grant the opportunity for us to have our own high school.

01:18:01.361 --> 01:18:01.601
Thank you.

01:18:05.267 --> 01:18:08.128
Hello, I'm Christine Connell.

01:18:08.248 --> 01:18:15.149
In 1999, Alpine had only a 3,000 square foot library in a storefront setting and obviously needed a new library.

01:18:15.870 --> 01:18:25.312
Applications for bond funds from the state in 2004 and 2008 were unsuccessful because the state did not have Alpine as a priority.

01:18:26.352 --> 01:18:30.373
In 2009, Alpine Library Friends began to work with our local supervisor.

01:18:30.673 --> 01:18:40.335
We broke ground in 2013, and in 2015, we opened a 13,000-square-foot, award-winning, state-of-the-art library.

01:18:41.016 --> 01:18:49.117
It's lead gold, net zero, Wi-Fi, computer labs, laptops for use, books, CDs, DVDs, programs for all ages.

01:18:49.518 --> 01:18:51.038
It's absolutely marvelous.

01:18:51.698 --> 01:18:54.000
Cooperation works, we discovered.

01:18:54.480 --> 01:19:00.664
Who has a demonstrated ability to work with local officials and design-build professionals?

01:19:01.144 --> 01:19:08.049
Who can and will ensure that all monies gathered in Alpine bond payments will benefit Alpine schools?

01:19:08.109 --> 01:19:08.289
Time.

01:19:08.689 --> 01:19:10.210
Who cares most about Alpine?

01:19:10.731 --> 01:19:13.112
These guys do, and we'll get the job done.

01:19:16.690 --> 01:19:19.392
My name is Katie Yossi, and I'm the mom of a student in Alpine.

01:19:20.012 --> 01:19:21.793
Why does Alpine want and need a high school?

01:19:22.193 --> 01:19:25.035
Because a high school further defines and strengthens our community.

01:19:25.575 --> 01:19:28.177
Let me tell you about our community and why we all support a high school.

01:19:28.877 --> 01:19:39.984
I'm the vice president of a strong education foundation that supports our district with thousands of dollars every year in the form of robotics and leadership programs, a 5K, computer licenses, equipment, and summer break programs.

01:19:40.765 --> 01:19:42.566
Teachers and principals live in our neighborhoods.

01:19:43.266 --> 01:19:46.689
Our kids play after school sports together in all volunteer-based programs.

01:19:47.169 --> 01:19:57.817
When we have a family in need in our community, we set up meal schedules, we decorate businesses and streets with yellow ribbons, and we donate money and time and whatever is needed to help support that family in our community.

01:19:59.078 --> 01:20:04.602
But when our kids graduate middle school, they are immediately scattered across San Diego County to various schools.

01:20:05.203 --> 01:20:10.427
We're tired of them having to drive 15 miles minimum to football practice or a school dance.

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:14.124
We're tired of our kids dying, driving home from school.

01:20:15.466 --> 01:20:20.133
We are tired of paying bond-increased property taxes and not getting the local school that was promised.

01:20:20.794 --> 01:20:27.143
We are a good community, we are a strong community, and when we build this school, we will continue to grow and strengthen in outstanding ways.

01:20:32.622 --> 01:20:32.982
Good morning.

01:20:33.223 --> 01:20:34.144
My name is Scott Yossi.

01:20:34.705 --> 01:20:37.368
I'm a board member of the Alpine AYSO, a coach, and a parent.

01:20:38.430 --> 01:20:42.435
I went to high school in Alpine to benefit the youth athletic community and to help that community grow.

01:20:43.536 --> 01:20:45.459
Community, it's a common theme you've heard today.

01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:47.942
And our youth athletic program is a community too.

01:20:49.113 --> 01:20:50.434
Our students grow up playing together.

01:20:50.834 --> 01:20:54.036
They form strong bonds to be remembered over a lifetime.

01:20:54.816 --> 01:20:56.257
They feel pride in playing for Alpine.

01:20:57.278 --> 01:21:00.660
They deserve the chance to continue growing and competing together at an Alpine high school.

01:21:01.821 --> 01:21:07.024
In growth, Alpine youth sports are some of the only programs in East County San Diego that are growing today.

01:21:07.824 --> 01:21:12.387
A high school will act like a magnet to retain and attract more members of this community.

01:21:13.447 --> 01:21:17.070
A high school in Alpine, for youth athletics, for community, and for growth.

01:21:17.470 --> 01:21:17.730
Thank you.

01:21:22.119 --> 01:21:23.641
Hello, my name is Rhonda McLaughlin.

01:21:23.701 --> 01:21:25.322
I'm a mom, not a politician.

01:21:25.503 --> 01:21:31.549
And I helped pass the bonds two times for a high school in our community.

01:21:33.061 --> 01:21:41.089
I'm engaged with our district through the Education Foundation, Youth Sports, and PTA and will be engaged for the next five years from middle school to high school.

01:21:41.490 --> 01:21:45.474
I am president of Alpine Pop Warner and I'm treasurer of San Diego Pop Warner.

01:21:46.115 --> 01:21:53.042
Pop Warner's philosophy is that athletics and scholarships go hand in hand in developing sound character while having a good time.

01:21:53.422 --> 01:22:07.265
This year I brought Pop Warner to Alpine School District sports fields after a gross unified school district denied us home field use on fields we have paid for, punishing our football program.

01:22:07.626 --> 01:22:09.806
The kids, they won't let us play on their fields anymore.

01:22:10.346 --> 01:22:14.087
Or they will charge us $1,000 a day to play for kids.

01:22:14.767 --> 01:22:16.888
Punishing our kids because we're trying to unify.

01:22:17.768 --> 01:22:19.388
They say that that's not true.

01:22:19.889 --> 01:22:21.809
I'll drive by the field, there's nobody on it.

01:22:23.669 --> 01:22:25.802
My husband and I moved to Alpine 10 years ago.

01:22:37.418 --> 01:22:41.742
Hello, I am Hayden Laurie, and I'm a freshman at Granite Hills in Grossmont District.

01:22:42.282 --> 01:22:46.125
I attended Alpine Elementary and Joe McQueen Middle School in Alpine.

01:22:46.706 --> 01:22:55.713
In seventh and eighth grade, I participated in a brand new engineering program at Joe McQueen, which included competitions in robotics, public presentation, and mechanical design.

01:22:56.534 --> 01:23:02.216
In eighth grade, our team earned first place in an innovation competition against more than 400 middle schools.

01:23:02.776 --> 01:23:06.977
Later in the year, my school's team dominated a regional school or car competition.

01:23:07.377 --> 01:23:15.199
My team represented California for the first time at nationals, where we swept all three scoring categories among more than 800 teams nationally.

01:23:15.899 --> 01:23:20.242
Alpine schools have prepared me and my classmates for success at high school and beyond.

01:23:20.262 --> 01:23:26.366
I'm in the most rigorous courses offered at Granite Hills and my GPA after the first semester is a 4.66.

01:23:28.308 --> 01:23:36.173
We have great teachers at Granite but we are unfairly disadvantaged by one hour each day compared to our classmates.

01:23:36.894 --> 01:23:40.496
I can only imagine what more we could achieve with an extra five hours each week.

01:23:40.997 --> 01:23:41.297
Thank you.

01:23:44.787 --> 01:23:45.227
Good morning.

01:23:45.767 --> 01:23:46.747
My name is Lisa Campbell.

01:23:46.787 --> 01:23:49.208
I'm a mother, clinical psychologist and a resident of Alpine.

01:23:49.468 --> 01:23:51.248
My son is a freshman at Steel Canyon High School.

01:23:51.589 --> 01:23:53.289
This morning he woke up at 5 a.m.

01:23:53.369 --> 01:23:54.749
to take a 605 bus.

01:23:55.689 --> 01:23:59.910
On many days we choose to drive him to school so that he can have an additional 30 minutes of sleep.

01:24:00.911 --> 01:24:06.452
This drive entails us driving 17 miles of backcountry winding road through six communities,

01:24:07.745 --> 01:24:12.149
We repeat this process most afternoons, as there is no afternoon activity bus, and he plays sports.

01:24:13.290 --> 01:24:17.934
Each round trip takes us one hour, which represents many dangerous hours on the road for our family.

01:24:18.434 --> 01:24:23.879
As a mental health professional, I'm acutely aware of the critical importance of sleep.

01:24:24.439 --> 01:24:29.364
It is particularly important for adolescents, as they have a delayed sleep cycle.

01:24:30.776 --> 01:24:36.502
Healthy adolescents require nine hours of sleep or more for optimal physical, emotional, and cognitive functioning.

01:24:36.862 --> 01:24:41.447
We are asking Alpine students to drive to school many hours before they should be awake every day.

01:24:42.948 --> 01:24:49.254
Negative outcomes for teens include declines in grades and test scores in addition to many mental and physical health problems.

01:24:49.794 --> 01:24:51.356
Please carefully consider your decision.

01:24:56.523 --> 01:24:59.426
I'm Richard Hoverstock, and I support the Alpine unification.

01:24:59.707 --> 01:25:06.614
I've been the treasurer of the Alpine High School Citizens Committee for seven years, and I've been pushing for an Alpine high school for 11 years.

01:25:07.194 --> 01:25:10.878
But just as important, I'm a grandfather with three grandsons living in Alpine.

01:25:11.259 --> 01:25:12.300
I want a high school for them.

01:25:13.106 --> 01:25:22.252
Based on the curriculum designs and plans already completed, this will be a comprehensive high school and will provide my grandsons with an excellent education and preparation for college.

01:25:22.972 --> 01:25:28.675
Alpine parents are very concerned about our children busing down the hill to a high school not in our community.

01:25:29.056 --> 01:25:33.238
Our students can be traveling for more than an hour each way on a winding, dangerous road.

01:25:33.879 --> 01:25:37.221
They are at a disadvantage to other students who only travel short distances to school.

01:25:37.461 --> 01:25:40.923
Also, the longer that our children are on the road, the greater the risk of an accident.

01:25:41.563 --> 01:25:49.152
I collected many signatures door-to-door for this petition, and I have spoken personally to many Alpine citizens and grandparents, and they want this high school.

01:25:55.024 --> 01:26:01.190
Good morning, I'm Dr. Neville Connell, and before retiring I was a director of the Palo Alto Research Center.

01:26:01.951 --> 01:26:11.059
I reached this position because the 800 student high school in the small English working class town that I grew up in gave me a tremendous start.

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:15.621
In retrospect, there were two things that made my high school successful.

01:26:16.081 --> 01:26:19.662
First, excellent academic and extramural activities.

01:26:20.302 --> 01:26:22.843
Second, the efficient use of everyone's time.

01:26:23.683 --> 01:26:27.984
It was the inattention to the second of these that shocked me when I moved to Alpine.

01:26:28.524 --> 01:26:37.186
There are only a small number of hours in the day to get things done, yet Alpine students spend between two and three hours of this precious time on a school bus.

01:26:38.146 --> 01:26:41.567
This represents 30% of their school day completely wasted.

01:26:42.107 --> 01:26:49.729
Just imagine if you had to spend three hours of your working day on the school bus, what would happen to your productivity?

01:26:50.550 --> 01:26:57.072
So when I had the opportunity to vote for bonds, two of them, one of which had no demand.

01:26:57.132 --> 01:26:57.452
Time.

01:26:58.792 --> 01:27:01.873
I took it and hope you will too by voting for unification.

01:27:12.239 --> 01:27:17.523
My name is Nicholas Katteraback and I am a student at Gilmore Queen Middle School.

01:27:18.483 --> 01:27:22.406
Under the Grossmont School District I would have to get up at 5 a.m.

01:27:22.746 --> 01:27:27.569
which would give me 55 minutes to shower get dressed and eat.

01:27:27.930 --> 01:27:40.738
Whereas I and then I would have to go out of my house walk a 20 minute walk in the dark to catch a 6 15 bus which will get me to school by 730.

01:27:42.399 --> 01:27:47.325
And outside, I saw a poster that said, Serve.

01:27:47.705 --> 01:27:58.517
How is Grossmont going to serve their students' needs by having them on a bus three hours a day, five days a week?

01:27:59.638 --> 01:28:00.079
Thank you.

01:28:11.650 --> 01:28:40.605
good morning my name is roger gray i am licensed as an enrolled agent that is someone licensed by the internal revenue service to advise and represent taxpayers anywhere the i a r s exists in two thousand and two i chose the location in alpine that i've been at uh... since uh... may have that year that is my business we took over an existing business of about three hundred and forty three hundred fifty clientele and uh... just last week

01:28:41.977 --> 01:28:46.358
My office sent out over 1,400 appointment cards to our clients.

01:28:46.938 --> 01:28:50.299
The community is not declining, at least the part that I serve certainly is not.

01:28:51.959 --> 01:28:59.700
It is my sad duty to listen to folks as I sit with them every year about their concerns and their problems.

01:29:00.521 --> 01:29:04.321
And the issue that has been repeatedly mentioned here is the issue of transportation.

01:29:05.342 --> 01:29:07.582
We have a fairly well integrated community.

01:29:08.208 --> 01:29:12.413
in terms of retail and education for our lower grades.

01:29:12.933 --> 01:29:22.564
I happen to also participate in the Alpine Education Foundation, and I would like to see the voting that we did as citizens to be paid for.

01:29:23.025 --> 01:29:27.910
We are going to be paying for those bonds in Alpine for the next 40 years, whether or not we get a high school.

01:29:28.511 --> 01:29:28.731
Thank you.

01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:43.883
I'm surprised that one of the nine conditions isn't that you take into consideration what's best for the students of Alpine.

01:29:43.903 --> 01:29:44.704
Could you tell us who you are?

01:29:44.724 --> 01:29:45.924
Excuse me?

01:29:46.645 --> 01:29:47.705
Identify yourself, please.

01:29:47.885 --> 01:29:49.006
I'm Charles Katarabak.

01:29:51.367 --> 01:29:54.569
I came up here to talk about time, opportunity, and money.

01:29:55.309 --> 01:29:58.931
The time to commute to the nearest high school from Alpine can never be recovered.

01:29:59.591 --> 01:30:02.893
It's being stolen from our students, their parents, and their siblings.

01:30:03.939 --> 01:30:13.222
This loss of time robs our children of the opportunity to participate in activities surrounding high school, like swimming, band, sports, theater.

01:30:13.682 --> 01:30:17.823
You cannot do these things while you're riding in a car or riding in a bus.

01:30:18.624 --> 01:30:22.225
People outside our community will never care for our children the way we will.

01:30:22.885 --> 01:30:30.669
We are here today fighting for the right to determine the best way to spend our money to benefit our children and our community.

01:30:31.289 --> 01:30:34.471
A high school in Alpine would be one of the largest employers in town.

01:30:35.071 --> 01:30:38.533
Keeping our money in Alpine will help our community to thrive.

01:30:39.194 --> 01:30:41.695
Some people have said that we can't afford a high school.

01:30:42.375 --> 01:30:46.017
If this is true, it's because someone else took it and spent it.

01:30:47.598 --> 01:30:47.898
Thank you.

01:30:53.902 --> 01:31:00.969
Chris Laurie, equitable, reasoned, reasonable, extraordinary, discretion.

01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:04.112
These are the words strewn throughout the education code.

01:31:05.233 --> 01:31:14.442
There's only one mechanism within the education code whereby the SBE or county are empowered to construct an educational solution for Alpine using these words.

01:31:15.163 --> 01:31:17.605
This is where we are today, the unification process.

01:31:18.546 --> 01:31:29.212
The county committee dismissed the boilerplate interpretation of the division of assets by the consultant because they deemed that the code was not equitable and not reasonable in our situation.

01:31:29.912 --> 01:31:42.679
After three hearings, they used their given discretion in our extraordinary circumstance and recommended a division of assets based on equitable value of assets and liabilities, the mechanics which still need to be defined by arbitration.

01:31:43.619 --> 01:31:48.203
Please don't undermine the local controlling agency that knows the situation best.

01:31:48.904 --> 01:31:54.329
It is the same agency that in 2012 oversaw the asset allocation for our northerly neighbor, Bonzo.

01:31:54.810 --> 01:31:58.133
Please approve the county committee recommendation and send it back for methodology.

01:31:58.333 --> 01:31:58.613
Thank you.

01:32:06.601 --> 01:32:14.687
That concludes the public hearing phase and now we're into board member questions, technical questions for the staff.

01:32:16.328 --> 01:32:17.229
Board member Strauss.

01:32:18.490 --> 01:32:22.893
So I want to thank everyone for coming and sharing the background and the history.

01:32:22.914 --> 01:32:33.742
I think just as a member of the board I know we so appreciate this and we really we have some clarifying questions certainly I do but I just want to personally thank everyone who came and spent time to get here today.

01:32:34.382 --> 01:32:39.147
I just want to start by saying, clearly, you've got some emotions and some community.

01:32:39.507 --> 01:32:43.992
You've got Clara, community identity, and a long history, so Larry, I really appreciate you sharing that.

01:32:44.052 --> 01:32:50.298
It sounds like Alpine's gone on this pathway for a very long time with the belief

01:32:50.718 --> 01:32:53.720
that they were gonna get a high school and then there's been some changes along the way.

01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:56.682
And so I have quite a few clarifying questions.

01:32:56.722 --> 01:32:58.884
So I have four or five of them.

01:32:59.104 --> 01:33:04.668
The first, we heard, I was here when we heard the Bonsall hearing and several of us were.

01:33:04.728 --> 01:33:15.215
So in this case, what I'm hearing Alpine say is they are gonna take their middle school and make it a middle high school, much as Bonsall did small community also that feeds into Fallbrook.

01:33:15.675 --> 01:33:19.238
How is this situation different than the Bonsall situation?

01:33:20.879 --> 01:33:27.785
Number one, the proposal here in Alpine is not to convert a middle school.

01:33:28.126 --> 01:33:29.907
I'll talk more about that in a moment.

01:33:29.967 --> 01:33:31.008
It's to build a high school.

01:33:31.428 --> 01:33:33.470
And you've heard that throughout the conversation.

01:33:33.530 --> 01:33:36.353
So we had to put our primary focus on

01:33:37.003 --> 01:33:40.527
on the construction of a new high school in the Alpine community.

01:33:41.088 --> 01:33:42.310
Bonsall was very different.

01:33:43.131 --> 01:33:49.458
Bonsall had come to this board for a waiver of who was going to be the first board of a Bonsall Unified.

01:33:49.818 --> 01:33:52.522
Typically, it's an elected board, so you can't really

01:33:55.101 --> 01:34:03.786
use the actions of the Elementary Board to guide what's going to happen by the Bonzell Board, by the Unified Board.

01:34:04.146 --> 01:34:12.030
But Bonzell has a waiver or had a waiver from this board to allow the county superintendent to appoint

01:34:12.931 --> 01:34:26.465
the first board of Bonzell Unified and a letter from the county superintendent indicating that he would appoint the elementary school board to the Bonzell Unified board.

01:34:26.945 --> 01:34:32.871
So we gave greater weight to the Bonzell Elementary plans.

01:34:32.911 --> 01:34:35.834
They had very specific plans about how they were going to convert.

01:34:36.675 --> 01:34:37.335
the middle school.

01:34:37.776 --> 01:34:39.378
Here we, you know, we don't have that.

01:34:39.759 --> 01:34:45.587
You know, we have in Alpine, we have for the Alpine unification, the focus is on building a new high school.

01:34:46.488 --> 01:34:54.736
Further, the intent of Bonsell was not to compete with Fallbrook Union High School District in terms of a comprehensive high school.

01:34:55.236 --> 01:34:57.819
They had planned an academy-style high school.

01:34:57.939 --> 01:35:07.588
They understood that they would not be able to retain all of their students, that there would be that group of students who wanted a larger high school experience.

01:35:08.328 --> 01:35:11.071
And even though Bonsell Elementary was about 30% to 40% larger,

01:35:12.958 --> 01:35:19.856
And then the Alpine Elementary, it opened, as you heard, it opened its first year with about 65 ninth grade students.

01:35:20.555 --> 01:35:29.919
It's in its fourth or fifth year right now, and it has, I think, about 330 total high school students, and this coming from an elementary district that was larger than Alpine is right now.

01:35:30.959 --> 01:35:45.365
Larry, I'm not sure if you're going to answer this, but there's an issue of the bond, and I believe we heard White Spern's issue, which fed into Centennial Valley Union High School District, and there was a bond issue there, so that the local people were paying, and there was some agreement, or they had to work out the agreement.

01:35:45.885 --> 01:35:47.967
of what the commitment to the bond was.

01:35:47.987 --> 01:36:09.385
I mean, again, I know each of these are different, but in some ways you've got Union High School District and you've got elementaries feeding in and there's some financial issues that maybe you could help clarify about the bond commitment that they had for high schools and what the issue is if we would support the unification and whose commitment to the bond would be.

01:36:09.925 --> 01:36:13.969
I'm not sure if other board members could clarify, but I didn't understand the financial

01:36:14.769 --> 01:36:18.151
Was it that they don't agree on how much Grossmont would pay?

01:36:18.211 --> 01:36:25.514
I think there's some financial... Okay, well let me, I'm not quite sure I understand, but let me just sort of ramble for a little bit, and maybe I'll get lucky.

01:36:27.115 --> 01:36:29.676
Wiseburn was a very different animal.

01:36:29.936 --> 01:36:35.839
Wiseburn had already, as an elementary district, had already passed a bond to build a high school, so they had the funding.

01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:43.483
The issue that, you know, the complexity of the assessed valuation and the bonded indebtedness in Wiseburn

01:36:44.043 --> 01:36:54.038
was that Weisbrenner is right next to LAX, so it had a lot of the commercial, you know, the Boeings and the industry that goes along with an airport.

01:36:54.419 --> 01:36:58.645
So it had a pretty high assessed valuation relative to the other part of the Sentinella Valley.

01:37:00.546 --> 01:37:09.569
The concern that Santanella Valley had is that if you pull Wiseburn out, you pull a large portion of the bonding capacity as well as assess valuation.

01:37:10.129 --> 01:37:22.274
So they actually had special legislation that would allow the commercial assess valuation at Wiseburn to continue being applied to the Santanella Valley.

01:37:22.921 --> 01:37:26.562
high school district to get around the concerns of pulling out.

01:37:27.122 --> 01:37:29.503
They had a lot of things in place, but it was a different issue.

01:37:30.403 --> 01:37:49.928
In terms of what might happen, and specifically with Alpine, the Alpine community believes that a portion, about $70 million from the gross month, unissued bond funds,

01:37:50.518 --> 01:37:54.861
should be transferred to Alpine should it unify to construct the high school.

01:37:55.922 --> 01:38:03.388
If that happens, the debt associated with that $70 million would also transfer to Alpine.

01:38:03.968 --> 01:38:08.511
And that's something that would be in the, but again, let me back up for a moment.

01:38:08.571 --> 01:38:16.577
We don't see there's any way to do that, to require that these unissued bonds should be transferred to Alpine.

01:38:16.617 --> 01:38:18.819
But if somehow they were,

01:38:19.568 --> 01:38:25.051
The debt obligation that goes along with those funds would also transfer to Alpine.

01:38:25.591 --> 01:38:33.015
In essence, they would have to be voting on an increase in property taxes also.

01:38:34.595 --> 01:38:41.819
If those monies don't transfer, then Alpine, if it unified, would be responsible for

01:38:44.803 --> 01:38:52.587
It's pro rata share of Grossmont's current bonded indebtedness, which we based on assessed valuation.

01:38:53.328 --> 01:39:03.853
If, for example, if Alpine is 7% of the assessed valuation of Grossmont, it would have to take on 7% of the existing bonded indebtedness of Grossmont.

01:39:05.816 --> 01:39:14.699
for Alpine to build then a high school, they would have to pass a new bond because the funds wouldn't be there.

01:39:14.859 --> 01:39:26.604
And if they were to be able to pass a bond, then the debt, of course, the property taxes would go up to accommodate that increase in bond level.

01:39:28.004 --> 01:39:29.285
Is that kind of getting at where

01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:37.505
Yeah, and this assumes they would get the bond transferred from Grossmont, I mean, right?

01:39:37.525 --> 01:39:40.188
Well, they wouldn't have any funds transferred from Grossmont.

01:39:40.208 --> 01:39:41.729
They would only have the debt transferred.

01:39:41.829 --> 01:39:56.882
Yeah, and there's no way to... Okay, maybe we ought to have our liaison talk on this first, and then we can take more questions.

01:39:58.077 --> 01:40:00.699
Well, first of all, thank you to everyone who came today to speak.

01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:02.561
And thank you, Larry, and your team.

01:40:03.462 --> 01:40:07.565
It always impresses me how much you know about all these situations, you compare them.

01:40:08.666 --> 01:40:16.112
In our liaison call a while ago, I asked all sorts of detailed questions, and you always have an answer that is based on fact.

01:40:16.152 --> 01:40:17.513
And so thank you very much for that.

01:40:18.794 --> 01:40:24.959
There's one thing that Member Strauss said just a moment ago in your response I want to clarify.

01:40:26.434 --> 01:40:30.856
In a charter school petition, for example, we're going to hear several of those in just a minute.

01:40:32.256 --> 01:40:44.860
We are obligated to look at the petition itself that is submitted and not a new change to the petition that happens the day before or during public hearing or whatever.

01:40:45.441 --> 01:40:55.164
In this case, you said that you were examining this unification based upon the fact that they are asking

01:40:56.222 --> 01:40:57.804
in it to build a new high school.

01:40:58.464 --> 01:41:06.832
And yet today we heard about an alternative plan that didn't involve a new high school.

01:41:08.814 --> 01:41:11.496
What's our responsibility in that sort of situation?

01:41:12.049 --> 01:41:19.719
Well, number one, you can't force an Alpine Unified School District to convert a middle school.

01:41:20.359 --> 01:41:22.582
You can't force them to build a high school.

01:41:22.622 --> 01:41:26.467
That cannot be part of the provisions that you place in a reorganization proposal.

01:41:27.683 --> 01:41:38.031
I will back up for a moment and the issue of the cost of converting a middle school or another site in Alpine to a high school has been addressed.

01:41:38.752 --> 01:41:41.794
It was addressed in the school services of California report.

01:41:42.492 --> 01:41:44.454
to the San Diego County Committee.

01:41:44.554 --> 01:41:48.396
It was addressed in our facilities folks report.

01:41:49.397 --> 01:41:59.565
And our finding was that regardless of whether they're building a high school or they're converting a middle school or another facility, it's still going to significantly increase school housing costs.

01:41:59.585 --> 01:42:03.168
So we didn't spend much time on that because again, that wasn't part of the proposal.

01:42:03.188 --> 01:42:06.050
And there's a lot of stuff, you know, it was like 85 page report.

01:42:06.070 --> 01:42:10.153
There were a lot of stuff we didn't, for time constraints we didn't bring up.

01:42:10.894 --> 01:42:26.987
But the finding of both school services to the county committee and the finding that we have is that even if they go with that option, which is not part of the current plans, it would still constitute an increased cost in school facilities.

01:42:27.247 --> 01:42:30.510
There's a lot more than just changing the sign on a school.

01:42:31.150 --> 01:42:32.151
You have to have labs.

01:42:32.691 --> 01:42:35.774
In a high school, you're going to have to expand the parking lot.

01:42:35.814 --> 01:42:38.096
In grade, you may have to acquire more land.

01:42:38.736 --> 01:42:40.117
for the high school.

01:42:40.997 --> 01:42:44.039
If they start work, everything will have to be ADA compliant.

01:42:44.139 --> 01:42:47.721
And I'm not sure if whatever site they have currently is ADA compliant.

01:42:48.182 --> 01:42:55.265
But if they do start working construction to convert, they will have to make sure the entire site is ADA compliant.

01:42:55.666 --> 01:43:03.850
So there are a lot of costs that go into transforming an existing facility that serves elementary or middle school students into a high school facility.

01:43:07.697 --> 01:43:08.097
OK.

01:43:08.658 --> 01:43:10.619
Other board member questions?

01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:12.480
Board, pardon?

01:43:14.522 --> 01:43:15.963
Yes, board member Valdez.

01:43:16.363 --> 01:43:16.463
OK.

01:43:17.124 --> 01:43:19.045
So I want to thank everyone who came today.

01:43:19.145 --> 01:43:23.809
And I am actually in a K-8 district that has been looking at unification for years and years.

01:43:23.849 --> 01:43:30.774
So I kind of understand the sense of the community and the difficulty it is not to have a K-12 continuum of services and programs.

01:43:31.114 --> 01:43:32.295
But I just had a couple of questions.

01:43:35.501 --> 01:43:39.222
What you just asked is just that, you know, it is on the paper, on the books.

01:43:39.262 --> 01:43:41.463
We have to follow what was presented today.

01:43:41.503 --> 01:43:42.864
But there is that idea of creativity.

01:43:42.884 --> 01:43:52.347
There is nothing preventing them from going with a charter or doing something like Bonzel did and doing a specialty high school and being able to grow into a community high school.

01:43:52.367 --> 01:43:53.307
I mean, that is one option.

01:43:56.648 --> 01:44:00.851
I saw a chart that showed Grossmont's decline, but what is Alpine's decline?

01:44:00.931 --> 01:44:09.136
I heard also that it might be growing or there is projected development coming forward in the next 10 years.

01:44:11.458 --> 01:44:15.020
Alpine has been declining enrollment for at least 15 years.

01:44:15.821 --> 01:44:23.686
The most recent year for which we have data showed a slight increase, and their own demographers have indicated that

01:44:24.318 --> 01:44:29.182
enrollment, K-8 enrollment, will increase in the coming years.

01:44:29.482 --> 01:44:38.329
The San Diego County Association of Government also reports that eventually enrollments will increase.

01:44:39.871 --> 01:44:44.694
High school enrollments are going to lag behind elementary school enrollment.

01:44:44.735 --> 01:44:48.017
So yes, there is an increase, as I indicated in my presentation.

01:44:50.219 --> 01:44:52.941
Sandeg's report is that projections are that

01:44:54.702 --> 01:44:58.263
Ages 5 through 18 by 2035 will increase by 15%.

01:45:00.424 --> 01:45:07.305
As indicated by their proponents, there are plans to, there's been approvals in place for an increase in housing.

01:45:09.866 --> 01:45:14.547
Approvals for housing and actual construction of housing are two different things.

01:45:14.627 --> 01:45:18.008
In an area like Alpine, they're going to have to deal with finding water.

01:45:18.696 --> 01:45:23.118
and infrastructure, so those are issues that will have to be addressed.

01:45:24.178 --> 01:45:31.321
Additionally, one of the concerns we brought up is the 110% increase by 2035 in the 65 and older population.

01:45:31.361 --> 01:45:33.862
You can't guarantee who's going to be in those increased number of housing.

01:45:41.585 --> 01:45:52.812
The demographer who did the Alpine's enrollment projections specifically stated that Alpine, like all East County areas, has a number of problems with enrollment growth.

01:45:53.713 --> 01:45:56.134
One is the lack of available housing.

01:45:58.076 --> 01:45:59.897
Petitioners have addressed that to some degree.

01:46:00.437 --> 01:46:03.019
Two is the lack of a job base in Alpine.

01:46:03.618 --> 01:46:06.640
and other East County communities.

01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:13.623
And three is the distance that people in Alpine would have to travel for those jobs.

01:46:14.183 --> 01:46:20.487
So those were three concerns that Alpine's own demographer brought up when they did the enrollment projections.

01:46:22.248 --> 01:46:22.988
Does that answer?

01:46:23.479 --> 01:46:25.300
Just one last clarification question.

01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:34.265
So if they pulled the high school and it was a $45 million cost, they're also not going to have to go into the CEQA costs and all of those other, the report costs, is that correct?

01:46:34.325 --> 01:46:38.027
Well, the CEQA costs have to be, would have to be addressed up front.

01:46:38.888 --> 01:46:45.972
There are two types of CEQA, and I'm not sure where Grossmont is in CEQA costs for the actual construction of the high school.

01:46:46.372 --> 01:46:48.213
There may be some additional costs for that.

01:46:48.773 --> 01:46:56.701
But the CEQA costs for which we're concerned are the costs for the unification project itself, which is different.

01:46:57.802 --> 01:47:06.170
And those costs are, you are the lead agency for CEQA in a unification proposal.

01:47:06.550 --> 01:47:11.595
And those costs, as your past practice has been, will have to be borne by local agencies.

01:47:12.975 --> 01:47:21.821
And no one right now has come forward with the willingness to address those costs.

01:47:22.561 --> 01:47:25.423
One would assume that would almost have to be Alpine Elementary.

01:47:25.503 --> 01:47:35.830
But again, no one's really addressed who's going to be responsible for the local cost of a CEQA review of the unification proposal as a project under CEQA.

01:47:38.312 --> 01:47:38.632
OK.

01:47:38.852 --> 01:47:39.613
Patricia Rucker.

01:47:40.785 --> 01:47:42.226
Hi Larry, how are you this morning?

01:47:43.026 --> 01:47:59.117
I also want to, these are the kinds of hearings that become very difficult to go through because there's so many different perceptions about a number of the factors and one of the concerns that I'm confused about is the bond

01:47:59.657 --> 01:48:02.458
and is the debt or what the indebtedness currently is.

01:48:02.798 --> 01:48:06.079
There were several statements that were made here that stood out to me.

01:48:06.359 --> 01:48:13.141
One is that the district currently is in deficit spending with their budget, but at the same time, I am hearing

01:48:16.142 --> 01:48:29.527
from members in the community, some perception that there is a deposit or a cash of funds for doing this building that Grossmont seems to have.

01:48:30.228 --> 01:48:33.829
And so this is where I started getting confused.

01:48:34.349 --> 01:48:36.130
I understand what you explained that

01:48:36.870 --> 01:48:45.317
if the approval to do the unification goes forward, there is going to be a transfer of something.

01:48:45.818 --> 01:48:53.804
And so what I'm hearing that seems to be confusing me is there is a perception on one side of this table that there would be a transfer of asset.

01:48:54.245 --> 01:48:58.889
But I believe what I heard you say is that there would be an actual transfer of debt.

01:48:59.189 --> 01:49:01.251
There wouldn't actually be new money.

01:49:01.291 --> 01:49:02.712
It would be a transfer of debt.

01:49:03.272 --> 01:49:05.374
from that existing bond.

01:49:05.654 --> 01:49:07.335
Could you clarify that for me?

01:49:08.376 --> 01:49:21.505
In any provision to divide Grossmont's funds, property, obligations, et cetera, we're going to look at a number of things.

01:49:22.565 --> 01:49:30.531
In terms of real property, real property that's in Grossmont and the remaining portion of Grossmont will become property of Grossmont.

01:49:32.048 --> 01:49:44.934
The property that Grossmont has in Alpine is this Lazy A site that they purchased back in 2000 or acquired back in 2009 and have done some preliminary work with.

01:49:45.274 --> 01:49:46.615
That would become property.

01:49:47.205 --> 01:49:49.887
of the new Alpine Unified School District.

01:49:50.448 --> 01:49:51.248
That's real property.

01:49:51.909 --> 01:49:56.772
Then there are the other funds and obligations of... I want to be sure.

01:49:56.792 --> 01:50:07.100
So the property is an asset that would transfer over to this new unified... If it's part, if it's geographically located with the Unified School District.

01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:07.280
Okay.

01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:07.540
All right.

01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:08.421
I'm tracking.

01:50:08.501 --> 01:50:08.961
Okay.

01:50:08.981 --> 01:50:12.624
So the education code specifically pulls out real property from

01:50:13.344 --> 01:50:20.372
any proposal or any plan to divide assets that you as the State Board That's where I got lost.

01:50:20.392 --> 01:50:24.777
So real property is gone from those considerations.

01:50:25.257 --> 01:50:31.504
In our interpretation of the Education Code, you cannot decide that a high school in Grossmont, for example, can be

01:50:33.399 --> 01:50:35.420
on the ledger side of an Alpine unified.

01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:35.781
Got it.

01:50:35.881 --> 01:50:37.842
That's where I got lost in the conversation.

01:50:37.862 --> 01:50:37.902
OK.

01:50:37.942 --> 01:50:47.688
So when you talk about division of assets, division of property funds and obligations, the Education Code explicitly excludes real property from that.

01:50:48.749 --> 01:50:49.029
OK.

01:50:49.329 --> 01:51:02.318
So Alpine would get some portion of Grossmont's fine funds if there are some bond funds in capital or bond monies in capital project funds.

01:51:02.844 --> 01:51:08.207
then Alpine Unified would get a pro rata based on the assessed valuation share of that.

01:51:08.747 --> 01:51:21.675
Other funds that come from the general funds and that sort of thing that Grossmont has, Alpine would be due a share of that, likely based on their pro rata share of enrollment.

01:51:23.181 --> 01:51:32.583
The other piece that I heard very clearly from you is right now the Unified School District could not afford another bond.

01:51:32.783 --> 01:51:33.524
Is that correct?

01:51:35.624 --> 01:51:38.285
I forget the exact dollar amount.

01:51:38.305 --> 01:51:40.225
It is in the report.

01:51:41.065 --> 01:51:44.386
They would have some bond cap available.

01:51:45.086 --> 01:51:46.607
Our concern is twofold.

01:51:46.787 --> 01:51:47.727
One, it is not enough.

01:51:48.447 --> 01:51:59.336
to cover the cost of a high school and two, the Alpine community has not in the past showed a willingness to access the bond, you know, to pass a bond measure.

01:51:59.576 --> 01:52:08.944
And so that was the other place where I got confused because there were people who testified who seemed to think they already have a bond in existence that would pay for this.

01:52:09.204 --> 01:52:09.344
Right.

01:52:09.384 --> 01:52:12.127
And that's, that's the issue of it's a Grossmont bond.

01:52:12.227 --> 01:52:12.547
Okay.

01:52:12.567 --> 01:52:12.887
Got it.

01:52:13.108 --> 01:52:24.238
So Grossmont does have at any given point in time, it has the funds, the bond funds that it's issued and are using to fund modernization and maintenance of existing school sites.

01:52:25.099 --> 01:52:26.500
But it's, it's, it's like a credit card.

01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:33.967
You know, when the, when, when, um, when the voters approve a bond, they give you a credit limit that you can spend.

01:52:34.508 --> 01:52:36.669
And as you issue bonds, that becomes debt.

01:52:37.310 --> 01:52:46.896
So what I think many of the proponents are talking about is that Grossmont still has this credit limit there, these bond funds that they haven't issued yet.

01:52:48.297 --> 01:52:53.500
And that's what they see as the source of funding for a new Alpine high school.

01:52:54.060 --> 01:53:01.325
But again, our opinion is that the Education Code does not allow those funds to be divided and transferred.

01:53:06.004 --> 01:53:06.585
Great, thank you.

01:53:09.007 --> 01:53:11.789
OK, board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

01:53:14.311 --> 01:53:28.063
So what I heard also in terms of Alpine residents feeling that they had a bond is because it seems like they campaigned and actively worked to pass this bond for Grossmont, right?

01:53:28.403 --> 01:53:32.887
So when you look at Prop U, it says that there's going to be modernization, but

01:53:34.628 --> 01:53:38.251
it says constructing a new school in Alpine Blossom Valley.

01:53:38.812 --> 01:53:54.825
So I think that here is definitely an issue of trust because they were to pass this bond thinking that they were going to get a high school but the devil's in the details and when you unpackage this bond there is a trigger number that has to be met to get that high school.

01:53:55.325 --> 01:54:02.974
And so, unless you're in the weeds of the proposition, you may not know that in order to get that high school, there's a trigger number.

01:54:03.354 --> 01:54:16.569
But you're under the assumption that because you worked and did the walking and knocking the doors to get this bond pass, and they told you, and it's in the header, that you're going to get a high school.

01:54:17.029 --> 01:54:26.859
And so I feel for that because I do think that this is a community that worked to pass this bond and at the end of the day didn't get the high school.

01:54:27.459 --> 01:54:37.389
And I feel for the students that have to get on that bus for an hour each way, because I'm a commuter in downtown LA and I know how that feels, as an adult to have to endure a three hour round trip.

01:54:38.490 --> 01:54:48.579
And when I looked at, and I don't know that we have a lot of power here to say, because now there is a number that we have to work and we need to be responsible for what we're approving here.

01:54:49.139 --> 01:55:00.269
But when you look at your chronic absenteeism rate, Grossmont, you have a higher chronic absenteeism than most of the surrounding districts, 15 point something.

01:55:00.869 --> 01:55:06.695
And it's alarming to me when you look at your Native American population, which is at 25% of that.

01:55:07.015 --> 01:55:11.459
So there is something that you have to look at when you're looking at the students that you're serving.

01:55:11.859 --> 01:55:15.543
And that commute may be accounting for that chronic absenteeism.

01:55:15.623 --> 01:55:18.786
I can't see it by school, because I know there's two feeder schools that you have.

01:55:19.266 --> 01:55:25.849
But there is definitely something there, that data point that you have to look at, and then look at the students that are most impacted.

01:55:27.510 --> 01:55:37.575
So I invite you to do that analysis, regardless of the outcome of this meeting, to really understand your student demographic and look at who are the students that are not coming to school.

01:55:38.456 --> 01:55:40.897
Because it may be your students coming from Alpine.

01:55:41.838 --> 01:55:48.281
So I have a question, though, about the third option of delaying our action here.

01:55:49.594 --> 01:55:55.488
You said that as the lead agency, we would then decide who pays for the CEQA study?

01:55:56.049 --> 01:55:58.716
No, under the delay, nothing would happen at all.

01:56:00.110 --> 01:56:04.833
You would just decide as a board, well, we're not ready to take action on this.

01:56:05.433 --> 01:56:09.736
We think that there is more information we want to gather or more information that's forthcoming.

01:56:10.236 --> 01:56:24.406
The second option, I think, is the one you're addressing, which is that you consider the proposal to have merit, and then you will move on to the next step, asking the local community to take that CEQA step.

01:56:26.707 --> 01:56:38.540
Under the public resources code, the cost for CEQA can be billed by the lead agency to the proponents of a project.

01:56:38.860 --> 01:56:40.522
In this case, it's the chief petitioners.

01:56:41.002 --> 01:56:47.089
Now, that's kind of a difficult thing to ask three community members in Alpine to fund the cost of CEQA.

01:56:47.529 --> 01:56:59.573
So in the past, what the practice of this board has been is that you don't direct anybody, you can't direct anybody to pay for it, but you simply say CEQA has to be taken care of.

01:57:00.333 --> 01:57:01.534
We are the lead agency.

01:57:01.954 --> 01:57:06.235
It must be conducted under our supervision.

01:57:07.256 --> 01:57:09.936
So local folks, work it out.

01:57:11.417 --> 01:57:13.758
And then do we set a time period for that?

01:57:13.998 --> 01:57:14.798
There's no time frame.

01:57:16.027 --> 01:57:23.555
Okay, so delaying action, do we anticipate any additional information that would change?

01:57:24.256 --> 01:57:33.827
I mean, other than the population trends, you've said it, there seems to be an increase, but the housing units or housing projects are just that, they're planned.

01:57:34.708 --> 01:57:49.649
I'm wondering if, and I know, you know, it's already happened, but when Prop U was passed, that was 2008, there had to be some projections, 10 years out at least, and Grosmont knew that if you build another high school, you're going to lose students.

01:57:50.069 --> 01:57:53.612
I mean, they knew that when they put that on the ballot.

01:57:54.493 --> 01:57:57.755
So, for me, that point's irrelevant at this point.

01:57:57.815 --> 01:57:58.396
You knew that.

01:57:58.456 --> 01:58:01.458
You planned to lose students when you were going to open another school.

01:58:01.859 --> 01:58:07.643
But did they not see the projections that the student enrollment projections at that time?

01:58:07.743 --> 01:58:11.927
I don't know specifically what was going on, you know, 10 years ago when, or

01:58:12.726 --> 01:58:14.468
12 years ago, 14 years ago.

01:58:14.908 --> 01:58:18.931
But, you know, the Grossmont folks are here.

01:58:19.131 --> 01:58:22.074
And if you wanted to ask them to clarify, you can.

01:58:22.094 --> 01:58:24.576
I mean, it's definitely a trust issue at this point.

01:58:25.577 --> 01:58:32.722
Certainly, all school districts do housing projections and have five-year, 10-year plans or whatever.

01:58:32.782 --> 01:58:41.129
So, you know, we did not look at those, so I'm not sure what any school district had in front of them 12 years ago.

01:58:43.377 --> 01:58:44.958
that they say we're going to lose students.

01:58:44.998 --> 01:58:51.359
Well, you knew that when you propose a new school, a high school you're going to some of your students, and there's a decline in enrollment.

01:58:51.879 --> 01:58:57.881
You had a projection, a student enrollment projection, and when you pass a bond that's part of what you look at.

01:58:58.061 --> 01:59:00.441
You look to see is there a need for this in the future.

01:59:05.615 --> 01:59:16.724
I think at some point we have to get back to, you know, where Grossmont's made comments about their priorities for this bond money and we need to get back to that at some point.

01:59:16.804 --> 01:59:17.045
Go ahead.

01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:19.301
I actually had two questions.

01:59:19.481 --> 01:59:25.706
One I think might be for Grossmont, Larry, but the first one, I'm trying to clarify back to board member Holliday's point.

01:59:26.427 --> 01:59:36.896
This issue that was raised today about the Alpine community has a middle school site that they think could house a high school is a new issue as I understand it.

01:59:37.116 --> 01:59:37.937
Well, not really.

01:59:37.997 --> 01:59:41.720
It was brought up at the, during the county committee consideration.

01:59:42.301 --> 01:59:45.744
The school services report looked at that issue.

01:59:47.585 --> 01:59:52.850
But, again, like us, they were looking at a proposal that contemplated a new high school.

01:59:53.978 --> 02:00:09.646
They did indicate in their analysis that even if there is this excess capacity available at Alpine, they could explore a less expensive option to provide a secondary program in terms of converting or using existing sites.

02:00:10.106 --> 02:00:16.529
But they still found that such conversion would result in an increase in facilities costs.

02:00:16.569 --> 02:00:18.330
Therefore, the condition would not be met.

02:00:18.830 --> 02:00:22.451
That's pretty much the finding that our facilities folks said.

02:00:23.072 --> 02:00:27.133
We didn't focus on that because that was not part of the proposal.

02:00:28.153 --> 02:00:40.638
Certainly, going back to the County Committee, that was their recommendation, that this condition is met only if the Alpine Unified School District used existing facilities to house high school students.

02:00:41.598 --> 02:01:00.195
But, again, in our report, even though we've been talking about building a new high school because that's what everyone's talking about and that's what part of the petition is about, we found that even converting a middle school would mean that this condition is not substantially met.

02:01:01.755 --> 02:01:11.078
So just to follow up on board member Ortiz-Lincoln's line of questioning, this issue of 10 years ago, what was the enrollment projection for Alpine?

02:01:11.478 --> 02:01:13.099
And it sounds like they did not meet it.

02:01:13.179 --> 02:01:14.119
They have not met it.

02:01:14.739 --> 02:01:16.700
That's why we're at this point, right?

02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:17.000
So.

02:01:17.140 --> 02:01:17.320
Right.

02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:22.422
The enrollment, as you saw in the graph, peaked in 2009, 2010 year.

02:01:22.462 --> 02:01:24.123
And then since then, it's been on a decline.

02:01:24.243 --> 02:01:24.323
OK.

02:01:24.603 --> 02:01:30.025
And also, may I just add to that, a court, we had a full court hearing and a court just ruled on this.

02:01:31.945 --> 02:01:33.126
Can you comment on that?

02:01:34.246 --> 02:01:54.854
You know, beyond what our attorney has, you know, I might have to bring them up, but basically bring him up again, but simply put, the Court of Appeal decision affirmed the trial court's decision that under current circumstances, which are declining enrollment, that the enrollment trigger has not been met.

02:01:55.374 --> 02:02:16.306
that there are fiscal costs to opening a school, that Grossmont can consider when using its discretion to decide whether or not to build the school, that Grossmont High School District is under no obligation under the current circumstances, those circumstances of enrollment decline and fiscal issues, to build a high school at this time.

02:02:16.326 --> 02:02:20.028
Okay, Board Member Sun.

02:02:22.370 --> 02:02:30.474
So when I read this item and I looked at the staff analysis, I was actually going to go with the staff recommendation.

02:02:30.694 --> 02:02:45.100
And after hearing the proponents of the unification, so my bias is that school buildings don't make schools.

02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:48.301
Heart, mind, and spirit make schools.

02:02:51.702 --> 02:03:07.617
And what I'm finding is that all of this analysis, what the court is doing is looking at comparing, looking at the cost of building a high school based on our very traditional way of looking at what a high school is.

02:03:08.337 --> 02:03:15.482
And I believe that this community does not need a high school with an Olympic pool and huge football stadium.

02:03:15.582 --> 02:03:21.866
They want a high school program that best serves their students and their student needs.

02:03:22.507 --> 02:03:26.509
And after hearing the petition, I feel like they can do it.

02:03:26.689 --> 02:03:33.214
And there are other ways of building a high school program than the construction of what we're talking about here.

02:03:33.774 --> 02:03:35.876
So that's my thought.

02:03:36.276 --> 02:03:37.877
Well, just in response, certainly,

02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:47.646
Certainly, those are options that have been discussed at the local level, as well as issues that we've looked at here.

02:03:47.666 --> 02:03:49.648
As I said, the petition itself

02:03:52.873 --> 02:04:04.519
And as you've heard by proponents, and even throughout the course of local consideration of this, the primary focus is on building that high school.

02:04:04.919 --> 02:04:11.083
The focus has been on obtaining Grossmont funds to fund the construction of the high school.

02:04:11.123 --> 02:04:17.126
That was the whole point of the litigation that we looked at yesterday.

02:04:17.686 --> 02:04:20.988
So we can't make changes to a petition.

02:04:21.769 --> 02:04:26.619
That's what the petition asked for, a high school.

02:04:27.481 --> 02:04:31.769
You cannot tell an Alpine Unified School District that you cannot build a high school.

02:04:32.552 --> 02:04:33.392
if we approve this.

02:04:34.013 --> 02:04:38.995
That's left up to the new governing board of the Unified School District.

02:04:39.495 --> 02:04:41.716
So certainly, certainly there are options out there.

02:04:43.257 --> 02:04:45.958
And we have looked at those options to some degree.

02:04:46.478 --> 02:04:57.923
And we still, even under those circumstances, as I said, both the school services report for the county committee as well as our fiscal, our facilities folks have found that there are significant

02:04:58.965 --> 02:05:04.692
increase costs to providing something at the local level using existing facilities.

02:05:06.995 --> 02:05:12.362
Certainly, our role is to focus on these threshold conditions.

02:05:12.943 --> 02:05:15.286
Your role is to decide whether or not

02:05:16.263 --> 02:05:17.624
they're that relevant or not.

02:05:17.965 --> 02:05:34.219
And you can use compelling reasons, as you've been discussing, to say, okay, even if this condition is not met, even if there are significant increased costs as a result of approving this unification proposal, we think there are compelling enough circumstances to move it forward.

02:05:34.619 --> 02:05:35.520
That's your role.

02:05:36.401 --> 02:05:36.781
Thank you.

02:05:36.801 --> 02:05:38.523
Board Member Williams.

02:05:40.390 --> 02:05:47.392
Well, I'm finding myself sympathetic with board member Ortiz-Lacon and Ting.

02:05:48.112 --> 02:05:48.892
Oh, son.

02:05:49.872 --> 02:05:51.973
I'm sorry, going back and forth between first and last names.

02:05:54.433 --> 02:06:00.155
Sympathetic to the problems, the challenges that Alpine is facing.

02:06:00.915 --> 02:06:07.440
And I'm no expert in all of the bond stuff and all of the rules and all the court cases and stuff like that.

02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:15.125
But my sense as I hear this is how important it is to Alpine

02:06:16.345 --> 02:06:18.226
There are a lot of things important to Alpine.

02:06:19.927 --> 02:06:29.511
The ideal, I'm sure, for Alpine is give us some bond money and let us build a full comprehensive high school of our own, and we'll figure out how to do it and how to fund it.

02:06:29.771 --> 02:06:31.412
That's like the ideal scenario.

02:06:31.832 --> 02:06:40.856
But if you don't get the ideal, whether it's because of these threshold issues and all of that stuff, if the ideal is not possible, then what's the tweener?

02:06:41.536 --> 02:06:59.917
What's the thing in between that may get a kind of school, which may or may not, as you were saying, may not be a full campus, may not even actually be necessarily part of the middle school building facility, but could be use of another facility within

02:07:01.239 --> 02:07:17.354
within the town, could be a dependent charter school, could be, I don't know that those options, once you let go of the ideal and you're willing to kind of think outside that box and think, okay, what else could we do that would allow

02:07:18.015 --> 02:07:44.476
Students that want to stay in a high school in Alpine stay, and those that are willing to go ahead and ride the bus so they can have after-school programs and swim and be on the soccer team and all of that stuff, it might mean that some of their kids go to Grossmont and some of their kids stay for a different kind of high school experience in Alpine, but at least there would be an option where now all the options are long-distance driving.

02:07:45.136 --> 02:07:55.082
and all of the concerns that were raised about time on the road, time on the curvy roads, time taken away from what you could be doing otherwise as parents as well as students.

02:07:56.423 --> 02:08:07.426
Even the whole issue of getting up that early in the morning to get to school, there's plenty of research that indicates that that is not healthy in any way for students in terms of loss of sleep.

02:08:08.006 --> 02:08:21.591
So my sympathies are with seeing if there's a way, if they were interested in trying to explore further other options, if there's a way for us to move forward to let that happen.

02:08:22.171 --> 02:08:22.771
Well, certainly.

02:08:26.584 --> 02:08:27.846
Certainly there are options out there.

02:08:29.488 --> 02:08:40.021
The problem that we have is that who is going to tell you that this district can follow those, what your recommendation is.

02:08:40.381 --> 02:08:45.387
We don't have a board for an Alpine Unified School District.

02:08:46.243 --> 02:08:49.906
We don't necessarily have a superintendent for an Alpine Unified School District.

02:08:49.926 --> 02:08:57.271
The current superintendent is not assured a position with the new Unified School District.

02:08:57.751 --> 02:08:59.973
The superintendent will be determined by this new board.

02:09:01.173 --> 02:09:02.794
We cannot get any assurances.

02:09:03.655 --> 02:09:07.077
from anyone locally that they're going to follow some alternative.

02:09:07.877 --> 02:09:22.885
Certainly, the elementary school district now has the option to work on getting a charter school, charter high school, that may address some of the issues, but I have not heard a whole lot of conversation around that option.

02:09:24.046 --> 02:09:28.548
That's something that the current board, the current administration could explore.

02:09:29.108 --> 02:09:35.431
But, again, we haven't seen much around that discussion.

02:09:35.851 --> 02:09:42.154
But maybe that's because they were going for gold, and now we're looking for a different kind of option, and if they had more time, they could find one.

02:09:42.554 --> 02:09:42.934
Certainly.

02:09:42.994 --> 02:09:43.354
Certainly.

02:09:43.394 --> 02:09:50.137
And that's one of the reasons why we gave you the option, the third option, is to just delay and see.

02:09:52.558 --> 02:09:54.639
I'm going to back up for a moment.

02:09:55.239 --> 02:10:05.003
We spent a lot of time here deciding whether or not we were going to recommend that the State Board delay hearing this because there were a lot of unanswered questions.

02:10:05.904 --> 02:10:13.047
The primary reason that we decided to bring it to the Board is, as I mentioned in the report,

02:10:15.175 --> 02:10:22.423
this divide between how Grossmont's assets would be divided at the local level.

02:10:23.564 --> 02:10:30.151
Grossmont is stating that you can't use our credit limit, our unissued bonds.

02:10:30.671 --> 02:10:31.392
We agree with that.

02:10:31.912 --> 02:10:38.139
But the Alpine community was saying, no, we need those bonds to move forward with our plans.

02:10:39.657 --> 02:10:56.787
We decided that would be in the best interest for everybody locally is if we went on record and perhaps the State Board could go on record as saying here's what we think the division of assets should look like and here's what you're going to have if this new district is formed.

02:10:58.629 --> 02:11:00.650
That was the primary purpose and not delaying.

02:11:01.250 --> 02:11:07.214
So I think we've done that and I'll throw it back to you.

02:11:10.301 --> 02:11:14.163
Yes, I would like maybe if we get a motion on the floor.

02:11:14.183 --> 02:11:17.385
Board member Holliday was our liaison here.

02:11:17.405 --> 02:11:22.588
Thank you to all the board members for all your comments and questions.

02:11:22.648 --> 02:11:26.290
I am very, very sympathetic to the Alpine community in this situation.

02:11:27.494 --> 02:11:34.236
I think as member Ortiz-Lacombe said, trust has been broken and that's a very sad thing in a community.

02:11:36.197 --> 02:11:45.379
I am concerned about the financial obligation should we, that will be put onto Alpine, should we go ahead and approve this unification.

02:11:45.399 --> 02:11:47.600
I am concerned, deeply concerned about that.

02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:49.661
I do think it is our responsibility.

02:11:51.441 --> 02:11:57.828
to be as fiscally prudent as possible in these sorts of situations, and that is a serious concern that I have.

02:11:58.749 --> 02:12:07.578
I have been through the process, literally, of converting an elementary school into a middle high school, and it is a very expensive proposition.

02:12:11.321 --> 02:12:20.888
I really wish someone along all these years had put together a charter high school in this community because I think it could have solved a lot of issues.

02:12:20.988 --> 02:12:35.300
I think it also could have given the community a real look at what their students want, whether they demand the full-blown high school with a swimming pool and the track and field and football team and all the rest, or whether

02:12:36.341 --> 02:12:45.454
an alternative form of high school such as a charter school might have been really a good thing for the community.

02:12:47.152 --> 02:12:59.995
I would like to ask a procedural question before I make a motion, and that is if a motion does not pass here, what happens at that point?

02:13:00.035 --> 02:13:09.837
For example, if either for the invocation or against, if there is not if that first initial motion does not pass procedurally, what happens next?

02:13:10.693 --> 02:13:11.974
I'll take that, Larry.

02:13:12.574 --> 02:13:27.402
So what would happen if an initial motion does not pass, another board member could bring a different motion, and until there are no motions on the floor, if no motion carries, ultimately the hearing would end with no action by the board.

02:13:30.704 --> 02:13:33.105
But the item is still active in front of the board, though.

02:13:34.426 --> 02:13:36.207
It would essentially just be sitting here.

02:13:37.879 --> 02:13:40.360
It would be up to this board to bring it back at some point.

02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:46.002
It would be up to local folks to say, OK, we think conditions have changed.

02:13:46.042 --> 02:13:50.864
We're ready to bring another proposal forward or another explanation of issues.

02:13:53.305 --> 02:13:57.746
Maybe there are some negotiations between Grossmont and Alpine that could take place.

02:13:58.166 --> 02:14:03.168
Maybe special legislation, like in Wiseburn, could be obtained.

02:14:06.469 --> 02:14:10.031
If you don't take action here, it's just simply like delaying action.

02:14:10.091 --> 02:14:11.471
It doesn't go away.

02:14:11.611 --> 02:14:12.111
It's still here.

02:14:13.752 --> 02:14:14.432
Yeah, okay.

02:14:15.073 --> 02:14:16.333
Board Member Williams is next.

02:14:17.154 --> 02:14:31.779
I just want to make sure, you gave as an illustration voting, making a motion to approve unification or not, but isn't one of the options to delay the decision and give time for more communication and planning?

02:14:31.799 --> 02:14:32.320
Okay.

02:14:36.293 --> 02:14:37.994
Put the options up again, please.

02:14:39.094 --> 02:14:39.734
Oh, it went away.

02:14:41.595 --> 02:14:44.876
Board member Strauss, then I'd like to get a motion on the floor.

02:14:44.916 --> 02:14:49.157
So I just want to follow up on what member Sung and member Williams was saying.

02:14:49.837 --> 02:14:58.240
So if they don't go for the gold because financially there's a problem with build and they decide they want to go for to convert the middle high school.

02:15:00.781 --> 02:15:25.591
I'm just thinking, I'm not sure how we're gonna go on this, but if that's what they say, okay, we can't get a whole separate high school, but we could go, is the best, is one strategy then to allow them time to come back with a different proposal that would then have different financial implications, or, you gave us several options, Larry, and I'm just trying to say, to me, it sounds like they,

02:15:26.767 --> 02:15:38.511
there's some real reasons why we should support their ability to maybe try a smaller one, or do they have to go completely back and start with a charter high school, and so then we say no, or we say nothing and they come back.

02:15:38.571 --> 02:15:40.811
I'm just trying to figure out the options.

02:15:41.071 --> 02:15:45.433
You're dealing with a specific recommendation from the County Board of Education, the County Committee.

02:15:46.013 --> 02:15:47.693
That's what you take action on.

02:15:49.674 --> 02:15:52.315
So if you delay action and

02:15:53.415 --> 02:15:58.678
and allow negotiations, allow special legislation, allow people to gather more data.

02:15:59.318 --> 02:16:02.740
You're still dealing with that recommendation on that petition.

02:16:03.221 --> 02:16:05.962
The process of reorganization starts with a petition.

02:16:06.282 --> 02:16:10.324
Now, certainly, the Alpine community could go back and start a new petition.

02:16:11.145 --> 02:16:17.528
Or Grossmont and Alpine could get together and bring a joint proposal for something else.

02:16:17.548 --> 02:16:18.049
But nothing that

02:16:23.055 --> 02:16:36.900
that the community is going to do in the interim, nothing that the districts are going to do in the interim, is going to change the fact that the proposal you have now is what's in front of you.

02:16:37.500 --> 02:16:38.941
You don't have authority to change that.

02:16:39.679 --> 02:16:41.601
School districts don't have authority to change that.

02:16:42.102 --> 02:16:44.384
Chief petitioners don't have authority to change that.

02:16:44.844 --> 02:16:53.053
This petition, this proposal is what was brought forward by voters by petition in the district.

02:16:53.293 --> 02:16:56.917
The only way to change what's in there is to bring a new voter petition forward.

02:16:57.758 --> 02:17:01.862
Yeah, I'm going to ask board member Holliday to make a motion and then we can talk from that.

02:17:02.318 --> 02:17:02.658
Thank you.

02:17:03.680 --> 02:17:09.726
Once again, I feel deeply about this break in trust.

02:17:09.807 --> 02:17:12.950
I feel deeply for the Alpine community.

02:17:13.751 --> 02:17:15.373
I do believe that the CDE

02:17:17.190 --> 02:17:19.371
has done a thorough review of this.

02:17:19.691 --> 02:17:22.052
I am concerned about the financial implications.

02:17:23.592 --> 02:17:37.778
And I do hope that the Grossmont Unified School Board will understand that there are fences to be mended and there's a lot of work to be done to bring this community back together again.

02:17:37.838 --> 02:17:39.218
And I pray that that can happen.

02:17:39.579 --> 02:17:45.861
However, I will vote, pardon me, I will make a motion to recommend the CDE's recommendation.

02:17:46.795 --> 02:17:47.776
Is there a second on that?

02:17:48.137 --> 02:17:48.477
Second.

02:17:49.299 --> 02:17:50.640
Okay, I haven't spoken.

02:17:50.700 --> 02:18:01.255
So I would say on this, I support the motion that this is a long complex situation that's gone on for years.

02:18:02.421 --> 02:18:13.394
And I don't think this board has heard enough information about the complex local situation to overturn the CDE recommendation.

02:18:14.095 --> 02:18:15.877
We've heard some people from the community.

02:18:16.337 --> 02:18:18.300
We've heard of converting a middle school.

02:18:18.360 --> 02:18:20.842
We got very little information on that.

02:18:22.564 --> 02:18:32.272
And if we did, if we approve Board Member Holiday's motion, the community is free to come back with another petition to their County Committee.

02:18:33.513 --> 02:18:50.306
So rather than us getting in the middle of negotiating this and continuing this proposal by delaying on it, I say that I personally would support the motion and hope that the community can resolve this and bring back something different.

02:18:51.267 --> 02:19:00.170
But I'm not willing to go on the information I have today to intercede in this situation and say, I've heard enough.

02:19:00.330 --> 02:19:01.210
I know what's best.

02:19:02.451 --> 02:19:05.032
We're going to, you know, let them go.

02:19:05.272 --> 02:19:06.852
And so that's my view.

02:19:07.112 --> 02:19:08.833
Board Member Williams, you've been waiting to speak.

02:19:09.797 --> 02:19:15.141
I would just say, as I understand it, this has to be acted upon one way or another.

02:19:15.301 --> 02:19:20.405
Even if we delay it, you can't move on to another petition until this petition is settled.

02:19:20.565 --> 02:19:21.066
Well, you can.

02:19:22.127 --> 02:19:28.571
You can consider another petition while there are no time limits on you for taking action on this.

02:19:29.072 --> 02:19:35.376
Certainly, if there was another petition that came in, you could consider both of them at the same time.

02:19:35.437 --> 02:19:36.858
You could, you know, then

02:19:38.038 --> 02:19:44.362
and perhaps prove another petition that came in.

02:19:44.683 --> 02:19:52.267
There's nothing that prevents multiple petitions for kind of the same issue from being before the board at the same time.

02:19:52.287 --> 02:19:56.270
You do not have to kill this for another action to start.

02:19:56.972 --> 02:20:25.818
Okay, but a motion has been made seconded to deny the unification at this point in time, but there appears to be quite a bit of sympathetic sentiment on the part of many board members to have the petitioner come back with a different solution that they would like us to consider, with more pieces put in place, more issues addressed if we were to approve a unification.

02:20:26.399 --> 02:20:32.255
that they've got a new way of approaching it, that we would be sympathetic to them coming back with that.

02:20:33.291 --> 02:20:34.132
Certainly.

02:20:34.552 --> 02:20:52.224
Regardless of whether or not they come back with the districts or the county or anyone comes back with a different petition for unification or other reorganization, it is really not relevant to what it is that you have to do with this proposal.

02:20:52.264 --> 02:20:55.146
You are either going to disapprove this one or you are going to move it forward.

02:20:55.706 --> 02:20:59.509
That is completely independent of what else

02:21:00.049 --> 02:21:03.151
If you disapprove it, then the community can come back with another one.

02:21:03.931 --> 02:21:10.995
Or if conditions change under your regulations, they can ask you to reconsider the existing, the disapproval.

02:21:11.955 --> 02:21:26.483
If you let it go for two, three, four years, or however long it would take to get a new proposal through the county, through the petition process or the resolution process through the county committee, and then through us and back to you, I mean, that's probably a four-year process.

02:21:28.004 --> 02:21:35.230
then it still does not change the fact that you have to at some point in time take action on the proposal currently before you.

02:21:36.952 --> 02:21:37.272
Okay.

02:21:37.352 --> 02:21:38.473
Are we ready to vote?

02:21:39.194 --> 02:21:39.474
Yes.

02:21:39.614 --> 02:21:39.914
Okay.

02:21:39.954 --> 02:21:41.015
Clerk, call the roll then.

02:21:46.140 --> 02:21:46.420
Okay.

02:21:46.600 --> 02:21:47.261
Patricia Rucker.

02:21:48.971 --> 02:21:49.611
Karen Valdez.

02:21:51.352 --> 02:21:52.833
Feliza Ortiz-Licone.

02:21:53.954 --> 02:21:54.394
Sue Burr.

02:21:55.535 --> 02:21:56.275
Eileen Strauss.

02:21:57.596 --> 02:21:58.196
Mike Kirst.

02:21:58.336 --> 02:21:58.657
Yes.

02:21:59.317 --> 02:21:59.917
Ting Sun.

02:22:01.818 --> 02:22:02.519
Trish Williams.

02:22:06.381 --> 02:22:07.162
Nikki Sandoval.

02:22:08.722 --> 02:22:09.263
Jayden Gray.

02:22:10.744 --> 02:22:11.384
Bruce Holliday.

02:22:12.845 --> 02:22:13.305
It passes.

02:22:13.685 --> 02:22:16.207
Okay, the petition passes and then we'll move on then.

02:22:19.461 --> 02:22:20.822
Motion passes, I'm sorry.

02:22:20.862 --> 02:22:22.943
Yes, not the petition, the motion.

02:22:23.683 --> 02:22:25.044
So we need a break.

02:22:25.144 --> 02:22:28.065
So let's come back at 11.25.

02:22:28.646 --> 02:22:40.872
Okay, the board will reconvene and we're ready for item 23, which is a petition for establishment of the preservation, I'm sorry, Preserverence Preparatory School.

02:22:42.112 --> 02:22:44.013
CDE will present.

02:22:45.703 --> 02:22:49.268
to give us an overview and then we'll proceed to a public hearing.

02:23:02.694 --> 02:23:03.094
Is it on now?

02:23:03.934 --> 02:23:04.114
Yes?

02:23:04.614 --> 02:23:04.794
Yes?

02:23:04.954 --> 02:23:05.134
Okay.

02:23:05.414 --> 02:23:05.715
Okay.

02:23:05.735 --> 02:23:06.115
Go ahead.

02:23:06.135 --> 02:23:06.655
Thank you.

02:23:08.755 --> 02:23:09.995
Good morning members of the board.

02:23:10.335 --> 02:23:15.316
My name is Lisa Constancio and I'm the Director of the Charter Schools Division about three weeks now.

02:23:16.236 --> 02:23:19.177
Thank you for the California Department of Education.

02:23:19.857 --> 02:23:32.459
Item 23 is an appeal by Perseverance Preparatory School to establish a new charter school which was denied by the San Jose Unified School District and the Santa Clara County Board of Education.

02:23:34.025 --> 02:23:44.667
Pursuant to statute, petitioners for a charter school that have been denied at the local level may petition the State Board of Education for approval of the charter subject to certain conditions.

02:23:45.868 --> 02:23:53.249
The Perseverance Preparatory School, PPS, submitted an appeal to the State Board on September 28, 2017, and staff has reviewed the documents submitted.

02:23:58.024 --> 02:24:13.751
Based on our review, the California Department of Education proposes to recommend that the State Board hold a public hearing to approve the request to establish PPS with special conditions for a five-year term effective July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2023.

02:24:18.823 --> 02:24:27.305
The CDE recommends the following conditions to be met as outlined and prior to PPS opening for operation in 2018-19.

02:24:28.486 --> 02:24:36.228
By January 30, 2018, provide evidence that the PPS Board has accepted the State Board conditions of authorization.

02:24:37.348 --> 02:24:50.500
By February 15, 2018, the PPS Board will provide the CDE with a revised charter petition containing the necessary changes needed to reflect the State Board as the authorizing entity.

02:24:52.113 --> 02:25:04.984
By May 15, 2018, the PPS Board will provide the CDE with verifiable and substantive evidence that PPS has received the funding anticipated from Silicon Schools Fund.

02:25:06.105 --> 02:25:12.791
By May 15, 2018, the PPS Board will provide the CDE with a fully executed facility lease agreement.

02:25:13.752 --> 02:25:22.923
By June 15, 2018, the PPS Board will provide the CDE with a revised 2018-19 budget with complete narrative and assumptions.

02:25:24.366 --> 02:25:40.235
PPS proposes to serve 128 pupils in grade 5 in 2018-19 and expand by 128 pupils and one grade level per year to serve 512 pupils through grade 8 in 2021-22.

02:25:40.335 --> 02:25:53.202
The CDE finds that the petitioner has a sound educational plan, but did find that the petitioner is not able to successfully implement the intended program due to unrealistic financial plan.

02:25:54.844 --> 02:26:07.551
The CDE did find that this finding can be resolved if PPS is able to present evidence of the receipt of the funding included in the budget from Silicon Schools Fund, which is one of the conditions before the State Board.

02:26:08.851 --> 02:26:15.875
PPS will also provide a revised 2018-19 budget once the facility lease and or rental costs have been determined.

02:26:17.182 --> 02:26:24.286
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools considered the PPS petition for establishment at its December 7, 2017 meeting.

02:26:25.086 --> 02:26:30.729
The ACCS moved staff recommendation to approve the PPS petition for establishment with conditions.

02:26:31.550 --> 02:26:33.151
The motion passed unanimously.

02:26:34.071 --> 02:26:36.553
CDE staff is here to address any of your questions.

02:26:41.896 --> 02:26:42.076
OK.

02:26:47.921 --> 02:26:50.062
Well, I think we ought to open the public hearing.

02:26:50.182 --> 02:26:50.462
Yes.

02:26:51.143 --> 02:26:51.443
OK.

02:26:51.503 --> 02:26:53.664
Well, I'll now open the public hearing.

02:26:54.084 --> 02:26:57.727
Each side has 10 minutes to present the case.

02:26:57.967 --> 02:27:04.070
And so I would allow then to the petitioners for the charter, new charter, the first 10 minutes.

02:27:04.730 --> 02:27:05.591
Please come forward.

02:27:20.080 --> 02:27:23.481
Is it all right if I remove this flash drive and pull up our?

02:27:23.501 --> 02:27:28.503
Oh, actually, it's right here.

02:27:41.587 --> 02:27:44.328
We got it.

02:27:48.558 --> 02:27:50.941
Good morning President Kirst and Trustees of the Board.

02:27:51.401 --> 02:27:57.608
My name is Alexandria Lena Talley and I am the Lead Founder and Proposed Executive Director of Perseverance Preparatory School.

02:27:58.129 --> 02:28:08.600
We are extremely grateful for your time today, for the recommendation for approval from the California Department of Education, as well as the unanimous recommendation for approval from the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools.

02:28:09.181 --> 02:28:23.042
We would like to thank the staff for their time and the careful review of our full petition and are looking forward to sharing Perseverance Prep with you today on behalf of the community and the families that have worked so hard over the past year to bring this school to the children of San Jose.

02:28:25.160 --> 02:28:28.282
I have been living and working in San Jose for the past nine years.

02:28:28.803 --> 02:28:35.227
As a founding fifth grade teacher at Cornerstone Academy, I personally recruited 22 of the 30 students I taught.

02:28:35.807 --> 02:28:44.873
I sat with parents in coffee shops, libraries, and living rooms to create a common vision for their children, the dream of college and the power of education.

02:28:45.854 --> 02:28:53.757
When students reached sixth grade, I was tasked with finding a high-performing middle school to continue the work we had begun and further the academic gains they had made.

02:28:54.597 --> 02:28:58.859
I began to understand how few quality options our parents had to choose from.

02:29:00.519 --> 02:29:09.462
Each of my students applied to at least four different high-performing schools, and of the 30, all selected randomly through lotteries, three got in.

02:29:11.063 --> 02:29:13.704
Parents and students were heartbroken when they received the news,

02:29:14.943 --> 02:29:18.507
They now knew what an excellent education looked like and the power that it possessed.

02:29:19.769 --> 02:29:26.817
I'll never forget the conversation I had with a distraught and tearful mother who asked where her child would go given the lack of options.

02:29:27.850 --> 02:29:34.418
This mother had seen what a rigorous program could do for her son and how it shaped and informed her child's vision of himself.

02:29:35.179 --> 02:29:38.322
He had entered Cornerstone almost two years behind grade level.

02:29:38.683 --> 02:29:43.088
And by the time he was finishing sixth grade, he was testing well above the seventh grade reading level.

02:29:43.768 --> 02:29:47.052
His story, like so many others, is why I became a teacher.

02:29:48.092 --> 02:29:53.756
I brought him and his mother into my classroom to further discuss other options, given the harrowing news.

02:29:54.397 --> 02:30:03.703
The student was quiet throughout the conversation, but at the end he turned to his mother and said, no matter what, I will be able to succeed because I have grit and perseverance.

02:30:05.244 --> 02:30:10.208
It's amazing how children possess such clarity and poise in times of great disappointment.

02:30:10.988 --> 02:30:13.090
And so Perseverance Prep was born.

02:30:15.540 --> 02:30:18.823
The mission stands at the heart of everything we do and what we believe in.

02:30:19.283 --> 02:30:25.648
It remains our North Star as we guide our students and prepare them to be the ethical leaders who will drive positive change in the future.

02:30:26.308 --> 02:30:31.052
While difficult to explain an entire school program in 10 minutes, there are three key takeaways.

02:30:31.712 --> 02:30:36.296
First, Perseverance Prep is a homegrown effort with a high capacity founding team.

02:30:37.237 --> 02:30:44.983
Second, our community stands with us and our school design has been modeled and created in direct response to the conversations we've held with parents.

02:30:46.149 --> 02:30:52.792
Third, there's a deep need for a high-performing middle school in San Jose and proof of parents seeking other options.

02:30:54.213 --> 02:30:56.454
Our founding team is deeply rooted in the community.

02:30:57.014 --> 02:31:08.899
All of the founding board members have lived or worked within San Jose and have a wealth of experience in various fields, including law, finance, facilities, and with a combined experience of over 30 years in education.

02:31:09.800 --> 02:31:14.982
This team has engaged in over 350 conversations with community members, more of,

02:31:16.164 --> 02:31:18.504
more than 250 of which have been with parents.

02:31:19.305 --> 02:31:22.985
Through these conversations, a resounding sentiment rang out.

02:31:24.025 --> 02:31:26.106
I want my child to go to college.

02:31:27.246 --> 02:31:30.567
There are a number of other questions raised centering around these three buckets.

02:31:31.067 --> 02:31:33.007
Would the school prepare my child for college?

02:31:33.487 --> 02:31:37.328
How would my child be served if he was ahead or behind grade level?

02:31:37.768 --> 02:31:39.908
And does the school solely focus on academics?

02:31:40.568 --> 02:31:43.309
Through these conversations, we began to craft our vision.

02:31:45.046 --> 02:31:49.648
Perseverance Prep is a college preparatory middle school serving grades five to eight.

02:31:50.088 --> 02:31:59.833
We seek to ensure our students are firmly set on the path to succeed in a rigorous high school program and will thrive in a ninth grade honors English course when they matriculate from our eighth grade.

02:32:00.533 --> 02:32:05.276
Each of our students will take speech and debate to develop argumentative skills and critical analysis.

02:32:05.996 --> 02:32:14.741
Knowing that we will likely have a large population of English language learner students, we have strategically aligned our speech and debate curriculum to the English language development standards.

02:32:15.481 --> 02:32:30.489
Modeled after the debate course at classical charter schools, a blue ribbon school founded through and supported by building excellence schools, students will participate in structured debates as they will be required to properly create their arguments, refute counterclaims, and prepare for a rebuttal.

02:32:31.349 --> 02:32:35.611
Building this foundation in middle school provides students with a head start they will need for high school.

02:32:36.671 --> 02:32:40.532
Many of our parents had concerns if their students were ahead or behind grade level.

02:32:41.152 --> 02:32:50.356
Being located in the heart of Silicon Valley, we have the opportunity to be a one-to-one school, where each of our students will have access to a Chromebook, and with it, access to personalized learning platforms.

02:32:51.636 --> 02:32:58.339
to grow every student every day in a way that honors and supports their challenges and maximizes their growth.

02:32:58.899 --> 02:33:09.083
We allocate and prioritize time within our daily schedules to have students work on individual academic goals and will leverage a multitude of personalized learning platforms to reach these goals.

02:33:10.267 --> 02:33:17.075
During our reading power hour and math power hour, we strategically use small group instruction to target students' specific skill gaps.

02:33:17.655 --> 02:33:24.223
Data aggregated from these personalized learning programs allow teachers to drive instruction based solely on the needs of their students.

02:33:24.763 --> 02:33:29.669
This occurs during our daily tutoring block, which allows teachers to remediate and give support where necessary.

02:33:31.018 --> 02:33:35.561
While academics is our main focus, the content of our students' character is equally important.

02:33:36.001 --> 02:33:44.047
We have integrated a service learning curriculum throughout our school, both in the culture of the school as well as direct instruction during the weekly leadership class.

02:33:44.867 --> 02:33:53.473
Students work on a community betterment project to identify challenges within the community, create an actionable solution, and then work with the community to carry them out to fruition.

02:33:54.174 --> 02:33:59.617
We will teach our students that by finding the power and potential of their voice, they may elevate others.

02:34:00.578 --> 02:34:02.579
Perseverance Prep is different in many ways.

02:34:03.580 --> 02:34:12.584
We seek to partner with parents and create an open line of communication, beginning with home visits, followed by weekly progress reports and cafecitos with the executive director.

02:34:13.145 --> 02:34:18.508
By beginning the relationship early on and sustaining it throughout the year, the school will have a family feel.

02:34:19.068 --> 02:34:26.272
We have held over 20 information sessions, three literacy nights, and even a fun summer barbecue to engage and welcome the families.

02:34:26.972 --> 02:34:40.263
Our parents have been an integral part of the formation of not only the mission of Perseverance Prep, but its continued presence in the community, as evidenced by over 142 applications for the 128 seats for our inaugural class.

02:34:40.884 --> 02:34:47.669
This many parents interested in a school that has yet to be approved is a testament to the belief in the specific mission and model.

02:34:48.510 --> 02:34:56.894
As seen as a common thread throughout our presentation, student leadership is an integral part of the school culture, instruction, and everyday life at Perseverance Prep.

02:34:57.474 --> 02:35:02.657
We have personalized learning and individual supports for our students to target the instruction to their exact needs.

02:35:03.237 --> 02:35:14.362
To ensure everyone learns every day, we also provide robust professional development for our teachers through early release days and professional development for three hours, as well as weekly observations and coaching cycles.

02:35:16.530 --> 02:35:19.933
there is a need to speak about the performance of students within San Jose.

02:35:20.814 --> 02:35:41.114
While the overall scores for the SBAC show about 50% of students reaching proficiency in reading, and a little less than 50% reaching proficiency in math, when the data is disaggregated, its scores drop drastically, with fewer than a third of socioeconomically disadvantaged students able to score proficient on the SBAC, and fewer than 20% of Latino students able to perform math proficiently.

02:35:43.080 --> 02:35:45.021
There is a clear need in San Jose.

02:35:45.422 --> 02:35:48.904
Parents want this option, and parents have fought for this option.

02:35:49.525 --> 02:35:54.629
Currently, almost 700 students are on wait lists for charters that serve grades five through eight.

02:35:55.249 --> 02:35:56.891
Parents want more options.

02:35:57.371 --> 02:35:58.312
Parents want choice.

02:35:58.932 --> 02:36:00.473
Not only parents, but students.

02:36:04.597 --> 02:36:07.379
Fortunately, she had to be in school today, so we took a video of her.

02:36:22.756 --> 02:36:23.456
which may not work.

02:36:30.800 --> 02:36:31.260
That's okay.

02:36:31.861 --> 02:36:33.361
We'll show perseverance.

02:36:34.122 --> 02:36:40.025
So she testified at the county board hearing.

02:36:44.827 --> 02:36:46.128
Can the tech guys help with this?

02:37:00.285 --> 02:37:01.610
We could try closed captioning.

02:37:01.630 --> 02:37:01.690
Yes.

02:37:33.877 --> 02:37:34.397
Is there audio?

02:37:38.718 --> 02:37:38.838
Hmm.

02:37:40.879 --> 02:37:41.899
It's playing, but we don't hear it.

02:37:44.240 --> 02:37:44.940
No, is that online?

02:37:45.760 --> 02:37:46.021
Mm-hmm.

02:37:46.501 --> 02:37:46.821
OK.

02:37:49.121 --> 02:37:49.342
Hmm.

02:37:52.843 --> 02:37:53.423
Should be hearing it.

02:37:57.044 --> 02:37:57.684
Turn it all the way up.

02:38:04.329 --> 02:38:07.681
Might need to restart maybe, but it's just a browser, so I don't know why.

02:38:07.721 --> 02:38:08.022
It's OK.

02:38:08.082 --> 02:38:08.423
No problem.

02:38:08.444 --> 02:38:09.367
I appreciate your help.

02:38:09.387 --> 02:38:10.250
Yeah, it should be working.

02:38:15.990 --> 02:38:17.731
True to form, it's all right.

02:38:17.871 --> 02:38:19.371
So this was, it's okay.

02:38:19.491 --> 02:38:25.713
It was a video of a student who's very excited and enthusiastic about attending Perseverance Prep.

02:38:26.374 --> 02:38:32.336
We would like, once again, to thank the CDE staff and the ACCS for their diligence and the positive recommendation for approval.

02:38:32.876 --> 02:38:38.398
While we gave a detailed response agreeing to the stipulations, we are happy to answer any and all questions you may have.

02:38:39.018 --> 02:38:39.258
Thank you.

02:39:10.998 --> 02:39:13.583
Good morning, my name is Christelle Johnson.

02:39:13.744 --> 02:39:17.130
I'm the Director for Charter Schools for Santa Clara County Office of Education.

02:39:17.151 --> 02:39:21.399
I'd like to provide you with a brief historical account of our decision-making process.

02:39:22.614 --> 02:39:41.682
On June 30th, 2017, the Charter Schools Department of Santa Clara County Office of Education received a petition for a District Appeal Charter School for Perseverance Preparatory School Team to establish and operate a public charter middle school for grades five through eight for one year for planning plus an additional five years serving students through June 2023.

02:39:43.929 --> 02:39:51.279
SCCOE complied with all applicable timeline requirements established by California Ed Code Section 47605B.

02:39:51.840 --> 02:39:55.425
A public hearing was held on June 19th, excuse me, July 19th, 2017.

02:39:57.538 --> 02:40:06.445
SCCOE Charter Schools Department staff analyzed the petition following California Ed Code and the board's guidelines regarding consideration of district appeal charters.

02:40:07.126 --> 02:40:13.751
The analysis was based on review of the petition supported by information gathered during the capacity interview, which was held on July 25, 2017.

02:40:14.932 --> 02:40:26.562
SCCOE staff found that the petition met requirements for required signatures and affirmations, although there were significant questions regarding mandatory school uniforms and fees.

02:40:27.580 --> 02:40:33.648
Additionally, the staff also concluded after careful analysis that the petition presented an unsound educational program.

02:40:34.642 --> 02:41:03.042
that the petitioners were demonstratively unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition, and that the petition does not include a reasonably comprehensive descriptors of the number of required charter elements, including, but not limited to, an unclear rotational model of instruction, undefined and unsound educational services practices for addressing English language learners and special education students, an overall lack of coherence between the deliveries

02:41:06.397 --> 02:41:27.406
of core areas while integrating multiple or other instructional elements, the lack of metrics for target student performance and growth, a coherent system of analysis of, excuse me, to analyze and validate instructional effectiveness, deficiencies in employee qualifications, health and safety, admission requirements, and student discipline, including student suspension and expulsion.

02:41:28.106 --> 02:41:37.927
There are also significant concerns in the areas of fiscal budget analysis and the petitioner's ability to attain and sustain enrollment, which is crucial for fiscal solemnity.

02:41:39.042 --> 02:41:43.566
SECBOE held a decision hearing on Perseverance on August 16, 2017.

02:41:45.067 --> 02:42:00.119
Although the staff found that the petition offered a program that might benefit students in a middle school educational system, due to the numerous deficiencies and issues as aforementioned, the SECOE Charter Schools Department staff made a recommendation of denial of the Perseverance Preparatory School petition.

02:42:00.859 --> 02:42:04.227
The board reviewed and considered all information and voted as follows.

02:42:04.869 --> 02:42:09.360
Four denials, two approvals, one trustee was absent during the decision-making process.

02:42:14.912 --> 02:42:17.093
Good morning President Kirsten, members of the board.

02:42:17.133 --> 02:42:22.455
My name is Nancy Alboran and I have the privilege to lead the San Jose Unified School District.

02:42:22.575 --> 02:42:28.397
It is the most diverse and largest district in the county and I'm just really proud to do the work there.

02:42:28.497 --> 02:42:32.199
This morning we are going to very quickly give you a brief

02:42:33.799 --> 02:42:40.562
set of examples of why we believe this petition is deficient, and we also want to offer a path for moving forward.

02:42:40.942 --> 02:42:44.843
So in San Jose Unified, we are incredibly committed to quality and equity.

02:42:45.143 --> 02:42:49.565
It's something that we have been doing for the last 25 years.

02:42:49.705 --> 02:42:55.727
We were the first district to go bankrupt, but we were also one of the first districts to pass an equity policy in the country.

02:42:56.167 --> 02:43:01.690
We have a board that is committed to high quality options for all families and we work diligently to do that.

02:43:01.991 --> 02:43:16.259
We built a robust evaluation system because 80% of our funds go to people and we know having the best and the brightest are going to deliver the outcomes we're looking for for students, particularly the students that have been underserved, not just in our public system but across the country.

02:43:16.659 --> 02:43:30.554
And so with an accountability system for our employees, both leaders and teachers, and looking at charter operators that have high quality options, we are open to charter schools in our system that are of quality.

02:43:32.415 --> 02:43:35.016
Good morning, I'm Steve McMahon, Deputy Superintendent for the School District.

02:43:35.056 --> 02:43:37.257
We definitely wanna walk through some of the context.

02:43:38.098 --> 02:43:43.440
Santa Clara County has 31 school districts, and when you include the County Office of Education, that's 32 LEAs.

02:43:44.060 --> 02:43:47.582
Across those 32 LEAs, 84 charter schools have been approved.

02:43:48.182 --> 02:43:52.624
So our county is one of the leaders in honoring the intent of the 1992 Charter Schools Act.

02:43:53.544 --> 02:43:55.345
Charters have been very welcome in our community.

02:43:55.625 --> 02:44:00.848
We have a diverse portfolio of schools throughout Santa Clara County, as evidenced by the 84 approvals.

02:44:01.688 --> 02:44:04.089
A subset of Santa Clara County is the city of San Jose.

02:44:04.889 --> 02:44:09.670
Often, when you hear a comment about San Jose schools, it's intertwined with San Jose Unified.

02:44:09.690 --> 02:44:10.650
They're not the same thing.

02:44:11.070 --> 02:44:15.652
We just happen to be the only of the 19 school districts in the city with San Jose in its title.

02:44:16.232 --> 02:44:17.672
But there are 18 other school districts.

02:44:17.712 --> 02:44:19.413
The petitioner mentioned Cornerstone.

02:44:19.693 --> 02:44:20.613
It's not in our district.

02:44:21.113 --> 02:44:26.894
It's very important when you consider the facts that you differentiate between the city of San Jose and San Jose Unified School District.

02:44:26.914 --> 02:44:28.815
We are one of only 19 school districts.

02:44:29.415 --> 02:44:29.916
in the city.

02:44:30.336 --> 02:44:33.480
Across those 19 LEAs, 65 charters have been approved.

02:44:34.161 --> 02:44:37.044
We're this little sliver compared to that prior big county map.

02:44:37.504 --> 02:44:41.108
There are 10 charter schools currently open in the Santa's Unified School District boundaries.

02:44:41.769 --> 02:44:43.711
Our board initially approved five of them.

02:44:44.412 --> 02:44:50.374
Two of them were approved on appeal at the county level and three went directly to the county as countywide benefits.

02:44:50.674 --> 02:44:52.435
So there are already 10 charter schools open.

02:44:52.995 --> 02:44:54.515
The petitioner mentioned demand.

02:44:55.476 --> 02:44:59.437
We want to make sure we're very clear on differentiating between San Jose and San Jose Unified.

02:45:00.407 --> 02:45:04.448
The petitioner in the petition on pages 12 and 13 of the petition has a chart of wait lists.

02:45:05.228 --> 02:45:10.349
It neglects to show you the wait lists of the existing charter middle schools in our boundaries because they don't have them.

02:45:10.849 --> 02:45:13.430
And we called Sunrise yesterday, they do not have a wait list.

02:45:13.470 --> 02:45:15.370
They are accepting students in all grade levels.

02:45:15.910 --> 02:45:24.552
Downtown College Prep Middle School, Ace Middle School, Sunrise Middle School, all charter middle schools, all in San Jose, all serving the same demographics.

02:45:25.052 --> 02:45:26.253
the petitioner seeks to serve.

02:45:27.113 --> 02:45:29.734
We are concerned, like the county offices, about demand.

02:45:30.274 --> 02:45:37.177
Are there a sufficient number of students to add a fourth charter middle school in the same geographic area, which is a small subset of the city of San Jose?

02:45:37.777 --> 02:45:40.358
Perseverance did not qualify for Prop 39 facilities.

02:45:40.778 --> 02:45:43.259
They did not have enough in-district students to be eligible.

02:45:43.639 --> 02:45:46.220
If you look at their petition, there are no family signatures.

02:45:46.580 --> 02:45:47.661
They submitted with teachers.

02:45:48.121 --> 02:45:52.723
We've wondered from the beginning how many students there are within the San Jose Unified boundary

02:45:53.203 --> 02:46:05.137
to substantiate the demand for this school, which we think is incredibly important because the CDE review found that the petition was deficient on 20% of the legal requirements, most notably the budget.

02:46:06.079 --> 02:46:11.025
The CDE says the school cannot implement its program with the budget that was presented.

02:46:11.765 --> 02:46:14.447
I've been doing budgets for school districts for a long time as a CBO.

02:46:14.928 --> 02:46:26.257
If revenue is fixed and you have a substantial increase in facility costs, which the CDE says is going to happen, which is why they put the condition for a new budget, you're going to have to do something else on the expense side.

02:46:26.818 --> 02:46:32.302
Fixed revenue, more for facilities, questionable enrollment demands, you have to cut expenses somewhere else.

02:46:32.723 --> 02:46:36.105
We met with the petitioners last week regarding facilities since they're not eligible for Prop 39.

02:46:37.306 --> 02:46:41.249
Sunrise Middle School, Ace Middle School have existing leases with us as charter schools.

02:46:41.669 --> 02:46:43.190
We use the exact same template.

02:46:43.890 --> 02:46:49.073
Perseverance is underestimated by at least 72% the cost of facilities in San Jose.

02:46:49.453 --> 02:46:51.454
We are in Silicon Valley, you know how expensive it is.

02:46:51.815 --> 02:46:53.776
Facilities are incredibly expensive in our area.

02:46:53.796 --> 02:46:56.998
$155,000 is a generous estimate for the minimum cost for 15,000 square feet in San Jose Unified.

02:47:01.320 --> 02:47:06.183
We think that presents a substantial problem to the state board and the legal process for charters.

02:47:07.104 --> 02:47:11.467
If revenues fixed and expenses go out for some facilities, the petition has to change.

02:47:12.387 --> 02:47:21.093
Increased class size, reduced support staff, something on the expense side must be adjusted to satisfy the state's requirement of a revised budget.

02:47:21.653 --> 02:47:27.537
We feel that that means the petition is going to be a different petition, and you have a process to remedy that.

02:47:28.117 --> 02:47:29.878
The petitioner should make the corrections,

02:47:30.979 --> 02:47:32.120
return it to the local level.

02:47:32.901 --> 02:47:39.466
We actually are thinking Perseverance is maybe one of the best positioned charters in the entire state.

02:47:40.247 --> 02:47:43.730
It has feedback from the district, it has feedback from the county, it has feedback from the CDE.

02:47:44.310 --> 02:47:49.814
Take the feedback, resubmit at the local level, the San Jose Unified is going to be approving it.

02:47:50.615 --> 02:47:54.660
Because all of the deficiencies, if they're corrected, we won't have the legal ground to deny it again.

02:47:55.121 --> 02:48:05.173
We are very concerned, though, that if the state board is putting conditions on a petition and forcing changes to it, that does not align to the process that the legislature intended.

02:48:05.594 --> 02:48:07.556
Schools are supposed to come from the local communities.

02:48:07.616 --> 02:48:08.717
It's local charter demand.

02:48:09.378 --> 02:48:13.901
The teachers that signed this petition signed for a certain class size, certain support staff, certain budget.

02:48:14.441 --> 02:48:21.346
Changing that budget without reengaging them on that budget, we don't think honors the intent of the Legislative Act of 1992.

02:48:21.926 --> 02:48:23.828
So, we wanted to recommend a path forward.

02:48:23.868 --> 02:48:32.894
We do think the best path forward is to take all of this feedback from the local level, the district level, and the CDE, incorporate it into a revised petition, and resubmit that petition.

02:48:34.110 --> 02:48:35.331
We thank you very much for the time.

02:48:35.451 --> 02:48:36.751
Santa's Unified staff is here.

02:48:36.791 --> 02:48:42.435
We encourage you to be curious, ask us lots of questions, and we think it is essential to seek information.

02:48:43.735 --> 02:48:45.736
Evidence is critical in discussions like this.

02:48:46.157 --> 02:48:54.101
The wait lists, which schools are in Santa's Unified, which schools are in Santa Clara County, evidence and factual information is essential to the work you do.

02:48:54.481 --> 02:49:01.305
We have our enrollment center team here, our tech team, bilingual, all of our departments are represented, and we're happy to answer any questions you may have today.

02:49:01.545 --> 02:49:02.586
And we look forward to discussion.

02:49:02.686 --> 02:49:02.946
Thank you.

02:49:06.272 --> 02:49:16.559
Okay, that concludes the opening statements and our process is to take public comment and then you get all the input that we can.

02:49:16.759 --> 02:49:22.243
And so the staff will call the roll and on the public comment.

02:49:28.444 --> 02:49:30.506
Would the following speakers please line up?

02:49:30.826 --> 02:49:57.226
Janelle Rooley, Claudia Rossi, Gemma Ables, Joanna Latz, Melissa Urbach, Grace Ma, Joseph DeSalvo, Claire Crawford, Peter Ortiz, Brian Greenberg, Brett Bymaster, Stephanie Palmieri, Maria Marcello, Juan Torres, Janet Duran, Araceli Serrano, and I'll call additional names later.

02:50:03.663 --> 02:50:05.205
Good morning, state board members.

02:50:05.265 --> 02:50:06.226
My name is Janelle Rooley.

02:50:06.646 --> 02:50:11.211
I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Young, Middy, and Core here in strong support of Perseverance.

02:50:12.292 --> 02:50:18.798
I think I just heard San Jose Unified School District saying that the district would approve this charter if the petitioners were to go back.

02:50:19.939 --> 02:50:34.276
Have to say the other thing that I heard this morning was a evidence of a broken relationship or broken trust in a community I think that's what we have here It's frankly, it's very difficult for perseverance to believe that they would get a fair shake at the district This is the same district that

02:50:35.017 --> 02:50:48.750
First of all, forced them to wait 49 days for a public hearing, 62 days for action, required a second set of petition signatures, and actually told the petitioners they had to get signatures from 100% of the meaningfully interested teachers when the law clearly says 50%.

02:50:51.212 --> 02:50:59.417
In addition to that, the district stated at the advisory commission meeting that they proudly stated that they do not work with petitioners in the process.

02:50:59.817 --> 02:51:03.599
So I hope what you're going to do today is vote on this petition that's before you.

02:51:03.919 --> 02:51:05.540
The city has recommended approval.

02:51:06.580 --> 02:51:09.082
The ACCS has supported it, and we look for your support.

02:51:09.102 --> 02:51:09.402
Thank you.

02:51:16.411 --> 02:51:17.392
Good morning trustees.

02:51:17.432 --> 02:51:18.792
My name is Claudia Rossi.

02:51:18.972 --> 02:51:21.674
I serve on the Santa Clara County Board of Education.

02:51:22.174 --> 02:51:24.576
Thank you for this opportunity and for all you do.

02:51:24.596 --> 02:51:28.798
I think I have a little idea of what you go through as you attempt to serve community.

02:51:28.818 --> 02:51:37.263
I am here as an adult that arrived in California when I was seven years old.

02:51:37.543 --> 02:51:38.924
I was an English learner and

02:51:39.344 --> 02:51:46.367
And so I understand the importance of a strong curriculum that supports English language development.

02:51:46.407 --> 02:51:51.669
So I come to examination of this petition in particular with that lens.

02:51:52.109 --> 02:51:55.170
And I want to read to you something that I found very concerning.

02:51:56.551 --> 02:52:04.194
What staff found is that the perseverance plan would only offer a bare bones curriculum to its students.

02:52:04.674 --> 02:52:08.976
and would also make it difficult to maintain small group instructional settings.

02:52:09.537 --> 02:52:15.360
Further, it found that there was insufficient time for ELD instruction.

02:52:15.960 --> 02:52:21.803
And what that means is significant given that they organized community members.

02:52:22.624 --> 02:52:27.726
I urge you to consider the suggestion made by San Jose Unified.

02:52:27.746 --> 02:52:30.048
I think it would be best to serve our families.

02:52:30.148 --> 02:52:30.548
Thank you.

02:52:36.550 --> 02:52:38.131
Hello, my name is Grace Ma.

02:52:38.171 --> 02:52:40.911
I'm on the Santa Clara County Board of Education.

02:52:40.991 --> 02:52:42.592
I've been on the board for 10 years.

02:52:43.172 --> 02:52:47.834
I'm also a former engineer, Silicon Valley engineer, recovering as I say.

02:52:47.854 --> 02:52:51.755
And I'd like to present some data, which I believe has been passed out to everybody.

02:52:52.235 --> 02:52:56.077
It includes on the first page a map of the San Jose downtown schools.

02:52:56.717 --> 02:52:59.758
And I've marked the elementary schools, middle school, and high school there.

02:53:00.638 --> 02:53:09.421
The following three pages are data from the CDE website with the five by five placement performance indicators.

02:53:09.981 --> 02:53:18.804
The first page on page two shows that all six schools which are in the downtown area are in the orange, red, and yellow areas.

02:53:20.004 --> 02:53:29.907
San Jose has a number of schools all in the blue and green, I won't say that, they don't, but the schools in the downtown area to be served are all in yellow, orange, and red.

02:53:30.587 --> 02:53:32.008
And that's in English language.

02:53:32.528 --> 02:53:34.349
The next chart is on mathematics.

02:53:34.629 --> 02:53:40.471
Likewise, the six schools are also in the red or yellow section.

02:53:41.132 --> 02:53:45.534
And the last page is English learner progress.

02:53:45.914 --> 02:53:46.254
Thank you.

02:53:52.830 --> 02:53:59.599
President Kirst, Superintendent Torlakson, members of the State Board of Education, thank you for your public service.

02:53:59.940 --> 02:54:01.462
My name is Joseph DeSalvo.

02:54:01.782 --> 02:54:04.206
I'm a trustee on the Santa Clara County Board of Education.

02:54:05.863 --> 02:54:10.747
As a trustee on that board, I humbly request you to approve Perseverance Prep.

02:54:11.527 --> 02:54:19.533
As a former middle school principal in San Jose and Santa Clara County, I know that leadership is a critical component of an effective school.

02:54:20.373 --> 02:54:30.780
Perseverance has an extraordinary leader, as you just saw, that has led the work to build its vision, seek support, secure funding, and write an exemplary petition.

02:54:31.861 --> 02:54:39.083
In addition, strong parent and city support is essential for success and Perseverance has successfully earned that support.

02:54:40.584 --> 02:54:57.508
Perseverance will add essential and excellent middle school experiences to our city's portfolio of schools with developmental, social, emotional, curricular, and instructional best practices that will be scalable to all middle schools within the city.

02:54:58.249 --> 02:54:59.209
Thank you for your support.

02:55:06.530 --> 02:55:11.419
Good morning, my name is Johanna Latz, I'm a special education teacher in San Jose Unified School District.

02:55:13.302 --> 02:55:18.131
I feel that the school plan and the budget for promise, perseverance indicate that the school

02:55:19.295 --> 02:55:22.758
Plans only offer minimal services to students with special needs.

02:55:23.018 --> 02:55:33.448
It indicates that the schools will either fail to meet the budget or practice discriminatory enrollment practices towards students with moderate and severe learning disabilities.

02:55:33.868 --> 02:55:38.793
I didn't see anything in the plan that talked about students with IEPs nor students with 504s.

02:55:39.233 --> 02:55:43.577
Students with 504s need accommodations in the curriculum.

02:55:44.137 --> 02:55:46.338
that provide for a medical disability.

02:55:46.738 --> 02:55:55.360
Students with IEPs need individual support services including speech and language services, adaptive PE, occupational therapy.

02:55:55.740 --> 02:55:58.020
It could be vision and hearing disabilities.

02:55:58.380 --> 02:56:05.082
There's nothing in the plan that addresses, that explains how perseverance will help students with those needs.

02:56:05.422 --> 02:56:05.702
Thank you.

02:56:11.636 --> 02:56:13.098
Hello, I'm Melissa Urban.

02:56:13.679 --> 02:56:19.306
I'm an ELD teacher and resident and voter inside San Jose Unified.

02:56:20.527 --> 02:56:27.917
My concern with this proposal is the ELD services that they're proposing in a mainstream speech and debate class.

02:56:28.377 --> 02:56:36.460
We know that state and national guidelines say that best practices required a dedicated ELD instructional time.

02:56:36.880 --> 02:56:47.684
Two-thirds of the students in our community are ELL, and this program just does not adequately serve our ELL students, and so I urge you to reject this.

02:56:48.004 --> 02:56:48.304
Thank you.

02:56:51.886 --> 02:56:52.346
Good morning.

02:56:52.766 --> 02:56:53.927
My name is Brian Greenberg.

02:56:53.947 --> 02:56:56.327
I am the CEO of the Silicon Schools Fund.

02:56:57.307 --> 02:57:02.209
Our foundation works with the most innovative and best schools in Northern California.

02:57:02.689 --> 02:57:11.331
In the past five years, we've made grants in the tens of millions of dollars to support now just about 40 schools that are district, charter, and independent schools.

02:57:12.293 --> 02:57:14.616
In short, our expertise is quality.

02:57:14.936 --> 02:57:16.358
That is our job from day one.

02:57:17.159 --> 02:57:20.223
We've spent more than a year now with this Perseverance prep team.

02:57:20.723 --> 02:57:27.331
And what you heard from other county board members about the quality of the founder and the team, we also are staking our reputation on.

02:57:28.614 --> 02:57:38.640
It is because of this that we have now given and deployed $250,000 of support to Perseverance already, and we have plans to distribute another $550,000 of support.

02:57:39.341 --> 02:57:47.606
We do not do this lightly, and we do this because we have such a strong belief and faith that this school will execute as the rest of our portfolio has done.

02:57:48.346 --> 02:57:52.128
Our grantees score at the top quartile of the state of California.

02:57:52.548 --> 02:57:56.550
These are exceptional schools in which we're honored to hopefully have perseverance be a part.

02:57:57.130 --> 02:57:59.712
This is the kind of school the San Jose parents want and deserve.

02:58:00.192 --> 02:58:00.472
Thank you.

02:58:04.079 --> 02:58:05.319
My name is Brett Bymaster.

02:58:05.339 --> 02:58:07.040
I'm a pastor in the San Jose area.

02:58:07.080 --> 02:58:11.101
I spend my life working with low-income kids in the downtown community.

02:58:12.362 --> 02:58:13.582
I want to make an illustration.

02:58:13.642 --> 02:58:22.185
I want you to imagine that there are 300 or 400 students walking onto a tarmac, and there are two planes parked on that tarmac.

02:58:23.046 --> 02:58:29.068
One of those planes is piloted by a pilot who has 15 years of experience and is licensed and credentialed to fly that airplane.

02:58:29.608 --> 02:58:37.857
The other airplane is piloted by a pilot who got his pilot's license a year and a half ago and is not licensed to fly that airplane.

02:58:37.877 --> 02:58:40.259
I want to ask, which one would you put the 300 students on?

02:58:41.997 --> 02:58:47.778
I'd like to make an argument that running a school is just as complicated, if not more so, than flying an airplane.

02:58:49.038 --> 02:58:49.518
I'm sure that Ms.

02:58:49.558 --> 02:58:56.399
Lena Talley is a great educator, but she received, according to the California Department of Education, she received a clear credential in July of 2016.

02:58:56.720 --> 02:58:58.760
She is not credentialed as an administrator.

02:58:58.860 --> 02:59:10.242
According to the County Board of Education, the requirements for the executive director appear specifically designated to fit the current executive director, which may preclude any other person from filling this role in the future.

02:59:10.582 --> 02:59:11.222
Leadership matters.

02:59:15.427 --> 02:59:17.968
Good morning, my name is Stephanie Palmieri Farias.

02:59:18.288 --> 02:59:21.350
I am a principal in a downtown school in San Jose Unified.

02:59:21.370 --> 02:59:23.831
I'm also a parent in the district for 21 years.

02:59:24.851 --> 02:59:31.334
The state found that perseverance did not have a sound description of suspension and expulsion policies and procedures.

02:59:31.875 --> 02:59:38.578
My school has welcomed many students who have been expelled and basically kicked out of other schools for behavior issues.

02:59:38.978 --> 02:59:42.580
We have supported those students and families when other charter schools did not.

02:59:43.360 --> 02:59:51.425
All charter schools should have clear, transparent, legally compliant suspension and expulsion procedures, or we see the effects on it for everyone.

02:59:51.986 --> 02:59:56.229
I'd also like to say that I have a lot of parents here who are going to need translation.

02:59:56.669 --> 03:00:06.816
So we have our parent liaison who could do that translation, but I hope they're given two minutes so that they can give one minute in Spanish and that we can have the one minute of translation if that is OK.

03:00:07.376 --> 03:00:07.976
That's OK.

03:00:08.417 --> 03:00:08.817
That's OK.

03:00:09.217 --> 03:00:09.477
All right.

03:00:09.577 --> 03:00:10.298
Thank you very much.

03:00:17.238 --> 03:00:18.759
Good morning, my name is Maria Marcelo.

03:00:19.280 --> 03:00:21.782
I am a parent of student for more than 17 years now.

03:00:21.802 --> 03:00:24.103
I am a president for United Mothers in the community of Washington.

03:00:44.795 --> 03:00:49.799
To me, it's very important that if you guys are going to open new schools, to make sure that these schools are fully qualified.

03:00:56.243 --> 03:00:58.745
First of all, that the students are the first priority.

03:01:02.868 --> 03:01:03.568
With the community.

03:01:07.591 --> 03:01:11.294
And also with the academic achievements as well.

03:01:12.932 --> 03:01:17.115
I also want to comment that we're going to leave before the next topic, next school, Promise.

03:01:17.135 --> 03:01:22.199
Personally, I don't believe that this school is capable of helping our kids in our community.

03:01:43.678 --> 03:01:49.520
We need schools that are on top of everything academically.

03:01:49.540 --> 03:01:56.742
And if they are not capable, why would we waste money on opening new schools when we can fix the ones that are already established?

03:02:05.498 --> 03:02:11.079
She believes that working with the schools that are already established and investing more money will be more effective in opening new schools.

03:02:11.099 --> 03:02:11.159
OK.

03:02:11.179 --> 03:02:11.259
Come.

03:02:35.540 --> 03:02:35.980
Good morning.

03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:37.300
My name is Juan Torres.

03:02:37.380 --> 03:02:40.221
I'm also a parent of the San Jose Unified School District.

03:02:40.301 --> 03:02:43.062
I come here to share my opinion on the opening of the school, Perseverance.

03:03:02.885 --> 03:03:10.933
As this have been denied twice for our county and San Jose School District, I believe that it's already enough.

03:03:12.054 --> 03:03:13.195
For example, not having plans for ELD.

03:03:13.235 --> 03:03:14.556
The lack of experience from the leadership.

03:03:25.168 --> 03:03:26.229
Planes deportivos.

03:03:27.330 --> 03:03:28.250
PE programs.

03:03:28.811 --> 03:03:32.733
Apoyo a estudiantes que no reúnan sus estándares educativos.

03:03:33.134 --> 03:03:35.936
Support for students who don't meet the standards.

03:03:36.516 --> 03:03:40.679
Y carecer de firmas de la comunidad teniendo necesidad de estas escuelas.

03:03:41.299 --> 03:03:42.920
And the lack of interest from our community.

03:03:43.201 --> 03:03:43.881
No signatures.

03:03:44.602 --> 03:03:48.564
Con respecto a la relación de Promise.

03:03:49.325 --> 03:03:53.668
Esta solicitud tiene faltas de apoyo para estudiantes aprendiendo el idioma inglés.

03:03:54.545 --> 03:04:02.950
For Promise, I believe this school has the lack of plans to support students who speak other language.

03:04:03.590 --> 03:04:06.131
They don't mention plans for kids who have a lack of, or disabilities learning.

03:04:06.151 --> 03:04:07.012
They lack sports plans, or PE.

03:04:23.365 --> 03:04:27.486
En la comunidad hay escuelas como por ejemplo Rocketship.

03:04:28.506 --> 03:04:30.727
In our community there are schools, for example, Rocketship.

03:04:31.147 --> 03:04:33.167
Donde los niños hacen deportes sentados.

03:04:33.987 --> 03:04:35.808
With the kids do sports sitting down.

03:04:36.448 --> 03:04:38.408
Por no tener las instalaciones adecuadas.

03:04:38.768 --> 03:04:40.429
For the lack of facilities.

03:04:41.149 --> 03:04:46.050
Dicha escuela está ubicada a dos bloques de nuestra escuela, Washington Elementary School.

03:04:47.370 --> 03:04:50.411
This school is located two blocks away from Washington Elementary School.

03:04:50.991 --> 03:04:51.271
Thank you.

03:04:53.519 --> 03:04:57.363
I would like to ask the next group of speakers to please line up.

03:04:58.744 --> 03:05:09.214
Silvia Valderrinos, Victoria Cuenca, Noe Guzman, Monica Vasquez, Vera Sloan, Robin High, Tim

03:05:10.839 --> 03:05:25.404
Terang, Chad Italy, Marissa Alonso, Vitu, Andrea Sosuna, Vanessa Luciano, Nina Goswami, Eric Premack, and Ken Bird.

03:05:33.347 --> 03:05:34.828
Good evening, my name is Jeanette Duran.

03:05:39.167 --> 03:05:41.669
I am also a parent of the San Jose Unified School District.

03:05:45.271 --> 03:05:53.517
I have two children in the elementary school Washington and one on the Sacred Heart.

03:05:56.098 --> 03:05:57.780
My point of view on perseverance prep

03:06:09.672 --> 03:06:14.072
Should meet the requirements that the state has required already previously.

03:06:16.833 --> 03:06:17.153
Thank you.

03:06:26.075 --> 03:06:30.095
Good morning my name is Silvia Valdovinos.

03:06:30.375 --> 03:06:33.896
I am also a parent of the San Jose Unified School District.

03:06:35.365 --> 03:06:35.985
Okay.

03:06:36.866 --> 03:06:38.787
La Preparatoria Perseveranza.

03:06:39.748 --> 03:06:40.768
Siga.

03:06:41.529 --> 03:06:48.112
Veo que no tiene clases para ayudar a las personas que vienen de México que apenas van empezando el inglés.

03:06:49.573 --> 03:06:55.357
I see that the school perseverance lacks on ELD classes for students who are learning English.

03:06:56.998 --> 03:07:02.661
¿No le brindan el apoyo a las personas, niños que necesitan también ayuda de bajo nivel?

03:07:03.666 --> 03:07:08.147
They don't show any help for students who are or have low level.

03:07:09.707 --> 03:07:13.648
I see that they have a bit of experience.

03:07:13.869 --> 03:07:19.470
They lack on experience.

03:07:32.810 --> 03:07:39.493
Tengo amigas donde tienen niños que tienen problemas especiales y andan buscando escuelas.

03:07:40.414 --> 03:07:43.235
I have friends that have children with disabilities.

03:07:43.875 --> 03:07:48.558
Y donde no los agarran en algunas escuelas porque no tienen el apoyo para sus hijos.

03:07:49.058 --> 03:07:52.600
Where these schools have not welcomed their kids because of their disabilities.

03:07:53.020 --> 03:08:01.304
Y ya que quieren hacer alguna escuela nueva que tenga todo para nuestros hijos, para los estudiantes, para que ellos salgan adelante.

03:08:01.877 --> 03:08:07.440
If they're gonna open a new school, we would like these schools to be able to receive every single one of them.

03:08:07.860 --> 03:08:08.181
Thank you.

03:08:15.645 --> 03:08:17.346
Good morning, my name is Araceli Serrano.

03:08:23.289 --> 03:08:25.991
I am here representing the San Jose Unified School District.

03:08:30.891 --> 03:08:36.454
Perseverance Prep School doesn't show to have the right personnel for the students.

03:08:36.474 --> 03:08:39.756
We need leaders with more experience to help our children.

03:08:54.805 --> 03:08:58.567
I am a parent of a child who is diagnosed with autism and it is very hard for us to find schools that can help us.

03:08:58.607 --> 03:09:01.048
And the few that exist might lose their funding because of these new schools.

03:09:24.366 --> 03:09:25.889
For regular kids, it's very hard to learn.

03:09:25.949 --> 03:09:28.353
Imagine for kids who have different disabilities.

03:09:28.373 --> 03:09:30.095
Thank you.

03:09:38.951 --> 03:09:39.431
Not my own.

03:09:39.692 --> 03:09:44.295
I'm also a parent in the San Jose Unified School District.

03:09:45.596 --> 03:10:05.791
And again, the state has found many things or lack of programs that will help and benefit those kids who are learning the language or that lack on, you know, they don't have high standards in school.

03:10:06.751 --> 03:10:09.552
And we are receiving them in our schools right now currently.

03:10:10.852 --> 03:10:15.253
And we see that they are promising things to parents that are not real.

03:10:16.393 --> 03:10:17.253
I see it all the time.

03:10:17.313 --> 03:10:21.034
Parents come to me and say, no, this school is gonna close at fifth grade.

03:10:21.674 --> 03:10:23.995
They start rumors that are not real.

03:10:25.075 --> 03:10:30.356
And a lot of our parents are thinking that we are gonna close the school because these new schools are gonna open.

03:10:31.357 --> 03:10:45.035
And just, you know, in our neighborhood, we have three charter schools, and these three charter schools are doing an excellent job, and we are pro-charter schools, but these charter schools that are trying to open, they're not ready.

03:10:45.395 --> 03:10:45.656
Thank you.

03:10:50.083 --> 03:10:50.683
Good afternoon.

03:10:50.743 --> 03:10:51.944
My name is Claire Crawford.

03:10:52.064 --> 03:10:59.930
I'm the senior policy analyst within the public interest, and I'm here to urge you to uphold the denials of the charter petition for Perseverance Preparatory School.

03:11:01.231 --> 03:11:10.818
Unfortunately, the State Board of Education has a troubling practice of approving deficient local charter petitions that have been rejected by school districts and counties in which they're expected to operate.

03:11:11.738 --> 03:11:25.586
In an analysis that we submitted via email, and which I have copies of here if you'd like printed copies, we found that between 2002 and 2017, the State Board of Education approved 71% of charters that had been denied at the local level.

03:11:26.346 --> 03:11:33.109
More troubling, our analysis found that fully a third of the charters approved at the State Board were not in operation any longer.

03:11:33.870 --> 03:11:44.855
Many of the problems identified by San Jose Unified and the Santa Clara County Board of Education in this petition are issues that have been raised before in petitions that resulted in SPE approval followed by school failure.

03:11:44.875 --> 03:11:51.858
I think the San Jose Unified School District has offered an alternative path forward and it might be a good option to take.

03:11:51.938 --> 03:11:52.198
Thank you.

03:12:02.658 --> 03:12:03.118
Good evening.

03:12:05.820 --> 03:12:07.001
My name is Victoria Cuenca.

03:12:09.002 --> 03:12:18.329
I also a parent of the San Jose Unified School District.

03:12:19.069 --> 03:12:22.291
I have a son in the Washington Elementary School and another one on the Sacred Heart.

03:12:22.311 --> 03:12:23.492
In my experience as a parent,

03:12:34.575 --> 03:12:35.876
has been very good in this case.

03:12:35.896 --> 03:12:38.438
I believe all schools should have good personnel, qualified personnel.

03:12:38.518 --> 03:12:40.120
And we'll speak about Promise School because we're leaving.

03:13:00.751 --> 03:13:10.414
For me, personally, it's very important the type of education that my children receive.

03:13:13.775 --> 03:13:27.300
Academy Promise does not have any criteria specifically for students with low academic standards.

03:13:28.066 --> 03:13:31.629
How are they going to help our kids if they don't have it in the plan?

03:13:31.649 --> 03:13:32.170
Thank you.

03:13:32.190 --> 03:13:32.590
Gracias.

03:14:00.134 --> 03:14:00.634
Good evening.

03:14:01.074 --> 03:14:02.355
My name is Monica Vasquez.

03:14:02.675 --> 03:14:07.977
I am here representing Washington Elementary School from the San Jose Unified School District.

03:14:08.538 --> 03:14:10.379
I have two kids in Washington Elementary.

03:14:26.141 --> 03:14:30.485
We have a very united group of mothers who are always on top of our kids, helping each other.

03:14:30.505 --> 03:14:35.671
We're always united, looking on our surroundings of our school to make sure that everything is functioning properly.

03:14:47.113 --> 03:15:08.125
Creo que las escuelas nuevas que aquí piensan abrir, deberían de tomar una opción para mejor darnos fondos a nosotros como ya somos una escuela plantada, todo ese fondo que se utiliza para académicamente nosotros también nuestras escuelas abrir mejores programas para nuestros hijos, tratando que otras escuelas abran, unas escuelas nuevas y les falle.

03:15:09.195 --> 03:15:21.601
Instead of opening new schools, I would rather see this money invested in our schools of our kids who are losing funding throughout the years.

03:15:21.761 --> 03:15:25.303
And not wasting the money on these new schools.

03:15:25.383 --> 03:15:29.285
Instead, investing in the schools that are already existing, I would love to see this happening.

03:15:38.820 --> 03:15:52.813
Creo que las escuelas nuevas que quieren hacer tengan la idea de mejorar para otras personas que en verdad lo necesitan, no porque quieren abrir una escuela y si no les funciona, sea dinero perdido.

03:15:53.994 --> 03:16:02.863
I want the schools that are forming as charter schools to think about the benefit of the people and not just thinking about opening schools.

03:16:10.478 --> 03:16:11.658
Hi, my name is Vera Sloan.

03:16:11.678 --> 03:16:15.819
I'm a San Jose Unified School District parent at a downtown elementary school.

03:16:16.379 --> 03:16:24.421
When I read Perseverance's petition last spring as a parent and a person from a poverty background, it broke my heart to think about vulnerable children being in the environment it describes.

03:16:24.961 --> 03:16:32.863
One where children are punitively denied what little arts education is offered if they do not have enough money in their account because of public punishment for developmentally normal behavior.

03:16:33.403 --> 03:16:45.368
an inexcusably vague education plan built around a self-help book written by a businessman, failure to designate appropriate programs and funding for special education and ELD students, and a director who has meager teaching experience of any kind.

03:16:45.948 --> 03:16:54.031
San Jose parents and community members spoke out locally against Perseverance and its differently troubled counterpart, Promise, which unfortunately the mothers here, we have to go pick up our children.

03:16:54.051 --> 03:16:55.432
We're not going to be able to stay and speak.

03:16:56.392 --> 03:17:01.853
We spoke about that in our own district and county, and our democratically elected representatives rightly did not issue these schools a charter.

03:17:02.333 --> 03:17:11.555
Most of these parents and community folks cannot drive for hours to Sacramento during a work and school day, so they created a letter to all of you, I have copies, asking you to respect our right to local control.

03:17:11.955 --> 03:17:14.236
Over 75 others have signed on just overnight.

03:17:14.696 --> 03:17:18.077
Please respect the decisions already made in your local community and vote to deny.

03:17:18.177 --> 03:17:18.537
Thank you.

03:17:31.212 --> 03:17:35.574
Trustees of the Board, my name is Tim Terarug, and I've taught at Cornerstone Academy for six years.

03:17:36.054 --> 03:17:41.017
I grew up on the east side, and I know the difference between the schools that I attended and the schools that I work at today.

03:17:41.657 --> 03:17:46.120
Cornerstone, in many ways, has become my home, and I've learned how a school can become a family.

03:17:47.020 --> 03:17:53.447
Cornerstone Academy was founded by Shara Hegde, a Building Excellence Schools fellow with commensurate experience as Ms.

03:17:53.487 --> 03:17:54.007
Lena Talley.

03:17:54.568 --> 03:17:55.809
Through this national nonprofit, Ms.

03:17:55.829 --> 03:18:02.736
Hegde worked relentlessly to create a successful school after studying the highest performing schools across the nation over one year.

03:18:03.377 --> 03:18:07.178
She was able to bring back what she had learned to better the community in San Jose.

03:18:08.138 --> 03:18:16.100
Currently, Cornerstone Academy outperforms their district by 20 points in ELA and almost doubles the district scores in math.

03:18:16.600 --> 03:18:23.162
Both Mission Prep and Cornerstone have strong track records and significantly outperform their districts as shown in the handout.

03:18:24.162 --> 03:18:25.202
If Shara, if Ms.

03:18:25.242 --> 03:18:29.083
Hegde had not been given her chance because of her youth,

03:18:30.335 --> 03:18:37.126
Cornerstone would not have existed and the 560 youth that we serve today wouldn't be placed in lower performing schools.

03:18:37.286 --> 03:18:37.547
Thank you.

03:18:45.953 --> 03:18:47.233
Hello, trustees of the board.

03:18:47.273 --> 03:18:49.634
My name is Andres Osuna and I'm a resident of San Jose.

03:18:50.614 --> 03:18:55.716
After hearing the model and mission of Perseverance Prep, I became involved with the community outreach and engagement.

03:18:56.536 --> 03:19:08.800
I find that San Jose Unified's claim that there isn't any community support is extremely hard to find because given the number of applications we've already received for an unapproved charter without a facility is just not balancing.

03:19:09.460 --> 03:19:18.432
Clearly, parents are excited and passionate about the mission and model of Perseverance Prep, and they have already signed up, having full faith that the charter's value will be clear and evident.

03:19:18.813 --> 03:19:23.419
Perseverance Prep is an opportunity to be a proof point in San Jose's community.

03:19:23.759 --> 03:19:25.361
We need schools like Perseverance Prep.

03:19:26.102 --> 03:19:29.003
And I really urge you guys to approve it.

03:19:29.324 --> 03:19:32.525
And I would just also like to add real quick that I am a student pilot.

03:19:33.065 --> 03:19:37.728
And I was the fastest pilot to ever be given a solo license.

03:19:37.808 --> 03:19:41.789
And if you never give somebody their wings, how on earth are they going to fly?

03:19:42.250 --> 03:19:42.590
Thank you.

03:19:50.899 --> 03:19:52.219
Good afternoon, trustees of the board.

03:19:52.259 --> 03:19:53.440
My name is Marissa Alonzo.

03:19:54.100 --> 03:19:56.641
As a parent, I want nothing but the best for my son.

03:19:57.081 --> 03:20:00.602
I want him to go to school and learn and be inspired.

03:20:01.182 --> 03:20:03.623
I want them to have a deep sense of compassion and empathy.

03:20:04.123 --> 03:20:09.305
Perseverance Prep's focus on service learning and general servant leadership is exactly how I hope to raise my son.

03:20:10.305 --> 03:20:17.489
I want them to be able to critically analyze the world around them while simultaneously being able to seek to serve and help others in need.

03:20:17.929 --> 03:20:24.513
The service learning component of a perseverance preparatory drives at the true purpose of education, to create and mold conscionable leaders.

03:20:25.194 --> 03:20:30.617
We need to reinvigorate civic engagement and ignite a fire of curiosity and a love of learning within our children.

03:20:31.616 --> 03:20:35.998
Through the service learning model, students will be able to see and understand why ethical leaders are necessary.

03:20:36.598 --> 03:20:42.200
I've been a social justice activist, and I believe in serving my community and leaving this world a better place.

03:20:43.000 --> 03:20:52.284
I don't pretend to know what my son will become, but I do know who he will become, a well-educated, compassionate person who also seeks to leave his community a better place.

03:20:52.844 --> 03:20:54.805
I deeply urge the board to approve Perseverance Prep.

03:20:55.045 --> 03:20:55.665
Thank you for your time.

03:21:02.063 --> 03:21:03.263
My name is Eric Escobar.

03:21:03.283 --> 03:21:05.664
I'm here on behalf of Vito who couldn't make it today.

03:21:06.504 --> 03:21:07.864
Good afternoon members of the board.

03:21:08.124 --> 03:21:12.385
My name is Vito and I am currently a parent of a fourth grade student named Vanessa.

03:21:13.085 --> 03:21:15.026
Education is a top priority in our family.

03:21:15.306 --> 03:21:18.086
It is very important to choose the best school for our daughter.

03:21:18.907 --> 03:21:25.308
As parents we have to make sure that schools can provide good quality education both academically and socially for our children.

03:21:25.948 --> 03:21:30.229
After researching schools for our daughter we found that many children struggle in middle school.

03:21:31.110 --> 03:21:40.501
Our daughter, Vanessa, currently loves to read, is excited to learn new concepts in math, and is thrilled by technological projects.

03:21:41.161 --> 03:21:43.684
As we look for middle school options, we know they are limited.

03:21:43.824 --> 03:21:49.211
We have seen an excitement and joy of learning grow in Vanessa and want to see it continue.

03:21:49.864 --> 03:21:56.766
We were so excited to hear about Perseverance Preparatory School, the mission, vision and service learning suits our daughter's needs.

03:21:57.486 --> 03:22:04.608
We are looking for a school that helps students succeed and we are confident that Perseverance Preparatory School will ensure our daughter's academic success.

03:22:06.049 --> 03:22:06.649
Thank you for your time.

03:22:12.042 --> 03:22:14.264
Good afternoon State Board of Education.

03:22:15.045 --> 03:22:18.108
My name is Vanessa Luciano and I am a former student of Ms.

03:22:18.128 --> 03:22:18.789
Lena Talley.

03:22:19.269 --> 03:22:29.159
During the finality of fifth grade my mother decided to withdraw me from public school since after researching no San Jose middle schools appeared to be a compatible fit for me.

03:22:29.659 --> 03:22:32.601
There's a dire need for quality options in San Jose.

03:22:33.061 --> 03:22:36.544
Right now I live in downtown with the zip code 95112.

03:22:36.944 --> 03:22:42.588
My options for middle schools in my neighborhood Hoover and Burnett rank at a dismal three according to great schools.

03:22:43.168 --> 03:22:53.975
Alternatively when looking at the California dashboard and all of the San Jose Unified School District only two schools are ranked blue or high performing in both English language arts and mathematics.

03:22:54.536 --> 03:22:56.457
One elementary and one middle school.

03:22:56.757 --> 03:22:59.399
No wonder parents and students are seeking other options.

03:22:59.779 --> 03:23:05.361
You simply can't funnel all the students into the one high-performing elementary and the one high-performing middle school.

03:23:05.941 --> 03:23:10.543
One is simply not enough and as a student and a leader I demand more than one.

03:23:11.043 --> 03:23:19.307
I'm a firm believer that all students deserve an excellent education and here at perseverance preparatory school we have an opportunity to do just that.

03:23:19.507 --> 03:23:23.648
I strongly urge you to vote to approve perseverance prep today for the children of tomorrow.

03:23:24.008 --> 03:23:24.889
Thank you for your time.

03:23:27.731 --> 03:23:29.412
I'd like to call the final speakers.

03:23:29.993 --> 03:23:30.694
Please line up.

03:23:31.034 --> 03:23:36.018
Colin Miller, Patrick Bernhardt, Ona Kelly, Terry Burns, and Roxana Maracci.

03:23:39.555 --> 03:23:41.536
Hi, everybody.

03:23:43.358 --> 03:23:51.185
My name is Robin Gokawin, and my daughter will enter San Jose Unified, I'm sure much sooner than I expect.

03:23:52.526 --> 03:23:56.069
My father was an immigrant, and my husband is also an immigrant.

03:23:56.529 --> 03:24:00.313
And I want to send my daughter to a school that celebrates and promotes her rich history.

03:24:00.853 --> 03:24:02.034
Perseverance is not that school.

03:24:03.035 --> 03:24:10.379
They are not prepared to serve English language learning students, nor the students with special needs and without the support of a diverse student body.

03:24:11.420 --> 03:24:15.262
The school cannot be a place that welcomes diversity or immigrant families and communities.

03:24:18.644 --> 03:24:23.208
plan on paper, and they don't have the experience to execute even a perfect plan.

03:24:24.189 --> 03:24:34.979
Further, they do not have the support of a lot of local San Jose parents, and if they do open and are not able to fill their school, then it will be a huge waste of money.

03:24:35.920 --> 03:24:40.925
I'm not against charters, but I am strongly against perseverance and also promise, which I cannot stay for.

03:24:45.171 --> 03:24:50.482
I will not only keep my daughter in attending a school like this, but I will also come all the way here to Sacramento and speak to all of you.

03:24:50.522 --> 03:24:52.726
So thank you so much for listening to us during your lunch.

03:24:58.564 --> 03:24:59.765
Promise not to be that cute.

03:25:00.205 --> 03:25:03.188
Eric Premack with the Charter Schools Development Center.

03:25:03.328 --> 03:25:06.311
We support the staff recommendation to grant the charter.

03:25:06.751 --> 03:25:15.339
I did want to raise a concern, though, about what we see as an ongoing trend of raising new types of criteria before a charter is granted in this one.

03:25:16.095 --> 03:25:23.822
department staff found that they were demonstrably unlikely to succeed because they hadn't received a grant pledge in cash form yet.

03:25:23.982 --> 03:25:28.345
And we think that that's way beyond normal expectation.

03:25:28.385 --> 03:25:34.150
We've worked with hundreds of schools that have received grant pledges well after the time the charter is granted.

03:25:35.311 --> 03:25:51.519
Adding those sorts of requirements to what it takes to get a charter approved is leading to what we call the charter arms race, where you have to write more and more and more stuff into your charter petition that just makes the process more complicated and leads to more appeals coming up here in the first place.

03:25:51.579 --> 03:26:00.464
And we would hope that the department would review some of those criteria and dial them back to what the law is really requiring us all to focus on.

03:26:00.584 --> 03:26:00.864
Thank you.

03:26:11.246 --> 03:26:16.430
Ken Bird on behalf of the California Teachers Association, I want to object to the one minute.

03:26:16.570 --> 03:26:18.492
It does disservice to what we're doing.

03:26:19.232 --> 03:26:24.456
Number two, I hope that this board picks up the cue that was said again and again.

03:26:24.476 --> 03:26:31.502
It's all about local control and you become a local control board but you don't carry that concept over here.

03:26:32.002 --> 03:26:37.046
So I hope it's not necessary for the legislature to put serious restrictions on you.

03:26:37.667 --> 03:26:39.428
Now the last point I want to make is

03:26:40.234 --> 03:26:42.334
I actually agree with Eric Premack.

03:26:42.815 --> 03:26:45.595
I want to go on record, but for a different reason.

03:26:47.475 --> 03:26:49.616
Either you gots the money or you don't.

03:26:50.236 --> 03:26:53.157
Either you have the financial ability or you don't.

03:26:54.037 --> 03:27:00.658
This is an expansion of saying, I'm going to let you have a charter if you can get your money on the come.

03:27:01.258 --> 03:27:01.998
That's wrong.

03:27:02.258 --> 03:27:09.840
Either you have the money and you've got a financial base, and the board does not need to get caught on another one of these charters

03:27:11.181 --> 03:27:13.782
either under fraud or inability to fund itself.

03:27:14.763 --> 03:27:17.364
So that's a new requirement.

03:27:17.524 --> 03:27:24.288
I don't think it ought to be there, but I think it's a condition of getting the charter of having adequate financial foundation.

03:27:24.768 --> 03:27:27.289
If you don't have that, you don't have anything, unfortunately.

03:27:34.540 --> 03:27:35.621
Good afternoon, members of the board.

03:27:35.701 --> 03:27:37.622
I'm reading on behalf of a parent who had a work commitment today.

03:27:38.383 --> 03:27:43.527
My name is Chad Hall, and I'm currently a parent of a third grade student named Chase and an 18-month-old named Alexandria.

03:27:43.827 --> 03:27:46.149
Our family, like so many others, value education.

03:27:46.549 --> 03:27:52.313
When I met with the founder, Alexander Elena Talley, I had never heard of a college preparatory program so set on empowering middle school students.

03:27:52.834 --> 03:27:58.318
Perseverance Prep isn't just about how well students read and write, but it also places a huge focus on character development.

03:27:59.419 --> 03:28:00.961
Now more than ever, we need ethical people.

03:28:01.301 --> 03:28:06.608
We need to be teaching students that their voices matter and they can be transformative leaders who seek to better their community.

03:28:07.409 --> 03:28:09.131
San Jose needs high performing middle schools.

03:28:09.251 --> 03:28:14.197
Each time I see the scores of students within San Jose, I am both deeply saddened and slightly enraged.

03:28:14.257 --> 03:28:15.599
That information you have from earlier.

03:28:16.259 --> 03:28:21.405
As previously mentioned, San Jose leaders with commensurate experience have gone on to lead successful and high-performing schools.

03:28:21.986 --> 03:28:28.352
Perseverance Prep is a school dedicated to raising those scores and raising the next generation of leaders focused on serving.

03:28:28.773 --> 03:28:32.176
As a parent, that is the kind of school I would want to send my children to.

03:28:32.397 --> 03:28:34.619
Please vote to approve Perseverance Prep.

03:28:34.979 --> 03:28:35.460
Thank you for your time.

03:28:40.250 --> 03:28:40.750
Good afternoon.

03:28:40.791 --> 03:28:43.173
I'm Cullen Miller with the California Charter Schools Association.

03:28:43.193 --> 03:28:47.016
We're in strong support of this petition and the CDE recommendation to approve it.

03:28:47.877 --> 03:28:52.682
Not all charter schools that get denied at the local level make it up to this level of appeal.

03:28:53.462 --> 03:29:01.890
Mostly you'll see just the ones that are really put together and the ones that CCSA supports also have gone through a very rigorous review process.

03:29:01.910 --> 03:29:03.232
So I wanted to just make that clear.

03:29:04.012 --> 03:29:05.653
I agree with Eric on the budget situation.

03:29:05.693 --> 03:29:12.578
I would want to note that while we're discounting things that are not in the bank, money that's in the bank, there are a lot of things that are changing.

03:29:12.618 --> 03:29:24.626
A budget is a plan, and as we saw just last week, the governor proposed a budget that included, you know, full implementation of LCFF, which will be a huge boost for this school as it moves forward next year.

03:29:25.406 --> 03:29:30.588
as well as $28 million for charter school facilities, which would also be a benefit to this school.

03:29:30.628 --> 03:29:39.632
So those things are not represented, as well as the charter school grant program, which the application has not been put out yet for them to even submit for yet.

03:29:39.732 --> 03:29:42.533
But if they're successful there, that's another $600,000.

03:29:42.773 --> 03:29:45.834
So there's a lot of money available.

03:29:46.914 --> 03:29:50.396
Budgets are fluid and planned, so I would just point that out.

03:29:50.416 --> 03:29:50.676
Thank you.

03:29:53.729 --> 03:29:54.450
Good morning, board members.

03:29:54.510 --> 03:29:55.490
My name is Patrick Bernhardt.

03:29:55.550 --> 03:29:57.592
I'm the president of the San Jose Teachers Association.

03:29:58.272 --> 03:30:02.836
We oppose the perseverance petition, but SJTA does not reflexively oppose all charter schools.

03:30:03.276 --> 03:30:10.582
We have been supportive of several of the charter schools that are existing in San Jose Unified today, both at the point of initial petition and reauthorization.

03:30:11.142 --> 03:30:16.204
We do, however, in evaluating charter petitions, prioritize evidence of local community support.

03:30:16.904 --> 03:30:31.108
We have some evidence today and at previous public hearings of community support from families that live outside of the San Jose Unified School District, but we have ample evidence that families that live inside the San Jose Unified School District are not interested in the perseverance petition.

03:30:31.448 --> 03:30:38.751
We've heard that there are 142 applications for the school, but we also heard today that the school had an insufficient number of in-district students to qualify for Prop 39

03:30:40.192 --> 03:30:47.622
facilities, which indicates to me that of the 142 applicants, the vast majority of them live outside of the San Jose Unified School District.

03:30:47.882 --> 03:30:55.051
We urge you to decline the petition and invite them to re-petition with San Jose Unified if they can demonstrate community support.

03:30:55.232 --> 03:30:55.512
Thank you.

03:30:59.264 --> 03:31:00.645
Hi, my name is Ona Keller.

03:31:00.685 --> 03:31:02.446
I'm with the California Teachers Association.

03:31:03.006 --> 03:31:15.114
I'd like to point out that, according to the Santa Clara County staff report, there are no employment positions at PPS, including the executive director, that require any type of general finance or public school finance, in particular, knowledge, training, or experience.

03:31:15.494 --> 03:31:23.539
Additionally, the petition does not comply with the Political Reform Act, Government Code 1090, and doesn't specify which positions would have to file a Form 700.

03:31:24.620 --> 03:31:32.924
I unfortunately was able to work with the teachers and the students and the community at Livermore Valley Charter School in their last year before they closed.

03:31:33.324 --> 03:31:40.427
It was a school that was authorized by you and then went back to the district level because they were not impressed with the level of oversight you were able to give that school.

03:31:40.747 --> 03:31:44.909
That school went bankrupt, and it was because they didn't have proper conflict of interest policies.

03:31:44.929 --> 03:31:46.510
They didn't have proper fiscal controls.

03:31:46.830 --> 03:31:48.250
They didn't have knowledge of

03:31:49.731 --> 03:31:50.853
of how to run a school budget.

03:31:51.074 --> 03:32:02.053
And so that had a devastating impact, not only on the almost thousand students that went to those charters, but also in the Livermore Valley Joint Unified School District, which had to pick up the pieces and accept hundreds of students into their schools.

03:32:02.273 --> 03:32:02.554
Thank you.

03:32:06.493 --> 03:32:09.396
Good afternoon, Terry Burns, California School Boards Association.

03:32:10.017 --> 03:32:19.547
As Member Holiday noted earlier this morning, the State Board should be judging appeals of charter applications as they come to you without significant changes from the applications.

03:32:19.977 --> 03:32:21.960
that were reviewed at the local level.

03:32:23.102 --> 03:32:36.621
We don't have a particular position on this or any of the charters before you today, but we believe it's inappropriate for the Board to approve a charter with material revisions that have not been part of the initial discussions in the community.

03:32:37.267 --> 03:32:48.232
Likewise, we believe that a State Board action to approve a charter with material revisions can work to discourage good dialogue at the local and the county level.

03:32:49.372 --> 03:32:56.476
As a principle, CSBA encourages charter determinations to be made locally based on dialogue between the parties.

03:32:56.716 --> 03:32:57.036
Thank you.

03:33:01.735 --> 03:33:03.677
Good afternoon, my name is Roxana Marishi.

03:33:03.817 --> 03:33:07.261
I'm the education chair of the San Jose Silicon Valley NAACP.

03:33:07.281 --> 03:33:17.291
I'm also a researcher studying local school closures and charter growth, specifically the disproportionate negative impacts of charter expansions on communities of color.

03:33:17.891 --> 03:33:23.333
You've been informed of numerous red flags and clear deficiencies in the Perseverance Charter petition.

03:33:23.353 --> 03:33:29.694
I've outlined some of these on the EDU Researcher blog, brought some hard copies for you as well with additional questions.

03:33:30.174 --> 03:33:47.619
The NAACP Movement for Black Lives, Journey for Justice, dozens of community, youth, education, and civil rights groups have backed the resolution calling for moratorium on charter expansion until laws can ensure transparency, effective oversight, democratic governance, and fair enrollment practices in the charter sector.

03:33:48.279 --> 03:33:55.302
You are in a critically important position with responsibility to serve and protect children in the state of California.

03:33:55.722 --> 03:34:00.764
We urge you to not turn a blind eye to the serious deficiencies that have been raised.

03:34:01.024 --> 03:34:04.885
To do so would be a disservice to the communities you serve.

03:34:04.985 --> 03:34:09.647
Please respect and uphold the unanimous decision of the San Jose Unified School District to deny this petition.

03:34:13.044 --> 03:34:17.786
Okay, that concludes the public comment and I now declare the public hearing closed.

03:34:18.586 --> 03:34:25.109
So we're ready for board member questions or responses to this.

03:34:26.250 --> 03:34:26.550
Pardon?

03:34:27.430 --> 03:34:31.612
Yes, the liaisons want to speak first, board member Holliday.

03:34:35.587 --> 03:34:37.788
Thank you and thank all the public speakers.

03:34:38.789 --> 03:34:43.591
I wouldn't prefer at this time to go ahead and let the board members ask any questions they have.

03:34:43.671 --> 03:34:48.694
I have some questions too, but I think it'd be best if we just open up conversation.

03:34:50.635 --> 03:34:51.756
Okay, Board Member Strauss.

03:34:53.997 --> 03:35:01.668
I would ask CDE to explain the conditions that you have now put on this, that you're recommending approval of conditions.

03:35:01.708 --> 03:35:09.098
So I'd like to understand the conditions and whether they're addressing some of the issues that were brought up in our testimony.

03:35:09.499 --> 03:35:10.721
So I think that would just be helpful.

03:35:11.932 --> 03:35:12.953
Okay, I will do my best.

03:35:14.956 --> 03:35:17.258
There are five conditions.

03:35:17.538 --> 03:35:23.906
So one is to accept, basically for the board to accept the state board conditions of authorization.

03:35:24.546 --> 03:35:29.933
But the others are in terms of reflecting the state board as the authorizing entity.

03:35:31.033 --> 03:35:33.674
because that currently is not in the petition.

03:35:33.814 --> 03:35:38.697
So that is something that would be obviously after the fact if it is indeed approved at the board level.

03:35:39.537 --> 03:35:51.602
We do have the third condition is about the fund, the 200,000 that is identified coming from the Silicon Schools Fund.

03:35:51.782 --> 03:35:56.284
So there is a condition to ensure that that is indeed part of the budget.

03:35:57.124 --> 03:36:01.227
The fourth condition is in terms of the facility.

03:36:01.788 --> 03:36:09.954
We do not know at the time, and the petitioner did not know at the time, in terms of whether they would have a Prop 39 facility through San Jose.

03:36:10.654 --> 03:36:12.496
What we heard today, it sounds like they do not.

03:36:13.497 --> 03:36:19.202
And a lot of times when they do come before us, they don't have the facility piece worked out yet.

03:36:19.542 --> 03:36:22.745
So we do want to know what the facility lease agreement is going to look like.

03:36:23.465 --> 03:36:28.970
And the fifth stipulation is a revised budget with a comprehensive narrative and assumptions.

03:36:30.011 --> 03:36:32.353
A big piece of this, again, is the facility costs.

03:36:32.513 --> 03:36:36.177
What are those costs going to be and how are they going to be reflected in the budget?

03:36:37.638 --> 03:36:37.798
Sure.

03:36:38.942 --> 03:36:47.946
Yeah, I'd like to ask, there's a, I think somebody testified for here that's from the Silicon Valley Schools Fund or is there some?

03:36:48.386 --> 03:36:50.227
Yeah, I'd like to ask that gentleman to come up.

03:36:56.509 --> 03:37:04.413
Can you describe what the situation is with your funding and a little bit about how you work and then

03:37:06.707 --> 03:37:10.891
Whether you support facility costs and how long you fund people.

03:37:11.272 --> 03:37:16.117
Often funding goes away after two years or something and then they're on their own.

03:37:16.630 --> 03:37:18.932
So I'd like to get a better idea of that.

03:37:19.032 --> 03:37:24.495
And then finally, what is the status of this application before your fund?

03:37:25.295 --> 03:37:27.357
You're a non-profit 401c3?

03:37:27.377 --> 03:37:29.498
Go ahead, just give us an overview.

03:37:29.578 --> 03:37:35.322
So I'm frankly a little surprised that this has caused so much confusion because we operate the same way any foundation would.

03:37:35.962 --> 03:37:36.763
We make a commitment.

03:37:36.863 --> 03:37:38.386
It goes through our board approval process.

03:37:38.886 --> 03:37:44.454
As I said, we've now deployed tens of millions of dollars over the last five years in the Bay Area for 40 plus schools.

03:37:44.855 --> 03:37:47.238
We've never once had a letter questioned.

03:37:47.639 --> 03:37:51.584
We provided two letters to staff affirming this commitment.

03:37:52.245 --> 03:37:56.909
The short version of this is any foundation will set requirements for what they expect a grantee to do.

03:37:57.229 --> 03:38:01.632
And if a grantee doesn't do that, they can't necessarily take you to court and enforce a future claim against you.

03:38:01.873 --> 03:38:03.414
That is the only requirement on our money.

03:38:03.954 --> 03:38:08.238
In 95% of all cases we have made grants, we have fulfilled the full and complete grant promise.

03:38:08.578 --> 03:38:11.320
They're only counting $200,000 of potential funding for us.

03:38:11.640 --> 03:38:12.481
We intend to make $800,000 of support.

03:38:14.082 --> 03:38:23.826
So, if any of the board members have any concern about fiscal adequacy from Silicon Schools Fund, I would say our track record of 40 schools and tens of millions of dollars should put your mind at ease in that regard.

03:38:24.406 --> 03:38:36.290
Our funding model is that we generally fund schools in year zero before they open, and then years one, two, and three, at which point their financial models hit break-even, and they can sustain themselves on per-pupil revenue, and that's what our funding is designed to do.

03:38:39.688 --> 03:38:55.563
I just want to say, in general, when I read this particular point, I also do work with charter schools and I depend a lot on foundations, so typically there is an award letter that goes out to folks, to the recipient.

03:38:56.905 --> 03:39:02.952
As somebody that subgrants, I'm not going to give you the money until you're approved, right?

03:39:03.012 --> 03:39:10.681
But once you're approved and you show approval, then there is an award letter and then becomes a memorandum of understanding or whatever that may be.

03:39:11.221 --> 03:39:13.222
So this is not an uncommon practice.

03:39:13.242 --> 03:39:22.207
This is someone that, if you're involved with foundations, non-profit world, even corporate grants, this is very typical.

03:39:22.267 --> 03:39:28.391
You do get a pledge for funding, but then there are some requirements that have to be met, and one of them is approval.

03:39:28.751 --> 03:39:31.933
You can't release money if there is no school to run.

03:39:32.273 --> 03:39:36.418
But there is pre-implementation funds that could be given.

03:39:36.718 --> 03:39:38.340
There's different levels of funding.

03:39:38.640 --> 03:39:39.561
And then there's a pledge.

03:39:39.841 --> 03:39:42.344
Once you get started, we will pledge this amount.

03:39:42.404 --> 03:39:44.726
But of course, you need approval before that happens.

03:39:44.967 --> 03:39:47.770
So I do have questions about the charter, but that wasn't one of them.

03:39:48.290 --> 03:39:48.871
That is accurate.

03:39:49.318 --> 03:39:57.526
Yeah, and of the 40 charters you've funded, how many have gone under quickly, or after you left them?

03:39:57.746 --> 03:39:59.567
Yeah, so all 40 are not charters.

03:39:59.627 --> 03:40:02.610
As I said, we work with district schools, including San Jose Unified.

03:40:02.650 --> 03:40:05.072
We have granted them as well, as well as independent schools.

03:40:05.453 --> 03:40:06.794
Zero schools have gone under.

03:40:07.274 --> 03:40:09.897
Our schools score at the 75th percentile of the state.

03:40:11.338 --> 03:40:12.739
Average same FRL.

03:40:12.979 --> 03:40:39.052
We don't support every school and as CCSA said you're seeing the best petitions that we've seen in a long time It's very ironic to find myself here twice in one day for two different petitions coming out of the same district I've never taken a step of driving to Sacramento to testify before but that's how strongly we feel in the quality of these applicants Thank you Yes, like member Ortiz Lacone I have wait a minute Brian I

03:40:41.545 --> 03:40:46.549
I also have, as you do, experience with philanthropies, and these are philanthropies.

03:40:47.610 --> 03:40:52.573
They are tax exempt the way that philanthropies are.

03:40:53.033 --> 03:40:56.876
But in particular, I also know Silicon Schools Fund.

03:40:57.536 --> 03:41:02.960
And I'll make the same comment at the next agenda item.

03:41:03.100 --> 03:41:08.124
Silicon Schools Fund and, what's the other one, SV,

03:41:08.544 --> 03:41:09.225
New Schools Venture Fund.

03:41:09.245 --> 03:41:10.326
New Schools Venture Fund.

03:41:11.527 --> 03:41:12.508
I know both of them.

03:41:12.629 --> 03:41:18.535
They only support the highest quality petitions and schools with the most promise.

03:41:19.116 --> 03:41:27.505
And schools, primarily schools that are dedicated to raising achievement in the lowest income students who might go on to become first gen students.

03:41:28.266 --> 03:41:31.747
And it's a kind of, so that's a common practice, number one.

03:41:32.127 --> 03:41:38.109
And second, they are the kind of organizations with the kind of reputation that don't squelch on their letters of commitment.

03:41:38.930 --> 03:41:41.130
If they've got a letter of commitment, it's money in the bank.

03:41:42.311 --> 03:41:43.151
That is accurate as well.

03:41:44.952 --> 03:41:46.232
Any other board member questions?

03:41:46.492 --> 03:41:47.773
Board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

03:41:50.053 --> 03:41:51.694
Board member Burr will go first.

03:41:52.693 --> 03:42:07.820
Just a clarification, and this is either for our liaisons or for Lisa, the conditions that you just enumerated again, my recollection is those are fairly common other than the ones that are specifically tailored to this one that we just heard about from an outside funder.

03:42:08.340 --> 03:42:26.370
but the revised budget that we always ask for that as I recall because there's typically both a delay in it coming to us that would affect what resources are available and as we heard earlier there's a governor's budget that's pending that would increase funding for all LEAs.

03:42:26.410 --> 03:42:35.815
So just wanted to clarify that because I heard a lot of testimony about us accepting material revisions which I did not see in this petition.

03:42:37.003 --> 03:42:37.584
I would agree.

03:42:37.604 --> 03:42:51.218
There are certain conditions after the fact that once the board takes action, and if it is a state board authorized charter, that then we do work out with the petitioner on behalf of the board.

03:42:51.238 --> 03:42:54.081
Board Member Ortiz-Lacon.

03:42:56.940 --> 03:43:10.785
You know, every time we have one of these hearings, there's the local control argument, and we absolutely believe in local control, but it is also in our responsibility to hear appeals, and there is a process for that.

03:43:10.945 --> 03:43:13.546
You know, we're not bypassing local control.

03:43:13.586 --> 03:43:18.748
That is something that we have the responsibility to do, is to hear these charter schools' petitions.

03:43:19.208 --> 03:43:24.310
And so, I just wanna say that, because every single hearing, we get that argument.

03:43:24.930 --> 03:43:31.055
But I have questions and I don't know if this should be directed to you or to the petitioner.

03:43:31.615 --> 03:43:44.766
One of the things that as a Latina, as a former English learner, as somebody who wants to make sure that our students receive the best quality education, it's always great that folks want to come into communities of color and assist.

03:43:45.166 --> 03:43:49.531
But there's always a chance that they won't.

03:43:49.771 --> 03:43:51.173
And it's on the backs of our students.

03:43:51.313 --> 03:43:53.715
So it could be successful, and that's great for our students.

03:43:54.076 --> 03:43:56.719
Or it could really be an experiment, and that's on our students.

03:43:57.359 --> 03:44:00.002
And my question is specific to EL students.

03:44:00.042 --> 03:44:01.584
I heard a lot of the parents mention that.

03:44:01.644 --> 03:44:03.025
I saw that throughout the petition.

03:44:03.766 --> 03:44:29.054
We received a letter, and I just want to clarify that this is actually true, that the initial petition had, under identifying, serving, and assessing English language learners, that the petition spelled out the acronym for SIOP, which is Shelter Instruction Observation Protocol, as Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology.

03:44:30.774 --> 03:44:39.857
That's a huge mistake for somebody who is working with EL students if you don't know the proper protocol or what it stands for.

03:44:40.597 --> 03:44:45.738
So for me, it's great that you wanna serve our students, but do you know how to serve our students?

03:44:45.978 --> 03:44:57.782
So I wanna know a little bit more about the experience of this charter petition or the leadership in working with students, with English learners, and in particular, in reviewing the petition

03:44:58.944 --> 03:45:03.798
That seems to be one of the items that needs improvement.

03:45:03.858 --> 03:45:06.124
Is that correct in terms of the educational plan?

03:45:08.144 --> 03:45:11.185
I will look through the petition and get back to you on that question.

03:45:11.265 --> 03:45:20.970
But I know that as we did go through the petition, we did identify in that area for English learners that they did have a comprehensive description of the plan for English learners.

03:45:21.310 --> 03:45:24.572
But I can look a little further and get back to you on that question.

03:45:24.632 --> 03:45:26.033
But in the meantime, if you wanted to hear.

03:45:26.093 --> 03:45:30.955
Yeah, because it's so easy to go back and look for the right terminology and put in the right practices.

03:45:31.015 --> 03:45:34.237
But if it's textbook and not experience, then that's very different.

03:45:39.373 --> 03:45:40.354
Thank you for your question.

03:45:41.395 --> 03:45:47.498
We did also receive the same blog post this morning, and frankly, there's no excuse.

03:45:47.598 --> 03:45:49.279
I do apologize for this oversight.

03:45:49.800 --> 03:45:51.401
I am familiar with SIOP.

03:45:51.481 --> 03:45:56.004
We use it regularly at Cornerstone Academy, and it is seen throughout the petition.

03:45:56.044 --> 03:46:03.048
So the reason why they think that we had a significant understanding of the ELL population that we're going to serve is because

03:46:03.548 --> 03:46:08.412
All of the nine protocols that SIOP includes are throughout the petition.

03:46:08.472 --> 03:46:27.265
So from training our teachers during the summer professional development, including both language objectives as well as content objectives, to ensuring that students are accessing their background schema, to ensuring that teachers are able to use Realia for ELL students to allow them to access that content.

03:46:27.826 --> 03:46:31.428
The strategies are all throughout the petition.

03:46:33.536 --> 03:46:38.700
I would hate for our entire petition to come down to this one error, but I do understand the concern.

03:46:38.720 --> 03:46:44.984
20% of the students in San Jose Unified are EL students, so it's not an error.

03:46:45.364 --> 03:46:48.146
It's an entire population, and that's my concern.

03:46:48.426 --> 03:46:48.726
Thank you.

03:46:48.746 --> 03:46:53.750
Board member Valdez.

03:46:54.335 --> 03:46:54.595
Okay.

03:46:55.256 --> 03:46:56.096
I just have a question.

03:46:56.116 --> 03:46:58.158
I'd like to have clarification on the leadership.

03:46:58.218 --> 03:46:59.499
Who's going to be running this school?

03:46:59.559 --> 03:47:01.280
Who has an administrative credential?

03:47:01.320 --> 03:47:07.966
Who understands the day-to-day operations, the financial considerations that have to be made on a daily basis?

03:47:08.346 --> 03:47:09.367
Who's going to be doing that?

03:47:10.060 --> 03:47:11.781
I am the proposed Executive Director.

03:47:11.921 --> 03:47:16.405
Ultimately, the Board will need to approve me as the Executive Director.

03:47:16.865 --> 03:47:28.454
I have taken part in a Building Excellence Schools Fellowship, so the two schools that you have been given, both Cornerstone Academy and Mission Preparatory School, were also founded through the same program.

03:47:28.814 --> 03:47:30.375
Overall, there's 668 hours of training, including

03:47:33.337 --> 03:47:40.789
budgeting, including finance, including curriculum, including instruction, as well as simply leadership training and coaching with teachers.

03:47:41.069 --> 03:47:43.373
So I have undergone that fellowship from the 2016 to 2017 school year.

03:47:49.157 --> 03:47:53.100
Charter schools do not need administrative credentials, right?

03:47:53.821 --> 03:47:54.541
Correct.

03:47:55.802 --> 03:47:56.343
Okay.

03:47:57.224 --> 03:47:57.644
Any other?

03:47:59.205 --> 03:48:01.527
I have a question while we're waiting.

03:48:02.828 --> 03:48:13.698
So, there's been this distinction between children who would go to this school who are in San Jose Unified and those that are not in San Jose Unified.

03:48:14.338 --> 03:48:15.720
And I want to explore that a little bit.

03:48:16.501 --> 03:48:18.324
I live near San Jose.

03:48:18.845 --> 03:48:23.992
The district, as they pointed out, has 19 school districts in its boundaries.

03:48:24.947 --> 03:48:30.472
And I think San Jose Unified has been described as a banana which sort of goes through the middle of the district.

03:48:31.012 --> 03:48:37.397
So there are a lot of small districts that have bought San Jose Unified, some medium-sized districts.

03:48:38.558 --> 03:48:44.944
And there has been, I know, in charter schools in San Jose, movement across boundaries.

03:48:45.084 --> 03:48:46.065
I talked to the

03:48:47.344 --> 03:49:00.574
superintendent of Franklin McKinley very recently and he said in one of his schools and it was typical that 45 percent of the students in his in the charters in Franklin McKinley were not from Franklin McKinley.

03:49:01.295 --> 03:49:11.263
So it's a little unclear where, you know, these students are going to come from but they're I wanted the board to know it's there are adjacent and you can't

03:49:12.203 --> 03:49:25.841
Uh, you know, when you go from the Union District to whatever the next district is, it's, you know, you go through some suburban streets and there's a shopping mall, a shopping strip and there's not a lot of clear delineation of, of a lot of the

03:49:26.718 --> 03:49:27.418
of this area.

03:49:27.478 --> 03:49:27.799
Yeah.

03:49:27.879 --> 03:49:34.181
So I, I wanted to explore, you know, what the demand is.

03:49:34.301 --> 03:49:39.064
And so maybe if San Jose Unified could come up and talk about this issue.

03:49:39.464 --> 03:49:46.847
As I understand our responsibility, we, we do not have to certify that the people will come from in the district.

03:49:46.887 --> 03:49:48.288
They can come from anywhere.

03:49:48.928 --> 03:49:50.949
So maybe you could comment on this, Matt.

03:49:51.049 --> 03:49:52.250
Can I just clarify?

03:49:52.290 --> 03:49:58.855
So our schools themselves are built so that anyone in this entire state of California can apply to our school.

03:49:59.195 --> 03:50:00.136
So if somebody from L.A.

03:50:00.176 --> 03:50:02.498
really wants to make the commute, they absolutely can.

03:50:03.378 --> 03:50:06.701
What our safeguard is, is our lottery preferences.

03:50:06.781 --> 03:50:10.724
So once we exceed our capacity, which we already have, of 128 seats our first year,

03:50:12.745 --> 03:50:14.166
We've already had 142.

03:50:14.567 --> 03:50:21.172
Our lottery protocol allows for us choosing or preferencing in-district students first.

03:50:21.452 --> 03:50:24.775
I believe for our very first year, it's in-district students first.

03:50:25.655 --> 03:50:31.640
For subsequent years, we allow siblings in ahead of them, and then go to out-of-district students.

03:50:31.680 --> 03:50:37.525
So no matter what, our lottery preferences allow for those in-district students to be allowed into our school first.

03:50:42.575 --> 03:50:50.199
We totally agree, charter schools don't have district boundaries, but one of the concerns we have is the health of the system, including the existing charter schools.

03:50:50.799 --> 03:50:55.802
So we talked to all the petitioners about doing a demand analysis and making sure they're very aware of the landscape.

03:50:56.282 --> 03:51:03.586
When we received this petition, we flagged right away that none of the existing middle school charters were cited in the petition for their wait lists.

03:51:04.306 --> 03:51:12.317
That doesn't mean this couldn't be a good quality program, but it is, in the intent of the law in 1992, it's to create competition and opportunities for families and teachers.

03:51:13.220 --> 03:51:16.802
We also think we have a responsibility to balance that against schools opening and closing.

03:51:17.242 --> 03:51:26.106
We've tried to get all of the charter operators in San Jose and the county together so they start coordinating on when they submit petitions so they're more likely to be successful.

03:51:26.706 --> 03:51:30.428
And we showed in the slides, Santa Clara County is a charter welcoming county.

03:51:30.488 --> 03:51:33.049
San Jose Unified has 10 charter schools open already.

03:51:33.650 --> 03:51:35.771
One of the concerns is they're not at full capacity.

03:51:36.591 --> 03:51:44.078
In downtown San Jose, in our borders, there are three charter middle schools serving the same demographic and none of them are full.

03:51:44.779 --> 03:51:47.822
That puts a budget pressure on all four of them if Perseverance were to open.

03:51:48.462 --> 03:51:50.965
They're going to compete for the same population of students.

03:51:51.545 --> 03:51:54.748
And that just is something that the board, we think, should consider.

03:51:54.848 --> 03:51:56.210
We understand that under charter law,

03:51:57.901 --> 03:52:07.228
That is what potential finding when the CD says demonstrably unlikely to implement the program because of budget concerns That was our point that we do think it is worth noting.

03:52:07.268 --> 03:52:12.252
There are three charter middle schools accepting applications accepting students and some of them are

03:52:13.923 --> 03:52:15.224
struggling with enrollment already.

03:52:15.664 --> 03:52:17.646
So the competition in our area is happening.

03:52:17.666 --> 03:52:21.888
We think it's essential that the board distinguishes us between other counties where there is not parent choice.

03:52:22.609 --> 03:52:31.755
Right now as family in downtown Santa Zena has three charter middle schools to choose from and because of the desegregation court order in the 80s, all of our schools are choice schools as well.

03:52:32.695 --> 03:52:37.679
There are 10 charter middle schools in our boundaries and 41 traditional schools with a choice enrollment process.

03:52:37.719 --> 03:52:39.620
We maintain what's called a voluntary integration plan

03:52:40.280 --> 03:52:42.502
All of our families have the ability to move schools.

03:52:43.162 --> 03:52:50.987
So families often choose schools for various reasons, neighborhood, commute, work, but in San Jose Unified, you can choose any of our schools.

03:52:51.047 --> 03:52:56.231
We have high-performing schools, we have schools we need to do better with, but we value that choice system, we value the equity system.

03:52:56.251 --> 03:52:59.833
You heard the superintendent say we want high-quality options.

03:52:59.973 --> 03:53:08.299
We've approved a lot of charters, and I want to make sure you understand there are three charter schools in the same demographic, in the same location, and none of them are full.

03:53:12.029 --> 03:53:15.251
Hey, Board Member Holliday?

03:53:16.491 --> 03:53:17.052
Yes, thanks.

03:53:18.052 --> 03:53:18.412
Pardon me.

03:53:18.752 --> 03:53:36.001
To go back to Terry Byrne's comment earlier, I do think this board is very sensitive to the notion of material revisions that are inappropriate and change what the local district and county examined in the petition.

03:53:36.561 --> 03:53:41.344
And I do think that we certainly in this case are not stepping over any line whatsoever.

03:53:42.205 --> 03:53:52.790
Secondly, I also think that it's very clear that there's a significant amount of funding promised to this school, and I see no reason why that funding wouldn't come.

03:53:53.991 --> 03:54:08.459
I do have a concern about the English ELD comments that Member Ortiz-Lacombe made, and I'm not entirely satisfied with the response from the petitioner.

03:54:09.159 --> 03:54:11.080
I'd ask you to come back up one more time, please.

03:54:16.337 --> 03:54:19.699
So a mistake was made, an error was made.

03:54:19.719 --> 03:54:29.867
I don't think in any sense you meant to discard a significant population of students who may attend your school.

03:54:31.188 --> 03:54:43.496
But you do need to prove to us that as best you can, that you and your team will be capable of serving these students in a high quality professional way.

03:54:43.636 --> 03:54:44.237
Can you do that?

03:54:45.963 --> 03:54:48.384
And thank you for your question and thank you for allowing me to clarify.

03:54:49.085 --> 03:54:54.907
Again, Cornerstone Academy worked very closely with a high population of ELL students.

03:54:55.927 --> 03:55:04.291
We had over 20% of our students were ELL, and as you can see, our test scores prove that our ELL students were outperforming the district by upwards of 20 points.

03:55:05.311 --> 03:55:24.040
So, as a teacher there and as a teacher who was able to reclassify 100% of her ELL students when I taught fifth grade and 97% of my students when I taught sixth grade, it is very clear that I know and understand how to serve those students and how to get them where they need to go.

03:55:24.060 --> 03:55:27.462
Okay, thank you.

03:55:31.604 --> 03:55:32.164
Yes, please.

03:55:32.304 --> 03:55:33.945
I'd be happy to hear your perspective.

03:55:33.965 --> 03:55:34.265
Thank you.

03:55:36.277 --> 03:55:37.557
Thank you so much, I appreciate it.

03:55:37.577 --> 03:55:42.519
I'm Jackie Zeller, I'm the Associate Superintendent in San Jose Unified, and I oversee Division of Instruction.

03:55:42.859 --> 03:55:53.063
This is Jodi Lacks, she is our Director of Elementary Curriculum Instruction, has worked for years with English learners, and is adamant about rights of English learners.

03:55:53.723 --> 03:56:02.646
We judge the petition based on what's written in the petition, not what was the intent or what we think that they might mean or are going to do.

03:56:03.186 --> 03:56:07.709
So, I'd like Jody to talk just for a minute about what we saw in the petition.

03:56:09.170 --> 03:56:09.590
Good morning.

03:56:09.650 --> 03:56:10.431
I think it's still morning.

03:56:12.012 --> 03:56:17.816
We had some serious concerns about speaking to the program, and I do understand that Ms.

03:56:18.296 --> 03:56:25.821
Natale, I'm sorry, I probably said that wrong, but she may have been a wonderful teacher, but that does not always equate to coaching and being able to lead other people.

03:56:26.341 --> 03:56:29.483
and being able to train them to do what is needed for English learners.

03:56:30.383 --> 03:56:33.765
The plan does not have any focus on English language development.

03:56:33.805 --> 03:56:41.408
There's a minimal reference to the ELD standards, but their focus for supporting students that are English learners is based on basic skills.

03:56:41.908 --> 03:56:46.450
And we know that there's a difference between ELA skills and English language development.

03:56:46.851 --> 03:56:51.673
There's no focus on using their home language or honoring their home language and building on that.

03:56:52.293 --> 03:56:56.215
and there's no focus on quality reclassification processes.

03:56:56.556 --> 03:57:03.279
They haven't even mentioned the fact that teachers have input and should be a part of the reclassification process.

03:57:03.720 --> 03:57:07.902
They don't even list that in their reclassification criteria, which concerns me.

03:57:11.716 --> 03:57:21.298
The other piece that concerns me is that the EL focus, the ELD support that they're planning on providing, they would be pulling students out of speech and debate or content area.

03:57:21.358 --> 03:57:23.379
It's different in different parts of their plan.

03:57:23.879 --> 03:57:29.220
And I don't believe that our English learners should be pulled out of those core pieces of content and instruction.

03:57:32.381 --> 03:57:32.681
Thank you.

03:57:32.701 --> 03:57:36.822
Board member Williams.

03:57:39.343 --> 03:57:41.123
If I could hear from the petitioner again.

03:57:47.182 --> 03:57:51.423
Can you explain the speech and debate and ELD connection and how that would work?

03:57:51.723 --> 03:57:52.023
Thank you.

03:57:52.043 --> 03:57:53.063
I appreciate your question.

03:57:53.523 --> 03:57:56.284
So we are not pulling any students out of speech and debate.

03:57:56.304 --> 03:57:59.205
Speech and debate is an integral part of our core curriculum.

03:57:59.505 --> 03:58:06.686
We have specifically aligned it to the ELD standards so that students have designated instruction during that time.

03:58:06.746 --> 03:58:13.228
So each of the students, based on their specific levels, are placed in different speech and debate

03:58:13.908 --> 03:58:22.215
So for example, if you have 128 students, 32 students who are at a level one, for example, would all go into this classroom for their specific lesson.

03:58:22.495 --> 03:58:31.502
So speech and debate, we then restructure the students to going to each of their levels based on their current classification.

03:58:32.103 --> 03:58:34.304
So we're not pulling students out during speech and debate.

03:58:34.345 --> 03:58:36.046
It's so critical that they're there for that.

03:58:36.346 --> 03:58:54.813
So what I envision when you say that, and I'm not a specialist in either one of these, is that you're using the speech and debate format and the critical thinking skills and the arguing from evidence and all of that stuff as the format for also doing ELD.

03:58:55.353 --> 03:58:57.553
Correct, for our designated instruction.

03:58:57.593 --> 03:59:00.474
For our integrated instruction, that takes place throughout the day.

03:59:01.154 --> 03:59:09.336
So for our designated instruction, which is also very clear because our speech and debate scope and sequence is aligned to those English language development standards.

03:59:09.396 --> 03:59:14.977
So I'm unclear as to why we would align them if then we're gonna be pulling out our ELL students.

03:59:15.017 --> 03:59:16.597
Right, it makes it unnecessary to pull out.

03:59:17.477 --> 03:59:20.058
I have another question and that is,

03:59:22.138 --> 03:59:38.501
I know ELD instruction is not the same thing, is very specific, but I have some, I'm wondering what, the students that have signed up, the parents that have signed up indicating interest in enrolling, what is their demographics?

03:59:39.262 --> 03:59:40.762
We do not pull their demographics.

03:59:41.762 --> 03:59:43.642
That's part of our lottery process.

03:59:43.662 --> 03:59:45.243
We just have their name, their address.

03:59:48.145 --> 03:59:53.209
So in terms of where you're planning to locate and where you've recruited and that kind of thing, what is the demographic?

03:59:53.269 --> 03:59:56.192
It is a large ELL population and a large Hispanic population.

03:59:56.272 --> 03:59:57.332
And large low income?

03:59:57.853 --> 03:59:58.874
Yes, that as well.

03:59:59.394 --> 04:00:06.279
Again, given that we don't know necessarily where our facilities are, we were looking at the 95112 zip code and the 95126 zip code.

04:00:07.040 --> 04:00:14.786
But based on where we find facilities, we may be having to bus students or to change our location.

04:00:15.262 --> 04:00:26.467
And what is your response to the district's point that there are three middle schools in a similar kind of geographic area that aren't at capacity right now?

04:00:27.003 --> 04:00:29.524
Again, I think that we have very different programs.

04:00:29.564 --> 04:00:30.884
We have an extended school day.

04:00:30.964 --> 04:00:32.184
DCP and ACE don't.

04:00:32.764 --> 04:00:37.225
I also think that we have a very different, quite frankly, academic model.

04:00:37.285 --> 04:00:39.005
We are a college preparatory program.

04:00:39.586 --> 04:00:42.726
And while DCP is, they're located in a very different area.

04:00:42.746 --> 04:00:49.868
To the best of my knowledge, ACE, in fact, does have a wait list, according to the call that I had with them yesterday.

04:00:49.888 --> 04:00:53.889
And one of their leadership team members sits on our board.

04:00:53.969 --> 04:00:55.829
So I think we just have very different information.

04:00:57.344 --> 04:01:11.572
Okay, one last point I wanna make while you're still standing here is that I have some data on San Jose Unified School District and this is the most current data from 2016-17 that was posted by CDE in late September.

04:01:12.912 --> 04:01:22.938
And it indicated that on the CASP that students meeting or exceeding standards that the Latinos population in San Jose Unified School District, 35% of the Latino population.

04:01:25.680 --> 04:01:39.656
met or exceeded those standards compared to 72% of the white and 86% of the Asian, and pretty much roughly the same for math, that the graduation rate was lower for the Latino population, 83% compared to the mid-90s.

04:01:42.038 --> 04:02:01.274
for those other two, and the percent of students who have graduated and have completed college admission requirements, CSU, UC, 33% for Latino, 61% for white, 78% for Asian students in the San Jose Unified School District.

04:02:01.834 --> 04:02:09.700
So how would you describe what you hope to make different for the Latino students in that area?

04:02:11.081 --> 04:02:26.191
very similar to, again, Cornerstone Academy, ensuring that we are reaching and not only surpassing the typical proficiency of any San Jose Unified student, but are in fact making them beyond or more advanced than their white or Asian counterparts.

04:02:26.611 --> 04:02:29.874
We want to ensure that they're set on the same trajectory that everybody else is.

04:02:29.894 --> 04:02:38.319
The fact that you have 83% of students on a college trajectory, whereas it drops drastically, I think that that's unfair and unequitable.

04:02:39.676 --> 04:02:40.176
Okay, thank you.

04:02:40.196 --> 04:02:45.059
Vote number holiday.

04:02:45.619 --> 04:02:45.960
Thank you.

04:02:45.980 --> 04:02:46.960
You may sit down, please.

04:02:47.280 --> 04:02:47.541
Thanks.

04:02:48.961 --> 04:03:02.369
Based upon the ACCS unanimous recommendation, based upon the CDE's recommendation, based upon what we've heard today, I make the motion to approve the CDE recommendation.

04:03:04.770 --> 04:03:05.531
I second the motion.

04:03:07.776 --> 04:03:09.477
Further board discussion?

04:03:11.958 --> 04:03:13.840
Okay all those in favor raise your hands.

04:03:15.981 --> 04:03:19.223
Okay there's one abstention.

04:03:20.323 --> 04:03:21.724
Okay the motion carries.

04:03:22.905 --> 04:03:24.926
Thank you and I think we'll take a break.

04:03:25.867 --> 04:03:27.207
So let's come back at 1.15.

04:03:35.638 --> 04:03:38.399
program due to an unrealistic financial plan.

04:03:39.720 --> 04:03:47.264
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools considered the Promise Academy petition for establishment at its December 7, 2017 meeting.

04:03:47.964 --> 04:03:52.526
The ACCS moved staff recommendation to deny the Promise Academy petition.

04:03:53.147 --> 04:03:56.568
The motion did not pass by a vote of 3 to 2.

04:03:57.369 --> 04:04:01.531
Five votes are required to move an ACCS motion forward to the State Board.

04:04:01.991 --> 04:04:04.152
Therefore, no recommendation was moved.

04:04:06.448 --> 04:04:15.236
Promise Academy proposes to serve 210 pupils in TK through grade 2, 5, and grade 6 in 2018-19 school year.

04:04:16.477 --> 04:04:26.106
Promise Academy will then expand their services each year over a seven-year term to 280 pupils in TK through grade 3 and grade 5 and grade 7 in 19-20.

04:04:29.225 --> 04:04:37.990
385 pupils in TK through grade 9 in 2021-22, 420 pupils in TK through grade 10 in 2022-23, 455 pupils in TK through grade 11 in 2023-24, and 490 pupils in TK through grade 12 in 2024-25.

04:04:52.659 --> 04:05:05.644
The CDE finds that Promise Academy does not provide for adequate accommodations for all subgroups of pupils, including English learners, long-term English learners, foster homeless youth, and pupils with disabilities.

04:05:06.864 --> 04:05:11.406
Based on information listed in the petition, under Promise graduation requirements,

04:05:11.906 --> 04:05:23.412
Pupils must complete the Scholastic Aplitude Test, SAT, or the American College Testing, ACT, to University of California or California State University eligibility standards.

04:05:24.272 --> 04:05:26.953
They must complete three advanced placement tests,

04:05:30.427 --> 04:05:32.388
Yes, or college courses, I'm sorry.

04:05:33.288 --> 04:05:35.689
Did I say, I apologize, college courses.

04:05:36.890 --> 04:05:46.234
Complete a college readiness course, develop a college plan, complete at least four applications to four-year colleges, and gain acceptance at at least one four-year university.

04:05:47.250 --> 04:06:01.588
The only required courses for high school graduation offered in grade 11 and grade 12 are AP English Language, AP English Literature, AP Biology, AP Physics, AP US History, and AP Government and Economics.

04:06:02.629 --> 04:06:14.117
Additionally, the CDE finds that Promise Academy's graduation requirements would appear to constitute an impermissible pupil fee and therefore violate Ed Code section 49011B1.

04:06:15.038 --> 04:06:24.245
The requirements to complete three AP tests, SAT and ACT, and submit at least four applications to four-year colleges would constitute an expense to the pupil.

04:06:26.033 --> 04:06:40.257
CDE notes that Promise Academy has made no provision either in the petition, the projected monthly multi-year budget, or the budget narrative and assumptions to offset these expenses to pupils in order for them to meet Promise Academy's graduation requirements.

04:06:41.517 --> 04:06:49.920
Subsequently, the CDE also finds that Promise Academy is not able to successfully implement the intended program due to an unrealistic financial plan.

04:06:51.348 --> 04:07:00.999
Promise Academy's budget includes fundraising targets for each year and does not provide estimated rent for a private facility in the downtown area of San Jose Unified School District.

04:07:01.640 --> 04:07:07.847
The CDE was not able to determine if the 2018-19 budget amounts, particularly for facilities, would be sufficient.

04:07:08.768 --> 04:07:11.251
CDE staff is available for any questions that you may have.

04:07:13.749 --> 04:07:14.109
Thank you.

04:07:14.329 --> 04:07:18.273
Okay, we will again have a public hearing to start then public comment.

04:07:18.793 --> 04:07:27.540
So I declare the public hearing open and we will give the proponents for the charter the first shot and with 10 minutes.

04:07:37.148 --> 04:07:37.268
Okay.

04:07:38.897 --> 04:07:43.560
Good afternoon, I believe, President Kirst, board members, CDE staff, and guests.

04:07:44.021 --> 04:07:47.463
My name is Dr. Anthony Johnson, and I'm the school founder with Promise Academy.

04:07:48.103 --> 04:07:54.408
And on behalf of our families and supporters, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to present today about our journey in our school.

04:07:55.409 --> 04:07:58.591
I would also like to thank the CDE staff for their work and feedback on our petition.

04:07:59.778 --> 04:08:08.406
Over the past year and a half, a dedicated group of parents in San Jose have worked to help design a small school with robust individualized supports for each child.

04:08:09.127 --> 04:08:13.591
A small representation of those parents are here today on behalf of our larger group of parent leaders.

04:08:15.245 --> 04:08:24.227
As I've personally spoken to and met with hundreds of families in downtown San Jose, many times in their living rooms, they've expressed what they want in a school for their babies.

04:08:25.107 --> 04:08:29.207
What's resonated with me most is that you can't hear their stories and be unchanged.

04:08:29.928 --> 04:08:31.308
My story is their story.

04:08:31.868 --> 04:08:38.789
Just like the majority of our families in downtown San Jose, I'm a person of color who grew up in poverty with a single mother and loving grandparents.

04:08:39.509 --> 04:08:42.710
They did not know much about the schools or other options they may have had.

04:08:43.519 --> 04:08:47.362
It wasn't until the 11th grade that a teacher pulled me aside and gave me personal attention.

04:08:47.862 --> 04:08:49.843
She showed me my work and the work of other students.

04:08:50.364 --> 04:08:53.966
She changed my schedule without my permission, and she placed me in advanced classes.

04:08:54.767 --> 04:09:00.311
She changed my trajectory and made me to see myself as a scholar instead of just an athlete or an at-risk kid.

04:09:03.200 --> 04:09:14.026
This led me to attend college, where I gained my bachelor's degree in English and a minor in Spanish, played professional baseball for a short time, and then got a master's degree in curriculum instruction and my doctorate in educational leadership.

04:09:14.606 --> 04:09:20.049
I've dedicated my life's work to education and changing the trajectory of our most vulnerable students and families.

04:09:20.809 --> 04:09:24.731
The lens I bring to Promise Academy is that of father and my hopes for my own children.

04:09:25.051 --> 04:09:26.272
And this is my most important job.

04:09:26.772 --> 04:09:32.215
But in my professional experience as a teacher of English language development and as a school leader for seven years,

04:09:34.403 --> 04:09:36.304
I know the importance of a quality education.

04:09:37.345 --> 04:09:39.866
And I also know the importance of experience.

04:09:40.266 --> 04:09:48.711
I've launched a large comprehensive high school from the ground up, a $90 million project in the Central Valley, in the city of Merced.

04:09:49.371 --> 04:09:50.492
This was a one-to-one school.

04:09:51.752 --> 04:10:01.535
And I feel blessed to be able to stand before you because deep down I know, after being a high school principal for a long time, that 11th grade is too late to start having high expectations for students and robust individualized supports.

04:10:02.315 --> 04:10:13.297
A student's preparedness for college and career should not be based on luck, but rather on a strategic approach and systemic supports that make sure no matter a child's address, color, or income level, we have the same expectations and a better outcome.

04:10:13.618 --> 04:10:15.158
And that's how we designed Promise Academy.

04:10:19.215 --> 04:10:28.098
Very briefly, what you see on the left side of your screen are the core values that our parents established prior to designing Promise Academy, and these values are aligned to the best of their family values they hold so dear.

04:10:28.999 --> 04:10:39.143
The goal for our school is to provide an environment of rigorous daily instruction, be culturally responsive to the needs of our students, to help them to understand, and ultimately use what they've learned to better understand and affect the world around them.

04:10:41.824 --> 04:10:47.666
How this plays out is listed here on the screen for our students who will be entering our school, hopefully next year.

04:10:48.837 --> 04:10:50.118
Let's call this student Esmeralda.

04:10:50.638 --> 04:10:55.763
Her school day begins with social-emotional learning and developing empathy and awareness towards people and situations.

04:10:56.183 --> 04:10:59.325
The theme for this unit is the contribution of persons with disabilities.

04:10:59.866 --> 04:11:06.311
Throughout this unit, Esmeralda will participate in discussions, journaling, guided reading, research, guest speakers, et cetera.

04:11:06.872 --> 04:11:09.474
In her math class, she'll be learning the concept of slope,

04:11:10.234 --> 04:11:13.076
in small groups, direct academic instruction.

04:11:13.797 --> 04:11:21.602
In her English class, she'd be reading a novel written by a person with disabilities and learning to analyze text and research the challenges of persons with disabilities.

04:11:22.102 --> 04:11:33.490
And lastly, in the Innovation Lab, which is inspired by and in partnership with the Tech Museum of Innovation in downtown San Jose, she will complete a design challenge where she measures and assesses the slope of ADA ramps,

04:11:34.490 --> 04:11:41.835
of local stores and organizations, plugs her data into the slope formula, then researches ADA regulations to determine if these ramps are compliant.

04:11:42.195 --> 04:11:47.058
If they are not, she will build a prototype of those in our innovation lab that make them compliant.

04:11:52.721 --> 04:11:52.921
Thank you.

04:11:57.398 --> 04:12:05.541
In our more than 100 pages that we submitted with our petition, there's one page that has garnered more attention, and that is the chart on page 82 that lists our goals for graduates.

04:12:06.162 --> 04:12:12.204
We've gotten really good feedback from the CDE staff and the ACCS, and we realized that this page in our petition could have been clearer.

04:12:12.644 --> 04:12:21.488
And we're glad to have the opportunity to clarify our intent on the record and highlight how all supports for students with various learning styles and abilities are fully outlined in this petition.

04:12:22.228 --> 04:12:29.795
First, I want to give the reason behind having a school with high expectations, especially as it pertains to our community in downtown San Jose.

04:12:30.556 --> 04:12:40.365
As it currently stands in downtown San Jose, only 35% of low-income students of color graduate from high school having completed all requirements that make them eligible for four-year colleges and universities.

04:12:40.905 --> 04:12:44.847
We wrote our petition based on community need and our aspirations for our children.

04:12:45.407 --> 04:12:50.430
This is not to say all students will choose to enroll in a four-year college or university, which is perfectly fine.

04:12:50.810 --> 04:13:01.676
But as parents, we are fearful that this trend, if not corrected, will continue and more than 60% of our children who we feel have limitless potential will not even have the option of attending college.

04:13:02.679 --> 04:13:11.766
Other great schools such as Summit, Aspire, East Bay Innovation Academy have similar or even more rigorous graduation requirements and are getting great results for our traditionally mostly underserved students.

04:13:12.967 --> 04:13:26.797
They made the big bet that if they closed the expectation gap for some students versus others and provided additional supports to ensure they met those expectations, then more students would have an opportunity to experience college, change their trajectory, and change the lives of their families.

04:13:30.063 --> 04:13:34.868
We're confident that we can achieve our goals for students because we have robust systems of support in place.

04:13:35.389 --> 04:13:41.216
Here on the screen, you'll see how multiple protected categories of students will be served along with all students.

04:13:42.945 --> 04:13:55.989
Some of these are our one-to-one weekly reflection meetings, which is rare in most schools, college readiness course and plan, application and AP test fee support as required by law, college course fee support, and academic counseling services.

04:13:56.830 --> 04:14:00.911
Each of these supports are outlined in our original petition as written as well in our budget.

04:14:01.751 --> 04:14:09.494
Lastly, we have been and will continue to advertise these systems to our target population of students so they realize that this is an option for them in their community.

04:14:10.606 --> 04:14:19.374
After successfully launching a much larger school with the College Prep Pathway, I know it will be important that our elementary students will be college focused from a very young age.

04:14:20.374 --> 04:14:27.981
The College Prep Pathway that I launched at my last high school consisted of 300 students who were within the general population of about 1,500 students.

04:14:28.321 --> 04:14:36.969
These were students who were students, mostly students of color, mostly low income, mostly C average students who we challenged and placed into AP courses with supports.

04:14:38.240 --> 04:14:39.322
We experienced success.

04:14:40.023 --> 04:14:50.782
Our first graduating class of 280 students, we had a 96% graduation rate, and approximately 60% were accepted to a four-year college and university, mostly low-income, mostly students of color.

04:14:51.730 --> 04:15:00.832
Unlike other large comprehensive high schools, we will only have 35 graduates per year, which will allow us to give individual attention to those students and families who need more help and guidance.

04:15:01.252 --> 04:15:07.474
Additionally, our first graduating class will be in the year 2025, so seven years from now.

04:15:08.154 --> 04:15:12.855
We're essentially an elementary school that will grow very slowly into the high school portion of our model.

04:15:13.896 --> 04:15:19.137
Much longer runway with students we think will get us there, and also more time to make adjustments to their needs.

04:15:22.552 --> 04:15:28.857
Here are other questions that we've provided responses to that were great questions from the ACCS Commission and the CDE staff.

04:15:29.537 --> 04:15:32.279
One that I would like to focus on very briefly is the courses offered.

04:15:33.500 --> 04:15:41.666
There was a question of sample courses listed versus courses that we will actually offer at the high school levels, which begins approximately four years from now with 35 students in ninth grade.

04:15:42.567 --> 04:15:47.611
As we get closer to the launching of our high school portion of our model, and as we know the needs of our children, we are serving better.

04:15:48.473 --> 04:15:52.115
and better, we will have developed a full complement of courses in our course catalog.

04:15:52.616 --> 04:15:56.418
This will include intervention courses, elective courses based on student need and interest.

04:15:56.999 --> 04:16:09.067
In the handout provided to you, in that middle tab, we gave four different examples, samples of what a high school matriculation for different types of students, different students, different classifications would look like.

04:16:09.767 --> 04:16:11.289
And we appreciate the clarifying questions.

04:16:12.350 --> 04:16:16.296
And we did not include a sample schedule in the body of our petition.

04:16:16.836 --> 04:16:18.118
So you have that there.

04:16:18.999 --> 04:16:27.911
I'd also like to point out that after leading high schools for the past seven years, this is the norm when it comes to determining which courses you must offer your students based on need and interest.

04:16:30.788 --> 04:16:37.612
Lastly, in closing, Promise Academy is essentially an innovative, research-based elementary school that will grow slowly into a world-class high school.

04:16:38.212 --> 04:16:48.638
We aim to prepare students in San Jose, downtown San Jose in particular, our most vulnerable, low-income children of color, to attend college, be innovators, and social entrepreneurs who are prepared to change the world.

04:16:49.358 --> 04:16:57.623
On behalf of the more than 300 parents in downtown San Jose who are supporting our school, I passionately ask you vote to approve Promise Academy.

04:16:58.304 --> 04:17:02.526
And with your support, we'll be able to address a local need and accomplish our goal for our children.

04:17:03.007 --> 04:17:03.247
Thank you.

04:17:05.388 --> 04:17:06.149
Okay, thank you.

04:17:06.709 --> 04:17:09.951
Now, 10 minutes for the opponents of the petition.

04:17:21.670 --> 04:17:22.290
Good afternoon.

04:17:22.930 --> 04:17:24.030
My name is Christelle Johnson.

04:17:24.090 --> 04:17:27.531
I'm the Director for Charter Schools for the Santa Clara County Office of Education.

04:17:27.551 --> 04:17:32.012
I'd like to provide you with a brief background that led to this decision.

04:17:32.272 --> 04:17:41.714
On July 11, 2017, the Charter Schools Office of the Santa Clara County Office of Education received a petition for a district appeal charter school from the Promise Academy team.

04:17:42.294 --> 04:17:47.875
Promise Academy sought approval to establish and operate a public charter school for grades TK through 12.

04:17:48.655 --> 04:17:52.938
for one year of planning plus an additional five years serving students through June of 2023.

04:17:54.459 --> 04:18:00.764
SCCOE complied with all applicable timeline requirements established by California Ed Code 47605B.

04:18:01.304 --> 04:18:03.266
A public hearing was held on July 19, 2017.

04:18:05.416 --> 04:18:13.481
SACOE charter staff analyzed the petition following California Ed Code and the board's guidelines regarding consideration of district appeal charters.

04:18:13.841 --> 04:18:19.165
The analysis was based on the review of the petition supported by information gathered also in the capacity interview.

04:18:19.885 --> 04:18:25.709
In reviewing a petition for approval of a charter on appeal from a district denial, Ed Code states that California

04:18:26.269 --> 04:18:44.036
excuse me, that the County Board of Education shall grant a charter of the petition in the school under this part if it is satisfied that granting the charter is consistent with sound educational practice and further specifies that a charter petition may only be denied if the County Board makes written factual findings specific to the particular charter supporting one or more

04:18:44.776 --> 04:18:46.618
of six reasons for denial of a charter.

04:18:46.998 --> 04:19:08.478
Unsound educational program, petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program, required number of signatures, affirmation of each of the conditions, reasonably comprehensive descriptions of the required elements, and a declaration that the charter school shall be exclusive public employer for employees of the charter school for purposes for educational employment relations.

04:19:09.179 --> 04:19:15.762
On September 6, 2017, a decision hearing was held on promise and staff findings were presented to SEC BOE.

04:19:16.442 --> 04:19:21.644
Staff found that the petition met requirements for required signatures, affirmations, and exclusive public employer.

04:19:21.724 --> 04:19:30.688
Staff also found that the petitions demonstrated the capacity to successfully implement the program if the board allowed the following deficiencies to be corrected in the petition.

04:19:31.408 --> 04:19:44.038
Staff concluded that the petition did not meet sound educational program with major elements including but not limited to graduation requirements, appropriate credentialing, and educational practices for English learners.

04:19:44.619 --> 04:19:52.265
Staff also indicated that the petition had additional gaps in fulfilling the recently comprehensive descriptions which require refining and editing

04:19:52.765 --> 04:19:54.527
if the board were to approve the petitioners.

04:19:55.347 --> 04:20:14.604
Although the staff found that the petition offered a program which may benefit students in TK-12 grade school educational system, several deficiencies and issues including the educational program, employee qualifications, the support and outreach for the ethnic and racial balance of the school, and other concerns detailed in the full staff analysis.

04:20:15.385 --> 04:20:24.734
The SCCOE board members took a motion on the decision hearing for promise which resulted in a three to three split vote and there was one member absent that evening.

04:20:25.215 --> 04:20:29.399
Based on the split motion the SCCOE board could not take action on this petition.

04:20:29.979 --> 04:20:33.683
This concludes the SCCOE summary for Promise Academy.

04:20:35.885 --> 04:20:39.746
Good afternoon, Stephen McMahon, I'm the Deputy Superintendent for the San Identified School District.

04:20:39.866 --> 04:20:48.368
I want to apologize in advance, some of this is going to be repetitive, but as a former mathematics teacher, you've got to teach period six with as much enthusiasm as you did period five.

04:20:49.469 --> 04:20:54.330
And when the audience changes, you've got to give that material like you're giving it the first time, right?

04:20:54.350 --> 04:20:57.551
So I know behind me, not everyone was here for presentation number one.

04:20:58.431 --> 04:21:00.512
I appreciate your patience hearing some of those things.

04:21:00.532 --> 04:21:08.556
We're going to do this in three parts, talk a little bit about who Santa's Unified is, give you some specific examples regarding this petition, and what we think should happen going forward.

04:21:09.317 --> 04:21:12.258
If you were to describe Santa's Unified in two words, it would be equity and quality.

04:21:13.039 --> 04:21:18.482
I don't know how many of you know this, but Santa's Unified was the first school district to adopt an A to G graduation system.

04:21:19.209 --> 04:21:21.971
But we didn't adopt it blind to the diverse needs of learners.

04:21:22.591 --> 04:21:26.874
There was always backup, supports, and other pathways to make sure they could get their high school diploma.

04:21:27.334 --> 04:21:31.077
But we were the leaders in going A to G, and it's been an incredible success over the years.

04:21:32.117 --> 04:21:32.578
Quality.

04:21:33.038 --> 04:21:35.600
Our teacher evaluation system is recognized throughout the nation.

04:21:35.640 --> 04:21:37.921
You can Google it right now and find a lot of positive articles.

04:21:38.361 --> 04:21:39.862
It's easy to say a teacher's great.

04:21:40.623 --> 04:21:41.624
We don't accept that anymore.

04:21:42.224 --> 04:21:45.046
If there's no evidence to support the claim, the claim is irrelevant.

04:21:45.706 --> 04:21:47.047
This teacher needs to be dismissed.

04:21:47.468 --> 04:21:50.250
If there's no evidence to support the claim, the claim is irrelevant.

04:21:50.650 --> 04:21:53.733
I really appreciate Board Member Williams citing data.

04:21:54.053 --> 04:21:54.834
We love evidence.

04:21:55.394 --> 04:21:56.595
Keep searching for that data.

04:21:56.615 --> 04:22:06.984
You'll find that Santa's Unified exceeds the statewide averages in almost every category including the subgroups and is competitive in a very not as diverse county as we are as a school district.

04:22:07.384 --> 04:22:10.487
So we're proud of our data and we're proud of the growth we have to achieve.

04:22:10.987 --> 04:22:15.070
Throughout this presentation and discussion of this petition, I hope you balance claims and evidence.

04:22:15.510 --> 04:22:16.831
It's easy to say something.

04:22:17.251 --> 04:22:18.452
It's much harder to validate it.

04:22:18.492 --> 04:22:23.195
And I know your work is challenging to validate claims, but please hold us accountable the entire time.

04:22:25.379 --> 04:22:27.340
County of Santa Clara, 32 LEAs.

04:22:28.221 --> 04:22:31.323
We are a charter leader, as evidenced by the 84 approvals.

04:22:32.183 --> 04:22:36.526
It is rare that a charter petition comes before this body from Santa Clara County.

04:22:37.307 --> 04:22:38.948
If it's coming here, there are reasons.

04:22:39.468 --> 04:22:43.611
There is evidence for why it didn't pass the school district and the county office.

04:22:45.117 --> 04:22:48.119
The city of San Jose is a subset of Santa Clara County.

04:22:48.840 --> 04:22:50.801
There are 19 school districts within our city.

04:22:51.581 --> 04:22:56.425
You heard earlier, not everyone, lots of references to San Jose.

04:22:57.565 --> 04:23:00.187
Most of the times they were not San Jose Unified schools.

04:23:00.788 --> 04:23:05.251
We take a lot of pride if it's a San Jose Unified issue and address it immediately because we expect quality.

04:23:05.911 --> 04:23:12.777
We appreciate knowing the distinction between San Jose Unified and our other partners in Santa Clara County and the city of San Jose.

04:23:13.197 --> 04:23:18.121
I hope you do the same because we are very proud of the work we do and very accountable for it.

04:23:18.181 --> 04:23:20.723
If we've made a mistake, we want to know it's our school so we can fix it.

04:23:21.403 --> 04:23:25.146
If it's not our school, we'd love to go to the neighboring district and give them some best practices.

04:23:26.027 --> 04:23:28.789
There are 65 charter schools approved in our city.

04:23:28.869 --> 04:23:30.611
Parents have a lot of choice and opportunity.

04:23:31.960 --> 04:23:34.781
Within our school districts, 10 charter schools are open.

04:23:35.081 --> 04:23:42.962
With your initial authorizer for five of them, two of them were approved on county appeals, and three of them were directly submitted to the county countywide.

04:23:43.642 --> 04:23:47.623
We were the first charter authorizer in Santa Clara County, Downtown College Prep High School.

04:23:48.003 --> 04:23:49.744
We authorized the first charter school in our county.

04:23:49.784 --> 04:23:55.625
We opened our doors, we created them as a partner, they're still serving students, they've expanded to other districts, added middle school options.

04:23:56.145 --> 04:23:57.665
We are open to high quality charters.

04:23:58.225 --> 04:24:00.566
I had a photo of a bus driver in the earlier slide,

04:24:01.326 --> 04:24:03.547
We are committed to choice for families.

04:24:03.987 --> 04:24:10.531
We maintain an extensive transportation network so you can get through our banana and parents have options for all 41 schools.

04:24:11.411 --> 04:24:12.492
We take a lot of pride in that.

04:24:13.372 --> 04:24:19.115
I love hearing charter petitioners say they're going to serve all students and then looking for the evidence in the budget of transportation costs.

04:24:20.580 --> 04:24:22.021
And when it's never there, I know.

04:24:22.041 --> 04:24:24.762
High needs special ed kid, not going to that school.

04:24:25.663 --> 04:24:27.624
Someone from far away, not going to that school.

04:24:28.084 --> 04:24:30.565
If you don't pay for transportation, you're not open to every family.

04:24:31.146 --> 04:24:38.189
Santa's Unified invests millions of dollars every school year to make sure our families have choice and can travel throughout our district to the schools they want to go to.

04:24:39.410 --> 04:24:40.671
Let's talk about some other claims.

04:24:41.727 --> 04:24:43.349
innovative partnership with the Tech Museum.

04:24:43.810 --> 04:24:44.610
It's in the petition.

04:24:45.331 --> 04:24:49.616
You can look right now on page 47 for this statement.

04:24:49.997 --> 04:24:51.058
We call the Tech Museum.

04:24:51.539 --> 04:24:52.380
There's no MOU.

04:24:52.900 --> 04:24:53.981
There's no approved agreement.

04:24:54.322 --> 04:24:57.746
There is nothing in writing to signify a formal partnership in existence.

04:24:58.367 --> 04:24:59.268
But we have some evidence.

04:25:00.589 --> 04:25:02.570
That's Tim Ritchie, CEO of the Tech.

04:25:03.290 --> 04:25:06.151
That's Maria Evans, principal of our elementary school.

04:25:06.791 --> 04:25:13.152
And that's First Lady Michelle Obama, receiving an award for the Tech Museum's excellent work in the sciences.

04:25:13.773 --> 04:25:14.813
Why is our principal there?

04:25:15.053 --> 04:25:18.654
Because we have a long-standing, real partnership with the Tech Museum of Innovation.

04:25:19.386 --> 04:25:24.988
Maria Evans was invited by Tim Retchie to attend this ceremony and receive the award because of a long-lasting community partnership.

04:25:26.049 --> 04:25:32.772
The partnership exists not only at Washington Elementary, but at Burnett Middle School and several other schools throughout Santa Clara County.

04:25:33.192 --> 04:25:33.932
It is nothing new.

04:25:34.372 --> 04:25:37.794
Parents already have the choice and the option to get a tech-supported school.

04:25:38.874 --> 04:25:40.255
Unsound educational practice.

04:25:41.055 --> 04:25:44.777
Local review, county review, state review all found the petition to be unsound.

04:25:46.809 --> 04:25:48.590
Graduation requirements are a common theme.

04:25:49.351 --> 04:25:52.813
You can look at a videotape at the Santa Clara County Office of Education public hearing.

04:25:53.313 --> 04:25:58.657
The petitioner says, in response to a board member's question, why are these graduation requirements set this way?

04:25:59.597 --> 04:26:00.318
The parents met.

04:26:00.518 --> 04:26:01.118
They debated it.

04:26:01.398 --> 04:26:02.319
It was the parent's choice.

04:26:02.899 --> 04:26:04.520
These are the requirements the parents wanted.

04:26:04.961 --> 04:26:05.981
We totally respect that.

04:26:06.562 --> 04:26:09.043
Parents should be able to advocate for what they want.

04:26:09.404 --> 04:26:12.546
But as public servants, sometimes we have an obligation to say no.

04:26:13.266 --> 04:26:15.968
You can't advocate for a school that doesn't serve students with special needs.

04:26:16.588 --> 04:26:19.129
You can't advocate for a school that only serves Caucasian students.

04:26:20.170 --> 04:26:23.171
You can only advocate for schools that serve all students.

04:26:23.611 --> 04:26:33.136
And graduation requirements that would not allow a long-term English language learner to graduate or a student with disabilities to graduate, that's not something the state board, the county office, or the school district could allow.

04:26:35.168 --> 04:26:36.789
There's a clear process for this.

04:26:37.529 --> 04:26:40.370
You've got the petition with the graduation requirements stated.

04:26:40.590 --> 04:26:43.611
And at all three levels, they're found to be inappropriate.

04:26:44.352 --> 04:26:49.954
You're reviewing the petition you got per your own implementing regulations and California Education Code.

04:26:50.494 --> 04:26:54.556
If you change the graduation requirements this meeting, you should go back to the families who requested them.

04:26:55.316 --> 04:26:56.057
They asked for them.

04:26:56.417 --> 04:26:59.118
If they need to be different, the families have a right to have that discussion.

04:27:00.287 --> 04:27:02.869
There are millions of people in California that count on you.

04:27:04.049 --> 04:27:05.530
Sometime laws are unfriendly.

04:27:06.491 --> 04:27:10.374
They're not fair to everybody, but they keep our society and our democracy strong.

04:27:11.334 --> 04:27:13.235
This statement is from your own staff.

04:27:13.496 --> 04:27:14.336
This is your team.

04:27:15.017 --> 04:27:17.738
The petition is not consistent with sound educational practice.

04:27:18.459 --> 04:27:23.462
It will likely not benefit students who attend, including students with disabilities.

04:27:24.143 --> 04:27:28.686
Millions of citizens count on you to make sure schools like this do not open.

04:27:29.466 --> 04:27:30.487
You have the findings.

04:27:30.967 --> 04:27:32.148
You have the law behind you.

04:27:32.568 --> 04:27:37.212
It's your responsibility to take the vote to protect the citizens of California that are not here today.

04:27:37.792 --> 04:27:40.334
As I offered before, the entire team from Standards Unified is here.

04:27:40.795 --> 04:27:41.675
Ask us for the evidence.

04:27:41.835 --> 04:27:42.596
We're ready to provide it.

04:27:45.658 --> 04:27:47.980
OK, we're now ready for public comment.

04:27:54.571 --> 04:27:56.572
Would the following speakers please line up?

04:27:57.053 --> 04:28:21.630
Claudia Rossi, Brian Wheatley, Melissa Urbane, Joanna Latz, Grace Ma, Joseph DeSalvo, Claire Crawford, Peter Ortiz, Brian Greenberg, Brett Bymaster, Stephanie Palmieri, Marla Marcello, Juan Torres, Yana Duran, Araceli Serrano, Silvia Valdez,

04:28:27.975 --> 04:28:41.522
Valdovinos, Victoria Cuenca, Noe Guzman, Monica Vasquez, Vera Sloan, Robin Hyde, Adelita Gomez, Tanita Palminter, and Martha Herrera.

04:28:41.682 --> 04:28:43.503
I'll call other names momentarily.

04:28:45.284 --> 04:28:45.964
Please come forward.

04:28:49.517 --> 04:28:50.257
Good afternoon.

04:28:50.877 --> 04:28:52.738
My name is Claudia Rossi.

04:28:52.758 --> 04:28:58.960
I was one of the trustees that voted to not approve this appeal.

04:28:59.220 --> 04:29:04.122
And I'll share with you, I have a concern about this petition in particular.

04:29:04.142 --> 04:29:06.083
I took a day off from work.

04:29:06.503 --> 04:29:08.584
I ran for my children to get a ride.

04:29:09.164 --> 04:29:11.965
I went through a lot to be here and this is what concerns me.

04:29:12.905 --> 04:29:37.350
If you approve a school that does not have a strong support system for students who will be required to apply to four four-year colleges and also to take AP courses without the supports in place, that your vote today will mean that students will not get the support they need to fulfill this requirement to get their diploma.

04:29:37.730 --> 04:29:39.070
What will you say to them then?

04:29:39.690 --> 04:29:54.542
that you let the school proceed with this requirement for them to get their diploma when you didn't take the advice of local and county staff that urged us to not approve.

04:29:54.783 --> 04:30:01.148
They are promising students something they cannot support for them to accomplish.

04:30:01.208 --> 04:30:06.372
I urge you to please, please think of the children who will not get that high school diploma.

04:30:06.653 --> 04:30:06.993
Thank you.

04:30:14.147 --> 04:30:15.068
Hi there, once again.

04:30:15.328 --> 04:30:16.169
I'm Melissa Urban.

04:30:16.689 --> 04:30:21.413
I'm an ELD teacher and resident in San Jose Unified, downtown resident.

04:30:22.654 --> 04:30:28.819
Once again, I bring you concerns about the lack of an ELD program in this position.

04:30:29.539 --> 04:30:36.545
As you know, state and national best practices require dedicated ELD time, and that program is just not here.

04:30:37.265 --> 04:30:46.139
In downtown, about more than 60% of our students are ELs, and that's just not serving the population that's in our community.

04:30:48.222 --> 04:30:49.785
Promise doesn't support all students.

04:30:49.965 --> 04:30:51.006
I urge you to reject this.

04:30:51.307 --> 04:30:51.627
Thank you.

04:30:57.284 --> 04:31:07.410
Hello I am Grace Ma on the Santa Clara County School Board and I am one of the three school board members who voted to approve the appeal for promise on a split vote.

04:31:08.971 --> 04:31:20.219
I gave you all the academic performance areas of that downtown San Jose area and once again you can see that there is not a lot of choices for these families in the downtown area.

04:31:21.380 --> 04:31:27.246
Specifically, this school will have high expectations and that is something that this downtown area really needs.

04:31:27.647 --> 04:31:40.301
The high expectations, rigorous academics and a track record with someone as qualified as Dr. Johnson who has done turnarounds, who is experienced with English language learners, experienced with low SES areas.

04:31:42.063 --> 04:31:54.249
The community and local groups have met in multiple action meetings of hundreds of families and parents to talk about and design the school.

04:31:54.569 --> 04:31:59.912
They have put in countless hours designing a school that really fits their needs.

04:31:59.952 --> 04:32:03.734
So from a local control area they are definitely in the right place.

04:32:04.175 --> 04:32:04.655
Please approve.

04:32:09.198 --> 04:32:12.859
President Kirst, Superintendent Torlakson, members of the State Board of Education.

04:32:13.380 --> 04:32:19.462
I'm Joseph DeSalvo, a trustee on the County Board of Education, Santa Clara County Board of Education, and I voted for Promise Academy.

04:32:20.062 --> 04:32:21.163
Sacramento, we have a problem.

04:32:21.863 --> 04:32:29.966
Our children of color and low SES are hurting, and the village elders and leaders must find the solution sets to eliminate the racial achievement and expectation gap.

04:32:30.406 --> 04:32:31.426
Today, not tomorrow.

04:32:31.987 --> 04:32:35.208
I represent Santa's Unified School District on the County Board of Education.

04:32:36.138 --> 04:32:43.225
I do believe in my heart San Jose Unified School District works tirelessly as a district to address the aforementioned problem.

04:32:44.166 --> 04:32:54.155
Yet it is my considered belief that the achievement and expectation gap needs an all hands on deck practice with limited public dollars to meaningfully address the problem.

04:32:54.773 --> 04:33:01.996
Board member Williams was right on target with the citation of the data ascribed to Latinos in San Jose Unified School District with the last petition.

04:33:02.557 --> 04:33:06.218
The racial achievement and graduation gap is truly not a gap but a gulf.

04:33:06.739 --> 04:33:07.619
It must end.

04:33:08.780 --> 04:33:16.503
Promise Academy should be approved today to be a small puzzle piece to the solution set of the elimination of the gulf.

04:33:16.904 --> 04:33:17.584
Thank you very much.

04:33:22.585 --> 04:33:23.125
Hello again.

04:33:23.165 --> 04:33:24.126
My name is Johanna Latz.

04:33:24.166 --> 04:33:27.149
I'm a special education teacher in San Jose Unified School District.

04:33:27.229 --> 04:33:29.831
I'm also a resident in the district.

04:33:30.852 --> 04:33:35.716
There's a problem with Promise again for not addressing the needs of special education students.

04:33:35.756 --> 04:33:40.440
Special education students don't necessarily graduate and go to a four-year college.

04:33:40.940 --> 04:33:41.540
Some of them

04:33:42.902 --> 04:33:51.489
that graduate need maybe a two-year college or they need a skills-based transition into skills for life.

04:33:52.910 --> 04:34:01.216
Promise Academy does not address multiple or differently abilitied children that are graduating as they get older.

04:34:01.497 --> 04:34:01.757
Thank you.

04:34:05.117 --> 04:34:06.197
Hi, good afternoon again.

04:34:06.237 --> 04:34:10.039
My name is Stephanie Palmieri-Furrias, and I'm the principal of Washington Elementary.

04:34:10.059 --> 04:34:11.239
I'm not the one in the picture.

04:34:11.659 --> 04:34:13.160
I took over after she retired.

04:34:13.220 --> 04:34:14.780
I didn't get to go with Michelle Obama.

04:34:15.521 --> 04:34:20.282
But we continue to have a longstanding partnership with the Tech Museum.

04:34:20.322 --> 04:34:21.423
We are a tech academy.

04:34:21.443 --> 04:34:27.365
We're in our third year of the partnership, in which we are building capacity in our teachers to provide our students

04:34:27.745 --> 04:34:35.151
with the opportunities for engineering design challenges on a regular basis and also with basic coding skills.

04:34:35.811 --> 04:34:40.855
We have an engineering club and we have a lot of, we do a lot of work with the Tech Museum.

04:34:41.315 --> 04:34:50.862
I'd also like to speak a little bit about what I've seen happen when we get students who have come from charter schools that we're not able to provide the support needed for students with special needs.

04:34:51.263 --> 04:34:55.266
In fact, oftentimes, and I know I'm not speaking directly of this charter, but what I've seen

04:34:55.926 --> 04:35:00.808
is that I get a student and the parent comes to me and said, we were told that you will better be able to serve our student.

04:35:01.188 --> 04:35:13.492
We have parents coming with letters already written, and it is complex to be able to provide a student with special needs, all of the services they need, and I am concerned about this petition because of that reason.

04:35:13.772 --> 04:35:14.112
Thank you.

04:35:17.972 --> 04:35:20.495
Hi, it's Claire Crawford with In the Public Interest once again.

04:35:20.695 --> 04:35:32.088
And just a reminder of the numbers that I cited before, in our analysis, the State Board of Ed has approved 71% of the charters that have made it up here that have been denied at every local level.

04:35:32.829 --> 04:35:38.756
And just to give a few examples of the schools that have not succeeded after SBE approval,

04:35:39.757 --> 04:35:42.539
and some of the warning signs that I would really encourage you to look at today.

04:35:43.320 --> 04:36:00.736
In the example of celerity, although the state board did revoke or deny the charters, or I'm sorry, approved charters with warning signs from LACO, identifying inadequate knowledge of the law as one of the problems with the petitions, they went ahead and approved them.

04:36:00.816 --> 04:36:04.980
Now there's two schools that exist when the charters have had to be revoked.

04:36:05.860 --> 04:36:09.063
for two other schools due to massive corruption, fraud, et cetera.

04:36:10.243 --> 04:36:20.311
One of the ancillary effects of that was that the Walton Family Foundation asked for money back from the two existing scolarity schools based on what was happening in the rest of the network.

04:36:21.031 --> 04:36:28.537
I just want to mention Synergy also because the board was given notification of all the problems that ended up happening and that school was also shut down.

04:36:34.750 --> 04:36:38.171
My name is Adelita Gomez and I currently live in the downtown San Jose area.

04:36:38.391 --> 04:36:40.252
I have two children ages four and nine.

04:36:40.752 --> 04:36:50.455
My son currently attends a downtown San Jose Unified Elementary School and previously I had him in a charter school in the same area and I believe that Promise Academy is what is best for my children.

04:36:51.195 --> 04:36:53.416
I'm neither pro-charter school nor pro-district school.

04:36:53.476 --> 04:36:55.297
I'm pro-good schools and pro-family choice.

04:36:56.797 --> 04:37:02.439
I'm looking for a better option to be available in the downtown area than is currently being offered by my local school district.

04:37:02.939 --> 04:37:15.403
Promise is the option I choose for the family-like support system they offer that we're already experiencing the high expectations of AP courses or college courses and the help that they're going to provide to pay for those associated courses.

04:37:16.763 --> 04:37:23.868
I hope that this board will continue working towards giving families like mine more school choices because promise is a choice I will make for both of my children.

04:37:24.248 --> 04:37:33.373
This is your chance to help a lot of students that are gonna age out of this program if it's not approved right away since there's a limit on the grade level that's gonna be opened.

04:37:33.934 --> 04:37:39.057
There's many families that will be affected if this is not approved soon so I hope you take that into consideration.

04:37:40.398 --> 04:37:40.718
Thank you.

04:37:43.618 --> 04:37:45.901
Would the following people please line up to speak?

04:37:46.561 --> 04:38:01.378
Julie Shakin, Dean Elias, Ramon Lopez, Yolanda Bernal, Carol Montelongo, Molly Castillo, Eva Heredia, Heriberto Soto, Marlene Gomez, Ken Burt,

04:38:04.130 --> 04:38:16.194
Conn Russo representing Mayor Sam Liccardo, Linda Alvarez, Jesse Rodriguez, Deva Say, Tech Lemarian, Liz Guillen, and Colin Miller.

04:38:22.281 --> 04:38:24.263
Hello, my name is Tanita Palaman.

04:38:24.443 --> 04:38:29.647
I am a first generation Thai-American from Edmond, Oklahoma, and a single parent of two kids, five and 10.

04:38:30.227 --> 04:38:34.691
I went to an elementary school that used small group strategies like Promise Academy will be using.

04:38:35.071 --> 04:38:38.674
I went to a high school that provided AP classes and paid for those who took the class.

04:38:39.254 --> 04:38:42.397
That's what I'm looking for for my kids, but I don't have good options.

04:38:42.477 --> 04:38:46.000
I work two jobs and can't even afford a room in a school district with high ratings.

04:38:48.436 --> 04:38:50.257
My daughter, Natara, loves technology.

04:38:50.978 --> 04:38:56.001
Once a more difficult curriculum, she's excited about the challenges that Promise Academy will offer her.

04:38:57.202 --> 04:39:01.025
Promise Academy is a unique school that has a partnership with the Tech Museum.

04:39:02.406 --> 04:39:07.048
My son, Irvin, loves to build, use technology, learned a little bit of coding recently, and loved it.

04:39:07.508 --> 04:39:10.569
He does better in small group learning that Promise Academy won't offer.

04:39:11.070 --> 04:39:13.831
There have been concerns about the graduation requirements are too high.

04:39:14.611 --> 04:39:15.791
We know our kids can do it.

04:39:16.052 --> 04:39:17.672
I do not want the standards lowered.

04:39:17.852 --> 04:39:20.073
I want all our kids to be prepared for college.

04:39:20.573 --> 04:39:23.595
We know what is best for our kids, and we would be able to decide.

04:39:23.755 --> 04:39:24.695
We want Promise Academy.

04:39:24.715 --> 04:39:25.736
We ask for your approval.

04:39:25.756 --> 04:39:31.318
Are you translating for us?

04:39:33.516 --> 04:39:36.097
Muy buenas tardes a cada uno de ustedes.

04:39:37.178 --> 04:39:42.160
Yo soy Martha Herrera, madre de siete hijos y abuela de 18 nietos.

04:39:42.880 --> 04:39:49.663
No puedo creer que tenga que estar aquí con ustedes peleando en el mismo sistema que peleé en 1987.

04:39:49.803 --> 04:39:51.784
Y aquí tengo la prueba.

04:39:56.199 --> 04:40:10.011
I'm Martha Herrera, mother of seven and grandmother of 18.

04:40:10.131 --> 04:40:16.597
I can't believe that I'm here with you fighting for the same system that I fought in 1987, and she has proof.

04:40:17.237 --> 04:40:23.283
I want a better education for my children and the community, which is not occurring right now in downtown San Jose.

04:40:24.619 --> 04:40:35.189
For me, for my children, in the district they were in, they told me that they wouldn't finish high school because of their special needs.

04:40:35.889 --> 04:40:41.034
I personally enrolled each one of them in the university, and I told them,

04:40:45.859 --> 04:40:51.184
For my seven children, the district told me that they would not finish high school because of their learning disabilities.

04:40:51.705 --> 04:40:58.452
I personally helped every single one of them enroll in college and told them that from here on out, it was up to them to choose their own path.

04:40:59.893 --> 04:41:06.560
Esto es creer y preparar a cada estudiante sin o con necesidades especiales.

04:41:06.980 --> 04:41:13.287
Yo sé que esto es lo que promete, lo de PROMIS va a proveer a la comunidad en San Jose.

04:41:14.147 --> 04:41:19.853
This is what's called believing and preparing every child with or without a learning disability.

04:41:20.194 --> 04:41:23.577
I know that this is what PROMIS is going to provide in the San Jose community.

04:41:24.369 --> 04:41:29.697
And I support education for all children so they can raise to a higher level.

04:41:29.717 --> 04:41:30.058
Thank you.

04:41:40.956 --> 04:41:41.516
Good afternoon.

04:41:41.576 --> 04:41:44.078
My name is Brian Greenberg from the Silicon Schools Fund.

04:41:44.519 --> 04:41:46.320
We cleared up the financial questions earlier.

04:41:46.360 --> 04:41:49.042
I won't bother you with the exact same presentation.

04:41:49.062 --> 04:41:54.325
In fact, I have prepared remarks, and I'm just planning on saying something sort of from the heart to you all.

04:41:54.565 --> 04:41:56.807
In 2004, I came in front of the State Board as a petitioner.

04:41:57.347 --> 04:42:01.110
I was attempting to open the first charter school in the city of Hayward, which had never had a charter before.

04:42:01.130 --> 04:42:06.454
And I heard many of the same critiques as I've been hearing today for both of the previous petitions.

04:42:07.094 --> 04:42:22.908
And the state board had the wisdom to give our charter organization a chance, and we went on to open Leadership Public Schools Hayward, which has since gone on to be one of the highest rated charter schools in the state of California, so much so that the district five years later on renewal said, we'd like to approve you now, and we repaired what had been a damaged relationship.

04:42:23.428 --> 04:42:25.750
I'm hopeful that that same story can be said today.

04:42:26.571 --> 04:42:28.932
I planned on talking to you about the quality of the petitioner.

04:42:29.292 --> 04:42:32.193
I think you heard from his presentation his track record of success.

04:42:32.513 --> 04:42:41.636
The reason why we invested in this particular charter and this organization has some of the most authentic and deep parent engagement I have ever seen in my work supporting charter schools.

04:42:41.957 --> 04:42:47.659
And we have utter faith that this is demonstrably likely to succeed and to be somebody we would be proud to be associated with.

04:42:48.199 --> 04:42:48.459
Thank you.

04:42:54.199 --> 04:42:55.600
Hi, my name is Julie Chekim.

04:42:55.800 --> 04:42:57.301
I'm a refugee from Cambodia.

04:42:57.582 --> 04:43:03.486
I learned that my seventh grade math class in California was at a lower level than the fourth grade math in my refugee camp.

04:43:03.966 --> 04:43:10.050
My son, Adi, who is four years, wants to go to Promise Academy so he can go to the Tech Museum all the time.

04:43:10.591 --> 04:43:13.793
He loves challenges, and I want a school that will challenge him.

04:43:14.233 --> 04:43:21.479
Too many kids that drop out of school or join gangs and get into drugs are really smart kids that were bored and weren't engaged or challenged.

04:43:22.199 --> 04:43:28.405
Our downtown schools with ratings threes and fours have been doing a disservice to our kids in our community for over 20 years.

04:43:29.006 --> 04:43:30.387
We need that change now.

04:43:30.548 --> 04:43:37.555
We want Promise Academy because it's a tech school that will prepare our students for college and compete for better jobs in Silicon Valley.

04:43:38.195 --> 04:43:40.936
I hear concerns about high school graduation requirement.

04:43:41.276 --> 04:43:50.080
I am not concerned because our parent groups have been working with Dr. Johnson to design this school since day one and we want to have high expectations for our kids.

04:43:50.601 --> 04:44:00.125
We know that intent is to serve all kids and that school will accommodate students in various circumstances to graduate like refugee and English learner students alike.

04:44:00.225 --> 04:44:00.545
Thank you.

04:44:07.022 --> 04:44:08.483
Good afternoon, I'm Dean Elias.

04:44:10.083 --> 04:44:15.265
I feel honored to meet with you and I'm privileged to represent the Promise Academy Board.

04:44:15.285 --> 04:44:18.186
I have two points I want to make about the proposal.

04:44:19.046 --> 04:44:25.948
First, it is simply a brilliant design to serve low-income and marginalized students in downtown San Jose.

04:44:26.729 --> 04:44:32.431
It's based on Dr. Johnson's nationally acclaimed work on behalf of such students in Merced.

04:44:33.651 --> 04:44:35.692
Second, it's intended to be a proof point

04:44:36.412 --> 04:44:42.414
to demonstrate that we can educate all students in downtown San Jose successfully.

04:44:43.374 --> 04:44:48.996
Critics have focused on specific features such as the graduation requirements or the graduation goals.

04:44:49.716 --> 04:44:53.957
The specific complaints ignore the power of the overall design.

04:44:54.678 --> 04:44:56.178
Please don't be distracted.

04:44:56.858 --> 04:45:05.501
Please pay attention to the brilliance of the design of the school's design to serve low-income and marginalized students and approve the proposal.

04:45:05.741 --> 04:45:06.041
Thank you.

04:45:11.690 --> 04:45:13.992
Hello, my name is Magdalena Castillo.

04:45:14.652 --> 04:45:20.216
I have a five-year-old son, Cesar, and a 10-year-old nephew, Zion, who has special needs.

04:45:20.997 --> 04:45:23.859
And I know that Promise Academy is made to serve my family.

04:45:24.780 --> 04:45:27.902
I grew up in downtown San Jose, and I've lived there all my life.

04:45:28.583 --> 04:45:30.304
I attended traditional public schools.

04:45:30.704 --> 04:45:32.045
I graduated from high school.

04:45:32.546 --> 04:45:35.988
I'm prepared for college, and it took me six years to get an AA degree.

04:45:36.929 --> 04:45:39.392
due to time spent in remedial courses.

04:45:40.173 --> 04:45:41.134
It's time for change.

04:45:41.534 --> 04:45:46.099
High expectations is why I want Promise Academy for my son.

04:45:46.739 --> 04:45:48.701
I want high expectations to be what he knows.

04:45:49.422 --> 04:45:55.228
The fact is that two district schools in our area are in the orange on the state dashboard.

04:45:55.849 --> 04:45:59.413
They are not setting kids like my son and my nephew up for success.

04:46:00.573 --> 04:46:05.795
Through this whole process, I have heard that our kids can't meet the school's graduation requirements.

04:46:06.015 --> 04:46:06.756
I don't believe that.

04:46:07.296 --> 04:46:08.296
I know our kids can do it.

04:46:09.237 --> 04:46:11.457
There is a huge demand for this school in our community.

04:46:12.098 --> 04:46:15.239
We want Promise Academy in our downtown San Jose for our kids.

04:46:15.359 --> 04:46:15.659
Thank you.

04:46:20.831 --> 04:46:25.294
Good afternoon, my name is Yolanda Bernal-Somano, and I was born and raised in downtown San Jose.

04:46:25.974 --> 04:46:30.938
I am a long-time downtown resident, first-generation college student, and the daughter of immigrants.

04:46:31.518 --> 04:46:40.404
I now have two sons, and it makes me sad to see the schools in my neighborhood, some that I attended myself 25 years ago, are still failing.

04:46:41.105 --> 04:46:50.030
Just to be clear, my three home schools, my three choices, are Title I schools, rated three or fours out of 10 on review websites, and orange on the state dashboard.

04:46:51.011 --> 04:46:54.033
That's why I've been working hard to open Promise in my neighborhood.

04:46:54.874 --> 04:46:58.317
Throughout our entire process, we've had a collaborative spirit with the district.

04:46:58.697 --> 04:47:09.585
We've invited board members and district staff to research meeting, community action forums where over 100 families attended to demand action on the achievement gap that exists in our school downtown.

04:47:10.746 --> 04:47:17.690
Some of us taken up on our offer and others have just simply stated, we cannot dictate to you what we want you to put in your petition.

04:47:18.290 --> 04:47:20.492
To be clear, we're not looking for pre-approval.

04:47:20.592 --> 04:47:24.834
We're open for open dialogue, communication, and a working relationship.

04:47:26.075 --> 04:47:35.000
Throughout our approval process, the district has used unfair processes, and we've included two San Jose Mercury News articles that have been given to you in the handouts.

04:47:35.220 --> 04:47:35.520
Thank you.

04:47:41.001 --> 04:47:42.662
Hello, my name is Ramon, father of one.

04:47:43.163 --> 04:47:45.344
I was part of the downtown traditional public school system.

04:47:45.485 --> 04:47:46.766
I never knew the importance of college.

04:47:46.786 --> 04:47:48.847
I felt that I was just livestock, just another lumber.

04:47:49.108 --> 04:47:50.989
As long as I graduate, that's all that mattered.

04:47:51.369 --> 04:47:54.011
I'd like to support slash knowledge from my teachers and family.

04:47:54.352 --> 04:47:56.053
Will the parents share Promise Academy's vision?

04:47:56.113 --> 04:47:58.495
Promise's parent dedication will have brought me to their doorstep.

04:47:58.835 --> 04:48:05.801
Promise demonstrates and emphasizes how important it is to place our children's future before anything and being constantly involved in our children's academic endeavors.

04:48:06.121 --> 04:48:07.122
to ensure their success.

04:48:07.562 --> 04:48:10.203
Every student has potential, but a strong support system is vital.

04:48:10.604 --> 04:48:20.930
I promise the effort from our children, parents, teachers, hard work gives them better odds that if they're one of the 1,000 Latino high school district graduates who don't even have the option to apply to a four-year university, if they graduate at all.

04:48:21.390 --> 04:48:26.253
I promise I would be satisfied and a confident parent of my sons and every student's higher educational achievements.

04:48:26.673 --> 04:48:31.902
I want my son to be passionate about his education and strive for greatness with the tools to tackle rigorous academic challenges.

04:48:32.403 --> 04:48:38.212
I believe Promise Academies can ensure that my son graduates and is prepared for college and ready for what life throws at him.

04:48:38.513 --> 04:48:39.675
Thank you and please approve.

04:48:46.598 --> 04:48:49.320
Buenas tardes, mi nombre es Eveleria y tengo dos hijas.

04:48:49.720 --> 04:48:54.242
Y soy una latina que llegue a este país casi 20 años, pensando en mi sueño americano.

04:48:54.742 --> 04:48:57.704
Pero sobrevivir en San Jose es cada día más difícil.

04:48:57.924 --> 04:49:08.050
He estado involucrada con PROMES más de un año y he estado en cada junta, en cada taller, en todo el proceso para poder hacer preguntas y recibir respuestas.

04:49:08.570 --> 04:49:15.534
Yo quiero una escuela con PROMES en la cual seamos pocos como familia y nuestros hijos tengan tecnología junto al Tex Museo de San Jose.

04:49:16.471 --> 04:49:18.472
My name is Eva Heredia and I have two daughters.

04:49:18.632 --> 04:49:25.415
I'm Latina and I came to this country 20 years ago thinking about my American dream, but surviving in San Jose, California every day is difficult.

04:49:25.775 --> 04:49:32.738
I've been involved with Promise Academy for more than a year and attended every meeting and training to understand and be able to ask my questions.

04:49:33.058 --> 04:49:40.781
I want schools like Promise in which we are few and like family, our children can have technology in conjunction with the San Jose Tech Museum.

04:49:41.505 --> 04:49:47.494
Durante el proceso me sentido discriminada por las opciones para progresar como latinos aquí son mínimas.

04:49:48.095 --> 04:49:56.567
En mi experiencia propia trabajo todo el día y queriendo superarme voy a la high school de adultos por las noches y es triste ver la clase llena de jóvenes.

04:49:57.228 --> 04:50:03.592
Sus estadísticas me enseñan que hay dos posibilidades para mis hijas.

04:50:04.072 --> 04:50:12.317
Ellas pueden tomar sus chances y ser una de mil graduadas ahorita sin ninguna probabilidad de ir a la universidad de cuatro años en el distrito.

04:50:12.937 --> 04:50:21.983
Mil cuatrocientos latinos seniors o pueden ser latinas graduadas y preparadas de parte de 35 al año que se gradúan en Promise.

04:50:22.863 --> 04:50:27.229
During this process, I felt discriminated because the option to progress as a Latina are minimum.

04:50:27.569 --> 04:50:31.914
In my own experience, I work all day to better myself and I attend adult high school at night.

04:50:32.475 --> 04:50:34.537
It's sad to see the classes filled with young people.

04:50:34.917 --> 04:50:37.721
Your statistics shows me that there are two possibilities for my daughter.

04:50:38.101 --> 04:50:47.730
They can take their chances and be one of 1,000 students right now that are not graduating with the possibility to go to a university in a district of 1,400 Latino high school students.

04:50:48.130 --> 04:50:52.894
Or they can be a Latina graduate and prepared as a part of a 35 a year that will graduate from Promise.

04:51:09.198 --> 04:51:10.899
Hello, my name is Carol Montelongo.

04:51:10.919 --> 04:51:13.101
I'm a founding parent leader with Promise Academy.

04:51:13.661 --> 04:51:18.705
I was an ESL student that was not supported in the traditional public schools of San Jose.

04:51:19.285 --> 04:51:26.450
When I think about the public schools in my neighborhood, I worry that they may not give my son the best chance to succeed as a low-income student of color.

04:51:26.710 --> 04:51:28.791
I want an innovative school model for my son.

04:51:29.012 --> 04:51:33.975
This process has allowed us parents to be the leaders in the school design process and in the political realm.

04:51:35.868 --> 04:51:38.711
This is the way charters should be created through community.

04:51:38.751 --> 04:51:44.696
There's a true partnership that Promise Academy has cultivated with families, and the demand for this school is big.

04:51:44.776 --> 04:51:48.219
Over 300 families, we are already working as a team.

04:51:48.960 --> 04:51:55.545
I already feel a strong, trusting relationship with Dr. Johnson, and I know that communication between the school and families is valued.

04:51:55.766 --> 04:52:02.772
This type of engagement is what will push my child and all children to succeed and achieve Promise's graduation requirements.

04:52:04.625 --> 04:52:07.406
These requirements symbolize our hopes and dreams for a better future.

04:52:08.166 --> 04:52:14.749
PROMIS offers the support to achieve higher education, innovative model of 35 students in a grade that's unheard of.

04:52:14.849 --> 04:52:17.390
That's how we will support all our students as a community.

04:52:17.670 --> 04:52:18.071
Thank you.

04:52:24.573 --> 04:52:25.454
Buenas tardes, board.

04:52:25.534 --> 04:52:26.914
Mi nombre es Heriberto Soto.

04:52:29.115 --> 04:52:30.876
Gracias por la oportunidad de hablar con ustedes.

04:52:31.772 --> 04:52:37.897
Cuando yo vi que uno de mis hijos estaba atrasado académicamente, tuve que rápidamente buscar mejores opciones.

04:52:38.898 --> 04:52:48.165
Si yo hubiera tenido, si yo no hubiera tenido la opción a las escuelas rigurosas, entonces mis hijos no estarían en la universidad de cuatro años el día de hoy.

04:52:48.565 --> 04:52:58.773
En realidad, es que las escuelas rigurosas que están probando, empujando y poniendo presión en los estudiantes latinos para alcanzar el sueño universitario lo están logrando.

04:53:00.305 --> 04:53:01.846
Hello, my name is Eriberto Soto.

04:53:01.966 --> 04:53:06.389
When I saw one of my children was behind academically, I quickly had to find better options.

04:53:06.910 --> 04:53:11.653
If I had not had the option to rigorous schools, then my children wouldn't be in four-year universities today.

04:53:12.253 --> 04:53:20.719
We are living the reality that rigorous schools are testing, pushing, and putting pressure on Latino students to reach their university dream, and they are succeeding.

04:53:23.615 --> 04:53:30.723
Queremos darles a nuestros hijos una preparación que les permita vivir, trabajar en un mundo tecnológico y moderno.

04:53:32.104 --> 04:53:36.389
Escuelas como Promise Academy deben existir en nuestra comunidad.

04:53:36.409 --> 04:53:38.452
Nuestros hijos tienen la capacidad mental

04:53:39.284 --> 04:53:44.950
para poder recibir cualquier tipo de enseñanza, pero ustedes la tienen que permitir.

04:53:45.531 --> 04:53:53.400
Por favor, les pedimos que nos ayuden para salir adelante, que sean ustedes parte de la solución a nuestros problemas.

04:53:55.037 --> 04:54:00.842
We want to give our children the preparation that will allow them to live and work in the technological modern world.

04:54:01.283 --> 04:54:03.785
Schools like Promise Academy should exist in our community.

04:54:04.726 --> 04:54:09.370
Our children have the mental capacity to receive whatever type of teaching, but you have to allow it.

04:54:09.691 --> 04:54:14.475
Please, we ask that you help us move forward and that you can be a part of the solution to our problems.

04:54:14.575 --> 04:54:14.876
Thank you.

04:54:15.496 --> 04:54:19.020
Si no hubiera la necesidad que tenemos en nuestra comunidad, no estaríamos aquí.

04:54:19.180 --> 04:54:22.084
Nosotros estamos buscando más, no nomás la high school.

04:54:22.644 --> 04:54:23.886
Queremos ir más adelante.

04:54:24.246 --> 04:54:25.087
Tenemos sueños.

04:54:25.207 --> 04:54:25.528
Gracias.

04:54:30.646 --> 04:54:32.127
Hello, my name is Jesse Rodriguez.

04:54:32.147 --> 04:54:33.448
I'm a parent in San Jose.

04:54:33.668 --> 04:54:39.952
I believe that I am and we are my son in fourth grade is a charter success story.

04:54:40.593 --> 04:54:42.374
He's doing trigonometry right now.

04:54:42.394 --> 04:54:44.695
I never did trigonometry till I got in high school.

04:54:44.736 --> 04:54:45.516
He's in fourth grade.

04:54:45.536 --> 04:54:46.697
They were coding last year.

04:54:47.237 --> 04:54:51.278
I believe the charter school system is good for our kids and our community.

04:54:51.618 --> 04:54:57.239
Dr. Anthony has built a village that I want to be a part of because it takes a village to raise a child.

04:54:57.720 --> 04:55:03.121
Parents can't do it by themselves, teachers can't do it by themselves, and the students definitely can't do it by themselves.

04:55:03.581 --> 04:55:06.942
They need all of us, including y'all, to approve this school.

04:55:07.422 --> 04:55:08.062
Thank you very much.

04:55:17.478 --> 04:55:20.339
Ken Bird on behalf of the California Teachers Association.

04:55:21.160 --> 04:55:27.783
One minute's not enough and I'd like an extension, but if I don't, I want to talk about the local control issue.

04:55:28.343 --> 04:55:38.448
Because the comment you made, Board Member Ortiz-Lacombe, I think the problem with your analysis is, yes, you're here to hear appeals, but what is the standard of the appeal?

04:55:39.008 --> 04:55:41.709
The local district and the county know the grounds.

04:55:42.298 --> 04:55:44.219
They know the witness credibility.

04:55:44.279 --> 04:55:45.380
They've reviewed the matter.

04:55:45.800 --> 04:55:47.701
They come in and say something is red.

04:55:48.221 --> 04:55:50.162
Then the department says it's blue.

04:55:51.062 --> 04:55:53.524
And woo, you have a de novo hearing.

04:55:53.564 --> 04:55:55.044
You start all over again.

04:55:55.605 --> 04:55:57.445
That's not the way it ought to be done.

04:55:58.066 --> 04:56:02.508
Like in a court of review that doesn't appeal, the trial court

04:56:03.149 --> 04:56:07.792
ultimately knows and is closest to the fact, the credibility, the witness.

04:56:08.352 --> 04:56:28.525
The point has been about local control and may have to be legislation, is that absent clear error, when San Jose Unified School District comes in and says it's red, and obviously you look at it and they could have reasonably interpreted it's red, you ought to say it's red.

04:56:28.545 --> 04:56:30.286
That's up to your judgment.

04:56:30.987 --> 04:56:31.327
Thank you.

04:56:50.029 --> 04:56:50.489
Good afternoon.

04:56:51.489 --> 04:56:55.990
Linda Albers, a parent of three boys, 12, 10, and 7, and a lifelong resident of San Jose.

04:56:56.330 --> 04:57:00.991
I've experienced firsthand the flawed educational system that does not meet the needs of our community.

04:57:01.111 --> 04:57:09.193
I'm a first-generation graduate of San Jose State University, and I have fought tooth and nail facing so much injustice and adversity striving for higher education.

04:57:09.513 --> 04:57:16.355
It took me many, many years, more than I should have, to earn a bachelor's degree because I was not adequately prepared.

04:57:17.635 --> 04:57:25.478
I, like all the parents here, want nothing more than our children to thrive in this community, and I don't want my children to go through what I went through for an education.

04:57:26.599 --> 04:57:32.781
This school and its curriculum is exactly what will work for my children, and I will not lower the standards for receiving world-class education.

04:57:34.241 --> 04:57:40.446
And I am making a well-educated decision in choosing Promise because it was designed to serve kids like mine.

04:57:40.827 --> 04:57:46.311
It's a shame to see the injustice still present today in the district's process for approving this school.

04:57:46.832 --> 04:57:52.576
My boys have dreams of becoming engineers and please don't shatter their dreams of becoming the innovators of tomorrow.

04:57:52.837 --> 04:57:53.918
Please vote yes for Promise.

04:58:00.123 --> 04:58:00.243
Hi.

04:58:00.928 --> 04:58:01.168
Hello.

04:58:01.268 --> 04:58:03.029
Hi, my name is Deva Saitak Lamariam.

04:58:03.250 --> 04:58:05.731
I grew up in San Jose and attended San Jose Unified.

04:58:06.251 --> 04:58:09.934
My experience as a student of color was not very good.

04:58:10.314 --> 04:58:14.717
I feel that I was marginalized and did not get much support from the regular public school to succeed.

04:58:15.277 --> 04:58:19.400
I currently have two kids in elementary school attending San Jose Unified.

04:58:19.700 --> 04:58:24.663
I want to give my kids a better opportunity than I had by sending them to a high-performing school in my area.

04:58:25.103 --> 04:58:37.878
Currently, San Jose School District, San Jose Unified School District, two-third of Latino and over half, again, half of African-American graduates from high school do not qualify to attend a four-year college.

04:58:38.178 --> 04:58:40.761
I will not allow my kids to be part of this statistic.

04:58:41.301 --> 04:58:45.124
Promise Academy has a great small group instructional model that I believe in.

04:58:45.504 --> 04:58:47.766
From the beginning, I have been helping design Promise.

04:58:48.146 --> 04:58:50.207
The school is here to help this undisturbed community.

04:58:50.547 --> 04:58:55.070
We need more high performing options for our kids now.

04:58:55.411 --> 04:58:59.613
We will not continue to wait again, generation after generation, for better schools.

04:59:00.514 --> 04:59:01.835
This district has failed me.

04:59:02.195 --> 04:59:04.337
I will not let it fail my kids.

04:59:04.737 --> 04:59:05.497
Equality again.

04:59:05.798 --> 04:59:09.900
Two-thirds of Latinos and over half African-Americans don't graduate to go to college.

04:59:10.281 --> 04:59:10.601
Thank you.

04:59:11.101 --> 04:59:12.083
of Approved Problems Academy.

04:59:17.291 --> 04:59:19.315
Would the following four people please line up?

04:59:19.535 --> 04:59:24.183
Patrick Bernhardt, Gemma Ables, Richard Hansberger, and Ona Keller.

04:59:24.383 --> 04:59:24.684
Thank you.

04:59:31.018 --> 04:59:34.723
Hello, my name is Marlene Martinez and I'm here supporting Promise Academy.

04:59:34.963 --> 04:59:39.430
I have lived in San Jose for over 30 years and have seen it grow along with the cost of living.

04:59:39.970 --> 04:59:44.336
My grandson goes to school in San Jose Unified and I'm very concerned.

04:59:44.537 --> 04:59:46.479
My granddaughter is close to school age.

04:59:47.080 --> 04:59:51.484
The two of them need a better opportunity to take the next step into higher education.

04:59:52.104 --> 04:59:58.549
I have been incredibly frustrated with how San Jose Unified has acted in this process with Promise Academy.

04:59:59.150 --> 05:00:07.356
San Jose Unified tried to prevent us from having a fair hearing by falsely disqualifying signatures we had gathered, even though we had over 300.

05:00:08.457 --> 05:00:20.423
In the ACCS hearing last month, San Jose Unified publicly admitted that they refused to meet with charter petitioners after they submitted a petition or give them a chance to resolve any issues.

05:00:20.943 --> 05:00:22.904
This is what happened with Dr. Johnson.

05:00:23.304 --> 05:00:27.966
They have not shown any evidence in this process for actually wanting to work with us.

05:00:28.567 --> 05:00:34.909
All we are asking is for the same opportunity that others have for high quality education for our families.

05:00:35.430 --> 05:00:37.391
Please approve of this academy.

05:00:37.691 --> 05:00:37.991
Thank you.

05:00:42.386 --> 05:00:44.870
Good afternoon, President Kirsch and members of the board.

05:00:44.990 --> 05:00:46.131
My name is Khan Russo.

05:00:46.572 --> 05:00:49.456
I'm here on behalf of Mayor Sam Liccardo of the city of San Jose.

05:00:49.476 --> 05:00:54.263
I'm his director of strategic partnerships and performance and direct his education strategy.

05:00:54.283 --> 05:00:58.048
I would like to share highlights from a letter that mayor has sent you.

05:00:58.729 --> 05:01:05.195
Dear President Kish and members of the board, I write to you in support of Promise Academy in San Jose Unified School District.

05:01:05.615 --> 05:01:13.823
Considering the significant benefits that Promise Academy will bring to our students in downtown San Jose, I hope you will vote in favor in support of this charter.

05:01:14.423 --> 05:01:18.027
I understand the difficulties of families struggling to survive financially.

05:01:18.488 --> 05:01:24.735
Unfortunately, this financial burden most significantly impacts our children, their academic performance, and their future.

05:01:25.195 --> 05:01:31.002
Downtown San Jose students have been failing behind academically for years, especially Latino students.

05:01:31.482 --> 05:01:32.784
Currently, only 35%, so this is 65%

05:01:34.946 --> 05:01:39.068
percent of kids graduate from downtown San Jose schools eligible for college.

05:01:39.268 --> 05:01:40.429
Sixty-five do not.

05:01:40.889 --> 05:01:47.572
This is an urgent issue, particularly in Silicon Valley, where we have a responsibility to prepare the next generation of entrepreneurs.

05:01:48.352 --> 05:01:53.335
And I just want to emphasize, choosing one is not about not choosing the other.

05:01:53.675 --> 05:01:58.517
We have such a high demand for tech-oriented schools in Silicon Valley that the more, the merrier.

05:02:03.340 --> 05:02:05.703
Good afternoon, Liz Guillen with Public Advocates.

05:02:07.045 --> 05:02:14.954
We oppose the appeal and support the department's recommendation.

05:02:16.356 --> 05:02:21.882
We believe that the graduation requirements place impermissible conditions on a high school diploma.

05:02:22.603 --> 05:02:38.116
These are high stakes requirements and they could have discriminatory impact on students, low performing students who are likely to be students of color, English learners, homeless and foster youth, students with disabilities and immigrant students.

05:02:39.963 --> 05:02:53.496
Your job is to pay attention to the petition and the charter, what's written, not what's being said to people in this room so that you can be sure that you're protecting the rights of people who are not in this room.

05:02:53.717 --> 05:02:54.177
Thank you.

05:02:58.642 --> 05:02:59.162
Good afternoon.

05:02:59.202 --> 05:03:01.464
Colin Miller with the California Charter Schools Association.

05:03:02.560 --> 05:03:15.326
I've been doing this work for a long time, and I haven't, don't always come across groups that have the passion, the experience, knowledge, and the clarity of mission that this organization and their leadership has.

05:03:15.346 --> 05:03:18.487
I speak from the heart on that point.

05:03:20.728 --> 05:03:27.751
It is, with all the excellent schools that we have in the state, the promise of this school is exceptional.

05:03:29.192 --> 05:03:31.173
So I would just leave you with that.

05:03:31.193 --> 05:03:38.319
I think I would look forward to the day that we're having a real conversation about having too many excellent schools in our state.

05:03:39.560 --> 05:03:41.281
Maybe this school will help us get on that path.

05:03:41.602 --> 05:03:41.842
Thank you.

05:03:44.787 --> 05:03:47.671
Good afternoon, Patrick Bernhardt, President of the Santa Zeta Teachers Association.

05:03:47.711 --> 05:03:57.244
There is much among the Promise founding community that is laudable, but SJTA opposes Promise's petition, principally because of the graduation requirements.

05:03:57.264 --> 05:04:00.349
We submit that they are actively discriminatory against students whose

05:04:00.749 --> 05:04:13.014
and learning disabilities make it impossible for them to achieve, but perhaps more importantly, they are passively discriminatory against students who might believe themselves incapable of meeting those graduation requirements.

05:04:13.095 --> 05:04:20.878
Students like Dr. Johnson in high school, who said that he only began to see himself as capable of meeting those requirements when

05:04:21.218 --> 05:04:25.361
when an employee of the school changed his schedule and enrolled him in those AP courses.

05:04:25.401 --> 05:04:32.906
By hanging a sign on the door that says, all students are going to graduate for AP classes, only students who believe themselves capable of that will enter the school.

05:04:33.367 --> 05:04:37.850
And the response is that there's a long runway to help them achieve that goal.

05:04:37.870 --> 05:04:42.573
But in downtown San Jose, with a 33% mobility rate, there isn't really a long runway.

05:04:42.993 --> 05:04:47.957
Eight of the students in a class of 24 will be gone by the end of the year, and they'll be replaced by eight new students.

05:04:48.537 --> 05:04:50.379
That's the demographics of our city.

05:04:50.439 --> 05:04:50.739
Thank you.

05:04:57.366 --> 05:04:57.886
Good afternoon.

05:04:57.946 --> 05:04:58.867
My name is Gemma Ables.

05:04:58.927 --> 05:05:06.309
I'm the president of the Morgan Health Federation of Teachers and a vice president of both the South Bay Labor Council and the California Federation of Teachers.

05:05:06.729 --> 05:05:09.430
But most importantly, I'm a longtime resident of San Jose.

05:05:10.070 --> 05:05:14.772
Promise Academy is brought to you by parents, but really it's brought to you by Innovate Public Schools.

05:05:15.392 --> 05:05:18.813
Innovate has helped charter schools gain a market share in Santa Clara County.

05:05:19.434 --> 05:05:25.916
Framing charters in this model, a business model, helps companies like Innovate provide a common ground when they look for corporate funders.

05:05:26.636 --> 05:05:32.158
In this model, your staff and the other staff's analysis of a petition is a risk management analysis.

05:05:32.838 --> 05:05:42.301
In this case, the staff on all levels, which has the expertise in all areas of school academics and operations, has determined that the risk is high.

05:05:43.121 --> 05:05:52.567
Some board members, including several at the county board level, are willing to take a risk on some charter schools, even when their own staff find a petition deficient.

05:05:53.027 --> 05:05:58.650
They do this as part of a business model saying the school will close if parents are not satisfied.

05:05:59.051 --> 05:06:04.414
They're willing to risk not just operations of a school, but a disruption in the education of students at that school.

05:06:04.554 --> 05:06:04.854
Thank you.

05:06:09.485 --> 05:06:10.506
Good afternoon, members of the board.

05:06:10.546 --> 05:06:11.806
My name is Richard Hansberger.

05:06:11.826 --> 05:06:16.049
I'm a partner with the law firm Hansberger & Kline, and we're proud to represent Promise Public Schools.

05:06:16.109 --> 05:06:28.375
I'm here to talk to you today and just kind of deal with the elephant in the room because you've heard some very interesting allegations that somehow this school is going to either be actively or passively discriminatory against students with special needs or 504 plans or EL students.

05:06:30.416 --> 05:06:35.700
In as much as these graduation requirements present an insurmountable obstacle, nothing could be further from the truth.

05:06:36.100 --> 05:06:44.565
This team in its capacity, who I have come to know over the past two years, is dedicated to serving children of all sizes, shapes, and varieties.

05:06:45.006 --> 05:06:51.150
There is no intent to discriminate against kids or deny them alternative graduation requirements.

05:06:51.490 --> 05:06:59.035
And I'd urge you to see beyond that and understand that this school and its founder and its entire team is dedicated to that principle.

05:06:59.515 --> 05:07:05.861
Finally, I would just urge you to look behind me at the community support that's so clearly evident in this room and the capacity of these leaders.

05:07:06.361 --> 05:07:11.906
And that kind of explains, I think, why there was a one vote denial at the district level and a split vote at the county.

05:07:11.926 --> 05:07:14.728
There's a lot of promise here, and no pun intended.

05:07:14.768 --> 05:07:15.489
I urge you to see it.

05:07:15.950 --> 05:07:16.250
Thank you.

05:07:20.632 --> 05:07:22.492
Ona Keller, California Teachers Association.

05:07:22.612 --> 05:07:26.193
I'd like to address the petitioner's plan for high school education.

05:07:26.273 --> 05:07:30.394
They're going to be providing in their petition supposedly a large number of different classes.

05:07:31.134 --> 05:07:41.537
But given the small number of students and the limited staffing plan, the school would need to recruit multiple teachers who also have multiple single subject credentials in order to offer the plan that they want to offer.

05:07:42.238 --> 05:07:51.211
Given the teaching shortage that we're having right now, especially in science and math, I don't see how they're going to be able to recruit those teachers, especially since they're also not offering STRS.

05:07:51.792 --> 05:07:53.314
The other issue is around discrimination.

05:07:53.354 --> 05:07:57.180
We've talked about the graduation requirements, but we haven't talked about the discipline policies.

05:07:58.220 --> 05:08:03.661
Promise says that a disruption of school activities or willful defiance can result in suspension or expulsion.

05:08:04.061 --> 05:08:11.522
This has historically had a discriminatory impact on students of color, and it's why it's not permissible to expel students in non-charter schools for these actions.

05:08:11.982 --> 05:08:22.724
The family handbook also allows discipline for such misbehavior as falling asleep in class or not having materials, even though these actions may not be attributable to misbehavior, but rather challenging circumstances such as homelessness.

05:08:23.924 --> 05:08:25.465
They don't warrant discipline but our support.

05:08:25.605 --> 05:08:26.965
Please deny this petition, thank you.

05:08:31.494 --> 05:08:33.275
Eric Premack, Charter Schools Development Center.

05:08:33.316 --> 05:08:36.158
We support the granting of this appeal.

05:08:38.259 --> 05:08:48.187
This one as well, we again have a concern that the inappropriately high standards or different standards are being applied to this relative to what's required in law.

05:08:48.688 --> 05:08:50.249
Again, we see the cash.

05:08:51.609 --> 05:08:54.390
in advance requirement being applied.

05:08:54.470 --> 05:09:00.051
We see other requirements about high school course graduation requirements being applied in kind of weird ways.

05:09:00.111 --> 05:09:03.512
On the one hand, they get criticized for not having enough P.E.

05:09:04.052 --> 05:09:09.393
On the other hand, they get criticized for setting too high of a bar with respect to A.P.

05:09:09.913 --> 05:09:11.113
With respect to the P.E.

05:09:11.193 --> 05:09:14.094
class, those laws do not apply to charter schools.

05:09:14.114 --> 05:09:20.355
They're not subject to the same graduation requirements that govern traditional public schools and have some flexibility in that area.

05:09:21.070 --> 05:09:29.795
And with respect to AP, while it is arguably excessive ambition, I think we've got bigger problems than that to worry about.

05:09:29.855 --> 05:09:38.180
And we have worked with a number of schools that target at-risk populations and have very stiff AP requirements like these.

05:09:38.440 --> 05:09:38.760
Thank you.

05:09:41.081 --> 05:09:43.543
Okay, that concludes the public comment.

05:09:43.583 --> 05:09:47.845
Therefore, I close the public hearing and we're ready for board discussion.

05:09:47.865 --> 05:09:49.126
Board member Holliday.

05:09:50.467 --> 05:09:50.848
Thank you.

05:09:51.468 --> 05:09:56.794
First of all, once again, thanks to everyone who made the long trip here and and made all the effort to be here.

05:09:57.635 --> 05:10:02.179
I'd first like to mention something to Deputy Superintendent McMahon.

05:10:04.782 --> 05:10:10.709
We have this board has listened to many district presentations over the years.

05:10:11.609 --> 05:10:14.050
And yours is about the best I've ever heard.

05:10:15.931 --> 05:10:19.712
It was detailed and full and heartfelt.

05:10:20.012 --> 05:10:26.974
And I thank you for your comments, even though just a few moments ago, you probably didn't agree with my vote very much.

05:10:27.874 --> 05:10:29.655
I do want you to understand.

05:10:29.675 --> 05:10:38.858
I think it's worth taking a moment to speak to the district and county and say that

05:10:39.884 --> 05:11:03.554
Despite some of the things that are said in this room that seem to be negative or hurtful toward the district or the county or to a charter, this board, I know, and myself in particular, have the highest respect for the work that your district is doing, the highest respect for the effort that you're making, your teachers are making.

05:11:03.934 --> 05:11:07.155
And I know that your heart is always in the right place.

05:11:07.335 --> 05:11:09.436
And I'm grateful that you do the work you do.

05:11:13.424 --> 05:11:26.677
Okay, on that I'd like to ask the first question which is we've heard a lot about San Jose and I've seen some data about San Jose Unified compared to the charter schools that are there.

05:11:26.757 --> 05:11:31.762
So I'd like to ask if the curriculum people could present some of that so that we could

05:11:33.266 --> 05:11:34.668
In San Jose Unified.

05:11:34.728 --> 05:11:44.800
Yeah, I think we can talk about single comparisons, but maybe we could get a broader picture of how they do perform.

05:11:45.253 --> 05:11:45.593
Thank you.

05:11:45.814 --> 05:11:48.256
Again, I'm Jackie Zell, Associate Superintendent.

05:11:48.296 --> 05:11:52.781
This is Emily McGinnis, Director of Technology Data Services.

05:11:53.762 --> 05:12:02.913
In San Jose, Emily will give you some very specific comparable data that is all publicly reported, but in San Jose Unified, I do want to point out we've had an AP push

05:12:03.693 --> 05:12:05.876
initiative in our district for about five years now.

05:12:06.296 --> 05:12:11.983
We are district-wide at 55% of every subgroup taking at least one AP or IB course.

05:12:12.744 --> 05:12:21.534
We pay for every single course for every single student except for $5 and we pay for the SAT and the PSAT for every single student.

05:12:21.974 --> 05:12:30.520
So we have very, as Deputy Superintendent McMahon said earlier, we're the first district in the state of California to go ADG graduation rates.

05:12:31.060 --> 05:12:33.162
Our graduation rates are very high.

05:12:33.362 --> 05:12:37.304
Overall graduation rates are very high, including our Latino graduation rate.

05:12:37.344 --> 05:12:40.086
There's still a gap, but it's closed considerably.

05:12:40.627 --> 05:12:46.430
Our ADG rates have been going up over the last four years in all subgroups, especially our Latino girls.

05:12:46.871 --> 05:12:49.252
So we have been making great strides in this area.

05:12:49.653 --> 05:12:51.734
I'll let Emily go ahead and talk about some

05:12:51.914 --> 05:12:52.094
data.

05:12:52.895 --> 05:12:58.941
Good afternoon my name is Emily McGinnis and as Jackie Zeller pointed out I am the director of technology and data services for San Jose Unified.

05:12:59.482 --> 05:13:02.525
I'm also a product of San Jose Unified's downtown schools.

05:13:03.106 --> 05:13:06.789
My children this fall will attend San Jose Unified downtown schools.

05:13:06.990 --> 05:13:09.572
I am very committed to the work of San Jose Unified.

05:13:10.533 --> 05:13:17.535
As we heard the conversation around data today, I wanted to take a moment and share just a few points that I think are relevant to this conversation.

05:13:18.115 --> 05:13:29.578
When we look at performance within San Jose Unified on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments, we do see that San Jose Unified in 2017 did in fact outscore the state in both mathematics and English language arts.

05:13:30.359 --> 05:13:38.761
Interestingly, when we look at the performance of our district authorized charters, we see a very different picture of performance.

05:13:39.301 --> 05:13:49.684
I then took the time to look at the performance of the schools that we would expect the two applicants to draw from, the nine downtown elementary schools and the two middle schools.

05:13:50.284 --> 05:13:58.906
And what we saw is that across the board, with very few exceptions, these schools actually outscore our authorized charters.

05:13:59.726 --> 05:14:02.166
We recognize that we have a long way to go.

05:14:02.567 --> 05:14:05.987
We recognize that educating students is hard work.

05:14:06.127 --> 05:14:11.208
We recognize that educating students in the downtown setting in San Jose Unified is not easy by any means.

05:14:11.648 --> 05:14:20.590
But one might expect, given all that we've heard today, that authorized charters already supporting these students might be outperforming the district with these student groups.

05:14:20.710 --> 05:14:22.030
And they are not yet at this time.

05:14:22.070 --> 05:14:23.390
And I urge you to consider that.

05:14:23.850 --> 05:14:27.411
And I urge you to consider what you have heard today with regard to the work of San Jose Unified.

05:14:27.691 --> 05:14:27.951
Thank you.

05:14:29.548 --> 05:14:30.929
Any other board member questions?

05:14:31.029 --> 05:14:31.830
Ortiz-Lacombe.

05:14:33.491 --> 05:14:36.914
Go ahead.

05:14:36.954 --> 05:14:40.077
Primeramente le quiero agradecer a los padres que han venido hoy.

05:14:40.257 --> 05:14:45.601
Sabemos que vienen de San Jose, que tuvieron que viajar hacia acá.

05:14:45.621 --> 05:14:47.463
Les agradecemos su interés en esta escuela.

05:14:48.504 --> 05:14:54.689
I want to thank the parents who are here and of course everyone else, all the other stakeholders and the district folks.

05:14:56.388 --> 05:15:00.371
My questions with this charter are not necessarily with the leadership.

05:15:01.572 --> 05:15:04.475
I think that Dr. Johnson, you have a track record.

05:15:05.436 --> 05:15:07.397
I'm impressed by your presentation.

05:15:07.437 --> 05:15:09.039
I'm impressed by what I've read about you.

05:15:09.059 --> 05:15:19.127
I think that having great ambitious goals for students and in particular students who have been historically marginalized is amazing.

05:15:19.587 --> 05:15:22.370
The only thing more amazing is high outcomes, right?

05:15:23.150 --> 05:15:26.214
And we have to have difficult conversations here.

05:15:26.234 --> 05:15:30.779
None of us are sitting here with a rubber stamp ready to approve charter petitions.

05:15:30.799 --> 05:15:33.082
That may be the perception, but that is not the case.

05:15:33.122 --> 05:15:37.106
And you could roll the tape, because I always ask difficult questions of both sides.

05:15:39.068 --> 05:15:47.919
When we talk about high expectations for our students, and a lot of the parents said, queremos una buena educación, queremos una educación para nuestros hijos que vayan a la universidad.

05:15:48.339 --> 05:15:48.980
That is the goal.

05:15:49.040 --> 05:15:52.064
We want our students to go to college, to be college and career ready.

05:15:52.204 --> 05:15:54.166
That is the goal, I think, for everyone in this room.

05:15:54.847 --> 05:16:01.172
But there is so much to consider when we establish those goals.

05:16:01.772 --> 05:16:13.421
San Jose Unified, you were the first to establish the A through G curriculum or A through G requirement as your default curriculum, which was later modeled by LAUSD and several other districts.

05:16:14.302 --> 05:16:18.205
And we see that even when you have very high expectations,

05:16:19.105 --> 05:16:21.508
The devil's really in the implementation of that policy.

05:16:22.209 --> 05:16:30.079
So it's great that you have high expectations for your students, but I do have questions about graduation goals versus graduation requirements.

05:16:30.779 --> 05:16:37.387
I have questions about how we could execute those goals when you have an expected graduating class of 35 students.

05:16:38.942 --> 05:16:40.882
who will be very diverse.

05:16:40.902 --> 05:16:45.043
I know that you're hoping to grow your students, but that's just not reality.

05:16:45.323 --> 05:16:58.446
When you run a charter school, sometimes you start at elementary and you're adding a year, a grade level of year, and then you lose students, and then you have to fill those gaps, and you start recruiting at different points in that spectrum.

05:16:58.806 --> 05:17:03.808
And some of the students that you start recruiting in the later years may not be your homegrown students.

05:17:04.308 --> 05:17:05.568
So you have to now look at,

05:17:05.988 --> 05:17:06.689
school culture?

05:17:06.749 --> 05:17:08.209
How do you immerse them in this culture?

05:17:08.710 --> 05:17:12.112
How do you account for some of their academic underperformance?

05:17:12.472 --> 05:17:13.773
How do you bring them up to speed?

05:17:15.094 --> 05:17:21.397
And so I'm really concerned about that because having great goals and lofty expectations is amazing.

05:17:21.818 --> 05:17:33.285
But how do we then build a support with a school of your size to really accommodate and meet the needs of all students who will come through your doors at any given point in that continuum of K-12?

05:17:34.665 --> 05:17:38.906
So it would be great if we could get a little bit more clarification around your numbers.

05:17:39.467 --> 05:17:42.567
We're not here to change the graduation requirement.

05:17:42.928 --> 05:17:46.389
So explain a little bit about the grad goal versus a grad requirement.

05:17:47.009 --> 05:17:51.370
And then also there was a note here about EL students and LTELs.

05:17:51.670 --> 05:17:56.351
So if you could tell us how you work with your long-term ELs, your ELs, and students with disabilities.

05:17:56.791 --> 05:17:57.092
Thank you.

05:17:58.772 --> 05:17:59.692
Shut that down just so I can.

05:18:00.413 --> 05:18:01.933
There's a lot, so.

05:18:02.674 --> 05:18:17.987
Graduation goal versus graduation requirements, your size of the projected graduation class of 35, and how you really plan to have a tailored educational plan for each of your students, if you have 35 students, that is your graduating class.

05:18:18.247 --> 05:18:24.433
And then English learners, students with disabilities, and nail tails, long term.

05:18:31.155 --> 05:18:36.577
I mean, the real question is, how do we build support?

05:18:37.098 --> 05:18:42.480
And I do see having 35 graduates per year as an advantage as opposed to a disadvantage.

05:18:43.361 --> 05:18:46.262
When I was running large high schools, having

05:18:46.702 --> 05:18:52.368
over 300 graduates a year, it's very difficult to give kids individualized support and to monitor their progress.

05:18:52.468 --> 05:18:55.371
And I believe that systems of support are really important.

05:18:55.712 --> 05:19:01.998
I've always worked in environments where we've had transient populations and also transient staffs, so teachers coming in and out.

05:19:02.098 --> 05:19:08.025
And so to have a really, really structured model and an ingrained culture of how you're going to deliver high-quality instruction

05:19:08.485 --> 05:19:09.586
is really, really important.

05:19:09.867 --> 05:19:23.340
And when you have that, when you have the vast majority of your students and your teachers bringing on that critical mass or moving on and matriculating, then it's easier to absorb students who have specific needs or who are behind grade level as they come in because you have those supports in place.

05:19:24.381 --> 05:19:28.966
Some of the things that make our school unique, as I mentioned in my presentation, is our one-to-one weekly reflection.

05:19:29.446 --> 05:19:37.369
So, that one-to-one reflection where students sit down with a teacher and they go over their goals, they go over where they are, and they plan for the next week, that happens weekly.

05:19:37.629 --> 05:19:44.712
Typically, the feedback cycle at a traditional school, and sometimes even at charter schools, is quarterly.

05:19:45.012 --> 05:19:49.834
Sometimes you get a progress report in the middle, and that's too long to determine how you need to pivot.

05:19:50.714 --> 05:19:51.475
for a child.

05:19:51.795 --> 05:20:01.666
And so I think that's advantageous to a student who might be experiencing a transient life where they're moving in and out of schools is that we have our finger on the pulse of what that particular child needs.

05:20:02.367 --> 05:20:05.390
When it comes to EL students,

05:20:06.852 --> 05:20:10.274
So I mentioned I began my career as an English language development teacher.

05:20:10.434 --> 05:20:12.196
I was a department chair of English language development.

05:20:12.756 --> 05:20:23.223
And at the schools that I've served, at least a third of the student population has been or was EL at some part of their lives, their educational experience.

05:20:23.923 --> 05:20:24.644
And I would say

05:20:25.724 --> 05:20:30.906
First and foremost is a culture of inclusivity is is what you need I mean, you can't learn language without culture.

05:20:30.926 --> 05:20:43.750
And so as you bring students in making sure that they feel welcome Second is an intense focus and we list out several strategies in our petition of how we're going to address the needs of English learners I can cite the page again in just a second.

05:20:43.770 --> 05:20:47.331
I have it written down here, but but basically we want to have daily academic

05:20:48.511 --> 05:20:49.732
or language goals for students.

05:20:50.052 --> 05:20:52.773
And so they're not outside of a classroom, they're in the class.

05:20:52.934 --> 05:21:00.658
And what I found is great instruction for EL students and other students who have disabilities and other learning specific learning needs is great for all students.

05:21:01.058 --> 05:21:07.381
And so having a focus on academic vocabulary, having a focus on language acquisition goals.

05:21:08.042 --> 05:21:13.825
Also, we have a content workshop portion of our school day where it's completely differentiated.

05:21:14.185 --> 05:21:15.406
for every single student.

05:21:15.746 --> 05:21:21.068
And so you might have a group of students doing carpet time here who are your assault level ones.

05:21:21.628 --> 05:21:25.749
You might have a group of students over here doing carpet time who are on grade level.

05:21:26.069 --> 05:21:36.693
And so in a personalized learning environment, you're actually more able to give students exactly what they need as opposed to in a traditional setting as students are floating through teaching to the middle of the class.

05:21:36.753 --> 05:21:40.675
So that's the whole design of our school is to make sure that we're addressing the needs of EL students.

05:21:41.195 --> 05:21:47.278
When it comes to long-term EL students, this is a tough one.

05:21:47.318 --> 05:21:55.021
It's tough for any school principal to address when you have students who have maybe been labeled EL since they're in third grade and now they're in 10th grade.

05:21:55.521 --> 05:22:01.424
And when they speak to you, it doesn't seem that they have any type of language acquisition need.

05:22:01.884 --> 05:22:06.486
But you know about their CELP scores or the new ELPAC scores.

05:22:06.786 --> 05:22:09.167
I'm sorry, I was a CELP trainer from our previous district.

05:22:09.847 --> 05:22:13.371
Yeah, and so you see that they are, they have those needs.

05:22:13.511 --> 05:22:21.799
And so typically they're placed in a structured emerging class in addition to their other courses they're taking if they're in high school.

05:22:22.320 --> 05:22:23.361
And this is a bit different.

05:22:23.381 --> 05:22:26.264
We have office hours where students can get one-to-one guided reading.

05:22:26.644 --> 05:22:37.350
We have learning lab, learning studio, where students, when they're not in their core classes, we can assign them that learning studio to have them to develop their language skills.

05:22:38.091 --> 05:22:42.053
Ultimately, we have differentiation and structures in place and systems in place for those students.

05:22:43.776 --> 05:22:59.996
What I want to get at is the concern of the unintended consequence of raising the bar so high, unrealistically high, that we are now depriving a student who is a student that we initially wanted to serve from a high school diploma.

05:23:02.049 --> 05:23:17.777
If your graduation requirements are, you know, must be accepted to, maybe you could dispel that if that's not the case, must take an X amount number of AP courses and college honors and apply to university, a four-year university,

05:23:18.497 --> 05:23:38.751
If those, which I think are great, however, we know that others have attempted, and I don't know if you could point at a school with diverse student population that has been able to be successful with 100% of their students, but I'm concerned about those students who may not be able to meet that criteria.

05:23:39.091 --> 05:23:47.917
And instead of raising the bar for them and holding high expectations, because I believe all students can learn, but I also believe that we need to give them the supports so that they could achieve and learn.

05:23:48.437 --> 05:23:58.221
But there could be an unintended consequence that we are not graduating some students and it's the same students that we wanted to serve with this criteria to graduate.

05:23:58.502 --> 05:24:00.402
So if you could speak about that a little bit more.

05:24:01.003 --> 05:24:03.124
Is this the graduation requirement?

05:24:03.464 --> 05:24:04.444
Was this your goal?

05:24:04.584 --> 05:24:08.626
And you happen to put it on a piece of paper and everyone's like, what are you doing?

05:24:09.226 --> 05:24:10.167
If I could go back in time.

05:24:11.467 --> 05:24:14.349
and retitle the chart on page 82.

05:24:14.589 --> 05:24:16.991
I really think we wouldn't be here right now.

05:24:17.671 --> 05:24:20.273
And then also, it doesn't represent our intent.

05:24:20.493 --> 05:24:25.437
Our intent has always been to offer additional pathways to a successful graduation for all students.

05:24:26.497 --> 05:24:32.581
We don't make the connection explicitly, and definitely that's what I want to clarify right now, and we're willing to clarify in writing.

05:24:33.202 --> 05:24:40.747
But if a student comes into our school, especially later in their high school years, within extenuating circumstances, that student has a different plan.

05:24:41.307 --> 05:24:47.133
So, for example, a student who's on an IEP, that IEP dictates what courses are appropriate for them.

05:24:47.173 --> 05:24:47.994
The IEP team does.

05:24:48.935 --> 05:24:59.666
And in many cases, you make the decision in 10th or 11th grade, okay, this kid needs to be in more vocational courses with supports, but still as much as possible have them in mainstream courses.

05:25:00.067 --> 05:25:00.747
If a kid has a

05:25:01.948 --> 05:25:16.159
a mental or physical disability that doesn't qualify for an IEP and they're on a 504 plan, then again, that 504 plan is sensitive to what that dictates what the students need and what those graduation goals will become.

05:25:16.639 --> 05:25:20.562
The same is true for a long-term EL or an English learner, a newcomer who comes to your school.

05:25:21.103 --> 05:25:24.366
You do the best you can and you make sure that kid has a pathway to success.

05:25:24.446 --> 05:25:29.930
So in my experience, I've had kids who come in in the 10th grade, they're brilliant, they just have a language acquisition barrier.

05:25:30.411 --> 05:25:42.161
And so we were able to offer them an additional year, a fifth year, to make sure that they were prepared or find a transition into an adult program for them to make sure that they're able to

05:25:42.601 --> 05:25:43.242
complete that way.

05:25:43.342 --> 05:25:48.746
There are realities to being a high school principal that you have to deal with, and we have systems in place.

05:25:48.946 --> 05:25:55.270
We didn't explicitly align those with the graduation goals, but definitely that was our intent.

05:25:55.290 --> 05:25:58.493
Okay, other comments?

05:25:58.513 --> 05:25:59.753
Board Member Williams is next.

05:26:07.739 --> 05:26:17.602
I reviewed your petition, not in the way that a staff person would, but I looked at all the staff comments and went to the sections of the petition that the staff comments addressed.

05:26:18.342 --> 05:26:28.646
And I thought, and tell me if I misunderstood this, but I thought in addition to 504, in addition to IEP, that for students, that I read that for students who are struggling in any way,

05:26:29.626 --> 05:26:31.687
that they would get an individual learning plan.

05:26:32.207 --> 05:26:42.912
And that those, just like IEPs, even though it's not required by law, the individual learning plan would supersede the general graduation requirements as needed.

05:26:42.932 --> 05:26:45.273
Is that, did I read that correctly?

05:26:45.353 --> 05:26:47.834
You did read that correctly, and I'm sorry I forgot to mention this.

05:26:47.874 --> 05:26:56.599
But we also, in our tiers of intervention, at a basic level, we have student success teams that evaluate students who have extenuating circumstances.

05:26:57.039 --> 05:27:00.521
Maybe a student gets to their 12th grade year, and they have a death in the family.

05:27:01.062 --> 05:27:09.726
And they aren't able to fulfill all of those requirements that are above and beyond the California, what the CDE requires.

05:27:10.047 --> 05:27:13.088
Then that student success team takes that into consideration.

05:27:14.649 --> 05:27:27.241
I will say that, again, my track record has shown that this is not something that I would allow to happen if it comes to that for a student.

05:27:27.401 --> 05:27:35.349
We want to make sure that every student has a successful pathway and at a base level that student success team covers anything else that's not in a protected category.

05:27:40.224 --> 05:27:43.287
Well, I hadn't quite finished, so let her finish, then I'll finish.

05:27:43.467 --> 05:27:44.367
Yes, go ahead.

05:27:44.988 --> 05:27:45.789
I'm Amanda Gardner.

05:27:45.909 --> 05:27:54.856
I am the VP of Schools at Innovate Public Schools, and I've been working with Dr. Johnson and our families on the school design of this program for well over a year now.

05:27:55.897 --> 05:28:01.762
I, myself, was a principal of two, actually, high-performing schools, charter schools in Boston.

05:28:01.782 --> 05:28:03.283
I was the school leader for about 10 years.

05:28:04.044 --> 05:28:08.027
And the first school that I ran did serve a very diverse population.

05:28:08.067 --> 05:28:10.770
About 90 percent of our students were on free and reduced lunch.

05:28:11.991 --> 05:28:19.578
Over 25 percent of our students were on IEPs, including students with significant disabilities, intellectual impairments, that sort of thing.

05:28:20.178 --> 05:28:26.262
And 100% of our graduating seniors have gone on to four-year colleges and universities.

05:28:26.483 --> 05:28:28.964
And so I know that it's possible.

05:28:29.985 --> 05:28:33.247
I actually have a graduate from my school in the audience today.

05:28:33.267 --> 05:28:34.168
I think he's back there.

05:28:35.909 --> 05:28:38.870
I'm very proud of that, to get to work with him these days.

05:28:39.431 --> 05:28:46.674
But we know what's possible when we design a school from the ground up to meet the needs of all of our students.

05:28:46.754 --> 05:28:52.577
Now, that doesn't mean that there's going to be some serious extenuating circumstances that we need to take into consideration.

05:28:53.337 --> 05:29:11.216
But I think sometimes what gets lost in the conversation around these high expectations is that we need to lead with a mindset that the vast majority of our students have the potential to be successful in college and life, and that that's our default.

05:29:12.037 --> 05:29:16.740
And the exceptions need to be made for the children who truly need exceptions.

05:29:16.780 --> 05:29:26.887
And as Dr. Johnson, I think, just articulated quite well, Promise Academy is committed to making those alternative paths as needed.

05:29:27.068 --> 05:29:35.313
As Superintendent McMahon mentioned in San Jose Unified, they have the same practice of making different pathways

05:29:36.534 --> 05:29:37.075
as needed.

05:29:37.495 --> 05:29:53.694
And just to supplement what Dr. Johnson said on pages 82 and 83 of our petition, it does articulate that if students come to the school grade level behind, how the school will work with them through these individual plans to support them.

05:29:54.355 --> 05:29:55.756
Okay, just a couple more questions.

05:29:56.476 --> 05:30:05.160
Uh, it's been raised as a concern that, uh, the graduation requirements, which by the way, uh, would be like nine years from now or something, right?

05:30:05.200 --> 05:30:06.641
Seven years from now.

05:30:07.021 --> 05:30:19.968
Uh, uh, but that, that the expectation of AP exams, SAT, uh, ACT, uh, or a college course that, uh, that you, that those are required and that,

05:30:20.629 --> 05:30:25.734
I am going to ask you to confirm something for me.

05:30:26.414 --> 05:30:36.623
The reviewers of the petition did not see clearly in the petition that those would be paid for by the school or that they were in the budget.

05:30:37.424 --> 05:30:42.788
As I understand it, from my due diligence, they are in the budget.

05:30:42.928 --> 05:30:45.510
They are in line items in the budget.

05:30:45.831 --> 05:30:53.997
Given that the high school is quite a ways away, there is a buildup of funds that goes on between now and then to pay for all those.

05:30:54.197 --> 05:31:04.185
And that you, of course, as a seasoned traditional school public principal, understand the law in California that the school pays for all required fees.

05:31:05.360 --> 05:31:11.502
It's just that maybe you didn't either put it in the budget assumptions as clearly or put it in the petition itself.

05:31:12.042 --> 05:31:15.823
I think maybe you thought that everyone would know that you knew.

05:31:15.843 --> 05:31:25.927
That's definitely a weakness, the implicit understanding of some things that need to be made more explicit, and so I'm going to lean on an expert.

05:31:27.208 --> 05:31:31.091
I'm Dina Koren from Ed Tech who helped Anthony design the budget.

05:31:31.732 --> 05:31:44.444
And yes, all of those expenses, they are actually quite small when you look at the number of students, the number of courses, the expenses, the discounts that are provided to students who have high needs or are of low income background.

05:31:45.405 --> 05:31:56.474
And I think that we've provided maybe the CDE staff or maybe you as the board some more sort of documentation around which budget categories they come from, how would those budget categories be broken down.

05:31:56.754 --> 05:32:00.297
There are only so many budget categories that we have in the budget.

05:32:00.337 --> 05:32:10.185
So things like instructional materials, curriculum, the curriculum budget, the assessment budget, there's a lot of money in those budgets and plenty of money to cover those.

05:32:10.585 --> 05:32:11.446
In addition to that,

05:32:12.046 --> 05:32:17.269
Anthony understands the concept of creating a reserve, having an operating income expectation every year.

05:32:17.349 --> 05:32:28.494
So if for some reason the students take more classes or need more AP fee coverage than we expect, then we have an operating income and a reserve that would cover those things.

05:32:31.576 --> 05:32:31.916
Thank you.

05:32:32.016 --> 05:32:32.296
OK.

05:32:32.536 --> 05:32:33.317
Board member Strauss.

05:32:35.296 --> 05:32:44.948
I want to support some of my board member comments at first member holiday and thanking San Jose for their really thoughtful presentation and the commitment that they are ongoing been working for students.

05:32:45.348 --> 05:32:52.416
But also thank your team and your presentation as a former high school principal of a large comprehensive high schools urban.

05:32:52.577 --> 05:32:54.359
I totally understand the commitment you have.

05:32:54.839 --> 05:32:57.742
and you clearly are translating that into clear practice.

05:32:57.902 --> 05:33:03.248
And so I appreciate your commitment to students and for higher standards.

05:33:03.348 --> 05:33:05.650
And so I just would support the practices.

05:33:05.710 --> 05:33:12.237
It sounds to me like we have to do some modification to make clear your intent from what was actually written

05:33:12.757 --> 05:33:14.418
and I'll let some of my colleagues address that.

05:33:14.458 --> 05:33:22.224
I just wanna support the intent of the rigor of high standards of access to AP with support for students who can do it.

05:33:23.244 --> 05:33:28.488
And again, I support students applying and getting access to four-year colleges, I think the idea.

05:33:29.168 --> 05:33:39.556
Personally, depending on an acceptance is a problem because I expect the students in your program, they will get accepted, but I think our commitment is through K-12, not what higher ed does.

05:33:40.057 --> 05:33:47.663
So I just wanted to formally support the specifics and the focus and the team that put this thoughtful presentation together.

05:33:47.683 --> 05:33:56.490
I think your mission is right, and I think the board members have brought up various specifics that we do need to address, but just to support the mission and commitment.

05:33:57.830 --> 05:33:59.470
All right, Board Member Holliday.

05:34:00.471 --> 05:34:04.532
First of all, Board Member Sandoval, you haven't had a chance to talk on this topic.

05:34:06.292 --> 05:34:06.932
Dr. Johnson?

05:34:09.073 --> 05:34:09.713
Dr. Johnson?

05:34:09.733 --> 05:34:11.494
I did.

05:34:11.674 --> 05:34:12.314
No, just kidding.

05:34:13.614 --> 05:34:18.276
I heard some references in the testimony to disciplinary practices.

05:34:18.776 --> 05:34:19.556
If you could address that.

05:34:19.596 --> 05:34:23.377
I heard a reference to consequences for falling asleep in class.

05:34:24.337 --> 05:34:27.118
If you could just clarify the facts, please.

05:34:27.901 --> 05:34:35.985
Yeah, I'm not sure who it was who presented that, but I do know that we have a restorative justice process in place, and that's outlined in our petition.

05:34:36.405 --> 05:34:44.689
And so for any misbehaviors, any instances such as that, there's a process for understanding what's going on with a child.

05:34:45.549 --> 05:34:51.012
If there is any type of conflict, to restore that relationship, get them to the services that they need.

05:34:51.772 --> 05:34:57.035
So it's not, you know, enlisting that is that, okay, that's not a behavior that's acceptable,

05:34:57.555 --> 05:35:00.398
but how we deal with it is through restorative justice.

05:35:01.218 --> 05:35:16.491
At my previous school, we called it Return to Excellence, and so that was kind of our way of saying, yes, there was a mistake made, or there was something done that was contrary to our policies, but hey, let's walk you through it and get you back on track.

05:35:17.311 --> 05:35:25.218
Suspension and expulsions are, I mean, they're the last, last resort, and that wouldn't, definitely wouldn't warrant that.

05:35:25.858 --> 05:35:28.180
And we have restorative practices in place to make sure that doesn't happen.

05:35:30.081 --> 05:35:30.982
Yes, you want to comment?

05:35:31.142 --> 05:35:31.842
Thank you very much.

05:35:32.082 --> 05:35:34.084
Very quickly, I thought I'd just comment very quickly.

05:35:34.164 --> 05:35:45.911
Obviously, AB 1360 came into play after the petition was submitted, so a lot of our charters on appeal, and I have another state-approved charter that is in this situation where they're all kind of looking at their suspension and expulsion policies because of Assembly Bill 1360.

05:35:47.052 --> 05:35:54.658
We've already adopted, through their board, a fully compliant policy that has already been vetted by numerous local districts and county councils.

05:35:54.718 --> 05:36:04.546
So we are fully confident that the school, and if your staff would review that policy, they see that we comply with Ed Code 48900 and all the due process guarantees that are embedded therein.

05:36:04.586 --> 05:36:05.727
So I just wanted to make sure you knew that.

05:36:07.870 --> 05:36:10.031
Now Board Member Holliday, are you getting towards it?

05:36:11.011 --> 05:36:12.152
Almost done, almost done.

05:36:12.392 --> 05:36:12.772
It's okay.

05:36:13.932 --> 05:36:20.915
The other thing I noticed in the plan, a weekly meeting, so one-on-one meetings, is that with students and academic counseling staff?

05:36:22.028 --> 05:36:29.172
Yes, so each morning we have morning huddle and each teacher is responsible for 24 to 25 students.

05:36:29.332 --> 05:36:35.175
And so throughout the week, there are teacher office hours where they'll be meeting with those students to go over their weekly goals.

05:36:35.695 --> 05:36:47.402
In addition, each Friday, that grade level team comes together and they address the needs of, you know, they huddle and they talk about the meetings they've had with individual students, how to strategically group them and or dynamically group them.

05:36:47.802 --> 05:36:53.983
and regroup them from week to week and so you know that weekly meeting is going to inform how we respond quickly to our students needs.

05:36:54.003 --> 05:36:57.624
Okay board member Burr.

05:37:00.505 --> 05:37:16.868
So I just wanted to build a little bit on what board member Strauss and Ortiz-Lingon said that while I agree I really commend you on the intent of your petition and certainly on the setting of very high expectations for children who have otherwise been underserved.

05:37:17.648 --> 05:37:26.173
But what I'm a little bit concerned about, and you've admitted to this, that if you had it to do over, you might provide additional clarification.

05:37:26.833 --> 05:37:35.178
On its face, I don't want it to present an impediment to students who otherwise feel like they couldn't be successful.

05:37:35.898 --> 05:37:49.366
And I'll just say for me that, especially over the years, and people know about my commitment to charter schools since its inception, there's been growing evidence and concern about lack of service to special education students.

05:37:49.967 --> 05:38:03.335
And creating any kind of impediment for a charter school to enroll special education students, whether it's real, which I do not believe it is here, or perceived, we can't support those kinds of charters, in my view.

05:38:04.415 --> 05:38:13.099
We need to have a lot of clarification around graduation requirements versus graduation goals and some of those issues.

05:38:13.159 --> 05:38:24.524
So I just wanted to make sure that I wanted to be on the record about that because I do think that presents a concern about being in a welcoming environment for every single student to attend.

05:38:26.602 --> 05:38:28.463
And I agree with Member Burr.

05:38:28.883 --> 05:38:33.124
I do think that it is on its face value right now.

05:38:33.704 --> 05:38:43.266
The high school requirements could impede a number of deserving and appropriate students to be a part of this school.

05:38:43.886 --> 05:38:45.887
I really do commend the high expectations.

05:38:46.957 --> 05:38:53.000
I think it is, it appears to me that this is a team that is going to walk the talk.

05:38:53.080 --> 05:39:03.024
They are going to maintain high expectations every day in every way for every child, and I think we, I hope that we can give them a chance to do that, but I am not

05:39:04.704 --> 05:39:20.488
I'm not comfortable with the current graduation requirements as stated in this document without some alternative option, path, route for a child who, for one reason or another, cannot make that final cut.

05:39:21.408 --> 05:39:23.168
So do you have a motion for us?

05:39:23.188 --> 05:39:26.029
I have one, but we're finished.

05:39:26.049 --> 05:39:26.149
Oh, OK.

05:39:26.169 --> 05:39:28.409
Maybe we ought to get that on the floor now.

05:39:30.590 --> 05:39:30.930
Go ahead.

05:39:33.875 --> 05:39:54.370
Yes, I would definitely need to see clarification on the language of the requirement, but even if they were able to draft the language to make sure that these are our goals, by no means is this the expectation, you know, with, and I don't run charter schools, so I'm hoping that that side of the room can help.

05:39:55.291 --> 05:40:12.633
with 35 students as your senior class and you know I'm guessing that there is a projection of how it funnels up right so you have your k-12 and what are the the the needs that you need to deliver a robust curriculum

05:40:13.734 --> 05:40:15.456
to have the supports in place.

05:40:16.057 --> 05:40:19.980
Is there something in this petition that describes that plan?

05:40:20.341 --> 05:40:30.710
So how you will go K-12 and have a very comprehensive, robust curriculum, and can that be afforded with a number of students?

05:40:31.471 --> 05:40:31.771
Thank you.

05:40:31.992 --> 05:40:32.512
Yeah.

05:40:32.592 --> 05:40:34.394
And to speak to that point just very briefly,

05:40:37.159 --> 05:40:43.924
after middle school doesn't it in terms of all the complexities that high school brings, and I agree with you.

05:40:43.964 --> 05:40:51.310
I think that there is work to be done to explain that, to understand that, and to make that happen the way it should.

05:40:52.831 --> 05:40:53.732
Board Member Williams.

05:40:57.395 --> 05:41:00.698
So I am going to make a motion, but before I do that I'm going to make a statement.

05:41:01.604 --> 05:41:11.567
First of all, I want to clarify that the State Board of Education review of charters that come to us on appeal is a de novo review.

05:41:11.867 --> 05:41:13.267
That was referred to earlier.

05:41:13.287 --> 05:41:24.190
I think the comment by someone in the audience was that if the district says it's red and the county says it's red, then the State Board should say it's red.

05:41:24.790 --> 05:41:28.751
And if that were the case, then why would we go through this process?

05:41:29.571 --> 05:41:45.718
So the de novo review is that we totally respect the hard work it takes, both the political work and the analysis work and the budget of work and everything else that districts and county offices of Ed go through to reach their decisions.

05:41:45.818 --> 05:41:56.102
And as you can tell by having one of the board members here wanting to deny it and two of them expressing that they wished it was approved, this is difficult work.

05:41:56.282 --> 05:41:58.003
This is very, very difficult work.

05:41:59.384 --> 05:42:09.198
But our work at the state board level is not to uphold or deny what the district or the county found.

05:42:09.298 --> 05:42:10.239
That's not our job.

05:42:10.780 --> 05:42:13.944
Our job is to do a de novo review, which means with fresh eyes.

05:42:15.106 --> 05:42:24.756
So what we take into consideration, member Holliday and I as the liaisons, when we do so much due diligence on these, because we know you can't always guess right.

05:42:24.836 --> 05:42:27.338
You can't always bet right one way or another.

05:42:27.959 --> 05:42:32.323
So for example, we look at the CDE's analysis and see what we think about it.

05:42:32.944 --> 05:42:40.286
We look at the, go attend the ACCS meetings so that we hear all of the public comment during that.

05:42:40.706 --> 05:42:45.468
Then we review the CDE's analysis again if they've changed anything before it comes to the board.

05:42:45.928 --> 05:42:51.470
We also call our state board liaison and ask for special phone calls to clarify our questions.

05:42:52.550 --> 05:42:54.412
And then we come and do it all over again here.

05:42:55.052 --> 05:43:02.237
So we do as much work as we're capable of doing to make sure we fully understand what the issues are.

05:43:02.778 --> 05:43:13.666
And it is the regs and the law give us discretion to come to our own judgment as a state board about the value and merits of a petition.

05:43:16.681 --> 05:43:46.193
i've done considerable due diligence to ensure that i understand all the aspects of this and it's my conclusion that the petition does contain a reasonably comprehensive district description of the educational program that the instructional model is sound and innovative and especially for the the students that are being targeted to to come to the school uh... that the petitioners are demonstrably likely to successfully implement this program with the founder board an advisory group that are experienced knowledgeable

05:43:46.593 --> 05:44:05.796
and committed to doing all they can to ensure their target population that they seek to serve have the most success possible, that you are wanting to change the trajectory of their lives in the same way your life was changed by that 11th grade teacher that reached out to you.

05:44:06.479 --> 05:44:07.199
Dr. Johnson.

05:44:08.080 --> 05:44:23.469
So I do hear the concerns about the, not the high school instructional model, but about the lack of clarity around how students that aren't, as it turns out, might not be able to meet all of those requirements.

05:44:24.130 --> 05:44:25.511
What are the paths for them?

05:44:25.551 --> 05:44:29.173
What are the alternative paths to see that they either get a diploma with

05:44:30.473 --> 05:44:38.877
a graduation with diploma or graduation with certificate and are encouraged to pursue other and supported to do other post-secondary options.

05:44:39.637 --> 05:44:45.420
I, like I've heard from several of the board members, appreciate the fact that you didn't start out with low expectations.

05:44:46.340 --> 05:44:51.686
that you started out with high expectations and a belief that these students can accomplish this.

05:44:52.147 --> 05:44:58.314
And the woman sitting next to you from Boston, who has been in a school where she's seen this happen as well.

05:44:59.336 --> 05:45:03.821
But the board is not comfortable with the lack of clarity around

05:45:06.003 --> 05:45:26.053
the alternative paths, the multiple paths getting there, you make it clearer about how the ILP is like an IEP and a 504 and how that will dictate as you go through what options should be encouraged and are available for kids and what kinds of support the kids could have.

05:45:29.926 --> 05:45:31.607
What I'm going to do is make this motion.

05:45:32.088 --> 05:45:37.913
Member Holiday and I both support this petition.

05:45:38.533 --> 05:45:50.083
And I move to approve Promise Academy as a grade TK to 8 school for a five-year term effective July 1st through 2018.

05:45:52.688 --> 05:46:04.794
effective July 1st, 2018 through June 30th, 2018, upon fulfillment of the following, that the Promise Board will provide the CDE, whoops, Carolyn, can you pass that around?

05:46:05.234 --> 05:46:05.855
I'm so sorry.

05:46:06.895 --> 05:46:08.156
This is the exact language.

05:46:09.016 --> 05:46:20.582
This is a path forward that will allow this charter school to come back to us for a material revision with all the clarifications that you're asking to add a high school.

05:46:24.046 --> 05:46:25.042
So let me read this again.

05:46:50.652 --> 05:46:57.341
I move to approve Promise Academy as a grade TK through eight school for a five-year term effective July 1st, 2018 through June 30th, 2008.

05:46:57.422 --> 05:46:57.502
No, 2000.

05:47:02.929 --> 05:47:19.736
23, upon fulfillment of the following, that the Promise Board will provide the CDE with a revised budget, with positive three-year ending fund balances, a revised petition that reflects the State Board as authorizer, and a fully executed facilities lease agreement by June 15, 2018.

05:47:22.777 --> 05:47:43.895
So it would be an approval if the board approved for the TK to 8 to 8 portion of the school with the opportunity for you to come back at any time including later in 2018 with a revised description of the high school in the areas of concern that we've raised and ask for a material amendment.

05:47:44.936 --> 05:47:46.036
Is there a second to that motion?

05:47:46.677 --> 05:47:47.698
Board member Holliday second.

05:47:48.607 --> 05:47:49.667
May I make a comment?

05:47:50.148 --> 05:47:50.348
Yes.

05:47:50.508 --> 05:48:02.452
I believe as I sat through the ACCS meeting and listened to the concerns that were expressed, the concerns were with the high school program, the concerns were with the high school graduation requirements.

05:48:02.932 --> 05:48:14.556
When I reviewed the CDE, I know there were some other concerns that the department had, but largely I think they were the high school and graduation requirement concerns were the

05:48:15.316 --> 05:48:31.831
key concerns and that's why I think that if this charter school is approved that giving them the time once again remembering that they will not have a ninth grader for three or four years depending on how you

05:48:32.592 --> 05:48:46.241
you count it, giving them the time to fully respond to the types of concerns that have been expressed by the ACCS, the CDE, the county, the district and us.

05:48:47.241 --> 05:48:47.722
Makes sense.

05:48:48.342 --> 05:48:49.503
So, yes, I second.

05:48:50.644 --> 05:48:52.745
Any further discussion by the board on this?

05:48:53.866 --> 05:48:55.026
Board member Ortiz-Lacon.

05:48:57.048 --> 05:49:00.770
Is this something that the school, the petitioners are interested in pursuing this?

05:49:03.240 --> 05:49:06.923
I mean, we don't want to vote on it if they don't care to do this.

05:49:10.605 --> 05:49:14.988
Yes, we definitely will accept this proposal and we'll work to live up to your expectations.

05:49:17.530 --> 05:49:18.491
Any further discussion?

05:49:18.511 --> 05:49:21.053
If not, all those in favor, raise your hands.

05:49:24.567 --> 05:49:25.108
Oh, question.

05:49:25.508 --> 05:49:25.848
Sorry.

05:49:26.509 --> 05:49:27.830
It's more just technical.

05:49:28.611 --> 05:49:42.362
So I guess another way of doing this would be to approve the charter, but then to hold off an opening the high school until such, until we get more information.

05:49:43.423 --> 05:49:46.385
We have a motion on the floor and it sounds different.

05:49:47.960 --> 05:49:48.761
Yeah, it is different.

05:49:49.161 --> 05:49:52.444
So you're going to have to, if this one fails, you can close that one.

05:49:52.805 --> 05:49:56.048
All those in favor of approving the motion, raise your hands.

05:49:58.390 --> 05:49:59.371
Okay, it carries.

05:49:59.411 --> 05:49:59.812
Thank you.

05:49:59.832 --> 05:50:00.392
All right.

05:50:00.813 --> 05:50:01.533
Thank you very much.

05:50:10.482 --> 05:50:10.802
Okay.

05:50:17.099 --> 05:50:19.801
Yes, we're going to move on to item 25.

05:50:20.421 --> 05:50:22.742
Board members can take breaks if they want to.

05:50:23.183 --> 05:50:27.525
This is the revocation of the Beacon Classical Academy.

05:50:27.545 --> 05:50:28.626
Go ahead.

05:50:30.247 --> 05:50:30.787
Okay.

05:50:32.248 --> 05:50:40.513
Item 25 is an appeal from Beacon Classical Academy which had its charter revoked by the National School District on May 8th.

05:50:40.573 --> 05:50:41.734
That's okay.

05:50:56.875 --> 05:50:58.476
Yeah.

05:51:00.797 --> 05:51:01.257
Go ahead.

05:51:01.598 --> 05:51:01.898
I think.

05:51:04.339 --> 05:51:05.760
Can we clear the room, please?

05:51:05.780 --> 05:51:07.200
We're trying to do business.

05:51:07.660 --> 05:51:10.322
Please clear the room as quickly as possible.

05:51:16.885 --> 05:51:19.746
Please clear the room as quickly as possible.

05:51:31.439 --> 05:51:33.720
Two, three, four, five, six.

05:51:34.560 --> 05:51:35.480
Nobody else can leave.

05:51:35.580 --> 05:51:36.401
Okay, go ahead.

05:51:36.961 --> 05:51:37.401
May I go ahead?

05:51:37.461 --> 05:51:38.261
Yeah, go ahead.

05:51:38.661 --> 05:51:41.042
Please clear the room as quickly as possible.

05:51:41.302 --> 05:51:42.823
Okay.

05:51:43.063 --> 05:51:49.365
Item 25 is an appeal from Beacon Classical Academy which had its charter revoked by the National School District on May 8th, 2017.

05:51:51.465 --> 05:52:05.969
The action item before the Board is to determine whether to uphold the National School District revocation of Beacon Classical Academy if the State Board finds that the chartering authority decision was supported by substantial evidence.

05:52:06.929 --> 05:52:19.713
Pursuant to Ed Code 47607F4, the State Board may reverse a revocation decision if it finds that the chartering authority's decision to revoke was not supported by substantial evidence.

05:52:20.553 --> 05:52:28.516
In the alternative, the State Board may uphold a revocation if it finds the chartering authority's decision was supported by substantial evidence.

05:52:29.417 --> 05:52:39.701
The CDE recommends that the State Board hold a public hearing to uphold the National School District revocation of Beacon Classical Academy based on substantial evidence.

05:52:40.581 --> 05:52:42.362
Beacon has been closed as of June 30, 2017.

05:52:44.960 --> 05:52:53.351
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools considered the Beacon Classical Academy revocation appeal at its December 7, 2017 meeting.

05:52:54.112 --> 05:53:01.002
As Member Holiday mentioned yesterday, due to a lack of quorum, there was no motion made and no recommendation moved to the State Board.

05:53:02.123 --> 05:53:09.731
On May 8th, 2017, the National School District unanimously acted to revoke the charter of Beacon Classical Academy.

05:53:10.512 --> 05:53:15.157
On June 7th, Beacon appealed to the San Diego County Office of Education.

05:53:16.018 --> 05:53:21.404
On June 30th, 2017, the charter term ended and Beacon Classical closed.

05:53:23.200 --> 05:53:31.649
On August 9th, the San Diego County Board of Education took action to uphold the revocation of Beacon Classical Academy's charter.

05:53:32.309 --> 05:53:39.236
And on September 8th, Beacon Classical Academy submitted the revocation appeal to the California Department of Education.

05:53:40.517 --> 05:53:55.420
Ed Code section 47607C1, A through D, allows a chartering authority to revoke a charter if the chartering authority finds, through a showing of substantial evidence, that a charter school did any of the following.

05:53:56.480 --> 05:54:02.321
A, committed a martial violation of any of the conditions, standards, or procedures set forth in the charter.

05:54:03.161 --> 05:54:08.522
B, they failed to meet or pursue any of the pupil outcomes identified in the charter.

05:54:09.482 --> 05:54:17.468
C, they failed to meet government accounting principles or engaged in fiscal mismanagement, or D, violated any provision of law.

05:54:18.709 --> 05:54:36.642
Ed Code section 47607C2 provides that the authority that granted the charter shall consider increases in pupil academic achievement for all groups of pupils served by the charter school as the most important factor in determining whether to revoke a charter.

05:54:37.723 --> 05:55:02.277
Revocation actions must comply with specific procedural requirements pursuant to Ed Code 47607D, which requires the chartering authority to notify the charter school prior to revocation of any violation described above and give the school reasonable opportunity to remedy the violation unless the violation constitutes a severe and imminent threat to health or safety of the pupils.

05:55:03.237 --> 05:55:10.242
The process of notification by National School District to BEACON has been detailed in the in the item.

05:55:11.543 --> 05:55:14.906
CD staff is available for any questions that the board may have.

05:55:15.926 --> 05:55:16.807
Okay, good.

05:55:16.907 --> 05:55:18.228
We have a public hearing.

05:55:18.568 --> 05:55:20.049
Could I have a clarifying question?

05:55:20.290 --> 05:55:20.670
Oh, yes.

05:55:20.810 --> 05:55:21.130
Thank you.

05:55:22.351 --> 05:55:23.492
First of all, welcome, Lisa.

05:55:24.773 --> 05:55:26.274
How's it going on day one here?

05:55:26.854 --> 05:55:27.555
Item three.

05:55:28.856 --> 05:55:29.136
All right.

05:55:29.256 --> 05:55:30.097
Are we having fun?

05:55:30.177 --> 05:55:30.497
Yes.

05:55:32.526 --> 05:55:33.906
Welcome and thank you for your service.

05:55:35.047 --> 05:55:35.767
ACCS.

05:55:36.547 --> 05:55:37.787
Now there wasn't a quorum.

05:55:38.648 --> 05:55:38.908
Yes.

05:55:40.068 --> 05:55:46.029
So because there wasn't a quorum, my understanding was that there was there was no, there was an inability for a motion to be made.

05:55:46.129 --> 05:55:46.489
Correct.

05:55:46.709 --> 05:55:49.670
So that there was no then recommendation moved to the State Board.

05:55:49.710 --> 05:55:50.290
That's correct.

05:55:50.370 --> 05:55:51.050
Was there a vote?

05:55:53.731 --> 05:55:54.771
Yes, there was a vote.

05:55:54.831 --> 05:55:55.311
I'm sorry.

05:55:55.631 --> 05:55:57.832
And do we have the numbers on the vote?

05:55:59.324 --> 05:56:00.745
Let me, let me get those for you.

05:56:01.125 --> 05:56:01.585
I don't have.

05:56:01.966 --> 05:56:02.826
I think that'd be helpful.

05:56:04.087 --> 05:56:08.871
I just wanted to make sure people understood that the ACCS heard it completely.

05:56:09.132 --> 05:56:10.853
They understood the situation.

05:56:12.414 --> 05:56:18.459
It was only because one member evidently had to leave suddenly.

05:56:19.000 --> 05:56:21.101
And so, but they did take a vote.

05:56:21.282 --> 05:56:24.084
And I think that vote is pretty telling as well.

05:56:24.604 --> 05:56:26.026
So, yes, I apologize.

05:56:26.066 --> 05:56:27.347
I will get that right back to you.

05:56:27.367 --> 05:56:27.667
Thank you.

05:56:29.252 --> 05:56:35.100
Okay, and we understand the criteria here are different for the revocation.

05:56:36.041 --> 05:56:38.524
So could you comment on that, Lisa?

05:56:41.207 --> 05:56:43.110
You know, we're

05:56:44.468 --> 05:56:47.890
we've been approving charters, now we're talking about revoking one.

05:56:48.050 --> 05:57:01.157
So the criteria for that are somewhat... Yes, the action that's before the board is to whether to uphold the revocation if you feel that, if the board feels there is substantial evidence.

05:57:02.038 --> 05:57:07.661
So it's either to uphold or you can reverse that, reverse the revocation of the charter school.

05:57:08.121 --> 05:57:16.925
if you do not feel that the chartering authority, and in this case would be the school district, did revoke the charter based on substantial evidence.

05:57:17.385 --> 05:57:22.968
So those are the two actions before the board, either to uphold or to reverse.

05:57:22.988 --> 05:57:31.992
So you're not hearing a petition for a charter school, just making a determination whether you felt the chartering authority had enough substantial evidence to revoke the charter.

05:57:32.791 --> 05:57:34.615
And this is not one of our charters.

05:57:34.695 --> 05:57:41.707
So we've also been, you know, we've revoked some of our own charters, but I'm not as familiar with this process.

05:57:43.170 --> 05:57:45.855
And Judy, you may want to help on this too, but yes.

05:57:46.613 --> 05:57:51.196
This is not, we're not reviewing a petition and we're not reviewing the merits of the school.

05:57:51.736 --> 05:58:03.343
Instead, our charge is to look at what the revocation process was, make sure that it was followed correctly and that there was substantial evidence.

05:58:04.404 --> 05:58:06.245
Judy, is that a reasonable explanation?

05:58:06.265 --> 05:58:07.025
That's exactly right.

05:58:07.085 --> 05:58:14.648
We're just looking at the evidence that National considered and whether determining whether or not they had substantial evidence to reach that decision.

05:58:14.828 --> 05:58:16.989
If they did, then you uphold the revocation.

05:58:18.909 --> 05:58:22.071
Okay, I think we're ready now to open the public hearing.

05:58:22.151 --> 05:58:26.952
So each side will have 10 minutes to present.

05:58:27.232 --> 05:58:28.873
First, we have additional information.

05:58:29.454 --> 05:58:38.098
Just real quickly before I leave, the ACCS meeting, it was unanimously to uphold the revocation of the charter.

05:58:38.538 --> 05:58:39.518
So it was four votes.

05:58:40.599 --> 05:58:42.900
Four votes to uphold the revocation.

05:58:42.940 --> 05:58:45.361
Four votes to uphold the revocation.

05:58:45.441 --> 05:58:46.141
Yeah.

05:58:46.341 --> 05:58:48.122
And zero no votes.

05:58:48.402 --> 05:58:49.022
Correct.

05:58:49.082 --> 05:58:50.663
There was only four members at that time.

05:58:52.208 --> 05:59:05.607
OK, so now I'm ready for the people who are from the charter school who want to have us reverse the revocation.

05:59:05.647 --> 05:59:07.189
You have 10 minutes to make your case.

05:59:41.365 --> 05:59:43.546
So Amy, it's not showing up on our screen here, though.

05:59:43.586 --> 05:59:51.091
It's not showing up on your screen.

05:59:51.591 --> 05:59:53.032
Why doesn't this work?

05:59:53.052 --> 05:59:54.913
Is it the same computer every time?

05:59:54.993 --> 05:59:56.074
It's not a new computer.

05:59:56.094 --> 05:59:58.975
I don't know why you can't make it work.

05:59:59.115 --> 06:00:02.798
I think it's a good question.

06:00:07.777 --> 06:00:11.679
Yeah, could we look into this, Glenn, and why this can't be?

06:00:13.359 --> 06:00:20.182
Are they coming?

06:00:20.222 --> 06:00:26.905
Patricia, are they coming?

06:00:29.106 --> 06:00:29.666
This is ridiculous.

06:00:42.271 --> 06:00:42.971
Yeah, that's it.

06:00:43.051 --> 06:00:45.974
Okay, go ahead.

06:00:46.815 --> 06:00:47.516
Please proceed.

06:00:47.536 --> 06:00:51.620
What kind of presentation do you have?

06:00:52.481 --> 06:00:54.804
Yeah, just advance your slideshow that way.

06:01:01.450 --> 06:01:03.693
Good afternoon State Board members and Dr. Chan.

06:01:05.185 --> 06:01:07.706
Thank you for this opportunity to present our appeal.

06:01:08.366 --> 06:01:11.708
We are here as parents and staff representing the Beacon community.

06:01:13.268 --> 06:01:16.589
And we're asking you to please listen to the facts with open hearts.

06:01:18.350 --> 06:01:20.031
My name is Dr. Alma Van Nuys.

06:01:20.811 --> 06:01:24.893
I am the executive director of Beacon Classical Academy National City.

06:01:26.313 --> 06:01:30.895
Our team who is here will present a rebuttal of the CD findings.

06:01:33.024 --> 06:01:41.251
Very important, if the findings are valid, then we believe that you have an obligation to uphold the revocation.

06:01:43.093 --> 06:01:49.538
But if these findings have been refuted or remedied, then please acknowledge this.

06:01:52.241 --> 06:01:55.524
Integrity is not about being right all the time.

06:01:56.745 --> 06:01:57.946
It's about doing right.

06:01:59.369 --> 06:02:05.411
And when one errs, makes a mistake, it's about making things right, no matter the cost.

06:02:14.554 --> 06:02:26.418
Our team will be addressing the following concerns, findings, regarding substantial evidence that the violations were refuted or resolved.

06:02:28.513 --> 06:02:48.547
procedural errors, misinformation, false assumptions, false assumptions, misinformation, old data, illegal data.

06:02:52.629 --> 06:02:53.310
Findings A.

06:02:55.219 --> 06:03:11.191
Although National directed Beacon to make comparisons between two different charters, Julian and Beacon charters, we believe are different and therefore unlawful for the following reasons.

06:03:13.453 --> 06:03:19.177
Different authorizers, each charter can only be legally evaluated by its own approved petition.

06:03:21.138 --> 06:03:23.000
Additionally, charters are different programs.

06:03:24.634 --> 06:03:28.677
One was independent study and the other is site-based program.

06:03:29.938 --> 06:03:31.039
Different demographics.

06:03:32.260 --> 06:03:43.569
When we moved from being independent study with Julian to site-based with National City, 34% of those students rolled over to the new charter.

06:03:44.610 --> 06:03:46.171
So those are different demographics.

06:03:50.334 --> 06:03:52.496
Therefore, the only legitimate comparisons are

06:03:53.547 --> 06:03:56.209
between the two years that Beacon was with National.

06:03:58.230 --> 06:04:03.313
The first comparison that could be made was fall to fall, 2015 to 2016.

06:04:04.214 --> 06:04:13.060
However, National did discount those results because they said there was a two-week delay in starting those assessments, which was due to Beacon being homeless.

06:04:15.404 --> 06:04:23.249
The fall-to-fall data, including cohort data, revealed that students were on an upward trend towards charter target growth goals.

06:04:24.410 --> 06:04:34.917
CCSA used our fall-to-fall map raw data to confirm that academic growth is within the range of new charters for the demographics that we serve.

06:04:37.739 --> 06:04:43.063
All the data can be located in the following.

06:04:48.462 --> 06:04:49.184
that were provided.

06:04:51.248 --> 06:04:56.278
We're going to look at the latest results of CASP, which were provided.

06:04:56.298 --> 06:04:59.184
I'm having trouble with this.

06:05:01.934 --> 06:05:09.579
These bar graphs are taken off the CD website and put into charts to compare the two years.

06:05:10.220 --> 06:05:16.765
So for ELA, these are students who met or exceeded standards, we have an increase, an 11%.

06:05:17.745 --> 06:05:19.827
In math, we have a 4% increase.

06:05:20.207 --> 06:05:25.631
And you can also see that these charts also show a decrease from students in the lower levels.

06:05:33.115 --> 06:05:37.037
Looking at economically disadvantaged, again, we're going to see an increase.

06:05:37.658 --> 06:05:43.862
Grades three through five, if the data is not presented, it's because it was not included.

06:05:44.442 --> 06:05:49.285
But because we're able to access the data, we were able to pull the six through eight as well.

06:05:49.325 --> 06:05:54.988
So you have a 7% increase and then you have an 11% increase, a 2.5 and a 6% increase.

06:05:55.288 --> 06:05:58.690
Were the students moving towards the charter goals?

06:05:58.771 --> 06:05:59.291
Yes, they were.

06:06:02.808 --> 06:06:07.251
Math, Hispanic group, we have a 15% increase, a 4% increase.

06:06:09.492 --> 06:06:13.815
ELL subgroup, a 12% increase and a 5% increase.

06:06:15.916 --> 06:06:26.222
Now, National used this chart to show gaps, but the data is from another year.

06:06:26.502 --> 06:06:28.304
It's from the previous year.

06:06:29.477 --> 06:06:30.338
And it wasn't recent.

06:06:30.878 --> 06:06:32.659
And it's not aligned to our petition.

06:06:33.019 --> 06:06:40.665
Our petition says that 85% of our students will demonstrate at least one year of growth towards grade level proficiency.

06:06:41.505 --> 06:06:44.968
And students who are below grade level will make at least half a year's growth.

06:06:46.449 --> 06:06:47.409
So this is progressive.

06:06:47.649 --> 06:06:49.511
It wasn't expected to happen the first year.

06:06:50.611 --> 06:06:52.633
And I put together a little chart so you could see that.

06:06:53.113 --> 06:06:58.577
If only 30% of the group was able to attain that, then we would expect to see a growth each year.

06:07:00.578 --> 06:07:01.598
So let's take a look at that.

06:07:03.339 --> 06:07:07.300
This is the most recent data at the end of the year, spring, spring to spring.

06:07:07.980 --> 06:07:14.222
And what we see here is that the students at grade level, remember it's at grade level, who started the school year.

06:07:16.023 --> 06:07:18.003
So we saw from 53 to 58, and we saw a 5% increase.

06:07:18.023 --> 06:07:19.904
We saw 1.5 years, not the one year.

06:07:25.799 --> 06:07:32.044
And then for below grade level, from 52 to 57, 5% increase.

06:07:32.905 --> 06:07:34.526
And more than one half a year's growth.

06:07:34.886 --> 06:07:37.869
At least we see a year and .3.

06:07:38.870 --> 06:07:39.750
That is what we're seeing.

06:07:45.015 --> 06:07:45.995
Map results.

06:07:47.857 --> 06:07:51.040
We're looking at 52 to 74, a 22% increase with an average of 1.9 years growth.

06:07:54.801 --> 06:08:06.744
And we're looking at below, students who began the year below, from 53% to 72% shows a 19% increase, an average of 1.6 years of growth, not the minimum half year.

06:08:09.504 --> 06:08:15.406
English language learners, although they stayed at 30%, they did show a growth of 2.8 years.

06:08:18.087 --> 06:08:20.007
And for below grade level, they went from 44% to 63%, 1.2%, a 19% increase.

06:08:27.836 --> 06:08:35.002
Math, we went from 37 the first year to 89% of the students who started at grade level.

06:08:36.143 --> 06:08:37.364
And they showed a growth of two years.

06:08:39.686 --> 06:08:41.587
52% increase, 100% increase in years growth.

06:08:41.947 --> 06:08:45.750
And below grade level from 58% to 72% average.

06:08:47.912 --> 06:08:49.093
14% increase, 1.6 years.

06:08:49.553 --> 06:08:52.596
So our students were moving towards the proficiency goals.

06:08:54.807 --> 06:08:55.888
And you need to weigh the facts.

06:08:56.549 --> 06:09:02.294
The facts are that our demographics are 68% Title I, 57% English language learners.

06:09:03.275 --> 06:09:06.418
Average student entering Beacon is 1.6 years below grade level.

06:09:07.058 --> 06:09:17.488
According to CCSA, you will recall that academic growth is within the range for new charters with the population that Beacon serves.

06:09:19.295 --> 06:09:20.936
So consider the hardships that we went through.

06:09:21.996 --> 06:09:23.917
I wish I could get into more detail with you about those.

06:09:24.538 --> 06:09:25.478
No fault of Beacon.

06:09:27.039 --> 06:09:29.860
The school was homeless, red-tagged on 11-4.

06:09:32.161 --> 06:09:37.264
And the students did not return until February 13th, a total of 49 days.

06:09:38.845 --> 06:09:43.127
During that time, students were taught in a gym, a library, the park.

06:09:43.907 --> 06:09:45.308
But the students persevered.

06:09:46.280 --> 06:09:50.363
and completed all their work and made academic progress.

06:09:55.166 --> 06:09:56.727
Consider our LCAP results.

06:09:57.567 --> 06:10:07.614
Attendance rates increased, suspensions decreased, parent involvement by 50%, English proficiency by 20%, achievement across all subgroups.

06:10:10.096 --> 06:10:11.817
How about our financial accomplishments?

06:10:13.018 --> 06:10:13.418
And note.

06:10:14.468 --> 06:10:26.336
that we've had, according with our corporation, including the three years, no problems with our audits, successful audits.

06:10:30.858 --> 06:10:32.539
We proved that we were not sectarian.

06:10:33.840 --> 06:10:37.282
Repeatedly, this was one last situation that arose.

06:10:37.783 --> 06:10:39.344
It's a shared facility with a church.

06:10:40.592 --> 06:10:42.633
They use the facility in the evenings and the weekends.

06:10:42.653 --> 06:10:44.535
They rent it out to other religious organizations.

06:10:44.855 --> 06:10:45.736
They left two books.

06:10:46.436 --> 06:10:51.600
They were placed on a bookcase that was in a resource room where our general students do not access.

06:10:52.401 --> 06:10:58.545
And if RSP students are brought into that room, they are brought in and taken out and they're not allowed to touch anything else in the classroom.

06:10:59.406 --> 06:11:01.287
So we proved again, we're not sectarian.

06:11:04.849 --> 06:11:05.150
Time.

06:11:06.371 --> 06:11:06.711
Thank you.

06:11:09.633 --> 06:11:15.742
Okay, we now have 10 minutes for the people that want to support the CDE recommendation.

06:11:27.574 --> 06:11:32.139
Good afternoon President Kirst and members of the State Board of Education.

06:11:32.759 --> 06:11:37.805
My name is Maria Betancourt Castaneda and I am the new board president of the National School District Governing Board.

06:11:38.545 --> 06:11:46.654
On behalf of the district I want to thank you for the opportunity to present the district position in this action to revoke the charter of Beacon Classical Academy National City.

06:11:47.685 --> 06:12:05.984
I also want to thank the Advisory Commission on Charters for their thoughtful and thorough analysis of its issues and the members present on the December 9, 2017 hearing who voted unanimously in support of the recommendation to uphold the District's revocation of Beacon's Charter.

06:12:08.055 --> 06:12:18.990
We take our board responsibilities very seriously and are committed to ensuring a sound public education for all students, including the charter school under our district's authorization.

06:12:19.470 --> 06:12:22.815
This is why our governing board and cabinet are here today.

06:12:24.349 --> 06:12:28.653
The district did not arrive to this decision to revoke Beacon's charter lightly.

06:12:29.714 --> 06:12:39.642
As the authorizer of Beacon, we simply could not allow the extensive academic, fiscal, legal, and safety issues to continue without remedy.

06:12:40.843 --> 06:12:48.971
Our district is supportive of charter schools and the innovative programs and services they offer to students and families.

06:12:49.861 --> 06:12:50.521
in our community.

06:12:51.001 --> 06:13:01.964
In fact, the district has a well-functioning charter by the name of Integrity Charter, which has been successfully operating under the district's authorization for the past 13 years.

06:13:03.725 --> 06:13:12.427
We have asked our superintendent, Dr. Leangela Brady, to share with you a brief summary of our decision to revoke the charter of Beacon Classical Academy National City.

06:13:12.907 --> 06:13:13.187
Thank you.

06:13:17.350 --> 06:13:17.971
Good afternoon.

06:13:17.991 --> 06:13:20.132
It feels like evening, I'm sure, for all of you as well.

06:13:21.053 --> 06:13:28.697
President Kirst and honorable members of the State Board of Education, and thank you to CDE staff for all of the extensive work.

06:13:28.857 --> 06:13:31.338
I, too, have a PowerPoint that I sent up.

06:13:32.399 --> 06:13:34.881
So I'm not sure how to.

06:13:37.102 --> 06:13:38.583
Is it in the folder maybe?

06:13:44.566 --> 06:13:45.327
Yes.

06:13:45.687 --> 06:13:45.967
Thank you.

06:13:54.139 --> 06:13:54.880
Sorry about that.

06:13:54.900 --> 06:13:56.481
Yeah, we have it.

06:13:56.901 --> 06:13:57.181
OK.

06:13:57.321 --> 06:13:59.242
Is it playing like a typical slideshow?

06:13:59.262 --> 06:14:01.364
No, we don't have it now.

06:14:01.384 --> 06:14:03.625
It needs to be going to presentation mode.

06:14:05.707 --> 06:14:06.787
Just hit that.

06:14:06.807 --> 06:14:10.430
OK, I'll bring it over there.

06:14:10.450 --> 06:14:11.350
There you go.

06:14:11.410 --> 06:14:11.811
There you go.

06:14:11.831 --> 06:14:13.452
All right, great.

06:14:13.512 --> 06:14:22.418
As I stand here before you, I ask that the state board please uphold the NSD decision to revoke Beacon Classical Academy.

06:14:24.651 --> 06:14:50.297
As you heard and as you've read in the thousands of pages that we submitted and the two board members that were there at the commission to hear the facts and to review the documents, we did try to work over several years with BEACON and did do a lot of informal things to try to support them, including 125 page instructional audit where we went out to the school

06:14:51.237 --> 06:15:06.747
We observed their classrooms, their lessons, we reviewed their documents, we had some face-to-face meetings, and gave about 35 to 40 recommendations of ways that they could get their school back on track.

06:15:07.407 --> 06:15:11.670
However, when things didn't continue to continue without remedy,

06:15:12.330 --> 06:15:14.492
We did move to more of a formal timeline.

06:15:14.852 --> 06:15:23.397
Throughout the formal timeline, we extended timelines, we accepted late material, even though the law said we didn't have to consider those things.

06:15:24.478 --> 06:15:33.944
We did end up at a place where we had no choice but to make a recommendation to our board to revoke, which was a unanimous decision by our board.

06:15:34.184 --> 06:15:35.305
It was appealed to the county.

06:15:35.665 --> 06:15:39.848
The county also made a unanimous vote to uphold the decision.

06:15:40.248 --> 06:15:41.349
And again, as you heard today,

06:15:41.969 --> 06:15:48.896
from board member Holliday that the decision at the commission was a unanimous vote of the members present.

06:15:50.558 --> 06:15:57.586
While there were many factors that led to the decision to revoke, we did weigh academics as the most important factor.

06:15:58.612 --> 06:16:05.555
When we looked at the state CASP scores in the fall, it was our first indication that something might be wrong.

06:16:06.275 --> 06:16:12.757
We saw some significant decreases in those test scores, both in language arts and in math.

06:16:13.318 --> 06:16:19.560
And as you can see, several grade levels had 0% of the students proficient or advanced.

06:16:20.100 --> 06:16:29.526
Whether we look at the preceding year or not, still at the current year, there were 0% of students proficient or advanced.

06:16:30.287 --> 06:16:36.251
So of course, we wanted to look carefully at the local measures to see if students were making growth over time.

06:16:37.011 --> 06:16:44.837
When we did that, we got lots of charts that had very confusing data, and they appeared to be showing growth over time.

06:16:45.237 --> 06:16:49.380
But what we were seeing when we were visiting didn't match what the charts were telling us.

06:16:50.400 --> 06:17:08.009
When you look at the MAP data, which was the majority of the data that we received were from the MAP test, MAP data really varies only from five to 15 points within each grade level, yet the charts we got had ranges of 30 points.

06:17:08.649 --> 06:17:18.014
We also saw kinder through eighth grade on the same chart, which really gives this impression of growth over time, as opposed to really breaking it down and seeing what we were looking at.

06:17:19.915 --> 06:17:25.580
you see in a blue and red bar that it appears that they're growing over time, fall to spring.

06:17:25.980 --> 06:17:29.783
But what it doesn't show you is that that line above it is the norm.

06:17:30.104 --> 06:17:38.091
The expectation is going up and this chart needs to show us how students are doing in their growth toward the rising expectation.

06:17:38.731 --> 06:17:41.854
So what we did is we, sorry I went the wrong way here.

06:17:43.823 --> 06:17:53.228
We broke that down, and again, these charts that you see in here are illustrative of multiple charts that you saw in the administrative records.

06:17:53.268 --> 06:18:04.454
So in this one, it's just one snapshot, but every grade level was broken down in language arts and math to see, is that current achievement getting closer to that expectation, that norm?

06:18:04.494 --> 06:18:12.158
And we saw consistently over all of the charts in language arts and math that they were getting farther away from that expectation and that norm.

06:18:13.398 --> 06:18:24.885
In addition, when we looked at some of the data, you saw this chart in Dr. Van Nise's presentation, we were looking at cohort data, the current kids in the current programs in the current school.

06:18:25.325 --> 06:18:26.686
What was the projected growth?

06:18:27.006 --> 06:18:30.668
The projected growth was illustrated by that little chart.

06:18:31.989 --> 06:18:32.950
gold diamond.

06:18:33.550 --> 06:18:38.573
But the actual growth, what the students achieved, is represented by that purple bar.

06:18:38.734 --> 06:18:41.956
And you can see the students are falling short in every grade level.

06:18:42.416 --> 06:18:45.458
Now, you heard Dr. Van Nuys say, this was a different year.

06:18:45.838 --> 06:18:51.582
This was fall to spring the previous year, because at the time we were considering revocation, we didn't have the spring data.

06:18:51.982 --> 06:18:57.006
However, every chart that we had was included in the administrative record.

06:18:57.286 --> 06:18:59.267
And this is the same type of data that we saw.

06:18:59.447 --> 06:19:01.489
Again, it's illustrative for the presentation.

06:19:02.690 --> 06:19:06.534
When we zoom in on that chart, we look at what's called the conditional growth index.

06:19:06.994 --> 06:19:12.960
This says if an average student makes a year's growth in a year's time, that number is going to be zero.

06:19:13.781 --> 06:19:20.027
If a student is catching up and making more growth than anticipated, that number will be positive.

06:19:20.487 --> 06:19:25.970
But if a student is making less than a year's growth in a year's time, that number is going to be negative.

06:19:25.990 --> 06:19:28.771
And you can see across the board, those numbers were negative.

06:19:29.351 --> 06:19:32.613
That was alarming to us because students are not catching up.

06:19:32.673 --> 06:19:34.254
In fact, they're falling further behind.

06:19:35.771 --> 06:19:37.972
In the fall, we heard about the English learner data.

06:19:38.552 --> 06:19:40.173
This was also concerning to us.

06:19:40.673 --> 06:19:48.316
Only 2% of the English learners at the school were proficient or advanced in English language arts and 4% in math.

06:19:48.656 --> 06:19:53.978
When we went to the school, we found they didn't have a curriculum, although in their charter, they said that they did.

06:19:54.258 --> 06:20:00.801
When we went into classrooms, we saw, even in April, when we were invited, April 26th, right before revocation,

06:20:01.381 --> 06:20:05.244
They had a classroom that said, what is ELD?

06:20:05.884 --> 06:20:07.185
Written on their daily schedule.

06:20:07.626 --> 06:20:11.128
And several of the daily schedules had no ELD at all.

06:20:11.909 --> 06:20:18.754
So again, there were findings in all four areas, but academics was our main reason for pushing for revocation.

06:20:19.754 --> 06:20:26.682
There were also material violations of the charter, fiscal mismanagement, violations of law, and you heard safety concerns as well.

06:20:27.242 --> 06:20:35.711
And for these reasons, we ask that you uphold the National School District Board's decision to revoke the charter for Beacon Classical Academy.

06:20:39.721 --> 06:20:40.341
Good afternoon.

06:20:40.701 --> 06:20:45.764
My name is Kristen Armitas and I am a business advisory consultant for the San Diego County Office of Education.

06:20:46.604 --> 06:21:01.331
We received the petition on June 7th from Beacon Classical Academy National City and we reviewed that petition as well as the documents provided by the National School District in the same fashion that's presented to you today under Education Code Section 47607.

06:21:04.278 --> 06:21:19.108
The San Diego County Office of Education was tasked with making sure that the findings made by the National School District were supported by substantial evidence and that academic growth was considered as the most important factor in that revocation.

06:21:20.558 --> 06:21:32.105
The San Diego County Office of Education staff report found that the National School District followed the correct procedure in issuing a notice of violation and provided reasonable time to cure.

06:21:32.766 --> 06:21:45.754
The National School District had substantial evidence to support the revocation, and the National School District considered the pupil academic achievement for all pupil groups served in determining whether to revoke the charter.

06:21:46.966 --> 06:21:59.611
And so on August 9th, 2017, the San Diego County Board of Education unanimously voted to uphold National School District's decision to revoke Beacon Classical Academy National City.

06:22:00.391 --> 06:22:04.793
And so with that, the California... Yeah, I think your 10 minutes is up.

06:22:05.233 --> 06:22:08.035
We can ask you back in public comment.

06:22:08.095 --> 06:22:10.836
So our board member questions, I would say also.

06:22:11.316 --> 06:22:13.037
So you will have to stop at that.

06:22:13.097 --> 06:22:16.498
And now we'll take the public comment on the item.

06:22:20.270 --> 06:22:22.152
Would the following people please line up?

06:22:22.732 --> 06:22:30.200
LeAngela Brady, Maria Betancourt-Castaneda, Maria Dalla, Barbara Avelos, Alma...

06:22:32.159 --> 06:22:51.084
Sarmiento, Chris Carson, PJ Whitney, Kristen Armitage, Gretchen Shipley, Alma Van Nise, Elsa Flores, Tamara Peterson, Kathy Polley, Ruth Prado, Christine Kallenberg, Lorena Olson, and Janelle Rooley.

06:22:51.364 --> 06:22:51.724
Thank you.

06:22:52.605 --> 06:22:57.846
Please come forward.

06:23:00.745 --> 06:23:01.325
Good afternoon.

06:23:01.345 --> 06:23:04.128
My name is Barbara Avalos, board member of the National School District.

06:23:04.668 --> 06:23:18.538
I would also like to acknowledge and express appreciation for the support of Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez-Fletcher, the recommendation by the staff of the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools that the revocation of Beacon be upheld.

06:23:19.099 --> 06:23:27.225
And the unanimous vote of the ACC members present their recommend that the revocation of the Beacon Charter be upheld.

06:23:27.685 --> 06:23:32.152
Without a quorum, that recommendation was unable to move forward to you today.

06:23:32.513 --> 06:23:32.793
Thank you.

06:23:37.898 --> 06:23:39.219
Hi, my name is Chris Carson.

06:23:39.239 --> 06:23:42.421
I'm the assistant superintendent of business services with the National School District.

06:23:43.042 --> 06:23:48.986
NSD feels this is best summarized by the proposed recommendation by CDE staff to the ACCS.

06:23:50.147 --> 06:24:00.795
NSD action to revoke the BCA charter was supported by specific factual findings of violations of law, fiscal mismanagement, failure to meet generally accepted accounting principles, and material violations

06:24:01.435 --> 06:24:04.077
of the conditions, standards, or procedures set forth in the charter.

06:24:04.117 --> 06:24:14.885
Further, the CDE finds that NSD did consider increases in pupil academic achievement for all groups of pupils served by BCA as the most important factor in determining whether to revoke BCA.

06:24:14.965 --> 06:24:23.931
The CDE finds the findings of fact were supported by substantial evidence and that NSD did provide due process to BCA prior to revoking the charter.

06:24:24.492 --> 06:24:24.732
Thank you.

06:24:30.822 --> 06:24:38.165
Good afternoon my name is Paula Jameson Whitney and I am the Assistant Superintendent for Educational Services for National School District.

06:24:39.166 --> 06:24:47.850
I would like to state that the district weighed academics as the most important factor as we move forward in our process of revocation of the charter.

06:24:48.911 --> 06:24:55.574
As outlined in the district's presentation earlier the scores from the 15-16 CASP results were alarmingly low.

06:24:56.534 --> 06:24:59.957
failing to meet Beacon's stated growth targets.

06:25:01.077 --> 06:25:14.407
Further I would add that the district's instructional audit revealed a lack of curriculum, lesson plans and supports for English learners and even after our instructional audit

06:25:14.887 --> 06:25:27.997
Beacon did go ahead and contact us about what types of supports to put in place for English learners, yet when we did our visit in the spring, they had still not provided those supports.

06:25:29.418 --> 06:25:35.402
In addition, so with the English learner, lack of English learners, oh, wow, that was fast.

06:25:36.062 --> 06:25:36.443
Thank you.

06:25:36.463 --> 06:25:38.104
Thanks so much for coming.

06:25:43.439 --> 06:25:45.080
Good afternoon I am Alma Sarmiento.

06:25:45.540 --> 06:25:55.847
I am a member of the National School District Governing Board for 25 years now and the district worked with Beacon for about a year and a half trying to correct the violations of its charter.

06:25:56.208 --> 06:26:02.532
During this process I was most concerned about the lack of curriculum and progress for our English language learner students.

06:26:03.092 --> 06:26:09.657
It wasn't until midway through the past year that Beacon made efforts to acquire ELD curriculum.

06:26:10.197 --> 06:26:25.808
Dr. Van Nuys told our board in February that their board had adopted curriculum, yet when some of our board members participated in an invited walkthrough months later, they were just then introducing ELD, or in some classrooms, ELD wasn't included in the daily agenda at all.

06:26:26.588 --> 06:26:34.575
We want all students to have a sound educational opportunity and unfortunately Beacon failed to operate according to its charter and meet the needs of their students.

06:26:34.956 --> 06:26:35.216
Thank you.

06:26:39.144 --> 06:26:39.704
Good afternoon.

06:26:39.764 --> 06:26:43.307
My name is Maria Dalla, and I'm a member of the National School District Governing Board.

06:26:43.827 --> 06:26:49.451
Today, I'd like to read a letter from Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher in support of National School District.

06:26:50.192 --> 06:27:00.119
President Kurz and board members, I am writing to support the California Department of Education's recommendation to uphold the revocation of Beacon Classical Academy by the National School District.

06:27:00.579 --> 06:27:08.421
along with the Board of Education for the San Diego County Office of Education, and the members present during the last meeting of Advisory Committee for Charter Schools.

06:27:08.561 --> 06:27:10.262
I strongly support this decision.

06:27:10.782 --> 06:27:17.524
As the Assemblywoman representing the National School District and a mother of school-age children, I am a strong supporter of public schools.

06:27:17.784 --> 06:27:25.146
As such, I work closely with my local school boards to hold all schools to high standards and ensure opportunity and success for all students.

06:27:25.746 --> 06:27:31.272
To maintain accountability, a school board must provide effective oversight of charters within their jurisdiction.

06:27:31.732 --> 06:27:38.379
Our local schools must be trusted to encourage the same results from charters that they expect from their neighborhood schools.

06:27:38.880 --> 06:27:44.506
Unfortunately, Beacon Classical Academy has failed to provide our South County students, especially our English learners,

06:27:45.026 --> 06:27:52.132
with a quality education, engaged in fiscal management, committed materials violated by their charters, and violated provisions of law.

06:27:52.472 --> 06:28:01.780
For these reasons, I ask that you vote unanimously to uphold the revocation of Beacon Classical Academy by National School District as recommended by the California Department of Education.

06:28:02.161 --> 06:28:03.061
Sincerely, Lorena Gonzalez.

06:28:03.081 --> 06:28:03.782
Thank you so much.

06:28:03.822 --> 06:28:05.524
We have a copy of that as well.

06:28:05.584 --> 06:28:05.884
Thank you.

06:28:07.998 --> 06:28:08.538
Good afternoon.

06:28:08.578 --> 06:28:09.659
My name is Gretchen Shipley.

06:28:09.679 --> 06:28:11.460
I'm legal counsel for National School District.

06:28:12.141 --> 06:28:15.883
And we understand that charter revocation is a very emotionally charged issue.

06:28:16.063 --> 06:28:21.607
But I just want to take this opportunity to reiterate what you talked about at the outset, which is the legal standard here before you today.

06:28:22.128 --> 06:28:25.870
It's unlike the charter petitions we've heard earlier today, de novo review.

06:28:26.270 --> 06:28:32.715
The standard is at the time of revocation, did the district have substantial evidence to support its findings?

06:28:33.335 --> 06:28:39.542
And looking at all the information presented today and in the administrative record, it's clear that there was substantial evidence.

06:28:40.163 --> 06:28:50.414
And on behalf of the district, the board, the cabinet who are here today, I just ask that you all, we respectfully request that you uphold the district's action to revoke the charter.

06:28:50.795 --> 06:28:52.577
And we thank you for your careful attention to this matter.

06:28:53.258 --> 06:28:53.478
Thank you.

06:28:57.830 --> 06:28:59.311
Good afternoon, esteemed board members.

06:28:59.391 --> 06:29:01.992
My name is Elsa Flores, and I'm a staff member at BEACON.

06:29:02.713 --> 06:29:10.557
According to the NYU Measure U Force, when a disaster or crisis occurs, requirements are suspended.

06:29:11.437 --> 06:29:14.179
BEACON was without a facility and in crisis.

06:29:14.739 --> 06:29:15.839
NSD ignored.

06:29:17.080 --> 06:29:20.263
the major force clause and immediately began three audits.

06:29:21.485 --> 06:29:23.447
MOU finance and instructions.

06:29:24.007 --> 06:29:27.771
One, Beacon was unable to access their files from the building.

06:29:28.311 --> 06:29:33.016
Two, NSD declined to the dialogue to clear up my misunderstandings.

06:29:33.416 --> 06:29:37.200
Three, consequently, NSD issued an NOV on December 15th.

06:29:39.229 --> 06:29:50.738
Four, although BEACON could not access the files, BEACON refuted, remedied, or proposed to remedy every allegation by NOV February 7th in the deadline.

06:29:51.579 --> 06:30:02.068
I have many examples of, they wanted to over, to turn in all the information, but we're very, we're in a very tight crisis and the examples are right there.

06:30:02.148 --> 06:30:03.989
Please do review it and reconsider.

06:30:04.230 --> 06:30:04.550
Thank you.

06:30:09.755 --> 06:30:10.936
Hi, good afternoon.

06:30:10.956 --> 06:30:12.197
My name is Tamara Peterson.

06:30:12.217 --> 06:30:14.979
Two of my three children attended Beacon Classical Academy.

06:30:15.359 --> 06:30:23.486
I wanted to use my time to address items B1 and D3 regarding the Department of Industrial Licensed Contractor Information with information provided by Dr. Van Nuys.

06:30:23.966 --> 06:30:29.671
Labor Code Section 1720 required the use of DIR contractors when work is paid for by a political subdivision.

06:30:30.231 --> 06:30:36.054
Section 1721 of the Labor Code defines a political subdivision to include any public agency of the State.

06:30:36.454 --> 06:30:42.797
However, a charter school is a non-profit benefit corporation as defined by the California Education Code, section 47604.

06:30:45.799 --> 06:30:52.888
Section 47610 is understood to allow charters the use of non-DIR contractors to perform small construction projects.

06:30:53.248 --> 06:31:00.157
BEACON provided evidence of valid handyman certification as well as qualified work experience for the three contractors who provided those services.

06:31:00.638 --> 06:31:07.723
Beacon clarified its compliance with the labor code and proposed to hire not to hire DIR contractors moving forward.

06:31:07.823 --> 06:31:10.525
Therefore, those items were refuted and remedied.

06:31:10.825 --> 06:31:20.952
I'd also like to just say as a parent and as a spouse of one of the teachers, the first classroom review that they did that the district did was in the gym.

06:31:21.152 --> 06:31:25.595
I believe the students first day outside of their classroom environment.

06:31:25.655 --> 06:31:26.496
Thank you very much.

06:31:33.047 --> 06:31:35.890
Greetings to all board members and distinguished panel.

06:31:36.311 --> 06:31:39.915
My name is Ruth Prado, parent advocate for Beacon Classical Academy.

06:31:40.215 --> 06:31:41.236
I will address finances.

06:31:41.276 --> 06:31:47.483
The school provided their financial ledgers and bank statements that contained all the transactions and check details.

06:31:47.563 --> 06:31:51.868
According to CSMC, Beacon's back office updates to the SAGE reports

06:31:52.849 --> 06:31:53.990
weren't possible to change.

06:31:54.791 --> 06:31:57.493
And all the details were uploaded prematurely.

06:31:57.953 --> 06:31:59.634
We can address more later with questions.

06:32:00.035 --> 06:32:04.578
Alleged missing checks were fully accounted for through voided and canceled check copies.

06:32:05.279 --> 06:32:09.322
Beacon explained that checks were written in three sources, payroll, CSMC, and

06:32:09.822 --> 06:32:10.542
the school office.

06:32:10.643 --> 06:32:13.664
That's why there are three different numbering systems.

06:32:14.304 --> 06:32:20.307
Regarding contractors and tax benefit issues, after talking to six different entities, the tax benefits were reimbursed.

06:32:20.347 --> 06:32:23.949
Five, conflict of interest payments, reimbursements to Beacon were fully paid off.

06:32:24.989 --> 06:32:26.750
I urge you to reverse the revocation.

06:32:27.370 --> 06:32:29.311
These are rectifiable measures.

06:32:29.651 --> 06:32:30.552
No fiscal management.

06:32:30.572 --> 06:32:31.592
We weren't hiding anything.

06:32:31.692 --> 06:32:34.133
Unsuccessful dialogue with NSD also.

06:32:34.173 --> 06:32:34.914
That's why we're here.

06:32:35.634 --> 06:32:37.095
We welcome your more questions.

06:32:37.415 --> 06:32:37.695
Thank you.

06:32:43.902 --> 06:32:45.563
Hello, esteemed board members.

06:32:45.643 --> 06:32:48.404
My name is Catherine Polly, a teacher at Beacon.

06:32:49.064 --> 06:32:50.585
I will address item B2.

06:32:51.325 --> 06:32:54.667
There has never been a lack of grade level curriculum at Beacon.

06:32:54.987 --> 06:33:01.950
Grades K through 2 used a spelling, writing, reading program based on Orton Gillum phonics supplemented with standard based readers.

06:33:02.870 --> 06:33:12.479
Grades three through eight used grade-level literature books, which are aligned with Common Core and classical education, as well as a supplemental spelling using Greek and Latin roots.

06:33:12.919 --> 06:33:18.204
Math program used Eureka and Math in Focus, which are both standards-based and Common Core aligned.

06:33:18.865 --> 06:33:23.109
National stated that Beacon's ELD program was not Common Core aligned.

06:33:23.729 --> 06:33:25.409
and recommend EL Achieve.

06:33:25.909 --> 06:33:34.011
Beacon wanted to immediately implement this program in November 2016, but was denied the use of the district trainer.

06:33:35.191 --> 06:33:38.612
Once again, putting one more obstacle for Beacon's success.

06:33:39.092 --> 06:33:40.832
Please reverse revocation.

06:33:47.833 --> 06:33:48.534
Good afternoon.

06:33:48.594 --> 06:33:49.974
My name is Chris Kallaberg.

06:33:50.014 --> 06:33:51.074
I'm a teacher at Beacon.

06:33:51.964 --> 06:33:57.912
I would like to speak about refuting the findings of B-5, the Brown Act violations.

06:33:58.493 --> 06:34:02.838
The number of members were corrected after two resigned and one member died.

06:34:03.279 --> 06:34:05.341
The bylaws allowed for a temporary lapse.

06:34:05.521 --> 06:34:10.488
According to the bylaws, no staff or parents could be on the board due to possible conflicts of interest.

06:34:10.948 --> 06:34:12.689
This made it harder to find candidates.

06:34:13.129 --> 06:34:22.512
Beacon did their due diligence in soliciting new members and gave national proof of their searches through text, emails, agenda items that were listed in candidate information reviews.

06:34:23.572 --> 06:34:27.273
Those were on the minutes in 119.17.

06:34:28.013 --> 06:34:31.334
Beacon did not conduct any voting on 11.16.

06:34:32.195 --> 06:34:38.276
They finished a discussion after a board member left early, but stopped when a quorum was missing, when there was not a quorum.

06:34:38.617 --> 06:34:38.697
And 117.

06:34:40.317 --> 06:34:48.267
Beacon meeting minutes noted five members and at 4.17 a vote was retaken when an item was listed as information that voted on.

06:34:48.587 --> 06:34:54.254
We would like you to reverse this revocation because we have refuted the issues the Nationalists present.

06:35:01.454 --> 06:35:03.936
Esteemed board members, my name is Lorena Olsen.

06:35:04.096 --> 06:35:06.077
I am a Beacon parent and grandparent.

06:35:07.118 --> 06:35:11.601
Rebuttal of CDE determinations of finding D1 FERPA.

06:35:12.281 --> 06:35:18.505
Students who qualified for reclassification as English proficient were listed on a board agenda posted on the website.

06:35:19.166 --> 06:35:23.889
English proficient students were also celebrated with certificates and gift cards at an assembly.

06:35:24.349 --> 06:35:27.471
The other finding occurred at an NSD board meeting.

06:35:27.992 --> 06:35:29.853
NSD asked about the percentage of

06:35:31.654 --> 06:35:36.497
ethnicity and was told that it represented two students.

06:35:37.057 --> 06:35:43.361
This happened twice until Beacon learned that data was less than 10 students is not included.

06:35:44.081 --> 06:35:49.905
To address these findings, Beacon approved a FERPA policy and face-to-face meeting to apologize to the families.

06:35:50.345 --> 06:35:53.487
A complete record of the apologies was presented to NSD.

06:35:54.027 --> 06:35:55.808
The violations were corrected.

06:35:56.929 --> 06:35:57.229
Thank you.

06:36:02.657 --> 06:36:03.718
Good afternoon, board members.

06:36:03.778 --> 06:36:05.519
Janelle Rooley with Young Mini and CORE.

06:36:06.260 --> 06:36:09.403
From Beacon's perspective, this was an unfair battle from the outset.

06:36:09.563 --> 06:36:22.493
At the time when the district issued the notice of violations, which started the process, Beacon was homeless, as you heard about, due to a dispute between the city and its landlord, which the charter school really had nothing to do with, but ultimately couldn't access its facility during that time.

06:36:23.254 --> 06:36:29.916
We recognize that the procedures in the Ed Code and the regulations don't require the district to take extenuating circumstances into consideration.

06:36:30.616 --> 06:36:44.380
Nevertheless, the regulations do contemplate a legitimate, good faith, back and forth, iterative process around these violations where we can refute them, we can propose a remedy or we can actually remedy.

06:36:45.180 --> 06:36:46.261
Beacon did all of that.

06:36:46.861 --> 06:36:52.264
To every violation there was an answer, I'm sorry, there was a refutation, a remedy, or a proposed remedy.

06:36:52.764 --> 06:37:02.550
The district, though, applied its own judgment to whether those solutions, those answers, met its own subjective standard, and that standard was never actually communicated to the charter school.

06:37:03.310 --> 06:37:08.493
The district never engaged in discussion with Beacon about how the time scope might have met the district's expectations.

06:37:08.533 --> 06:37:08.793
Thank you.

06:37:10.322 --> 06:37:10.682
Thank you.

06:37:10.782 --> 06:37:11.142
Okay.

06:37:11.302 --> 06:37:14.323
I now declare the public hearing closed.

06:37:14.924 --> 06:37:21.666
And so we're ready for a board member discussion at this point or further questions or Bruce Holliday.

06:37:22.226 --> 06:37:22.486
Thank you.

06:37:22.727 --> 06:37:24.007
I am once again the liaison.

06:37:24.047 --> 06:37:24.987
It's been my day.

06:37:25.668 --> 06:37:30.950
So first of all, thank all of you who took the time to come here and make your testimony.

06:37:31.010 --> 06:37:31.670
Thank you very much.

06:37:34.631 --> 06:37:39.213
First of all, Judy Sias, am I, I am correct in assuming that they

06:37:40.433 --> 06:37:48.335
There is a moment in time when the authorizer makes their judgment based upon the information they have.

06:37:48.415 --> 06:37:50.335
That is the report.

06:37:50.435 --> 06:37:51.655
That is the revocation.

06:37:51.835 --> 06:37:56.756
And it's not that a year later or six months later things were different, right?

06:37:57.056 --> 06:38:01.597
We need to look back at that moment in time and the process that was used.

06:38:01.657 --> 06:38:02.578
Is that basically correct?

06:38:02.898 --> 06:38:03.318
I can't hear you.

06:38:06.297 --> 06:38:11.546
Sorry, you need to look to see if the district had substantial evidence at the time they conducted the hearing.

06:38:11.866 --> 06:38:12.047
Right.

06:38:12.688 --> 06:38:13.629
Wanted to clarify that.

06:38:14.110 --> 06:38:15.132
And Lisa, could you come up please?

06:38:15.492 --> 06:38:15.713
Thanks.

06:38:21.877 --> 06:38:39.221
So in testimony we heard a number of statements made refuting or attempting to refute what the authorizer had found and what you had obviously approved by making your recommendation.

06:38:39.881 --> 06:38:48.583
As you heard any of those statements of refutation, do you, have you changed your mind on any of those pieces of evidence?

06:38:49.511 --> 06:38:52.887
No, I mean what was what was described by the petitioner

06:38:55.347 --> 06:39:22.654
In essence, we went through each piece that was submitted to us and at each stage that the chartering authority went through, and we felt that they not only followed the education code in terms of when to file a notice of violation first and then inevitably a notice of revocation, we felt that they met each of those standards and also that there was substantial evidence at that time to move forward with the revocation.

06:39:27.196 --> 06:39:30.057
Are there any other board member questions or queries?

06:39:33.779 --> 06:39:34.119
Motion?

06:39:35.139 --> 06:39:39.181
Well, I am sorry that the charter school went through a homeless period of time.

06:39:39.221 --> 06:39:41.822
And obviously, that was very disruptive to their program.

06:39:42.142 --> 06:39:55.788
However, my sense is that the authorizer not only followed the correct procedure and process and gave ample time for response and change and improvement,

06:39:56.528 --> 06:39:59.929
I believe that they did have adequate evidence.

06:40:01.149 --> 06:40:08.871
I do think that the CDE review was thorough and accurate and therefore I would move the CDE recommendation.

06:40:08.891 --> 06:40:10.551
Is there a second?

06:40:10.571 --> 06:40:12.612
Second.

06:40:12.632 --> 06:40:12.932
All right.

06:40:13.792 --> 06:40:15.033
Any further board discussion?

06:40:15.833 --> 06:40:16.073
None.

06:40:16.213 --> 06:40:17.693
All those in favor, raise your hands.

06:40:18.733 --> 06:40:19.554
That's unanimous.

06:40:19.654 --> 06:40:20.534
The board is adjourned.
