00:00.000 --> 00:07.140
Good morning, everyone.

00:07.140 --> 00:11.820
Seeing that board members are now present, Brooks, will you please call the roll to establish

00:11.820 --> 00:12.820
the quorum?

00:12.820 --> 00:13.820
Good morning.

00:13.820 --> 00:14.820
President Darlin-Hammond.

00:14.820 --> 00:15.820
Here.

00:15.820 --> 00:16.820
Member Escobedo.

00:16.820 --> 00:17.820
Here.

00:17.820 --> 00:18.820
Vice President Glover-Woods.

00:18.820 --> 00:19.820
Here.

00:19.820 --> 00:20.820
Member Lewis.

00:20.820 --> 00:21.820
Here.

00:21.820 --> 00:22.820
Member McQuillan.

00:22.820 --> 00:23.820
Here.

00:23.820 --> 00:24.820
Member Olken.

00:24.820 --> 00:25.820
Here.

00:25.820 --> 00:26.820
Vice President Williams.

00:26.820 --> 00:27.820
Here.

00:27.820 --> 00:28.820
Member Roscoe-Gonzalez.

00:28.820 --> 00:29.820
Here.

00:29.820 --> 00:30.820
Member Petillo-Brownson.

00:30.820 --> 00:31.820
Here.

00:31.820 --> 00:32.820
Member Porter.

00:32.820 --> 00:33.820
Here.

00:33.820 --> 00:34.820
Member Rodriguez.

00:34.820 --> 00:35.820
Here.

00:35.820 --> 00:36.820
Member Yoshimoto-Towry.

00:36.820 --> 00:37.820
Here.

00:37.820 --> 00:38.820
Everyone's present.

00:38.820 --> 00:39.820
All right.

00:39.820 --> 00:53.820
In closed session, the board discussed and took action on the following legal matters,

00:53.820 --> 00:55.820
MSCV state.

00:55.820 --> 01:03.500
Now I want to ask for the public comment slide to be put on the screen so that we can take

01:03.500 --> 01:06.460
up our waiver consent items.

01:06.460 --> 01:08.080
There we go.

01:08.080 --> 01:14.380
The waiver consent items are waivers W-1 through 6, and we will now open the phone line for

01:14.380 --> 01:17.740
public comment queue.

01:17.740 --> 01:19.440
Let's take a moment.

01:19.440 --> 01:25.120
People who want to make comments should call into the number listed on the slide and use

01:25.120 --> 01:28.040
the participant access code.

01:28.040 --> 01:35.120
Remember to turn down the volume of your computer or live webcast to avoid background echoes,

01:35.120 --> 01:39.400
and public comments are one minute.

01:39.400 --> 01:44.320
Is there any public comment?

01:44.320 --> 01:48.440
There are currently no callers in the queue for public comment, so that concludes public

01:48.440 --> 01:52.080
comment for W-1 through W-6.

01:52.080 --> 01:55.080
Okay.

01:56.040 --> 02:04.040
With that, without public comment, is there a motion to pass these waiver items?

02:04.040 --> 02:05.040
Yes.

02:05.040 --> 02:06.040
Thank you.

02:06.040 --> 02:07.040
And a second?

02:07.040 --> 02:10.040
I'll second it.

02:10.040 --> 02:11.040
Thank you.

02:11.040 --> 02:14.040
We'll now hold a roll call vote.

02:14.040 --> 02:17.640
Brooks, please call the roll.

02:17.640 --> 02:18.640

02:19.640 --> 02:20.640
Aye.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.640
Member Escobedo.

02:21.640 --> 02:22.640
Yes.

02:22.640 --> 02:23.640
Vice President Glover-Woods.

02:24.200 --> 02:25.200
Yes.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.200
Member Lewis.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.200
Yes.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.200
Member McQuillan.

02:28.200 --> 02:29.200
Yes.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.200
Member Olken.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.200
Yes.

02:31.200 --> 02:32.200
Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.200
Yes.

02:33.200 --> 02:34.200
Member Petillo-Brownson.

02:34.200 --> 02:35.200
Yes.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.200
Member Porter.

02:36.200 --> 02:37.200
Yes.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.200
Member Rodriguez.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.200
Yes.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.200
Member Yoshimoto-Towry.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.200
Yes.

02:41.200 --> 02:42.200
Motion carries unanimously.

02:42.760 --> 02:43.760
Thank you.

02:43.760 --> 02:46.760
We're now going to move to Item 12.

02:46.760 --> 02:51.760
Item 12 is the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress System and the English

02:51.760 --> 02:54.760
Language Proficiency Assessments for California.

02:54.760 --> 02:59.760
We have the request for approval of the proposed addendum to the high-level test design for

02:59.760 --> 03:02.760
the California Spanish Assessments for California.

03:02.760 --> 03:07.760
We have the request for approval of the proposed addendum to the high-level test design for

03:07.760 --> 03:10.760
the California Spanish Assessments for California.

03:11.320 --> 03:16.320
We have the request for approval of the proposed addendum to the high-level test design for

03:16.320 --> 03:21.320
the California Spanish Assessments, the proposed California Spanish Assessment Revised Blueprint,

03:21.320 --> 03:27.320
the proposed Revised California Spanish Assessment General Achievement Level Descriptors, and

03:27.320 --> 03:34.320
proposed Score Reporting Structure, the 2021-22 results for the California Assessment of Student

03:34.320 --> 03:39.320
Performance and Progress System, and the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California,

03:39.880 --> 03:42.880
and we call this the Mega Assessment Item.

03:42.880 --> 03:49.880
And CDE recommends that we approve the proposed addendum to the high-level test design, the

03:49.880 --> 03:54.880
proposed Revised Blueprint for the California Spanish Assessment, and the proposed Score

03:54.880 --> 03:57.880
Reporting Structure for the California Spanish Assessment.

03:57.880 --> 04:02.880
This item will be presented by Cheryl Cotton and Mao Vang of the CDE.

04:02.880 --> 04:05.880
Cheryl, can you please begin?

04:09.880 --> 04:12.880
Good morning.

04:12.880 --> 04:16.880
Superintendent Thurmond, President Darling-Hammond, Vice President Glover-Woods, and board members.

04:16.880 --> 04:20.880
I'm Cheryl Cotton, Deputy Superintendent at the Instruction, Measurement, and Administration

04:20.880 --> 04:21.880
Branch.

04:21.880 --> 04:27.880
To assist with this item today, I have Dr. Mao Vang, Director of Assessment, Development,

04:27.880 --> 04:30.880
and Administration Division, to co-present.

04:30.880 --> 04:35.880
The item before you today is an action and information item.

04:39.880 --> 04:43.880
Thank you.

04:43.880 --> 04:47.080
Today's presentation will cover the following.

04:47.080 --> 04:51.600
Three action items for approval regarding the California Spanish Assessment.

04:51.600 --> 04:55.840
Then we'll go over the additional assessment updates for the California Assessment of Student

04:55.840 --> 05:00.360
Performance and Progress, or the CASP, and the English Language Proficiency Assessment

05:00.360 --> 05:02.880
for California, the LPAC.

05:03.440 --> 05:09.440
And finally, we will return to the CDE's recommendation for State Board of Education action.

05:09.440 --> 05:15.440
At this time, I will provide an overview of the California Department of Education's

05:15.440 --> 05:18.440
recommendations for approval.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.440
Next slide, please.

05:20.440 --> 05:22.440
Thank you.

05:22.440 --> 05:26.440
The California Department of Education recommends that the California State Board of Education

05:26.440 --> 05:28.440
approve the following.

05:28.440 --> 05:32.440
Proposed addendum to the high-level test design for the California Spanish Assessment, including

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
the proposed Revised Spanish Assessment General Achievement Level Descriptors in Attachment

05:39.000 --> 05:46.000
2, the proposed California Spanish Assessment Revised Blueprint in Attachment 3, and the

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
proposed Spanish Assessment Score Reporting Structure as provided in this item.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
Now I will have Mao Vang present the remainder of this item.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Thank you.

06:03.000 --> 06:13.000
Good morning, Superintendent Thurmond, President Darling-Hammond, Vice President Glover-Woods,

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
and Board Members.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.440
As Cheryl mentioned, I'm Mao Vang, Director of the Assessment Development and Administration

06:18.440 --> 06:22.440
Division at the Department of Education.

06:22.440 --> 06:29.440
And I will discuss the proposed actions regarding our California Spanish Assessment.

06:33.440 --> 06:52.440
So, the intent of the California Assessment per Education Code, Section 606405C, the superintendent

06:52.440 --> 07:00.440
is to develop a primary language assessment that would support, in part, for the seal,

07:00.440 --> 07:03.440
the state seal of biliteracy.

07:03.440 --> 07:10.440
And then we also have the Education Code, Section 51461, has requirements that support

07:10.440 --> 07:17.440
the state seal of biliteracy, which is the law that identifies the requirements that

07:17.440 --> 07:20.440
support that education code.

07:20.440 --> 07:26.440
And one of the requirements is for students to pass an assessment that, at a minimum,

07:26.440 --> 07:32.440
assesses speaking, reading, writing, and another language, in another language, in

07:32.440 --> 07:34.440
addition to English.

07:34.440 --> 07:39.440
So, when the development of the California Spanish Assessment began, funds were limited,

07:39.440 --> 07:44.440
and the speaking and writing constructive response items were not developed at that

07:44.440 --> 07:45.440
time.

07:45.440 --> 07:50.440
So, students were unable to use the results of the California Spanish Assessment to meet

07:50.440 --> 07:55.440
the one criterion for attaining the state seal of biliteracy.

07:55.440 --> 08:03.440
So, last November, 2021, the California State Board of Education did approve a new contract

08:03.440 --> 08:09.440
that included the development of the speaking and the expansion of the writing of this

08:09.440 --> 08:12.440
particular test.

08:13.440 --> 08:19.440
So, the proposed addendum to the California Spanish Assessment high-level test design

08:19.440 --> 08:21.440
is what we'll cover next.

08:21.440 --> 08:29.440
This addendum articulates how the test design presented in the 2016 high-level test design

08:29.440 --> 08:34.440
for California Spanish Assessment has been updated to include the addition of the speaking

08:34.440 --> 08:37.440
domain and the expansion of the writing domain.

08:37.440 --> 08:48.440
So, the team that worked on this addendum was done with input from the CASP technical

08:48.440 --> 08:54.440
advisory group, the assessment interest holder group, and Dr. Kenji Hakuta, who is a professor

08:54.440 --> 09:02.440
emeritus at Stanford, and Dr. Guadalupe Valdez, also a professor at Stanford University.

09:02.440 --> 09:10.440
And we will continue to meet and work with the various interest holders as we expand

09:10.440 --> 09:16.440
the speaking domain, as we develop the speaking domain and expand the writing domain.

09:21.440 --> 09:28.440
So, next I'll cover the California Spanish Test General Achievement Level Descriptors.

09:28.440 --> 09:35.440
These provide generic descriptions of student performance level expectations across three

09:35.440 --> 09:36.440
levels.

09:36.440 --> 09:46.440
Once those are approved, they will be used to set grade level or grade span specific

09:46.440 --> 09:51.440
achievement level descriptors and develop the reporting achievement level descriptors

09:51.440 --> 09:57.440
that describe levels of performance to educators, students, and parents or guardians.

09:57.440 --> 10:03.440
And these revisions include the expansion of, again, the California Spanish Assessment

10:03.440 --> 10:09.440
domains with the addition of the speaking to the general level achievement level descriptors

10:09.440 --> 10:14.440
and the removal of the word mechanics from the descriptor because the writing domain

10:14.440 --> 10:17.440
will be fully assessed once operational.

10:17.440 --> 10:27.440
Now I'll go over the revised California Spanish Assessment Blueprint, which includes updates

10:27.440 --> 10:32.440
to the 2017 blueprint that the State Board of Education approved.

10:32.440 --> 10:38.440
And it provides the proposed number of items and points for the addition of speaking and

10:38.440 --> 10:42.440
the expansion of the writing in grades three through eight and high school.

10:43.440 --> 10:51.440
So, the number of items and points are subject to revisions on the basis of statistical analyses

10:51.440 --> 10:57.440
of the new writing and speaking constructed response items after first field test and

10:57.440 --> 11:00.440
the first operational uses.

11:00.440 --> 11:07.440
And these are aligned with the California Common Core State Standards in Espanol as

11:07.440 --> 11:13.440
translated and linguistically augmented versions of the, which are translated and

11:13.440 --> 11:20.440
linguistically augmented versions of the California Common Core State Standards for

11:20.440 --> 11:23.440
English language arts and literacy.

11:26.440 --> 11:32.440
And now I'll go over the proposed California Spanish Assessment score reporting structure.

11:32.440 --> 11:39.440
So, the proposed reporting structure is included in the item and it has an overall scale score

11:39.440 --> 11:45.440
with three achievement levels, reading, in the domains of reading, writing, listening,

11:45.440 --> 11:47.440
and speaking.

11:47.440 --> 11:55.440
Then after the first operational administration in 2024-25, data will be used to evaluate

11:55.440 --> 12:01.440
the reliability of the score reporting structure and additional analyses will be conducted

12:01.440 --> 12:11.440
to determine whether we have enough items to support four achievement levels.

12:15.440 --> 12:23.440
In our next steps, once the State Board of Education approves these proposed recommendations,

12:24.440 --> 12:31.440
that each action will play a very critical part of us moving forward in the development

12:31.440 --> 12:38.440
of the speaking and the writing constructed response items to the operational administration

12:38.440 --> 12:45.440
of the California Spanish Assessment targeted to be in the 2024-25 school year.

12:46.440 --> 12:56.440
And that brings us to some additional, again, this is the assessment mega item, so we have

12:56.440 --> 12:59.440
multiple topics to bring to you.

12:59.440 --> 13:04.440
And now I will cover the additional program updates that, or highlight the additional

13:04.440 --> 13:07.440
program updates that might be of interest to you.

13:07.440 --> 13:13.440
We will share the science resources that are in the Tools for Teachers and then I'll walk

13:13.440 --> 13:19.440
through the student score reports, redesign goals and timelines that we have in the works.

13:19.440 --> 13:26.440
And then we'll go over the public release of the 21-22 CASP and ALPAC test results that

13:26.440 --> 13:30.440
just occurred a couple weeks ago.

13:32.440 --> 13:39.440
And the science resources that are being built in the Tools for Teachers, just want to share

13:39.440 --> 13:45.440
that in July, the California Department of Education continued to conduct our workshops

13:45.440 --> 13:51.440
to help California educators develop additional science resources for kindergarten through

13:51.440 --> 13:54.440
high school for the Tools for Teachers website.

13:54.440 --> 14:02.440
And this is built mainly with workshop participants who are educators and they're involved as

14:02.440 --> 14:12.440
team leads and developers and then our California science staff or assessment staff are served

14:12.440 --> 14:14.440
as trainers and coaches.

14:14.440 --> 14:21.440
And these additional resources are peer reviewed and posted, built by California educators

14:21.440 --> 14:28.440
for California educators for a total of 70 science formative assessment resources that

14:28.440 --> 14:34.440
are available to all public school educators in the Tools for Teachers.

14:37.440 --> 14:48.440
Another highlight is the redesign of the 23-24 California assessment of student performance

14:48.440 --> 14:54.440
and progress or CASP in our English language proficiency assessments for California or ALPAC.

14:54.440 --> 15:01.440
The student score reports, here are our redesign goals of this process is to improve the reporting

15:01.440 --> 15:06.440
of the test results provided to students and parents or guardians that include actionable

15:06.440 --> 15:13.440
item information, excuse me, and then also to provide students and parents or guardians

15:13.440 --> 15:21.440
with timely access to their test results while minimizing the distribution effort for local

15:21.440 --> 15:23.440
educational agencies.

15:24.440 --> 15:36.440
The high level timeline is provided in that just high level wise from September through

15:36.440 --> 15:45.440
January of this school year, ETS, our assessment contractor, is in the process of developing

15:45.440 --> 15:52.440
concept design options and will conduct formal focus groups and other more informal focus

15:52.440 --> 15:53.440
groups as well.

15:53.440 --> 15:58.440
As of right now, I'm at the California Educational Research Association Conference and we will

15:58.440 --> 16:06.440
be doing a couple focus groups from our conference participants about the same topic.

16:06.440 --> 16:16.440
And then in February through June, ETS will prepare mock-ups for CDE to get approval from

16:16.440 --> 16:22.440
the various interest holders and this is a time where our SBE members could provide

16:22.440 --> 16:27.440
some input and have time to weigh in before the final mock-ups are done.

16:27.440 --> 16:34.440
And then from July to August, ETS and the CDE will collaborate and use our feedback

16:34.440 --> 16:40.440
from the various interest holders and the design options that are provided and prepare

16:41.440 --> 16:47.440
reports planned for our September board meeting.

16:47.440 --> 16:53.440
And then in September, we plan to bring to the State Board of Education the recommendation

16:53.440 --> 17:02.440
for the student score report revisions for approval at that time.

17:02.440 --> 17:08.440
Now I will go over the public release of our CASP and ALPAC results.

17:19.440 --> 17:29.440
Okay, so the 21-22 CASP and ALPAC results were released to the public on Monday, October

17:29.440 --> 17:31.440
24th of this year.

17:31.440 --> 17:38.440
These are the academic and English language proficiency assessments that we use as a state

17:38.440 --> 17:42.440
to meet state and federal requirements.

17:42.440 --> 17:50.440
One thing I'd like to highlight here, before I go into all the assessments results, I'd

17:50.440 --> 17:55.440
just like to provide a little bit of context and background here that we do have one more

17:55.440 --> 17:59.440
assessment, the California Alternate Assessment for Science, that you approved the threshold

17:59.440 --> 18:01.440
scores in September.

18:01.440 --> 18:09.440
Those results will be released in December because we need more time to work on those

18:09.440 --> 18:13.440
reporting of those results.

18:13.440 --> 18:22.440
So just some background information to remind us that the 22-22 administration really marked

18:23.440 --> 18:29.440
the return to full statewide administration for the CASP since 2019.

18:29.440 --> 18:36.440
And remember that in 2019-20, many schools quickly turned to remote learning after the

18:36.440 --> 18:42.440
discovery of the COVID-19 virus in California.

18:42.440 --> 18:47.440
And then, of course, that year, the U.S. Department of Education waived all testing requirements,

18:47.440 --> 18:53.440
so there is no CASP or CASP results that year.

18:53.440 --> 19:01.440
And then in 2020-21, to further prevent the spread of the virus even before the development

19:01.440 --> 19:08.440
and widespread distribution and use of vaccines, most students continued learning remotely

19:08.440 --> 19:11.440
from home for most of the year.

19:11.440 --> 19:18.440
So during that year, local educational agencies that were unable to administer our statewide

19:18.440 --> 19:25.440
assessments, because it was not a viable option due to the factors that are related to the

19:25.440 --> 19:31.440
COVID-19 pandemic, were allowed the option to use locally selected assessments that met

19:31.440 --> 19:38.440
certain criteria that the Board approved to assess students' learning in English Language

19:38.440 --> 19:40.440
Arts and Mathematics.

19:40.440 --> 19:48.440
So when comparing results, the 2021-22 results to results prior to the pandemic, we must

19:48.440 --> 19:54.440
consider the continued impact of the pandemic on students, families, and educators in the

19:54.440 --> 19:57.440
21-22 school year.

19:57.440 --> 20:05.440
And the context just surrounding the teaching and learning in the 21 and 22 years was quite

20:05.440 --> 20:12.440
different and unique than in many LEAs when we look at the context surrounding teaching

20:12.440 --> 20:17.440
and learning in the 2018-19 or prior, before the pandemic.

20:17.440 --> 20:25.440
So the data from the 21-22 spring administrations should be considered baseline data for measuring

20:25.440 --> 20:32.440
student progress going forward due to those challenges that are presented by the pandemic.

20:32.440 --> 20:37.440
And the assessment results, again, just reminding people that are the really one measure of

20:37.440 --> 20:42.440
student achievement or proficiency in the case of LPAC, it should always be used in

20:42.440 --> 20:49.440
conjunction with other data and measures in making instructional or program decisions.

20:49.440 --> 20:53.440
With that, I will go over our SPAC.

20:53.440 --> 20:56.440
There stands for the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium.

20:56.440 --> 21:02.440
We use the English Language Arts or ELA and math assessments from the consortium.

21:02.440 --> 21:09.440
And here I will highlight our statewide results in all tested grades, 3 through 8 and 11.

21:09.440 --> 21:18.440
We see that in all students, we showed that 47% of students met or exceeded standards in

21:18.440 --> 21:20.440
English Language Arts or ELA there.

21:20.440 --> 21:30.440
And that we also showed the 2019, the last year prior to the pandemic, which is a four percentage

21:30.440 --> 21:37.440
point decrease from 2019, so from 51 to 47.

21:37.440 --> 21:45.440
And in mathematics, the decrease appears slightly larger with 33% of students meeting or exceeding

21:45.440 --> 21:52.440
standards in 2022, which is a seven percentage point decrease from 2019.

21:52.440 --> 22:04.440
And then we have the same comparisons in grades 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and high school grade 11.

22:04.440 --> 22:19.440
And then we also look at the percent of students meeting or exceeding, who met or exceeded

22:19.440 --> 22:23.440
standards by race or ethnicity.

22:23.440 --> 22:28.440
And when results are broken down by race or ethnicity, all student groups show decreases

22:28.440 --> 22:35.440
from 2019 in the percent of students who met or exceeded standards as well.

22:35.440 --> 22:45.440
And the groups that we look at are the American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African

22:45.440 --> 22:54.440
American, Filipino, Hispanic or Latino, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, White, and two or

22:54.440 --> 22:56.440
more races.

22:56.440 --> 23:04.440
So each of these have, again, comparing the 2019 through the 22 results for English Language

23:04.440 --> 23:06.440
Arts and Mathematics.

23:15.440 --> 23:22.440
And then we also look at the percent of students who met or exceeded standards by gender and

23:22.440 --> 23:28.440
ethnicity in the 2020-21 program, purely just to fit all this on the slide for you.

23:28.440 --> 23:38.440
The groups are, again, we see similar declines because if the overall, there were declines,

23:38.440 --> 23:44.440
then, of course, any of the groups would show some decline as well.

23:44.440 --> 23:51.440
And the results here for the other groups, student groups, also show decreases from the

23:51.440 --> 23:55.760
in the percent of students who met or exceeded standards,

23:55.760 --> 23:59.920
with the exception of ELA for students with disabilities,

23:59.920 --> 24:04.920
when we have the 16 to 16 there in terms of the percent,

24:05.960 --> 24:10.040
in English language arts across the board.

24:10.040 --> 24:12.800
So the groups that we, as I mentioned,

24:12.800 --> 24:16.920
also disaggregated the data for here at a high level

24:16.920 --> 24:21.280
are female by female, male, economically disadvantaged,

24:21.280 --> 24:24.440
English learner, students with disabilities,

24:24.440 --> 24:29.440
students who have at least a family member in the military,

24:29.520 --> 24:32.400
and then students whose families are homeless,

24:32.400 --> 24:34.920
and then students who are foster youth.

24:41.200 --> 24:46.200
However, although all these declines or decreases

24:46.200 --> 24:50.200
across almost all groups in English language arts and math,

24:51.040 --> 24:55.160
there are some early signs of learning recovery.

24:55.160 --> 25:00.160
I'd just like to share that we did have our ETS,

25:00.160 --> 25:01.320
our assessment contractor,

25:01.320 --> 25:05.360
conducted a two-year matched cohort analysis

25:05.360 --> 25:07.560
to explore how much learning increased

25:07.560 --> 25:11.160
for the same group of students at two points in time,

25:11.160 --> 25:16.160
between 2020-21 and 2021-22.

25:17.160 --> 25:21.000
And remember that in the spring of 2021,

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
only about 25% of students in grades three through eight

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
and 11, or about 740,000, yes, 740,000 students

25:32.880 --> 25:35.760
participated in the Smarter Balanced summative assessments

25:35.760 --> 25:38.480
for English language arts and mathematics.

25:38.480 --> 25:43.480
And in that analysis, or the analysis of that cohort,

25:44.480 --> 25:46.560
again, looking at the same students

25:46.560 --> 25:48.640
who took the test in 2021,

25:48.640 --> 25:51.800
and comparing their results to 22,

25:51.800 --> 25:55.240
show a steeper than normal achievement gains

25:55.240 --> 25:57.760
at most grade levels,

25:57.760 --> 25:59.400
which is really a hopeful sign

25:59.400 --> 26:02.440
that the state's investments in accelerating learning

26:02.440 --> 26:03.720
may be paying off.

26:06.040 --> 26:09.240
We are providing a sample matched cohort chart

26:09.280 --> 26:13.240
for mathematics in grades six to seven

26:14.160 --> 26:18.120
to highlight the mean scale scores

26:18.120 --> 26:23.120
for the 2020-21 grade six matched cohort

26:23.840 --> 26:28.840
and their results in grade seven in 2021-22.

26:29.080 --> 26:32.080
And the starting point here is kind of small,

26:32.080 --> 26:37.080
but I hope you can see that the starting point was 2495

26:37.080 --> 26:40.800
and the predicted scale score was 2512.

26:41.720 --> 26:45.080
And the observed was 2521,

26:45.080 --> 26:50.080
which was nine scale score points greater than predicted.

26:50.600 --> 26:53.000
So this rate of change for this cohort

26:53.000 --> 26:56.440
was 52% greater in mathematics

26:56.440 --> 26:58.640
than would have been expected

26:58.640 --> 27:02.040
for a similar pre-pandemic group of students,

27:02.040 --> 27:05.880
that is students who were in the 2017-18

27:05.880 --> 27:10.000
with similar grades six mean scale scores

27:10.000 --> 27:13.680
and their grade seven mean scale scores

27:13.680 --> 27:17.040
for the 2018-19 year.

27:17.040 --> 27:19.080
So additional match cohort analysis

27:19.080 --> 27:21.280
for all the available grades

27:21.280 --> 27:23.360
can be found in the interpretation guide

27:23.360 --> 27:25.400
that we have attached to this item.

27:26.440 --> 27:28.400
And it's called the interpretation guide

27:28.400 --> 27:32.320
to the 2021-22 statewide assessment results.

27:33.320 --> 27:38.320
So the increases here in a match cohort of students scores

27:38.320 --> 27:40.200
in English language arts and mathematics

27:40.200 --> 27:42.400
between these two years

27:42.400 --> 27:46.000
suggest that learning recovery may already be underway

27:46.000 --> 27:48.240
as going in the right direction.

27:48.240 --> 27:51.280
And while there's still so much more to be done,

27:52.240 --> 27:55.520
of course, in helping students excel

27:55.520 --> 27:57.000
and thrive in the coming years,

27:57.000 --> 27:59.760
this is certainly a positive sign.

28:00.760 --> 28:04.040
Then I will cover the rest of the other assessments

28:04.040 --> 28:05.200
that are under CASP.

28:05.200 --> 28:09.400
It's a fairly large program.

28:09.400 --> 28:12.800
So here we have the California alternate assessments

28:12.800 --> 28:16.320
or CAAs for English language arts and mathematics.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.000
There are three achievement levels

28:18.000 --> 28:20.520
for this particular assessment.

28:20.520 --> 28:22.160
And it is for the students

28:22.160 --> 28:25.000
with the most significant cognitive disabilities

28:25.000 --> 28:27.800
whose individualized education program team

28:28.760 --> 28:32.840
has designated that they use an alternate assessment

28:32.840 --> 28:35.120
on the statewide summative assessments.

28:35.120 --> 28:40.120
So the performance on the California alternate assessments

28:40.560 --> 28:42.240
for English language arts and mathematics

28:42.240 --> 28:46.760
are shown with slight decreases from 2019 also.

28:46.760 --> 28:49.360
And the statewide results for all tested grades

28:49.360 --> 28:54.200
show that 14% of students met standards in ELA,

28:54.240 --> 28:58.480
a 2% decrease from the 2019 year.

28:58.480 --> 29:02.280
And then in the California alternate assessments

29:02.280 --> 29:04.680
for mathematics, we see a similar decrease

29:04.680 --> 29:08.200
from pre-pandemic numbers with a percentage,

29:08.200 --> 29:11.480
8% of students scoring at level three,

29:11.480 --> 29:14.520
which is the highest level of understanding.

29:14.520 --> 29:19.520
And then a 2%, which is a 2% decrease from 2019 also.

29:20.320 --> 29:25.320
And then we also provide the other summaries

29:28.080 --> 29:32.120
for grades three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

29:32.120 --> 29:35.120
and grade 11 for high school.

29:37.600 --> 29:39.280
And then next I will cover

29:39.280 --> 29:44.280
the California science test or CAST.

29:45.280 --> 29:48.440
Students in grades five, eight,

29:48.440 --> 29:49.800
and once in high school,

29:49.800 --> 29:52.760
take the CAST in those particular grades.

29:52.760 --> 29:56.920
So students' scores or performance

29:56.920 --> 30:01.040
were generally consistent with pre-pandemic levels

30:01.040 --> 30:05.200
with a small increase for some groups in some grades

30:05.200 --> 30:07.160
and small decreases in others.

30:07.160 --> 30:08.560
However, we're just providing

30:08.560 --> 30:13.000
the high-level grade level here for you.

30:13.040 --> 30:17.320
And the statewide results in all test of grades here

30:17.320 --> 30:22.320
show 29% of students met or exceeded standards in 2022,

30:23.360 --> 30:27.280
with about one percentage point change from 29.

30:27.280 --> 30:31.480
And then again, the grades are provided there also.

30:34.480 --> 30:37.000
For the California Spanish assessment,

30:38.360 --> 30:41.440
the performance on this particular test,

30:41.480 --> 30:43.520
which is an optional assessment,

30:43.520 --> 30:46.960
is generally consistent with the pre-pandemic.

30:46.960 --> 30:51.400
2019 was the first year of this assessment.

30:52.480 --> 30:56.960
And it was the first operational administration.

30:56.960 --> 31:00.480
So when comparing the average score reporting ranges

31:00.480 --> 31:04.280
by grade, we saw slight decreases

31:04.280 --> 31:08.200
in grades three, four, five, seven, and 11,

31:08.200 --> 31:10.400
and the remaining grades stayed the same.

31:11.440 --> 31:16.440
And then moving on to the summative LPAC,

31:21.120 --> 31:22.880
the SART Language Proficiency Test,

31:22.880 --> 31:26.120
the percent of students meeting overall performance

31:26.120 --> 31:28.280
level four by grade.

31:28.280 --> 31:32.160
And level four is the cutoff for students

31:32.160 --> 31:37.160
who can use it as one,

31:37.920 --> 31:42.280
to meet one of the criteria for reclassification.

31:42.280 --> 31:44.640
So we showed that when compared to...

31:44.640 --> 31:48.000
So overall, when compared to the...

31:48.000 --> 31:52.720
We did provide all three years, 2019 and 2021,

31:52.720 --> 31:55.240
not all three, but not the 2020.

31:55.240 --> 32:00.240
But for LPAC, although there was the suspension in 2020,

32:01.640 --> 32:06.040
and then there's the flexibility in 2021 forecast,

32:06.080 --> 32:08.680
there was no flexibility for LPAC.

32:09.840 --> 32:14.400
So pretty much we did test about 89% of students

32:14.400 --> 32:15.880
in 2021 as well.

32:15.880 --> 32:18.800
So we're providing all three years of results

32:18.800 --> 32:20.240
for your reference here.

32:20.240 --> 32:22.920
And when compared to the school year ending

32:22.920 --> 32:27.000
in the 2022 there, the percentage of students

32:27.000 --> 32:29.120
meeting the overall performance level four

32:29.120 --> 32:34.120
was approximately 16% compared to 14 in 2021.

32:35.120 --> 32:39.760
And then 16 in 2020, 2019.

32:40.640 --> 32:43.720
And this is the level again, needed to be eligible

32:43.720 --> 32:45.040
for reclassification.

32:47.200 --> 32:52.200
Just to give you an overall, the 2021, 22,

32:52.360 --> 32:54.360
in that particular year, last year,

32:54.360 --> 32:57.000
the number of identified English learners

32:57.000 --> 33:01.640
who took the summative LPAC was around one million,

33:01.640 --> 33:03.720
a little bit over one million,

33:04.280 --> 33:09.280
which is a slight increase of 4.6% from the 2021 year

33:10.120 --> 33:13.520
when we only tested about 89% of the students.

33:15.120 --> 33:20.120
And then overall, most students or grade groups here,

33:23.920 --> 33:28.080
there were slight increases or slight decreases, excuse me,

33:28.080 --> 33:31.080
or stay the same from 2019,

33:31.080 --> 33:36.080
which is again, the last year before the pandemic

33:37.280 --> 33:39.720
compared to our 2022 year,

33:39.720 --> 33:42.400
with the exception of grades six through eight,

33:42.400 --> 33:45.280
which is slight, there was slight increases there

33:45.280 --> 33:47.400
in meeting overall performance level four.

33:52.600 --> 33:55.960
And these are, in this particular slide,

33:55.960 --> 34:00.960
we have the summative, the 2021, 22 summative,

34:01.480 --> 34:05.880
LPAC, which is the percent of students

34:05.880 --> 34:09.560
at each performance level by grade for your reference.

34:09.560 --> 34:10.720
Remember that last year,

34:10.720 --> 34:15.720
we conducted the alternate LPAC operational field test.

34:16.920 --> 34:21.040
The results were used to create the summative

34:21.040 --> 34:25.240
alternate LPAC results to meet that requirement.

34:25.240 --> 34:29.120
And these are the first reported results

34:29.120 --> 34:32.280
for this particular assessment,

34:32.280 --> 34:35.280
which again, is based on that operational field test

34:35.280 --> 34:36.480
that we did last year.

34:38.160 --> 34:42.240
And in the 2021, 22 year,

34:42.240 --> 34:45.120
the number of eligible students or English learners

34:45.120 --> 34:49.840
who took the summative alternate LPAC was around 16,

34:49.840 --> 34:51.960
a little bit over 16,000.

34:51.960 --> 34:55.640
And again, this is the students who are English learners

34:55.640 --> 34:58.640
who also are students

34:58.640 --> 35:01.920
with the most significant cognitive disabilities.

35:01.920 --> 35:05.320
So this is about approximately 29% of the students

35:05.320 --> 35:09.400
who test and met an overall level three.

35:09.400 --> 35:12.800
And the alternate assessments, we have three levels.

35:12.800 --> 35:14.480
And this overall level three,

35:14.480 --> 35:17.200
or considered fluent English proficient,

35:17.200 --> 35:20.680
are now eligible for reclassification as well.

35:25.880 --> 35:28.200
I would just wanna make one little note

35:28.200 --> 35:31.560
that the percentages may not all add up to 100

35:31.560 --> 35:35.240
for each grade level or a grade span

35:35.240 --> 35:38.320
due to rounding for the summative alternate LPAC

35:38.320 --> 35:40.960
and the initial LPAC results.

35:40.960 --> 35:43.360
So wanted to point that out.

35:46.040 --> 35:49.360
And then for the initial LPAC,

35:49.360 --> 35:53.200
this is the test where students who have a home language

35:53.200 --> 35:55.080
other than English were first enrolled

35:55.080 --> 35:57.320
in our California schools.

35:57.320 --> 36:02.240
And they take the LPAC, the initial LPAC for the first time

36:02.240 --> 36:05.440
to identify whether they're initially fluent

36:05.440 --> 36:07.240
or they are English learners

36:07.240 --> 36:11.000
who would need additional services.

36:12.800 --> 36:15.400
In last year, the number of students

36:15.400 --> 36:19.640
who took the initial LPAC was a little bit over 200,000.

36:20.240 --> 36:25.240
And 200,000, 208,585 to be exact.

36:28.160 --> 36:33.160
And that was about 84% of students who were administered,

36:33.240 --> 36:36.120
oh, about 84% of the students who were administered

36:36.120 --> 36:39.800
this initial LPAC are identified as English learners.

36:40.720 --> 36:43.080
And then only about 16% of the students

36:43.080 --> 36:48.080
who took this initial LPAC met the state definition

36:48.240 --> 36:50.880
of English language proficient

36:50.880 --> 36:54.000
by receiving an overall scale score,

36:54.000 --> 36:59.000
overall score level, performance level of three

36:59.200 --> 37:02.600
or initial fluent English proficient, as I mentioned,

37:02.600 --> 37:07.600
and are not required to receive English program or services.

37:12.280 --> 37:14.320
And I'm sure that was a lot,

37:14.320 --> 37:17.880
but I wanted to provide you a little bit more information

37:18.720 --> 37:22.600
that covers all the highlights of each of the assessments

37:22.600 --> 37:26.720
that we administer this past year

37:26.720 --> 37:28.720
that are available at this point in time

37:28.720 --> 37:30.880
and for our public release.

37:30.880 --> 37:35.080
The location for the public web reports

37:35.080 --> 37:39.880
is at this website that I've provided and also available.

37:42.320 --> 37:46.880
And it includes the summary reports by school,

37:46.880 --> 37:50.400
by district, by county and statewide levels

37:50.400 --> 37:53.400
for all students and student groups.

37:54.760 --> 37:59.760
And then it also allows for comparisons or change over time.

37:59.760 --> 38:02.840
We also have these performance trend reports

38:02.840 --> 38:06.240
by student group and the research files.

38:06.240 --> 38:11.240
Researchers can or anybody out there can take all the data

38:12.520 --> 38:16.080
that are available on the public reporting site

38:16.080 --> 38:17.760
and provide it in these research files

38:17.760 --> 38:22.160
that you could download and create other groups or looks

38:22.160 --> 38:27.160
by your particular school or region or area that by school,

38:28.240 --> 38:30.520
by district, by county, by student groups.

38:30.520 --> 38:35.520
So it's a very much used public reporting site

38:38.320 --> 38:41.040
for our California also researchers

38:41.040 --> 38:44.080
as well as the general public.

38:44.120 --> 38:46.800
And then we do, like I mentioned,

38:46.800 --> 38:49.760
we did attach the interpretation guide

38:49.760 --> 38:53.040
to the 2021-22 statewide assessment results

38:53.040 --> 38:54.360
for you in this item.

38:56.640 --> 38:58.760
And hopefully you will refer to that

38:58.760 --> 39:01.720
for more information on our public release.

39:01.720 --> 39:05.520
And then to help with going through our public release,

39:05.520 --> 39:08.360
we have a public website reporting site.

39:08.360 --> 39:10.520
Sometimes there's just so much information.

39:10.520 --> 39:11.960
Where do you start?

39:11.960 --> 39:15.120
We have these short quick reference guides

39:15.120 --> 39:17.840
to our public reporting website.

39:17.840 --> 39:22.000
And it provides you a quick overview of where to begin.

39:22.000 --> 39:26.040
If you wanna just review overall results, you go here.

39:26.040 --> 39:27.440
These are the steps you do.

39:27.440 --> 39:29.600
If you wanna compare test results,

39:29.600 --> 39:31.280
these are the steps you take.

39:31.280 --> 39:34.360
And then how to view change over time for test results.

39:34.360 --> 39:36.920
We also have a little how-to.

39:36.920 --> 39:39.680
These are little one-pager quick reference guides.

39:39.680 --> 39:41.240
And then we also have the,

39:41.240 --> 39:43.960
how to view this test results by various student groups

39:43.960 --> 39:46.960
and how to change and filter those groups.

39:46.960 --> 39:49.000
And again, a little one-pager to help

39:49.000 --> 39:50.640
and guide you along with that.

39:51.960 --> 39:54.600
And with that, that brings us to the end

39:54.600 --> 39:58.880
of our presentation and following,

39:58.880 --> 40:00.520
again, reminding you to follow us

40:00.520 --> 40:04.120
on Twitter at a CDE assessments.

40:05.480 --> 40:08.040
And then if you have any questions

40:08.040 --> 40:09.360
or I'll stop right here.

40:10.040 --> 40:14.040
And turn it back to our, oh, sorry.

40:14.880 --> 40:19.280
And then I will read our California recommendations.

40:19.280 --> 40:20.920
I'm not sure if or President,

40:20.920 --> 40:23.400
you want me to stop here for any questions

40:23.400 --> 40:25.280
or go through that first.

40:26.920 --> 40:29.680
You can certainly read the recommendation.

40:29.680 --> 40:34.000
And then what we're gonna do is take any clarifying questions

40:34.000 --> 40:35.920
and then we'll go to public comment.

40:37.520 --> 40:39.000
Thank you.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.320
So just as,

40:43.600 --> 40:47.520
just to go over the CDE recommendation for approval again,

40:47.520 --> 40:49.880
the California Department of Education recommends

40:49.880 --> 40:52.240
that the California State Board of Education

40:52.240 --> 40:53.800
approve the following,

40:53.800 --> 40:57.000
the proposed addendum to the high-level test design

40:57.000 --> 40:59.400
for the California Spanish assessment,

40:59.400 --> 41:00.920
including the proposed revised

41:00.920 --> 41:02.440
California Spanish assessment,

41:02.440 --> 41:06.160
general achievement level descriptors and attachment two.

41:06.160 --> 41:08.520
The proposed California Spanish assessment

41:09.040 --> 41:11.280
revised blueprint and attachment three.

41:11.280 --> 41:13.560
And the proposed California Spanish assessment

41:13.560 --> 41:15.120
score reporting structure.

41:16.240 --> 41:20.240
And with that, I will turn it back to you.

41:22.440 --> 41:25.520
Can you put up the public comment slide?

41:25.520 --> 41:27.240
There we go.

41:27.240 --> 41:29.080
So we're gonna open the phone line

41:29.080 --> 41:31.520
for the public comment queue.

41:31.520 --> 41:33.040
And members of the public that are wishing

41:33.040 --> 41:35.000
to provide comment on this item can do so

41:35.000 --> 41:36.920
by calling the telephone number,

41:36.920 --> 41:40.760
using the access code on the slide that is shown now.

41:40.760 --> 41:41.960
And then while we're waiting,

41:41.960 --> 41:44.840
I wanna ask our liaison member, Roscoe Gonzalez,

41:44.840 --> 41:48.200
if she has any initial comments before me,

41:48.200 --> 41:50.200
then we'll see if there are any clarifying questions

41:50.200 --> 41:51.320
from the board.

41:51.320 --> 41:53.400
And then we'll go to the public comment

41:53.400 --> 41:55.280
and come back for discussion.

41:55.280 --> 41:56.840
Member Roscoe Gonzalez.

41:59.400 --> 42:02.720
Hello, I'm going to go ahead and pull it up.

42:03.680 --> 42:07.960
Okay, so it's quite a bit that I have actually on this.

42:09.080 --> 42:12.120
So I know from this data and thank you, Melvang,

42:12.120 --> 42:16.280
for such a extensive and detailed presentation.

42:16.280 --> 42:18.680
The pandemic has been extremely challenging

42:18.680 --> 42:22.040
on so many levels and it was anticipated,

42:22.040 --> 42:24.120
I think that there would be a direct correlation

42:24.120 --> 42:25.520
to the academic progress.

42:25.520 --> 42:28.800
I can tell you that a teacher in the classroom

42:28.800 --> 42:31.120
through the pandemic and through the years

42:31.120 --> 42:33.440
that we've had in the past before we start,

42:33.440 --> 42:36.440
before we encountered this new obstacle.

42:36.440 --> 42:39.040
It has always been a steady progress

42:39.040 --> 42:41.480
of students growth in the classroom.

42:41.480 --> 42:45.240
And as the pandemic hit,

42:45.240 --> 42:47.120
we were trying to survive in the class.

42:47.120 --> 42:51.160
So I can say that that survive distance learning

42:51.160 --> 42:54.120
and to have students be engaged.

42:54.120 --> 42:57.680
And we were so focused on their social emotional status

42:57.680 --> 42:58.960
and how they were feeling.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.760
And that was also a hurdle that we encountered.

43:02.760 --> 43:04.880
So with that being said,

43:04.880 --> 43:06.720
I see the concern that the data shows

43:06.720 --> 43:09.720
that students in California have not been progressing

43:09.720 --> 43:11.920
at the rate that we would like to see.

43:11.920 --> 43:15.040
However, also I heard Superintendent Thurmond

43:15.040 --> 43:16.480
just announced yesterday morning

43:16.480 --> 43:18.800
that the learning recovery block grant

43:18.800 --> 43:21.440
will give students an opportunity to receive services

43:21.440 --> 43:23.840
that will enhance classroom learning.

43:23.840 --> 43:26.560
On a personal note, I want to share with you

43:26.560 --> 43:29.080
that these funds are critical to school districts

43:29.080 --> 43:33.520
and have, and they're extremely important to students

43:33.520 --> 43:35.880
of low income students like mine.

43:35.880 --> 43:38.640
Students will, districts will use funds

43:38.640 --> 43:41.440
for learning recovery to have students receive

43:41.440 --> 43:44.280
purposeful explicit intervention and reading.

43:44.280 --> 43:45.920
As an elementary school teacher,

43:45.920 --> 43:49.240
I have seen these funds help close the achievement gap.

43:49.240 --> 43:51.200
I think that if we continue to provide students

43:51.200 --> 43:52.960
with opportunities for tutoring,

43:52.960 --> 43:56.080
expended after school and summer opportunities,

43:56.080 --> 43:58.720
and teacher led professional learning in literacy,

43:58.720 --> 43:59.640
science and math,

43:59.640 --> 44:02.640
we will continue to see considerable improvements

44:02.640 --> 44:05.320
in student performance and standards proficiency.

44:06.360 --> 44:07.680
The data provided,

44:08.680 --> 44:13.680
I think that some of the great tools that we have access to

44:13.920 --> 44:17.800
is the California Assessment Accessibility Resource Graphics.

44:17.800 --> 44:20.320
I think these graphics display universal tools

44:20.320 --> 44:23.440
and designated supports and accommodations allowed

44:23.440 --> 44:26.000
as part of the CASP and LPAC systems.

44:26.960 --> 44:30.160
And there's also these great tools that I saw

44:30.160 --> 44:34.560
from the Smarter Balanced Annotated Response Tool videos

44:34.560 --> 44:38.520
and the Smarter Annotated Response Tool videos showcase

44:38.520 --> 44:40.800
some of the student writing scores,

44:40.800 --> 44:43.320
score on the Smarter Balanced ELA Performance Task

44:43.320 --> 44:44.800
and how educators can use the tool

44:44.800 --> 44:46.920
to support student writing.

44:46.920 --> 44:48.920
I think these tools are useful when planning

44:48.920 --> 44:50.920
and creating student goals.

44:50.920 --> 44:54.040
As teachers, we collaborate and plan with our grade levels

44:54.040 --> 44:55.440
during this allocated time.

44:55.440 --> 44:57.200
And it's an opportunity to guide this work

44:57.200 --> 44:59.120
by looking at student samples,

44:59.120 --> 45:00.840
curating and developing lessons

45:00.840 --> 45:03.680
that contribute standards proficiency.

45:03.680 --> 45:05.480
As a teacher and a parent with children

45:05.480 --> 45:06.520
taking the state test,

45:06.520 --> 45:09.720
I think that it matters most in knowing where we're going

45:09.720 --> 45:12.040
and how we're going to get there.

45:12.040 --> 45:14.640
And now is a time to be deliberate

45:14.640 --> 45:16.240
about the work we do in the class

45:16.240 --> 45:18.640
and to collaborate with our peers.

45:18.640 --> 45:19.640
When we work together,

45:19.640 --> 45:21.440
we create a better learning experience

45:21.440 --> 45:23.560
and teacher's collaboration

45:23.560 --> 45:25.440
positively impacts student achievement

45:25.440 --> 45:29.400
and allows us as educators to explore in your territory.

45:29.400 --> 45:31.960
And all this data just tells me

45:31.960 --> 45:34.080
that there's lots of work to be done.

45:34.080 --> 45:38.720
And yesterday, a lot of it is not so much

45:38.720 --> 45:40.000
at the rate that we're learning,

45:40.000 --> 45:41.440
but how we pace ourselves.

45:41.440 --> 45:44.640
And we are just so deliberate about the lessons

45:44.640 --> 45:48.120
that we provide our students to increase student achievement.

45:48.120 --> 45:49.000
And there's so much more,

45:49.000 --> 45:51.200
but I wanna leave for public comment,

45:51.200 --> 45:53.280
but I wanted to give you a little insight

45:53.280 --> 45:56.240
as a teacher in the classroom when we see this data.

45:56.240 --> 45:59.720
And we see that it's quick to say

45:59.720 --> 46:01.160
that students aren't performing,

46:01.160 --> 46:04.400
but I think that considering the situation,

46:04.400 --> 46:06.200
I think we're progressing

46:06.200 --> 46:09.480
and there's so much more work to be done.

46:09.480 --> 46:11.720
And I think that teachers are ready to embark

46:11.720 --> 46:16.720
on this journey to get our students to rise

46:17.400 --> 46:21.200
to the occasion to increase our students' scores.

46:21.200 --> 46:23.160
Thank you so much.

46:23.160 --> 46:25.960
I wanna, as the second liaison,

46:25.960 --> 46:30.960
offer a couple of comments about the work that Mal described.

46:31.640 --> 46:34.800
First of all, I just wanna note my appreciation

46:34.800 --> 46:36.720
for the improvements in the Spanish test

46:37.680 --> 46:40.800
that really, that we asked for a couple of years ago.

46:40.800 --> 46:43.200
It's great to see those coming to fruition.

46:43.200 --> 46:46.160
They make it more authentic with speaking and writing

46:46.160 --> 46:47.440
as well as listening and reading.

46:47.440 --> 46:49.480
It's sort of beyond bubbling in.

46:49.480 --> 46:51.200
It's really the use of the language

46:51.200 --> 46:54.400
and real communication with open-ended responses,

46:54.400 --> 46:57.280
which is something we're seeking to do in our assessments.

46:57.280 --> 47:00.520
So it's great to see that coming to fruition.

47:00.520 --> 47:02.360
Thank you, Mal and team

47:02.360 --> 47:04.840
for all of the work that went into that.

47:04.840 --> 47:07.080
And I really appreciate the deep dive

47:07.080 --> 47:10.400
into the Smarter Balanced results.

47:10.400 --> 47:14.360
As Gabriela said, we're all interested in understanding it

47:14.360 --> 47:16.920
and then responding to the data.

47:17.800 --> 47:21.480
The cohort level data are particularly interesting.

47:21.480 --> 47:24.720
The cohort rate of gain that you showed,

47:24.720 --> 47:28.280
which gives us some insight into how the investments

47:28.280 --> 47:32.640
that we're making may be paying off.

47:32.640 --> 47:35.560
Just another note for folks,

47:35.560 --> 47:38.240
because we had the opportunity to look at the data

47:38.240 --> 47:39.880
all kinds of different ways.

47:40.960 --> 47:42.480
As I mentioned yesterday,

47:43.400 --> 47:46.160
individual students are not falling backwards.

47:46.160 --> 47:48.040
They are still continuing to make progress,

47:48.040 --> 47:53.040
albeit in the years from 2020 to 2021 at a slower rate.

47:55.800 --> 48:00.640
The overall levels of performance on the scale scores

48:00.640 --> 48:05.640
are basically back to about where they were in 2015, 2016.

48:05.800 --> 48:09.280
So we have been seeing increases each year.

48:09.280 --> 48:12.760
This kind of resets us to that level,

48:12.760 --> 48:16.520
but we also see this steeper potential gain.

48:16.520 --> 48:19.000
And that's our goal in the coming years.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.720
As member Roscoe Gonzalo said,

48:21.720 --> 48:24.560
we have a great deal of work to do to accelerate learning

48:24.560 --> 48:26.600
and that is going on.

48:26.600 --> 48:28.880
What we know about how to accelerate learning,

48:28.880 --> 48:32.360
Superintendent Thurman has a series of webinars

48:32.360 --> 48:34.600
on learning acceleration.

48:34.640 --> 48:39.640
CCEE has put in place a number of resources

48:40.640 --> 48:42.960
for districts around learning acceleration.

48:43.800 --> 48:47.920
Time matters, additional times that we've funded

48:47.920 --> 48:52.920
after school and summer programming across the state.

48:53.280 --> 48:56.320
Personalization matters, meeting students where they are

48:56.320 --> 48:59.400
in their zone of proximal development around skills,

48:59.400 --> 49:01.040
differentiating in the classroom,

49:01.040 --> 49:05.040
but also adding tutoring, high intensity tutoring

49:05.040 --> 49:10.040
and small group work in those additional areas of time,

49:10.120 --> 49:12.760
both during the school day and beyond those

49:12.760 --> 49:16.360
can dramatically improve performance.

49:16.360 --> 49:18.480
We know that enthusiastic engagement

49:18.480 --> 49:21.840
in thoughtful minds on hands on curriculum

49:21.840 --> 49:25.280
that is focused on things that are relevant

49:25.280 --> 49:28.280
and engaging for students makes a big difference.

49:28.280 --> 49:32.840
We did put out digital guidance that identified

49:32.840 --> 49:37.320
for math and ELA, the power standards, if you will,

49:37.320 --> 49:41.520
and ways to engage students in critical learning

49:41.520 --> 49:43.640
in each of the grades,

49:43.640 --> 49:46.080
drawing on our common core standards,

49:46.080 --> 49:50.560
but really with a fine tune

49:50.560 --> 49:53.080
on how to integrate technology supports

49:53.080 --> 49:58.080
around how to use power standards to dive deeply

49:58.280 --> 50:01.320
in how to engage students critically.

50:01.320 --> 50:02.720
And then the last thing that we know

50:02.720 --> 50:05.240
really makes a difference is being in an environment,

50:05.240 --> 50:08.520
a positive climate in which students are experiencing

50:08.520 --> 50:10.560
a sense of safety and trust.

50:10.560 --> 50:14.400
And we see in the search on social emotional learning

50:14.400 --> 50:17.800
and restorative practices that when those elements are there,

50:17.800 --> 50:19.240
student achievement goes up

50:19.240 --> 50:21.600
because we use our brains more effectively

50:21.600 --> 50:23.200
when we're in those kinds of environments.

50:23.200 --> 50:25.720
So we're investing in all of those areas.

50:25.720 --> 50:29.600
And I gave a little bit of the national perspective

50:29.600 --> 50:31.680
from the NAEP tests yesterday,

50:32.840 --> 50:36.960
and we have lost less ground than most states

50:36.960 --> 50:38.800
and then the national average,

50:38.800 --> 50:43.800
as I noted, we maintained in eighth grade

50:44.320 --> 50:45.760
English language arts.

50:45.760 --> 50:48.760
Another study just came out in the last couple of days,

50:48.760 --> 50:51.400
I think it came out last Friday

50:51.400 --> 50:54.080
and was reported on on Monday

50:54.120 --> 50:56.560
from my colleagues, John Reardon at Stanford

50:56.560 --> 51:00.080
who has a database of all of the districts in the country

51:00.080 --> 51:02.240
and all of their progress and so on.

51:02.240 --> 51:06.800
And he made the point about these learning

51:06.800 --> 51:09.920
lags across the country and showed the relationship

51:09.920 --> 51:14.920
between student poverty and gains.

51:16.240 --> 51:20.360
And nationally, we see that districts

51:20.360 --> 51:22.920
that serve wealthier, more affluent students

51:22.960 --> 51:26.800
lost less ground generally than districts

51:26.800 --> 51:29.720
that serve more low-income students.

51:29.720 --> 51:32.200
And certainly we've seen the disparities

51:32.200 --> 51:35.680
in access to resources in this state,

51:35.680 --> 51:39.720
but we also have different outcomes than most states

51:39.720 --> 51:43.440
in that we have large districts

51:43.440 --> 51:46.880
that serve large numbers of low-income students,

51:46.880 --> 51:49.720
students of color, like Los Angeles and San Diego

51:49.720 --> 51:52.680
that I mentioned were high performers on the NAEP

51:53.560 --> 51:56.640
and gained places like Oakland and Compton

51:56.640 --> 52:00.720
and Salinas and others actually showed some stability

52:00.720 --> 52:02.800
and gains during this period of time.

52:02.800 --> 52:05.160
And I think that's because our funds went out

52:05.160 --> 52:09.560
not only in quantity for these purposes, $24 billion,

52:09.560 --> 52:12.600
but also with a very strong equity focus,

52:12.600 --> 52:16.440
trying to be sure that the resources get to the students

52:16.440 --> 52:18.560
and the districts that need them the most.

52:18.560 --> 52:20.960
So we have a big job to do.

52:20.960 --> 52:23.360
We are all focused on that job.

52:23.360 --> 52:26.920
I think we should continue to study what's working,

52:26.920 --> 52:30.240
what's not working and also redouble our efforts

52:30.240 --> 52:33.080
and these data are critically important in that.

52:34.120 --> 52:38.120
We can ask at this time any clarifying questions for Mal

52:38.120 --> 52:42.280
about points of fact that she raised

52:42.280 --> 52:43.960
and then we'll get public comment,

52:43.960 --> 52:46.760
then we'll come back for further discussion.

52:46.800 --> 52:51.800
Are there any clarifying questions?

52:54.560 --> 52:56.160
Yes, member Petillo-Bronson.

52:58.200 --> 53:03.200
So the item for action is actually,

53:04.200 --> 53:08.040
I think all focused on the California Spanish assessment.

53:08.040 --> 53:11.640
I also just wanted to confirm that this would be a moment

53:11.640 --> 53:15.560
to discuss the redesign possibilities more broadly

53:15.560 --> 53:18.880
that was sort of flagged, but it's not for action today.

53:18.880 --> 53:19.720
Is that right?

53:20.960 --> 53:22.440
Yes, we can discuss that.

53:22.440 --> 53:24.600
We'll get to the discussion, absolutely.

53:24.600 --> 53:27.400
And I'm glad to know that you have some ideas on that score.

53:27.400 --> 53:29.560
So we'll look forward to that.

53:29.560 --> 53:31.400
Member Rodriguez.

53:31.400 --> 53:32.240
Yes, thank you.

53:32.240 --> 53:35.600
And thank you Mal for the incredible presentation

53:35.600 --> 53:36.440
this morning.

53:37.720 --> 53:41.640
Wanted to find out like in lieu of the Spanish assessment

53:41.640 --> 53:43.800
that's going to be developed,

53:43.840 --> 53:48.760
students have been able to use IB scores, AP scores,

53:48.760 --> 53:51.240
and other language classes, right?

53:51.240 --> 53:56.000
So they still have access to the seal of biliteracy.

53:57.680 --> 53:59.240
Okay, thank you.

54:02.200 --> 54:05.400
And I guess the companion question might be

54:05.400 --> 54:07.640
whether they would continue to have access

54:07.640 --> 54:09.680
to multiple measures that they could use

54:09.680 --> 54:13.080
to meet the expectations of the seal of biliteracy.

54:14.800 --> 54:19.800
After this redesigned exam is available.

54:21.400 --> 54:24.840
That may be something we need to take up in our discussion.

54:24.840 --> 54:26.720
Member Patillo-Bronson.

54:26.720 --> 54:30.640
Sorry, second question unrelated to the first.

54:34.040 --> 54:39.040
The data that you described around more bright spots

54:39.760 --> 54:42.800
around eighth grade ELA scores or ELA,

54:44.280 --> 54:47.840
excuse me, as it pertains to the NAEP data.

54:47.840 --> 54:52.840
I just wondered if Mal could comment on sort of

54:53.080 --> 54:57.000
how to interpret what looks like a more promising trend

54:57.000 --> 55:00.320
for eighth grade ELA along the NAEP dimension

55:00.320 --> 55:02.000
versus the CASP.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.120
And if that's something that is normally,

55:04.120 --> 55:07.720
there's some sort of distance between how those two measures

55:08.680 --> 55:11.640
sort of evaluate student progress.

55:14.280 --> 55:18.120
Yeah, they're really two different sets of standards.

55:18.120 --> 55:23.120
NAEP is our only national assessment

55:23.560 --> 55:25.320
that every state participates in.

55:25.320 --> 55:28.000
It's a sampling of students.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.160
So the approach and the administration

55:30.160 --> 55:32.040
is a little bit different.

55:32.040 --> 55:37.040
I wasn't really, I didn't have any data handy right now

55:38.040 --> 55:41.640
about comparing our results to NAEP right now,

55:41.640 --> 55:45.320
but I don't know if our president wanted to say anything.

55:45.320 --> 55:46.800
I was just concentrating

55:46.800 --> 55:49.040
on our statewide assessments this morning.

55:53.000 --> 55:56.560
What we just showed, what Mal just shared with us

55:56.560 --> 55:58.960
did not break it down by grade level.

55:58.960 --> 56:02.440
In the guide that Mal described,

56:02.440 --> 56:07.040
there is a scale score trends by grade level.

56:07.040 --> 56:09.040
And we can look at that.

56:09.040 --> 56:12.200
I'll look at it before we come back for discussion,

56:12.200 --> 56:14.400
but I believe that eighth graders also

56:15.480 --> 56:20.000
did not lose as much of the loss or learning lag,

56:20.000 --> 56:23.760
if you wanna use that term, was in the earlier grades.

56:24.680 --> 56:28.040
And you see bigger learning lags

56:28.040 --> 56:31.600
for the youngest students.

56:31.600 --> 56:34.640
So we could compare eighth grade to eighth grade

56:34.640 --> 56:36.720
if we look at different data,

56:36.880 --> 56:39.720
which is not, it's all folded up together

56:39.720 --> 56:42.160
on the data that Mal was just describing.

56:43.440 --> 56:47.000
I see several people with clarifying questions.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.760
Member Escobedo, then member Yoshimoto-Towry,

56:49.760 --> 56:50.960
then member Olken.

56:52.640 --> 56:54.560
And maybe Tony Alpert.

56:54.560 --> 56:57.560
We do wanna get to public comment

56:57.560 --> 56:58.960
before we have deep discussions.

56:58.960 --> 57:03.000
So let's just be sure we keep these two clarifying questions.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.160
Member Escobedo.

57:04.160 --> 57:07.960
With the clarifying question and Nate versus our scores,

57:07.960 --> 57:10.560
I was just wondering, I just found

57:10.560 --> 57:13.680
as I compare standards from other states,

57:13.680 --> 57:17.360
California standards typically are much more rigorous.

57:17.360 --> 57:19.120
So that might be an explanation

57:19.120 --> 57:22.360
of why there might be just a difference.

57:22.360 --> 57:24.040
Yeah, that is true.

57:24.040 --> 57:28.000
We have both more rigorous standards and higher cut scores

57:28.000 --> 57:29.480
for our proficiency levels.

57:30.640 --> 57:32.000
Member Yoshimoto-Towry.

57:34.480 --> 57:35.320
Thank you.

57:35.320 --> 57:37.800
I understand now why we call these mega items.

57:37.800 --> 57:40.600
So I'm gonna limit my clarifying questions

57:40.600 --> 57:44.200
just to the Spanish, the item for up for action today.

57:44.200 --> 57:46.080
But I do have three very quick ones.

57:46.080 --> 57:48.400
The first one, Mal, is do we have an extent

57:48.400 --> 57:50.960
of the field test for 23, 24?

57:50.960 --> 57:54.120
Yeah, like when it'll take place and who's included?

57:54.120 --> 57:57.080
I saw in the literature that there's about 300 students,

57:57.080 --> 57:58.720
ideally, for each grade level.

58:00.520 --> 58:02.360
Are you talking about the NAEP?

58:02.400 --> 58:04.320
No, the Spanish language.

58:04.320 --> 58:09.320
Oh, in terms, no, I don't have that handy.

58:10.240 --> 58:13.960
Let me get that in terms of the field testing.

58:13.960 --> 58:15.040
Yes, I don't have that handy.

58:15.040 --> 58:16.960
I will get that from my staff.

58:16.960 --> 58:18.320
That's okay as a follow-up, thank you.

58:18.320 --> 58:22.240
And then the second question is do we,

58:22.240 --> 58:24.760
will there be sample questions written

58:24.760 --> 58:28.960
for the Spanish language assessment like we have eventually?

58:29.360 --> 58:34.360
We do already have the practice and training tests.

58:35.240 --> 58:37.600
So that's available publicly.

58:38.520 --> 58:42.080
But in terms of the expanded, like the speaking

58:42.080 --> 58:47.080
and the expanded writing expansion,

58:47.200 --> 58:49.120
I'm sure that we will always provide

58:49.120 --> 58:51.160
as part of the development process,

58:51.160 --> 58:54.520
sample items out there for the field to refer to.

58:54.520 --> 58:55.360
Thank you.

58:55.360 --> 58:58.880
And then my last, again, brief clarifying question is,

58:59.800 --> 59:03.280
in the speaking section when the student's speaking

59:03.280 --> 59:08.280
is recorded, is it using headphones or is it one-on-one?

59:09.120 --> 59:12.600
How is that, what's that process being explored?

59:13.760 --> 59:15.760
Well, now the only assessment we have

59:15.760 --> 59:19.800
that assesses speaking is in the LPAC, right?

59:19.800 --> 59:21.640
The English Language Proficiency Test.

59:21.640 --> 59:25.360
And in that, I believe it is recorded,

59:25.360 --> 59:29.200
what's in person, the teacher listens and then scores,

59:29.200 --> 59:31.680
but it's also recorded as well.

59:31.680 --> 59:36.680
So just for read-behind purposes,

59:36.720 --> 59:39.120
but we have those capabilities.

59:40.640 --> 59:44.880
So we're thinking about the speaking portion of the CSA

59:44.880 --> 59:46.840
to be similar to how we do the LPAC?

59:48.080 --> 59:50.680
No, at this point, it's not defined yet.

59:50.680 --> 59:52.960
I was just referring to a similar test

59:52.960 --> 59:54.680
that we have that would have speaking,

59:54.680 --> 59:56.800
but those would probably be options.

59:56.800 --> 01:00:00.400
But in terms of the specifics for administration,

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:04.520
those specific directions will still be in the works.

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.720
So if I speak prematurely,

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.680
those are probably various options,

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:11.320
but it will be more defined in the future.

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.040
Thank you, thank you.

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:15.360
And before I go to member Olken,

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:17.840
I think Tony Alpert had raised his hand

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.120
because he wanted to respond

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:21.000
to one of the clarifying questions earlier.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.560
Is that right, Tony?

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.280
Yes, thank you.

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:25.600
For the record, Tony Alpert,

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:28.440
Executive Director for Smarter Balanced.

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:33.320
In addition to the factual representation

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:36.120
that California standards are more rigorous

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:37.960
than other states,

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:42.880
the Smarter Balanced Assessment is a ELA literacy test,

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.040
which includes, as you're aware,

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:48.240
listening and research and writing.

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.640
NAEP is a reading test.

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:53.560
So in part, what we need to do

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:55.280
is dig in a little bit deeper

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:59.200
on some of these other dimensions of ELA,

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:00.200
especially writing.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.800
So I suspect that,

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:07.320
whereas reading probably was more sustained

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.600
during the pandemic,

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:12.400
writing probably fell a little bit astray,

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:16.200
and that might be why we're seeing differential results

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.960
between NAEP and Smarter Balanced.

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.040
Thank you.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:21.880
Member Olken.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:24.720
Thank you.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:27.240
Thank you for all the analysis

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:32.240
and both here and in the interpretation guide.

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:35.080
It's very helpful and I really appreciate it.

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:38.600
My clarifying question is just,

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.160
I noticed in the slides and in my,

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:42.640
jeez, sorry,

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:47.640
and in my quick perusal of the interpretation guide,

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:52.600
I don't see a similar analysis.

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:57.600
So we have the ELA and math percentage of students

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.320
met or exceeded standards by grade level

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:02.720
and then by subgroups.

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:08.360
Is there an analysis that is at the lowest level?

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:11.760
So it's like from 2019 to 2022,

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:14.400
the percentage of students who are at far below

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:20.360
so that we can see how that's changed over time.

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:24.160
Because when I'm thinking about the acceleration,

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:25.120
learning acceleration,

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.840
that's a group that feels really important to be addressing.

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:30.000
So I'm just wondering if that analysis has been done

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.040
and if not, if it can be for us.

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:34.360
I will address that,

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:37.760
that all those specific results are available

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:39.760
in the public reporting side.

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:43.520
So by each of the achievement levels is already there.

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.560
We were just taking some of the high level

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:48.880
or key points of the results to share with you.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:51.760
But if you go to the link that I provided

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:55.880
in the interpretation guide is also there as well.

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:58.360
When you are on the public reporting side,

01:02:58.360 --> 01:02:59.960
you could get all the details,

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:02.200
like how many students are tested at each level,

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:05.120
how many students are at each performance level,

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:08.760
across the grades, across the various groupings.

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.720
Okay, and it's rolled up in a similar way

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:14.040
to make it easy to see just like this.

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:14.960
That's right.

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:16.400
Fantastic, thank you.

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.840
Yeah, you're welcome.

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.320
It looks like Tony, do you have your hand up again?

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:23.720
Or is that from before?

01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:26.120
I do, thank you.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:30.600
And I really appreciate California's transparency

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:33.080
around public reporting.

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:38.080
I think it's also really important to look at the students

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:42.800
at the lowest level of performance by group,

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.800
demographics and program participation

01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:49.360
because the strategies that districts will need to use

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:53.280
will be different regarding their needs

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:56.440
to accelerate those all students learning.

01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:58.920
Absolutely.

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:02.760
The other thing I would just say is we're dealing,

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:06.760
digging into the needs in the field

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:10.440
is that you get a broad sense from scores

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.960
like the end of the year test in Smarter Balanced,

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:17.960
but there are also interim assessment tools

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:20.400
that are part of Smarter Balanced

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:24.640
and other diagnostic tools that districts are using.

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:26.600
Those are really what get activated

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:27.880
at the beginning of the school year

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:29.520
when you're trying to figure out

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:33.880
exactly what a student needs and knows and needs

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:36.400
in the next coming months.

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.720
Seeing no other clarifying questions,

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:41.400
I think we should move to public comment

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:44.000
and let's see if we have any public comment.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.560
Yes, there are currently six callers in the queue.

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:49.120
I will open up the phone line now.

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:50.880
Good morning, State Board of Education.

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.760
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:54.920
You have one minute, your time starts now.

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:05.720
Caller ending in the last four digits, 8256.

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:06.640
You are now live.

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:08.240
Please start your public comment.

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:11.720
Okay, moving on.

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:16.480
Caller with the last four digits, 5116.

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.280
Please start your public comment now.

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:25.560
Good morning, Jessica Sacco on behalf of Children Now.

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:28.880
I wanna thank the department for sharing their plans

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:33.400
for the upcoming year in regards to how they plan

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:35.760
to revise the student score reports

01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:38.480
to better communicate with families.

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:40.120
We really think it's critically important

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:43.520
to help families understand how well their student is doing

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:46.720
and inclusion of information such as recent progress

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:49.040
can be a critical step in helping families

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:51.240
support the student meet the state standards

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:54.240
and eventually graduate college and career ready.

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:57.360
One of the important pieces of information

01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:00.320
that was left out of the student score reports

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.800
are the claim scores that are no longer available

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:05.960
due to the abbreviated blueprint.

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:09.080
Those claim scores include information in language art

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:12.760
such as separate scores for reading, writing, listening,

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.560
and research and inquiry.

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:16.760
That detailed information at the student level

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:19.440
is really helpful for students and families

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:23.040
so that they can target the support that their child needs.

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:27.960
Currently, they are only available at the group level,

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:30.520
which is not very useful for families.

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:34.320
We would also encourage the use of comparison data points,

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.960
visuals on your progress,

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.600
as well as additional information

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:42.120
to help families understand Lexile and Quantile scores

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:44.200
and how they may access resources

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:47.080
to support students consistent with their level.

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:51.320
And we look forward to helping the department

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:53.800
engage with parents and families and communities

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.880
in order to inform the development

01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:57.840
of the next iteration of student score reports.

01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:59.920
Thank you, Callie, your time is up.

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:01.080
Next caller, please state your name

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:02.240
and affiliation for the record.

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:04.400
You have one minute, your time starts now.

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.600
Good morning, Liz Guillen with Public Advocates

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.600
for the LCFF Coalition.

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:19.720
Yes, appreciate the data that's presented on test scores

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:24.720
and also appreciate the positive words about the results.

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:30.280
So the community and various student groups that are lagging

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:33.480
that were lagging even before the pandemic,

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:37.480
these results are catastrophic.

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:40.160
And it's not even clear whether or not our students

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.360
will have the time to catch up.

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:47.360
For me, it highlights what we have been asking for

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:51.360
both at the legislature and through the department.

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:54.360
For greater transparency in the use of these funds.

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:57.360
The first report on the use of the learning recovery block

01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:01.360
grant is December, 2024.

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:05.360
And we urge and beg the department to require

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:09.360
more transparency about who's being consulted

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:10.360
on the use of these funds.

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:12.360
Thank you, thank you, your time is up.

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:13.360
In addition to it.

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:16.360
Next caller, please state your name

01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:17.360
and affiliation for the record.

01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:19.360
You have one minute, your time starts now.

01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:21.360
Hi, this is Doug McRae,

01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:24.360
a retired testing specialist from Monterey.

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:28.360
I'm going to do quickly two things, item six and item 12

01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:31.360
since I was not successful with six.

01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:34.360
For item six on the consent yesterday,

01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:37.360
I submitted to your electronic folder

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:40.360
a concern over overpayments to DTS

01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:43.360
in the 2020 and 2020 budget.

01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:46.360
I'm going to do quickly two things,

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:49.360
a concern over overpayments to DTS

01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:53.360
in the 2020 and 2021 testing cycles,

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:55.360
receiving a fully budgeted amount

01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:58.360
rather than a cost reimbursement amount.

01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:03.360
I estimated the overpayments to be $123 million.

01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:05.360
There will be several ways for ETS

01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:09.360
to return those dollars to California.

01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:10.360
For item number 12,

01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:12.360
I submitted to your electronic folder,

01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:14.360
a preliminary version of four-page

01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:16.360
smarter balance concessions

01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:18.360
concessions concessions wide

01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:20.360
gains Gordai data document

01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:23.360
with results from 10 of 11 states.

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:27.360
Bottom line is that the gains from 2021 to 2022

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:29.360
were very positive,

01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:31.360
justifying claims by state leaders.

01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:33.360
They were headed in the right direction.

01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:36.360
Be happy to provide additional information

01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:38.360
for both item six and 12.

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:39.360
Thank you.

01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:40.360
Thank you.

01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:41.360
Next caller, please state your name

01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:42.360
and affiliation for the record.

01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:43.360
You have one minute.

01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:44.360
Your time starts now.

01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:51.360
Hi, this is Manuel Vendroso,

01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:53.360
Associate Director of Policy

01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:55.360
of California's Together.

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:56.360
We first want to thank the board

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:57.360
and CDU for reviewing

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.360
how assessment results are reported

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.360
to students and families

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:03.360
and appreciate the plan

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:06.360
to make the future understanding more accessible.

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:07.360
For the report for the

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:09.360
English language proficiency assessment,

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:11.360
we recommend that these clearly display

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:14.360
whether a student is making adequate progress

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:17.360
over time towards English proficiency

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.360
and whether a student is at risk

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:21.360
what has become a long-coming disarmament.

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:23.360
Further, the current report

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:26.360
on the alternative ALPAC assessment

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:28.360
lacks the clarity provided

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:30.360
in the standard ALPAC report,

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:33.360
and we recommend making it easier to understand.

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:35.360
Lastly, we are grateful for the board and CDU

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.360
as we continue to implement

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:39.360
the California Spanish assessment,

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.360
and thank them for continuing to engage our coalition

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:43.360
and we can put in discussions.

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:46.360
The CFA is a key aspect of California's efforts

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:48.360
to expand students' languages

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:49.360
and we're hoping we'll listen.

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:50.360
Thank you.

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:51.360
Thank you.

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.360
Next caller, please state your name

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:53.360
and affiliation for the record.

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:54.360
You have one minute.

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:55.360
Your time starts now.

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:00.360
Hi, Peter Ahern,

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:02.360
California Association of Science Educators

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:03.360
speaking on behalf of the

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.360
Coalition of Science Educators

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.360
and organizations who submitted a letter

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:08.360
to explain our thoughts in detail.

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:10.360
We have been working together to advance

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:12.360
equity in science education throughout California

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:14.360
and shared our blueprint in the letter.

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.360
We are grateful to CDE for the work

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.360
in building the science tools for teachers

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:20.360
and working with teachers in building this resource.

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:23.360
We look forward to helping CDE to expand and promote.

01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:25.360
We also would like to thank CDE

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:27.360
for its hard work in getting science data

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:28.360
linked to this year's dashboard.

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:30.360
The scores indicate that districts

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:32.360
have still not invested in science

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:34.360
and in GSS implementation.

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:35.360
They are not likely to do so

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:37.360
until science is included on the main dashboard.

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.360
We are grateful for the support that

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:41.360
the State Board of Education has given

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:43.360
to including science as a dashboard indicator

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:46.360
once two consecutive years of data are available

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:49.360
and look forward to science being on the next week.

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:51.360
Having a strong science education for all students

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:53.360
is vital to provide full access

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:55.360
to STEM career pathways.

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:57.360
It is also critical that California has a

01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:59.360
science literate workforce and citizenry.

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:02.360
Thank you.

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.360
Next caller, please state your name

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:06.360
and affiliation for the record.

01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:08.360
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:13.360
Hi. Good morning.

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.360
My name is Dr. Rosario Moreno.

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:17.360
I'm the Director of Parent Relations

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:19.360
for California Association of Bilingual Education,

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:21.360
School Administrator and University Professor.

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:23.360
Share with you that in Alameda County,

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:25.360
only one school district out of 18

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:27.360
had to include a goal for English learners in the LCAP.

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:29.360
Keep in mind that the county enrolls

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.360
43,020 English learners in only one district

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:33.360
or 5% of the districts needs to address

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.360
the growth of English language proficiency

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:37.360
for the students.

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:39.360
The accountability system only identifies

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:41.360
two districts or 10% out of 18

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:43.360
are eligible for additional support

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:45.360
to differentiated assistance.

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:47.360
The issue of transparency,

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:49.360
addressing principle 6 speaks to the need

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:51.360
to shed light on language and academic needs

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.360
of English learners.

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:55.360
I think we would all agree that in the number

01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:57.360
of English learners in Alameda County,

01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:59.360
the accountability system

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:01.360
Excuse me.

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.360
I apologize. I think you want to be calling back

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:05.360
for the following item.

01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:07.360
This is requiring our statewide assessment

01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:09.360
results. I think you want to call in for the next item.

01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:13.360
Okay. Thank you.

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:15.360
That concludes public comment

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:17.360
for item number 12.

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:21.360
Alright. Thank you very much.

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:23.360
We're now open for board discussion

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:25.360
on this item.

01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:29.360
And I know that member Yoshimoto

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:31.360
Tari, you had an additional

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.360
area of inquiry

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.360
that you were holding

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:37.360
for discussion.

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:39.360
Vice President Glover Woods,

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:41.360
you ready to jump in?

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:45.360
Yes, I sure can.

01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:47.360
First, again, thank you so much, Mal,

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:49.360
for always giving such a wonderful

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:51.360
presentation and outlining all of the things

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.360
regarding assessment and quite

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:55.360
excited to see the development

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:57.360
for the California Spanish assessment.

01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:59.360
I just wanted to

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:01.360
underscore a couple of

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.360
pieces and also make a

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.360
request. As was

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:07.360
stated, the data

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:09.360
that we were looking at with the SBAT

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.360
should be for

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:13.360
2022 considered baseline

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:15.360
and I agree. I think it's important

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.360
to look back at what has

01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:19.360
occurred and how the

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:21.360
pandemic has impacted instruction.

01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:23.360
I also believe that we are now

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:25.360
in 2022, in the

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.360
2022-23 school year, and we need

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:29.360
to look at the data

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:31.360
where it is and make some

01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:33.360
actionable

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:35.360
steps forward to make

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:37.360
some adjustments. And saying so,

01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:39.360
I am concerned about

01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:41.360
the scores that we are

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:43.360
looking at and that have been shown

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:45.360
for our African American student

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:47.360
group as well as our English

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:49.360
learner student group.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:51.360
So I encourage both at the state level

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:53.360
and also at the local LEA level that we

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:55.360
do some further desegregation

01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:57.360
of those student groups

01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:59.360
to see

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:01.360
other information that might be

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:03.360
illuminated in the data once

01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:05.360
we look at

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:07.360
those student groups in a bit more

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:09.360
of a fine-tune, if you

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:11.360
will. Also, just

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:13.360
want to highlight President

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:15.360
Darling-Hammond really outlined

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:17.360
some very key

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:19.360
accelerating learning strategies

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:21.360
and actions that we need to

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:23.360
keep in mind as we look at

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:25.360
the utilization of the funds that

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:27.360
have been put forward. And

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:29.360
just really, again, looking forward

01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:31.360
from where we are now to what needs

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.360
to happen. Because the data

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:35.360
really shows that

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:37.360
those gaps that were present before

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.360
the pandemic for multiple student

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:41.360
groups still do exist.

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:43.360
And I just strongly

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.360
encourage all of us, those in

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.360
the field as well as those of us on the board,

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:49.360
to look at what are those strategies

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:51.360
we need to use to

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:53.360
close those gaps and bring our other

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:55.360
student groups forward. Thank you.

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:57.360
Thank you.

01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:59.360
Member Petillo-Bronson,

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:01.360
Member Rodriguez.

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:07.360
Good morning and thank

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:09.360
you, Mao, again, for the presentation

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:11.360
which was very, very helpful

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:13.360
and as always

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.360
brings to light lots of

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:17.360
important trend lines.

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.360
So I guess

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:21.360
the first set of comments really is just around

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:23.360
what our vice

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:25.360
chair was just describing of wanting

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:27.360
to keep an

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:29.360
eye on both where

01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:31.360
the pandemic exacerbated versus

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:33.360
created new gaps

01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:35.360
that didn't exist before.

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:37.360
And this is not

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:39.360
something that I necessarily expect

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:41.360
today's presentation

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:43.360
to solve, but I do think

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:45.360
I'm trying to think about

01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.360
what is the role of the state board

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:49.360
in both being able

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:51.360
to disaggregate

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:53.360
not just data, but which

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:55.360
intervention strategies

01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:57.360
are most impactful

01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:59.360
in actually

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:01.360
reaching different student groups

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.360
and different disparities numbers.

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:05.360
So I'm

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:07.360
delighted and relieved

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:09.360
to see some acceleration

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:11.360
of learning patterns and catch-up

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.360
and also expecting

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:15.360
that there'll be some

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:17.360
differential progress as between

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:19.360
if it's tutoring or after school or summer

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:21.360
that shows

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:23.360
progress for different student groups.

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:25.360
And I'm not sure if

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:27.360
the CASC data can get us

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:29.360
there, but I'm putting it on

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:31.360
sort of our list of things

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:33.360
to think about for the future

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:35.360
for

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:37.360
making sure that we're

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.360
lifting all boats, but also recognizing

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.360
that different

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:43.360
boats have different levels of buoyancy

01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:45.360
coming into it.

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.360
So the

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:49.360
second thing that I wanted to raise

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:51.360
up was the

01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:53.360
issue of redesign and

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:55.360
the calendar that you shared moving

01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:57.360
forward. I'm sort of picking

01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:59.360
up on the prior conversation

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:01.360
that we had

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:03.360
at the last board or maybe

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:05.360
two board meetings ago around

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:07.360
whether and how

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:09.360
to create space

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:11.360
for school

01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:13.360
averages, district averages,

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.360
and statewide averages

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:17.360
to be included for

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.360
information that's available to parents

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:21.360
on the score reports.

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:23.360
I think we had

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:25.360
you had shared in the last meeting that there's

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:27.360
sort of a time delay between the time

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:29.360
available for

01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:31.360
individual scores to go

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:33.360
home to families versus

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:35.360
when the

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:37.360
averages would be made available.

01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:39.360
So I wanted to first ask if there's any

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:41.360
update about being able to align

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:43.360
those

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:45.360
to be able to actually

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:47.360
provide those averages to parents

01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:49.360
and if

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:51.360
there is a technical challenge

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:53.360
that makes

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:55.360
the creation of those district-wide

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:57.360
and state and school-wide averages

01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:59.360
challenging if

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:01.360
we can include prior

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.360
year averages.

01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:09.360
I could

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:11.360
say a little bit about that.

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:13.360
Please do, yes.

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:15.360
With

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:17.360
it is always our intent

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:19.360
to include them.

01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:21.360
It's just that at this point the data

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:23.360
is not available due to

01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:25.360
the suspension in prior

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.360
years, right, 2020-21.

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:29.360
So we

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:31.360
didn't have enough

01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:33.360
data to report and that is why we

01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:35.360
were excluding them from the current

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:37.360
year one, but through the process of

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:39.360
redesign this year, we can

01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:41.360
certainly continue to look at

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.360
that and as

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:45.360
we progress and more years of data

01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:47.360
are available, we can

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:49.360
put

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:51.360
as much information as

01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:53.360
reasonable on

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.360
the student score

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:57.360
reports, including this, or with

01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:59.360
a lot of technology advancement

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:01.360
then we could

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:03.360
probably find better ways of getting data

01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:05.360
to students and parents in even

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:07.360
more timely, in a more timely

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:09.360
manner and provide more data

01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:11.360
and information as well. So we

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:13.360
look forward to your feedback and we have

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:15.360
this as on our bucket list of

01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:17.360
continuing to do

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:19.360
and pursue, so I appreciate

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:21.360
you bringing it up.

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:23.360
Thank you.

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:25.360
Member Rodriguez and then

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:27.360
member Yoshimoto-Tari.

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:29.360
Thank you.

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:31.360
So first

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:33.360
of all, I'd like to thank our liaisons.

01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:35.360
Member Orozco

01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:37.360
and President Darlene

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:39.360
Hammond on your

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:41.360
the way you

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:43.360
framed

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:45.360
first of all, shout

01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:47.360
out to teacher-led

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:49.360
practices.

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:51.360
Thank you so much for that because

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:53.360
that's important, right, for us to have

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:55.360
we know our students

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:57.360
and

01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:59.360
and for us to help each other

01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:01.360
help our students

01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:03.360
grow is so important

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:05.360
and also

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:07.360
President

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:09.360
Darlene Hammond, you mentioned

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:11.360
a lot of the

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:13.360
funds that, you know, are going

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:15.360
into, that we've

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:17.360
committed to support

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.360
our students and

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:21.360
the social-emotional

01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:23.360
learning. One of

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:25.360
my concerns is also the concern

01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:27.360
that Vice President

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:29.360
Glover Woods raised,

01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:31.360
you know, are the students who

01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:33.360
just, they seem to be continuing

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.360
to fall

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:37.360
behind. And

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:39.360
my experience as a teacher for

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:41.360
25 years has

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:43.360
it seems like there's

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:45.360
a sociocultural

01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:47.360
component,

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:49.360
you know, where

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:51.360
I feel like

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:53.360
students have

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.360
been disengaged. You were mentioning

01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:57.360
engagement, right? They've been disengaged from the

01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:59.360
process and

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:01.360
you know, we really

01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:03.360
wanted to challenge them. We want to

01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:05.360
have them be in robust

01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:07.360
classes and give them

01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:09.360
the props so that they can be

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:11.360
successful. But the first

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:13.360
part is the engagement, right?

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:15.360
How do we make them

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:17.360
active participants in the

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:19.360
learning process in constructing

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:21.360
their learning? And so

01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:23.360
that's a question that

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:25.360
has come up for me

01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:27.360
many times and especially

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:29.360
looking at this data.

01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:31.360
You know, I want

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:33.360
to see our students continue to grow.

01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:35.360
And

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:37.360
so there's

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.360
the

01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:41.360
commitment that we have made as a

01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:43.360
state makes me

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:45.360
hopeful because

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.360
we have to, and then

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:49.360
we have to ensure that it's being

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:51.360
that the students who really need those

01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:53.360
supports, whether it's pull-out

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:55.360
interventions, the tutoring,

01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:57.360
right, if it's done well,

01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:59.360
and students

01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:01.360
have a chance to have feedback

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:03.360
with a person

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:05.360
who's supporting them.

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:07.360
Pulling

01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:09.360
students out, identifying students

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.360
that need that extra support is

01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:13.360
essential. And I also

01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:15.360
want to

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:17.360
comment on the seal

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:19.360
of biliteracy and

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:21.360
just what an impact that's had,

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.360
speaking of engagement, on a lot

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:25.360
of the students in my community

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:27.360
because

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:29.360
their language is being valued,

01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:31.360
right? You know, they feel like, yes, we

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:33.360
are bilingual

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:35.360
and students who maybe aren't

01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:37.360
bilingual yet, we're working towards that.

01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:39.360
And so

01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:41.360
that is

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:43.360
a wonderful tool

01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:45.360
for

01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:47.360
encouragement and engagement

01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:49.360
that we provide as a state.

01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:51.360
And

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.360
lastly, I want to comment also

01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:55.360
on, you know, the

01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:57.360
science and the importance of science.

01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:59.360
On Halloween,

01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:01.360
I started my class for the

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:03.360
first few minutes going over the history

01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:05.360
of vampires

01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:07.360
and,

01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:09.360
you know, and just how

01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:11.360
there were vampires in Mesopotamia

01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:13.360
and Greece, in Mexico,

01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:15.360
and oftentimes, you know, right, like in

01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:17.360
ancient civilizations,

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:19.360
they were used to explain phenomena,

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:21.360
natural phenomena.

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.360
But then, you know, when

01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:25.360
the vampire became big in

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.360
I believe it was Romania, Bulgaria,

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:29.360
it was

01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:31.360
to explain a pandemic. People were dying.

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:33.360
But they didn't know

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.360
about the science of death, right?

01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:37.360
And so

01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:39.360
I was telling my students and I,

01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:41.360
we were talking about the importance of science

01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:43.360
because as we learn

01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:45.360
more, we don't rely on

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:47.360
supernatural theories to explain

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:51.360
natural phenomena.

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.360
And they

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:55.360
were really excited.

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:57.360
They were like, science!

01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:59.360
And so anyway, yes, science

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:01.360
is so important.

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:03.360
You know, especially in this

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:05.360
era of disinformation,

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:07.360
when we go to the science,

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:09.360
we can, when we have that scientific

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:11.360
training, we're able to explain a lot more.

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:13.360
So thank you.

01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:15.360
Thanks so much.

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:17.360
Member Yoshimoto

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.360
Tauri.

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:21.360
Thank you, Board President.

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:23.360
I have some general comments on the information

01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:25.360
items and then a

01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:27.360
comment or just for discussion on the

01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:29.360
action item. So first,

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:31.360
our Board President and Vice President

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.360
did an excellent job in setting the stage

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:35.360
around the context for the

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:37.360
assessment. So I don't want to reiterate any

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:39.360
of that, but I did want to add that

01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:41.360
I think that

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:43.360
we learned a lot in the

01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:45.360
during the pandemic or now the

01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:47.360
endemic about how to

01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:49.360
use multi-tiered systems

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:51.360
of support to really be

01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:53.360
pronounced and explicit

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:55.360
about those, not only

01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:57.360
in academics, but in

01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:59.360
very human needs like mental

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:01.360
and physical well-being,

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:03.360
food sustenance, housing

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:05.360
support, as

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:07.360
well as remembering

01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:09.360
well-being, joy and connectedness

01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:11.360
and the importance of that.

01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:13.360
And never before in my

01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:15.360
30 years did I see

01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:17.360
not only educators, but

01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:19.360
maintenance and operation workers,

01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:21.360
librarians, principals, city staff,

01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:23.360
municipalities,

01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:25.360
frontline health care

01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:27.360
workers supporting one another

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:29.360
and being surrounded by private

01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:31.360
philanthropy and community-based

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:33.360
organizations. So I hope that we

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:35.360
take that with us in our recovery

01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:37.360
phase and use that to our benefit

01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:39.360
in the acceleration phase that

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:41.360
our educators

01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:43.360
want and need that support

01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:45.360
like we talked about yesterday in the

01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:47.360
community school effort

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:49.360
and wanted to

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:51.360
bring the community school effort into the context

01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:53.360
today as we think about our

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:55.360
recovery and our acceleration.

01:26:57.360 --> 01:26:59.360
In terms of science,

01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:01.360
I believe science is the place

01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:03.360
where reading comprehension gets applied,

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:05.360
mathematics gets applied,

01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:07.360
and true critical thinking

01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:09.360
and inquiry processes get applied.

01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:11.360
So I just want to commend the department

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:13.360
for working on the Tools for Teachers

01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:15.360
and those 70 mini lessons.

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:17.360
I think those are really important and I just

01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:19.360
wish that we can continue that work

01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:21.360
into next year.

01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:23.360
And then in terms of the last

01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:25.360
information item I wanted to address,

01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:27.360
again, gratitude to the CD staff

01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:29.360
for working with the SBA Consortium,

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:31.360
etc.

01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:33.360
And I just want to reiterate the

01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:35.360
importance of having the claim scores even

01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:37.360
though we're using the modified, more concise

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:39.360
smarter balance assessment

01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:41.360
and to reiterate Board Member Portillo

01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:43.360
Bronson's comments about the comparative

01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:45.360
data for parents and families.

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:47.360
I think that

01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:49.360
our students will benefit from our families,

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:51.360
our educators, our counselors

01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:53.360
understanding what specific

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.360
areas of support and instruction are

01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:57.360
needed. And

01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:59.360
the work on the focus IABs

01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:01.360
have been incredible, but I would ask

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:03.360
in next year's work plan that we include

01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:05.360
the shorter

01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:07.360
possibilities for a shorter

01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:09.360
ICA as well

01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:11.360
that matches the shorter summative

01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:13.360
because many schools want to

01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:15.360
use the ICA

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:17.360
as a formative assessment

01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:19.360
and then have multiple forms of that

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.360
ICA so they can do like a beginning

01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:23.360
and possibly a middle

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:25.360
before the summative to give

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:27.360
our educators

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:29.360
an opportunity to see growth over time.

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:31.360
And then finally

01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:33.360
for our Spanish language assessment,

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:35.360
Mal, I was just hoping in

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:37.360
a moment you could explain

01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:39.360
to us the process

01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:41.360
the department used to determine the

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:43.360
descriptors,

01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:49.360
and then also

01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:51.360
given that we're so early in the process

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:53.360
of the CSA development, the Spanish

01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:55.360
language assessment development, there's

01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:57.360
an opportunity to revisit and revise

01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:59.360
the descriptors even if we

01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:01.360
approve those today.

01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:03.360
And I'm asking primarily because

01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:05.360
I noticed that the one

01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:07.360
of the terms used is limited

01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:11.360
to a limited degree.

01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:13.360
And the

01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:15.360
first time, it just

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:17.360
reminds me of the term limited English

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:19.360
proficiency that we've tried so hard to move away

01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:21.360
from. And when limited

01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:23.360
English proficiency was first used, it was

01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:25.360
first used in 1975 associated

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:27.360
with Lau

01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:29.360
versus Nichols.

01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:31.360
And we've moved, we've moved, you know,

01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:33.360
we've grown a lot in the last four years

01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:35.360
in regard to our belief around

01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:37.360
assets-based language.

01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:39.360
Our

01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:41.360
students learning English and in this case

01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:43.360
our students learning Spanish

01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:45.360
bring other languages and other

01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:47.360
assets to the table.

01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:49.360
And so I

01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:51.360
just wondered about the process

01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:53.360
used to formulate the descriptors

01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:55.360
and if there's any room to possibly

01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:57.360
revisit those

01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:59.360
again, even if

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:01.360
approved today for

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:03.360
the immediate work plan.

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.360
Thank you.

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:07.360
So

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:09.360
lots of issues there.

01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:11.360
Tony raised his hand because I think he

01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:13.360
wants to answer one of your questions.

01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:15.360
And then Mao, if we can come to you

01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:17.360
for that last question.

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:19.360
Tony.

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:21.360
Thank you. For the record, Tony Alpert, Executive

01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:23.360
Director, Smarter Balanced.

01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:25.360
The

01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:27.360
reason why we can support a more

01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:29.360
concise blueprint on the

01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:31.360
summative test is because it's adaptive.

01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:33.360
If we look

01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:35.360
and similarly

01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:37.360
the blocks that we have

01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:39.360
in the interim assessment are focused

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:41.360
on a smaller body of content.

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:43.360
And so to

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:45.360
include the ICA,

01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:47.360
which mimics the blueprint

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:49.360
of the summative assessment

01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:51.360
and

01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:53.360
in a shortened manner,

01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:55.360
it would be a short fixed

01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:57.360
form, which would work for

01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:59.360
about this portion of the student

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:01.360
population. And so

01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:03.360
for most students, it would not

01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:05.360
be reliable. And certainly the

01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:07.360
claim information

01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:09.360
would be insufficient

01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:11.360
under any conditions

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:13.360
to report on that

01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:15.360
broad swat of content.

01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:17.360
So what

01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:19.360
we recommend is that

01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:21.360
if folks want to use

01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:23.360
the items

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:25.360
from the ICA, they can use the interim

01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:27.360
assessment item portal

01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:29.360
to create their own version

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:31.360
of an assessment

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:33.360
and using the items from

01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:35.360
Smarter Balanced. And that's

01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:37.360
available in Tools for Teachers. So

01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:39.360
they could link together

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:41.360
multiple IABs

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:43.360
and use that information

01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:45.360
as part of their

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:47.360
formative assessment process.

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:49.360
Thank

01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:51.360
you.

01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:53.360
We're going to come back in, I think,

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:55.360
January to talk also about the

01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:57.360
demonstration

01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:59.360
of content that the Smarter Balanced

01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:01.360
team has done

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:03.360
with bringing performance tasks

01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:05.360
into the

01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:07.360
school year. And some

01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:09.360
states are

01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:11.360
sort of piloting that with the idea

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:13.360
of using that also to develop

01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:15.360
claim scores that could be available

01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:17.360
for all students. So there's a lot of

01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:19.360
things to talk about there.

01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:21.360
Marianne, did you want

01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:23.360
to answer one of the questions? Is that why

01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:25.360
you're popping up, Marianne Arcila,

01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:27.360
our ETS representative?

01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:29.360
Yes. For the record,

01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:31.360
hello, everyone.

01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:33.360
Good morning, board members. My name is Marianne

01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:35.360
Arcila, executive director at ETS.

01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:37.360
We serve

01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:39.360
as a state testing contractor.

01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:41.360
I wanted to respond

01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:43.360
about the process

01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:45.360
for the

01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:47.360
descriptors.

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:49.360
And so

01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:51.360
the CSA has

01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:53.360
been around for a few years

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:55.360
now, and at the very beginning

01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:57.360
there was a multi-step

01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:59.360
process to develop

01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:01.360
the descriptors.

01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:03.360
And for each process, for

01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:05.360
each state,

01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:07.360
we

01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:09.360
had teachers, we had educators

01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.360
come together

01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:13.360
to identify,

01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:15.360
to go through the standards, identify

01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:17.360
what

01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:19.360
a

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.360
student

01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:23.360
at each level

01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:25.360
should be able

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:27.360
to do or would know

01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:29.360
what they would know how to do.

01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:31.360
And then they helped

01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:33.360
draft the descriptors.

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:35.360
And so we did that

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:37.360
with educators at each stage

01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:39.360
and at each point

01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:41.360
we

01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:43.360
provided them to the CDE. CDE

01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:45.360
provided the recommendations.

01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:47.360
There were revisions

01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:49.360
when they were received by the CDE

01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:51.360
and the CDE provided

01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:53.360
the recommended descriptors to the

01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:55.360
state board for approval.

01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:57.360
With the addition

01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:59.360
of speaking

01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:01.360
and writing

01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:03.360
or for CSA, for this

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:05.360
expansion, we did something very

01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:07.360
similar.

01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:09.360
And then, and so that's

01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:11.360
the recommendations, the revised

01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:13.360
descriptors are what you're seeing now.

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:15.360
We ran them

01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:17.360
through a number of reviews

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:19.360
externally

01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:21.360
and then with the CDE and the CDE

01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:23.360
made the final recommendations

01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:25.360
that you're seeing today.

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:27.360
Hope that answers your question.

01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:29.360
I think that answers one part of the question.

01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:31.360
The other part was whether we can rethink

01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:33.360
the use of the term limited.

01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:35.360
For President, I

01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:37.360
could probably address that a little bit.

01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:39.360
And in addition to what Marianne said,

01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:41.360
we did vet these

01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:43.360
by our experts, as

01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:45.360
I mentioned when we worked on

01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:47.360
and educators as Marianne mentioned

01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:49.360
when they

01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:51.360
were first developed. So

01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:53.360
we can change the word at this time

01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:55.360
to something different like we did for

01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:57.360
LPAC. For example,

01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:59.360
we had beginning at that time

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:01.360
and then we changed it to

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:03.360
beginning instead of limited.

01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:05.360
So we are aware that that would probably

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:07.360
be a phrase we wouldn't want to use going

01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:09.360
forward. So thank you for bringing that

01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:11.360
up. And we are taking note

01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:13.360
of that. And during

01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:15.360
this process, we can certainly

01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:17.360
do that.

01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:19.360
Thanks so much. I

01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:21.360
have a question on the Spanish assessment too.

01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:23.360
Member Olken, are you

01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:25.360
on that same point or a different point?

01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:27.360
Okay, you go first.

01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:29.360
Thank you.

01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:31.360
So I was hoping to

01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:33.360
return to the question that got

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:35.360
briefly

01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:37.360
raised during our

01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:39.360
clarifying questions about

01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:41.360
the seal of biliteracy.

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:43.360
Once the

01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:47.360
that

01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:49.360
get my CSA

01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:51.360
is

01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:53.360
becomes

01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:55.360
a valid means

01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:57.360
to

01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:01.360
assess

01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:03.360
seal of biliteracy, there's a question

01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:05.360
whether the ways that students

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:07.360
currently are able to demonstrate

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:09.360
their biliteracy will still be

01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:11.360
available so that we have multiple

01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:13.360
measures. And I just wondered if

01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:15.360
that's something we thought

01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:17.360
if that's something that's being considered

01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:19.360
so that we

01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:21.360
could and if not

01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:23.360
maybe we could we.

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:25.360
Now, do you know the answer

01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:27.360
to that question?

01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:31.360
That's really a policy

01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:33.360
use question.

01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:35.360
I don't have an answer.

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:37.360
I'm sorry. I couldn't catch all of it because someone told

01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:39.360
me I was echoing.

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:41.360
My technology here.

01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:43.360
Yeah, and it sounds like

01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:45.360
perhaps maybe the

01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:47.360
it's more of a

01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:49.360
question to put out there

01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:51.360
more broadly than to you in particular.

01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:53.360
It may be a question for us.

01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:55.360
I think, you know, I would

01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:57.360
It's a question for us.

01:36:57.360 --> 01:36:59.360
I think I hear you

01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:03.360
affirming the value of having

01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:05.360
multiple ways of doing

01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:07.360
that. I believe that that is

01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:09.360
still going to be the case, but I'd love

01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:11.360
to be sure that that's the case so that

01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:13.360
students don't have to take

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:15.360
more tests than are needed

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:17.360
to be able to demonstrate their

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:19.360
competence. If they're taking AP

01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:21.360
Spanish, you know, and then that's

01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:23.360
one of the ways, you know, in then

01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:25.360
we should preserve that option as long

01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:27.360
as and other options

01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:29.360
that have been on the table.

01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:31.360
That's exactly what I was trying to say. Thank you.

01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:35.360
Vice President Glover Woods nodding.

01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:37.360
So I think I'm getting some

01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:39.360
sense of a sense. So I think we want to check into

01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:41.360
the fact, check into what the

01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:43.360
policy framework is for that and

01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:45.360
weigh in if there is any question about

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:47.360
that.

01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:49.360
I have just one last question about the blueprint.

01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:51.360
When I raised

01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:53.360
the notion about speaking,

01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:55.360
Mal, you said that that was not on

01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:57.360
the table, but I thought

01:37:57.360 --> 01:37:59.360
in the original slides I saw that

01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:01.360
right around slide eight or nine

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:03.360
that

01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:05.360
it did say that speaking

01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:07.360
was one of the domains along

01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:09.360
with could you go back to the

01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:11.360
in the slides unless they changed from the earlier

01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:13.360
slides I had seen previous

01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:15.360
to the meeting.

01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:17.360
Yes, speaking

01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:19.360
is hard.

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:21.360
Yes, I just couldn't get

01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:23.360
there fast enough.

01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:25.360
I'm in this room and there's a lot other noise.

01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:27.360
I don't know if you guys are getting some

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.360
feedback. We are. We are getting

01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:31.360
your feedback. It's

01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:33.360
lovely to hear your voice twice.

01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:37.360
Which is what we're hearing.

01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:39.360
So yeah, just to clarify

01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:41.360
that the proposed

01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:43.360
revised TSA general

01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:45.360
ALDs will add speaking

01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:47.360
to the general ALDs.

01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:49.360
They will

01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:51.360
include domains for

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:55.360
speaking as well

01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:57.360
as writing and

01:38:57.360 --> 01:38:59.360
reading.

01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:01.360
I'm not sure if listening is there, but

01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:03.360
that is something we

01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:05.360
talked about earlier as well.

01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:09.360
The overall scale score with three achievement

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:11.360
levels and reading, writing, listening and speaking

01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:13.360
domains was on

01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:15.360
slide 10.

01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:17.360
I'm happy about that.

01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:19.360
And

01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:21.360
that is the kind of

01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:23.360
blueprint we want to approve, I think.

01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:25.360
So at this point, I think we've

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:27.360
made all of our comments.

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.360
Take a motion if there is

01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:31.360
one to

01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:33.360
respond to the CDE recommendations

01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:35.360
and there they are again.

01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:37.360
May I get a motion?

01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:41.360
So moved.

01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:43.360
All right. Thank you.

01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:45.360
And second.

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:47.360
Thank you very much.

01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:49.360
Brooks, can you call the roll call vote?

01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:51.360
Apologies.

01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:53.360
We didn't catch who was the second.

01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:55.360
Member

01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:57.360
Orozco-Gonzalez.

01:39:57.360 --> 01:39:59.360
Thank you.

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:01.360
All right.

01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:03.360
President Darling-Hammond.

01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:05.360
Aye.

01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:07.360
Member Escobedo.

01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:09.360
Aye.

01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:11.360
Vice President Glover-Woods.

01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:13.360
Yes.

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:15.360
Member Lewis.

01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:17.360
Yes.

01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:19.360
Member McQuillan.

01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:21.360
Aye.

01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:23.360
Member Olken.

01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.360
Yes.

01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:27.360
Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:29.360
Yes.

01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:31.360
Member Petillo-Brownson.

01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:33.360
Yes.

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:35.360
Member Porter.

01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:37.360
Motion carries unanimously.

01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:39.360
Terrific.

01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:41.360
We are one minute ahead of schedule.

01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:43.360
So we will now take a 16 minute break

01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:45.360
and I will see you back at 10.45.

01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:47.360
Remember to

01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:49.360
stay in the meeting but turn off your

01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:51.360
video and your microphone.

01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:55.360
All right.

01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:57.360
Welcome back.

01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:59.360
Let's ask Brooks to call the roll to

01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:01.360
reestablish the quorum.

01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:03.360
Welcome back.

01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:05.360
Member Escobedo.

01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:07.360
Yes.

01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:09.360
Vice President Glover-Woods.

01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:13.360
I see Vice President Glover-Woods.

01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:15.360
So.

01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:17.360
Member Lewis.

01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:19.360
Yes.

01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:21.360
Member McQuillan.

01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:23.360
Yes.

01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:25.360
Member Olken.

01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:27.360
Yes.

01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:29.360
Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:31.360
Yes.

01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:33.360
Vice President Glover.

01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:35.360
Yes.

01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:37.360
Member Rodriguez.

01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:39.360
Yes.

01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:41.360
Member Yoshimoto-Towry.

01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:43.360
Yes.

01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:45.360
Everyone is present.

01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:47.360
All right.

01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:49.360
The next exciting item

01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:51.360
is item 13.

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:53.360
The update on the implementation of the

01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:55.360
integrated local state and federal

01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:57.360
accountability and continuous improvement

01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:59.360
system. Approval of the California

01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:01.360
school dashboard principles.

01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:03.360
Review of the local control and

01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:05.360
accountability plan requirements for

01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:07.360
the English learner student group.

01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:09.360
And dashboard outreach activities.

01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:11.360
And the item for action

01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:13.360
is the CDE recommends the approval

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:15.360
of the California school dashboard

01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:17.360
principles.

01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:19.360
This item will be presented by Cindy

01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:21.360
Kazanis and Josh Strong of the CDE.

01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:23.360
As well as Eric Crane

01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:25.360
from West Ed and representatives of

01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:27.360
the Sacramento County Office of

01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:29.360
Education.

01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:31.360
I saw Shanna Cook Harvey over there.

01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:33.360
So hello, Shanna.

01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:35.360
And others from the Sacramento County.

01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:37.360
Cindy, please begin.

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:39.360
Thank you, President

01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:41.360
Darling-Hammond. I'm Cindy Kazanis.

01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:43.360
I'm the director of the analysis

01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:45.360
measurement and accountability reporting

01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:47.360
division. It's great to be with you this

01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:49.360
morning on a Thursday.

01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:51.360
We have been extremely

01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:53.360
busy these last couple of weeks,

01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:55.360
if not this whole year.

01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:57.360
We're going to hear some of the culmination

01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:59.360
of the work for

01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:01.360
accountability today

01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:03.360
for the year.

01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:05.360
And we'll give you a little bit of a

01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:07.360
glimpse into the public

01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:09.360
release that we're planning for in December.

01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:11.360
Before I get started, I just want

01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:13.360
to acknowledge yesterday you had a celebration

01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:15.360
for two of my favorite attorneys

01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:17.360
in the entire state. Amy Holloway

01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:19.360
and Judy Sias.

01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:21.360
And I, just from a personal

01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:23.360
perspective, what great examples

01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:25.360
of career public servants

01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:27.360
they are and have learned

01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:29.360
so much from them. And their leadership

01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:31.360
has been invaluable to our work,

01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:33.360
not only in accountability, but

01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:35.360
in compliance and other

01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:37.360
things that are maybe not so exciting

01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:39.360
to the public, but are necessary

01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:41.360
pieces of our democracy.

01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:43.360
And so I just wanted to acknowledge

01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:45.360
you have two amazing

01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:47.360
individuals

01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:49.360
who have been supporting your work for a

01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:51.360
number of years. And it's

01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:53.360
going to be a lot of big shoes to fill.

01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:57.360
So shifting over to today's topics,

01:43:57.360 --> 01:43:59.360
we're going to talk about our dashboard principles,

01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:01.360
the California School Dashboard Principles

01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:03.360
through Attachment 1.

01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:05.360
You're going to learn a little bit more

01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:07.360
with my colleague Josh Strong

01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:09.360
about our English Learner Student Group and

01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:11.360
their role in the local control and accountability

01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:13.360
plan process. And then

01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:15.360
we'll close it out with our dashboard

01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:17.360
outreach activities.

01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:19.360
We are all over the state. I just

01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:21.360
came back from Anaheim and going to San

01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:23.360
Diego tonight, and I'm really excited to share

01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:25.360
with you how these activities

01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:27.360
are really, I think, impacting

01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:29.360
the field in a positive manner.

01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:33.360
As already stated by President Darlene Hammond,

01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:35.360
the item recommendation is

01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:37.360
the California Department of Education,

01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:39.360
CDE, recommends approval

01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:41.360
of the California School Dashboard Principles.

01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:45.360
So shifting over to

01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:47.360
Attachment 1,

01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:49.360
one thing I've been reflecting on, because

01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:51.360
we keep getting a lot of correspondence, I think,

01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:53.360
that is confused about the

01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:55.360
purpose of these principles. So I

01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:57.360
looked back at one of the organizations

01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:59.360
that are, that we follow as a

01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:01.360
state agency, which is the Council of

01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:03.360
Chief State School Officers.

01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:05.360
And back in 2019, they put out

01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:09.360
a really good handbook for state

01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:11.360
agencies to look at in thinking about

01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:13.360
managing changes that affect

01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:15.360
accountability outcomes.

01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:17.360
And one of the statements in that

01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:19.360
document really, I think,

01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:21.360
really summarizes today's work

01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:23.360
around the principles. And I'm going to just

01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:25.360
quote it verbatim so I don't

01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:27.360
mess this up, but it talks about

01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:29.360
many of the changes to the accountability

01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:31.360
and assessment systems are necessary.

01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:33.360
And, if implemented with fidelity,

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:35.360
can effectively support

01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:37.360
the ultimate goal of any

01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:39.360
educational system, improving

01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:41.360
learning for all students.

01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:43.360
However, implementing these changes

01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:45.360
can be complicated, multi-layered,

01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:47.360
and multi-faceted endeavor involving

01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:49.360
many actors and stakeholders.

01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:51.360
A change to one component or aspect of

01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:53.360
either accountability or assessment systems

01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:55.360
can lead to a chain reaction

01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:57.360
that affects other components or other

01:45:57.360 --> 01:45:59.360
aspects in both systems.

01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:01.360
Changes generally have implications

01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:03.360
and consequences, intended

01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:05.360
or unintended, on the interpretation

01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:07.360
and use of accountability outcomes.

01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:09.360
States, therefore, need to

01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:11.360
thoughtfully plan

01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:13.360
and carefully manage the changes

01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:15.360
with respect to implementation,

01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:17.360
reporting, and communication.

01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:19.360
So before you today is

01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:21.360
the start of that process.

01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:23.360
We know there are changes coming to this dashboard.

01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:25.360
You've heard it in the last item

01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:27.360
around science. You've heard it

01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:29.360
in prior board meetings around English

01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:31.360
learners and

01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:33.360
the use of the English learner progress indicator

01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:35.360
and the academic

01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:37.360
indicator. And so the principles

01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:39.360
are intended to have

01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:41.360
the board really

01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:43.360
document the work that has been done to

01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:45.360
date, but also to look forward

01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:47.360
to using these as a

01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:49.360
basis to support decisions.

01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:51.360
It doesn't mean that these principles can't

01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:53.360
change, but in fact this allows

01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:55.360
us to at least have a framework

01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:57.360
and some guardrails for moving forward.

01:46:57.360 --> 01:46:59.360
We are committed as a department to

01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:01.360
bringing these principles back to you

01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:03.360
annually. If there are adjustments that need to be

01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:05.360
made to allow

01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:07.360
for additional indicators to come in

01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:09.360
in a different fashion than what was first

01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:11.360
envisioned, I absolutely

01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:13.360
will bring that to you. So I just want to make

01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:15.360
sure that I put that lens forward

01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:17.360
as this is simply the beginning of

01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:19.360
a conversation we know is going to be a long

01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:21.360
one over the next couple of years.

01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:23.360
So when

01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:25.360
we looked and we heard from you

01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:27.360
and from others in

01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:29.360
anticipation of the adoption

01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:31.360
of these principles at

01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:33.360
this meeting, we incorporated

01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:35.360
changes that we

01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:37.360
again heard at the State Board of Education meeting,

01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:39.360
the CPAC meeting, and members of the public.

01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:41.360
And so in table one

01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:43.360
I want to make sure that you have that in front of you

01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:45.360
because we're not going to show you that table. We're going to show you

01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:47.360
the clean version of the principles.

01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:49.360
That

01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:51.360
table one shows you

01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:53.360
the September version, it shows you

01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:55.360
the November version, and then we were able to

01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:57.360
use track changes

01:47:57.360 --> 01:47:59.360
to show you what had been changed in

01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:01.360
response to your feedback.

01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:03.360
We heard that there's some grammatical

01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:05.360
pieces that may need to be changed

01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:07.360
and so we look forward to your feedback

01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:09.360
around

01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:11.360
consistent use of the word dashboard

01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:13.360
principles as opposed to accountability

01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:15.360
system.

01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:17.360
And so to get us started,

01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:19.360
let me just reiterate the purpose of the dashboard.

01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:21.360
The California School

01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:23.360
Dashboard provides parents and educators

01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:25.360
with meaningful information

01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:27.360
on school and district progress

01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:29.360
so they can participate in decisions to improve

01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:31.360
student learning. And with that,

01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:33.360
I am pleased to turn this over

01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:35.360
to my colleague from West

01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:37.360
Ed, or rather the R15

01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:39.360
Comprehensive Center, Eric Crane.

01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:47.360
Thank you, Director Kazanis.

01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:51.360
President Darling-Hammond, Vice President

01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:53.360
Glover-Woods, Chief Deputy

01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:55.360
Superintendent Nicely,

01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:57.360
and distinguished board members, good morning.

01:48:57.360 --> 01:48:59.360
I'm Eric Crane

01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:01.360
and I'm a senior researcher and technical

01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:03.360
assistance provider with the Region 15

01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:05.360
Comprehensive Center at West Ed.

01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:07.360
I want to start with a little bit of background

01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:09.360
about the comp centers.

01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:11.360
We provide high quality, intensive

01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:13.360
capacity building services

01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:15.360
to states in the western region that includes

01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:17.360
California as well as Nevada,

01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:19.360
Utah, and Arizona.

01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:21.360
Our focus is in helping

01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:23.360
state agencies

01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:25.360
implement evidence-based

01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:27.360
programs and practices and interventions

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:29.360
that support improved outcomes for

01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:31.360
students and educators.

01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:35.360
The context for the principles

01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:37.360
was that there

01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:39.360
includes that there were some changes

01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:41.360
at the CDE, at the leadership level,

01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:43.360
new board members,

01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:45.360
and the importance

01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:47.360
of identifying,

01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:49.360
documenting, enshrining,

01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:51.360
and memorializing formally

01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:53.360
some of the discussions of

01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:55.360
past boards as relates to the accountability

01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:57.360
system, specifically

01:49:57.360 --> 01:49:59.360
focusing on the dashboard.

01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:01.360
So the department reached out to Region

01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:03.360
15 to facilitate

01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:05.360
the discussion and to document

01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:07.360
these principles.

01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:11.360
The request stems

01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:13.360
in some measure from

01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:15.360
a successful

01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:17.360
work that was done in a different

01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:19.360
context where when CDE

01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:21.360
with the SBE was looking

01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:23.360
at the development of a growth model,

01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:25.360
the establishment documentation

01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:27.360
of principles around the

01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:29.360
growth model was helpful to that

01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:31.360
process. So the request was that

01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:33.360
the comp center provide

01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:35.360
content expertise, facilitate

01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:37.360
conversation about the principles among CDE

01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:39.360
leadership, and present to groups

01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:41.360
such as the TDG and

01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:43.360
CPAG, take the lead

01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:45.360
in documenting the discussion, and

01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:47.360
then present to the board.

01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:51.360
So I want

01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:53.360
to start, and let me acknowledge the

01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:55.360
rich robust discussion back at the

01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:57.360
September meeting. You'll find

01:50:57.360 --> 01:50:59.360
that while there are not

01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:01.360
many changes from September,

01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:03.360
those that have been made in the interim

01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:05.360
do reflect that discussion

01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:07.360
and they're pretty

01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:09.360
significant in their scope

01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:11.360
and framing about some of the issues

01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:13.360
here. So Dashboard Principle 1

01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:15.360
is that the dashboard focuses on

01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:17.360
elements that express the commitment

01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:19.360
to a well-rounded, well-supported

01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:21.360
education and makes space for what is

01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:23.360
valued locally. The change

01:51:23.360 --> 01:51:25.360
here was just really one of clarification.

01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:27.360
The past version had the word

01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:29.360
priorities in there and

01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:31.360
there was consensus that for clarity

01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:33.360
and to minimize any chance of

01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:35.360
confusion with

01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:37.360
LCFF priorities that

01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:39.360
the word commitment gets

01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:41.360
substituted in for

01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:43.360
priorities.

01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:45.360
Dashboard Principle

01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:47.360
2, that the dashboard reports opportunity

01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:49.360
and performance gaps among student

01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:51.360
groups through the equity report that

01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:53.360
is available for each state indicator.

01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:55.360
So this principle

01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:57.360
received the most robust discussion

01:51:57.360 --> 01:51:59.360
at the September meeting

01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:01.360
and has the most significant

01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:03.360
changes, both in the

01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:05.360
main text and in the supporting

01:52:05.360 --> 01:52:07.360
paragraph.

01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:09.360
The changes here

01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:11.360
elevate

01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:13.360
the

01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:15.360
idea of

01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:17.360
and the importance of highlighting

01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:19.360
opportunity and performance gaps.

01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:21.360
That was something that we heard loud and

01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:23.360
clear from the board back in September

01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:25.360
and so that language of

01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:27.360
opportunity and performance gaps

01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:29.360
is in the statement proper

01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:31.360
as well as the

01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:33.360
elaboration within the supporting

01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:35.360
paragraph. So

01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:37.360
it's Principle 2 that saw the biggest

01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:39.360
changes since September.

01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:43.360
Principle 3

01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:45.360
that the dashboard reports each

01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:47.360
indicator separately. Now the thing to

01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:49.360
be said about Principle 3

01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:51.360
is that this one

01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:53.360
also saw pretty significant

01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:55.360
edits since September.

01:52:55.360 --> 01:52:57.360
The framing

01:52:57.360 --> 01:52:59.360
back in September was

01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:01.360
gives equal

01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:03.360
weight to each indicator and

01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:05.360
those six words

01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:07.360
contain a

01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:09.360
lot and really upon

01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:11.360
reflection really needed to be

01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:13.360
expanded into two.

01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:15.360
So the old

01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:17.360
dashboard Principle 3

01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:19.360
from the September meeting has now become

01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:21.360
Principles 3 and 4.

01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:23.360
And in this

01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:25.360
treatment with Principle 3

01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:27.360
we're highlighting that the

01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:29.360
different indicators are reported

01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:31.360
separately.

01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:33.360
The big idea here in

01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:35.360
the revised Principle 3

01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:37.360
is that California

01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:39.360
in significant

01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:41.360
contrast to

01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:43.360
most of the states

01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:45.360
does not apply X percent

01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:47.360
to this indicator and Y percent to this

01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:49.360
other indicator to boil it down

01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:51.360
to a single index.

01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:53.360
By highlighting each

01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:55.360
indicator separately

01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:57.360
California's made a thoughtful

01:53:57.360 --> 01:53:59.360
decision that

01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:01.360
discussions about each

01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:03.360
indicator are important

01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:05.360
on their own and that the color

01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:07.360
based system that California uses

01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:09.360
facilitates those kinds of conversations

01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:11.360
about how a school or

01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:13.360
LEA is doing on

01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:15.360
say graduation rate or

01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:17.360
say mathematics performance.

01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:19.360
So Principle 3 is about

01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:21.360
keeping the reporting separate

01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:23.360
for each indicator.

01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:25.360
The new Principle 4

01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:27.360
is the other part that was

01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:29.360
in the former Principle 3

01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:31.360
and that's that the dashboard values each indicator

01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:33.360
equally. By not

01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:35.360
putting a percentage weight

01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:37.360
on each indicator and by showing

01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:39.360
each indicator standing on

01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:41.360
its own the dashboard

01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:43.360
draws just as much attention

01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:45.360
to each and every indicator

01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:47.360
and in fact

01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:49.360
in the early versions of many

01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:51.360
state systems

01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:53.360
test scores predominated in

01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:55.360
their importance in the system

01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:57.360
not so with California's system.

01:54:57.360 --> 01:54:59.360
Yes the number of indicators

01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:03.360
do

01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:05.360
lean toward academic

01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:09.360
performance and academic indicators and that's

01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:11.360
in keeping with the

01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:13.360
requirements of ESSA and

01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:15.360
with California's priorities.

01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:19.360
But again there's no

01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:21.360
naming or over weighting

01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:23.360
of one indicator over another.

01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:25.360
Taken in the aggregate there

01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:27.360
is a substantial focus

01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:29.360
on academic indicators.

01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:35.360
Principle 5 the dashboard

01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:37.360
values high performance and growth

01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:39.360
equally. No changes

01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:41.360
here.

01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:43.360
Principle 6

01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:45.360
the dashboard

01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:47.360
reports transparently and

01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:49.360
comprehensively at the state district school

01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:51.360
and student group levels.

01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:53.360
Again from September no

01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:55.360
changes here.

01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:57.360
Principle 7

01:55:57.360 --> 01:55:59.360
the dashboard promotes

01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:01.360
effective visualization, clear communication

01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:03.360
and thorough documentation.

01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:05.360
For here just the supporting

01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:07.360
paragraph had just a small technical

01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:09.360
cleanup.

01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:11.360
Dashboard

01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:13.360
principle 8 that the dashboard

01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:15.360
reflects technical quality through

01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:17.360
measures that are valid and reliable.

01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:21.360
Principle 9

01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:23.360
that the dashboard leverages

01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:25.360
the expertise and the perspectives

01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:27.360
of a broad set of educational

01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:29.360
partners and community members.

01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:31.360
Again no changes

01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:33.360
since September.

01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:39.360
Principle 10

01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:41.360
the dashboard promotes coherence between

01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:43.360
data reporting and support

01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:45.360
improvement programs.

01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:47.360
Again no changes. And finally

01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:49.360
dashboard

01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:51.360
principle 11 the dashboard is

01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:53.360
subject to continuous revision and

01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:55.360
improvement. And I'll just say something

01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:57.360
about again this was no changes since

01:56:57.360 --> 01:56:59.360
September but I'll say something about this and I think

01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:01.360
Director Kazan has framed it really nicely

01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:03.360
in the opening that

01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:05.360
the process of

01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:07.360
looking at the dashboards

01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:09.360
it's the department's intent to bring

01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:11.360
these annually before the board and

01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:13.360
that would be my recommendation as well

01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:15.360
is that in pulling together

01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:17.360
principles

01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:19.360
things do change

01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:21.360
and the idea of

01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:23.360
looking at the principles

01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:25.360
annually makes a lot of

01:57:25.360 --> 01:57:27.360
good sense and so it was

01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:29.360
really helpful to hear that framing and

01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:31.360
I think that's something to be supported.

01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:33.360
Really with

01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:35.360
that that's the gist

01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:37.360
of the changes in terms of the dashboard

01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:39.360
principles and I'll pass it back

01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:41.360
over to Director Kazanis.

01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:45.360
Thank you Eric. President Darling-Hammond

01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:47.360
did you want to pause for

01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:49.360
clarifying questions or how would you like to proceed?

01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:53.360
I was just thinking that

01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:55.360
same thing I think we should

01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:57.360
this is a as everyone knows the

01:57:57.360 --> 01:57:59.360
mega accountability item and so

01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:01.360
we will try to pause

01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:03.360
by topic area. Are there

01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:05.360
any clarifying questions at this moment?

01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:11.360
That was perfectly clear.

01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:13.360
Continue on.

01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:15.360
Thank you.

01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:19.360
Okay we're going to shift

01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:21.360
over to attachment two and as

01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:23.360
I mentioned we have a whole team

01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:25.360
supporting this attachment.

01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:27.360
I'm going to provide you a bit of a

01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:29.360
brief background as to

01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:31.360
how we came to this topic

01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:33.360
and then I will turn it over to my colleague

01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:35.360
Josh Strong from

01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:37.360
the local

01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:39.360
agency

01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:41.360
system of support

01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:43.360
office. Lasso. I know the

01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:45.360
acronym well. The words

01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:47.360
in between I've forgotten

01:58:47.360 --> 01:58:49.360
this morning. Thank you for

01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:51.360
the assist.

01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:53.360
Alright so just briefly

01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:55.360
to review your discussion

01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:57.360
from September from just

01:58:57.360 --> 01:58:59.360
a little over

01:58:59.360 --> 01:59:01.360
six seven weeks ago.

01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:03.360
The department in response

01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:05.360
to inquiries

01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:07.360
from the state board of education we provided

01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:09.360
a comprehensive review

01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:11.360
of first state board of education

01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:13.360
prior action on

01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:15.360
defining the English owner student

01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:17.360
group for the dashboard academic

01:59:17.360 --> 01:59:19.360
indicators as allowed

01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:21.360
under the Every Student Succeeds Act.

01:59:21.360 --> 01:59:23.360
We also provided

01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:25.360
historical information on

01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:27.360
SBE prior action on the development

01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:29.360
of the English learner progress indicator.

01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:31.360
You heard a presentation

01:59:31.360 --> 01:59:33.360
from Kenji Hakuta

01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:35.360
who's a national expert on

01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:37.360
English learner students. I heard his name this

01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:39.360
morning in Mal's presentation

01:59:39.360 --> 01:59:41.360
on assessment so Kenji

01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:43.360
still seems to be working even though he's

01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:45.360
retired and

01:59:45.360 --> 01:59:47.360
specifically Dr.

01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:49.360
Hakuta's work on the structure of the English

01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:51.360
learner student group as it was

01:59:51.360 --> 01:59:53.360
intended under the Every Student Succeeds

01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:55.360
Act back from

01:59:55.360 --> 01:59:57.360
2014 and

01:59:57.360 --> 01:59:59.360
2015.

01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:01.360
So just as a

02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:03.360
reminder the definition for California

02:00:03.360 --> 02:00:05.360
of English learners in the

02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:07.360
academic indicators are

02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:09.360
students who are reported as an English

02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:11.360
learner student any time during

02:00:11.360 --> 02:00:13.360
the academic year including

02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:15.360
in September the purpose

02:00:15.360 --> 02:00:17.360
for including RFIPs

02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:19.360
in the academic indicator

02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:21.360
for our English learner student

02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:23.360
group is first that it removes

02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:25.360
disincentives for

02:00:25.360 --> 02:00:27.360
reclassifying

02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:29.360
students.

02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:31.360
The purpose for including

02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:33.360
RFIPs in the

02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:35.360
academic indicator

02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:37.360
for our English learner student

02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:39.360
group is first that it

02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:41.360
removes disincentives

02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:43.360
for reclassification the districts

02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:45.360
once experienced under that old

02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:47.360
accountability model.

02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:49.360
It allows us to see actual

02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:51.360
and ongoing progress of English

02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:53.360
learners that the English learners

02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:55.360
are making within an LEA

02:00:55.360 --> 02:00:57.360
and without them the category

02:00:57.360 --> 02:00:59.360
of English learners would likely always show

02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:01.360
low performance. We also

02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:03.360
cannot know whether recent RFIPs

02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:05.360
are continuing to progress if

02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:07.360
we don't show them for

02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:09.360
years out.

02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:11.360
It also allows us to understand

02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:13.360
English learner development program

02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:15.360
the success of that program from

02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:17.360
initial identification through initial

02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:19.360
years of reclassification.

02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:21.360
Two other points that we made back in

02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:23.360
September is number four

02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:25.360
that including RFIPs

02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:27.360
assist with the stability of the student

02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:29.360
group and I just wanted to make

02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:31.360
a note that since reclassification

02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:33.360
is locally determined

02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:35.360
by local educational agencies

02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:37.360
English learner and RFIP student populations

02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:39.360
may have different characteristics

02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:41.360
because we don't have this unified

02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:43.360
standard and they have

02:01:43.360 --> 02:01:45.360
a variety of criteria they can use

02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:47.360
to determine reclassified students.

02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:49.360
Finally

02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:51.360
the

02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:53.360
including RFIPs significantly

02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:55.360
increases number of schools

02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:57.360
and LEAs with a valid end size

02:01:57.360 --> 02:01:59.360
to receive a color. So we actually

02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:01.360
see a presence of English learner

02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:03.360
student groups for

02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:05.360
increased number of schools. I think you

02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:07.360
may remember from

02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:09.360
September it is

02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:11.360
over a thousand if not

02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:13.360
more than

02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:15.360
that that would drop out if

02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:17.360
we didn't include the RFIP

02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:19.360
student group in the academic indicator.

02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:21.360
So we

02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:23.360
spent the last couple of weeks

02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:25.360
also thinking it would be helpful

02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:27.360
to provide an actual example

02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:29.360
and so the example I'm going to

02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:31.360
show you is

02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:33.360
also in the context of when

02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:35.360
the Ever Student Succeeds Act first

02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:37.360
rolled out and states were considering

02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:39.360
their definitions for their

02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:41.360
SSA plans. The source

02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:43.360
of this example

02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:45.360
is from

02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:47.360
a blog or a post called

02:02:47.360 --> 02:02:49.360
Ending the No Child Left Behind

02:02:49.360 --> 02:02:51.360
Catch 22 on

02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:53.360
English Learner Progress and we do have

02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:55.360
the link to that

02:02:55.360 --> 02:02:57.360
report here on this slide.

02:02:57.360 --> 02:02:59.360
So I'm going to

02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:01.360
actually not spend

02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:03.360
time on this. I'm going to show you a graphic

02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:05.360
and I'm going to verbally walk through

02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:07.360
the points that I have on this slide.

02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:09.360
So just to appoint you

02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:11.360
to this example

02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:13.360
this is a list of 11

02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:15.360
students. You can see their names

02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:17.360
on the left hand side under the column

02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:19.360
student name. We have

02:03:19.360 --> 02:03:21.360
two

02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:23.360
years of data. I have data

02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:25.360
from 2015 for students

02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:27.360
and 2016. But I've

02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:29.360
actually disaggregated or this

02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:31.360
example disaggregates this

02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:33.360
by three

02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:35.360
columns for the second year of data.

02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:37.360
Specifically

02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:39.360
this school, this hypothetical

02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:41.360
school is known as Middleville.

02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:43.360
It was a school

02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:45.360
that the instructional program for

02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:47.360
English Learners was strong for all

02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:49.360
students. As you

02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:51.360
can see from column

02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:53.360
the column labeled

02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:55.360
2015 to the column next to it

02:03:55.360 --> 02:03:57.360
which is 2016 with all

02:03:57.360 --> 02:03:59.360
scores all students

02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:01.360
made gains on their English Language

02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:03.360
Arts assessment with an average

02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:05.360
score increase of 18 points

02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:07.360
from 2015 to 2016.

02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:09.360
You can see that in the average

02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:11.360
change which is the last

02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:13.360
row of

02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:15.360
that column three, the column labeled

02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:17.360
as 2016

02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:19.360
with all scores.

02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:21.360
In 2016

02:04:21.360 --> 02:04:23.360
two students met the reclassification criteria

02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:25.360
Rafael and Irina

02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:27.360
the first two students listed.

02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:29.360
You see that in

02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:31.360
column which is

02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:33.360
labeled with numbers.

02:04:33.360 --> 02:04:35.360
The third column over

02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:37.360
with data which is called 2016

02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:39.360
without reclassified students

02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:41.360
you can see that they are no longer

02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:43.360
applicable to be a part of the

02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:45.360
group.

02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:47.360
The students were reclassified

02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:49.360
because they reached the targeted score

02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:51.360
of 350. They were

02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:53.360
subsequently removed from the calculations

02:04:53.360 --> 02:04:55.360
of the English learner student group.

02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:57.360
You see if you scroll down to the

02:04:57.360 --> 02:04:59.360
bottom of that column

02:04:59.360 --> 02:05:01.360
the average change has now dropped from 18

02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:03.360
to negative 5.

02:05:03.360 --> 02:05:05.360
Again keeping in mind

02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:07.360
that every student

02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:09.360
in this school that is an English

02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:11.360
learner had actually increased their scores.

02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:15.360
Moving over to the final column

02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:17.360
there was in

02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:19.360
late 2015 after

02:05:19.360 --> 02:05:21.360
the assessment was

02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:23.360
completed a new student arrived

02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:25.360
an immigrant newcomer student

02:05:25.360 --> 02:05:27.360
which is Jesse.

02:05:27.360 --> 02:05:29.360
Jesse did not have a score in 2015

02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:31.360
and we skip over

02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:33.360
to that final column

02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:35.360
and he received a low score of 90.

02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:37.360
The inclusion of the students

02:05:37.360 --> 02:05:39.360
score impacted the total

02:05:39.360 --> 02:05:41.360
average score of the ELs

02:05:41.360 --> 02:05:43.360
to the extent that

02:05:43.360 --> 02:05:45.360
it dropped from again starting at

02:05:45.360 --> 02:05:47.360
positive 18 to negative

02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:49.360
23.

02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:51.360
Overall we can see

02:05:51.360 --> 02:05:53.360
again this Catch-22 impact

02:05:53.360 --> 02:05:55.360
of removing our reclassified

02:05:55.360 --> 02:05:57.360
students and only keeping

02:05:57.360 --> 02:05:59.360
current ELs in the definition.

02:05:59.360 --> 02:06:01.360
Another way of looking at this

02:06:01.360 --> 02:06:03.360
is from the overall

02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:05.360
scores from year to year

02:06:05.360 --> 02:06:07.360
in which we see this same

02:06:07.360 --> 02:06:09.360
situation, this same school

02:06:11.360 --> 02:06:13.360
just in a graphic form.

02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:15.360
So the first two columns here

02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:17.360
it says same students, the blue

02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:19.360
which is the first column, excuse me

02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:21.360
their scores were

02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:23.360
257 overall

02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:25.360
or rather on average

02:06:25.360 --> 02:06:27.360
the second column which is 2016

02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:29.360
overall they had

02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:31.360
275 average scores.

02:06:31.360 --> 02:06:33.360
We shift over to the

02:06:33.360 --> 02:06:35.360
second set of data

02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:37.360
which is our reclassified students from

02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:39.360
removed from the EL group and you see

02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:41.360
that shift. You see a shift

02:06:41.360 --> 02:06:43.360
from the overall scores for 2015

02:06:43.360 --> 02:06:45.360
being higher than the

02:06:45.360 --> 02:06:47.360
2016 scores.

02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:49.360
So that drop of the five points that

02:06:49.360 --> 02:06:51.360
we talked about. The final column

02:06:51.360 --> 02:06:53.360
again showing this graphically the impact

02:06:53.360 --> 02:06:55.360
of the one newcomer student

02:06:55.360 --> 02:06:57.360
and only allowing current ELs in the

02:06:57.360 --> 02:06:59.360
definition. So again this is

02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:01.360
just a hypothetical example

02:07:01.360 --> 02:07:03.360
that was done in preparation

02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:05.360
for states considering

02:07:05.360 --> 02:07:07.360
English learners and whether or not to

02:07:07.360 --> 02:07:09.360
keep our FEPs as part of the definition

02:07:09.360 --> 02:07:11.360
for the academic indicator

02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:13.360
based on previous experience

02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:15.360
from the No Child Left Behind days. So just

02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:17.360
wanted to make sure that we provided you

02:07:17.360 --> 02:07:19.360
yet another example of

02:07:19.360 --> 02:07:21.360
I think why the decision

02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:23.360
that the board made back in

02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:25.360
the beginning of

02:07:25.360 --> 02:07:27.360
the development of the S.S. state plan

02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:29.360
is something that still resonates.

02:07:29.360 --> 02:07:31.360
So I know this is a little bit of a

02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:33.360
complicated conversation. I just

02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:35.360
before we shift over to

02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:37.360
Josh and a couple of resources I wanted

02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:39.360
to make sure President Darling-Hammond

02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:41.360
paused in case there were any clarifying questions here.

02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:51.360
I am on mute.

02:07:51.360 --> 02:07:53.360
Are there any clarifying questions?

02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:57.360
Thanks for the

02:07:57.360 --> 02:07:59.360
example Cindy.

02:07:59.360 --> 02:08:01.360
It shows what different

02:08:01.360 --> 02:08:03.360
inferences we would draw

02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:05.360
about a school based on this.

02:08:05.360 --> 02:08:07.360
Member Escobedo?

02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:09.360
I want to share that

02:08:09.360 --> 02:08:11.360
I saw this when I

02:08:11.360 --> 02:08:13.360
first became superintendent and saw the

02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:15.360
transition

02:08:15.360 --> 02:08:17.360
that I had

02:08:17.360 --> 02:08:19.360
schools that

02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:21.360
on purpose

02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:24.360
halted reclassification

02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:26.360
because of this dip

02:08:26.360 --> 02:08:28.360
which could be

02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:30.360
very detrimental for students

02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:33.360
especially if you're going into middle school

02:08:33.360 --> 02:08:35.360
and you're tracked

02:08:35.360 --> 02:08:37.360
and you should have been reclassified several

02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:39.360
years ago. So

02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:41.360
the repercussions of

02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:43.360
No Child Left Behind

02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:45.360
or the consequences of this

02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:47.360
artificial

02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:49.360
dip was real

02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:51.360
and the effects it had

02:08:51.360 --> 02:08:53.360
on student learning

02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:55.360
was devastating.

02:08:55.360 --> 02:08:57.360
So I just want to share that

02:08:57.360 --> 02:08:59.360
yes there's a dip of scores

02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:01.360
but how some

02:09:01.360 --> 02:09:03.360
schools delayed

02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:05.360
reclassification

02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:07.360
had a devastating effect on

02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:09.360
many of our English learners.

02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:11.360
And of course in that accountability

02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:13.360
system

02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:15.360
this is supposed to let us know

02:09:15.360 --> 02:09:17.360
whether a school is doing a good job with

02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:19.360
its English learners. You have school

02:09:19.360 --> 02:09:21.360
that's doing a really good job with its English learners

02:09:21.360 --> 02:09:23.360
looking as though it's

02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:25.360
declining

02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:27.360
because it is doing

02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:29.360
such a good job of reclassifying.

02:09:29.360 --> 02:09:31.360
So

02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:33.360
that was the catch 22.

02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:35.360
Any other

02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:37.360
clarifying questions or comments before

02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:39.360
Cindy proceeds?

02:09:39.360 --> 02:09:41.360
Take it away.

02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:43.360
The other

02:09:43.360 --> 02:09:45.360
piece that we

02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:47.360
did as a takeaway from the September

02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:49.360
meeting was that there was a need for

02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:51.360
additional resources to support

02:09:51.360 --> 02:09:53.360
English learners

02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:55.360
for the rollout of the dashboard

02:09:55.360 --> 02:09:57.360
in 2022. And so

02:09:57.360 --> 02:09:59.360
since your

02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:01.360
I feel like I have a little bit of a feedback

02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:03.360
here. So since your

02:10:03.360 --> 02:10:05.360
agenda was published

02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:07.360
those resources have become live

02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:09.360
on our website. And so the first

02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:11.360
being

02:10:11.360 --> 02:10:13.360
how English learners are defined for

02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:15.360
each indicator. So you see

02:10:15.360 --> 02:10:17.360
on

02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:19.360
this screen there's a flyer

02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:21.360
that's in purple. Purple is

02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:23.360
deliberate because that is the color we're using on

02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:25.360
the dashboard this year for status only.

02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:27.360
And then each

02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:29.360
of the indicators at the state level

02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:31.360
are listed that will be used

02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:33.360
that are used

02:10:33.360 --> 02:10:35.360
on the dashboard. And so you see

02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:37.360
a definition for academic

02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:39.360
performance, college career readiness,

02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:41.360
English learners progress,

02:10:41.360 --> 02:10:43.360
chronic absenteeism, graduation

02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:45.360
rate and suspension rate.

02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:47.360
This is one of the

02:10:47.360 --> 02:10:49.360
student groups that has I think one of the more

02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:51.360
complex definitions because

02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:53.360
of the allowances under again the

02:10:53.360 --> 02:10:55.360
Every Student Succeeds Act for

02:10:55.360 --> 02:10:57.360
this student group. You can find

02:10:57.360 --> 02:10:59.360
this resource on our dashboard toolkit.

02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:01.360
You can Google us at CDE

02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:03.360
Dashboard Toolkit

02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:05.360
and we will be, we're going to be your

02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:07.360
top choice. The other

02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:09.360
resource that we added was

02:11:09.360 --> 02:11:11.360
how to look at English

02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:13.360
learners and disaggregate

02:11:13.360 --> 02:11:15.360
it for the academic indicator.

02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:17.360
And so this is a new resource that

02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:19.360
we again developed in direct

02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:21.360
response to your discussion

02:11:21.360 --> 02:11:23.360
in September. And so you can see

02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:25.360
on this graphic that

02:11:25.360 --> 02:11:27.360
there is

02:11:27.360 --> 02:11:29.360
first there's a card that talks about

02:11:29.360 --> 02:11:31.360
English learners and I'm actually showing

02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:33.360
off for the first time to you what

02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:35.360
our cards are going to look like

02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:37.360
for 2022. We are using

02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:39.360
a cell phone look.

02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:41.360
You can see the low, it has two bars.

02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:43.360
Of course if you're at five

02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:45.360
bars fully charged

02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:47.360
you are

02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:49.360
doing great and you're serving your

02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:51.360
English learner students well

02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:53.360
on the academic indicator. So for this one

02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:55.360
it gives you not only

02:11:55.360 --> 02:11:57.360
the overall perspective for that

02:11:57.360 --> 02:11:59.360
student group for the academic indicator

02:11:59.360 --> 02:12:01.360
but then again when we

02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:03.360
do view more information we see

02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:05.360
that bottom graphic

02:12:05.360 --> 02:12:07.360
of the disaggregated data

02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:09.360
for current English learners,

02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:11.360
reclassified English learners, and

02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:13.360
English only. And so

02:12:13.360 --> 02:12:15.360
this is one that I

02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:17.360
appreciate quite a bit

02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:19.360
because often times

02:12:19.360 --> 02:12:21.360
while the data on this particular graphic shows

02:12:21.360 --> 02:12:23.360
that reclassified English learners

02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:25.360
and English only scored exactly the same

02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:27.360
amount which is probably impossible

02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:29.360
you would usually see our RFEPs

02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:31.360
doing actually much better than

02:12:31.360 --> 02:12:33.360
any of those student groups. So

02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:35.360
again this is another way

02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:37.360
of slicing the information

02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:39.360
which is something that you specifically asked for.

02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:41.360
So both of those flyers are available

02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:43.360
again at CDE

02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:45.360
Dashboard Toolkit if you're Googling

02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:47.360
or on our website under

02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:49.360
our toolkit. And with that I would like

02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:51.360
to turn it over to Josh Strong to

02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:53.360
walk through the remainder of this attachment.

02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:05.360
Thank you Cindy.

02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:07.360
Good morning

02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:09.360
President Erling Hammond,

02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:11.360
Vice President Glover Woods,

02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:13.360
Chief Deputy Nicely, and

02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:15.360
members of the board. I bring you greetings

02:13:15.360 --> 02:13:17.360
on behalf of the Director of the

02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:19.360
Student Achievement and Support Division

02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:21.360
John McGee. He and a number of colleagues

02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:23.360
from the division are

02:13:23.360 --> 02:13:25.360
down at a conference in San Diego

02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:27.360
and Cindy

02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:29.360
will catch up with him tomorrow.

02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:31.360
So my name is Joshua Strong

02:13:31.360 --> 02:13:33.360
I'm the Administrator in the Local

02:13:33.360 --> 02:13:35.360
Agency System Support Office here

02:13:35.360 --> 02:13:37.360
at the California Department of Education

02:13:37.360 --> 02:13:39.360
and I'm bringing you

02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:41.360
an update today on the specific

02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:43.360
requirements related to English

02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:45.360
learners that exist within

02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:47.360
the Local Control and Accountability

02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:49.360
Plan Template and Instructions.

02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:51.360
As all of you

02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:53.360
are no doubt aware

02:13:53.360 --> 02:13:55.360
in 2013

02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:57.360
with the implementation

02:13:57.360 --> 02:13:59.360
of LCFF there's

02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:01.360
been a requirement for all

02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:03.360
LEAs to develop

02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:05.360
and annually update the

02:14:05.360 --> 02:14:07.360
Local Control and Accountability Plan

02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:09.360
or LCAP.

02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:11.360
This is something that's done

02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:13.360
in

02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:15.360
cooperation and

02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:17.360
in collaboration with

02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:19.360
local educational partners.

02:14:19.360 --> 02:14:21.360
Within this annual process

02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:23.360
they're evaluating progress

02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:25.360
within the

02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:27.360
LCFF state priority areas

02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:29.360
and they report out

02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:31.360
this progress utilizing the template

02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:33.360
and instructions adopted

02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:35.360
by the State Board of Education.

02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:37.360
The

02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:39.360
function of the LCAP as

02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:41.360
stated within the LCAP

02:14:41.360 --> 02:14:43.360
template and instructions is

02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:45.360
threefold. It serves as

02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:47.360
a comprehensive strategic planning document.

02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:49.360
It serves

02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:51.360
as to

02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:53.360
provide a record

02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:55.360
of the meaningful engagement of educational

02:14:55.360 --> 02:14:57.360
partners that influence

02:14:57.360 --> 02:14:59.360
the development of the plan

02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:01.360
and the adjustments made to the plan

02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:03.360
and it serves

02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:05.360
a role of accountability and compliance

02:15:05.360 --> 02:15:07.360
in

02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:09.360
including demonstrating

02:15:09.360 --> 02:15:11.360
how LEAs are meeting

02:15:11.360 --> 02:15:13.360
the requirement to increase or

02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:15.360
improve services for

02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:17.360
students that are foster youth,

02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:19.360
English learners and low income

02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:21.360
students.

02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:23.360
Within the local control

02:15:23.360 --> 02:15:25.360
funding formula

02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:27.360
those three student groups are collectively

02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:29.360
referred to as the unduplicated

02:15:29.360 --> 02:15:31.360
student groups because an

02:15:31.360 --> 02:15:33.360
unduplicated count of those

02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:35.360
students generates additional

02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:37.360
funding.

02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:39.360
So going further into this

02:15:39.360 --> 02:15:41.360
requirement, the

02:15:41.360 --> 02:15:43.360
English learner student group

02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:45.360
is one of the three student groups

02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:47.360
that generate additional supplemental

02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:49.360
funding under the local control

02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:51.360
funding formula.

02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:53.360
And as a

02:15:53.360 --> 02:15:55.360
condition of receiving

02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:57.360
these funds, LEAs

02:15:57.360 --> 02:15:59.360
are required to include specific

02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:01.360
actions within

02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:03.360
the LCAP that focus

02:16:03.360 --> 02:16:05.360
on increasing or improving

02:16:05.360 --> 02:16:07.360
services for their

02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:09.360
English learner students as well

02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:11.360
as for low income and foster youth

02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:13.360
students. Now these

02:16:13.360 --> 02:16:15.360
actions are required

02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:17.360
to address or

02:16:17.360 --> 02:16:19.360
seek to address the

02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:21.360
unique identified needs of

02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:23.360
the English learner students that

02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:25.360
have been identified through a

02:16:25.360 --> 02:16:27.360
review of available state

02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:29.360
and local data as well

02:16:29.360 --> 02:16:31.360
as the input received from

02:16:31.360 --> 02:16:33.360
educational partners

02:16:33.360 --> 02:16:35.360
in the LEA's community.

02:16:35.360 --> 02:16:37.360
That available state data

02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:39.360
includes data

02:16:39.360 --> 02:16:41.360
from the dashboard, the dashboard

02:16:41.360 --> 02:16:43.360
additional reports,

02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:45.360
DataQuest, local data

02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:47.360
covers a

02:16:47.360 --> 02:16:49.360
wide range of information that's

02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:51.360
available from

02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:53.360
teachers,

02:16:53.360 --> 02:16:55.360
from report cards,

02:16:55.360 --> 02:16:57.360
from formative assessments

02:16:57.360 --> 02:16:59.360
as well as a variety of

02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:01.360
other pieces of data

02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:03.360
and the engagement from

02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:05.360
educational partners includes

02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:07.360
teachers, school

02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:09.360
staff, administrators

02:17:09.360 --> 02:17:11.360
and most importantly parents and students

02:17:11.360 --> 02:17:13.360
that are served by

02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:15.360
that LEA.

02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:17.360
The LCAP is required

02:17:17.360 --> 02:17:19.360
to include descriptions

02:17:19.360 --> 02:17:21.360
of how these

02:17:21.360 --> 02:17:23.360
contributing actions, these actions

02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:25.360
that are described as

02:17:25.360 --> 02:17:27.360
contributing towards meeting the requirement

02:17:27.360 --> 02:17:29.360
to increase or improve services

02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:31.360
are in fact

02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:33.360
an increase or improve service

02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:35.360
as compared to the services that

02:17:35.360 --> 02:17:37.360
are being provided to all students

02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:39.360
within the LEA during

02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:41.360
the school year.

02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:45.360
In addition, there are

02:17:45.360 --> 02:17:47.360
some other requirements

02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:49.360
specific to the English learner

02:17:49.360 --> 02:17:51.360
student group.

02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:53.360
All LEA's that serve

02:17:53.360 --> 02:17:55.360
a numerically significant number

02:17:55.360 --> 02:17:57.360
of English learner students, that is

02:17:57.360 --> 02:17:59.360
30 or more English learner students

02:17:59.360 --> 02:18:01.360
are required to include

02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:03.360
additional specific actions

02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:05.360
within the LCAP.

02:18:05.360 --> 02:18:07.360
At a minimum, those

02:18:07.360 --> 02:18:09.360
actions have to address

02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:11.360
the language acquisition programs

02:18:11.360 --> 02:18:13.360
that are provided to students

02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:15.360
by the LEA and

02:18:15.360 --> 02:18:17.360
the professional development

02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:19.360
activities that are being provided

02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:21.360
for staff that

02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:23.360
are serving EL students.

02:18:23.360 --> 02:18:25.360
And again, that's

02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:27.360
required for any LEA

02:18:27.360 --> 02:18:29.360
that is serving 30 or more

02:18:29.360 --> 02:18:31.360
English learner students.

02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:33.360
In addition to

02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:35.360
some specific action

02:18:35.360 --> 02:18:37.360
requirements,

02:18:37.360 --> 02:18:39.360
within the LCAP, there is also

02:18:39.360 --> 02:18:41.360
a requirement related to measures of

02:18:41.360 --> 02:18:43.360
progress. And

02:18:43.360 --> 02:18:45.360
when measuring progress,

02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:47.360
LEA's are required to identify

02:18:47.360 --> 02:18:49.360
metrics that are going to be used

02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:51.360
to track progress.

02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:53.360
They're

02:18:53.360 --> 02:18:55.360
required to

02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:57.360
include specific

02:18:57.360 --> 02:18:59.360
metrics that are outlined within

02:18:59.360 --> 02:19:01.360
statute.

02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:03.360
Related to

02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:05.360
priority four, academic achievement,

02:19:05.360 --> 02:19:07.360
priority five, student engagement,

02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:09.360
and priority six, school climate.

02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:11.360
And in addition,

02:19:11.360 --> 02:19:13.360
the LCAP template instructions

02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:15.360
encourage LEA's to identify

02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:17.360
metrics for specific

02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:19.360
student groups as appropriate.

02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:21.360
Which include

02:19:21.360 --> 02:19:23.360
expected outcomes that reflect

02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:25.360
growth,

02:19:25.360 --> 02:19:27.360
growing any opportunity

02:19:27.360 --> 02:19:29.360
or performance gaps that have

02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:31.360
been identified within the plan.

02:19:31.360 --> 02:19:33.360
Now, it's also worth

02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:35.360
noting at this point in time

02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:37.360
that within the plan

02:19:37.360 --> 02:19:39.360
summary section of the LCAP

02:19:39.360 --> 02:19:41.360
at the beginning,

02:19:41.360 --> 02:19:43.360
under the identified

02:19:43.360 --> 02:19:45.360
need reflection,

02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:47.360
LEA's are required to

02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:49.360
identify

02:19:49.360 --> 02:19:51.360
any performance gaps

02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:53.360
or any student

02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:55.360
groups that are performing significantly

02:19:55.360 --> 02:19:57.360
lower than other

02:19:57.360 --> 02:19:59.360
student groups as identified

02:19:59.360 --> 02:20:01.360
on the dashboard. And so

02:20:01.360 --> 02:20:03.360
2022,

02:20:03.360 --> 02:20:05.360
the dashboard for 2022,

02:20:05.360 --> 02:20:07.360
will be the first time in the last

02:20:07.360 --> 02:20:09.360
few years that we'll actually

02:20:09.360 --> 02:20:11.360
have that status

02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:13.360
data to inform

02:20:13.360 --> 02:20:15.360
the information that's going

02:20:15.360 --> 02:20:17.360
to show up within that particular

02:20:17.360 --> 02:20:19.360
prompt.

02:20:21.360 --> 02:20:23.360
So there are

02:20:23.360 --> 02:20:25.360
within statute some specific

02:20:25.360 --> 02:20:27.360
measures of

02:20:27.360 --> 02:20:29.360
progress related to

02:20:29.360 --> 02:20:31.360
the English learner subgroup.

02:20:31.360 --> 02:20:33.360
First of all

02:20:33.360 --> 02:20:35.360
is the percentage of students

02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:37.360
who are English learners

02:20:37.360 --> 02:20:39.360
that make progress towards English

02:20:39.360 --> 02:20:41.360
proficiency as measured by

02:20:41.360 --> 02:20:43.360
the English language proficiency

02:20:43.360 --> 02:20:45.360
assessment for California or the LPAC.

02:20:45.360 --> 02:20:47.360
And secondly,

02:20:47.360 --> 02:20:49.360
the English learner reclassification

02:20:49.360 --> 02:20:51.360
rate. However, in addition

02:20:51.360 --> 02:20:53.360
to these specific

02:20:53.360 --> 02:20:55.360
required metrics,

02:20:55.360 --> 02:20:57.360
there's also

02:20:57.360 --> 02:20:59.360
a requirement in the

02:20:59.360 --> 02:21:01.360
LCAP template that

02:21:01.360 --> 02:21:03.360
for state priorities

02:21:03.360 --> 02:21:05.360
where there is not

02:21:05.360 --> 02:21:07.360
a specific required

02:21:07.360 --> 02:21:09.360
metric identified,

02:21:09.360 --> 02:21:11.360
the LEA needs

02:21:11.360 --> 02:21:13.360
to identify one or more

02:21:13.360 --> 02:21:15.360
specific metrics in

02:21:15.360 --> 02:21:17.360
order to measure progress relative

02:21:17.360 --> 02:21:19.360
to that state priority area.

02:21:19.360 --> 02:21:21.360
So for example, in state priority

02:21:21.360 --> 02:21:23.360
two,

02:21:23.360 --> 02:21:25.360
part of state priority two

02:21:25.360 --> 02:21:27.360
is

02:21:27.360 --> 02:21:29.360
the extent to

02:21:29.360 --> 02:21:31.360
which programs and services

02:21:31.360 --> 02:21:33.360
enable English learner students

02:21:33.360 --> 02:21:35.360
to access the common core state standards

02:21:35.360 --> 02:21:37.360
and the English language development standards

02:21:37.360 --> 02:21:39.360
for purposes of gaining academic

02:21:39.360 --> 02:21:41.360
content, knowledge, and English

02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:43.360
language proficiency.

02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:45.360
There is no statutory

02:21:45.360 --> 02:21:47.360
specified metric for that

02:21:47.360 --> 02:21:49.360
particular requirement

02:21:49.360 --> 02:21:51.360
within the state priorities.

02:21:51.360 --> 02:21:53.360
Therefore, LEAs are required

02:21:53.360 --> 02:21:55.360
to identify

02:21:55.360 --> 02:21:57.360
a specific metric of how

02:21:57.360 --> 02:21:59.360
they're tracking progress towards

02:21:59.360 --> 02:22:01.360
that within the LCAP.

02:22:01.360 --> 02:22:03.360
It's also something that needs

02:22:03.360 --> 02:22:05.360
to be measured and reported out

02:22:05.360 --> 02:22:07.360
as part of the priority

02:22:07.360 --> 02:22:09.360
two local indicator

02:22:09.360 --> 02:22:11.360
which is reported on

02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:13.360
to the public on the dashboard.

02:22:13.360 --> 02:22:15.360
In addition,

02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:17.360
as part of the template

02:22:17.360 --> 02:22:19.360
and as part of the instructions

02:22:19.360 --> 02:22:21.360
for the LCAP template, LEAs

02:22:21.360 --> 02:22:23.360
are encouraged to use metrics

02:22:23.360 --> 02:22:25.360
that are based on and reported through

02:22:25.360 --> 02:22:27.360
these self-reflection

02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:29.360
tools for local indicators

02:22:29.360 --> 02:22:31.360
that are reported on the dashboard.

02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:33.360
In each of the

02:22:33.360 --> 02:22:35.360
local indicators, LEAs are required

02:22:35.360 --> 02:22:37.360
to identify

02:22:37.360 --> 02:22:39.360
and measure progress

02:22:39.360 --> 02:22:41.360
towards implementing these various

02:22:41.360 --> 02:22:43.360
what are referred to as local

02:22:43.360 --> 02:22:45.360
indicators within the dashboard

02:22:45.360 --> 02:22:47.360
and

02:22:47.360 --> 02:22:49.360
that data should

02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:51.360
also be used to inform

02:22:51.360 --> 02:22:53.360
the development and the annual

02:22:53.360 --> 02:22:55.360
update of the LCAP.

02:22:55.360 --> 02:22:57.360
In addition,

02:22:57.360 --> 02:22:59.360
LEAs are encouraged to focus

02:22:59.360 --> 02:23:01.360
on a set of metrics and actions

02:23:01.360 --> 02:23:03.360
that the LEA believes

02:23:03.360 --> 02:23:05.360
based on input that they've gathered

02:23:05.360 --> 02:23:07.360
from educational partners, based

02:23:07.360 --> 02:23:09.360
on educational research,

02:23:09.360 --> 02:23:11.360
based on experience

02:23:11.360 --> 02:23:13.360
either of their LEA or

02:23:13.360 --> 02:23:15.360
other LEAs

02:23:15.360 --> 02:23:17.360
of those things that will have

02:23:17.360 --> 02:23:19.360
the biggest impact on behalf

02:23:19.360 --> 02:23:21.360
of their TK through 12th grade

02:23:21.360 --> 02:23:23.360
students.

02:23:23.360 --> 02:23:25.360
So at this point in time,

02:23:25.360 --> 02:23:27.360
I'm going to pause and

02:23:27.360 --> 02:23:29.360
I'm going to invite our colleagues

02:23:29.360 --> 02:23:31.360
from the Sacramento County Office of Education

02:23:31.360 --> 02:23:33.360
to speak with

02:23:33.360 --> 02:23:35.360
you on their role

02:23:35.360 --> 02:23:37.360
within

02:23:37.360 --> 02:23:39.360
supporting the

02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:41.360
districts within Sacramento County

02:23:41.360 --> 02:23:43.360
as well as the specific

02:23:43.360 --> 02:23:45.360
training that they provide

02:23:45.360 --> 02:23:47.360
relative to

02:23:47.360 --> 02:23:49.360
English learners and

02:23:49.360 --> 02:23:51.360
the LCAP development.

02:23:51.360 --> 02:23:53.360
Great.

02:23:53.360 --> 02:23:55.360
Thank you, Josh.

02:23:55.360 --> 02:23:57.360
I'm very honored to

02:23:57.360 --> 02:23:59.360
follow CDE's leader, Cindy

02:23:59.360 --> 02:24:01.360
Kazanis, Josh Strong, in your presentation.

02:24:01.360 --> 02:24:03.360
Good morning, President

02:24:03.360 --> 02:24:05.360
Darling Hammond, Vice President

02:24:05.360 --> 02:24:07.360
Glover Woods, board members,

02:24:07.360 --> 02:24:09.360
CDE staff, board staff.

02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:11.360
It's with pleasure that I'm

02:24:11.360 --> 02:24:13.360
here today with my colleagues, Kathy

02:24:13.360 --> 02:24:15.360
Morrison and Graciela Garcia

02:24:15.360 --> 02:24:17.360
Torres from Sacramento County

02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:19.360
Office of Education.

02:24:19.360 --> 02:24:21.360
We're excited to share with you today

02:24:21.360 --> 02:24:23.360
a look at how we support LEAs in our

02:24:23.360 --> 02:24:25.360
county in writing LCAP goals and

02:24:25.360 --> 02:24:27.360
actions that translate

02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:29.360
to effective and impactful

02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:31.360
decisions that benefit learners in their

02:24:31.360 --> 02:24:33.360
systems. You can go to the

02:24:33.360 --> 02:24:35.360
next slide.

02:24:35.360 --> 02:24:37.360
So this

02:24:37.360 --> 02:24:39.360
morning, in our department

02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:41.360
actually at SCOE, we have the

02:24:41.360 --> 02:24:43.360
unique pleasure of providing

02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:45.360
technical assistance to LEAs through the

02:24:45.360 --> 02:24:47.360
development of their LCAPs and

02:24:47.360 --> 02:24:49.360
other state plans as well as synthesizing

02:24:49.360 --> 02:24:51.360
the information provided by the department

02:24:51.360 --> 02:24:53.360
so that it can be applied

02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:55.360
thoughtfully and in such a way

02:24:55.360 --> 02:24:57.360
that the actions and services directly

02:24:57.360 --> 02:24:59.360
impact student outcomes.

02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:01.360
We're invited here today

02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:03.360
to provide a real life example of

02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:05.360
the type of training that county offices

02:25:05.360 --> 02:25:07.360
provide that supports

02:25:07.360 --> 02:25:09.360
that LCAP development, highlighting

02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:11.360
the areas that data

02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:13.360
can be used as the plan is created,

02:25:13.360 --> 02:25:15.360
especially for English learners.

02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:17.360
So I'm going to start by

02:25:17.360 --> 02:25:19.360
sharing a bit of background on the Sacramento

02:25:19.360 --> 02:25:21.360
County Office of Ed and our

02:25:21.360 --> 02:25:23.360
theory of action for our work.

02:25:23.360 --> 02:25:25.360
And then Kathy Morrison will outline

02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:27.360
how we at SCOE develop

02:25:27.360 --> 02:25:29.360
and deliver LCAP professional

02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:31.360
learning, and then Graciela will wrap us

02:25:31.360 --> 02:25:33.360
up and share the way we approach

02:25:33.360 --> 02:25:35.360
supporting LEAs in

02:25:35.360 --> 02:25:37.360
understanding and using

02:25:37.360 --> 02:25:39.360
EL data and outcomes

02:25:39.360 --> 02:25:41.360
to drive improvement. So

02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:43.360
just a little bit about

02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:45.360
Sacramento County, kind of by the numbers.

02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:47.360
We serve

02:25:47.360 --> 02:25:49.360
about 250,000

02:25:49.360 --> 02:25:51.360
students that are enrolled

02:25:51.360 --> 02:25:53.360
in 13 districts and 51

02:25:53.360 --> 02:25:55.360
charter schools in Sacramento County.

02:25:55.360 --> 02:25:57.360
There's a vast range

02:25:57.360 --> 02:25:59.360
of enrollment in those 13 districts

02:25:59.360 --> 02:26:01.360
that we serve, from the smallest

02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:03.360
being about 246 students

02:26:03.360 --> 02:26:05.360
to over 60,000

02:26:05.360 --> 02:26:07.360
in the largest district.

02:26:07.360 --> 02:26:09.360
So the support that we

02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:11.360
provide to LEAs on their LCAP

02:26:11.360 --> 02:26:13.360
really varies based on their size and on

02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:15.360
each district's capacity.

02:26:15.360 --> 02:26:17.360
So for example, in some of our smallest districts

02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:19.360
that don't have the same number

02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:21.360
of dedicated employees that are working

02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:23.360
on pulling in information

02:26:23.360 --> 02:26:25.360
and writing that LCAP, we might

02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:27.360
provide a more customized support

02:26:27.360 --> 02:26:29.360
to them.

02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:31.360
And our support

02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:33.360
in general is varied.

02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:35.360
So we have

02:26:35.360 --> 02:26:37.360
monthly meetings. We

02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:39.360
provide one-on-one consultation

02:26:39.360 --> 02:26:41.360
and small group meetings with similarly

02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:43.360
sized or

02:26:43.360 --> 02:26:45.360
resourced districts.

02:26:45.360 --> 02:26:47.360
We also debrief state-level

02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:49.360
trainings, practice data protocols,

02:26:49.360 --> 02:26:51.360
and hold writing sessions.

02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:53.360
And districts can opt

02:26:53.360 --> 02:26:55.360
in and out of those as they need.

02:26:55.360 --> 02:26:57.360
Because our

02:26:57.360 --> 02:26:59.360
county is widely dispersed geographically,

02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:01.360
a bright spot of COVID has been

02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:03.360
that we've had greater attendance

02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:05.360
because we can use remote applications

02:27:05.360 --> 02:27:07.360
for our workshops and travel time

02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:09.360
is eliminated, which

02:27:09.360 --> 02:27:11.360
makes a big difference for really busy district

02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:13.360
leaders. And go to the next slide.

02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:15.360
So a little

02:27:15.360 --> 02:27:17.360
bit more about our students.

02:27:17.360 --> 02:27:19.360
Sacramento County is one of the most

02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:21.360
diverse counties in the state.

02:27:21.360 --> 02:27:23.360
As you can see, our racial and ethnic

02:27:23.360 --> 02:27:25.360
distribution has a nice spread and

02:27:25.360 --> 02:27:27.360
students fall into a range of categories.

02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:31.360
Those unduplicated categories that

02:27:31.360 --> 02:27:33.360
Josh was alluding to earlier

02:27:33.360 --> 02:27:35.360
that indicate a greater need in more individualized

02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:37.360
supports.

02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:39.360
The English learner student population is

02:27:39.360 --> 02:27:41.360
around 42,000 students with

02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:43.360
almost 30,000

02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:45.360
more students that are reclassified as

02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:47.360
fluent in our county.

02:27:47.360 --> 02:27:49.360
We have a wide diversity of languages

02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:51.360
presented. Spanish is the most frequent

02:27:51.360 --> 02:27:53.360
language identified with 15%

02:27:53.360 --> 02:27:55.360
of EL speakers

02:27:55.360 --> 02:27:57.360
are speakers of Spanish.

02:27:57.360 --> 02:27:59.360
However, many more languages,

02:27:59.360 --> 02:28:01.360
almost 70,

02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:03.360
are spoken throughout the county.

02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:05.360
So next slide.

02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:07.360
Several years ago,

02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:09.360
when the Dashboard first

02:28:09.360 --> 02:28:11.360
came out, our internal SCOE team

02:28:11.360 --> 02:28:13.360
spent some time articulating

02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:15.360
a theory of action for how our support

02:28:15.360 --> 02:28:17.360
would look and feel for districts.

02:28:17.360 --> 02:28:19.360
And our theory of action is here on this slide.

02:28:19.360 --> 02:28:21.360
We believe that if we

02:28:21.360 --> 02:28:23.360
assist our districts in building their

02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:25.360
capacity to improve and identify

02:28:25.360 --> 02:28:27.360
practices that ensure every child

02:28:27.360 --> 02:28:29.360
has access to a high quality

02:28:29.360 --> 02:28:31.360
education and individualized

02:28:31.360 --> 02:28:33.360
social and emotional learning supports,

02:28:33.360 --> 02:28:35.360
then every child will achieve their greatest

02:28:35.360 --> 02:28:37.360
potential in life.

02:28:37.360 --> 02:28:39.360
We understand our role

02:28:39.360 --> 02:28:41.360
to be more than just LCAP

02:28:41.360 --> 02:28:43.360
technical support or providing DA,

02:28:43.360 --> 02:28:45.360
but really a coordinated and

02:28:45.360 --> 02:28:47.360
connected set of supports

02:28:47.360 --> 02:28:49.360
that work together to improve student

02:28:49.360 --> 02:28:51.360
experiences and

02:28:51.360 --> 02:28:53.360
achievement in schools.

02:28:53.360 --> 02:28:55.360
So keeping that ultimate goal

02:28:55.360 --> 02:28:57.360
in mind, we've landed on an approach

02:28:57.360 --> 02:28:59.360
that we believe works really well.

02:28:59.360 --> 02:29:01.360
At the heart of our work is a belief

02:29:01.360 --> 02:29:03.360
in continuous improvement where we spend

02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:05.360
intentional time reflecting on

02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:07.360
how impactful our support is.

02:29:07.360 --> 02:29:09.360
And to do that, we take feedback

02:29:09.360 --> 02:29:11.360
from our own colleagues

02:29:11.360 --> 02:29:13.360
within the county office. We calibrate

02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:15.360
with county offices across our region

02:29:15.360 --> 02:29:17.360
and the state. And most importantly, we

02:29:17.360 --> 02:29:19.360
take and use feedback from our LEAs

02:29:19.360 --> 02:29:21.360
that we serve

02:29:21.360 --> 02:29:23.360
to ensure that the support we're providing

02:29:23.360 --> 02:29:25.360
is really landing for them in a way that

02:29:25.360 --> 02:29:27.360
works well for their needs.

02:29:27.360 --> 02:29:29.360
Next slide.

02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:31.360
So supporting

02:29:31.360 --> 02:29:33.360
LEAs in their LCAP development is

02:29:33.360 --> 02:29:35.360
a concrete way that districts

02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:37.360
and charter schools can communicate their strategic

02:29:37.360 --> 02:29:39.360
plans around improving outcomes

02:29:39.360 --> 02:29:41.360
for students. The

02:29:41.360 --> 02:29:43.360
south LCAP, as you know, is a complex

02:29:43.360 --> 02:29:45.360
document, and each one

02:29:45.360 --> 02:29:47.360
as the

02:29:47.360 --> 02:29:49.360
role of the county office

02:29:49.360 --> 02:29:51.360
is really multifaceted. So

02:29:51.360 --> 02:29:53.360
we're the support provider, the reviewer,

02:29:53.360 --> 02:29:55.360
the approver of each

02:29:55.360 --> 02:29:57.360
LCAP. And as we read, we're looking

02:29:57.360 --> 02:29:59.360
really to see a through line that starts

02:29:59.360 --> 02:30:01.360
with the students reflecting

02:30:01.360 --> 02:30:03.360
their successes and challenges that need to be

02:30:03.360 --> 02:30:05.360
addressed and really centers the feedback

02:30:05.360 --> 02:30:07.360
from a wide array of educational

02:30:07.360 --> 02:30:09.360
partners. And then we

02:30:09.360 --> 02:30:11.360
learn how the district plans to increase

02:30:11.360 --> 02:30:13.360
or improve services for their high need students,

02:30:13.360 --> 02:30:15.360
as well as all student

02:30:15.360 --> 02:30:17.360
groups that are demonstrating needs, even those

02:30:17.360 --> 02:30:19.360
that don't fall into the unduplicated category.

02:30:19.360 --> 02:30:21.360
So as we consult

02:30:21.360 --> 02:30:23.360
with districts and guide the development of

02:30:23.360 --> 02:30:25.360
the LCAP, we remind them to consider student

02:30:25.360 --> 02:30:27.360
needs first. We prompt

02:30:27.360 --> 02:30:29.360
them by asking questions like

02:30:29.360 --> 02:30:31.360
whose needs is the

02:30:31.360 --> 02:30:33.360
LCAP designed to serve? What are those

02:30:33.360 --> 02:30:35.360
needs? What actions and services have been

02:30:35.360 --> 02:30:37.360
effective at addressing those needs?

02:30:37.360 --> 02:30:39.360
What needs to be modified

02:30:39.360 --> 02:30:41.360
or expanded or re-examined?

02:30:41.360 --> 02:30:43.360
Ultimately, our goal

02:30:43.360 --> 02:30:45.360
is to adhere to what's written in statute

02:30:45.360 --> 02:30:47.360
and Ed code and always seeking

02:30:47.360 --> 02:30:49.360
really to operationalize the spirit

02:30:49.360 --> 02:30:51.360
of those policies. That is, we're not

02:30:51.360 --> 02:30:53.360
the compliance police. Instead,

02:30:53.360 --> 02:30:55.360
we want to support our districts

02:30:55.360 --> 02:30:57.360
in leveraging documents

02:30:57.360 --> 02:30:59.360
like the LCAP to be the entry point

02:30:59.360 --> 02:31:01.360
for lasting structural, institutional

02:31:01.360 --> 02:31:03.360
and even mindset change

02:31:03.360 --> 02:31:05.360
within each system.

02:31:05.360 --> 02:31:07.360
At this point, I'm going to turn it over to

02:31:07.360 --> 02:31:09.360
Kathy Morrison to share more about

02:31:09.360 --> 02:31:11.360
the process and the inputs

02:31:11.360 --> 02:31:13.360
that we use to help develop our

02:31:13.360 --> 02:31:15.360
LCAP workshops and technical assistance.

02:31:15.360 --> 02:31:17.360
So, Kathy.

02:31:17.360 --> 02:31:19.360
Good morning, President

02:31:19.360 --> 02:31:21.360
Darling-Hammond, members of the State Board

02:31:21.360 --> 02:31:23.360
of Education. I'm Kathy Morrison,

02:31:23.360 --> 02:31:25.360
coordinator of local

02:31:25.360 --> 02:31:27.360
district support services

02:31:27.360 --> 02:31:29.360
and accountability

02:31:29.360 --> 02:31:31.360
for the Sacramento County Office of

02:31:31.360 --> 02:31:33.360
Education.

02:31:33.360 --> 02:31:35.360
You can go on, please.

02:31:35.360 --> 02:31:37.360
In my role, I plan and

02:31:37.360 --> 02:31:39.360
coordinate our county's LCAP

02:31:39.360 --> 02:31:41.360
professional development and LCAP review

02:31:41.360 --> 02:31:43.360
process. There are a number of

02:31:43.360 --> 02:31:45.360
inputs used to develop LCAP

02:31:45.360 --> 02:31:47.360
technical assistance.

02:31:47.360 --> 02:31:49.360
The foundation is California Education

02:31:49.360 --> 02:31:51.360
Code. We follow relevant

02:31:51.360 --> 02:31:53.360
legislation and incorporate

02:31:53.360 --> 02:31:55.360
enacted policy changes

02:31:55.360 --> 02:31:57.360
into our technical assistance.

02:31:57.360 --> 02:31:59.360
Most recently, Assembly Bill

02:31:59.360 --> 02:32:01.360
1868 established

02:32:01.360 --> 02:32:03.360
that reporting process for

02:32:03.360 --> 02:32:05.360
English learner achievement data

02:32:05.360 --> 02:32:07.360
that includes outcomes

02:32:07.360 --> 02:32:09.360
for long-term English learners,

02:32:09.360 --> 02:32:11.360
students at risk for

02:32:11.360 --> 02:32:13.360
becoming a long-term English learner,

02:32:13.360 --> 02:32:15.360
and ELs who have been

02:32:15.360 --> 02:32:17.360
reclassified as fluent.

02:32:17.360 --> 02:32:19.360
This is our opportunity to highlight

02:32:19.360 --> 02:32:21.360
these new data and help our districts

02:32:21.360 --> 02:32:23.360
potentially identify areas

02:32:23.360 --> 02:32:25.360
of need that can be addressed through the

02:32:25.360 --> 02:32:27.360
LCAP. We emphasize

02:32:27.360 --> 02:32:29.360
a careful read of the LCAP instructions

02:32:29.360 --> 02:32:31.360
as they carry the full force of the law

02:32:31.360 --> 02:32:33.360
and attend workshops

02:32:33.360 --> 02:32:35.360
and office hours offered by CDE

02:32:35.360 --> 02:32:37.360
to understand

02:32:37.360 --> 02:32:39.360
the key points that we need to

02:32:39.360 --> 02:32:41.360
emphasize. SCOE

02:32:41.360 --> 02:32:43.360
is also an anchor

02:32:43.360 --> 02:32:45.360
County Office of Education for the

02:32:45.360 --> 02:32:47.360
EL RISE Institute.

02:32:47.360 --> 02:32:49.360
My colleague Graciela will describe

02:32:49.360 --> 02:32:51.360
in a moment how we embed

02:32:51.360 --> 02:32:53.360
elements of these materials

02:32:53.360 --> 02:32:55.360
into our trainings.

02:32:55.360 --> 02:32:57.360
And finally, with our county peers, we attend

02:32:57.360 --> 02:32:59.360
workshops offered by the California County

02:32:59.360 --> 02:33:01.360
Superintendents Association,

02:33:01.360 --> 02:33:03.360
utilize the LCAP review manual,

02:33:03.360 --> 02:33:05.360
and participate in those

02:33:05.360 --> 02:33:07.360
calibration calls where we share

02:33:07.360 --> 02:33:09.360
strategies and best practices.

02:33:09.360 --> 02:33:11.360
Next, please.

02:33:13.360 --> 02:33:15.360
Shawna mentioned how

02:33:15.360 --> 02:33:17.360
we focus on the needs of our users

02:33:17.360 --> 02:33:19.360
as we design our workshops.

02:33:19.360 --> 02:33:21.360
And that encompasses many things,

02:33:21.360 --> 02:33:23.360
district demographics,

02:33:23.360 --> 02:33:25.360
data, the resources

02:33:25.360 --> 02:33:27.360
they have in terms of staff

02:33:27.360 --> 02:33:29.360
and time.

02:33:29.360 --> 02:33:31.360
We also reflect on our

02:33:31.360 --> 02:33:33.360
prior year's LCAP process

02:33:33.360 --> 02:33:35.360
to see if we need to make any adaptations

02:33:35.360 --> 02:33:37.360
to scheduling.

02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:39.360
For workshops,

02:33:39.360 --> 02:33:41.360
whenever possible, we think it's important

02:33:41.360 --> 02:33:43.360
to invite participation

02:33:43.360 --> 02:33:45.360
from local districts so

02:33:45.360 --> 02:33:47.360
there can be some peer-to-peer learning.

02:33:47.360 --> 02:33:49.360
And we also

02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:51.360
study the

02:33:51.360 --> 02:33:53.360
adopted LCAPs.

02:33:53.360 --> 02:33:55.360
We note areas that could be strengthened

02:33:55.360 --> 02:33:57.360
and then double down on

02:33:57.360 --> 02:33:59.360
workshopping our materials to communicate

02:33:59.360 --> 02:34:01.360
in multiple ways the content

02:34:01.360 --> 02:34:03.360
areas that need to be reinforced.

02:34:05.360 --> 02:34:07.360
I want to make a note that our

02:34:07.360 --> 02:34:09.360
planning and improvement team is

02:34:09.360 --> 02:34:11.360
part of a multidisciplinary

02:34:11.360 --> 02:34:13.360
EL RISE initiative

02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:15.360
within our county office.

02:34:15.360 --> 02:34:17.360
And with this team, we studied

02:34:17.360 --> 02:34:19.360
the EL roadmap principles

02:34:19.360 --> 02:34:21.360
and we were challenged

02:34:21.360 --> 02:34:23.360
to identify an area of improvement

02:34:23.360 --> 02:34:25.360
that would

02:34:25.360 --> 02:34:27.360
be specific to our locus of control

02:34:27.360 --> 02:34:29.360
aligned to one of the principles.

02:34:29.360 --> 02:34:31.360
And so our team's

02:34:31.360 --> 02:34:33.360
aim is to support and

02:34:33.360 --> 02:34:35.360
encourage greater evidence of

02:34:35.360 --> 02:34:37.360
disaggregated data for English

02:34:37.360 --> 02:34:39.360
learners in LCAPs.

02:34:39.360 --> 02:34:41.360
And we are planning now what we might change

02:34:41.360 --> 02:34:43.360
in order to see greater evidence

02:34:43.360 --> 02:34:45.360
of that data.

02:34:45.360 --> 02:34:47.360
Next slide, please.

02:34:47.360 --> 02:34:49.360
So on this slide,

02:34:49.360 --> 02:34:51.360
we wanted to visualize examples

02:34:51.360 --> 02:34:53.360
of how we convey information

02:34:53.360 --> 02:34:55.360
in a workshop.

02:34:55.360 --> 02:34:57.360
We've been working in a virtual setting for

02:34:57.360 --> 02:34:59.360
two and a half years and so we've had to

02:34:59.360 --> 02:35:01.360
use some techniques of learning design

02:35:01.360 --> 02:35:03.360
that strike a balance between

02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:05.360
creating warm and active engagement

02:35:05.360 --> 02:35:07.360
for attendees and also

02:35:07.360 --> 02:35:09.360
clearly conveying key pieces

02:35:09.360 --> 02:35:11.360
of information.

02:35:11.360 --> 02:35:13.360
Previously, we've mentioned responding to needs

02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:15.360
of our users and the

02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:17.360
blue checkmarks that you see here

02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:19.360
were included to signify the most

02:35:19.360 --> 02:35:21.360
important information.

02:35:21.360 --> 02:35:23.360
This was our response

02:35:23.360 --> 02:35:25.360
to feedback received on a

02:35:25.360 --> 02:35:27.360
prior workshop. A participant

02:35:27.360 --> 02:35:29.360
suggested, and this is

02:35:29.360 --> 02:35:31.360
a quote, so it's a little awkward,

02:35:31.360 --> 02:35:33.360
that we add what's new,

02:35:33.360 --> 02:35:35.360
different, that you need

02:35:35.360 --> 02:35:37.360
to watch out for so you don't trip

02:35:37.360 --> 02:35:39.360
up to address gaps and

02:35:39.360 --> 02:35:41.360
red flags that we may experience.

02:35:43.360 --> 02:35:45.360
There's a lot to putting together

02:35:45.360 --> 02:35:47.360
in LCAP and it's

02:35:47.360 --> 02:35:49.360
our belief that

02:35:49.360 --> 02:35:51.360
if the basic elements of a presentation

02:35:51.360 --> 02:35:53.360
aren't clearly understood,

02:35:53.360 --> 02:35:55.360
we must take time to review and

02:35:55.360 --> 02:35:57.360
reinforce them.

02:35:57.360 --> 02:35:59.360
Next, please.

02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:01.360
We believe that our strongest

02:36:01.360 --> 02:36:03.360
lever for supporting an

02:36:03.360 --> 02:36:05.360
effective and impactful LCAP is working

02:36:05.360 --> 02:36:07.360
with the district

02:36:07.360 --> 02:36:09.360
staff during the development phase.

02:36:09.360 --> 02:36:11.360
That's the time of greatest

02:36:11.360 --> 02:36:13.360
influence. We encourage

02:36:13.360 --> 02:36:15.360
every district to share their

02:36:15.360 --> 02:36:17.360
LCAP in a pre-review.

02:36:17.360 --> 02:36:19.360
Some of them will chunk it out.

02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:21.360
We then use the California

02:36:21.360 --> 02:36:23.360
County Superintendent's

02:36:23.360 --> 02:36:25.360
Association LCAP review tool

02:36:25.360 --> 02:36:27.360
to indicate where

02:36:27.360 --> 02:36:29.360
the district has provided

02:36:29.360 --> 02:36:31.360
evidence of meeting requirements

02:36:31.360 --> 02:36:33.360
and where they need additional coaching.

02:36:33.360 --> 02:36:35.360
We provided a little example

02:36:35.360 --> 02:36:37.360
of this type of communication

02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:39.360
on this slide.

02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:41.360
Finally, we're open to support

02:36:41.360 --> 02:36:43.360
LCAP writers in any modality

02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:45.360
that works for them in that development

02:36:45.360 --> 02:36:47.360
process. We've had drop-in

02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:49.360
Zoom office hours,

02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:51.360
ad hoc meetings scheduled

02:36:51.360 --> 02:36:53.360
to fine-tune specific

02:36:53.360 --> 02:36:55.360
LCAP content areas.

02:36:55.360 --> 02:36:57.360
With some districts, we just

02:36:57.360 --> 02:36:59.360
schedule a regular

02:36:59.360 --> 02:37:01.360
bi-weekly or monthly check-in

02:37:01.360 --> 02:37:03.360
on the LCAP and other accountability

02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:05.360
concerns. And we have

02:37:05.360 --> 02:37:07.360
found some success in grouping

02:37:07.360 --> 02:37:09.360
meetings by district size

02:37:09.360 --> 02:37:11.360
since the needs are so different

02:37:11.360 --> 02:37:13.360
based on student enrollment.

02:37:13.360 --> 02:37:15.360
Next, please.

02:37:15.360 --> 02:37:17.360
This suggested

02:37:17.360 --> 02:37:19.360
timeline helps our LEAs

02:37:19.360 --> 02:37:21.360
to visualize where

02:37:21.360 --> 02:37:23.360
they will need to

02:37:23.360 --> 02:37:25.360
be throughout the

02:37:25.360 --> 02:37:27.360
LCAP cycle.

02:37:27.360 --> 02:37:29.360
For county offices, the release

02:37:29.360 --> 02:37:31.360
of the 2022 dashboard

02:37:31.360 --> 02:37:33.360
and the data analysis

02:37:33.360 --> 02:37:35.360
that our county team will initiate

02:37:35.360 --> 02:37:37.360
will set our technical assistance

02:37:37.360 --> 02:37:39.360
in motion.

02:37:39.360 --> 02:37:41.360
While a mid-year report on the

02:37:41.360 --> 02:37:43.360
LCAP is not required,

02:37:43.360 --> 02:37:45.360
we continue to encourage

02:37:45.360 --> 02:37:47.360
it as a best practice for

02:37:47.360 --> 02:37:49.360
reflection and for transparency

02:37:49.360 --> 02:37:51.360
with educational partners.

02:37:51.360 --> 02:37:53.360
Our English

02:37:53.360 --> 02:37:55.360
learner curriculum specialist

02:37:55.360 --> 02:37:57.360
is a partner in this process from

02:37:57.360 --> 02:37:59.360
designing workshops to LCAP review.

02:37:59.360 --> 02:38:01.360
My colleague Graciela

02:38:01.360 --> 02:38:03.360
will now provide specific

02:38:03.360 --> 02:38:05.360
information about how county offices

02:38:05.360 --> 02:38:07.360
encourage and support

02:38:07.360 --> 02:38:09.360
the review of data that pertains

02:38:09.360 --> 02:38:11.360
to English learners.

02:38:11.360 --> 02:38:13.360
Thank you, Kathy.

02:38:13.360 --> 02:38:15.360
Good morning. Linda

02:38:15.360 --> 02:38:17.360
Darling-Tammon, president of the State

02:38:17.360 --> 02:38:19.360
Board of Education and members of the

02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:21.360
board. As Kathy said,

02:38:21.360 --> 02:38:23.360
my name is Graciela Garcia-Torres

02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:25.360
and I am a curriculum specialist

02:38:25.360 --> 02:38:27.360
for English learner programs

02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:29.360
and accountability for the Sacramento

02:38:29.360 --> 02:38:31.360
County. And I'm also a

02:38:31.360 --> 02:38:33.360
regional English learner specialist.

02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:35.360
In the next slide,

02:38:35.360 --> 02:38:37.360
I get to tell you

02:38:37.360 --> 02:38:39.360
about our process.

02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:41.360
So as our county office

02:38:41.360 --> 02:38:43.360
of education English learner specialist

02:38:43.360 --> 02:38:45.360
and English learner need for region

02:38:45.360 --> 02:38:47.360
three, these are inputs

02:38:47.360 --> 02:38:49.360
that inform my work. The collaboration

02:38:49.360 --> 02:38:51.360
among the regional English

02:38:51.360 --> 02:38:53.360
learner specialist alongside the California

02:38:53.360 --> 02:38:55.360
Department of Ed Multilingual

02:38:55.360 --> 02:38:57.360
Support Division to make

02:38:57.360 --> 02:38:59.360
meaning of the legislation is essential

02:38:59.360 --> 02:39:01.360
to this process.

02:39:01.360 --> 02:39:03.360
The bilingual coordinators network

02:39:03.360 --> 02:39:05.360
and the luncheon

02:39:05.360 --> 02:39:07.360
complement and complete the required

02:39:07.360 --> 02:39:09.360
information so that then we can go ahead and

02:39:09.360 --> 02:39:11.360
share the adjusting time

02:39:11.360 --> 02:39:13.360
of the legislation and make meaning

02:39:13.360 --> 02:39:15.360
and make it relevant

02:39:15.360 --> 02:39:17.360
for our districts and in the LCAP

02:39:17.360 --> 02:39:19.360
process. As the regional lead,

02:39:19.360 --> 02:39:21.360
I have reached to 10 other counties

02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:23.360
to provide the same

02:39:23.360 --> 02:39:25.360
resources and information

02:39:25.360 --> 02:39:27.360
throughout the regional network,

02:39:27.360 --> 02:39:29.360
the multilingual education leadership

02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:31.360
network. And I am able to

02:39:31.360 --> 02:39:33.360
gather this information

02:39:33.360 --> 02:39:35.360
through the regional English

02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:37.360
learner specialist and the VC

02:39:37.360 --> 02:39:39.360
and the bilingual coordinators network and

02:39:39.360 --> 02:39:41.360
infuse it in the regional

02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:43.360
network. For the last two years,

02:39:43.360 --> 02:39:45.360
the Sacramento County Office of Education has

02:39:45.360 --> 02:39:47.360
been in collaboration

02:39:47.360 --> 02:39:49.360
with EL Rice, the English learner roadmap

02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:51.360
implementation for systemic excellence

02:39:51.360 --> 02:39:53.360
serving as an

02:39:53.360 --> 02:39:55.360
county, as Cathy said, to implement

02:39:55.360 --> 02:39:57.360
the English learner roadmap

02:39:57.360 --> 02:39:59.360
policy. And through this

02:39:59.360 --> 02:40:01.360
education workforce

02:40:01.360 --> 02:40:03.360
investment grant, or the

02:40:03.360 --> 02:40:05.360
IWA, we have offered

02:40:05.360 --> 02:40:07.360
the English learner roadmap Align

02:40:07.360 --> 02:40:09.360
LCAP toolkit using the

02:40:09.360 --> 02:40:11.360
research-based tools to

02:40:11.360 --> 02:40:13.360
promote equity for English learners.

02:40:13.360 --> 02:40:15.360
Part of our internal process

02:40:15.360 --> 02:40:17.360
with EL Rice has been

02:40:17.360 --> 02:40:19.360
to convene an internal team.

02:40:19.360 --> 02:40:21.360
And we have

02:40:21.360 --> 02:40:23.360
15 different cross-collaborative

02:40:23.360 --> 02:40:25.360
departments making

02:40:25.360 --> 02:40:27.360
meaning of the services and programs

02:40:27.360 --> 02:40:29.360
for English learners

02:40:29.360 --> 02:40:31.360
based on their context.

02:40:31.360 --> 02:40:33.360
And as Cathy mentioned, each

02:40:33.360 --> 02:40:35.360
one of these departments is involved in

02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:37.360
a plan, do, study, act

02:40:37.360 --> 02:40:39.360
cycle of improvement. They reflect

02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:41.360
upon the change ideas

02:40:41.360 --> 02:40:43.360
to better serve English learners and

02:40:43.360 --> 02:40:45.360
understand the principles of the English

02:40:45.360 --> 02:40:47.360
learner roadmap. And that is part

02:40:47.360 --> 02:40:49.360
of our process. In the next slide,

02:40:49.360 --> 02:40:51.360
you can see that

02:40:51.360 --> 02:40:53.360
being part of the Sacramento County

02:40:53.360 --> 02:40:55.360
Office of Education, LCAP

02:40:55.360 --> 02:40:57.360
technical assistance and workshops,

02:40:57.360 --> 02:40:59.360
office hours, and continued

02:40:59.360 --> 02:41:01.360
collaboration with our

02:41:01.360 --> 02:41:03.360
planning improvement team is an

02:41:03.360 --> 02:41:05.360
essential aspect to support

02:41:05.360 --> 02:41:07.360
the English learners in our county.

02:41:07.360 --> 02:41:09.360
Assisting

02:41:09.360 --> 02:41:11.360
our districts in building their

02:41:11.360 --> 02:41:13.360
capacity to improve

02:41:13.360 --> 02:41:15.360
and identify practices

02:41:15.360 --> 02:41:17.360
that ensure that every student

02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:19.360
that are English learners have access

02:41:19.360 --> 02:41:21.360
to a high quality education

02:41:21.360 --> 02:41:23.360
and do as best possible

02:41:23.360 --> 02:41:25.360
to individualize that social, emotional

02:41:25.360 --> 02:41:27.360
and learning supports

02:41:27.360 --> 02:41:29.360
is important. We use

02:41:29.360 --> 02:41:31.360
tools to offer the

02:41:31.360 --> 02:41:33.360
equitable opportunity to achieve

02:41:33.360 --> 02:41:35.360
our theory of action

02:41:35.360 --> 02:41:37.360
so that educators can also

02:41:37.360 --> 02:41:39.360
have these tools. We see

02:41:39.360 --> 02:41:41.360
the requirements of the LCAP

02:41:41.360 --> 02:41:43.360
for English learners not as

02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:45.360
an isolated areas

02:41:45.360 --> 02:41:47.360
but as interconnected concepts.

02:41:47.360 --> 02:41:49.360
The implementation of the

02:41:49.360 --> 02:41:51.360
EOD standards, the content standards,

02:41:51.360 --> 02:41:53.360
the English learner data,

02:41:53.360 --> 02:41:55.360
the professional development and

02:41:55.360 --> 02:41:57.360
the program descriptions are to

02:41:57.360 --> 02:41:59.360
build upon each other and connect.

02:41:59.360 --> 02:42:01.360
So what does that story

02:42:01.360 --> 02:42:03.360
say when we look at the data?

02:42:03.360 --> 02:42:05.360
What does it say in terms of

02:42:05.360 --> 02:42:07.360
what our students need?

02:42:07.360 --> 02:42:09.360
What does the English learner

02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:11.360
progress indicator

02:42:11.360 --> 02:42:13.360
say in terms of the student achievement

02:42:13.360 --> 02:42:15.360
in language acquisition? And then

02:42:15.360 --> 02:42:17.360
what do we know about our

02:42:17.360 --> 02:42:19.360
reclassified fluent English proficient

02:42:19.360 --> 02:42:21.360
existing data

02:42:21.360 --> 02:42:23.360
and how successful are we providing

02:42:23.360 --> 02:42:25.360
access to the content and that continued

02:42:25.360 --> 02:42:27.360
monitoring and that

02:42:27.360 --> 02:42:29.360
access to the content for our English learners

02:42:29.360 --> 02:42:31.360
in achieving language acquisition.

02:42:31.360 --> 02:42:33.360
So these tools

02:42:33.360 --> 02:42:35.360
that we provide is

02:42:35.360 --> 02:42:37.360
a process of

02:42:37.360 --> 02:42:39.360
understanding at a deeper level.

02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:41.360
In the next slide you see one of

02:42:41.360 --> 02:42:43.360
these tools and resources

02:42:43.360 --> 02:42:45.360
and so the

02:42:45.360 --> 02:42:47.360
Loyola Marymount University Center for

02:42:47.360 --> 02:42:49.360
Equity for English learners in

02:42:49.360 --> 02:42:51.360
the Californians together provide professional

02:42:51.360 --> 02:42:53.360
development and the

02:42:53.360 --> 02:42:55.360
resources for educators,

02:42:55.360 --> 02:42:57.360
families and community members.

02:42:57.360 --> 02:42:59.360
Through the EO Rise we have

02:42:59.360 --> 02:43:01.360
offered multiple sessions as

02:43:01.360 --> 02:43:03.360
an option for our districts to be

02:43:03.360 --> 02:43:05.360
part of and attend and engaged.

02:43:05.360 --> 02:43:07.360
We feel that this ensures that the LCAP

02:43:07.360 --> 02:43:09.360
reflects how actions and services

02:43:09.360 --> 02:43:11.360
and programs and

02:43:11.360 --> 02:43:13.360
resources are made available

02:43:13.360 --> 02:43:15.360
for equitable opportunities

02:43:15.360 --> 02:43:17.360
and outcomes for our English learners.

02:43:17.360 --> 02:43:19.360
These resources have

02:43:19.360 --> 02:43:21.360
focus areas and rubrics

02:43:21.360 --> 02:43:23.360
that are research-based and

02:43:23.360 --> 02:43:25.360
can infuse practices

02:43:25.360 --> 02:43:27.360
that

02:43:27.360 --> 02:43:29.360
center on our English learners

02:43:29.360 --> 02:43:31.360
and achieve those intended

02:43:31.360 --> 02:43:33.360
gains. In the next slide

02:43:35.360 --> 02:43:37.360
we see an example

02:43:37.360 --> 02:43:39.360
of what is found

02:43:39.360 --> 02:43:41.360
in this toolkit. You see the

02:43:41.360 --> 02:43:43.360
six focus areas are called

02:43:43.360 --> 02:43:45.360
out in this toolkit that

02:43:45.360 --> 02:43:47.360
provide the frame to dig

02:43:47.360 --> 02:43:49.360
deeper into how well we are

02:43:49.360 --> 02:43:51.360
focused in these actions,

02:43:51.360 --> 02:43:53.360
resources and that are requiring

02:43:53.360 --> 02:43:55.360
the LCAP. As you

02:43:55.360 --> 02:43:57.360
can tell these areas reflect

02:43:57.360 --> 02:43:59.360
the requirements of the LCAP specifically

02:43:59.360 --> 02:44:01.360
calling out English learners, student

02:44:01.360 --> 02:44:03.360
group. So one

02:44:03.360 --> 02:44:05.360
of those tools is in the next slide.

02:44:05.360 --> 02:44:07.360
And

02:44:07.360 --> 02:44:09.360
as you can see here,

02:44:09.360 --> 02:44:11.360
here's an example of the focus area

02:44:11.360 --> 02:44:13.360
in the rubric to

02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:15.360
describe the professional development.

02:44:15.360 --> 02:44:17.360
These rubrics show

02:44:17.360 --> 02:44:19.360
and serve

02:44:19.360 --> 02:44:21.360
as a guide and a reminder

02:44:21.360 --> 02:44:23.360
of what is effective

02:44:23.360 --> 02:44:25.360
and what is that

02:44:25.360 --> 02:44:27.360
implementation

02:44:27.360 --> 02:44:29.360
level that we need to see in that

02:44:29.360 --> 02:44:31.360
aspect of language

02:44:31.360 --> 02:44:33.360
that we can use as

02:44:33.360 --> 02:44:35.360
we are making these plans.

02:44:35.360 --> 02:44:37.360
Districts are encouraged to use

02:44:37.360 --> 02:44:39.360
these rubrics and to use the language

02:44:39.360 --> 02:44:41.360
to support them in the

02:44:41.360 --> 02:44:43.360
process.

02:44:43.360 --> 02:44:45.360
We strongly agree with

02:44:45.360 --> 02:44:47.360
the concept that we

02:44:47.360 --> 02:44:49.360
rather have influence in the

02:44:49.360 --> 02:44:51.360
development of the LCAP rather

02:44:51.360 --> 02:44:53.360
than making corrections during

02:44:53.360 --> 02:44:55.360
the review. In the next

02:44:55.360 --> 02:44:57.360
slide you're

02:44:57.360 --> 02:44:59.360
going to see

02:44:59.360 --> 02:45:01.360
this data. You might have seen

02:45:01.360 --> 02:45:03.360
this before. I was very pleased

02:45:03.360 --> 02:45:05.360
to hear about the new resource

02:45:05.360 --> 02:45:07.360
on disaggregated data for academic

02:45:07.360 --> 02:45:09.360
indicator. This is an example

02:45:09.360 --> 02:45:11.360
of what that means.

02:45:11.360 --> 02:45:13.360
This data came from the Loyola

02:45:13.360 --> 02:45:15.360
Marrow Mound California

02:45:15.360 --> 02:45:17.360
Californians Together presentation.

02:45:17.360 --> 02:45:19.360
And it is a part of the

02:45:19.360 --> 02:45:21.360
Californians Together

02:45:21.360 --> 02:45:23.360
framework for an effective

02:45:23.360 --> 02:45:25.360
and coherent accountability system for

02:45:25.360 --> 02:45:27.360
English learners. As you can see, it

02:45:27.360 --> 02:45:29.360
shows the importance of pulling out

02:45:29.360 --> 02:45:31.360
the varied outcomes for reclassified

02:45:31.360 --> 02:45:33.360
English learners

02:45:33.360 --> 02:45:35.360
in comparison to the

02:45:35.360 --> 02:45:37.360
English learners.

02:45:37.360 --> 02:45:39.360
This is the 2019

02:45:39.360 --> 02:45:41.360
dashboard data showing the results

02:45:41.360 --> 02:45:43.360
for the academic indicator for

02:45:43.360 --> 02:45:45.360
English language arts. The subgroup

02:45:45.360 --> 02:45:47.360
is English learner for

02:45:47.360 --> 02:45:49.360
districts that have 30 or more

02:45:49.360 --> 02:45:51.360
students and that

02:45:51.360 --> 02:45:53.360
they had a performance

02:45:53.360 --> 02:45:55.360
level in California.

02:45:55.360 --> 02:45:57.360
The first pie is this

02:45:57.360 --> 02:45:59.360
indicator. We are looking for

02:45:59.360 --> 02:46:01.360
blue and green.

02:46:01.360 --> 02:46:03.360
So we see some blue,

02:46:03.360 --> 02:46:05.360
a little bit of blue, and a little bit more

02:46:05.360 --> 02:46:07.360
of green. When you see the

02:46:07.360 --> 02:46:09.360
equation, the equate

02:46:09.360 --> 02:46:11.360
to the next two pies, you see

02:46:11.360 --> 02:46:13.360
the reclassified

02:46:13.360 --> 02:46:15.360
English proficient students take the green

02:46:15.360 --> 02:46:17.360
and the blue. And you don't see that

02:46:17.360 --> 02:46:19.360
with the English learners. So this

02:46:19.360 --> 02:46:21.360
is an aspect of

02:46:21.360 --> 02:46:23.360
us encouraging our districts

02:46:23.360 --> 02:46:25.360
to disaggregate that data, especially

02:46:25.360 --> 02:46:27.360
locally having more

02:46:27.360 --> 02:46:29.360
opportunities to see that data

02:46:29.360 --> 02:46:31.360
more widely.

02:46:31.360 --> 02:46:33.360
And so we feel that a critical

02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:35.360
focus on English learners is not

02:46:35.360 --> 02:46:37.360
only about the performance level, but

02:46:37.360 --> 02:46:39.360
also that progress

02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:41.360
and that celebrating the success of the

02:46:41.360 --> 02:46:43.360
reclassified English

02:46:43.360 --> 02:46:45.360
proficient students is just as

02:46:45.360 --> 02:46:47.360
important as celebrating and

02:46:47.360 --> 02:46:49.360
adequately reflecting the needs of

02:46:49.360 --> 02:46:51.360
our English learner-only

02:46:51.360 --> 02:46:53.360
student group. And

02:46:53.360 --> 02:46:55.360
finally, in this

02:46:55.360 --> 02:46:57.360
last slide that I have,

02:46:57.360 --> 02:46:59.360
is just, you know,

02:46:59.360 --> 02:47:01.360
an example of what

02:47:01.360 --> 02:47:03.360
it looks like at a district

02:47:03.360 --> 02:47:05.360
level, this kind of data.

02:47:05.360 --> 02:47:07.360
As a county, we suggest to our districts

02:47:07.360 --> 02:47:09.360
the importance of disaggregating

02:47:09.360 --> 02:47:11.360
the academic indicator

02:47:11.360 --> 02:47:13.360
for ELA and mathematics.

02:47:13.360 --> 02:47:15.360
Again, this example is a district

02:47:15.360 --> 02:47:17.360
not in Sacramento, like I said, and it

02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:19.360
shows how the data,

02:47:19.360 --> 02:47:21.360
once disaggregated, behaves

02:47:21.360 --> 02:47:23.360
with the purpose to have a better

02:47:23.360 --> 02:47:25.360
picture of the needs of the reclassified

02:47:25.360 --> 02:47:27.360
students as they are being monitored,

02:47:27.360 --> 02:47:29.360
as well as the English learners that

02:47:29.360 --> 02:47:31.360
they are in need of accessing

02:47:31.360 --> 02:47:33.360
content and acquiring the English

02:47:33.360 --> 02:47:35.360
language in the comparison

02:47:35.360 --> 02:47:37.360
of their English-only peers.

02:47:37.360 --> 02:47:39.360
We feel that this practice

02:47:39.360 --> 02:47:41.360
is important for the continuous

02:47:41.360 --> 02:47:43.360
improvement and responsive needs

02:47:43.360 --> 02:47:45.360
plans to be implemented.

02:47:45.360 --> 02:47:47.360
It also provides a

02:47:47.360 --> 02:47:49.360
more accurate picture

02:47:49.360 --> 02:47:51.360
for their educational partners

02:47:51.360 --> 02:47:53.360
and opportunities to affect

02:47:53.360 --> 02:47:55.360
relevant, increased,

02:47:55.360 --> 02:47:57.360
or improved services.

02:47:57.360 --> 02:47:59.360
The California Schools dashboard

02:47:59.360 --> 02:48:01.360
provides the mathematics and

02:48:01.360 --> 02:48:03.360
English language arts data comparisons

02:48:03.360 --> 02:48:05.360
for English learners.

02:48:05.360 --> 02:48:07.360
We encourage

02:48:07.360 --> 02:48:09.360
our districts to reflect

02:48:09.360 --> 02:48:11.360
this in their LCAPs,

02:48:11.360 --> 02:48:13.360
and in the recent years,

02:48:13.360 --> 02:48:15.360
we have seen more of our districts

02:48:15.360 --> 02:48:17.360
include the comparative data

02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:19.360
in their plans.

02:48:19.360 --> 02:48:21.360
And with that, I will now turn it over

02:48:21.360 --> 02:48:23.360
to Dr. Cook to share

02:48:23.360 --> 02:48:25.360
how we plan to move forward

02:48:25.360 --> 02:48:27.360
with the LCAP development.

02:48:27.360 --> 02:48:29.360
Great. Thank you, Graciela.

02:48:29.360 --> 02:48:31.360
So, you know, kind of looking ahead,

02:48:31.360 --> 02:48:33.360
you know, given this moment in time

02:48:33.360 --> 02:48:35.360
as we look forward to a new

02:48:35.360 --> 02:48:37.360
dashboard and as we kind of emerge

02:48:37.360 --> 02:48:39.360
from these last two

02:48:39.360 --> 02:48:41.360
COVID years, so to speak,

02:48:41.360 --> 02:48:43.360
I don't know if we're emerging. I'm

02:48:43.360 --> 02:48:45.360
actually recovering from COVID

02:48:45.360 --> 02:48:47.360
right now, so it's still very much

02:48:47.360 --> 02:48:49.360
here. But we're really

02:48:49.360 --> 02:48:51.360
taking to heart actually

02:48:51.360 --> 02:48:53.360
dashboard principle 10 that was just

02:48:53.360 --> 02:48:55.360
discussed that really promotes

02:48:55.360 --> 02:48:57.360
coherence between data

02:48:57.360 --> 02:48:59.360
reporting and support

02:48:59.360 --> 02:49:01.360
and improvement programs.

02:49:01.360 --> 02:49:03.360
You know, the dashboard,

02:49:03.360 --> 02:49:05.360
the LCAP process, the system

02:49:05.360 --> 02:49:07.360
of support all work together to identify

02:49:07.360 --> 02:49:09.360
and address areas of performance

02:49:09.360 --> 02:49:11.360
that need to improve

02:49:11.360 --> 02:49:13.360
so that all interested parties

02:49:13.360 --> 02:49:15.360
can understand and work towards

02:49:15.360 --> 02:49:17.360
consensus

02:49:17.360 --> 02:49:19.360
on the improvement priorities for

02:49:19.360 --> 02:49:21.360
a district and its schools.

02:49:21.360 --> 02:49:23.360
The review of these indicator

02:49:23.360 --> 02:49:25.360
data is embedded into

02:49:25.360 --> 02:49:27.360
the annual processes that drive goal

02:49:27.360 --> 02:49:29.360
setting, outcome actions, and expenditures

02:49:29.360 --> 02:49:31.360
in every district in California.

02:49:31.360 --> 02:49:33.360
And really what that looks like for us

02:49:33.360 --> 02:49:35.360
in our county is a continued collaboration

02:49:35.360 --> 02:49:37.360
with county office partners

02:49:37.360 --> 02:49:39.360
and advocacy groups to

02:49:39.360 --> 02:49:41.360
enhance our work.

02:49:41.360 --> 02:49:43.360
And within our own county office,

02:49:43.360 --> 02:49:45.360
a continued cross-departmental collaboration

02:49:45.360 --> 02:49:47.360
to deepen our implementation.

02:49:47.360 --> 02:49:49.360
And that really means

02:49:49.360 --> 02:49:51.360
looking at curriculum and instruction,

02:49:51.360 --> 02:49:53.360
LCAP, data and assessment, expanded

02:49:53.360 --> 02:49:55.360
learning, early learning, social-emotional

02:49:55.360 --> 02:49:57.360
learning, the list goes on and on.

02:49:57.360 --> 02:49:59.360
And really kind of making sure that we

02:49:59.360 --> 02:50:01.360
stay organized and connected in such

02:50:01.360 --> 02:50:03.360
a way that our support to districts

02:50:03.360 --> 02:50:05.360
and charter schools in our

02:50:05.360 --> 02:50:07.360
county is coherent, cohesive,

02:50:07.360 --> 02:50:09.360
and useful

02:50:09.360 --> 02:50:11.360
at helping districts

02:50:11.360 --> 02:50:13.360
and systems really get at

02:50:13.360 --> 02:50:15.360
improving outcomes for students. So I

02:50:15.360 --> 02:50:17.360
guess with that, thank you

02:50:17.360 --> 02:50:19.360
for your time today. We hope

02:50:19.360 --> 02:50:21.360
that this presentation has provided

02:50:21.360 --> 02:50:23.360
a little glimpse into how

02:50:23.360 --> 02:50:25.360
we provide guidance and support

02:50:25.360 --> 02:50:27.360
to LEAs in our county.

02:50:27.360 --> 02:50:29.360
And in particular, supporting

02:50:29.360 --> 02:50:31.360
and improving English learner outcomes.

02:50:31.360 --> 02:50:33.360
And that's

02:50:33.360 --> 02:50:35.360
it for us. Is there any

02:50:35.360 --> 02:50:37.360
questions?

02:50:43.360 --> 02:50:45.360
I think we can

02:50:45.360 --> 02:50:47.360
proceed on. I think there's

02:50:47.360 --> 02:50:49.360
maybe still part of the item left

02:50:49.360 --> 02:50:51.360
to present. Thank you

02:50:51.360 --> 02:50:53.360
so much.

02:50:57.360 --> 02:50:59.360
Josh, are you there to

02:50:59.360 --> 02:51:01.360
present the next part of the item?

02:51:07.360 --> 02:51:09.360
Good morning. We still have a couple

02:51:09.360 --> 02:51:11.360
minutes left before morning. I'm going to

02:51:11.360 --> 02:51:13.360
get you through this so you can

02:51:13.360 --> 02:51:15.360
start your deliberations.

02:51:15.360 --> 02:51:17.360
Just to close this out, we

02:51:17.360 --> 02:51:19.360
have been busy this year, and

02:51:19.360 --> 02:51:21.360
I predict very

02:51:21.360 --> 02:51:23.360
soon, by the end of the month, we will hit 10,000

02:51:23.360 --> 02:51:25.360
participants in our presentations

02:51:25.360 --> 02:51:27.360
for the year. We

02:51:27.360 --> 02:51:29.360
spent really the spring

02:51:29.360 --> 02:51:31.360
and summer preparing for

02:51:31.360 --> 02:51:33.360
this fall, and so this gives you just

02:51:33.360 --> 02:51:35.360
a high-level overview

02:51:35.360 --> 02:51:37.360
of how much outreach we've been doing.

02:51:37.360 --> 02:51:39.360
But more importantly, on

02:51:39.360 --> 02:51:41.360
this next slide, we have

02:51:41.360 --> 02:51:43.360
a webinar series that we launched

02:51:43.360 --> 02:51:45.360
this Tuesday. We copied

02:51:45.360 --> 02:51:47.360
really Josh does these Tuesdays

02:51:47.360 --> 02:51:49.360
at 2. We're doing Tuesdays at 2 in

02:51:49.360 --> 02:51:51.360
November. In December, he's going to pick

02:51:51.360 --> 02:51:53.360
up the Tuesdays at 2. We had

02:51:53.360 --> 02:51:55.360
close to 1,000 people on that webinar,

02:51:55.360 --> 02:51:57.360
which talked about

02:51:57.360 --> 02:51:59.360
just introduction to the Dashboard.

02:51:59.360 --> 02:52:01.360
Kimberly Munhink, who's on

02:52:01.360 --> 02:52:03.360
the Zoom today and is supporting

02:52:03.360 --> 02:52:05.360
us from

02:52:05.360 --> 02:52:07.360
Anaheim at the California Education

02:52:07.360 --> 02:52:09.360
Research Conference, her team, along

02:52:09.360 --> 02:52:11.360
with many others, not only in my division,

02:52:11.360 --> 02:52:13.360
but really throughout

02:52:13.360 --> 02:52:15.360
the department who assist us,

02:52:15.360 --> 02:52:17.360
we've really

02:52:17.360 --> 02:52:19.360
benefited from this collaborative effort to

02:52:19.360 --> 02:52:21.360
make sure we are prepared as

02:52:21.360 --> 02:52:23.360
possible to continue to support the field

02:52:23.360 --> 02:52:25.360
once the Dashboard is live

02:52:25.360 --> 02:52:27.360
in December.

02:52:27.360 --> 02:52:29.360
One thing I wanted to mention is

02:52:29.360 --> 02:52:31.360
a presentation Kim did today

02:52:31.360 --> 02:52:33.360
with the Los Angeles County Office of

02:52:33.360 --> 02:52:35.360
Education around

02:52:35.360 --> 02:52:37.360
looking at how to support

02:52:37.360 --> 02:52:39.360
LEAs, look at their results in the

02:52:39.360 --> 02:52:41.360
Dashboard. And I think

02:52:41.360 --> 02:52:43.360
one thing is that we need to keep in mind

02:52:43.360 --> 02:52:45.360
LEAs are talking

02:52:45.360 --> 02:52:47.360
and serving students every single day.

02:52:47.360 --> 02:52:49.360
The state and this Dashboard

02:52:49.360 --> 02:52:51.360
gets produced once a year. And so

02:52:51.360 --> 02:52:53.360
we're really looking in a rear view mirror

02:52:53.360 --> 02:52:55.360
and really the true work

02:52:55.360 --> 02:52:57.360
happens on a daily basis

02:52:57.360 --> 02:52:59.360
with a teacher serving

02:52:59.360 --> 02:53:01.360
students and helping to

02:53:01.360 --> 02:53:03.360
impact their lives and

02:53:03.360 --> 02:53:05.360
their future. And so we are so grateful

02:53:05.360 --> 02:53:07.360
for this

02:53:07.360 --> 02:53:09.360
large system, not only of support,

02:53:09.360 --> 02:53:11.360
but around accountability, around

02:53:11.360 --> 02:53:13.360
data reporting, and

02:53:13.360 --> 02:53:15.360
we are prepared for a release,

02:53:15.360 --> 02:53:17.360
like I mentioned in December.

02:53:17.360 --> 02:53:19.360
One thing I also wanted to just say

02:53:19.360 --> 02:53:21.360
in passing is we have

02:53:21.360 --> 02:53:23.360
because we are in our busy time,

02:53:23.360 --> 02:53:25.360
we've been delayed on some other reports, but one

02:53:25.360 --> 02:53:27.360
piece of data we got out this week was

02:53:27.360 --> 02:53:29.360
updating our college going rate reports.

02:53:29.360 --> 02:53:31.360
So for those of you that really

02:53:31.360 --> 02:53:33.360
are paying attention to high schools,

02:53:33.360 --> 02:53:35.360
this is a report that we've only been able

02:53:35.360 --> 02:53:37.360
to do with some additional

02:53:37.360 --> 02:53:39.360
funding for National Student Clearinghouse

02:53:39.360 --> 02:53:41.360
data. And so that is

02:53:41.360 --> 02:53:43.360
a match set that

02:53:43.360 --> 02:53:45.360
we have not updated in two years. So I'm really excited

02:53:45.360 --> 02:53:47.360
that that data is out there.

02:53:47.360 --> 02:53:49.360
It does not contribute to accountability.

02:53:49.360 --> 02:53:51.360
It does not contribute to assessments, but it simply

02:53:51.360 --> 02:53:53.360
provides a perspective on students

02:53:53.360 --> 02:53:55.360
who are able to

02:53:55.360 --> 02:53:57.360
enroll in our public

02:53:57.360 --> 02:53:59.360
institutions and private

02:53:59.360 --> 02:54:01.360
institutions of higher education in California,

02:54:01.360 --> 02:54:03.360
including our community college system.

02:54:03.360 --> 02:54:05.360
So with that,

02:54:05.360 --> 02:54:07.360
the recommendation is that the CDE

02:54:07.360 --> 02:54:09.360
recommends approval of the California

02:54:09.360 --> 02:54:11.360
School Dashboard principles.

02:54:15.360 --> 02:54:17.360
Terrific. Thank you so much.

02:54:17.360 --> 02:54:19.360
At this point, we do want to put up

02:54:19.360 --> 02:54:21.360
the public comment

02:54:21.360 --> 02:54:23.360
line slide.

02:54:23.360 --> 02:54:25.360
We'll open the phone line for public comment.

02:54:25.360 --> 02:54:27.360
Members of the public wishing to provide

02:54:27.360 --> 02:54:29.360
public comment on this item may do

02:54:29.360 --> 02:54:31.360
so by calling the telephone number and

02:54:31.360 --> 02:54:33.360
using the access code provided on the

02:54:33.360 --> 02:54:35.360
slide that is shown now.

02:54:35.360 --> 02:54:37.360
And while we're waiting, I want to ask our liaison

02:54:37.360 --> 02:54:39.360
Vice President Glover-Woods if she has

02:54:39.360 --> 02:54:41.360
any initial comments before me.

02:54:41.360 --> 02:54:43.360
Then I'll ask board members if they have

02:54:43.360 --> 02:54:45.360
any clarifying questions on

02:54:45.360 --> 02:54:47.360
factual points before we go to public

02:54:47.360 --> 02:54:49.360
comment, which will be followed

02:54:49.360 --> 02:54:51.360
by board discussion.

02:54:51.360 --> 02:54:53.360
And so

02:54:53.360 --> 02:54:55.360
let's see if

02:54:55.360 --> 02:54:57.360
Vice President Glover-Woods

02:54:59.360 --> 02:55:01.360
You are, I'm not hearing you.

02:55:03.360 --> 02:55:05.360
Vice President Glover-Woods is

02:55:05.360 --> 02:55:07.360
not coming through on this end either.

02:55:07.360 --> 02:55:09.360
Yeah, we're not able

02:55:09.360 --> 02:55:11.360
to hear you. There may be something wrong with

02:55:11.360 --> 02:55:13.360
your audio.

02:55:15.360 --> 02:55:17.360
Okay.

02:55:17.360 --> 02:55:19.360
So we'll come back to you.

02:55:19.360 --> 02:55:21.360
Very

02:55:21.360 --> 02:55:23.360
good. Are there any clarifying

02:55:23.360 --> 02:55:25.360
questions on matters of fact

02:55:25.360 --> 02:55:27.360
from the board before

02:55:27.360 --> 02:55:29.360
we go to public comment?

02:55:33.360 --> 02:55:35.360
And I am not

02:55:35.360 --> 02:55:37.360
seeing any at the moment.

02:55:37.360 --> 02:55:39.360
That's a good thing because we stand between

02:55:39.360 --> 02:55:41.360
ourselves and lunch.

02:55:41.360 --> 02:55:43.360
Hopefully everything is crystal

02:55:43.360 --> 02:55:45.360
clear. We will now

02:55:45.360 --> 02:55:47.360
see if there is any public comment.

02:55:47.360 --> 02:55:49.360
We have

02:55:49.360 --> 02:55:51.360
13 callers on the queue. I will open

02:55:51.360 --> 02:55:53.360
up the phone line now.

02:55:53.360 --> 02:55:55.360
Good afternoon. Please state your name and affiliation

02:55:55.360 --> 02:55:57.360
for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts

02:55:57.360 --> 02:55:59.360
now.

02:56:05.360 --> 02:56:07.360
Caller ending in the last four digits,

02:56:07.360 --> 02:56:09.360
4450, you are now live. Please

02:56:09.360 --> 02:56:11.360
start your public comment.

02:56:15.360 --> 02:56:17.360
I'm Lauren Johnson, Mount

02:56:17.360 --> 02:56:19.360
Gavreau Unified School District.

02:56:19.360 --> 02:56:21.360
In Kern County

02:56:21.360 --> 02:56:23.360
with a population of

02:56:23.360 --> 02:56:25.360
36,544

02:56:25.360 --> 02:56:27.360
English learners, no districts

02:56:27.360 --> 02:56:29.360
are required to include a goal

02:56:29.360 --> 02:56:31.360
for ELs in their LCAP.

02:56:31.360 --> 02:56:33.360
Without including a goal

02:56:33.360 --> 02:56:35.360
with accompanying actions and

02:56:35.360 --> 02:56:37.360
services, the equitable

02:56:37.360 --> 02:56:39.360
allocation of funds by these students

02:56:39.360 --> 02:56:41.360
is not consistent with the dashboard

02:56:41.360 --> 02:56:43.360
principle 10 calling for

02:56:43.360 --> 02:56:45.360
coherence between data

02:56:45.360 --> 02:56:47.360
reporting and support and

02:56:47.360 --> 02:56:49.360
improvement programs.

02:56:49.360 --> 02:56:51.360
The ELPI

02:56:51.360 --> 02:56:53.360
suggested English learners

02:56:53.360 --> 02:56:55.360
in only two districts out of

02:56:55.360 --> 02:56:57.360
48 are not making adequate

02:56:57.360 --> 02:56:59.360
progress for learning English

02:56:59.360 --> 02:57:01.360
and only two districts are eligible

02:57:01.360 --> 02:57:03.360
for support through differentiated

02:57:03.360 --> 02:57:05.360
assistance.

02:57:05.360 --> 02:57:07.360
We question whether only holding two

02:57:07.360 --> 02:57:09.360
districts accountable for progress

02:57:09.360 --> 02:57:11.360
and learning English and two for

02:57:11.360 --> 02:57:13.360
additional support through

02:57:13.360 --> 02:57:15.360
DA represents the true needs in a

02:57:15.360 --> 02:57:17.360
community with large numbers of

02:57:17.360 --> 02:57:19.360
English learners.

02:57:19.360 --> 02:57:21.360
We treat each component of the accountability

02:57:21.360 --> 02:57:23.360
system to better represent

02:57:23.360 --> 02:57:25.360
what should be the approach for

02:57:25.360 --> 02:57:27.360
uplifting the needs of ELs.

02:57:27.360 --> 02:57:29.360
Thank you.

02:57:29.360 --> 02:57:31.360
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

02:57:31.360 --> 02:57:33.360
for the record. You have one minute. Your time

02:57:33.360 --> 02:57:35.360
starts now.

02:57:37.360 --> 02:57:39.360
Good afternoon.

02:57:39.360 --> 02:57:41.360
This is Jessica Sacco on behalf

02:57:41.360 --> 02:57:43.360
of Children Now calling in

02:57:43.360 --> 02:57:45.360
to the proposed dashboard

02:57:45.360 --> 02:57:47.360
principle. I'd like to thank

02:57:47.360 --> 02:57:49.360
the department staff for

02:57:49.360 --> 02:57:51.360
opening the doors of conversation

02:57:51.360 --> 02:57:53.360
with the LCFF equity coalition

02:57:53.360 --> 02:57:55.360
and for being so responsive

02:57:55.360 --> 02:57:57.360
to many of our suggestions

02:57:57.360 --> 02:57:59.360
and engaging in deep

02:57:59.360 --> 02:58:01.360
conversation. I'd like to focus

02:58:01.360 --> 02:58:03.360
specifically around encouraging

02:58:03.360 --> 02:58:05.360
around principle

02:58:05.360 --> 02:58:07.360
number one.

02:58:09.360 --> 02:58:11.360
We feel that this

02:58:11.360 --> 02:58:13.360
particular principle does not

02:58:13.360 --> 02:58:15.360
exemplify what we consider to be

02:58:15.360 --> 02:58:17.360
current practice and therefore we

02:58:17.360 --> 02:58:19.360
are in full support of

02:58:19.360 --> 02:58:21.360
this principle as we

02:58:21.360 --> 02:58:23.360
believe and we encourage

02:58:23.360 --> 02:58:25.360
you to add well-rounded to

02:58:25.360 --> 02:58:27.360
that principle. For principle

02:58:27.360 --> 02:58:29.360
number two, our

02:58:29.360 --> 02:58:31.360
concern is that the LCFF, excuse me,

02:58:31.360 --> 02:58:33.360
the equity report simply reports

02:58:33.360 --> 02:58:35.360
a particular student group's place in

02:58:35.360 --> 02:58:37.360
relation to a standard but not in relation

02:58:37.360 --> 02:58:39.360
to other student groups therefore making

02:58:39.360 --> 02:58:41.360
a view of the achievement gap

02:58:41.360 --> 02:58:43.360
a lot more challenging.

02:58:43.360 --> 02:58:45.360
For principles three and four,

02:58:45.360 --> 02:58:47.360
we've included in our letter

02:58:47.360 --> 02:58:49.360
an attachment for details about how the

02:58:49.360 --> 02:58:51.360
current rating system favors some indicators

02:58:51.360 --> 02:58:53.360
over others in identifying

02:58:53.360 --> 02:58:55.360
LEAs for district assistance

02:58:55.360 --> 02:58:57.360
and we strongly support

02:58:57.360 --> 02:58:59.360
and want to

02:58:59.360 --> 02:59:01.360
state that we strongly support a

02:59:01.360 --> 02:59:03.360
multiple measures accountability system.

02:59:03.360 --> 02:59:05.360
We do have

02:59:05.360 --> 02:59:07.360
concerns about the use of the term

02:59:07.360 --> 02:59:09.360
equally.

02:59:09.360 --> 02:59:11.360
Thank you.

02:59:11.360 --> 02:59:13.360
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:59:13.360 --> 02:59:15.360
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

02:59:17.360 --> 02:59:19.360
Hi, Peter

02:59:19.360 --> 02:59:21.360
Ahern, President of the California Association

02:59:21.360 --> 02:59:23.360
of Science Educators, speaking on behalf of

02:59:23.360 --> 02:59:25.360
a large coalition of science educators

02:59:25.360 --> 02:59:27.360
and organizations. We support the

02:59:27.360 --> 02:59:29.360
change to dashboard principle three to

02:59:29.360 --> 02:59:31.360
say it reports each indicator separately

02:59:31.360 --> 02:59:33.360
since this helps resolve concerns

02:59:33.360 --> 02:59:35.360
about how indicators are weighted.

02:59:35.360 --> 02:59:37.360
We wonder if the language

02:59:37.360 --> 02:59:39.360
in the new dashboard indicator number four

02:59:39.360 --> 02:59:41.360
that says values each indicator

02:59:41.360 --> 02:59:43.360
equally could be amended to say

02:59:43.360 --> 02:59:45.360
values each indicator since the word

02:59:45.360 --> 02:59:47.360
equally could bring back the concern about

02:59:47.360 --> 02:59:49.360
weighting unnecessarily.

02:59:49.360 --> 02:59:51.360
The point of the dashboard is that showing many

02:59:51.360 --> 02:59:53.360
indicators gives a fuller picture of a school's

02:59:53.360 --> 02:59:55.360
performance. It's really up to parents

02:59:55.360 --> 02:59:57.360
the community and students to decide which are

02:59:57.360 --> 02:59:59.360
most important to them. The word

02:59:59.360 --> 03:00:01.360
equally doesn't add anything and implies

03:00:01.360 --> 03:00:03.360
weighting. We hope these changes

03:00:03.360 --> 03:00:05.360
will help resolve some technical issues around

03:00:05.360 --> 03:00:07.360
science being added to the dashboard.

03:00:07.360 --> 03:00:09.360
We look forward to science being on the dashboard

03:00:09.360 --> 03:00:11.360
next year once we have two years of

03:00:11.360 --> 03:00:13.360
valid and reliable data.

03:00:13.360 --> 03:00:15.360
Thank you. Thank you.

03:00:15.360 --> 03:00:17.360
Next caller, please state your name and

03:00:17.360 --> 03:00:19.360
affiliation for the record. You have one minute.

03:00:19.360 --> 03:00:21.360
Your time starts now.

03:00:27.360 --> 03:00:29.360
Hi, this is Manuel

03:00:29.360 --> 03:00:31.360
Blancosta, Associate Director of Policy at California

03:00:31.360 --> 03:00:33.360
and I'm calling to raise

03:00:33.360 --> 03:00:35.360
our ongoing concern about our current

03:00:35.360 --> 03:00:37.360
accountability system, hiding

03:00:37.360 --> 03:00:39.360
outcomes for English learners.

03:00:39.360 --> 03:00:41.360
This is especially apparent when we look at our

03:00:41.360 --> 03:00:43.360
secondary students.

03:00:43.360 --> 03:00:45.360
This is of critical importance given that

03:00:45.360 --> 03:00:47.360
nearly half of secondary English learners

03:00:47.360 --> 03:00:49.360
are long-term English learners.

03:00:49.360 --> 03:00:51.360
This means that half of our secondary

03:00:51.360 --> 03:00:53.360
ELs are in a system that has failed

03:00:53.360 --> 03:00:55.360
to meet them along their journey

03:00:55.360 --> 03:00:57.360
towards English language proficiency.

03:00:57.360 --> 03:00:59.360
We are encouraged

03:00:59.360 --> 03:01:01.360
to hear the September State Board of Education

03:01:01.360 --> 03:01:03.360
meeting and Dr. Hammond

03:01:03.360 --> 03:01:05.360
referenced a possible need to see how

03:01:05.360 --> 03:01:07.360
long-term English learners might be

03:01:07.360 --> 03:01:09.360
addressed within the state accountability system.

03:01:09.360 --> 03:01:11.360
And we fully support the State Board of

03:01:11.360 --> 03:01:13.360
Education looking for the answers.

03:01:13.360 --> 03:01:15.360
In particular,

03:01:15.360 --> 03:01:17.360
measuring and setting goals for districts

03:01:17.360 --> 03:01:19.360
to reduce the proportion of their secondary

03:01:19.360 --> 03:01:21.360
English learners who are long-term

03:01:21.360 --> 03:01:23.360
English learners might be a possible

03:01:23.360 --> 03:01:25.360
case to look at, very similar to the goals

03:01:25.360 --> 03:01:27.360
that we set for

03:01:27.360 --> 03:01:29.360
expulsion rates

03:01:29.360 --> 03:01:31.360
and other similar measures.

03:01:31.360 --> 03:01:33.360
Thank you again for looking into

03:01:33.360 --> 03:01:35.360
accountability for English learners

03:01:35.360 --> 03:01:37.360
and especially making sure that we're

03:01:37.360 --> 03:01:39.360
addressing the specific needs of

03:01:39.360 --> 03:01:41.360
the different types of English learners

03:01:41.360 --> 03:01:43.360
that are in our system, in particular

03:01:43.360 --> 03:01:45.360
our long-term English learners. Thank you.

03:01:45.360 --> 03:01:47.360
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name

03:01:47.360 --> 03:01:49.360
and affiliation for the record. You have one minute.

03:01:49.360 --> 03:01:51.360
Your time starts now.

03:01:53.360 --> 03:01:55.360
Hi.

03:01:55.360 --> 03:01:57.360
My name is Martha Martinez

03:01:57.360 --> 03:01:59.360
and I am from SEALS, the broader early

03:01:59.360 --> 03:02:01.360
academic language, and I want to thank

03:02:01.360 --> 03:02:03.360
the State Board of Education members

03:02:03.360 --> 03:02:05.360
for your attempts to create an accountability

03:02:05.360 --> 03:02:07.360
system that promotes a more equitable

03:02:07.360 --> 03:02:09.360
education system.

03:02:09.360 --> 03:02:11.360
Unfortunately, the current dashboard and

03:02:11.360 --> 03:02:13.360
accountability measures are not consistent

03:02:13.360 --> 03:02:15.360
with the principles we are adopting today,

03:02:15.360 --> 03:02:17.360
in particular principle 2.

03:02:17.360 --> 03:02:19.360
The current system obscures the performance

03:02:19.360 --> 03:02:21.360
and needs of English learners

03:02:21.360 --> 03:02:23.360
and sets performance standards for

03:02:23.360 --> 03:02:25.360
English learners that are too low.

03:02:25.360 --> 03:02:27.360
Over half of the state's current

03:02:27.360 --> 03:02:29.360
ELs are either long-term

03:02:29.360 --> 03:02:31.360
English learners or they are at risk

03:02:31.360 --> 03:02:33.360
of becoming an ELTEL.

03:02:33.360 --> 03:02:35.360
However, the state's current proposal would only

03:02:35.360 --> 03:02:37.360
require two districts to include a goal

03:02:37.360 --> 03:02:39.360
for English learners in their LCAP

03:02:39.360 --> 03:02:41.360
and would identify less than 1%

03:02:41.360 --> 03:02:43.360
of English learners as not

03:02:43.360 --> 03:02:45.360
making sufficient progress in learning English.

03:02:45.360 --> 03:02:47.360
I strongly encourage you

03:02:47.360 --> 03:02:49.360
to consider the unintended

03:02:49.360 --> 03:02:51.360
consequences from the current accountability

03:02:51.360 --> 03:02:53.360
approach and to develop an alternative

03:02:53.360 --> 03:02:55.360
approach, including convening

03:02:55.360 --> 03:02:57.360
a workgroup to help you identify

03:02:57.360 --> 03:02:59.360
accountability metrics that will promote

03:02:59.360 --> 03:03:01.360
equity for all students, including

03:03:01.360 --> 03:03:03.360
English learners. Thank you.

03:03:03.360 --> 03:03:05.360
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name

03:03:05.360 --> 03:03:07.360
and affiliation for the record. You have one minute.

03:03:07.360 --> 03:03:09.360
Your time starts now.

03:03:11.360 --> 03:03:13.360
Greetings, Madam President

03:03:13.360 --> 03:03:15.360
and State Board members. My name is

03:03:15.360 --> 03:03:17.360
Vanessa Calderon, Assistant Principal

03:03:17.360 --> 03:03:19.360
at Chano Inns High School in Oxnard, California.

03:03:19.360 --> 03:03:21.360
There are 16,043

03:03:21.360 --> 03:03:23.360
English learners enrolling

03:03:23.360 --> 03:03:25.360
schools in the Ontario Valley.

03:03:25.360 --> 03:03:27.360
They constitute 43 of all students

03:03:27.360 --> 03:03:29.360
in this county. No school

03:03:29.360 --> 03:03:31.360
is identified for SEI

03:03:31.360 --> 03:03:33.360
or ATSI. No

03:03:33.360 --> 03:03:35.360
district has to include a goal for

03:03:35.360 --> 03:03:37.360
their English learners in their LCAP

03:03:37.360 --> 03:03:39.360
and only one district was identified for

03:03:39.360 --> 03:03:41.360
extra support to differentiated assistance.

03:03:41.360 --> 03:03:43.360
One would assume that the

03:03:43.360 --> 03:03:45.360
English learners are doing well, but the

03:03:45.360 --> 03:03:47.360
CAS data that was just presented does

03:03:47.360 --> 03:03:49.360
not indicate that. So how do

03:03:49.360 --> 03:03:51.360
these decisions based upon the data

03:03:51.360 --> 03:03:53.360
from the dashboard align with principles

03:03:53.360 --> 03:03:55.360
two, five, and six?

03:03:55.360 --> 03:03:57.360
The low expectation of the CAS score

03:03:57.360 --> 03:03:59.360
for ELPI did not identify one

03:03:59.360 --> 03:04:01.360
district, the very low in performance

03:04:01.360 --> 03:04:03.360
level. We should be considered looking

03:04:03.360 --> 03:04:05.360
at the alignment of the results

03:04:05.360 --> 03:04:07.360
seen from the data on the

03:04:07.360 --> 03:04:09.360
dashboard and the needs of English learners.

03:04:09.360 --> 03:04:11.360
And what can the systems

03:04:11.360 --> 03:04:13.360
do to make the needs

03:04:13.360 --> 03:04:15.360
of English learners visible and

03:04:15.360 --> 03:04:17.360
optionable? We need your support and

03:04:17.360 --> 03:04:19.360
guidance to make these critical adjustments.

03:04:19.360 --> 03:04:21.360
Thank you. Thank you.

03:04:21.360 --> 03:04:23.360
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

03:04:23.360 --> 03:04:25.360
for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts

03:04:25.360 --> 03:04:27.360
now.

03:04:29.360 --> 03:04:31.360
My name is Jenny Snyder calling on

03:04:31.360 --> 03:04:33.360
behalf of the California County Superintendents

03:04:33.360 --> 03:04:35.360
to support the CDE's

03:04:35.360 --> 03:04:37.360
proposed changes to the dashboard

03:04:37.360 --> 03:04:39.360
principles. We express our deep

03:04:39.360 --> 03:04:41.360
gratitude to Cindy

03:04:41.360 --> 03:04:43.360
Kazanis and her team for providing

03:04:43.360 --> 03:04:45.360
ample opportunities for all educational

03:04:45.360 --> 03:04:47.360
partners to weigh in and

03:04:47.360 --> 03:04:49.360
incorporating our input.

03:04:49.360 --> 03:04:51.360
We would also like to thank

03:04:51.360 --> 03:04:53.360
the Local Agency Systems Support

03:04:53.360 --> 03:04:55.360
Office and the Sacramento County Office

03:04:55.360 --> 03:04:57.360
of Education for such comprehensive

03:04:57.360 --> 03:04:59.360
presentations on the current

03:04:59.360 --> 03:05:01.360
requirements in place to support

03:05:01.360 --> 03:05:03.360
California's English learners through the

03:05:03.360 --> 03:05:05.360
LCAP process.

03:05:05.360 --> 03:05:07.360
The work of improving outcomes for our English

03:05:07.360 --> 03:05:09.360
learners is a shared responsibility.

03:05:09.360 --> 03:05:11.360
The California County Superintendents

03:05:11.360 --> 03:05:13.360
have found great value in the professional

03:05:13.360 --> 03:05:15.360
learning and technical assistance provided

03:05:15.360 --> 03:05:17.360
through the System of Support Educator

03:05:17.360 --> 03:05:19.360
Workforce Investment grant

03:05:19.360 --> 03:05:21.360
provided by our colleagues

03:05:21.360 --> 03:05:23.360
Calhoug and Covey.

03:05:23.360 --> 03:05:25.360
With their support,

03:05:25.360 --> 03:05:27.360
county offices support their local districts

03:05:27.360 --> 03:05:29.360
to utilize the LCAP process

03:05:29.360 --> 03:05:31.360
to operationalize equity

03:05:31.360 --> 03:05:33.360
and improve systems to better support

03:05:33.360 --> 03:05:35.360
our English learners.

03:05:35.360 --> 03:05:37.360
Finally, if the state were to consider

03:05:37.360 --> 03:05:39.360
making any changes to the LCAP,

03:05:39.360 --> 03:05:41.360
we respectfully request that

03:05:41.360 --> 03:05:43.360
no changes are implemented outside

03:05:43.360 --> 03:05:45.360
of the first year of the new

03:05:45.360 --> 03:05:47.360
three-year cycle. Thank you.

03:05:47.360 --> 03:05:49.360
Thank you.

03:05:49.360 --> 03:05:51.360
Mox Collar, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:05:51.360 --> 03:05:53.360
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

03:05:57.360 --> 03:05:59.360
Hello. Patty Chavez with

03:05:59.360 --> 03:06:01.360
SEAL and joining Calhoug Partners today.

03:06:01.360 --> 03:06:03.360
We appreciate the set of data

03:06:03.360 --> 03:06:05.360
dashboard principles and specifically

03:06:05.360 --> 03:06:07.360
the intention of coding gaps across

03:06:07.360 --> 03:06:09.360
the indicators. We believe it's appropriate

03:06:09.360 --> 03:06:11.360
to revisit the results

03:06:11.360 --> 03:06:13.360
and implications of the indicators

03:06:13.360 --> 03:06:15.360
and their alignment to the dashboard principles.

03:06:15.360 --> 03:06:17.360
Many lessons can be drawn from

03:06:17.360 --> 03:06:19.360
the data that today's speakers have

03:06:19.360 --> 03:06:21.360
and will share. We are glad

03:06:21.360 --> 03:06:23.360
to be learning from past initiatives where

03:06:23.360 --> 03:06:25.360
there has been unintended yet

03:06:25.360 --> 03:06:27.360
detrimental consequences for EL.

03:06:27.360 --> 03:06:29.360
The current accountability

03:06:29.360 --> 03:06:31.360
system addressed many of the problems with

03:06:31.360 --> 03:06:33.360
the use of multiple measures. The

03:06:33.360 --> 03:06:35.360
move away from hitting targets to status

03:06:35.360 --> 03:06:37.360
and change, however, is overcorrected

03:06:37.360 --> 03:06:39.360
and now very few districts are

03:06:39.360 --> 03:06:41.360
identified to receive differentiated

03:06:41.360 --> 03:06:43.360
assistance. We

03:06:43.360 --> 03:06:45.360
urge the board to make this time to revisit

03:06:45.360 --> 03:06:47.360
how the academic indicator

03:06:47.360 --> 03:06:49.360
LP, DEA, TSI,

03:06:49.360 --> 03:06:51.360
and ASSI are structured

03:06:51.360 --> 03:06:53.360
and how they can be revised

03:06:53.360 --> 03:06:55.360
to address the needs of EL.

03:06:55.360 --> 03:06:57.360
We welcome an opportunity for us to engage

03:06:57.360 --> 03:06:59.360
to work together to partner with you and

03:06:59.360 --> 03:07:01.360
staff. We thank you very much for your

03:07:01.360 --> 03:07:03.360
dedication. Thank you.

03:07:03.360 --> 03:07:05.360
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

03:07:05.360 --> 03:07:07.360
for the record. You have one minute. Your time

03:07:07.360 --> 03:07:09.360
starts now.

03:07:11.360 --> 03:07:13.360
Good morning, board members.

03:07:13.360 --> 03:07:15.360
My name is Dr. Jose Hugo Moreno, Director of

03:07:15.360 --> 03:07:17.360
Parental Relations for Calvary California Association

03:07:17.360 --> 03:07:19.360
of Bilingual Education, school

03:07:19.360 --> 03:07:21.360
administrator and university professor. Sharing with

03:07:21.360 --> 03:07:23.360
you that in Alameda County, only one

03:07:23.360 --> 03:07:25.360
school district out of 18 has

03:07:25.360 --> 03:07:27.360
to include a goal for English learners

03:07:27.360 --> 03:07:29.360
in the LCAP. Keep in mind

03:07:29.360 --> 03:07:31.360
that the county enrolls 43,000

03:07:31.360 --> 03:07:33.360
English learners in only one district, which is

03:07:33.360 --> 03:07:35.360
5% of the districts need to address the growth

03:07:35.360 --> 03:07:37.360
of English language proficiency for these students,

03:07:37.360 --> 03:07:39.360
our students. The accountability

03:07:39.360 --> 03:07:41.360
system only identifies two districts, or

03:07:41.360 --> 03:07:43.360
10% out of 18, that are eligible

03:07:43.360 --> 03:07:45.360
for additional support.

03:07:45.360 --> 03:07:47.360
To differentiate assistance, the issue of

03:07:47.360 --> 03:07:49.360
transparency addressed in principle six speaks to

03:07:49.360 --> 03:07:51.360
the need to shine a light on language and

03:07:51.360 --> 03:07:53.360
academic needs of English learners.

03:07:53.360 --> 03:07:55.360
I think we all agree that with the numbers

03:07:55.360 --> 03:07:57.360
of English learners in Alameda County, we need

03:07:57.360 --> 03:07:59.360
to evaluate the transparency of the accountability

03:07:59.360 --> 03:08:01.360
system, and the criteria for requiring both actions

03:08:01.360 --> 03:08:03.360
and services for English learners.

03:08:03.360 --> 03:08:05.360
With only one district required to include

03:08:05.360 --> 03:08:07.360
a goal for English learners,

03:08:07.360 --> 03:08:09.360
the visibility of thousands of English learners

03:08:09.360 --> 03:08:11.360
is met. These are our students,

03:08:11.360 --> 03:08:13.360
our future citizens of the state

03:08:13.360 --> 03:08:15.360
and the nation. Thank you.

03:08:15.360 --> 03:08:17.360
Thank you. Next caller,

03:08:17.360 --> 03:08:19.360
please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:08:19.360 --> 03:08:21.360
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

03:08:23.360 --> 03:08:25.360
Hello,

03:08:25.360 --> 03:08:27.360
I'm Sally Fox, representing

03:08:27.360 --> 03:08:29.360
the California Association for Bilingual Education.

03:08:29.360 --> 03:08:31.360
I'm also a retiree from

03:08:31.360 --> 03:08:33.360
the San Diego County Office of Education,

03:08:33.360 --> 03:08:35.360
where an EL data dashboard was

03:08:35.360 --> 03:08:37.360
developed to support leaders of our

03:08:37.360 --> 03:08:39.360
42 county school districts make

03:08:39.360 --> 03:08:41.360
better decisions. The

03:08:41.360 --> 03:08:43.360
SCCLE dashboard makes more specified

03:08:43.360 --> 03:08:45.360
or specific data

03:08:45.360 --> 03:08:47.360
visible for districts, thereby providing

03:08:47.360 --> 03:08:49.360
more meaningful information to truly

03:08:49.360 --> 03:08:51.360
reveal EL needs.

03:08:51.360 --> 03:08:53.360
The latest iteration of SCCLE's tool

03:08:53.360 --> 03:08:55.360
reveals student learning trajectories

03:08:55.360 --> 03:08:57.360
related to English language acquisition

03:08:57.360 --> 03:08:59.360
and allows educators to drill

03:08:59.360 --> 03:09:01.360
through reporting to individual student

03:09:01.360 --> 03:09:03.360
level profiles. This humanizes

03:09:03.360 --> 03:09:05.360
the data so educators may better

03:09:05.360 --> 03:09:07.360
understand the strengths and needs

03:09:07.360 --> 03:09:09.360
of their students. Our current state

03:09:09.360 --> 03:09:11.360
dashboard indicators are not complete

03:09:11.360 --> 03:09:13.360
enough to require any districts in

03:09:13.360 --> 03:09:15.360
San Diego County and only two

03:09:15.360 --> 03:09:17.360
statewide to include a goal for

03:09:17.360 --> 03:09:19.360
ELs and ELPAC, which questions

03:09:19.360 --> 03:09:21.360
the alignment of the dashboard for

03:09:21.360 --> 03:09:23.360
school districts. When considering the process of

03:09:23.360 --> 03:09:25.360
continuous improvement for the state

03:09:25.360 --> 03:09:27.360
dashboard, SCCLE dashboard

03:09:27.360 --> 03:09:29.360
may be a good model to consider.

03:09:29.360 --> 03:09:31.360
Thank you. Thank you.

03:09:31.360 --> 03:09:33.360
Next caller, please state your name and

03:09:33.360 --> 03:09:35.360
affiliation for the record. You have one minute, your

03:09:35.360 --> 03:09:37.360
time starts now.

03:09:39.360 --> 03:09:41.360
Yes, President Darling

03:09:41.360 --> 03:09:43.360
Hannon and members, Shelly Siegel

03:09:43.360 --> 03:09:45.360
Coleman from Californians Together.

03:09:45.360 --> 03:09:47.360
For the 2021-24

03:09:47.360 --> 03:09:49.360
ELPAC, only two districts

03:09:49.360 --> 03:09:51.360
are required to include a goal for English

03:09:51.360 --> 03:09:53.360
learners. Dr. Hakuta explained

03:09:53.360 --> 03:09:55.360
that the EL aggregate score

03:09:55.360 --> 03:09:57.360
gives the best representation of a district

03:09:57.360 --> 03:09:59.360
EL program from initial

03:09:59.360 --> 03:10:01.360
English learners to

03:10:01.360 --> 03:10:03.360
reclassification. We disagree.

03:10:03.360 --> 03:10:05.360
For example, one

03:10:05.360 --> 03:10:07.360
large urban school district with a large

03:10:07.360 --> 03:10:09.360
EL population, not

03:10:09.360 --> 03:10:11.360
a port of entry district, has an

03:10:11.360 --> 03:10:13.360
ELA EL performance level of

03:10:13.360 --> 03:10:15.360
yellow, suggesting they're doing okay.

03:10:15.360 --> 03:10:17.360
But their current ELs

03:10:17.360 --> 03:10:19.360
are red. 60% of

03:10:19.360 --> 03:10:21.360
other districts across the state are

03:10:21.360 --> 03:10:23.360
orange and yellow, indicating room for

03:10:23.360 --> 03:10:25.360
improvement. Their RFPs

03:10:25.360 --> 03:10:27.360
are yellow. 58%

03:10:27.360 --> 03:10:29.360
of other districts are green or blue.

03:10:29.360 --> 03:10:31.360
Again, room for improvement.

03:10:31.360 --> 03:10:33.360
The dashboard suggests there's no

03:10:33.360 --> 03:10:35.360
need to address either of these groups

03:10:35.360 --> 03:10:37.360
in their ELCAS. With Principle 11

03:10:37.360 --> 03:10:39.360
calling out dashboard continuous

03:10:39.360 --> 03:10:41.360
revision and improvement, we are

03:10:41.360 --> 03:10:43.360
eager to collaborate with you

03:10:43.360 --> 03:10:45.360
on this work. Thank you.

03:10:45.360 --> 03:10:47.360
Thank you. Next caller, please state your

03:10:47.360 --> 03:10:49.360
name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute.

03:10:49.360 --> 03:10:51.360
Your time starts now.

03:10:53.360 --> 03:10:55.360
Good afternoon, board

03:10:55.360 --> 03:10:57.360
members. John Effelt from Public

03:10:57.360 --> 03:10:59.360
Advocate. Along with

03:10:59.360 --> 03:11:01.360
the Equity Coalition, we urge the board

03:11:01.360 --> 03:11:03.360
to better identify for support

03:11:03.360 --> 03:11:05.360
and assistance all the LEAs

03:11:05.360 --> 03:11:07.360
that are not making adequate

03:11:07.360 --> 03:11:09.360
progress with your ELs

03:11:09.360 --> 03:11:11.360
in at least two ways. First,

03:11:11.360 --> 03:11:13.360
refine the trigger for determining

03:11:13.360 --> 03:11:15.360
which LEAs should be in

03:11:15.360 --> 03:11:17.360
differentiated systems based on

03:11:17.360 --> 03:11:19.360
their EL performance. Ideas

03:11:19.360 --> 03:11:21.360
worth studying include

03:11:21.360 --> 03:11:23.360
building an individual student growth

03:11:23.360 --> 03:11:25.360
data when those scores become available,

03:11:25.360 --> 03:11:27.360
reducing the number

03:11:27.360 --> 03:11:29.360
of years of RFPs in the measure,

03:11:29.360 --> 03:11:31.360
separating the LP out

03:11:31.360 --> 03:11:33.360
as its own state indicator,

03:11:33.360 --> 03:11:35.360
and or adding an

03:11:35.360 --> 03:11:37.360
LTAL component to the model.

03:11:37.360 --> 03:11:39.360
This work should be part of the dashboard

03:11:39.360 --> 03:11:41.360
work plan for 2023.

03:11:41.360 --> 03:11:43.360
Second, modify

03:11:43.360 --> 03:11:45.360
the LCAP so that more LEAs

03:11:45.360 --> 03:11:47.360
are required to establish separate

03:11:47.360 --> 03:11:49.360
goals, actions, and metrics for

03:11:49.360 --> 03:11:51.360
low-performance student subgroups

03:11:51.360 --> 03:11:53.360
and not just those in differentiated

03:11:53.360 --> 03:11:55.360
systems. Thank you.

03:11:55.360 --> 03:11:57.360
Thank you. Next caller, please

03:11:57.360 --> 03:11:59.360
state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one

03:11:59.360 --> 03:12:01.360
minute. Your time starts now.

03:12:05.360 --> 03:12:07.360
Hello. This is Linda

03:12:07.360 --> 03:12:09.360
Kaminsky. I'm the director of research and policy

03:12:09.360 --> 03:12:11.360
at the Center for Equity for English Learners

03:12:11.360 --> 03:12:13.360
at Loyola Marymount University.

03:12:13.360 --> 03:12:15.360
To achieve equity,

03:12:15.360 --> 03:12:17.360
we must focus on closing opportunity

03:12:17.360 --> 03:12:19.360
and achievement gaps.

03:12:19.360 --> 03:12:21.360
Yet our most recent LCAP report

03:12:21.360 --> 03:12:23.360
by the Center for Equity for English Learners

03:12:23.360 --> 03:12:25.360
looked at 26 districts serving

03:12:25.360 --> 03:12:27.360
1,000 or more

03:12:27.360 --> 03:12:29.360
English learners, which was 50 percent or

03:12:29.360 --> 03:12:31.360
more, and found that out of all

03:12:31.360 --> 03:12:33.360
those 26, only five

03:12:33.360 --> 03:12:35.360
had metrics or desired outcomes

03:12:35.360 --> 03:12:37.360
for English learners. Yet these

03:12:37.360 --> 03:12:39.360
outcomes were not differentiated for

03:12:39.360 --> 03:12:41.360
ELs. For example,

03:12:41.360 --> 03:12:43.360
one area that was concerned

03:12:43.360 --> 03:12:45.360
was high school blackout rates, with

03:12:45.360 --> 03:12:47.360
a goal of decreasing that by 3 percent,

03:12:47.360 --> 03:12:49.360
but 3 percent for both

03:12:49.360 --> 03:12:51.360
all students and for ELs,

03:12:51.360 --> 03:12:53.360
but essentially that doesn't

03:12:53.360 --> 03:12:55.360
close the gap because the ELs

03:12:55.360 --> 03:12:57.360
had double the rate of the dropouts.

03:12:57.360 --> 03:12:59.360
Equity requires

03:12:59.360 --> 03:13:01.360
closing gaps. Closing

03:13:01.360 --> 03:13:03.360
gaps requires an accountability

03:13:03.360 --> 03:13:05.360
system that is based on

03:13:05.360 --> 03:13:07.360
differentiated targets as well as

03:13:07.360 --> 03:13:09.360
the action, services, and support needed

03:13:09.360 --> 03:13:11.360
to achieve these differentiated targets.

03:13:11.360 --> 03:13:13.360
Thank you.

03:13:13.360 --> 03:13:15.360
Thank you. Next caller, please state

03:13:15.360 --> 03:13:17.360
your name and affiliation for the record. You have one

03:13:17.360 --> 03:13:19.360
minute. Your time starts now.

03:13:21.360 --> 03:13:23.360
Good afternoon.

03:13:23.360 --> 03:13:25.360
President Darlingham

03:13:25.360 --> 03:13:27.360
and members, Liz Guiano, public

03:13:27.360 --> 03:13:29.360
advocate, also for the Equity Coalition.

03:13:29.360 --> 03:13:31.360
We appreciate the revisions

03:13:31.360 --> 03:13:33.360
to the guiding principles, but don't

03:13:33.360 --> 03:13:35.360
agree that the current practice and the dashboard

03:13:35.360 --> 03:13:37.360
actually reflects the new language.

03:13:37.360 --> 03:13:39.360
We recommend that aligning

03:13:39.360 --> 03:13:41.360
this assignment be added to the

03:13:41.360 --> 03:13:43.360
department's work time for 23.

03:13:43.360 --> 03:13:45.360
The EL and LCAT

03:13:45.360 --> 03:13:47.360
presentations today were really strong,

03:13:47.360 --> 03:13:49.360
the ones that Josh and

03:13:49.360 --> 03:13:51.360
the Scully team gave. We recommend

03:13:51.360 --> 03:13:53.360
that these presentations be a separate

03:13:53.360 --> 03:13:55.360
webinar to the benefit of LEAs, including

03:13:55.360 --> 03:13:57.360
other county offices of Ed.

03:13:57.360 --> 03:13:59.360
This was a much deeper dive that

03:13:59.360 --> 03:14:01.360
LEAs obviously need.

03:14:01.360 --> 03:14:03.360
Gap closing goals and metrics should be required

03:14:03.360 --> 03:14:05.360
for student groups that are performing substantially

03:14:05.360 --> 03:14:07.360
below white, non-low-income,

03:14:07.360 --> 03:14:09.360
English-only student groups.

03:14:09.360 --> 03:14:11.360
The board and administration should

03:14:11.360 --> 03:14:13.360
consider strengthening this

03:14:13.360 --> 03:14:15.360
demonstration in the LCAP in the January

03:14:15.360 --> 03:14:17.360
budget. Thank you.

03:14:17.360 --> 03:14:19.360
Thank you. Next caller, please state

03:14:19.360 --> 03:14:21.360
your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute.

03:14:21.360 --> 03:14:23.360
Your time starts now.

03:14:25.360 --> 03:14:27.360
Good afternoon. This is Sarah

03:14:27.360 --> 03:14:29.360
Lillis with Peach Plus. I also

03:14:29.360 --> 03:14:31.360
want to share my appreciation for the board

03:14:31.360 --> 03:14:33.360
and staff and hearing and being so responsive

03:14:33.360 --> 03:14:35.360
to our feedback on the dashboard

03:14:35.360 --> 03:14:37.360
principle. We're really thrilled

03:14:37.360 --> 03:14:39.360
with the changes that were made, particularly

03:14:39.360 --> 03:14:41.360
as it relates to principle two, and we

03:14:41.360 --> 03:14:43.360
look forward to the evolution

03:14:43.360 --> 03:14:45.360
of the dashboard to better reflect the

03:14:45.360 --> 03:14:47.360
focus on gaps and gap closure as

03:14:47.360 --> 03:14:49.360
discussed by my colleagues and children now

03:14:49.360 --> 03:14:51.360
and the focus on gaps on the equity

03:14:51.360 --> 03:14:53.360
report. We also want to reiterate

03:14:53.360 --> 03:14:55.360
the

03:14:55.360 --> 03:14:57.360
new principle four. We appreciate that

03:14:57.360 --> 03:14:59.360
we need to articulate valuing

03:14:59.360 --> 03:15:01.360
all of the indicators. We would

03:15:01.360 --> 03:15:03.360
also recommend removing the word

03:15:03.360 --> 03:15:05.360
equally because of the potential

03:15:05.360 --> 03:15:07.360
unintended consequences in terms of

03:15:07.360 --> 03:15:09.360
weighting as we think about equal

03:15:09.360 --> 03:15:11.360
value. Thank you again for all your

03:15:11.360 --> 03:15:13.360
work on this. Thank you.

03:15:13.360 --> 03:15:15.360
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

03:15:15.360 --> 03:15:17.360
for the record. You have one minute. Your time

03:15:17.360 --> 03:15:19.360
starts now.

03:15:21.360 --> 03:15:23.360
Good afternoon. My name is Lucero Chavez,

03:15:23.360 --> 03:15:25.360
Director of Policy and Partnerships

03:15:25.360 --> 03:15:27.360
who is speaking at the Parent Institute for

03:15:27.360 --> 03:15:29.360
Quality Education. Today we urge you to

03:15:29.360 --> 03:15:31.360
take a closer look at how the data

03:15:31.360 --> 03:15:33.360
dashboard principles are translated when

03:15:33.360 --> 03:15:35.360
addressing the needs of English learners.

03:15:35.360 --> 03:15:37.360
We're grateful for the data dashboard

03:15:37.360 --> 03:15:39.360
principles for upholding high

03:15:39.360 --> 03:15:41.360
performance standards and accuracy

03:15:41.360 --> 03:15:43.360
reporting. However, statistics

03:15:43.360 --> 03:15:45.360
aren't required to include the goals

03:15:45.360 --> 03:15:47.360
for EL students in the LCAP. We're

03:15:47.360 --> 03:15:49.360
missing out on important data that could inform

03:15:49.360 --> 03:15:51.360
much needed intervention for students,

03:15:51.360 --> 03:15:53.360
especially after the learning loss

03:15:53.360 --> 03:15:55.360
occurred during the pandemic.

03:15:55.360 --> 03:15:57.360
Parents, including BGIP parents of

03:15:57.360 --> 03:15:59.360
English learners, are eager to engage with

03:15:59.360 --> 03:16:01.360
their schools to support their students' academic

03:16:01.360 --> 03:16:03.360
achievements. The families need data

03:16:03.360 --> 03:16:05.360
on their students' growth and clear,

03:16:05.360 --> 03:16:07.360
ambitious goals that our English learners can work

03:16:07.360 --> 03:16:09.360
towards. Thank you, and we look

03:16:09.360 --> 03:16:11.360
forward to working together for the success of EL

03:16:11.360 --> 03:16:13.360
and the California family.

03:16:13.360 --> 03:16:15.360
Thank you. Next caller,

03:16:15.360 --> 03:16:17.360
please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have

03:16:17.360 --> 03:16:19.360
one minute. Your time starts now.

03:16:19.360 --> 03:16:21.360
Yes, Sandy Mendoza,

03:16:21.360 --> 03:16:23.360
Families and Schools.

03:16:23.360 --> 03:16:25.360
Los Angeles County involves

03:16:25.360 --> 03:16:27.360
247,699

03:16:27.360 --> 03:16:29.360
English learners.

03:16:29.360 --> 03:16:31.360
Narrative from the data

03:16:31.360 --> 03:16:33.360
chart,

03:16:33.360 --> 03:16:35.360
that's what that shows.

03:16:35.360 --> 03:16:37.360
How is it possible that there are

03:16:37.360 --> 03:16:39.360
no districts that are required to have a

03:16:39.360 --> 03:16:41.360
goal in the LCAP for English learners

03:16:41.360 --> 03:16:43.360
and that every EL student in the

03:16:43.360 --> 03:16:45.360
80 districts in the county are

03:16:45.360 --> 03:16:47.360
making adequate decisions?

03:16:47.360 --> 03:16:49.360
In the county are making adequate

03:16:49.360 --> 03:16:51.360
progress in learning English.

03:16:51.360 --> 03:16:53.360
Differentiated assistance should

03:16:53.360 --> 03:16:55.360
be supporting the closing of gaps for

03:16:55.360 --> 03:16:57.360
student subgroups of state and

03:16:57.360 --> 03:16:59.360
principal too, but our current

03:16:59.360 --> 03:17:01.360
system of support only identifies

03:17:01.360 --> 03:17:03.360
three out of 80 districts needing

03:17:03.360 --> 03:17:05.360
support for their English learners.

03:17:05.360 --> 03:17:07.360
This is not an accurate picture

03:17:07.360 --> 03:17:09.360
of what is needed across districts in

03:17:09.360 --> 03:17:11.360
vibrant and diverse counties.

03:17:11.360 --> 03:17:13.360
Please review each component of the accountability

03:17:13.360 --> 03:17:15.360
system to better represent

03:17:15.360 --> 03:17:17.360
what should be the approach for

03:17:17.360 --> 03:17:19.360
uplifting the needs of ELs which

03:17:19.360 --> 03:17:21.360
is aligned to principal 11.

03:17:21.360 --> 03:17:23.360
Thank you so much.

03:17:23.360 --> 03:17:25.360
Thank you. Next caller, please state

03:17:25.360 --> 03:17:27.360
your name and affiliation for the record.

03:17:27.360 --> 03:17:29.360
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

03:17:31.360 --> 03:17:33.360
Good afternoon.

03:17:33.360 --> 03:17:35.360
My name is Dr. Al Macasso

03:17:35.360 --> 03:17:37.360
from California Association

03:17:37.360 --> 03:17:39.360
for Bilingual Education,

03:17:39.360 --> 03:17:41.360
SCRAB-A, Multilingual California

03:17:41.360 --> 03:17:43.360
Project. I'm also a

03:17:43.360 --> 03:17:45.360
board member for Limwood Unified School District

03:17:45.360 --> 03:17:47.360
and University Professor in

03:17:47.360 --> 03:17:49.360
South State Long Beach.

03:17:49.360 --> 03:17:51.360
As a professor involved in future preparation,

03:17:51.360 --> 03:17:53.360
we look at the dashboard for

03:17:53.360 --> 03:17:55.360
data to look at their individual districts

03:17:55.360 --> 03:17:57.360
and classes.

03:17:57.360 --> 03:17:59.360
Here our students find

03:17:59.360 --> 03:18:01.360
the growth of their English learners.

03:18:01.360 --> 03:18:03.360
The data provided is not

03:18:03.360 --> 03:18:05.360
transparent, but misinforming

03:18:05.360 --> 03:18:07.360
our candidates of the actual needs

03:18:07.360 --> 03:18:09.360
of the students, minimizing the actual

03:18:09.360 --> 03:18:11.360
growth that should occur.

03:18:11.360 --> 03:18:13.360
When looking at the LCAP,

03:18:13.360 --> 03:18:15.360
students are often dismayed

03:18:15.360 --> 03:18:17.360
at the lack of goals and metrics

03:18:17.360 --> 03:18:19.360
for growth for English learners.

03:18:19.360 --> 03:18:21.360
We take our candidates to have

03:18:21.360 --> 03:18:23.360
high expectations, as described

03:18:23.360 --> 03:18:25.360
in principal five, and also

03:18:25.360 --> 03:18:27.360
to create an advocacy program

03:18:27.360 --> 03:18:29.360
in the classroom. However, the

03:18:29.360 --> 03:18:31.360
low expectations promoted for growth

03:18:31.360 --> 03:18:33.360
on the LCAP are

03:18:33.360 --> 03:18:35.360
not the needs of our current

03:18:35.360 --> 03:18:37.360
English learners in the academic indicators

03:18:37.360 --> 03:18:39.360
of confusing and leave our

03:18:39.360 --> 03:18:41.360
students with many questions.

03:18:41.360 --> 03:18:43.360
Today I encourage you to consider

03:18:43.360 --> 03:18:45.360
looking at the indicators on the dashboard

03:18:47.360 --> 03:18:49.360
and enhancing LCAP metrics.

03:18:49.360 --> 03:18:51.360
Thank you.

03:18:51.360 --> 03:18:53.360
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

03:18:53.360 --> 03:18:55.360
for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

03:18:59.360 --> 03:19:01.360
Good afternoon.

03:19:01.360 --> 03:19:03.360
My name is Eduardo Munoz, and I'm a professor

03:19:03.360 --> 03:19:05.360
at San Jose State University, where

03:19:05.360 --> 03:19:07.360
I am also a coordinator of a bilingual

03:19:07.360 --> 03:19:09.360
program, and I am supporting the

03:19:09.360 --> 03:19:11.360
point being made by California's Together.

03:19:11.360 --> 03:19:13.360
Santa Clara County enrolls over

03:19:13.360 --> 03:19:15.360
54,000 ELs,

03:19:15.360 --> 03:19:17.360
making up nearly one in four students.

03:19:17.360 --> 03:19:19.360
However, none of the districts

03:19:19.360 --> 03:19:21.360
in the country were required to write

03:19:21.360 --> 03:19:23.360
goals for EL-CAPs, and

03:19:23.360 --> 03:19:25.360
none would be identified

03:19:25.360 --> 03:19:27.360
based on the low expectations that are

03:19:27.360 --> 03:19:29.360
set by the ELP. Moreover,

03:19:29.360 --> 03:19:31.360
only two of the 31 districts

03:19:31.360 --> 03:19:33.360
were identified for differentiated

03:19:33.360 --> 03:19:35.360
assistance based on EL performance,

03:19:35.360 --> 03:19:37.360
and just six schools

03:19:37.360 --> 03:19:39.360
were identified for additional

03:19:39.360 --> 03:19:41.360
targeted support and improvement

03:19:41.360 --> 03:19:43.360
for EL performance.

03:19:43.360 --> 03:19:45.360
This information should cause us to want to

03:19:45.360 --> 03:19:47.360
take a look at the alignment of the results

03:19:47.360 --> 03:19:49.360
from the data on the dashboard

03:19:49.360 --> 03:19:51.360
to the needs of English learners, and what

03:19:51.360 --> 03:19:53.360
can the system do to make the needs of

03:19:53.360 --> 03:19:55.360
English learners visible and actionable?

03:19:55.360 --> 03:19:57.360
How is it possible that

03:19:57.360 --> 03:19:59.360
these students are not getting support?

03:19:59.360 --> 03:20:01.360
These organizations, these LEAs,

03:20:01.360 --> 03:20:03.360
are not being identified for support

03:20:03.360 --> 03:20:05.360
in the light of these results.

03:20:05.360 --> 03:20:07.360
We need your help and guidance

03:20:07.360 --> 03:20:09.360
to make these critical adjustments.

03:20:09.360 --> 03:20:11.360
Thank you very much for your time.

03:20:11.360 --> 03:20:13.360
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name

03:20:13.360 --> 03:20:15.360
and affiliation for the record. You have one minute.

03:20:15.360 --> 03:20:17.360
Your time starts now.

03:20:21.360 --> 03:20:23.360
Hello, my name is Dr. Krista Kaban,

03:20:23.360 --> 03:20:25.360
and I'm an educator at Glendale High School,

03:20:25.360 --> 03:20:27.360
teaching 175 9th

03:20:27.360 --> 03:20:29.360
and 10th grade ELB students.

03:20:29.360 --> 03:20:31.360
Half of my students are considered long-term

03:20:31.360 --> 03:20:33.360
English learners or at risk of becoming one.

03:20:33.360 --> 03:20:35.360
This is a significant number of students

03:20:35.360 --> 03:20:37.360
who reflect members across the state of California.

03:20:37.360 --> 03:20:39.360
It has led to a widening

03:20:39.360 --> 03:20:41.360
achievement gap between this group of students

03:20:41.360 --> 03:20:43.360
and their peers. The current system

03:20:43.360 --> 03:20:45.360
hides outcomes for ELB, especially our

03:20:45.360 --> 03:20:47.360
secondary students. Through my doctoral

03:20:47.360 --> 03:20:49.360
and field work, long-term English learners

03:20:49.360 --> 03:20:51.360
have also mentioned not understanding

03:20:51.360 --> 03:20:53.360
the pathway towards reclassification

03:20:53.360 --> 03:20:55.360
and felt a stigma patch of label.

03:20:55.360 --> 03:20:57.360
We need an accountability system that will

03:20:57.360 --> 03:20:59.360
no longer make these students invisible.

03:20:59.360 --> 03:21:01.360
Now that the governor has signed AB 1868,

03:21:01.360 --> 03:21:03.360
we hope that as the

03:21:03.360 --> 03:21:05.360
accountability system is reviewed,

03:21:05.360 --> 03:21:07.360
we might find a way to ensure that meeting the needs

03:21:07.360 --> 03:21:09.360
of ELB health is incorporated.

03:21:09.360 --> 03:21:11.360
Thank you for listening. Thank you.

03:21:11.360 --> 03:21:13.360
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

03:21:13.360 --> 03:21:15.360
for the record. You have one minute. Your time

03:21:15.360 --> 03:21:17.360
starts now.

03:21:19.360 --> 03:21:21.360
Hi, my name is Robert Manwearing

03:21:21.360 --> 03:21:23.360
from Children Now. We'd like to associate

03:21:23.360 --> 03:21:25.360
ourselves with the comments of

03:21:25.360 --> 03:21:27.360
CalTOG, the Equity Coalition,

03:21:27.360 --> 03:21:29.360
and public advocates around the

03:21:29.360 --> 03:21:31.360
AL issues raised today.

03:21:31.360 --> 03:21:33.360
I wanted to add one more issue

03:21:33.360 --> 03:21:35.360
to the plate. Specifically, we'd

03:21:35.360 --> 03:21:37.360
like to see a 12th principle

03:21:37.360 --> 03:21:39.360
added that would state something to the effect

03:21:39.360 --> 03:21:41.360
of additional state and local

03:21:41.360 --> 03:21:43.360
indicators may be added to the dashboard

03:21:43.360 --> 03:21:45.360
that support LCFF

03:21:45.360 --> 03:21:47.360
state priorities. The reason

03:21:47.360 --> 03:21:49.360
we think this additional

03:21:49.360 --> 03:21:51.360
principle is needed is

03:21:51.360 --> 03:21:53.360
when you look at the interaction

03:21:53.360 --> 03:21:55.360
of the valuing

03:21:55.360 --> 03:21:57.360
indicators equally principal,

03:21:57.360 --> 03:21:59.360
which is number four, and the

03:21:59.360 --> 03:22:01.360
requirements of ESSA around

03:22:01.360 --> 03:22:03.360
weighting of indicators, it seems

03:22:03.360 --> 03:22:05.360
like it might create a barrier to

03:22:05.360 --> 03:22:07.360
adding additional indicators like

03:22:07.360 --> 03:22:09.360
science or a growth model

03:22:09.360 --> 03:22:11.360
or currently high school chronic

03:22:11.360 --> 03:22:13.360
absence rates,

03:22:13.360 --> 03:22:15.360
which has already been banned from the

03:22:15.360 --> 03:22:17.360
dashboard because of this interaction

03:22:17.360 --> 03:22:19.360
or teacher assessment.

03:22:19.360 --> 03:22:21.360
So we'd like you to take a deeper look at

03:22:21.360 --> 03:22:23.360
the weighting of indicators

03:22:23.360 --> 03:22:25.360
and how additional indicators

03:22:25.360 --> 03:22:27.360
could be added in the future. Thank you

03:22:27.360 --> 03:22:29.360
so much. Thank you.

03:22:29.360 --> 03:22:31.360
That concludes public comment for item

03:22:31.360 --> 03:22:33.360
number 13.

03:22:33.360 --> 03:22:35.360
Thank you so much,

03:22:35.360 --> 03:22:37.360
and I want to give Vice President

03:22:37.360 --> 03:22:39.360
Glover Woods an opportunity to

03:22:39.360 --> 03:22:41.360
frame some comments before we get

03:22:41.360 --> 03:22:43.360
started on our discussion.

03:22:43.360 --> 03:22:45.360
Okay, thank you. Can you hear me?

03:22:45.360 --> 03:22:47.360
No? Yay. All right.

03:22:47.360 --> 03:22:49.360
Thank you.

03:22:49.360 --> 03:22:51.360
Thank you very much, President Valenzuela.

03:22:51.360 --> 03:22:53.360
And thank you to all those who

03:22:53.360 --> 03:22:55.360
called in. Just a couple of framing

03:22:55.360 --> 03:22:57.360
comments before we

03:22:57.360 --> 03:22:59.360
continue into our discussion.

03:22:59.360 --> 03:23:01.360
Along the line

03:23:01.360 --> 03:23:03.360
of, again, giving thanks,

03:23:03.360 --> 03:23:05.360
much thanks to all of the

03:23:05.360 --> 03:23:07.360
educational partners and the

03:23:07.360 --> 03:23:09.360
CPAC members for giving

03:23:09.360 --> 03:23:11.360
feedback on the dashboard principles

03:23:11.360 --> 03:23:13.360
and for CDE for taking all of that

03:23:13.360 --> 03:23:15.360
feedback along with the feedback

03:23:15.360 --> 03:23:17.360
from this board to

03:23:17.360 --> 03:23:19.360
revamp and revise

03:23:19.360 --> 03:23:21.360
the principles. I think one of the key

03:23:21.360 --> 03:23:23.360
pieces is understanding

03:23:23.360 --> 03:23:25.360
that these principles, as was

03:23:25.360 --> 03:23:27.360
suggested in the presentation,

03:23:27.360 --> 03:23:29.360
will continue to come back

03:23:29.360 --> 03:23:31.360
for review, continue to come back

03:23:31.360 --> 03:23:33.360
for revisions that may be needed

03:23:33.360 --> 03:23:35.360
as time evolves. So

03:23:35.360 --> 03:23:37.360
quite excited about that.

03:23:37.360 --> 03:23:39.360
There is something in our

03:23:39.360 --> 03:23:41.360
current draft of

03:23:41.360 --> 03:23:43.360
principles that I would like to point

03:23:43.360 --> 03:23:45.360
out and ask that we make

03:23:45.360 --> 03:23:47.360
an adjustment to, and that

03:23:47.360 --> 03:23:49.360
is the use of the word

03:23:49.360 --> 03:23:51.360
accountability system or system

03:23:51.360 --> 03:23:53.360
in the areas where it

03:23:53.360 --> 03:23:55.360
should really refer to dashboard

03:23:55.360 --> 03:23:57.360
because these principles

03:23:57.360 --> 03:23:59.360
that are before us for approval

03:23:59.360 --> 03:24:01.360
are in relation to

03:24:01.360 --> 03:24:03.360
the dashboard. The accountability

03:24:03.360 --> 03:24:05.360
system, of course, is a much larger

03:24:05.360 --> 03:24:07.360
entity

03:24:07.360 --> 03:24:09.360
of which the dashboard is one

03:24:09.360 --> 03:24:11.360
component. So I

03:24:11.360 --> 03:24:13.360
will bring it forward in a motion, but

03:24:13.360 --> 03:24:15.360
I just want to bring this forward for

03:24:15.360 --> 03:24:17.360
consideration of the board, which

03:24:17.360 --> 03:24:19.360
is that in principles

03:24:19.360 --> 03:24:21.360
1, 5, 6,

03:24:21.360 --> 03:24:23.360
7, 8, 9, and 11

03:24:23.360 --> 03:24:25.360
would be appropriate

03:24:25.360 --> 03:24:27.360
to replace the words accountability

03:24:27.360 --> 03:24:29.360
system and system

03:24:29.360 --> 03:24:31.360
with the word dashboard

03:24:31.360 --> 03:24:33.360
so that, again, the principles

03:24:33.360 --> 03:24:35.360
align and the language

03:24:35.360 --> 03:24:37.360
in each of the principles aligns

03:24:37.360 --> 03:24:39.360
to the dashboard

03:24:39.360 --> 03:24:41.360
itself. So, again, just wanted to

03:24:41.360 --> 03:24:43.360
point that out. Just

03:24:43.360 --> 03:24:45.360
another comment or two

03:24:45.360 --> 03:24:47.360
before we continue with our

03:24:47.360 --> 03:24:49.360
discussion, which is in

03:24:49.360 --> 03:24:51.360
relation to the

03:24:51.360 --> 03:24:53.360
LCAP requirements for English

03:24:53.360 --> 03:24:55.360
learners and how

03:24:55.360 --> 03:24:57.360
it is to be reflected in the

03:24:57.360 --> 03:24:59.360
LCAP. As Josh Strong

03:24:59.360 --> 03:25:01.360
went through, and I can say also as

03:25:01.360 --> 03:25:03.360
a former county office administrator, I

03:25:03.360 --> 03:25:05.360
know that the requirement

03:25:05.360 --> 03:25:07.360
for the needs of

03:25:07.360 --> 03:25:09.360
English learners to be addressed in

03:25:09.360 --> 03:25:11.360
the LCAP are quite

03:25:11.360 --> 03:25:13.360
extensive, and these are not

03:25:13.360 --> 03:25:15.360
may-dos, if you will, but

03:25:15.360 --> 03:25:17.360
must-dos because our English

03:25:17.360 --> 03:25:19.360
learners are part of the unduplicated

03:25:19.360 --> 03:25:21.360
people group that generates

03:25:21.360 --> 03:25:23.360
supplemental dollars.

03:25:23.360 --> 03:25:25.360
So actions and services

03:25:25.360 --> 03:25:27.360
for increased actions,

03:25:27.360 --> 03:25:29.360
increased supports

03:25:29.360 --> 03:25:31.360
and services, I should say,

03:25:31.360 --> 03:25:33.360
are to be reflected in the LCAP. So

03:25:35.360 --> 03:25:37.360
concerned with many of

03:25:37.360 --> 03:25:39.360
the communications that we've received

03:25:39.360 --> 03:25:41.360
in our box as well as what we've

03:25:41.360 --> 03:25:43.360
heard in public comment, I'm going

03:25:43.360 --> 03:25:45.360
to need a little bit of clarification as

03:25:45.360 --> 03:25:47.360
to how these requirements are in place,

03:25:47.360 --> 03:25:49.360
but yet it's

03:25:49.360 --> 03:25:51.360
being said that

03:25:51.360 --> 03:25:53.360
there are no LCAP goals

03:25:53.360 --> 03:25:55.360
for LEAs in such

03:25:55.360 --> 03:25:57.360
an extensive manner across the state.

03:25:57.360 --> 03:25:59.360
One other

03:25:59.360 --> 03:26:01.360
aspect I just want to point out

03:26:01.360 --> 03:26:03.360
for conversation

03:26:03.360 --> 03:26:05.360
is that

03:26:05.360 --> 03:26:07.360
the majority of county

03:26:07.360 --> 03:26:09.360
offices do go through a quite extensive

03:26:09.360 --> 03:26:11.360
process providing

03:26:11.360 --> 03:26:13.360
professional support

03:26:13.360 --> 03:26:15.360
to LEAs on the

03:26:15.360 --> 03:26:17.360
development of their LCAP as well as

03:26:17.360 --> 03:26:19.360
the review of the

03:26:19.360 --> 03:26:21.360
LCAP itself, and there's

03:26:21.360 --> 03:26:23.360
a lot of work done through

03:26:23.360 --> 03:26:25.360
the California County Superintendents

03:26:25.360 --> 03:26:27.360
Association, particularly

03:26:27.360 --> 03:26:29.360
the Curriculum Instruction Steering

03:26:29.360 --> 03:26:31.360
Committee, to ensure calibration

03:26:31.360 --> 03:26:33.360
across the state.

03:26:33.360 --> 03:26:35.360
So as was stated in one of the

03:26:35.360 --> 03:26:37.360
comments we heard during our public

03:26:37.360 --> 03:26:39.360
comment period, we had a wonderful

03:26:39.360 --> 03:26:41.360
example from the Sacramento

03:26:41.360 --> 03:26:43.360
County Office of Education.

03:26:43.360 --> 03:26:45.360
We know there are county offices of education

03:26:45.360 --> 03:26:47.360
that are really going through quite an

03:26:47.360 --> 03:26:49.360
extensive way and providing a lot of

03:26:49.360 --> 03:26:51.360
important information

03:26:51.360 --> 03:26:53.360
to LEAs on how to look at

03:26:53.360 --> 03:26:55.360
the needs of English learners and how to

03:26:55.360 --> 03:26:57.360
reflect that and also look at disaggregating

03:26:57.360 --> 03:26:59.360
that data. I also

03:26:59.360 --> 03:27:01.360
would suggest that we

03:27:01.360 --> 03:27:03.360
look at those models and

03:27:03.360 --> 03:27:05.360
continue to share those

03:27:05.360 --> 03:27:07.360
models across the state for

03:27:07.360 --> 03:27:09.360
those that might

03:27:09.360 --> 03:27:11.360
still be wondering how to best

03:27:11.360 --> 03:27:13.360
make sure that English learners

03:27:13.360 --> 03:27:15.360
and the needs of our English learners at all

03:27:15.360 --> 03:27:17.360
different levels are actually being

03:27:17.360 --> 03:27:19.360
addressed. I believe

03:27:19.360 --> 03:27:21.360
at this point that concludes

03:27:21.360 --> 03:27:23.360
any framing comments that I might

03:27:23.360 --> 03:27:25.360
have, and I'll save anything else

03:27:25.360 --> 03:27:27.360
I have for our ongoing discussion.

03:27:27.360 --> 03:27:29.360
Thank you.

03:27:29.360 --> 03:27:31.360
And I am the other liaison

03:27:31.360 --> 03:27:33.360
for accountability, so I have a few

03:27:33.360 --> 03:27:35.360
framing comments and then I see we have

03:27:35.360 --> 03:27:37.360
discussion pending with

03:27:37.360 --> 03:27:39.360
some board members ready to dive in.

03:27:39.360 --> 03:27:41.360
I also want to just thank the

03:27:41.360 --> 03:27:43.360
department for providing all of

03:27:43.360 --> 03:27:45.360
the many slices of English learner data.

03:27:45.360 --> 03:27:47.360
And I think

03:27:47.360 --> 03:27:49.360
the issue that we're

03:27:49.360 --> 03:27:51.360
surfacing and that we want

03:27:51.360 --> 03:27:53.360
to come back and deal with

03:27:53.360 --> 03:27:55.360
is the fact that

03:27:55.360 --> 03:27:57.360
what is not a trigger

03:27:57.360 --> 03:27:59.360
right now for

03:27:59.360 --> 03:28:01.360
LCAP attention

03:28:01.360 --> 03:28:03.360
is the

03:28:03.360 --> 03:28:05.360
progress of English learners as it is

03:28:05.360 --> 03:28:07.360
reflected in the LP data

03:28:07.360 --> 03:28:09.360
and in the

03:28:09.360 --> 03:28:11.360
at-risk and long-term

03:28:11.360 --> 03:28:13.360
English learner data. Those are

03:28:13.360 --> 03:28:15.360
available to people, but we do not

03:28:15.360 --> 03:28:17.360
currently have a requirement

03:28:17.360 --> 03:28:19.360
that they be

03:28:19.360 --> 03:28:21.360
a basis for

03:28:21.360 --> 03:28:23.360
planning and investing.

03:28:23.360 --> 03:28:25.360
And so I'd love for our

03:28:25.360 --> 03:28:27.360
department staff to come back

03:28:27.360 --> 03:28:29.360
to us in the next meeting.

03:28:29.360 --> 03:28:31.360
And as we're thinking about how to

03:28:31.360 --> 03:28:33.360
start a new three-year

03:28:33.360 --> 03:28:35.360
LCAP cycle in 2024,

03:28:35.360 --> 03:28:37.360
we need to plan for any changes

03:28:37.360 --> 03:28:39.360
in the LCAP now.

03:28:39.360 --> 03:28:41.360
I'd like us to take the opportunity

03:28:41.360 --> 03:28:43.360
to take a look at the LCAP instructions,

03:28:43.360 --> 03:28:45.360
provide recommendations to the

03:28:45.360 --> 03:28:47.360
board on where they could be strengthened

03:28:47.360 --> 03:28:49.360
to ensure that a deep data analysis

03:28:49.360 --> 03:28:51.360
around

03:28:51.360 --> 03:28:53.360
LCAP planning for English learners

03:28:53.360 --> 03:28:55.360
includes LTELs

03:28:55.360 --> 03:28:57.360
and at-risk of long-term

03:28:57.360 --> 03:28:59.360
English learner status

03:28:59.360 --> 03:29:01.360
and a look at the progress

03:29:01.360 --> 03:29:03.360
that is shown in the LP indicator.

03:29:03.360 --> 03:29:05.360
We got started on this, and we

03:29:05.360 --> 03:29:07.360
started the conversation today about

03:29:07.360 --> 03:29:09.360
how the

03:29:09.360 --> 03:29:11.360
Department of Education in Washington had

03:29:11.360 --> 03:29:13.360
created a category and then

03:29:13.360 --> 03:29:15.360
used that category for accountability

03:29:15.360 --> 03:29:17.360
in ways that were

03:29:17.360 --> 03:29:19.360
problematic because

03:29:19.360 --> 03:29:21.360
districts making

03:29:21.360 --> 03:29:23.360
very strong gains using

03:29:23.360 --> 03:29:25.360
the definitions that were required

03:29:25.360 --> 03:29:27.360
could be put into

03:29:27.360 --> 03:29:29.360
sanctions, could have schools

03:29:29.360 --> 03:29:31.360
closed, could have teachers,

03:29:31.360 --> 03:29:33.360
staff reconstituted,

03:29:33.360 --> 03:29:35.360
even as they were making good progress because

03:29:35.360 --> 03:29:37.360
the indicator itself

03:29:37.360 --> 03:29:39.360
was badly constructed for the

03:29:39.360 --> 03:29:41.360
purpose of seeing whether a district

03:29:41.360 --> 03:29:43.360
was helping its learners

03:29:43.360 --> 03:29:45.360
progress. But we have another

03:29:45.360 --> 03:29:47.360
need,

03:29:47.360 --> 03:29:49.360
we've redefined that category,

03:29:49.360 --> 03:29:51.360
but we have another need, which is to have

03:29:51.360 --> 03:29:53.360
an indicator really looked at

03:29:53.360 --> 03:29:55.360
for the LCAP

03:29:55.360 --> 03:29:57.360
that shows progression

03:29:57.360 --> 03:29:59.360
directly for LPs

03:29:59.360 --> 03:30:01.360
and for students who may be at risk

03:30:01.360 --> 03:30:03.360
of long-term English learners.

03:30:03.360 --> 03:30:05.360
I'd also like to ask the 2023

03:30:05.360 --> 03:30:07.360
dashboard work plan to

03:30:07.360 --> 03:30:09.360
include work that will strengthen our reporting

03:30:09.360 --> 03:30:11.360
on the English learner student

03:30:11.360 --> 03:30:13.360
group, specifically those

03:30:13.360 --> 03:30:15.360
categories that I've just identified

03:30:15.360 --> 03:30:17.360
and I hope we'll come back

03:30:17.360 --> 03:30:19.360
and be able to take a look at that.

03:30:19.360 --> 03:30:21.360
On the

03:30:21.360 --> 03:30:23.360
principles, we've heard a lot

03:30:23.360 --> 03:30:25.360
of good ideas for wordsmithing

03:30:25.360 --> 03:30:27.360
the principles. We just heard

03:30:27.360 --> 03:30:29.360
from Vice President Glover Woods

03:30:29.360 --> 03:30:31.360
the proposal to be clear about

03:30:31.360 --> 03:30:33.360
the fact that they pertain to the

03:30:33.360 --> 03:30:35.360
dashboard and not the entire

03:30:35.360 --> 03:30:37.360
accountability system. We heard

03:30:37.360 --> 03:30:39.360
from public comment and from some of

03:30:39.360 --> 03:30:41.360
the letters the

03:30:41.360 --> 03:30:43.360
I think valuable idea

03:30:43.360 --> 03:30:45.360
to delete the term

03:30:45.360 --> 03:30:47.360
equally from principle four because it

03:30:47.360 --> 03:30:49.360
still can be misread

03:30:49.360 --> 03:30:51.360
and perhaps to introduce the term

03:30:51.360 --> 03:30:53.360
well-rounded into principle one

03:30:53.360 --> 03:30:55.360
which I think reflects our goals

03:30:55.360 --> 03:30:57.360
so I would like to just

03:30:57.360 --> 03:30:59.360
pre-offer

03:30:59.360 --> 03:31:01.360
those ideas

03:31:01.360 --> 03:31:03.360
as well as we take up the principles.

03:31:03.360 --> 03:31:05.360
We do have a commitment

03:31:05.360 --> 03:31:07.360
from the department to bring those back every

03:31:07.360 --> 03:31:09.360
year so if we

03:31:09.360 --> 03:31:11.360
can enact something

03:31:11.360 --> 03:31:13.360
today with some

03:31:13.360 --> 03:31:15.360
of the wordsmithing we can continue

03:31:15.360 --> 03:31:17.360
to work with the department on those

03:31:17.360 --> 03:31:19.360
in the future.

03:31:19.360 --> 03:31:21.360
And so now I know that

03:31:21.360 --> 03:31:23.360
Member Escobedo and Member Arrozco-Gonzalez

03:31:23.360 --> 03:31:25.360
are ready to dive in.

03:31:25.360 --> 03:31:27.360
Member Escobedo, do you want to start your hand

03:31:27.360 --> 03:31:29.360
up first? Yes, I just

03:31:29.360 --> 03:31:31.360
pretty much

03:31:31.360 --> 03:31:33.360
wanted to emphasize the importance

03:31:33.360 --> 03:31:35.360
of following long-term

03:31:35.360 --> 03:31:37.360
ELs as well as

03:31:37.360 --> 03:31:39.360
at-risk which you beautifully

03:31:39.360 --> 03:31:41.360
stated and also

03:31:41.360 --> 03:31:43.360
ensure even though

03:31:43.360 --> 03:31:45.360
I heard from Dr.

03:31:45.360 --> 03:31:47.360
Glover-Woods that counties

03:31:47.360 --> 03:31:49.360
do calibrate themselves

03:31:49.360 --> 03:31:51.360
I just want to make

03:31:51.360 --> 03:31:53.360
sure that

03:31:53.360 --> 03:31:55.360
they're also

03:31:55.360 --> 03:31:57.360
utilizing similar resources such

03:31:57.360 --> 03:31:59.360
as EL Rise that I think

03:31:59.360 --> 03:32:01.360
is a great roadmap to

03:32:01.360 --> 03:32:03.360
follow and I know Sacramento

03:32:03.360 --> 03:32:05.360
uses it as an anchor

03:32:05.360 --> 03:32:07.360
so I just hope also

03:32:07.360 --> 03:32:09.360
the assistance

03:32:09.360 --> 03:32:11.360
comes from

03:32:11.360 --> 03:32:13.360
a similar source as well.

03:32:13.360 --> 03:32:15.360
So just wanted to share

03:32:15.360 --> 03:32:17.360
those two points.

03:32:17.360 --> 03:32:19.360
Thank you. Member Arrozco-Gonzalez?

03:32:23.360 --> 03:32:25.360
Thank you.

03:32:25.360 --> 03:32:27.360
I want to thank

03:32:27.360 --> 03:32:29.360
Vice President Glover-Woods

03:32:29.360 --> 03:32:31.360
for saying that the principles are malleable

03:32:31.360 --> 03:32:33.360
and could be revisited.

03:32:33.360 --> 03:32:35.360
I think that I heard

03:32:35.360 --> 03:32:37.360
quite a bit of the callers including

03:32:37.360 --> 03:32:39.360
the California Association of Science

03:32:39.360 --> 03:32:41.360
asking about the language

03:32:41.360 --> 03:32:43.360
of principle four that states

03:32:43.360 --> 03:32:45.360
the values of each indicator

03:32:45.360 --> 03:32:47.360
equally and I know you

03:32:47.360 --> 03:32:49.360
mentioned also

03:32:49.360 --> 03:32:51.360
Vice President Darling-Hammond

03:32:51.360 --> 03:32:53.360
about looking into the words

03:32:53.360 --> 03:32:55.360
of that indicator since

03:32:55.360 --> 03:32:57.360
the word equally brings back concerns

03:32:57.360 --> 03:32:59.360
about weight unnecessarily.

03:32:59.360 --> 03:33:01.360
So I think the equal weighting approach

03:33:01.360 --> 03:33:03.360
could result in unintended consequences

03:33:03.360 --> 03:33:05.360
so maybe revisiting the language

03:33:05.360 --> 03:33:07.360
on that principle.

03:33:07.360 --> 03:33:09.360
And also I want to mention

03:33:09.360 --> 03:33:11.360
about how we are a highly

03:33:11.360 --> 03:33:13.360
multilingual state and we need

03:33:13.360 --> 03:33:15.360
to make sure that the support is available

03:33:15.360 --> 03:33:17.360
in particular for English learners.

03:33:17.360 --> 03:33:19.360
With the revision of the principles

03:33:19.360 --> 03:33:21.360
I see an opportunity for us

03:33:21.360 --> 03:33:23.360
to review the consequences of the

03:33:23.360 --> 03:33:25.360
indicators and the alignment

03:33:25.360 --> 03:33:27.360
to the principles. I would suggest

03:33:27.360 --> 03:33:29.360
the CDE include in their accountability

03:33:29.360 --> 03:33:31.360
work plan a review of the impact

03:33:31.360 --> 03:33:33.360
of the current academic indicator,

03:33:33.360 --> 03:33:35.360
the cut scores of the LPI,

03:33:35.360 --> 03:33:37.360
and the criteria requiring districts to

03:33:37.360 --> 03:33:39.360
include go for student subgroups

03:33:39.360 --> 03:33:41.360
in their LCAP.

03:33:41.360 --> 03:33:43.360
And now is the time to look for

03:33:43.360 --> 03:33:45.360
a 2023 dashboard

03:33:45.360 --> 03:33:47.360
and it would be good to see

03:33:47.360 --> 03:33:49.360
the options for next year.

03:33:49.360 --> 03:33:51.360
Terrific. So I think we're going to

03:33:51.360 --> 03:33:53.360
have a meaty conversation in our next

03:33:53.360 --> 03:33:55.360
meeting about how we can

03:33:55.360 --> 03:33:57.360
address the

03:33:57.360 --> 03:33:59.360
English learner indicators.

03:34:01.360 --> 03:34:03.360
Knowing that we

03:34:03.360 --> 03:34:05.360
Yes, would you like to

03:34:05.360 --> 03:34:07.360
Just to clarify,

03:34:07.360 --> 03:34:09.360
your next meeting that we will be presenting

03:34:09.360 --> 03:34:11.360
at is March.

03:34:11.360 --> 03:34:13.360
We will not be able to come in January

03:34:13.360 --> 03:34:15.360
because we're going to be putting out a dashboard

03:34:15.360 --> 03:34:17.360
in December. So I just want to make sure

03:34:17.360 --> 03:34:19.360
as far as timing goes that we're on the same

03:34:19.360 --> 03:34:21.360
page for when

03:34:21.360 --> 03:34:23.360
you will see an accountability item

03:34:23.360 --> 03:34:25.360
around the dashboard.

03:34:25.360 --> 03:34:27.360
Okay.

03:34:27.360 --> 03:34:29.360
As soon as we can,

03:34:29.360 --> 03:34:31.360
we want to all deliver

03:34:31.360 --> 03:34:33.360
speed to begin

03:34:33.360 --> 03:34:35.360
considering these alternatives

03:34:35.360 --> 03:34:37.360
so that we can learn what's possible.

03:34:37.360 --> 03:34:39.360
Absolutely. Thank you.

03:34:41.360 --> 03:34:43.360
So I would like to, because

03:34:43.360 --> 03:34:45.360
we know that that's an important issue

03:34:45.360 --> 03:34:47.360
and we've heard from board members and

03:34:47.360 --> 03:34:49.360
the public that we need to address it,

03:34:49.360 --> 03:34:51.360
put that

03:34:51.360 --> 03:34:53.360
to our next opportunity

03:34:53.360 --> 03:34:55.360
to have that conversation and

03:34:55.360 --> 03:34:57.360
focus in on the item that we need to

03:34:57.360 --> 03:34:59.360
consider for approval,

03:34:59.360 --> 03:35:01.360
which is the dashboard principles.

03:35:01.360 --> 03:35:03.360
And

03:35:03.360 --> 03:35:05.360
what I've

03:35:05.360 --> 03:35:07.360
heard thus far is

03:35:07.360 --> 03:35:09.360
several potential small

03:35:09.360 --> 03:35:11.360
amendments to the principles,

03:35:11.360 --> 03:35:13.360
which maybe Vice President

03:35:13.360 --> 03:35:15.360
Glover Woods is about to summarize

03:35:15.360 --> 03:35:17.360
for us

03:35:17.360 --> 03:35:19.360
so that we can move

03:35:19.360 --> 03:35:21.360
them forward in a way that we

03:35:21.360 --> 03:35:23.360
understand will be able to be a living,

03:35:23.360 --> 03:35:25.360
breathing document that can be further

03:35:25.360 --> 03:35:27.360
revised. Vice President Glover Woods.

03:35:27.360 --> 03:35:29.360
Thank you, President

03:35:29.360 --> 03:35:31.360
Darlingham. And before I move forward

03:35:31.360 --> 03:35:33.360
with the

03:35:33.360 --> 03:35:35.360
motion, which will be somewhat

03:35:35.360 --> 03:35:37.360
amended, I want to be

03:35:37.360 --> 03:35:39.360
sure that I've captured

03:35:39.360 --> 03:35:41.360
the suggested

03:35:41.360 --> 03:35:43.360
amendments to the emotion, if you will.

03:35:43.360 --> 03:35:45.360
So in addition

03:35:45.360 --> 03:35:47.360
to the word

03:35:47.360 --> 03:35:49.360
changing, again, of accountability system

03:35:49.360 --> 03:35:51.360
and system to dashboard,

03:35:51.360 --> 03:35:53.360
I have noted to

03:35:53.360 --> 03:35:55.360
remove the word equally

03:35:55.360 --> 03:35:57.360
from principle number four. I want to confirm

03:35:57.360 --> 03:35:59.360
that I got that note correctly.

03:35:59.360 --> 03:36:01.360
And

03:36:01.360 --> 03:36:03.360
signal waiting, yes. Okay.

03:36:03.360 --> 03:36:05.360
And to

03:36:05.360 --> 03:36:07.360
for dashboard principle

03:36:07.360 --> 03:36:09.360
one, it was

03:36:09.360 --> 03:36:11.360
to look at

03:36:11.360 --> 03:36:13.360
was it removing

03:36:13.360 --> 03:36:15.360
the word well rounded or adding

03:36:15.360 --> 03:36:17.360
Incorporating the word

03:36:17.360 --> 03:36:19.360
well rounded. Incorporating

03:36:19.360 --> 03:36:21.360
the word well rounded

03:36:21.360 --> 03:36:23.360
in principle one, because I'm noting that

03:36:23.360 --> 03:36:25.360
it is

03:36:25.360 --> 03:36:27.360
well rounded as in the principle

03:36:27.360 --> 03:36:29.360
currently. Okay.

03:36:29.360 --> 03:36:31.360
So I just would like to clarify

03:36:31.360 --> 03:36:33.360
what adjustment we want. There was a couple of comments

03:36:33.360 --> 03:36:35.360
to that effect, and maybe it got

03:36:35.360 --> 03:36:37.360
added right before

03:36:37.360 --> 03:36:39.360
we got here to look

03:36:39.360 --> 03:36:41.360
at it. So that's great.

03:36:41.360 --> 03:36:43.360
So just really the principle

03:36:43.360 --> 03:36:45.360
four, which we heard several

03:36:45.360 --> 03:36:47.360
comments on.

03:36:47.360 --> 03:36:49.360
Okay. And

03:36:49.360 --> 03:36:51.360
again, I second that the emotion

03:36:51.360 --> 03:36:53.360
of having our additional

03:36:53.360 --> 03:36:55.360
conversation. We still have a lot of things

03:36:55.360 --> 03:36:57.360
to talk about as it relates to making

03:36:57.360 --> 03:36:59.360
sure our English learner data is accurately

03:36:59.360 --> 03:37:01.360
reflecting the needs of our English

03:37:01.360 --> 03:37:03.360
learners. So President

03:37:03.360 --> 03:37:05.360
Darling-Hammond, if it's okay,

03:37:05.360 --> 03:37:07.360
I can move forward with the motion.

03:37:07.360 --> 03:37:09.360
All right. Okay.

03:37:09.360 --> 03:37:11.360
I'd like to

03:37:11.360 --> 03:37:13.360
move that we

03:37:13.360 --> 03:37:15.360
adopt

03:37:15.360 --> 03:37:17.360
the revised dashboard

03:37:17.360 --> 03:37:19.360
principles with the

03:37:19.360 --> 03:37:21.360
following amendments

03:37:21.360 --> 03:37:23.360
to those principles.

03:37:23.360 --> 03:37:25.360
We want to replace

03:37:25.360 --> 03:37:27.360
the words accountability system

03:37:27.360 --> 03:37:29.360
and system with

03:37:29.360 --> 03:37:31.360
the word dashboard

03:37:31.360 --> 03:37:33.360
in any of the principles where

03:37:33.360 --> 03:37:35.360
that language

03:37:35.360 --> 03:37:37.360
still exists. We would also

03:37:37.360 --> 03:37:39.360
like to remove the word

03:37:39.360 --> 03:37:41.360
equally from dashboard

03:37:41.360 --> 03:37:43.360
principle number four

03:37:43.360 --> 03:37:45.360
so that it reads

03:37:45.360 --> 03:37:47.360
values each indicator.

03:37:47.360 --> 03:37:49.360
Do I have a second

03:37:49.360 --> 03:37:51.360
on that motion?

03:37:51.360 --> 03:37:53.360
Second. Thank you.

03:37:53.360 --> 03:37:55.360
Any further discussion?

03:37:55.360 --> 03:37:57.360
I will note that there was

03:37:57.360 --> 03:37:59.360
a caller who asked

03:37:59.360 --> 03:38:01.360
about adding a principle

03:38:01.360 --> 03:38:03.360
that would allow for us to evolve

03:38:03.360 --> 03:38:05.360
the dashboard. I think we

03:38:05.360 --> 03:38:07.360
assume that. So

03:38:07.360 --> 03:38:09.360
we can accept

03:38:09.360 --> 03:38:11.360
that idea in

03:38:11.360 --> 03:38:13.360
principle, but not in the principles.

03:38:13.360 --> 03:38:15.360
So with

03:38:15.360 --> 03:38:17.360
that, I guess we need

03:38:17.360 --> 03:38:19.360
a roll call vote.

03:38:19.360 --> 03:38:21.360
President Darlin-Hammond.

03:38:21.360 --> 03:38:23.360
Aye. Member Escobedo.

03:38:23.360 --> 03:38:25.360
Aye. Vice President

03:38:25.360 --> 03:38:27.360

Yes. Member Rodriguez.

03:38:47.360 --> 03:38:49.360
Yes.

03:38:49.360 --> 03:38:51.360
Member Yoshimoto-Towry.

03:38:51.360 --> 03:38:53.360
Yes. Motion

03:38:53.360 --> 03:38:55.360
carries unanimously.

03:38:55.360 --> 03:38:57.360
All right. Thank you so

03:38:57.360 --> 03:38:59.360
much. And thank you

03:38:59.360 --> 03:39:01.360
Cindy, Josh, and our

03:39:01.360 --> 03:39:03.360
friends from the Sacramento County Office of Education

03:39:03.360 --> 03:39:05.360
for that presentation.

03:39:05.360 --> 03:39:07.360
We are now going to

03:39:07.360 --> 03:39:09.360
reopen item one to take

03:39:09.360 --> 03:39:11.360
action on the preliminary report of

03:39:11.360 --> 03:39:13.360

2022 Meeting Minutes,

03:39:15.360 --> 03:39:17.360
the State Board of Education Screening Committee

03:39:17.360 --> 03:39:19.360

03:39:19.360 --> 03:39:21.360

and the Instructional Quality Commission,

03:39:25.360 --> 03:39:27.360
and report on our liaison assignments.

03:39:27.360 --> 03:39:29.360
We want to do that

03:39:29.360 --> 03:39:31.360
expeditiously so that

03:39:31.360 --> 03:39:33.360
those who need to get to lunch can do

03:39:33.360 --> 03:39:35.360
so. While we're waiting for

03:39:35.360 --> 03:39:37.360
any members of the public to call in,

03:39:37.360 --> 03:39:39.360
we've posted the public comment slide.

03:39:39.360 --> 03:39:41.360
Do I have a motion from a board member

03:39:41.360 --> 03:39:43.360
to approve the September 2022

03:39:43.360 --> 03:39:45.360

03:39:47.360 --> 03:39:49.360

03:39:49.360 --> 03:39:51.360
So moved.

03:39:51.360 --> 03:39:53.360
Thank you. Second.

03:39:53.360 --> 03:39:55.360
Thank you very much.

03:39:55.360 --> 03:39:57.360
And is there

03:39:57.360 --> 03:39:59.360
any public comment?

03:40:03.360 --> 03:40:05.360
No, we currently

03:40:05.360 --> 03:40:07.360
do not have anyone for public comment.

03:40:07.360 --> 03:40:09.360
Okay, we'll now hold a roll call

03:40:09.360 --> 03:40:11.360
vote. Brooks, please

03:40:11.360 --> 03:40:13.360
call the roll. President Darling

03:40:13.360 --> 03:40:15.360

Yes. Motion carries

03:40:43.360 --> 03:40:45.360
unanimously.

03:40:45.360 --> 03:40:47.360
Okay, we're now going to take up

03:40:47.360 --> 03:40:49.360
the State Board Screening Committee's recommendations

03:40:49.360 --> 03:40:51.360
for appointments to several commissions.

03:40:51.360 --> 03:40:53.360
We need the public comment

03:40:53.360 --> 03:40:55.360
slide back up because we're

03:40:55.360 --> 03:40:57.360
reopening the phone line for public

03:40:57.360 --> 03:40:59.360
comment. Thank you very much.

03:40:59.360 --> 03:41:01.360
Members of the public wishing to provide comment

03:41:01.360 --> 03:41:03.360
on this item may do so by calling

03:41:03.360 --> 03:41:05.360
the telephone number and using the

03:41:05.360 --> 03:41:07.360

03:41:07.360 --> 03:41:09.360
is shown now. And while we're

03:41:09.360 --> 03:41:11.360
waiting for any members of the public to call

03:41:11.360 --> 03:41:13.360
in, I'll ask Vice President Glover

03:41:13.360 --> 03:41:15.360
Woods, who chaired this year's process

03:41:15.360 --> 03:41:17.360
with our great thanks,

03:41:17.360 --> 03:41:19.360
to share the recommendations

03:41:19.360 --> 03:41:21.360
from the State Board Screening Committee

03:41:21.360 --> 03:41:23.360
regarding appointments to the Advisory

03:41:23.360 --> 03:41:25.360
Commission on Charter Schools,

California Practitioners Advisory Group,

03:41:27.360 --> 03:41:29.360
and the Instructional Quality

03:41:29.360 --> 03:41:31.360
Commission.

03:41:31.360 --> 03:41:33.360
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond,

03:41:33.360 --> 03:41:35.360
and I would like to extend my

03:41:35.360 --> 03:41:37.360
thanks to members

03:41:37.360 --> 03:41:39.360
Lewis and Escobedo for their time

03:41:39.360 --> 03:41:41.360
and commitment to this process,

03:41:41.360 --> 03:41:43.360
as well as to the CDE

03:41:43.360 --> 03:41:45.360
and State Board of Education staff.

03:41:45.360 --> 03:41:47.360
We had quite an opportunity to

03:41:47.360 --> 03:41:49.360
meet and interview quite a number

03:41:49.360 --> 03:41:51.360
of candidates for the various commissions.

03:41:51.360 --> 03:41:53.360
A request for the applications

03:41:53.360 --> 03:41:55.360
for new members to

03:41:55.360 --> 03:41:57.360
the Instructional Quality Commission,

03:41:57.360 --> 03:41:59.360
also known as the IQC, the

03:41:59.360 --> 03:42:01.360
Advisory Commission on Charter Schools,

03:42:01.360 --> 03:42:03.360
and the California Practitioners

03:42:03.360 --> 03:42:05.360
Advisory Group began in August.

03:42:05.360 --> 03:42:07.360
The

03:42:07.360 --> 03:42:09.360
screening committee, so I'm going to start first with

03:42:09.360 --> 03:42:11.360
the IQC or Instructional Quality

03:42:11.360 --> 03:42:13.360
Commission

03:42:13.360 --> 03:42:15.360
recommendations from the screening committee.

03:42:15.360 --> 03:42:17.360
The screening committee selected

03:42:17.360 --> 03:42:19.360
the following candidates

03:42:19.360 --> 03:42:21.360
for the IQC for a

03:42:21.360 --> 03:42:23.360
three-year term beginning January

03:42:23.360 --> 03:42:25.360
1, 2023,

03:42:25.360 --> 03:42:27.360
through December

03:42:27.360 --> 03:42:29.360
31, 2026.

03:46:33.360 --> 03:46:35.360
you on your respective commissions

03:46:35.360 --> 03:46:37.360
and committees.

03:46:37.360 --> 03:46:39.360
And I just need a point of

03:46:39.360 --> 03:46:41.360
clarification. Do we need to bring a motion

03:46:41.360 --> 03:46:43.360
forward for these or are they just

03:46:43.360 --> 03:46:45.360
accepted as read?

03:46:45.360 --> 03:46:47.360
I have a motion.

03:46:47.360 --> 03:46:49.360
Okay.

03:46:49.360 --> 03:46:51.360
All of them at once

03:46:51.360 --> 03:46:53.360
is the way that it goes.

03:46:53.360 --> 03:46:55.360
You don't want it individually.

03:46:55.360 --> 03:46:57.360
One motion.

03:46:57.360 --> 03:46:59.360
One motion.

03:46:59.360 --> 03:47:01.360
So I move that we

03:47:01.360 --> 03:47:03.360
approve and accept all

03:47:03.360 --> 03:47:05.360
of those. We have to have public comment

03:47:05.360 --> 03:47:07.360
first. Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you.

03:47:07.360 --> 03:47:09.360
Okay. That's all right.

03:47:09.360 --> 03:47:11.360
And so I don't know if

03:47:11.360 --> 03:47:13.360
member Lewis or member

03:47:13.360 --> 03:47:15.360
Escobedo wants to add anything and we

03:47:15.360 --> 03:47:17.360
appreciate their participation on the committee.

03:47:19.360 --> 03:47:21.360
All I would like

03:47:21.360 --> 03:47:23.360
to add is just to

03:47:23.360 --> 03:47:25.360
commend Dr.

03:47:25.360 --> 03:47:27.360
Cynthia Glover Woods for her

03:47:27.360 --> 03:47:29.360
amazing grace and

03:47:29.360 --> 03:47:31.360
organization

03:47:31.360 --> 03:47:33.360
in performing these

03:47:33.360 --> 03:47:35.360
interviews. It was

03:47:35.360 --> 03:47:37.360
such an amazing

03:47:37.360 --> 03:47:39.360
opportunity for

03:47:39.360 --> 03:47:41.360
us to see

03:47:41.360 --> 03:47:43.360
herculean effort reviewing

03:47:43.360 --> 03:47:45.360
their extensive background

03:47:45.360 --> 03:47:47.360
and interviewing.

03:47:47.360 --> 03:47:49.360
We had so many great

03:47:49.360 --> 03:47:51.360
candidates throughout California.

03:47:51.360 --> 03:47:53.360
But I just wanted to commend

03:47:53.360 --> 03:47:55.360
our vice president

03:47:55.360 --> 03:47:57.360
for such an amazing job.

03:47:57.360 --> 03:47:59.360
Thank you.

03:47:59.360 --> 03:48:01.360
And I would just like to

03:48:01.360 --> 03:48:03.360
echo those comments.

03:48:03.360 --> 03:48:05.360
We had a very smooth

03:48:05.360 --> 03:48:07.360
process, very smoothly.

03:48:07.360 --> 03:48:09.360
A smooth process, an enjoyable process.

03:48:09.360 --> 03:48:11.360
We did have a lot of great

03:48:11.360 --> 03:48:13.360
candidates and it was just a pleasure

03:48:13.360 --> 03:48:15.360
to meet all of the candidates

03:48:15.360 --> 03:48:17.360
and just congratulate

03:48:17.360 --> 03:48:19.360
them on moving forward.

03:48:19.360 --> 03:48:21.360
Thank you so much. Are there

03:48:21.360 --> 03:48:23.360
any public comments?

03:48:23.360 --> 03:48:25.360
We do not have any callers on the

03:48:25.360 --> 03:48:27.360
queue for public comment.

03:48:27.360 --> 03:48:29.360
All right. Great.

03:48:29.360 --> 03:48:31.360
So now can I have a motion?

03:48:33.360 --> 03:48:35.360
I move to approve the

03:48:35.360 --> 03:48:37.360
callers'

03:48:37.360 --> 03:48:39.360
appointments as

03:48:39.360 --> 03:48:41.360
read and shared to

03:48:41.360 --> 03:48:43.360
the various commissions,

03:48:43.360 --> 03:48:45.360
IQC, ACCS, and the

03:48:45.360 --> 03:48:47.360

03:48:47.360 --> 03:48:49.360
Terrific. Is there a second?

03:48:49.360 --> 03:48:51.360
Second.

03:48:51.360 --> 03:48:53.360
Thank you very much.

03:48:53.360 --> 03:48:55.360

03:48:55.360 --> 03:48:57.360
President Darling-Hammond.

03:48:57.360 --> 03:48:59.360
Aye.

03:48:59.360 --> 03:49:01.360
Member Escobedo.

03:49:01.360 --> 03:49:02.360
Yes.

03:49:02.360 --> 03:49:03.360
Yes.

03:49:03.360 --> 03:49:04.360
Yes.

03:49:04.360 --> 03:49:05.360
Yes.

03:49:05.360 --> 03:49:06.360
Yes.

03:49:06.360 --> 03:49:07.360
Yes.

03:49:07.360 --> 03:49:08.360
Yes.

03:49:08.360 --> 03:49:09.360
Yes.

03:49:09.360 --> 03:49:10.360
Yes.

03:49:10.360 --> 03:49:11.360
Yes.

03:49:11.360 --> 03:49:12.360
Yes.

03:49:12.360 --> 03:49:13.360
Yes.

03:49:13.360 --> 03:49:14.360
Yes.

03:49:14.360 --> 03:49:15.360
Yes.

03:49:15.360 --> 03:49:16.360

03:49:20.740 --> 03:49:21.740

03:49:21.740 --> 03:49:26.580
The motion carries unanimously.

03:49:26.580 --> 03:49:29.240
Terrific, thank you.

03:49:29.240 --> 03:49:34.020
I do want to invite our Board members to report on their liaison activities that were not

03:49:34.020 --> 03:49:37.520
related to items on our September agenda.

03:49:37.520 --> 03:49:42.160
I also know there are some people who have had luncheon obligations they are looking

03:49:42.160 --> 03:49:44.120
to fulfill.

03:49:44.120 --> 03:49:51.880
And so I will urge us to get to the high points maybe in about a minute each of our liaison

03:49:51.880 --> 03:49:57.880
reports so that folks can be only a little bit late for their appointments.

03:49:57.880 --> 03:50:01.720
So I'm going to start with member Escobedo.

03:50:01.720 --> 03:50:05.000
Yes, very quick.

03:50:05.000 --> 03:50:11.460
Last week I went to the NASB conference and presented on behalf of San Diego State but

03:50:11.460 --> 03:50:18.660
also obviously was there presenting, you know, the state of California on partnerships with

03:50:18.660 --> 03:50:21.940
universities and districts.

03:50:21.940 --> 03:50:27.220
And I just want to let you know, talking about accountability, how many state representatives

03:50:27.220 --> 03:50:31.340
came up to me and asked me questions about the dashboard.

03:50:31.340 --> 03:50:38.700
Most of the states use a single indicator and they are fascinated with what we in California

03:50:38.700 --> 03:50:40.340
have constructed.

03:50:40.340 --> 03:50:41.340
So that was great.

03:50:41.340 --> 03:50:51.780
I also attended a school with Superintendent Thurman this month, community schools who

03:50:51.780 --> 03:50:58.780
won, they earned the implementation grant at Vista district.

03:50:58.780 --> 03:51:07.060
And it was just great to see the beginnings, well, and further improvements on their community

03:51:07.060 --> 03:51:08.940
schools' focus.

03:51:08.940 --> 03:51:12.420
So that was great to see it in action.

03:51:12.420 --> 03:51:13.420
Thank you.

03:51:13.420 --> 03:51:14.420
Terrific.

03:51:14.420 --> 03:51:16.780
And excellent modeling.

03:51:16.780 --> 03:51:19.340
Vice President Glover-Woods.

03:51:19.340 --> 03:51:21.820
I have nothing more to add, President Darley-Hammond.

03:51:21.820 --> 03:51:27.060
All right, member Lewis.

03:51:27.060 --> 03:51:33.820
No committee liaison report since last month, but I will say that I was able to attend the

03:51:34.660 --> 03:51:40.020
Kern County Superintendent of Schools' equity summit and participate on a panel discussion

03:51:40.020 --> 03:51:43.260
about putting equitable practices in action.

03:51:43.260 --> 03:51:48.820
And it was all about students choosing to see and the power of equity in education.

03:51:48.820 --> 03:51:52.660
So it was very enjoyable.

03:51:52.660 --> 03:51:53.660
Member McQuillan.

03:51:53.660 --> 03:51:59.300
Yes, lunch is calling, so I'll be brief.

03:51:59.300 --> 03:52:04.900
We're waiting for a new date on the Joint Pathways on Career Technical Education.

03:52:04.900 --> 03:52:12.220
We had to postpone our date this month due to trouble finding a date that works for everyone,

03:52:12.220 --> 03:52:15.500
but looking forward to that meeting.

03:52:15.500 --> 03:52:20.180
I want to tell everybody this is American Indian Heritage Month that starts here in

03:52:20.180 --> 03:52:23.540
November, so keeping that in mind.

03:52:23.540 --> 03:52:33.060
There are some wonderful model lessons in the Ethnic Studies curriculum that we passed

03:52:33.060 --> 03:52:39.260
way back in March 2021, but reminding people there are three really good lessons in there

03:52:39.260 --> 03:52:44.140
that could be tried out, so hoping to see that.

03:52:44.140 --> 03:52:45.980
So thank you.

03:52:45.980 --> 03:52:46.980
Terrific.

03:52:46.980 --> 03:52:50.900
Thank you for that very timely reminder.

03:52:50.900 --> 03:52:51.900
Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

03:52:52.260 --> 03:52:54.260
Oh, I'm sorry, Member Olken.

03:52:54.260 --> 03:52:58.260
I'm going to be completely alphabetical here.

03:52:58.260 --> 03:53:00.260
Hello.

03:53:00.260 --> 03:53:04.020
I am the liaison to two different commissions.

03:53:04.020 --> 03:53:10.460
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools didn't meet this in October, so no need to

03:53:10.460 --> 03:53:11.540
report on that.

03:53:11.540 --> 03:53:17.100
And then also I'm the liaison for the Advisory Commission on Special Education.

03:53:17.300 --> 03:53:23.300
And just to be super brief, I think the most exciting thing that happened at the Advisory

03:53:23.300 --> 03:53:30.900
Commission on Special Education is Senate Bill 291 passed, which increases the size

03:53:30.900 --> 03:53:36.300
of the commission by two, by adding two student members to the commission.

03:53:36.300 --> 03:53:43.740
And so the, we spent a bit of time thinking about how the commission would rethink its

03:53:43.820 --> 03:53:53.220
work to ensure that we can get the most input and leverage from having some students on

03:53:53.220 --> 03:53:54.220
the commission.

03:53:54.220 --> 03:53:57.340
And I think everyone's really excited about that.

03:53:57.340 --> 03:54:05.300
And those two students will be students, the requirement is between 16 and 22 years of

03:54:05.300 --> 03:54:09.540
age with exceptional needs.

03:54:09.540 --> 03:54:14.940
So I think that's a really great advancement for that commission.

03:54:14.940 --> 03:54:15.940
And that's the end of my report.

03:54:15.940 --> 03:54:16.940
Terrific.

03:54:16.940 --> 03:54:19.700
What a good announcement.

03:54:19.700 --> 03:54:20.700
Member Roscoe Gonzales.

03:54:20.700 --> 03:54:27.580
Well, I had the assessment mega items, so I think we've covered those extensively.

03:54:27.580 --> 03:54:32.940
I just want to remind all the educators and community members that collaboration is the

03:54:32.940 --> 03:54:39.100
key for student success and to continue that spirit of collaboration, because when we work

03:54:39.100 --> 03:54:42.900
together, we create a better learning experience for our students.

03:54:42.900 --> 03:54:47.420
So I just want to repeat that because I think that that will be the key going forward and

03:54:47.420 --> 03:54:51.180
into embarking next year as we create student goals.

03:54:51.180 --> 03:54:52.180
Terrific.

03:54:52.180 --> 03:54:53.180
Thank you.

03:54:53.180 --> 03:54:54.180
Member Petillo-Bronson.

03:54:54.180 --> 03:54:55.180
Good afternoon.

03:54:55.180 --> 03:55:01.780
And there's a couple of updates I'll share.

03:55:01.780 --> 03:55:07.940
One is that the Department of Education has launched its UPK communications materials

03:55:08.780 --> 03:55:15.100
which is really focused on making sure that school districts and community partners are

03:55:15.100 --> 03:55:21.020
aware of some of the new state-funded services, funding streams, and also that there's outreach

03:55:21.020 --> 03:55:26.700
to families so that they can avail themselves of both the expansion of universal pre-K for

03:55:26.700 --> 03:55:32.700
threes as well as universal TK, transitional kindergarten, for fours.

03:55:33.180 --> 03:55:38.300
I was also delighted to be able to share some of these more recent developments with the

03:55:38.300 --> 03:55:46.300
NASB Early Learning Group online, and it is exciting to actually see that some of our

03:55:46.300 --> 03:55:51.300
work is certainly, I think, attracting the attention of some of our state peers and other

03:55:51.300 --> 03:55:56.700
geographies, and that there's also parallel shifts, I think, happening in other states

03:55:56.700 --> 03:55:58.820
around the P2-3 continuum.

03:55:59.820 --> 03:56:06.820
Lastly, I'll just flag that the Department of Social Services, which is sometimes a sort

03:56:06.820 --> 03:56:14.820
of corresponding agency that certainly works with many of the same folks who we are focusing

03:56:14.820 --> 03:56:20.220
on in terms of children and families, put forward its rate reform recommendations to

03:56:20.220 --> 03:56:25.820
the early childhood workforce, particularly looking at 0-3, but also aftercare for children

03:56:25.820 --> 03:56:26.820
0-12.

03:56:26.820 --> 03:56:30.820
And so we are, I think, eagerly awaiting sort of to see where that moves.

03:56:31.820 --> 03:56:38.820
And actually, the last thing I'll flag is a PPIC study that just came out, which I think

03:56:38.820 --> 03:56:42.820
really connects to our conversation about community schools and the environments in

03:56:42.820 --> 03:56:51.820
which children live, really celebrating what California has done and really prevented in

03:56:51.820 --> 03:56:58.820
terms of child poverty, looking at the child poverty rates, which dramatically fell from

03:56:58.820 --> 03:57:04.820
about 18% in 2019 to 9% in 2021.

03:57:04.820 --> 03:57:12.820
And all of those children being both in the 0-5 space, the feeder pattern into the K-12

03:57:12.820 --> 03:57:18.820
system, and many of those children being the 5-17 range, being able to have the wraparound

03:57:18.820 --> 03:57:22.820
supports that enable them to show up into schools and be ready to learn.

03:57:22.820 --> 03:57:29.820
So those wins, I think, largely were attributed to CalFresh and the EITC and Young

03:57:29.820 --> 03:57:35.820
Child Tax Credit and just acknowledging the connection between all of our systems as we

03:57:35.820 --> 03:57:38.820
continue to build out the whole child system of support.

03:57:38.820 --> 03:57:45.820
Yeah, and that shift in poverty was both California-funded and federal ARPA funds, the

03:57:45.820 --> 03:57:48.820
federal ARPA funds accounted for some of that.

03:57:48.820 --> 03:57:50.820
You're much more generous to acknowledge the feds.

03:57:50.820 --> 03:57:57.820
Well, and when that ended, because Build Back Better was not enacted, the poverty rates

03:57:57.820 --> 03:58:02.820
nationally have gone back up a bit, so we've got more work to do, but we should celebrate

03:58:02.820 --> 03:58:03.820
our successes.

03:58:03.820 --> 03:58:06.820
Student Member Porter, your report.

03:58:06.820 --> 03:58:07.820
Absolutely.

03:58:07.820 --> 03:58:08.820
I'll keep it brief.

03:58:08.820 --> 03:58:11.820
So in addition to being at the SAIP conference, I also attended two other student advocacy

03:58:11.820 --> 03:58:12.820
conferences.

03:58:12.820 --> 03:58:17.820
The first was in person at Portola High School, where I gave feedback along with Dr. Woods.

03:58:17.820 --> 03:58:19.820
We actually got to be in person, which was very fun.

03:58:19.820 --> 03:58:25.820
We gave feedback on six student proposals on financial literacy, socioeconomic inequalities

03:58:25.820 --> 03:58:27.820
and sustainability in schools.

03:58:27.820 --> 03:58:33.820
And I also gave a presentation to about 50 San Benito district students about student

03:58:33.820 --> 03:58:38.820
voice on the local and statewide level and encouraging students to get involved, giving

03:58:38.820 --> 03:58:44.820
public comment at local board meetings, creating clubs on civic advocacy, and talking to district

03:58:44.820 --> 03:58:46.820
staff because they are the contextualized local agents.

03:58:46.820 --> 03:58:50.820
And so that is what I've been up to, and I look forward to continuing to hear student

03:58:50.820 --> 03:58:52.820
voice these next few months.

03:58:52.820 --> 03:58:54.820
That's great, and it's expanding.

03:58:54.820 --> 03:58:56.820
I love it.

03:58:56.820 --> 03:58:58.820
Member Rodriguez.

03:58:58.820 --> 03:58:59.820
Thank you.

03:58:59.820 --> 03:59:03.820
Good afternoon, board members and members of the public, including educators, students

03:59:03.820 --> 03:59:04.820
and families.

03:59:04.820 --> 03:59:10.820
Since we last met, the Commission on Teacher Credentialing has moved important work in

03:59:10.820 --> 03:59:14.820
the areas of literacy, early childhood credentialing, and teacher data.

03:59:14.820 --> 03:59:20.820
In literacy, the commission adopted standards and teaching performing expectations, TPEs,

03:59:20.820 --> 03:59:26.820
to ensure teachers, including early childhood educators, are prepared to teach foundational

03:59:26.820 --> 03:59:27.820
literacy.

03:59:27.820 --> 03:59:32.820
I can hear you smiling through the Zoom.

03:59:32.820 --> 03:59:37.820
It approved a mandate that all multiple-subject, single-subject, and education specialist

03:59:37.820 --> 03:59:46.820
credentials must transition to the new standards by July 2024, and all new PK3EC credentials

03:59:46.820 --> 03:59:52.820
must demonstrate alignment to the newly adopted literacy standards and performance expectations

03:59:52.820 --> 03:59:53.820
in 2023.

03:59:53.820 --> 03:59:59.820
As we all know, the way we prepare teachers is a critical step to ensure all students

03:59:59.820 --> 04:00:01.820
learn to read and love to read.

04:00:01.820 --> 04:00:08.820
In early childhood, the commission also adopted program preconditions, program standards,

04:00:08.820 --> 04:00:15.820
and teaching performance expectations for the PK through three early childhood education

04:00:15.820 --> 04:00:17.820
specialist instruction credentials.

04:00:17.820 --> 04:00:23.820
This work is responsive to the state's master plan for early learning and care and will

04:00:23.820 --> 04:00:28.820
be critical to staffing the state's commitment to universal transitional kindergarten.

04:00:28.820 --> 04:00:34.820
In the area of teacher data, the commission approved a report to the legislature on the

04:00:34.820 --> 04:00:39.820
early implementation of the California statewide assignment accountability system with the

04:00:39.820 --> 04:00:46.820
CDE, which the CDE leveraged to publish the first-ever school site-level assignment monitoring

04:00:46.820 --> 04:00:49.820
outcome data on DataQuest earlier this year.

04:00:49.820 --> 04:00:56.820
Finally, the commission also approved a passing standard for the California education specialist,

04:00:56.820 --> 04:00:58.820
NTPA, performance assessment.

04:00:58.820 --> 04:01:04.820
Taken together, these reflect the commission's critical work to ensure that California teacher

04:01:04.820 --> 04:01:10.820
candidates have the highest level of education, preparation, and training to meet the ever-changing

04:01:10.820 --> 04:01:12.820
needs of all students.

04:01:12.820 --> 04:01:19.820
So that was finally on the commission, but that is a great segue to talk a little bit

04:01:19.820 --> 04:01:26.820
about the Yidan Prize, which supports changemakers in education to unlock a better future for

04:01:26.820 --> 04:01:28.820
all learners.

04:01:28.820 --> 04:01:36.820
And it is the most prestigious prize in education, and we happen to have Yidan Laureate, recipient

04:01:36.820 --> 04:01:42.820
of the prize this year, among us, and I'd like to congratulate President Linda Darling-Hammond.

04:01:42.820 --> 04:01:44.820
So well deserved.

04:01:44.820 --> 04:01:46.820
Thank you.

04:01:46.820 --> 04:01:49.820
Thank you very much, Member Rodriguez.

04:01:49.820 --> 04:01:52.820
Member Yoshimoto-Tari.

04:01:52.820 --> 04:01:54.820
Thank you.

04:01:54.820 --> 04:01:59.820
So while this is my second meeting and we're finalizing my official liaison assignments, I just

04:01:59.820 --> 04:02:04.820
wanted to say I'm looking forward to joining our colleagues at the Sacramento County and Los Angeles

04:02:04.820 --> 04:02:11.820
County Offices of Education at the California Civic Learning Summit on November 15th, hosted by

04:02:11.820 --> 04:02:13.820
the Californians for Civic Learning.

04:02:13.820 --> 04:02:16.820
And this is in collaboration with the Power for Democracy Steering Committee.

04:02:16.820 --> 04:02:22.820
And then in December, I look forward to being with our attending our California School Boards

04:02:22.820 --> 04:02:25.820
Association End of Conference in San Diego.

04:02:25.820 --> 04:02:26.820
Thank you.

04:02:26.820 --> 04:02:27.820
Terrific.

04:02:27.820 --> 04:02:34.820
And I will just add in relation to our linkage to the California Commission for Excellence in

04:02:34.820 --> 04:02:41.820
Education, the CCEE, that they have launched the Learning Acceleration System Grant, which allows

04:02:41.820 --> 04:02:46.820
for state funding to be used for a statewide professional learning infrastructure to support

04:02:46.820 --> 04:02:51.820
professional development in math, ELA, and English language development.

04:02:51.820 --> 04:02:58.820
For learning acceleration, this is being led by Santa Clara County Office of Education, San

04:02:58.820 --> 04:03:07.820
Diego County Office of Education, and Lake County, County Office of Education, for English

04:03:08.820 --> 04:03:12.820
language arts, and there's also a rural math collaborative.

04:03:12.820 --> 04:03:17.820
They're developing professional learning modules covering evidence-based strategies and math

04:03:17.820 --> 04:03:22.820
literacy and language development that will be free and accessible to educators across the state

04:03:22.820 --> 04:03:28.820
once they're finalized in early 2023, and they held orientation meetings for their online

04:03:28.820 --> 04:03:30.820
course writers.

04:03:30.820 --> 04:03:35.820
Every module will include guidance on integrating universal design for learning, social-emotional

04:03:35.820 --> 04:03:41.820
learning, and culturally sustaining pedagogy with classroom instruction for acceleration.

04:03:41.820 --> 04:03:45.820
So that's an exciting process that's underway.

04:03:45.820 --> 04:03:50.820
They're also hosting, they did host a Learning Acceleration System Grant professional learning

04:03:50.820 --> 04:03:57.820
network meeting, and that will be continuing quarterly to help coordinate the efforts that

04:03:57.820 --> 04:04:01.820
county offices and districts are undertaking.

04:04:01.820 --> 04:04:06.820
And the rural math collaborative launched as well with its inaugural professional learning

04:04:06.820 --> 04:04:09.820
series with the California math project.

04:04:09.820 --> 04:04:14.820
So there's a lot going on in the state to pick up on the themes that we talked about during this

04:04:14.820 --> 04:04:21.820
meeting for really wrapping around our students academically and in every other way to promote

04:04:21.820 --> 04:04:23.820
accelerated learning.

04:04:23.820 --> 04:04:30.820
And with that, I think we are at a point where we can adjourn the November 2022 meeting of the

04:04:30.820 --> 04:04:33.820
State Board of Education at 1 10 p.m.

04:04:33.820 --> 04:04:41.820
I wish everyone a good weekend, and those who are rushing off to lunch, a very good lunch.

04:04:41.820 --> 04:04:43.820
Take care.

04:04:43.820 --> 04:04:45.820
Thank you all.
