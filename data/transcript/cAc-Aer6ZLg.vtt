WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.840
So will you please call the roll to establish a quorum?

00:05.840 --> 00:08.540
Member Burr.

00:08.540 --> 00:09.540
President Darling-Hammond.

00:09.540 --> 00:10.540
Here.

00:10.540 --> 00:11.540
Member Patel.

00:11.540 --> 00:12.540
Here.

00:12.540 --> 00:13.540
Member Glover-Woods.

00:13.540 --> 00:14.540
Here.

00:14.540 --> 00:15.540
Member McQuillan.

00:15.540 --> 00:16.540
Here.

00:16.540 --> 00:17.540
Member Navo.

00:17.540 --> 00:18.540
Here.

00:18.540 --> 00:19.540
Member Patil-Brownson.

00:19.540 --> 00:20.540
Here.

00:20.540 --> 00:21.540
Member Rodriguez.

00:21.540 --> 00:22.540
Here.

00:22.540 --> 00:23.540
Member Williams.

00:23.540 --> 00:24.540
Here.

00:24.780 --> 00:25.780
Member Strauss.

00:25.780 --> 00:26.780
Here.

00:26.780 --> 00:27.780
Member Son.

00:27.780 --> 00:28.780
Here.

00:28.780 --> 00:47.680
All right, I hereby call the November 2020 meeting of the State Board of Education to

00:47.680 --> 00:51.340
order at 8.33 a.m.

00:51.340 --> 00:54.260
And I'd like to commence by saluting the flag.

00:54.260 --> 00:57.900
Member I.D. Rodriguez, will you please lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance?

00:57.900 --> 00:58.900
Absolutely.

00:58.900 --> 01:03.900
Please stand.

01:03.900 --> 01:06.660
And ready, begin.

01:06.660 --> 01:14.860
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for

01:14.860 --> 01:30.180
which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, for liberty and justice for all.

01:30.180 --> 01:32.860
Very poignant words in this week of voting.

01:32.860 --> 01:39.100
This is a big week for civic engagement, and I'm sure we'll have a lot of opportunities

01:39.100 --> 01:41.500
to reflect on that.

01:41.500 --> 01:42.500
Thank you.

01:43.140 --> 01:44.620
I'm going to start with announcements.

01:44.620 --> 01:50.260
I'm delighted to announce that Rigel Massaro has joined the SBE team last week.

01:50.260 --> 01:55.020
She had worked as a senior legislative counsel of public advocates since 2013.

01:55.020 --> 02:01.380
Prior to that, she was a staff attorney for Advocates for Children of New York, Inc.,

02:01.380 --> 02:08.700
a law clerk for the Arizona Court of Appeals, a law clerk at Consumers Union, and an educator

02:08.780 --> 02:12.540
in the Littleton Elementary School District in Cashin, Arizona.

02:12.540 --> 02:15.780
And please join me in welcoming Rigel.

02:15.780 --> 02:21.340
Are we able to put Rigel on the screen?

02:21.340 --> 02:22.340
Maybe not.

02:22.340 --> 02:25.460
We'll have to probably see her a little bit later.

02:25.460 --> 02:27.740
She's going to be a great addition.

02:27.740 --> 02:34.420
And many of us know her from her work in Sacramento on issues that we care about, so she'll be

02:34.420 --> 02:36.580
picking right up.

02:36.620 --> 02:40.020
There are four items on the agenda that have agenda.

02:40.020 --> 02:45.100
Item one, the SBE Screening Committee recommendations for appointments to the Advisory Commission

02:45.100 --> 02:50.580
on Charter Schools, the Advisory Commission on Special Education, the California Practitioners

02:50.580 --> 02:54.860
Advisory Group, and the Instructional Quality Commission.

02:54.860 --> 03:01.500
Item two is the SBE Screening Committee recommendations for three finalists for the 2021-22 Student

03:01.500 --> 03:03.100
Board Member.

03:03.140 --> 03:08.100
Item three, the 2020 Student Advisory Board on Education Report.

03:08.100 --> 03:13.340
Item four, Approval of the Criteria to Define Verified Data and the List of Valid and Reliable

03:13.340 --> 03:18.300
Assessments and Measures of Post-Secondary Outcomes as Required by California Education

03:18.300 --> 03:23.140
Code Section 47607.2.

03:23.140 --> 03:33.060
On consent calendars, the proposed waiver consent items are W01 through W06 and W08.

03:33.060 --> 03:39.020
The proposed regular consent items are items six through eight and item 11.

03:39.020 --> 03:45.660
We will take up both the waiver consent items and the regular consent items later this afternoon.

03:45.660 --> 03:51.380
In terms of public input, members of the public who are wishing to call in for public comment

03:51.380 --> 03:55.740
should view the live stream of the meeting to know what time public comment will occur

03:55.740 --> 03:58.300
for each item.

03:58.340 --> 04:02.220
Public comment may be provided by dialing the phone number, entering a participant access

04:02.220 --> 04:06.780
code, and then following each of the operator's prompts.

04:06.780 --> 04:10.340
Upon dialing in, callers will be added to a caller queue.

04:10.340 --> 04:14.220
The operator will notify callers when it is their turn to provide public comment.

04:14.220 --> 04:19.740
We will also ask callers to please turn down the speaker volume of their computers if they

04:19.740 --> 04:24.540
are following the live webcast to avoid an echoing effect.

04:24.580 --> 04:28.660
Public comment will be limited to one minute for each speaker.

04:28.660 --> 04:33.420
Item 12 is the general public comment item during which members of the public may provide

04:33.420 --> 04:38.220
comment on matters that are not specifically listed on the Board agenda.

04:38.220 --> 04:41.940
Board members, please mute your microphones when you're not speaking and keep your cameras

04:41.940 --> 04:47.180
on at all times except during scheduled breaks to ensure that we maintain a quorum throughout

04:47.180 --> 04:49.300
today's virtual meeting.

04:49.300 --> 04:53.580
And for each item on the agenda, there will be an opportunity for you Board members to

04:53.620 --> 04:57.100
raise your hands using the Zoom participant window.

04:57.100 --> 05:01.780
If you would like to ask a question or make a comment, and Brooks will help me keep track

05:01.780 --> 05:02.780
of that.

05:02.780 --> 05:07.060
So, we're going to start with agenda item one.

05:07.060 --> 05:14.220
First, I'm going to welcome Patricia Rucker, who has just arrived, welcome Pat.

05:14.220 --> 05:23.420
So our State Board priorities item, the State Superintendent would be giving his report

05:53.420 --> 06:16.380
to the Board of Regents and the Board of Regents and the Board of Regents and the Board of

06:16.380 --> 06:17.380
Regents.

06:17.380 --> 06:18.380
I'm back.

06:18.380 --> 06:19.380
Hopefully, there we go.

06:19.380 --> 06:20.380
Can you see me?

06:20.380 --> 06:21.380
Give me a thumbs up.

06:21.380 --> 06:22.380
All right.

06:22.380 --> 06:23.380
Thanks.

06:24.340 --> 06:25.340
Thank you.

06:25.340 --> 06:26.340
I'm going to turn it over to Patricia.

06:26.340 --> 06:27.340
I'm going to turn it over to Patricia.

06:27.340 --> 06:28.340
I'm going to turn it over to Patricia.

06:28.340 --> 06:29.340
I'm going to turn it over to Patricia.

06:29.340 --> 06:30.340
I'm going to turn it over to Patricia.

06:30.340 --> 06:31.340
I'm going to turn it over to Patricia.

06:31.340 --> 06:32.340
I'm going to turn it over to Patricia.

06:32.340 --> 06:33.340
I'm going to turn it over to Patricia.

06:33.340 --> 06:34.340
I'm going to turn it over to Patricia.

06:34.340 --> 06:35.340
I'm going to turn it over to Patricia.

06:35.340 --> 06:36.340
I'm going to turn it over to Patricia.

06:36.340 --> 06:37.340
I'm going to turn it over to Patricia.

06:37.340 --> 06:38.340
I'm going to turn it over to Patricia.

06:38.340 --> 06:39.340
I'm going to turn it over to Patricia.

06:39.340 --> 06:40.340
I'm going to turn it over to Patricia.

06:40.340 --> 06:41.340
I'm going to turn it over to Patricia.

06:41.340 --> 06:42.340
I'm going to turn it over to Patricia.

06:42.340 --> 06:43.340
I'm going to turn it over to Patricia.

06:43.340 --> 06:44.340
I'm going to turn it over to Patricia.

06:44.340 --> 06:45.340
I'm going to turn it over to Patricia.

06:45.340 --> 06:46.340
I'm going to turn it over to Patricia.

06:46.340 --> 06:47.340
I'm going to turn it over to Patricia.

06:47.340 --> 06:48.340
I'm going to turn it over to Patricia.

06:48.340 --> 06:49.340
I'm going to turn it over to Patricia.

06:49.340 --> 06:50.340
I'm going to turn it over to Patricia.

06:50.340 --> 06:51.340
I'm going to turn it over to Patricia.

06:51.340 --> 06:53.540
that as well in California.

06:53.540 --> 06:59.700
As we've seen this week, 160 million Americans determinedly voted across this country more

06:59.700 --> 07:02.100
than ever before in our history.

07:02.100 --> 07:08.540
It is a time for civic engagement around these issues and around other issues as well to

07:08.540 --> 07:22.180
guide the course of our country and our state and to ensure that we can live together and

07:22.180 --> 07:30.420
appreciate each other safely and productively at our November meeting last with ravaged

07:30.420 --> 07:33.900
communities in Butte County and in Ventura County.

07:33.900 --> 07:38.500
I'm hoping my internet will hold.

07:38.500 --> 07:44.020
Last November, we honored students and teachers for schools for climate action, a Sonoma County

07:44.020 --> 07:50.180
organization formed after the pubs fire in 2017 to enable students to advocate for climate

07:50.180 --> 07:51.500
solutions.

07:51.500 --> 07:56.780
We thank them for their advocacy, which has resulted in more than 100 educational organizations

07:56.780 --> 07:59.740
adopting climate change resolutions.

07:59.740 --> 08:04.860
At that time, we noted that six of the 10 most destructive fires in California's history

08:04.900 --> 08:08.420
had occurred since October 2017.

08:08.420 --> 08:14.580
A year later, we have experienced the worst wildfire season in our state history.

08:14.580 --> 08:19.980
Over 9,000 fires burned 4.3 million acres of our state this year.

08:19.980 --> 08:25.260
A year ago, I noted that California, that climate change is not only an existential threat,

08:25.260 --> 08:30.100
it's a threat to our ability to provide a safe and healthy learning environment for students.

08:30.100 --> 08:33.420
And it is something that we can address.

08:33.460 --> 08:39.020
Recently, I was asked to join the National K-12 Action Climate Action Commission.

08:39.020 --> 08:44.260
It's an initiative the Aspen Institute has an impressive list of partners, the National

08:44.260 --> 08:49.460
Education Association, the American Federation of Teachers, the PTA, the Education Trust,

08:49.460 --> 08:51.740
the Sierra Club, and many others.

08:51.740 --> 08:56.340
And that commission issued a report examining how states and districts can adopt policies

08:56.340 --> 09:02.300
to help America's 98,000 public schools reduce energy, reduce bus emissions, and reduce food

09:02.300 --> 09:04.460
waste.

09:04.460 --> 09:09.420
I hadn't realized, and probably many others don't know, that schools are among the largest

09:09.420 --> 09:14.060
energy consumers among public sector buildings.

09:14.060 --> 09:18.820
Schools serve over 7 billion meals annually with related food waste.

09:18.820 --> 09:24.900
Schools use about 480,000 school buses for transportation, the largest mass transit fleet

09:24.900 --> 09:26.420
in the country.

09:26.420 --> 09:30.580
And the report highlighted local districts that have policies to support sustainable

09:30.620 --> 09:34.500
practices that can be replicated statewide.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.820
Many California districts were highlighted.

09:36.820 --> 09:42.100
Los Angeles Unified, the nation's second largest district, made progress on its commitment

09:42.100 --> 09:46.460
to reach 100% clean renewable energy by 2040.

09:46.460 --> 09:50.620
The Twin Rivers District in Sacramento was called out as having the largest electric

09:50.620 --> 09:53.460
school bus fleet in the entire nation.

09:53.460 --> 09:58.940
Twin Rivers began converting to electric buses in 2017 using funds from California's

09:58.980 --> 10:00.700
cap and trade program.

10:00.700 --> 10:04.820
The buses have reduced the district's fuel cost by 80%.

10:04.820 --> 10:10.100
Oakland Unified was highlighted for its goal of establishing a garden at every school site

10:10.100 --> 10:13.340
and for its work in food waste reduction.

10:13.340 --> 10:17.860
The district has provided 50% of its waste from reaching a landfill.

10:17.860 --> 10:24.500
These districts are showing that California can confront huge challenges and work to surmount

10:24.500 --> 10:25.580
them.

10:25.580 --> 10:28.220
And we are not shying away from the global challenges.

10:28.380 --> 10:32.700
On climate change, Governor Newsom and the California volunteers announced the creation

10:32.700 --> 10:35.980
of the California Climate Action Corps this summer.

10:35.980 --> 10:38.220
It's just getting started.

10:38.220 --> 10:46.940
But teens and teachers can visit www.climateactioncorps.ca.gov to learn about what is envisioned.

10:46.940 --> 10:51.380
There will be opportunities for high school and college students to spend summers and

10:51.380 --> 10:56.180
extracurricular time engaged in climate volunteering and service activities.

10:56.180 --> 11:01.220
These activities will help students earn the new seal of civic engagement, a recognition

11:01.220 --> 11:06.500
that we want to encourage for all of our students as they and we commit to commuting to supporting

11:06.500 --> 11:08.820
work in our communities.

11:08.820 --> 11:13.500
They can also apply to become Climate Action Corps fellows and those applications are currently

11:13.500 --> 11:14.500
being accepted.

11:14.500 --> 11:17.820
More than 250 fellowships will be awarded.

11:17.820 --> 11:21.580
The state will help to pay for college for these fellows.

11:21.620 --> 11:27.420
They'll be deployed for seven months to a year in frontline communities with various

11:27.420 --> 11:33.380
state and local government committees, nonprofit organizations, universities and colleges developing

11:33.380 --> 11:36.620
and implementing climate action projects.

11:36.620 --> 11:43.140
For our young people, this is part of what they will be living through and with all their

11:43.140 --> 11:51.940
lives and enabling them and us to take more action to preserve and protect the quality

11:51.940 --> 11:55.340
of Californian of their lives is essential.

11:55.340 --> 11:59.820
Of course, it's only one of the many challenges we're facing and I want to talk just a little

11:59.820 --> 12:04.460
bit more about the progress being made in reopening schools, another challenge that

12:04.460 --> 12:08.100
we are meeting and learning to surmount.

12:08.100 --> 12:12.940
Although more than 90% of California students started school and online learning, as the

12:12.940 --> 12:18.340
end of October, there were about three quarters of a million students attending in-person

12:18.340 --> 12:24.140
classes in 21 counties, mostly rural but also suburban orange and San Diego counties.

12:24.140 --> 12:30.780
20 counties have a mix of districts that are open to varying extents in-person and hybrid

12:30.780 --> 12:31.780
learning.

12:31.780 --> 12:37.380
They serve about 1.7 million students and include a mix of urban and semi-urban counties

12:37.380 --> 12:41.020
like Fresno, Sacramento, Ventura, Santa Barbara.

12:41.020 --> 12:45.580
And then in 17 counties where all or most districts are serving students for distance

12:45.580 --> 12:51.100
learning only, there are plans underway for many schools to reopen in January.

12:51.100 --> 12:57.260
These counties serve 3.6 million students and they include L.A., Bay Area, Inland Empire,

12:57.260 --> 12:59.620
Riverside, San Bernardino.

12:59.620 --> 13:05.260
Many creative strategies to finding space and strategies for serving students are being

13:05.260 --> 13:06.260
developed.

13:06.500 --> 13:11.300
For example, partnering with community colleges to use their classrooms while they are in

13:11.300 --> 13:15.780
online learning to create social distancing for high school students.

13:15.780 --> 13:20.180
So there are lots of ways that people are solving the many problems associated with

13:20.180 --> 13:22.880
physical opening of schools.

13:22.880 --> 13:26.860
Many of these districts have brought back students in small groups, often students with

13:26.860 --> 13:30.380
disabilities, English learners, those with other needs.

13:30.380 --> 13:35.420
A number of districts, sometimes working with community partners, have also created learning

13:35.580 --> 13:43.580
hubs to offer spaces for digital learning with adult assistance, with meals, with a

13:43.580 --> 13:49.460
variety of supports for children who are not able to engage in distance learning from home.

13:49.460 --> 13:54.660
We are learning how to open schools safely with appropriate physical distancing, face

13:54.660 --> 13:59.740
coverings, attention to hygiene, attention to creating small cohorts of teachers and

13:59.740 --> 14:03.380
students who stay together throughout the day.

14:04.340 --> 14:07.660
Our Department of Public Health notes that there have been almost no cases of transmission

14:07.660 --> 14:11.500
associated with these school openings thus far.

14:11.500 --> 14:16.900
In addition to the guidance provided by the California Department of Public Health, both

14:16.900 --> 14:21.900
the Department of Education and the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence have

14:21.900 --> 14:27.700
developed guides and toolkits for schools to use when planning how to return to campus.

14:28.020 --> 14:33.660
The state is supporting these efforts by providing two months' worth of free personal protective

14:33.660 --> 14:39.780
equipment to schools at no cost and helping schools procure PPE in bulk and at discounted

14:39.780 --> 14:41.380
rates.

14:41.380 --> 14:48.860
As we know, the Governor's budget this past year, drawing in part on the federal CARES

14:48.860 --> 14:55.060
Act funds, has provided schools with over $5 billion to be spent on closing the digital

14:55.420 --> 15:02.260
divide, sanitation supplies, PPE testing, and then tutoring and other services to address

15:02.260 --> 15:03.660
learning loss.

15:03.660 --> 15:08.260
The state is supporting reopening efforts with new testing partnerships, stepping up

15:08.260 --> 15:14.780
contact tracing efforts, helping with the supply chain, and issuing the guidance.

15:14.780 --> 15:19.500
The state's new contract with Perkin-Elmer, for example, will double the state's COVID

15:19.940 --> 15:26.580
testing capacity and drive down costs and will be made available to many school districts.

15:26.580 --> 15:33.500
We all know that reopening schools is a huge challenge, but we are learning to do it safely.

15:33.500 --> 15:37.980
It is especially important that we get our youngest learners back to school in person

15:37.980 --> 15:42.460
so that they don't use the precious in-person learning needed to learn the fundamental skills

15:42.460 --> 15:46.740
on which they will build the rest of their school careers.

15:46.740 --> 15:55.740
And most countries that have returned to school, as some districts are doing, did so by using

15:55.740 --> 15:59.980
their available space to bring the youngest learners back full-time and then gradually

15:59.980 --> 16:05.700
phasing in older learners as solutions to scheduling and space were worked out.

16:05.700 --> 16:09.620
Because these young students are the most necessary and the safest to bring back in

16:09.620 --> 16:14.340
person, California has offered an elementary school waiver to all districts across the

16:14.340 --> 16:18.900
state, regardless of what tier they're in, and worked out, of course, with the local

16:18.900 --> 16:23.140
public health department to ensure safe procedures.

16:23.140 --> 16:27.180
And I just want to note that California's educators have worked to creatively address

16:27.180 --> 16:29.060
so many challenges this year.

16:29.060 --> 16:35.260
I am optimistic that we'll continue to do so as we meet the many ongoing issues we face

16:35.260 --> 16:40.620
and that we will not just restart schools but reinvent them to be more socially and

16:40.620 --> 16:46.940
emotionally supportive of all students, more relationship-centered, more connected to families,

16:46.940 --> 16:53.340
more focused on enabling civic engagement as well as academic competencies.

16:53.340 --> 16:58.180
And I think that is really part of what we're going to see on the state board's agenda over

16:58.180 --> 16:59.460
the coming year.

16:59.500 --> 17:06.020
I think many of us have really understood that we don't want to return to the status

17:06.020 --> 17:12.300
quo with many of the inequities that have plagued the system of education in every state

17:12.300 --> 17:13.300
for many years.

17:13.300 --> 17:18.940
But we want to return to a new normal, to a new new deal in which the work that we've

17:18.940 --> 17:26.740
been engaged in over the last decade really does come into fruition with the opportunity

17:26.780 --> 17:31.380
to think differently about how we organize schools, about how we support our educators,

17:31.380 --> 17:33.980
and about how we support our students.

17:33.980 --> 17:44.860
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to the SPE screening committee's recommendations

17:44.860 --> 17:51.580
for ACCS, for ACSC, for CPAC, and for IQC.

17:51.820 --> 17:59.900
We're going to first take up the screening committee's recommendations for those appointments.

17:59.900 --> 18:05.340
The public comment slide should be put up now.

18:05.340 --> 18:11.700
I'm hoping that that will appear.

18:11.700 --> 18:14.700
We're going to open the phone line for public comment.

18:14.700 --> 18:20.380
Hopefully the public comment slide will appear so that will be easy to do and the public

18:20.380 --> 18:22.940
members will have the instructions.

18:22.940 --> 18:31.220
I will read them but I hope you'll also see them because this is a lot to take in auditorily.

18:31.220 --> 18:40.620
Members of the public wishing to provide comment on this item may do so by calling 712-432-0075

18:40.620 --> 18:44.500
and entering access code 651-905.

18:44.500 --> 18:47.580
There we go, there's the public comment slide.

18:47.580 --> 18:51.860
And while we're waiting for any members of the public to call in, I want to ask Vice

18:51.860 --> 18:57.060
President Strauss, who chaired this year's process, to share the recommendations from

18:57.060 --> 19:01.820
the screening committee regarding appointments to the Advisory Commission on Tourist Schools,

19:01.820 --> 19:06.940
the Advisory Commission on Special Education, the California Practitioners Advisory Group,

19:06.940 --> 19:08.980
and the Instructional Quality Commission.

19:08.980 --> 19:10.980
Well, good morning.

19:10.980 --> 19:17.540
I was joined this year by members Ting Sung and members Cynthia Glover Woods, who worked

19:17.540 --> 19:22.940
really, really hard through this process and we're a great team together.

19:22.940 --> 19:28.340
For each of our Advisory Commissions, a state board staff member and a CDE staff member

19:28.340 --> 19:29.940
joined us as well.

19:29.940 --> 19:33.740
So for the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools, we have 15 applications.

19:33.740 --> 19:38.860
I'll just say we have an additional opening we'll be posting next week and we're going

19:38.860 --> 19:42.180
to be interviewing for Charter School Administration.

19:42.180 --> 19:46.140
For the Advisory Commission on Special Ed, we have 27 applications.

19:46.140 --> 19:50.540
For the California Practitioners Advisory Group, we had nine.

19:50.540 --> 19:55.300
And for the Instructional Quality Commission students, we had nine.

19:55.300 --> 20:00.140
So it is my pleasure to give the state board the recommendations.

20:00.140 --> 20:07.820
We're recommending reappointment for a two-year position to Wesley for the Advisory Commission

20:07.820 --> 20:12.220
on Charter Schools for Wesley Siever, who's currently a superintendent in Kingsburg Elementary

20:12.220 --> 20:16.620
Charter School District, who represents district superintendents, and Erica Jones, a teacher

20:16.620 --> 20:19.340
in Los Angeles Unified, representing teachers.

20:19.340 --> 20:21.540
That's for the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools.

20:21.540 --> 20:24.980
These are reappointments for two years.

20:24.980 --> 20:30.260
We're also recommending an appointment for two years for Andrea Fasel.

20:30.260 --> 20:34.660
She's a teacher at Downtown College Prep representing teachers.

20:34.660 --> 20:36.780
And we're recommending that for a two-year term.

20:36.780 --> 20:39.460
There's an addendum that was just posted on this.

20:39.460 --> 20:45.100
For the Advisory Commission on Special Education, we're recommending that the following individuals

20:45.100 --> 20:46.100
be appointed.

20:46.100 --> 20:52.420
Stacey Adler, Superintendent of Mono County, Office of Education, representing three categories,

20:52.420 --> 20:57.100
a parent and student with disability, state and local official or administrator, and also

20:57.100 --> 20:59.100
representative of charter schools.

20:59.100 --> 21:05.140
Marie Alvarado-Gil, Regional Director of Rocketship Education, she's a parent of a disability,

21:05.900 --> 21:07.620
and represents charter schools.

21:07.620 --> 21:12.260
And Sarah Notch, who's the Executive Director, Special Education and Instruction for San Mateo

21:12.260 --> 21:18.820
County Office of Education, parent of a student with a disability, and a state or local official

21:18.820 --> 21:20.740
or administrator.

21:20.740 --> 21:25.980
For the Advisory Commission recommendation to the California Practitioners Advisory Group,

21:25.980 --> 21:29.580
we're recommending three reappointments for a two-year term.

21:29.660 --> 21:35.460
Jesse Levin, an educational researcher working for the American Institute for Research.

21:35.460 --> 21:41.060
Ed Manasala, the Superintendent of El Dorado County, representing superintendents or other

21:41.060 --> 21:42.060
administrators.

21:42.060 --> 21:46.100
And Nancy Portillo, Chief of Staff for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, representing private

21:46.100 --> 21:48.540
school children.

21:48.540 --> 21:54.100
For the appointment to the California Practitioner Advisory Group, we're recommending a three-year

21:54.100 --> 21:57.060
term for Mia Cooper.

21:57.060 --> 22:00.900
She's representing the specialized instructional support personnel.

22:00.900 --> 22:04.940
She works in San Bernardino City Unified School District.

22:04.940 --> 22:11.220
For the Instructional Quality Commission, we are recommending, so you might know that

22:11.220 --> 22:15.100
as a result of students appearing in front of the school state board a couple of years

22:15.100 --> 22:19.620
ago and then going to the legislature, we have the authority to appoint one of our IQC

22:19.620 --> 22:22.580
members as a student instead of an adult.

22:22.580 --> 22:26.020
And so this year actually is the first year a student is serving during their senior year

22:26.100 --> 22:28.100
on the Instructional Quality Commission.

22:28.100 --> 22:32.980
So this appointment will be for next year's, for senior, she's a junior now and she'll

22:32.980 --> 22:34.980
be serving in her senior year.

22:34.980 --> 22:39.860
This is Juliana Garcia, she's a junior at John F. Kennedy Middle College High School

22:39.860 --> 22:45.940
in Coronerco Unified School District, and she will be appointed for the IQC.

22:45.940 --> 22:52.180
Those are the recommendations of these four screen committees.

22:52.180 --> 22:58.340
And I would just ask, I would just say we interviewed amazing candidates with incredible

22:58.340 --> 23:03.940
experience and willingness to serve the state of California and support our students.

23:03.940 --> 23:06.980
It was a pleasure to meet them, and we did it on Zoom this year, so we actually got to

23:06.980 --> 23:13.060
see them rather than just talk on the telephone, and it was a really thoughtful, really engaging

23:13.060 --> 23:14.060
conversation.

23:14.060 --> 23:19.380
I just would ask if Member Glover-Woods or Member Sung wanted to make any comments about

23:19.380 --> 23:23.780
the screening process, and then I would move approval of these recommendations.

23:25.140 --> 23:27.140
Thank you.

23:27.140 --> 23:29.460
Good morning, and thank you, Member Strauss.

23:29.460 --> 23:35.060
I will just echo what you said as far as the pleasure it was to serve on the screening

23:35.060 --> 23:37.540
committee and meet such phenomenal people.

23:37.540 --> 23:45.060
Also, again, just to underscore the phenomenal nature of the students that we had opportunity

23:45.060 --> 23:47.620
to meet during the interviewing process.

23:48.580 --> 23:53.380
Our future is indeed bright and, again, quite excited to see the young people that are coming

23:53.380 --> 23:55.380
through.

23:55.380 --> 23:56.100
Awesome.

23:56.100 --> 24:01.140
Yeah, and I would also echo all of the comments made by my colleagues.

24:01.140 --> 24:06.900
It was the first time that I served on this screening committee, and I was, too, just

24:06.900 --> 24:16.500
amazed by the educators and the parents who applied for the positions, and it was really

24:16.500 --> 24:19.700
difficult through the paper screening as well as through the interviews.

24:19.700 --> 24:24.820
So really appreciated the opportunity to be able to talk and meet with all these people.

24:25.380 --> 24:30.740
And I would also echo Member Glover-Woods' comments about the students.

24:30.740 --> 24:32.180
Oh, so inspiring.

24:32.180 --> 24:32.980
Just made our day.

24:34.980 --> 24:40.660
Yeah, so I think that Governor's going to have a hard time making a selection, and I'm

24:40.660 --> 24:43.780
glad that we're going to honor all of those finalists.

24:44.580 --> 24:49.060
We're open for public comment, and then we'll come back for any board discussion on this

24:49.060 --> 24:51.140
item before we take a motion.

24:51.140 --> 24:52.500
Is there any public comment?

24:53.140 --> 24:55.460
Yes, we have one person in the queue.

24:58.180 --> 25:01.540
Caller, welcome to the State Board of Education meeting.

25:01.540 --> 25:04.100
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

25:04.100 --> 25:05.460
Your time starts now.

25:07.140 --> 25:09.060
My name is Lindsay Noffelt.

25:09.060 --> 25:13.220
I'm a parent with a second grader at Berkeley Unified School District.

25:14.180 --> 25:18.020
I'm calling to express my concerns about the Statewide Literacy Plan.

25:18.660 --> 25:20.180
As you continue to review...

25:20.740 --> 25:22.100
Caller, pardon me.

25:22.820 --> 25:24.900
This is only for item two.

25:24.900 --> 25:26.180
We would ask you to...

25:26.180 --> 25:27.220
Or I'm very sorry.

25:27.220 --> 25:31.540
For item one, we would ask you to call back during public...

25:32.900 --> 25:35.620
General public comment later this afternoon.

25:35.620 --> 25:36.120
Thank you.

25:39.940 --> 25:42.740
Is there any other public comment on this item?

25:43.940 --> 25:46.260
No, there are no other callers at this time.

25:47.460 --> 25:47.960
All right.

25:48.820 --> 25:50.740
We're now open for board discussion.

25:50.740 --> 25:57.460
Maybe we can take the screen down, the screen share down, so it's easier to see all the

25:57.460 --> 25:58.180
board members.

25:58.900 --> 26:00.820
Is there any board discussion?

26:00.820 --> 26:06.980
Feel free to raise your hand in the participant list, or I can watch for you to raise it in

26:08.100 --> 26:08.900
person as well.

26:11.460 --> 26:12.900
Any discussion from the board?

26:13.780 --> 26:16.980
I am seeing none.

26:18.020 --> 26:21.620
So at this point, I think we're ready for a motion.

26:22.500 --> 26:29.780
So I move approval of the recommendations for the screening committee for ACCS, ACSE,

26:30.420 --> 26:32.260
CPEG, and IQC student.

26:33.220 --> 26:33.620
All right.

26:33.620 --> 26:34.020
Thank you.

26:34.660 --> 26:36.980
And do I have a second?

26:36.980 --> 26:37.620
I'll second.

26:38.260 --> 26:39.220
Thank you very much.

26:39.780 --> 26:41.140
Any further board discussion?

26:42.180 --> 26:42.660
All right.

26:43.780 --> 26:47.540
We're going to ask you to raise your hand in the participant panel of Zoom.

26:48.100 --> 26:49.300
Let's see if we can all do this.

26:49.300 --> 26:50.820
This is a performance task.

26:51.700 --> 26:53.460
You've got to go to the participant.

26:54.580 --> 26:55.460
I'm sorry.

26:55.460 --> 26:57.700
I think we need to call the roll, which I can do.

26:57.700 --> 26:58.100
Okay.

26:58.100 --> 26:58.500
Yeah.

26:58.500 --> 27:00.820
The script said raising hands, and that was a new one.

27:01.460 --> 27:02.020
Okay.

27:02.020 --> 27:03.300
Hold the roll call.

27:03.300 --> 27:04.740
Brooks, please call the roll.

27:04.740 --> 27:05.220
Yes.

27:05.220 --> 27:08.980
I will note that some people successfully accomplished the performance task that I want

27:08.980 --> 27:09.620
to recognize.

27:10.900 --> 27:11.780
Duly noted.

27:11.780 --> 27:13.220
And now on the public record.

27:14.340 --> 27:14.980
Member Burr.

27:16.260 --> 27:16.760
Aye.

27:18.100 --> 27:19.140
President Darling-Hammond.

27:20.100 --> 27:20.600
Aye.

27:21.380 --> 27:22.180
Member Fatah.

27:23.540 --> 27:24.040
Aye.

27:24.740 --> 27:25.780
Member Glover-Woods.

27:27.220 --> 27:27.720
Aye.

27:28.500 --> 27:29.380
Member McQuillan.

27:30.820 --> 27:31.320
Yes.

27:32.260 --> 27:32.980
Member Navo.

27:34.100 --> 27:34.600
Aye.

27:35.220 --> 27:36.420
Member Patil-Brownson.

27:37.860 --> 27:38.360

27:39.300 --> 27:40.260
Member Rodriguez.

27:41.460 --> 27:41.960
Aye.

27:42.420 --> 27:43.140
Member Rucker.

27:44.420 --> 27:44.920
Yes.

27:47.620 --> 27:48.420
Member Strauss.

27:49.300 --> 27:49.800
Yes.

27:50.260 --> 27:50.900
Member Son.

27:52.180 --> 27:52.680
Aye.

27:53.540 --> 27:54.260
It's unanimous.

27:55.860 --> 27:56.260
All right.

27:56.260 --> 27:57.140
Thank you very much.

27:57.940 --> 28:03.300
We'll move on to the draft preliminary report of actions and minutes for the September 10th,

28:03.940 --> 28:07.940
2020 board meeting while we're waiting for any members of the public to call in.

28:08.740 --> 28:10.900
And maybe we should put that public comment.

28:10.900 --> 28:14.900
And call in slide up again.

28:16.740 --> 28:21.620
Do I have a motion from a board member to approve the September 10th, 2020 state board

28:21.620 --> 28:26.100
of education draft preliminary report of action meeting minutes?

28:27.140 --> 28:28.260
I will move approval.

28:28.820 --> 28:29.700
Thank you very much.

28:29.700 --> 28:30.660
Do I have a second?

28:31.300 --> 28:31.940
I second.

28:32.900 --> 28:33.860
Thank you very much.

28:34.980 --> 28:36.340
Are there any public comments?

28:36.340 --> 28:38.980
No, we do not have any public comments.

28:40.260 --> 28:40.820
All right.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.260
Any further discussion?

28:44.980 --> 28:45.620
All right.

28:45.620 --> 28:48.740
Brooks, will you please call the roll for the roll call vote?

28:49.220 --> 28:49.860
Member Burr.

28:50.820 --> 28:51.320
Aye.

28:51.860 --> 28:52.900
President Darling-Hammond.

28:53.700 --> 28:54.200
Aye.

28:54.980 --> 28:55.700
President Fatah.

28:56.660 --> 28:57.380
Member Fatah.

28:57.380 --> 28:57.880
Aye.

28:58.260 --> 28:58.820
I elevated you.

29:00.820 --> 29:02.020
He will be president of something.

29:02.020 --> 29:02.980
We're all about student voice.

29:02.980 --> 29:03.540
Of something.

29:03.540 --> 29:04.900
We're all about student voice.

29:06.740 --> 29:07.700
Member Glover Woods.

29:09.220 --> 29:09.720
Aye.

29:10.180 --> 29:11.060
Member McQuillan.

29:12.260 --> 29:12.760
Yes.

29:13.140 --> 29:13.860
Member Navo.

29:14.660 --> 29:15.160
Aye.

29:15.620 --> 29:16.740
Member Patil Brownson.

29:17.940 --> 29:18.440
Yes.

29:18.820 --> 29:19.700
Member Rodriguez.

29:23.140 --> 29:23.640
Yes.

29:24.180 --> 29:24.900
Member Rucker.

29:25.940 --> 29:26.440
Yes.

29:26.740 --> 29:27.780
Vice President Strauss.

29:28.660 --> 29:29.160
Yes.

29:29.540 --> 29:30.180
Member Sun.

29:31.220 --> 29:31.720
Aye.

29:32.260 --> 29:32.760
Synonymous.

29:33.700 --> 29:34.200
All right.

29:34.980 --> 29:35.480
All right.

29:36.820 --> 29:41.540
And I'm not yet seeing our state superintendent, so we're going to go ahead and launch into the

29:41.540 --> 29:42.740
liaison reports.

29:44.420 --> 29:49.220
I want to invite you to report out on any liaison activities that were not related to items in our

29:49.220 --> 29:50.820
November agenda.

29:52.180 --> 29:57.540
We'll begin by calling on board members in reverse alphabetic order based on last name,

29:57.540 --> 29:58.900
and I'm going to start with Lisa.

30:00.900 --> 30:01.400
Hi.

30:02.040 --> 30:09.720
So the California Workforce Pathways Advisory Committee is meeting in a couple weeks on the

30:09.720 --> 30:10.220
20th.

30:10.840 --> 30:15.960
We'll be getting an update on the CTIG grant and the K-12 Workforce Grant.

30:15.960 --> 30:21.880
The applications have come, the, sorry, the selections have been made, and so we'll get

30:21.880 --> 30:22.680
an update on that.

30:23.800 --> 30:28.520
And just an update on the work that we're doing with the statewide

30:29.160 --> 30:35.480
the Career Technical Education Plan, and that's really all I have to report.

30:36.360 --> 30:36.860
All right.

30:37.800 --> 30:38.840
Vice President Strauss.

30:40.040 --> 30:40.540
Thanks.

30:40.540 --> 30:47.880
On September 16th, the Instructional Quality Commission met, and then the State Literacy

30:47.880 --> 30:52.120
Grant, they reviewed it, and it went out for public comment.

30:52.120 --> 30:57.560
Also, the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, the public comment period has now ended.

30:57.560 --> 31:03.720
And we'll be meeting on the 18th and 19th and going over the next round of edits, and

31:03.720 --> 31:06.600
I'll be joined by member Glover Woods and member Rucker.

31:07.320 --> 31:10.760
On September 17th, the Science Collaboration Committee met.

31:10.760 --> 31:14.920
That's the effort to continue to implement next generation science standards throughout

31:14.920 --> 31:15.640
the state.

31:15.640 --> 31:20.840
They're doing a lot of work to help teachers with distance learning and providing really

31:20.840 --> 31:26.680
wonderful opportunities for assessments and benchmarks and lots of promising practices.

31:27.080 --> 31:28.440
It's a great support network.

31:28.440 --> 31:34.280
I think a lot of our content is doing that, and I just really am honored to be part of

31:34.280 --> 31:38.360
it and to watch how they connected the work to equity and social justice.

31:38.360 --> 31:46.280
On the 21st of October, the Advisory Commission on Special Education met, and they did an

31:46.280 --> 31:51.480
update on the State Performance Plan and looked at the system of support and how we're

31:51.480 --> 31:54.280
supporting school district, particularly for students with special needs.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.760
I just have to say it was just wonderful to listen to the report.

31:58.760 --> 32:03.720
If you have some time to look at that commission meeting and to see the kind of work we're

32:03.720 --> 32:09.880
doing with distance learning to support special needs students, particularly the support of

32:09.880 --> 32:16.520
inclusive practices presentation that we heard was really heartwarming to see the wonderful

32:16.520 --> 32:22.360
practices during the pandemic to address distance learning and the barriers to inclusion.

32:22.520 --> 32:28.520
We also got a report from the state special schools and how they're working on instruction

32:28.520 --> 32:33.640
during COVID-19, and I think we know everybody's working so hard, but these were highlights,

32:33.640 --> 32:38.600
particularly serving our students with the challenging learning situations and learning

32:38.600 --> 32:39.640
needs.

32:39.640 --> 32:43.800
We had a report on the California Special Education Funding Report.

32:43.800 --> 32:49.480
It's a study that was done by WestEd and talking about the challenges in special ed funding,

32:49.640 --> 32:56.760
in special ed funding, particularly around what is equal practice, how do we align our funding

32:56.760 --> 32:59.320
systems, and what is the role of selfless.

32:59.320 --> 33:03.800
I think we'll be hearing a lot more about this, but it was really quite important to

33:03.800 --> 33:04.360
listen to.

33:04.360 --> 33:09.160
Again, it's on the advisory customer special ed website from that meeting.

33:09.160 --> 33:11.560
I think you'd be interested in hearing more about that.

33:12.120 --> 33:16.520
And then we have a new special ed director, Heather Calamese, coming to us from Illinois,

33:16.520 --> 33:19.480
and she did an update on the activities of the division.

33:20.280 --> 33:27.480
And then we had to wish and thank Summer Harding and Sarah Walker, who served for eight years on

33:27.480 --> 33:28.440
the commission.

33:28.440 --> 33:29.240
They had two terms.

33:29.240 --> 33:33.480
They both served on the commission and were really wonderful members as well.

33:35.240 --> 33:40.040
California is part of the National Association of State School Boards of Education,

33:40.840 --> 33:45.400
State Boards of Education, and they had a western regional meeting on Friday, October

33:45.480 --> 33:46.360
23rd.

33:46.360 --> 33:51.640
So I was really interested to know that our western area includes islands, including

33:51.640 --> 33:54.920
American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands.

33:54.920 --> 33:56.680
And so it was really interesting to see.

33:56.680 --> 33:58.600
It was all done, obviously, remotely.

33:58.600 --> 34:03.160
But to hear what other states are doing, I would say they did highlight our work in advancing

34:03.160 --> 34:09.640
social emotional learning in California for the western area, and also discussed what

34:09.640 --> 34:13.560
different states are looking at during COVID, particularly around student support,

34:13.560 --> 34:15.960
accountability, and policy.

34:15.960 --> 34:17.000
So very interesting.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.480
First time I've been part of NASP, and I think we will look forward to continuing collaboration

34:21.480 --> 34:22.760
with them as well.

34:23.800 --> 34:30.120
The new president of NASP comes from Utah, State Board of Education, and is part of the

34:30.120 --> 34:30.840
western group.

34:33.160 --> 34:38.680
And then the California State University has two advisory boards.

34:38.680 --> 34:43.000
One that, remember, Darlene Hamm and I served on a real meeting next week on quantitative

34:43.000 --> 34:47.320
reasoning, looking at fourth year of math preparation in high school for students so

34:47.320 --> 34:48.920
they're ready for college.

34:48.920 --> 34:56.120
But they are opening another one, a new initiative starting on Tuesday, calling the center to

34:56.120 --> 34:57.400
close the opportunity gap.

34:57.400 --> 35:01.320
And I think this really addresses a lot of what we've been talking about in California,

35:01.320 --> 35:03.480
about getting our students ready.

35:03.480 --> 35:09.640
And so they're looking at evidence-based strategies to eliminate opportunity gaps.

35:10.200 --> 35:14.760
So they'll be looking at joint initiatives to increase academic success.

35:14.760 --> 35:18.680
That center opens next week, and I'll have more information once it opens.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.320
That concludes my report.

35:22.120 --> 35:22.680
All right.

35:22.680 --> 35:23.480
Member Rucker.

35:26.440 --> 35:27.480
Well, good morning.

35:28.520 --> 35:34.520
I work with Board Member Song on the Career Technical Education panel.

35:35.160 --> 35:40.440
As Board Member Strauss already pointed out, we work together on the IQC issue.

35:40.440 --> 35:43.240
So I won't repeat any of those reports.

35:43.240 --> 35:47.960
I'm also working with NASB on the Whole Child Study Group.

35:47.960 --> 35:54.040
We have been meeting every other month since the group was created back in the spring.

35:54.600 --> 36:00.680
We're continuing to expand our discussion about what it means to support students and schools

36:00.680 --> 36:04.760
in this environment as more schools attempt to open and make the transition,

36:04.760 --> 36:09.000
the full-time face-to-face instruction in the midst of this pandemic.

36:09.640 --> 36:14.200
There's a lot of work being done to collect and develop guidance and collect models

36:14.200 --> 36:19.400
of good practice from schools and districts across the states.

36:20.040 --> 36:25.160
California models, several of the ones that Dr. Darling-Hammond already mentioned,

36:25.800 --> 36:28.520
are being included and being looked at by NASB.

36:28.520 --> 36:31.000
Our next meeting is coming later on this month.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.240
I believe it's on November 17th.

36:33.240 --> 36:42.520
I'm also involved as the liaison to the State Council of Support for Military Involved Children.

36:42.520 --> 36:45.240
These are dependents of military parents.

36:45.240 --> 36:52.120
And we have been meeting with our new support commissioner, Kai Jackson, on a very regular basis.

36:52.840 --> 36:57.320
One of the primary goals this year includes expanding the involvement

36:57.320 --> 37:00.440
of other military communities, including the Coast Guard,

37:01.720 --> 37:06.680
as representatives on this State Council to discuss matters for transition and engagement

37:06.680 --> 37:10.840
of students who transfer into our schools.

37:10.840 --> 37:15.080
Our current legislative liaison is Assemblymember Ty Gloria.

37:15.080 --> 37:21.720
And with the changeover with the election, we are waiting for the legislature to identify

37:22.120 --> 37:28.840
who our next legislative liaison will be appointed for this activity and for that position.

37:29.880 --> 37:33.240
Finally, the last thing that I will briefly report on

37:33.240 --> 37:37.880
is I am the liaison for the Math Curriculum Framework Committee.

37:37.880 --> 37:41.320
The Curriculum Framework Committee has had a meeting, two meetings,

37:41.320 --> 37:44.440
since our State Board of Education meeting in September.

37:44.440 --> 37:50.440
We met in September, in October, and we just completed a set of meetings in November.

37:50.440 --> 37:56.920
The committee has made some recommendations to the board asking particularly about board policy

37:56.920 --> 38:02.040
and the criteria and policy that the board created for guidance for the framework and

38:02.040 --> 38:04.680
the development of the framework for the committee.

38:05.400 --> 38:09.080
Rather than presenting those recommendations to the board today,

38:09.080 --> 38:12.840
because we couldn't take action on their request at this point anyway,

38:12.840 --> 38:18.440
there is going to be a scheduled meeting with the writers and department and State Board of

38:18.440 --> 38:22.120
Education staff on Monday, and I'll be facilitating that discussion.

38:22.120 --> 38:27.960
We'll be taking a look at not only the board's current recommendations and guidance for the

38:27.960 --> 38:33.720
development of the framework, but also take a look at how we will take an in-depth discussion

38:33.720 --> 38:39.480
on the development of Chapter 12, the criteria for the publishers, as well as looking at and

38:39.480 --> 38:45.640
understanding what the recommendations will be for course development, whether we're looking at

38:45.640 --> 38:51.160
the integrated courses or the recommendations that districts may consider in creating course

38:51.160 --> 38:56.600
pathways through the high school program, as well as the assignment on Algebra 1 for students

38:56.600 --> 39:01.480
beginning in 8th grade, and I'll be ready to report that information back to the board

39:01.480 --> 39:02.760
at the September meeting.

39:02.760 --> 39:05.160
So this Monday's meeting is unusual.

39:06.120 --> 39:11.800
It's a unique opportunity for us to have some very in-depth discussion at a point in time

39:11.800 --> 39:17.320
where made multiple decision points, important decision points that will revolutionize and

39:17.320 --> 39:22.840
really change the intent and purpose of the framework will be considered and developed.

39:22.840 --> 39:27.080
So I'm looking forward to being able to come back and make a presentation to the board

39:27.080 --> 39:29.000
about that at the January meeting.

39:29.640 --> 39:30.840
That's the end of my report.

39:31.640 --> 39:32.280
Awesome.

39:32.280 --> 39:33.320
Member Rodriguez.

39:35.400 --> 39:36.280
Yes, good morning.

39:37.080 --> 39:46.840
So I attended the October 8th and 9th CTC meeting as a liaison, and there is a new student liaison,

39:46.840 --> 39:54.440
but I'm going to come back to her in just a minute because I want to go over some of the data that

39:54.440 --> 39:59.000
was covered regarding teacher prep programs.

39:59.960 --> 40:09.240
The annual report card was presented, and the CTC dashboards are just – they do not disappoint.

40:09.240 --> 40:15.880
If you have not been on CTC's website, please go on there and search and dig, and you'll get lost in

40:16.760 --> 40:20.680
just tremendous amount of depth and breadth of information.

40:20.920 --> 40:33.320
So some of the highlights from that report are, you know, that more teachers, it appears,

40:33.320 --> 40:37.640
are being instructed by K through 12 staff than institutions of higher learning.

40:39.320 --> 40:43.560
And for a more traditional route, 15,000 K through 12 staff

40:44.520 --> 40:50.280
provided supervised clinical experience, and for the alternative IHE-based route,

40:50.280 --> 40:56.200
6,000 K through 12 staff provided supervised clinical experience.

40:58.200 --> 41:03.320
There was also, you know, the highlights on STIPS and PIPs, right, which are some of the

41:04.200 --> 41:11.320
waivers that are provided by the CTC or districts, you know, and they have STIPS or

41:11.320 --> 41:14.520
for acute staffing need due to unforeseen circumstances.

41:15.480 --> 41:23.560
In the 2018-19 report, 3,600 STIPS were issued, right, you know, and again, the concern is

41:23.560 --> 41:29.880
having a qualified, highly qualified teacher in front of all of our students here in California.

41:30.760 --> 41:37.320
And then the PIPs, 2,500 PIPs were issued in the year 2018-19.

41:37.800 --> 41:43.800
There are limited assignment teaching permits. These are for credentialed teachers who are working

41:43.800 --> 41:49.240
outside of their credential area while working for an authorization.

41:49.240 --> 42:01.560
Hi, Jay, I think you have an internet problem.

42:06.440 --> 42:08.440
We'll give it a, there she is, you're back.

42:08.440 --> 42:15.640
Oh, wow, it cut off, disappeared. All right, so I hope that you heard all the way up to the

42:16.600 --> 42:23.400
variable term waivers. And so these are the final option for employers to meet staffing needs

42:24.440 --> 42:31.640
when a suitable, fully qualified candidate cannot be found. And there were 400 new waivers issued

42:31.640 --> 42:41.240
in 2018-19. The commissioners really emphasized how much they want for communication to exist

42:41.240 --> 42:48.120
between the Ali-8s and the educator preparation programs and for there to be a,

42:50.360 --> 42:52.840
are you, am I still here? You're still here.

42:55.560 --> 43:01.560
And so, you know, and as part of the teacher candidate program, there's an individual

43:01.560 --> 43:09.560
development plan that guarantees the continual improvement of the candidate as they're going

43:09.560 --> 43:15.480
through the process, right? So that as they go through the process with a supervised mentor

43:17.240 --> 43:23.960
or, you know, the qualified teacher, they become, they're fully prepared to take on the challenges

43:23.960 --> 43:34.040
of the classroom. There was, there were a few examples within some of the accreditation reports

43:34.040 --> 43:39.560
of where some of these programs are working beautifully, right? And that's what we need to

43:39.560 --> 43:44.520
really strengthen so that the quality of our teachers that are coming into the workforce

43:46.040 --> 43:51.480
are being able to meet the needs of our students. And especially right now that we're having such

43:51.480 --> 43:59.160
challenging times, especially for our teacher, our current students that are in teacher prep programs

43:59.800 --> 44:06.680
given the environment that we're all in. I'd like to highlight a teacher residency program.

44:07.320 --> 44:15.640
LA USD conducted collaborative meetings with the residency partners. They discussed program

44:15.640 --> 44:21.080
components and really highlighted their exemplary partnership. And that's something that,

44:22.440 --> 44:27.960
you know, would, is important to highlight and recognize and continue so that there is

44:29.480 --> 44:37.240
strong partnerships between the teachers, the IHEs, the districts, and they're working together

44:37.240 --> 44:47.480
to build better prepared teachers. So the, additionally, you know, the CTC is also

44:47.480 --> 44:55.240
responsible for teacher discipline. And the number of cases that are, that have been open

44:55.240 --> 45:02.200
have gone down considerably. And the staff that works in this department

45:03.240 --> 45:10.440
has just worked arduously to continue processing the cases. You know, there have been

45:11.560 --> 45:18.440
funds that have been dedicated, making sure that the legal staffing is there and that these are

45:18.520 --> 45:25.800
getting worked out and carried through in a way that's beneficial to all parties

45:25.800 --> 45:34.360
and that there's due process. But I'd like to come back and highlight the beginning of the meeting,

45:34.360 --> 45:42.680
you know, when commissioners do their reports, it was very emotional. And it has been very emotional

45:42.680 --> 45:51.560
for the last few meetings as we're talking about the racial inequities, right, that we're just,

45:56.600 --> 46:04.520
it seems like confronting with a lot of commitment in California and having these

46:04.520 --> 46:08.600
discussions about what our students are going through and what our teachers are going through.

46:09.560 --> 46:18.680
And, you know, some of my colleagues on that commission, counselors, teachers, just feeling

46:18.680 --> 46:26.200
like, you know, they're having a hard time with everything that's happening, right, whether it's

46:26.200 --> 46:32.200
the civil discourse or being online and not being able to be there for our students the way we are

46:32.280 --> 46:40.520
when we're face-to-face. And we brought in a new, or there's a new student liaison, her name is

46:40.520 --> 46:46.920
Corey Jones. I keep saying we because it feels like I just left the CTC. But Corey Jones, she's

46:46.920 --> 46:57.640
a new student liaison and she was just, she was captivating in her commitment, in her voice,

46:57.640 --> 47:03.800
very powerful and thoughtful. And she just broke through this digital environment.

47:04.840 --> 47:14.520
And I just really felt her desire to humanize, right, and bring that thing that we can't really

47:14.520 --> 47:22.360
put a label on in teaching that, you know, being able to embrace our students and carry them on

47:22.360 --> 47:29.320
to learning and to continue. And so one of the things that she said is that trying to become a

47:29.320 --> 47:37.320
teacher, right, she's a student teacher right now, in this ambiguous time is so challenging.

47:37.320 --> 47:44.600
And anybody who is either teaching or teaching teachers or working with teachers or students,

47:44.680 --> 47:54.440
it just shout out resilience. And so it was very powerful to hear that because it's true and I want

47:54.440 --> 48:01.800
to, you know, acknowledge everybody, all of us in education who are confronting this. And if

48:03.480 --> 48:09.240
Commissioner Martin from San Diego Unified, who is actually, her district I think is mentioned

48:09.240 --> 48:17.080
in the report that we're going to be looking at in a bit. She read a poem by Maya Angelou

48:18.600 --> 48:25.800
and it was incredibly, you could see everybody, we were all crying. And I'd like to share that

48:25.800 --> 48:34.920
with you because it really, it took Corey Jones, our new student liaison's words and everything

48:34.920 --> 48:39.800
that all of the teachers and counselors were feeling about the social emotional component,

48:40.760 --> 48:45.720
students and teachers just feeling like they're at the end of their rope. And so without further

48:45.720 --> 48:55.080
ado, if you'll indulge me, the poem is Continue. My wish for you is that you continue, continue to

48:55.080 --> 49:03.400
be who and how you are, to astonish a mean world with your acts of kindness, continue to allow

49:03.400 --> 49:10.120
humor to lighten the burden of your tender heart, continue in a society dark with cruelty

49:10.120 --> 49:16.520
to let the people hear the grandeur of God in the peals of your laughter, continue to let your

49:16.520 --> 49:23.400
eloquence elevate the people to heights they had only imagined, continue to remind the people

49:23.400 --> 49:30.200
that each is as good as the other and that no one is beneath nor above you, continue to remember

49:30.920 --> 49:37.320
your own young years and look with favor upon the lost and the least and the lonely, continue

49:37.320 --> 49:43.000
to put the mantle of your protection around the bodies of the young and defenseless, continue to

49:43.000 --> 49:48.760
take the hand of the despised and diseased and walk proudly with them in the high street some

49:48.760 --> 49:56.200
might see you and be encouraged to do likewise, continue to plant a public kiss of concern on the

49:56.200 --> 50:02.600
cheek of the sick and the aged and the infirm and count that as natural action to be expected,

50:03.240 --> 50:09.240
continue to let the gratitude, the pillow upon which you kneel to say your nightly prayer

50:09.800 --> 50:17.720
and let faith be the bridge you built to overcome evil and welcome good, continue to ignore no

50:17.720 --> 50:25.240
vision which comes to enlarge your range and increase your spirit, continue to dare to love

50:25.240 --> 50:32.840
deeply and risk everything for the good thing, continue to float happily in the sea of infinite

50:32.840 --> 50:41.320
substance which set aside riches for you before you had a name, continue and by so doing you and

50:41.320 --> 50:51.560
your work will be able to continue eternally. Thank you. Thank you IJ. That is a wonderful

50:51.560 --> 51:00.760
sentiment on which we can be reflecting today. I see that State Superintendent Tony Thurman is

51:00.760 --> 51:07.720
here. Welcome Tony. We are in the midst of liaison reports but we're going to come back to those and

51:07.720 --> 51:15.320
let you make your remarks at this point. Good to see you. Good morning Madam President and I'm happy to

51:15.320 --> 51:24.200
wait until the liaison reports are complete. All right then we will continue and so Member

51:24.200 --> 51:34.280
Patio Bronson you are next up. Great so I wanted to give an update on some of the liaison work

51:34.280 --> 51:40.920
on early childhood, early learning. As you all might recall back in 2019 the Governor and the

51:40.920 --> 51:49.400
legislature approved two new bodies. One was the early childhood policy council to provide advice

51:49.400 --> 51:56.920
and counsel on early learning policy issues and it also commissioned the master plan for learning

51:56.920 --> 52:02.680
and care which was modeled on the higher ed master plan to create a long-term planning

52:03.720 --> 52:09.960
effort in order to ensure that it is a thoughtful systemic rollout of how the system grows and

52:09.960 --> 52:17.640
supports early learning for our youngest students. The major tenants that they were looking to

52:17.640 --> 52:22.920
address were around funding reform, around workforce development, preschool expansion,

52:23.880 --> 52:30.680
mixed delivery encompassing both family child cares, center-based programs and school district

52:30.680 --> 52:39.000
programs, shared services, and data sharing so that eventually we can link the early learning

52:39.000 --> 52:47.640
data with the K-12 data and actually provide a path towards longitudinal tracking to figure out

52:47.640 --> 52:52.200
how kids are progressing and what services and dosages of services they're receiving.

52:53.080 --> 52:58.760
What's exciting I think is that the master plan committee which is being led largely by Wested

52:59.640 --> 53:08.120
has frontlined a number of themes around equity for the most vulnerable, partnerships with

53:08.120 --> 53:16.360
families, developing the workforce, and a whole child approach which in the parlance of K-12

53:16.360 --> 53:23.720
oftentimes tracks to social emotional learning but also is encompassing of health, mental health,

53:23.720 --> 53:32.680
developmental screenings, IEPs. So the original plan was to have a master plan by October 1st

53:32.680 --> 53:40.440
but for very reasonable reasons related to COVID the date has been moved back but there has been

53:40.440 --> 53:47.960
quite a bit of outreach and stakeholder feedback. There were two large meetings with the parent

53:47.960 --> 53:57.400
advisory committee and with the workforce advisory committee in September and the expectation is that

53:57.400 --> 54:04.440
it will be made public before the end of the year and the date will be announced soon. We have

54:05.240 --> 54:12.600
our preview meeting as the early childhood policy council to see some of the early recommendations

54:12.600 --> 54:22.280
coming up later this month on November 16th and I think maybe just it's helpful to put a

54:23.240 --> 54:29.240
shine a light on how the two systems are working together. Many family child cares have not closed

54:29.240 --> 54:38.200
during the pandemic at all and have moved from the traditional role of serving younger children

54:38.200 --> 54:43.400
but also now serving younger children and school-aged children and oftentimes playing the role

54:43.400 --> 54:48.280
of ensuring that when parents are essential workers and kids need help getting online

54:49.240 --> 54:54.680
that they are playing that parent support role for so many kids in order to make sure that they

54:54.680 --> 55:03.960
can participate for virtual learning and I think and I'll stop there because I think we're running

55:03.960 --> 55:08.760
a little bit tight on time so I look forward to being able to share the recommendations as they

55:08.760 --> 55:16.120
come out and by January we should have lots more specificity to share with this group.

55:18.280 --> 55:26.120
Linda I think you're on mute did you call me?

55:28.440 --> 55:29.720
Yes I called you on mute.

55:32.200 --> 55:38.680
That's great hello everyone yeah and board president I apologize for my for not being

55:38.680 --> 55:43.400
able to do my background in complete transparency I have three teenagers in this house so if they

55:43.400 --> 55:48.040
walk by mostly boy teenagers are unaware of their surroundings so I'm just going to say it right now

55:48.040 --> 56:00.840
you are freezing can you hear me now okay so I'll update I'll be brief I'll update great

56:00.840 --> 56:05.960
I'll update on we have four goals related to the CCE I'll be brief and highlight two of those goals

56:05.960 --> 56:11.560
so that we can hear from our state superintendent goal one is related to direct technical assistance

56:11.560 --> 56:16.600
and CCE has been working on developing the progress monitoring for LEAs receiving direct

56:16.600 --> 56:22.120
technical assistance and they're currently working on producing a public facing visualization

56:22.680 --> 56:28.760
that conveys the progress of LEAs receiving direct technical technical assistance and that work is

56:29.640 --> 56:36.520
primarily the learning that's coming from Alameda County Office of Ed and Oakland Unified School

56:36.520 --> 56:44.040
District and that work will produce an impact report at the end of the 2021 school year that

56:44.120 --> 56:50.120
will be produced annually to to show the impact of direct technical assistance across the state.

56:51.160 --> 56:55.960
Goal three is the facilitation and development and implementation of structures and relationships

56:55.960 --> 57:01.640
and processes to support the expansion of the system of support and I'd like to thank board

57:01.640 --> 57:07.240
member Strauss for highlighting the AXE presentation on the system of support that was done October 21st

57:07.240 --> 57:14.600
so Dr. Carla Estrada as well as our SELPA content leads participated in that presentation the SELPA

57:14.600 --> 57:20.120
content lead for evidence-based practices SELPA content lead for English learners and the SELPA

57:20.120 --> 57:24.680
content lead for universal design for learning and I would agree with board member Strauss

57:25.240 --> 57:31.080
incredibly appreciative and also the CCE received some good feedback about promoting those resources

57:31.080 --> 57:37.640
to engage more general education practitioners and lastly the hashtag come back California

57:38.280 --> 57:42.840
CCE has been working on sharing tools and resources and practices to facilitate dialogue among

57:42.840 --> 57:48.200
LEAs as they navigate the challenges on returning students to school and all of this information

57:48.200 --> 57:54.040
can be found at the CCE website which has had a makeover and it looks it's really easy to navigate

57:54.040 --> 58:01.240
so cce-ca.org and again thank you to Sue Burr for the found laying the foundation for the CCE

58:01.240 --> 58:07.560
she contributed many years of service to the CCE and all of the good work that's coming out now is

58:08.280 --> 58:15.240
as part of her leadership and so just thank you Sue and that will do it for me. Great. Member McClellan.

58:15.960 --> 58:23.960
Thank you. This past month I had the pleasure in the honor of participating on the superintendent's

58:23.960 --> 58:31.720
round table on Native American studies. I was impressed it was a it was a rather short meeting

58:31.720 --> 58:40.040
but a great turnout and the number of folks listening and participating was was quite large.

58:40.040 --> 58:49.320
It covered you know accuracy in studies of Native Americans. Some of the challenges are that there

58:49.320 --> 58:56.760
are so many tribes in California over 120 federally recognized tribes and trying to select curriculum

58:56.760 --> 59:05.400
that covers and accurately covers all the tribes throughout California will be a challenge and then

59:05.880 --> 59:12.120
will be a challenge and then our diversity in the state you know what happens in northern

59:12.120 --> 59:18.520
California compared to southern California very different but I'm really looking forward to

59:18.520 --> 59:26.520
this process and continuation of it and again a very big turnout of folks who were on the call.

59:28.440 --> 59:34.760
The second thing you're going to hear later today so my participation in the student advisory board

59:34.760 --> 59:40.440
on education helping those students prepare for their later presentations today that you'll be

59:40.440 --> 59:47.240
hearing but it was a fantastic process and very impressed with the students and their preparation

59:47.240 --> 59:55.000
for what they'll be presenting later today. It was it was a fun process that's all I have. Thank you.

59:56.360 --> 59:59.720
All right thank you very much. Member Glover Woods.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:07.640
Thank you and most of my comments I gave during item one. I did have opportunity of course to be

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:13.000
part of this screening committee. I did share my comments for that and Vice President Strauss did

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:20.600
cover the information for the upcoming IQC work around the ethnic studies model curriculum. So I

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:25.960
have nothing further to add there. I will just share I did have opportunity to participate

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:33.560
to participate in the NASBE convening that took place last month and in particular the

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:40.680
session that was held for new state board members was quite informative a great orientation and if

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:49.160
there are any newer state board members that I'd like to see what was discussed I think they are

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:54.120
going to archive that particular presentation and that's all I have to share at this time. Thank you.

01:00:54.440 --> 01:01:01.320
Thank you. Member Fattah. Thank you President Darling-Cham and this past weekend I had the

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:06.280
honor of attending the Student Advisory Board of Education hosted by the California Association of

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:13.000
Student Councils from October 30th to November 2nd. As board member McQuillen already echoed

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.560
we're going to be hearing from them a little bit later today but my role at that conference was just

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:22.680
facilitating the election process for next year's student member on the state board of education.

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:29.240
And so the student delegation at the conference narrowed down the 12 semi-finalists that the

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:34.760
screening committee selected to six finalists after hearing them deliver speeches and speaking

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:43.080
with them directly and I also staffed board members Strauss, Sun and McQuillen on the interview

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:47.640
committee to select the top three candidates who we will be recommending and I believe it's item two

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:53.560
to the governor. We will also be meeting shortly and I think I speak on behalf of all four of us

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:57.400
when I say that it was an incredibly difficult decision probably one of the most difficult

01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:02.840
decisions I've ever had to make to narrow down those six candidates to three and that

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:10.520
concludes my liaison report. All right thank you. Member Burr. Good morning. All of the issues that

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:16.120
I worked on will be coming up either today or tomorrow so I'm anxious to hear from Superintendent

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:24.840
Thurman that completes my report. Thank you and I'm going to give one item for us and then move

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:33.080
straight to our state superintendent. This has been a month of many many meetings of all the

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:38.600
education groups. We do belong to the National Association of State Boards of Education as I

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:47.240
mentioned earlier. I served on a NASB panel on how state boards can promote equity and spoke about

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:53.800
a lot of things that are already on route in California but also heard from some other

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:58.840
state board leaders about what they're doing around equity in their states so that's a very

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:06.040
interesting conversation and one that you may want to tune into. The video and audio from that are

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:12.600
available and will be sent to you with a link not only from that session but from the whole

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:20.920
conference. A lot of talk about the importance in this moment of really humanizing education

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:28.840
so a link to member Rodriguez's comments that I think is coming out a lot of discourse in education.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:38.120
I'm going to with that turn the floor over to State Superintendent Tony Thurman. Tony, great to see you.

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:42.920
Thank you Madam President. Good morning, good morning board members and good morning to everyone

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:48.760
who's following today. We hope that wherever you are you continue to be safe and well. Today I get

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:54.600
to join you from the California School for the Deaf in Fremont. I have been having the opportunity

01:03:54.600 --> 01:04:00.520
to work here and work at the California School for the Deaf in Riverside and I can tell you that

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:06.440
both of our schools offer incredible preschool programs to help many students who have no exposure

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:12.840
to language until they start school. I also want to mention the California School for the Blind also

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:18.920
in Fremont. We have three incredible schools serving incredible students with great educators

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:24.760
doing great things even in the pandemic. I also want to just thank all the board members. Many of

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:29.880
you have had a chance to either be on phone calls with or Zooms. It feels like we're in regular

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:35.480
communication always with the state board president on issues on a regular sometimes on the daily.

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:41.240
I'm grateful for the opportunity to speak with board members Rucker and I think I've been on

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:47.560
at least a handful of Zooms with board member Fatah and his great leadership and advocacy for

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:54.360
students in ethnic and racial justice in the state. Thank you board member McQuillin for joining

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:02.280
our virtual teaching conversation about how we teach correct and culturally competent

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:06.600
learnings about Native American history in California schools.

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:12.760
Thank you board member Dr. Glover Woods for the wonderful introduction of school board members

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:17.800
in San Bernardino and Riverside counties. It's an honor to see you all madam president,

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:24.040
madam vice president. I want to start off by again just acknowledging the resilience

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:32.120
of our students, our educators, administrators, and their families. We've been at this since March

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:39.480
addressing the impacts of the pandemic, addressing the impacts of racism, addressing the impacts of

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:46.840
fire, and now something I never knew existed election anxiety and hearing people say that

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:53.320
anxiety even from the election can create physical manifestations for people and so we want to

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:59.480
encourage those who need it to reach out to your provider if you need support to reach out to support

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:05.480
wherever you can get it. The biggest conversation continues to be school reopening. Many of our

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:10.680
schools have opened. Many of our school districts have set opening plans that lead them in the run

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:18.440
up from now to January. Many have used the small learning pods model to figure out how to get open

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:25.000
and our schools still continue to have conversations about how to open safely. That continues to be

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:31.000
the key conversation and our staff is leaning in with many of our school district leaders to

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.640
ask the question, what's the impacts of distance learning? What are you seeing? What is your

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:41.320
experience? How are you measuring learning in real time? We're happy to share some reports with you

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:48.200
as we go. Our chief deputy Dr. Stephanie Gregson has been in conversation with many of our large

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:55.160
districts to hear some of their lessons learned already just months into this next round of

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:59.240
distance learning which we're happy to share with you. We're grateful to our partnership with the

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:04.680
Office of Emergency Services to help us get personal protective equipment to school districts.

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:11.480
This is among the top priorities in order for our schools to be able to safely open and remain open

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:20.280
is PPE and access to robust testing and there's still many conversations going on. The governor

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:27.640
and his team are announcing a new way to augment testing for schools. We've been in conversation

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:32.760
with school districts, mayors of our largest cities, all who are coming together to say how

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:38.520
can we open? On the subject of PPE, I want to thank General Motors who's come forward in a

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:46.520
new partnership and donated 500,000 masks that we can distribute to school districts across our state.

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:52.040
We've prioritized in the delivery of those masks our tribal communities where we know there is

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:57.720
disproportionate impact as it relates to the pandemic. We prioritize communities where there

01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:03.480
are higher risks and underlying health issues. We've even been able to send some masks and we're

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:09.080
working with OES to get child-sized masks for children of farm workers, many of whom do not

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:15.800
have access to PPE, many of whom both children and their parents are often working outside where

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:21.800
air conditions are not good. Again, thank you to OES and others who helped us to send masks to make

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:30.840
sure that they are protected. Again, this is a very tough time. Everyone is leaning in to make

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:37.240
this work. I give our students and our educators and their families A-plus for effort. I want to

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:42.200
let you know that we have some great teachers everywhere, but I want to acknowledge a handful

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:49.960
today who have been selected to be the teachers of the year in 2021. The pandemic has caused many

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:56.600
celebrations to end, but we've decided it is important to continue to recognize excellence

01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:02.200
in the teaching profession and in education for our classified workers in spite of the pandemic.

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:07.880
So allow me just to share these names of these teachers and where they serve so that you may be

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:15.080
aware of them. The first is Jim Klipfel, who's a ninth grade high school teacher in social studies

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:21.000
at Saugus High School in the William S. Hart Union High School District. He not only will be

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.520
one of our teachers of the year, but he is my nominee to be a national teacher of the year,

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:31.720
and he'll be competing against teachers of the year candidates from all of the 50 states. I'd

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:37.000
like to also introduce you to Allison Sear, who's a third grade multiple subject teacher at Lyndon

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:43.240
B. Johnson Elementary in the Desert Sands Unified School District. We had a wonderful conversation.

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:46.680
She couldn't believe it that the state superintendent was calling her to tell her

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:53.240
that she had been selected. I told her that honor is ours to be able to lift up teachers

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:58.040
during this time. I want to acknowledge Kisa Brown, who's a seventh and eighth grade

01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:04.040
introduction to Spanish and advocate teacher at University Heights Middle School in the Riverside

01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:09.080
Unified School District, another fabulous example of what our educators are doing,

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:13.960
and Laura E. Gomez-Contreras, who I've asked to become, I've asked all of our teachers of the

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:19.480
year to become advisors to us. Laura was sharing so many great examples of how we close the digital

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:26.040
divide. She is also a third grade multiple subject teacher at Martin Elementary School in the Santa

01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:32.440
Ana Unified School District, and finally, Nora Nguyen, a sixth through eighth grade Spanish teacher

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:38.440
at McKinley'sville in the McKinley'sville Union School District in Humboldt County.

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:44.040
Salutes to all your wonderful educators. Thank you for what you do, and congratulations on being

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:52.040
named as our Teacher of the Year for 2021. As you've heard from Board Member McQuillan,

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:58.280
we've made our focus, our continuing focus, how do we use education to address hate. We're

01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:03.560
looking forward to the IQC meeting later this month. Tomorrow we'll be posting some updates,

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:08.760
places where we made adjustments to the curriculum, and what we see is a very robust conversation

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:13.160
about how to strengthen the curriculum, how to strengthen the model, and how to create the model

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:18.120
that school districts can use in the future to continue to have important conversations as our

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:23.960
students ask to see representations of people of color and their contributions to California,

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:29.640
to our nation, and to our world. As we prepare to run up to the Ethnic Studies conversation,

01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:35.400
I want to come back to the conversation that I shared with you, that we have selected 11 school

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:41.160
districts to receive mini grants to have professional development to do what we call education to end

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:46.440
hate. This means that we've awarded grants to districts to allow them to have anti-racism,

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:51.960
anti-bias training, and we've connected them with trainers, world-class trainers who can help them

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:55.880
in doing that. There's more than 11 school districts. We're happy to share that with you.

01:11:55.880 --> 01:12:01.720
I do want to also share with you that we will be holding a handful of professional developments

01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:07.720
hosted by CDE, virtual professional developments, where we continue to delve into conversations

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:14.440
about how education can counter hate, following up on the wonderful conversation we had with educators

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:20.280
about culturally competent pedagogy as it relates to Native American history and what we teach our

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:25.480
students and how we offset things that get taught that sometimes aren't even in our standards

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:33.400
and sometimes cause harm to our students. We will be hosting this month on the week of November 16th

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:38.840
a first conversation, a professional development, a virtual professional development on teaching

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:43.800
Native American history and Native American studies. Stay tuned for details there. That

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:51.320
will be followed on December 8th by a professional development webinar on countering anti-Semitism.

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:56.760
We've seen a rise in acts of anti-Semitism around the world. We've seen many of our students across

01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:04.200
the country being tracked with anti-Semitic hate. And then on January the 12th, we will begin a

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:09.560
conversation about how we counter Islamophobia in our classrooms. We know that many of our students

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:15.400
are impacted by misperceptions and stereotypes in the things that they sometimes hear even in

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:20.520
school and bullying and things of that nature. And so on January 12th, we will begin a conversation

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:30.040
for educators, professional development on how to counter Islamophobia. One quick update on our

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:36.280
efforts to close the digital divide. Just want to thank some donors who've come forward in what is

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:43.640
now a $420,000 donation of technology to communities in the San Diego area with the priority

01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:48.520
on tribal communities that have been without access to computers and the internet. I want to

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:54.680
thank San Diego Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Gas and the San Diego Community

01:13:54.680 --> 01:14:01.240
Foundation for making this work. We continue our efforts to ensure that the internet will

01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:07.480
flow like electricity. And myself, Chief Deputy and others have participated in the legislative

01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:13.960
hearings on how to close the digital divide. We're preparing to make an announcement of a new

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:19.720
innovation competition. We're inviting Californians who are innovators, who have access to research

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:26.200
and development to help us identify the next big solution to close the broadband gap, focusing on

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:31.000
those communities in our state that don't even have the infrastructure to have broadband. I want

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.440
to thank Dr. Gary Michaelson and Genentech who've already made donations that have taken us to

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:43.480
upwards of $500,000 for a cash prize for this competition. Stay tuned for more updates. My final

01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:49.480
announcement is really a thank you to the staff at the California Department of Education and the

01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:54.440
staff at the State Board of Education for their endless work to continue to support a thousand

01:14:54.440 --> 01:15:01.400
school districts and to support six million students. I have to call out a TSD. I lost track.

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:07.640
We've done 90 plus webinars since the pandemic has started, but I've lost count. I'm sure we're

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:12.200
upwards of a hundred. We haven't had a single break in, not going wood. We've been able to deliver

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:17.480
the messages to school districts without interruption. I got to thank our communications team

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:22.440
who continue to help us get the word out about devices and grants that we've made available.

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:27.560
Our teams that work in special education and nutrition services. Many of you know that at the

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:31.960
top of the pandemic, we were serving meals at 5,000 different locations. Our schools are really

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:37.960
getting it done. Our early learning and education teams, there's a big transition taking place

01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:44.120
where many of our subsidized child care programs will be moved into the Department of Social

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:50.360
Services. This is very difficult for us, but we're taking it on faith that there's the opportunity

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:57.480
to streamline and maximize what families get in our subsidized child care programs when all the

01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:03.000
programs live together in one agency. But I have to acknowledge everyone who works in child care

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.800
and everyone who works in early education and of course, expanded learning. What people forget

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:12.440
is that during the pandemic after school programs do a lot of great things to augment what students

01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:16.280
learn during the day and they have safe and structured places. I know I'm going to get in

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:20.040
trouble because there are other divisions that I have not mentioned. All of our division directors

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:24.040
are great. All of our exec team members are great, but I got to shout these folks out who've been

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:29.640
doing incredible work to support an entire education sector during the pandemic. Madam President,

01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:33.720
this concludes my report and I would submit to any questions from you or any of the members.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:40.840
Thank you so much. We really appreciate it. And with that, we're going to move on ahead to

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:47.000
item number two and we'll get that one done before we take a little break.

01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:54.120
Item two is the 2021-22 State Board of Education student member recommendation of three finalists

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:58.920
for submission of the governor for consideration and appointment. These are the students I was

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:05.960
thinking about earlier and that member Fattah identified in his comments. The State Board of

01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:11.800
Education screening committee recommends that we approve the three finalists for the position of

01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:18.280
student member as identified in the addendum. The item will be presented by screening committee

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:26.920
chair, Vice President Strauss. Vice President Strauss, please begin. As I do my presentation,

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:31.720
you see that the finalists have joined us, so you'll actually get to see the students in person of

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:38.120
the ones we're talking about. So let me just say we had 74 students apply to be the next student

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:44.280
board member for next year. It was an amazing number. Reading those applications, we had to

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:52.440
narrow to 12 and it was tough. Amazing. And then we, and this is the process we use every year,

01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:59.160
the 12 students then present their platforms and what they want to do to the student committee,

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:07.080
what you're going to hear from. The students then narrow that 12 to 6. So then we had the pleasure,

01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:13.960
member Sung, member McClellan, myself, member Fattah, and Patricia DeCosmo State Board, we

01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:20.680
got to interview six. It was, as Zaid said, the hardest decision we ever had to make. So for all

01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:26.680
of you who are going to present today, let me just say it was our highest point. It was so amazing.

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:31.400
The future of California is in great hands for the next generation based on the students I'm

01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:37.080
going to introduce you to now. So the students that we are recommending in alphabetical order

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:43.400
as our free finalists, these will be presented to the governor. He's going to have a really hard

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:50.040
time, but let me introduce them to you now. Rana Banaka, she's from Modesto High School within the

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:55.880
Modesto City School District in Stanislaus County. Zachary Patterson at University City High School

01:18:55.880 --> 01:19:01.960
within the San Diego Unified School District in San Diego County. And Jayden Stewart, North Hollywood

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:07.800
High, highly gifted magnet within the Los Angeles Unified School District in Los Angeles County.

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:14.520
Those are our three finalists. But we have to name our semi-finalists, so let me tell you who they are.

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:21.320
Stephanie Hu from Tesoro High School within the Capistrano Unified School District in Orange County.

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:27.640
Jeffrey Oh from South Pasadena High School within the South Pasadena Unified School District in Lake

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:33.240
County. And Katherine Sue at Westlake High School within the Conejo Valley Unified School District

01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:40.520
in Ventura County. These were the semi-finalists that were presented to the students and I want

01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:45.320
to recognize them and we will be mailing them all a certificate. Normally they get to come in front,

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:49.480
we give them a certificate, we take their picture. We're going to have to do the best we can remotely,

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:53.560
but I just want to let all the students know that we will be sending you a certificate in

01:19:53.560 --> 01:20:00.120
recognition of your achievement. Michael Blair from James Enix High School within Modesto City

01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:05.720
Schools in Stanislaus County. Paula Escobar, Evergreen Valley High School within the Eastside

01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:11.480
Union High School District in Santa Clara County. Alexander Phan from Centennial High School within

01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:16.840

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:22.440
Unified School District in Stanislaus County. Benjamin Soloth, Oakland Technical High School

01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:28.440
within the Oakland Unified School District in Alameda County. And Jennifer Tran, Bolsa Grande

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:32.920
High School within the Garden Grove Unified School District in Orange County. So I present to you,

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:41.000
those are our semi-finalists and our finalists. What an amazing group of students and when we're

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.800
ready, I'll be most happy to make a recommendation to the board for approval of our part three.

01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:54.680
Awesome and congratulations to all of you. It's wonderful to get a chance to see you. You look

01:20:54.680 --> 01:21:01.800
fabulous and we just appreciate so much all that you are doing and all that you will do

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:08.280
in the careers that you have to come. I want to put the public comment slide up if we can.

01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:15.480
And while we are waiting for members of the public to call in, can we get that slide up?

01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:20.520
I want to invite other board members who participated in this year's student selection process,

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:26.200
if they have any other initial comments and then we will see if they have any comments.

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:40.520
I just want to echo Member Strauss' comments as well. Zachary, Stephanie, Raina, Jeffrey,

01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:49.720
Jayden, Catherine, you guys were amazing and it was so difficult in our decision. You inspired me

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:56.120
and I feel so much better about our future. So thank you so much for your time and the work

01:21:56.120 --> 01:22:01.240
that you did in putting into the interview and the application process and congratulations to

01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:10.760
the three that will be going on. Thanks. Wonderful and Jim? Yes, I just wanted to

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:15.400
echo the same thing. I was so impressed with all the students, their preparation,

01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:20.760
reading their applications and the letters of recommendations that were so strong.

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:28.040
I'm also very hopeful about our future. After hearing from these students and their leadership

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:33.400
qualities, I'm just so impressed with them. So thank you for allowing me to participate.

01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:43.720
Terrific. Any other comments at this moment? We do want to see if there's any public comment.

01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:49.080
Is there any public comment? There are no public comment speakers at this time.

01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:58.120
All right. We're open for any board discussion and you can raise your hand in the participant

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:11.160
or you can just wave your hand at me. Any other board comments? I will make a motion

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:18.520
to approve the three finalists to send to the governor's office for a state student board member

01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:24.200
for the following school year. Sounds great. Do I have a second? I will second.

01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:31.640
Go ahead. Go ahead, say. Oh, I will second. All right. That seems very appropriate.

01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:36.360
We'll now have a roll call vote. Brooks, will you please call the roll? Member Burr.

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:49.240
Aye. President Darling-Hammond. Aye. Member Fatah. Aye. Member Glover-Woods. Aye. Member McQuillan.

01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:19.800
At this point, we'll take a 10-minute break. I'm going to also hand the gavel to Vice President

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:25.000
Strauss for the next item when we return because I have to be in another meeting for a short time.

01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:31.720
We'll see you back. It is now 9.57. We'll see you back at 10.10.

01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:42.280
We'll try to build those in today, just so you know. This item is an annual item for us.

01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:49.880
It is presented by the student representatives of the 2020 Student Advisory Board on Education,

01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:57.640
better known as SABE. Actually, I have to just say it's a highlight of our work. What you're

01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:03.000
going to hear today from the students could impact practice going forward. Let me just say,

01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:08.280
we really listen carefully and we are very excited to hear this presentation.

01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:11.320
Eileen, I apologize. We need to reestablish the quorum.

01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:17.000
Sorry. Brooks, would you please call the roll? Of course. Member Burr.

01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:24.840
President Darling-Hammond. Member Fattah.

01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:28.200
Here. Member Glover-Woods.

01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:31.480
Here. Member McQuillan.

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.200
Here. Member Navo.

01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:37.320
Here. Member Patella Brownson.

01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:42.200
Sorry. Yeah, I have to go. Here. Member Rodriguez.

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:44.920
Here. Member Rucker.

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:48.040
Here. Vice President Strauss.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.680
Here. Member Son.

01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:54.600
Here. Thank you.

01:25:56.200 --> 01:26:00.680
Okay, thank you. Actually, I thought we might have to do that, so I appreciate you correcting

01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:06.520
me and we'll do that in the future after our breaks. So now we're going to hear from the

01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:13.880
2020 Student Advisory Board on Education and I'm going to ask Elijah Tsai, President of the

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:20.680
California Association of Student Councils, and Diego Bustamante, the 2020 Sabe Director

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:26.920
and CASC Education Policy Director, to provide introductory remarks and they will then introduce

01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:31.480
all of our individual student presenters for the seven topic areas that we're going to hear.

01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:35.640
Elijah and Diego, please begin.

01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:42.440
Elijah Tsai Good morning, State Superintendent Thurmond,

01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:46.520
President Darlene Hammond, Vice President Strauss, esteemed members of the State Board

01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:51.000
of Education and honored guests. My name is Elijah Tsai and I'm a senior at Lincoln High School

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.840
in San Joaquin County and the current state president of the California Association of

01:26:54.840 --> 01:27:01.480
Student Councils. Since its inception in 1927, CASC has amplified the student voice, providing

01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:06.600
avenues for young leaders to be heard during key moments in history. This year has been like no

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:11.800
other. Facing a tumultuous world, California students have experienced tremendous adversity,

01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:18.360
each unique to themselves. This year's Student Advisory Board on Education has brought students

01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:23.400
together from all over California, combining their experiences to represent the student voice.

01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:29.160
An integral part of this conference and our delegation has been an election process for

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:35.720
the 2021-2022 student board member on the State Board of Education. I'd like to commend many of

01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:41.240
the people who have made this conference and election process possible. The 12 semi-finalists

01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:45.160
who have taken an active role in our candidacy and their respective proposals, the Board of

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:50.280
Education staff, and the current student board member Zej Fatah for conducting the elections

01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:55.800
he went through only a year ago. Our consistent platform of presentations to the State Board of

01:27:55.800 --> 01:28:01.400
Education is an utmost honor. Once again, it's CASC's privilege to represent this California

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:06.680
Department of Education's emphasis on the inclusion of student voice in the development of education

01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:12.840
policy. Without further ado, I welcome the CASC Education Policy Director Diego Bustamante for

01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:20.200
more details on the conference. Thank you for that introduction, Elijah. Good morning and thank you,

01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:24.360
Superintendent Tony Thurmond, President Darling-Hammond, Vice President Strauss, and esteemed

01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:28.520
board members for allowing us this amazing opportunity once again. My name is Diego

01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:32.280
Bustamante and I am a senior at Lincoln High School in Stockton's Lincoln Unified School District.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.680
I am the current Education Policy Director to the California Association of Student Councils

01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:41.640
and the 2020 Student Advisory Board on Education Conference Directorate. For over 50 years, students

01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:46.040
from all over California have come to critique, assess, and evaluate the state of their public

01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:50.600
education and their school systems at the annual Student Advisory Board on Education Conference.

01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:55.560
This year's conference took place from Saturday, October 31st to Monday, November 2nd and was

01:28:55.560 --> 01:29:02.360
composed of 72 delegates representing all of CASC's 12 regions. It is important to acknowledge the

01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:07.320
significance of this year's SAVE. During a normal year, we would all be in Sacramento right now and

01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:11.800
the delegation of students would be sitting behind me filling every available seat and dressed in

01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:16.520
their business professional attire. However, as with the majority of everyday tasks and events,

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:21.880
the COVID-19 pandemic has forced us to adapt. This year's conference took place virtually

01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:26.200
with each student connecting from their own home through their personal or school-issued computer.

01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:31.640
In light of the shift to distance and hybrid learning, this year in specific has seen the

01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:35.640
amplification of many of the negative patterns and faults in our education system, in addition

01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:41.320
to bringing forth a whole host of new issues and discrepancies. The student voice has and will always

01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:45.480
be a critical perspective in the decision-making process, but student feedback within education

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:51.000
has never before been of greater consequence as we strive towards a more equitable education

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.880
system in the age of COVID. The students who made up this year's delegation are intelligent,

01:29:55.880 --> 01:30:00.440
show exceptional initiative, and are open to both feedback and change. Their passion for

01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:04.440
their own education, their willingness to be flexible, and their drive to enact positive

01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:08.520
change in the systems around them inspires not only me but the rest of my staff as well.

01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:13.640
Our qualifications are this, we are the ones who wake up early in the morning and attend school

01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:18.600
in whatever fashion that may be this year. We are the ones who experience the California education

01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:24.040
system. These delegates here have proven themselves to be competent in advising the

01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:30.440
State Board of Education. With this in mind, this year's delegates have had complete control over

01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:35.320
the topics presented to you today. With no bias from staff members, delegates debated, voted,

01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:41.080
and decided upon seven topics that truly embody what the delegation views to be areas of concern

01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:45.960
in the California education system. Over the course of three days, they took it upon themselves

01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:51.160
to compress all of our different experiences, ideas, passions, wants, and needs into seven

01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:56.280
thorough proposals. The seven issues that the Student Advisory Board on Education has decided

01:30:56.280 --> 01:31:01.720
are areas of concern that need to be addressed in our education system are in order. Student

01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:09.240
representation, civic engagement, racial equity, school safety, mental health, distance learning,

01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:15.320
environmental and environmental sustainability. If you would like to view our packet of proposals,

01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:22.440
you can check out the agenda item on the CDE website or also go to tinyurl.com slash save 2020.

01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:28.680
That's tinyurl.com slash s-a-b-e 2020. Our first presentation will be on the topic of student

01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:32.920
representation presented by Benjamin Salem. Thank you very much.

01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:38.200
Good morning, esteemed members of the California State Board of Education. My name is Benjamin Salem

01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:42.440
and I attend Oakland Technical High School. On behalf of the Student Advisory Board on Education,

01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:45.800
we recommend that the State Board of Education encourage local district governing boards to

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:49.800
appoint students to district-wide subcommittees and create statewide guidelines outlining the

01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:53.640
rights and roles of youth leaders, promoting this change by appointing youth to all statewide

01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:58.440
commissions and creating a state SVM advisory board. From a young age, we as youth are told

01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:04.760
our voices don't matter. Our teachers, our families, even our friends reinforce that we

01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:08.360
are powerless in our decisions. Elective representatives actively discourage youth

01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:12.600
from advocating for equality and change, eliminating accountability and activism.

01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:16.760
In Oakland, our schools began to reduce the general budget in 2018 without consulting our

01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:22.040
LCAP student directors, one which was me. During this time, our entire restorative justice team,

01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:25.560
our foster case workers and the school breakfast team were reduced to a total budget of zero

01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:30.040
dollars. Students consistently and tirelessly protested these cuts, but without representation

01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:34.440
and discussions, we were powerless. Hundreds of students lost crucial support services that they

01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:39.400
relied on without these programs. Imagine what would have changed if students had been centering

01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:43.480
this discussion and if we had students at the table on budget cuts, the district would not

01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:48.520
eliminate these services. Throughout our research and development process on local representation,

01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:52.120
we identified the systematic effects of lack of leadership. Elected student board members

01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:56.520
were repeatedly ignored by their colleagues on the board, and these youth elected by student body

01:32:56.520 --> 01:33:00.200
were not allowed to attend their board meeting, relegated to sitting on Zoom while their adult

01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:05.320
peers spoke freely. Similarly, in Palo Alto and Oakland, superintendent advisory councils and

01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:09.400
other leadership groups were canceled due to COVID-19 without considering the ramifications

01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:13.880
of student leadership or the viable options of hosting virtual meetings. Many districts create

01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:17.560
a series of hurdles to prevent youth from speaking their mind and creating change in their communities,

01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:21.400
only exacerbated by the lack of any precedent or institutionalized support for youth.

01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:26.440
To combat this, we must expand these pre-existing governing bodies to all district decision-making

01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:30.680
groups, allowing youth to serve in local positions of leadership, like their district subcommittees.

01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:35.240
We recommend these opportunities are protected by a clear set of rights for youth officials

01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:39.320
overseeing their roles and responsibilities, creating guidelines for youth legal partnerships.

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:43.720
We believe the exemplary leadership demonstrated by CSBA and the State Board of Education can be

01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:47.960
replicated in all districts, including students in all decisions and therefore achieving performance

01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:51.800
goals. The strategy of inclusion benefits both students and school board members,

01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:55.480
allowing both sides to support students and promote leadership. We believe that less than

01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:59.560
$5,000 required per school district to implement these positions, with an optional cost to appoint

01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:04.440
a student advisor. But regardless of the cost of impacts or initiatives, there are countless

01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:08.120
benefits to appointing youth to positions of leadership. Student board members already serve

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:11.720
as some of the most passionate advocates for youth initiatives, and other youth will advocate

01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:15.960
for their other priorities. We observe that students and students represented in our education

01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:20.520
are more likely to pursue research and support, and are more prepared for life beyond high school.

01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:23.800
Districts without a student board member almost exclusively score failing grades in performance

01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:27.800
and college readiness, demonstrating inequities exacerbated without a student balance. And the

01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:31.800
simple act of instigating this change offers youth the opportunity to confront prevalent issues in

01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:36.120
their communities, which drastically increases youth opportunity and student achievement so that

01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:40.360
most represented districts excel in performance. This positive change is demonstrated by the

01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:45.480
effects in San Francisco USD. In 2018, their district created an SPM position, appointing

01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:49.480
two students from the district, and over the course of that first year, SF Unified achieved

01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:53.640
significant improvements in student performance, finally achieving a rating of green from the CDE

01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:57.720
dashboard. I can attest to the fact that representatives on boards lead to lasting

01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:02.520
performance and stability, as SPMs effectively identify unnecessary initiatives and successful

01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:08.280
programs. By standing in front of you, as a student, as a leader, and as a changemaker in my community,

01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:12.520
passionate about representation. It is integral for us to serve and uplift students as they are

01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:16.200
key stakeholders in our education. We must be certain that every student leader has equal

01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:20.040
rights and opportunities to support their peers. This is why we recommend that the Board of Education

01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:23.880
encourage governing boards and administration to appoint at least one people to each board

01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:27.480
and district committee. We believe these changes will meaningfully impact student achievement in

01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:31.480
our schools, and through this, we hope to lift the voices of our peers. Thank you.

01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:44.840
Great, we'd be happy to take any questions or comments from board members now.

01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:51.720
So Dia, just to clarify, do you want board members to make comments after each of the

01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:56.920
seven, or do you want to hold till the end of the seven? Yes, if we could have comments

01:35:56.920 --> 01:36:04.200
after each one, that would be great. Okay, so this one is about student representation

01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:09.240
on boards and the voice to gain critical perspectives from students. Do we have any

01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:22.920
board member comments? Oh, should I have to raise my hand? Yeah, go ahead, go ahead. Okay,

01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:27.080
thank you, Board Member Strauss, and thank you so much, Benjamin, for your passionate speech.

01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:33.320
I think there was a part of your proposal in which you talked about the possibility of creating a

01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:39.480
student board member student advisory board for the state SBM position, and I think that that's

01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:43.000
an idea that we should definitely consider on the state board because

01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:50.120
I feel as though the student board member on the state board's perspective is currently informed

01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:56.600
just based on conversations had with members of organizations such as the California Association

01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:02.680
of Student Councils and GENEP, and I think that therefore it's kind of more shaped by interactions

01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:07.640
and independent research rather than kind of working in tandem with individuals who understand

01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:12.040
certain regions of our state better than the student board member can research, and so I think

01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:17.720
that that's definitely something that we should consider as we kind of move forward with this

01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:22.040
state student board member position, creating the student advisory board, because I think that that

01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:29.720
can help the state student board member kind of inform their perspective a lot more, and yeah,

01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:33.480
thank you. Thank you. Member Rucker, you have your hand up.

01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:43.000
Thank you. First of all, I want to thank all of the students who participated in developing

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:49.400
this proposal and having the conversations about it. Normally at the board meeting, if we were

01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:54.360
sitting at the dais, they would be in the room sitting in the audience and we would ask them

01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:59.640
to stand so they could be recognized for their participation in putting the report together, and

01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:04.760
that's not something that can be done today, so I just want to make sure that for all the students

01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:10.920
whose names appear in this report, and it's been posted, I recognize you and I really do thank you

01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:17.000
for your thoughtful approach and the ideas that you developed in this project. I do have a question

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:23.240
concerning the idea of the student board member advisory committee. When you think about student

01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:30.840
voice, the student voice at this dais and at this level has come to be represented by the students

01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:36.360
who come to this annual convening as members of the advisory committee for the state board

01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:43.160
and my colleague on the state board, Zahid Fattah, but I want you all to think about and look back

01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:49.960
at your own campuses. There are many, many students on your campus who serve in a leadership

01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:58.760
capacity in many ways on your campus, and while I think your proposal is highly laudable and worth

01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:05.720
considering for the work that is done to appoint and identify the student member, I think that the

01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:13.640
power of your recommendation and your idea is its ability to expand who the student voices are

01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:20.040
that can be represented in these type of advisory committees. So we're not just looking at one type

01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:27.000
of student voice for setting policy, but all of the student leadership voices at your campuses

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:33.720
that contribute to creating the culture and the climate at your school. This is an opportunity

01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:41.000
and a vehicle for expanding and giving a place to those leadership voices as well. So I really

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:47.720
would like to encourage you to think about that too. Thank you very much. Member McQuillin, I

01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:52.040
believe you have your hand up and you've been part of this process. Do you want to make any comments

01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:57.720
about this student representation proposal? I would just like to thank the students for all

01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:06.680
their work and their flexibility. This is an unusual time that the students have shown a lot

01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:14.680
of resiliency in attending this conference virtually and I know they've sacrificed a lot by

01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:21.080
not going in person. I just wanted to thank the students for this presentation and all of the

01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:27.880
students for their good hard work. Thank you. Thank you, Member McQuillin. So I would say just

01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:32.360
to the rest of the board, when we listened in the student interviews about student voice and

01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:38.440
perspective, we heard some amazing ideas besides advisory committee, including usually in social

01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:43.880
media to make sure they got student perspectives. So I do think as the world is changing, as

01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:49.560
technology becomes so much a part of all we do and students do, there are really some really great

01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:55.800
opportunities to make sure in this huge diverse state, more than 6.2 million students, that we

01:40:55.800 --> 01:41:02.120
hear from all 58 counties, that we hear from the diverse perspectives of urban, suburban, rural,

01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:07.000
and I think the students brought us a lot of really good ideas. So for this first presentation,

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:12.600
I just want to thank Benjamin and the team that put it together so articulate. Oh, excuse me,

01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:17.800
Member Rodriguez, I see your hand is up. Yes, Member Strauss, thank you. I wanted to speak earlier,

01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:24.520
but the mail showed up and the dogs were barking. Anyway, I just want to acknowledge, thank you for

01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:32.920
your presentation. And I have read this report with such delight. And as a teacher,

01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:41.560
I value student voice and parent voice tremendously. You know, and in this environment,

01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:46.760
I've asked, you know, one of the things, and this is actually another issue in this report,

01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:54.200
but going back to the representation, you know, as Member Rucker said, you know, what would this

01:41:54.200 --> 01:42:01.880
look like at the local level? And it would be, this is a great time to go back to President

01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:07.080
Darlene Hammond's comments at the beginning, right? What is this, how are we going to emerge from this

01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:13.160
and how is it going to be new? And I would really like to see student voice and vote, right? Because

01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:18.280
we have student members in a lot of different capacities, but I would like to have you be able

01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:26.520
to vote and to be responsible to your body of peers beyond ASB and, you know, beyond some of

01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:31.160
these programs that students are selected for because of their academics or what have you,

01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:38.360
but to really, you know, I think of the program Mosaic, making our schools an inclusive place,

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:44.360
but actually making California be, you know, where we bring a voice to a lot of different students

01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:49.800
who have the voting power. So thank you for this. This whole item is very exciting to me.

01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:51.800
Member Glover-Woods?

01:42:53.960 --> 01:43:00.600
Thank you, Vice President Straus, and again, I'd just like to say kudos to the idea and the thought

01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:07.320
of more increased student representation. Student voice is extremely, extremely important,

01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:15.720
and one thing that I just give to all of the phenomenal student leaders for ongoing consideration

01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:23.720
is how to best be sure that in that representation that the voice of all students are heard. I'm

01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:29.080
thinking in particular for students that might be a bit disenfranchised from school, might not be

01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:34.680
as successful in school. I'm sure these are conversations you've had in your settings as well,

01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:40.920
but to be sure that the voices of all students, including those that, again, might be

01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:47.320
disenfranchised with school or not as connected, that their voices are heard as well.

01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:53.000
Thank you, Member Glover-Woods. Are there any other board members that would like to make a

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:59.000
comment? We have six more areas, so we have lots of feedback to give our students as well. So at

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:06.200
this point, Diego, I'll turn over to the next section. Great, thank you so much. Next, we will

01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:16.360
have Anusha Athreya present on the topic of civic education. Thank you, Diego. I stand before you,

01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:22.040
the Board of Education, proposing a policy that would affect over 10,000 schools across California.

01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:27.800
Being 16 years old, I'm at an age that most adults regard as too young to care about these issues.

01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:32.360
The first time that I learned that I could pre-register to vote at 16 was before the

01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:38.600
2016 election in sixth grade. My history teacher, Ms. Nieres, used the entire class period to explain

01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:44.680
the electoral college and the impact on the election on us as students. I am lucky to have

01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:49.560
the opportunity to learn about my civic rights so early on, but the reality is that most students

01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:54.760
in California don't have the opportunity to engage in civic discussions in schools until late in high

01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:59.560
school, an issue that has stigmatized youth expression in civic leadership. My name is Anusha

01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:03.720
Athreya, and I'm a junior attending Archbishop Mitty High School in San Jose, California.

01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:07.240
On behalf of the Student Advisory Board of Education, we strongly recommend that the

01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:12.120
State Board of Education facilitate the creation and distribution of a digital student civic

01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:15.880
learning handbook, which would detail the ways in which a student could engage civically with

01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:21.320
their community with the goal of improving civic engagement amongst youth. Now more than ever,

01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:26.040
California students seek civic engagement and political discussions on a daily basis,

01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:30.680
and with the desire in young people to engage in their political realities becomes more evident

01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:35.480
with each passing day, so do the vast disparities that lie in regards to civic opportunity

01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:40.360
accessibility in marginalized communities. Furthermore, in Petaluma Unified School District,

01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:44.840
when the administration was pressed by students on how to participate civically, the district

01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:49.960
responded coldly and negatively. Students in districts across California are not aware of

01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:54.680
the opportunities for civic participation at their disposal, which includes organizations like

01:45:54.680 --> 01:46:01.000
CASC and student board members. We love having a voice, but most of the time, youth feel alienated

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:04.840
from the political discussion because it's assumed that we don't have the knowledge to engage in

01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:09.800
these conversations, especially in our current political climate. The presidential election was

01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:14.600
just two days ago, where a little bit more than 12 million Californians cast their vote for state

01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:19.000
ballot propositions, and many students are apprehensive about the future of our nation.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:23.240
With our entrance to voting approaching faster, it's a fundamental necessity that all students

01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:27.800
have the tools at their disposal to make their voices heard. We believe that the student civic

01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:31.720
learning handbook should include essential information needed to inform students to become

01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:36.360
a civically engaged member of society. With the State Board of Education creating a digital model

01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:41.400
handbook, this format can be passed down to local school districts and adapted within their specific

01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:46.440
policies. We propose this recommendation to be facilitated by a committee consisting of students,

01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:51.560
parents, teachers, school district administrators, and any other pertinent community members with

01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:57.000
steps taken towards distribution and accessibility for all students. A standardized STL handbook made

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:01.080
readily available to all students would create a culture in which students receive greater

01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:05.480
engagement in civic opportunities, such as voter registration, civic leadership, and understanding

01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:09.720
of policy language, thus greatly increasing accessibility and allowing previously marginalized

01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:13.880
communities to effectively use their voice. It's imperative to recognize the important role that

01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:18.520
civic education plays in the lives of students in California, and the current lack of quality

01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:23.160
in civic education has left many students without the tools to properly express and represent

01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:28.520
themselves. As a result, local education agencies miss out on the input of their primary stakeholders.

01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:32.920
Students, we acknowledge the board's decision to pass the state seal of civic engagement,

01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:36.760
which will incentivize high school students to expand their civic literacy, the requirements

01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:40.920
to learn about constitutional policies and democratic principles, and the STL handbook

01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:45.400
will only reinforce these ideals of civic engagement proposed within the state seal

01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:49.400
and provide students with a set of tools for when participating in political and legislative

01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:54.440
discussions. I am proud to be an advocate. I represent those who don't have the opportunity

01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:59.800
to be here today, and with the necessity of civic engagement in today's political atmosphere,

01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:04.520
everyone deserves an opportunity to be represented. For these reasons, we strongly suggest that the

01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:09.320
State Board of Education facilitate the creation and distribution of a student civic learning

01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:13.720
handbook so that California can make a significant change in our education system

01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:16.680
and empower all civically engaged students. Thank you.

01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:25.560
So we'll go to board member comments on the proposal for civic engagement and

01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:33.720
a handbook to support student activity. Do I have board members who would like, let's see,

01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:42.280
member Rucker, I see your hand up. Well, I see board member McQuillan's hand is up first. Maybe

01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:47.080
it might be more appropriate for him to speak before me. Okay. I think he was first. I think

01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:52.840
he put his hand up before I did. Okay, thanks. Sorry, I was going on the screen I saw. Member

01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:57.160
McQuillan, would you like to make a comment? Oh, just briefly, I just want to congratulate

01:48:57.160 --> 01:49:03.080
the students on their presentation, a great job, and I think this is a very important

01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:09.080
handbook recommendation that you've made. When you think of the schools all over California,

01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:15.000
they're kind of all over the map in terms of defining what civic engagement is, and it would

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:22.200
be very helpful to outline that for students, especially with the latest action we took with

01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:29.320
the seal of civic engagement that we approved a couple of meetings back, but good job and great

01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:34.600
presentation. Thank you. So member Rucker, and then after that, member Patio Bronson.

01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:41.160
Well, Ms. Anusha, I can't say your last name, so please accept my apology for addressing you by

01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:46.600
your first name instead. But I want to let you know, it's interesting, yesterday afternoon I

01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:52.120
had a conversation with a friend of mine. She's a high school English teacher in San Ramon,

01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:58.840
and we were talking about this very issue, and I mentioned to her that the board had approved the

01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:06.760
state seal of civic engagement for recognizing students in the local school community.

01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:13.640
Not only did she not know anything about the state seal, not only did she not know that her

01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:20.760
district could create the policy and craft the criteria for identifying students, but she also

01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:27.080
didn't know that it could include a whole variety of ways that students could be recognized

01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:34.120
for their civic engagement. So I think your idea is an excellent idea because it would actually make

01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:41.720
the basic premise that the board approved actually become a living activity and a living document

01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:47.480
for districts to look at and engage in. Not only would teachers become more aware that this

01:50:47.480 --> 01:50:52.680
opportunity exists to recognize a whole lot of ways that students are involved,

01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:58.440
not only in their school community, but involved in the community in general in civic ways.

01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:05.080
And so I think this is an excellent idea. Again, I want to applaud you as the presenter, but also

01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:10.200
your fellow members on your committee who participated in doing this work. And again,

01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:15.240
I see your names and I appreciate the thought that you put into this. This is an exciting

01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:22.920
opportunity for the board to see at the local level an idea brought to fruition in very creative

01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:30.360
and relevant ways for students just like you, but also as board member Glover Woods pointed out,

01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:35.480
for students who do not necessarily see themselves as members on a student council,

01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:41.560
but who do get engaged in other activities like Black Lives Matter or who do voter enrollment,

01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:46.840
voter registration, or I know a particular young lady who lives in Vallejo. She actually

01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:54.280
worked a poll, a voting poll on election day. And I think it's important to recognize that

01:51:54.280 --> 01:52:00.520
type of work as well. So thank you very much for this very, very thoughtful and creative idea.

01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:13.080
I also wanted to congratulate the group and Anusha on the excellent presentation. Clearly

01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:20.600
you all have thought about this and come up with something that is both actionable and realistic,

01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:25.400
and I really appreciate the presentation as well as all the hard work that went into it.

01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:34.760
As some of the board members had mentioned, we just recently passed this motion around the seal

01:52:34.760 --> 01:52:42.520
of civic engagement and it's very much our, I think, hope that that action will also provide

01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:49.000
additional sort of wind in the sails of exactly this type of effort so that LEAs, so school

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:55.000
districts and county offices of Ed will know that this is something that is both within

01:52:55.640 --> 01:53:00.600
their capacity but also something that is encouraged and something that for which students

01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:07.240
should be rewarded when they take initiative. I think as is often the case, sometimes it is

01:53:08.200 --> 01:53:15.720
happening in sort of pockets of excellence and then there are places where it is not happening at

01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:21.880
all. But this particularly two days after the election where we don't actually yet have a

01:53:21.880 --> 01:53:28.840
declared winner, there's really no better applied learning experience than right now. I can certainly

01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:34.680
attest to the fact that I've been watching all the electoral boards with my own children

01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:41.000
and in addition to sort of the civics learning part of the electoral college, I think my fifth

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:49.400
grader can now pick out Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia without the math names, which is a new

01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:54.280
and exciting part of sort of knowing how both the electoral college works but also a little

01:53:54.280 --> 01:54:00.120
bit of geography. But I just want to, again, commend you all on what is an excellent and

01:54:00.120 --> 01:54:05.320
well-thought-out idea and I hope that we can find a way to actually bring that to life.

01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:12.920
Thank you, Member Pratip Ronson. So Diego will move on now to the racial equity presentation.

01:54:13.640 --> 01:54:21.240
Great. Thank you so much for that. Next, we will have Eliane presenting a proposal on racial equity.

01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:28.280
Good morning, esteemed members of the California Board of Education. Just this March, some students

01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:32.600
from my school joked about staying six feet away from me in fear of contracting COVID-19.

01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:38.520
The matter of the fact is microaggressions like these aren't micro. As a Chinese American,

01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:43.800
as a Chinese American, I felt alienated and humiliated, but I invalidated my feelings and

01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:47.640
chose not to report it because I had been conditioned to think that getting upset over

01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:52.600
such remarks is overreacting. My name is Ellie Lian and I'm a sophomore from Portola High School

01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:57.560
in Orange County. I am one of more than four and a half million students of color in the California

01:54:57.560 --> 01:55:02.600
public school system and I'm one of the countless students affected by discrimination. Today, I'm

01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:07.000
speaking on behalf of my group covering racial inequity in the California education system.

01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:12.120
In light of recent racial justice movements, the urgency of equity has only been magnified.

01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:17.320
Students such as myself feel uncomfortable and even unsafe speaking upon racial experiences.

01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:23.560
In addition, many local educational agencies do not recognize the experiences of discrimination

01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:28.200
that students who are BIPOC, Black, Indigenous, and people of color have to go through. And as a

01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:33.000
result, no effective disciplinary actions are taken. We need to create an environment where all

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:39.320
students feel safe to learn and thrive regardless of cultural background. In recent years, there has

01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:43.800
been an increasing attentiveness to discrimination on campus and there has been legislation passed

01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:48.840
in efforts to address this matter. Although this is a step in the right direction, FBI data shows

01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:55.800
that since 2018, hate crimes on campuses have actually increased by 25% and due to recent racial

01:55:55.800 --> 01:56:01.720
justice debates and COVID-19, the racial inequity has only been aggravated on our campuses. We heard

01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:06.760
stories from Tesoro High School where a French teacher called a black girl a monkey with no

01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:11.080
disciplinary action taken. We heard stories from Annaleigh High School where a student of color

01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:16.440
was told by educators she had little chance to attend college despite her strong academic

01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:21.720
performance. These are our students going to school on our campuses whose experiences were

01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:26.680
largely ignored because they had little confidence and their schools had believed to listen or

01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:31.240
administration failed to follow through with consequences. These students reflect a small

01:56:31.240 --> 01:56:37.000
sample of a large number of BIPOC students whose experiences are repeatedly invalidated and downplayed

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:41.960
and therefore are unheard, unknown, and underrepresented. In response to this, we

01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:46.760
use insight from students of all backgrounds and experiences to create a holistic solution that

01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:53.160
follows the footsteps of AB9, also known as Seth's Law, a legislation passed in 2011 that requires

01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:58.440
the state superintendent to provide anti-discrimination resources for LEAs, intervention

01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:03.240
from school staff who witness acts of racism, and student accessibility to procedures and policies

01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:08.680
for handling discrimination. Our solution calls for the California Department of Education and the

01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:13.000
state superintendent of public instruction to develop and encourage the use of a blueprint

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:17.640
consisting of effective methods that provide comfortable and accessible ways for students to

01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:22.120
report racially charged incidents and then encourages the use of restorative disciplinary

01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:28.120
action. The proposal requires superintendent Thurman to instruct the task force on safe schools

01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:32.840
to design a blueprint of practices for reporting incidents of racism and complete subsequent

01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:38.120
research to formulate this model. We also suggest holding surveys for students in regards to this

01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:42.600
model as well as including student student representatives so that all stakeholders,

01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:47.480
including students, are represented in this task force. After development is complete,

01:57:47.480 --> 01:57:52.600
Superintendent Thurman will distribute it to school districts and local educational agencies

01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:57.480
along with the other resources he has to provide under AB9. We recognize the great work you all

01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:01.480
have already done and greatly appreciate the effort that has been taken to make this pressing

01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:07.080
issue a priority. So while there may be some costs required for funding research and expert opinions

01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:11.880
from the racial equity field, the established platform we already have to build off of means

01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:16.280
that the development for procedures related to racially targeted incidents will require minimal

01:58:16.280 --> 01:58:20.840
costs. This means that the benefits of this policy will greatly outweigh its economic exertion.

01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:26.600
The positive change that AB9 has brought so far also supports the liability to our method.

01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:31.160
Since its implementation, a grand jury report that examined bullying from Marin County showed

01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:36.680
that 25 schools have taken their own initiative to launch various methods such as anonymous

01:58:36.680 --> 01:58:42.040
tip lines, surveys, and forums for students to vocalize these incidents for investigation.

01:58:42.600 --> 01:58:46.680
Many have even implemented restorative justice practices such as peer courts counseling

01:58:46.680 --> 01:58:52.440
and peer mediation. Our proposal is simply in addition to AB9 that increases accessibility

01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:57.800
and guidelines for school districts. By providing students a safe and proper platform to be heard,

01:58:57.800 --> 01:59:01.960
schools will be able to directly gauge the experiences of its BIPOC students,

01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:06.840
thus instigating a sense of urgency within schools towards racial equity and equality.

01:59:07.400 --> 01:59:11.560
Once racial offenses hold consequences, BIPOC students will be validated,

01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:16.040
improving not only the school climate but also actively dismantling the normalization of racism.

01:59:16.600 --> 01:59:17.080
Thank you.

01:59:20.840 --> 01:59:25.400
Thank you, Ellie, so much. So board members, you want to put your hands up? And I just would

01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:30.920
say to member Rodriguez, I apologize. I think your hand went up just as we were transitioning. So

01:59:30.920 --> 01:59:35.160
I'll call on you first and see if that's and then member Rucker right after that.

01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:39.000
Okay, and I didn't want to interrupt because the new the presentation really had started

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:46.040
speaking. And so I didn't want to jump in there. But thank you. And so I'm actually going to speak

01:59:46.040 --> 01:59:55.080
on what you said. And thank you so much for your your your your authentic. It wasn't just like a

01:59:55.080 --> 02:00:02.760
report. It was very personal. And I appreciated hearing that very much. But going to the civic

02:00:02.760 --> 02:00:09.880
engagement, that's right up my alley, because I've been the mock trial coach and have had mock

02:00:09.880 --> 02:00:16.920
elections. And I know that there, there are a lot of things in place for civic engagement.

02:00:16.920 --> 02:00:24.520
But a lot of times, it's for students who are competitive. And so it doesn't really include

02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:31.080
students who need to learn civic engagement, to be able to access their rights and know when

02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:38.520
their rights are being violated. I had the opportunity through street law to meet the

02:00:38.520 --> 02:00:45.240
founder of mock trial. And he moved to Washington to work in urban schools, because he was really

02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:52.520
disappointed at the way in California, it had become so elitist and so competitive. And, and

02:00:52.520 --> 02:01:00.200
it was missing the point of having all students learn their rights, learn how to navigate the

02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:07.560
court system, learn about Supreme Court cases, etc. I think with No Child Left Behind, when we

02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:13.160
started looking at math and English language, history and civics just sort of if it wasn't

02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:19.080
being tested, it was being ignored. And I remember having a conversation with former president Mike

02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:26.040
Hurst, about how he wanted to see civics in every single grade at some level every teacher. So it

02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:31.960
brings me back to the systemic thing. If it's an additive approach, it's probably not going to

02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:38.200
happen. Because we have so much on our plates already at the practitioner level, that it really

02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:45.240
needs to be woven into everything that we do. And with that comes teacher preparation and teacher

02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:50.680
awareness, right? How to listen without judgment. If a student is politically saying something that

02:01:50.680 --> 02:01:56.920
I disagree with, how do I not shut that down, right? And those are skills that we have to learn,

02:01:56.920 --> 02:02:04.680
because unfortunately, you know, it goes into the next point about BIPOC students and that feeling

02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:11.960
of, because I know what that's like. I absolutely know what it's like to be in a place and to look

02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:20.200
around and feel powerless, feel powerless because of my race, because of my language of origin,

02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:28.120
right? So I know what that's like. And there are, as I was reading, as I was reading the report,

02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:36.280
and read about Seth's law that you mentioned here, I actually asked about 30 teachers that I know,

02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:41.240
excellent teachers throughout California, if they were familiar with Seth's law, and nobody was.

02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:46.920
And so it made me wonder, like, what are we not communicating to the people that are actually,

02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:56.440
you know, working? And it's not because, I mean, these are teachers who are on top of policy,

02:02:56.440 --> 02:03:03.080
on top of, you know, a lot of, they stay relevant and really care about kids. And they're not teachers

02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:10.440
who bully students either or would accept that. So I was surprised to know that that information

02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:17.400
isn't in the hands of the practitioner. And that's what we need to do to make this just so

02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:27.000
that it's such part of our mindset that we're not, you know, that we've inculcated. And

02:03:28.040 --> 02:03:36.040
I believe that the standards for teacher preparation include the new standards that,

02:03:36.520 --> 02:03:43.320
you know, for the last three, four years include a lot of this inclusion. But we still need to

02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:50.840
do more. So I really appreciate your advocacy. And I want to see this become an integral part

02:03:50.840 --> 02:03:53.080
of our classrooms and our schools. So thank you.

02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:57.960
Thank you, Member Rodriguez. So Member Rucker and following Member Rucker, Member Glover-Woods.

02:03:59.320 --> 02:04:04.520
Ms. Leon, I'm going to begin with an unusual request and ask if you would please

02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:09.960
read the names of all of the students who work with you in your committee on this project. Would

02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:16.520
you please read them aloud if you have that information? Yes. Give me a second to pull that

02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:23.080
up really quickly. Okay. So while you're pulling that up, let me just say it's, this is a very

02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:29.160
personal issue for me. For the years and all the years that I have been on the board, I have never

02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:37.480
heard anyone so articulately state the issue of microaggressions in the way that you and your team

02:04:37.480 --> 02:04:42.680
have done. Let me say that first of all. And I would like to say, and I would like to pretend

02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:48.200
that we live in a world where people grow up and learn not to do that. But the same issues of

02:04:48.200 --> 02:04:55.160
microaggressions that you identified so personally in your story are the same issues that I'm sure

02:04:55.160 --> 02:05:03.320
all of your peers who are here this week have also dealt with, but also we watch as adults

02:05:03.320 --> 02:05:08.520
engage in the same behaviors. I have, I personally have encountered and dealt with those same

02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:15.080
behaviors and being a public figure, I am very careful how I choose to enact or react to those

02:05:15.080 --> 02:05:21.080
things because probably one of the most dangerous microaggressions that I have to deal with is being

02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:27.000
labeled as an angry black woman. So I truly do appreciate what you have stated, what you have

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:33.480
offered here as an idea. And it is, it has been my personal campaign as a member on this board to

02:05:33.480 --> 02:05:38.360
address this, not just because of the issue of bullying. This is a board that has committed

02:05:38.360 --> 02:05:45.080
itself to addressing the issues of what it means to close the achievement gap. This is the one issue

02:05:45.080 --> 02:05:51.240
that remains unnamed on all of our agenda and all of our activities and all of the things that we

02:05:51.240 --> 02:05:57.000
have attempted to pay attention to. We talk all the time about equity. We talk all the time and

02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:02.760
look at and call attention to the gap in performance among our students, in particular with ethnic

02:06:02.760 --> 02:06:09.560
minority subgroups and with particular concern to the over-identification of African American

02:06:09.560 --> 02:06:15.400
boys in being referred to special education. But the fact of the matter is the issue of

02:06:15.400 --> 02:06:20.760
microaggressions and the problems that are caused by the students who have to deal with that is a

02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:26.040
key and significant factor of why there is an achievement gap and why many students do feel

02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:31.320
disenfranchised in their schools and their communities. So I want to thank you for being

02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:36.520
willing and being brave to draw attention to this. And that's the reason why I want to make sure I

02:06:36.520 --> 02:06:42.920
ask you to identify the name of your colleagues who participated in developing this project. So

02:06:42.920 --> 02:06:47.960
I'll pause here and ask you to read your names aloud if you have it now. All right, there's

02:06:47.960 --> 02:06:55.960
Katherine Xu, Stephanie Hu, Kamiya Tofi Rad, Jennifer Cruden, Raina Bakhnakhan, Max Ramirez,

02:06:56.920 --> 02:07:08.440
Resendez Vicladina Hernandez, Lamis Yassin, and the counselor is David Ching and the research

02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:16.120
committee is Estrella Pacheco. So thank you very much and I want to give my personal thanks

02:07:16.120 --> 02:07:21.080
and appreciation to each of the students that you name. And what I can promise you here sitting here

02:07:21.160 --> 02:07:27.560
today is whether for the entire, for the balance of my tenure on the board and even when I leave

02:07:27.560 --> 02:07:32.760
the board and in all my other personal and professional endeavors, I will do my best to

02:07:32.760 --> 02:07:37.960
make sure the things that you proposed here are things that we can make a reality. Thank you so

02:07:37.960 --> 02:07:44.520
very much. Thank you. Sorry, I would really quickly like to mention that the writer of this proposal

02:07:44.520 --> 02:07:50.680
is Erin Tack. Sorry, I missed her. Okay, thank you so much. Member Glover Woods.

02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:58.040
Thank you and Ellie, I first would like to just applaud you for the very personal way that you

02:07:58.040 --> 02:08:04.760
started your report and many of my fellow board members have spoken. I'm not going to elongate

02:08:04.760 --> 02:08:10.360
the time so we can get into some of the other areas, but I just want to underscore how important

02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:18.200
the recommendation that you have shared with us really is. We have ongoing conversations about

02:08:18.200 --> 02:08:25.640
equity in the field of education. In almost any form you go into, equity has become the word that

02:08:25.640 --> 02:08:33.720
is utilized. We spend a lot of conversation and time looking at how do we expand our curriculum?

02:08:33.720 --> 02:08:40.600
How do we be sure that the lived experiences of people of color are really told in the various

02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:47.640
content areas? But your proposal and the proposal of your colleagues is so critical because all of

02:08:47.640 --> 02:08:55.320
that conversations about equity, diversifying the curriculum, all of that falls flat if students are

02:08:55.320 --> 02:09:02.200
dealing with microaggressions as they are on a regular basis on campus. And Ellie, you stated

02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:07.880
it so eloquently when you said microaggressions are not micro. They are not. They are the things

02:09:07.880 --> 02:09:15.240
that impact what a student's experience will be on campus from day to day and how they're able to

02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:21.480
either be set up for success or not set up for success because of the environment that is created

02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:28.600
for them. So to have something convened to be able to look at what those best practices and

02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:36.600
model practices are so that when racial microaggressions are taking place on campus

02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:43.400
by students, by teachers, we want to be sure that there is a way that students can communicate

02:09:44.040 --> 02:09:49.240
what they are experiencing and what is happening to them. And I really think that again this

02:09:49.240 --> 02:09:55.960
recommendation helps to put some meat on the bones of all of the other conversations we have in

02:09:55.960 --> 02:10:02.040
education around equity and diversifying the curriculum. So again, I applaud you for speaking

02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:07.320
on behalf of your colleagues. Kudos to Member Rucker for having the names that those students

02:10:07.320 --> 02:10:16.440
read aloud for this purpose. And I do hope we do some further exploration into how this recommendation

02:10:16.440 --> 02:10:23.800
can come to fruition. Thank you, Member Lover Woods. Diego, I'll turn it over to you for the

02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:32.200
next section which follows this. Thank you. Okay, so next up we have the topic of school safety

02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:38.360
presented by William Hin. Good morning Superintendent Thurmond, President Darling Hammond, and esteemed

02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:42.920
board members. My name is William Hin and I'm a senior attending San Diego High School in the

02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:47.160
Garden Grove Unified School District where I proudly serve as a School District Student Board

02:10:47.160 --> 02:10:53.160
Representative. On behalf of the Student Advisory Board on Education, we strongly advise the State

02:10:53.160 --> 02:10:59.160
Board of Education to recommend and set guidelines for local education agencies to establish various

02:10:59.160 --> 02:11:04.200
methods for students to communicate to local administration their safety concerns such as

02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:09.080
sexual harassment, staff misconduct, and possession of dangerous substances and weapons.

02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:13.560
And that these student voices be taken into account when schools execute campus-wide safety

02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:19.080
initiatives. Last year on her walk to school, my friend's backpack was grabbed by a strange van

02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:23.320
who asked her where she was going. Terrified, she broke away and ran to her school campus.

02:11:23.880 --> 02:11:29.000
Shaken, she reported the situation to her school administration but instead of being comforted,

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:33.400
she was sent straight to her school resource officer. The SRO terrified her by questioning

02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:38.680
and recording her without her permission. That day my friend experienced two uncomfortable situations.

02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:43.960
If she was able to express her discomfort, the administration would understand how to improve.

02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:50.520
When schools lack student input on school safety, the systems in place put the mental and physical

02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:56.040
safety of students at risk. In a discussion between 10 students from distinct and diverse

02:11:56.040 --> 02:12:00.920
regions of California, each person felt that student input was not acknowledged sufficiently

02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:07.320
in creating and enforcing school safety. This was mirrored in the observations we had of school

02:12:07.320 --> 02:12:12.280
administrators failing to recognize the value of the student perspective. One notable example

02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:16.120
occurred at a school in Chula Vista where there was an armed robbery at a school nearby.

02:12:16.680 --> 02:12:21.240
Yes, students were unable to enter the school because of premature action and lack of procedures.

02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:26.680
We understand these situations happen, but without consideration of the student perspective,

02:12:26.680 --> 02:12:30.360
school safety guidelines can create an uncomfortable and in some cases,

02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:34.360
blatantly unsafe learning environment where the feelings of students are discredited.

02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:38.840
While we recognize that there are pre-existing channels where students can provide their

02:12:38.840 --> 02:12:43.000
perspective, we believe students need more accessible outlets in order to communicate

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:48.280
safety concerns to administration at each school site. We are not proposing the creation of new

02:12:48.280 --> 02:12:53.000
measures. We are suggesting researches on campus where students are able to voice their safety

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:58.360
concerns and have their perspectives taken into account by administration. For instance,

02:12:58.360 --> 02:13:03.000
at a school site level, we propose the implementation of anonymous tip lines where students can

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:08.200
immediately express any pressing issues such as bullying, sexual harassment, teacher misconduct,

02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:13.960
and other potential safety risks. At a school in Garden Grove, this type of tip line was established

02:13:13.960 --> 02:13:17.960
and made easily accessible through the school's website and wasn't printed on every student's

02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:23.240
ID card. In one instance, this tip line was used after school to inform the administration

02:13:23.240 --> 02:13:26.840
that a student was threatening to bring a gun on campus the following day,

02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:29.880
which allowed the police to apprehend the student the next morning.

02:13:30.920 --> 02:13:35.400
Student voices could also be taken into account at a district level through district board meetings

02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:39.800
where students have the time to publicly share their concerns or experiences regarding campus

02:13:39.800 --> 02:13:45.240
safety. While these are only some recommendations from our complete proposal based on our research

02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:51.320
and as a delegation of stakeholders in the system, these precautions are what we need to see implemented.

02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:56.760
The proposal we provide you with today will give students a multitude of platforms to express

02:13:56.760 --> 02:14:02.040
their own perspectives to enforce and improve site safety. Consequently, the proposal would

02:14:02.040 --> 02:14:07.240
promote a greater sense of protection on campus, enhancing learning engagement, and thus decreasing

02:14:07.240 --> 02:14:13.400
chronic absenteeism among students that feel unsafe at school. I stand before you today to

02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:18.760
alleviate many fears students face within the California education system. California embodies

02:14:18.760 --> 02:14:24.040
more than six million students who face distinct situations that need to be addressed immediately

02:14:24.040 --> 02:14:30.360
in order to provide a safe learning environment. Because we, the students, are the primary

02:14:30.360 --> 02:14:35.400
stakeholders of the education system, our viewpoint will be the most truthful when reflecting the

02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:41.480
prevailing issues of our system safety measures. Therefore, we advise the State Board of Education

02:14:41.480 --> 02:14:47.480
to recommend guidelines for local education agencies to establish various methods for

02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:53.240
students to communicate local safety concerns and that these student voices be taken into account

02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:58.760
when schools execute campus-wide safety initiatives. Thank you. Thank you so much,

02:14:58.760 --> 02:15:03.480
William. So I'll look for Board members who want to make some feedback comments on the

02:15:03.480 --> 02:15:10.760
school safety proposal. Member McQuillan. Great job, William. Very succinct, very good presentation.

02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:16.760
I want to thank you and your team for the research and this very valuable presentation.

02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:24.680
You know, we know systems that allow a lot of feedback and return of information within that

02:15:24.680 --> 02:15:30.360
system are more healthier systems. So your recommendations are right on point as well as

02:15:30.360 --> 02:15:37.320
the last presentation and giving a stronger and additional avenues for students to give feedback

02:15:37.320 --> 02:15:43.720
to the systems that serve them. So very good and thank you. So I'll ask if there are any other

02:15:43.720 --> 02:15:50.440
Board member comments on the school safety proposal. I'm looking at the hands raised,

02:15:51.080 --> 02:16:01.880
trying not to miss anybody. I do want to say to the students who presented on this presentation,

02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:09.800
on this topic, this is a really important topic close to our heart, especially as school

02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:16.600
and district leaders and state leaders. And I think your suggestions to make it safe for students

02:16:16.680 --> 02:16:22.280
to be able to report, to feel comfortable when they're really uncomfortable and talking to staff

02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:26.440
and the suggestions of what some of your districts have done to already address that will really

02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:31.720
help as we share that in the state. And I just would say if students aren't safe, they can't be

02:16:31.720 --> 02:16:37.800
engaged in learning. And we know there are so many things, especially some of our schools are really

02:16:37.800 --> 02:16:42.200
large. I know the school I was high school principal had 3,500 students. You can't know all

02:16:42.200 --> 02:16:48.520
that stuff. So you have to create safe avenues and safe ways for a variety of different reporting.

02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:53.640
And also I think sensitivity to staff so they're aware of that, both the certificated staff and

02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:57.880
the classified, the school resource officers. So again, William, you and your team brought up

02:16:57.880 --> 02:17:03.400
important issues and I know we take those seriously at the state board level and at the

02:17:03.400 --> 02:17:08.600
Department of In. Well, thank you very, very much. I'm going to turn it over to Diego for the next

02:17:09.560 --> 02:17:16.200
report on mental health. Great, yes. So the next topic will be mental health and it will be presented

02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:23.080
by Karina Pan. Good morning Superintendent Thurman, President Darling-Hammond and esteemed members of

02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:27.400
the board. My name is Karina Pan and I'm a junior at Temple City High School. I am here to speak

02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:31.720
about the pressing issue of mental health instability in children and youth across California,

02:17:31.720 --> 02:17:36.920
especially given the current situation of COVID-19. We propose that schools use informational posters

02:17:36.920 --> 02:17:41.080
to educate the students about topics regarding mental health, including guidelines to approach

02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:45.560
specific aspects of mental health decline and both nationwide and district-specific resources

02:17:45.560 --> 02:17:49.880
that students can go to for help. These posters shall include safe plans in the event of a mental

02:17:49.880 --> 02:17:54.040
health crisis, positive coping mechanisms, and the identification of school-based services that

02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:59.160
students can utilize for social and emotional support. We can continue to invest in services

02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:03.320
like counseling and peer groups, but they will be useless unless students are informed about them.

02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:06.440
We recognize that the state has already made efforts to increase the mental well-being of

02:18:06.440 --> 02:18:10.680
students. However, declining mental health is still a very real problem for students in California

02:18:10.680 --> 02:18:15.160
and across the nation. The stark reality is that mental health is one of the most pressing issues

02:18:15.160 --> 02:18:20.680
that students face today. Between 2008 and 2018, there was a 38 percent increase of hospital

02:18:20.680 --> 02:18:25.640
discharges for mental health issues among California youth ages 5 to 19. The rate of suicide

02:18:25.640 --> 02:18:31.960
among those aged 10 to 24 increased nearly 60 percent between 2007 and 2018. Every one in five

02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:36.840
teenagers live with a mental health condition. Even worse, during this COVID-19 pandemic, 29

02:18:36.840 --> 02:18:41.000
percent of children and youth are facing mental health declines. Many students know someone that

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:44.760
has suffered from a mental illness, and the youth that worked on this proposal are no exception.

02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:48.200
Personally, I've experienced declining mental health, struggle with suicidal thoughts, and I

02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:52.200
was once diagnosed with mild depression. Unfortunately, like most students in California,

02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:56.760
I did not learn of any resources to combat my intense mental health struggles. I felt alone in

02:18:56.760 --> 02:19:00.920
my battle, and I didn't know where to reach out to for help. This is a situation that no one should

02:19:00.920 --> 02:19:05.400
ever have to face, let alone vulnerable children and teenagers. If I had seen resources and

02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:09.400
information about where to seek help around school like the one we present today, I would have known

02:19:09.400 --> 02:19:14.040
how to respond to my struggles. Thankfully, through reaching out to my friends and receiving therapy,

02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:18.600
I was able to overcome my mental health obstacle. But this is not the experience for all students

02:19:18.600 --> 02:19:22.600
in California, which is why we are proposing these posters to help other students get the help that

02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:27.560
they need. In our ideal education system, all students have easy access to adequate support

02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:31.560
and mental health resources. All staff and students are educated on how to recognize symptoms

02:19:31.560 --> 02:19:35.480
of declining mental health, and the student body as a whole does not promote negative stigma around

02:19:35.480 --> 02:19:39.640
asking for mental health support. We acknowledge that declining mental health is multifaceted

02:19:39.640 --> 02:19:43.880
and complicated, and that there are important steps that we need to take to combat this issue.

02:19:43.880 --> 02:19:47.800
One significant leap in the right direction would be for the California State Board of Education to

02:19:47.800 --> 02:19:51.960
strongly encourage districts to create and publicize informational posters about issues

02:19:51.960 --> 02:19:55.640
pertaining to mental health. When students return to in-person learning, posters will be put up

02:19:55.640 --> 02:19:59.960
around campus. However, if students are continuing online learning, a digital version of the poster

02:19:59.960 --> 02:20:04.040
should be put up on school websites, emailed to students, and posted on school social media pages

02:20:04.040 --> 02:20:08.040
like Instagram and Facebook, so students will be encouraged to refer back to them and will regularly

02:20:08.040 --> 02:20:12.280
review the information. Our proposal will be effective because these students will educate

02:20:12.280 --> 02:20:16.440
students, make them feel heard, and encourage them to reach out for help. Because posters are

02:20:16.440 --> 02:20:21.000
engaging and 65% of people are visual learners, children and youth are more likely to absorb

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:25.320
information from them rather than listening to a long lecture or a speech. Additionally,

02:20:25.320 --> 02:20:29.560
they are accessible to many students at once and can create a larger impact in a shorter amount of

02:20:29.560 --> 02:20:33.480
time. It is essential for students to have easily accessible and appealing information because

02:20:33.480 --> 02:20:38.440
students' long-term academic success is directly affected by their mental health, further emphasizing

02:20:38.440 --> 02:20:42.600
the fact that mental health decline is one of the most pressing issues that students face today.

02:20:43.240 --> 02:20:47.640
Increasing sadness or hopelessness among students was related to subsequent declines in gains in

02:20:47.640 --> 02:20:51.960
test scores in reading, language, and math. High school students who screen positive for

02:20:51.960 --> 02:20:55.960
psychosocial dysfunction have three times the absentee and tardy rates than those without,

02:20:55.960 --> 02:21:00.120
and high school students with significant symptoms of depression are more than twice as likely to

02:21:00.120 --> 02:21:04.280
drop out compared to their peers. Not only does declining mental health impact test scores, but it

02:21:04.280 --> 02:21:08.680
also increases the chance that a student will not attend school. If declining mental health is not

02:21:08.680 --> 02:21:13.880
directly addressed using a proposal like ours, it will be impossible to increase the success rate of

02:21:13.880 --> 02:21:18.440
students in California. So please prioritize the mental well-being of students by strongly

02:21:18.440 --> 02:21:23.080
encouraging districts to produce and spread informational posters regarding mental health.

02:21:23.080 --> 02:21:28.680
Thank you for your time and your consideration. Well, Karina, thank you for the presentation for

02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:33.880
your committee and for the passion and energy that you gave to giving us some very specific

02:21:33.880 --> 02:21:39.320
suggestions of what we should think about as we all really focus on the mental health support for

02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:44.920
all of our students. I'll ask some state board members now if anybody would like to make a comment.

02:21:45.560 --> 02:21:46.360
Member Malvo.

02:21:50.040 --> 02:21:55.960
Yeah, I just want to thank you for this. As well as William prior, I didn't have an opportunity

02:21:55.960 --> 02:22:02.360
to thank you both for speaking on safety and Karina on the social emotional mental health.

02:22:02.360 --> 02:22:08.920
This is a huge issue and one of the striking statistics that you as pointed out in your

02:22:09.560 --> 02:22:19.480
report is that the leading cause of death for students ages 10 to age 34 suicide. And I think

02:22:21.320 --> 02:22:28.760
local educators are struggling with this and the idea that students need to be comfortable

02:22:28.760 --> 02:22:33.720
and we all need to be comfortable asking for support and asking for help is a huge issue.

02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:40.920
So I commend you on this and I would challenge your team to think of more than the posters

02:22:40.920 --> 02:22:47.640
and the information that we can do more in this area. And I would think I would challenge your

02:22:47.640 --> 02:22:56.920
team to think to think more, be more intrusive and more disruptive with the system when it comes to

02:22:56.920 --> 02:23:03.240
elevating the urgency around mental health. But I thank you for this. It's incredibly

02:23:03.960 --> 02:23:10.200
powerful. I loved the way you elevated the significance of this. As it's dear to my heart,

02:23:10.200 --> 02:23:17.080
I know dear to many board members. This is an issue for our youth. It's incredibly challenging.

02:23:17.080 --> 02:23:20.520
So thank you. Thank you, member Malvo. Member McQuillan.

02:23:20.520 --> 02:23:27.400
I just want to congratulate you on a great presentation, very succinct, and taking the

02:23:27.400 --> 02:23:31.960
recommendations that were made earlier this week and integrating those into your presentation.

02:23:32.760 --> 02:23:39.000
Very valuable information that we all need to think about right now with the times we're in,

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:46.280
the crisis of the pandemic, and the need to get those resources out to our students, you know,

02:23:46.600 --> 02:23:53.400
in multiple avenues that you brought up, the posters that can be posted on social media

02:23:53.960 --> 02:24:01.960
or on the student ID cards. I think those are wonderful ideas. And we need to follow up on this

02:24:01.960 --> 02:24:09.000
and get that out to all districts and all schools. So very good. And thank you for this presentation.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:15.560
Thank you very much. Thank you, board member McQuillan. So we have our final area, Diego,

02:24:15.640 --> 02:24:18.600
environmental sustainability. Would you introduce our presenter?

02:24:20.120 --> 02:24:24.520
We actually have two more. First, we have distance learning presented by David Kim.

02:24:25.320 --> 02:24:29.240
And then we'll be moving on. I'm sorry. I apologize. No worries.

02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:39.720
Just one second. Before we present on distance learning, David Kim, member Rodriguez wanted to

02:24:39.720 --> 02:24:44.280
make a comment on mental health. So I apologize. I didn't see her hand up. So just hold on one

02:24:44.280 --> 02:24:53.560
second. Thank you so much. And also, I'd like to echo what's already been said. Great presentation.

02:24:55.000 --> 02:25:02.600
This is a very pressing issue as I'm dealing with students who are very depressed right now,

02:25:03.480 --> 02:25:09.080
suicidal. And fortunately for me, they feel comfortable to reach out to me.

02:25:10.040 --> 02:25:19.640
But I'd like to echo what board member Navo said, that posters are nice. They add a level of

02:25:19.640 --> 02:25:27.080
awareness. But we have to go deep into how are we handling the social emotional learning in our

02:25:27.080 --> 02:25:34.440
classrooms? What are we as teachers doing to bring those conversations and take the shame away?

02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:41.640
You know, because on the one hand, I have students who are very competitive. And it's great to see

02:25:41.640 --> 02:25:47.960
them go and participate. But they put so much pressure on themselves that they're in my

02:25:47.960 --> 02:25:54.040
classroom pulling their hair out, literally pulling their hair out because they're struggling so much.

02:25:54.040 --> 02:26:02.120
And then on the other hand, my foster students who have so many issues that we need to create

02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:09.320
spaces at school. And I'll bring back mock trial, truth and reconciliation, things that,

02:26:09.320 --> 02:26:15.400
you know, where we can bring all of the students in so that they can use those skills. And as

02:26:15.400 --> 02:26:23.560
teachers, we can also facilitate that closeness as human beings. So I do encourage you to push this

02:26:24.280 --> 02:26:29.960
further than the posters and let's make it systemic so that we have a lot of nets in place so that

02:26:29.960 --> 02:26:34.360
when students are falling, we catch them along the way and we don't let them slip through.

02:26:35.400 --> 02:26:40.360
Thank you, member Rodriguez. So we're going to hear from David Kim presenting the proposal

02:26:40.360 --> 02:26:45.480
on distance learning so relevant to the work we're doing today for all students. So David,

02:26:45.480 --> 02:26:47.480
we're looking forward to hearing from you and your committee.

02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:54.600
Good morning, board members. My name is David Kim, and I'm a senior at Lincoln High School in

02:26:54.600 --> 02:26:59.000
Stockton. We, the Student Advisory Board on Education, recommend that the State Board of

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:05.240
Education convene a distance learning task force composed of students, teachers, administration,

02:27:05.240 --> 02:27:09.480
and parents dedicated to improving distance learning and the transition back to traditional

02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:15.320
learning models. Though the California Association of Student Councils meets annually with the Board

02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:20.600
of Education in person, we are speaking to you today amid one of the largest crises in the history

02:27:20.600 --> 02:27:25.880
of public education. COVID-19 has drastically changed the way schools across the state of

02:27:25.880 --> 02:27:31.960
California operate. However, it hasn't changed the mission of equity, dedication to a high-quality

02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:37.080
public education that the state of California promises. I'm speaking with you today as I face

02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:41.800
the challenges that distance learning has brought forth, but I'm also speaking with you today with

02:27:41.800 --> 02:27:46.760
a computer, a support system outside of school, and the ability to be successful by virtue of

02:27:46.760 --> 02:27:52.520
the opportunities that I've been given. These personal experiences, from being able to actively

02:27:52.520 --> 02:27:57.960
participate in hearings like these to accidentally being kicked out of my Zoom meeting for my calculus

02:27:57.960 --> 02:28:03.080
class, have defined my outlook on distance learning and have reminded me that we must ensure the voices

02:28:03.080 --> 02:28:08.680
of every student are heard. The vastly different experiences of students across California and the

02:28:08.680 --> 02:28:14.840
United States are all indicative of an underlying issue. In many cases, students, administration,

02:28:14.920 --> 02:28:18.760
and school boards lack input and communication amongst themselves,

02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:23.320
prompting school districts to bring forth solutions that aren't beneficial for student learning.

02:28:24.440 --> 02:28:29.240
Distance learning has emphasized the inequities that many students were faced with in traditional

02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:35.160
learning models. Just over half of parents at 54 percent feel that California schools in general

02:28:35.160 --> 02:28:40.680
are somewhat or very unprepared to offer distance learning. 79 percent of parents say that keeping

02:28:40.680 --> 02:28:45.880
children motivated and sustaining their interests are their biggest challenges. In turn, students

02:28:45.880 --> 02:28:50.840
report weaker understanding of curriculum, as seen as Shasta Union High School District, which has

02:28:50.840 --> 02:28:56.200
reported a record number of deficiencies given out in the first quarter. Students watch firsthand as

02:28:56.200 --> 02:29:01.000
their education falls short to work for them in these circumstances, yet by implementing student

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:06.600
voice, this issue could be mitigated. In such cases like mental health, student input is essential.

02:29:06.600 --> 02:29:11.320
At Fremont Unified School District, the superintendent instituted a student-oriented

02:29:11.320 --> 02:29:16.200
task force dedicated to finding solutions to address mental health concerns. This initiative

02:29:16.200 --> 02:29:22.120
was successful in its effective collection and mobilization of student input to create a solution

02:29:22.120 --> 02:29:29.320
that directly benefited those involved. The future is increasingly becoming digital whether COVID is

02:29:29.320 --> 02:29:33.960
going to be present or not, and student voice is essential in this new era of education.

02:29:34.680 --> 02:29:39.400
As such, the Student Advisory Board on Education proposes that the superintendent of public

02:29:39.400 --> 02:29:44.360
instruction facilitate the creation of a multi-stakeholder task force that serves

02:29:44.360 --> 02:29:50.440
to voice the opinions of students on multiple aspects of distance learning. Through the work

02:29:50.440 --> 02:29:55.800
of the Board of Education, you've helped bridge the digital divide. Now it's the fall and we're

02:29:55.800 --> 02:30:00.440
halfway into the semester. It's time for us to come together, check in, and work collectively

02:30:00.440 --> 02:30:05.800
towards future progress. A task force can effectively compile the data across the state

02:30:05.800 --> 02:30:11.160
and recommend participating members to disseminate best practices to local district administration.

02:30:11.720 --> 02:30:16.920
The appointment of members on the identified task force incurs minimal cost due to the accessibility

02:30:16.920 --> 02:30:22.680
and flexibility of an online platform. Therefore, the actions of the task force may produce a

02:30:22.680 --> 02:30:28.120
financial dependency, however the task force itself will not. By connecting students from across

02:30:28.120 --> 02:30:32.440
California with different backgrounds, we can bridge the gap between students and the problems

02:30:32.440 --> 02:30:37.240
they face. We must ensure the validity of student voice and distance learning so that the next time

02:30:37.240 --> 02:30:43.080
we undergo a global pandemic, we'll be ready. Thank you. David, thank you so much. What a relevant

02:30:43.080 --> 02:30:49.160
topic in these days in our schools. So I'll look for Board members who would like to make a comment

02:30:49.160 --> 02:30:56.280
on the distance learning proposal. Member McQuillan. Great job, David. Very good presentation.

02:30:56.920 --> 02:31:03.320
And following the theme of student input of all of our presentations have had that sort of theme

02:31:03.320 --> 02:31:09.560
to it. Very good suggestions. And I know our Superintendent Thurman has done a lot of work

02:31:09.560 --> 02:31:17.560
in this area in trying to bring services and meet the needs of all of California throughout

02:31:17.560 --> 02:31:23.560
California on distance learning. I think we've learned a lot over this past eight months, nine

02:31:23.560 --> 02:31:30.520
months. And I think it would be really important to bring that student voice in to have us

02:31:30.520 --> 02:31:38.520
validate what we've learned and add to what we are learning about distance learning and how it's

02:31:38.520 --> 02:31:43.720
working for students throughout the state of California. So some very good suggestions and

02:31:44.680 --> 02:31:50.360
I appreciate that. Thank you and good job. Thank you, Member McQuillan. Do we have any other

02:31:50.360 --> 02:31:56.200
Board members who would like to comment on the distance learning proposal? Member Navo.

02:31:58.440 --> 02:32:05.960
Yeah, I just wanted to thank you, David. And I believe our CDE and CCE are doing a tremendous

02:32:05.960 --> 02:32:10.840
amount of work in this area. It seems to me that that would be a place to get your group plugged

02:32:10.840 --> 02:32:16.040
into. Obviously the State Superintendent has done a lot of work on the digital divide conversation

02:32:16.040 --> 02:32:21.160
across the state. CCE is doing a lot of work with the distance learning. That being said,

02:32:21.160 --> 02:32:28.760
I agree with you. I think student voice needs to be present in those arenas, probably even more

02:32:28.760 --> 02:32:36.040
so than they already are. So I would encourage you to seek those two entities and to put your

02:32:36.040 --> 02:32:40.600
voice at those tables and conversations because that work is occurring across the state as well.

02:32:41.400 --> 02:32:45.480
But thank you for your presentation. It's very informative. Thank you, Member Navo.

02:32:45.480 --> 02:32:51.080
Just checking before we go to our final presentation. Anybody else want to make a

02:32:51.080 --> 02:32:59.320
comment on this one? So seeing no hands, I'll turn it over to Diego for our presentation on

02:32:59.320 --> 02:33:06.760
environmental sustainability. Right. So our last topic of environmental sustainability will be

02:33:06.760 --> 02:33:18.760
presented by Adalia Lu. Thank you, Diego. Good morning, the esteemed members of the

02:33:18.760 --> 02:33:23.240
California supportive education. My name is Adalia Lu and I'm a junior at Newbury Park High

02:33:23.240 --> 02:33:27.480
School in Newbury Park. I'm here on behalf of the California Association of Student Councils to

02:33:27.480 --> 02:33:31.000
discuss the development of environmental sustainability and consciousness in school

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:36.280
districts across California. Climate change is undeniably the most pressing issue facing

02:33:36.280 --> 02:33:40.680
our world today. Despite incessant attempts to politicize it, climate change remains

02:33:40.680 --> 02:33:46.280
the most destructive threat to our existence as a species, not as a political agenda. It's key

02:33:46.280 --> 02:33:51.080
that educational systems recognize, acknowledge, and take action to lead the way towards positive

02:33:51.080 --> 02:33:57.800
change. 2019 was the warmest year in history and global temperatures only continue to rise.

02:33:57.800 --> 02:34:02.520
California students continually fail to receive the same quality of education at the expense of

02:34:02.520 --> 02:34:07.560
these fires that burn up their fall semesters. In Northern California alone, classes were cancelled

02:34:07.560 --> 02:34:15.000
for more than 260,000 students due to wildfires and those numbers only rise. Kennedy Delaney,

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:19.000
one of our group members affected by the fires every year explained, I've been out of school due

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:23.960
to evacuations, power outages, and even unhealthy air quality. Students are missing out on their

02:34:23.960 --> 02:34:30.920
full opportunity to learn. We need action and we need it now. When education systems fail to

02:34:30.920 --> 02:34:35.240
prioritize climate change, citizens fail to as well desensitize to its effects. It's our

02:34:35.240 --> 02:34:39.720
responsibility to improve these conditions as much as we can for our students, to give voice to the

02:34:39.720 --> 02:34:44.280
thousands of California students who rallied for sustainability to the state capital, ensure their

02:34:44.280 --> 02:34:49.480
future, and enable their success. In the status quo, regulations for environmental sustainability

02:34:49.480 --> 02:34:53.720
are lacking. Policies that promote combating climate change in our local school boards either

02:34:53.720 --> 02:34:58.600
don't exist or fail to be equitably enforced. At Shasta High School in Reading, we can see that

02:34:58.600 --> 02:35:03.960
almost no discussion is dedicated to sustainable practices or policy, which if implemented would

02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:08.600
help mitigate the fires that Kennedy spoke about. However, in Oak Park Unified School District,

02:35:08.600 --> 02:35:14.280
the creation of a sustainability group composed of students and teachers has led to many improvements

02:35:14.280 --> 02:35:19.000
such as replacing toxic cleaning products and guaranteeing environmental literacy for every

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:24.440
student through science instruction. Thus, after thorough discussion this weekend at SAFE, we

02:35:24.440 --> 02:35:28.120
determined that the most effective course of action was for the State Board of Education to

02:35:28.120 --> 02:35:33.800
recommend all school districts to develop GDACs. Green District Advisory Councils focused on leading

02:35:33.800 --> 02:35:39.160
and implementing a variety of sustainable initiatives at that local nonpartisan level,

02:35:39.160 --> 02:35:43.720
allowing for district-specific environmental concerns like implementing hand dryers,

02:35:43.720 --> 02:35:49.880
renewable energy, tribe and systems, and more to be addressed at their own timelines. Staffed with

02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:55.000
qualified adult volunteers and passionate students, these GDACs would legitimize the urgency of climate

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:59.400
change as members would pragmatically and systematically combat it through the education

02:35:59.400 --> 02:36:03.880
system. Locals with a passion for climate justice will be empowered and uplifted,

02:36:03.880 --> 02:36:07.560
given the opportunity to hold their school districts accountable and make this tangible

02:36:07.560 --> 02:36:12.200
change. This measure creates unification across the state and initiative, whilst maintaining

02:36:12.200 --> 02:36:17.560
autonomy within each area, allowing them to take transparent action in what equitable,

02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:23.080
effective and efficient manner is possible for each, all at their own pace. Our plan is not

02:36:23.080 --> 02:36:27.480
solely concerned with the immediate. Legislative fluidity, consistency and continuity designed

02:36:27.480 --> 02:36:31.400
for the long term are inherent in the creation of these GDACs, which we hope become a staple in

02:36:31.400 --> 02:36:35.400
California school boards. The battle against climate change is lengthy, it's uphill and it's

02:36:35.400 --> 02:36:39.240
definitely difficult, but with the establishment of these advisory councils, we take a step in the

02:36:39.240 --> 02:36:44.520
right direction. Each district will be poised in a position to cause change. Environmentally

02:36:44.520 --> 02:36:49.800
conscious legislation will receive the dedicated, continued focus from a number of committed

02:36:49.800 --> 02:36:54.440
individuals without the loss of valuable time and energy of local school boards. Ultimately,

02:36:54.440 --> 02:36:58.680
we'll be able to see a dramatic improvement, not just for those involved in the education system,

02:36:58.680 --> 02:37:04.120
but for our society as a whole. The example that this prioritization would set is irreplaceable,

02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:08.920
and it gives way to a significant improvement in student health, success, representation and more,

02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:14.840
all at no risk. Thank you for your time. Thank you, Adalia, so much for you and your committee.

02:37:15.560 --> 02:37:21.400
So we want some board member comments on environmental stability and the proposal of

02:37:21.400 --> 02:37:28.760
GDACs, Green District Advisory Councils. So let's see, Member, President Darling-Hammond,

02:37:28.760 --> 02:37:34.680
I'll call on you first. All right, first of all, thank you, and I want to thank the preceding

02:37:34.680 --> 02:37:41.640
speakers that I was able to hear, all really amazing, wonderful and well spoken and well

02:37:41.640 --> 02:37:48.200
thought out. This is really important, and I appreciate you developing a way to think about

02:37:48.200 --> 02:37:56.280
what districts could be doing. I gave my remarks this morning in part on the same issue of climate

02:37:56.280 --> 02:38:02.440
change, and what goes with the GDACs, I love the fact that you already have an acronym.

02:38:03.880 --> 02:38:09.880
Once you have an acronym, you have a real thing in education, that these GDACs actually might

02:38:09.880 --> 02:38:16.440
relate in some way to some kind of advisory council, like a state level, because we really

02:38:16.440 --> 02:38:21.640
need to get the places that are doing good work. I flagged some districts this morning that are

02:38:21.640 --> 02:38:30.440
really leading in some areas of climate conservation. We need a way that we can get those

02:38:30.440 --> 02:38:38.680
ideas out to other districts as well, so I really appreciate this. I like your idea. It might,

02:38:39.560 --> 02:38:46.520
we might think about whether there's an easier acronym, but the content is excellent, and I

02:38:46.520 --> 02:38:53.000
appreciate you putting it out so thoughtfully. So I'll look for other board members, and while

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:57.480
I'm looking for any other hands, I'll just make a comment. As liaison to the next generation

02:38:57.480 --> 02:39:02.600
science standards implementation, we've been talking about environmental practices and

02:39:03.160 --> 02:39:07.800
through the implementation of science and helping students be more aware, and I do think

02:39:07.800 --> 02:39:12.760
the suggestions and the examples that you gave Adalia with you and your team really highlight

02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:18.680
the challenges, particularly in California, when we saw our entire state full of smoke a few in

02:39:18.680 --> 02:39:25.480
September, and realizing how it impacts our student education. I think you bring up some very important

02:39:25.480 --> 02:39:29.720
examples of what students are learning and experiencing during their learning process,

02:39:29.720 --> 02:39:34.280
and what we really need to think about. So I just want to thank your committee and see if there's

02:39:34.280 --> 02:39:42.440
any other hands raised. Member Song, I see your hand waving. Go ahead. Thank you. I wasn't sure

02:39:42.440 --> 02:39:49.880
how to raise my hand in there, but just I had not commented yet on any of the specific proposals,

02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:55.240
but I just I want to make kind of a summary comment that, you know, we know our schools

02:39:55.240 --> 02:40:03.240
are microcosms of our society and often reflect the social and political issues that are happening,

02:40:03.240 --> 02:40:09.560
and I just really want to thank the students who put so much thought, all the topics that you raised,

02:40:09.560 --> 02:40:17.960
the environmental concerns, distance learning, safety, dealing with racial inequities, bullying,

02:40:17.960 --> 02:40:25.720
civics, education, and valuing voice. All of these are issues that we are facing now in kind of our

02:40:25.720 --> 02:40:31.960
larger society, which you are raising, and more than that, you have also come up with very solid

02:40:31.960 --> 02:40:38.840
solutions to these issues and problems, and I completely agree that the value of the student

02:40:38.840 --> 02:40:47.400
voice, because you're shaping our future, it's it best impacts you so that you really need to have a

02:40:47.400 --> 02:40:53.640
seat at the tables when we adults have these conversations. So I just want to thank all of

02:40:53.640 --> 02:41:01.640
you for your work and your time and for presenting to us today. So I'll look and see if in summarizing

02:41:01.720 --> 02:41:06.920
any comments. I just want to miss any board members who would like to make a comment. This was a

02:41:06.920 --> 02:41:12.840
really impactful presentation, gives us a lot to think about and a lot of ways to look at what we

02:41:12.840 --> 02:41:19.080
can do to integrate our work and also to take a look at how we can help support counties and districts.

02:41:19.080 --> 02:41:24.440
Member McQuillen. I want to thank all the students for their great presentations.

02:41:25.400 --> 02:41:31.240
You did a great job with the research and working with your teams and taking the feedback in the

02:41:31.240 --> 02:41:39.000
early planning and taking that feedback and integrating it. You all did great in bringing

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:47.480
important topics to this board. So thank you all. Any other board member comments? I just would say

02:41:48.200 --> 02:41:52.840
so articulate, well written, and so well researched. Member Rodriguez.

02:41:53.560 --> 02:42:00.440
Thank you, yes, and to echo all of that and thank you students for stepping up and

02:42:01.960 --> 02:42:06.760
sharing your concerns with us. It makes me sad that you're the ones that are

02:42:08.040 --> 02:42:14.600
looking at solutions for the environment in your high school years. However,

02:42:15.080 --> 02:42:22.840
however, I'm glad that you are speaking up about this and we have to listen because

02:42:23.720 --> 02:42:29.720
we are at a breaking point with a lot of the things as we've seen in California with the fire.

02:42:29.720 --> 02:42:37.560
So the issues of justice and of race that you brought up, I read this report and I was just

02:42:37.560 --> 02:42:46.600
so excited turning the pages. I printed it out because my lives have been changed by

02:42:47.320 --> 02:42:52.680
the students that I've worked with and today is no different. You're not my students,

02:42:52.680 --> 02:42:58.920
but I'm hearing your voices and I hear the voices of every child that's been in front of me. So

02:42:59.960 --> 02:43:07.400
thank you and we will do our part to ensure that our schools fit the needs of the students that

02:43:07.480 --> 02:43:16.360
are in there. Thank you, member Rodriguez. So do we have any other board member comments on this

02:43:16.360 --> 02:43:23.480
item to close it? Let me just, I'm just checking the participant list or look at your picture and

02:43:23.480 --> 02:43:30.120
put your hand up in the, if you want to make a comment. Okay, I'm going to turn the board

02:43:30.120 --> 02:43:35.080
meeting back to President Darling-Hammond and we're going to move on to item four. Thank you.

02:43:35.080 --> 02:43:40.360
Terrific. Thank you and thanks again to all the students. Awesome presentations.

02:43:42.200 --> 02:43:46.040
Now we're going to move to item four, which is the mega assessment item.

02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:50.200
This is the last item before lunch. If you're wondering when you'll get a chance to eat,

02:43:50.200 --> 02:43:58.040
it will be right after this. We will make it expeditious so everyone can eat soon.

02:43:58.920 --> 02:44:01.960
The California assessment of student performance and progress system,

02:44:02.920 --> 02:44:09.640
the English language proficiency assessments for California, the California high school

02:44:09.640 --> 02:44:15.400
proficiency examination and physical fitness test. This is approvable proposed revisions

02:44:16.040 --> 02:44:20.600
to the Smarter Bell summative assessments for English language arts, literacy and mathematics

02:44:20.600 --> 02:44:26.520
blueprints, approval of the proposed initial and summative alternative English language proficiency

02:44:26.600 --> 02:44:34.360
assessments, students school reports and update on program activities. And this item will be

02:44:34.360 --> 02:44:41.000
presented by Mel Vang of the CVE. I see that the PowerPoint is ready to go. Mal, please begin.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.080
We're not hearing you. I don't know if you're on mute.

02:44:56.840 --> 02:45:05.160
Okay. How about that? Better. All right. I apologize. Okay. So good morning,

02:45:05.160 --> 02:45:10.360
Superintendent Thurman, President Darlin-Hammond and board members. I'm Mal Vang, the director

02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:14.840
for the assessment development and administration division at the California Department of Education.

02:45:15.400 --> 02:45:22.520
The item before you today is an action item. So for this presentation,

02:45:22.760 --> 02:45:28.600
the California Department of Education has two recommendations for approval and we will finish

02:45:28.600 --> 02:45:36.200
with time for questions for both recommendations. Rachel Maves, our deputy superintendent of the

02:45:36.200 --> 02:45:42.360
Instruction and Measurement branch, will join me to share some opening remarks after I cover the

02:45:42.600 --> 02:45:48.280
recommendations. So the California Department of Education is seeking approval on the proposed

02:45:48.280 --> 02:45:55.080
revisions to the Spring 2021 Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for English Language Arts,

02:45:55.880 --> 02:46:03.320
Literacy or ELA, and Mathematics Blueprints as described in Tables 2 and 4 in order to allow for

02:46:03.320 --> 02:46:10.520
ELA and Mathematics Blueprints as described in Tables 2 and 4 in order to allow for a short

02:46:10.520 --> 02:46:19.160
test form and the proposed student score reports for the initial and summative alternate English

02:46:19.160 --> 02:46:27.000
Language Proficiency Assessments for California or ALPAC as described in Attachment 2. So now

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:33.240
I'd like Rachel to come and make some opening remarks before I continue on.

02:46:38.360 --> 02:46:44.600
Thank you, Dr. Bang. As we ask you to consider approving the adjusted blueprints or shortened

02:46:44.600 --> 02:46:50.440
forms for ELA and math assessments, I would like to situate our discussion in the current context.

02:46:51.400 --> 02:46:58.840
First, there are still many unknowns. I suppose we should not expect anything less from a year

02:46:58.840 --> 02:47:05.320
that has brought a global pandemic, historic fires, rolling power outages, and I think the

02:47:05.320 --> 02:47:11.480
only one that Madam President Darling-Hammond forgot was murder hornets. We do not know what

02:47:11.480 --> 02:47:16.920
COVID cases will look like two months from now when the assessment window opens. We do not know

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:22.200
how many LEAs will move forward with their plans to bring students back for in-person instruction

02:47:22.200 --> 02:47:28.360
in January or how many will be fully engaged in distance learning. We are bringing to you

02:47:28.360 --> 02:47:34.200
our recommendation to approve an adjusted blueprint based on what we do know right now.

02:47:35.400 --> 02:47:41.320
We know that the ED has indicated in a letter to chief state school officers on September 3rd

02:47:41.800 --> 02:47:46.360
that they will not consider a waiver and that states should prepare to administer tests

02:47:46.360 --> 02:47:53.000
as required under ESSA. We also know that we have LEAs in varying degrees of reopening across the

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:59.400
state. We know that we have students with varying degrees of bandwidth and we know that we must

02:47:59.400 --> 02:48:06.920
continue to provide flexibility and innovative options to support students, teachers, and families

02:48:06.920 --> 02:48:15.400
in an ever-shifting landscape. Second, timing is imperative. Consideration of an adjusted

02:48:15.400 --> 02:48:21.400
blueprint is not a decision we can delay until the next board meeting. As you all know, California

02:48:21.400 --> 02:48:31.080
serves 6.2 million students. Of the 6.2 million, 4.5 million test each year. Year over year,

02:48:31.080 --> 02:48:37.080
California's participation rate in testing is upwards of 95%, indicating a high value in

02:48:37.080 --> 02:48:43.160
our ability to understand how we collectively as a state are serving our 6.2 million students.

02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:50.040
If we wait to discuss testing until some of our unknowns are settled, we potentially place

02:48:50.040 --> 02:48:56.280
ourselves in a position without options. For California to administer a reduced blueprint,

02:48:56.280 --> 02:49:03.160
it requires time for our contractors to revise the test itself. It requires time to support

02:49:03.160 --> 02:49:08.840
the thousands of test administrators and examiners that work diligently to ensure testing is

02:49:08.840 --> 02:49:15.960
seamlessly executed each year. And this year, it will require additional time to support and educate

02:49:15.960 --> 02:49:21.080
parents as they have been and continue to be partners in their children's education.

02:49:21.880 --> 02:49:27.560
If we wait until January to make this decision, a reduced blueprint will no longer be an option

02:49:27.560 --> 02:49:36.520
for LEAs. During this time, LEAs need flexibility, options, and ongoing support as they collect data

02:49:36.520 --> 02:49:43.400
across multiple measures to fully understand the impact of the last several months. Today's

02:49:43.400 --> 02:49:49.640
recommendation to adopt the adjusted blueprints is one of many steps as we commit to working

02:49:50.040 --> 02:49:56.680
alongside educational stakeholders to design a long-term plan to support learning recovery.

02:49:57.960 --> 02:50:03.240
With that, I'd like to invite Dr. Vang back to the podium and she'll continue with this item. Thank you.

02:50:10.120 --> 02:50:11.000
Thank you, Rachel.

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:24.280
So, before I go on, I want to provide an overview of our California assessment system to bring focus

02:50:24.280 --> 02:50:31.640
into what our recommendations are about today. So, on one side of our system, we have our suite

02:50:31.640 --> 02:50:37.960
of California assessment of student performance and progress. And under that, it includes the

02:50:37.960 --> 02:50:42.760
Smarter Balanced Assessments for English Language Arts, Literacy, or ELA in Mathematics,

02:50:43.400 --> 02:50:48.360
which consists of the summative assessments, interim assessments, and the formative assessments

02:50:49.080 --> 02:50:55.560
through the Tools for Teachers system. We also have the California Science Test or CAST,

02:50:55.560 --> 02:51:01.320
the California Alternate Assessments or CAAs for English Language Arts, Mathematics, and Science,

02:51:02.040 --> 02:51:07.320
the California Spanish Assessment or CSA, and our Grade II Diagnostic Assessments.

02:51:08.920 --> 02:51:16.520
And then on the LPAC side of our assessment system are the initial LPAC, the summative LPAC,

02:51:17.080 --> 02:51:24.040
the initial and summative alternate LPAC, which is in development. And I wanted to remind us that in

02:51:24.040 --> 02:51:31.800
2018, when the LPAC was integrated into the CASP system, with both programs, it became,

02:51:33.160 --> 02:51:37.000
both programs went under the umbrella of the California assessment system.

02:51:37.960 --> 02:51:43.800
So today's recommendations focus only on the summative assessments. Let me see if I can,

02:51:44.600 --> 02:51:51.000
right here. Blueprint, summative assessments blueprint, and the initial and summative LPAC

02:51:51.560 --> 02:52:02.360
student score reports of this big assessment system. So our division also

02:52:03.320 --> 02:52:08.680
oversees and supports the work for several other assessments, including the physical fitness test,

02:52:09.240 --> 02:52:14.360
the California High School Proficiency Examination, and high school equivalency

02:52:14.360 --> 02:52:20.520
tests such as the GED and HICET, and the National Assessment of Educational Progress.

02:52:22.360 --> 02:52:24.040
Just to give you a little overview.

02:52:32.520 --> 02:52:38.440
As we go into the first recommendation, I want to cover some or highlight the key events

02:52:38.440 --> 02:52:45.160
that brought us to where we are today. Remember that in March 2020, California requested and

02:52:45.160 --> 02:52:50.120
received approval from the U.S. Department of Education to waive the testing requirement

02:52:51.400 --> 02:52:57.240
given the pandemic. Well, in June 2020, the CDE issued our Stronger Together,

02:52:57.240 --> 02:53:03.480
a guidebook for the safe reopening of California's public schools. Then through all summer 2020,

02:53:03.480 --> 02:53:09.880
the CDE learned that an overwhelming number of local educational agencies or LEAs will return

02:53:09.880 --> 02:53:15.960
to school using distance learning formats. So to meet the demands of distance learning, CDE did

02:53:15.960 --> 02:53:22.280
explore and transition to offering multiple test administration options for the initial LPAC

02:53:22.920 --> 02:53:29.240
and the optional summative LPAC during July and August, and these options went live on September

02:53:29.240 --> 02:53:36.760
3rd. And another key event, as Rachel mentioned, was that the U.S. Department of Education

02:53:37.480 --> 02:53:44.040
sent us a letter advising states that assessment waivers would not be considered for spring 2021

02:53:44.040 --> 02:53:45.880
test administrations at this time.

02:53:50.360 --> 02:53:55.960
So knowing that summative testing will not be waived again this year, the CDE understands

02:53:55.960 --> 02:54:03.160
the following background points. So regardless of the mode of instruction in spring, there will be

02:54:03.160 --> 02:54:09.800
more competing demands on our students' time than ever before, and the CDE is seeking opportunities

02:54:09.800 --> 02:54:16.920
to really maximize flexibility for LEAs while keeping the critical elements of our instructor

02:54:16.920 --> 02:54:23.560
intact. So the use of the adjusted short test forms for the Smarter Balanced summative assessments

02:54:23.560 --> 02:54:29.000
for English language arts and math could provide gathering essential data with less bandwidth and

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:37.800
student testing time. So in order to use the test forms, the short test forms, and preserve the

02:54:37.800 --> 02:54:45.160
maximum flexibility for our LEAs in spring 2021, the State Board of Education, or the California

02:54:45.160 --> 02:54:51.080
State Board of Education, would need to approve revised shorter blueprints for both English

02:54:51.080 --> 02:54:59.960
language arts and mathematics per California Education Code Section 60640C5. So the CDE does

02:54:59.960 --> 02:55:04.600
not recommend changes to the other non-Smarter Balanced blueprints at this time.

02:55:08.440 --> 02:55:17.160
So the following rationale were made for the revised blueprints, which are referred to really

02:55:17.160 --> 02:55:23.240
the short test form in the item. So the revised blueprints are derived from our adopted Smarter

02:55:23.240 --> 02:55:29.080
Balanced summative assessments for English language arts and mathematics. We are proposing

02:55:29.080 --> 02:55:37.320
that the computer adapted portion be adjusted to about 50% for each claim, and the revised

02:55:37.480 --> 02:55:48.760
blueprints will keep a comparable proportion of the content across the claims, which I will

02:55:48.760 --> 02:55:55.800
cover more about claims in the upcoming slides. So given that the performance tasks are designed

02:55:55.800 --> 02:56:03.240
to be integrated tasks, the blueprints associated with them have not been adjusted. We propose to

02:56:03.240 --> 02:56:12.040
keep the performance tasks intact. So continuing on with further rationale,

02:56:12.040 --> 02:56:16.600
the revised blueprints maintain the same proportion of depth of knowledge assessed.

02:56:17.640 --> 02:56:24.520
So in this option, this does not require additional cost to California.

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:33.800
And finally, these revised blueprints are considered temporary for the 2021 spring administration.

02:56:36.520 --> 02:56:41.000
So some pros or benefits with the adoption of the proposed adjusted blueprints

02:56:42.440 --> 02:56:50.360
is that it reduces the amount of time students spend on the test. It provides more flexibility

02:56:51.160 --> 02:56:58.600
in scheduling for the adequate monitoring of our administrations. It reduces the exposure,

02:56:58.600 --> 02:57:05.560
potential exposure of the items from the item bank, and minimizes the risk of connectivity

02:57:05.560 --> 02:57:12.680
or network issues that may arise. It allows LEAs to continue to meet federal testing requirements.

02:57:13.960 --> 02:57:19.000
The individual student overall scores can be reported as I will explain further later.

02:57:19.640 --> 02:57:23.560
And these are the measures that can also be used for federal reporting.

02:57:24.520 --> 02:57:28.920
However, there are some cons and drawbacks that I will share on the next slide.

02:57:30.600 --> 02:57:37.640
So in adopting the proposed revised blueprints, there is still potential risks of exposure of

02:57:37.640 --> 02:57:45.400
the items as in any given year. And there are scheduling and time impacts on LEAs for completing

02:57:45.400 --> 02:57:51.800
the testing. And there are less, again, there are less details that will be reported at the student

02:57:51.800 --> 02:57:58.360
level. Again, those claim scores will not be reported. And at this time, as Rachel mentioned,

02:57:58.360 --> 02:58:05.400
it is unclear what student data results will be available until all the analysis and test

02:58:05.400 --> 02:58:13.000
administrations have occurred or has been completed. So I would like to

02:58:14.920 --> 02:58:18.040
go on to share the proposed revised blueprints with you.

02:58:20.040 --> 02:58:27.160
So this table displays the recommended revised ELA blueprint. The total items by grade for the full

02:58:27.160 --> 02:58:39.160
form in italics are provided for reference. The row, this row here, let me see if I can get my little

02:58:42.440 --> 02:58:52.360
pointer again. So this row here, oh, sorry, maybe I won't tinker with that.

02:58:53.160 --> 02:59:04.840
So after the italics full form items, you'll see the row that indicates the proposed revised

02:59:04.840 --> 02:59:11.720
blueprint. And it has the claims under that. Claim one is reading, claim two is writing,

02:59:11.720 --> 02:59:17.880
claim three is listening, claim four is research inquiry. There are other words used for these

02:59:17.880 --> 02:59:24.280
claims, like areas or domains, depending on the assessment. But for the Smarter Balanced,

02:59:24.280 --> 02:59:31.160
we call them claims for this purpose. And the proposed items per claim by grade underneath.

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:37.240
So the difference is that the computer adapted test items, right here,

02:59:37.720 --> 02:59:47.800
goes from, in grades three through five, goes from 36 to 39 items to 20. And then six to eight,

02:59:47.800 --> 02:59:55.560
and then we're maintaining the performance task in grades six through eight. It goes from 36 to

02:59:55.960 --> 03:00:07.240
from 36 to 40 items to down to 22. And then in grade 11, it goes from 37 to 39 items to 22.

03:00:11.080 --> 03:00:16.920
And then here is the recommended revised mathematics blueprint. Again, the full

03:00:16.920 --> 03:00:23.640
form here is provided for reference. And then for the short form in grades three through five,

03:00:23.640 --> 03:00:34.120
it goes from 31 to 34 items to 17. Maintaining the PT or performance task, grade six goes from

03:00:34.120 --> 03:00:44.760
30 to 34 items down to 16 to 17. And then grade six, we have only grade 11, maintain the PT.

03:00:44.760 --> 03:00:49.560
And then in grade 11, we have 33 to 36 items down to 18.

03:00:54.040 --> 03:00:59.960
So that, having said that, I want to give you a little bit more context and information about

03:00:59.960 --> 03:01:05.000
estimated testing times for Smarter Balanced summative assessments, because that is what we

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:12.600
use for our English language arts and mathematics summative assessments. And here I've provided the

03:01:12.600 --> 03:01:21.800
estimated test times for the computer adapted tests, here for the full form, and what it would

03:01:21.800 --> 03:01:29.560
be reduced to for the short form. Now we're keeping the performance task intact by grade,

03:01:29.560 --> 03:01:36.840
and then by yellowing math, and then by both. And then what the full form total hours and minutes are

03:01:36.840 --> 03:01:46.600
by grade or grade span, and then what the totals would be for the short form. So the last two

03:01:46.600 --> 03:01:51.960
columns really show that comparison of estimated testing times for the full form and the short form.

03:01:52.600 --> 03:01:59.480
And as you can see, there is significant time savings, especially at the upper grades,

03:01:59.480 --> 03:02:04.280
because you're really saving like two hours of testing time there, an hour and 45 minutes there

03:02:05.400 --> 03:02:09.800
in grades six through eight, and an hour and a half in the lower grades.

03:02:10.280 --> 03:02:16.200
Okay, and then I want to share some background information about our other non-Smarter

03:02:16.200 --> 03:02:24.200
Balanced CASP assessments and the estimated testing time. So with those, as I mentioned earlier,

03:02:24.200 --> 03:02:30.440
we are not recommending changes to these non-Smarter Balanced CASP summative assessments,

03:02:31.160 --> 03:02:37.160
as they really are already shorter, much shorter, as indicated in this table.

03:02:37.160 --> 03:02:53.400
Okay, and then for the ALPAC, again, they're much shorter, like an hour. Of course, the upper grades

03:02:54.280 --> 03:03:01.080
do have more, because there's more writing and reading assessments. But again, it's much

03:03:01.480 --> 03:03:10.440
shorter than even the Smarter Balanced assessment. So the question is, so I wanted to bring some

03:03:10.440 --> 03:03:18.040
context to the types of reporting that are on a student score report. Here I have an image of an

03:03:18.040 --> 03:03:24.360
English language arts assessment for a student, and at the top of the student score report is where

03:03:24.360 --> 03:03:33.800
the student's overall scale score and achievement level, right here, are reported along with the

03:03:33.800 --> 03:03:42.200
school and the state average scale scores and achievement levels. So the bottom part here

03:03:42.920 --> 03:03:49.160
are the claims, and the claims are the more granular reporting areas that are available on

03:03:49.160 --> 03:03:56.840
the full form. But with the revised blueprint, the claims scores are not going to be reported

03:03:56.840 --> 03:04:04.040
at the student level. So I just want to remind us that while summative assessments are useful

03:04:04.040 --> 03:04:11.160
for districts and schools to identify general areas of improvement, they're really not meant

03:04:11.160 --> 03:04:18.200
to be diagnostic. So as Rachel mentioned earlier, using multiple measures that include diagnostic,

03:04:18.200 --> 03:04:24.520
formative, and interim assessments or benchmarks can provide a more holistic picture of the

03:04:24.520 --> 03:04:31.560
individual student's academic progress. So the removal of the claims scores from the student

03:04:31.560 --> 03:04:37.000
score report could be considered a reasonable trade-off, given the multiple opportunities to

03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:47.160
collect other rich student level data throughout the year. And with the performance tasks intact,

03:04:47.160 --> 03:04:54.680
we will be able to provide writing trait scores at the individual and group level. So this image

03:04:54.680 --> 03:05:00.120
provides a summary of writing trait scores by the categories of evidence or elaboration,

03:05:01.720 --> 03:05:07.800
organization and purpose, and conventions through the California educator reporting system.

03:05:07.800 --> 03:05:18.520
At the group level, in terms of scores at the group level, they can still be reported by mean

03:05:18.520 --> 03:05:26.840
scale scores and achievement levels, such as this sample English language arts summary public report,

03:05:26.840 --> 03:05:33.720
right? We can still do the scale scores here, sorry, a little too fast. The mean scale scores

03:05:33.720 --> 03:05:42.360
here, and then the performance, the achievement levels by each level here as an example.

03:05:43.720 --> 03:05:50.600
And although the claims or the areas cannot be reported at the student level, at the group level,

03:05:50.600 --> 03:05:56.920
we can still provide that. So furthermore, these scores at the group level can be reported by

03:05:57.000 --> 03:06:05.080
claim, such as our reading, writing, listening, research or inquiry. Again, this is from our

03:06:06.040 --> 03:06:08.200
ELA summary public report by grade.

03:06:11.320 --> 03:06:18.600
So the proposed, our proposed timeline for implementation is as follows. Currently,

03:06:18.600 --> 03:06:26.120
the CDE has available under the CASP program, the California Alternate Assessment for Science

03:06:26.120 --> 03:06:35.640
is already available since September 8th. And this is really the four performance tasks that

03:06:35.640 --> 03:06:40.600
are administered close to instruction, they really have the entire school year to work on that.

03:06:41.400 --> 03:06:49.960
So the regular, on January 12th, 2021 is when our other CASP assessments will be available.

03:06:50.520 --> 03:06:56.920
This includes the California Science Tests or CASP, the California Alternates for English

03:06:56.920 --> 03:07:02.760
Language Arts Mathematics, and the California Spanish Assessment. And then the summative

03:07:02.760 --> 03:07:11.800
LPAC will open or launch on February 1st, 2021. And the revised blueprints are, if they should be

03:07:12.360 --> 03:07:18.040
approved today, we anticipate that the CASP launch for the Smarter Balanced ELA Mathematics

03:07:18.040 --> 03:07:25.400
tests will be available sometime in January, but we are being conservative with late February

03:07:25.400 --> 03:07:34.840
as the latest they will be available. Right now, we, as Rachel mentioned earlier, we do have a lot

03:07:34.840 --> 03:07:43.240
of unknowns. And what we do know is that we had a year without data in spring 2020. And this

03:07:43.800 --> 03:07:50.440
really puts us on a path to the possibility of getting more information as a way to check on

03:07:50.440 --> 03:07:57.800
the system. And once the summative testing window opens, the CDE will monitor the data along with

03:07:57.800 --> 03:08:05.080
our contractor from the summative assessment throughout the whole entire window. And we will

03:08:05.080 --> 03:08:12.360
provide updates on the availability and potential uses of the data as appropriate. So we are working

03:08:12.360 --> 03:08:19.240
on guidance that will allow LEAs options and flexibility to meet the needs of their unique

03:08:19.240 --> 03:08:27.640
contacts. So at this time, before I go to the second recommendation, I'd like to stop and see

03:08:27.640 --> 03:08:30.600
if there are any questions about this first recommendation.

03:08:31.240 --> 03:08:42.840
A member of Patel-Brownson has a question.

03:08:42.840 --> 03:08:52.840
Talking to myself, I'm mute. Any clarification questions?

03:08:54.840 --> 03:09:00.280
Yes. Please, Kim. Thank you. I just wanted to confirm

03:09:00.760 --> 03:09:07.400
as to whether parents will be receiving these scores. Certainly in the context of my own

03:09:07.400 --> 03:09:12.360
local district, I know parents watch these. And although they're not necessarily

03:09:14.440 --> 03:09:21.160
used as a sole source diagnostic, I don't think anyone would propose that. It is oftentimes,

03:09:22.200 --> 03:09:29.240
it's a feedback mechanism. And particularly in the context of COVID, and especially in the context

03:09:29.240 --> 03:09:35.960
of the early years where parents are playing such an important supplemental role, especially

03:09:35.960 --> 03:09:47.160
for early literacy and reading acquisition, it is a very helpful guide. So one, will parents receive

03:09:47.160 --> 03:09:54.360
it? And then two, I pulled out my own kid's little scores that you can't see it here with the blue

03:09:54.360 --> 03:10:04.360
screen. But will the scaled scores still be a part of the short order form that is provided so

03:10:04.360 --> 03:10:12.360
you get, you know, the 2000 to 3000 range number that's there at the top of the screen that you

03:10:12.360 --> 03:10:18.680
just had up and still have the child score, the school average, and the state average?

03:10:19.320 --> 03:10:25.960
Yes, if everything goes according to plan and there are no

03:10:28.120 --> 03:10:35.400
other natural disasters or emergencies of sorts, and we could fully implement this this spring,

03:10:35.400 --> 03:10:41.800
you will still receive all the results at the very top. Your child score, the scale score,

03:10:42.760 --> 03:10:49.800
and the school averages and the state averages. And also it'll tell you that the child's achievement

03:10:49.800 --> 03:10:57.960
level as well. The only thing you're missing out is the domains here that roll up to be the total

03:10:57.960 --> 03:11:06.360
score. Sorry, and I have one follow-up question. Because the domains or the claims are also very

03:11:06.440 --> 03:11:10.440
helpful, I think, for parents who are trying to supplement and especially

03:11:11.480 --> 03:11:18.040
catch up kids oftentimes over the summer when there's challenges. Has there been any conversation

03:11:18.040 --> 03:11:25.720
about whether, for example, if the reliability of the data degrades because of the smaller

03:11:26.840 --> 03:11:34.360
sample size of questions going to 50 percent? What I noticed, again, just looking at my own

03:11:34.360 --> 03:11:41.720
kids scores, is that in the elementary school years, some of these claims are already collapsed.

03:11:41.720 --> 03:11:48.920
So, for example, for my third and fifth grader, problem solving and modeling and data analysis

03:11:48.920 --> 03:11:55.160
on the math are already combined. And does that potentially give us a mechanism by which to provide

03:11:55.960 --> 03:12:03.480
more information to parents who want to actually do the supplemental work that's particularly needed

03:12:03.480 --> 03:12:14.200
in the context of COVID? As you mentioned, this is really one source of data. So hopefully you have,

03:12:15.480 --> 03:12:20.680
in terms of the reporting, if we go to the short form, we won't have those at the individual level.

03:12:21.400 --> 03:12:27.320
But you could have your child's scale scores and achievement level to compare to how your school

03:12:27.320 --> 03:12:34.840
did and how the state did overall. However, the reliability of the tests, Eric, are you here?

03:12:36.280 --> 03:12:42.920
Okay, I will have Dr. Eric Zilbert come and share a little bit about the

03:12:43.720 --> 03:12:48.600
reliability of the assessment going from a full form to a short form.

03:12:50.440 --> 03:12:55.560
Let me just note that we have asked all districts in California to be using formative

03:12:55.560 --> 03:13:02.280
assessment tools, diagnostic assessment tools, this fall. And that's actually been part of

03:13:02.280 --> 03:13:09.240
their continuity planning, et cetera. So everyone should have more data about their child available

03:13:10.120 --> 03:13:17.000
from other assessments the district is using. And we'll go to this discussion. I do want to

03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:21.080
remind people that we're talking only about clarification questions right now. We still have

03:13:21.080 --> 03:13:26.360
the rest of the item in public comment to go. So we'll take a brief discussion of reliability.

03:13:27.080 --> 03:13:31.160
A couple other folks have clarifying questions and then we'll, I see you.

03:13:32.440 --> 03:13:36.920
And we'll, but we will come back for full discussion. So go ahead.

03:13:38.040 --> 03:13:42.280
Yeah, I was just going to say that the Smarter Balanced full forms have

03:13:43.240 --> 03:13:50.120
all around .92. So that basically means that if you gave the test twice,

03:13:50.120 --> 03:13:57.880
you'd have 92% agreement between the two tests. For the shorter form, those go down to about .88

03:13:57.880 --> 03:14:04.360
or .87, depending on the grade and subject. So you can see you're getting a little bit more error,

03:14:04.360 --> 03:14:10.200
a little bit less precision with the shorter form, but it should be adequate for reporting

03:14:10.200 --> 03:14:18.040
scale scores and performance levels. Thank you very much. In the queue, I have

03:14:19.320 --> 03:14:23.960
Ting, Patricia, and Matt. I think Matt was actually first on those list. And again,

03:14:23.960 --> 03:14:29.480
let's keep it to clarifying questions, brief ones so that we can get through the rest of the item

03:14:29.480 --> 03:14:33.080
and then we'll come back and have a full discussion. Matt? I'm good. I had a question

03:14:33.080 --> 03:14:39.320
about parent communication. Kim covered it. Okay. And then we have Ting and then Patricia.

03:14:40.680 --> 03:14:47.000
Mal, can you just clarify, you had mentioned that ED will not be entertaining any waivers

03:14:47.000 --> 03:14:54.120
of assessments. Can you just clarify that means all the CASP, the entire CASP or just the Smarter

03:14:54.120 --> 03:15:02.440
Balanced portions? No. So all the assessments that are required under ESSA, as I mentioned,

03:15:02.520 --> 03:15:12.600
all those under CASP and LPAC are all required assessments under ESSA. Okay.

03:15:15.640 --> 03:15:22.840
Let me just say, because we're getting a little into the other questions, that

03:15:25.640 --> 03:15:30.920
this decision does not have to do with, is a separate decision from whether under a new

03:15:30.920 --> 03:15:36.360
administration or under different pandemic conditions, we might ask for a waiver of

03:15:36.360 --> 03:15:41.000
something having to do with assessment or accountability. This is a separate decision

03:15:41.000 --> 03:15:46.840
about just the short form because we can cross that bridge if and when we get to it. Yeah,

03:15:47.400 --> 03:15:52.440
that's fine. I just wanted to clarify so that we understand that we're talking about the

03:15:52.440 --> 03:15:59.000
all of CASP and we talk about the federal requirements. And then my other question is,

03:15:59.320 --> 03:16:07.160
for these two particular blueprints, they're part of Smarter Balanced. So does this or other

03:16:07.160 --> 03:16:16.600
Smarter Balanced states also doing something similar to this? Well, they are exploring the

03:16:16.600 --> 03:16:23.160
same options as we are. I believe that Hawaii already have approval on one of their short forms.

03:16:24.120 --> 03:16:29.080
I just learned that they haven't implemented it, but they have approval on one of them.

03:16:30.440 --> 03:16:35.640
So they're all in the same boat as we are. And a lot of times because we are so big,

03:16:35.640 --> 03:16:42.360
many are kind of waiting to see what we do. I don't like to be first, but you know, sometimes

03:16:42.360 --> 03:16:49.320
we just have to make the hard decisions. Right. Yeah. And I know that we share data and there's

03:16:49.320 --> 03:16:55.320
some kind of data analysis within the consortium. So I was kind of curious if there's kind of some

03:16:55.320 --> 03:17:05.320
consistency across the consortium on how they're handling the shortened form. Again, I want to ask

03:17:05.320 --> 03:17:15.160
him quickly. Well, I'm sorry. I just see Tony Alpert sitting here and I thought maybe we would

03:17:15.160 --> 03:17:21.000
ask him. Oh, yes. Tony, if he knows what's happening with the other states so that we

03:17:21.000 --> 03:17:29.080
could get a quick answer. Yes, Madam President. So I think Mao described it accurately. The states

03:17:29.080 --> 03:17:37.640
are looking at the blueprint options. The states voted on the blueprint that Mao has presented

03:17:38.520 --> 03:17:45.400
to the board for its consideration. And then states have the option of using that blueprint

03:17:45.400 --> 03:17:53.080
or using the full form or it is their option to deviate and use some other blueprint. But

03:17:53.800 --> 03:17:58.680
given that this is one of the blueprints that Smarter Balanced has adopted, it would be a

03:17:58.680 --> 03:18:03.560
blueprint that Smarter Balanced supports as part of its technical manual, its collection of validity

03:18:03.560 --> 03:18:12.120
evidence and the data that it collects around it. Thank you. That was helpful. Okay. Patricia,

03:18:12.120 --> 03:18:17.480
one more clarifying question and then we'll complete the item. Well, I'm glad I was last on

03:18:17.480 --> 03:18:23.400
this because I did have a number of questions about the blueprint list itself. Could you go back to

03:18:23.400 --> 03:18:29.960
the slide showing the difference in the number of assessment items? Because I do have a couple of

03:18:30.040 --> 03:18:34.920
questions remaining. And then when we get to the general discussion, I'll ask the Smarter Balanced

03:18:35.640 --> 03:18:42.600
logistical questions there. My first question is, I heard that there would be a difference

03:18:43.400 --> 03:18:49.960
in the error that would be given. And first of all, let me just say, I found it amusing

03:18:49.960 --> 03:18:54.200
when your colleague came up to the podium, the camera had to make an adjustment because he was

03:18:54.200 --> 03:18:59.000
so much taller than you. I had a hard time not laughing about that, but that's separate. So I

03:18:59.000 --> 03:19:04.920
did hear that there was a difference in error and that error is likely to increase with giving

03:19:04.920 --> 03:19:15.000
the test. My next question is, so does the scale also change with the reduction of items

03:19:15.000 --> 03:19:19.320
that are on this assessment if we go to this alternative blueprint?

03:19:19.400 --> 03:19:19.900
Okay.

03:19:23.640 --> 03:19:27.640
So I will have Tony, can you assist with that question?

03:19:31.560 --> 03:19:40.520
Board member Rucker, so we do not plan on changing the scale and we will provide evidence

03:19:40.520 --> 03:19:48.360
as part of the data collection that it is in fact a comparable use or comparable scale from

03:19:49.800 --> 03:19:56.200
previous administrations. So that's an evidence that would be included as part of the technical

03:19:56.200 --> 03:20:02.360
analysis. Okay. And then my last question is related to the depth of knowledge. With the

03:20:02.360 --> 03:20:07.640
large number of assessment items on the full assessment, both for reading language arts and

03:20:07.640 --> 03:20:14.040
math, there is a great deal of diversity or variability in the depth of knowledge required

03:20:14.040 --> 03:20:20.200
for the students to explore and actually develop the answers for in their responses for these

03:20:20.200 --> 03:20:28.040
questions. Could you go to the math blueprint? So I'm concerned when we look at the math blueprint

03:20:28.040 --> 03:20:34.680
with the reduction of items, there would be one or one to two problem solving questions

03:20:34.680 --> 03:20:39.800
and up to two modeling and data analysis questions. I'm especially concerned in

03:20:39.800 --> 03:20:47.160
mathematics because this is the area that we have a statewide performance issue that mathematics

03:20:47.160 --> 03:20:54.040
is almost uniformly the lowest test score that students are receiving across the grade levels

03:20:54.760 --> 03:21:01.720
and grade spans that we're testing and across districts. And while the state does have separately

03:21:01.720 --> 03:21:09.160
and a priority on providing a new professional development and new instructional support

03:21:09.160 --> 03:21:17.080
to teachers to help increase the performance of students, I'm concerned about what the actual math

03:21:17.080 --> 03:21:22.920
assessment is going to tell us if two of the areas where we're doing a lot of work to revise

03:21:22.920 --> 03:21:29.480
the math framework really will not be well explored in this alternative assessment. And I

03:21:29.480 --> 03:21:35.160
and I'm just raising the question knowing that this is just going to be a one-time thing,

03:21:35.160 --> 03:21:43.080
but I'm not sure, Tony, on what the relative value of the math score will be given, you know,

03:21:43.080 --> 03:21:47.560
what's actually going to be tested and we're not clear on what the depth of knowledge of those

03:21:47.560 --> 03:21:53.640
questions are. So could we talk a little bit or think a little bit about giving guidance to the

03:21:53.640 --> 03:22:00.360
LEAs about what this score will mean or what they should glean from the data they're going to get

03:22:00.360 --> 03:22:05.320
from this score? Because I think that they're going, districts are going to need more help

03:22:05.320 --> 03:22:11.000
with figuring this out even with the diagnostic work they should be doing with the formative

03:22:11.000 --> 03:22:15.960
assessments. I'm not really sure they're going to know what to do with this information knowing

03:22:15.960 --> 03:22:21.960
that there was only one or two items on what is proving to be some of their most difficult

03:22:21.960 --> 03:22:28.040
instructional areas. I hope that question makes sense. Yeah, I think we're getting into the

03:22:28.040 --> 03:22:33.080
discussion now. It's a great question. I don't know if there's a quick answer

03:22:33.080 --> 03:22:36.280
now and then we can delve back into it when we get to discussion.

03:22:38.200 --> 03:22:41.720
If I'm really about the depth of knowledge, really respond to the depth of knowledge.

03:22:41.720 --> 03:22:44.840
We can get to the detail of the other part of the question, but I really

03:22:44.840 --> 03:22:47.160
don't want to understand what would be the depth of knowledge.

03:22:47.160 --> 03:22:52.120
So the depth of knowledge for problem solving and data analysis is really addressed principally

03:22:52.120 --> 03:23:12.040
for math in the performance tasks. And so those were retained. And in the aggregate, I think that

03:23:12.520 --> 03:23:20.200
the power of the summative assessment, even in the shortened form, is retained. And to at least

03:23:20.200 --> 03:23:28.200
start at your question, Smarter Balanced acknowledges and I personally acknowledge our need

03:23:28.840 --> 03:23:37.320
to augment and support the interpretation of the results in a new way and for a variety of reasons,

03:23:37.320 --> 03:23:42.360
not just due to the shortened blueprint, but because of all the context of the data

03:23:42.920 --> 03:23:48.120
that has to be taken into consideration. I certainly appreciate your response to that.

03:23:48.120 --> 03:23:51.880
Thank you so very much. Great. Thank you.

03:23:53.160 --> 03:23:57.080
Seeing no other clarifying questions now, why don't you go ahead with the rest of the item?

03:23:57.800 --> 03:24:02.840
Okay. Thank you. So as you know, the development, as I mentioned earlier,

03:24:02.840 --> 03:24:09.480
the development of the alternate LPAC has been ongoing. And the initial, the development,

03:24:09.480 --> 03:24:16.600
the initial and summative alternate LPAC student score reports is the most recent step

03:24:17.640 --> 03:24:26.440
in that process. So let's begin. It really began last spring. So the work began with two

03:24:26.440 --> 03:24:34.680
parent focus groups, one in April and one in May. And the participants were provided with a sample

03:24:34.680 --> 03:24:41.080
alternate LPAC student score report, translated into Spanish and Mandarin and asked to provide

03:24:41.080 --> 03:24:47.960
feedback on its readability and usability. And these parents at least have at least one English

03:24:47.960 --> 03:24:56.040
learner student with an individualized education plan, education program. So for the first meeting,

03:24:56.040 --> 03:25:00.520
we focused on Spanish speaking parents and guardians because Spanish is the language

03:25:01.080 --> 03:25:05.240
that is most common for English learners with the significant cognitive disabilities.

03:25:06.280 --> 03:25:12.120
And for the second meeting, we included Mandarin speaking parents and guardians and provided feedback

03:25:12.120 --> 03:25:17.800
and collected feedback from them as well. Then in July, a focus group was conducted with

03:25:17.800 --> 03:25:23.960
representatives from a number of California stakeholder groups to provide feedback on the

03:25:23.960 --> 03:25:30.600
design elements of the alternate LPAC student score reports, ability to communicate the results

03:25:30.600 --> 03:25:35.720
to parents, students and guardians. And some of these stakeholder groups included the Small School

03:25:35.720 --> 03:25:42.360
District Association, the Association of California School Administrators, the California School

03:25:42.360 --> 03:25:48.360
Boards Association, the California Teachers Association, the California Federation of Teachers,

03:25:48.920 --> 03:25:56.280
the California County Superintendent's Educational Services Association, and the California Science

03:25:56.280 --> 03:26:08.440
Teachers Association. So having the feedback collected from the focus groups, the first component

03:26:08.440 --> 03:26:14.920
was to make sure that the graphics would contribute to the test results being easy to understand.

03:26:15.560 --> 03:26:20.440
And the next component was to make sure that terminology and language would be clear and

03:26:20.440 --> 03:26:26.200
understandable to parents and guardians. And then the student score report also needed to identify

03:26:26.200 --> 03:26:32.040
the skills that are needed to help the child progress along with an explanation of the child's

03:26:32.040 --> 03:26:40.280
abilities. And the last component was that from the parents and guardians and stakeholders,

03:26:40.280 --> 03:26:47.160
they recommended including links to sample test questions and available resources. So all in all,

03:26:47.160 --> 03:26:52.520
the feedback was good and provided us with the ability to bring forward the alternate

03:26:53.800 --> 03:26:57.880
LPAC student score reports that meet the feedback from these focus groups.

03:27:01.640 --> 03:27:04.520
So the alternate LPAC SSR details

03:27:04.520 --> 03:27:11.880
that once approved, these student score reports will become available for both,

03:27:11.880 --> 03:27:17.400
for use for both the initial alternate LPAC and the summative alternate LPAC,

03:27:17.400 --> 03:27:24.920
which are planned to be operational starting in July 2020. They will be available in five languages,

03:27:25.800 --> 03:27:32.520
English, Spanish, Mandarin, Vietnamese, and Filipino. And finally, these student score

03:27:32.600 --> 03:27:36.760
reports will provide universal access to the information for persons

03:27:38.120 --> 03:27:41.480
with visual impairments through text-to-speech applications.

03:27:44.200 --> 03:27:48.040
So this screenshot displays the front side of the initial alternate LPAC

03:27:48.840 --> 03:27:54.360
student score report. The pop-out image displays the overall score and the proficiency level.

03:27:55.480 --> 03:28:02.120
And this is the backside of the report. The pop-out displays the descriptions of the three

03:28:02.120 --> 03:28:06.760
different proficiency levels that are reported by the initial alternate LPAC.

03:28:09.880 --> 03:28:14.280
And then here's the proposed summative alternate LPAC student score report

03:28:14.280 --> 03:28:20.680
front side. And the pop-out image displays the overall score and the proficiency level.

03:28:21.240 --> 03:28:28.760
And then on the back, it shows the, the pop-out here displays the overall score,

03:28:28.760 --> 03:28:34.040
the proficiency level, and a comparison to previous years, if available.

03:28:36.280 --> 03:28:44.920
So I'm nearing the end. So just to recap, the CDE's recommendations for the California State

03:28:44.920 --> 03:28:51.000
Board of Education are to approve the proposed revisions to the Smarter Balanced

03:28:51.000 --> 03:28:57.240
Summative Assessments for English Language Arts, Literacy or ELA, and Mathematics Blueprints,

03:28:58.040 --> 03:29:05.000
as described in Tables 2 and 4 in order to allow for short test forms. And the, and approve the

03:29:05.000 --> 03:29:11.880
proposed student score reports for the initial and summative alternate LPAC or English Language

03:29:11.880 --> 03:29:19.480
Proficiency Assessments for California, as described in Attachment 2.

03:29:34.280 --> 03:29:35.800
Linda, I'm sorry. I think you're on mute.

03:29:35.800 --> 03:29:44.600
I've been talking to myself on mute way too much. We're going to open the phone line for

03:29:44.600 --> 03:29:49.080
public comments. So we want to get the slide up for public comment queue.

03:29:50.040 --> 03:29:54.680
Members of the public wishing to provide comment on this item may do so by calling the phone number

03:29:55.240 --> 03:30:00.600
and using the access code on that slide. And while we're waiting for members of the public

03:30:00.600 --> 03:30:06.200
to call in, I want to ask Linda's son if she has any initial comments before I add mine,

03:30:06.200 --> 03:30:14.840
and then we'll move to the public comment. Yeah, I just wanted to say that I think it

03:30:14.840 --> 03:30:20.360
is really important that we have this conversation around the summative assessments

03:30:20.360 --> 03:30:27.000
that we're looking at for the spring of this year. As Deputy Superintendent Maeve said

03:30:27.640 --> 03:30:34.920
in her introductory remarks, that we don't know what the spring will bring us and what it will

03:30:34.920 --> 03:30:43.320
take. We need to start working on preparing for whatever it might be. So I think this would be

03:30:43.320 --> 03:30:50.040
the first step in looking at a shortened blueprint for the summative assessments.

03:30:50.600 --> 03:30:57.400
Yeah, and I'll just echo Ting's comments and note again that

03:30:58.680 --> 03:31:05.560
this gives us an option we may need, and it has to get started now if we're going to have that

03:31:05.560 --> 03:31:15.320
option. But there will be much unpredictable in the coming months. And so there, I want to be

03:31:15.320 --> 03:31:21.720
clear that if there are questions, as I've heard many about things like waivers that might pertain

03:31:21.720 --> 03:31:28.920
to assessment or accountability to various tests, et cetera, of those we will not be taking up right

03:31:28.920 --> 03:31:35.240
this minute. This is really just about these items because they are timely and necessary at this

03:31:35.240 --> 03:31:45.000
moment. And we will continue to be responsive to the environment around us as we need to be beyond

03:31:45.960 --> 03:31:51.080
this. And with that, I think we can open it up for public comment. Is there any public comment?

03:31:52.280 --> 03:31:59.720
Yes, we currently we have four callers in the queue. And first caller, please state your name

03:31:59.720 --> 03:32:03.800
and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:32:07.080 --> 03:32:11.000
Good afternoon. This is Edgar Sotsueta on behalf of the Association of California School

03:32:11.000 --> 03:32:16.600
Administrators. I just wanted to state that we support the recommendation. We think it strikes

03:32:16.600 --> 03:32:22.680
the right balance on ensuring health and safety of our students and staff while also allowing us to

03:32:22.680 --> 03:32:30.040
get some information and data that will enable us to support our students from an academic standpoint.

03:32:30.040 --> 03:32:36.520
We do have two requests from the state. One is that the state takes the lead on the communications

03:32:36.520 --> 03:32:40.600
front. Our members, our school leaders are going to be the ones who are going to have to explain

03:32:40.600 --> 03:32:45.400
to parents the changes and why we're making these changes. So just getting some uniform

03:32:45.400 --> 03:32:50.440
communications from the state would be helpful. And then two, as it's been stated, the system will

03:32:50.440 --> 03:32:58.040
need support in implementation of the assessments, dealing on the issues of security, administrating

03:32:58.040 --> 03:33:02.360
the assessments across the different modes of instruction, and then it's been stated just how

03:33:02.360 --> 03:33:07.480
to use the data once we get that information. So thank you for the discussion and for the action

03:33:07.480 --> 03:33:14.680
today. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time

03:33:14.680 --> 03:33:25.000
starts now. Hello, I'm Dr. Ingrid Lines-Robertson, Chief of Learning and Accountability at Alameda

03:33:25.000 --> 03:33:31.000
County Office of Education. On behalf of SESPA, the California County Superintendent's Education

03:33:31.000 --> 03:33:36.840
Services Association, consisting of 58 county superintendents of schools, we appreciate the

03:33:36.840 --> 03:33:41.640
California Department of Education for proposing revisions to the English Language Arts and

03:33:41.640 --> 03:33:47.400
Mathematics Blueprint to allow for a short test form. The 58 counties look forward to working

03:33:47.400 --> 03:33:53.080
with CDE in providing ongoing support to our districts and schools on implementation issues

03:33:53.080 --> 03:33:59.240
given distance learning, such as the need for additional devices for at-home administration,

03:33:59.240 --> 03:34:05.080
the need to provide video training in multiple languages for parents and families to be able to

03:34:05.080 --> 03:34:10.680
administer the short test form at home, the need for teachers and parents to know that scores are

03:34:10.680 --> 03:34:15.560
a reliable measure of student knowledge and understanding of state standards. SESPA is

03:34:15.560 --> 03:34:24.280
committed to partnering with CDE in the best interest of students. Thank you caller. Next

03:34:24.280 --> 03:34:29.000
caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:34:29.240 --> 03:34:34.520
Hi, my name is Angela DeRamos and I am a fifth grade teacher representing California Teachers

03:34:34.520 --> 03:34:40.680
Association. CTA appreciates the CDE's efforts to be prepared for a variety of scenarios given

03:34:40.680 --> 03:34:45.960
COVID-19 this year. And while we understand why there are efforts to develop the short form for

03:34:45.960 --> 03:34:52.120
the CASP and LPAC, CTA strongly implores the State Board of Education and the CDE to pursue

03:34:52.120 --> 03:34:57.000
a waiver for the required administration of the CASP for the spring of 2015.

03:34:57.320 --> 03:35:03.000
of the CASP for the spring of 2021. Given widespread inequities in student access to

03:35:03.000 --> 03:35:08.280
technology and the internet, as well as concerns about validity and the comparability of any data

03:35:08.280 --> 03:35:13.640
gathered in some statewide summative testing administered in this condition, because there are

03:35:13.640 --> 03:35:18.600
unknown and uncontrollable conditions, conducting standardized testing in the spring of 2021 would

03:35:18.600 --> 03:35:23.720
be documented to students and limited use to teachers, schools, and school districts.

03:35:23.720 --> 03:35:27.240
CTA is supportive of the exclusion of the LPAC from the waiver,

03:35:27.240 --> 03:35:30.360
since it's used to reclassify English learners. Thank you.

03:35:31.960 --> 03:35:37.320
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time

03:35:37.320 --> 03:35:46.600
starts now. Hi, I'm Robert Van Waring calling from Children Now. Thank you for bringing this

03:35:46.600 --> 03:35:52.200
item to the board. Just wanted to raise a couple of issues to be considered as you make this

03:35:52.200 --> 03:35:59.160
decision. Getting a better sense of how this test, would this test meet the needs

03:35:59.960 --> 03:36:06.920
in the English learner reclassification process? Generally, the summative test is one of those

03:36:06.920 --> 03:36:12.520
indicators, one of the four main indicators used in that reclassification decision. And then

03:36:12.520 --> 03:36:16.200
thinking about what are the implications that this might have for the growth model that you'll

03:36:16.200 --> 03:36:23.240
discuss in the next item? Would there be the ability to have a comparability at some point

03:36:23.240 --> 03:36:31.240
on a student level basis between a short form result in spring 2021 with a long form result in

03:36:31.240 --> 03:36:38.680
2022? Or will this lead to a further delay of the start of the growth model? And then finally,

03:36:38.680 --> 03:36:44.520
to the extent that there may be a potential waiver in the future, really thinking about

03:36:44.520 --> 03:36:51.960
how is the state head around learning loss in the state? Thank you. Thank you, caller.

03:36:51.960 --> 03:36:57.240
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:37:02.840 --> 03:37:11.320
Good afternoon. This is Liz Guillen with Public Advocates. I am speaking to the comments from the

03:37:11.320 --> 03:37:17.640
LCFF Equity Coalition. I appreciate very much the presentation today and the acknowledgement

03:37:17.640 --> 03:37:23.720
that so much is unknown. And also good to know that the department engaged in parent outreach.

03:37:23.720 --> 03:37:29.240
And I'll urge the department to take the recommendations of those parents very seriously.

03:37:30.280 --> 03:37:35.000
One question we have is how will the dashboard be modified to reflect the changes to the test?

03:37:35.640 --> 03:37:43.080
And echoing the prior speaker's question, what will be the impact to the rollout of the student

03:37:43.080 --> 03:37:48.760
growth model? Given the changes in the learning modes that students and their families are

03:37:48.760 --> 03:37:55.640
experiencing in distance learning, we know that accommodations and assessments that address

03:37:55.640 --> 03:37:59.880
students' needs, especially those with unique needs who are having the greatest struggles,

03:38:00.440 --> 03:38:05.240
they need to be addressed head on. And we hope that the department, and we urge you to

03:38:05.880 --> 03:38:13.240
urge the department to plan strongly for ensuring that this is done well and equitably. Thank you.

03:38:13.240 --> 03:38:19.400
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:38:24.120 --> 03:38:28.040
Good afternoon. This is Sarah Lilas, Executive Director for Teach Plus California.

03:38:28.840 --> 03:38:33.080
We just wanted to share some thoughts as you consider moving forward with this recommendation

03:38:33.080 --> 03:38:39.000
about the role of the state in doing this. And one to reinforce a point that Ms. Guillen just made

03:38:39.000 --> 03:38:44.440
is how do we as a state ensure all students have an equitable and adequate testing environment?

03:38:44.440 --> 03:38:51.880
And so we urge the department to dig even deeper into what we're learning from the administration

03:38:51.880 --> 03:38:58.440
of the initial LPAC, where there are LEAs that are struggling with that, and where there could

03:38:58.440 --> 03:39:03.880
be additional resources coming from the state. In addition, we urge you to think about how you,

03:39:03.880 --> 03:39:11.560
again, as Mr. Sveta mentioned, how you communicate the rollout of these assessments with not only

03:39:11.560 --> 03:39:17.000
educators, but families and students and the role of these moving forward. Thank you very much.

03:39:17.800 --> 03:39:22.360
Thank you, caller. This concludes public comment. Thank you, callers.

03:39:24.520 --> 03:39:33.720
Okay, now we're ready for discussion, and we'll try to get to the most meaningful questions as

03:39:33.720 --> 03:39:41.240
quickly as we can. I do want to use the prerogative of the chair to ask the question that several

03:39:41.960 --> 03:39:49.240
public comment callers did ask about the implications of the short form for the

03:39:49.240 --> 03:39:53.400
growth model. I think that's something that everyone will want to know the answer to.

03:39:54.680 --> 03:40:05.640
And I know that Dr. Vang has really been looking at the questions of how remote testing,

03:40:05.640 --> 03:40:13.000
online testing, bringing kids into small groups, and other things may work. So if

03:40:13.000 --> 03:40:18.760
you want to say a word about the variable strategies that might end up being activated,

03:40:18.760 --> 03:40:24.440
that would be helpful, too. And others, please raise your hands, and I will watch for those in

03:40:24.440 --> 03:40:32.840
the participants. Linda, that question was for me about how we implemented the LPAC.

03:40:33.800 --> 03:40:37.000
Well, the first question is the implications for the growth model,

03:40:37.720 --> 03:40:44.760
if we know those. And the second is just a brief word on what we're learning about

03:40:45.400 --> 03:40:53.400
assessment in this online environment. Okay, so again, like I mentioned earlier,

03:40:53.400 --> 03:40:59.400
we just don't know what kind of results we will get, right, because of the unknowns of students

03:40:59.480 --> 03:41:06.840
taking the test. And so as we analyze the data, we can't really make a definitive answer

03:41:07.880 --> 03:41:13.400
how it can be used for the growth model or anything else until we go through the process.

03:41:14.120 --> 03:41:19.800
And should we, you know, learn that we need to decouple it from accountability

03:41:21.400 --> 03:41:27.480
purposes, then we could do that at a later time when we have more information and data collected.

03:41:29.720 --> 03:41:35.240
I'm not sure if Eric or Cindy is here, if either one of you want to add on to the accountability

03:41:35.240 --> 03:41:39.880
questions. Sure, good afternoon. Cindy Kazanis, the Director of the Analysis,

03:41:39.880 --> 03:41:43.800
Measurement, and Accountability Reporting Division. We are working directly with

03:41:43.800 --> 03:41:48.600
Educational Testing Services on the growth model, as you all know, and you'll hear in the next item.

03:41:48.600 --> 03:41:55.560
And so if anything, they are closely evaluating this as we move along. So should the board take

03:41:55.560 --> 03:42:01.960
action today on shortening the form of the test, we will definitely be in continued contact with

03:42:01.960 --> 03:42:08.200
them on how this would impact the growth model. So as we bring forward future considerations of

03:42:08.200 --> 03:42:11.640
the growth model and the actual adoption in March, this will definitely be a part of that

03:42:11.640 --> 03:42:16.360
conversation. So I think now is correct, it's too early, but it's definitely on our radar.

03:42:18.280 --> 03:42:22.680
All right, I know that we have questions from Sue, Patricia, and Cynthia.

03:42:26.280 --> 03:42:30.040
In that order? Yes, we'll do it in that order.

03:42:30.040 --> 03:42:34.680
All right, thanks. So just a couple things. First, I just want to express my appreciation

03:42:34.680 --> 03:42:40.920
to both Rachel and Mao for their presentation. As somebody who's been around testing for a long,

03:42:40.920 --> 03:42:46.280
long time, when I saw this item, I thought it needed a lot of background information.

03:42:46.280 --> 03:42:51.240
And I hope, especially for our new members, that providing the kind of background that Mao did

03:42:51.240 --> 03:42:58.360
about the scope of the testing writ large and the time it takes for testing was helpful.

03:42:58.360 --> 03:43:03.720
So again, thank you very much for doing that. But to that point, I guess I understand the

03:43:03.720 --> 03:43:10.360
short-term need here to try to get on the road with blueprints that will shorten the test for

03:43:10.360 --> 03:43:17.560
English language arts and mathematics. But as I look at the PowerPoint, and Mao, you might want

03:43:17.560 --> 03:43:24.040
to put up one of the earlier slides about what, again, CASP entails, the umbrella of CASP,

03:43:24.040 --> 03:43:29.640
it includes a lot of other assessments. And if one of our objectives here is to try to be

03:43:31.480 --> 03:43:37.640
planning ahead and thinking about, because there are so many unknowns, should we also be looking

03:43:37.640 --> 03:43:42.840
at some of these other assessments? And I think especially about CASP, the science assessment,

03:43:42.840 --> 03:43:49.400
since that's rolling out relatively newly, is that something that we should be considerate of?

03:43:49.400 --> 03:43:56.760
Because again, if one of our initial, our rationales is to try to reduce the amount of time

03:43:56.760 --> 03:44:02.520
spent on testing, given all of the other demands that are on our educators at this time, I just

03:44:02.520 --> 03:44:07.320
want to make sure that we're thinking about this whole issue in a broader context. And not just

03:44:07.320 --> 03:44:11.960
because, and it's not just because, but I feel like we're trying to respond like we do a lot

03:44:11.960 --> 03:44:18.120
of times to the feds, because we think the feds won't give us a waiver. I just want us to have

03:44:18.120 --> 03:44:24.200
a broader discussion about assessment in the context in which we're trying to ask our educators

03:44:24.200 --> 03:44:35.640
to operate. Thank you. Mao, did you want to speak to that? Yes, well, the science test is also required

03:44:35.720 --> 03:44:48.760
under ESSA. That is not something that I could just recommend to reduce or take out. And with the

03:44:48.760 --> 03:44:58.760
timing, it is already a much shorter test than the ELA. And at this point, we think the only

03:44:58.760 --> 03:45:04.600
two that we could reduce in a meaningful way, in a timely way, is the ELA and the MAC,

03:45:05.400 --> 03:45:13.560
or are the ELA and the MAC? I think the question of what we'll face in the spring and whether

03:45:15.800 --> 03:45:20.280
there will be a change in administration, which we'll learn in the next few days, and what the

03:45:21.000 --> 03:45:27.240
framework will be for thinking about spring testing will all become clearer in the coming

03:45:27.240 --> 03:45:32.360
days and weeks than it is right now. But I think that's a really good question to keep in front of

03:45:32.360 --> 03:45:40.440
us. Patricia, you're next, and then Cynthia, then Eileen. Well, thank you. I want to begin by saying

03:45:40.440 --> 03:45:47.000
I agree wholeheartedly with what Board Member Burr just said, so I'm glad that I was called to

03:45:47.000 --> 03:45:51.800
speak after her, because I was going to say many of the same things. The questions that I raised

03:45:51.800 --> 03:45:57.320
during the technical part of the discussion about the scale and about the depth of knowledge and

03:45:57.320 --> 03:46:04.920
how these would be comparable and fit overall into what's reported and evaluated by schools

03:46:04.920 --> 03:46:10.760
and ultimately by parents was related to that concern. So I was heartened, and I'm very grateful

03:46:10.760 --> 03:46:16.600
that Tony Alford is on the call today to be able to talk to and recognize that there is a need to

03:46:16.600 --> 03:46:24.920
change not only what we're doing and how we are doing the assessments because of the circumstances

03:46:24.920 --> 03:46:30.680
we're in, but how we discuss and report and analyze the results we're getting. So I'm glad to know

03:46:30.680 --> 03:46:36.520
that that conversation is on the table. But again, I want to reiterate what Board Member Burr said

03:46:36.520 --> 03:46:41.960
for the purposes of what we are trying to do as a board and the policy that we're trying to create

03:46:41.960 --> 03:46:48.520
and a focus on continuous improvement and in particular with what we're trying to do in

03:46:48.520 --> 03:46:54.440
addressing our statewide concern about the performance of students in math and what their

03:46:54.440 --> 03:47:03.800
math learning actually is. I think this conversation about assessment is taking on a greater context

03:47:03.880 --> 03:47:12.040
in that overall big picture. So I will leave it there. Okay, thank you. Cynthia.

03:47:13.480 --> 03:47:19.880
Thank you. I first would like to say again, and it's kind of been said already before,

03:47:19.880 --> 03:47:26.760
that it is really important that this type of decision is looked at at this time in case

03:47:26.840 --> 03:47:33.800
it is needed. To be able to implement spring testing administration at any point in time

03:47:33.800 --> 03:47:39.400
always requires a lot of logistics on the behalf of school districts and schools. And if that is

03:47:39.400 --> 03:47:45.320
going to indeed need to happen this spring, especially in light of the fact that students

03:47:45.320 --> 03:47:52.440
are primarily in a distance learning environment and may be transitioning after the winter breaks

03:47:52.440 --> 03:47:58.200
into perhaps a hybrid type of model. There are a lot of logistical decisions

03:47:58.200 --> 03:48:04.680
that need to be made. So I'm very happy that we are looking at this at this point in time

03:48:04.680 --> 03:48:11.560
and really keeping that in mind for everyone in the field. As we move forward, if it is determined

03:48:11.560 --> 03:48:20.360
and if the board does vote to utilize the more reduced size blueprint for spring administration,

03:48:21.320 --> 03:48:30.360
it is going to be very important that we look at some guidance that can come from CDE regarding

03:48:30.360 --> 03:48:39.160
communication of the shortened format and what that means. Perhaps even a communications toolkit

03:48:39.800 --> 03:48:48.440
that LEAs can then use to communicate at their local level to their stakeholders.

03:48:49.240 --> 03:48:55.240
A uniform communication will be really important with this particular change.

03:48:56.120 --> 03:49:03.160
The other aspect of consideration where I think there may need to be again some guidance that

03:49:03.160 --> 03:49:11.400
again LEAs can use at their local context is in regards to various administration models.

03:49:12.040 --> 03:49:18.200
If this is going to be, spring testing is going to take place in a mode that is very different

03:49:18.200 --> 03:49:24.120
from what we've done before and that's what we are anticipating. To have again some type of

03:49:24.120 --> 03:49:31.800
guidance document on models that can be utilized in different situations for schools that are smaller,

03:49:31.800 --> 03:49:38.440
schools that are larger, elementary, middle, high school. That I also feel will be very helpful

03:49:39.000 --> 03:49:45.800
for those in the field as they make decisions about how to go about ensuring students have

03:49:45.800 --> 03:49:50.520
a spring testing environment that will best set them up for success.

03:49:51.640 --> 03:49:57.640
It's really important if I could just note that some places are operating with very strong

03:49:59.160 --> 03:50:09.160
bandwidth and internet capacity, others not. It's very hard for kids to get through long

03:50:10.120 --> 03:50:17.320
assignments on Zoom. Some places are in person, others are not. Some places are bringing students

03:50:17.320 --> 03:50:25.000
back in small groups. That might even be the context for assessment in some places in the spring.

03:50:25.720 --> 03:50:34.600
So having an assessment that can be managed in all of those different contexts in a reasonable way

03:50:34.600 --> 03:50:43.320
way is important to consider and then of course the guidance about how contingencies in different

03:50:43.320 --> 03:50:51.560
circumstances might be handled will be helpful. Eileen? Well, I just want to build on previous

03:50:51.560 --> 03:50:56.120
all the board members comments so far. I appreciate the advanced planning. I know we have to do it

03:50:56.120 --> 03:51:02.200
this month and if we want to be ready for spring testing. I think the issues about access to

03:51:02.200 --> 03:51:06.760
bandwidth. I just think about the stories of advanced placement students who took a short

03:51:06.760 --> 03:51:12.040
form and then couldn't upload their exam and then they had to retake it again and all the anxiety.

03:51:12.040 --> 03:51:18.760
So I do and I know that we're continuing to work on this but whether it will be in remote which

03:51:18.760 --> 03:51:24.600
has its own challenges or in small group in person, we've never given these tests remotely

03:51:24.600 --> 03:51:31.320
before. I appreciate the short form and I appreciate the desire to align and to get some

03:51:31.320 --> 03:51:35.880
good data feedback on where our students are but I realize that as we look forward and we don't

03:51:35.880 --> 03:51:40.040
know what spring will look like in our schools. I know we're all hoping students will be back at

03:51:40.040 --> 03:51:47.800
least some of the time. I'm assuming that the guidance from CD will include the settings and

03:51:47.800 --> 03:51:52.760
the options that we will have to administer to get valid and reliable and also to give students

03:51:52.760 --> 03:51:58.200
a fair chance to show what they know without being cut off the bandwidth or having unable to

03:51:58.200 --> 03:52:03.480
upload an answer. So I just think it's complicated. I appreciate the advanced planning so that we're

03:52:03.480 --> 03:52:11.400
ready in case we have to do this but I do believe we need some clear benchmark of where our students

03:52:11.400 --> 03:52:17.080
are but I don't want to overly complicate and make it frustrating for them in the challenges

03:52:17.080 --> 03:52:23.720
that we're facing right now with remote and hybrid learning. I think that's a good point at which to

03:52:23.720 --> 03:52:28.840
I don't see any other hands up for discussion so I think this is the moment where we ask for a motion

03:52:31.720 --> 03:52:41.320
to have a motion regarding the CDE recommendations. A motion. Matt, thank you.

03:52:41.320 --> 03:52:48.840
We have a motion. We have a second. Any further discussion? I'll ask Brooks to call the roll.

03:52:49.560 --> 03:53:03.160
Member Burr. Aye. President Darlene Hammond. Aye. Member Fatah. Aye. Member Glover-Woods. Aye.

03:53:03.400 --> 03:53:14.200
Member McQuillan. Yes. Member Navo. Aye. Member Patil-Brownson. Aye. Member Rodriguez.

03:53:15.320 --> 03:53:25.800
Aye. Member Rucker. Yes. Vice President Strauss. Aye. Member Sun. Aye. It's unanimous.

03:53:26.520 --> 03:53:33.560
All right. Thank you very much, Mal. We appreciate the presentation. We have earned ourselves a lunch time.

03:53:34.440 --> 03:53:41.160
It's 1240. We'll come back in a half an hour at 1 10. See you then. Thank you. I think you want to

03:53:41.160 --> 03:53:46.440
leave. Stay in the meeting but stop your video and put yourself on mute.

03:53:46.440 --> 03:53:58.120
We're going to reestablish a quorum so Brooks is going to call the roll.

03:54:00.040 --> 03:54:06.360
Member Burr. Here. President Darlene Hammond. Here. Member Fatah.

03:54:07.320 --> 03:54:12.200
Here. Member Glover-Woods. Here. Member McQuillan.

03:54:13.400 --> 03:54:24.520
Here. Member Navo. Here. Member Patil-Brownson. Here. Member Rodriguez. Here. Member Rucker.

03:54:25.480 --> 03:54:34.360
Present. Vice President Strauss. Here. Member Sun. Here. Thank you.

03:54:36.120 --> 03:54:43.720
Okay. So we're going to start now with agenda item number five. This is an update on the

03:54:43.720 --> 03:54:49.000
implementation of the integrated local state and federal accountability and continuous improvement

03:54:49.000 --> 03:54:54.280
system. The recommended action on revisions to the student growth model and reporting

03:54:54.360 --> 03:55:00.440
recommendations of the California advisory task force on alternative schools. And I'm going to

03:55:01.000 --> 03:55:07.400
this item will be presented by Cindy Kazanis from the CDE. Dr. Jorge Ruiz de Velasco of the

03:55:07.400 --> 03:55:13.880
California advisory task force on alternative schools. Diana Walsh-Royce of the Riverside County

03:55:13.880 --> 03:55:20.680
Office of Education. And Mike Ilic of the Corona Norco Unified School District. We'll start with

03:55:20.680 --> 03:55:26.280
Cindy. Please begin. Thank you. Good afternoon. I'm Cindy Kazanis, the Director of the Analysis,

03:55:26.280 --> 03:55:31.640
Measurement and Accountability Reporting Division. Very excited to present item five to you this

03:55:31.640 --> 03:55:36.440
afternoon. We have a couple of attachments we're going to walk through today and we're going to do

03:55:36.440 --> 03:55:42.920
them out of order. We'll take clarifying questions after each of the attachments from board members

03:55:42.920 --> 03:55:49.960
before moving to public comment at the very end. So first just to clarify what the board action is,

03:55:49.960 --> 03:55:54.760
the Department of Education recommends that the State Board of Education first confirm that the

03:55:54.760 --> 03:56:02.520
Empirical Best Linear Prediction or EBLIP model will only be used, will only use the same subject

03:56:02.520 --> 03:56:08.040
area when modeling student growth and number two maintain the current student level methodology

03:56:08.040 --> 03:56:13.000
which holds the same expectation for growth and for all student groups and allows comparisons of

03:56:13.000 --> 03:56:19.080
student group data. So with that we're going to start with attachment two and I'm going to

03:56:19.080 --> 03:56:27.160
briefly introduce this piece of the presentation to you. This is a review of a partnership and

03:56:27.160 --> 03:56:33.480
really the culmination of a report that was prepared under direction of Dr. Jorge Luis de Velasco

03:56:34.440 --> 03:56:40.760
who is at the Gardner Center for Youth and their Communities at Stanford University. Jorge was

03:56:40.760 --> 03:56:46.840
introduced to us back in 2017 by then President Kirst and what a relationship this has become.

03:56:47.800 --> 03:56:55.880
We have unlike any other subject area that we've participated in we had the benefit from this of

03:56:55.880 --> 03:57:02.840
Dr. Luis de Velasco's just extensive national knowledge California specific knowledge of our

03:57:02.840 --> 03:57:09.960
alternative schools population. In addition he was able to really persuade I think some of the top

03:57:09.960 --> 03:57:16.360
experts on practitioners in the field of alternative education to participate in this in this task force

03:57:16.360 --> 03:57:23.000
and accordingly what the department gained from it was such a great capacity and knowledge of

03:57:23.000 --> 03:57:32.520
students and practices of our most vulnerable schools and also students. In doing so I have

03:57:32.520 --> 03:57:38.280
to say we learned from a variety of folks on this all the way from our county offices of education

03:57:39.240 --> 03:57:43.480
the advisory commission on special education weighed in for our most vulnerable students

03:57:43.480 --> 03:57:49.080
with disabilities to the to another end of the spectrum where you have charter schools who really

03:57:49.080 --> 03:57:56.040
focus on credit recovery which is very unique population and so we had just a wide range of

03:57:56.040 --> 03:58:01.720
voices we've learned a tremendous amount as you can see in this report which again is a culmination

03:58:01.720 --> 03:58:08.760
of this work but finally I wanted to just mention as in my opening remarks is that we've raised the

03:58:08.760 --> 03:58:15.800
profile of these students the words DAS now means something folks know that are in education

03:58:15.800 --> 03:58:23.320
community and look at educational data we've added this to our standing reports on our website for

03:58:23.320 --> 03:58:31.080
data quest the an actual filter for alternative schools and so really the lexicon and mission

03:58:31.080 --> 03:58:36.040
I think has far exceeded what we thought it was going to do about four years ago so with that I'd

03:58:36.040 --> 03:58:42.440
like to turn it over to Dr. Luis de Velasco to begin the conversation and really introduce you

03:58:42.440 --> 03:58:47.880
to the work of this group and you're going to hear from two very practiced practitioners

03:58:47.880 --> 03:58:51.960
in this area to talk through what we've been doing and where we're headed

03:58:59.080 --> 03:59:01.000
Jorge yes

03:59:01.240 --> 03:59:08.360
I'm happy to be here all right well first of all thank you Cindy I've given me an introduction

03:59:08.360 --> 03:59:15.240
that's going to be a little bit hard to live up to but I really appreciate it and a Valentine

03:59:15.240 --> 03:59:22.680
to the state board from the task force in so far as this work is already in progress at the CDE

03:59:22.680 --> 03:59:27.640
the development of the dashboard and the implementation of of measures and two things

03:59:27.640 --> 03:59:34.440
that are really really have already caused a good deal of positive system change is the

03:59:34.440 --> 03:59:42.040
implementation of the one-year graduation rate this kind of change is going to this change in

03:59:42.040 --> 03:59:48.680
the indicator metric is will be will generate relevant and more actionable information for

03:59:48.680 --> 03:59:54.840
system leaders about one of the core functions of the alternative schools which is to get kids a

03:59:54.840 --> 04:00:03.560
second chance to a standard diploma the the other the other thing that that the task force has

04:00:03.560 --> 04:00:09.160
been very uniformly happy about is the work that Cindy and the department and the state

04:00:09.160 --> 04:00:14.520
board has been doing to add new and collect more information about the college and career

04:00:14.520 --> 04:00:20.600
readiness indicator this is important not just for accountability purposes but by adding these

04:00:20.600 --> 04:00:27.080
indicators and lifting them up in the system it's encouraging school and district leaders to put

04:00:27.080 --> 04:00:33.080
more of these opportunities in alternative schools the creation of the collection of data on

04:00:33.080 --> 04:00:37.720
completing state and federal jobs or pre-apprenticeships or student-led enterprises

04:00:38.840 --> 04:00:45.080
will not only create more opportunities for young people to connect to work and further

04:00:45.640 --> 04:00:51.960
education and to the diploma but is going to support the and has been implementing the support

04:00:51.960 --> 04:00:59.400
of cte pathway programs and integrated studies integrated courses of study in alternative schools

04:01:00.200 --> 04:01:05.000
and we're already seeing places like oakland and san bernardino and los angeles pave the way

04:01:05.720 --> 04:01:10.920
for this in their alternative schools i want to use just my remaining time to to to do to talk

04:01:10.920 --> 04:01:19.160
about two points before i hand it over to my my co-presenters mike and diana one is in the report

04:01:19.160 --> 04:01:25.240
there is the the next stage of work is to articulate something on the dashboard that would

04:01:25.240 --> 04:01:31.320
be an important local indicator and one of those the task force thought was super important was

04:01:31.320 --> 04:01:39.080
the creation of of a positive transition rate this rate would measure the percent of those students

04:01:39.080 --> 04:01:46.600
who age out of of alternative schools or otherwise leave alternative schools without a diploma

04:01:48.920 --> 04:01:55.880
we know from our data and from data that the cde has run for the for the task force

04:01:55.880 --> 04:02:02.840
that anywhere from that an average of 60 percent of seniors in alternative schools actually wind up

04:02:03.480 --> 04:02:11.240
graduating by the end of but what happens to the rest there many of those many kids

04:02:12.680 --> 04:02:19.560
which is it's a good indicator but many kids wind up aging out of the system or otherwise

04:02:19.560 --> 04:02:27.480
leaving and many of these kids tend to be foster youth english learners late entering immigrants

04:02:27.480 --> 04:02:32.120
expelled or incarcerated youth that have re-entered the system that are aging out

04:02:32.120 --> 04:02:37.560
and alternative schools do an important job of making sure that they don't exit to the street

04:02:37.560 --> 04:02:48.040
that they exit to positive transitions like for example exiting to to work programs like

04:02:48.040 --> 04:02:53.000
youth build that allow them to continue their path to a high school diploma to community college

04:02:53.000 --> 04:02:59.240
programs to adult education and to the growing number of charter schools that help with credit

04:02:59.240 --> 04:03:11.160
recovery adding this kind of indicator would honor student persistence in in persisting in

04:03:11.160 --> 04:03:17.560
their education beyond the k-12 system where they are they're turning 19 20 and 21 and it would

04:03:17.560 --> 04:03:23.960
also honor the schools and the principals and teachers who put the shoulder to the wheel to

04:03:23.960 --> 04:03:29.000
make sure that all their kids are either getting a diploma or if they're aging out that they're

04:03:29.000 --> 04:03:37.640
making positive transitions to continued education or work and education we know the system the way

04:03:37.640 --> 04:03:44.200
it's currently designed signals that these kids are either system failures or losers and but we

04:03:44.200 --> 04:03:50.600
know that in many schools 80 90 percent of them are actually making positive transitions and we

04:03:50.600 --> 04:03:55.960
should measure that to know what schools are doing a good job of it and not because we know it makes

04:03:55.960 --> 04:04:01.800
a big difference whether they make those kinds of transitions or exit to the street two other points

04:04:02.360 --> 04:04:09.480
that are related is the continuation schools still make up the lion's share and students in the lion

04:04:09.480 --> 04:04:16.840
sheriff of secondary school students and alternative ed right now as an artifact of an

04:04:16.840 --> 04:04:23.640
anachronism of an anachronism of history those schools continuation schools are limited to 15

04:04:23.640 --> 04:04:31.640
hours of of capture for apportionment rate which is half of the 30 hours per week that traditional

04:04:31.640 --> 04:04:38.360
high schools get this is a the and the fact is though that most districts continue to offer a

04:04:38.360 --> 04:04:42.040
full day of programming and they have to pull that money out of their general funds

04:04:42.760 --> 04:04:49.480
because they're not treated the same and this is an artifact of the 1950s and it signals that

04:04:49.480 --> 04:04:55.240
for many that the system has given up on the six percent of secondary school students in these

04:04:55.240 --> 04:05:01.720
schools and that those students don't merit the same level at least of investment as students in

04:05:01.720 --> 04:05:06.920
those traditional schools that failed them in the first place it's something that that needs to be

04:05:06.920 --> 04:05:15.080
fixed the other one is and i i'm hopeful that diana and mike will put a little more meat on this

04:05:15.080 --> 04:05:22.280
but we also know that and the system will generate better information about the disproportionate

04:05:22.280 --> 04:05:25.960
number of these alternative schools that wind up in the bottom five percent of performance

04:05:27.560 --> 04:05:36.200
right now we do not have either at the cde or in any of the counties or in any other intermediary

04:05:36.920 --> 04:05:43.320
a locus for best practices and for providing technical assistance and targeted assistance to

04:05:43.320 --> 04:05:48.040
these leaders of schools in alternative settings that is appropriate to their setting and that

04:05:48.040 --> 04:05:54.360
would really incentivize continuous learning and improvement it is a big gap in our technical

04:05:54.360 --> 04:06:00.600
assistance ability to to improve make system improvement particularly for for schools at the

04:06:00.600 --> 04:06:06.680
at the lowest end of performance i'm going to stop there and i'm going to hand it over to

04:06:07.800 --> 04:06:13.720
mike illic who is the administrative director for instructional support at corona norco unified

04:06:13.720 --> 04:06:20.920
school district and also a leader in access and options council mike good afternoon it's nice to be

04:06:21.640 --> 04:06:28.040
um i would uh i would like to just uh tail tail off of uh of what or he was talking about

04:06:28.040 --> 04:06:34.440
and because we do have the uh the new accountability system we have to have the staff

04:06:34.440 --> 04:06:41.400
that's going to be able to implement uh implement uh programs and procedures that would that would

04:06:41.400 --> 04:06:45.240
be successful for those schools and not necessarily end up at the bottom of the heap

04:06:45.880 --> 04:06:51.960
and not necessarily end up at the bottom of the heap and and what i'm talking about is is the

04:06:51.960 --> 04:06:59.400
the principal the principal is is is it has to provide effective leadership that is essential

04:06:59.400 --> 04:07:05.160
in schools so those principles they need to be they need to be at those alternative schools

04:07:05.160 --> 04:07:12.360
because they want to be there and not because they're at the tail end of their um career in

04:07:12.360 --> 04:07:18.760
some assistant principal role at some other site and this is given to them as a as a as a reward

04:07:18.760 --> 04:07:25.480
for graduate or for um for uh retirement same thing graduation retirement but anyway so um

04:07:26.680 --> 04:07:33.320
it so that that is a critical piece in that and then having that principal who sets the tone

04:07:33.320 --> 04:07:38.600
who impacts the school climate and student learning to be able to hire their own teachers

04:07:38.600 --> 04:07:44.040
and and so that those teachers are there for the specific reason of teaching these kids

04:07:44.040 --> 04:07:50.440
now getting a a teacher from a traditional site doesn't work they don't understand the student

04:07:50.440 --> 04:07:55.320
they don't they don't understand that piece because it's more than just the just delivering

04:07:55.320 --> 04:08:00.600
curriculum it's about meeting the student where they are and working with those issues and breaking

04:08:00.600 --> 04:08:08.440
down the barrier so that that student uh can can access the curriculum so giving giving

04:08:08.440 --> 04:08:14.200
principals autonomy is very very very important and we've seen in the past where that that hasn't

04:08:14.200 --> 04:08:19.720
happened and it's still it still doesn't happen but those schools that do very well have strong

04:08:19.720 --> 04:08:27.080
school leadership strong strong teachers and you know i've been on on many continuation school

04:08:27.080 --> 04:08:32.920
model continuation school visits and where the kids say this is like family this school is like

04:08:32.920 --> 04:08:38.920
family students are engaged they want to come to school because of the the uh the adult presence

04:08:38.920 --> 04:08:45.320
there that want to be there so i just i just really want to uh emphasize that because we've

04:08:45.320 --> 04:08:52.680
seen in data that there's issues with equity you know justice student achievement and and students

04:08:52.680 --> 04:08:58.600
are overrepresented in certain areas either with african-american hispanic special education

04:08:59.560 --> 04:09:04.440
which is a more restrictive environment so those those things are really really important

04:09:05.480 --> 04:09:12.120
also usually there is a district person that oversees of the the alternative school and they

04:09:12.120 --> 04:09:19.240
don't understand necessarily what what happens in those schools and i think it's really important

04:09:19.240 --> 04:09:24.120
if those schools are given assistance because they're they're in the bottom in the bottom rung

04:09:24.680 --> 04:09:30.760
that i think the uh i believe that the district person who oversees it needs to be a part of that

04:09:31.320 --> 04:09:37.320
of that assistance so that they understand what is necessary for the school to be uh to be

04:09:37.320 --> 04:09:44.280
successful and to and to do the right thing for their kids the for so long we've moved um our

04:09:44.280 --> 04:09:49.640
ineffective teachers more our most at-risk teachers to teach our most at-risk kids and that's

04:09:49.640 --> 04:09:56.760
quite simply malpractice we want our at-risk kids to be at promise kids and for that we need the

04:09:56.760 --> 04:10:04.840
people on on the uh in the schools to be able to do that and uh and those those folks are integral

04:10:04.840 --> 04:10:12.520
part in having the students move a transition uh transfer to the alternative school from the

04:10:12.520 --> 04:10:19.640
traditional school when necessary and to have all partners parents district office sending school

04:10:19.640 --> 04:10:26.920
receiving school all on the same page following best practice to do to do this work so that's

04:10:26.920 --> 04:10:33.400
that's what i wanted to share uh from my from my end and i would like to introduce diana walsh

04:10:33.400 --> 04:10:38.200
royce from uh riverside county office of ed the retired associate superintendent

04:10:38.760 --> 04:10:44.520
good afternoon president darling hammon superintendent thurman and esteemed members of the board and

04:10:44.520 --> 04:10:50.200
and colleagues and guests it's an honor to be here with you today i hope that you're doing well

04:10:50.200 --> 04:10:57.720
during these unprecedented uncertain times in my role at at the county office of education

04:10:57.720 --> 04:11:03.800
i serve students in the juvenile court and community schools a re-engagement charter adult

04:11:04.760 --> 04:11:12.120
jail programs special and in migrant education i also served as the past chair for the student

04:11:12.120 --> 04:11:18.840
programs and services steering committee under the umbrella of the county office superintendent's

04:11:18.840 --> 04:11:24.920
organization currently i serve as a was commissioner and continue to work with schools and districts

04:11:25.720 --> 04:11:31.880
um as i said it's an honor to be with you today and even more of an honor to be a part of the

04:11:31.880 --> 04:11:39.560
development of the das alternative accountability model in 2017 a group came to you about the need

04:11:39.560 --> 04:11:47.240
for relevant transparent accountability system with measures that are appropriate for students

04:11:47.240 --> 04:11:53.400
in alternative settings you've listened and you approved and that this work has moved forward

04:11:53.400 --> 04:12:00.680
so thank you so much for for that das has allowed alternative programs to enter the realm of

04:12:00.680 --> 04:12:07.080
accountability using metrics that are more applicable to the students we serve the importance

04:12:07.080 --> 04:12:16.600
of this can't be overstated in the past models lacked rigor and appropriateness alternative schools

04:12:16.600 --> 04:12:24.600
can now visibly demonstrate their significant role to the to the value added in our school community

04:12:25.560 --> 04:12:31.880
as a result i believe that many alternative schools are undergoing a transformation through

04:12:31.880 --> 04:12:39.080
improved instructional practices rigorous relevant curriculum individualized student-centered

04:12:39.080 --> 04:12:47.080
practices using research based holistic approaches and this dedication has led to thousands of

04:12:47.080 --> 04:12:51.000
students graduating from high school and realizing their dream for a better life

04:12:51.960 --> 04:12:59.640
das provides meaningful data to drive student learning growth and achievement and it emphasizes

04:13:00.440 --> 04:13:07.240
the importance of sharing this information with key stakeholders data on steroids as one of my

04:13:07.240 --> 04:13:14.920
colleagues said is a very valuable commodity most importantly data can help identify root causes

04:13:15.000 --> 04:13:19.880
that create barriers for students and this can lead to early intervention

04:13:20.600 --> 04:13:26.280
and earlier intervention is absolutely essential there may be a day sometime in the future if we're

04:13:26.280 --> 04:13:31.320
able to use early warning systems and early intervention to catch kids early where we won't

04:13:31.320 --> 04:13:38.920
need as many alternative schools i think it's essential that we continue to support schools

04:13:38.920 --> 04:13:45.960
and districts in using all facets of data and cde does an excellent job of this with kelp had

04:13:45.960 --> 04:13:52.920
support in addition many county offices provide intensive support through networks trainings

04:13:52.920 --> 04:13:59.480
and systems of support led by geographic leads i was fortunate to be part of a county office

04:13:59.480 --> 04:14:05.400
where das accountability updates were provided with follow-through support networks implemented

04:14:06.040 --> 04:14:12.680
and target assistance provided in other words differentiating support to focus specifically

04:14:12.680 --> 04:14:21.800
on das schools in addition as cindy mentioned the selfa system improvement leads have also made

04:14:21.800 --> 04:14:28.600
great strides in data informed practices for programs serving students with disabilities

04:14:29.320 --> 04:14:36.680
das has also incentivized the use of high impact strategies to creatively and innovatively

04:14:37.720 --> 04:14:45.560
ensure that our students graduate from college and career ready and grow academically and socially

04:14:45.560 --> 04:14:51.000
keeping in mind that building positive relationships and trust with students is foundational

04:14:51.480 --> 04:14:59.240
foundational many alternative schools have worked to increase their rigor by adding a to g

04:14:59.240 --> 04:15:06.760
course offerings they have achieved wasp accreditation however we know that many of

04:15:06.760 --> 04:15:11.800
the students arrive to our schools with gaps in their education and are credit deficient

04:15:12.600 --> 04:15:19.160
there's a need to continually build capacity to address the academic and programmatic needs of

04:15:19.160 --> 04:15:24.680
our students it's really all about continuous improvement and there are many outstanding

04:15:24.680 --> 04:15:31.000
organizations that have been mentioned in networks that focus on best practices but many times these

04:15:31.000 --> 04:15:37.320
organizations work in isolation but student programs and services steering committee the

04:15:37.320 --> 04:15:45.880
accent ed options the gardener center and numerous non-profits have created a repository of best

04:15:45.880 --> 04:15:53.000
practices but there's a need to lift up these evidence-based practices with a designated

04:15:53.000 --> 04:16:00.520
lead for more coordination among all of these groups there are many outstanding practices

04:16:00.520 --> 04:16:05.960
that schools scattered throughout pockets of the state and cde recognizes some of these schools

04:16:05.960 --> 04:16:11.480
through model continuation schools but this recognition doesn't expand to other schools

04:16:11.480 --> 04:16:18.600
such as opportunity community or court schools i believe there might be value in recognizing

04:16:18.600 --> 04:16:25.160
these schools as well and and the final point that i would like to make is that many students

04:16:25.160 --> 04:16:31.640
in alternative settings are served by multiple agencies such as probation social services

04:16:31.640 --> 04:16:39.160
mental health the district attorney's office community colleges and and many more and alternative

04:16:39.160 --> 04:16:46.200
schools leverage these key partnerships to support students social emotional and academic growth

04:16:47.160 --> 04:16:53.960
but there's a need to foster a coherent integrated system of support among agencies

04:16:54.600 --> 04:17:01.800
breaking down silos for unprecedented collaboration getting in the way of this collaboration

04:17:01.800 --> 04:17:09.080
our policies lack of data sharing separate funding streams and just the bureaucracy of

04:17:09.080 --> 04:17:15.160
large organizations we need to look to streamline services and work together with our sister

04:17:15.160 --> 04:17:21.240
and brother agencies for seamless services and then finally i want to take a moment to acknowledge

04:17:21.240 --> 04:17:27.720
california department of education cindy kazanis and jenny singh and their team and dr de la vasco

04:17:27.800 --> 04:17:31.960
and milbury mclaughlin from the gardener center at stanford for their vital leadership

04:17:32.840 --> 04:17:39.480
in creating a system that truly captures and reflects the strengths of our students i also

04:17:39.480 --> 04:17:45.080
want to give a shout out to the 22 members of the task force we worked with a true spirit of

04:17:45.080 --> 04:17:53.800
collaboration had many rich spirited discussions but passion always drove our work and lastly i

04:17:53.800 --> 04:17:59.800
want to take a moment to acknowledge and express gratitude for those educators who work directly

04:17:59.800 --> 04:18:06.760
with our students in alternative settings each and every day they do the heavy lifting we take

04:18:06.760 --> 04:18:12.040
great pride in our work with the most vulnerable students and believe that we continue to make

04:18:12.040 --> 04:18:18.680
great progress to help them achieve learn and thrive and i know there's so much going on in

04:18:18.680 --> 04:18:23.800
the world today with so many challenges and urgent needs but those challenges also have

04:18:23.800 --> 04:18:31.320
a silver lining to create better opportunities to serve our students so thank you so much again for

04:18:31.320 --> 04:18:42.760
the opportunity to speak today thank you so at this time i just wanted to touch base briefly on

04:18:42.920 --> 04:18:50.760
on next steps for this ongoing work this of course this this report is a culmination of

04:18:50.760 --> 04:18:57.320
four years of work but you have also been a part of this work as the state board in taking action

04:18:57.320 --> 04:19:03.480
on things that affect our alternative schools each year so we've been able to develop out

04:19:03.480 --> 04:19:09.320
not only the alternative school system the DAS system we've made corrections where we've needed

04:19:09.480 --> 04:19:15.400
so we've had continuous improvement in the system we will bring back to you in march as we do every

04:19:15.400 --> 04:19:21.880
march our work plan for the year and we will make every effort to include part of the recommendations

04:19:21.880 --> 04:19:27.160
of this task force where appropriate in that work plan so with that i wanted to open up for

04:19:27.160 --> 04:19:32.120
any clarifying questions at this time and i'll turn it back over to president darlene hammon for that

04:19:32.120 --> 04:19:38.840
yeah all right i'm gonna start off by just thanking this team and Jorge i remember when

04:19:38.840 --> 04:19:45.960
you started this work so many years ago it's wonderful to see it shaping state policy as

04:19:45.960 --> 04:19:51.160
well as practice in these directions really really really appreciate you and your colleagues

04:19:51.960 --> 04:19:59.320
giving us this very both hopeful and useful for our future thinking

04:19:59.960 --> 04:20:04.760
um type of briefing are there any other clarifying questions for this team before

04:20:04.760 --> 04:20:14.840
we go on to the next item all right so uh please proceed thank you so with that i'm going to turn

04:20:14.840 --> 04:20:20.360
it over to my colleague jenny sing who you see often associated with the growth model and she's

04:20:20.360 --> 04:20:24.520
going to walk you through the two part recommendation that we have for you today

04:20:29.320 --> 04:20:35.320
good afternoon everyone so i am in charge of um giving you the information that we've prepared

04:20:35.320 --> 04:20:40.120
in attachment one the analysis and recommendations for the parameters of our growth model

04:20:42.440 --> 04:20:45.560
so this is coming in we have two pieces in here so the first piece

04:20:46.200 --> 04:20:52.360
we're going to talk about is how to use the use of same subject test scores in the empirical best

04:20:52.360 --> 04:20:59.480
linear prediction model or e blip and um we're coming back to you um regarding this because

04:20:59.480 --> 04:21:06.120
we've decided to do a slight shift in our business rules for the e blip model and we want to make

04:21:06.120 --> 04:21:12.200
sure that the board is comfortable with that shift and because when we come back in march for an

04:21:12.200 --> 04:21:20.440
approval we don't want people to be surprised no surprises i'm done with surprises so remember

04:21:20.440 --> 04:21:26.440
that the e blip methodology actually takes the data from the residual gain scores and rolls it

04:21:26.440 --> 04:21:32.440
up and aggregates it up and i just wanted to remind everyone that in february we will be

04:21:32.440 --> 04:21:39.240
doing a memo and the memo will have a full report of everything we've done regarding the new growth

04:21:39.240 --> 04:21:45.160
model and it will have all the data in there for all the student groups all race the ethnicity

04:21:45.160 --> 04:21:51.080
groups and all program groups so that's el's homeless students with disabilities and foster youth

04:21:56.200 --> 04:22:02.840
so at the september board meeting ets and cde staff presented an update on the student level

04:22:02.840 --> 04:22:09.880
growth model and we shared information about the e blip again the e blip is just a methodology for

04:22:09.880 --> 04:22:16.440
aggregating up the scores the rg scores and in that we indicated that we were using multiple

04:22:16.440 --> 04:22:21.560
years of aggregate growth information this was going to improve the accuracy and stability

04:22:21.560 --> 04:22:26.600
of district school and student group growth scores and of course it did a much better

04:22:26.600 --> 04:22:30.920
job at improving the accuracy and stability for smaller end sizes

04:22:31.160 --> 04:22:34.360
so

04:22:37.640 --> 04:22:44.920
we also indicated that we were using multiple subjects for each of the growth scores so for

04:22:44.920 --> 04:22:50.440
the ela district school and student group growth scores we would use a weighted average

04:22:51.320 --> 04:22:58.040
from both prior english language arts ela and mathematics assessments of course most of the

04:22:58.040 --> 04:23:05.240
weight going to ela but some going to mathematics as well that's true for the mathematics so for

04:23:05.240 --> 04:23:10.760
us for the math growth scores district school and student group we would use a weighted average

04:23:10.760 --> 04:23:17.320
with scores from both prior english language arts and math and here of course the greater weight

04:23:17.320 --> 04:23:26.040
would go towards mathematics so during the presentation nobody raised any questions or

04:23:26.040 --> 04:23:33.560
asked any questions about this but after the meeting there were some concerns that were raised

04:23:33.560 --> 04:23:39.000
about the challenges of communicating the e blip scores to schools and districts using multiple

04:23:39.000 --> 04:23:46.760
subjects in the calculation so we had a couple of conversations with ets staff and we thought

04:23:46.760 --> 04:23:53.000
that that was a really valid point and we thought well we should make the shift to use the single

04:23:53.000 --> 04:23:58.520
subject only and one of the reasons we can do this of course is because with the residual gain

04:23:58.520 --> 04:24:06.360
model the calculations at the student level already include prior year scores in both ela and math

04:24:07.640 --> 04:24:14.920
now that decision was made based on the data from ets and a recommendation by the tdg in 2017

04:24:16.200 --> 04:24:22.680
and just to be sure we went back to the tdg had a conversation and they said yes we want to keep

04:24:22.680 --> 04:24:29.240
both subjects for the residual gain score in order to improve the validity of the score

04:24:29.960 --> 04:24:36.600
the accuracy of it and then of course in may of 2018 the board approved this methodology

04:24:40.920 --> 04:24:47.640
so restricting the e blip aggregate scores to only include prior year data from the same subject

04:24:47.640 --> 04:24:53.560
will help with communication to the field it does not significantly change the gross score results

04:24:54.280 --> 04:25:00.600
and it will not affect the current timeline that we have of delivering this product by april of 2021

04:25:04.600 --> 04:25:10.920
okay on to recommendation number two to maintain the current student level methodology

04:25:11.640 --> 04:25:15.800
and not to incorporate student characteristics in our growth model

04:25:18.280 --> 04:25:25.720
so i'm going to start by going back to 2017 where i know we have some members of the board who

04:25:25.720 --> 04:25:31.800
weren't there at the time but in 2017 the board discussed the criteria that we should use in the

04:25:31.800 --> 04:25:37.720
selection of a student growth model and based on that discussion it was clear that they did not

04:25:37.720 --> 04:25:44.360
want to include student characteristics such as race social economic status or language status

04:25:44.760 --> 04:25:48.600
or language status into the calculation formula for growth model

04:25:52.680 --> 04:25:58.040
and so why did that why was that decision made because when you do include characteristics

04:25:58.040 --> 04:26:03.960
demographics or other variables it does change growth expectations and results

04:26:05.400 --> 04:26:12.360
for each student because it's impacting the residual gain score it eliminates the ability

04:26:12.360 --> 04:26:17.960
to compare results across student groups so you would no longer be able to compare

04:26:18.680 --> 04:26:23.400
the results from students with disabilities to foster or homeless

04:26:25.720 --> 04:26:31.320
and it eliminates any measurement of the achievement gap so we don't know if the

04:26:31.320 --> 04:26:37.320
achievement gap is getting wider or if it's closing and that was a very important point for the board

04:26:37.880 --> 04:26:46.360
so we shared this we had quite a few conversations with the stakeholder group the growth model

04:26:46.360 --> 04:26:53.160
stakeholder group and one of the conversations was about demographics and so we did talk a lot about

04:26:54.360 --> 04:26:59.720
growth models and what questions that they can answer so when you're looking at growth

04:27:00.200 --> 04:27:06.120
really what you want to do is to look at how much did students learn over the last school year

04:27:07.640 --> 04:27:12.280
that is one of the big purposes that we wanted to reach and that the stakeholder groups wanted

04:27:13.080 --> 04:27:18.280
and so in order to do that you can't include demographics

04:27:22.200 --> 04:27:26.280
because that doesn't determine that doesn't tell you how much growth they want to do

04:27:26.280 --> 04:27:30.920
because that doesn't determine that doesn't tell you how much growth they've had you've adjusted the

04:27:30.920 --> 04:27:41.800
scores and we did talk about putting in demographics but the question that that answers

04:27:42.680 --> 04:27:51.080
is how much did students learn over the last year compared to other students with similar personal

04:27:51.080 --> 04:27:52.920
family and community backgrounds

04:27:55.560 --> 04:27:57.560
so that answers a very different question

04:28:03.400 --> 04:28:10.680
so at the september 2020 meeting we received a letter that included a report from dr pete goldsmith

04:28:12.440 --> 04:28:18.040
and the report outlined a suggestion to include the english language proficiency assessment

04:28:18.040 --> 04:28:24.120
for california lpac achievement levels in the student growth calculation for english learners

04:28:28.520 --> 04:28:31.880
and at the meeting we were asked to investigate

04:28:32.600 --> 04:28:34.760
whether this is something that we would want to consider

04:28:37.560 --> 04:28:46.360
so cde convened a meeting with dr goldsmith along with sb staff ets staff and two members of the

04:28:46.360 --> 04:28:52.200
tdg we had some technical questions we wanted to make sure we had the right people at the meeting

04:28:52.840 --> 04:28:58.040
dr goldsmith was very kind gave us an hour of his time we had a really great conversation

04:28:59.400 --> 04:29:06.440
and we did come to the conclusion of consensus that is adding lpac levels would not allow

04:29:06.440 --> 04:29:12.440
for meaningful comparison between eels and all other student groups and that's really important

04:29:12.440 --> 04:29:17.080
because if we're going to put the growth model into the dashboard when people come to the dashboard

04:29:17.960 --> 04:29:24.600
they come thinking that they're they can compare student groups and they would not be able to

04:29:24.600 --> 04:29:30.600
determine that they couldn't compare them on the academic indicator because they would not know

04:29:30.600 --> 04:29:32.680
that those results reflected different metrics

04:29:37.080 --> 04:29:40.280
we also reached out to californians together we had a meeting with them

04:29:40.920 --> 04:29:47.640
to talk about the conversation we had with dr goldsmith and they understood why we didn't

04:29:47.640 --> 04:29:54.920
want to go down this road and dr goldsmith did say it was not his intent to slow down the progress

04:29:54.920 --> 04:30:01.720
of the growth model but he just wanted to bring our attention to the fact that the lpac scores

04:30:02.360 --> 04:30:06.360
shown along with smarter balance scores was really an important thing

04:30:06.840 --> 04:30:15.160
so we thought that that was probably a really good idea and it could be useful to schools and

04:30:15.160 --> 04:30:22.360
districts so we did commit to coming up with some kind of report where you could see the results

04:30:23.560 --> 04:30:31.400
of the cast scores by english language by the lpac levels i wanted to be very transparent

04:30:31.880 --> 04:30:38.680
transparent i did say that that's work we cannot do right now we're really busy with the growth

04:30:38.680 --> 04:30:44.840
model but that that would be one of the next big things that we took on and dr goldsmith

04:30:44.840 --> 04:30:49.400
seemed to be okay with that and and it seemed like when we had our conversations with

04:30:49.960 --> 04:30:53.240
members of california together they were supportive of that as well

04:30:55.960 --> 04:30:59.160
so with that i will take any clarifying questions

04:31:01.720 --> 04:31:09.400
thank you very much jenny are there clarifying questions and thanks by the way for following

04:31:09.400 --> 04:31:14.920
up and you know finding out more about that proposal and really digging in on it both

04:31:15.640 --> 04:31:21.480
intellectually and with the stakeholder groups and with dr goldsmith himself so much appreciated

04:31:21.480 --> 04:31:28.600
i think you gave a clear rendering of the issues patricia do you want to ask a clarifying question

04:31:28.600 --> 04:31:36.520
and then i think i saw one other hand go up matt first of all i also want to thank you and the staff

04:31:36.520 --> 04:31:43.400
for the tremendous amount of work that it took to follow up on this request i was the board member

04:31:43.400 --> 04:31:48.360
who made the request to look at the report and the recommendation or suggestion that came from

04:31:48.360 --> 04:31:55.000
dr goldsmith so i truly do appreciate the investigation and the research that was done

04:31:55.000 --> 04:32:01.080
i'm looking here at the slide that you have concerning looking at options for breaking down

04:32:01.080 --> 04:32:06.440
the data when you use that term of art breaking down the data you're talking about

04:32:06.440 --> 04:32:13.960
disaggregating the information in particular ways as well as giving a larger group kind of report

04:32:13.960 --> 04:32:19.480
or is that or are you looking at doing something different well there's multiple options that we

04:32:19.480 --> 04:32:26.600
have for displaying lpac levels with calf scores so we're looking at that and there was also a

04:32:26.600 --> 04:32:32.520
request to do a breakout of english learners versus rfp students so we're looking at that as well

04:32:33.160 --> 04:32:38.520
so those okay okay uh again i certainly appreciate that and i appreciate that

04:32:44.120 --> 04:32:45.640
pat we've lost your sound

04:32:49.480 --> 04:32:57.160
oh well we hope you got it in what you uh wanted to say

04:33:00.120 --> 04:33:03.320
uh i don't see any other hands up for clarifying questions

04:33:05.320 --> 04:33:12.280
so um cindy is that the last part of the item i just wanted to add that you know when we're

04:33:12.280 --> 04:33:18.520
going to report out the data the lpac data levels with the cast and break them out by ela and

04:33:18.520 --> 04:33:23.880
rfp that's consistent with how we're reporting the academic indicator on the dashboard we do

04:33:23.880 --> 04:33:31.640
break that information out so that people have access to it if they want it okay so is this the

04:33:31.640 --> 04:33:36.920
point then at which we want to get the public comment slide up cindy yes so just to to close

04:33:36.920 --> 04:33:42.120
out this item i just wanted to let you know that in the midst of the pandemic and working remotely

04:33:42.120 --> 04:33:47.560
we continue to provide technical assistance to the field and stakeholder sessions and so

04:33:47.560 --> 04:33:54.600
just wanted to highlight that information in this last slide and i will just briefly show you the

04:33:54.600 --> 04:34:02.520
board action before you before moving over to the public comment slide that was very brief

04:34:03.160 --> 04:34:10.280
but we all have it in our documents thank you at this point i want to encourage people to call in

04:34:10.280 --> 04:34:16.520
for public comment by calling the number on that slide and entering the access code and while we're

04:34:16.520 --> 04:34:21.240
waiting for members of the public to call in i want to first ask member burr and then vice

04:34:21.240 --> 04:34:29.880
president spouse if they have any initial comments for us now i would just say i also

04:34:29.880 --> 04:34:37.000
expressed my appreciation to to cindy and jenny and the whole team for following up both on the

04:34:37.000 --> 04:34:43.240
residual gain model because questions were raised about it as as jenny explained and also on the

04:34:43.240 --> 04:34:51.080
concerns that were raised about whether or not to include lpec in the model so after public comment

04:34:51.080 --> 04:34:58.120
i'd be happy to make a motion on the department's recommendation terrific thank you and vice president

04:34:58.120 --> 04:35:03.400
strauss i just wanted to say that i just so appreciate the department working so hard

04:35:03.400 --> 04:35:08.680
on the growth measure to continue to move us forward to get it right for us and to address

04:35:08.760 --> 04:35:15.880
all the issues i do appreciate the clarification that cindy that jenny singh said about the

04:35:15.880 --> 04:35:20.760
disaggregated data that will be available on all the different subgroups and to remind

04:35:20.760 --> 04:35:26.040
our stakeholders and those watching that there will be ability to take a look at how the different

04:35:26.040 --> 04:35:33.080
groups are doing and finally i just want to make a comment about the the das report and just so

04:35:33.080 --> 04:35:40.280
appreciate the comments but i'm very um i i agree with what um of lascaux talked about

04:35:41.800 --> 04:35:48.920
the giving us actionable data for students in alternative schools and also what um diana walsh

04:35:48.920 --> 04:35:55.400
talked about about looking at options with the career indicator so that alternative schools

04:35:55.400 --> 04:36:01.720
continue to provide workforce pathway options access to a to g so that students leave the

04:36:01.720 --> 04:36:07.080
alternative setting with pure options successful options for post-secondary achievement so i i

04:36:07.080 --> 04:36:11.640
really feel like the work is really i'm going to strengthen our work because when you have those

04:36:11.640 --> 04:36:16.200
on the college and career indicator it does help districts focus and schools focus on offering

04:36:16.200 --> 04:36:21.880
those opportunities yeah thank you that's a really good point and patricia i see that your

04:36:21.880 --> 04:36:27.800
hand is up did you want to try again to ask your clarifying question or finish it

04:36:32.680 --> 04:36:41.640
oh we're not hearing you i'm so sorry oh we thought we had solved your technology problems this week

04:36:42.600 --> 04:36:48.440
something's going on okay i hope you can fix it can she type it in the chat box and then we can

04:36:48.440 --> 04:36:55.640
take it in the chat it will come back around to it all right with that being said i think we are

04:36:55.720 --> 04:37:02.520
ready then to go to public comment and are there any are there any public commenters

04:37:03.880 --> 04:37:09.960
yes there are good afternoon caller please state your name and affiliation for the record your

04:37:09.960 --> 04:37:21.720
time begins now good afternoon this is martin and this i am the executive director of california

04:37:21.720 --> 04:37:26.920
together and former county and district administrator i first want to thank the

04:37:26.920 --> 04:37:32.440
department for exploring the additional option of breaking down the data reports among the el

04:37:32.440 --> 04:37:39.320
student group with respect to their alpac level in march in the march meeting of the state board

04:37:39.320 --> 04:37:45.640
of education the california department of education presented a data run as an example

04:37:45.640 --> 04:37:51.320
of the application of the proposed growth model for students with disabilities and homeless youth

04:37:51.400 --> 04:37:57.080
the board requested data runs for the other students subgroups and so we continue to request

04:37:57.080 --> 04:38:04.360
those data runs for all student groups including english learners with the l plus rfs and also of

04:38:04.360 --> 04:38:10.040
course disaggregating the two core hosts before any final decisions are made on the growth model

04:38:10.040 --> 04:38:15.720
design having this information is important to be able to see how best to use the new academic

04:38:15.720 --> 04:38:21.720
indicator for identifying needs program instructional planning and al cap development

04:38:21.720 --> 04:38:22.760
thank you very much

04:38:33.800 --> 04:38:38.280
good afternoon caller please state your name and affiliation for the record your time begins now

04:38:38.280 --> 04:38:38.840
now

04:38:43.960 --> 04:38:47.640
good morning president darling hamman superintendent thurman and members of the board

04:38:47.640 --> 04:38:52.680
my name is ruth borahus and i'm with californians together while it is great to hear today that the

04:38:52.680 --> 04:38:59.160
cde will be looking at disaggregating the two cohorts of el's and our febs you know we believe

04:38:59.160 --> 04:39:04.280
this information is gained you know will will that that we gain from this will warrant this effort

04:39:04.280 --> 04:39:08.680
and we hope to see this before march having served as a school principal and an el specialist

04:39:08.680 --> 04:39:14.760
at both title one schools and large populations with large populations of the el's and and also

04:39:14.760 --> 04:39:20.760
schools of smaller populations um the where the growth target was very important and we need to

04:39:20.760 --> 04:39:25.960
be addressed i can tell you after spending countless hours looking at data to drill down

04:39:25.960 --> 04:39:30.680
to see how our el's were progressing or not we could have benefited greatly from this state

04:39:30.680 --> 04:39:34.360
accountability system based on this growth model with special attention to these groups

04:39:35.000 --> 04:39:39.560
if there and and if there is an absolute agreement that we cannot increase these

04:39:39.560 --> 04:39:43.240
numbers of subgroups then we propose that the definition of the english runner subgroup

04:39:43.240 --> 04:39:49.080
include the current el's and only the arklips who be classified in the second year after the data

04:39:49.080 --> 04:39:49.560
thank you

04:39:49.720 --> 04:39:50.200
okay

04:39:56.120 --> 04:40:01.080
good afternoon caller please state your name and affiliation for the record your time begins now

04:40:09.960 --> 04:40:14.680
good afternoon president darlin hamid superintendent thurman and members of the board

04:40:14.680 --> 04:40:18.280
my name is crystal vias i was a former preschool teacher and i am here with

04:40:18.280 --> 04:40:24.280
californians together initially the sbe and cde were concerned about the volatility of the data

04:40:24.280 --> 04:40:29.560
comparing grade level to grade level that would include newcomers and rfps entering and exiting

04:40:29.560 --> 04:40:36.280
yearly respectively resulting in an unstable group for analysis however with the growth model used

04:40:36.280 --> 04:40:42.280
matching scores the group would be more stable and with less volatility we would suggest that el to

04:40:42.280 --> 04:40:47.400
reclassify within the first year of data collection be included in the rfp group and those who

04:40:47.400 --> 04:40:51.800
reclassify in the second or subsequent year to be included in the el subgroup thank you

04:40:58.600 --> 04:41:03.400
good afternoon caller please state your name and affiliation for the record your time begins now

04:41:10.440 --> 04:41:15.480
good afternoon president darlin hamid superintendent thurmond and members of the board

04:41:15.560 --> 04:41:21.240
my name is ashley aguirre i am a former english learner student and i am here today with californians

04:41:21.240 --> 04:41:26.840
together i'd like to add that using the same formula aggregating one year el data and four

04:41:26.840 --> 04:41:32.600
year rf rf data and continuing to use the same methodology to determine performance levels

04:41:33.160 --> 04:41:38.760
when there are clearly unintended negative consequences may be equal but it is not equitable

04:41:38.760 --> 04:41:43.720
and is counter to the spirit of continuous improvement english learners who come to our

04:41:43.720 --> 04:41:49.480
schools speaking a language other than english require a system of accountability that includes

04:41:49.480 --> 04:41:55.880
an adjusted formula and methodology that uplifts their successes and highlights their needs

04:41:55.880 --> 04:41:59.560
within the framework of the state accountability system thank you

04:42:04.840 --> 04:42:09.560
good afternoon caller please state your name and affiliation for the record your time starts now

04:42:13.880 --> 04:42:17.480
hello it's eric premack with the charter schools development center good afternoon

04:42:18.200 --> 04:42:25.240
president madam president and members i support the recommendation from staff with respect to

04:42:25.240 --> 04:42:32.040
the e blip and how to handle that i would note however that with respect to the larger issue of

04:42:32.040 --> 04:42:37.160
demographic adjustments i don't think the state should limit itself to a single model i support

04:42:37.160 --> 04:42:43.320
single model i support the notion of the model that we're currently pursuing but i think that

04:42:43.320 --> 04:42:48.760
we could also have a second growth metric that is demographically adjusted that would be

04:42:49.400 --> 04:42:56.280
informative and in many cases more useful for high stakes decision making purposes and would

04:42:56.280 --> 04:43:03.400
encourage you to pursue both thank you

04:43:09.720 --> 04:43:17.400
good afternoon caller please state your name and affiliation for the record your time starts now

04:43:26.840 --> 04:43:32.520
good afternoon this is jessica saco with children now i want to thank the board for our thanks

04:43:32.520 --> 04:43:37.800
uh the team for bringing this item forward today um as we have mentioned previously we strongly

04:43:37.800 --> 04:43:44.200
encourage the board to take up in january which would be in January and we would like to thank

04:43:44.200 --> 04:43:50.120
the board for providing us with the information that we would like to share with you about the

04:43:50.680 --> 04:43:56.840
previously we strongly encourage the board to take up in January which would be the last

04:43:56.840 --> 04:44:03.320
opportunity to do so before the march meeting where we're projecting a decision to be made

04:44:03.320 --> 04:44:10.040
regarding the growth model particularly we'd like the board to discuss the use of and release of

04:44:10.040 --> 04:44:16.920
individual student growth scores as well as a provide input on a robust communication plan

04:44:16.920 --> 04:44:22.280
which would be critical to the successful implementation of and release of the data with

04:44:22.280 --> 04:44:29.480
the growth model finally in regards to the alternative ed schools we find it to be a very

04:44:29.480 --> 04:44:38.840
interesting idea to measure chronic absence which ranges at about 50 percent and it's likely the

04:44:38.840 --> 04:44:45.400
most important measure and provide the most substantive information relative to the performance

04:44:45.400 --> 04:44:47.320
of alternative school thank you

04:44:51.640 --> 04:44:56.280
good afternoon caller please state your name and affiliation for the record your time starts now

04:45:01.720 --> 04:45:07.320
good afternoon board members this is Manuel Bonrostro with Californians Together and I am

04:45:07.320 --> 04:45:14.120
calling to voice uh support for for the for the for the state to conduct data runs on aggregated

04:45:14.120 --> 04:45:19.640
scores of English learners and RFEPs and separately for ELs and RFEPs with color

04:45:19.640 --> 04:45:24.760
performance levels at this point in time we are not requesting any changes to the definition

04:45:25.400 --> 04:45:29.720
but ask that these runs be conducted so that we can better understand the impact for program

04:45:29.720 --> 04:45:36.280
planning LCAP development and accountability it is our hope as well that these runs and analysis be

04:45:36.280 --> 04:45:43.400
reported before the board meeting in in March with additional luxury that COVID-19 has afforded the

04:45:43.400 --> 04:45:48.200
state it is critical that we use this opportunity to determine the best approach for redesigning

04:45:48.200 --> 04:45:53.560
the academic indicator for growth for the growth model and rethink what equity not equality would

04:45:53.560 --> 04:46:02.280
look like for English learners thank you good afternoon caller please state your name and

04:46:02.280 --> 04:46:04.840
affiliation for the record your time starts now

04:46:05.000 --> 04:46:10.840
Good afternoon Dr. Darling-Hammond, Superintendent Thurman, and State Board of Education members.

04:46:10.840 --> 04:46:14.440
My name is Lorraine Richards. I am a classroom teacher representing the California Teacher

04:46:14.440 --> 04:46:20.440
Association. California Teacher Association appreciates the CDE's continued work on developing

04:46:20.440 --> 04:46:25.800
a growth model for the state of California. While CTA has expressed many questions and concerns

04:46:25.800 --> 04:46:30.680
on the growth model in past letters, we are supportive of the CDE's continued work on developing

04:46:30.920 --> 04:46:35.320
questions and concerns on the growth model in past letters. We are supportive of the two main

04:46:35.320 --> 04:46:40.600
recommendations. The CDE's recommendation to only use the same subject area when modeling student

04:46:40.600 --> 04:46:46.040
growth is a sound and an appropriate approach. Additionally, the recommendation to not set

04:46:46.040 --> 04:46:51.640
different bars for students based on their demographics is in alignment with CTA's stance

04:46:51.640 --> 04:46:56.120
on equity. Although it would be appropriate to conduct data simulations and to share those

04:46:56.120 --> 04:47:01.240
simulations with the growth model stakeholder group and stakeholders prior to any final

04:47:01.240 --> 04:47:05.800
determination made by the State Board of Education. We look forward to having additional discussions

04:47:05.800 --> 04:47:09.720
on the issue of a student growth model as part of the accountability system for schools and

04:47:09.720 --> 04:47:13.720
districts to ensure that is not used for teacher evaluation purposes. Thank you.

04:47:18.760 --> 04:47:23.560
Good afternoon caller please state your name and affiliation for the record your time starts now.

04:47:26.120 --> 04:47:34.120
Good afternoon Martha Zaragoza Diaz representing the California Association for Bilingual

04:47:34.120 --> 04:47:41.480
Education and Californians Together. We appreciate CDE staff taking the steps of further breaking

04:47:41.480 --> 04:47:49.320
down data especially regarding the disaggregation of the EL and RFIP data separately. Districts

04:47:49.320 --> 04:47:55.480
require accurate and transparent data for the identification and development of appropriate

04:47:55.480 --> 04:48:00.920
and effective goals actions and services for these students in their LCAP. This is

04:48:00.920 --> 04:48:06.920
essentially critical for EL's and RFIP's not progressing academically. However, we request

04:48:06.920 --> 04:48:12.520
that this data be presented to the State Board members before its March meeting when they will

04:48:12.520 --> 04:48:20.600
be approving the growth model. Thank you. Good afternoon caller please state your name and

04:48:20.600 --> 04:48:23.160
affiliation for the record your time starts now.

04:48:26.360 --> 04:48:34.520
Good afternoon Board members and President Darling-Hammond. This is Liz Guian with Public

04:48:34.520 --> 04:48:40.440
Advocates. I'm speaking to the letter we submitted on behalf of the Equity Coalition.

04:48:41.160 --> 04:48:45.560
We don't have a position on the technical changes that the department is proposing today on the

04:48:45.560 --> 04:48:50.840
student growth model but we are still concerned with the issues that we raised at the July and

04:48:50.840 --> 04:48:56.600
September meetings and we urge you to direct the department to address these concerns in their

04:48:56.600 --> 04:49:04.040
work plan between now and January so that they can address them prior to the first data release

04:49:04.040 --> 04:49:11.240
in March. This is about releasing historic individual student data in December developing

04:49:11.240 --> 04:49:17.480
the communication strategy which we know will be very important disaggregating English learners

04:49:17.480 --> 04:49:26.920
subgroup data. Also we appreciate the report and recommendations from the Gardiner Center

04:49:27.640 --> 04:49:37.640
and believe that those additional metrics should be explored and we also suggest that the chronic

04:49:37.640 --> 04:49:42.200
absence indicate one that is used. Thank you.

04:49:47.160 --> 04:49:51.720
Good afternoon caller please state your name and affiliation for the record your time begins now.

04:50:02.600 --> 04:50:03.480
Are you there caller?

04:50:07.640 --> 04:50:13.320
This concludes public comment.

04:50:20.760 --> 04:50:24.360
Let me get off mute. Thank you to all the public commenters

04:50:26.360 --> 04:50:37.240
and at this point we are open to further board discussion. Please raise your hand in the chat

04:50:38.440 --> 04:50:43.400
I mean in the participant list if you want to make a comment. I know that

04:50:43.400 --> 04:50:49.160
we were having some technical difficulties with Kim's technology. We'll wait in here

04:50:50.280 --> 04:50:54.680
Brooks is checking. Patricia your hand is up.

04:50:57.080 --> 04:51:04.760
Was that a question and then I have Matt after that. Thank you President Hammond. I just wanted

04:51:04.760 --> 04:51:13.480
to verify that we I think my problem has been fixed. My question with Jenny was just a follow

04:51:13.480 --> 04:51:20.920
up in response to her answer about the flexibility to do some data analysis in particular ways

04:51:20.920 --> 04:51:26.840
about the ELs and she heard some questions or suggestions during the public comment that came

04:51:26.840 --> 04:51:32.200
from a number of stakeholders. So we have time between now and the January board meeting to look

04:51:32.200 --> 04:51:38.280
into that so I don't need to go into that again but thank you very much. All right and Matt did

04:51:38.280 --> 04:51:43.880
you have a question? Your hand went up and then it disappeared. Yeah no I figured I'll forget to take

04:51:43.880 --> 04:51:50.520
it down so once you see it. No I have two clarifying questions. I a couple of callers

04:51:51.800 --> 04:52:00.040
that mentioned the chronic attendance indicator chronic absence indicator being part considered in

04:52:00.600 --> 04:52:05.480
the recommendations for alternative schools and I was wondering if Jorge was still on the line and

04:52:05.480 --> 04:52:11.960
and if they're considering that and the second one is it seems to me that we continue to hear

04:52:11.960 --> 04:52:18.520
this idea around ELs and RFPs being separated but if I understood correctly and based on what I know

04:52:18.520 --> 04:52:25.160
districts can do that. Is that correct Cindy? Yes so to answer your first question unfortunately

04:52:25.160 --> 04:52:30.840
Jorge did sign off a little early. I don't think I asked him to stay around actually so

04:52:30.840 --> 04:52:38.040
I apologize. No worries. For the data runs and I just wanted to clarify this for everyone

04:52:38.040 --> 04:52:43.400
we will be providing you an information memorandum in February for all the student groups that

04:52:43.400 --> 04:52:48.120
appear on the dashboard as well as the further disaggregation as you see it for the academic

04:52:48.120 --> 04:52:52.760
indicator for the English learner student group. So you will see all that information ahead of

04:52:52.760 --> 04:52:59.960
your meeting in March so that you will you know have enough time to to work through that

04:53:00.600 --> 04:53:05.000
but that is our anticipated that's the work plan that we have with

04:53:05.000 --> 04:53:13.400
educational testing services to to deliver that. Great thank you. Kim is on the phone she's having

04:53:13.400 --> 04:53:16.920
some video tech problems but Kim are you there? Do you want to ask her?

04:53:16.920 --> 04:53:23.320
I'm not hearing you.

04:53:26.120 --> 04:53:29.800
I think that was just answered right now so we're all set thank you.

04:53:31.800 --> 04:53:36.920
Okay great terrific and glad you're at least able to be on the phone.

04:53:38.600 --> 04:53:41.720
Are there any other questions or comments from the board

04:53:42.360 --> 04:53:44.840
before we look for a motion on this item?

04:53:48.040 --> 04:53:56.600
Seeing none can I have a motion? Yes I would recommend that the board adopt the department's

04:53:56.600 --> 04:54:04.280
recommendation per the powerpoint that's up on the screen that we confirm in the model the EBLIB

04:54:04.280 --> 04:54:10.120
I don't like that acronym but we'll only use the same subject area when modeling student growth

04:54:10.200 --> 04:54:13.960
and two that we will maintain the current student level methodology

04:54:14.520 --> 04:54:18.120
which holds the same expectations for growth for all student groups.

04:54:19.880 --> 04:54:25.320
Terrific I will second it thank you very much. Any further board discussion?

04:54:27.160 --> 04:54:32.920

waiver number seven which is not on consent uh and uh this is a waiver request by the 14

05:02:56.200 --> 05:03:01.560
the way of california education code sections governing the process for selling or leasing

05:03:01.560 --> 05:03:10.520
surplus property uh and the cde i will allow Juan Morelos from the cde to share the cd

05:03:10.520 --> 05:03:18.440
recommendation uh and present the item thank you good afternoon president darlin hammond

05:03:18.440 --> 05:03:23.560
chief deputy superintendent grexen board members my name is Juan Morelos i'm the director of the

05:03:23.560 --> 05:03:27.960
school facilities and transportation services division here at cde and i'm going to be presenting

05:03:27.960 --> 05:03:34.280
waiver seven today waiver seven is a request by the torrance unified school district to

05:03:34.280 --> 05:03:39.480
waive certain sections of the law that would require them to go through the sealed bid process

05:03:39.480 --> 05:03:46.040
and select the highest bidder instead the district plans on using the request for proposal process

05:03:46.040 --> 05:03:48.680
which will provide them greater flexibility in selecting

05:03:49.400 --> 05:03:54.360
beneficial terms and being able to consider other factors instead of just the highest price

05:03:58.360 --> 05:04:04.520
cde staff recommends approval of the request to waive the sealed bid and highest bid

05:04:05.160 --> 05:04:11.720
sections of the law with the following conditions that the proposal be selected within 30 to 60

05:04:11.720 --> 05:04:17.800
days of the public meeting where it was received and that the reasons for determination be discussed

05:04:17.800 --> 05:04:23.480
at a public session included in the minutes of the meeting another condition is that prior to

05:04:23.480 --> 05:04:28.600
entering negotiations the governing board shall hold a public hearing where members of the public

05:04:28.600 --> 05:04:34.440
including labor organizations can discuss possible uses of the surplus property and share concerns

05:04:34.440 --> 05:04:39.080
regarding the impact on the community including the potential relocation of the programs currently

05:04:39.080 --> 05:04:46.840
operating at the property and then lastly that this approval is just for the lease of the property

05:04:46.840 --> 05:04:51.400
should the district decide to sell the property then another waiver would be required

05:04:53.640 --> 05:04:56.600
so

05:04:56.600 --> 05:05:02.600
cd staff recognizes that one of the reasons for denial is if the bargaining units were not participants

05:05:02.600 --> 05:05:07.320
in the development of the waiver however cd staff believes that the bargaining units were

05:05:07.320 --> 05:05:12.200
participants in the development of the waiver given the correspondence and the discussion

05:05:12.200 --> 05:05:19.800
between the two parties over time now before we get into the specifics of the waiver request

05:05:19.800 --> 05:05:25.320
we wanted to provide you just a very high level overview of the surplus property process here in

05:05:25.320 --> 05:05:31.560
california which the districts have to go through at the local level before we get these types of

05:05:31.560 --> 05:05:38.520
waivers the first step is to identify a property in this case the property in question is known

05:05:38.520 --> 05:05:46.040
as a hamilton adult center then there's a public engagement process that's specified in law through

05:05:46.040 --> 05:05:51.960
what's called a 7-eleven committee now the 7-eleven is because it's a minimum of seven members

05:05:51.960 --> 05:05:58.760
and a maximum of 11 the law also specifies that the membership of the committee must be represented

05:05:58.760 --> 05:06:04.360
of the community by assigning specific representation from different ethnic age groups

05:06:04.360 --> 05:06:09.560
and socioeconomic composition of the district business community store owners managers supervisors

05:06:09.560 --> 05:06:15.880
teachers landowners administrators parents persons with expertise environmental impact

05:06:15.880 --> 05:06:22.600
legal contracts and building codes the committee is charged with looking at current and future

05:06:22.600 --> 05:06:28.040
facility needs enrollment and any other factors may impact the need to retain the property

05:06:29.400 --> 05:06:35.480
the committee is charged with holding public meetings and to establish a list prioritizing

05:06:35.480 --> 05:06:40.760
uses for any of the unused property and then finally to submit a report with recommendations

05:06:40.760 --> 05:06:45.480
to the governing board once the governing board receives the recommendation from the 7-eleven

05:06:45.480 --> 05:06:49.560
committee then at a regularly scheduled public meeting they can decide that they're going to

05:06:49.560 --> 05:06:55.000
accept the report and adopt the resolution to declare all or some of the properties surplus

05:06:57.960 --> 05:07:04.680
in this particular case the 7-eleven committee began holding public meetings in october of

05:07:04.680 --> 05:07:10.920
2017 they had a total of six public meetings through april 2018 the committee issued their

05:07:10.920 --> 05:07:17.720
final report on july 31st and the district's governing board declared the property surplus

05:07:17.720 --> 05:07:28.360
on august 6 2016 next we're going to walk you through some background and sequence of events

05:07:29.000 --> 05:07:32.840
starting with the original waiver that was submitted back in august 2019

05:07:34.200 --> 05:07:40.200
then in november of 2019 due to some conflicting information regarding one of the bargaining

05:07:40.200 --> 05:07:45.960
units positions the item was withdrawn by staff and moved to the january 2020 meeting

05:07:47.080 --> 05:07:52.760
in december 17th of 2019 the district met with the bargaining units to discuss the waiver

05:07:53.720 --> 05:08:00.600
and on december 30th 2019 the district requested to withdraw the waiver request from the january board meeting

05:08:04.120 --> 05:08:08.600
next march 2nd the district met with the bargaining unit representatives

05:08:08.600 --> 05:08:14.760
to further discuss the waiver on august 17th the district sent letters via email to all of

05:08:14.760 --> 05:08:20.680
the four bargaining units on their intent to refile the waiver request and to solicit feedback

05:08:20.680 --> 05:08:24.920
they also indicate that they had additional conversations with two of the bargaining units

05:08:24.920 --> 05:08:30.280
regarding the waiver and then finally on august 27th of this year the district submitted the

05:08:30.280 --> 05:08:38.840
current waiver request through our review we confirmed that three of the four bargaining units

05:08:39.400 --> 05:08:45.880
opposed the waiver the following reasons were for opposition were stated that the district has been

05:08:45.880 --> 05:08:51.640
less than transparent a refusal by the district to be inclusive in the process poor planning and

05:08:51.640 --> 05:08:57.800
execution of plans by the district mischaracterization of the position and lack of community support

05:08:57.800 --> 05:09:07.960
including the sports program we received a letter on october 28th from csea urging the board to

05:09:07.960 --> 05:09:13.720
deny the waiver request the main concerns raised in the letter were as follows that the educational

05:09:13.800 --> 05:09:19.480
needs of the pupils are not adequately addressed that the pupil or school personnel protections

05:09:19.480 --> 05:09:24.280
are jeopardized they also mentioned that planned staff reductions of 10 instructional aids

05:09:24.920 --> 05:09:29.480
and that the exclusive representatives of the employees were not a participant in the development

05:09:29.480 --> 05:09:37.720
of the waiver we received two letters from the school district one dated november 2nd

05:09:38.360 --> 05:09:43.720
which stated the following that the district recognized the importance of the hamilton adult

05:09:43.720 --> 05:09:47.800
center program and that they were fully committed in maintaining the programs in the district

05:09:48.680 --> 05:09:54.440
that the reductions in adult education funding and the inability to offset the laws were the

05:09:54.440 --> 05:09:59.160
reasons for staff reductions and that the reductions were unrelated to the waiver request

05:10:00.360 --> 05:10:04.760
the adult education staff reductions were approved at the september 8th 2020 board meeting

05:10:05.400 --> 05:10:08.440
and that the district worked with their local bargaining unit

05:10:08.440 --> 05:10:13.160
and agreed on a memorandum of understanding specific to the effects of the reductions

05:10:16.360 --> 05:10:20.760
on november 3rd the district submitted another letter stating that the district will be

05:10:20.760 --> 05:10:25.560
rescinding the layoffs of the adult education classified employees that the district intends

05:10:25.560 --> 05:10:31.160
to employ the staff in positions at school sites for distance learning and if the district is

05:10:31.160 --> 05:10:35.880
unable to find new positions for the affected classified employees through december that the

05:10:35.880 --> 05:10:45.160
district will consider revisiting staff reductions at that time once again the district is requesting

05:10:45.160 --> 05:10:51.560
to waive the sealed bid and highest bidder process to lease surplus property cde staff recommends

05:10:51.560 --> 05:10:56.760
approval of this waiver request with the conditions that are mentioned earlier as cde believes that

05:10:56.840 --> 05:11:00.200
the bargaining units were afforded an adequate level of involvement

05:11:00.200 --> 05:11:03.640
through the correspondence and discussion between the two parties over time

05:11:04.760 --> 05:11:06.680
with that i'd be happy to answer any questions

05:11:09.560 --> 05:11:14.600
i'm going to call on member rucker for some comments in a moment but first if we have the

05:11:15.160 --> 05:11:21.800
could have the public comment slide up it looks like we do um great we're going to open up the

05:11:21.800 --> 05:11:27.080

members of the public remember rucker i turn to you for initial comments sure well first of all

05:11:42.680 --> 05:11:48.360
i do want to thank the staff in the department and the state board staff who have worked very

05:11:48.360 --> 05:11:56.200
diligently on this waiver as you can see the development for this waiver for presentation

05:11:56.200 --> 05:12:02.040
and consideration by the board it's a been a long and winding pathway in the timeline

05:12:02.040 --> 05:12:08.600
that you can see over the course of a year this is an example of something that typically comes

05:12:08.600 --> 05:12:14.520
to the board and we're familiar with in the run-up to the approval of the local control funding

05:12:14.520 --> 05:12:21.080
formula we heard from busloads of parents who came to the state board to plead with the board

05:12:21.080 --> 05:12:27.000
to create metrics and criteria and guidance for districts on what the stakeholder engagement

05:12:27.000 --> 05:12:34.440
process looks like and what it means to honor and take the time to listen to community stakeholder

05:12:34.440 --> 05:12:41.480
input in meaningful ways and so it's important for the purposes of understanding what we're actually

05:12:41.480 --> 05:12:49.160
asked to approve in this waiver to separate a number of things this waiver is simply a request

05:12:49.160 --> 05:12:57.240
by an lea to simplify the process for them to lease this property that they have declared surplus

05:12:57.880 --> 05:13:05.640
what has arisen in the waiver that is completely unrelated to approving the request that they are

05:13:05.640 --> 05:13:12.920
making is the manner in which the development and the stakeholder engagement process for related

05:13:12.920 --> 05:13:21.080
to this waiver unfolded it is it is material to the stakeholders in this community that

05:13:21.080 --> 05:13:27.960
in making their request and giving their input for this waiver that they see connecting approving

05:13:27.960 --> 05:13:33.160
the waiver in some way tacitly approving the behavior of the district and that's not what

05:13:33.240 --> 05:13:40.200
we're doing but having said that it is important to state that this exemplifies very poor leadership

05:13:40.200 --> 05:13:45.000
on the part of the district and how they chose to handle the stakeholder engagement process

05:13:45.560 --> 05:13:51.240
it's not good and it's not adequate when you present a waiver to stakeholders and say we really

05:13:51.240 --> 05:13:55.240
don't need your input we really don't need your approval because we're going to get the waiver

05:13:55.240 --> 05:14:01.880
anyway it's not adequate input to hold a meeting about the waiver and not have the waiver paperwork

05:14:01.880 --> 05:14:08.280
available for the participants to see during the course of the meeting that said that is not

05:14:08.280 --> 05:14:15.960
material to be considering whether or not we're actually going to approve simplifying the process

05:14:15.960 --> 05:14:21.000
for the district to approve the waiver so when it is time after we hear the comments from

05:14:21.000 --> 05:14:26.680
stakeholders who are going to explain to you their frustration with the district on how they felt not

05:14:26.680 --> 05:14:33.480
included and disregarded in the stakeholder process to develop this waiver I am going to recommend

05:14:33.480 --> 05:14:40.280
approval of the waiver but further I think we need to pay attention to and Dr. Darling Hammond and

05:14:40.280 --> 05:14:45.080
board member for Teal Bronson you have worked with the commission on teacher credentialing

05:14:45.080 --> 05:14:50.280
we approve standards for administrators concerning you know criteria for them to receive their

05:14:50.280 --> 05:14:55.000
certification one of the most important elements of that criteria is that they understand their

05:14:55.000 --> 05:15:01.240
role as a leader in working with and supporting the inclusion of stakeholders from the complaints

05:15:01.240 --> 05:15:06.040
that you're going to hear from these stakeholders that did not occur here and this is not unique

05:15:06.040 --> 05:15:12.920
it's not an isolated incident this is for many in many areas it's the norm not the non-exception I

05:15:12.920 --> 05:15:20.600
recall sitting at a different meeting for the for that concerning student student engagement

05:15:20.600 --> 05:15:25.640
and school improvement and when the superintendent was asked point blank well what is your conversation

05:15:25.640 --> 05:15:31.560
been with the stakeholders he says he's not doing that yet so we have a lot of work to do

05:15:31.560 --> 05:15:37.160
in the area of continuous improvement to also continue to improve what our leaders are doing

05:15:37.160 --> 05:15:43.160
to support stakeholder engagement and create norms that don't lead us to be confronted with

05:15:43.160 --> 05:15:50.040
matters like this but again the issue about how the district conducted itself is separate from

05:15:50.040 --> 05:15:55.880
the issue of approving the waiver itself so I would ask my colleagues on the board to listen

05:15:55.880 --> 05:16:01.880
carefully and with great concern to what you hear from the stakeholders that at the same time

05:16:01.880 --> 05:16:06.680
I am going to recommend when it is time for us to look at the waiver that we do approve the

05:16:06.680 --> 05:16:12.040
waiver for the sole purpose of allowing the district to simplify its process to approve a

05:16:12.040 --> 05:16:18.360
lease and to surplus the fact I hope all that makes sense thank you very much and at this point

05:16:18.360 --> 05:16:22.680
we do have a number of people lined up for public comment I do want to acknowledge that

05:16:22.680 --> 05:16:27.400
Kim is back with us on the phone and we'll go on to public comment

05:16:29.960 --> 05:16:35.000
good afternoon caller please state your name and affiliation for the record your time begins now

05:16:40.120 --> 05:16:46.360
hi my name is Jean Alvalar I'm actually the president of the softball league that is at

05:16:46.360 --> 05:16:51.960
this location can you hear me because I'm not sure if you can we can hear you

05:16:53.160 --> 05:17:00.840
okay great okay and I can appreciate what was explained before that we do agree that it wasn't

05:17:00.840 --> 05:17:10.920
adequate adequately transparent to us what was going on we don't feel like we were ever included

05:17:11.000 --> 05:17:15.400
in this decision-making process things tended to just move along without

05:17:16.840 --> 05:17:22.440
things being considered by our community this place has been here for 40 years and it's just

05:17:23.480 --> 05:17:29.480
unfortunate that it's gotten to this point I can appreciate that this is a waiver it's material to

05:17:29.480 --> 05:17:36.840
you but I think it goes a long way just to be on the record as a part of this community that what

05:17:36.840 --> 05:17:44.680
she said was true it's a very heartfelt and we very we very much feel slighted by the school

05:17:44.680 --> 05:17:49.960
district the way they they did this thank you caller thank you

05:17:53.080 --> 05:17:58.040
good afternoon caller please state your name and affiliation for the record your time begins now

05:18:08.520 --> 05:18:12.840
I'm the president of CSCA Torrance chapter 845 I've been a member of the Torrance community for

05:18:12.840 --> 05:18:17.720
the past 38 years we are opposed to waiver requests from Torrance Unified the district

05:18:17.720 --> 05:18:21.720
has refused not only to include us in the development of the waiver and address our concerns

05:18:21.720 --> 05:18:26.600
but has avoided providing us information which continues today the district still doesn't have

05:18:26.600 --> 05:18:32.440
any clear consent concise plan as where our programs will be placed additionally it's been

05:18:32.440 --> 05:18:37.000
a case in recent layoffs with adult ed the district refused to comply with our information request

05:18:37.000 --> 05:18:42.680
until September 17th after the board had approved the layoff on September 8 nearly a month after our

05:18:42.680 --> 05:18:48.680
first request the district misled us to the board to think that the coming up on September 21st

05:18:49.400 --> 05:18:53.480
our recent experience with the district does not promote confidence that our staff students and

05:18:53.480 --> 05:18:57.960
community members will be protected if the state board of education approves this waiver

05:18:57.960 --> 05:19:01.720
we respectfully request that you deny the waiver at this time thank you

05:19:07.160 --> 05:19:11.960
good afternoon caller please state your name and affiliation for the record your time starts now

05:19:16.200 --> 05:19:20.520
my name is dr linda scott and i'm calling for item 10

05:19:21.320 --> 05:19:25.160
of the waiver this is not item 10 please call back later

05:19:31.560 --> 05:19:36.360
good afternoon caller please state your name and affiliation for the record your time begins now

05:19:41.400 --> 05:19:45.960
good afternoon members of the board and thank you for this time i am dr keith butler

05:19:45.960 --> 05:19:50.120
chief business officer for the torrance unified school district since july of this year

05:19:51.000 --> 05:19:56.200
our adult education program has lost significant funding this year from both state and federal

05:19:56.200 --> 05:20:02.600
sources as a result we conducted multiple negotiation sessions with our local csa 845

05:20:03.240 --> 05:20:09.000
resulting in an agreement september 22nd regarding the impacts and effects of these adult education

05:20:09.000 --> 05:20:14.840
layoffs to hear these layoffs as somehow being tied now to the waiver application is completely

05:20:14.840 --> 05:20:20.920
incorrect to make the point clear we agreed this week to receive those layoffs and i am working

05:20:20.920 --> 05:20:27.240
with human resources to find long-term positions for those employees if possible while this action

05:20:27.240 --> 05:20:31.880
does hurt our general fund in the present i know that the waiver is very important to the fiscal

05:20:31.880 --> 05:20:37.560
health of our district for the long term i hope this board recognizes that we have been transparent

05:20:37.560 --> 05:20:42.760
about this process since it began and that this waiver request is truly in the best interest of

05:20:42.760 --> 05:20:44.600
all parties thank you

05:20:48.040 --> 05:20:52.760
good afternoon caller please state your name and affiliation for the record your time begins now

my name is kay peterson and i am the vice president of csh torrance chapter 19

05:21:03.640 --> 05:21:08.360
we are opposed to the waiver request from torrance unified we are deeply concerned with the

05:21:08.360 --> 05:21:13.880
lack of transparency and the inclusion in the development of the waiver at no point in time has

05:21:13.880 --> 05:21:19.240
the district included us in any meaningful way in the development of the waiver or satisfactorily

05:21:19.240 --> 05:21:25.160
addressed our concerns regarding the impact of the waiver that would have upon students and staff

05:21:25.160 --> 05:21:29.960
our members are fearful that the approval of the waiver will result in the elimination of the adult

05:21:29.960 --> 05:21:34.680
education program they are concerned not only with their own job security but with these

05:21:34.680 --> 05:21:39.080
programs that will be taken away from the computer community where many of our members

05:21:39.080 --> 05:21:44.760
and their children have benefited directly from these programs we respectfully request that you

05:21:44.760 --> 05:21:53.640
deny the waiver thank you good afternoon caller please state your name and affiliation for the

05:21:53.640 --> 05:21:55.320
record your time begins now

05:21:58.920 --> 05:22:02.440
good afternoon esteemed board members superintendent and support staff

05:22:02.440 --> 05:22:08.360
i'm dr tim stowe t usd interim superintendent since 1975 i've been fully invested in the

05:22:08.360 --> 05:22:13.960
torrance unified school district as a student a teacher a parent a principal and other administrative

05:22:13.960 --> 05:22:18.360
roles i live and breathe what is best for our students our staff and our community

05:22:19.160 --> 05:22:23.960
i've been involved in the potential lease of the hamilton property since our board formed a 7-eleven

05:22:23.960 --> 05:22:28.120
committee and have been responsible for the outreach to keep the community informed and

05:22:28.120 --> 05:22:32.840
engaged for more than three years what you see before you in the waiver application meets all

05:22:32.840 --> 05:22:38.520
cde requirements including significant consultation with our labor partners i respect our labor

05:22:38.520 --> 05:22:43.320
partners but i respectfully disagree with any contention that this has been a closed process

05:22:43.960 --> 05:22:50.040
what i do know is that a negotiated lease will provide the absolute best possible terms to

05:22:50.040 --> 05:22:55.800
benefit our students our labor partners and our community thus i respectfully request approval

05:22:55.800 --> 05:22:57.400
of our waiver request thank you

05:23:01.720 --> 05:23:06.600

05:23:14.280 --> 05:23:18.680
good morning madam chair superintendent thurman and sb members my name is robert duwitz and i

05:23:18.680 --> 05:23:23.960
represent the classified employees in torrance chapters 19 and 845 we are opposed to the waiver

05:23:23.960 --> 05:23:28.680
request from torrance unified this waiver impacts adult education programs the special

05:23:28.680 --> 05:23:33.240
education transition program and the ball field heavily used by the community the district has

05:23:33.240 --> 05:23:37.800
continued to refuse including us in the development of waivers despite continued promises to provide

05:23:37.800 --> 05:23:42.600
us a copy of the draft waiver spanning nearly a year the district only provided us with a copy

05:23:42.600 --> 05:23:47.160
they intended to submit less than five business days to submission the district continues to

05:23:47.160 --> 05:23:51.560
mischaracterize its meetings with us which have been cursory and superficial to date the district

05:23:51.560 --> 05:23:55.960
has offered no substantial assessment or response of its capacity to protect these vital programs

05:23:55.960 --> 05:24:00.440
and services instead communicating that while the approval of the waiver may permit it they

05:24:00.440 --> 05:24:04.840
have no obligation to do so we implore you to make the district's blatant lack of respect and

05:24:04.840 --> 05:24:09.720
disregard for our involvement of primary consideration in your determination we respectfully request that

05:24:09.720 --> 05:24:17.400
you deny the waiver thank you good afternoon caller please state your name and affiliation

05:24:17.400 --> 05:24:19.480

hi my name is alan glassband and i represent the community of north torrance and general

05:24:29.720 --> 05:24:35.960
i was a board member at the little league when this began and like many other people including

05:24:35.960 --> 05:24:40.760
somebody from your own board mentioned the school district handled this were in a really poor

05:24:40.760 --> 05:24:47.000
fashion lack of transparency has been always been the problem unlike what the superintendent still

05:24:47.000 --> 05:24:53.880
mentioned they did not include us in any of the conversations other than duly noted and we'll march

05:24:53.880 --> 05:24:59.480
on with our own opinion of what has to happen in your community there's a high special needs group

05:24:59.480 --> 05:25:04.360
that will not be able to go anywhere else there are elderly people who can't take classes and

05:25:04.360 --> 05:25:10.120
they started cutting them a few years ago in preparation to try to sell this property they

05:25:10.120 --> 05:25:16.120
actually falsified information on your own application when they said that there was no

05:25:16.120 --> 05:25:20.600
objection from the 7-eleven committee there are actually two nay votes with objections

05:25:22.280 --> 05:25:27.160
because of community opposition and those were not included on your application

05:25:27.160 --> 05:25:32.200
time or other instances i only have one minute thank you caller thanks thank you

05:25:36.200 --> 05:25:40.920
good afternoon caller please state your name and affiliation for the record your time begins now

05:25:46.120 --> 05:25:51.000
good afternoon my name is michael juba and i am a classroom teacher representing the california

05:25:51.000 --> 05:25:57.000
teachers association cta is extremely concerned with the waiver request from torrance unified

05:25:57.720 --> 05:26:02.520
past waivers of this sort have been for properties that are empty lots or empty buildings

05:26:03.160 --> 05:26:08.600
we are hard pressed to understand how a building that houses a significant number of programs with

05:26:09.240 --> 05:26:15.960
no plan for relocation can be deemed surplus cta supports our local association's opposition

05:26:15.960 --> 05:26:23.560
to this waiver request as well as the opposition from our labor partners at csa cta recommends the

05:26:23.560 --> 05:26:28.520
state board reject the waiver and ask torrance unified school district to conduct authentic

05:26:28.520 --> 05:26:33.480
stakeholder engagement with community stakeholders and specifically with the bargaining units and

05:26:33.480 --> 05:26:40.120
good faith most importantly torrance unified must ensure that the best interest of the students

05:26:40.120 --> 05:26:46.520
served in these programs are met by protecting these programs currently housed at the site in

05:26:46.520 --> 05:26:56.040
question thank you good afternoon caller please state your name and affiliation for the record

05:26:56.120 --> 05:27:10.600
your time begins now

05:27:12.120 --> 05:27:16.600
this is not general public comment please call back later okay okay thank you

05:27:20.280 --> 05:27:24.920
good afternoon caller please state your name and affiliation for the record your time begins now

05:27:26.120 --> 05:27:31.000
Madam President, Board Members, Superintendent Thurmond, my name is Dolores Duran-Flores and I

05:27:31.000 --> 05:27:37.080
represent the California School Employees Association and we oppose this waiver. We urge you to deny it

05:27:37.080 --> 05:27:43.160
because the district failed to meet three criteria set forth in the reasons for denial. First, the

05:27:43.160 --> 05:27:47.400
educational needs of the students are not adequately addressed. In fact, nobody knows what will happen

05:27:47.400 --> 05:27:52.680
to the programs and the students because the district hasn't told us. Secondly, school personnel

05:27:52.680 --> 05:27:57.640
protections are just sized. The district approved laying off 10 of our instructional aids at this

05:27:57.640 --> 05:28:02.520
site. Only after the superintendent Thurmond inquired about the way off did the district rescind

05:28:02.520 --> 05:28:08.120
nine and only until possibly December. While we appreciate the superintendent's help, the district

05:28:08.120 --> 05:28:13.000
failed to meet this requirement and finally the union was not a participant in the development

05:28:13.000 --> 05:28:17.960
of the waiver. The district had two waiver meetings that didn't provide a copy of the waiver.

05:28:18.280 --> 05:28:25.800
You can't involve us in the development of the waiver when you don't even have a copy of it.

05:28:25.800 --> 05:28:31.000
The district failed to meet this requirement. For these reasons we urge you to deny this waiver.

05:28:35.080 --> 05:28:42.360
This concludes public comment. Perfect, thank you very much. At this point

05:28:43.320 --> 05:28:50.200
we want to open up for board discussion. Board members please you know raise your hands in the

05:28:50.200 --> 05:29:01.080
participant list if you have a comment or a question. Give it a little wait time.

05:29:01.080 --> 05:29:18.760
All right. So seeing no questions or comments, I wonder if someone would like to make a motion.

05:29:20.920 --> 05:29:26.360
I would like to ask the staff to put the slide with the staff recommendation

05:29:26.440 --> 05:29:28.840
on the screen again please. Thank you.

05:29:36.280 --> 05:29:42.440
Okay so you can see on this recommendation there are basically four parts to this

05:29:42.440 --> 05:29:48.920
recommendation. First of all the department does recommend approving the waiver. The approval

05:29:49.000 --> 05:29:56.680
of the waiver is approving simplifying the process for the district to be able to lease

05:29:57.240 --> 05:30:03.560
and simplifying the bidding process so that they can have other factors that they can consider

05:30:04.120 --> 05:30:13.400
in approving a lease of the property in addition to other criteria other than the highest bid as

05:30:13.480 --> 05:30:19.800
there as the consideration. That's the first part of what is being recommended in the waiver

05:30:19.800 --> 05:30:27.240
and that is the only thing that is material to the waiver itself as it relates to the sections

05:30:27.240 --> 05:30:32.200
of the ed code statute. Leave it on that section. Leave it on that slide please.

05:30:35.000 --> 05:30:41.560
As it relates to the ed code sections that the district is seeking but based on the comments

05:30:41.560 --> 05:30:48.200
that you heard from the stakeholders on a lot of the work that has been done by department staff,

05:30:48.200 --> 05:30:52.920
by state board staff, and as you also heard from the superintendent's office,

05:30:54.040 --> 05:31:02.680
we are recommending these additional conditions as part of the approval of the waiver. The first

05:31:02.680 --> 05:31:12.040
recommendation requires a public hearing. The first recommendation that requires that the

05:31:12.040 --> 05:31:18.040
governing board determines what's the most desirable way where the proposal can be received

05:31:18.040 --> 05:31:25.240
and the reasons for that determination and include that in the minute. The second recommendation

05:31:25.240 --> 05:31:31.800
is that prior to entering into negotiations that the governing board hold a public hearing with

05:31:31.800 --> 05:31:37.320
the members of the public including labor organizations to discuss the issues about the

05:31:37.320 --> 05:31:43.080
relocation of the programs that are currently operating at the property. The most important

05:31:43.080 --> 05:31:48.520
concern you heard from the stakeholders is that they do not believe the district has actually

05:31:48.520 --> 05:31:53.960
exercised its due diligence to protect the students or the programs that are involved in figure out a

05:31:53.960 --> 05:32:01.000
way to maintain the integrity and the continuation of those programs. And second and finally this is

05:32:01.000 --> 05:32:06.360
a waiver that only applies to the lease of the property if the district decides to sell the

05:32:06.360 --> 05:32:12.360
property they will need to go through this process again and they will need to consider if they're

05:32:12.360 --> 05:32:18.840
going to support provide another waiver request. The department staff believes particularly with

05:32:18.840 --> 05:32:25.640
the inclusion of the requirement for a meaningful stakeholder engagement process in a public hearing

05:32:26.280 --> 05:32:32.760
that and the fact that we have made clear and put sunshine on what the concerns are that the

05:32:32.760 --> 05:32:37.960
community has in the way that the district has conducted the process to get to the waiver at

05:32:37.960 --> 05:32:44.200
this point. While it hasn't solved the conflict or the norms of the culture of stakeholder engagement

05:32:44.200 --> 05:32:50.920
in the district it has it has raised the level of expectation from the department and the board

05:32:50.920 --> 05:32:58.600
to the district about what should be done going forward to try to qualm and calm down

05:32:58.600 --> 05:33:03.320
some of the concerns that have been raised. So because of these three conditions and

05:33:04.040 --> 05:33:12.200
we do feel that these conditions do attempt to try to carve out some way of creating some ways

05:33:12.200 --> 05:33:18.840
for the stakeholders to mediate their concerns and at the same time raise some accountability

05:33:18.840 --> 05:33:24.040
for the district in the ways that they work with their relationship with their stakeholders on this

05:33:24.040 --> 05:33:31.000
particular project we think that this waiver should be I do recommend approval of the of the

05:33:31.000 --> 05:33:36.920
waiver for the lease of the property with these with these conditions in place. That's my motion.

05:33:37.560 --> 05:33:43.400
Thank you. Is there a second? I second. Thank you very much.

05:33:43.400 --> 05:33:45.480
Is there any further discussion from the board?

05:33:49.400 --> 05:33:57.800
Seeing no hands we'll ask Brooks to do a roll call vote. Member Burr?

05:33:58.920 --> 05:34:01.080
Aye. President Darling-Hammond?

05:34:02.040 --> 05:34:03.720
Aye. Member Fatah?

05:34:04.840 --> 05:34:06.840
Aye. Member Glover-Woods?

05:34:07.960 --> 05:34:09.720
Aye. Member McQuillan?

05:34:11.160 --> 05:34:12.760
Yes. Member Navo?

05:34:13.560 --> 05:34:15.880
Aye. Member Patil-Brownson?

05:34:15.880 --> 05:34:20.200
Yes. Member Rodriguez?

05:34:21.720 --> 05:34:23.320
Yes. Member Rucker?

05:34:24.440 --> 05:34:26.440
Yes. Vice President Strauss?

05:34:27.240 --> 05:34:28.920
Yes. Member Son?

05:34:30.280 --> 05:34:32.600
Aye. It's approved unanimously.

05:34:34.280 --> 05:34:39.320
Thank you very much and thank you Juan for that clear presentation. We appreciate it.

05:34:40.280 --> 05:34:45.880
We're now up to agenda item 9 which is the last one. I'm not sure if it's the last one for the

05:34:45.880 --> 05:34:52.120
day but it is our next one. I'm going to hand the gavel to Vice President Strauss for this item

05:34:52.120 --> 05:34:59.400
because I have to step out for another meeting short. Okay so we are now going to hear item 9

05:35:00.520 --> 05:35:05.720
which is a retroactive request for funding for three non-classroom based charter schools.

05:35:06.680 --> 05:35:11.880
This item will be presented by Stephanie Farland from CDE. So Stephanie would you please begin?

05:35:13.240 --> 05:35:19.160
Good afternoon Vice President Strauss, Board Members, Chief Deputy Gregson.

05:35:20.520 --> 05:35:27.000
We are here today to present items 9 and 10 both on funding determinations. I'm going to

05:35:27.640 --> 05:35:33.560
hand it over to McKenna Huey who is the manager in our division that is the expert on funding

05:35:33.560 --> 05:35:40.680
determinations and conducts all the reviews to go over the item, the first item, item 9 and then

05:35:40.680 --> 05:35:54.680
we'll both be around for questions. Good afternoon State Board Members. My name is McKenna Huey

05:35:54.680 --> 05:35:59.480
representing the charter schools division and I will be presenting item 9 of today's meeting agenda.

05:35:59.480 --> 05:36:09.080
So prior to jumping into item 9 just a brief update on funding determinations. So for the next

05:36:09.080 --> 05:36:14.120
two fiscal years the CDE anticipates that the State Board will hear fewer funding determination

05:36:14.120 --> 05:36:20.680
items as a result of the passage of Senate Bill 820 which modifies the request process for existing

05:36:20.680 --> 05:36:28.440
non-classroom based charter schools for fiscal years 2020 to 21 and 2021 to 2022. So additional

05:36:28.440 --> 05:36:32.840
information regarding this bill and its implications on the funding determination process

05:36:32.840 --> 05:36:36.520
will be provided in item 13 of tomorrow's meeting agenda.

05:36:39.240 --> 05:36:44.680
So getting back to item 9 this item consists of retroactive requests for determination of funding

05:36:44.680 --> 05:36:50.280
for three renewing non-classroom based charter schools, Horizon Charter, Guahome Learning Center

05:36:50.280 --> 05:36:59.320
and Loma Vista Charter. So the CDE uses the term retroactive to refer to determination of funding

05:36:59.320 --> 05:37:04.360
requests submitted after the regulatory deadline. For existing non-classroom based charter schools

05:37:04.360 --> 05:37:09.000
this deadline is February 1 of the fiscal year prior to the year the school's current funding

05:37:09.000 --> 05:37:14.520
determination expires. All schools presented in this item fail to submit their funding determination

05:37:14.520 --> 05:37:20.440
request for renewal by the February 1 deadline. As such they were required to obtain a waiver

05:37:20.440 --> 05:37:25.400
permitting them to submit the request after the deadline and waivers were submitted for all schools

05:37:25.400 --> 05:37:35.080
and were approved by the State Board at its July 2020 meeting. So upon the State Board's approval

05:37:35.080 --> 05:37:40.120
of the waivers the CDE reviewed each school's request for determination of funding. In order

05:37:40.120 --> 05:37:45.000
to receive 100% funding for its non-classroom based instruction charter schools are required

05:37:45.000 --> 05:37:51.400
to meet specific criteria which are detailed on this slide and are as follows. Spend at least 40%

05:37:51.400 --> 05:37:57.400
of its public revenues on instructional certificated salaries and benefits. Spend at least 80% of its

05:37:57.400 --> 05:38:02.840
total revenues on instruction and instructional services and maintain a people to teacher ratio

05:38:02.840 --> 05:38:08.440
that does not exceed 25 to 1 or an equivalent people to teacher ratio of the largest unified

05:38:08.440 --> 05:38:11.800
school district in the county or counties in which the charter school operates.

05:38:13.560 --> 05:38:19.320
So based upon CDE staff's review Horizon Charter and Wilma Vista Charter meet the criteria for a

05:38:19.320 --> 05:38:24.680
100% determination of funding. Guahome Learning Center does not meet the criteria to be eligible

05:38:24.680 --> 05:38:30.520
for a 100% funding as it did not spend at least 80% of its instruction and instructional related

05:38:30.520 --> 05:38:38.360
services. Rather this school qualifies for an 85% funding level which is the level of funding

05:38:38.360 --> 05:38:44.280
that the school did end up requesting. So each school's exact spending percentages and people

05:38:44.280 --> 05:38:50.200
teacher ratio information is provided in attachment one of this item and detailed information regarding

05:38:50.200 --> 05:38:55.720
each school's respective revenues and expenditures can be found in their funding determination forms

05:38:55.720 --> 05:39:00.520
which are provided as attachments two through four of item one of the October

05:39:00.520 --> 05:39:10.200
ACCS meeting agenda which is linked in this item. So for an existing non-classroom based charter

05:39:10.200 --> 05:39:14.760
school regulations state that an approved funding determination shall be for a minimum period of two

05:39:14.760 --> 05:39:20.520
years and a maximum period of five years. Unless a shorter period is requested by the school it is

05:39:20.520 --> 05:39:26.600
the CDE's current practice to propose a funding determination period of three years for charter

05:39:26.600 --> 05:39:31.320
schools that are seeking renewal of their funding determination for the first time and a period of

05:39:31.320 --> 05:39:36.840
four years for schools that have gone through this renewal process one or more times. So all schools

05:39:36.840 --> 05:39:41.560
in this item have gone through the renewal process more than one time their funding determination

05:39:41.560 --> 05:39:46.200
periods have been recommended accordingly with the exception of Guahome Learning Center which

05:39:46.200 --> 05:39:49.160
requested a funding determination period of two years.

05:39:55.480 --> 05:40:00.200
So at the October ACCS meeting it was requested that the CDE share the school

05:40:00.200 --> 05:40:05.480
budgets used to complete the funding determination forms and the CDE would like to make it clear that

05:40:05.480 --> 05:40:10.760
the budget is not required to be submitted as budget information is not used to complete the

05:40:10.760 --> 05:40:15.720
funding determination form for renewing our existing charter schools rather these schools

05:40:16.440 --> 05:40:22.840
use audited financial data. So upon the receipt of a complete funding determination form CDE staff

05:40:22.840 --> 05:40:28.680
compare the information submitted in the form to the school's actual audit and those audits are

05:40:28.680 --> 05:40:34.840
housed in the school fiscal services division of the department. So also at the October ACCS

05:40:34.840 --> 05:40:39.560
meeting concerns regarding each of these schools funding determinations requests were brought up

05:40:40.520 --> 05:40:46.440
the ACCS's concerns primarily focused on the school's high level of reserves expenses paid

05:40:46.440 --> 05:40:53.400
to other agencies and the terms of the school's board members. So the CDE notes that maintaining

05:40:53.400 --> 05:40:58.040
high reserves are not typically a cause for concern or reason for the CDE to grant a lesser

05:40:58.040 --> 05:41:04.280
amount or deny a funding determination request pursuant to regulations if a charter school meets

05:41:04.280 --> 05:41:10.200
the 4080 spending criteria and the people teacher ratio requirements the ACCS shall recommend that

05:41:10.200 --> 05:41:14.840
the state board approve the request at 100 percent unless there is a reasonable basis to

05:41:14.840 --> 05:41:23.080
recommend otherwise. So after the October ACCS meeting CDE staff did reach out to all the schools

05:41:23.080 --> 05:41:27.160
for clarification on the specific points of concern that were raised by the commissioners

05:41:27.800 --> 05:41:31.480
and all schools were responsive to the CDE's request for more information.

05:41:31.480 --> 05:41:38.040
Horizon Charter cited as reasons for the high reserves as being in the process of restructuring

05:41:38.040 --> 05:41:43.640
its budget and updating its multi-year production for the first interim report. The school also

05:41:43.640 --> 05:41:48.760
stated that they are setting aside funding to open a resource center in its authorizers district

05:41:49.400 --> 05:41:53.560
and regarding its expense to write Engel productions which was something that was also

05:41:53.560 --> 05:41:59.800
brought up by the ACCS. Horizon Charter provided documentation to support that its contract

05:41:59.800 --> 05:42:05.320
with write Engel productions was for advertising partnerships social media marketing and so on and

05:42:05.320 --> 05:42:13.320
so forth. Guahome Learning Center they cited multiple reasons for their high reserves including

05:42:14.360 --> 05:42:20.760
they are saving for new facilities they also plan to use that money to maintain full operations

05:42:20.760 --> 05:42:25.480
and continue providing all their services to students while being funded at 85 percent for

05:42:26.200 --> 05:42:33.320
the next two years. They're also saving for additional uncertainties due to the COVID pandemic.

05:42:34.280 --> 05:42:38.760
And regarding this charter school's board members and their expired terms

05:42:38.760 --> 05:42:43.720
the school did provide an updated list of their board members with current terms to the CDE.

05:42:45.080 --> 05:42:51.160
And then the last charter school Loma Vista Charter their authorizer provided information to us and

05:42:51.160 --> 05:42:55.480
cited reasons for their high reserves as being that the authorizers are

05:42:56.600 --> 05:43:02.760
charging the school a little bit less for support services provided. The authorizer has stated

05:43:02.760 --> 05:43:07.800
though that it will charge the school more in order to spend on the school's reserves if it

05:43:07.800 --> 05:43:16.440
continues to be deemed an issue. So upon the completion of these three funding determination

05:43:16.440 --> 05:43:22.440
requests review the CDE finds that all requests are reasonable and adequately supported and

05:43:22.440 --> 05:43:26.600
recommends that the state board approve the determination of funding requests for Horizon

05:43:26.600 --> 05:43:32.040
Charter and Loma Vista Charter at 100 percent for four years and the determination of funding

05:43:32.040 --> 05:43:37.560
request for Guahome Learning Center at 85 percent for two years as requested by the charter school.

05:43:38.200 --> 05:43:45.240
And at its October meeting the ACCS moved to approve CDE staff's recommendation and that motion

05:43:45.240 --> 05:43:49.560
passed by a vote of eight to one. Thank you for your consideration of this item and I'm

05:43:49.560 --> 05:43:56.040
happy to answer any clarifying questions the board will have. Thank you so much for the presentation

05:43:56.040 --> 05:44:02.520
and for the follow-up on the questions that were raised at ACCS. So would we put up the slide for

05:44:02.520 --> 05:44:14.040
public comment? Members of the public can comment on this item by calling 712-432-0075 and entering

05:44:14.040 --> 05:44:21.800
the access code 651905. So while we're waiting for members of the public to call in I first

05:44:21.800 --> 05:44:28.120
want to ask members Burr and Son or our liaisons to ACCS if they have any initial comments then

05:44:28.120 --> 05:44:32.520
I'll ask board members if they want to ask one clarifying question or make a comment before we

05:44:32.520 --> 05:44:38.760
go to public comment then we'll go to board discussion. So raise your hand in the zoom panel

05:44:38.760 --> 05:44:45.240
if you have a clarifying question and I'll move to member Burr and Son for some initial comments.

05:44:49.240 --> 05:44:54.040
I'm going to defer to Ting because she attended the ACCS. I was not able to attend.

05:44:55.880 --> 05:45:02.200
Yeah and I just wanted also to thank the staff for following up on the questions from the ACCS

05:45:02.920 --> 05:45:10.040
meeting and from the commissioners there. These funding requests have become come under more and

05:45:10.040 --> 05:45:16.440
more scrutiny as you know we have seen over the last few months here and you know I would just

05:45:16.440 --> 05:45:24.600
kind of emphasize that these are funding determinations go through real thorough scrutiny

05:45:24.600 --> 05:45:31.560
by the CDE staff having had a school that has gone through this process and that they are following

05:45:31.560 --> 05:45:37.160
the regulations that have been established for the the review of these determinations.

05:45:37.160 --> 05:45:44.360
I do think that these regulations are 20 plus years old and that I think we might want to

05:45:44.360 --> 05:45:51.080
relook at those regs and I'm hoping that we get an opportunity to be able to review funding

05:45:51.080 --> 05:46:00.440
determinations in the process in the future. Thank you member Son. So do we have any

05:46:01.240 --> 05:46:06.760
clarifying questions before we go to public comment? I don't see any hands up.

05:46:08.840 --> 05:46:16.600
So do we have any public comment available? Yes. Go ahead. We do have public commenters.

05:46:17.560 --> 05:46:22.520
Good afternoon callers. State please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time

05:46:22.520 --> 05:46:30.840
begins now. Dr. Linda Scott. I'm affiliated with WEB Du Bois Public Charter School. That is also

05:46:30.840 --> 05:46:37.240
up for waiver. Excuse me. There's a delay between the computer and the phone. That is the next item.

05:46:37.240 --> 05:46:40.840
Please call back then. Okay.

05:46:40.840 --> 05:46:45.960
Good afternoon callers. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time begins now.

05:46:51.800 --> 05:46:55.240
Good afternoon everyone. My name is Kevin Humphrey and I'm the superintendent of

05:46:55.240 --> 05:46:59.480
Guahomey schools. I oversee the Guahomey learning centers which is a small independent study

05:47:00.120 --> 05:47:06.120
learning program that is a part of the program. I'm the superintendent of Guahomey

05:47:06.120 --> 05:47:09.240
I oversee the Guahomey learning centers which is a small independent study

05:47:09.960 --> 05:47:14.520
learning program that serves about 100 students in Vista, California. We provide support to

05:47:14.520 --> 05:47:19.160
families who are looking for a blended learning model for their students. Many of our high school

05:47:19.160 --> 05:47:23.640
students utilize our program for credit recovery purposes. The Guahomey learning center's facility

05:47:23.640 --> 05:47:27.560
is currently located in one of our lobbies of Guahomey Park Academy. We are in the process

05:47:27.560 --> 05:47:31.560
of looking for a facility to better meet the needs of our students. A facility that will help

05:47:31.560 --> 05:47:36.040
us provide more one-on-one support and intervention for our students. We apologize for missing an

05:47:36.360 --> 05:47:40.200
classroom-based funding determination deadline and we have installed protocols to ensure that

05:47:40.200 --> 05:47:44.360
it doesn't happen again. We hope that we can get past this bump in the road and continue to meet

05:47:44.360 --> 05:47:48.840
the needs of some of our most vulnerable students within our community and we appreciate your

05:47:48.840 --> 05:47:52.520
we appreciate your support in doing so. Thank you for the opportunity to speak.

05:47:57.000 --> 05:48:01.640
Good afternoon caller. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:48:06.200 --> 05:48:09.400
Hello, my name is Dodd-DeFratz. I am a...

05:48:10.440 --> 05:48:17.400
Is this public comment? Is there no public comment? I know. Okay.

05:48:21.160 --> 05:48:25.880
Good afternoon caller. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:48:30.200 --> 05:48:35.640
SBE members Sheila Whitley classroom teacher speaking for California teachers association.

05:48:35.640 --> 05:48:40.680
CTA would like to express our continued concerns with the funding determinations of non-classroom

05:48:40.680 --> 05:48:44.920
based charters. In our letter we called out a variety of issues but I would like to discuss

05:48:44.920 --> 05:48:51.640
the following. They each have very large reserves ranging from 41 percent to 159 percent. These funds

05:48:51.640 --> 05:48:57.240
should be spent on the classroom for the benefit of students. Horizon charter has sizable expenses

05:48:57.240 --> 05:49:04.920
of more than $549,000 going to a closed NCB that is run by their own administrator and a public

05:49:04.920 --> 05:49:11.880
relations contract of more than $445,000. At Guaynomi Learning Center there appears to be

05:49:11.880 --> 05:49:18.120
a conflict of interest between GLC and Guaynomi Park Academy with overlapping board members staff

05:49:18.120 --> 05:49:25.080
and GLC sending 18 percent of their budgets to GPA. CTA questions the need for 100 percent funding

05:49:25.080 --> 05:49:30.520
determinations for the NCBs during the lack of transparency and sizable reserves they each have.

05:49:31.160 --> 05:49:35.880
Additionally CTA believes that CDE must also share the NCB budget time

05:49:35.880 --> 05:49:40.280
submitted with the determination of funding request forms to help ensure that another

05:49:42.680 --> 05:49:44.120
that concludes public comment.

05:49:47.400 --> 05:49:52.040
Thank you. We'll open up for board discussion now so board members please remember to raise

05:49:52.040 --> 05:49:57.560
your hand in the participant panel of zoom if you have a question or a comment. Are there any

05:49:57.560 --> 05:50:06.280
comments from board members? Let's see member Navo. I think Patricia Rucker board member Rucker

05:50:06.280 --> 05:50:13.080
you had your hand up before me so feel free. Okay member Rucker. Oh okay I was just going to say

05:50:13.080 --> 05:50:20.200
you know we've had this is not the first time in the conversation for a board item on funding

05:50:20.200 --> 05:50:25.880
determinations that I have heard from board member Sun that there is a need to revisit

05:50:25.880 --> 05:50:31.400
the regulations and our criteria because they seem to be out of date. I would just like to

05:50:31.400 --> 05:50:38.040
comment on this item when are we going to do that and what exactly is the step that needs to be

05:50:38.040 --> 05:50:44.280
taken because there are there is merit to the concerns that are being raised here about these

05:50:44.280 --> 05:50:51.160
funding determinations especially in a year when we know that there are serious budget concerns for

05:50:51.160 --> 05:50:58.200
all LEAs not just charters and so I'm not sure what is the need for 100% funding determination

05:50:58.200 --> 05:51:05.800
for a school that has a 159% reserve yet the regulations provide the flexibility

05:51:05.800 --> 05:51:11.720
to approve something like that so I do have some concerns about what we need to do and what steps

05:51:11.720 --> 05:51:18.440
need to be taken for us to actually either as a board action to have a public conversation as an

05:51:18.440 --> 05:51:26.520
agenda item or to do the work with staff update and review update and revise this criteria before

05:51:26.520 --> 05:51:31.960
we have another set of funding determinations that look questionable like these do to me.

05:51:33.560 --> 05:51:36.520
Hi thank you member Rucker. Member Novo.

05:51:39.160 --> 05:51:44.440
Actually board member Rucker that was exactly the question I was going to ask it just wasn't

05:51:44.440 --> 05:51:50.520
it wasn't the first time that I've heard the concern around coming back to revisit

05:51:51.240 --> 05:51:58.680
the these regulations that are 20 plus years old so I wanted to just put us a stamp on the reality

05:51:58.680 --> 05:52:04.120
that we do need to have that conversation and I think that even though the the reserves are not

05:52:05.000 --> 05:52:12.280
they're they're not part of the non-funding determinations in the sense that they're not

05:52:12.280 --> 05:52:17.480
part of the decision making for that they do create questions and questions that are probably

05:52:17.480 --> 05:52:24.200
justified when you get with the charters and you have them explained but I would I would just say

05:52:24.200 --> 05:52:31.480
that if if we were looking at these and they were local school districts with that large of reserves

05:52:31.480 --> 05:52:37.160
it would generate questions as well. Thank you member Berger.

05:52:37.960 --> 05:52:43.400
Just a couple comments. Some of the answer about redoing the funding regulations for

05:52:43.400 --> 05:52:48.600
non-classroom based schools will be discussed tomorrow when we talk about the major changes

05:52:48.600 --> 05:52:53.880
that have been made to the charter school law. There will be a moratorium on non-classroom

05:52:53.880 --> 05:53:01.080
based schools for a period of time and so I think and presumably to examine their relevance,

05:53:01.640 --> 05:53:08.920
their appropriateness, their success with students and so a decision will be made about whether or

05:53:08.920 --> 05:53:15.400
not to continue with that modality under charter schools so and I will just say related to the

05:53:15.400 --> 05:53:21.640
change in legislation we will have lots of work to do around charters and all kinds of regulations

05:53:21.640 --> 05:53:27.800
around charters so that's I just put that in the parking lot we'll hear a lot more about that

05:53:27.880 --> 05:53:34.040
tomorrow but in the meantime we do have very specific criteria and I really want to commend

05:53:34.040 --> 05:53:38.600
the department on how they put on the presentation that was made about how they come to these

05:53:38.600 --> 05:53:44.120
decisions. You can tell from our advisory committee on charter schools that there was a compelling

05:53:44.120 --> 05:53:51.080
recommendations they're acting on them based on the department's best advice so some of these

05:53:51.080 --> 05:53:55.080
other questions that come up really are not relevant to the decisions that are being made

05:53:55.080 --> 05:54:00.600
about funding determination so I would just like to suggest that we move forward with this and I'd

05:54:00.600 --> 05:54:05.560
be happy to make a recommendation to adopt the department's recommendation, make a motion to

05:54:05.560 --> 05:54:14.520
adopt the department's recommendation. Do we have a second? Member Sanyu, are you seconding it? Yes.

05:54:14.520 --> 05:54:24.040
Okay so our executive director now will take the roll call vote. Member Burr. Aye. President

05:54:24.040 --> 05:54:36.760
Darlene Hammond. Member Fatah. Aye. Member Glover Woods. Yes. Member McQuillan. Yes. Member Navo. Aye.

05:54:37.560 --> 05:54:38.680
Member Patil Brownson.

05:54:41.480 --> 05:54:44.280
Member Rodriguez. Nay.

05:54:48.440 --> 05:54:53.800
Was that a nay or a yay? I apologize. It was a nay, no. Thank you.

05:54:54.600 --> 05:55:03.720
Member Rucker. No. Member Strauss. Vice President. Yes. Yes. Member Sun. Yes.

05:55:06.920 --> 05:55:08.840
That passes with a vote of seven to two.

05:55:11.000 --> 05:55:17.640
Thank you. So now we're going to move to agenda item 10 which is a retroactive request for funding

05:55:17.640 --> 05:55:21.560
with mitigating circle number one non-classroom based charter school

05:55:22.840 --> 05:55:30.360
and so this item will be presented by Stephanie Farland from CDE. Stephanie and just this is

05:55:30.360 --> 05:55:36.280
actually specified in attachment one just so everyone's aware. Stephanie please begin.

05:55:37.560 --> 05:55:40.920
Thank you Vice President Strauss. I'm going to hand it over again to McKenna Hewie.

05:55:47.960 --> 05:55:53.320
Hello again. Again I'm McKenna Hewie and I'm representing the charter school division and

05:55:53.320 --> 05:56:02.520
I will also be presenting this item to you. So item 10 consists of a retroactive request for

05:56:02.520 --> 05:56:07.800
determination of funding with mitigating circumstances for WEB Dubois public charter.

05:56:11.240 --> 05:56:16.600
So as explained in the last item retroactive requests refer to determination of funding

05:56:16.600 --> 05:56:21.720
requests submitted after the regulatory deadline. So this charter school failed to submit its funding

05:56:21.720 --> 05:56:27.080
determination request by February 1st and they were required to obtain a waiver from the state

05:56:27.080 --> 05:56:39.160
board which was approved at its July 2020 meeting. So once the school obtained an approved waiver

05:56:39.160 --> 05:56:43.560
the CDE reviewed the school's funding request and found that it does not meet the criteria

05:56:43.560 --> 05:56:49.960
for 100% funding. The criteria for full funding is detailed on this slide. The school's exact

05:56:49.960 --> 05:56:54.120
spending percentages and people teacher ratio information can be found in attachment one of

05:56:54.120 --> 05:56:59.240
this item and detailed information regarding the school's revenues and expenditures can be found

05:56:59.240 --> 05:57:03.960
in its funding determination form which is provided as attachment two of item two

05:57:03.960 --> 05:57:06.120
on the October ACCS meeting agenda.

05:57:06.120 --> 05:57:10.840
So when the criteria for full funding are not met regulations permit the advisory commission on

05:57:10.840 --> 05:57:16.360
charter schools to find a reasonable basis also referred to as a mitigating circumstance by which

05:57:16.360 --> 05:57:21.480
to make a recommendation other than one that results from the expenditure criteria to the

05:57:21.480 --> 05:57:26.200
state board. So if the charter school does not meet the designated spending criteria it can

05:57:26.200 --> 05:57:31.560
submit mitigating circumstances for consideration and the charter school does not meet the

05:57:31.960 --> 05:57:37.080
it can submit mitigating circumstances for consideration and these circumstances may

05:57:37.080 --> 05:57:42.440
include documented data regarding individual circumstances of the charter school and or

05:57:42.440 --> 05:57:48.360
one-time expenses or unique or exceptional expenses and without a reason for mitigating

05:57:48.360 --> 05:57:56.600
circumstances a charter school's funding rate may be reduced from 100% to 85 or 70% or may be denied

05:57:56.600 --> 05:58:07.160
at 0%. So WEB Dubois public charter did not meet the criteria for full funding.

05:58:08.280 --> 05:58:13.000
They submitted mitigating circumstances for consideration and cited as their mitigating

05:58:13.000 --> 05:58:19.640
circumstance the need to expend a considerable amount of revenues on facilities as well as a

05:58:19.640 --> 05:58:25.000
decrease in their non-classroom based ADA caused by campus closures resulting from the Anderson

05:58:25.000 --> 05:58:30.440
versus Shasta court decision. So in order to comply with the Anderson court decision the school

05:58:30.440 --> 05:58:35.880
closed two of its three campuses and the school was able to end one lease for one of its closed

05:58:35.880 --> 05:58:42.680
campuses but was still obligated to the lease for its other campus through 2020 to 2021 and

05:58:42.680 --> 05:58:46.680
additional details regarding their request and their reason of mitigating circumstances

05:58:46.760 --> 05:58:48.040
is provided in this item.

05:58:53.160 --> 05:58:58.280
So as I also previously stated for an existing non-classroom based charter school regulations

05:58:58.280 --> 05:59:02.040
state that an approved funding determination shall be for a minimum of two years and a

05:59:02.040 --> 05:59:07.160
maximum of five years although typically the CDE recommends a period of three to four years for

05:59:07.160 --> 05:59:13.240
renewing charter school when considering requests for mitigating circumstances the CDE generally

05:59:13.240 --> 05:59:19.400
proposes a funding determination period of two fiscal years and this permits the CDE to timely

05:59:19.400 --> 05:59:23.880
revisit a school's funding and ensure that the school is meeting the spending requirements outlined

05:59:23.880 --> 05:59:35.880
in regulations. So at the October ACCS meeting concerns regarding WVB Dubois public charter's

05:59:35.880 --> 05:59:41.400
funding determination requests were brought up and are detailed on this slide. The school provided

05:59:41.400 --> 05:59:46.520
the CDE with additional information to clarify the concerns discussed at the ACCS meeting.

05:59:46.520 --> 05:59:52.200
So regarding the leases the school clarified that it is still using the facility of one of the

05:59:52.200 --> 05:59:59.160
campuses that they previously closed and this facility is being used for back office services

05:59:59.160 --> 06:00:04.600
as well as for professional development for staff. The school wanted to make it very clear that they

06:00:04.600 --> 06:00:09.960
are not paying for a facility that they are not using and then regarding the cost of fronting

06:00:09.960 --> 06:00:14.280
their facilities the school stated that the amount that they pay in rent has been the same

06:00:14.280 --> 06:00:20.600
since 2006 and they have and they have also provided their authorizer with comparisons

06:00:20.600 --> 06:00:26.280
for other facilities in the area justifying the amount that they pay in rent. The school also

06:00:26.280 --> 06:00:34.360
clarified that the GAPE is a community-based organization not a charter management organization

06:00:34.920 --> 06:00:39.480
and it gave acts as a parent organization over the two charters that they operate under a

06:00:39.480 --> 06:00:46.760
non-profit status, WVB Dubois being one of them, and all board members are volunteers and they do

06:00:46.760 --> 06:00:58.840
not get paid. So the CDE has determined that the information submitted by WVB Dubois public

06:00:58.840 --> 06:01:03.640
charter supports its claim for mitigating circumstances therefore the CDE recommends that

06:01:03.640 --> 06:01:08.200
the state board approve the school's request for consideration of mitigating circumstances

06:01:08.200 --> 06:01:13.960
and approve the determination of funding request for 100% for a time period of two years as

06:01:13.960 --> 06:01:19.640
outlined in attachment one and at its October meeting the ACCS moved to approve the CDE's

06:01:19.640 --> 06:01:24.680
recommendation and that motion passed by a vote of eight to one. So thank you again for your

06:01:24.680 --> 06:01:28.440
consideration of this item and again I'm happy to answer any clarifying questions.

06:01:29.880 --> 06:01:36.680
So thank you for the presentation and for the follow-up to the questions at ACCS. We're going

06:01:36.680 --> 06:01:41.640
to put up the slide for public comment. Members of the public wishing to provide comment on this

06:01:41.640 --> 06:01:53.720
item may do so by calling area code 712-432-0075 and enter the access code 651-905 pound. So while

06:01:53.720 --> 06:01:58.680
we're waiting for the members of the public to call in I'll ask member Sun if you have any

06:01:58.680 --> 06:02:03.640
initial comments and then I'll ask board members if you want to ask one clarifying question or a

06:02:03.640 --> 06:02:07.560
comment before we go to public comment after that we'll come back for board discussion.

06:02:09.240 --> 06:02:14.840
No specific items on this, I mean no specific comments on this item other than to thank CDE

06:02:14.840 --> 06:02:21.560
staff again for their follow-up. So member Byrne did you want to make a comment?

06:02:23.800 --> 06:02:27.880
No, no specific comments. Thank you. Member Navo?

06:02:27.880 --> 06:02:36.440
No, I forgot to put my hand down. Okay, member Glover Woods?

06:02:37.640 --> 06:02:43.640
I just had a clarifying question and this goes back to the slide around the questions and concerns.

06:02:44.600 --> 06:02:56.120
My question is the Agape LS LLC, are the school board members from W.E.B. DuBois

06:02:56.840 --> 06:03:04.440
also members of that LLC? That's my first question and my second question to that is

06:03:05.000 --> 06:03:14.200
is the Agape LLC the organization that owns any of the buildings that the charter is leasing?

06:03:17.000 --> 06:03:21.480
So that is correct. The board members of the charter school are the same as the board members

06:03:22.440 --> 06:03:37.800
on Agape. I believe Agape owns the facility and they partner with Ellis for that so there's like

06:03:37.800 --> 06:03:51.240
a joint partnership there. Do you want to, while we go for public comment, do you want to go back

06:03:51.400 --> 06:03:56.840
at your notes and take a look at that if you haven't? Yes, I will definitely do that. Okay,

06:03:57.800 --> 06:04:01.640
so let's go to public comment and then we'll come back and clarify member Glover Woods

06:04:01.640 --> 06:04:04.120
questions and any other discussion from board members.

06:04:06.440 --> 06:04:11.160
Good afternoon caller. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

06:04:15.160 --> 06:04:19.400
SBE members, my name is Sheila Fitley and I'm a classroom teacher representing

06:04:19.400 --> 06:04:24.040
the California Teachers Association. In our letters for item 9 and 10, we called out a

06:04:24.040 --> 06:04:29.640
variety of issues but I would like to reiterate the following. W.E.B. DuBois' public charter is

06:04:29.640 --> 06:04:34.280
requesting mitigating circumstances due to having a move from three sites to one site

06:04:34.280 --> 06:04:39.240
after the Anderson case but still having to pay for two sites. For their funding determination

06:04:39.240 --> 06:04:47.880
forum, DuBois is paying $516,000 to Agape Ellis LLC. This group is described as Agape,

06:04:47.880 --> 06:04:53.080
a non-profit has a partnership with the Ellis family for the purposes of partial ownership

06:04:53.080 --> 06:04:57.960
and the leasing of two facilities of our schools. The Agape directors have no personal soccer

06:04:57.960 --> 06:05:03.960
ownership. It is unclear at the least that they cannot be negotiated with this partnership or

06:05:03.960 --> 06:05:10.120
another entity. The three board members of DuBois charter are also board members for the Agape CMO.

06:05:10.120 --> 06:05:15.320
CTA does not believe that these mitigating circumstances are reasonable and therefore W.E.B.

06:05:15.320 --> 06:05:18.600
DuBois should not be 100% funding. Thank you.

06:05:22.360 --> 06:05:27.000
Good afternoon, caller. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time begins now.

06:05:31.800 --> 06:05:39.480
My name is Dr. Linda Scott. I am the CEO of W.E.B. DuBois and Agape schools, the non-profit.

06:05:45.720 --> 06:05:48.520
Did you want to make public comment?

06:05:49.560 --> 06:05:58.440
Yes, I'm sorry. It's a delay between this, but thank you to the state board today for

06:05:58.440 --> 06:06:05.560
allowing me to speak. I was on the call for the commission to clarify some of the questions that

06:06:05.560 --> 06:06:14.120
the union member had and was not allowed to, I was left on hold and was not allowed to provide

06:06:14.120 --> 06:06:20.840
public comment in regards to our school to clarify the question. And so today I wanted to

06:06:20.840 --> 06:06:26.600
say that Agape is not a CMO. Agape is the parent organization to W.E.B. DuBois and

06:06:26.600 --> 06:06:31.480
Carter G. Wilson public charter schools which operate under its non-profit. Our board members

06:06:31.480 --> 06:06:40.440
are all volunteers. And with that being said, Agape LLC does not have the same board as far

06:06:40.440 --> 06:06:50.120
as the lease. Okay, caller, go ahead and respond to the question.

06:06:52.520 --> 06:07:00.200
So I wanted to say, I clarify we're not a CMO. So if the charter was affected, it would directly

06:07:00.200 --> 06:07:05.320
affect the non-profit itself because they operate under the non-profit. And then as far as the Agape

06:07:05.320 --> 06:07:12.200
LLC, they do not have the exact same board members. They're a limited liability corporation

06:07:12.200 --> 06:07:20.120
only formed for the purposes of when the school was built in 05, 06. Caller, your time concludes

06:07:20.120 --> 06:07:32.760
now. Thank you. Do we have any other public comments? Yes, we have one more public comment.

06:07:35.480 --> 06:07:44.280
Hello, is this general public comment? No, this is still not general public comment.

06:07:45.240 --> 06:07:53.400
Sorry, I thought it was public comment for item 10, right? Yeah, sorry. This is item 10. Okay.

06:08:00.440 --> 06:08:02.200
Does that conclude the public comments?

06:08:02.200 --> 06:08:10.920
That concludes the public comment. Okay. So now we'll open up for board discussion.

06:08:10.920 --> 06:08:13.560
And I see member Rucker, you have your hand up.

06:08:16.360 --> 06:08:25.080
Thank you, board member Strauss. This item was confusing to me. I'm still not clear about the

06:08:25.080 --> 06:08:31.480
relationship between the two entities. But that's not what actually confuses me. What really confuses

06:08:31.480 --> 06:08:39.000
me is the lease of the property and where the relationship is there. If the property is owned

06:08:39.000 --> 06:08:46.280
by one of these two entities and the charter is leasing property they no longer use, why can't

06:08:46.280 --> 06:08:52.680
the entity that's overseeing this non-profit charter just simply let them out of the lease?

06:08:52.680 --> 06:08:59.640
So that's not an expense or a contract or consideration for why they're currently

06:08:59.640 --> 06:09:05.720
seeking mitigation. So I'm confused about that. And probably my question is either based on

06:09:05.720 --> 06:09:11.720
a misunderstanding about that relationship or misinformation altogether. But to me it seems

06:09:12.280 --> 06:09:18.440
somebody owns that property who has the authority to let them out of that lease. And the lease

06:09:18.440 --> 06:09:25.080
is a material expense for why they're seeking this mitigation. So I don't get why they just simply

06:09:25.080 --> 06:09:33.000
can't be allowed out of the lease by the entity that is managing them as a non-profit organization.

06:09:33.000 --> 06:09:40.520
So I am confused about that. Thank you, member Rucker. I did know that CDE staff was looking

06:09:40.520 --> 06:09:44.520
at research on their notes. Do you have anything more Stephanie and your team to add?

06:09:46.920 --> 06:09:54.280
Yeah, so we did do a deeper dive after the ACCS meeting into the kind of the lease concerns that

06:09:54.280 --> 06:10:03.960
were brought up at the ACCS meeting. And we did not find really any thing that was super

06:10:03.960 --> 06:10:10.280
concerning that would cause us to change our recommendation. What we can do is we can continue

06:10:10.280 --> 06:10:13.960
to kind of get information from the school. Regulations does permit the State Board of

06:10:13.960 --> 06:10:20.600
Education to request additional documentation and then later go on and modify the funding

06:10:20.600 --> 06:10:27.960
determination level as appropriate or as necessary. And in response to the question

06:10:27.960 --> 06:10:34.120
about the relationship between Agape and Ellis, I believe that is described in the

06:10:34.120 --> 06:10:39.240
funding determination form. I believe it might be on page five. However, unfortunately I don't

06:10:39.240 --> 06:10:45.560
have it in front of me so I can't say for certain. But board members might find some clarification on

06:10:45.560 --> 06:10:51.720
actual funding information. And also this is Stephanie. So there is the option of the

06:10:51.720 --> 06:10:56.360
board not approving mitigating circumstances in which the school will then be funded at 85%.

06:10:56.920 --> 06:11:03.560
So that's an option. Do we have any more comments from board members? I'm just looking

06:11:03.560 --> 06:11:10.840
for any more hands. I don't see any. Board member Strauss, I raised my hand again.

06:11:10.840 --> 06:11:14.280
Oh, sorry. I thought it was the same from before. I apologize. Go ahead.

06:11:14.360 --> 06:11:18.520
No, that's no problem. I've been trying to be diligent about lowering and raising my hand. So

06:11:18.520 --> 06:11:24.760
I understand why. I want to thank the staff, Stephanie, for responding to my question or

06:11:24.760 --> 06:11:32.440
inquiry about the relationship. Let me be emphatic when I make this next statement.

06:11:33.160 --> 06:11:40.040
I don't easily get confused about factual information. And so I'm going to repeat again,

06:11:40.040 --> 06:11:47.080
I am confused about the relationship between these two entities. So I would like to say

06:11:47.080 --> 06:11:53.960
what is provided to me is not clear or plain or transparent or apparent. I can't think of

06:11:53.960 --> 06:12:00.440
any other adjectives to give you, but I don't understand it. Thank you. Do we have any more

06:12:00.440 --> 06:12:06.440
comments or clarifying questions from board members? Vice President Strauss, can I say

06:12:06.440 --> 06:12:12.120
something? This is Stephanie. Please. I did just a second ago give the option of not approving

06:12:12.120 --> 06:12:17.800
mitigating circumstances. But you also can, if you want us to take an even deeper dive,

06:12:19.000 --> 06:12:22.120
we're happy to do that. And then we could bring this item back to

06:12:23.000 --> 06:12:28.280
the December ACCS and the January State Board. So it really, you know, your call.

06:12:28.280 --> 06:12:38.280
Any members? So I appreciate the questions. I appreciate the staff's additional work in

06:12:38.280 --> 06:12:45.960
reviewing some and responding to the questions. Are we starting to move outside of our regulations

06:12:48.040 --> 06:12:55.800
for this process? No regulations do permit the State Board and the department to go back and ask

06:12:55.800 --> 06:13:01.320
for additional information in order to make an accurate recommendation for funding.

06:13:02.520 --> 06:13:07.320
This is Judy Saez. I just want to, it won't hurt the school if we delay until January, correct?

06:13:08.520 --> 06:13:12.760
That's correct. That would be the last meeting that we have. So it won't harm them and delay

06:13:12.760 --> 06:13:20.520
them getting any apportionment or anything like that. Okay. Say, Member Sung, are you

06:13:20.520 --> 06:13:24.840
done with that comment or do you want to say any more before I go to the next board member?

06:13:26.120 --> 06:13:28.600
No, I don't need this anymore. Okay. Member Rodriguez?

06:13:30.200 --> 06:13:36.840
I just also wanted clarification because I really don't feel comfortable with the information that

06:13:36.840 --> 06:13:45.080
we have now. So if it's not violating our rules and we can, you know, just get clarity because I

06:13:45.080 --> 06:13:51.880
really also feel like Member Rucker, I don't have clarity on this. I'm hearing, you know,

06:13:51.880 --> 06:14:00.840
a lot of disparate information. Do I have a motion to continue or a motion to approve?

06:14:00.840 --> 06:14:06.040
Do I have some motion? Member Strauss, this is Judy Saez again. We do not need a motion to

06:14:08.200 --> 06:14:13.240
delay it unless there is the desire to approve it and to make a motion. That's fine. But if the

06:14:13.240 --> 06:14:17.560
desire is to research and get further information, if there's a consensus to do that, then we're happy

06:14:17.560 --> 06:14:22.120
to come back, again, like Stephanie described, and pull it from this and not take any action

06:14:22.120 --> 06:14:28.520
at this time. So I've heard from two board members that they would like some clarification

06:14:28.520 --> 06:14:37.560
of additional information before taking action on our next board agenda. Let's see. How do I do this

06:14:37.560 --> 06:14:46.520
on Zoom? Do I have a Member Burr? Yeah, I just would suggest that because there are questions

06:14:46.520 --> 06:14:55.320
that are unanswered and need clarity that we do delay this until the December ACCS and the January

06:14:55.320 --> 06:15:02.680
board meeting. Thank you. Member Glover-Woods, I see your hand up. Yes, I just wanted to clarify,

06:15:02.680 --> 06:15:08.760
and I would agree it would be very helpful to bring it back. I want to clarify specifically

06:15:08.760 --> 06:15:15.880
what I would like to have more information regarding is the relationship between the LLC

06:15:16.760 --> 06:15:24.200
and the buildings that are leased that are causing the mitigating circumstances.

06:15:25.800 --> 06:15:32.600
So I just want to support all these requests. I know, Stephanie, in the past, we've actually

06:15:32.600 --> 06:15:38.680
had a chart which showed who was related to who and who connected and who was in charge and who

06:15:38.680 --> 06:15:44.440
owned what. And I don't know if once you do the research, you'd be able to explain that to us,

06:15:44.440 --> 06:15:50.120
but I think there's enough concern on the board that we need more clarifying. So we'll ask you to

06:15:50.120 --> 06:15:55.160
follow up on the comments that the board members have asked and to bring it back to ACCS

06:15:55.720 --> 06:16:01.320
in December and in January for the state board meeting. Yes, that's what we'll do.

06:16:02.920 --> 06:16:06.120
Any more comments from board members or any more

06:16:06.120 --> 06:16:11.000
clarification you'd like Stephanie and her team to do before we end this item?

06:16:11.400 --> 06:16:22.280
Okay, then I think this ends that item. And thank you, CDE, for a really thoughtful and

06:16:22.280 --> 06:16:28.840
good presentation to us and we look forward to hearing the next steps at our next meeting.

06:16:28.840 --> 06:16:34.520
So and now we're going to go to item number 12. I hope we haven't lost our public commenter.

06:16:35.240 --> 06:16:41.880
I hope we haven't lost our public commenter. This is general public comment for items that are not

06:16:41.880 --> 06:16:47.160
included on our printed agenda. So we're going to open up the phone line. So this is the number

06:16:47.160 --> 06:17:02.440
that you can't call. Area code 712-432-0075. Enter the access code 651905. And I now ask,

06:17:02.440 --> 06:17:07.960
are there any public comments? We encourage you to state your name and affiliation for the record.

06:17:07.960 --> 06:17:11.800
And remember to turn down the volume on your computer if you're following the live feed.

06:17:11.800 --> 06:17:16.840
Speakers will be limited to one minute. So do we have any public comment? We do.

06:17:22.040 --> 06:17:24.920
Good afternoon, caller. This is general public comment.

06:17:25.720 --> 06:17:29.640
Please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time begins now.

06:17:32.440 --> 06:17:47.080
The caller dropped. Oh, there. There. But wait, there are more. Oh, good. Good afternoon, caller.

06:17:47.080 --> 06:17:51.400
This is general public comment. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time

06:17:51.400 --> 06:18:01.960
begins now. Hello. I called earlier. This is Dr. Linda Scott and it hung up when I was trying to

06:18:01.960 --> 06:18:10.600
explain the affiliation between the LLC and the nonprofit. Caller, this is general public comment.

06:18:10.600 --> 06:18:16.440
This is not the time. My apologies. Okay. I just, I just want to.

06:18:19.080 --> 06:18:22.760
Good afternoon, caller. This is general public comment. Please state your name

06:18:22.760 --> 06:18:25.480
and affiliation for the record. Your time begins now.

06:18:26.200 --> 06:18:35.240
Hello. My name is John Fratch. I'm a freshman and a ninth grade class co-president from San

06:18:35.240 --> 06:18:39.800
Pedro Senior High School. I am calling in to support the recommendations made by the Student

06:18:39.800 --> 06:18:44.440
Advisory Board on Education. I participated in state this weekend and I am honored by the

06:18:44.440 --> 06:18:48.760
presentations made by fellow colleagues and presenters in today's meeting. Student voice

06:18:48.760 --> 06:18:52.440
and utilizing student input in making decisions about our schools is most important to me.

06:18:53.160 --> 06:18:59.080
As an autistic student, I am part of a student population whose input is never solved when it

06:18:59.080 --> 06:19:04.840
comes to decisions that affect student exceptional needs like myself. Student voice, especially in

06:19:04.840 --> 06:19:09.560
student populations whose input is not solved or understood, is needed so that students can be heard

06:19:09.560 --> 06:19:14.920
and included in the decision making. We must, we understand the concerns and needs of our communities.

06:19:14.920 --> 06:19:19.640
We must be able to voice our concerns, our needs, and our recommendations to make our schools better,

06:19:19.640 --> 06:19:23.720
to make our schools what we need them to be successful and reach their potential. Thank you.

06:19:28.760 --> 06:19:31.560
Good afternoon, caller. This is general public comment.

06:19:31.560 --> 06:19:35.480
Please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

06:19:39.560 --> 06:19:45.240
Good afternoon. This is Liz Guillen, Republic Advocates. The LCFS Equity Coalition is concerned

06:19:45.240 --> 06:19:51.480
that the board's agenda omits an item discussing the department's proposed changes to the local

06:19:51.480 --> 06:19:57.400
control and accountability plan annual update template and instructions that were made by this

06:19:57.400 --> 06:20:03.320
year's education budget trailer bills. While the trailer bills changed your role in approving the

06:20:03.320 --> 06:20:09.640
template, making the executive director a consultant in the process, they did not change the role of

06:20:09.640 --> 06:20:15.320
the LCAP as an accountability tool for local district communities to participate in LCAP

06:20:15.320 --> 06:20:23.640
development in an informed way. The revisions are significant. They reflect new requirements of the

06:20:23.640 --> 06:20:30.600
local continuity plan for districts to address learning loss as a condition of receiving millions

06:20:30.600 --> 06:20:35.960
in state and federal dollars. We think this is a big deal and should not have been omitted from

06:20:35.960 --> 06:20:41.960
your discussion. We're very concerned that the revisions will not adequately provide LEAs with

06:20:41.960 --> 06:20:54.760
enough guidance. We urge you to ensure this goes to CPAC. There is no further public comment.

06:20:56.120 --> 06:21:02.920
So thank you. So before I announce the end of the meeting, I want to say that we're going to

06:21:02.920 --> 06:21:08.440
continue our meeting at 8.30 tomorrow morning with closed session to discuss the following

06:21:08.440 --> 06:21:14.840
legal manners, Martinez versus Newsom, today's fresh start versus Englewood Unified School District,

06:21:14.840 --> 06:21:19.640
Los Angeles County Office of Education, California Department of Education and the State Board of

06:21:19.640 --> 06:21:26.600
Education. We're anticipating that we will come back into public session between 8.45 and 9 o'clock

06:21:26.600 --> 06:21:36.360
in the morning. And so I hereby end today's meeting at 3.52 p.m. and we will see you all

06:21:36.360 --> 06:21:43.480
tomorrow morning, closed session at 8.30 and public session starting between 8.45 and 9 o'clock.

06:21:43.480 --> 06:21:48.760
I want to thank staff for all the support, all the work to help us get to this point.

06:21:48.760 --> 06:21:57.000
So thank you all very much and I will see you in the morning.
