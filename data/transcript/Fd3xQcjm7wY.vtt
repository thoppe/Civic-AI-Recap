WEBVTT

00:04.921 --> 00:09.244
Okay, the board will convene and start with a salute to the flag.

00:12.587 --> 00:16.410
I salute to the flag of the United States of America.

00:27.571 --> 00:31.212
Okay, it's September and we have a new student board member.

00:31.452 --> 00:35.534
And so the first order of business is to swear her in.

00:36.454 --> 00:44.357
So our new board member, Hema Quetzal Cardenez, will please come forward and we'll administer the oath.

00:49.719 --> 00:52.040
Okay, please raise your right hand.

00:53.181 --> 00:54.301
Put that in your left hand.

00:55.081 --> 00:56.342
Okay.

00:57.152 --> 00:58.112
I, state your name.

00:58.492 --> 00:59.933
I, Gemma Quetzal Cardenas.

01:00.613 --> 01:01.753
Do solemnly swear.

01:01.773 --> 01:03.294
Do solemnly swear.

01:03.314 --> 01:06.415
That I will support and defend the Constitution.

01:06.715 --> 01:08.775
That I will support and defend the Constitution.

01:09.335 --> 01:10.536
Of the United States.

01:11.016 --> 01:11.836
Of the United States.

01:12.436 --> 01:15.057
Against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

01:15.517 --> 01:17.858
Against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

01:18.698 --> 01:20.739
That I will bear true faith and allegiance.

01:21.199 --> 01:23.079
That I will bear true faith and allegiance.

01:23.519 --> 01:25.620
To the Constitution of the United States.

01:25.919 --> 01:40.749
to the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which I am about to enter.

01:55.905 --> 01:57.305
and which I'm about to enter.

01:57.505 --> 01:58.405
Congratulations.

01:58.465 --> 02:05.227
You're a member of the State Board of Education.

02:05.387 --> 02:10.728
I think we'll pause for a photo.

02:10.748 --> 02:11.548
Would you like?

02:12.748 --> 02:12.968
Yeah.

02:21.029 --> 02:21.109
OK.

02:21.149 --> 02:21.409
Good.

02:21.489 --> 02:22.109
Thank you.

02:22.610 --> 02:22.930
Yeah.

02:23.010 --> 02:23.370
Thank you.

02:23.430 --> 02:24.250
I'll take that back.

02:25.971 --> 02:26.992
All right.

02:33.658 --> 02:34.238
OK, another.

02:36.280 --> 02:41.544
There's a nice fan club here from Oakland Unified, including Superintendent Kyla Johnson Trammell.

02:42.305 --> 02:46.028
So I know they're so proud of him.

03:42.310 --> 03:45.140
Okay, we are now ready for the report of the superintendent.

03:46.158 --> 03:47.679
Thank you, President Kerst and board members.

03:48.399 --> 03:49.920
And wasn't this a nice way to start a day?

03:50.720 --> 04:00.625
Just seeing Hema and her support team and teachers, mom, superintendent, all here to back you up and gives you hope, right?

04:00.645 --> 04:09.189
We're inspired when we see someone like you to be the student voice and an active leader now and in the future.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.190
So again, congratulations.

04:12.911 --> 04:13.991
First, we're back.

04:15.152 --> 04:16.272
Hope you all had great summers.

04:17.472 --> 04:21.434
Fairly smooth opening of school around the state.

04:23.774 --> 04:32.877
We want to let everyone know that schools are open despite the wildfire, widespread wildfire devastation in California.

04:33.740 --> 04:39.704
You remember last year we had at one time 650 schools closed and 300,000 students out of school.

04:40.665 --> 04:49.292
This fire has been bigger in many respects, the Carr fire and the Mendocino fire and others that have raged around the state.

04:50.052 --> 04:54.236
But thank goodness, not as much damage, but hundreds of homes have been lost.

04:54.396 --> 04:57.199
Students lost their homes, everything they had.

04:58.300 --> 05:05.006
Teachers, school board members, the devastation has been widespread.

05:05.726 --> 05:09.390
I want to give a special thanks to Shasta County Superintendent of Schools, Judy Flores.

05:10.150 --> 05:18.153
She and her team took my team, our facilities people, around to look at the devastation in August.

05:18.193 --> 05:28.316
And she ably led efforts to open the schools on time, made sure faculties are safe and serve students and their families, including those who lost their homes.

05:29.256 --> 05:35.098
We also had the tragic loss of lives, including four of our own firefighters.

05:38.260 --> 05:43.283
There is a new fire that just emerged closing down I-5 yesterday.

05:44.183 --> 05:51.408
So the students at Castle Rock Elementary had an unexpected overnight stay at the high school.

05:51.428 --> 05:54.530
They couldn't get back home because the I-5 was closed.

05:54.550 --> 05:56.031
The bus could not take them back home.

05:56.771 --> 06:04.257
So they slept over at I think it was Dunsmuir High School and they're safely back at home reunite with their parents today.

06:05.378 --> 06:10.341
I met terrific teachers and dedicated administrators all working together.

06:11.282 --> 06:13.344
They work non-stop to get the schools up and running.

06:13.364 --> 06:22.330
I was heartened to see humanity at its best with neighbors helping neighbors and schools collaborating to ensure students were able to attend their first day back.

06:23.932 --> 06:32.901
One example is a school named Ego Ono took in 60, 70 students from another school that couldn't get reopened.

06:32.941 --> 06:35.984
Shasta Elementary Union District couldn't reopen.

06:36.465 --> 06:43.131
So they just combined on one campus and they're working so well together again on behalf of the students.

06:43.932 --> 06:59.784
My CDE team comprised of Deborah Brown, Juan Morales, Marguerite Reese, and Leslie Taylor have been working closely with Judy and all the other county superintendents affected by the fires on the recovery and the cleanup and connecting them with resources for assisting in the recovery.

07:01.065 --> 07:05.749
Applying to FEMA and keeping records, applying for other aid for recovery.

07:06.389 --> 07:07.310
Last year, you recall,

07:09.232 --> 07:15.951
applied and received about $14 million including $2 million for mental health to deal with the trauma that these students and their teachers are going through.

07:17.212 --> 07:18.893
So that is underway.

07:20.034 --> 07:32.742
Just one note in the midst of it all, we visited one classroom where the firefighters had to chop their way through the roof to get in to see if there was fire going on in that particular wing of the school.

07:33.542 --> 07:39.586
And when you enter the classroom, it was dusty and smoky, but there was a big sign on the whiteboard, sorry.

07:40.774 --> 07:43.437
To leave such a mess, we had to save your school.

07:43.917 --> 07:46.460
So the firefighters from Butte County wrote a message.

07:47.739 --> 07:51.100
They were sorry to make a mess, but they had to save the school.

07:51.140 --> 07:58.983
And it's true that law enforcement and firefighters bravely worked together in the emergency to save lives and save schools.

08:01.064 --> 08:02.144
Computer science standards.

08:02.204 --> 08:08.786
Just later today, you're going to receive, this is a very happy day for all board members, especially Trish Williams.

08:08.926 --> 08:10.647
It's a good happy day for California.

08:11.348 --> 08:20.983
But the computer science standards following we have the legislature declaring September of this year as California Computer Science Education Month.

08:21.790 --> 08:34.838
And again, I want to congratulate all those who worked on the creation of the computer science standards for public schools, and in particular, CTE staff, Stephanie Grayson and Cliff Rednick and Renee Ostley Swank for their outstanding leadership.

08:35.258 --> 08:39.160
And of course, our superhero superstar here, Trish Williams, did an incredible job.

08:39.220 --> 08:45.284
So I know we're going to hear more and just your leadership and tenacity have been much appreciated.

08:45.304 --> 08:46.485
It's a milestone.

08:47.285 --> 08:49.806
Career technical education, just wanted to give a quick report.

08:49.826 --> 08:51.868
You'll get a more detailed report later today.

08:52.608 --> 08:59.672
You'll hear more about the progress that we're making with the California Workforce Pathways Joint Advisory Committee.

09:00.332 --> 09:08.856
This collaborative effort has worked to provide ongoing funding to create, expand, and improve our CTE programs, including the Strong Workforce Program.

09:10.197 --> 09:17.042
The 2018 budget appropriates $314 million in ongoing funding for K-12 career education.

09:17.782 --> 09:33.033
And I want to say we've seen great results around the state from the earlier investments in terms of graduation rates going up and student attendance and students' interest in staying in school when they do hands-on career tech kinds of courses and pathways.

09:33.673 --> 09:42.377
And I want to thank Donna Wyatt and her team, and you'll hear from them later today, for their leadership in bringing about these important milestones of progress.

09:43.257 --> 09:47.179
I created a Charter Schools Action Team over the last couple of months.

09:48.039 --> 09:54.442
In August, I pulled together leaders, thought leaders, involved experienced parties to help.

09:54.942 --> 09:55.883
This terrific team will

09:56.443 --> 10:05.186
review laws governing charter schools and provide advisory recommendations to the next state superintendent, governor, and state board of education and legislature.

10:06.266 --> 10:13.168
The California Charter School Act was enacted 26 years ago, but has had few changes or comprehensive review since then.

10:13.988 --> 10:22.551
Team members represent a variety of organizations and perspectives, including philanthropists, charter schools themselves, teachers, parents, and administrators.

10:23.332 --> 10:33.275
This team is being co-chaired by Action Team members Carl Cohn, our own former board member and CCEE leader, and Susan Bonilla, representing the Council for a Strong America.

10:33.996 --> 10:42.679
The Charter School Action Team will make recommendations in early December, and we welcome any input from any board member or any group that you're working with in that process.

10:43.459 --> 10:44.400
Healthy Kids Survey.

10:44.880 --> 10:50.704
I hope everyone will review the results of this year, the latest California Healthy Kids Survey.

10:50.724 --> 10:57.208
The CDE, our department, and the California Department of Health Care Services coordinated the statewide service.

10:58.488 --> 11:10.516
And as you know, the survey assesses how well schools are meeting students' needs for school safety, drug and alcohol prevention, mental health, and other factors that influence learning and positive development.

11:11.297 --> 11:16.478
The survey shows that alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use continues to decline among middle and high school students.

11:16.638 --> 11:17.419
That is good news.

11:18.019 --> 11:21.940
And improvements have occurred in pupil engagement, school climate, and mental health.

11:22.960 --> 11:29.902
In my last report to you, I shared with you the great need to secure funding to address the mental health needs of students throughout the state.

11:30.522 --> 11:32.823
Everything from depression to suicide, we have

11:33.623 --> 11:35.765
major needs and not enough services.

11:36.826 --> 11:45.913
I wanted to mention that the legislature passed four bills that are going to help us in suicide prevention and in getting more mental health dollars focused.

11:46.553 --> 11:59.703
And I formed a mental health task force which is working on an action plan to be ready by mid-November to be part to form a core for a legislative and budget package next year to invest more money in mental health.

12:00.243 --> 12:08.770
We have hundreds of millions of dollars of Prop 63 money that counties have been holding on to in reserve accounts and in interest accounts.

12:09.310 --> 12:22.821
And we're working with the Prop 63 Commission to free that money, to target that money and get it to work with the services and with the professional development training our teachers need to help students who have mental health needs.

12:24.810 --> 12:26.971
I'll only mention briefly, but point to your packet.

12:27.552 --> 12:36.557
Global 2030 is an initiative I started indicating, underscoring, emphasizing that it's important to know more than one language.

12:36.657 --> 12:42.781
And as you travel around the world, other countries, it's just standard to know two languages and often three.

12:43.381 --> 12:46.583
And so I have a column I wrote on the values of

12:46.983 --> 12:54.806
bilingual education, including everything from brain development to just being able to excel academically in all subjects.

12:55.626 --> 12:58.207
And that is in your packet.

12:59.167 --> 13:03.869
I just got back from China, where I was working with education officials there.

13:03.889 --> 13:07.730
We were wanting to create a dual immersion Mandarin program, a large one in California.

13:08.411 --> 13:21.385
And they were willing to recruit the teachers, help identify the teachers who would come here and be with us for a year or two or three years under certain visas to help with the Mandarin Dual Immersion programs.

13:22.647 --> 13:25.170
So the teacher exchange is exciting progress.

13:27.452 --> 13:28.653
We had a lot of updates, didn't we?

13:29.114 --> 13:36.522
It's been a long month, but I wanted to just say, again, congratulations to Hema, Cardenas, and all of us.

13:37.042 --> 13:38.444
We have some good work to do here together.

13:38.804 --> 13:39.385
Thank you very much.

13:41.149 --> 13:48.315
Okay, I wanted to start with giving the board members a little background on our new member, Hema Ketsalakardanes.

13:49.116 --> 13:58.224
She has been and is a senior at the Life Academy of Health and Bioscience in the Oakland Unified School District.

13:58.764 --> 14:03.769
And she has done a great deal in the Oakland Unified District in terms of different activities.

14:04.454 --> 14:09.597
She's been co-founder of the Life Academy Student Leadership since 2016.

14:10.377 --> 14:15.360
She's been an intern for the Student Engagement Office at the Oakland Unified School District.

14:16.821 --> 14:24.866
She has been Health and Wellness Director of the Oakland Unified School District All-City Council Student Union.

14:26.102 --> 14:29.803
and its vice president before that.

14:30.504 --> 14:42.788
And she's been a student representative on the Oakland School Board and a student representative for the Oakland Sanctuary District Task Force and ambassador for the Oakland Promise.

14:43.588 --> 14:45.929
So please welcome Hema to the board.

14:51.718 --> 14:51.898
Good.

14:51.918 --> 14:55.823
I have some other announcements before we begin with item one.

14:56.003 --> 15:05.714
The annual fall recruitment is underway for us on terms of our state board commissions for the 2019 and beyond.

15:06.415 --> 15:11.902
We need a student board member and so we need people to apply for that.

15:13.199 --> 15:18.102
We need the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools to replace some of those members.

15:18.702 --> 15:23.966
The California Practitioners Advisory Group, we also need to replace some of those members.

15:25.507 --> 15:30.530
We have three positions on the Instructional Quality Commission that we're seeking applications for.

15:31.290 --> 15:38.255
And we're also looking, as I indicated earlier, for the student board member as well.

15:39.568 --> 15:43.330
We have seven public hearings on our September agenda.

15:43.550 --> 15:47.013
Items four, five, and six will be heard this afternoon.

15:47.493 --> 15:52.056
And items 15, 16, 17, and 18 will be heard on Friday.

15:53.737 --> 15:59.140
We also then, I wanted to mention that we have consent calendars.

16:00.441 --> 16:04.683
And there's a handout on the table in the lobby listing the regular consent items.

16:04.723 --> 16:05.964
Those are items 11 through 14.

16:07.845 --> 16:13.727
We also have on consent at this point all our waiver items, waiver 1 through 17.

16:15.367 --> 16:23.470
Board members who wish to remove some of these from consent or waiver consent, please notify the executive director.

16:25.370 --> 16:29.792
And do that by 12 o'clock tomorrow, Thursday.

16:31.352 --> 16:32.573
We have... Pardon?

16:37.688 --> 16:39.589
Okay, 11 o'clock Thursday today.

16:39.610 --> 16:43.152
Yeah, I keep thinking Wednesday, you know, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

16:43.192 --> 16:44.573
I can't get used to this.

16:45.294 --> 16:54.501
Okay, I want to say that you have your electronic file, red file, and for letters from the outside.

16:55.982 --> 17:01.626
And we have an electronic agenda and one agenda of ours printed in lobby.

17:02.790 --> 17:09.113
If you want to give anything to the board and your member of the audience, provide at least 25 copies.

17:10.754 --> 17:21.419
And when you speak before the board, please introduce yourself and the organization or whoever you may represent yourself perhaps prior to speaking.

17:22.719 --> 17:38.529
We look for brevity and you need to recuse, board members need to recuse themselves if they must do so before any discussion on the item begins and we have some recusals.

17:39.850 --> 17:47.955
Okay, we're now ready for item one and this is a multi-pronged item that Cindy Gazanis will present.

17:48.735 --> 17:54.540
And so I'm going to ask the board for clarifying questions after each of the sub items.

17:55.261 --> 17:59.284
And then we'll have public comment on the whole batch of the items after that.

18:00.044 --> 18:02.206
So, Cindy, you may begin.

18:06.270 --> 18:09.392
Good morning, members of the board and welcome to our new student board member.

18:09.993 --> 18:11.074
My name is Cindy Kazanis.

18:11.154 --> 18:12.595
I'm the director of the assessment.

18:12.615 --> 18:13.796
Excuse me.

18:15.083 --> 18:16.404
Not the assessment.

18:17.665 --> 18:18.065
Whoa.

18:19.566 --> 18:20.587
I've already forgotten.

18:23.469 --> 18:28.512
Of our accountability division, it's a pleasure to speak with you today and to present this item.

18:28.652 --> 18:32.615
I will be joined at the podium by Jenny Singh to break up the item.

18:32.715 --> 18:33.916
It is a very long item.

18:33.996 --> 18:35.357
It's very technical in nature.

18:36.557 --> 18:37.718
So with that, I will

18:39.139 --> 18:44.802
Just wanted to introduce the attachments that will be covered in today's presentation.

18:46.082 --> 19:02.190
We will be talking first about the new measures for inclusion in the College Career Indicator, the proposed methodology for calculating chronic absenteeism indicator, proposed cut scores for our one-year graduation rate, and how to incorporate the five-year graduation rate into the dashboard for reporting purposes.

19:02.930 --> 19:06.872
And then you're going to get a preview of the redesigned California School Dashboard.

19:06.932 --> 19:16.277
So we're very excited for the conclusion of this presentation because we have been spending our summer working on this.

19:16.557 --> 19:17.737
I'm getting a little bit of echo.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.058
Do you hear that as well?

19:19.358 --> 19:19.678
OK.

19:24.201 --> 19:24.501
All right.

19:27.699 --> 19:44.910
So the recommendation for the item is that the department recommends that the State Board of Education approve, first, the inclusion of a state syllabi literacy, Golden State Seal merit diploma, and leadership military science, also known as the Reserve Officer Training Corps, or JROTC.

19:46.011 --> 19:47.712
as additional measures in the College Career Indicator.

19:48.232 --> 19:51.493
The second is the methodology for the Chronic Absenteeism Indicator.

19:51.914 --> 19:56.716
And the third, the proposed cut scores for the Dashboard Alternative School Status, one-year graduation rate.

19:57.156 --> 20:02.158
And finally, fourth, the reporting of the five-year graduation rate in the California School Dashboard.

20:04.757 --> 20:11.720
But before I go into the item, I just wanted to give you a preview of what's going to be on your plate for two months from now.

20:12.300 --> 20:22.923
So in November of 2018, you will be asked to look at several of the items because we now have the end of year data from all school districts.

20:23.003 --> 20:24.384
We've been working with it for about a week.

20:24.904 --> 20:36.915
So we will be very busy over the next two months as well to make sure that these items are ready for your review and that we get the appropriate stakeholder feedback for each of these pieces.

20:36.995 --> 20:40.218
So the academic indicator, we're going to bring back status and change cuts.

20:40.598 --> 20:44.061
Actually, for the first time, you're going to see status and change cut scores for grade 11.

20:45.342 --> 20:49.103
For college career indicator, you'll look at change cut scores for the first time and approve those.

20:49.703 --> 20:52.183
Chronic absenteeism, status and change cut scores.

20:52.303 --> 20:54.084
Again, this is the first time you'll be seeing those.

20:54.664 --> 21:05.186
And for graduation rate indicator, we're looking at revising the status cut scores for the four-year adjusted cohort and revised criteria for the one-year graduation rate for alternative schools.

21:05.506 --> 21:13.247
And in particular, I wanted to note publicly that the department intends to recommend an action that you approved in July

21:13.747 --> 21:17.409
that we actually take out one of the measures of the one-year graduation rate.

21:17.629 --> 21:33.017
We have been in contact through this entire process and we have worked very closely with our special education division and following your decision, additional concerns were brought to light about the validity and reliability on a statewide basis of this measure.

21:33.557 --> 21:42.482
So we are prepared to recommend in November, we want to make sure that we get stakeholder feedback on this of course, but the removal of that measure.

21:43.923 --> 21:54.130
Finally, we will be reviewing with you and asking for you to review rather and adopt criteria for determining LEA eligibility for differentiated assistance and intensive intervention.

21:54.550 --> 22:03.116
Specifically with the adoption of the college career indicator, we now need to end the adoption of the broad course of study local indicator for priority 7.

22:04.036 --> 22:05.898
There may be a need to remove that from priority 7.

22:06.218 --> 22:08.840
You had it as priority 7 and priority 8.

22:09.601 --> 22:15.882
So we will again be working over the next two months to get stakeholder feedback on each of these measures.

22:17.672 --> 22:27.859
I also wanted to mention something you don't see, but it actually involves quite a bit of staff time, is that bringing our alternative schools into the accountability system requires us to redo all of our programming.

22:28.060 --> 22:36.646
And we knew that was coming, but I just wanted to offer a bit of, you know, a bit of what it requires to put out this dashboard.

22:36.706 --> 22:43.711
So again, we've had this data approximately a week and we are all hands on deck to get a public release out for December.

22:47.668 --> 22:49.309
So we're going to start with attachment one.

22:50.290 --> 22:55.413
This is an indicator that you have seen now for the last two years.

22:56.153 --> 23:02.017
And the measures that you're seeing today are things that we have been talking about for, I would say, at least two years, if not longer.

23:03.157 --> 23:05.139
So I only provided you

23:05.999 --> 23:08.240
four bullets on things that you had seen previously.

23:08.320 --> 23:11.743
I think the list is actually longer than that, maybe closer to eight to ten.

23:12.523 --> 23:21.148
The College Career Indicator has been extensively discussed, whether it's through memos or through the item, the agenda item process.

23:21.809 --> 23:25.791
But of note, I would say in February 2018, we did do an extensive

23:28.004 --> 23:38.039
review of the timeline and also how to include additional measures and sort of looked at the validity and reliability of this indicator as well.

23:40.509 --> 23:44.670
And just a reminder, back in February, I think it's important to talk about what's the purpose.

23:44.930 --> 23:55.253
So the purpose of this indicator was to emphasize that a high school diploma represents the completion of a broad and rigorous course of study that prepares students for success after high school.

23:55.913 --> 23:57.293
We're looking at the four-year cohort.

23:57.533 --> 24:01.794
So we're looking at specific criteria that are relying on tests and course completion.

24:02.494 --> 24:05.435
Determine if a student is prepared, approaching prepared, and not prepared.

24:06.357 --> 24:19.450
We're also wanting to make sure that this measure, as you heard from San Juan Unified back in May, how they're doing to help use this data to prepare their students for success after high school.

24:19.710 --> 24:29.220
They told you back then that there were gaps, and so they are using this data to see how they can enhance their program to make sure that students are not only college but career ready.

24:32.955 --> 24:38.076
So the other thing I wanted to talk first about too is how this model is actually implemented.

24:38.556 --> 24:44.758
And keep in mind this is not, unlike other things that we're going to be talking about today, this is not on an individual student record.

24:44.938 --> 24:48.958
This is a reflection of a school and district's performance.

24:50.019 --> 24:55.900
So the information is not available at the student level, even though we talk about how students meet the prepared categories.

24:56.940 --> 25:00.522
We are restricted to data elements that we collect through our student level data system.

25:00.842 --> 25:05.804
So you'll see a slide in just a bit about what that exactly means.

25:06.445 --> 25:09.526
And then the measures we are using need to be evaluated.

25:09.906 --> 25:15.909
Our determination of validity and reliability and rigor is using the grade 11 summative assessment.

25:15.929 --> 25:21.872
So there's a very strong dependency on our assessments or measures in the College Career Indicator.

25:22.932 --> 25:36.495
And then I think finally, it's not the intent that every single high school in the state needs to implement all the measures that are listed in the College Career Indicator, but that credit rather should be given for the successful implementation of existing programs.

25:36.915 --> 25:47.197
And so as you saw in San Juan, they had strong programs in certain areas, in certain schools, and they're now looking district-wide to see how those could be replicated and make sure that, again, all students have access to

25:48.257 --> 25:48.998
to those programs.

25:50.258 --> 26:00.084
You have a copy of this, a color copy of this, in your basket, and this has of course been on the department's website now for about a year.

26:00.485 --> 26:05.208
This flyer is a one-page document that is also translated into Spanish.

26:05.768 --> 26:13.075
Probably our top other languages, I forget which ones get translated through everything, but this is definitely translated into Spanish.

26:13.635 --> 26:24.786
And this has been used to really describe, I think, just at a glance, how measures have come into the CCI.

26:26.127 --> 26:37.053
So if we start with prepared, and we look at those little logos on the left-hand side, the ones with the pencil and a bubble above it is using an assessment requirement.

26:37.413 --> 26:40.275
Those with a book is using a coursework requirement.

26:41.336 --> 26:46.318
The top four items are items that we consider to be standalone items.

26:46.819 --> 26:50.681
The final two, which are A through G requirements and career technical pathway,

26:51.121 --> 26:54.525
need to have an additional criteria and that's the white box below.

26:55.086 --> 27:05.358
So the measures that have been included for Sandiland measures are of course the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment, Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and Completion of Dual Enrollment.

27:05.778 --> 27:07.260
The last three are of course

27:08.901 --> 27:20.583
vetted out those, especially the AP exams and the IB exams are things that are vetted through a full valid and reliability process system by, of course, these external organizations.

27:22.364 --> 27:29.405
The completion of dual enrollment as well, you know, they're looking at something that is considered college level course.

27:29.465 --> 27:34.906
So with IB and AP, you can potentially get college credit for those courses as well.

27:35.928 --> 27:48.513
So what the College Career Indicator is really meant to do is to show the cumulative achievement over a four-year period of a student's and then what a school is offering.

27:48.613 --> 27:51.754
It's meant to demonstrate, again, a rigorous and broad course of study.

27:55.250 --> 28:02.695
This is information that has been included in not only the agenda item, but the information memorandum.

28:02.815 --> 28:08.139
And for me, I felt like it was a little easier to see it in a visual format.

28:08.579 --> 28:13.883
So what you can see is that we have four measures that were proposed.

28:14.323 --> 28:17.986
One measure we're actually recommending not including, that is the last measure.

28:18.306 --> 28:21.048
But the first three measures I'm gonna talk about in depth.

28:21.628 --> 28:34.677
And I think it's important to note that while, for example, the state syllabi literacy was implemented, I think, back in 2012, we only began collecting data in 2017 at the student level.

28:35.498 --> 28:41.943
And what we collect for that data, as well as Golden State Merit Diploma, as well as A through G, is simply did you complete

28:42.563 --> 28:43.184
the requirements.

28:43.464 --> 28:47.668
We don't ask you how you completed the requirements, we simply ask you if you completed the requirements.

28:48.088 --> 28:59.840
So we don't have the ability to dig into the records to see, you know, did the student do each of the course requirements for this Golden State SEAL and pass with the particular grade.

29:00.280 --> 29:05.145
So there is room for, you know, interpretation at the local level and

29:06.566 --> 29:10.989
potential error, and you're going to see that in some of the slides, but that is the limitation.

29:11.149 --> 29:22.855
So we're doing the best we can with this data, and I have to tell you in order to get that state bill, syllabi literacy into this system, it was actually, you know, we had competing interests at that time.

29:23.195 --> 29:29.439
So to get just a yes or no programmed into the statewide data system is actually quite a big deal.

29:30.539 --> 29:42.804
And we are so excited to have not only that, but the merit diploma collected and available at the student level for us to use for this purpose, looking at the college career indicator and how it can be incorporated.

29:43.665 --> 29:48.767
For the leadership military science, this is something that has been brought up time and time again with the CCI work group.

29:51.128 --> 30:00.255
We've been collecting this data actually for quite a bit of time and member Holliday brought up that we were calling it ROTC and at the high school level it's actually JROTC.

30:00.535 --> 30:06.100
So we've tried to correct that where we can but in the recommendation the error remains.

30:07.501 --> 30:16.848
And that just as similar to the articulated career technical education courses, those are done through the course section completion records in CALPADS.

30:21.112 --> 30:33.479
So just as a reminder, how we conduct our analysis to make sure that these measures meet the validity and the reliability test is we're looking against Smarter Balanced summative assessments.

30:34.280 --> 30:42.625
We use that to help us inform and place measurements across the three college career indicator levels, prepared, approaching prepared, and not prepared.

30:43.825 --> 30:52.748
And so as an example, we're looking at how do the students who earn the state syllabi literacy perform on the summative assessments versus those who did not earn the state syllabi literacy.

30:52.828 --> 30:58.290
So we always get that comparison and that's what you've asked us to do to make sure that we've done a thorough analysis.

31:00.740 --> 31:12.309
So as an overview for each of the measures, the first column you can see the measure name, and then you can see the number of students who were awarded the measure, those that did not in the cohort, and then what the total cohort size was.

31:12.389 --> 31:15.551
Of course, it's the same for all the measures, the total cohort size.

31:15.992 --> 31:23.117
But you can see far and beyond is that the largest amount of student group that, or rather the largest

31:24.438 --> 31:29.226
population of students who earned one of these measures was the Golden State Seal, which is almost 20%, 19.4%.

31:31.589 --> 31:38.480
The next were the articulated course and then followed by the syllabi literacy and then the smallest with our JROTC.

31:42.898 --> 31:51.646
So I'm going to move into the first piece, and I believe after I present this piece, I can pause for technical questions.

31:52.907 --> 32:02.937
So the syllabi literacy is offered to students who demonstrate proficiency in speaking, reading, and writing in at least one or more languages in addition to English.

32:03.277 --> 32:06.981
There are some minimum requirements in terms of this.

32:07.501 --> 32:12.884
the SBAC summative, which I will describe as we get through the next slides.

32:13.364 --> 32:17.446
We are proposing that this measure be for both career and college.

32:17.786 --> 32:37.056
And of course, recalling our conversation about two years ago, when you asked us to remove the well-prepared category because we didn't have enough career measures, I think it's really important to point out in each of these elements that we're adding, which of them are career and college and which of them are either college as a standalone or career as a standalone.

32:40.839 --> 32:50.101
So the red box here on the right hand side are the current requirements, rather the requirements under the state syllabi literacy that students must meet.

32:50.582 --> 32:57.663
So the students must score at least standard met on the grade 11 summative assessment in English language arts.

32:58.203 --> 33:07.866
So you see there are students that were also in the categories of earning the state syllabi literacy that had standard not met and standard nearly met.

33:08.366 --> 33:15.230
You can also see as a comparison, as I mentioned, this is our data analysis, we're comparing against those that did not earn a state syllabi literacy.

33:15.630 --> 33:25.116
So you definitely have stronger performance by those that have earned a state syllabi literacy in assessments overall for English language arts.

33:27.486 --> 33:30.530
This next slide is the mathematics piece.

33:30.870 --> 33:44.208
So while there is not a requirement in the state syllabi literacy, the proposal today is that students must receive at least math on the math portion of the summative assessment standard nearly met.

33:45.609 --> 34:02.005
But looking at it, again, compared to students who earned the state syllabi literacy versus those that did not, you still see stronger, especially in those two latter categories, standard met and standard exceeded, students that have earned the state syllabi literacy doing far better than their peers.

34:02.466 --> 34:04.428
I think that's really important to note.

34:10.362 --> 34:17.327
So just briefly just to mention, there were some students who earned a state syllabi literacy.

34:18.588 --> 34:22.492
They were, as we mentioned on the previous slide, they needed to score at least standard met.

34:22.552 --> 34:25.374
We saw it roughly a little over

34:27.215 --> 34:33.497
close to 2,000 students who earned a state syllabi literacy that did not meet that minimum threshold for the Smarter Balanced standard met.

34:33.597 --> 34:37.859
So those are schools and districts that we will follow up with to remind them of the criteria.

34:37.899 --> 34:46.522
But again, we only collect yes or no for each of those students on whether or not they met the requirements of the state syllabi literacy.

34:46.542 --> 34:52.685
There are actually four different requirements that you have to meet in order to receive the state syllabi literacy.

34:53.645 --> 35:01.053
We also see that the state syllabus was awarded to students who earned, as I just mentioned, standard nearly met and standard not met.

35:01.434 --> 35:04.717
And then finally, we did have a small number of students who did not test at all.

35:04.997 --> 35:07.360
So those were removed from the cohort.

35:11.704 --> 35:25.555
So this is the proposal that we are recommending to you today, that in order to be in the prepared level, the student that earns a state sealed by literacy should, of course, score at least the standard met on English language arts.

35:26.075 --> 35:30.719
And then we're proposing additional criteria that they score at least standard nearly met on mathematics.

35:31.460 --> 35:34.182
This would result in 35,982 students in the class of 2017 meeting the criteria.

35:38.525 --> 35:46.352
This would also represent of those who earned the state syllabi literacy, 86% of those students would be considered at the prepared level.

35:47.193 --> 35:54.820
We also received feedback actually at the California Practitioners Advisory Group that we should think about adding approaching prepared level.

35:55.260 --> 36:03.107
So the suggestion was to remove the mathematics requirement and simply leave it as is with the

36:04.509 --> 36:13.397
just the standard amount on English language arts, which is of course a requirement of the state seal of biliteracy.

36:14.838 --> 36:25.929
The stakeholders that we obviously had a lot of stakeholder input on this issue over the last several months, first with the College Career Indicator Workgroup who met in May and

36:29.251 --> 36:32.592
felt strongly about the prepared level and what you see today as the recommendation.

36:33.293 --> 36:37.034
This was discussed at length with the California Practitioners Advisory Group.

36:37.574 --> 36:40.255
And as I mentioned, they had the suggestion about approaching prepared.

36:40.835 --> 36:45.436
There was one member on the dais who did not agree with the mathematics requirement.

36:45.476 --> 36:47.857
So that was expressed as well.

36:47.997 --> 36:56.200
And then we did run this by the Technical Advisory Group who concurred with the recommendation and then finally shared it with the LCFF Stakeholder Work Group.

36:56.900 --> 36:59.482
who is made up of education and equity advocates.

36:59.742 --> 37:05.085
And there wasn't a lot of discussion about this particular issue at that meeting.

37:05.746 --> 37:09.928
So with that, I'm happy to turn it over to President Kirst for technical questions on this measure.

37:11.449 --> 37:13.050
Well, thank you for that description.

37:13.431 --> 37:17.593
Board member questions on this at this point?

37:18.374 --> 37:23.037
Board member Bruce, go ahead.

37:24.975 --> 37:27.202
for holiday thanks mike

37:32.897 --> 37:40.219
Thanks for correcting the JROTC, although I think it was in one of the first slides you have here, you still had ROTC instead of JROTC.

37:40.239 --> 37:44.100
I think it was in the recommendation, yeah.

37:44.380 --> 37:58.283
I'm a fan of having this be a part of the College and Career Readiness Indicator, but there are a number of different flavors of leadership military science that exist in the state of California in different schools right now.

37:59.143 --> 38:05.486
And if this is... Are you going to talk about this later?

38:05.506 --> 38:06.626
Oh, I'm sorry.

38:06.706 --> 38:07.967
We're doing biliteracy first.

38:08.027 --> 38:08.787
I'm sorry.

38:08.967 --> 38:09.827
I apologize.

38:09.907 --> 38:12.328
I do have data for the JROTC.

38:13.809 --> 38:17.350
Each of these are so complex in themselves that... I'm sorry.

38:17.450 --> 38:18.711
I jumped the gun.

38:18.771 --> 38:19.591
I hear you.

38:19.891 --> 38:20.332
I'll be back.

38:20.552 --> 38:20.792
Okay.

38:21.612 --> 38:22.032
I'm ready.

38:24.133 --> 38:24.473
Okay.

38:24.833 --> 38:26.094
Board Member Ortiz-Lacombe.

38:27.568 --> 38:27.948
Thank you.

38:28.909 --> 38:30.031
I agree with CPAC.

38:30.291 --> 38:33.955
I don't understand why we're adding mathematics to the syllabi literacy.

38:34.455 --> 38:43.285
When you mentioned the criteria, there was one bullet point, but there is actually, unless I'm mistaken, there is a GPA requirement to earn the syllabi literacy.

38:43.605 --> 38:47.049
There is multiple criteria already that must be met.

38:47.495 --> 39:08.341
And so I was reading a letter from LPI and I want to read, if I could find it, I want to read one of their quotes from their letter where it urges us to really think about the application of mathematics in a more consistent way across the CCI indicators so that we don't signal out a particular racial or linguistic group.

39:08.781 --> 39:18.143
And I am scared that we are moving in that direction by adding an added layer of rigor to this indicator of the CCI versus others.

39:19.023 --> 39:28.405
If we want to move later to well prepared, I think that would maybe an appropriate time, but it would also have to be consistent because it hasn't been consistent the use of mathematics.

39:29.145 --> 39:31.386
So I would agree with CPAC that we should remove it.

39:33.107 --> 39:35.269
Can you comment on the consistent point?

39:35.449 --> 39:39.352
I mean, we've had an additional requirement for other indicators.

39:39.412 --> 39:46.037
So I'd like you to clarify that and that this is not something that is required to get the seal of bioliteracy per se.

39:46.809 --> 39:47.750
Sure.

39:49.511 --> 39:56.856
Now that you've indicated that there are other criteria, the slide was getting very word heavy.

39:56.976 --> 40:05.982
So there is a handout that we provided to the California Petitions Advisory Group, but I know that we've referenced this criteria before.

40:06.862 --> 40:09.343
just so everybody's on the same page when I read it out loud.

40:10.103 --> 40:17.606
The student must demonstrate completion of all English language arts requirements for graduation with an overall grade point average of 2.0 in those classes.

40:18.786 --> 40:31.091
Passing this California assessment of student performance and progress for English language arts or any successor test administrated in grade 11 at or above the standard met achievement level or the achievement level determined by the superintendent for any successor test.

40:32.418 --> 40:37.881
Third, proficiency in one of our languages other than English demonstrated through one of the following methods.

40:38.401 --> 40:46.006
A, passing a foreign language advanced placement examination with a score of three or higher or an international baccalaureate examination with a score of four or more.

40:46.646 --> 40:54.791
B, successful completion of a four-year high school course of study in a foreign language attaining an overall grade point average of 3.0 or higher in that course of study.

40:56.452 --> 41:01.116
and demonstrating oral proficiency in a language comparable to that which is required to pass an AP or IB.

41:01.596 --> 41:04.638
C, passing a district test with a score of proficient or higher.

41:04.658 --> 41:08.181
This is, again, if no AP examination off the shelf exists.

41:08.781 --> 41:13.585
And then D, passing the SAT II foreign language exam with a score of 600 or higher.

41:15.106 --> 41:30.991
And finally, in addition to the requirements mentioned above, if the primary language of a pupil is other than English, he or she shall demonstrate English language, English proficiency on the ELPAC, the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California or any successor assessment.

41:31.671 --> 41:35.432
And to go back to, again, the data analysis, I would

41:36.973 --> 41:43.862
Probably the best slide to walk through this, unfortunately, is this one, which is somewhat hard to read.

41:45.204 --> 41:49.970
Looking at what we have considered standalone in the past in terms of prepared.

41:52.413 --> 42:00.263
The items that are standalone are Smarter Violence Assessments with a score of 3 or higher on both ELA and Mathematics.

42:01.064 --> 42:04.448
Advanced Placement with a score of 3 or higher on two AP exams.

42:05.009 --> 42:11.177
And while we don't specify in the AP exams or the IB exams that it needs to be in Mathematics or English Language Arts,

42:12.979 --> 42:22.111
We definitely made a conscientious decision and ran this by the technical advisory group and stakeholders that we weren't going to allow just one exam to indicate that you were prepared.

42:22.171 --> 42:22.972
It needed to be two.

42:23.032 --> 42:28.139
That was the threshold that we had evaluated that we felt met the rigor.

42:28.939 --> 42:31.900
And then finally, the dual enrollment piece.

42:32.461 --> 42:37.003
So again, you're looking at that higher level of preparing students for college and career.

42:37.223 --> 42:51.650
And I empathize with the point that is being made, but if we're recommending this for college and career, you need to at least have a minimum amount of math knowledge to be eligible to go to college.

42:52.590 --> 42:54.532
or to be successful in college, I would say.

42:55.373 --> 43:03.141
So scoring a level two on the mathematics exam is the way that we have suggested that the board move.

43:03.861 --> 43:12.510
And with 86% of the students who've earned the SEAL being eligible with that criteria, that's how we came up with our recommendation.

43:13.476 --> 43:17.798
Yeah, but we're not singling out this measure for, you know, an additional thing.

43:17.918 --> 43:20.480
It's woven throughout the other measures.

43:20.600 --> 43:21.080
That's correct.

43:21.120 --> 43:21.961
So, you're right.

43:22.041 --> 43:28.344
Some view that we're, you know, picking this measure and putting extra things on that aren't on other measures.

43:28.584 --> 43:31.907
Well, so I think I should have followed up with the last two pieces.

43:32.087 --> 43:39.733
That is a great point, because the A through G requirements we know from multiple studies that just by completing those alone doesn't mean you're going to be successful in college.

43:39.773 --> 43:47.700
In fact, a large number of students need to take remedial education, as we know from Professor Kurlander's work.

43:48.080 --> 43:51.943
So we have said that that cannot be a standalone measure to show you're prepared.

43:52.584 --> 43:54.225
They need to show additional criteria.

43:54.305 --> 43:57.488
So additional criteria are one of three options.

43:57.948 --> 44:06.249
again, looking at Smarter Balance results, looking at whether or not they've completed dual enrollment, and then finally, if they scored the three or higher on the AP.

44:06.570 --> 44:11.370
The other measure that I would consider it to be similar to is the Career Technical Education Pathway.

44:11.790 --> 44:17.491
And again, as a standalone, we didn't feel that it was appropriate, wasn't rigorous enough, and needed that additional criteria.

44:17.591 --> 44:26.453
So this meets the same, where I would say this follows into the same requirements as the A through G requirements and the CTE requirements.

44:28.387 --> 44:28.607
Okay.

44:29.468 --> 44:30.288
Board member Rucker.

44:32.349 --> 44:43.075
So, let me begin by saying I have some concerns about this requirement as it relates to specifically the state seal of biliteracy.

44:43.715 --> 44:49.919
I was at the CPAG meeting and I was at, if my memory serves, I believe I was the only board member

44:50.439 --> 44:52.240
who was present for that.

44:53.041 --> 44:55.563
Oh, okay.

44:55.583 --> 45:00.246
So I'm concerned that, I'm concerned because I'm a little confused.

45:00.846 --> 45:07.030
While this is, the CCI is in the architecture of what I thought we were putting together.

45:07.791 --> 45:20.099
This was supposed to give us a composite picture of what LEAs are doing across the spectrum of their programs, both academic and career programs.

45:20.559 --> 45:33.408
to offer access to students to create this definition of readiness for college or to enter the workforce when they leave these high schools.

45:33.989 --> 45:45.197
And so these metrics, however, are beginning to take on an outsized impact on defining that has an impact on students individually.

45:45.717 --> 46:06.382
The change that's being proposed in particular on this state seal of biliteracy is going to have an impact on students who will graduate next spring who made a multi-year commitment when they entered high school to do the work and be on the pathway to earn this certification.

46:07.282 --> 46:22.926
adding this criteria or looking at this criteria in the aggregate, which is what you want us to consider, changes what this, what attaining this state syllabi literacy will mean in particular for the students who are going to graduate in the spring because

46:23.366 --> 46:24.927
They started with that program.

46:24.967 --> 46:34.531
They contracted with their high schools and their counselors for what work they had to do to complete this program based on what they understood this criteria would mean.

46:34.891 --> 46:36.572
And suddenly, they won't count.

46:36.952 --> 46:39.793
And none of the work that they have done is going to count.

46:40.353 --> 46:45.436
If we're taught, I think that there's two things that are operating at cross purposes here.

46:45.956 --> 47:08.267
What our definition and intent is and defining by literacy and recognizing that accomplishment for students and what we are trying to do in monitoring and reporting what districts are doing and creating access for college and career readiness in the course of study and the access in the master schedule that students should have.

47:08.647 --> 47:15.910
And I think that there's a conflict here that's occurring, particularly for this upcoming graduating class, that's unanticipated.

47:16.290 --> 47:30.215
We see that difference in the statistics you've already given us in this chart in showing that there were districts who made a local decision to award the state seal based on far more narrower criteria focused solely on

47:30.735 --> 47:35.639
English language literacy and not necessarily considering the math.

47:35.999 --> 47:47.128
So I have a concern that even though it's a small number, as you point out, of students who would not be considered and would not be awarded and would not be reported.

47:47.709 --> 47:57.917
I just need to say, even if it's just one for that one student, that's an important and significant change that tells them what they've done for their high school career,

47:58.537 --> 48:03.883
really and truly didn't amount to what was promised to them.

48:04.203 --> 48:06.045
So there has to be something done.

48:06.065 --> 48:11.290
I don't believe this conflict is going to go away for this single year because of this single year.

48:11.670 --> 48:21.140
I believe that's a conflict we're going to have in looking at the application of this criteria for these two very distinct elements from year to year going forward.

48:21.440 --> 48:28.905
But it is very clear and very apparent for this year that is definitely going to happen to this graduating cohort.

48:29.185 --> 48:33.889
And I think we need to hold ourselves accountable for what that's going to mean.

48:34.009 --> 48:42.194
Again, I'm wondering if we're confusing what the individual student gets with a career and college indicator.

48:42.335 --> 48:46.317
And I don't think we're affecting at all what the individual student gets.

48:48.079 --> 48:49.240
Maybe you can answer it.

48:49.280 --> 48:51.223
Maybe board members can clarify it.

48:51.283 --> 48:59.593
But this has been bedeviled this argument all along that we're confusing students with an indicator.

49:00.094 --> 49:06.437
So there are no additional elements being added to the state Zillow bi-literacy.

49:06.617 --> 49:07.297
I understand that.

49:07.337 --> 49:24.585
What we are suggesting is in order to demonstrate that a student, for the purposes of being in the accountability system, which of course is a reflection of the school and the district, non-individual student, is that there is a demonstration of scoring at least a level two on the mathematics piece of the SBAC.

49:26.966 --> 49:28.067
Okay, so let me be clear.

49:28.667 --> 49:40.353
I am not confused about the difference between how a student or the criteria for how a student would earn the state seal and what it is an LEA reports.

49:41.133 --> 49:48.517
What I am saying is that because there is a difference, there's this added criteria for what the LEA reports.

49:49.158 --> 49:53.640
I am saying it's going to inform the decisions the LEA makes

49:54.040 --> 49:57.783
in their individual relationship with those individual students.

49:58.283 --> 50:10.192
That is a conflict that we are going, I'm saying that there is a clear conflict between the accountability requirements for reporting and what LEAs are supposed to be making sure they appropriately counsel their students to do.

50:10.712 --> 50:19.978
What I am saying is that we need to hold ourselves accountable for making sure that difference is not something students end up being penalized for.

50:20.419 --> 50:23.241
I'm not confused about what the requirements are.

50:23.761 --> 50:36.993
I am saying there are a lot of people who are in charge of education who don't read and follow those same directions and we need to be careful about that because I am certain there will be students who will be affected if we're not clear.

50:38.595 --> 50:39.856
Board Member Strauss is next.

50:39.916 --> 50:46.901
So first, Cindy, I want to thank you and your team that has been working so hard on the analysis.

50:46.961 --> 50:50.284
And I know that we have a lot of details that we still need to flesh out.

50:50.644 --> 50:57.069
And first, I want to say, I think this chart is actually more helpful with the assessment and coursework code.

50:57.109 --> 51:00.031
That was kind of a nice piece that you guys added there anyway.

51:00.111 --> 51:07.096
So just appreciate that and look forward to working more on the column that we have not

51:07.831 --> 51:09.211
added yet in the future.

51:09.492 --> 51:12.172
So with that, I want to talk about the seal of biliteracy.

51:12.312 --> 51:17.994
And I appreciate you sharing with us all the requirements for getting the seal.

51:18.034 --> 51:22.396
And my understanding is if students do all those things that you read, they will get the seal.

51:22.936 --> 51:25.937
My question is, where did we decide?

51:26.297 --> 51:30.358
Was it staff that decided to add a math requirement in order

51:30.858 --> 51:32.819
for it to be included in CCI.

51:32.839 --> 51:34.660
So that's one question.

51:35.000 --> 51:39.322
And two, let me just say, I do think math skills going forward is a lifelong skill.

51:39.362 --> 51:47.366
We know it's a gateway and a gatekeeper to future success, college completion, income for your life, all kinds of things.

51:47.426 --> 51:53.109
So I'm totally supportive of us needing to want students to be at least approaching preparatory math.

51:53.149 --> 51:58.072
But I just wonder, where was the decision made to propose putting math

51:59.267 --> 52:03.430
added to CL by Literacy in order to get counted in the CCI?

52:03.450 --> 52:04.971
That's my first question.

52:04.991 --> 52:07.912
I have a few more, so I'm not... Do you want to take them one at a time?

52:08.253 --> 52:10.194
Yeah, do that part first.

52:11.315 --> 52:14.296
So that decision was made by the CCI work group.

52:14.637 --> 52:23.182
They felt very strongly that math was an important indicator for success after high school, so they added that criteria in.

52:23.542 --> 52:25.523
So Jenny, just thank you for clearing that.

52:25.764 --> 52:34.830
But we didn't add that for other, like, so if you get an A to G, did we say you also have to be approaching prepared in math?

52:34.910 --> 52:41.054
Is math, so where else is math added into other indicators that go into CCI?

52:41.114 --> 52:42.114
Let's clarify that.

52:42.355 --> 52:48.799
So it is added in A through G and it's added in through the CTE pathway completers.

52:49.119 --> 52:59.061
So in the CTE, A to G, and bilingual literacy, you're recommending that they have to have at least approaching prepared in order to be counted as college and career ready.

52:59.242 --> 52:59.562
Correct.

52:59.762 --> 53:00.002
Okay.

53:00.062 --> 53:11.264
And then the feedback from CPAG, and I do have on my notes and I was there for that discussion, there was some concern and some, not a hundred percent, but some requests to pull it out.

53:11.425 --> 53:17.146
So how did you all decide to take, that's our advisory commission on accountability.

53:17.546 --> 53:24.071
We have a really committed group of people, five superintendents, county and school district teachers, leaders, principals.

53:24.151 --> 53:26.752
It's a wonderful group of people who really are committed.

53:27.233 --> 53:30.555
How did we decide to discount that pushback?

53:31.295 --> 53:32.857
We did not discount the pushback.

53:32.937 --> 53:34.237
Let me state that very clearly.

53:34.438 --> 53:37.760
We took their advice to heart.

53:38.160 --> 53:42.123
We revisited the fact that we didn't have a proposal prepared and added that.

53:42.603 --> 53:45.045
I will say one thing about the California Practitioners Advisory Group.

53:45.105 --> 53:46.606
They do not vote on any matters.

53:47.126 --> 53:48.668
That's right.

53:48.708 --> 53:49.349
There is no vote.

53:49.389 --> 53:51.891
There is simply a sharing out of individual members.

53:51.991 --> 54:00.680
So we are never able to say with confidence that the CPAG as a whole said this because it is made up of individual members who have individual opinions.

54:00.901 --> 54:03.864
There's not been a vote to my knowledge since it was incorporated.

54:04.364 --> 54:12.169
We also talked to staff internally and with state board staff and ultimately this is a recommendation from the superintendent to the board.

54:12.729 --> 54:17.953
I'm sure they're, you know, ultimately it's a policy decision from this board about how you want to proceed.

54:17.993 --> 54:20.815
This is a very complex indicator.

54:21.155 --> 54:27.439
There are multiple ways to arrive at prepared and I understand Member Rucker's point about unintended consequences and

54:28.299 --> 54:31.482
We are seeing that with other measures in the accountability system.

54:31.802 --> 54:36.005
If it's not in there or if it doesn't exist, then it doesn't count.

54:36.165 --> 54:38.707
Or maybe it's pushing policy in a different direction.

54:38.727 --> 54:41.089
That's not the purpose of the accountability system.

54:41.109 --> 54:48.715
It's to talk about what is currently happening in the system and show where things are doing really well and show where there are improvements that are needed.

54:48.795 --> 54:52.578
And so we are getting to the point where at maturity in which the tension is now

54:53.138 --> 54:53.738
been building.

54:54.359 --> 54:59.662
And in this particular measure, I know that this has been very difficult to proceed with.

55:00.422 --> 55:05.825
There's a lot of decision points and this is now going to be high stakes with a color added this fall.

55:06.185 --> 55:12.789
So my understanding, first of all, I appreciate you reading all the things a student has to do to get the seal of biliteracy.

55:13.209 --> 55:16.471
It's an important life skill, as Superintendent Torlakson said in his

55:17.171 --> 55:27.655
opening comments, and I think those of us who recognize the diversity of California and the world recognize what that takes and also that what a great preparation for life going forward.

55:28.015 --> 55:31.776
That being said, my understanding from your chart on your slide was

55:32.276 --> 55:37.458
that of the students who do all of those criteria, they get the seal of biliteracy.

55:37.938 --> 55:56.805
And those that are now going to be excluded from under this proposal for the college and career indicator would be 9.7 percent, am I right, of students who earn the seal of biliteracy, but did not meet at least nearly met in math, would then that those students and then those

55:57.825 --> 56:02.970
those LEAs would not get credit for almost 10% of the kids who got the sealed by literacy.

56:03.030 --> 56:05.273
They wouldn't be considered college and career.

56:05.593 --> 56:08.055
They wouldn't get credit for that under this proposal.

56:08.176 --> 56:09.617
Is that the way I understand it?

56:09.817 --> 56:15.103
It would not meet the prepared category as it is currently recommended in this proposal so that

56:16.963 --> 56:17.804
That's correct.

56:18.385 --> 56:24.551
But they would be reported as approaching prepared if that is the only measure that they meet.

56:24.631 --> 56:28.195
You know, we see overall these students are doing quite well.

56:28.796 --> 56:31.639
It is likely that they would meet another measure as prepared.

56:33.241 --> 56:33.781
Who's next?

56:34.602 --> 56:35.363
Board Member Sung.

56:37.557 --> 56:51.385
So I'm going to have a kind of a opposite conversation regarding the state's sealed merit diploma for the next item.

56:51.465 --> 57:02.291
But what I wanted to talk a little bit about is just what I'm hearing from the conversation is that we have some holes in the architecture of the CCI.

57:03.171 --> 57:09.254
And we need some clarification here because originally we said this was a college and career indicator.

57:09.714 --> 57:12.655
Then I've heard that it's college or career.

57:13.456 --> 57:15.656
So the measures that go in are college or career.

57:15.676 --> 57:21.939
And then this particular measure that you're proposing is college and career.

57:21.959 --> 57:27.842
So I can see the argument for adding the academic pieces of it.

57:29.102 --> 57:38.690
perhaps, but then when we're looking at some other measures, we're not adding, as in the Golden Seal state merit, we're not adding additional criteria.

57:38.971 --> 57:45.316
And I feel the criteria for Golden State Seal is much lower than the criteria for getting a

57:46.437 --> 57:47.438
seal it by literacy.

57:47.978 --> 57:53.963
So I'm not quite sure how some of the decisions and some of the recommendations are coming in.

57:55.324 --> 58:00.427
So I do have concerns about how we're defining this indicator.

58:00.527 --> 58:01.968
Is it college and career?

58:02.168 --> 58:05.551
Is it this amalgamation?

58:05.851 --> 58:08.873
And the pieces that go in there, does that make any sense?

58:09.354 --> 58:11.415
And then the other concern that I have,

58:13.016 --> 58:15.978
is around our data collection overall.

58:16.158 --> 58:24.403
We've got current measures in this indicator that we haven't fully flushed out yet.

58:24.563 --> 58:28.125
And like an example is the completion of dual enrollment.

58:28.625 --> 58:39.874
right now to get that information into CALPADS is extremely technically difficult for us to do and we haven't collected that data well enough to be included in here.

58:39.934 --> 58:50.081
So we've got a lot of work on each of these measures and the quality of these measures, what goes in, looking at the validity and reliability.

58:50.101 --> 58:56.806
I'm afraid that if we keep adding these things, adding these measures into this indicator and

58:58.648 --> 59:04.013
what we put in isn't really clean, it's going to just be a bunch of noise.

59:04.313 --> 59:09.678
It's just not really going to give us the information that we really need on an accountability system.

59:10.058 --> 59:12.120
So that's my kind of overall piece of it.

59:12.160 --> 59:15.743
And as we talk about these individual measures, we're considering to add into it

59:16.764 --> 59:23.786
I want to make sure that we're very clear on what we're doing before we approve to get these in because we're going to be working.

59:23.966 --> 59:27.627
When we add the well-prepared, we're just going to be working on sand.

59:28.227 --> 59:33.409
So I feel like we need to get some of these measures that we've got in there already more solid.

59:36.410 --> 59:37.830
Okay, next.

59:37.990 --> 59:40.431
Board Member Valdez.

59:42.578 --> 59:52.282
So first of all, thank you for the work that you're doing and I love infographics and these kinds of things and then the additional criteria key really is very, very helpful.

59:52.302 --> 59:53.162
So I thank you for that.

59:53.962 --> 59:54.523
A couple things.

59:54.603 --> 01:00:01.225
I agree with board member Ting when she talks about the and or the or and the rigor or the expectation.

01:00:01.846 --> 01:00:04.587
If math is important, I feel like it should transcend all of them.

01:00:05.427 --> 01:00:06.088
not some of them.

01:00:07.048 --> 01:00:15.455
If we look at, for example, dual enrollment, you could have a child who doesn't take a math course for dual enrollment.

01:00:15.475 --> 01:00:24.201
They could take English and they could take History, and they would never take a math, but yet they're meeting, and I think as I'm reading it, prepared is just one thing on there.

01:00:24.221 --> 01:00:26.683
It would be considered prepared.

01:00:27.103 --> 01:00:34.069
So, I just have a concern that we're asking rigor on one item and we're not asking it for the others.

01:00:34.290 --> 01:00:38.553
So, I think we should be all in or and not.

01:00:38.834 --> 01:00:41.496
So, thank you.

01:00:41.656 --> 01:00:42.016
All right.

01:00:42.036 --> 01:00:43.638
We've had two comments of this type.

01:00:43.678 --> 01:00:45.219
Can you address that directly?

01:00:45.239 --> 01:00:48.122
I mean, I thought we were more uniform than

01:00:49.810 --> 01:01:01.436
I think what Member Valdez and others are discussing is the fact that the advanced placement exams, international baccalaureate exams, and the completion of dual enrollment don't specify it needs to be mathematics and English language arts.

01:01:01.496 --> 01:01:03.618
It can be a component of any of those.

01:01:03.678 --> 01:01:07.420
Now, we know that advanced placement and international baccalaureate are based on

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:09.381
you know, academic measures.

01:01:10.261 --> 01:01:14.744
As an example that we use for dual enrollment, we would not give credit for physical education.

01:01:14.904 --> 01:01:17.486
It needs to be academic or CTE subjects.

01:01:17.506 --> 01:01:18.666
So there is that standard there.

01:01:18.826 --> 01:01:34.556
And to Member Ting's point, we have had a very, sorry, excuse me, Member Sun's point, we have had a very low amount of districts who have been able to submit data saying that they have met the dual enrollment requirements in CALPADS.

01:01:34.756 --> 01:01:36.477
And we have spent the last year

01:01:36.977 --> 01:01:40.938
doing a data boot camp for folks, getting ready for the college career indicator.

01:01:41.078 --> 01:01:59.965
And so I want to make sure that I give credit to my colleagues who have been out in the field talking to data folks at districts and at schools about the importance of making sure that they are tagging courses appropriately so that students can get credit for what they've been doing probably for a number of years.

01:02:00.485 --> 01:02:15.909
So, what has brought to light over the last year, because we've been able to display this information in the dashboard through some additional reports that are available on the department's website, is you can see how many students have met each of these measures within the cohort by student group.

01:02:16.009 --> 01:02:18.730
So, if you haven't seen those reports, they're very powerful.

01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:27.498
We've gotten a lot of good feedback from schools and districts that are, I think, a little surprised about where they have gaps.

01:02:27.558 --> 01:02:32.042
And maybe some of the gaps are really due to the quality of the data they are submitting.

01:02:33.383 --> 01:02:37.047
We also are limited, to go back to my first point, we're limited by the data we collect.

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:39.670
So, we do not collect wage data.

01:02:39.850 --> 01:02:46.138
I don't know what a student who has gone into the Army now makes four years later, five years later.

01:02:46.579 --> 01:02:50.704
I do not know what a student who is a translator is making four years later.

01:02:50.804 --> 01:02:53.187
So, we do not have access to wage data.

01:02:53.487 --> 01:02:55.549
We also do not have access to course completion data.

01:02:55.729 --> 01:03:03.194
That is a paid service from a national nonprofit that we, for the first time, were able to purchase a subscription this year.

01:03:03.234 --> 01:03:04.715
So we will be doing some data analysis.

01:03:04.995 --> 01:03:06.336
But that's a one-time subscription.

01:03:06.397 --> 01:03:07.998
And it is very expensive.

01:03:08.538 --> 01:03:10.379
That has been cost-prohibited for the last 10 years.

01:03:10.439 --> 01:03:12.641
So we can think about those things.

01:03:12.721 --> 01:03:18.565
But again, this is looking at a student's four-year career.

01:03:18.846 --> 01:03:21.868
It's 70-plus million data points.

01:03:23.028 --> 01:03:24.989
And so, it's been a challenge.

01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:35.315
I think it's definitely been a challenge and I, you know, the measures that we have recommended to be put in have gone through the vetting process that we have, you know, expressed for each one of these.

01:03:35.395 --> 01:03:38.076
So, we have followed what we have done for other measures.

01:03:38.096 --> 01:03:43.119
Board Member Ortiz-Lacon.

01:03:45.008 --> 01:03:50.353
If you look at the title is college slash career, clearly not college and career.

01:03:50.774 --> 01:03:54.377
So that answers the question, are we looking at this as college and career?

01:03:54.858 --> 01:03:55.398
No, we're not.

01:03:55.598 --> 01:04:01.004
Right now, my understanding of our previous conversation was that will be the well-prepared and we're not there yet.

01:04:01.444 --> 01:04:06.389
And so until we get to well-prepared, this indicator is a slash, college or career.

01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:17.020
And I want to go back to a point that was made earlier about now, why we didn't put the entire criteria of the CIELA by literacy, because it would take the entire slide.

01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:20.443
So that just tells you that it is already rigorous, right?

01:04:20.503 --> 01:04:27.431
And so I'm kind of hearing that, well, we need to validate it with something else because on its own, it's not as rigorous.

01:04:27.891 --> 01:04:35.736
But there's a lot of research that shows a correlation between college career readiness and bilingualism and biliteracy.

01:04:36.116 --> 01:04:39.258
So there's already a body of literature that substantiates that.

01:04:39.618 --> 01:04:48.023
And if you look at your graphs, you know, we already have a good understanding that a lot of the students would also meet, nearly meet, meet or exceed math.

01:04:48.424 --> 01:04:51.666
But adding the layer just seems like it's disproportionate.

01:04:52.066 --> 01:04:53.667
Carrick, do we have to bring the big dogs?

01:04:54.067 --> 01:04:54.787
What's happening here?

01:04:56.488 --> 01:05:01.150
Yeah, I'm taking you to church and it's only Thursday.

01:05:02.031 --> 01:05:09.334
So I don't believe that we have a consistent criteria that's been applied.

01:05:09.434 --> 01:05:13.836
And again, right now, by our own definition, this is a college slash career.

01:05:14.216 --> 01:05:17.698
Unfortunately, it is not college and career, which I think it's the goal that we all have.

01:05:18.898 --> 01:05:25.241
Can you speak to that first, college and or college or, and whether all of them are one or the other or

01:05:26.391 --> 01:05:28.312
So Carrick Ashley, deputy superintendent.

01:05:29.774 --> 01:05:33.917
So I think that's an important distinction here.

01:05:35.418 --> 01:05:41.403
We purposefully have it at college slash career.

01:05:41.663 --> 01:05:44.405
It's not an and, it's not even an or, but it's a slash.

01:05:44.745 --> 01:05:56.074
And it's simply because when you're setting up an accountability system, what you're trying to do is make it fair for all that are playing in that accountability system.

01:05:56.414 --> 01:06:02.436
which is why we have a separate but related system for our alternative schools.

01:06:02.896 --> 01:06:05.217
We want it to be fair for all of these schools.

01:06:05.757 --> 01:06:12.939
So we know that all schools don't emphasize the same thing across, which is a good thing.

01:06:13.427 --> 01:06:13.647
Right?

01:06:14.128 --> 01:06:23.255
In terms of college and career versus college and career, career tech ed, what a school emphasizes there to meet students' needs may not be the same.

01:06:23.315 --> 01:06:37.827
So we don't want to disadvantage schools that may have a specific emphasis in some kind of a career track, or a school that is very low on their career side, and they do all the emphasis on the college side.

01:06:39.368 --> 01:06:40.729
We want to make sure it's fair for all.

01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:49.074
Having said that, maybe I can help lower the anxiety here in that this is a policy decision.

01:06:49.394 --> 01:06:52.436
It's not a right or wrong decision.

01:06:52.776 --> 01:06:57.939
So you have a recommendation, but I can make an argument for either side of this.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.082
And the argument goes like this, if you're going to call this a

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:14.544
college-related criteria, then certainly scoring level one at mathematics is not being prepared for college.

01:07:15.004 --> 01:07:15.685
It just isn't.

01:07:16.245 --> 01:07:19.526
That's not enough rigor to consider that prepared.

01:07:20.266 --> 01:07:23.748
On the other hand, if you consider this a career indicator,

01:07:24.488 --> 01:07:32.094
For careers, clearly, bilingualism and biliteracy prepares you well for certain careers.

01:07:32.494 --> 01:07:36.678
There are other careers that won't be enough alone.

01:07:37.078 --> 01:07:45.305
But there are clearly careers out there where biliteracy and bilingualism does prepare you well for that career.

01:07:45.885 --> 01:08:03.651
So if you as a body decide not to include the mathematics criteria, I think it would be just our job to make it clear that this is a career criteria in the CCI, and it's not an indication that the student is prepared for college.

01:08:04.465 --> 01:08:08.809
because a level one for college is not prepared.

01:08:08.829 --> 01:08:11.792
It doesn't mean the student couldn't be successful, right?

01:08:11.812 --> 01:08:16.777
It means there's a lot of work, but at this point in time, with this score, they're not prepared.

01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:20.581
Okay, who's next?

01:08:21.722 --> 01:08:22.743
Board member Holliday.

01:08:25.259 --> 01:08:34.211
So I do think that if we look at the slash as or, which is what I've always been thinking.

01:08:34.612 --> 01:08:39.678
And that we look at this as a multiple measures approach as we've been talking about forever and ever.

01:08:40.583 --> 01:08:58.162
that it is perfectly acceptable to record and to distribute that information about the number of students in that school that have the seal of bioliteracy regardless of

01:08:58.983 --> 01:09:00.825
other academic performance.

01:09:02.446 --> 01:09:04.607
I care a great deal about science performance.

01:09:05.508 --> 01:09:07.790
I care a great deal about social studies performance.

01:09:07.870 --> 01:09:11.172
I care a great deal about all sorts of academic performance.

01:09:11.713 --> 01:09:16.356
I want a child to be well prepared in all of those realms.

01:09:17.297 --> 01:09:22.421
And yes, maybe math and ELA stand out for all sorts of reasons.

01:09:23.303 --> 01:09:35.462
But I do think this, the approach that I've taken, and thanks Member Sung for really articulating this much better than I am, but the and or is, I think, at the crux of this issue.

01:09:35.542 --> 01:09:36.624
And I've always seen it as or.

01:09:40.948 --> 01:09:53.054
When we do this, though, it doesn't necessarily mean that that school is being entirely successful in all respects with every student.

01:09:53.535 --> 01:09:55.476
But in terms of the seal of bioliteracy,

01:09:56.056 --> 01:09:59.639
they're doing a pretty good job, and that's worthy of celebration.

01:10:00.539 --> 01:10:12.348
And just as you said, Carrick, just now, schools do place different emphasis in different areas, and that's important to parents, and that's important to students, and ultimately to everyone.

01:10:12.428 --> 01:10:18.613
So I tend to lean toward keeping each of these measures

01:10:19.713 --> 01:10:29.176
clean and simple without an underlying baseline, if you will, unless that's going to be applied for every single one.

01:10:31.877 --> 01:10:35.118
Yeah, just to remark the slash to me is not clear.

01:10:35.358 --> 01:10:36.058
I mean.

01:10:37.341 --> 01:10:41.405
Well, there's a long debate as to, I mean, I don't know what a slash means.

01:10:41.525 --> 01:10:49.172
So, it could mean and, or, you say or, I could say and, you know, how we could argue about what a slash means.

01:10:50.053 --> 01:10:54.196
But we have some, it's not that clear to me anyway.

01:10:54.317 --> 01:10:55.277
But who's next?

01:10:55.317 --> 01:10:55.678
Sorry.

01:10:56.699 --> 01:10:57.479
Board Member Rucker.

01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:09.053
Okay, so I'm a little alarmed by what I just heard from the Department of Education concerning bilingualism.

01:11:09.653 --> 01:11:22.577
That somehow or other, there's a difference between what it means to be bilingual if you're trying to prepare for entry into the workforce and what it means to be bilingual

01:11:23.188 --> 01:11:26.609
when you're trying to prepare a student to go to college.

01:11:27.289 --> 01:11:41.533
Because the legislative intent of the law that created the state seal of biliteracy put a very heavy emphasis on academic preparation and coursework.

01:11:42.313 --> 01:11:50.737
as well as achievement on some very specific academic assessments aligned to that coursework.

01:11:51.578 --> 01:12:02.583
So to stand here and say that bilingualism, as documented for the performance of a student, is not about college preparation

01:12:03.423 --> 01:12:08.446
is something that I'm concerned about because I absolutely disagree.

01:12:08.846 --> 01:12:13.288
I don't have to read research to say that I would disagree on that.

01:12:14.449 --> 01:12:20.452
I would have to just go back to my own memory as a student taking a foreign language, both in high school and college.

01:12:20.792 --> 01:12:25.215
And for any parents who are working with and watching and monitoring their children,

01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:28.356
who are currently in high school taking that foreign language.

01:12:28.836 --> 01:12:33.558
I don't think they are thinking about which job their child is going to get.

01:12:33.578 --> 01:12:46.002
I think they are paying attention to what this means as an advantage for their child to have options to make decisions, not only about their career, but about college when they graduate.

01:12:46.442 --> 01:12:52.884
So I'm concerned that the way this conversation has taken on a different

01:12:54.109 --> 01:12:55.722
dimension that

01:12:58.225 --> 01:13:09.895
seems to be bifurcating the privilege of being identified as biliterate, not based on access, but based on something that's a little bit more unconscious.

01:13:09.955 --> 01:13:11.216
And I'm concerned about that.

01:13:11.697 --> 01:13:24.787
It's not fair that the state syllabi literacy, which has a very rigorous academic component, is being treated differently because we're suddenly now saying that that's a career indicator and not something else.

01:13:24.827 --> 01:13:26.128
That's not what I ever voted for.

01:13:26.889 --> 01:13:34.973
If that's the intent, then the indicator is not fair to any student or school who has created this opportunity.

01:13:35.534 --> 01:13:37.915
This is supposed to be a public policy.

01:13:38.495 --> 01:13:47.380
Nobody is going to remember this discussion five or six years down the road when none of us around this dais are on this dais anymore.

01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:52.263
They're only going to remember what the indicator defines.

01:13:53.086 --> 01:14:00.088
they are only going to remember what the indicator means and what the indicator is intended to report.

01:14:00.608 --> 01:14:02.329
So let's be real clear.

01:14:03.909 --> 01:14:20.954
If the indicator is intended to report college and career, college or career, and I thought I was voting for a balance that would report what districts and schools are doing to create access for all students so that students are ably able to make

01:14:21.514 --> 01:14:32.167
a choice among those two options for themselves, not dictated by public policy, then the indicator needs to be simple, straightforward.

01:14:32.607 --> 01:14:41.298
And as this conversation matures to being able to define what well-prepared means, we're not solely talking about well-prepared for college.

01:14:41.658 --> 01:14:43.960
but well prepared to enter a career.

01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:59.070
So I do not want to see and I did not believe I was voting for indicators or elements to be added to this indicator that were going to be used in separate ways for one type of it for college and in a different way for career.

01:14:59.490 --> 01:15:10.318
Again, that gets to a level of unconscious bias that's being written into this particular indicator that I do not believe I ever voted for.

01:15:11.596 --> 01:15:12.437
Board Member Burr.

01:15:15.738 --> 01:15:17.299
Back to the technical questions.

01:15:17.899 --> 01:15:27.745
Can I just have you do the... Go back to the slide that shows the percentage across the... Because I just want to make sure that I... Not that one, the one that shows... There we go.

01:15:28.765 --> 01:15:30.306
What the recommendation is.

01:15:30.506 --> 01:15:34.068
Because I wasn't at CPEG, so I didn't hear the feedback.

01:15:34.108 --> 01:15:39.151
But what I thought I heard in this conversation and based on what Member Rucker and Member Strauss said was that

01:15:39.891 --> 01:15:54.098
There was a recommendation at CPAG, recognizing they don't vote, that you expand what your initial staff recommendation was, that you include not only math, the standard met or exceeded, but also nearly met.

01:15:54.859 --> 01:16:00.662
So that those students who would not be counted for purposes of this indicator would be the 9.7%.

01:16:03.323 --> 01:16:03.923
Is that accurate?

01:16:03.943 --> 01:16:11.286
The recommendation to CPAG was the recommendation... No, no, I know, but I'm asking out of CPAG, how did you modify the recommendation that's now before us?

01:16:12.486 --> 01:16:13.247
Thank you for clarifying.

01:16:13.587 --> 01:16:24.911
The recommendation was modified to add an approaching prepared level so that a student who earns the state syllabi literacy achieves approaching prepared.

01:16:25.211 --> 01:16:29.399
So there would be a math component, but it would be broader.

01:16:29.699 --> 01:16:33.426
There would be no math component for the approaching prepared level.

01:16:33.446 --> 01:16:35.830
There is no math component for the state syllabi literacy.

01:16:38.496 --> 01:16:45.259
There is, for students who don't meet it, I'm getting confused between the chart and what the proposed criteria, I guess.

01:16:45.620 --> 01:16:57.846
The proposed criteria for prepared is not only to have met the state syllabi literacy, but to add a component that they need to score at least a level two or higher in mathematics.

01:16:58.286 --> 01:17:05.471
I think it's important to note that the state seal of bioliteracy requirements as a state seal do not include mathematics for coursework.

01:17:06.112 --> 01:17:08.113
It is all English language arts.

01:17:08.713 --> 01:17:12.616
Everything in that references that, as well as foreign language.

01:17:13.357 --> 01:17:22.183
So the approaching prepared level, which is the recommendation that came from a member from CPAG, was to add an approaching prepared

01:17:22.823 --> 01:17:24.524
category to this measure.

01:17:24.564 --> 01:17:29.527
That is not something that the College Career Indicator Workgroup advised or even came up with themselves.

01:17:29.607 --> 01:17:32.429
It came out of a rich discussion at CPAG.

01:17:32.849 --> 01:17:41.494
So that is what we have added since the CPAG discussion and vetted again through not only a technical design group but the LCFF stakeholder group.

01:17:41.574 --> 01:17:48.698
It has been shared over the last several weeks prior to the formal recommendation in the item you see today.

01:17:49.505 --> 01:18:03.789
So if we were to take the recommendation that I see here, it means that every student that earned a seal of biliteracy would be included in the CCI, either in the prepared level or approaching prepared?

01:18:03.809 --> 01:18:04.789
That's correct.

01:18:04.949 --> 01:18:16.193
And of those that earned a state seal of biliteracy in the period, we see that it's 86% of them that would meet the additional requirement under the prepared level.

01:18:17.353 --> 01:18:23.140
So I'll just say for me, I really am respectful of the seal it by literacy.

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:25.103
I think it's a wonderful tool.

01:18:25.723 --> 01:18:28.427
It's a wonderful achievement for students to have met it.

01:18:28.827 --> 01:18:34.194
But I worry a great deal about our mathematics performance in this state for every student.

01:18:34.754 --> 01:18:45.859
And to the extent we're trying to send messages to LEAs and schools about needing to improve academics across the board, I think it's important to keep kind of reinforcing that message.

01:18:45.919 --> 01:19:00.945
So I'm just a little bit, I'm on the cusp or on the fence here about whether or not to send a message somehow, being very cognizant of member Rucker's concerns about not creating unintended consequences for students.

01:19:02.429 --> 01:19:07.651
I do also just want to say to Member Sun's comment that I think we probably need to go back.

01:19:07.711 --> 01:19:19.555
I feel like every time we go to do the CCI, we have to like start all over again just to make sure that all of us understand it, how we got there, what the interactions are among these indicators.

01:19:20.355 --> 01:19:26.298
And I think that we are, we're really, now we're sort of hung up on, is it college, is it career, is it both?

01:19:26.858 --> 01:19:30.420
Maybe we need to step back and say, it's about high school success.

01:19:31.301 --> 01:19:36.843
Have we been successful at the high school in preparing students for whatever they're gonna do next?

01:19:37.444 --> 01:19:46.048
Because otherwise, I think we do get these sort of unconscious bias conversations going about, oh, you care more about career or more about college or whatever.

01:19:46.528 --> 01:19:52.875
No, we want to have a very well-rounded, effective program for every student that goes through high school.

01:19:53.575 --> 01:19:55.377
So I'll just put that out there for you.

01:19:55.598 --> 01:19:56.939
Thank you for the clarification.

01:19:56.959 --> 01:20:03.546
Okay.

01:20:05.027 --> 01:20:06.369
Go ahead, Board Member Cardenas.

01:20:07.176 --> 01:20:07.616
Is it on?

01:20:07.976 --> 01:20:08.156
Yeah.

01:20:08.356 --> 01:20:08.816
Oh, OK.

01:20:09.517 --> 01:20:09.677
Yeah.

01:20:09.737 --> 01:20:09.937
OK.

01:20:10.297 --> 01:20:10.597
Sorry.

01:20:10.897 --> 01:20:12.717
And sorry if I speak is kind of repetitive.

01:20:12.858 --> 01:20:15.138
So a little closer.

01:20:15.338 --> 01:20:15.638
Sorry.

01:20:16.719 --> 01:20:25.881
So I agree with a lot of the things that other board members said around the CCI, the CCI, because college and career indicator is like very confusing.

01:20:26.241 --> 01:20:35.585
Because when you have that gray area, when it's undecided what this title means, that means when it comes to accountability, people could do it the way they feel it could benefit them.

01:20:35.885 --> 01:20:39.126
So there needs to be a very specific title to this.

01:20:39.226 --> 01:20:41.507
If not, people could just bend it how they want to.

01:20:41.867 --> 01:20:45.609
And I understand about like, you know, this school might concentrate on this career and that.

01:20:46.109 --> 01:20:47.490
But honestly, when I see the

01:20:48.570 --> 01:20:50.311
purpose of the college career indicator.

01:20:50.351 --> 01:20:59.634
It says the CCI was developed to emphasize that a high school diploma represents the completion of a broad rigorous course of study that prepares students for success after high school.

01:21:00.074 --> 01:21:13.999
So maybe thinking of a title like post-secondary readiness like something like that instead of college or career because to be honest not every student wants to go to college and sometimes the career that students want to go into is not provided by the education system for a lot of students.

01:21:14.279 --> 01:21:16.400
So really thinking about what that title means and what

01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:29.957
post-secondary readiness means should be added to this because it needs to be a really strong definition to have great accountability and great success because we can't have all these criteria that keeps getting added because there's a lot of confusion.

01:21:29.977 --> 01:21:30.718
Thank you.

01:21:30.758 --> 01:21:34.083
Okay, Board Member Valdez.

01:21:35.473 --> 01:21:37.415
Over time we are just getting clarification.

01:21:37.455 --> 01:21:59.295
I appreciate what appreciate what member Cardenas is saying and I Know from a couple board meetings ago I was surprised and I'm going to go back to the and or just for a second because I brought it up I didn't realize that it had changed or and I was confused so and that had been in a memo But it's how we message this out and how we try to bring clarity so the slash and eventually might become a dash But that that's semantics, right?

01:22:00.396 --> 01:22:14.183
Well, it is to a point, but my question is, we've got a CCI workgroup and we've got CPAG and we've got different recommendations from both groups and conversations and meaning is greater over time, right?

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:19.426
So when we are going to report this CCI indicator as a district,

01:22:20.086 --> 01:22:23.007
or, you know, you're going to get a color, correct?

01:22:23.487 --> 01:22:26.349
And the district is going to get it and the school is going to get it.

01:22:26.889 --> 01:22:28.670
But is it going to be broken down?

01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:32.471
So I know my percentage of in all five, the report will show that.

01:22:32.751 --> 01:22:43.156
OK, so the exact same thing we are showing currently on on the department's CCI report, which actually breaks it down by indicator, but then it further breaks it down by student group.

01:22:43.356 --> 01:22:49.038
So it is it is diving into the data that's included in this measure to each of those different measures that were in it.

01:22:49.398 --> 01:22:56.960
So then just finally, I just feel like, again, I think math is important, but if we're going to do it, we should do it for all of them.

01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:00.401
Thank you.

01:23:00.801 --> 01:23:09.024
Yeah, I'm still not sure where we are on college and career or college or career.

01:23:09.815 --> 01:23:21.490
And I know different people have different views, so I'll give you mine, which is that college and career, as I participated in the national debate, so it's not just California.

01:23:22.578 --> 01:23:25.619
I have been active in the national debate on this.

01:23:25.699 --> 01:23:34.623
In the national debate, there's one people in a camp that say there's absolutely no difference.

01:23:34.643 --> 01:23:39.985
And therefore, for example, the Smarter Balance Test is equally good for college and career.

01:23:40.045 --> 01:23:40.685
They're the same.

01:23:41.106 --> 01:23:46.368
The National Organization Achieve has advocated that all along.

01:23:47.108 --> 01:23:54.916
And then there's a college or career group, which I'm in, which is the view that they are different.

01:23:55.236 --> 01:24:00.041
I think Kerrick Ashley presented that pretty accurately.

01:24:00.562 --> 01:24:05.807
Many states have a separate system of career and technical colleges.

01:24:06.247 --> 01:24:08.690
They don't have a comprehensive colleges.

01:24:10.331 --> 01:24:11.872
my home state, Pennsylvania.

01:24:11.932 --> 01:24:15.315
The community college system is a career tech system.

01:24:15.415 --> 01:24:18.798
It has no transfer links to it.

01:24:18.878 --> 01:24:20.179
That was true in Ohio.

01:24:20.199 --> 01:24:22.941
I don't know whether it's true all through the South.

01:24:23.681 --> 01:24:35.631
There's a gigantic system in Georgia called technical colleges, which is below the community colleges and run by a separate board of technical colleges.

01:24:36.482 --> 01:24:38.203
Texas has the same system.

01:24:38.483 --> 01:24:45.385
And so there is nationally a, I believe, a distinction between college or career.

01:24:46.385 --> 01:24:50.446
And the slash doesn't do much for me in clarifying this debate.

01:24:51.246 --> 01:25:00.289
So to me, we are proceeding without clear definitions or understandings of the basic underlying concepts we're dealing with here.

01:25:01.286 --> 01:25:10.716
So this discussion, which is on a particular indicator, I don't associate this with this.

01:25:11.236 --> 01:25:14.479
It opened up bigger issues is what happened here to me.

01:25:14.679 --> 01:25:19.324
And so this is not just a discussion about this particular indicator.

01:25:19.384 --> 01:25:22.307
It's just a good one to elucidate.

01:25:22.327 --> 01:25:23.288
And I suspect that

01:25:24.589 --> 01:25:29.654
JROTC is going to be another one when we get around to this as well.

01:25:29.734 --> 01:25:34.238
I'm not sure how strong that is for college preparation, but that's to come.

01:25:34.418 --> 01:25:35.679
I don't know much about it.

01:25:35.739 --> 01:25:36.139
Go ahead.

01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:38.161
So I appreciate those comments.

01:25:38.401 --> 01:25:51.453
And going back to what Member Ortiz-Lacombe said, one of the reasons we went to the slash, which can be considered or at this point, was the discussion of the well-prepared category in which

01:25:52.469 --> 01:26:03.998
If, when we come to that discussion, you'll have a lot of people who are going to advocate for it to be an and at the well-prepared level.

01:26:05.279 --> 01:26:06.179
I wouldn't be one of them.

01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:11.003
But there are some that feel very strongly it needs to be and.

01:26:11.543 --> 01:26:15.967
The reason I prefer the or is from the student level.

01:26:16.767 --> 01:26:19.690
Because what we do here does incentivize

01:26:20.495 --> 01:26:22.435
districts and schools to do certain things.

01:26:23.076 --> 01:26:39.880
And so if it becomes an and, and it incentivizes high schools to try to diversify as much as possible what a student does in their high school career, which is fine for students that want to do that.

01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:57.439
But I can tell you, as a parent of three that went through high school, it was very difficult for us to make decisions about what my sons were going to take in high school, because there were all these criterias that went along with it.

01:26:58.479 --> 01:26:59.820
He wanted to do jazz band.

01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:05.342
Well, the school had a rule that says, to do jazz band, you also have to be an orchestra.

01:27:05.922 --> 01:27:07.983
So there goes two electives.

01:27:08.243 --> 01:27:13.946
And so when schools do that, it eliminates the choices that an individual student has.

01:27:14.206 --> 01:27:24.250
And if a student wants a strong emphasis in some career tech ed or some fine arts category, we don't want a school

01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:38.804
trying to push them into, no, you need to take things that go across the entire curriculum because we have an indicator here that says and, and we want to get as many students in that and category as possible.

01:27:39.144 --> 01:27:49.194
So we want students and families to make those decisions of where the emphasis of their education is going to be, not coming from the top down to the families.

01:27:52.495 --> 01:27:53.235
Okay.

01:27:53.395 --> 01:27:57.297
We need to, we'll maybe need to move on soon.

01:27:57.357 --> 01:28:00.898
Board Member Rucker, you end up the last word here on the technical questions.

01:28:00.938 --> 01:28:01.878
We're not acting yet.

01:28:02.099 --> 01:28:02.279
Yeah.

01:28:03.319 --> 01:28:05.620
I am so happy I get to have the last word.

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:22.066
So let me, so let me just say, Mr. Ashley, I absolutely, Director Ashley, I absolutely agree that with everything you just explained about how this policy needs to operate at the student level,

01:28:22.566 --> 01:28:28.652
so that we maximize the opportunity and the choices that students and their parents have.

01:28:29.092 --> 01:28:39.842
That requirement is still in statute and that requirement is the basis for my understanding about how this indicator is supposed to work so that it would be a college or career indicator.

01:28:40.382 --> 01:29:01.716
What concerns me is that each time we have this discussion, there is a nuance that is added that is something I don't agree with, which is, as we look at the different levels, approaching, well-prepared, prepared, that there is somehow a difference in how the indicators will be applied.

01:29:01.876 --> 01:29:04.538
Some indicators won't be applied, for example,

01:29:04.998 --> 01:29:13.282
at the well-prepared level, including by literacy, if by literacy doesn't also have this mathematics element.

01:29:13.642 --> 01:29:15.923
That's not what I believe we should be doing.

01:29:15.963 --> 01:29:30.129
We should not, if the indicators need to be uniform and consistently applied and understood in reference, in a context at all of those levels, which is what I thought we were developing and maturing

01:29:30.609 --> 01:29:34.612
in the creation and addition of each of these elements into this indicator.

01:29:34.972 --> 01:29:45.200
Today, I'm hearing that there's going to be a difference in how some indicators will be applied at the well-prepared level and some may not be included or considered at all.

01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:46.661
I don't agree with that.

01:29:47.001 --> 01:29:55.588
And if that is the purpose of the action we are contemplating today based on this recommendation, this is not a recommendation I'm ready to support.

01:29:55.648 --> 01:29:57.209
I think we need to take a step back

01:29:57.689 --> 01:30:04.678
and make a clear decision, are all of the indicators being included going to be considered at each level?

01:30:04.958 --> 01:30:12.087
Or are we really and truly building an indicator where some of the elements in this indicator won't be applied at all levels?

01:30:12.127 --> 01:30:13.708
That's not something I can agree with.

01:30:14.329 --> 01:30:23.533
because if it's truly going to be college or career, that definition and how that criteria needs to be applied needs to be looked at at all levels, not just at some.

01:30:23.953 --> 01:30:40.900
And as it relates particularly to this indicator, choosing not to include biliteracy and bilingualism means that we're making a policy statement about bilingual students and college preparation as a policy in our indicator.

01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:43.881
That goes back to the days when it used to be okay

01:30:44.461 --> 01:30:55.670
under our old accountability system for students of color to perform 20 points lower than the other students in their school and the district was still considered a high-achieving school district.

01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:58.372
That is not something we should be doing today.

01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:03.141
All right, I think we're ready to move to the next indicator.

01:31:04.901 --> 01:31:11.743
And I think all of these will help us because we're really searching for some common policy and common definitions here.

01:31:12.143 --> 01:31:15.043
The discussion's been very rich and good, I think.

01:31:16.424 --> 01:31:21.065
And so, Golden State and then, yeah, go ahead.

01:31:21.425 --> 01:31:21.826
Thank you.

01:31:22.466 --> 01:31:30.356
So the Golden State Seal Merit Diploma requirements requires that, and again this was a long one too, it's a full page.

01:31:30.556 --> 01:31:34.921
I'm not going to read it unless we need to go down that road again like we did for the prior one.

01:31:36.503 --> 01:31:41.648
Students must complete coursework under a broad course of study.

01:31:41.708 --> 01:31:53.338
And specifically, there is six subject areas, with the minimum of the subject areas being English language arts, mathematics, science, and US history.

01:31:54.239 --> 01:32:02.226
Above and beyond that, the two additional courses have variants to it, a higher level science class or something beyond US history, those kinds of things.

01:32:02.626 --> 01:32:05.808
There are minimum grade requirements for those courses.

01:32:06.649 --> 01:32:09.010
Typically, it's a B+, although for U.S.

01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:20.638
history, it's a B. So with that in mind, it is similar to A through G, but it's not A through G. A through G has specific requirements for each of the subject areas.

01:32:21.578 --> 01:32:26.682
And it looks at really a student completing A through G throughout the four years.

01:32:27.242 --> 01:32:33.766
There is some that have made comments that the Golden Seal's merit diploma could be completed earlier than four years.

01:32:33.866 --> 01:32:39.289
So it's not necessarily looking at the full complement of the student's

01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:41.991
the students work.

01:32:43.712 --> 01:32:47.375
The other piece is that test scores may be used in place of course grades.

01:32:47.495 --> 01:32:51.518
So there is that mechanism in Golden State that's written in there.

01:32:52.538 --> 01:32:56.481
It is considered, we are suggesting that be considered a measure of college preparedness.

01:32:58.777 --> 01:33:09.712
So of the 91,206 students who earned the Golden State Seal, again, we're looking at the comparison to the Smarter Balanced, English Language Arts, and the next slide will be Mathematics.

01:33:10.172 --> 01:33:15.840
So for those that earned it, you do have students, and again, there's not a,

01:33:16.841 --> 01:33:26.610
There is an and or, so you don't have to have a certain level, which is why I don't have a box around this like I did the prior slides for the state seal by literacy.

01:33:27.311 --> 01:33:33.816
But you can see on average that students, especially in the standard exceeded levels and

01:33:35.318 --> 01:33:40.663
levels are doing quite better than their peers than those that did not earn the Golden State Seal.

01:33:40.723 --> 01:33:49.470
And this is done, you know, it's an evaluation at the local level of a student and so there is some requirements on the local level to determine that the student has met these criteria.

01:33:49.891 --> 01:33:52.673
We've only begun collecting this information at the student level in 2017.

01:33:52.713 --> 01:33:53.374
So again this is

01:33:55.436 --> 01:33:56.817
Level 3 or level 2?

01:33:57.077 --> 01:34:05.524
Level 3 would be standard met, so that's the 29,071 and then standard exceeded is that 55, the bulk of the students, 55,657.

01:34:05.744 --> 01:34:15.432
You do have students that earned the Golden State Seal, as you can see, that scored level 1 in English Language Arts and level 2 in English Language Arts.

01:34:16.966 --> 01:34:30.157
As a comparison for mathematics of the 91,078 who earned the SEAL and took the exam, you see not as high of figures as you did in the prior version.

01:34:30.197 --> 01:34:36.823
So the prior version had close to 55,000 students earning and getting that highest level math standard exceeded.

01:34:37.583 --> 01:34:39.565
In this, for mathematics, you see them at 38%.

01:34:40.706 --> 01:34:48.913
But again, it's above those that did not earn the Golden State Seal Diploma, which is just 6%.

01:34:49.774 --> 01:34:56.059
Again, with standard met, you are seeing higher performance in math in that level as well.

01:34:56.119 --> 01:34:58.100
But this is not a requirement.

01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:00.843
This can be used in lieu of a requirement.

01:35:00.863 --> 01:35:04.766
So this is an or option in the criteria.

01:35:06.897 --> 01:35:10.479
So just to complete out, there's just a couple more slides.

01:35:10.879 --> 01:35:14.721
This one is comparing Golden State's Merit Diploma and A through G completion.

01:35:14.901 --> 01:35:16.202
Again, this is not the same thing.

01:35:16.682 --> 01:35:32.490
But just to give you a comparison of how they did, of the 93,000 students that took, or rather that earned the Merit Diploma, 87% also completed A through G. And of the entire cohort of the class of 2017, nearly 200,000 completed A through G.

01:35:35.717 --> 01:35:39.958
And of those 200,000, about 40% earned the Golden State Seal.

01:35:40.018 --> 01:35:43.499
So it is not something that is universal statewide.

01:35:43.539 --> 01:35:47.599
I'm obviously with the amounts.

01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:59.942
But it is something that a group of students is working on and has earned and is considered an important piece on their high school career.

01:36:00.902 --> 01:36:08.284
So the slide that I'm showing you is simply the data that we've just spoken about in a table format.

01:36:08.484 --> 01:36:14.586
So we're looking at those that earned a Golden State Seal, that completed the A through G requirements, and those that did not.

01:36:14.626 --> 01:36:21.348
So there were some that earned the Golden State Seal that did not complete the A through G requirements, but the majority of them did.

01:36:22.789 --> 01:36:29.114
And then of the total cohort, those that did not earn the Golden State Seal that completed A-G versus those that did not.

01:36:29.395 --> 01:36:32.097
So A-G of course is not a state requirement.

01:36:32.117 --> 01:36:37.482
It is something that is adopted at the local level for some high schools and some districts.

01:36:40.814 --> 01:36:44.399
The Golden State Seal does capture some additional students.

01:36:44.419 --> 01:36:52.170
So we know, based on the data that we've run, that 12,206 students who earned the merit diploma but did not complete the A through J requirements.

01:36:53.739 --> 01:36:58.944
90% of students earning the merit diploma who scored the level three or higher on English language arts.

01:36:59.965 --> 01:37:05.891
Also, we have a very high percentage of 78% scored a level three or higher on the mathematics piece.

01:37:05.931 --> 01:37:12.678
So there is a high correlation of these students doing well on the Smarter Balanced assessments.

01:37:13.581 --> 01:37:17.664
And so finally, the recommendation is for prepared that is a standalone measure.

01:37:18.024 --> 01:37:25.389
And of the students who earned the Golden State merit, you would see 12,206 students in the class meeting the criteria.

01:37:27.190 --> 01:37:27.530
Okay.

01:37:27.691 --> 01:37:31.353
A little history here for people that may not go back so far.

01:37:31.433 --> 01:37:35.296
I think this started when Delaine Easton was superintendent.

01:37:36.425 --> 01:37:53.933
The idea was in an era when we had very few incentives and markers for higher achievement, was that the Golden State exam was and will and was clearly linked to a set of rigorous end of course exams.

01:37:54.793 --> 01:38:13.958
It was the first move the state had in end-of-course exams and then we continued those under the California standards test when we also had end-of-course exams and then abolished them, the end-of-course exams with the overhaul towards smarter balanced test.

01:38:14.898 --> 01:38:20.640
So, this had real coherence and you had to pass these assessments

01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:26.445
And it was an entirely different concept than it is now.

01:38:27.906 --> 01:38:33.031
What the rationale was for preserving it after we dropped the test escapes me.

01:38:33.111 --> 01:38:38.195
But that, I guess it's in statute and code, right?

01:38:38.496 --> 01:38:38.736
Yeah.

01:38:39.756 --> 01:38:47.798
And so it was really that we're going to set out subject matter assessments and, of course, assessments.

01:38:48.358 --> 01:38:50.238
And that was what it was all about.

01:38:50.478 --> 01:38:54.379
So I just want to point out that history.

01:38:54.559 --> 01:38:58.100
I didn't even realize till this came up that this thing was still around.

01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:02.601
And so because the original rationale was undercut.

01:39:02.681 --> 01:39:04.501
So with that, Board Member Dasan, we'll go.

01:39:05.874 --> 01:39:09.336
Okay, so I have two concerns with this measure.

01:39:09.636 --> 01:39:14.119
One, I don't believe the measure itself is ready for prime time.

01:39:14.879 --> 01:39:24.465
I don't agree with the comparison to A through G, broad course of study, because the requirement, you know, as President Kirst mentioned,

01:39:25.385 --> 01:39:33.871
This used to be, a student earned this by taking a rigorous end-of-course exam that was given by the state.

01:39:34.251 --> 01:39:43.217
It has since been replaced with making a grade of B plus or better for two... Or B in some cases.

01:39:43.257 --> 01:39:43.377
Yeah.

01:39:43.417 --> 01:39:44.097
B in one place.

01:39:44.958 --> 01:39:45.778
B, okay.

01:39:45.818 --> 01:39:49.661
So in a single course each semester for one year.

01:39:51.872 --> 01:39:53.593
So it is just one year.

01:39:53.853 --> 01:40:11.518
So a student could make, in a very introductory math course, a B plus or above, and in English language arts, a science class, et cetera, without any understanding of the rigor and consistency in the grades.

01:40:11.538 --> 01:40:17.720
But they could do that technically and earn this seal, this Golden State seal.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:23.485
and be what we're calling prepared on our CCI.

01:40:24.046 --> 01:40:26.408
So now this goes then to the second piece.

01:40:26.648 --> 01:40:34.536
First of all, I don't feel like the measure itself is really rigorous and does not represent a broad course of study as we are looking at in a preparation.

01:40:35.197 --> 01:40:37.840
And the second is the lack of consistency.

01:40:39.575 --> 01:40:56.158
I feel that the measure we just talked about, the seal by literacy, has a much more rigorous aspect to that than the Golden State Seal Diploma.

01:40:57.018 --> 01:41:04.880
And it is much, much less rigorous than A through G, which we are requiring additional measures

01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:18.774
Additional criteria on top of that and that was based on some that That there was research on a through g that a through g ended up itself It's not enough and therefore that's why we added the additional criteria.

01:41:19.255 --> 01:41:25.562
There's no research that the seal of golden seal merit diploma

01:41:27.248 --> 01:41:30.371
guarantees that that student is going to be prepared.

01:41:30.911 --> 01:41:34.194
And I am very concerned that it's a standalone.

01:41:34.634 --> 01:41:38.417
If we were to go with it as a standalone, we technically

01:41:39.418 --> 01:41:53.768
give the prepared level to a student who is, well, excuse me, 22% of those students are not meeting the math level, right?

01:41:53.789 --> 01:41:59.953
22% of the students who earn GSMD are not meeting the math standard level.

01:42:00.313 --> 01:42:07.578
That is a much higher percentage than what we saw with the students who earned this seal of biliteracy.

01:42:08.499 --> 01:42:17.402
So, it's around the inconsistency of what these recommendations are and what's going into this particular, the measures that are going into this indicator.

01:42:19.003 --> 01:42:19.563
Who's next?

01:42:23.125 --> 01:42:23.845
Board member Rucker.

01:42:27.482 --> 01:42:30.424
I agree with what Board Member Sung has pointed out.

01:42:30.925 --> 01:42:49.697
I won't repeat the things that she stated, but I will repeat my concern that the criteria that is going to be used in this indicator need to be uniform and consistent, need to be uniformly and consistently considered for each of the levels of prepared, approaching prepared and well-prepared.

01:42:50.397 --> 01:43:03.423
And if this is going to be the definition of what well-prepared means, it definitely should not be less rigorous than the indicator we have for the indicator that is not a standalone for the state seal of biliteracy.

01:43:03.463 --> 01:43:13.028
There needs to be a level of rigor considered among each of the criteria at each of these levels that looks comparable and this does not.

01:43:15.889 --> 01:43:16.690
Board member Burr.

01:43:18.964 --> 01:43:46.117
So Cindy, I guess, could you just answer the question I think that was embedded in board member Sun's comments about, as I understand it from the agenda, that the technical design group, which we try to rely on in terms of validity and reliability, supported the inclusion of what we just talked about, the seal of biliteracy in combination with mathematics to maintain consistency with other criteria.

01:43:46.757 --> 01:43:50.478
including CTE pathway completion and the A to G measures.

01:43:51.279 --> 01:43:56.460
So why did they recommend that those two be linked?

01:43:57.220 --> 01:44:01.882
And there is no other recommendation like that for this Golden State.

01:44:03.186 --> 01:44:12.113
One of the things that the TGE looked at was to look at the percentage of students who are scoring at least a level three on both ELA and math.

01:44:13.034 --> 01:44:27.806
And when you look at the Golden State Seal Merit Diploma, the percentage of students who are scoring well in both areas are very high, just as is so with the students who are taking AP and IP exams and scoring three or higher.

01:44:28.207 --> 01:44:31.810
So the percentage of students scoring at the higher levels are much higher for that.

01:44:32.630 --> 01:44:43.156
And there's also, they're very well aware that we want to put some measures into the CCI that are not strictly based on test.

01:44:43.756 --> 01:44:49.359
We've been hearing that very clearly from the state board that we should have something in there other than test scores.

01:44:49.919 --> 01:44:54.642
And so that is the reason why they chose to support that.

01:44:55.983 --> 01:45:00.729
I think I'll just say for me and I think I'm picking up this vibe from everybody.

01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:13.066
There seems to be a level of inconsistency here and things that are kind of counterintuitive to us non-data nerds that where you think A to G is a pretty rigorous requirement

01:45:13.526 --> 01:45:26.180
since that's what UC is expecting completion on, that to say that A to G needs to be linked with something else, but not the Golden State Merit Diploma, it just, it doesn't ring true in my little head.

01:45:26.801 --> 01:45:33.068
So I think that's what we're struggling with here is how we're maintaining consistency across these indicators.

01:45:35.263 --> 01:45:35.704
Yeah, sorry.

01:45:36.224 --> 01:45:37.024
Board Member Sun.

01:45:37.584 --> 01:45:47.308
And this is where I go back to the measure itself is not ready for prime time because the difference between counting an English course

01:45:50.407 --> 01:45:57.535
grade versus actually meeting standard at 11th grade is very, very different.

01:45:57.735 --> 01:46:00.538
And the LEA can choose one or the other.

01:46:01.118 --> 01:46:11.830
The measure itself has such wide range that I'm not sure how we ensure any kind of reliability validity to this particular measure within the index.

01:46:12.423 --> 01:46:14.764
Right, and I understand your comments.

01:46:14.824 --> 01:46:20.345
And that's one reason why we always go back to look at how students are performing on the Smarter Balanced Assessment.

01:46:20.906 --> 01:46:31.469
And when you're looking at students who receive the diploma, you have a very high percentage, 90% that are scoring high on English language arts and 78% on math.

01:46:32.129 --> 01:46:38.811
That is solid evidence that the diploma is actually producing students who are doing well in both subject areas.

01:46:38.911 --> 01:46:39.031
Right.

01:46:39.391 --> 01:46:39.872
I agree.

01:46:39.892 --> 01:46:41.973
I think it's we're backwards mapping it.

01:46:42.013 --> 01:46:44.014
We're saying right now there's a correlation.

01:46:44.094 --> 01:46:48.117
However, the standard in and of itself will not correlate.

01:46:48.177 --> 01:46:57.183
And if we continue on this, we will have LEAs that will choose the path of leach resistance, if you will.

01:46:57.823 --> 01:47:00.805
And that's where it will start getting very mushy.

01:47:00.825 --> 01:47:03.087
Board Member Holiday.

01:47:04.748 --> 01:47:07.670
Once again, Member Sung, I think you're spot on with this.

01:47:09.008 --> 01:47:12.633
But we do have to remember that all of these things are apples and oranges, right?

01:47:14.074 --> 01:47:25.929
And if you want to find some sort of level of consistency among all of them, the criteria, that's going to be a very difficult thing to do from a data perspective, I imagine, or a statistical perspective.

01:47:26.756 --> 01:47:36.467
It might be an argument for why minimum academic performance should be the underlying factor in all of these across the board.

01:47:36.827 --> 01:47:42.814
But the difference between the field of bioliteracy, the A through D courses, the military science stuff,

01:47:43.675 --> 01:47:44.375
They're all different.

01:47:44.955 --> 01:47:49.017
And for some students, one may be more rigorous than another.

01:47:49.057 --> 01:47:51.137
And for another student, it may not be that rigorous.

01:47:51.297 --> 01:47:59.420
I mean, if you're already a bilingual student, the seal of biliteracy may not be quite as difficult as for another student.

01:47:59.460 --> 01:48:01.600
So they're all apples and oranges.

01:48:02.221 --> 01:48:03.081
I'm OK with that.

01:48:03.561 --> 01:48:04.841
I'm OK with the or.

01:48:05.061 --> 01:48:13.244
I'm OK with schools having this be something that they're proud of and they're preparing students well for that.

01:48:13.803 --> 01:48:23.422
But if that's not where we want to go, then there has to be sort of an underlying evening leveling data thing, such as test scores or whatever.

01:48:23.863 --> 01:48:25.847
And you did wear red today for a reason, didn't you?

01:48:29.131 --> 01:48:33.855
Okay, maybe we're ready to move on to military science at this point.

01:48:33.875 --> 01:48:43.124
I just wanted to add one comment that my boss reminded me of is that this board, maybe not these members, did set the criteria for the Golden State Seal Merit Diploma.

01:48:43.624 --> 01:48:43.784
So...

01:48:45.646 --> 01:48:47.909
We can have a conversation.

01:48:47.929 --> 01:48:50.672
It wasn't under my leadership either.

01:48:50.872 --> 01:48:53.755
This predates me, but I just wanted to make you aware of that.

01:48:54.456 --> 01:48:59.322
And since we're batting zero for two, let's try with number three.

01:49:01.344 --> 01:49:11.336
The other thing Jenny reminded me of is as we think about these things and you look at what's currently in the CCI, we are very heavily dependent on Smarter Balance if none of these measures are adopted.

01:49:11.536 --> 01:49:19.826
And so we do have a three-year plan to build out this to make it more career measures and we've had great success.

01:49:20.347 --> 01:49:24.348
Great work with our College Career Transition Division and the community colleges.

01:49:24.408 --> 01:49:36.052
So we think we're going to get there on some other measures, but I want to put that in perspective as we go through this last item of, rather last piece of this first part of the recommendation.

01:49:36.572 --> 01:49:40.354
So this is Leadership Science, again, Junior ROTC.

01:49:41.454 --> 01:49:43.535
So the J is added in these slides.

01:49:44.735 --> 01:49:48.317
And high school students can participate in JROTC each year.

01:49:48.558 --> 01:49:53.661
Some participate one year, some participate two, three, or their entire high school piece.

01:49:54.561 --> 01:50:01.525
Finishing the four years does not automatically qualify them to join the military.

01:50:01.545 --> 01:50:07.909
They also must meet the academic eligibility criteria, the ASVAB, or the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery Test.

01:50:09.853 --> 01:50:14.761
JROTC provides advanced rank if the student enlists, which translates into work experience.

01:50:14.801 --> 01:50:22.294
So for example, our research showed that the Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps provide six months, and I think the Navy was upwards of nine months.

01:50:24.053 --> 01:50:29.417
So we have this table which shows you the number of years a student participated.

01:50:29.537 --> 01:50:32.419
I don't know which year it is, maybe their senior year, maybe their freshman year.

01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:39.024
Only if it's one year or two years, maybe it's sophomore and junior or sophomore and senior.

01:50:39.444 --> 01:50:43.247
But we do again look at the measurement against the Smarter Balanced because that's been our

01:50:43.647 --> 01:50:44.368
are benchmarks.

01:50:44.828 --> 01:51:00.681
And so you can see of the students that have taken the, or rather who have taken this coursework, again this is a course enrollment in CALPADS, you see by years, by total years, how well they did on English Language Arts.

01:51:00.741 --> 01:51:08.848
And so the number of students who, you know, standards exceeded versus standard met, standard nearly met, and so on and so forth.

01:51:11.421 --> 01:51:28.126
We did, in our analysis, we found that the distribution of the English language arts scores for the four years of data signals that a better performance on the summit of ELA had, of course, was with more involvement in JROTC, they were doing better.

01:51:28.206 --> 01:51:36.628
So just to go back to that chart, you can see the levels do increase as we proceed with the years of JROTC.

01:51:38.553 --> 01:51:55.628
So the recommendation from the department to the board is for the prepared level, the student completes at least two years of JROTC, that there's a minimum assessment requirement of at least standard met in the English language arts or math, and the student scored standard met in the other subject area.

01:51:55.688 --> 01:51:59.191
So it could be English or math, and then English or math in the second piece.

01:51:59.951 --> 01:52:05.293
So, we have half a percent of students in the graduating class of 2017 who met the criteria.

01:52:05.673 --> 01:52:12.435
For approaching prepared, again, about half a percent who meet the criteria, which is just that they complete the coursework.

01:52:12.575 --> 01:52:15.235
So, it's just a simple coursework, no assessment requirements.

01:52:16.136 --> 01:52:20.037
And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to President Kirsten.

01:52:20.157 --> 01:52:22.677
Well, we'll have board member Holliday since he won't speak.

01:52:22.717 --> 01:52:22.897
Thanks.

01:52:25.538 --> 01:52:27.779
That chart is very interesting to me.

01:52:27.799 --> 01:52:39.685
I think it is really clear that for the handful of students that we're talking about, when they stay in JROTC for four years, that their scores really do go up.

01:52:39.746 --> 01:52:40.486
And that's a great thing.

01:52:40.906 --> 01:52:42.927
That's a nice reality.

01:52:43.988 --> 01:52:52.132
So there are other military science leadership programs in California, including the California Cadet Corps.

01:52:54.813 --> 01:53:08.321
Did you take time to think about whether or not, is there a reason why you stuck with just JROTC and eliminated other sorts of leadership military science course work?

01:53:09.381 --> 01:53:17.166
Because actually, the governor's military school does not follow JROTC, but it is a military school.

01:53:17.915 --> 01:53:20.876
I'm going to ask Jenny to come up since she did the actual analysis.

01:53:20.936 --> 01:53:23.176
I thought it was just based on the actual course name.

01:53:24.177 --> 01:53:27.417
It was based on the actual course name of military leadership.

01:53:28.118 --> 01:53:30.778
Most people are familiar when we say military leadership.

01:53:30.798 --> 01:53:31.979
They're like what is that.

01:53:32.099 --> 01:53:34.759
And so we reference JROTC.

01:53:35.459 --> 01:53:43.101
But there are other that doesn't necessarily mean that a school can't have something a little bit different and report it in the military leadership.

01:53:43.501 --> 01:53:45.742
That's the only course that we collect in CALPADS.

01:53:46.041 --> 01:53:54.109
Yeah, see that's what I was actually thinking was the case, is that what you're talking about here is a course code, right?

01:53:54.750 --> 01:54:04.940
And you're not talking about necessarily a specific curriculum that is offered by the United States military service branches.

01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:05.480
That's right.

01:54:05.500 --> 01:54:07.001
This could be very misleading, I apologize.

01:54:07.021 --> 01:54:07.181
Okay.

01:54:07.461 --> 01:54:09.142
So I do think that's very misleading.

01:54:09.623 --> 01:54:21.270
And I do think that using the exact terminology of the course code, whatever that's in there, is what you should do from beginning to end on this.

01:54:22.551 --> 01:54:30.336
Lots of people toss around ROTC and these other things, but it's got to be a lot more clear than that.

01:54:30.656 --> 01:54:43.325
And if we were to leave this as JROTC period, then it would eliminate, I think, really good programs that are doing good things for students, and we don't want to do that.

01:54:43.385 --> 01:54:44.666
So you're batting zero for three.

01:54:46.728 --> 01:54:47.888
Just a little joke, just a little joke.

01:54:47.908 --> 01:54:51.871
You're out then.

01:54:51.891 --> 01:54:52.171
Great.

01:54:52.331 --> 01:54:53.572
OK, Board Member Rucker.

01:54:54.573 --> 01:55:02.778
And I'm glad to follow up with Board Member Holliday's question because the course code was going to be my particular question as well.

01:55:03.579 --> 01:55:12.485
Because I know we have already had, you and I had conversations about how CTE courses are being coded and the difficulty the department is having with capturing

01:55:12.865 --> 01:55:14.406
how districts are reporting it.

01:55:14.747 --> 01:55:27.036
So, the other part of the question I had, a lot of districts, including the district where my brother took the California Cadet Corps course, it was listed on his report card as a PE course.

01:55:27.056 --> 01:55:28.457
It wasn't even identified.

01:55:28.957 --> 01:55:30.958
as a California cadet core course.

01:55:31.358 --> 01:55:41.121
So because students can take those courses to exercise the option for PE, I'm wondering if we're also losing some of that reporting.

01:55:41.382 --> 01:55:45.103
The reason why I'm concerned about that course code is I want you to look at

01:55:45.723 --> 01:55:57.174
As you look at this chart and you look at the difference and I would expect from year one to year four that we would see an increasingly smaller number of students who would elect to choose this course of study.

01:55:57.575 --> 01:56:05.282
But I got confused when I looked at the change in enrollment between year two and three and then year three and four.

01:56:07.104 --> 01:56:08.045
If you had 240 students

01:56:11.003 --> 01:56:24.540
who met the standard in year three, who exceeded the standard in year three, where did the extra 108 students come from who met the standard in year four?

01:56:25.766 --> 01:56:27.127
So I don't understand.

01:56:27.147 --> 01:56:29.089
So there's got to be something going on.

01:56:29.229 --> 01:56:32.332
There's a ghost in the coding that's creating some confusion.

01:56:32.412 --> 01:56:40.700
I realize that's a very small concern, but that's consistent in what's reported for year four across all of the categories.

01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:44.643
So I'm a little, except for the first one, standard not met.

01:56:45.124 --> 01:56:46.045
I don't get that.

01:56:46.525 --> 01:56:52.190
So what I think it's important to note is that year three may not be their 11th grade.

01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:57.675
Three years may not be that they were enrolled in JROTC during their 11th grade year.

01:56:57.715 --> 01:57:02.099
This is at any point during their 11th grade year, we grab their Smarter Balanced scores.

01:57:02.279 --> 01:57:04.361
They may have been in JROTC for four years.

01:57:04.401 --> 01:57:05.482
They may have been in for three years.

01:57:05.502 --> 01:57:08.264
So whenever they, it's not,

01:57:08.965 --> 01:57:19.652
I think if you take it out of the context of when they were enrolled in the course versus grade 11 is the only time we offer, by law, required to offer the Smarter Balanced assessment.

01:57:19.752 --> 01:57:20.113
Got it.

01:57:20.213 --> 01:57:20.273
OK.

01:57:20.293 --> 01:57:21.494
That helps me to understand.

01:57:21.654 --> 01:57:22.014
OK.

01:57:22.734 --> 01:57:25.076
And I appreciate the comments about the course coding.

01:57:25.236 --> 01:57:26.637
And again, I apologize.

01:57:26.777 --> 01:57:30.400
We were trying to make it friendlier to folks.

01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:32.581
And it's obviously caused some confusion.

01:57:32.601 --> 01:57:34.242
And that's the first time that this has been brought up.

01:57:34.282 --> 01:57:36.564
So I do appreciate the comments.

01:57:36.604 --> 01:57:38.045
And we will take that to heart moving forward.

01:57:38.505 --> 01:57:41.866
when we bring measures to you for inclusion in the college career indicator.

01:57:42.526 --> 01:57:45.467
Yeah, I'd like you to go to the last slide.

01:57:46.607 --> 01:57:52.368
And so I think this goes back to college and or career.

01:57:53.089 --> 01:57:56.049
I think this might be a good measure for career.

01:57:56.869 --> 01:57:57.570
I'm not sure.

01:57:57.790 --> 01:57:58.410
Yeah, you're right.

01:57:58.470 --> 01:58:02.411
I'm not sure it's a good measure for college and now we're back to that

01:58:03.731 --> 01:58:06.493
Slash.

01:58:06.893 --> 01:58:18.280
So I would have a heading proposed JROTC criteria for career CCI levels.

01:58:18.741 --> 01:58:19.181
I see.

01:58:20.442 --> 01:58:22.003
Where are the math scores in here?

01:58:22.063 --> 01:58:23.263
Why just ELA?

01:58:23.604 --> 01:58:27.166
To convince me this is a college ready, I need to see some math scores.

01:58:29.357 --> 01:58:31.942
Good point, and I skipped over this.

01:58:32.302 --> 01:58:35.848
So we are only recommending this for, where does it pick up?

01:58:36.510 --> 01:58:39.855
I guess I didn't really recommend this for a career.

01:58:46.638 --> 01:58:50.799
So we are treating this as a career measure.

01:58:51.239 --> 01:59:01.021
But because in order to join the military service, you have to meet some academic standards, we are also putting in the academic standards for ELA and math.

01:59:01.581 --> 01:59:06.922
So you have to score at least level 3 on one and nearly met on the other.

01:59:07.303 --> 01:59:11.463
So you can score level 3 on ELA or level 3 on math.

01:59:11.543 --> 01:59:13.824
And then the other subject area has to be at least a level 2.

01:59:16.604 --> 01:59:16.844
Hmm.

01:59:18.666 --> 01:59:22.049
Okay.

01:59:23.791 --> 01:59:29.536
I'm a little lost, but I'm... Anybody have any comments on that?

01:59:29.596 --> 01:59:31.518
I'm confused.

01:59:33.660 --> 01:59:37.824
Well, it's both college and career because it's hooked to Smarter Balanced.

01:59:41.830 --> 01:59:55.792
I would like to go back just for a second to sort of two comments one by member holiday That these are apples and oranges and we should treat them as apples and oranges but we have to communicate in a way that's clear about it and

01:59:56.152 --> 02:00:04.820
And I just want to offer my highest compliment to our new board member on her suggestion that we call this post-secondary readiness.

02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:08.283
Because we're just hung up on is it college?

02:00:08.323 --> 02:00:08.983
Is it career?

02:00:09.043 --> 02:00:10.485
Are we sending the wrong messages?

02:00:10.905 --> 02:00:21.134
And we really need to have a very helpful subject or title for this that sends the right message.

02:00:21.593 --> 02:00:29.043
and lets users, whether it's students or parents or community members, use the information in a way that's meaningful.

02:00:29.544 --> 02:00:33.389
And I'm afraid that we have gone down rabbit holes here that we're never going to get out of.

02:00:33.409 --> 02:00:36.594
Board Member Ortiz-Lacon.

02:00:38.686 --> 02:00:40.807
Yeah, I think it's apples, oranges.

02:00:40.887 --> 02:00:44.408
It's a fruit salad, really, because there is too much going on.

02:00:44.989 --> 02:00:49.110
And when I voted for this, I voted for college and career readiness.

02:00:49.530 --> 02:00:50.951
And then it started evolving.

02:00:51.051 --> 02:00:52.552
We started seeing and or.

02:00:52.672 --> 02:00:54.072
Then we started seeing the slash.

02:00:54.452 --> 02:00:56.813
And I think that a lot of things went

02:00:58.354 --> 02:01:09.005
I don't know that we all had a common understanding and that has been a little bit of an uphill battle for me because I've asked for clarification on is this and, is it or, and at times it has been well it could be both.

02:01:09.406 --> 02:01:11.788
At times it's been no it's or.

02:01:12.809 --> 02:01:15.132
When we get to well prepared it will be and.

02:01:15.612 --> 02:01:20.738
And so I think that even if we change it to post-secondary success, which I think is

02:01:21.218 --> 02:01:28.685
perhaps more encompassing, we still need to deal with the fact that the criteria tends to be a little bit all over the place for different indicators.

02:01:29.185 --> 02:01:33.048
So I think there has to be some consistency across it.

02:01:33.168 --> 02:01:43.898
If we're saving, if we think that math needs to be valued, which I agree, but it's not consistent across indicators, then maybe we can consider making it consistent at the well-prepared level once we get there.

02:01:44.538 --> 02:02:02.945
But again, I do think that we need to standardize the way that we are giving weight to this, even if we change the title, which again would have to be a policy decision because right now we voted for a college career readiness indicator and there are very passionate camps on both what it means to be and and what it means to be or.

02:02:03.025 --> 02:02:05.166
We can't just pretend that it's one thing.

02:02:07.992 --> 02:02:08.412
Okay.

02:02:09.313 --> 02:02:09.633
I think.

02:02:10.414 --> 02:02:12.575
Yeah, let's take it.

02:02:13.015 --> 02:02:13.296
All right.

02:02:13.316 --> 02:02:15.837
Then we'll have public comment and we'll take a break.

02:02:15.957 --> 02:02:16.578
No, excuse me.

02:02:16.618 --> 02:02:17.959
We still have three more items.

02:02:18.039 --> 02:02:19.960
Yeah, I know, but we're going to take a break.

02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:23.202
I'm back.

02:02:23.362 --> 02:02:23.823
All right.

02:02:24.183 --> 02:02:25.023
Sounds good.

02:02:25.263 --> 02:02:25.784
Okay.

02:02:25.964 --> 02:02:28.866
So we will reconvene at 1040.

02:02:37.373 --> 02:02:46.269
Okay, the board will convene and we're on the second of items on the accountability system.

02:02:49.909 --> 02:02:56.335
Good morning again, President Kerr, Cindy Kazanas, the Analysis Measurement and Accountability Reporting Office Director.

02:02:56.756 --> 02:03:02.301
I have one slide left for the prior piece, and that is the one that we're not recommending to you.

02:03:02.361 --> 02:03:07.346
But I wanted to put it in a slide to talk through how we came to that conclusion.

02:03:07.746 --> 02:03:13.292
So the final one that we had in our plan for this year to bring to you was the CTE pathways with articulated courses.

02:03:13.912 --> 02:03:15.273
And we reviewed the data.

02:03:15.893 --> 02:03:20.056
And you have that information detailed in the August information memorandum.

02:03:20.176 --> 02:03:29.342
And we're not recommending it because we felt the data showed that the courses could not be treated any different than CT pathways without articulated courses.

02:03:29.882 --> 02:03:36.227
So there was no distinction between those with articulated versus without articulated.

02:03:36.267 --> 02:03:39.469
And because there's not a distinction there, we didn't feel it had

02:03:40.129 --> 02:03:40.990
merit to move forward.

02:03:41.790 --> 02:03:48.514
The college career indicator work group agreed with us as did all the other stakeholder groups that we presented to.

02:03:48.674 --> 02:03:58.259
So this is not one that is coming for recommendation but I wanted to close the loop because we did present to you four items for this year that we wanted to consider recommending approval.

02:04:00.620 --> 02:04:05.403
So that is college career indicator and I'm prepared to move on to chronic absenteeism.

02:04:07.870 --> 02:04:12.713
So chronic absenteeism data, as you know, was collected for the first time last year.

02:04:12.813 --> 02:04:19.576
We just received our second year of data about a week ago from our local educational agencies.

02:04:20.417 --> 02:04:26.500
We have conducted multiple analysis on that one year of data and determined that the data is of good quality.

02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:34.064
And to identify, we did look at it to see if there was any potential anomalies and did not find any.

02:04:34.884 --> 02:04:40.386
The analysis also indicated that we felt confident that we could put it in for the dashboard.

02:04:40.826 --> 02:04:43.526
So what you will see today is a methodology.

02:04:43.566 --> 02:04:45.487
This is a two-parter methodology.

02:04:45.547 --> 02:04:53.649
We will come back when we have completed our analysis and run simulations for proposing cut scores for that second year of data in November.

02:04:54.049 --> 02:04:59.651
So similar to College Career Indicator, we're working on that data now to propose cut scores again for November.

02:05:00.291 --> 02:05:10.995
So I thought it was important to take a step back because when we talk about chronic absenteeism data, the student has already potentially left the school or the district in which they were affiliated with.

02:05:11.996 --> 02:05:18.358
And a student is determined chronically absent if they miss 10% or more days of their expected attendance.

02:05:18.738 --> 02:05:20.879
So what is the purpose of this data collection?

02:05:21.299 --> 02:05:28.481
Because that is a lot of schooling, that is a lot of lost instruction, and these students probably are most vulnerable for dropping out.

02:05:28.921 --> 02:05:35.102
So I like this slide because it shows you what this data can be useful for at the school district level and then at the state level.

02:05:35.523 --> 02:05:36.563
So at the school district level,

02:05:37.483 --> 02:05:40.405
This statewide data collection was never meant to be an early warning system.

02:05:40.666 --> 02:05:47.151
That is something that is meant to be on the districts and on the schools use of daily attendance.

02:05:47.511 --> 02:06:01.703
There was a proposal several years ago that we do do a statewide attendance data collection and in fact that measure, I can't remember whether or not it just didn't make it through the process or if it was ultimately vetoed, but we don't have that in place.

02:06:02.003 --> 02:06:07.725
All we receive from our data collection is how many days a student was expected to attend and how many days they attended.

02:06:08.085 --> 02:06:08.925
That's it.

02:06:09.425 --> 02:06:10.986
And this is after the fact, right?

02:06:11.006 --> 02:06:13.166
This is after a year's worth of being in school.

02:06:13.526 --> 02:06:16.507
And we're not reporting out on it until three to four months later.

02:06:16.587 --> 02:06:18.928
So what is the actionable data at the school level?

02:06:19.288 --> 02:06:24.890
Well, they should be using, again, their daily attendance to identify and address issues regarding attendance issues.

02:06:25.290 --> 02:06:29.391
It's California state law that students attend school.

02:06:30.291 --> 02:06:35.475
The data at the chronic absenteeism level, though, can be used to look at trends statewide.

02:06:35.575 --> 02:06:40.358
So looking at schools that may require assistance in addressing attendance problems early.

02:06:40.758 --> 02:06:50.465
And in fact, we do have a report in the student-level data system in CALPADS that shows throughout the year how school districts are

02:06:51.906 --> 02:06:59.713
how students are progressing as far as, again, number of days they were supposed to show up versus number of days they actually showed up.

02:07:00.414 --> 02:07:05.178
And then finally, school districts are required, this has been a part of the local control and accountability plan from day one.

02:07:05.698 --> 02:07:06.919
This has been on that.

02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:11.142
They have to set goals with specific actions about chronic absenteeism.

02:07:11.522 --> 02:07:20.167
And I neglected to mention that Superintendent Tarlekson just reminded us via a news release that September is Attendance Awareness Month.

02:07:20.327 --> 02:07:24.589
So we are ripe in talking about this topic today.

02:07:25.510 --> 02:07:29.334
Finally, at the state level, what is the purpose of the chronic absenteeism piece?

02:07:29.594 --> 02:07:41.287
So for the first time, we were able to report out on this data through our data portal, which is DataQuest, and provided that information at the school, district, and county level, as well as the statewide level.

02:07:42.148 --> 02:07:57.275
I have to tell you that using that publicly reported information, Attendance Works, partnering with UC Davis, put together a very interactive storyboard through using geographic information system that is very powerful.

02:07:57.695 --> 02:08:04.178
So that is, I think, an automatic success of somebody's used the publicly available data and they've created actionable

02:08:05.699 --> 02:08:17.867
things for for districts to do and they have an action plan behind it because there are advocates out there that are steeped in this issue and most other states are actually Ahead of us on this issue.

02:08:18.047 --> 02:08:28.794
We are very late in this data collection piece So finally, we of course have adopted you adopted the chronic absenteeism as a performance indicator back in July of 2016 and then of course our

02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:35.362
Every Student Succeeds Act State Plan requires states to report it.

02:08:35.422 --> 02:08:37.583
And we, of course, quoted it in our state plan.

02:08:38.243 --> 02:08:44.986
And to that point, there's been some questions that have been raised about why the recommendation is just for the K level.

02:08:45.326 --> 02:08:55.511
And so before I go into that, I just wanted to show you at a glance what measures that have been adopted and their applicable levels, grade levels, grade spans.

02:08:55.851 --> 02:08:57.872
So if I'm in an elementary school district, you will see,

02:08:59.894 --> 02:09:04.320
three different measures that you'll receive performance categories on.

02:09:04.600 --> 02:09:10.127
And keep in mind that English language arts and mathematics are separated out on the dashboard, so it's actually two measures for that first one.

02:09:10.467 --> 02:09:13.351
They'd see chronic absenteeism as well as suspension.

02:09:14.312 --> 02:09:19.920
For high school, we're going to be picking up academic with your decision to add it into the SSA plan.

02:09:20.461 --> 02:09:24.065
And then college career, graduation rate, and suspension.

02:09:24.406 --> 02:09:31.055
So the balance that you see there is that there is more measures actually for high school than there are for elementary.

02:09:33.629 --> 02:09:44.338
With that in mind, the approved plan, the ESSA state plan that you all approved on multiple occasions, included the chronic absenteeism rate as grades K through 8.

02:09:45.259 --> 02:09:48.521
We will continue to report high school data on DataQuest.

02:09:48.562 --> 02:09:52.084
That is, DataQuest is always going to be a standalone reporting functionality.

02:09:52.104 --> 02:09:53.506
That is the purpose of that system.

02:09:54.126 --> 02:09:55.627
For accountability, though,

02:09:56.408 --> 02:10:02.152
We believe that graduation rate and the college career indicator shows the impact of chronic absenteeism.

02:10:02.252 --> 02:10:05.474
If they don't come to school, they are not likely to graduate.

02:10:05.935 --> 02:10:10.098
So we know that by the graduation rates that we have seen and the dropouts.

02:10:10.338 --> 02:10:18.864
And although they've decreased over the years, those measures still show that we don't have 100% graduation rate at the statewide level.

02:10:20.791 --> 02:10:26.817
So with that in mind, we did a survey of other states.

02:10:26.877 --> 02:10:34.484
As I said, many of them are ahead of us simply because we weren't able to put this into our data collection system until recently.

02:10:34.904 --> 02:10:37.987
And so looking at what kind of methodologies they use to incorporate this.

02:10:38.467 --> 02:10:42.471
And so we came up with two that we have now run the data through.

02:10:42.851 --> 02:10:53.018
The first being that we included students enrolled in at least 31 instructional days and we assigned them the same weight to each student who met the chronic absenteeism criteria.

02:10:53.299 --> 02:11:00.544
Again, expected days if they have been absent at least 10% of instructional days that they were expected to be there.

02:11:01.264 --> 02:11:04.907
The second methodology assigns different weights to chronically absent students.

02:11:05.367 --> 02:11:11.291
Students enrolled 50% or less of instructional days would be assigned a proportional weight.

02:11:11.932 --> 02:11:17.176
So for methodology one, you can see the mean absenteeism rates for LEAs is at 8.7% and 8.9%.

02:11:17.256 --> 02:11:19.557
And for methodology two, it's slightly higher at 9.4% and 9.7%.

02:11:27.145 --> 02:11:42.827
When we discussed this information with our technical design group and others and stakeholders, and I think it was a very rich discussion at the California Petitions Advisory Group, but more because of terminology.

02:11:43.368 --> 02:11:47.594
We really walked them down a road of trying to understand how the data was collected.

02:11:47.995 --> 02:11:55.006
And unfortunately, that got them off on a side road, on a journey that we took to heart.

02:11:55.667 --> 02:11:58.391
So they didn't get through, I think,

02:11:59.392 --> 02:12:01.893
as rich of a discussion as they could have had on the methodology piece.

02:12:01.934 --> 02:12:07.076
But there was support for this methodology from the California Petitions Advisory Group and others.

02:12:07.217 --> 02:12:12.239
And one of the main reasons is it's easier to communicate this methodology to the public.

02:12:12.299 --> 02:12:17.282
And so both of them are valid and reliable ways to measure chronic absenteeism.

02:12:17.683 --> 02:12:27.028
But the department is recommending that the state board approve the first methodology based on minimum number enrollment of 31 instructional days for the calculation of the chronic absenteeism indicator.

02:12:28.857 --> 02:12:30.480
So with that, I will turn it back to you, President.

02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:31.642
Technical questions.

02:12:32.082 --> 02:12:35.809
Board member Strauss.

02:12:37.410 --> 02:12:44.214
So Cindy, first of all, I know you guys have been working really, really hard on all these data runs and ways to approach it.

02:12:44.614 --> 02:12:52.778
I think we need a clarification on the history of how we got from K-12 chronic absenteeism to K-8.

02:12:53.459 --> 02:13:01.363
And just for a couple of comments is that I know you addressed it by saying chronic absenteeism of students not in high school, they're not going to be

02:13:02.323 --> 02:13:10.551
likely to graduate, and obviously districts have data that they should be using a lot ongoing, and this is a report at the end of the year.

02:13:11.131 --> 02:13:22.020
But I think having led schools at elementary, middle, and high school, it becomes far more serious as kids get older, and obviously counselors and administrators need to be following that.

02:13:22.161 --> 02:13:28.926
But I think there's quite a surprise, by the way, among some board members and the public and school districts about,

02:13:29.847 --> 02:13:44.342
how it ended up going to K-8, which I believe aligned more when we were doing our ESSA indicators, but why we can't or are not planning at this point, the recommendation is to not include it in high school.

02:13:44.382 --> 02:13:51.050
So just a little history and discussion, I think just would be helpful to clarify in the whole conversation.

02:13:52.375 --> 02:13:53.296
I'd be happy to do so.

02:13:53.396 --> 02:14:00.360
So the application of the grade span has been something that this board voted on in July of 2016.

02:14:00.420 --> 02:14:03.621
The grade spans were included in a chart.

02:14:03.982 --> 02:14:06.643
And I wanted to make sure I referenced back to it.

02:14:06.663 --> 02:14:09.725
So it's attachment four in that item.

02:14:10.145 --> 02:14:17.710
I think because we have not had data to share with you, this indicator has not had the data

02:14:18.610 --> 02:14:20.811
sort of light shined on it until recently.

02:14:21.232 --> 02:14:30.458
And so these kinds of conversations about why are we changing our minds, it's not changing our minds, I just don't think we've been as out in front about the K-8 piece of it.

02:14:30.558 --> 02:14:37.782
But it has been in the state plan since the first iteration back in September that you all voted on as a K-8 measure.

02:14:38.843 --> 02:14:53.747
That said, one of the interesting things we heard when we talked to stakeholders after the board item was publicly posted was that there was an inference because we included the data reporting on the dashboard currently.

02:14:53.887 --> 02:14:55.668
Right now, if you were going to go to chronic absenteeism,

02:14:56.008 --> 02:14:59.750
for any school that has a dashboard, it takes you to DataQuest.

02:14:59.830 --> 02:15:04.093
And so I think there was an inference that that would be what the indicator would be applied to.

02:15:04.793 --> 02:15:17.500
So that is a lesson learned on our part that perhaps this whole inference of data being posted, even though it's just raw data, like we would do, for example, for LPAC.

02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:21.302
And LPAC is different because it is applied to the entire grade spans.

02:15:22.723 --> 02:15:32.006
And I realize that I missed the state indicators by grade span, but of course the English LP would be on here as well.

02:15:32.766 --> 02:15:34.907
That was my oversight.

02:15:34.927 --> 02:15:35.687
I apologize for that.

02:15:36.127 --> 02:15:39.228
But that is something that we've learned.

02:15:39.488 --> 02:15:52.662
And I think that is going to be a tension as I show you the new redesign of the dashboard, is how much information is important to explain, you know, why is certain measures being only applied to certain grade spans?

02:15:53.363 --> 02:15:55.886
And so this is one of them that, you know, stands out.

02:15:56.286 --> 02:16:01.532
The graduation rate in college careers seem a little more intuitive because it's usually applied, you're thinking about high schools.

02:16:03.464 --> 02:16:26.484
So to follow up, to finish out, we have, you know, this has been on the table from 2016, in which, again, you all voted on, and we see college career and the graduation rate in lieu of chronic absenteeism, that is what we see it being used for, is attendance as well or academic performance.

02:16:28.446 --> 02:16:28.666
Yes.

02:16:29.467 --> 02:16:30.548
Did that answer your question?

02:16:32.231 --> 02:16:39.798
Clarify, but I have a little for a few more comments after my fellow colleagues comment board member holiday I don't know.

02:16:40.298 --> 02:16:57.254
I don't remember the 2016 vote But I'd like to revote Because I do think that the chronic absenteeism if you are collecting the data as you say is there I don't I do think that it should be reported and Mr. Sapp is going to

02:16:57.994 --> 02:17:05.018
Explain how I'm, but I do think having it on the dashboard makes sense to me for high school, middle and high.

02:17:05.658 --> 02:17:09.240
David Sapp, Assistant Legal Counsel with State Board of Education.

02:17:09.300 --> 02:17:19.366
Just one point of clarification due to the interaction between the actions the board takes on the dashboard as well as the federal state plan for the Every Student Sees Act.

02:17:20.046 --> 02:17:34.871
You all may recall from the board meeting in July, there was an extensive discussion about a federal requirement under the federal law about the overall weighting of indicators that are used at the school level for federal accountability purposes.

02:17:34.951 --> 02:17:39.552
There's actually a requirement that the, I'm going to use the shorthand of calling them academic measures.

02:17:39.592 --> 02:17:41.993
They're actually not defined that way in the federal law, but

02:17:42.554 --> 02:17:48.738
the overall weighting of academic measures must be greater in the aggregate for the academic versus non-academic.

02:17:49.338 --> 02:17:57.043
Because of the way Congress wrote the law, chronic absence cannot count as a academic measure at the high school level.

02:17:57.263 --> 02:18:02.587
It can, and the federal government approved its use as an academic measure at the K-8 level.

02:18:03.607 --> 02:18:06.969
strong research and evidence to support that approval.

02:18:07.029 --> 02:18:14.595
It was included in the state plan, which is how predictive chronic absences at early grades of future academic performance for young learners.

02:18:15.355 --> 02:18:21.219
So right now, the balance of indicators at the high school level is close.

02:18:22.020 --> 02:18:32.527
Essentially, we had a very extensive back and forth with the federal US Department of Education staff in the course of negotiating the final terms of that plan.

02:18:33.888 --> 02:18:37.212
And this is one of the areas that we did spend some time discussing with them.

02:18:37.652 --> 02:18:45.021
And they ultimately were satisfied that the weighting of indicators at the high school level under the approved plan meets that requirement.

02:18:45.542 --> 02:18:47.724
If we were to add chronic absence at the high school level,

02:18:49.506 --> 02:18:52.188
It is my view that I do not believe it would anymore.

02:18:52.308 --> 02:19:01.395
So I think that's something the board would need to consider, is the use of the indicator in the dashboard versus whether it could be used at the school level for school identification.

02:19:01.896 --> 02:19:06.579
There would be a choice either of having to go and argue for a waiver with the federal government.

02:19:06.599 --> 02:19:07.720
That might not be granted.

02:19:07.780 --> 02:19:14.285
This is a pretty significant issue that they emphasized throughout the process as being very important in their view of what Congress intended.

02:19:15.666 --> 02:19:20.972
versus the option of the board could, of course, approve something in the dashboard and not use it for federal purposes.

02:19:21.152 --> 02:19:30.103
But I think one thing that I think staff has heard from the very beginning is the desire to not have different indicators apply, one for federal and one for state.

02:19:31.023 --> 02:19:38.045
One final thing that I will add, Cindy was actually out on parental leave at the time, but I was here during some of these discussions.

02:19:38.505 --> 02:19:51.987
I believe actually board member Burr at the very earliest discussion of the indicators for the evaluation rubrics, which is now reflected in the dashboard, was the goal and the board took action about a concise set of indicators.

02:19:52.287 --> 02:19:59.549
And at the time the terminology was different, but a concise set of indicators to be used in the evaluation rubrics for accountability purposes under LCFF.

02:20:00.189 --> 02:20:18.400
So I think that's another thing the board should be aware of and keep in mind in looking at the overall number and balance of indicators is that original goal in adopting the rubrics was to maintain a concise set of indicators that met the federal requirements because that was in the context of knowing what ESSA required at the time.

02:20:18.840 --> 02:20:30.849
There were a series of information memos that were posted and a number of items that were successively discussed through the course of January through September of 2016 when the board actually formally adopted the evaluation rubrics.

02:20:31.429 --> 02:20:42.237
And so the question of adding new indicators, you know, there's in the broader context the question of revisiting the original goal of maintaining a concise set of indicators for accountability purpose under the local control funding formula.

02:20:46.360 --> 02:20:46.600
Go ahead.

02:20:47.031 --> 02:20:48.792
I just want to finish up with one last comment.

02:20:50.013 --> 02:20:50.333
Thank you.

02:20:50.353 --> 02:20:52.734
And I didn't really understand a lot of that.

02:20:53.054 --> 02:20:55.676
But I understand how it has to fit together.

02:20:55.696 --> 02:20:56.296
I apologize.

02:20:56.717 --> 02:20:58.357
But just one other thing.

02:20:58.437 --> 02:21:04.221
Whether or not chronic absenteeism ends up on the dashboard for high school and middle school or not is another story.

02:21:04.661 --> 02:21:06.522
But if it doesn't.

02:21:08.503 --> 02:21:23.759
Think what efforts are being made to make sure that school districts and and schools are taking very Serious and close look at this data on a regular basis in your purpose for chronic absenteeism data

02:21:24.764 --> 02:21:28.965
you state very clearly the first statement is not an early warning system.

02:21:29.465 --> 02:21:38.468
Well, that, I'm not sure that's necessarily how we want to start off, how we communicate with schools about how important this information is.

02:21:38.568 --> 02:21:46.210
Instead of saying it doesn't do this, I think we should start with this is something that's really helpful, could potentially be really helpful to you.

02:21:46.770 --> 02:21:48.951
For example, in the next one you say,

02:21:51.711 --> 02:21:57.637
Another third bullet point you said addressing attendance problems early in the school year, right?

02:21:59.617 --> 02:22:02.239
to identify and address emerging attendance.

02:22:02.779 --> 02:22:09.924
And in other words, words like repeating early and emerging, that to me is sort of an early warning system sort of language there.

02:22:10.564 --> 02:22:26.494
And the fact is, I think schools and districts can use this information early on to identify where they're having issues with certain subgroups, with individual students and all the rest, and that can be really helpful to them.

02:22:28.041 --> 02:22:45.580
Once again, whether or not the ESSA plan and our plan work this out for the dashboard is not as important to me as being able to have the department communicate very effectively with schools and school districts how important this data is and how they can use it.

02:22:47.117 --> 02:22:55.128
If I can clarify, President Kirst, and I appreciate the feedback on how to start with a positive versus a negative.

02:22:56.189 --> 02:22:58.593
As a data person, I should know that a little better.

02:23:04.160 --> 02:23:05.722
what was the quality of the data we were getting.

02:23:05.843 --> 02:23:11.370
Because our student-level data system doesn't require districts to enter information in every single day.

02:23:11.550 --> 02:23:14.334
We only have three certifications that they have.

02:23:14.475 --> 02:23:17.679
And the third certification is the end of year, which is when we grab this data.

02:23:18.100 --> 02:23:20.082
That's why it's so important that our local

02:23:20.843 --> 02:23:26.230
educational agencies use their student information systems locally, their daily attendance locally to do this.

02:23:26.330 --> 02:23:36.301
And in fact, Superintendent Torlakson's press release dated the September 4th of this year reminds us of chronic absenteeism.

02:23:36.321 --> 02:23:39.265
I think what it does is it adds another level of insight

02:23:39.885 --> 02:23:42.487
again, on a statewide level, because we've never been able to do that before.

02:23:42.547 --> 02:23:48.332
So it's really given a statewide perspective of where we have pockets of students that are chronically absent.

02:23:48.352 --> 02:23:58.220
The other thing that Attendance Works, when we talked to them early on, very strongly advocated for us to do in DataQuest was to have a filter for just kindergarten.

02:23:58.640 --> 02:24:03.203
They said that kindergarten is the first piece of your student's entry into school.

02:24:03.244 --> 02:24:04.845
And if they don't show up to kindergarten,

02:24:05.205 --> 02:24:09.568
They may be chronically absent as grade ones through three.

02:24:09.628 --> 02:24:12.590
And so we do have the grade span filters available in DataQuest.

02:24:13.190 --> 02:24:14.571
The dashboard is not meant to do that.

02:24:14.611 --> 02:24:17.613
The dashboard doesn't isolate grade spans, right?

02:24:17.653 --> 02:24:23.017
It looks at a school, and it doesn't tell you within that school, oh, grade one did better than grade two.

02:24:23.077 --> 02:24:27.860
That's going to be, again, on DataQuest as raw data, not applying the methodology that we are using.

02:24:28.840 --> 02:24:39.527
for the accountability system but I appreciate that and I do have to acknowledge my colleague Gordon Jackson has a great staff who has spent a lot of time on this.

02:24:39.567 --> 02:24:44.190
They have an amazing statewide presence with the school attendance review boards.

02:24:44.310 --> 02:24:57.618
The state SARB does a great deal of work on this and I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge that we do have technical experts here in this building that help districts on a regular basis to reduce chronic absenteeism

02:24:57.978 --> 02:24:59.079
and to work on attendance.

02:24:59.139 --> 02:25:07.105
And in fact, there are model SARBs, model attendance districts all over California that the superintendent recognizes on an annual basis.

02:25:07.445 --> 02:25:13.470
But for the accountability purposes, we just get this sliver of information and it's really too late, right?

02:25:13.510 --> 02:25:14.771
This is not an early warning system.

02:25:14.791 --> 02:25:16.192
This is really after the fact.

02:25:16.252 --> 02:25:18.634
And some of these kids may have dropped out by then.

02:25:18.654 --> 02:25:22.637
And so that's just trying to provide a little bit more insight into the data.

02:25:23.578 --> 02:25:27.581
We're a member of ALDEZ.

02:25:29.031 --> 02:25:35.095
So I appreciate that the chronic absenteeism data that we have is really lagging, a lagging indicator, right?

02:25:35.155 --> 02:25:37.196
Because it's over and it's done with.

02:25:37.376 --> 02:25:42.319
And when we think about DataQuest, it's also a lagging indicator, but we can disaggregate.

02:25:42.599 --> 02:25:45.741
And one of my comments was about kindergarten, because it's not compensatory.

02:25:46.101 --> 02:25:51.584
And it is the largest, when you look at district profiles, the largest offender, if you will, of not having kids in school.

02:25:51.604 --> 02:25:54.266
So for me, that one recommendation is somehow or another to make that

02:25:55.987 --> 02:25:57.787
a grade level that is required.

02:25:57.928 --> 02:26:01.950
I mean, I just think that that's got to be out there because that's one of the things that the data is telling us.

02:26:01.990 --> 02:26:04.831
So how we use this data moving forward is going to be important.

02:26:05.492 --> 02:26:11.154
Today in Riverside County, in fact, they have a countywide conference on chronic absenteeism.

02:26:11.194 --> 02:26:17.458
So I think what the conversations that we're having and as we look at just a K-8 narrow window, at least it's creating

02:26:18.699 --> 02:26:26.427
chatter and really intentional bringing together people to see what they can do in concert with DAs and SARB and SART and all of those things.

02:26:26.447 --> 02:26:28.449
So I think the processes are in good place.

02:26:30.611 --> 02:26:36.677
I do feel though that last year there was the release of reports that came out every district and it was a K-12.

02:26:37.578 --> 02:26:50.633
So when I have conversations with different principals and district level folks and said, oh, it's only going to be K-8, because I do remember originally when we were looking at what would be an elementary, because I was a K-8 district at the time, I paid a lot of attention to it.

02:26:50.653 --> 02:26:55.960
But then because that report came out last year and it wasn't from, you know, CDE, but it was a

02:26:56.520 --> 02:27:00.562
you know, we were ranked across the county and, you know, how was your chronic absenteeism?

02:27:00.622 --> 02:27:03.684
Everyone felt like it was going to be a K-12 at that point.

02:27:04.044 --> 02:27:11.828
So I think that there's going to be people who are going to be disappointed that we're not looking at it as a K-12 indicator.

02:27:11.848 --> 02:27:16.890
Board Member Ortiz-Lacombe.

02:27:18.351 --> 02:27:18.691
Thank you.

02:27:20.888 --> 02:27:27.531
One of the letters from LPI referenced that 34 other state plans included this indicator as K-12.

02:27:27.991 --> 02:27:41.538
So if ESSA is the piece that is prohibiting us from looking at this as a K-12 indicator, we ought to figure out how 34 other states managed to include the K-12 chronic absenteeism as K-12.

02:27:41.798 --> 02:27:44.580
Let me finish, Dave, before you approach.

02:27:45.220 --> 02:27:51.243
I was like, there should be music sound effects as you're walking up.

02:27:52.363 --> 02:28:04.089
So, and I'm glad to know that we are really truly looking to this coherent system of accountability because I am sure that I will have comments about that as we look at the data dashboard.

02:28:05.189 --> 02:28:12.872
We are also leading up to some rounds of addendums that will be submitted in November for the ESSA State Plan because some things have changed on our end.

02:28:13.413 --> 02:28:15.814
And so this could be something that we could add.

02:28:16.154 --> 02:28:21.396
Now they could always say no, but at least we know that 34 other states have done it.

02:28:22.176 --> 02:28:30.140
And so we should also look to include this as one of our addendums that we're looking to submit in November for the ESSA State Plan.

02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:35.647
Because I agree, I think that this is something that's critical and it looks different from graduation.

02:28:35.667 --> 02:28:42.617
I know there's some correlation, but those are not telling us what's happening in the secondary levels or in high school.

02:28:47.247 --> 02:28:55.474
So the board obviously can amend the state plan and any actions the board takes over the next, this meeting and the next meeting could be reflected in an amended plan.

02:28:56.494 --> 02:29:07.583
I think one issue, and this is from the work on the federal ESSA plan, our state plan is quite different from most other states, not all but most, in the fact that we don't have a composite index.

02:29:08.504 --> 02:29:12.046
that we have each indicator is treated equally with equal weight.

02:29:12.686 --> 02:29:29.014
And therefore, most, based on my review of state plans, which is not comprehensive, most states that have factored in, they give quarter, half, 8% weighting sometimes to some of these indicators relative to others, which is a decision in a direction this board has not gone up until now.

02:29:29.954 --> 02:29:42.023
So I, you know, I think this is, you know, would be a much broader discussion as opposed to taking action on a specific indicator because the implications of this overall system as a whole would be very profound.

02:29:42.884 --> 02:29:53.171
It would impact the criteria the board's already adopted for LCFF as well as the criteria for school identification under federal Every Student Sees Act.

02:29:53.211 --> 02:29:58.335
All the modeling that's been presented to the board up until now in terms of the impact analysis and school identification.

02:29:58.935 --> 02:30:06.621
would be very different from what it would ultimately be if the board were to make substantial changes to the indicators that are included in the grades to which they apply.

02:30:07.061 --> 02:30:20.472
So I think all the actions the board took up until now in developing the state plan, we wouldn't really know sort of if that would be the baseline going forward if we're talking about major changes in terms of the composition of the indicators that are included in our state plan.

02:30:20.592 --> 02:30:25.636
But that is definitely something if the board so directs that staff would be able to take back.

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:31.862
Wait, Dave, the criteria for identification under ESSA is only based on academic indicators.

02:30:33.502 --> 02:30:36.503
That's not what the law provides.

02:30:36.603 --> 02:30:45.806
The law provides that the identification of schools has to be based on all the approved indicators and that at the, what I'm, again, the shorthand is academic indicators.

02:30:45.826 --> 02:30:53.169
They're spelled out in statute as actually the two subject matter assessments, English language arts and math, at the high school level graduation rate.

02:30:53.869 --> 02:30:57.771
English learner progress, those are what I'm calling a shorthand academic indicators.

02:30:58.111 --> 02:31:00.392
The other indicators have to have substantial weight.

02:31:00.853 --> 02:31:06.436
But in the aggregate, the academic indicators have to have much greater weight in the aggregate than all the indicators together.

02:31:06.876 --> 02:31:10.858
But actually, the law provides that all the indicators must be using the identification of schools.

02:31:11.478 --> 02:31:14.880
Okay, I'll have to look at that because I know it was for the summative but not for identification.

02:31:15.816 --> 02:31:24.323
And I guess another point of context that Mr. Sapp brought up, we are one of 14 states in the country that are non-summative.

02:31:24.603 --> 02:31:37.574
And in fact, our peer group, the Council of Chief State School Officers, has put together a group because we are on an island of our own of non-summative states.

02:31:37.634 --> 02:31:38.475
And so we've actually

02:31:38.915 --> 02:31:48.360
had about five phone calls with those other states, which includes New York, Pennsylvania, trying to think of some of the other, Maine has presented as well.

02:31:48.400 --> 02:31:53.202
So those are just who we are in company with nationally.

02:31:55.011 --> 02:31:55.751
Board Member Sun.

02:31:56.292 --> 02:31:58.913
I just have a question about the data collected.

02:31:59.513 --> 02:32:07.376
Cindy, remind me if we, in collecting the information about students, do we also ask for reasons why?

02:32:07.396 --> 02:32:20.101
Or, and I'm referring to the fact that we have students who are increasingly have health issues, are hospitalized for one reason or another.

02:32:20.601 --> 02:32:36.027
In just looking at my own schools I went through, because of this topic, I went through and looked at 40% of our high school students who are chronically absent, it's because of hospitalization, they're on an IEP, anxiety.

02:32:36.107 --> 02:32:41.189
There's all kinds of very legitimate reasons, not just because they're not coming to school.

02:32:41.449 --> 02:32:42.550
And a lot of them on

02:32:44.070 --> 02:32:45.411
on IEPs and 504s.

02:32:45.731 --> 02:32:54.917
And then with our K-8, it's about 30% of those students who are chronically absent are due to chronic illnesses or something to that effect.

02:32:55.257 --> 02:32:57.538
So do we have any kind of information on that?

02:32:59.659 --> 02:33:05.641
And I realize that you're operating a charter school, which is a little different than a district.

02:33:05.781 --> 02:33:12.823
And a lot of districts, they actually have a district program that students are transferred to for home hospital.

02:33:13.203 --> 02:33:15.624
And in fact, there's a piece of legislation that has gone through

02:33:16.744 --> 02:33:19.826
talking about that related to home hospitals.

02:33:20.246 --> 02:33:29.072
So there are pockets of this, and I think actually in Oakland has been one of the main points because they have a very well-regarded children's hospital.

02:33:29.433 --> 02:33:36.057
So there becomes these students that move from all over the state to stay at these hospitals for months at a time.

02:33:36.077 --> 02:33:38.939
And so how are they counted against the school?

02:33:39.099 --> 02:33:41.240
That's why they have these programs set up.

02:33:41.741 --> 02:33:46.564
But Jenny can definitely talk you through how we looked at that information specifically.

02:33:47.184 --> 02:33:52.028
So there is a way to report in CALPADS if students are participating in a home hospital program.

02:33:52.488 --> 02:33:59.313
And if they are participating in a home hospital program, we are not including them in our calculations for chronic absenteeism.

02:33:59.773 --> 02:34:03.196
But they must be reported that way in order for us to exclude them.

02:34:09.811 --> 02:34:10.151
Thank you.

02:34:10.912 --> 02:34:11.832
So just a couple things.

02:34:12.092 --> 02:34:28.844
I do want to kind of reaffirm something that Mr. Sapp said that this does go back to our very first conversation or one of our very first conversations about how many indicators are we going to have and how do we, as much as I hate to say it, align it with the federal government.

02:34:29.464 --> 02:34:34.486
so that we don't have multiple indicators counting for one system and not the other.

02:34:34.606 --> 02:34:37.087
So that's how this chart really came about.

02:34:37.107 --> 02:34:45.170
And it also reflects the balance, as Cindy said so articulately, between elementary and high school.

02:34:45.290 --> 02:34:49.972
And left on their own, almost all the indicators would be high school, because they're a lot easier to measure.

02:34:50.392 --> 02:34:53.773
And as you'll recall, just as a little side comment here,

02:34:54.233 --> 02:34:56.675
We've also wanted to talk about high school readiness.

02:34:56.976 --> 02:35:03.321
Can we get an indicator at a lower level that will predict whether or not students will be successful in high school?

02:35:03.341 --> 02:35:07.125
But again, to try to balance out the way these indicators are going.

02:35:07.645 --> 02:35:12.970
So just by way of background, I do want to reaffirm what Dave said, and I agree with him.

02:35:14.451 --> 02:35:20.697
The other thing just about chronic absenteeism, and Cindy touched on this when we had our liaison call in just a minute ago,

02:35:22.198 --> 02:35:23.839
It's a lagging indicator.

02:35:23.879 --> 02:35:26.141
It's just telling you what has happened in the past.

02:35:26.321 --> 02:35:30.863
The issue about student attendance is squarely a local issue.

02:35:31.423 --> 02:35:35.206
And not only that, but we have all kinds of programs in place.

02:35:35.806 --> 02:35:39.108
In my view, chronic absenteeism is a fancy word for truancy.

02:35:39.768 --> 02:35:48.755
We have had truancy programs in place from the get-go to say, if you have children who are having a hard time getting to school, we're here to help you.

02:35:49.096 --> 02:35:51.258
We're here to help make sure those kids get there.

02:35:51.698 --> 02:36:01.826
So I think we're having a fascinating conversation about data that's not necessarily linked to actually programmatic supports for students who don't attend school.

02:36:02.366 --> 02:36:08.992
So I just want to put that out there because I think it's easy to get hung up in, oh my gosh, we want this data to be so precise and somehow,

02:36:09.392 --> 02:36:11.574
it's going to change behavior at the local level.

02:36:12.175 --> 02:36:13.456
That's exactly backwards.

02:36:13.536 --> 02:36:19.262
It has to be at the local level to start with and attended to on every single day.

02:36:19.362 --> 02:36:26.929
So I just want to say that I support the calculation, the recommendation, and I support the inclusion for K-8.

02:36:28.010 --> 02:36:38.857
and that the high school issue about, I'm gonna call it truancy, is really closely, if not identically correlated to graduation rate and CCI.

02:36:38.897 --> 02:36:43.060
So I think it's taken care of without adding yet another measurement there.

02:36:44.206 --> 02:36:45.187
Thank you, Member Byrne.

02:36:45.207 --> 02:37:01.882
I just wanted to follow up on that comment because, as Cindy Kazanas has mentioned a number of times, this data is available on DataQuest and we should not underestimate the data that is made public through DataQuest.

02:37:02.623 --> 02:37:09.225
We publicized suspension rates for three straight years before it was put into an accountability system.

02:37:09.545 --> 02:37:14.747
And we saw a dramatic decrease in suspensions by simply sunshining the data.

02:37:15.247 --> 02:37:16.708
So we shouldn't underestimate that.

02:37:17.428 --> 02:37:29.332
And let me suggest to you that if there are suggestions that you have for us putting other data up on DataQuest that you think might encourage the right drivers here,

02:37:30.752 --> 02:37:33.753
to make change, then we can certainly put that in the queue.

02:37:35.133 --> 02:37:39.354
Yeah, but if the board wants to pursue this, I think member Burr's comment is good.

02:37:39.434 --> 02:37:46.616
I remember in the prior board, we spent a lot of time with student, the SAR boards, Students Attendance Review boards.

02:37:47.536 --> 02:37:53.418
This is, you know, there's an indicator and then there's a whole bunch of other legislation and local boards.

02:37:54.241 --> 02:38:00.812
If we want to, you know, we might get into this more holistically rather than just the indicator as the policy thing.

02:38:00.953 --> 02:38:02.475
And it's probably something we had to look at.

02:38:03.778 --> 02:38:04.298
Next is...

02:38:07.765 --> 02:38:09.166
I think it's been covered.

02:38:09.467 --> 02:38:11.209
I think there are a lot of programs.

02:38:11.749 --> 02:38:13.491
Member Holliday started the discussion.

02:38:14.632 --> 02:38:19.397
Maybe we'll compile a set of those programs that are taking place.

02:38:19.437 --> 02:38:20.678
And you just mentioned it, Member Burr.

02:38:21.179 --> 02:38:23.661
There are a lot of programs and the data is driven attention.

02:38:24.161 --> 02:38:25.923
The Riverside Workshop, just as an example,

02:38:27.324 --> 02:38:32.206
driven attention to the data and schools compare each other's absenteeism.

02:38:32.266 --> 02:38:39.968
And within counties, the county superintendents are taking a role to try to convene their LEAs to look at how they could help.

02:38:40.369 --> 02:38:44.370
The other driver, you know, coincidentally is the money.

02:38:44.790 --> 02:38:48.251
If you get those students back in school, you get more ADA.

02:38:48.751 --> 02:38:53.593
So that's also changed the picture as administrators are looking at that data.

02:38:54.534 --> 02:38:57.377
They're looking at dollar signs that they're not taking in as well.

02:39:02.893 --> 02:39:14.395
So let me begin by saying it's axiomatic that student attendance is very important, not only to school student success, but to the work that schools can do when the students get there.

02:39:14.435 --> 02:39:25.638
So the decision to include or not to include all grade spans in the accountability system does not rest on whether or not we believe absenteeism is important.

02:39:26.258 --> 02:39:39.126
But I think we're at a point now that our accountability system is reaching, this is a real inflection point for us on the policy work that we've been doing on the development of this accountability system.

02:39:39.506 --> 02:39:51.093
And we're beginning to see this work have some impact and some influence on decisions that LEAs are making and on the actions that the field is taking.

02:39:51.513 --> 02:39:53.595
So I think it's important for us to

02:39:54.475 --> 02:40:08.249
look at when we start talking about the data, what is it we're asking the data system that informs the dashboard to do or to inform in the dashboard.

02:40:08.669 --> 02:40:11.532
It's really clear to me in reading the letters and in reading

02:40:12.762 --> 02:40:25.711
the articles that are being published about our dashboard and about our accountability system, there is still a great deal of variance in the continuum of expectations about what the dashboard is supposed to be doing.

02:40:26.131 --> 02:40:30.334
And this is one of those conversations about chronic absenteeism.

02:40:30.374 --> 02:40:34.918
There are people who think this is supposed to be part of an early warning system.

02:40:35.498 --> 02:40:44.784
You can't have an early warning system to define actions on absenteeism using data that's a lagging indicator.

02:40:44.844 --> 02:40:51.388
So those things don't mix, but it just sounds good to say we should have all of those elements included.

02:40:51.968 --> 02:41:02.135
But I think the other point that has to be looked at, as has been pointed out by the department staff, we have more granular information available

02:41:02.535 --> 02:41:15.130
to everyone, to all districts, to anybody in the public who wants to see it, that will give you the kind of actionable data that the dashboard is not intended to be used to do.

02:41:15.571 --> 02:41:18.915
So, I think it's important when we have this data conversation

02:41:19.355 --> 02:41:45.692
that we remain constant and vigilant in making sure the dashboard is used and the data that informs what's reported in the dashboard is used for very specific and articulated purposes that are different from the data reports that are available to schools to inform not only their LCAP, but to inform those decisions they need to make about this very important issue of absenteeism.

02:41:46.912 --> 02:41:57.375
Otherwise, anything that's reported on DataQuest, there's going to be some rationale for saying it needs to be added as part to define an indicator on the dashboard.

02:41:57.415 --> 02:42:04.276
And in the end, that will not be helpful and it will not create information that ultimately will be useful.

02:42:04.657 --> 02:42:07.117
So it's not that I believe we should, less is more.

02:42:07.137 --> 02:42:09.978
I just believe that whatever more we do,

02:42:10.758 --> 02:42:15.543
needs to improve what the dashboard is intended to do and not muddy the water.

02:42:15.963 --> 02:42:25.773
Because that's the reason why we're so confused and concerned about the development of the CCI because that's the conversation about data that we have never resolved.

02:42:29.893 --> 02:42:32.195
Okay, I think we're on to the next item.

02:42:32.235 --> 02:42:33.996
Great, we're on to attachment three.

02:42:34.437 --> 02:42:42.723
And I'm going to introduce this attachment and then Jenny Singh from our accountability unit will walk you through it.

02:42:43.183 --> 02:42:49.668
So this is, of course, the one-year graduation rate is specifically for our alternative schools.

02:42:49.928 --> 02:42:51.069
So keep that in mind.

02:42:52.270 --> 02:42:57.314
And maybe we need a name changer for it to say it's Alternative Schools Graduation Rate or something along those lines.

02:42:57.394 --> 02:42:59.656
But for now, we have one-year graduation rate.

02:43:00.196 --> 02:43:05.980
And you approved in May the use of the one-year graduation rate, of course, for our alternative schools.

02:43:06.020 --> 02:43:08.763
The Dashboard Alternative Schools Status is what we're calling them, DAS.

02:43:10.064 --> 02:43:12.866
in the methodology you also approved back in May.

02:43:13.927 --> 02:43:25.718
So, we're at a point now, this is the first that you will again have as action for cut scores, and in November we'll bring a series of cut scores to you, but this is the only cut score decision you're making.

02:43:26.518 --> 02:43:26.898
today.

02:43:28.039 --> 02:43:33.682
So we have the Alternative Schools Task Force which of course members have presented to you in the past.

02:43:34.162 --> 02:43:42.926
Roger Rice from Ventura County and we have representatives from Shasta as well as our colleague from the Gardner Center who's been

02:43:43.246 --> 02:43:44.767
been so gracious with this task force.

02:43:45.168 --> 02:43:49.951
They have recommended the status and change cut scores that you see today.

02:43:50.271 --> 02:43:58.077
We've also vetted this, of course, through our technical design group and we've shared this out at the practitioners advisory group as well as the LCFF stakeholder group.

02:43:58.818 --> 02:44:02.180
I did want to mention that there were a couple of letters that talked about the end size.

02:44:03.221 --> 02:44:11.068
And for those of you that may not have been at the main meeting, you can go to YouTube and you can look at the video and it starts at four hours and 17 minutes.

02:44:11.548 --> 02:44:15.291
And there was an exchange between member Burr and Mr. Sapp.

02:44:15.671 --> 02:44:24.459
And the question was about, you know, why this wasn't a part of the recommendation or could it be part of the recommendation to lower the end size for these schools to 15.

02:44:25.079 --> 02:44:30.864
And part of the concern that and Mr. Sapp can represent his opinion on his own, but what I took it as and what I

02:44:31.264 --> 02:44:54.606
Affirmed in that statement after we had the exchange was that we did not have a legal It was not They we didn't have a legal measure to allow us to reduce cut scores That was an action taken by the legislature that allowed for that smaller subgroup or smaller and size for specifically for our foster youth population and our Homeless, excuse me

02:44:56.587 --> 02:44:58.168
It's been a long morning already.

02:44:58.848 --> 02:44:59.209
It's only 1130.

02:45:01.070 --> 02:45:07.273
So that is the end size discussion and we thought that that was a very transparent way to have that.

02:45:07.473 --> 02:45:18.219
We neglected to follow up in a memo or in our board item in July as we said we would in mentioning why we did not bring it back to you because it was done in a public setting.

02:45:18.619 --> 02:45:24.163
So again, for those of you that ever want to watch this board and the interactions, we are on YouTube.

02:45:24.463 --> 02:45:25.424
This is being filmed.

02:45:25.484 --> 02:45:26.384
It's live streamed.

02:45:27.145 --> 02:45:28.426
And it had 500 views already.

02:45:28.486 --> 02:45:31.167
So maybe it'll grow to 1,000 by the end of today.

02:45:31.307 --> 02:45:41.054
But that is the end size piece that I just wanted to introduce before Jenny came up and talked through the technical details of this attachment.

02:45:49.540 --> 02:45:50.100
Good morning.

02:45:50.521 --> 02:45:51.701
Again, my name is Jenny Singh.

02:45:51.902 --> 02:45:55.384
I'm the Administrator and Accountability Office here in the department.

02:45:56.024 --> 02:46:01.508
Just wanted to again thank our Alternative Schools Task Force.

02:46:01.628 --> 02:46:08.733
They met several times, five full days, to actually go over the methodology and they provided us with

02:46:09.353 --> 02:46:19.517
some really good feedback, thoughtful feedback, and they really helped us increase our knowledge about the challenges that alternative schools face.

02:46:20.397 --> 02:46:27.200
So as they approved the methodology, we asked them to help us propose cut scores.

02:46:27.720 --> 02:46:36.667
And so you can see here on this table that for the status cut score, the very low, the graduation rate is 67% or less.

02:46:36.807 --> 02:46:42.172
That is consistent with non-alternative schools because that is set under ESSA.

02:46:42.632 --> 02:46:49.137
ESSA says that any school that has a graduation rate less than 67% must be identified for comprehensive support.

02:46:49.477 --> 02:46:53.701
So they kept that cut score where it was.

02:46:54.321 --> 02:47:01.225
You can see if you go to the other end, the very high, they've also changed that cut score for non-alternative schools.

02:47:01.265 --> 02:47:02.045
That cut score is 95%.

02:47:03.726 --> 02:47:06.807
But for DAS schools, they set that at 90%.

02:47:07.368 --> 02:47:09.309
90% is the statewide goal.

02:47:10.169 --> 02:47:20.194
And they thought that it was very appropriate to set the 90% at the very high, considering the distributions of their graduation rates that we currently have.

02:47:20.634 --> 02:47:23.936
And then there were some adjustments made to the low, medium, and high.

02:47:27.375 --> 02:47:35.079
So for the change cut scores, a little bit different again for our alternative schools versus our non-alternative schools.

02:47:36.079 --> 02:47:51.847
As Cindy alluded to in her comments, we have a lot of the alternative schools really serve small populations and that's the way they're designed so they can actually provide more direct services to students and more individualized services.

02:47:52.607 --> 02:47:59.611
So their end size for the graduation rate limits the number of schools that will actually get a performance level.

02:47:59.771 --> 02:48:07.996
And because the end sizes are so small, that does mean that there's going to be some, the changes are going to be greater from one year to the next.

02:48:08.016 --> 02:48:09.697
There's more flexibility in that data.

02:48:11.898 --> 02:48:15.019
So for the decline significantly, they set it at decline by more than 10%.

02:48:16.099 --> 02:48:18.099
For our non-alternative schools, that's 5%.

02:48:20.220 --> 02:48:24.701
And they did the same for increase significantly as well, so that it's equal.

02:48:25.061 --> 02:48:27.882
And then of course for declined, it's three to 10%.

02:48:29.162 --> 02:48:32.763
For maintained, it's increased or decreased by 3%.

02:48:32.803 --> 02:48:35.823
And then for increase, it's increased by 3% to less than 10%.

02:48:39.425 --> 02:48:50.545
So, it's slightly different than what we have for our traditional schools, but it does meet, it is based on the distributions that we have currently for our alternative schools.

02:48:52.543 --> 02:49:00.286
So we have been getting asked a lot of questions about, are these one-year grad rates going to be incorporated into the district data?

02:49:00.887 --> 02:49:12.912
There's been a lot of concern that because alternative schools did not have a dashboard for the 2017, and their data wasn't included at the LEA level, that that would never happen.

02:49:13.952 --> 02:49:22.596
And we've always been very consistent that as soon as we develop a dashboard for alternative schools, their data will be rolled up at the LEA level.

02:49:23.356 --> 02:49:35.001
So for the one-year grad rate, we're going to roll it up and we're going to take the data for all the traditional schools and we're going to take the data for our alternative schools.

02:49:35.021 --> 02:49:36.502
We're going to take the number of graduates.

02:49:37.942 --> 02:49:44.126
for the alternative schools and the number of graduates for the non-alternative schools, and we're gonna add them together.

02:49:44.306 --> 02:49:45.547
That's gonna give us our numerator.

02:49:46.907 --> 02:49:52.430
And then we're going to look at the number of students in the one-year grad rate at the alternative schools.

02:49:52.571 --> 02:49:57.774
So that includes all the students that meet the business rules, so the graduates and the non-graduates.

02:49:59.194 --> 02:50:03.417
We're gonna add them to the number of students in the four-year cohort.

02:50:04.097 --> 02:50:05.878
And of course, that will give us our denominator.

02:50:06.158 --> 02:50:09.700
We'll divide our numerator by our denominator to get a new rate for LEAs.

02:50:10.460 --> 02:50:15.483
As we've said in the past, we are going to be looking at enrollment data this coming year.

02:50:16.123 --> 02:50:23.667
There has been some suggestion that schools will start to transfer students to the alternative schools.

02:50:24.947 --> 02:50:32.011
And we said that we were going to go ahead and monitor the enrollment, especially after fall census day and especially towards the end of the year.

02:50:32.411 --> 02:50:41.096
So if we see a lot of transfers happening in the spring, then we will have to come back and bring a proposal to the board on how we want to address that issue.

02:50:41.396 --> 02:50:44.618
But we will be monitoring that and we want to make everyone aware of that.

02:50:46.175 --> 02:50:51.960
We are using the same five by five color table approved for our non-alternative schools.

02:50:53.040 --> 02:51:01.787
And you'll see in the next slide that table three shows the number of schools that would receive performance colors if you adopt the proposed cut scores.

02:51:02.688 --> 02:51:03.829
That's based on the class of 2016-17.

02:51:06.571 --> 02:51:13.119
So you can see here that we have 553 alternative schools that would receive a color.

02:51:14.340 --> 02:51:17.464
So we currently have, let me see.

02:51:20.941 --> 02:51:32.785
953 high schools, 953 alternative high schools but only about 58% of them are going to receive a color because only 58% have 30 or more students.

02:51:34.005 --> 02:51:36.826
From that you can see that a large percentage of them

02:51:37.926 --> 02:51:44.609
Almost 60% are going to be in the red performance level, so they will be identified for comprehensive support under ESSA.

02:51:45.669 --> 02:51:52.512
And then you can see that we of course have fewer schools that are at 80 that are green and blue.

02:51:52.972 --> 02:52:02.961
We do think that this will change over time as schools start reporting their data that in regards to the 12th grade students.

02:52:03.342 --> 02:52:10.909
So we are very hopeful that the number of schools that are red will go down and the number of schools that are green and blue will go up.

02:52:15.077 --> 02:52:26.661
So we are recommending that the State Board approve the proposed cut scores described in Tables 1 and 2 for the one-year graduation rate that we will apply to our alternative schools.

02:52:27.221 --> 02:52:30.902
And with that, I will be happy to answer any technical questions you may have.

02:52:30.922 --> 02:52:32.923
Okay, Board Member Ortiz-Lacon.

02:52:34.904 --> 02:52:35.244
Thank you.

02:52:35.264 --> 02:52:47.994
And I wasn't here in the May, during the May meeting, but if I'm reading this correctly, we would have 400 schools that would not be reported for accountability purposes because the end size is lower than 30, correct?

02:52:48.474 --> 02:52:51.376
Well, that's the number of schools that will not get a performance level.

02:52:51.496 --> 02:52:58.962
You may recall that we will report data on any school that has between 11 and 29 students.

02:52:59.302 --> 02:53:00.843
So data will be reported for them.

02:53:01.103 --> 02:53:02.064
They will not get a color.

02:53:02.384 --> 02:53:04.345
And it will be reported on the dashboard?

02:53:04.365 --> 02:53:04.965
The dashboard.

02:53:05.025 --> 02:53:05.745
OK, thank you.

02:53:07.126 --> 02:53:07.986
Any other questions?

02:53:09.407 --> 02:53:13.068
I'm wondering if we can change this to alternative schools.

02:53:13.288 --> 02:53:19.911
I mean, one year graduation rate, that may be a nice technical term, but I don't think it conveys to the public what's going on here.

02:53:20.691 --> 02:53:25.253
So can we call this the alternative schools graduation rate?

02:53:25.393 --> 02:53:26.855
We most certainly can.

02:53:27.355 --> 02:53:31.159
It's a technical term because people who are technical came up with it.

02:53:33.682 --> 02:53:35.764
So we are always happy to take recommendations.

02:53:35.985 --> 02:53:36.245
Yeah.

02:53:36.325 --> 02:53:40.109
I mean, I do a double take about these students going to graduate in one year.

02:53:40.129 --> 02:53:42.912
I mean, it's just it's counterintuitive.

02:53:43.032 --> 02:53:44.394
So board member Strauss.

02:53:45.093 --> 02:54:02.547
I just want to share, I was in San Diego County in May and North San Diego County meeting with 20 different school district leaders and they are very, very supportive of our alternative measures based on the challenges and the different type of education support students in these type of programs need.

02:54:02.927 --> 02:54:06.090
So just a positive support for us considering that.

02:54:06.150 --> 02:54:07.030
I just wanted to share that.

02:54:09.392 --> 02:54:10.013
Board Member Burr.

02:54:11.984 --> 02:54:16.088
So Jenny, can you go back to the table that shows the schools?

02:54:16.569 --> 02:54:18.391
And I just wanna make sure I understood you right.

02:54:18.431 --> 02:54:25.778
The idea is that for the dashboard, we will include these schools in whatever LEA they are part of.

02:54:26.238 --> 02:54:26.958
That is correct.

02:54:27.319 --> 02:54:33.522
So any school, all 953 DAS high schools, their data will roll up.

02:54:33.802 --> 02:54:41.245
Just because a school doesn't have enough students to get a color, that doesn't mean that we're not going to include their data at the district level.

02:54:41.626 --> 02:54:44.427
We will include all schools' data at the district level.

02:54:44.767 --> 02:54:56.080
And you'll be producing a five by five grid for the schools as well as the LEA so we can identify the schools just like you have them here for purposes of additional support?

02:54:56.580 --> 02:54:57.581
Yes, that is correct.

02:54:58.022 --> 02:54:58.362
Thank you.

02:55:00.304 --> 02:55:01.666
Board member Valdez.

02:55:02.930 --> 02:55:10.616
So this might not be within this indicator, but it also, I think, bleeds a little bit into chronic absenteeism.

02:55:11.236 --> 02:55:18.642
So for alternative schools, how they calculate attendance, which I know is, you know, we're talking about one year, but also this, it's just occurring to me now.

02:55:19.922 --> 02:55:34.245
The difference between hours that they need to be completers as opposed to positive attendance has caused some problems for districts where students are completing their hours, so they don't, the fifth day is mute because they've done the hours that they're required for the week.

02:55:34.685 --> 02:55:36.585
Is that something that's more legislative?

02:55:36.785 --> 02:55:41.966
Because it's still being reported on DataQuest in terms of chronic absenteeism.

02:55:41.986 --> 02:55:46.867
So for these alternative schools, they're still getting penalized, if you will, for that.

02:55:48.248 --> 02:55:50.110
You know, alternative schools are different.

02:55:50.170 --> 02:55:57.098
Many of them do report hours and there is a calculation that they need to do to convert that into days.

02:55:57.919 --> 02:56:02.244
So we do know that that has caused some problems for alternative schools.

02:56:02.624 --> 02:56:07.329
We also know that when students come to alternative schools, their attendance probably

02:56:07.930 --> 02:56:09.170
It's one of the reasons why they're there.

02:56:10.571 --> 02:56:21.974
So the attendance when they get there is many times is very poor and that's one of the things alternative schools work on is building up, making sure that those students understand attendance is really important.

02:56:22.994 --> 02:56:26.775
So yes, that does cause a little bit of a problem for alternative schools.

02:56:27.875 --> 02:56:33.497
Most of our alternative schools are high schools though and that information then will not be rolled up to the district level.

02:56:36.646 --> 02:56:41.433
But it's still reported in DataQuest and that's my concern.

02:56:41.453 --> 02:56:43.355
Yes, it is still reported in DataQuest.

02:56:43.415 --> 02:56:44.137
Okay, next item.

02:56:52.981 --> 02:57:00.388
Okay, now we're gonna move on to attachment four, incorporation of a five-year cohort graduation rate into the dashboard.

02:57:00.968 --> 02:57:08.215
So many of you know that ESSA does provide the option for states to include a five-year graduation rate into the accountability system.

02:57:09.556 --> 02:57:17.758
And this also states that if you do that, you need a long-term goal that is more rigorous than the four-year rate.

02:57:18.539 --> 02:57:19.699
This is nothing new.

02:57:20.179 --> 02:57:22.140
This was allowed under NCLB.

02:57:22.780 --> 02:57:28.561
And under NCLB, we actually did calculate a five and a six-year rate for AYP.

02:57:28.962 --> 02:57:33.603
So this is really, this is not new to the accountability system.

02:57:34.523 --> 02:57:42.030
So we did a thorough review of all 50 states and their approved plans.

02:57:42.290 --> 02:57:46.354
Actually, our student that we had, our intern student from Stanford did, of course.

02:57:46.474 --> 02:57:47.755
She did a wonderful job.

02:57:49.076 --> 02:57:55.482
And we found that many states created a combined four and five year graduation rate.

02:57:55.922 --> 02:57:59.225
And when they did the combination, it was either a simple or a weighted average.

02:58:00.186 --> 02:58:06.610
And it looked like they did not have to create a second more rigorous long-term goal.

02:58:07.251 --> 02:58:20.220
So we believe, based on the information that we've looked at, that a combined rate would allow us to take a five-year rate into account without creating separate long-term goals for a four- and five-year rate.

02:58:22.441 --> 02:58:34.231
So, one of the reasons we've been asked to look at a five-year rate is because it does incentivize non-alternative schools to keep their students enrolled for another year.

02:58:34.712 --> 02:58:41.657
Remember, our alternative schools have their own rate, so this would only apply to non-alternative schools.

02:58:42.678 --> 02:58:47.302
And so we do know that we have some students that take a little bit longer to graduate.

02:58:48.022 --> 02:58:53.867
Specifically, we have sometimes students with disabilities and English learners who may need extra time.

02:58:54.207 --> 02:59:02.573
So this is incentive for those traditional schools to keep their students at the school site instead of transferring them to an alternative school or an adult ed school.

02:59:03.454 --> 02:59:12.378
So we have developed some business rules on how to calculate this five-year rate so that it actually reflects increases in graduations.

02:59:12.738 --> 02:59:20.602
So we're gonna kind of hold everything, we're gonna hold everything the same for the four-year and the five-year.

02:59:20.622 --> 02:59:28.345
And one reason why we do this is because, as I said, many schools transfer their students to an adult ed program.

02:59:29.165 --> 02:59:32.007
So if you transfer students, your denominator goes down.

02:59:33.268 --> 02:59:36.091
If your denominator goes down, your graduation rate goes up.

02:59:37.172 --> 02:59:39.315
But you haven't actually graduated any more students.

02:59:39.936 --> 02:59:46.364
So we are developing a rate that would actually capture the increase in the number of students who are actually graduating in the fifth year.

02:59:48.382 --> 02:59:54.044
So we did explore multiple options for incorporating the five-year graduation rate into the dashboard.

02:59:54.084 --> 02:59:58.545
We detailed that in the August 2018 memo.

02:59:59.366 --> 03:00:06.508
And there were some options that we could implement in 2018, and there were other options we could not implement until 2019.

03:00:08.429 --> 03:00:17.212
And one of the reasons why, because people are really confused when we said we couldn't implement until 2019, they go, well, we've had four-year cohort rates for many, many years.

03:00:18.192 --> 03:00:18.853
That is true.

03:00:19.934 --> 03:00:28.801
Unfortunately, we did get some findings from a federal audit that actually required us to recalculate our graduation rates for the class of 2017.

03:00:29.382 --> 03:00:32.865
And we're going to apply those business rules to the class of 2018.

03:00:33.446 --> 03:00:36.909
And we put that information in a June memo.

03:00:37.509 --> 03:00:40.451
So we only went back to recalculate the class of 2017.

03:00:40.531 --> 03:00:44.714
We didn't go back to other graduating classes.

03:00:45.215 --> 03:00:50.659
So anything prior to the class of 2017 are based on the old business rules and are not comparable.

03:00:53.470 --> 03:01:04.414
So, option one, we could provide a performance level color for the four-year rate only, and then we would just provide the five-year graduation rate for informational purposes only.

03:01:05.535 --> 03:01:09.176
And of course, this certainly could be implemented for the 2018 dashboard.

03:01:10.056 --> 03:01:15.899
Option two would be to calculate a simple average that would combine the four and the five-year rate.

03:01:15.919 --> 03:01:21.441
And what a simple average means, it doesn't matter if you're a four-year graduate or a five-year graduate, you're gonna count the same.

03:01:22.601 --> 03:01:26.763
This requires two years of five-year graduation data.

03:01:27.803 --> 03:01:28.804
So we don't have that yet.

03:01:28.904 --> 03:01:30.024
We won't have that until 2019.

03:01:32.205 --> 03:01:33.706
So it cannot be implemented until 2019.

03:01:36.781 --> 03:01:40.966
Option three would be to calculate a weighted average for the four and five-year.

03:01:42.107 --> 03:01:50.997
And the states that are doing this, they traditionally give more weight to the four-year grad rate, to the four-year graduates, more weight to them than the five-year graduates.

03:01:51.517 --> 03:01:56.242
And of course, this of course requires two years of five-year data that we won't have until 2019.

03:01:58.544 --> 03:02:06.208
Option four would be to report the four and the five-year rates and assign a performance level to the higher of the two rates.

03:02:07.148 --> 03:02:20.675
And this is something that we can certainly do for 2018, but with this methodology, we would have to create a higher goal for the five-year graduation rate.

03:02:22.396 --> 03:02:23.216
Oops, wrong one.

03:02:25.111 --> 03:02:35.583
So, we are recommending that the board improve the inclusion of the five-year cohort rate into the 2018 dashboard for informational purposes only.

03:02:37.025 --> 03:02:43.653
Because there are really a lot of different policy implications for incorporating the five-year rate.

03:02:44.753 --> 03:02:58.201
We thought that we had some really in-depth discussion with our technical design group and our technical design group said there are many other options out there that we should probably explore and consider before finalizing how we want to proceed with this.

03:02:58.901 --> 03:03:08.887
So we would like to just display it this year and then have you direct us to further explore options for incorporating a five-year rate into the 2019 dashboard.

03:03:12.662 --> 03:03:15.368
And with that, I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.

03:03:18.160 --> 03:03:21.723
I just want to make sure I'm clear on what you're suggesting.

03:03:21.823 --> 03:03:25.786
First of all, thank you very much for all the work that's been done on this.

03:03:25.826 --> 03:03:33.112
And you're right, California has been exploring four-year and five-year graduation rate reporting for quite some time.

03:03:33.152 --> 03:03:33.952
So this is not new.

03:03:33.992 --> 03:03:38.776
And actually, this is an area that state has actually gotten quite good at.

03:03:38.816 --> 03:03:45.141
So I congratulate your department, not only for all the work, but for the level of expertise that's been developed on this.

03:03:45.641 --> 03:03:50.745
So I just want to make sure I understand what is being suggested by the department.

03:03:51.325 --> 03:04:04.734
The department wants us to implement one particular way of reporting the graduation data in the dashboard that would be reported this fall on the 2018 dashboard.

03:04:05.174 --> 03:04:15.301
And then maybe down the road, consider making a change that would switch from the four-year reporting to the five-year reporting at some year down the road.

03:04:15.821 --> 03:04:24.405
and that would have the net effect of changing what the dashboard data actually reports at the end for accountability purposes.

03:04:24.465 --> 03:04:25.125
Is that correct?

03:04:26.225 --> 03:04:26.726
Partially.

03:04:27.386 --> 03:04:34.609
It could be that the board decides that they don't want to combine the four and five year rates because of policy issues.

03:04:35.249 --> 03:04:38.533
and come up with a methodology that would display both.

03:04:38.973 --> 03:04:44.438
I mean, one of the options is to display the four and the five-year and assign the color to the highest.

03:04:44.458 --> 03:04:49.183
What I'm asking, your recommendation is not all those things you just said.

03:04:49.223 --> 03:04:53.187
Your recommendation is to implement a four-year report

03:04:53.667 --> 03:04:56.929
and then have the board consider down the road doing something else.

03:04:56.949 --> 03:04:57.489
Is that what I heard?

03:04:57.529 --> 03:04:57.970
That's correct.

03:04:58.210 --> 03:04:58.410
Okay.

03:04:58.430 --> 03:04:59.671
I just want to make sure.

03:04:59.991 --> 03:05:14.700
And the reason you're recommending that is because you believe some of the policy considerations about making the decision for doing the five-year reporting still needs to be worked out or still needs to be clarified.

03:05:15.202 --> 03:05:16.183
Yes, I believe that.

03:05:16.843 --> 03:05:20.345
I think that the board needs to have further discussion on some of the policy.

03:05:20.485 --> 03:05:25.048
And some of the specific clarification would be what the reporting could look like.

03:05:25.088 --> 03:05:43.200
So part of the reason why you're not ready to make the recommendation for the five year reporting is you'd actually what the bottom line is, you'd really like to have the chance to collect the data and to understand what the data says and what it will inform us of before we jump into doing the five year reporting.

03:05:43.320 --> 03:05:44.041
That is correct.

03:05:44.201 --> 03:05:47.384
I have this more.

03:05:47.484 --> 03:05:51.809
I'm not as sophisticated as some of you really smart Ph.D.s in your department.

03:05:52.129 --> 03:05:55.252
So I would just like somebody to say we ain't got the data.

03:05:55.553 --> 03:05:57.214
So we don't want you to adopt something.

03:05:57.275 --> 03:05:58.896
We don't know what it's going to say.

03:05:59.697 --> 03:06:00.518
I got the data.

03:06:00.538 --> 03:06:03.401
Vote member Ortiz-Lacon.

03:06:04.943 --> 03:06:05.303
Thank you.

03:06:05.423 --> 03:06:09.586
And I do agree that for now, we should probably just report it since you need two years of data.

03:06:10.106 --> 03:06:14.508
And it would be good to know how what each of these options means.

03:06:15.069 --> 03:06:23.313
When I look at calculate a simple average for four and five, I don't know that that adheres to ESSA because we're asking for the five year graduation rate.

03:06:23.333 --> 03:06:24.834
It has to be something more rigorous.

03:06:25.314 --> 03:06:28.336
So I don't know that a simple average is actually an option to consider.

03:06:28.916 --> 03:06:37.060
But also we know that the CCI is based on students that attain a four-year high school diploma in four years.

03:06:37.520 --> 03:06:44.243
So what would that mean when we're looking at the graduation rate, if we were to combine it, and then we're looking at the CCI.

03:06:44.563 --> 03:06:47.244
So just looking at how that impacts other indicators.

03:06:47.745 --> 03:06:48.065
Thank you.

03:06:48.465 --> 03:06:48.605
Okay.

03:06:54.912 --> 03:06:55.272
Go ahead.

03:06:55.793 --> 03:06:56.133
Thank you.

03:06:57.754 --> 03:06:58.014
Great.

03:06:58.475 --> 03:07:00.216
So I am here for the closer.

03:07:01.517 --> 03:07:02.978
And this is attachment five.

03:07:03.298 --> 03:07:06.881
And this is really it's been amazing work.

03:07:07.181 --> 03:07:11.924
And we will be talking a little bit about that actually a lot about the dashboard redesign in this attachment.

03:07:12.285 --> 03:07:19.510
But first I just wanted to give you sort of the lay of the land for the next couple of months for what districts and schools are experiencing.

03:07:19.990 --> 03:07:23.192
So the first is is that we have refreshed our

03:07:23.993 --> 03:07:41.706
Coordinator page for the dashboard and what that means is the individuals at this at the district level or the charter school Because of course there they are an LEA under our system now have access to input their local indicators So that information or that that access opened up in August.

03:07:41.726 --> 03:07:47.370
They needed to get their superintendent or their approval saying that they are the appropriate designee

03:07:48.670 --> 03:07:56.993
My colleague, Jeff Breshears, and his team have started a Tuesday at 2 webinar series for six weeks on the local indicators.

03:07:57.433 --> 03:08:12.217
They had almost 600 participants in their first webinar last week, and so they have been already hugely successful, and they're putting up a bar for us to reach when we start our webinar series on the state indicators in November.

03:08:12.697 --> 03:08:18.359
But prior to that, we are pleased to be collaborating with the California Collaboration on Educational Excellence.

03:08:18.459 --> 03:08:26.601
They have graciously agreed to spend some time in October to do a training or a module on our dashboard alternative school status.

03:08:26.621 --> 03:08:35.544
So we are excited to leverage their presence statewide to do that and get the word out about how DAS will now impact the dashboard.

03:08:36.164 --> 03:08:51.292
And then, just to close out, as we reach our holiday season, we reach really the fun time for data, when we will have gotten far enough that we can start sharing data with our LEAs during a private preview.

03:08:51.692 --> 03:08:55.174
Now, the beginning will be limited to those in which you've already taken action on.

03:08:55.554 --> 03:08:57.215
So, for example, suspension rate.

03:08:58.015 --> 03:09:06.317
Those that are pending action from you all in November, of course, are academic, is everything else, chronic absenteeism, college career indicators.

03:09:06.337 --> 03:09:14.139
So we will not be able to actually produce that until you take action, which means we're going to be hitting up against the Thanksgiving holiday yet again.

03:09:14.659 --> 03:09:22.861
But we'll be done well before Christmas with the public release and the identification of our districts that first week of December is our anticipated release date.

03:09:23.701 --> 03:09:28.942
So with that all in mind, I'm going to switch over to the dashboard redesign.

03:09:29.102 --> 03:09:38.565
And this has been something that we've been talking about really since we started sharing views of this dashboard almost 24 months ago.

03:09:39.005 --> 03:09:43.326
So this has really been an amazing process.

03:09:43.926 --> 03:09:49.748
I would say, when I look back at those old materials, because you've heard a lot of us looking back today, that Wayback Machine,

03:09:50.868 --> 03:09:56.852
I remember and I read that you all wanted this dashboard to be focused on parents.

03:09:57.192 --> 03:10:08.499
And when I think about what we produced, and we have a different frame of mind now looking back on 18 months worth of work, I think this first dashboard was a great tool for educators.

03:10:08.679 --> 03:10:11.281
And we have now moved into a great tool for parents.

03:10:11.321 --> 03:10:15.404
And I hope that you will put on a parent-friendly hat if you're not a parent and you

03:10:18.085 --> 03:10:23.309
you interact with parents like we all do, put on that parent-friendly hat as you look through the next couple of slides.

03:10:23.369 --> 03:10:25.651
Because I get technical myself.

03:10:25.671 --> 03:10:28.153
This is what I do, is data.

03:10:28.253 --> 03:10:35.999
And I had to even step back and say, oh, yeah, I guess that's not a good word to use to describe change.

03:10:36.339 --> 03:10:38.481
So that's how I'm going to lead.

03:10:38.721 --> 03:10:41.003
But this is a slide that we used.

03:10:41.383 --> 03:10:44.227
when we did stakeholder outreach between board meetings.

03:10:44.327 --> 03:10:50.636
So between July and today, we reached almost 1,000 individuals through our stakeholder outreach.

03:10:51.117 --> 03:10:57.166
We had a very broad group of individuals help us at a webinar.

03:10:57.566 --> 03:11:01.250
we had done actually a week's worth of stakeholder input.

03:11:01.371 --> 03:11:07.117
And over that week's worth, we were able to do iterations of the dashboard that you're going to finally see today.

03:11:07.277 --> 03:11:10.942
So these are the reasons why we're looking at enhancing the dashboard.

03:11:10.962 --> 03:11:17.189
And of course, this governor and the legislature approved a $300,000 allocation to do specifically that.

03:11:19.353 --> 03:11:26.677
So Collaborative Communications is the subcontractor of San Joaquin County Office of Education, who is, of course, our web developer and maintains our website.

03:11:27.578 --> 03:11:41.385
And so just to give you a flavor for who Collaborative Communications is, they've worked with the Council of Chief State School Officers, the Data Quality Campaign, Foundation for Education, Excellence in Education, Learning Heroes, National PTA.

03:11:41.745 --> 03:11:45.067
They've also worked with DC Public Schools and New York Public Schools.

03:11:48.666 --> 03:12:07.821
So when we talked to, or rather when Collaborative Communications came out and did a stakeholder input session, they had the work that they, the design that they had done, we shared with them all the feedback you had been giving us and others have been giving us over the last 18 months about what was working and what was opportunities for improvement.

03:12:07.921 --> 03:12:16.628
So as you had heard from, I think from Paul Richman and others from the CDE Foundation, they did a parent focus group and

03:12:17.589 --> 03:12:23.296
They came up with some of these broad statements, like student group breakdown, they like.

03:12:23.316 --> 03:12:24.337
They like the color ratings.

03:12:24.658 --> 03:12:26.740
They may have liked the pies, but they like the color ratings.

03:12:26.760 --> 03:12:33.007
So those are just a couple of things about what was working, and then opportunities for improvement were on the right.

03:12:33.848 --> 03:12:34.549
I have to say that

03:12:35.330 --> 03:12:42.651
When collaborative communications came on, the statement that we had shared was it was going to be very hard to move away from the pies.

03:12:43.092 --> 03:12:49.073
And after the first week of sun shining the new design, the pies were still a distraction.

03:12:49.213 --> 03:12:57.254
And so we took that to mean that there was a sign that we needed to move away from the pies and move into the land of gauges.

03:12:57.354 --> 03:13:00.015
So you're going to see that in just a minute.

03:13:00.715 --> 03:13:02.217
So this is a new friendly homepage.

03:13:03.017 --> 03:13:15.329
We're going to look for some pictures that are maybe a little more California specific, but you can already see at a glance the color and the impact that that makes.

03:13:16.390 --> 03:13:19.652
this site will be fully accessible.

03:13:19.772 --> 03:13:26.336
So we actually had to change the color from what the designer had suggested because it wasn't meeting color standards.

03:13:26.356 --> 03:13:34.542
So that's just an example of things that we adhere to and that San Joaquin County Office of Education implements on the back end.

03:13:35.342 --> 03:13:37.906
So this is the new landing page.

03:13:37.946 --> 03:13:44.836
And if you didn't get a chance to read one of the articles yesterday that talked about the new dashboard, it did quote Mia Sane.

03:13:44.876 --> 03:13:51.646
And this is what the designer shared with us, is there's a reduction in pages by 80% from the current dashboard to this dashboard.

03:13:52.166 --> 03:13:57.111
So if you think about the pages I'm going to show you in succession, this is one long scroll.

03:13:57.531 --> 03:14:03.077
But since we're on our mobile phones or we're on an app, we don't necessarily think of things in pages anymore.

03:14:03.197 --> 03:14:03.998
We like to scroll.

03:14:04.058 --> 03:14:05.739
So think about this as scrolling.

03:14:06.921 --> 03:14:11.405
So this is a made-up school.

03:14:11.825 --> 03:14:12.766
This is made-up data.

03:14:13.067 --> 03:14:14.148
I should say that from the get-go.

03:14:15.549 --> 03:14:25.280
And what you see at a glance from the first, before you start scrolling, is you see how they're doing on each of the indicators, including the local indicators.

03:14:25.761 --> 03:14:33.429
So we heard from the get-go, from that first session, it was really important to bring local indicators up aligned with the state indicators.

03:14:33.489 --> 03:14:34.971
They're on the same level.

03:14:35.291 --> 03:14:36.732
They're just as important.

03:14:37.473 --> 03:14:40.235
We may need to change things like adding the words priority one.

03:14:40.715 --> 03:14:41.336
What does that mean?

03:14:41.656 --> 03:14:48.962
So we had the opportunity to go over across the street to meet with our governor because he's very interested in this product.

03:14:49.502 --> 03:14:50.703
And that was one of the things he mentioned.

03:14:50.743 --> 03:14:52.064
What's priority one again?

03:14:52.084 --> 03:14:55.226
So it's nuanced for us because we're living it every day.

03:14:56.247 --> 03:14:57.628
But what does the public need to know?

03:14:57.708 --> 03:14:59.489
What do they need to know about priority one?

03:14:59.509 --> 03:15:02.051
They need to know, you know, it's about school facilities.

03:15:02.091 --> 03:15:06.554
It's about making sure we have teachers that are qualified to teach and those kinds of things.

03:15:06.614 --> 03:15:15.119
And so as you see these slides, there are things that I'll mention that we know we still need to improve the language to make it, again, accessible to all parents.

03:15:17.813 --> 03:15:20.175
So this is, again, same page, landing page.

03:15:20.315 --> 03:15:21.216
We've scrolled just a bit.

03:15:21.617 --> 03:15:24.740
We come up with this tile format that you saw previously.

03:15:24.880 --> 03:15:27.983
The tile format, just functionality-wise, is neat.

03:15:28.083 --> 03:15:30.966
It's because when you decrease it, they start to stack up.

03:15:31.046 --> 03:15:38.093
So if you're on a mobile device, of which many of our parents depend on to access things like the dashboard, you would see it really neatly stack up.

03:15:38.533 --> 03:15:41.836
So this is information that is currently included on the dashboard.

03:15:42.677 --> 03:15:50.325
At the summative level, we show the student groups included in LCFF, which, of course, are socially disadvantaged, English learners, and foster youth.

03:15:52.006 --> 03:15:54.048
We then are going to show you a backslide.

03:15:54.128 --> 03:15:58.452
So what we've been able to do is keep the user on the same page and simply turn over the card.

03:15:59.193 --> 03:16:00.194
So it's interactive.

03:16:00.414 --> 03:16:08.639
So what we had done before was, if you want to learn about what this means, you'd have to go to Glossary that took you to another page and got you really distracted.

03:16:09.019 --> 03:16:14.422
So the designer tried to use parent-friendly language.

03:16:15.482 --> 03:16:18.104
We know that we need to improve the word socioeconomic disadvantage still.

03:16:18.124 --> 03:16:19.845
We still haven't quite gotten it there yet.

03:16:20.545 --> 03:16:24.948
But really, it's a nice feature to keep somebody's interest on the page.

03:16:27.148 --> 03:16:29.448
We then go to the categories.

03:16:29.709 --> 03:16:33.569
So currently, it's done on a dashboard.

03:16:33.649 --> 03:16:34.770
It's done in a row format.

03:16:35.610 --> 03:16:43.651
To make this digestible, what the designer has suggested is to break it down between three categories, which is currently on the detailed report.

03:16:43.671 --> 03:16:45.812
So the first category is academic performance.

03:16:46.472 --> 03:16:51.693
And of course, that includes English language arts, mathematics, English learner progress, and college career.

03:16:52.273 --> 03:17:00.135
What you see for English Learner Progress is different than the others because we're showing you a sample of how we could envision the LPAC data being shown for fall.

03:17:00.255 --> 03:17:01.135
So I wanted to point that out.

03:17:01.175 --> 03:17:02.276
That's why it looks different.

03:17:03.356 --> 03:17:04.936
We need to start vetting this out.

03:17:04.976 --> 03:17:16.159
We have not been able to get out to stakeholders in the last week or so since we mocked this up, but this is an idea of how we would be able to display that data in lieu of having a color for this year.

03:17:18.072 --> 03:17:25.887
The academic engagement pieces that are built out would be chronic absenteeism Assuming that you approve the cut scores and in November and the graduation rate

03:17:26.960 --> 03:17:28.961
And then finally, conditions and climate.

03:17:29.142 --> 03:17:35.826
And we have, as you saw with the academic indicator, we have the three local indicators listed there as well.

03:17:36.086 --> 03:17:41.190
So they fit into the categories in which they're appropriate.

03:17:41.890 --> 03:17:49.796
So what I wanted to dig into was what is this card, baseball card for lack of a better word, what's involved in it?

03:17:50.496 --> 03:17:58.788
So what we've done is we've streamlined what you saw previously as a status and change report, as a detailed summary into this one card.

03:17:58.808 --> 03:18:01.853
So there's a lot of information here, a lot of rich information.

03:18:02.648 --> 03:18:10.476
And if you wanted to learn more about the indicator and what it meant, the first words about this indicator would be something that you would click on.

03:18:11.096 --> 03:18:13.899
Now, folks have told us, that's not intuitive, actually.

03:18:14.280 --> 03:18:16.662
I want to say, learn more, or something along those lines.

03:18:16.722 --> 03:18:26.452
So I do have a slide towards the end that shows some of the language choices that we have heard are still, people are stumbling on.

03:18:30.347 --> 03:18:36.849
So the other feature that we've heard a lot from the field on that we are going to be able to implement this year is being able to show a state summary.

03:18:37.429 --> 03:18:43.211
And what the designer has suggested is show the state summary for each indicator and for student groups.

03:18:43.572 --> 03:18:47.393
So you can see the toggle right now is between all students and state.

03:18:47.453 --> 03:18:48.693
And all students is highlighted.

03:18:49.173 --> 03:18:55.896
So you can toggle back to state to see how that school or district compares against all students in that district.

03:18:56.789 --> 03:19:08.112
For this district, they're in orange, which means, this is the clue, we're not using the word status, but that means that in this year, this past year, 78% graduated within four years.

03:19:08.812 --> 03:19:15.073
So we're talking about it being an active voice versus saying, this is status, because people just get, what does status mean?

03:19:15.153 --> 03:19:18.254
So just tell us what you wanna tell us in plain language.

03:19:18.794 --> 03:19:22.795
The other piece is telling us what, trying to tell the public,

03:19:23.855 --> 03:19:26.477
what this school or district did compared to last year.

03:19:26.617 --> 03:19:32.822
In other words, declined with an arrow has been something that people are seeming to embrace.

03:19:33.823 --> 03:19:37.887
Now the next baseball cards are things we've gotten quite a bit of feedback on.

03:19:39.028 --> 03:19:40.789
So I wanted to walk through that as well.

03:19:41.229 --> 03:19:44.212
So for this district, they have 13 student groups.

03:19:44.552 --> 03:19:49.836
So you see the 13 student groups spread out amongst the five different colors in the cards.

03:19:51.818 --> 03:20:05.686
What is interesting about this, and I believe this is based on real data, actually I was told it was, is that the overall performance level of this district is orange, but the majority of the student groups are either in yellow or green or blue.

03:20:06.286 --> 03:20:10.969
So it's really telling a story about the full breadth of student performance

03:20:11.909 --> 03:20:19.951
And how certain student groups can, depending on their end size or what have you, can actually drive the color.

03:20:19.991 --> 03:20:22.932
And sometimes it masks the other way.

03:20:23.032 --> 03:20:26.852
Maybe it'll be green, and you have the majority of student groups, and red or orange.

03:20:26.892 --> 03:20:29.533
So this is showing the full breadth of student performance.

03:20:29.993 --> 03:20:32.994
If I want to dig into the data, I'm going to click on View More Detail.

03:20:33.334 --> 03:20:35.114
And we're going to move to a new page.

03:20:35.354 --> 03:20:37.435
Now we're leaving page one, and we're moving to page two.

03:20:38.928 --> 03:20:48.453
So page two, and I'm switching to a different indicator, and this is because this is still a prototype, so only certain things have been updated with the new look and feel.

03:20:48.973 --> 03:20:52.795
So English language arts, what we see is all students overview.

03:20:53.095 --> 03:20:54.976
So for this district, they're yellow.

03:20:55.537 --> 03:21:00.899
What we need to make sure we do between our different cards, our tiles, is we use the same language.

03:21:00.939 --> 03:21:05.482
So we should use not only, this only includes change, we need to use status as well.

03:21:06.442 --> 03:21:10.864
It gives a brief description of what English Language Arts is, so it gives you a frame of reference.

03:21:11.784 --> 03:21:20.967
Moving down just a bit, this is a mock-up we've created because we haven't been able to change the prototype, but really just a list at a glance of where the student groups fall.

03:21:21.607 --> 03:21:28.770
So I can see, and again, this is for English Language Arts, that we have two student groups in the red, three in the orange.

03:21:28.810 --> 03:21:32.531
It lists the student groups by name, and then on through yellow and green.

03:21:33.251 --> 03:21:39.015
I can then dig into the data through these pockets, these tabs here at the top.

03:21:39.495 --> 03:21:43.338
Red groups, orange groups, yellow groups, green groups, blue groups.

03:21:43.538 --> 03:21:51.323
And we need to have another group that's no color or students who fall between the 11 and 29 marks.

03:21:51.363 --> 03:21:54.645
So they may not have a performance color, but we want to give their data out there.

03:21:54.665 --> 03:21:57.287
We want to make sure that those student groups show up somewhere.

03:21:57.447 --> 03:22:01.310
So we need to figure out, we need to land on something that makes sense.

03:22:01.350 --> 03:22:02.891
I still haven't gotten there yet myself.

03:22:04.572 --> 03:22:12.635
But as far as digging into the data, again, these cards probably need to, they will be updated to make sure that the language is consistent using status and change.

03:22:13.015 --> 03:22:16.937
But we've now introduced the number of students that are in each of these student populations.

03:22:17.277 --> 03:22:18.498
So for white students, it's 5,200.

03:22:18.698 --> 03:22:22.139
For students with disabilities, it's 25,000.

03:22:22.379 --> 03:22:26.421
So there's quite a bit of difference in those student groups.

03:22:26.441 --> 03:22:28.222
And so it tells you a lot of information.

03:22:29.002 --> 03:22:44.729
Still on that same page, you would get to additional information, some tables that we've created that show trends year over year, information about, for example, for academic, for Cal Alt results, and then for our English learner performance within the English learner student group.

03:22:46.747 --> 03:22:53.351
So just a flavor for word choices that we still have not arrived at decisions on.

03:22:53.711 --> 03:23:04.117
And I'd welcome if you have any additional ones that you've been following as well, because I know that some of you have been introduced to this redesigned dashboard over the last month.

03:23:04.577 --> 03:23:10.080
But options that we've heard from folks, and again, this has been a list we've been maintaining,

03:23:11.321 --> 03:23:16.384
is for parents, the distance from level three is still just a real stumbling block.

03:23:16.464 --> 03:23:17.545
It's not intuitive.

03:23:17.906 --> 03:23:23.089
So these are just, they're not exhaustive lists, but we put up three options.

03:23:23.430 --> 03:23:25.271
Distance from standard, distance from target.

03:23:25.651 --> 03:23:27.553
Let's keep with the same thing, distance from level three.

03:23:28.253 --> 03:23:32.416
The other is we heard that equity report, student group performance wasn't intuitive either.

03:23:33.371 --> 03:23:35.373
number of student groups in each performance level.

03:23:35.953 --> 03:23:37.655
How many student groups fall in each level?

03:23:38.075 --> 03:23:41.158
And then finally, just student group, that name.

03:23:41.758 --> 03:23:45.601
We had a parent session one evening, and somebody said, that sounds like they're in a club.

03:23:46.542 --> 03:23:47.203
What club are they in?

03:23:47.243 --> 03:23:49.224
I'm like, that's not what student group means.

03:23:49.745 --> 03:23:50.585
So that's

03:23:51.246 --> 03:23:51.686
That's real.

03:23:51.726 --> 03:23:58.172
That's a valid understanding of what the term student group means.

03:23:58.232 --> 03:24:07.119
And so while this is a much more friendlier version of the dashboard, we're still going to need to make some of these tweaks.

03:24:07.199 --> 03:24:18.748
And so I'm happy to answer questions, but we are really appreciative of your support and feedback and are very excited to be able to publicly release this come December.

03:24:20.598 --> 03:24:21.579
Okay, Board Member Strauss.

03:24:21.659 --> 03:24:31.327
So, first of all, Cindy, to you and your team, I mean, I've been in conversations probably every week with you and this has changed so many times to you and to Sarah and to the whole team that's been working on this.

03:24:32.308 --> 03:24:38.153
The field is saying it's much better, although there's still some areas, obviously, that you've highlighted that we need to tweak.

03:24:38.453 --> 03:24:43.778
So if you go back to that tile, I think it's improved with the equity report and

03:24:44.398 --> 03:24:58.664
how all the groups are doing, and the reason I say that is it tells you in a district, and I thought you illustrated this really carefully, like, this district has an orange rating, but they still have five groups that are doing well in green, but you got some red and oranges you gotta pay attention to and some yellows.

03:24:59.144 --> 03:25:02.585
So I actually like the fact that we're able to see where all the groups are.

03:25:02.645 --> 03:25:11.429
The only thing my recommendation would be is that, and I know it's about font and how much space there is, but it seems to make more sense to me, personally,

03:25:12.129 --> 03:25:16.572
is the number of student groups in each performance level.

03:25:16.612 --> 03:25:17.653
Like what does that mean?

03:25:17.733 --> 03:25:19.414
So it says student group performance.

03:25:19.474 --> 03:25:23.756
I think we just need a few more words there and I know there's some issue of space.

03:25:23.796 --> 03:25:25.958
So I just would say it's much better.

03:25:25.978 --> 03:25:32.362
I like equity report number of student groups and I like all the groups being, I think that's really reflective of the whole.

03:25:33.142 --> 03:25:39.386
how a whole school district is doing, but I would like to have a little more descriptor there.

03:25:39.406 --> 03:25:47.011
And my colleagues may have some other opinions, but just student per group performance by, I don't know.

03:25:47.411 --> 03:25:50.393
So your two choices, that to me just makes a little more sense.

03:25:50.433 --> 03:25:51.633
So just wanted to add that.

03:25:52.774 --> 03:25:53.955
Board member Ortiz-Lacon.

03:25:56.863 --> 03:25:59.984
So I know you've been waiting for this because you've had you said it was 3, 4, 0.

03:26:00.805 --> 03:26:02.566
This is actually you're getting to base.

03:26:02.706 --> 03:26:03.346
You are.

03:26:03.366 --> 03:26:03.906
Yeah.

03:26:04.307 --> 03:26:04.507
Yeah.

03:26:04.547 --> 03:26:05.827
There's some compliments on this.

03:26:06.067 --> 03:26:14.071
And I want to I want to say thank you for hearing my feedback when the equity report was not previously outlined.

03:26:14.551 --> 03:26:15.592
And so I like it.

03:26:15.612 --> 03:26:19.053
I do think it needs to be spelled out a little bit more.

03:26:19.193 --> 03:26:21.695
I understand the issue with real estate space here.

03:26:22.615 --> 03:26:24.557
maybe bolding equity report.

03:26:25.517 --> 03:26:36.965
It doesn't, the whole thing doesn't have to be bolded, but I would like to see bolding equity report for consistency with the other eye grabbing numbers like 78% graduating within four years that grabs my attention.

03:26:37.986 --> 03:26:43.070
And so we need to bold equity report so that it also calls my eye to that.

03:26:43.550 --> 03:26:45.571
But I think that this is nicely done.

03:26:45.812 --> 03:26:47.613
It's such a huge improvement.

03:26:47.693 --> 03:26:50.275
I know that the Spanish translation is also

03:26:51.117 --> 03:26:52.461
being translated properly.

03:26:52.481 --> 03:26:55.913
So kudos to you, the department, and everyone for working on this.

03:26:56.957 --> 03:26:57.237
Thank you.

03:26:57.297 --> 03:27:11.860
I should mention that San Joaquin County Office of Education also maintains the electronic IEP system for the state, which is SACE, and they have a group of Spanish translators who translate Spanish IEPs, and they have committed to using that same team for the dashboard.

03:27:11.900 --> 03:27:21.282
So folks that are familiar with, if they have students who are receiving an IEP, this will be a Spanish translation that is familiar to them.

03:27:22.603 --> 03:27:23.423
Board Member Holiday.

03:27:26.044 --> 03:27:31.667
I think it was a couple years ago I made a snarky comment in here about the state needing a graphic designer.

03:27:33.388 --> 03:27:35.809
And I think you've got one now.

03:27:35.929 --> 03:27:38.410
And this is so much better.

03:27:39.191 --> 03:27:40.191
I hated the pies too.

03:27:40.772 --> 03:27:43.213
And this is so much clearer, so much easier.

03:27:44.293 --> 03:27:49.116
I do agree with all the comments being made about word choice.

03:27:49.276 --> 03:27:59.060
And I'm impressed that you have, all of you that have been working on this, have the courage to actually make such a dramatic change in the look and the appearance of it.

03:27:59.080 --> 03:28:02.222
Because that's not an easily done thing, you know.

03:28:03.022 --> 03:28:05.503
But you did it and it's going to be great.

03:28:05.603 --> 03:28:08.445
It's going to be so much better for parents as well as educators.

03:28:10.163 --> 03:28:16.609
About the priority one, priority two, priority three, I don't really think you need to mention the words priority one or whatever.

03:28:16.629 --> 03:28:19.631
That doesn't mean anything to parents in particular.

03:28:20.172 --> 03:28:23.835
And then we see we've got priority one, two, and three, and then we could jump to six.

03:28:23.875 --> 03:28:24.956
Wait, where's four and five?

03:28:25.797 --> 03:28:28.959
And so I think that, so my recommendation would be getting rid of those.

03:28:29.039 --> 03:28:36.686
But I'm just, I'm so happy with the effort and the outcome that is going on here with the dashboard.

03:28:39.457 --> 03:28:42.399
Remember Valdez I'm very excited.

03:28:42.479 --> 03:29:02.713
I think you did a beautiful job though the work that's being done I think it's going to be well received as it has been already as you've rolled it out I just want to give kudos to that you were doing this in a phone format because that's going to be so important because most of our Parents don't have home computers anymore and the phone is their computer And so I think that was really really smart and I think that's going to be very well appreciated.

03:29:02.753 --> 03:29:07.777
So, thank you Remember son

03:29:08.359 --> 03:29:08.639
Thank you.

03:29:08.659 --> 03:29:10.740
So I wanted to add my kudos as well.

03:29:10.800 --> 03:29:18.945
It's a great way to end this presentation with all the poking we did to you today over this last four hours.

03:29:19.065 --> 03:29:21.087
So it really kudos to you.

03:29:21.207 --> 03:29:24.469
And this is I was also very, very excited to see this.

03:29:24.849 --> 03:29:31.393
It's a communication tool for the parents, but it's also a communication tool to our teachers, my governing board.

03:29:31.513 --> 03:29:35.215
It just makes the information so much more accessible to everyone.

03:29:35.636 --> 03:29:37.637
So, yeah, just wanted to add my kudos.

03:29:37.717 --> 03:29:37.937
Thanks.

03:29:40.148 --> 03:29:40.929
Board Member Rocker.

03:29:43.451 --> 03:29:46.034
Well, so I'll begin by saying yes, thank you.

03:29:46.174 --> 03:29:47.295
And I also want to thank you.

03:29:47.776 --> 03:29:59.208
Something else that folks don't know is the amount of time that you put in working with not only stakeholder groups, but with each of the individual board members to do the preview and to get their feedback and to make sure

03:29:59.668 --> 03:30:02.991
the work from stakeholders was strongly represented.

03:30:03.412 --> 03:30:05.774
And what we're seeing today is really important.

03:30:06.975 --> 03:30:13.081
I know that you're still working on the nuances of the language, the exposition that's going to be given.

03:30:13.141 --> 03:30:17.445
And that's something that you can continue working on even through the preview period.

03:30:17.485 --> 03:30:25.212
So, what's really important here is particularly on the definitions of what an English learner is and what a foster youth is.

03:30:25.692 --> 03:30:34.178
is that not only are we giving a consistent explanation, but that explanation is consistent with the intent of the indicator.

03:30:34.238 --> 03:30:42.524
So that we're not promising in the description of what the indicator says more than what the indicator actually is going to report.

03:30:43.124 --> 03:30:47.207
So, again, I'm happy to see the changes that were made.

03:30:48.648 --> 03:30:53.812
As to the criticism about the pie, I'm just going to quote our former president and say, well, who doesn't like pie?

03:30:54.272 --> 03:30:54.392
But...

03:30:55.493 --> 03:31:02.238
But that's okay because this does give a more visual and immediate way of seeing and understanding the comparison.

03:31:02.939 --> 03:31:09.503
I am really pleased and I agree with what board member Ortiz-Lincoln said concerning the equity report.

03:31:09.884 --> 03:31:19.911
It is really important that that also has a level of prominence that is retained as we make this transition from the previous reporting format to this one.

03:31:22.304 --> 03:31:23.746
Okay.

03:31:24.067 --> 03:31:24.768
Any other comments?

03:31:24.888 --> 03:31:25.128
No?

03:31:25.389 --> 03:31:26.531
Okay.

03:31:27.813 --> 03:31:28.434
Yes, I know.

03:31:28.454 --> 03:31:30.336
How do we want to handle lunch?

03:31:31.558 --> 03:31:32.800
Okay.

03:31:33.341 --> 03:31:35.725
So we'll move then to public comment on these items.

03:31:37.148 --> 03:31:39.350
Will the following people please line up?

03:31:39.530 --> 03:32:03.871
Doug McRae, Mary Perry, Martha Diaz, Jan Corner, Sergio Mendez, Danny Espinoza, Brian Rivas, Jessica Succo, Efren Marcado, Samantha Tran, Martha Alvarez, Anna, I think, Fontes, Andrea Ball, John Affeld.

03:32:07.300 --> 03:32:07.960
Good afternoon.

03:32:08.020 --> 03:32:13.021
I'm Doug McRae, a retired test publisher and required education measurement specialist.

03:32:13.061 --> 03:32:25.384
Given California's multiple measures status and change accountability system, we should have a fair amount of focus on the stability of the system over time, particularly the change part of the system.

03:32:26.184 --> 03:32:34.546
One policy principle that Ed Hartle drilled into everybody 15 to 20 years ago was, if you want to measure change, then don't change the measure.

03:32:35.558 --> 03:32:48.007
The mantra of continuous improvement applies nicely to curriculum instruction, but it flies in the face of this principle cited by Hartle for the assessment and the accountability portions.

03:32:48.987 --> 03:33:01.616
This conflict does not bode well for a smooth rollout of California's new status and change multiple measure system for the next few years until the change component settles down for many of the multiple measures involved.

03:33:02.177 --> 03:33:05.059
I say that despite the redesign, which I also think

03:33:05.879 --> 03:33:07.640
as you did, that it was very well done.

03:33:08.520 --> 03:33:08.860
Thank you.

03:33:13.041 --> 03:33:13.741
Good afternoon.

03:33:13.801 --> 03:33:17.202
Martha Zaragoza Diaz representing Californians Together.

03:33:17.902 --> 03:33:24.724
We support the inclusion of the state seal of biliteracy in the college and or career readiness indicator.

03:33:24.864 --> 03:33:34.287
However, we adamantly oppose the addition of math as a requirement to the prepared designation of the state seal for the following reasons.

03:33:34.867 --> 03:33:41.030
The state seal reflects the attainment of high levels of language and literacy in English and a second language.

03:33:41.630 --> 03:33:42.811
Mathematics doesn't.

03:33:43.371 --> 03:33:46.953
It is unrelated to the proficiency goals of the state seal.

03:33:47.773 --> 03:33:50.695
If the state board wishes to send the message to the field,

03:33:51.215 --> 03:34:10.510
that math and ELA scored at three or higher level is necessary for college and or career readiness, then make these indicators requirement for the CCI and allow LEAs to choose one other proposed measures for inclusion in the CCI.

03:34:10.931 --> 03:34:17.376
This would provide consistency across the board regarding the CCI with respect to math and ELA.

03:34:17.956 --> 03:34:30.707
We request that you not add or not support the addition of the math requirement to the state seal of biliteracy and include it as a standalone measure.

03:34:30.948 --> 03:34:31.188
Thank you.

03:34:35.523 --> 03:34:36.623
Hello, I'm Mary Perry.

03:34:36.683 --> 03:34:39.204
I'm representing the California State PTA.

03:34:40.085 --> 03:34:53.809
And one of the conversations earlier this morning talked about the purpose of the accountability system being to incentivize and bring focus to those things that you as a board and the state as a whole thinks are most important.

03:34:54.509 --> 03:34:59.211
The dashboard is for parents to be able to focus on those things.

03:34:59.771 --> 03:35:16.918
That's why we really encourage you to include that high school chronic absenteeism measure and also to flag for people the upcoming inclusion of the science assessments in the dashboard and do it now.

03:35:17.319 --> 03:35:22.741
We know implementation is an issue in the field and really hope that you take that into consideration.

03:35:27.659 --> 03:35:28.680
Hello, good afternoon.

03:35:28.860 --> 03:35:34.323
My name is Jan Correa, Chief Executive Officer of CABE, the California Association for Bilingual Education.

03:35:35.084 --> 03:35:46.932
As you know, CABE and our partners, Californians Together, have been key supporters of the state seal of biliteracy and have worked side by side for its implementation with the CDE under the leadership of Superintendent Torlakson.

03:35:47.993 --> 03:35:58.301
CABE supports the inclusion of the state syllabi literacy in the CCI as a standalone measure, and we strongly oppose the adding of the math requirement to the state syllabi literacy.

03:35:59.222 --> 03:36:10.151
The state syllabi literacy's intent, as per legislation, is to measure and award the attainment of academic, bilingual, and biliteracy skills, speaking, listening, reading, and writing in English and another language.

03:36:10.811 --> 03:36:17.837
The academic criteria that has been discussed and shared, as we've seen earlier today, is extremely rigorous.

03:36:18.998 --> 03:36:30.206
Research by Patrice Aganda and others have shown that biliteracy itself is a preferred skill across 10 sectors of our economy, and students who are biliterate are seen as successful in college and career readiness.

03:36:30.487 --> 03:36:30.787
Tom.

03:36:31.027 --> 03:36:38.053
While success in math achievement is a skill we strive to attain for all of our students, it is not an appropriate measure for determining biliteracy.

03:36:38.773 --> 03:36:50.247
Again, CABE supports the inclusion of the state seal of biliteracy in the CCI as a standalone measure and we request the State Board of Education not approve the inclusion of the math requirement to the state seal of biliteracy.

03:36:50.567 --> 03:36:51.148
Thanks very much.

03:36:54.721 --> 03:36:55.341
Good afternoon.

03:36:55.641 --> 03:36:58.022
My name is Sergio Mendoza, not Mendez.

03:36:58.082 --> 03:37:02.983
I wish I was related to him, and hopefully that doesn't start my time.

03:37:06.644 --> 03:37:11.665
I would like to get back in the circle, but we'll see what happens.

03:37:11.805 --> 03:37:12.185
I'm here.

03:37:12.725 --> 03:37:20.787
I'm the current secretary for CASQA, which is the California Association of Supervisors for Child Welfare and Attendance.

03:37:21.287 --> 03:37:23.911
So, I'm that person now.

03:37:23.931 --> 03:37:26.835
I also am part of the board for San Joaquin section.

03:37:26.875 --> 03:37:36.148
We have four sections in our state and we do provide a lot of professional development annually as well as during the year at each of our sections regarding

03:37:36.548 --> 03:37:45.658
attendance and SARB and I'm a practitioner of that process also and I'm in the option for the 31 days.

03:37:46.058 --> 03:37:52.425
I believe that the six-week period that we would have with students and individuals will give us enough time

03:37:53.345 --> 03:38:08.697
to implement some of the necessary steps to ensure that they graduate, ensure that we find out what they may need to be successful in school, or even recommend another location for school within our schools that we have presently.

03:38:09.578 --> 03:38:19.585
And again, with Ed Code 48-240-4824, it allows us to do that child welfare in attendance.

03:38:19.625 --> 03:38:20.486
So, thank you.

03:38:24.414 --> 03:38:26.738
Good afternoon, thank you for the opportunity to comment.

03:38:26.838 --> 03:38:29.943
Anna Fontes, great pronunciation with the Link Learning Alliance.

03:38:30.504 --> 03:38:37.675
Hundreds of schools are using evidence-based approaches such as Link Learning California Partnership Academies and other high quality

03:38:38.186 --> 03:38:43.790
college and career pathways to prepare their students to be successful in multiple paths beyond high school.

03:38:44.710 --> 03:39:00.741
We appreciate the board's commitment to remain on track with the inclusion of measures such as work-based learning, industry certificates, and urge the board to continue to seek the input across many stakeholders, including employers in the business community.

03:39:02.202 --> 03:39:07.126
We feel the current structure of the college and career indicator, college slash career indicator, excuse me,

03:39:09.247 --> 03:39:25.434
strongly favors students who thrive in traditional academic settings within K-12 and doesn't incentivize schools and districts to create programs that authentically align with the workforce as well as post-secondary needs.

03:39:25.954 --> 03:39:35.419
The unintended consequences referenced by members are already occurring and will continue to inequitably track students and perpetuate achievement and skills gaps.

03:39:36.459 --> 03:39:37.920
under this accountability framework.

03:39:38.280 --> 03:39:40.120
Thank you for your time and thank you for your efforts.

03:39:43.601 --> 03:39:44.082
Good afternoon.

03:39:44.142 --> 03:39:45.162
Michael Flores-Castaneda.

03:39:45.942 --> 03:39:48.963
Honored to be back here again this year representing the California Teachers Association.

03:39:49.943 --> 03:39:58.506
CTA supports the addition of the State Seal of Biliteracy, Golden State Seal, Merit Diploma, and the JROTC to the CCI indicator on the dashboard.

03:39:59.026 --> 03:40:00.246
We do have some concerns.

03:40:00.286 --> 03:40:05.448
I would ask the board to consider the unintended consequences, which Board Member Rucker and a couple others have addressed this morning.

03:40:06.029 --> 03:40:10.578
to the 2019 graduates who are on track to earn the state seal of biliteracy this year.

03:40:10.918 --> 03:40:15.688
And we would just ask the board to consider postponing the adding the math criteria this year.

03:40:15.768 --> 03:40:16.029
Thank you.

03:40:20.532 --> 03:40:23.895
Hi, Angela DeRamos, also representing California Teachers Association.

03:40:24.416 --> 03:40:35.746
And while we appreciate and like the streamlining of the student data on the new card system, sometimes the usability for different stakeholders, there's something to be lost.

03:40:35.866 --> 03:40:41.251
One significant piece that is lost is the equity report that shows the different groups on one page.

03:40:41.611 --> 03:40:45.394
When we're planning things like programs and LCAP and how we're going to

03:40:46.255 --> 03:40:50.021
address the achievement gaps between different groups.

03:40:50.442 --> 03:40:56.572
That piece of information is lost, so we encourage either putting it back or finding some other way to give that data.

03:40:56.872 --> 03:40:57.113
Thank you.

03:41:01.340 --> 03:41:04.805
Hello, Jessica Sacco, California Science Teachers Association.

03:41:05.386 --> 03:41:11.294
Two days and five years ago today, the State Board of Education voted to adopt the California Next Generation Science Standards.

03:41:11.774 --> 03:41:16.241
That action elicited applause and even a few whoops from those in the audience that day.

03:41:17.001 --> 03:41:31.073
Since then, the state board, the department, teachers, businesses, higher ed, nonprofits representing a huge range of perspectives have come together in one form or another in an effort to help realize a vision of a high quality science education for all kids K through 12.

03:41:32.054 --> 03:41:36.238
Standards implementation requires a systemic, multi-year, multi-faceted approach.

03:41:36.738 --> 03:41:42.644
That is why I'm here today to urge you to include a placeholder for science on the 2018 California School Dashboard.

03:41:43.304 --> 03:41:45.506
It is a critical piece of our education system.

03:41:45.927 --> 03:41:47.968
Simply put, the dashboard informs LCAPS.

03:41:48.389 --> 03:41:56.356
LCAPS should advance standards implementation, and the lack of science on the current dashboard is leading to a lack of investment in NGSS implementation.

03:41:56.776 --> 03:41:57.858
You've heard from PTA.

03:41:57.898 --> 03:41:59.059
You'll hear from others today.

03:41:59.520 --> 03:42:07.090
The field is ready for this information so that it's public and available for all in order to inform these multi-year plans to support NGSS.

03:42:07.410 --> 03:42:08.011
Thank you so much.

03:42:11.903 --> 03:42:24.052
Good afternoon, my name is Efren Mercado here on behalf of the California STEM Network, which is a statewide network as well as 13 regional networks who support science education, STEM education for kids across our state.

03:42:24.093 --> 03:42:26.955
We will echo the comments of Jessica Sacco from CSTA.

03:42:28.403 --> 03:42:32.605
The main priority for us for the CAS to be in the dashboard is knowing that the dashboard drives the LCAP.

03:42:32.705 --> 03:42:34.546
LCAP drives the investment.

03:42:34.606 --> 03:42:37.107
Investment has not happened in science across the states.

03:42:37.127 --> 03:42:38.188
We want to make sure it's in there.

03:42:38.728 --> 03:42:44.991
We all know that science education and STEM education is going to be key for our kids as they move forward into the future and as a key equity driver.

03:42:45.011 --> 03:42:48.393
So we wanted to advocate state board to include that placeholder in the dashboard.

03:42:48.593 --> 03:42:48.833
Thank you.

03:42:52.739 --> 03:42:54.660
Good afternoon, Samantha Tran with Children Now.

03:42:55.300 --> 03:43:00.443
I first wanted to start by thanking CDE and the State Board staff for all the work on the system to date.

03:43:00.483 --> 03:43:04.325
We know this is a big lift and there's been a lot of good effort on that front.

03:43:04.385 --> 03:43:08.467
In particular, I want to call out CDE staff on the website redesign work.

03:43:08.507 --> 03:43:10.668
It's been very collaborative and we've been appreciative of that.

03:43:11.348 --> 03:43:15.991
I'd like to echo the Science Teacher Association and California STEM Network

03:43:16.391 --> 03:43:22.295
comments about the dashboard and the inclusion of NGSS as a placeholder this year.

03:43:22.815 --> 03:43:36.004
In addition, the chronic absenteeism rate issue is something that we care deeply about and would encourage the board to include a color coding rating on the dashboard for state accountability purposes if we can't figure out the federal ones.

03:43:37.285 --> 03:43:49.333
We looked at some of this, the publicly available data, and found that for high schools, over a quarter of them, half the kids are exceeding the rate of chronic absenteeism.

03:43:49.793 --> 03:43:52.195
And so this is clearly a statewide issue.

03:43:52.275 --> 03:43:54.737
It's an important issue for locals to focus on.

03:43:54.757 --> 03:44:01.881
And in addition, we know that it's impactful for the children's outcomes and is actionable at the local level.

03:44:02.062 --> 03:44:02.562
Thank you very much.

03:44:07.731 --> 03:44:09.552
Daniel Espinoza from the Learning Policy Institute.

03:44:09.892 --> 03:44:14.154
I'd like to offer comments today on three indicators, the five-year grad rate, the CCI, and chronic absenteeism.

03:44:14.874 --> 03:44:25.259
We appreciate the progress towards including five-year graduation rates into the dashboard, and given current data limitations, we support the staff recommendation to report five-year graduation rates for information purposes only in the 2018 dashboard.

03:44:25.599 --> 03:44:32.703
However, we reiterate the importance of moving swiftly to include five-year graduation rates for accountability purposes in the 2019 dashboard, as 36 states have done.

03:44:33.483 --> 03:44:39.085
Additionally, LPI supports the inclusion of additional measures into the college slash career indicator in the fall 2018 dashboard.

03:44:39.526 --> 03:44:45.468
With respect to the state seal of biliteracy, research shows that biliteracy is a strong measure of both college and career readiness.

03:44:45.908 --> 03:44:51.330
We know, however, that other measures are prepared on the CCI has been commented today do not require a mathematics standard.

03:44:51.610 --> 03:45:00.534
We urge the board to consider a more consistent application of a mathematics standard across the CCI so as not to disproportionately impact a single racial, ethnic, or linguistic subgroup.

03:45:01.174 --> 03:45:09.139
Finally, of the 36 states in the District of Columbia using chronic absenteeism as an indicator under ESSA, 34 are using the indicator for all grades K-12.

03:45:09.579 --> 03:45:14.121
Only three states, including California, are limiting its use to specific grades.

03:45:14.642 --> 03:45:18.624
California should consider including these rates for all grades, not just K-8, in the state's dashboard.

03:45:18.844 --> 03:45:19.084
Thank you.

03:45:24.744 --> 03:45:28.826
President Kirst, I'm Brian Rivas speaking on behalf of the Education Trust West.

03:45:29.447 --> 03:45:33.169
First I want to say thank you for the work to improve the dashboard.

03:45:33.209 --> 03:45:36.531
We think it's greatly improved and like what we see.

03:45:37.811 --> 03:45:44.755
This morning I was concerned by the conversation around the CCI, the College and Career Indicator.

03:45:45.195 --> 03:45:48.437
Seems like some more work is needed.

03:45:49.338 --> 03:45:53.460
We think among all the indicators, CCI is the single most important.

03:45:54.120 --> 03:46:03.791
And it would seem that we need to be crystal clear on what it is, what we want it to tell us, and then we can turn to how we measure it.

03:46:03.891 --> 03:46:13.122
Seems like somehow, and I know they're building, they're doing a lot of work in building the new system, but it seemed like the staff jumped to how to measure before those first two points were addressed.

03:46:14.102 --> 03:46:24.688
On the narrow point about math and the state seal by literacy, we agree with our partners at Caltog and CABE that the state seal is rigorous in and of its own.

03:46:25.468 --> 03:46:31.051
And we think the dashboard would have a big hole if you leave chronic absence out for high schools.

03:46:38.238 --> 03:46:40.179
John Affeld from Public Advocates.

03:46:41.239 --> 03:46:47.902
Appreciate all the hard work that's been done and the conversation on the CCI in particular.

03:46:51.084 --> 03:47:05.770
Public Advocates in the Equity Coalition see this as a college and career indicator much in the way that board member Rucker and Ortiz-Lacon mentioned it and we expect that the

03:47:07.008 --> 03:47:13.879
indicators will prove worthy of both outcomes and not one or the other.

03:47:15.702 --> 03:47:21.905
In that regard, we are concerned with the inconsistency of the application of different indicators.

03:47:23.045 --> 03:47:30.650
AP alone, IB as a standalone, dual enrollment as a standalone can currently be done without a math component.

03:47:31.750 --> 03:47:35.232
And maybe we didn't realize that at the time, but that's a hole that needs to be addressed.

03:47:37.553 --> 03:47:48.856
And either you drop the math component from the state sealed by literacy or we have a nearly met math across the board, including for the Golden State Diploma.

03:47:49.056 --> 03:47:50.596
Tom.

03:47:50.816 --> 03:47:59.058
Also, we just saw data for the first time that 6.5% of Golden State Diploma holders don't reach the nearly met math level.

03:47:59.838 --> 03:48:03.559
So we think the overriding concern is one of consistency.

03:48:03.599 --> 03:48:03.819
Thank you.

03:48:07.438 --> 03:48:11.521
Good afternoon, Marta Alvarez on behalf of AXA, the Association of California School Administrators.

03:48:12.041 --> 03:48:16.664
First, I also echo that thanks to the CDE and state board staff on the improvements to the dashboard.

03:48:16.704 --> 03:48:25.069
We definitely are encouraged by the new display and think will be a great resource for parents to understand the progress and performance of students across the state in California.

03:48:25.769 --> 03:48:36.776
Second, we also provide our significant appreciation to CDE staff and state board staff for the memos, trying to provide information about the development of the future indicators and how they'll be incorporated into the dashboard.

03:48:37.296 --> 03:48:43.363
With that said, our members continue to be interested and supportive of the college and career indicator.

03:48:43.744 --> 03:48:46.988
They do see it as an and, not an or or choice for students.

03:48:47.548 --> 03:48:54.817
We are encouraged by the addition of new indicators to the CCI, as well as other indicators like the five-year graduation rate down the road.

03:48:55.878 --> 03:49:14.913
Despite of what the board action will be today on the new metrics that will be added, we do encourage you to think about the dashboard and the indicators in totality, not thinking them out in isolation or one by one, but coming back at some point in the near future and thinking how they all work together comprehensively, given that it is one single accountability system.

03:49:15.314 --> 03:49:15.614
Thank you.

03:49:19.326 --> 03:49:22.948
Good morning, Andrea Ball on behalf of the California School Boards Association.

03:49:23.168 --> 03:49:24.269
Three brief comments.

03:49:24.950 --> 03:49:31.634
First, we're very pleased and support the recommendation to add the additional measures to the college career indicator.

03:49:32.594 --> 03:49:35.776
We think this makes it a much richer and more robust indicator.

03:49:36.137 --> 03:49:45.563
We do share the concerns with CABE, Californians Together, and others about using math as part of the state seal of biliteracy and would urge you to not include that.

03:49:46.443 --> 03:49:51.725
Second, we really commend the department and you all for the improvements on the dashboard.

03:49:51.965 --> 03:50:04.068
As local governing members continue to improve their use and dialogue in using the dashboard, it's a really vital communication tool, and we think these improvements really are going in the right direction.

03:50:04.908 --> 03:50:14.273
We do echo and agree with the comments from the California Association of Science Teachers and Children to Get Children Now.

03:50:15.093 --> 03:50:18.174
We would like to see a placeholder for the California science test.

03:50:18.214 --> 03:50:27.619
I think this really does send, again, using the dashboard, it's an important communication tool, sending the message to the field that the science tests are coming and very important.

03:50:27.959 --> 03:50:28.239
Thank you.

03:50:37.146 --> 03:50:41.189
The board will get lunch and come back and reconvene at quarter of one.

03:50:41.209 --> 03:50:59.682
Okay, the board will reconvene and we're done with the public comment and the technical questions.

03:50:59.782 --> 03:51:02.084
So I'm going to turn to our liaisons.

03:51:03.182 --> 03:51:08.506
on the accountability area to make the next move, but we can have a comment.

03:51:08.546 --> 03:51:08.906
Go ahead.

03:51:09.346 --> 03:51:14.390
I'm sorry, just I know the liaisons need to help us work through this.

03:51:14.450 --> 03:51:15.631
I just want to make one quick comment.

03:51:16.991 --> 03:51:30.580
I do appreciate the great concern that I think all of us in the room have about the science NGSS standard rollout and progress being made there and the test scores.

03:51:30.600 --> 03:51:30.720
Cindy?

03:51:32.850 --> 03:51:34.812
I'm sorry.

03:51:37.355 --> 03:51:47.265
Do you have, remind me again, when is it possible for science test scores to be displayed on the dashboard?

03:51:47.665 --> 03:51:48.466
What's the prediction?

03:51:53.437 --> 03:51:54.579
I'm sorry.

03:51:55.060 --> 03:51:56.021
The earliest would be 2020.

03:51:56.101 --> 03:52:08.236
We could bring, you know, we can start, we've already been talking about this obviously to date and we were invited to talk to the science CISC.

03:52:08.877 --> 03:52:15.842
group about the challenges of leaving it as a coming soon because we don't know where it's going to be incorporated.

03:52:15.862 --> 03:52:21.767
Whether or not it's going to be incorporated into academic indicator or it's a standalone measure.

03:52:21.927 --> 03:52:26.770
So the hesitation on our part too is what we've seen with chronic absenteeism.

03:52:27.491 --> 03:52:32.775
We send you a link to the data and then it applies to things that it may not, you ultimately may decide it doesn't apply to.

03:52:32.975 --> 03:52:33.355
Understood.

03:52:33.796 --> 03:52:37.999
So there's lots of complications to it coming down the pipe that we have to talk about.

03:52:39.893 --> 03:52:45.916
And people have been using this word term placeholder, and I don't know what that would mean.

03:52:45.936 --> 03:52:55.302
I mean, we'd have one of those little gauges without an arrow in it, you know, or something like that, which I don't know would be very helpful to people.

03:52:55.602 --> 03:52:58.744
But I'm wondering whether or not it wouldn't be possible somewhere.

03:52:59.945 --> 03:53:16.148
on the dashboard to have a note to have and some bit of information that explains that the Because teachers educators parents even kids even have heard about the science, you know tests and scores and all that

03:53:16.688 --> 03:53:29.638
So having some sort of explanation somewhere on the dashboard that would give public recognition to the fact that the science test scores will be included on the dashboard, but it's not sure when or how or that sort of thing.

03:53:29.738 --> 03:53:30.759
That might be helpful.

03:53:32.120 --> 03:53:33.120
Let me follow up.

03:53:33.441 --> 03:53:39.105
So we've been doing a lot of talk about where we are in science and will be in November.

03:53:39.525 --> 03:53:44.949
having a comprehensive item for the board and our stakeholders on science.

03:53:45.309 --> 03:53:56.977
And on that, we want to review over the five years where we've been from the standards adoption, the framework writing, the materials recommendation will come to the board in November from IQC.

03:53:57.858 --> 03:53:59.679
Most of the materials that have been

03:54:00.780 --> 03:54:03.202
The submitted were recommended for approval, but not all.

03:54:03.663 --> 03:54:08.567
We also want to hear from the early implementers on what's been happening with the implementation of standards.

03:54:09.008 --> 03:54:16.094
We also want an update from ETS on our science assessment, where we are, what data they're telling us, what the reliability is.

03:54:16.514 --> 03:54:22.457
We hear a lot about that and we propose because we're going to do a whole comprehensive science discussion.

03:54:22.497 --> 03:54:32.523
Remember that the discussion of the dashboard placeholder be done at that time based on the fact that we'll see what the reliability is, what's happening with the pilot, what they can inform us.

03:54:32.603 --> 03:54:36.625
So just for the public and for all our stakeholders, we want a comprehensive.

03:54:37.025 --> 03:54:45.210
We've been already planning this item and we think that maybe all of that at the same time might be the best time to talk all about science.

03:54:46.169 --> 03:54:47.211
Board Member Williams.

03:54:50.376 --> 03:55:00.624
So I support member Holliday in his request as it's an alternative for consideration for us in November.

03:55:01.185 --> 03:55:15.636
An alternative to a gauge that doesn't have any data behind it could be a notation somewhere that explains about NGSS and when it's coming and that it will be on the dashboard and reported out publicly.

03:55:16.376 --> 03:55:18.718
I appreciate the fact that the board

03:55:19.779 --> 03:55:26.046
staff and leadership have decided to do a November session that is going to really focus on science.

03:55:26.267 --> 03:55:30.131
It's the first time we've had a major focus on NGSS in a long time.

03:55:30.832 --> 03:55:34.176
And I know that CDE staff has been working with

03:55:34.696 --> 03:55:45.362
Science Teachers Association and K-12 Alliance at WestEd and a lot of others to do professional learning workouts, rollouts, not workouts, rollouts.

03:55:45.923 --> 03:55:47.704
But I think it is true.

03:55:47.724 --> 03:55:58.931
I do believe that it has been the fact that it's not on the dashboard and that it's not, we haven't done a session focusing on NGSS at the state board.

03:55:59.891 --> 03:56:06.217
There's been a very weak signal, in my opinion, from the State Board about the importance of NGSS up until this point.

03:56:06.817 --> 03:56:07.758
Not intentional.

03:56:08.579 --> 03:56:11.161
We've had a lot on our plates and a lot of other stuff going on.

03:56:11.361 --> 03:56:12.322
Totally understand that.

03:56:12.542 --> 03:56:16.906
But this is, since the next test is supposed to be the first operational test.

03:56:17.666 --> 03:56:22.591
in the spring of 2019, it's really time that we go ahead and do this.

03:56:22.631 --> 03:56:26.895
So I appreciate the board leadership for making that a priority for November.

03:56:26.995 --> 03:56:35.663
And I think in the context of getting all of those updates, we can decide then what's the best way to send a signal on the dashboard about NGSS.

03:56:36.988 --> 03:56:42.270
Yeah, while we're on this, I'd like to request a report in November on the pilot test.

03:56:42.770 --> 03:56:52.635
Those of us that have been close, not now in November, those of us that have followed this, this is quite an innovative assessment.

03:56:53.595 --> 03:57:01.858
And I'm reluctant to move to some policy conclusions till I see what happened with this pilot test.

03:57:02.279 --> 03:57:04.840
It's very innovative, three-dimensional,

03:57:06.002 --> 03:57:14.888
And so you're making projections, but I'm not sure how you can do that solidly without knowing what the pilot test showed.

03:57:17.770 --> 03:57:22.114
All right, thank you.

03:57:22.154 --> 03:57:28.578
Carrick Ashley, just wanted to clarify, I'd be glad to do something in November, probably will not include actual student data.

03:57:29.139 --> 03:57:30.760
No, I want to know how it went.

03:57:31.721 --> 03:57:32.001
Correct.

03:57:32.602 --> 03:57:37.826
Is it, it could be the test could be delayed if it, you know, a lot of the items don't work.

03:57:38.867 --> 03:57:43.671
I mean, to me, this is a different test conceptually than anything we've dealt with.

03:57:43.731 --> 03:57:45.473
I'm not interested in student scores.

03:57:46.033 --> 03:57:50.997
I want to get what the projection is for getting this online.

03:57:51.117 --> 03:57:54.780
And I don't think we have the information now to give an answer to that.

03:57:55.141 --> 03:57:56.102
Thank you.

03:57:56.142 --> 03:58:00.065
By online, I mean, making a decision about how soon it's going to be phased in.

03:58:03.896 --> 03:58:04.036
Okay.

03:58:04.176 --> 03:58:08.038
So Cindy, I'm getting ready to make a motion.

03:58:08.539 --> 03:58:10.860
But I want to ask a question about the first item.

03:58:10.980 --> 03:58:16.323
So the recommendation is up on the screen for people who are needing their memory refreshed.

03:58:17.424 --> 03:58:24.168
There's some concern raised by both board members and also from our public commenters about the first item.

03:58:24.908 --> 03:58:48.855
And so I want to just ask a question about what the downside is or what would happen if we asked to delay that first inclusion of those indicators in the CCI and have you come back and do a little bit more conversation with us about, you know, the correlation between different indicators and why decisions were made and the consistency issue that was raised today.

03:58:49.455 --> 03:59:00.566
Because my concern is I don't want to delay it because I know a number of people really would like to see one or more of those items included in the CCI so it becomes more and more robust.

03:59:01.207 --> 03:59:06.772
But I also don't want to, you know, not be successful in a motion to include those.

03:59:06.793 --> 03:59:13.239
So I just want to know a little bit about what would happen if we asked to delay action on number one until November.

03:59:14.914 --> 03:59:36.277
So what we will be doing between now and November is using the class of 2018 data and running Our simulations against that to recommend cut scores if if the board You know is asking us by way of your question to create two different sets of cut scores that's of course a lot of additional work with again 70 million records and

03:59:36.697 --> 03:59:40.400
My suggestion would be maybe we do not include the information.

03:59:40.760 --> 03:59:42.721
We keep it to what you've already approved.

03:59:43.802 --> 03:59:49.466
Because in a lot of these groups, it's not large numbers of students.

03:59:49.506 --> 03:59:55.070
And perhaps there's students that are showing that they're prepared through another measure.

03:59:57.031 --> 04:00:02.213
I need to talk a little bit more with Jenny, but you saw it was on our workload for November.

04:00:02.233 --> 04:00:14.617
I do hesitate to have an option A and an option B ready, but I think the cut scores potentially could be considered valid and reliable, the recommendation, if you decided to, at the last minute, put them back in.

04:00:15.617 --> 04:00:28.989
But if you delay it altogether and don't move on this come November, the major category that students will demonstrate preparedness is by the Smarter Balanced assessment because that's what we see in the current data set.

04:00:29.449 --> 04:00:38.157
So it is truly going to be the test driving this measure as well as our new academic measure for grade 11, which is Smarter Balanced.

04:00:38.197 --> 04:00:41.880
So just want to make sure that that's shared.

04:00:43.181 --> 04:00:44.522
I'm prepared to make a motion.

04:00:45.502 --> 04:00:55.628
So, I'm going to recommend we approve the CD recommendation with the modification of the inclusion of the sealed biliteracy removing the math requirement.

04:00:56.409 --> 04:01:00.151
So, everything that you've recommended with the modification on that number one.

04:01:00.531 --> 04:01:00.831
Second.

04:01:03.053 --> 04:01:03.293
Okay.

04:01:03.413 --> 04:01:04.614
Any further board discussion?

04:01:09.285 --> 04:01:15.410
I am concerned about the ROTC language that appears right here instead of JROTC.

04:01:15.610 --> 04:01:22.035
I mean, if this is a on-the-record motion, don't we have to be precise about the terminology here for this one?

04:01:22.635 --> 04:01:23.856
What would you like to change to?

04:01:24.198 --> 04:01:28.141
Well, honestly, I don't know what the course code language is.

04:01:28.161 --> 04:01:30.703
The course code language is Leadership Military Science.

04:01:30.723 --> 04:01:41.572
So if we eliminated the words Reserve Officer Training Corps, ROTC, it would more accurately reflect the full breadth of programs that students are in that course for.

04:01:41.652 --> 04:01:43.333
So I'd accept that as an edit.

04:01:44.674 --> 04:01:45.755
I accept as a second.

04:01:46.823 --> 04:01:54.485
So this is leaving aside all the issues about college and career and the consistency.

04:01:54.965 --> 04:02:03.588
So we would be approving the, under this motion, the Golden State as proposed?

04:02:04.148 --> 04:02:04.388
Yes.

04:02:04.868 --> 04:02:10.590
And we would not be worried about the consistencies among the measures if this is approved?

04:02:11.408 --> 04:02:22.215
Well, I mean, I think a follow-up would be, I would request that the staff do continued study and bring back to CPAG and our advisory groups the issue of consistency and follow-up.

04:02:22.575 --> 04:02:36.123
But it allows us, if this passes, to get some other indicators than what we currently have in with the understanding that we have the benefit of revisiting it next year and looking at the issues of consistency.

04:02:37.981 --> 04:02:43.805
I could support it with the exception of taking the Golden State Seal merit diploma.

04:02:46.927 --> 04:02:49.689
Yeah, I think we need to look at that particular measure.

04:02:52.253 --> 04:02:54.635
All right, well, so I'll modify it.

04:02:54.855 --> 04:03:01.001
So we've got number one, the inclusion of SEAL biliteracy with the removal of math.

04:03:02.002 --> 04:03:11.810
Remove the Golden State SEAL diploma completely and modify the language for the leadership military science and approve the rest.

04:03:13.772 --> 04:03:15.033
Do you accept those edits?

04:03:16.437 --> 04:03:20.461
Reluctantly, so I will second the amended.

04:03:20.481 --> 04:03:32.655
I just ask that the department again come back and talk about the interactions between the inclusion of certain indicators and how they're using it because

04:03:33.075 --> 04:03:41.199
Well, I'll just say what I'm concerned about, about taking out the Golden State seal is that all of this, they ran through all of our advisory committees.

04:03:41.259 --> 04:03:44.521
They ran through TDG, which is what we really rely on.

04:03:44.561 --> 04:03:49.804
We rely on those technical folks to say, yes, this meets our criteria or it doesn't.

04:03:50.464 --> 04:03:53.706
And we're overriding TDG by doing that.

04:03:53.726 --> 04:03:56.448
And that's what makes me very concerned.

04:03:57.528 --> 04:03:58.989
Board member Rucker.

04:04:01.149 --> 04:04:07.352
I'm not concerned about overriding the recommendation of the TDG because it is only a recommendation.

04:04:07.872 --> 04:04:22.959
I'm concerned that the internal consistency of all of these elements needs to be considered, needs to be clear, and it needs to have a common consensus among all of us about what that consistency should look like.

04:04:23.479 --> 04:04:27.040
We're not ready to do that with all of these elements.

04:04:27.080 --> 04:04:30.801
So it is important to remove or at least edit some of these.

04:04:31.421 --> 04:04:45.845
But also, if this motion is being contemplated, knowing we can go down the road and change it, I'm not comfortable with just voting the motion so that we can move forward knowing it's, you know, a year from now, we'll change our minds and do something else different.

04:04:46.165 --> 04:04:49.006
We also need to tell the field that this is the direction

04:04:49.486 --> 04:04:55.408
the development of these elements is taking, we're not going to step back and say, oh, I want to change this again.

04:04:55.929 --> 04:05:03.732
So if we're doing this motion so we can move forward, knowing that we're going to ask the staff to go and do some data runs because we may want to reconsider it.

04:05:04.032 --> 04:05:06.493
The motion's not of much value today anyway.

04:05:08.841 --> 04:05:17.308
I'm also concerned about this college and career issue and interested in pursuing discussion of post-secondary education.

04:05:17.988 --> 04:05:19.970
I think college is vague to people.

04:05:20.470 --> 04:05:24.093
Typically, in a lot of circles, it implies four-year colleges.

04:05:25.214 --> 04:05:31.479
So, we've, you know, this flash career, it's dodging the issue.

04:05:32.320 --> 04:05:32.520
So,

04:05:34.815 --> 04:05:36.937
I think there's some fundamental problems here.

04:05:36.977 --> 04:05:41.442
I'm still uneasy about as board member Rucker is about the whole enterprise.

04:05:42.423 --> 04:05:50.292
Not that I don't support it, but that we have everything thought through here and we're adding measures here and there without the...

04:05:53.064 --> 04:05:56.247
I'm conflicted because I want to support the Golden State.

04:05:56.688 --> 04:06:03.355
I mean, I want to say seal of biliteracy and have some other indicators in the CCI.

04:06:03.415 --> 04:06:07.199
But at the same time, I think we have some fundamental issues we haven't resolved yet.

04:06:07.219 --> 04:06:12.766
Board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

04:06:14.814 --> 04:06:26.951
I honestly don't know what our options are because if we just keep it, if we say we're going to delay this and keep the CCI as currently, as we currently have it, there is still inconsistency across the criteria for that.

04:06:27.051 --> 04:06:30.335
So we are still leaving something that is inconsistent.

04:06:31.937 --> 04:06:39.008
And then we miss opportunity of adding these two elements to the indicator for the December release.

04:06:39.528 --> 04:06:46.959
Now, the bigger picture, I think we've had so much coming at us, but there has been a lot of letters, a lot of groups that have pointed out

04:06:48.081 --> 04:06:50.163
the issues with this indicator.

04:06:51.224 --> 04:06:57.010
Maybe we're the ones that are kind of late to the party of having that sense of, oh my, what are we building here?

04:06:57.370 --> 04:07:03.936
But there's been a lot of different folks, scholars, researchers that have pointed at this and have said

04:07:04.677 --> 04:07:05.638
What are you building?

04:07:05.738 --> 04:07:10.340
Because what we initially heard presentations was around college and career.

04:07:10.661 --> 04:07:16.824
And then it started drifting into something else to the point where now we really are saying, well, it could be either or.

04:07:16.884 --> 04:07:18.025
It's non-bindery.

04:07:18.085 --> 04:07:20.166
You make it what you want.

04:07:20.246 --> 04:07:23.148
And that's not OK for us to tell the field

04:07:23.948 --> 04:07:28.612
Just make, you know, define it as you may, because we're the ones setting the policy here.

04:07:29.113 --> 04:07:35.058
But I don't know what other alternatives we have, because we would have to essentially say, let's shut this down and start all over.

04:07:36.220 --> 04:07:41.905
And I think we're too far down the road, although we do have a system of continuous improvement.

04:07:42.665 --> 04:07:54.034
I don't know that continuous improvement means that we completely go back and say the last two years has not been a good use of anyone's time and we have something that is not a viable or reliable indicator.

04:08:01.707 --> 04:08:10.378
Just, I appreciate the rich discussion this morning and it's, I also am very supportive of the proposed motion as amended.

04:08:10.398 --> 04:08:16.165
I think that we do need to go beyond standardized test scores in our accountability system.

04:08:16.205 --> 04:08:17.627
We have to look at multiple measures.

04:08:18.187 --> 04:08:22.894
And I think there's a research foundation that's very strong for including the state seal of biliteracy.

04:08:23.434 --> 04:08:28.561
I also want to avoid the perception that we're adding other levels.

04:08:28.641 --> 04:08:34.129
And I know that by including math, it doesn't prohibit a student from earning the state seal.

04:08:34.249 --> 04:08:35.511
This is just for accountability.

04:08:36.051 --> 04:08:47.823
But if there's even a perception or a signal out in the field or in the public that we are singling out one particular measure unfairly or inconsistently, then that's a problem.

04:08:47.863 --> 04:08:56.211
So I think that your revised motion addresses that and I think allows us to have another measure.

04:08:56.311 --> 04:08:59.214
So I would, I'm very supportive of the motion.

04:08:59.254 --> 04:09:00.255
I don't want to delay

04:09:01.275 --> 04:09:16.226
adding other measures because I think we have to demonstrate how well we are preparing our students for life beyond high school graduation and we need multiple measures to be able to tell that story.

04:09:16.246 --> 04:09:19.208
Board Member Valdez.

04:09:21.701 --> 04:09:37.431
So I can support the motion as it was made, but I also think fundamentally and what President Kurtz talked about, I think the elephant in the room is that out in the field, we're saying we are preparing students to have options, to have a college and career choice.

04:09:37.511 --> 04:09:38.411
That's their option.

04:09:38.451 --> 04:09:45.516
It's not an or, and the or for me relays more tracking and this is the pathway you're going and you're stuck on that pathway.

04:09:46.116 --> 04:09:54.041
that the conversation I think still needs to happen about post-secondary or whatever we're going to call it within all of this but for now I think we need to move forward.

04:09:58.058 --> 04:10:15.870
I think the other problem the motion doesn't address is what came up during the conversation today that somehow the name of the indicator or the meaning of the indicator itself seems to change between one level or the other.

04:10:16.570 --> 04:10:21.572
If we're talking about the approaching preparedness, it's college and career.

04:10:22.032 --> 04:10:25.674
If we're talking about prepared, it's college or career.

04:10:25.694 --> 04:10:29.895
And then if we go to the next one, well prepared, it's college and career.

04:10:30.175 --> 04:10:34.077
That's not what I voted for when we actually implemented this indicator.

04:10:34.497 --> 04:10:37.098
So now we're going to add indicators

04:10:37.598 --> 04:10:45.885
and add criteria for those indicators in two of these levels today, and we're still not clear on what it means.

04:10:46.366 --> 04:10:58.756
So if we're going to add this data, that's nice because adding the, what I'm hearing is I want to move forward on the motion because we really want to send a message to the field that these elements are important.

04:10:59.216 --> 04:11:00.857
Well, we need to send a message to the field.

04:11:00.897 --> 04:11:09.442
These elements are important and here's how you're supposed to apply them in the decisions you make and creating access for students and giving students advice.

04:11:09.502 --> 04:11:10.942
And we're not doing that.

04:11:11.003 --> 04:11:13.564
We're not adding any clarity with that.

04:11:13.604 --> 04:11:24.550
So I'm actually not ready to support this motion because there were more questions actually put on the table in today's conversation that this motion does not resolve.

04:11:26.400 --> 04:11:38.884
If we could divide the motion, I know you attempted to amend it, but if we could divide the motion and make an affirmative statement on what will be added and what won't be added, that's one thing.

04:11:39.264 --> 04:11:50.367
But if we're going forward to saying that this motion further defines how this is going to operate, which is what was implied in the conversation, that's something else and I'm concerned about that.

04:11:51.408 --> 04:11:54.809
Okay, go back over what the motion, I think we're ready now.

04:11:57.436 --> 04:12:01.518
After you accepted the friendly amendments, where are we?

04:12:02.058 --> 04:12:02.458
What?

04:12:03.499 --> 04:12:11.282
Council will attempt to restate the motion subject to the two amendments that were made, accepted and seconded, as I understand it.

04:12:11.302 --> 04:12:15.724
This applies only to the first part of the CD recommendation, so the

04:12:16.484 --> 04:12:21.686
The motion to approve the city recommendation as to parts 2, 3, and 4 remains unchanged.

04:12:22.306 --> 04:12:31.229
So I'm going to repeat back and please confirm that we all have the same understanding of the modified motion is to approve the inclusion of the state seal of biliteracy.

04:12:32.349 --> 04:12:39.351
and leadership slash military science as additional measures in the college career indicator.

04:12:39.791 --> 04:12:46.854
So striking Golden State SEAL merit diploma and striking the colon reserve officer training courts.

04:12:47.774 --> 04:12:50.615
And removing the math requirement from the SEAL.

04:12:50.695 --> 04:13:00.918
And then also for the SEAL biliteracy striking the inclusion of the additional math level to approaching prepared or nearly met.

04:13:02.708 --> 04:13:02.848
Okay.

04:13:02.888 --> 04:13:03.949
We're straight on the motion.

04:13:04.109 --> 04:13:04.489
Okay.

04:13:05.189 --> 04:13:06.230
Clerk will call the roll.

04:13:06.950 --> 04:13:07.371
Unchanged.

04:13:08.892 --> 04:13:09.172
Okay.

04:13:10.533 --> 04:13:12.133
So, Bruce Holliday.

04:13:12.974 --> 04:13:13.214
Yes.

04:13:14.855 --> 04:13:15.776
Emma Cardenas.

04:13:16.576 --> 04:13:16.816
Yes.

04:13:18.137 --> 04:13:18.957
Vicki Sandoval.

04:13:19.117 --> 04:13:19.238
Yes.

04:13:19.918 --> 04:13:20.618
Trish Williams.

04:13:20.798 --> 04:13:20.919
Yes.

04:13:21.739 --> 04:13:22.299
Ting Sung.

04:13:24.260 --> 04:13:24.621
Yes.

04:13:25.021 --> 04:13:29.644
But can we please bring back the discussion about the infrastructure?

04:13:29.664 --> 04:13:31.305
Okay.

04:13:31.585 --> 04:13:32.005
Mike Kearse.

04:13:32.481 --> 04:13:33.702
I'm in the same yes spot.

04:13:35.163 --> 04:13:35.884
Eileen Strauss.

04:13:36.764 --> 04:13:37.185
Sue Burr.

04:13:38.286 --> 04:13:39.507
Feliz Ortiz-Lucon.

04:13:42.029 --> 04:13:42.789
Karen Valdez.

04:13:43.570 --> 04:13:44.290
Patricia Rucker.

04:13:47.453 --> 04:13:48.574
Okay, it's unanimous.

04:13:49.274 --> 04:13:49.595
Thank you.

04:13:49.675 --> 04:13:50.916
All right, thank you.

04:13:51.556 --> 04:13:55.279
All right, now we're ready to move on to item two.

04:13:58.582 --> 04:14:00.643
So we made it to the second item.

04:14:04.496 --> 04:14:06.938
But the first one had about six elements in it.

04:14:06.978 --> 04:14:15.483
So, I mean, it's not... So, Carrick Ashley, Deputy Superintendent, Performance Planning and Technology Branch.

04:14:16.564 --> 04:14:22.448
So, we did not have a system of support item for you back in July.

04:14:23.569 --> 04:14:30.434
As you may remember, our Director of the Improvement Accountability Division, Melanie Sheppy Green,

04:14:31.647 --> 04:14:32.727
went on maternity leave.

04:14:33.888 --> 04:14:37.628
She hopefully will return in time for a November item.

04:14:38.808 --> 04:14:42.309
So we are presenting an item on the system of support.

04:14:42.609 --> 04:14:48.690
It's a joint item between CDE and Westat and CCEE.

04:14:49.110 --> 04:14:58.292
Normally we would have county offices as part of this presentation of system support because they're a major part of this team, but we do have current RFPs out there

04:14:58.972 --> 04:15:02.013
that relate to county offices and this specific item.

04:15:02.313 --> 04:15:07.856
So we wanted to make sure that there was no conflict of having one of them present.

04:15:08.496 --> 04:15:18.980
So as you may remember, Melanie Sheppey-Green always liked to start her presentations with pictures of photos of students to kind of ground us and remind us of why we're doing this.

04:15:19.460 --> 04:15:23.262
So in her honor, we are going to start this presentation.

04:15:24.122 --> 04:15:28.726
with a future student in California.

04:15:30.047 --> 04:15:35.651
This is Joshua Christopher Green, who was born on July 1.

04:15:37.092 --> 04:15:46.300
As you can see, he's got his little onesie on here that says, my green boy is blue, with a nice little pie here.

04:15:46.320 --> 04:15:46.360
So.

04:15:47.100 --> 04:15:47.220
So.

04:15:53.065 --> 04:15:55.306
So that was my wife's doing, by the way.

04:15:56.607 --> 04:16:05.753
So by December, of course, we will release the new dashboard, and we will have outgrown the pies.

04:16:06.294 --> 04:16:08.955
And as you'll see from the picture, by December, so will he.

04:16:13.338 --> 04:16:20.721
So, to make the presentation this morning, to start the presentation, it's my pleasure to introduce for you Shanine Coates.

04:16:21.681 --> 04:16:28.864
Since Melanie went on maternity leave, Shanine has been serving as our acting division director.

04:16:29.284 --> 04:16:31.124
for the Improvement Accountability Division.

04:16:31.825 --> 04:16:39.307
Prior to that, she was working directly for me as the branch administrator for all of our divisions in our branch.

04:16:39.787 --> 04:16:43.067
And she's been very active in this system of support work.

04:16:43.448 --> 04:16:47.148
And so she's going to start our autumn off this afternoon.

04:16:48.929 --> 04:16:49.189
Suneet.

04:16:52.605 --> 04:16:55.427
Thank you, Carrick, members of the board.

04:16:55.527 --> 04:17:03.292
The goal for today is to walk us through sort of our system of support journey over the last 18 plus months.

04:17:04.773 --> 04:17:14.900
Give an eye into our path moving forward and really California's vision for the system of support and some emerging answers we have from the Budget Act provisions of 2018.

04:17:14.940 --> 04:17:21.705
And then walk through what's next in terms of year two planning and development.

04:17:23.167 --> 04:17:30.019
with a keen eye on county capacity building and our statewide communications and coordination efforts.

04:17:31.835 --> 04:17:37.459
So you have received nine updates regarding the system of support.

04:17:38.120 --> 04:17:40.301
The first being actually back in August 2016.

04:17:40.841 --> 04:17:53.891
I think that it's important when we talk about the system of support that we really talk about it in context with these three interconnected elements that are all related to our 10 state priorities.

04:17:54.011 --> 04:17:59.395
So the California School Dashboard, which we just had robust discussion around in item one.

04:17:59.975 --> 04:18:07.303
The local control accountability plans, which is where LEAs work with stakeholders to include goals, actions, and services.

04:18:07.403 --> 04:18:15.451
And then finally, the California system of support, which is responsive, designed to be responsive to the needs identified locally.

04:18:17.304 --> 04:18:24.832
This draft graphic is from CDE Press and Stephanie Gregson actually commissioned this.

04:18:25.392 --> 04:18:32.579
And in response to some requests that we had to present the system of support in a sort of friendlier manner.

04:18:33.060 --> 04:18:35.562
And so we're working on various materials.

04:18:35.602 --> 04:18:41.128
So this is just one draft graphic just to let you know that we are on that track and we have heard that call.

04:18:45.757 --> 04:18:52.322
Also to point out, that August 2016 memo is where we first identified that we would have three levels of support.

04:18:52.542 --> 04:19:09.515
So just to clarify, level one being support for all, that foundational support, level two for those LEAs identified for differentiated assistance, and then level three, which is coming soon, around intensive supports.

04:19:12.443 --> 04:19:21.392
So you've seen our goal, but I just want to just continue to point out that the system of support really is designed for each student.

04:19:21.692 --> 04:19:22.693
It's not one student.

04:19:22.753 --> 04:19:24.695
It's not some students.

04:19:25.036 --> 04:19:28.419
We're designing this to meet the needs of each student served.

04:19:28.479 --> 04:19:29.180
That's our goal.

04:19:29.800 --> 04:19:40.385
And it's focused around building the capacity, meaning what resources are responsive to the local needs to sustain improvement and effectively address inequities.

04:19:40.986 --> 04:19:49.830
And inequities being whatever unfairness or injustices are currently occurring with regards to student opportunities and outcomes.

04:19:51.591 --> 04:19:59.455
In June 2017, you saw an SPE memo that identified the framework for the system moving forward.

04:19:59.695 --> 04:20:05.137
And there we actually identified some key questions that have really guided the work.

04:20:05.898 --> 04:20:11.420
And I hope that as we go through this item, you'll see the connections here.

04:20:11.961 --> 04:20:16.283
So first, we wanted to know what structures are going to help us meet our goal.

04:20:16.923 --> 04:20:25.047
We wanted to know, second, how will agencies coordinate statewide while still remaining responsive to local needs?

04:20:25.827 --> 04:20:33.831
We wanted to know what research and past experience indicates would be most effective in terms of assisting student groups.

04:20:35.292 --> 04:20:38.934
We wanted to know what types of assistance educators would find helpful.

04:20:39.818 --> 04:20:54.285
how, excuse me, how we would advance the goal of building capacity, local capacity that is, and then finally how we were going to go about continuing to narrow and then close the achievement gaps and share successes so that could be done statewide.

04:20:56.184 --> 04:21:04.413
So what's our path moving forward and sort of what's the why behind the what before we get into the budget?

04:21:04.894 --> 04:21:09.980
So I'd like to submit that we've done a lot of work since the passage of LCFF.

04:21:10.761 --> 04:21:12.663
We have rolled out the dashboard.

04:21:12.903 --> 04:21:14.965
There have been modifications to the dashboard.

04:21:14.985 --> 04:21:15.326
We have

04:21:16.526 --> 04:21:21.768
local agencies and stakeholders surrounding around the LCAP and those goals, actions, and services.

04:21:22.228 --> 04:21:29.530
We have a statewide system of support planning team, which has grown to include our education and equity stakeholders.

04:21:30.411 --> 04:21:32.131
And we have this emerging system of support.

04:21:32.191 --> 04:21:37.593
And now we have a budget that is really providing some infrastructure to what we've been doing.

04:21:39.935 --> 04:21:40.676
So what's different?

04:21:41.316 --> 04:21:50.926
Well, we have at its core, our system really insists that local decision makers are owning this process, but we know they can't do it alone.

04:21:51.086 --> 04:21:53.388
We know that there's a collective responsibility.

04:21:55.470 --> 04:22:04.563
Put simply, the job of the support agencies is to help a district get the right resources at the right time, and that's responsive to their needs.

04:22:05.064 --> 04:22:10.812
And so that's really the shift that we're talking about as far as the approach to assistance.

04:22:11.232 --> 04:22:12.492
It's not someone else's job.

04:22:12.813 --> 04:22:13.753
It's all of our jobs.

04:22:14.173 --> 04:22:26.397
And if I, as a support partner, don't have the resource that an LEA is requiring, then it's my job to reach out and to connect that LEA with that resource that's going to be responsive to their needs.

04:22:26.737 --> 04:22:35.280
So that connection and that coordination piece is what we've built into the budget, what the legislature has built into the budget.

04:22:37.273 --> 04:22:38.574
So why is this different?

04:22:39.454 --> 04:22:45.737
Back in September 2017, we did lay out some research regarding our past efforts.

04:22:46.437 --> 04:22:53.781
And we found that, honestly, whether they were state or federal, there was a little bit of disjointedness.

04:22:54.661 --> 04:23:00.022
And so the plan now is that we're bringing it all together.

04:23:00.082 --> 04:23:01.263
We're putting it all in one.

04:23:01.503 --> 04:23:06.644
We don't want separate systems, separate regional systems, et cetera.

04:23:07.024 --> 04:23:09.544
We want them to work in concert with one another.

04:23:10.865 --> 04:23:13.865
So there's no wrong door to assistance.

04:23:14.345 --> 04:23:17.246
And again, the right resource at the right place at the right time.

04:23:25.149 --> 04:23:34.534
So I just want to go back one second and just say that our past efforts let us know that there was really something fundamental that needed to be changed.

04:23:35.514 --> 04:23:39.536
It's not that we necessarily needed better or different resources.

04:23:40.137 --> 04:23:46.660
We've created, California has quite a bit of resources that are available to LEAs.

04:23:47.080 --> 04:23:55.033
But what we noted is that there's a problem in connecting LEAs and schools to the resources that are available.

04:23:55.474 --> 04:24:00.022
And so that's really the issue that we were trying to solve.

04:24:06.064 --> 04:24:16.051
So it's been noted that county offices of education are the primary providers for a differentiated assistance.

04:24:16.391 --> 04:24:18.852
But when thinking through this, we have to consider a couple of things.

04:24:18.872 --> 04:24:22.755
So on one hand, an LEA shouldn't be required on its own

04:24:23.235 --> 04:24:39.782
to figure out the underlying cause of low performance, determine what's going to be a potential solution or response to that, locate that potential solution or response, and then finally adapt that solution or response to their local context.

04:24:40.243 --> 04:24:45.205
On the other hand, it's not necessarily feasible to think that

04:24:45.985 --> 04:24:51.527
every single county office of education, all 51 in the state, know exactly what's going on throughout the state.

04:24:51.827 --> 04:25:00.989
And so that's why the question came about, how does the system of support allow agencies charged with support to do their jobs?

04:25:01.409 --> 04:25:09.772
And so the state budget answers that, essentially, or begins to answer that, with the structure specifically which

04:25:11.172 --> 04:25:34.838
Defines roles and responsibilities throughout the state particularly around the geographic leads and as well as the expert leads providing a primary point of contact for for the County Office of Education or for the LEAs and then also allowing us as a state to identify what gaps and expertise exist and and fill those gaps and

04:25:38.075 --> 04:25:43.242
So the Budget Act provisions of 2018, we could say that they are in two buckets, if you may.

04:25:44.023 --> 04:25:55.097
One, which clarifies and enhances the existing roles and responsibilities, and then the other that provides the infrastructure to build capacity, to develop expertise, and to ensure coordination.

04:25:56.498 --> 04:26:01.580
So, this is a summary of the provisions that are related to the system of support.

04:26:02.920 --> 04:26:11.983
The item goes into them in detail, so I won't necessarily go into them in detail, but forthcoming, we will have a presentation regarding the lead agencies.

04:26:12.843 --> 04:26:20.526
and we'll also have additional information about how we're going to, what's next as far as coordination.

04:26:20.586 --> 04:26:21.907
So that will be coming to you.

04:26:21.987 --> 04:26:29.950
But if you do have specific questions about particular elements of this, we're here to, we can certainly answer those questions.

04:26:30.431 --> 04:26:37.093
I do want to point out that many of these are ongoing funding, whereas some past efforts were one-time funding.

04:26:38.174 --> 04:26:40.755
And so that is one change as well.

04:26:42.992 --> 04:26:52.135
So as part of the budget, in addition to the funding that's being provided, there are some key structures and statewide coordination that are required.

04:26:52.656 --> 04:27:09.402
So there's a formal communication process that's now required between the agencies, including the geographic lead agencies, the CDE, and the California Collaborative, which will also pull in the various expert leads throughout the state.

04:27:09.862 --> 04:27:14.183
And then there's also a formal stakeholder engagement process required.

04:27:14.203 --> 04:27:19.605
And then, as I mentioned before, existing initiatives will be linked in.

04:27:20.645 --> 04:27:27.587
For example, the Title III, county offices of education, multi-tiered system of support, et cetera.

04:27:30.373 --> 04:27:50.715
So the California Collaborative for Education, the California Department of Education, State Board and the Department, State Board staff and the Department of Finance worked together to develop the selection process for the geographic lead agencies, community engagement initiative, and the special education resource leads.

04:27:51.375 --> 04:28:01.083
And I would like to invite Suji Shin, the Chief of Staff for the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence, to join me to discuss the lead agency selection process.

04:28:01.343 --> 04:28:01.704
Thank you.

04:28:01.724 --> 04:28:05.507
Good afternoon, Board.

04:28:05.527 --> 04:28:08.309
Suji Shin with the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence.

04:28:09.250 --> 04:28:09.470
Sorry.

04:28:10.302 --> 04:28:11.282
Good afternoon, board.

04:28:11.742 --> 04:28:14.583
Suji Shin with the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence.

04:28:15.283 --> 04:28:33.027
And as Shanine provided a framework for the overall system of support, I'm going to be diving in a little bit specifically and talking about some updates to the selection process for three key lead agencies as part of this process within the system of support.

04:28:33.708 --> 04:28:38.729
And the first are the geographic lead agencies, which in the RFA are

04:28:39.569 --> 04:28:58.647
Noted as lead agencies and so that is the sort of shorthand that you'll be seeing here The lead agency central goals as you see outlined in front of you are really to think about supporting how we support county offices And their districts to support the continuous improvement of student performance within their state priorities across student groups

04:28:59.387 --> 04:29:18.926
to really think about how we are addressing achievement gaps between student groups and ultimately improving outreach and collaboration with stakeholders and engaging in deeper engagement processes to really ensure that the services, goals, and actions described in their LCAPs really do reflect the needs of that local context, especially for the historically underrepresented.

04:29:19.366 --> 04:29:20.847
and low achieving populations.

04:29:21.367 --> 04:29:32.675
And to support these goals, the RFA currently that is out, outlines a process by which we'll be selecting six to ten geographic leads across the state to carry on these roles.

04:29:33.556 --> 04:29:38.419
The responsibility of the lead agencies in this context are threefold.

04:29:38.659 --> 04:29:45.764
One is to sort of think about how they are facilitating conversations and work across the counties that they are serving.

04:29:46.245 --> 04:29:47.826
To think about how they are

04:29:48.266 --> 04:29:55.810
identifying existing, creating new resources as needed and connecting those resources across districts within their geographic catchment.

04:29:56.610 --> 04:30:09.296
And then thirdly, thinking about how they are really acting as a hub and a kind of a lead in that kind of capacity building of their districts to support the needs of their students.

04:30:10.276 --> 04:30:20.259
As I said, the proposals are, the RFA is currently open and proposals are due on the 20th of this month with the selection process occurring in October.

04:30:23.120 --> 04:30:30.842
The second of these, the second of these agency, lead agency processes is the Community Engagement Initiative.

04:30:31.262 --> 04:30:38.024
And that is a series of multi-year professional learning networks that build on district and community capacity to collaborate together

04:30:38.604 --> 04:30:40.726
with a focus on improving student outcomes.

04:30:42.227 --> 04:30:48.371
There are really four purposes or intents around the community engagement initiative.

04:30:48.831 --> 04:31:01.060
One is to really think about how we are building capacity in communities and districts to have difficult conversations, to engage in more deeper meaningful engagement with their stakeholders with a focus on improving student outcomes.

04:31:01.620 --> 04:31:14.923
Second is to really think about, through this process over the next several years, how we might identify effective models of community engagement that are highlighted up through this process, as well as the metrics to evaluate those models.

04:31:16.084 --> 04:31:29.927
Third is in thinking about how we develop effective peer-to-peer partnerships between districts and county offices based on the CCE's professional learning network structure to ultimately deepen community engagement at that local level.

04:31:30.487 --> 04:31:46.178
And then fourth is as a part through this process over the next six years, thinking about how we scale up this work to ultimately improve community engagement across the state, incorporate practices that really prove effective towards district and county office continuous improvement efforts.

04:31:46.839 --> 04:31:53.143
The RFA on this is out and was due on or is due at the end of this month as well.

04:31:54.684 --> 04:32:02.429
And then the third of the lead agency processes I'd like to sort of discuss with you today are the special education resource leads.

04:32:03.149 --> 04:32:11.995
And this work is really focused on strengthening differentiated assistance provided to LEAs with a focus on improving the outcomes for our students with disabilities.

04:32:12.815 --> 04:32:32.974
And the focus of this work will be identifying, coordinating, and calibrating services that help ultimately support the system's alignment across our state, that deal with supporting students with disabilities, how we incorporate evidence-based practices that ultimately demonstrate positive outcomes for students with disabilities.

04:32:34.485 --> 04:32:39.748
There will be two types of special education resource leads that will be identified through this process.

04:32:40.229 --> 04:32:44.692
And the first of these is the CellBus Systems Improvement Lead.

04:32:45.632 --> 04:32:53.938
In this way, we are identifying a group of leads that will be applying as a partnership of three to four lead CellBus.

04:32:54.618 --> 04:33:05.445
That will focus on capacity building through the training, the use of data, best practices, and evidence-based practices in root cause analysis, systems alignment, and coherence.

04:33:05.465 --> 04:33:11.609
So again, we're really thinking about the systems alignment piece and the infrastructure around this work to support our students with disabilities.

04:33:12.290 --> 04:33:18.314
The second type of special education resource leads, or the SELPA leads, will be the SELPA content lead.

04:33:18.994 --> 04:33:35.121
And in this role, we are going to be identifying leads, county or SELPAs, that currently exhibit existing expertise in establishing systems, data practices, using cycles of improvement, as well as expertise in one of nine identified areas.

04:33:35.161 --> 04:33:39.123
And these include things like increasing access to inclusive environments,

04:33:39.543 --> 04:34:02.140
increasing access to quality curriculum and instruction, increasing strengthening early childhood preschool opportunities, improving transition services, increasing graduation rates with a diploma, reducing suspension expulsion, improving and increasing family engagement, reducing disproportionality across all areas, and improving support for English learners with disabilities.

04:34:05.345 --> 04:34:21.111
So quickly across the sort of three sets of leads, we are looking at, in September, the geographic and community engagement applications being due, and the SELPA lead application being released for the systems improvement piece.

04:34:21.571 --> 04:34:28.174
In October and November, the lead agencies will be selected, and we anticipate kicking this off in the winter this year.

04:34:29.014 --> 04:34:38.694
So with that, I'm going to hand it off to Jason Willis with WestEd, who is going to talk a little bit more about next steps and some of our work around communication across our agency system.

04:34:43.959 --> 04:34:48.424
Shanina was going to do the intro, but Suji scooped her.

04:34:49.304 --> 04:34:53.569
Good afternoon, President Kirst, Superintendent Torlakson, members of the board.

04:34:54.550 --> 04:34:56.331
As Suji had mentioned, my name is Jason Willis.

04:34:56.452 --> 04:34:57.793
I'm a director with WestEd.

04:34:57.813 --> 04:35:02.398
And I'm up here today actually representing the California Comprehensive Center.

04:35:03.755 --> 04:35:17.565
We were asked by the State Board of Education to help facilitate the kind of envisioned coordination and collaboration amongst the state agencies as they pursue the kind of design, build and implementation of this system of support.

04:35:18.286 --> 04:35:29.734
So today, as Janine had prefaced before, just want to touch on some of the year two planning and development and give a little bit of context for some of those comments before we dive a little bit deeper.

04:35:31.365 --> 04:35:40.328
So this is a look at currently all of the represented organizations and agencies at the system of support planning meetings.

04:35:40.688 --> 04:35:46.130
We have between 30 and 40 folks that will show up every other month for these meetings.

04:35:46.690 --> 04:35:59.294
A large majority of them, I would say, near 75% or 80% are consistent attendees, which is an important indicator for us as we think about the consistency and people understanding the history and development and participation in this work.

04:36:00.374 --> 04:36:02.376
I'll point out a couple of distinctions here.

04:36:02.896 --> 04:36:12.184
At the very top are the state agencies here in California that are considered the kind of primary purveyors of helping to design, build, and implement the systems.

04:36:12.224 --> 04:36:19.491
You've got the State Board of Ed, the Department of Education, the CCEE, and the representative county agencies, CESA.

04:36:20.987 --> 04:36:31.695
Those set of icons, logos in the middle, really represent the mix of both education advocate organizations as well as education associations that attend these sessions.

04:36:32.295 --> 04:36:36.999
Importantly for the education associations, one of the requirements that we have for the planning group

04:36:37.559 --> 04:36:46.805
is that they not only send a staff member, which, you know, if they're here in Sacramento, they can consistently attend, but they also bring a sitting member representative.

04:36:46.925 --> 04:36:49.667
So if I'm from CSBA, I'm bringing a board member.

04:36:49.707 --> 04:37:05.998
If I'm from CTA, I'm bringing a teacher, so on and so forth, which really kind of leads into that last set of logos you see there at the bottom, is that we think it's paramount, and particularly the state agencies think it's paramount importance, to ensure that practitioners are in the room.

04:37:07.038 --> 04:37:19.222
These are the folks on the front line that are implementing this work and ensuring that their voice is in the room as state agencies consider the configuration of the ways in which they're deploying resources is important to the state agencies.

04:37:19.742 --> 04:37:26.845
And so incorporating their voice, not just during the meeting, but also in some of the items that we go through is also really important.

04:37:30.208 --> 04:37:40.706
So one of the things that we have consistently opened the planning group meetings up with is this diagram, and this is really indicative of the direction that

04:37:41.860 --> 04:37:46.202
the state board of education, the other agencies really want to move.

04:37:46.962 --> 04:37:55.805
That in years past, there has been almost outright competition that's existed between state agencies, resources, time, attention, et cetera.

04:37:56.785 --> 04:38:02.047
And that we progressively want to be able to move along a continuum where they are communicating more regularly.

04:38:02.067 --> 04:38:09.030
And those structures that have been set up through the planning group and some work group structures, I'll talk about a little bit later, have helped to push that along.

04:38:10.130 --> 04:38:11.711
into coordination, right?

04:38:11.751 --> 04:38:20.794
So you're able to actually start coordinating the work and the resources you are using to help support, in this case, districts and district leadership and their work with schools and teachers in the classroom.

04:38:21.634 --> 04:38:24.735
And finally, arriving at this notion of collaboration, that this is

04:38:25.715 --> 04:38:37.621
penultimate place that you would want to be in, which you can see in that kind of very brief working definition that two or more people, a team, are working together in a very coherent process towards a shared set of goals.

04:38:38.202 --> 04:38:40.123
So the planning group has a set of goals.

04:38:41.497 --> 04:38:48.146
And the state agencies and the associated organizations and practitioners have been moving towards them.

04:38:48.607 --> 04:38:52.332
And we've seen some certain progress over the course of the last year with this group.

04:38:53.093 --> 04:38:58.099
And that has been reflected in the year one feedback that we were collecting both from

04:38:58.940 --> 04:39:01.063
state agencies, but also from districts and counties.

04:39:01.764 --> 04:39:12.119
So looking forward to year two of continuing to deepen that by really bringing to the fore some issues that the field has brought to the planning group as things that need to be addressed.

04:39:13.399 --> 04:39:29.205
So as a means to help create that vehicle and to create that action, the planning group designed five work groups that were all geared in large part around the needs that were emerging out of the year one feedback.

04:39:30.441 --> 04:39:37.847
And I'm going to focus on the first two in a little bit more depth, but want to give you a sense of all five of these different areas.

04:39:38.208 --> 04:39:45.154
And I'll talk a little bit more since I'm going to go into communications and county capacity, more about support for all, intensive support, and bright spots.

04:39:45.774 --> 04:39:51.957
So the Support for All Level 1 really has been one of the most recent workgroups to get up and running.

04:39:52.757 --> 04:40:08.304
In fact, the October planning session that is coming up in just under a month will focus almost exclusively on how state agencies and other organizations are thinking about these Supports for All and these Level 1 resources.

04:40:08.504 --> 04:40:12.406
And interestingly, in one of the workgroup sessions, this notion of

04:40:13.266 --> 04:40:31.941
perhaps changing the lens upon which we're thinking about support for all had come up, that perhaps it's not about necessarily capturing an entire universe of resources that are out there, but perhaps it's good to focus on mindset and the way that people are thinking about coordinating support to districts as a place to start, right?

04:40:31.981 --> 04:40:35.443
So start, get some early wins before you can progress forward.

04:40:36.164 --> 04:40:46.531
The intensive support for level three, a lot of their work has primarily focused on what I would describe as kind of early warning indicators.

04:40:47.112 --> 04:40:54.336
So one of the realizations that this work group has been coming around to is that if you are looking to intervene with a district that's in that much

04:40:56.230 --> 04:41:00.552
they were confronted by that many challenges, that we should be getting there earlier.

04:41:00.632 --> 04:41:07.855
And there's probably things that we can identify that would allow us to know that they are already on that path and should be getting to them sooner.

04:41:07.915 --> 04:41:13.217
And so this notion of kind of blending level two and three has started to come up.

04:41:13.697 --> 04:41:18.159
And some research at a kind of in-person session will be presented next week.

04:41:18.959 --> 04:41:31.028
talking about this field of early warning indicators that's been popularized in large part out of the University of Chicago, but has also been picked up in places like New York City and other states across the country.

04:41:31.989 --> 04:41:35.271
And Bright Spots is the last of the five work groups.

04:41:35.652 --> 04:41:40.856
Just briefly to touch on that, that this work is evolving what we have

04:41:41.596 --> 04:41:51.666
had tried to do under NCLB in identifying those places, schools, districts, different programs and practices that have been effective in driving student achievement.

04:41:51.886 --> 04:42:06.119
And one of the big lessons learned in our research review out of those previous efforts is that many of the schools or school districts that were identified, when you dig in a little bit deeper, it was almost more randomness.

04:42:06.860 --> 04:42:08.601
than it was actually systematic.

04:42:08.841 --> 04:42:18.624
And so one of the things that kind of reflects the principles of this work that the state and the state agencies are trying to support with districts is a systems approach.

04:42:18.924 --> 04:42:26.446
That is that you're doing things very intentionally and you're doing it with a purpose that gets you an intended outcome.

04:42:27.307 --> 04:42:34.709
And so the bright spots allows the state to not only tend to those that really do need the support, but also to raise up those

04:42:35.389 --> 04:42:46.791
school districts and schools that can offer some insight for populations they're working with in circumstances that might be similar enough to other districts and other schools that they can really adopt those practices.

04:42:46.851 --> 04:42:58.654
And again, thinking about this from the perspective of how is the system organized itself to create routines in which they can better predict those interventions and the outcomes that students are getting.

04:43:00.512 --> 04:43:03.514
So I want to go a little bit deeper on the County Capacity Workgroup.

04:43:03.594 --> 04:43:10.798
There's been two primary efforts that have driven the County Capacities Workgroup over the course of the last five or six months.

04:43:10.838 --> 04:43:15.141
And again, this comes from the feedback that was presented to the state agencies in June.

04:43:16.421 --> 04:43:32.826
First and foremost, that this notion of an improvement capacity framework, there seems to be some consensus in the planning group that while there's a lot of effort and a lot of resources that have now been put into the system to expect in a matter of, sorry,

04:43:36.041 --> 04:43:42.003
in a matter of six or nine months to have student outcomes turn around as a result of that support is unrealistic.

04:43:42.763 --> 04:43:50.026
And so one of the things that the planning group has been wrestling with is coming up with some frame to understand what are the things could we measure?

04:43:50.046 --> 04:43:56.668
What are the things could we raise up that would show the work that state agencies and the county offices are doing with other adults?

04:43:57.830 --> 04:44:02.712
With few exception, the work that state agencies and county offices of ed do are with other adults.

04:44:02.952 --> 04:44:03.973
They are not with students.

04:44:04.573 --> 04:44:08.694
So part of that work is trying to figure out how do we measure that effort?

04:44:09.195 --> 04:44:10.915
How do we measure the changes that are occurring?

04:44:10.935 --> 04:44:20.099
And again, going back to the system, this approach for this work, that if you can measure in some way that work, that it would allow us to give us a dipstick.

04:44:20.159 --> 04:44:24.581
So we're certainly not talking about adding an indicator to the dashboard.

04:44:25.061 --> 04:44:35.089
But this is, again, more about a formative effort so that other adults, as they're thinking about their levels of support to districts, that they have a lens through which they can think through in that regard.

04:44:37.178 --> 04:44:38.739
Interim progress, I mentioned that.

04:44:39.499 --> 04:44:45.880
And I think another kind of point here is just having that common language around abilities, skills, and mindsets of individuals and organizations.

04:44:45.920 --> 04:45:00.284
That there's a common, loose way in which individuals can talk about this work, county to county, state agency to state agency, as they're thinking about how they can continue to orient their time and attention to school districts.

04:45:01.084 --> 04:45:08.794
The second piece of this, and this builds on the work that we started last year around the formal feedback plan was kind of year one.

04:45:09.515 --> 04:45:19.647
So we're continuing to refine the measurement and the criteria and the questions that we're asking, a lot of which is actually based in the improvement capacity framework.

04:45:20.548 --> 04:45:41.652
So continuing, again, this notion of this isn't evaluative in nature, it's more formative, and that one of the things that we are looking to see is that the state agencies and counties subsequently are feeding on this information as places that they need to continue to focus in their own work, as opposed to, you know, you're getting a passing or a failing grade around this work.

04:45:42.052 --> 04:45:49.513
So again, continuing to emphasize this notion of using cycles of inquiry to drive the work and process that state agencies are doing.

04:45:51.653 --> 04:45:56.016
The second work group that I'll go into a little bit of detail about is the communications work group.

04:45:56.256 --> 04:46:03.281
Once again, a very kind of clear need that came up out of the year one feedback that we were receiving.

04:46:04.082 --> 04:46:12.628
Many practitioners that we talked to, both those that were identified for level two differentiated assistance, but actually more of those that were not,

04:46:13.448 --> 04:46:16.112
didn't have a sense of what the system of support was.

04:46:16.653 --> 04:46:26.125
And as we think about things like level one resources, as we think about this as being a critical structure for helping and supporting implementation in our schools and districts,

04:46:27.054 --> 04:46:39.139
whether you are getting a type of support from the system or not, understanding what it is, what it's there for, and how it can support you as a district leader or a school leader is critical.

04:46:39.419 --> 04:46:50.424
And so the communications work group has developed a communications plan, kind of aims to build this awareness and clarity and ownership, particularly amongst education stakeholders.

04:46:50.984 --> 04:46:58.850
excuse me, education stakeholders within the sector, but also to create some cohesion and collaboration in our communication outreach efforts.

04:46:59.390 --> 04:47:02.212
I was talking with one of the planning group meetings earlier today.

04:47:02.232 --> 04:47:07.636
We were just kind of talking about a logistic of presenting some of these talking points and common PowerPoint slides.

04:47:08.156 --> 04:47:19.845
And I said, it'd be great to be able to get to the point where you could swap out any member of the planning group, didn't matter who they were from, what agency, and they could basically provide and give the same type of information about where the system is.

04:47:20.545 --> 04:47:26.508
That's part of the kind of inspiration and vision of where particularly the communications work group is trying to go.

04:47:27.128 --> 04:47:40.175
And so some of the key documents include talking points on several relevant topics, both specific to the systems of support, but also in relationship to other things, like the LCFF, or sorry, the LCAP, the dashboard, et cetera.

04:47:40.935 --> 04:47:47.779
A glossary of terms, again, to have in your back pocket, and this notion of kind of common slides and accompanying talking points.

04:47:48.419 --> 04:47:55.342
So one of the things that this work group has laid out for the fall is that there are many associations that are in the room.

04:47:55.382 --> 04:48:01.245
They host conferences, events that literally are triple and quadruple booked throughout the course of the fall.

04:48:01.265 --> 04:48:02.426
We're kind of getting into that season.

04:48:03.306 --> 04:48:08.829
And so it was the decision of the work group not to say, we want to put on our own events, but really to take advantage of

04:48:09.349 --> 04:48:10.310
those that are in the room.

04:48:11.290 --> 04:48:15.253
And I have to say, the planning group has stepped up in no small measure.

04:48:15.713 --> 04:48:30.503
We actually have, this work group now has a very detailed calendar by month between now and the end of the year that identifies each of the state agencies, organizations, associations that are in the planning group, and then what thing they are doing by month.

04:48:31.044 --> 04:48:36.927
So again, this is taking advantage of already existing vehicles, like conferences, newsletters, blogs,

04:48:40.070 --> 04:48:45.434
other articles, for example, that allow us to push this information out to a broader audience.

04:48:47.656 --> 04:48:48.257
So what's next?

04:48:48.817 --> 04:48:55.223
I talked, you know, you heard from Suji from CC about the lead selection, design of communication and coordination expectations.

04:48:55.743 --> 04:48:59.827
I talked about the communication rollout for the fall, the formal feedback and improvement capacity framework.

04:49:00.187 --> 04:49:04.751
The last thing I'll note is just the work that county offices of ed are gearing up to.

04:49:05.371 --> 04:49:06.311
to do for year two.

04:49:06.451 --> 04:49:10.973
I think one of the very common questions that have come up is what comes next.

04:49:11.513 --> 04:49:19.416
The root cause analysis was something that was certainly a very innovative and forward-thinking notion that counties have advanced with school districts.

04:49:19.476 --> 04:49:24.798
We saw that many districts really appreciated that different tone that counties were bringing to districts.

04:49:25.298 --> 04:49:29.580
And I think right after that conversation ended, people started asking, well, what's going to happen next?

04:49:30.300 --> 04:49:49.596
And so counties have been organizing and thinking about how this continued engagement with districts can be done in a way that's consistent with the principles of not necessarily imposing this work on districts, but really listening for the needs that they have and identifying and pairing the right set of resources with those districts appropriately.

04:49:50.276 --> 04:50:06.938
Concretely, CISC, which is the Curriculum Instruction Subcommittee of CCESA, has an item on their agenda next Thursday that is specific to talking through both the data collection and organization of this work for year two.

04:50:07.938 --> 04:50:14.343
There are lots of things that we would want to continue to collect some information about to kind of feed that back to the state agencies and counties.

04:50:15.143 --> 04:50:18.065
And so, CISC will be having that kind of open collaborative conversation.

04:50:18.746 --> 04:50:25.491
And that will then subsequently flow to the SESASA general membership meeting that will be occurring in October.

04:50:26.331 --> 04:50:33.156
So, the sequence, which is something also that the state agencies have been working on, you know, CISC is going to have their session.

04:50:33.896 --> 04:50:35.818
The planning group will have their meeting in early October.

04:50:36.338 --> 04:50:39.919
general membership will have their, for success, will have their meeting in mid-October.

04:50:40.339 --> 04:50:46.401
And so we want to try and see a much more consistent flow of information back and forth across these kind of critical meetings.

04:50:46.981 --> 04:51:02.325
And then the last thing I'll mention is that the counties, particularly staff in the counties, have seen a really great response to improvement science training, which I would describe as a methodology of continuous improvements, not the only one out there, but it is certainly one that

04:51:03.306 --> 04:51:04.747
many county offices have adopted.

04:51:05.067 --> 04:51:19.101
And one of the things that WestEd has seen across the state and has started to emerge is this discipline, not only of wanting to use continuous improvement as a vehicle to support districts, but also thinking outside of just a single methodology.

04:51:19.501 --> 04:51:27.189
So we now have county offices that will borrow heavily from things like improvement science, but are also bringing in other methodologies as a means to adapt it

04:51:27.809 --> 04:51:28.830
into their own environment.

04:51:28.890 --> 04:51:32.872
So I think we're set up and poised for some great work in year two.

04:51:33.532 --> 04:51:41.296
Still very much in a conceptual design and build phase, but excited to see what happens with this coming school year.

04:51:41.996 --> 04:51:44.678
So I think with that, Sheena is right behind me.

04:51:45.118 --> 04:51:45.358
Thank you.

04:51:48.885 --> 04:51:49.346
Thank you.

04:51:49.966 --> 04:51:51.949
So this is an informational item.

04:51:52.309 --> 04:52:01.160
So I will, if you have questions or comments, I have a team of colleagues behind me that are here to assist with that.

04:52:04.421 --> 04:52:07.362
I want to thank you and the team Jason and Suji for coming.

04:52:07.962 --> 04:52:22.066
I know that there's a bunch of decisions coming up that CCE will be involved in and choosing the lead agencies and I guess I would like this is an ongoing item and obviously it's continuing to develop and I appreciated Jason's description of the

04:52:22.546 --> 04:52:26.908
different ways the players interact, because I think that's what the field is now wondering about.

04:52:27.028 --> 04:52:31.791
So and I guess I would like the next step when the team is ready to present.

04:52:31.831 --> 04:52:32.731
So what happens?

04:52:32.751 --> 04:52:37.294
So I'm in technical assistance and I'm getting support from my county.

04:52:38.254 --> 04:52:41.476
But what if I really would rather go to a different agency?

04:52:42.116 --> 04:52:43.977
When do I go to CCEE?

04:52:44.197 --> 04:52:46.318
Are they the broker for other services?

04:52:46.378 --> 04:52:47.819
Will people be working for them?

04:52:48.199 --> 04:52:58.824
You don't have to answer those things now, but what I'm saying is I'd like to see the next chapter, and I know you're all working on these pieces and it's complicated, but maybe as the new leads are selected,

04:52:59.344 --> 04:53:03.308
And I know you didn't have county office people here today because some of them are applying for the leads.

04:53:03.788 --> 04:53:14.177
So I guess I'd love to see a county office exemplar or what that is, how CC, maybe Tom Marolino, our new executive director, could come and that we could see the next chapter.

04:53:14.338 --> 04:53:17.060
OK, because people are saying, OK, I'm in technical assistance.

04:53:17.500 --> 04:53:21.324
So what's happening or where can I go or?

04:53:21.844 --> 04:53:22.965
What if I want this one?

04:53:23.545 --> 04:53:25.365
Is this for free and do I pay for that?

04:53:25.425 --> 04:53:27.066
So I'm just putting out the questions.

04:53:27.106 --> 04:53:36.050
I appreciate this as a foundation of continuing to inform us, but I'd like to request in November that we have that next chapter on the presentation.

04:53:36.070 --> 04:53:36.770
Thank you.

04:53:40.334 --> 04:53:40.735
Thank you.

04:53:40.755 --> 04:53:45.639
I just wanted to express my appreciation to everybody for the presentation.

04:53:46.780 --> 04:53:58.531
As Eileen mentioned, our new executive director for CCE, Tom Armolino, who's the former Shasta County superintendent, former president of AXA, came on board in

04:54:00.052 --> 04:54:02.433
the first part of July and has really hit the ground running.

04:54:02.453 --> 04:54:08.815
And I would like, he's going to be here in November to do more of a presentation about where we're headed with CCEE.

04:54:09.435 --> 04:54:21.519
The one thing, a couple things I want to reinforce about this is A, there's a substantial investment from the state in trying to build out the system of support, which we very much appreciate from the governor and the legislature.

04:54:22.059 --> 04:54:28.541
But with that brings a number of challenges in my view, because when you look at all of the different leads,

04:54:30.142 --> 04:54:43.492
I've said this to Dave, he doesn't like this expression, but I worry that we're moving from what was an old shame and blame situation system under NCLB to we're now going to love LEAs to death.

04:54:43.952 --> 04:54:47.836
And we're going to give them somebody from special ed, and we're going to give them somebody from this.

04:54:48.576 --> 04:54:50.377
And the LEAs are going to be going, wait a minute.

04:54:50.917 --> 04:54:59.160
But Dave assures me that's not the way it's supposed to work and that it's actually supposed to be coordinated through the system of support and primarily through the county offices.

04:54:59.560 --> 04:55:08.363
That the county offices are really the, you know, first stop, if you will, to say, let's figure out what's going on here and let's figure out what kind of help you need.

04:55:08.723 --> 04:55:11.284
And then we'll be there to help you get that help.

04:55:11.744 --> 04:55:17.266
But it is a work in progress, and I think we're going to have to be very attentive to that.

04:55:18.166 --> 04:55:25.489
The third thing I wanted to mention, and I think somebody, I can't remember if it was Suji or Shanine, alluded to level three, which is intensive support.

04:55:26.409 --> 04:55:41.369
And lo and behold, there are already districts that we consider to be in level three and they're primarily districts that are in severe economic distress and or used to be called bankrupt districts that have come to the state for loans.

04:55:42.129 --> 04:55:59.815
And so in addition to the funding for this big system, the CCEE now has been thrust into a very prominent role along with FCMAT and in partnership with our other state system folks around these districts, Englewood being the first one.

04:56:00.595 --> 04:56:02.056
There's a couple right behind them.

04:56:02.591 --> 04:56:07.592
where the CCEE has been asked to go in immediately to those districts.

04:56:07.632 --> 04:56:09.773
So I think it's important to kind of understand that.

04:56:10.533 --> 04:56:18.296
I'll just say for me as the chair of CCEE, I get very nervous about that work because it's very intensive work and it's long term.

04:56:18.936 --> 04:56:22.797
And I worry a lot about pulling CCEE away from

04:56:23.477 --> 04:56:29.039
the level two assistance, which is what I think initially was contemplated for them, at least initially.

04:56:29.119 --> 04:56:34.040
So just a little preview of what we can expect to hear in November.

04:56:34.801 --> 04:56:37.441
But I really appreciate all the work that you all have been doing.

04:56:37.481 --> 04:56:42.823
And I think, just I will say, having watched it over the last year or so, or maybe a little bit longer,

04:56:43.463 --> 04:56:58.918
It really has evolved a lot, and I think we're getting a lot more clear on what the respective roles are going to be, what kinds of services LEAs are going to need, and how those will be coordinated so they don't feel like they're being bombarded by a bunch of different folks.

04:57:04.758 --> 04:57:29.592
Originally, the Charter School Act was, I believe, a foundational piece of it would be that these schools would experiment with various approaches to education and provide examples of high quality education and disseminate that out into the general public school system.

04:57:31.489 --> 04:57:47.532
The Charter School Act has actually provided a great deal of choice for parents, but it has not done a very good job, or the charter school movement has not done a very good job of disseminating model practices and sharing that with a wide variety of public schools.

04:57:47.992 --> 04:57:55.254
So because this is still in the conceptual system planning time of support and all,

04:57:56.354 --> 04:58:07.879
It might be helpful to take a look again about how charter, I was pleased to see the CCSA is on their logos there somewhere.

04:58:07.939 --> 04:58:09.720
I don't know what that means, but their logo is there.

04:58:10.500 --> 04:58:14.381
But I think there could be a way of thinking about

04:58:15.822 --> 04:58:26.475
charter schools and those that are exceeding expectations, and there are some, and how that could be useful or helpful in this process.

04:58:33.666 --> 04:58:36.569
Thank you all for the work that you've done to put this together.

04:58:37.089 --> 04:58:51.264
With each successive board meeting, when your division comes to make the presentation, one of the things I'm always listening for is not just the concern about creating and developing the capacity of the LEAs,

04:58:51.764 --> 04:59:01.714
But also, I want to know that there is consideration in the planning and implementation of this about the capacity of the support providers.

04:59:02.275 --> 04:59:07.060
And so as we go, I'm comfortable knowing that this is a work in progress.

04:59:07.580 --> 04:59:17.546
The fact of the matter is all of the work that has been done before this new system to provide support for schools, frankly, just didn't work.

04:59:17.586 --> 04:59:19.407
And it was always a work in progress.

04:59:19.767 --> 04:59:22.069
We just never owned that it wasn't working.

04:59:22.449 --> 04:59:30.554
So I'm happy to see this as a work in progress, because as long as we recognize that, it means that we're going to be paying attention

04:59:31.034 --> 04:59:39.798
not only to the building blocks, but what are the essential next steps to take and what they are, what those next steps are going to be defined by.

04:59:39.818 --> 04:59:58.306
And so what I really want to make sure I reiterate, as I have done each time Melanie has come to the board to make this presentation and bring county offices up, it's very important for us to continue to hear that part of that consideration are what are the building blocks for capacity,

04:59:58.786 --> 05:00:00.988
for the providers as well.

05:00:01.468 --> 05:00:13.939
Because we know that differentiated types of support doesn't mean that there's going to be one single system of support provided by a single provider for all the LEAs that they contract with or consult with.

05:00:14.339 --> 05:00:20.003
So I want to understand what that capacity building for them looks like as well.

05:00:20.383 --> 05:00:36.895
And it continues to be important to hear not just bounded by the issues of funding, but also the issues of personnel access and the types of resources that they make connections to or create linkages for, but also what they do for their own internal capacity development.

05:00:37.215 --> 05:00:41.678
I think that remains an important consideration concern that is very important to hear.

05:00:42.339 --> 05:00:42.599
Thank you.

05:00:45.276 --> 05:00:46.717
Okay, Board Member Ortiz-Lacon.

05:00:51.061 --> 05:00:51.361
Thank you.

05:00:51.381 --> 05:00:59.769
This was a very thorough presentation and I think that just breaking out of silos and communicating across agencies is a goal and a very lofty goal.

05:01:00.789 --> 05:01:07.896
I am a little concerned that as we're trying to build a capacity, we're trying to break the silos and figure out communication.

05:01:08.676 --> 05:01:24.881
that we may focus so much, and with some of the districts having been in physical crisis, that we're going to focus so much on building this thing and not really focus on why we're building it, which is to address student outcomes and performance, right?

05:01:25.301 --> 05:01:31.523
And so I like that we have some measures that we want to consider when looking at the capacity that we're building.

05:01:32.203 --> 05:01:38.209
But I also think that we need to consider at what point are we now looking at what we're building?

05:01:38.530 --> 05:01:44.275
Is it having an impact with student outcomes and the interim growth targets that we have?

05:01:44.295 --> 05:01:47.778
And we have those on the SSA state plan dug in somewhere.

05:01:47.798 --> 05:01:55.986
I was at an event at Stanford last week with state local state board members and no one had seen the SSA state plan.

05:01:56.807 --> 05:02:00.509
And so I really doubt that people are looking at the estate plan to look at their targets.

05:02:01.089 --> 05:02:01.329
Right.

05:02:01.669 --> 05:02:06.471
So I think it's important for for us to quickly focus on how do we build it?

05:02:06.531 --> 05:02:07.432
How do we sustain it?

05:02:07.492 --> 05:02:08.432
How do we support it?

05:02:08.492 --> 05:02:13.214
Because at some point we may not have all the funding that is currently funding this.

05:02:13.295 --> 05:02:17.476
And if we do it right, the funding should phase out little by little, but not completely.

05:02:18.877 --> 05:02:25.921
But at the same time, how do we then focus on the reason we're building this entire system, which is student performance, and what does that look like?

05:02:26.281 --> 05:02:39.568
And when we're having these honest or courageous conversations, I would like to know what is in that courageous conversation, because there are some things that may hint at just attitudes towards students.

05:02:39.708 --> 05:02:46.031
The other thing that I heard a lot last week was, well, let's look at performance, but then next to it, let's look at poverty.

05:02:46.671 --> 05:02:52.295
It's like, yes, we all know that poverty contributes and makes it challenging, but it's not a destination.

05:02:52.575 --> 05:02:56.337
And we need to break away from that idea that if you're poor, therefore you will not succeed.

05:02:57.017 --> 05:03:02.581
And that's something that I don't know what map or what theory of action will get to that.

05:03:03.061 --> 05:03:03.381
Thank you.

05:03:03.401 --> 05:03:06.783
Thank you.

05:03:06.843 --> 05:03:07.404
Board Member Valdez.

05:03:09.480 --> 05:03:22.264
So I like the idea, and I really appreciate it, that we're not going to compete against one another, that we are going to complete in terms of all of those agencies and entities that were on that one slide.

05:03:23.905 --> 05:03:27.726
You know, there's that song from Greece, We Go Together, Shananana ding dong, you know that one.

05:03:28.546 --> 05:03:36.730
But that's really going to be important because as a consumer, as a district level person, and I'm looking for support, it's still not clear where to go.

05:03:36.750 --> 05:03:37.911
And I know that that's coming.

05:03:38.011 --> 05:03:49.397
And my fear is that the dashboard comes at the beginning of December and then districts are doing, you know, they probably already know, but then they're going to think of what do they need to do.

05:03:49.497 --> 05:03:52.298
And I think we're making those decisions, I think, in January.

05:03:52.338 --> 05:03:52.859
So there's this

05:03:53.419 --> 05:04:15.608
this time period where I think if we could get out the most information possible to be clear about the roles so that districts have enough detail that we could give them at that point that would really help the journey so that we don't create a sense of panic, people don't go out shopping, that they kind of know that it can be very intentional and we can do some really good work together.

05:04:15.688 --> 05:04:17.929
So I think that's really important.

05:04:17.969 --> 05:04:18.949
And I also think that

05:04:19.669 --> 05:04:38.625
You know with the differentiated assistance the state Accountability if you will and then with the federal accountability coming at the school level that that needs to get clarified as well Within what would be the role then with all of these agencies within that still working through the county probably but yet all of that needs to get Communicated out.

05:04:38.986 --> 05:04:47.593
I think that there's just a lot of people who don't even understand that it's coming Okay board member Karnas

05:04:48.645 --> 05:04:49.866
Thank you for your presentation.

05:04:50.966 --> 05:04:56.168
So one of the things I really hope that happens during the design process is really having student voice included.

05:04:56.228 --> 05:05:09.253
I know for a fact that these agencies, a lot of them work with students and they have interns like California for Justice has a huge student voice component and really making sure students are a part of this design process because they will be interacting with the

05:05:09.933 --> 05:05:17.959
the people who want to do community engagement and they do show a different perspective on how everyday schools look like, especially since California is so diverse.

05:05:18.279 --> 05:05:23.684
We want to make sure students be like, hey, this is why students have these test scores because I'm in this classroom.

05:05:23.964 --> 05:05:26.986
And so really making sure that students are represented in this process.

05:05:27.206 --> 05:05:27.727
Thank you for that.

05:05:31.810 --> 05:05:38.155
My response is that you've got these six key questions are good ones and you're at a very early stage.

05:05:39.093 --> 05:05:43.857
But there's very little that I've heard on question three.

05:05:43.957 --> 05:05:52.845
What do research and past experience indicate will be the most effective forms of assistance and support to improve student learning and outcomes?

05:05:53.806 --> 05:06:05.397
And then the question and the substantive question is what approaches to assistance and support will advance the goal of building local capacity?

05:06:06.371 --> 05:06:12.215
So there's a lot of, yearly, it's a lot of organization, coordination, communication, engagement.

05:06:12.755 --> 05:06:18.058
But at some point, we're going to have to get down to the, as I said, where's the beef in the hamburger here?

05:06:18.638 --> 05:06:22.581
And I think that's where we're, you know, going to have to get.

05:06:22.861 --> 05:06:29.405
And so I look forward to hearing more about that and less about the top and the bottom of the hamburger.

05:06:29.725 --> 05:06:30.045
Thank you.

05:06:30.686 --> 05:06:30.986
Got it.

05:06:35.249 --> 05:06:35.569
Thank you.

05:06:36.704 --> 05:06:38.305
That's it.

05:06:38.325 --> 05:06:40.247
Okay, we can move on now.

05:06:41.187 --> 05:06:41.808
Item three.

05:06:42.148 --> 05:06:43.309
Item three, yeah.

05:06:43.849 --> 05:06:45.110
You need to call for public comment.

05:06:45.390 --> 05:06:46.171
Public comment.

05:06:46.211 --> 05:06:46.691
I'm sorry.

05:06:46.731 --> 05:06:46.931
Yeah.

05:06:48.012 --> 05:06:51.034
Would Brian Rivas and Leangela Reed please line up?

05:07:00.741 --> 05:07:01.362
Good afternoon.

05:07:01.522 --> 05:07:02.703
I'm from Recovery Children Now.

05:07:02.723 --> 05:07:05.225
I just want to say thank you very much for the update from

05:07:06.055 --> 05:07:13.602
The planning group and the budget act, those things along with Tom being appointed as CCE, I think the table is set for all this work to move forward.

05:07:13.622 --> 05:07:16.925
It's going to be pretty strong for our state.

05:07:16.945 --> 05:07:18.687
A couple of quick things to really hone in on.

05:07:19.327 --> 05:07:26.034
The idea of level one supports, as Jason stated, it'll be a focus for the October meeting, which is great to hear that there has to be a big priority for us.

05:07:27.395 --> 05:07:41.583
One thing on the lead counties is to really identify the idea of current expertise and current capacity for the lead counties to be the best of the best to help everyone else and ensuring that happens and not the political fight that will happen sometimes when people get elbowed out when they really shouldn't be.

05:07:42.183 --> 05:07:47.765
And then beyond that, the braiding of the funds is really promising and we hope to see that continue on.

05:07:48.425 --> 05:07:56.028
In reference to the August memo on the schools, we really feel that the LEA should always be the fulcrum of improvement and continue that structure.

05:07:56.448 --> 05:08:04.671
And that given the confusion around CSI, TSI, and ATS schools, that the funding should be focused on the CSI schools because that would make the most sense to most folks in the field.

05:08:04.832 --> 05:08:05.692
So, thank you.

05:08:14.630 --> 05:08:18.093
Good afternoon, LeAngela Reed on behalf of the Small School Districts Association.

05:08:18.974 --> 05:08:19.814
Just a couple of points.

05:08:20.575 --> 05:08:29.602
One, I really want to thank WestEd and the department, state board staff for tremendous work on the state system support.

05:08:31.302 --> 05:08:34.664
SSDA was fortunate enough to participate in the planning session, planning group.

05:08:35.064 --> 05:08:38.265
It was a really exciting meeting, really thoughtful to hear all the voices.

05:08:38.585 --> 05:08:46.869
And I think it's overall going to be extremely helpful to LEAs whether they need, regardless of what level of support that they need to be part of this system.

05:08:47.369 --> 05:08:50.570
I want to thank you all for such a thoughtful process.

05:08:51.010 --> 05:09:03.272
And I also appreciate the work of the governor and state board staff relative to building in the budget, the fiscal and policy supports for the state system support.

05:09:03.292 --> 05:09:04.632
They're so, they were so needed.

05:09:04.672 --> 05:09:13.874
And I think it will help us to create a tighter safety, the tight safety net that we need while still maintaining the county offices, the hub, which is so important for small school districts.

05:09:14.034 --> 05:09:14.294
Thank you.

05:09:20.428 --> 05:09:25.493
Good afternoon, John Affel from Public Advocates and for the Equity Coalition.

05:09:27.395 --> 05:09:35.303
We also want to appreciate the administration's support for the budget actions expanding out the

05:09:35.823 --> 05:09:50.254
system of support in particular, the community engagement initiative, which we are very excited to be supporting, and the extra $15 million for school climate multi-tiered system of support work.

05:09:53.776 --> 05:10:04.463
We think there's room for continuous improvement in particular when I call out the involvement of community voice in the differentiated assistance process.

05:10:04.503 --> 05:10:15.230
We think there was some effort made toward that in year one, but there needs to be a lot better involvement in going forward.

05:10:15.830 --> 05:10:18.192
And this should not just be a conversation between

05:10:19.012 --> 05:10:29.855
county staff and district staff, but on the differentiated citizens, we ought to be bringing in more time voice and appreciate member Cardenas calling that out as well.

05:10:30.076 --> 05:10:30.376
Thank you.

05:10:36.517 --> 05:10:41.079
President Kirst, I'm Brian Rivas speaking on behalf of the Education Trust West.

05:10:41.983 --> 05:10:51.373
We are participating as a member of the planning group for the system of support, and I wanted to share with you, we think it's going really well.

05:10:51.974 --> 05:11:03.306
We appreciate the way that your staff and I guess WestEd is organizing the work, facilitating the conversation, and I think it's coming along nicely, so thank you for that.

05:11:04.086 --> 05:11:12.294
I do want to ask that you be sure to include ample time and an opportunity for stakeholder engagement.

05:11:12.754 --> 05:11:14.436
We think that's very important.

05:11:15.377 --> 05:11:19.421
And I'll share, when I speak to community groups and people in the field sometimes,

05:11:20.141 --> 05:11:26.368
I hear really this is the most important thing that we're doing as part of the accountability system.

05:11:26.828 --> 05:11:32.134
Communities feel like frequently they could tell you in advance which districts and schools need the help.

05:11:32.595 --> 05:11:34.597
The question is what are we going to do about it?

05:11:34.777 --> 05:11:39.322
So I'm pleased to participate in this effort and thank you.

05:11:43.988 --> 05:11:47.709
Good afternoon, Martha Avalos-Axa, the Association of California School Administrators.

05:11:48.189 --> 05:11:55.992
Similar to the prior speaker and Leangela Reed from the SSDA, AXA is also a member of the planning group, System of Support Planning Group.

05:11:56.292 --> 05:12:01.574
We're very appreciative of the work that the staff has done to have robust conversations about where the system of support is going.

05:12:02.094 --> 05:12:09.117
Really, it's been a great collaboration and discussions among the different stakeholders, and we appreciate being able to be part of those discussions.

05:12:10.077 --> 05:12:22.003
As we discussed in the agenda item number one, the dashboard is continuing to evolve, the system of support is continuing to be evolving, and we're encouraged by the new funding resource available to county offices to build their capacity.

05:12:22.803 --> 05:12:26.765
ACSA does believe that we need to continue to increase communication to the field,

05:12:27.345 --> 05:12:41.715
We appreciate the memo on ESSA implementation and how this will also impact the Title I schools identified for support under ESSA and so we appreciate that there will be a stakeholder meeting on October 5th to try to provide more information to the districts on this issue.

05:12:42.015 --> 05:12:42.395
Thank you.

05:12:42.415 --> 05:12:49.600
Okay that completes the public comments so we're now ready for item 3.

05:12:54.130 --> 05:12:55.691
Carrick Ashley, Deputy Superintendent.

05:12:55.711 --> 05:13:01.714
I'm really here only to introduce Michelle Center, who will be presenting this item to you.

05:13:02.115 --> 05:13:09.939
I just wanted to say that I know many of you realize that I've been sitting on the Executive Committee for Smarter Balance Assessment Consortium.

05:13:11.340 --> 05:13:14.162
My term is ending, but ended.

05:13:15.563 --> 05:13:26.090
But I'm pleased to say that just recently, Michelle Senner has been elected by her peers of the other states in the consortium to serve as chair elect.

05:13:26.611 --> 05:13:39.339
So along with everything else she's doing, this next year, she'll be sitting on the executive committee as chair elect, getting prepared to beat the chair the following year.

05:13:39.359 --> 05:13:40.320
So Michelle Senner.

05:13:41.946 --> 05:13:44.088
Wow, I don't normally get an introduction.

05:13:44.108 --> 05:13:45.329
I feel so special.

05:13:46.150 --> 05:13:49.973
He forgot to mention I ran unopposed, but we'll make it sound really impressive.

05:13:52.893 --> 05:13:54.335
So, good afternoon.

05:13:54.355 --> 05:13:57.999
The item that I will be presenting for you today is for information only.

05:13:58.319 --> 05:14:00.261
It's our CASP update item.

05:14:01.222 --> 05:14:05.847
As you know, as you've all read the item, it includes, you know, various pieces of information.

05:14:05.907 --> 05:14:13.975
But like I normally do when the item is for information only, I will be presenting just a portion of the information that's within the item.

05:14:15.123 --> 05:14:24.756
I do want to make sure to highlight to you all that the CASP summative assessments closed on July 16.

05:14:26.318 --> 05:14:29.162
And just to recap what's in there, because when I do that it sounds

05:14:30.043 --> 05:14:33.207
impressive, more impressive than winning an election unimposed, frankly.

05:14:33.648 --> 05:14:46.245
But it included operational assessments for English language arts and mathematics, a field test for science, a pilot test for the alternate assessment for science, and a pilot test for the California Spanish assessment.

05:14:46.866 --> 05:14:48.647
So we did all that last year.

05:14:49.007 --> 05:14:51.769
So I think that's pretty impressive.

05:14:52.269 --> 05:15:00.394
I also want to let you know that we continue to remind all of our districts to use the data that they have.

05:15:00.874 --> 05:15:03.536
And they have the data from the operational assessments.

05:15:03.956 --> 05:15:04.937
We've sent them a letter.

05:15:05.197 --> 05:15:07.338
We include it in every presentation we do.

05:15:07.818 --> 05:15:11.721
So please know that it is a message that we continue to convey.

05:15:13.402 --> 05:15:29.034
It is not always heard and I think it's just going to take some time, but just know that we have heard you and we know that you want your districts and schools to use the data and that you can count on us to continue to go ahead and convey that.

05:15:30.399 --> 05:15:40.151
So I'm saving the majority of my time here, and I promise to be less time than Cindy, the majority of my time to talk about the electronic score reporting pilot.

05:15:40.652 --> 05:15:44.176
And so I'm going to invite representatives up here with me.

05:15:44.657 --> 05:15:45.858
It'll be Tom Foster.

05:15:45.958 --> 05:15:49.242
He's the executive director of the CASP program at ETS.

05:15:50.003 --> 05:15:56.946
Camden Iliff, Vice President of Product Development for ARIES Student Information Services or Systems, sorry.

05:15:57.766 --> 05:16:03.228
And Sergio Mendoza, Director of Curriculum and Educational Technology for Porterville Unified.

05:16:03.668 --> 05:16:10.091
So those individuals are going to help me present to you information on our electronic student score report pilot.

05:16:10.871 --> 05:16:13.792
So I'm really excited to be talking about this pilot.

05:16:14.113 --> 05:16:15.513
We started it last fall.

05:16:15.553 --> 05:16:17.294
The pilot goes until later this fall.

05:16:18.516 --> 05:16:29.099
And what we're really talking about is a transition, a transition away from paper copies of our student score report to instead sending the same student score report to parents electronically.

05:16:30.159 --> 05:16:38.901
And I want to spend just a few moments before those individuals come up and share the spotlight with me about the many benefits of student score reports.

05:16:39.061 --> 05:16:44.563
And I'm sure that Sergio will also share with you his thoughts on the benefits that occurred in his local district.

05:16:45.751 --> 05:16:48.312
First off, electronic reporting is convenient.

05:16:49.212 --> 05:16:59.515
Families are now going to be able to get their information from a secure access point that is provided to them by their local school district.

05:17:00.135 --> 05:17:08.037
They can get that data via their smartphone, via their tablet, whatever parent portal application that school district uses.

05:17:08.957 --> 05:17:22.607
So I do want to clarify, because there's sometimes a misconception on this, that we are not sending a state-developed or a state-sponsored parent portal for individuals and all parents in the state of California to access.

05:17:23.388 --> 05:17:32.754
Instead, what we want to do is encourage our school districts, many of which already have parent portals, to use them and to now use them for this additional purpose.

05:17:33.875 --> 05:17:38.298
So, electronic reporting is prompt, more prompt than what we have now even.

05:17:38.839 --> 05:17:45.784
So, we no longer have to rely on printing and shipping and a one-time mailing process in order to get these reports to our districts.

05:17:46.685 --> 05:17:48.226
It's efficient.

05:17:48.326 --> 05:17:58.854
District's costs associated with shipping such as postage and staff time to package and mail those reports can now be greatly reduced or in some cases eliminated.

05:17:59.654 --> 05:18:08.675
It will allow our districts to redirect those resources instead to implementing parent portals as a year-round resource for parents.

05:18:10.458 --> 05:18:13.319
We are not mandating that our districts use parent portals.

05:18:14.159 --> 05:18:20.702
So school districts may continue to communicate with their parents as they think is most appropriate.

05:18:21.022 --> 05:18:26.384
If they think it's most appropriate to send parent reports, they can choose to do so.

05:18:26.544 --> 05:18:35.588
Or if they think it's appropriate to send parent reports to some parents because that is how that family likes to receive the information, they can choose to do that too.

05:18:36.068 --> 05:18:39.009
So this really provides lots of options for our districts.

05:18:40.498 --> 05:18:44.343
It is engaging and potentially even more engaging in the future.

05:18:44.803 --> 05:18:53.574
It really promotes the increased use of our district's parent portal as a one-stop shop for families in order for them to access their child's school information.

05:18:54.194 --> 05:19:00.382
So while we are promoting its use for test results, as you can imagine, and I know some of you out there have

05:19:01.523 --> 05:19:14.191
students, and I don't have my cell phone with me, it's in my seat, but normally at this time I pull up my child's results in the parent portal and I show it to all the individuals who maybe are not as familiar with what it looks like.

05:19:14.251 --> 05:19:19.375
It's good, it's the beginning of the school year, so all of her results look really good right now, so it's a good time to pull it up.

05:19:20.895 --> 05:19:30.058
So normally I show that because as some of us may not have children in K-12 right now or may not be involved at a school site, you may be unfamiliar with them.

05:19:30.498 --> 05:19:47.464
But as someone who has a child, one child actually went away to college a few weeks ago, but my youngest is still in our K-12 system and I am so familiar with using that system as a way of knowing what's going on with her in school.

05:19:48.300 --> 05:19:52.204
And I often refer to this as meeting our audience where they are.

05:19:52.905 --> 05:19:54.046
So that's where our parents are now.

05:19:54.607 --> 05:19:55.307
They're on their phones.

05:19:55.788 --> 05:20:01.353
And so this allows our school districts to meet them where they are instead of trying to get them where we want them to be.

05:20:02.640 --> 05:20:04.580
So it's accessible.

05:20:05.361 --> 05:20:10.241
So the cost savings from us having to print these are going back into now translating.

05:20:10.782 --> 05:20:18.023
So we will have our parent reports in English, Spanish, Mandarin, Vietnamese, and Filipino.

05:20:18.983 --> 05:20:21.023
And we will be adding additional languages.

05:20:21.423 --> 05:20:22.164
That's good, right?

05:20:22.244 --> 05:20:23.644
So everyone should be happy.

05:20:24.324 --> 05:20:27.965
I should get a few shout outs from the crowd behind me at that one.

05:20:29.890 --> 05:20:32.212
Yeah, so I think it's pretty impressive.

05:20:32.553 --> 05:20:39.400
So also, now that they are electronic, they can be used with text-to-speech readers.

05:20:39.520 --> 05:20:48.269
So imagine our parents who may be visually impaired now being able to access that information by using an application to do so.

05:20:49.706 --> 05:20:50.747
It's also contemporary.

05:20:51.388 --> 05:20:59.155
Electronic score reports provide a future opportunity to deliver reports that are even more dynamic than the information we have now.

05:20:59.676 --> 05:21:07.843
So we're looking at ways of even modifying them in the future to increase their engagement factor, if you will.

05:21:09.325 --> 05:21:14.650
So now I'd like to call up the individuals that will be co-presenting with me and start off, I believe, with Tom Foster.

05:21:23.137 --> 05:21:23.797
Thanks, Michelle.

05:21:24.178 --> 05:21:25.819
My name is Tom Foster with ETS.

05:21:25.839 --> 05:21:27.720
I'm the executive director in California.

05:21:28.240 --> 05:21:33.423
And for me, just a few details and background about the pilot.

05:21:34.143 --> 05:21:38.225
The pilot had several goals that we set out to

05:21:40.166 --> 05:21:41.727
to utilize with this pilot.

05:21:42.088 --> 05:21:59.017
But one of the main ones was to collaborate with the LEAs and their student information service providers so we could better identify concerns that they might have, potential barriers that are out there that we might not be aware of.

05:21:59.597 --> 05:22:07.782
And this in turn would help us to do better transition planning so that we can get the resources in place, the information in place.

05:22:08.422 --> 05:22:12.203
that will help LEAs to make a good transition.

05:22:12.943 --> 05:22:28.167
In addition, we wanted to make sure that we had the right kinds of communications that were available to help LEAs not only understand the process but understand which for them was the best option in for the local conditions.

05:22:28.787 --> 05:22:31.148
So what we did, we

05:22:34.002 --> 05:22:49.651
We started last spring with technical requirements, working with the student information service providers, SIS vendors, and coming up with those requirements so they all can use them together.

05:22:49.731 --> 05:23:00.238
So we have one standard that everybody can hook into, not only the commercial providers, but also we have a number of homegrown systems that also access this.

05:23:01.238 --> 05:23:12.241
Then in the fall, we selected participants, LEAs, and a couple of service providers to engage in the process.

05:23:12.261 --> 05:23:21.023
What we tried to do was get large and small, get LEAs that were technically very savvy and ones that

05:23:22.421 --> 05:23:28.765
were more challenged in that area, had staff that, or not as much staff perhaps.

05:23:29.305 --> 05:23:31.686
And there's also a different level of readiness.

05:23:32.587 --> 05:23:39.411
Some LEAs are out there using their parent portals and are just right on with it, as Michelle was indicating.

05:23:40.151 --> 05:23:42.853
Others are kind of feeling this out.

05:23:43.813 --> 05:23:58.284
So we did that, we selected those 11 that you see on the screen and then in early 2018, we attested the process with the providers and these people and had a successful testing process.

05:23:58.324 --> 05:24:05.270
Then in May, we released live reports to these LEAs so they could start using them.

05:24:05.590 --> 05:24:07.191
And what I want to do is I want to turn it over to

05:24:08.972 --> 05:24:21.938
Camden from ARIES to do a little bit of a more detailed presentation on how this kind of works with people and then we'll turn it over to our representative from Portugal.

05:24:26.940 --> 05:24:27.461
Good afternoon.

05:24:28.081 --> 05:24:29.642
Cam Iliff from ARIES Software.

05:24:30.962 --> 05:24:36.510
So we've been, we were one of the vendors, of course, that were chosen to be part of the pilot.

05:24:37.211 --> 05:24:40.876
And that really comes from our commitment to California.

05:24:41.396 --> 05:24:45.462
About half of the schools in the state use ARIES for their student information system.

05:24:46.323 --> 05:24:48.405
So we deal with a lot of different types of districts.

05:24:48.885 --> 05:24:59.814
So in the needs to find districts both large and small, rural and urban, as well as affluent and low-income districts, our customer base has all of those.

05:24:59.954 --> 05:25:07.220
And we've been engaging with those districts for a long time to provide solutions that meet the needs of all different types of districts.

05:25:08.632 --> 05:25:23.059
Now, the project goal of leveraging existing parent portals instead of the state, of course, or ETS having to build a new statewide parent portal system, which wouldn't really have been effective.

05:25:24.079 --> 05:25:30.862
So we've been providing a student information system-based parent portal to our customers since about 1999.

05:25:30.982 --> 05:25:32.942
And it's free.

05:25:33.763 --> 05:25:37.924
And all the other vendors in the market, the other SIS vendors, they're just like us.

05:25:38.965 --> 05:25:40.445
They provide free parent portals.

05:25:41.186 --> 05:25:44.867
And we struggle trying to get customers to use them.

05:25:45.687 --> 05:25:49.349
There's like little elementary districts that don't use parent portals at all.

05:25:50.269 --> 05:25:56.998
some even larger unified school districts that also don't actively engage with a parent portal.

05:25:57.699 --> 05:26:05.529
But for the most part, in our analysis, we found the vast majority of our customers do use a parent portal, do use it very effectively.

05:26:06.150 --> 05:26:07.712
We have some very nice statistics on that.

05:26:09.488 --> 05:26:20.131
And the parent portals have been providing some great information to parents for a long time, everything from attendance, day-to-day academic information from the grade book, report cards even.

05:26:20.691 --> 05:26:29.713
We have some customers who have already gone full digital with no paper, all report cards online, all communications in some form of digital communication.

05:26:30.813 --> 05:26:35.975
Recently, these parent portals have become the center point for communications as well.

05:26:37.813 --> 05:26:44.280
So with integrated email, integrated messaging, also through apps that are tied into our system.

05:26:45.582 --> 05:26:48.405
Now, today's parents, they have grown up in the digital age.

05:26:48.705 --> 05:26:54.532
So it's kind of expected that the parents want access to information right now.

05:26:54.632 --> 05:26:55.613
They want it immediate.

05:26:55.633 --> 05:26:56.634
They want it up to date.

05:26:57.034 --> 05:26:58.095
They don't want to have to wait.

05:27:00.239 --> 05:27:08.403
So as we see here in the slide, the CASP paperless scores are presented alongside all of these other areas of the system.

05:27:08.963 --> 05:27:15.747
So you have your attendance, you have your grades, your notifications from the school, and you have your CASP electronic score reports.

05:27:17.087 --> 05:27:21.371
As was mentioned before, the reports are available in multiple languages.

05:27:21.391 --> 05:27:26.575
So we present those languages here, English and Spanish, as examples.

05:27:26.675 --> 05:27:32.120
But as the other language reports come online, those will automatically display as available to parents.

05:27:32.560 --> 05:27:39.526
And in fact, the entire parent portal in ARIES, and most of our competitors as well, are fully translated into a number of different languages.

05:27:40.086 --> 05:27:43.088
The parent or student just chooses that language when they log in.

05:27:43.889 --> 05:27:45.991
So they would see the whole environment just change over.

05:27:48.328 --> 05:27:54.036
Now, in addition, what I was mentioning before, trying to engage parents into the parent portal is very important.

05:27:54.216 --> 05:28:01.267
It's one of the big challenges, especially at the elementary level, where teachers are less inclined to be using a grade book on a day-to-day basis.

05:28:02.048 --> 05:28:03.150
So with elementary parents,

05:28:04.332 --> 05:28:16.503
We want to provide as much content in these parent portals as possible so that the communications can work outbound from the school to the parents, so the parents have a channel to communicate back to teachers in the school.

05:28:17.243 --> 05:28:24.790
So the CASP electronic score reports are just one more piece to try to get those parents more actively involved.

05:28:25.210 --> 05:28:29.074
And of course, parent engagement is a very important part of our LCAP goals.

05:28:33.097 --> 05:28:35.739
Notice also with the way that we've presented.

05:28:35.779 --> 05:28:40.141
Now, this is an example of the way that ARIES is presenting to parents and students.

05:28:40.561 --> 05:28:50.426
This is not necessarily how other vendors are going to do it, but we have served as a leadership role with other vendors and given them guidance about how

05:28:51.786 --> 05:28:56.629
things that they need to know about, things they need to learn, and how to present this information.

05:28:56.749 --> 05:29:03.554
So we have this information, not just by language, but multiple years worth of data will start to accumulate for students.

05:29:04.254 --> 05:29:06.576
And as students move from district to district,

05:29:07.543 --> 05:29:12.024
you'll actually see all the information from tests administered in the previous district.

05:29:12.625 --> 05:29:15.406
And that we saw was one of the greatest benefits.

05:29:15.846 --> 05:29:18.247
A lot of these reports just go off into the ether, right?

05:29:18.287 --> 05:29:22.328
The paper goes home and the paper gets thrown away or it gets lost.

05:29:22.768 --> 05:29:27.472
Like, I can't find my kids' reports from last year, and most parents are probably the same.

05:29:27.892 --> 05:29:33.818
But if we want to track the student's progress over time, and as a parent, an engaged parent, I want to see that progress.

05:29:34.238 --> 05:29:43.186
So I can go into the Parent Portal, whether it's ARIES or one of the other systems, no matter what district, and I can see all of these score reports of full history.

05:29:43.806 --> 05:29:46.628
Now, hopefully, CASP isn't just the end.

05:29:47.088 --> 05:29:53.293
Hopefully, we see other state reports also included as this type of delivery system.

05:29:54.814 --> 05:29:57.056
Now, and there's one last element.

05:29:58.097 --> 05:29:59.878
We decided to kind of take it to the next level.

05:30:00.619 --> 05:30:09.826
As we saw this delivery of information so critical to parents being through the Parent Portal, we also want to provide this information to counselors, teachers, and other office staff.

05:30:10.566 --> 05:30:17.271
So because Ares is a unified platform, we were able to take this same interface and just apply it to other types of users.

05:30:17.751 --> 05:30:19.932
Now, of course, it's secured independently.

05:30:20.393 --> 05:30:22.034
So teachers have access to it.

05:30:22.394 --> 05:30:23.555
Counselors can have access to it.

05:30:23.575 --> 05:30:26.157
But maybe the nurse or a secretary will not.

05:30:26.917 --> 05:30:36.945
So that's going to give parents, not just parents, but teachers the ability to view more detailed information about their students as they move around from district to district.

05:30:37.286 --> 05:30:46.413
So you have your high mobility students, like foster and homeless, that when they come into a new school, the teacher really knows nothing about what's going on with that student's academic progress.

05:30:46.954 --> 05:30:50.036
So they're able to see a full history of the student's

05:30:50.757 --> 05:30:57.873
state tests and hopefully be able to adjust and create some more into better individualized learning programs for that student.

05:30:59.457 --> 05:31:03.161
So hopefully that will make an impact.

05:31:03.782 --> 05:31:05.223
And lastly, the other thing was the app.

05:31:05.804 --> 05:31:15.454
We are including access to these reports, which are delivered via PDF, but they will be embedded inside our app that we provide for parents as well.

05:31:15.974 --> 05:31:20.399
Because we're seeing that the majority of parents are using our app and not the website.

05:31:21.408 --> 05:31:27.491
So it's been a huge migration over the last 12 months for our parents after we rolled it out last year.

05:31:28.091 --> 05:31:29.832
So it has to be there.

05:31:30.112 --> 05:31:33.954
And so for the full-fledged implementation later on this year, it will be available.

05:31:34.774 --> 05:31:37.215
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Sergio.

05:31:38.016 --> 05:31:38.256
Thank you.

05:31:42.668 --> 05:31:43.509
Good afternoon again.

05:31:43.689 --> 05:31:47.271
I am representing Porterville Unified School District in Tulare County.

05:31:47.891 --> 05:31:54.114
And we did it for two reasons why we got into the paperless pilot this year.

05:31:54.294 --> 05:32:10.904
One of them is all of the things that Camden just said is a lot of our parents, our newer parents are online, are using their cell phones, are using emails, and it's a quicker access to the process.

05:32:11.684 --> 05:32:21.129
Plus, also, we saw ourselves as one of those districts, as Michael stated, that wasn't pushing it, weren't pushing it, weren't getting that response back.

05:32:21.229 --> 05:32:27.032
In fact, we were under 20% of parents with accounts for a parent portal

05:32:27.512 --> 05:32:33.276
And now we've gone up to 32% since we started in July with this paperless product.

05:32:33.316 --> 05:32:37.478
And we're not finished yet because we're in the middle of back to school nights.

05:32:37.578 --> 05:32:42.061
And we're promoting it very hard in these next couple of weeks also.

05:32:42.121 --> 05:32:50.946
And we continue to see that there's some schools primarily that are in need of some extra support that just their office staff cannot do.

05:32:51.066 --> 05:32:53.888
But we plan to do that at the district level.

05:32:54.628 --> 05:32:59.289
That was one of the two main reasons that we were involved in it.

05:32:59.629 --> 05:33:13.233
And the other thing was really to engage our students and parents in that communication piece about their school and the essential piece of knowing what's happening at school and how are we doing as students.

05:33:13.653 --> 05:33:17.334
So one of the things we did is quickly changed our website.

05:33:18.294 --> 05:33:21.716
and made sure that it said Ares portal.

05:33:21.876 --> 05:33:26.478
We used to call it MyPUSD, but we changed it and put the Ares portal.

05:33:26.799 --> 05:33:28.600
And one of the things is how we did that.

05:33:29.742 --> 05:33:34.446
As you see here is the parent would see this on their screens.

05:33:34.886 --> 05:33:41.231
And then up there on the very top under the district, the name district, is this English.

05:33:41.271 --> 05:33:42.352
And there's a toggle there.

05:33:42.532 --> 05:33:44.633
And you quickly change it to Spanish.

05:33:44.914 --> 05:33:47.155
And then it'll change to Spanish for our parents.

05:33:47.195 --> 05:33:56.983
So one of the things we do is as a parent came into our district office and they wanted to be a part of this, we went through the whole process with them on their phones.

05:33:57.583 --> 05:34:02.648
got them an email if they needed an email, and we made it accessible to them immediately.

05:34:03.088 --> 05:34:06.871
For those parents that still don't have that, that's what the schools are doing now.

05:34:07.292 --> 05:34:13.077
And just to let you know, we did receive this year all of this test scores on paper also.

05:34:14.238 --> 05:34:23.624
But we also kept those until school started, because we wanted to see how many parents came in, how many parents were using their portal accounts.

05:34:23.965 --> 05:34:25.786
And we saw much success in it.

05:34:26.166 --> 05:34:29.068
And right now, as of right now, we don't have any complaints.

05:34:29.108 --> 05:34:30.189
So that's a good thing, right?

05:34:31.130 --> 05:34:35.092
So we always look at that as the barometer for all of us.

05:34:35.132 --> 05:34:36.793
So that's one of the things that we do.

05:34:37.794 --> 05:34:45.458
So one of the things is we started with our system, which did a text, email, and phone messaging through Blackboard Connect.

05:34:45.798 --> 05:34:51.561
And we made sure that at that time it was done in English and Spanish, because our Spanish is our majority language.

05:34:52.101 --> 05:34:53.882
And so we got that out during the summer.

05:34:54.322 --> 05:34:59.204
And lo and behold, people were receiving the message and calling back and coming in.

05:34:59.304 --> 05:35:03.006
And we had extended hours in our office

05:35:03.426 --> 05:35:07.247
near our enrollment center for people to come and access their accounts.

05:35:07.587 --> 05:35:10.968
And if they really wanted it printed, we even printed it for them.

05:35:11.048 --> 05:35:16.610
But at the same time, we were promoting the fact of let's get it onto the electronic.

05:35:17.050 --> 05:35:18.331
And so we signed up parents.

05:35:18.411 --> 05:35:18.771
And again,

05:35:19.511 --> 05:35:22.872
trying to do that all with bilingual staff.

05:35:23.392 --> 05:35:29.853
And one of the things, as you see here, and went even a little step further, is with the QR code, right?

05:35:29.994 --> 05:35:31.914
You can grab that from pretty much anywhere.

05:35:31.954 --> 05:35:44.337
If you put it on a poster outside of your school, you can grab that with your camera, as long as you have that capability with your phone, iPad, whatever you might be carrying with you.

05:35:46.317 --> 05:35:50.659
And one of the other big things that we're using is, of course, our social media right now.

05:35:50.780 --> 05:35:53.381
Our Twitter account is on my left-hand side.

05:35:53.421 --> 05:35:57.023
That would be, I guess, your left-hand side, too, if you're seeing the screen in front of you.

05:35:57.443 --> 05:35:58.584
And also our Facebook.

05:35:59.284 --> 05:36:05.888
As you can see, probably some people also on attendance, I came and I thought about that after as it went on to there.

05:36:05.948 --> 05:36:12.672
I go, I came at the appropriate time because I came up earlier on the chronic absenteeism, but this is our

05:36:13.286 --> 05:36:21.789
Awareness month and that's one of the things we do promote in our our district also, but the the Twitter account Also made a big impact.

05:36:21.869 --> 05:36:34.374
We use our local newspaper, even though that may be sliding away at least we know parents read that and we do as much as we can on local radio English and Spanish for all of that and

05:36:35.063 --> 05:36:41.346
But the biggest thing I think that we're learning, too, is that now we're having to identify the people that are not doing it.

05:36:42.026 --> 05:36:42.746
And so why?

05:36:43.407 --> 05:36:44.067
What is that?

05:36:44.667 --> 05:36:46.048
Is it work-related?

05:36:46.368 --> 05:36:52.331
We're in a very rural agricultural area, and right now it's hot and heavy with all of the

05:36:53.041 --> 05:36:54.462
of picking the fruit right now.

05:36:54.522 --> 05:36:59.984
And so we know, and that's why we stayed open later, but we know that's a need and a necessity.

05:37:00.504 --> 05:37:06.066
And we'll continue to do that and outreach because we know they do have cell phones because we get calls back.

05:37:06.606 --> 05:37:07.627
I missed a phone call.

05:37:08.247 --> 05:37:09.328
who called me, right?

05:37:09.388 --> 05:37:13.793
And so sometimes they call us at the district office and maybe not the school site.

05:37:14.213 --> 05:37:20.659
So we know the communication piece is there, and we just have to work on our part to get out to it.

05:37:21.099 --> 05:37:25.343
But we did not neglect the fact that if parents don't want

05:37:26.221 --> 05:37:26.461
Right?

05:37:26.501 --> 05:37:30.603
The electronic will have the paper always, always available.

05:37:30.683 --> 05:37:33.004
But we found much success.

05:37:33.324 --> 05:37:41.588
We had a few little glitches, but ARIES and CALPADS and ETS and everybody that combines our efforts for all our scores.

05:37:42.549 --> 05:37:44.771
help create and resolve those issues.

05:37:45.111 --> 05:37:56.520
At the beginning, we were having a couple of students, and we ended up finding out everybody that had an issue actually was a good thing, I guess, in a way, because they had perfect scores on either ELA or math or combination.

05:37:56.940 --> 05:37:59.002
So somebody

05:37:59.722 --> 05:38:02.863
over here was holding on to those test scores a little bit.

05:38:02.903 --> 05:38:03.943
So that's OK.

05:38:04.504 --> 05:38:07.805
But the reality is those students did receive those perfect scores.

05:38:07.825 --> 05:38:10.166
So that was the only glitch that we saw.

05:38:10.226 --> 05:38:13.327
So other than that, it went well for us.

05:38:15.847 --> 05:38:19.589
So shall we go back?

05:38:22.626 --> 05:38:34.194
So I'd like to thank ARIES as well as Porterville, but also thank all the other entities that you see on the slide here that participated in the pilot.

05:38:34.434 --> 05:38:44.901
And as you can see, ARIES was not the only vendor that participated, but we thought one was enough in terms of the presentation before you today.

05:38:45.641 --> 05:38:50.184
So I'm available to answer any questions.

05:38:51.546 --> 05:38:52.490
Board member questions?

05:38:53.033 --> 05:38:53.897
Board member Williams.

05:38:57.443 --> 05:38:58.764
I'm just curious about something.

05:38:58.784 --> 05:39:08.789
I have a little experience with this because I serve as an advocate for a couple of Latino low-income boys in San Diego and have for several years.

05:39:10.170 --> 05:39:21.637
And as it turns out, one of the things that I didn't know was going to be my role turned out to be a need, which is the parents are divorced.

05:39:22.177 --> 05:39:24.338
The mother doesn't use email.

05:39:25.959 --> 05:39:28.180
The dad doesn't read email.

05:39:28.780 --> 05:39:30.221
He only reads text.

05:39:32.042 --> 05:39:37.224
He works as a contractor and is fluent on text and phone, but neither of them email.

05:39:38.045 --> 05:39:42.387
And so one of the things I wind up doing is I'm on power school.

05:39:43.707 --> 05:39:46.029
you know, as one of the recipients of the grades.

05:39:46.589 --> 05:39:52.653
And so I get the grades and then send the grades to the sons and also to the dad.

05:39:53.714 --> 05:39:56.515
And sometimes I have to interpret them, you know, what they mean.

05:39:56.535 --> 05:40:01.819
And I'm just one, you know, this can't be the only case like this.

05:40:02.419 --> 05:40:10.967
that I just wound up with this family that I'm supporting that does not benefit or won't access the power school.

05:40:11.387 --> 05:40:16.312
And so I was glad to hear you say that you still make paper available for some people.

05:40:16.672 --> 05:40:19.214
This particular school that they go to doesn't.

05:40:20.536 --> 05:40:30.904
And so, you know, I've kind of, I don't, I mean, it's not a big deal for me, but I didn't know that was going to be part of what I was going to be doing, that they were not able to access that.

05:40:30.944 --> 05:40:43.554
So I'm just curious how common that is if you're working in, you know, low-income families with low-income families that may not be fluent in English or fluent in education jargon.

05:40:45.845 --> 05:40:53.628
I do not have statistics on how many parents have delegated the parent portal to another person.

05:40:54.148 --> 05:40:58.829
And if I hadn't taken it, they would have just not known the grades is what that would have worked out.

05:40:58.889 --> 05:41:01.290
It's not like they would have, they didn't delegate that to me.

05:41:01.350 --> 05:41:04.311
I just figured out that it was a problem they were having.

05:41:04.811 --> 05:41:07.412
And once I figured it out, I wasn't going to let it go.

05:41:07.772 --> 05:41:09.913
I wanted to make sure that they had the grades.

05:41:10.839 --> 05:41:14.604
I would say it is true that many things are going paperless.

05:41:15.164 --> 05:41:16.266
And you mentioned grades.

05:41:17.167 --> 05:41:21.432
Registration, for example, is another thing that is going paperless.

05:41:21.612 --> 05:41:24.937
So it is the future.

05:41:26.258 --> 05:41:28.221
You did mention interpretation.

05:41:28.581 --> 05:41:30.983
though, is another thing that you mentioned.

05:41:31.263 --> 05:41:42.911
And as we move forward, another future presentation that I hope to bring forward to you, and I believe Tony Alpert might be behind me somewhere, the executive director of Smarter Balanced.

05:41:42.951 --> 05:41:58.401
So one of the future presentations I'm going to do for you will be on a new resource that we are developing with Smarter Balanced that we would be able to link from our parent report to this new resources to help parents interpret their data.

05:41:59.341 --> 05:42:12.567
And the fact that we have a resource now but we give that to someone on paper and they'd have to go to a computer and they'd have to type in a URL is really causing us probably not to have the hit rate that we would like to have on that.

05:42:13.007 --> 05:42:21.731
So we're really hoping that another benefit of putting our student reports electronic is how easy it's going to be for those parents who want additional information

05:42:22.191 --> 05:42:29.456
to now just be able to click on that and go to a parent resource that helps them understand what the scores mean.

05:42:29.576 --> 05:42:37.562
And so that's another advantage that we'll be showing that as soon as it's developed, probably in the early next year.

05:42:38.003 --> 05:42:38.463
Sounds great.

05:42:39.926 --> 05:42:40.766
I'm sorry.

05:42:41.707 --> 05:42:43.768
I'm confused, I guess.

05:42:44.768 --> 05:42:53.212
If a parent wants to access student results online, can they go to the state website?

05:42:53.953 --> 05:42:54.113
No.

05:42:54.353 --> 05:42:56.814
So it's all being passed down to the local?

05:42:56.834 --> 05:43:02.137
A local district is the entity responsible for ensuring that parents get the reports.

05:43:02.157 --> 05:43:02.717
Okay.

05:43:03.377 --> 05:43:09.501
local school district has options as we move in the future about how they get that information to parents.

05:43:10.822 --> 05:43:15.545
The easiest option in the new schema will be to use a parent portal.

05:43:15.645 --> 05:43:17.166
That will be the easiest option.

05:43:17.727 --> 05:43:26.573
This year we have a limited quantity of paper and we are currently developing the criteria for who would be eligible for that small amount of paper that we have available to us.

05:43:27.093 --> 05:43:29.355
But they also have all of it electronically.

05:43:29.395 --> 05:43:32.997
If they choose to print it out themselves, they can print it out themselves.

05:43:33.457 --> 05:43:37.300
We've also heard from some districts that are implementing these parent hubs.

05:43:37.921 --> 05:43:50.010
So for example, if they don't have Technology at home another thing they're using are these hubs where an individual can help them access Not only this but various things that have gone paperless and districts.

05:43:50.611 --> 05:44:02.280
So that's another option I think la unified is Considering for the future, but no we we are not the entity that's responsible for getting it to parents and that's and that's a shift correct

05:44:02.660 --> 05:44:02.841
No.

05:44:03.361 --> 05:44:07.849
That is currently, right now, it is the district that is responsible for getting the reports to parents.

05:44:10.239 --> 05:44:20.962
I'm thinking of individual schools, like individual charter schools that may not have the wherewithal to have a vendor system, you know, and that sort of thing, but potentially.

05:44:21.362 --> 05:44:27.664
And so how do they find out, how do they get support or help to figure out how to do this?

05:44:28.204 --> 05:44:30.645
I'm sorry, how does who help?

05:44:31.425 --> 05:44:35.626
The gentleman who spoke, you know, how this robust system, but tiny little LEAs.

05:44:40.703 --> 05:44:43.264
a way they can get support just by contacting CDE?

05:44:44.925 --> 05:44:53.008
I almost feel like a fellow board member is dying to answer your question, but... I'll let her, but I just had one other comment.

05:44:53.228 --> 05:44:55.189
Tremendous savings in paper, right?

05:44:55.949 --> 05:44:57.510
Tremendous cost...

05:44:59.964 --> 05:45:15.107
In terms of the state costs, there are savings in paper that has all been reinvested into, one, setting up this process, which has been costly, but then also storage, cloud storage for all of these reports, as well as now translation services.

05:45:15.127 --> 05:45:15.507
Thank you.

05:45:15.527 --> 05:45:27.170
I wanted to give you the opportunity to explain where all the savings was going, because I thought in your presentation you said it went for translation of the... That is one of the... That's one of the things, but that's...

05:45:28.766 --> 05:45:29.869
That wouldn't cost that much.

05:45:30.290 --> 05:45:31.032
Absolutely.

05:45:31.654 --> 05:45:34.963
I assume there's quite a bit more savings and you're using it in these other ways.

05:45:35.003 --> 05:45:35.304
Yes.

05:45:35.424 --> 05:45:35.605
Okay.

05:45:37.418 --> 05:45:37.658
Okay.

05:45:37.678 --> 05:45:39.759
Board member Sun, do you want to respond?

05:45:40.359 --> 05:45:41.020
Not necessarily.

05:45:41.060 --> 05:45:48.203
So in the past, what happens is that the LEAs charter schools would get these huge boxes of reports and you sort them out and you mail them out.

05:45:48.484 --> 05:45:50.445
So the difference is now you get them electronically.

05:45:50.465 --> 05:45:51.545
You can print them out yourself.

05:45:51.565 --> 05:45:57.248
So the cost does shift from the state to the LEA if that's the way that the LEA chooses to do that.

05:45:57.728 --> 05:46:06.313
I love this option and wondering when this might expand at some point to other SIS systems and

05:46:07.213 --> 05:46:08.374
Other SIS systems?

05:46:08.555 --> 05:46:08.715
Yes.

05:46:09.035 --> 05:46:14.741
So you can see the SIS systems on the slide here who participated in the pilot, right?

05:46:14.781 --> 05:46:22.849
So Aries and Infinite Campus, as well as two districts, I believe, on here who have their homegrown system, LA Unified and El Monte.

05:46:23.570 --> 05:46:30.357
And El Monte, both of those have, those two school districts have their own SIS system and then two other vendors.

05:46:30.797 --> 05:46:34.441
But we have not excluded any vendors from these conversations.

05:46:34.941 --> 05:46:40.046
We have included them as part of our normal SIS meetings that we have with the vendors.

05:46:40.086 --> 05:46:42.268
We've included this as part of that.

05:46:42.388 --> 05:46:45.632
So we hope that they are all ready this year.

05:46:46.672 --> 05:46:47.493
All of the major ones.

05:46:47.553 --> 05:46:54.118
And it would be the SIS system company contracting with ETS or through the state?

05:46:54.178 --> 05:46:56.359
They do not need to contract at all.

05:46:57.400 --> 05:47:00.883
Most of these vendors, as Camden presented,

05:47:01.703 --> 05:47:09.409
Parent Portal is kind of free with the purchase of their SIS system, so they just need to implement the Parent Portal part.

05:47:09.949 --> 05:47:18.916
We have a system in place whereby we transfer electronically these reports, and so that's the type of work.

05:47:19.556 --> 05:47:34.286
that we needed to spend some of those cost savings on is developing that system to store and have the language, if you will, to transfer the reports from our storage facility to where they need to access them from.

05:47:34.466 --> 05:47:34.666
Right.

05:47:35.426 --> 05:47:35.726
Thank you.

05:47:37.307 --> 05:47:38.028
Patricia Rucker.

05:47:40.191 --> 05:47:40.652
Hi, Michelle.

05:47:40.712 --> 05:47:42.453
I'm very excited about this project.

05:47:42.854 --> 05:47:52.923
I think my question is related to the work that your department's also doing as it relates to wiring and getting districts across the state connected.

05:47:53.444 --> 05:48:01.412
What is the limitation for districts that are still geographically remote and don't have access because they're not wired yet?

05:48:02.312 --> 05:48:04.474
to be able to take advantage of this?

05:48:04.574 --> 05:48:11.039
Are there still districts out there that are not yet wired and online and able to do this?

05:48:11.319 --> 05:48:15.242
And how is that capacity going to be looked at and developed?

05:48:16.434 --> 05:48:19.156
I'm gonna ask my my pair Jerry to come up.

05:48:19.317 --> 05:48:20.277
I knew who that was.

05:48:20.317 --> 05:48:24.021
That's and I wanted I wanted to hear his voice today That's why I asked that question.

05:48:24.621 --> 05:48:37.693
I've been dying to come up here Jerry Winkler data management There are very very few districts that don't have Extensive broadband as a matter of fact, we've been working with a big grant since 2014-15

05:48:41.195 --> 05:48:50.865
We've worked with even the smallest of districts to get at least some microwave towers up, some wireless.

05:48:51.445 --> 05:48:54.108
Most districts have significant broadband.

05:48:54.528 --> 05:48:57.912
And if they do not, we've been working.

05:48:58.713 --> 05:49:00.614
And I shouldn't say if they don't, because they do have.

05:49:02.776 --> 05:49:03.276
broadband.

05:49:03.316 --> 05:49:06.419
So if there, if you know of some that I'm not aware of.

05:49:06.499 --> 05:49:07.300
I didn't ask the question.

05:49:07.480 --> 05:49:08.301
I'm very interested.

05:49:08.501 --> 05:49:13.064
Yeah, I didn't ask the question because I knew it when I asked the question because I wanted to hear you say that.

05:49:13.425 --> 05:49:18.048
The reason I was asking that question is related to what board member Sun said.

05:49:18.389 --> 05:49:27.156
There is some cost shifting from the department because they no longer have to print the report to the districts on how they make a decision about how the information gets out.

05:49:27.576 --> 05:49:29.318
So for, is there a difference?

05:49:30.740 --> 05:49:43.570
Is there a difference in cost or is there a difference in cost pressures among districts because of the type of broadband they have or the type of services they're actually able to use to do any of this?

05:49:43.931 --> 05:49:44.651
Not that I'm aware of.

05:49:44.831 --> 05:49:45.092
Okay.

05:49:45.552 --> 05:49:45.972
Thank you.

05:49:47.554 --> 05:49:48.374
Any other questions?

05:49:49.115 --> 05:49:49.855
Public comment.

05:49:51.857 --> 05:49:53.458
Would the following speakers please line up?

05:49:53.699 --> 05:49:56.501
Doug McRae, Mary Perry, Martha Saragosa-Diaz.

05:50:05.540 --> 05:50:05.960
Good afternoon.

05:50:06.421 --> 05:50:07.082
Good afternoon again.

05:50:07.122 --> 05:50:09.504
I'm Doug McRae, retired test publisher for Monterey.

05:50:10.285 --> 05:50:24.638
Given the controversy last year over the 2017 consortium-wide gain scores for Smarter Balanced states, a major concern this year should be whether the 2018 scores will provide credible change data for state and local accountability.

05:50:25.739 --> 05:50:33.041
To address this concern I've been collecting 2018 results from all the Smarter Balanced as well as PARC states Right now.

05:50:33.081 --> 05:50:34.721
I've got only seven.

05:50:35.001 --> 05:50:53.226
I've got seven of 16 states With six of those described in your electronic folder the basic results submitted last week it's too early to say whether the change data from 2017 to 2018 for Smarter Balanced states will deviate from the

05:50:54.626 --> 05:50:55.807
2017 gain data.

05:50:56.387 --> 05:51:01.928
I anticipate results for most of the remaining consortium states within the next two weeks.

05:51:02.889 --> 05:51:08.970
And as soon as I have a sufficient number, I'll do a 2018 data document parallel to the one I did last year.

05:51:09.170 --> 05:51:09.510
Tom.

05:51:09.790 --> 05:51:14.012
And I'll then distribute that email to, by email, to interested parties.

05:51:15.052 --> 05:51:15.352
Thank you.

05:51:19.346 --> 05:51:20.046
Good afternoon.

05:51:20.106 --> 05:51:23.088
Martha Zaragoza-Diaz representing Californians Together.

05:51:23.408 --> 05:51:34.194
And I'm here to say that we are very, very pleased to see that there will be, in addition to Spanish, other languages with regards to the electronic student score reports.

05:51:34.835 --> 05:51:42.399
Also, the expanded information contained in these reports for the purpose of parent understanding and family engagement.

05:51:43.460 --> 05:51:47.004
We believe that this will be a very useful tool for our parents.

05:51:47.584 --> 05:51:56.895
Now, our responsibility is to inform our parents in terms of the fact that the parent portal is available and how to access it.

05:51:57.455 --> 05:52:01.380
Additionally, just a reminder that the inclusion of the

05:52:02.060 --> 05:52:13.025
California Spanish assessment in the accountability system is still a priority of ours and we will continue to pursue this and we will have future conversations with State Board and CDE staff.

05:52:13.365 --> 05:52:13.645
Thank you.

05:52:18.766 --> 05:52:22.369
Hello, Mary Perry, representing the California State PTA.

05:52:22.529 --> 05:52:43.166
And first, I really want to thank Michelle and her team and her partners at ETS and at ARIES for the comprehensive work they've done to not only think through the vast differences among districts and their needs, but also what works in terms of family engagement and this kind of information.

05:52:43.946 --> 05:52:54.531
The idea that these reports are going to be accessible and also point people, parents, more effectively to those portals is really important.

05:52:55.111 --> 05:53:01.394
First of all, because it helps parents to understand that they're welcome to have this information.

05:53:01.914 --> 05:53:03.295
Secondly, the communication.

05:53:04.055 --> 05:53:13.261
is broad, is consistent, and I love the fact that there's going to be data collection that gives that two-way information because I think districts really need that.

05:53:13.801 --> 05:53:20.205
And we also know from research that family engagement hinges on parents understanding how their kids are doing in school.

05:53:20.925 --> 05:53:23.126
So this is a triple play.

05:53:23.647 --> 05:53:23.947
Thank you.

05:53:28.544 --> 05:53:30.865
Good afternoon, Jan Correa from CAVE.

05:53:31.125 --> 05:53:34.866
And again, I just want to add my word of thanks and appreciation for this emphasis.

05:53:35.547 --> 05:53:43.450
CAVE has a strong emphasis on engaging our parents in being involved in their school communities and being leaders in their school communities with a variety of languages.

05:53:44.010 --> 05:53:50.432
We have talked often with the department and our colleagues here at the state level about the need to make information accessible in other languages.

05:53:50.492 --> 05:53:54.114
And so we really commend you for doing so and for the support of the state board in doing so.

05:53:54.854 --> 05:54:03.557
Now we know the next step is really putting it to practice and helping our parent leaders become the advocates for this and putting this into practice with other parents in their communities.

05:54:03.657 --> 05:54:15.900
And CABE, through our Project to Inspire program and other partnerships with the state, will do what we can through trainings, through social media, through other convenings that we hold to make this information available for parents as well.

05:54:16.080 --> 05:54:17.421
So we thank you for the support.

05:54:17.781 --> 05:54:18.381
Muchas gracias.

05:54:20.365 --> 05:54:26.297
Okay, that's the end of this item and so the board will break till three o'clock and then we'll resume with item four.

05:54:53.439 --> 05:55:00.801
Okay, the board will reconvene and we're ready for item four.

05:55:01.862 --> 05:55:06.603
This is a reorganization issue and it'll be a public hearing.

05:55:08.364 --> 05:55:11.925
But first, our CDE presenter, Larry Shirey, will begin.

05:55:13.745 --> 05:55:15.026
Larry, will you come up, please?

05:55:31.360 --> 05:55:31.920
Good afternoon.

05:55:31.940 --> 05:55:32.481
Is it on?

05:55:33.121 --> 05:55:33.922
Yeah, it's on.

05:55:34.322 --> 05:55:37.845
Good afternoon, President Kerr, Superintendent Torlakson, members of the board.

05:55:37.885 --> 05:55:40.006
I'm Larry Shirey, School Fiscal Services Division.

05:55:41.327 --> 05:55:58.000
First thing we have up today, our first item is an appeal from the action of the San Mateo County Committee on School District Organization to disapprove a transfer of territory from the Ravenswood City Elementary School District to the Menlo Park City Elementary School District.

05:56:00.097 --> 05:56:03.780
The County Committee unanimously disapproved the proposal.

05:56:05.401 --> 05:56:19.132
And after I present information regarding the proposal and you've heard the public and affected parties in the public comment period, you'll take action on either to affirm that unanimous decision of the County Committee or reverse it.

05:56:20.545 --> 05:56:24.326
If you reverse the county committee, the transfer proposal will go to an election.

05:56:24.687 --> 05:56:26.847
So you will also need to set an election area.

05:56:27.548 --> 05:56:29.648
We'll go over these options again after later.

05:56:31.049 --> 05:56:43.093
In terms of the procedure for taking action today, the first thing we're going to do is consider the minimum threshold requirements for district reorganizations.

05:56:43.713 --> 05:56:45.294
Once that's over, there are nine of them.

05:56:46.212 --> 05:56:51.336
Just as a background, there are nine of them in Education Code Statute 35753.

05:56:51.396 --> 05:56:54.259
We're only going to go through three of them.

05:56:54.879 --> 05:56:57.902
Those are the three that the County Committee found were not met.

05:56:58.362 --> 05:57:03.746
The other ones will agree, you know, if you have questions about the other six, I'll be happy to answer them.

05:57:03.806 --> 05:57:09.171
But in the interest of time, we'll just address the three that the County Committee found lacking.

05:57:12.513 --> 05:57:27.599
Once you have made a determination about these conditions being met, then the next step is to determine whether there is a local educational need to approve the reorganization, approve the territory expansion.

05:57:27.619 --> 05:57:33.102
In other words, is there a local reason, a compelling local reason to overturn the county committee's decision?

05:57:36.428 --> 05:57:47.600
But before we get started, I want to talk a little bit about, give you a little bit of background about the districts and some of the other issues that I think are important for you to consider.

05:57:48.961 --> 05:57:50.302
First of all, here's a map.

05:57:51.043 --> 05:57:56.549
If you can see that, it's a map of both the Ravenswood District and the Menlo Park District.

05:57:58.085 --> 05:58:09.652
Both of these elementary school districts are components of Sequoia Union High School District and both are in the attendance area of the Menlo-Atherton High School of that high school district.

05:58:10.473 --> 05:58:13.895
The blank area that you see there is the city of Menlo Park.

05:58:15.710 --> 05:58:20.554
The city of Menlo Park, as you see, is in at least three school districts.

05:58:22.415 --> 05:58:24.937
It's about half of the Menlo Park district.

05:58:25.678 --> 05:58:28.960
It's about half of the Ravenswood school district.

05:58:29.360 --> 05:58:38.067
It looks a little bigger for Ravenswood because school district boundaries, as with city boundaries, include bodies of water.

05:58:38.147 --> 05:58:42.590
So a lot of that in the northeast section is the south part of San Francisco Bay.

05:58:43.641 --> 05:58:51.588
There's also a chunk down towards the bottom left-hand corner of the map of the city of Menlo Park in the Las Lomitas School District.

05:58:52.249 --> 05:58:58.855
And I suppose if we want to include bodies of water, there's a corner of the city in Redwood City School District.

05:59:00.000 --> 05:59:04.383
The two districts are fairly different in terms of ethnic composition.

05:59:04.684 --> 05:59:13.070
Ravenswood School District is over 99% minority, while the Menlo Park School District is about 40% minority.

05:59:13.770 --> 05:59:27.701
The city of Menlo Park and the city of East Palo Alto, if you see the words proposed transfer area, the little red area is the transfer area we're going to talk about, but the land underneath the wording is the city of East Palo Alto.

05:59:28.670 --> 05:59:40.635
They're also very different in terms of measures of affluent, you know, in terms of education level of parents and income and those sorts of issues.

05:59:44.377 --> 05:59:55.161
Throughout the course of the past number of decades, there have been a lot of territory transfers out of Ravenswood into the Menlo Park School District.

05:59:56.730 --> 06:00:02.593
The area that we're going to be interested in mostly is the Willows neighborhood of Menlo Park.

06:00:03.573 --> 06:00:17.981
And on the map of the school district, Menlo Park School District, the Willows area is basically the far eastern corner of the Menlo Park School District.

06:00:19.421 --> 06:00:22.803
Most of that, as you see, is in the Menlo

06:00:24.281 --> 06:00:25.322
Park School District.

06:00:25.923 --> 06:00:34.052
That's because the State Board approved transfer of most of that neighborhood out of Ravenswood into Menlo Park in 1983.

06:00:34.192 --> 06:00:42.081
The Ravenswood School District opposed that transfer partly because at the time the Willows area was about

06:00:42.501 --> 06:01:02.687
only about 28% minority, while they at that time were 98% minority and they didn't see the sense in transferring such a large number of non-minority students out of a very minority district into Menlo Park, which was only about 10% minority at that time.

06:01:08.272 --> 06:01:10.174
The Willows transfer occurred.

06:01:10.574 --> 06:01:15.898
We're going to move into some litigation that is relevant to the issue here.

06:01:16.438 --> 06:01:20.781
The Willows transfer occurred in the middle of the decade-long Tinsley litigation.

06:01:21.428 --> 06:01:31.897
brought forward by parents of Ravenswood students because of what they perceived as a racial isolation of their students from students in the other school district.

06:01:32.357 --> 06:01:46.609
One of the allegations in that litigation is that the history of territory transfers out of Ravenswood removed a large number of non-minority students, which in turn increased the racial isolation of the students.

06:01:47.731 --> 06:02:07.098
In 1986, I should note that all the elementary districts in Sequoia were respondents to this litigation as was Palo Alto Unified in Santa Clara County, the county superintendents in both Santa Clara and San Mateo County, the department and the State Board of Education.

06:02:08.228 --> 06:02:20.722
In 86, the court issued a settlement order in response to litigation with a primary goal, stated goal to reduce racial isolation in Ravenswood with the other area districts.

06:02:21.402 --> 06:02:24.606
That settlement order included a voluntary transfer plan.

06:02:26.206 --> 06:02:33.488
that allows minority students from Ravenswood to transfer into eight other school districts, including Menlo Park.

06:02:34.228 --> 06:02:40.630
Non-minority students from these other districts also under the plan may transfer into the Ravenswood school district.

06:02:41.070 --> 06:02:49.172
The court specifically charged the state board with responsibility for monitoring compliance with the order, including this transfer plan.

06:02:49.773 --> 06:02:54.914
It also gave the board the option to delegate that authority to the county superintendents, which it did.

06:03:01.269 --> 06:03:13.756
In 1992, the State Board heard the first appeal from the Territory Transfer Denial of the San Mateo County Committee that occurred after the Tinsley settlement.

06:03:14.477 --> 06:03:20.420
That area that was proposed for transfer is the exact same area that you're dealing with today.

06:03:22.054 --> 06:03:30.316
At that time, the department recommended that the state board and the county committee, as they did with the current one, they disapprove that.

06:03:30.716 --> 06:03:37.438
And at that time, the department recommended that the state board affirm that action of the county committee to disapprove the territory transfer.

06:03:37.858 --> 06:03:44.740
And our primary reason was that the proposed transfer was directly contrary to the Tinsley Voluntary Transfer Plan.

06:03:46.155 --> 06:03:52.039
The State Board unanimously affirmed the action of the County Committee to disapprove the transfer.

06:03:54.820 --> 06:04:00.804
A lot of the same reasons that the petitioners brought forward in 1992 are the same as today.

06:04:01.945 --> 06:04:07.968
The primary issue is that the transfer area is part of the Willows neighborhood that transferred in 1983.

06:04:09.029 --> 06:04:13.932
Here's a map provided by the chief petitioners for the transfer.

06:04:15.290 --> 06:04:22.234
of the area that they want to transfer from Ravenswood School District to Menlo Park School District.

06:04:23.594 --> 06:04:33.860
Their belief is that they were not part of the city of Menlo Park in 1983 when the area of the Willows neighborhood did transfer.

06:04:34.620 --> 06:04:41.684
And since the boundary of the transfer area was the city boundaries, they didn't transfer, their neighborhood didn't transfer.

06:04:42.778 --> 06:04:48.840
About the same time, Menlo Park annexed that community into the city of Menlo Park.

06:04:48.880 --> 06:04:56.841
So it's now part of the city of Menlo Park, but it's not part of the Menlo Park City School District.

06:04:57.602 --> 06:05:02.543
And I'm sure the chief petitioners are going to go through these reasons in more detail.

06:05:02.563 --> 06:05:04.083
I'm going to go through them rather quickly.

06:05:05.163 --> 06:05:09.865
The transfer, another reason for the transfer is that it will align city and school boundaries in this area.

06:05:11.903 --> 06:05:18.467
As you'll probably hear later, the Menlo Park School District is experiencing some enrollment increases.

06:05:19.027 --> 06:05:23.730
They've reopened a school, the Laurel School Upper Campus there.

06:05:24.330 --> 06:05:26.551
So they believe that's their neighborhood school.

06:05:26.711 --> 06:05:28.152
It's a grade three to five school.

06:05:28.172 --> 06:05:33.575
It used to be a school in Reguinswood School District, but it was part of the transfer in 1983.

06:05:36.889 --> 06:05:43.711
They also note that the proposed transfer area has no community identity with Ravenswood School District or the City of East Palo Alto.

06:05:44.751 --> 06:05:56.015
They believe that this is a local education need and concern because their children deserve a quality public education which they can't receive in the Ravenswood School District.

06:05:56.695 --> 06:06:06.438
And they also finally note that the Pacific Park community, which was a townhouse complex in the Willows area,

06:06:07.031 --> 06:06:13.622
was transferred in 2010 when the State Board reversed a County Committee disapproval of that transfer.

06:06:16.206 --> 06:06:20.193
Both districts, Menlo Park and Ravenswood opposed the transfer.

06:06:21.222 --> 06:06:29.347
Again, I'm going to go through these quickly because I believe the districts are here to address them in more detail in the public hearing section.

06:06:30.547 --> 06:06:38.091
Menlo Park believes that the transfer reflects continuing erosion of diversity, property taxes and assessed valuation from Ravenswood.

06:06:38.852 --> 06:06:46.896
They also believe that the transfer would encourage unwanted future transfers of City of Menlo Park territory from the Ravenswood district.

06:06:47.825 --> 06:07:04.572
The Menlo Park District is looking at increased enrollment due to developments in the area and they think that any additional students will provide challenges for them housing students they have right now or are projected to have.

06:07:05.393 --> 06:07:14.817
All Ravenswood schools are within two miles of the area proposed for transfer while a number of the Menlo Park School District schools are further away.

06:07:15.735 --> 06:07:22.445
And they also believe that the transfer result in significant property value increases to the chief petitioners.

06:07:23.026 --> 06:07:31.919
That is increasing chief property values is one of the nine minimum requirements that we need to look at.

06:07:33.737 --> 06:07:36.298
The Ravenswood School District also opposes.

06:07:37.518 --> 06:07:45.041
Again, they focus on the historical pattern of transfers, exacerbating the racial isolation of students in the district.

06:07:45.602 --> 06:07:50.563
They're concerned that the transfer would create a greater divide between Menlo Park and East Palo Alto communities.

06:07:51.284 --> 06:07:59.607
They referenced the 1992 transfer, saying that was denied previously and the conditions leading to that disapproval remain valid.

06:08:00.487 --> 06:08:06.990
And they also note that under the Tinsley Voluntary Transfer Plan, there are only students leaving the district.

06:08:07.030 --> 06:08:16.893
As I noted earlier, the plan allows for non-minority students to transfer into the Ravenswood School District.

06:08:16.933 --> 06:08:19.134
In reality, that hasn't really happened.

06:08:19.174 --> 06:08:23.256
I think there have been one or two students in the 32 years of the program that have transferred.

06:08:24.182 --> 06:08:32.365
And Ravenswood loses about 160 students a year through the voluntary transfer plan.

06:08:32.405 --> 06:08:39.648
And there are probably about 1,200 students, Ravenswood students right now that are attending these other school districts.

06:08:40.348 --> 06:08:47.511
They have some financial problems in the district and they believe that any additional loss of students will exacerbate their fiscal difficulties.

06:08:50.168 --> 06:08:58.797
Okay, as I mentioned, the County Committee unanimously disapproved the territory transfer, finding that the proposal failed to meet three of the minimum threshold requirements.

06:08:59.538 --> 06:09:05.684
The first is preservation of each affected district's ability to educate pupils in an integrated environment.

06:09:07.144 --> 06:09:23.677
the concern that it will lead to significant increases in school facility costs for the Menlo Park School District and that it will not continue to promote sound fiscal management because of the negative fiscal effects it'll have on the Ravenswood School District.

06:09:25.939 --> 06:09:34.964
I'm going to go through these three and talk about a little bit more detail and talk about the department's analysis and recommendation.

06:09:35.505 --> 06:09:42.749
And then we'll move into an area where we'll talk about some compelling reasons and some concerns that we have with the reorganization itself.

06:09:45.481 --> 06:09:50.702
The first one is the issue about educating pupils in an integrated environment.

06:09:51.142 --> 06:10:04.446
Both, as I've noted earlier, both affected districts expressed concerns that the proposed transfer reflects the continuing erosion of diversity from the Ravenswood community and will have a negative impact on racial isolation of students.

06:10:05.086 --> 06:10:13.788
Appellants in the appeal state that 86% of the neighborhood children in the area proposed for transfer are minority.

06:10:14.752 --> 06:10:18.654
Currently, you know, we don't have the exact number of the petitioner state.

06:10:18.694 --> 06:10:21.916
There are about seven public school students there.

06:10:22.016 --> 06:10:25.038
The Menlo Park estimates there could be as many as 12.

06:10:25.338 --> 06:10:32.082
Either way, there aren't a lot, but only one of those students currently attends Ravenswood School District.

06:10:36.030 --> 06:10:44.653
Our findings, as I noted earlier, Menlo Park District is 40% minority while Ravenswood is over 99% minority.

06:10:45.533 --> 06:10:53.895
Again, referring to that small number of students in the transfer area, we don't think that that will significantly affect racial isolation of students.

06:10:55.856 --> 06:11:01.718
As opposed to the 1992 recommendation when we recommended that the

06:11:02.884 --> 06:11:05.925
transfer at that time would be contrary to Tinsley.

06:11:06.486 --> 06:11:07.606
We've kind of rethought that.

06:11:08.186 --> 06:11:12.629
The Tinsley plan does not directly prohibit territory transfers.

06:11:12.729 --> 06:11:18.871
So we do not find that the proposed transfer now is directly contrary to Tinsley.

06:11:19.252 --> 06:11:22.073
So we find that this condition is substantially met.

06:11:24.174 --> 06:11:28.656
The second involves the increase of school facility cost for the Menlo Park school districts.

06:11:30.652 --> 06:11:38.635
Again, the affected districts note that it will exacerbate difficulties in providing housing for a growing Menlo student population.

06:11:39.235 --> 06:11:44.537
And also on the Ravenswood side, it'll pull out assessed valuation and bonding capacity.

06:11:45.237 --> 06:11:51.979
Per capita assessed valuation and bonding capacity is already the lowest in the county for Ravenswood school district.

06:11:52.964 --> 06:11:57.945
The appellants note that Menlo Park will have capacity for all students into the foreseeable future.

06:11:58.785 --> 06:12:05.307
And the assessed valuation is growing, so that will counter any loss of their property.

06:12:06.907 --> 06:12:13.909
Our findings, again, based on student capacities of the schools and projected enrollment growth that the district provided us.

06:12:14.657 --> 06:12:23.644
We don't see that district-wide that Menlo Park School District will exceed their capacity to house students in the foreseeable future.

06:12:24.665 --> 06:12:28.048
The assessed valuation in Ravenswood District since 2011 has grown 52%.

06:12:31.357 --> 06:12:36.820
still is the lowest per capita in the county because all the other district areas are growing too.

06:12:37.541 --> 06:12:49.308
And again, the small number of students and relatively small assessed valuation in the transfer area should not have significant negative effects on or significantly increase school facility cost.

06:12:49.548 --> 06:12:51.649
So we find this condition is substantially met.

06:12:53.723 --> 06:12:55.724
Second is the fiscal impact condition.

06:12:56.865 --> 06:13:05.051
Affected districts note that Menlo Park's cost would increase by about $167,000 annually.

06:13:05.411 --> 06:13:12.236
Menlo Park is a basic aid district, so they do not receive additional funding for any students to come into the district.

06:13:13.437 --> 06:13:19.962
And as we noted earlier, Ravenswood revenue is important because of its declining enrollment.

06:13:20.652 --> 06:13:28.875
It's lost about 20% of its students in the last 10 years and it's very low per student tax base.

06:13:29.896 --> 06:13:36.518
The appellants note that the Menlo Park costs will be offset by property tax revenue from the area going into the district.

06:13:37.619 --> 06:13:41.160
And again, the tax base in Ravenswood is growing significantly.

06:13:43.143 --> 06:13:46.405
Our findings, Menlo Park District is fiscally healthy.

06:13:47.085 --> 06:13:56.091
Additional costs for the students in this area will be offset by increased property tax revenue and in the greater scheme of things will be minimal.

06:13:57.051 --> 06:14:07.338
The district AV growth over the past five years has increased by 42% far exceeding the Menlo Park enrollment growth over that same period of over 10%.

06:14:09.065 --> 06:14:19.393
Although there are concerns with the Ravenswood District's fiscal health due to declining enrollment issues, the loss of one student and 30 homes should not be significant.

06:14:19.433 --> 06:14:20.934
So we find this condition met.

06:14:22.055 --> 06:14:34.924
Now, before I move into reasons and concerns, I should, as you've probably picked up, we differ from the County Committee on the findings of these three conditions.

06:14:35.364 --> 06:14:37.306
I think it's probably important just to note

06:14:38.050 --> 06:14:40.051
why that might be.

06:14:40.171 --> 06:14:50.854
When we look at the minimum threshold requirements, we only focus on the effects of the area proposed for transfer on those requirements.

06:14:52.355 --> 06:15:04.439
County committees that are dealing with an area where they've seen significant past transfers and are concerned that future transfers are going to be encouraged by

06:15:05.071 --> 06:15:19.577
by actions to approve the current ones, sometimes will, and I believe that San Mateo County Committee considered this, is they will consider that domino effect.

06:15:20.652 --> 06:15:26.614
of future transfers when they look at the, when they look at those minimum threshold requirements.

06:15:27.174 --> 06:15:28.374
I'm not saying, that's not wrong.

06:15:29.334 --> 06:15:31.075
That's just different than the way we look at it.

06:15:31.135 --> 06:15:40.417
We're going to be looking at, as you'll see in a moment, we will look at that domino effect, our concerns with that effect as a concern with the reorganization itself.

06:15:44.167 --> 06:15:59.194
So now, if you agree with us that all these minimum threshold requirements have been met, the next thing that we're going to look at is determine whether there's compelling local educational reason to overturn the county committee's action to disapprove the territory transfer.

06:16:00.195 --> 06:16:06.278
And I'm going to go through these again quickly because they're basically a restatement of some of the reasons for the petition.

06:16:07.436 --> 06:16:14.380
The appellants offer a number of reasons including, again, the timing of the 1983 Willows annexation and territory transfer.

06:16:14.640 --> 06:16:20.403
They believe that their neighborhood should have transferred at that time had it been part of the City of Menlo Park.

06:16:21.703 --> 06:16:32.929
Community identity, they note again that the area is part of the City of Menlo Park and close to the newly opened school of that district, of the Menlo Park School District.

06:16:33.883 --> 06:16:37.644
Again, they see this as a local educational need.

06:16:38.165 --> 06:16:42.506
They claim that Ravenswood cannot provide the quality education that their students deserve.

06:16:43.026 --> 06:16:45.207
They note that this is a unique situation.

06:16:45.487 --> 06:16:50.249
The neighborhood is small with few students and should not set a precedent for future transfers.

06:16:50.269 --> 06:16:54.011
Okay, that's it.

06:16:55.751 --> 06:17:02.874
Now we'll move to concerns that you may want to consider when determining whether or not you want to support

06:17:03.570 --> 06:17:07.173
the county committee's decision to disapprove the territory transfer.

06:17:08.454 --> 06:17:17.242
This map that you see here is a close-up of the, of a smaller area around the proposed transfer area.

06:17:18.303 --> 06:17:19.344
And it,

06:17:21.919 --> 06:17:33.066
It gives, I think, a good depiction of some of the issues that occur when you deal with piecemeal changes, piecemeal transfers, piecemeal alterations of a school district boundary.

06:17:34.007 --> 06:17:37.289
In this case, you can see the area proposed for transfer.

06:17:38.850 --> 06:17:47.757
Petitioners claim that they're isolated from the rest of the city of Menlo Park and, of course, the Menlo Park School District because

06:17:49.937 --> 06:17:50.698
They're not there.

06:17:51.318 --> 06:17:56.339
But that isolation is really a result of the territory transfer.

06:17:57.359 --> 06:18:01.500
If you look at that school at the bottom of the map, that's Willow Oak School.

06:18:02.281 --> 06:18:04.501
That's in the Willows neighborhood.

06:18:04.861 --> 06:18:06.942
It's one of Ravenswood School District.

06:18:07.362 --> 06:18:11.303
And though it looks like there's a large area of the city of Menlo Park,

06:18:12.242 --> 06:18:17.904
around it, and there is, it's VA hospital and other non-residential area.

06:18:18.404 --> 06:18:22.785
So what the transfer has done as there are no students around there.

06:18:22.885 --> 06:18:27.486
It is under the petitioner's definition of isolation.

06:18:27.546 --> 06:18:33.028
It's isolated that school from the rest of the Ravenswood School District.

06:18:33.928 --> 06:18:41.370
Just above the little red area where the proposed transfer area is, is a small section of the city of East Palo Alto.

06:18:42.316 --> 06:18:46.558
that is nestled between the transfer area and the Bayshore Freeway.

06:18:47.458 --> 06:18:52.721
Again, as a result of this territory transfer, the Willows Territory transfer,

06:18:53.277 --> 06:19:04.944
That area of East Palo Alto is isolated not only from the rest of the Ravenswood School, but also to their neighborhood school, which is the Willow Oak School.

06:19:07.965 --> 06:19:17.631
Another concern is that approval, and the districts will probably talk about this in more detail, approval may encourage continued boundary erosion.

06:19:18.031 --> 06:19:19.212
Now, where might that come from?

06:19:19.807 --> 06:19:34.122
Well, for one thing, that little area of East Palo Alto we just talked about, even though they're not part of the city of Menlo Park, they still have some of the same concerns regarding isolation that the petitioners have.

06:19:36.324 --> 06:19:41.730
And as we've already noted, there are large areas of the city of Menlo Park still in the Ravenswood School District.

06:19:44.514 --> 06:19:52.218
Just last September, the city of Menlo Park City Council conducted a education equity forum.

06:19:53.059 --> 06:20:04.204
And as part of that forum, they brought in an expert on school district organization and presented the process for what it would take to transfer territory and rearrange school district boundaries.

06:20:05.105 --> 06:20:08.947
The little school at the top of the map is the Belhaven School.

06:20:09.067 --> 06:20:12.849
That's part of the city of Menlo Park, the Belhaven neighborhood.

06:20:13.870 --> 06:20:22.640
the residents of the Belhaven neighborhood just this past spring started circulating a petition to transfer the Belhaven area out of the Ravenswood School District.

06:20:25.803 --> 06:20:30.749
So this gets us into what I talked about earlier, how we consider

06:20:31.334 --> 06:20:35.735
or how we're going to look at the domino effect of territory transfers.

06:20:37.295 --> 06:20:57.921
A concern that the State Board might consider is that if we see this domino effect and we have additional transfers of territory out, then that enrollment growth due to the transfers may now place pressure on the Menlo Park District's future ability to house students, especially at the middle school level.

06:20:57.941 --> 06:20:59.241
It only has one middle school.

06:21:00.667 --> 06:21:13.556
Similarly, if we use that domino effect as a potential, you know, Ravenswood currently is experiencing fiscal difficulties because of their declining enrollment.

06:21:13.956 --> 06:21:18.739
They, I believe, cut $2.5 million in certificated staff two years ago.

06:21:18.759 --> 06:21:24.083
They just cut another $5 million from their budget for this upcoming year.

06:21:24.983 --> 06:21:30.107
Again, declining enrollment is a big issue for them and for the County Office of Education.

06:21:31.248 --> 06:21:46.560
And finally, even though we do not view the territory transfer as directly contrary to the Tinsley plan, the state board still may consider that it's in violation of the spirit of that plan.

06:21:49.182 --> 06:21:55.947
So in summary, we find that all minimum threshold conditions are met, including the three the county committee determined were not.

06:21:57.168 --> 06:22:04.454
We don't believe that there is any reason compelling enough to overturn the County Committee's disapproval.

06:22:05.174 --> 06:22:18.625
We do have some concerns about piecemeal approaches to transfers and encouraging future erosion that we think are substantial enough to warrant upholding the County Committee's decision to disapprove the territory transfer.

06:22:19.105 --> 06:22:23.969
Therefore, we recommend that the State Board affirm the County Committee disapproval of the transfer.

06:22:25.285 --> 06:22:35.350
So your action today is to either, as I mentioned earlier, to either affirm or reverse the county committee's action to disapprove the proposed transfer of territory.

06:22:36.130 --> 06:22:43.154
If you reverse the county committee action, then thus approving the territory transfer, you then have to establish an election area.

06:22:45.069 --> 06:22:49.270
I'm happy to answer any questions you have now or you can just turn to the public hearing.

06:22:50.210 --> 06:22:55.392
Well, we see if there's any technical questions in the board, which is these are really technical.

06:22:55.832 --> 06:22:58.473
And then we'll proceed to the public hearing and the public comment.

06:22:58.713 --> 06:23:00.753
I mean, I remember stress.

06:23:01.013 --> 06:23:06.055
So, Larry, thank you for your always thorough and look at all the details.

06:23:06.695 --> 06:23:09.176
This map, I just want to go back to the map.

06:23:09.216 --> 06:23:12.397
If you go back a couple of slides, a lot that says potential concerns.

06:23:12.417 --> 06:23:12.597
Yeah.

06:23:12.937 --> 06:23:13.057
So,

06:23:15.259 --> 06:23:19.924
Starting from going across the angle, there's a cut out there.

06:23:20.185 --> 06:23:22.748
Yeah, that's a flood control area.

06:23:25.390 --> 06:23:28.753
When the transfers took place, they didn't include areas that didn't have.

06:23:28.853 --> 06:23:34.157
It's like so weird because usually you see a line between two different districts, not like it jockeyed.

06:23:34.197 --> 06:23:37.699
And the second one that's jockeyed out with the Laurel School down at the bottom, what's that?

06:23:38.159 --> 06:23:43.243
That is a VA hospital, another non-residential area.

06:23:43.704 --> 06:23:53.751
So all of the areas of the city of Menlo Park that jut down below the straighter line, which is the Bayshore Freeway, are for the most part

06:23:54.737 --> 06:23:57.641
Uh, you know, there may be, I don't think there are any students there anyway.

06:23:57.861 --> 06:24:05.229
And my last question, as you said, if we were to, um, if we had to establish an election area, what does that mean?

06:24:05.249 --> 06:24:05.850
An election?

06:24:06.190 --> 06:24:07.732
Well, because the

06:24:09.634 --> 06:24:20.760
there's opposition from the school district, any proposed transfer that either the committee approves and doesn't come here, the county committee approves and doesn't come here, or the state board approves, has to go to an election.

06:24:21.460 --> 06:24:34.007
So the default election area is just the little red area there, the area proposed for transfer, but the state board can expand that election area if they find a reason to do that.

06:24:35.148 --> 06:24:48.219
And I should add that the County Committee has, I forgot to say this earlier, but the County Committee has recommended that the election area, if the territory transfer is approved, be expanded to the whole of Ravenswood School District.

06:24:49.011 --> 06:24:53.152
Yeah, let's come to that when we have to, yeah, or if we have to, yeah.

06:24:53.812 --> 06:24:56.112
The election area, yeah.

06:24:57.073 --> 06:24:58.893
I'm a veteran of these things from the 70s.

06:24:58.993 --> 06:25:06.155
This election is in a very different, somewhat different discussion and where the election area is.

06:25:06.175 --> 06:25:07.555
Right.

06:25:08.055 --> 06:25:11.516
So any other technical comments?

06:25:12.456 --> 06:25:14.496
If not, then I will open the public hearing.

06:25:14.616 --> 06:25:16.037
Each side will have 10 minutes.

06:25:16.157 --> 06:25:17.577
We'll start with the petitioners.

06:25:18.297 --> 06:25:19.358
who want the transfer.

06:26:44.716 --> 06:26:45.837
Can you hear me correctly?

06:26:47.077 --> 06:26:48.218
Yes, go ahead.

06:26:48.458 --> 06:26:48.698
Great.

06:26:51.019 --> 06:26:56.981
Ladies and gentlemen of the board, my name is John Barksell and I'm the Sheep Petitioner for the Oconto Street Petition.

06:26:59.382 --> 06:27:04.404
I wanted to start off with asking you guys a question about what is the difference between these homes?

06:27:06.125 --> 06:27:07.606
Both are single family homes.

06:27:09.146 --> 06:27:10.367
Both are part of Menlo Park.

06:27:11.207 --> 06:27:13.088
Both part of the Willows neighborhood.

06:27:14.048 --> 06:27:17.972
In fact, both are on O'Connor Street and facing each other.

06:27:19.593 --> 06:27:33.287
But I'll tell you what the difference of these homes is that they are separated not only down the middle of the street but also in the center of the block of the two different school districts.

06:27:37.987 --> 06:27:48.914
The aim of today's petition is to incorporate the 31 single-family homes located on O'Connor Street in the Willows neighborhood in the city of Menlo Park.

06:27:50.055 --> 06:28:04.225
Approving our petition today will unify O'Connor Street's community identity, align and restore O'Connor Street's original city and school boundaries, and correct the oversights from the past.

06:28:08.260 --> 06:28:14.203
The Willows neighborhood and the O'Connor Street definitely has a complicated history with different territory transfers.

06:28:15.644 --> 06:28:27.030
But in short, the 31 homes should have been included in the 1983 Willows neighborhood transfer as evident of these measures and election.

06:28:30.529 --> 06:28:38.499
I'd like to point out to you that our proposal meets all nine criteria outlined by the State Board of California Education Code.

06:28:39.760 --> 06:28:47.049
The California Department of Education report prepared by Larry Shirley also includes that we meet all nine criteria.

06:28:49.107 --> 06:29:00.856
There is no dispute that we do not meet the 9th State Board of Education criteria and the only logical decision is to overturn the San Mateo County Board of Education decision.

06:29:03.919 --> 06:29:05.740
So we talk a lot about community.

06:29:06.461 --> 06:29:12.086
Well, we live on O'Connor Street and the Willows is our community.

06:29:12.626 --> 06:29:14.788
The city of Memo Park is our community.

06:29:15.913 --> 06:29:23.598
There is a school less than 500 yards away that we cannot send our kids to that has always been the neighborhood school.

06:29:31.823 --> 06:29:45.471
We are a narrow strip of land isolated by two different cities, three different school districts, and we don't have the benefit of other homes behind us or surrounding us that share the same community.

06:29:46.897 --> 06:29:54.264
we meet the nine criteria just as the Willows did in 1983 when it was annexed into the Menlo Park City School District.

06:29:59.528 --> 06:30:06.094
Again, the CDE recommends that education and integrated environment is substantially met.

06:30:06.955 --> 06:30:14.001
We are only talking about 6 to 12 students depending what SGR ratio that you want to use.

06:30:16.448 --> 06:30:19.989
Our children are now 86% minority.

06:30:20.910 --> 06:30:32.074
Thus, approving this transfer increases the diversity and reduces the segregation of the Menlo Park School District, which as Larry pointed out, is at 40% minority.

06:30:34.306 --> 06:30:41.569
Approving this transfer makes no impact to the Waverenswood School District because currently there are no students.

06:30:42.290 --> 06:30:46.371
I know we said one but now there are no students attending the Waverenswood School District.

06:30:47.572 --> 06:30:56.536
The demographics of our transfer petition is substantially diverse than ever before in the history of our petitions.

06:30:59.697 --> 06:31:01.158
Tinsley is not the answer.

06:31:02.247 --> 06:31:11.232
The Tinsley Volunteer Transfer Program was not intended for students in the Menlo Park community to transfer into the Menlo Park City School District.

06:31:12.172 --> 06:31:25.159
In fact, the true spirit of the transfer was to foster integration for those families from segregated communities to have the opportunity to have an integrated educational environment.

06:31:26.403 --> 06:31:46.677
In fact, if we follow the California Department of Education recommendation and utilize Tinsley with our minority students, we are in fact going to be taking 12 spots out of the available 24 spots of all Raymond's School District for the Tinsley program.

06:31:50.816 --> 06:31:54.018
The California Department of Education talked about enrollment growth concerns.

06:31:54.779 --> 06:32:06.548
I'd like to point out to the recent report that was prepared in November 2017 that you should have in front of your desk that was done by the same consultant that did an earlier enrollment study.

06:32:07.789 --> 06:32:15.235
They are projecting declining enrollment year after year for the next five years in the Menlo Park School District.

06:32:16.846 --> 06:32:28.252
Again, we're talking about the contribution of our 31 homes being between 6 to 12 students across 9 different grade levels and out of 3,000 students.

06:32:33.075 --> 06:32:42.200
The California Department of Education also concluded that the impact, the financial impact is minimal and we do meet the State Board of Education criteria.

06:32:43.490 --> 06:32:49.636
If granted, the Ravenswood City Schools District will lose combined total of out of the 31 homes $6,076 annually.

06:32:49.676 --> 06:32:54.461
That equates to less than 0.15% out of the annual 45 or close to $46 million district budget.

06:33:04.096 --> 06:33:12.080
I'd also like to point out, since this petition started, the bond capacity of the Ravenswood School District has increased by 52%.

06:33:12.640 --> 06:33:21.964
That negates the less than half percent our 31 homes would contribute to the overall bonding capacity of the school district.

06:33:23.885 --> 06:33:29.588
Even more so, the Ravenswood School District home prices have increased by 76% over the last two years.

06:33:34.108 --> 06:33:45.612
and zero students from our 31 homes currently attend Ravenswood School District which would mean a net zero dollar change from the LCFF.

06:33:49.494 --> 06:33:51.314
Now there's a lot of talk about precedent.

06:33:52.795 --> 06:34:03.259
Well I'd like to point out to you that each petition should be weighed on its own merits and not consider previous transfers or potential future transfers to make your decision.

06:34:05.546 --> 06:34:10.230
In fact, we're not an entire neighborhood attempting to move with hundreds of homes.

06:34:11.611 --> 06:34:12.752
We are very unique.

06:34:13.593 --> 06:34:25.283
Since we are just 31 single family homes, we are split down the middle of our street, neighborhood street, into two different school districts and down the center of our block.

06:34:27.225 --> 06:34:28.366
We are part of the Willows

06:34:29.500 --> 06:34:34.613
And if you look at the history, we should have been transferred along with the rest of Willow's neighborhood in 1983.

06:34:40.213 --> 06:34:43.115
Approving this transfer today is actually good public policy.

06:34:43.475 --> 06:35:00.406
I'd like to point out the other letter on your desk from former City of Menlo Park Mayor and current Council Member Kristen Keith that talks about creating a school district boundary like this makes sense and can fix the inaccuracies of the past.

06:35:02.389 --> 06:35:16.081
In fact, the San Mateo County LAFCO that drove the unification of O'Connor Street in 1983 to be in one school or one city also supported the transfer of school district boundaries at that time.

06:35:16.641 --> 06:35:20.305
But as you know, city and school district boundaries don't always go hand in hand.

06:35:23.447 --> 06:35:27.031
I'd like to read the last guiding principles of the City of Menlo Park.

06:35:27.992 --> 06:35:31.956
Schools are intentionally organized as neighborhood as opposed to choice magnet schools.

06:35:32.436 --> 06:35:48.731
The reason for this is that our community values the unique opportunities that neighborhood schools provide to develop strong relationships and deep roots within the community by fostering friendships with other families who live within reasonable biking and walking distance.

06:35:49.412 --> 06:35:51.454
And that is exactly what we are aiming to do.

06:35:52.779 --> 06:36:02.622
Finally today, I would like to ask you to approve this petition because the California Department of Education agrees we meet all nine Board of Education criteria.

06:36:03.562 --> 06:36:05.543
Two, the Willows is our community.

06:36:05.763 --> 06:36:09.504
This is where our families and children play, shop, worship, and vote.

06:36:10.724 --> 06:36:14.185
Three, we are only talking about six to 12 students.

06:36:16.104 --> 06:36:23.267
Four, as Larry Shurer talked about election area, we agree that election area should be restricted to our 31 homes.

06:36:23.727 --> 06:36:34.051
And if you have to look at case precedent, I'll look at the State Board of Education ruling on Pacific Park in 2010 that had a very similar oversight of the Willows neighborhood in 1983.

06:36:36.755 --> 06:36:46.998
And I ask you to prove the errors of the past and reunite us back to the Willows community and the city of Menlo Park and into the Menlo Park School District.

06:36:47.658 --> 06:36:47.998
Thank you.

06:36:52.959 --> 06:36:55.280
Now the opponents will have 10 minutes.

06:37:30.350 --> 06:37:31.290
Let's see here.

06:37:32.310 --> 06:37:33.411
I can do the slides for you.

06:37:37.071 --> 06:37:43.112
Good afternoon, Superintendent Torlakson, President Kirst and trustees.

06:37:44.633 --> 06:37:45.433
We are here.

06:37:45.473 --> 06:37:55.915
My name is Gloria Hernandez and I'm the superintendent of Ravenswood City School District, which is in two cities, Menlo Park and East Palo Alto.

06:37:56.995 --> 06:37:58.216
And we are here.

06:37:58.236 --> 06:38:10.286
I have with me Eugene Clark Herrera from OREC and Shen Green from East Shore Consulting, who are our financial advisors.

06:38:11.788 --> 06:38:19.214
The proposed territory transfer perpetuates a historical pattern of territorial transfers.

06:38:19.234 --> 06:38:20.295
You just saw the slides.

06:38:23.580 --> 06:38:35.989
These transfers have exacerbated rather than ameliorated the racial isolation of students and our entire community in the Ravenswood City School District.

06:38:38.091 --> 06:38:39.732
What we have been going through is

06:38:42.418 --> 06:38:45.181
bleeding out by a thousand cuts.

06:38:46.482 --> 06:38:54.169
Each cut is not enough to kill the organism, but you cut enough and you bleed somebody to death.

06:38:54.989 --> 06:38:58.893
That's what we have been going through over the last few decades.

06:39:01.235 --> 06:39:04.578
I'm here to fight for the survival of my community.

06:39:06.357 --> 06:39:13.662
We strongly believe that the petition has failed on most of the nine statutes.

06:39:16.224 --> 06:39:22.688
As has been stated, there was a similar petition that was denied over 30 years ago.

06:39:23.389 --> 06:39:29.513
And we strongly believe that the rationale for this previous denial remains valid.

06:39:30.822 --> 06:39:36.008
Our community, you're gonna see, you've seen this before, this is the boundary.

06:39:36.028 --> 06:39:37.630
This was Ravenswood.

06:39:39.432 --> 06:39:49.623
And now you're going to see how we have been decimated by these territory transfers over time.

06:39:52.893 --> 06:40:02.651
And I would say that, yes, we would be very happy to bring in communities because they belong to Ravenswood.

06:40:02.711 --> 06:40:04.213
They were taken from us.

06:40:06.866 --> 06:40:16.153
We have ended up with a hub of poverty that has happened over the decades as property values have increased all around us.

06:40:17.274 --> 06:40:24.940
Our funding capacity, while it is growing, is still, as you heard, the lowest in San Mateo County.

06:40:26.514 --> 06:40:41.488
This has really led to our facilities not being able to be maintained, our educational programs suffering, and we have been working very, very hard over the last five to six years to change this dynamic.

06:40:41.929 --> 06:40:46.113
But it's a very difficult battle, and with

06:40:46.633 --> 06:40:51.696
Pieces that are taken away and again With property values going up.

06:40:51.856 --> 06:41:02.383
There's such such a temptation for communities and neighborhoods to want to opt out of our district because their property values will go up and

06:41:07.859 --> 06:41:10.501
I'm Eugene Clark Herrera from ORIC.

06:41:11.441 --> 06:41:12.442
We're council to the district.

06:41:13.002 --> 06:41:13.882
I want to apologize.

06:41:14.203 --> 06:41:21.026
We had an animation in this slide that apparently did not work as it was moved over to your system.

06:41:21.427 --> 06:41:25.449
But you should have in front of you hard copies which show the illustration.

06:41:25.529 --> 06:41:32.573
And I'd like to walk you through that if I may because it's a critical piece of the information we intend to present.

06:41:33.053 --> 06:41:33.974
here this afternoon.

06:41:34.574 --> 06:41:40.838
If you look at slide three, you see the original boundaries of the Ravenswood School District.

06:41:41.939 --> 06:41:54.227
And then if you turn the pages, the next seven slides show you the geographic areas that are the subject of the transfers that Mr. Shirey described in his staff summary.

06:41:55.168 --> 06:42:01.552
And you see that over time, there is without doubt a pattern

06:42:02.322 --> 06:42:03.943
of territory transfers.

06:42:05.044 --> 06:42:13.071
Dr. Hernandez-Goff referred to it as death by a thousand cuts, the petition before you being the next cut in that succession.

06:42:13.611 --> 06:42:20.998
Mr. Shirey referred to a domino effect, this petition before you being the next domino in that succession.

06:42:23.146 --> 06:42:33.689
I want to make one editorial comment before I dive into a few substantive points and then I'm going to turn it over to Mr. Green to make a few additional substantive points on the nine criteria.

06:42:34.089 --> 06:42:38.831
My editorial comment is that I lived in East Palo Alto for four years.

06:42:38.891 --> 06:42:50.294
I attended law school at Stanford and I never formed the sort of divisive sense of I live on this block so therefore this is my community and that.

06:42:50.695 --> 06:42:51.695
I'm going to go into the

06:42:52.495 --> 06:43:13.768
issue of community identity that's raised by the petitioners, but I think the bigger picture point is the peninsula is a community and people who care about education on the peninsula care about Menlo Park students, Ravenswood students, Sequoia students, and Palo Alto students, and that all of those students have the best opportunities that they can.

06:43:14.688 --> 06:43:21.172
And so I, in part, see this petition as undermining that effort in a not constructive way.

06:43:23.353 --> 06:43:47.860
The standard of review that Your board has today over this petition is de novo, which means you are able to consider all nine criteria even though the staff only focused on the three that were opposed or that were not met in the in the view of the County committee, so I'm going to run through all of them again between me and mr. Green with a few minutes we have left and just try to

06:43:49.740 --> 06:44:03.870
Articulate our position that actually Very few of them are met The first is not applicable or before we do think it's met about adequacy of enrollment and I'm on page 12 slide 12 Sorry, I'm jumping through here

06:44:05.316 --> 06:44:07.738
And these slides won't even advance, so I apologize.

06:44:10.541 --> 06:44:22.411
I want to state that we concur at the top level in the staff's recommendation to oppose this petition and support the county committee's decision.

06:44:22.867 --> 06:44:24.068
rejection of the petition.

06:44:25.210 --> 06:44:31.737
On community identity, I just find several logic problems with the petitioner's arguments.

06:44:31.817 --> 06:44:40.146
As I said a moment ago, I think they are equidistant to city centers.

06:44:40.186 --> 06:44:42.129
That's hard to discern from the maps you've seen.

06:44:42.529 --> 06:44:47.731
The East Palo Alto City Center, the Menlo Park City Center, that's a criteria.

06:44:48.251 --> 06:45:00.256
They are actually closer to more Ravenswood schools than they are to Menlo Park schools, even though Menlo Park just opened a three to five campus very close to their homes.

06:45:00.456 --> 06:45:02.757
Junior high schools in Ravenswood are closer.

06:45:03.658 --> 06:45:06.522
I could go on about community identity.

06:45:06.542 --> 06:45:15.475
I think the biggest issue that I find that we find with the way petitioners have framed this argument is that they're using code words like our homes look

06:45:16.421 --> 06:45:24.406
Our homes are single-family homes, and if you read the materials that have been presented, it was not said in this oral presentation, but there are multifamily homes behind us.

06:45:24.466 --> 06:45:25.567
That's not our community.

06:45:25.607 --> 06:45:36.033
Well, to me, that's code for wealth versus poverty and a disassociation from the poverty, and I think that's an inappropriate justification for a territory transfer.

06:45:36.093 --> 06:45:37.834
I think it fails on community identity.

06:45:38.615 --> 06:45:39.735
I'm going to move quickly.

06:45:40.436 --> 06:45:41.656
There is no property divide.

06:45:41.697 --> 06:45:42.757
That's not an applicable

06:45:45.020 --> 06:45:54.555
Criteria I'm going to hit Racial and ethnic integration quickly and then give it to chin with a couple minutes.

06:45:54.595 --> 06:45:56.318
We have left and

06:45:58.340 --> 06:46:08.124
Our position is that any transfer of territory out of this school district necessarily results in a greater concentration of minorities, which is the definition of racial segregation.

06:46:08.444 --> 06:46:21.650
So it could be one home, it could be 33, it could be the entire, it could be hundreds, but any movement of any homes, no matter what kinds of kids live in them, out of this district creates a higher concentration of minority students.

06:46:21.970 --> 06:46:23.411
That's racial segregation.

06:46:23.791 --> 06:46:25.531
It fails on this criteria.

06:46:28.291 --> 06:46:28.611
Thank you.

06:46:28.711 --> 06:46:31.592
I'm Shane Green, a B. Shore Consulting Financial Advisor to the district.

06:46:32.392 --> 06:46:40.754
Just about out of time, but in terms of cost to the state, the reality is, is that the Ravenswood City School District is one of the few state-funded districts in the area.

06:46:41.134 --> 06:46:42.434
Everyone else is basic aid.

06:46:42.794 --> 06:46:43.314
Why is that?

06:46:43.414 --> 06:46:45.795
Because those dominoes that were discussed have already fallen.

06:46:46.255 --> 06:46:47.695
They have taken the territory away.

06:46:47.755 --> 06:46:51.756
If you look at the map and the progress of territory removed, think about the value of that.

06:46:51.796 --> 06:46:53.496
That is prime Silicon Valley land.

06:46:53.756 --> 06:46:55.536
Go straight to this one more time.

06:46:56.057 --> 06:46:57.597
In terms of the...

06:47:00.782 --> 06:47:02.944
primary purposes other than property value.

06:47:03.865 --> 06:47:04.826
Skipping ahead here.

06:47:05.787 --> 06:47:09.790
We took a look at sales reported on the county rolls from 2014-15 on.

06:47:10.051 --> 06:47:13.754
There's an attachment to the back of the presentation where you'll see slides.

06:47:13.774 --> 06:47:15.936
If you want to know what the differential is, it's 20%.

06:47:17.277 --> 06:47:28.320
Homes on the O'Connor Street on this petitioner side are selling for 20% on average over that four or five year period more than the ones on the other side of the street that are already within.

06:47:28.920 --> 06:47:35.642
And so that the petitioners are essentially looking to have homes that sell at a higher value.

06:47:36.462 --> 06:47:41.743
We can't say what their motivations are definitively, but it's very clear that across the street homes sell for more.

06:47:42.804 --> 06:47:43.104
Thank you.

06:47:44.565 --> 06:47:45.547
All right.

06:47:45.728 --> 06:47:53.748
We're now... That concludes the public hearing part of the presentations and now we'll go to public comment.

06:47:56.181 --> 06:47:58.803
Will the following individuals please line up at the podium?

06:47:59.424 --> 06:48:23.023
Ken Hoyle, Ajit Jain, Diana Freitas, Arvind Chakravarti, Purvi Modi, Adele Mazzone, Tom Jackson, Matthew Paik, Tim Fox, Duane Goff, Mel Espinoza, Eric Burmeister, Ahmed Shikholeslami,

06:48:25.445 --> 06:48:30.670
Michael Tucker, Carlos Alcala, John Barksdale, Sarita Jain.

06:48:38.778 --> 06:48:39.319
Thank you very much.

06:48:41.024 --> 06:48:41.505
Good afternoon.

06:48:41.545 --> 06:48:46.329
My name is Ken Hoyle, and I'm a resident of the Willis neighborhood in Menlo Park, California.

06:48:46.890 --> 06:48:51.814
I'm also a resident of the 31 homes in O'Connor Street that we're talking about today.

06:48:52.815 --> 06:48:53.456
I have two boys.

06:48:54.377 --> 06:48:57.280
Both my boys play soccer for AYSO.

06:48:57.300 --> 06:48:59.222
They play for Menlo Park AYSO soccer.

06:48:59.962 --> 06:49:01.344
They play Menlo Park Little League.

06:49:02.325 --> 06:49:04.987
These leagues are defined by city.

06:49:06.232 --> 06:49:06.852
city boundaries.

06:49:07.673 --> 06:49:14.656
So the friends that they have, the friends that they grew up with, the friends they play at the park with, all are Menlo Park residents.

06:49:15.697 --> 06:49:16.757
That's just who we are.

06:49:16.797 --> 06:49:17.778
We're part of Menlo Park.

06:49:17.818 --> 06:49:18.899
We're part of this neighborhood.

06:49:19.619 --> 06:49:22.540
We go sit every Thursday and Friday night.

06:49:22.981 --> 06:49:26.022
They have live bands play at the little local coffeehouse.

06:49:26.603 --> 06:49:27.403
This is our neighborhood.

06:49:27.423 --> 06:49:28.103
This is our home.

06:49:28.724 --> 06:49:29.504
It's important to us.

06:49:31.345 --> 06:49:34.867
But I would like my children to go to school with their friends.

06:49:36.209 --> 06:49:44.133
When we played Little League at the Upper Laurel School, which is right by my house, I threw a baseball to my house from the school.

06:49:44.193 --> 06:49:45.133
That's how close we are.

06:49:46.314 --> 06:49:46.554
Thank you.

06:49:53.575 --> 06:49:54.876
Hello, my name is Ajit Jain.

06:49:55.417 --> 06:49:56.818
I was born in Mexico City.

06:49:57.458 --> 06:49:59.580
My mother, also Mexican, my father from India.

06:50:00.081 --> 06:50:03.844
My grandparents, my grandfather was from Sonora, my grandmother was from Oaxaca.

06:50:04.484 --> 06:50:06.466
When I was almost six years old, we moved to Canada.

06:50:06.506 --> 06:50:07.167
That's where I grew up.

06:50:07.607 --> 06:50:12.071
I grew up in public schools throughout, including college in Canada, and I've been living here since 2002.

06:50:12.571 --> 06:50:14.092
I have three sons.

06:50:14.173 --> 06:50:18.776
My oldest is eight, and he attends Laurel Elementary, the upper school, through the Tinsley Transfer Program.

06:50:19.887 --> 06:50:21.628
He did do the Laurel School until last year.

06:50:21.969 --> 06:50:25.031
I just wanted to speak to the significance of the Willows community in our lives.

06:50:25.672 --> 06:50:31.056
Our lives truly center around the Willows, not just because of our son, but because of our son's friends and their parents.

06:50:31.096 --> 06:50:32.237
They've become our close friends.

06:50:33.658 --> 06:50:35.299
He's very active in sports and activities.

06:50:36.040 --> 06:50:39.302
As Ken said, we're in the Menlo Park Little League because of our address.

06:50:39.923 --> 06:50:44.106
We're in Pac 565 for the Boy Scouts because of our address.

06:50:44.647 --> 06:50:47.749
AYSO Soccer for Menlo Park Atherton because of our address.

06:50:51.204 --> 06:50:52.586
Similarly, excuse me, sorry.

06:50:53.327 --> 06:50:56.390
I was also asked to be a coach for Menlo Park Atherton for next year.

06:50:58.412 --> 06:50:58.673
Sorry.

06:50:59.734 --> 06:51:01.216
My son is also in Spanish immersion.

06:51:01.356 --> 06:51:04.960
I just wanted to say that Spanish immersion in particular is very, very important to us.

06:51:05.441 --> 06:51:08.084
The Laurel community, the Willows community is our home.

06:51:08.504 --> 06:51:10.146
We love it and we thank you for your time.

06:51:10.206 --> 06:51:10.767
Thank you so much.

06:51:16.650 --> 06:51:17.371
Hi, good afternoon.

06:51:17.451 --> 06:51:18.572
My name is Purvi Modi.

06:51:18.592 --> 06:51:23.218
I am a resident of the Willows and my son is, I am Ajit's wife.

06:51:23.498 --> 06:51:24.379
My son is at Laurel.

06:51:24.419 --> 06:51:26.661
He was in part of Tinsley, so it's pure lottery.

06:51:27.362 --> 06:51:30.145
We have two other boys in the morning.

06:51:30.185 --> 06:51:31.267
I want to talk to you about

06:51:32.068 --> 06:51:36.975
We've talked about community, and you've heard a lot of data, but I don't want you to think of us as data.

06:51:37.395 --> 06:51:39.498
My education is an education.

06:51:39.599 --> 06:51:45.647
I was the first person to apply for the UCLA education minor program, did a master's in education.

06:51:45.787 --> 06:51:46.869
I work in education.

06:51:46.989 --> 06:51:47.470
I get it.

06:51:48.451 --> 06:51:54.575
We're taught to think about numbers, but these are little kids, and these are real people.

06:51:55.115 --> 06:51:59.537
My three-year-old son, I want him to go to school at the same district as my eight-year-old.

06:51:59.657 --> 06:52:04.080
My six-month-old son, I want him to have those same experiences, be part of that same community.

06:52:04.720 --> 06:52:05.901
We are part of the community.

06:52:05.961 --> 06:52:07.502
We give back to the community.

06:52:07.542 --> 06:52:08.723
We don't just take from it.

06:52:09.223 --> 06:52:21.452
After this evening, I'm running to back to school night where I'm a homeroom parent, and I have to advocate to 150 third grade parents why they should give to the home apart community, why they should donate to the foundation.

06:52:21.932 --> 06:52:27.096
Feels a little bit weird to be advocating here to say like, I'm part of this community because we are part of it.

06:52:27.136 --> 06:52:27.816
We love it.

06:52:28.277 --> 06:52:28.597
Thank you.

06:52:33.959 --> 06:52:36.722
My name is Diana Freitas, and I have lived in the Willows since 2011.

06:52:38.024 --> 06:52:38.965
I love this neighborhood.

06:52:39.045 --> 06:52:40.807
It's a true community in every sense.

06:52:41.548 --> 06:52:45.593
We often spend our weekends barbecuing at each other's houses and holding our annual garage sales.

06:52:46.013 --> 06:52:51.780
We help each other out, whether it's checking for mail when we're out of town or buying cookies at a local lemonade stand.

06:52:52.521 --> 06:53:01.269
I'm a mother of an 11-month-old, and I've made several friends with new mothers throughout the neighborhood, and we've had numerous playdates at each other's houses and stroller walks through the neighborhood.

06:53:01.669 --> 06:53:07.394
It saddens me that these children will not grow up to attend the same schools, all because we're on the wrong side of the street.

06:53:08.095 --> 06:53:17.864
The school district boundary is down our quiet neighborhood street, not a freeway, not a major roadway, and only half of one side is in a separate school district from the rest of the Willows neighborhood.

06:53:18.244 --> 06:53:19.185
It makes zero sense.

06:53:20.632 --> 06:53:26.054
I won't be able to walk my child to our neighborhood school that is literally like less than 500 yards away.

06:53:26.914 --> 06:53:35.237
I'm a working mother and as it is, I won't be able to lean on my neighbors for carpooling or childcare sharing or discuss common curriculum.

06:53:35.618 --> 06:53:35.898
Time.

06:53:36.378 --> 06:53:39.439
As the saying goes, it takes a village and my village is the Willows.

06:53:39.659 --> 06:53:46.942
I urge the board to support the petition to unite the entire Willows community and give all the children in this neighborhood opportunity to go to school together.

06:53:47.162 --> 06:53:47.422
Thank you.

06:53:52.324 --> 06:53:54.287
Hello and thank you for the opportunity.

06:53:54.487 --> 06:53:57.531
My name is Adela Matson and I am from Mexico.

06:53:58.592 --> 06:54:08.324
When I moved to the Willows neighborhood because my family lived there and my friends and I wanted my kids to grow up with their cousins and my friends' kids.

06:54:10.747 --> 06:54:23.382
But we were not able to do so, and we never realized how difficult it will be having some of our members, family members, go to one school district and then go to another.

06:54:23.863 --> 06:54:27.747
Luckily, we were given a spot through the teen sleep program.

06:54:28.428 --> 06:54:31.089
But with the TNC program, you can't really choose the school.

06:54:31.529 --> 06:54:33.750
You are given a school chosen by the district.

06:54:33.790 --> 06:54:39.492
So my kids went to another school district where we have to drive 25 minutes each way.

06:54:40.293 --> 06:54:42.273
For over 10 years, we did this.

06:54:42.533 --> 06:54:49.256
And even when my kids were little or sick, I had to get one out of bed because we have to drive all the way to school.

06:54:50.957 --> 06:54:53.080
It was very difficult for us, very difficult.

06:54:53.160 --> 06:54:55.062
My kids couldn't hike, couldn't walk.

06:54:55.483 --> 06:55:01.669
And I will ask you to approve our transfer because I don't want my neighbor's kids to go through what I went through.

06:55:01.790 --> 06:55:05.534
I mean, my kids should know our neighbor's kids, which they don't.

06:55:10.817 --> 06:55:13.398
Board members, my name is Tom Jackson.

06:55:13.478 --> 06:55:16.059
I've been a resident of the Willows for over 20 years.

06:55:16.079 --> 06:55:19.301
I want to commend the board for your endurance.

06:55:21.642 --> 06:55:25.303
You must have practiced for this by taking flights to Australia.

06:55:28.806 --> 06:55:33.810
I am here in support of my neighbors who have children.

06:55:35.451 --> 06:55:40.656
And the question that those kids ask is, how come I can't go to school with my friends?

06:55:42.337 --> 06:55:48.102
It's amazing how little children can cut to the very quick of the issue.

06:55:48.302 --> 06:55:50.363
These are kids who want to go to school with their friends.

06:55:50.524 --> 06:55:50.824
Thank you.

06:55:56.618 --> 06:55:57.178
Good afternoon.

06:55:57.218 --> 06:55:58.119
My name is Tim Fox.

06:55:58.179 --> 06:56:00.439
I'm a Deputy County Counsel for the County of San Mateo.

06:56:00.799 --> 06:56:08.182
I'm also the attorney for the San Mateo County Committee on School District Organization, and I'm here to ask that you uphold the decision of the committee in its entirety.

06:56:08.782 --> 06:56:15.665
In addition to representing the committee, I am also the county's desegregation lawyer, which is something I didn't think a person needed to do in the 21st century.

06:56:16.265 --> 06:56:18.566
But it is a task that I take on proudly.

06:56:19.486 --> 06:56:34.060
The reason every local agency that has looked at this issue has determined that the petition should not be granted is that they have seen that over the course of the past 30 or 40 years, the death by a thousand cuts has isolated students in Ravenswood.

06:56:34.640 --> 06:56:45.176
It is a form of surgery where healthy tissue gets cut away, and it gets cut away against the advice of the local agencies, all of which have stood against these petitions every time they've been brought.

06:56:45.696 --> 06:56:48.961
And I was here in 2010 when the Park Pacific petition was brought before you.

06:56:49.382 --> 06:56:50.383
I opposed that then.

06:56:51.064 --> 06:57:04.971
I oppose this now because my committee has determined that granting the petition would isolate students in Ravenswood by eliminating a major source of potential diversity for the Ravenswood schools as all of these folks would be tremendous additions to that district.

06:57:05.291 --> 06:57:05.551
Thank you.

06:57:10.154 --> 06:57:10.775
Good afternoon.

06:57:10.835 --> 06:57:14.080
I prepared to say good morning, but it is now a few hours later.

06:57:14.781 --> 06:57:15.862
My name is Eric Burmeister.

06:57:15.882 --> 06:57:23.332
I'm the superintendent of Menlo Park City School District and here representing also the five elected board members of our school board.

06:57:23.353 --> 06:57:27.078
I'd like to share with you that the Menlo Park City School District supports Ravenswood's

06:57:27.538 --> 06:57:31.644
interest in keeping these residents as part of the Ravenswood School District.

06:57:32.426 --> 06:57:40.437
While many of our board members would also add that there are lots of problems that we need to address with boundary situations, but this is probably not the way to do it.

06:57:40.557 --> 06:57:40.838
Thank you.

06:57:45.427 --> 06:57:46.467
Good afternoon, board members.

06:57:46.768 --> 06:57:48.328
My name is Ahmad Shekhal-Islami.

06:57:48.368 --> 06:57:56.332
I'm the Chief Business and Operations Officer with the Menlo Park City School District, and I've been involved from the beginning in terms of the review of the original petition.

06:57:56.852 --> 06:58:03.395
And we also agree with the county in its denial for the same reasons that have been indicated before.

06:58:04.355 --> 06:58:20.567
As you consider this, if you do change those recommendations, we also would recommend that the election be held by both communities so that the entire community can make a decision and not just by the residents of the street.

06:58:20.928 --> 06:58:21.248
Thank you.

06:58:26.812 --> 06:58:28.133
Hi, dear members of the board.

06:58:28.193 --> 06:58:31.676
My name is Matt Pick and I'm here with my wife and our two boys.

06:58:32.438 --> 06:58:34.159
In the back, you might have heard them.

06:58:34.599 --> 06:58:39.762
We also live in one of the 31 homes, and we are here to ask that you approve our petition.

06:58:40.323 --> 06:58:44.645
Our two sons attend preschool and daycare in the neighborhood just a few blocks away from our house.

06:58:45.165 --> 06:58:47.927
Their friends are our neighbor's children from just across the street.

06:58:48.367 --> 06:58:54.311
Our children share birthday parties, play soccer together, and do all the things that neighbors in the same community do.

06:58:54.691 --> 06:58:58.033
We just want our kids to be able to go to the same school as their friends.

06:58:59.119 --> 06:59:06.924
Each morning as we head out for the day, we see children walking, biking down on our street to get to an elementary school just a few hundred feet away.

06:59:07.644 --> 06:59:10.166
Regarding Tinsley, the application process is a lottery.

06:59:10.586 --> 06:59:14.329
There are only 24 Menlo Park spots for all of the kids in Ravenswood.

06:59:15.409 --> 06:59:20.952
And if a child is selected through the lottery, the receiving school district can place the student anywhere in the school district.

06:59:20.972 --> 06:59:23.953
So it doesn't guarantee that you'll be placed in your neighborhood school.

06:59:24.613 --> 06:59:29.575
In our view, it is by no means addresses the reasons for a time petition.

06:59:30.996 --> 06:59:38.099
At the end of it all, approving this petition will likely have no material impact on both school districts will have a tremendous impact on our time.

06:59:38.559 --> 06:59:41.921
So we ask that you keep that in mind and approve this petition.

06:59:42.001 --> 06:59:42.261
Thank you.

06:59:47.560 --> 06:59:47.980
Hi, folks.

06:59:48.200 --> 06:59:48.960
I'm Arvind.

06:59:49.321 --> 06:59:53.022
I'm an engineer and an immigrant living in one of those 31 homes.

06:59:53.742 --> 06:59:54.622
So I'm not a lawyer.

06:59:54.662 --> 06:59:57.803
I'm not going to be as articulate as the others, but I'm going to speak from my heart.

06:59:58.784 --> 07:00:08.247
And I grew up not getting into a school that my friends and neighbors went to for reasons that were as arbitrary as this case.

07:00:08.767 --> 07:00:11.088
And that was a chip on my shoulder for a really long time.

07:00:12.208 --> 07:00:13.709
I don't want my kids to go through the same.

07:00:14.469 --> 07:00:18.410
Instead, I want them to be able to go to the same school that their neighbors go to.

07:00:19.051 --> 07:00:23.913
I want them to be able to walk and bike to the school that they can see from their front yard.

07:00:24.633 --> 07:00:26.974
I want them to play the same games as their community does.

07:00:28.194 --> 07:00:35.556
As far as I can see, there's no rational reason that has been advanced for us to not be part of Menlo Park School District.

07:00:36.236 --> 07:00:41.137
I want to be able to explain to my kids that most things in life are fair and rational.

07:00:41.797 --> 07:00:43.158
We met all nine criteria.

07:00:43.718 --> 07:00:52.580
This decision will have minimal impact on Ravenswood or Menlo Park, but it'll have a huge impact on the 31 homes, on the half a dozen kids that this decision stands on.

07:00:52.680 --> 07:00:53.040
Thank you all.

07:01:01.038 --> 07:01:03.239
Good afternoon, Dr. Kirst, members of the board.

07:01:03.279 --> 07:01:04.439
My name is Tom Griffin.

07:01:05.079 --> 07:01:14.442
For the last 46 years, I've been an education attorney, including 10 years as the attorney for this board and the State Department and the superintendent.

07:01:15.503 --> 07:01:23.225
In that capacity, I rewrote the law on school district reorganization, which became a State Board of Education proposal.

07:01:24.366 --> 07:01:27.787
And I was intimately involved in desegregation cases.

07:01:29.719 --> 07:01:35.582
The Tinsley decision actually enhances the spirit of Tinsley, not the other way around.

07:01:38.643 --> 07:01:51.388
These are a transfer of a predominantly minority community into Menlo Park, which needs more minority students and doesn't do much of anything to change the demographics of Ravenswood.

07:01:54.089 --> 07:01:58.051
I believe that the petitioners have really been treated unfairly.

07:01:59.649 --> 07:02:05.356
over the years, and the county committee and school district organization can clean up the boundaries.

07:02:05.816 --> 07:02:06.117
Time.

07:02:07.098 --> 07:02:14.687
And they shouldn't be, the parents here shouldn't be held hostage to the county committee for not having done, doing its job.

07:02:15.088 --> 07:02:15.909
Thank you very much.

07:02:28.157 --> 07:02:31.599
Good afternoon, Mr. President, Mr. Superintendent and board members.

07:02:32.280 --> 07:02:33.140
My name is Dwayne Goff.

07:02:33.181 --> 07:02:38.584
I'm a resident of East Palo Alto EPA and a community volunteer.

07:02:38.604 --> 07:02:45.909
And in the interest of transparency, I'm half white, so I'm contributing to the diversity of East Palo Alto.

07:02:48.031 --> 07:02:56.637
This appeal is a continuation of a long history by Mendel Park residents to undermine and take for themselves East Palo Alto resources.

07:02:58.154 --> 07:03:10.341
Part of the Ravenswood City School District is in Menlo Park because Menlo Park used its money and influence to take valuable land from EPA before it could finalize its incorporation as a city.

07:03:10.841 --> 07:03:11.301
This is back in 1985.

07:03:11.481 --> 07:03:12.222
The land was taken in 83.

07:03:14.983 --> 07:03:16.804
Disappeal is about land values.

07:03:17.364 --> 07:03:23.827
The properties in question will increase in value and again, the residents of EPA will lose tax dollars.

07:03:24.548 --> 07:03:32.212
Dollars that are needed by the school district to continue providing a quality education to its children of color who make up 99% of the district.

07:03:33.132 --> 07:03:34.553
It's not about education.

07:03:35.430 --> 07:03:36.632
It's not about neighbors.

07:03:37.413 --> 07:03:39.837
The children don't attend public school.

07:03:40.518 --> 07:03:44.865
Please don't give our assets to Menlo Park, one of the richest districts in the state.

07:03:51.004 --> 07:03:52.825
Good afternoon, long-suffering board.

07:03:54.626 --> 07:03:56.087
My name is Mel Espinosa.

07:03:56.407 --> 07:04:00.450
I'm an administrator, teacher, parent, and community member.

07:04:01.370 --> 07:04:07.915
And I personally have witnessed the devastation, the subtle devastation of encroachment,

07:04:09.335 --> 07:04:13.677
As we have learned earlier, there have been five encroachments over the past two decades.

07:04:14.178 --> 07:04:16.479
And with each encroachment, there is one commonality.

07:04:17.319 --> 07:04:22.742
And that commonality is that segregation has increased and continued to increase.

07:04:22.762 --> 07:04:26.263
This is not about keeping a community together.

07:04:26.323 --> 07:04:27.924
This is about segregation.

07:04:30.365 --> 07:04:31.806
Someone earlier called it isolation.

07:04:31.826 --> 07:04:33.346
No, I choose to call it what it is.

07:04:34.166 --> 07:04:34.866
Segregation.

07:04:35.667 --> 07:04:37.547
And it's not about separate and equal.

07:04:37.587 --> 07:04:38.468
That's not going to work.

07:04:39.028 --> 07:04:40.428
And the Constitution forbids it.

07:04:41.568 --> 07:04:48.971
And so I ask that you please deny this petition because it has non-method criteria set forth by San Mateo County Office of Education.

07:04:50.891 --> 07:04:52.812
I lived and I worked

07:04:53.132 --> 07:04:59.680
in a segregated school district, and I attended one, and it definitely is not a positive thing.

07:04:59.940 --> 07:05:00.241
Thank you.

07:05:04.775 --> 07:05:06.036
Hello, I'm Sarita.

07:05:07.477 --> 07:05:10.921
I've faced racial and other discrimination so often in my life.

07:05:11.041 --> 07:05:24.473
It's so hurtful to hear again and again people accusing us of having ulterior motives, of maybe through some future domino effect causing racial isolation, when we ourselves desire for our children not to be isolated.

07:05:24.893 --> 07:05:28.594
which is what they would probably get if they could get approved through Tinsley.

07:05:28.974 --> 07:05:33.276
They may be commuting for 45 minutes one way in this notorious Bay Area traffic.

07:05:33.656 --> 07:05:37.177
They may not even get approved because chances of Tinsley approval is very slim.

07:05:38.197 --> 07:05:48.461
We live in fear that we cannot take advantage of pooling resources with our neighbors, whether it's for going to school, whether it's for after-school resources.

07:05:49.929 --> 07:05:53.850
People have talked again and again about the fiscal impact of us leaving.

07:05:54.450 --> 07:06:01.272
Ravenswood assessed value has gone up $1.8 billion in the last few years since they last objected.

07:06:01.292 --> 07:06:04.693
They're just worried about losing $25 million.

07:06:04.793 --> 07:06:09.475
That's 7,200% of what they gained in value versus what they're afraid of losing.

07:06:10.535 --> 07:06:21.962
So I really appeal to you to accept a proposal today because you can transform the life of us and our children, but there will be no impact on Ravenswood of approving this transfer.

07:06:21.983 --> 07:06:25.345
There's going to be no negative impact, but a huge impact on us.

07:06:25.385 --> 07:06:26.025
Thank you so much.

07:06:32.809 --> 07:06:34.610
Hello, my name is Carlos Alcala.

07:06:34.630 --> 07:06:38.693
I'm the chair of the Chicano Latino Caucus for the Democratic Party.

07:06:39.697 --> 07:06:44.358
And I've come here to recommend that you support the district in this matter.

07:06:45.598 --> 07:06:58.101
I have represented minority groups in many desegregation cases in Tucson, Houston, Denver, various other cities.

07:06:58.801 --> 07:07:02.782
And what I see, I've been just listening as patiently as the rest of you.

07:07:03.762 --> 07:07:05.943
And I see here that there are two districts.

07:07:06.980 --> 07:07:09.481
One very wealthy, one very poor.

07:07:10.842 --> 07:07:13.082
The wealthy one says it will have no impact.

07:07:13.623 --> 07:07:19.265
The poor one says $500,000 coming out of our budget will have a big effect.

07:07:20.065 --> 07:07:21.365
You're going to be the judge of that.

07:07:22.086 --> 07:07:27.528
What would $500,000 in property taxes pay in that district?

07:07:28.248 --> 07:07:29.528
What effect will that have?

07:07:30.369 --> 07:07:32.810
It will have no effect on Menlo Park.

07:07:33.330 --> 07:07:36.271
It will have every effect on the poor district.

07:07:39.744 --> 07:07:43.587
Okay, that completes the public comment and the public hearing.

07:07:44.247 --> 07:07:47.029
So now we're ready for board member deliberations.

07:07:49.431 --> 07:07:53.774
We're going to start with our liaison for this area, Bruce Holliday.

07:07:55.575 --> 07:07:57.417
Single liaison for this area.

07:07:57.457 --> 07:07:59.178
I want to make sure you all remember that.

07:08:00.579 --> 07:08:01.599
I'm in this one alone.

07:08:01.619 --> 07:08:08.584
First of all, Larry, thank you again for all your work, all your team's work.

07:08:08.644 --> 07:08:09.265
You do bring

07:08:09.997 --> 07:08:13.079
a really balanced approach to your presentation.

07:08:13.119 --> 07:08:17.862
You do explain things in great detail for those of us who don't understand all of those details.

07:08:19.263 --> 07:08:20.604
And thank you so much for that work.

07:08:22.385 --> 07:08:24.726
You don't have to make the vote, though, but we do.

07:08:24.786 --> 07:08:25.647
And this is a tough one.

07:08:26.127 --> 07:08:27.288
This is not an easy one.

07:08:27.628 --> 07:08:32.911
And I have a great deal of empathy and sympathy for both sides of this issue.

07:08:34.904 --> 07:08:40.389
I want to point out a couple things, and then I'm happy to go ahead and make a motion at this point.

07:08:40.469 --> 07:08:44.614
But if at the same time there's a lot of discussion, that's fine with me, of course.

07:08:45.254 --> 07:08:45.995
But we can't hear you.

07:08:47.396 --> 07:08:47.717
Sorry.

07:08:48.818 --> 07:08:53.883
So a few points I want to make ahead of time, and then I'm prepared to make a motion.

07:08:53.943 --> 07:08:57.326
But at the same time, if there's a lot of board discussion, that's fine as well.

07:08:58.604 --> 07:09:08.369
A reminder that city boundaries are not always related to district boundaries.

07:09:09.270 --> 07:09:13.912
I come from the Midwest where they were, but that's not the way here.

07:09:14.012 --> 07:09:21.957
And there were, over the years, very logical and good reasons for those decisions.

07:09:23.278 --> 07:09:25.239
This will not be precedent-setting.

07:09:26.368 --> 07:09:29.512
in the sense that it is not a legal decision.

07:09:29.592 --> 07:09:32.115
It's not a court ruling, judge ruling, that sort of thing.

07:09:32.576 --> 07:09:39.805
And just the way with charter schools, we can make choices as each appeal comes to us.

07:09:43.329 --> 07:09:44.591
The problem here, though, is

07:09:47.788 --> 07:09:58.574
this realm, this area, not just the 31 houses, but Ravenswood and Menlo Park, they have a serious reorganization problem on their hands.

07:09:59.214 --> 07:10:03.757
And it cannot be solved in bits and pieces, in my opinion.

07:10:04.257 --> 07:10:12.262
Instead, I think it has to be solved with both communities coming together in a larger format in order to make

07:10:13.223 --> 07:10:19.509
really good choices for lots of families and not just this pocket or that pocket.

07:10:20.330 --> 07:10:32.883
I do believe that moving any houses out of Ravenswood at this point, one or 31 or whatever, as painful as not being able to go to a school 500 yards away,

07:10:34.484 --> 07:10:50.813
is moving any houses out of Ravenswood at this point, after all of these years and all of these problems, does increase the concentration of minority population in Ravenswood and does increase segregation.

07:10:51.353 --> 07:10:54.555
And I move to support the CDE recommendation.

07:10:56.837 --> 07:10:57.098
Okay.

07:10:57.338 --> 07:10:58.442
Is there a second?

07:10:58.662 --> 07:10:58.963
Second.

07:10:59.184 --> 07:11:00.588
Second by Ortiz-Lacombe.

07:11:00.828 --> 07:11:02.152
Patricia Smith.

07:11:02.854 --> 07:11:04.017
Board member Ruckers next.

07:11:05.777 --> 07:11:07.899
Okay, so I just want to ask a question.

07:11:08.079 --> 07:11:13.485
Looking at the presentation that you're making, Larry, I always appreciate the work that you do.

07:11:13.565 --> 07:11:17.088
I learn so much each time you put these presentations together.

07:11:17.569 --> 07:11:22.654
The statute requires this analysis about the threshold conditions.

07:11:23.174 --> 07:11:28.119
But meeting the threshold conditions, whether they're met or not met, well, let me change that.

07:11:28.659 --> 07:11:38.722
Meeting the threshold conditions is not the reason that would compel a decision that the board or even the county would make.

07:11:39.203 --> 07:11:48.666
So, I heard a lot from the appellants that the petition should be approved because they met the conditions.

07:11:49.226 --> 07:11:55.748
But what I want to hear from you is what does it mean to have a reason compelling enough

07:11:56.519 --> 07:11:58.100
to make this determination?

07:11:58.200 --> 07:12:01.621
What is a compelling reason or what would be an example?

07:12:01.981 --> 07:12:09.425
Because just simply meeting the nine threshold conditions alone is not a compelling reason to approve their petition.

07:12:09.465 --> 07:12:10.765
And I'm very clear on that.

07:12:12.326 --> 07:12:14.367
Well, when you first started,

07:12:15.676 --> 07:12:18.518
I have a hard time knowing if this is on or not.

07:12:18.638 --> 07:12:19.458
I'm assuming it is.

07:12:19.978 --> 07:12:24.000
When you first started, I thought you were going to go into a court case in 1981.

07:12:24.240 --> 07:12:29.163
I was, but I decided to let you go.

07:12:29.743 --> 07:12:41.669
That's the case that made the determination that these are minimum threshold requirements and meaning it does not compel the State Board that you have to find other reasons.

07:12:42.089 --> 07:12:44.351
What those reasons are, that's, you know, what

07:12:45.478 --> 07:12:51.704
The way we look at that, the way our, in the past, is that we have to look at this as a value judgment.

07:12:53.085 --> 07:12:58.070
Once these conditions are met, once you determine that these conditions are met, you have to make a value judgment on this.

07:12:58.991 --> 07:13:02.294
And that's, you know, it could be anything.

07:13:02.314 --> 07:13:03.395
I mean, you could...

07:13:04.790 --> 07:13:10.935
You could use the nine conditions being met as a reason if you think that's compelling enough.

07:13:10.955 --> 07:13:13.196
That's all it needs to do is meet the conditions.

07:13:13.497 --> 07:13:14.497
That's up to this board.

07:13:16.179 --> 07:13:20.182
Pretty much anything you want to use that you think is relevant here is a compelling reason.

07:13:20.962 --> 07:13:23.504
The issue of what we look at is

07:13:24.825 --> 07:13:28.368
You know, if the tables were turned, we would look at this.

07:13:28.849 --> 07:13:43.061
We might recommend, shouldn't say we would look, but we might recommend to you that this whole idea of a domino effect and potential future transfers is a compelling reason to support the County Committee's decision.

07:13:44.802 --> 07:13:48.145
That would probably be the most prominent one in my mind right now.

07:13:48.948 --> 07:14:06.633
But in terms of what are examples, certainly the ones that come up are things like effects on students, effects on... It's hard to come up with something that's definitive.

07:14:07.433 --> 07:14:14.715
It's up to this board to make a value judgment on the proposal and on the action of the county committee.

07:14:15.086 --> 07:14:15.728
Okay, thank you.

07:14:15.948 --> 07:14:23.668
You know, we heard a lot of things, a lot of issues that were raised today about the community, about segregation, about property values.

07:14:25.544 --> 07:14:36.575
And I agree with the findings from the department that there really is no compelling reason to overturn the recommendations that have come both from the district and from the county committee.

07:14:36.635 --> 07:14:37.976
So, I understand that.

07:14:37.996 --> 07:14:47.325
But I wanted to make sure that I heard very clearly this explanation because I didn't hear from the presentation from the appellants what their compelling reason was.

07:14:47.885 --> 07:14:51.747
for asking the board to overturn the recommendation.

07:14:52.187 --> 07:15:03.112
I will say this that, you know, I came on to the board just after the last decision concerning doing this chopping off from Ravenswood.

07:15:03.132 --> 07:15:10.616
You know, there is this other action or behavior that happens from government entities on redlining schools or redlining communities.

07:15:11.016 --> 07:15:13.416
that really does happen to communities of color.

07:15:13.897 --> 07:15:15.937
And so, I am sensitive to that concern.

07:15:15.957 --> 07:15:20.958
And for me, that's a compelling reason not to approve the request from the appellant.

07:15:20.998 --> 07:15:24.799
So, thank you very much for talking me through that.

07:15:24.839 --> 07:15:37.441
Just as an aside, you know, we kind of made the assumption that the reasons that the appellants or the chief petitioners put in their petition are the compelling reasons that they would argue.

07:15:37.461 --> 07:15:37.761
And that's

07:15:38.142 --> 07:15:40.886
And we, that's how we listed them in our presentation.

07:15:41.427 --> 07:15:41.748
Thank you.

07:15:42.169 --> 07:15:44.032
Board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

07:15:45.771 --> 07:15:50.674
I did second the motion, though I'm not dismissing what this means to the families.

07:15:51.275 --> 07:15:52.175
I'm a parent.

07:15:52.275 --> 07:16:00.100
I've had to navigate the choice process so that my children could attend a school that was nearby but not close enough to be my home school.

07:16:01.081 --> 07:16:02.362
I've been on both sides of it.

07:16:02.402 --> 07:16:04.343
I've been the person you want to run away from.

07:16:04.523 --> 07:16:07.585
I'm that part of that community that you don't want to be associated with.

07:16:07.905 --> 07:16:11.587
And I'm also now part of the community that has this willow effect.

07:16:12.688 --> 07:16:19.654
So I know I've seen it all in terms of how this looks because I'm also an urban planner.

07:16:20.094 --> 07:16:26.439
So when I look at this map and maybe 1967 taking that little slither wasn't going to be a big deal.

07:16:26.459 --> 07:16:31.203
And then when they came back in 1976 for a piece, a little piece more, and then 77.

07:16:32.404 --> 07:16:43.997
But this is exactly what white flight and suburbanization, this is what happens when there are some undertones, when there are code words that lead people to want to get away from other people.

07:16:44.918 --> 07:16:50.385
When I was looking at one of the reasons is area children deserve a quality public education.

07:16:50.985 --> 07:16:53.707
All kids deserve a public quality education.

07:16:54.047 --> 07:17:00.791
This is not something that should be reserved for middle class children, whether you're racially diverse or not.

07:17:00.831 --> 07:17:03.112
This is something that we should aim for all children.

07:17:03.392 --> 07:17:07.635
But the fact that that is one of the reasons that their children cannot attend

07:17:08.816 --> 07:17:13.444
Ravenswood District really speaks to that coding that we're seeing.

07:17:13.824 --> 07:17:16.008
And I can't look at 31 families.

07:17:16.128 --> 07:17:17.991
I have to look at this systemically.

07:17:18.031 --> 07:17:18.772
What does this mean?

07:17:18.832 --> 07:17:20.314
What is the precedent that we're setting?

07:17:20.635 --> 07:17:21.917
Because people in 1967 didn't do that.

07:17:23.379 --> 07:17:27.601
People in 1976 didn't do that when they were racially isolating the community.

07:17:27.941 --> 07:17:31.403
So we have people in 2018 are not doing that.

07:17:31.723 --> 07:17:35.125
And so we need to be aware of what this means in the long run.

07:17:35.345 --> 07:17:37.225
Historically, we are setting precedent.

07:17:37.606 --> 07:17:43.648
And so and we are, you know, taking away from a community and racially isolating it.

07:17:43.689 --> 07:17:48.631
And we need to be aware of that, whether it's one child, 31 homes or thousands of residents.

07:17:49.951 --> 07:17:50.712
Board Member Strauss.

07:17:51.576 --> 07:17:54.499
So I just have some clarifying questions.

07:17:54.519 --> 07:17:56.140
I just this is emotional.

07:17:56.360 --> 07:17:58.322
I really feel I feel for Ravenswood.

07:17:58.342 --> 07:18:02.045
I feel for Menlo Park and I feel for the parents and the community on that 31 homes.

07:18:02.445 --> 07:18:07.690
And I guess my question is as a parent and grandparent thinking about the kids across the street.

07:18:07.970 --> 07:18:15.036
Do we know the reason why that line was drawn in the middle of the street where they didn't at least let the whole block go to one district?

07:18:15.076 --> 07:18:16.337
Do we know why that happened?

07:18:17.578 --> 07:18:18.819
Was it not built at the time?

07:18:19.039 --> 07:18:32.853
It was built, but when the 1983 transfer was approved, the petition was to transfer only the city of Menlo Park portion of the willows.

07:18:33.233 --> 07:18:38.799
And at that point in time, that the city boundary ran, that was a city boundary.

07:18:44.385 --> 07:18:44.965
Okay.

07:18:46.766 --> 07:19:01.613
The comment I would make on this is that it's sort of a time warp in the sense that the racial, the word race has changed a great deal from when I looked at these in the 1970s.

07:19:01.753 --> 07:19:05.675
It was white people and black people, mostly in the Ravenswood area.

07:19:06.175 --> 07:19:09.297
Now we have a mixture of people that are

07:19:10.537 --> 07:19:13.520
called racial, although ethnicity is in here too.

07:19:13.640 --> 07:19:19.404
So I think somewhat this policy needs to be revamped.

07:19:20.125 --> 07:19:26.570
I would say another thing here that our finance formula in California isn't driven by race.

07:19:26.650 --> 07:19:29.813
It's driven by low income and English learners.

07:19:31.014 --> 07:19:37.721
And that doesn't appear anywhere in this conversation, you know, that the income levels may be different.

07:19:37.841 --> 07:19:40.604
You don't even have, you presented us with nothing on this.

07:19:41.685 --> 07:19:47.211
So it, to me, I would recommend for the future that the board

07:19:47.971 --> 07:20:10.658
uh and the department try and think of this of this whole issue of reorganization in the new california uh because it's been framed just like it was framed back in the middle 70s to me and and i think we have some work to do here so um uh so that since we've clarified on judgments uh you know i think we

07:20:11.178 --> 07:20:15.261
where you can make a judgment, as well as looking at these nine criteria.

07:20:15.741 --> 07:20:17.362
Same damn stuff was around in 1975.

07:20:17.402 --> 07:20:22.146
And a lot's changed in California since 1975.

07:20:23.867 --> 07:20:32.393
In this area, we have a firm called Facebook, which is in this very area, transforming it before our eyes.

07:20:33.074 --> 07:20:39.078
And it doesn't seem to me that the way the criteria are drawn up for these organizations

07:20:39.578 --> 07:20:45.040
is really up to speed for what I think is a new California in that regard.

07:20:45.140 --> 07:20:47.661
So, that's my closing comment.

07:20:47.721 --> 07:20:52.003
If there are any other comments, we can have them or we have a motion.

07:20:53.984 --> 07:20:54.664
Okay.

07:20:54.764 --> 07:20:57.705
Are we ready to vote?

07:20:58.526 --> 07:21:00.507
All those in favor of the motion, raise your hands.

07:21:01.747 --> 07:21:02.227
Okay.

07:21:02.327 --> 07:21:04.748
It carries then with one abstention.

07:21:05.709 --> 07:21:06.429
One abstention.

07:21:06.589 --> 07:21:06.949
Okay.

07:21:07.049 --> 07:21:08.810
We're on then to the next item.

07:21:09.434 --> 07:21:12.955
which is item five, another reorganization.

07:21:14.135 --> 07:21:16.235
And another reorganization in San Mateo County.

07:21:17.716 --> 07:21:23.737
In this case, we have an appeal from the La Honda Pescadero Unified School District.

07:21:24.497 --> 07:21:33.859
The county committee approved the transfer of territory out of La Honda Pescadero into the Port Talbot Valley and the Sequoia Union High School District.

07:21:35.311 --> 07:21:44.061
I'm not doing a PowerPoint presentation, but if you look at the map on page two of attachment one, you can get a view of where this area is.

07:21:44.702 --> 07:21:53.352
At ten homes that are on a mountain range to the east and to the north is the Portola Valley area.

07:21:53.932 --> 07:21:57.556
To the west and the south is La Honda Pescadero.

07:21:57.897 --> 07:22:10.910
La Honda Pescadero is primarily rural, stretches down from the mountains to the Pacific Ocean, while the Portola Valley District contains the city of Portola as well as a portion of the city of Woodside.

07:22:11.571 --> 07:22:17.201
Petitioners brought forward the petition to transfer territory for a number of reasons.

07:22:17.982 --> 07:22:24.092
One is that no students from this area have attended La Honda Pescadero for at least 30 years.

07:22:25.333 --> 07:22:29.816
They've been attending Portola Valley on inter-district transfers.

07:22:30.536 --> 07:22:35.119
The middle school and the high school in La Honda Pescadero or down in Pescadero near the coast.

07:22:35.359 --> 07:22:44.424
They're about 17 miles away and it's further away than the middle school and the high school for in Portola Valley and Sequoia Union High School District.

07:22:45.305 --> 07:22:52.149
And we have the same community identity argument and reason that we see in most reorganization proposals.

07:22:52.824 --> 07:22:56.210
Petitioners don't feel they have any community identity with La Honda Pescadero.

07:22:56.530 --> 07:22:58.834
Everything they do, where they work, where they shop, etc.

07:22:58.874 --> 07:22:59.836
is in Portola Valley.

07:23:00.697 --> 07:23:06.527
The County Committee unanimously approved the transfer after finding all the threshold conditions met.

07:23:08.566 --> 07:23:16.552
And both the, neither the Portola Valley nor the Sequoia High School District are on record either opposing or supporting the transfer.

07:23:16.953 --> 07:23:20.756
But again, La Honda Pescadero is in opposition and has filed the appeal.

07:23:21.676 --> 07:23:28.322
They point to the fact that the reorganization fails to meet five of the conditions.

07:23:29.301 --> 07:23:34.225
I'm just going to combine their reasons with our analysis in the interest of time.

07:23:34.886 --> 07:23:39.450
One is that the reorganized districts will be adequate in terms of size.

07:23:39.470 --> 07:23:52.782
State Board has a regulation on this issue that you should not form any new district that will be direct service or, you know, depend on the state or a county for additional support.

07:23:53.402 --> 07:24:03.731
And those numbers are 901 students for elementary districts, 301 for high school and 1,501 for unified school districts.

07:24:04.172 --> 07:24:07.315
Both of these districts are currently direct service districts.

07:24:07.835 --> 07:24:11.659
La Honda Pescadero as a unified school district has about 320 students.

07:24:13.400 --> 07:24:18.647
the Portola Valley Elementary School District has around 600 or so.

07:24:20.389 --> 07:24:24.494
La Honda Pescadero claims that this condition is not met because they are

07:24:27.495 --> 07:24:32.860
more, their enrollment is further away from the standard than Portola Valley's.

07:24:33.180 --> 07:24:37.224
But again, that's not the requirement we're looking at.

07:24:37.745 --> 07:24:40.487
It's are we creating a new direct service district?

07:24:40.547 --> 07:24:41.608
And no, that's not the case.

07:24:41.748 --> 07:24:43.630
Districts are already direct service districts.

07:24:44.531 --> 07:24:49.095
The second requirement is that the school districts are each organized on the basis of community identity.

07:24:49.963 --> 07:25:00.607
LaHonda Pescadero notes that the proposed transfer area is in unincorporated San Mateo County territory as is the entirety of the district.

07:25:01.267 --> 07:25:09.830
And that the petitioner should not be using proximity to communities or their commute routes to work as a reason for community identity.

07:25:10.410 --> 07:25:14.433
You know, we agree to a little bit with the district.

07:25:14.473 --> 07:25:20.136
There is some community identity between the transfer area and La Honda Pescadero.

07:25:20.156 --> 07:25:24.699
But there's also community identity with that community and the Portola Valley.

07:25:25.139 --> 07:25:32.524
So, no matter what the reorganization outcome is, the districts will be organized on the sense of community identity.

07:25:34.127 --> 07:25:43.310
The third requirement is that when we dealt with the last time is that the districts will be able to educate students in an integrated environment.

07:25:44.691 --> 07:25:52.093
The La Honda Pescadero points out that they have a better, they have more integration in their district.

07:25:52.153 --> 07:25:54.674
They are about 65% minority versus 24% minority.

07:25:54.694 --> 07:25:55.054
But again,

07:25:58.598 --> 07:26:03.240
There are no students in this area that are attending La Honda Pescadero.

07:26:03.260 --> 07:26:11.283
So moving the territory will not take any students out or put any students in any given district.

07:26:11.343 --> 07:26:18.866
The fourth requirement is that the proposed reorganization is primarily designed for purposes other than to significantly increase property values.

07:26:20.322 --> 07:26:28.486
the district points out that they don't have, they don't have any direct evidence that the primary reason for the reorganization is to increase property values.

07:26:28.946 --> 07:26:35.730
But they do note that there are a lot of things that can go into increasing the property, property values.

07:26:35.950 --> 07:26:40.272
You know, Portola Valley has higher test scores, the proximity to Stanford.

07:26:41.273 --> 07:26:49.277
They note, the district also notes that, that since the kids are all, the students already attend Portola Valley on inter-district transfer.

07:26:49.898 --> 07:27:01.302
and that a lot of the parents in the neighborhood don't have kids and that's a reason for them to believe that the reorganization is designed primarily to increase property values.

07:27:02.442 --> 07:27:03.122
We disagree.

07:27:03.563 --> 07:27:07.724
The district itself notes that there is no direct evidence to support that.

07:27:08.502 --> 07:27:15.706
And finally, the fifth condition is the fiscal effect on La Honda Pescadero.

07:27:16.666 --> 07:27:32.415
They have a number of reasons, but I'm only going to point to the primary one, which is as a basic aid district, the loss of assessed valuation from these 10 homes, they believe will have negative fiscal effects on the district.

07:27:33.343 --> 07:27:35.805
Again, it's not a large area.

07:27:36.506 --> 07:27:40.829
It's about 0.7% of the assessed valuation of the district.

07:27:40.849 --> 07:27:49.456
So we don't believe that there is any negative effect on the fiscal status of La Honda Pescadero.

07:27:50.237 --> 07:27:56.302
So in summary, we agree with the County Committee that all nine conditions are met.

07:27:57.119 --> 07:28:03.829
and we support or we recommend that the State Board support or affirm the action of the County Committee.

07:28:05.171 --> 07:28:08.877
If you do... Yeah, okay.

07:28:10.640 --> 07:28:13.501
I want to announce before we begin the public hearing.

07:28:14.681 --> 07:28:16.282
We're ready for that, Larry, or not?

07:28:16.542 --> 07:28:17.382
We're doing both.

07:28:17.642 --> 07:28:18.062
There are two.

07:28:18.123 --> 07:28:18.363
Yeah.

07:28:18.463 --> 07:28:18.783
Okay.

07:28:18.883 --> 07:28:19.203
I will.

07:28:19.423 --> 07:28:19.683
I will.

07:28:19.883 --> 07:28:36.849
We're going to hear these items five and six together because they both are the appeals of the same underlying petition to transfer territory from La Honda Pescadero Unified School District to the Portola Valley Elementary School District in Sequoia Union.

07:28:37.669 --> 07:28:56.902
So we're going to combine them and since we're combining two of the appeals, we will then give 15 minutes to each side to present their opening and their comments, either pro or con, once I start the public hearing.

07:28:58.191 --> 07:28:58.371
Right.

07:28:58.391 --> 07:29:11.837
So again, in summary, for the first appeal, we recommend that the State Board affirm the action of the County Committee and establish the election area as just the home proposed for transfer.

07:29:12.257 --> 07:29:15.598
Now, that is a point where we disagree with the County Committee.

07:29:15.899 --> 07:29:23.782
The County Committee recommends that the election area be expanded to the entire La Honda Pescadera Unified School District.

07:29:26.800 --> 07:29:45.001
But I should note that even if you set the election area as just these homes proposed for transfer, because Lejando Pescadero is as small as it is, the education code states that if the district opposes the transfer, the election area by statute,

07:29:46.092 --> 07:29:48.233
has to be expanded to the entire district.

07:29:49.113 --> 07:29:53.535
So... Okay, good.

07:29:53.875 --> 07:30:02.959
The second appeal is... Only if there are... We'll open the public hearing if there are questions after the questions, technical questions by the board members.

07:30:03.179 --> 07:30:03.299
Yeah.

07:30:03.579 --> 07:30:10.522
And the second appeal is based on... It comes from this decision of the county committee to expand the election area by the chief petitioners.

07:30:12.003 --> 07:30:21.709
If you take action on the first appeal, there's no reason to hear this because if you affirm the action of the county committee, you have to set the election area.

07:30:22.749 --> 07:30:27.552
And if you reverse the county committee, the territory transfer is denied and there's no election.

07:30:27.892 --> 07:30:35.557
So our recommendation there is that if you take action on the first appeal, that you summarily deny review of the second.

07:30:37.970 --> 07:30:40.932
Okay, technical questions, board member Ortiz-Lacon.

07:30:42.313 --> 07:30:46.316
I couldn't find it in the item, but the parcel to be transferred, you said it's seven homes?

07:30:46.817 --> 07:30:47.217
Ten homes.

07:30:47.457 --> 07:30:47.958
Ten homes.

07:30:48.058 --> 07:30:49.259
And some undeveloped.

07:30:49.779 --> 07:30:50.680
And underdeveloped.

07:30:50.720 --> 07:30:59.066
So that piece of it, that those parcels of land that are vacant, are they, could they potentially be developed into housing units or they're not?

07:31:00.447 --> 07:31:01.068
Undeveloped.

07:31:01.548 --> 07:31:03.289
These are areas that can't be developed.

07:31:03.509 --> 07:31:04.090
Okay, great.

07:31:06.011 --> 07:31:06.692
Other questions?

07:31:09.420 --> 07:31:09.660
Yes.

07:31:10.521 --> 07:31:11.021
Board member?

07:31:11.681 --> 07:31:14.483
Once again, just to clarify.

07:31:16.884 --> 07:31:33.273
If we set the election area, the district, because of its size, can demand the election area include the entire district?

07:31:34.000 --> 07:31:43.387
Well, the opposition, the fact that the district opposes it under statute requires the election area to be expanded to the whole district.

07:31:43.487 --> 07:31:43.807
Thank you.

07:31:44.047 --> 07:31:56.296
The difference is there is that the county pays for the portion of the election that's in the territory proposed for transfer, but the La Honda Pescadero district will have to pay for the cost of the expanded election area.

07:31:59.355 --> 07:32:02.257
Okay, I guess we're ready for the public hearing then.

07:32:02.477 --> 07:32:12.563
And so, we'll first hear for the petitioners that support the CD recommendation and for the transfer.

07:32:24.570 --> 07:32:25.250
Right here on the screen.

07:32:30.720 --> 07:32:32.501
Our presentation is the current one.

07:32:32.521 --> 07:32:32.701
Okay.

07:32:32.721 --> 07:32:33.001
Terrific.

07:32:33.041 --> 07:32:42.868
You might want to just make it a slideshow.

07:32:44.389 --> 07:32:44.629
Like that?

07:32:44.649 --> 07:32:45.170
Okay.

07:32:47.131 --> 07:32:47.792
Good afternoon.

07:32:48.212 --> 07:32:52.535
I'm John Ellis, Chief Petitioner of the Lahonda Road Territory Transfer Petition.

07:32:53.846 --> 07:32:59.391
I'll address the reasons for the petition and then my counsel, Chris Skinnell, will speak to the legal issues.

07:33:00.832 --> 07:33:12.622
Our 10 houses are in the Skylanda community in San Mateo County near the ridge of the Santa Cruz Mountains separating Silicon Valley from the coastal communities of the county.

07:33:13.803 --> 07:33:22.650
Almost all of Skylanda is in the Portola Valley School District to the east, but our houses are just across the border in the La Honda Pescadero School District.

07:33:24.386 --> 07:33:31.594
As shown on the map in the handouts, our homes are 17 miles from the middle and high schools in La Honda, Pescadero.

07:33:33.015 --> 07:33:37.500
17 miles along rural roads in the opposite direction of where we all work.

07:33:38.701 --> 07:33:44.427
We drive east to Silicon Valley, going past the Portola Valley and Sequoia Union school districts.

07:33:45.677 --> 07:33:54.119
To attend La Honda Pescadero, our children would spend one hour and 45 minutes each day traveling to school.

07:33:54.959 --> 07:34:04.781
Not only would this be a severe burden, but it would be nearly impossible for them to participate in extracurricular activities and socialize with classmates.

07:34:05.922 --> 07:34:12.003
And it would take parents an hour and a half to get to the schools from work and another 40 minutes to drive home.

07:34:13.322 --> 07:34:21.911
This is also impractical that no child from our neighborhood has attended the school district since 1985, 33 years.

07:34:23.753 --> 07:34:30.019
In contrast, the Portola Valley and Sequoia Union schools are only nine miles away in the same direction as our commutes.

07:34:30.940 --> 07:34:34.183
Our children would spend less than half the time traveling to school.

07:34:35.106 --> 07:34:48.311
Not only could our children participate in after-school programs and socialize with classmates, many of whom live in our Skylanda community, but parents could attend school functions and volunteer.

07:34:49.671 --> 07:34:52.432
And in emergencies, we'd be an hour closer to our children.

07:34:53.833 --> 07:34:56.934
Inter-district transfers are not a viable solution.

07:34:57.734 --> 07:35:01.876
The nearby districts all have policies prohibiting most transfers.

07:35:03.285 --> 07:35:10.748
Portola Valley denied our first application and a divided County Board of Education overturned on appeal.

07:35:12.028 --> 07:35:22.652
Further, the districts require students to reapply annually, subjecting families to the uncertainties and stress of local school board politics and county politics.

07:35:23.812 --> 07:35:29.054
And if a reapplication is denied, the child would be uprooted and forced to switch schools midstream.

07:35:30.148 --> 07:35:37.530
We're all strongly committed to public education, but it just isn't feasible for our children to attend La Honda Pescadero.

07:35:38.390 --> 07:35:49.314
So six years ago, we petitioned the San Mateo County Committee to transfer our 10 homes and our four children to Portola Valley and, excuse me,

07:35:50.134 --> 07:35:50.914
Sequoia Union.

07:35:51.695 --> 07:36:00.880
The County Committee unanimously approved our petition, finding it met all of the Education Code requirements and was in the best interest of our children.

07:36:01.900 --> 07:36:04.441
The CDE reaches the same conclusion.

07:36:06.062 --> 07:36:13.326
My attorney, Chris Skinnell, will address those requirements in La Honda Pescadero's appeal, but please don't lose sight of the main point.

07:36:14.775 --> 07:36:26.911
It simply isn't just or fair to make our children spend two hours a day traveling to school when there are public schools less than half the distance and which the children of our closest neighbors already attend.

07:36:27.892 --> 07:36:28.193
Thank you.

07:36:33.817 --> 07:36:35.118
Good afternoon members of the board.

07:36:35.358 --> 07:36:39.360
My name is Chris Sconell and I represent obviously the petitioners in this appeal.

07:36:40.481 --> 07:36:48.606
Before addressing the legal criteria issue in the appeal, I want to reiterate just several crucial facts that I think underlie the entire point.

07:36:49.747 --> 07:36:55.233
First, this is a very small area, only ten homes affected and no prospect of future development.

07:36:55.933 --> 07:37:08.127
Second, only four kids live there and only one is currently of school age and none of them are attending the schools or have done so in the last 30 years and there's no reason to think that any students from this area will do so in the future.

07:37:09.849 --> 07:37:22.837
Next, obviously, the key point that Mr. Ellis made is the distance that would be required for any of these students to attend when they could be going to schools that are much closer and in the direction of their work.

07:37:23.737 --> 07:37:31.983
And fifth, I want to stress, as he has, that the county committee reviewed this closely and unanimously found that all of the criteria were met and that this was

07:37:32.503 --> 07:37:35.664
a good proposal and that the transfer should be allowed.

07:37:36.944 --> 07:37:42.966
And so turning briefly to the education code provisions that the Lajonda-Pescadero School District is focused on.

07:37:43.746 --> 07:37:46.587
First, criterion number one, the number of pupils.

07:37:46.807 --> 07:37:50.008
Well, there aren't any pupils that are attending Lajonda-Pescadero.

07:37:50.048 --> 07:37:56.530
So as the CDE staff found, there's no effect of this transfer on that criterion.

07:37:57.490 --> 07:38:06.517
Regarding this community interest criterion number two, these houses are in the same skylawn community, most of which is already in the Portala Valley School District.

07:38:06.617 --> 07:38:15.443
And so this would be uniting a community that already exists and where everybody socializes and works and dines and recreates together.

07:38:18.380 --> 07:38:30.396
Regarding condition number four, the question of racial isolation, frankly, we think this is a bit of a red herring given the fact that no students are attending the La Honda Pescadero School.

07:38:30.436 --> 07:38:32.780
And so again, there's not going to be any impact

07:38:33.260 --> 07:38:35.444
on this criterion from approving the proposal.

07:38:36.345 --> 07:38:44.217
And also, as the staff report here notes, the picture of this effect is really overstated in any respect.

07:38:45.599 --> 07:38:48.142
The elementary schools is actually

07:38:49.785 --> 07:38:53.269
It actually has the opposite effect when you move to the Portola Valley schools.

07:38:53.649 --> 07:38:56.713
The middle schools, yes, there is more of a transfer of minority students.

07:38:57.354 --> 07:38:59.176
But then in high schools, it's all about the same.

07:38:59.216 --> 07:39:06.805
And so there is not a clear cut move one direction or the other in the racial makeup, even accounting for the fact that no students are attending.

07:39:08.627 --> 07:39:11.369
As for condition number eight, the question of property values.

07:39:12.370 --> 07:39:18.855
First of all, there's no evidence at all, again, that this is done primarily for the purpose of increasing property values.

07:39:19.375 --> 07:39:25.720
But I want to make an additional point, which is there's no reason to think this is actually going to improve property values for these homes at all.

07:39:26.221 --> 07:39:31.565
The fact is that we went back and looked at a number of appraisals that were done on these houses in the last few years.

07:39:31.625 --> 07:39:34.407
Then we have about nine of them for six different houses.

07:39:34.967 --> 07:39:39.149
And most of the comparables in those appraisals are already in the Portola Valley School District.

07:39:39.950 --> 07:39:43.232
Very, very, very few are in the La Honda Pescadero School District at all.

07:39:43.332 --> 07:39:51.436
So to the extent there's an impact on property values of being in one or the other, that effect is really already baked in to the values of these homes already.

07:39:51.856 --> 07:39:58.440
And so moving the line is really not going to, there's no reason to think that it's going to affect those property values at all.

07:40:00.526 --> 07:40:11.073
And then finally, with respect to the fiscal management piece, La Honda Pescadero's appeal claims that this proposal would have real and considerable financial impact on the district.

07:40:11.713 --> 07:40:16.496
But the county committee and CDE both concluded that it would have an insignificant effect and we agree.

07:40:17.697 --> 07:40:22.780
The original petition showed that La Honda Pescadero was one of the best funded districts in the county and state.

07:40:23.200 --> 07:40:27.003
And in the six years since, the district's finances have only improved.

07:40:28.175 --> 07:40:37.583
The parcels that are going to be transferred now contribute $34,000 of property tax to La Honda Pescadero representing a negligible 0.6% of the total revenue.

07:40:38.703 --> 07:40:43.387
As a community funded or basic aid district, La Honda Pescadero is among the best funded in the state.

07:40:43.667 --> 07:40:45.889
Just 12% of all districts are community funded.

07:40:46.810 --> 07:40:53.155
The district's total revenue and revenue per student have continued to grow steadily with revenue per student increasing 26% from 2011 to 2016.

07:40:57.461 --> 07:41:05.067
Of the 23 stool districts in San Mateo County, La Honda Pescadero ranks fourth in revenue per student with 49% more than the median.

07:41:05.548 --> 07:41:08.130
It has the third best teacher-student ratio of 37% better than the median.

07:41:10.552 --> 07:41:16.737
Moody's Investor Service believes the district is financially healthy and rated the district's bonds A1, the median for all U.S.

07:41:16.757 --> 07:41:17.397
school districts.

07:41:18.058 --> 07:41:30.507
And in 2018, Moody said that the credit position for La Honda Pescadero is favorable with a healthy financial position, a modestly sized tax base with strong socioeconomic profile, and mid-range debt and pension burdens.

07:41:31.247 --> 07:41:34.028
So, in other words, the district is in good financial shape.

07:41:34.488 --> 07:41:47.490
And even beyond that, there are two key arguments that the district makes here that we believe are not accurately presented or certainly don't accurately represent the facts on the ground today as you consider this.

07:41:48.551 --> 07:41:55.852
The first is that the district claimed that it owed $2 million to the county in 2019 to pay off an emergency loan.

07:41:56.468 --> 07:41:58.713
after it mismanaged a bond construction project.

07:41:59.234 --> 07:42:05.507
And it said that the district was currently engaged in costly litigation to recover damages from the project manager and several contractors.

07:42:06.900 --> 07:42:13.726
Second, relatedly, the appeal claimed that La Honda Pescadero would be unable to pay off the loan to the county in 2019 without a future sale of bonds.

07:42:14.847 --> 07:42:26.898
And what's missing from the staff report, and I think this is because facts haven't been updated, is the fact that the litigation that was talked about was actually settled in 2012 before the appeal was even filed.

07:42:28.079 --> 07:42:38.987
And the county committee was, I'm sorry, the bonds that were, the loans that were being talked about for the county were paid off in 2014 using the funds from that settlement.

07:42:39.428 --> 07:42:46.753
So that concern about being unable to pay the county this loan in 2019 have evaporated because that loan has been paid off.

07:42:48.976 --> 07:43:03.693
Additionally, the county, while its assessed value was very near the limit back in 2012 when this was, the appeal was filed, because of property, good fiscal management and property valuation increase,

07:43:04.674 --> 07:43:14.204
The district's assessed value has now, instead of being close to the $60 limit, is now down approximately 44 percent, I'm sorry, $44 per $100,000 of assessed value.

07:43:14.224 --> 07:43:15.906
So much more room for bonds and that's even after they issued

07:43:21.852 --> 07:43:24.273
approximately $4 million in bonds in 2016.

07:43:24.333 --> 07:43:37.457
So long story short, the district is doing fine financially and is in fact in much better condition now than it was in 2012 when the County Committee concluded that this was not a reason to prevent the transfer.

07:43:39.271 --> 07:43:41.795
Finally, I want to address the area of election briefly.

07:43:42.996 --> 07:43:54.772
In the past 15 years of transfer appeals, the State Board of Education has consistently set the area of election to just the territory being transferred, which is the default under the Education Code.

07:43:55.773 --> 07:44:01.738
And here, too, the CDE recommends that the area of election be set to just the territory being transferred.

07:44:02.599 --> 07:44:12.847
They found that the transfer, quote, would have no significant effect on the voters in either the remaining Lohanda-Pescadero USD or the receiving Portola Valley ESD and Sequoia UHSD.

07:44:13.687 --> 07:44:16.550
We obviously support the CDE's recommendation.

07:44:17.530 --> 07:44:30.474
And one thing I want to try to clarify just a little bit is it may sound a little bit academic because the statutes require the expansion of the election area anyway in the event that the district opposes it because of its size.

07:44:31.535 --> 07:44:44.859
But in fact, if you do agree with the CDE's proposal, that leaves the door open for potential discussions with the district about withdrawing its opposition in which case the election area would shrink back to the default area.

07:44:45.479 --> 07:44:48.141
So if they maintain their opposition, then it's going to be bigger anyway.

07:44:48.922 --> 07:44:55.286
But if they withdraw it, if their concerns are eventually ameliorated, that would allow for a much smaller election area.

07:44:55.766 --> 07:45:00.390
And it would save them money, it would save everybody more trouble, and it would allow it to be shrunk at that point.

07:45:02.311 --> 07:45:05.734
Ultimately, this proposed transfer boils down to a fundamental question of fairness.

07:45:06.694 --> 07:45:16.377
Are the families in this affected area going to be allowed to participate in the promise of a public education like other families, which this transfer would facilitate with minimal impact on Lujan de Pescadero?

07:45:17.157 --> 07:45:24.839
Or are they going to continue to be forced out of the public school system by the sheer impossibility of attending the public schools to which they're assigned?

07:45:25.579 --> 07:45:25.879
Thank you.

07:45:27.520 --> 07:45:34.982
Okay, that concludes the comments and now we'll hear 15 minutes for the opponents.

07:45:37.847 --> 07:45:40.009
15 because we have two petitions together.

07:45:42.651 --> 07:45:44.393
I promise I won't use all 15 minutes.

07:45:46.954 --> 07:45:54.360
Thank you, State Board of Education, Superintendent Torlakson, Board President Kirst for hearing from me today.

07:45:54.921 --> 07:45:55.961
My name is Amy Williver.

07:45:56.041 --> 07:45:58.964
I'm the superintendent of La Honda Pescadero Unified School District.

07:45:59.484 --> 07:46:06.910
I have worked in the district since 1991, serving as a teacher, a principal, and have spent eight years as superintendent.

07:46:08.897 --> 07:46:19.964
I am here today to address the Lohanda Pescadero Appeal of the County Committee's decision to remove 35 parcels, 10 homes and additional parcels from Lohanda Pescadero to Portola Valley.

07:46:20.685 --> 07:46:31.852
And I speak on behalf of the approximately 325 students and associated staff members who support and attend three tiny schools on the south coast of San Mateo County.

07:46:32.892 --> 07:46:38.056
We are the smallest district in our county, yet we cover the largest geographical area

07:46:40.273 --> 07:46:44.236
We are an unusual district for a mostly suburban community.

07:46:44.977 --> 07:46:52.762
We stretch from the Redwoods along the ridgeline down to the ocean, all the way to Santa Cruz border at Anya Nuevo there.

07:46:54.404 --> 07:47:01.229
We have ag-based coastal areas in Pescadero and San Gregorio and the Redwood mountain towns of La Honda and Loma Mar.

07:47:02.550 --> 07:47:04.271
We are entirely unincorporated.

07:47:05.089 --> 07:47:09.751
And we have no local government or municipal government or advocacy.

07:47:10.672 --> 07:47:14.074
We are socioeconomically and linguistically and culturally diverse.

07:47:15.214 --> 07:47:24.759
Our residents are connected not by parks, playgrounds, library supermarkets or movie theaters, for we have none of those in our district, but by our schools.

07:47:25.700 --> 07:47:27.401
Our schools serve as our glue.

07:47:27.961 --> 07:47:32.443
It is where we gather, we sing, we exercise, we eat, we learn and play.

07:47:32.763 --> 07:47:33.924
And we are a proud district.

07:47:35.891 --> 07:47:42.520
I really appreciate the work of the CDE staff to put together such a thorough analysis of the boundary transfer petition and appeal.

07:47:43.060 --> 07:47:51.992
I'm not here to repeat the facts stated in my district's appeal of the county committee's decision, and I'm not here to argue with the information presented by the petitioners and his attorney.

07:47:52.973 --> 07:47:54.594
I am here for a couple of reasons.

07:47:54.974 --> 07:47:57.355
I'm here to clarify a few points regarding the appeal.

07:47:58.056 --> 07:48:09.921
I am also here to put this boundary transfer in the context of a small, underpowered rural district, which is surrounded by suburban and urban areas accustomed to the conveniences of life, what we call over the hill.

07:48:11.782 --> 07:48:12.582
It's literally a hill.

07:48:15.064 --> 07:48:19.346
And to show that in context of Lohana Pescadero's viability,

07:48:20.646 --> 07:48:24.651
The whole can be greater than the sum of its many parts.

07:48:25.071 --> 07:48:31.438
And satisfying the nine conditions, the parts, does not necessarily support the whole, which is the health of our district.

07:48:32.458 --> 07:48:36.000
On the points of appeal, I will address the following quickly.

07:48:36.540 --> 07:48:38.381
Conditions 8, 9 and the area of election.

07:48:39.222 --> 07:48:41.443
Condition 8, the interaction of property tax values.

07:48:41.483 --> 07:48:44.985
Yes, we did not spend the money to do a study of the property tax increases.

07:48:45.245 --> 07:48:46.766
We were offered, but we didn't do it.

07:48:47.606 --> 07:48:52.889
I do affirm the district position that the transfer of these properties will likely increase petitioner property values.

07:48:52.929 --> 07:48:56.071
For Patola Valley is one of the most wealthy zip codes in America.

07:48:58.204 --> 07:49:07.238
While I realize that these parcels will not assume a Portola Valley zip code, we do know the impact of high-quality schools on property tax values.

07:49:08.060 --> 07:49:12.466
And Portola Valley certainly outperforms on our state testing, La Honda Pescadero.

07:49:13.783 --> 07:49:17.444
Condition 9, the promotion of sound fiscal management and no negative impact.

07:49:18.004 --> 07:49:25.026
The continued chipping away of our district in the past, present, and future is a serious concern to La Honda Pescadero.

07:49:25.386 --> 07:49:34.589
While $30,000, $10,000, $40,000 at a time may not seem like great sums and may not trigger a significant impact, the cumulative effect

07:49:36.360 --> 07:49:37.101
is a problem.

07:49:37.782 --> 07:49:40.885
And this precedent leaves other areas of our district at risk.

07:49:41.225 --> 07:49:46.410
We border four different districts and our boundaries are wide and large.

07:49:48.592 --> 07:49:56.660
One by one, property transfers may not have that large effect, but over time we are seeing an impact.

07:49:58.806 --> 07:50:01.627
and the setting of the election area, as I know we've already been discussing.

07:50:01.967 --> 07:50:08.910
After many meetings and discussions, the County Committee set the area of election should the district continue to oppose the petition to the entire district boundary.

07:50:09.550 --> 07:50:16.133
The CDE staff rejects this decision by the County Committee and recommends today that the election be set in the area of the affected parcels.

07:50:16.953 --> 07:50:25.837
I understand and I think it's already been explained that we have the option to expand it, but I wonder why uphold some local decisions by the County Committee but reject others.

07:50:27.321 --> 07:50:33.806
My second reason for coming today, placing this petition in the context of the whole, our district's viability as a rural district.

07:50:34.507 --> 07:50:43.174
Only months prior to receiving this petition, La Honda Pescadero lost a similar petition in a nearby area by a decision of the same county committee.

07:50:44.135 --> 07:50:45.696
Circumstances were a little bit different.

07:50:47.472 --> 07:50:54.898
We didn't know this second petition was coming, and we decided that it was not in our best interest to appeal due to the limited infrastructure we have in our district.

07:50:54.978 --> 07:50:56.699
As you might notice, I'm here without a team.

07:50:56.839 --> 07:50:59.381
I'm here without an attorney, and I'm a part-time superintendent.

07:51:00.422 --> 07:51:16.374
Located in a beautiful landscape, we also continue to lose property tax revenue as a powerful local open space trust fueled by Silicon Valley donors purchase large swaths of land and then qualifies them for welfare exemptions, thus removing them from our tax rolls.

07:51:17.074 --> 07:51:24.059
Peninsula Open Space, POST, is our biggest landowner and pays a fraction of the taxes a private landowner would pay.

07:51:24.579 --> 07:51:35.447
Between 1997 and 2014, when we last calculated, POST had removed and or impacted the tax base of 18% of our assessed valuation.

07:51:36.388 --> 07:51:40.811
That has only accelerated as more purchases have accumulated over the past four years.

07:51:42.361 --> 07:51:46.684
So our AV does not increase at the pace of our county.

07:51:47.864 --> 07:51:56.269
In 2017 our growth was about 73% of the rest of the county and this past year was 59% being the lowest increase in AV in our county.

07:51:57.330 --> 07:52:01.973
We're basic aid, we rely on those increases to fund ongoing cost increases.

07:52:03.328 --> 07:52:06.751
The whole, what it's like to be a rural district in a wealthy suburban county?

07:52:07.492 --> 07:52:09.473
Being rural brings joys and sorrows.

07:52:09.854 --> 07:52:16.760
Silicon Valley residents flock to our small towns over the weekend for ecotourism, ag tourism, goat farms, and berry picking.

07:52:17.180 --> 07:52:21.564
While at the same time, our deep infrastructure issues are out of context with the rest of the Bay Area.

07:52:21.984 --> 07:52:24.006
Our schools struggle for clean water.

07:52:24.687 --> 07:52:27.729
Our families struggle for warm, affordable housing and services.

07:52:28.690 --> 07:52:34.213
Local agencies making decisions which affect us lack this context and understanding of rural life.

07:52:34.834 --> 07:52:37.255
We are misunderstood in our local context.

07:52:37.535 --> 07:52:44.339
We travel long distances to attend non-district events through roads which must withstand the fury of nature.

07:52:44.359 --> 07:52:46.260
I don't want to get into our roads.

07:52:46.920 --> 07:52:49.522
Our kids bus long distances back and forth to school.

07:52:49.942 --> 07:52:52.984
We have to plan trips over the hill for doctors, dentists, and groceries.

07:52:53.444 --> 07:52:55.965
My boardroom is a mobile dental clinic.

07:52:57.066 --> 07:53:02.489
four to eight days of the month because we're the only building in our community that has double doors to let the equipment in.

07:53:03.470 --> 07:53:04.551
That is our context.

07:53:05.711 --> 07:53:14.337
So a committee decision willing to change district boundaries so families have a more convenient drive when their local elementary school is seven or eight minutes.

07:53:15.382 --> 07:53:21.345
away and closer than the desired school of attendance, as is our bus stop for middle and high school students.

07:53:21.385 --> 07:53:23.206
And we do run early and late buses.

07:53:24.367 --> 07:53:28.389
Makes it clear to me that I will be back here again, which is reason number three.

07:53:29.129 --> 07:53:35.853
I'm lastly here so that you can get to know me because this transfer of property only moves our boundary to new areas, subdivisions and neighbors.

07:53:37.074 --> 07:53:43.517
We share boundaries with four districts that will always be new neighbors of ours to claim that they are now the farthest away and do a boundary change.

07:53:45.185 --> 07:54:00.817
However, while I respect the work of the CDC staff to prepare such a thoughtful staff report, the context in which this recommendation is being made, with the many conditions and lists being checked, does not take into account the whole picture of a district that does not fit into the context of its surrounding neighbors.

07:54:01.417 --> 07:54:07.582
I stand here as a public worker, a longtime small town superintendent watching the Bay Area change around her.

07:54:08.243 --> 07:54:13.587
A Bay Area that takes what they want from the Lohanda and Pescadero communities, but leaves behind what's inconvenient.

07:54:14.227 --> 07:54:20.812
This is the opportunity for you, members of the State Board, to right the wrong and apply a broader perspective.

07:54:21.273 --> 07:54:26.377
You see, you work with more districts and you see all sorts of different types of districts.

07:54:26.697 --> 07:54:29.439
And I ask you to bring that perspective to this decision.

07:54:29.759 --> 07:54:30.100
Thank you.

07:54:33.843 --> 07:54:38.006
That concludes that portion of the public hearing of the pro and con.

07:54:39.087 --> 07:54:40.748
Now we'll move to public comment.

07:54:41.846 --> 07:54:42.788
There's one speaker.

07:54:42.909 --> 07:54:44.613
Would Tim Fox come to the podium?

07:54:49.935 --> 07:54:51.935
I got to say good afternoon, now I'll say good evening.

07:54:52.375 --> 07:54:53.376
My name is Tim Fox.

07:54:53.456 --> 07:54:54.496
I'm a Deputy County Counsel.

07:54:54.536 --> 07:54:55.676
I represent the County Committee.

07:54:56.056 --> 07:54:59.097
The position of the County Committee was to support the petition.

07:54:59.777 --> 07:55:02.037
The only thing I'm going to speak on is the election area.

07:55:02.177 --> 07:55:05.258
I imagine that you all are a bit confused about why we did what we did.

07:55:05.758 --> 07:55:07.518
And I'll be quite honest, it wasn't my idea.

07:55:07.898 --> 07:55:15.640
The committee themselves decided they wanted to set the election area because they knew about the statute, they knew about what Mr. Shirey was talking about, and they knew what it provided.

07:55:16.400 --> 07:55:18.782
they simply wanted the superintendent to pay for the election.

07:55:19.102 --> 07:55:30.871
My take on why they did what they did was they know Amy Wolliver, they know the La Honda Pescadero School District, and they decided that if there was going to be an election, it should be at the cost of the county superintendent and not at the cost of the school district.

07:55:31.231 --> 07:55:34.774
And if that's still confusing to you, that tells me that you haven't been to Pescadero.

07:55:35.394 --> 07:55:39.917
So I believe that the decision of the committee should be upheld in its entirety.

07:55:40.117 --> 07:55:44.980
I understand it's somewhat unusual for the State Board to set an election area.

07:55:45.721 --> 07:55:48.162
And I know the statute operates as a backup to this position.

07:55:48.563 --> 07:55:51.825
But I also know that there will be an argument made by the Chief Petitioner

07:55:52.305 --> 07:55:56.087
that the district should just capitulate rather than bear the cost of the election.

07:55:56.447 --> 07:55:58.848
And I think that's why the county committee decided to do what it did.

07:55:59.208 --> 07:56:06.031
That it wanted to say that this should be a decision of the Ohana Pescadero school community and that it was unfair to make them pay for an election for it.

07:56:06.131 --> 07:56:06.972
That's why it should be upheld.

07:56:07.012 --> 07:56:07.272
Time.

07:56:07.392 --> 07:56:07.912
It's a piety.

07:56:08.112 --> 07:56:08.432
Thank you.

07:56:10.693 --> 07:56:11.094
Okay.

07:56:12.074 --> 07:56:15.896
That concludes that testimony and we have Larry back.

07:56:18.200 --> 07:56:23.463
I think, I think we need some comments from our liaison, Bruce Holliday.

07:56:24.104 --> 07:56:30.267
And could you, in your terms, put how these, are we going to vote on these?

07:56:30.487 --> 07:56:31.908
We're going to vote separately.

07:56:33.169 --> 07:56:36.691
It was a combined hearing, but we need two separate motions.

07:56:36.951 --> 07:56:37.612
Is that right?

07:56:38.132 --> 07:56:38.312
Right.

07:56:39.152 --> 07:56:39.533
Okay.

07:56:40.693 --> 07:56:41.754
We need one.

07:56:42.404 --> 07:56:46.807
One motion on the La Honda Pescadero, the district appeal.

07:56:47.327 --> 07:56:52.091
That's either to affirm the action of the county committee and set the election area.

07:56:52.811 --> 07:57:06.160
And then once that's done, the recommendation, since you don't really need to deal with the second appeal, you've already dealt with the issues of the second appeal, is to summarily deny review of that appeal.

07:57:07.532 --> 07:57:07.833
Okay.

07:57:07.873 --> 07:57:20.909
So the first motion would decide both issues, the transfer of property and the motion would also include the election of boundary in that first motion.

07:57:21.190 --> 07:57:21.570
Right.

07:57:21.690 --> 07:57:22.411
Or simply put.

07:57:22.972 --> 07:57:25.474
the motion to support the staff recommendation.

07:57:25.614 --> 07:57:26.354
Okay.

07:57:26.594 --> 07:57:28.996
Just, sorry, just to clarify.

07:57:29.376 --> 07:57:30.837
Of the staff recommendation.

07:57:30.997 --> 07:57:32.898
Sorry, just to clarify from council table.

07:57:34.039 --> 07:57:38.302
The item five and item six are both as to the same underlying petition.

07:57:38.742 --> 07:57:43.866
So the board's vote on item five makes essentially item six the other appeal moot.

07:57:44.326 --> 07:57:47.388
And so that's the recommendation is six is to summarily deny.

07:57:47.888 --> 07:57:58.964
Another way of doing it is to, should the board ultimately, their motion to support the CD recommendation as to both, just move the CD recommendation as to both items since they've both been called jointly together.

07:57:59.125 --> 07:58:04.012
So, however the board wishes to frame the motion, we can ensure it's clear and everyone understands what they're voting on.

07:58:05.640 --> 07:58:06.401
Okay.

07:58:06.641 --> 07:58:15.846
And so before I call on Bruce, I'm going to make some comments on the election district, since I've had really extensive experience of this.

07:58:16.547 --> 07:58:25.772
We did most of Orange County in the 70s, which was a maze of school districts cut up by freeways.

07:58:25.913 --> 07:58:30.916
And it was really huge numbers of people involved in these things.

07:58:31.716 --> 07:58:33.517
So we heard many of these.

07:58:33.837 --> 07:58:35.157
And I'm not recommending this.

07:58:35.237 --> 07:58:40.099
I'm just saying what was done by the board at that time.

07:58:40.299 --> 07:58:41.360
Not that we were right.

07:58:41.380 --> 07:58:43.701
But I want to present our reasoning.

07:58:45.842 --> 07:58:57.126
Once we decided, you know, there may have been exceptions, but generally once we decided what we wanted to do, meaning how we wanted the boundaries to be set,

07:58:58.510 --> 07:59:08.578
then we thought about the election in terms of how would the election get what the board wanted when it decided on the boundaries.

07:59:09.219 --> 07:59:12.842
So in effect, the election was not a separate decision.

07:59:13.082 --> 07:59:20.528
It was a derivative of if you want the property transfer, then you want an election that is most likely to bring that about.

07:59:21.308 --> 07:59:21.969
And so we

07:59:24.053 --> 07:59:26.095
And we are able to make that decision.

07:59:26.155 --> 07:59:30.639
We have the authority to do that.

07:59:30.740 --> 07:59:42.471
So that was generally the practice that the election was determined by the result that we reached.

07:59:42.904 --> 07:59:46.205
in terms of the boundary transfer at that point.

07:59:46.845 --> 07:59:50.106
So, the two could be considered.

07:59:50.326 --> 08:00:01.428
And so, the criteria would be for the election, which election boundaries will bring about the result the board wanted in terms of the transfer of property.

08:00:01.869 --> 08:00:06.650
It was a derivative decision rather than it's an independent thing with a whole big debate about it.

08:00:07.530 --> 08:00:10.051
So, that's all I'll say about the past.

08:00:10.131 --> 08:00:11.811
So, Board Member Holliday.

08:00:13.627 --> 08:00:24.038
Larry this County Commission that heard the Ravenswood Appeal is the same County Commission that heard this one, correct, right?

08:00:24.638 --> 08:00:36.210
So they had they The same people had to have the same experience over the years with all these various transfers

08:00:37.665 --> 08:00:49.052
Which is, I think, something to think about in the sense that they understand about the importance of racial integration.

08:00:49.093 --> 08:00:50.453
They understand about...

08:00:53.345 --> 08:00:57.429
all of the factors that we talked about for the last hour and a half or whatever, right?

08:00:57.949 --> 08:00:58.890
They think about all these things.

08:00:58.970 --> 08:01:07.920
But in this case, they did say, nah, it just makes sense that these 10 homes make the transfer.

08:01:08.931 --> 08:01:13.354
So I feel, I love Pescadero.

08:01:14.235 --> 08:01:16.636
And I hope that it's not just my ecotourism.

08:01:16.676 --> 08:01:23.761
I actually drive an hour and a half to bring my dogs to a vet there because the vet is so wonderful.

08:01:25.122 --> 08:01:34.729
And I do think that it's a community that needs tons of support and not just gawking tourists.

08:01:36.898 --> 08:01:43.001
I hope that there are good things coming down the road for Pescadero.

08:01:43.682 --> 08:01:51.626
But this notion of over the hill, because I used to work on the coastal side and I know what over the hill means.

08:01:52.566 --> 08:01:54.887
This group of homes is at the top of the hill.

08:01:56.208 --> 08:01:57.769
You couldn't be closer to over the hill.

08:01:59.190 --> 08:02:00.970
They are pretty much basically over the hill.

08:02:03.098 --> 08:02:06.280
I do support the CDE recommendation.

08:02:07.140 --> 08:02:10.942
I don't think it's going to be a domino effect as we talked about in the last one.

08:02:11.342 --> 08:02:12.503
I certainly would hope not.

08:02:12.943 --> 08:02:16.445
I would like to go on record saying that future boards don't do that.

08:02:17.445 --> 08:02:19.726
But I think this is an isolated case.

08:02:19.786 --> 08:02:21.107
I hope it's an isolated case.

08:02:21.167 --> 08:02:22.808
I feel it is an isolated case.

08:02:23.248 --> 08:02:26.930
And so I would move to support the CDE recommendation in this case.

08:02:31.363 --> 08:02:34.205
Yeah, you drove there every day, right, for your job?

08:02:36.486 --> 08:02:43.031
No, but over, you drove from Oakland over to, so you have some feel for this.

08:02:43.471 --> 08:02:50.195
Just a point of clarification on the motion, is it as to both item five and six, member Holliday, or just as to item five that you're moving the CD recommendation?

08:02:53.457 --> 08:03:00.542
I thought we were doing, I thought we were going to vote CD, I'm moving CD recommendation for item five, period.

08:03:03.607 --> 08:03:07.130
Okay, is there further board discussion of this?

08:03:08.911 --> 08:03:09.612
Board Member Burr.

08:03:11.974 --> 08:03:14.275
Are both of the districts basic aid?

08:03:15.496 --> 08:03:15.676
Yes.

08:03:16.057 --> 08:03:16.237
Okay.

08:03:17.741 --> 08:03:24.826
Then the question, I guess I'm a little troubled by the election area or I don't really understand what's happening with the election area.

08:03:25.227 --> 08:03:33.614
Your recommendation is that the election area, and I assume this was the county as well, be limited to these 10 or 25, 10 homes or... Correct.

08:03:36.656 --> 08:03:36.876
Right.

08:03:38.217 --> 08:03:45.583
So to your point earlier, President Kirst, I could argue that for democratic purposes, we should let the whole district vote.

08:03:46.164 --> 08:03:48.205
I mean, it has it impacts the entire district.

08:03:48.245 --> 08:03:57.953
And I'm I just want to say I'm very compelled by what the superintendent had to say about this district and feeling a little bit like board member Strauss did on the last one.

08:03:58.753 --> 08:04:11.618
That it's it's a really tough call So but I thought I also understood you say that if the district objects to this little tiny election area of ten homes Then it would have to expand to the entire district.

08:04:11.678 --> 08:04:12.558
How does that work?

08:04:12.598 --> 08:04:14.499
Could you just explain that a little bit more?

08:04:15.719 --> 08:04:25.463
right if if the state board expands the election area to the to the entire La Honda Pescadero Unified School District

08:04:26.052 --> 08:04:32.898
the order that will go down to the county superintendent is call an election in that area.

08:04:33.518 --> 08:04:39.023
And then that will be the election that the county will have fiscal responsibility for.

08:04:40.224 --> 08:04:50.052
If the board chooses to limit the election area, it will again send that order down to the county superintendent.

08:04:50.652 --> 08:04:54.095
And the county superintendent will then have to not only take into account

08:04:54.929 --> 08:04:58.250
the state board's order, but also what statute states.

08:04:59.011 --> 08:05:11.295
So the state board orders the election area in this area, but statute, if the district maintains its opposition, statute requires that the county superintendent expand the election area to the whole district.

08:05:12.836 --> 08:05:16.157
And that expansion, that expanded part will be a cost to the district.

08:05:22.342 --> 08:05:23.989
Because I thought there was some other.

08:05:24.110 --> 08:05:26.461
If that's what you want, you expand the election area.

08:05:32.631 --> 08:05:32.951
Yeah.

08:05:35.072 --> 08:05:40.935
I appreciate the board members saying, you know, giving another reason and another way of looking at it.

08:05:40.955 --> 08:05:42.636
I really think that's appropriate.

08:05:43.897 --> 08:05:52.941
But the board must think that if it really wants this property transfer, you're at risk losing what you want by opening up the election area.

08:05:53.201 --> 08:05:56.463
So you have, you take a risk if it goes to the,

08:05:57.003 --> 08:06:04.609
Typically, if it went back to the districts that were losing the property, those districts turned down the reorganizations.

08:06:05.169 --> 08:06:15.997
And therefore, you didn't get what you thought was the right policy because you set the election in a way that made it unlikely that it would succeed.

08:06:17.419 --> 08:06:17.899
Board member.

08:06:20.089 --> 08:06:38.306
Well, first of all, let me say to the superintendent who came from the school district that's on the other side of the county's decision, I really appreciate the fact that you actually made a very compelling argument for the harm that this decision will cause your district.

08:06:38.966 --> 08:06:43.250
And I understand it and I absolutely agree with everything that you said.

08:06:44.051 --> 08:06:56.498
But I'm also listening to the families in those 10 houses of those four children who actually physically seem to live closer to a school that they could get to.

08:06:56.618 --> 08:07:08.724
Having lived in the Bay Area for a while, I understand that what you look at on the map and the line looks like this, that represents a significant amount of time sitting on the road for children that young to commute.

08:07:09.225 --> 08:07:13.147
And so that also is a compelling interest for that community.

08:07:13.627 --> 08:07:21.595
So weighing two very clear compelling interests, that's where the difficulty is here in making this decision.

08:07:22.076 --> 08:07:30.945
But that was related to what I asked Larry to try to explain to us on the previous item to give me an idea of what a compelling reason would be.

08:07:32.594 --> 08:07:51.779
The reason why I'm supporting this motion today is because in the interest of those very young children and the commute that would be required of them, while there is a clear compelling issue about the impact on the district, there is also a very clear and compelling concern about the impact on those very young children.

08:07:52.179 --> 08:08:00.081
So I really appreciate both sides, not only what you did in choosing not to politicize this, but to look at the very practical reasons

08:08:00.501 --> 08:08:02.426
for making a very practical decision.

08:08:02.486 --> 08:08:05.753
I appreciate what both sides attempted to do for this hearing.

08:08:05.773 --> 08:08:07.397
So I just wanted to make sure that was said.

08:08:07.417 --> 08:08:09.402
Board Member Strauss.

08:08:10.075 --> 08:08:14.916
Larry, I know it's complicated and you've been great, so I just need a review and clarification.

08:08:15.376 --> 08:08:26.338
So let's say that the board supports the CDE recommendation and the decision is that the vote is to be taken by the area of the 10 houses.

08:08:26.918 --> 08:08:28.058
It goes back to the county.

08:08:28.578 --> 08:08:39.300
Did you say that the district then could challenge it and still do a district, the whole Lejando Pescadero election, even though we said only the small houses?

08:08:39.580 --> 08:08:40.702
Yeah, I would alter that.

08:08:40.742 --> 08:08:43.025
The district doesn't challenge what you did.

08:08:43.526 --> 08:08:47.152
It's simply because it's on record opposing the transfer.

08:08:47.733 --> 08:08:52.159
That's what the education code states, that any district under

08:08:53.689 --> 08:09:10.320
a certain level, which this district under 900 students, 980 ADA or lower, if they oppose it, if they oppose a transfer out of their district, then that by operation of law expands the election area to the entire district.

08:09:11.121 --> 08:09:15.384
So it's not that they're challenging the board's decision.

08:09:15.484 --> 08:09:22.048
It's just that they're opposing the territory transfer and that opposition translates into an expansion of the district.

08:09:22.383 --> 08:09:31.205
So even if we say just the small area votes to support what President Chris was saying, it still could be the large area.

08:09:31.305 --> 08:09:37.286
If the district maintains its opposition, then by statute, the election area will be expanded.

08:09:37.346 --> 08:09:49.689
The difference is that if you set the election area for just the 10 homes and the election area is expanded by operation of law, then the district has to pay

08:09:50.694 --> 08:09:54.360
for that expanded portion of the election rather than the county.

08:09:54.400 --> 08:10:00.169
The county pays for the 10 homes, rest of the district is, election is a cost to the district.

08:10:00.529 --> 08:10:05.938
If you expand the election area, then that becomes, the entire election becomes a county cost.

08:10:06.328 --> 08:10:29.370
And then if I heard the attorney who spoke representing the residents in those 10 homes, he's suggesting that if we agree with or affirm the county's position and set the election for those 10 homes, that would co-opt the superintendent out of an effort to try to oppose this and broaden or set the election to be larger.

08:10:30.131 --> 08:10:31.911
I found that a little disconcerting.

08:10:31.971 --> 08:10:33.992
I didn't like that part of the presentation.

08:10:34.492 --> 08:10:36.292
So, yeah, I understand that now.

08:10:37.513 --> 08:10:40.073
Okay, so we have a motion.

08:10:40.313 --> 08:10:42.854
Yeah, we have a motion and it's seconded.

08:10:44.734 --> 08:10:45.614
We're ready for a vote.

08:10:45.754 --> 08:10:47.235
All those in favor, raise your hands.

08:10:47.255 --> 08:10:51.216
Just for item five.

08:10:53.083 --> 08:11:03.568
Just for item five, which included all the CDE recommendation, which is to transfer the property and set the election as the ten, as the ten homes.

08:11:04.688 --> 08:11:11.751
All right.

08:11:16.293 --> 08:11:17.314
We clear on that?

08:11:17.434 --> 08:11:18.554
I mean, yes.

08:11:22.707 --> 08:11:32.555
Maybe read it out loud.

08:11:32.635 --> 08:11:34.376
You've got to get closer to that mic.

08:11:34.416 --> 08:11:35.657
Sorry, I didn't hit my button.

08:11:35.717 --> 08:11:36.157
I'm sorry.

08:11:36.298 --> 08:11:50.349
The CEE recommends that the state board affirm the action of the county committee to approve the proposal to transfer territory from the La Honda Pescadero Unified School District to the Portola Valley Elementary School District and the Sequoia Union High School District.

08:11:50.689 --> 08:11:56.732
The CDE further recommends that the State Board establish the area proposed for transfer as the election area.

08:11:58.994 --> 08:12:00.094
That's my motion.

08:12:00.375 --> 08:12:00.695
Okay.

08:12:01.235 --> 08:12:02.836
And that's the seconder's motion.

08:12:03.416 --> 08:12:03.716
Okay.

08:12:04.197 --> 08:12:04.517
All right.

08:12:04.557 --> 08:12:06.338
Now, all those in favor, raise your hands.

08:12:07.099 --> 08:12:07.419
All right.

08:12:07.599 --> 08:12:08.240
It carries.

08:12:08.580 --> 08:12:08.780
No.

08:12:09.281 --> 08:12:09.761
No.

08:12:09.841 --> 08:12:10.482
One no vote.

08:12:10.522 --> 08:12:11.743
Two no.

08:12:11.783 --> 08:12:12.203
Two no.

08:12:12.483 --> 08:12:12.764
Okay.

08:12:13.104 --> 08:12:13.564
Two no.

08:12:13.724 --> 08:12:14.225
It carries.

08:12:15.025 --> 08:12:17.667
So do we want to break before computer science?

08:12:17.768 --> 08:12:18.908
We have to go to six.

08:12:19.129 --> 08:12:19.309
Yeah.

08:12:19.349 --> 08:12:20.189
We want to go to six.

08:12:20.250 --> 08:12:20.530
True.

08:12:20.610 --> 08:12:20.830
Yeah.

08:12:21.491 --> 08:12:21.771
Okay.

08:12:21.811 --> 08:12:22.812
Now six.

08:12:22.832 --> 08:12:31.519
Summarily deny review of that petition by the chief petitioners regarding the establishment of the election area by the county committee.

08:12:33.520 --> 08:12:34.021
So moved.

08:12:34.501 --> 08:12:35.001
So moved.

08:12:35.061 --> 08:12:35.662
Is there a second?

08:12:39.134 --> 08:12:39.755
Second on that?

08:12:40.575 --> 08:12:41.315
I'll second.

08:12:41.815 --> 08:12:43.376
Okay.

08:12:43.736 --> 08:12:49.198
Public comment on this second motion and item.

08:12:51.679 --> 08:12:53.640
Yes, there isn't any public comment.

08:12:53.840 --> 08:12:54.420
It was combined.

08:12:54.560 --> 08:12:55.301
It was combined.

08:12:55.421 --> 08:12:56.961
Okay.

08:12:57.682 --> 08:12:58.042
All right.

08:12:58.962 --> 08:12:59.502
Hearing none.

08:12:59.943 --> 08:13:01.403
People, no discussion.

08:13:01.723 --> 08:13:06.165
All those in favor of Member Holiday's motion, raise your hands.

08:13:07.788 --> 08:13:08.869
Okay, that carries.

08:13:09.169 --> 08:13:10.269
Two no's.

08:13:10.349 --> 08:13:11.530
Three no's.

08:13:11.570 --> 08:13:12.170
Three no's.

08:13:12.310 --> 08:13:14.291
Okay, so that, it still carries.

08:13:15.591 --> 08:13:28.297
Okay, so we're now ready for, and we've ended the hearings and we're now ready for the computer science issues.

08:13:28.437 --> 08:13:34.200
And before we get into item seven, I understand that

08:13:35.840 --> 08:13:43.365
We have a presentation by the assembly, assembly resolution to one of our board members, Trish Williams.

08:13:44.326 --> 08:13:46.367
And so we will... I'm gonna do it together.

08:13:46.387 --> 08:13:47.628
It's in this presentation.

08:13:47.708 --> 08:13:50.390
I've incorporated it into our presentation for item seven.

08:13:50.590 --> 08:13:51.891
Oh, okay.

08:13:51.911 --> 08:13:52.731
Go ahead then.

08:13:55.193 --> 08:14:02.938
So Stephanie Gregson will present now item seven and combine that with the resolution.

08:14:04.008 --> 08:14:07.070
Yes, so good evening, members of the State Board.

08:14:07.591 --> 08:14:12.175
I'm Stephanie Gregson, and I serve as the Executive Director of the Instructional Quality Commission.

08:14:12.555 --> 08:14:17.799
I'm honored to be here today in front of you presenting the first ever California Computer Science Standards.

08:14:18.179 --> 08:14:21.822
Joining me today is Dean Reese, the Chair of the Instructional Quality Commission.

08:14:22.463 --> 08:14:27.246
This is an exciting time for California to focus on computer science education.

08:14:28.147 --> 08:14:32.730
Right now, there are over 74,000 open computing jobs in California.

08:14:33.230 --> 08:14:38.654
Our students' daily lives, as we see, are impacted by the increasing reliance of technology.

08:14:39.294 --> 08:14:50.221
So it is an advantageous time to expand the opportunities for K-12 students to learn about computer science concepts, practices, and how computer science influences our daily lives.

08:14:50.881 --> 08:14:56.465
As stated in the K-12 Computer Science Framework, in our digital age, computers are both the paint

08:14:57.085 --> 08:14:57.926
and the paintbrush.

08:14:58.366 --> 08:15:01.289
Computer science education creates the artists.

08:15:03.952 --> 08:15:15.204
Before we begin our official presentation on the California Computer Science Standards, I'd like to introduce our special guest, Ellen Green, the Legislative Director for Assembly Member Mark Berman.

08:15:23.151 --> 08:15:24.592
Thank you for the opportunity to be here.

08:15:25.533 --> 08:15:28.935
Board President Kirst, members of the board, Superintendent Torlakson.

08:15:29.556 --> 08:15:34.119
Hello, my name is Ellen Green and I'm the Legislative Director for Assemblymember Mark Berman.

08:15:34.739 --> 08:15:48.129
Last month, the legislature adopted Assemblymember Berman's Assembly Concurrent Resolution 265, which designates this month, September 2018, as California Computer Science Education Month.

08:15:48.849 --> 08:16:01.653
Given the current developments in computer science education, this resolution highlights the crucial role that computer science plays in providing students the skills they need to thrive in the 21st century economy.

08:16:02.473 --> 08:16:13.777
Assemblymember Berman looks forward to working with you to meet California's vision for ensuring that all students develop foundational knowledge and skills in computer science.

08:16:14.477 --> 08:16:27.505
I'm here today to thank the State Board of Education, the California Department of Education, and the Instructional Quality Commission for all your work and present this resolution to Board President Williams, who has been a champion on this issue.

08:16:28.125 --> 08:16:28.485
Thank you.

08:16:29.486 --> 08:16:33.008
I'm not the president, but the board member.

08:16:43.524 --> 08:16:43.804
Thank you.

08:16:43.844 --> 08:16:44.765
Thank you for staying.

08:16:44.785 --> 08:16:46.486
Thank you for hanging out.

08:16:46.526 --> 08:16:49.008
Thank you to you guys for staying and hanging out.

08:16:49.048 --> 08:16:51.710
We'll take a photo as soon as these two items are done.

08:16:51.850 --> 08:16:54.692
So I'd like to start with, what is computer science?

08:17:03.914 --> 08:17:15.198
In technical terms, computer science is the study of computers and algorithmic processes, including their principles, their hardware and software designs, their applications, and their impact on society.

08:17:15.738 --> 08:17:19.079
In other words, computer science is the science of computing.

08:17:19.599 --> 08:17:23.961
It is a tool that helps you tell a story or make something happen with technology.

08:17:24.401 --> 08:17:29.583
It is a skill that teaches students how to use computers to create and not just consume.

08:17:31.280 --> 08:17:42.249
This journey began back in September 2014 when the governor assigned Assembly Bill 1539 into law, commencing the process for developing the first ever California Computer Science Standards.

08:17:42.910 --> 08:17:54.040
In November 2016, my staff and I traveled around California conducting focus groups to hear the thoughts and ideas from computer science educators on what should be included in the standards.

08:17:54.580 --> 08:18:02.145
Then the IQC used the focus group information and recommended to the State Board of Education guidelines to be used in the creation of the standards.

08:18:02.705 --> 08:18:08.349
The IQC also recommended and the State Board approved members of the Computer Science Standards Advisory Committee.

08:18:08.949 --> 08:18:13.872
The Computer Science Standards Advisory Committee members met four times between September 2017 and January 2018.

08:18:17.114 --> 08:18:21.955
In March, the IQC approved the draft standards for a 60-day public comment review period.

08:18:22.455 --> 08:18:29.957
And between April and June 2018, we received public comment from over a dozen individuals as well as several stakeholder groups.

08:18:30.818 --> 08:18:37.379
During the July 2018 IQC meeting, the IQC recommended changes based on the public comment received.

08:18:37.740 --> 08:18:39.180
And that brings us to today.

08:18:42.068 --> 08:18:46.711
At the foundation of the computer science standards are 21 state board adopted guidelines.

08:18:47.271 --> 08:18:49.792
These on the slide are some highlights of those guidelines.

08:18:50.173 --> 08:18:56.016
The state board of education guidelines included assurance that the standards allow for flexibility in implementation.

08:18:56.576 --> 08:19:02.139
For example, the 912 core standards and the 912 specialty standards are part of that flexibility.

08:19:02.560 --> 08:19:08.383
We realize that traditionally most students have access to at most one computer science course in high school.

08:19:08.923 --> 08:19:13.987
These standards offer the opportunity for computer science to be integrated into their current programs.

08:19:14.468 --> 08:19:18.851
In addition, the specialty standards help define content for standalone courses.

08:19:19.552 --> 08:19:31.542
The guidelines also emphasize the use of work that has already been done, such as the Computer Science Teachers Association's standards and the work of Code.org developing the Computer Science K-12 framework.

08:19:32.282 --> 08:19:40.084
The guidelines also emphasize coherence across all grade levels using clear and accessible language.

08:19:41.864 --> 08:19:53.627
So with the state board guidelines in hand, the Computer Science Standards Advisory Committee, led by co-chairs Beth Simon of UC San Diego and Brian Tworek of San Francisco Unified School District, who is here today.

08:19:53.647 --> 08:19:55.347
Brian, would you stand?

08:20:00.720 --> 08:20:04.443
They accomplished the draft standards in four two-day meetings.

08:20:04.763 --> 08:20:13.869
The group of people in this picture represent the committee members, CDE staff, and our computer science writer Catherine Goyette of Tulare County Office of Education.

08:20:14.369 --> 08:20:18.052
We also had support from Alita Hubbard and Yvonne Cao of WestEd.

08:20:18.812 --> 08:20:29.137
This was an amazing group of educators truly dedicated to ensuring high quality standards that allow for all K-12 students to experience quality computer science education.

08:20:29.637 --> 08:20:31.458
We had a lot of fun during our meetings.

08:20:31.538 --> 08:20:35.820
There may even be a video of a group chicken dance somewhere.

08:20:35.840 --> 08:20:36.900
I have it.

08:20:39.620 --> 08:20:51.484
So with 44 states who have developed or are in the process of developing computer science standards, we felt that California was in a prime position to create the gold star standards of computer science.

08:20:52.164 --> 08:20:54.525
That was often the talk of the committee.

08:20:54.785 --> 08:21:00.807
And they believe this because the committee approached the development process with the lens of access and inclusivity.

08:21:01.347 --> 08:21:08.249
They utilized that foundation work of the Computer Science Teachers Association standards and the K-12 computer science framework

08:21:08.789 --> 08:21:22.061
We also had several committee members that were part of developing those documents and felt that the California process allowed them the opportunity to improve clarity and consistency, to fill in gaps, to add interdisciplinary examples.

08:21:22.521 --> 08:21:29.708
The Standards Advisory Committee was very thoughtful in providing how each sample might look and be aligned to other content standards.

08:21:30.348 --> 08:21:35.633
So with this, I'd like to turn it over to Chair Dean Reese, that he'll go into the standards with more depth.

08:21:37.145 --> 08:21:38.125
Thank you, Dr. Gregson.

08:21:38.966 --> 08:21:42.887
So I'm going to start by talking a little bit about the introduction to the computer science standards.

08:21:43.468 --> 08:21:45.289
And the introduction starts out with a quote.

08:21:45.929 --> 08:21:52.011
And the quote says, computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.

08:21:53.052 --> 08:21:54.953
So I'll let you think about that for a little bit.

08:21:56.113 --> 08:22:02.556
And so for a time, in the field of education, we were interested in students using technology.

08:22:03.196 --> 08:22:12.081
And that brought about conferences on computer literacy, education technology, digital citizenship, and information technology.

08:22:13.702 --> 08:22:25.349
Now, with these standards, it's really more about those things, but it's also more about having students become active creators using computer science.

08:22:27.310 --> 08:22:44.202
For example, students are asked to actively engage and create learning how to code algorithms or learning how networks transfer data and the importance of cybersecurity, how to use computers as a tool to analyze large data sets, and many other aspects of the field of computer science.

08:22:44.942 --> 08:22:55.330
So the fundamental goal of these standards is to expose students to computer science so that they are well-equipped to civically engage on topics that fall under the wide umbrella of computer science.

08:22:56.010 --> 08:23:02.373
But I think what we are most proud of with these standards is that they are truly meant for all students of California.

08:23:02.914 --> 08:23:10.918
They were designed with access and equity as a primary driver in the creation of these standards and are meant for California's diverse educational landscape.

08:23:12.253 --> 08:23:18.556
The racial and gender inequalities in terms of access and equity to quality CS education are well known.

08:23:19.616 --> 08:23:32.161
And the introduction here presents these challenges and presents data that the field is looking at to basically help us understand the scale of what is at stake for our students.

08:23:33.242 --> 08:23:37.624
For instance, 60% of California students are Latinx or African-American.

08:23:38.584 --> 08:23:46.766
However, only 16% of students who take AP Computer Science A are Latinx or African-American.

08:23:47.827 --> 08:23:57.830
Furthermore, 49% of our students are female in California, but yet only 27% of our students taking Computer Science A are female.

08:23:58.270 --> 08:24:04.812
So this kind of illustrates some of these gender and racial inequalities that exist in this educational discipline.

08:24:05.572 --> 08:24:12.536
But we're basically presenting them front and center, and our goal is to try to work on these.

08:24:13.497 --> 08:24:15.518
OK, so.

08:24:17.065 --> 08:24:23.826
So this here shows the progression of K-12 California computer science standards.

08:24:24.507 --> 08:24:26.627
And it's kind of laid out by grade band.

08:24:26.687 --> 08:24:34.909
So you have the K-2 standards, 3.5 standards, 6.8 standards, 9.12 core standards, and then 9.12 specialty standards.

08:24:35.449 --> 08:24:39.470
And then on the left-hand column, you can kind of see that it's broken down within concepts.

08:24:40.581 --> 08:24:50.725
The concepts being computing systems, networks and the internet, data analysis, algorithms and programming, impacts of computing.

08:24:52.526 --> 08:24:59.869
And each one of these concepts is coupled with one of the seven practices, and those together formulate a standard.

08:25:04.787 --> 08:25:20.419
In addition, the State Board of Education guidelines presented a need for appendices that can address flexible implementation to ensure the varying types of school programs would be supported in their implementation of the computer science standards.

08:25:21.039 --> 08:25:24.141
These appendices provide guidance for school leaders and teachers.

08:25:24.722 --> 08:25:27.223
They include a glossary of computer science terms.

08:25:28.424 --> 08:25:35.946
career technical education connections, connections to other content area standards, and connections to post-secondary education.

08:25:37.487 --> 08:25:43.509
So I'd like to take a minute here and show you one of the standards.

08:25:43.649 --> 08:25:54.112
And the Computer Science Standards Advisory Committee did a pretty smart thing, because they realized that right now, currently, there's no plan for a computer science framework.

08:25:55.589 --> 08:25:59.110
And so the frameworks, of course, are how to implement the standards.

08:25:59.790 --> 08:26:12.254
And so what they wanted to do was, even though these are just computer science standards, they wanted to provide examples to the field on how a teacher might implement one of these standards.

08:26:12.294 --> 08:26:15.235
So for instance, this standard is

08:26:16.375 --> 08:26:22.281
Different algorithms can achieve the same result, though sometimes one algorithm might be more appropriate for a specific situation.

08:26:22.741 --> 08:26:28.467
Students examine different ways to solve the same task and decide which would be the better solution for the specific scenario.

08:26:29.148 --> 08:26:32.451
But then what, and this is a grade three through five standard.

08:26:34.973 --> 08:26:40.616
But what's interesting here is a history social science example was presented along with the standard.

08:26:42.036 --> 08:26:48.979
A common course state standards math example was also presented, as well as an ELA example.

08:26:49.039 --> 08:27:03.306
So these standards were really created with the spirit of integration, not as an additional kind of discipline to teach necessarily, but thinking that the way we can kind of

08:27:03.846 --> 08:27:19.408
incorporate these standards into the instruction of a teacher is by creating integrated units that will couple what they're already doing in, let's say, history, social science, math, or ELA with these new computer science standards.

08:27:21.232 --> 08:27:23.736
Okay, and now I'll hand it back over to Dr. Gregson.

08:27:23.956 --> 08:27:24.798
Thank you, Chair Reese.

08:27:25.699 --> 08:27:26.580
So what happens next?

08:27:26.780 --> 08:27:34.192
Well, once the State Board takes action today, we'll work on the design and editing of the standards, including working on an online platform for the standards.

08:27:34.412 --> 08:27:36.335
They are, after all, computer science standards.

08:27:37.276 --> 08:27:43.339
So, you'll be hearing about the Computer Science Implementation Plan later in the next item from my colleague Barbara Murchinson.

08:27:43.880 --> 08:27:48.742
And also, you can follow the hashtag CS4CA, which is Computer Science for California.

08:27:49.063 --> 08:27:58.007
This is a coalition of multiple agencies led by ACCESS who are ready and willing to support the computer science education at all levels.

08:27:58.468 --> 08:28:02.530
So, those are some of the elements that we have going on after the standards are adopted.

08:28:04.614 --> 08:28:12.519
So this endeavor was a true collaborative team effort with the dedication of many, including our Computer Science Champion Board Member Williams.

08:28:13.400 --> 08:28:30.310
With all of the support and passion of all involved, I am honored and proud to bring to you the recommendation from the California Department of Education and the Instructional Quality Commission that the State Board of Education adopt the draft California Computer Science Standards as the first California Computer Science Standards.

08:28:31.711 --> 08:28:31.831
Great.

08:28:33.083 --> 08:28:36.024
Board Member Williams, you certainly deserve to go first.

08:28:36.104 --> 08:28:41.126
What a long, long effort here to bring off such a great outcome.

08:28:41.306 --> 08:28:44.667
I really didn't know what would happen with these when we started.

08:28:44.767 --> 08:28:45.727
I mean, what were they?

08:28:45.807 --> 08:28:47.027
What was it going to be?

08:28:47.047 --> 08:28:49.188
Was it going to be?

08:28:49.208 --> 08:28:51.049
That's another question.

08:28:51.229 --> 08:28:55.130
So it's, yeah, really a lot of progress.

08:28:55.777 --> 08:29:01.358
So I want to make a couple of preface comments and then share some feedback on the standards.

08:29:02.198 --> 08:29:19.702
First of all, I'll remind President Kirst that this all started with you and I in May of 2014 when Hadi Partovi at Code.org sent a letter to Governor Brown asking for a meeting to talk about why California should be expanding computer science in K-12.

08:29:21.082 --> 08:29:26.524
And Governor Brown, of course, sent that letter to you and said, please advise what should I do about this?

08:29:26.644 --> 08:29:33.487
And you and I having been colleagues over two decades now, you sent it to me and said, what do you think we should do about this?

08:29:34.047 --> 08:29:35.748
And I said, I don't have a clue.

08:29:35.768 --> 08:29:37.349
I was an English major.

08:29:38.109 --> 08:29:40.270
This was way over my head.

08:29:40.310 --> 08:29:42.511
And I said, let me figure this out.

08:29:43.291 --> 08:29:46.014
So I basically did some homework.

08:29:46.454 --> 08:29:48.637
You guys know I like to do my homework, my research.

08:29:48.717 --> 08:29:50.879
And then I contacted Hadi Partovi.

08:29:50.919 --> 08:30:03.472
He came and met with Mike and I here at the State Board, spent two hours talking to us about what this campaign of Code.org was all about, why it was about, why now, why computer science, why all kids.

08:30:04.153 --> 08:30:05.294
And we just went from there.

08:30:05.794 --> 08:30:15.418
Mike basically gave me free reign and said, let's go figure out what all we should be doing about this and who the experts are and how we should think about it.

08:30:16.058 --> 08:30:17.639
And so that's four years ago.

08:30:18.723 --> 08:30:21.764
So this day, it has been a long time coming for me.

08:30:22.404 --> 08:30:25.485
I want to thank Hadi for bringing the opportunity to us.

08:30:26.165 --> 08:30:40.888
I want to thank Pat Young Prattett, who is the chief academic officer of Code.org, and who was the spearhead or the staff lead for the K-12 computer science framework, the national framework.

08:30:41.568 --> 08:30:46.071
And the board may remember that he spoke to you about the framework in January 2017.

08:30:48.393 --> 08:30:54.737
Both of them have provided tremendous support to me personally and to California for moving this agenda forward.

08:30:55.337 --> 08:30:58.359
And I also want to thank all of the computer science advocates.

08:30:58.419 --> 08:31:01.141
We only have a few of them sitting in the audience today.

08:31:02.182 --> 08:31:07.005
We have Brian Twork, we have Deborah Richardson, we had David Miyashiro.

08:31:07.025 --> 08:31:09.026
I think that's all.

08:31:10.287 --> 08:31:11.048
Anybody I missed?

08:31:13.129 --> 08:31:22.814
But then I'm going to also acknowledge, do a shout out to Julie Flappen with Access, who took on the CS for California Advocacy Coalition.

08:31:23.694 --> 08:31:31.378
She's just a bundle of energy and has been the person that says when people say, I got an idea, she says, let me see if I can help make that happen.

08:31:32.038 --> 08:31:34.100
So she's been really instrumental as well.

08:31:34.680 --> 08:31:46.530
And so my point in all this is I want to share this resolution with everyone I just mentioned, including Dean, including the IQC, including Stephanie, including Barbara.

08:31:47.750 --> 08:32:02.938
including the rest of the CDE staff and Tom, and also Glenn Price, who had dinner with me a couple of times in 2014, 2015, when I said, are you willing to have some dinner with me and talk about this computer science thing?

08:32:02.978 --> 08:32:05.360
And I want to see what CDE thinks about it.

08:32:05.760 --> 08:32:07.961
And so we basically kind of teamed up.

08:32:08.982 --> 08:32:12.744
He was supportive on the CDE side, and I was the lead on the state board side.

08:32:12.804 --> 08:32:13.244
So that was

08:32:13.624 --> 08:32:17.869
really powerful for us moving it this far along.

08:32:18.650 --> 08:32:28.062
So that said, before we move on the standards, I want to read you an email I got from Pat Young Prattett this morning, the Code.org academic officer.

08:32:28.082 --> 08:32:29.264
I asked him,

08:32:30.265 --> 08:32:40.550
What are your thoughts about the standards that we just developed, that the Standards Committee just developed, about how well they align or reflect with the CSK-12 framework?

08:32:41.090 --> 08:32:43.231
And how do they compare with what other states have done?

08:32:43.971 --> 08:32:53.375
And what he said was, they align very well with the vision and concepts and practices in the framework, some of the strongest connections to the framework that I've seen.

08:32:53.395 --> 08:32:59.138
And by the way, he oversees all the states and their work on standards, so he knows what everybody is doing.

08:32:59.798 --> 08:33:07.603
They are clear, to the point, read easily, have well-written explanations, and make interdisciplinary connections.

08:33:08.363 --> 08:33:22.612
I would have no qualms pointing people to the California Computer Science Standards as a model, simply because of the attention to the framework and the attention to improving on the CSTA standards versus just copying them.

08:33:23.012 --> 08:33:25.394
And that was referenced a little while ago about Brian

08:33:25.974 --> 08:33:37.000
One of the strengths about Brian's leadership on the Standards Committee is that he was involved as a writer on both the Computer Science Teachers Association Standards and the National K-12 Framework.

08:33:37.380 --> 08:33:42.843
So he not only knew those really well, but he also knew how to improve upon them for California.

08:33:42.903 --> 08:33:44.284
That was a real strength we had.

08:33:44.884 --> 08:33:47.746
And finally, Pat Young Prattett said, and also

08:33:48.686 --> 08:33:58.039
Hands down, California ran the most comprehensive, diligent, and public process for computer science standards development of any state.

08:33:58.440 --> 08:34:01.224
Computer science advocates in California should be proud.

08:34:02.426 --> 08:34:03.287
I know I'm proud.

08:34:04.287 --> 08:34:07.349
I am excited that we're at this stage.

08:34:07.429 --> 08:34:10.231
I'm excited that we finally got here.

08:34:11.072 --> 08:34:12.372
It felt for a couple of years.

08:34:12.513 --> 08:34:28.183
Frankly, I would go to computer science-oriented meetings and have other states, some of them kind of rural states, I won't mention a name, where they would say, we're leading the nation now for computer science.

08:34:29.028 --> 08:34:32.829
And everybody'd kind of look at me like, and California, are you guys doing anything?

08:34:33.290 --> 08:34:35.150
It was it was kind of rough for a while.

08:34:35.791 --> 08:34:38.372
I used to say I have small state envy.

08:34:39.192 --> 08:34:44.094
Because in California, we are so big and so complex, we do not turn on a dime.

08:34:44.414 --> 08:34:45.194
It takes a while.

08:34:45.975 --> 08:34:46.635
And it did.

08:34:46.915 --> 08:34:47.575
And we are here.

08:34:47.975 --> 08:34:52.837
So I, I, I am open to hearing comment and questions.

08:34:53.297 --> 08:34:54.718
And then I'll be ready to make a motion.

08:34:57.202 --> 08:35:00.426
Okay, is there comment by board members?

08:35:00.506 --> 08:35:01.768
Is there public comment on this?

08:35:01.948 --> 08:35:06.033
Yeah, why don't we hear that and then we'll have... Okay.

08:35:06.894 --> 08:35:09.297
The following individuals please line up at the podium.

08:35:09.518 --> 08:35:15.045
Justin Goodrick, Michael Flores-Castaneda, Brian Twarek, Deborah Richardson.

08:35:21.849 --> 08:35:22.529
My legs are numb.

08:35:23.410 --> 08:35:27.611
Justin Goodrich, principal at Cajon Valley Middle School and member of the Cajon Valley Union School District.

08:35:28.552 --> 08:35:37.575
We'd like to thank the stakeholders participating in the oversight and development of the computer science standards and emphasize our support for the integration of digital literacy in the K-12 classrooms.

08:35:38.195 --> 08:35:45.738
However, we would like the board to examine the impact that adding additional content standards has on students and educators at the site level

08:35:46.438 --> 08:35:52.643
many of who are already struggling to meet the expectations placed upon them by our current curricular frameworks.

08:35:53.504 --> 08:36:01.930
The result is a systematic failure of overall student achievement, particularly for students living in poverty, and a reduction in student self-efficacy.

08:36:03.391 --> 08:36:16.841
We respectfully request that the State Board re-examine the whole of the content state frameworks through the lens of educating the whole child and preparing for the 21st century learner for the world of work.

08:36:17.621 --> 08:36:35.745
We urge you to consider opportunities for the integration of social-emotional learning and the intentional teaching of soft skills such as effective communication, presentation literacy, collaboration, and empathy, all of which have been identified by major companies throughout the world as critical attributes of effective employees in the workplace.

08:36:36.165 --> 08:36:40.006
We request that you reduce or eliminate any non-essential standards.

08:36:40.046 --> 08:36:40.946
Thank you for listening to me.

08:36:40.966 --> 08:36:41.866
I talked as fast as I could.

08:36:41.966 --> 08:36:42.206
Thank you.

08:36:46.039 --> 08:36:51.681
Hi, I'm Brian Twork, and I'm from the San Francisco Unified School District and co-chaired the Standards Advisory Committee.

08:36:51.701 --> 08:37:00.184
I want to thank Board Member Williams, as well as the leadership of the CDE and IQC in this process, and emphasize a few points.

08:37:01.064 --> 08:37:04.846
We started with some really great products that were national frameworks and standards.

08:37:05.346 --> 08:37:11.268
And as Board Member Williams and Dr. Gregson mentioned, we made them this way better.

08:37:11.608 --> 08:37:14.649
And I'm very proud of our gold standard standards.

08:37:14.709 --> 08:37:15.889
And I think that you should be too.

08:37:15.909 --> 08:37:18.470
A few points.

08:37:19.290 --> 08:37:22.391
One is that they are very much focused on the achievement of all students.

08:37:22.891 --> 08:37:25.212
And we had this lens of equity inclusion throughout.

08:37:25.572 --> 08:37:28.973
And so we wanted to make sure that all of the learning outcomes were doable by all students.

08:37:29.793 --> 08:37:35.295
To support that, we gave a lot of guidance for how to implement and also integrate with other subject matter.

08:37:36.835 --> 08:37:44.462
Those are based on what's already happening throughout California, but it also sets a vision for what it can be in the future and at scale.

08:37:45.964 --> 08:37:47.946
That was based on the strong expertise of the community.

08:37:48.973 --> 08:37:49.994
Whoops, you can finish.

08:37:50.534 --> 08:37:50.995
Oh, thanks.

08:37:51.575 --> 08:37:58.862
That was based on the strong expertise and experience of the committee members, which was a pretty fantastic group.

08:37:59.462 --> 08:38:06.188
And in summary, I'm just very excited for the precedent that we are setting now as California, because I know that other states are already looking at what we're doing.

08:38:07.009 --> 08:38:07.189
Thanks.

08:38:12.068 --> 08:38:13.249
Hi, I'm Deborah Richardson.

08:38:13.409 --> 08:38:22.215
I'm from UC Irvine, and I'm also with ACCESS, that Trish mentioned, and the CS for California campaign.

08:38:22.275 --> 08:38:27.899
I just want to stress how important it is that all of California's students be exposed to high quality computer science education.

08:38:27.939 --> 08:38:38.026
Those points have been made before, but we need to prepare them for the skills they need for career and college readiness, as well as civic and community engagement.

08:38:38.946 --> 08:38:52.035
These standards, although not required, will make it more likely that students have equitable access to quality computer science education because teachers, schools, administrators can have a better understanding of what computer science is and what students should be learning.

08:38:53.388 --> 08:39:00.392
As Trish mentioned, we think of California as a leader, but in fact there are 21 states that have already adopted computer science standards.

08:39:01.833 --> 08:39:06.895
And along with the recommendations in the next item, adopting these standards will move the state forward.

08:39:07.676 --> 08:39:14.319
I want to thank the Standards Advisory Committee as well as CDE, the IQC, and Trish for their efforts.

08:39:14.719 --> 08:39:19.222
I urge the board to approve these standards and thank you for your support of computer science in California.

08:39:21.693 --> 08:39:23.474
And I want to make just a couple more comments.

08:39:24.014 --> 08:39:25.995
One is computer science.

08:39:26.195 --> 08:39:27.376
These are model standards.

08:39:27.716 --> 08:39:38.201
And I know that Tom often says they're all model standards, but they're not all model standards when they come with state summative tests that get results reported out.

08:39:38.261 --> 08:39:41.443
So those have a lot more influence behind them.

08:39:42.243 --> 08:39:49.348
These are designed to serve as, and this is in the state board's guidance to them, to the committee.

08:39:50.129 --> 08:40:04.900
They were designed to serve as substantive guidance for LEAs who want to bring computer science into their curricula and to allow flexibility on how they do that, that meets the needs of their students and their local community.

08:40:05.680 --> 08:40:07.421
So that's one point.

08:40:07.581 --> 08:40:11.803
It's not layering another set of standards on top of all the other standards.

08:40:11.883 --> 08:40:18.265
It's offering another set of guidance for schools that want to bring this in.

08:40:18.666 --> 08:40:28.810
And what I've seen just in the four years is we've got a lot of districts who have already brought computer science into their districts without even having computer science standards or any other guidance.

08:40:29.330 --> 08:40:36.555
It's just kind of taking off like wildfire in terms of face validity, like, well, yes, I see why this is important.

08:40:37.316 --> 08:40:38.737
I see why we should do this.

08:40:39.857 --> 08:40:43.740
And so an example of that is that the

08:40:45.501 --> 08:40:51.286
The data about computer science AP course taking that was cited a few minutes ago was 2016 data.

08:40:51.306 --> 08:40:55.609
2017 data, the percent of Hispanics taking computer science AP course went from 16% in 2016 to 25% in 2017.

08:40:55.969 --> 08:40:57.010
That's a pretty big leap.

08:40:57.030 --> 08:41:00.693
So this, whether it's at the high school, more at the high school level because you have

08:41:14.304 --> 08:41:17.046
you now have two college board AP exams.

08:41:18.287 --> 08:41:23.932
So it's taking off faster, I think, at the high school level than it is in elementary and middle school.

08:41:25.153 --> 08:41:26.074
But it is taking off.

08:41:26.094 --> 08:41:29.657
Okay.

08:41:29.837 --> 08:41:30.758
Other board comments?

08:41:30.818 --> 08:41:31.979
Board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

08:41:34.309 --> 08:41:34.649
Thank you.

08:41:34.689 --> 08:41:44.983
I was able to delve a little bit into the standards because, as it turns out, when I wear my other hat, I'm getting ready to launch a coding program for middle school Latinos.

08:41:45.383 --> 08:41:47.686
So I thought, well, let me go and see what they already have here.

08:41:49.128 --> 08:41:55.356
And I think that one first, I think you're the first to ever use Latinx in one of our official standards.

08:41:56.177 --> 08:41:57.498
Very ahead of the game.

08:41:57.598 --> 08:41:58.259
Thank you.

08:41:58.339 --> 08:42:01.603
The rest of us need to catch up in terms of our other standards that we have.

08:42:02.444 --> 08:42:06.248
And I understand that the reality in the classroom is there's so much to teach.

08:42:06.329 --> 08:42:06.569
There's

08:42:07.349 --> 08:42:10.611
a lot of competing interests in limited time.

08:42:11.072 --> 08:42:23.920
But, you know, when I was going through my research of looking at how to develop this model with the emphasis on equity, soft skill development, civic engagement through coding, because that is very possible.

08:42:23.960 --> 08:42:31.525
In fact, there was a report, Hashtag More Than Code, that just really looks at how is this, how does this relate to civic engagement,

08:42:32.325 --> 08:42:37.548
advocacy and equity as it relates to students of color, in particular Latinx and African-American students.

08:42:39.029 --> 08:42:46.092
So I think that people always focus on just what the computer board is and what it's doing, but there's actually so many uses for that coding.

08:42:46.893 --> 08:42:57.198
But my husband actually uses coding through a curriculum that I won't mention, but he's using coding with fifth grade students that are predominantly Latino, 70% English learners.

08:42:59.159 --> 08:43:01.860
It is something that he hasn't formally introduced.

08:43:01.920 --> 08:43:06.402
But when students are done with their lesson, the accelerated students move on to coding.

08:43:07.102 --> 08:43:07.783
I tried it.

08:43:07.883 --> 08:43:11.164
My little mouse just kind of flipped and did nothing else.

08:43:11.624 --> 08:43:15.045
But the students are eager to get their hands on this.

08:43:15.146 --> 08:43:16.986
And I know that technology is an issue.

08:43:17.006 --> 08:43:21.028
Not everyone has a Chromebook or not everyone has one-on-one technology.

08:43:21.428 --> 08:43:27.974
But I think that we need to move the field because our students need that, and they need to be competitive, and they need to be relevant.

08:43:28.234 --> 08:43:30.697
And their skill set needs to reflect that.

08:43:31.017 --> 08:43:32.799
So kudos on this framework, on the standards.

08:43:35.458 --> 08:43:37.979
Board member Valdez, yeah.

08:43:38.920 --> 08:43:40.781
This is so exciting and thank you for doing this.

08:43:40.801 --> 08:43:58.331
I think you've evened the playing field because as computer science was rolling out it was like the luck of who they had on staff and so now I think the opportunities there and I really appreciate the integration and the idea that you're creating not just you know using the computer for other things so this is very very exciting so thank you for the work.

08:44:01.772 --> 08:44:02.573
Board member Sandoval.

08:44:04.651 --> 08:44:05.492
Congratulations.

08:44:05.532 --> 08:44:07.334
I think the draft is very well written.

08:44:07.354 --> 08:44:09.155
I had an opportunity to review it.

08:44:09.396 --> 08:44:15.382
And I really appreciate the relevance to so many areas.

08:44:15.703 --> 08:44:21.409
And I love the highlight on problem solving and digital citizenship and collaboration and creativity.

08:44:21.429 --> 08:44:25.593
And these are things that if we can help our students

08:44:26.574 --> 08:44:30.996
practice these skills in many different ways, it's going to make our world better.

08:44:31.636 --> 08:44:32.457
It really is.

08:44:32.537 --> 08:44:39.499
And so I really appreciate also the focus on universal design as well.

08:44:40.140 --> 08:44:41.760
And so just congratulations.

08:44:41.800 --> 08:44:48.103
And I look forward to seeing what the results are of feedback from the public.

08:44:52.092 --> 08:44:52.812
It's very exciting.

08:44:52.852 --> 08:45:00.914
I just want to thank Board Member Williams for her leadership and Dean also and Stephanie for your work through IQC and through the CDE and the whole team approach.

08:45:00.934 --> 08:45:07.976
I mean, this is really exciting as I think about what we need to do to get our kids and grandkids really ready for the 21st century.

08:45:08.036 --> 08:45:11.956
And I just appreciate the district comment about there's a lot of stuff going on right now.

08:45:11.997 --> 08:45:13.077
There's a lot of frameworks.

08:45:13.097 --> 08:45:13.977
There's a lot of standards.

08:45:14.497 --> 08:45:22.887
That whole idea of integrating the work and helping people see that these are not separate pieces, but they're tools and they can be integrated, I think we need to think about.

08:45:22.907 --> 08:45:28.533
And again, we adopt policy and then obviously the districts and the counties help support that.

08:45:29.534 --> 08:45:31.435
CD, the rollout and the implementation.

08:45:31.455 --> 08:45:36.338
But I think we need to use that voice of helping people see how all the parts fit together.

08:45:36.379 --> 08:45:38.000
This is not another separate piece.

08:45:38.100 --> 08:45:43.703
It's, I mean, it's important model standards, but that there's ways to integrate it into the work that we're doing.

08:45:43.723 --> 08:45:45.024
It's very, very exciting.

08:45:45.084 --> 08:45:56.832
And I actually would love to see how this rolls out and do an update, you know, six months, a year from now, because we know this is just the beginning as we think about what our science discussion was and where that's going.

08:45:57.492 --> 08:46:03.293
Anyway, I want to thank you and the whole committee and advisory and for all of you who stayed through all of our hearings today to be here.

08:46:03.813 --> 08:46:12.915
This is actually a wonderful highlight and kind of a capstone to a pretty intense day about kind of looking forward to what we do in classrooms and schools with kids.

08:46:12.955 --> 08:46:14.415
So just thank you for that work.

08:46:17.795 --> 08:46:20.796
Okay, I think we're ready for the recommendation.

08:46:23.776 --> 08:46:26.637
I recommend that we approve these computer science standards.

08:46:28.576 --> 08:46:28.896
Second.

08:46:29.176 --> 08:46:29.637
I'll second.

08:46:30.357 --> 08:46:30.557
OK.

08:46:31.278 --> 08:46:32.658
Any further board discussion?

08:46:33.419 --> 08:46:34.779
If not, raise your hands.

08:46:34.980 --> 08:46:35.400
All right.

08:46:35.540 --> 08:46:36.420
A lot of smiles.

08:46:36.500 --> 08:46:36.821
Yeah.

08:46:37.541 --> 08:46:37.661
OK.

08:46:38.321 --> 08:46:38.602
Good.

08:46:45.065 --> 08:46:47.507
Now we're on to item eight.

08:46:48.747 --> 08:46:56.351
Barbara Murchison will present this on the California Computer Science Strategic Implementation Plan panel.

08:46:56.912 --> 08:46:57.352
Hi, everyone.

08:47:00.779 --> 08:47:03.041
Good afternoon, evening, good evening.

08:47:03.721 --> 08:47:08.886
President Kerr, Superintendent, Chief Deputy of Price, and board members.

08:47:09.366 --> 08:47:13.389
I'm Barbara Murchison, Director of the Educator Excellence and Equity Division.

08:47:14.250 --> 08:47:16.932
This evening, I'm going to present to you the recommend, can you hear me?

08:47:17.353 --> 08:47:17.673
Okay.

08:47:18.013 --> 08:47:24.679
This evening, I'm going to present to you the recommendations of the California Computer Science Strategic Implementation Plan Panel.

08:47:25.299 --> 08:47:26.459
or CSIP for short.

08:47:26.900 --> 08:47:35.903
These recommendations will be used to inform California's Computer Science Strategic Implementation Plan, which we anticipate will be presented to the State Board in March of 2019.

08:47:36.003 --> 08:47:44.986
So just so we can all relax a little bit, this is an information item and we are not recommending any action at this time.

08:47:45.006 --> 08:47:49.248
So you can just relax and enjoy hearing about the work of this pretty fabulous panel.

08:47:50.879 --> 08:48:01.342
So California Education Code requires the superintendent to develop and the state board to consider adopting a computer science strategic implementation plan on or before July 15, 2019.

08:48:03.943 --> 08:48:12.826
Code also requires the superintendent to convene a computer science strategic implementation advisory panel to develop recommendations for the plan.

08:48:14.006 --> 08:48:19.008
So the statute, which is relatively complicated, calls for a two-part process.

08:48:20.106 --> 08:48:28.851
First, the development of the recommendations by the appointed panel, and then the development of a plan based upon informed by those recommendations.

08:48:29.392 --> 08:48:36.316
So just to be super clear, this item represents the final step of the first part of that process.

08:48:36.816 --> 08:48:45.622
At the end of the presentation, I'll share a little bit of information regarding the plan development process, but today I'm here primarily to share the recommendations of the panel.

08:48:48.183 --> 08:49:03.389
So just very briefly, so you know the who's who of the 23-person panel, panel members were appointed by the governor, President Kirst, the Senate Committee on Rules, the Speaker of the Assembly, and the superintendent, and were selected based on their expertise in computer science.

08:49:06.780 --> 08:49:16.824
The 23 appointees included K-12 teachers from each grade span, representatives from the Commission on Teacher Credentialing, the Computer Science Teachers Association, and private industry.

08:49:17.364 --> 08:49:22.045
Faculty from each of the four higher education segments were also appointed to serve on the panel.

08:49:22.505 --> 08:49:32.529
One thing that I think is really interesting is that you'll notice that there are many through lines from the computer science, the committee that created the standards,

08:49:33.149 --> 08:49:36.030
to the implementation plan panel and the IQC.

08:49:36.070 --> 08:49:44.655
So a lot of the folks who you see behind us and more folks who aren't here participated in both the standards development and the development of the recommendations.

08:49:44.935 --> 08:49:50.458
And we will be moving the plan through the IQC to leverage all that expertise and have that through line throughout.

08:49:50.598 --> 08:49:54.480
So, you know, the IQC has just learned all about computer science standards.

08:49:54.500 --> 08:49:59.202
We want to make sure that they have that integrated into the final plan.

08:50:00.911 --> 08:50:16.393
Appointees also included a teacher from the Instructional Quality Commission, Chair Reese, a representative from an equity-focused organization, a representative from a parent organization, a public school student, and administrators from school districts and a county office of education.

08:50:18.632 --> 08:50:25.433
More information regarding the panel, including the names and organizations represented, is provided in the attachment itself.

08:50:25.913 --> 08:50:31.254
But I do want to take a moment to recognize our two co-chairs, Deborah Richardson and David Miyashiro.

08:50:31.814 --> 08:50:47.857
In addition to participating in the public meetings of the panel and leading the work of the panel, the co-chairs dedicated many hours between each of those meetings, working with the CDE team to plan the meetings and provide feedback on various drafts of the recommendations.

08:50:50.512 --> 08:50:52.413
They're going to be standing a whole bunch more times.

08:50:52.893 --> 08:50:55.993
Would you please stand, co-chairs, so we can recognize your work?

08:50:59.934 --> 08:51:00.294
Thank you.

08:51:01.455 --> 08:51:11.657
At the last meeting of the panel, the group delegated final approval authority to the co-chairs, and they worked with the CDE staff to polish and refine the document that you have before you today.

08:51:14.153 --> 08:51:22.040
So once the panel was appointed, the CDE convened three two-day public meetings of the panel here in Sacramento in March, April, and June.

08:51:22.760 --> 08:51:34.810
To inform the work of the panel, the CDE invited experts to provide presentations on various topics, including sessions on the standards themselves and the status of credentialing requirements for computer science educators.

08:51:35.491 --> 08:51:41.356
These were public meetings, and the CDE and panel provided opportunities on each day for public comment.

08:51:43.965 --> 08:51:53.833
Statute requires that the panel develop a set of recommendations for a computer science strategic implementation plan that addresses, at minimum, the following topics.

08:51:54.453 --> 08:52:00.438
Broadening the pool of teachers to teach computer science, because as we just discussed, sometimes that can be a little bit haphazard.

08:52:00.478 --> 08:52:02.600
If you have a teacher who can do it, then the kids get it.

08:52:03.340 --> 08:52:20.033
Obviously, the state will want to expand the pool of teachers who can teach computer science, defining computer science education principles that meet the needs of pupils in kindergarten and grades 1 through 12, and ensuring that pupils have access to high-quality computer science courses.

08:52:20.093 --> 08:52:22.215
So this came directly from the statute.

08:52:25.171 --> 08:52:33.500
In addition to the required principles and recommendations, the panel developed an overall vision for computer science education in California as well as a mission.

08:52:34.101 --> 08:52:44.513
The vision is on the screen in front of you to ensure that all students develop foundational knowledge and skills in computer science to prepare them for college, careers, and civic engagement.

08:52:46.260 --> 08:52:54.306
And the mission is that all schools offer rigorous and relevant computer science education equitably and sustainably throughout grades K through 12.

08:52:55.487 --> 08:53:03.672
All teachers should be adequately prepared to teach rigorous and relevant computer science aligned with California's K-12 computer science standards.

08:53:06.314 --> 08:53:09.517
The panel developed eight computer science education principles.

08:53:10.970 --> 08:53:14.813
The first three principles on the screen now are grounded in equity.

08:53:15.033 --> 08:53:23.480
And really, the equity was a through line throughout all of the conversation, making sure that all of our students have access to high quality computer science education.

08:53:24.639 --> 08:53:41.812
The panel felt very strongly that every student should have equitable access and that those opportunities for computer science education are continuous throughout their educational careers and that there are multiple entry points for students to engage with computer science from K through 12.

08:53:44.008 --> 08:53:48.249
The next set of principles describe a little bit more about what that education should look like.

08:53:48.710 --> 08:54:01.494
The panel felt very strongly that computer science education should be grounded in real world engaging activities that emphasize critical thinking and creativity, and that computer science education should align with the new computer science standards.

08:54:02.505 --> 08:54:15.054
the most recently adopted state board standards, and that those standards should be leveraged in a variety of ways, both integrated into other subject areas and used as standalone courses.

08:54:16.375 --> 08:54:26.782
The sixth principle put forth by the panel is that all schools should have the appropriate infrastructure to support computer science education, including software, hardware, and personnel.

08:54:29.704 --> 08:54:43.113
Principle 7 is about making sure that teachers have opportunities to learn computer science content and pedagogy, both in preparation and for those teachers who are already in service as part of ongoing professional learning.

08:54:43.834 --> 08:54:53.020
And Principle 8 is about making sure that we have partnerships with stakeholders across the educational system and with industry to support computer science implementation.

08:54:56.041 --> 08:55:04.285
So the panel's recommendations are organized and labeled according to the requirements in education code, and are divided into three broad categories.

08:55:05.526 --> 08:55:09.068
The access and equity standards, and there's a longer title, but it's late.

08:55:09.988 --> 08:55:16.072
The educator support standard, or recommendations, and the standards implementation standards.

08:55:16.712 --> 08:55:21.995
The relevant section, recommendations, no standards, standards was item seven, pardon me.

08:55:22.335 --> 08:55:24.296
These are recommendations, three sets.

08:55:26.069 --> 08:55:30.172
The relevant sections of Ed Code also contain a number of subsections.

08:55:30.653 --> 08:55:37.419
And we use the language in the subsections to organize the work and to ensure that we are addressing all of the requirements.

08:55:37.859 --> 08:55:41.222
So you'll see those subsections listed throughout the document.

08:55:43.717 --> 08:55:48.942
The panel's final recommendations are provided in chart form starting on page nine of your attachment.

08:55:49.742 --> 08:55:57.029
Each recommendation includes the entity responsible for implementation, and you can see on the screen there are many different, there's something for everyone in here.

08:56:00.092 --> 08:56:06.617
The proposed strategy itself, what evidence of success of that strategy would look like, and a timeline.

08:56:07.378 --> 08:56:21.531
Before we go into the recommendations, and it has been said before, but I want to be very clear, these are just recommendations for local educational agencies and policymakers for use in furthering computer science education here in California.

08:56:21.571 --> 08:56:23.273
They are not requirements.

08:56:23.353 --> 08:56:27.336
I know anytime anyone sees a big set of something, they're like, oh, what does this mean for us?

08:56:27.817 --> 08:56:30.659
We should consider this as kind of guidance from

08:56:31.460 --> 08:56:39.443
appointed experts in computer science on how we can move computer science further, both at the local level and at the state level.

08:56:40.204 --> 08:56:43.885
Further, this is not a one-size-fits-all set of recommendations.

08:56:43.925 --> 08:56:52.489
The panel recognized that different LEAs are in different stages of implementing computer science, and many districts have already implemented some of the recommendations.

08:56:53.169 --> 08:57:00.272
Again, this document should really be considered a helpful, a set of helpful guidance recommendations from a panel of experts.

08:57:01.638 --> 08:57:08.720
Finally, as you look at the document, you'll notice some overlap between the sections and across the organizational framework.

08:57:09.180 --> 08:57:19.924
For example, as the panel was talking about how to ensure access and equity, sometimes that came down to making sure that teachers across the state are

08:57:22.478 --> 08:57:25.161
are able to provide high quality computer science education.

08:57:25.261 --> 08:57:37.854
So there's clearly an overlap between some of the recommendations you'll see in the access and equity section and those that you'll see in the educator support section because it's really, when we talk about systems, it's all connected.

08:57:38.554 --> 08:57:42.058
But it's just trying to talk you through how they're organized in the chart.

08:57:44.167 --> 08:57:49.274
So on to the recommendations, and I'll move pretty quickly through them, given the late hour.

08:57:50.876 --> 08:57:56.464
But as we've noted a couple of different times, equity permeated pretty much all of the conversations.

08:57:56.524 --> 08:57:59.848
It always came back to, how do we make sure this can happen for all kids?

08:58:00.569 --> 08:58:27.145
The access and equity recommendations include creating more robust computer science education offerings in kindergarten through grade eight so that students are prepared for additional coursework in high school, providing professional development for educators on the computer science standards, adopting high school graduation requirements for computer science, and offering A through G approved course sequences, as well as having computer science courses approved for areas other than G.

08:58:31.189 --> 08:58:47.778
The set of recommendations also includes ensuring that California students have access to computer science in both college and career pathways, and ensuring that California school districts have the infrastructure, hardware, software, and information technology personnel necessary to implement computer science courses.

08:58:48.698 --> 08:59:04.612
The panel also recommended that we develop rollouts for the computer science standards, as we've done for other state board adopted standards, and that CSESA, our County Superintendents Association, create a new curriculum and instruction steering committee, subcommittee, just for computer science.

08:59:05.253 --> 08:59:14.641
They also recommended doing outreach, especially to traditionally underrepresented groups, to create awareness and advocacy for computer science education.

08:59:17.383 --> 08:59:35.684
They recommended that LEAs develop or expand partnerships with community organizations to create opportunities for expanded learning and scholarship, internship and mentorship, and that tools be created for teachers and school counselors to help guide underrepresented students into various computer science pathways.

08:59:36.425 --> 08:59:54.018
Finally, in the access and equity section, the panel recommended that data regarding enrollment and achievement in computer science be collected by the CDE in any future data collection kind of updates, and that computer science be included in the college and career readiness indicator on the local control accountability plan.

08:59:57.020 --> 09:00:04.145
So we had the largest number of recommendations when we were talking about supporting educators to teach computer science.

09:00:05.799 --> 09:00:25.867
The educator support recommendations include providing computer science professional development for both current and future teachers, counselors, and administrators, working with institutions of higher education to recruit potential computer science educators, and creating local communities of practice so that computer science teachers can learn from one another in the local level.

09:00:26.807 --> 09:00:54.320
The panel also recommended developing toolkits and modules for teachers in each grade band, offering credit-bearing computer science courses in community colleges, developing a directory of colleges that offer coursework for supplementary authorization in computer science, so it's that much easier for interested teachers to gain that supplementary authorization, and supporting the UC Office of the President to develop a new California subject matter project for computer science.

09:00:57.435 --> 09:01:09.684
Finally, in this section, the panel recommended funding a position at the CDE to support computer science implementation and funding the Commission on Teacher Credentialing to develop a single subject credential in computer science.

09:01:10.364 --> 09:01:24.515
They also recommended expanding scholarship eligibility and loan forgiveness programs for computer science teachers in rural and urban low-income and underserved school districts and recruiting and training industry professionals to become computer science teachers.

09:01:27.230 --> 09:01:41.129
The last set of recommendations, scaling up K-12 computer science education, known as the standards implementation recommendations, call for statewide support as local districts move forward in implementing California's standards.

09:01:42.025 --> 09:01:53.929
The panel recommended conducting a communications campaign to make sure stakeholders are aware of the new standards and the implementation plan and providing funding to LEAs during the initial implementation phase.

09:01:54.629 --> 09:02:10.554
They also felt that it would be important for the state to provide guidance regarding instructional materials for computer science courses and to review the standards every seven years to provide updates as needed and to encourage districts to create local four-year implementation plans.

09:02:12.435 --> 09:02:23.681
This section of the document also includes identifying early implementers and elevate those best practices and providing funding for LEAs for an initial implementation period.

09:02:26.823 --> 09:02:28.684
So with one vision,

09:02:30.109 --> 09:02:38.154
two mission statements, eight principles, and 49 distinct recommendations.

09:02:39.075 --> 09:02:43.078
I think we could safely say that this was a very hardworking panel.

09:02:43.518 --> 09:02:49.362
And here they are at the end of the last day, still smiling.

09:02:50.823 --> 09:02:55.406
So I'd like to take a minute to ask our panel members in attendance to stand again.

09:02:55.566 --> 09:02:58.828
So you're getting plenty of work out your knees and all of your parts are working.

09:03:03.004 --> 09:03:04.185
so that we can thank them.

09:03:04.365 --> 09:03:10.850
And for those of you who are watching at home, and I know lots of you are, thank you to computer science panel members.

09:03:11.691 --> 09:03:20.218
I also want to recognize the Educator Excellence and Equity Division team who went above and beyond throughout this process to facilitate the development of the recommendations.

09:03:20.598 --> 09:03:25.042
And also to thank Melanie Murphy, Corwin of the IQC, who participated in the meetings.

09:03:25.582 --> 09:03:30.206
And of course, board member Williams for her continued support throughout the process.

09:03:33.263 --> 09:03:36.287
So next steps, we'll talk a little bit about where we go from here.

09:03:36.307 --> 09:03:47.142
The CDE plans to present the draft plan based on these recommendations to the Instructional Quality Commission Education Technology Committee later this month, two weeks from today.

09:03:48.623 --> 09:03:55.107
And we'll encourage the public to participate in a 30-day public review of the draft plan in both October and November.

09:03:55.727 --> 09:03:59.069
So we will have a draft plan based on these recommendations.

09:03:59.529 --> 09:04:04.211
I anticipate that it will be posted as part of the IQC agenda sometime in the next couple of days.

09:04:04.791 --> 09:04:08.573
We'll present that to the IQC and then put it out for public comment.

09:04:08.653 --> 09:04:11.955
Again, we're going to move it through the IQC because there's so much expertise.

09:04:12.015 --> 09:04:13.356
It's just fresh there right now.

09:04:13.736 --> 09:04:15.437
We want to make sure to leverage that.

09:04:16.758 --> 09:04:23.282
The CDE plans to present the Computer Science Strategic Implementation Plan to the board for potential adoption in March 2019.

09:04:23.842 --> 09:04:33.849
And if the plan is adopted by the board, the superintendent will present it to the legislature on or before July 15th, 2019.

09:04:36.230 --> 09:04:39.472
You'll be watching the live stream, won't you?

09:04:39.892 --> 09:04:41.073
Sue's thinking about July 2019.

09:04:47.449 --> 09:04:49.610
I remember Burr.

09:04:49.710 --> 09:04:50.691
I'm sorry it's very late.

09:04:50.951 --> 09:05:05.179
So, more information regarding the Computer Science Strategic Implementation Plan development process, including meeting agendas and a schedule of significant events, is available on the CDE Computer Science Strategic Implementation Plan webpage.

09:05:05.239 --> 09:05:08.421
The link is here on this screen.

09:05:09.082 --> 09:05:12.044
I am happy to entertain questions.

09:05:12.064 --> 09:05:14.245
Board Member Williams.

09:05:16.132 --> 09:05:28.399
When the standards committee was meeting, I was only able to attend one day of that because that was right after I had a major sports injury that required extensive surgery.

09:05:28.899 --> 09:05:31.280
So I didn't attend all the standards meetings.

09:05:32.241 --> 09:05:35.923
But I did attend every day of the strategic implementation committee.

09:05:37.243 --> 09:05:51.489
work six days and And I want to thank Pam for her support I don't think I mentioned Pam in the long list of staff before but she has been supporting me on computer science and she was there for all those meetings and Barb and Is it Melanie?

09:05:52.570 --> 09:06:01.296
Yeah, from IQC, and it was actually quite fun, in addition to being a great learning experience.

09:06:03.058 --> 09:06:05.740
It was interesting to watch Barb facilitate.

09:06:06.260 --> 09:06:18.069
I had never seen kind of a facilitation process exactly like that, but especially the ending of it when you were reaching consensus on what recommendations and had different cups that were going up and down.

09:06:18.449 --> 09:06:19.911
That was a new experience for me.

09:06:19.951 --> 09:06:21.772
I'd never done that or seen that.

09:06:23.153 --> 09:06:27.317
I feel like I've read, of course, the recommendations.

09:06:27.378 --> 09:06:36.046
I feel like they're very strong and cover all the stuff that needs to be covered and probably more than will ever get implemented.

09:06:36.106 --> 09:06:41.412
But it's going to be a great document that comes back to you in March.

09:06:42.352 --> 09:06:46.195
for adoption, for consideration of adoption as a plan.

09:06:46.475 --> 09:06:49.236
These recommendations today are just information item.

09:06:49.757 --> 09:06:59.843
CDE is taking these as we speak and turning them into a draft plan that will go to the IQC in three weeks, two weeks.

09:07:01.384 --> 09:07:07.408
for approval to send out for a 30-day public comment period in October and November.

09:07:08.249 --> 09:07:12.171
That the comment will come back to the IQC in January.

09:07:12.492 --> 09:07:16.795
They'll decide which comments that they want to include into the plan.

09:07:17.135 --> 09:07:21.998
It'll get finalized and it will come to you in March for consideration of adoption.

09:07:22.379 --> 09:07:26.622
If adopted, it will then go to the legislature and it has to be there by July 15th.

09:07:28.415 --> 09:07:31.236
2019.

09:07:29.316 --> 09:07:31.236
So I, let me finish.

09:07:31.677 --> 09:07:35.558
So, so I, I... Trying to get on the list.

09:07:36.639 --> 09:07:42.581
So I, I just want to say that I think the process went really well and that the group did really great work.

09:07:43.341 --> 09:07:46.123
They were a body of people, pretty high-powered people.

09:07:47.104 --> 09:07:52.307
They all had an interest in computer science, but didn't come from the same perspective and experience and background.

09:07:52.327 --> 09:07:56.910
And that always takes a while for people to kind of gel and start working together.

09:07:56.930 --> 09:08:01.954
And they did that, thanks to Barb, very quickly and did a great job with the recommendations.

09:08:02.674 --> 09:08:08.622
My only regret is that at this point, January is my last board meeting.

09:08:09.082 --> 09:08:13.468
And so I'm so happy that I was here for the standards adoption.

09:08:13.988 --> 09:08:17.553
I feel badly that I won't be here for

09:08:18.093 --> 09:08:23.939
seeing the plan when it comes in March unless something weird happens and I need to stay over for some reason.

09:08:24.619 --> 09:08:26.401
But otherwise, likely not.

09:08:26.461 --> 09:08:34.268
But I will be watching the live stream from home for this agenda item and cheering for its adoption.

09:08:37.071 --> 09:08:39.633
So, yeah, do we want to have public comment first?

09:08:39.653 --> 09:08:41.655
Yeah, let's have public comment.

09:08:43.134 --> 09:08:45.516
Will the following individuals please line up at the podium?

09:08:46.076 --> 09:08:52.781
David Miyashiro, Ed Hidalgo, Tamara Otero, Deborah Richardson, Brian Dworek.

09:08:56.112 --> 09:08:56.833
I'm David Miyashiro.

09:08:56.873 --> 09:09:01.697
I'm the superintendent of the Colon Valley School District and also President Kirst's appointee to co-chair this panel.

09:09:01.717 --> 09:09:04.119
I have to say, your meeting was thoroughly engaging.

09:09:05.120 --> 09:09:12.927
And honestly, listening to board members deliberate and talk and ask questions that are smart and thoughtful and listening and empathizing with people.

09:09:13.447 --> 09:09:16.290
We do two board meetings a week in my home district.

09:09:16.370 --> 09:09:17.531
It was refreshing to see.

09:09:18.352 --> 09:09:18.512
Yes.

09:09:20.382 --> 09:09:30.271
Anyways, thank you for your volunteerism and thank you for giving your time, especially those that you're currently teaching, leading, and being in leadership roles in current school districts.

09:09:30.372 --> 09:09:30.752
Thank you.

09:09:31.352 --> 09:09:35.176
I also want to acknowledge Kristen and your CDE staff and the gals from WestEd.

09:09:35.576 --> 09:09:37.518
Working with them was an absolute pleasure.

09:09:37.618 --> 09:09:38.659
They're like word ninjas.

09:09:38.739 --> 09:09:42.723
Everything that we said magically appeared in better form than we said it on paper.

09:09:43.564 --> 09:09:44.105
So thank you.

09:09:45.025 --> 09:09:49.667
Cajon Valley was actually the first school district to introduce computer science magnet schools in the country.

09:09:49.847 --> 09:09:51.047
We're pioneers in this space.

09:09:51.567 --> 09:09:55.549
I wrote each of you a letter, which I'll allude to tomorrow in general comments.

09:09:56.329 --> 09:10:05.792
But what I want to leave with you today is that what we're doing in terms of standards and the plan are the equivalent of adding chairs to the deck of the Titanic.

09:10:06.392 --> 09:10:10.654
And I'll expand on that tomorrow, but I'm concerned that we'll do more harm than good with this great work.

09:10:11.254 --> 09:10:11.834
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

09:10:17.588 --> 09:10:20.569
President Kirst and Board, my name is Ed Hidalgo.

09:10:20.609 --> 09:10:24.350
I'm a Chief Innovation and Engagement Officer for the Cajon Valley Union School District.

09:10:24.850 --> 09:10:28.391
I want to thank you for your work on the computer science standards for California.

09:10:29.131 --> 09:10:38.013
I'm sure that my former colleagues in staffing at Apple and Tesla and Qualcomm will be very happy that our state is committed to developing a pipeline of CS professionals.

09:10:38.753 --> 09:10:45.815
For 18 years, I worked in staffing for Manpower and Qualcomm, leading hiring teams that recruited talent, technical talent,

09:10:46.328 --> 09:10:48.012
globally for US-based work.

09:10:48.633 --> 09:10:50.798
Thousands of workers bleed for the United States.

09:10:51.994 --> 09:10:53.075
The need is real.

09:10:53.235 --> 09:10:55.656
The work that you're doing here is critically important.

09:10:56.357 --> 09:11:00.199
But I'm now an innovation lead for a public school district in Southern California.

09:11:00.720 --> 09:11:02.041
I bring a couple of thoughts today.

09:11:02.721 --> 09:11:06.444
The current system is not preparing all students for the world of work.

09:11:07.044 --> 09:11:14.629
As much as it is about what we are not providing students, it's also about what we are not taking off the plates of students and teachers.

09:11:15.129 --> 09:11:21.434
We can't add computer science as a requirement and not consider education requirements that are no longer relevant.

09:11:22.234 --> 09:11:26.695
It's time to redesign a system that is no longer relevant to a 21st century world of work.

09:11:27.175 --> 09:11:27.515
Thank you.

09:11:33.497 --> 09:11:34.017
Good evening.

09:11:34.117 --> 09:11:35.997
Thank you for hearing us again this evening.

09:11:36.777 --> 09:11:40.838
My name is Tamara Otero and I'm the president of the San Diego County School Board Association.

09:11:41.278 --> 09:11:45.619
I'm also a trustee in Cajon Valley Union School District and I admire your tenacity.

09:11:45.939 --> 09:11:47.800
Our board meetings have never ran quite this long.

09:11:49.361 --> 09:11:51.383
Thank you to your commitment for education.

09:11:51.583 --> 09:11:53.645
I greatly respect the work that you're doing here.

09:11:54.165 --> 09:11:59.671
I champion the fact that California is taking the initiative to move to the 21st century with computer science standards.

09:12:00.271 --> 09:12:03.054
It will serve all students well as it has in my district.

09:12:03.575 --> 09:12:11.403
I do wonder though why the state continues to add one more thing without stopping to first assess the current system of requirements on LEAs and on our students.

09:12:12.003 --> 09:12:15.245
We continue to develop new ways to measure old practices.

09:12:15.846 --> 09:12:21.770
Why not create new practices that have built-in growth measures and build relevance into the learning processes?

09:12:22.370 --> 09:12:35.620
Recent results from Gallup state that the most important indicators of success in K-12 education include high graduation rates, engaged cultures, and students who are hopeful about the future.

09:12:36.775 --> 09:12:38.837
Today is what we have to make tomorrow better.

09:12:39.137 --> 09:12:43.160
The example of revised successful education practices are available around the world.

09:12:43.621 --> 09:12:45.943
We are not leading the nation in education.

09:12:46.023 --> 09:12:46.323
Time.

09:12:46.523 --> 09:12:51.167
And while CS standards are exciting, it's time to get to work on the entire framework.

09:12:51.628 --> 09:12:51.948
Thank you.

09:12:57.580 --> 09:12:58.821
Hi, Deborah Richardson again.

09:12:58.841 --> 09:13:02.122
And happy, I think I might make my plane home.

09:13:02.943 --> 09:13:03.243
Maybe.

09:13:04.424 --> 09:13:11.747
As you know, I served as the co-chair of this panel, and I wanted to thank Superintendent Torlakson for appointing me to that important position.

09:13:12.468 --> 09:13:19.652
I already spoke about how important computer science is for all of California's students, and that was really part of the recommendations that we wrote.

09:13:20.632 --> 09:13:26.738
In particular, California needs to focus on increasing the participation of traditionally underrepresented groups in computer science.

09:13:27.338 --> 09:13:33.303
Girls, students of color, students from low socioeconomic backgrounds, as well as rural and urban students.

09:13:35.025 --> 09:13:40.590
This requires broadening the pool of teachers at all levels from kindergarten through 12th grade across the state.

09:13:41.250 --> 09:13:51.318
and providing them with the professional learning opportunities and resources they need to learn and teach rigorous and relevant computer science that's aligned with the standards that you've just approved.

09:13:51.378 --> 09:13:52.019
Thank you for that.

09:13:53.580 --> 09:14:02.747
This is just an informational item, so I want to urge you to look over the recommendations that we made and be ready for the plan that comes forward in March.

09:14:02.947 --> 09:14:05.149
And I would urge you to support that plan as well.

09:14:05.269 --> 09:14:08.071
And thanks again for your support of Computer Science for California.

09:14:11.991 --> 09:14:13.893
Hi, I'm Brian Twerk from SFUSD.

09:14:14.434 --> 09:14:15.735
Thanks for adopting those standards.

09:14:16.076 --> 09:14:16.796
That's exciting.

09:14:17.797 --> 09:14:21.141
I also want to urge you to consider the recommendations put forth by this panel.

09:14:21.301 --> 09:14:25.045
It's an incredible group of individuals who have diverse perspectives.

09:14:25.166 --> 09:14:29.290
And I represent a district who's already prioritizing computer science education.

09:14:29.490 --> 09:14:33.174
And that's manifested by me having a position dedicated to computer science education.

09:14:33.835 --> 09:14:44.819
I want to note that as a panel we considered all the districts and schools that don't have people dedicated to that and we considered how to make this possible by considering the system as a whole.

09:14:45.399 --> 09:14:53.122
And so the recommendations outline how this complex system can work to support the implementation of those standards and the support of our educators.

09:14:53.142 --> 09:14:54.122
I want to thank you for that.

09:14:56.143 --> 09:14:58.023
Okay, board member comments on this item.

09:14:58.364 --> 09:14:59.004
Board member Burr.

09:15:00.650 --> 09:15:17.102
So I really appreciate all the enthusiasm and the hard work that's gone on, but I'm conflicted here because I thought when we adopted the standards they were meant to be voluntary and suggestions for what might happen in LEAs in order to promote computer science.

09:15:17.822 --> 09:15:27.209
When I read these recommendations, and I recognize they're just recommendations, it reads like one big wish list for what every content teacher would want.

09:15:28.058 --> 09:15:34.341
and potentially the recreation of every categorical program we've ever had in California.

09:15:35.501 --> 09:15:36.362
So two things.

09:15:36.482 --> 09:15:39.723
I hope as they go out for comment, people will think about that.

09:15:39.743 --> 09:15:46.406
And I think a little bit of the feedback that we were getting reflected that too, of we're just piling on, piling on.

09:15:47.006 --> 09:15:55.668
and potentially creating a really big funding requirement or pushing for one, that we think about that in the comments.

09:15:56.108 --> 09:16:01.370
And just specifically, Barb, you and I always have these comments, conversations about the fiscal analysis.

09:16:01.930 --> 09:16:13.393
If you look at the item, the fiscal analysis says what the cost of the plan is, which is $261,000, which I'm sure is not even close to what it would cost us to implement this.

09:16:14.233 --> 09:16:34.920
So when we go forward, I know that it was very narrowly focused, but I really think if you're asking the board seriously to adopt a plan for loan forgiveness, teacher training, professional development, you name it, adding a graduation requirement course, that's millions and millions of dollars.

09:16:35.140 --> 09:16:41.962
So we need to be very clear about that so that what people are voting on, their eyes are wide open.

09:16:42.694 --> 09:16:42.955
Thanks.

09:16:43.176 --> 09:16:44.341
Thank you for that feedback.

09:16:45.968 --> 09:16:46.691
Patricia Rocker.

09:16:48.186 --> 09:16:55.489
Well, I appreciate board member Burr opening the door on that conversation because that's also the direction my comments are going to go.

09:16:56.029 --> 09:17:03.512
And I suspect having read the letter that's coming from our co-chair, you and I are a lot closer and on the same page and you may realize.

09:17:03.892 --> 09:17:13.596
I want to say that when I was still a classroom teacher, I was hired as a computer resource teacher and that was in the days before we had this plan, before we had standards.

09:17:14.673 --> 09:17:17.396
concerning instruction in the K-12 classrooms.

09:17:17.756 --> 09:17:31.509
I also worked at Sac State in the teacher education department, and I taught that one class that was required for teachers to get their credential concerning the use of computer-based instruction in their classroom.

09:17:31.889 --> 09:17:36.413
So a lot of the things that are addressed in the standards were addressed in that class.

09:17:37.594 --> 09:17:58.584
But a lot of the work that I did with my colleagues, not only in my school, but in schools around the district where we would sit together and figure out what we were doing and how we were trying to go about doing this and making decisions on everything from hardware to the types of software experience, software that would be adopted or considered, as well as what the instruction would look like.

09:17:59.225 --> 09:18:03.747
Though if this plan had been in place, first of all, I probably would have been happy

09:18:04.167 --> 09:18:11.389
because I would know that there would be some uniformity not only in our district, but across our county on the type of work we were doing.

09:18:11.909 --> 09:18:23.872
But at the same time, the standards that we're adopting are voluntary, which meant I still had the flexibility not only to decide what I was going to be doing in my classroom as a teacher,

09:18:24.352 --> 09:18:36.924
but also some flexibility to work with those credential candidates to help them understand how to make instructionally appropriate decisions about appropriate use and activities for computers in their classroom.

09:18:37.565 --> 09:18:41.008
This plan takes us down a different pathway

09:18:41.388 --> 09:18:59.735
because we move from voluntary use and implementation of the standards to something that is a much larger type of infrastructure that would be created by the state and that would do more for the profession and in the classrooms about the implementation and use of these standards.

09:18:59.755 --> 09:19:03.656
So I have great concern about what this plan is asking us to do.

09:19:04.237 --> 09:19:10.599
And seeing it for this very first time, I have a lot of questions that we frankly don't have enough time

09:19:10.899 --> 09:19:12.941
to talk about and ask about today.

09:19:13.322 --> 09:19:29.179
So I know that this was only intended to be an information item, but I am taken aback by so many things that I read and what I saw in what's being presented today that I know in March, if you think we took a lot of time on item one today,

09:19:31.281 --> 09:19:45.918
I just want you to know you have presented information and now you're going to give me one, two, three, six months to talk, think about all the questions that I'm going to want to ask and all the concerns that I'm going to want to raise and you know I know how to do that.

09:19:46.418 --> 09:19:51.880
So, I have some concerns about the direction the plan suggested we should take.

09:19:52.440 --> 09:20:11.367
If I were still a classroom teacher, if I was still in that classroom teaching those students as a computer resource teacher in my district, if I was still a lecturer at CSU Sacramento, I frankly would tell you I'd have to come here and raise some very serious concerns about what this plan is suggesting that what we should be doing.

09:20:11.727 --> 09:20:22.309
not only to prepare our profession for certification and for using these standards, but also for what it means for classroom teachers to do this as an instructional decision in their classroom.

09:20:23.809 --> 09:20:25.109
Can I respond just a bit?

09:20:25.390 --> 09:20:33.471
I tried to set this foundation early on because, again, the statute is pretty detailed and it is a two-part process.

09:20:34.031 --> 09:20:37.312
The first part of the statute required in paneling 23 experts

09:20:39.728 --> 09:20:43.569
expertise in computer science to put forth a set of recommendations.

09:20:44.110 --> 09:20:46.130
And that's what we have today in this item.

09:20:46.150 --> 09:20:49.511
What you have today in the item, item 8, is not a plan.

09:20:50.472 --> 09:21:00.295
Item 8 is a set of recommendations put forth by a panel of 23 experts that the department, the superintendent, will take and turn into a plan

09:21:01.778 --> 09:21:06.261
something for which I have a little experience.

09:21:06.621 --> 09:21:09.582
So I hear your concerns.

09:21:09.623 --> 09:21:20.889
I appreciate you sharing the concerns, but I think it's really important for us to differentiate between the set of recommendations that you have before you now, which does have a pretty high price tag.

09:21:22.506 --> 09:21:26.850
But that was the cost of pulling together the set of recommendations and pulling people, right?

09:21:27.190 --> 09:21:30.453
Versus the plan for supporting computer science.

09:21:30.513 --> 09:21:31.314
Let me be clear.

09:21:31.534 --> 09:21:36.378
I am not confused by what was presented to us today.

09:21:37.038 --> 09:21:42.003
But I do know that what was presented to us today is going to inform that plan.

09:21:42.663 --> 09:21:49.489
is going to create, it will be the construction of many of the foundational elements that we are going to see in that plan.

09:21:49.950 --> 09:21:56.516
So, the purpose of today was only information, so we're not going to get to talk about those foundational elements.

09:21:56.556 --> 09:22:02.001
We're not even going to get a chance to talk about as a board how the decision will be made about

09:22:02.541 --> 09:22:05.703
How these recommendations are going to inform the plan.

09:22:05.743 --> 09:22:14.789
We're going to hear, we just got to see the recommendations and the next time we see it, we'll be taking action on some plan that's constructed.

09:22:15.169 --> 09:22:17.251
You won't necessarily be taking action in March.

09:22:17.771 --> 09:22:20.253
We want to bring a draft plan to you in March.

09:22:21.033 --> 09:22:24.375
so that you will have plenty of time to discuss that draft plan in March.

09:22:24.775 --> 09:22:42.046
We are not required... I think my point is between now and the time we see something in March, there are going to be a lot of intervening conversations about what was presented today that I don't see where I will have an opportunity to give some, to express some concerns or give some feedback.

09:22:42.267 --> 09:22:44.468
I think that's the point I'm trying to make.

09:22:47.148 --> 09:22:48.409
Okay, Board Member Valdez.

09:22:48.629 --> 09:22:52.690
Just to piggyback on that, so what's the process between now and when you bring a plan?

09:22:52.750 --> 09:22:54.351
Who helps build that plan?

09:22:54.411 --> 09:22:55.671
I guess that's just my question.

09:22:55.691 --> 09:22:56.672
Thank you for that question.

09:22:56.792 --> 09:23:02.814
So we will bring a draft plan to the IQC on September 20th.

09:23:03.014 --> 09:23:05.015
They're having a meeting the 20th and 21st.

09:23:05.075 --> 09:23:08.376
We're going to present it to the Educational Technology Committee.

09:23:09.156 --> 09:23:10.217
and ask them.

09:23:10.397 --> 09:23:11.318
We'll review it with them.

09:23:11.358 --> 09:23:14.560
We'll get some more public comment there, maybe some preliminary comment from them.

09:23:14.881 --> 09:23:19.404
But then we're going to go out for a 30-day public comment process in October and November.

09:23:19.885 --> 09:23:27.891
We're going to collect the public comment on the draft plan, which is a bit different from the set of recommendations that you have before you today.

09:23:29.161 --> 09:23:48.742
bring that public comment back to the IQC in January, they will have the opportunity to weigh in on the public comment and provide guidance to department staff around what changes ought to be made, which of those pieces of feedback as we do with frameworks and other things that we bring to the board as we did with the standards today.

09:23:50.054 --> 09:23:58.646
And then in March, the IQC and the department will present a draft plan to the board for potential adoption.

09:23:58.666 --> 09:24:03.712
In my experience, the first time you bring a plan to the board is not the last time you bring the plan to the board.

09:24:05.515 --> 09:24:09.218
Because the board needs to discuss the plan and provide feedback.

09:24:09.578 --> 09:24:12.181
There will be additional public comments at the March meeting.

09:24:12.641 --> 09:24:13.262
It could happen.

09:24:13.302 --> 09:24:14.984
It could be adopted in March 2019.

09:24:15.504 --> 09:24:21.950
But we gave ourself enough leeway to bring it back again in May and potentially back again in July.

09:24:22.471 --> 09:24:27.195
So we created this timeline for plan development.

09:24:27.836 --> 09:24:29.857
that provides plenty of opportunities.

09:24:30.297 --> 09:24:42.684
Today was meeting statutory requirements to impanel 23 people to inform a plan because there's a lot of computer science expertise in California that doesn't necessarily all live here in the department, right?

09:24:42.744 --> 09:24:45.345
So we're bringing the, that's what you saw today.

09:24:45.465 --> 09:24:46.626
Today is not a plan.

09:24:46.666 --> 09:24:55.611
Today is recommendations to inform a plan that will have a months long process and many opportunities for board members to weigh in.

09:24:57.470 --> 09:24:59.232
Okay, you wanted to continue.

09:24:59.292 --> 09:24:59.512
Yeah.

09:25:00.072 --> 09:25:05.837
So with that, I think and I'm hearing the concern of the district and being an assistant superintendent in a large district, I understand the concern.

09:25:06.218 --> 09:25:11.662
And I think the overall overarching theme is if everything is important, then nothing is important.

09:25:11.702 --> 09:25:15.325
And that's, I think, what the voices I'm hearing today are asking.

09:25:15.385 --> 09:25:17.347
How do we refine, integrate?

09:25:17.367 --> 09:25:21.170
I mean, we've truly talked about an integrated system of curriculum.

09:25:21.230 --> 09:25:23.292
And so when could that happen?

09:25:23.812 --> 09:25:26.154
I think that's just one thing on the horizon.

09:25:28.783 --> 09:25:31.125
Board Member Williams.

09:25:31.945 --> 09:25:33.706
A couple of things that relate to this.

09:25:34.387 --> 09:25:55.981
One thing is that one item in the state board guidance to the standards committee was to provide substantive guidance while allowing for flexibility and innovation across LEAs to determine from a variety of approaches how to best incorporate computer science into their curricula based on local capacity and context.

09:25:57.201 --> 09:26:03.543
That was written clearly to be saying these are model standards and substantive guidance, not a new requirement.

09:26:04.203 --> 09:26:14.346
And it's been clear all along with, or at least when I'm available, I've tried to make it clear that there's no plan for a curriculum framework

09:26:15.026 --> 09:26:21.011
which Brian addressed by saying he knew that there wasn't a plan for a curriculum framework.

09:26:21.071 --> 09:26:33.342
So in the standards, they built in examples of how various computer science practices could be integrated because they knew there weren't going to be a curriculum framework and no plan for a state summative assessment.

09:26:34.002 --> 09:26:40.588
Now, all that said, that was pretty, you know, I say that every time to everyone.

09:26:41.689 --> 09:26:59.043
But you also had, for this panel, you had a lot of expertise in computer science and a large contingent of really strong advocates for expanding computer science and expanding it equitably.

09:27:00.184 --> 09:27:08.710
And so what I would say that what you have for recommendations is a really well done wish list.

09:27:09.351 --> 09:27:21.759
So if you were going, you know, if we could dream from the advocacy standpoint, if we could dream of what it would look like if it was all through California and done really well, here's all the policy levers.

09:27:24.821 --> 09:27:30.005
funding, you know, dedicated funding, this, that, that could make that happen.

09:27:30.425 --> 09:27:42.235
So if you think of it that way, they developed a really robust and smart list of all the possible things that could be done to help advance computer science.

09:27:43.075 --> 09:27:48.076
One question I have is what it means, how to interpret.

09:27:48.636 --> 09:27:52.617
The statute says that it goes to the board for adoption.

09:27:52.877 --> 09:27:55.677
And if adopted, it goes to the legislature.

09:27:56.418 --> 09:27:58.798
So in two things I want to raise.

09:27:59.098 --> 09:28:02.939
One is it goes to the legislature, which means it goes to them as a wish list.

09:28:03.419 --> 09:28:08.820
It goes to them, whatever's in it by the time it goes to them is here's some things that could make a difference.

09:28:09.620 --> 09:28:20.805
But I also want to ask, encourage us to ask ourselves, what does it, what does it convey when the, if the board adopts it, the plan?

09:28:21.865 --> 09:28:29.588
Does it sound, is that going to be interpreted by the legislature that we endorse every single item that's in it as a recommendation?

09:28:30.148 --> 09:28:33.310
Or is that, because if that's the case,

09:28:34.470 --> 09:28:37.974
you know, that would, you know, you would start pruning.

09:28:38.914 --> 09:28:49.264
If it's more, we think this is a really good set of recommendations, you know, do with it, legislature and governor, what you, you know, pick the ones you think are most effective and that you want to support.

09:28:49.804 --> 09:28:53.207
then you wouldn't have to worry about the kind of pruning you did.

09:28:53.487 --> 09:29:05.817
But that is what the questions that you're raising about how comprehensive it is and what that cost would be and the implications of that for all the other standards we have, which, you know,

09:29:06.698 --> 09:29:10.221
I mean, you know, I'm worried about NGSS standards.

09:29:10.241 --> 09:29:13.644
So, you know, it also needs some extra support.

09:29:13.844 --> 09:29:16.045
So that's, so those are two things I would just say.

09:29:16.105 --> 09:29:23.571
Think of this as this really smart panel's list, wish list of all the things that could be done to advance this agenda.

09:29:24.152 --> 09:29:31.277
But then the board needs to decide what does it mean if we adopt it to go over to the legislature?

09:29:31.357 --> 09:29:32.899
How would that be interpreted?

09:29:33.639 --> 09:29:40.144
and make sure that it's getting interpreted the way you want it to or that it has in it the things that you feel comfortable with.

09:29:40.724 --> 09:29:50.351
If I may, to your point, the difference between the NGSS standards and the computer science standards, the computer science standards are voluntary.

09:29:50.791 --> 09:29:56.755
And so looking at those recommendations, we just can't simply say yes and pass them on to the legislature.

09:29:57.076 --> 09:30:02.880
There needs to be not only this plan for the work that's going to be going on going for

09:30:03.260 --> 09:30:10.575
There needs to be some plan for how we as a policy body vet those recommendations and pass them over to the legislature.

09:30:10.635 --> 09:30:12.218
So, I have concerns.

09:30:18.991 --> 09:30:23.312
Can I suggest we, you know, we'll have another shot at this and it's a long day.

09:30:24.253 --> 09:30:26.794
Maybe we could continue this in the future.

09:30:26.814 --> 09:30:28.414
All right.

09:30:29.094 --> 09:30:38.958
With that, I want to announce that the item 18 and the Imagine School proposal has been pulled from our agenda by the Imagine Charter School people.

09:30:39.758 --> 09:30:46.260
And we'll do the state board priorities tomorrow, Friday.

09:30:47.140 --> 09:30:50.825
And the board is now in continuation state.

09:30:51.686 --> 09:30:58.955
We will continue the meeting tomorrow with our executive session to begin.

09:30:59.284 --> 09:31:02.606
Mike, can you please announce the two cases for the executive session?

09:31:03.706 --> 09:31:05.167
Oh, OK.

09:31:05.727 --> 09:31:11.810
OK, our two cases are CAP EEM versus the state.

09:31:12.630 --> 09:31:23.215
And the second case is options for youth, Burbank versus Education Audits Appeal Panel, CDE, SBE, State of California.

09:31:23.655 --> 09:31:29.058
So the board will consider those in closed session tomorrow when we continue our meeting in the morning.

09:31:30.521 --> 09:31:33.186
So we've lost Deborah because she had to catch a flight.

09:31:33.326 --> 09:31:39.275
But Dean and Brian and David, if you guys want to take a photo with the resolution, then let's go do it now.
