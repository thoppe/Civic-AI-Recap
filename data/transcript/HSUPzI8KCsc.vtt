00:02.765 --> 00:04.186
Good morning, Mr. President and board members.

00:05.586 --> 00:12.469
Good to be able to report another active couple of months, and I'm gonna highlight three visits I had to schools.

00:12.509 --> 00:21.012
Those are the most inspiring parts of our work, I think, is to go see students on the front line, excited, thrilled to learn, thrilled to be there, and teachers teaching their hearts out.

00:21.612 --> 00:28.615
The first of the schools I visited was Jenny Oropeza Elementary School by invitation of board member Ortiz Lacan.

00:28.695 --> 00:31.856
Her husband, Roberto Lacan, teaches fifth grade there.

00:32.845 --> 00:39.311
And it was fascinating, they have incredibly strong parent involvement and partnership with the YMCA.

00:40.032 --> 00:50.162
The head of that organization and partnership actually recognized our board member as being a former counselor for the program.

00:50.683 --> 00:54.626
And he said she came a long way, which is great.

00:56.248 --> 01:03.612
So they have a youth leadership institute, and again, strong partnerships with the community and parent groups.

01:04.772 --> 01:07.794
The second to highlight, I had a chance to go to Pittsburgh.

01:08.889 --> 01:14.652
Visited three Head Start programs, and of course seeing the little ones just eager, exploring the world, full of energy.

01:16.493 --> 01:32.160
Then I visited Los Madonos Elementary School, where they had a special assembly, and a large number of parents, I would say over 100 parents and grandparents and nieces and nephews came for a celebration on the overall performance of all students on the Smarter Balance.

01:32.760 --> 01:44.485
and then they had medals to hand out, and I got to place medals around the necks of about 200 students for meeting or exceeding the standards.

01:45.005 --> 01:54.149
So it was a celebration of accomplishment and looking at all groups, including those that were moving up, who were below the meeting standards expectation.

01:55.230 --> 01:57.731
The third visit I took was to Elk Grove.

01:58.980 --> 02:01.022
Among many, I wanted to highlight these three.

02:01.142 --> 02:05.807
At Dreen Elementary School in Elk Grove, I'd heard about their super high attendance.

02:06.828 --> 02:14.535
They set a record high attendance of 98%, and that's the top for all 65 schools in the Elk Grove Unified School District.

02:15.356 --> 02:22.865
And we had an assembly there as well, and they chant regularly, every day, all day, on time.

02:23.085 --> 02:24.187
And then they fly flags.

02:24.267 --> 02:25.869
Every classroom has a flag.

02:26.410 --> 02:31.116
If they've had a perfect attendance the day before, they fly a flag and celebrate attendance.

02:32.096 --> 02:34.418
So we know that that makes a huge difference.

02:34.438 --> 02:39.882
You've got to be there to enjoy the great skills of the teachers and the wonderful facilities.

02:39.942 --> 02:45.826
And so parents there really put a high priority in getting their kids to school on time every day.

02:46.967 --> 02:49.128
It's part of an ongoing effort.

02:49.148 --> 02:53.512
We're going to actually expand our efforts to increase attendance.

02:53.912 --> 03:00.877
We have $27 million in grants to school districts for programs to reduce high rates of chronic absenteeism

03:01.940 --> 03:04.724
out-of-school suspension, dropouts, and crime.

03:05.124 --> 03:11.091
The department is already putting the guidelines together for this $27 million in grants to tackle attendance challenges.

03:11.752 --> 03:19.842
I want to thank Assemblymember Patrick O'Donnell from Long Beach who authored AB 2815, which promotes effective attendance practices.

03:20.923 --> 03:30.209
Nine million of the grant fund will come from Prop 47, a voter approved initiative that reduced prison time for some nonviolent crimes and allocate savings to school programs.

03:31.129 --> 03:34.451
And the governor approved an additional 18 million in the state budget.

03:35.291 --> 03:47.819
Districts can hire more social workers, counselors, nurses to identify and expand efforts to increase attendance as those defined as at risk for not being there on a regular basis.

03:48.739 --> 03:50.801
I also wanted to share a grant program.

03:50.821 --> 03:52.803
It's called New Skills for Youth Grant.

03:52.823 --> 04:04.973
I'm excited that we have received a $100,000 planning grant and that a team from CDE just went back to Washington to promote getting a phase two grant.

04:05.533 --> 04:17.023
It's an effort partnership between the Council of Chief State School Officers and Advance CTE, a national nonprofit that represents career technical education and JPMorgan Chase.

04:17.824 --> 04:26.213
So it tracks very well with the work we've done in California, this building on the work of our career incentive grants and career pathways.

04:29.517 --> 04:36.745
I wanted to just recognize Joe Ratting and Donna Wyatt if they're here for their work heading up the California team that made the presentation.

04:39.783 --> 04:49.065
This time I'll turn it over to Glenn just to give a brief comment on the Collaboration in Common grant, another grant that we're lucky to have within reach.

04:50.645 --> 04:52.485
Thank you, Superintendent Torlakson.

04:53.065 --> 04:53.866
Is this mic on?

04:53.886 --> 04:54.806
Great.

04:55.306 --> 05:07.988
So we've had the opportunity a couple times to reference this effort, Collaboration in Common, which has been a public-private partnership that the California Department of Education is undertaking in conjunction with the CDE Foundation.

05:08.808 --> 05:29.441
And we also had the opportunity back in October, well October already seems like a long time ago, and we are November 2nd, to review briefly the use of collaboration in common with the California Practitioners Advisory Group in relationship to the expanded statements of model practice work that we're putting together and the curation of resources for that.

05:30.221 --> 05:42.906
But wanted to announce that as of today, educators around the state who have signed up as early adopters of Collaboration in Common are starting to use the platform, starting to kick the tires and make it real.

05:43.526 --> 05:47.868
And then additionally, in some very exciting news, we wanted to announce today that the

05:48.508 --> 06:07.782
Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is making a $2.25 million grant to the CDE Foundation to expand the resource, particularly in relationship to promoting collaboration amongst education communities in the state of California, and will really help us expand the platform and get out the word around collaboration in common.

06:07.822 --> 06:11.684
So I wanted to share that exciting news and also issue a call to action.

06:11.704 --> 06:15.127
If there's anyone else who would like to sign up as an early adopter,

06:15.587 --> 06:23.369
of Collaboration in Common, please go to collaborationincommon.org, just like it sounds, and sign up, and we'll be happy to see you there.

06:23.629 --> 06:25.369
So back to you, Superintendent Tarleson.

06:25.389 --> 06:37.712
Again, thought that would be good news to share and just fresh news, as it were, and again, great work on the staff team that helped put this together and worked and interacted with your team here, President Kerst.

06:38.032 --> 06:44.334
And I'll just wrap with saying that I'm looking for some magic numbers to get green lights and bring in some green.

06:44.774 --> 07:03.138
That's 51, 55, 56, and 58, which are ballot measures which I strongly support and believe that given the debate on them, we will hopefully see green lights on those measures and more financial stability and enhancement of our programs in our schools.

07:03.718 --> 07:05.199
So with that, Mr. President, thank you.

07:10.655 --> 07:10.980
So.

07:25.130 --> 07:36.855
Spanish interpreter services will be available for items 3, 4, and 5 on Wednesday, and on Thursday, items 18, 19, and 20.

07:36.975 --> 07:44.878
There are four public hearings, item 9, science framework, and the three charter petitions, items 18, 19, and 20.

07:48.120 --> 07:54.286
There are three addenda to the agenda, which was published in advance.

07:55.026 --> 08:08.739
The recommendations of the three finalists, the student report and recommendations from the Student Advisory Board on Education, and item eight, the Screening Committee's recommendations for appointments to our advisory commissions.

08:10.280 --> 08:13.821
The consent calendars is there.

08:13.922 --> 08:21.344
It's items 11 through 17 will be on consent, and there's a handout on the table in the lobby listing these.

08:22.565 --> 08:27.386
The proposed regular consent items, as I indicated, are 11 through 17.

08:28.266 --> 08:32.168
The waiver consent items are W1 through W8.

08:32.688 --> 08:37.930
As I indicated, W9 was withdrawn by Tehachapi's Unified School District.

08:39.271 --> 08:51.064
If you want to take up board members, any waiver consent items and regular consent items and put those on their agenda, please advise Karen staff Walters by the end of today, Wednesday.

08:57.048 --> 09:08.392
today, we will be using one minute per speaker for all items and tomorrow, but they can bundle where you can have five members and, uh, five speakers and then take three minutes.

09:09.352 --> 09:15.755
Uh, we, uh, provide at least 25 copies of anything.

09:15.835 --> 09:18.816
So if you want to submit any materials to the board, bring 25 copies.

09:20.736 --> 09:21.696
speakers, please.

09:21.857 --> 09:25.898
Whenever you speak, introduce yourself and the organization that you represent.

09:27.158 --> 09:33.500
Gravity and speaking will be appreciated and additional seating is there for the TV monitors.

09:34.340 --> 09:49.025
So with those in tow and announcements done, we're now ready for agenda item one and the state Board of Education student member recommendations for the finalists who will be handling this member Burr will be handling this.

09:59.411 --> 10:00.012
Good morning.

10:01.034 --> 10:06.783
It's a pleasure to be with you here this morning.

10:07.384 --> 10:09.828
This is the most exciting time of the year for us.

10:12.924 --> 10:13.805
Now, how about that?

10:14.285 --> 10:15.306
Better, okay.

10:16.206 --> 10:18.007
Red means that it's on.

10:18.628 --> 10:20.209
I thought it was green.

10:20.869 --> 10:23.311
Again, nice to be here this morning.

10:23.491 --> 10:31.737
This is the most gratifying time of the year for the screening committee, when we get to engage in the selection and our recommendations for our student board member.

10:33.538 --> 10:42.484
I'll just say that it's always so thrilling to have a chance to talk to these young people, to see their enthusiasm and their commitment and their passionate

10:43.965 --> 10:56.155
Wanting to be on the State Board of Education, I can just say that we're all in great hands and you'll see that when you get to experience the student members that we've had in the past and certainly the one we have now with Olivia Sisson.

10:56.856 --> 11:02.341
Just a little refresher of how this process works before we acknowledge all of the students who participated in it.

11:03.261 --> 11:11.426
The screening committee, which consists of member Holliday and member Ortiz-Lincoln and myself, get the entire package of applications.

11:11.787 --> 11:14.769
We narrow it down to 12 semi-finalists.

11:15.609 --> 11:21.173
Then those 12 are interviewed by the student council organization.

11:21.933 --> 11:34.367
And they narrow it down to six people who then the screening committee interviews, and our job is to identify three candidates to move forward to the governor, and the governor actually makes the appointment.

11:35.686 --> 11:43.009
So what I'd like to do today is acknowledge all of the semifinalists, and we will close with the three finalists that we're recommending.

11:44.190 --> 11:48.111
So the first semifinalist, I want to make sure that I acknowledge their schools as well.

11:48.192 --> 11:58.196
And if you would come up, we have a certificate for you, which I'd be happy to present to you, is Ryan Chen from La Canata High School in Los Angeles County.

12:09.529 --> 12:16.916
The next semifinalist that's shown on your addendum is not able to join us today, and that's Deborah Assayas-Gatta.

12:17.396 --> 12:20.719
She's from Robert F. Kennedy Community Schools in Los Angeles.

12:21.660 --> 12:27.365
So our next semifinalist who is here is Ren Li from Stockdale High School in Kern County.

12:38.960 --> 12:46.287
Our next semifinalist is Julissa Lopez Vega from Owens Gilroy Early College Academy in Santa Clara County.

12:56.217 --> 13:03.144
Next is Thuy Van Nguyen from Monterey Trail High School in Elk Grove in Sacramento County.

13:12.771 --> 13:15.493
And the last semifinalist is Chloe Perath.

13:15.694 --> 13:25.282
Chloe is from the Abel Charter, Humphreys College Academy of Business Law and Education, New Jerusalem Elementary School District, San Joaquin County.

13:37.737 --> 13:43.202
This next group of individuals are the candidates who were forwarded, and we had the pleasure to interview them.

13:43.922 --> 13:46.424
I should just say these are always really hard decisions.

13:46.464 --> 13:52.049
These are very able students, very, very capable, and we're just thrilled to have them.

13:52.670 --> 14:00.076
So first, I'd like to acknowledge Ardith Chavez from Western Sierra Collegiate Academy in Rockland, Placer County.

14:08.619 --> 14:10.061
Next is Lydia Chun.

14:10.321 --> 14:15.605
Lydia goes to John Marshall High School in Los Angeles Unified School District, Los Angeles County.

14:23.012 --> 14:25.474
And the next one is John John Huddleston.

14:25.634 --> 14:30.439
John John goes to North Hollywood Highly Gifted Magnet in Los Angeles County.

14:37.535 --> 14:47.285
Okay, and these are the three finalists who we will be, once we acknowledge them, we'll be making a motion to forward their applicants to the governor for consideration.

14:47.885 --> 14:50.028
And first we have Jayden Gray.

14:51.029 --> 14:57.075
Jayden is a student at James Logan High School, New Haven Unified School District, Alameda County.

15:06.582 --> 15:08.363
Next is Madison Laster.

15:08.483 --> 15:12.986
Madison goes to Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach, Los Angeles County.

15:20.690 --> 15:26.454
And our last finalist is Steven Pineda who goes to University Senior High School in Los Angeles.

15:34.577 --> 15:46.143
And with that, I would like to move that we forward the three finalists who are listed on your addendum to Governor Brown for his consideration for appointment for the student member of the State Board of Education.

15:46.163 --> 15:46.924
Second.

15:48.225 --> 15:49.605
Okay, it's been moved and seconded.

15:49.926 --> 15:51.166
Is there any board discussion?

15:52.507 --> 15:54.848
Seeing none, any public comment on this item?

15:55.228 --> 15:55.329
No.

15:55.369 --> 15:58.830
All right, all those in favor, raise your hands.

16:00.151 --> 16:01.092
The motion carries.

16:01.132 --> 16:03.033
Congratulations to the three finalists.

16:11.565 --> 16:19.907
Okay, we're now ready for item two and Bruce Holliday will lead off on this item.

16:28.387 --> 16:43.114
Over the past few years in this room we've spoken a lot about LCFF and rubrics and LCAPS and accountability systems and yet every discussion we've always continually stressed the importance of student voice in all decision making.

16:44.314 --> 16:49.075
We've also created pathways for student voice to be heard at the local level as well as at state level.

16:49.115 --> 17:03.158
And I can assure you that when you hear these student presentations this morning, as I had the privilege to preview them last night, that you will be inspired and reminded that when students join the conversation, everyone benefits.

17:03.698 --> 17:09.979
These are passionate and committed young people who embody the spirit and the excellence of education in California.

17:15.563 --> 17:16.324
Okay, go ahead.

17:22.708 --> 17:23.188
Good morning.

17:39.198 --> 17:46.366
Good morning and thank you Superintendent Torlakson, President Kirst, Vice President Strauss and esteemed board members for having us back once again.

17:47.166 --> 17:52.192
My name is Sam Goidel and I am a senior at Davis Senior High School in Davis Joint Unified School District.

17:52.797 --> 17:59.358
In addition, I am the Education Policy Director for the California Association of Student Councils, commonly referred to as CASC.

18:00.318 --> 18:09.480
For over 40 years, students from all across California have come to evaluate the state of their public schools at the CASC-hosted Student Advisory Board on Education, or SABE.

18:10.380 --> 18:18.702
This year, after three days of continued hard work and long nights, I can tell you with confidence that we have created implementable and feasible proposals.

18:20.447 --> 18:25.289
On the first day, these 50 delegates gathered into one room, and we brainstormed possible topics.

18:25.909 --> 18:32.992
From there began the arduous process of compressing all our different wants, needs, and experiences into succinct proposals.

18:34.512 --> 18:36.733
Much like a construction crew raising a house,

18:37.870 --> 18:48.382
The topic groups had to work long hours, first laying a curriculum foundation, and then building the walls of their proposal, debating the root problems, assumptions, and evidence associated with the topic.

18:48.902 --> 18:53.427
Finally, these delegates perfected the word choice and feasibility, painting their new house.

18:53.988 --> 18:57.612
Today, with the proposals completed, we have come to sell you these houses.

19:00.094 --> 19:08.317
Additionally, delegates learned to spot the difference between state and local policy ideas, keeping in mind the state's direction towards local control.

19:09.057 --> 19:21.122
With this in mind, we specifically set aside time to evaluate possible local solution ideas to each of our topics, and we have attempted to eliminate all locally geared propositions from our presentations.

19:22.418 --> 19:31.442
With that being said, we have also attempted to do the same thing with legislative proposals, spending a great deal of time focusing on the role and limitations of this body.

19:32.122 --> 19:46.808
I and many others here today joined this organization not because we wanted to pad our resumes or just to make a lot of noise, but because we joined this organization because we want to improve the schools that we have grown up in, and I believe today we will do just that.

19:48.587 --> 19:53.250
These six proposals will cover current hot-button issues for the educational world and this body.

19:54.210 --> 20:12.861
In order, today, we will present proposals to combat the issues associated with and we will present solutions for current technology in schools, mental health, the under-representation of English language learners, the new accountability standards, school discipline, and student-to-teacher feedback.

20:13.971 --> 20:18.874
First, I would like to welcome up the Kask State Council President, Nandini Patel.

20:34.266 --> 20:34.506
Okay.

20:35.127 --> 20:38.650
Good morning, Superintendent Torlakson, President Kurse, and Vice President Strauss.

20:39.151 --> 20:47.639
My name is Nandini Patel, and I'm a senior at Vista Mureta High School in Mureta, California, as well as the California Association of Student Councils State President.

20:48.179 --> 20:56.788
On behalf of CASC, we would like to thank the California Department of Education for establishing the Standards Support Office and its Contingent Standards Steering Committee.

20:57.168 --> 21:05.754
We would also like to extend our commendation to the State Board of Education for their continued support for the Student Advisory Board of Education for the past 53 years.

21:06.095 --> 21:13.640
We would also like to thank student board member Olivia Sisson for her continued support and going above and beyond any of our expectations for the past four days.

21:14.141 --> 21:14.441
Thank you.

21:26.894 --> 21:28.315
All right, okay.

21:28.975 --> 21:31.917
So, well, thank you all for making this possible, just off the bat.

21:32.478 --> 21:37.201
And good morning, President Kirst, Vice President Strauss, and Superintendent Torlakson.

21:37.861 --> 21:40.583
So, my name is Kai Bergman, and I go to Berkeley High School.

21:41.143 --> 21:50.089
So, today I will be proposing how to address the problems in implementation of technology in our school system, as well as the lack of student voice inside of this process.

21:50.869 --> 22:06.784
Our proposal will recommend the creation of a committee of stakeholders featuring parents, teachers, and at least one student, as well as tech industry experts, as decided by you all, to serve as a source of guidelines, standards, and efficient practices for the implementation of technology.

22:07.365 --> 22:12.149
But to start, I want to lay out that technology can clearly be used in a positive way.

22:12.890 --> 22:24.727
Technology gives our students the power to communicate with those around the world, to share their ideas for feedback, but most importantly, it just completely reinvents the infrastructure in our schools.

22:24.807 --> 22:29.754
It establishes more student-to-teacher connections, student-to-student connections, and everything is better.

22:31.092 --> 22:35.475
To start again, the California Association of Student Councils stands with technology.

22:36.175 --> 22:38.296
There is, however, room for improvement.

22:38.917 --> 22:43.139
First, there is often a lack of functional and working computers in many schools.

22:43.639 --> 22:54.306
Due to lack of clear, standardized recommendations on damaged or expired technology, schools around the state, such as my own, have computers with broken parts and outdated technology.

22:54.986 --> 22:59.870
The same is very true with internet connection, and many schools lack working and fast internet.

23:00.411 --> 23:06.536
The typical school has the same bandwidth as a four- to five-person home, over the population of an average of 600.

23:07.837 --> 23:17.345
Additionally, the SBAC, while being extremely progressive in the realm of technology, is still relatively new to those administering it, resulting in implementation issues in some schools.

23:18.326 --> 23:27.610
Lastly, there have been some troubles with regards to initiatives such as the attempt at a one-to-one iPad to student plan in the Los Angeles Unified School District.

23:28.511 --> 23:35.314
Yet, in the exact same state, many districts find success in these plans, and they should help serve as guidelines for the future.

23:36.172 --> 23:43.640
School districts like Redondo Beach Unified have had a variety of methods in order to ensure successful technology implementation.

23:44.041 --> 23:50.388
This includes an effective one-to-one textbook checkout-esque Chromebook system, which has had incredible success.

23:51.349 --> 23:57.376
School districts like Redondo Beach Unified and others should help serve as a model in order to replicate these strategies.

23:58.712 --> 24:03.659
As all of you are aware, there is no easy fix for any of these serious and impactful problems.

24:04.220 --> 24:09.306
However, today we present a solution to help mitigate a lot of these negative impacts that we see.

24:10.268 --> 24:13.071
Again, we, the Student Advisory Board on Education,

24:13.772 --> 24:30.306
for the recommendation of the creation of a committee of stakeholders and tech industry experts, which includes necessary student involvement, as decided, again, by you, to serve as a source of recommended guidelines, standards, and the best practices for the implementation of technology.

24:31.087 --> 24:37.069
The Education Technology Task Force, which was disbanded in 2012, laid out the blueprints for technology implementation.

24:37.389 --> 24:39.910
But like I just mentioned, work still needs to be done.

24:40.590 --> 24:49.432
As a result of creating a committee on the implementation of technology, the State Board may incur the cost of recruitment and transportation of committee members to and from meetings.

24:49.932 --> 24:54.934
To help meet with costs, things like meetings can be done over the internet through applications such as Skype.

24:56.074 --> 25:00.678
The committee would be continuously active unless the state board, you all, see a reason to dissolve it.

25:01.558 --> 25:09.384
First, recognize that all the issues that I just described previously have the underlying theme of a need for better direction and implementation.

25:09.824 --> 25:17.850
This committee has the potential to address a lot of the issues that cause things, such as the digital divide, and will help strengthen the administration of the SBAC.

25:18.857 --> 25:25.759
The administration of the SBAC, when improved, will provide an even better representation of students' understanding of Common Core.

25:26.160 --> 25:27.720
This is extremely beneficial.

25:28.360 --> 25:38.124
This committee could also address and help school districts to make informed decisions about technology, to make educated recommendations on the best practices and techniques.

25:39.209 --> 25:44.992
This group could additionally recommend school districts to appropriately spend LCAP funding for technology.

25:45.772 --> 25:48.734
The impacts of this issue, again, are of the greatest magnitude.

25:49.394 --> 26:00.580
Again, there are many schools to look to as models, and by looking at the best practices as guidelines, this committee can provide clear and correct information in a standardized and formal way to the school districts.

26:01.660 --> 26:09.543
One last potential area of focus for this committee is turning away from the status quo by increasing engagement of schools and students, teachers and parents.

26:10.124 --> 26:15.186
This committee, again, solves for this as there will be higher levels of involvement from all the parties stated.

26:16.206 --> 26:20.608
With the promotion of student involvement, implementation plans can be improved and bettered.

26:20.928 --> 26:27.451
The support of adding a student to this committee is critical as it will allow for a higher level of insight on the problems.

26:28.411 --> 26:35.436
Students are the one being directly affected by the policies and the technology in schools and they deserve a say in this process.

26:35.777 --> 26:45.184
The effect of the committee and its student involvement can greatly improve the methods and for which money is spent in schools to ensure the maximum utility and benefit from it.

26:45.604 --> 26:49.547
Thank you very much and I'm very proud to propose.

26:49.887 --> 26:51.569
I now open the floor to prep questions.

26:54.229 --> 26:55.170
Board member questions.

26:56.632 --> 26:59.254
Go ahead.

26:59.855 --> 27:00.596
Just make a comment.

27:00.676 --> 27:01.957
Excellent recommendation.

27:02.778 --> 27:12.008
We've been seeing a need to update that technology plan that was formed from the task force work and started some meetings and want to make an invitation right here.

27:12.288 --> 27:13.250
Can you join us?

27:13.310 --> 27:14.591
Would you be one who wanted to?

27:15.832 --> 27:17.634
be one of the voices on the working group.

27:17.894 --> 27:18.634
Yeah, I would love to.

27:19.035 --> 27:19.895
Excellent, excellent.

27:19.915 --> 27:21.276
We're signing you up.

27:21.697 --> 27:22.077
Thank you.

27:22.397 --> 27:23.138
Thank you very much.

27:23.298 --> 27:28.302
And if there's another colleague of yours that worked on this that you wish to be involved, let us know.

27:28.922 --> 27:29.683
I have a comment.

27:29.703 --> 27:35.988
The statistic that the average bandwidth is the same as a family in a school

27:36.868 --> 27:39.191
I think we've made a lot of progress from that.

27:39.932 --> 27:50.002
I know that was two or three years ago, but we have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into technology, a lot of it to administer the Smarter Balanced test.

27:50.042 --> 27:55.027
So to administer that test, you have to have much more broad-based bandwidth.

27:56.068 --> 28:00.910
It's probably, I don't know what the situation is now, but I think the task force ought to take a look at that.

28:01.650 --> 28:03.331
How much have we closed that gap?

28:03.611 --> 28:06.092
So that's something I'd put on your agenda.

28:06.412 --> 28:09.613
We really worked hard on that in the past few years.

28:10.513 --> 28:10.873
Thank you.

28:10.993 --> 28:11.633
Thank you very much.

28:33.154 --> 28:34.975
Good morning, Super, oh, what's this?

28:35.556 --> 28:36.556
How do I press the button?

28:36.817 --> 28:36.917
Okay.

28:40.139 --> 28:40.899
So it was on before.

28:40.939 --> 28:42.000
The red light should be on.

28:42.641 --> 28:43.781
Okay, this is working?

28:43.861 --> 28:45.382
Okay, all right.

28:45.442 --> 28:50.786
Good morning, Superintendent Torlakson, President Kirst, and esteemed board members.

28:51.326 --> 29:00.653
My name is Shamaela Pregada, and I am a senior attending Torrey Pines High School in the San Diego Unified High School District, which is located in San Diego, California.

29:01.658 --> 29:09.442
The mission statement of the Department of Education is to create strong, effective schools that cause a high standard of student accomplishment.

29:10.222 --> 29:21.027
However, the lack of knowledge among students about resources designed to support those suffering from mental illnesses are hindering students' ability to reach this high standard of student accomplishment.

29:21.727 --> 29:25.889
They're simply not receiving the support that they need to be successful in school.

29:27.076 --> 29:42.068
Given these circumstances, the Student Advisory Board on Education suggests that this can be addressed by establishing a framework for mental health which would supplement the pre-existing mental health standards created by the California Department of Education.

29:43.669 --> 29:52.216
Comprehensive and extensive standards such as recognizing common mental health conditions and methods of seeking mental health assistance are in place.

29:52.756 --> 29:56.159
However, these standards are not as effective as originally intended.

29:57.119 --> 30:09.789
When speaking to students throughout the state of California from diverse schools as Hamilton, South Pasadena, Torrey Pines, Henry M. Gunn, and Vista Murrieta High School, there was a common underlying theme.

30:10.610 --> 30:20.098
The majority of students are not able to identify that they have a mental illness or how to maintain positive mental health due to their lack of education on the topic.

30:21.021 --> 30:30.546
From a recent case in San Gabriel High School in Alhambra Unified School District, we find the knowledge of these standards help prevent suicide.

30:31.266 --> 30:43.252
Over the span of four months, at the beginning of the 2016 to 2017 school year, at least three students from San Gabriel High reported suicide thoughts or contemplated suicide.

30:44.453 --> 30:50.556
These students were able to seek help from peer counselors and ultimately were referred to professional treatment.

30:52.597 --> 31:07.770
San Gabriel High has a two-year counseling course that trains students to become peer counselors, and because of this program, students are more comfortable reporting mental health concerns, thereby addressing the issues at hand and decreasing the risk of suicide.

31:08.570 --> 31:17.538
The peer counseling program is just one example of a school developing a framework for mental health and the framework's effectiveness in promoting student wellness.

31:19.471 --> 31:28.735
While these standards may seem like they thoroughly address a variety of topics relating to mental health, we still see suicide being the third leading cause of death in our youth.

31:29.876 --> 31:36.639
In fact, one in five children have or will suffer from a mental illness some point in their lives.

31:37.779 --> 31:44.162
Of all the disability groups in California, those with mental illnesses make up the largest high school dropout rate.

31:45.106 --> 31:51.049
Mental health impacts students' capacities to compute knowledge, thereby lowering academic performance.

31:52.009 --> 31:58.052
Meanwhile, in New York, the state ranked 50th in age-adjusted rate of suicide.

31:58.172 --> 32:03.835
A separate mental health framework is in place for pre-K to 12 public schools.

32:04.255 --> 32:13.020
The agenda of this framework includes delivery models that focus on mental health and education, as well as suggested frameworks to promote positive school climates.

32:14.068 --> 32:21.513
Massachusetts, for example, as well, has a mental health framework that introduces how to identify common mental health conditions.

32:23.114 --> 32:27.237
In comparison, mental health is being devalued throughout the state of California.

32:28.378 --> 32:39.025
The root problem here is that students of all ages are not adequately educated on mental health, their symptoms, and are ultimately not taught how to combat certain mental health issues.

32:40.066 --> 32:42.288
Without sufficient mental health education,

32:44.108 --> 32:51.938
Students feel discouraged to ask for the support fundamental to the individual growth and academic success.

32:52.987 --> 32:59.309
Many California frameworks are being evaluated, including the health framework that has not been changed since its creation in 2003.

32:59.510 --> 33:06.892
This is the opportune time to make our existing health framework more comprehensive with the mental health section.

33:07.573 --> 33:20.898
In fact, one of the 2016 goals of the Health Subject Matter Committee on the Instructional Quality Commission is to provide guidance and support for the development of the 2019 health education framework.

33:22.102 --> 33:34.018
Therefore, we, the Student Advisory Board on Education, recommend that you urge the Instructional Quality Commission create a framework for mental health for the existing mental health standards for California public schools.

33:35.066 --> 33:43.089
Both Massachusetts and New York have mental health frameworks in place to guide educators to meet the mental health standards of their respective states.

33:44.009 --> 33:51.572
The low rates of suicide in both of these states proves that having a mental health framework is effective in promoting student wellness.

33:52.573 --> 34:03.297
In order for the Department of Education's mission statement to be fulfilled, students must have sufficient mental health education in order to be able to cope with mental health issues they may face later on.

34:04.778 --> 34:12.883
Proper implementation of extensive mental health standards are essential to the well-being and success of students throughout the state of California.

34:13.343 --> 34:13.704
Thank you.

34:19.747 --> 34:20.087
Thank you.

34:20.187 --> 34:21.768
Board member comments, questions?

34:22.369 --> 34:23.209
Board member Rucker.

34:23.249 --> 34:31.454
Well, first of all, thank you very much for, I want to thank both you and your, wow.

34:34.392 --> 34:35.933
My mic is really on.

34:38.135 --> 34:43.820
I want to thank you and your committee members who worked on this project on this particular topic.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.462
And I'm whispering, by the way.

34:46.482 --> 34:47.623
I just want to say that.

34:48.203 --> 34:52.346
Because this is a particularly difficult subject to tackle.

34:52.987 --> 35:01.754
And so before I say my comment and ask my question, I do want to ask the members of your committee who worked on this to just please stand if they're in the room.

35:06.087 --> 35:21.617
So the reason why I ask that, thank you very much, the reason why I ask that is, you can go ahead and sit down, the reason why I ask for you to stand is it's very difficult whether we're talking about adults or children in high school or elementary school or middle school to talk about issues of mental health.

35:22.317 --> 35:23.698
And it's not a new thing.

35:24.019 --> 35:29.583
Having the concerns and the issues that you raised about students in school, it's not a new thing.

35:30.003 --> 35:42.493
It's easy for people to say or to distill it down to a single topic and say, well, this is something that's happened because of all the changes in school and the stresses that are put on students.

35:42.854 --> 35:49.339
But there are many stresses that are common to every generation that's gone through school in this country or in any country.

35:49.779 --> 36:02.427
But the fact that you were able to so well develop the idea and develop the cause and the purpose for adding a study of mental health and training for educators, I think that that was very well-rounded.

36:02.787 --> 36:08.210
I did have a question for you concerning the statistics you talked about on dropouts.

36:08.731 --> 36:15.655
You said that there are many students with mental health issues who are a large portion of the high school dropouts.

36:17.023 --> 36:22.065
And so can you tell me a little bit more about where you teased out that information from?

36:23.165 --> 36:39.390
So part of my group did the fact checking and research for that, so I'm not aware of the specific percentage, but we did find that students with mental illnesses do make up the largest high school dropout rate.

36:40.070 --> 36:42.051
Part of it is because of their mental illness.

36:43.331 --> 36:50.117
So I was just trying to get out to have in place a mental health framework to address those with mental illness.

36:50.337 --> 37:01.546
The reason why I ask is because right now when the board has had the discussion about setting policy concerning the graduation rate and looking at the cohort and talking about dropouts,

37:01.866 --> 37:19.183
We talk about academic programs and about academic recovery, but there is a link to school climate issues that you touched on in identifying this group of students or this subgroup of students among those dropouts that I'm not really sure we have thought about as well as we could have.

37:19.523 --> 37:24.588
So I really do appreciate you bringing out that particular topic and that particular statistic.

37:24.648 --> 37:25.789
Thank you very much.

37:25.809 --> 37:26.230
Thank you.

37:29.426 --> 37:31.648
So first, I want to thank you and your entire committee.

37:31.728 --> 37:38.234
You really did your research, and so those who did the research and the fact-checking, just a credit to you to present a really thorough presentation.

37:38.654 --> 37:46.861
So you may know, and you did comment, the Instructional Quality Commission is going to be looking at the health framework and the recommendations with a commitment to update from 13 years ago.

37:48.462 --> 37:51.803
So we'd really like to take your recommendations, if that's okay.

37:51.843 --> 38:07.108
We have a November 17th IQC meeting that Member Rucker and I will be at, and if that would be okay with you and your committee, we'll be glad to present on behalf of the students your recommendations to consider as far as the development of the Health Framework Committee, the new framework.

38:07.128 --> 38:09.349
So thank you so much, and just a credit to you.

38:09.369 --> 38:15.151
I know I've watched you all work in the past, and I know you probably worked very, very late last night to finalize your presentation,

38:16.391 --> 38:23.838
To credit to all of you for just the thoroughness, both the data and the state implications for the recommendations that you're making.

38:24.178 --> 38:24.498
Thank you.

38:24.518 --> 38:27.741
Okay, thank you.

38:46.488 --> 38:52.896
Hello, honorable board members of the State Board of Education, Superintendent Torlakson and President Hurst.

38:53.577 --> 38:57.081
I'd like to thank you all for taking the time out of your day to listen to our proposal.

38:57.242 --> 39:01.267
I know I can speak on behalf of all of us when I say that we greatly appreciate it.

39:01.947 --> 39:03.209
My name is Haley Holthausen.

39:03.249 --> 39:07.853
I'm a senior at Mira Loma High School in the San Juan Unified School District right here in Sacramento.

39:08.433 --> 39:17.141
I'm here today to present our proposal on behalf of the underrepresented students in the English language development program here in our California public schools.

39:18.022 --> 39:28.074
According to its mission, the California Department of Education strives to assist in the development of listening, speaking, reading, and writing proficiencies amongst the ELD students.

39:28.534 --> 39:34.521
These fundamental skills have been deemed the core of achievement both inside and outside the classroom.

39:35.482 --> 39:48.607
California has the highest percentage of English language learner students in the United States at 22.1% of students or 1.37 million students total enrolled in the ELD program.

39:49.187 --> 39:58.211
We aim to acknowledge and represent one of the most underrepresented populations in the California public school system by highlighting their academic needs.

39:59.231 --> 40:12.438
Of the 1.3 million English language learner students in California, in the graduating class of 2015, only 69.4% met graduation requirements and were able to receive a high school diploma.

40:12.999 --> 40:22.664
Compare that to the 82.3% of total California public high school students who received a diploma, the students in the English language development programs are falling 12.9% behind.

40:22.844 --> 40:23.905
In the 2015 to 2016 academic school year,

40:29.728 --> 40:34.490
1.1 million K through 12 students took the California English Language Development Test.

40:35.071 --> 40:41.775
Out of those students, 41% scored as advanced or early advanced, earning them a passing score.

40:42.395 --> 40:55.903
In comparison to the 2014 to 2015 school year, where only 18% earned a passing score, we can see that this number is substantially better than those in the past five years, where the average was only 18.2%.

40:58.382 --> 41:06.365
However, the 59% of students who are still not attaining this passing score demonstrates a clear room for improvement.

41:07.066 --> 41:15.029
Students in California public schools have both paid witness to and experienced firsthand the hardships of students in the English language development programs.

41:15.709 --> 41:28.076
Students at Mira Loma High School in Sacramento have seen English language learner students not have equitable access to tutoring programs or extra help for their difficult classes due to these programs only being offered in English.

41:28.776 --> 41:36.040
Students at Monterey Hills Elementary have been wrongfully placed in the English language development programs due to insufficient testing methods.

41:36.520 --> 41:47.022
and this misplacement led to them losing valuable instructional class time and caused a limited choice in future courses even after moving out of the ELD program.

41:47.703 --> 42:02.106
Students at Diamond Bar High School in Orange County have been denied access to AP math courses due to their status as ELD students, while students from Virginia Peterson Elementary have been removed from advanced programs such as GATE due to their status as ELD.

42:03.326 --> 42:16.009
While the English Language Development Program has proved critical in advancing the English proficiency levels in students, it should not hinder their ability to receive the same education or opportunities as students not enrolled.

42:16.869 --> 42:26.312
The California Association of Student Councils and the Student Advisory Board on Education is in full support of the current English Language Development Program being implemented.

42:26.812 --> 42:31.333
However, due to these testimonies and statistics alike, we respectfully

42:32.253 --> 42:38.897
we respectfully present that the administration of the English Language Development Program remains incomplete in many school districts.

42:39.777 --> 42:44.899
As you can see, each school, and therefore each district, has their own challenges facing them.

42:45.400 --> 42:58.386
This is why we are proposing that the California State Board of Education recommend that at least one current student and one former student from the English Language Development Program be represented on the English Learner Advisory Committee, or ELAC.

42:59.087 --> 43:10.080
Subsequently, we recommend that in addition to one student from the ELAC committee within a district, that at least one student representative serve on the district level English Learner Advisory Committee.

43:10.721 --> 43:16.228
We also suggest that parent representatives consist of at least one representative from an elementary school.

43:17.009 --> 43:22.532
We recognize the current extent of parent involvement in the ELAC, though minimal in some cases.

43:23.052 --> 43:29.735
Parents are not always completely aware of the extent to which their presence can impact their child's likelihood to succeed in school.

43:30.376 --> 43:37.359
By requiring the inclusion of students, we may see a spike in parent involvement due to the increased ties they have to the committee.

43:38.562 --> 43:42.726
We project our proposal to come at a minimal cost to the State Board of Education.

43:43.307 --> 43:54.638
These minimal costs may arise should the districts decide to reimburse the additional students for their transportation, provide refreshments, or as a result of any other expenses they may see fit.

43:55.519 --> 44:01.603
This committee will stimulate a positive and constructive dialogue surrounding the English language development programs.

44:02.103 --> 44:06.266
These committees will give the students who need it the most a voice in their education.

44:06.886 --> 44:14.331
With the engagement of these very key stakeholders, we hope to further the progress being made with the English language development program.

44:15.111 --> 44:24.893
We hope to decrease the challenges faced by individual schools and districts by recognizing and catering to the different hardships facing elementary, middle, and high schools.

44:25.473 --> 44:35.415
Together, it is our responsibility to give our community's students a voice, and I implore you to consider our proposal regarding the inclusion of students in both the ELAC and the DELAC.

44:35.975 --> 44:40.835
Who else can better understand the needs of the English language learner students than them themselves?

44:41.516 --> 44:43.496
Thank you, and I now yield myself to the chair.

44:44.417 --> 44:44.857
Thank you.

44:45.578 --> 44:46.498
Board member comments?

44:48.240 --> 44:49.641
Board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

44:51.642 --> 44:53.603
Thank you so much for this presentation.

44:53.623 --> 45:01.349
You know, my heart was just warming up and hearing the advocacy on behalf of students that are some of the most vulnerable that we have in our system.

45:01.889 --> 45:05.551
And I think it's incredible that in, how long did it take you to do the research?

45:06.492 --> 45:08.093
Well, we started on Sunday.

45:09.614 --> 45:21.909
So within maybe four days, you were able to shed light on the inequities and differences and some of the challenges that EL students have to encounter through the K-12 system that we have.

45:22.329 --> 45:27.135
So in four days, it's something that's pretty obvious, right, for anyone that does the research.

45:27.435 --> 45:38.163
So I thank you for it, and I thank you for the recommendation, and I think it's a good recommendation to consider incorporating EL students and a reclassified student in some of the decision making.

45:39.164 --> 45:47.329
As a reclassified student, I think that we are the ones that have the best perspective, because it's a personal perspective that we have.

45:47.690 --> 45:52.193
So I want to thank you and your group, who could raise their hand or stand up so they could be acknowledged.

45:52.393 --> 45:54.234
Go ahead and stand up so you can get a little camera time too.

45:59.887 --> 46:02.874
Thank you, thank you for your hard work, and thank you for the presentation.

46:02.894 --> 46:07.243
All right, we're ready for the next presentation, I think.

46:18.681 --> 46:22.623
Good morning Superintendent Torlakson, President Kirst and honorable board members.

46:23.144 --> 46:24.545
My name is Qazi Ahmad.

46:25.065 --> 46:30.488
I am a junior at Middle College High School in Loda Unified School District in the city of Stockton, California.

46:31.589 --> 46:42.015
Accountability in education is essential to ensure that students are given the greatest priority in their schools and that schools continue to have continuous improvement.

46:42.515 --> 46:49.925
Today, we are at a crossroads in our accountability system where our actions now will affect generations to come.

46:50.566 --> 46:59.278
The academic performance index used a unilateral system that held our schools accountable solely with test scores.

47:00.479 --> 47:03.900
Our schools are much more than these test scores alone.

47:04.600 --> 47:16.644
And the student advisory board on education commenced this honorable board for their work in creating a new accountability system that focuses on a holistic approach when evaluating our schools.

47:17.424 --> 47:18.825
Over these past few days,

47:19.665 --> 47:29.898
While reviewing the frameworks of the new accountability system, we have realized that the system greatly increases the amount of areas and the amount of indicators that are examined in the system.

47:30.359 --> 47:34.804
However, a factor that can still be improved upon is student input.

47:35.425 --> 47:41.154
The new accountability system will not be truly holistic if students are not asked to contribute.

47:41.735 --> 47:50.428
If the state does not know what the students are experiencing, then there is no way that the state can hold districts accountable for student performance.

47:51.249 --> 48:16.216
Thus, the Student Advisory Board on Education recommends that the State Board of Education establishes methods of student input, such as through student surveys, under the College and Career Readiness Indicator and the Appropriately Assigned Teachers Access to Curriculum-Aligned Instructional Materials and Safe, Clean, and Functional School Facilities Standard, which is defined as a local performance indicator of the new accountability system.

48:17.036 --> 48:30.543
We also suggest that the board recommends that local districts use a survey such as the California Healthy Kids Survey or the California Student Perspective Survey as a measure for the school climate standard of the new system.

48:31.304 --> 48:42.230
Student input is valuable for the college and career readiness indicator because ultimately, students are the only ones who can assess how prepared they are for life after high school.

48:42.910 --> 48:56.823
Surveys can include topics such as whether students are aware of the opportunities they have for life after high school, as well as if they feel knowledgeable enough to actually pursue those opportunities presented to them.

48:57.583 --> 49:01.207
For the standard previously mentioned under the local performance indicator,

49:01.727 --> 49:09.369
It is necessary to incorporate student voice because these standards are the fundamental and everyday experiences of students statewide.

49:09.890 --> 49:12.230
Students are the ones going to school every day.

49:12.710 --> 49:18.832
They are the ones directly receiving instruction from their teachers, and they are the ones directly using the school facilities.

49:19.392 --> 49:30.556
These firsthand experiences of the students prove that student input under this indicator is one of the most meaningful ways to produce feedback from the primary stakeholders in the education system.

49:31.276 --> 49:45.819
From a fiscal point of view, the costs of implementing this proposal are very minimal because you, the honorable board members, have already dedicated resources towards creating and defining these indicators and the measures that go into these indicators.

49:46.279 --> 49:53.281
Thus, adding additional student voice through a student survey would not be a financial burden on the state board.

49:53.761 --> 50:04.105
It is our shared responsibility to create an accountability system that represents all aspects of our schools, and our proposal calls for a greater student input in these specific aspects.

50:04.585 --> 50:15.729
We urge you to include student input, especially in the form of student surveys, into the revised accountability system in order to ensure a completely holistic look into our schools and their performances.

50:16.349 --> 50:26.178
It is a core belief of the California Association of Student Councils that equality of input and participation of all group members strengthens overall group performance.

50:26.598 --> 50:33.625
We urge you to take action on this proposal and ensure the new accountability system is truly equitable and truly holistic.

50:33.885 --> 50:37.268
Thank you for your time and I'll leave the floor open to clarifications or questions.

50:44.380 --> 50:46.022
Thank you for that board comments.

50:47.403 --> 50:48.264
So I remember.

50:48.384 --> 50:48.745
Thank you.

50:48.825 --> 50:51.668
I wanted to express my appreciation.

50:51.728 --> 50:57.234
And also, I'd like to acknowledge the members of your work group, because clearly you spent a lot of time thinking about this.

50:57.294 --> 51:02.260
So folks who worked on this, if you could stand up and as Felisa said, get some camera time.

51:07.903 --> 51:09.984
Your recommendations are particularly timely.

51:10.004 --> 51:23.647
I know in talking to a number of the students yesterday that you've been paying a lot of attention to our agenda and the very next item has to do with the indicators that we'll be picking for the accountability system, including a couple of the ones that you mentioned.

51:23.707 --> 51:29.128
So we will certainly take those to heart and consider them very deeply.

51:29.808 --> 51:42.420
I would also point out that Chief Deputy Price, I believe, is chairing a work group on the school climate pieces of it, and I know he's listening intently and will also be incorporating that in his work.

51:42.440 --> 51:43.301
So thank you again.

51:43.321 --> 51:47.124
Okay, thank you.

51:47.204 --> 51:48.045
Next presentation.

52:02.237 --> 52:02.878
It's on.

52:03.538 --> 52:04.899
Okay.

52:05.520 --> 52:11.765
Good morning, Superintendent Torlakson, President Kirst, Vice President Strauss, and honorable board members.

52:12.365 --> 52:13.486
My name is Para Rowland.

52:13.706 --> 52:20.692
I am a senior at South Pasadena High School in the South Pasadena Unified School District representing the California Association of Student Councils.

52:21.784 --> 52:30.591
Students throughout California are afflicted by ineffective suspension and expulsion rates, veering them off the pathway to success and creating a negative feedback loop.

52:31.232 --> 52:36.016
In an ideal world, all disciplinary policies would be clear and conducive to growth.

52:36.676 --> 52:42.241
Instead of punishment for its own sake, discipline would serve as a tool to mold students into better citizens.

52:43.177 --> 52:55.520
Though recent movement away from zero-tolerance policies and consequent statewide reduction of suspension and expulsion rates, we realize that both CASC and you all seek to eventually reach this same ideal state.

52:56.539 --> 53:09.650
As a delegation representing the 6.4 million students of California, we felt that in our schools, there's sometimes apathy from our disciplinarians and deep-rooted mistrust from the students targeted by ineffective disciplinary policies.

53:10.250 --> 53:25.183
To bridge this gap of misunderstanding, we, the Student Advisory Board on Education, would like the State Board of Education to suggest that district-wide committees that include but are not limited to students, administrators, and teachers

53:25.884 --> 53:36.658
are formed that will meet annually to approve and, if necessary, revise the disciplinary policies for that school district in hopes of establishing common ground between students and faculty.

53:37.639 --> 53:40.483
This, properly implemented, will have a threefold effect.

53:41.304 --> 53:54.087
In the annual enacting of this process, students and administration must come to an agreement that the disciplinary policy is not only effective, but just as relevant as it was the previous year.

53:54.647 --> 53:58.788
This ensures that actions taken through these guidelines are consistent.

53:59.408 --> 54:09.750
In lieu of self-interpretation of the rules by individual staff members, a more objective, defined standard would be utilized to guarantee discipline is warranted.

54:10.590 --> 54:20.742
Additionally, a yearly revision prevents potential disciplinary action based on antiquated guidelines, avoiding the confusion and miscommunication from irregular revision of policy.

54:21.818 --> 54:35.661
Second, with the inclusion of student representatives in approving a district's disciplinary policy, all parties affected by it would now have increased awareness of its content, clarifying and informing the student body of all relevant changes with more efficacy.

54:36.301 --> 54:37.302
The rationale is simple.

54:37.902 --> 54:43.003
Students are more receptive to their peers, and they're more accessible to each other than administration.

54:44.003 --> 54:50.710
Third, and most importantly, direct student cooperation with administration breeds a sense of trust between the two parties.

54:51.371 --> 55:03.062
Knowing that their peers are part of the process and are therefore directly responsible for approving disciplinary policies, students accept the consequences from the disciplinarian's decisions partially as their own.

55:03.923 --> 55:10.485
As a result, students have less resentment towards those in power and instances of disciplinary action, increasing trust.

55:11.166 --> 55:20.069
Additionally, students who regularly interact with administration and whose voices is highly prioritized as the adults can serve as advocates for said adults.

55:20.689 --> 55:28.691
prove to other students that those administering discipline do care about students' well-being and seek to invest in their futures.

55:29.431 --> 55:39.033
Conversely, the presence of a student at this approval meeting will emphasize that the people affected by disciplinary policy are just that, people.

55:40.053 --> 55:42.954
With that, I'm going to segue into a personal story of mine.

55:44.758 --> 55:50.004
I met my best friend in middle school through our local competitive swim team.

55:51.165 --> 55:55.230
He's a talented pianist, committed Boy Scout, and an excellent scholar.

55:57.092 --> 56:03.258
He's also a recovering drug addict, part of a population often targeted by disciplinary policies.

56:04.229 --> 56:15.972
In the past year, as his new drug use turned from casual social to something more serious, his loved ones and I watched him turn into this reclusive, angry shadow of himself.

56:17.192 --> 56:20.233
By October, he was using crystal meth on a daily basis.

56:21.393 --> 56:24.254
Though by January, he was actively on the road to recovery,

56:25.544 --> 56:28.805
Finals were a hurdle, leading him to abuse Adderall.

56:29.625 --> 56:33.226
He was caught and threatened with expulsion during his five-day suspension.

56:34.326 --> 56:40.547
A counselor and assistant principal discussed alternative punishments with him and mentioned the possibility of addiction counseling.

56:41.207 --> 56:47.308
However, the decision was ultimately up to our principal, who'd been relatively uninvolved the whole time.

56:47.949 --> 56:54.590
After a cursory explanation on the final day, she announced the decision to continue the pursual of his expulsion.

56:55.430 --> 57:01.634
For three weeks, he waited, not knowing what would happen to him, what would happen to his case.

57:02.794 --> 57:08.918
Eventually, the school told him they were dropping it, and that he would be able to start school again next Monday.

57:09.718 --> 57:10.338
Just like that.

57:10.879 --> 57:16.282
We still don't know what changed their minds, but I am so glad to say they did.

57:18.454 --> 57:24.421
Since then, he got a four on his AP Calculus AB test, which he had failed first semester.

57:24.441 --> 57:35.534
The class finished his Eagle Scout project, started school at UC San Diego, and most importantly, he has been sober since the very first day he was called into the office.

57:36.522 --> 57:38.562
His story isn't one that I share readily.

57:38.922 --> 57:43.203
In fact, many of these details would be new, even to his parents and our close friends.

57:43.843 --> 57:52.925
He's consented to my sharing it to emphasize the impact that an advocate can have on authorities, such as your all's view of a delinquent.

57:53.325 --> 57:56.465
This isn't possible for every single case, and it's not what we're asking for.

57:57.046 --> 58:04.987
But we know that a student representative on a district discipline board, at the beginning of this process, can serve to humanize victims of poor discipline,

58:05.587 --> 58:13.210
poor discipline policies and remind administrations of the effects of their policies in the same way that I have shown their effects on my friend.

58:14.430 --> 58:22.393
Those who commit the most drastic violations are often at the most risk to split between the cracks as a result of suspension or expulsion.

58:23.033 --> 58:34.297
Removal of a delinquent from a classroom environment may improve classroom safety in some situations, but can also cause said delinquent to permanently remove themselves from the education system.

58:35.276 --> 58:44.306
However, through my friend's story, it is clear that administrators, by listening to students, possess the potential to change the trajectory of their lives.

58:44.686 --> 58:56.139
We want open dialogue, just like the assistant principal and the counselor provided, between students, parents, and administration in districts across the state to ensure that they understand where the other parties are coming from.

58:56.659 --> 59:06.162
so that administrations have a greater understanding of what motivates students' delinquency, and that students and parents are not in the dark about action taken or its motivations.

59:07.183 --> 59:23.228
The three main actions intended by our proposal, regular revision to remove ambiguity of disciplinary policy, a knowledgeable student representative to serve as a resource to students, and a bridge of understanding between stakeholders all serve one greater goal.

59:23.988 --> 59:27.630
the continued reduction of delinquency rates.

59:28.491 --> 59:38.616
By adopting our proposal and allowing students to have a stake in the disciplinary system, more effective policies are created and student satisfaction with disciplinary action increased.

59:39.397 --> 59:40.117
Thank you for your time.

59:40.478 --> 59:41.978
I now open the floor for questions.

59:43.399 --> 59:51.504
Board Member Sandoval.

59:55.267 --> 01:00:00.430
Thank you for a very well-researched and heartfelt proposal, you and members of your team.

01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:00.890
Thank you.

01:00:01.590 --> 01:00:07.793
I just wanted to mention this is clearly a very important critical issue, lives.

01:00:08.033 --> 01:00:09.074
We're talking about human lives.

01:00:09.374 --> 01:00:11.715
And I'm a volunteer.

01:00:11.875 --> 01:00:16.918
I am a volunteer facilitator of restorative practices, restorative justice circles.

01:00:17.598 --> 01:00:34.668
and those formats really have the power to start healing in communities and also open dialogue between individuals, not just students, but administrators, teachers, and it has the power to help make things right, to start to get things on a good path.

01:00:34.748 --> 01:00:40.892
So I was happy to see that mentioned in your proposal and just wanted to thank you and your team for your work.

01:00:43.633 --> 01:00:44.354
Board Member Rucker.

01:00:45.965 --> 01:00:53.651
I also want to thank you for the work that you've done on this, and I really want to compliment the way that you framed this conversation.

01:00:54.412 --> 01:01:07.643
It touched my heart, but not just because of the personal story, but because I too have seen how we have, as a society, created a norm that dehumanizes the policies that we are implementing.

01:01:08.023 --> 01:01:14.208
And it cuts across not just what we do on school discipline issues, but in so many different ways.

01:01:14.588 --> 01:01:28.520
When people talk about how many mouths they have to feed instead of children, and when people talk about hands instead of employees, we start thinking about how we can simply create and identify a statistic or a number.

01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:36.686
And that happens when we call a student like your friend a delinquent instead of a student with special needs.

01:01:37.047 --> 01:01:39.829
And so I think it's very important in the way you framed it

01:01:40.209 --> 01:01:48.713
Not only that we understand that we need to take back how we identify, but we need to understand what it means to name the all.

01:01:49.074 --> 01:01:53.296
So I really appreciate not only what you said, but how you framed it.

01:01:53.316 --> 01:01:54.596
So thank you very much.

01:01:54.616 --> 01:01:54.977
Thank you.

01:01:55.957 --> 01:01:56.657
Board Member Sun.

01:01:58.078 --> 01:02:00.479
And I just want to thank you on a personal basis.

01:02:00.579 --> 01:02:05.142
Our school is going through a fairly large revamp of our discipline policies and looking at that.

01:02:05.202 --> 01:02:08.764
And you reminded me how important the student voice is in that process.

01:02:08.784 --> 01:02:09.264
So thank you.

01:02:11.121 --> 01:02:12.302
All right, next.

01:02:12.863 --> 01:02:16.207
Just same commendations, and could we see your team?

01:02:16.267 --> 01:02:16.928
Could they stand up?

01:02:18.070 --> 01:02:28.543
Okay, next.

01:02:38.965 --> 01:02:43.889
Once again, thank you, Superintendent Turleckson, President Curris, and Vice President Stiles for having us here today.

01:02:44.409 --> 01:02:52.115
My name is Nandini Patel, and I am the current Cass State President, as well as a senior at Vista Murrieta High School in the Murrieta Valley Unified School District.

01:02:52.925 --> 01:02:59.390
For well over 30 years, the delegates of the Student Advisory Board on Education have identified the need for student feedback to teachers.

01:02:59.931 --> 01:03:06.396
In today's society, our minds are geared to think that feedback is a negative term that is synonymous to criticism.

01:03:06.856 --> 01:03:19.746
However, the students of the California Association of Student Councils, or CASC, have carefully crafted a system that provides important feedback to teachers regarding the climate of their classroom, the students' perception of the effectiveness of their teaching,

01:03:20.246 --> 01:03:24.749
and the overall impact of their teaching style that it has on a student.

01:03:25.189 --> 01:03:33.235
According to its mission statement, the Department of Education serves our state by innovating and collaborating with educators, schools, parents, and community partners.

01:03:33.755 --> 01:03:48.205
As an organization that seeks consensus through collaboration, we would like to invite the State Board of Education to attend a meeting with the Association of California School Administrators, ACSA, the California Teachers Association, CTA,

01:03:48.865 --> 01:03:58.868
California Association of Student Councils, CASC, in order to reach a probable solution regarding the concern of implementing a student-to-teacher feedback system in the California public education system.

01:03:59.328 --> 01:04:11.011
We would like to discuss the student-to-teacher feedback system developed by CASC in addition to other surveys in order to streamline the students' perception of the classroom environment by giving teachers who are seeking continuous improvement in

01:04:11.511 --> 01:04:13.013
the information they need to do so.

01:04:13.514 --> 01:04:25.692
By implementing the system, students will be empowered as citizens who have an equal right to an opinion, while also receiving a platform to provide systematic and developed feedback to the people who have one of the largest stakes in their lives, their teachers.

01:04:26.619 --> 01:04:34.368
One of the most important factors to note about this system is that it will not be used in the district evaluation of them, nor in the hiring or firing of a teacher.

01:04:35.028 --> 01:04:47.682
Student to teacher evaluations are a simple and rather informal way to allow a teacher to gauge the student's perspective on factors that will influence their performance in class by allowing administration to tailor the questions they wish to see analyzed

01:04:47.722 --> 01:04:48.262
in their school.

01:04:48.702 --> 01:04:54.444
Some of the potential questions that could be asked include, does the teacher give a balanced presentation from different viewpoints?

01:04:54.865 --> 01:04:57.706
Is communication between the teacher and the student encouraged?

01:04:58.186 --> 01:05:01.127
And does the teacher give clear explanations and instructions?

01:05:01.647 --> 01:05:04.708
The student's answers will be scored on a scale of one through five.

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:12.891
From there, the school is given back a comprehensive report that depicts the average score for each of the 25 questions through an overall class average,

01:05:13.411 --> 01:05:22.433
the teacher's classes by periods, the class compared to the school's average, the class compared to the rest of the department, and a breakdown for each of the questions the teacher chooses to ask.

01:05:22.933 --> 01:05:35.436
That being said, as we have not been able to properly explain the system to all of the parties involved, we have called for a collaborative meeting between ACSA, CTA, CASC, and hopefully the State Board of Education

01:05:36.216 --> 01:05:38.657
to discuss the possible implementation of this system.

01:05:39.198 --> 01:05:51.444
CASC is requesting the presence of the State Board of Education at this meeting in order to have them involved in the conversation and to discuss the feasibility of the student to teacher feedback system to be implemented at the statewide level.

01:05:51.964 --> 01:05:53.365
I now open the floor for questions.

01:05:54.706 --> 01:05:55.586
Okay, questions?

01:05:56.007 --> 01:06:03.671
We'll certainly want to consider this and get help from our staff on how to, where will it be?

01:06:05.341 --> 01:06:06.301
Most likely in Sacramento.

01:06:06.601 --> 01:06:06.901
Okay.

01:06:08.182 --> 01:06:10.542
All right, any, thank you.

01:06:10.742 --> 01:06:11.162
Thank you.

01:06:11.222 --> 01:06:11.782
We will.

01:06:16.803 --> 01:06:18.383
One member left, Ortiz-Lacon.

01:06:19.564 --> 01:06:22.244
I just wanna make sure that we equally acknowledge all of our groups.

01:06:22.344 --> 01:06:32.626
I don't believe we asked the first group to stand up, so if you could please stand up, the first group that, I think it was a Berkeley Unified representative.

01:06:32.866 --> 01:06:33.966
Okay, let's give them a hand.

01:06:36.232 --> 01:06:36.792
Thank you.

01:06:38.273 --> 01:06:45.475
And if we could have the last group that just presented, if you can stand up so we can acknowledge your contributions to the research that was presented.

01:06:50.136 --> 01:06:51.756
Okay, thank you.

01:06:53.997 --> 01:06:57.298
And that final speaker.

01:07:01.004 --> 01:07:11.369
I would just like to thank you, Board and Superintendent Torlakson, once again, not just for hearing us, but for listening to us and actually pledging in that case to take action.

01:07:12.970 --> 01:07:19.753
I hope that we can shortly turn some of the proposals presented here into actions implemented by you, the State Board of Education.

01:07:20.133 --> 01:07:20.433
Thank you.

01:07:28.410 --> 01:07:30.931
So I think we'll take the 10-minute recess.

01:07:30.971 --> 01:07:40.535
We're going to take some pictures with the students, so come back in 10 minutes at 10 of 10, please.

01:07:46.117 --> 01:07:50.999
We'll present this item, which is the accountability item.

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:52.560
Good morning.

01:07:57.759 --> 01:07:58.340
Good morning.

01:07:58.480 --> 01:07:59.601
My name is Cindy Kazanis.

01:07:59.661 --> 01:08:05.048
I'm the director of the analysis measurement and accountability reporting division.

01:08:06.450 --> 01:08:08.873
People are very excited about the previous.

01:08:10.234 --> 01:08:10.895
Are you listening?

01:08:10.915 --> 01:08:12.077
All right.

01:08:14.079 --> 01:08:14.740
We'll keep moving.

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:23.261
This is the first time I've been presenting to you in my new capacity as the Director of the Analysis, Measurement, and Accountability Reporting Division.

01:08:24.161 --> 01:08:31.484
I am grateful that Carrick and Jenny were, over the past several months when I was on maternity leave, were able to keep things moving along.

01:08:31.604 --> 01:08:33.924
So we have a new accountability system.

01:08:34.444 --> 01:08:37.445
Nancy Burnell is gone, so in her stead.

01:08:37.805 --> 01:08:42.947
This is the new presentation with the department taking over.

01:08:43.987 --> 01:08:58.397
So just to provide you a little bit of brief context for the item, previous board actions on this have started out, it's probably prior to the March meeting, but the March meeting is really when you approve the architecture of the accountability and continuous improvement system.

01:08:58.957 --> 01:09:02.660
In May, you made a determination of how we created a

01:09:03.837 --> 01:09:07.180
a single coherent local, state, and federal accountability system.

01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:14.365
In July, you approved standards and performance expectations, and then finally, last meeting, you adopted the evaluation rubrics.

01:09:16.026 --> 01:09:17.908
This agenda item has five attachments.

01:09:18.368 --> 01:09:24.213
The first attachment provides an overview of the proposed performance standards for the academic indicator.

01:09:24.713 --> 01:09:30.578
Attachment two provides an approach to how to determine progress for the local performance indicators.

01:09:31.716 --> 01:09:38.340
Attachment three is an update and recommended action related to the application of the evaluation rubrics to charter schools.

01:09:40.441 --> 01:09:48.125
And then attachment four is a draft timeline for the local accountability, local, state, and federal accountability system.

01:09:48.526 --> 01:09:50.967
And then finally, as always, we include the education code.

01:09:54.049 --> 01:09:57.831
So just to briefly sort of set a little bit of context here,

01:09:59.755 --> 01:10:03.977
The items that weren't resolved by last meeting's action were the following.

01:10:04.957 --> 01:10:09.239
The board did not set performance standards for the academic indicator.

01:10:09.359 --> 01:10:18.322
We needed to take back to you how local educational agencies would collect and report progress through the LCFF evaluation rubrics for the local performance indicators.

01:10:18.842 --> 01:10:26.025
And then finally, there was a request for clarification about how the LCFF evaluation rubrics would apply to charter schools.

01:10:27.287 --> 01:10:33.272
With that in mind, there are several recommendations that we are asking the board to take.

01:10:33.372 --> 01:10:48.485
The first was to adopt, as stated in the item, to adopt performance standards for the academic indicator based on student test scores for English language, arts, literacy, and mathematics for grades three through eight, which includes the results of the second year of Smarter Balanced tests.

01:10:49.571 --> 01:11:02.782
The second recommendation in the item is to approve the proposed self-assessment tools for local educational agencies to determine progress on the local performance indicators for the following priorities.

01:11:02.902 --> 01:11:11.750
Basics, priority one, school climate, priority six, coordination of services for expelled students, priority nine, and finally the coordination of services for foster youths, priority 10.

01:11:13.587 --> 01:11:29.012
The third recommendation is to revise the approved standards for local performance indicators to clarify that LEAs must report the results of a local measurement of progress to their local governing boards at a regularly scheduled meeting of the local governing board.

01:11:30.732 --> 01:11:46.161
And then finally, the final recommendation is to add language to the criteria to determine LEA eligibility for technical assistance intervention under the LCFF statutes approved at your previous meeting, and to clarify the applicability of the criteria to charter schools.

01:11:51.764 --> 01:11:57.587
With those in mind, I have a couple things I wanted to talk to you about regarding recommendation one.

01:11:58.693 --> 01:12:02.676
Recommendation one includes proposed performance standards for the academic indicator.

01:12:03.016 --> 01:12:10.702
We base it on methodology of comparing the percent of students who are at or above standards on the Smarter Balanced assessments for English language arts and math.

01:12:11.763 --> 01:12:27.515
As we discussed at the last board meeting, we all agree that using scale scores to determine school progress is a better method than at or above, but since we only received the final data file in September after the board meeting, there was not enough time to provide you a recommendation using scale scores.

01:12:28.297 --> 01:12:33.661
I wanted to first acknowledge the work of Jenny Tseng and the Academic Accountability Unit in preparing this item.

01:12:34.901 --> 01:12:43.927
They had assistance from the Technical Design Group, the CPAG provided input, as well as WestEd, with Eric Crane providing us input.

01:12:45.608 --> 01:12:49.811
They've been providing data simulations that back up the recommendations behind this item.

01:12:50.792 --> 01:12:53.694
They produced the data, again, that I just mentioned,

01:12:56.906 --> 01:13:11.528
In doing so, we've had many discussions with board liaisons after the item was posted and are withdrawing recommendation one in order to give our staff the opportunity to review a scale score methodology and bring back a recommendation for you in January.

01:13:12.289 --> 01:13:16.590
This will be a monumental task to accomplish in the eight weeks, with a couple holidays in between.

01:13:16.930 --> 01:13:20.291
But we're committed to having all hands on deck to get this accomplished.

01:13:20.811 --> 01:13:27.952
We want to take advantage of the opportunity to see what we can do with scale scores instead of adopting a methodology that would be temporary.

01:13:28.912 --> 01:13:31.773
For today, we are only asking your action on the other three recommendations.

01:13:32.373 --> 01:13:33.834
And with that, I'm gonna move to questions.

01:13:35.494 --> 01:13:40.835
Okay, I wanna ask Board Member Burr to talk about the context for this change.

01:13:41.768 --> 01:13:54.840
Well, first, Cindy, I just want to express my appreciation to you and Carrick, and especially Jenny, for thinking very carefully about how we can move forward in a way that we hope will be a long-term solution.

01:13:54.920 --> 01:14:05.229
So I think the decision not to pull back from a specific recommendation is very much appreciated, and I'm thankful that you were able to do that.

01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:07.431
Just a couple of comments.

01:14:07.471 --> 01:14:14.919
I think, you know, it reflects what we've talked about over the last several meetings about scale scores in our view being a more appropriate

01:14:16.992 --> 01:14:34.131
because it allows you to look at all student progress along the entire continuum and moves away from what I think was a flawed methodology, actually, of percent proficient, which focused schools on kids who were on the bubble, which didn't really serve us very well.

01:14:34.212 --> 01:14:36.094
So really appreciate you doing that.

01:14:36.874 --> 01:14:45.461
I think we probably want to talk a little bit about the scales core in the context of a growth model, because we've talked about growth again for many years.

01:14:45.521 --> 01:14:52.907
I know the department's certainly been engaged in that, and look at different models that might work as we move forward.

01:14:53.867 --> 01:14:59.912
In doing that, I would just encourage you to also seek the advice of some other entities that are already doing that work.

01:15:00.492 --> 01:15:04.856
We've heard from the core districts who represent a substantial proportion of the

01:15:05.497 --> 01:15:06.881
students in California.

01:15:07.482 --> 01:15:11.072
We've also heard from the Charter Schools Association that they're working on something like that.

01:15:12.245 --> 01:15:18.049
I will say in both of those cases, I want to be clear and on record that we're not interested in a summative rating.

01:15:18.770 --> 01:15:27.756
We don't want one number to define LEAs, but I do think they're doing some interesting things with their test results and using them within a growth model.

01:15:28.577 --> 01:15:32.500
So again, I really appreciate the withdrawal of the recommendation.

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:39.845
I think it's the smart thing to do rather than to act expediently because we thought we were up against some tight deadline.

01:15:40.445 --> 01:15:47.889
but to really take the time and appreciate you and your staff's willingness to reprioritize some other work to be able to do that.

01:15:48.009 --> 01:15:48.749
So thanks again.

01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:56.192
Great, and I just wanted to mention that we are fortunate to have members of CORE and of the Charter School Association on our technical design group.

01:15:56.352 --> 01:16:08.278
And so we've had a preview over the last several meetings of what they've presented to the public, and they've provided invaluable input through the process of looking at the second year Smarter Balanced scores.

01:16:09.312 --> 01:16:11.435
Board Member Strauss worked on this also.

01:16:11.916 --> 01:16:15.981
So, Cindy, again, thanks to you and the entire department and the continued work.

01:16:16.121 --> 01:16:25.734
I think we are all really committed to trying to get this as right as we can and taking the time and understanding the urgency of helping districts use the data, but also wanting to get the best data that we can.

01:16:26.655 --> 01:16:32.559
Particularly now as we look at the approach of how the academic indicator is going to report it for the English learner group.

01:16:32.579 --> 01:16:34.940
So I think that's a key priority that we all share.

01:16:36.841 --> 01:16:42.224
We heard this at our last board meeting and we've seen it in a lot of the comments leading up to this board meeting as well.

01:16:42.604 --> 01:16:49.188
And we are very concerned that this be reflective of the actual practice and help us inform what we're going to do.

01:16:49.968 --> 01:17:10.121
What we know is historically the students who are reclassified within the past four years were reported in the Yale group, and we know that you had originally incorporated that, but the ESSA state plans, ESSA will allow us to approach, give us some discretion on how we approach this, so we're gonna need to resolve this as we develop the plan as well.

01:17:10.581 --> 01:17:14.404
So with the new timeline to incorporate scale, score, approach,

01:17:15.124 --> 01:17:16.885
we try to blend this.

01:17:16.905 --> 01:17:20.565
That's been our commitment all along, that the ESSA plan and our state work be integrated.

01:17:20.986 --> 01:17:37.250
So what we're looking forward to in January, just to clarify, is that I believe that the department is going to run data in several different ways for ELs only, ELs including students reclassified within the last two years, and including students reclassified within the last four years.

01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:38.150
So we can take a look.

01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:39.790
and what the implications are.

01:17:40.651 --> 01:17:51.733
Also I think it would be helpful because it is beginning to change the conversation from the percent proficient and the work that we did to try to move kids above into the next and look at the kids on the bubble and trying to move them in.

01:17:51.773 --> 01:18:02.456
We're really going to try to look now at growth so maybe when you come back or actually requesting when you come back in January either you part of your team or maybe WestEd in support would talk

01:18:03.036 --> 01:18:17.886
publicly to the board and to those watching us, what the change in using skill scores will allow us to do, using growth, what that means, how the conversation will change, and how it could be used in impacting both district and site practice.

01:18:17.926 --> 01:18:24.371
So as part of the bringing back the data, we'd really appreciate it if you'd add the kind of professional development piece on

01:18:24.551 --> 01:18:34.501
because we are moving and changing, but I think people are waiting to look at what we've got right now, and so I think it's gonna take a while, and I think that would help inform where we're going with this direction.

01:18:34.521 --> 01:18:47.374
And I actually believe that Member Ortiz-Lincoln has one additional comment on ELs as you're thinking about the data, so if that's okay, President Kerst, maybe you could just add so that we stay coherent on our comments.

01:18:49.316 --> 01:18:53.498
Yeah, I really appreciate that we're drawing this particular piece of the motion.

01:18:53.518 --> 01:19:07.144
I did have some concerns with including RFEP students into the EL subgroup just because I anticipate that results would look very different when you include students who reclassified four years ago with students who are still considered English learners.

01:19:07.684 --> 01:19:11.986
So I appreciate the request that member Strauss has requested.

01:19:12.286 --> 01:19:17.288
And the other request that I had made is to look at the Latino students subgroup

01:19:17.868 --> 01:19:26.631
take out the Latino EL students just to see how Latinos alone would perform if we don't have Latino ELs.

01:19:27.011 --> 01:19:38.695
I know that one of the comments made was that perhaps Latino students were performing at that low level of meeting and exceeding because of the EL student population that's embedded into that student subgroup.

01:19:39.015 --> 01:19:41.675
So I wanna see, I think that data should drive our conversations.

01:19:41.776 --> 01:19:43.036
I just wanna see to what,

01:19:43.997 --> 01:19:48.420
or to what impact are EL students having when we look at Latino students?

01:19:49.001 --> 01:19:49.321
Thank you.

01:19:51.422 --> 01:19:52.223
Board Member Rocker.

01:19:53.504 --> 01:20:01.430
Well, first of all, this just goes to prove how flexible and agile our department staff can be in handling some of these concerns.

01:20:02.151 --> 01:20:09.697
I also want to thank you, and I join my colleagues in saying I think that the work on the academic indicator created great concern.

01:20:10.198 --> 01:20:11.639
And as we look at what will,

01:20:12.499 --> 01:20:20.066
And I'm gonna be careful in asking the next question because it may be related to a different item, so I'm going to apologize ahead of time.

01:20:20.546 --> 01:20:39.922
One of the concerns that I had in looking at how the academic indicator was proposed is in making the change from the percent proficient to the scaled score, I wanted to make sure we're all so clear on what the bands or the performance bands on the scaled scores are going to be because

01:20:40.382 --> 01:20:54.349
It's not just adopting the use of the scaled score, it's understanding what's actually being reported by those performance bands that we currently have on those scale scores that define proficiency and all of those things.

01:20:54.709 --> 01:21:05.574
And so what I want to understand is then, as it applies to those particular subgroups, particularly the English learner subgroup, because as we currently constitute that group, as has been pointed out,

01:21:05.974 --> 01:21:09.898
That is the only subgroup that changes over time.

01:21:10.579 --> 01:21:15.784
As an African-American, I'm always going to be in that subgroup.

01:21:16.384 --> 01:21:29.637
And so is there a difference in the level of granularity that we can see in using the scaled scores and talking about the English learners as a subgroup so we can differentiate what the performance is among

01:21:32.104 --> 01:21:39.130
subgroups of those students that we have clustered together into that one large, very generic term of art called English learners.

01:21:39.611 --> 01:21:54.744
I also want to understand, because we're trying to create a growth model and we're also doing this reporting in the accountability system that has this two-dimensional grid on status and change, what will be the,

01:21:55.945 --> 01:22:20.684
the post that define what status is and what will be the definitions of change because that's something, it was a one-line throwaway in the original item that just simply said we're going to move from percent proficient to this scaled score without really explaining how that will actually be analyzed and then reported for those two elements on our accountability grid.

01:22:21.304 --> 01:22:29.109
And then finally, and this is maybe where I'm departing from discussion on this item to a separate item, so I'm going to apologize.

01:22:29.610 --> 01:22:38.436
There is still, as it relates to the state plan, several items that have to be considered in making this change.

01:22:38.876 --> 01:22:50.824
There is a requirement in the state plan for the state to have ambitious long-term and interim goals that define academic achievement as measured by proficiency.

01:22:51.484 --> 01:23:09.278
So if we're changing the term of art to be what we're using on the scaled scores and moving away from the percent proficient, if the goal is still to maintain the single uniform accountability system, how do you make those two terms of art meet someplace?

01:23:09.338 --> 01:23:11.560
Where is the overlap or where is the touch point?

01:23:13.041 --> 01:23:14.742
Let me just interject on the question.

01:23:16.324 --> 01:23:23.675
My understanding is the proficiency issue is still, you know, draft regulation and under a lot of consideration.

01:23:23.795 --> 01:23:26.940
So it's possible it might be withdrawn.

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:29.484
So I don't think we want to spend a super amount of time

01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:31.441
if it might be.

01:23:31.801 --> 01:23:33.362
Okay, go ahead.

01:23:33.662 --> 01:23:44.807
And then, again, going back to the relationship on English learners, because we're, again, going to use those scaled scores, is there a difference in what progress can look like for that subgroup?

01:23:45.248 --> 01:23:59.355
In other words, I'm hoping that we're not going to write the definition of progress in the growth model with one broad brush stroke without considering if we have some flexibility to define progress for that subgroup.

01:24:00.115 --> 01:24:06.644
And I don't mean differently as in with a lower standard, but understanding or identifying what that metric would mean.

01:24:07.244 --> 01:24:14.734
And then there's a requirement also in the state plan that there is substantial weight given to this indicator.

01:24:15.194 --> 01:24:35.585
So we want to understand both in the accountability system when you create this reporting on status and change, also what that substantial weight then would look like with all of the other indicators, including the academic indicator, and what constitutes substantial and what constitutes much greater.

01:24:37.806 --> 01:24:50.512
You don't have to come back with that in January, but I'd like to know that there's some thinking going along with that to try to understand, again, how those things will meet together, where the tangent point is on those elements as well.

01:24:53.334 --> 01:24:54.914
Okay, does someone have an easier question?

01:24:58.236 --> 01:24:58.396
No.

01:24:58.416 --> 01:25:00.077
Cara Cashly, Deputy Superintendent.

01:25:01.037 --> 01:25:05.680
So I wanted us to say a couple things from a bigger picture perspective.

01:25:06.661 --> 01:25:10.104
and that is there's a lot of different kind of reporting that goes on.

01:25:10.944 --> 01:25:14.967
We've got individual student reports that go home to parents.

01:25:15.508 --> 01:25:18.110
We've got data that we post on our website.

01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:21.052
We've got the reporting that's required by the U.S.

01:25:21.092 --> 01:25:23.354
Department of Education that we send to them.

01:25:23.814 --> 01:25:25.375
There's requirements from the U.S.

01:25:25.415 --> 01:25:28.658
Department of Education that we post on our own website.

01:25:29.498 --> 01:25:30.679
They still have this

01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:36.682
this requirement of looking at students, again, proficient or above.

01:25:37.162 --> 01:25:42.704
So that data is posted with our assessment scores.

01:25:43.524 --> 01:25:48.966
And we do have to address how we're going to meet those requirements from a federal perspective.

01:25:49.446 --> 01:25:57.469
And then we have how we're going to use this data to measure schools in our accountability system.

01:25:59.270 --> 01:26:00.452
And some of those may be separate.

01:26:00.492 --> 01:26:06.098
And then we have the requirement of the school accountability report card, which has to demonstrate other information.

01:26:06.458 --> 01:26:12.144
So we just need to be we need to separate out a little bit how we're going to meet these different requirements.

01:26:13.806 --> 01:26:27.336
Right now we're talking about the evaluation rubrics, and we will get, as President Kerr said, you know, once we have final regulations and all and we finalize our state plan, we'll address how we're going to meet some of those federal standards.

01:26:27.956 --> 01:26:31.159
The other point I wanted to make was that I don't want to

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:39.663
overly criticize or demonize the proficiency levels that we have with our assessment scores.

01:26:40.183 --> 01:26:54.230
Those proficiency levels are very helpful for communicating to parents and to others where their child is, right, or where a number of groups of students are in terms of status.

01:26:54.630 --> 01:27:01.473
That doesn't mean that that's the measure we want to use in our accountability system as we measure school's progress, but it's important information

01:27:02.935 --> 01:27:05.198
for parents and for communities to take a look at.

01:27:06.039 --> 01:27:10.766
But we want to use what's most appropriate for measuring schools in our accountability system.

01:27:12.031 --> 01:27:22.017
The one difficulty or one of the difficulties with scale scores is exactly some of the issues that you've brought up in how are we going to communicate?

01:27:22.057 --> 01:27:24.338
What is the meaning behind that, right?

01:27:24.598 --> 01:27:28.661
We had proficiency levels, and we know what the meanings are behind those proficiency levels.

01:27:28.981 --> 01:27:34.244
When we say, you know, the school or the student has a score of 2250, what's the meaning behind that?

01:27:36.665 --> 01:27:50.251
And explaining that meaning to schools and communities as part of this accountability system will be a harder thing to do because the at or above proficiency is pretty easy to understand.

01:27:50.631 --> 01:27:57.434
Scale scores won't be as easy, but we do need to come back with what the meaning behind those scores are.

01:27:58.490 --> 01:28:08.917
So to that point, and I think Member Strauss mentioned working with WestEd, we have reached out to WestEd to help us develop a communication of sorts to our various audiences.

01:28:08.977 --> 01:28:10.899
And again, we're on an aggressive time frame.

01:28:10.919 --> 01:28:16.423
We're going to get to as much as we can in anticipation of a posting prior to the New Year's holiday.

01:28:17.063 --> 01:28:20.325
But we may end up with the blue, who knows.

01:28:20.405 --> 01:28:25.389
But there's going to be a lot of work going on over the next eight weeks to meet these needs.

01:28:27.749 --> 01:28:29.390
Okay, other board comments?

01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:30.251
Board Member Sun.

01:28:30.791 --> 01:28:38.315
So I am in support of delaying the recommendation until the department has a chance to look at the sales score data.

01:28:39.356 --> 01:28:47.140
What is the implication of this to getting information out, the first rubric out to LEAs and schools?

01:28:49.950 --> 01:28:53.073
So we are in communication with the California Collaborative.

01:28:53.174 --> 01:28:57.999
They have their first training, ironically, today across the street at the convention center.

01:28:58.739 --> 01:29:07.669
You know, they are really focused on getting our professionals in the classroom and at the district level and I think members of the public familiar with

01:29:08.349 --> 01:29:10.251
the evaluation rubric in general.

01:29:11.032 --> 01:29:17.659
They are aware of this recommendation to withdraw this action from today's board item.

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:21.663
It could mean that the public release of the evaluation rubrics may be delayed.

01:29:22.484 --> 01:29:22.985
I don't know.

01:29:23.065 --> 01:29:28.831
There's a lot of moving parts right now, and until we really get our hands on the data, we're not going to have a clear,

01:29:30.232 --> 01:29:32.454
a set timeframe ready to go.

01:29:32.494 --> 01:29:40.959
But I think the intention is to get them out as soon as possible, but we want to get them out thoughtfully and not have what I think Board Member Burr say is drive the conversation.

01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:43.361
So I've seen a preview of their presentation.

01:29:43.401 --> 01:29:46.723
They spend a lot of time talking about the performance categories.

01:29:46.763 --> 01:29:49.725
I think I saw 13 slides on the colors, which is great.

01:29:49.785 --> 01:29:55.449
I think people will walk away from that presentation really understanding the elements of the rubrics.

01:29:55.589 --> 01:29:57.931
And the data will come, it will definitely come.

01:29:58.371 --> 01:30:02.235
And I think as Carrick also mentioned, districts have this data right now too.

01:30:02.515 --> 01:30:08.741
So they can, they should be making decisions based on their Smarter Balanced data appropriately.

01:30:08.981 --> 01:30:11.103
Yeah, and I would completely agree with that.

01:30:11.143 --> 01:30:17.288
I know the department, we've been doing a lot of workshops around the evaluation rubrics.

01:30:18.309 --> 01:30:30.609
I don't think we can do enough of them, because while we are very close to this, I think there's still a lot of information that we need to push out to the field and explain what this is before we launch with actual data.

01:30:34.382 --> 01:30:36.963
Now, do you want to continue on the other items?

01:30:36.983 --> 01:30:38.343
The other items, I didn't.

01:30:38.504 --> 01:30:40.004
I was only asking for a question.

01:30:40.044 --> 01:30:42.725
I think that the attachments really explain themselves.

01:30:42.745 --> 01:30:49.488
So we're going to consider from the motion only two, three and four is now part of the motion.

01:30:50.609 --> 01:30:51.749
One is delayed.

01:30:51.810 --> 01:30:52.510
Board Member Burr.

01:30:54.761 --> 01:31:01.388
I just want to more fully understand the recommendations relative to the local indicators.

01:31:03.030 --> 01:31:05.934
And so that is for people who want to take a look at that.

01:31:05.954 --> 01:31:10.659
Maybe you know it off the top of your head, Cindy, which attachment it is.

01:31:10.839 --> 01:31:13.502
Attachment two, so page one of eight.

01:31:15.204 --> 01:31:18.549
I'm not entirely sure what the recommendation is, I guess.

01:31:18.589 --> 01:31:28.925
I know the recommendation is to adopt essentially what's embodied in this item, but I'll just state a couple things about the local indicators that I'm a little concerned about.

01:31:29.025 --> 01:31:29.586
I think that

01:31:31.847 --> 01:31:40.429
There's a lot of things unknown about many of the priorities, and we've got work groups going on about how to, particularly around school climate and some of the other priorities.

01:31:41.050 --> 01:31:50.152
But I think that there is kind of an unstated expectation in the item that they will ultimately become state indicators.

01:31:50.752 --> 01:31:55.373
And I just want to say, at least for me, that this is supposed to be a mixed system.

01:31:55.853 --> 01:31:58.534
There are state indicators, there are local indicators.

01:31:59.354 --> 01:32:03.257
We will ultimately have federal pieces that will all be part of this.

01:32:04.017 --> 01:32:09.401
And with respect to local indicators, the reason they are local is because they're very contextual.

01:32:09.921 --> 01:32:13.804
Remember, we have a district in Siskiyou County that's got five kids in it.

01:32:14.444 --> 01:32:21.068
and there's no way that that district should be meeting the same expectation as the LA Unified School District.

01:32:21.348 --> 01:32:28.712
We just have way too much breadth and geographic diversity, population density, et cetera.

01:32:29.492 --> 01:32:31.975
So that's why a mixed system makes sense to me.

01:32:32.735 --> 01:32:43.185
Having said that, we want to provide some guidance, which is what we did when we created the structure for local indicators about identifying the evidence, say whether or not you met it or you didn't.

01:32:43.746 --> 01:32:49.071
But what I'm worried about in this recommendation is we're tightening the noose on local indicators.

01:32:49.691 --> 01:32:54.272
And so I want to make sure I understand what the recommendation is, because I might be off base here.

01:32:54.812 --> 01:33:02.874
But we're starting to make it look a lot more, as I told Carrie, the coordinated compliance manual, which we're desperately trying to get away from.

01:33:03.455 --> 01:33:16.318
So I just want to make sure that embedded in this recommendation is the option for districts to choose their local evidence and their local tools for meeting these local indicators.

01:33:17.538 --> 01:33:30.164
because the way I read it, it's making it sound like, especially on a couple of priorities, they're losing that option, that we're going to tell them what the instrument is, how often they measure, et cetera.

01:33:30.224 --> 01:33:32.926
So can you help me understand what the recommendation is?

01:33:32.946 --> 01:33:37.388
Dave's gonna help me understand the recommendation.

01:33:38.135 --> 01:33:41.416
Hi, David Sapp, Deputy Policy Director with the State Board of Education.

01:33:41.616 --> 01:34:03.725
The recommendation in this item addresses only four of the local performance indicators, so it's for the basics, which is sort of the Williams Settlement provisions, priority one, priority six, which is the school climate, the local climate survey local indicator, and then the two county office priorities, the coordination of services for expelled youth,

01:34:04.205 --> 01:34:06.247
and coordination of services for foster youth.

01:34:06.708 --> 01:34:11.293
There's still two local performance indicators that are not addressed as part of this recommendation.

01:34:11.773 --> 01:34:17.659
Those have to do with the implementation of state academic standards and the parent engagement priorities.

01:34:17.739 --> 01:34:20.943
Those, we're gonna come back in January with an update on those two priorities.

01:34:21.643 --> 01:34:28.525
For the four that are addressed as part of this recommendation, the first has to do with the basics, the Williams settlement.

01:34:29.085 --> 01:34:32.086
Those data are currently collected and reported through the SARC.

01:34:32.646 --> 01:34:35.547
That's sort of something that districts have been reporting for years.

01:34:36.107 --> 01:34:46.850
The proposal is that because the web-based system for the rubrics is the same platform as the SARC template that the department has developed, it's all in the same data system,

01:34:47.450 --> 01:34:55.118
that the way to collect and report out that information through the rubrics is to basically take the same data in the SARC and report it through the rubrics.

01:34:55.138 --> 01:35:00.104
So it's essentially transferring that data into this reporting platform.

01:35:00.965 --> 01:35:05.049
For the local climate survey, which is priority six,

01:35:06.090 --> 01:35:22.211
The proposal in the item is that there's a text box with prompts that an LEA would summarize what the findings from the local survey tool that they have used, and so there's flexibility for the LEA to use different survey tools.

01:35:22.451 --> 01:35:24.473
So it does provide for that flexibility.

01:35:25.214 --> 01:35:39.551
For the two remaining priorities, the County Office of Education priority areas, there is a proposed self-assessment tool which has between six and 10 prompts, for lack of a better term, that each have a rating scale.

01:35:40.151 --> 01:35:53.274
And so the method of collecting and reporting information that's proposed in the recommendation for those two priorities is that the county would complete those self-assessments through the web-based system.

01:35:53.414 --> 01:36:04.357
So it's basically like a web form, and the LEA would collect and do their own local collection of how they're doing on those elements, and then report it out using that self-assessment tool.

01:36:04.977 --> 01:36:08.918
That tool, a staff from the department and state board staff

01:36:09.398 --> 01:36:31.517
worked with representatives from county offices, and for the foster youth, went also with some foster youth advocates, and there was strong consensus from all parties that those were the right questions to be looking at, and that it would be a very helpful tool for counties to be using, because it tracks basically those statutory elements that are part of the priorities that are defined under LCFF for counties.

01:36:32.118 --> 01:36:34.359
So for these four priorities,

01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:43.768
proposed local assessment tools, the way that the information is collected and reported does differ from priority to priority.

01:36:43.788 --> 01:36:49.794
So there is that sort of flexibility for choosing the different surveys for the local climate survey.

01:36:50.294 --> 01:36:58.238
whereas for the Williams Settlement Priority One, there are specific parts that are required that are already reported, so it's pulling those out and just reporting it in.

01:36:58.258 --> 01:37:02.201
And then there's a standard self-assessment tool for the two county office ones.

01:37:02.621 --> 01:37:11.606
I think to respond directly to Board Member Burr's question about whether the recommendation as to these four local assessment tools

01:37:12.346 --> 01:37:18.751
is sort of being used as a framework for the proposal that will come forward on priorities two and three.

01:37:18.771 --> 01:37:30.338
I think just to be clear, we are continuing that conversation with stakeholders and that as you will see in these four proposed tools, there are differences in how it's being done.

01:37:30.779 --> 01:37:36.803
And so there's no specific proposal at this time that there would be one approach or that it would be open-ended.

01:37:36.843 --> 01:37:41.886
That's something we're continuing to work on and we'll come back with a recommendation hopefully at the January meeting.

01:37:43.847 --> 01:37:44.948
So thanks, Dave.

01:37:45.008 --> 01:37:46.009
That was very helpful.

01:37:46.029 --> 01:37:55.416
I'll just say for me, I hope that as we come forward with the other two priorities, we provide as much flexibility as possible at the local level.

01:37:55.816 --> 01:38:03.422
I know we're aware through CPAG that there are districts that have their own tools, they're comfortable with their own tools, they've been using them.

01:38:03.982 --> 01:38:07.245
I don't think we want to come in and say, no, you need to do something different.

01:38:08.386 --> 01:38:23.464
But I also, there's a recommendation on page three that I just, I don't think you addressed, and I just want to make sure that this is part of the recommendation, that we would be requiring LEAs to designate a representative to compile and coordinate feedback.

01:38:23.904 --> 01:38:25.165
Is that part of the recommendation?

01:38:26.026 --> 01:38:32.471
and present the results to the local governing board, and then determine the performance, which I think is already required.

01:38:32.792 --> 01:38:39.637
But the first part about designating a representative to compile and coordinate, is that part of the recommendation?

01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:45.401
So I'm gonna take this, because it's more of just a technical design of how you get information in the rubrics.

01:38:46.001 --> 01:38:52.183
There is really a back-end coordinator, we're calling it the rubrics coordinator, to push up data.

01:38:52.283 --> 01:38:58.024
So keep in mind for the local performance measures, we're not using CALPADS to pull data.

01:38:58.064 --> 01:39:00.445
We're asking districts to put data in that is

01:39:00.885 --> 01:39:02.066
you know, it's a self-assessment.

01:39:02.086 --> 01:39:07.389
So this is just merely a technical person, but I would not send it to the CALPADS coordinator.

01:39:07.409 --> 01:39:14.233
I'd send it to somebody who is maybe on the CISC, a CISC kind of person, a curriculum person to upload that information.

01:39:14.513 --> 01:39:17.975
So I'll just say this is kind of my ongoing concern about

01:39:18.975 --> 01:39:20.476
We're a policy board, right?

01:39:20.516 --> 01:39:22.038
We're supposed to be setting policy.

01:39:22.378 --> 01:39:30.424
And I know that we were given this big job about implementing LCFF, but I worry that what keeps creeping in here is very micromanaging.

01:39:31.245 --> 01:39:39.031
And I get that you guys, you know, ask for testing coordinators and all that, but I don't know that in a board action we want to be embedding

01:39:39.691 --> 01:39:47.057
Again, micromanagement that is going to be uniformly applied to a state like ours.

01:39:47.137 --> 01:39:49.919
So I would just really guard against that if I could.

01:39:49.939 --> 01:39:51.460
Yeah, point well taken.

01:39:52.481 --> 01:39:58.186
And I just wanted to add on to Cindy Kazanis' comments in terms of the coordinator.

01:39:58.206 --> 01:40:01.128
So this is the person that would be communicated with.

01:40:01.728 --> 01:40:11.331
when it's time to upload something or to notify them there's a new survey that you can use or who's going to upload that local data for them.

01:40:11.671 --> 01:40:14.552
Right now, they already have a SARC coordinator.

01:40:15.052 --> 01:40:28.176
And since the SARC design is the same as this design, designed by the same people, in most cases, the SARC coordinator and the LCFF evaluation coordinator is probably going to be the same person because they're going to be the same one uploading the data.

01:40:30.129 --> 01:40:30.970
This is the action.

01:40:30.990 --> 01:40:33.873
It doesn't actually specify a person or a coordinator.

01:40:33.953 --> 01:40:48.791
I think that we got into more detail in the attachment to allow for members of the public to better understand how this would occur, but this also points to the process in vetting the results through a group.

01:40:49.111 --> 01:41:02.524
And that, I think, is appropriate, but here's, again, my concern, not to beat a dead horse, but by us taking action on this and referring to attachment two, I would assume that people could rightly say, well, attachment two says all of these things.

01:41:02.624 --> 01:41:06.328
I'm sorry, the attachment two is my cheat sheet.

01:41:06.348 --> 01:41:07.869
This is not actually in the recommendation.

01:41:09.170 --> 01:41:13.033
the word attachment to is something I added as a reference point.

01:41:13.533 --> 01:41:14.474
It's not in your recommendation.

01:41:14.534 --> 01:41:18.416
Okay, so all we're being asked to do is the local governing board piece.

01:41:18.476 --> 01:41:21.598
That's correct, as well as approving the tools.

01:41:22.799 --> 01:41:24.680
Okay.

01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:26.841
Okay, these follow up on these issues.

01:41:27.382 --> 01:41:30.864
Okay, could Board Member Ruckers first, and Board Member Ortiz will come.

01:41:32.199 --> 01:41:40.569
Okay, so I appreciate also, David, I want to thank you for giving the clarification on the issues related to the local indicators.

01:41:41.009 --> 01:41:47.857
I agree with Board Member Burr about the issue of not only the flexibility for locals but

01:41:48.918 --> 01:42:09.493
I think the intermediary agent on this is what will county offices who have the responsibility of vetting and approving these plans and understanding these local indicators, they will have multiple LCAPs that will have multiple different types of local indicators.

01:42:10.013 --> 01:42:22.942
Somewhere on the continuum of flexibility, there's these mileposts of complete deregulation and salutary neglect and the type of micromanaging that Board Member Burr is concerned about.

01:42:22.982 --> 01:42:34.950
I don't think the micromanaging, though, is coming at this level from the Board because I'm very clear that the policy that's defined in this action really is a policy.

01:42:35.811 --> 01:42:48.836
I think that county officers are going to look at the notes that you have written in attachment to and see some unintended learning outcomes from what will be implemented here.

01:42:49.296 --> 01:42:53.918
And so, you know, as a former classroom teacher, I understand those unintended learning outcomes.

01:42:53.958 --> 01:42:59.220
The example I always use is when I taught my students about the American Revolution of the 13 colonies.

01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:08.746
I had students who legitimately thought there was only one African American who lived in the colonies at that time, and it was a guy named Crispus Attucks, because that's the only one they saw.

01:43:09.166 --> 01:43:29.160
So there will be some unintended outcomes from the notes that are provided without clear guidance to county offices, so they don't do the type of micromanaging and insisting, well, this is what I have to see and understand about your local indicators in order for us to say that you're doing the work or you've considered the evidence,

01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:30.621
inappropriate ways.

01:43:30.661 --> 01:43:36.684
So I think that that's part, I read the same thing, but I'm not as concerned about what the state is saying.

01:43:37.084 --> 01:43:49.691
I'm more concerned about how the collaborative will be able to work with county offices to help them understanding, with their understanding about what they're vetting, what they're approving, particularly for the county office and their own two indicators.

01:43:50.091 --> 01:43:53.333
So I do, I think I'm very grateful for this conversation.

01:43:54.313 --> 01:43:55.454
Board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

01:43:58.260 --> 01:44:00.582
I think I'm a little bit on the other side.

01:44:00.602 --> 01:44:20.639
I don't believe in micromanaging, but I also don't believe in laissez-faire, because this item in particular, not this item, but this topic of the accountability tools and the local indicators lacked a lot of detail in some of the previous memos that I saw, and I want to thank the California Practitioners Advisory Group

01:44:21.099 --> 01:44:31.867
for putting some systems in there that made it a lot more transparent and provided some inroads for stakeholders to provide feedback for the local indicators.

01:44:33.528 --> 01:44:39.492
I think the first memo that I read, it was somebody was supposed to complete the local indicators.

01:44:39.712 --> 01:44:41.313
Who that person was was unknown.

01:44:41.793 --> 01:44:46.797
What that protocol was intended to do was unknown, and there was no stakeholder's feedback.

01:44:47.237 --> 01:45:09.022
And so this really provides some guardrails so that it is understood that this is a collaborative process, a transparent process that allows parents, students, other community stakeholders to have an input on what we think our district is doing based on the local indicators and how we would assess if we're actually doing that.

01:45:09.682 --> 01:45:12.763
When I looked at the accountability tool or the evidence,

01:45:13.740 --> 01:45:14.721
I don't think it's evidence.

01:45:14.761 --> 01:45:16.142
I think it's an accountability tool.

01:45:16.462 --> 01:45:20.786
Evidence would be to look at this is what we're doing, and here's the evidence.

01:45:20.866 --> 01:45:21.386
I'm writing.

01:45:21.426 --> 01:45:23.968
I'm providing some evidence that we're actually doing that.

01:45:24.549 --> 01:45:29.433
The accountability tool is simply a reporting tool, and it's a self-reporting mechanism.

01:45:29.513 --> 01:45:30.094
It's not really

01:45:30.854 --> 01:45:34.915
asking the districts to provide evidence, but rather to self-evaluate.

01:45:35.616 --> 01:45:43.758
So in fact, I was a little bit concerned that it was too loose and not providing a lot of evidence for the rating they were providing themselves.

01:45:44.118 --> 01:45:54.922
So again, I think that we do need to provide some guidance, and I want to make sure that this process really is adhering to the intent of having a collaborative, transparent process.

01:45:55.182 --> 01:45:55.422
Thank you.

01:45:57.177 --> 01:46:00.959
I also have a comment on the clarification just on the climate one.

01:46:01.079 --> 01:46:14.105
As I understand it, we were going to help local districts by vetting some instruments and just saying these look valid and reliable or giving them some guidance.

01:46:14.125 --> 01:46:19.108
That didn't emerge clearly to me in the attachment.

01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:29.073
And what was repeatedly referred to as a healthy kid survey, as if that's the only thing that we recommend at this point.

01:46:29.173 --> 01:46:36.837
And I have my reservations about that particular survey as inclusiveness for climate.

01:46:36.897 --> 01:46:39.999
So can you clarify that?

01:46:40.879 --> 01:46:47.263
What is our role in assisting in this development of these indicators?

01:46:48.226 --> 01:46:49.007
Thank you, President Coors.

01:46:49.047 --> 01:46:53.771
That's a great question, and we have put together a school conditions and climate work group.

01:46:54.172 --> 01:47:03.101
It's a great team of people, includes some recognized experts in determining validity of surveys and other instruments, and that group has met three times.

01:47:04.282 --> 01:47:09.487
We're gonna be meeting in person on November 28th, and in the afternoon of November 28th, we'll be having a

01:47:09.887 --> 01:47:15.110
an expanded stakeholder meeting, so anyone that would like to attend and be part of that work is cordially invited.

01:47:15.690 --> 01:47:25.375
And one of the tasks that that group has begun to take on is the vetting and kind of taking a look at what are the different tools that are out there in order to get some of that information out to the field.

01:47:26.075 --> 01:47:26.435
Okay.

01:47:27.316 --> 01:47:32.799
Yeah, the item reads like an endorsement of Healthy Kids Survey to me too much, and so that concerns me.

01:47:32.839 --> 01:47:34.099
Board Member Ortiz-Lacombe.

01:47:35.580 --> 01:47:35.940
Mr. Price.

01:47:37.341 --> 01:47:39.242
Do you have students in that work group?

01:47:40.721 --> 01:47:47.604
We don't as of yet, but we're looking at ways to get students integrated, and I was also listening with great interest today.

01:47:47.664 --> 01:47:57.508
Definitely, and I asked for some copies of that, of the report, so we could circulate that to members of the work group, but also maybe get the California Association of Student Councils involved, and other students as well.

01:47:57.528 --> 01:48:04.291
We've been talking to Youth Truth, for example, is another organization that's doing some great work around how to incorporate student input.

01:48:05.132 --> 01:48:05.572
Great, thank you.

01:48:06.693 --> 01:48:12.837
Okay, other board comments, or I'm sure we have public comments, so maybe we'll have another round after public comment.

01:48:14.178 --> 01:48:15.999
Okay, we're ready with the public comment then.

01:48:20.001 --> 01:48:21.922
We have 44 public commenters.

01:48:22.643 --> 01:48:24.484
Would the following people please line up?

01:48:24.784 --> 01:48:35.971
Rico Tamayo, Doug McRae, Patty Scripter, Rick Miller, Daisy Gonzalez, Carlos Sanchez, Sarah Valencia, Keisha McGee,

01:48:37.970 --> 01:48:48.466
Castillo, Cynthia Flores, Maria Guzman, Pastor Rick Alanis, Cecilia Villegas, Katana Valenzuela, Sergio Luna, and Brian Rivas.

01:49:02.386 --> 01:49:07.488
Good morning, President Kirst, esteemed board members, Superintendent Torlakson.

01:49:08.029 --> 01:49:15.632
My name is Rico Tamayo, and I'm president of the Early Childhood TK-12 Council for the California Federation of Teachers.

01:49:16.233 --> 01:49:26.778
And real quick, to go full circle, President Kirst, I took a class with yourself and David Tyak back in 1988, so I blame you for getting me into this position.

01:49:27.788 --> 01:49:49.016
In any case, the California Federation of Teachers urges the state school board to maintain its strong commitment to establishing a single, coherent accountability and continuous improvement system for all of California's diverse public school students, regardless of where they attend school.

01:49:49.776 --> 01:49:50.357
The CFT

01:49:51.377 --> 01:50:09.230
urges board members to stay the course and ensure that charters are subject to holistic and multidimensional evaluations, as well as to clarify that charter schools will be required to complete all applicable local indicators, including self-assessments.

01:50:09.270 --> 01:50:09.851
Thank you very much.

01:50:17.177 --> 01:50:17.618
Good morning.

01:50:17.678 --> 01:50:20.680
I'm Doug McRae, a retired testing specialist.

01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:26.944
I submitted a handout to your electronic folder last week with suggested revisions for attachment one.

01:50:29.420 --> 01:50:43.885
Briefly, for the status points, the revisions are based on the percent met and above metrics using 2016 Smarter Mailings results as baseline, but increasing targets by two percentage points per year to reflect typical year-to-year increases.

01:50:44.505 --> 01:50:52.768
This choice does not preclude use of scale scores for growth model analyses in the future with percent metrics used as the reporting purpose.

01:50:53.548 --> 01:51:05.195
For change scores, the revisions are based on Bob Lynn's 2004 findings on change scores for statewide tests, and they recognize the need for wider cut score bands for medium and small school districts.

01:51:05.875 --> 01:51:09.718
The handout provides specifics based upon these design principles.

01:51:09.938 --> 01:51:16.101
I'd ask the State Board to evaluate these revisions, which appears to be what you are doing today.

01:51:16.702 --> 01:51:16.942
Thank you.

01:51:21.854 --> 01:51:22.194
Good morning.

01:51:22.234 --> 01:51:23.954
Rick Miller, executive director of the core districts.

01:51:24.014 --> 01:51:32.256
I want to thank the board for the conversation around growth and just sort of say we want to reiterate the importance from our perspective of adding growth for our measures.

01:51:32.316 --> 01:51:34.217
And so we sort of call the power of two.

01:51:34.657 --> 01:51:40.958
And frankly, the difference between scale and scale and proficiency is much less important than looking at one of them and growth together.

01:51:40.978 --> 01:51:44.879
And when you combine the two, there's enormous power as we begin to roll this out to

01:51:45.299 --> 01:52:02.169
The 1.8 million kids across the state of California, the conversation we're having at the local level has completely changed, and you find teachers and principals who have what would appear to be well-performing schools that are actually outperforming in meaningful ways, and it can change a conversation and allow you to really focus on where you need to put the most assistance.

01:52:02.189 --> 01:52:02.970
So there's power of two.

01:52:03.630 --> 01:52:18.038
can be critical in moving forward and that's also why we continue to think as we roll out our growth measures, we look at social emotional learning and culture climate in schools and our high school readiness indicators that being part of a research pilot so we can continue to try things, learn from them and bring them back.

01:52:18.078 --> 01:52:29.405
We're also happy to have this conversation, look forward to it with the board around the policy decisions for a growth model because how you consider growth is a policy decision and then technically you want to implement but making the policy is critical.

01:52:29.565 --> 01:52:29.845
Thank you.

01:52:33.812 --> 01:52:40.298
Good morning, Dr. Gonzalez with Policy Analysis for California, PACE, based out of Stanford University, USC, and UC Davis.

01:52:40.818 --> 01:52:50.667
PACE is just really grateful for all of the work that you have done, and today we're here to urge you to really consider how the core districts and our core PACE research partnership can help the decisions that you're making.

01:52:51.127 --> 01:52:55.188
PACE recently released a report called Local Control and Action, which we mailed to all of you.

01:52:55.629 --> 01:53:05.032
And one of the key findings from that report, what the report does is it evaluates the implementation process of the core districts and their ability to really implement an accountability system.

01:53:05.652 --> 01:53:11.694
And what we found was one, to Member Burr's comments, was that flexibility was key to their ability to do their work.

01:53:12.654 --> 01:53:17.356
Every school district implemented the core district's indicators, but flexibility was key.

01:53:17.716 --> 01:53:25.058
The second thing is that school administrators really valued the emphasis of measuring growth and student achievement across multiple measures.

01:53:25.098 --> 01:53:28.219
This was particularly important for low-performing schools.

01:53:28.700 --> 01:53:40.984
And the last key thing from that report is really that in order to succeed and to build an integrated system, capacity building is gonna be key, particularly in helping schools understand and respond to data.

01:53:41.144 --> 01:53:41.444
Thank you.

01:53:46.845 --> 01:53:48.906
Patty Scripter, California State PTA.

01:53:49.666 --> 01:53:53.128
We appreciate the move of scale scores to January.

01:53:53.229 --> 01:54:03.895
I know it is a communication issue that was discussed, and I believe PTA would be happy to commit to working with you the same way we did on California Standards and Assessment in getting that important information to parents.

01:54:04.575 --> 01:54:06.936
And also I want to comment on the local flexibility issue.

01:54:06.976 --> 01:54:24.262
It is important and it is critical, but also I appreciate member Ortiz-Lincon's comment that we do need to set up some minimum standards of communication, and that's why we think it's really important that there's a clarification about the need to communicate the information at a board meeting where public comment is allowed.

01:54:25.763 --> 01:54:35.370
We also think that the CPAC recommendations were great, but we suggest substituting should instead of could coordinate with.

01:54:35.790 --> 01:54:44.397
Should is not must, but it is really a clear guidance to that this is really reflecting the way that the LCAP and LCFF should work, and that's through outreach and engagement.

01:54:45.137 --> 01:54:45.698
Thank you very much.

01:55:01.876 --> 01:55:02.736
Good morning, board members.

01:55:02.916 --> 01:55:04.037
My name is Carlos Sanchez.

01:55:04.117 --> 01:55:06.918
I am a leader with PICO California in the state of San Bernardino.

01:55:07.518 --> 01:55:10.399
PICO has 19 federations across the state of California.

01:55:10.819 --> 01:55:21.923
We are a multi-faith and multi-racial organization that strives to develop local leadership from our congregations, schools, and communities to work with racial, social, and economic justice.

01:55:22.704 --> 01:55:31.267
Together, we represent over 480 congregations and 450,000 families of diverse economic, racial, and religious backgrounds.

01:55:32.984 --> 01:55:35.265
rooted in 18 school districts across California.

01:55:36.286 --> 01:55:53.977
We thank you for your commitment on parent engagement, and school climate has a key indicator for Rubik's, and we ask you to include parent engagement's menu of evidence-based measures in the adoption of LCFF Rubik's so it could be used this school year.

01:55:54.498 --> 01:55:54.758
Thank you.

01:56:02.469 --> 01:56:04.311
Good morning, my name is Sara Valencia.

01:56:04.872 --> 01:56:13.121
Pico California would like to thank President Kurt, the State Board of Education and State Board staff for all your hard work and commitment to parents and students of California.

01:56:13.582 --> 01:56:21.130
We would also like to give special thanks to board member Bruce Holliday, Dr. Nicolasa Sandoval and Dr. Eileen Strauss.

01:56:21.611 --> 01:56:21.691
In 2012,

01:56:22.952 --> 01:56:32.394
Pico, California, led the largest volunteer voter engagement effort in support of the passage of Prop 20 in this state, turning out 67,000 voters to support the passage.

01:56:32.854 --> 01:56:45.837
Following its passage, Pico, California, has participated in the effort to pass the local control funding formula to ensure that LCFF achieves the goal of creating improved outcomes for low-income students, English learners, and foster youth.

01:56:46.417 --> 01:56:46.917
foster youth.

01:56:47.358 --> 01:56:58.204
Pico California's 19 federations are getting contacted over 250,000 voters to support Proposition 55 to ensure we continue receiving LCFF funding until 2030.

01:56:58.825 --> 01:57:10.832
We thank you for your commitment to parent engagement and school climate as a key indicator for the rubrics and we ask to include parent engagement menu of evidence-based measures and adoption of the LCFF rubric so it can be used this school year.

01:57:11.453 --> 01:57:11.773
Thank you.

01:57:24.967 --> 01:57:26.448
Good morning to all.

01:57:26.848 --> 01:57:33.810
My name is Cristina Castillo and I'm a leader of PICO with OCL and I come from the District of Santa Ana.

01:57:34.770 --> 01:57:38.751
Many times parents are not listened to by the staff.

01:57:55.768 --> 01:58:10.453
Cuando existen cosas muy serias, los estudiantes se sienten intimidados, olvidados, y los padres a su vez

01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:32.286
There are many times when serious incidences occur at schools that students are not listened to and forgotten, and the parents feel threatened because we are not listened to either.

01:58:41.110 --> 01:58:53.422
When I asked about the fact that a supervisor was yelling at my daughters, I immediately received a call from the police and I was treated like a criminal.

01:59:04.810 --> 01:59:12.831
I felt powerless to advocate for my children by feeling powerless from the same school.

01:59:14.112 --> 01:59:23.653
I'm asking that there be a center for parents at the school where their concerns can be attended to immediately.

01:59:23.673 --> 01:59:24.233
Thank you.

01:59:43.140 --> 01:59:48.244
Good morning, my name is Cynthia Flores and I am with Pico, California in Costa Mesa.

01:59:49.104 --> 01:59:56.369
Our schools and our districts have a uniform way to measure on how well they involve parents and students throughout my, parents and students.

01:59:56.749 --> 02:00:03.294
Throughout my years in public schools, I have had different experiences with parent engagement and student engagement.

02:00:04.835 --> 02:00:07.056
A school is like a second parent.

02:00:07.617 --> 02:00:10.559
Just like a parent, they care for us, or they should care for us.

02:00:13.117 --> 02:00:16.760
They shouldn't be treating students this way, connecting to her story.

02:00:18.962 --> 02:00:22.145
Parents should know what goes on in our education.

02:00:36.750 --> 02:00:39.851
and they should be treated as important allies in our education.

02:00:39.871 --> 02:00:50.676
That's why we need our schools to also be evaluated in how they invest in developing district staff and evidence based on professional development to better engage with parents and students in meaningful ways.

02:00:59.100 --> 02:01:05.883
We thank you for your commitment to parent engagement in school payment as a key indicator for the rubric and we

02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:09.581
Thank you very much.

02:01:22.589 --> 02:01:23.610
Buenos dias a todos.

02:01:24.430 --> 02:01:29.113
Mi nombre es Maria Rosa, leader de Pico, Conoco en Anaheim.

02:01:29.853 --> 02:01:32.615
Estamos aqui en apoyo de crear centros para los padres.

02:01:33.775 --> 02:01:39.719
en todas las escuelas de California que brinde la bienvenida a todos los padres sin preferencia alguna.

02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:56.090
Preparando a los padres para adquirir el conocimiento de saber y entender cómo el sistema educativo proporciona y debe de dar todos los servicios que aplican

02:01:57.014 --> 02:02:03.241
para que los padres, maestros y todo el personal de las escuelas seamos la voz de los estudiantes.

02:02:03.821 --> 02:02:19.018
Y unidos en el mismo camino, todos los estudiantes y en especial los English learners, student and poster student, logren las metas académicas y emocionales en un ambiente de armonía, por el bienestar de todos nuestros futuros profesionistas.

02:02:19.870 --> 02:02:23.595
We thank you for your commitment and parent engagement in school climate.

02:02:23.995 --> 02:02:37.372
As a key indicator for the rubrics, we ask to include parent engagement, manual evidence-based measure in the adoption of the LCFF rubrics so I can be used this school year.

02:02:37.972 --> 02:02:38.273
Thank you.

02:02:41.107 --> 02:02:50.149
Good morning to all, my name is Maria Rosa, leader of PICO California, C-O-L-L-O, in Anaheim, California.

02:02:50.689 --> 02:03:02.452
We're here to support the creation of parent centers in all the schools in California to provide a welcoming site for parents without distinction at all.

02:03:03.392 --> 02:03:09.754
To prepare the parents to acquire the knowledge and to understand the educational system.

02:03:12.338 --> 02:03:14.708
so that our children can have the benefit of this.

02:03:17.456 --> 02:03:43.503
I also would like the staff in the schools to give voice to the parents and United, because United, we are trying to seek the same path, to improve things for our students, especially for the English learner students, foster students, so that they can reach their academic and emotional goals in a harmonious environment.

02:03:43.983 --> 02:03:44.743
Thank you to all.

02:03:54.335 --> 02:03:59.637
Good morning, my name is Minister Keisha McGee and I am with Pico, California of San Bernardino.

02:04:00.458 --> 02:04:05.360
I am a mom of two college, one sixth grade, first grade and preschool student.

02:04:06.100 --> 02:04:18.966
I have shared my story with the board before about how my son was bullied in school and how that brought awareness and an awakening of the importance of parent engagement and getting rid of school suspension.

02:04:19.626 --> 02:04:24.410
and in return having positive reinforcement to ensure a better school climate.

02:04:25.331 --> 02:04:42.425
I would like to thank you for the work that you have done already to make sure these things are a success and I ask that you continue to make these key indicators for the rubrics and that you include parent engagement

02:04:43.026 --> 02:04:50.662
menus as evidence-based measures in the adoption of the LCFF rubrics so it can be used this school year.

02:04:50.862 --> 02:04:51.223
Thank you.

02:04:59.429 --> 02:04:59.930
Good morning.

02:05:00.590 --> 02:05:01.892
My name is Rick Alanis, Jr.

02:05:02.292 --> 02:05:09.099
I'm a youth and young adult pastor at Victor Art San Bernardino representing Pico, California, ICUC, and Gazzano into Now Generation.

02:05:09.960 --> 02:05:14.024
Today we want to thank you for including suspensions as part of the LCFF rubrics.

02:05:14.845 --> 02:05:22.313
We also want to ensure that we continue to keep students in class by replacing suspensions with positive behavior intervention support.

02:05:23.013 --> 02:05:26.796
We believe that this will play a key role in seeing a higher graduation percentage rate.

02:05:27.597 --> 02:05:32.400
We also believe that many students can benefit from a second chance mentoring and support program.

02:05:33.021 --> 02:05:46.391
It is through this type of program that many of the students that I work with, including myself, have been able to learn to deal with the emotional and psychological stress that many students deal with growing up in an environment filled with gangs, drugs, and violence.

02:05:46.952 --> 02:05:49.233
If not for a program like this, I would not be here today.

02:05:50.274 --> 02:05:53.777
It was through this type of second chance program that I was able to turn my life around.

02:05:54.498 --> 02:06:00.442
As someone who at one time was part of the problem, today I have become part of the solution because of these types of programs.

02:06:00.943 --> 02:06:07.128
And my hope and ask here today is that we will continue to look at these types of programs and seeing how we can integrate them into our schools.

02:06:07.388 --> 02:06:07.688
Thank you.

02:06:07.948 --> 02:06:08.409
God bless you.

02:06:10.123 --> 02:06:13.305
We'd like to ask the next group of speakers to please line up.

02:06:13.505 --> 02:06:35.178
Sheila Whitley, Jesse Aguilar, Lorraine Richards, Angela Ramos, Ken Burt, Estelle Lemieux, Martha Alvarez, Holly Edds, Alicia Assara, Annalee Medrano, Lisa Morns, Christy Sinclair, Jason Henderson, Jackie Wong, and Martha Zaragoza-Diaz.

02:06:35.899 --> 02:06:36.219
Thank you.

02:06:41.327 --> 02:06:44.888
Good morning, my name is Cecilia Gallegos with PICO California.

02:06:45.349 --> 02:06:53.433
As PICO California, we continue to organize at the local and state level to close academic achievement gaps.

02:06:53.833 --> 02:07:02.437
We continue to organize in support of positive school climate and culture at our schools and districts across California, uplifting the well-being of students,

02:07:02.697 --> 02:07:07.919
parents and caregivers through engaging in powerful shared decision-making and collective action.

02:07:08.439 --> 02:07:30.146
Between parents, caregivers, students, community members, and educators, we would like to urge our State Board of Education members to please adopt parent engagement rubrics that include a menu of evidence-based measures to use well-researched evidence-based data to be able to compare experiences across schools and districts that is needed to achieve continuous improvement.

02:07:30.646 --> 02:07:40.532
We ask to include parent engagements menu of evidence-based measures in the adoption of LCFF rubrics so it can be used in this school year.

02:07:40.632 --> 02:07:40.912
Thank you.

02:07:50.509 --> 02:07:52.270
Hello, my name is Katana Valenzuela.

02:07:52.510 --> 02:08:12.839
I'm with PICO California, and as PICO California, we believe that adopting a menu of evidence-based measures from which schools and districts can choose along with a self-assessment tool as evidence for the standard will provide flexibility to local schools and districts while maintaining high standards across the state with a focus on evidence-based practices.

02:08:13.479 --> 02:08:19.262
Comparable data to inform continuous improvement and accountability in schools and districts across the state.

02:08:20.795 --> 02:08:33.599
ability to correlate parent involvement to indicators in all eight priority areas and ensure that we are creating an integrated statewide system to support students to get success.

02:08:34.399 --> 02:08:36.120
We thank you for your commitment.

02:08:36.420 --> 02:08:46.723
We asked to include parent engagement menu of evidence based measures in the adoption of the LCFF rubrics so it can be used this school year.

02:09:08.098 --> 02:09:13.960
Good morning board members, Superintendent Torlakson, I'm Estella Mu and I'm with the California Teachers Association.

02:09:14.861 --> 02:09:26.725
In my limited time, I would like to bring to your attention the letter CTA and a broad coalition of teacher administrators, parents, students, and civil rights organizations submitted on this item.

02:09:27.325 --> 02:09:51.016
We came together to urge the board to maintain its strong commitment to establishing a single, coherent accountability and continuous improvement system that is multidimensional and focused on supporting equity of access, opportunity, and outcomes for all of California's diverse public school students, regardless of where they attend school.

02:09:51.716 --> 02:10:04.106
With continued appreciation for the engagement and evident hard work of your staff and the staff of the department, we respectfully ask that you consider our two requests.

02:10:04.666 --> 02:10:10.291
Our first is to support the staff position regarding the reporting of charter school performance.

02:10:11.131 --> 02:10:21.899
The long-awaited multiple measures dashboard for California schools should be equally available to students and parents in all public schools, including charter schools.

02:10:22.460 --> 02:10:29.245
As detailed in our letter, the language and intent of the LCFF strongly support staff's statement

02:10:29.625 --> 02:10:44.038
in this item that the reported argument by some charter school stakeholders is inconsistent with transparency and with the board's goal of developing a single coherent accountability system.

02:10:44.458 --> 02:10:53.386
We urge board members to stay the course and ensure charters are subject to holistic and multi-dimensional evaluations

02:10:53.846 --> 02:11:02.970
as well as to clarify that charter schools will be required to complete all applicable local indicators, including self-assessments.

02:11:03.550 --> 02:11:10.373
Two, support timely development of local indicators and possible state indicators.

02:11:10.893 --> 02:11:16.755
We are very concerned that the timelines for developing and finalizing local indicators for 2016-17

02:11:19.216 --> 02:11:26.538
and possible state indicators for 17-18 continue to be delayed as identified in our letter.

02:11:26.998 --> 02:11:41.341
These indicators ranging from parent engagement, school climate, to access to and enrollment in broad course of study are essential to ensure that rubrics are truly holistic and multi-dimensional.

02:11:41.841 --> 02:11:51.727
For many of us, our support for the rubrics has hinged in large part on the board's commitment to developing and incorporating them.

02:11:52.367 --> 02:12:02.773
Without the full development of these multiple measures, we do run the risk, once again, of relying on a system that is overly reliant and standardized test scores.

02:12:03.673 --> 02:12:25.775
As a partner in many of the indicator development efforts underway, we pledge our ongoing support and ask the board to explore how additional resources may be provided to assist the department and the state board staff who are working so tirelessly to make the promise of the rubrics a reality.

02:12:25.935 --> 02:12:26.276
Thank you.

02:12:33.775 --> 02:12:37.638
Good morning, Marta Alvarez on behalf of ACSA, the Association of California School Administrators.

02:12:38.059 --> 02:12:46.185
We're very grateful to the staff at the Department of Education and the State Board of Education for the extensive outreach over the last several weeks and months on the new system.

02:12:46.586 --> 02:12:54.052
We at ACSA have been able to partner with the Department of Education staff and State Board staff on several webinars, three over the past month and a half.

02:12:54.492 --> 02:12:57.675
on both the local performance indicators and some of the state indicators.

02:12:57.995 --> 02:13:08.504
So we've been able to try to provide information to the field on the new system, and we look forward to continuing to be partners in this work since it continues to be evolving and will be changing over time.

02:13:08.524 --> 02:13:19.993
We would like to encourage the State Board and the staff to do a memo to the field where it can clarify the different state indicators that have been adopted so far, as well as the local performance indicators.

02:13:20.613 --> 02:13:27.254
The memos have been wonderful with the information provided, but typically you have to go back several months to understand each of the action items.

02:13:27.554 --> 02:13:34.916
So if there is one comprehensive memo where there could be outline of what the state indicator is, the cut points and so forth, it would be really helpful to the public.

02:13:35.296 --> 02:13:38.697
And that way we can provide that to the field as an official document from you all.

02:13:39.057 --> 02:13:44.758
I will have my next colleague, Holly Edge, who acts as Vice President, to provide additional information.

02:13:44.918 --> 02:13:45.218
Thank you.

02:13:49.491 --> 02:13:49.951
Good morning.

02:13:50.912 --> 02:13:52.352
As Martha mentioned, my name is Holly Eads.

02:13:52.412 --> 02:13:58.515
I'm Assistant Superintendent for Educational Services in the Orchid Union School District, and I'm also Access State Vice President.

02:13:58.635 --> 02:14:00.736
So it gives me great pleasure to come and talk with you this morning.

02:14:01.197 --> 02:14:02.597
First, I want to commend the State Board.

02:14:02.837 --> 02:14:07.880
You have done an incredible job with all of the moving parts of this process.

02:14:08.520 --> 02:14:14.724
I truly feel like you've included us in the process, and I can't tell you how much that means, having done this job for quite a number of years.

02:14:15.104 --> 02:14:25.010
The ability to provide input, the dialogue and the conversations that are happening back and forth between departments and AXA, they're pushing information out to us.

02:14:25.810 --> 02:14:28.453
We really have felt like we've had a voice, and I want to thank you all.

02:14:28.473 --> 02:14:30.134
So this isn't the first time I've come to speak with you.

02:14:30.154 --> 02:14:34.939
I feel like we've been listened to, which is fantastic and very much appreciated.

02:14:34.959 --> 02:14:36.800
So thank you very much for that.

02:14:36.820 --> 02:14:40.744
I think our collective goal is to achieve a sense of balance and purpose with accountability.

02:14:41.304 --> 02:14:42.245
and make sure we do it right.

02:14:42.345 --> 02:14:51.955
So I appreciate the fact that you've tabled some of the decisions that were to be made today to make sure that we get it as close to perfect as we can, realizing it's not going to be there.

02:14:51.975 --> 02:14:56.941
And it's a work in progress, but taking the additional time for that is very much appreciated.

02:14:57.981 --> 02:15:02.603
On the issue of the self-assessment tools, I'd like to make a couple of suggestions with regards to those.

02:15:04.144 --> 02:15:10.187
I do feel that we support the use of local performance indicators.

02:15:10.587 --> 02:15:18.190
It's a very valuable tool that we can use to really holistically assess student progress and to take a look at it.

02:15:18.550 --> 02:15:20.991
I do ask that you take a look at the current proposals.

02:15:21.051 --> 02:15:22.032
They are rather lengthy.

02:15:22.812 --> 02:15:28.335
to expect us to have conversations with our stakeholders, with them having so much depth to them.

02:15:28.375 --> 02:15:29.255
It's difficult to do.

02:15:29.695 --> 02:15:39.580
We pull our stakeholders in for meetings and have discussions about those questions and walk through them together as a group, and with the length and depth of those assessments, that would be very cumbersome and hard for us to do.

02:15:39.940 --> 02:15:42.981
Also, some of the questions really need to have some rubrics with them to guide.

02:15:43.001 --> 02:15:47.083
They were difficult to answer as we worked through the process the first time as well.

02:15:48.243 --> 02:15:56.388
I actually am over here, I'm at the CCEE meeting today, meeting some additional briefing and information on the process and where we are, and I want to again thank you for that.

02:15:56.809 --> 02:16:00.431
The information that's been pushed out has been tremendous, so thank you very much.

02:16:04.893 --> 02:16:13.579
I'd like to call our next group of speakers, Sandy Mendoza, John Affelt, Liz Guillen, Tia Nguyen, Michelle Paracet,

02:16:14.790 --> 02:16:21.474
Sergio Luna, Terry Burns, Sarah Lillis, Eric Premack, Brian Lee, and Elizabeth Robitaille.

02:16:23.876 --> 02:16:25.477
Good morning, board members.

02:16:25.517 --> 02:16:31.981
My name is Martha Zaragoza-Diaz, and I am representing the California Association for Bilingual Education and Californians Together.

02:16:32.101 --> 02:16:39.306
First, I'd like to say that we support not adopting the standards for the academic indicators until January.

02:16:39.346 --> 02:16:41.608
We believe that there are some issues that still require

02:16:42.248 --> 02:16:47.211
a more thorough vetting such as including the RFIP data with the EL data.

02:16:47.391 --> 02:16:54.035
We believe that in doing so the true academic performance of both groups is not clearly shown.

02:16:54.535 --> 02:17:01.199
We recommend that the RFIP data with the EL data not be included for this year and have the EL work group

02:17:01.899 --> 02:17:04.580
provide a recommendation at the board January meeting.

02:17:04.780 --> 02:17:26.486
Also, during this time, CDE should analyze, share, and discuss with stakeholders the impacts of including RFEPs in the EL subgroup and the pluses and minuses of considering different post-redesignation time periods, such as one year, two year, or three years after reclassification as compared to the current decision to count four-year RFEPs as ELs.

02:17:28.444 --> 02:17:32.926
We believe that other thought through options could emerge through such a process.

02:17:33.387 --> 02:17:33.707
Thank you.

02:17:39.009 --> 02:17:42.171
Good morning, President Carson, Superintendent Torlakson, and esteemed members of the board.

02:17:42.231 --> 02:17:43.191
My name is Jackie Wong.

02:17:43.211 --> 02:17:44.612
I'm with the National Center for Youth Law.

02:17:45.032 --> 02:17:52.296
We actually spearhead initiative to close the achievement gap for students in foster care, and I know, again, a lot of you have been supportive of our efforts over time.

02:17:52.656 --> 02:17:56.418
I'm actually here to represent a broad base of foster youth education advocates.

02:17:56.878 --> 02:18:02.181
the Children Now Public Council, the Alliance for Children's Rights, and the California Alliance for Children and Families.

02:18:02.801 --> 02:18:19.329
We actually very much appreciate the efforts to engage our stakeholders in this conversation, but we actually remain very deeply concerned that the self-assessments for the County Office of Education only require that they mark that they did an assessment versus actually share publicly what those assessments entailed.

02:18:19.349 --> 02:18:24.111
So to that end, we actually encourage staff, CDE, as well as State Board of Education,

02:18:24.971 --> 02:18:30.955
to actually meaningfully engage us in the conversation about fully integrating Priority 10 into the existing rubrics.

02:18:32.096 --> 02:18:43.164
So we also suggest that we also do not duplicate reporting with the Foster Services Coordinating Program, and as much, if we can align kind of the reporting requirements under the grant as well as the rubric would be really great.

02:18:43.184 --> 02:18:46.326
Thank you again for your time and for prioritizing students in foster care.

02:18:50.566 --> 02:18:51.027
Good morning.

02:18:51.087 --> 02:18:52.208
My name is Sandy Mendoza.

02:18:52.228 --> 02:19:00.856
I'm with Families in Schools, and we appreciate the opportunity for continued thoughtful conversation around parent engagement in the next couple of months.

02:19:01.797 --> 02:19:14.609
But we want to assure you that we support the recommendations offered by CPAC, and in particular, what Board Member Ortiz-Ligon just raised, that while flexibility is important, it is important also to have

02:19:15.610 --> 02:19:26.395
guidance that directs LEAs in such a way that we don't have or support a culture of complacency, because that's what I'm afraid we'll end up with.

02:19:27.136 --> 02:19:40.442
And also, last Friday, there was a webinar hosted by WestEd, which raised a question at the end, asking if it would be a good idea to create a workgroup on parent engagement, and we would like to

02:19:41.182 --> 02:19:47.744
support that because I think it's important that we have experts at the table, especially parent leaders in that conversation.

02:19:48.304 --> 02:19:59.627
And finally, we also urge the board to consider expanding the requirement that LEI must report the results of local measurements outside of the board meeting, but also in the other important committees.

02:19:59.727 --> 02:20:00.027
Thank you.

02:20:06.235 --> 02:20:10.739
Good morning, John Eppfeld from Public Advocates and the LCFF Equity Coalition.

02:20:12.621 --> 02:20:18.126
Number one, we support the move on the scale score issue and getting that right in January.

02:20:18.326 --> 02:20:18.747
Number two,

02:20:20.846 --> 02:20:37.080
We agree with the Caltog recommendation that you defer adopting today the EL proficiency issue, and whether or not that indicator should include two years, three years, four years of RFEPs.

02:20:37.881 --> 02:20:45.187
It's really a more complicated issue, and I think like with the scale score and some of these local indicators, you should push that over to January and look at the data.

02:20:46.574 --> 02:20:58.363
Number three, we agree with the notion, Public Advocates does, of making sure we have a timely broad course access, standards implementation.

02:20:58.403 --> 02:21:06.829
We're getting a little worried about some of these other indicators slipping from even being into the 17-18 rubric.

02:21:06.849 --> 02:21:13.994
I mean, we need recommendations in March for adoption in September, and we hope that you'll stay on that timeline.

02:21:14.014 --> 02:21:14.274
Thank you.

02:21:17.950 --> 02:21:20.973
Morning, Terry Burns, behalf of California School Boards Association.

02:21:21.654 --> 02:21:29.922
I first want to say that we support the clarifications on the charter school and the applicability of the rules to charter schools so that that's clear to everyone.

02:21:31.201 --> 02:21:33.163
One of the comments deal with communications.

02:21:33.183 --> 02:21:38.027
I want to thank members some for raising the issue of the implications of the delay.

02:21:38.387 --> 02:21:41.630
We've been telling folks are going to get their data in February.

02:21:42.150 --> 02:21:49.697
We need to be as clear as possible about when they'll get it, what to expect and how they can start planning to address their rubrics with that.

02:21:50.437 --> 02:21:57.979
Additionally, we still have the concern about including 11th grade assessment data, not including it in the assessment item.

02:21:58.019 --> 02:22:07.862
We think it's gonna be very difficult to explain to parents and reporters and the community as a whole why there is nothing in the assessments item for high school districts.

02:22:09.283 --> 02:22:09.743
Finally,

02:22:11.003 --> 02:22:20.332
We have concerns about clarifying to which years the data applies because your data is different in different indicators.

02:22:20.452 --> 02:22:23.195
And so please be clear on what folks are getting.

02:22:23.275 --> 02:22:23.575
Thank you.

02:22:29.730 --> 02:22:30.470
I should have put that on.

02:22:31.010 --> 02:22:35.931
Hi, Brian Lee on behalf of Fight Crime Invest in Kids, Mission Readiness, and Ready Nation.

02:22:35.951 --> 02:22:48.614
I wanted to make one point, and that is that we strongly believe that the local performance indicator on school climate should require reporting climate survey results annually, not every other year as currently proposed.

02:22:49.154 --> 02:22:49.874
This is very important.

02:22:49.894 --> 02:22:52.174
We had a letter submitted by 12 different organizations.

02:22:52.414 --> 02:22:55.695
We've appreciated the commitment to school climate survey that we've heard from the board.

02:22:56.796 --> 02:22:59.177
But the local performance indicator does not match that commitment.

02:22:59.277 --> 02:23:00.438
Basically, it sends a message.

02:23:00.498 --> 02:23:04.942
This is the one indicator singled out that you don't need annual data just every other year.

02:23:05.442 --> 02:23:08.224
That basically says it's not nearly as important as other things.

02:23:08.865 --> 02:23:14.469
Also, it's inconsistent with the annual requirement of LCFF, which is about annual reporting on how are you meeting goals.

02:23:15.289 --> 02:23:18.011
And in practice, what happens if you did your survey,

02:23:19.012 --> 02:23:25.376
The year before the LCAP, it means you only see results once in the three-year LCAP, which really does not give us a chance to see what's happening.

02:23:25.776 --> 02:23:27.157
It's also just an outdated relic.

02:23:27.177 --> 02:23:36.322
20 years ago, when we first started having Healthy Kids Survey required due to federal law, we said every other year comes a new thing, but now it's no longer a new thing.

02:23:36.562 --> 02:23:36.862
Thank you.

02:23:40.287 --> 02:23:41.928
Good morning, Samantha Tran with Children Now.

02:23:42.428 --> 02:23:46.331
I also wanted to thank the board for delaying the action on the academic indicator.

02:23:46.351 --> 02:23:51.374
Moving to scale scores actually allows us to see the continuum of performance for kids, so it's the right direction.

02:23:52.695 --> 02:23:56.417
We're also appreciative around the work on growth and trying to create a growth model.

02:23:56.757 --> 02:24:05.963
A little concerned with the staff memo, though, about putting growth and cohort status, cohort data in the academic indicator together, because it's measured different things and conflates things.

02:24:06.363 --> 02:24:11.467
So as we have that conversation about the growth indicator, how we bring that into the system will be important.

02:24:12.088 --> 02:24:19.093
I want to echo Brian's point about the local surveys and also expanding that to parents and teachers that their point of view is very important and needs to be integrated.

02:24:19.614 --> 02:24:23.557
Then finally, I want to raise an issue that I hope the board will address at the next meeting,

02:24:23.917 --> 02:24:26.218
and this is around alternative education.

02:24:26.578 --> 02:24:50.687
The decision in September was to remove alternative education from the overarching accountability system, and we get that from a school perspective, we need to think about those indicators in a thoughtful way, but from a district perspective, it creates a really challenging context where we're actually making those kids invisible in the system, and it's a real issue for seniors because one out of every five seniors goes through an alternative ed system, and so they're not being captured at all right now.

02:24:50.967 --> 02:24:51.407
Thank you very much.

02:24:55.623 --> 02:24:56.063
Good morning.

02:24:56.143 --> 02:24:57.265
Sarah Lillis with Ed voice.

02:24:57.785 --> 02:25:12.379
I also want to reiterate Miss Burns comments both about our appreciation, the clarification on charter schools and their different statutory construct as it relates to the rubrics and renewals and also again reiterate our the need to have 11th grade assessments, both in the C C I and as a separate measure.

02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:17.684
And in anticipation of January's discussion, I did just want to talk about, um

02:25:19.105 --> 02:25:20.626
thinking about transparency.

02:25:20.666 --> 02:25:26.488
When we talk about transparency, what we really mean is about having an honest conversation both about where we are and where we want to go.

02:25:26.528 --> 02:25:32.010
And we were very concerned about the performance standards that we were going to be approving today.

02:25:32.370 --> 02:25:36.612
When we talk about masking low performance in the yellow

02:25:37.432 --> 02:25:43.917
group, but also setting that green target as something that we really want as a state that want to be our goal.

02:25:43.957 --> 02:25:47.660
If the green is our goal, then what is the message that we're sending?

02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:58.307
The proposal that we're not talking about today was 51% proficient in math, and we at EdVoice don't feel like that is actually the message that California wants to send, that that's good enough and that's our goal.

02:25:58.367 --> 02:26:00.289
So we look forward to that conversation in January.

02:26:05.003 --> 02:26:07.744
Good morning, Colin Miller with the California Charter Schools Association.

02:26:08.425 --> 02:26:13.287
I do want to thank you for your shifting the emphasis to scale scores.

02:26:13.327 --> 02:26:16.449
That's something we've been talking about for a long time and it's great to see that moving forward.

02:26:17.429 --> 02:26:25.853
Also want to thank the board staff and department staff for meeting with us and discussing some of the more detailed nuances about how this system applies to charter schools.

02:26:26.413 --> 02:26:29.475
We're very pleased with the recommendations that came forward in attachment three.

02:26:30.215 --> 02:26:35.737
and we believe they reflect an alignment with the law as the law has stated on those issues.

02:26:36.137 --> 02:26:56.303
A little confused at some of the comments today because we, as you know, charter schools have been working with an outcome-based accountability system for many, many years, so we are not afraid of that accountability, we just want to make sure that it's aligned to our goals and the outcomes that we're seeking to achieve for our students.

02:26:57.544 --> 02:27:22.203
So with that, I also want to just note that we are also a little bit confused about what the recommendation is today, mostly on the attachment three, or attachment two, because the recommendations are in the item, but they're not in the, they're in the attachment, but not in the item, so it would be great to get some clarity on your motion to your point, Member Burr.

02:27:22.364 --> 02:27:22.584
Thank you.

02:27:26.047 --> 02:27:27.709
Eric Premack, Charter Schools Development Center.

02:27:27.789 --> 02:27:30.952
We very much appreciate some of the clarity here on charter schools.

02:27:32.054 --> 02:27:39.161
We do remain concerned, though, that they seem to be subbing in criteria, alternate criteria relative to what's in the statute.

02:27:40.203 --> 02:27:45.749
We're also especially concerned about the language does not reflect the fact that we have

02:27:46.049 --> 02:27:47.290
We do have some serious technical concerns about.

02:27:47.310 --> 02:27:58.297
Separate charter renewal threshold language during the suspension of the API and the memo and the proposed language to you ignore that we've suggested an amendment to address that issue.

02:28:07.223 --> 02:28:23.591
whether SBAC can actually do that given the severely truncated adaptability of the test and the long gap in time between grades 8 and 11, whether you're going to get any valid growth information at the high school level we think is quite questionable.

02:28:24.031 --> 02:28:26.272
Finally, we're just very pleased to see that the

02:28:27.033 --> 02:28:37.450
coalition is so very concerned about charter school parents and equity now and we look forward to their support in the upcoming legislative session to get equal funding and facilities for charter schools too.

02:28:37.790 --> 02:28:38.271
So thank you.

02:28:41.127 --> 02:28:44.068
Okay, that's the end of the public comment.

02:28:44.849 --> 02:28:52.372
So now ready for more board discussion before we consider the motion if there is more board discussion.

02:28:53.093 --> 02:28:59.076
So, Cindy, would you clarify the motion now before the board since the issue about the attachment.

02:28:59.356 --> 02:29:00.957
Yeah, just just clarify.

02:29:01.037 --> 02:29:01.617
That'll be helpful.

02:29:01.837 --> 02:29:02.638
I can clarify.

02:29:03.158 --> 02:29:14.626
So the attachment specifically, attachment 2, page 3 of 8, has a subtitle that says recommendations, and the first sentence says that the CPAC provided input.

02:29:14.906 --> 02:29:16.987
So these are recommendations from CPAC.

02:29:17.307 --> 02:29:22.431
What you are taking action on is the actual recommendation that is included in the board item.

02:29:22.831 --> 02:29:24.172
which is on the screen here.

02:29:24.392 --> 02:29:31.917
This is number two, and then number three, which we reviewed, as well as is the action you are taking.

02:29:31.937 --> 02:29:37.822
Does that make sense?

02:29:39.263 --> 02:29:45.607
Member Burr, then Member Williams.

02:29:45.967 --> 02:29:48.129
You were showing number two a minute ago, I think.

02:29:48.149 --> 02:29:48.289
Yes.

02:29:50.498 --> 02:30:04.797
So the proposed self-assessment tools I get for the number Priority 9 and 10, and Dave talked about Priority 1, which is essentially what LEAs have had to report for a long time around the Williams condition.

02:30:05.758 --> 02:30:11.141
And school climate, then, on priority six, as I understand it, is a narrative.

02:30:11.281 --> 02:30:11.922
An open text box.

02:30:11.942 --> 02:30:14.963
Open text box, lots of flexibilities for LEAs.

02:30:15.183 --> 02:30:15.644
That's correct.

02:30:15.784 --> 02:30:17.505
And that's all we're being asked to approve.

02:30:17.625 --> 02:30:18.145
That's correct.

02:30:18.445 --> 02:30:18.725
Okay.

02:30:18.865 --> 02:30:23.968
This on top of the local governing board would bring these forward in a public meeting.

02:30:24.028 --> 02:30:26.229
So I actually have two questions.

02:30:26.609 --> 02:30:28.810
One is actually on the other priority areas.

02:30:28.850 --> 02:30:38.355
We heard a lot of concern about the timeline for the ones that we haven't yet completed, and I'm looking at the timeline attachment, and it's not clear to me when those are gonna come forward.

02:30:38.895 --> 02:30:41.277
So if you could clarify that, I would appreciate it.

02:30:41.737 --> 02:30:50.121
And then, Cindy, more to the other substantive conversation, that when we talk in January about growth models and scale scores,

02:30:50.701 --> 02:31:02.608
I think we really need to have a very clear discussion about whether or not grade 11 can be included in a growth model since we have no testing in grades nine and 10.

02:31:03.308 --> 02:31:12.353
We had this conversation before when we talked about the college and career indicator and said it's more appropriate to include it in college and career indicator model.

02:31:13.114 --> 02:31:18.437
But so I'm not sure people are, I don't understand, I'm not gonna attribute to other people

02:31:19.057 --> 02:31:21.259
whether or not it can be in a growth model.

02:31:21.279 --> 02:31:34.472
But I think we have to talk about it and also make crystal clear, everybody who's listening, the test scores are available to every LEA that tests 11th grade students and they are obviously available to parents.

02:31:35.032 --> 02:31:37.775
So nobody's hiding grade 11 test scores.

02:31:38.175 --> 02:31:47.383
The question is whether or not they can validly be included in a growth model, given the fact that we don't test in the earlier grades in high school.

02:31:47.984 --> 02:31:53.228
So I think we just want to be real clear about that, and also back to the communication thing.

02:31:54.469 --> 02:31:58.933
Make sure that we're clear to LEAs what they're getting, what they can do with the information.

02:31:59.674 --> 02:32:02.957
But my specific question is about the timeline for the other priority areas.

02:32:04.753 --> 02:32:05.614
Board Member Williams.

02:32:05.714 --> 02:32:07.815
We're looking at January of 2017.

02:32:08.976 --> 02:32:23.265
I just wanted to follow up on what Member Burr said earlier about her concern that at least on this slide attachment to is down there in parentheses which you were concerned about because it sounded like it was

02:32:24.626 --> 02:32:32.416
So I'm assuming that the recommendation we can scratch out attachment to, and that is not part of the recommendation.

02:32:32.436 --> 02:32:33.016
Please do.

02:32:33.056 --> 02:32:38.383
That was, again, my edit to provide you some guidance on where to find the details behind it.

02:32:38.423 --> 02:32:39.104
So I apologize.

02:32:39.144 --> 02:32:43.629
This has been a confusion in presenting the motion.

02:32:43.969 --> 02:32:50.677
And just to clarify, the item, the recommendation is found in the item, which does not include the parentheses attachment to reference.

02:32:50.697 --> 02:32:54.942
So just clarify what the motion will be if someone moves the staff recommendation.

02:32:54.982 --> 02:32:56.183
It's from the item itself.

02:32:56.243 --> 02:32:57.585
It's on the top of page two.

02:32:57.745 --> 02:32:58.506
To withdraw one.

02:32:58.526 --> 02:33:00.809
Okay, Board Member Rocker.

02:33:03.081 --> 02:33:14.163
I also, in listening to the public comment, there seemed to be a lot of ideas or some mental models about how the growth model itself is going to operate.

02:33:14.183 --> 02:33:28.306
And so I think it's very, I go back to what Carrick Ashley said at the September board meeting, and that has remained the one question that stays in my mind on the conversation about the growth model.

02:33:29.186 --> 02:33:33.530
you have to decide what it is you're asking the growth model to do.

02:33:34.350 --> 02:33:43.777
And so there are different types of growth models and there are different types of data that can be included in those growth models.

02:33:43.837 --> 02:33:57.367
And what is happening today in taking a lot of the conversation about the scaled scores and the attention to proficiency, percent proficiency off the table with this item is to give

02:33:58.187 --> 02:34:09.241
our staff and the technical design team, the opportunity to answer the question that Carrick Ashley put in front of the board in September.

02:34:09.742 --> 02:34:12.705
There has been no decision about what the model is.

02:34:13.206 --> 02:34:17.251
There has been no determination about how the model will operate.

02:34:17.891 --> 02:34:27.518
The goal is to figure out the best type of model that will give us the types of data we believe we're asking for.

02:34:27.999 --> 02:34:35.624
And so I think that the mental model many people have are about some assumptions about what the growth model will tell us.

02:34:36.625 --> 02:34:43.594
is a divergence from what we're actually tasking the staff to do right now.

02:34:43.654 --> 02:34:52.185
So I think we are getting ahead of putting the cart before the horse and having the conversation about the assessments and about what is included and what is not included.

02:34:52.306 --> 02:34:52.986
Because again,

02:34:53.627 --> 02:34:56.950
The question is, what are we asking the growth model to do?

02:34:57.290 --> 02:34:59.271
That's not a conversation we have had.

02:34:59.652 --> 02:35:01.053
We know we want a growth model.

02:35:01.073 --> 02:35:06.177
We have a statutory requirement to develop a growth model, and that is clearly in front of us.

02:35:06.617 --> 02:35:19.006
But again, I want to remind you, the staff has already asked the board, what are you asking of the growth model, and what is it we believe, what kind of evidence or information do we believe a growth model is going to give us?

02:35:19.046 --> 02:35:22.209
That is not a conversation we have had as yet.

02:35:23.370 --> 02:35:24.630
Board Member Ortiz-Lacombe.

02:35:27.011 --> 02:35:27.351
Thank you.

02:35:27.911 --> 02:35:32.292
Again, Carrick Ashley, Deputy Superintendent.

02:35:33.792 --> 02:35:35.633
So thank you, Member Rucker.

02:35:36.233 --> 02:35:43.055
So let me just clarify a couple of things, just to get it off the table, I guess.

02:35:44.335 --> 02:35:51.457
Smarter balance scores between eighth grade and 11th grade can be used in a growth model.

02:35:51.937 --> 02:35:52.437
They can.

02:35:53.938 --> 02:35:59.141
We need to have the discussion about whether we think that's appropriate to do or not, but they can be.

02:36:00.602 --> 02:36:15.651
And whether you want to, we can start the discussion, whether you as a board would feel comfortable making a decision about doing that without actually seeing the data between grade 8 and grade 11.

02:36:18.436 --> 02:36:20.977
is a question for you to ask yourselves.

02:36:22.958 --> 02:36:32.042
I can say that we can start the conversation in January, but let's separate out the two.

02:36:33.203 --> 02:36:40.727
Jenny Singh and her staff have plenty of work to do just to talk about scale scores, and so that's one discussion.

02:36:40.967 --> 02:36:46.950
But we can start the discussion in January, too, about what is it that we want out of a growth model in the future.

02:36:49.517 --> 02:36:49.777
Go ahead.

02:36:52.018 --> 02:37:00.081
I know we haven't had a conversation, but we did have an initial conversation about what do we want to see from this growth model.

02:37:00.361 --> 02:37:06.023
And I was very excited when President Kurz mentioned we want to see how we can narrow achievement gaps.

02:37:06.343 --> 02:37:16.447
And that was a conversation that began in September, how the growth model could be a way for us to really, if we're committed to that, to see how we can narrow achievement gaps.

02:37:16.747 --> 02:37:22.808
So I would like to see that conversation resume in January as part of the larger dialogue about this model.

02:37:23.468 --> 02:37:27.209
A couple of other questions going back to Board Member Burr.

02:37:27.689 --> 02:37:31.590
The timeline for some of these indicators, we know we've had some delays.

02:37:31.730 --> 02:37:40.372
I know that we have work groups, and because we want to be as thorough as possible and have a lot of input from different stakeholders, that causes the delays.

02:37:40.752 --> 02:37:44.234
So in an effort to be accommodating, we're also causing delays.

02:37:44.735 --> 02:37:48.457
But we want to be fair to our schools and our LEAs rather.

02:37:48.817 --> 02:38:06.028
So I think that the memo that shows what state indicators we adopted, what local indicators we adopted, if we could also see a timeline to see if we're giving LEAs sufficient time to complete their LCAP templates with indicators that we have adopted and we're requiring.

02:38:06.488 --> 02:38:11.511
parent engagement, some of the other indicators that folks here in the public have addressed.

02:38:11.852 --> 02:38:17.195
If we could also incorporate that information, because I'm personally losing sight of all the timelines as well.

02:38:17.215 --> 02:38:18.896
They're all overlapping, thanks.

02:38:18.916 --> 02:38:21.278
Board member.

02:38:22.813 --> 02:38:24.875
Go ahead.

02:38:25.135 --> 02:38:25.475
Thank you.

02:38:26.135 --> 02:38:41.046
First of all, I'd like to thank the members of CORE that came today to speak to us, and in particular for your energy and efforts in sharing all the good work that you've already done with the CDE staff and with us.

02:38:41.427 --> 02:38:45.490
I think there's a lot of learning we can gain from what you've already been through.

02:38:45.510 --> 02:38:46.170
That's terrific.

02:38:46.490 --> 02:38:47.791
I have one clarification about

02:38:48.932 --> 02:38:52.074
the recommendation as regards to foster youth.

02:38:52.475 --> 02:39:03.002
We heard from a speaker today who indicated that this was merely a checkbox reporting regarding foster youth, and I did not read it that way.

02:39:03.262 --> 02:39:16.191
I read it that the self-assessment would be shared, that it would be made public, that in terms of the foster, I forget the number, is it 10?

02:39:17.232 --> 02:39:17.592
Priority 10.

02:39:19.867 --> 02:39:22.709
The intent is for... Priority 10.

02:39:23.409 --> 02:39:23.729
I'm sorry?

02:39:24.270 --> 02:39:39.719
It's priority 10, and then this is the piece that I think brings it to the surface of requiring it to be in a public forum, the discussion about the evidence that they are using to show that they've, how they've assessed their performance in that particular area.

02:39:40.159 --> 02:39:43.181
Not just a checkbox, but how they made this assessment.

02:39:43.861 --> 02:39:45.844
That's the intent.

02:39:45.904 --> 02:39:48.948
That's the intent and that I would agree with, of course.

02:39:49.869 --> 02:40:01.023
I do think that Mr. President Kerr's comment about not providing soon enough, perhaps, as many

02:40:02.229 --> 02:40:14.217
good examples of ways that schools and districts can better assess parent engagement, student voice, climate, school climate.

02:40:16.761 --> 02:40:19.083
Yeah, is a concern, is a problem at this point.

02:40:19.963 --> 02:40:27.829
We heard from speakers today who feel as though they're still not being listened to in their schools, parents who feel that they're still not being heard.

02:40:27.849 --> 02:40:39.217
I remember Ortiz-Lacombe talked about the potential of some districts or schools having a laissez-faire attitude about school climate assessment.

02:40:40.225 --> 02:40:57.734
I think it's really helpful if this work group that Deputy Superintendent Price mentioned can move as quickly as possible to disseminate as many good examples, not just the Healthy Kids Survey, even if

02:40:59.075 --> 02:41:02.297
Some of the examples are not perfect, and we know they won't be.

02:41:03.238 --> 02:41:07.581
I think the laissez-faire attitude comes when they don't know what to do.

02:41:07.641 --> 02:41:10.343
They don't have something that is recommended.

02:41:11.503 --> 02:41:12.744
I agree with the flexibility.

02:41:12.784 --> 02:41:13.585
I agree with not

02:41:14.965 --> 02:41:17.906
demanding one methodology here.

02:41:18.746 --> 02:41:20.527
So we need to give them plenty of options.

02:41:21.207 --> 02:41:25.088
Because I know if I were running a school right now, I too would be scratching my head.

02:41:25.108 --> 02:41:26.629
Now, what's the best way of doing this?

02:41:26.649 --> 02:41:28.789
How could I possibly do this well?

02:41:29.870 --> 02:41:30.350
So let's help.

02:41:31.450 --> 02:41:31.650
Thanks.

02:41:36.813 --> 02:41:44.602
I just want to echo the sentiments of a lot of the speakers who also talked about parent engagement like other members of the board have stated.

02:41:44.622 --> 02:41:55.215
I am strongly in favor of this incorporation to be definitely part of this accountability system just because speaking as a student, parent engagement is something that is

02:41:55.615 --> 02:42:14.088
very, very crucial to a lot of different schools and the fact that some schools have a huge amount of parent engagement and some just don't is unfair for the students and I think a way to quantify that information would be very important and able to help us make future decisions on this board too.

02:42:17.034 --> 02:42:23.280
Okay, I guess that concludes board comment and we're ready, no?

02:42:23.981 --> 02:42:26.123
I move approval of CD's recommendation.

02:42:29.086 --> 02:42:30.167
Want to clarify one more time?

02:42:30.996 --> 02:42:36.197
Well, I just want to make sure, because again, the slide says something different than what people see on the screen.

02:42:37.358 --> 02:42:45.000
It's the recommendation that's in our item on page two, and it would be, help me with this, items two, three, and four.

02:42:45.140 --> 02:42:47.101
Item one was withdrawn.

02:42:47.141 --> 02:42:49.101
That had to do with the academic indicator.

02:42:49.421 --> 02:42:50.001
That's correct.

02:42:51.742 --> 02:42:52.102
Okay.

02:42:52.602 --> 02:42:55.683
All those in favor of the motion, raise your hands.

02:42:55.883 --> 02:42:56.223
Second.

02:42:56.323 --> 02:42:57.163
Is there a second?

02:42:57.203 --> 02:42:57.544
Second.

02:43:00.783 --> 02:43:01.604
All right, raise your hand.

02:43:03.125 --> 02:43:04.926
Thank you, that's unanimously approved.

02:43:05.767 --> 02:43:27.062
I just wanted to say in closing, today's actions by the board ensures that the academics performance data included when California's new accountability system launches early next year, provides a complete picture of how all students in a school or district perform on the state English and mathematics assessments.

02:43:27.922 --> 02:43:38.408
It is important to get this system right from the beginning so parents, educators and the public will have the information they need to see how their schools and districts are doing.

02:43:39.289 --> 02:43:50.916
Rather than approving the short-term use of an outmoded approach, the board's action reflects its commitment to leveraging the strengths of our new assessment within our accountability system.

02:43:51.717 --> 02:43:53.518
So thank the board for that and

02:43:54.753 --> 02:44:02.736
I think we can start on item four for a while, and so why don't we have the presentation on that?

02:44:07.638 --> 02:44:11.160
Good morning, President Kerr, Superintendent Torlakson, members of the board.

02:44:11.220 --> 02:44:14.541
I'm Jeff Breshears, the director of the local agency system support office.

02:44:26.266 --> 02:44:31.870
Item four, the adoption of the proposed revised local control and accountability plan is an action information item.

02:44:32.730 --> 02:44:49.541
The CDE recommends that the SPE adopt the proposed revised LCAP and annual update template, which is attachment one, and allow the CDE in collaboration with the SPE staff to make any necessary typographical or formatting corrections as the document is prepared for posting on the CDE website.

02:44:50.542 --> 02:44:52.103
As part of the adoption process,

02:44:53.664 --> 02:45:11.279
CDE staff and SBE staff will work in conjunction with the Office of Administrative Law to complete the requisite procedures to repeal California Code of Regulations, Title V, Section 15497.5, Local Control and Accountability Plan and Annual Update Template, which is our current LCAP template.

02:45:12.864 --> 02:45:36.703
The proposed revised LCAP and annual update template reflects the collaborative efforts of SBE staff, our office, CDE's LCAP support team, CESA, WestEd, and it incorporates suggested revisions from numerous stakeholders, education coalition, and advocacy groups, and builds on input received from the SBE at previous meetings and via CDE's LCAP redesign survey.

02:45:37.523 --> 02:45:41.947
Revisions to the LCAP template include both changes to the content and format of the change.

02:45:43.587 --> 02:45:44.087
of the plan.

02:45:45.949 --> 02:45:51.532
The proposed LCAP is consistent with the design principles approved by the SBE at its May meeting, shown here.

02:45:56.235 --> 02:46:02.439
The LCAP sections have been reordered, as well as moved the instructions and guiding questions to an addendum.

02:46:06.994 --> 02:46:13.863
The new design promotes ease of reading with more white space and the addition of color, helping to improve the user experience.

02:46:14.124 --> 02:46:21.474
And also for clarity, revisions were made to prompts, headings, and instructions, with headings hyperlinked to the applicable instructions.

02:46:24.082 --> 02:46:35.574
A plan summary has been added and has been revised from both the drafts presented at the July meeting and also from the revised draft LCAP template provided in the September information memorandum.

02:46:36.415 --> 02:46:46.506
The planned actions and services table within the goals, actions, and service section has been modified, and the section three, use of supplemental and concentration grant funds and proportionality,

02:46:47.126 --> 02:46:55.111
has been changed both in name, demonstration of increased or improved services for unduplicated pupils, and in the prompts and in the instructions.

02:46:55.731 --> 02:47:03.275
These next few slides just show the progression of changes to the plan summary from July to September to the proposed revisions now.

02:47:04.516 --> 02:47:06.057
In July it was just one prompt.

02:47:06.777 --> 02:47:10.880
In September it moved to more prescriptive prompts.

02:47:14.830 --> 02:47:29.575
to the proposed draft now, which includes the ability for LEAs to tell their story, to highlight any aspects of their LCAP, and then review performance, looking at their greatest needs, their greatest performance and performance gaps.

02:47:34.352 --> 02:47:55.610
Responsive to the direction given by the SBE at its July meeting, the LCAP template specifically ties to the evaluation rubrics with prompts in the plan summary, as part of the analysis portion in the annual update section, and within the instructions as school districts, charter schools, and county offices of education articulate identified needs to develop specific goals.

02:47:57.802 --> 02:48:16.773
Also, in response to concerns raised in the July State Board meeting, our office met with Member Sun, SBE's charter staff, and representatives from the California Charter Schools Association, Charter Schools Development Center, and as a result of this meeting, instructions have been clarified in these areas specific to charter schools.

02:48:19.568 --> 02:48:30.402
Within the goals, action, and services sections, LEAs will identify those planned actions and services that will or will not contribute to meeting the increase or improved services requirement.

02:48:31.184 --> 02:48:33.927
This identification will facilitate the responses

02:48:35.128 --> 02:48:52.379
in the demonstration of increased or improved services for unduplicated pupils in that section and allow reference back to the actions and services rather than having to cut and paste or list those actions and services to meeting the increased or improved services requirement as part of the response in the section.

02:48:56.857 --> 02:49:08.086
Besides formatting, the expected annual measurable outcomes and actual outcomes, as well as the planned actions and services and actual actions and services have been placed side by side for ease of comparison.

02:49:09.247 --> 02:49:24.999
In the analysis section of the annual update, prompts have been changed to allow LEAs to reflect on the overall implementation and effectiveness of the actions and services to achieve the articulated goal, and it also refers to the evaluation rubrics as part of the analysis process.

02:49:26.229 --> 02:49:34.474
In the stakeholder engagement section, this was changed from four narrative responses to two, and a change from vertical to horizontal orientation.

02:49:36.915 --> 02:49:53.566
The expected annual measurable outcome table has been reformatted to specifically identify the metrics associated with the goal to identify the baselines from which expected outcomes will be set, and they've been arranged in columns for ease of reading and comparison of the expected growth throughout the three years of the LCAP.

02:49:54.446 --> 02:50:06.055
Checkboxes have been added to identify goals and or planned actions and services as new, modified, or unchanged from the previous year, again, as part of the annual update and analysis process.

02:50:06.495 --> 02:50:18.724
This will facilitate transparency and accessibility for stakeholders by clearly identifying any changes made to these goals or planned actions and services, particularly during the second and third years of the three-year LCAP.

02:50:21.007 --> 02:50:37.419
For actions and services that are not identified by the LEAs contributing to meeting the requirement to increase or improve services for unduplicated students, the LEAs will indicate which student group will benefit from the actions and services and the locations and or grade spans of those actions and services.

02:50:38.219 --> 02:50:42.783
Students with disabilities has been added to align with the federal state systemic improvement plan.

02:50:44.878 --> 02:51:08.375
For any action the service identified by the LEA is contributing to meeting the requirement to increase or improve services for unduplicated students, the LEA will identify the unduplicated student group or groups being served and will identify the scope of service by indicating either LEA-wide, school-wide, or limited to those unduplicated student groups already identified, and they'll identify the location and or grade spans of those service.

02:51:10.540 --> 02:51:16.248
The last section of the LCAP template is demonstration of increase for improved services for unduplicated students.

02:51:16.729 --> 02:51:25.161
The section has been revised to allow LEAs to describe how services provided for unduplicated students are increased or improved by the percentage required.

02:51:25.996 --> 02:51:39.645
And if the overall increase for improved services include any actions or services being funded and provided on a school-wide or district-wide basis, the LEA will identify each action and service and include the required descriptions supporting that action or service.

02:51:40.545 --> 02:51:50.472
Again, I'd like to thank all the stakeholders that have been involved in taking the time to give us input regarding the revised template and for participating in the process.

02:51:50.912 --> 02:51:54.755
We certainly have endeavored to make this project a collaborative process.

02:51:55.535 --> 02:52:01.400
And while this isn't a perfect template, we believe it's a marked improvement, and we'd be glad to answer any questions that you have.

02:52:03.282 --> 02:52:05.744
Okay, thank you for the presentation.

02:52:08.226 --> 02:52:09.207
Board member questions.

02:52:09.567 --> 02:52:15.472
I think we've been improving this over time, and it's an example of the continuous improvement idea.

02:52:16.813 --> 02:52:20.916
We've heard a lot, and this is definitely a step forward.

02:52:21.577 --> 02:52:21.797
Right.

02:52:22.458 --> 02:52:23.579
Board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

02:52:27.300 --> 02:52:27.620
Thank you.

02:52:28.020 --> 02:52:41.384
I wasn't part of the original process for designing the first couple of LCAP templates, but I have heard a lot of complaints, so I think that this is addressing some of the complaints that we've heard from our school leaders.

02:52:42.284 --> 02:52:52.707
I think that this is a huge improvement, though, from what I've seen, and I appreciate all the work that has gone to redesigning the LCAP template, and that effort to really align it with the evaluation rubrics.

02:52:53.207 --> 02:52:57.450
I do have a couple of questions regarding the plan summary.

02:52:58.651 --> 02:53:09.838
And again, I appreciate the intent behind the greatest progress and making sure that we highlight some of the best practices and outcomes of our LEAs and the greatest needs.

02:53:10.758 --> 02:53:12.379
as well as the performance gaps.

02:53:12.400 --> 02:53:16.263
But I have some concerns and some recommendations.

02:53:16.623 --> 02:53:26.311
For the greatest needs, it mentions the red and the orange category, which we know is aligning it to the evaluation rubric, which we know is aligning it to the equity report.

02:53:28.132 --> 02:53:44.275
I would like us to spell out the word overall performance was identified in the equity report, parentheses, red and orange performance category, so that we have consistency of terminology, and it really shows an intent to align both of these tools.

02:53:45.176 --> 02:53:56.858
We're essentially saying it by identifying the red and the orange categories, but what we have that under is equity report, so why not use the terminology that we're using for evaluation rubrics.

02:53:57.578 --> 02:54:07.221
Under the performance, I think, again, I had a concern, and I think that this addresses the concern of what happens to those students in the yellow.

02:54:08.001 --> 02:54:23.426
They're not really mentioned in the equity report, and we want to make sure that we're able to also move them towards the state target, which is right now the green, and I think we need to be very explicit when we say what is the target that we're aiming towards, and it's that green performance band.

02:54:24.046 --> 02:54:35.751
But for this performance band, I think that intra-district gaps, we need to be aware of those, but we're also assuming that that particular district has students in each of those bands.

02:54:36.251 --> 02:54:41.753
So if you have students in the blue band, in the green band, looking to performance levels below,

02:54:42.533 --> 02:54:48.756
is a good practice because we want to move them to the state benchmark, not the district.

02:54:49.137 --> 02:54:56.160
If we have a district that has all students in the yellow, the goal is not to push those students to the yellow.

02:54:56.220 --> 02:54:59.602
We need that information to know where the intra-district gaps are happening.

02:54:59.982 --> 02:55:05.665
But the goal is to bring them up to the state level, to those state targets that we've identified.

02:55:05.965 --> 02:55:08.327
And that's not clear in the performance gaps.

02:55:08.407 --> 02:55:10.648
This reads more as an intra-district,

02:55:11.408 --> 02:55:17.491
gap analysis versus let's look at our gap analysis and then move them towards the state target.

02:55:17.891 --> 02:55:22.213
So that needs, I don't know if that was the intent or if it just needs clarification.

02:55:22.333 --> 02:55:26.054
So was that the intent, just to move them to all students?

02:55:27.055 --> 02:55:33.357
It is to evaluate at the district level, interdistrict, as far as the performance gaps within the district itself, yes.

02:55:33.998 --> 02:55:37.479
So then at what point do we move them towards the state targets?

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:39.240
I don't,

02:55:40.342 --> 02:55:40.962
I don't know.

02:55:41.302 --> 02:56:00.767
As far as within the LCAP itself is reflective and is a tool of their progression toward continuous improvement, and I don't know how that would be articulated to then move, and the expectation is to move within their plans to move or articulate that expectation within the plan summary.

02:56:01.540 --> 02:56:04.822
And I think that's gonna be one of the tensions that I know we're gonna talk about the S.S.

02:56:04.862 --> 02:56:20.091
State Plan in January, but there's so many things that we do need to be mindful of, because this is geared towards LEAs, and moving towards that state target, we'll have to identify that timeline in our S.S.

02:56:20.131 --> 02:56:21.872
State Plan for schools.

02:56:22.573 --> 02:56:24.234
That's different than districts, but,

02:56:25.316 --> 02:56:29.659
isn't the goal also to move our students towards a state target at the LEA level?

02:56:30.219 --> 02:56:32.220
And if so, that's not explicit here.

02:56:32.961 --> 02:56:43.688
But moving our students towards, to narrowing achievement gaps in intra-district analysis, where the district itself may be well below our state target, I don't know if that's what we want to encourage.

02:56:47.130 --> 02:56:47.510
Thoughts?

02:56:54.212 --> 02:56:56.333
Member Burr, you have your liaison here.

02:56:56.373 --> 02:57:01.976
Do you have any thoughts about this?

02:57:02.196 --> 02:57:10.761
I think we just sort of have to go back to the original premise of the accountability structure and the status and growth is within LEAs.

02:57:11.521 --> 02:57:17.224
I don't know, candidly, I'm gonna look at Dave here, because I know there are people assume that we have picked a target.

02:57:17.244 --> 02:57:19.566
I don't know that we have picked a target.

02:57:21.207 --> 02:57:30.198
So we're sort of back into this conversation about, and I know my friend Feliz and I disagree about the importance of ESSA, so we won't get into.

02:57:30.218 --> 02:57:30.879
And baseball.

02:57:30.899 --> 02:57:32.881
And baseball, Dodgers and Giants also.

02:57:35.204 --> 02:57:36.825
But we're much friendlier about that.

02:57:39.136 --> 02:57:44.761
So, again, I think we probably have to have a more robust discussion back in the accountability.

02:57:44.881 --> 02:57:48.104
We'll do that again in January as we talk about growth, et cetera.

02:57:49.325 --> 02:57:55.011
And I don't know that the LCAP is necessarily the tool for that conversation, I guess is kind of my thought about it.

02:57:55.451 --> 02:58:00.416
The question is whether or not, for purposes in my mind, Feliza, is at the local level

02:58:01.036 --> 02:58:02.617
Is this an improved tool?

02:58:03.177 --> 02:58:10.619
Does it help walk LEAs through the kinds of considerations they should be thinking about with respect to their goals and their improvement?

02:58:11.680 --> 02:58:15.741
I think your question is a bigger one that probably demands more conversation.

02:58:16.822 --> 02:58:20.283
Can you clarify the target question though for me, Dave, because I'm confused too.

02:58:24.488 --> 02:58:26.729
David Sapp, Deputy Policy Director with State Board.

02:58:27.509 --> 02:58:52.279
The concept of a state goal or target is part of the ESSA, the federal law, and so that specific in question, which is several of the indicators required under ESSA, that's a statutory requirement under federal law to include long-term goals for, this is for the assessment indicator and the English learner progress indicator in particular.

02:58:54.301 --> 02:58:55.783
And graduation rates, sorry I left one out.

02:58:56.323 --> 02:59:06.155
So that is part of the state plan conversation that's actually included in, this will be part of the next item that's discussed, sort of when that part of the conversation will occur.

02:59:07.036 --> 02:59:12.943
In terms of the approved methodology for the state indicators in the evaluation rubrics,

02:59:13.523 --> 02:59:42.755
the sort of framework for talking about this idea of getting to green that I think that Eric Crane from West said in presenting some of this information, that if you look at progress and improvement over time, that that can serve as sort of the overall performance framework, but the idea of a specific action that this is a state target or goal, the Board hasn't taken that action, and there will need to be some discussion of that in the ESSA context for at least those three indicators.

02:59:44.739 --> 02:59:45.014
Go ahead.

02:59:48.389 --> 03:00:02.699
So putting the ESSA requirements and mandates aside, I think that as educators, as policy makers, as stakeholders, I think it's to our benefit, or we should be concerned, where are we going?

03:00:02.839 --> 03:00:15.148
So we have additional funding, we have an LCAP template, we have students that are underperforming, some students that are overperforming, and that's great, but when I, as a parent,

03:00:15.968 --> 03:00:19.851
looking at an LCAP template, where is my district going?

03:00:20.552 --> 03:00:22.553
What is guiding our decisions?

03:00:22.833 --> 03:00:24.314
Shouldn't it be, where are we heading?

03:00:24.334 --> 03:00:25.896
What is our North Star, right?

03:00:25.976 --> 03:00:40.346
And so for me saying that, well, that's ESSA, okay, that's a conversation that could be deferred, but when stakeholders are looking at this and they're looking at their performance levels, what is the goal then?

03:00:40.526 --> 03:00:44.750
Where are we moving towards if we have no direct,

03:00:46.511 --> 03:00:54.618
we don't have a target that they have to meet, what is the direction that we're hoping to, what's the vision, what's the direction here?

03:00:55.538 --> 03:01:11.671
Because just saying, hey, we just have to move students, we could be moving them from red to orange and from orange to yellow, and that is continuous improvement, but at some point, we do want to make sure that students are also at the higher end of the spectrum, and if that's not,

03:01:13.092 --> 03:01:20.997
stated anywhere, I do worry that continuous improvement does not actually, will take us to achievement.

03:01:24.557 --> 03:01:34.724
But it seems to me partly that this is an interaction between the template, which we were considering today, and the rubric, and how those two interact with each other.

03:01:34.744 --> 03:01:43.310
Now that we have the rubric, when we did the template the first time, we didn't have the rubric, and that was inherently a problem.

03:01:43.890 --> 03:01:49.834
So can you talk a little bit more about how the template and the rubric interact in this draft?

03:01:50.751 --> 03:02:04.969
Well, I think it informs their both tools and it informs the development of the tools or development of the LCAP and the goals at the local level based on their evaluation and based on their performance of where they are and where they're going to go and how they're going to get there in incremental steps.

03:02:05.430 --> 03:02:08.514
This plan is a three-year plan which allows for some

03:02:09.795 --> 03:02:20.203
strategic planning long term, looking where they are and where they want to be in three years and how they're going to get there and evaluate that through both a local evaluation and the evaluation rubrics.

03:02:20.604 --> 03:02:28.910
The evaluation rubrics and attorneys can talk about how they will also trigger any technical assistance as far as growth or lack of growth.

03:02:29.491 --> 03:02:36.316
But they're tied together to inform at the local level what their needs are and how they're going to progress forward.

03:02:37.867 --> 03:02:39.049
Well, where's that on the form?

03:02:41.092 --> 03:02:42.595
Can you go back to where that is?

03:02:43.376 --> 03:02:44.578
Because you went through it.

03:02:46.161 --> 03:02:49.366
It's in the plan summary on page two of the plan summary.

03:02:49.426 --> 03:02:50.207
It talks about

03:02:55.046 --> 03:03:01.970
Yeah, well, page two, where it talks about the review of performance, the first section is the greatest process.

03:03:02.010 --> 03:03:03.431
The second one, progress.

03:03:03.891 --> 03:03:08.254
The second one is, it explicitly ties to the LCF rubrics.

03:03:08.334 --> 03:03:14.277
Identify any state or local indicator for which overall performance was in the red or orange.

03:03:14.317 --> 03:03:16.198
I think Feliza was talking about that a minute ago.

03:03:16.698 --> 03:03:18.399
That's the idea, to call it out.

03:03:18.419 --> 03:03:19.560
You've looked at your rubric.

03:03:19.580 --> 03:03:20.100
In the plan, some.

03:03:20.120 --> 03:03:20.180
Yes.

03:03:20.200 --> 03:03:20.380
Okay.

03:03:20.400 --> 03:03:24.823
Go ahead.

03:03:27.065 --> 03:03:28.266
I think you added to my case.

03:03:28.446 --> 03:03:35.351
If that is the plan to make it more streamlined, then we should be more consistent with our terminology and our vision.

03:03:35.551 --> 03:03:48.540
If the evaluation rubric will be that tool that will help us identify where we want to go with our students and move them towards that state, and right now we just have that green category, then that should be a little more explicit here.

03:03:50.101 --> 03:03:55.265
And if somebody picks this up and doesn't know that they're related, that's a problem too.

03:04:02.482 --> 03:04:04.744
And other board member comments?

03:04:06.965 --> 03:04:07.806
Board member Rucker.

03:04:08.646 --> 03:04:18.813
Well, so let's take a look at what it is we actually are doing by approving this template and how we've gotten to this point from where we started.

03:04:19.334 --> 03:04:30.842
When we first implemented the LCAP, I remember the most important statement that board member Burr made was that, and I'm going to not say it correctly,

03:04:31.702 --> 03:04:51.550
was that we're kind of giving LEAs a pass on what they're doing in developing these LCAPs, not only because it's new, but because they're being asked to write a school plan using a different frame and without the accountability that the rubric would present to them.

03:04:52.950 --> 03:05:03.717
to inform some of the goals that they would write, and even in doing the revision from year to year, how that would be informed by evidence developed from the rubric would not be present.

03:05:04.418 --> 03:05:15.045
What's different this time is we're going to have an LCAP template and a rubric together, and the idea, or at least the mental model that I have, is that

03:05:15.811 --> 03:05:25.231
The rubric will be populated with information that has been developed both by the department and from the local indicators that districts are beginning to begin working on.

03:05:26.247 --> 03:05:44.052
and that rubric and those local indicators are now going to inform a better written and better defined set of goals and priorities that are aligned to what the rubric says or indicates and the evidence indicates from their local indicators they should be paying attention to.

03:05:44.572 --> 03:05:51.594
That's the big difference this time between how the LCAP was originally developed when we first did the rollout of

03:05:52.603 --> 03:05:55.284
the first three-year LCAP and this new one.

03:05:55.685 --> 03:05:59.546
And so are districts going to get better at writing the LCAP?

03:05:59.566 --> 03:06:01.027
They've had a few years of practice.

03:06:01.307 --> 03:06:03.889
And that answer is yes, they're going to get better at it.

03:06:04.269 --> 03:06:09.891
Are they going to have the same pass on what they're allowed to pay attention to or not think through?

03:06:10.412 --> 03:06:11.132
Well, no.

03:06:11.592 --> 03:06:21.037
It's kind of like when I was an elementary teacher and I had a colleague who liked teaching a unit on dinosaurs, even though we taught the sixth grade and our standards were something else.

03:06:21.537 --> 03:06:26.899
We have to now be informed by what the evidence says we ought to be paying attention to.

03:06:26.959 --> 03:06:37.043
So for all those LCAPs I've read where they wrote these amazing goal statements that 80% of their students are going to be proficient on the assessment by the end of the year,

03:06:37.603 --> 03:06:46.849
they will have data in that rubric that says, here's what the evidence is telling you about the assessment itself and about where your students are.

03:06:47.189 --> 03:06:55.274
So they will write a better goal statement and they will better identify among their students and their subgroups where their priorities are.

03:06:55.374 --> 03:07:03.620
So I'm not as worried about what is going on because our original experience has been they were writing LCAPS uninformed.

03:07:04.581 --> 03:07:05.964
Oh, that was not a good word.

03:07:06.204 --> 03:07:12.860
They were writing LCAPS without the benefit of a rubric to help them understand what they should be looking at.

03:07:13.461 --> 03:07:13.661
Yeah.

03:07:15.101 --> 03:07:16.002
Can you go to the end?

03:07:16.142 --> 03:07:17.443
Go ahead, comment on that then.

03:07:18.204 --> 03:07:31.776
I think also just in terms of the action that the Board is taking is that this is a statutory, the Board was given the responsibility by statute to approve a template for the local accountability plans.

03:07:32.417 --> 03:07:41.685
And part of that statutory mandate includes that it is locally determined goals and identifying the actions and services to implement those goals and the supporting expenditures.

03:07:42.245 --> 03:08:06.614
There's that separate part of the law when it was passed in 2013, which is the state accountability tool, which is the evaluation rubrics, which the board has approved, that includes these performance standards, requires that data be analyzed at the student group level, and ultimately for purposes of assistance and support within the state accountability system, student group performance is what's determinative for state accountability purposes.

03:08:07.434 --> 03:08:21.942
And so in some ways just sort of to focus on the plan summary itself, this was I think responsive to some feedback at the July meeting from the board members saying these are two tools that are required by statute.

03:08:22.342 --> 03:08:33.709
The statute didn't necessarily from an implementation perspective explain how they will be useful and used together to support this local improvement process and to also support state accountability.

03:08:34.469 --> 03:08:42.933
So this is responsive to that direction, to try to provide some coherence in terms of the use of these two tools at the local level.

03:08:43.313 --> 03:09:01.681
But also, I think, and just to add to what Jeff said earlier, to respond to a number of the concerns or criticisms that I think were expressed over the last several years of implementation, and in particular, this question about performance gaps is directly responsive to a number of concerns that have been expressed

03:09:03.162 --> 03:09:10.387
is there differentiation in terms of setting goals or tracking progress on metrics where there are disparities within districts?

03:09:10.627 --> 03:09:15.670
Is that inquiry occurring locally, and is that conversation occurring with local stakeholders?

03:09:16.131 --> 03:09:27.919
That's sort of a preliminary step to then, if there is a disparity at the local level, then there's this question about what's the goal of getting all students, including narrowing or closing that disparity over time?

03:09:28.659 --> 03:09:42.149
So this prompt here, this performance gaps prompt, is actually getting at a different question from the equity report in the evaluation rubrics, which was looking at individual student groups on the overall performance standards.

03:09:42.709 --> 03:09:51.175
This is specifically prompting the inquiry about at the local level, are there disparities that we need to look at in terms of how we're planning our actions and services?

03:09:51.195 --> 03:09:53.717
Because if all students are doing poorly,

03:09:55.178 --> 03:10:03.645
the response to how you do it in terms of your action services might look different than if the overall performance is looking pretty good, but there are a handful of student groups that are really far behind.

03:10:04.586 --> 03:10:05.927
So there is a difference.

03:10:05.967 --> 03:10:12.092
This is not intended to duplicate the equity report from the evaluation rubrics.

03:10:12.132 --> 03:10:17.137
And in fact, some of the feedback that stakeholders provided on the earlier September version

03:10:17.737 --> 03:10:24.244
that used a label that was equity here, was that that was in fact confusing because it is not the identical inquiry.

03:10:24.264 --> 03:10:28.528
It's actually prompting a different inquiry that can support the planning process.

03:10:29.009 --> 03:10:35.115
So I just wanted to provide that clarification that it's grounded in the statutory responsibility that the board has

03:10:35.675 --> 03:10:42.458
that this is the local accountability plan, which is separate from the evaluation, which was the state accountability tool.

03:10:43.779 --> 03:10:57.225
But the board has provided direction to staff to provide some linkage and coherence for local implementation, and also to try to be responsive to some of the concerns or critiques to some of the challenges in implementation thus far.

03:10:57.345 --> 03:11:01.568
So I hope that provides a little clarification, but I just wanted to provide it.

03:11:03.095 --> 03:11:03.935
That was very helpful.

03:11:03.975 --> 03:11:11.999
If I may, Mr. President, just say we can look into January as to how to clarify or further develop some of the questions and responses.

03:11:12.019 --> 03:11:19.902
I was going to ask Glenn Price if you had any thoughts to add to that great report we just had in terms of the multiple goals and structures.

03:11:20.343 --> 03:11:23.424
Before he speaks, can you put the annual update up there?

03:11:23.444 --> 03:11:25.265
You went through this really fast.

03:11:29.339 --> 03:11:31.841
That's another place you can get at these issues.

03:11:31.941 --> 03:11:34.683
Okay, so, Jesus, I can't read any of that.

03:11:34.743 --> 03:11:38.386
I mean, that's why I didn't get it.

03:11:38.426 --> 03:11:39.206
What's in there?

03:11:40.747 --> 03:11:53.817
The bottom prompt reads, describe any changes made to this goal, expected outcomes, metrics, or actions and services to achieve this goal as a result of the analysis and analysis of the data provided in the LCFF evaluation rubrics.

03:11:58.917 --> 03:12:02.680
as applicable, and then identify where those changes can be found within the LCAP.

03:12:02.700 --> 03:12:23.934
So again, it leaks back to using the evaluation rubrics as a tool, looking at the data, where are you as an LEA, where have you gone, where are you going, and what are the evaluation rubrics showing you, and then how are you taking that into effect to inform either a revision of a goal or to write a new goal to get where you need to be.

03:12:24.314 --> 03:12:27.516
As Member Rucker said, now they have this information

03:12:28.997 --> 03:12:29.638
to be able to.

03:12:29.658 --> 03:12:31.439
Provide that map to get to move forward.

03:12:33.581 --> 03:12:35.423
Seems to me Glenn wants to comment.

03:12:35.523 --> 03:12:42.128
It seems to me that's more where this interaction might take place, and we had some concerns with the.

03:12:42.969 --> 03:12:45.791
Prior past effectiveness of the annual update.

03:12:45.851 --> 03:12:47.873
I had a lot higher expectations for

03:12:55.038 --> 03:13:10.109
So just wanted to further comment a little bit on the proposed plan summary and the questions from Board Member Ortiz-Licon, and just to compliment the comments of David Stapp, which I thought were tremendously on point.

03:13:10.709 --> 03:13:15.817
What we're trying to do in the plan summary, and let's recall again that this is a new feature in the LCAP.

03:13:16.278 --> 03:13:26.433
Many LEAs have already been doing plan summaries very effectively, but now we're asking for every LEA, when they complete their local control and county building plan, to include a plan summary which we think will be

03:13:26.813 --> 03:13:34.838
an excellent communications device for broad segments of the public that may not want to dive into the entirety of the LCAP.

03:13:35.399 --> 03:13:42.503
In terms of the North Star, I think we're providing that opportunity in that first box, the story, which we're basically saying, tell us your story.

03:13:42.563 --> 03:13:44.965
Tell us what your North Star is for your community.

03:13:45.365 --> 03:13:52.196
and how you plan to respond to that, and what are the highlights in your LCAP where you can be addressing that?

03:13:52.236 --> 03:13:59.047
So providing that capacity to really articulate for the community and for the state at large, where are you headed?

03:13:59.807 --> 03:14:10.132
Then in the second part of the proposed plan summary, and I think it's important, as Dave was getting at too, to view this as a totality, as opposed to the different components.

03:14:10.472 --> 03:14:21.617
Starting out, tell us where you've made your greatest progress, because we know that it's important to be celebrating accomplishments and celebrating successes as we move forward.

03:14:22.017 --> 03:14:25.599
And then to look at the greatest needs and the performance gap,

03:14:26.039 --> 03:14:51.157
as a combination, so as Dave was articulating, in the greatest needs, we're specifically asking LEAs to reflect back to us, and it's not abrogating any of the responsibilities that Dave articulated around the use of the LCF evaluation rubrics, but tell us where your greatest needs are in terms of those areas where you have red or oranges on your evaluation rubrics, and what you intend to do about that.

03:14:51.884 --> 03:15:03.310
But we knew that then precisely the equity issue wouldn't get entirely addressed unless we added a third box, and this evolved over time in terms of the performance gaps.

03:15:03.371 --> 03:15:14.837
And it's equally relevant for those districts that are performing very well and that have many greens and blues as those that have a lot of yellows and oranges.

03:15:15.197 --> 03:15:27.504
because even in the greens and blues, tell us where you have groups or areas, indicators that are trailing behind and that you want to improve on through your actions in the LCAP.

03:15:27.844 --> 03:15:30.326
So I think when we look at it all together,

03:15:30.826 --> 03:15:34.348
It provides that capacity for LEA to tell the story.

03:15:34.808 --> 03:15:36.509
As Jeff mentioned, is it perfect?

03:15:36.869 --> 03:15:37.669
No, it's not.

03:15:37.910 --> 03:15:46.594
We recognize that, and we know that this, we want to be continuing to look at it, but we think it provides a great step forward for our LEAs.

03:15:48.795 --> 03:15:54.858
I continue to think the annual update is where this concern ought to be located, not in a planned summary.

03:15:55.058 --> 03:15:59.300
I mean, that's, if you look at the plan update, and it,

03:15:59.975 --> 03:16:03.877
You know, I guess the issue is it seems to imply what you're talking about.

03:16:03.917 --> 03:16:18.825
I guess what you're concerned about is, uh, the lack of state targets in the plan update because what I read is the local set local goals and then they and the update they consider how they how they did on those.

03:16:18.965 --> 03:16:29.151
And so it is, uh, there are, you know, the update should produce that kind of thing around the local goals and whether they're reaching them.

03:16:29.891 --> 03:16:40.782
And there is that capacity in the annual update, and I know it's not legible on the screen, but the full template is included in your packet as an attachment at full size.

03:16:41.283 --> 03:16:48.690
And within the actions and services, there's what you proposed, and then as you update, an update around how did you do?

03:16:49.551 --> 03:16:52.254
What was the actual performance in relationship to that?

03:16:52.894 --> 03:17:18.414
The other piece here that we probably also want to keep in mind is the tremendous opportunity that we have as a state right now through the investment that's being made in the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence in terms of a lot of the support and actual continuous improvement that will be made will come out of the professional learning and development that takes place as part of the collaborative's work with LEAs around the state.

03:17:21.576 --> 03:17:22.237
Board Memorandum.

03:17:23.149 --> 03:17:25.714
I, too, want to thank you, Dave, for your explanation.

03:17:25.794 --> 03:17:26.194
It's great.

03:17:26.254 --> 03:17:34.168
So you're going to give your phone number to every principal and every superintendent so you can give that sort of level of clarity.

03:17:35.660 --> 03:17:55.705
I'm joking, of course, but at the same time, I do think this is a real concern, a real problem, that as we sit here, we need Dave and Glenn and all the rest of you to explain this to us, and I'm thinking about the poor school administrators out there that are going to have to somehow, as I think it was Martha from AXA said, pull from,

03:17:56.765 --> 03:18:02.046
weeks and weeks and weeks ago, months ago, all these different iterations that we've been through.

03:18:02.066 --> 03:18:09.688
I think the department did a wonderful job when SBAC came out of explaining what this creature is.

03:18:10.408 --> 03:18:23.051
And I suspect that now's the time that we've gotten far enough along with the accountability system, with the LCAP, with LCFF and all the rest, it's time to have a concise,

03:18:25.451 --> 03:18:32.239
informational packet that parents and the students and the administrators could all sort of refer to in a clear way.

03:18:32.319 --> 03:18:34.061
How do these pieces work together now?

03:18:34.161 --> 03:18:35.483
How does this vision come together?

03:18:36.244 --> 03:18:38.526
And once again, I think it was Martha that suggested this.

03:18:39.127 --> 03:18:40.449
I think that's a brilliant idea.

03:18:40.629 --> 03:18:43.512
And it's been, I know that within the,

03:18:45.534 --> 03:18:50.596
the LCAP template, you've got all sorts of instructions, right, and all sorts of information.

03:18:50.996 --> 03:19:02.300
But at the same time, something sort of overarching that pulls the pieces together, I think could really be answering a lot of these questions for a lot of people that don't have the benefit of data and all the rest of you.

03:19:02.600 --> 03:19:02.840
Thanks.

03:19:03.652 --> 03:19:07.696
Point well taken, and we definitely intend to do that.

03:19:07.736 --> 03:19:22.369
We also intend to reconvene the Superintendent's Accountability and Continuous Improvement Task Force, which brings together many stakeholders in order to be able to push out and problem solve around those kinds of issues and communication strategies as they develop.

03:19:25.912 --> 03:19:26.993
Board Member Ortiz-Lacon.

03:19:29.285 --> 03:19:32.746
And again, I want to emphasize that I think this is a huge improvement.

03:19:32.786 --> 03:19:34.527
I know a lot of work has gone into this.

03:19:34.607 --> 03:19:35.948
It's been a collaborative process.

03:19:36.848 --> 03:19:44.611
I think that my only concern remains that even if a district has the flexibility to set their own performance targets,

03:19:45.271 --> 03:20:06.181
how do we ensure that students across the state of California are all held to some level of high performance and that they are actually moving towards that, not just making some improvement, but making substantial improvement so they're well prepared for college and career from K-12, that we have those high expectations and that something's driving this.

03:20:06.621 --> 03:20:11.864
Now, maybe it's just my concern, if you agree, wink twice as you come.

03:20:12.424 --> 03:20:30.655
because I'm not hearing any echoes, but I think that it's a concern that I don't know, and maybe I'm just thinking in terms of the previous system, there was, for good or bad, there was a state target, and a lot of the work was emphasized in how do we move students towards that target.

03:20:31.015 --> 03:20:37.238
And in the absence of that, moving students, in my opinion, is great, may not be enough.

03:20:37.619 --> 03:20:37.899
Thank you.

03:20:39.207 --> 03:20:43.371
Yeah, just just to clarify this, you know, my own edification here as well.

03:20:43.931 --> 03:20:56.021
I mean, the annual update says use actual annual measurable outcome data, including performance data from the LCFF evaluation rubrics as applicable.

03:20:56.402 --> 03:20:57.523
And there's several under that.

03:20:57.643 --> 03:20:58.503
But one of them is

03:20:59.924 --> 03:21:08.909
describe the overall effectiveness of the action services to achieve the articulated goal as measured by the LEA.

03:21:09.309 --> 03:21:14.992
So it is, you know, that's really, we never had anything like that before because we never had a rubric.

03:21:15.372 --> 03:21:17.953
So the annual update was sort of toothless.

03:21:18.033 --> 03:21:19.294
It really didn't do much.

03:21:20.734 --> 03:21:29.317
So it has at least we have here for local goals, not state targets of this linkage that we've been seeking.

03:21:29.457 --> 03:21:31.918
So I just want to clarify that for the board.

03:21:33.499 --> 03:21:33.679
All right.

03:21:33.719 --> 03:21:41.362
Any further board comments or Yeah, I know there's public comment, but it's five after 12.

03:21:41.782 --> 03:21:43.822
So maybe we should we should adjourn for lunch.

03:21:53.277 --> 03:21:56.600
Okay, if we want to take the public comment, let's go ahead.

03:21:59.442 --> 03:22:01.605
Could we have the following people please line up?

03:22:01.785 --> 03:22:10.033
Kelly May, Doug McCray, Patty Scripter, Brian Rivas, Sheila Whitley, Jesse Aguilar, Lorraine Richards, Ken Burt,

03:22:11.986 --> 03:22:29.398
Angela DeRamos, Estella Mu, Martha Alvarez, Sandy Mendoza, John Elfeld, Liz Guillen, Tia Nguyen, Michelle Parise, Sergio Luna, Eric Premack, Terry Burns, Sarah Lillis, Colin Miller, and Samantha Tran.

03:22:44.091 --> 03:22:44.331
Ready?

03:22:47.413 --> 03:22:51.916
Good afternoon, I'm Doug McRae, retired educational measurement specialist.

03:22:52.916 --> 03:22:56.578
The words local control and accountability are fundamentally in conflict.

03:22:57.239 --> 03:23:02.162
The LCAP template is essentially a strategic planning process, not an accountability exercise.

03:23:02.922 --> 03:23:10.747
The title LCAP is not unlike the title SARC, for School Accountability Report Card, which is a data transparency program rather than an accountability program.

03:23:12.028 --> 03:23:14.610
In this country, we don't allow students to self-assign grades.

03:23:14.750 --> 03:23:17.292
We don't allow employees to self-determine compensation.

03:23:17.592 --> 03:23:24.238
Rather, these accountability functions are carried out by people responsible for judging student employee performance.

03:23:24.478 --> 03:23:27.260
Strategic planning programs are good for districts.

03:23:28.101 --> 03:23:33.045
Both financial decisions and curriculum instruction decisions should be left to local control.

03:23:33.823 --> 03:23:46.694
But statewide assessment and accountability require decisions at the state level, not the local level, to generate required comparability for districts and schools for the entire state.

03:23:46.774 --> 03:23:49.917
The sooner we accept these distinctions, in my view, the better.

03:23:50.598 --> 03:23:50.858
Thank you.

03:23:55.768 --> 03:23:57.868
Patty Scripter, California State PTA.

03:23:58.368 --> 03:24:13.311
Regarding the stakeholder engagement piece, we believe that the additions to the template are an improvement, but we suggest that the description for stakeholder engagement include the process used for the PAC, the DAC, and the DLAC.

03:24:13.571 --> 03:24:25.033
That's the question we get most often at the local level because of the confusion between the LCAP committee and the statutory requirements for the PAC, DAC, and DLAC, and we think this would contribute to a more transparent

03:24:25.773 --> 03:24:26.273
process.

03:24:27.814 --> 03:24:35.296
We also think that you should add a box between the process and the impact about what the feedback was.

03:24:35.676 --> 03:24:43.258
This is a great communication tool and it's a way to value the input received is to report that out as part of the process.

03:24:44.358 --> 03:24:47.940
I led with that, and I'm going to go back and say we think this has been a great process.

03:24:48.020 --> 03:24:49.982
It's definitely an improvement.

03:24:50.462 --> 03:24:53.284
The reordered process is more accessible information.

03:24:53.744 --> 03:24:55.905
We support the addition of the plan summary.

03:24:56.065 --> 03:24:58.227
Again, that's more accessible to parent.

03:24:58.967 --> 03:25:01.469
It's a great way to communicate the story.

03:25:01.829 --> 03:25:09.514
We think for the performance gaps that the wording should be strengthened to actions that narrow and close gaps, not just address gaps.

03:25:10.114 --> 03:25:20.530
And we also think the addition of the budget summary is key to having parents and stakeholders understand how the funds are spent, and it increases the transparency of the process.

03:25:20.610 --> 03:25:20.930
Thank you.

03:25:27.159 --> 03:25:30.400
Mr. President, Brian Rivas on behalf of the Education Trust West.

03:25:31.640 --> 03:25:32.360
Couple of points.

03:25:32.420 --> 03:25:35.501
We want to thank you and your staff for continuing to work on this.

03:25:35.721 --> 03:25:36.842
We see improvement.

03:25:37.202 --> 03:25:38.322
We know it's been a challenge.

03:25:39.882 --> 03:25:50.525
But I know that, I think Member Holiday was being a bit facetious, but I do want to lift up that I think it's a problem that you all didn't understand the template until Mr. Sapp explained it to you.

03:25:50.545 --> 03:25:56.227
I think that confusion and lack of clarity has been a problem that has plagued the LCAP.

03:25:56.947 --> 03:26:00.908
and I think it's representative of a problem that we all should continue to work on.

03:26:01.628 --> 03:26:22.374
And with regard to this gap section in particular, I think we agree with Member Ortiz-Licon that it's a problem to have something in here that suggests if you had a district that was made up of white and Latino students with a very low level of achievement for everyone, thus having a small gap, that you don't have an equity problem and that everything's okay.

03:26:22.834 --> 03:26:29.068
So we would ask that you try to align this with all the other stuff that you're doing on equity and send consistent messages.

03:26:35.186 --> 03:26:37.587
Eric Premack, Charter Schools Development Center.

03:26:37.627 --> 03:26:48.130
We're extremely appreciative of the work that CDE staff, Mr. Brashears in particular, spent a good deal of time with us looking at very detailed comments and made a lot of helpful clarifications here.

03:26:48.810 --> 03:26:50.630
And we're super appreciative of that.

03:26:51.191 --> 03:26:53.831
We think that this is a significant step forward.

03:26:54.231 --> 03:27:02.954
We think that additional clarity, if you really wanna make a leap forward, you gotta go back and open up Pandora's box and look at the 22 priorities and sort through those.

03:27:03.996 --> 03:27:10.310
Absent being willing to do that, I think they've pushed this about as far, pretty close to as far as we're going to get.

03:27:10.590 --> 03:27:13.036
And we're really very much thankful for that.

03:27:13.116 --> 03:27:13.336
Thanks.

03:27:21.018 --> 03:27:28.201
President Kurse, Superintendent Torlakson, board members, Estella Mu with the California Teachers Association.

03:27:28.822 --> 03:27:44.189
On behalf of the California Teachers Association, I want to thank the board, the department of your respective staffs for the continuing efforts to engage all stakeholders and improve to the LCAP and the annual update template.

03:27:44.649 --> 03:27:48.451
We have known from the inception of the LCFF that this

03:27:49.132 --> 03:27:55.824
This effort will take, in the words of President Kurz, patience, persistence, and humility.

03:27:57.140 --> 03:28:03.344
Overall, we believe the revised template is improved in many respects and worthy of approval.

03:28:04.365 --> 03:28:18.915
In particular, CTA believes the new plan summary will help districts, charter schools, and county offices of education tell their stories succinctly and highlight strengths and areas in need of attention.

03:28:20.656 --> 03:28:41.224
The new instructions will prompt reflection on LCAP goals, local assessments, stakeholder feedback, and the evaluation rubrics, with attention to the results of increases and improvements in services for our students from low-income families, English learners, and foster youth.

03:28:41.904 --> 03:28:51.967
The graphical improvements and streamlined layout of the template should also make it easier for stakeholders to read and understand.

03:28:52.827 --> 03:29:10.171
As the new template is implemented, and we collectively strive to meet the needs of all of our students, we expect additional refinements may be needed, particularly to ensure stakeholders receive feedback on how their input was considered.

03:29:11.031 --> 03:29:14.912
We believe that the template before you is a good starting point.

03:29:15.513 --> 03:29:29.637
If paired with high quality training, capacity building, and stakeholder engagement, the improved form and instructions should result in more effective planning and continuous improvement practices.

03:29:30.118 --> 03:29:31.178
We thank you very much.

03:29:40.185 --> 03:29:43.968
Good afternoon, Sandra Morales with the County Superintendent's Association.

03:29:44.368 --> 03:29:51.653
First, I'd like to echo the comments from Stela Vieux in expressing appreciation for the stakeholder engagement during this process.

03:29:51.713 --> 03:30:05.843
When the CDE set up to revise the template, the one thing that we ask is that it was practitioner-driven, that let's learn from those experiences and improve this template as we expect that this will continue to improve over time.

03:30:06.443 --> 03:30:13.028
So much of what you see in here in this template reflects a lot of the feedback that we received from those practitioners.

03:30:13.588 --> 03:30:24.976
So we just want to let you know that county offices stand ready to support districts on their development of the template, working with the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence to ensure that

03:30:25.456 --> 03:30:38.882
Our messages are aligned, that there's no confusion in the field, and just like Board Member Holliday mentioned that when the SBAC was rolled out, the communication was successful and everybody understood what it was, that is our goal here too.

03:30:39.363 --> 03:30:47.567
County offices with the collaborative and with the help of other management education associations, we hope that we can achieve that as well.

03:30:48.067 --> 03:30:48.327
Thank you.

03:30:51.710 --> 03:30:53.372
Good afternoon, Marta Alvarez-Axa.

03:30:54.013 --> 03:31:01.602
So similar to other speakers, we want to thank the staff and Jeff Breshears and everyone else who was involved over the past six months in developing the revised LCAP.

03:31:02.063 --> 03:31:07.650
As it was indicated by prior speakers, even though it's not perfect, it's an improvement in the layout and the content.

03:31:08.090 --> 03:31:18.503
We at AXA appreciate the better integration and alignment between the evaluation rubrics references and what needs to happen whenever there's a stakeholder process in talking about goals and priorities and services.

03:31:19.264 --> 03:31:23.529
I do want to point out two comments from AXA and two recommendations for your consideration in the future.

03:31:24.169 --> 03:31:29.590
One is we ask the board to have commitment to not make any changes for at least the next two or three years.

03:31:29.970 --> 03:31:31.691
This is the third LCAP we have seen.

03:31:32.091 --> 03:31:43.593
Our members need time to be able to really embrace it, to be able to work with what we have, and so at least try to, we'll learn from the field as they continue to work on the revised LCAP for 17-18, but please stop making changes to it.

03:31:44.193 --> 03:31:50.755
The second piece is in order for our members to embrace the LCAP as a planning tool, thinking about continuous improvement over the long term,

03:31:51.295 --> 03:32:07.831
It really needs to have, you need to have a conversation about the streamlining of other plans, LEA, school site plans, SARC, because that's a bigger monster to tackle, but it's really problematic if we have this as more of a compliance tool instead of being able to streamline everything.

03:32:08.171 --> 03:32:08.492
Thank you.

03:32:11.508 --> 03:32:16.794
Afternoon, Terry Burns with the California School Boards Association, and I'll associate myself with all of Ms.

03:32:16.854 --> 03:32:17.896
Alvarez's remarks.

03:32:18.917 --> 03:32:22.401
We believe this is an improved template.

03:32:22.421 --> 03:32:31.592
While likely no shorter than the current version, we believe that the inclusion of introductory sheets that summarize the focus and the vision will be really helpful.

03:32:32.032 --> 03:32:33.893
to communicate this to our parents.

03:32:34.313 --> 03:32:42.316
We appreciate the inclusion of a section that allows us to celebrate successes, as well as recognize areas in need of improvement.

03:32:43.196 --> 03:32:48.538
We believe that it meets your principles of transparency, simplicity, clarity, and efficacy for planning.

03:32:49.158 --> 03:32:54.220
And we appreciate your timely adoption so that we can start doing the data transfers that are necessary.

03:32:55.020 --> 03:32:59.202
Capacity remains a concern, particularly in small districts, to complete the document.

03:32:59.922 --> 03:33:04.746
and for all LEAs to effectively communicate what it means to stakeholders.

03:33:06.107 --> 03:33:14.473
I must take issue with Member Lincoln's, Ortiz-Lincoln's concern, expression that schools have more money.

03:33:16.075 --> 03:33:18.597
LCFF is still not sufficiently funded.

03:33:18.997 --> 03:33:29.265
Funding is likely to be flat for the next three years, and we're facing incredible costs from instructional materials, adoptions, and retirement costs.

03:33:29.507 --> 03:33:29.837
Thank you.

03:33:33.612 --> 03:33:35.293
Good afternoon, Sarah Lillis with EdVoice.

03:33:35.634 --> 03:33:47.522
I want to thank member Ortiz-Lacogne for raising up these issues, because I think fundamentally the LCAP, the LCFF rubrics are tools to meet our constitutional obligation to ensure an equitable opportunity to learn, and that's sort of where we keep coming back.

03:33:47.903 --> 03:33:56.069
And I think remembering when we're talking about gaps, fundamentally we're talking about gaps from where we are and where we want all of our students to be.

03:33:56.409 --> 03:33:59.811
And so while we recognize the importance of looking at intradistrict gaps,

03:34:00.952 --> 03:34:23.285
Fundamentally, by defining that section of the performance gaps only as two performance levels apart, we're losing an opportunity to highlight subgroups that have huge gaps between where they are and where we want them to be, because the previous box is about overall performance, rather than, again, highlighting subgroups that are red and orange.

03:34:23.325 --> 03:34:28.988
So we appreciate the conversation, and hopefully we continue to use this as a tool for equity.

03:34:29.108 --> 03:34:29.348
Thank you.

03:34:33.197 --> 03:34:35.960
Good afternoon, Colin Miller with the California Charter Schools Association.

03:34:36.001 --> 03:34:43.870
First of all, I want to thank Jeff Breshears and the staff for modeling the type of stakeholder engagement that we expect from all our LEAs.

03:34:44.951 --> 03:34:52.601
He's been very collaborative in this process, and I think the resulting template and instructions reflect that in a very positive way.

03:34:53.301 --> 03:34:58.366
So we're very pleased with the new improvements to the template.

03:34:58.966 --> 03:35:10.056
Obviously we'll know more and have more feedback as we start putting pencil to paper and working with the tool, but we're very encouraged with the work that's been done so far.

03:35:10.536 --> 03:35:18.082
So in the interest of good policy and lunch before you, we encourage you to move swiftly to adopt the staff recommendation.

03:35:18.122 --> 03:35:18.363
Thank you.

03:35:21.949 --> 03:35:36.975
Hello, Sandy Mendoza, Families in Schools, and I appreciate hearing that earlier comment about not changing anything anymore because it is important for people to get used to what we're working with, especially for parents so that they get accustomed to what they're dealing with over time.

03:35:37.315 --> 03:35:45.719
But at the same time, if that's what we want to do, we need to really make this work and make it right getting out of the chute here.

03:35:45.759 --> 03:35:49.080
So let's make sure it's right before we start messing with it.

03:35:50.160 --> 03:35:58.705
The other thing I want to say is that we are appreciative of the instruction to call different committees, such as the PAC, the ELAC, and SSC for further input.

03:35:59.025 --> 03:36:09.811
We also appreciate adding a citation for making sure that translation of materials are in the language that they need to be for other materials, and also that the LCAP

03:36:10.371 --> 03:36:19.120
includes instructions for, well, we think there should be instruction for how would parents address getting the material if they don't have internet.

03:36:19.160 --> 03:36:21.282
So what kind of instructions would that include?

03:36:21.402 --> 03:36:21.703
Thank you.

03:36:25.325 --> 03:36:33.991
Samantha Tran with Children Now, and I want to echo the theme of appreciating Jeff and the team's work to really engage stakeholders on this process.

03:36:34.172 --> 03:36:41.937
We like the design elements, it's moving in the right direction, and also appreciate the intentionality of trying to connect it with the evaluation rubric.

03:36:41.957 --> 03:36:45.460
We'll see how that unfolds as it plays out at the local level, but you know,

03:36:45.680 --> 03:37:00.213
As we've seen from previous plans, the data is not always grounded in all the different gaps that are present in a district, and this gives us an opportunity to look in more standardized ways across districts about how kids are doing and to elevate equity in that conversation.

03:37:00.793 --> 03:37:02.735
We continue to have concerns about whether or not we're

03:37:03.175 --> 03:37:13.747
ultimately going to be able to understand how supplemental and concentration dollars are being used in their totality and know that there's some conversations about, you know, how do we think about the account code structure?

03:37:13.827 --> 03:37:15.649
How do we integrate that and link that?

03:37:15.689 --> 03:37:19.092
And that I think that's an important conversation for us moving forward as a state.

03:37:19.293 --> 03:37:19.533
Thank you.

03:37:25.407 --> 03:37:30.834
Good afternoon, John Apfeldt from Public Advocates and the Equity Coalition.

03:37:32.496 --> 03:37:40.466
Number one, we appreciate the budget summary and hopefully we won't see any more instances where districts have

03:37:42.128 --> 03:37:50.633
9% of their LCFF dollars reflected in the LCAP, but have a much greater percentage, and we appreciate maintaining the language.

03:37:50.653 --> 03:37:55.776
This is supposed to be a comprehensive planning tool, not a sliver of what you're doing as a district.

03:37:56.477 --> 03:38:04.582
Appreciate the identification, the notion that every, each district-wide and school-wide,

03:38:06.322 --> 03:38:11.343
Supplemental concentration expenditure needs to be identified and justified in the LCAP.

03:38:11.983 --> 03:38:13.864
These instructions make that much clearer.

03:38:15.124 --> 03:38:22.265
We agree that we don't still have enough transparency around the supplemental concentration.

03:38:22.385 --> 03:38:32.747
It's not a one-to-one categorical get that, but it's also not a get out of proportionality free card, and that we do need a better tracking of

03:38:33.604 --> 03:38:37.940
the effort that was spent and not spent and that needs to be carried over.

03:38:37.980 --> 03:38:38.221
Thanks.

03:38:43.041 --> 03:38:53.767
Martha Zaragoza-Diaz, representing CABE and Californians Together, and I just want to support the comments that John Ethold said with regards to identification of supplemental and concentration funds.

03:38:53.847 --> 03:39:05.093
The information that is on page 11 regarding those funds should also be carried over to page four within the budget plan summary under the projected LCF funds.

03:39:05.313 --> 03:39:08.055
In addition, I appreciate Ms.

03:39:08.115 --> 03:39:11.596
Ortiz-Lincon's comments regarding state targets for subgroups.

03:39:11.696 --> 03:39:12.377
We need to know.

03:39:12.737 --> 03:39:20.505
where we are and where we want to be, not only intradistrict, interdistrict, but with regards to whether we're meeting state goals.

03:39:21.026 --> 03:39:27.412
We need to highlight subgroup academic performance, not only in the red and orange, but perhaps also in the yellow.

03:39:27.753 --> 03:39:28.073
Thank you.

03:39:28.093 --> 03:39:31.496
Okay, that completes the comments.

03:39:31.576 --> 03:39:32.377
Board Member Sun.

03:39:33.719 --> 03:39:35.440
I just want to make a,

03:39:36.423 --> 03:39:38.884
maybe a final comment before we move forward.

03:39:40.064 --> 03:39:45.826
I've been severely silent through this item, not because I haven't had a lot of thoughts, in fact, so many thoughts.

03:39:46.207 --> 03:39:46.887
And filled it out.

03:39:47.207 --> 03:39:51.148
Yeah, that I've had trouble thinking about what to say.

03:39:51.208 --> 03:39:55.590
So I think the tact I'm going to take is from someone who actually has to do this LCAP.

03:39:56.390 --> 03:39:57.811
I think I'm the only one around here.

03:39:58.651 --> 03:40:19.175
And in hearing, I really appreciate David's description of this, because I think as we are talking about wording and wordsmithing pieces of this, I think we need to step back and think about we are building a system here to get at our constitutional obligation to serve all students.

03:40:19.775 --> 03:40:27.557
And I will tell you that this system that we are creating as one person who operates a school, this is,

03:40:28.823 --> 03:40:48.167
making me, my school, more transparent, our information more transparent than it has ever, more transparent than our charter, more transparent than our WASC report, more transparent than our annual audit that we have, this really outlines to our stakeholders what we're doing.

03:40:48.487 --> 03:40:53.588
And this system we're creating between the rubrics and this LCAP plan is truly a

03:40:55.008 --> 03:40:58.830
great system for getting us to that accountability pieces of it.

03:40:59.211 --> 03:41:14.719
So while we're working on all the little bits and pieces, I don't think we need to not lose sight of that we are, we dismantled another system and we are rebuilding it to be stronger and to also allow LEAs and schools,

03:41:15.860 --> 03:41:19.982
some flexibility to be able to achieve those goals.

03:41:20.703 --> 03:41:31.448
And I think that balance of setting the standard, and we have a lot of work still to do that, but at the same time, allowing that local flexibility is really the system that we need.

03:41:31.568 --> 03:41:35.890
And I think we should look at that and be very proud of the progress we have made in that area.

03:41:37.131 --> 03:41:37.532
Thank you.

03:41:38.313 --> 03:41:44.041
Yeah, I wanted to comment on this financial transparency issue, the supplemental and concentration grants.

03:41:45.082 --> 03:41:52.914
I don't think the solution to finding out, you know, what's going on fiscally lies with the LCAP.

03:41:54.374 --> 03:41:56.315
because I don't think the LCAP can do it.

03:41:56.375 --> 03:41:59.376
The underlying systems are, in my view, broken.

03:42:00.556 --> 03:42:04.417
The budget and accounting systems are in huge categories.

03:42:04.977 --> 03:42:09.138
Administration, student services, instruction.

03:42:09.898 --> 03:42:16.460
So if we had a really good accounting system that underlies the LCAP,

03:42:17.500 --> 03:42:22.581
we could do much better, I think, on where the money actually goes.

03:42:23.421 --> 03:42:42.465
And so I think the way to really get at this is not more fiddling with the LCAP, but trying to address the underlying accounting and budgeting categories called SAS and so on that are out there, because they are really opaque.

03:42:43.369 --> 03:42:48.714
And I don't think we can remediate that problem through, you know, LCAP stuff.

03:42:48.794 --> 03:42:53.198
And so I disagree with some of the presenters that that is the way to go.

03:42:53.318 --> 03:42:57.802
I would ask them to help us think about broader financial changes.

03:42:57.902 --> 03:43:07.010
WestEd is working on this, and there may be ways to advance it and make it work.

03:43:07.090 --> 03:43:09.392
But it's a deeper problem.

03:43:10.713 --> 03:43:27.149
In my view, the LCAP is taking the rap for the fact that the accounting systems and so on we ought to tie to are really very general, very opaque, and to me, hide the ball in ways that we're suffering from.

03:43:27.309 --> 03:43:29.110
So that's my own observation.

03:43:29.471 --> 03:43:32.574
There are some people, as I say, WestEd is working on this.

03:43:32.714 --> 03:43:34.876
Others are working on this issue.

03:43:36.778 --> 03:43:45.871
And my view is there's limits to how much we can do through the LCAP without more fundamental change in the budgeting categories.

03:43:46.012 --> 03:43:49.156
So with that, any more board comment?

03:43:49.176 --> 03:43:49.777
And then we're ready.

03:43:50.538 --> 03:43:52.019
All right, so just two comments.

03:43:52.760 --> 03:44:06.912
One, thanks to the department and Jeff and all your leadership and input and watching this process, and I appreciate the stakeholders coming forward and support the CTA comments about with additional capacity building and articulation and engagement.

03:44:07.353 --> 03:44:09.134
This is a much improved process.

03:44:09.194 --> 03:44:13.238
I think nothing is perfect, but I'm hearing from lots of people that we need to move forward.

03:44:13.798 --> 03:44:17.921
do what we've, use what we've gotten and then do it for a couple years and see how that works.

03:44:18.221 --> 03:44:29.908
I just would say some of the extra boxes that for explanation which are really going to help I think in sharing what Member Sung is saying about transparency and sharing with the public what this means.

03:44:30.288 --> 03:44:33.772
I just want to support Ax's comment to continue the work.

03:44:33.833 --> 03:44:44.025
I know CED is working on trying to align SARCs and SPSAs and LEA plans and having written many of those and knowing some are looked at more than others.

03:44:44.145 --> 03:44:48.631
It'd just be nice if all the things connected as we're moving toward a coherent single system

03:44:49.431 --> 03:44:51.573
and I appreciate that all of us are committed that way.

03:44:52.273 --> 03:45:08.105
Deputy Superintendent Price has assured me that it's an ongoing process and there are some progress toward it, but I think we need to keep moving that ball down the field as far as wanting this to work and be connected and guide all of the work, so just a support.

03:45:08.205 --> 03:45:11.668
And with that, I move approval of the CD recommendation.

03:45:11.688 --> 03:45:12.829
Second.

03:45:14.366 --> 03:45:15.067
Second by Burr.

03:45:15.807 --> 03:45:16.208
Okay.

03:45:17.208 --> 03:45:17.569
All right.

03:45:18.189 --> 03:45:18.710
Any further?

03:45:18.850 --> 03:45:20.051
No further board discussion.

03:45:20.111 --> 03:45:21.652
All those in favor, raise your hands.

03:45:22.573 --> 03:45:22.993
Thank you.

03:45:23.013 --> 03:45:24.194
Approved unanimously.

03:45:24.334 --> 03:45:27.357
And so the board will adjourn for lunch.

03:45:27.417 --> 03:45:29.479
We'll be back in three quarters of an hour.

03:45:29.579 --> 03:45:29.999
So it is 1.15.

03:45:35.291 --> 03:45:37.153
Okay, the board will reconvene.

03:45:37.173 --> 03:45:37.694
I have 636.

03:45:39.015 --> 03:45:40.256
Right.

03:45:41.057 --> 03:45:48.164
So we'll begin now with item five, which is the update on the Every Student Succeeds Act.

03:45:49.426 --> 03:45:49.686
Right.

03:45:55.848 --> 03:46:01.570
So good afternoon, President Kirst, Superintendent Torlakson I think is probably coming.

03:46:01.830 --> 03:46:02.770
You're not on.

03:46:03.410 --> 03:46:07.072
I am on, but it's been super low all day just from the audience I've noticed.

03:46:08.272 --> 03:46:08.672
There he is.

03:46:09.793 --> 03:46:16.615
All right, good afternoon, President Kirst, Superintendent Torlakson, board members, I'm Barbara Murchison as the state lead here at the Department of Education.

03:46:17.998 --> 03:46:34.411
The CDE recommends that the board give authority to Superintendent Torlakson to submit with President Kirst a joint response to the proposed regulations for Title One supplement not supplant to United States Department of Education on or before November 7th.

03:46:35.352 --> 03:46:40.336
The CDE also recommends that the board take additional action as necessary and appropriate.

03:46:46.610 --> 03:46:54.552
So before we talk about the plan, I want to spend a few minutes providing you with a brief update on the status of ESSA proposed regulations.

03:46:55.433 --> 03:47:01.234
Long story short, we are still waiting for all three sets of proposed regulations to be finalized.

03:47:02.114 --> 03:47:11.977
Proposed regulations on Title I Supplement Not Supplant were published in the Federal Register on September 6th and are open for a 60-day public comment period that closes on Monday, November 7th, 2016.

03:47:14.438 --> 03:47:17.564
This is the third of three sets of proposed regs that the U.S.

03:47:17.584 --> 03:47:21.310
Department of Education plans to finalize before the end of the year.

03:47:22.552 --> 03:47:28.001
The first two sets of regulations addressed accountability state plans and data reporting and assessments.

03:47:29.423 --> 03:47:38.045
In July, the board authorized President Kirst to sign joint letters with Superintendent Torlakson to provide the state's response to those sets of proposed regs.

03:47:39.006 --> 03:47:50.349
The response to the proposed accountability state plans and data reporting regulations was submitted on August 1st, and the response to the proposed assessment regulations was submitted on September 9th.

03:47:50.829 --> 03:47:55.010
Both of those letters are available on the department as a webpage.

03:47:56.724 --> 03:48:08.982
Department and board staff have been working together to review and analyze the proposed regulations and are preparing a joint response to be submitted upon your approval to again authorize President Kirst to sign on to a letter.

03:48:09.903 --> 03:48:11.345
As noted in the agenda item,

03:48:12.066 --> 03:48:26.975
Staff believes that the regulations exceed federal statute and that the elements contained in the proposed regulations are contrary to California's shift to greater local control centered on providing LEAs the ability to better meet the needs of their most vulnerable students.

03:48:28.137 --> 03:48:40.844
Further, ensuring equity and resources for high-need students and ensuring that Title I funds will be supplemental to state funds can be achieved under the state's current structure without federal intrusion.

03:48:41.565 --> 03:48:49.930
So again, those letters are available on the CDESO webpage, as are all the proposed regulations.

03:48:51.957 --> 03:49:02.544
So, as we've discussed previously, we can't finalize a plan without final regulations, but we continue to move forward with plan development using the information available to us.

03:49:03.505 --> 03:49:12.250
Recall that our current understanding of the structure of the ESSA Consolidated State Plan is based on the proposed regulations around submission of state plans.

03:49:13.191 --> 03:49:18.394
The draft plan provided in this item is built around those proposed regulations.

03:49:19.415 --> 03:49:27.779
We don't anticipate that this structure will change once the regulations are finalized, though it is likely that some of these elements may be removed.

03:49:27.959 --> 03:49:32.621
So as the regulations change, the template and the structure of the plan may change.

03:49:34.381 --> 03:49:43.405
Still, our current understanding is that states will be required to submit a plan using a template organized around the six sections listed on this screen.

03:49:44.185 --> 03:49:59.751
Long-term goals and measurements of interim progress, consultation and coordination, challenging academic standards and academic assessments, accountability, support, and improvement for schools, supporting excellent educators, and supporting all students.

03:50:01.075 --> 03:50:29.094
I'm making a point to share this with you again because as we're talking to our colleagues around the state about this plan, some folks are under the impression that there will be a Title I plan, and then a Title II plan, and then a Title III plan, and California's Consolidated State Plan is obviously going to address all of the programmatic requirements under each of these titles, but it will do so in a consolidated, coherent way organized into these six sections.

03:50:33.328 --> 03:50:40.351
So I'm sure this will come as a great surprise to all of you, but the plan development timeline has changed again since I last saw you.

03:50:41.031 --> 03:50:42.552
I think this may be the last one, though.

03:50:42.572 --> 03:50:43.512
I'm feeling confident.

03:50:43.572 --> 03:50:44.753
I left the asterisk up.

03:50:45.533 --> 03:50:47.154
No.

03:50:47.254 --> 03:50:48.214
Just in case.

03:50:48.854 --> 03:50:55.497
But this new timeline does plan for a July submission date.

03:50:56.137 --> 03:51:02.900
Again, we are waiting for final regs, and we just can't finish a plan without final regs.

03:51:04.358 --> 03:51:15.547
So this timeline lays out for you, and I'm gonna explain just briefly, our plan is to bring three successive drafts to you over the next few meetings.

03:51:16.207 --> 03:51:29.838
So this meeting, we have the very first draft of the state plan, second draft coming in January with new elements as we have more information, and then a complete plan will come to you in March.

03:51:30.618 --> 03:51:39.140
By then we anticipate that we will have final regulations and we will have had lots of time for robust stakeholder engagement and more board conversation.

03:51:39.680 --> 03:51:44.981
We like this new strategy because it allows us not to spend too much time with hypothetical information.

03:51:45.821 --> 03:51:54.983
Although we originally wanted to bring a plan to you in November, why would we spend your time in the time of stakeholders talking about things that may or may not actually happen?

03:51:56.357 --> 03:52:03.080
As you saw in attachment two of the September ESSA item, the plan requires us to address a lot of material.

03:52:03.641 --> 03:52:18.488
This new strategy allows us to chunk that entire plan into three separate drafts so that you and all of California stakeholders can learn as we go about the different elements and have more manageable pieces of information.

03:52:20.040 --> 03:52:25.122
And this also allows us to have much more time for good stakeholder engagement.

03:52:25.623 --> 03:52:32.206
So for each draft, the CPAG will first hear the elements in the draft and be able to provide feedback.

03:52:32.806 --> 03:52:36.968
We can take that into account as we prepare the item to come to you, which is a draft.

03:52:38.809 --> 03:52:42.893
We get more feedback from you and then we put the plan up.

03:52:43.494 --> 03:52:55.687
Each draft of the plan will have its own little public comment period so that we can engage folks in the work that's happening and seek their feedback about what they think is great and what they think might need a little updating.

03:52:56.471 --> 03:53:02.914
So the expanded timeline in attachment one of this item actually shows that detail for each draft.

03:53:03.474 --> 03:53:10.877
CPAG first, board then sees the plan, and then a public comment period so the public can comment on the plan.

03:53:12.594 --> 03:53:41.284
By March, we will have a complete plan with all of the elements presented, and then we will get your feedback, and you're okay to go ahead and start the 30-day public comment period on the plan, and then we'll convene the CPAG, and they will provide comment or feedback to you on the comment, and we are optimistic that in May, we will be able to bring to you a final plan, suggestions for what of the stakeholder feedback should be incorporated,

03:53:41.904 --> 03:53:45.826
And then we'll clean that up and send that to EG in July.

03:53:46.147 --> 03:53:48.948
And then we'll all go on a nice long vacation, right?

03:53:48.968 --> 03:53:52.710
Okay, I will.

03:53:57.458 --> 03:54:07.384
The other thing we like about this, it gives us a little extra time to spend more time with some of the more challenging elements, like how are we going to do our technical assistance?

03:54:07.444 --> 03:54:09.405
What are our state systems of support?

03:54:09.846 --> 03:54:13.468
How are we going to use ESSA resources to support state priorities?

03:54:13.528 --> 03:54:16.230
Those will be coming later rather than sooner.

03:54:17.210 --> 03:54:25.635
So building upon that strategy and timeline, the plan, the draft plan that's been provided to you is attachment two today.

03:54:26.866 --> 03:54:39.555
contains the consultation and coordination section, the challenging academic standards and academic assessment section, and a number of the program-specific requirements that ESSA requires us to address.

03:54:40.556 --> 03:54:47.441
The other state plan sections that will be coming to you in January and March are also listed here on this slide.

03:54:54.420 --> 03:54:56.000
I should be super clear here, though.

03:54:56.060 --> 03:54:59.461
We are not asking for approval of any of these drafts.

03:54:59.941 --> 03:55:02.302
Nobody needs to, well, no, the final one, of course.

03:55:03.502 --> 03:55:05.662
We're not asking for approval of today's draft.

03:55:06.203 --> 03:55:16.985
All of these elements that are shared today and in the item are subject to change as we get more information and as we do a little bit more work on pulling the programs together.

03:55:17.765 --> 03:55:23.547
So as I mentioned, we will have opportunities for stakeholder engagement throughout these next few months.

03:55:24.207 --> 03:55:30.770
For this draft and for the January draft, we will be making available a toolkit for local use.

03:55:30.970 --> 03:55:42.114
One of the things we heard from stakeholders when we did phase one of stakeholder engagement is they thought it would be helpful if they had the tools available to do the engagement around the plan with or without CDE staff.

03:55:42.674 --> 03:55:45.235
So our toolkit will involve plan excerpt,

03:55:45.775 --> 03:55:53.664
a narrated PowerPoint about that section of the plan, and then some survey questions that are tied to that section so we can gather feedback.

03:55:54.144 --> 03:55:59.871
We'll do a webinar each time, letting people know that the toolkit is available and showing them how to use it.

03:56:01.112 --> 03:56:04.114
and we will bring that feedback with you throughout this process.

03:56:04.874 --> 03:56:21.565
In March, after we have a complete plan, we will again make the toolkit available, do all of those activities, but we will go out and do a full face-to-face push with the regional meetings that we did in phase one, so we have the opportunity to hear from people and talk through those questions in person.

03:56:25.695 --> 03:56:36.391
So last time we met I talked a little bit about ESSA providing states the opportunity to think big across programs and use resources to support the larger state vision.

03:56:38.414 --> 03:56:41.638
The plan is not, you know, we refer to this as braiding of funds.

03:56:42.579 --> 03:56:51.503
The plan in front of you right now doesn't really represent a lot of braiding because we don't really have enough information in here to really braid things together.

03:56:52.103 --> 03:56:58.686
Those of you who are familiar with braiding know that if you braid with just one section of hair, that's actually a ponytail.

03:57:01.358 --> 03:57:12.104
But I want to make it really clear for people who are concerned that we are not like putting one, two, three, and four and using these ideas more coherently and in a more holistic fashion right now.

03:57:12.684 --> 03:57:24.310
That is coming, it is our intent, and we're working very hard to figure out how to make this work, to as much as possible have integration across the programs, because we think that will probably result in better outcomes.

03:57:26.309 --> 03:57:46.283
And then another thing that we talked about last time when we talked about the strategic direction, I think it was member Holiday who said perhaps if we concentrate our efforts in a one direction instead of in eight directions or ten, depending on how many state priorities you're thinking about, we are likely to have more maximize our in our output.

03:57:47.063 --> 03:57:47.724
and our results.

03:57:48.324 --> 03:58:01.592
So building upon that board discussion in September, we've been in conversation with various stakeholders around how we might use ESSA resources to build the capacity of teachers and leaders to successfully implement state standards.

03:58:02.373 --> 03:58:06.195
Of course, implementation of standards is not a one-size-fits-all proposition.

03:58:06.855 --> 03:58:14.220
As we laid out in our state systemic improvement plan, we know that our students are multi-dimensional people with multi-dimensional needs,

03:58:15.618 --> 03:58:33.639
So given the equity focus nature of the ESSA, we propose to leverage ESSA resources to build the capacity of California educators to address the needs of these complex children that come to school every day and support the success of each of them as individuals to attain state standards.

03:58:34.540 --> 03:58:47.088
A memorandum that describes this emerging strategic direction and offers three of the models that were shared in attachment three of the September ESSA board item was posted to the CPAG October 13th agenda webpage.

03:58:48.009 --> 03:58:50.811
Thus far, feedback on the memo has been very positive.

03:58:51.591 --> 03:59:01.175
We plan to continue to share this memo with stakeholders over the coming months, and we'll bring more information to you on this topic in January for feedback and direction.

03:59:02.076 --> 03:59:11.840
Unless we hear differently from you between now and March, the complete March draft of the plan will reflect a focus on supporting the implementation of state standards.

03:59:13.901 --> 03:59:14.121
So,

03:59:15.310 --> 03:59:23.236
All of that said, this slide lists the elements included in the first draft of the ESSA State Plan, provided as attachment two of the item.

03:59:23.756 --> 03:59:25.137
Again, this is a first draft.

03:59:25.177 --> 03:59:38.087
We're not asking you to take action on this draft, but we are looking for your feedback and any inputs and thoughts, knowing that it is likely to change in small ways as we move towards that complete plan in March.

03:59:39.733 --> 03:59:55.268
Information on these plan elements was presented at the October 13th Joint CPAG State Board Study Session, and a number of my colleagues are here with me today ready to share information regarding the plan elements or respond to your questions.

03:59:55.949 --> 03:59:56.810
So I'm going to stop there.

03:59:56.850 --> 03:59:59.352
This is a much longer presentation, but

04:00:00.533 --> 04:00:03.394
We want to make sure we have enough time for your questions and comments.

04:00:03.814 --> 04:00:14.338
And if you have specific questions about specific programs, obviously our directors, I think they're probably half dozen behind me, are ready to help and perhaps do many presentations upon request.

04:00:16.458 --> 04:00:16.919
Okay.

04:00:17.979 --> 04:00:20.880
Ortiz Lacombe and then board member Williams.

04:00:23.756 --> 04:00:23.936
Hi.

04:00:25.078 --> 04:00:34.071
Can I ask a couple, we have this in thing about being from Southern California, so when I looked at you, I just, I remembered.

04:00:38.739 --> 04:00:41.382
I'm going to be very light with my questions here.

04:00:42.362 --> 04:00:46.086
So my question is more on the protocol of how we receive the feedback.

04:00:46.186 --> 04:01:05.843
So for example, there's so many elements to this plan, and when it's presented to different stakeholders, is it presented by their area of expertise, where the ELI work group would be commenting on Title III, and where others would be providing feedback on Title I.

04:01:07.524 --> 04:01:21.891
Again, because there's so many little pieces that we have to consider, I'm also concerned that if we wait until March to have discussions, and some of these discussions, really, if the regulations stay, some of them will stay as they are.

04:01:22.271 --> 04:01:28.735
I know that we want to table the conversation because there are draft regulations, but there are some regulations that I anticipate will still be

04:01:29.435 --> 04:01:34.600
in some form present some tension between what we have in California and what's being asked.

04:01:35.020 --> 04:01:49.413
And again, I'll go back to the example of this being a school-based or school-level accountability system where the California system is based on the LEAs, and this having a state-determined timeline where our LEA plan doesn't.

04:01:49.874 --> 04:01:50.815
So I don't,

04:01:51.395 --> 04:02:00.500
see how a system, a coherent system of accountability where the schools have to adhere by a timeline but not the LEAs, how that would work.

04:02:00.880 --> 04:02:10.265
And so I want to make sure that we do have sufficient time where as a board we're able to discuss what are those tensions or potential tensions and how do we resolve them.

04:02:12.046 --> 04:02:15.531
There's also some information that I didn't see here.

04:02:15.611 --> 04:02:17.012
We're doing a lot with the LPAC.

04:02:17.052 --> 04:02:20.076
We're doing a lot with our integrated frameworks.

04:02:21.137 --> 04:02:23.781
We do have a Spanish assessment that's under development.

04:02:24.221 --> 04:02:30.729
I didn't see that included here, so I'm wondering if that's coming later or if there was a reason for not including that at this point.

04:02:31.230 --> 04:02:31.490
Thank you.

04:02:35.925 --> 04:02:46.459
So I think we will actually bring to you in January some more information around our way forward with plan alignment.

04:02:47.000 --> 04:02:51.446
As you know, this is a sticky piece where how do we really make a single coherent system.

04:02:52.327 --> 04:02:56.832
where folks aren't doing one thing over here and another thing over here, but here are these expectations here and here.

04:02:57.212 --> 04:03:10.485
We've got to really map that puzzle out and put those pieces together and bring that to you for your consideration, and I am optimistic that that will happen in January, or the conversation around where we think we are, right?

04:03:11.386 --> 04:03:22.095
in January, we'll be able to share something about that with you to begin that conversation before March, where we're actually going to have to say this is what we think and put that out for public comment.

04:03:22.556 --> 04:03:31.864
Regarding the LPAC ELA ELD standards, one of our design principles, I think the assessment section and Michelle Center, who I think is behind me, will probably nod if that's true,

04:03:33.545 --> 04:03:36.987
Our standards and assessment section probably does talk about the LPAC.

04:03:37.027 --> 04:03:39.608
The last time I saw it, there was some conversation about it.

04:03:40.209 --> 04:03:47.993
At this point, things about standards, one of our plan design principles was to try and not go too far above and beyond what is requested.

04:03:48.013 --> 04:03:58.839
All right, so this draft plan is organized using the structure of the draft template, which is organized around the draft regs.

04:03:58.859 --> 04:04:00.720
You see how many times we're already in draft?

04:04:01.480 --> 04:04:14.931
But I was just speaking with someone about the challenging academic standards and assessment section doesn't really ask us to go into detail about tell us about your curriculum frameworks or how you plan to get there.

04:04:15.291 --> 04:04:16.952
At least in its current state, it doesn't.

04:04:17.573 --> 04:04:25.239
So if there are pieces missing, it's likely because the plan hasn't asked us to share about that.

04:04:28.461 --> 04:04:29.222
Board member Williams.

04:04:31.451 --> 04:04:43.431
I'm going to be interested in what we do with science and NGSS and the need to support professional development for teachers at each grade span with NGSS.

04:04:44.702 --> 04:04:55.851
And in addition, especially since my understanding is the Math and Science Partnerships opportunity we don't have anymore, and that was used pretty extensively by districts.

04:04:56.872 --> 04:05:01.516
So this is now the time when we're gonna pilot in 2017 the,

04:05:03.317 --> 04:05:07.901
in GSS state summative test and over the next four years roll that out.

04:05:07.962 --> 04:05:18.611
So if we don't put some investment into professional learning for our science, teachers of science, I mean this is the time that it becomes critical from here through there.

04:05:19.772 --> 04:05:33.638
So I'm gonna be interested in how we address that, because there are plenty of opportunities, as I see it, within ESSA for science in terms of it being part of a well-rounded education, 21st century education, all of that.

04:05:34.258 --> 04:05:45.143
In addition, even though this is newer, computer science is now explicitly mentioned in ESSA as part of STEM, a well-rounded education.

04:05:45.743 --> 04:05:59.330
And so we are just starting on what's going to be probably a two year process starting in early 2017 with AB 1539 and 2329 in terms of a strategic advisory body for computer science implementation in California and looking at

04:06:04.813 --> 04:06:07.335
the possibility of computer science standards.

04:06:07.775 --> 04:06:19.685
So since that's just now happening for California and it's just now in the federal law for the first time, then I'll be looking to see how we leverage ESSA for that as well as in GSS.

04:06:19.705 --> 04:06:21.386
Thank you.

04:06:22.587 --> 04:06:23.648
Okay, Board Member Strauss.

04:06:24.741 --> 04:06:32.790
So Barbara, I just want to thank you for taking us carefully along the path and for really incorporating lots of outreach and input from stakeholders.

04:06:33.251 --> 04:06:42.161
So I know we have a long way to go to get a fully coordinated plan, and I think what we're hearing through our state and our federal efforts, we really do want a coherent, coordinated plan.

04:06:42.661 --> 04:06:45.224
So I want to build on what Member Williams said and talk about

04:06:46.105 --> 04:06:53.993
the challenging state academic standards and academic assessments, and also the piece about supporting excellent educators.

04:06:54.033 --> 04:07:03.343
I think that's a really good opportunity, and we know from school district work that the benefits in using federal money to coordinate efforts in a local district can really make a difference.

04:07:04.004 --> 04:07:06.666
I think we really want to be clear

04:07:07.587 --> 04:07:16.011
that it should be in support of what we're already identifying through our LCAP process, and I think you're trying to be really clear about trying to coordinate it.

04:07:16.591 --> 04:07:23.735
But I think when we look at how to maximize the impact, the challenging state academic standards and academic assessments are really critical.

04:07:24.135 --> 04:07:32.339
And those of us who are working out in the field know that this is a long-term process, that we're early in our full implementation to touch all of our classrooms.

04:07:32.819 --> 04:07:43.246
So I'm really interested in, as you develop it, to take a look at building the capacity of teachers and leaders over time and incorporating English language development strategies.

04:07:43.326 --> 04:07:44.867
It's one of the things we're seeing in our framework.

04:07:44.907 --> 04:07:47.048
Those are embedded in all of our frameworks.

04:07:47.188 --> 04:07:50.450
It's going to be a connection across all of our schools.

04:07:50.830 --> 04:07:54.893
We're going to need to really address that to support the large percentage of students who need that.

04:07:55.493 --> 04:07:59.578
And that we need to support the leaders, both at the site and district level, to connect.

04:07:59.598 --> 04:08:06.006
Because what we're finding in our collaboration work is without working with leaders, it's not fully getting implemented.

04:08:06.067 --> 04:08:09.631
And so criteria that we would put in around

04:08:10.893 --> 04:08:22.328
multi-level, multi-year process, not a single, not a sit and get, not a information session, but how do we embed that in our implementation to meet these state requirements?

04:08:22.949 --> 04:08:27.295
So I think it's really important that we coordinate coherently to say,

04:08:27.295 --> 04:08:32.520
supplement and enhance what we're doing, and to maximize the flexibility for local districts.

04:08:32.580 --> 04:08:46.453
So again, I'm looking forward to, I appreciate you breaking into the parts for us, and so what I heard is that January, March, and May, we're gonna hear more and more information, and in between, CPAG will give feedback to you on the parts as well.

04:08:47.034 --> 04:08:47.334
Thank you.

04:08:50.387 --> 04:08:51.107
Board Member Sun.

04:08:51.608 --> 04:08:56.050
So just also want to reiterate a lot of what Member Stroud just talked about.

04:08:56.510 --> 04:09:09.197
I really appreciate the strategic approach overall in implementing the challenging academic standards and as we're talking about maybe the computer science standards or the LPAC or the language standards is

04:09:10.505 --> 04:09:14.327
How does that relate to that implementing of our state standards overall?

04:09:14.807 --> 04:09:29.074
And while I understand that we don't want to go into a lot more detail necessarily than what is being asked in our plan, that as we implement that plan, though, in California, we have an understanding that we're folding all of these pieces in.

04:09:29.694 --> 04:09:37.721
And as you're bringing the different pieces and parts back to us over the next few months, it would also be helpful then to tie it right back again.

04:09:37.821 --> 04:09:41.964
So this is one component, how does it tie back to that strategic plan?

04:09:42.725 --> 04:09:56.996
How will the different departments, divisions that have been in charge of titles, all the different titles, how will that work together in this new state plan that we will have?

04:10:01.185 --> 04:10:05.328
Okay, I'll ask a question and then board members may have some others.

04:10:06.129 --> 04:10:14.574
The frame of the application is helping schools and districts attain the high academic standards.

04:10:14.854 --> 04:10:19.157
And that's really what this is organized around.

04:10:19.417 --> 04:10:28.143
And we're taking an approach which has a large measure of building local capacity in order to do that.

04:10:31.606 --> 04:10:36.188
We're reexamining, for example, the application.

04:10:36.349 --> 04:10:39.891
We'll be reexamining the application process and criteria.

04:10:40.663 --> 04:10:45.824
for the overall plan and then for example, title one.

04:10:46.645 --> 04:10:55.367
So that brings me to the old local education agency plan, which was formulated in 2006.

04:10:57.628 --> 04:11:01.969
And I downloaded it, nearly broke my computer printer.

04:11:02.049 --> 04:11:04.150
I mean, it's huge.

04:11:04.650 --> 04:11:09.211
And I haven't had a chance to read it, but glancing through it,

04:11:09.975 --> 04:11:17.939
I mean, this is a real beast of a forum, and I just thank God I didn't have to fill that out, you know, in my whole life.

04:11:17.959 --> 04:11:25.403
You know, my impression superficially was I don't know what this has to do with what we're currently trying to do here.

04:11:25.803 --> 04:11:27.684
I don't see the thing as relevant at all.

04:11:27.724 --> 04:11:28.885
We have to start over.

04:11:29.505 --> 04:11:30.786
And how are you going to do that?

04:11:30.906 --> 04:11:32.507
I mean, what is what is the plan?

04:11:33.337 --> 04:11:40.505
you know, the group to do that, because you can't just adapt something from NCLB for this.

04:11:40.665 --> 04:11:42.867
So we're really starting de novo.

04:11:43.928 --> 04:11:50.896
And was the local education plan on 206, was that the bulk of the application for Title I in those days?

04:11:51.056 --> 04:11:53.619
And that was the key thing you looked at?

04:11:54.542 --> 04:12:05.485
Right, so we are not intending to build the new LEA plan based on, our new LEA plan for ESSA starting with the old NCLB plan.

04:12:06.126 --> 04:12:17.009
There are specific provisions outlined in the law that districts need to address, and there are about 35 of them that start with describe how you're doing this, describe how you're doing this.

04:12:17.049 --> 04:12:23.451
And then there's a separate set of things that we ask districts to do regularly, provide assurances.

04:12:23.991 --> 04:12:28.196
So the assurances can all go into the consolidated application reporting system.

04:12:28.236 --> 04:12:29.638
That's relatively easy.

04:12:30.139 --> 04:12:34.444
What we're working with now is how are we going to

04:12:36.294 --> 04:12:41.378
We already have LCAPs which ask districts to explain what they're doing in some detail.

04:12:42.078 --> 04:12:49.463
There's some concern that what ESSA asks districts to explain is a little more detailed than what LCAPs do.

04:12:49.884 --> 04:13:03.173
So our charge, and you're asking what are we doing over Christmas vacation, because I just said I was gonna try and bring you some preliminary thinking in January, is to try and figure out how we can streamline that planning process.

04:13:04.054 --> 04:13:05.294
LCAP is where we start.

04:13:06.275 --> 04:13:12.460
What do we need to do to address those LEA plan provisions across Titles 1, 2, 3, and 4?

04:13:13.180 --> 04:13:16.663
Can some of them go into the consolidated application process?

04:13:17.083 --> 04:13:20.005
Can some of them be covered through the LCAP process?

04:13:20.065 --> 04:13:27.011
These are the questions that we're asking and trying to resolve to at least bring you some preliminary thinking about that in January.

04:13:27.491 --> 04:13:34.956
Obviously, another piece of this, I had the pleasure of presenting at CASFEP, our state and federal program directors back on October 13th,

04:13:36.077 --> 04:13:40.801
These are folks who actually build LCAPs and LEA plans, right?

04:13:40.841 --> 04:13:45.985
So I use them, I didn't warn them in advance, and I apologize to all of you now, as a bit of a focus group.

04:13:46.803 --> 04:13:56.890
You know, because I think everyone is very much desirous of streamlining this planning process and having a single planning process that makes sense, right?

04:13:57.070 --> 04:14:01.273
We don't want one over here and one over there, and they're certainly invested in that as well.

04:14:01.734 --> 04:14:11.420
And they have experience with both of these planning efforts, so I'm trying to use as much district input as possible to make sure that whatever we come up with makes sense.

04:14:12.461 --> 04:14:13.962
And yeah, we'll get that together.

04:14:14.062 --> 04:14:15.782
Okay, well, I'll use this opportunity.

04:14:15.822 --> 04:14:18.923
This pertains to the federal aid.

04:14:19.444 --> 04:14:34.009
Since we met in September, I would do what normally would be done in a state priorities discussion we're going to have later, but this was focused on Title I. So the Gates Foundation and Achieve called a conference in Palm Springs, California,

04:14:35.001 --> 04:14:44.788
of several states, including California, to focus on thinking about the new federal aid initiative.

04:14:45.288 --> 04:14:46.529
And I saw a report out.

04:14:46.930 --> 04:14:48.971
Many people from California attended.

04:14:49.251 --> 04:14:49.792
I attended.

04:14:49.872 --> 04:14:50.953
Glenn Price attended.

04:14:52.133 --> 04:14:54.974
Robert Linquani of WestEd attended.

04:14:55.094 --> 04:14:56.635
Janelle Kubinek attended.

04:14:57.755 --> 04:15:00.656
Mike Hanson, superintendent of Fresno, attended.

04:15:01.197 --> 04:15:04.578
Mike Smith attended, formerly of the US Department.

04:15:04.738 --> 04:15:07.139
Jennifer O'Day of AIR attended.

04:15:08.099 --> 04:15:15.482
A person from the Carnegie Foundation for Improvement at Stanford attended.

04:15:17.243 --> 04:15:20.024
And it was run by Achieve, Mike Cohen of Achieve.

04:15:21.150 --> 04:15:24.275
And it focused on what was called at the meeting.

04:15:25.094 --> 04:15:39.037
the front end of ESSA rather than the back end, which is so much discussed about in terms of the accountability provisions that tie into all the discussion we have at accountability.

04:15:39.777 --> 04:15:43.078
The topic of this was, let's not talk about that much here.

04:15:43.558 --> 04:15:51.680
Let's talk about which instruments you have to use federally to improve the system on the front end and what is the front end.

04:15:52.280 --> 04:15:54.562
The front end is the LEA applications.

04:15:54.802 --> 04:15:57.725
All of these applications are now defunct.

04:15:58.085 --> 04:16:04.691
They have to apply, they the locals, to the State Education Agency for approval for all funds.

04:16:05.652 --> 04:16:14.235
So you can improve the quality of things not just by hammering at the back end of accountability, but improving the front end of what the applications are.

04:16:14.715 --> 04:16:21.357
And from what I saw, that LEA plan is an example of how you don't do it, and we're seeking a way to do it.

04:16:25.743 --> 04:16:34.628
Another instrument you have are the reporting reports, if the board wants to be active.

04:16:35.468 --> 04:16:46.534
For Title I, and you list them here in Title III, we receive annual reports under these federal aid and we could look at these reports and say,

04:16:47.714 --> 04:16:49.295
you're not doing well enough.

04:16:50.316 --> 04:16:56.181
So we would like to talk with you about before, you know, we approve the next batch of funds, what you can do.

04:16:56.801 --> 04:16:58.963
So that was also discussed there.

04:17:00.104 --> 04:17:07.330
So and then, of course, a third angle was building local capacity, and that is included in the

04:17:08.310 --> 04:17:17.338
in the draft that Barbara sent around to the board members that's been released after CPAG on what are called the state set-aside funds.

04:17:18.399 --> 04:17:23.723
If we set aside everything we could set aside under the law, it'd be between $150 and $200 million.

04:17:26.383 --> 04:17:27.243
at the state level.

04:17:27.303 --> 04:17:28.664
I mean, that's a high-popping number.

04:17:29.544 --> 04:17:35.646
We must withhold 7% of Title I. That is $128 million.

04:17:36.366 --> 04:17:40.847
Now we have to re-grant that amount, but we could run competitive grants.

04:17:42.028 --> 04:17:43.648
We could do a whole number of things.

04:17:43.708 --> 04:17:46.469
So we can withhold 3% of Title III.

04:17:46.489 --> 04:17:47.429
That's about $6 to $7 million.

04:17:54.371 --> 04:18:06.358
So the general view of the conference was to not think about this title by title.

04:18:08.003 --> 04:18:29.621
That means you probably wouldn't organize your state education agency, title by title, to administer this, to focus on what is really the big thing in the plan, which is a big thing in the law, which is students attaining the state high academic standards.

04:18:29.681 --> 04:18:34.365
And we sure have those in all four subject areas now.

04:18:36.073 --> 04:18:38.714
So how would you do that?

04:18:38.994 --> 04:18:44.796
And so how do you then frame an application in a federal strategy to do that?

04:18:45.756 --> 04:18:53.379
While there are a lot of federal restrictions on the back end, what I'm calling back end accountability, there are very few on the front end.

04:18:53.779 --> 04:18:57.200
That's really where the flexibility is in many ways.

04:18:58.241 --> 04:19:01.642
And so we have a lot of authority to

04:19:02.482 --> 04:19:16.540
set up the application, to approve set up criteria for approval of local applications, and how we think about those applications from localities in terms of meeting the highest state academic standards.

04:19:17.261 --> 04:19:19.444
So this was more of a

04:19:20.665 --> 04:19:28.789
It was sort of around a conference around if states really wanted to exercise leverage on the front end of it, how would they do that?

04:19:28.889 --> 04:19:30.569
What are the restrictions in the law?

04:19:30.769 --> 04:19:31.350
Very few.

04:19:31.370 --> 04:19:36.132
So we just have a lot of design things to think about.

04:19:36.912 --> 04:19:49.957
which is very different than the discussion which was carried on in the letter we sent to the federal regulations, which was basically about the back end of accountability, because we had no objections with the regulations in the front end.

04:19:50.477 --> 04:19:56.199
So that's sort of the conclusion of the conference in that regard.

04:19:56.579 --> 04:19:58.440
We had an exercise, I guess,

04:20:04.262 --> 04:20:08.046
and that each state would suggest that the group would work on.

04:20:08.086 --> 04:20:09.267
And I hadn't been primed on this.

04:20:09.587 --> 04:20:19.656
Right out of the top of my head, I don't know why, I said, what I want to work on for California is what's causing the big difference between English language arts and mathematics?

04:20:20.457 --> 04:20:22.919
This is, you know, on our Smarter Balanced assessments.

04:20:23.599 --> 04:20:26.222
And the other states chimed in and said, we didn't have it.

04:20:27.725 --> 04:20:28.546
Why do we have it?

04:20:29.767 --> 04:20:30.308
I don't know.

04:20:31.929 --> 04:20:43.440
So, you know, we got to talking about that in an intense way, and I won't dwell on the conversation, but it was pretty interesting from that standpoint.

04:20:43.480 --> 04:20:48.505
So there's my report on this Gates conference.

04:20:49.646 --> 04:20:54.347
and some of the thinking, and what I reflected was what came out of the conference.

04:20:55.588 --> 04:21:04.770
Glenn and Barbara are aware of that, and their thinking has been generally along the lines of the conference outcomes.

04:21:04.790 --> 04:21:08.211
I don't know whether, Glenn, you want to add anything to this.

04:21:08.711 --> 04:21:11.132
You were there, and if you care to.

04:21:18.706 --> 04:21:22.587
I think President Coors, you described it in broad terms really well.

04:21:22.867 --> 04:21:38.673
I think one of the take-home messages for me was, we've been talking a lot about this integration and braiding that Barbara has put forward, but really bringing that down to a concrete possibility, and I would suggest that,

04:21:39.653 --> 04:21:45.434
and others that are interested, take a look at that memo that's posted on the October 13th CPAG site.

04:21:46.035 --> 04:22:05.979
It's kind of the next step in our thinking coming out of the conference in Palm Springs where we kind of sat down and said, okay, if we're looking at this front end, what would be the best way for us to be thinking about utilizing and investing these resources to be building the kind of capacity that we need to see to implement the standards in the way that we'd like to in California

04:22:06.759 --> 04:22:29.875
The three items that are listed out there address building out our regional support resources to something we've been calling the California Support Network, to be thinking about bringing back some of the kinds of infrastructure that we've had in the past in California around capacity building for educators, which were reframed in that memo as the California Leadership Initiative.

04:22:29.915 --> 04:22:36.079
And then lastly, how can we be looking at and providing the best possible resources for standards implementation.

04:22:36.999 --> 04:22:54.827
It's fleshed out in conceptual form in that memo, and so it takes this thinking about this overarching priority of standards, which has been something that we've all obviously been committed to for a bit now, and makes it concrete in terms of how could we be thinking about this in terms of this opportunity that we have in front of us.

04:22:55.407 --> 04:23:03.091
So that was some of the momentum building out of that meeting kind of jettisoned us into some of that thinking.

04:23:03.491 --> 04:23:11.894
and the board members got that CPAG memo, which was the department's first cut at thinking about this.

04:23:11.994 --> 04:23:14.375
Not definitive comments, very welcome.

04:23:14.895 --> 04:23:28.400
The department stressed this was just to illustrate and demonstrate some initial thoughts about this, but the board will have these state set-aside decisions in front of it.

04:23:30.709 --> 04:23:34.740
I think that pose some some alternatives that are quite reasonable for the discussion.

04:23:36.505 --> 04:23:37.467
Board member Rucker.

04:23:39.380 --> 04:23:49.768
Well, Barbara, first of all, I want to thank you for what I know has been a lot of work among multiple divisions in the department to start putting together this draft.

04:23:50.549 --> 04:24:05.721
And I have to also say I appreciate that since ESSA was signed into law last year, the multiple times that you have come to the board meetings to give us an update about what the department is doing and what it is you're looking at,

04:24:06.181 --> 04:24:07.602
and what it is you're thinking about.

04:24:07.662 --> 04:24:31.756
And so when I got the draft plan and I read it, what I was hoping, as board member Lacombe pointed out, that this would be the opportunity for the board to start talking about in the totality of all the decisions we have made and the decisions that are still under development and decisions that have to wait until the regulations are done, you know, have we as a board actually

04:24:32.316 --> 04:24:39.938
given to the department what we believe our priority should be or what we think the frame of the plan should be.

04:24:39.998 --> 04:24:46.799
And I have to tell you, unless I've missed a meeting, I'm not sure we've had that conversation.

04:24:47.219 --> 04:24:54.381
Because in reading all the five different parts of the plan, I heard five different purposes.

04:24:54.441 --> 04:24:56.201
I read five different voices.

04:24:57.202 --> 04:24:59.444
Is this supposed to be a spending plan?

04:24:59.844 --> 04:25:11.915
So I've heard people talk about braiding or blending the funds, and so is the plan in some way going to give a narrative about how the state is going to use all of these different funds?

04:25:11.935 --> 04:25:16.660
That's not a conversation we've had in this meeting, and again, unless I've missed a meeting.

04:25:17.220 --> 04:25:23.886
The second thing I've read very clearly in the plan was about this notion of capacity building.

04:25:23.926 --> 04:25:30.431
That's the conversation in all the memos we've received and all the information items and briefings we've received.

04:25:30.831 --> 04:25:43.802
The focus of my attention has been on this capacity building piece with the goal of figuring out how to create this single, coherent, and uniform accountability system

04:25:44.202 --> 04:25:53.824
how we're going to blend those elements together, but also what it means to build the capacity for the local education agencies to do that.

04:25:54.745 --> 04:26:00.126
Having that part of the conversation, we've only focused in one area, on the accountability.

04:26:00.146 --> 04:26:07.247
So that's the third voice I heard, and that was probably, for me, the strongest part of the plan, because there were some things we have definitively done.

04:26:07.608 --> 04:26:13.229
Those are conversations we have definitively had engagement on and done a lot of work on.

04:26:13.809 --> 04:26:20.294
But some of these other pieces are still missing, and I'll tell you where the balance wasn't for me.

04:26:20.894 --> 04:26:41.449
In Title IV, in talking about the 21st century learning communities, as Dr. Kearse pointed out, there's both funding requirements and some program-level requirements, but there are also some things that districts have some flexibility to develop in their own local education plans.

04:26:41.989 --> 04:26:51.272
And so the local, the LEA plans, the local plans, there's 13 activities and seven assurances that have to be addressed in their plans.

04:26:52.052 --> 04:26:57.014
I was hoping that there would be some overlap in developing, for example, in Title IV,

04:26:57.754 --> 04:27:20.682
some guidance or some things that we would be guiding districts to consider or to understand so that there would be some consonance between what the state priorities are and hopefully that would inform and guide districts in the development of their LEA plans, knowing that we have to write or help develop or consider developing a new template for writing that LEA plan.

04:27:20.702 --> 04:27:21.742
So that's one voice

04:27:22.222 --> 04:27:25.684
or one idea in developing the plan that I didn't hear.

04:27:26.164 --> 04:27:43.073
The last piece is not only are there the state formula grants that have to be addressed, and that's what the bulk of the plan really requires the state, as a state plan, to look at, but there are also a number of different competitive grants

04:27:43.613 --> 04:27:52.037
that also either the state can apply for or LEAs can apply for, and that informs some of the other work that is done.

04:27:52.417 --> 04:28:01.241
For example, in Title II Part A, I'm very clear that those are formula grants that come to the state, that the LEAs are going to apply to the state and receive,

04:28:01.761 --> 04:28:06.344
We're going to have some idea in writing that plan what it is we're asking them to do.

04:28:06.404 --> 04:28:16.489
And I've heard already from some of my colleagues on the board, we want the professional development money out of Title II Part A to focus on these things.

04:28:17.449 --> 04:28:28.057
In Title II, Part B, there are all of those multiple types of grants that consortiums of districts or the state, even in collaboration with districts, can also apply for.

04:28:28.617 --> 04:28:37.563
I'm not clear that we're looking at those competitive grants or having an idea, casting an idea about looking at those competitive grants as well.

04:28:37.603 --> 04:28:43.987
So I'm not sure I read that, and it could be something I missed in looking at some of these other parts.

04:28:44.027 --> 04:28:46.429
So that's something I'm hoping would come through.

04:28:48.170 --> 04:29:01.116
in looking, and then finally, the last piece that I wanted to talk about is, at some point, as you've said, you're going to get this feedback from stakeholders, and you all are gonna have some process for vetting that feedback.

04:29:01.616 --> 04:29:12.681
What I didn't hear, and what was missing for me is, so when do I get to say something, or when do I get to add some feedback, or are you telling me I'm supposed to go to the portal and add my feedback there?

04:29:12.721 --> 04:29:14.642
I think that there has to be,

04:29:15.322 --> 04:29:30.849
Yeah, so I'm thinking there has to be, because I went to the CPAG meeting and I really enjoyed listening to that and I learned a lot, but I haven't figured out yet, and it's not clear to me yet, when is my work or when is the work of my colleagues here

04:29:31.389 --> 04:29:34.734
supposed to inform what's being written into the draft.

04:29:34.754 --> 04:29:48.253
So, as I said, particularly with Title I, I see where some of that work is, but in some of these other titles, I don't see where our conversations have actually informed what's in the draft narrative right now.

04:29:48.613 --> 04:30:03.458
And I don't mean that as a criticism, I really mean it more, I think we need to look at the step we're missing in our own process because we haven't had that conversation as it relates to framing what the board's priorities would be in being written into the state plan.

04:30:03.859 --> 04:30:04.919
I hope that makes sense.

04:30:05.299 --> 04:30:14.210
It absolutely makes sense, and I think you've just clearly articulated the danger of bringing one chunk of information without all of the chunks of information.

04:30:14.651 --> 04:30:20.178
Yet I still am really reluctant to bring 300 pages of state plan to you in March.

04:30:20.698 --> 04:30:32.112
Right, so part of this, I think we talked about the Title II-B grants back in May and that they were available and we intended to apply for them as soon as we had more information about them because there are a lot of opportunities.

04:30:32.592 --> 04:30:34.535
The STEM Master Teacher Corps is in there.

04:30:34.575 --> 04:30:37.058
We're hoping that that can begin to fill the shoes of

04:30:37.618 --> 04:30:43.401
the math and science partnership grants, there's the literacy for all, results for the nation grant, there are all kinds of grants.

04:30:43.461 --> 04:30:53.925
And I think I signaled, we don't have clear information about these, they haven't been funded, the RFAs haven't gone out, but we intend to keep an eye on them and apply for them as soon as more information is available.

04:30:54.005 --> 04:31:05.670
Okay, so what I guess I'm suggesting is that in writing out and developing, because the state plan asks you to identify what the state is doing to create this well-rounded education.

04:31:06.090 --> 04:31:21.685
And so while this is both supposed to be a plan for developing capacity and a spending plan, I think that the work on explaining what our state's plans are for developing and implementing a well-rounded education

04:31:22.305 --> 04:31:30.131
should be developed irregardless of whether we're figuring out if we're going to apply for any of those Part B programs.

04:31:30.171 --> 04:31:33.934
Because we know we're going to be doing work to write a new state assessment in science.

04:31:34.335 --> 04:31:39.399
We know we want to have this statewide plan for doing a rollout on professional development.

04:31:39.419 --> 04:31:41.861
So it needs to be written in there and developed.

04:31:43.123 --> 04:31:50.587
Okay, so now I'm channeling my parents, and I'm going to say, you need to just go ahead and figure out the plan, and we can figure out how to pay for it later.

04:31:50.607 --> 04:31:58.832
That's not quite what I mean, but I do mean I don't want this to be, I'm hoping we're not, we're writing a narrative about building capacity.

04:31:59.372 --> 04:32:07.318
and in some way figuring out how to braid in the conversation about the funding and about the other elements because I think that that's the part that was missing.

04:32:07.699 --> 04:32:18.187
I'm not seeing in the development of what's there right now that full attention to building the capacity and building out that well-rounded education.

04:32:18.227 --> 04:32:21.950
I'm not sure in all of those four or five parts right now it's in there.

04:32:22.170 --> 04:32:25.332
It is not very well articulated in these five parts.

04:32:25.832 --> 04:32:41.019
We anticipate, we are confident that we will be bringing to you in the January item our supporting excellent educators section, or at least as much of it as we can in the absence of regs, and we also still have the supporting all schools, supporting all students section.

04:32:41.119 --> 04:32:47.022
So those sections, because they are a little more complicated and benefit from this kind of conversation about well how

04:32:47.162 --> 04:32:48.842
do we want to support all educators?

04:32:49.243 --> 04:32:51.483
Do we want to focus on implementation of standards?

04:32:51.903 --> 04:32:55.444
Do we want to use that 3% allowable set aside in Title II?

04:32:55.864 --> 04:33:01.646
How are we going to be supporting the schools that are identified for comprehensive and targeted supports?

04:33:02.086 --> 04:33:04.306
Those are conversations that we need to have with you.

04:33:04.707 --> 04:33:09.108
That's why we're sort of deferring a lot of that till the latest possible minute, which is March.

04:33:09.968 --> 04:33:14.109
But the conversation we're having now in terms of like when you all provide feedback,

04:33:15.151 --> 04:33:25.936
Every time I'm standing up here, I am taking your conversation as feedback, and that helps us to move forward with what we've got so far.

04:33:26.277 --> 04:33:35.161
Okay, so if that's the case, then I'm going to give you the three little words, career technical education.

04:33:35.801 --> 04:33:44.925
So I think there's an opportunity in title four to think about how to make sure that that remains a priority and gets the attention in a statewide focus.

04:33:45.565 --> 04:33:47.866
I think this is our opportunity to make sure that that happens.

04:33:47.886 --> 04:33:54.409
So I will say that there and figure out how to give some how to write that out or give you some information on that later.

04:33:54.629 --> 04:33:55.669
So I'll just say it that way.

04:33:56.009 --> 04:33:56.730
I appreciate it.

04:34:00.371 --> 04:34:00.991
Other comments?

04:34:01.151 --> 04:34:02.412
Board member Ortiz will comment.

04:34:05.114 --> 04:34:17.441
I appreciate your comments, Board Member Rucker, because I also had some questions about just the protocol, and I was trying to get at, I didn't have coffee, though, I was trying to get at, at what point are we also part of that conversation?

04:34:17.881 --> 04:34:27.427
So in looking at Title III, the last time there was the use of RFEP students in the EL subgroup, and there was some pushback on that.

04:34:27.867 --> 04:34:30.749
I'm looking at the reclassification criteria right now,

04:34:31.289 --> 04:34:37.073
And I know that we are waiting to see how the LPAC, once upon implementation, to determine the cut scores.

04:34:37.593 --> 04:34:39.675
And so for me, it's still a little unclear.

04:34:40.155 --> 04:34:48.961
Are we saying that once we remove the SBAC outcomes from the criteria, that that is the reclassification criteria that we want?

04:34:49.501 --> 04:34:53.705
and that we're going to wait for the LPAC implementation to determine the cut scores.

04:34:54.927 --> 04:35:07.980
I don't know what we're saying based on the item because it lists what we're currently doing, but are we also then saying that those three criteria points are good enough for us to consider our reclassification criteria?

04:35:08.460 --> 04:35:09.601
Well, I'm asking.

04:35:10.362 --> 04:35:11.703
I don't know if that's what it said.

04:35:11.843 --> 04:35:17.087
And I'm wondering who made that decision, if that's what we're saying, who has input.

04:35:17.127 --> 04:35:19.168
And that's what we currently have in place.

04:35:19.228 --> 04:35:29.196
But again, I'll reiterate the point that what we have in place has not been a standard program or a standard practice of reclassifying students.

04:35:29.276 --> 04:35:30.557
It really varies by district.

04:35:30.817 --> 04:35:31.517
So why would we?

04:35:32.578 --> 04:35:37.480
establish that as our criteria to reclassified if the goal is to make it standard across the state.

04:35:38.040 --> 04:35:41.242
And I'm sure that there's other folks that could really weigh in.

04:35:41.682 --> 04:35:56.148
So just understanding what is it that we're proposing, for me there, because it outlines the criteria that we currently have, I'm not sure if we're saying that that's what we want to go with, and if that is what we want to go with, then that merits a discussion.

04:35:56.968 --> 04:35:57.989
Well, fortunately,

04:35:59.013 --> 04:35:59.774
if she's still here.

04:36:00.114 --> 04:36:18.896
Veronica Aguilar, Director of our English Learner Support Division is here, and she can talk about the specific elements in those sections of the plan, but I think this is a good example of those concerns were raised in September, and we took those concerns and said we're going to look at this more closely with our English Learner Indicator Workgroup.

04:36:19.096 --> 04:36:19.316
Right?

04:36:19.376 --> 04:36:26.538
So when we hear concerns and feedback from you all and from the public, we actually try and move that concern forward.

04:36:27.079 --> 04:36:34.741
But if you want more information about what we're doing in terms of the reclassification, Veronica is certainly here and can come talk about that for a minute.

04:36:38.968 --> 04:36:46.333
So I think I want to reiterate, good morning, members of the board and Superintendent Torlakson and President Kerst.

04:36:48.474 --> 04:36:54.198
The portion of Title III, it's actually addressing just the entry and exit criteria.

04:36:55.078 --> 04:37:05.542
And for us to, we have to state to the federal government, how does California currently have a standard process for entry and exit criteria?

04:37:05.922 --> 04:37:10.064
So what you see there is our process currently in place, which is an indication code.

04:37:10.704 --> 04:37:13.566
And the Education Code currently does have four areas.

04:37:14.007 --> 04:37:22.973
It includes the Language Proficiency Assessment, which currently is the CELT, teacher input, parent input, and then academic achievement.

04:37:23.293 --> 04:37:27.656
Now ESSA calls only for the English Language Proficiency Assessment.

04:37:28.057 --> 04:37:29.178
That's what ESSA calls for.

04:37:30.158 --> 04:37:34.982
So the regulations, if they pass, that's what we would have to comply with.

04:37:36.525 --> 04:37:47.009
So the statement there is that we're starting conversations with you and the legislature as to what should that criteria be for the exit.

04:37:47.189 --> 04:37:48.730
For the entry, I think it's very clear.

04:37:49.050 --> 04:37:52.692
The LPAC already is going to address that with the screener.

04:37:53.132 --> 04:37:57.974
So once we have this LPAC in place in 2018, the entry is done.

04:37:58.274 --> 04:38:00.715
The exit is where we have to have those conversations.

04:38:01.135 --> 04:38:06.700
And I think the item for the federal government, we have to say we're looking into it and we will address it.

04:38:06.920 --> 04:38:16.669
And the statement right now, it talks about the fact that once the LPAC is in place and we have the cut score, we would have the ability to move in that direction.

04:38:17.029 --> 04:38:26.117
Now whether or not we continue to include teacher evaluation and parent input, I think that's up to, of course, the decision that is made.

04:38:26.597 --> 04:38:29.480
But it's the conversation that we need to have.

04:38:32.796 --> 04:38:34.297
So that's what I was trying to get at.

04:38:34.397 --> 04:38:38.259
Is this a conversation that's pending and we're just reporting on what we currently do?

04:38:38.879 --> 04:38:46.743
And how do people from the ELA working group, what are their thoughts on the reclassification process?

04:38:47.123 --> 04:38:54.247
Do they feel that having the proficiency rate and the LPAC, the student teacher recommendation and parent input, is that sufficient?

04:38:54.307 --> 04:38:56.848
Will that guarantee some standard process across the state?

04:38:58.410 --> 04:38:59.671
Have those conversations happened?

04:39:00.031 --> 04:39:01.331
There's a few conversations.

04:39:01.351 --> 04:39:09.794
I mean, reclassification for those members that have been on board for a while, reclassification has been a topic of discussion for many, many years.

04:39:10.875 --> 04:39:14.536
Ed code has not changed, though, even though those discussions have occurred.

04:39:15.896 --> 04:39:17.377
What we're seeing with ESSA, it's giving us

04:39:18.677 --> 04:39:25.958
if the regulations pass, as they are, we are definitely going to have to remove the academic performance, item four.

04:39:26.399 --> 04:39:40.781
The other two items, the teacher evaluation and parent opinion, it's really up to the state, because we would have to actually push back to the federal government, saying that we think multiple measures are needed.

04:39:41.061 --> 04:39:45.542
The federal government is saying one measure, which is the language proficiency assessment.

04:39:53.556 --> 04:39:54.377
reclassification.

04:39:54.397 --> 04:40:00.143
So we have what's in the Education Code concerning the four criteria for reclassification.

04:40:00.183 --> 04:40:03.146
We also have some things in our state regulations.

04:40:03.307 --> 04:40:11.896
If the federal regulations as proposed remain unchanged, are there going to have to be any changes in our statute or in our Title V regulations?

04:40:13.012 --> 04:40:25.489
Are you anticipating, can you identify what those, okay I don't mean to put you on the spot, can you identify what those would be aside from, I know the academic piece would have to change, are there other things that would have to change also?

04:40:28.513 --> 04:40:32.454
The reclassification, that's the only section, that's why it's mentioned.

04:40:32.814 --> 04:40:43.958
Okay, so of the four criteria, we know that the fourth one would have to come out, and that would take a change both in our regulations and in the, and it would take a legislative change as well.

04:40:44.078 --> 04:40:44.238
Yes.

04:40:45.599 --> 04:40:46.019
Okay.

04:40:48.160 --> 04:40:48.480
Thank you.

04:40:50.861 --> 04:40:54.382
Okay, other comments on this, yeah.

04:40:57.379 --> 04:41:00.180
Okay, we'll take some, pardon?

04:41:00.680 --> 04:41:04.401
All right, we'll take some public comment.

04:41:07.382 --> 04:41:09.343
Would the following speakers please line up?

04:41:09.603 --> 04:41:16.645
Doug McRae, Brian Rivas, Martha Zaragoza-Diaz, Sandy Mendoza, Eric Premack, and Terry Burns.

04:41:23.667 --> 04:41:24.527
And Jessica Sacco.

04:41:26.897 --> 04:41:31.100
Good afternoon, Martha Zaragoza-Diaz representing CABE and Californians Together.

04:41:31.941 --> 04:41:39.627
And I'm very, very concerned about the fact that we would be deleting that fourth criteria from the reclassification.

04:41:41.349 --> 04:41:52.337
Court case and law states that we need to know whether English learners are acquiring academic content while they are becoming proficient in English.

04:41:53.038 --> 04:41:55.260
And we don't know what the LPAC is gonna look like.

04:41:56.120 --> 04:41:59.843
We don't know if that assessment is gonna be able to measure that.

04:42:00.103 --> 04:42:16.135
So I would recommend that this be more thoroughly vetted with other stakeholders, especially the EL community, in order to really think through what the long-term consequences are gonna be by eliminating this fourth criteria.

04:42:16.655 --> 04:42:17.936
So that's one comment.

04:42:18.076 --> 04:42:19.097
The other comment is,

04:42:20.037 --> 04:42:28.624
We would like to have included in the state plan at least a narrative in reference to the language arts assessment in Spanish.

04:42:29.505 --> 04:42:35.129
We're having this assessment for students who are being instructed in a language other than English.

04:42:35.509 --> 04:42:38.431
Why not state that in the state plan?

04:42:38.872 --> 04:42:39.152
Thank you.

04:42:45.187 --> 04:42:45.788
Good afternoon.

04:42:45.848 --> 04:42:48.711
I'm Doug McRae, a retired educational measurement specialist.

04:42:49.611 --> 04:42:55.557
I'm going to talk about the draft plan for academic standards and statewide assessments only.

04:42:56.318 --> 04:43:03.945
For academic standards, there's only a single sentence in the current draft material that says that material is in the peer review material.

04:43:04.145 --> 04:43:07.528
Well, peer review materials are not available to the general public.

04:43:08.537 --> 04:43:10.998
And that's a problem for your upcoming public comment period.

04:43:11.999 --> 04:43:19.342
Also, the peer review material does not cover actual implementation of Common Core standards in California since adoption in 2010.

04:43:20.242 --> 04:43:26.805
For the assessments, I have about 10 detailed comments I'll likely submit in writing during the upcoming public comment period.

04:43:27.565 --> 04:43:38.793
Most of those comments involve descriptions that reflect marketing promises for the assessment program features rather than statements of actual implemented features that address ESSA requirements.

04:43:40.294 --> 04:43:40.574
Thank you.

04:43:46.946 --> 04:43:50.827
Mr. President, I'm Brian Rivas speaking on behalf of the Education Trust West.

04:43:51.808 --> 04:44:11.174
And a couple of comments for you first is, so as you turn to your work on accountability under ESSA, and you're gonna be talking about school accountability related to schools, we would ask that you give some thought to doing some focused, deliberate outreach to parents and communities.

04:44:11.814 --> 04:44:13.695
This is really where the rubber hits the road,

04:44:14.535 --> 04:44:32.359
And I worry a little bit that unless you do some firsthand information gathering, focus group work, you're gonna be left to sort out what we advocates argue parents want, or what the interpretation that advocates give you trying to support their respective positions.

04:44:32.899 --> 04:44:42.461
I think the debate could benefit from some firsthand information from real parents when you talk about school ratings, what information is available and how it's presented.

04:44:43.816 --> 04:44:55.762
Secondly, we don't know what the final regs will say, but when you get to that point on differentiation, please keep in mind that multiple measures and a summary rating don't have to be mutually exclusive.

04:44:56.263 --> 04:44:58.684
Other states are looking at different ways to incorporate both.

04:45:03.075 --> 04:45:04.736
Eric Premack, Charter Schools Development Center.

04:45:05.336 --> 04:45:08.037
Two things with respect to charter schools in the state plan.

04:45:08.097 --> 04:45:11.098
First off, we asked to what we call do no harm.

04:45:11.658 --> 04:45:17.500
We've had some long simmering issues over how charter schools fit into the current state plan that evolved since 2002.

04:45:19.761 --> 04:45:28.732
over teacher credentialing issues, over whether you use this template or that template or that template for the LEA plan and so on and so forth.

04:45:28.792 --> 04:45:38.343
Those continue to be unresolved currently and we don't want to have that happen all over again with this plan and see it as an opportunity to try to fix those.

04:45:39.263 --> 04:45:52.106
Second, with respect to funding, you're not talking about that a lot yet today, but it did come up in the practitioner's advisory group with a lot of talk about recreating the school leadership academies or taking money off the top to do this, that, and the other thing.

04:45:52.766 --> 04:45:57.287
As a general rule, we like to see local control over those funds.

04:45:58.028 --> 04:46:07.130
We often find that these state-level initiatives may work for some districts, but often don't work for others or for charter schools, and we want to maximize local control.

04:46:07.310 --> 04:46:07.570
Thank you.

04:46:12.830 --> 04:46:15.772
Good afternoon President Kerr, Superintendent Torlakson, members of the board.

04:46:15.812 --> 04:46:19.294
My name is Jessica Sacco representing the California Science Teachers Association.

04:46:19.774 --> 04:46:25.038
I'm really grateful for the opportunity to be here today as well as to hear your discussion that took place earlier.

04:46:25.058 --> 04:46:32.783
We're really pleased to hear about the current direction to support the implementation of state standards that the state is currently proposing.

04:46:33.944 --> 04:46:44.154
The letter that we submitted does outline several opportunities within ESSA in order to help California provide the well-rounded education that's inclusive of science for all students TK to 12.

04:46:45.135 --> 04:46:54.384
We feel that doing so is not only in service to our students but it also helps support the state LCFF priority to offer a broad course of study as well as implementation of state standards.

04:46:55.224 --> 04:47:07.389
We feel that leveraging ESSA to support science, to offer professional learning is really critical for our science educators and educators, both administrators, elementary school teachers, all teachers of science.

04:47:08.009 --> 04:47:15.673
This is critical with the loss of the Mass Science Partnership grants, and we look forward to continuing to work with the department in order to support science.

04:47:15.813 --> 04:47:16.093
Thank you.

04:47:19.753 --> 04:47:22.857
Thank you, Terry Burns, on behalf of the California School Boards Association.

04:47:23.438 --> 04:47:29.146
We share your concerns about the regulation language on supplement not supplant.

04:47:29.186 --> 04:47:31.749
We will be submitting a similar letter this week.

04:47:32.991 --> 04:47:35.915
We also appreciate that you have taken the ESSA plan

04:47:36.716 --> 04:47:43.180
in pieces so that we can share it with our members, get comments, and address all of those concerns.

04:47:44.540 --> 04:47:49.243
Member Rucker talked earlier about the discussion on substantial weight for academics.

04:47:49.723 --> 04:47:57.608
We would really love to have you have that conversation and engage in that as soon as possible, because I think that's going to drive a lot of this.

04:47:58.288 --> 04:48:00.070
And we encourage you to be bold.

04:48:01.071 --> 04:48:02.412
This should be our plan.

04:48:02.452 --> 04:48:04.974
This should not be the Fed's plan that's given to us.

04:48:05.475 --> 04:48:17.405
We've done a lot of work to develop an accountability system that has great promise, and we should submit the California plan, not a plan that's simply tied to regs and requirements.

04:48:17.626 --> 04:48:17.946
Thank you.

04:48:21.169 --> 04:48:23.172
Good afternoon, Martha Alvarez from AXA.

04:48:23.732 --> 04:48:37.331
We'll be providing more comments in the letter in January to the State Board, but I'll just mention for the time being that we have been engaging with our members about the Title II funding and the set-asides if the state was to pursue the $150 million to $200 million that Dr. Kirst mentioned.

04:48:37.952 --> 04:48:40.355
sort of what would our members like to see in that capacity building.

04:48:40.976 --> 04:48:46.364
We have heard a different definition of what they think needs to be the capacity building, how that looks like at the local level.

04:48:46.805 --> 04:48:52.434
And so I think it's important to consider where we can better enhance the funds, whether it be at the local level through grants.

04:48:53.054 --> 04:48:56.077
given to school districts directly or more of the state support.

04:48:56.677 --> 04:49:06.225
Where we would be helpful from the State Department of Education would be if we are able to get any specific questions where you need our feedback, it is a very massive plan to tackle.

04:49:06.606 --> 04:49:12.991
So as we go to our members asking for a lot of feedback on that accountability system, local performance indicators, and many other measures,

04:49:13.471 --> 04:49:20.873
It's difficult to sort of ask them for their feedback when they have full-time jobs without not understanding what are those key points that you need to hear from us.

04:49:21.193 --> 04:49:27.395
We'll be identifying the priorities on behalf of AXA, but to be able to help you, it would be helpful to know the questions that you have for us.

04:49:27.695 --> 04:49:28.015
Thank you.

04:49:28.035 --> 04:49:32.977
Okay, that concludes the public testimony.

04:49:32.997 --> 04:49:37.558
Board Member Sun, do you want to make any comments as federal liaison on this?

04:49:38.860 --> 04:49:55.213
No, I think the process of how we engage stakeholders in something so massive, and I think that last suggestion about help frame it a bit, right, so that you can get useful, constructive feedback.

04:49:56.234 --> 04:49:56.794
Very helpful.

04:49:58.135 --> 04:50:01.238
Okay, I think we're ready for a motion then.

04:50:02.159 --> 04:50:02.459
Okay.

04:50:05.365 --> 04:50:13.109
Yes, approve the letter giving authority to the President and State Board and the State Superintendent to do that.

04:50:13.149 --> 04:50:18.471
So I will move the recommendation of the department.

04:50:23.193 --> 04:50:26.155
Because we didn't talk about a supplement versus a plan.

04:50:26.595 --> 04:50:30.857
So can you give some general comments as to what your feedback would be to the department?

04:50:31.849 --> 04:50:35.439
Let me ask our Council Dave Sapp to speak to that.

04:50:40.441 --> 04:51:02.962
So the item that was posted with the materials on this included a summary of the basic thrust or focus, which is on the statute underlying the supplement not-to-plant regs, specifies that the federal government can't prescribe particular methodologies or tests for it, whereas the proposed regs identify three possible options that states must use.

04:51:03.002 --> 04:51:06.145
So the general thrust of the comments is reflected in the item.

04:51:06.585 --> 04:51:15.813
would be to sort of stick with the statutory framework and to allow states the discretion to develop methodologies that are consistent and will work to meet that statutory requirement.

04:51:16.233 --> 04:51:23.459
The letter is still in draft form, it isn't finalized at this point, so it's not ready to be presented publicly for that reason.

04:51:23.860 --> 04:51:32.667
This is a very important issue, I wanna make sure the language is as precise and clear as possible, but that's the general thrust of the letter as identified in the item.

04:51:36.781 --> 04:51:41.765
Yeah, I haven't seen a draft of the letter, so I can't comment.

04:51:42.185 --> 04:51:46.249
Second the motion.

04:51:46.309 --> 04:51:47.990
All right, second.

04:51:48.671 --> 04:51:51.913
Okay, all those in favor, raise your hand.

04:51:53.094 --> 04:51:55.556
Okay, that's passed.

04:51:55.696 --> 04:51:56.797
So thank you, Barbara.

04:51:57.492 --> 04:52:07.347
Oh wait, did we make a decision about how board members were supposed to give feedback or to pass information on to the staff about this draft?

04:52:07.647 --> 04:52:09.069
Did we come to an agreement about that?

04:52:15.029 --> 04:52:15.909
That's not what I'm asking.

04:52:15.929 --> 04:52:17.270
I didn't ask when it was coming back.

04:52:17.710 --> 04:52:26.875
I asked, did we come to an agreement on how board members would give feedback to the staff about what's contained in this draft?

04:52:28.775 --> 04:52:30.176
No, that was not part of the motion.

04:52:30.236 --> 04:52:31.857
No, I mean, I did not.

04:52:32.157 --> 04:52:33.558
The answer is no, we did not.

04:52:39.207 --> 04:52:46.635
Okay, I guess we're ready then for item six, the CASP recommendations.

04:52:51.260 --> 04:52:51.941
Good afternoon.

04:52:53.122 --> 04:52:55.605
Michelle Sutter, Director of the Assessment Division.

04:52:55.665 --> 04:52:57.587
It really doesn't sound like these are on, but

04:53:01.580 --> 04:53:12.848
The action before you today is the release of up to 10% of the withhold of the 2015-16 CASP contract with ETS, Educational Testing Service.

04:53:13.568 --> 04:53:19.912
As with any state contract, a withhold of 10% is applied to every invoice that we receive from our contractor.

04:53:20.573 --> 04:53:31.000
The CASP contract with ETS also stipulates within that contract criteria by which each task is reviewed to be deemed successfully completed.

04:53:32.000 --> 04:53:42.085
As part of an annual process, the department reviewed the contract requirements, the deliverables that we received against the successful completion requirements outlined in the contract.

04:53:43.986 --> 04:53:48.868
In doing so, during that review, we asked that the board approve the following.

04:53:49.749 --> 04:53:53.050
The release of a total of $8,369,960.24 from funds withheld during the 15-16 testing administration.

04:54:00.754 --> 04:54:09.780
Please note that this amount is almost the entire amount of the 10% funds that were withheld, an indication of the successful year that we had testing.

04:54:10.661 --> 04:54:30.494
The CDE is also asking the board to approve the recommendation to withhold $271,952.56, a relatively small portion from the contractor for specific components of Task 3, which is technology services, and Task 9, reporting results.

04:54:32.194 --> 04:54:39.856
And I have been asked to be very brief in all of my presentations, so I am open to President Kirsten.

04:54:40.296 --> 04:54:48.118
Board member, questions on that brief presentation?

04:54:48.138 --> 04:54:56.340
I don't hear any questions.

04:54:56.400 --> 04:54:57.940
I think we'll proceed to public comment.

04:55:00.089 --> 04:55:01.750
We have one speaker, Doug McRae.

04:55:09.757 --> 04:55:11.739
Yes, good afternoon.

04:55:12.279 --> 04:55:14.741
I'm Doug McRae, retired assessing specialist.

04:55:16.002 --> 04:55:23.249
The threshold score part of the California Alternative Assessment Test should be subject to non-release of funds.

04:55:24.590 --> 04:55:26.651
Last week I submitted a six-page handout

04:55:28.053 --> 04:55:37.105
to your folder, focused on the extreme differences between the CAA threshold scores and the model NICSEC threshold scores.

04:55:37.706 --> 04:55:45.195
Today I have a handout addendum, which I think went around this morning, one page on green, that

04:55:47.786 --> 04:55:56.756
has further questions on the validity of the threshold scores as well as the adequacy of the test question data used to establish the threshold scores.

04:55:57.597 --> 04:56:06.446
These two handouts present evidence that the 2016 CAA tests were, in a word, too difficult for the students, particularly the math tests.

04:56:07.707 --> 04:56:22.691
Page one of my initial handout suggests how a non-release of ATS funds might be handled until the flaws of the threshold scores are evaluated by an independent expert with resolution by January.

04:56:23.731 --> 04:56:31.113
Finally, ETS is preparing a flawed test scores distribution to 35,000 students this month.

04:56:31.153 --> 04:56:31.433
Time.

04:56:31.713 --> 04:56:36.574
Those reports should not be distributed while important validity and credibility concerns are evaluated.

04:56:37.074 --> 04:56:37.394
Thank you.

04:56:37.414 --> 04:56:43.279
Okay, further board discussion on this item?

04:56:45.100 --> 04:56:47.302
Seeing none, all those in favor, raise your hands.

04:56:47.322 --> 04:56:48.423
I don't think we have a motion.

04:56:48.763 --> 04:56:49.764
Oh, motion, sorry.

04:56:53.387 --> 04:56:55.248
Okay, I'll make the motion.

04:56:55.528 --> 04:56:56.029
I'll second.

04:56:56.989 --> 04:56:57.550
Recommendation?

04:56:58.691 --> 04:56:59.611
Okay, thank you.

04:56:59.752 --> 04:57:00.112
Okay.

04:57:01.193 --> 04:57:02.734
All those in favor, raise your hands now.

04:57:02.914 --> 04:57:03.875
Okay, that one's done.

04:57:07.324 --> 04:57:09.107
Okay, now item seven on LPAC.

04:57:16.428 --> 04:57:18.489
Okay, you're looking at yourselves, right?

04:57:18.689 --> 04:57:24.532
Okay, so item seven is the LPAC regulations.

04:57:24.592 --> 04:57:26.413
This is an action item before you today.

04:57:27.173 --> 04:57:36.918
This item asks the board to approve proposed changes to these regulations, approve the commencement of a 15-day public comment period for the proposed regulations,

04:57:37.618 --> 04:57:43.742
If no relevant comments are received during that 15 day public comment period, the regulations would be deemed adopted.

04:57:44.242 --> 04:57:51.607
If relevant comments are received, CDE staff will respond and be directed to place the proposed regulations on the January agenda.

04:57:53.108 --> 04:58:06.196
The motion also asks that the board to authorize CDE staff to take any ministerial or procedural actions that may be required to address any concerns from the Office of Administrative Law during their review of the rulemaking file.

04:58:07.532 --> 04:58:15.134
Most of the proposed changes that you see are based on feedback that was received during the 45-day public comment period.

04:58:15.694 --> 04:58:17.855
We received written comments from three parties.

04:58:18.835 --> 04:58:24.656
Responses to those comments are provided in the final statement of reasons as attachment three to this board item.

04:58:25.757 --> 04:58:30.058
Other changes were also made by the department to improve clarity on procedures.

04:58:31.375 --> 04:58:36.537
So there were several changes made, but I'd like to just highlight three of them in my comments.

04:58:38.077 --> 04:58:43.659
One would be the change to make sure that it was clear that these regulations apply only to LPAC.

04:58:45.400 --> 04:58:50.422
We wanted to make sure that there was no confusion out in the field, that these regulations apply to CELT.

04:58:51.562 --> 04:59:02.641
It also clarifies that these regulations are operative when Superintendent Torlakson reports to the legislature that the LPAC assessments are ready for administration as required by Education Code.

04:59:03.573 --> 04:59:05.475
That's one important change.

04:59:05.916 --> 04:59:12.182
The next change I want to highlight to you is the regulations also address the correction of classification errors for English only students.

04:59:12.863 --> 04:59:23.474
This has been amended to require local educational agencies to notify parents at least 10 calendar days prior to administering the initial assessment to the pupil.

04:59:25.154 --> 04:59:42.769
The last change that I want to highlight is we clarified the amount of time an LEA has to administer the initial assessment, locally produce the official score, and notify the parents or guardians in writing of the results, and that is within 30 calendar days after the pupil's date of initial California enrollment.

04:59:43.269 --> 04:59:46.232
So those are the three changes within the regulations I wanted to highlight.

04:59:46.532 --> 04:59:50.235
There are others, but mostly I would say classify them as clarification.

04:59:53.368 --> 04:59:56.470
Okay, board member comments on these changes.

04:59:59.452 --> 05:00:03.474
We had three comments on this and now it's going out for another 45 day period.

05:00:03.494 --> 05:00:03.794
Not a 15.

05:00:03.834 --> 05:00:03.954
15, not 45.

05:00:03.994 --> 05:00:04.075
Okay.

05:00:11.340 --> 05:00:15.122
Okay, Board Member Ortiz-Lacon.

05:00:15.762 --> 05:00:18.923
I was telling Board Member Strauss that this is going to be a new common for you.

05:00:19.583 --> 05:00:30.288
I'm going to thank you for all the work that you've done and for really listening to some of the input and the feedback, not only from the public, but also from some of the liaisons, including Board Member Strauss and myself.

05:00:33.089 --> 05:00:45.857
You worked really hard, you and your team, and you should be commended for that, because you really, we had some discussions, there was a lot of back and forth, and at the end, I really felt that the input was considered and, when possible, included.

05:00:45.877 --> 05:00:55.323
I know that one of the comments was around a primary screener, and it is beyond the scope of this process of the regulations, but I'm happy

05:00:55.863 --> 05:01:02.305
to hear that it will be likely included in the guidance that goes out to the school districts.

05:01:02.625 --> 05:01:05.266
So again, thank you, and I wanna thank your team for all the hard work.

05:01:08.867 --> 05:01:12.508
Okay, other board comments on the LPAC regulations?

05:01:15.408 --> 05:01:16.449
Not public comment.

05:01:17.229 --> 05:01:17.829
Doug McCray.

05:01:28.677 --> 05:01:29.137
Good afternoon.

05:01:29.177 --> 05:01:31.499
I'm Doug McRae, a retired testing specialist.

05:01:31.559 --> 05:01:35.281
I submitted a one-page handout to your electronic folder on this item last week.

05:01:35.941 --> 05:01:53.111
In July, I suggested a revision for the summit of LPAC test administration window in the draft regs from a recommended February through May window to a January through April window tied to individual school calendars parallel to the current CASP regs on test administration windows.

05:01:54.251 --> 05:01:59.916
I supported the revision with seven reasons why the January through April window should be preferred.

05:02:01.478 --> 05:02:09.005
CDE rejected this suggestion with a non-responsive reply, citing only LPAC statutory language.

05:02:10.286 --> 05:02:16.791
My suggested revision window is consistent with LPAC statute, as detailed in the one-page handout.

05:02:18.037 --> 05:02:28.843
I'd ask the state board to hold open this issue until the CDE provides reasons for maintaining the February through May window, which overlaps and conflicts with the CASP test administration window.

05:02:29.783 --> 05:02:30.103
Thank you.

05:02:32.324 --> 05:02:32.705
Okay.

05:02:34.085 --> 05:02:35.726
There's no further board discussion.

05:02:35.806 --> 05:02:39.148
I'm ready for a motion on the CDE recommendation.

05:02:40.128 --> 05:02:41.909
I move approval, CDE recommendation.

05:02:43.690 --> 05:02:44.110
I second.

05:02:45.922 --> 05:02:48.204
All right, all those in favor, raise your hands.

05:02:48.684 --> 05:02:49.125
We're done.

05:02:50.706 --> 05:02:55.731
Okay, now we're on the S. P. E. Priorities agenda item eight.

05:02:56.912 --> 05:03:06.380
So let me start with asking for taking up the minutes, uh, and ask if there's any public comment on the minutes.

05:03:09.283 --> 05:03:10.684
No public comment on the minutes.

05:03:11.444 --> 05:03:12.986
Do I have a motion to approve the minutes?

05:03:17.145 --> 05:03:18.806
Okay, approved and seconded.

05:03:19.087 --> 05:03:20.648
All those in favor, raise your hand.

05:03:21.729 --> 05:03:28.494
Okay, now I'm ready for member bird to review the S. P. Screening committee's recommendations for appointments.

05:03:28.974 --> 05:03:29.354
Thank you.

05:03:30.015 --> 05:03:34.798
You should have a copy of the item addendum in your baskets for item eight.

05:03:35.399 --> 05:03:36.460
This is the time of year.

05:03:36.520 --> 05:03:44.466
In addition to the fun time we have select making recommendations about the student members is to repopulate our advisory committees.

05:03:45.546 --> 05:03:48.568
So if you bear with me, I'll go through them one by one.

05:03:49.288 --> 05:03:54.030
We had one vacancy on the advisory commission for charter schools.

05:03:54.510 --> 05:03:57.632
The county superintendent slot was vacant.

05:03:58.792 --> 05:04:09.417
And thanks to the assistance of member Williams, we'd like to recommend that John Gundry, the county superintendent for Santa Clara County be appointed to that position.

05:04:10.297 --> 05:04:16.501
In addition, there are three members of the advisory commission that we would like to recommend be reappointed.

05:04:16.901 --> 05:04:27.849
Atiyani Howard, who's the parent representative, Brian Bauer, who's the charter school representative, and Curtis Washington, who is the teacher representative for the ACCS.

05:04:28.389 --> 05:04:34.693
And in the item, you'll see their terms that we're recommending they be appointed from January 2017 to December 2018.

05:04:38.015 --> 05:04:42.317
And I think I can do these all together, yeah, so we don't have to have separate votes.

05:04:43.117 --> 05:04:54.822
The next committee, we're actually, these are all reappointments upon the advice of our liaison, Nikki Sandoval, for the Advisory Commission on Special Education.

05:04:55.382 --> 05:05:02.285
We're recommending reappointing Keila Rodriguez, who's the parent on the committee, of a parent in a charter school.

05:05:03.145 --> 05:05:12.870
Sarah, I'm not sure I'm pronouncing her last name correctly, Jochum, who's a district administrator, and Summer Harding, who is a parent and also a school principal.

05:05:13.810 --> 05:05:16.012
Those terms are from January 2017 to December 2020.

05:05:19.753 --> 05:05:31.515
The Child Nutrition Advisory Commission, we recruited for two new members, and then we also are recommending reappointment with the help of my colleague Feliz Ortiz-Licone.

05:05:32.095 --> 05:05:42.977
We're recommending Patrick Trainor be appointed as the curriculum coordinator on CNAC, and that Maria Elena Gallagher be appointed as the teacher on CNAC.

05:05:43.537 --> 05:05:47.538
We're also recommending reappointment of Barbara Rohrer, who's a school board member,

05:05:48.630 --> 05:05:54.136
Lucy McProud, who is a consultant, and Lawrence Herrera, who's a school administrator.

05:05:55.158 --> 05:05:57.460
Those appointments are from January 2017 to December 2019.

05:06:03.209 --> 05:06:07.412
Maria Elena Gallagher's term is from November 2016 to December 2017.

05:06:07.612 --> 05:06:21.520
And then for our last committee at the California Practitioner Advisory Group, again with Feliz's assistance, we're recommending appointing Linda Kaminsky as the superintendent representative.

05:06:21.840 --> 05:06:22.280
we're recommending.

05:06:22.300 --> 05:06:34.884
Nancy Laura as a teacher representative and John Damien Huntley as a teacher representative, and we're recommending reappointment of Neva Rowden, who's the para educator serving on C peg.

05:06:35.624 --> 05:06:41.006
Those terms differ a little bit because we have staggered terms and you can see the terms that are there for C peg.

05:06:41.926 --> 05:06:45.027
So I would like to move the recommendations of the screening

05:06:51.661 --> 05:06:51.861
No.

05:06:52.502 --> 05:06:52.782
All right.

05:06:53.202 --> 05:06:55.124
Any no further board discussion?

05:06:55.144 --> 05:06:56.545
All in favor, raise your hand.

05:07:00.127 --> 05:07:01.969
Okay, that passes.

05:07:03.089 --> 05:07:08.653
Now we're on to the updates on board member liaison reports.

05:07:09.354 --> 05:07:13.877
And let me start with IQC Mathematics, Rucker and Strauss.

05:07:15.018 --> 05:07:15.598
Any update?

05:07:16.639 --> 05:07:22.625
So I'm going to do some of the IQC academics all together if that's okay around the communities.

05:07:22.865 --> 05:07:25.808
Well, I'll just do my piece and then maybe you can add on as well.

05:07:26.008 --> 05:07:26.128
Okay.

05:07:26.288 --> 05:07:26.509
All right.

05:07:26.869 --> 05:07:37.579
So there's a coordinating effort through the Department of Education, the success of the county school superintendent and state board to coordinate the implementation of academic standards.

05:07:37.599 --> 05:07:39.361
So there's a standards coordinating committee.

05:07:39.961 --> 05:07:42.643
and there's some really thoughtful, exciting work going on.

05:07:42.683 --> 05:07:49.508
So I'm just gonna talk about, I'll talk about math and science, ELA, and then you maybe can add on the history piece as well.

05:07:49.868 --> 05:07:52.109
So we've had separate meetings.

05:07:52.169 --> 05:07:58.674
There's a Bechtel grant that's funding the rollout, continued rollout of science and math of 1.3 million.

05:07:59.234 --> 05:08:02.436
Bechtel's been very excited about the work, and the idea is to take the 58 counties

05:08:04.157 --> 05:08:05.838
which is now divided into 11 regions.

05:08:05.858 --> 05:08:06.818
You should know L.A.

05:08:06.878 --> 05:08:16.142
County, which serves about 25% of the students in California, is one region, but all the other regions are multiple counties to try to build capacity across the state.

05:08:16.622 --> 05:08:21.844
And so they've had a collaboration committee, and starting in December,

05:08:22.424 --> 05:08:32.631
There'll be three two-day meetings where we'll build capacity of networks and these leaders in science and math and ELD have been working on the curriculum and content of it.

05:08:33.091 --> 05:08:43.178
And so we've actually asked at some point in our state board if we have time in January to give an update on what our efforts are statewide for the continued rollout.

05:08:43.558 --> 05:08:49.022
And so very exciting, December 15th and 16th are the math and science here in Sacramento.

05:08:49.662 --> 05:08:52.044
It's a very, very exciting work on that.

05:08:52.724 --> 05:08:58.586
So I think I'll stop with that and see if, because I had some other areas, but if you wanted to add anything, Member Rucker?

05:09:02.647 --> 05:09:04.527
I forgot to turn on the mic.

05:09:04.707 --> 05:09:12.130
Since our board meeting in September, there was an IQC meeting on the 22nd, and there were a number of areas that were covered.

05:09:12.190 --> 05:09:17.211
The science framework activities, I know that Board Member Williams will cover that.

05:09:17.771 --> 05:09:27.397
But there is some additional work that's being undertaken now to develop the new health subject matter framework, the health education framework.

05:09:27.437 --> 05:09:31.180
That work is being undertaken now and that is just now beginning.

05:09:31.680 --> 05:09:36.103
And so we'll be continuing to do the reporting out on that from the IQC.

05:09:36.903 --> 05:09:53.360
The History-Social Science Committee is now undertaking the work to update, to begin the instructional materials adoption process, and so a timeline was adopted for that process, beginning with training the people who will be the reviewers in the spring,

05:09:53.800 --> 05:10:08.854
and we anticipate, according to the timeline, that they'll begin receiving the materials that are being prepared by publishers in the late spring, and they will be reconvened in the summer to go over their reviews and to submit their recommendations.

05:10:08.914 --> 05:10:13.759
So, an adoption recommendation will be coming to the Board at some point next fall.

05:10:14.299 --> 05:10:25.764
One of the things that was unique to this process, Stephanie Gregson's staff convened a publisher's forum that took place the day following the IQC meeting.

05:10:25.804 --> 05:10:30.066
So the IQC meeting itself was on Thursday the 22nd.

05:10:30.186 --> 05:10:32.507
On September 23rd, there was a publisher's forum.

05:10:32.987 --> 05:10:36.309
that was convened, and a number of publishers participated.

05:10:36.709 --> 05:10:44.374
It was their opportunity to ask questions about not only the framework and the changes in the framework, but also to discuss the criteria.

05:10:44.774 --> 05:10:51.958
It was a very collegial, very jovial, and jovial is a good word for it, because there was not a lot of controversy that arose.

05:10:51.978 --> 05:10:56.801
But all of the people who participated, all the publishers who came, were very happy to be there.

05:10:56.841 --> 05:11:01.384
And I saw earlier today there were some people who came to the publishers' convening.

05:11:02.545 --> 05:11:10.412
who did share their feedback that they were very happy about that convening and having that opportunity to be there for that activity.

05:11:10.853 --> 05:11:19.421
The other element that came up, and it's a conversation that's going to continue, you may recall, and Board Member Sandoval and I have talked about this,

05:11:21.162 --> 05:11:23.083
and the IQC is also looking at it.

05:11:23.123 --> 05:11:45.758
The issue separate from the framework itself is to take a look at how we will monitor or make sure that members of the public who had a great deal of concern about how the content would be rolled out, particularly concerning the development of curriculum about the history of South Asia, how there will be an opportunity for them also to participate in that vetting process.

05:11:46.178 --> 05:11:48.100
and to give some of their feedback as well.

05:11:48.160 --> 05:11:53.304
So that conversation is still an ongoing conversation, and we'll see how that folds out.

05:11:53.324 --> 05:12:02.132
But the publishers were very satisfied with the opportunity to have that conversation and to meet and do some work on reviewing and developing that.

05:12:07.416 --> 05:12:10.459
IQC, ELA, ELD, Strauss.

05:12:11.636 --> 05:12:22.367
Well, just to follow up on the rollouts is that we are looking for additional grant money to continue ELALD and history, social science, and continue with our framework.

05:12:22.407 --> 05:12:29.914
But there's a real strong discussion about ELD as a common thread and literacy across all of our contents.

05:12:31.136 --> 05:12:36.660
We all know that we put in those strategies in all of our frameworks, and we're going back to put that in math.

05:12:36.720 --> 05:12:43.324
So again, the specialists worked really, really hard on planning what we need to do to build capacity.

05:12:43.845 --> 05:12:48.828
But again, I'm hoping that some of this will be connected as well in our statewide efforts on our ESSA plan as well.

05:12:51.050 --> 05:12:54.933
Okay, IQC Science, Williams.

05:12:56.969 --> 05:13:02.311
Most of it's been covered, except the curriculum, no, no, it's totally fine.

05:13:03.052 --> 05:13:22.160
The Curriculum Framework Committee and the IQC finished their work on the Curriculum Framework, which you'll hear about tomorrow, and they finished that with a final public phone call that several of us were on, and it went really well, and everybody's so happy that it's over.

05:13:22.820 --> 05:13:28.201
and it's really, really done very well and everyone is really satisfied with that.

05:13:28.322 --> 05:13:31.302
So I'm glad that that piece of the work is finished.

05:13:31.362 --> 05:13:42.965
We still have several other pieces in terms of the assessment and how it fits into accountability and the instructional materials review, but this was a huge effort and they did a really great job.

05:13:43.205 --> 05:13:44.206
You'll hear about it tomorrow.

05:13:46.506 --> 05:13:49.307
Okay, IQC Computer Science, Williams.

05:13:51.124 --> 05:14:17.726
Okay, so far there's nothing with IQC exactly on computer science, except that the CDE, which I guess means this IQC, is convening three focus groups in November to obtain feedback from the public on what they might want to see from the state on either standards or some kind of guidance on implementing computer science in the classrooms.

05:14:18.546 --> 05:14:22.189
And those are in Sacramento, San Francisco, and San Diego.

05:14:22.209 --> 05:14:25.611
I will be at the one that's in San Diego, since that's where I live.

05:14:26.151 --> 05:14:29.433
And I'm really looking forward to hearing what the public is interested in.

05:14:29.453 --> 05:14:41.181
I have a couple of more things on computer science that I'll go ahead and announce at the same time, because this has been a big, a lot of traction and a lot of momentum around computer science just in the last month.

05:14:42.181 --> 05:14:54.747
There was a new national first ever of its kind consensus framework developed for bringing computer science education into K-12, and that was released on October 17th.

05:14:55.427 --> 05:15:06.993
I represented the state board as a stakeholder in that process and attended several meetings on that, as did Tom Adams and Dean Reese, who's the chair of the Ed Tech Committee for the IQC.

05:15:08.554 --> 05:15:10.395
and we have met with them since then.

05:15:10.896 --> 05:15:22.146
It's getting quite a bit of national recognition, and people are very interested in seeing it, and an example of, or hearing about it, and some examples of that are that,

05:15:23.867 --> 05:15:37.873
I and Hadi Partovi, who is the CEO and founder of Code.org, have been invited by AXA to present at the Superintendent's Symposium in February on Computer Science Education.

05:15:38.433 --> 05:15:46.716
President Kirst and I are presenting November 15th at the Silicon Valley Ed Foundation on Computer Science Education.

05:15:47.217 --> 05:15:50.078
It's a three-hour symposium with three panels,

05:15:50.698 --> 05:15:57.842
and they have invited every superintendent in San Mateo County or Santa Clara County and their staff to attend that meeting.

05:15:58.742 --> 05:16:12.069
And in addition, I will be presenting with Pat Young Prattett, who was the lead for the new National Framework on Computer Science Education, will be presenting a centerpiece session at the California Charter School Association.

05:16:12.629 --> 05:16:16.011
So there's already a great deal of excitement around computer science.

05:16:16.071 --> 05:16:25.276
It's kind of organic and really unusual to see, and I wouldn't have expected it, given everything else that LEAs have been asked to do by the state board over the last couple of years.

05:16:25.997 --> 05:16:38.824
And finally, just to add to that momentum, the new computer science principles AP course, which has been piloted the past two years in California and several other places,

05:16:39.344 --> 05:16:45.929
was approved and the exam approved by the College Board and it is live this year for the first time.

05:16:46.710 --> 05:16:55.056
And the College Board reports that they're getting tremendous interest in it from around the country in schools wanting to offer it.

05:16:55.096 --> 05:17:00.841
It's a broad access course intended to attract a more diverse audience to computer science.

05:17:01.581 --> 05:17:13.729
And so far, just in the first two months of this year, over 200 high schools in California have submitted a syllabi to get approved so that they can teach that course.

05:17:14.149 --> 05:17:21.754
And I was told by the College Board they'd never seen that kind of interest in a first time released new AP course by them.

05:17:21.774 --> 05:17:24.356
Okay, good.

05:17:24.416 --> 05:17:28.759
Board Member Holiday, Environmental Literacy.

05:17:38.149 --> 05:17:54.680
Environmental literacy is not going to appear on the State Board agenda anytime soon, but I thought you might be interested in hearing what is going on with environmental literacy in the state and how connected many of the things that we're doing are to the efforts on behalf of environmental literacy.

05:17:55.160 --> 05:18:03.248
In 2015, Superintendent Torlakson and 47-member Environmental Literacy Task Force created the Blueprint for Environmental Literacy.

05:18:03.688 --> 05:18:13.337
And that blueprint is a rallying call for all administrators and school classroom teachers to infuse environmental literacy into and throughout all academic disciplines.

05:18:13.978 --> 05:18:24.979
The goal is to ensure that eventually every student develops the knowledge, the skills, and the abilities necessary to make sound, informed decisions about environmental issues that face our society.

05:18:26.298 --> 05:18:46.547
Superintendent Torokson, in collaboration with the California Environmental Protection Agency, the California Natural Resources Agency, and a range of educational and nonprofit organizations, has convened an Environmental Literacy Steering Committee to create an implementation plan for the blueprint and immediately pursue many of the highest priority recommendations.

05:18:47.467 --> 05:18:50.489
I am on that steering committee as well.

05:18:51.609 --> 05:18:55.671
And so far in 2016, here are some of the accomplishments of this group.

05:18:56.681 --> 05:19:06.587
The steering committee has already secured $3.6 million in funding from private foundations to advance the work of the environmental literacy blueprint.

05:19:07.048 --> 05:19:21.037
The committee has collaborated and worked with three California subject matter projects, history, social science, science and international studies to create new professional learning modules that incorporate environmental literacy into the frameworks.

05:19:21.737 --> 05:19:30.326
The committee has partnered with the Lawrence Hall of Science to expand their STEM LCAP toolkit to include environmental literacy as part of that toolkit.

05:19:30.996 --> 05:19:45.225
The committee has engaged in a re-envisioning of the California Regional Environmental Education Community, known as CREEC, to bring that network to scale so that all educators in all communities will benefit from the services of that organization.

05:19:46.006 --> 05:19:56.293
And the committee is in the process of identifying pilot districts that will develop district environmental literacy blueprints that will fully support

05:19:56.933 --> 05:19:59.255
that district's LCAP goals as well.

05:19:59.975 --> 05:20:15.826
So, as I said, this is not a part of our work necessarily, but I thought you'd be interested in hearing about what that steering committee is working on, the success they're having, and how it does blend with a lot of the things that we do here.

05:20:16.706 --> 05:20:19.488
And this committee's working under whose auspices?

05:20:19.648 --> 05:20:22.010
I mean, who's appointed it and so on?

05:20:23.897 --> 05:20:27.759
Okay, could you describe that, the origin of it?

05:20:28.019 --> 05:20:29.640
I'm sort of getting in the middle of the movie here.

05:20:30.221 --> 05:20:33.182
Well, we had the task, thank you, and thanks for that great report.

05:20:33.242 --> 05:20:37.064
Yeah, the idea had come from a long time back.

05:20:37.084 --> 05:20:42.387
About three years ago, we convened this task force, and we didn't want just another report to sit on a shelf.

05:20:42.427 --> 05:20:46.550
We wanted to actualize it and sought a great team.

05:20:47.430 --> 05:20:52.173
Will Parrish from Ten Strands and Terry Tenement's been involved in giving advice.

05:20:53.013 --> 05:20:58.335
really got a good team going and they have found philanthropy interested in funding this.

05:20:58.396 --> 05:21:03.958
And some of the work is already gonna be reflected in the science standards as they unfold tomorrow.

05:21:04.898 --> 05:21:19.225
And it's to integrate it throughout all curriculum and make sure our schools produce good consumers who make good choices and good voters who make good choices at the ballot box that understand the environmental issues and the science issues and the politics of it all.

05:21:19.845 --> 05:21:31.636
And one of the things that excites me the most about environmental literacy and the approach that this steering committee is taking and that the blueprint outlines is that environmental content, environmental topics work.

05:21:32.236 --> 05:21:33.597
They work for math.

05:21:33.658 --> 05:21:34.538
They work for English.

05:21:34.618 --> 05:21:36.440
They work for history and social studies.

05:21:36.940 --> 05:21:38.101
They work for science.

05:21:38.141 --> 05:21:40.063
They work across all disciplines.

05:21:42.505 --> 05:21:52.513
relate to them, understand them, get excited about them, and do well in all disciplines when environmental literacy at the right times is a part of that curriculum.

05:21:54.334 --> 05:22:01.640
Okay, now we're ready for the Advisory Committee on Special Ed.

05:22:06.949 --> 05:22:18.436
Okay, the Advisory Commission on Special Education met for two very full days last week, and the first thing I'd like to do is commend the CDE staff, the different divisions.

05:22:19.376 --> 05:22:30.803
What's happened is there's been a real active seeking of counsel from commissioners related to special education issues, so as we're working towards one coherent system.

05:22:31.423 --> 05:22:38.088
There's really evidence of that moving forward, and of the task force report recommendations actually being implemented.

05:22:38.148 --> 05:22:46.673
So that I think is a really promising development, and it's taken a lot of good thinking and reaching out early in the process.

05:22:47.714 --> 05:22:50.276
So I want to acknowledge that, the department staff for that.

05:22:51.016 --> 05:22:57.701
And we're seeing people in the disability community engaging with these different efforts simultaneously.

05:22:58.301 --> 05:22:59.422
So that's a great thing.

05:23:01.383 --> 05:23:09.953
We heard a presentation also from the California Education Resources Center for the Blind and Visually Impaired, and that's part of the California School for the Blind.

05:23:10.674 --> 05:23:19.824
And this entity supports students with visual impairments, not just at the School for the Blind, but local education agencies through assistive technology.

05:23:20.425 --> 05:23:23.970
orientation and mobility instruction and staff development.

05:23:24.471 --> 05:23:29.598
And the roots go back to 1860 with a one-room schoolhouse in San Francisco.

05:23:29.738 --> 05:23:32.582
So this has been going on for a very long time.

05:23:34.104 --> 05:23:39.628
We also heard about another promising initiative that brings different agencies together.

05:23:39.648 --> 05:23:51.236
Representatives from CDE, the Department of Rehabilitation, and the California Department of Developmental Services are working together on a blueprint for competitive integrated employment.

05:23:51.776 --> 05:23:57.318
And what that means is competitive is a customary wage and benefits.

05:23:57.498 --> 05:24:03.680
Integrated means a location where employees are interacting with other persons who are not individuals with disabilities.

05:24:04.280 --> 05:24:05.880
And employment means paid work.

05:24:06.120 --> 05:24:10.702
And the quick phrase for that, real work for real pay in the real world.

05:24:11.642 --> 05:24:17.347
And the blueprint is the what, and the next step for implementation is the how, how this is going to roll out.

05:24:17.828 --> 05:24:19.409
We also heard student voices.

05:24:19.910 --> 05:24:33.482
We had a very compelling testimony from a young leader, and she was talking about the need for including disability history for youth empowerment and how that has been very influential in her own development as a leader.

05:24:34.843 --> 05:24:37.404
and very powerful student voices there.

05:24:38.065 --> 05:24:57.498
Another recurring theme that I think is important to mention, and it also I think connects with the student voices we heard this morning relating to mental health issues, social and emotional learning and mental health is an emergent focal point in the disability community, and that came through loud and clear throughout the two days.

05:24:58.659 --> 05:25:03.342
And we also heard a presentation on the health education framework revision,

05:25:04.142 --> 05:25:18.218
And again, the team that presented from the department were very proactive and specified ways that commissioners and other members of the disability community can engage in the process so that it can be as inclusive as possible from the get-go.

05:25:18.939 --> 05:25:23.722
And I also want to acknowledge the great work that Kristen Wright is doing, formerly of state board staff.

05:25:24.162 --> 05:25:37.390
She's already connected, she's just jumped right in, and she is connecting with leaders in institutes of higher education, deans of schools of education, to talk about teacher preparation as it relates to special education.

05:25:38.350 --> 05:25:56.847
So a lot happening, and I also want to acknowledge, finally, the commissioners are very active members in the commission work that informs the state board, but also the various work groups, stakeholder groups, everything that's happening simultaneously right now in the field and in Sacramento.

05:25:57.267 --> 05:26:02.632
They're a very dedicated and hardworking group of commissioners, so I want to acknowledge them publicly for that.

05:26:03.593 --> 05:26:03.893
Thank you.

05:26:04.393 --> 05:26:07.335
Do you want to have any update on the Summer School for the Arts?

05:26:07.515 --> 05:26:08.595
Yes, thank you very much.

05:26:09.056 --> 05:26:22.282
The California State Summer School for the Arts will be celebrating its 31st year and the application is active now on the website and the deadline for submission is February 28th.

05:26:22.362 --> 05:26:31.246
So if for high school students or people who are going into high school, we encourage you to get your applications in by the deadline of February 28th.

05:26:32.839 --> 05:26:55.977
Okay, a footnote on the special ed on preview of coming attractions on November 29th, the Public Policy Institute of California will release its report on overhauling special education finance during the formulation of the local control funding initiative, special education finance, which

05:26:57.178 --> 05:27:04.929
it's quite a significant part of budgets, maybe 15% or more, was not addressed in that or in the subsequent legislation.

05:27:05.750 --> 05:27:12.218
And so some California foundations gave money to PPIC to do this study.

05:27:13.800 --> 05:27:20.345
It'll be interesting, and I think the latest term from Silicon Valley is disruptive will be.

05:27:21.486 --> 05:27:27.730
So that's to come, and I will speak at the unveiling at that time.

05:27:29.051 --> 05:27:31.313
Okay, CTC Strauss.

05:27:32.250 --> 05:27:46.605
So, on October 19th, Tom Adams, Deputy Superintendent, and myself, and Jose Gonzalez, who's the Superintendent sitting on the Credentialing Commission, participated at the California Deans Colleges of Education Conference.

05:27:46.685 --> 05:27:52.732
It's actually only the second year in about 20 or 25 years that the Deans of the Colleges of Education have been in the same room.

05:27:53.172 --> 05:27:54.674
Superintendent Torrekson was there last year.

05:27:55.134 --> 05:27:56.755
and we were the policy maker panel.

05:27:57.376 --> 05:28:22.297
It was very exciting talking about recruitment, how to engage young students and even in high school into college in their undergraduate years to be excited about teaching, how to inspire them, how to look at different pathways through community college, what skills we're gonna need in our new workforce in 2028, 2030 when our current little kindergartners are graduating and going on, what we need to do to help be relevant.

05:28:22.917 --> 05:28:39.891
We talked a lot about pre-service, and thanks to Tom Adams, a very strong suggestion that as you teach curriculum, we have free frameworks and materials on our website that would be wonderful in teacher preparation so that teachers entering our workforce would actually have been exposed to the most current frameworks.

05:28:41.412 --> 05:29:03.951
We talked a lot about needing to have a workforce that was reflective of our current student body, a lot about bridging the academic gap, restorative justice practices, which we talked about a little earlier today, and needing teachers to have skills to have students literate by third grade, on grade level, what we need for math skills, and just looking at the changes we're gonna need for teacher preparation.

05:29:04.011 --> 05:29:06.413
So it was a really exciting conference,

05:29:07.954 --> 05:29:18.601
I think you'll hear a little more about it, but it was just really a wonderful move ahead to what collaboratively we need to do in helping inspire and improve teaching practice.

05:29:19.361 --> 05:29:21.042
Then CTC met last week.

05:29:21.483 --> 05:29:22.403
Just a couple things.

05:29:23.244 --> 05:29:36.612
Thanks to the Science Teacher Association and a lot of our colleagues, there was a collaborative effort by CTC and the science community to update the subject matter requirements for elementary school to align within the legal requirements.

05:29:37.713 --> 05:29:48.902
to revise so that our cross-cutting concepts in science and engineering practice and disciplinary core ideas are integrated now, so it was really wonderful to appreciate all the collaboration there.

05:29:49.342 --> 05:30:01.653
Also, special ed induction program standards are updated, so we're gonna be talking a lot about the need to update special ed and the new skills that teachers will need with evidence-based practices to support students with differing needs.

05:30:02.713 --> 05:30:08.836
Also, there's an update on the administrative performance assessment on a pilot, and trying to update those as well.

05:30:08.876 --> 05:30:13.339
So just a lot of effort in those areas to align our practices.

05:30:13.379 --> 05:30:14.619
Those are a couple of highlights.

05:30:15.240 --> 05:30:19.842
And there was a literacy, so we'd all appreciate those of us who were committed to LAELD.

05:30:20.602 --> 05:30:31.188
Our writers, Nancy Bernelson and Hallie Sloak, did a presentation to the CTC, and they passed out our executive summaries of our frameworks.

05:30:31.608 --> 05:30:43.686
And so there was a great quote on their slide from our framework which says, the most promising futures await our students and our society when we ensure that all individuals acquire strong literacy and language skills in every discipline.

05:30:44.006 --> 05:30:46.189
So I thought that really says a lot of what we're about.

05:30:46.910 --> 05:30:48.230
Just two more things.

05:30:48.770 --> 05:30:55.892
The Concurrence Commission, which is our subject matter projects, have been pretty low funded, very limited budget, but I liaise onto that.

05:30:55.932 --> 05:31:01.173
There was a state conference the beginning of October at UCLA, and they were very, very interested.

05:31:01.213 --> 05:31:13.496
I spoke at lunch about where we're going with professional learning and improving practice, so of course they're very interested in ESSA and where we're going on that and would love to help be part of expanding the content support for building teacher capacity.

05:31:14.256 --> 05:31:26.642
And then just to support what we're talking about, social emotional learning, our state is now, lays onto this new group that CDE has applied and was part of seven states and 10 more are joining.

05:31:27.043 --> 05:31:33.486
We had our first meeting on Monday on social emotional learning and what that ought to be, where that ought to be as part of our practices.

05:31:33.946 --> 05:31:38.948
what are elements that we need to help students be fully competent as they graduate school.

05:31:39.048 --> 05:31:44.951
So we'll hear a lot more about it, but it was the first meeting and clearly trying to integrate all these concepts as well.

05:31:45.211 --> 05:31:45.551
Thank you.

05:31:46.432 --> 05:31:51.254
Do you want to comment on the federal teacher preparation regulations?

05:31:51.294 --> 05:31:53.195
Were you there for that talk or not?

05:31:54.996 --> 05:32:01.679
Okay, well I did confer with the chair of the CTC, Linda Darling-Hammond,

05:32:02.430 --> 05:32:14.739
And these are final regulations, and they have quite a bit of required teacher testing after teachers complete their program and go into the schools.

05:32:15.460 --> 05:32:27.029
So I would ask you to look into that and report back to the board on that, because there's, as she described, the new regulations for teacher preparation, there's quite a bit of overlap to our work.

05:32:27.589 --> 05:32:29.991
And this isn't just a teacher preparation work.

05:32:30.726 --> 05:32:38.391
So, um Yeah, and it's quite a controversial thing, and these air completed regulations.

05:32:39.251 --> 05:32:47.076
Um, not in that regard, so we would have to create a lot more testing to satisfy these federal regulations.

05:32:47.156 --> 05:32:53.000
So so we'll get a report on that next time, because I think that's in December, so I can get that.

05:32:53.640 --> 05:32:54.861
Yeah, December.

05:32:54.901 --> 05:32:55.821
That's what I mean.

05:32:56.282 --> 05:32:56.442
Yeah.

05:32:57.512 --> 05:33:01.075
December, no, our January meeting.

05:33:01.115 --> 05:33:01.395
Yeah.

05:33:01.635 --> 05:33:01.956
Okay.

05:33:02.076 --> 05:33:02.276
Yeah.

05:33:02.556 --> 05:33:02.796
All right.

05:33:02.916 --> 05:33:03.117
Good.

05:33:03.677 --> 05:33:03.997
Okay.

05:33:04.057 --> 05:33:07.200
Finally, the CCEE member Burr.

05:33:09.131 --> 05:33:09.532
Thank you.

05:33:09.612 --> 05:33:11.513
I'll start with our October meeting.

05:33:11.653 --> 05:33:15.296
At our October meeting, we approved the professional development plan.

05:33:15.596 --> 05:33:23.362
You recall that the collaborative was awarded about $24 million in the budget to do the capacity building we talked a lot about this morning.

05:33:24.243 --> 05:33:26.585
So we approved the major professional development plan.

05:33:26.945 --> 05:33:29.747
The first piece of that is happening as we speak.

05:33:30.268 --> 05:33:34.171
The first training is taking place over at the convention center.

05:33:35.091 --> 05:33:41.454
But there are nine total workshops up and down the state between now and November 19th.

05:33:42.214 --> 05:33:52.399
If you go on the collaborative website and click on workshops and trainings, it lists all the trainings, but there's also a link to the actual PowerPoint, all 152 slides of it.

05:33:54.620 --> 05:33:57.783
So if people were asking about how does this all fit together?

05:33:57.803 --> 05:34:01.786
I think if you look at that slide deck, you'll have a very good sense of that.

05:34:01.846 --> 05:34:02.646
So it's very helpful.

05:34:03.827 --> 05:34:06.509
It's a good resource for people who are interested in looking at that.

05:34:07.510 --> 05:34:17.077
So also at the October meeting, as part of this overall capacity building, we also approved around 40 early adopter peer-to-peer networks.

05:34:17.157 --> 05:34:18.198
Those are intended to be

05:34:18.698 --> 05:34:30.567
sort of one level down from the workshops where, and mostly in the early adopters, the counties are organizing their districts in the county to have these ongoing discussions about how do you use the rubrics?

05:34:30.607 --> 05:34:31.408
What does that mean?

05:34:31.448 --> 05:34:34.110
What do we do with this new LCAP template?

05:34:34.150 --> 05:34:36.032
So we approved those as well.

05:34:36.752 --> 05:34:39.134
We also approved four pilot districts.

05:34:39.254 --> 05:34:41.236
Turns out three districts in one county

05:34:41.796 --> 05:34:59.431
who really want to get into the deeper work where they will be, the CCEE staff, will be working right alongside those districts to provide the technical assistance and support that they need, and that we'll be trying out that we will then have available in subsequent years.

05:34:59.491 --> 05:35:04.916
The three districts are Sausalito, Marin City, Palo Verde, which is in Riverside County,

05:35:05.993 --> 05:35:15.521
Woodland Unified, which is over here in Yolo County, and then the Kern County superintendent actually volunteered to be a pilot for all the districts within her county.

05:35:15.641 --> 05:35:20.244
So lots of work going on with CCE right now.

05:35:20.665 --> 05:35:21.886
Our next meeting is December 1st.

05:35:23.447 --> 05:35:31.831
and we will be meeting in San Francisco at San Francisco Unified, and we're doing that in collaboration with the CSBA meeting.

05:35:32.271 --> 05:35:45.118
And related to CCE work, and obviously the work I'm doing here, I'm on a panel at the AXA annual conference next week, and then at the CSBA annual conference in December.

05:35:46.914 --> 05:35:49.836
Okay, uh, so we're obviously running ahead of schedule.

05:35:49.876 --> 05:35:50.617
No, no, sorry.

05:35:50.777 --> 05:35:52.058
One more.

05:35:52.158 --> 05:35:53.019
I have two more.

05:35:53.099 --> 05:36:10.852
These are, uh, you know, that one of the other elements that people weren't talking about yet, but they soon will be, uh, the elementary, every student succeed that added a requirement for state for leas to collect information about students who are military family members.

05:36:10.892 --> 05:36:13.014
So that identifier has to be added.

05:36:13.513 --> 05:36:20.236
That's something the legislature has been trying to work on adding to as an update to our CALPADS system.

05:36:20.297 --> 05:36:21.597
Now it's become a requirement.

05:36:21.937 --> 05:36:26.240
There is confusion about whether or not that is going to be a student subgroup.

05:36:26.320 --> 05:36:26.960
No, it's not.

05:36:27.360 --> 05:36:28.921
But that is a requirement.

05:36:28.961 --> 05:36:40.887
I bring that up because the other liaison capacity requirement function that I have is I serve for this board on California State Council, the interstate compact for educational opportunity for military children.

05:36:40.927 --> 05:36:42.128
We had a meeting yesterday.

05:36:42.708 --> 05:36:44.009
here in this department.

05:36:44.810 --> 05:36:46.551
Just a couple of things that are going on.

05:36:46.591 --> 05:36:48.773
There is a new executive director now.

05:36:48.893 --> 05:36:54.337
Her name is Sharice Imai, and her term began on June 1st.

05:36:54.697 --> 05:36:56.959
She's replacing Kate Gavlock.

05:36:57.099 --> 05:37:03.544
Kate Gavlock is a superintendent at Travis Unified School District, and Kate had been serving in that capacity up till then.

05:37:03.944 --> 05:37:11.910
I'm sure she's very happy to give up that responsibility, but Kate has represented California and the commission very, very well.

05:37:12.430 --> 05:37:26.661
The commission's work continues to be to look at all the issues that relate to all the states for students that come into our schools or transfer from our schools to schools in other states to make sure that they have an easy transition.

05:37:27.262 --> 05:37:34.868
When I began this assignment, we had about 25 to 30 states, including California, that were part of the commission's work.

05:37:35.328 --> 05:37:41.090
Now the interstate compact covers all 50 states, and all 50 states have a commission and have commissioners.

05:37:41.270 --> 05:37:59.956
Our next meeting is in April, April 25th in San Diego, and we're being hosted by a local school district, but there will be members from both the military installations down there who will be part of the work that we'll be doing, and I'll come back to report that.

05:38:00.376 --> 05:38:16.404
The second thing I also want to report to you is you may recall with the permission of the board president, I've been working with the Smarter Balanced Consortium to develop an online interface for a teacher guide concerning the Smarter Balanced assessments.

05:38:16.964 --> 05:38:29.370
We've been having regular conference calls each Thursday just to work with the computer engineers and all those people who do the programming stuff to work out all the nuts and bolts for the online activities.

05:38:29.870 --> 05:38:45.505
But the next big phase is they're actually convening a survey, a group of folks to participate in a survey to talk about what the logic model will be to look at what the end user interface will look like and how to build this idea about this online workbook.

05:38:45.965 --> 05:38:46.706
for teachers.

05:38:47.126 --> 05:39:09.241
And so again, I want to emphasize this is a model that Smarter Balanced intends to scale up for all the consortium states to have access to, but they have contracted in a very large way with a number of design team members on the design team in multiple states to put together this idea of this online workbook based on feedback they received from California teachers.

05:39:09.261 --> 05:39:10.102
So the project

05:39:10.782 --> 05:39:13.703
They hope to bring it to scale and implement it at some point this spring.

05:39:14.104 --> 05:39:20.766
They have initiated a very aggressive and I would say very, very impressive group of folks to put this together.

05:39:20.786 --> 05:39:21.867
So it's very exciting work.

05:39:23.268 --> 05:39:26.269
Okay, thank you for those additions and one more, yeah.

05:39:28.857 --> 05:39:38.625
Okay, so the Child Nutrition Advisory Board had two vacancies, one for teacher, one for curriculum coordinator, and today they were appointed, so then now they have a full board.

05:39:39.566 --> 05:39:49.794
They have been very proactive in trying to make sure that they have a good understanding of the nutrition and fitness standards, and for that reason, they invited the CDE to present on the health framework.

05:39:50.534 --> 05:39:56.640
I will be attending the meeting on November 29th in Long Beach Unified around the health framework.

05:39:57.000 --> 05:40:02.585
And one of the things that I want to make sure that I voice is the mental health piece that students brought up today.

05:40:02.765 --> 05:40:06.869
I think that's, I'm not sure if that's already part of the standards, but I think that's critical for us to discuss.

05:40:07.990 --> 05:40:21.745
They also presented on the September 12th meeting the newly revised CDE Nutrition Education Resource Guide, and that's really aimed at bringing some effective practices around fitness and nutrition, K-12, to the schools.

05:40:23.086 --> 05:40:23.987
So that's CNAC.

05:40:24.687 --> 05:40:31.970
I will also be part of the EL Blueprint workgroup that's meeting next week, November 10th, here in Sacramento.

05:40:32.030 --> 05:40:34.151
So I want to thank the department for that invitation.

05:40:35.331 --> 05:40:37.172
And let's see, there was one more thing.

05:40:38.472 --> 05:40:40.573
Can't remember, so I guess it wasn't all that important.

05:40:41.614 --> 05:40:41.874
Thanks.

05:40:43.795 --> 05:40:46.316
Okay, no more reports.

05:40:48.037 --> 05:40:52.619
We can take up today, since we have time, the regular proposed consent calendar.

05:40:53.259 --> 05:40:55.060
That's our items 11 through 17.

05:40:55.160 --> 05:41:01.123
So I can... So move.

05:41:04.645 --> 05:41:05.385
Is there a second?

05:41:06.913 --> 05:41:07.914
Is there public comment?

05:41:08.655 --> 05:41:08.816
No.

05:41:08.836 --> 05:41:09.136
Okay.

05:41:09.596 --> 05:41:11.819
All those in favor of regular public consent?

05:41:11.899 --> 05:41:12.440
All right.

05:41:13.080 --> 05:41:22.471
And finally, do we have anybody who wants to address the board under general public comment on items that are not part of our agenda?

05:41:24.838 --> 05:41:27.921
And we'll also do that tomorrow as well.

05:41:28.162 --> 05:41:29.603
No, we cannot do waiver consent.

05:41:29.944 --> 05:41:30.724
I have an observation.

05:41:31.025 --> 05:41:32.727
Okay, you have an observation.

05:41:33.808 --> 05:41:38.012
Fantastic levels of involvement you all have and various committees you're representing.

05:41:38.052 --> 05:41:40.535
I see you all over the state and various conferences.

05:41:40.595 --> 05:41:44.619
I don't know, sometimes I think you clone yourselves, but you're doing great, great work there.

05:41:45.160 --> 05:41:46.281
The observation is that

05:41:47.722 --> 05:41:55.528
You said we were running ahead of schedule, and I want to say I think that's due to the really hard work, great teamwork between your staff and CDE staff.

05:41:56.209 --> 05:42:06.637
I know Dave working with, you know, Jeff, Cindy, Barbara working on sort of big chunks of work, complicated the evaluation rubrics today, the LCAP.

05:42:07.217 --> 05:42:10.778
the ESSA planning, and again, it's great teamwork.

05:42:10.898 --> 05:42:22.721
All the workshops, all the meetings, convening of stakeholders, involving practitioners, resulted in no overflow crowds, but really great reports and great momentum.

05:42:22.741 --> 05:42:31.064
So I just wanted to commend the staff, your staff, all of them involved, Jeff, Cindy, and Barbara, who sort of led the three major efforts today for CDE.

05:42:34.936 --> 05:42:42.343
I was remiss in my STEM report in not mentioning CDE's STEM conference last month, and I apologize.

05:42:42.464 --> 05:42:43.064
I was there.

05:42:43.625 --> 05:42:48.309
I did a presentation where I hosted, organized and hosted, moderated a presentation.

05:42:48.569 --> 05:42:52.013
I don't have a computer science background, so I don't do the computer science part of it.

05:42:52.433 --> 05:43:01.076
But we had Alice Steinglass from Code.org, she's vice president of engineering, and three educators who are implementing computer science in their schools.

05:43:01.256 --> 05:43:06.498
And we had a large room, it was completely full, there were lots of questions.

05:43:06.958 --> 05:43:14.641
CDE does a wonderful job with this STEM conference, it's been a real hit, superintendent, and it was really packed.

05:43:15.401 --> 05:43:23.807
and the CDE staff were really supportive of me pulling this together and getting it organized.

05:43:23.867 --> 05:43:24.888
It made it very smooth.

05:43:24.948 --> 05:43:26.689
I really enjoyed it, so thank you.

05:43:28.911 --> 05:43:31.413
And we have one speaker for public comment when you're ready.

05:43:31.673 --> 05:43:32.854
First, Board Member Sisson.

05:43:34.999 --> 05:43:41.762
I just wanted to generally say thank you to the board for listening so intently to the speeches that we heard this morning from the CAS conference.

05:43:42.623 --> 05:43:53.488
I worked really hard and all of the delegates worked extremely, extremely, extremely hard to create these proposals that we're so excited that they're considering implementing.

05:43:53.548 --> 05:43:59.691
So just on behalf of the students and the delegates and myself, I want to thank you guys for your attention to those matters.

05:44:01.077 --> 05:44:10.081
After hearing if some of it was done at 2.30 a.m., I'm even more impressed, particularly at my age.

05:44:11.001 --> 05:44:13.042
Sorry, Doug, one related comment.

05:44:13.382 --> 05:44:16.083
So Olivia's birthday was on Monday.

05:44:16.404 --> 05:44:25.387
She turned 18 and was here working with students, so I just want to thank you for your dedication and working through your work, your birthday, and happy birthday.

05:44:25.427 --> 05:44:26.648
We're so glad we have a new voter.

05:44:28.005 --> 05:44:28.387
Thank you.

05:44:32.142 --> 05:44:34.063
Okay, Bob, comment?

05:44:34.183 --> 05:44:36.144
Hi, I'm Doug McCray, retired testing.

05:44:36.204 --> 05:44:40.246
I just want to mention I submitted a handout on your general public comment.

05:44:40.686 --> 05:44:49.410
It's the latest version of the 2016 consortia state by state comparisons document that I've been doing the last couple of months.

05:44:50.170 --> 05:44:57.934
All the state results from 2016 are in except for New Hampshire, but that's in your electronic folder if anybody's interested.

05:44:59.735 --> 05:45:01.756
Okay, well, the board will recess till tomorrow.
