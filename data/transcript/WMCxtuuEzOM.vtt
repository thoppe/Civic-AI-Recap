WEBVTT

00:02.065 --> 00:10.751
The State Board will be called to order and for our day session and the first item today is a waiver consent calendar.

00:11.712 --> 00:14.734
We have on consent waivers one through 17.

00:14.954 --> 00:18.817
We will present 18 separately.

00:19.598 --> 00:24.581
So I'm looking for discussion or a motion on waivers one through 17.

00:27.928 --> 00:28.268
I move.

00:29.029 --> 00:29.429
Go ahead.

00:30.089 --> 00:30.430
Go ahead.

00:31.730 --> 00:32.471
I move the consent.

00:32.511 --> 00:33.392
I'll second.

00:33.752 --> 00:37.034
Moved by Board Member Holiday, seconded by Board Member Burr.

00:38.315 --> 00:39.856
Is there any public comment on these?

00:41.196 --> 00:42.857
There is public comment on 18.

00:42.897 --> 00:45.959
Yeah, I'm on 1 through 17.

00:46.019 --> 00:46.620
Sorry.

00:47.860 --> 00:48.121
All right.

00:48.201 --> 00:49.161
No public comment.

00:49.241 --> 00:51.443
Is there any board discussion on these items?

00:52.984 --> 00:54.905
If not, all those in favor, raise your hands.

00:55.751 --> 00:57.252
We're going to need a unanimous vote.

00:57.312 --> 00:57.693
We do.

00:57.713 --> 00:58.353
Okay.

00:58.954 --> 00:59.334
Waiver 18.

00:59.374 --> 01:06.520
We're going to have a presentation from the State Department of Education by Cindy Chan.

01:18.752 --> 01:21.733
Good morning, Board President Kerr, Superintendent Torlakson, members of the board.

01:22.433 --> 01:25.433
I was, I think I'm just doing an update on the errata.

01:25.493 --> 01:31.915
If you want me to present the entire waiver, I can, but I was just going to point out a couple of... Yeah, just the errata.

01:31.955 --> 01:32.255
Okay.

01:32.575 --> 01:40.896
So for waiver 18 and waiver 19, there are some things that you need to consider when, in this one, because it affects the recommendation.

01:41.016 --> 01:42.397
So for waiver 18 only,

01:45.402 --> 02:03.734
In attachment one, specifically for waiver request 16-12-2016, which is a request from Mottol Unified School District on behalf of Mottol Valley Charter, Eureka City Schools should be added as a district of location for the following resource centers.

02:03.874 --> 02:09.057
And Mottol actually requested a waiver for eight resource centers, but only three are affected.

02:09.077 --> 02:14.321
We're asking that you add Eureka City Schools as a district of location for

02:15.041 --> 02:25.167
the resource centers at 1539 F Street, Arcata, 2020 Campton Road, Eureka, and 2120 Campton Road, Eureka.

02:26.388 --> 02:34.313
And then for both Waiver 18 and Waiver 19, in the recommendation section, the CD is actually recommending

02:34.893 --> 02:43.697
five conditions and that was reflective in the waiver policy that you adopted in March, but only four of them made it into the item.

02:43.797 --> 02:48.379
So we are asking that you add the fifth condition and I'll just read it.

02:48.499 --> 02:57.204
If the authorizer has not visited the Resource Center identified in Attachment 1 pursuant to Education Code Section 47604.32, Subdivision A, Paragraph 2,

03:00.505 --> 03:04.909
require the authorizer to visit the resource centers within a reasonable time frame.

03:05.309 --> 03:09.533
So those are the two errata that you need to add to your recommendation.

03:09.593 --> 03:28.369
And just for clarification, I just want to state for waiver 18 only, this is just to clarify, attachment is correct, but for waiver request 37-12-2016, there was some correspondence sent in because I think there was some confusion on what the district was actually requesting.

03:28.829 --> 03:32.890
and it's because they sent in two letters and both letters were posted to the website.

03:33.650 --> 03:47.633
So what Whitmore Union Elementary School District is asking on behalf of Northern Summit Academy is requesting a waiver for one resource center at 2877 Childress Avenue or excuse me Childress Drive in Anderson.

03:48.674 --> 03:54.435
And that is correct in the attachment but in the letters there was a lot of

03:54.975 --> 03:55.935
verbiage in there.

03:56.175 --> 03:59.417
And in the end, they really only wanted the one resource center.

03:59.437 --> 04:03.058
So it's just clarification purposes, mainly for you and for the public.

04:03.658 --> 04:04.418
And that's it.

04:04.799 --> 04:06.519
If you have any questions, I can answer them.

04:07.199 --> 04:08.700
Public comment on this item.

04:13.402 --> 04:14.222
Come forward, please.

04:18.809 --> 04:35.075
Megan Macy with Lozano Smith here today representing Anderson Union High School District, Cascade Elementary District related to the Northern Summit Waiver and Redding and Shasta High School District related to the New Day Academy Waiver both submitted by Whitmore Elementary.

04:37.425 --> 04:45.610
It's the position and there were letters submitted, hopefully you've had a chance to look at those, that these should be taken off the consent calendar and addressed individually.

04:46.130 --> 04:53.855
There are some significant concerns related to the waivers themselves and there's opposition by all four of the school districts.

04:54.295 --> 05:02.901
Fundamentally, neither of the waivers were appropriately approved by Whitmore in an open public meeting pursuant to the Brown Act.

05:03.841 --> 05:10.124
And we also don't believe that either of the facilities at issue in the waivers were already existing and operating.

05:10.204 --> 05:12.225
We have correspondence to that effect from the district.

05:12.625 --> 05:14.466
So these are essentially new facilities.

05:15.026 --> 05:20.929
So we would ask that these be taken off the consent calendar and addressed individually.

05:21.049 --> 05:21.349
Thank you.

05:26.272 --> 05:27.152
Next public comment.

05:30.011 --> 05:40.217
Good morning, I'm Jeff Rice with the A Plus Personalized Learning Network Association representing 60 personalized learning public charter schools serving 60,000 K-12 students throughout the state of California.

05:40.858 --> 05:58.009
We're here to express our appreciation to the staff's excellent work on these waiver requests and that we are in support of the staff recommendations to approve these waivers with the conditions as stated and would appreciate your yes vote and support as well.

05:58.189 --> 05:58.489
Thank you.

06:03.294 --> 06:06.595
Lisa Corr with Young Medine Corr here on behalf of New Day Academy.

06:07.015 --> 06:12.297
I just wanted to let you know New Day did submit a response on Friday to the letters by Lozano-Smith.

06:12.757 --> 06:19.940
They did have, in fact, an existing facility that was providing special education support and testing centers for students.

06:20.660 --> 06:24.161
Then Lozano-Smith sent them a cease and desist in a threat of a lawsuit.

06:24.521 --> 06:25.942
They held operation

06:27.542 --> 06:31.884
for the time being, they postponed operation there while they submitted the waiver.

06:32.564 --> 06:36.926
And now Lozano Smith is using that basis as a reason to ask that you not grant the waiver.

06:37.447 --> 06:41.549
We'd like the year to transition those centers appropriately.

06:42.229 --> 06:46.871
We need the year so that we can submit locally to Shasta Union High School District and that is our plan to do so.

06:47.251 --> 06:48.052
Thank you very much.

06:48.152 --> 06:54.675
And also just want to let you know that I am aware that there was a publicly held meeting at the district to consider the waiver.

06:54.775 --> 06:55.115
Thank you.

07:03.550 --> 07:04.711
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

07:04.731 --> 07:05.971
My name is Adam Ferber.

07:06.151 --> 07:17.677
I represent the Visalia Unified School District and the Tulare Joint Union High School District with respect to the waiver request attachments 46 and 47 of your agenda.

07:18.558 --> 07:22.760
And I would, on behalf of the districts, I would like essentially to make the same argument that Ms.

07:22.800 --> 07:31.805
Macy made, and that is that the Stone Corral Elementary School District that is seeking the waiver did not hold a public hearing in advance

07:33.165 --> 07:34.146
of their waiver request.

07:34.206 --> 07:39.788
And for that reason, we also request that the items be removed from the consent calendar and discussed.

07:39.968 --> 07:40.288
Thank you.

07:47.091 --> 07:50.452
Eric Premack, Charter Schools Development Centre, in support of all of the waivers.

07:50.672 --> 07:50.932
Thank you.

07:53.208 --> 07:53.548
Okay.

07:54.129 --> 07:56.752
Is there any further board discussion on this?

07:56.853 --> 08:00.737
If we have a motion, it would have to include somehow the comments made by CDE.

08:00.958 --> 08:07.426
So we could call that the CDE recommendation, I think, as amended by Cindy Chan.

08:11.591 --> 08:12.312
Board Member Rucker.

08:12.659 --> 08:28.972
Well, first of all, I want to begin with saying you may recall at the last board meeting in March where the board approved a policy to address the transition of these centers in settlement and in implementing a court decision.

08:29.353 --> 08:32.095
There was a lot of concern and not only about the timeline,

08:33.404 --> 08:36.446
but about how the process would work to create a transition.

08:36.506 --> 08:53.436
So I believe we did the work in March to create both a process and a waiver process that would allow for a very smooth transition with a reasonable amount of time for these centers to work with the LEAs and the districts that they would be collaborating with for these services.

08:54.332 --> 09:07.641
What we have in front of us today is a collection of waivers that have, that were submitted in support, in recognition of and in compliance with the waiver policy that we put in place in March.

09:09.041 --> 09:23.471
I want to let you know that the staff did a lot of work in both contacting the centers and in working with the districts, not only to understand the location issues, but to make sure that due diligence was exercised in the execution of these waivers.

09:24.437 --> 09:37.025
The changes that were requested by Cindy were simply just, were simply the additions to make sure that all the conditions related to the approval of these waivers would be met based on our policy.

09:37.545 --> 09:54.075
So today I'm going to recommend that a motion that we approve the waivers that are on the consent calendar with the addition of the information that was provided by Cindy to add the additional fifth condition as aligned to our waiver policy.

09:55.996 --> 09:56.336
Okay.

09:56.396 --> 09:57.636
Is there a second on that?

09:57.977 --> 09:58.577
All right.

09:58.837 --> 10:00.237
Any further board discussion?

10:01.398 --> 10:03.318
If not, those in favor, all raise your hands.

10:03.798 --> 10:04.178
Okay.

10:04.218 --> 10:05.559
Those waivers are completed.

10:06.579 --> 10:10.480
So now we are down to item 16.

10:10.620 --> 10:12.781
This is a... W21.

10:13.681 --> 10:15.001
Pardon?

10:15.781 --> 10:15.841
W21.

10:15.942 --> 10:16.222
W21.

10:16.402 --> 10:16.582
Okay.

10:17.782 --> 10:18.342
On my sheet.

10:18.822 --> 10:19.122
All right.

10:19.462 --> 10:21.123
Who is presenting on that?

10:30.882 --> 10:35.365
Good morning again, Cindy Chan, Director of the Charter Schools Division at the California Department of Education.

10:36.306 --> 10:52.577
Item 21 or W21 includes requests by the Dehesa Elementary School District on behalf of two charter schools to allow these non-classroom based charter schools resource centers to operate outside of the boundaries of the authorizing school district but within the county.

10:53.858 --> 10:58.502
Again, I'm going to note that this one also needs to be added.

10:58.562 --> 11:00.803
The condition in the recommendation needs to be added.

11:00.823 --> 11:02.344
I'll kind of state it again at the end.

11:02.965 --> 11:08.709
But this one also needs that condition five about the authorizer visiting the Resource Center.

11:08.789 --> 11:12.512
So I'll add that in my recommendation towards the end of my presentation.

11:13.292 --> 11:15.614
Just a little background on this one.

11:15.995 --> 11:19.958
If you recall, Board Member Rucker mentioned the waiver policy in March.

11:20.438 --> 11:41.776
The background for that policy was that there was in January a third district court of appeals court opinion of the Anderson Union High School District versus Shasta Secondary Home School decision that became final that held that geographic restrictions in the specified statutes applied to non-classroom based charter schools operating resource centers.

11:42.456 --> 11:53.871
Thus, in order to ensure compliance with the court opinion, a non-classroom based charter school resource center must operate within the boundaries of its authorizing school district unless an exception applies.

11:54.571 --> 11:58.977
Additionally, the charter school may establish a resource center in an adjacent county.

11:59.978 --> 12:08.240
The major timing of the decision's final status, however, was thought to be problematic for some schools to come into immediate compliance this year.

12:08.280 --> 12:17.303
Thus, in March, the State Board approved Waiver Policy 17-01 entitled Non-Classroom Based Charter School Resource Center Location.

12:18.419 --> 12:27.967
Consistent with the State Board's policy, Dehesa Elementary School District and the two charter schools submitted the following information as detailed in Attachment 1.

12:28.988 --> 12:40.038
The address of each Resource Center, school district in which each Resource Center is located, date each Resource Center was established, and the number of students attending each Resource Center.

12:40.958 --> 12:45.983
Also for each Resource Center subject to the waiver request, discussion of the need for the waiver.

12:47.624 --> 12:52.026
CDE staff reviewed each waiver request and additional information provided.

12:52.627 --> 13:02.533
We limited the request in the item to only those that we determined provided responsive data and information pursuant to the waiver policy.

13:03.013 --> 13:08.876
However, in our review of the address of the resource center and the school district of location submitted,

13:10.057 --> 13:18.724
With the waiver request for these two schools, we determined that a school district of location was not identified for some of the resource centers.

13:19.484 --> 13:22.607
We reach out to the district a number of times.

13:22.867 --> 13:29.832
We had they had responded on a couple on a couple of occasions, but the last confirmation we didn't hear from them.

13:30.072 --> 13:34.256
And so we have added the other districts into the attachment.

13:34.816 --> 13:45.602
So specifically for waiver request 722017 Community Montessori Charter, the school is requesting a waiver for five resource centers.

13:46.162 --> 13:50.585
We have added a school district of location to the following resource center only.

13:51.245 --> 13:58.790
The one at 9580 Carlton Hills Boulevard in Santee, we are adding the Grossmont Union High School District.

14:00.010 --> 14:09.141
And for waiver request 3212-2016 for Dehesa Charter School, they are requesting a waiver for six resource centers.

14:09.221 --> 14:14.287
We have added a school district of location to the following four resource centers.

14:14.947 --> 14:21.931
At 367 La Vida Avenue in Encinitas, we're adding San Diego Union High School District.

14:22.551 --> 14:30.595
At 1441 Montiel Road, Suite 145 in Escondido, we're adding Escondido Union High School District.

14:31.395 --> 14:37.038
At 1800 North Broadway, Escondido, we have added Escondido Union High School District.

14:37.739 --> 14:44.182
And at 5305 Sweetwater Road in Bonita, we've added Chula Vista Elementary School Districts.

14:44.842 --> 14:49.405
The added districts are already noted in attachment one with a single asterisk.

14:50.386 --> 15:03.974
Since all of the school districts in question are within San Diego County, we have also added the San Diego County Office of Education as one of the LEAs that should receive the transition plan as noted with a double asterisk.

15:05.015 --> 15:16.285
We believe that the addition of the school districts and San Diego County Office of Education is prudent to ensure maximum transparency for the affected requests.

15:17.887 --> 15:22.791
So if you can please refer to attachment one in order for your consideration today.

15:23.752 --> 15:39.122
The CD is recommending that the request from Dehesa Elementary School District for each charter school and resource center identified in Attachment 1 and consistent with the State Board's Waiver Policy 1701 be approved with the following conditions.

15:40.282 --> 15:50.629
Number one, require each charter school's governing body to approve a transition plan that details how the charter school's resource centers will come into compliance with the Anderson Court decision.

15:51.629 --> 16:01.691
Two, pursuant to Education Code Section 33051B, each waiver shall expire on June 30th, 2018 and shall not be retroactive.

16:02.752 --> 16:18.395
Condition three, require each charter school to submit the transition plan to the authorizing school district, county office of education, and to all school districts identified in attachment one, where the resource centers are located within 30 days after approval of the waiver.

16:19.475 --> 16:24.137
Condition four, require each charter school to provide a status update to parents.

16:24.657 --> 16:30.218
And as noted earlier, this one isn't in the item, but we have also are adding condition five.

16:31.099 --> 16:35.880
If the authorizer has not visited the resource centers identified in attachment one.

16:36.400 --> 16:47.163
pursuant to Education Code Section 47604.32A.2 require the authorizer to visit the resource centers within a reasonable time frame.

16:47.183 --> 16:50.063
These conditions are all reflective of the waiver policy.

16:50.543 --> 16:52.144
So I can answer any questions you have.

16:52.684 --> 16:53.284
Not thank you.

16:56.445 --> 16:57.805
Any questions for Cindy?

17:00.446 --> 17:01.186
Board Member Rocker.

17:04.612 --> 17:05.012
Okay.

17:05.052 --> 17:05.252
Okay.

17:05.272 --> 17:06.533
Well, we may have public comment.

17:06.593 --> 17:07.033
I don't know.

17:07.153 --> 17:08.314
Is there public comment on this?

17:09.694 --> 17:09.955
Yes.

17:10.635 --> 17:17.458
Jeff Rice, Cecilia Ewing, Tony Brown, Laura Sylvester, Roland Young, and Terry Novak.

17:19.879 --> 17:21.320
Jeff Rice again with A+.

17:21.400 --> 17:26.542
We are in support of these waiver requests and urge your yes vote in support.

17:26.622 --> 17:26.902
Thank you.

17:34.085 --> 17:36.646
Eric Premack Charter Schools Development Center again in support.

17:36.706 --> 17:37.006
Thank you.

17:42.648 --> 17:43.108
Good morning.

17:43.408 --> 17:44.549
My name is Celia Ewing.

17:44.569 --> 17:46.429
I'm the School Director of Tehesa Charter School.

17:46.470 --> 17:47.450
Thank you for having us.

17:48.630 --> 17:54.933
I'm a Hispanic woman born in California, a product of the California public school system and raised by public school teachers.

17:55.633 --> 18:01.135
My mother wrote one of the first independent study master's degree programs granted by the University of California, Berkeley.

18:01.835 --> 18:08.237
Her master's degree granted in 1974 empowered teachers to diversify and personalize learning for students.

18:08.897 --> 18:19.061
The educational philosophy that I inherited from her promotes student-led learning and a promise that a solid education could and would lift families out of poverty.

18:19.881 --> 18:21.702
What has happened to the California dream?

18:22.282 --> 18:25.943
As educators, we know that instruction is not one size fits all.

18:26.424 --> 18:30.225
The charter school movement has been an effective path for thousands of students.

18:30.805 --> 18:34.647
In our current political climate, there are many misconceptions about charter schools.

18:35.527 --> 18:37.028
Our school is not for profit.

18:37.248 --> 18:43.012
We take all students and have a 10% special ed population comparable to the large districts in our county.

18:43.613 --> 18:46.194
We serve English learners, credit division students.

18:46.475 --> 18:47.615
Wow, that was fast.

18:47.996 --> 18:49.577
Thank you so much for your time.

18:49.957 --> 18:52.379
And I know you're all passionate about education, so thank you.

18:56.762 --> 19:01.185
Hi, my name is Tony Drown and I'm a regional manager for Dehesa Charter School.

19:02.040 --> 19:06.224
in Escondido and the educational facilitator for Ramon Balderas.

19:06.784 --> 19:13.770
Ramon came to Dehesa after leaving his local high school out of frustration and being discouraged by the environment.

19:14.610 --> 19:18.774
He felt teachers didn't care, the classes were so big, and he felt marginalized.

19:22.350 --> 19:23.990
and that the instruction was impersonal.

19:24.571 --> 19:31.772
As a result, Ramon fled to Mexico and told his parents, I'm not going back to school until you find me a different school.

19:32.853 --> 19:36.814
His parents, who spoke a little to no English, discovered DEHISA.

19:36.914 --> 19:41.875
We met to discuss the demands of an independent study program, and he agreed he could handle it.

19:42.335 --> 19:46.376
Ramon attended four classes a week offered at the Escondido Resource Center.

19:47.156 --> 19:51.397
to support him in his core subjects as he learned to take ownership of his learning.

19:51.477 --> 20:04.040
He developed projects, participated in community service, work study, and concurrently enrolled in community college to study emergency medical technology, Hispanic culture, and criminal justice.

20:04.200 --> 20:06.761
And he demonstrated a high level of achievement.

20:07.181 --> 20:13.822
After graduation, he landed a full-time job and tech support to save money to continue to go to college.

20:15.843 --> 20:16.063
Thank you.

20:22.324 --> 20:22.644
Sorry.

20:23.504 --> 20:24.785
Hi, my name is Laura Sylvester.

20:24.905 --> 20:33.808
I'm the founder and executive director of Good Dog Autism Companions, but most importantly, I am mom to Elliot, a 16-year-old, minimally verbal, autistic, beautiful boy.

20:34.328 --> 20:39.929
After five years of working with the Ocean Unified School District, we exhausted all resources.

20:40.109 --> 20:42.230
My son met one IEP goal in five years.

20:42.610 --> 20:44.591
We left and we found Dehesa Charter School.

20:45.131 --> 20:47.532
He wouldn't leave the house for the next two years.

20:47.592 --> 20:52.315
We worked with them in their individualized and openness to work with my son.

20:52.735 --> 20:54.536
Now he wakes up every Thursday morning.

20:54.616 --> 20:56.077
He says, let's go see Johnny.

20:56.397 --> 21:00.860
Johnny is his specialized education teacher at the Resource Center in Escondido.

21:01.220 --> 21:05.963
They worked on simple addition and subtraction and spelling of three words for years.

21:06.443 --> 21:11.946
Now he is working on content and managing education at his school age level and beyond.

21:12.346 --> 21:17.388
And this would never be possible without the open and individualized look at his education.

21:17.688 --> 21:20.910
So I'm asking you personally, do not close these resource centers.

21:20.950 --> 21:26.973
We will never leave Dehesa Charter School, but without the resource centers, my child will not get a fair and appropriate education.

21:27.353 --> 21:27.633
Thank you.

21:33.154 --> 21:33.554
Good morning.

21:33.594 --> 21:34.475
My name is Roland Young.

21:34.515 --> 21:36.638
I'm the school director at Community Montessori Charter School.

21:37.398 --> 21:46.007
As the CDE has just stated, we were pulled off the consent list because we did not notify Grossmont Union High School District of our Santee Resource Center.

21:46.368 --> 21:53.335
And I just wanted to explain real quickly the reason why we didn't include it is because our Resource Center in Santee only serves students up to grade six.

21:54.827 --> 21:56.248
Our research centers are not schools.

21:56.308 --> 22:00.630
They're labs of learning for students and their parents to access Montessori materials.

22:01.350 --> 22:05.972
Montessori method is an educational approach that most of our parents did not have access to.

22:07.513 --> 22:13.636
And it's still a very expensive approach that is only available in private schools.

22:14.056 --> 22:18.498
Without our resource centers to support our families, would we still be able to do our jobs to support our families?

22:18.538 --> 22:20.579
And the answer would be yes, but it would be difficult.

22:21.360 --> 22:22.121
more difficult.

22:22.181 --> 22:28.190
And our goal I feel as educators is to really give our families and our students access to education.

22:29.191 --> 22:35.921
Since our charter school does provides a countywide benefit to our entire county, our transition planning involves.

22:36.161 --> 22:37.002
Thank you very much for your time.

22:43.683 --> 22:44.083
Good morning.

22:44.103 --> 22:52.166
The manner in which we have operated for the last 15 years with the blessing of the CDE has now been determined out of compliance.

22:52.806 --> 22:57.108
So now we are tasked with the challenge of defining what a resource center is.

22:57.628 --> 23:00.489
And to my knowledge, there is no official definition.

23:01.349 --> 23:12.057
If what defines a resource center is the name on the lease or the mortgage, then you can forget all the addresses on the list because neither of the charter schools are on those leases.

23:12.837 --> 23:20.583
If you believe the resource center is one used for full-time instruction, again, you can forget all of those addresses because none of them are.

23:21.304 --> 23:27.828
If you define a resource center as a place which provides information, equipment, and support, then I need to go back to my office and I will give you

23:29.310 --> 23:31.452
document that will look like the yellow pages.

23:32.013 --> 23:41.945
Because for us, our resource centers are where our students gather to learn, be it restaurants, parks, community centers, senior homes, grocery stores, libraries, student homes, etc.

23:42.505 --> 23:48.072
If you want to shut down all of our resource centers, you need to include Balboa Park Museum, San Diego Zoo,

23:49.393 --> 23:55.377
None of our regions and either charter school is large enough to be a standalone school and really should be a countywide benefit.

23:55.617 --> 24:01.581
Due to the politics of education in San Diego County, we would be denied without the option to appeal to the state.

24:02.362 --> 24:12.849
Please approve the waivers today and support AB 950, which will open up opportunities for countywide benefit charters and put our time and public funds back to the students, not legal firms.

24:13.189 --> 24:13.449
Thank you.

24:15.772 --> 24:17.775
Does that conclude the public testimony?

24:18.176 --> 24:24.825
Board Member Rucker, who was our liaison on these waivers.

24:25.461 --> 24:42.248
Okay, so again, I want to make sure in offering to this waiver on Waiver 21 that I again commend the staff for the work that was done, not only to reach out to the districts, but to also check in with and work through with each of the resource centers.

24:42.308 --> 24:46.309
And so they had a clear understanding of what all five conditions would be.

24:46.810 --> 24:52.412
The CDE is recommending approval of this waiver with the added conditions that were explained by Cindy.

24:53.852 --> 25:07.538
a copy to include a copy of the transition plan and to include the extra requirements for the fifth condition as well as to make sure that the plan is provided to each of the districts plus the county office.

25:07.958 --> 25:09.659
So I'm recommending approval of this waiver.

25:09.699 --> 25:10.459
That's my motion.

25:10.700 --> 25:10.900
Second.

25:10.920 --> 25:12.360
All right.

25:14.061 --> 25:16.302
Any further board discussion of these waivers?

25:18.092 --> 25:19.873
If not, those in favor, raise your hands.

25:21.094 --> 25:21.355
All right.

25:21.395 --> 25:22.896
That's unanimously approved.

25:24.377 --> 25:28.040
I'm advised we cannot begin the public hearing till nine o'clock.

25:29.681 --> 25:37.347
And so we will take a four minute break and resume promptly at nine.

25:40.169 --> 25:44.852
And we're going to come back with agenda item 16.

25:45.053 --> 25:45.833
Agenda item 16.

25:48.262 --> 25:48.462
Yes, 16.

25:49.663 --> 25:51.384
Okay, the board will reconvene.

25:51.404 --> 25:56.287
I have six members and I understand that we had a

25:58.229 --> 26:03.752
lack of clarity on our prior vote on one of the waiver issues.

26:03.852 --> 26:12.036
So the, we have gotten a corrected motion, which satisfies the legal conditions in a more precise way.

26:12.236 --> 26:20.020
And Board Member Rucker will read the amended motion to one we already approved to make sure it's legally precise.

26:20.680 --> 26:21.761
And she will read it now.

26:21.901 --> 26:24.282
And then we will ask for a revote.

26:26.483 --> 26:26.783
Thank you.

26:37.728 --> 26:38.168
Go ahead.

26:38.408 --> 26:38.668
Yeah.

26:39.188 --> 27:03.595
I'm moving a recommendation to approve Waiver 18 and Waiver 19 with the CDE recommendation, plus the ERATA that was noted and explained by department staff to include the correction of the Resource Center addresses and the districts that would be notified as part of the waiver transition process, plus the addition of the fifth condition of the waiver policy.

27:05.518 --> 27:05.878
Second.

27:05.998 --> 27:06.379
Second.

27:06.639 --> 27:06.979
All right.

27:07.940 --> 27:09.601
Any public comment on this motion?

27:09.621 --> 27:10.161
Do we need?

27:12.683 --> 27:14.905
Seeing none, all those in favor, raise your hands.

27:15.285 --> 27:15.705
Okay.

27:15.846 --> 27:18.808
It's now approved in an appropriate way.

27:18.968 --> 27:27.134
And so now we're ready for item 16, the charter school concerning the Grossmont Union High School District.

27:28.034 --> 27:32.518
And Cindy Chan will present for the board and the department.

27:37.472 --> 27:38.613
So good morning again.

27:38.773 --> 27:45.097
So we have six public hearings and all of them, each of them are very different.

27:45.758 --> 27:49.541
And so I'm going to present, there's a few quite long.

27:49.561 --> 27:57.606
This one is the only one of its kind today that's an establishment, which is the more common one that we usually present to you.

27:57.706 --> 27:58.207
So this is

27:59.067 --> 28:01.768
an establishment of a new school that was denied locally.

28:02.088 --> 28:14.312
So item 16 is an appeal by Grosmont Secondary School to establish a new charter school, which was denied by the Grosmont Union High School District and the San Diego County Board of Education.

28:15.052 --> 28:24.876
So pursuant to statute, petitioners for a charter school that had been denied at the local level may petition the State Board of Education for approval subject to certain conditions.

28:26.036 --> 28:33.282
The CDE staff have received the Grossmont petition on February 1st, 2017.

28:33.382 --> 28:36.625
We've reviewed the petition documents and all the information submitted.

28:37.686 --> 28:46.374
And based on this review, the CDE recommends that the State Board hold a public hearing and thereafter approve with technical amendments and one condition.

28:47.114 --> 28:57.678
the request to establish Grossmont under the oversight of the State Board for a five-year term effective July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2022.

28:58.939 --> 29:12.604
The department's recommendation includes the following condition that the Grossmont Secondary School Board shall approve and submit a balanced budget to the CDE, which includes a 5% reserve as required by the State Board,

29:13.204 --> 29:23.339
if the actual transfer of funds is not equivalent to the $600,000 of cash that is included in the Grossmont financial statements as presented with the charter petition.

29:23.399 --> 29:27.325
So I'll give you a little bit more detail on that toward the end of my presentation.

29:28.823 --> 29:42.421
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools considered the Grossmont Petition at its April 5th meeting and unanimously voted to approve CDE's recommendation that the State Board approve the Grossmont Petition with the technical amendments and condition proposed by the CDE.

29:44.023 --> 30:01.488
Grossmont will provide an independent study homeschool setting with a focus on providing personalized and rigorous academic experience for its pupils, hire, develop, and maintain a highly qualified faculty and staff, and provide a supportive and safe environment.

30:02.508 --> 30:13.617
Grossmount proposes to serve 360 pupils in grade 7 through grade 12 in 2017-18, its first year of operation, expanding to 520 pupils in grade 7 through grade 12 in 2020-21, fourth year of operation, in an independent study homeschool program.

30:25.026 --> 30:39.785
Grossmont proposes to operate three resource centers located within the boundaries of the Grossmont Union High School District that currently operate under the Charter School of San Diego, a charter school authorized by the San Diego Unified School District.

30:40.866 --> 30:54.358
So as noted in the earlier discussion of the waivers resulting from the Anderson decision, in order to ensure compliance with the court opinion, a charter school resource center must operate within the boundaries of its authorizing school district.

30:54.398 --> 30:56.320
So that's the case for this one.

30:56.740 --> 31:05.248
This is an existing resource center program that's operated by another charter school in order to come into compliance with Anderson.

31:07.010 --> 31:13.580
providing a petition to Grossmont in order for that resource center to be compliant and continue to operate within the district boundaries.

31:15.222 --> 31:21.131
So the petition was submitted to Grossmont in October 2016 and was denied and then moved forward on appeal.

31:22.768 --> 31:35.635
We reviewed the gross MUT petition and supporting documents and find that it meets the standard and criteria requirements and provides a reasonably comprehensive description of the required elements with our recommended technical amendments.

31:36.435 --> 31:43.619
And looking at the budget, we reviewed the multi-year fiscal plan, which we note included unsubstantiated resources.

31:43.659 --> 31:49.122
So specifically a $600,000 beginning cash balance with no details or narrative.

31:49.242 --> 31:50.043
And just to note,

31:50.863 --> 32:03.814
On when we do our fiscal review, we do an independent review of the budget and we use assumptions and on how we look at the fiscal, different fiscal documents.

32:04.375 --> 32:07.197
We typically exclude what we would call soft money.

32:08.198 --> 32:16.407
So things that aren't entitlements, things that are unsubstantiated resources as this could inflate the charter school's financial position.

32:16.447 --> 32:20.551
So we have a more, I think, a little more conservative approach to the budget usually.

32:21.472 --> 32:29.760
For Grossmont, excluding the cash reduces their projected reserves and fund balance to a level that's not fiscally viable for the first year of operation.

32:30.661 --> 32:57.299
So in response to that, before the ACCS meeting on March 30th, the Board of Student Success Programs Incorporated, which is a DBA for Adeo Charter School, the Charter School of San Diego, and Laurel Preparatory Academy, approved a resolution that upon confirmation of the listed resource center's positive net balance of funds and the granting of a duly authorized charter petition,

32:57.919 --> 33:01.945
Gross amount shall receive no less than roughly 1.4 million dollars.

33:03.066 --> 33:14.982
We find that the condition which we have actually modified from the ACCS item, it was a little stronger and we've modified it now to kind of recognize this board resolution in part.

33:16.422 --> 33:20.063
But we still feel that the condition we're proposing is necessary.

33:20.763 --> 33:34.267
It's because the transfer of funds we find is contingent on both the granting of a charter petition and also that the positive net balance of funds from the Charter School of San Diego's resource centers must be confirmed.

33:34.947 --> 33:45.117
In a review of the Charter School of San Diego's prior year annual financial audit report, the individual resource centers are not identified separately, only the charter school as a whole.

33:45.217 --> 33:51.243
So even the audit doesn't recognize the resource centers as separate entities from the school.

33:52.524 --> 34:04.106
Confirmation of the net balance of Charter School San Diego's funds for the period ending June 30th of the current year would be confirmed presumably after the end of the current fiscal year.

34:04.746 --> 34:10.448
And additionally, if Grossmont is approved by the State Board, the effective date of the Charter School begins July 1, 2017.

34:11.048 --> 34:17.669
Thus, Charter School does not exist for the transfer of funds to occur at this time or prior to that date.

34:18.209 --> 34:38.573
So for the purpose of fiscal prudence, the department's recommending the condition requiring the Grossmont Board to approve and submit a balanced budget to the department that includes a 5% reserve if the actual transfer of funds is not equivalent to the $600,000 cash that's included in the Grossmont financial statements.

34:39.674 --> 34:44.157
In summary, we find that the Grossmont petition is consistent with sound educational practice.

34:44.758 --> 34:53.023
The petition provides a reasonably comprehensive description of the multiple required elements, noting that some do require a technical amendment.

34:54.224 --> 35:08.294
However, we did note that we find that Grossmont may not be demonstrably likely to successfully implement the program because it's not clear that the financial plan presented by the petitioner includes a sufficient reserve in the first year of operation.

35:09.194 --> 35:17.458
As I've noted, the first year budget is dependent on the transfer of cash, which may not be confirmed and may not occur until after the end of the current fiscal year.

35:17.598 --> 35:28.524
So therefore, we recommend that you hold a public hearing and approve the petition to establish Grossmont under the oversight of the State Board with the proposed condition and technical amendments.

35:29.024 --> 35:33.326
I believe the petitioner, the district and the county are here to address the Board.

35:34.027 --> 35:35.468
I can answer any questions you have.

35:35.928 --> 35:36.188
Thank you.

35:37.699 --> 35:37.939
Okay.

35:37.999 --> 35:39.441
Are there technical questions?

35:39.481 --> 35:45.709
The way we run these hearings is that we first hear from Cindy, as she just did.

35:45.829 --> 35:48.312
Then we have technical questions from the board.

35:49.153 --> 35:52.457
Then we open the public hearing for 10 minutes of each side.

35:53.211 --> 35:58.755
Then we hear the public comment after the public hearing and then we deliberate on our decision.

35:58.875 --> 36:10.844
So are there technical questions here that from our presentation that anybody would like to clarify just to make sure we understand what she said?

36:12.742 --> 36:13.322
Hearing none.

36:13.482 --> 36:13.842
Okay.

36:13.922 --> 36:18.684
Then I'm going to declare the public hearing open.

36:19.845 --> 36:24.086
Both sides have 10 minutes.

36:24.306 --> 36:27.988
And so we'll start with the Grossmont.

36:28.508 --> 36:32.729
You're the group that is submitting the petition, right?

36:33.169 --> 36:33.530
Correct.

36:33.630 --> 36:34.050
Correct.

36:34.430 --> 36:36.391
So you'll begin and then we'll have the opponents.

36:36.411 --> 36:37.471
We'll have 10 minutes later.

36:44.239 --> 36:47.982
Good morning, President Kerr, Superintendent Torlakson and board members.

36:48.142 --> 36:51.846
My name is Wade Ashbrenner and I am the lead petitioner for the Grossmont Secondary School.

36:52.387 --> 36:57.351
I'd first like to thank the CDE staff and ACCS for their recommendation to approve this charter.

36:59.553 --> 37:03.978
We agree to the technical amendment and have put a process in place to cure the one condition.

37:05.192 --> 37:14.417
The Grossmont Secondary School was developed as part of a comprehensive compliance plan and the petition was submitted in September of 2016 to the Grossmont Union High School District.

37:16.638 --> 37:17.558
Is the slide advancing?

37:20.480 --> 37:20.740
Okay.

37:21.320 --> 37:22.741
I can't really tell where it is.

37:26.459 --> 37:26.879
Let me see here.

37:27.139 --> 37:27.419
There we go.

37:27.899 --> 37:28.100
All right.

37:28.200 --> 37:28.500
Thank you.

37:29.940 --> 37:34.982
As I said, all three resource centers contained within the petition are in the boundaries of the Grossmont Union High School District.

37:35.182 --> 37:39.343
The resource centers were operating during the Charter School of San Diego's last renewal in 2012.

37:39.403 --> 37:49.086
The Charter School of San Diego established the resource centers within the Grossmont Union High School District boundaries in compliance with CDE guidance on the location of non-classroom based

37:49.567 --> 37:56.667
charter school resource centers, and at no point was there a definitive law expressly prohibiting the location of resource centers prior to the Anderson decision.

37:59.730 --> 38:04.012
The Grossmont Secondary School will be governed by the Board of the Audeo Charter Schools Corporation.

38:04.232 --> 38:10.594
Audeo Charter Corporation is an independent 501c3 nonprofit organization that directly operates its charter schools.

38:11.054 --> 38:17.536
The Audeo Corporate Board is directly responsible for the success of its charter schools and within the scope of oversight of the State Board of Education.

38:18.156 --> 38:27.299
Audeo Corporate Board further complies with the Brown Act in its meetings, the California Public Records Acts in its document, and the Political Reform Act in its conflict of interest provisions.

38:29.005 --> 38:36.713
For several years now, our schools have disaggregated our financial data by resource center in order to calculate a net result of operations for each resource center.

38:37.253 --> 38:49.325
To clarify the financial plan for the Grossmont Secondary School and part of the process for clearing the condition, the governing board of the Charter School of San Diego has passed a board resolution to transfer the net result of operations for the two resource centers

38:49.785 --> 38:54.908
in the petition to the Grossmont Secondary School to continue seamless operation of the Resource Center.

38:55.388 --> 38:55.949
As Ms.

38:55.969 --> 38:58.470
Tan stated, approximately $1.4 million.

38:58.690 --> 39:01.792
And I have a copy of the resolution for the board members.

39:02.913 --> 39:08.296
Financial and compliance audits have consistently found no exceptions since the Charter School of San Diego's founding in 1994.

39:09.337 --> 39:14.640
And the school has consistently earned 100% funding under SB 740 for multiple cycles.

39:16.610 --> 39:25.893
In 2015, members of the Grossmont Secondary School team were instrumental in the Charter School of San Diego being awarded the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award in the Education category.

39:26.513 --> 39:32.535
This is the nation's highest presidential honor for performance excellence through innovation, improvement, and visionary leadership.

39:33.155 --> 39:40.258
This was the first time the award was presented to a single school, and most importantly, a charter school in the Baldrige Award's 28-year history.

39:43.564 --> 39:48.468
The Charter School of San Diego began serving students in the communities of East San Diego County in 2002.

39:49.029 --> 39:56.014
In the fall of 2009, the leadership of the Charter School of San Diego submitted the Magna Carta charter petition to the Grossmont Union High School District.

39:56.635 --> 39:58.336
The Grossmont District denied the charter.

39:58.636 --> 40:04.761
At the time, legal interpretation supported the location of the resource centers within the district boundaries, so no appeal was sought.

40:05.342 --> 40:11.267
In 2012, the Charter School of San Diego was renewed by the San Diego Unified School District for a fifth charter term.

40:12.634 --> 40:20.761
In fact, the Charter School Office for San Diego Unified School District sent a letter of good standing to Grossmont Superintendent Timothy Glover in support of the petition.

40:21.562 --> 40:27.947
As far as our students are concerned, from 2011 to 2016, the Charter School of San Diego decreased its overall dropout rate from 4.6% to 2.5%.

40:30.970 --> 40:37.674
This is an outstanding achievement given that the majority of our students enrolled behind in credits, not on track to graduate in four years.

40:38.074 --> 40:42.657
Some of them are two grade levels behind in English and up to three grade levels behind in math.

40:43.778 --> 40:52.003
The current year information for dropout rate on DataQuest by the CDE is that the Charter School of San Diego is posting a 2.5% dropout rate for school year 2015-2016.

40:56.710 --> 41:05.084
In addition, the demand in East San Diego County has shown that we have served over 500 students annually for the last five to six years.

41:05.585 --> 41:09.752
And currently the enrollment at the two resource centers is over 300 students.

41:11.687 --> 41:20.790
We are a non-classroom based independent study program designed to support students, develop confidence in their abilities and lead them to a successful high school experience.

41:21.230 --> 41:31.393
To do so, we have a six year Walsh accreditation at the Charter School of San Diego, comprehensive course lists approved by both the University of California and the National Collegiate Athletic Association.

41:31.733 --> 41:34.754
This allows the school to fulfill its mission to transform lives.

41:37.429 --> 41:45.311
Students choose to enroll with us for many reasons, mostly because they've not been successful in the traditional school system or they're looking for a personalized education plan.

41:45.711 --> 42:04.136
Our student demographic trends indicate that about 65% of our students in middle and high school are credit deficient, 73% are socioeconomically disadvantaged, 76% represent a minority student population, and additionally, 19% of our students have IEPs or identified as special education.

42:05.458 --> 42:12.461
Some of our program highlights is our comprehensive English language development program with both an integrated and designated ELD program components.

42:13.181 --> 42:23.345
The integrated ELD program is designed to ensure that English learners can access core curriculum, build literacy skills while engaged in a rigorous curriculum aligned to common core standards.

42:23.625 --> 42:30.088
All courses are customized based on student skill level and interest and curriculum is scaffolded and language supports are embedded in each course.

42:31.072 --> 42:39.480
The designated ELD program is designed to ensure that our English learners are developing the critical English language skills, knowledge, and abilities needed for content learning in English.

42:39.921 --> 42:43.164
Our six courses are fully aligned to the California ELD standards.

42:44.997 --> 42:46.077
So what are our results?

42:46.277 --> 42:52.700
The majority of our English language students enroll in grades 10 through 12, several grade levels behind in reading and writing skills.

42:53.340 --> 43:00.263
Approximately 95% of our English learner students are at high risk of becoming long-term English learners.

43:00.743 --> 43:08.926
These are students who have not met progress and proficiency targets for reclassification given six or more years of ELD instruction in a traditional setting.

43:09.662 --> 43:16.151
Our results show that 61% of our long-term English learners attained a level of proficiency on the latest CELT results.

43:18.479 --> 43:26.202
The focus of the Grossmont Secondary School is to improve student learning, offer safe learning environment, and provide a highly qualified faculty and staff to our students.

43:26.783 --> 43:35.606
Guiding the design were the lessons learned while the Charter School of San Diego became one of the most successful alternative school accountability model schools, or ASAM, in the state of California.

43:35.886 --> 43:41.129
The Charter School of San Diego had the 23rd highest API score out of approximately 850 ASAM schools.

43:41.149 --> 43:41.789
And in the last

43:44.110 --> 43:52.972
three years of API, we were able to increase our API score by 38%, including significant increases in each of the subgroups published by the state.

43:53.632 --> 43:57.373
The Charter School of San Diego also offers the California Cadet Corps.

43:57.693 --> 44:01.754
The California Cadet Corps received the highest possible rating in state assessment metrics for 2016.

44:01.854 --> 44:02.634
We realized that

44:05.137 --> 44:11.441
The success of our students begins with our teachers, and their base compensation is 5% above that of San Diego Unified School District.

44:11.922 --> 44:16.685
We provide 100% employer-paid medical and dental plans for teachers and all eligible dependents.

44:17.325 --> 44:19.867
Our teacher retention rate for the past three years has averaged over 90%.

44:21.168 --> 44:26.952
Professional development is a major focus of our school, and we have had a great partnership with the San Diego County Office of Ed.

44:27.392 --> 44:34.097
Since January 2013, our teachers have participated in the excess of 10,000 hours of professional development at the county.

44:35.939 --> 44:40.362
As far as community support, parents, students, and teachers have written letters, sent postcards.

44:40.382 --> 44:42.944
You can see the postcards that have been delivered this morning.

44:42.984 --> 44:44.785
We have about 1,500 postcards.

44:45.246 --> 44:51.310
We have 55 additional people traveling to Sacramento today, but the flight out of San Diego this morning was delayed.

44:51.390 --> 44:52.551
So, they're en route here.

44:52.651 --> 44:55.773
So, hopefully, they'll get here before the end of the day.

44:57.555 --> 44:57.995
All right.

45:00.156 --> 45:03.539
So, that's a tremendous amount of support for the school and the program.

45:03.839 --> 45:04.740
So, in closing,

45:06.013 --> 45:12.117
I'd like to share a video of the comments made by Penny Pritzker at last year's Baldrige ceremony.

45:12.417 --> 45:12.958
She's the U.S.

45:12.998 --> 45:17.981
Commerce Secretary and I'd like to respectfully ask for you to approve this charter.

45:23.185 --> 45:27.728
Congratulations to the 2015 Baldrige Award recipients.

45:28.368 --> 45:33.572
Our four honorees have created efficient, effective organizations

45:34.059 --> 45:40.681
that provide exceptional services to customers and support your communities.

45:41.702 --> 45:46.303
As everyone here knows, earning the Baldrige Award is hard.

45:47.204 --> 46:01.689
It requires an organizational commitment to excellence, driven by senior leadership with vision, accomplished by engaged employees, and enabled by a customer-focused culture.

46:03.183 --> 46:06.925
But today's winners were willing to make that commitment.

46:07.866 --> 46:17.032
As a result, they are creating some of America's best products and services that bring value to their customers every day.

46:18.393 --> 46:31.862
To MidwayUSA, Charter School of San Diego, Charleston Area Medical Center Health System, and MidAmerica Transplant, I want to thank each of you

46:32.335 --> 46:34.976
for your dedication and for your leadership.

46:36.157 --> 46:49.342
Together, you embody the fundamental principle at the core of the Baldrige Awards, a never-ending quest for organizational innovation and performance excellence.

46:50.231 --> 46:55.094
Congratulations on this prestigious honor and on your success.

46:55.455 --> 46:55.735
Thank you.

46:56.095 --> 46:56.455
Thank you.

46:57.376 --> 46:59.437
Okay, 10 minutes on the nose.

46:59.537 --> 47:00.598
All right.

47:01.459 --> 47:07.963
So we will now have 10 minutes from the opponents of the charter petition.

47:14.784 --> 47:15.564
Good morning, State Board.

47:15.584 --> 47:20.265
My name is Dr. Tim Glover and I have the good fortune of being the superintendent in the Grossmont Union High School District.

47:20.925 --> 47:24.846
And I'm here as a very grassroots effort to ask that you deny this petition.

47:25.446 --> 47:27.307
Don't have a glitzy PowerPoint.

47:27.587 --> 47:28.867
I don't have any of that here for you.

47:28.947 --> 47:30.027
I'm not a corporation.

47:30.127 --> 47:31.108
I'm not a McCharter.

47:31.688 --> 47:39.049
I'm a simple school district with 17,000 students and an additional 5,000 students in two charters that belong to our school district.

47:39.149 --> 47:41.050
We're very authentic and we're very grassroots.

47:41.590 --> 47:43.812
I'm here to talk very simply with you today.

47:44.253 --> 47:49.417
And it's really about transparency, local control of school districts and who we serve.

47:50.058 --> 47:56.924
And when you hear this story about the charter being dropped off at the school district, yes, it was set on the counter at the front counter of the school district.

47:57.745 --> 48:11.734
And at the time I received that charter, I immediately called the charter petitioners and said, hey, is there a way I could get an extension on the timeline to review this thoroughly and also to allow an opportunity for an elected board, a newly elected board to weigh in to approve it?

48:12.494 --> 48:16.476
And what was very frustrating is all the conversations were positive on the phone.

48:16.857 --> 48:26.863
And then the very first communication I received from the petitioner is a four-page, take a deep breath, a four-page litigation letter saying they're going to sue us.

48:27.765 --> 48:33.787
So I want you to take a moment and think about collaboration, reaching out, being locally connected, and all of us serving our children.

48:33.927 --> 48:40.469
And that's the first communication I get from the charter school that's petitioning to become a collaborative member of our school district in that.

48:41.029 --> 48:43.710
We thoroughly went through the process of reviewing the charter.

48:44.130 --> 48:46.871
We had a much different finding about the English language process.

48:47.451 --> 48:51.473
The program they cited in their petition to us didn't even cover high school student age groups.

48:52.353 --> 48:56.736
So it's very interesting to me to see how this has been evolving and being manipulated through the process.

48:56.916 --> 49:01.779
So I would just ask to encourage you that despite what you see up there, that's not what we saw.

49:01.959 --> 49:10.085
And I think it's also very interesting when both the school district, the county where it will be located, both deny it and then it comes here and it's all of a sudden going to be okay.

49:10.685 --> 49:16.509
And then $600,000, if I didn't have $600,000 to be explained where it was coming from, there'd be serious questions.

49:16.909 --> 49:19.651
And I hope you do take serious concerns about where that's coming from.

49:20.171 --> 49:25.573
I'll turn it over to our Deputy Superintendent Scott Patterson and then our Attorney Dennis Wolverine-Kelley, Sarah Sutherland.

49:25.953 --> 49:26.333
Thank you.

49:29.954 --> 49:34.055
Good morning, President Kirsten, honorable members of the State Board of Education.

49:34.075 --> 49:34.936
I am Scott Patterson.

49:34.956 --> 49:38.817
I'm the Deputy Superintendent for the Grosmont Union High School District.

49:40.057 --> 49:46.199
State Board of Education should deny the Grosmont Secondary School appeal for the following reasons.

49:47.619 --> 49:53.061
The charter school has been operating illegally within our district boundaries since at least 2009.

49:53.261 --> 50:04.385
The charter school was on notice of this fact back in 2007 from the California Department of Education and in 2009 from our district.

50:05.265 --> 50:11.207
San Diego Unified, its chartering entity, has also required the charter to come into compliance with the law.

50:12.432 --> 50:23.094
Grosmont Secondary School is simply a new name for the same charter they have been operating illegally with notice in an attempt to paper over this grave problem.

50:25.554 --> 50:33.036
Grosmont Secondary School is not associated with the Grosmont Union High School District and its name is misleading at best.

50:34.596 --> 50:40.617
Grosmont and the San Diego County Office denied the Grosmont Secondary School for good and valid reasons.

50:41.482 --> 50:52.351
and a successful appeal granted by the SBE would be contrary and disrespectful of the detailed review and analysis conducted by the local agencies.

50:53.172 --> 51:02.299
Those agencies who would be forced to coexist with a charter that's been operating illegally with notice and over our objection for nearly 10 years.

51:04.201 --> 51:10.286
Anderson, the court case, has brought final clarity to an issue that had been intentionally misconstrued

51:11.021 --> 51:13.323
by the Charter for this nearly 10-year period.

51:15.004 --> 51:25.751
To thwart this clarity on an issue we have contended to the Charter all along and to reward the Charter for that disingenuousness is wrong and unjust.

51:26.351 --> 51:38.239
Finally, I know from personal professional experience that trying to exercise oversight over a Charter which is simply a fragment of an overall corporate entity

51:39.443 --> 52:00.182
not all of which is under the oversight of one agency, which this charter is, represents a fool's errand as it's impossible to clearly see the assets and the liabilities that are attributable to that fragment as they really belong to the corporate body without clear attribution or ownership by the charter being overseen.

52:01.062 --> 52:01.363
Thank you.

52:05.165 --> 52:07.086
Morning, President Kirst, members of the board.

52:07.947 --> 52:08.547
I'll be brief.

52:08.627 --> 52:12.349
I just want to point out that the petition entirely lacks transparency.

52:12.849 --> 52:19.493
It's misleading and fails to disclose a multitude of details that are incredibly relevant to this board's ability to oversee them if approved.

52:20.034 --> 52:28.638
This board is already an oversight agency for this very charter, but you can't figure out where the $600,000, your staff can't figure out the $600,000.

52:28.678 --> 52:29.399
That's a problem.

52:29.439 --> 52:30.920
They already have two oversight agencies.

52:31.881 --> 52:34.203
They actually operate at 34 locations.

52:34.583 --> 52:39.668
There's the Charter School of San Diego, Ardeo, Ardeo 2, Laurel Prep, then there's an Altus Network.

52:40.389 --> 52:49.358
It's really unclear from the petition how all of these corporations interact with one another, how people's salaries get set, where the board meets.

52:49.618 --> 52:50.719
There's no parent involvement.

52:50.759 --> 52:52.841
There's no parent members on the board.

52:53.181 --> 52:54.543
This petition was not

52:56.055 --> 53:02.200
generated because there was a need in Grossmont that they were trying to fulfill with the Grossmont community in mind.

53:03.601 --> 53:16.090
The story has changed between the time the petition was submitted to Grossmont in September to now, so I really would encourage you to, if you have not already, do a detailed review of the record and the findings that were made below because much effort went into that.

53:18.512 --> 53:19.893
The last thing I will point out is

53:21.152 --> 53:27.700
The lack of transparency creates many, many issues that we grapple with locally that I think are not visible from Sacramento.

53:28.561 --> 53:35.069
And to the extent you are going to approve this charter, I think you need to come down and see what is actually going on because

53:36.823 --> 53:39.964
We see here, Charter School of San Diego gets a Baldrige Award from the U.S.

53:39.984 --> 53:40.904
Department of Commerce.

53:40.965 --> 53:43.165
Well, is that Grossmont Secondary School or is it not?

53:43.585 --> 53:44.866
Who paid for everyone to fly up here?

53:45.026 --> 53:45.986
Where did that money come from?

53:46.927 --> 53:50.868
If Grossmont brought all of its teachers up here, we'd have to do that at a public board meeting.

53:51.988 --> 53:54.289
And that's not how decisions about financing are made here.

53:54.649 --> 54:03.853
Their lead executive, who was on the board till January of this year, the petition proposes for her to continue to be on the board of Audeo, makes twice as much as Cindy Martin.

54:04.733 --> 54:05.614
per ADA.

54:06.396 --> 54:09.260
Almost $400,000 in 2015 was reported in income for her.

54:11.223 --> 54:15.950
Although she didn't work for the charter school, she worked for their quote-unquote administrative provider, Altus.

54:17.232 --> 54:18.914
So I would really encourage you to

54:20.498 --> 54:34.957
scratch the surface and think about the transparency that is essential for public school operations that allow parents and students to know and participate in the process of deciding how their children are educated and by

54:36.278 --> 54:41.244
changing Charter School of San Diego to Grossmont Secondary School, but it otherwise staying exactly the same.

54:41.324 --> 54:51.196
It will do nothing other than create more confusion and entangle this board in substantial litigation that is already happening in the county over these very issues.

54:51.577 --> 54:54.400
So on that note, I would encourage you to deny this petition.

54:54.420 --> 54:55.181
These

54:55.922 --> 54:58.263
Petitioners already have charter schools.

54:58.683 --> 55:07.385
They already have authorization to operate charter schools under your oversight, under San Diego Unified's oversight, and another petition is entirely unnecessary.

55:08.005 --> 55:09.945
They showed you a chart of their operations.

55:10.085 --> 55:11.025
That was just part of it.

55:11.546 --> 55:12.926
It really looks more like this.

55:14.586 --> 55:16.927
They are showing you one part.

55:17.687 --> 55:18.607
So how do you oversee?

55:18.627 --> 55:19.447
Who oversees this?

55:21.028 --> 55:21.328
No one.

55:21.828 --> 55:22.408
That's the problem.

55:24.073 --> 55:26.155
We respectfully request for you to deny this petition.

55:26.335 --> 55:26.635
Thank you.

55:26.655 --> 55:28.817
Okay.

55:29.098 --> 55:34.262
I'm now going to close the public hearing and we will have public comment.

55:35.083 --> 55:36.284
Staff will call the list.

55:36.605 --> 55:36.865
Thank you.

55:41.007 --> 55:43.870
May the following people please line up at the podium.

55:44.430 --> 56:03.730
Christopher Carpenter, Austin Webster, Felizna Steffens, Eula Steffens, Michael Hanna, James Flannoy, Sai Sagiano, David Gaiotti, Brooke Hatfield, Joe Peluso, Jeanette Perez, and Michelle Lynch.

56:07.950 --> 56:13.813
Good afternoon or good morning, board members, President Kirsten and Superintendent Torlakson's representative here.

56:14.173 --> 56:18.255
My name is Christopher Carpenter from Young Menin Corps representing Grossmont Secondary School.

56:18.755 --> 56:20.115
I wish to make a couple of notes.

56:20.155 --> 56:26.858
First, I wanted to express appreciation for staff and their thorough review of the petition and discussing with us any issues that may be there.

56:26.938 --> 56:30.960
We are fully accepting of all the conditions and technical amendments there.

56:31.480 --> 56:34.702
I wish to point out that we did not threaten to sue

56:35.962 --> 56:45.824
Grossmont Union High School District, we provided the notice of the statutory timeframes necessary and the fact that if we were not heard, the school might have to be put out of operation for a period of time.

56:45.864 --> 56:49.825
And we have hundreds and hundreds of students, thousands over the past years that have attended this school.

56:50.265 --> 56:53.065
And our focus is to ensure that that education continues.

56:53.865 --> 56:59.046
Lastly, the organization as presented in the petition is exactly as it exists now.

56:59.226 --> 56:59.366
Ms.

56:59.386 --> 57:02.627
Sutherland is operating on previous information or information that is incorrect.

57:03.307 --> 57:10.510
I'll note that the district has never reached out to us for any clarification when we submitted our petitions and they did in fact try to sue us in 2009.

57:11.030 --> 57:11.370
Thank you.

57:19.753 --> 57:21.694
Hello, my name is Austin Webster.

57:22.174 --> 57:25.075
I've been part of the charter school of San Diego for a year and a half.

57:25.595 --> 57:26.636
I am a senior graduate.

57:27.557 --> 57:40.364
When I started in traditional school, despite having an IEP saying that I can have extra time on homework and assignments and on tests, I didn't find that I was getting the real help that I needed and started failing in all my classes.

57:41.324 --> 57:43.785
So I decided to come to the Charter School of San Diego.

57:44.045 --> 57:46.147
It has been the best decision I've ever made.

57:46.987 --> 57:52.510
I'm supported by the teachers who have really helped me through my high school struggles and have gotten me where I am today.

57:53.846 --> 57:59.688
Attending the Charter School of San Diego was the best decision for me because now I am able to go at my own pace.

58:00.768 --> 58:05.609
And even when I stumble or take extra time, the teachers are there to help me get back on track.

58:07.350 --> 58:08.610
Once again, I cannot thank Ms.

58:08.650 --> 58:09.550
Road and Ms.

58:09.570 --> 58:17.032
Frank and the rest of the staff at the Charter School of San Diego enough for everything that they have done to get me to the point where I am right now.

58:18.213 --> 58:22.154
I hope that you will approve this petition so other students may feel the same way.

58:22.694 --> 58:22.954
Thank you.

58:29.648 --> 58:29.988
Hello.

58:30.228 --> 58:34.269
My name is Valencia and I'm currently a special education student at Charter School of San Diego.

58:34.830 --> 58:39.451
When I was at a traditional public school I couldn't focus in a hectic environment and my grades started to suffer.

58:40.171 --> 58:43.412
That's when I started to hang around with the wrong crowd and knew I needed a change.

58:44.012 --> 58:50.194
I yet again tried a traditional school but my family and I lived far away and it took four hours to get to and from school every day.

58:50.834 --> 58:53.395
I was chronically late in my grades and started to fall.

58:54.855 --> 58:57.076
That's when I found CSSD which I love.

58:57.668 --> 59:00.491
It meets my needs and provides a better environment for me.

59:00.932 --> 59:03.234
Thanks to the flexible schedule I can work independently.

59:03.815 --> 59:08.560
I also have access to fantastic teachers who really help us meet our goals and find success.

59:08.760 --> 59:13.565
I especially like the Pathway Program because it helped us find a path and success in life.

59:13.965 --> 59:20.332
I am excelling in a quiet environment I'm still to share after starting out from behind that I would graduate this year on time.

59:29.048 --> 59:29.609
Good morning.

59:30.089 --> 59:31.631
My name is Eula Stephens.

59:31.911 --> 59:33.913
I'm Felicia Stephens' grandmother.

59:38.938 --> 59:47.587
Her mother and I thought that she would never make it through graduation.

59:47.847 --> 59:49.029
Excuse me, I'm nervous.

59:50.817 --> 59:55.700
but she got motivated when she found CSST.

59:56.540 --> 01:00:02.623
It was her teacher's encouragement that inspired her to excel in school.

01:00:03.543 --> 01:00:10.127
Without them, a lot of kids wouldn't be able to make it.

01:00:13.569 --> 01:00:19.832
Would you please approve the petition to keep this school for the kids who are

01:00:20.825 --> 01:00:24.826
or behind like my granddaughter was so.

01:00:25.826 --> 01:00:30.607
They have the opportunity to make it like she did.

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:43.530
Please, you know, keep the kids off of the streets and then keep them out of trouble if you, you know, kindly, excuse me because I'm nervous.

01:00:43.930 --> 01:00:44.330
Thank you.

01:00:53.257 --> 01:00:53.637
Good morning.

01:00:53.677 --> 01:00:54.598
My name is Michael Hanna.

01:00:54.718 --> 01:00:58.221
I'm the Military Advisor and the Cadet Corps Commandant for the Charter School of San Diego.

01:00:58.642 --> 01:00:59.642
I just received an update.

01:00:59.662 --> 01:01:02.405
I wanted to let you all know that our members who are on the flight are here.

01:01:02.805 --> 01:01:03.866
Unfortunately, they're outside.

01:01:03.886 --> 01:01:07.189
They're not being let in, but they made it, so we're happy they're here with us.

01:01:12.731 --> 01:01:25.760
So our Cadet Corps program is an applied leadership program in which students become more aware of their potential and better prepared for the opportunities the world has to offer them by accepting challenge and having a growth mindset.

01:01:26.781 --> 01:01:32.966
The Cadet Corps is one of the many tools that our school uses to engage our students and allows us to contribute to our mission of transforming lives.

01:01:33.887 --> 01:01:38.471
As such, I've been fortunate enough to witness firsthand the transformation that these students experience.

01:01:39.091 --> 01:01:41.913
As you'll soon hear from two cadets that I'm very proud of,

01:01:42.654 --> 01:01:48.684
Our cadets have remarkable stories that illustrate how access to the Charter School of San Diego and the Cadet Corps program have changed their lives.

01:01:49.225 --> 01:01:56.537
I believe that it is critical to these students and future students that they continue to have access to our program and I urge you to approve our petition.

01:01:56.797 --> 01:01:57.078
Thank you.

01:02:05.595 --> 01:02:05.955
Good morning.

01:02:07.497 --> 01:02:08.798
I'm Cadet Staff Sergeant Flannery.

01:02:09.419 --> 01:02:12.042
I've been attending the Charter School of San Diego since 2015.

01:02:13.143 --> 01:02:16.567
And I came here for more individualized attention from teachers.

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:19.950
I came from a traditional high school where I was falling behind.

01:02:21.011 --> 01:02:25.433
And I became a cadet in the California Cadet Corps in the same year of 2015.

01:02:25.513 --> 01:02:28.995
And I'm more active in my community now.

01:02:29.896 --> 01:02:33.998
And I care for others more than I can care for myself and my team.

01:02:34.018 --> 01:02:35.678
And I've learned to never give up.

01:02:36.499 --> 01:02:39.620
I learned that failure should be seen as motivation to get back up and try again.

01:02:40.601 --> 01:02:44.583
The charter school has done so much for me, and these teachers have impacted my life in such a positive way.

01:02:45.384 --> 01:02:51.834
They're role models that I can look up to and they can show students like me how to be young adults and how to live in the real world.

01:02:52.916 --> 01:02:56.121
I'm proud to say that I've graduated and I'm following my career in the U.S.

01:02:56.141 --> 01:02:56.382
Navy.

01:02:57.323 --> 01:02:57.584
Thank you.

01:03:06.872 --> 01:03:07.312
Good morning.

01:03:08.312 --> 01:03:12.793
My name is Saitupu El-Sangiel and I am currently a graduating senior at the Charter School of San Diego.

01:03:13.694 --> 01:03:19.375
I've attended the Charter School of San Diego since the sixth grade due to the fact that my mom wanted me to go to a safer alternative for school.

01:03:20.295 --> 01:03:24.756
But the Charter School of San Diego didn't just offer me a safety blanket.

01:03:25.336 --> 01:03:27.577
It also gave me the opportunity to gain leadership skills.

01:03:28.433 --> 01:03:33.560
I participated in the California Cadet Corps where I was able to push myself outside of my comfort zone and grow as a leader.

01:03:34.261 --> 01:03:40.130
I competed in the statewide academic competition and won first place, the highest competitive award in the California Cadet Corps.

01:03:41.051 --> 01:03:44.536
Without the Charter School of San Diego, my accomplishments wouldn't have been possible.

01:03:45.424 --> 01:03:49.125
The teachers understand that not all children learn the same way or go through the same things.

01:03:49.725 --> 01:03:53.526
And though it may not seem like it at times, we as kids appreciate this more than anything else.

01:03:54.727 --> 01:03:59.208
The Charter School of San Diego has been a door opener for many kids and the last door open for some.

01:03:59.968 --> 01:04:05.550
This school needs to continue to help children grow and succeed, as it has always done, no matter what obstacles we may face.

01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:06.490
Thank you.

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:16.060
Good morning.

01:04:17.401 --> 01:04:18.381
My name is David Goyette.

01:04:18.701 --> 01:04:20.362
I'm a teacher with the Charter School of San Diego.

01:04:20.482 --> 01:04:23.483
I'm proud to speak to you today in support of the Grossmont Secondary Petition.

01:04:24.464 --> 01:04:30.426
In my 18 years as a teacher, I've seen firsthand how some traditional charter schools struggle to support their instructional staff and students.

01:04:31.146 --> 01:04:38.930
By contrast, our CSSD support staff and professional development programs ensure that our teachers have all the tools and training to guide their students toward success.

01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:43.932
CSSD teachers are compensated 5% above the local district's pay scale.

01:04:44.813 --> 01:04:48.195
Our generous benefits package gives teachers and their families peace of mind.

01:04:49.855 --> 01:04:52.997
Our classrooms are well equipped with the latest technology and materials.

01:04:54.278 --> 01:05:03.243
As a teacher who began as a classroom assistant and has served as a teacher representative on our school's board of directors, I can attest to the robust support teachers receive every day in our program.

01:05:03.943 --> 01:05:09.005
I'm thankful to be a part of an organization that honors its teachers so that we can put our students first.

01:05:09.505 --> 01:05:10.085
Thank you for your time.

01:05:16.828 --> 01:05:17.408
Good morning.

01:05:17.528 --> 01:05:22.490
My name is Brooke Hatfield and I'm a second year education specialist and Teach for America core member.

01:05:23.544 --> 01:05:34.027
When I decided to become a teacher, I wanted to be part of an organization that fought every single day for the undeniable reality that every student outcome matters.

01:05:34.947 --> 01:05:36.828
That is why I joined Teach for America.

01:05:37.828 --> 01:05:47.331
I quickly realized the strong alignment between what the Charter School of San Diego does for students and families and the mission, vision, and values of Teach for America San Diego.

01:05:48.507 --> 01:06:04.606
At CSSD, we individualize every student's educational foundation and serve an entire population of exceptional, resilient students who simply require a unique educational option to achieve their personal and academic goals.

01:06:05.925 --> 01:06:20.433
I am proud to be part of a team that works relentlessly to be stewards of educational equity and who maintains the unwavering conviction that every student deserves access to an education that will foster self-determined transformation and achievement.

01:06:20.533 --> 01:06:30.978
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.

01:06:30.998 --> 01:06:31.959
My name is Joe Peluso.

01:06:33.081 --> 01:06:34.704
I am not an educator.

01:06:34.724 --> 01:06:38.290
I'm a retired Navy veteran of 52 years of service with the U.S.

01:06:38.330 --> 01:06:38.591
Navy.

01:06:38.651 --> 01:06:40.554
I served in submarines and naval aviation.

01:06:41.235 --> 01:06:46.424
I am here with my grandson, Austin Webster, who you've already talked to, and I got to put my cheaters on to read this.

01:06:50.236 --> 01:06:53.579
He's a graduating senior at Charter School of San Diego.

01:06:54.160 --> 01:07:05.630
Charter School personnel I have interfaced with over the years, and my wife has been very active in this, are truly dedicated to the mission of providing a quality education to students that need more direct contact with their teachers.

01:07:06.926 --> 01:07:11.168
as well as being able to study one subject at a time and concentrate on that.

01:07:11.688 --> 01:07:14.509
Not every student does well in conventional schools.

01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:15.350
He didn't.

01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:16.650
Austin was one of those.

01:07:17.151 --> 01:07:26.715
Charter School fills that gap for Austin and other students by providing the one-on-one assistance that students such as Austin need to be competitive and successful.

01:07:27.495 --> 01:07:30.497
As they transition to adulthood, this, in my opinion,

01:07:31.537 --> 01:07:36.640
is the core mission of Charter School of San Diego and they are meeting that resistance exceptionally well.

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:37.141
Thank you.

01:07:43.845 --> 01:07:44.325
Good morning.

01:07:44.385 --> 01:07:49.248
My name is Jeanette Perez and I have been a teacher at the Charter School of San Diego for 23 years.

01:07:50.902 --> 01:07:59.247
During this time, I've seen firsthand the opportunities this school offers students so they can be successful, productive students.

01:08:00.088 --> 01:08:04.590
Just this week, one of my students became the first to graduate in her family.

01:08:05.231 --> 01:08:07.913
This has been the case for hundreds of my students.

01:08:08.853 --> 01:08:15.157
One month ago, one of my students who had been homeless for most of her life finally got her high school diploma.

01:08:15.998 --> 01:08:19.500
Unfortunately, this type of situation

01:08:21.129 --> 01:08:24.630
is not outside the norm with our student population.

01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:36.853
One of the best things about CSSD is the design, resources, and special training we are provided which allows us to meet these students' needs and move them forward.

01:08:37.954 --> 01:08:46.736
In fact, in March, I was honored to receive the 2017 Heart Vision California Charter Teacher of the Year Award.

01:08:48.325 --> 01:08:57.871
Because of the great work we do at Charter School of San Diego, please approve the Grossmont Secondary Charter so that we can continue to transform lives.

01:08:58.192 --> 01:08:58.512
Thank you.

01:09:04.144 --> 01:09:04.584
Good morning.

01:09:04.764 --> 01:09:05.964
My name is Andra Donovan.

01:09:06.024 --> 01:09:08.605
I'm General Counsel for San Diego Unified School District.

01:09:09.065 --> 01:09:13.246
I heard someone say that we provided a letter of good standing to Charter School of San Diego.

01:09:13.266 --> 01:09:23.769
I want to make very clear that is in no way an endorsement of the Grossmont Secondary School, nor is it an endorsement of the Charter School of San Diego, and it was not intended to be used as such.

01:09:24.669 --> 01:09:30.294
During, it is true simply that we have authorized out of School of San Diego and we have not revoked their charter.

01:09:30.815 --> 01:09:42.825
However, you also heard Mr. Patterson talk about the fact that we have identified self-dealing by the board president to the tune of close to $400,000 in salaries that she authorized for herself.

01:09:43.246 --> 01:09:45.508
We identified property transfers publicly,

01:09:46.428 --> 01:09:50.272
paid for property transferred to a private corporation that had to be refit first.

01:09:50.792 --> 01:09:54.396
And we identified multiple illegal facilities that needed to be closed.

01:09:55.236 --> 01:10:00.041
I've heard the phrase used repeatedly in this room, come into compliance with the Anderson decision.

01:10:00.501 --> 01:10:03.004
The Anderson decision is not what needs to be complied with.

01:10:03.064 --> 01:10:03.584
It is the law.

01:10:04.005 --> 01:10:05.026
And it has been the law since 2002.

01:10:05.446 --> 01:10:10.511
And for Trump to come here and tell you that they didn't know that is patently untrue.

01:10:10.831 --> 01:10:11.131
Thank you.

01:10:17.182 --> 01:10:20.163
Good morning, Lorraine Richards, California Teachers Association.

01:10:20.243 --> 01:10:22.424
CTA opposes this petition.

01:10:22.864 --> 01:10:28.847
Democracy is practiced at the local elections for school board and the school district represents those students.

01:10:29.547 --> 01:10:34.269
Greater accountability and transparency with finances are definitely needed in this case.

01:10:34.849 --> 01:10:38.531
Local control is essential to maximize the education of all students.

01:10:39.051 --> 01:10:41.595
I would also like to mention the adjustment to one minute.

01:10:41.916 --> 01:10:47.405
A public comment is unreasonable for many that travel to give support or oppose items on the waivers.

01:10:47.725 --> 01:10:47.986
Thank you.

01:10:53.484 --> 01:10:55.305
Eric Premack, Charter Schools Development Center.

01:10:55.426 --> 01:11:04.793
We have a 20 plus year relationship with the leaders of this organization and believe it's one of the best managed charter organizations that we've run into.

01:11:04.873 --> 01:11:10.417
They also have some of the strongest balance sheets and financial management practices that we've run into.

01:11:10.937 --> 01:11:17.742
We have zero concern about their financial sustainability and support the staff and ACCS recommendation to approve.

01:11:18.043 --> 01:11:18.323
Thank you.

01:11:23.188 --> 01:11:25.889
Good morning, Michelle Lynch on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association.

01:11:25.909 --> 01:11:27.210
I just want to echo what Eric said.

01:11:27.250 --> 01:11:28.771
We've worked with this organization for years.

01:11:29.191 --> 01:11:33.893
We have strong confidence in not only their academics, but also in their transparency and in their finances.

01:11:35.002 --> 01:11:39.945
They did a great job of coming in early to come into compliance with the Anderson decision.

01:11:40.506 --> 01:11:47.089
The law before the Anderson decision was fairly commonly interpreted as even CDE interpreted as allowing these things.

01:11:47.149 --> 01:11:52.993
So, we do believe it was a great practice of audio to come in or correspond to come in so early and submit this new petition.

01:11:53.193 --> 01:11:54.294
We ask you to approve them today.

01:11:54.474 --> 01:11:54.734
Thank you.

01:12:07.882 --> 01:12:08.611
Can we have...

01:13:08.618 --> 01:13:09.238
That's a new one.

01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:11.440
Okay.

01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:13.141
Does that conclude the public comment?

01:13:13.542 --> 01:13:14.002
Okay.

01:13:15.563 --> 01:13:18.705
So let's have some board member discussion on this.

01:13:18.725 --> 01:13:21.908
The board member charter liaisons may want to start this.

01:13:25.570 --> 01:13:25.851
Okay.

01:13:29.373 --> 01:13:32.095
This is a situation where

01:13:34.544 --> 01:13:38.787
This organization has already been in existence.

01:13:39.508 --> 01:13:40.548
They were resource centers.

01:13:41.089 --> 01:13:46.292
They are coming into compliance with the Anderson case by creating a new charter school.

01:13:46.773 --> 01:13:57.000
This is one of the transition ways that resource center type schools will be taking over the next year.

01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:01.683
So we'll see, no doubt, more of these types of new creation of charter schools.

01:14:02.893 --> 01:14:05.154
I think this is a sound petition.

01:14:05.214 --> 01:14:06.595
The ACCS voted for it.

01:14:07.395 --> 01:14:08.816
CDE has voted for it.

01:14:09.056 --> 01:14:10.717
They have a very good track record.

01:14:11.657 --> 01:14:14.718
To win the Baldrige Award is pretty amazing right there.

01:14:15.639 --> 01:14:17.139
That's a real coup.

01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:23.622
I don't have concerns about the financial situation.

01:14:24.402 --> 01:14:25.843
I know that Cindy takes a very

01:14:27.084 --> 01:14:33.769
careful look at it, and she's very well versed in the financial structures of these types of organizations.

01:14:33.849 --> 01:14:41.536
So I have a great deal of confidence that this new charter school will continue to serve kids very, very well.

01:14:41.556 --> 01:14:46.240
Okay, and a comment by Board Member Williams.

01:14:46.727 --> 01:15:04.580
The only thing I would add is that, is that I don't think anyone, well, we weren't looking forward to all the changes and the waivers and the process that we were going to need to deal with, with the Shasta decision.

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:15.488
And I think that the policy that the staff helped put together and legal help put together was a fair one, a good one to give a year.

01:15:16.708 --> 01:15:20.230
waiver for these schools to figure out what they were going to do next.

01:15:20.770 --> 01:15:33.755
This is one of the first schools to come through and because of that, I think the CDE, in particular, with the State Board staff, looked at this very, very carefully.

01:15:34.475 --> 01:15:43.759
because it would be a, you know, a first time that we've seen this kind of transition.

01:15:44.379 --> 01:15:49.521
And I have absolute confidence in the staff's recommendation and their thorough review of this.

01:15:49.541 --> 01:15:54.003
Okay, is there any more board member comment on this?

01:15:54.103 --> 01:15:55.784
Board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

01:15:58.111 --> 01:16:01.512
I have more of a question because it may be a very basic one.

01:16:01.532 --> 01:16:23.977
One, my concern is never really with the heart of the school, which is the teachers and the students, but the structures that are coming before us are becoming a little more and more complex and it's harder for me to understand, though I work with charter schools as affiliates, you know, these are becoming a lot more corporate-like and it's always hard for me to keep up with what's what and who's who.

01:16:25.258 --> 01:16:34.044
So, I would appreciate a little bit of a breakdown of how one of the flow maps that they showed the structure just looked humongous.

01:16:34.224 --> 01:16:38.748
So, what is this charter school in relation to all those other pieces?

01:16:39.248 --> 01:16:49.456
And then the five percent reserve, the set aside, again, this is maybe a basic question, but how long do we give them to show proof of that five percent?

01:16:51.035 --> 01:16:55.122
Well, let me answer the second one first, because I don't have the actual chart.

01:16:55.162 --> 01:17:01.011
I just want to say I don't have, we can pull up the org chart, but it didn't look, the one in the petition doesn't look like that.

01:17:01.151 --> 01:17:03.355
So I, yeah, it's.

01:17:04.625 --> 01:17:07.206
I'm not sure we'd have to look at the larger one.

01:17:07.266 --> 01:17:15.047
I don't know if that one possibly is more of the organization if they're part of a CMO.

01:17:15.407 --> 01:17:24.069
Maybe it's a bigger structure, but in terms of the one we looked at, the governance structure was a little more, it was smaller and a little more self-contained.

01:17:24.149 --> 01:17:29.330
So we can pull up and look at what was in the petition, but just

01:17:42.903 --> 01:17:43.283
Oh.

01:17:43.724 --> 01:17:44.004
OK.

01:17:44.864 --> 01:17:45.124
Yeah.

01:17:45.164 --> 01:17:47.785
So this is one of Altus charter schools.

01:17:48.485 --> 01:17:51.925
So that sounds like that's more of the of the larger organization.

01:17:51.945 --> 01:17:51.986
So.

01:17:56.166 --> 01:18:02.568
I just saw this one today.

01:18:04.986 --> 01:18:10.209
Okay, so let me, we'll look at that and just get back to you on the first question.

01:18:11.109 --> 01:18:12.350
What was on the reserve?

01:18:13.050 --> 01:18:19.173
As far as that, I mean, we give a little more flexibility to charter schools in their first year of operation.

01:18:19.193 --> 01:18:24.095
I mean, they're still trying to get their feet landed and the money hasn't flowing in.

01:18:24.235 --> 01:18:26.196
And so we typically give them the year.

01:18:27.176 --> 01:18:35.961
You'll see one at the end of the day where it's one of the newer ones and it's in a position now where there's a little bit of a struggle.

01:18:36.561 --> 01:18:40.563
But we allowed it to operate a year to make sure that it did get its enrollment.

01:18:40.644 --> 01:18:46.186
I mean, any new charter school to make sure that it's getting its pupils in, there's sometimes delays in opening.

01:18:46.667 --> 01:18:50.229
So it affects the enrollment of the charter school.

01:18:50.309 --> 01:18:52.530
We don't even issue, you know,

01:18:53.350 --> 01:19:02.938
Usually it may be a lot of concern, but we kind of monitor their budget in phases because the law requires a charter school, just like school districts, to report at different times during the year.

01:19:02.978 --> 01:19:04.439
So there's the interim reporting.

01:19:04.979 --> 01:19:08.682
So we kind of track schools monthly, especially ones that might be struggling.

01:19:09.242 --> 01:19:17.408
But typically we wait for a first interim, which allows a school to give a first look, maybe like a quarter to a half a year's look of the financials.

01:19:17.468 --> 01:19:23.832
And again, everything is on an estimated basis until the point where a school can get its independent auditor in.

01:19:24.392 --> 01:19:36.696
So we actually monitor those a little more closely, especially ones that are not at their enrollment level because that drives all of the funding for the charter schools typically.

01:19:36.716 --> 01:19:40.078
I mean, the LCFF money is driven by attendance, ADA.

01:19:40.558 --> 01:19:48.681
So if we see that enrollment is dropping or enrollment isn't at where it should be, then we monitor more closely and you'll see that in another one.

01:19:48.761 --> 01:19:49.521
But in this case,

01:19:50.561 --> 01:19:54.763
They're a negative reserve and they're not at zero by our calculations.

01:19:54.783 --> 01:19:56.303
They're at about three percent.

01:19:56.383 --> 01:19:59.585
So that's not bad, but it's not five.

01:20:00.125 --> 01:20:04.106
And the State Board Memorandum of Understanding requires a five percent reserve.

01:20:04.146 --> 01:20:14.590
So we would like the charter school in this case, if it's approved, we would want to see that five percent reserve at some point during the year as it's growing and that it can get there by the end of the year.

01:20:15.291 --> 01:20:17.912
So we would allow some time, but

01:20:18.912 --> 01:20:22.413
probably towards the end of the year, we would issue some sort of notice to them.

01:20:22.453 --> 01:20:22.673
Yes.

01:20:22.713 --> 01:20:26.335
So we'll go back and look at the org chart and we'll get back to you.

01:20:26.355 --> 01:20:27.775
I want to make sure it's the one we looked at.

01:20:27.795 --> 01:20:29.796
All right.

01:20:30.036 --> 01:20:32.357
Other questions by Board Member Burr.

01:20:34.752 --> 01:20:40.356
So first, I just want to say that reinforce, I think, what both Eric Premack said and Michelle Lowe.

01:20:40.396 --> 01:20:42.517
This is one of our oldest charter schools.

01:20:42.617 --> 01:20:44.378
It goes back to 1994.

01:20:44.459 --> 01:20:46.860
It was started as the Charter School of San Diego.

01:20:47.601 --> 01:20:59.068
And I think as witnessed by the presentation by the school, one of the most highly regarded one, and certainly by the testimony of the students, one that is very responsive to the needs of the students.

01:20:59.108 --> 01:21:03.110
So I just want to commend them for the work they've done over the years.

01:21:04.611 --> 01:21:09.913
I guess what I want to talk about is this issue about these resource centers coming on appeal to us.

01:21:10.153 --> 01:21:14.034
And Cindy or Nick, this is kind of a question for you guys.

01:21:14.874 --> 01:21:23.156
That when I looked at how many waivers we put, I'm concerned about the expectation that we're going to see however many, 20 some odd

01:21:23.977 --> 01:21:27.360
petitions come before the state board to be authorized.

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:32.866
And I think at some point, we reach our capacity to do this work in an effective way.

01:21:33.367 --> 01:21:41.976
So I guess for me, it's more a statement about, and I've made the statement many times, charters are supposed to be locally authorized.

01:21:42.096 --> 01:21:45.360
That's what they're about, to offer the opportunity in the community.

01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:54.344
And I would just say based on the conversation between the parties here, there seems to be not a very healthy relationship or a positive relationship there.

01:21:54.404 --> 01:21:56.545
So I understand how you got here.

01:21:57.326 --> 01:22:14.854
But I just hope that for all of the other resource centers that find themselves in these positions and all of the other school districts that find themselves with resource centers located in their geographic boundaries, that they can find a way to make this work on behalf of students in their communities.

01:22:17.389 --> 01:22:18.810
Yeah, I'll second that.

01:22:21.911 --> 01:22:22.551
Karen.

01:22:24.512 --> 01:22:31.355
So again, I commend the students who came today and spoke about their experiences and the positivity that you're experiencing there.

01:22:31.855 --> 01:22:33.876
My question is more on the structure.

01:22:34.136 --> 01:22:38.758
And when I think about local control, and I concur with Board Member Burr,

01:22:39.958 --> 01:22:48.461
I'm looking at the governing board structure and I'm looking at how can you do local control based on that kind of a structure.

01:22:48.481 --> 01:23:01.446
So I was wondering if staff could maybe clarify who the governing board would be and are their parents representing the decisions that are making, especially as we talk about different levels of funding and input.

01:23:02.306 --> 01:23:03.267
So that's my question.

01:23:03.287 --> 01:23:08.349
Did you hear my question?

01:23:08.769 --> 01:23:08.929
Sorry.

01:23:15.683 --> 01:23:21.107
And is it one governing board or is there a, what's the structure going to look like?

01:23:22.288 --> 01:23:23.168
I can answer that one.

01:23:23.208 --> 01:23:27.992
And when we looked at the org chart that we have that's in the petition is this one.

01:23:28.032 --> 01:23:34.216
I mean, it looks like it's more because it's blown up, but really it is a mirror image of this.

01:23:34.937 --> 01:23:38.859
So somehow these three and the charter school might need to come up and explain that.

01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:42.422
These three aren't connected in terms of the chart.

01:23:43.102 --> 01:23:50.209
The one that we looked at, the one that's in the petition, is this one that's under Adeo Charter School or Adeo Charter School Incorporated.

01:23:50.669 --> 01:23:54.153
And then the new gross month secondary falls under that.

01:23:54.293 --> 01:23:56.515
That is a government structure that's in the petition.

01:23:57.536 --> 01:23:59.878
This other one, we can't explain this.

01:24:00.018 --> 01:24:03.662
They'll have to explain it because there, it looks like maybe there's a common

01:24:04.382 --> 01:24:11.046
denominator within the three, but the organizations aren't connected at least into this chart.

01:24:11.266 --> 01:24:12.426
They don't connect to each other.

01:24:12.446 --> 01:24:13.527
So they'll have to explain that.

01:24:14.107 --> 01:24:16.969
But the one we looked at is a component of that.

01:24:18.110 --> 01:24:19.710
And then what was the second question?

01:24:21.391 --> 01:24:23.232
Oh, there are.

01:24:23.252 --> 01:24:24.653
I mean, let me read.

01:24:24.793 --> 01:24:27.294
But we do have a technical amendment in that area.

01:24:28.215 --> 01:24:29.856
So in the governance structure,

01:24:37.546 --> 01:25:04.467
they what they presented was a board of directors and they also have a an area on parent involvement in governance and we didn't feel that it was as robust as it should be so we're asking as a technical amendment specifically how the school ensure that parental involvement in the governance of the charter school beyond what we see are maybe it's a little more limited than what we might see in other petitions

01:25:05.007 --> 01:25:06.108
that's currently stated.

01:25:06.168 --> 01:25:10.971
So we're asking for them to add a little bit more in terms of parent involvement.

01:25:11.111 --> 01:25:15.093
So there is some involvement, but we feel like it maybe should be some more.

01:25:15.594 --> 01:25:17.735
So that wasn't a no in that area.

01:25:17.835 --> 01:25:24.419
It was more, we think that it was more technical amendment where they can add to that because they already have something there.

01:25:24.839 --> 01:25:28.322
We just want it to be explained a little more and expanded a little bit more.

01:25:29.322 --> 01:25:37.251
So in terms of the other, I think the Charter School should come up and explain the larger structure because that isn't what's in the petition.

01:25:37.291 --> 01:25:38.733
That isn't what's before you today.

01:25:39.474 --> 01:25:41.876
Could I clarify one thing on the answer that you just gave?

01:25:42.837 --> 01:25:48.043
Is it one board over all of these entities or is there a separate board for the new Grossmont?

01:25:49.494 --> 01:25:52.276
Oh, it's, yes, yes, they can explain it.

01:25:52.356 --> 01:25:54.137
It looks like there is a board.

01:25:54.257 --> 01:25:55.198
I don't know what yes is.

01:25:55.938 --> 01:25:59.441
That there is, it's not this other, this other big chart.

01:25:59.521 --> 01:26:06.265
There is a separate board that's over the charter school that's actually author over three separate charter schools.

01:26:06.986 --> 01:26:11.189
Sweet, this Sweetwater one, Grossmont one, excuse me, is being, is one of them.

01:26:15.111 --> 01:26:15.712
Yeah, go ahead.

01:26:17.543 --> 01:26:19.443
Hi, Christopher Carpenter, Young Meeting Corp.

01:26:19.463 --> 01:26:22.184
representing Gressmont Charter, Gressmont Secondary School.

01:26:22.224 --> 01:26:31.446
I want to note that the organizational structure sheet passed out by DWK was created by DWK for their purposes in trying to tear down the school.

01:26:31.886 --> 01:26:34.787
It does not reflect the current organization of the school.

01:26:34.807 --> 01:26:41.108
Rodeo Charter School is a 501c3 nonprofit corporation, standalone.

01:26:41.248 --> 01:26:43.549
It does not have any related board members on it.

01:26:44.029 --> 01:26:45.750
Marianne Bixby does not sit on this board.

01:26:47.091 --> 01:26:50.412
The Audeo Charter School Corporation will oversee three schools.

01:26:51.313 --> 01:27:02.318
That's Audeo Charter School 2, which is approved by this board last year, Grossmont Secondary School, if approved, and then Sweetwater Secondary School, which is also coming up on appeal at your next meeting.

01:27:03.118 --> 01:27:06.260
Those three schools will be overseen by Audeo Charter School Incorporated.

01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:11.325
The remainder of the organizations are overseeing Charter School of San Diego.

01:27:11.766 --> 01:27:19.975
As was referenced, the Charter School of San Diego is an organization that operates Charter School of San Diego, Laurel Preparatory Academy, and

01:27:23.130 --> 01:27:26.391
a DAO charter school within the boundaries of San Diego Unified School District.

01:27:26.651 --> 01:27:31.673
They are authorized by San Diego Unified School District, those three schools overseen by one board.

01:27:31.733 --> 01:27:37.555
So it's a similar structure, just like different petitions, different organization, different board members as well.

01:27:38.116 --> 01:27:46.819
Again, the chart before you from DWK with big DWK letters up in the corner is not accurate and does not reflect the current operations of the organization.

01:27:48.027 --> 01:27:57.451
Yeah, let me, well, we can question this, but I also want to have the district people come up and explain what Alda's Charter Schools is.

01:27:58.251 --> 01:27:58.792
What is that?

01:27:59.092 --> 01:27:59.492
I mean,

01:28:00.282 --> 01:28:01.723
We're dealing with Odeo.

01:28:02.244 --> 01:28:05.726
You know, that is not before us, Altus Charter?

01:28:05.847 --> 01:28:08.469
No, Altus Institute does not operate these schools.

01:28:08.549 --> 01:28:11.611
It's not an organization involved with these schools.

01:28:11.891 --> 01:28:23.481
The school is operated by the school, Grossmont Secondary Charter School, is a part of the Odeo Charter School Corporation, which is the 501c3 corporation that operates that school.

01:28:23.921 --> 01:28:24.181
So the

01:28:25.652 --> 01:28:36.516
the org chart that's before you that lists just the three organizations with the Adeo Charter School, those three board members, that is the total and complete organization on this petition before you.

01:28:38.516 --> 01:28:44.919
Well, I'd like the school district to comment on this since they handed out this chart.

01:28:46.239 --> 01:28:49.680
And then I think board member Williams is next and maybe board member Rucker.

01:28:51.001 --> 01:28:51.361
Go ahead.

01:28:51.809 --> 01:28:53.070
Yes, I will attempt to thank you.

01:28:53.090 --> 01:28:55.873
I appreciate the opportunity to respond to your question.

01:28:57.094 --> 01:29:06.241
We attempted the petition before you doesn't disclose any of that information, but we were aware of it from being there and knowing who the players are.

01:29:06.382 --> 01:29:11.446
And so there is the purpose of the org chart that we developed, which is this was accurate at the time.

01:29:11.506 --> 01:29:12.247
It's now changed.

01:29:13.388 --> 01:29:17.135
In response to probably findings made in response to the charter.

01:29:17.596 --> 01:29:22.886
But what we were trying to illustrate is they, they proposed the charter that just showed the board this.

01:29:25.455 --> 01:29:27.536
But then the board doesn't get to see any of this.

01:29:27.796 --> 01:29:31.658
And that really impacts a school district's ability to oversee operations.

01:29:31.878 --> 01:29:42.603
Altus is a corporation that it was at one point the sole statutory member of all these underlying corporations, which means they get to add and remove board members, merge the corporation.

01:29:43.564 --> 01:29:45.445
And they did all have common board members.

01:29:45.485 --> 01:29:50.447
And at least until January, Mary Bixby, the lead administrator of this, did sit on all the boards.

01:29:51.207 --> 01:29:52.508
In the petition before you, she is

01:29:52.908 --> 01:29:53.589
the board president.

01:29:53.629 --> 01:29:54.790
That's what it says in the petition.

01:29:55.230 --> 01:30:02.175
And so she may not be that now, but that's one of the issues we've been facing is that it's a constantly moving target with information changing.

01:30:02.215 --> 01:30:06.699
And every time we try to figure like student success programs was created just last summer.

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:17.846
to separate some of this and this is going to be run by Audeo, but Audeo also operates in San Diego Unified under student success programs.

01:30:18.927 --> 01:30:28.552
You know, so that's the confusion that we're having locally trying to figure out who is operating what and when and which students, you know, all the students that came today are at the Charter School of San Diego.

01:30:30.133 --> 01:30:33.475
There is, they can, it's an independent study school, so they can continue to do that.

01:30:35.695 --> 01:30:41.657
So anyway, that is the problem is that it is very confusing and they represent that it is just this one arm.

01:30:42.238 --> 01:30:45.479
But if you do research on the organization, it is not this one arm.

01:30:45.539 --> 01:30:56.903
It is this entire organization that no one body is overseeing because the charter has taken the position that the oversight agency only gets to see from here down.

01:30:56.964 --> 01:30:58.904
And so if you only get to see from there down, that's how $600,000 goes missing.

01:31:01.458 --> 01:31:07.020
because you don't know when it gets transferred up, how it got transferred and then how it gets spent among their various organizations.

01:31:07.881 --> 01:31:10.522
And so they're not desegregated in the way that they're representing.

01:31:11.982 --> 01:31:16.044
And this chart is made from public information that we could glean that's not in the petition.

01:31:16.064 --> 01:31:17.885
Okay.

01:31:17.945 --> 01:31:18.325
Thank you.

01:31:18.725 --> 01:31:20.406
Board Member Williams is next.

01:31:23.462 --> 01:31:28.685
Well, this conversation has gone off in a direction that was different from what I originally raised my hand for.

01:31:28.745 --> 01:31:38.271
But I will say in response to member Burr's comment first and then I'll say something here in response to member Burr's comment about

01:31:39.992 --> 01:31:44.755
what might happen with all of the resource centers that applied for a waiver.

01:31:45.436 --> 01:31:49.399
My understanding is there's a wide variety of approaches that they will take.

01:31:49.999 --> 01:31:58.226
They're not all capable of turning the resource center into a new charter appeal or don't necessarily even want to do that.

01:31:59.046 --> 01:32:04.231
They may relocate, they may move a different building, they may combine students at a building.

01:32:04.251 --> 01:32:17.362
I am not at this point in time, unless Cindy tells me that, unless Cindy knows something I don't know, I'm not expecting that 20 of them are going to come up with, you know, with new petitions for new schools.

01:32:17.782 --> 01:32:19.804
So that's not something that I'm concerned about.

01:32:20.284 --> 01:32:32.272
I do hope given this conversation that just occurred that either the school or Cindy can address the current organizational chart.

01:32:32.433 --> 01:32:40.638
I do know that the word corporation sounds like a private for-profit business, but it is clear on this that it's a 501c3.

01:32:40.718 --> 01:32:42.540
It's a non-profit organization.

01:32:44.421 --> 01:32:45.863
that is at the head of it.

01:32:46.003 --> 01:32:49.388
I see that there are three different possible schools here.

01:32:50.669 --> 01:32:55.696
Cindy, do you have anything that you want to add to that discussion about the organizational chart?

01:32:56.216 --> 01:32:59.681
It may well have been, I'm going to speculate here,

01:33:00.141 --> 01:33:20.508
It may well have been that once the Shasta decision was made and this group needed to make a decision about how it was going to address, come into compliance and still serve its students well, that it did some restructuring in terms of board members and the sole statutory and that kind of thing.

01:33:20.748 --> 01:33:28.831
So that could be, well be the difference between what the district saw before and what we're seeing now.

01:33:31.667 --> 01:33:39.369
I think the only difference on this one, this one handout is there's one of the board members is not missing from what we looked at.

01:33:39.469 --> 01:33:41.110
So there might have been a change in structure.

01:33:41.150 --> 01:33:45.371
But again, it's been months and months since that petition was submitted locally.

01:33:45.451 --> 01:33:46.971
So there might have been a change.

01:33:47.071 --> 01:33:50.852
Other than that, it appears to be the same, even this larger one.

01:33:50.912 --> 01:33:58.514
I mean, these are separate 501c3s that appear to be operating their own network of charter schools.

01:33:59.074 --> 01:34:02.337
And then I think the chart is finding a common denominator between them.

01:34:02.377 --> 01:34:08.782
But the one that the petition before you is part of Odeo Charter School.

01:34:08.802 --> 01:34:12.906
So that would be the one that actually controls the school.

01:34:13.086 --> 01:34:14.787
And that's what this one looks like.

01:34:15.168 --> 01:34:18.711
So what's in the petition we found to be sufficient.

01:34:19.291 --> 01:34:21.594
other than the parent involvement.

01:34:21.854 --> 01:34:24.597
But again, you know, it's part of oversight.

01:34:25.058 --> 01:34:30.804
If it's approved, we definitely will keep our eyes open to this and ask a lot of questions on the governance.

01:34:30.904 --> 01:34:36.110
So we are finding more complicated, I think, compositions.

01:34:37.451 --> 01:34:37.712
Yes.

01:34:38.873 --> 01:34:39.794
Board Member Rucker.

01:34:41.525 --> 01:34:41.965
Okay.

01:34:42.005 --> 01:34:45.367
So we have several more hearings today.

01:34:45.948 --> 01:34:48.509
And I thought this was going to be the easy one.

01:34:48.529 --> 01:34:56.294
I was, I thought I understood this charter until everybody started talking, arguing about it.

01:34:56.735 --> 01:35:03.079
So I do have just a couple of questions and I think they are simple yes, no questions.

01:35:03.639 --> 01:35:08.342
So I do have a question for the charter, for the Audeo Charter School representatives.

01:35:11.607 --> 01:35:11.887
Okay.

01:35:11.927 --> 01:35:14.549
So I do think this is a yes, no question.

01:35:15.150 --> 01:35:18.412
You have, you do have a school, you do have a governing board.

01:35:19.093 --> 01:35:19.333
Yes.

01:35:19.553 --> 01:35:21.695
Are there parents on your governing board?

01:35:22.695 --> 01:35:23.376
Not at this time.

01:35:26.838 --> 01:35:27.459
So that's a no.

01:35:27.479 --> 01:35:30.681
There are no current parents of students, but there are parents.

01:35:31.342 --> 01:35:31.642
All right.

01:35:33.203 --> 01:35:34.444
No parents of current students.

01:35:34.464 --> 01:35:34.924
I'm lost.

01:35:35.365 --> 01:35:35.565
No.

01:35:38.311 --> 01:35:38.591
All right.

01:35:38.671 --> 01:35:40.152
So... I missed it.

01:35:40.232 --> 01:35:41.013
I don't know what he said.

01:35:41.473 --> 01:35:41.953
What did he say?

01:35:41.973 --> 01:35:42.594
Yes or no?

01:35:43.054 --> 01:35:44.355
He said not at this time.

01:35:44.735 --> 01:35:48.318
They are parents, but they're not parents of students at the schools.

01:35:48.678 --> 01:35:49.719
Ah, okay.

01:35:49.759 --> 01:35:50.459
Is that correct?

01:35:50.639 --> 01:35:51.019
Correct.

01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:51.600
All right.

01:35:51.940 --> 01:35:59.225
So you do have parents on the board, but they're not parents of the students who are attending the schools that are being governed by this board.

01:36:00.666 --> 01:36:02.307
And you said not at this time.

01:36:02.667 --> 01:36:07.650
Does not at this time mean in some way you're addressing what we heard Ms.

01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:14.094
Chan say about your governance plan concerning parent involvement?

01:36:14.715 --> 01:36:22.700
Could you, in like a couple of sentences, say what that plan is?

01:36:24.878 --> 01:36:25.919
I don't need a dissertation.

01:36:25.959 --> 01:36:30.661
I just want to know, are you planning to make sure that parents end up on the governing board?

01:36:30.881 --> 01:36:35.864
They currently have input through the LCAP process, decision making for finances.

01:36:37.225 --> 01:36:39.346
I'm not always impressed by that, but go ahead.

01:36:39.626 --> 01:36:50.232
So there is mechanisms in place and then that working with CDE and staff to cure that technical amendment, a way for there to be parental input on the board will be created.

01:36:50.737 --> 01:36:54.399
And who is it that actually has composed the members of this board?

01:36:54.419 --> 01:36:55.239
Were they appointed?

01:36:55.619 --> 01:36:59.661
Were they selected by the parents in these schools or by some other way?

01:37:01.162 --> 01:37:01.962
They are appointed.

01:37:02.182 --> 01:37:02.682
By whom?

01:37:03.823 --> 01:37:06.724
By the board member itself, but it... Wait a minute, wait.

01:37:08.625 --> 01:37:08.885
Yeah.

01:37:09.886 --> 01:37:10.306
Who are you?

01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:15.483
My name is Selena Lippi and I didn't mean any disrespect when I asked that question.

01:37:15.523 --> 01:37:18.645
So for those who thought I was being smart, but I was not.

01:37:18.685 --> 01:37:19.986
What is your position?

01:37:20.026 --> 01:37:20.306
Yes.

01:37:20.826 --> 01:37:26.470
I'm the chief business officer and the treasurer of the corporation of the Odeo Corporation.

01:37:26.650 --> 01:37:32.494
So you said for the people who are on the Odeo Charter School, they were appointed by the board?

01:37:33.715 --> 01:37:35.776
They are the board itself.

01:37:36.016 --> 01:37:37.777
They are recruited.

01:37:38.518 --> 01:37:38.918
By whom?

01:37:40.703 --> 01:37:44.968
by the leadership of the Odeo Corporation.

01:37:45.889 --> 01:37:55.260
And then they submit their information, their resume, and then it is discussed by the board members and the board members accepts the appointment.

01:37:56.662 --> 01:37:58.264
Okay, so what are the qualifications?

01:38:00.356 --> 01:38:17.441
Qualifications are minimally going to be expertise in either education, business, HR, something that would positively affect the organization, and then a commitment to promoting and carrying forth public education in California through specifically operating public charter schools.

01:38:17.681 --> 01:38:25.543
So do those qualifications have to be altered in some way for you to be able to appoint a parent from one of these, of one of the children at these schools?

01:38:25.763 --> 01:38:25.923
No.

01:38:26.423 --> 01:38:26.643
Okay.

01:38:30.529 --> 01:38:31.473
Any other questions?

01:38:31.594 --> 01:38:33.201
Are we ready for a motion on this?

01:38:34.784 --> 01:38:35.125
All right.

01:38:35.705 --> 01:38:37.747
Karen Valdez.

01:38:38.087 --> 01:38:40.208
I'm new at this second day on the job.

01:38:40.348 --> 01:38:50.936
But my question is at the local level, when we've had petitions come to my district, if you will, we could only really base everything on the petition itself.

01:38:51.116 --> 01:38:53.638
Is that still how this is that the description?

01:38:53.658 --> 01:39:01.183
So, for example, of your board, whatever you've described in the petition is what we're discussing today, not promises for future.

01:39:01.644 --> 01:39:02.564
Is that still correct?

01:39:03.505 --> 01:39:04.486
Except for the conditions.

01:39:04.526 --> 01:39:04.666
Yeah.

01:39:04.786 --> 01:39:05.006
Okay.

01:39:05.106 --> 01:39:06.227
I just wanted to understand.

01:39:06.267 --> 01:39:06.527
Thanks.

01:39:08.128 --> 01:39:08.308
Right.

01:39:08.448 --> 01:39:11.049
Board Member Ortiz-Lacon.

01:39:11.089 --> 01:39:11.930
No questions for you.

01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:14.011
Just a general request that I've been asking.

01:39:14.391 --> 01:39:15.291
I need tutorials.

01:39:15.412 --> 01:39:16.172
I need handouts.

01:39:16.232 --> 01:39:25.297
I need something that teaches me about these new structures that are coming before us so that I could better frame my thinking when I'm reading these proposals.

01:39:25.377 --> 01:39:26.978
It's getting increasingly complicated.

01:39:28.379 --> 01:39:32.842
to really understand how this is an issue or a matter of local control, who's involved.

01:39:33.102 --> 01:39:35.284
Again, my concern is never the students.

01:39:35.504 --> 01:39:39.087
Obviously, clearly they're benefiting and the teachers have the passion for it.

01:39:39.427 --> 01:39:47.113
But just understanding how this takes place in a larger context structure is becoming increasingly difficult.

01:39:47.153 --> 01:39:54.859
And I think that as folks that are tasked with approving these charter schools, we should have that understanding very clearly and upfront.

01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:55.400
Thank you.

01:39:56.553 --> 01:40:13.985
Yeah, I would add maybe we need our liaisons to work on sort of a primer on the non-profit organizations and how they're just what is not what all, you know, and how they govern and all that sort of thing.

01:40:14.025 --> 01:40:15.206
We have a hand for one of your liaisons.

01:40:15.847 --> 01:40:16.647
Yeah, hand.

01:40:17.167 --> 01:40:23.472
So, what we do though is we look at each individual petition that comes before us

01:40:24.634 --> 01:40:26.075
in its own right, in its own merit.

01:40:26.375 --> 01:40:34.359
We are not making generalizations about a whole host of organizations that represent or work with charter schools.

01:40:34.699 --> 01:40:37.120
We are looking at each petition individually.

01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:49.026
And therefore, as we do that, each of the various configurations of back office support or of various governance structures, we have to examine

01:40:49.626 --> 01:40:51.848
as individual cases before.

01:40:52.428 --> 01:41:02.376
In this particular case, I do believe that the final chart, the chart that's a part of the petition and the one that was passed out to us is the official one.

01:41:03.137 --> 01:41:11.123
And if this charter is approved today by us, that is the governance structure that this charter school must live with from this point forward.

01:41:11.443 --> 01:41:15.366
And if it does change from that, it's a material revision and would have to come back before the board.

01:41:15.606 --> 01:41:17.987
Yes, I was not speaking about this petition.

01:41:18.567 --> 01:41:21.208
And I don't know how to, and I don't think you were either.

01:41:21.309 --> 01:41:24.530
No, this has nothing to do with this petition.

01:41:24.650 --> 01:41:32.433
It has to do with understanding the law and some of the aspects of it.

01:41:32.513 --> 01:41:38.216
I think, you know, nothing to do with this petition because I think members are getting more confused about

01:41:39.739 --> 01:41:42.241
about this issue and how it operates.

01:41:43.602 --> 01:41:45.643
We don't want to mix it up with this petition.

01:41:45.683 --> 01:41:46.204
That's correct.

01:41:46.264 --> 01:41:49.146
That's what I'm trying to do is not mix that discussion up with this.

01:41:49.206 --> 01:41:50.327
Yeah, exactly.

01:41:50.347 --> 01:41:55.470
Right now where I'd like to make a motion and that motion is to approve the Gross-Mott appeal.

01:41:56.070 --> 01:42:00.173
I move the staff recommendation with all the conditions and technical amendments.

01:42:00.894 --> 01:42:01.314
I second.

01:42:02.205 --> 01:42:04.046
All right, is there any further board discussion?

01:42:04.947 --> 01:42:06.668
Not all those, raise your hands.

01:42:08.009 --> 01:42:13.573
Okay, we have... Do we have six?

01:42:14.274 --> 01:42:14.514
Yes.

01:42:17.536 --> 01:42:19.658
Okay, so we better call the roll here, yeah.

01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:25.442
Okay, Bruce Holliday?

01:42:25.602 --> 01:42:25.802
Yes.

01:42:26.583 --> 01:42:27.303
Nikki Sandoval?

01:42:27.323 --> 01:42:27.403
Yes.

01:42:28.484 --> 01:42:29.185
Karen Valdez?

01:42:30.774 --> 01:42:31.715
Olivia Sison?

01:42:31.895 --> 01:42:32.035
Yes.

01:42:32.716 --> 01:42:33.377
Trish Williams?

01:42:33.457 --> 01:42:33.677
Yes.

01:42:35.179 --> 01:42:35.699
Mike Kerse?

01:42:35.859 --> 01:42:36.160
Yes.

01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:37.341
Eileen Strauss?

01:42:37.361 --> 01:42:37.421
Yes.

01:42:38.142 --> 01:42:38.642
Sue Burr?

01:42:38.843 --> 01:42:39.063
Yes.

01:42:39.543 --> 01:42:41.205
Felice Ortiz-Lacon?

01:42:41.766 --> 01:42:43.568
Yes, with a condition, correct?

01:42:43.608 --> 01:42:43.808
Yes.

01:42:44.669 --> 01:42:45.570
And Pat Rucker?

01:42:46.350 --> 01:42:46.551
No.

01:42:50.295 --> 01:42:50.735
We have eight.

01:42:51.095 --> 01:42:53.418
We have eight, so the petition is approved.

01:43:02.839 --> 01:43:03.319
Okay.

01:43:03.339 --> 01:43:06.702
So we want to take a break or?

01:43:07.622 --> 01:43:09.684
Yeah, maybe we better.

01:43:09.784 --> 01:43:11.505
Okay.

01:43:12.306 --> 01:43:19.530
The board will take a 10-minute break and reconvene at 1025.

01:43:19.570 --> 01:43:21.192
A little less than 10 minutes.

01:43:27.996 --> 01:43:31.359
So the board will reconvene and we're now ready for

01:43:32.674 --> 01:43:37.117
Item 17 concerning the Celerity Dyad Charter School.

01:43:37.458 --> 01:43:39.980
Cindy Chan will present for CDE.

01:43:46.449 --> 01:43:49.731
But this one is going to be a little bit longer than the last one.

01:43:49.871 --> 01:43:53.833
So, yeah, this one is the more difficult one.

01:43:53.853 --> 01:43:55.134
I think it's a little more complicated.

01:43:55.974 --> 01:43:59.236
So this, we've gone through one of six today.

01:43:59.856 --> 01:44:03.678
Before you, you have four renewals and this is one of the renewals that you'll hear.

01:44:03.738 --> 01:44:05.959
And this one was denied locally.

01:44:06.099 --> 01:44:10.422
So again, Cindy Chan, Director of the Charter Schools Division at the California Department of Education.

01:44:11.142 --> 01:44:24.495
Item 17 is an appeal by Celerity Dyad Charter School to renew the charter school which was denied by the Los Angeles Unified School District and not considered by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.

01:44:24.515 --> 01:44:31.642
Therefore the charter school appealed to the state and the CD received the appeal on December 12th.

01:44:32.803 --> 01:44:43.508
Based on review of the petition documents and the information submitted, we are recommending that the State Board hold a public hearing and thereafter approve with technical amendments in six conditions.

01:44:44.268 --> 01:44:49.450
The request to renew celerity dyad under the oversight of the State Board for a five-year term.

01:44:50.311 --> 01:44:54.633
Effective July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2022.

01:44:54.833 --> 01:45:00.035
So as part of the approval, I'm going to read through the six conditions that we are recommending.

01:45:02.469 --> 01:45:27.275
So Celerity Educational Group, which I'll refer to as CEG, may only continue to contract with Celerity Global Development, which I will refer to as Global, for goods and or services if CEG and Global agree to timely respond to all CDE inquiries into CEG's and Global's operations, including but not limited to

01:45:28.275 --> 01:45:50.316
Management, Fiscal, Personnel, Procurement, Facilities, Operations, Facilities Financing and Programmatic Services in accordance with Education Code Section 47604.3 and fully cooperate with any investigation into their operations conducted pursuant to Education Code Section 47604.4.

01:45:53.298 --> 01:46:01.285
Condition 2, CEG will provide drafts of all proposed management and vendor contracts between CEG and Global.

01:46:02.065 --> 01:46:10.933
Any affiliate of CEG or Global or any other related party to CEG or Global for CDE approval prior to execution.

01:46:12.434 --> 01:46:23.580
Condition 3, CEG will provide drafts of all proposed loans including but not limited to interagency loans with full detail of the purpose of the loan, loan repayment,

01:46:25.594 --> 01:46:31.578
and interest and the method of how the loans are secured for CD approval prior to execution.

01:46:32.558 --> 01:46:48.127
Condition four, CEG will provide drafts of all proposed transfers of assets or liabilities including but not limited to interagency transfers with full detail of the purpose and allowed uses of the transfers for CD approval prior to execution.

01:46:49.467 --> 01:46:56.550
Condition 5, CEG will contract with an agency approved by the CDE for a comprehensive management audit.

01:46:57.331 --> 01:47:12.377
In addition to reviewing the operations of CEG, the audit also will review the operations of Global as they relate to the services and support that Global provides CEG and the use of the funds CEG provides Global for those services.

01:47:13.559 --> 01:47:18.527
CEG will provide the CDE monthly updates from the auditor on the status of the audit.

01:47:18.667 --> 01:47:25.699
And upon completion, the auditor's final comprehensive report on the day the auditor provides the report to CEG.

01:47:27.765 --> 01:47:36.787
Within one month of its receipt of the auditor's report, CEG will provide the CDE with a plan approved by its governing board to resolve any audit findings.

01:47:37.448 --> 01:47:45.310
And lastly, CEG will adhere to the terms and conditions of a memorandum of understanding between Solarity Dyad and the State Board.

01:47:46.990 --> 01:48:03.560
So at the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools meeting on April 5th, the ACCS considered this celerity diet petition and due to concerns of recent information about CEG, the CDE had not formed a recommendation at that time of the meeting.

01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:06.982
That's something very, very rare that we do.

01:48:07.022 --> 01:48:12.806
We usually have a recommendation formed for the board at the ACCS meeting, but in this case we didn't.

01:48:13.807 --> 01:48:27.562
We had posed a number of questions that were intended to encourage a discussion at the Advisory Commission amongst the commissioners that we believe would help us to form a recommendation for the State Board.

01:48:28.563 --> 01:48:38.574
However, since the questions were not provided to the commissioners and petitioners in advance of the meeting, there was very little discussion around our concerns.

01:48:38.634 --> 01:48:44.920
It was a very long discussion, but we had specific concerns that really weren't addressed by the dialogue.

01:48:45.741 --> 01:48:55.767
So after the discussion and questions that the commissioners had of their own, the ACC has voted to recommend that the state would consider the following elements.

01:48:56.668 --> 01:48:58.669
So this is the motion that I'm going to read to you.

01:48:59.590 --> 01:49:09.956
Number one, that the commission applauds the academic success and accomplishments that Solarity has achieved, which is by law the most important consideration for renewal.

01:49:11.156 --> 01:49:23.439
In order for this commission to conceptually support renewal, we would insist that the school adequately answer all the questions posed by the CD staff to the CD's full satisfaction.

01:49:23.619 --> 01:49:39.022
And if and only if those questions are answered to the full satisfaction of the CD staff, such that CD staff makes an affirmative recommendation for renewal, then we conceptually support that recommendation for renewal.

01:49:40.563 --> 01:49:52.508
And conversely, if the CD staff does not get adequate answers to their questions that fully answer their questions to their satisfaction, then this body would support recommendation for denial.

01:49:53.208 --> 01:49:55.850
And the motion passed with six votes and one abstention.

01:49:57.196 --> 01:50:05.378
So I'm going to give you some background and kind of jump to, this is going to connect to our condition and concerns at the end.

01:50:05.418 --> 01:50:18.782
But because it's a chronology, I thought it'd be important to kind of just briefly go through some really key events and things that happened that kind of led us to where we are today with our condition and our concerns.

01:50:19.921 --> 01:50:24.324
So I'm going to start with the November 2016 State Board meeting.

01:50:24.964 --> 01:50:34.311
And if you recall, petitions for the establishment of Celerity-Himalaya Charter School and Celerity-Rolos Charter School were approved at that meeting.

01:50:35.191 --> 01:50:39.694
These were to establish new charter schools under Celerity Educational Group.

01:50:40.615 --> 01:50:48.341
We presented specific concerns with the governance structure of CEG and its affiliates, including but not limited to global.

01:50:49.382 --> 01:50:55.647
At that meeting, both schools were approved with the following condition that was applicable to both charter schools.

01:50:56.747 --> 01:51:01.050
And it's very similar to the one that we're proposing for this position.

01:51:01.671 --> 01:51:25.607
CEG may only continue to contract with Global for goods and or services if CEG and Global agree to timely respond to all CD inquiries into CEG's and Global's operations including but not limited to management, fiscal, personnel, procurement, facilities operations and financing, programmatic services in accordance with the two education sections that I mentioned.

01:51:26.848 --> 01:51:41.422
On January 4th, 2017, the scope of services in the agreement for limited services between CEG and Global was amended to include the condition that the State Board approved for the two charter schools.

01:51:41.502 --> 01:51:45.306
So that was written into the agreement signed by both parties in early January.

01:51:46.807 --> 01:52:08.238
In early January 2017, it came to our attention through various public sources, through media reports that were distributed out there, that there were allegations against CEG and or one or more of its affiliates of fiscal mismanagement, inappropriate related party transactions, and misuse of public funds.

01:52:09.478 --> 01:52:17.364
On January 30th, CEG sent a letter to the CDE informing us of an investigation being conducted by the U.S.

01:52:17.404 --> 01:52:24.929
Department of Education involving CEG and that agents had retrieved documents from CEG's administrative offices.

01:52:26.349 --> 01:52:43.939
On March 2nd, the CDE sent a letter to CEG regarding the federal investigation of CEG and requested that CEG provide a listing, summary, and or description of all documents retrieved by the federal agencies from CEG, Global, and any affiliates of CEG.

01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:57.431
and a summary of all related party contracts and transactions entered into by CEG Global, any affiliates of CEG and any affiliates of Global for the current and prior fiscal years.

01:52:58.572 --> 01:53:11.264
On March 10th, CEG provided the CD with a response letter with a general description of the documents retrieved, including business records, financial and accounting records, and some miscellaneous documents.

01:53:12.324 --> 01:53:19.127
Additionally, the letter provided a brief description of five affiliates and related party contracts of CEG and or global.

01:53:19.628 --> 01:53:21.168
It's more detailed in the item.

01:53:21.268 --> 01:53:22.189
It's fairly long.

01:53:23.763 --> 01:53:33.048
On April 7th, the CDE sends a letter to CEG regarding requests for additional documents to address the questions CD expressed at the ACCS meeting.

01:53:33.088 --> 01:53:44.314
So we gave them the opportunity, we presented the questions again, gave them the opportunity to respond so that we could look at information for, to present to the State Board.

01:53:45.294 --> 01:53:50.180
On April 18th, CEG provided the CD with documents, response to the CD letter.

01:53:50.781 --> 01:54:03.336
We reviewed the submission and on April 20th, we actually met with CEG and they brought with them a board member and staff from the organization, their legal counsel.

01:54:04.377 --> 01:54:06.659
And we went through the documents that they submitted.

01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:24.394
We had a long discussion with them about the documents, including their contracts, services contract with Global, CEG's dependency on Global, the appropriateness and the ability to sever CEG's contract with Global,

01:54:25.554 --> 01:54:35.620
CEG Board's oversight of their contracts with Global, the reasonableness of the fees and amounts paid to Global for back office and other services.

01:54:37.221 --> 01:54:37.502
On May 2nd,

01:54:39.969 --> 01:54:44.070
This was after the board, the board item was posted.

01:54:44.110 --> 01:54:59.834
CEG provided the CD with letters from the Compton Unified School District and Western Association of Schools and Colleges citing concerns regarding the federal investigation and other allegations that have been produced in the various media reports.

01:55:00.934 --> 01:55:19.250
So as noted in the item, the April 26 letter from WASC to CEG was notification of potential withholding of accreditation status for all CEG schools for violations concerning substantive changes, integrity of member schools, and disclosure of information.

01:55:20.170 --> 01:55:30.737
The WASC letter indicates they have reason to believe that the investigations of CEG and the search of its headquarters are related to suspicions of illegal activities at CEG.

01:55:31.637 --> 01:55:35.600
WASC is issued in order to show cause as to why the accreditation

01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:40.102
Status of all CEG schools should not be withheld.

01:55:40.422 --> 01:56:00.232
Further, WASC has required CEG to complete an independent audit to verify CEG's stability, compliance with state and federal tax laws, and internal controls to prevent fraud, misuse of public funds, nepotism, and conflicts of interest if an independent audit has not already been planned or completed.

01:56:01.452 --> 01:56:09.534
Also, CEG has been directed to provide the results of the independent audit and other requested information to us by June 2nd.

01:56:11.575 --> 01:56:16.356
So kind of moving off of that, going into our analysis of the petition.

01:56:16.976 --> 01:56:20.837
The first thing that we start with is looking at the renewal criteria.

01:56:20.937 --> 01:56:29.800
So this is one element that's required that we have to perform, an authorizer has to perform that's over and above that for an establishment of a new petition.

01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:39.069
So the renewal criteria, which we call the standard criteria for renewal, which is that which has existed for many years, consists mainly of the API data.

01:56:39.089 --> 01:56:40.070
It's still relevant.

01:56:40.631 --> 01:56:49.821
So a charter authorizer is required to consider increases in pupil academic achievement for all groups of pupils served by the charter school as the most important factor for renewal.

01:56:51.022 --> 01:56:59.708
Pursuant to statute, a charter school that's been in operation for at least four years shall meet at least one of the five criteria related to academic performance.

01:57:00.188 --> 01:57:02.589
They're listed in detail on page seven of the item.

01:57:04.030 --> 01:57:14.217
We find that Solarity Dyad has met four of the five criteria and thus has demonstrated increases in pupil academic achievement and has met that requirement.

01:57:15.497 --> 01:57:23.602
Statute further requires that we independently review the renewal petition and all the documents that were submitted to the local school district.

01:57:24.403 --> 01:57:44.035
As part of our review of a charter petition, we must determine whether the petition sufficiently meets the required statutory requirements that include but are not limited to whether the charter school presents a sound educational program, that the petition contains reasonably comprehensive descriptions of the required elements,

01:57:44.535 --> 01:57:48.477
and that the petitioners are able to successfully implement the intended program.

01:57:49.177 --> 01:57:56.580
A lack of sufficiency in one or more area may form the basis for a finding of facts supporting grounds for denial.

01:57:58.635 --> 01:58:17.405
The Solarity Dyad educational model offers pupils the opportunity to be challenged in a small, safe school environment where high expectations, academic excellence, and mutual respect will be non-negotiable and where parents and teachers work in partnership to meet achievement goals of pupils.

01:58:17.425 --> 01:58:24.769
Solarity Dyad is proposing to serve approximately 700 pupils in transitional kindergarten through grade eight.

01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:36.112
The Charter School provides a site-based matriculation setting with a commitment to increasing the achievement of at-risk pupils from communities in need within LAUSD.

01:58:37.432 --> 01:58:53.796
Based on a review of the Solarity Dyad petition documents, we find the petition adequately describes the educational program and addresses how it will serve Solarity Dyad's target student population with the addition of some of our recommended technical amendments.

01:58:55.091 --> 01:59:06.047
We also find that the petition provides an adequate description of the multiple required elements, noting that we have identified some or we're recommending technical amendment in that area.

01:59:07.108 --> 01:59:10.794
Regarding the petitioner's ability to successfully implement the program.

01:59:11.875 --> 01:59:16.677
For this particular criterion, the regulations contain a number of factors that must be considered.

01:59:17.637 --> 01:59:19.838
One of these factors is the financial plan.

01:59:20.358 --> 01:59:32.763
We have reviewed the petitioner's multi-year budget and after applying our assumptions and adjustments to revenues and expenditures, we find the plan to be reasonably sufficient to support the intended program.

01:59:34.122 --> 01:59:38.046
Another very critical factor is the capacity of the petitioner.

01:59:39.728 --> 01:59:49.977
We find that the Solarity Dyad petition presents a governance structure that may compromise the petitioner's ability to successfully implement the intended program.

01:59:50.638 --> 01:59:53.559
So at this point, I wish I had a handout, but I don't.

01:59:53.960 --> 01:59:56.961
So I'm going to walk you through the governance structure.

01:59:56.981 --> 02:00:01.223
And you may recall this from the last time because it's not different, but it's very complicated.

02:00:01.303 --> 02:00:06.125
So I think it would help to walk through it and try to describe it.

02:00:07.126 --> 02:00:14.629
And it was the basis for the recommended condition that we proposed for celerity Himalaya and celerity Rolos.

02:00:14.830 --> 02:00:19.332
Continues to be a concern because it's the same for celerity Dayan.

02:00:20.272 --> 02:00:25.214
And please keep in mind that Solarity operates nine schools, seven of which are currently active.

02:00:25.694 --> 02:00:30.216
The governance structure proposed reflects what the current practice is for all of the schools.

02:00:31.257 --> 02:00:35.659
Okay, so we're going to start with the first, what I call the layer.

02:00:35.779 --> 02:00:41.181
So we have the charter school and then the body that oversees the charter school is Solarity.

02:00:42.041 --> 02:00:42.442
Oh, OK.

02:00:43.162 --> 02:00:43.262
OK.

02:00:43.302 --> 02:00:43.402
OK.

02:00:43.422 --> 02:00:44.063
So, OK.

02:00:44.283 --> 02:00:45.964
Charter School is the box.

02:00:46.105 --> 02:00:49.347
And then above that, Celerity Educational Group.

02:00:50.008 --> 02:00:57.393
The Celerity Dyad will be operated by CEG, which is a non-profit public benefit corporation.

02:00:58.254 --> 02:01:06.500
The affairs of the Charter School will be managed and its powers exercised under the ultimate jurisdiction of CEG's Board of Trustees.

02:01:07.661 --> 02:01:14.406
The CEG board will have ultimate responsibility for the operation and activities of Solarity Dyad.

02:01:15.687 --> 02:01:20.830
So for example, I'll give you some of the board's major roles and responsibilities that they have.

02:01:21.491 --> 02:01:35.160
Establishing and approving all major educational and operational policies, approving all major contracts, approving the Solarity Dyad annual budget, and also overseeing the school's fiscal affairs.

02:01:36.723 --> 02:01:42.340
Sort of as background, real briefly, maybe for your study that you're going to do later.

02:01:43.346 --> 02:01:51.094
Current law allows charter schools to elect to operate as or be operated by a non-profit public benefit corporation.

02:01:52.014 --> 02:02:07.049
This form of governance structure we have found, we don't see all the petitions, we don't look at them, but this one is not uncommon where you have a non-profit public benefit corporation such as a charter management organization that operates more than one charter school.

02:02:08.564 --> 02:02:16.150
Okay, so now we're going to go this next layer, next box, which is celerity global development, which I've been referring to as global.

02:02:16.571 --> 02:02:18.933
This is the sole statutory member.

02:02:19.873 --> 02:02:23.797
So celerity dyads governing bylaws indicate that global

02:02:24.757 --> 02:02:33.087
another separate nonprofit public benefit corporation shall serve as a sole statutory member of CEG.

02:02:33.928 --> 02:02:40.516
So as sole statutory member, Global's rights include approving the elected CEG trustees,

02:02:42.179 --> 02:02:46.661
That's approving, not appointing, because I think that was a point of difference last time.

02:02:46.761 --> 02:03:03.150
So approving the elected CEG trustees, removal of elected trustees, approving the disposition of all or substantially all of CEG's assets, approving any merger and its principal terms in any amendment of those terms,

02:03:03.810 --> 02:03:06.872
and on any election to dissolve CEG.

02:03:07.773 --> 02:03:16.879
So a comment that we have found that this form of governance structure does exist with other charter schools, but it's not as common.

02:03:16.939 --> 02:03:18.299
It's not one that we see as often.

02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:23.363
I think the one with just the CEG component is more common.

02:03:24.724 --> 02:03:28.527
Okay, another layer, but now we're kind of going off to the side here.

02:03:28.787 --> 02:03:34.191
So we have the sole statutory, we have CEG, and then we have the charter.

02:03:34.231 --> 02:03:37.794
Now I'm kind of connecting the box to the side.

02:03:38.274 --> 02:03:41.136
We have global still as a vendor.

02:03:41.957 --> 02:03:55.366
So in addition to Global's role as sole statutory member of CEG, CEG contracts with Global for various services for all of the charter schools overseas, which would include the current ones that already died in.

02:03:56.147 --> 02:04:11.717
These services include, but are not limited to, management, staff development, supervisory oversight, fiscal services, human resources, procurement, information technology, and facilities operations and financing.

02:04:13.118 --> 02:04:37.097
As Global serves as the sole statutory member of CEG and is a contracted vendor of CEG as well, we have had concerns that this control affords, that affords one of CEG's primary vendors over the CEG board presents the potential for a conflict of interest that puts at risk the charter school's future operational health.

02:04:38.218 --> 02:04:43.321
This was also a concern noted by LAUSD in the review of the charter petition.

02:04:44.562 --> 02:04:52.147
So that structure, which we had the concern before, added to the recent concerns is kind of where we're at today.

02:04:52.447 --> 02:05:05.015
So in addition to the noted concerns with the governor structure, the recent information that I provided to you through the chronology has elevated our concerns to a higher level.

02:05:05.835 --> 02:05:13.299
And this is due to the recent public allegations, the ongoing federal investigation, and additional information provided by CEG.

02:05:13.339 --> 02:05:15.580
And they've been very responsive, I want to note.

02:05:16.961 --> 02:05:31.669
Of the numerous related party contracts and transactions entered into by CEG Global and their affiliates, we are concerned on how this may affect the ability of the petitioner to successfully implement the program.

02:05:32.869 --> 02:05:51.141
However, since we do not have any official reports, I mean these are media reports, we have reached out to the Office of Inspector General who's been performing this investigation and it's, there's no information that's passed on from that.

02:05:51.161 --> 02:05:56.625
It's an ongoing investigation and they're not in a position to have a dialogue about that.

02:05:57.385 --> 02:05:59.447
So there's been no other official reports.

02:05:59.487 --> 02:06:14.238
There have been no formal management reviews or have been no forensic audits that we have that we could bring forward that substantiate with factual findings that fraud or fiscal mismanagement exists within the organizations.

02:06:15.139 --> 02:06:22.424
Therefore, we are at a point where we are recommending approval of the renewal petition, but with the conditions that we proposed.

02:06:23.445 --> 02:06:33.733
We believe that our recommended conditions are prudent given our concerns of the governance structure and the relationship of the CEG board and global.

02:06:34.413 --> 02:06:45.081
And the conditions are also intended to serve as part of our monitoring that we would have if the charter schools approved for our oversight of the charter school.

02:06:46.162 --> 02:06:59.350
Therefore, we recommend that the State Board hold a public hearing to approve the petition to establish Solarity Dyad under the oversight of the State Board with the proposed technical amendments and the conditions that I've mentioned.

02:07:00.631 --> 02:07:08.035
I know that the Solarity petitioner is here and also representatives from Los Angeles Unified School District are here to present to the Board.

02:07:08.556 --> 02:07:11.237
So, if you have any questions, I can answer or... Here.

02:07:11.257 --> 02:07:12.898
Am I here?

02:07:14.284 --> 02:07:15.005
Yes, go ahead.

02:07:16.506 --> 02:07:17.126
Board member Burr.

02:07:19.028 --> 02:07:23.011
Thank you for walking through this so carefully, Cindy, and laying this all out.

02:07:23.031 --> 02:07:23.831
It was very helpful.

02:07:23.892 --> 02:07:26.173
And I do have a little graphic that I drew.

02:07:26.894 --> 02:07:30.697
But I don't know what sole statutory member means.

02:07:30.937 --> 02:07:34.660
And I don't and there must be some term of art there.

02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:37.702
And I don't know if that's something that council wants to answer or

02:07:38.803 --> 02:07:51.654
But it sounds like when you say here's a board of directors, there's a board that governs CEG, which I assume is some number of members, but then you go up to global development and you call it the sole statutory member.

02:07:51.894 --> 02:07:52.615
What is it?

02:07:53.376 --> 02:07:55.738
Is that a body composed of people?

02:07:55.758 --> 02:07:57.439
Nick looks like he wants to answer this.

02:08:02.157 --> 02:08:05.318
This is Nick Schweitzer, Deputy Superintendent.

02:08:05.338 --> 02:08:08.259
So, yeah, I've looked into this a bit.

02:08:08.319 --> 02:08:13.720
So, most corporate entities, they consist of shareholders.

02:08:15.680 --> 02:08:19.902
Non-profit corporations, of course, do not have shareholders.

02:08:20.642 --> 02:08:24.183
Instead, they generally have a membership.

02:08:26.143 --> 02:08:29.144
In the case of a lot of non-profits,

02:08:30.114 --> 02:08:33.581
they don't have a membership and said they have a single member.

02:08:34.303 --> 02:08:38.572
So that's when we refer to a sole statutory member.

02:08:39.392 --> 02:08:42.815
that means that global is the single member.

02:08:42.935 --> 02:08:56.546
So, you know, for for-profit corporations, the shareholders get to vote on various issues relating to the governments and purpose of the corporation.

02:08:56.686 --> 02:09:03.652
For non-profit entities that have a membership base, those members get to vote on

02:09:05.737 --> 02:09:15.364
issues related to the corporation for the sole statutory member as is laid out in their corporate bylaws.

02:09:16.305 --> 02:09:35.380
The sole member gets to exercise control over the actual board of directors as a membership base would for a non-profit that has a membership base or shareholders would do for a for-profit corporation.

02:09:37.401 --> 02:09:37.641
Okay.

02:09:37.842 --> 02:09:39.804
Board Member Rucker, then Board Member Williams.

02:09:41.906 --> 02:09:42.808
It's my turn.

02:09:42.868 --> 02:09:43.248
Thank you.

02:09:43.268 --> 02:09:45.591
Yeah, it's the... Sorry.

02:09:46.652 --> 02:09:50.517
So with this sole statutory member, I want to make sure I understood what you just said.

02:09:50.577 --> 02:09:54.562
They have some oversight over the CEG board.

02:09:54.622 --> 02:09:55.323
Is that correct?

02:09:56.061 --> 02:09:56.361
Yes.

02:09:56.641 --> 02:09:59.202
Do they appoint the members of the CEG board?

02:09:59.262 --> 02:10:03.383
They do not appoint the members, but they do approve who is appointed.

02:10:03.543 --> 02:10:08.844
So the board, the board itself appoints its own members, which is not uncommon.

02:10:09.024 --> 02:10:09.384
Right.

02:10:09.564 --> 02:10:11.204
For non-profits.

02:10:11.665 --> 02:10:17.186
So the board itself appoints its own members and then CEGlobal.

02:10:17.486 --> 02:10:17.946
Global.

02:10:18.006 --> 02:10:19.826
To approve of those appointments.

02:10:20.087 --> 02:10:21.787
Is global in any other way?

02:10:22.347 --> 02:10:24.469
Have any other control?

02:10:24.489 --> 02:10:26.890
Let me finish the question.

02:10:27.351 --> 02:10:33.335
Have any other control over the policies or the decisions of the CEG board?

02:10:34.871 --> 02:10:44.158
Not, not directly through, through their ability to, you know, appoint and remove or approve appointments and remove members.

02:10:44.218 --> 02:10:45.879
They can remove members.

02:10:45.959 --> 02:10:48.221
So the board has the authority to appoint them.

02:10:48.902 --> 02:10:53.806
Global can approve them and Global has the sole authority to remove them?

02:10:53.826 --> 02:10:54.626
I believe so.

02:10:54.666 --> 02:10:55.527
Is that, yeah.

02:10:55.787 --> 02:10:57.749
I believe that's what the bylaws are.

02:10:57.769 --> 02:11:00.030
Does Global approve the,

02:11:00.771 --> 02:11:04.157
budget for CEG's charter schools?

02:11:05.099 --> 02:11:09.327
I do not believe they, they, they don't have data that

02:11:10.580 --> 02:11:12.701
responsibility based on the bylaws.

02:11:12.781 --> 02:11:13.982
It's the board itself.

02:11:14.262 --> 02:11:14.523
Okay.

02:11:14.583 --> 02:11:26.010
And the CEG board approves the contract that pays the consulting and all these other services that Global is the, it receives the financial remuneration for?

02:11:26.270 --> 02:11:26.650
Correct.

02:11:27.030 --> 02:11:30.753
And this is the board that Global can remove members from?

02:11:31.133 --> 02:11:31.573
Correct.

02:11:31.933 --> 02:11:32.214
Okay.

02:11:33.755 --> 02:11:34.015
Okay.

02:11:34.315 --> 02:11:35.496
I clearly understand.

02:11:35.516 --> 02:11:37.957
Board Member Williams.

02:11:37.977 --> 02:11:39.078
Trish and Eileen.

02:11:40.740 --> 02:11:44.465
So this is for you, Nick, with that explanation of nonprofits.

02:11:45.105 --> 02:11:47.829
I ran a nonprofit in California for 20 years.

02:11:48.870 --> 02:11:53.676
And we didn't have we because we weren't a membership.

02:11:54.853 --> 02:12:02.456
You talk about nonprofits having members and some do, you know, membership associations have members.

02:12:03.637 --> 02:12:07.999
But a lot of nonprofits just have an executive director, staff, and a board.

02:12:08.319 --> 02:12:08.559
True.

02:12:09.499 --> 02:12:11.460
And so that's what we had and

02:12:13.061 --> 02:12:15.682
So there was no sole statutory member.

02:12:16.142 --> 02:12:18.763
It is true that nonprofit boards are self-appointing.

02:12:18.803 --> 02:12:21.883
They usually are drawn to the mission of the organization.

02:12:22.244 --> 02:12:25.484
They are brought on as the organization evolves over time.

02:12:26.185 --> 02:12:28.285
We need a stronger finance person on.

02:12:28.385 --> 02:12:31.226
We need somebody that can help us with marketing.

02:12:31.286 --> 02:12:32.526
We need some donors.

02:12:32.646 --> 02:12:34.527
You know, that's very, very common.

02:12:35.187 --> 02:12:40.468
The thing I was not familiar with was this sole statutory member.

02:12:41.089 --> 02:12:42.069
I know it's legal.

02:12:43.150 --> 02:12:53.798
At least I've heard that it's legal, but it does appear, but I don't know what its purpose is in a charter organizational structure.

02:12:54.358 --> 02:12:57.340
It must serve a useful kind of purpose.

02:12:58.201 --> 02:13:01.303
It's not done often, but it's, we've heard of them recently.

02:13:01.704 --> 02:13:04.506
It must serve a useful kind of purpose to do that.

02:13:04.586 --> 02:13:05.547
Do you know what that would be?

02:13:06.407 --> 02:13:23.901
I think where I've seen in sort of, you know, doing my own little bit of research on this, you know, I've seen it, it's useful when you have sort of several different organizations that are related to each other and supporting each other.

02:13:24.361 --> 02:13:27.804
And so it sort of maintains that connection between the organizations.

02:13:29.619 --> 02:13:34.931
So I, you know, I don't know whether that is truly necessary in this instance.

02:13:38.079 --> 02:13:38.880
Board Member Strauss.

02:13:39.857 --> 02:13:41.919
So I did also draw my own.

02:13:42.299 --> 02:13:43.400
I think it looks a little different.

02:13:43.860 --> 02:13:44.861
I tried really hard to write.

02:13:45.161 --> 02:13:49.044
So that'd be helpful in the future when there's a lot of different or just to help us understand it.

02:13:49.504 --> 02:13:58.290
But so I understand the CEG has a board and I understand and appreciate Member Rucker's clarification of the authority that Global has over CEG.

02:13:58.751 --> 02:14:00.632
My question is who is Global?

02:14:00.692 --> 02:14:01.873
Is that the CEO?

02:14:02.073 --> 02:14:03.694
Is there three people?

02:14:03.794 --> 02:14:04.595
Who is Global?

02:14:04.835 --> 02:14:11.203
So Global has its separate non-profit, has its own governing board.

02:14:13.005 --> 02:14:21.355
Presuming that that governing board would act on behalf of Global to approve the appointments to CEG.

02:14:26.448 --> 02:14:28.289
And what's the role of the executive director?

02:14:28.369 --> 02:14:33.733
Just works for that board like a non-profit executive director would work for a board?

02:14:34.133 --> 02:14:41.258
I'm just trying to understand all the players here to clarify, kind of build on what Member Rucker was trying to, I mean, that's what we're trying to figure out is how all these pieces fit together.

02:14:41.278 --> 02:14:43.960
Yeah, I, yes.

02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:50.485
So that the executive director would be, act as the CEO of the entity.

02:14:52.304 --> 02:14:52.984
Which entity?

02:14:53.745 --> 02:14:56.666
Whichever entity they're the executive director of.

02:14:56.726 --> 02:15:01.649
So executive director, president, whatever you want to call it, the CEO of the organization.

02:15:04.771 --> 02:15:07.152
Okay, board member Williams, were you next?

02:15:07.552 --> 02:15:09.993
So Pat, Trish and Karen.

02:15:10.614 --> 02:15:11.354
And Baraka.

02:15:13.255 --> 02:15:16.717
Who, does the executive director have a vote with the board members?

02:15:17.837 --> 02:15:25.759
I don't, you know, I don't know what is the role of the executive director for Global.

02:15:27.219 --> 02:15:46.444
I don't believe they have a vote for CEG, but I don't know that would not be the case, but I would presume it would depend on the bylaws of that entity as to what the authority and role is of the executive director or CEO of that organization is.

02:15:46.812 --> 02:15:58.515
And these were the questions I had the last time when we had the meeting in November because the governing structure that as explained today was the governing structure that I understood in November.

02:15:58.936 --> 02:16:12.219
But what I have never been clear on is what the authority the executive director has as an employee either of CEG or of global in contracting with global services.

02:16:12.780 --> 02:16:13.640
If the C, if the,

02:16:14.680 --> 02:16:17.542
Now the acronyms are beginning to get mixed up in my head.

02:16:18.243 --> 02:16:32.733
If the chief executive officer is an employee of Global, but is doing the actual contracting of the work that CEG pays Global for,

02:16:33.433 --> 02:16:34.314
That's one thing.

02:16:34.874 --> 02:17:00.013
But if the chief executive officer is an employee of CEG and works with the board to develop the contract that goes back to global for the, that gives money back to global, and global is the one that both appoints the CEO and can remove board members, just as I did in November, I think I smell a rat.

02:17:00.836 --> 02:17:09.161
So CEG and CGD both have separate CEOs.

02:17:09.441 --> 02:17:09.762
Okay.

02:17:10.322 --> 02:17:16.206
But who is the employee, who is the employer of the CEO?

02:17:17.631 --> 02:17:19.352
for C.E.G.

02:17:19.733 --> 02:17:20.413
C.E.G.

02:17:20.493 --> 02:17:22.214
So the CEO of C.E.G.

02:17:22.274 --> 02:17:24.016
is appointed by the board of C.E.G.

02:17:24.376 --> 02:17:29.860
He's appointed by the board of C.E.G., the board that C.D.G.

02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:30.800
can remove.

02:17:31.101 --> 02:17:31.661
That's correct.

02:17:31.761 --> 02:17:32.101
OK.

02:17:32.502 --> 02:17:33.222
So, OK.

02:17:33.722 --> 02:17:44.390
So by relationships, in the same way that my mother's brother is in some way related to me or my grandmother's brother is some way related to me, that would make the CEO

02:17:46.171 --> 02:17:48.794
of CEG, an employee of Global as well.

02:17:48.974 --> 02:17:53.779
If the board that appoints him, that person can be removed by Global.

02:17:54.360 --> 02:17:54.600
Yeah.

02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:55.000
Okay.

02:17:55.040 --> 02:17:55.381
I got it.

02:17:55.401 --> 02:17:55.961
All right.

02:17:56.101 --> 02:17:56.642
I understand.

02:17:56.662 --> 02:17:57.202
Who's next?

02:17:57.242 --> 02:17:57.583
Yeah.

02:17:58.844 --> 02:17:59.785
Board Member Williams.

02:17:59.805 --> 02:18:06.131
Did you hear that?

02:18:06.151 --> 02:18:06.191
No.

02:18:07.574 --> 02:18:15.719
So, I think one of the things that I, I know that this, I have been told that the structures are legal.

02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:19.501
But, and I'm sure they were set up by lawyers.

02:18:20.262 --> 02:18:37.072
But, but one of the things I'm not familiar with, and I don't know how common it is, I think it's not common, is to have, is to have

02:18:38.946 --> 02:18:59.614
the global, a group that provides services, that gets paid by the school to provide a variety of services, to have them have a sole statutory member that then approves or removes board members of the school.

02:19:00.574 --> 02:19:02.875
It feels like it's kind of upside down to me.

02:19:03.835 --> 02:19:13.002
you know, in terms of the vendor having that instead of the board and CEO of the schools.

02:19:14.022 --> 02:19:17.645
Does it, what would your comment be on that?

02:19:17.765 --> 02:19:26.932
Yes, it certainly raises a concern for us now as it did when the last two celerity charters

02:19:27.552 --> 02:19:30.434
came before us or came before the board.

02:19:30.454 --> 02:19:46.965
Certainly, we feel there is the potential for a conflict there, which, you know, which drove us or led us to initially impose the condition that, you know, that

02:19:47.725 --> 02:20:04.270
both CEG and Global opened their books and opened their operations to us to, you know, if we feel like there is something going on there that needs to be investigated.

02:20:05.791 --> 02:20:31.489
I think now that today, you know, given some of the things that have been in the press and this investigation, you know, while we, you know, cannot point to anything specific as to, you know, something inappropriate going on, you know, we feel like, you know, yeah, we, now is the time we need to, you know,

02:20:32.481 --> 02:20:37.083
to, you know, have full comfort and confidence in this operation.

02:20:37.123 --> 02:20:44.187
We feel like, you know, this needs to look, be looked into further by independent agency.

02:20:45.047 --> 02:20:48.229
That's what has led to the additional condition.

02:20:48.669 --> 02:20:48.969
Okay.

02:20:49.069 --> 02:20:54.372
And just to wrap up, wrap up my question or comment, I, as far as I know, nothing has been found.

02:20:55.212 --> 02:20:56.873
There's no findings issued, right?

02:20:57.133 --> 02:20:58.194
And I think it's important.

02:21:00.215 --> 02:21:00.435
Right.

02:21:02.196 --> 02:21:03.477
or the federal investigation.

02:21:03.597 --> 02:21:03.897
Yes.

02:21:05.137 --> 02:21:07.859
But nothing has been found or released as a finding.

02:21:09.139 --> 02:21:15.442
We just have a structure and an investigation that makes us feel very cautious.

02:21:15.782 --> 02:21:16.022
Yes.

02:21:16.182 --> 02:21:17.203
About the potential here.

02:21:17.483 --> 02:21:17.723
Yes.

02:21:18.543 --> 02:21:18.763
Okay.

02:21:18.803 --> 02:21:22.865
I'm going to call on a board member Valdez and then I think we need to move to public hearing.

02:21:22.925 --> 02:21:24.746
It might illuminate some of these issues.

02:21:25.601 --> 02:21:26.602
Mine's a technical question.

02:21:26.622 --> 02:21:33.445
You answered part of it because you talked about a conflict of interest between global and global and the goods and services and the other part.

02:21:33.865 --> 02:21:39.828
But the other piece is we're approving this today because of statutory timelines or making a decision of determination.

02:21:39.868 --> 02:21:40.488
Is that correct?

02:21:40.808 --> 02:21:48.172
Even though this investigation seems to be fluid and you do have concerns, but we're... Is that why we're doing this today?

02:21:50.093 --> 02:21:51.513
Because of the statutory timelines?

02:21:51.553 --> 02:21:51.773
Yes.

02:21:52.334 --> 02:21:52.494
Yes.

02:21:53.795 --> 02:22:05.022
Okay, so I'm going to now open the public hearing and each side will have 10 minutes and we'll have first the petitioner for the charter school.

02:22:38.965 --> 02:22:40.226
Good morning.

02:22:40.626 --> 02:22:47.930
My name is Grace Canada, and I have the honor and pleasure of serving as the CEO for Solarity Educational Group.

02:22:49.091 --> 02:22:49.551
And good morning.

02:22:49.591 --> 02:22:50.671
My name is Nadia Shaik.

02:22:50.871 --> 02:22:53.833
I am director of school services for Solarity Educational Group.

02:22:56.064 --> 02:23:07.274
As you'll hear from Nadia in a few minutes, we operate in some of the toughest neighborhoods, neighborhoods where others fail, and yet we consistently succeed.

02:23:09.213 --> 02:23:21.698
Our schools outperform LAUSD, the county, and state averages in English language arts and math on the 2016 CASP assessment.

02:23:22.739 --> 02:23:31.022
And our students love to come to school, as evidenced by an astounding 97.31% in-seat attendance rate.

02:23:32.602 --> 02:23:34.363
Dyett and Troika are no different.

02:23:35.244 --> 02:23:38.525
Both schools have equally amazing results.

02:23:40.842 --> 02:23:51.549
As you know, the ACCS conditioned their positive recommendation on CEG answering all of the staff's questions, remaining questions.

02:23:52.490 --> 02:23:55.232
We did so, and we did so thoroughly.

02:23:55.252 --> 02:23:59.014
And we are proud to have received their recommendation today.

02:24:00.095 --> 02:24:09.741
And I really want to acknowledge and acknowledge staff's time and say thank you for the opportunity to collaborate.

02:24:10.962 --> 02:24:15.804
We stand here ready and excited to accept the conditions recommended by staff.

02:24:16.665 --> 02:24:19.886
As we've said all along, it's all about the students.

02:24:21.327 --> 02:24:27.630
Our goal is to continue to provide the highest quality education to our stakeholder communities.

02:24:31.690 --> 02:24:37.532
I've been a part of Celerity since 2005 as founding principal of Celerity Nascent Charter School.

02:24:38.593 --> 02:24:40.153
Next to me stands Nadia Shaik.

02:24:41.174 --> 02:24:48.036
She joined us in 2000, Director of School Services, and she joined us in 2006 as a first grade teacher.

02:24:50.597 --> 02:24:55.119
One of the biggest honors I have is working with our amazing board.

02:24:56.319 --> 02:25:02.041
Kurt Hessler has a stellar resume of public service and private industry experience.

02:25:02.922 --> 02:25:08.464
He's worked for the President, the Supreme Court, and a laundry list of successful businesses.

02:25:09.424 --> 02:25:15.807
And I am excited that you will have a chance to hear from him yourself today.

02:25:16.987 --> 02:25:23.090
With Kurt are four members of the community who devote countless hours to make a meaningful difference.

02:25:25.020 --> 02:25:30.362
Ron, too, is also here today, and you will have an opportunity to hear from him during public comment.

02:25:32.963 --> 02:25:38.085
A question I often get is, how does Solarity Global support the schools?

02:25:40.100 --> 02:25:40.920
Let me count the ways.

02:25:42.140 --> 02:26:03.465
A robust performing arts program, curriculum development, special education, human resources, leadership coaching, accounting, facilities, public relations, grants, replication, data management, financial management,

02:26:04.205 --> 02:26:13.912
board support, training, insurance, procurement, technology, financial reporting, recruiting, and more.

02:26:16.574 --> 02:26:24.720
Global assists with all that so that we can focus on delivering a top-notch education that each Celerity student deserves, day in and day out.

02:26:26.181 --> 02:26:30.644
I'm proud to share with you a little bit about Celerity Dyad, a school I taught and worked at.

02:26:31.761 --> 02:26:35.325
Almost all of Dyad's students are socioeconomically disadvantaged, fully 90%.

02:26:37.187 --> 02:26:45.636
Solarity's educational program is designed to meet the needs of these students, Latino, at risk, and who have had a consistent lack of educational choices.

02:26:46.829 --> 02:26:53.012
Our students face enormous hurdles to academic and life success simply because of where they live, South Los Angeles.

02:26:53.652 --> 02:26:58.735
For example, they're surrounded by high unemployment, low incomes, and high crime rates.

02:26:59.695 --> 02:27:04.538
And all of the schools that Celerity Dyad would otherwise attend are currently in program improvement.

02:27:05.818 --> 02:27:09.021
The other schools have simply not been able to overcome these high hurdles.

02:27:09.501 --> 02:27:12.564
They consistently do far worse than LAUSD as a whole.

02:27:13.725 --> 02:27:17.668
We have had great success in closing the achievement gap over the past nine years.

02:27:19.009 --> 02:27:28.997
Under the law, increases in academic achievement at a charter school shall be the most important factor in a charter renewal and Celerity Dyad has been closing that achievement gap in South LA.

02:27:29.998 --> 02:27:41.223
Despite the very real disadvantages and hurdles that Dyad students face daily, they consistently outperform their resident, their district, their county, and even state averages, and they continue to improve.

02:27:43.184 --> 02:27:45.445
This is Dyad in orange in the orange bar.

02:27:46.431 --> 02:27:54.615
We are outperforming everyone on the charts, the state, county, LAUSD as a whole, and in particular, the schools that our students would otherwise attend.

02:27:55.735 --> 02:28:02.118
Just look at the gap between Dyad's Orange Bar and the median of the local schools around us, the bar to the right.

02:28:04.540 --> 02:28:06.901
And this isn't just school wide, it's by student group.

02:28:07.541 --> 02:28:18.303
For instance, in the most recent CASP assessment in 2016, 33% of dyads English learners met or exceeded standards in English language arts compared to 3% at LAUSD.

02:28:19.444 --> 02:28:24.145
For math, 36% of our English learners met or exceed standards compared to 6% at LAUSD.

02:28:29.696 --> 02:28:33.939
Simply put, celerity dyad is the best result for the students who attend our charter school.

02:28:34.760 --> 02:28:42.065
If the charter for celerity dyad is not renewed, our students will attend schools that perform significantly worse on standardized tests.

02:28:43.186 --> 02:28:44.387
And it isn't just test scores.

02:28:45.068 --> 02:28:49.831
Dyad's suspension rate has steadily declined each year over the past three years.

02:28:50.672 --> 02:28:54.414
And dyad has increased its reclassification rate of English learners between 2015 and 2016.

02:28:56.796 --> 02:29:06.041
In our most recent parent survey, fully 100% of Dyett's parents believe that our school provides them the resources to support their child beyond the regular school day.

02:29:07.281 --> 02:29:17.166
I want to take a second and thank and acknowledge the parents, students, former students, staff, and supporters who have come here today from Los Angeles.

02:29:17.566 --> 02:29:17.946
Thank you.

02:29:18.187 --> 02:29:19.487
Many of them you'll hear from today.

02:29:20.948 --> 02:29:25.110
Thank you for your time and consideration of just how great a school Dyett is.

02:29:30.387 --> 02:29:30.848
Good morning.

02:29:32.610 --> 02:29:34.011
My name is Maurice Tsa.

02:29:34.112 --> 02:29:34.953
I'm with Gibson Dunn.

02:29:35.213 --> 02:29:37.255
I am counsel to Solarity.

02:29:37.916 --> 02:29:41.781
For ease, I'm going to call CEG Solarity, and I'm going to refer to global as global.

02:29:43.503 --> 02:29:47.247
I am here to assure you of two things.

02:29:48.410 --> 02:30:10.618
The first thing is, after a thorough review of the documents, the board meeting minutes, interviews of management, and a deep examination of Solarity's operations, that the governance structure and the governance of Solarity is, frankly, has no par.

02:30:12.715 --> 02:30:16.722
I would like to address right now an issue that came up in this last discussion.

02:30:17.343 --> 02:30:22.011
First of all, with respect to Global, Global has never removed a board member.

02:30:22.511 --> 02:30:22.652
Ever.

02:30:23.410 --> 02:30:25.671
We have turned over all of the board meeting minutes.

02:30:26.031 --> 02:30:35.297
If you review them, you will see that no one from Global has interjected themselves in the decision making of the board of Celerity.

02:30:35.897 --> 02:30:50.365
And Celerity has consistently worked through its board to make the right decisions for the school, which has been demonstrated by the fact that the school has outperformed all of its competitor schools.

02:30:51.750 --> 02:31:06.474
Second, as Celerity has always done, we are looking forward and moving forward by continuing to refine governance structures in order to ensure that Celerity becomes a model for governance for all charter schools.

02:31:07.334 --> 02:31:14.676
So what I'm going to describe now is exactly what is happening and what has been done since this very last ACCS hearing.

02:31:18.337 --> 02:31:19.118
The first thing is

02:31:20.663 --> 02:31:25.405
The board has met and has passed a number of resolutions, which I'm going to describe to you now.

02:31:26.646 --> 02:31:30.128
It is no mystery that there have been questions raised about global.

02:31:30.788 --> 02:31:32.148
We expect to hear more of them today.

02:31:32.429 --> 02:31:33.129
We welcome them.

02:31:33.689 --> 02:31:42.213
Frankly, we feel the questions about global are entirely appropriate, and we have strong answers for all of the questions that you may have.

02:31:42.774 --> 02:31:43.494
But let me say this.

02:31:46.078 --> 02:31:56.142
All the services that Global provided, a suite, were particularly important as Solarity began to develop its operations and grow through what is now seven schools.

02:31:57.182 --> 02:32:05.365
However, as Solarity has matured over time, it has become clear that there are many opportunities to review that relationship.

02:32:05.726 --> 02:32:08.186
And that is exactly what Board Resolution No.

02:32:08.206 --> 02:32:08.567
1 does.

02:32:09.447 --> 02:32:14.549
The Board has directed CEG management to analyze corporate formation and structure,

02:32:15.289 --> 02:32:20.213
and the contractual relationship between CEG and Global, including possible termination.

02:32:20.933 --> 02:32:31.320
And again, let me emphasize, this has been completely public and well discussed within Celerity and within Global, and Global has been behind this effort 100%.

02:32:33.803 --> 02:32:46.227
The fundamental goal of what we are here to tell you today is that more than anything, all of the stakeholders in Solarity and Global want to keep the seven schools open.

02:32:47.508 --> 02:32:51.509
That is the fundamental point for board resolution number one.

02:32:53.250 --> 02:32:53.790
Time is up.

02:32:55.290 --> 02:32:55.791
Ten minutes.

02:32:56.611 --> 02:32:59.792
So now we'll hear from the people that oppose the petition.

02:33:14.861 --> 02:33:20.106
Good morning, Board President Kirst and Deputy Superintendent Price, board members.

02:33:20.186 --> 02:33:23.448
I'm Robert Perry, Los Angeles Unified School District.

02:33:23.849 --> 02:33:27.112
I come representing Superintendent King and the board.

02:33:27.532 --> 02:33:34.418
I have with me today from our fiscal team, Amy Long, and from our Office of the General Counsel, Devorah Navarro-Reed.

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:38.301
I've come to speak to you today

02:33:39.460 --> 02:33:50.085
to appeal to this body to uphold the unanimous decision unanimous decision of the LAUSD board to deny the two charter petitions before you today.

02:33:51.586 --> 02:33:57.129
Our team has been involved in the oversight of the schools in this group of charters for over a decade.

02:33:58.310 --> 02:34:00.991
While we acknowledge the achievement of students

02:34:03.160 --> 02:34:13.603
that attend the schools, our findings delineate the serious concerns that are borne by the decisions made by the school's leadership and governing board.

02:34:14.863 --> 02:34:29.648
Our concerns align with those noted in the CDE's report today, where they said, due to the recent public allegations, ongoing multi-agency federal investigation

02:34:33.453 --> 02:34:45.301
And additional information provided by CEG of the numerous related party contracts and transactions entered into by Solarity Education Group, Solarity Global Development and their affiliates.

02:34:45.401 --> 02:34:52.786
The CDE notes concerns on how this may affect the ability of the petitioner to successfully implement the program.

02:34:53.687 --> 02:34:54.908
Those were our concerns.

02:34:55.588 --> 02:34:57.389
Those were our concerns in November.

02:34:58.070 --> 02:34:59.731
Those are our concerns today.

02:35:02.668 --> 02:35:23.167
At its November meeting, this board approved two new schools for this organization after being presented with specific concerns that the CDE had regarding, and I quote again from the documents you have before you from the CDE today, they had concerns on the governance structure of CEG and its affiliates.

02:35:24.288 --> 02:35:27.331
The board, this board approved the schools with a condition.

02:35:28.894 --> 02:35:34.855
that the organization would fully cooperate with any investigation into their operations.

02:35:36.075 --> 02:35:37.936
It's a condition that's given today.

02:35:37.956 --> 02:35:39.416
It was a condition in November.

02:35:39.956 --> 02:35:51.738
After that meeting, we set up a meeting with CEG's leadership to seek the same level of transparency and cooperation that had been committed to this board.

02:35:53.818 --> 02:35:55.059
We met on November 10th, 2016.

02:35:58.234 --> 02:36:17.702
As a starting point, CEG was asked to provide finally a complete, transparent, as promised, total governance structure, affiliated entity structure, and we got it in a timely fashion on December 15th.

02:36:19.574 --> 02:36:36.406
only to find out this past week in reviewing CDE's public and published report for this agenda, we discovered entities that we did not, were not given on the transparent document.

02:36:37.507 --> 02:36:40.009
There is, you've talked about global.

02:36:40.509 --> 02:36:42.070
Global is not the only entity.

02:36:42.691 --> 02:36:44.952
There's celerity development, LLC.

02:36:45.373 --> 02:36:46.333
There's Attencher.

02:36:47.134 --> 02:36:48.315
There's Orion Schools.

02:36:49.844 --> 02:36:53.805
All of those provide services to CEG.

02:36:54.865 --> 02:37:09.288
On attention, we found out from the CDE's document that, first of all, that attention was a for-profit entity and we didn't, weren't aware of that at that time or at least it wasn't on this document.

02:37:10.048 --> 02:37:19.390
Additionally, we learned that there were entities such as the Roan Group and Student Learning Pathways that were not on this chart.

02:37:20.987 --> 02:37:22.247
this transparent chart.

02:37:24.288 --> 02:37:27.988
The chart shows that Orion Schools operates a private school.

02:37:28.489 --> 02:37:32.749
This chart says it's in Pasadena when in fact it's 30 miles away in Chino Hills.

02:37:34.010 --> 02:37:38.050
The transparent chart according to the conditions.

02:37:40.411 --> 02:37:45.952
Our question for this board is when will we ever get to the truth about the interconnectivity?

02:37:47.832 --> 02:37:50.053
We've had promise after promise after promise.

02:37:51.607 --> 02:37:52.487
We're not there.

02:37:56.589 --> 02:37:58.270
We talk about Solarity Global.

02:37:58.931 --> 02:38:05.474
We know that $2.2 million approximately was transferred from CEG into Global.

02:38:09.055 --> 02:38:11.096
That can happen with the sole statutory.

02:38:11.136 --> 02:38:12.997
That wasn't talked about a few moments ago.

02:38:15.138 --> 02:38:20.801
Part of our job as overseers of the public trust is to monitor public funds

02:38:22.586 --> 02:38:27.989
watch where they go, hold the entities accountable for them.

02:38:28.889 --> 02:38:35.133
If the State Board continues to approve organizations with such complex and intricate structures,

02:38:36.135 --> 02:38:41.960
In a de facto way, it's making it a tacit approval of those.

02:38:42.261 --> 02:38:47.525
And it makes us on the ground have an even more difficult job to oversee.

02:38:47.946 --> 02:38:51.209
Because we believe you can't oversee what you can't see.

02:38:51.949 --> 02:38:54.492
And I'll turn the rest of my time over to Ms.

02:38:54.552 --> 02:38:56.113
Long and Ms.

02:38:56.153 --> 02:38:56.734
Navarro-Reed.

02:38:59.364 --> 02:38:59.824
Good morning.

02:38:59.844 --> 02:39:14.030
I was going to share with you what I shared before the State's Advisory Commission on Charter Schools, but I really wanted to address some of the questions that I heard earlier from the board, which is with regards to the governance and the structure of it.

02:39:15.230 --> 02:39:16.031
So, as Ms.

02:39:16.191 --> 02:39:23.754
Sing Chan said earlier about the boxes, right, with the charter school and with there being CEG and above it being something global,

02:39:24.494 --> 02:39:40.809
I just want to let you know that if you were to go to the California Secretary of State website and you look up these Solarity entities, you will find that for Solarity Global Development, which acts in the capacity of a sole statutory member and a vendor of Solarity Educational Group,

02:39:41.650 --> 02:39:46.113
lists Bianca McFarlane as the CEO of Solarity Global.

02:39:46.693 --> 02:39:47.254
Now, Ms.

02:39:47.294 --> 02:39:51.496
McFarlane is also the former CEO of Solarity Educational Group.

02:39:52.477 --> 02:39:56.560
We have also been informed that, by CEG, that Ms.

02:39:56.580 --> 02:39:59.802
McFarlane is also a board member of Solarity Global Development.

02:40:00.302 --> 02:40:02.945
Okay, so that's the sole statutory member and the vendor.

02:40:02.965 --> 02:40:15.159
Now if you look at the other Solarity entities, if you look up their information on the California Secretary of State website, Solarity Development LLC has one member, Ms.

02:40:15.179 --> 02:40:15.759
McFarland.

02:40:15.860 --> 02:40:16.801
She is the CEO.

02:40:17.682 --> 02:40:20.084
Solarity Development LLC does business with CEG.

02:40:21.195 --> 02:40:24.538
Solarity Contracting Services also discloses Ms.

02:40:24.558 --> 02:40:25.939
McFarland as the CEO.

02:40:27.360 --> 02:40:30.062
Solarity Contracting Service also does business with CEG.

02:40:31.122 --> 02:40:33.704
A Tenture LLC also discloses Ms.

02:40:33.724 --> 02:40:36.126
McFarland as the CEO of that entity.

02:40:36.666 --> 02:40:39.288
They also do business with Solarity Educational Group.

02:40:40.209 --> 02:40:46.574
So I want to apprise the board of this information, which is public information, so that you have everything you need to make the decision today.

02:40:50.552 --> 02:40:50.892
Thank you.

02:40:50.933 --> 02:40:52.014
Good morning, board members.

02:40:52.454 --> 02:40:53.896
My name is Devorah Navarro-Reed.

02:40:53.916 --> 02:40:57.720
I'm Chief Education Legal Counsel for LA Unified School District.

02:40:58.581 --> 02:41:04.448
CDE and the State Board already has our findings of fact related to these two celerity schools.

02:41:04.948 --> 02:41:08.492
I would just like to take an opportunity to highlight some of the critical findings.

02:41:09.173 --> 02:41:26.333
In 2012, Solarity Educational Group created unilaterally, without the approval of LAUSD's Board of Education, Solarity Global Development, which has already been ad nauseum said is the sole statutory member of Solarity Educational Group.

02:41:28.286 --> 02:41:32.208
As a sole statutory member, it affords global the following rights.

02:41:32.768 --> 02:41:43.392
The power to elect and remove CEG's board members, dispose of CEG's assets, merge CEG with other corporations, or the power to dissolve the corporation.

02:41:44.192 --> 02:41:54.636
Even though it's been represented that CEG has, Solarity Global has never done that, or is not going to do that, those are their rights under the California Corporations Code under Section 5056.

02:41:56.517 --> 02:42:00.518
So regardless of what the representations are, those are their corporate rights.

02:42:01.518 --> 02:42:17.823
In addition, CEG entered into an affiliation management agreement with Global, delegating day-to-day management of CEG schools to Global, which calls into the question what the board has been discussing this morning regarding local control.

02:42:19.850 --> 02:42:23.394
CEG also transferred $2.3 million to Global.

02:42:24.094 --> 02:42:28.879
To date, there are no answers regarding the rationale for those transfers.

02:42:29.460 --> 02:42:34.906
There were also checks to Global for the amount of $5 million and $5,021,000 to the LLC for $334,000

02:42:41.352 --> 02:42:47.955
and to Celerity Contracting for $321,943 back in 2016.

02:42:48.456 --> 02:42:55.179
As part of oversight, the Charter Schools Division requested information regarding those amounts and rationale and none was provided.

02:42:57.500 --> 02:43:04.824
We are requesting the State Board to uphold our findings, the LAUSD's findings regarding these two schools.

02:43:05.540 --> 02:43:17.746
There's no standard anywhere in the Charter Schools Act indicating that fraud needs to be substantiated in order to find, make a finding of non-renewal.

02:43:18.787 --> 02:43:20.488
I would also like to take a moment.

02:43:20.948 --> 02:43:21.268
Time.

02:43:21.768 --> 02:43:22.188
Thank you.

02:43:22.328 --> 02:43:22.749
Thank you.

02:43:24.309 --> 02:43:24.670
Okay.

02:43:24.730 --> 02:43:27.091
We'll now have the public comment.

02:43:30.032 --> 02:43:31.993
Oh, usually we proceed to public.

02:43:34.567 --> 02:43:36.529
I would prefer to wait till after public comment.

02:43:37.430 --> 02:43:38.751
Okay, public comment.

02:43:40.313 --> 02:43:40.633
Pardon?

02:43:41.053 --> 02:43:41.654
Close the hearing.

02:43:41.994 --> 02:43:42.815
Hearing is closed.

02:43:46.218 --> 02:43:48.120
Would the following people please line up?

02:43:48.941 --> 02:43:56.868
Tanya Elizabeth Duke, Hilda Torres, Patrick Strickley, Guillermo Hernandez, Kurt Hessler, Ron Ben,

02:43:59.710 --> 02:44:25.162
Yehuda, Marbella Gill, Lubia Elizabeth Duke, Vania Garcia, Jeanette Davila, Rocio Perez, Ladi Omarez, Erica Ramos, Iman Khalil, Yuri Ria de Jesus Ramirez, Paula Carcamo, Karina Acosta, Carla

02:44:26.519 --> 02:44:32.919
Labradores De Ruiz, Michelle Lynch, Ken Burt, Eric Primack, and Lorraine Richards.

02:44:42.125 --> 02:44:43.906
Hello I'm Tanya Duque.

02:44:44.086 --> 02:44:47.747
I am currently an 8th grader at Solarity Dia Charter School.

02:44:48.388 --> 02:44:49.948
My time there has been amazing.

02:44:50.288 --> 02:44:54.490
The dance shows that we participate in are fun and they teach us students how to work with others.

02:44:55.310 --> 02:45:00.012
They help us gain confidence because we perform in front of many parents.

02:45:00.512 --> 02:45:02.153
The teachers are also very helpful.

02:45:02.573 --> 02:45:04.214
If you have a question you can go to them.

02:45:04.594 --> 02:45:06.635
They motivate us to do the best we can be.

02:45:07.235 --> 02:45:11.517
All in all this is a really great school and I hope you allow it to stay just as it is.

02:45:24.861 --> 02:45:25.642
Hi, good morning.

02:45:25.742 --> 02:45:27.043
My name is Hilda Torres.

02:45:27.283 --> 02:45:34.749
As a single mother of a student attending Salary Diet, I am pleased with my decision to choose a school that fits best for my family.

02:45:35.369 --> 02:45:37.871
I am a firm believer in public charter schools.

02:45:37.992 --> 02:45:41.534
My son is an energetic fourth grader who is very smart, friendly, and outgoing.

02:45:42.055 --> 02:45:44.797
He has earned honor roll on a yearly basis.

02:45:44.917 --> 02:45:48.860
My son loves the school, his teachers, and looks forward to going every day.

02:45:49.881 --> 02:45:55.307
It's a hard fact that public charter schools are a lifeline for dozens of Southern California families, including mine.

02:45:55.908 --> 02:46:03.096
Before charter schools arrived, if your child was sworn for a charter school and you couldn't afford private school or to move, you were trapped.

02:46:03.697 --> 02:46:04.237
Thankfully,

02:46:04.798 --> 02:46:13.628
Charter schools such as celery diet were introduced as laboratories of motivation and parent conversation, collaboration.

02:46:14.289 --> 02:46:21.177
Our school is making a positive impact in our community and I wouldn't like my kid to go to a low-performing school.

02:46:22.138 --> 02:46:22.459
Thank you.

02:46:27.179 --> 02:46:27.679
Good morning.

02:46:27.939 --> 02:46:33.021
My name is Patrick Stickley and I'm the principal of Celerity Dyad Charter School in South Los Angeles.

02:46:33.681 --> 02:46:37.222
Our area is viewed throughout the world as a rough and tumble neighborhood.

02:46:37.682 --> 02:46:40.763
Gangs and homelessness abounds, yet Dyad thrives.

02:46:41.583 --> 02:46:48.265
This is proof that the residents of this neighborhood understand that education is the bridge to a productive life.

02:46:49.205 --> 02:46:55.670
In partnership with our parents, Dyad is that bridge that their children cross daily to close the achievement gap.

02:46:56.310 --> 02:47:04.997
In addition to the packets of letters of support that I brought, I would like to share a letter of support that our area school resources police officer wrote for us.

02:47:05.137 --> 02:47:15.505
He states, of the 63 other schools in my patrol area that I work with, Celerity Dyad is the only one that consistently goes out of its way to maintain a good and informative relationship

02:47:16.125 --> 02:47:20.927
with parents while also seeing that its students are educated and well-rounded in every way.

02:47:20.967 --> 02:47:23.228
It's the kind of place that I would send my own child.

02:47:23.428 --> 02:47:26.169
I can assure you that this is a school that needs to stay.

02:47:26.750 --> 02:47:31.512
I feel that the community would suffer greatly if this school was no longer allowed to function.

02:47:31.832 --> 02:47:36.133
In conclusion, you have the power to partner up with Solarity Dyad.

02:47:36.214 --> 02:47:36.534
Time.

02:47:36.594 --> 02:47:41.516
Continue to let Dyad Bridge be the bridge that our students use to close the achievement gap.

02:47:41.716 --> 02:47:41.996
Thank you.

02:47:50.353 --> 02:47:54.814
Hello, my name is Guillermo Hernandez and I'm a product from Solarity NASID.

02:47:55.715 --> 02:48:05.077
I'm currently attending Northeastern University in Boston as a fourth year studying electrical engineering as a Gates Millennium Scholar.

02:48:05.697 --> 02:48:10.419
At Solarity, it wasn't just about the education, it was more about the support system.

02:48:12.079 --> 02:48:15.121
I remember Celery as a community of teachers that cared about me.

02:48:15.341 --> 02:48:18.643
Before Celery, I attended a public school where it was easy to blend in.

02:48:18.763 --> 02:48:22.785
Teachers never expressed an interest in challenging me past the curriculum.

02:48:23.605 --> 02:48:24.626
At Celery, it was different.

02:48:24.766 --> 02:48:29.249
I noticed students wanting to spend their lunchtime with their favorite teacher.

02:48:29.589 --> 02:48:30.349
That was foreign to me.

02:48:30.389 --> 02:48:36.433
I remember Mr. Graham, my math teacher from seventh grade, told me to come by during lunch to recognize my achievement and encourage me.

02:48:37.533 --> 02:48:39.595
Encourage my leadership potential with my peers.

02:48:39.995 --> 02:48:42.578
I said it again with my A4A teacher, Mr. Watsman.

02:48:43.458 --> 02:48:46.821
In the classes I did struggle, my teachers took the extra step to help me.

02:48:47.602 --> 02:48:49.664
When I think about celerity, I remember my teachers.

02:48:49.944 --> 02:48:52.646
I'd like to thank them for showing me the definition of what a teacher is.

02:48:53.787 --> 02:49:03.115
Today, I'm asking you to keep the celerity diet open for the generations after me so that they can learn in a place that both challenges and cares for them.

02:49:03.295 --> 02:49:03.576
Thank you.

02:49:09.958 --> 02:49:11.000
Hi, I'm Kurt Hessler.

02:49:11.060 --> 02:49:13.783
I'm the president of the board of CEG.

02:49:13.803 --> 02:49:15.726
I've been on the board for 11 years.

02:49:15.766 --> 02:49:19.010
We have five members, obviously all unpaid professionals.

02:49:20.067 --> 02:49:21.108
members of the community.

02:49:21.808 --> 02:49:30.774
One of them, Dana Walden, has been out 11 years, as I have, and is really responsible for the Performing Arts Education Program and the whole thing.

02:49:30.834 --> 02:49:35.897
Julie Stern was the Chief Operating Officer of Oprah Winfrey's movie and TV production company.

02:49:35.937 --> 02:49:36.717
It's one of the biggest.

02:49:36.877 --> 02:49:38.418
She's been there for eight years.

02:49:38.438 --> 02:49:45.863
You'll see Ron Ben-Yehuda, who's one of the best intellectual property lawyers in California, partner in a major firm.

02:49:46.683 --> 02:49:47.784
And Francisco

02:49:48.314 --> 02:49:52.716
Morris, who is a senior HR executive at the Screen Actors Guild.

02:49:53.177 --> 02:49:53.997
That's the board.

02:49:54.017 --> 02:49:55.538
We're totally independent.

02:49:55.578 --> 02:49:59.900
Global has never said a word to us, and we wouldn't listen anyway if they did.

02:50:01.441 --> 02:50:04.403
We're the boss of the management of CEG.

02:50:04.483 --> 02:50:09.446
The management, you saw those two women who stood up, are just unbelievably amazing.

02:50:09.486 --> 02:50:10.907
They've been there from the beginning.

02:50:11.947 --> 02:50:17.030
When I joined in the CEG, there was no Global, and it really doesn't matter.

02:50:17.523 --> 02:50:20.584
We're happy to meet all of the conditions that were imposed on us.

02:50:27.847 --> 02:50:28.327
Good morning.

02:50:28.647 --> 02:50:29.847
My name is Ron Ben Yehuda.

02:50:29.967 --> 02:50:34.909
I'm one of CEG's board members and I'm also the chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee of the board.

02:50:35.697 --> 02:50:40.421
Like the other board members, I am and have always been a volunteer board member.

02:50:40.902 --> 02:50:50.831
I currently practice at Paul Hastings, and a large part of my practice is advising companies, including startups, established mid-market firms, and Fortune 100 companies.

02:50:51.332 --> 02:50:55.075
I've also served as a general counsel of two different software companies.

02:50:55.936 --> 02:51:14.236
I joined CEG's board about two years ago because I was inspired by the enthusiasm that I saw from everyone I met about educating children, and I was also incredibly impressed by the spectacular success that CEG has shown, providing incredible opportunities to children that lack options.

02:51:16.036 --> 02:51:22.338
If I didn't believe in Solarity's mission to bring great education to, you know, needy communities, I wouldn't be here.

02:51:22.358 --> 02:51:23.579
I wouldn't be on the board.

02:51:25.099 --> 02:51:27.080
And doing that is something we're really succeeding at.

02:51:27.620 --> 02:51:29.861
As you know, our schools, including Dyad and Troika.

02:51:30.361 --> 02:51:30.961
Time.

02:51:31.862 --> 02:51:32.462
Thank you very much.

02:51:41.032 --> 02:51:41.432
Good morning.

02:51:41.773 --> 02:51:42.833
My name is Marbea Gill.

02:51:43.294 --> 02:51:50.119
Over the past five years at Solarity, I've experienced a charter school that sets the bar high for their staff and students.

02:51:50.900 --> 02:51:54.662
I chose to teach at Solarity Dyad because of all the positive things I had heard.

02:51:55.203 --> 02:52:00.087
The management and the operations are excellent and the teachers are highly trained and committed to their students.

02:52:00.627 --> 02:52:05.471
We work hard to provide an exceptional and rigorous education to the children of the South LA neighborhood.

02:52:05.971 --> 02:52:08.173
The proof can be seen in the students' achievement.

02:52:08.673 --> 02:52:17.621
Our parents support us and value being able to send their children to an accomplished school and the families in the community should have the opportunity to provide their children with a good education.

02:52:18.241 --> 02:52:21.984
I also truly appreciate and enjoy being part of this school.

02:52:22.545 --> 02:52:27.569
From our engaging lessons to the beautiful performing arts shows, we are a great school to attend.

02:52:28.349 --> 02:52:33.814
Our 690 students deserve to continue receiving a high quality education at Dyett.

02:52:34.194 --> 02:52:35.275
Thank you for your consideration.

02:52:45.127 --> 02:52:46.848
I'm just going to translate what she says.

02:52:46.868 --> 02:53:01.118
She says her name is Luvia and she's the daughter of a student who has been able to excel since the first grade to eighth grade and she has been in honor roll.

02:53:16.298 --> 02:53:16.398
uh

02:53:38.751 --> 02:53:49.226
She says that her daughter has even had the president send her a certificate and that means that the school must be doing good all thanks to the

02:53:50.498 --> 02:54:00.344
the to the teachers and the principal and she has come in representation of the fathers and mothers who haven't been able to come assist and present.

02:54:15.514 --> 02:54:26.958
She knows that this is the last year of her daughter at this school, but she's going to keep supporting the school because of the students that they're still teaching.

02:54:26.978 --> 02:54:36.782
Ellos son los que necesitan a su escuela y maestros que han dado la enseñanza y el apoyo de estudiar.

02:54:36.942 --> 02:54:41.964
Ellos están creciendo con la misma escuela y la escuela podría

02:54:46.285 --> 02:54:50.326
Si la escuela cierra, la escuela podría... Time.

02:54:52.346 --> 02:54:55.387
El futuro de... Yeah, you can finish that translation.

02:54:55.447 --> 02:54:56.067
Go ahead, translate.

02:54:56.127 --> 02:55:04.448
Okay, so the students are the ones who need the schools because they are growing and with the same school.

02:55:04.568 --> 02:55:11.330
And if you close the school, they could change their future that they have planned along with their teachers.

02:55:11.810 --> 02:55:12.190
Thank you.

02:55:12.410 --> 02:55:12.930
Thank you.

02:55:20.882 --> 02:55:21.903
Hello, my name is Vanya.

02:55:22.043 --> 02:55:30.549
I was a previous alumni here at Dyad, and coming to this school empowered me to achieve and excel beyond my limits.

02:55:31.689 --> 02:55:36.393
The way the teachers taught allowed me to develop a growth mindset rather than a fixed mindset.

02:55:38.234 --> 02:55:45.719
Each teacher worked with the students' needs one-on-one, which really allowed the students to progress with everyone at the same time.

02:55:47.714 --> 02:55:53.299
Around a year ago, my previous high school was shut down almost overnight.

02:55:54.500 --> 02:55:58.704
And going to another school for the last year of high school was very troublesome.

02:55:58.944 --> 02:56:03.188
I had to reestablish my college plan because I was at a new school.

02:56:04.870 --> 02:56:08.213
And coming closer to the end of the year, I was

02:56:09.901 --> 02:56:14.643
I have progressed and I am in my new school and controlled my situation as best as I could.

02:56:15.143 --> 02:56:24.026
It was a result of this school that I was accepted into Humboldt State University this up and coming fall.

02:56:25.347 --> 02:56:35.350
It was because of schools like these that allowed me to become first generation college student for my family.

02:56:38.248 --> 02:56:42.313
I am who I am due to the foundation that I was exposed to here at Dyett.

02:56:42.393 --> 02:56:47.078
And I would really love it if they could continue on for generations after myself.

02:56:47.178 --> 02:56:48.460
And I really do love that.

02:56:48.840 --> 02:56:49.181
Thank you.

02:56:49.501 --> 02:56:50.162
Thank you for your time.

02:56:56.152 --> 02:56:56.672
Good morning.

02:56:56.873 --> 02:56:58.174
My name is Janet Davila.

02:56:58.334 --> 02:57:12.807
I have two kids attending Celeric Diet, and I'm hoping my third child could get an opportunity to attend to a school where teachers and staff show them that they care for them, to get a quality education, and to actually succeed in achieving it.

02:57:13.448 --> 02:57:21.014
For me, it's amazing to see how my kids are growing on their level of learning skills, where they are not surrounded by a lot of opportunities to succeed in life.

02:57:21.835 --> 02:57:26.969
Please don't take away my choice and opportunity for my children's education and the only school they ever know.

02:57:27.130 --> 02:57:27.451
Thank you.

02:57:37.230 --> 02:57:37.731
Good morning.

02:57:37.751 --> 02:57:42.135
My name is Rocio Perez and I am a teacher at Solarity Dyad.

02:57:43.076 --> 02:57:44.938
I'm here on behalf of Solarity Dyad.

02:57:46.480 --> 02:57:53.667
Solarity Dyad educators thrive in scaffolding the education and nurturing our scholars to success and high achievements.

02:57:54.668 --> 02:58:02.471
Solarity Diet is not just a school, but it's a family made of caring teachers, staff, parents who support our students' success daily.

02:58:04.672 --> 02:58:11.154
If our school is to close, you will be displacing 690 of our students, their extended families, and their staff.

02:58:11.234 --> 02:58:15.455
You will be taking away choices and resources from families who don't have many.

02:58:16.336 --> 02:58:22.018
I urge you to please support our students, our staff, and our parents to allow Solarity Schools to remain open.

02:58:22.418 --> 02:58:22.738
Thank you.

02:58:31.380 --> 02:58:36.862
Hi, my name is Lydia Almaraz, and I'm an alumni from Solarity Diet.

02:58:38.223 --> 02:58:53.570
I first came to this school from an LAUSD that wouldn't give me the opportunity to excel my education, knowing that I needed extra help in coming to Solarity Diet in 2005 as a third grader and getting the help that I needed.

02:58:54.470 --> 02:58:57.473
has paved the way for my education.

02:58:57.593 --> 02:59:04.759
And so and that is my brothers are going through the same thing that they need to be part of the IEP program.

02:59:05.800 --> 02:59:08.082
And being part of the IEP program has helped me a lot.

02:59:08.503 --> 02:59:09.824
It has furthered my education.

02:59:09.844 --> 02:59:18.091
I go to a high school now that accepts IEP and in the fall I will be attending a university that accepts IEP as well.

02:59:19.722 --> 02:59:36.897
And being an IEP to me has motivated me to work harder and be motivated to further my education and know that even if I have a setback in my learning disability, I will still further it.

02:59:37.117 --> 02:59:42.021
And I really hope that Celerity Diet doesn't get closed so my brothers could experience the same thing.

02:59:42.342 --> 02:59:42.602
Thank you.

02:59:51.238 --> 02:59:51.638
Good morning.

02:59:51.678 --> 02:59:52.859
My name is Erica Ramos.

02:59:52.899 --> 02:59:54.560
I am the mother of Gloria Aparicio.

02:59:55.140 --> 02:59:57.081
She's a second grader at Dyad.

02:59:58.742 --> 03:00:00.964
I am a single mother who grew up in South Central.

03:00:01.324 --> 03:00:03.565
Unfortunately, I did not graduate high school.

03:00:05.306 --> 03:00:14.891
I have the ability to send my child where she has an opportunity to get dance classes that are offered to her at the campus without no out-of-pocket charge to myself.

03:00:17.737 --> 03:00:41.746
she has experienced a more self, how do I say this, her self-esteem got raised because they had a bookmark contest which she won and she got first place and they recognized her and that gave her the opportunity to

03:00:42.759 --> 03:00:45.400
thrive and try new things for herself.

03:00:46.301 --> 03:00:48.261
She wasn't really wanting to do it.

03:00:50.482 --> 03:00:54.684
And she has been an honor roll and has gotten citizenship throughout her short time.

03:00:55.985 --> 03:00:56.265
Thank you.

03:01:04.505 --> 03:01:05.185
Hi, good morning.

03:01:05.225 --> 03:01:09.768
My name is Iman Khalil and I'm one of the fourth graders, fourth grade teachers at Solarity Dyad.

03:01:10.368 --> 03:01:15.551
At Dyad, we're a group of professionals dedicated to meeting the learning and developmental needs of all of our students.

03:01:15.971 --> 03:01:21.815
CHU supports its teachers with ongoing professional training using research proven strategies and a rigorous curriculum.

03:01:22.535 --> 03:01:28.178
Additionally, CEG provides its teachers with experienced educators and curriculum specialists to support and guide.

03:01:28.858 --> 03:01:40.444
Individualized instruction, highly qualified and trained staff and educators, integration of technology, and a whole load of love and dedication for our scholars and their families is at the heart and mind of Celerity Dyad.

03:01:41.025 --> 03:01:48.449
Together, Celerity Dyad, its eager students, and its involved families are a powerful team that have positively shaped and impacted this community.

03:01:48.849 --> 03:01:50.410
We look forward to continuing our efforts.

03:01:50.590 --> 03:01:50.830
Thank you.

03:01:57.179 --> 03:01:57.699
Good morning.

03:01:57.739 --> 03:01:59.300
My name is Yudidia De Jesus.

03:01:59.620 --> 03:02:03.181
I am a parent of a current student at Celerity Diet Charter School.

03:02:03.822 --> 03:02:06.783
My experience with Celerity has been the best.

03:02:07.083 --> 03:02:14.686
My daughter has grown tremendously both in math and English compared to when she attended a public school for pre-kinder and kinder.

03:02:15.426 --> 03:02:18.907
I noticed a big improvement by the second week at Celerity Diet.

03:02:19.527 --> 03:02:27.508
Celerity Diet has offered my daughter a small smaller class which allows her teacher to help her in the areas she struggles with the most.

03:02:28.909 --> 03:02:32.749
My daughter is much more confident and motivated to learn each day.

03:02:33.470 --> 03:02:40.371
I myself attended public schools throughout my school years so I know how hard it is to find a great school academically.

03:02:41.567 --> 03:02:49.997
We all want the best for our children, and Celerity Diet has offered my daughter the best resources, dedicated teachers, and a great staff.

03:02:50.938 --> 03:02:51.239
Thank you.

03:02:59.568 --> 03:03:00.009
Good morning.

03:03:00.089 --> 03:03:04.174
My name is Paola Carcamo and I'm a mother of a first grader attending Celerity Diet.

03:03:04.875 --> 03:03:07.038
I feel Celerity is a gem in our community.

03:03:07.458 --> 03:03:12.485
My son was diagnosed with mild autism at one and a half years old and he attended school ever since.

03:03:12.505 --> 03:03:17.311
I feel no other school before Celerity has given him the same level of attention and dedication.

03:03:18.052 --> 03:03:20.596
When my son started first grade, he had trouble adjusting.

03:03:21.377 --> 03:03:23.120
His teacher would constantly reach out to me.

03:03:23.260 --> 03:03:31.333
She would express any concern and ask what my son's preferred method of learning was and what she could do to help him not only academically, but also emotionally.

03:03:32.682 --> 03:03:36.246
She has gone above and beyond to make sure my son reaches his academic goals.

03:03:36.907 --> 03:03:42.754
Through his IEP, we were able to come up with a strategy that would help him navigate his daily routine, and it has paid off.

03:03:43.315 --> 03:03:46.478
He was on the honor roll in the first trimester and continues to excel.

03:03:47.159 --> 03:03:51.304
I am happy that if any concern arises on either end, we can always text each other.

03:03:52.566 --> 03:03:57.937
All the staff at Celerity are committed to making students' days fulfilling and ready to help whenever needed.

03:03:58.478 --> 03:04:00.342
Celerity has been great for our family.

03:04:00.442 --> 03:04:03.489
We see the improvements in my son and we couldn't be happier.

03:04:11.101 --> 03:04:16.865
Good morning, my name is Karina Costa and I'm here to honor to support the renewal of Slurry Diet Charged School.

03:04:17.545 --> 03:04:24.030
My son is in second grade and as a parent I want to give the best education for my son and Slurry Diet is the option.

03:04:24.210 --> 03:04:30.294
I graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School in 2006 and witnessed the rise among students black versus brown.

03:04:30.774 --> 03:04:33.235
I did not have teachers in the classroom to sit down and learn.

03:04:33.455 --> 03:04:37.777
The lack of education from the Unified District School I struggled during my college degree.

03:04:38.058 --> 03:04:42.800
Fortunately I was able to receive my BA in history in Costa Dominguez Hills in 2012.

03:04:43.260 --> 03:04:48.002
Therefore I would not like to my son to suffer the same struggles I faced attending Unified District School.

03:04:48.522 --> 03:04:53.745
Solarius is a school that gives love support and attention to the students parents and community.

03:04:54.085 --> 03:04:54.405
Thank you.

03:04:59.788 --> 03:05:00.008
Thank you.

03:05:00.498 --> 03:05:01.318
Hi, good morning, everyone.

03:05:02.739 --> 03:05:03.960
My name is Karla Lavadores.

03:05:04.240 --> 03:05:05.821
I am a mother of two kids.

03:05:06.261 --> 03:05:07.161
One is in second grade.

03:05:07.361 --> 03:05:08.482
The other is in fifth grade.

03:05:09.803 --> 03:05:14.125
And first, I would like to thank you for the time and the opportunity to tell you my opinion.

03:05:14.705 --> 03:05:22.889
In case that you decide to close our school, you should know that you are taking away the opportunity for my children to have a better future.

03:05:23.590 --> 03:05:27.091
Because as you can see, Celerity Diet is a good school.

03:05:27.612 --> 03:05:29.733
For me, the best school in my neighborhood.

03:05:30.613 --> 03:05:31.334
Let me tell you why.

03:05:31.974 --> 03:05:34.897
My oldest son started at fourth grade at Dyett.

03:05:35.437 --> 03:05:40.061
When he got accepted, his reading level was very low.

03:05:40.321 --> 03:05:42.663
He was reading as a second grade level.

03:05:43.543 --> 03:05:51.409
At this time, he's up to grade two level, and he's already reclassified as an English-only speaker.

03:05:52.090 --> 03:05:58.375
I know that you are concerned about the education of our children, and if you really care about them,

03:05:59.500 --> 03:06:10.264
Please do not deny them the opportunity to have a good education in a place where our children are educated with values and they are treated like a family.

03:06:10.604 --> 03:06:10.884
Thank you.

03:06:24.008 --> 03:06:26.769
Ken Bird on behalf of the California Teachers Association.

03:06:27.398 --> 03:06:28.138
I have a request.

03:06:28.158 --> 03:06:30.039
I don't want it to come against my time.

03:06:30.719 --> 03:06:32.940
I'm going to speak on 17 and 18.

03:06:33.860 --> 03:06:35.701
I'd like my two minutes now.

03:06:36.361 --> 03:06:39.242
Is that— And you can't come back?

03:06:39.442 --> 03:06:39.842
Okay.

03:06:39.942 --> 03:06:40.522
I promise.

03:06:40.702 --> 03:06:41.082
All right.

03:06:42.043 --> 03:06:44.223
If you guys vote no right now, I'll leave.

03:06:45.284 --> 03:06:45.744
Okay.

03:06:45.784 --> 03:06:46.164
Go ahead.

03:06:46.724 --> 03:06:47.324
That's a deal.

03:06:47.824 --> 03:06:48.445
All right.

03:06:48.945 --> 03:06:49.265
Thank you.

03:06:52.674 --> 03:06:55.356
The cart is before the horse on this item.

03:06:55.456 --> 03:07:04.744
The idea that if this charter school does all these things to satisfy all these conditions, the department will determine X is the case.

03:07:05.205 --> 03:07:06.406
That's entirely wrong.

03:07:07.086 --> 03:07:08.707
The facts should be brought forth.

03:07:09.128 --> 03:07:10.789
It should be done in a public meeting.

03:07:11.510 --> 03:07:12.391
You should have it.

03:07:12.731 --> 03:07:17.995
We should get up and argue and say, did they really make the showing that there's not a problem?

03:07:19.562 --> 03:07:26.966
I don't mean to be disrespectful, but when all the conditions were read, I almost said, well, maybe they should take a daily lie detector test too.

03:07:27.666 --> 03:07:32.248
In other words, and then report back later to see if they continue to tell the truth.

03:07:32.989 --> 03:07:34.490
The cart is before the horse.

03:07:34.950 --> 03:07:42.434
The other thing is, I get calls from people in the legislature, and they ask me, I'll clean it up a little bit, what's the board doing?

03:07:44.214 --> 03:07:46.075
Why did they act on this last thing?

03:07:46.736 --> 03:07:49.277
What happened to common sense when you come to Sacramento?

03:07:49.690 --> 03:07:52.073
Do you pack it up in a suitcase or what?

03:07:52.934 --> 03:08:06.910
And so I guess all I'm really going to say is I wrote a fairly long letter going back to one concept, and mercifully, maybe the legislature will limit your authority in this area, and that is

03:08:07.728 --> 03:08:10.370
the local school district, respectfully.

03:08:10.911 --> 03:08:17.356
The local school district's in a position to know what's going on, and they have to work with these groups, and they have to work together.

03:08:17.877 --> 03:08:20.099
And this is just out of control.

03:08:20.819 --> 03:08:25.183
I guess the best way for me to put it together is, Sunday is Mother's Day.

03:08:25.203 --> 03:08:34.331
And I don't know about your mother, but I remember my mother told me, if you fool me once, shame on you.

03:08:35.660 --> 03:08:39.524
But if you fool me twice, shame on me.

03:08:51.468 --> 03:08:54.531
Lorraine Richard on behalf of California Teachers Association.

03:08:54.851 --> 03:08:57.013
CTA is opposed to the petition.

03:08:57.213 --> 03:09:09.703
Similar to what I had expressed previously, local control is essential to maximize education of all students and democracy is practiced at the local level in order to elect those individuals to be on the school board.

03:09:09.763 --> 03:09:17.630
Similar to Los Angeles Unified School District, those individuals were elected and they have denied the charter petition.

03:09:18.270 --> 03:09:26.580
And as we know, there are other charters that are in Ally Unified, but this one is not meeting their requirements to approve it.

03:09:27.440 --> 03:09:30.204
Also, fiscal matters of education need to be addressed.

03:09:30.404 --> 03:09:34.008
We've heard great stories of success and successful students.

03:09:34.048 --> 03:09:37.592
I'm sure the students work very hard and the educators work very hard at the school.

03:09:38.252 --> 03:09:43.835
But there is also another side to an operation of the school and those are obligations of fiscal matters.

03:09:44.515 --> 03:09:50.177
And since those need to be addressed, those monies are also being kept essentially from the success of the students.

03:09:50.857 --> 03:09:55.439
So in this case, we've also have heard and have seen documents.

03:09:56.240 --> 03:09:57.660
Is there clarity?

03:09:58.141 --> 03:09:58.421
Sorry.

03:09:58.661 --> 03:09:58.961
Thank you.

03:10:05.165 --> 03:10:08.267
Good morning, Michelle Lynch on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association.

03:10:08.928 --> 03:10:12.270
As you can see, this is a very high performing school with a lot of support in the community.

03:10:12.390 --> 03:10:23.479
We want to thank the CDE for working with the school since the ACCS meeting and since they submitted this petition and for their willingness to continue to work with the school if you do approve it today to ensure these kids continue to be served.

03:10:24.139 --> 03:10:26.101
We do ask today that you approve this appeal.

03:10:26.161 --> 03:10:26.441
Thank you.

03:10:31.912 --> 03:10:33.733
Eric Premack Charter Schools Development Center.

03:10:33.913 --> 03:10:42.638
We support the staff recommendation and commend both the staff and even LA Unified for their hard work in trying to understand this complex corporate environment.

03:10:43.539 --> 03:10:51.344
While it is complex, it is increasingly common in the charter sector and it's extremely common in the large-scale nonprofit sector generally as well.

03:10:51.444 --> 03:10:53.725
It does raise a lot of interesting questions about

03:10:54.105 --> 03:11:03.588
transparency, how deep do we look, how do we build the capacity of authorizers to do that complicated work when we rely on districts, many of which don't have the staff to do it, to do it.

03:11:04.328 --> 03:11:18.152
And we do need to resolve those issues, but I hope that that won't hold up the approval of a charter here that's from an excellent organization with a strong track record and very sophisticated board and management.

03:11:18.272 --> 03:11:18.572
Thank you.

03:11:22.635 --> 03:11:24.237
And that ends the public comment.

03:11:24.318 --> 03:11:24.538
All right.

03:11:24.718 --> 03:11:27.802
I think this is a good time for the board members to get your lunch.

03:11:27.842 --> 03:11:30.646
We're going to bring them back into the room.

03:11:30.746 --> 03:11:34.992
So we'll adjourn and reconvene at 12.07.

03:11:46.934 --> 03:11:55.363
All right, the State Board will reconvene and at this point, we're ready for board comments.

03:11:56.805 --> 03:12:06.215
Typically, the liaisons to the charter school area and the people that attend the advisory committee on charter schools lead off.

03:12:06.275 --> 03:12:07.777
So, I'll see if...

03:12:12.660 --> 03:12:15.161
It looks like Bruce would like to make a comment.

03:12:15.201 --> 03:12:15.642
Yeah.

03:12:17.603 --> 03:12:25.407
I think I will pass at this moment because there were a number of outstanding questions I think the board members wanted to have answered.

03:12:25.967 --> 03:12:27.948
Okay.

03:12:28.328 --> 03:12:29.629
Board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

03:12:32.323 --> 03:12:36.887
First of all, I want to thank the parents and the students and the teachers that have joined us today.

03:12:37.507 --> 03:12:41.410
We actually have something that we share in common.

03:12:41.450 --> 03:12:47.916
We both want quality educational opportunities for our students, in particular students in some of the most neglected communities.

03:12:48.976 --> 03:12:52.620
But we're also looking at different things, right?

03:12:52.660 --> 03:12:57.204
I'm looking at the entire structure that was presented today, not just the school site level.

03:12:57.785 --> 03:13:00.167
And it's great that you have a positive experience.

03:13:00.187 --> 03:13:02.609
That is what's expected in any school.

03:13:04.071 --> 03:13:07.914
I have a question about everything else that's happening above the school.

03:13:08.815 --> 03:13:08.935
And

03:13:09.716 --> 03:13:15.297
And I really have to just lead with this federal investigation and some of the allegations.

03:13:15.777 --> 03:13:20.899
And I want to know what are the allegations and how are you responding to those allegations?

03:13:21.439 --> 03:13:28.980
How are you explaining this to parents, to community members, to all of those who have entrusted you with their students' education?

03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:29.620
Thank you.

03:13:29.640 --> 03:13:36.102
Thank you for the question.

03:13:36.122 --> 03:13:36.382
First of all,

03:13:37.423 --> 03:13:40.625
Again, I'm glad we have the opportunity to address the question.

03:13:40.645 --> 03:13:41.986
I don't think your mic is on.

03:13:43.547 --> 03:13:44.148
The red mic is on.

03:13:44.188 --> 03:13:47.950
You should be good.

03:13:47.970 --> 03:13:48.451
You're okay.

03:13:48.471 --> 03:13:49.011
Go ahead.

03:13:49.051 --> 03:13:49.351
Okay.

03:13:51.573 --> 03:13:52.934
We really do welcome the question.

03:13:53.494 --> 03:13:54.835
We feel it's important.

03:13:55.195 --> 03:13:56.576
It's important to our board members.

03:13:57.617 --> 03:13:58.978
It's important to our stakeholders.

03:14:01.202 --> 03:14:04.607
Let me give you a little background on the investigation that I think is important.

03:14:04.928 --> 03:14:16.825
First of all, the questions that were originally raised and presented to Solarity were presented in the beginning of June of 2015 in connection with an LAUSD OIG audit.

03:14:18.137 --> 03:14:25.667
That audit took place for about six months and I know personally because I was involved in responding to the questions that the district posed.

03:14:26.368 --> 03:14:31.856
The district sent staff and auditors to Solarity's administrative site.

03:14:32.497 --> 03:14:34.459
They went over all of our documents and records.

03:14:35.080 --> 03:14:38.804
I've heard them say here today that there has been a lack of transparency.

03:14:39.344 --> 03:14:52.177
I find that mystifying because we have answered questions, we have created charts, we have created spreadsheets for them in response to their questions that were originally all arose out of the OIG audit.

03:14:53.278 --> 03:15:02.965
After about six months, we had asked whether or not we would have the opportunity to take a look at a draft audit report, and they said no, which was okay.

03:15:03.245 --> 03:15:05.526
We expected that, but then we never heard anything.

03:15:06.587 --> 03:15:11.030
We didn't hear anything in connection with the OIG audit, and we never have.

03:15:11.170 --> 03:15:12.411
There's never been a draft audit.

03:15:12.471 --> 03:15:20.977
There have never been any negative findings, and many of the same questions that I've heard them say today were raised now over two years ago.

03:15:22.674 --> 03:15:34.093
We fast forward to January 25 of this year, when we first became aware that there was a federal investigation through the Department of Ed Office of the Inspector General.

03:15:35.441 --> 03:15:39.023
This issue was raised last time we were here in front of the ACCS.

03:15:39.464 --> 03:15:52.011
And standing at this very podium, I said the same thing that I'm going to say now, which is, it is our understanding from our communications with the US Attorney's Office that LAUSD is the complainant in that investigation.

03:15:52.592 --> 03:16:04.279
And I said at that time, back then, I asked the ACCS commissioners to ask LAUSD, are you the complainant in connection with the federal investigation?

03:16:05.257 --> 03:16:07.478
Or they can come up and deny it, and they never did.

03:16:08.478 --> 03:16:19.581
We believe that the district actually, not having successfully convinced their auditors to receive a negative audit report, presented the same allegations to the US Attorney's Office.

03:16:20.082 --> 03:16:23.183
For what it's worth, I'm very familiar with this US Attorney's Office.

03:16:23.763 --> 03:16:26.063
I was a federal prosecutor myself for 11 years.

03:16:26.684 --> 03:16:33.386
I was the Deputy Chief of Public Corruption and Government Fraud, the very section that would be responsible for this investigation.

03:16:34.486 --> 03:16:36.327
if I were working at this time.

03:16:37.147 --> 03:16:46.590
And I myself have supervised, in fact, conducted many United States Department of Education Office of Inspector General cases, criminal cases.

03:16:47.510 --> 03:16:52.852
And I can tell you that from our understanding, we are continually communicating with the U.S.

03:16:52.872 --> 03:16:53.492
Attorney's Office.

03:16:53.512 --> 03:16:55.513
In fact, we did so just as of yesterday.

03:16:56.453 --> 03:16:58.193
There have been no subpoenas.

03:16:58.414 --> 03:16:59.734
There have been no interviews.

03:17:00.575 --> 03:17:08.661
We have no reason to believe anybody at CEG, any of its board members, any of its officers, are targets of this investigation.

03:17:09.462 --> 03:17:19.870
They have our documents and records, which we would be happy to provide them, and we have been providing them with information, and we'll continue to cooperate to resolve this investigation.

03:17:20.510 --> 03:17:22.311
So, I mean, I have to say,

03:17:24.332 --> 03:17:29.315
We take the existence of any investigation with great gravity.

03:17:30.195 --> 03:17:44.162
But I think it's also worth knowing that this appears all of the things that you are hearing about from the CTA and other comments have followed on the existence of the federal investigation.

03:17:44.402 --> 03:17:45.903
The federal investigation began.

03:17:46.343 --> 03:17:48.304
Then there began LA Times articles.

03:17:48.924 --> 03:17:49.685
Then after that,

03:17:50.902 --> 03:17:53.565
Compton asked, well, what about the LA Times articles?

03:17:54.006 --> 03:17:56.849
And then WASP asked, well, what about the LA Times articles?

03:17:57.449 --> 03:18:00.653
And ACC asked, well, what about the federal investigation?

03:18:00.993 --> 03:18:02.395
And we're addressing it here today.

03:18:03.516 --> 03:18:04.597
We're happy to do so.

03:18:05.058 --> 03:18:08.161
We're happy to deal with specific issues that arise with it.

03:18:08.702 --> 03:18:10.925
But if LAUSD is the complainant,

03:18:11.505 --> 03:18:16.468
And it is the same things that they raised two years ago, that we don't have a negative audit report.

03:18:16.909 --> 03:18:24.654
That also should factor into your consideration as to whether or not there is evidence of fraud or anything else.

03:18:25.134 --> 03:18:25.914
And let me say this.

03:18:27.235 --> 03:18:36.641
I heard somewhere in the presentations that there are, that there are, quote, allegations of fraud against CEG.

03:18:37.902 --> 03:18:39.143
That could, that

03:18:40.982 --> 03:18:42.204
is completely untrue.

03:18:44.488 --> 03:18:49.596
The search warrants that took place, all the affidavits are all under seal.

03:18:49.977 --> 03:18:53.903
But there are no allegations of fraud against anyone at this juncture.

03:18:54.867 --> 03:18:55.087
None.

03:18:55.768 --> 03:19:04.273
And if there is any, I invite whoever is saying that there are allegations of fraud to come up and explain specifically where they have heard those.

03:19:04.753 --> 03:19:08.255
Because I am in constant communication with the very assistant U.S.

03:19:08.295 --> 03:19:11.097
attorneys that are running this case.

03:19:11.737 --> 03:19:14.939
And they haven't told me that in response to direct questions.

03:19:15.519 --> 03:19:21.662
So, in terms of communication, we have tried to communicate what we can about this.

03:19:22.082 --> 03:19:26.264
And, you know, we are still going to work through this.

03:19:26.324 --> 03:19:28.345
We believe all of this is resolvable.

03:19:29.466 --> 03:19:37.630
And we believe that in many ways this is a waterfall, a waterfall, the head of which actually began with LAUSD itself.

03:19:39.154 --> 03:19:41.835
But let me leave that point aside for a moment.

03:19:42.195 --> 03:19:58.240
I do want to emphasize one overriding message to the board, and that is celerity is not wedded to any corporate structure.

03:19:58.741 --> 03:20:02.042
We are not here to say we have a corporate structure in the past.

03:20:02.402 --> 03:20:03.182
We want to keep it.

03:20:05.248 --> 03:20:07.029
Nothing could be further from the truth.

03:20:07.690 --> 03:20:14.034
We actually would want to work with you to have direction from you as to what you would like to see.

03:20:14.695 --> 03:20:26.283
And leaving aside what is legal, what happens in other nonprofit settings, leaving all of that issue aside, we'll do, in essence, what is necessary to keep our schools running.

03:20:27.130 --> 03:20:36.474
That, plain and simple, we are not here to argue about legality or how a statutory sole member structure works for other nonprofits, even though it is a common thing.

03:20:36.774 --> 03:20:41.216
We're not going to point out, well, other charter schools, in fact, have the very same structure and they've been approved.

03:20:41.657 --> 03:20:48.080
And we don't even have to get to the point where LAUSD previously approved this very same structure in connection with Himalayan Rollas.

03:20:48.100 --> 03:20:49.580
We don't have to do that, OK?

03:20:50.241 --> 03:20:52.842
We are here to tell you we're happy to change.

03:20:53.722 --> 03:21:00.648
And frankly, one of the things I didn't get to mention is we passed two, the board passed two resolutions.

03:21:00.969 --> 03:21:05.773
The second resolution was specifically an Audit and Compliance Committee.

03:21:06.754 --> 03:21:12.339
The Audit and Compliance Committee of the board has been charged with, among other things,

03:21:13.729 --> 03:21:24.196
managing and supervising the management audit that was one of the conditions that the recommendation, staff recommendations to the board, and they will manage that process.

03:21:24.236 --> 03:21:29.019
In fact, Ron Ben-Yehuda and Kurt Hessler are on that subcommittee.

03:21:29.619 --> 03:21:33.702
And there's a, there's an actual auditor, Francisco Mares, who's on that committee too.

03:21:34.662 --> 03:21:46.848
So, what we are trying to communicate to the board is that since the time that we had our last hearing, there have been enormous steps forward.

03:21:47.869 --> 03:21:52.051
We are not wedded to having global provide services.

03:21:52.531 --> 03:21:55.913
There was a time in the beginning of Solarity's

03:21:57.549 --> 03:22:01.933
building of its structure when it was not only appropriate, but it was necessary.

03:22:02.834 --> 03:22:08.039
But as I said before, as we have matured through our organizational growth, we can look at

03:22:09.435 --> 03:22:11.656
hiring those individual services out, and we have.

03:22:11.696 --> 03:22:16.997
I mean, we have now issued RFPs, or we actually are about to issue RFPs for specific services.

03:22:17.457 --> 03:22:28.040
We're advertising for specific employee positions that would cover some of the global services, and we are actively pursuing all of that.

03:22:29.180 --> 03:22:43.356
With respect to transparency, we are about to make live a tab on our website that's going to post all the documents that we've posted to staff there so that anyone can see them.

03:22:44.217 --> 03:22:45.999
So we're going to have a transparency website.

03:22:48.494 --> 03:22:52.615
I'm going to interject because I don't believe that you answered my question.

03:22:53.015 --> 03:22:56.176
But I want to make sure that my colleagues also have an opportunity.

03:22:57.596 --> 03:23:03.837
I was part of the yes vote in the previous two and I had a lot of concerns back then.

03:23:04.477 --> 03:23:06.698
And I continue to have some of these concerns.

03:23:07.078 --> 03:23:14.019
I don't believe that I got an answer from what you said, but I'm glad that there is some steps towards transparency.

03:23:14.739 --> 03:23:16.620
I think that there is a little bit of perception here.

03:23:16.640 --> 03:23:19.360
You know, I was looking at your fiction and facts really quickly.

03:23:19.441 --> 03:23:22.221
And the first one, I had a question about Ms.

03:23:22.281 --> 03:23:23.062
McFarlane.

03:23:23.182 --> 03:23:25.222
And then I was wondering, where is she?

03:23:25.542 --> 03:23:26.343
You know, where is Ms.

03:23:26.383 --> 03:23:26.863
McFarlane?

03:23:26.883 --> 03:23:30.524
And people identified her in different places in this org here.

03:23:31.364 --> 03:23:42.608
But what I think what's interesting about the fact versus fiction is that her salary being compared to Dr. King's salary and saying, you know, it's apples to apples.

03:23:44.109 --> 03:23:47.792
One had to oversee less than 4,000 students.

03:23:48.293 --> 03:23:49.914
The other has to oversee about 500,000.

03:23:50.415 --> 03:23:52.456
That's not apples to apples.

03:23:52.937 --> 03:24:02.446
And so just looking at that fiction fact, that perspective alone just kind of shows me a little bit of how the lens that's being used to look at this.

03:24:02.786 --> 03:24:03.086
Thank you.

03:24:03.967 --> 03:24:04.367
Thank you.

03:24:04.388 --> 03:24:06.389
Yeah, I think she has no further questions.

03:24:07.506 --> 03:24:10.809
So, and let me discuss a little procedure.

03:24:10.829 --> 03:24:11.709
You're dismissed.

03:24:11.729 --> 03:24:13.270
Thank you.

03:24:13.851 --> 03:24:22.437
About, it seems to me that we ought to let LA Unified respond to these kinds of comments immediately.

03:24:22.777 --> 03:24:25.459
If I go through the queue, we get sort of off of it.

03:24:26.160 --> 03:24:32.665
And I think it's only fair since a lot of allegations were made about LA Unified that they have a chance to respond to this.

03:24:40.700 --> 03:24:42.001
Thank you, President Kirsten.

03:24:46.583 --> 03:24:57.648
I think the first allegation or statement that was made by Mr. Suss that LAUSD is the complainant regarding the federal investigation, we would just like to clarify.

03:24:58.720 --> 03:25:04.622
We are here today regarding the findings of fact made in October of 2016 regarding these two schools.

03:25:04.742 --> 03:25:08.783
Those were based on oversight findings by the Charter Schools Division.

03:25:09.383 --> 03:25:16.065
The OIG is an independent agency, independent body from LA Unified School District.

03:25:16.145 --> 03:25:23.948
It's a statutorily independent investigatory agency, and we do not have information regarding the investigation.

03:25:25.154 --> 03:25:29.177
I am not sure what the relevance is, whether or not LAUC is the complainant or not.

03:25:29.537 --> 03:25:37.462
I'm not a white criminal defense attorney like Mr. Suh is, so I actually do not know how to respond to those allegations.

03:25:40.044 --> 03:25:43.006
Any other comments you want to make about anything he said?

03:25:46.021 --> 03:25:46.902
You have a question for them?

03:25:47.182 --> 03:25:48.402
That was the primary one.

03:25:49.703 --> 03:25:56.967
One other comment that was made was that LA Unified School District has approved other charter schools with sole statutory members.

03:25:57.007 --> 03:25:58.148
That's absolutely correct.

03:25:58.889 --> 03:26:11.056
The big differences in this case is that in those charter school organizations, they have either proactively come to us to discuss the governance change and the creation of a statutory member,

03:26:11.716 --> 03:26:17.660
We have had the opportunity to vet those affiliation agreements that they have created.

03:26:18.180 --> 03:26:28.107
We have established parameters regarding the relationship between the Charter Authorizing Governing Board and the sole statutory member.

03:26:28.928 --> 03:26:36.493
And in other instances where they have already established a sole statutory organization, we have not had any pushback regarding

03:26:37.453 --> 03:26:42.722
obtaining information documentation of the sole statutory member corporation.

03:26:43.993 --> 03:27:00.160
And that's the problem with that organizational structure, is that, you know, many times when things were asked previously of Solarity, it was, you know, we're a different organization, they're not a part of us.

03:27:00.200 --> 03:27:02.601
But as you can see, they definitely are.

03:27:03.201 --> 03:27:06.002
And the sole statutory member is definitely connected.

03:27:06.603 --> 03:27:11.665
And we can't trace the money there because they're not public agencies.

03:27:12.185 --> 03:27:13.125
They're non-profits.

03:27:13.705 --> 03:27:17.606
They're not, we don't, so we can't get an audit.

03:27:17.666 --> 03:27:22.987
Now, many of our schools voluntarily give us audits of the sole statutory, but we can't demand that.

03:27:24.247 --> 03:27:28.328
So once money is transferred over into that, it's kind of like a black hole.

03:27:28.628 --> 03:27:32.729
We don't know where it goes, and it's public money, and that's what concerns us.

03:27:32.789 --> 03:27:36.290
And what concerns us even more is that we're talking about seven schools today.

03:27:37.230 --> 03:27:42.513
And we've already spent hours trying to understand the management of seven schools.

03:27:42.553 --> 03:27:43.814
I don't wrap my head around it.

03:27:45.095 --> 03:27:46.315
Hey, who's next on the queue?

03:27:46.796 --> 03:27:47.436
Pat Parker.

03:27:48.477 --> 03:27:48.957
Patricia.

03:27:49.337 --> 03:27:49.817
Patricia.

03:27:49.837 --> 03:27:52.039
Okay, I have a question for you.

03:27:52.639 --> 03:28:02.405
In your presentation, you enumerated three corporate rights that Global has concerning the fiscal management of CEG.

03:28:02.425 --> 03:28:05.046
Did you enumerate with those three corporate rights?

03:28:05.186 --> 03:28:05.626
I'm sorry.

03:28:06.167 --> 03:28:06.347
Yes.

03:28:06.761 --> 03:28:14.222
Yes, the first one is the power to elect and remove celerity educational group board members.

03:28:14.983 --> 03:28:17.883
The second is to dispose CEG assets.

03:28:18.863 --> 03:28:22.764
The third is to merge CEG with other corporations.

03:28:23.224 --> 03:28:25.865
And there's actually a fourth one, the power to dissolve corporation.

03:28:30.326 --> 03:28:31.666
Merge with other corporations.

03:28:34.716 --> 03:28:38.139
dispose, merge, and dissolve, basically.

03:28:39.820 --> 03:28:40.301
You're welcome.

03:28:42.243 --> 03:28:42.803
Who's next?

03:28:44.084 --> 03:28:44.465
Pardon?

03:28:44.485 --> 03:28:44.645
Okay.

03:28:44.685 --> 03:28:45.786
LA, please stay.

03:28:55.774 --> 03:29:02.117
It's just a follow-up and I'm not sure if you're the right one to answer it, but I am mystified by this sole statutory member.

03:29:02.337 --> 03:29:05.019
What is the purpose of establishing that?

03:29:08.280 --> 03:29:13.803
It's a question that actually the Charter Schools Division, the district, our board has grappled with.

03:29:14.643 --> 03:29:23.067
And our understanding is, I mean, let me start by saying that it's actually in the California Corporations Code, Section 5056.

03:29:24.868 --> 03:29:29.715
So it is a legal statutory right to establish these kinds of corporations.

03:29:30.175 --> 03:29:38.967
When I've drilled down in discussions with other counsel for charter management organizations as to what the purpose is for a membership organization,

03:29:40.648 --> 03:29:41.808
there are various reasons.

03:29:42.128 --> 03:29:56.972
One is to basically, as stated by CEG today, is to separate the local kind of governance of the group with fundraising duties of a higher organization.

03:29:57.272 --> 03:30:00.573
I'm not saying that that's the structure that Global and CEG has.

03:30:00.593 --> 03:30:02.453
That's one of the reasons that's been provided.

03:30:03.273 --> 03:30:16.925
Another one that has been stated is something that I am not wholly familiar with, but has been provided to us as a rationale, which is related with IRS regulations regarding nonprofits.

03:30:18.922 --> 03:30:19.984
Those are some of the reasons.

03:30:21.125 --> 03:30:28.456
But as we've been pretty public about our position regarding sole statutory memberships, we do have concerns.

03:30:28.637 --> 03:30:34.686
Nonetheless, we do have these organizations and we're trying to work around their corporate structures.

03:30:35.446 --> 03:30:43.192
and making sure that we have oversight over the dealings between the charter school and the sole statutory member.

03:30:44.572 --> 03:30:51.417
We have introduced legislation limiting the powers of sole statutory memberships vis-a-vis the charter schools.

03:30:51.897 --> 03:30:54.279
We do not think that it's wholly aligned.

03:30:54.979 --> 03:31:04.826
Unfortunately, that legislation has not come to pass, but we have been pretty public about our position, our legal position regarding sole statutory membership.

03:31:05.146 --> 03:31:17.694
And we have added language in our petitions for those schools that have it, that by virtue of the charter itself grants us more access.

03:31:21.056 --> 03:31:23.718
I have a question.

03:31:23.778 --> 03:31:23.938
Yes.

03:31:26.659 --> 03:31:29.141
I think it's going to be a back and forth deal.

03:31:34.966 --> 03:31:37.007
So, I want to make sure I know who I'm speaking with.

03:31:37.547 --> 03:31:38.668
Could you identify yourselves?

03:31:39.088 --> 03:31:40.028
My name is Greta Proctor.

03:31:40.048 --> 03:31:43.109
I'm an attorney at Procopio and we represent Solarity Educational Group.

03:31:43.930 --> 03:31:46.631
And again, Maurice Sa from Gibson Dunn.

03:31:47.171 --> 03:31:48.111
And you're representing?

03:31:48.512 --> 03:31:48.952
Solarity.

03:31:49.252 --> 03:31:56.915
So, both of you represent Solarity, but can you speak on behalf of or answer questions that I would have concerning the authority of Global?

03:31:57.095 --> 03:31:57.535
Absolutely.

03:31:57.915 --> 03:31:58.195
Okay.

03:31:58.736 --> 03:31:58.916
So,

03:32:00.074 --> 03:32:20.912
My first question is, I heard you say in response to questions from board member Ortiz-Licone, that you are already pursuing contracts or agreements with other vendors that would supplement, supplant or altogether replace some of the agreements that you have in place with Global.

03:32:20.972 --> 03:32:21.713
Is that correct?

03:32:22.293 --> 03:32:23.394
That is correct.

03:32:23.935 --> 03:32:25.996
And moreover, we have just passed... Okay.

03:32:27.157 --> 03:32:28.478
I just want to, let me stick with that.

03:32:28.978 --> 03:32:39.585
And so in doing that, would any of those changes be a material revision in what's actually written in your charter right now concerning your organization and governance structure?

03:32:40.988 --> 03:32:57.408
And because of the potential that changing the corporate structure and or the contracts could create a material revision, we've reached out to LAUSD and CDE as authorizers to go through that process collaboratively, which is why the board hasn't taken firm steps yet.

03:32:57.688 --> 03:33:01.994
Okay, so he said no, and you said to the extent it could, you're going to take some other steps.

03:33:02.314 --> 03:33:07.421
So it's either yes, it's a material revision, or I don't know, or no, it's not.

03:33:07.882 --> 03:33:09.083
That's not exactly accurate.

03:33:09.184 --> 03:33:11.326
There's a fourth answer, which is maybe.

03:33:11.527 --> 03:33:15.212
It depends on how much of the services are contracted out to other entities.

03:33:15.672 --> 03:33:21.536
So, to the extent that you're pulling out a small piece of what Global does and putting it to another vendor, that's not a material revision.

03:33:21.836 --> 03:33:28.841
To the extent that you're pulling out all of the contracted services, I think that that probably would be a material revision, but we'd want to talk to the authorizer about that.

03:33:29.061 --> 03:33:29.301
Okay.

03:33:29.361 --> 03:33:34.804
Is Global actually able, since Global has these enumerated corporate rights over CEG,

03:33:35.905 --> 03:33:41.111
And okay, so before I ask these next couple of questions, let me just be transparent.

03:33:41.391 --> 03:33:47.738
I was the no vote in November concerning approving the other charter that you had before the board.

03:33:48.358 --> 03:33:53.804
So in asking these questions, I'm not posing them to propose a condition for approving your

03:33:55.846 --> 03:33:58.728
charter today either for item 17 or item 18.

03:33:59.129 --> 03:34:08.035
I want to understand going forward what changes could be contemplated by you to address the serious concerns we have about your governance structure.

03:34:08.515 --> 03:34:15.140
Is global actually able to relinquish or nullify their power to elect and remove the board?

03:34:16.501 --> 03:34:21.324
Is Solarity actually able to pass a resolution demanding that global do that?

03:34:22.597 --> 03:34:27.938
Is Global actually able to nullify or surrender their power to dispose of CEG assets?

03:34:29.459 --> 03:34:35.820
The relinquishment of the sole membership would relinquish the rights that are provided under statute, which have been misconstrued a bit.

03:34:36.020 --> 03:34:42.961
But yes, that bundle... Okay, in regards of whether they've been misconstrued, is that something that Global is able to nullify or surrender as a right?

03:34:43.182 --> 03:34:43.382
Yes.

03:34:44.802 --> 03:34:49.843
And is that something that the CEG board has to take action to request or can Global just simply do that?

03:34:50.267 --> 03:34:51.067
level can do that.

03:34:51.147 --> 03:34:55.349
But again, it creates a material revision issue, which is why it has not been done up to this.

03:34:55.469 --> 03:34:57.070
Since November, it has not been done.

03:34:57.110 --> 03:35:01.432
You knew this was an issue that was raised by the board in November by me in particular.

03:35:01.772 --> 03:35:03.892
And you're coming back to this board today.

03:35:04.253 --> 03:35:10.455
And that is not something that you addressed or discussed up until the moment it was asked by board member Ortiz-Lincoln.

03:35:10.795 --> 03:35:14.857
And now you're telling me that this is something you could do, but it just hasn't been done.

03:35:15.362 --> 03:35:16.824
I want to be clear about the timeline.

03:35:17.184 --> 03:35:24.713
As soon as we left this board meeting, the CEG board openly and transparently discussed at a board meeting in early December changing the structure.

03:35:24.893 --> 03:35:35.866
However, changing that structure midstream while an appeal is pending would mean that this board couldn't have heard the appeals for these Dyett and Troika charters, which were non-renewed

03:35:36.386 --> 03:35:37.167
Well, that's not true.

03:35:37.187 --> 03:35:48.201
This board has been very flexible in working with a lot of charters that have had to make some changes that the local and the county offices could not consider.

03:35:48.561 --> 03:35:52.126
This board has been very flexible in working with charters

03:35:52.426 --> 03:35:57.969
that have come up to the board on appeal and you have made both technical and very material revisions.

03:35:58.249 --> 03:36:07.454
Well, I don't mean you, but some of those charters have made both technical and very material revisions as part of the conditions that the board approved for approving those charters.

03:36:07.474 --> 03:36:08.915
So, that's not actually accurate.

03:36:09.135 --> 03:36:20.080
So, a similar, another charter school made a similar change midstream while on appeal and that was determined to remove this board's jurisdiction to hear the appeal.

03:36:20.520 --> 03:36:21.561
That was the authority.

03:36:21.912 --> 03:36:24.754
I understand what you're saying, but it's just not true that it hasn't happened.

03:36:24.774 --> 03:36:30.118
This board has actually done some of those changes as part of the conditions for approving the charter.

03:36:30.138 --> 03:36:34.582
But again, I'm not asking those questions to suggest another condition.

03:36:34.602 --> 03:36:41.287
I just want to be clear on exactly what kind of autonomy the CEG board actually has from global.

03:36:41.667 --> 03:36:45.668
And I heard you saying, I know you want to answer this question, so I'm going to come back to you so you can answer it.

03:36:46.068 --> 03:36:56.772
So you're telling me the CEG board actually can contract with other vendors even though the funds, it seems like the control of the funds to pay for those contracts belong to Global.

03:36:56.792 --> 03:37:02.474
What I heard you say is you all are in the middle of contracting for some of those services that will go away from Global?

03:37:02.894 --> 03:37:06.415
What I was saying, to be clear, is that we have formed

03:37:07.469 --> 03:37:25.700
The board has formed an audit and compliance committee as well as passed a resolution to look at finding other resources that Global is currently providing and that they have developed RFPs and advertisements for those very positions.

03:37:26.360 --> 03:37:36.106
And they are going to find the most competitive economically and best services to prevent any interruption of services to the school.

03:37:36.786 --> 03:37:38.367
So I want to, this is a yes-no question.

03:37:38.387 --> 03:37:51.919
So what you're telling me is you believe the CEG board has the autonomy to do that type of contracting and remove that contract and those services that currently flow from CEG to global and make a decision independent of that.

03:37:52.400 --> 03:37:54.802
If you mean autonomy from global,

03:37:55.771 --> 03:37:56.892
The answer is yes.

03:37:57.172 --> 03:38:03.734
If you mean autonomy from all regulatory bodies, of course we would work with all the regulatory bodies.

03:38:03.774 --> 03:38:08.977
In other words, if your questions deal with, well, can global put a stop to that, right?

03:38:09.717 --> 03:38:19.321
Then the board, as it has passed its resolutions and is moving forward, has acted and will act completely independent

03:38:19.901 --> 03:38:20.421
of global.

03:38:20.902 --> 03:38:28.406
And while I'm on that, I want to correct two fundamental misstatements about global's authority over CEG.

03:38:28.966 --> 03:38:36.991
Global does not have the ability to elect CEG board members and does not have the ability to dispose of CEG assets.

03:38:37.651 --> 03:38:38.952
I mean, that—

03:38:42.543 --> 03:38:43.464
You just said they did.

03:38:43.484 --> 03:38:46.887
That's why I asked the three questions I began with you said that.

03:38:47.067 --> 03:38:48.969
They said those rights have been misconstrued.

03:38:49.229 --> 03:38:53.453
Corporations Code Section 5056 sets out exactly what member rights are.

03:38:54.093 --> 03:38:59.258
And when it comes to the disposition of assets, the right is actually to approve or disapprove

03:38:59.798 --> 03:39:04.339
the CEG board's decision to dispose of all of its assets, all or substantially all.

03:39:04.619 --> 03:39:13.681
So in the event the CEG board wanted to dispose of all of its assets, that is when and only when global's right as to assets would come into play.

03:39:14.081 --> 03:39:17.062
It is not a broad right to dispose of CEG assets at will.

03:39:17.662 --> 03:39:21.803
And I'm real clear that you can't elect the board members, but you do have the power to remove them.

03:39:23.018 --> 03:39:23.959
Well, it's not us.

03:39:23.999 --> 03:39:24.520
Yes or no.

03:39:24.580 --> 03:39:24.960
You do.

03:39:25.120 --> 03:39:26.902
Global does have the power to remove them.

03:39:27.083 --> 03:39:28.004
Global has.

03:39:28.204 --> 03:39:29.085
Yes or no.

03:39:29.525 --> 03:39:29.786
Yes.

03:39:30.126 --> 03:39:30.547
Thank you.

03:39:31.127 --> 03:39:32.168
It has never happened.

03:39:32.188 --> 03:39:34.611
The board has acted completely independently.

03:39:34.691 --> 03:39:37.254
I understand it's never happened, which is why I asked the question.

03:39:37.635 --> 03:39:39.737
Would they be willing to nullify that authority?

03:39:39.777 --> 03:39:40.458
And you said yes.

03:39:40.638 --> 03:39:44.740
And it's the same rights that the other charter schools around the state who have sole members.

03:39:44.820 --> 03:39:46.460
It's the same rights that those members have.

03:39:46.620 --> 03:39:50.422
And it's not because these rights were crafted by the entities to give power.

03:39:50.482 --> 03:39:51.342
I understand.

03:39:51.362 --> 03:39:53.003
I understand.

03:39:53.083 --> 03:39:53.483
Thank you.

03:39:53.763 --> 03:39:54.584
Thank you very much.

03:39:56.584 --> 03:39:57.405
Board member Williams.

03:40:03.367 --> 03:40:05.128
My question is for the L.A.

03:40:05.348 --> 03:40:05.528
team.

03:40:21.329 --> 03:40:36.499
While we're on the subject of organizational structures, I'm curious about how common it is for a school district's OIG to conduct audits and investigations of its charter schools.

03:40:37.399 --> 03:40:43.423
And what is the relationship of the OIG to the charter division within LA Unified?

03:40:43.463 --> 03:40:46.225
How would that those relationships flow?

03:40:50.652 --> 03:41:03.219
my understanding of an OIG and correct me if I'm wrong because I'm not a, you know, a master of this, but they were more like internal affairs to conduct audits and investigations and inquiries internally in an organization.

03:41:05.748 --> 03:41:11.232
The statute regulating the OIG's existence is actually very specific to LAUSD.

03:41:11.732 --> 03:41:20.959
So respectfully, I cannot answer how common it is for other school districts to use an Inspector General's office for the purposes of an audit.

03:41:21.680 --> 03:41:34.249
The Inspector General's office has broad range of authority within the operations of LAUSD, including investigating and auditing our third party contracts and our

03:41:35.610 --> 03:41:46.075
policy including the district required language that's contained in every charter petition indicates that they are subject to OIG audits and investigation.

03:41:46.395 --> 03:41:54.439
So it's very transparent and it's, the OIG has conducted investigations and audits on charter schools in the district.

03:41:54.579 --> 03:41:55.500
Not just Hilarity.

03:41:55.940 --> 03:41:57.881
You said the statute, state statute?

03:41:59.061 --> 03:42:04.624
Yes, the California Education Code has a statute on the LAUCD Inspector General's Office.

03:42:06.529 --> 03:42:07.751
And just a little bit of follow up.

03:42:08.291 --> 03:42:19.082
How long have, when did, have you all, has LAUSD, as long as you know, how long have they used the OIG for charter reviews and inquiries and investigations?

03:42:19.162 --> 03:42:22.666
Is that relatively recently or is it decades or?

03:42:24.278 --> 03:42:26.241
I can only speak from my experience.

03:42:26.862 --> 03:42:36.498
I have been assisting the Charter Schools Division for approximately eight years and through that the OIG has assisted in audits and investigations.

03:42:37.405 --> 03:42:38.707
Board member Williams also.

03:42:42.392 --> 03:42:55.147
We do our oversight first and when things rise to a certain level in the specific instance, and we've shared this with you guys before, we got credit card statements that were redacted.

03:42:56.147 --> 03:43:00.529
And that's what really began to raise the radar.

03:43:01.090 --> 03:43:02.951
And we began to dig into it.

03:43:02.991 --> 03:43:06.773
And we have forensic level accounting people on our team.

03:43:07.193 --> 03:43:08.474
They begin to dig into it.

03:43:08.574 --> 03:43:21.461
And when they reach a place that we feel like this is beyond the scope of oversight, then we may speak to the, we work through our Office of the General Counsel and we may speak to the IG.

03:43:22.239 --> 03:43:37.374
Okay, and one last question related to this, and that is, and again, correct me if I'm wrong, I might have misinformation here, but isn't the OIG's work, its investigations, its inquiries, confidential?

03:43:38.484 --> 03:43:43.667
Yes, investigations or confidential audits are eventually made public.

03:43:44.528 --> 03:43:44.868
Okay.

03:43:45.348 --> 03:43:59.477
So during an investigation, then if it was an investigation of a charter school, whatever, about whatever operations or anything else, they would not be privy to what was being looked at or asked or charged or alleged or?

03:43:59.877 --> 03:44:00.377
Or wouldn't.

03:44:01.398 --> 03:44:02.078
That's what I'm asking.

03:44:02.338 --> 03:44:02.539
Yeah.

03:44:04.059 --> 03:44:04.320
Okay.

03:44:04.400 --> 03:44:04.780
Thank you.

03:44:08.100 --> 03:44:08.961
Board Member Holliday.

03:44:09.281 --> 03:44:12.804
I was trying to go back over some of the ACCS notes that I took.

03:44:14.685 --> 03:44:21.290
I think you were asked about whether or not you were concerned about any form of nepotism in this organization.

03:44:21.310 --> 03:44:24.233
And I can't remember the answer.

03:44:24.293 --> 03:44:25.293
I apologize, but.

03:44:28.116 --> 03:44:31.258
I don't recall nepotism from the ACCS meeting.

03:44:31.318 --> 03:44:33.380
I do recall the mentioning of conflicts.

03:44:34.401 --> 03:44:38.543
with overlapping of board members or officers and the related entities of Solarity.

03:44:39.804 --> 03:44:40.824
Can you explain that please?

03:44:41.064 --> 03:44:41.324
Sure.

03:44:42.485 --> 03:44:50.729
Like I mentioned earlier on when I was up at the podium is that, you know, the former CEO of Solarity Educational Group.

03:44:51.869 --> 03:44:59.351
She's now the current CEO of Celerity Global Development, the sole statutory member, as well as a vendor of CEG.

03:44:59.812 --> 03:45:02.993
She's also a board member of Global.

03:45:03.393 --> 03:45:12.176
She's also the CEO of Celerity Development LLC, Celerity Contracting Services, and Attenture, as far as we know.

03:45:12.676 --> 03:45:13.676
Could there be other entities?

03:45:14.056 --> 03:45:14.296
Sure.

03:45:15.437 --> 03:45:17.417
But those are some of the overlap.

03:45:17.737 --> 03:45:18.318
Okay, thanks.

03:45:21.525 --> 03:45:29.569
Is it your understanding that CEG uses Global for financial back office services?

03:45:30.170 --> 03:45:35.273
Yes, so we're aware currently, we're aware of two service agreements that CEG has with Global.

03:45:35.653 --> 03:45:40.395
And that is a limited services agreement and a miscellaneous services agreement.

03:45:42.257 --> 03:45:44.858
Both contracts state in there a per-pupil fee.

03:45:45.638 --> 03:45:47.099
One, I believe, has a pupil fee of $799 per pupil.

03:45:50.481 --> 03:45:51.641
for limited services.

03:45:52.161 --> 03:46:00.683
The miscellaneous services contract charges $649 per pupil, which includes back office services, such as budgeting, financial support.

03:46:00.703 --> 03:46:00.963
Yeah.

03:46:01.444 --> 03:46:11.646
At the ACCS meeting, though, I believe someone from CEG indicated that Global actually subcontracts out the back office work.

03:46:12.327 --> 03:46:22.633
So that was something that was very puzzling to me as well when I was looking over this is that Solarity Educational Group utilizes Solarity Global for back office services.

03:46:23.373 --> 03:46:31.417
Solarity Global then has a contract with CSMC as a back office provider for their services as well.

03:46:31.517 --> 03:46:36.040
So that's all I can say with regards to that.

03:46:37.253 --> 03:46:41.456
And CSMC is also headed by the same person?

03:46:42.437 --> 03:46:42.637
No.

03:46:43.037 --> 03:46:43.357
Okay.

03:46:47.200 --> 03:46:48.481
Who is CSMC?

03:46:50.282 --> 03:46:51.323
You use these acronyms.

03:46:51.363 --> 03:46:51.843
I'm sorry.

03:46:51.883 --> 03:46:52.144
I don't.

03:46:52.184 --> 03:46:52.384
Yeah.

03:46:52.424 --> 03:46:52.904
Well, I don't.

03:46:53.244 --> 03:46:55.546
I think I got the logic of it though.

03:46:56.807 --> 03:46:57.067
Yeah.

03:46:57.367 --> 03:46:58.188
Let's stick with that.

03:46:58.248 --> 03:46:58.928
Yeah.

03:47:00.169 --> 03:47:00.630
One of the.

03:47:01.630 --> 03:47:01.810
Okay.

03:47:02.031 --> 03:47:02.271
One of the.

03:47:03.377 --> 03:47:22.109
moments at the ACCS meeting that some of the commissioners were thinking about discussing was the fact that there is evidently a contract between Solarity Education Group and Global for back office services.

03:47:22.859 --> 03:47:28.283
But at the same time, Global subcontracts out the back office services to this other organization.

03:47:28.463 --> 03:47:35.128
That other organization, as far as we know, has no connection, no intertwining with any of these others.

03:47:35.488 --> 03:47:38.590
They're just a back office provider that they hire.

03:47:38.610 --> 03:47:42.053
All right, who's next?

03:47:42.113 --> 03:47:42.413
Yeah.

03:47:43.274 --> 03:47:43.814
Bruce is next.

03:47:44.215 --> 03:47:44.795
Is that it?

03:47:44.855 --> 03:47:45.215
No more?

03:47:45.415 --> 03:47:46.236
No, that was it.

03:47:46.256 --> 03:47:46.436
Okay.

03:47:48.478 --> 03:47:48.718
Next.

03:47:49.138 --> 03:47:49.718
There's no one else.

03:47:49.879 --> 03:47:50.359
I just have one.

03:47:50.419 --> 03:47:51.340
I have another question.

03:47:52.831 --> 03:47:53.257
Just to...

03:47:55.649 --> 03:47:58.331
try to understand the interweavings of all of this.

03:47:58.431 --> 03:48:04.095
The attention, and maybe this is a question for Cindy or Nick, so feel free, I don't either.

03:48:06.197 --> 03:48:16.324
One of the organizations that's described in our item, and this is on page, I don't know the page number, but it's under the affiliates and related contracts is Attenture.

03:48:17.545 --> 03:48:19.487
Interestingly close to Accenture.

03:48:21.288 --> 03:48:24.811
And that it's a technology support organization

03:48:26.647 --> 03:48:32.211
And its member and manager is an entity called the Roane Group, R-O-N-E.

03:48:32.311 --> 03:48:43.599
And it says the Roane Group is a tax blocker corporation owned by Global in order to protect Global's tax-exempt status.

03:48:46.861 --> 03:48:50.704
What is a tax blocker organization, for gosh sakes?

03:48:55.069 --> 03:48:55.830
Yeah.

03:48:57.192 --> 03:48:57.653
Go ahead.

03:49:01.019 --> 03:49:03.543
Yeah, right.

03:49:03.623 --> 03:49:04.886
Yeah, how do we get these?

03:49:04.966 --> 03:49:05.166
Right.

03:49:07.978 --> 03:49:14.341
So, I think probably, you know, Solarity Council is probably better to answer this question anyway.

03:49:14.421 --> 03:49:20.584
But I believe Accenture is a, or has been represented to us by Solarity.

03:49:21.444 --> 03:49:22.525
Accenture, sorry.

03:49:23.125 --> 03:49:35.831
As represented to us, Accenture, because it provides software and IT services, federal tax law,

03:49:37.752 --> 03:49:42.536
tends to view that as a more of a for-profit sort of activity.

03:49:42.916 --> 03:49:47.360
So they can't establish it as a non-profit.

03:49:47.700 --> 03:49:51.984
They can't see, because global is a non-profit, global can't do it.

03:49:52.064 --> 03:49:56.467
So they got to create this other organization and set up as a for-profit to do it.

03:49:57.068 --> 03:50:02.972
And I believe there's a middle, an organization in between global and this,

03:50:05.094 --> 03:50:06.635
you know, for-profit entity.

03:50:06.975 --> 03:50:16.800
Now, they've represented to us that, yes, it's a for-profit entity, but all the profits go because Global is the member of that or the

03:50:17.182 --> 03:50:24.086
the shareholder, the only shareholder of that entity, all the profits would go back to the benefit of global.

03:50:24.166 --> 03:50:26.727
So that's how they've explained it to us.

03:50:26.787 --> 03:50:36.472
But the actual workings of this sort of tax blocker, I think, you know, someone more expertise in tax law would need to address that.

03:50:37.472 --> 03:50:45.978
So I mean, I'd sort of like to know on an intellectual level, but I don't think for purposes of this conversation, I need to have the specifics.

03:50:46.058 --> 03:50:50.941
But I just want to say how troubled I am by all of this information.

03:50:51.121 --> 03:50:56.204
And I didn't have the benefit of talking or attending the ACCS meeting, but

03:50:57.125 --> 03:51:09.897
When I read the ACCS recommendation, which I tend to take with a lot of consideration in making my decisions, the ACCS is an entity that wants to do what's right by charters.

03:51:10.397 --> 03:51:12.799
And we see that in almost all their recommendations.

03:51:13.139 --> 03:51:23.329
When I read their recommendations, they were a very tortured body in trying to come to a conclusion about this charter petition, which says to me we have a major problem here.

03:51:24.460 --> 03:51:34.345
And so I, you know, as one of the strongest charter supporters on this board, I am very, very troubled by where we've ended up with this organization.

03:51:34.425 --> 03:51:38.106
We had a very, you know, robust conversation about it in November.

03:51:38.767 --> 03:51:43.889
But additional information has come to light that gives me even greater pause about this.

03:51:44.849 --> 03:51:46.270
And while I appreciate

03:51:47.837 --> 03:51:52.706
how hard the department has worked to try to figure out how do we go forward with this.

03:51:53.348 --> 03:51:59.960
I just feel like the recommendation sort of asked the board to take a leap of faith that at least for me, I'm not willing to take.

03:52:02.079 --> 03:52:07.585
Okay, that's I think we're heading towards a recommendation by somebody.

03:52:07.905 --> 03:52:09.727
And unfortunately that falls to me.

03:52:09.748 --> 03:52:17.736
I sincerely want to thank all the people who traveled so far to come here today to provide testimony.

03:52:17.957 --> 03:52:23.383
And I know that all of the board members have listened very, very carefully to all of your statements.

03:52:24.143 --> 03:52:33.227
It's clear, however, I think that the board has significant concerns about this appeal and that the CDE as well.

03:52:34.287 --> 03:52:52.615
So in order to make a motion that will actually fit charter law and this appeal law, I will simply state that I'm trying to take all of the concerns that I've heard and put it into the phrase of

03:52:53.892 --> 03:53:01.896
a motion that I believe that the petitioners are unlikely to successfully implement the educational program and I move denial of the petition.

03:53:01.916 --> 03:53:04.297
Do you second?

03:53:04.877 --> 03:53:06.638
Yes, with a heavy heart I second.

03:53:07.298 --> 03:53:08.198
I second that motion.

03:53:09.539 --> 03:53:13.641
Okay, let's call the roll on this then if we're ready for the vote.

03:53:17.903 --> 03:53:18.463
Bruce Holliday.

03:53:20.162 --> 03:53:20.342
Okay.

03:53:20.822 --> 03:53:21.463
Nikki Sandoval.

03:53:21.483 --> 03:53:21.563
Yes.

03:53:22.863 --> 03:53:23.444
Karen Valdez.

03:53:23.464 --> 03:53:23.584
Yes.

03:53:25.065 --> 03:53:25.865
Olivia Sison.

03:53:25.885 --> 03:53:25.965
Yes.

03:53:27.046 --> 03:53:27.666
Trish Williams.

03:53:28.206 --> 03:53:28.407
Yes.

03:53:29.847 --> 03:53:30.388
Mike Kirst.

03:53:30.628 --> 03:53:30.928
Yes.

03:53:31.448 --> 03:53:32.069
Elaine Strauss.

03:53:32.089 --> 03:53:32.169
Yes.

03:53:32.969 --> 03:53:33.469
Sue Burr.

03:53:33.669 --> 03:53:33.850
Yes.

03:53:34.550 --> 03:53:35.951
Felicia Ortiz-Lujan.

03:53:35.971 --> 03:53:36.051
Yes.

03:53:37.271 --> 03:53:37.972
Patricia Rucker.

03:53:38.232 --> 03:53:38.472
Yes.

03:53:38.872 --> 03:53:39.112
Okay.

03:53:39.132 --> 03:53:39.953
It was unanimous.

03:53:40.350 --> 03:53:40.530
Okay.

03:53:41.250 --> 03:53:41.550
All right.

03:53:41.570 --> 03:53:44.131
That charter petition is denied.

03:53:44.151 --> 03:53:44.231
Okay.

03:53:45.151 --> 03:53:54.953
The board will reconvene and we're now ready for item 18, the Oxford Preparatory Academic.

03:53:54.973 --> 03:53:55.313
19, sorry, 19.

03:53:57.394 --> 03:53:59.134
Oxford Preparatory Academy.

03:54:00.094 --> 03:54:02.155
So Cindy Chan, where?

03:54:54.465 --> 03:55:00.894
So another very difficult item that we'll be probably presenting to you, item 19.

03:55:01.515 --> 03:55:04.840
Again, this is Cindy Chan at the California Department of Education.

03:55:05.589 --> 03:55:10.591
Item 19 is the third of four renewals that you're going to be hearing today.

03:55:10.611 --> 03:55:25.298
It's an appeal by Oxford Preparatory Academy, Chino Valley to renew the charter school, which was denied by the Chino Valley Unified School District and not considered by the San Bernardino County Board of Education.

03:55:27.116 --> 03:55:37.020
The CDE received the OPA Charter Appeal on January 31st based on a review of the petition documents and information submitted.

03:55:38.261 --> 03:55:51.706
We are recommending that the State Board hold a public hearing and thereafter deny the request to renew OPA Charter under the oversight of the State Board for a five-year term effective July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2022 based on the CDE's findings.

03:55:56.229 --> 03:56:11.448
that the petitioners are not likely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition because of the petitioner's history of fiscal mismanagement, that OPA charter has presented an unrealistic operational plan,

03:56:13.031 --> 03:56:26.669
And the OPA charter budget cannot be deemed viable due to the potential of undiscovered contracts, transactions, extended liabilities, loans, and obligations, and the lack of valid audit reports.

03:56:28.720 --> 03:56:33.902
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools considered the OPA charter petition at its April 5th meeting.

03:56:34.582 --> 03:56:55.868
The ACCS moved a recommendation that the State Board approve the renewal of OPA charter contingent upon the charter school engaging with and maintaining an ongoing relationship with a third-party fiscal services organization such as the Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team or FCMAT.

03:56:56.768 --> 03:57:04.756
or an entity recommended by school services to ensure that all FCMAT audit findings and other concerns are resolved.

03:57:05.977 --> 03:57:11.342
Five votes are required to move an ACCS recommendation forward to the State Board.

03:57:11.362 --> 03:57:14.565
The motion did not pass by a vote of four to three.

03:57:15.045 --> 03:57:18.749
Therefore, there is no ACCS formal recommendation before you.

03:57:21.275 --> 03:57:26.479
OPA Charter currently operates a transitional kindergarten through grade eight school.

03:57:27.100 --> 03:57:40.531
The mission of the charter school is to work collaboratively to develop lifelong learners in a safe and caring educational environment where pupils are challenged, scholarship is expected, and differences are valued.

03:57:42.132 --> 03:57:49.298
OPA Charter's program is specifically designed to prepare pupils to enter competitive colleges and universities worldwide.

03:57:50.319 --> 03:58:01.888
The petitioners proposed to serve 1,226 pupils in transitional kindergarten through grade eight in all five years of its renewal term, 2017-18 through 2021-22.

03:58:01.908 --> 03:58:10.295
So I'll kind of briefly walk through the first set of criteria for renewal, which is academic achievement.

03:58:11.856 --> 03:58:20.559
Again, the charter authorizer shall consider increases in people academic achievement for all groups of pupils served by the charter school as the most important factor for renewal.

03:58:22.360 --> 03:58:33.004
In using these standard criteria for renewal, the charter school has to meet at least one of these five criteria related to academic performance, which again is mainly the academic performance index.

03:58:33.584 --> 03:58:35.345
They're described on page four of your item.

03:58:36.445 --> 03:58:45.871
In detail, we find that OPA charter has met four of the five criteria and has thus demonstrated increases in people academic achievement.

03:58:47.492 --> 03:59:06.065
We also considered alternative measures that were presented for OPA charters pupil academic achievement and that's pursuant to statute that says alternative measures that show increases in people academic achievement for all groups of pupils schoolwide and among significant subgroups.

03:59:06.645 --> 03:59:16.509
So we reviewed their academic data and found that they met and exceeded for four significant subgroups for 2012-13.

03:59:17.610 --> 03:59:32.576
They met their target and that they improved 89% of their pupils maintained or improved their proficiency level from the interim to the summative assessment of the 2015 administration of the CASP, the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress.

03:59:33.456 --> 03:59:41.965
So to sum up, because OPA charter met the standard criteria for renewal, an analysis of alternative measures was unnecessary.

03:59:42.065 --> 03:59:48.612
Nevertheless, we did look at more recent data due to the fact that the API data is a little outdated.

03:59:49.713 --> 03:59:53.998
So then moving forward and looking into the petition and the multiple required elements.

03:59:56.174 --> 04:00:02.920
We performed the independent review of the renewal petition and all the documents that were submitted to the school district.

04:00:03.800 --> 04:00:24.117
Again, in terms of what we're looking for, and that could form a basis for a finding of denial, we looked at the petition, determined whether it met the criteria of presenting a sound educational program, that the petition contains reasonably comprehensive descriptions of the required elements,

04:00:24.777 --> 04:00:29.678
and whether the petitioners are able to successfully implement the intended program.

04:00:31.419 --> 04:00:46.623
Based on a review of the petition documents, we find that the educational program is adequately described and that the elements were sufficiently met, noting that there were some we identified as needing a technical amendment.

04:00:47.782 --> 04:01:06.901
I want to point out, while we found no issues in the petition with the charter school's community outreach plan to reach racial and ethnic balance, at the ACCS meeting commissioners had expressed concern that the charter school does not participate in the frame reduced price meal program.

04:01:08.462 --> 04:01:22.458
In looking at the data, we are also concerned that the decision not to participate in the program has likely been a significant factor in the disparity of socioeconomic levels that exist in the district and the charter school.

04:01:22.978 --> 04:01:27.864
In looking at the data that the CDE has on their public website,

04:01:29.225 --> 04:01:35.751
The district's percentage of students eligible for free and reduced price lunch is double to that of the charter school.

04:01:35.771 --> 04:01:39.354
The charter school is at 22% roughly and the district at 43%.

04:01:39.454 --> 04:01:46.961
So that was a discussion at ACCS and we went back and looked at the data in support of that.

04:01:49.096 --> 04:01:55.244
So I'm going to focus more on the one area of finding the petitioner's ability to successfully implement the program.

04:01:57.247 --> 04:02:03.295
For this particular criterion includes a number of factors and one of them is the financial plan.

04:02:04.897 --> 04:02:10.821
We looked at the budget and all the financial statements that were provided.

04:02:11.481 --> 04:02:28.113
And although they have projected positive ending fund balances in its multi-year budget for fiscal years 2017-18 through 2019-20, we have concerns about the fiscal operation of the charter school based on the FCMAT audit findings.

04:02:29.195 --> 04:02:34.435
based on a notice of violation issued by a district of one of their other schools, which is

04:02:38.607 --> 04:02:44.011
and also findings noted in the fiscal year 2015-16 independent audit report.

04:02:45.572 --> 04:02:50.635
Another very critical factor of this criteria is the capacity of the petitioner.

04:02:50.675 --> 04:02:57.840
And as you can tell, even with the last items that we had reviewed, this is a more difficult one.

04:02:57.920 --> 04:03:04.264
I mean, when we look at the educational program and the elements in the charter, we have the documents in front of us.

04:03:04.364 --> 04:03:07.987
So we're looking through paper, we're looking at the vision, at the plan.

04:03:08.707 --> 04:03:10.668
Capacity requires a little bit more than that.

04:03:10.708 --> 04:03:13.830
We have to also look at what's not in the charter petition.

04:03:13.930 --> 04:03:28.680
We have to look at what the petitioner is bringing to the charter school and whether they have the capacity to implement that program and ensure that that school is going to be viable for the full term, in this case would be for five years.

04:03:30.181 --> 04:03:39.529
So that takes us to one of the pieces of evidence that we looked at in terms of trying to determine whether they could meet this factor.

04:03:39.649 --> 04:03:42.692
And it was the FCMAT Extraordinary Audit Report.

04:03:42.712 --> 04:03:45.094
So I'm gonna go into quite a bit of detail on this one.

04:03:45.114 --> 04:03:49.678
The audit report's quite long, so I'm not sure if you've read it, but I'll hit the kind of major pieces.

04:03:50.339 --> 04:03:53.742
The background of the audit, and then the scope, and then the findings.

04:03:55.543 --> 04:04:13.716
Pursuant to Education Code Section 1241.5c, a county superintendent may review or audit the expenditures and internal controls of any charter school in the county if there is reason to believe that fraud, misappropriation of funds, or other illegal practices have occurred that merit examination.

04:04:14.657 --> 04:04:15.118
On November 23rd, 2015,

04:04:18.020 --> 04:04:31.954
The, excuse me, the district superintendent expressed concerns in a letter to the San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools regarding allegations of conflict of interest and self-dealing by Oxford Preparatory Academy.

04:04:32.114 --> 04:04:36.339
So this is the, would be the CMO of the charter even though they have a similar name.

04:04:36.359 --> 04:04:37.920
So I'll just refer to that as OPA.

04:04:38.961 --> 04:04:51.294
The allegations included multiple fiscal irregularities, questionable expenditures, and inappropriate related party transactions at the charter school based on a preliminary investigation conducted by the district.

04:04:52.515 --> 04:04:59.262
Due to concerns that the allegations may have violated various statutes related to fraud and or misappropriation of assets,

04:04:59.662 --> 04:05:11.651
the county superintendent initiated an investigation to determine whether sufficient evidence of criminal activity exists to report the matter to the local district attorney's office for further investigation.

04:05:12.711 --> 04:05:21.798
In July 2016, the office of the county superintendent entered into a contract with FCMAT to perform an assembly bill 139 extraordinary audit

04:05:23.759 --> 04:05:32.224
of OPA's charter regarding the alleged fraud, misappropriation of funds, and possible illegal activity in the OPA organization.

04:05:33.965 --> 04:05:41.690
FCMAT began fieldwork in August 2016, which included interviews, data collection, and documentation review.

04:05:42.270 --> 04:05:49.774
They performed interviews that were conducted with county and district staff and the OPA charter executive director and executive team.

04:05:51.255 --> 04:06:01.004
meetings were conducted with business office staff, current and former charter school employees, the charter school's back office provider, and the charter school's independent auditor.

04:06:01.985 --> 04:06:12.215
FCMAT also reviewed, analyzed, and tested records that included but were not limited to audited financial statements, financial records, support documentation, board minutes,

04:06:12.675 --> 04:06:21.892
memorandums of understanding, emails, contracts, payroll records, and other documentation from independent third-party and governmental sources.

04:06:23.436 --> 04:06:47.245
FCMAT also identified the following OPA organizational entities, affiliated organizations, and executive staff that include, but not limited to, OPA, a non-profit public benefit corporation formed to manage and operate the two charter schools, OPA Chino Valley and OPA South Orange County, which is authorized by Capistrano Unified School District.

04:06:48.585 --> 04:06:57.770
OPA Schools, a non-profit public benefit corporation formed in 2013 as the charter management organization over OPA.

04:06:59.110 --> 04:07:07.234
OPA Alliance, OPA Schools was renamed OPA Alliance and Enlighten Learning Solutions.

04:07:07.494 --> 04:07:14.077
OPA Alliance was renamed Enlighten, the CMO and sole statutory member of OPA.

04:07:15.538 --> 04:07:24.103
Epic Youth Services, limited liability company, a for-profit company that provided financial and consulting services to Enlighten.

04:07:25.204 --> 04:07:36.291
Educational Excellence, LLC, a for-profit limited liability company that provided services to Enlighten, whose founder is Brian Roche, Sue Roche's son.

04:07:37.011 --> 04:07:38.312
And Sue Roche, former

04:07:38.852 --> 04:07:46.602
founder of OPA, former chief executive officer and former executive director of OPA and Enlighten.

04:07:47.383 --> 04:07:53.291
And Barbara Black, CEO and executive director of OPA, who resigned effective December 6, 2016.

04:07:55.965 --> 04:08:01.628
So the audit report is lengthy and it contains a lot of audit findings.

04:08:01.668 --> 04:08:06.211
I'm going to kind of just mention the probably the more significant ones.

04:08:07.911 --> 04:08:14.595
So as a result of the fieldwork completed, FCMAT's final audit report identified findings that include the following.

04:08:14.655 --> 04:08:15.996
So this is not all inclusive.

04:08:17.056 --> 04:08:34.989
Occupational fraud, the lack of internal controls at OPA, and relationships between the founder, relatives, and close associates, and the founder's other nonprofit public and private corporations created an environment that made it possible for fraud to occur, including motivation and opportunity.

04:08:36.190 --> 04:08:37.190
Conflict of interest.

04:08:37.790 --> 04:08:50.993
Conflict of interest exists at OPA with charter officials participating in the decision-making process and exercising considerable influence that had major financial implications without full disclosure to the governing board.

04:08:52.034 --> 04:09:02.436
Multiple transactions involve self-dealing with the founder's nonprofit public benefits and for-profit corporations that allowed the founder, relatives, and close associates

04:09:03.036 --> 04:09:15.343
To gain financially from these decisions and contracts, these individuals participate in subsequent actions to contracts, including signatory authority and approval of payments on behalf of the charter schools.

04:09:17.004 --> 04:09:18.885
California Corporations Code Section 5233.

04:09:20.826 --> 04:09:38.992
Affiliated and related party relationship exists between the founder of OPA and her nonprofit, Public Benefit Corporations, and for-profit corporations that provided services through a daisy chain of companies evidenced by contracts, master agreements, and consulting arrangements.

04:09:40.052 --> 04:09:56.200
The founder, several relatives, and close associates exercised significant personal involvement and financial interests violating conflict of interest statutes, the memorandum of understanding between the charter school and the school district, as well as their own board policies.

04:09:58.283 --> 04:10:01.745
related party transactions significant influence in self-dealing.

04:10:02.445 --> 04:10:22.255
The founder created a complex structure of charter management corporations that exercise significant influence over transactions and contracts between these entities and secured considerable financial benefit through contracts that charge management service fees up to 10% funneling funding from the OPA charter schools.

04:10:23.536 --> 04:10:43.136
Affiliated and or related party organizations were intentionally created to divert and launder funds from OPA and conceal the use of these funds from the oversight agency, Chino Valley Unified School District, the OPA independent auditor, and all others that relied on the financial statements and independent financial audits.

04:10:44.557 --> 04:10:53.461
Presenting the affiliated entities and related parties as simply vendors circumvented the district's agreements contained in the charter petition and MOU.

04:10:54.881 --> 04:11:12.708
OPA management intentionally hid the related parties by failing to disclose in management representation letters to the auditors and the district, concealing the true nature of related party relationships and misleading independent auditors to file incorrect financial statements and audit reports.

04:11:14.469 --> 04:11:16.029
Enlighten Learning Solutions.

04:11:16.430 --> 04:11:23.653
Enlighten declined to cooperate and make its financial records or access to personnel available for purposes of the FCMAT audit.

04:11:23.673 --> 04:11:24.893
So that is still pending.

04:11:26.034 --> 04:11:39.961
Pursuant to OPA's amended bylaws, Enlighten as both the CMO and sole statutory member of OPA has broad legal power and ultimate control to remove any director with or without cause within the OPA organization.

04:11:41.261 --> 04:11:48.783
Ed Leighton has a material economic interest in OPA, which OPA pays substantial CMO management fees to Ed Leighton.

04:11:49.404 --> 04:11:59.006
From January 2013 through June 2016, OPA charter schools paid management fees of $4.3 million to Ed Leighton.

04:11:59.647 --> 04:12:02.988
Of this total, OPA charter paid $2.4 million.

04:12:05.330 --> 04:12:09.814
Enlighten's only source of income are fees mainly from OPA.

04:12:10.375 --> 04:12:21.886
Enlighten uses OPA and its status as a CMO to move money from a public charter school, asserting that the CMO expenditures are not required to be part of the FCMAT audit.

04:12:23.087 --> 04:12:29.374
Employees are leased between OPA and Enlighten as part of a master agreement for personnel services.

04:12:30.455 --> 04:12:45.030
And then lastly, the Academies of Oxford Prep accounting record identified records identified loans totaling $376,000 from Enlighten to this organization using fees collected from OPA schools.

04:12:48.243 --> 04:12:49.324
Gift of public funds.

04:12:49.584 --> 04:13:02.931
FCMAT found several examples where expenditures for Enlighten health premiums, equipment leases, travel costs and other payments were paid with OPA's school funds, invoiced to the CMO and subsequently reimbursed.

04:13:03.532 --> 04:13:10.556
These payments made on behalf of Enlighten are prohibited by the California Constitution as a gift of public funds.

04:13:20.174 --> 04:13:34.084
Related party organizations were intentionally created to divert and launder funds from OPA and conceal the use of the funds from the district, the independent auditor and others that relied on the statements and independent financial audits.

04:13:34.845 --> 04:13:47.975
The final FCMAT extraordinary audit report dated November 22, 2016 concludes that OPA charter may have engaged in fraud, misappropriation of assets or other illegal activities.

04:13:48.995 --> 04:13:51.196
So other issues that we found were significant.

04:13:51.236 --> 04:13:55.697
There have been notices of violation as a result of the FCMAT audit.

04:13:56.837 --> 04:14:08.840
The district issued a notice of violation to OPA Charter on January 10th, 2017 stating that the district finds the violations identified in the FCMAT report are of substantial concern.

04:14:09.900 --> 04:14:19.404
The district provided the charter school with the opportunity to submit a plan of definitive action by January 31st that would correct violations and prevent future violations.

04:14:20.544 --> 04:14:24.646
The charter school submitted a response in writing to the district on January 31st.

04:14:25.286 --> 04:14:32.028
Additionally, the other district, Capistrano, issued a notice of violation to OPA

04:14:34.449 --> 04:14:45.516
I can't remember the acronym, to their charter school LPASOC on December 15th and that the district finds that the violations identified in the FCMAT report of substantial concern.

04:14:46.437 --> 04:14:53.961
That district also provided the opportunity to submit a plan of definitive action from the charter school by January 2nd that would correct the violations.

04:14:55.783 --> 04:14:57.565
Significant issues that are pending.

04:14:57.585 --> 04:15:03.532
Accrediting Commission for Schools, Western Association of Schools and Colleges.

04:15:03.632 --> 04:15:12.722
On February 1st, 2017, WASC issued a letter to OPA charter regarding the potential withholding of accreditation status.

04:15:13.463 --> 04:15:18.791
The city received a copy of this letter via email on April 7th from the district.

04:15:19.031 --> 04:15:28.444
The letter states that the charter school violated WASC policies around substantive changes, integrity of member schools, and disclosure information.

04:15:29.365 --> 04:15:36.773
WASC offered the Charter School an opportunity to respond with reasons why accreditation should not be withheld by March 15th.

04:15:37.654 --> 04:15:43.861
WASC reported to the CDE during a phone conversation that the Charter School did submit a response to the letter.

04:15:45.402 --> 04:15:52.405
The letter responds to each of the violations identified in the letter and provides some additional documentation in support of their response.

04:15:52.925 --> 04:15:59.467
WASC informed the charter school that it will postpone their decision until their June 26th, 27th meeting in the summer.

04:16:02.448 --> 04:16:05.951
Another pending issue is Enlighten Learning Solutions.

04:16:06.292 --> 04:16:16.900
Enlighten refused to provide financial and personal records to FCMAT even though there is clear evidence that Enlighten and OPA are affiliated and related parties.

04:16:17.461 --> 04:16:25.808
This failure to disclose information prevents FCMAT from presenting all of the evidence of it related to OPA's fiscal practices.

04:16:26.568 --> 04:16:43.322
Based on the information available, FCMAT identified again that management fees roughly $4.3 million plus another $450,000 from loans and rent bring the total revenues of $4.7 million to Edlighton from OPA.

04:16:43.342 --> 04:16:49.908
FCMAT estimates that Edlighton has roughly $570,000 cash on hand as of June 30th, 2016 that should be returned to OPA.

04:16:57.794 --> 04:16:58.955
Annual financial audits.

04:16:59.295 --> 04:17:15.963
So FCMEC stated that the audited financial statements from 2012-13 through 2014-15 were misstated due to the fact that the charter school failed to disclose the complete, transparent, and true nature of the relationship between the charter school and Enlighten.

04:17:16.743 --> 04:17:21.287
and recommended that the audited financial statements should be reissued with proper disclosure.

04:17:22.228 --> 04:17:30.475
However, FCMAT notes that the auditor would not be able to consolidate financial statements since Enlighten has refused to make financial records available.

04:17:31.856 --> 04:17:45.065
Furthermore, the independent audit for the most recent period ending June 30th, 2016 included a significant internal control finding related to financial reporting of related parties and conflicts of interest.

04:17:45.705 --> 04:18:01.196
The audit finding states that OPA management concealed the use of $900,000 of unexpended funds from the auditors, governing board, the charter authorizer, and the state for purposes of conflict of interest and full disclosure reporting requirements.

04:18:02.438 --> 04:18:10.851
At the April 5th meeting, ACCS meeting, OPA was asked about the status of Enlighten making financial records available for the audit.

04:18:10.912 --> 04:18:14.598
However, the representatives were unable to confirm that.

04:18:16.417 --> 04:18:45.280
And then lastly, the San Bernardino District Attorney investigation, again, pursuant to Education Code Section 47638 sub B, the San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools shall notify the local district attorney if there's evidence that fraud or misappropriation of assets has occurred as our understanding that the FCMAT audit findings were provided and are communicated to the San Bernardino District Attorney and that the matter is still pending.

04:18:46.982 --> 04:18:59.589
So to summarize, the CDE finds that after review of the FCMAT findings that OPA leadership failed to meet generally accepted accounting principles, engaged in fiscal and engaged in fiscal mismanagement.

04:19:00.209 --> 04:19:14.278
Based on these findings, the CDE has serious concerns about the OPA leadership and Board of Directors ability to successfully implement the program given the history of fiscal mismanagement and lack of internal controls.

04:19:15.138 --> 04:19:30.252
We would like to note that the Charter School has taken steps to address the FCMAT findings as noted in their cover letter to the CDE as well as to information that has been presented to both the ACCS and the State Board.

04:19:30.952 --> 04:20:00.172
However, we find that these steps are insufficient in addressing all of FCMAT's findings since the actions to this to this date that we have found are not supported with a formal report by an independent organization with forensic level expertise and that all of the FCMAT findings have not been addressed and corrective measures and internal controls cannot be validated have been put in place without that independent verification.

04:20:01.373 --> 04:20:14.609
With the level of severity of the fiscal abuse identified by FCMAT, we are skeptical that any corrective action addressing all of the findings could have been put in place and implemented in such a short time frame.

04:20:15.510 --> 04:20:19.355
As such, the department is recommending that the State Board hold a public hearing

04:20:20.015 --> 04:20:35.481
and thereafter deny to renew the OPA charter based on the finding that the petitioner is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition because of the history of the petitioner's fiscal mismanagement.

04:20:36.301 --> 04:20:52.635
They presented an unrealistic operational plan, and the budget cannot be deemed viable due to the potential of undiscovered contracts, transactions, extended liabilities, loans, and obligations, and the lack of valid audit reports for the last couple of years.

04:20:54.236 --> 04:21:03.604
The petitioners, representatives from the district and or the county, and there's a representative from FCMA, in case you have any questions, are here to address the board.

04:21:04.705 --> 04:21:04.965
Thank you.

04:21:06.118 --> 04:21:09.043
Okay, this is the time for technical questions.

04:21:10.245 --> 04:21:11.467
Okay, Board Member Rucker.

04:21:20.054 --> 04:21:27.561
Cindy, all of us have received a letter from OPA related to today's hearing.

04:21:28.101 --> 04:21:34.687
And what I'd like to ask you to do, because a lot of what you talked about is not addressed or reviewed in the letter.

04:21:34.707 --> 04:21:37.349
I'd like to get, I don't know if you've seen this letter.

04:21:37.750 --> 04:21:41.693
It was just delivered to us after, at some point, either just after lunch or during a break.

04:21:42.874 --> 04:21:49.157
So I'd like to give this to you and ask if you could please just review it relative to the stuff that you talked with us about.

04:21:49.477 --> 04:21:55.919
Because I want to make sure that what's presented here is actually addressed in the concerns that you raise.

04:21:55.939 --> 04:21:59.901
Is that okay if I?

04:21:59.921 --> 04:22:00.401
That's okay.

04:22:00.681 --> 04:22:00.821
Yeah.

04:22:01.201 --> 04:22:02.782
I took notes from what she talked about.

04:22:02.802 --> 04:22:05.523
Legal evaluation.

04:22:05.543 --> 04:22:07.344
No, it's not.

04:22:08.638 --> 04:22:10.199
Oh, it's not a legal evaluation.

04:22:10.239 --> 04:22:13.101
It's a four point letter from the attorneys representing OPA.

04:22:13.421 --> 04:22:14.842
It's not a legal evaluation.

04:22:15.182 --> 04:22:16.703
Did we get these two?

04:22:17.183 --> 04:22:17.643
Okay.

04:22:17.703 --> 04:22:22.266
Yeah, it's a four point letter that the attorney sent.

04:22:22.826 --> 04:22:35.013
And while Cindy was making her presentation and going through the findings from FCMAT, one of the statements she made is that the organization agreed to develop a plan of correction

04:22:35.613 --> 04:22:36.455
a plan of action.

04:22:36.495 --> 04:22:38.618
That's not what's enumerated in the letter.

04:22:38.658 --> 04:22:47.952
So I'm confused by what the findings were and the conversations that have happened between the department and FCMAT and this organization and what this letter says.

04:22:48.312 --> 04:22:50.536
So I'd like to ask Cindy to review the letter.

04:22:51.076 --> 04:23:06.463
and to help me understand the difference between what that letter is talking about and the conversation, she says, the organization is having in a genuine effort to try to address or fix and correct what was raised by FCMAT because that's not what I read in the letter.

04:23:07.063 --> 04:23:07.984
I'd like to clarify.

04:23:08.004 --> 04:23:11.925
I don't think that, I'm not sure if that letter is from OPA's attorneys.

04:23:13.566 --> 04:23:15.187
I believe it's from Sue Roach's attorneys.

04:23:16.425 --> 04:23:16.745
Okay.

04:23:17.486 --> 04:23:18.247
It doesn't say that.

04:23:18.868 --> 04:23:19.068
Is it?

04:23:19.409 --> 04:23:20.190
I'll have to clarify.

04:23:20.210 --> 04:23:21.291
It doesn't say who they're representing.

04:23:21.411 --> 04:23:24.315
Well, that's why I gave it to Cindy to ask her to take a look at it.

04:23:24.715 --> 04:23:25.076
I'm all.

04:23:25.196 --> 04:23:26.397
So let's let them look at it.

04:23:26.437 --> 04:23:28.460
But I'm also really leery.

04:23:28.480 --> 04:23:31.263
We had this last time of people walking in with letters.

04:23:31.544 --> 04:23:32.024
I mean, I.

04:23:32.825 --> 04:23:38.591
I thought we, you know, we want to vet this stuff, not have last-minute stuff come in.

04:23:38.731 --> 04:23:42.334
So I'm... It came in the mail today at one o'clock.

04:23:42.754 --> 04:23:45.076
All the other letters that we received are in your Dropbox.

04:23:45.117 --> 04:23:47.118
So there are letters from OPA's attorneys.

04:23:47.619 --> 04:23:57.088
I think we need to set some deadlines on when we will consider something and not have handouts at the last minute that we haven't been able to read or study.

04:23:57.708 --> 04:24:00.572
And asking CDE to read this on the fly.

04:24:00.672 --> 04:24:02.034
I mean, this whole thing.

04:24:02.755 --> 04:24:07.522
So I would request in the future we have some kind of hard and fast deadline and things not be

04:24:09.903 --> 04:24:19.050
At the bottom of the agenda, it says that any, if they don't provide correspondence by noon on Friday before the meeting, then we won't, then they won't make it in the drop box that goes to you.

04:24:19.070 --> 04:24:19.471
But you're right.

04:24:20.011 --> 04:24:25.315
People often bring things to the meeting and who are unfamiliar with our processes and they often bring handouts to the meeting.

04:24:25.736 --> 04:24:26.036
Okay.

04:24:26.496 --> 04:24:27.517
Well, we'll talk about that.

04:24:27.837 --> 04:24:28.658
So I want to.

04:24:28.678 --> 04:24:31.200
Okay, go ahead.

04:24:33.086 --> 04:24:33.386
All right.

04:24:33.727 --> 04:24:39.052
I wanted to have the FCMAT person come up because Mike Fine, is he here?

04:24:42.936 --> 04:24:44.458
No, this is a technical thing.

04:24:44.918 --> 04:24:45.579
I don't think this will...

04:24:49.486 --> 04:24:51.187
I think it's part of what Cindy did.

04:24:51.267 --> 04:25:02.896
So in the pages of your audit 23, you say, because ELS did not cooperate with the FCMAA audit, many questions remain unanswered.

04:25:03.456 --> 04:25:07.179
The following are major discrepancies and you list about 10 of them.

04:25:07.939 --> 04:25:27.508
And then on, for example, I'm just picking out of the audit, because FCMAT's management did not make its books and because ELS management did not make its books and records available to the FCMAT investigation, FCMAT cannot confirm the disposition of the building's equipment and possession of ELS.

04:25:29.109 --> 04:25:30.429
This is throughout there.

04:25:30.549 --> 04:25:33.271
So in order to understand, I think what Cindy said,

04:25:34.911 --> 04:25:36.932
there's still a lot unknown out there.

04:25:37.812 --> 04:25:44.655
And can you talk about that in terms of what, you know, we have an audit report from you.

04:25:44.755 --> 04:25:54.378
It says various things, but there's still this ELS organization, which is, you know, you were unable to obtain lots of things from.

04:25:54.998 --> 04:26:02.661
So I'd like you to discuss that a little bit and then talk about the implications for the audit and its ability to be comprehensive.

04:26:04.158 --> 04:26:13.046
Thank you, Dr. Kearse, members of the board and staff, Michael Fine, Chief Administrative Officer of the state's Fiscal Crisis Management Assistance Team.

04:26:13.666 --> 04:26:23.175
As Cindy outlined very clearly, we were engaged by the San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools to do an Assembly Bill 139 Extraordinary Audit.

04:26:24.215 --> 04:26:32.902
As I think the board's aware, it is the exclusive right of the 58 county superintendents to call for such an audit.

04:26:33.823 --> 04:26:39.247
And we are the agency that generally provides that with

04:26:40.087 --> 04:26:44.911
reimbursement to the local agency so that it's not a financial burden to them.

04:26:45.572 --> 04:26:53.538
In this particular case, reviewing the information that the district provided to the county office and that the county office provided us, we developed a scope.

04:26:53.638 --> 04:26:56.520
And Cindy did a good job of outlining that scope.

04:26:56.540 --> 04:27:01.745
But I think understanding the scope is important, Dr. Kirst, in part to your question.

04:27:02.525 --> 04:27:05.728
There were three main scope points and I want to highlight

04:27:08.490 --> 04:27:09.131
Two of those.

04:27:09.571 --> 04:27:24.207
The first was determined whether the charter school engaged in related party transactions and if those transactions were conducted in accordance with established national and state policies, standards and procedures and were transparent in nature.

04:27:25.008 --> 04:27:31.618
This goes to the district's concern that the charter organizations had not been transparent to them.

04:27:32.119 --> 04:27:38.208
They were learning things on the fly as opposed to how they should learn them through their normal oversight process.

04:27:39.784 --> 04:27:50.792
Subsections of that scope include conduct a review of plant property and equipment ownership and transfers of the charter school and any related party considered consolidatable.

04:27:51.412 --> 04:27:59.558
This gets to account national accounting standards under the Financial Accounting Standards Board and Government Accounting Standards Board regulations.

04:28:00.178 --> 04:28:07.403
And then also as Cindy highlighted to review independent annual audits for the period of time.

04:28:08.644 --> 04:28:21.013
The second major scope point was to determine if expenditures made by the charter school are for legitimate educational purposes in accordance with approved contracts, purchase orders, and memorandum of understandings.

04:28:21.073 --> 04:28:23.434
And Dr. Kirst, that actually is the point

04:28:24.295 --> 04:28:34.204
that not being able to see the detail of expenditures that you highlight on page 23 from ELS is important.

04:28:34.804 --> 04:28:44.292
However, we were, as the report shows, able to obtain a number of documents related to ELS and reach some conclusions.

04:28:44.793 --> 04:28:46.554
What's important on page 23, that list of

04:28:48.636 --> 04:29:02.732
unknowns items actually refer back to page 22, which is a summary of ELS's federal tax return, which was available to us through public sources.

04:29:03.313 --> 04:29:08.899
And you'll see that they filed a return in August of 15 and amended it in June of 16.

04:29:10.160 --> 04:29:14.944
And it was the amendments that we are questioning, the nature of those amendments.

04:29:15.445 --> 04:29:17.867
And it gets to what were the expenditures.

04:29:17.967 --> 04:29:21.950
There are a number of things pointed out as Dr. Kurtz has indicated.

04:29:22.010 --> 04:29:25.153
Fees for service for non-employee, fees for services

04:29:27.754 --> 04:29:42.939
for non-employee management travel and there were allegations with regard to where these funds being paid to individuals that were involved in the governance and management of OPA.

04:29:43.399 --> 04:29:47.041
And so that's where the detail becomes important.

04:29:47.761 --> 04:29:52.262
Was travel being, personal travel being paid for with these funds?

04:29:52.482 --> 04:29:53.443
Was there additional

04:29:55.163 --> 04:30:00.969
fees, stipends, salary, wages, whatever you want to call them, being paid to some of these individuals.

04:30:01.009 --> 04:30:03.452
And that's where those details would have been important.

04:30:05.354 --> 04:30:08.957
In part, we included this in our report really as a

04:30:11.480 --> 04:30:21.288
in some respects as a path, a list of items that would be important for follow-up by law enforcement.

04:30:22.009 --> 04:30:31.797
As Cindy cited to you, the Ed Code section that deals with our reports, when we determine based on the evidence available to us that there may have been fraud,

04:30:32.518 --> 04:30:36.141
misappropriation of funds or other illegal fiscal activities and that's key.

04:30:37.001 --> 04:30:41.084
The standard that we are to follow in the code is we determine there may or may not have been.

04:30:41.665 --> 04:30:47.168
We don't prosecute as you're well aware of and we certainly aren't the judge in this case.

04:30:47.609 --> 04:30:49.090
So we don't know that frauds occurred.

04:30:49.450 --> 04:30:52.212
We believe there's sufficient evidence that there may have been.

04:30:52.232 --> 04:30:58.897
That then triggers a reporting requirement as Cindy outlined that includes the local district attorney.

04:31:00.380 --> 04:31:04.784
And so, in part, these would be things we would point to the local district attorney.

04:31:04.925 --> 04:31:20.459
You need to develop your probable cause and work through this to get answers to these, whether that's in a cooperative manner with the parties or whether that's through their subpoena power, which we don't possess.

04:31:22.133 --> 04:31:26.098
And Dr. Kirsch, did you ask about something on page 25?

04:31:26.519 --> 04:31:36.412
Yeah, there's again ELS mentioned and you can discuss also I think why you can't obtain these things from ELS.

04:31:37.654 --> 04:31:51.022
Yeah, I mean, why don't we have... So, certainly the code limits our reach as it does the county office and really kind of all of us to the charter school itself, right?

04:31:51.042 --> 04:31:52.342
It doesn't go beyond that.

04:31:52.502 --> 04:31:56.425
And as you've spent the morning and afternoon discussing these very complex

04:31:57.265 --> 04:31:57.946
structures.

04:31:59.587 --> 04:32:01.128
Eric has spoke about them.

04:32:01.148 --> 04:32:03.510
We encounter these on a pretty regular basis.

04:32:04.551 --> 04:32:06.712
There is a wall eventually that we hit.

04:32:07.453 --> 04:32:15.359
In many, many cases the CMO or the EMO or whatever you want to call those other organizations are cooperative.

04:32:16.079 --> 04:32:17.761
Many, many times they're cooperative.

04:32:17.801 --> 04:32:22.685
In this case, ELS which was identified as the CMO was not cooperative with us.

04:32:23.465 --> 04:32:34.789
And in fact we reached out to them and their attorney responded to us that both Mrs. Roach and ELS was not available to us and their records were not available to us.

04:32:35.309 --> 04:32:42.571
What's important in our interpretation at this point is that OPA as we know it and ELS are one in the same.

04:32:43.111 --> 04:32:44.552
They are the alter ego of

04:32:45.112 --> 04:32:45.553
each other.

04:32:46.573 --> 04:32:51.957
They are for all intents and purposes the same under the same control.

04:32:53.138 --> 04:32:58.222
They're under the same basically functioning structure and so on.

04:32:58.322 --> 04:33:04.987
And so to us they're one in the same and therefore we didn't interpret that wall as being where they interpret that wall.

04:33:05.008 --> 04:33:08.951
That is that ELS should have under the code provided us

04:33:09.951 --> 04:33:13.553
all of their documents just as the charter school would be obligated to provide us.

04:33:14.233 --> 04:33:29.100
And so important on page 25 and this gets to the asset transfer issue and whether ELS is holding assets that actually belong to OPA and again Cindy identified some of those.

04:33:31.030 --> 04:33:43.097
This actually goes back to page 19 and 20 where we reference a March 4th 2015 letter to the IRS by ELS.

04:33:44.038 --> 04:33:54.384
Where ELS had applied for non-profit status to the IRS but they went further and asked that they be considered a school.

04:33:56.136 --> 04:33:59.218
under IRC Sections 509 and 170.

04:34:00.079 --> 04:34:09.187
And that's important because it gives them additional privileges, if you will, under the federal tax code.

04:34:09.808 --> 04:34:13.891
And so in there, and I apologize for shuffling here.

04:34:13.911 --> 04:34:17.114
I turned my pages upside down as I put them back in order.

04:34:19.636 --> 04:34:20.297
In that letter,

04:34:23.729 --> 04:34:27.999
their attorneys basically argued that

04:34:31.161 --> 04:34:34.203
They weren't just a non-profit organization, but they were a school.

04:34:34.463 --> 04:34:46.191
And they explained that they believe they qualify for the school exemptions pursuant to the integral part doctrine, which is a legal doctrine with respect to the tax code.

04:34:47.032 --> 04:34:49.353
And they go on to cite some of that.

04:34:49.413 --> 04:34:54.196
But basically, they are arguing to the IRS that they are, in fact, one in the same.

04:34:54.377 --> 04:34:58.139
They exist for the same purpose, making our very point.

04:34:58.319 --> 04:35:00.261
And this is actually the section we relied on.

04:35:01.121 --> 04:35:10.568
The letter that was just distributed to you, I believe, actually says that we relied on, in our conclusions, on a memorandum of understanding with the district.

04:35:10.628 --> 04:35:22.636
And in fact, it's the pleadings under penalty of perjury to the IRS in this March 15th letter that their attorneys wrote that we actually relied on to say that these are one and the same.

04:35:23.056 --> 04:35:24.197
Because that was their argument.

04:35:24.617 --> 04:35:26.478
The two organizations were one and the same.

04:35:26.498 --> 04:35:28.860
That was their argument to the IRS.

04:35:29.540 --> 04:35:29.841
And that's...

04:35:30.521 --> 04:35:40.472
Important here because there's been a transfer of assets, as Cindy alluded to, including potentially modular buildings, furniture and equipment.

04:35:41.133 --> 04:35:44.377
And they actually say this in their letter to the IRS.

04:35:45.598 --> 04:35:51.805
Modular buildings, furniture, equipment and fixtures necessary for Oxford to operate.

04:35:53.356 --> 04:36:01.994
And so if we have a charter school and we're concerned about its future and its ability to operate, which obviously is a determination you have to make, if some other entity

04:36:03.164 --> 04:36:14.292
is in control of part of those assets that are needed, which was the argument to the IRS that these two are one in the same, then that certainly was a concern.

04:36:14.792 --> 04:36:26.621
Just so you know, in a letter to the district less than two months later after the pleadings to the IRS, the OPA slash ELS disputed

04:36:28.295 --> 04:36:38.263
that OPA and ELS in fact were one in the same and they disputed the fact that ELS held assets.

04:36:39.184 --> 04:36:44.328
So, in May of 16, less than a year ago, they were still disputing that.

04:36:44.388 --> 04:36:56.218
In fact, just about a year, you know, 13 months ago, they had argued to the IRS that in fact they were one in the same and that ELS held assets.

04:36:57.498 --> 04:37:06.005
The significance here is that they've argued under penalty of perjury to the IRS that they're one in the same, alter ego of each other.

04:37:06.806 --> 04:37:08.828
Therefore, the record should have been made available to us.

04:37:09.368 --> 04:37:14.913
And so the non-cooperation, if you will, and I should clearly distinguish this.

04:37:16.154 --> 04:37:18.676
OPA, as we know it as a charter school,

04:37:20.097 --> 04:37:23.719
I would say fully cooperated with us and that's important.

04:37:24.919 --> 04:37:31.702
ELS and its governance, the folks involved in its governance did not cooperate with us at all.

04:37:32.243 --> 04:37:37.145
And yet, I think we interpret them as being at this point one of the same.

04:37:37.825 --> 04:37:44.012
Consolidation of financial data then is also relevant here because to follow through with the accounting standards.

04:37:44.873 --> 04:37:48.877
If you are, these two organizations are one in the same, they should be consolidated.

04:37:49.738 --> 04:37:58.086
OPA in multiple documents argued that ELS was simply another vendor like all other vendors.

04:37:58.127 --> 04:37:59.768
We just make payments to them when they bill us.

04:38:01.189 --> 04:38:04.091
That's what they argued to the school district when the school district questioned them.

04:38:04.552 --> 04:38:08.034
That's what they argued with us when we were doing our investigation.

04:38:09.155 --> 04:38:11.636
That is actually not the relationship that they shared.

04:38:11.656 --> 04:38:15.879
It was not a vendor-client, if you will, relationship.

04:38:17.180 --> 04:38:17.440
Okay.

04:38:17.480 --> 04:38:18.200
Thank you for that.

04:38:19.281 --> 04:38:24.324
We ought to get some of this on the record and you'll be here in the rest of the time.

04:38:24.464 --> 04:38:26.626
Other board member technical questions?

04:38:27.026 --> 04:38:27.627
Board member Burr.

04:38:29.238 --> 04:38:30.658
This is for Cindy, I think.

04:38:31.959 --> 04:38:33.659
Thank you, Mike, for your presentation.

04:38:34.519 --> 04:38:47.962
In our item, it says that on January 3rd, 2017, the San Bernardino County Office of Education approved a motion to not receive the renewal petition or establish a timeline for consideration of the appeal.

04:38:49.383 --> 04:38:54.264
I did not know that the county office had the option to not consider an appeal.

04:38:54.304 --> 04:38:55.844
Am I reading that incorrectly?

04:38:56.425 --> 04:38:58.266
No, that was the same with Solarity.

04:38:58.706 --> 04:39:02.768
LACOE or LA County Board of Education also did not consider.

04:39:02.808 --> 04:39:05.950
They put it on their agenda, but then they don't hear it.

04:39:06.410 --> 04:39:08.972
They don't, you know, they don't take an action on it.

04:39:09.312 --> 04:39:18.817
So that seems to greatly diminish the ability of charter petitioners to get a fair shot at the local level.

04:39:19.817 --> 04:39:28.202
And that's the whole process is supposed to rely on consideration of the district and then the county before they get it up here.

04:39:28.302 --> 04:39:34.586
So, I just like to know what we can do about that to make them assume their responsibilities.

04:39:38.469 --> 04:39:39.529
The legal question, yeah.

04:39:39.609 --> 04:39:39.949
All right, Judy.

04:39:39.969 --> 04:39:47.074
If that would require a statute change right now, the county board would have to prove to have the ability to choose to not hear it.

04:39:47.094 --> 04:39:48.114
And in some cases,

04:39:49.655 --> 04:39:53.114
It's in the agreement of both parties to not hear, and in some cases, it's that the CAF is to speak.

04:39:57.631 --> 04:40:00.633
Okay, so that clarifies that issue.

04:40:00.673 --> 04:40:06.058
We'll have to, it's a statutory problem from that standpoint.

04:40:06.958 --> 04:40:08.579
Yes, we'll open the public hearing.

04:40:09.080 --> 04:40:19.448
Okay, I will give 10 minutes each to each side and we'll start with the group of the petitioners for the charter.

04:40:19.528 --> 04:40:20.949
That group, please come forward.

04:40:41.363 --> 04:40:41.743
Go ahead.

04:40:44.004 --> 04:40:50.726
Good afternoon, Board President Kirst, members of the State Board of Education, Assistant Superintendent Price, and staff.

04:40:51.286 --> 04:40:56.708
My name is Denise Pasco, the Interim Executive Director of Oxford Preparatory Academy Charter Schools.

04:40:58.001 --> 04:41:02.004
The graphs you have before you are last year's CASP results for our Chino Valley campus.

04:41:02.744 --> 04:41:07.267
Our student results outperformed the local school district, the county, and state averages.

04:41:08.068 --> 04:41:15.953
With a student population of Hispanic 49.5%, Caucasian 22.1%, Asian 13.4%, African-American 2.2%, Filipino 5.9%, and two or more at 6.9%, we were the number one K-8 school in San Bernardino County.

04:41:28.564 --> 04:41:29.124
Good afternoon.

04:41:29.645 --> 04:41:32.567
My name is Andrew Vestey, board chair of Oxford Preparatory Academy.

04:41:33.208 --> 04:41:42.115
I appreciate the opportunity to update you on the action this board has taken over the past six months to restore integrity and transparency to our operations and governance.

04:41:42.956 --> 04:41:48.621
Last November, when the FCMA audit was issued, our parents were devastated to learn what our founder, Sue Roach, had done.

04:41:49.581 --> 04:41:51.423
It was her job to protect our children.

04:41:51.663 --> 04:41:54.766
Instead, she used our children to enrich herself and her family.

04:41:56.089 --> 04:41:56.689
It was wrong.

04:41:56.889 --> 04:41:57.550
It was immoral.

04:41:57.670 --> 04:41:58.610
It was unforgivable.

04:41:59.190 --> 04:42:04.372
We knew we were about to lose something very special because of one person's greed if Oxford didn't fix the problem.

04:42:05.112 --> 04:42:08.893
After all, we are Oxford Prep, not Sue Roach.

04:42:09.474 --> 04:42:10.294
This is our school.

04:42:11.094 --> 04:42:14.595
Parents, students, and community members came together to say enough.

04:42:15.656 --> 04:42:18.457
They wanted everyone who was responsible for this tragedy out.

04:42:19.397 --> 04:42:24.979
They demanded Barbara Black, the executive management team, and the former board chair be removed.

04:42:26.203 --> 04:42:28.424
Three parents were now in charge of the board of directors.

04:42:28.804 --> 04:42:33.486
While this was new territory to us, FCMAT provided a roadmap to recovery.

04:42:34.246 --> 04:42:36.787
We hired experts to help us navigate the legal issues.

04:42:37.267 --> 04:42:43.750
We hired new auditors and a back office provider, Charter Impact, to help us unravel the mess the previous administration had created.

04:42:44.659 --> 04:42:51.845
We removed anyone who was in a position of authority that led to the fiscal mismanagement or culture that allowed it to happen.

04:42:52.645 --> 04:42:54.487
The CMO ELS, gone.

04:42:55.308 --> 04:42:56.529
Sue Roach, gone.

04:42:57.369 --> 04:42:58.610
Barbara Black, gone.

04:42:59.551 --> 04:43:01.332
The entire management team, gone.

04:43:01.973 --> 04:43:04.695
The entire board of directors, gone.

04:43:04.715 --> 04:43:05.776
12 people eliminated.

04:43:06.497 --> 04:43:10.300
The only people left were teachers, chancellors, and classified staff.

04:43:11.448 --> 04:43:17.354
and five strangers driven by one passion to save a school for 1,200 innocent children who did nothing wrong.

04:43:18.174 --> 04:43:20.557
The new board put our skills to work to turn things around.

04:43:21.337 --> 04:43:22.819
We knew we were starting from scratch.

04:43:23.319 --> 04:43:25.281
We had to rebuild our budgets from the ground up.

04:43:26.082 --> 04:43:28.244
We didn't even have access to all of our bank accounts.

04:43:29.045 --> 04:43:33.148
The past management made all decisions at the top and tightly controlled everything.

04:43:33.429 --> 04:43:34.410
Now we understood why.

04:43:35.802 --> 04:43:38.927
Our renewal petition was due in less than three weeks at the county.

04:43:39.648 --> 04:43:42.292
So we needed an interim management team who had knowledge.

04:43:46.618 --> 04:43:48.180
Sorry, had knowledge.

04:43:49.241 --> 04:43:51.522
of our educational program to lead our renewal efforts.

04:43:52.023 --> 04:43:56.345
Our chancellors who had administrative experience and knew our curriculum were the best choices.

04:43:57.145 --> 04:43:57.966
Let me be clear.

04:43:58.626 --> 04:44:00.207
We carefully vetted our chancellors.

04:44:00.667 --> 04:44:05.449
They were school level employees who had no authority over operational decisions or finances.

04:44:06.150 --> 04:44:08.271
Three separate independent auditors agree.

04:44:09.051 --> 04:44:12.173
The chancellors didn't even have access to their own budgets.

04:44:12.793 --> 04:44:15.595
Again, all money and decisions were tightly controlled at the top.

04:44:16.621 --> 04:44:25.824
Over the next six months, this board would hold 21 board meetings and approve 11 new policies and procedures to correct the concerns that led to the alleged fraud and misappropriation of funds.

04:44:26.544 --> 04:44:33.526
We also hired an independent third-party financial management company to take over disbursements, budgeting, payroll, and bookkeeping.

04:44:34.486 --> 04:44:41.588
In five months, we eliminated all conflicts of interest, put internal controls in place to ensure something like this can never happen again.

04:44:43.168 --> 04:44:47.289
We also filed a lawsuit against Sue Roach and ELS to recover public funds.

04:44:48.149 --> 04:44:50.190
But the board wanted another layer of safeguards.

04:44:50.630 --> 04:44:59.252
We hired a state-approved auditing firm to complete independent monthly reviews to our finances and internal controls to ensure they were effective and our finances were clean.

04:44:59.952 --> 04:45:03.193
Two monthly reviews have been completed and no concerns have been reported.

04:45:04.033 --> 04:45:13.016
The ACCS recommended as a contingency of our approval that we also contract with a third-party fiscal service to ensure all FCMAT audit findings had been addressed.

04:45:13.957 --> 04:45:20.139
We immediately contacted FCMAT, and discussions led to the selection of Christy White and associates to complete the verification.

04:45:21.020 --> 04:45:23.821
We received this results slide from Christy White last Friday.

04:45:24.481 --> 04:45:28.102
A score of one is best, indicating the corrective action had been implemented.

04:45:29.343 --> 04:45:32.644
Four have been resolved, and three require minimal action to complete.

04:45:33.428 --> 04:45:35.589
Number one, lack of internal controls.

04:45:36.169 --> 04:45:37.669
All internal controls are in place.

04:45:38.389 --> 04:45:43.471
This portion will be complete when the board and staff complete their ethics training, which is currently underway.

04:45:44.251 --> 04:45:48.112
Number two, failure to disclose related party affiliates and transactions.

04:45:48.772 --> 04:45:50.913
This was an issue with Oxford's financial audits.

04:45:51.273 --> 04:45:54.974
We just received the draft of our reissued audit showing related party affiliates.

04:45:55.594 --> 04:45:58.115
Once the final audit is submitted, this will be complete.

04:45:58.945 --> 04:46:01.406
Improper use of public funds on personal expenditures.

04:46:01.987 --> 04:46:05.448
We are in the early stages of litigation against Sue Roach and ELS.

04:46:05.949 --> 04:46:09.951
Once public funds have been recovered, this will be complete.

04:46:11.211 --> 04:46:15.093
Oxford has 2,500 students in three schools with three different authorizers.

04:46:15.713 --> 04:46:18.915
Chino Unified continues to say our board lacks transparency.

04:46:19.135 --> 04:46:20.576
Our other authorizers disagree.

04:46:21.256 --> 04:46:28.420
Capasana Unified and the Orange County Board of Education have not only acknowledged but commended us on our transparency and continuing dialogue.

04:46:29.400 --> 04:46:32.001
Consequently, neither has moved to revoke our charters.

04:46:33.102 --> 04:46:34.782
Same governance, different outcomes.

04:46:35.843 --> 04:46:40.665
It has been clear since the beginning, Chino is interested in one outcome, closing our school.

04:46:41.285 --> 04:46:42.646
Orange County wants to save them.

04:46:43.787 --> 04:46:52.871
While we have done everything that has been asked of us, if this board decides additional changes are needed, we will accept any technical amendments or conditions to keep our school open.

04:46:54.073 --> 04:47:00.457
The CDE believes the steps we have taken to resolve the concerns raised in the FCMAT report are insufficient and therefore we should be denied.

04:47:00.997 --> 04:47:07.402
However, that was prior to receiving the FCMAT review from Christy White indicating all remaining concerns have now been addressed.

04:47:08.122 --> 04:47:12.285
Let me answer the eight CDE questions that stands between Oxford and renewal.

04:47:13.308 --> 04:47:18.592
We have one board member who was a founding parent and had nothing to do with previous board or management.

04:47:18.873 --> 04:47:21.495
He has voted in favor of all corrective actions.

04:47:22.355 --> 04:47:24.317
Two board members have finance experience.

04:47:24.937 --> 04:47:30.222
One is CBO trained in budgeting and finance and has 14 years of clean audits with no findings.

04:47:30.782 --> 04:47:36.087
The other has 25 years of experience in public and private oversight, auditing and accounting.

04:47:37.065 --> 04:47:41.667
The organizational chart in our petition states that our chancellors will report to our executive director.

04:47:42.188 --> 04:47:44.709
Currently, our chancellors report to the managing director.

04:47:45.709 --> 04:47:48.231
OPA's nepotism policy allows too much latitude.

04:47:48.811 --> 04:47:49.371
We agree.

04:47:49.871 --> 04:47:52.233
We changed this at our March 27 board meeting.

04:47:53.113 --> 04:47:58.376
The findings from three audits became our recovery plan, the foundation for our efforts to recover funds.

04:47:59.244 --> 04:48:07.166
The board has attended fraud training, Oxford has no leased employees, and two signatures are required for approval of any expense over $10,000.

04:48:07.386 --> 04:48:11.447
Those signatures are the executive director and board chairman.

04:48:12.087 --> 04:48:16.168
As you can see, all eight of the CDE's remaining concerns have been resolved.

04:48:16.728 --> 04:48:19.709
We have taken full responsibility for the actions of Sue Roach.

04:48:20.349 --> 04:48:25.710
Please don't judge us today what she did, but by what we have done to restore integrity and trust.

04:48:27.685 --> 04:48:32.467
Andrew Crow and I have been in support of a National School Lunch Program since we joined the organization.

04:48:33.068 --> 04:48:46.414
To move forward with our plan, we have entered into a contract with School Food and Wellness Group to provide assistance in conducting and managing the administrative aspects of the National School Lunch Program, and we are on track to begin this at all campuses this next school year.

04:48:46.974 --> 04:48:48.555
This has since been approved by CDE.

04:48:49.818 --> 04:49:02.046
Our team and six independent financial experts, legal experts, and auditors have spent countless hours reviewing every transaction, contract, and correspondence to determine if there were any unknown obligations.

04:49:03.027 --> 04:49:05.028
No new obligations have been discovered.

04:49:05.949 --> 04:49:11.913
On April 27, 2017, our board voted to pay off our only remaining loan.

04:49:12.673 --> 04:49:19.458
We are aware of exactly what our extended liabilities are, and we have ample cash reserves to meet all of our obligations.

04:49:21.480 --> 04:49:30.288
We are projecting the school to finish the year with a surplus of over $1 million and with combined cash and public receivables of approximately $1.8 million and zero long-term debt.

04:49:33.700 --> 04:49:39.142
The budget projections contained in the chart show a large and growing ending fund balance over the next five years.

04:49:40.102 --> 04:49:44.104
The projected cash balance is 10.1% of projected full year expenses.

04:49:45.104 --> 04:49:52.527
According to our financials, we are very strong in spite of all that is taking place, and we still have a wait list of students wishing to be admitted.

04:49:53.593 --> 04:49:54.254
I'm Andrew Crow.

04:49:54.274 --> 04:49:55.755
I'm the interim managing director.

04:49:56.476 --> 04:49:59.579
Oxford Preparatory Academy is the only charter school in Chino Valley.

04:49:59.960 --> 04:50:02.322
Our families come from three neighboring counties.

04:50:03.063 --> 04:50:15.636
With everything in the news currently about social emotional issues, anxiety, and a lack of welcoming environments, the last thing we want is children as young as five years old to be forced to schools that don't want them and can't challenge them academically.

04:50:17.927 --> 04:50:19.348
There are two paths in front of you today.

04:50:19.929 --> 04:50:24.553
One path allows our students to continue excelling at the number one K-8 school in the entire county.

04:50:25.394 --> 04:50:28.837
The other is filled with despair, stress, and underperformance.

04:50:29.498 --> 04:50:31.419
Please don't force my kids down that path.

04:50:32.020 --> 04:50:38.786
The majority of our kids, my kids, the kids I fight for every day, will be forced to homeschools that are drastically underperforming.

04:50:39.667 --> 04:50:42.630
Our kids deserve the Oxford path instead of the alternative.

04:50:43.976 --> 04:50:53.638
At Oxford, we are successful for all students because we use SDI strategies, teach ELA content standards through social studies and science, and set rigorous collaborative goals at IEP meetings.

04:50:54.158 --> 04:51:01.360
Please take a moment to look at what will happen to our English learners, our SCS disadvantaged students, and students with disabilities if you close their school.

04:51:03.541 --> 04:51:08.722
How can we set high expectations for our kids that need us the most when we are closing the school that serves them the best?

04:51:11.010 --> 04:51:21.552
So for the 989 returning students and the 623 families that filled out intent to enroll forms for a school that might be forced to close, their future depends on you.

04:51:22.072 --> 04:51:23.613
Please vote in the best interest of our kids.

04:51:27.234 --> 04:51:27.574
Thank you.

04:51:27.854 --> 04:51:28.254
Thank you.

04:51:29.334 --> 04:51:37.576
Okay, now we have 10 minutes for the opponents of the petitioners.

04:51:49.454 --> 04:51:52.876
Good afternoon, honorable members of the State Board of Education.

04:51:52.896 --> 04:51:57.337
I am Stephen Archadish, your counselor for the Chena Valley Unified School District.

04:51:57.898 --> 04:52:01.499
My superintendent, Mr. Wayne Joseph, is here today also.

04:52:02.500 --> 04:52:07.502
Today, the district asks that the board adopt the CD staff recommendation.

04:52:09.315 --> 04:52:26.969
to deny the Oxford Charter renewal based upon CD's finding that the Oxford petitioners are not likely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition because of Oxford's history of fiscal mismanagement and because Oxford has presented an unrealistic operational plan

04:52:28.015 --> 04:52:46.826
And because OSHRA's budget cannot be deemed viable due to the potential of undiscovered contracts, transactions, extended liabilities, loans and obligations, and the lack of valid audit reports, we believe the CDE, we ask

04:52:48.109 --> 04:52:50.354
Not because our district is anti-charter.

04:52:50.915 --> 04:52:56.526
In fact, our board voted twice to unanimously approve OPHNO in 2010 and again in 2012.

04:53:00.410 --> 04:53:04.472
And we ask not without concern for Oxford students.

04:53:05.373 --> 04:53:11.396
Instead, we ask because we have statutory oversight over OPA's fiscal condition.

04:53:12.236 --> 04:53:26.724
And as you have heard from Mr. Fine, FCMAT found that the Oxford Board Administration staff and Oxford's culture permitted Oxford's founder and former executive director to divert over $4.7 million of public funds.

04:53:30.185 --> 04:53:37.309
We asked also because we see the parents of Oxford students' reaction.

04:53:39.070 --> 04:53:46.053
Our perspective on their reaction is that our district has accepted 129 Oxford student transfers this school year.

04:53:46.693 --> 04:53:53.037
And additionally, our district has 449 Oxford student transfer requests for the 2017-18 school year.

04:53:59.727 --> 04:54:00.387
Coincidence.

04:54:01.287 --> 04:54:17.351
One year ago today, in a letter dated May 11, 2016, Oxford wrote, as for how and when funds have been spent by Enlighten, just like our other vendors, contractors, and service providers, Enlighten is a separate entity with separate records.

04:54:18.391 --> 04:54:28.154
OPA cannot document, and it is unreasonable for the district to ask OPA to document how and when all funds were spent by the separate entity.

04:54:29.099 --> 04:54:43.838
As you have heard at page 10, the CED notes that ELS has refused to provide financial and personnel records to FCMAT even though it is clear evidence that ELS and Oxford are affiliated and related parties.

04:54:44.859 --> 04:54:46.741
What a difference a year makes.

04:54:48.405 --> 04:54:59.650
Now, Oxford says a new Oxford Prep Board Administration along with staff and parent community are fully committed to restoring integrity and trust throughout the Oxford organization.

04:55:00.670 --> 04:55:04.572
Isn't it interesting that Oxford admits its integrity has to be restored?

04:55:04.592 --> 04:55:05.172
Why is that?

04:55:07.284 --> 04:55:32.498
Maybe because the FCMAT audit stated this report provides sufficient evidence that affiliated and related party organizations were intentionally created to divert and launder funds from Oxford Preparatory Academy and conceal the use of those funds from the Oversight Agency, Chino Valley Unified School District, Independent Auditor of Oxford Preparatory Academy, and all others that relied on the financial statements and independent financial audits.

04:55:34.867 --> 04:55:39.989
Members of the State Board, please note FCMAT's use of the word intentionally.

04:55:40.929 --> 04:55:42.330
All this was no accident.

04:55:42.550 --> 04:55:50.012
Oxford's board, management, and employees set out deliberately to deceive their oversight agency and Oxford's own auditors.

04:55:51.093 --> 04:55:57.755
When I was a child, I always wondered, once someone starts lying to you, how do you tell when they stop?

04:55:59.690 --> 04:56:08.066
Please remember that the CD states that OSHRA's current governance structure is essentially the same as it was when OSHRA's leadership engaged in fiscal mismanagement.

04:56:09.548 --> 04:56:12.053
Again, that's what CD believes.

04:56:13.354 --> 04:56:24.217
District acknowledges that the Oxford Board of Directors was replaced, but notes that the current Oxford Board members were unilaterally appointed by the outgoing Oxford Board implicated by the FCMAT audit.

04:56:24.877 --> 04:56:35.420
And as the CD states, the change in executive leadership are not completely unrelated parties, as they served as school leaders within the organization when the fiscal mismanagement occurred.

04:56:36.875 --> 04:56:57.114
At the March 2nd, 2017, Oxford board meeting, Oxford employees seized, redacted, returned, and then seized again and tore out entire pages of financial information regarding severance payments of public charter school money to Oxford's former executive director, Barbara Black.

04:56:58.135 --> 04:57:01.759
From a board meeting packet that had already been distributed to members of the public,

04:57:03.064 --> 04:57:08.146
in attendance at the March 2nd Oxford Board meeting.

04:57:08.646 --> 04:57:17.468
This was done under the direction and the presence of the new Oxford Board and with the consent of Oxford's new back office service provider, Charter Impact.

04:57:18.649 --> 04:57:29.992
More recently at the April 5th Advisory Commission meeting, Oxford seemed unaware of and failed to explain two $1 million loan agreements between Oxford and the California Credit Union

04:57:31.076 --> 04:57:50.709
signed by then-Oxford Executive Director Barbara Black on August 31st, 2016, which had not been discovered by the district until March 24th, 2017, raising doubts regarding Oxford's claimed strong financial position and still more doubts regarding Oxford's supposed transparency.

04:57:51.389 --> 04:57:55.272
Now, August 31st, 2016 is an interesting date.

04:57:56.013 --> 04:57:56.673
Because why?

04:57:56.793 --> 04:57:57.694
Because the Oxford

04:57:58.917 --> 04:58:01.701
Oxford FICMAT audit was in progress.

04:58:02.422 --> 04:58:06.788
So FICMAT is coming around and talking to them and investigating them.

04:58:07.489 --> 04:58:10.594
And Barbara Black is signing $1 million loan agreements.

04:58:12.295 --> 04:58:12.895
It's amazing.

04:58:13.716 --> 04:58:21.520
At the April 5th Advisory Commission meeting, Oxford's Management and Charter Impact representatives were unable to adequately explain the two $1 million loan agreements.

04:58:22.160 --> 04:58:37.428
While Oxford Interim Executive Director Denise Pascoe informed the Advisory Commission that Oxford has a $1.3 million line of credit, at the April 11th Oxford Board meeting, Oxford Board Treasurer Naveen Adly stated it was a $1.2 million loan.

04:58:40.054 --> 04:58:50.841
The fact that even after the FICMAT audit, Oxford's governing body and management are unaware of the amounts and terms of Oxford's existing financial obligations is almost beyond belief.

04:58:54.764 --> 04:58:58.567
Now let's talk about students, hungry students, because

04:59:00.268 --> 04:59:13.892
After over seven and a half years of operations, Oxford still does not offer, may begin to, we've heard, free or reduced price meals in our district, where 46.4% of students are eligible for free or reduced price meals.

04:59:14.512 --> 04:59:22.874
And in a neighborhood in which 72.5% of students attending an elementary school very near Oxford are eligible for free or reduced price meals.

04:59:23.514 --> 04:59:28.376
The impact of Oxford's policy on the enrollment of socioeconomically disadvantaged students

04:59:29.617 --> 04:59:29.977
as Ms.

04:59:30.038 --> 04:59:45.632
Chan said, is clear from the smaller percentage of Oxford students eligible for free or reduced price meals, only 24.7% in my statistics, not much more than half of the district's free or reduced price meal eligibility of 46.4%.

04:59:46.813 --> 04:59:51.057
At page 12, under enrollment barriers, the CD states that

04:59:52.099 --> 05:00:01.154
The advisory commissions opined that the lack of a free or reduced price meal option at Oxford would prevent some families from enrolling at Oxford.

05:00:03.007 --> 05:00:04.008
I wonder how that was.

05:00:05.030 --> 05:00:21.830
We note that the San Bernardino County Board of Education raised the issue of Oxford's lack of a free or reduced-price meal program over 11 months ago at its June 10, 2016 meeting, but somehow Oxford still does not have a free or reduced-price lunch program.

05:00:22.691 --> 05:00:36.200
For all the above reasons, Oxford's attempts to address the concerns originally raised by the district 14 months ago in March 2016, a lot of activity lately, hasn't there been, are much too little and much too late.

05:00:36.860 --> 05:00:48.768
The April 6, 2017 Oxford response to the Advisory Commission staff report states, well, former administrators of OPA may be accused of improprieties by the district,

05:00:50.834 --> 05:00:58.580
The former employees no longer work for the organization, nor do they have any say in the ongoing operations or governance of Oxford.

05:00:59.360 --> 05:01:04.885
In other words, Oxford admits it has terminated former Oxford administrators who participated in the proprieties.

05:01:04.965 --> 05:01:06.106
I believe you saw their chart.

05:01:06.826 --> 05:01:21.212
But the district believes it is an odd consequence for Oxford when Oxford also admits it has paid over $212,000 in public charter school funds and settlement payments to four terminated former Oxford administrators.

05:01:22.052 --> 05:01:34.377
For the State Board to renew Oxford today when the CDE finds after review of the FCMAT findings that OPA leadership failed to meet generally accepted accounting principles and engaged in fiscal mismanagement

05:01:35.057 --> 05:01:55.003
And despite Oxford's exclusion of socioeconomically disadvantaged students and despite Oxford's failure to have taken sufficient remedial measures regarding its governance internal controls over five months after the FICMAT audit, according to CDE, is the district believes for the state board to send a clear message

05:01:56.786 --> 05:01:59.668
that there are no real consequences for OSHRA's illegal acts.

05:02:00.429 --> 05:02:06.933
For these reasons, the district respectfully requests that the State Board adopt a CD recommendation and deny OSHRA's Charter of Renewal Appeal.

05:02:07.113 --> 05:02:07.553
Thank you.

05:02:09.314 --> 05:02:09.635
Okay.

05:02:09.655 --> 05:02:10.015
Thank you.

05:02:10.775 --> 05:02:15.418
Ten minutes are up and we now have a list of public comment.

05:02:18.140 --> 05:02:19.081
Close public hearing.

05:02:24.571 --> 05:02:26.552
Would the following speakers please line up?

05:02:26.752 --> 05:02:51.686
Jenny Blatner, Philip Vanderclay, Annie Ingridswood, Grace Park, Liz Penzik, Sandra Chen, Janelle Rooley, Eric Premack, Michelle Lynch, Spencer Stiles, Deborah Tarver, Naveen Adly, Vivian Sanchez, Sarah Marinko, Gavin Diaz, Brandon McNair,

05:02:56.892 --> 05:02:58.132
Thank you for this opportunity.

05:02:58.272 --> 05:03:06.575
My name is Jenny Bladner, and I'm going to try and put myself in your shoes and ask if this is a top performing school, why are we still in this situation?

05:03:07.155 --> 05:03:08.456
I believe for a couple of reasons.

05:03:09.096 --> 05:03:10.036
Your parents?

05:03:10.697 --> 05:03:12.237
From Oxford.

05:03:12.257 --> 05:03:12.297
OK.

05:03:12.917 --> 05:03:13.197
OPA.

05:03:13.337 --> 05:03:13.397
OK.

05:03:13.417 --> 05:03:14.278
Do I get more time?

05:03:14.298 --> 05:03:17.299
Yeah, you get more time.

05:03:19.329 --> 05:03:20.229
Okay, we'll start again.

05:03:20.930 --> 05:03:22.991
Please identify yourself as you come up.

05:03:23.271 --> 05:03:23.571
Okay.

05:03:24.452 --> 05:03:25.432
Again, thank you.

05:03:25.452 --> 05:03:26.913
Jenny Blattner from Oxford.

05:03:27.393 --> 05:03:34.757
And I try and put myself in your situation and in your shoes and ask if this is a top performing school, why are we still in this situation?

05:03:34.857 --> 05:03:36.338
And I believe it's for a couple reasons.

05:03:36.718 --> 05:03:39.460
First, it's critical that we're aware of all the changes.

05:03:40.160 --> 05:03:46.625
However, at the hearing on April 5th, the district said the school's governance was essentially the same.

05:03:47.245 --> 05:03:52.209
But I sent each of you a chart and it showed that there was nothing the same.

05:03:54.051 --> 05:04:02.717
They also accused the new administration lack of transparency and said the line of credit was just revealed on March 24th.

05:04:03.258 --> 05:04:07.741
However, it was actually reported in the first interim report on December 23rd.

05:04:09.082 --> 05:04:16.749
The superintendent had a 35-year collegiate relationship with the former founder, Sue Roach.

05:04:17.409 --> 05:04:25.436
And after she betrayed his trust, the new board and interim staff has suffered from less communication and openness to move forward.

05:04:26.257 --> 05:04:28.779
Given the chance, they will rebuild your trust.

05:04:29.099 --> 05:04:29.880
Thank you very much.

05:04:34.602 --> 05:04:36.043
Good afternoon, Mr. Chair and members.

05:04:36.283 --> 05:04:37.163
My name is Philip Vander Kley.

05:04:37.183 --> 05:04:39.104
I'm a staffer for Senator Connie Leyva.

05:04:39.584 --> 05:04:45.866
Senator Leyva would like me to convey her support for Oxford Preparatory Academy, Chino Valley, and their charter renewal.

05:04:46.567 --> 05:04:53.870
This high-achieving school is located in the Senator's district and serves over 1,200 students with very positive educational results.

05:04:54.930 --> 05:05:05.534
Though the previous fiscal conflicts and mismanagement were very troubling, OPA CV has since made significant changes to its structure and leadership in order to address those conflicts.

05:05:05.974 --> 05:05:15.078
The proposed ongoing fiscal oversight and auditing is certainly appropriate because the proper use of public funds should always be insured, especially when dealing with our children's education.

05:05:15.778 --> 05:05:25.850
The Senator has spoken with many of her constituents regarding their great experiences at OPCV, and she recognizes how the school's closure would disrupt their families' lives.

05:05:26.291 --> 05:05:29.955
With these considerations in mind, Senator Leyva asks for your support of this charter renewal.

05:05:30.356 --> 05:05:30.616
Thank you.

05:05:38.846 --> 05:05:42.167
Good afternoon, Board President Kurst and members of the Board.

05:05:42.627 --> 05:05:44.007
My name is Ana Inglesrud.

05:05:44.047 --> 05:05:47.408
I'm the Director of Special Education for Chino Valley Unified School District.

05:05:48.288 --> 05:06:01.152
Oxford should not be renewed because Oxford has a history of failing to provide sufficient services to its special education student population and counseling out students with special needs that require and request additional services.

05:06:01.892 --> 05:06:11.582
As already mentioned in regards to disparity of socioeconomic levels, I have concerns when I look at the students with exceptional needs within Oxford.

05:06:12.262 --> 05:06:23.513
As a district, we average for 2015-16 school year between 12.1% and 12.2% of our students on IEPs, whereas Oxford is serving a student population of 7.5%.

05:06:26.355 --> 05:06:36.580
I had a parent from Oxford approach me with serious concerns regarding Oxford's failure to provide additional services to her children with special needs.

05:06:37.040 --> 05:06:41.382
The parent was given the choice of her child being held back or leaving Oxford.

05:06:43.683 --> 05:06:49.866
As an LEA, Oxford is responsible for providing a continuum of placement in a setting that will meet the individual need of the student.

05:06:50.066 --> 05:06:50.386
Thank you.

05:06:58.140 --> 05:07:03.987
Hello, my name is Grace Park and I'm the Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum Instruction with Chino Valley Unified School District.

05:07:04.628 --> 05:07:12.838
Oxford, also known as OPA, should not be renewed because even after seven and a half years of operation, the school's demographics does not mirror the district's.

05:07:13.499 --> 05:07:22.626
Neighboring schools from OPA have a socioeconomically disadvantaged Latino population that ranges from 85 to 88 percent.

05:07:23.207 --> 05:07:26.029
Oxford, 62.9 percent.

05:07:26.810 --> 05:07:34.055
Even more concerning, English learner enrollment at schools neighboring less than two miles away from OPA ranges from 25 to 43 percent.

05:07:36.537 --> 05:07:39.360
Oxford, 8% are English learners.

05:07:39.961 --> 05:07:46.307
OPA perpetuates a culture of excluding underserved populations and therefore should not be renewed.

05:07:46.587 --> 05:07:46.908
Thank you.

05:07:53.632 --> 05:07:54.273
Good afternoon.

05:07:54.753 --> 05:07:59.640
My name is Liz Pensick and I'm the Director of Business Services with the Chino Valley Unified School District.

05:08:00.220 --> 05:08:04.206
There are a number of reasons why Oxford Preparatory Academy should not be renewed.

05:08:04.666 --> 05:08:08.791
Number one, Oxford's consistent lack of financial transparency.

05:08:09.412 --> 05:08:13.815
Number two, Oxford's failure to meet generally accepted accounting principles.

05:08:14.296 --> 05:08:20.621
And number three, multiple violations of the 2012 fiscal oversight MOU between the district and Oxford.

05:08:21.361 --> 05:08:25.945
Oxford also consistently omits and misstates key financial information in their budgets.

05:08:26.525 --> 05:08:40.169
An example of this occurred as recently as March 24th, 2017, when the district was informed for the first time that on August 31st, 2016, Oxford had entered into a $1 million loan agreement with California Credit Union.

05:08:40.850 --> 05:08:54.294
When asked to explain the $1 million loan agreement at the April 5th, 2017 advisory commission meeting, Oxford could not, and there was obvious confusion amongst their executive team whether it was in fact a loan or a line of credit.

05:08:55.134 --> 05:09:00.468
To these reasons, among others, Oxford should not respectfully be renewed.

05:09:00.588 --> 05:09:00.909
Thank you.

05:09:07.233 --> 05:09:07.833
Good afternoon.

05:09:08.174 --> 05:09:09.174
My name is Sandra Chen.

05:09:09.214 --> 05:09:12.977
I'm the Assistant Superintendent of Business Services for the Chino Valley Unified School District.

05:09:13.538 --> 05:09:18.641
As mentioned previously, our office is responsible for the fiscal oversight of the charter school.

05:09:19.042 --> 05:09:28.268
I would like to bring to your attention that since the FCMAT report was released in November of 2016, our district has had an opportunity to review two more financial reports submitted by OPA.

05:09:29.489 --> 05:09:31.510
I want to bring one point to you today.

05:09:32.350 --> 05:09:43.373
Based on what they submitted for the second interim financial report, OPA went back and recreated their cash flow projection, which was a required document to be submitted with its financial report.

05:09:43.953 --> 05:09:50.055
What happened was they were actual expenses that incurred between the first interim financial and second interim financial.

05:09:50.435 --> 05:09:52.936
However, when we received our second financial report from OPA,

05:09:53.496 --> 05:09:58.180
OPA went back and recreated every single dollar amount which differed from the first period of reporting.

05:09:58.541 --> 05:10:00.663
And that presents a huge concern to our district.

05:10:01.023 --> 05:10:05.647
As such, we request that the board deny the petition appeal.

05:10:05.848 --> 05:10:06.108
Thank you.

05:10:13.069 --> 05:10:15.611
Good afternoon, Board President Kurst, members of the State Board.

05:10:15.711 --> 05:10:16.772
My name is Janelle Rooley.

05:10:16.832 --> 05:10:22.376
I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Young, Mini, and Core, here today urging you to approve this renewal petition.

05:10:23.177 --> 05:10:24.558
I do want to make it very, very clear.

05:10:24.598 --> 05:10:28.701
There's no more sole statutory member structure here with Oxford.

05:10:29.002 --> 05:10:29.782
It doesn't exist.

05:10:29.942 --> 05:10:30.343
It did.

05:10:31.043 --> 05:10:32.064
It does not anymore.

05:10:32.765 --> 05:10:34.526
Not as of July, I'm sorry, June of 2016.

05:10:36.287 --> 05:10:38.989
So ELS, when they said ELS is gone, that's what they mean.

05:10:39.290 --> 05:10:41.892
There's no more sole statutory membership here.

05:10:43.151 --> 05:10:47.717
From the moment that the FGMAT audit was released, Oxford Prep has been in nonstop action mode.

05:10:48.038 --> 05:11:00.594
The entire board was replaced, the entire administration was replaced, the books were turned over to a reputable financial services firm, and all of this work has been double and triple checked by state-recognized auditors.

05:11:01.255 --> 05:11:10.264
I know the CDE didn't think that Oxford could get somebody in enough time after the ACCS meeting to check through the FICMAT report, but they did.

05:11:10.745 --> 05:11:11.626
Oxford got it done.

05:11:11.886 --> 05:11:13.688
We got the final report at 1230 today.

05:11:20.424 --> 05:11:23.326
Good afternoon, Michelle Lynch on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association.

05:11:23.646 --> 05:11:26.267
To continue on what John was saying, they got the final report today.

05:11:26.327 --> 05:11:32.230
You saw a summary in their PowerPoint presentation of the implementation of the concerns of the FCMAT audit.

05:11:32.290 --> 05:11:38.093
The final report came out and says the same thing, that they have gone through many steps in the short time since the FCMAT audit came out.

05:11:38.914 --> 05:11:41.155
I think one of the ECCS commissioners stated it very well.

05:11:41.215 --> 05:11:42.916
We're watching this roll out in real time.

05:11:43.596 --> 05:12:02.053
And in watching it roll out in real time, there might be some messes, there might need to be some clarifications, but they are doing everything they can to ensure that they have turned over the organization, turned over the leadership, terminated relationships with ELS, with Sea Roach, all of the people listed in the FCMAT audit, and do so without disruption to the students because they are serving so many students so well.

05:12:02.213 --> 05:12:04.014
So today we do ask that you approve this renewal.

05:12:04.114 --> 05:12:04.435
Thank you.

05:12:08.663 --> 05:12:09.143
Good afternoon.

05:12:09.383 --> 05:12:12.505
My name is Spencer Stiles, and I'm president and CEO of Trevor Impact.

05:12:13.546 --> 05:12:22.611
As you heard from all of the FCMAT findings, obviously there is the decision to begin working with Oxford Prep starting January of this year was not taken lightly by our firm.

05:12:23.611 --> 05:12:29.475
That being said, I'm very happy to say that with this new management team and with the new board of directors, it's actually been quite a pleasure.

05:12:30.556 --> 05:12:36.140
We've also been, as you've heard, very much scrutinizing the books both historically, current budgets, and prospectively.

05:12:37.161 --> 05:12:48.150
Even our office, in addition to reviewing the school's historical financial statements that were prepared internally, have been audited and are actively being reviewed by two separate and independent CPA firms.

05:12:48.430 --> 05:12:51.252
So, all of which have been very supportive.

05:12:51.712 --> 05:12:57.197
There have been no real material findings and all recommendations made by all external parties have been taken by OPA's board.

05:12:57.937 --> 05:13:01.458
That being said, I am available as follow-up for any financial questions you may have.

05:13:01.478 --> 05:13:01.938
Thanks.

05:13:06.700 --> 05:13:07.340
Good afternoon.

05:13:07.380 --> 05:13:14.222
My name is Deborah Charver, member of the Oxford board and CEO, founder of two successful charter schools in San Bernardino County.

05:13:14.823 --> 05:13:17.603
I also serve as council member of Desert Mountain Selva.

05:13:18.244 --> 05:13:25.146
I accepted my position on the board after seeing the lives of children and families torn apart when they were denied their charter renewal.

05:13:25.979 --> 05:13:36.609
As a board and administration, we have committed ourselves to correcting the mistakes of the past administration and have worked diligently around the clock to fix what was broken.

05:13:37.269 --> 05:13:41.433
We have done everything to make sure this can never happen again, and we guarantee.

05:13:42.762 --> 05:13:50.167
The children and families respectfully ask for a second chance, and it is my prayer that you will grant this to them.

05:13:50.888 --> 05:14:04.877
We are willing to meet any conditions you place upon us, but please, from the bottom of my heart, please allow OPA to continue to operate and give these children the opportunity to remain in the school they love and call home.

05:14:05.358 --> 05:14:05.718
Thank you.

05:14:13.766 --> 05:14:14.326
Good afternoon.

05:14:14.727 --> 05:14:15.868
My name is Naveen Adly.

05:14:16.168 --> 05:14:19.330
I'm OPA Board Treasurer and Chair of the Finance Committee.

05:14:19.891 --> 05:14:27.597
I am here to read to you a letter that we received on May the 4th from the Orange County Board of Education, one of our Orange County authorizers.

05:14:28.758 --> 05:14:34.022
This was addressed to Denise Pascoe, Interim Executive Director, and Andy Stern, Managing Director of Charter Impact.

05:14:34.662 --> 05:14:42.988
Dear Denise and Andy, thank you for your timely submission of the 2016-17 second interim report and accompanying certification.

05:14:43.388 --> 05:14:46.791
We have completed our review and analysis of the second interim report.

05:14:47.191 --> 05:14:54.817
We are pleased to inform you that the school is in good standing to meet all financial obligations

05:14:55.177 --> 05:14:57.898
for current and subsequent two fiscal years.

05:14:58.378 --> 05:15:02.039
The ADA is projected at 585.8 with ADA rate of 98.8%, resulting in projected LCFF funds of $4.6 million.

05:15:02.099 --> 05:15:08.021
Overall review is projected at 5.6 million and overall expenditures are projected at 4.9 million, thus the net profit, 693, 3% of first interim report.

05:15:08.041 --> 05:15:08.302
Thank you.

05:15:26.445 --> 05:15:27.506
Good afternoon, board members.

05:15:27.546 --> 05:15:28.827
My name is Vivian Castro.

05:15:29.107 --> 05:15:31.769
I'm the mother of Eva Sanchez-Castro, a second grader at OPA.

05:15:32.109 --> 05:15:37.653
Before getting into Oxford, my husband and I requested an intra-district transfer for another elementary school.

05:15:38.114 --> 05:15:45.059
When checking on the status of that request with the school district, we were asked, Sanchez-Castro, are you sure you want to transfer to that school?

05:15:45.419 --> 05:15:47.500
It has very high standards and expectations.

05:15:48.141 --> 05:15:53.505
Somehow, my daughter's last name was synonymous with lower achievement, and she'd be better off at a place with lower expectations.

05:15:54.185 --> 05:15:59.330
While at that same school and an activity, a parent asked, oh, you speak to her in Spanish?

05:15:59.670 --> 05:16:01.712
When they heard me talking to my daughter.

05:16:02.232 --> 05:16:05.174
Worried by her tone, my daughter asked, mom, is that bad?

05:16:06.155 --> 05:16:10.439
Thankfully, my daughter's name was called from the OPA waiting list a few weeks later.

05:16:11.079 --> 05:16:19.923
In her three years as a champion, Opa has learned that languages such as Tagalog, Korean, Hindi, Farsi, Spanish, and many other languages are spoken at home and at our school.

05:16:20.344 --> 05:16:25.126
It's a beautifully diverse student body at Oxford where cultural differences are embraced.

05:16:25.606 --> 05:16:26.486
Why do we love Opa?

05:16:26.887 --> 05:16:36.871
In large part because this entire school community knows that every single child is capable of amazing things, each in their own special way, and that diversity is something to be celebrated.

05:16:37.152 --> 05:16:39.573
Please work with us to save this truly exceptional school.

05:16:39.793 --> 05:16:40.073
Thank you.

05:16:47.116 --> 05:16:47.696
Good afternoon.

05:16:47.776 --> 05:16:51.138
My name is Sarah Marenko, and I'm a parent and teacher at Oxford Preparatory Academy.

05:16:51.738 --> 05:16:55.540
We have an ongoing commitment to maintaining a supportive role in our surrounding communities.

05:16:56.100 --> 05:17:04.084
Service learning is embedded in our academic program, and our students, staff, and parents unite to support various philanthropic causes on and off campus.

05:17:04.364 --> 05:17:12.788
In fact, the CDE has recognized OPA's model of community development, and we were honored to receive the 2016 Civic Learning Award from the California Department of Education.

05:17:13.628 --> 05:17:21.393
OPA leadership took the commission's feedback seriously and moved quickly to implement a new procedure in a manner in which only a charter school can do so.

05:17:22.193 --> 05:17:33.620
While OPA looks forward to implementing the National School Lunch Program next fall, our complimentary lunch ticket system is in place now to supply free hot meals to students who lack the resources or simply forget their lunch at home.

05:17:34.500 --> 05:17:49.567
In fact, OPA's meal accommodations stand in stark contrast to CVUSD, who recently informed their families that they would no longer allow students to borrow or charge meals should they have insufficient funds in their account, but would be given a courtesy meal consisting of an unflavored milk and a piece of fruit.

05:17:50.207 --> 05:17:58.111
OPA's meal program disallows this growing epidemic of school lunch shaming in America, and we will continue to improve on existing and new programs to help our students.

05:17:58.491 --> 05:17:58.771
Thank you.

05:18:14.119 --> 05:18:18.301
Good morning, my name is Kevin Diaz and I am a second grader at Oxford.

05:18:18.321 --> 05:18:21.022
I want to share with you why my school is special to me.

05:18:21.642 --> 05:18:26.844
When I was in kindergarten, I did not want to go to school because my teachers would not be patient with me.

05:18:27.864 --> 05:18:31.205
When they got fresh with me, it made me want to quit.

05:18:31.485 --> 05:18:36.307
Then I started going to Oxford and my teachers at Oxford take their time with me.

05:18:36.527 --> 05:18:40.929
Even I have a speech teacher who helps me feel confident when I speak to people.

05:18:41.469 --> 05:18:48.073
My mom drives really far for my brother, sister and me for that we can go to a good school.

05:18:48.614 --> 05:18:51.876
Please don't make me go back to school.

05:18:52.136 --> 05:18:54.877
That made me feel like I want to quit.

05:18:56.539 --> 05:19:07.926
I have friends and teachers that believe and care and who care and believe in me.

05:19:08.226 --> 05:19:08.526
Thank you.

05:19:26.971 --> 05:19:27.311
Hello.

05:19:28.711 --> 05:19:32.433
My name is Ben McNam, and I'm a 2013 graduate from Oxford Preparatory Academy.

05:19:33.193 --> 05:19:41.437
I currently attend Chinoo's High, and I have a sister and two brothers that graduated from OPA right now in college and high school, and they're currently succeeding in what they're doing.

05:19:42.857 --> 05:19:48.680
I believe enrolling in Oxford was a great decision in my life that helped me go into the career I am right now and just helped me succeed in life.

05:19:50.697 --> 05:19:57.783
My time at OPA offered me a wide range of opportunities and experiences, and it got me involved in track, music, and French.

05:19:58.643 --> 05:20:00.405
And these are things I'm doing still today.

05:20:01.405 --> 05:20:04.308
For that, I'm now in a band, and I play at multiple venues.

05:20:04.688 --> 05:20:10.593
I was able to participate in three Junior Olympics representing seven Western states, and I came back from France last winter.

05:20:10.613 --> 05:20:15.937
And with all this, I believe the most important thing about OPA is the teachers and the professors there.

05:20:17.182 --> 05:20:25.144
Because of them, I've had this confidence and I feel like it's a place where you could go and there's people who really care and trust, you could really care about and trust.

05:20:25.925 --> 05:20:36.728
And I just believe that the professors there really care about the kids and I just want to make sure that other kids have the same opportunities and experience that I get to have and just be able to succeed in life and have a great future.

05:20:37.368 --> 05:20:38.148
Thank you for listening.

05:20:39.488 --> 05:20:41.369
I'd like to call some additional speakers.

05:20:41.549 --> 05:20:43.950
Jennifer Fong, Stephanette Graham,

05:20:45.168 --> 05:20:57.980
Lauren Odo, Troy Stephens, Gavin Stephens, Seth Torres, Deanna Campana, Sandra Garner, Nya Brown, Teresa Lewis, Audra Donovan, Lorraine Richards, and Michelle Lynch.

05:21:08.902 --> 05:21:09.923
Good afternoon board members.

05:21:09.983 --> 05:21:16.208
My name is Jennifer Fan and I'm here to tell you a story about my son and my daughter who are both students at Oxford Preparatory Academy.

05:21:16.948 --> 05:21:23.233
I will tell you that our journey to Oxford was one that was a little difficult because my son is a special needs student.

05:21:23.854 --> 05:21:28.417
We searched through hundreds of schools four different counties looking at venues and programs.

05:21:28.478 --> 05:21:35.943
I spoke with a ton of medical experts and a ton of educational experts all to secure the best education I could for my son.

05:21:36.864 --> 05:21:46.411
So with that being said, I would like you to know that we drive 62 miles each way in order to attend Oxford Preparatory Academy.

05:21:47.411 --> 05:21:50.353
Our IEP team has been smooth and collaborative.

05:21:50.814 --> 05:21:55.497
The special education team is amazing and they work together with us.

05:21:55.557 --> 05:21:59.260
They are not set by a time limit where they have to leave a meeting at 3 o'clock.

05:22:00.060 --> 05:22:01.741
They finish and they get results.

05:22:02.241 --> 05:22:04.122
Dominic is doing extremely well.

05:22:05.483 --> 05:22:08.305
He is you know he has proven results.

05:22:08.345 --> 05:22:10.966
His receptive and expressive language has greatly improved.

05:22:12.447 --> 05:22:23.853
I ask you to please look at the proven results and know that to not renew our school would be a travesty and a devastating thing for not just my son but the over 100 school education students there.

05:22:24.534 --> 05:22:25.474
Please consider that.

05:22:25.494 --> 05:22:27.896
9.5 percent of the students are special ed.

05:22:28.016 --> 05:22:28.316
Thank you.

05:22:36.752 --> 05:22:37.332
Good afternoon.

05:22:37.512 --> 05:22:40.953
My name is Stephanie Graham and I'm an eighth grade teacher at Oxford Preparatory Academy.

05:22:41.573 --> 05:22:46.014
The minute you step on campus at Oxford Prep you can immediately feel the positive school climate.

05:22:46.454 --> 05:22:53.155
There is a diverse population of students and staff who help all help the school emulate aspects of tolerance and respect for everyone.

05:22:54.215 --> 05:22:56.515
At OPA diversity is one thing we all have in common.

05:22:56.896 --> 05:23:01.616
Simply put we are a group that has come together from all different walks of life to accomplish one goal.

05:23:02.317 --> 05:23:04.417
We want to provide the best education for our students.

05:23:05.237 --> 05:23:12.787
If you ask any student on campus what they like about OPA, many of them will say they feel like they can be who they truly are at a school without having to worry about the judgment of others.

05:23:13.508 --> 05:23:20.037
It does not matter your race, ethnicity, gender, language, culture, religion, mental, physical ability, class, or immigration status.

05:23:20.658 --> 05:23:21.699
At OPA we are all one.

05:23:22.120 --> 05:23:29.107
We are a blended family who celebrates each other's differences by having programs like World Language and incorporating International Day into our curriculum.

05:23:29.687 --> 05:23:31.149
This doesn't happen everywhere.

05:23:31.629 --> 05:23:34.913
Our school provides an environment that is not replicated often.

05:23:35.894 --> 05:23:41.099
I ask you today to please keep our school open and show the world of education how valuing differences matters.

05:23:41.299 --> 05:23:41.620
Thank you.

05:23:56.878 --> 05:24:00.382
Hi, my name is Zarda and I'm a second grader at El Paso.

05:24:00.762 --> 05:24:03.985
I'm here because I'm very scared that my school might close down.

05:24:04.045 --> 05:24:05.267
I want to ask you a question.

05:24:05.947 --> 05:24:08.210
If you shut down our school, where will you send us?

05:24:08.730 --> 05:24:11.072
Will you keep us all together or will you break us up?

05:24:12.316 --> 05:24:17.020
I hope you didn't have to be scared like us about your school closing because it's very scary.

05:24:17.761 --> 05:24:23.166
Please don't take away the choice to go to the school I love and to be able to stay with my friends.

05:24:24.427 --> 05:24:29.511
Maybe the school we'll have to go to won't know about Rachel's challenge of kindness we have at Opa.

05:24:30.192 --> 05:24:35.396
Please don't take away my school and make me worry that I'll be bullied like some of my friends who went to other schools.

05:24:36.517 --> 05:24:38.738
I heard someone call us collateral damage.

05:24:39.238 --> 05:24:44.021
Maybe he didn't know he was calling us collateral damage.

05:24:44.681 --> 05:24:48.062
Maybe he didn't know he was being mean and hurting our feelings.

05:24:48.903 --> 05:24:53.605
I really hope he wasn't trying to be mean to us on purpose because we're not just collateral damage.

05:24:54.065 --> 05:24:55.546
We're kids who just love our school.

05:24:56.006 --> 05:24:58.307
Thank you for your time and please please save my school.

05:25:20.612 --> 05:25:21.112
Good afternoon.

05:25:21.132 --> 05:25:23.514
My name is Troy Stevens and I have two boys that attend OPA.

05:25:23.654 --> 05:25:29.639
My youngest son who will speak following me is in a full inclusion program in a mainstream classroom, something we always wanted for him.

05:25:30.160 --> 05:25:39.147
This is the same kid that Chino Valley Unified made an offer of FAPE to five years ago that included busing him 15 miles out of their own district for services they could not provide.

05:25:39.767 --> 05:25:43.750
This is a crazy world we live in and we have to remember we are role models to these kids.

05:25:43.871 --> 05:25:47.994
And as role models, you the board, by promoting today,

05:25:48.976 --> 05:25:55.663
not to approve the school which show these kids that is okay for one person to demolish an entire structure because of what they did.

05:25:55.783 --> 05:25:59.467
These kids should not be punished for what one person did but yet rewarded for never giving up.

05:25:59.967 --> 05:26:05.392
Please show these kids that there are still a lot of good in this world and still good things happen to good people.

05:26:05.953 --> 05:26:06.413
Believe in

05:26:07.671 --> 05:26:09.132
Still a lot of good things happen to good people.

05:26:09.212 --> 05:26:11.154
Believe me when I tell you these are great people.

05:26:11.654 --> 05:26:13.656
Just look at the faces of the few kids that are here today.

05:26:13.896 --> 05:26:16.018
Imagine and imagine the hundred back at home.

05:26:16.479 --> 05:26:19.521
Now ask yourself before you vote, what if these were your children?

05:26:19.921 --> 05:26:22.003
Wouldn't you fight for what's right and what you believe in?

05:26:22.384 --> 05:26:27.568
Believe me, I wouldn't be standing here today if I didn't believe in what these people behind me have done to make our school great.

05:26:28.289 --> 05:26:31.671
There would be no greater reward than to reward these kids with five more years.

05:26:33.073 --> 05:26:33.373
Thank you.

05:26:41.277 --> 05:26:43.819
He's going to read Braille, so you might need a little more than that.

05:26:48.964 --> 05:26:49.604
Good afternoon.

05:26:49.664 --> 05:26:52.547
My name is Gavin Stevens, and I am in second grade.

05:26:53.528 --> 05:26:57.411
When my older brother started here at Alba, I knew I wanted to go there, too.

05:26:58.592 --> 05:27:01.214
I was so happy when I started kindergarten.

05:27:01.515 --> 05:27:04.257
I couldn't wait to play on the swings and start my cane training.

05:27:08.234 --> 05:27:10.956
I couldn't wait to put it on the screen, sorry.

05:27:12.377 --> 05:27:12.717
Sorry.

05:27:13.317 --> 05:27:16.139
Opa teaches me braille inside my class.

05:27:16.319 --> 05:27:18.861
I don't go to another class to learn braille.

05:27:20.301 --> 05:27:25.104
God makes us all different, and I think he made this school for me.

05:27:28.126 --> 05:27:32.729
I don't want, if you close Opa, I will lose everything I love.

05:27:33.670 --> 05:27:37.192
If you close Opa, you will ruin my life and hurt my heart.

05:27:39.065 --> 05:27:42.297
I never made bad choices, so please don't punish me for what I did.

05:27:43.101 --> 05:27:43.442
Thank you.

05:27:58.888 --> 05:28:00.369
Hello my name is Seth Torres.

05:28:00.469 --> 05:28:03.491
I'm the ASP president and eighth grader at Oxford Preparatory Academy.

05:28:03.931 --> 05:28:06.653
I have an IEP for my special ability abilities.

05:28:07.013 --> 05:28:09.315
The teachers at OPA adapt to the way the students learn.

05:28:09.615 --> 05:28:12.237
This makes a huge difference especially with students like myself.

05:28:12.677 --> 05:28:16.940
They have given me the tools and confidence to overcome the many obstacles I face each day.

05:28:17.340 --> 05:28:21.723
I'm thankful for the teachers at our school that I've always seen my potential and never given up on me.

05:28:22.144 --> 05:28:24.045
My little sister Jada also attends OPA.

05:28:24.345 --> 05:28:25.226
She's in the fourth grade.

05:28:25.586 --> 05:28:28.628
Please don't close our school because I don't know where my sister will go.

05:28:29.088 --> 05:28:31.889
As a backup plan to OPA, she was registered at the neighborhood school.

05:28:32.370 --> 05:28:36.972
Yet we have been told the school is overcrowded and if there is no room, she will have to be bused to another school.

05:28:37.432 --> 05:28:41.614
Jayda asked the other day if the other school will have Chinese, science lab, chess club, and cheer.

05:28:41.954 --> 05:28:44.175
The answer to her questions was no, they don't.

05:28:44.835 --> 05:28:47.316
Jada is activating these classes and activities at OPA.

05:28:47.737 --> 05:28:49.998
Jada does not want to go to another school but OPA.

05:28:50.378 --> 05:28:51.098
I don't blame her.

05:28:51.259 --> 05:28:51.839
I wouldn't either.

05:28:52.279 --> 05:28:55.761
No other school in the district provides what OPA provides to our students.

05:28:56.221 --> 05:28:59.083
I would love for her to become fluent in Chinese over the next several years.

05:28:59.563 --> 05:29:00.824
We need OPA to stay open.

05:29:01.164 --> 05:29:05.406
Not for me because I have had the chance to go through the program for the past seven years.

05:29:06.087 --> 05:29:11.530
But for the kids like my sister who want the opportunity to continue participating in these classes and activity.

05:29:12.250 --> 05:29:13.935
OPA has prepared me well for high school.

05:29:14.015 --> 05:29:18.827
I ask you to please give our younger students the same opportunities that I have had and vote for approval.

05:29:19.007 --> 05:29:19.288
Thank you.

05:29:33.447 --> 05:29:36.768
My name is Deanna Campagna and I've been a teacher for 28 years.

05:29:37.648 --> 05:29:39.509
I'm here to represent the teachers of OPA.

05:29:39.689 --> 05:29:44.490
Despite everything that has happened, the teachers have continued to do what we do best, teach our children.

05:29:44.770 --> 05:29:47.251
The children are and always have been our priority.

05:29:47.631 --> 05:29:52.672
Even though our world is falling apart around us, we continue to educate, protect, and love our students.

05:29:53.192 --> 05:29:59.813
Given the reality of what is going on, one might expect that the teachers would leave mid-year for the stability of another job.

05:30:00.053 --> 05:30:01.713
Not one teacher has left.

05:30:02.294 --> 05:30:04.954
The school has continued to thrive despite everything.

05:30:05.254 --> 05:30:07.234
There is no doubt that bad things did happen.

05:30:07.754 --> 05:30:09.655
What was wrong has been corrected.

05:30:09.975 --> 05:30:15.376
I cannot understand how the innocent children and the teachers continue to be punished for the acts of one individual.

05:30:15.676 --> 05:30:19.617
When all is said and done, is this the life lesson that we want our children to learn?

05:30:19.797 --> 05:30:20.337
I hope not.

05:30:20.437 --> 05:30:22.337
I pray that our children learn that if they are

05:30:22.657 --> 05:30:28.219
Honest, correct their mistakes and work hard and do the right thing, OPA, they will succeed.

05:30:28.719 --> 05:30:30.359
OPA is not an individual.

05:30:30.919 --> 05:30:38.342
OPA is a program with over 100 faculty and staff, 780 families and over 1,200 children.

05:30:38.502 --> 05:30:41.082
Please do not punish us for the sins of one.

05:30:42.523 --> 05:30:42.823
Thank you.

05:30:49.991 --> 05:30:53.854
Good afternoon, Lorraine Richards on behalf of California Teachers Association.

05:30:54.654 --> 05:31:02.740
CTA is opposed to the petition but mostly for the two reasons of local control by the district and understanding what all those students need as services.

05:31:03.240 --> 05:31:09.885
Secondly is the plan of fiscal responsibility which is public funds that is a byproduct of this charter.

05:31:10.405 --> 05:31:20.151
The other piece is we've heard a kind of a familiar theme here with servicing of students, but also the financial piece that goes along with the responsibility.

05:31:20.211 --> 05:31:30.278
So there is a lot of hard work that goes in on behalf of the students and the teachers, but there is also that second piece of financial responsibility to make sure that they continue to get those services.

05:31:30.538 --> 05:31:30.778
Thank you.

05:31:37.421 --> 05:31:40.662
Hello, I'm Sandra Garner, Vice Chair of the OPA Board.

05:31:41.422 --> 05:31:46.624
When the FCMAP audit was released, two authorizers ran toward the problem, one ran away.

05:31:47.284 --> 05:31:49.885
Capistrano and Orange County never turned their backs on us.

05:31:50.445 --> 05:31:51.965
They knew their students were thriving.

05:31:52.305 --> 05:31:53.286
They wanted to help.

05:31:53.786 --> 05:32:01.168
They answer questions, they give advice, they provide guidance, and that's why our Orange County schools are going to remain open.

05:32:02.228 --> 05:32:03.489
With Chino, it's different.

05:32:03.949 --> 05:32:09.753
When the district met with our parents in December, we were told there was nothing Oxford could do to save the school.

05:32:10.354 --> 05:32:10.734
Nothing.

05:32:11.554 --> 05:32:13.736
We hadn't even implemented one reform.

05:32:14.576 --> 05:32:15.517
Their minds were made up.

05:32:16.077 --> 05:32:20.921
It didn't matter what we did or how we did it, the district wasn't going to give us a chance to succeed.

05:32:21.601 --> 05:32:23.703
We teach our children that redemption is possible.

05:32:24.143 --> 05:32:28.146
If you do something wrong, you accept responsibility, you fix it, you move on.

05:32:28.966 --> 05:32:30.647
But Chino refuses to move on.

05:32:31.368 --> 05:32:35.210
Unfortunately, they can't look at us without seeing Sue Roach.

05:32:36.251 --> 05:32:37.411
But we're not the past.

05:32:37.852 --> 05:32:39.152
We're absolutely the future.

05:32:39.733 --> 05:32:44.315
That's why we are grateful to be here today with fresh eyes to look at the truth.

05:32:44.756 --> 05:32:45.076
Thank you.

05:32:55.279 --> 05:33:02.062
Hi my name is Nala Brown and I would like to share my story when my mom took me out of OPA and put me into a new school.

05:33:02.642 --> 05:33:04.383
My teacher was very mean.

05:33:05.323 --> 05:33:06.944
She didn't even know my name.

05:33:07.144 --> 05:33:09.005
All she said was just number 29.

05:33:09.385 --> 05:33:11.025
I felt like I was invisible.

05:33:11.145 --> 05:33:15.647
Sometimes I'll go to the bathroom when I really didn't have to and just cry.

05:33:17.468 --> 05:33:17.908
My tea.

05:33:18.608 --> 05:33:20.629
I really like my OPA teachers.

05:33:22.170 --> 05:33:24.651
They make learning so fun.

05:33:26.644 --> 05:33:28.888
Like Mr. Raven, he makes music fun.

05:33:28.948 --> 05:33:29.369
Like Ms.

05:33:29.409 --> 05:33:31.774
Provenzano, she makes learning fun.

05:33:32.034 --> 05:33:38.887
Please don't close my school down because I don't want my friends to go through what I went through.

05:33:49.423 --> 05:33:55.025
Hello, my name is Teresa Brown, and I have two daughters that reintegrated back into OPA two months ago.

05:33:55.685 --> 05:34:02.107
After being betrayed by our school founder and feeling pressure from the Chino superintendent, we transferred out of OPA.

05:34:02.527 --> 05:34:04.228
We felt that this was our only choice.

05:34:04.408 --> 05:34:12.871
After all, the superintendent had made it quite clear he had no intentions in working with our school, even though year after year we ranked number one in San Bernardino County.

05:34:13.351 --> 05:34:18.633
While attending a new school, I was approached by parents daily asking how they can get their kids into OPA.

05:34:19.134 --> 05:34:23.576
And this made me realize that we had something special and that I had made a mistake.

05:34:23.996 --> 05:34:24.656
Because you know what?

05:34:24.796 --> 05:34:27.718
OPA has the most kind, hardworking staff you'll ever meet.

05:34:27.998 --> 05:34:32.940
And the second you walk into the office, you're not greeted by an employee, you're greeted by family.

05:34:33.460 --> 05:34:38.102
OPA Pride not only connects us, it allows us to learn and believe in something bigger than ourselves.

05:34:38.542 --> 05:34:39.703
Our school has value.

05:34:40.023 --> 05:34:46.766
It's our home, our contribution to the betterment of not only our city, county, and state, but to society itself.

05:34:47.266 --> 05:34:54.009
So I humbly ask you today to take us under your wings and vote yes for our dynamic school.

05:34:54.309 --> 05:34:59.231
You see, OPA's motto is always a champion, forever a champion.

05:35:06.814 --> 05:35:08.575
Eric Premack, Charter Schools Development Center.

05:35:08.715 --> 05:35:20.804
We were originally somewhat skeptical given the severity of the allegations here, but have been very impressed by the dramatic turnaround with the complete purging of the board, complete turnover of all the executive staff, etc.

05:35:21.244 --> 05:35:27.089
We think they've taken all of the steps necessary to correct the actions that needed to be corrected.

05:35:27.790 --> 05:35:29.713
We've also gotten to know the new management.

05:35:30.314 --> 05:35:40.213
They've participated in our painfully rigorous charter business officer training program, have hired two external audit firms that we had suggested to look at their

05:35:41.576 --> 05:35:43.778
ongoing transactions from two different directions.

05:35:44.138 --> 05:35:50.442
And we can't imagine what more they could possibly do to make right.

05:35:51.283 --> 05:35:54.265
We've been to both or to two of their schools.

05:35:54.685 --> 05:35:58.308
The school culture is very tight, very intense and incredibly supportive.

05:35:58.408 --> 05:36:00.289
And we urge you to grant the appeal.

05:36:00.389 --> 05:36:00.729
Thank you.

05:36:02.791 --> 05:36:04.452
That ends the public comment.

05:36:04.732 --> 05:36:10.416
And so we're ready now for board member discussion.

05:36:12.227 --> 05:36:12.959
Eileen Strauss.

05:36:13.772 --> 05:36:19.296
So I'm interested from the Chino Valley team, just a question.

05:36:19.316 --> 05:36:26.040
I don't know if you will be able to answer my questions, but I've heard anywhere from 989 to 1200 students.

05:36:26.080 --> 05:36:32.284
But I also heard a family story of driving 62 miles and that they take from three counties.

05:36:32.385 --> 05:36:37.328
So my question is, obviously, this is really serious and egregious behavior.

05:36:37.428 --> 05:36:40.590
And we've clearly heard the teams tried to turn it around.

05:36:40.630 --> 05:36:43.292
But this should the school close?

05:36:44.172 --> 05:36:46.713
What options has Chino Valley considered?

05:36:47.153 --> 05:36:52.115
And I don't know how much of the student body is your resident, are your resident students and how many come from neighbors?

05:36:52.195 --> 05:36:57.957
I'm just thinking that since this is May, you may have already thought about the options for all the students who are there.

05:36:58.077 --> 05:36:59.537
And I'd be interested in hearing that.

05:37:00.217 --> 05:37:00.817
Yes, ma'am.

05:37:01.438 --> 05:37:04.619
As you heard, we have taken transfers this year.

05:37:04.639 --> 05:37:07.680
We're planning for the 449 transfers next year.

05:37:08.140 --> 05:37:10.380
I believe my superintendent can speak to that.

05:37:10.400 --> 05:37:12.121
Mr. Joseph, please.

05:37:18.590 --> 05:37:19.211
Good afternoon.

05:37:19.271 --> 05:37:25.815
I'm Wayne Joseph, and we have 20 elementary schools, K-6, and we have two K-8 schools.

05:37:26.356 --> 05:37:31.119
So we have more than enough room to accommodate the OPA students and parents.

05:37:31.219 --> 05:37:35.222
Now, we may not be able to give them the school they want.

05:37:35.342 --> 05:37:38.824
Let's say if they live, if they're living in one area, they may want another school.

05:37:39.185 --> 05:37:45.549
You know, that school may be full, but we surely have enough schools to be able to accommodate all of their population.

05:37:49.544 --> 05:37:51.145
Other board, Ortiz-Lacon?

05:37:54.106 --> 05:37:56.147
This question is actually for the petitioner.

05:37:56.167 --> 05:37:57.168
Yes, ma'am.

05:37:58.529 --> 05:37:58.949
Thank you.

05:37:59.469 --> 05:38:08.934
So I'm looking at the structure and I want to say that I think you've made all the changes you possibly can and I think that the presentation has clearly walked us through that.

05:38:09.314 --> 05:38:11.775
But I still have a question about the current governance.

05:38:12.395 --> 05:38:17.698
So the OPA board of directors oversees the three schools in the three different districts?

05:38:18.464 --> 05:38:18.644
Yes.

05:38:19.405 --> 05:38:25.490
And the executive director and the managing director are the same for the three schools across the three districts?

05:38:25.851 --> 05:38:26.231
Yes, ma'am.

05:38:26.831 --> 05:38:41.705
Now, the financial management team, which is your independent team that is looking at your forensic files and going through all that, the finances, if renewed, how long are you committed to having them as your external reviewer?

05:38:43.226 --> 05:38:50.669
this team, the financial management, because I'm assuming that if you get renewed, there may still be things that come up.

05:38:51.350 --> 05:38:53.371
It sounds like there is that possibility.

05:38:53.731 --> 05:38:55.672
So what is your commitment to keeping them on?

05:38:56.052 --> 05:38:58.814
So currently, we have Charter Impact as our financial management team.

05:38:58.854 --> 05:39:02.275
But in terms of the second audit firm, we have Gilbert Associates.

05:39:02.856 --> 05:39:06.978
And that's a monthly review of our finances through the 17-18 school year.

05:39:07.398 --> 05:39:08.499
That's our current contract.

05:39:09.919 --> 05:39:14.982
In terms of transparency and creating trust, we're more than willing to continue that on past the 17-18 school year.

05:39:17.483 --> 05:39:20.505
I'd like to ask Mr. Fine to come up again from FCMAT.

05:39:29.426 --> 05:39:37.754
So I think we've heard claims that they're in good financial order in some ways and budgets are balancing and so on.

05:39:37.794 --> 05:39:45.641
But how can that be if we don't know what the charges are from ELS and what some of the unknowns were when you audited them?

05:39:46.382 --> 05:39:52.488
I don't see how they can put in their budget things that are unknown that are still pending with ELS.

05:39:55.327 --> 05:40:01.270
Dr. Kirse, I think that's an excellent question and would encourage you to ask the petitioners that.

05:40:01.390 --> 05:40:07.754
Because what we know about the organization is up to the date of our report.

05:40:08.294 --> 05:40:13.577
And we are very confident in our findings and our report and the work that we did there.

05:40:14.457 --> 05:40:17.958
What has transpired since that point, we have not been involved.

05:40:18.539 --> 05:40:25.521
In fairness to them, they have actually, they reached out to us to say, would you be part of our cleanup partner?

05:40:26.601 --> 05:40:31.283
That's obviously a role that we do on a very frequent basis in school districts and charter schools.

05:40:31.343 --> 05:40:40.085
But in this case, there are multiple active follow-up investigations going on of which we are

05:40:44.672 --> 05:40:50.837
part of those conversations and so to avoid a conflict of interest, we've declined.

05:40:52.258 --> 05:41:05.768
But with respect to what ELS may owe them, as you heard earlier from the petitioners they have, and they can speak this far clearer than I can, they have current litigation going on in an attempt to recover that.

05:41:05.828 --> 05:41:07.089
They've done some forensic

05:41:08.160 --> 05:41:12.042
whatever that really means, audit work to identify some of that.

05:41:12.062 --> 05:41:16.983
So I think they're in a better position, sir, to probably answer that question.

05:41:17.464 --> 05:41:20.845
Can you comment on these investigations that are going on?

05:41:21.265 --> 05:41:25.907
Do you know of any of them or are those past your period?

05:41:27.523 --> 05:41:42.035
So very common when we do an AB 139 extraordinary audit and if we reach the threshold where we believe there's sufficient evidence to say something, as the board's aware, the county superintendent has a responsibility to notify local law enforcement.

05:41:45.160 --> 05:41:52.327
Most of the time then we provide support to those, to the local district attorney or the state attorney general's office.

05:41:54.269 --> 05:41:58.773
It's becoming more common to also provide that support to the U.S.

05:41:58.833 --> 05:42:07.982
attorney general's office and other federal investigative bodies, all who have an interest.

05:42:08.783 --> 05:42:18.987
In this particular case, given the nature of the findings, there are a number of control agencies that have an interest in what happened.

05:42:19.467 --> 05:42:26.310
And I think it's really important here from my perspective, I'm speaking up to the date of our report, what happened up to that point.

05:42:26.970 --> 05:42:33.252
I cannot speak to the work that has or has not been done up to, you know, since that point.

05:42:35.634 --> 05:42:44.902
there are a number of agencies that have a high level of interest in this particular report and the previous activities.

05:42:46.523 --> 05:42:57.092
Okay, so I'd like to ask then the district people, how do you know, since FCMAT did not know a lot of ELS's expenditures and financial, how do you know?

05:43:00.505 --> 05:43:04.207
I really want to ask the Oxford prep, then I'll ask you.

05:43:04.507 --> 05:43:11.892
Okay, I'll ask you afterwards because I think... How do you know what they did?

05:43:12.952 --> 05:43:18.055
If FCMAT couldn't find out and they didn't get any information, how did you get the information?

05:43:21.177 --> 05:43:21.457
Pardon?

05:43:23.632 --> 05:43:23.992
Go ahead.

05:43:24.413 --> 05:43:24.933
Good afternoon.

05:43:25.073 --> 05:43:27.195
Brian Hedman from the law firm Theodore Oranger.

05:43:27.235 --> 05:43:31.439
We've been retained by Oxford to pursue litigation against Ed Leighton and Sue Roach.

05:43:32.360 --> 05:43:39.687
I think what you're referring to is the ongoing litigation process and the discovery process through that litigation, which we will be undergoing.

05:43:40.147 --> 05:43:45.191
So the school is aggressively pursuing recovery of funds from Ed Leighton and Sue Roach.

05:43:45.532 --> 05:43:49.696
When that discovery process begins, we will be demanding documents from Ed Leighton.

05:43:50.376 --> 05:43:52.619
And we want those documents as much as anyone.

05:43:53.059 --> 05:43:55.622
And once Discovery opens, we will be demanding them.

05:43:57.918 --> 05:43:58.418
They don't have.

05:43:58.478 --> 05:44:03.843
So, you know, we have a list on page 22, 23 of the audit.

05:44:03.863 --> 05:44:08.466
So you don't have payroll taxes and all these things that they enumerate.

05:44:08.547 --> 05:44:10.328
So you're beginning a process.

05:44:10.728 --> 05:44:14.011
So we're proceeding not knowing what's out there with ELS.

05:44:14.051 --> 05:44:14.952
That's my point.

05:44:15.992 --> 05:44:25.200
And you're saying you're working to recover that, but you have no... Those aren't in your financial projections and your financial person can't know those.

05:44:26.636 --> 05:44:30.118
The school's potential recovery from Ed Leighton is unknown.

05:44:30.519 --> 05:44:33.761
However, all of the school's liabilities are absolutely known.

05:44:34.241 --> 05:44:41.146
So when we talk about uncertainty, we're talking about what will the school be able to recover through its litigation from Ed Leighton and Sue Roach.

05:44:41.706 --> 05:44:42.947
That is the only uncertainty.

05:44:43.447 --> 05:44:45.208
Liabilities are not uncertain.

05:44:48.691 --> 05:44:49.071
OK.

05:44:56.112 --> 05:44:56.492
I don't know.

05:44:56.512 --> 05:44:56.632
Okay.

05:44:56.652 --> 05:44:59.433
I'd like Mr. Fine to comment on that at the time of the audit.

05:44:59.794 --> 05:45:08.357
I don't, I don't, I mean, I can't get at, I don't see how you say you know it all and you're just suing somebody to get back reconciliation.

05:45:09.238 --> 05:45:10.959
How do you know that and he didn't know it?

05:45:11.699 --> 05:45:14.260
You got something that he didn't know.

05:45:14.920 --> 05:45:15.561
Is that, go ahead.

05:45:15.581 --> 05:45:16.441
You go, Mr. Fine.

05:45:19.110 --> 05:45:26.400
Dr. Kirsch, I don't want to put words in their mouth, but I think it's fair to say neither of us know all the details at this point.

05:45:26.681 --> 05:45:32.148
What's different about our approach is we ultimately got to a wall and couldn't go further.

05:45:32.569 --> 05:45:35.793
We issued our report based on everything we knew, including

05:45:37.135 --> 05:45:41.818
some additional information relative to ELS that was available to us but not provided by ELS.

05:45:42.318 --> 05:45:46.641
An important standard that we follow in an extraordinary audit or any kind of fraud audit.

05:45:46.661 --> 05:45:50.283
It's a standard of our certified fraud examiners that are on our staff.

05:45:50.944 --> 05:45:52.365
We triangulate information.

05:45:52.865 --> 05:45:58.629
One piece of information is not adequate for us to reach a conclusion to write a report around.

05:45:58.669 --> 05:46:02.031
We look for multiple pieces of information from multiple sources.

05:46:02.912 --> 05:46:05.133
Clearly without ELS cooperating that

05:46:06.574 --> 05:46:08.255
that became problematic.

05:46:08.815 --> 05:46:27.241
I think what I understood and counseled just to say was that they've initiated litigation and so they've initiated the discovery process and a court will ultimately oversee that process and force the other party to produce just as if

05:46:27.941 --> 05:46:38.929
the district attorney or some other law enforcement issues a subpoena, they will ultimately get some of this information which, as I indicated earlier, in part is why we listed.

05:46:40.490 --> 05:46:50.977
The missing information, it was to make it easier to the follow-up parties, in our case law enforcement, to kind of know quickly what to ask for.

05:46:51.818 --> 05:46:52.158
Thank you.

05:46:52.578 --> 05:46:54.520
Chino Valley, do you want to comment on this?

05:47:03.624 --> 05:47:09.932
I think it's important here, Dr. Kirsten, to remember that CDE and FCMAT have said what?

05:47:10.272 --> 05:47:13.696
That they intentionally deceived their own auditor.

05:47:13.716 --> 05:47:18.502
Their own auditor estimated the money that Enlighten had at $900,000.

05:47:21.671 --> 05:47:33.247
And Mr. Fine has said that FCMAT doesn't conclude on one or two pieces of information, but they look at as much information as they can.

05:47:35.723 --> 05:47:42.751
I think that we had a comment earlier about county boards not hearing appeals.

05:47:43.872 --> 05:47:56.265
Oxford's first appeal from our first denial in March was denied or not heard, I should say, by the San Bernardino County Board of Education on the grounds that

05:47:57.253 --> 05:48:04.955
Oxford exiting its sole statutory relationship with Enlighten was a material revision.

05:48:05.215 --> 05:48:08.495
And you can't make a material revision while an appeal is pending before the county board.

05:48:10.276 --> 05:48:20.538
I would also like to add that as superintendent, I could not in good conscience at this time go to my board and say take over Oxford not knowing the unknown liability.

05:48:21.198 --> 05:48:22.358
We don't know what's out there.

05:48:22.918 --> 05:48:25.299
Mr. Fine alluded to the IRS.

05:48:26.044 --> 05:48:27.447
We don't know where that's going to lead.

05:48:27.727 --> 05:48:30.152
We don't know where anything really is going to lead at this point.

05:48:31.815 --> 05:48:32.216
Thank you.

05:48:32.957 --> 05:48:35.102
Board Member Rucker, I think was next on the list.

05:48:36.464 --> 05:48:37.807
My question is for Mr. Fine.

05:48:45.481 --> 05:48:49.405
Okay, so first of all, I do want to thank you for the explanation that you gave.

05:48:49.465 --> 05:48:56.573
It's very rare that I can talk to an accountant or a numbers guy and actually follow the conversation past the first sentence.

05:48:57.113 --> 05:49:03.320
So my question to you is, I understand the, I think, I understand and I will ask the attorney for

05:49:03.980 --> 05:49:05.121
OPA the same question.

05:49:05.161 --> 05:49:10.825
I understand that they are going through this discovery to identify what the liabilities are.

05:49:11.285 --> 05:49:20.091
But are they, even if they identify the liabilities, is there any way of knowing that they're going to recover whatever funds that they're able to get?

05:49:20.151 --> 05:49:26.876
In your experience, is that something that's also able to happen that they can be made whole by recovering the funds?

05:49:29.488 --> 05:49:33.190
Member Rucker, I'm not in a position to answer that.

05:49:33.831 --> 05:49:36.632
We really know very little about ELS.

05:49:37.693 --> 05:49:54.043
At the time of our report, and our report reflects this, and the department's staff report reflects this, there was roughly, we believed, about at least a half a million dollars of assets that they were holding.

05:49:54.503 --> 05:49:56.707
that belonged, in our opinion, to OPA.

05:49:58.169 --> 05:50:03.958
Whether those are still in their possession, whether there's additional, we have no way of knowing.

05:50:04.218 --> 05:50:05.120
Okay, thank you.

05:50:05.200 --> 05:50:07.183
And then I'd like to ask a couple of questions to OPA.

05:50:13.055 --> 05:50:19.637
So as you're walking up, I just want to say, you know, during the holiday season, we had a family gathering.

05:50:19.697 --> 05:50:23.858
And one of the people who came for the entertainment was what was called a parlor magician.

05:50:24.258 --> 05:50:25.739
And these are the people who walk over.

05:50:25.799 --> 05:50:29.620
These are performers who walk around groups of folks in the room.

05:50:30.220 --> 05:50:36.830
they're able to perform magic tricks right in front of you rather than at some distance on a stage.

05:50:37.251 --> 05:50:45.122
And the idea behind how they work is, you know, while they purposefully distract you to look in one direction, they complete

05:50:45.603 --> 05:50:46.684
the magic trick itself.

05:50:46.724 --> 05:50:47.484
And you go, wow.

05:50:48.065 --> 05:51:02.516
So while it was very clear that you had a number of people who probably were parlor magicians who did all these horrible, horrible things, the issue in front of us is not whether or not the students at your school like the school.

05:51:02.996 --> 05:51:06.779
And it's not whether or not the school itself is performing.

05:51:07.219 --> 05:51:10.061
The issue is what the adults forgot to do.

05:51:10.842 --> 05:51:16.644
And so the question I have for you is really a rephrasing of what our board president has asked.

05:51:16.664 --> 05:51:22.767
You identified that during the lawsuit, during the course of your discovery, you believe you will find out some things.

05:51:23.187 --> 05:51:32.711
The FCMAT report enumerated a number of items that only the former entity, ELS, actually has information on.

05:51:33.251 --> 05:51:38.735
And so you're relying on the idea that through this discovery, you will find out this information.

05:51:39.135 --> 05:51:51.724
And you, what is your basis for believing you're going to fully recover all of those liabilities if you really can't enumerate what exactly each of those numbers are that's in the FITMAT report that's not known right now?

05:51:53.426 --> 05:51:54.366
So thank you for your question.

05:51:56.178 --> 05:52:00.000
This is a common circumstance with all civil litigation.

05:52:00.420 --> 05:52:10.484
A litigant files a lawsuit based on the pleading standard in California and we then discover, we enter the discovery process and we learn and we propel our claims forward.

05:52:10.905 --> 05:52:16.127
So, what OPA is doing here is exactly the same as what occurs in other civil litigation.

05:52:16.587 --> 05:52:18.888
The discovery process is robust in California.

05:52:19.228 --> 05:52:24.349
We have substantial rights to discover and to demand documents, depositions.

05:52:24.589 --> 05:52:28.690
We have subpoena power, and we will exhaust those opportunities.

05:52:29.111 --> 05:52:36.673
We are going to demand the books and records of Enlightened so that we can feel confident that we understand exactly what we are owed.

05:52:37.253 --> 05:52:40.734
We have an idea, and the FCMAT report gave us a good framework.

05:52:41.633 --> 05:52:46.518
But the discovery process compels a lot more information than FCMAT was able to.

05:52:46.818 --> 05:52:47.078
Okay.

05:52:47.298 --> 05:52:52.283
And so I just want to say, the word discovery is a legal term of art.

05:52:52.663 --> 05:52:57.148
Not like Columbus discovered America, he bumped into an island and he didn't know it was there.

05:52:57.488 --> 05:52:59.570
That's not what you mean when you say discovery.

05:52:59.730 --> 05:53:01.492
Discovery is really an inquiry, right?

05:53:01.872 --> 05:53:06.335
It's a formal investigation that is empowered by our civil litigation system.

05:53:06.415 --> 05:53:13.040
It's got the power to demand documents, whereas FCMAT only had the power with regard to Ed Leighton to request.

05:53:13.460 --> 05:53:16.923
We're at a stage in the litigation when we get there, we get to demand them.

05:53:17.063 --> 05:53:24.268
And if Ed Leighton continues to refuse to produce them, we then go to the court and we seek the court's order that Ed Leighton produce them.

05:53:24.508 --> 05:53:32.973
And the reason why I'm asking that is because the impression that you gave me, and I'm overstating the impression because I really do want you to correct me.

05:53:33.513 --> 05:53:40.957
The impression that you gave me is that in the process of discovery, you already know what you're going to find.

05:53:41.257 --> 05:53:42.097
Is that correct?

05:53:42.598 --> 05:53:44.018
No, that is not correct.

05:53:44.098 --> 05:53:46.760
What we do know is what we're looking for.

05:53:47.080 --> 05:54:00.613
Okay, do you already, as it relates to each of the items that FCMAT has enumerated that cannot be determined, do you have an idea or an estimate of what those dollar amounts are?

05:54:01.929 --> 05:54:07.430
whatever we discover through this litigation and recover will just be added to the school's reserve.

05:54:07.930 --> 05:54:12.151
Okay, but you're talking only about recovering dollar reserves.

05:54:12.571 --> 05:54:19.132
We're still talking about obligations as well that were identified by FCMAT that cannot be known.

05:54:19.552 --> 05:54:29.634
So my question is, there's two types of, there's two sets of pieces of information that seem to not be clear to us that you understand.

05:54:30.174 --> 05:54:43.238
that there's obligations that were identified by FCMAT that are currently not known and there's money or assets that the company seems to be holding that you're seeking to recover.

05:54:43.638 --> 05:54:51.140
Are you only filing a lawsuit to recover the assets or are you also doing discovery to identify any other obligations?

05:54:52.011 --> 05:54:55.675
We are seeking discovery of what Oxford Prep is owed.

05:54:56.215 --> 05:54:59.598
Oxford Prep already has a firm understanding of all of its liabilities.

05:54:59.638 --> 05:55:02.281
And I would turn that discussion over to Charter Impact.

05:55:02.661 --> 05:55:11.370
But through our litigation, we will be seeking the discovery of information regarding what additional funds Oxford can recover from at Leighton.

05:55:12.122 --> 05:55:16.386
It is not an inquiry into unknown liabilities because there are not unknown liabilities.

05:55:16.446 --> 05:55:26.595
Well, that's the point that our board president made that if FCMAT says that there's some unknown liabilities, there's a difference in perception about what you say that there are no unknown liabilities.

05:55:26.675 --> 05:55:29.758
And FCMAT is saying that there are some unknown liabilities.

05:55:29.798 --> 05:55:30.659
That's my concern.

05:55:32.591 --> 05:55:43.964
I think that the thrust of your inquiry goes to all of the investigation internally at OPA that has happened since FICMAT, hundreds of hours of time piling through the books and records.

05:55:44.205 --> 05:55:48.530
But the OPA is very confident that it understands the totality of its obligations.

05:55:48.730 --> 05:55:49.351
OK, thank you.

05:55:51.810 --> 05:55:52.531
Yeah, I have.

05:55:52.711 --> 05:55:53.091
Go ahead.

05:55:53.191 --> 05:55:53.732
Yeah, Bruce.

05:55:54.192 --> 05:55:55.473
Next.

05:55:55.593 --> 05:55:57.354
Before you leave and then Mr. Fein.

05:55:59.016 --> 05:56:07.342
So you have confidence that you are not going to find in this discovery process any further obligations for OPA.

05:56:08.003 --> 05:56:08.383
I'm sorry.

05:56:12.646 --> 05:56:13.787
I'll rephrase my question.

05:56:16.821 --> 05:56:25.404
When you do this discovery process, when the ESL books are open, it's your opinion that you will not find any further obligations.

05:56:25.464 --> 05:56:26.024
Is that correct?

05:56:27.504 --> 05:56:37.668
When we get a look at Leighton's books and records, they will reflect what money could be owed to OPA and potentially reflect what money Ed Leighton owes to others.

05:56:38.608 --> 05:56:45.050
Ed Leighton's books and records, though, should not and will not shed light on any new liabilities on behalf of Oxford PrEP.

05:56:45.993 --> 05:57:01.479
And so during this time period after the FICMAT report and through all the hundreds of hours that you just said, you have scoured your books, you've looked through, you know, this mention of a million-dollar loan that was taken out and these other things.

05:57:02.540 --> 05:57:03.980
You've got all of that in hand.

05:57:04.020 --> 05:57:11.403
You know exactly what your liabilities are at this point, and you know what your reserve is, what's in the bank right now today that you can write a check on.

05:57:11.844 --> 05:57:13.404
Those things you are very clear about.

05:57:13.464 --> 05:57:14.045
Is that correct?

05:57:14.525 --> 05:57:15.025
Crystal clear.

05:57:15.677 --> 05:57:16.877
So, thank you very much.

05:57:17.418 --> 05:57:19.698
Mr. Fine may want to comment on that.

05:57:19.778 --> 05:57:20.399
I was calling him.

05:57:24.180 --> 05:57:25.581
Sir, thanks for coming back up.

05:57:26.961 --> 05:57:43.327
So, are you aware of, at the end of the FICMET report, did you have a sense that there were outstanding liabilities that potentially could impact this organization?

05:57:45.717 --> 05:57:56.424
Member Holliday, I think it's important to put where the very first question Dr. Kearse asked with respect to this list of items on page 22 and 23.

05:57:57.225 --> 05:58:03.930
Those are revenue and expenditure items that were filed as part of ELS's tax return and an amended tax return.

05:58:05.350 --> 05:58:14.073
They really don't speak specifically to assets and liabilities per se, although in that same tax return are assets and liabilities.

05:58:14.113 --> 05:58:25.237
But this list, our expenditure items and what we were looking for in concert with our scope was money that was transferred from a public charter school to Enlighten.

05:58:26.977 --> 05:58:28.117
And how was it spent?

05:58:28.338 --> 05:58:35.899
Did it end up back in the pockets of the same people that we had concern about that were part of our scope?

05:58:35.959 --> 05:58:38.280
And so, our focus was on expenditures.

05:58:39.040 --> 05:58:50.963
We believe based on information that we had, there are some cash balances, there are in the filings with the IRS, they clearly say they hold assets for OPA.

05:58:51.603 --> 05:58:53.344
So, that was our focus.

05:58:54.244 --> 05:59:00.469
I'm going to go back though and make sure that you recall our concern in all of this.

05:59:01.470 --> 05:59:07.055
One of our concerns is that ELS and OPA at the time were basically one in the same.

05:59:07.615 --> 05:59:16.803
And so has ELS entered into any obligations that OPA is unaware of and you've heard them speak to that and they're the ones that would know that.

05:59:18.564 --> 05:59:20.425
that somehow bound OPA.

05:59:20.705 --> 05:59:21.686
That would be the unknown.

05:59:21.726 --> 05:59:24.808
That was not something that we were privy to.

05:59:26.749 --> 05:59:27.509
Are you going to continue?

05:59:29.330 --> 05:59:31.171
I want to follow up on this point.

05:59:32.772 --> 05:59:46.420
We're, and I don't know whether you should answer this, Mr. Fine, it may be our lawyers, but in a number of areas, a lot of areas today that I don't get fully grasped, but there's a possibility of criminal charges here.

05:59:47.284 --> 05:59:49.645
Would you say in your experience that's even feasible?

05:59:49.705 --> 06:00:00.892
Because I don't know, maybe... I just want to answer, is there some way the school could be held or sued if there are criminal activities and criminal convictions?

06:00:02.132 --> 06:00:06.255
You know, it seems to me there's at least a chance some of this activity is illegal.

06:00:07.020 --> 06:00:08.761
by the former administration.

06:00:08.961 --> 06:00:10.202
And is that a lie?

06:00:10.982 --> 06:00:14.484
Would that be a potential liability that they cannot account for?

06:00:15.205 --> 06:00:26.971
Often when somebody's convicted, not often, but I've read in the paper, when criminals are convicted, then some people sue behind it, you know, in that regard and sue for various things.

06:00:27.052 --> 06:00:27.232
So,

06:00:28.132 --> 06:00:30.054
Can the legal counsel talk about that?

06:00:30.094 --> 06:00:32.335
I think that's... I think there's just so many unknowns.

06:00:32.515 --> 06:00:36.138
We can't say what any... because everyone's been saying... I'm not saying whether you know it.

06:00:36.198 --> 06:00:37.479
Is it a possibility?

06:00:37.499 --> 06:00:39.240
It probably is a possibility.

06:00:39.260 --> 06:00:49.727
I think we don't know about what any liabilities might come from the board, the former board, not this, the former board that was, you know, approving and had employed Sue Roach.

06:00:51.849 --> 06:00:52.149
Okay.

06:00:52.429 --> 06:00:52.990
Do you have a comment?

06:00:53.010 --> 06:00:53.290
Yeah.

06:00:53.530 --> 06:00:54.711
I would only add to it.

06:00:56.937 --> 06:01:11.947
Again, if it's determined these are all one in the same, that there could potentially be tax, federal and state tax liabilities related to what was established as a not-for-profit corporation that ultimately was determined not to qualify for that.

06:01:12.307 --> 06:01:13.968
As not-for-profit or as for-profit?

06:01:14.129 --> 06:01:19.752
With regard to law enforcement, they certainly are looking at a whole host of penal code sections.

06:01:21.033 --> 06:01:25.236
I couldn't speak to how that flows down to the corporate entity from the individual.

06:01:26.977 --> 06:01:27.497
at this point.

06:01:27.998 --> 06:01:28.778
Yeah.

06:01:28.878 --> 06:01:30.279
I'm not asking in this case.

06:01:30.800 --> 06:01:33.521
Is this even possible within the realm of possibility?

06:01:33.561 --> 06:01:34.542
Nobody knows, I guess.

06:01:34.582 --> 06:01:37.164
But sometimes I've seen that.

06:01:37.284 --> 06:01:41.726
And that's all I want to know is people.

06:01:42.327 --> 06:01:42.587
Yeah.

06:01:43.047 --> 06:01:43.828
Board Member Williams.

06:01:44.868 --> 06:01:48.090
The petitioner and the attorney to the petitioner.

06:01:48.311 --> 06:01:51.412
And is it, who's your capital impact?

06:01:51.453 --> 06:01:52.233
Charter impact?

06:01:52.273 --> 06:01:53.694
Who's, if you'd bring them.

06:02:03.326 --> 06:02:08.708
So back to the question of are all liabilities known?

06:02:10.108 --> 06:02:11.249
And I'm hearing yes.

06:02:11.849 --> 06:02:15.110
But I heard that that capital, is it capital impact?

06:02:15.450 --> 06:02:16.090
Charter impact.

06:02:16.690 --> 06:02:18.711
But I heard that you're the one that would know that.

06:02:20.194 --> 06:02:34.764
So in the context of this discussion, what the attorneys have been talking about in the unknowns is the amount of assets that were transferred from OPA to ELS, which the school is now trying to claw back.

06:02:35.504 --> 06:02:44.287
And so from an accounting and management perspective, typically if somebody owes you money and they don't want to pay it, they're quiet and you don't know about it.

06:02:44.567 --> 06:02:48.569
That's the process that they're going through to try to, the discovery process to claw it back.

06:02:49.309 --> 06:02:58.953
If an organization owes somebody else money, let's say there was another bank loan out there somewhere, usually at some point people are going to start asking for that money and asking for payments.

06:02:59.773 --> 06:03:09.796
In our process, when we've scoured through the books, we found no evidence of that whatsoever, with the exception of the single line of credit that was with California Credit Union, at which point, as of today, has been paid back.

06:03:10.416 --> 06:03:15.357
So there are no other liabilities, long-term liabilities, whatsoever on the Chino books at this point.

06:03:15.877 --> 06:03:20.159
And we're still projecting on ending with a very big fund balance, as well as $780,000 of cash in the bank.

06:03:20.179 --> 06:03:20.259
Okay.

06:03:20.299 --> 06:03:20.699
Thank you.

06:03:27.261 --> 06:03:28.101
Board Member Holliday.

06:03:28.281 --> 06:03:32.062
Well, that is what I've been thinking during this whole process.

06:03:32.122 --> 06:03:42.425
I mean, if there are liabilities, if money is owed out there to somebody, if they haven't been involved in wrongdoing, they're going to raise their hand.

06:03:42.665 --> 06:03:53.708
And certainly by now, they would have raised their hand, especially with all the news and all the information that's been going on and say, wait a sec, guys, you owe me and would have come straight to OPA.

06:03:53.808 --> 06:03:55.349
I can't imagine that they wouldn't do that.

06:03:55.769 --> 06:04:02.292
So I tend to believe that there are no further obligations, loans, liabilities out there.

06:04:02.692 --> 06:04:03.453
I tend to believe that.

06:04:03.813 --> 06:04:08.135
What I'm still wrestling with, and I'm sorry, this is not really a question for you.

06:04:08.495 --> 06:04:10.736
It's more of a question for, I guess, our counsel, Judy.

06:04:10.756 --> 06:04:24.763
I mean, this seems very basic and naive of me, but at the same time, I really am wrestling with, you know, did the school do wrong or did an individual do wrong?

06:04:25.689 --> 06:04:28.571
And I'm still wrestling with that.

06:04:29.072 --> 06:04:52.430
And I need to feel as though whether or not there is an opportunity for an organization, a nonprofit, an institution, a charter school, to have moved away from an individual and still be the charter school.

06:04:52.610 --> 06:04:53.151
You know what I'm saying?

06:04:56.578 --> 06:05:00.520
I think the one thing I haven't heard is any talk about the former board.

06:05:00.560 --> 06:05:16.370
They said they got rid of the former board, but the former board, we haven't heard that the former board did not approve some of the contracts, and it seems that there was a failure of this individual and a failure of the former board, whether it was

06:05:19.841 --> 06:05:36.474
Failure as a there was there was a lack of oversight by the former OPA board clearly So that that seems to be pretty clear because the board is the governance board and accountable for over fiduciary oversight but but

06:05:37.438 --> 06:05:51.220
If we're now talking about an entirely new board and we're talking about new management and in terms of distancing oneself from the, from Sue Roach, you can't distance yourself much more than file a lawsuit against somebody.

06:05:51.561 --> 06:05:54.841
That tends to, you know, the relationship doesn't work well after that.

06:05:55.421 --> 06:06:01.382
So, I'm not sure I feel at this point like there's no obligations.

06:06:01.902 --> 06:06:05.063
There appear to be no unseen obligations.

06:06:06.235 --> 06:06:10.619
What's unknown is whether or not they can recover anything from Sue Roche.

06:06:11.560 --> 06:06:22.249
And I'm not sure what the question, if there's a legal financial question about the former board, like whether they could be, even if they were the focus of some of the

06:06:26.334 --> 06:06:29.959
criminal oversight looking at investigation.

06:06:30.259 --> 06:06:36.547
Even if they were the focus, how are people wondering how it's connected to the current board?

06:06:39.651 --> 06:06:41.614
Board member Rucker, I think was next.

06:06:43.385 --> 06:06:43.685
Okay.

06:06:43.705 --> 06:06:54.129
So, you know, whenever I drive down the street in my old neighborhood and I see these signs that say under new management, you know, I see all the things that they've done to put themselves under new management.

06:06:54.169 --> 06:06:59.651
But what remains is the residual from what was going on with the old management.

06:07:00.131 --> 06:07:08.434
So when I look at the documents and I look at the page 22 and 23, even if you are under new management, those things remain.

06:07:09.274 --> 06:07:24.388
Even if you're under new management, there are some contracts that the previous board entered into for this charter that the new board may or may not be liable for and that remains an unknown.

06:07:24.408 --> 06:07:33.116
There are some obligations that the old board may have created that the new board may or may not be obligated to.

06:07:33.616 --> 06:07:35.357
And that remains an unknown.

06:07:35.818 --> 06:07:43.563
What I have heard is that the new management is actively pursuing recovery of some assets.

06:07:44.044 --> 06:07:58.815
But I have not heard them clearly state, even if they think they know everything that's owed, they did not talk about any continuing or existing obligations that have been created for them

06:07:59.355 --> 06:08:05.960
by the previous management, that was not clearly known and clearly explained by them.

06:08:06.380 --> 06:08:25.052
So I have great concern when I look at the FCMAT report and I look at those two pages and the list of unknowns, those lists of unknowns, while they may have been done by the old management, the new management has to take on responsibility for addressing those obligations.

06:08:25.413 --> 06:08:26.853
And I didn't hear that.

06:08:27.254 --> 06:08:29.035
So I have great concern about that.

06:08:29.716 --> 06:08:30.878
Why did I hear it?

06:08:31.700 --> 06:08:38.912
That when they said they've looked, they've got charter impact, they've looked, they don't have any obligations that they're not aware of.

06:08:39.533 --> 06:08:39.974
Yeah, let's...

06:08:43.143 --> 06:09:11.876
Well, so one thing about unknown obligations, I just want to pick up on from what Mike Fine said, and that has to do with our friends at tax agencies, like the IRS and FTB, that if they were in fact one and the same entity and those tax agencies go, now, oh, you lied on your tax reports, you got a big problem and you have a major financial obligation potentially, which I think is what, and so I kind of want to ask Cindy and Nick,

06:09:12.976 --> 06:09:16.718
about that because we're in an untenable situation.

06:09:16.798 --> 06:09:18.459
Let's put it out there, folks.

06:09:18.999 --> 06:09:28.504
We do not want to do anything to harm these lovely children who are having a fantastic educational experience by their testimony and by the evidence we have.

06:09:29.204 --> 06:09:41.571
But we have a clear-cut case, as evidenced and documented well by FCMAT, of financial mismanagement and potentially fraud, which is a statutory basis to get rid of a charter.

06:09:42.771 --> 06:09:46.674
So we're stuck here with, oh my God, have they actually corrected it?

06:09:46.975 --> 06:09:54.781
And I don't, not that I distrust anything people are saying here about what they've done and they've uncovered, but we don't have that in front of us.

06:09:54.861 --> 06:10:04.029
We still have a recommendation from the department that, and no recommendation from ACCS essentially, that says we're worried about this.

06:10:04.149 --> 06:10:07.532
We don't think there's a potential they won't be financially viable.

06:10:08.112 --> 06:10:17.363
So at the risk of making everybody unhappy, I wonder if a two-month delay in the action on this might actually reveal some things.

06:10:18.143 --> 06:10:27.994
We heard that they just got an audit today at 1230 that might in fact clear all of this up and we'd have the information in front of us on which to make an action.

06:10:28.675 --> 06:10:40.921
Because I, just like we were with Solarity, I am just so struggling with this notion of throwing a bunch of kids out on the street and having them find another school.

06:10:41.841 --> 06:10:44.062
So I just would like to put that out there.

06:10:44.142 --> 06:10:46.703
First, I want Cindy, though, to answer the question.

06:10:46.803 --> 06:10:53.927
Given what we've heard here, which seems like it's a whole bunch of information since you guys actually last did your analysis,

06:10:56.569 --> 06:11:05.577
and submitted the recommendation to us saying, gee, we're worried about loans, we're worried about this, we're worried about undiscovered contracts, lack of valid audit reports.

06:11:06.258 --> 06:11:16.928
If we had a little bit more time to say, in fact, there is additional information that would support one way or the other, we'd ultimately have to make a decision, would that be worth considering?

06:11:23.592 --> 06:11:30.317
I think, and I don't want to put Mike on the spot, but I mean, I know both of the audit firms that they hired.

06:11:30.337 --> 06:11:35.420
And the report I heard just came in, so we haven't seen it.

06:11:37.042 --> 06:11:40.684
I know who that audit firm is, and they're very reliable.

06:11:41.184 --> 06:11:45.588
The issue is FICMAT spent over three months in their work.

06:11:46.048 --> 06:11:48.730
This audit firm spent less than three weeks.

06:11:49.530 --> 06:12:02.717
I don't know, even seeing the report, if the level of work would be able to go in and, I guess, look at what they've done in terms of what FCMAT found.

06:12:02.918 --> 06:12:05.059
I mean, you kind of know my background.

06:12:05.079 --> 06:12:08.661
This audit report is horrific.

06:12:09.321 --> 06:12:11.102
I've read hundreds of audit reports.

06:12:11.222 --> 06:12:12.603
So, I mean, coming from my

06:12:13.923 --> 06:12:15.283
experience and expertise.

06:12:15.804 --> 06:12:22.505
I just, I am skeptical on how quickly, it looks like they've made efforts, but it's just been too short of a time.

06:12:23.085 --> 06:12:29.246
The former CEO just resigned in December and then this new board came in.

06:12:29.466 --> 06:12:36.288
I think what I was kind of agreeing with Mr. Fine is that if there's a consolidation,

06:12:37.168 --> 06:12:41.070
I think, you know, when they're talking about liabilities, yes, they know the school's liabilities.

06:12:41.110 --> 06:12:44.132
We don't know anything about this other organization.

06:12:44.292 --> 06:12:49.815
It's this sort of unknown sort of landmine that could be stepped on.

06:12:49.855 --> 06:12:51.816
And I think that's where we're concerned.

06:12:51.996 --> 06:12:53.237
That's where we're uncomfortable.

06:12:53.377 --> 06:12:54.917
It's in the best interest of the board.

06:12:55.278 --> 06:13:05.263
I think what we don't want to see, what's harder than denying a school and allowing them to open, what's even worse is during the

06:13:05.623 --> 06:13:08.605
term or even mid-year having them to close.

06:13:09.265 --> 06:13:18.530
It's just we've seen that happen through other charters that is worse than not allowing them to move forward because they have time to plan and transition.

06:13:18.951 --> 06:13:22.413
Mid-year closures are just a nightmare for families in the community.

06:13:22.733 --> 06:13:33.499
That's what we want to prevent because we just don't know what's going to happen in the future with all of this sort of a mess with the organizations and the audits and

06:13:34.159 --> 06:13:35.960
who knows out there what other liabilities.

06:13:36.060 --> 06:13:37.980
So I don't think we're comfortable.

06:13:38.140 --> 06:13:41.281
I don't know if there's enough time in two months.

06:13:41.561 --> 06:13:42.961
When does their charter run out?

06:13:43.002 --> 06:13:44.422
I mean, we can't delay forever.

06:13:44.622 --> 06:13:48.143
I'm not sure we can hang on the July agenda with due diligence.

06:13:48.623 --> 06:13:50.223
June 30th is the end of their term.

06:13:50.464 --> 06:13:50.884
Yeah.

06:13:51.044 --> 06:13:54.645
So they would then term out.

06:13:54.725 --> 06:13:55.345
You would want to

06:13:56.152 --> 06:13:56.952
recharter them?

06:13:57.132 --> 06:13:58.272
That would be your proposal?

06:13:58.292 --> 06:14:01.613
No, no, I just wondered whether additional time.

06:14:01.973 --> 06:14:04.414
I wasn't paying attention to the termination date.

06:14:04.814 --> 06:14:22.918
But I do think, I mean, I think the point that Cindy's making is while we've been asking all these questions about what do you know, what do you know, there's still, it's like this big black box of this ELS which FCMAT couldn't get at, they can't get at, they don't know it, and so that's the big

06:14:23.958 --> 06:14:29.719
black cloud, if you will, that's hanging over the school that I think makes it tough for us to move forward.

06:14:30.299 --> 06:14:31.580
Yeah, board member Holliday.

06:14:31.860 --> 06:14:35.680
And the school's in just a terrible situation here because of timing.

06:14:36.981 --> 06:14:47.963
You know, if this happened two years ago or something, I don't know exactly what the timeline would have been, but if it happened earlier, a lot of this would already have come to light and we would have been able to get the facts.

06:14:48.023 --> 06:14:52.224
So, you know, their back's up against the wall and that's a real shame.

06:14:54.864 --> 06:14:55.204
Okay.

06:14:55.304 --> 06:14:56.285
Are we ready?

06:14:56.365 --> 06:14:59.406
I think we're ready for a motion of some sort at this point.

06:15:00.946 --> 06:15:03.247
Do we have a motion?

06:15:03.387 --> 06:15:03.827
Anybody?

06:15:06.688 --> 06:15:09.009
I'm supposed to make a motion, but I'm not going to make it.

06:15:09.850 --> 06:15:10.850
I can't make that motion.

06:15:11.390 --> 06:15:12.851
So somebody else have to make a motion.

06:15:13.231 --> 06:15:14.571
Anybody else want to make a motion?

06:15:18.733 --> 06:15:19.873
We're done.

06:15:21.454 --> 06:15:22.354
Go ahead.

06:15:22.634 --> 06:15:24.115
Anybody else want to make a motion?

06:15:25.871 --> 06:15:26.171
Pardon?

06:15:26.872 --> 06:15:34.695
Yeah, so we can just not, not take action.

06:15:35.536 --> 06:15:37.097
If that's what people want to do.

06:15:38.477 --> 06:15:38.778
Pardon?

06:15:40.839 --> 06:15:43.800
Yes, it would be the same as a denial.

06:15:43.840 --> 06:15:45.981
We should say that to the... I don't know.

06:15:46.181 --> 06:15:47.502
I'm asking for a motion.

06:15:49.963 --> 06:15:50.323
Yeah.

06:15:51.664 --> 06:15:53.445
Do you want to adjourn?

06:15:53.705 --> 06:15:55.286
I mean, adjourn or have a recess?

06:15:57.347 --> 06:15:57.667
Okay.

06:15:58.949 --> 06:16:00.991
Ten minute recess.

06:16:01.011 --> 06:16:02.612
We'll come back at 4.05.

06:16:02.652 --> 06:16:10.760
Thanks, Mr. President.

06:16:11.901 --> 06:16:12.742
Okay.

06:16:12.762 --> 06:16:13.943
The board will reconvene.

06:16:14.904 --> 06:16:16.966
Mr. President, I apologize for the delay.

06:16:17.726 --> 06:16:18.587
I sincerely do.

06:16:18.687 --> 06:16:18.887
I was

06:16:20.825 --> 06:16:34.557
During that recess, I spoke with SBE staff because I needed a handout to be copied and passed out to everyone.

06:16:35.117 --> 06:16:36.479
I did not speak with anyone else.

06:16:39.201 --> 06:16:44.545
This motion that I'm going to make is my motion.

06:16:46.412 --> 06:16:52.019
stemmed from my feelings and my heart and it does not come from anyone else.

06:16:52.921 --> 06:16:57.406
Just make it clear this is my choice in this matter.

06:16:58.728 --> 06:17:04.175
I believe that, pardon me, I believe that this is a

06:17:05.592 --> 06:17:10.136
a group of teachers, parents and kids who are benefiting from this charter school.

06:17:10.757 --> 06:17:23.769
I believe that wrongdoing did take place, but I also believe that there has been an enormous effort to clean house and I trust that that has taken place.

06:17:24.569 --> 06:17:29.014
There may be another shoe that drops down the road.

06:17:30.271 --> 06:17:40.617
I have a feeling that the parents and children of this school would prefer to take that risk than to have this school be closed today.

06:17:41.078 --> 06:17:54.566
And as a result, I would like to move that we as SBE approve the renewal of OPA with the following conditions, and they are lengthy.

06:17:56.218 --> 06:18:02.540
So I asked for all these conditions to be passed to the board members and if you have in written form.

06:18:02.980 --> 06:18:06.142
So if you have questions, you may certainly do so.

06:18:06.922 --> 06:18:09.423
I assume for record I have to read all of these out loud.

06:18:11.103 --> 06:18:11.363
Okay.

06:18:13.064 --> 06:18:13.904
Number one condition.

06:18:13.924 --> 06:18:20.907
OPA will contract with an agency approved by the CDE for a comprehensive management audit

06:18:22.543 --> 06:18:27.705
OPA will provide CDE monthly updates from that auditor on the status of the audit.

06:18:28.285 --> 06:18:35.128
And upon the day of completion, OPA will provide CDE with a copy of the auditor's final comprehensive report.

06:18:35.928 --> 06:18:46.272
Within one month of OPA's receipt of the comprehensive management audit report, OPA will provide CDE with a plan approved by a governing board to resolve any audit findings.

06:18:47.013 --> 06:18:50.594
Upon CDE's request at any point during the term of OPA's charter,

06:18:51.463 --> 06:19:01.509
OPA will contract with an agency approved by CDE to verify that the findings identified in the comprehensive management audit have been and continue to be adequately addressed.

06:19:02.650 --> 06:19:18.440
Condition two, OPA shall disclose to CDE any contracts between OPA and a charter or education management organization and shall obtain prior approval from CDE before entering into or approving the revision of any such contracts.

06:19:19.144 --> 06:19:30.794
Number three, OPA shall disclose to CDE any entities affiliated with OPA and any related party transactions entered into by OPA within the last fiscal year.

06:19:31.555 --> 06:19:41.304
OPA shall obtain prior approval from CDE before entering into any future agreement with any such entity or any other related party transaction.

06:19:42.051 --> 06:19:55.369
Should CDE approve an agreement between OPA and affiliated entity, CDE may also request that OPA obtain prior approval from CDE before any loan or transfer between the entities.

06:19:56.158 --> 06:20:01.721
All OPA affiliated entities shall agree to respond to any inquiries from CDE.

06:20:02.381 --> 06:20:22.851
And number four, OPA will make reasonable efforts to participate in the National School Lunch Program and shall provide CDE with regular updates regarding the status of its application and its outreach efforts to notify all demographic groups within Chena Valley of their right to apply for admission to OPA.

06:20:24.351 --> 06:20:25.232
And that is my motion.

06:20:26.698 --> 06:20:32.984
And with a heart full of gratitude to my colleague, Bruce Holliday, I second that motion.

06:20:35.427 --> 06:20:36.368
Okay.

06:20:36.388 --> 06:20:37.869
Board member discussion of the motion.

06:20:41.573 --> 06:20:42.354
Board member Sandoval.

06:20:44.430 --> 06:20:54.418
I really appreciate the heart, the passion of the educators, the students, the volunteers, the board members of this organization.

06:20:54.898 --> 06:21:01.924
And I also am grateful for this option that's being presented by Member Holiday.

06:21:02.464 --> 06:21:10.511
But I still believe that there are too many unresolved issues that have yet to be addressed, too many unknowns and

06:21:12.352 --> 06:21:24.540
Even with these conditions that are being proposed, I still don't feel like I can support that new or the motion.

06:21:24.560 --> 06:21:26.521
Board Member Rocker.

06:21:29.680 --> 06:21:41.708
like Board Member Sandoval, while this attempts to address a couple of things and the school lunch issue was a very important to me, but I still think that there are too many unresolved fiscal issues.

06:21:42.349 --> 06:21:48.773
I now, if we approve, if the Board approves this appeal, we become their authorizer.

06:21:49.314 --> 06:21:53.357
I'm not even sure if there's now any liability that falls to the Board.

06:21:53.877 --> 06:21:56.379
by being their authorizer that we will inherit.

06:21:56.779 --> 06:22:05.884
And so I don't believe this motion addresses or indemnifies in any way us from those obligations that we don't know about.

06:22:06.364 --> 06:22:08.966
So I remain concerned that as the authorizer,

06:22:09.466 --> 06:22:22.798
we would be inheriting something that through no fault of the parents and the children in this room that become, this becomes our mess if we become their authorizer and this motion doesn't address it.

06:22:22.838 --> 06:22:25.120
And I don't feel I can support this motion either.

06:22:26.802 --> 06:22:34.849
Yeah, I don't see how this audit addresses what CDE talked about that the budget cannot be deemed viable

06:22:36.016 --> 06:22:43.342
due to potential of undiscovered contracts, transactions, taxes, extended liabilities, loans, obligations.

06:22:44.723 --> 06:22:52.929
You can't, if these are, to me there's, to be the authorizer, you would have to have much more than have an audit.

06:22:53.029 --> 06:22:54.830
Audit doesn't solve problems to me.

06:22:54.870 --> 06:23:00.074
You seem to think that it, you know, makes these go away, but I don't quite see that.

06:23:00.154 --> 06:23:00.575
Moreover,

06:23:01.397 --> 06:23:03.178
I think we're getting awfully deep.

06:23:03.418 --> 06:23:08.420
The board has to think about how deeply we want to get involved in running these charters.

06:23:09.221 --> 06:23:10.982
I mean, this has the CDE.

06:23:11.402 --> 06:23:19.746
It's a major policy change for the CDE to be so deeply embedded in all of these, of all of these operations.

06:23:19.966 --> 06:23:24.808
And it seems to be the way we're drifting that we're not only doing oversight.

06:23:24.868 --> 06:23:29.131
We're actually, in effect, an adjunct fiscal agent.

06:23:29.331 --> 06:23:29.751
And so,

06:23:30.751 --> 06:23:36.414
I can personally, I don't see this as appropriate as a motion I can support.

06:23:37.875 --> 06:23:38.715
Any other comments?

06:23:40.716 --> 06:23:40.937
All right.

06:23:40.997 --> 06:23:43.038
Call the roll.

06:23:45.339 --> 06:23:45.999
Bruce Holliday.

06:23:47.320 --> 06:23:48.140
Nikki Sandoval.

06:23:49.381 --> 06:23:50.201
Karen Valdez.

06:23:51.802 --> 06:23:52.843
Olivia Sison.

06:23:54.564 --> 06:23:55.284
Trish Williams.

06:23:56.425 --> 06:23:57.025
Mike Kirst.

06:23:57.345 --> 06:23:58.846
Eileen Strauss.

06:24:00.535 --> 06:24:00.875
Sue Burr?

06:24:00.895 --> 06:24:01.015
No.

06:24:02.656 --> 06:24:03.997
Feliza Ortiz Licon?

06:24:04.097 --> 06:24:04.497
Yes.

06:24:06.538 --> 06:24:07.358
Patricia Rucker?

06:24:07.658 --> 06:24:07.759
No.

06:24:09.579 --> 06:24:09.800
Okay.

06:24:09.840 --> 06:24:10.720
The motion fails.

06:24:11.160 --> 06:24:12.501
There's only four in favor.

06:24:12.961 --> 06:24:15.102
We need another motion.

06:24:20.465 --> 06:24:25.067
We need a... Does anybody want to make another motion?

06:24:31.613 --> 06:24:32.653
Well, that's another motion.

06:24:33.013 --> 06:24:35.054
I don't think we ought to try and amend this motion.

06:24:36.114 --> 06:24:38.775
Unless, you know, one can make a motion to amend it.

06:24:40.736 --> 06:24:41.136
Okay.

06:24:41.236 --> 06:24:45.137
Hearing no other motion, then we have taken no action.

06:24:47.098 --> 06:24:47.398
All right.

06:24:47.458 --> 06:24:52.000
So we're now on to the next charter.

06:24:52.020 --> 06:24:52.000
20.

06:24:55.001 --> 06:24:58.182
New West Charter.

06:24:58.242 --> 06:24:59.222
Hold a public hearing.

06:25:13.516 --> 06:25:16.539
Again, Cindy Chan with the California Department of Education.

06:25:16.619 --> 06:25:21.664
So item 20 is the last of the four renewals that you have before you today.

06:25:22.405 --> 06:25:30.773
It's a request to renew New West Charter, a charter school currently authorized by the state board, with a charter term that expires June 30, 2017.

06:25:34.016 --> 06:25:43.965
Current law requires a State Board of Education authorized charter school seeking renewal to submit a renewal petition to the authority that originally denied the charter.

06:25:44.946 --> 06:25:51.272
New West Charter submitted its renewal petition to the Los Angeles Unified School District, which was denied on December 13th.

06:25:53.274 --> 06:26:04.622
If a school district governing board denies a renewal petition for an SB authorized charter school, current law allows the charter school to submit the renewal petition directly to the state board.

06:26:04.682 --> 06:26:09.806
So in this case, New West did not have to go to Los Angeles County office.

06:26:09.866 --> 06:26:13.389
It can go from the district and then straight back to the state board.

06:26:15.399 --> 06:26:18.000
New West submitted an appeal on December 14th.

06:26:19.200 --> 06:26:39.906
Based on CDE staff's review of the appeal documents, the CDE recommends that the State Board hold a public hearing and thereafter approve with technical amendments in one condition, the request to renew New West's charter under the oversight of the State Board for a five-year term, effective July 1, 2017 through June 30th.

06:26:43.328 --> 06:26:45.770
2021-22.

06:26:46.891 --> 06:26:49.614
The CD's recommendation includes the following condition.

06:26:50.475 --> 06:27:01.766
New West Charter must revise the homeschool agreement and enrollment agreement to remove all language that conflicts with education code section 49011 subdivision B.

06:27:04.508 --> 06:27:20.723
As noted in the CDE's January 20th, 2015 fiscal management advisory 15-01 and also education code section 47605B5H and 47605D2A.

06:27:21.564 --> 06:27:25.107
Revisions to the homeschool agreement and enrollment agreement include

06:27:26.427 --> 06:27:45.354
Clearly indicating that parents are not required to provide any volunteer hours such as participating in school projects, events, and classroom activities, overseeing community service projects, or attending orientation launch meetings, back to school nights, open houses, or school-wide events.

06:27:46.594 --> 06:27:54.177
Removing any language requiring payment of fees for after school athletics, field trips, and rental of musical instruments.

06:27:55.557 --> 06:28:04.101
Removing the traffic monitoring and mitigation policy slash pupil transportation and parking policy from the homeschool agreement.

06:28:05.521 --> 06:28:20.687
And four, removing language that places conditions upon admission and continued enrollment at New West Charter such as mandatory requirements of parents, consequences for noncompliance to the homeschool agreement including loss of enrollment,

06:28:21.428 --> 06:28:29.260
at New West Charter and the requirement that parents and pupils sign the homeschool agreement as a condition of enrollment at New West Charter.

06:28:31.624 --> 06:28:44.129
In addition, the CDE recommends that New West Charter be allowed to include a preference in Element 8 admission requirements so that admission preferences align with Education Code Sections 47605D, 2B, and 47614.5.

06:28:51.252 --> 06:28:55.576
That would be preferences, number one, existing pupils of New West Charter.

06:28:56.116 --> 06:29:13.871
Number two, pupils who currently are currently enrolled in or reside in the attendance area of Brockton Elementary, a public elementary school where New West Charter is located in which 55% or more of the pupil enrollment is eligible for free or reduced price lunch.

06:29:14.791 --> 06:29:17.192
and three, pupils residing in the district.

06:29:17.832 --> 06:29:24.854
Additional preferences beyond these may be permitted by the state board as the chartering authority and only if consistent with the law.

06:29:25.574 --> 06:29:33.116
And the reason why we're allowing this other preference, it is allowed in the statute and it has to do with the charter school facility grant program.

06:29:33.796 --> 06:29:41.138
The counter statute for that program requires this sort of special carve out of the charter school

06:29:42.058 --> 06:29:52.708
of the admissions and so we're allowing that to be added and the charter school is actively a participant in that program.

06:29:54.149 --> 06:29:59.414
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools considered the newest charter renewal petition at its April 5th meeting.

06:30:00.434 --> 06:30:17.381
The ACCS voted to recommend that the State Board approve the CD staff recommendation with a change in enrollment preferences contingent upon the CD staff ensuring that the change in enrollment preferences is compliant with Education Code Section 47605.

06:30:19.962 --> 06:30:22.203
the motion passed by a vote of six to one.

06:30:22.783 --> 06:30:32.485
And I think there was, the discussion on that was the fact that we, in the ACCS item, we didn't acknowledge the other preference.

06:30:32.585 --> 06:30:38.627
I think we didn't realize that that was in there and that they were a participant of the Charter School Facility Grant Program.

06:30:38.647 --> 06:30:45.609
Most of the time you don't see that in the petitions we bring because most charter schools are eligible on their own counts, in this case,

06:30:46.329 --> 06:30:53.152
the charter school has to rely on LAUSD, which is a sort of a plan B for that eligibility program.

06:30:53.772 --> 06:30:57.733
So the discussion was as long as we found it to be compliant, then they would approve that.

06:30:58.654 --> 06:31:03.215
And the votes passed, the vote passed, or the motion passed by a vote of six to one.

06:31:03.236 --> 06:31:09.058
So give you a little bit of background and then what we looked at in terms of this petition.

06:31:10.299 --> 06:31:13.543
In December 2001, the State Board approved the New West petition.

06:31:13.924 --> 06:31:19.211
New West opened in September 2003, serving pupils in grade 6 through grade 8.

06:31:19.992 --> 06:31:22.476
New West Charter was renewed by the State Board in 2007 and again in 2012.

06:31:26.141 --> 06:31:31.004
Beginning in 2012, New West Charter added one high school grade level per year.

06:31:32.025 --> 06:31:43.171
The school currently serves 824 pupils in grade 6 through grade 12 and is proposing to expand by adding 400 pupils, including an independent study program.

06:31:44.112 --> 06:31:53.638
The New West Charter mission is to provide an academically rigorous, highly individualized education for 21st century pupils in grade 6 through grade 12.

06:31:56.266 --> 06:32:08.634
Again, the first thing that we looked at was the academic achievement of the school as that's required for a renewal, and whether there were increases in that academic achievement.

06:32:08.714 --> 06:32:21.903
So we looked at both criteria, the standard criteria for renewal, and we found that the newest charter has met three of those five criteria, and has thus demonstrated increases in people academic achievement.

06:32:23.023 --> 06:32:36.052
We also looked at what LAUSD reviewed and that was the alternative measures that New West Charter proposed in its renewal petition based on the Smarter Balanced assessments data.

06:32:36.873 --> 06:32:52.003
New West Charter met or exceeded the performance standard for both English language arts literacy and mathematics for resident schools and New West Charter pupil subgroups maintained or achieved positive growth in academic performance.

06:32:53.164 --> 06:33:02.391
Therefore we find that the charter school met standard criteria for renewal and also even though it was a necessary the alternative measures as well.

06:33:05.013 --> 06:33:08.716
So in our review of the renewal petition and all the documents submitted

06:33:10.669 --> 06:33:15.692
We have found that the newest charter petition is consistent with sound educational practice.

06:33:16.312 --> 06:33:24.157
The petitioner has the capacity to implement the program, which includes a review of the financial statements and their operational plan.

06:33:25.138 --> 06:33:31.701
The multi-year financial plan is sustainable and provides for projected operating surpluses and adequate reserves.

06:33:32.882 --> 06:33:41.530
The petition also provides a reasonably comprehensive description of the multiple required elements, noting that there are some that require a technical amendment.

06:33:42.631 --> 06:33:47.736
Then I'll talk a little bit about admissions and that is the basis for our condition.

06:33:49.578 --> 06:33:57.005
The newest charter petition includes an element for governance, a section that describes the newest charter homeschool agreement.

06:33:58.419 --> 06:34:11.546
The CDE has serious concerns with the language in this section and specifically this agreement which include that it must be signed as a condition of enrollment before the beginning of each year or whenever a new student is enrolled.

06:34:12.507 --> 06:34:22.012
It includes a number of parent requirements such as parent volunteer hours, mandatory participation in the transportation mitigation monitoring program.

06:34:22.652 --> 06:34:32.799
that includes options, one that may result in a cost to the pupil, such as the pupil having to take the Metro line, bus or rail.

06:34:34.701 --> 06:34:43.107
Parent requirements also include attending an annual orientation meeting, participating in the election of parent representatives to the Board of Directors,

06:34:44.287 --> 06:34:47.629
Attend all scheduled parent teacher conferences annually.

06:34:48.329 --> 06:34:52.651
Attend back to school night, open houses and other school-wide events.

06:34:53.492 --> 06:35:02.056
Participate as a family in extracurricular school events such as book fairs, plays, talent shows, festivals and fundraising activities.

06:35:03.116 --> 06:35:06.197
And self-report compliance with the homeschool contract.

06:35:07.438 --> 06:35:17.322
In a review of the homeschool contract and enrollment agreement, there are additional requirements and conditions of enrollment that the parent and people must agree to by signing the required contracts.

06:35:17.903 --> 06:35:28.067
For example, they're required to purchase school supplies, pay for activity fees, such as after school athletics, field trips, and rental of musical instruments.

06:35:29.028 --> 06:35:35.393
Reimbursed the charter school for food when the child does not have a lunch and one is provided for by the charter school.

06:35:36.374 --> 06:35:41.438
And a mandatory uniform policy that requires the purchase of newest charter logo apparel.

06:35:43.360 --> 06:35:46.882
We find that the homeschool agreement does not belong in the governance section.

06:35:47.783 --> 06:36:02.390
of the petition, and more importantly, includes requirements as a condition of enrollment that are in conflict with legal requirements, including the California Constitution that promulgates a free public education system.

06:36:03.611 --> 06:36:14.036
Pupil fees requirements of people enrolled in a public school shall not be required to pay a pupil fee for participation in an educational activity pursuant to Education Code Section 9011.

06:36:16.637 --> 06:36:17.797
and charter school admissions.

06:36:17.897 --> 06:36:22.039
A charter school shall admit all pupils who wish to attend the school.

06:36:24.319 --> 06:36:42.965
There was a little discussion about this at the ACCS meeting and I believe that the petitioner had said that they had confirmed that they had not denied enrollment for any pupil because of this, but I think the commissioners had commented they were more concerned about those parents that were

06:36:43.585 --> 06:36:52.391
that turned away on their own because of the information that was in there that maybe they hadn't enrolled and that was a little more of a concern.

06:36:53.572 --> 06:37:03.659
So accordingly, the department is proposing a condition that New West Charter revise the homeschool agreement and enrollment agreement to remove all language that conflicts with statute.

06:37:04.220 --> 06:37:09.443
The specific recommendation is included in our recommendation on pages one and two of the item.

06:37:10.464 --> 06:37:21.587
So to summarize, we recommend that the State Board hold a public hearing and approve the renewal petition for newest charter with our proposed condition and technical amendments.

06:37:22.307 --> 06:37:28.028
Representatives from the Charter School and I believe LAUSD may still be here to comment.

06:37:30.049 --> 06:37:30.449
Okay.

06:37:31.089 --> 06:37:31.429
Thank you.

06:37:31.469 --> 06:37:36.270
We'll have technical questions first of Cindy, Board Member Williams.

06:37:38.895 --> 06:37:43.679
Could you just repeat what the enrollment preference situation is?

06:37:43.759 --> 06:37:50.184
Was this, remind me, is this the charter that had elementary school nearby that they were?

06:37:50.965 --> 06:37:51.245
Yes.

06:37:51.805 --> 06:37:58.591
And also that they could keep the enrollment preferences that we've approved before or was that a different charter?

06:37:59.771 --> 06:38:02.713
I'm not sure what was, we'd have to go back and look what was approved before.

06:38:03.313 --> 06:38:11.598
And even if it was, I think in the last few years we've been very consistent with the kids of the charter, kids of the district.

06:38:11.758 --> 06:38:19.662
We are allowing this one because it is in statute to allow them to give a preference for the Brockton Elementary because

06:38:20.722 --> 06:38:32.292
because it's legally allowed, but also because they are actively involved in the Charter School Facility Grant Program and they would not be eligible because they cannot serve the free and reduced price on their own.

06:38:32.532 --> 06:38:39.138
So they need that preference to maintain their funding in that program or eligibility in that program.

06:38:41.121 --> 06:38:41.802
Board Member Holliday.

06:38:41.982 --> 06:38:48.167
I'm sure you will in the hearing hear from the petitioners to explain this.

06:38:48.627 --> 06:38:52.951
But in the ACCS meeting it was made very clear that this is not just about money.

06:38:53.031 --> 06:38:56.794
This is not just about the grant money.

06:38:57.074 --> 06:39:06.542
This is about a really successful viable way of creating diversity in the school and serving the most needy students in that community.

06:39:06.942 --> 06:39:07.722
And it's working.

06:39:08.323 --> 06:39:10.545
And I highly thank

06:39:11.606 --> 06:39:19.232
the CDE for investigating this, making sure that it's all legal, but at the same time it's working for the right reasons.

06:39:19.532 --> 06:39:19.792
Anyway.

06:39:22.675 --> 06:39:26.458
Okay, if there's no more technical discussion, then I'll open the public hearing.

06:39:27.599 --> 06:39:32.883
Each side has 10 minutes and so we'll first take 10 minutes for the petitioners for the charter.

06:39:39.226 --> 06:39:46.870
Thank you to the California State Board of Education members for allowing New West Charter the opportunity to give a brief presentation today.

06:39:47.411 --> 06:39:54.074
My name is Sharon Weir and I'm very proud to be the Principal and Executive Director at New West Charter since 2005.

06:39:54.815 --> 06:40:05.181
I appreciate the members of the State Board have numerous informational documents related to New West and in respect of your time we will only highlight the most critical points of our renewal request.

06:40:06.141 --> 06:40:12.627
New West is fortunate to be an established state approved charter school in our 14th year of operation.

06:40:13.308 --> 06:40:19.253
As an SBE authorized charter school, we take both our role and responsibilities very seriously.

06:40:20.074 --> 06:40:28.622
We work diligently and in harmony with both our authorizer and oversight agent, the California Department of Education, to ensure we not only comply

06:40:29.362 --> 06:40:37.924
with all charter school operational and fiscal requirements, but we set very high standards in our academic expectations for all of our students.

06:40:38.584 --> 06:40:48.667
In addition, as a public school, we proactively seek the opportunities to be leaders in the charter school environment and the local and wider non-charter community.

06:40:49.547 --> 06:41:02.441
Over time we have grown and developed our programme from a 230 student middle school serving 6th through 8th grade to become a thriving middle and high school programme serving 825 students.

06:41:03.162 --> 06:41:08.548
We focus on career, college and the lifelong opportunities for the young people in our school.

06:41:09.108 --> 06:41:14.097
to ensure every student has a secure and optimistic plan for future success.

06:41:14.618 --> 06:41:20.608
Here to highlight some of the critical markers of our success is Dr. Tanisha Barnett, Assistant Director of Middle School.

06:41:23.743 --> 06:41:25.924
New West is known for its academic rigor.

06:41:26.445 --> 06:41:33.508
Our challenging curriculum that emphasizes teaching to students rather than the test has helped our students achieve tremendous results.

06:41:34.229 --> 06:41:48.897
By every measure, whether API, AYP, KC, CST of the past, SBAC, PSAT, SAT, ACT, and dashboard of the present, New West students consistently achieve above the local, state, and national averages.

06:41:49.637 --> 06:41:50.558
and it's getting noticed.

06:41:51.138 --> 06:41:58.161
On May 3rd, we were notified that we received a full six year accreditation from WASC.

06:41:59.002 --> 06:42:09.527
In the last month, newest students have admitted to every campus of the University of California and every campus of the California State University system they apply to.

06:42:10.526 --> 06:42:26.064
Along with big names like Stanford, Harvard, Princeton, Columbia, Cornell, Northwestern, Pomona, Yale, Harvard Mudd, Johns Hopkins, Brown, Berkeley, UCLA, USC, Dartmouth, Tums, and the University of Pennsylvania.

06:42:26.504 --> 06:42:27.445
And we're still rolling in.

06:42:28.246 --> 06:42:33.209
We're proud of our students' academic accomplishments, but we know they're not the greater goal.

06:42:34.010 --> 06:42:41.134
NUBAS doesn't just measure its success by the percentage of students it graduates, number of college admission earned, or amount of scholarships won.

06:42:41.855 --> 06:42:47.358
We measure success by how well we prepare our alumni to thrive in their university's career and personal lives.

06:42:48.439 --> 06:42:54.623
Long after they cross our commencement stage, as a result, our students themselves are the hallmarks of our success.

06:42:56.772 --> 06:43:08.602
Since our last renewal in 2012, the SBE provided us the opportunity to expand our program from a highly successful middle school by supporting the vision of New West to open a new public charter high school.

06:43:09.222 --> 06:43:16.308
It's noteworthy to mention that New West opened the first new public high school in West Los Angeles in almost 50 years.

06:43:18.530 --> 06:43:27.972
But what is even more interesting is that the opportunity of a new academically rigorous high school program is not restricted to any physical attendance boundary in LA.

06:43:28.552 --> 06:43:43.296
Given our doors are open to everyone, our population is both economically, racially, and geographically diverse, and the New West community welcomes families from over 73 zip codes over a sprawling urban landscape.

06:43:44.056 --> 06:43:55.085
Word about the expansion of New West quickly spread throughout LA and since our last renewal has resulted in almost 10,000 people attending our open houses, all desperately seeking admissions to our school.

06:43:55.926 --> 06:44:02.911
As a result of our reputation as a high quality public institution, New West is the longest wait list of any public school in LA County.

06:44:03.732 --> 06:44:17.058
Although New West is proud of the reputation it has gained as a successful public charter school, our success is a direct result of the endless hard work of our team and the tireless analysis of what makes and sustains quality in public education.

06:44:17.758 --> 06:44:27.423
We are delighted that the CDE staff are recommending renewal of our long-standing charter and appreciate their thoughtful and encouraging suggestions in our plans for further expansion.

06:44:28.243 --> 06:44:40.485
In addition, following the recent ACCS meeting held on April 5th, we were very appreciative of a 6-1 majority recommendation by the commissioners to also renew the New West petition.

06:44:41.045 --> 06:44:55.688
Furthermore, following the ACCS meeting, we were granted permission to meet with Ms Chan and the staff of the CDE and come to a greater understanding and agreement on the proposed technical amendments recommended for changes to the New West Home School Agreement.

06:44:56.508 --> 06:45:10.727
Overall a central tenet of our success is the new West Home School Agreement which is a direct link between home and school and has proven to be enormously successful in keeping alive the connection between parents, school and students.

06:45:11.508 --> 06:45:23.195
We have tried and tested data that proves that New West families proactively participate in the homeschool agreement and this successful practice has only generated closer relationships between home and school.

06:45:24.055 --> 06:45:33.741
As a school we must proceed with caution with requested changes to alter the homeschool agreement as there are significant economic impacts related to this provision in our charter.

06:45:34.361 --> 06:45:38.324
New West is situated in a facility with a rare 30-year lease.

06:45:38.865 --> 06:45:49.754
We have occupied the 1905 Armacost site since 2012 and have invested over $4 million in creating an amazing school for both our middle and high school students.

06:45:50.134 --> 06:45:54.498
However, the building is located in an industrial zone that requires a variance

06:45:55.018 --> 06:46:00.182
with a very specific conditional use permit issued by the LA Department of Building and Planning.

06:46:00.682 --> 06:46:08.068
We can only occupy the Armacost site if we agree to comply with traffic mitigation measures that are part of our homeschool agreement.

06:46:08.728 --> 06:46:18.895
Fortunately we have an excellent relationship with the LA Department of Building and Planning who gave New West the opportunity to design a creative traffic mitigation program called the TMMP.

06:46:19.936 --> 06:46:27.206
which works for every family at our school and does not impose unworkable traffic mitigation measures upon anyone.

06:46:27.992 --> 06:46:36.100
Not only does our current TMMP alleviate local congestion, but it contributes to the overall LA City plan for traffic reduction.

06:46:36.481 --> 06:46:38.323
In essence, it's a win-win for everyone.

06:46:38.943 --> 06:46:51.116
Simply put, the new West Homeschool Agreement is vital if we are to be permitted to continue to occupy our school building as a condition of meeting the specific requirements of the covenant agreed upon in the CUP.

06:46:51.956 --> 06:46:58.081
We look forward to continuing to implement the homeschool agreement in compliance with the conditions we have negotiated with the CDE.

06:46:59.545 --> 06:47:05.267
Finally, we would like to highlight our remaining concern with the technical amendments suggested by the CDE as it relates to admissions.

06:47:05.808 --> 06:47:12.570
In 2011, the SBE approved a short list of purposeful admissions preferences for New West.

06:47:13.191 --> 06:47:20.133
Most critically, the admissions preferences previously approved by the SBE enabled us to achieve two important goals.

06:47:20.614 --> 06:47:28.577
The first admissions preference, after continuing students, offered students who are most economically disadvantaged a first preference in our lottery.

06:47:29.197 --> 06:47:41.008
Since our last renewal, New West was able to establish an incredibly successful admissions preference with a local elementary non-charter local school district called Brockton Avenue Elementary.

06:47:41.588 --> 06:47:49.675
The vast majority of students who come from Brockton Elementary to New West are socioeconomically disadvantaged and many will be the first to attend college.

06:47:50.456 --> 06:48:01.160
It's taken multiple years of careful and respectful outreach to get to the point where 100% of the students and their families from Brockton Elementary accept the admissions preference into New West.

06:48:01.620 --> 06:48:08.623
This is a life-changing opportunity to place disadvantaged students at the front of the admissions line and can

06:48:09.483 --> 06:48:15.165
that can be over a thousand students long and place them on a secure path to college and career success.

06:48:15.785 --> 06:48:20.626
The second admissions preference that's been previously permitted by the SBE relates to siblings.

06:48:21.346 --> 06:48:29.648
Almost 100% of the siblings who come to New West live in the local district but are given a preference that allows families to stay together.

06:48:30.269 --> 06:48:34.930
Siblings at New West make up for almost 35% of our incoming sixth grade class

06:48:35.530 --> 06:48:44.460
To deny local district students the opportunity to stay with their older brother or sister at New West is counterintuitive to supporting families and schools.

06:48:45.261 --> 06:48:53.590
These two specific admissions preferences that were previously approved by the SBE directly comply with both current law and relevant statute.

06:48:53.950 --> 06:48:55.992
Nothing has changed in the past five years.

06:48:56.773 --> 06:49:05.423
It's unquestionable that the current preferences as they appear in our previous and new charter petition support increasing diversity and keeping families together at New West.

06:49:05.943 --> 06:49:16.234
We respectfully request that the SBE allow New West to continue with their previously approved list of admissions preferences as described in the renewal petition presented today.

06:49:16.975 --> 06:49:26.818
Overall we truly hope the SBE will support our charter renewal and expansion and carefully consider the significant impact of so many technical amendments on a very well established school.

06:49:27.518 --> 06:49:39.401
In closing we would like to add that we are both very excited and genuinely looking forward to continuing on as a role model school and would take great pride in further approval if granted by the State Board of Education.

06:49:40.081 --> 06:49:42.042
Thank you sincerely to the State Board of Education

06:49:42.682 --> 06:49:46.323
of state board members for your time and listening to my Scottish accent.

06:49:46.463 --> 06:49:47.164
I appreciate that.

06:49:48.464 --> 06:49:48.664
Okay.

06:49:48.704 --> 06:49:49.084
Thank you.

06:49:49.344 --> 06:49:54.266
And now the 10 minutes is up and now the opponents have 10 minutes.

06:49:59.688 --> 06:50:00.328
No opponents.

06:50:00.568 --> 06:50:01.028
Okay.

06:50:02.349 --> 06:50:02.629
All right.

06:50:02.649 --> 06:50:04.349
I'm declaring public hearing closed.

06:50:05.950 --> 06:50:09.251
And now we're ready for public comment.

06:50:11.431 --> 06:50:15.346
We have three speakers, Angela DeRamos, Eric Premack, and Janelle Rooley.

06:50:15.486 --> 06:50:16.028
Please line up.

06:50:31.252 --> 06:50:32.414
Eric Premax, CSDC.

06:50:32.594 --> 06:50:44.595
We support the approval of the appeal with the elimination of the fee-related provisions of the parent agreement in support of their traffic plan.

06:50:44.715 --> 06:50:44.996
Thank you.

06:50:50.708 --> 06:50:55.913
Good afternoon again, Janelle Rooley with the Law Offices of Young, Many, and Core here in strong support of New West Charter.

06:50:56.493 --> 06:51:00.057
New West has been proud to be a state board authorized school since its inception.

06:51:00.477 --> 06:51:04.441
The charter school appreciates and values its positive relationship with CDE staff.

06:51:05.734 --> 06:51:10.877
As you're considering this renewal, we ask that you approve the admissions preferences in the proposed charter renewal petition.

06:51:11.537 --> 06:51:21.522
These include existing students who are exempt from the lottery, the SB 740 preference that we've spoken about, district siblings, in-district students, and children of employees.

06:51:22.283 --> 06:51:26.385
CDE staff have already changed their recommendation regarding the SB 740 students.

06:51:27.385 --> 06:51:28.025
I'm sorry, preference.

06:51:29.126 --> 06:51:34.249
The statute's clear that charter schools may give a preference for, I'm sorry, must give a preference for-

06:51:41.547 --> 06:51:44.374
Good afternoon, Michelle Lynch on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association.

06:51:44.435 --> 06:51:48.225
We too are in support of the renewal today with those preferences included.

06:51:48.425 --> 06:51:48.686
Thank you.

06:51:52.915 --> 06:51:56.617
Hi, Angela Duramos with California Teachers Association.

06:51:56.978 --> 06:52:06.884
The California Teachers Association is opposed to the state board overturning the decision of local control district of local control local school district in denying charter school petitions.

06:52:07.385 --> 06:52:12.228
The locally elected school board is directly accountable to the community and clearly operates with that in mind.

06:52:12.568 --> 06:52:18.332
The same cannot be said with stated authorized charters who are authorized by appointed members as opposed to elected ones.

06:52:18.812 --> 06:52:26.297
If we as a state believe in local control policies as evidenced by LCFF, then let's be consistent in our goal of being responsive to communities.

06:52:26.497 --> 06:52:26.797
Thank you.

06:52:26.817 --> 06:52:29.379
Okay.

06:52:29.499 --> 06:52:31.180
Is that the end of the public comment?

06:52:31.200 --> 06:52:33.361
Okay.

06:52:33.702 --> 06:52:34.382
That's closed.

06:52:34.402 --> 06:52:35.143
Board member.

06:52:35.163 --> 06:52:39.645
I'd like to ask the petitioners to come back up, please.

06:52:39.685 --> 06:52:40.486
I have a couple of questions.

06:52:48.254 --> 06:52:50.663
So it appears as though.

06:52:51.972 --> 06:52:58.975
Previous state boards and current CDE and ACTS are very supportive of your school and the work that you're doing.

06:52:58.995 --> 06:53:18.022
We want to be very careful about these conditions that the CDE is recommending and make sure that we're all in agreement about these and that each of these conditions is appropriate, you know, for the situation.

06:53:19.883 --> 06:53:31.567
So please articulate carefully which... Do you agree with the CDE recommendation for renewal with the technical amendments and conditions as written?

06:53:34.968 --> 06:53:35.268
Okay.

06:53:36.409 --> 06:53:36.949
I'm getting there.

06:53:37.549 --> 06:53:39.350
Let's start with the basic.

06:53:40.130 --> 06:53:41.010
So no, you do not.

06:53:41.170 --> 06:53:41.310
Okay.

06:53:41.770 --> 06:53:46.052
And so specifically, which ones do you disagree with?

06:53:47.025 --> 06:53:52.892
So I met with Cindy Chan a few weeks ago and we went through the admissions conditions.

06:53:53.613 --> 06:53:59.961
And my request was that the conditions as they were written in 2011 should be repeated now.

06:54:00.482 --> 06:54:04.427
And those conditions, as Miss Shirley had indicated, were continuing kids.

06:54:05.027 --> 06:54:12.191
There were SB 740 preference, then there was in-district siblings and then we had other preferences beyond that.

06:54:12.231 --> 06:54:15.433
So I'm asking for those preferences to remain.

06:54:15.773 --> 06:54:20.876
What was initially proposed by the CDE was simply returning students and then students of the district.

06:54:21.576 --> 06:54:27.623
They've also mentioned subsequently that we can keep the SB 740 preference, but we're also going to have two sites.

06:54:28.023 --> 06:54:32.869
So it's going to be Brockton Elementary and Richland Elementary because there's two school sites that apply to this.

06:54:33.550 --> 06:54:35.712
The other point that I want to mention is the TMMP.

06:54:37.153 --> 06:54:46.160
We have a signed covenant that CDE was involved in when we took on this new site, which requires us to have a TMMP programme.

06:54:46.560 --> 06:54:59.490
It does not cost a single penny for any kid to participate in that, but it's a requirement of occupation of this site, so we're asking for that TMMP and families to be asked to participate in it to remain.

06:54:59.830 --> 06:55:03.991
Let me ask you a specific question about, I understand the preferences now.

06:55:04.071 --> 06:55:08.772
Let me ask a very specific question about this TMPP or whatever.

06:55:10.873 --> 06:55:15.814
That is an agreement that the school has made with the city, correct?

06:55:16.994 --> 06:55:19.775
That is not an agreement that the parents have made with the city.

06:55:22.315 --> 06:55:23.556
There are lots of ways

06:55:25.407 --> 06:55:37.296
of helping parents understand the value of supporting the school in this agreement without having them enter into a signed agreement.

06:55:37.836 --> 06:55:38.297
Would you agree?

06:55:38.337 --> 06:55:38.397
Yes.

06:55:39.678 --> 06:55:40.038
Thank you.

06:55:44.301 --> 06:55:45.002
Board Member Rucker.

06:55:50.876 --> 06:56:04.476
Okay, so I just want to make sure I understand on the admissions requirements that there's a packet of information in your admissions packet that I want to make sure is going to be corrected.

06:56:07.142 --> 06:56:17.867
the admissions packet that you had requires some financial commitments from the parents as well as some volunteer hours.

06:56:18.307 --> 06:56:21.589
Are you disagreeing to take that out of your admissions packet?

06:56:22.089 --> 06:56:22.829
Absolutely not.

06:56:22.909 --> 06:56:24.730
In actual fact, that's already been changed.

06:56:24.870 --> 06:56:26.731
Okay, I just wanted to make sure I was clear on that.

06:56:27.312 --> 06:56:34.315
And then as it relates to the admissions preferences, can you explain to me why

06:56:34.835 --> 06:56:37.080
You need, you feel you need to hang on to that.

06:56:37.120 --> 06:56:41.510
How many families at your school are actually impacted by that right now?

06:56:41.789 --> 06:56:47.634
By the sibling preference, 35% of our incoming sixth grade students are siblings.

06:56:48.275 --> 06:56:52.298
Most of them are in the district, about 95% of them are already in the district.

06:56:52.739 --> 06:56:55.601
And can you tell me what the diversity is at your school right now?

06:56:56.502 --> 06:56:59.545
About 50% Caucasian students, 50% minority students.

06:56:59.725 --> 06:57:02.508
Okay, so when you say 50% minority, could you break that down?

06:57:02.748 --> 06:57:03.028
Sure.

06:57:03.669 --> 06:57:05.290
I'm answering every question.

06:57:05.550 --> 06:57:06.091
No, that's okay.

06:57:07.096 --> 06:57:09.018
Oh, I don't mind who answers.

06:57:09.558 --> 06:57:11.840
First of all, let me just say I'm from the South.

06:57:11.900 --> 06:57:16.645
And when you're from the South and you have a Southern accent, they lower your IQ 20 points and look at you sweetly.

06:57:17.005 --> 06:57:19.847
So I wish I had your Southern, your Scottish accent.

06:57:20.988 --> 06:57:22.390
So it doesn't matter who.

06:57:22.930 --> 06:57:24.792
So it doesn't matter who answers the question.

06:57:24.832 --> 06:57:25.572
That's just fine.

06:57:25.853 --> 06:57:29.216
But the question I asked was, could you break down the 50 percent minority?

06:57:29.776 --> 06:57:30.036
Sure.

06:57:30.076 --> 06:57:34.657
So, roughly speaking, we're looking at about 26 Latinos.

06:57:34.997 --> 06:57:35.437
26% Latino?

06:57:35.477 --> 06:57:35.697
Yes.

06:57:35.797 --> 06:57:35.898
Okay.

06:57:35.958 --> 06:57:36.158
Yes.

06:57:36.818 --> 06:57:38.738
Based on that preference of the SBC 740.

06:57:38.958 --> 06:57:41.399
It really helps us with our diversity breakdown.

06:57:42.319 --> 06:57:44.960
We have about 11% African-American.

06:57:45.200 --> 06:57:47.340
We have 6% Asian.

06:57:48.461 --> 06:57:50.681
And I'm not sure what the remaining percentage is.

06:57:50.841 --> 06:57:51.421
About 7%.

06:57:51.861 --> 06:57:53.202
Give or take mixed groups.

06:57:53.282 --> 06:57:56.482
And then within that, there's the client estate.

06:57:57.563 --> 06:57:57.683
Okay.

06:57:57.703 --> 06:57:58.303
All right.

06:57:58.343 --> 06:57:58.603
Thank you.

06:58:02.230 --> 06:58:03.991
Any other questions by board members?

06:58:06.212 --> 06:58:07.612
If not, are we ready for a motion?

06:58:08.813 --> 06:58:09.953
Board member Williams.

06:58:11.914 --> 06:58:21.518
I move that we approve this renewal and but to keep the enrollment preferences the same as were approved in 2011.

06:58:28.961 --> 06:58:30.162
Cindy's going to come up here and correct me.

06:58:31.434 --> 06:58:32.515
Yeah, you can sit down.

06:58:32.775 --> 06:58:33.616
Yes.

06:58:35.077 --> 06:58:37.519
Yeah, you may return to your seats.

06:58:38.039 --> 06:58:42.482
So, I mean, none of us were here in that year when it was approved.

06:58:42.502 --> 06:58:49.688
But when we go back and look at the item and the minutes for that renewal, it looks the same as what we're proposing.

06:58:49.728 --> 06:58:56.413
All it mentions is kids of the charter that are returning to the school, kids of the district and then the preference for the 740.

06:58:59.315 --> 06:59:02.937
Yeah, it's not in the item nor in the minutes.

06:59:03.097 --> 06:59:05.039
You're saying it's not in the item or minutes from 2011?

06:59:05.559 --> 06:59:06.179
Yeah.

06:59:06.379 --> 06:59:11.122
So we looked at it because we just weren't sure because none of us had been here during that other renewal.

06:59:11.943 --> 06:59:14.405
So that doesn't look like what was approved back in 2011.

06:59:14.465 --> 06:59:16.466
So I just want to clarify that.

06:59:17.106 --> 06:59:34.623
And then in terms of just to make it easier, when we look at the conditions as a whole, if they were to keep that homeschool agreement as is with all of those conditions of enrollment, mandatory thing, that's what makes that traffic policy a problem because it looks like they're required.

06:59:35.223 --> 06:59:41.684
if they remove and clean up the homeschool agreement, then that's more of a policy that's in there.

06:59:41.704 --> 06:59:46.845
It really should be separate, but we are worried that there might be some harm done to the facility.

06:59:46.925 --> 06:59:49.166
So they need to remove that language.

06:59:49.346 --> 06:59:53.907
I mean, we're more concerned with not allowing pupils to attend.

06:59:53.987 --> 06:59:55.287
That's part of charter law.

06:59:55.767 --> 06:59:57.248
So that's why we propose that.

06:59:57.348 --> 06:59:58.728
That is a legal requirement.

06:59:59.208 --> 07:00:10.074
So what, in essence, what this motion that was just made by Member Williams is identical to your recommendation, except for the sibling preference.

07:00:10.154 --> 07:00:10.854
Is that correct?

07:00:11.654 --> 07:00:19.698
What we, it looked like what we proposed and what was passed in the renewal is exactly what we're saying in this one, which is.

07:00:19.718 --> 07:00:21.339
No, I'm not talking about 2011.

07:00:21.819 --> 07:00:22.560
I'm talking about now.

07:00:23.900 --> 07:00:24.081
Right.

07:00:24.541 --> 07:00:26.782
So Member Williams, I believe,

07:00:28.223 --> 07:00:29.124
We don't have siblings.

07:00:29.264 --> 07:00:29.784
We haven't.

07:00:30.024 --> 07:00:30.425
I know that.

07:00:31.405 --> 07:00:39.632
But your recommendation for renewal, right, is identical to what Member Williams said, except for the sibling preference.

07:00:39.692 --> 07:00:40.312
Is that correct?

07:00:41.173 --> 07:00:46.357
In other words, I was approving everything that you that you have in there except for the adding the sibling preference.

07:00:46.637 --> 07:00:46.717
Yes.

07:00:46.737 --> 07:00:46.917
Okay.

07:00:47.137 --> 07:00:47.838
Yeah.

07:00:47.998 --> 07:00:48.198
Okay.

07:00:48.238 --> 07:00:48.538
Okay.

07:00:48.558 --> 07:00:50.239
So I just want to make sure I'm clear.

07:00:50.260 --> 07:00:52.041
I just want to make sure I'm clear on your motion.

07:00:54.707 --> 07:00:56.748
Yeah, I just want to make it on this point.

07:00:57.328 --> 07:01:03.030
All of the other conditions proposed by the staff you're saying need to be part of the renewal.

07:01:03.550 --> 07:01:14.794
The only thing that you are adding is based on the request and the explanation from the charter that they be allowed to continue the enrollment preference to include the siblings.

07:01:15.474 --> 07:01:15.814
Okay.

07:01:17.455 --> 07:01:18.375
And that I will second.

07:01:18.936 --> 07:01:19.356
Okay.

07:01:19.376 --> 07:01:20.856
So we have a motion and a second.

07:01:21.636 --> 07:01:22.737
Further board discussion?

07:01:24.013 --> 07:01:25.394
All those in favor, raise your hands.

07:01:26.555 --> 07:01:26.955
Okay.

07:01:27.416 --> 07:01:28.877
That one carries.

07:01:28.897 --> 07:01:34.682
So we're getting the final item, which is the Paramount Collegiate Academy.

07:01:34.702 --> 07:01:37.684
One more.

07:01:53.607 --> 07:01:55.068
Okay, six of six.

07:01:56.570 --> 07:01:58.451
Okay, last item of the day.

07:01:58.611 --> 07:02:02.694
So again, Cindy Chan, Charter Schools Division at the California Department of Education.

07:02:02.735 --> 07:02:09.000
So this is the only material revision that we're actually bringing to you today.

07:02:09.020 --> 07:02:15.225
Item 21 is a request for a material revision from a current State Board of Education authorized charter school.

07:02:16.045 --> 07:02:23.589
Paramount Collegiate Academy was originally denied by the San Juan Unified School District and the Sacramento County Board of Education.

07:02:24.410 --> 07:02:41.399
Paramount appealed to the state and was approved by the state board in May 2015 for a five-year term to serve up to 200 pupils in grade six through grade nine, adding an additional grade level each year, expanding to 800 pupils in grade six through grade 12 by 2019-20.

07:02:44.421 --> 07:02:47.062
Paramount is currently in its second year of operation.

07:02:48.722 --> 07:02:53.663
Paramount's original petition was budgeted to begin its first year of operation, 2015-16, with 200 pupils.

07:02:53.703 --> 07:02:57.563
However, Paramount began instruction with a total enrollment of 56 pupils, a decline of 72%.

07:02:57.603 --> 07:03:00.924
By March 15, 2016, Paramount's second interim report reported current enrollment at 61 pupils,

07:03:13.546 --> 07:03:21.708
and projected an ending fund balance of $9,600 with a 0.84% reserve.

07:03:22.808 --> 07:03:36.032
As a result of the significant decline or actually not able to make that enrollment target in Paramount's then current enrollment and projected enrollment for the subsequent school years,

07:03:36.832 --> 07:03:52.740
The CD issued a letter of fiscal concern requiring Paramount to submit a material revision to the PCA petition, revising its multi-year budget and cash flow statements to align with the lower, more realistic pupil enrollment.

07:03:53.600 --> 07:04:04.965
In addition, the CD requested that the material revision also address the proposed actions that the PCA board will take to ensure pupil enrollment growth.

07:04:06.005 --> 07:04:11.628
On November 1st, the CD received PCA's request for a material revision to its charter.

07:04:12.588 --> 07:04:24.655
to reduce projected enrollment from its original enrollment plan of 800 pupils by year 5 to 140 pupils in grade 6 through grade 12 by 2019-20.

07:04:25.575 --> 07:04:34.900
Based on a review of the petition documents, and again we do a full petition review, the CD recommends that the State Board hold a public hearing and therefore

07:04:36.281 --> 07:04:42.486
thereafter approve with technical amendments the request for a material revision of the Paramount Charter.

07:04:43.306 --> 07:04:59.818
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools considered the Paramount material revision at its April 5th meeting and unanimously voted to approve CDE's recommendation that the State Board approve the Paramount material revision with the technical amendments proposed by the CDE.

07:05:01.259 --> 07:05:04.481
So we reviewed the entire PCA material revision petition.

07:05:05.041 --> 07:05:14.586
We find that it meets the standards and criteria requirements and provides a reasonably comprehensive description of the multiple required elements with our few technical amendments.

07:05:15.847 --> 07:05:26.133
For your consideration, the two primary components of the material revision are the recruitment and outreach plan and the budget, which I will summarize as follows.

07:05:26.974 --> 07:05:32.760
As part of the material revision, Paramount has made pupil enrollment and recruitment its number one priority.

07:05:33.721 --> 07:05:43.332
Paramount is now partnering with the California Charter Schools Association to address enrollment growth through its multifaceted recruitment and outreach plan.

07:05:44.373 --> 07:05:50.840
The Paramount founder is here today and can more fully present to you with details on what those efforts are.

07:05:53.203 --> 07:06:02.794
We performed a thorough review of Paramount's revised budget and multi-year fiscal plan as the material revision proposes to significantly reduce the original enrollment.

07:06:04.035 --> 07:06:12.729
We note that Paramount ended fiscal year 2015-16, so its first year, with a negative ending fund balance of $131,000 that was carried forward to the current year.

07:06:17.813 --> 07:06:23.597
Paramount has revised its current expenditures in response to the decline in revenues due to the lower enrollment.

07:06:24.398 --> 07:06:29.021
This includes adjustments to salaries, benefits, and professional consulting services.

07:06:30.021 --> 07:06:34.765
To cover monthly negative cash flow, Paramount received a low-interest five-year loan.

07:06:35.665 --> 07:06:40.829
Both the loan proceeds and annual repayments have been included in Paramount's revised financial plan.

07:06:42.330 --> 07:06:49.616
The multi-year budget submitted by Paramount with the mature revision includes reduced revenues and expenditures across all years.

07:06:51.097 --> 07:07:04.128
Paramount is projecting a modest growth in enrollment of 20 pupils each year through fiscal year 2019-20, which will increase local control funding formula revenues accordingly.

07:07:05.009 --> 07:07:13.668
Paramount is also projecting expenditure reductions to salaries and benefits, book supplies, services, and other operating expenses.

07:07:15.856 --> 07:07:25.381
We find that the paramount adjusted multi-year financial plan to be reasonably sufficient as the charter school begins to rebuild its reserves beginning next year.

07:07:25.401 --> 07:07:29.603
So I want to, it sounds good, it all sounds good.

07:07:31.184 --> 07:07:35.306
But the current year budget, I'm going to be really straightforward, it's not robust by any means.

07:07:35.326 --> 07:07:37.927
It is not where we would like to see one of our schools.

07:07:39.148 --> 07:07:43.431
They have had negative monthly cash flow for the first six months of the year.

07:07:44.512 --> 07:07:50.517
But it's looking like they're projecting to end the year with positive cash flow each month.

07:07:50.597 --> 07:07:54.100
So they did have a cash balance, which is what they're kind of operating off of.

07:07:54.820 --> 07:08:11.876
They're dependent on that cash until they can get that enrollment up and they're monitoring it closely and regularly and with the expenditure cuts which we did question because we want to make sure the cuts don't hurt the program because they had to make such significant cuts.

07:08:13.337 --> 07:08:19.061
The recruitment efforts it has and will continue to implement are, I mean, that's the whole thing for them.

07:08:19.121 --> 07:08:21.282
It's so important that they get their enrollment up.

07:08:21.763 --> 07:08:24.845
They're dependent absolutely on the enrollment growth.

07:08:26.326 --> 07:08:35.952
In our opinion, they cannot afford to make any additional budget reductions without impacting, we believe, their educational program and their operations.

07:08:37.409 --> 07:08:47.434
So in summary, we recommend that the state board hold the public hearing, thereafter approve the request for a material revision of the charter with our recommended technical amendments.

07:08:47.454 --> 07:08:52.197
So I know the school's here, they have their students and they're gonna present to you.

07:08:56.899 --> 07:08:58.560
Any clarifying questions for Ms.

07:08:58.640 --> 07:08:59.561
Chan before we start?

07:09:01.178 --> 07:09:04.100
Okay, so I declare the public hearing open.

07:09:04.120 --> 07:09:07.843
So all those, will the petitioners come forward, Paramount?

07:09:15.508 --> 07:09:16.249
You have 10 minutes.

07:09:18.070 --> 07:09:20.252
Good afternoon, State Board.

07:09:23.243 --> 07:09:30.585
As you heard in the presentation, PCA was approved by the State Board in May of 2015.

07:09:31.105 --> 07:09:47.168
And in the reports that we've provided to the CDE, we explained that in our opening year, we started off with a late start, which carried into this second year.

07:09:48.884 --> 07:09:54.686
And it critically affected our enrollment in year one.

07:09:55.726 --> 07:10:09.490
The other obstacles that we had to overcome in year one was that when we acquired a facility that had been abandoned and we made major renovations to that building.

07:10:10.170 --> 07:10:12.731
The building was not ready until September.

07:10:13.331 --> 07:10:16.612
So in year one, we started the school year late

07:10:18.366 --> 07:10:22.248
And we put a lot of money into the renovations of the facility.

07:10:24.249 --> 07:10:31.872
Going into this year, in working with the CDE, we did make extensive cuts in our budget.

07:10:31.892 --> 07:10:36.594
We made over $125,000 cuts in salary and benefits.

07:10:41.457 --> 07:10:48.435
And we made nearly $40,000 cut in our lease, which was renegotiated.

07:10:49.858 --> 07:11:14.462
So where we've focused on this year after we balanced our budget, and actually as of our last budget report, we're currently close to $50,000 in reserve above the 3% reserve that's required, which is about $110,000 in the positive.

07:11:14.482 --> 07:11:15.222
And that's as of March.

07:11:20.503 --> 07:11:25.245
So we've recouped about $250,000 in this school year.

07:11:25.365 --> 07:11:26.565
We've turned things around.

07:11:27.706 --> 07:11:30.567
And we focused on enrollment growth.

07:11:31.187 --> 07:11:41.591
We've spent a lot of time this year just all of the things that are listed in the report here that we provided to CDE.

07:11:43.151 --> 07:11:48.313
We've done all of those things and we continue to work on enrollment.

07:11:49.113 --> 07:11:58.081
We've already met our target for the next school year and we intend to exceed that target to continue enrolling students.

07:11:58.681 --> 07:12:03.646
We have not capped out any of our enrollment at any of our school grades.

07:12:04.286 --> 07:12:14.235
We're already opening up a second class of seventh and a second class of eighth grade students and we're going to continue to enroll through the summer.

07:12:17.137 --> 07:12:21.740
Kind of just going through all of the different enrollment campaigns and things.

07:12:21.820 --> 07:12:27.884
We've held extensive social media campaigns that we continue.

07:12:28.484 --> 07:12:37.850
And we're working on right now getting ready to reissue out an extensive Facebook, Google, AdWord, and website campaign.

07:12:38.751 --> 07:12:41.573
We're continuing to hold parent meetings and tours

07:12:46.053 --> 07:12:49.854
that continuing this time of the school year and into the summer.

07:12:50.795 --> 07:13:02.699
We also are participating in recruitment activities at local festivals, at the upcoming county fair, and summer festivals that are located in the Arden Arcade area.

07:13:04.059 --> 07:13:15.942
And we are preparing online summer resources for students and incoming students that are requesting additional resources for mathematics.

07:13:17.122 --> 07:13:30.165
We're responding to a lot of parent requests and we've partnered now with two other K-8 charter schools in the Sacramento region that we're articulating with and we're getting a lot of enrollment

07:13:31.125 --> 07:13:36.887
from one of those charters in particular as we just continue to grow.

07:13:36.967 --> 07:13:41.929
And like I said, we're just continuing to just really have a keen focus on enrollment.

07:13:49.832 --> 07:13:50.252
Okay.

07:13:51.933 --> 07:13:52.493
You're welcome.

07:13:52.533 --> 07:13:52.973
Thank you.

07:13:52.993 --> 07:13:53.854
All right.

07:13:54.854 --> 07:13:59.416
So, the opponents are... Is there any opposition to this item?

07:14:01.178 --> 07:14:02.139
for ten minutes.

07:14:04.080 --> 07:14:04.520
If not.

07:14:04.620 --> 07:14:05.380
Not that I'm aware of.

07:14:05.400 --> 07:14:05.480
Okay.

07:14:06.021 --> 07:14:10.343
If not, I declare the public hearing closed and we're ready for public comment.

07:14:11.183 --> 07:14:14.605
We have Jesse Aguilar and Andra Donovan signed up.

07:14:21.309 --> 07:14:22.029
And Michelle Lowe.

07:14:25.391 --> 07:14:25.631
Lynch.

07:14:27.964 --> 07:14:29.965
Sorry, I forgot to grab the sheet before they took it away.

07:14:30.246 --> 07:14:32.687
Michelle Lynch on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association.

07:14:32.707 --> 07:14:35.329
I just wanted to say we are working closely with the school.

07:14:35.389 --> 07:14:45.256
We have a parent team that goes out to help schools get more parents in and basically just, you know, expand on the efforts that they're already doing.

07:14:45.316 --> 07:14:49.119
So we are very hopeful that we'll be getting some more enrollment with the school and we'll be working closely with them.

07:14:49.139 --> 07:14:51.621
And right now we do ask that you support this mature revision today.

07:14:51.821 --> 07:14:52.101
Thank you.

07:14:58.305 --> 07:14:58.705
Good afternoon.

07:14:58.765 --> 07:15:00.826
It's Jesse Eagle with the California Teachers Association.

07:15:01.226 --> 07:15:09.290
CTA is deeply concerned that the request for a material revision from 800 pupils to 140 pupils signals deeper ongoing problems.

07:15:09.731 --> 07:15:16.354
We believe that the educational program has been significantly affected and we urge the board to deny.

07:15:16.534 --> 07:15:19.555
Thank you.

07:15:19.675 --> 07:15:20.696
Public comment closed.

07:15:20.876 --> 07:15:23.957
I believe we may have one or two students planning on making a public comment.

07:15:23.977 --> 07:15:27.099
If you have not been called and you wish to speak, please come forward.

07:15:48.208 --> 07:15:49.469
Hi I'm Tatiana.

07:15:49.729 --> 07:15:56.032
I started middle school at PCA last year and didn't like the idea of leaving all of my friends and teachers.

07:15:56.592 --> 07:16:02.636
The first day at PCA I was nervous but immediately changed my mind when I met my amazing teachers and friends.

07:16:03.116 --> 07:16:06.638
Some of my favorite classes are Spanish, student government and math.

07:16:07.558 --> 07:16:09.979
What I like about student government is how involved it is.

07:16:10.219 --> 07:16:15.242
We do campus beautification and lots of fun activities like our school dances and walk-ins.

07:16:15.902 --> 07:16:20.045
My mom offered to move me to a different school, but I declined because I didn't want to leave.

07:16:20.065 --> 07:16:24.007
I enjoy attending PCA and feel other students should experience the school.

07:16:24.187 --> 07:16:24.487
Thank you.

07:16:34.793 --> 07:16:36.154
Hi, my name is Jadida.

07:16:36.355 --> 07:16:38.297
I started going to PCA in middle school.

07:16:38.837 --> 07:16:40.679
I started the same day as Tatiana.

07:16:40.819 --> 07:16:45.144
I love the way that there were people welcoming me to be their friend.

07:16:46.423 --> 07:16:54.468
Something that is amazing about PCA is the way that teachers help you individually to raise your grade or with your homework.

07:16:55.428 --> 07:17:02.132
I also love the way that there is a lot of technology and that we get our own tablets to help us out.

07:17:02.952 --> 07:17:08.575
Last of all is the way there is classes like coding, student government, Spanish and more.

07:17:09.056 --> 07:17:09.376
Thank you.

07:17:17.392 --> 07:17:18.693
Hi, my name is Alyssa.

07:17:19.093 --> 07:17:23.917
I was one of the first kids at PCA and I immediately liked it.

07:17:24.237 --> 07:17:28.640
PCA has amazing classes like math, science, Spanish, and student government.

07:17:28.840 --> 07:17:31.061
Coding is one of the classes and my favorite.

07:17:32.362 --> 07:17:33.203
I really love it.

07:17:33.283 --> 07:17:35.665
The teachers push us to excel in all of our classes.

07:17:36.065 --> 07:17:37.146
They want us to succeed.

07:17:37.326 --> 07:17:40.808
My school has homework, help for kids who need it.

07:17:41.048 --> 07:17:42.970
We do many fun activities like dance,

07:17:43.700 --> 07:17:45.063
dances, games, and walk-ins.

07:17:45.184 --> 07:17:48.712
PCA is an amazing school and I want other kids to experience it.

07:17:48.913 --> 07:17:49.274
Thank you.

07:17:55.814 --> 07:17:56.614
Hi, I'm Vlad.

07:17:56.814 --> 07:18:00.676
And personally, I like PCA because we get to learn a lot of cool things.

07:18:01.056 --> 07:18:03.457
For example, we'll learn how to code on computers.

07:18:03.897 --> 07:18:05.498
We do awesome science experiments.

07:18:05.918 --> 07:18:07.039
We also have building block.

07:18:07.579 --> 07:18:09.500
And in building block, we have different clubs.

07:18:09.940 --> 07:18:16.843
Some clubs, for example, sports club, scratch coding, music club, and the best of all, homework help.

07:18:18.632 --> 07:18:22.375
A lot of our teachers take out their time to stay in school and help us with our homework.

07:18:22.996 --> 07:18:26.159
Most of our homework is done on computer, which makes things much easier.

07:18:27.980 --> 07:18:30.102
Overall, I think PCA is a great school.

07:18:30.783 --> 07:18:31.083
Thank you.

07:18:36.104 --> 07:18:37.424
Hi, my name is Rebecca.

07:18:37.965 --> 07:18:39.665
I am on PCA's robotics team.

07:18:40.065 --> 07:18:42.646
Last summer, I found out about PCA.

07:18:42.946 --> 07:18:44.186
My mom told me all about it.

07:18:44.526 --> 07:18:51.288
And the second I heard about it, I couldn't wait to go, especially when I heard about the robotics and the engineering and the coding.

07:18:52.088 --> 07:18:54.909
Since then, I got really good at coding and 3D modeling.

07:18:55.649 --> 07:18:59.130
What makes this school special is that they have engineering for sixth grade and up.

07:18:59.550 --> 07:19:04.712
They have students compete in regional competitions, like when we went to the competition at NASA this year.

07:19:05.712 --> 07:19:10.896
Also, we have homework help and small classes so everyone can get help and has the ability to pass.

07:19:11.416 --> 07:19:12.657
This is why I love PCA.

07:19:12.938 --> 07:19:13.278
Thank you.

07:19:17.105 --> 07:19:18.966
Okay, that closes the public comment.

07:19:19.786 --> 07:19:22.268
Now we're ready for board public discussion.

07:19:23.488 --> 07:19:24.909
Board member Holliday.

07:19:25.749 --> 07:19:33.473
So I think we heard about the couple issues they had when they first started up that affected their enrollment.

07:19:33.813 --> 07:19:38.116
The building not ready, having to start after the regular schools started.

07:19:38.176 --> 07:19:38.796
That can be a

07:19:39.432 --> 07:19:42.014
disastrous thing for startup charter school, of course.

07:19:42.934 --> 07:19:49.059
And it sounds as though they have their enrollment at the projected figure for this coming year.

07:19:49.439 --> 07:19:55.283
I certainly hope that there's no further cuts because it will impact the program that there are further cuts.

07:19:55.663 --> 07:20:04.469
But it sounds as though working with CCSA and with all of their outreach efforts that they're on track to be fiscally solid.

07:20:04.629 --> 07:20:09.292
I think we should give them a second chance and I would move the staff recommendation.

07:20:11.553 --> 07:20:12.193
Board Member Williams.

07:20:13.353 --> 07:20:26.857
I would second that recommendation and I would encourage the school to use, I really liked hearing all of the students and especially the females be interested in coding and computer science.

07:20:27.717 --> 07:20:36.120
And I would, I think it could be a real recruitment tool for you to make sure that students that you're recruiting know that that's available.

07:20:38.846 --> 07:20:40.167
Any further board discussion?

07:20:41.368 --> 07:20:41.589
Not.

07:20:41.629 --> 07:20:43.090
We have a motion and a second.

07:20:44.051 --> 07:20:45.212
All in favor, raise your hand.

07:20:45.232 --> 07:20:49.395
Okay, that carries unanimously and the board is adjourned.

07:20:51.697 --> 07:20:56.842
Thank you, Cindy.

07:20:56.882 --> 07:20:58.163
Yes, bravo, Cindy.

07:20:58.183 --> 07:20:58.643
Amazing.

07:20:59.044 --> 07:21:02.347
Thank you, Cindy.

07:21:03.307 --> 07:21:03.688
Amazing.
