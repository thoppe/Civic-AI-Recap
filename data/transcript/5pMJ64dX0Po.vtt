WEBVTT

00:00.967 --> 00:04.339
The State Board will convene and begin with a salute to the flag.

00:24.454 --> 00:27.438
Our first item today will be the report of the superintendent.

00:27.558 --> 00:31.282
And then I understand that board member Gray will also make some comments.

00:33.144 --> 00:34.806
Thank you, President Kirsten, board members.

00:34.846 --> 00:35.247
Good morning.

00:37.165 --> 00:49.375
This is a special day, a National Student Action Day, to express our grief for the victims of gun violence and to show solidarity as we work together with our students for change.

00:50.536 --> 00:57.963
Later this morning, students all across California, all across America, will remember the high school shooting victims in Florida.

00:59.544 --> 01:02.747
He will also remember victims of gun violence in San Bernardino and Rancho Tama.

01:04.534 --> 01:09.817
We have all been deeply affected by these tragedies, and our hearts and prayers are with the victims and their families.

01:11.277 --> 01:20.762
I look forward to continuing to support all students who want to talk about and act about improving and expanding school safety, who want to take action against gun violence.

01:21.603 --> 01:27.246
Thank you to the students who are conducting on-campus discussions today across California and across America.

01:28.346 --> 01:33.692
I have issued a superintendent's letter expressing solidarity with the Florida victims from Stoneman Douglas High School.

01:34.674 --> 01:43.464
And for educators, this will be an opportunity to understand the range of students' feelings and their goals and ideas for reducing senseless gun violence.

01:44.865 --> 01:52.067
For students, they will also learn civic participation and how to engage in dialogue about critical and often emotional issues.

01:53.287 --> 01:54.827
Last week, I was in Washington, D.C.

01:55.007 --> 02:01.689
for meetings on our California State Plan, our ESSA plan, and I asked our federal officials in Washington, D.C.

02:02.149 --> 02:06.730
and all members of Congress to listen to the strong and powerful messages from our students.

02:07.390 --> 02:10.611
They want safe campuses as a top, top priority.

02:11.551 --> 02:18.734
In a few minutes, we will hear from our outstanding student board member, Jayden Gray, from James Logan High School.

02:19.495 --> 02:30.340
And Jayden, you remind me of so many of my students over the years who wanted to make a difference, who got involved, who took the time to support important social causes, and I thank you for that.

02:30.480 --> 02:34.302
And this is the time your voices will be heard.

02:35.282 --> 02:46.206
Thank you to California teachers, administrators, and staff for providing opportunities for all students to remember those who died and for providing ways for all students to express their views on the tragic event.

02:47.466 --> 02:56.089
I believe this will be an extension of the California safe havens discussions we have had here and around California, which have involved making our schools safe for all students and parents.

02:57.745 --> 03:17.601
Along with the Safe Havens outreach, two years ago, I convened a statewide school safety committee to implement ways we can better partner with our law enforcement agencies and our social service and health agencies to make sure that our schools are taking all the necessary steps to ensure the safety of students and that we are sharing our best practices while doing so.

03:19.182 --> 03:26.287
We must ensure that we are addressing the health and wellness needs of all of our students, reaching and teaching the whole child.

03:27.130 --> 03:38.577
I believe it is imperative that we provide more mental health services for students and I look forward to working with the legislature on funding greater mental health services right here in California and counseling services with that.

03:39.617 --> 03:42.819
It won't be easy, it won't happen overnight, but I know we can do it.

03:43.259 --> 03:44.400
We can do it together.

03:45.199 --> 03:52.544
And I'm proud of the more than 61 California Teachers of the Year, the best of our best teachers, who signed an open letter with me to President Trump.

03:53.204 --> 03:58.508
I have spoken to these dedicated teachers and know of their determination to work with our students to truly make a difference.

03:59.448 --> 04:03.431
The letter says loud and clear, we do not need more guns in our school campuses.

04:03.871 --> 04:08.655
We need more mental health services, smaller class sizes, more counselors, more school nurses.

04:09.395 --> 04:22.957
and more training for all faculty and personnel on how to detect students in crisis or students who may be depressed or may be suicidal or who might think the answer to their problems is violence against other students.

04:24.440 --> 04:29.743
I know the commitment we see today, this dedication of making positive change will keep moving forward.

04:30.543 --> 04:35.266
Please join rallies that will be happening all across California and all across America on March 24th.

04:36.146 --> 04:41.209
And you can access on a website where the rally would be, the march in your particular part of California.

04:42.682 --> 04:47.786
I will be joining the March for Our Lives rally in Walnut Creek and I look forward to spreading the same message to everyone.

04:47.806 --> 04:51.149
Again, just check the website for those locations.

04:51.189 --> 04:58.956
We will keep on supporting our students who want to spread the word about these important messages and I do believe together we will make a difference.

04:59.236 --> 05:00.477
We can and we will make a difference.

05:01.177 --> 05:04.020
And I now want to turn to Jayden to have a

05:05.141 --> 05:22.479
Leader and the student voice of California to share his views Jaden um I'd first like to begin by really just sending my deepest condolences to all the students in Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and And really everyone affected by the tragedy.

05:23.600 --> 05:26.964
I think for students in particular this

05:28.425 --> 05:32.508
tragedy hit so close to home because of the prevalence of social media.

05:32.589 --> 05:40.935
I remember scrolling down my Twitter feed and just my Instagram and social media and seeing live tweets from the students at the high school.

05:41.416 --> 05:43.738
And it made it so much more firsthand.

05:43.798 --> 05:46.720
It felt as if you could experience their emotions.

05:47.701 --> 05:55.707
I remember students tweeting from the high school as the shooting was happening, how they were fearing for their lives, how their friends had been shot, videos of

05:56.568 --> 05:59.871
of students lying dead in classroom floors.

06:00.471 --> 06:06.556
And I think that hit very close to home for me and for students all across the nation.

06:08.537 --> 06:11.019
And I think if there's a silver lining in any of this

06:12.057 --> 06:16.881
It is the action and the response of students all across the nation.

06:19.523 --> 06:28.090
I think it really shows the ability that students have to catalyze change and the power that students have even at such a young age.

06:30.693 --> 06:40.219
Today, all across the nation, from Florida to California, there will be 17 minute walkouts in honor of the 17 lives that were lost.

06:41.320 --> 06:53.989
And we, as students, are standing in solidarity and we, as students, are fighting to show that we can never allow something like what happened in Parkland, Florida, to happen again.

06:54.009 --> 06:55.450
So, just,

07:00.533 --> 07:12.677
If I could say one thing, it's just for everyone who's out there today, be safe, kick butt, stand strong, and today we are all MSD strong.

07:12.877 --> 07:13.537
So, thank you.

07:21.021 --> 07:22.101
Thank you very much for that.

07:23.462 --> 07:25.782
Board members, we have a long meeting today.

07:25.982 --> 07:32.423
Our staff projects it at 11 hours, so you'll need your stamina to do that.

07:32.664 --> 07:37.224
And before we begin with item one, I have some unusual announcements.

07:37.745 --> 07:43.486
We have two new people joining our staff, and so I'm pleased to announce that

07:44.494 --> 07:49.376
Lila Fahimadeen joined the State Board beginning on February 20th.

07:49.796 --> 08:00.401
Lila has excellent experience for us, having worked prior for the National Center for Youth Law, SRI International, and ACLU.

08:01.041 --> 08:09.844
And she'll be working on projects and policy on special education and English learner issues as one of her areas of portfolio.

08:09.944 --> 08:13.526
So Lila, will you stand up there and welcome Lila.

08:18.789 --> 08:27.183
Secondly, I'm delighted to announce that longtime person who's been interacting with the board, Terry Burns.

08:28.167 --> 08:30.749
We'll be joining the state board staff in March.

08:31.869 --> 08:38.473
Terry is currently the senior director and legislative advocate for the California School Boards Association.

08:39.473 --> 08:48.678
And she's been a board member, a school board member at Natomas Unified School District for the last 33 years.

08:50.419 --> 08:53.981
She has had an illustrious career in Sacramento.

08:54.531 --> 09:04.603
including a consultant in the State Senate, and she was the Chief Deputy of the State Education Department under Superintendent Jack O'Connell.

09:04.983 --> 09:06.345
I'm not sure Terry's here.

09:06.585 --> 09:07.266
She is here.

09:07.306 --> 09:07.967
There she is.

09:07.987 --> 09:08.568
Yes, thank you.

09:13.975 --> 09:29.366
Our big change for the day on our agenda is that the ESSA state plan item posted yesterday includes key areas of the ESSA plan, including weighting of indicators and school identification.

09:30.687 --> 09:31.968
During the timing of

09:33.011 --> 09:37.173
the completion of our negotiations with the U.S.

09:37.193 --> 09:38.393
Department of Education.

09:39.714 --> 09:48.778
We have not had time for a public reaction to this agreement, and so we modified our recommendation on item 4.

09:50.278 --> 10:13.874
We are requesting, and the CDE requests, and I think the Board should go along, that we defer action on Title I accountability items in the revised state plan so that it can be considered at a subsequent State Board of Education meeting to be scheduled in order for stakeholder feedback and some issues around the impact analysis.

10:14.594 --> 10:15.295
of the changes.

10:15.855 --> 10:19.017
So we will announce the date as soon as it is finalized.

10:20.158 --> 10:24.221
We expect it to be roughly within a month of this meeting.

10:24.321 --> 10:30.206
So we will have an additional meeting in this calendar year of the State Board of Education.

10:31.607 --> 10:34.689
There are six public hearings on our agenda.

10:35.270 --> 10:35.490
Items 5, 6, 20, 21, 22, 23.

10:35.670 --> 10:36.951
The waiver and consent calendars.

10:43.261 --> 10:50.048
are there including consent items 11 through 19 and waiver items W2 and W4 through W15.

10:50.068 --> 10:58.357
We have items 11 through 19 are our regular consent items.

11:03.402 --> 11:17.128
And I want to remind board members, if you wish to remove an item from our consent calendar, please do so by Wednesday morning today at 12.30.

11:18.609 --> 11:23.932
My usual announcements, we have a fully accessible

11:26.044 --> 11:38.309
Electronic agenda, the public comment for items not on our agenda will be limited to one minute per speaker at the end of tomorrow's meeting.

11:39.409 --> 11:47.653
If you're going to give something to the state board to read while you're speaking, please provide 25 copies to Amy Bubico at the desk in the front.

11:49.273 --> 11:55.076
Please, if you're speaking to us, introduce yourself and the organization that you represent.

11:56.196 --> 12:12.180
We have additional seating and TV monitors in adjacent rooms 1130 1103 and 1801 around the corner And we will have some board member recusals later.

12:12.260 --> 12:23.782
So the board members will remember that so that is I think the preliminaries and so we're now ready for a multi item and

12:24.832 --> 12:31.898
Item 1, which is around accountability and continuous improvement at this local, state, and federal level.

12:33.099 --> 12:37.723
This is a multifaceted item of related but separate issues.

12:38.423 --> 12:50.113
So I think it's best if members ask questions after each of the substantive items so we don't mush them all together and make them unclear for the audience.

12:50.879 --> 12:59.407
So we're now ready with item one and Cindy Kazanis for the department will be the lead presenter and we have some illustrious guests.

13:03.973 --> 13:08.996
Good morning, Superintendent, oh, good morning, President Kirst and Superintendent Torlakson and members of the board.

13:09.036 --> 13:12.038
It's my pleasure to present item one today.

13:12.058 --> 13:19.043
There's, as President Kirst indicated, there's quite a few pieces to this and we'll have quite a few presenters as well.

13:19.463 --> 13:23.786
I'm Cindy Kazanis, the Director of the Analysis, Measurement and Accountability Reporting Division.

13:24.647 --> 13:29.750
And to get started, just quickly, sorry, it feels like I have an echo.

13:30.331 --> 13:33.633
Okay, so maybe we'll just take a quick pause.

13:39.608 --> 13:41.068
Or perhaps I should keep talking.

13:41.748 --> 13:44.969
Does it seem like it's gone to you?

13:46.129 --> 13:46.949
Someone?

13:47.370 --> 13:47.470
OK.

13:48.010 --> 13:48.310
All right.

13:48.410 --> 13:52.531
So we have five attachments in this item.

13:52.651 --> 13:56.171
And we'll take up, obviously, each of them, for the most part, individually.

13:56.211 --> 13:58.852
The last two will be combined together.

13:59.652 --> 14:04.793
There are two, or rather three, recommendations, but two really for action in this item.

14:05.393 --> 14:25.128
We're recommending that the State Board of Education approve first the proposed revision to the self-reflection tool for priority six, which is the school climate local indicator, and then number two, the proposed standard and self-assessment tool for local educational agencies to determine progress on the local performance indicator for priority seven, which is access to broad course of study.

14:26.229 --> 14:38.296
The CDE is asking and recommending that the State Board of Education provide guidance on recommended changes or rather recommended changes to the state indicator and take additional action as deemed necessary and appropriate.

14:38.656 --> 14:48.242
And I'm going to talk through what we mean by that last piece after our guest speakers today because I think there's been some confusion about whether or not it's a recommendation or not per se.

14:50.043 --> 15:01.249
So just as a very high-level reminder, you have been at this for a number of meetings, maybe up to two dozen by now, working on our accountability and our continuous improvement system.

15:01.609 --> 15:13.835
And it's been over a year, really, that you've approved the evaluation rubrics, and this month marks the official release of the beta test of our dashboard, which was released last year in March.

15:14.995 --> 15:31.306
In September, you approved changes, but one thing I wanted to mention for March, this has been our annual time in which we set aside for you to look at our work plan and look at the work that will go into the release for fall, which is going to be our annual release of the dashboard.

15:32.006 --> 15:45.663
Back in November, you also made changes to the academic indicator and you approved the inclusion of chronic absentees and data only on the dashboard released for last December, which was released on December 7th.

15:48.004 --> 15:53.627
So to start us off, it seemed to go really well last time, so I'm sure it'll be just as great.

15:53.707 --> 15:55.568
We're going to hear from a local educational agency.

15:55.988 --> 16:03.772
So to get us started, I would like to invite up our two guest speakers who have traveled with us from the Bay Area, from Castro Valley Unified School District.

16:04.213 --> 16:07.074
Joe Loss is their president of the board of Castro Valley.

16:07.474 --> 16:08.275
Please come on up.

16:09.015 --> 16:12.197
And their superintendent, Parvin Parvin.

16:14.177 --> 16:15.018
Thank you.

16:22.901 --> 16:23.341
Thank you.

16:24.261 --> 16:24.941
Good morning.

16:24.961 --> 16:41.868
I also would like to start by sharing my deep condolence to the victims of the Florida shooting and also commend our young people who have really

16:42.828 --> 16:49.512
reminded me lately over and over again of the hope that I have for our future because of their advocacy.

16:50.313 --> 16:57.938
I'm Parveen Amadi, the superintendent for Castavel Unified School District and this is our wonderful board president Joe Loss.

16:58.458 --> 16:59.879
Good morning.

16:59.899 --> 17:08.865
25 years of experience on the board so I'm very fortunate to have to work for Joe Loss and the rest of the board members so

17:10.626 --> 17:26.881
Today we hope to share with you just a few things about what we have really focused on with the California dashboard and hope that if you have any questions you can feel free to ask us.

17:27.562 --> 17:32.326
The topic is utilizing California's new accountability dashboard to improve our practice.

17:33.413 --> 17:49.031
So the first step is that the board needs to value and honor their responsibility that comes with the dashboard because there's accountability for the board and it requires the board to accept the responsibility for their actions.

17:49.992 --> 17:52.915
Boards have to respect the diversity of the dashboard

17:53.311 --> 17:57.535
data and account for their actions by using the dashboard.

17:58.176 --> 18:06.123
Boards should use the dashboard to determine the district's direction, setting goals, and establishing expectations.

18:06.644 --> 18:11.649
These are for the board, the staff, the district, and the students.

18:12.247 --> 18:19.831
The dashboard should be a guide for allocating resources and the backbone of all policy development.

18:20.591 --> 18:31.737
Board members should be vocal and visible ambassadors throughout their communities to explain and educate that the dashboard is much more than a single numerical score.

18:34.141 --> 18:40.362
Board members need to do more than review their district's dashboard to make use of this valuable tool.

18:40.842 --> 18:49.744
My recommendation is that they spend some time learning about the ideas behind the dashboard to help keep their focus on what the tool can do for them.

18:50.284 --> 18:58.746
Then avoid the temptation to look at the details and start with an overview that highlights what is working well and where improvement is needed.

18:59.586 --> 19:06.572
I suggest that each board member take 10 minutes to examine their personal perspective and maybe their bias.

19:07.432 --> 19:13.056
Make a list of the indicators and have each member write down a prediction of the color that they'll see.

19:13.517 --> 19:17.920
Then look at their district's dashboard and list the actual color received.

19:18.641 --> 19:19.702
Are there surprises?

19:20.442 --> 19:25.306
It's really important that everyone knows whether their personal impressions are accurate or not

19:25.706 --> 19:30.610
before they start asking questions and certainly before making board decisions.

19:31.110 --> 19:42.118
Then I recommend that each team take a few minutes to chart the performance gaps for each indicator with only personal thoughts and anecdotal knowledge.

19:42.919 --> 19:45.621
Now the team is prepared with the information that

19:46.281 --> 19:54.826
helps define their personal beliefs and are ready to work with the staff for data to inform and guide their decisions.

19:55.346 --> 20:03.691
And of course, boards must demonstrate the steps that ensure forward motion, monitor, evaluate, and adjust as necessary.

20:04.511 --> 20:11.659
The dashboard unites all of the governance team's efforts in shaping the educational experience of the students.

20:12.160 --> 20:20.609
The work that the board does in understanding the dashboard results and implementing improvement is the basis for all work for the governance team.

20:21.170 --> 20:24.574
When a nexus is reached with the alignment of the strategic plan,

20:25.094 --> 20:35.355
district goals and budget, board members will have the answer for any and all questions and the very tough decisions that they have to make at the board table.

20:37.967 --> 20:52.354
So we'll start the conversation about what we've done with the dashboard in our school district by kind of sharing with you, as President Law said, our strategic plan really guides our work in our school district.

20:52.754 --> 20:58.657
And it's aligned with our LCAP, which has been our guiding force and our school plans.

20:59.197 --> 21:04.480
But I believe that our commitment to equity by all is key for us.

21:05.360 --> 21:20.450
I have brought brochures, and in the brochure you will notice our strategic plan, our vision, mission, statement, and core values, and a real focus on the whole concept and motto of all means all.

21:21.071 --> 21:34.360
In fact, you will see it everywhere in our school district, in our schools, on our website, to remind us every day that that all means all should be the focus when we look at every decision.

21:35.320 --> 21:45.627
And our belief is that every system, as I'm sure you have heard and seen this, that is perfectly designed for the results that it gets.

21:46.107 --> 22:01.698
So through a systems thinking approach, the past few years we've tried really hard to focus our efforts on the connection between the parts of the system and using systems thinking tools to look deeper at all of our work.

22:02.478 --> 22:06.745
Our strategic plan is basically our roadmap.

22:07.846 --> 22:18.042
We believe in empowering and engaging families and the community, and I'll share some things about that with you, and we encourage student voice and engagement at all levels.

22:21.324 --> 22:29.351
When we talk about using systems thinking tools to examine patterns and plans for improvement, these are some of the questions that we have in mind.

22:29.892 --> 22:33.975
So what are the overall trends and patterns when we look at the dashboard?

22:34.576 --> 22:46.167
It is really easy for us to just look at the green and blue for any of our districts and just kind of move on and be happy about the fact that we have green and blues.

22:47.227 --> 22:50.048
But we really need to look at the trends and patterns.

22:50.468 --> 22:53.449
What are some of the specific patterns that we see and change over time?

22:53.810 --> 22:58.931
What are the mental models in existence that may have led to current results?

22:59.392 --> 23:04.873
And that's key, using that tool to look at why we make certain decisions.

23:05.294 --> 23:06.734
What are the structures in place?

23:06.794 --> 23:08.695
What are the patterns that we see?

23:08.795 --> 23:10.876
But what's the mental model under that?

23:11.336 --> 23:14.077
What are some of the steps taken to address areas of concerns?

23:15.317 --> 23:26.106
Our district goals and LCAP goals and priorities in our strategic plan align in all sorts of ways, including how our funding decisions are made.

23:26.506 --> 23:30.329
Are we seeing expected outcomes based on what has been in place?

23:30.730 --> 23:31.731
What are the outcomes?

23:31.811 --> 23:37.836
We can have a lot of different initiatives, but if we're not looking at outcomes, we're really missing the point.

23:38.496 --> 23:40.478
What are some of the examples of best practices?

23:40.538 --> 23:41.839
We don't have all the answers.

23:42.619 --> 23:46.620
And what are the different parts of the systems that we need to connect?

23:47.461 --> 23:50.942
And then are there things that we've been doing that are not effective?

23:51.762 --> 23:57.344
And then are there new things that we need to be doing and stop doing things that are not effective?

23:57.704 --> 24:01.965
And that's one of the top four decisions because everybody loves their program.

24:02.205 --> 24:03.246
That's right.

24:04.006 --> 24:13.071
And I think that having our strategic plan and a governing board that is focused on equity is the key to making those decisions.

24:13.671 --> 24:15.352
So the dashboard is out.

24:15.752 --> 24:16.913
Now what?

24:17.674 --> 24:21.396
You know, to me, the most important piece is peeling it back.

24:23.036 --> 24:26.398
Confirm and deeply analyze other data sources.

24:27.339 --> 24:38.425
When you think about the API versus the dashboard, I always feel that real estate agents love the API because it was one number.

24:39.545 --> 24:46.128
I remember families would come to us and say, well, I don't want to go to that school, I want to go to this school, because they were five points away.

24:46.828 --> 24:50.730
Well, it really didn't mean a whole lot when you looked deeply.

24:51.010 --> 24:57.413
The dashboard actually allows us to take a deeper look at things, but people can also misuse the dashboard.

24:57.933 --> 25:04.276
and just look at the green and the blue versus peeling it back for even the blue and the green to see what's under it.

25:04.917 --> 25:05.937
Are there any areas?

25:06.597 --> 25:10.399
What groups of students are not being served as well as they should be?

25:10.679 --> 25:11.660
What else can we do?

25:12.400 --> 25:17.923
So some of the things that we use in our school district to make sure that we deeply analyze the data

25:18.343 --> 25:27.777
We have Illuminate, which many districts have, the data management system that includes all of our assessments, formative assessments, and all sorts of things.

25:29.179 --> 25:31.202
SWIS has been really effective for us.

25:31.362 --> 25:33.225
We have positive behavior intervention.

25:34.807 --> 25:37.351
actually throughout our entire school district.

25:38.873 --> 25:52.391
And the data system called SWIS, Schoolwide Information System, has been very effective in identifying patterns of behavior and referrals and when they're happening, where,

25:52.951 --> 25:57.595
by whom all of those things, groups of students that we need to serve better.

25:58.415 --> 26:06.902
The California Healthy Kids Survey for us has been really effective this year because we actually gave it at the beginning of the year instead of at the end of the year.

26:06.942 --> 26:11.926
And because the results come back in a couple of weeks, it's been an effective tool to use as well.

26:12.286 --> 26:15.509
Aries is our grades, attendance, and discipline, and a lot more.

26:16.569 --> 26:21.914
And using common assessments based on essential standards that our teachers have identified.

26:22.674 --> 26:52.074
formatively and actually collaboratively working in professional learning communities for our teachers to look at their plans, look at the results of their formative assessments, and then go back and talk about what are things that have worked for one teacher, groups of students, and how do we then use that model to have interventions during the day because the most important interventions should happen during the day.

26:52.734 --> 26:59.398
and then examine our support systems already in place and plan steps to improve them.

26:59.518 --> 27:15.087
I can use a lot of examples that we've had, but again, as you look at the accountability tool, I think it's really, really important to look at the indicators, at the colors, and the green, blue, yellow, orange, and red,

27:15.687 --> 27:39.271
But also take a look at the five by five, the matrix, because that's when you look for each school to see, you know, for example, for us, one of our title one schools, Cast Valley Elementary, I was actually working with our secretaries and clerks about, you know, talking about inclusive environments and how do we

27:40.091 --> 28:09.431
As a office staff actually are the face of the school and they're they're just amazing people that support our families and We were going over the dashboard I think that's a really important piece as well to make sure none of you are part of our system is left out our Classified members as well as our teachers, but when I showed them, you know different schools and they looked at for example, Castor Valley Elementary School and they said wow, it's green or it's blue and

28:10.352 --> 28:19.998
I had them, as President Law said, kind of, you know, think in their, just kind of write down a couple of things that they might see when we peel it back.

28:21.018 --> 28:27.303
And our perceptions, and biases about all of that, and that's, we've done that with our teachers and administrators.

28:27.683 --> 28:36.909
When you peel it back, they all loved it and clapped when they saw that Castaveli Elementary School had green for every one of their groups of students.

28:38.069 --> 28:43.852
in all areas, including discipline, which has been an area of concern for us, frankly.

28:44.633 --> 28:52.456
And that, again, was really important to see that there are things that people have in place that are actually effective.

28:53.157 --> 29:00.841
And if families moved in and asked which school to go to, I'm very confident to say any of our schools.

29:02.322 --> 29:07.272
I would feel the same that our board members could say that.

29:10.091 --> 29:23.775
You know, I think the important piece also about our work in, I'm going to go back, with the dashboard is all of the things that we've put in place.

29:23.835 --> 29:28.616
When we talk about taking deep dives, for example, we looked at our discipline data.

29:29.916 --> 29:34.338
And when we looked at our discipline data, we were very concerned that we

29:35.738 --> 29:36.959
are not where we need to be.

29:38.099 --> 29:39.400
But we didn't just stop there.

29:39.460 --> 29:46.182
We actually used Swiss data and all of our data with suspension and looked at patterns.

29:46.822 --> 29:50.724
When were these happening at our high school, for example?

29:51.164 --> 29:52.325
What were the infractions?

29:52.905 --> 29:58.027
What were student groups being disciplined for?

29:58.647 --> 30:14.311
And what we found out were some pretty simple things that, for example, if students were not, you know, had a detention to finish something and didn't come, they were given Saturday school.

30:14.591 --> 30:18.251
And if they didn't come to Saturday school, then they would be suspended.

30:18.912 --> 30:20.132
That just makes no sense.

30:21.152 --> 30:24.233
But that was something that had been in place for a long, long time.

30:24.493 --> 30:25.033
So we said,

30:27.269 --> 30:28.529
We know that's not effective.

30:28.890 --> 30:33.092
We want students in school, so that's our goal, keeping students at school.

30:33.573 --> 30:36.975
Just that simple thing changed a whole lot of stuff.

30:37.335 --> 30:39.157
Then we looked at our Swiss data to see.

30:39.717 --> 30:45.061
I have to say I'm pleased to see that our teachers are not sending children out of their classrooms.

30:45.701 --> 30:48.002
They're actually supporting them within the classroom.

30:48.943 --> 30:58.945
But what was happening are things outside of school that we actually have some control over, and then the rest of it is our work with the community and parents.

31:00.045 --> 31:08.667
Our culturally and responsive teaching methods and practices that we've had with Cherokee Holly, we've had to bring some of those things back.

31:09.047 --> 31:18.169
We just had every one of our teachers in our district and administrators trained with Mike Matos, who is a guru of response to intervention.

31:19.009 --> 31:21.592
We're looking at our schedules.

31:22.132 --> 31:30.320
We have an equity task force that includes, it's almost half students and the other half are staff and parents.

31:30.981 --> 31:41.471
As we're looking at our adoption of materials, following the FAIR Act, we have students and community members involved in the selection process.

31:42.131 --> 31:49.557
We have a district student leadership alliance who we have formed in the last three years and we've taken them to conferences for systems thinking.

31:50.037 --> 31:52.279
They are our ears and eyes.

31:52.660 --> 31:57.103
They meet with me and advise us in an advisory role.

31:57.123 --> 31:58.985
They tell us things that we need to do better.

31:59.685 --> 32:02.428
We have noticed the need for mental health support.

32:03.248 --> 32:06.231
It's huge in our school districts and all over the country.

32:06.751 --> 32:07.412
We know that.

32:07.952 --> 32:26.208
We looked at our budget cuts for next year, and we actually had a grant for counseling for elementary school that was running out, a federal grant, and the board and the community was very interested in keeping that, so we went back to find ways to keep our elementary counselors.

32:27.049 --> 32:29.831
We also have a wellness center that we've started.

32:30.211 --> 32:42.899
One of the other things we've done is any student who has an infraction, before they're suspended obviously with the conversation, they make a visit to the wellness center because we have many, many organizations that are at our wellness center.

32:44.079 --> 32:45.300
ready to support students.

32:45.660 --> 32:47.261
So there's a whole lot to talk about.

32:47.701 --> 32:54.865
I know that I just have a few, a couple of seconds more to say our parent projects have been key.

32:55.425 --> 32:59.548
PK, Parent Institute for Quality Education, and School Smarts.

33:00.270 --> 33:00.871
for students.

33:01.271 --> 33:17.067
And during our mariachi program, we have students who are actually in learning from classically trained musicians while their parents are in training and being given information on topics of interest.

33:17.447 --> 33:20.790
So these are just some of the things we've done, but I would sum it up by

33:21.958 --> 33:35.246
district who's serious about closing the opportunity gap must be relentless, must have a relentless, focused, targeted effort to close that gap and include everyone in that decision-making.

33:36.006 --> 33:37.747
All of us need to be responsible.

33:38.648 --> 33:39.048
Thank you.

33:39.508 --> 33:39.908
Thank you.

33:45.817 --> 33:55.292
President Chris, did you want to open it up for a brief question since we're here and we'll hand out the brochures while you're okay.

33:55.312 --> 33:55.793
Thank you.

33:56.033 --> 34:00.400
All right, Board Member Strauss and Board Member Rucker.

34:01.983 --> 34:09.126
I want to thank you both for coming and taking time out of your very busy day, particularly today with all the things are happening in local school districts.

34:09.506 --> 34:13.508
And just thank you for your quick but comprehensive approach.

34:13.548 --> 34:18.290
And I think you really show us and show the public that it's not a simple approach.

34:18.330 --> 34:22.491
It's a comprehensive approach and that you're really addressing it from a variety of directions.

34:22.611 --> 34:23.812
I love your all means all.

34:24.652 --> 34:32.759
And I just want to thank you for the specifics that you provided about how does the dashboard influence and inform your decision making and your actions.

34:32.859 --> 34:34.421
So very comprehensive.

34:34.441 --> 34:37.143
I appreciate some of the slides that you shared.

34:37.163 --> 34:40.446
I know it was a really tight timeline for you, which we appreciate.

34:40.726 --> 34:48.873
But again, for particularly today and for taking theory to practice and helping to inform and offer a model for other districts to follow.

34:48.953 --> 34:49.874
So thank you very much.

34:50.395 --> 34:50.735
Thank you.

34:51.235 --> 34:51.916
Board Member Rucker.

34:52.659 --> 34:56.021
Well, I also want to echo what Board Member Strauss has said.

34:56.061 --> 34:56.921
Joe, I want to say hi.

34:56.961 --> 34:58.582
It's been quite a while since I've seen you.

34:58.622 --> 35:03.104
We go back a long way, so I'm very proud of the work that Castro Valley is doing.

35:03.424 --> 35:13.929
And what I really appreciate in your, albeit brief, but very in-depth presentation, I've heard from a lot of districts in the time I've been on this board about the efforts they've made

35:14.329 --> 35:24.758
to implement the dashboard and to use it to inform their LCAP, and they use all these highfalutin terms about implementation and what informs their practice.

35:25.119 --> 35:38.790
What I really appreciate is in the work that you presented today, you gave a deep explanation about, as a stakeholder from the board, what it really looks like to do a deeper dive, what systems thinking really means.

35:38.830 --> 35:40.252
I've heard a lot of districts say

35:40.652 --> 35:47.114
that they're doing systems thinking and then when they give their presentation and the explanation about the work they're doing, they're not.

35:47.554 --> 36:00.758
So I really appreciate not only the questions that you pose, but how the questions have meaning to truly inform what your conversations look like and how you study and analyze not only your performance gap,

36:01.218 --> 36:02.959
but the expectations gap.

36:03.239 --> 36:16.682
And this is really the first time I've actually heard a district talk about not only what their performance looks like, but what they expected their performance to be and how that informed a lot of what they wrote in their LCAPs.

36:17.102 --> 36:22.204
And so in preparation for your presentation, I also looked back and read your LCAP.

36:22.584 --> 36:24.544
Your LCAP has become more thoughtful.

36:25.164 --> 36:26.325
I hope that's a compliment.

36:28.140 --> 36:35.308
from where we started in developing and writing LCAPS, and it's informed and shows up from the work that you presented today.

36:35.348 --> 36:40.974
So I am very pleased and very thankful that you came here to give us this model and to show us what you're doing.

36:41.515 --> 36:41.955
Thank you.

36:42.516 --> 36:42.937
Thank you.

36:43.177 --> 36:43.537
Thank you.

36:44.118 --> 36:45.019
Board member Valdez.

36:48.147 --> 36:48.488
Good morning.

36:48.528 --> 37:00.981
I just want to thank you and I really want to highlight the partnership between the governing board and the district leadership really having the same vision and working towards all means all and I think that that is a model that not all districts have.

37:01.001 --> 37:09.170
So the health of your district is very high in your ability to be able to work and get this is a heavy lift and you're doing great work.

37:09.210 --> 37:09.631
So thank you.

37:10.491 --> 37:11.412
Thank you so much.

37:11.472 --> 37:19.420
The heavy lift is when you're at the meeting and you keep, in my case, looking around to say, when's the grown-up going to come and handle this?

37:20.161 --> 37:22.343
And then I realize that I'm the grown-up.

37:24.025 --> 37:28.109
But we have the data and the material to support the decisions we're making.

37:29.100 --> 37:42.287
Just one thing I have to say, I have to give kudos to the board for allowing us to go through an entire year in developing that strategic plan through listening campaigns.

37:42.347 --> 37:44.868
We listened to 26 groups in the community.

37:45.368 --> 37:52.953
We partnered with board members and took the whole year so that our strategic plan is a community strategic plan.

37:53.033 --> 37:59.077
And our community alliance we have just recently formed with many organizations has been amazing.

37:59.357 --> 38:02.459
It was in response to some racial slurs at one of our schools.

38:03.059 --> 38:06.403
and we sent out an invitation and said this is a community issue.

38:06.763 --> 38:20.057
They've all come together, we meet, and we have a social justice series of films, and our students are doing season of service period of peace, which we can talk about a lot, but they're leading it, they're amazing.

38:20.077 --> 38:23.901
Board member Sandoval.

38:25.828 --> 38:26.068
Thank you.

38:26.128 --> 38:29.951
You've painted a beautiful picture of how this is really working, so thank you.

38:30.631 --> 38:43.100
I really appreciated your discussion of your philosophy on suspension and how you were willing to take a good, honest look at an old practice that just made no sense today.

38:43.881 --> 38:50.866
And that you are doing everything you can, and everyone's committed to keeping our students in the classroom, which is where they need to be.

38:51.666 --> 39:03.452
and the work of the Wellness Center, too, in making sure that that is part of a comprehensive response to these behaviors that we're seeing, and also that it's a community strategic plan.

39:03.593 --> 39:11.337
It absolutely is, because in schools we can't do it alone, and it really takes a whole community to work together to move things forward.

39:11.357 --> 39:12.257
So thank you for the work.

39:12.277 --> 39:13.158
It was very inspiring.

39:13.218 --> 39:14.378
Great way to start our morning.

39:14.438 --> 39:14.778
Thank you.

39:14.858 --> 39:15.639
Thank you very much.

39:21.288 --> 39:21.688
Thank you.

39:21.808 --> 39:23.230
I also want to say hi to Joe.

39:23.250 --> 39:24.451
I appreciate you being here.

39:25.613 --> 39:33.242
The thing I most appreciated and wanted to highlight was the contrast between what the API used to look like and what you have now.

39:34.003 --> 39:38.529
Because I think all of us have a hard time with change and there are many, many constituent groups

39:38.849 --> 39:43.210
that still would like us to smush everything together and say, here's what it means.

39:43.851 --> 40:00.456
And your example of parents or community members who say, well, I went to Southern School because there was five points difference, really highlights how imperfect the API was, especially because it was based just on test scores, as you know, a little bit on graduation rates later on.

40:01.156 --> 40:14.644
And you really did a beautiful job, as Board Member Sandoval said, you painted a beautiful picture of what it means to have multiple measures and how you have to go about using them and then allow that data to help you make the decision.

40:14.684 --> 40:17.306
So I just wanted to say thank you very much for highlighting that.

40:22.938 --> 40:37.189
I also want to thank you for the presentation and I think what stood out to me was when you mentioned Sharaki Hawley and I know that if you mentioned Dr. Hawley that means that you knew there was a special need to bring someone with expertise around African-American students and restorative justice.

40:37.530 --> 40:41.113
So I appreciate the attention to specific subgroups in this presentation.

40:41.553 --> 40:41.893
Thank you.

40:47.318 --> 40:51.301
Thank you for coming to us and now we're ready for the second part of this.

40:54.582 --> 40:59.188
We're going to jump out of our PowerPoint presentation and show you a brief video.

40:59.208 --> 41:00.650
I'm going to just queue it up.

41:08.260 --> 41:09.701
Actually, let me introduce it first.

41:10.361 --> 41:18.085
So this video was produced as part of a project through the Alliance for Continuous Improvement and the Californians Dedicated Education Foundation.

41:18.606 --> 41:31.393
They worked with partners such as Californians for Justice, California State Parent Teacher Association, Alameda Unified School District, Redwood City School District, Downey Unified School District, Bay Area Parent Leadership Action

41:32.353 --> 41:35.854
Network, and the San Mateo County Office of Education and Achieve.

41:36.315 --> 41:42.317
And for this project, they convened six parent dashboard interactive sessions at different schools and venues.

41:42.697 --> 41:48.479
And at each session, diverse groups of parents and educators went online, used the new dashboard, and discussed what they found.

41:49.640 --> 41:54.122
They also found out ways that they could use the dashboard to engage in more local planning.

41:54.422 --> 41:57.123
They conducted one-on-one interviews with more than a dozen parents.

41:59.386 --> 42:05.170
And in doing so, they're compiling feedback to share with not only the Department of Education, but the State Board about parents' experiences.

42:05.891 --> 42:14.157
They're creating a series of videos featuring parents in their own words, telling other parents about the dashboard to encourage more people to check it out online and get involved in schools.

42:14.697 --> 42:16.518
This is a preview of the first video.

42:16.639 --> 42:18.280
This link is not yet public.

42:18.340 --> 42:20.241
They hope to make these public.

42:20.361 --> 42:23.864
I think later on this week, there'll be a large announcement around it, or early next week.

42:24.404 --> 42:42.778
And for those of you that know Joe Lost, you probably also know Paul Richman, and he is the gentleman behind this, and unfortunately was not able to be here today, but is very excited, and as are we, to show you this version of the video, and I believe they are translating some of these videos into Spanish as well, so I wanted to mention that too.

42:42.958 --> 42:44.900
It's a very short, less than three minute video.

42:45.856 --> 42:53.304
Parents are always interested to learn about how the schools are performing and how the students within the schools are performing.

42:53.324 --> 42:57.089
I don't think many of them know the dashboard exists.

43:04.861 --> 43:15.704
I like that you can look at the district as a whole, that you can look at one specific school, and you can look at different subgroups to see how they're performing, if they've increased, decreased.

43:16.104 --> 43:25.886
If English language learners are not progressing, then families could see that and they could go to the school and how can they help their students progress in English.

43:33.075 --> 43:36.976
I learned a lot about different schools and even my school.

43:37.656 --> 43:44.198
I didn't know exactly where we were at in our reading or in our English or in our suspensions and attendance.

43:44.698 --> 43:49.900
I liked being able to see the individual performances of the student subgroups.

43:50.140 --> 44:02.343
I work with special education advocacy groups, so it was helpful to see how the students with disabilities are doing, but also seeing how English language learners are doing and the Hispanic

44:02.543 --> 44:03.503
community as a whole.

44:03.803 --> 44:05.904
There was categories I didn't even know existed.

44:05.944 --> 44:19.848
I think it could be a super powerful tool for them to dive deeper into learning about not only how their children's schools are performing, but also how the schools throughout the whole district are performing.

44:20.248 --> 44:37.596
But just seeing the data and being able to compare and kind of selecting which way you want to view the data, like by this subgroup or by separate school sites, it's just another tool that we have to use so that we can advocate for what our students really need.

44:37.916 --> 44:45.379
As a parent, you want the best for your child, but you also do understand there's more to just your child.

44:45.799 --> 44:58.725
It's a community sense, and because it's part of your community, it's part of where you live, you want the program that your child is in not only to improve for them, but to improve for other children in the future.

45:23.140 --> 45:32.652
It reminded me to mention there were several students and I think some parents during the video that were on their phones and perhaps they were looking at the dashboard because it's now mobile responsive.

45:33.033 --> 45:40.143
But who knows, maybe they were looking at something else that was more relevant to the people around them.

45:40.903 --> 45:44.987
So with that, we're going to turn into some policy discussions.

45:45.768 --> 45:52.934
And I am going to turn over in just a minute to Jenny Singh, the Administrator of the Academic Accountability Unit, who's in my division.

45:53.715 --> 45:59.480
But just to frame the discussion, as I mentioned in the beginning, this is the beginning of what we call our work plan.

45:59.520 --> 46:07.547
So we are looking for feedback from you all to make sure that what we have planned ahead, which is based on feedback over the last year or two years from you all,

46:08.547 --> 46:09.468
is appropriate.

46:09.968 --> 46:19.171
This work plan represents what we have the resources to do and know we can get done in time for the fall or rather the dashboard in December.

46:20.011 --> 46:32.196
If for some reason something is not as high priority for you all or you want to add something to that workload, we would probably think about doing that for a parking lot for 2019.

46:33.576 --> 46:39.023
One of them that I think about that's come up time and time again is a high school readiness discussion, high school readiness indicator.

46:39.123 --> 46:48.295
In fact, Riverside County Office of Education came to visit us prior to this meeting trying to get it into the work plan and we simply said we have so many other things going on.

46:48.355 --> 46:50.778
If you were able to look at the last attachment,

46:51.679 --> 47:00.962
In this document, you would have seen just alone in the last two months, we have done five policy input sessions with our workgroups.

47:01.342 --> 47:08.424
That is not to say that we are fully engaged, but we are a small but mighty team.

47:08.744 --> 47:16.726
We want to make sure that we do the appropriate analysis to put something in the dashboard that is fair, reliable, and

47:17.726 --> 47:18.666
and equitable for all.

47:19.147 --> 47:23.868
So I do have colleagues in the room from our Career and College Transition Division.

47:24.268 --> 47:29.570
Donna Wyatt is here, Kristen Wright is here if you have questions about special education and their inclusion in the work plan.

47:29.910 --> 47:32.251
Michelle Senner's always here to talk about assessments.

47:32.671 --> 47:35.192
And then I think Veronica Aguilar was gonna come down as well.

47:35.612 --> 47:42.815
So with that in mind, I think we're ready to turn it over to Jenny.

47:50.248 --> 47:50.748
Good morning.

47:51.829 --> 47:52.970
Again, my name is Jenny Singh.

47:53.010 --> 48:05.058
I'm the administrator of the Academic Accountability Unit, and I just wanted to go briefly provide an overview of the information that is in Attachment 1 before we open it up for discussion.

48:05.538 --> 48:17.006
There's a lot of information in there, and I just wanted to remind everyone of the recommended changes that we are considering for the 2018 release.

48:17.726 --> 48:19.367
So first is chronic absenteeism.

48:21.308 --> 48:39.236
We were planning on bringing the status to the board this March, but we decided we needed to do a little more in-depth analysis of the data, so we're going to bring both status and change to the board in the fall for review, so you'll set status and change cut scores at the same time.

48:40.456 --> 48:42.359
We have the college and career indicator.

48:42.839 --> 48:46.564
We already have those status cut scores, and that information is on the web.

48:46.604 --> 48:51.390
We will be bringing recommended change cut scores between now and this summer.

48:52.011 --> 48:58.460
We also are going to be bringing some additional career measures that we want to add into the dashboard for the fall.

48:58.860 --> 49:01.103
We need to do some analysis.

49:01.443 --> 49:09.773
We're going to be doing a paper on the process that we use in order to determine if measures are valid and reliable and should be included in the dashboard.

49:10.133 --> 49:12.936
So, we'll be bringing that to you later on this summer.

49:14.497 --> 49:26.862
We've been working with our alternative schools task force on the dashboard alternative school status or DAS for alternative methods that we would want to add into the dashboard this fall.

49:27.382 --> 49:36.465
This is for schools that meet the criteria established by the board and we are using modified methods when appropriate for some of the indicators.

49:36.625 --> 49:40.807
So we do believe that we will be bringing a recommendation for a one-year graduation rate.

49:41.507 --> 49:45.008
and some modified career measures that would be available for DAS schools.

49:45.888 --> 49:47.609
We have our safety net methodology.

49:47.829 --> 49:52.030
You might recall that you approved that safety net methodology last year.

49:52.290 --> 49:56.051
We applied it to only two indicators, the graduation rate and the suspension rate.

49:56.471 --> 49:58.292
We did it at the school level only.

49:59.072 --> 50:10.355
We didn't have a lot of time to do in-depth analysis for student groups, but we are, potentially we want to add that three by five table for student groups in those two areas, in those two indicators.

50:12.233 --> 50:19.357
We have our student level growth model, which we've been talking about off and on for the last couple of years.

50:19.877 --> 50:25.040
We were very lucky to have our testing vendor, ETS, run some simulations for us.

50:25.100 --> 50:27.322
We provided a February memo for you on that.

50:27.962 --> 50:30.363
They did a simulation on three different models.

50:31.124 --> 50:41.550
We are going to be having some conversations, not only with our technical design group, but also with our stakeholders, and of course, some more in-depth conversations with the board as we move forward with this indicator.

50:43.197 --> 50:44.857
Our English Learner Progress Indicator.

50:46.198 --> 50:47.298
This should be no surprise.

50:47.678 --> 51:07.122
When we first did our methodology for this indicator, we did indicate that we are going to be having a new test, and that is the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California, or the LPAC, and we indicated when we first did the methodology using the CELF that we would have to, when we have a new test, we'd have to revisit that methodology.

51:07.882 --> 51:09.262
So we will be bringing that back.

51:09.302 --> 51:12.103
We are working very closely with our LP work group again,

51:12.903 --> 51:26.710
they'll be bringing forth some recommendations and it's very possible that they may want to do the same thing that we've done for chronic absenteeism and bring status and change to the board at the same time which means that we wouldn't be bringing that to you until 2019.

51:30.953 --> 51:33.675
We have the participation rate, which is required under ESSA.

51:34.215 --> 51:36.817
We have to incorporate that into our accountability system.

51:37.137 --> 51:41.200
We indicated we would develop some icons to display on our dashboard.

51:41.560 --> 51:45.343
We're working with our contractor at the Sacramento County Office of Education.

51:45.823 --> 51:54.669
And once we get some icons that we can share with our stakeholders, we can get their feedback and then bring that back to the board too before September.

51:55.689 --> 51:59.092
We are proposing to do a state-level dashboard report.

52:00.012 --> 52:05.196
You might recall that for the ESSA state plan, we produced some state-level data for some of our indicators.

52:05.276 --> 52:06.797
We got a lot of good feedback on that.

52:06.857 --> 52:15.103
People were really happy to see that data, and it asked us if we were planning on producing a state-level dashboard, so we said we would certainly put that on the list.

52:17.004 --> 52:18.805
We have our four-year graduation rate.

52:19.105 --> 52:23.388
This is the only indicator where we use a three-year average for change.

52:24.349 --> 52:32.814
We've talked several times with our technical design group on this and have determined that we really should use a one-year rate rather than a three-year rate.

52:33.714 --> 52:44.261
I know we had discussed previously that we were thinking about using a three-year rate for all indicators, but after conversations with our TDG, we decided we should actually do a one-year rate.

52:45.481 --> 52:57.124
We've had some conversation about a five-year graduation rate so this is one area where we are really asking for specific guidance from you today.

52:57.144 --> 53:12.649
We may not be able to incorporate the grad rate into the four-year indicator that we already have so we want to know if you want us to pursue other options and that is because the requirements under ESSA so we would like some feedback on that.

53:14.629 --> 53:36.179
You might recall that we had a business rule that we put in place where we assigned the performance level of orange for any district that did not certify their suspension data in CALPADS and for any district or school that did not test at least 50% of their English learners on the language test.

53:36.719 --> 53:39.440
They were automatically assigned a performance level of orange.

53:39.720 --> 53:43.462
We're considering changing that assignment to an automatic assignment of red.

53:43.922 --> 53:49.144
And we would like your specific feedback from you today on this particular item.

53:52.628 --> 53:59.055
So, with that, I'm happy to answer any questions.

54:01.157 --> 54:03.479
We are bringing these proposals to you.

54:04.240 --> 54:07.664
As I mentioned in the beginning, we're looking for guidance, especially on the last two that Jenny

54:08.024 --> 54:09.986
specifically mentioned, we are seeking guidance on.

54:10.266 --> 54:13.889
That does not mean that we're not open to having a conversation about the other pieces.

54:14.710 --> 54:21.656
We will, like anything that we do, make sure that it has technical merit by taking it to our technical design group.

54:22.056 --> 54:32.546
But we also, some of these ideas have come out actually through conferences we've attended with people from local educational agencies or parents or community members saying, why aren't you looking at this?

54:33.166 --> 54:38.509
And so that's how some of these ideas come to pass, I think, especially with that safety net recommendation.

54:38.529 --> 54:45.512
I think Jenny was at a conference last month in Monterey, and there was a lot of interest and some pressure to bring that forward.

54:45.893 --> 54:49.635
That's not to say that by the time it gets to you all, you may disagree.

54:50.675 --> 54:52.357
That is okay, too.

54:52.417 --> 55:00.144
This is definitely meant to be a transparent process, which is why we have laid out a work plan for these next several months.

55:00.865 --> 55:07.371
It will involve quite a bit of stakeholders, not only in our technical design group, but if we have a working group that we have established.

55:08.172 --> 55:15.416
English Learner Progress Workgroup, or our College Career Indicator Workgroup, or our Alternative Schools Task Force, you will hear what they have to say as well.

55:16.557 --> 55:27.543
We have an ongoing, every other month, discussion with the local control funding formula stakeholder group, which includes not only our education advocates, but our equity groups.

55:28.203 --> 55:30.304
So there is a thorough vetting of these.

55:31.264 --> 55:34.705
Sometimes I think the language we use makes it sound like it's a done deal, and it's not a done deal.

55:34.725 --> 55:46.310
You all have the final say in anything that we bring forward, and hopefully for inclusion in the fall dashboard, which will be a very robust dashboard with two extra indicators with colors on them.

55:46.370 --> 55:48.611
So there's a lot of work to do to get to that place.

55:49.751 --> 55:57.014
Yeah, I'd like to start with comments on the fifth year graduation rate and hear views of board members on that, Ortiz, Lacombe.

56:00.119 --> 56:01.655
Oh, OK, Nikki Sandoval.

56:07.483 --> 56:25.036
About the five-year graduation rate, I feel very strongly that there should be a way to incorporate that in the dashboard, especially, I think we all should think about our students with disabilities and schools that are working to keep our students in school.

56:25.436 --> 56:28.138
And sometimes it takes five years to earn a high school diploma.

56:29.099 --> 56:32.541
So I think that there needs to be a way to reflect that in the dashboard.

56:32.562 --> 56:35.664
Martiz Lacone.

56:37.924 --> 56:39.986
I'm on the fence and I'll tell you why.

56:40.026 --> 56:46.272
I think that it is great, it is ideal for us to graduate our students and some may need that five year, that fifth year.

56:46.813 --> 56:49.235
My concern has always been a tracking system.

56:50.616 --> 57:00.266
I read some of the letters and folks pointed to unaccompanied youth or LTELs, but we're not tracking information of students whether or not they're unaccompanied.

57:00.646 --> 57:03.328
So we don't know that that's actually who's benefiting from this.

57:03.468 --> 57:10.692
If they're LTELs, the majority of our English learners are born in the States and have started with us since kinder.

57:11.052 --> 57:14.874
So we really should just try to graduate them by that fourth year.

57:14.894 --> 57:22.279
And so my concern would be, one, if we included an essay, it has to show that it is more rigorous.

57:22.819 --> 57:31.371
So some examples have been when students take that fifth year to earn an AA while they're earning their high school degree because they're doing concurrent enrollment.

57:31.631 --> 57:33.814
So that would be an example of something that's more rigorous.

57:34.175 --> 57:37.880
So I would like to hear how we would justify it being more rigorous.

57:39.280 --> 57:58.806
versus just saying we want to give students extra time because I would hate to be that student that somebody determines that I need that fifth year when perhaps I don't right I just need to be better served so that would be my only concern is can this become a tracking system and if we want to pursue the fifth year how are we making this more rigorous

57:59.406 --> 58:02.727
or we have a sense of who are these students that are pursuing the fifth year.

58:03.368 --> 58:14.713
And again it can be intuitive because saying that it's unaccompanied youth we're assuming that it's unaccompanied youth and we wouldn't want to track that either because we don't want to jeopardize the well-being of our students and their status.

58:15.533 --> 58:15.773
Thanks.

58:16.473 --> 58:17.094
Other comments?

58:17.114 --> 58:17.894
Board Member Sun.

58:19.855 --> 58:25.137
So I would like to seek a fifth year graduation rate for a couple reasons.

58:25.817 --> 58:35.240
One is the students on IEPs who may need a little bit further time and we are seeing a huge increase in the number of students on IEPs and 504s.

58:36.360 --> 58:53.029
that do need that additional time and that pressure of having to finish or not graduate at all in the four years is something that I think actually puts them back when it comes to social-emotional stress, anxiety, all of those.

58:53.769 --> 58:56.651
The other is more of a technical question.

58:57.812 --> 59:00.073
Remember, I think I believe that we

59:00.653 --> 59:10.115
have moved back the timing of the graduation, like when a student is considered a graduate, right?

59:10.816 --> 59:18.297
From, I think it used to be in August, and now it is... Yes, August 15th was the date.

59:18.477 --> 59:19.958
Was the date, and now it is...

59:23.877 --> 59:33.603
So it is still August 15th, but with that I will say that we are moving up the timeline to submit data for the graduation rate.

59:33.703 --> 59:44.629
You may recall this board and a lot of stakeholder groups and districts wanted us to have up-to-date information in the dashboard and you may recall that the graduation rate was always a lag indicator.

59:45.149 --> 59:49.633
And so we were asked to see what we could do to move that up.

59:50.113 --> 59:55.337
And of course, to put in the most current data, we have to actually shorten the timeline for submittal.

59:55.798 --> 01:00:01.883
So even though the August 15th date will still be there, it might be more difficult for districts to report that data.

01:00:02.443 --> 01:00:14.193
Yes, because we do have students who, their senior year, go to summer school to finish that one class, one credit, and then they would not be considered graduates within the school's information.

01:00:14.373 --> 01:00:19.638
So the August 15th wouldn't pick that up because some of them are still in school.

01:00:20.453 --> 01:00:28.800
Yes, they're taking summer school or something, but the schools have to report the number of students who did not graduate before that time.

01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:30.061
Before that time.

01:00:30.281 --> 01:00:31.662
Actually, it's after that time.

01:00:31.702 --> 01:00:32.743
I think right now it's the 25th.

01:00:33.143 --> 01:00:35.285
Is that right?

01:00:35.305 --> 01:00:35.385
24th.

01:00:35.425 --> 01:00:40.629
24th of August is the final deadline for end-of-year submission, which this will be part of.

01:00:44.876 --> 01:00:49.200
Okay, so I'm going to support the direction of exploring the five year graduation.

01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:54.706
We understand your recommendation, at least on this proposal is we have a four year and we'll have a five year.

01:00:54.766 --> 01:01:00.591
And I would say, particularly for the kids who the students who do go to summer school to finish that last class or.

01:01:01.332 --> 01:01:04.294
May and June got kind of crazy at school and they didn't pass and they had to do it.

01:01:04.354 --> 01:01:07.996
But there are a few kids students who come back for fifth year seniors.

01:01:08.076 --> 01:01:09.857
It's not very often, but sometimes.

01:01:10.297 --> 01:01:12.018
And it's not only special needs kids.

01:01:12.098 --> 01:01:14.020
It depends on what else is going on in students lives.

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:15.060
So I'd like the option.

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.542
So I would support the reporting both.

01:01:18.462 --> 01:01:23.285
And I think that would just help ensure that those students try to get everyone graduated by four year.

01:01:23.305 --> 01:01:27.468
But if it takes a little more time that there's a recognition that we are getting them to graduate.

01:01:27.508 --> 01:01:29.829
So I would support the recommendation that we explore both.

01:01:32.674 --> 01:01:33.374
Board Member Burr.

01:01:34.334 --> 01:01:40.116
So I agree with the comments by Board Member Sung and Board Member Strauss about exploring it.

01:01:40.496 --> 01:01:53.839
The one thing I want to be clear about, and this is where I probably differ from my friend on my left, that I think we want to have the presentation as what it looks like in our system, not what ESSA wants.

01:01:54.179 --> 01:01:56.580
You know, there's a theme here about ESSA.

01:01:57.981 --> 01:02:02.263
So just so that we have those options available, what does it look like if it's just the state system?

01:02:02.303 --> 01:02:04.644
What does it look like if we're complying with ESSA?

01:02:05.324 --> 01:02:15.769
Because I do think there are many circumstances under which a fifth-year graduation rate would be not only motivating to students but also helpful to our LEAs in terms of their planning.

01:02:17.290 --> 01:02:19.731
Board member Valdez.

01:02:21.517 --> 01:02:23.878
I'm also in favor of a five-year looking into that.

01:02:24.018 --> 01:02:28.980
I have a couple questions though when we think about the rigor and I concur that the rigor needs to be there.

01:02:30.441 --> 01:02:35.903
I think it's a question of not if they'll graduate but when they graduate and there are students who need that fifth year.

01:02:35.963 --> 01:02:46.987
I'd like to know the number of students approximately and what are we talking about but I also think that this helps districts demonstrate their commitment to getting students a diploma, a high school diploma

01:02:47.507 --> 01:02:50.311
and sometimes it takes a longer period of time.

01:02:50.371 --> 01:02:51.332
So that's my thoughts.

01:02:56.944 --> 01:03:03.650
I have to admit I was also on the fence for a while and it was about the access and the equity issue.

01:03:04.751 --> 01:03:09.054
This can't be, but I am going to support the recommendation today.

01:03:09.574 --> 01:03:20.163
This cannot become, by salutary neglect, some way that districts use of tracking or monitoring students either based on their performance or based on their

01:03:20.663 --> 01:03:23.045
lag in completing graduation requirements.

01:03:23.105 --> 01:03:34.014
It cannot become a systemic way of placing, monitoring, or tracking students and meeting graduation requirements in order to meet or do this report.

01:03:34.354 --> 01:03:43.502
The fifth-year graduation should be an exception, not a rule, regardless of what the reason for the exception of needing the additional time is.

01:03:44.062 --> 01:03:58.859
And so if we begin seeing in this reporting an increase in the number of students that are being placed through or being reported in this fifth year graduation rate, we have a continuing issue of disparate impact

01:03:59.179 --> 01:04:10.226
that looks just like the significant disproportionate representation of students being referred to special ed or the significant disproportionate ways that students are being represented on the suspension rate.

01:04:10.547 --> 01:04:12.828
So what I do not want to see is that.

01:04:13.208 --> 01:04:20.333
And so it needs to be clear that this is a reporting activity, not an option for counseling, placing and tracking students.

01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:28.419
And so again, I want to emphasize the fifth year is an exception, not something that becomes a norm for what schools do.

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:33.557
And so I will support that for this reason, but I do have that concern.

01:04:34.482 --> 01:04:57.410
So I just want to remind everyone that under AYP we actually did produce a five-year grad rate so we have that data for those years and if I recall and I'm not saying that my memory is as good as it used to be but if I recall there wasn't an increase in five-year grad rates over time but we will look at that data because we have that and we can provide some information to you.

01:04:58.471 --> 01:04:59.371
Board Member Holiday.

01:04:59.642 --> 01:05:02.243
So the dashboard is supposed to provide us more information.

01:05:02.303 --> 01:05:05.505
And this is the fifth year cohort is information.

01:05:06.005 --> 01:05:18.271
And just because that information is published, I don't think that it necessarily means that schools and districts are going to somehow find comfort in their five year cohort.

01:05:19.031 --> 01:05:25.594
So I think it's important to shine a light on those and to let us know how many and where they are and who they are.

01:05:25.694 --> 01:05:27.895
So I am in favor of exploring that.

01:05:28.971 --> 01:05:31.417
Yeah, I've studied this a lot in higher education.

01:05:32.539 --> 01:05:37.952
And as you know, a four-year graduation rate was this norm for a long time.

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:43.082
Then we began to find that there was a whole lot of graduation in the fifth and sixth year.

01:05:43.143 --> 01:05:51.087
So higher education uses basically four years, six years, and for tracking purposes they go up to eight years.

01:05:51.167 --> 01:05:56.590
There's quite a significant... there's some who graduate, take as long as eight years.

01:05:57.370 --> 01:06:06.536
So the theme, I support this too, but the mixed record of this, part of the four-year lack of graduation is bad scheduling.

01:06:07.356 --> 01:06:09.998
by the post-secondary education institutions.

01:06:10.038 --> 01:06:13.361
They don't offer the right required classes at the right time.

01:06:13.881 --> 01:06:22.508
Whoever does their master schedules at a lot of these places are not looking at students, they're looking at what I understand we do in higher education.

01:06:22.909 --> 01:06:25.891
You schedule the classes when the professors want to teach.

01:06:26.071 --> 01:06:27.993
I always schedule 10 o'clock and

01:06:29.594 --> 01:06:38.138
And there was a glut of 10 o'clock, but if you wanted to have a go at 5 o'clock, you know, the students had a lot more flexibility there.

01:06:38.878 --> 01:06:48.183
So there's issues there, but I do think the other thing about higher education, and I've observed, is that there are

01:06:49.227 --> 01:06:58.193
whole lots of things going on in students and family life that impact the graduation rate that are outside the control of the school.

01:06:59.274 --> 01:07:06.979
They move around, there's family crises, they have to go to work temporarily, things of that sort.

01:07:07.059 --> 01:07:16.446
So I think it is proper to do this but we need to keep in mind that and we're at the mercy of these high school master schedules and I often

01:07:17.516 --> 01:07:22.660
wonder really we need to keep a sharp eye on that as we proceed with this.

01:07:25.002 --> 01:07:37.191
So perhaps we can move over to the second place we were looking for specific guidance on the automatic assignment of red performance levels and happy to respond to questions or again feedback on on this particular.

01:07:37.211 --> 01:07:37.812
Board Member Holland.

01:07:38.672 --> 01:07:42.696
So this is about the automatic assignment of the red performance level.

01:07:43.684 --> 01:07:51.866
So once again, I think the dashboard is a tool to provide information about what's going on in schools and districts.

01:07:52.546 --> 01:07:56.907
I don't think the purpose is to use the dashboard in a punitive way.

01:07:57.587 --> 01:08:04.229
And by turning this into a automatic red performance level, it is not giving accurate information.

01:08:04.829 --> 01:08:10.690
That school very likely may not be in the red performance level for absenteeism or whatever.

01:08:11.966 --> 01:08:17.028
Instead, my recommendation would be to make it a purple.

01:08:18.608 --> 01:08:26.951
Seriously, seriously, because it is by doing that, you would say, this is what this means.

01:08:27.211 --> 01:08:28.451
We didn't get the information.

01:08:29.892 --> 01:08:35.994
You know, it doesn't mean that they're necessarily a red or an orange or any other color, it means

01:08:36.897 --> 01:08:40.619
We don't know where they are because they didn't give us the, certify the information.

01:08:40.959 --> 01:08:42.500
And that's what this purple means.

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:45.021
So it still is a red.

01:08:46.781 --> 01:08:53.364
It still is a flag for parents and the community to say, well, something's wrong here.

01:08:53.745 --> 01:08:54.865
And it certainly can be noted.

01:08:55.205 --> 01:08:57.806
But to automatically assign it to red, I think, is a mistake.

01:09:00.728 --> 01:09:01.248
Who's next?

01:09:01.928 --> 01:09:03.409
Felisa Ortiz-Lacombe.

01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:08.463
Can I ask why we're making this recommendation?

01:09:08.483 --> 01:09:09.864
Has this been a pattern?

01:09:10.064 --> 01:09:16.450
Is this something that we're encountering with some of our LEAs not submitting information or not testing at least 50% of their ELs?

01:09:18.459 --> 01:09:24.401
So we did do an assignment of orange on the 2017 dashboard.

01:09:24.441 --> 01:09:27.441
It was less than a dozen schools.

01:09:28.542 --> 01:09:38.784
But we're doing this because if they're a red, we have some schools that could use some support in helping them with their system and how to report data.

01:09:39.304 --> 01:09:44.246
And so if they get a red, then they might actually be able to get some support for

01:09:45.606 --> 01:09:49.128
helping them better manage their data reporting systems.

01:09:49.609 --> 01:09:51.030
And that's why we were considering it.

01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:52.030
And how about on the LP?

01:09:52.811 --> 01:10:01.257
And on the LP, of course, districts are required to test their students for language in the language assessment.

01:10:01.877 --> 01:10:15.346
And we felt that if they weren't doing that, that they're that they should that we couldn't possibly give them a green if they've only tested, you know, 49 percent or percent of their students because it doesn't reflect all their students.

01:10:15.826 --> 01:10:22.351
And I would agree with at least 50% of English learners being tested, if not, you know, defaulting to a red.

01:10:22.471 --> 01:10:23.932
I don't agree in adding another color.

01:10:24.012 --> 01:10:27.935
I think that that would be very, very confusing to people.

01:10:28.035 --> 01:10:32.498
And we've already, we're kind of trending on our color scheme that we have.

01:10:32.638 --> 01:10:36.300
So I wouldn't want to add something else to the dashboard.

01:10:36.661 --> 01:10:42.585
But I do think that 50%, if you're not testing 50% of your English learners, that's bad.

01:10:43.305 --> 01:10:43.846
That's really bad.

01:10:46.595 --> 01:10:46.795
Sir.

01:10:49.419 --> 01:10:49.900
Who's next?

01:10:51.342 --> 01:10:52.164
Board Member Holiday.

01:10:53.987 --> 01:10:57.713
Yeah, I understand how adding another color can be a problem.

01:10:58.109 --> 01:11:04.912
And I understand how not testing 50% is a horrible problem and I understand how not certifying this.

01:11:05.272 --> 01:11:05.952
All this is bad.

01:11:06.493 --> 01:11:13.555
I think it's a slippery slope if you turn the dashboard from purely raw information into a punitive tool.

01:11:13.896 --> 01:11:16.397
I think that's not a good route to go.

01:11:18.618 --> 01:11:19.358
Board Member Rucker.

01:11:21.926 --> 01:11:28.251
Well, I do understand the issue about the color, but I'm also not in favor of adding another color.

01:11:28.852 --> 01:11:39.401
And as I'm sitting here listening to this conversation, I'm looking at Liz Guillen, because Public Advocates has been really strong in urging and advocating to the board

01:11:39.761 --> 01:11:52.409
when LEAs are failing to make timely reporting and information about the material and content that's required for accountability purposes and what should be placed in the school report card and what should be reported.

01:11:52.790 --> 01:12:00.455
So I think it is important to identify when schools are not making these reports in a timely manner.

01:12:00.935 --> 01:12:09.401
But I'm also sensitive to the fact that if we're truly trying to use the dashboard to focus on continuous improvement,

01:12:10.542 --> 01:12:20.717
using the dashboard to signal for a systemic failure of the schools to not have the personnel who are supposed to do the work they do.

01:12:21.943 --> 01:12:32.789
We already have those conversations in our waivers when we have discussions about waivers because someone forgot to test a group of students or someone forgot to turn in some report on time.

01:12:33.290 --> 01:12:39.033
I think that we do have other symbols in the dashboard that we can use.

01:12:39.093 --> 01:12:47.438
If the information's not there, there are symbols that we've already approved that can simply say that there's not a sufficient amount of information.

01:12:47.938 --> 01:13:01.283
to be able to give this report rather than punishing the school with a color change so that if the school did not turn in the information so it could be reported, there should be no color reported for that school.

01:13:01.323 --> 01:13:06.505
That's still a performance indicator because it means something didn't happen and something wasn't reported.

01:13:06.845 --> 01:13:08.046
I think it's the asterisk.

01:13:08.086 --> 01:13:09.807
I can't remember what the symbol is.

01:13:10.307 --> 01:13:15.729
So rather than doing a color change to punish some central office personnel who did not get

01:13:16.149 --> 01:13:18.751
the work done to do the reporting in a timely manner.

01:13:19.231 --> 01:13:25.296
I think it's more important to notify the public the data simply wasn't turned in by simply using that.

01:13:25.816 --> 01:13:32.141
Approve another symbol saying the data wasn't turned in by the LEA for this item rather than create another color

01:13:32.501 --> 01:13:34.664
or to use the colors to punish the district.

01:13:35.865 --> 01:13:49.101
But further, for those districts that do these things, I think the other side of what we have to look at is how districts then use this process of not reporting or continuously failing to report

01:13:49.501 --> 01:13:54.183
That's a separate issue from whether or not the reports are actually happening.

01:13:54.543 --> 01:14:11.810
And so I think some work does need to be done with that because as you know, we do have districts from year to year that regularly have problems, not only getting their data upload for their school report cards done on time, but getting other things relative to the accountability and the assessment system done on time.

01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:15.572
So that's a larger problem than accountability reporting.

01:14:22.424 --> 01:14:36.835
So I think it would be really important to discern if it's a will or a skill from the district level who are not participating and so I think you already said Jenny that there were only a few districts who changed colors to orange this year and

01:14:37.535 --> 01:14:38.435
And I think I concur.

01:14:38.556 --> 01:14:53.422
I mean, I I would recommend no color, but I would also recommend some kind of a trigger that as soon as the window closes and you have, let's say, 12 districts that that there's an outreach assuming good intentions of why they didn't to help them get.

01:14:53.882 --> 01:14:59.945
So so not just to use it as a gotcha and this is your color, but rather, how can we make this better?

01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:03.351
Thank you.

01:15:04.332 --> 01:15:09.658
Carrick Ashley, Deputy Superintendent, I did I did want to add one aspect to this conversation.

01:15:10.439 --> 01:15:20.952
Fortunately, this is a small number of districts we're talking about, but I I can attest that a couple of years ago prior to the dashboard release.

01:15:21.567 --> 01:15:40.600
There was a district, and I'm not going to name them publicly, but I'll be glad to talk privately with anyone who's interested, who purposefully did not certify their data because not having data was better for them than the negative publicity they would have gotten from the data that was accurate.

01:15:41.801 --> 01:15:51.208
So, just wanted to make, we don't want to provide an incentive for those not to certify their data because orange is better than red.

01:15:53.295 --> 01:15:56.919
And Karek also, I thought he was going to mention this.

01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:01.725
We have, my colleague was down here just a minute ago, but he's disappeared.

01:16:02.005 --> 01:16:09.173
Jerry Winkler, who's the manager or the division director of the, he didn't disappear, I'm sure he went upstairs, the Educational Data Management Division.

01:16:09.193 --> 01:16:10.214
I'm going to get in trouble for that one.

01:16:13.328 --> 01:16:24.332
He manages a contract with the Kern County Office of Education, CSES, the California School Information System, thank you, too many acronyms today.

01:16:24.952 --> 01:16:27.293
And they do exactly what you're talking about.

01:16:27.733 --> 01:16:31.534
They are, before any deadline, they have, you know,

01:16:32.094 --> 01:16:39.897
Actually, before we even open a data collection window, they have a proposed, this is how you should maybe structure your data input activities.

01:16:40.257 --> 01:16:42.138
By September, this is a milestone.

01:16:42.158 --> 01:16:44.079
By October, there's another milestone.

01:16:44.479 --> 01:16:47.780
And if by November and there's a deadline and they haven't met it, they're calling them.

01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:50.201
They're calling them every day kind of thing.

01:16:50.281 --> 01:16:56.964
So we have the benefit of that really fantastic outreach from our partners at Kern County Office of Education.

01:16:57.684 --> 01:17:07.673
And so, but that's not to say that we don't have people that have submitted either no data or inaccurate data and told us afterwards, oh, we messed up kind of thing.

01:17:07.693 --> 01:17:11.216
Senator Valdez.

01:17:11.556 --> 01:17:15.079
So just to one other comment, then there should be some other sanction.

01:17:15.119 --> 01:17:17.561
I mean, I'm saying a sanction, some kind of a monetary thing.

01:17:17.621 --> 01:17:20.443
Hold back some EL money if they're not testing their EL learners.

01:17:20.463 --> 01:17:23.145
I mean, those are the kind of things that I think should happen.

01:17:23.185 --> 01:17:24.607
I don't know how that wouldn't happen.

01:17:27.932 --> 01:17:29.475
Thank you for the feedback.

01:17:30.497 --> 01:17:32.440
Is there any other on this particular attachment?

01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:33.562
Are you ready to move on?

01:17:37.068 --> 01:17:39.072
We can definitely go ahead.

01:17:39.292 --> 01:17:39.473
Yes.

01:17:42.057 --> 01:17:48.963
So I had a question about the safety net because we're using the word student group.

01:17:50.324 --> 01:17:52.146
So are we saying subgroup?

01:17:53.467 --> 01:17:55.048
Because we have an end size right now of 30.

01:17:55.168 --> 01:18:07.198
So I'm wondering how this would look if we apply the safety net methodology to an end size of 30, which is very different than what we had previously with 120, I believe.

01:18:08.519 --> 01:18:10.023
So what are we proposing here?

01:18:10.043 --> 01:18:12.408
Because there wasn't a lot of information.

01:18:13.007 --> 01:18:22.393
So the current safety net is applied at the school level and if you have less than 150 students, we apply the three by five grid to make a determination.

01:18:22.813 --> 01:18:34.461
We are proposing to use that same methodology at the student group level or subgroups for all the subgroups that have between 30 and less than 150 students.

01:18:34.901 --> 01:18:41.565
So they would get the three by five applied to make a determination in the suspension rate and the graduation rate only.

01:18:42.947 --> 01:18:44.729
So it would be above 30, though?

01:18:45.670 --> 01:18:46.291
Yes.

01:18:46.892 --> 01:18:52.438
And are you recommending 30 and 120, or 30 and 150, or are you going to do some analysis around that?

01:18:52.458 --> 01:18:53.780
Between 30 and less than 150.

01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:54.100
Okay.

01:18:54.120 --> 01:19:00.248
And we are going to be doing analysis on that, so we will be bringing that information to you.

01:19:00.708 --> 01:19:00.969
Okay.

01:19:01.289 --> 01:19:06.451
And my second question was around the college or career.

01:19:07.652 --> 01:19:11.354
So the CCI, the memo really helped to clarify.

01:19:11.434 --> 01:19:12.914
I know I had some questions around that.

01:19:13.275 --> 01:19:16.216
So I have a technical question, then I have more of a philosophical question.

01:19:16.716 --> 01:19:20.098
The technical, how are we going, when do we add new measures?

01:19:20.478 --> 01:19:25.381
How are we then doing the change considering that we're adding additional measures?

01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:26.802
So that's the technical.

01:19:27.462 --> 01:19:31.444
And then I honestly have to say I missed when we dropped and.

01:19:32.105 --> 01:19:43.811
I thought we were college and career and I know that then it became CCI and I read some of the letters that came in and people think that is college and career but there was a memo that finally said or career.

01:19:45.072 --> 01:19:50.679
So are we saying or until we have a well-prepared that could make it a college and career?

01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:54.784
Or why do we eventually drop the and and become or?

01:19:55.045 --> 01:19:56.787
Because I really miss that.

01:19:58.208 --> 01:20:02.513
Well, we did drop the N, and we did it when we went from four levels to three levels.

01:20:02.773 --> 01:20:12.123
We felt there weren't enough career measures in the CCI to have a well-prepared category, and that would be the category where it would be college and career ready.

01:20:12.664 --> 01:20:18.590
So until we are able to add in additional information for career, we will not be having a level four.

01:20:20.712 --> 01:20:30.160
But once we get to level four, the goal is that by 2020, hopefully we can add in a level four and it will be college and career ready.

01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:31.581
But that is the goal.

01:20:31.601 --> 01:20:34.784
Okay, so we're waiting for well-prepared to become and again.

01:20:34.804 --> 01:20:35.224
Correct.

01:20:35.404 --> 01:20:40.889
And can you tell us a little bit about the change, how we're going to figure that out once we add new measures?

01:20:41.348 --> 01:20:43.570
So we will have to do some simulations.

01:20:44.371 --> 01:20:52.198
We have already discussed this with our technical design group, and they don't feel that it's going to be a big issue.

01:20:52.579 --> 01:20:58.744
They don't think it's going to be a technical issue that we should be concerned about, but of course, we won't know until we do the simulations for them.

01:20:59.085 --> 01:21:03.289
But at this point, we're confident that we could add in measures because we're comparing cohort to cohort.

01:21:06.831 --> 01:21:18.057
and when we add new measures in that is going to give a boost to LEAs that is that is true so but we will be doing the simulations and bringing that information forward to the for the board to review.

01:21:18.077 --> 01:21:20.258
Board Member Sun.

01:21:21.132 --> 01:21:23.494
I just have a comment on the CCI as well.

01:21:23.514 --> 01:21:44.811
I just hope that before we start adding additional measures onto the CCI that we also are looking at the validity and reliability of what we've got currently because now we have the data really look at that, which students are included in CCI, which are not, and I think we've looked at it a little bit more closely and

01:21:45.211 --> 01:21:48.335
There's some kind of scratching of heads and wrinkling of brows.

01:21:48.556 --> 01:21:51.059
Really, is that what it means?

01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:58.429
So I just would encourage before we add additional stuff to really look at the current measures that we have.

01:21:59.474 --> 01:22:03.236
We have put more work into the CCI than any of the other indicators.

01:22:03.276 --> 01:22:05.596
We've done some extensive simulations on that.

01:22:19.862 --> 01:22:29.970
And we've worked with David Connolly in a contract that we had to review various things that would be appropriate to put in the CCI.

01:22:30.730 --> 01:22:34.053
We've had a lot of vetting with our stakeholder group.

01:22:34.093 --> 01:22:38.316
So we have put a lot of work and done a lot of simulations already.

01:22:38.936 --> 01:22:47.643
But we will be putting forth a paper that will show you the process that we use and the criteria that we establish for adding things into the CCI.

01:22:48.483 --> 01:23:02.816
I think there's a wealth of information and it's sort of hard to discern at this point, which is why the memo and it being more tailored and the feedback that you gave us at the last meeting and other meetings was really helpful to get us to focus on those particular areas.

01:23:02.876 --> 01:23:09.562
I think we think that you remember everything from two years ago and unfortunately really none of us do.

01:23:09.602 --> 01:23:12.465
So we have to remind ourselves of the work that's been put in.

01:23:13.089 --> 01:23:15.090
Yeah, let me heads up for the board.

01:23:16.411 --> 01:23:22.634
Under ESSA, if we remove, if we go along with the plan that we negotiated with the U.S.

01:23:22.674 --> 01:23:27.536
Department, we're going to have to list the 11th grade assessment results separately.

01:23:28.497 --> 01:23:32.138
And that will have spillover effects into the CCI.

01:23:32.218 --> 01:23:35.220
So that they're not ready to discuss that yet.

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:36.300
We haven't approved it.

01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:38.962
They haven't analyzed it, but that's coming.

01:23:39.122 --> 01:23:41.403
So this is still a work in progress.

01:23:45.383 --> 01:23:46.004
Member Valdez.

01:23:46.484 --> 01:23:48.705
So I think I missed the memo on the or and the and.

01:23:48.725 --> 01:23:51.107
It was before your time.

01:23:51.227 --> 01:23:54.449
Okay, thank you.

01:23:54.509 --> 01:24:13.282
So it's really worrying me because we just spent two days in our district talking about college and career and so we're going forward with all of the services and the programs and the support to be sure that we have this continuum of options for students and it just worries me that the indicator is an or

01:24:13.982 --> 01:24:17.344
I mean an or, yes, and that we are an and.

01:24:17.524 --> 01:24:26.970
And I think most of our consumers, our districts, have really embraced, and it has been an ongoing conversation for the last few years about and or or, right?

01:24:27.230 --> 01:24:29.631
And was it politically correct to say or or and?

01:24:30.032 --> 01:24:32.333
And so with that, I'm just really concerned.

01:24:32.433 --> 01:24:38.957
I would love to keep the and, even though I know it's a little bit of semantics, but it's a mindset over time.

01:24:39.197 --> 01:24:42.059
And so I just feel like it's gonna cause confusion.

01:24:44.246 --> 01:24:53.348
And the way that it's set up, it doesn't preclude somebody from being and, and that is definitely not the intent, and I hope that that wasn't taken that way.

01:24:53.868 --> 01:24:59.349
It's that we are working towards making sure that we can get there with the well-prepared piece.

01:24:59.389 --> 01:25:10.932
But there are several, and you'll see in the data, if you've got a chance to look at some of the reports, that they are both, a lot of our students that are prepared are actually prepared for both college and career.

01:25:11.801 --> 01:25:23.792
And I agree with you, it's just dropping it and changing it, it causes confusion and then sometimes it causes lack of trust and conversations happen and then it becomes confusing.

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:24.272
Thank you.

01:25:24.292 --> 01:25:27.415
Board Member Byrd.

01:25:29.052 --> 01:25:44.839
So on the CCI for just a second, first I do want to acknowledge the memo that was posted for February, which I thought was very helpful in helping refresh everybody's memory about what's in there, what's not, what we have moving forward.

01:25:45.359 --> 01:25:57.644
And I think the one thing that I think gets lost a little bit in conversations that I've had is that the CCI indicator is an indicator relative to LEAs, not relative to students.

01:25:58.544 --> 01:26:15.407
So while the student preparation, in my view, is the responsibility of the LEAs, and it's all kinds of different things, some of which that are in the CCI, some of which are not yet in the CCI, the way I look at the CCI for the state is it's like a good housekeeping seal.

01:26:16.088 --> 01:26:32.019
that if I look at my data dashboard and my school, my LEA is green, then I know, well, they've got a robust program at the high school level that is reflective of both career and college opportunities for students.

01:26:32.499 --> 01:26:38.644
So I think it's hard to kind of sort it out, and the reason, as Jenny and I were talking about,

01:26:39.644 --> 01:26:50.707
Cindy have mentioned is that we're not ready for well-prepared at the state level because of our sort of rigor with respect to what's in the CCI.

01:26:50.827 --> 01:27:02.851
So I just hope it's not sending confusing messages because at an LEA level, LEAs have expectations for their students and set their programming based on those expectations.

01:27:03.711 --> 01:27:06.472
And we're not suggesting that that should change in any way.

01:27:06.812 --> 01:27:18.135
What we're saying is we're growing into the CCI to get to the well-prepared level, which can be the end, ultimately, if we can meet our standard of rigor.

01:27:18.155 --> 01:27:22.816
Okay, who's next?

01:27:24.697 --> 01:27:25.457
Board Member Rocker.

01:27:26.462 --> 01:27:41.826
Well, let me begin by saying I well remember the action the board took and the day that the name of the indicator changed from the and and the or, because I voice strong opposition and concern about what that would mean.

01:27:41.906 --> 01:27:47.168
And I remember I used words that probably shocked my board president, like lip service.

01:27:47.788 --> 01:28:17.142
to career preparation and board member burr is correct this is not an indicator that's concerning that operates at the student level this is reporting about the access and the types of programs that are available and being provided by the district it's an assessment of the district's performance in creating access and balance in the programs they're providing to students and having said that my

01:28:17.722 --> 01:28:39.597
Concern remains that when we look at the individual elements that currently define the indicator, yes, the indicator does not have a balance of information that tells us about the scope and the type and variety and diversity of career preparation programs.

01:28:40.057 --> 01:28:40.978
that are available.

01:28:41.599 --> 01:28:55.212
But what and so and I also for that reason appreciate the February memo that was sent out to remind us about the work that has been done up to this point and the work that is in front of the department and the board

01:28:55.672 --> 01:28:58.654
to fully build out and develop the indicator.

01:28:59.175 --> 01:29:05.099
But let me say the same thing that I have said before and have been very consistent with.

01:29:05.719 --> 01:29:13.765
We may be very busy doing a lot of things, but are we doing the correct things?

01:29:14.710 --> 01:29:29.618
In the February Remember What Talk, one of the things that was discussed or at least touched upon, but not in the depth that it needed to be, was how we define career preparation and how we collect the data from districts about this, about what they're offering.

01:29:29.978 --> 01:29:40.104
Because we know that there's a great deal of flexibility in what's reported in CALPADS and how courses are identified, it's very difficult to quantify and to categorize

01:29:40.684 --> 01:29:43.287
all the different types of CTE.

01:29:43.327 --> 01:29:54.617
I have personally been concerned that right now, the only type of CTE that is being reported or fully reflected in the indicator are the programs funded through the Career Pathways Trust.

01:29:59.602 --> 01:30:00.223
I will.

01:30:00.624 --> 01:30:14.663
I appreciate all the work that you have reported that we have been doing with Dr. Conway and all of these other folks in the workgroup, but the fact is there is a lot of work that needs to be done to straighten out the data gathering and the collection

01:30:15.023 --> 01:30:20.487
and I don't think that that is fully explained or fully being vetted as well as it should be.

01:30:20.688 --> 01:30:22.509
I do remember when the change occurred.

01:30:22.849 --> 01:30:24.931
I strongly objected for those reasons.

01:30:25.291 --> 01:30:29.855
I know the Department is addressing that, but that is where the work and the priority needs to be.

01:30:37.974 --> 01:30:47.922
We have some members who want to and staff who want to do things concerning the student demonstration.

01:30:48.002 --> 01:30:49.363
So we will resume at 1020.

01:30:49.463 --> 01:30:50.243
Thank you.

01:30:54.887 --> 01:30:57.569
Okay, the State Board will reconvene.

01:30:59.290 --> 01:31:05.075
And if we can come back up, I think we're almost done with the questioning on that section.

01:31:06.983 --> 01:31:13.827
So do you want to move on, Cindy, to the next item there?

01:31:14.687 --> 01:31:17.508
Your next, it's a multi-item, here we go.

01:31:17.869 --> 01:31:18.289
Go ahead.

01:31:18.809 --> 01:31:27.033
We can, so seeing no other comments on attachment one, we'll move on to attachment two, which is going to be presented by Deputy, Chief Deputy Superintendent Glenn Price.

01:31:31.372 --> 01:31:53.564
President Kuerz, members of the board it's a delight to be with you presenting on the proposed revision for the self-reflection tool for priority six and especially I think appropriate that we're taking up this item just after or walk out in our comments earlier from Superintendent Tarlekson and Board Member Gray around the importance of school safety and the need to

01:31:54.284 --> 01:31:55.705
take further action in that regard.

01:31:57.167 --> 01:32:11.640
As we dive into this item, I really want to thank all of the stakeholders that have contributed to our work on school conditions and climate, and particularly want to thank a couple of my colleagues here at the Department of Education, Jacqueline Oleson,

01:32:12.801 --> 01:32:26.031
in my office and Jen Taylor in our expanded learning division who have really left it on the field in terms of getting ready for all of this work and helping stakeholders engage in this critical item.

01:32:28.413 --> 01:32:40.467
As we move along today, I wanted to just recall our presentation of the School Conditions and Climate Workgroup back in November of 2017 to the State Board of Education.

01:32:40.967 --> 01:32:48.676
And at that time, the workgroup presented three buckets of action that they were recommending in the area of school conditions and climate.

01:32:49.477 --> 01:33:03.192
And the first was required legislative action and additional financial investments and that work is moving forward and I would especially refer you to AB 2820 where there's some significant discussion occurring in the legislature about these issues.

01:33:04.113 --> 01:33:12.218
Bucket number two, work and actions that can be taken by the State Board of Education as part of your process of the dashboard's continuous improvement.

01:33:12.558 --> 01:33:14.439
And that's what we're going to be focusing on today.

01:33:14.979 --> 01:33:26.926
And then number three, areas where CDE and other participants in California's statewide system of support can be taking action immediately with tools and resources at our disposal.

01:33:28.347 --> 01:33:39.063
So just to recap again, for today, we're going to be focusing on that bucket number two, and specifically a proposed revision to the self-reflection tool for priority six.

01:33:39.887 --> 01:33:46.049
And this is contained that it's in your item, but also in a handout that you have in front of you.

01:33:46.149 --> 01:33:47.469
And we're coming back to this.

01:33:48.109 --> 01:33:59.833
And the superintendent and the California Department of Education are asking today that you take action to approve this revision to the self-reflection tool for priority six.

01:34:00.393 --> 01:34:23.063
And of course, this work builds on the complete set of recommendations that was made by the School Conditions and Climate Work Group and that great group of stakeholders that we got together for that work of parents, teachers, administrators, researchers coming together to make those recommendations, which you also have in front of you, and the memo that we presented to you in February of this year.

01:34:24.524 --> 01:34:42.959
This work builds on the continuous improvement framework that was put forward by the school conditions and climate work group, which you'll see reflected in the self-reflection tool that starts out with data, thinking about what is the data that we have in front of us.

01:34:43.979 --> 01:34:59.191
What is the meaning that we can make of that data and how should we actually then use it to drive forward the kinds of actions that will make our schools and school communities have positive climates and reflect the kinds of safety that we'd like to see.

01:34:59.731 --> 01:35:06.095
for our students and educators and their connectedness to those schools and educational institutions.

01:35:07.336 --> 01:35:17.882
So just as we get started on this work, I wanted to just reflect and connect back to the improved performance standard for local

01:35:18.662 --> 01:35:20.963
And we've got those up on the screen.

01:35:22.444 --> 01:35:42.091
And the board has asked LEAs to meet the approved standard of measuring their progress using locally available information, reporting that to their local governing boards at regularly scheduled public meetings, updating that progress through the dashboard, and then assessing their performance on a met, not met, not met for two or more years scale.

01:35:43.371 --> 01:36:06.222
The approved standard for priority six, and this is what we have in place right now, is that the LEA administer a local climate survey at least every other year that provides a valid measure of perceptions of school safety and connectedness, such as the California Healthy Kids Survey, and then report that information out at a regularly scheduled meeting of the local board and through the dashboard.

01:36:08.884 --> 01:36:25.936
The current self-reflection tool is also up there on the screen, and the self-reflection tool calls for LEAs to provide a narrative summary around the administration of that local climate survey, and report on that through a text box provided in the dashboard.

01:36:27.277 --> 01:36:34.202
And in the dashboard, LEAs have the opportunity to report out on their overall scores, such as through surveys like California Healthy Kids,

01:36:34.882 --> 01:36:41.986
and also to analyze any specific items related to school safety and connectedness.

01:36:43.166 --> 01:36:51.711
So at Your Direction, we gathered together a group of stakeholders and worked for about a year on a set of very comprehensive recommendations, again, which you have in front of you.

01:36:52.611 --> 01:36:59.955
And we presented back in November of 2017 a proposed revision to the self-reflection tool.

01:37:00.435 --> 01:37:09.800
And at that time, you all asked us to engage in some additional stakeholder work around the self-reflection tool.

01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:11.781
We did that in a number of ways.

01:37:12.661 --> 01:37:26.576
I just really want to thank the California Practitioners Advisory Group for several in-depth discussions on the new self-reflection tool, and I'll be reporting out on their feedback around the tool in just a second.

01:37:27.877 --> 01:37:38.683
We also facilitated a great conversation with the LCFF stakeholder group in February and want to also thank representatives of small and rural schools who we met with also in February of this year.

01:37:39.183 --> 01:37:49.508
And then to complement that, we provided opportunity for the public to comment on the self-reflection tool through a survey conducted also in February of this year.

01:37:50.589 --> 01:38:00.638
So as part of that work, we asked, for example, CPAC and through the online survey, CPAC and members of the public, several questions about the self-reflection tool.

01:38:01.258 --> 01:38:08.865
We asked them whether the self-reflection tool assists school districts to better communicate what is occurring around school climate within their district.

01:38:08.885 --> 01:38:15.471
And you'll see there that 85% of CPAC members either agreed or strongly agreed that it did.

01:38:16.891 --> 01:38:30.236
We also asked CPAG members whether the tool helped parents, families, and community members better understand the climate of schools and their districts, and 100% either agreed or strongly agreed with that statement.

01:38:31.577 --> 01:38:42.281
CPAG members were also asked whether the tool helped to communicate decisions made and actions taken, and the vast majority either strongly agreed or agreed with that statement.

01:38:43.582 --> 01:39:03.362
Those types of results and that range of responses was also reflected through the online survey where 68% of respondents agreed that it assists with better communication, 61% it helps district stakeholders to better understand the climate, and 67% helps districts communicate actions to improve school climate.

01:39:04.523 --> 01:39:16.410
A vast and relatively large-scale agreement with the self-reflection tool being proposed, being an improvement to our current system.

01:39:17.731 --> 01:39:25.175
Some additional feedback that we heard, and this is just a sampling, and we've been able to incorporate this into the tool.

01:39:26.756 --> 01:39:30.118
To add the words data meaning and use to the appropriate guiding question,

01:39:30.918 --> 01:39:36.666
And I just wanted to share with you a quote from

01:39:38.772 --> 01:39:49.140
Superintendent Kaminsky from Azusa Unified who noted that these questions and those words speak to how LEAs reflect their key learnings on access and result.

01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:53.263
It speaks to disaggregated data, which is helpful for us to see what is occurring.

01:39:53.763 --> 01:40:00.589
And then the third helps us look at our next step, helps us deepen what we are doing, expand our change course, as they were discussing.

01:40:01.389 --> 01:40:02.909
use of those guiding questions.

01:40:04.490 --> 01:40:14.511
The small and rural districts were particularly happy that we added the language, asked to add the language and were happy that we did around additional data tools.

01:40:14.972 --> 01:40:27.914
And that language specifically encourages those districts who have other tools or other surveys or other forms of data gathering that they've used around school conditions and climate to add it into the self-reflection tool.

01:40:29.321 --> 01:40:31.022
So what are we proposing?

01:40:31.782 --> 01:40:42.127
Pulling up your blue sheet here, we've updated the language for priority six, the self-reflection tool.

01:40:42.147 --> 01:40:50.591
So this is the language that would be in the dashboard that LEAs would be responding to, as shown on the screen there.

01:40:50.611 --> 01:40:55.694
And that's the first paragraph that's at the top of your blue sheet.

01:40:56.697 --> 01:41:03.244
That local education agencies will provide a narrative summary of their local administration analysis of a local climate survey.

01:41:04.566 --> 01:41:16.078
And then as we go forward, that we would include an analysis of specific items on a local survey and additional data collection tools that are particularly relevant to school conditions and climate.

01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:18.421
We then have

01:41:19.234 --> 01:41:29.424
added some footnotes at the bottom where we've linked into the Ed Code language around sense of safety and school connectedness as the constructs that we're looking at.

01:41:29.884 --> 01:41:43.497
And then also a best practice around disaggregating where possible and if applicable to student groups in order to be able to look at student groups as we're looking at the results of these surveys and data collection tools.

01:41:44.744 --> 01:41:55.970
Then as you go further down the page on the blue sheet, we've added this language where the following are suggested guiding questions to help frame the narrative summary.

01:41:56.811 --> 01:42:12.200
Data, reflect on the key learnings from the survey results and share what the LEA learned, meaning what do the disaggregated results of the survey and other data collection methods reveal about schools in the LEA, such as areas of growth,

01:42:13.075 --> 01:42:16.117
areas of strength or growth, challenges and barriers, and then use.

01:42:16.817 --> 01:42:19.918
How are we using this data, these learnings to improve?

01:42:19.958 --> 01:42:27.642
What revisions, decisions or actions has or will the LEA implement in response to the results for continuous improvement purposes?

01:42:30.385 --> 01:42:35.368
So those are the changes that we're recommending to the self-reflection tool.

01:42:35.728 --> 01:42:49.556
Again, staff are recommending that the State Board of Education approved this proposed revision and that we begin incorporating it into the dashboard and utilize it going forward for priority six school climate.

01:42:50.556 --> 01:42:50.957
Thank you.

01:42:51.537 --> 01:42:53.698
Board member comments or questions on this?

01:42:56.580 --> 01:42:57.180
All right.

01:42:57.340 --> 01:42:58.441
State Superintendent.

01:42:59.582 --> 01:43:04.345
Glenn to share the names of those, and if any are here to have them be recognized who helped.

01:43:04.405 --> 01:43:08.467
It was quite a team effort and a lot of intensive work and creative thinking.

01:43:09.128 --> 01:43:12.650
And I commend Glenn, of course, but he had a whole team with him.

01:43:15.035 --> 01:43:35.696
Actually, if you look into your School Conditions and Climate Recommendation Framework, right at the top of the page there, the members of the School Conditions and Climate Work Group included Ken Barrick, Aaron Brengard, Shannon Brown, Shannon Cook-Harvey, Brent Ducour, Sherry Griffith, Tom Hanson, Tom Herman,

01:43:36.138 --> 01:43:39.041
Heather Huff, Taryn Ishida, Hannah Melnick, and Norma Sanchez.

01:43:39.801 --> 01:43:51.571
And then I just want to repeat the tremendous amount of stakeholder engagement work that was undertaken with literally hundreds of people contributing through open meetings, through the survey, and in other ways.

01:43:51.591 --> 01:44:00.059
Okay, if we have no comments on that, Board Member Ortiz-Lacon.

01:44:02.243 --> 01:44:05.365
Thank you for the presentation, and I want to thank everyone who was involved in this.

01:44:06.165 --> 01:44:16.911
I do think this is a huge improvement from the MET, not MED, because it allows us to really look and see how LEAs are reflecting on their data.

01:44:17.091 --> 01:44:18.912
I love the data meaning use.

01:44:19.352 --> 01:44:29.620
And in fact, I think we should do that with all of our local indicators so that we could see how the data is actually being reflected upon and applied, right?

01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:35.264
Is this going to have links or is that an option to link to the actual survey?

01:44:35.744 --> 01:44:39.487
And I know that folks would really wanna see this as an annual survey.

01:44:39.507 --> 01:44:45.892
I think that seems like that is not something that we can move forward, it's optional.

01:44:46.632 --> 01:44:51.315
But I think that it's important for us to have that data and then apply it, right?

01:44:51.375 --> 01:44:54.057
So, you know, you reflect on it, then you apply it.

01:44:54.397 --> 01:45:02.903
I do think it's limited for us just to have that data for students, because I know that teachers want their voices heard in this process.

01:45:03.023 --> 01:45:06.325
Parents absolutely want their voice heard in this process.

01:45:06.406 --> 01:45:12.349
And that is a good way to triangulate the data and see, does this school climate meet the needs of our community?

01:45:12.389 --> 01:45:16.052
And the community goes beyond the student, although it should be focused on the student.

01:45:16.773 --> 01:45:23.058
So I do think that this is a great way to reflect upon it and I would like to see this actually with the other local indicators as well.

01:45:25.219 --> 01:45:39.451
And just in response to that the one piece around linking the dashboard will encourage LEAs if they have a link available to include that in the dashboard and then in addition to break that down by student group if available and applicable.

01:45:41.308 --> 01:45:43.009
Okay, nothing more.

01:45:43.129 --> 01:45:47.970
We can then we have one more item, sub-item in this item.

01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:59.814
Good morning President Kerr, Superintendent Torlakson, members of the board.

01:45:59.834 --> 01:46:02.835
I'm Jeff Breshears, the Director of the Local Agency Assistance Support Office.

01:46:03.607 --> 01:46:10.193
And I'm here to talk about the request and the recommendation for local indicator for Priority 7.

01:46:10.253 --> 01:46:24.165
We're recommending that the State Board approve the standard consistent with the standards adopted for the other local indicators and the proposed self-assessment tool to determine progress for the local performance indicator for Priority 7 access to a broad course of study.

01:46:25.325 --> 01:46:31.029
It's attachment three is the draft self-reflection tool.

01:46:31.629 --> 01:46:40.955
It is reflective of feedback from you when I was before you in November and also from the CPAC group and the LCFF stakeholder groups.

01:46:41.456 --> 01:46:50.421
Some of the major changes that were made to the self-reflection tool is one is that we listed the courses that are supposed to be offered grades one through six and also seven through 12.

01:46:51.542 --> 01:47:00.153
and then on one of the prompts, we changed the third and fourth prompt, which I will get to as well, but the first prompt was talking about just taking from statute.

01:47:00.194 --> 01:47:06.161
We took also a lot of the statute that gets in the way of reading, but also to talk about

01:47:07.483 --> 01:47:26.546
the access to a broad course of study of students who have that access and enrolled in for unduplicated pupils under LCFF, but also there's an encouragement that LEAs are not restricted to just the unduplicated pupil groups, to look at all of their students within the LEA to determine them.

01:47:27.047 --> 01:47:34.588
And then also the prompts that were changed was the third and the fourth prompt, and one is the third prompt was to identify barriers

01:47:36.809 --> 01:47:42.875
Given the results, identify the barriers preventing the LEA from providing an access to a broad course of study for all students.

01:47:43.335 --> 01:47:54.464
And then the last prompt is, then given that information, what action have you take or will you take then to overcome those barriers and to offer that access to a broad course of study?

01:47:56.506 --> 01:47:57.887
And I'm happy to answer any questions.

01:47:59.389 --> 01:47:59.769
Questions?

01:48:01.331 --> 01:48:05.033
Okay, I think we're ready for public comment now on this item.

01:48:05.413 --> 01:48:05.653
No?

01:48:06.633 --> 01:48:07.274
One more item?

01:48:11.275 --> 01:48:13.096
This is maybe the fun part.

01:48:14.977 --> 01:48:15.297
Sorry.

01:48:16.218 --> 01:48:19.279
I'm sure Glenn's piece was fun, but we are going to have some fun today.

01:48:19.819 --> 01:48:21.020
So we wanted to

01:48:24.082 --> 01:48:24.542
Never mind.

01:48:26.643 --> 01:48:27.744
My window's been closed.

01:48:28.364 --> 01:48:30.886
I'm not going to take the time to do that.

01:48:30.906 --> 01:48:33.407
But I do wanted to talk about this mock-up here.

01:48:33.907 --> 01:48:39.991
So one of the things that we've gotten feedback on is really that landing page and how reports look and feel.

01:48:40.031 --> 01:48:42.272
And there's a lot of white space and a lot of text heavy.

01:48:42.652 --> 01:48:45.293
So we wanted to jazz it up.

01:48:45.373 --> 01:48:49.596
This is one mock-up that our contractor has put together for us.

01:48:50.696 --> 01:48:55.438
and thinking about doing it in like a rotating carousel, sort of like you see on our department's webpage.

01:48:56.258 --> 01:48:57.979
So I wanted to show you this.

01:48:57.999 --> 01:49:07.422
There's actually, if I had had the site up, which it was this morning, you could see that we put together really a mission statement.

01:49:07.442 --> 01:49:08.342
That was one thing that they said.

01:49:09.082 --> 01:49:12.283
You don't clearly articulate really what people should get out of this.

01:49:12.644 --> 01:49:19.746
So this is the beginning of, I think, a process until we get to our new dashboard release in the fall.

01:49:20.286 --> 01:49:25.409
to change the look and feel to make it a little more visually pleasing.

01:49:25.509 --> 01:49:29.512
I know the Governor's budget proposes an additional $300,000 towards this.

01:49:30.392 --> 01:49:42.059
While this is only the homepage, the look and feel of some of the concerns you've raised in the past about equity report and others, trying to make that a little bit more manageable are things we are looking into.

01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:53.409
The other thing we have directly asked the contractor to look into and to further as we think about redesigning this is to make it a translatable website into Spanish.

01:49:53.429 --> 01:50:02.377
That is still on the list of things to do, but we want to make sure that they're not doing it now when we know we have a redesign.

01:50:03.198 --> 01:50:05.380
it planned in the next several months.

01:50:06.301 --> 01:50:10.445
And then the final piece is that we do have now the functionality to print to PDF.

01:50:10.525 --> 01:50:18.734
So if you wanted to print a single report or if you wanted to print the entire school or district, that functionality is now in place.

01:50:18.834 --> 01:50:24.159
And so with that I just wanted to point out one extra piece and actually give some

01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:27.481
some kudos to Veronica and her staff.

01:50:27.541 --> 01:50:34.422
They're hosting a migrant parent conference this weekend in San Francisco, and they invited us to do a presentation on the dashboard.

01:50:35.182 --> 01:50:49.746
And unfortunately, none of my staff are certified bilingual, but one of her staff is actually going to do the presentation for us, and Jenny Singh will be there to help respond to any questions in which they'll obviously be translated back into Spanish.

01:50:51.446 --> 01:50:55.714
One that we've not gone to in the past and we're pretty excited about.

01:50:55.794 --> 01:50:58.518
So with that, we are done with the presentation.

01:50:58.558 --> 01:50:59.179
Thank you very much.

01:51:02.166 --> 01:51:08.151
So, Cindy, I know that the governor's budget that you commented on is going to do some stakeholder input and update the dashboard.

01:51:08.512 --> 01:51:23.044
So my hope is, and I guess I'm interested in the timeline, is the plan to have a bunch of stakeholder group input and then the contractor work and that when the release comes in the fall, it'll come to us for recommended edits and then it'll go out?

01:51:23.064 --> 01:51:23.765
Is that the plan?

01:51:23.805 --> 01:51:25.667
I don't think we've quite figured out the process.

01:51:25.747 --> 01:51:27.929
It's proposed for next fiscal year.

01:51:27.989 --> 01:51:28.789
So that is the

01:51:30.610 --> 01:51:39.133
What can we do in the current contract to keep this moving along so that by the December release we have a site that has been rebuilt?

01:51:40.294 --> 01:51:42.374
We will leverage Paul Richmond's group.

01:51:42.414 --> 01:51:53.798
We will leverage the other efforts that are already taking place and start getting this mockup out to begin the conversation.

01:51:53.959 --> 01:51:57.400
Our intent would be to get something out with this coming dashboard in 2018.

01:52:01.007 --> 01:52:03.548
All right, clerk will call the roll on public comment.

01:52:07.329 --> 01:52:09.210
Would the following people please line up.

01:52:09.230 --> 01:52:29.417
Doug McRae, Terry Burns, Martha Alvarez, Alfonso Gattagarza, Christy Sinclair, Carrie Roda, DeRay Totten, Sarah Monte, Sheila Whitley, Liz Guillen, Danny Espinosa, Brian Rivas, Elizabeth Robitaille, and Jessica Sacco.

01:52:29.677 --> 01:52:29.977
Thank you.

01:52:33.292 --> 01:52:33.733
Good morning.

01:52:33.753 --> 01:52:37.278
I'm Doug McRae, retired management specialist from Monterey.

01:52:38.179 --> 01:52:41.744
I've got two general comments on the evolution of the California dashboard.

01:52:42.665 --> 01:52:47.792
First, much of the data contributing to state indicators are either substandard or works in progress.

01:52:48.883 --> 01:52:54.887
particularly the academic indicator change data that due to the Smarter Balanced 2017 gain score problem.

01:52:55.067 --> 01:52:58.650
I'll have more to say about this problem when you hear the CASP item tomorrow morning.

01:53:00.191 --> 01:53:05.334
Secondly, the desire to continually improve each indicator messes with the truism.

01:53:06.375 --> 01:53:07.355
Those are technical terms.

01:53:08.596 --> 01:53:12.499
The truism that if you want to measure change, then don't change the measure.

01:53:13.359 --> 01:53:18.463
California needs to attend to mechanisms that address the problem of changing indicators from year to year.

01:53:19.084 --> 01:53:20.726
for the change portion of the dashboard.

01:53:21.327 --> 01:53:31.941
For more detail on the agenda materials, more than two pages of observations on nitty gritty detail for plan changes were included in the comments I submitted to your electronic folder late last week.

01:53:32.642 --> 01:53:32.943
Thank you.

01:53:37.813 --> 01:53:41.176
Good morning, Terry Burns, on behalf of the California School Boards Association.

01:53:41.836 --> 01:53:46.259
Regards to the five-year graduation rate, we completely concur with President Kirst.

01:53:46.860 --> 01:53:53.645
A lot of things happen in kids' lives and we think it's very important that you acknowledge the five-year graduation rate.

01:53:54.185 --> 01:54:03.247
that we show that districts are trying to serve those students and that we put diplomas in their hands to make them economically viable.

01:54:04.107 --> 01:54:15.149
As regards to adding a red indicator if districts have not submitted data, we concur with the comments stated by Member Holiday and Member Valdez.

01:54:15.809 --> 01:54:18.829
We don't think that the dashboard should be the penalty place.

01:54:19.289 --> 01:54:22.090
Have that conversation with that handful of districts.

01:54:22.982 --> 01:54:35.430
set up other penalties, have an indicator that says insufficient data reported or collected, whatever the case may be, but don't give them a random red indicator for that.

01:54:36.611 --> 01:54:51.521
And finally, as regards to priority six, we're really pleased to see the inclusion of the statutory language on every other year for the surveys that that recognizes both district resources and capacity.

01:54:51.761 --> 01:54:52.081
Thank you.

01:54:57.617 --> 01:55:03.904
Good morning, Martha Zeregoza-Diaz representing the California Association for Bilingual Education and Californians Together.

01:55:04.405 --> 01:55:16.178
First, I'd like to say that we appreciate what is stated in Attachment 3 regarding the data, especially under differentiated assurance, the review of data, and analysis of underlying causes.

01:55:16.818 --> 01:55:21.860
which all LEAs should take into consideration when doing their updated LCAPs.

01:55:22.501 --> 01:55:35.707
Also, we would like to make sure that the individuals who are going to provide the technical assistance and support, differentiated support, have the expertise and knowledge with regards to services and programs for unduplicated students.

01:55:36.367 --> 01:55:48.672
and especially with regards to English learners that they have knowledge of the EL roadmap that was recently approved by the State Board and what are the elements of high quality programs and services.

01:55:49.232 --> 01:55:57.116
This is important in order to make sure that the technical assistance and support is appropriate, especially for our English learner students.

01:55:57.396 --> 01:55:57.656
Thank you.

01:56:02.779 --> 01:56:06.662
Good morning, Elizabeth Robitaille on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association.

01:56:07.143 --> 01:56:16.931
We respectfully request that the State Board direct the Department to explore other options for including a five-year grad rate in the dashboard, and we appreciate the comments that you've made this morning about that already.

01:56:17.591 --> 01:56:25.638
We ask the State to direct staff to compare the State's tested options to the growth model that the core districts have now refined over a period of multiple years

01:56:26.278 --> 01:56:32.823
Also, we ask that modeling be provided to show the impact of various growth model options on charter schools and small school districts.

01:56:33.623 --> 01:56:38.827
We feel that the shift from an automatic assignment of orange to red is overly drastic and unwarranted.

01:56:39.867 --> 01:56:55.718
Not only does it send misinformation that may not reflect the performance of the school, but it feels premature to make this decision when we have not seen the modeling for how this would impact charters and small school districts and whether a safe harbor methodology would be applied in these circumstances.

01:56:56.598 --> 01:57:03.324
And finally, there were a few attachments at the very end that were presented that I don't think are yet publicly available, and we would appreciate being able to see those as well.

01:57:03.724 --> 01:57:03.965
Thank you.

01:57:10.592 --> 01:57:11.092
Good morning.

01:57:11.352 --> 01:57:15.995
I'm Sheila Whitley, and I'm here representing California Teachers Association.

01:57:16.776 --> 01:57:28.182
On behalf of California Teachers Association, thank you for continuing your commitment to include school climate as an important piece of the state accountability and continuous improvement system.

01:57:28.683 --> 01:57:32.285
And we appreciate the report and the information that was given this morning.

01:57:33.065 --> 01:57:39.249
We support the inclusion of data, use, and meaning in the proposed school climate self-reflection tool.

01:57:40.029 --> 01:57:52.741
We recommend that the language be even stronger and rather than suggested guiding questions that it needs required elements to be included in all narrative summary responses.

01:57:53.442 --> 01:57:54.163
Thank you very much.

01:57:59.226 --> 01:58:02.228
Good morning President Kirsten, Superintendent Torlakson, members of the board.

01:58:02.248 --> 01:58:06.031
My name is Jessica Sacco representing the California Science Teachers Association.

01:58:06.492 --> 01:58:10.054
I'm here to talk about the 2018 dashboard.

01:58:10.114 --> 01:58:14.538
Perhaps it'll be the 2019 dashboard because I can't imagine action will be taken on it today.

01:58:14.938 --> 01:58:25.982
However, I would like you to consider in future iterations of the dashboard that much as it has been done for chronic absenteeism and the CCI, that a placeholder be put on the dashboard for the science assessment.

01:58:26.342 --> 01:58:34.445
In 2016, this board committed to putting the CAST assessment on the dashboard when data was available to be able to be put on the dashboard.

01:58:34.905 --> 01:58:43.028
However, we have heard from our members in the field who work at district and county office levels that there is a little bit of doubt in the field that that will actually ever happen.

01:58:43.448 --> 01:58:56.797
And as we heard from our presenters this morning that talk about how they utilize the dashboard in their planning process, it becomes very important that they understand what's coming in the future and what future targets they might be expected to meet.

01:58:57.178 --> 01:59:01.721
Not just the outcomes that they're looking at right now, but also where they're going.

01:59:01.821 --> 01:59:04.943
And we feel that this is critically important to support NGSS implementation.

01:59:10.461 --> 01:59:28.175
I just wanted to comment on the presenters this morning at Castro Valley, how much we appreciated their commitment and responsibility for really promoting equity and how that manifests at the local level, and in particular, the connections they were making between the dashboard and their own local data and digging deeper.

01:59:28.775 --> 01:59:31.297
what we can do as a State to really support those efforts.

01:59:31.357 --> 01:59:37.600
So along those lines, seeing all the work that CDE is doing to try and continually improve the dashboard is really well received.

01:59:38.541 --> 01:59:41.823
We know that on this item you have a lot of things before you and that is included in our letter.

01:59:42.163 --> 01:59:51.849
The one thing I wanted to note was there was a conversation earlier about the 11th grade assessment and certainly from our perspective and kind of building on Super's comments that the

01:59:52.709 --> 01:59:58.234
use in the college and career indicator versus the standalone 11th grade assessment.

01:59:58.374 --> 01:59:59.715
Those are being used for different purposes.

01:59:59.755 --> 02:00:02.377
They're being used for student level versus LEA.

02:00:02.697 --> 02:00:11.504
They're also being used for individual student growth over time, whereas in the CCI, it's really about giving extra points for LEAs for demonstrating time.

02:00:12.104 --> 02:00:13.345
So we think that's important to note.

02:00:13.646 --> 02:00:14.106
Thank you so much.

02:00:19.639 --> 02:00:20.479
President Kirst.

02:00:20.619 --> 02:00:23.861
I'm Brian Rebus speaking on behalf of the Education Trust West.

02:00:24.761 --> 02:00:32.665
First I want to say we're supporting the funding in the governor's budget for improving and upgrading the dashboard and question whether it's enough.

02:00:33.265 --> 02:00:35.966
So please let us know if we can help with that.

02:00:36.026 --> 02:00:38.928
We want to make sure that you have the resources to do the job right.

02:00:40.168 --> 02:00:53.873
We like the work on the local indicator related to priority seven and access to a broad course of study is, I know all the indicators are important, but we think this one's especially important from an equity point of view.

02:00:54.853 --> 02:00:58.455
We would urge you to consider a couple more of what I would say are refinements.

02:00:59.375 --> 02:01:02.456
They have to do with adding or linking things to the dashboard.

02:01:03.957 --> 02:01:15.303
So we think it would be a good idea to add a link on the dashboard so that the public can access self-reflection tools that the districts use to measure broad course access.

02:01:15.763 --> 02:01:25.748
And we also think it'd be helpful to have some data on the dashboard disaggregated by race so that we can all see who's accessing things like A through G. Thank you.

02:01:31.384 --> 02:01:31.864
Good morning.

02:01:33.945 --> 02:01:37.766
Hi, I'm Liz with public advocates.

02:01:39.126 --> 02:01:43.968
I know you received the letter from the equity coalition and it comments on many things.

02:01:44.588 --> 02:01:51.890
I want to make sure we thank staff at state board and department for all the hard work they've been doing.

02:01:52.490 --> 02:01:53.430
It's pretty amazing.

02:01:54.571 --> 02:01:59.772
I want to focus on the priority seven indicator around broad course access.

02:02:00.192 --> 02:02:15.676
Appreciate the improvements being made on it but we think that there's an opportunity to make this a hybrid indicator for state data as well as local data and we've made recommendations with a suggestion in our attachment of a mock-up.

02:02:16.858 --> 02:02:21.583
and we urge you to have staff work on that, to consider that.

02:02:22.123 --> 02:02:29.331
On priority six around school climate, we support the refinement of the evaluation tool.

02:02:30.513 --> 02:02:35.158
Again, we think that that indicator should be measured like the other indicators.

02:02:35.638 --> 02:02:54.896
I want to highlight that we are working on budget advocacy as well as legislation to try to get more resources to school districts so that they can do these climate surveys on an annual basis and so that everyone is surveyed as well as engagement efforts.

02:02:55.116 --> 02:02:55.517
Thank you.

02:03:01.072 --> 02:03:02.954
Daniel Espinoza from the Learning Policy Institute.

02:03:03.635 --> 02:03:09.642
We thank the board for your commitment to and modeling of continuous improvement within the state's evolving accountability system.

02:03:10.003 --> 02:03:11.264
We offer three brief comments today.

02:03:11.625 --> 02:03:19.134
First, we support the proposed revision to the school climate self-reflection tool, given the importance of school climate and conditions to students' well-being and academic success.

02:03:19.594 --> 02:03:25.957
Examining data on school climate and disaggregated by school and student subgroup can be a key driver of continuous improvement efforts.

02:03:26.337 --> 02:03:31.740
Second, we appreciate the inclusion of three new measures of college and career preparedness in the college career indicator.

02:03:32.040 --> 02:03:39.083
And similar to many board members comments, we look forward to the inclusion of a well prepared category that can further incentivize both college and career preparation.

02:03:39.644 --> 02:03:44.626
Third, we repeat our support for the inclusion of the extended year graduation rates in California's accountability system.

02:03:45.147 --> 02:03:50.145
Such a measure is an important lever for equity that over 30 states have included in their accountability systems under ESSA.

02:03:50.447 --> 02:03:50.708
Thank you.

02:03:55.373 --> 02:03:59.437
Good morning Martha Alvarez on behalf of ACSA, the Association of California School Administrators.

02:04:00.337 --> 02:04:08.604
Thanks to all the staff, CDE and State Board for all of the work over the past several months to expand and make our accountability system and dashboard more robust.

02:04:09.125 --> 02:04:11.727
With that said, we did provide an extensive letter with comments.

02:04:12.368 --> 02:04:15.971
Particularly, we are appreciative of the annual review of our indicators.

02:04:16.811 --> 02:04:22.414
Specifically, we'd like to see more conversation and review of the chronic absenteeism and suspension rate definition.

02:04:22.895 --> 02:04:30.298
Those comments are in the letter regarding transient students and students who are medically ill and how do we capture them into the data.

02:04:31.119 --> 02:04:42.345
Regarding the automatic assignment of a REDD for any schools who do not submit their data on time, we are concerned and would object to the REDD category as it was previously stated by board members.

02:04:42.945 --> 02:04:50.066
So we urge the CDE to go back and come up with a different alternative, whether it be fiscally withholding money or any other alternative.

02:04:50.806 --> 02:04:55.447
Communicating the dashboard continues to be a challenge just because of the ever-evolving changes being made.

02:04:55.987 --> 02:05:01.108
We are willing to partner in working with administrators and make sure that they have the right tools to communicate it.

02:05:01.788 --> 02:05:03.329
Self-reflection tools, last comment.

02:05:03.809 --> 02:05:08.509
We just want to ensure that it does not become a mini LCAP or additional work for those in the ground.

02:05:08.709 --> 02:05:09.069
Thank you.

02:05:09.550 --> 02:05:11.910
And with me, I have an administrator to provide additional comments.

02:05:16.374 --> 02:05:16.854
Good morning.

02:05:19.155 --> 02:05:24.378
President Kerr, Superintendent Torlakson, members of the board, my name is Alfonso Garagarza.

02:05:24.398 --> 02:05:27.700
I'm a superintendent principal in wonderful Siskiyou County.

02:05:27.860 --> 02:05:30.762
My school is Butteville Union Elementary School District.

02:05:30.822 --> 02:05:40.107
I'm pleased to be here on behalf of AXA, small school districts, micro school districts that were formerly also pegged as frontier districts.

02:05:40.727 --> 02:05:42.088
That was interesting about 10 years ago.

02:05:43.288 --> 02:05:51.011
Administrators, we believe in the opportunity presented by the multiple measures as a system that focuses on teaching the whole child.

02:05:52.571 --> 02:05:56.553
A little context, my school enrolls about 202 students.

02:05:57.533 --> 02:06:09.657
In addition to myself, we have 12 teachers, 14 classified, 6th grade, all the way up to 6th grade, self-contained classroom, more or less of a 7th and 8th grade departmental setting.

02:06:12.461 --> 02:06:20.468
We are, believe it or not, actually a medium-sized district for Siskiyou County and we are proud.

02:06:20.488 --> 02:06:30.357
36 to 40% of our student population is on inter-district transfers to our school because of our wonderful teachers, our arts and performing arts programs.

02:06:30.377 --> 02:06:34.641
We're sort of a magnet school in that in spite of being 51% free and reduced,

02:06:36.082 --> 02:06:37.483
five English language learners.

02:06:37.903 --> 02:06:41.786
We have a super strong PTO, strong community and county support.

02:06:43.667 --> 02:06:49.611
But what does the dashboard mean to us, to our community and to our stakeholders?

02:06:49.871 --> 02:06:59.657
And it's my pleasure to know that or to express to you that, you know, the color coding components are being

02:07:01.297 --> 02:07:08.563
I have spoken about this morning with some areas of concern for small school districts in terms of turning red automatically.

02:07:08.583 --> 02:07:12.506
And that has to do with some of the metrics that are involved.

02:07:12.566 --> 02:07:16.449
If you just look at my EL population, five students, that's 20%.

02:07:17.189 --> 02:07:23.274
And if you extend that out to special ed and other significant subgroups, I may have 12 students.

02:07:23.995 --> 02:07:25.696
And yet I'm still compared to LA Unified.

02:07:26.497 --> 02:07:42.160
So we're looking for an opportunity for you to consider as a board an additional layer of review on those metrics that also assigns a number, a student count, prior to changing any colors or anything like that.

02:07:43.581 --> 02:07:54.689
And the fact that the self-reflection tool doesn't turn into a mini L-cap in addition to all that.

02:07:55.749 --> 02:08:02.674
My bus driver pulled an elk tag and went hunting for two weeks, and so I'm driving the bus for two weeks.

02:08:02.694 --> 02:08:11.961
So I'm not afraid of hard work, but it'd be nice to be able to consolidate and not create additional redundancy.

02:08:12.361 --> 02:08:13.402
Thank you very much for your time.

02:08:34.418 --> 02:08:44.706
Good morning, LeAngela Reed on behalf of the Small School Districts Association, although I can't be any more articulate than Superintendent Caragaza, but if you want me to explain what pulling an elk tag means, I'm happy to do that.

02:08:46.387 --> 02:08:51.090
So I will speak on behalf of the association, Small School Districts Association as a whole.

02:08:51.671 --> 02:08:59.176
We do share the concerns echoed relative to the automatic indicator, red to orange, particularly in some of these areas where we're still getting the feel of things.

02:09:00.077 --> 02:09:02.498
So I'd like to have a little more time and thought

02:09:03.619 --> 02:09:05.041
on that before we make that change.

02:09:05.681 --> 02:09:25.900
Relative to the CCIs, as you can imagine, some of us who have worked really hard to get to that end are a little nervous about the fact that it's an OR, but I think the way the documents have been shared, the fact that it's a slash and that we're getting to the end and we're really talking about it always being a mix regardless, and if we continue to have that conversation, I think that will be important as we move forward and finally get to

02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:28.702
fully to well prepared.

02:09:29.543 --> 02:09:31.425
I want to take a moment to thank C.D.

02:09:31.465 --> 02:09:36.289
Easton and particularly Jacqueline for the conversations with small school districts relative to.

02:09:36.309 --> 02:09:36.689
Time.

02:09:37.090 --> 02:09:37.370
Thank you.

02:09:37.630 --> 02:09:39.191
Relative to the self-reflection tool.

02:09:39.412 --> 02:09:40.913
Those changes are evident in here.

02:09:41.253 --> 02:09:43.155
She took the time to meet with about six superintendents.

02:09:43.475 --> 02:09:46.578
It was really wonderful and I think it's reflected well so thank you.

02:09:48.464 --> 02:09:50.946
Okay, that concludes the public testimony.

02:09:51.006 --> 02:09:56.930
We do have a CDE recommendation for action and maybe one of our liaisons.

02:09:57.870 --> 02:10:09.338
I would move the department recommendation to approve the revision to the self-reflection tool for priority six and the proposed standard and self-assessment tool for priority seven.

02:10:09.518 --> 02:10:09.898
Second.

02:10:11.599 --> 02:10:14.381
Okay, any further board discussion?

02:10:15.620 --> 02:10:16.541
If not, all those in favor.

02:10:17.382 --> 02:10:18.062
Board discussion.

02:10:18.102 --> 02:10:18.803
Board member Williams.

02:10:20.785 --> 02:10:23.767
I'm supportive of the of that motion and the recommendation.

02:10:23.847 --> 02:10:36.859
This is going to surprise probably most of you that I'm totally supportive of the California Science Teachers Association request that we put a place saver on the dashboard that indicates as

02:10:37.399 --> 02:10:50.471
Member Burr made the motion in May 2016 that we would include results of the NGSS state summative test in the state accountability system once it was operational and considered valid.

02:10:50.871 --> 02:10:54.814
I know that's years off and it could certainly wait until next year.

02:10:55.875 --> 02:11:02.457
But there is a field test, a complete census field test this spring of the NGSS, a summative assessment.

02:11:02.797 --> 02:11:05.898
And the next year, if all goes well, it will be operational.

02:11:06.418 --> 02:11:17.741
And so knowing for all the field to know that it's coming and that will be reported will provide a really powerful incentive to help with these last years of implementation.

02:11:18.261 --> 02:11:24.883
I'm assuming it can't be done this year, but I just want to put it on the table that I support it for next year as soon as it can be done.

02:11:25.383 --> 02:11:26.103
the place saver.

02:11:28.084 --> 02:11:30.485
I think we're ready for the vote.

02:11:30.585 --> 02:11:31.945
All those in favor, raise your hands.

02:11:34.106 --> 02:11:35.807
Okay, carries unanimously.

02:11:35.967 --> 02:11:49.391
So we're on to item two and this is a no action item and update item and Melanie will lead this and we will start with also with some presentations.

02:12:10.540 --> 02:12:14.023
Good morning, President Kerr, Superintendent Torlakson, members of the board.

02:12:14.043 --> 02:12:18.786
I am Melanie Sheppy, the Director of the Improvement and Accountability Division.

02:12:19.727 --> 02:12:31.535
Item two is intended to be a short information only update on California system of support for local educational agencies and schools.

02:12:34.618 --> 02:12:37.703
I will say if I'm short of breath, I don't need medical attention.

02:12:37.883 --> 02:12:39.325
I'm just almost seven months pregnant.

02:12:39.466 --> 02:12:44.233
So bear with me as I also try to keep the momentum of the item moving.

02:12:45.415 --> 02:12:48.399
But I just appreciate being in front of you today to provide this short update.

02:12:49.585 --> 02:12:56.429
First, we will highlight some of the work underway to strengthen our level one support for all local educational agencies and schools.

02:12:57.129 --> 02:13:08.115
Then we will highlight a partnership approach to differentiated assistance between the Dulce Palos Oro Linda School District, the Merced County Office of Education, and the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence.

02:13:08.936 --> 02:13:10.037
Then we'll close for questions.

02:13:10.857 --> 02:13:17.301
You'll note that in the posted item, we provided updates on the differentiated assistance process across county offices.

02:13:18.160 --> 02:13:22.664
At our May meeting, we will have county superintendents available to speak to those updates.

02:13:23.184 --> 02:13:32.052
However, for today's short update, we will focus on one partnership to highlight how multiple support providers can work together to support a district community.

02:13:34.963 --> 02:13:38.464
Keep this goal in mind as we discuss the updates today.

02:13:39.245 --> 02:13:44.227
Reflect on if the highlighted work is measuring up to our system of supports goal.

02:13:45.007 --> 02:13:55.451
Consider if the work focuses on building capacity so that communities can sustain improvement and does it effectively address inequities in student opportunities and outcomes.

02:13:57.236 --> 02:14:03.700
Let's dive into updates on support for all local educational agencies and schools.

02:14:04.540 --> 02:14:10.023
As I mentioned in January, stakeholders have asked for tools to help them identify successes and strengths across California.

02:14:10.744 --> 02:14:19.449
Given your feedback from our January meeting on the GIS tool demonstration, staff has started mapping the performance levels for each indicator across California.

02:14:20.149 --> 02:14:28.593
In a few weeks, the public will be able to view districts and schools who have green and blue performance levels by each indicator spatially on a map of California.

02:14:29.193 --> 02:14:31.714
We'll also post training materials for how to use that tool.

02:14:35.177 --> 02:14:41.101
Another highlight of support for all districts and schools is the ongoing communication about the system of support.

02:14:41.842 --> 02:14:53.350
The extended system of support planning group, which now includes the agencies charged with support under the local control funding formula, stakeholder groups representing parents, students, and educators,

02:14:54.562 --> 02:15:05.068
and practitioners from the field have worked together to create a resource to clarify topics of importance that have arisen about our new statewide system of support and differentiated assistance.

02:15:06.124 --> 02:15:13.949
This is an example of how the state agencies, stakeholders, and practitioners in the field can work together to respond to needs as they surface.

02:15:14.810 --> 02:15:26.978
This example is also illustrative of how the extended planning group can get started on a need, make progress, and then come back to reassess what else is needed after completing this initial work together.

02:15:27.458 --> 02:15:34.825
Because you and I both know shared communication is only a step in the need to further support stakeholder engagement out in the field.

02:15:34.986 --> 02:15:37.949
But it's an important step that this group was able to come together and create.

02:15:38.930 --> 02:15:40.831
You'll find that resource in attachment three.

02:15:43.995 --> 02:15:50.241
Next, we'll have a brief update on level one resources related to data and evaluation from the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence.

02:15:59.090 --> 02:15:59.490
Good morning.

02:16:00.091 --> 02:16:05.154
President Kirst, Superintendent Torlakson, honorable members of the board, my name is E. Shryaroo.

02:16:05.174 --> 02:16:08.016
I'm the Assistant Director of Training and Outreach for the CCEE.

02:16:08.756 --> 02:16:13.319
And as Melanie mentioned at the outset, this is intended to be short, so I have a timer with me.

02:16:13.599 --> 02:16:17.662
And although I'll keep it brief, I'm obviously happy to answer any questions you might have at the end.

02:16:19.583 --> 02:16:26.768
So we were asked to speak to the modules that we do and to offer a few different comments about the data and evaluation module in particular.

02:16:27.586 --> 02:16:31.351
So the purpose of the training modules that the CCEE does is listed there for you.

02:16:31.511 --> 02:16:36.236
We're working to establish a common baseline for using the dashboard and LCAP as tools for continuous improvement.

02:16:37.177 --> 02:16:44.786
We started that work with large-scale events in fall 2016 and spring 2017 going across the state and holding these in-person sessions.

02:16:45.567 --> 02:16:54.930
After a lot of reflection, talking with folks in the field, reviewing surveys, we switched then to a modules-based approach, which is looking at very specific topics.

02:16:55.531 --> 02:16:57.491
And the sessions are generally shorter.

02:16:57.551 --> 02:17:04.954
So as opposed to these close-to-full-day sessions that were in person before, these modules are often much shorter, and people can access them in lots of different ways.

02:17:06.383 --> 02:17:08.363
Here's our attempt to define a module.

02:17:09.084 --> 02:17:14.165
It is a professional development opportunity that's focused on some LCFF-related topic of interest.

02:17:14.905 --> 02:17:17.926
Like I said, it could be structured in any number of ways.

02:17:18.066 --> 02:17:20.806
Many of them have been online, structured like a webinar.

02:17:21.566 --> 02:17:24.027
Each module that we have includes those three things.

02:17:24.267 --> 02:17:27.908
There's one part that's an overview of the topic for all audiences.

02:17:28.948 --> 02:17:32.290
There's a second part, which is designed for some specific audience.

02:17:33.131 --> 02:17:36.713
And in all of our modules, we partner with the county office of education.

02:17:37.273 --> 02:17:40.996
The role that they play varies a bit, depending on what works best for them.

02:17:41.376 --> 02:17:45.438
They often provide input and often support in content development.

02:17:45.699 --> 02:17:47.880
And in many cases, they co-facilitate our trainings.

02:17:50.925 --> 02:17:57.908
So based on survey results, these were the four topical areas that we focused on for our trainings.

02:17:58.028 --> 02:18:06.492
And again, each one of those four bulleted topics includes two parts, one that is designed for all audiences and another that's designed for some particular audience.

02:18:07.352 --> 02:18:13.975
As I mentioned at the outset, we wanted to provide just a handful of comments on data and evaluation because I think there was some interest there.

02:18:16.383 --> 02:18:24.249
So for part one of data and evaluation, which again is designed for all audiences, we wanted to look at this idea of dashboard literacy.

02:18:24.449 --> 02:18:26.790
We knew that some of our trainings provided updates.

02:18:27.151 --> 02:18:32.374
We talked about what were some of the updates since spring of 2017 for the dashboard that you might want to know.

02:18:32.494 --> 02:18:40.120
And instead of just going into updates, this idea was to dive in deeper to look at specific reports and to go into greater detail generally.

02:18:40.720 --> 02:18:50.209
We partnered with Humboldt County Office of Education, and as you can see there, we had our part one session designed for all audiences on February 8th, with approximately 200 virtual participants.

02:18:51.189 --> 02:18:55.774
And these were the topics that we addressed in that part one session designed for everybody.

02:18:56.294 --> 02:19:03.621
I'll just call out one idea, which is that we consistently received feedback that folks wanted to hear about distance from level three.

02:19:04.201 --> 02:19:21.295
and could we explain it in some way that would both allow the participants to understand distance from level three, but also be able to turn around and talk with their constituents, district administrators talking with school administrators, school administrators talking with teachers about distance from level three and making sure that everybody understands it.

02:19:21.475 --> 02:19:23.637
You can see then the other topics that we explored as well.

02:19:26.055 --> 02:19:36.218
For part two of data and evaluation, so we went from an audience that was inclusive of virtually everyone to an audience that was focused on the needs of small schools and districts.

02:19:36.678 --> 02:19:47.122
We have heard so much from small schools and districts that they want to understand how they can best use the dashboard and also how they can use other sources of data to complement the dashboard.

02:19:47.802 --> 02:19:50.584
Again, Humboldt County was integral in this work.

02:19:51.225 --> 02:19:55.428
They have a number of small LEAs in their community, so it was great to have their insights.

02:19:55.889 --> 02:20:00.953
We had another Zoom session this time with approximately 100 participants, and you can see here what we addressed.

02:20:01.673 --> 02:20:03.695
I'll zoom in just on that second bullet.

02:20:03.815 --> 02:20:14.544
For part two, we looked at an optional protocol that small schools and districts might use if they don't see a performance level on the academic indicator for English language arts and math.

02:20:17.526 --> 02:20:26.671
All of the resources from the PowerPoint presentation to the video of the presentation itself to links that we referenced during the presentation can be accessed on our website.

02:20:27.472 --> 02:20:37.077
The first link is for part one, which again was designed for all audiences, and the second link there was specifically resources for small districts and schools.

02:20:39.239 --> 02:20:40.439
And Melanie, I think I'm good.

02:20:42.640 --> 02:20:43.281
All right.

02:20:46.024 --> 02:20:49.527
And each will be staying to answer questions at the end, of course.

02:20:49.627 --> 02:20:51.289
I'm excited now to switch gears.

02:20:51.369 --> 02:20:57.395
So you've just heard a few brief highlights of level one support, support that's available for all districts and schools.

02:20:58.216 --> 02:21:02.760
Now we're gonna focus to a highlight on a partnership for differentiated assistance.

02:21:03.040 --> 02:21:10.087
Today we'll focus on the partnership between Dos Palos Orlando School District, the Merced County Office of Education, and the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence.

02:21:16.803 --> 02:21:18.425
Good morning and welcome, everyone.

02:21:18.445 --> 02:21:20.667
Thank you for allowing us to join you.

02:21:21.087 --> 02:21:33.119
I'm Socorro Shields, Director of Education for the California Collaborative, with team members here from Merced County Office of Ed and Dos Palos Superintendent, and they'll introduce themselves in just one moment.

02:21:35.214 --> 02:21:39.617
As you know, you heard Eash earlier talking about the professional development.

02:21:39.677 --> 02:21:54.187
Another effort of the collaborative has been the partnership work, long-term, side-by-side partnership work, really actualizing, giving meaning to whatever this work in continuous improvement looks like for districts in the field.

02:21:54.728 --> 02:21:59.791
And to that end, we've been working together with county offices, really thinking about this

02:22:01.201 --> 02:22:03.042
time in our accountability system?

02:22:03.082 --> 02:22:09.523
What does that look like when all of these things might happen to a district at once, when they're experiencing all of these opportunities?

02:22:09.963 --> 02:22:10.944
Does it make sense?

02:22:11.384 --> 02:22:18.386
And so we're very proud that with Merced County Office of Education, we've really been able to learn together, plan together.

02:22:18.766 --> 02:22:19.846
Will this make sense?

02:22:20.166 --> 02:22:26.288
And you'll hear from Dos Palos about their experience and how it felt as a recipient hearing the intention as well.

02:22:27.108 --> 02:22:35.673
And when we, I think you've seen this before, but we really talk about kind of what the phases were in our partnership work with all of our districts.

02:22:35.733 --> 02:22:38.734
And as you'll recall, they were volunteer districts.

02:22:38.754 --> 02:22:44.517
So we believed that some of them might end up in the accountability schema.

02:22:44.557 --> 02:22:47.619
We didn't know, they didn't know when they volunteered for this work.

02:22:48.086 --> 02:22:56.911
But it really was about kind of putting meat on the bones about what continuous improvement is and how do you support people going through that.

02:22:57.391 --> 02:23:13.640
And so this really was about kind of how we got to know the district and then specifically build capacity with the county offices and with the Carnegie Center around what continuous improvement means on the ground for people who are literally doing this improvement work every day.

02:23:14.720 --> 02:23:19.522
And so that kind of sets the stage of what our summits look like, and we bring teams together.

02:23:19.562 --> 02:23:27.545
We've grown this to include not only the superintendent, but district-level leadership, site-level leadership, and teachers.

02:23:27.925 --> 02:23:40.751
So created teams of these districts to come and learn and work together, have these shared learning experiences about what it means, and develop kind of a learning continuum so that they can make meaning together as a team.

02:23:42.111 --> 02:23:52.598
of educators about what this means and thankfully county offices have been with us as we're doing these opportunities with districts and so we've been partners the whole time.

02:23:52.998 --> 02:23:58.202
I'll let Merced County talk more about kind of how they framed their differentiated assistance work.

02:24:02.332 --> 02:24:12.780
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, the Board, Board President, State Superintendent Francisco Romo from Merced County Office of Education, also Differentiate Assistance member.

02:24:14.501 --> 02:24:17.804
In essence, happy to be here and from the Central Valley.

02:24:18.424 --> 02:24:26.610
When we think about Differentiate Assistance and the Differentiate Assistance Guide that was provided to county offices, there are very nice resources within that guide.

02:24:26.911 --> 02:24:28.372
Within that, you have six steps.

02:24:29.019 --> 02:24:30.000
You have the dashboard dive.

02:24:30.580 --> 02:24:32.201
You have it looking at the local indicators.

02:24:32.722 --> 02:24:33.522
You have an L.A.

02:24:33.582 --> 02:24:41.628
self-assessment, a root cause analysis, and an opportunity to do the work a little bit different or a lot different.

02:24:42.168 --> 02:24:50.554
Merced County Office of Education, we've been infusing the six Cs from Dr. Michael Folan in our work, in all our networks, the Curriculum Learning Network,

02:24:51.209 --> 02:24:56.210
the Categorical English Learner Network, LCAP workshops, and also into the differentiate assistance.

02:24:56.470 --> 02:25:05.872
And what that means is intentionally thinking about creativity, communication, citizenship, critical thinking, character, and collaboration.

02:25:06.052 --> 02:25:11.954
And what does that look like within this new improvement science, continuous improvement?

02:25:12.594 --> 02:25:17.295
So today we'll have one of our districts talk about that partnership and our intentionality about that.

02:25:18.257 --> 02:25:22.740
Tomorrow we finish our differentiated assistance with our last of eight school districts.

02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:25.141
Wonderful journey.

02:25:25.801 --> 02:25:31.565
Within that, also, because the district's requests, those forms have been different.

02:25:33.486 --> 02:25:39.629
Three of our districts asked for, can we pair up since we're TK8s together?

02:25:39.749 --> 02:25:43.751
So one cohort was a cohort of three of our districts that were TK8.

02:25:45.382 --> 02:25:48.963
Another cohort was three other districts from TK-12.

02:25:49.003 --> 02:25:55.466
That was at the request of the districts through this journey, because they wanted to live these six Cs.

02:25:56.066 --> 02:26:01.628
The other two independently wanted to work individually, so that was the differentiated assistance for them.

02:26:02.368 --> 02:26:12.872
So what that said is, I'd like to be able to pass it on to my colleague, Dr. Ozzy De Luna, and then have our district tell their journey.

02:26:16.755 --> 02:26:19.376
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and State Superintendent.

02:26:19.916 --> 02:26:23.337
As we think about the work, there's policies pushing down on schools.

02:26:24.137 --> 02:26:25.398
We think about how we work.

02:26:25.998 --> 02:26:32.220
The work is, we have structures in place, and we think about how the human dynamic, how people work, how we build trust.

02:26:32.918 --> 02:26:36.824
how we build a relationship to ask critical questions of student success.

02:26:37.344 --> 02:26:43.774
When we think about the students who may not have access, we need to have that trust and relationship to dig deeper and say, what might work here?

02:26:44.114 --> 02:26:47.679
And then how might we transfer that to where the students are failing?

02:26:48.300 --> 02:26:52.943
So we ask those questions to see where our beliefs might be, our values, our purpose.

02:26:53.424 --> 02:27:02.190
And if we think about our purpose, the student success, it's about how we use our structures to support our adults, to support our schools, to support our students.

02:27:02.530 --> 02:27:03.871
And the outcome is the students.

02:27:04.471 --> 02:27:08.514
It's how we trust each other in asking those questions that are critical for success.

02:27:09.155 --> 02:27:09.455
So Bill?

02:27:14.377 --> 02:27:17.559
Good morning, President Kurtz, Superintendent Torlakson, members of the board.

02:27:18.040 --> 02:27:19.461
I'm happy to be with you this morning.

02:27:19.481 --> 02:27:21.002
I appreciate this opportunity.

02:27:21.442 --> 02:27:28.468
My name is Bill Spaulding, and I'm in my second year as superintendent of the Dos Palos Oro Loma Joint Unified School District in Western Merced County.

02:27:29.008 --> 02:27:30.029
We're a rural district.

02:27:30.169 --> 02:27:32.831
Our community, Dos Palos, is 2.2 square miles.

02:27:33.312 --> 02:27:34.232
We have 2,500 students, but 5,300 in the community.

02:27:38.435 --> 02:27:45.298
We are a district that covers 600 square miles in rural western Merced County.

02:27:45.318 --> 02:28:02.786
We are 90% free and reduced, 28% EL, 78% Latino, a fairly typical Central Valley community, a small town, and a community that is going through some economic transitions, not all good, but dealing with a lot of issues.

02:28:04.106 --> 02:28:20.537
When I first came to the school district a couple of years ago, and you might remember me from about a year ago, talking about CCEE, we were invited by our county superintendent at the time to be a part of a pilot with the CCEE.

02:28:20.637 --> 02:28:22.138
So, we joined 10 other districts.

02:28:22.638 --> 02:28:24.699
and became a pilot district with the CCEE.

02:28:25.299 --> 02:28:32.482
And you might remember that we came, Dr. Tietjen, Steve Tietjen came with me last time to talk a little bit about what that experience has been.

02:28:33.082 --> 02:28:39.264
More recently, we became a differentiated assistance district in our county, one of eight in the county.

02:28:39.664 --> 02:28:43.926
And to be honest with you, when we first got into the pilot program,

02:28:44.446 --> 02:28:49.547
We got in because we pretty much anticipated that we were going to meet with differentiated assistance.

02:28:51.148 --> 02:29:05.712
Our arc, our trajectory over the last several years, both through CSTs, the old API measure, and then more recently the CASP and the dashboard, really had us struggling in some of our academic areas.

02:29:06.352 --> 02:29:09.532
We knew that was going to happen, so we wanted to embrace that rather than dodge it.

02:29:09.873 --> 02:29:11.213
We didn't want to wait to be told.

02:29:11.753 --> 02:29:16.877
So when I did get the phone call in December from Dr. Tietjen, we were not surprised.

02:29:17.897 --> 02:29:19.858
We were aware that this was happening.

02:29:20.499 --> 02:29:26.123
And the communication we had done with our board and with our community was, we're getting into this pilot because we want to get better.

02:29:26.583 --> 02:29:28.684
We want to get into this pilot because we want to improve.

02:29:29.165 --> 02:29:34.008
And we believe that CCEE will learn from our experience, but we will also learn from that.

02:29:34.508 --> 02:29:40.332
And if we get in at the ground floor, we could see some early gains and make improvements right away.

02:29:40.792 --> 02:29:44.495
So, for us, differentiated assistance has not been a big deal.

02:29:44.735 --> 02:29:50.359
Not that it's not important, not that it isn't something that you need to take seriously, but we knew it was coming.

02:29:50.379 --> 02:29:53.862
And I know not every district has had that experience, but for us, we did.

02:29:53.922 --> 02:29:58.545
We saw it coming, we embraced it, and we feel good about how we're going about it.

02:29:59.046 --> 02:30:03.069
I talked a little bit last year about some of our efforts with CCEE.

02:30:03.849 --> 02:30:07.733
And we continue to go almost monthly to the CCEE summits.

02:30:08.353 --> 02:30:18.423
We've expanded our team at the district to include myself, my assistant superintendent, the president of our teachers association, and a middle school principal.

02:30:19.043 --> 02:30:28.333
And with that kind of broad base of representation, I think we represent the district very well and we're able to bring back a lot of what we're learning at CCEE to our district.

02:30:29.474 --> 02:30:41.387
Because we have our CTA president involved, we've been able to really work more directly and really get our unions to focus and join with us as we work on our improvement efforts.

02:30:41.867 --> 02:30:47.873
The other thing that we've been doing is that we were involved with a CCESA training on the science of improvement.

02:30:47.933 --> 02:30:52.016
Both my assistant superintendent and I attended the three sessions.

02:30:52.957 --> 02:30:56.420
We got some help from CCE to get us in there.

02:30:56.480 --> 02:30:59.603
There weren't that many districts that got to participate, but we did.

02:30:59.623 --> 02:31:00.784
What we have found is

02:31:03.146 --> 02:31:18.173
We've been able to use first the coherence framework from Dr. Michael Fullan, and then more recently, the science of improvement book that we have from Dr. Mayhew, and really start to implement the science of improvement mindset with our leadership and throughout our district.

02:31:18.553 --> 02:31:25.737
I joked the other day when Ozzie and Socorro were in our conference room, we had fish bones all over the place.

02:31:26.257 --> 02:31:30.479
And I said, you know, there are more fish bones, there's more fish on the wall here than you'd find in a red lobster.

02:31:31.159 --> 02:31:37.166
We're really delving into that process.

02:31:37.226 --> 02:31:38.748
Here's the fishbone.

02:31:40.370 --> 02:31:42.632
This is looking at PBIS.

02:31:42.672 --> 02:31:46.456
The fishbone process, if you're not familiar with it, is a root cause analysis.

02:31:46.496 --> 02:31:47.578
It's one of many tools.

02:31:48.038 --> 02:31:52.039
that are available through the science of improvement that we wouldn't have known about had we not had that training.

02:31:52.679 --> 02:32:02.280
But we were able to start working on that with individual situations and problems and to start to really look at what are our issues and how can we go about working on those issues.

02:32:02.300 --> 02:32:09.622
One of the things we try to avoid is something that those of you who have studied this or seen this, called solutionitis.

02:32:10.442 --> 02:32:13.022
The desire to jump in, fix the problem.

02:32:13.202 --> 02:32:16.623
We're all checkbox people, or most of us, or many of us, I'm a checkbox person.

02:32:17.363 --> 02:32:18.764
We checkbox people.

02:32:19.004 --> 02:32:20.825
We have a reading problem, let's buy a program.

02:32:21.126 --> 02:32:23.227
We didn't like how it worked out this year, let's buy a new one.

02:32:23.567 --> 02:32:26.969
We've got another situation with tutoring, let's buy a new tutor.

02:32:27.009 --> 02:32:29.791
We don't like that, after a year, let's go to something else.

02:32:30.271 --> 02:32:34.614
This has really forced a discipline on us to really look long and hard at our issues,

02:32:35.154 --> 02:32:51.919
and to try to determine what are the causes, what are the changes that we can make that can have a high impact long-term, and what are the changes we can make that can have a shorter-term impact, because sometimes you need those short-term wins to start to really move things forward.

02:32:52.379 --> 02:33:02.006
So that's one kind of portion of the work that we've been doing and a lot of that has come through our work with the science of improvement training through CCEE and partially through the county.

02:33:02.386 --> 02:33:08.711
But what I really want to give the county office credit for is that they've been working with us really all along in a very tight partnership

02:33:09.131 --> 02:33:09.912
with CCEE.

02:33:09.992 --> 02:33:28.784
We see Socorro at just about every one of our sessions, and we see Ozzie at about every one of our sessions, and we work very closely with Francisco through the whole differentiated assistance process and developing the LCAP revisions that we want to make in support of our improvements.

02:33:30.425 --> 02:33:37.691
And so working together, really as a team, and we're working very, very closely together, we've been able to integrate all these kinds of things in a way that have meaning.

02:33:38.151 --> 02:33:40.393
And it's really changed the culture of our leadership.

02:33:40.413 --> 02:33:47.139
One of the things that we've tried to be very intentional about is developing the capacity for this to grow and for this to be sustained.

02:33:47.579 --> 02:33:52.743
I think a lot of times you bring a book study to your leadership, you bring a book study to your district, everybody reads the book.

02:33:52.803 --> 02:33:53.984
My friend calls it church camp.

02:33:54.144 --> 02:33:58.588
Everybody reads the book, everybody feels good for a while, and then you go on to something else, it becomes a fad.

02:33:59.108 --> 02:34:06.196
One of the things that we've been working with Ozzie on from the county office is he comes and works with our leadership team.

02:34:06.216 --> 02:34:17.548
We meet once a month and we do some very serious team building and some very serious work, both around the relationships that we have with one another, the relationships of our team, and also around the content of the work that we're doing with this.

02:34:18.009 --> 02:34:20.812
And we have really strengthened our district leadership as a team.

02:34:21.232 --> 02:34:26.294
that I was joking today, if I were to get hit by a bus on the way back today, this work would go on.

02:34:26.434 --> 02:34:27.214
It's not just me.

02:34:27.355 --> 02:34:28.235
It's not just a book.

02:34:28.395 --> 02:34:29.535
It's not just this year.

02:34:30.096 --> 02:34:31.356
It's work that is sustained.

02:34:32.336 --> 02:34:34.938
So I guess that was my only picture.

02:34:35.058 --> 02:34:35.878
Oh, here's my other picture.

02:34:36.778 --> 02:34:41.240
The high-impact, low-impact, high-leverage, low-effort, and high-effort.

02:34:41.360 --> 02:34:57.828
These are the quadrants we use to try to take some of those ways of dealing with causes and issues and to determine which ones we can deal with more long-term and which ones we can deal with more short-term to have a high impact and to start making movement.

02:34:58.468 --> 02:35:00.448
So we're doing some work around various things.

02:35:00.488 --> 02:35:21.173
Like I said, we've done fish bones, we've done empathy interviews, we've looked hard at our PBIS program, you know, around how we're doing with our student support and culture, and we're really delving into our areas of academics and looking hard at our ELA and our mathematics and where the areas that where we need to make growth.

02:35:21.673 --> 02:35:28.720
One thing I wanted to add is something that has happened through the differentiated assistance model is very different from what I am used to.

02:35:29.020 --> 02:35:36.247
I go back long enough to be able to remember the IAUSP process, the high priority schools process.

02:35:36.487 --> 02:35:43.093
I was a date provider for a while, so I inflicted that on some people.

02:35:43.113 --> 02:35:44.415
I know that old model.

02:35:45.015 --> 02:35:48.537
This is a very different model and it feels very different from our point of view.

02:35:49.018 --> 02:36:04.869
So when we went into our first meeting for a deep dive into our dashboard with the county office, I have to say there was a little bit of stress, a little worry, because now we're going to start talking about what's wrong.

02:36:05.869 --> 02:36:20.005
and we spent three solid hours and what was really impressive is that my assistant superintendent and I, although we talk every day, we never had three hours ever to sit down and really delve into things in quiet, you know, where the phone's not ringing, where people aren't coming in.

02:36:20.446 --> 02:36:21.527
We never had that kind of time.

02:36:21.887 --> 02:36:26.653
So now we had the time with the differentiated assistance team at Merced County Office of Ed,

02:36:27.173 --> 02:36:34.725
to really delve into our dashboard, look into the tables, look at our groups, look at our CASP scores, look at our trends, look at three-year trends.

02:36:35.666 --> 02:36:40.614
We came out with a two-page spreadsheet list of everything that we noticed.

02:36:41.624 --> 02:36:43.726
And a lot of things that we noticed were positive.

02:36:44.347 --> 02:36:52.654
A lot of things that we noticed through this new dashboard process where we used to get worked up about our English and our math scores and feel bad and feel terrible about what we were doing.

02:36:53.095 --> 02:36:54.276
Now we're talking about suspensions.

02:36:54.636 --> 02:36:56.117
Now we're talking about chronic absence.

02:36:56.438 --> 02:36:57.939
Now we're talking about graduation rates.

02:36:58.239 --> 02:36:59.440
Now we're talking about college career.

02:36:59.761 --> 02:37:01.262
And there are areas where we're excelling.

02:37:01.863 --> 02:37:05.346
There are areas where we have the highest graduation rates in Merced County.

02:37:05.806 --> 02:37:09.929
We have the highest ELA scores for 11th grade in Merced County.

02:37:09.969 --> 02:37:17.574
Two-thirds of our 11th graders are on the CASP ELA are meeting or exceeding standards.

02:37:18.034 --> 02:37:20.096
That's not the story with all of our other grades.

02:37:20.516 --> 02:37:25.659
So we were able to do an empathy interview to sit down with our 11th or actually all our high school teachers.

02:37:26.100 --> 02:37:26.680
What are you doing?

02:37:27.100 --> 02:37:27.821
What's the difference?

02:37:27.961 --> 02:37:28.882
What's your secret sauce?

02:37:29.042 --> 02:37:30.142
How are you making this happen?

02:37:30.503 --> 02:37:35.526
And we learned a lot from that process that we're going to carry out to the remainder of our district.

02:37:35.946 --> 02:37:39.348
So, it's not only surfacing the issues and the concerns that you have.

02:37:39.369 --> 02:37:42.391
It's not just surfacing the things that aren't going well.

02:37:42.871 --> 02:37:44.752
It also surfaces the things that are going well.

02:37:45.052 --> 02:37:46.233
And we have a number of things that are.

02:37:46.273 --> 02:37:47.654
So, you get a more balanced view.

02:37:48.395 --> 02:37:49.855
So, that's been our experience.

02:37:50.156 --> 02:37:51.917
It feels very integrated.

02:37:52.357 --> 02:37:53.238
It feels very tight.

02:37:53.358 --> 02:38:00.142
It feels like there's great integration and cooperation and collaboration between our three entities.

02:38:00.803 --> 02:38:04.245
And I couldn't be happier with the process that we've been taking on so far.

02:38:05.266 --> 02:38:05.546
Thank you.

02:38:06.787 --> 02:38:14.172
Yeah.

02:38:15.762 --> 02:38:18.383
So in closing, I want to highlight our next steps.

02:38:18.864 --> 02:38:22.386
We'll continue to engage with stakeholders on what's working and what they need.

02:38:22.886 --> 02:38:26.448
We'll engage in collaborative feedback with other agencies and organizations.

02:38:27.088 --> 02:38:33.232
And we'll also continue to coordinate and align the work of each agency through the expanded system of support planning group.

02:38:33.712 --> 02:38:37.074
So we still have all our presenters here, and we would like to close for any questions.

02:38:38.174 --> 02:38:39.035
Board member questions.

02:38:42.016 --> 02:38:42.857
Board member Strauss.

02:38:44.495 --> 02:38:48.038
I want to thank the presenters and Melanie for putting this together.

02:38:48.058 --> 02:39:12.356
I know you're tight on time because of the extensive length of this particular day of our agenda, but I think one of the things that as a policy and practitioner, a policymaker and practitioner, I think about is it's great to spend a couple years putting together a policy, but we're really interested in seeing how this does impact, in fact, improvement work for the areas we've identified and how local districts and counties are using this information.

02:39:13.417 --> 02:39:16.279
You did say Melanie at the beginning that you were limited today.

02:39:16.299 --> 02:39:19.923
All you wanted to highlight and I want to thank the district and the county for coming.

02:39:19.943 --> 02:39:22.565
It's really helpful to do the theory to practice connection.

02:39:22.905 --> 02:39:27.710
And my understanding is that you have plans for more of this work in May.

02:39:28.030 --> 02:39:37.419
I guess I would just say as one voice, I would really like to see a little more time to the next steps in system of support and what we're doing.

02:39:37.979 --> 02:39:43.161
what CCEE is learning from their pilots, what the next steps are that counties are doing.

02:39:43.481 --> 02:39:51.324
I know we built on Riverside County last time, which was really exemplary in my opinion, and I've heard from other superintendents saying it really helped to raise the bar for people.

02:39:51.985 --> 02:40:00.468
So these kind of opportunities to hear how this is making a difference, I think many of us remember many of the different systems that we've been under and trying to illustrate that it is different, but

02:40:01.048 --> 02:40:06.193
What are we really doing to impact practice so that things are better for kids and achievement is improving?

02:40:06.234 --> 02:40:16.884
So I just would I know you may have some plans for May, but I'd like to spend a little more time on what the next steps are and what the practices are as we continue to refine the system.

02:40:17.245 --> 02:40:17.485
Thanks.

02:40:18.125 --> 02:40:18.406
Thank you.

02:40:20.827 --> 02:40:23.108
So I just want to also express my appreciation.

02:40:23.748 --> 02:40:34.871
Superintendent Torlakson and I get to spend our time in our off months hearing what CCEE is doing, so I especially want to thank the CCEE staff for being here to share with the State Board.

02:40:34.891 --> 02:40:42.913
It was also really helpful to hear for a second year from Dos Palos and Merced, because we heard kind of at the very beginning.

02:40:44.173 --> 02:40:52.044
I really appreciate the superintendent's comments about how that's changed, how the prep work really led to what's happening now.

02:40:52.405 --> 02:41:00.116
And just to reinforce, and again, thank you for talking about multiple measures, because this is the second time we've heard this morning from a district about

02:41:00.596 --> 02:41:14.200
how valuable that is, both because you get to celebrate successes, you're not just pounded on test scores, but you also get to identify areas of strengths within your district that you can then spread to other parts of your district.

02:41:14.260 --> 02:41:18.622
So again, thank you very much, and Melanie, thanks for organizing the presentation.

02:41:21.483 --> 02:41:22.943
I think we're ready for public comment.

02:41:26.397 --> 02:41:28.700
Will the following individuals please line up at the podium?

02:41:29.401 --> 02:41:38.111
Candace Benji, Martha Alvarez, Alfonso Garza, Angela DeRamos, and Liz Guillen.

02:41:45.558 --> 02:41:51.602
Hello, my name is Candace Benj, and I am here on behalf of Partners for Each and Every Child, a project of the Opportunity Institute.

02:41:52.162 --> 02:42:02.868
I'd like to share recommendations that highlight the need for explicit guidance, especially regarding the complementary and sometimes overlapping roles of the CDE, County Offices of Ed, and the CCEE.

02:42:03.649 --> 02:42:11.234
Establishing clarity will ensure that districts and schools receive responsive, high-quality support and maximizes valuable capacity-building resources.

02:42:12.094 --> 02:42:18.156
We also want to emphasize the importance of strengthening a meaningful approach to engagement that is central to continuous improvement efforts.

02:42:18.337 --> 02:42:28.040
This requires counties, districts, and schools to consider one, representation, two, transparency, three, sustainability, four, collaboration, and five, alignment.

02:42:28.461 --> 02:42:30.241
These are further discussed in our materials.

02:42:31.002 --> 02:42:41.126
As we shared with the CCEE board last month, Partners for is optimistic about the work to strengthen schools and districts to address their most persistent equity challenges, and we look forward to supporting these efforts.

02:42:46.499 --> 02:42:48.381
Good morning, Martha Albers on behalf of AXA.

02:42:48.982 --> 02:42:51.906
We provided some comments in our letter regarding the system of support.

02:42:52.006 --> 02:42:54.189
We're very grateful for this informational item today.

02:42:54.209 --> 02:43:02.800
I just wanted to mention that AXA is continuing to want to partner with the CDE State Board and all other state agencies to communicate the system of support to the field.

02:43:03.520 --> 02:43:14.292
We just met with our members in the last couple of weeks, different groups of AXA, and one of them pointed out that when they Google CDE system of support, MTSS always comes up as sort of the Google searches.

02:43:14.833 --> 02:43:20.559
So, we want to let the field know there's definitely more than just MTSS as opportunities for them to take advantage of.

02:43:21.379 --> 02:43:23.380
We have a lot of ways that we can partner with you.

02:43:23.981 --> 02:43:30.885
Just this week, we released a stakeholder Q&A regarding how to incorporate stakeholder engagement in the system of support.

02:43:31.485 --> 02:43:36.848
On our EDCAL, it's a publication we have every week, so it went out to more than 10,000 of our members.

02:43:37.509 --> 02:43:44.279
We also are willing to do any website, social media, advertisement to really get this information out to the public.

02:43:45.080 --> 02:43:50.709
If anything, communication is really key to ensure that the public really knows what system of support and the dashboard means.

02:43:50.989 --> 02:43:51.290
Thank you.

02:43:56.138 --> 02:43:56.559
Good morning.

02:43:56.979 --> 02:43:58.461
Once again, Alfonso Garagarza.

02:43:59.903 --> 02:44:08.573
I just wanted to say that data is important to us, especially in small rural school districts where access to data can sometimes be difficult in those resources.

02:44:08.593 --> 02:44:12.658
So we very much appreciate free and online resources.

02:44:12.978 --> 02:44:27.475
You know, we do our own internal PD, and I regularly share our financials, our first interim, second interim, our LCAP, our dashboard data with our staff, and we use that to inform our decisions and our practice, as all of us should be doing.

02:44:28.455 --> 02:44:40.278
And one of the metrics that I'm most proud of right now is looking into how students perceive their school, whether or not they're safe, and incorporate that into our school safety plans.

02:44:40.718 --> 02:44:45.699
And so, you know, part of the self-reflection tool in the process was very helpful.

02:44:45.719 --> 02:44:51.520
And I just wanted to say, Jayden, I was very impressed with your presentation this morning.

02:44:52.380 --> 02:45:05.895
Coming down from the mountains last night at, you know, 1230 at night through rain and storms and everything was kind of tough and it was long ago and I'm not going to be around for, you know, our 17 minutes of silence, but all the reports I got is that they were very respectful.

02:45:06.416 --> 02:45:13.423
So know that the students at Butteville Union School District in Siskiyou County stand in solidarity with your leadership.

02:45:13.804 --> 02:45:14.004
Thank you.

02:45:19.281 --> 02:45:27.425
Good morning, Martha Zaragoza-Diaz representing the California Association for Bilingual Education and Californians Together, and it seems that I jumped the gun.

02:45:27.445 --> 02:45:31.587
The comment I realized later when I sat down.

02:45:32.588 --> 02:45:36.549
My comments that I made regarding item one really was meant for this item two.

02:45:36.569 --> 02:45:45.554
We appreciate the data that's in attachment three, and we also want to make sure that the personnel that provide the technical assistance and designated support

02:45:46.074 --> 02:46:13.282
have the expertise and knowledge which regards with regards to services and programs for our unduplicated students and with respect to English learners that they also have the knowledge of the English learner roadmap that was approved by the State Board and what constitutes high quality programs and services for our English learners only in that way can we make sure that the technical assistance or designated differentiated support is appropriate and effective for all students including English learners.

02:46:13.602 --> 02:46:13.882
Thank you.

02:46:19.252 --> 02:46:21.833
Good morning, my name is Ephraim Mercalla from Children Now.

02:46:22.113 --> 02:46:25.815
We continue to appreciate the direction and evolution of the system of support, so we look forward to that.

02:46:26.395 --> 02:46:36.279
Some key points to emphasize from our letter on item two, to reinforce what Member Strauss said, we really look forward to the year two planning of this effort and to learn from the CCE pilots as well.

02:46:36.959 --> 02:46:43.642
We also like to reinforce the idea of a robust vision for level one supports as we continue to evolve and move along, so we look forward to that.

02:46:44.642 --> 02:46:51.186
I also want to applaud the efforts of David Sapp, Melanie Shepp, and Jason Willis on their work for the System of Support Planning Group.

02:46:51.546 --> 02:46:52.827
It has been wonderful to work with them.

02:46:52.907 --> 02:46:59.351
The communication update was tremendous, and I think that is going to send a very clear signal to the LEAs in the field.

02:46:59.411 --> 02:47:03.774
Lastly, we know that local control is central to the California way, and we look forward to supporting that.

02:47:03.914 --> 02:47:04.174
Thank you.

02:47:08.396 --> 02:47:17.803
Hi, Angela DeRamos representing California Teachers Association and I was really pleased to hear the report, previous report of what this looks like on the ground.

02:47:18.584 --> 02:47:19.765
Dos Palos is doing it right.

02:47:19.805 --> 02:47:26.310
I can say I just was there giving a PD because they believe in teacher agency over their professional development and part of the process.

02:47:27.511 --> 02:47:37.180
And on that I want to speak to attachment three, the addition of giving the responsibility for the stakeholders to the superintendent.

02:47:37.981 --> 02:47:41.224
That's an example in Dos Palos of the superintendent doing it right.

02:47:41.685 --> 02:47:44.387
But that's not the case in all schools.

02:47:44.768 --> 02:47:45.929
They have a different purview.

02:47:46.309 --> 02:47:51.174
So I want to emphasize the need to change the language to include all the stakeholders including the teacher,

02:47:51.454 --> 02:47:56.441
It's not just in the what happens after, but in the entire process.

02:47:56.902 --> 02:48:00.868
Teacher agency matters, and if you don't have buy-in from the teachers, we're not going to have anything.

02:48:01.409 --> 02:48:01.629
Thanks.

02:48:06.953 --> 02:48:08.614
Liz Guillen with Public Advocates.

02:48:09.555 --> 02:48:16.300
We're really pleased with the inclusion of Equity Coalition members in the system of support planning group.

02:48:17.201 --> 02:48:23.946
The talking points that came out of those conversations about engagement are really important.

02:48:25.227 --> 02:48:46.147
And we think that they clarify that the reflection and the shifts in direction because of the differentiated assistance process really should be part of the changes or lead to the changes in the LCAP in real time and the community stakeholder engagement needs to be part of that reflection.

02:48:47.648 --> 02:48:58.116
We also think that if an LEA is in the process of differentiated assistance, that information should be communicated and the dashboard we think is a good place for that.

02:48:58.996 --> 02:49:11.005
Data, as we're talking about fiscal transparency, we also know that the transparency of other information really contributes to stronger community engagement.

02:49:11.025 --> 02:49:11.646
Thank you.

02:49:14.312 --> 02:49:18.135
That concludes item 2, which is not an action item.

02:49:18.255 --> 02:49:24.198
And now we're on to item 3, which concerns students with disabilities.

02:49:24.598 --> 02:49:30.362
And we do have approval of a recommendation of CDE.

02:49:30.502 --> 02:49:33.143
So Kristen Wright, welcome back.

02:49:33.723 --> 02:49:36.005
Thank you, President Kurtz, Superintendent, members.

02:49:36.925 --> 02:49:37.526
Thank you, Jeffrey.

02:49:41.277 --> 02:49:49.487
While this is coming up, I just want to mention that this presentation and this item went to the Advisory Commission on Special Education at their last meeting.

02:49:50.248 --> 02:49:59.479
And they have drafted a letter that's coming around to you and that there'll be some in the back as well asking for your support in moving this forward.

02:50:01.801 --> 02:50:09.222
So we are enjoying, in the special education world, a great deal of inclusion at the state level.

02:50:09.722 --> 02:50:19.404
And your commitment to ensuring that students with disabilities are represented across all elements of our system, I believe, is truly being realized.

02:50:19.804 --> 02:50:21.704
And so the trick now is, and then what?

02:50:21.985 --> 02:50:25.845
First you're included, and then we have to do something to engage you.

02:50:26.245 --> 02:50:28.026
So that's sort of where we are.

02:50:28.526 --> 02:50:29.386
And as you know,

02:50:31.127 --> 02:50:47.163
Last month we had an update or you passed a motion to approve our federal indicators, APR, which were indicators 1 through 16, the ones that we talked about, including least restrictive environment and assessment and other things.

02:50:47.704 --> 02:50:52.589
This one is the part two to that, which is our state systemic improvement plan.

02:50:53.730 --> 02:51:06.458
And a few years ago, prior to my time in this role, actually 2013, the Federal Office of Special Education Programs put in place results-driven accountability.

02:51:06.618 --> 02:51:14.043
And essentially, they added this indicator in order for states to work on improvement for students with disabilities around outcomes.

02:51:14.663 --> 02:51:22.889
So, California, in our wisdom, really used this vehicle in a little bit of a different way than some other states.

02:51:23.390 --> 02:51:36.320
Some other states were very narrow in their focus about a specific student group at some specific schools, sometimes even very few schools, where you would do a treatment and then you would see what the result is to measure your outcomes.

02:51:37.526 --> 02:51:47.430
California used this as a vehicle to really push the envelope on including special education and students with disabilities in the array of changes that our state was making.

02:51:47.970 --> 02:51:52.972
So, I would say that at this point, we're seeing the true realization of that.

02:51:53.172 --> 02:51:58.734
We are in phase three, which is our evaluation, implementation and evaluation stage.

02:51:59.574 --> 02:52:19.019
And so if you recall, our theory of action was really that if students with disabilities, which were among our LCFF subgroups, if we made our system more coherent and started including students with disabilities in the greater system, that we would start seeing results because they're in the bigger system.

02:52:19.319 --> 02:52:20.539
They're not in a separate system.

02:52:20.719 --> 02:52:22.820
And as you know from the task force, that was really the cry.

02:52:24.120 --> 02:52:43.763
So, I will have Shiloh come up in a minute and talk about the measurement, but let me just say that currently, as you've heard from all of our presentations, special education and students with disabilities are really included across every single aspect of the work that's going on internally, as well as externally with our partners.

02:52:44.384 --> 02:53:00.757
So we are in the process now of building our resource array and working in partnership with CCEE and others to make sure that we have a coherent array, sort of it's like all these districts are in this differentiated assistance status.

02:53:01.077 --> 02:53:04.480
What do we want to provide as resources at tier one, two, and three?

02:53:05.080 --> 02:53:07.282
So we see that as our goal.

02:53:07.743 --> 02:53:10.505
We have really moved towards a more coaching to compliance

02:53:11.145 --> 02:53:19.372
attitude, and have seen a lot of shifts in our own division in terms of the work that we do and the alignment we are trying to accomplish.

02:53:21.093 --> 02:53:23.055
A few things that we have done I would like to point out.

02:53:23.735 --> 02:53:33.643
We are continuing to refine our TA contracts, meaning that everything we do is in that vein of the system of support that is aligned.

02:53:34.064 --> 02:53:38.627
We are putting a continuous improvement process in all of the activities that we are doing internally.

02:53:40.709 --> 02:53:47.071
to point out that we are working hard to align all those indicators that you saw before represent monitoring activities.

02:53:47.651 --> 02:53:49.672
All those activities happen throughout the year.

02:53:50.172 --> 02:54:02.176
And what we heard from our stakeholders and from LEAs was it would really be helpful if you could give us that information around the same time that we got our dashboard results so we could really use that information to inform our improvement.

02:54:02.736 --> 02:54:06.377
And so our data administrator, who you'll hear from in a minute,

02:54:07.137 --> 02:54:19.348
She's worked hard with our staff at the CDE and our focus monitoring teams to completely realign all of our timelines so that all that data will be A, more current, and B, will be on the timelines of the dashboard.

02:54:21.266 --> 02:54:28.429
So as you know, the system of support, you heard the last presentation, and we've been working closely with our partners within the system of support and are a key member.

02:54:29.010 --> 02:54:38.875
So I won't go into what the system of support is, but I'll say that we have aligned to all the same sort of ideologies so that we're very consistent in our messaging.

02:54:40.296 --> 02:54:52.012
The theory of action has evolved a bit, so the special education alignment to this larger accountability system will result in benefits and increased instructional opportunities.

02:54:52.433 --> 02:54:55.137
I think what we're seeing now is we do have a more

02:54:57.051 --> 02:55:14.746
forward-facing commitment and a statewide uniform commitment around more inclusion of students with disabilities and general ed, which in turn will give access to our students to more of our state standards and more depth of our standards to give them more opportunities like we were talking about for a career in college later.

02:55:16.187 --> 02:55:20.991
And in terms of our own evaluation, that's what you'll be approving today, if you will.

02:55:21.771 --> 02:55:27.555
And that would be that we send this report on to OSEP to let them know the status we're in.

02:55:28.376 --> 02:55:36.001
We've been talking to them all along, reporting that we have seen incredible amounts of change and alignment in our system.

02:55:36.361 --> 02:55:44.727
I think our dashboard is a really good example of our statewide commitment to be very transparent around how each and every one of our students is doing.

02:55:44.867 --> 02:55:45.648
So thank you for that.

02:55:49.241 --> 02:56:00.123
So, we had a few evaluation questions that we answered as part of our initial evaluation, and you'll see them, how is the state system of support impacted by the state systemic improvement plan?

02:56:01.083 --> 02:56:03.984
Really, these just indicate some of the things I just talked about.

02:56:04.344 --> 02:56:17.707
We are cross-cutting with all of these teams, we're doing work with all of these teams, and in turn, my staff in the department is also getting some great training and professional development by working with all of these teams.

02:56:19.372 --> 02:56:26.340
In terms of the next question, how students with disabilities are represented in the larger statewide accountability system, I think that speaks for itself.

02:56:26.860 --> 02:56:27.641
They're front and center.

02:56:28.182 --> 02:56:30.885
And now the question is, what are we going to do about it?

02:56:32.236 --> 02:56:37.598
The third question, how has the Special Ed Division changed its practices to align?

02:56:37.618 --> 02:56:58.085
I am very proud to say that we have gone under a pretty significant restructuring to really hone our practices so that all the activities we do are incredibly relevant to LEAs and their improvement processes, so that we are not just doing things to monitor someone, we are doing things that are relevant to how they are going to work towards improvement.

02:56:59.245 --> 02:57:06.451
Again, our timelines and activities have also been revamped, as well as our TA projects.

02:57:07.052 --> 02:57:15.059
I'm going to have Shiloh come up for a minute and just talk about the measurement really quick, and then I'll be back for just a minute to close out, and then we'll ask for your approval to move this forward.

02:57:17.318 --> 02:57:19.019
Good morning, board members.

02:57:19.179 --> 02:57:19.900
It's still morning.

02:57:20.460 --> 02:57:21.941
Thank you so much for having us here.

02:57:22.281 --> 02:57:30.427
We will try and be brief, and I did not bring you any boring data to show you right before lunch, because I know you might be getting a little bit hangry.

02:57:30.967 --> 02:57:38.412
So I just wanted to talk a little bit about some changes that we made to the ESIP given last year's submission.

02:57:38.572 --> 02:57:42.815
And one of the major changes is how we're looking at the state-identified measurable result.

02:57:43.395 --> 02:57:55.544
If you remember our first iteration of the ESSIP used assessment scores for students in the three LCFF subgroups who were also students with disabilities as sort of the measurement that we would use.

02:57:56.025 --> 02:57:58.046
That was not always our initial choice.

02:57:58.146 --> 02:58:04.191
We wanted to use other types of outcomes like suspension expulsion or least restrictive environment.

02:58:04.591 --> 02:58:05.672
We were informed by the U.S.

02:58:05.692 --> 02:58:09.116
Department of Education that we needed to use a true outcome.

02:58:09.156 --> 02:58:15.003
So we were kind of limited to either graduation assessment scores or post-school outcomes.

02:58:15.083 --> 02:58:22.411
And because about 600 LEAs are elementary school only LEAs, it made sense to use something that we could use for everyone.

02:58:23.695 --> 02:58:30.657
So we looked at the assessment scores for those student groups who were also students with disabilities.

02:58:31.357 --> 02:58:43.120
Last year, we looked at some of the stuff that was happening around the LCAPS and the system of support as it was beginning and realized we really just needed it to be for all students.

02:58:43.160 --> 02:58:51.803
So if we really were talking about all means all, we were looking at all students with disabilities and really moving the needle that way and how the work that we're doing can make that happen.

02:58:52.823 --> 02:59:06.118
So the change that we're implementing this year is when we initially set those targets, we used Kappa data because at the time, CASP data was still in field tests, so we had nothing to benchmark but the Kappa data.

02:59:06.138 --> 02:59:08.361
As you're aware, we don't have the Kappa anymore.

02:59:08.661 --> 02:59:14.605
So we can't continue to hold the data to targets for data that doesn't exist anymore.

02:59:14.906 --> 02:59:16.107
So we changed the targets.

02:59:16.387 --> 02:59:19.269
So now the targets are based on the CASP source.

02:59:19.329 --> 02:59:21.911
So that's what we're submitting to the U.S.

02:59:21.931 --> 02:59:23.012
Department of Education.

02:59:23.172 --> 02:59:26.034
So that's what we're looking for your approval with as well.

02:59:26.794 --> 02:59:34.580
I also did want to sort of note that part of our alignment, which we've been really excited about, has been a couple of things.

02:59:35.261 --> 02:59:42.246
Having students with disabilities represented in the dashboard as a student group, I think, has really helped a lot of the conversations that we have.

02:59:42.487 --> 02:59:45.349
When people look at that data, they can really see that broken out.

02:59:46.049 --> 02:59:55.774
And we're excited that over the next two years that the special education data, this data for students with disabilities will be moved into the CALPADS data system.

02:59:56.174 --> 02:59:58.035
And so that will begin in 2019.

02:59:58.375 --> 03:00:04.638
And that alignment will also help ensure that we have really high quality data when we're making these decisions and moving these plans forward.

03:00:11.798 --> 03:00:14.080
So what are we going to do moving forward?

03:00:14.700 --> 03:00:21.286
So absolutely making sure that we're continued to be engaged in all the activities we currently are.

03:00:21.966 --> 03:00:33.176
And it's a very different place to sit, to not have to create things by yourself, but to be working with a group of people and to be part of the conversation from the build, that's exciting.

03:00:34.236 --> 03:00:46.583
Also, we will be continuing to increase the expertise of our special education division staff so we can be true experts in technical assistance, as well as doing more training in the field.

03:00:46.643 --> 03:00:58.170
Shiloh will be running a series of data boot camps to really work on data quality, especially with the transition coming, so that folks can really understand where their data is coming from in order to inform their practice.

03:00:59.210 --> 03:01:02.171
We will continue our work with cross-division teams.

03:01:02.351 --> 03:01:08.453
As you know, we have realized a great deal of collaboration among all the CDE directors.

03:01:09.054 --> 03:01:19.137
I have not been a CDE director that long, but I do know that there is a deep sense of collaboration and respect among all the division directors and a high level of communication.

03:01:20.580 --> 03:01:38.277
We will also be empowering and continue to engage SELPA, which we believe are a great regional resource, and we'll be working with them as part of some regional hub activities so that they can gain expertise and be special education experts in their regions in a variety of places.

03:01:39.397 --> 03:01:47.962
Also, we'll be selecting LEAs for performance monitoring using the same methodology for graduation assessment and suspension.

03:01:48.082 --> 03:01:56.507
One of the complaints from the LEAs was that we had our own special ed system and targets, and then we had our other system, and what were they supposed to pay attention to?

03:01:57.307 --> 03:01:58.948
Again, we'll be coming back to you with some of that.

03:01:59.809 --> 03:02:00.169
That's it.

03:02:00.489 --> 03:02:02.090
If there's any questions, we're happy to answer them.

03:02:03.268 --> 03:02:05.050
Well, this is a really dramatic change.

03:02:06.992 --> 03:02:07.713
Really something.

03:02:08.534 --> 03:02:09.555
Board member comments.

03:02:12.278 --> 03:02:15.561
Is it, you know, quite impressed with a huge change.

03:02:15.661 --> 03:02:19.826
Board member Sandoval, who represents us on the Advisory Committee for Special Ed.

03:02:20.014 --> 03:02:21.074
Yeah, thank you so much.

03:02:21.114 --> 03:02:35.040
This is informative and concise and very helpful and it just describes how this item is basically a plan for increasing the academic achievement or performance of our students with disabilities within a coherent system of support so it all fits together.

03:02:35.060 --> 03:02:46.305
I also want to applaud the cross divisional work that's happening because it's really making an impact as you said when you're part of the conversation from the build makes all the difference in the world and

03:02:47.125 --> 03:03:00.110
I also want to acknowledge my colleagues on the board for always including students with disabilities in these conversations about accountability and assessment, and it's just a natural part of the work, I think.

03:03:00.850 --> 03:03:06.412
So while we've seen incremental progress in several areas, we still have a lot of way to go.

03:03:07.412 --> 03:03:09.193
So I want to be sure to mention that.

03:03:10.474 --> 03:03:21.160
But this plan moving forward really describes how our statewide system of support in California is going to lead to improved outcomes for our students with disabilities and all students.

03:03:21.781 --> 03:03:26.283
So I also want to acknowledge the letter from the Advisory Commission on Special Education.

03:03:26.323 --> 03:03:27.604
They're in very strong support.

03:03:28.264 --> 03:03:44.953
our approval of this item this plan for submission to the Department of Education so I would move approval of this item for second okay we're gonna have to have public comment so Alfonso Garra Garza

03:03:52.105 --> 03:03:56.410
I hope you don't tire of me too quickly, but I'm making it all count.

03:03:59.214 --> 03:04:07.624
We are encouraged that the CDE Special Education Division is looking to streamline and align to the extent possible

03:04:08.665 --> 03:04:29.746
the activities described in state systemic improvement plan and welcome and support the the greater system alignment as I mentioned previously I did draw a PIR review for participation rate the special ed under the end factor so there are some things there that are concerning and

03:04:31.368 --> 03:04:45.078
We have a student who is needed to be sent to the East Coast for educational services to be provided at the cost of what is 50% of our ending fund balance.

03:04:45.759 --> 03:04:57.227
So if there could be a consideration for a special considerations piece, I would be happy to look into that.

03:04:58.448 --> 03:04:58.668
Thank you.

03:05:05.055 --> 03:05:24.912
I hear that kind of example from rural counties frequently and there is a move from the cities and suburbs into the foothills and into the rural areas and the parents bring their special needs kids with them and so the district all of a sudden has two or three students which take a big chunk of their budget.

03:05:25.532 --> 03:05:30.076
So it's a need I don't have the answer to it but we need to keep looking for that answer.

03:05:31.109 --> 03:05:32.270
Yeah, you can get out of the courtroom.

03:05:32.630 --> 03:05:34.071
Because that just gets more expensive, right?

03:05:34.451 --> 03:05:34.611
Yeah.

03:05:35.432 --> 03:05:41.916
Part of it is that I'm going to look at is, you know, the SELPAs distribute the money in California.

03:05:43.351 --> 03:05:56.856
And nobody really knows where the, how they can, there's no add up of how they calculate that and it's pretty much of a mystery to me as a school finance expert, how the money goes from place to place and what criteria they're using.

03:05:56.916 --> 03:06:02.178
So, at some point it would be interesting to look at, you know, how the self was splitting up the money.

03:06:02.598 --> 03:06:04.459
Maybe they can do nothing but I, in,

03:06:05.439 --> 03:06:13.565
meeting with a small school district's association, there were wildly different policies between SELPAs for small schools.

03:06:13.805 --> 03:06:21.511
There was no uniform state policy, and we don't really have a vehicle to have a uniform state policy.

03:06:22.071 --> 03:06:26.755
So I know there's some bills before the legislature this year to look into this.

03:06:28.296 --> 03:06:32.079
PPIC had a report on this as well.

03:06:32.199 --> 03:06:41.866
So these issues are part of a larger systemic finance issue that has yet really to be overhauled.

03:06:44.508 --> 03:06:47.950
All right, we have a motion, and I think we're then ready for a vote.

03:06:48.030 --> 03:06:48.731
All those in favor?

03:06:50.501 --> 03:06:51.322
All right, that carries.

03:06:51.362 --> 03:06:51.843
Thank you.

03:06:52.503 --> 03:06:54.245
So our lunches are ready.

03:06:55.246 --> 03:07:00.292
And we'll take a small break now and reconvene at 5 after 12.

03:07:04.576 --> 03:07:07.559
OK, the state board will reconvene.

03:07:11.261 --> 03:07:16.243
And we're going to take up item four, which is the federal ESSA plan.

03:07:16.604 --> 03:07:27.429
And before we begin with the presentation by Marguerite, I wanted to paint a little bit of the picture here as I see it.

03:07:28.449 --> 03:07:34.112
First, I want to assure everyone that is aware of the item addendum.

03:07:34.810 --> 03:07:53.636
where we, due to the timing of the posting of the addendum, we have modified the CDE recommendation to delay a vote on some of the crucial items of ESSA until an additional meeting that we will have within a month.

03:07:55.016 --> 03:07:59.538
Board members got a sheet of what we were going to be deciding today.

03:08:00.837 --> 03:08:06.920
and it is called handout and it says handout.

03:08:07.000 --> 03:08:28.392
It says State Board Meeting March 14th and it has the items we will be acting on today, the disproportionate rates of access to educators, Title III Part Sub A, English Language Acquisition and Language Enhancement, Entrance and Exit procedures,

03:08:29.421 --> 03:08:34.624
and issues concerning the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act.

03:08:36.305 --> 03:08:44.429
Held over then are most of the meatier items, status and change, indicator-specific issues,

03:08:45.467 --> 03:08:55.190
measurements of interim progress, weighting of indicators, school identification, exit criteria, and the size of numbers.

03:08:56.190 --> 03:08:58.931
So that will encompass the meeting today.

03:08:59.411 --> 03:09:06.693
The additional meeting, we have been negotiating

03:09:10.374 --> 03:09:11.335
with the U.S.

03:09:11.495 --> 03:09:21.799
Department of Education and really appreciate their response in a professional and collaborative and open way to try and get the yes in these issues.

03:09:23.220 --> 03:09:37.886
We have striven at every turn to align the federal ESSA with the state plan and our LCFF and other state policies and we believe we have accomplished that.

03:09:39.549 --> 03:09:50.272
In that regard, our staff and the CDE spent over five hours one day in discussion with the U.S.

03:09:50.332 --> 03:09:53.313
Department, and we've had several discussions after that.

03:09:54.333 --> 03:10:05.256
I think we have, as Margarita mentioned, I think we have gotten to the point where we

03:10:06.380 --> 03:10:09.505
an agreement with the U.S.

03:10:09.545 --> 03:10:16.435
Department, which is necessary to have an approved plan for the ESSA by the Department of Education.

03:10:16.535 --> 03:10:18.478
So we've come a long way.

03:10:18.538 --> 03:10:19.860
We ran out of time.

03:10:21.031 --> 03:10:26.815
to get this posted early because of the discussions that were still going on.

03:10:26.875 --> 03:10:32.439
It takes a while to go back and forth and get sign-off from U.S.

03:10:32.459 --> 03:10:35.381
Department officials and NRFs to rewrite it.

03:10:36.882 --> 03:10:44.228
So it became clear from the start that the U.S.

03:10:44.608 --> 03:10:45.649
Education Department

03:10:46.289 --> 03:10:54.414
has a narrower reading of the law than we have had in our prior deliberations and discussions.

03:10:55.995 --> 03:11:07.163
And they had used these definitions to approve other state plans and we were not open to revisiting what they saw as the correct legal interpretation.

03:11:08.615 --> 03:11:09.796
The U.S.

03:11:09.836 --> 03:11:13.378
Department of Education is sticking very close to the statute.

03:11:14.999 --> 03:11:26.826
As you may recall, the Congress killed the proposed regulations of the Obama administration, so they are really basing, at the Washington level, everything pretty much on the statute.

03:11:28.768 --> 03:11:43.616
I think that, as you'll see if you read what was posted yesterday, state priorities and policy directions lead the plan that has been negotiated with them.

03:11:43.636 --> 03:11:51.240
The multiple measures dashboard and others are really crucial and preserved.

03:11:52.268 --> 03:11:59.230
We believe we can create a coherent system that avoids the complexities of separate state and federal accountability structures.

03:12:00.771 --> 03:12:13.195
That being said, we still have the opportunity to pursue waivers during this process, and the burden of proof is much changed through ESSA on the

03:12:14.215 --> 03:12:15.175
The U.S.

03:12:15.195 --> 03:12:20.037
Department of Education showing reasons why they can't approve your waivers.

03:12:20.537 --> 03:12:23.818
Under the older version of Congress, it was the other way around.

03:12:23.878 --> 03:12:28.360
The burden of proof was on the state proposing the waivers.

03:12:29.220 --> 03:12:35.562
So we can use this added meeting to talk about all the issues.

03:12:36.226 --> 03:12:41.769
We can talk about the implementation implications of what has been negotiated.

03:12:42.710 --> 03:12:51.595
We can talk about waivers and what we should be waiving, asking to waive at that time as well, as well as waivers in the future.

03:12:52.555 --> 03:12:57.058
So let's have the CDE complete their presentation.

03:12:58.485 --> 03:13:06.274
and then we'll use our procedure of asking clarifying questions to CDE and then we will move on to public comment.

03:13:06.895 --> 03:13:12.622
So let's begin and Marguerite will start with a formal presentation by the department.

03:13:14.301 --> 03:13:17.663
Good afternoon, President Kirst, Superintendent Torlakson, and members of the board.

03:13:17.683 --> 03:13:22.506
I'm Marguerite Reese, CDE's Federal Policy Liaison in the Government Affairs Division.

03:13:23.386 --> 03:13:36.773
As President Kirst just indicated in his opening remarks, I will provide information related to item four, update on the development of the California State Plan for the Every Student Succeeds Act, approval of the revisions to the state plan for resubmission to the U.S.

03:13:36.793 --> 03:13:37.774
Department of Education.

03:13:39.355 --> 03:13:52.922
As the board takes an additional look at California's ESSA Consolidated State Plan, I will spend just a few moments reiterating the foundational elements of the Every Student Succeeds Act, the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, or ESEA.

03:13:52.942 --> 03:13:58.625
ESSA maintains the original purpose of ESEA, equal opportunity for all students.

03:13:59.125 --> 03:14:04.668
This act ensures that disadvantaged and high-need students receive the same educational opportunities as their peers.

03:14:06.024 --> 03:14:10.647
A hallmark of the 2015 reauthorization is the increased emphasis on local control.

03:14:11.267 --> 03:14:15.749
ESSA grants much more authority to states than under its predecessor, No Child Left Behind.

03:14:17.650 --> 03:14:22.473
ESSA funds comprise roughly 3% of California's education budget.

03:14:23.113 --> 03:14:30.017
California's total kindergarten through 12th grade funding for the 2017-18 year and California Budget Act is $92.5 billion.

03:14:31.983 --> 03:14:38.851
State funds are $55.4 billion, local funds are $29 billion, and federal funds are $8.1 billion.

03:14:38.871 --> 03:14:43.957
And California's ESSA allocation is a portion of that federal $8.1 billion, approximately $2.8 billion.

03:14:49.062 --> 03:14:54.924
In the years prior to the reauthorization of ESEA, California embarked on an overhaul of its public education system.

03:14:55.204 --> 03:15:10.889
New standards, frameworks, and instructional materials were developed and adopted, a corresponding assessment system was implemented, and California's new accountability and continuous improvement system rooted in the local control funding formula and local control accountability plans was rolled out across the state.

03:15:12.256 --> 03:15:21.492
In many ways, the principles of the Every Student Succeeds Act complement California's efforts to increase our resources and attention on continuous improvement for all student groups.

03:15:23.507 --> 03:15:33.710
California continues to be committed to ensuring the ESSA Consolidated State Plan simultaneously meets the federal requirements while allowing for the full implementation of the Local Control Funding Formula.

03:15:34.610 --> 03:15:47.454
The State Plan submitted in September 2017, January 2018, and the proposed revisions provided for the Board's consideration today each outline the steps taken to develop an integrated state, federal, and local accountability system.

03:15:48.454 --> 03:15:58.762
As previously indicated, the work to integrate the revised federal requirements are grounded in the principles of LCFF, which empowers local communities to make local decisions to address local needs.

03:15:59.482 --> 03:16:04.506
Throughout the plan development process, the board and the majority of stakeholders have been in agreement on that point.

03:16:04.986 --> 03:16:09.590
And letters to the board for this item today reiterated this foundational belief.

03:16:11.872 --> 03:16:22.300
Following the action taken to approve the ESSA Consolidated State Plan at the September 2017 State Board of Education meeting, California submitted its application on the 15th of September of last year.

03:16:23.440 --> 03:16:31.526
Peer reviews took place in late October and early November for just three sections, Title I, Title III, and McKinney-Vento Assistance for Homeless Youth.

03:16:32.307 --> 03:16:33.688
From the date of submission, the U.S.

03:16:33.728 --> 03:16:35.649
Department of Education had 120 days to review state's plans.

03:16:39.761 --> 03:16:47.866
In late December 2017, staff from the State Board of Education and the California Department of Education participated in a conference call with staff from the U.S.

03:16:47.906 --> 03:16:52.749
Department of Education, or ED, in order to review ED's interim feedback letter.

03:16:53.749 --> 03:17:03.936
Prior to the January State Board meeting, the CD hosted a public in-person and webinar meeting related to the proposed revisions to the state plan from the accountability sections on January 9th.

03:17:04.796 --> 03:17:06.898
Staff walked through the areas of feedback from the U.S.

03:17:06.918 --> 03:17:14.165
Department of Education and described the proposed modifications to California State Plan for approximately 100 meeting participants.

03:17:16.967 --> 03:17:25.315
During the January State Board meeting, CDE staff presented to the State Board a revised version of the State Plan based on the content of the Interim Feedback Letter from ED.

03:17:26.596 --> 03:17:46.441
The SBE discussed and approved the revised ESSA state plan for submission to ED with the revision to replace the proposal related to the identification of the lowest performing schools with revised language indicating that the State Board would consider a proposed state plan supplement at its March 2018 meeting for submission to ED that further described the approach.

03:17:47.918 --> 03:17:53.019
As you will recall, states were permitted to submit their ESSA state plans in either April or September of last year.

03:17:53.039 --> 03:17:57.880
As of today, the Secretary of Education has approved 35 state plans.

03:17:57.900 --> 03:18:05.762
16 states and the District of Columbia submitted their plans as part of the April submission window, and all but one of those states, Colorado, has been approved.

03:18:06.682 --> 03:18:09.623
Another 34 states turned in their plans this fall.

03:18:10.243 --> 03:18:14.044
Thus far, 13 of the September states and territories have been approved.

03:18:15.177 --> 03:18:18.902
It is worth noting that no states were immediately approved upon submission.

03:18:19.582 --> 03:18:21.324
All received at least one round of feedback.

03:18:21.705 --> 03:18:29.294
California's approach is somewhat different than those recently approved September submission states and that the state board weighs in on each draft of the state plan.

03:18:32.008 --> 03:18:40.710
Throughout the state plan development process, the State Board and CDE have worked together on what has been a highly collaborative development process shared by our two agencies.

03:18:41.670 --> 03:18:57.654
Following the January State Board meeting, the SBE and CDE staff came together and worked in partnership to find ways to seek final plan approval that continued to honor the tenets of LCFF while also moving expeditiously in order to shift California's focus towards implementation.

03:18:58.914 --> 03:19:13.412
Through conversations both with approved states and pending states, we learned that most had gone through multiple rounds of back and forth with ED in order to tentatively agree on a provable language in their respective state plans before providing a formal resubmission.

03:19:14.332 --> 03:19:18.836
With this information in hand, staff members from the State Board and CDE reached out to the U.S.

03:19:18.856 --> 03:19:22.820
Department of Education, and a small delegation traveled to Washington, D.C.

03:19:22.880 --> 03:19:27.625
in late February to discuss the outstanding areas of feedback from the U.S.

03:19:27.665 --> 03:19:32.169
Department of Education related to the January resubmission version of the state plan.

03:19:32.910 --> 03:19:51.284
The California team included Karen Staff-Walters, Executive Director of the State Board, David Sapp, Deputy Policy Director and Assistant Legal Counsel, State Board, Glenn Price, Chief Deputy, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, CDE, and Cindy Kazanas, Director, Analysis, Measurement, and Accountability Reporting Division, CDE.

03:19:52.495 --> 03:19:56.516
Staff met with Jason Botel, who has one of the longest titles I've ever come across.

03:19:56.956 --> 03:20:12.641
Principal, Deputy, Assistant Secretary delegated the authority to perform the functions and duties of the Assistant Secretary of Elementary and Secondary Education, as well as other senior officials from the US Department of Education, for approximately six hours during their in-person meeting and through many

03:20:15.063 --> 03:20:19.426
You know, I've had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Botel, but have not received a business card.

03:20:19.486 --> 03:20:21.247
So I'm sure he'd be happy to share one.

03:20:22.588 --> 03:20:23.369
I'll find out for you.

03:20:25.515 --> 03:20:33.919
Let's see, so they met together for approximately six hours and continued conversations for the days and weeks leading up, frankly, just until yesterday.

03:20:35.500 --> 03:20:38.221
Over the course of multiple conversations, officials from the U.S.

03:20:38.241 --> 03:20:50.247
Department of Education indicated they were willing to explore innovative approaches for the implementation of ESSA related to the remaining areas of concern, but only within their arguably narrow reading of the federal statute.

03:20:51.187 --> 03:21:01.239
Staff from the federal and state agencies worked together for weeks and discussed potential language that would both meet Ed's interpretation of federal statute and continue to align with the California way.

03:21:02.622 --> 03:21:04.643
Based on the conversations with staff from the U.S.

03:21:04.683 --> 03:21:10.505
Department of Education over the last several weeks, the CDE proposes to make further revisions to the State Plan.

03:21:11.165 --> 03:21:23.210
The proposed revisions maintain the core principles of California's approach to accountability and continuous improvement, which is based in the LCFF and reflects the extensive stakeholder input received over the last several years.

03:21:24.290 --> 03:21:26.052
Many of the changes are technical in nature.

03:21:26.512 --> 03:21:33.439
However, some substantive changes are necessary to address ED's interpretation of several ESSA provisions.

03:21:34.379 --> 03:21:40.465
The proposed language in the item reflects the changes the CD believes need to be made in order to have an approvable plan.

03:21:41.186 --> 03:21:48.673
Based on our conversations with ED staff, the CD is confident that if the Board ultimately adopts these revisions, the Secretary will approve the plan.

03:21:50.154 --> 03:21:58.556
And in order to complete the review of the timeline, on March 2nd, 2018, the State Board published the board item related to the proposed revisions for your meeting today.

03:21:59.176 --> 03:22:11.979
Although both the State Board and CDE shared the goal of posting a complete state plan inclusive of all of the revised sections, ongoing conversations with ED prevented us from publishing a full proposed and revised state plan until earlier this week.

03:22:13.294 --> 03:22:28.125
In order to provide as much information to the public as possible prior to today's board meeting, the CDE hosted an ESSA accountability stakeholder meeting on March 7th to review the proposed changes to the state plan, and nearly 70 participants participated in that webinar.

03:22:30.168 --> 03:22:40.379
Given the State Board and CDE's desire to have a transparent and open plan development process with stakeholders and the public, the CDE will present three sections for the Board's consideration today.

03:22:41.139 --> 03:22:43.822
The formal recommendation will follow on subsequent slides.

03:22:44.803 --> 03:22:49.968
The remaining items, inclusive of the Title I accountability sections, Section A of the State Plan Template,

03:22:50.729 --> 03:22:55.130
will be presented to the board at an upcoming state board of education additional meeting.

03:22:55.870 --> 03:23:07.132
The additional meeting will take place within the next month and this extra time will allow for additional dialogue and will honor the requests for multiple stakeholder organizations to postpone the full board discussion on this item.

03:23:07.952 --> 03:23:15.414
This extra time will also permit staff to collect questions received feedback from the comments letters and use the information to inform

03:23:15.874 --> 03:23:18.716
the presentation of the additional meeting to the State Board.

03:23:19.777 --> 03:23:25.801
The CD also plans to host an ESSA stakeholder webinar about one week prior to the additional State Board meeting.

03:23:28.083 --> 03:23:29.764
So here is your formal recommendation.

03:23:30.664 --> 03:23:35.027
The CD recommends that the State Board approve the revisions to sections A.5, E.1,

03:23:37.742 --> 03:23:49.550
and I.7G of the State Plan pending the State Board of Education Executive Director approval of final revisions requested by the State Board of Education and correction of any typographical errors.

03:23:50.331 --> 03:23:58.156
The CDE further recommends that the State Board consider further proposed revisions to Section A of the State Plan at an additional meeting.

03:24:00.290 --> 03:24:08.561
Provided for the board today, as well as for the public, is a handout articulating the sections of the state plan the board will consider over the course of two meetings.

03:24:09.162 --> 03:24:15.570
The left column of this slide, as well as the handout, refer to those items that the board will discuss and potentially take action on today.

03:24:16.491 --> 03:24:21.875
And the information on the right column references those items for consideration at an upcoming additional meeting.

03:24:22.495 --> 03:24:25.417
The handout also cross-references item numbers from the U.S.

03:24:25.437 --> 03:24:31.301
Department of Education's February 14 resubmission elements found in attachment 3 of your board item.

03:24:32.161 --> 03:24:54.469
So to reiterate, today the board will consider disproportionate rates of access to educators, Title III, Part A, Subpart 1, English Language Acquisition and Language Enhancement, Entrance and Exit Procedures, and finally, Title VII, Subtitle B, Education for Homeless Children and Youth Program, McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance from Counselors.

03:24:55.109 --> 03:25:01.031
And during the additional meeting, the board will consider the sections related to Title I, Accountability, Status and Long

03:25:01.631 --> 03:25:27.297
excuse me, status and change, which are inclusive of long-term goals and indicators, and also include the academic achievement, graduation rate, English language proficiency, and other academic and school quality or success indicators, indicator-specific issues, which include the college, career, and English language proficiency indicators, measurements of interim progress, weighing of indicators, school identification, exit criteria, and end size.

03:25:29.158 --> 03:25:32.581
There are three attachments and two addenda related to this item today.

03:25:33.161 --> 03:25:39.185
Attachments one and two provide identical content, but are displayed for the board using two different formats.

03:25:39.786 --> 03:25:52.555
State and federal agencies must comply with section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which in part requires documents and other public resources provided by public agencies to be accessible for individuals with disabilities.

03:25:53.516 --> 03:25:59.400
Attachment 1 displays the proposed revisions to California's ESSA State Plan in a format compliant with Section 508.

03:26:00.561 --> 03:26:05.444
Double brackets indicating the modifications delineate additions, changes, and deletions.

03:26:07.005 --> 03:26:14.370
Again, Attachment 2 includes the proposed revisions to California's ESSA State Plan displayed using Microsoft Word Track Changes formatting.

03:26:14.891 --> 03:26:18.053
The forwarding in Attachment 2 is the method in which the U.S.

03:26:18.093 --> 03:26:22.056
Department of Education has requested that revisions to State Plans be resubmitted.

03:26:23.345 --> 03:26:30.909
Attachment 3 includes a matrix of ED's resubmission elements cross-referenced with the page numbers from California's ESSA State Plans.

03:26:31.670 --> 03:26:34.551
The first column numbers the areas of feedback from ED.

03:26:34.771 --> 03:26:37.253
The second column lists the ESSA State Plan section.

03:26:38.233 --> 03:26:41.735
The third column includes the direct feedback from ED's February 14, 2018

03:26:43.536 --> 03:26:55.023
resubmission elements, the fourth column displays the page numbers from Attachment 1, the 508 version, and the final column shows the cross-reference page numbers from Attachment 2, the Track Changes version.

03:26:55.043 --> 03:27:08.931
Addendum 1 includes proposed revisions to the sections of the State Plan related to the weighing of indicators and school identification, as well as proposed revisions to two sections that were inadvertently excluded from Attachments 1 and 2.

03:27:12.518 --> 03:27:23.654
The second addendum provides additional data tables that will be submitted in the proposed revised state plan, including the baseline data for the grade 11 academic indicator and the English learner progress indicator.

03:27:25.455 --> 03:27:27.556
So finally, we're getting to the meat of the item.

03:27:28.796 --> 03:27:32.438
The following slide highlights the areas of feedback identified by the U.S.

03:27:32.458 --> 03:27:35.920
Department of Education that are included in today's revised board item.

03:27:36.580 --> 03:27:41.242
All other areas of feedback will be incorporated into staff presentations at the additional meeting.

03:27:42.597 --> 03:27:50.400
So disproportionate rates of access to educators, which is as a state plan section A5 and is included in attachment three as number 19.

03:27:51.460 --> 03:28:11.528
The CDE recommends that the state plan be updated to include a number of steps outlined in section 8.5 to ensure that low income and minority children enrolled in schools assisted under title one part A are not served at disproportionate rates by ineffective out of field or inexperienced teachers beyond the evaluation and public reporting of equity gaps.

03:28:12.088 --> 03:28:35.190
The statutory provision requiring local educational agencies, or LEAs, to submit an annual plan to the state education agency that describes how it will identify and address any disparities that result in low-income students and minority students being taught at higher rates than other students by ineffective, inexperienced, or out-of-field teachers will be required to be completed in the revised LCAP amendment beginning in the 2018-19 school year.

03:28:37.572 --> 03:28:44.901
If the LEA's response is insufficient, California will return the LCAP addendum with suggestions for ways to sustain the LEA's response.

03:28:45.722 --> 03:28:53.432
Further, this section will be updated to act able to provide the most recent year of analyzed teacher data disaggregated by Title I schools.

03:28:55.879 --> 03:29:02.328
Title 3, Part A, Subpart 1, English Language Acquisition and Language Enhancement Entrance and Exit Procedures.

03:29:02.709 --> 03:29:07.435
This is ESSA State Plan Section E1 and is included as Item Number 22 in Attachment 3.

03:29:10.029 --> 03:29:36.728
The CD suggests that this section of the state plan be supplemented to add three additional details of the timeline to be undertaken to standardize English learner entrance and exit criteria for English learners in California, including one, the adoption by the State Board of Education of a new English language proficiency assessment for California reclassification criteria, two, the development of the standardized language observation tool and parent involvement protocol, and three,

03:29:37.649 --> 03:29:43.115
work with the state legislature to begin to change the reclassification criteria in California statute.

03:29:44.416 --> 03:29:53.947
Finally, Title VII, Subtitle B, Education for Homeless Children and Youth Program, McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, Assistance from Counselors, S.S.

03:29:53.987 --> 03:29:55.568
State Plan Section 1.7G, and Number 24 of Attachment 3.

03:30:00.393 --> 03:30:01.754
Based on the feedback from the U.S.

03:30:01.774 --> 03:30:14.697
Department of Education, the CD suggests that this revised state plan clarify and describe how homeless youths will receive specific assistance from counselors to advise such youths and prepare and improve the readiness of homeless youth for college.

03:30:17.418 --> 03:30:18.798
We're back at the recommendation.

03:30:19.378 --> 03:30:26.000
I'm happy to read it for you again, but I'll leave it up as a slide for your consideration while I turn it back over to President Kirst.

03:30:27.264 --> 03:30:28.364
Thank you.

03:30:29.325 --> 03:30:33.286
So this is a time for technical questions.

03:30:33.926 --> 03:30:38.267
We have more time on our agenda than I think is indicated.

03:30:38.287 --> 03:30:42.188
Viewing the audience, we're not going to have a tremendous number of speakers.

03:30:43.368 --> 03:30:54.011
So this is a chance for the board to pursue some of the understandings in advance of the additional meeting as well as to what has happened here and what has transpired.

03:30:56.032 --> 03:31:11.782
I've seen some articles that say that we were unable to preserve the single line system, and I don't think the people saying that understand how this is going to work and all the details that are related to that.

03:31:11.862 --> 03:31:21.028
We can continue to provide some information for Federal purposes, but still provide the same information we always were.

03:31:21.848 --> 03:31:24.951
using for our dashboard and other things of that sort.

03:31:25.011 --> 03:31:30.275
So, it's not entirely an either-or situation.

03:31:30.395 --> 03:31:42.904
So, with that, let me open it up for board questions and I think the floor is open for anything you want to ask in addition to the items we have for approval today.

03:31:44.846 --> 03:31:47.708
So, Board Member Burr and then Board Member LaCon.

03:31:48.670 --> 03:31:57.898
So I have really kind of a process question, because as I understand it, the pieces attached to accountability, we want to defer to the additional meeting, right?

03:31:58.199 --> 03:31:58.399
Okay.

03:31:59.039 --> 03:32:08.548
So at least in conversations that we had initially, there was discussion, and this may be a question actually for Carrick, but maybe you can answer it, Marguerite.

03:32:09.208 --> 03:32:26.720
about, it seemed to me there was the understanding from the Federal Department of Education that we had to have an approved plan before we could submit a waiver, which seems opposite of what we've done in the past where we asked for waivers from statute.

03:32:27.240 --> 03:32:31.103
And it won't surprise anybody here, there are several provisions that I would like to have waived.

03:32:32.004 --> 03:32:34.005
So I just want to understand that process.

03:32:34.105 --> 03:32:35.767
What is that accurate?

03:32:35.847 --> 03:32:41.652
Is that legally the process that we have to have an approved plan before we can submit a waiver?

03:32:41.672 --> 03:32:46.836
And if so, on what basis given how we've acted in the past?

03:32:48.151 --> 03:32:51.212
Sure, so I'll do my best to answer and of course my colleagues can join me.

03:32:52.412 --> 03:32:54.353
Frankly, in the in-person meeting with the U.S.

03:32:54.373 --> 03:32:59.254
Department of Education, I think it's fair to characterize that the first hour was a little rocky.

03:32:59.594 --> 03:33:06.456
And so, both state board and CDE staff at that point said, okay, well then,

03:33:07.356 --> 03:33:11.597
maybe we can't come to agreement, then California will submit waivers on these subjects.

03:33:11.957 --> 03:33:14.618
And the State Board said, or excuse me, not the State Board, the U.S.

03:33:14.638 --> 03:33:24.460
Department of Education said, wait, hold on, we will not even entertain conversations related to waivers until California has submitted an approvable plan.

03:33:24.941 --> 03:33:34.163
Which, in another way to say, is California needs to modify your proposals in order, in their eyes, to be fully compliant with federal statute

03:33:34.523 --> 03:33:39.907
And then we can talk about doing things that may be different through a waiver.

03:33:40.848 --> 03:33:42.689
So my question is, is that legal?

03:33:43.230 --> 03:33:57.781
I can say, especially if you're having a very difficult conversation and in a fit of pique, say, we're only going to operate this way, that's different than what the actual legal process is for asking for a waiver.

03:33:59.039 --> 03:34:03.463
Good afternoon, David Sapp, Deputy Policy Director and Assistant Legal Counsel for the State Board of Education.

03:34:03.543 --> 03:34:07.646
Since that's a legal question, as counsel, I will do my best to try to address it.

03:34:08.186 --> 03:34:19.195
So, I'll try to quickly summarize what the SS statute itself says, and focus there, and then sort of can answer any follow-up questions.

03:34:19.796 --> 03:34:26.221
There are a couple of provisions in the federal law that specifically address the state plan approval process.

03:34:27.041 --> 03:34:33.505
And so the first of those has to do with the actual provision that requires states to submit state plans.

03:34:34.225 --> 03:34:37.387
That's ESSA section 1111 for those following along at home.

03:34:38.027 --> 03:34:44.470
But the first part of that section talks about the requirement to submit plans.

03:34:44.911 --> 03:34:52.695
And specifically it says that states who desire to receive a grant under, this is title one, must submit a plan for approval.

03:34:53.916 --> 03:35:06.905
It specifically grants the secretary authority, actually requires the secretary to approve the plan and grants the secretary authority to disapprove plans if she determines that the state plan fails to meet the requirements of the section.

03:35:08.045 --> 03:35:14.470
So it's an explicit sort of provision that to approve a plan she needs to determine that it doesn't meet the requirements.

03:35:15.510 --> 03:35:27.074
The second part of that section that's relevant here is the statute also expressly authorizes the Secretary to withhold state funds if the state fails to meet any of the requirements of this section.

03:35:27.575 --> 03:35:33.857
So that's the question about being able to withhold funds if the state plan essentially doesn't meet the requirements of the statute.

03:35:34.517 --> 03:35:39.080
There's a second or separate section of the federal law.

03:35:39.520 --> 03:35:46.444
It's much later in the statute that actually expressly describes the procedures for state plan approval.

03:35:46.564 --> 03:35:48.905
That's SS section 8014.

03:35:49.906 --> 03:35:53.588
And that lays out essentially the standard that the secretary applies.

03:35:54.228 --> 03:36:08.364
And the language there in reviewing the plans on the front end is that the plan is not in compliance in whole or in part with the relevant provisions of the section that I was just discussing, which lays out the requirements of state plans.

03:36:09.145 --> 03:36:16.046
And if the secretary finds or disapproves a plan based on that standard, there's a hearing process that's laid out in statute.

03:36:16.086 --> 03:36:17.827
It has specific timelines.

03:36:17.847 --> 03:36:27.949
The secretary has to notify states in writing, has to hold a hearing, but ultimately at the end of that process, the secretary still determines whether the plan is approvable and it's the same standard.

03:36:28.649 --> 03:36:32.570
It is whether it meets the requirements of the relevant statutory provision under the state plan.

03:36:33.559 --> 03:36:40.103
So those two provisions together have to do with whether the plan meets the legal requirements of the statute.

03:36:40.463 --> 03:36:45.946
There's a separate statute that addresses the waiver authority under the federal law.

03:36:46.447 --> 03:36:50.229
And I believe, Member Burr, that's the question that you were asking.

03:36:50.769 --> 03:36:56.533
And that authority specifically authorizes waivers of statutory or regulatory requirements.

03:36:56.673 --> 03:36:58.334
That's section 8401 of ESSA.

03:37:01.035 --> 03:37:06.259
So, it applies specifically to statute or to regulations that are under the federal law.

03:37:06.880 --> 03:37:12.524
The issue is that the timeline for waiver requests is actually more extended.

03:37:13.325 --> 03:37:22.632
Essentially, the secretary could not approve the plan unless the submitted plan meets their interpretation of what the state plan law requires.

03:37:24.033 --> 03:37:35.582
And so the question of whether we can have an approved plan, unless the plan meets the specific reading of the statute that they're applying in the review of the plan, I believe my understanding of the discussion with the U.S.

03:37:35.643 --> 03:37:43.269
Department of Education is they won't approve a state plan if it is contingent upon receiving a waiver.

03:37:44.270 --> 03:37:50.435
So essentially the plan has to be submitted and address their reading of the statute in order to be approved.

03:37:52.264 --> 03:38:06.996
because this is like a chicken and egg conversation to me, that what if we say initially, and I'm just speaking on my behalf obviously, that we want to ask for a waiver from a statute before we ever submit a plan?

03:38:07.537 --> 03:38:09.078
Don't they have to act on the waiver?

03:38:12.288 --> 03:38:30.422
The overall, I mean, if I heard what you said about general waiver authority, and I don't want to put you on the spot here, Dave, but I do think that when we get ready prior to having this additional meeting or whatever we're calling it, we need to know what our options are and what the timeline is for those options.

03:38:31.502 --> 03:38:50.488
And I also think we also, and I appreciate Marguerite saying this, but I would really call people's attention to the fiscal analysis of this report, of this item, because again, we're talking about an overall investment of state and federal money that is 10 times more than what the feds are doing.

03:38:51.208 --> 03:38:58.149
And if we're ever in a tail-wagging-the-dog situation, we have been there from the get-go on this ESSA thing.

03:38:58.629 --> 03:39:00.870
And now we're getting down to brass tacks.

03:39:02.150 --> 03:39:18.173
So I just think we need to know what all of the options are in the event we want to go in a direction that says, no, we think this needs to happen in order to preserve our state accountability system as we've been building it for the last three or four years.

03:39:19.501 --> 03:39:27.346
I'll do my best to try to address quickly, and I think we can do further analysis and try to lay it out more thoroughly in advance of the next meeting.

03:39:28.207 --> 03:39:41.196
But I think ultimately, it's more a question of, it doesn't make a practical difference, candidly, because in order to approve the plan, the plan needs to meet the statutory requirements.

03:39:41.636 --> 03:39:45.522
So, holding off on submission of the plan until a waiver is submitted and ruled upon.

03:39:45.923 --> 03:39:56.698
If the waiver is denied, it would still be in the same place as if submitted an improvable plan and then pursued a waiver which was subsequently denied, except we would have an approved state plan and the receipt of funds would be guaranteed.

03:39:57.299 --> 03:40:07.622
So I think the short answer to the question is ultimately the standard for review and approval is the same for the initial submission of the state plan and to the extent there's a hearing.

03:40:08.183 --> 03:40:09.763
The same is true for the waiver authority.

03:40:10.203 --> 03:40:12.804
It has the same standard for the initial review.

03:40:12.824 --> 03:40:13.985
There is a right to a hearing.

03:40:14.005 --> 03:40:24.108
It's actually a longer, the period of time from start to finish is a little bit longer than it would be for plan approval, but it's ultimately the same standard and ultimately from the secretary's discretion under both.

03:40:24.608 --> 03:40:32.615
but I think that's something that we can, you know, take back and try to lay out a little more concisely in advance of the next meeting.

03:40:33.475 --> 03:40:51.070
Okay, while you're doing that analysis, Mr. Sapp, I'd like you to, what are the, as I understand the waiver statute part of ESSA, the Secretary must respond in a certain amount of time

03:40:52.119 --> 03:41:06.970
So I'm trying to understand the downside of, you know, submitting a waiver a month later after the plan or to, you know, we're going to, we're going to meet approximately sometime in April.

03:41:07.950 --> 03:41:10.853
So the state plan would go in, in April.

03:41:12.532 --> 03:41:23.961
we have a board meeting again in May, we might be able to get approval of the submittal we did in April by our board meeting.

03:41:24.481 --> 03:41:26.242
We could submit the waiver then.

03:41:26.262 --> 03:41:37.451
So I want you in your analysis to consider whether this is, you know, if we have to go with submitting the plan and then the waiver,

03:41:38.206 --> 03:41:45.134
given that we're having an additional meeting, what, you know, what, how quickly could the turnaround happen?

03:41:45.654 --> 03:41:48.077
How quickly must the Secretary respond?

03:41:48.157 --> 03:41:50.740
I remember she has a, you know, there's a period of time.

03:41:50.760 --> 03:41:55.825
It's a, the Secretary has 120 days to respond to a waiver request.

03:41:56.045 --> 03:41:58.588
And what would that deadline then do to our,

03:41:59.660 --> 03:42:03.902
anything we would possibly take action on within that 120 days.

03:42:03.982 --> 03:42:14.386
I'm trying to see if there's any real problem here with, of acting since we're, you know, we are doing an additional meeting and so on.

03:42:14.426 --> 03:42:19.028
So if you could include that in your analysis, I would find that useful.

03:42:21.069 --> 03:42:23.349
Okay, Board Member Ortiz-Lacombe.

03:42:23.510 --> 03:42:24.490
State Superintendent wants to...

03:42:27.034 --> 03:42:38.960
I was just going to say in addition to the analysis you just asked for, Mr. President, my staff could work with the board staff and just how much money, how much federal money is at risk under any of these scenarios and what's the time flow of the dollars?

03:42:39.380 --> 03:42:46.183
Can they turn the faucet off at a certain point if certain steps haven't been followed that they think must be followed?

03:42:46.644 --> 03:42:51.646
And if so, what consequence is that to cash flow to the programs and the students supported?

03:42:55.535 --> 03:43:00.699
OK, I had Ortiz-Lacombe.

03:43:01.159 --> 03:43:01.700
Oh, OK.

03:43:02.360 --> 03:43:04.382
OK, Board Member Crocker.

03:43:06.761 --> 03:43:08.942
Thank you very much, Board Member Lee Cohn.

03:43:10.083 --> 03:43:30.136
David, I noticed that in giving the explanation about the sections in ESSA concerning the approval of the plan, I also have read that statute and I know that there are 15 specific statements concerning the waiver process on limiting the Secretary's authority and behavior

03:43:30.556 --> 03:43:40.522
in approving waivers and one of those statements explicitly states the secretary cannot establish preconditions or conditions for considering or approving a waiver.

03:43:41.162 --> 03:43:51.148
If what I understand you just articulated the secretary articulated a condition for considering or approving a waiver that's beyond her authority in the statute.

03:43:54.568 --> 03:44:02.693
So I'm always reluctant to try to characterize what other people meant in a conversation or what we heard them say.

03:44:02.713 --> 03:44:08.356
I would just go back to what I described in looking at the statute, which is the secretary is not

03:44:09.312 --> 03:44:14.556
The secretary is not authorized essentially to approve a plan if she determines it does not meet their reading of the statute.

03:44:14.596 --> 03:44:15.236
I understand.

03:44:15.396 --> 03:44:31.108
So I think the one thing under the statutory structure is that if we submit a plan that is contingent on approval of a waiver, I think that there is very clear basis to say we're not approving your plan because it doesn't meet our reading of the statutory requirement.

03:44:31.468 --> 03:44:35.790
So, you know, I think we can follow up and have further conversation to try to clarify this.

03:44:36.171 --> 03:44:47.557
But I think rather than sort of focusing on on that issue, I think the timing and what the practical implications is something that we can work on trying to bring back to the board prior to the next meeting.

03:44:47.924 --> 03:44:57.572
Okay, so the only comment I'm going to end with at this point in the conversation is I want to understand what the priority of the state is.

03:44:57.792 --> 03:45:14.185
Is it to approve the plan for the purposes of making sure the funding continues or is it to make sure that the state has the opportunity to exercise all the flexibility that the Congress intended when they crafted the revision

03:45:14.785 --> 03:45:18.008
of No Child Left Behind and got ESSA signed into law.

03:45:18.368 --> 03:45:27.655
Because the flexibility that I'm hearing is more a one-size-fits-all interpretation and not true flexibility that states are supposed to be allowed to exercise.

03:45:27.695 --> 03:45:33.459
So I want to understand the purpose of what we're trying to accomplish with doing the revision.

03:45:33.880 --> 03:45:40.345
Simply crafting a plan that gets approved or doing the innovation that we thought we were being allowed to write into the plan.

03:45:40.845 --> 03:45:50.323
because I'm happy to know which way we're going because that will either limit or define how I consider what it is the department is asking for us to approve.

03:45:52.854 --> 03:45:55.037
I would consider it to be both of those things.

03:45:55.597 --> 03:46:08.030
I don't think California can really truly move forward with implementation of any of the provisions of the final version of the state plan until we have an approved plan and we are assured that funding will continue.

03:46:08.851 --> 03:46:12.715
It's our understanding at this point, and I know we'll certainly clarify before your next meeting,

03:46:14.036 --> 03:46:22.908
that if California and the board chooses to submit waivers at a subsequent point that that will allow for some of the flexibility that we were hoping for.

03:46:25.134 --> 03:46:26.175
Yeah, let me add to that.

03:46:26.515 --> 03:46:33.098
We have over $100 million in set-asides, which this board has not discussed.

03:46:34.058 --> 03:46:37.220
And these set-asides are under the federal law.

03:46:37.260 --> 03:46:42.062
We must withhold 7%, which is over $100 million alone of Title I.

03:46:43.323 --> 03:46:48.945
It would be very good if we could get on with deciding how we will use that assistance money.

03:46:49.985 --> 03:47:00.969
So the longer we delay, the longer I think we delay that, the discussion on the assistance money, which is something that at some point we will, we will want to deal with.

03:47:03.810 --> 03:47:05.170
Board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

03:47:07.378 --> 03:47:33.152
so please be advised that board member Burr and I did hug it out before this item and we will be good we'll be good because believe it or not there are I'm also tempted to use the W the waiver pathway for some of these recommendations and the questions I have a process question and then I know that we're gonna come back for a meeting on title one part a which is really the heart of what I've been most interested in but

03:47:36.054 --> 03:47:49.564
We can adopt or approve a plan and then internally have a motion that says we will pursue a waiver for this section and this section without including the waiver language in the plan, correct?

03:47:50.336 --> 03:47:54.880
I'll confer with Council, but I believe the answer is yes.

03:47:55.341 --> 03:48:04.630
I actually do like some of the recommendations and some of the things that are being proposed like moving the 11th grade data to our dashboard.

03:48:04.950 --> 03:48:13.858
I think the reason some folks are wondering are we moving into a dual accountability system, I think that's a fair question to ask because in the

03:48:14.659 --> 03:48:27.329
in the many, many documents that we receive for item four at various times within a two-week span, we keep on hearing this phrase that almost sounds like a caveat, for the purpose of the ESSA plan, for the purpose of the ESSA plan.

03:48:27.649 --> 03:48:33.333
And I myself was wondering, are we having these two dashboards, one with just status, one with status and change?

03:48:33.693 --> 03:48:34.674
It is confusing.

03:48:35.735 --> 03:48:39.618
And if we did commit to a one system of accountability,

03:48:40.098 --> 03:48:51.008
I do think it is possible to still have that one system of accountability, but I do want us to consider some of the things that were proposed, such as the 11th grade.

03:48:52.782 --> 03:48:59.211
If we're going to come back for that, currently we're looking at the cut scores based on third through eighth grade.

03:48:59.832 --> 03:49:10.226
And if we recall back last year, a year and a half ago, we looked at the data and for the lower grades, we see that math is up and ELA is down.

03:49:10.786 --> 03:49:14.067
In high school, ELA is up and math is down.

03:49:14.447 --> 03:49:24.771
So we should be looking at data based on actual data, not setting cut scores for 11th grade based on the lower grades because the data is trending differently.

03:49:25.511 --> 03:49:30.813
So if we are moving in that direction, I would like to see some actual data when we come back in April.

03:49:31.913 --> 03:49:56.029
and in terms of the I'll just I know that we're coming back to this but I do want to pitch it out there we do I would like us to consider waivers on things like the EOP indicator for sure and I it took me a while but I am warming up to the status plus change I think that it is important for us to keep one methodology that is consistent and but also incorporate the

03:49:56.229 --> 03:49:59.672
11th grade into the data dashboard and those interim growth targets.

03:50:00.232 --> 03:50:03.355
Thank you, baby step, but it finally puts it out there.

03:50:03.815 --> 03:50:08.198
And the data and the gaps are daunting, but they are, right?

03:50:08.839 --> 03:50:16.625
Jorge Aguilar spoke recently and he said that data humanizes education because the common denominator are students.

03:50:17.865 --> 03:50:36.714
Those tables humanize the need and they humanize our students and it speaks to why we need to really set those targets and not in an LEA report card because when we're talking about one system of accountability, we're looking at the LCAP, the LCAP addendum, and then the consolidated application, not the report card.

03:50:37.054 --> 03:50:48.242
So if we're going to put it out there and express the need, then let's follow our principles of equity, transparency, and continuous improvement and keep it together, one system of accountability.

03:50:48.683 --> 03:50:48.983
Thank you.

03:50:51.024 --> 03:50:56.468
The type of information that incorporates into our presentation at the additional meeting.

03:50:56.488 --> 03:50:59.471
Board Member Holliday.

03:51:00.387 --> 03:51:13.090
I agree with Member Lutiz in the notion that perhaps submitting and having approval of a plan would allow us then to have a waiver process come after that.

03:51:13.650 --> 03:51:19.411
And I certainly agree that the EOP is one area where I think a waiver is probably going to be really necessary.

03:51:19.491 --> 03:51:28.613
However, I am much I guess I'm much more pragmatic about this whole thing in the sense that it is a lot of money and we do not want to disrupt the flow of that money.

03:51:28.773 --> 03:51:30.013
It is important to the state.

03:51:31.164 --> 03:51:38.970
Yes, it's a small percentage compared to the California contribution, but at the same time, it's important money.

03:51:39.430 --> 03:51:51.038
I think we do need to move ahead, you know, without too many delays in order to get a plan approved and to get this behind us, if you will.

03:51:51.979 --> 03:51:52.960
I don't think that

03:51:54.574 --> 03:52:00.357
It really is an indication of two different accountability plans.

03:52:00.477 --> 03:52:08.861
When we stick to our dashboard and the data and the approach that we use and how we display it is the California way.

03:52:10.637 --> 03:52:20.002
If a part of that data, the status part, for example, is then sent to the federal government, I don't see that as a conflict.

03:52:20.042 --> 03:52:26.045
I don't see that, you know, we're sending one piece, we're not sending it in the exact same way it appears on our dashboard.

03:52:27.066 --> 03:52:31.308
So, I can live with the changes for the most part.

03:52:32.489 --> 03:52:34.810
I do agree about waivers for the LP.

03:52:35.836 --> 03:52:39.718
There are a couple other things, but in general, I think we need to keep pushing on with this.

03:52:41.098 --> 03:52:43.099
Marguerite, do you have any comment on his comments?

03:52:44.060 --> 03:52:44.280
No.

03:52:44.520 --> 03:52:44.620
OK.

03:52:44.640 --> 03:52:46.241
We'll incorporate them into our presentation.

03:52:46.281 --> 03:52:46.601
Pardon?

03:52:46.821 --> 03:52:49.702
We'll incorporate them into our presentation for the additional meeting.

03:52:49.722 --> 03:52:49.902
All right.

03:52:50.082 --> 03:52:50.603
Who's next?

03:52:51.783 --> 03:52:52.223
That's it.

03:52:52.644 --> 03:52:53.024
OK.

03:52:55.025 --> 03:52:55.725
Public comment.

03:52:58.052 --> 03:53:00.532
There are 20 people signed up for public comment.

03:53:01.273 --> 03:53:03.813
Will the following individuals please step forward to the podium?

03:53:04.233 --> 03:53:24.397
Leticia Garcia, Doug McRae, Terry Burns, Martha Alvarez, Alfonso Garza, Michael Flores Castaneda, Ken Burt, Mumi Citron, Angela Duramos, Sheila Whitley, Enrique Raucho, and Liz Guillen.

03:53:29.520 --> 03:53:30.581
Please come forward, yes.

03:53:32.582 --> 03:53:33.603
Hi, good afternoon.

03:53:33.663 --> 03:53:36.905
Leticia Garcia on behalf of Riverside County Office of Education.

03:53:37.345 --> 03:53:45.210
So basically your conversation here has reflected the conversation that we've been having with our local experts.

03:53:45.530 --> 03:53:53.915
So on behalf of educational experts in Riverside County, we urge you to reject the proposed SSA plan

03:53:56.116 --> 03:53:58.178
Instead, seek a waiver from the U.S.

03:53:58.198 --> 03:54:06.544
Department of Education and stay true to California's accountability system that is based on multiple measures and continuous improvement.

03:54:07.625 --> 03:54:20.194
The proposed changes would create a bifurcated accountability system, one based on improvement at the State level and at the Federal level based on proficiency, decoupling status from change

03:54:21.195 --> 03:54:28.877
leaves us with a system solely focused on proficiency, which tends to become over-reliant on test scores.

03:54:29.718 --> 03:54:37.980
Over the last decade, California has embraced innovation with new standards, new assessments, and new funding model rooted in equity.

03:54:38.280 --> 03:54:47.223
So we can't afford a system that ignores student achievement and improvement and measures schools against a static proficiency model.

03:54:47.703 --> 03:54:48.003
Thank you.

03:54:53.636 --> 03:54:54.217
Good afternoon.

03:54:54.277 --> 03:54:57.338
I'm Doug McGray, a retired measurement guy from Monterey.

03:54:58.719 --> 03:55:02.981
The addendum posted yesterday was, at least to me, convoluted and not clear.

03:55:03.602 --> 03:55:10.046
So I'd like to make two general observations on identification of schools and weeding.

03:55:10.806 --> 03:55:15.529
First, identification of the lowest 5% schools is a status-only calculation.

03:55:16.269 --> 03:55:23.313
The status and change strategy is better for many other dashboard applications, but identifying lowest performing is a status only.

03:55:24.133 --> 03:55:29.376
A school with low status is low performing whether or not it had significant change in recent years.

03:55:30.136 --> 03:55:33.058
Second, weights are heavily determined by federal statute.

03:55:33.898 --> 03:55:37.160
The academic indicator must be at least 50% of the weight.

03:55:37.820 --> 03:55:41.182
Do that, spread the remaining weight over the other indicators,

03:55:42.483 --> 03:55:50.169
The only exception to this, from my perspective, would be reduced weights for new data collections until they are mature enough to support full weights.

03:55:51.150 --> 03:55:54.012
Finally, I would agree with Board Member Holliday.

03:55:54.413 --> 03:55:55.774
We don't have two systems.

03:55:55.854 --> 03:56:03.900
We are providing a subset of the status and change dashboard system to the Feds.

03:56:05.522 --> 03:56:10.267
And you do not have to distribute that to all of the locals.

03:56:10.928 --> 03:56:12.910
They just get the dashboard in full flavor.

03:56:13.370 --> 03:56:13.651
Thank you.

03:56:17.432 --> 03:56:43.086
afternoon terry burns on behalf of the california school boards association and we very much appreciates the board's action to defer action on this until we can all get more information on what the real outcomes are that's always the fear is that we take action here and then the boots in the ground it works really differently than folks expected so we would just like we are very appreciative of the opportunity to look at it the three items you're taking action on today we are supportive of

03:56:44.226 --> 03:56:57.152
We do concur that it's important for you to continue to consider the waiver on the ELPI, including those students have been reclassified so that you are not discouraging reclassification.

03:56:58.132 --> 03:57:03.114
We do have the concern that it is more than simply reporting data to the feds.

03:57:03.775 --> 03:57:09.737
If there is action to be taken on that, we really are concerned that the feds will then ask for

03:57:12.398 --> 03:57:26.143
action to be taken against those schools based on those scores and that you could have a school that is out of compliance with the federal law and the federal plan but doing just fine under the California plan.

03:57:26.163 --> 03:57:29.824
So the federal government will be the right place to go.

03:57:29.984 --> 03:57:30.264
Thank you.

03:57:35.477 --> 03:57:40.980
I'm from Stockton and we have been working on this issue with our parents in Stockton.

03:57:41.000 --> 03:57:42.460
I'm with the Stockton Schools Initiative.

03:57:42.960 --> 03:57:48.462
We fight for education policy, really engaging young people on how does ESSA really impact our lives.

03:57:50.283 --> 03:58:01.467
I'm here because we are concerned with some of the cases specifically around LCFF statute and that may overlook school districts, may overlook districts that have one or two low performing schools.

03:58:01.887 --> 03:58:07.089
In Stockton we have seen that happen over and over consecutively especially with our elementary schools.

03:58:07.990 --> 03:58:10.111
Also thank you for bringing up the 11th grade.

03:58:12.591 --> 03:58:21.115
because that is something that we strongly urge you to approve, including that because we also believe that data humanizes this work.

03:58:22.255 --> 03:58:26.537
And we in Stockton move a lot of our families around this data.

03:58:27.438 --> 03:58:35.721
And so I think it will be important that we need this measure of student achievement to give us a clear measurable information regarding student performance in high schools.

03:58:36.541 --> 03:58:40.203
So if you can please consider to do that as well, we really appreciate it.

03:58:40.543 --> 03:58:44.985
We want to be able to have accountability system that's coherent and aligned.

03:58:45.025 --> 03:58:45.725
So thank you so much.

03:58:50.487 --> 03:58:54.068
Good afternoon, Enrique Rocha with the Los Angeles Unified School District.

03:58:54.128 --> 03:58:58.630
And first off, we recognize the complexity of responding to the federal government.

03:58:58.650 --> 03:59:03.272
So we're very appreciative and thankful of all the work that you have done, including your staff.

03:59:04.052 --> 03:59:07.754
Given the latest developments on item four, we definitely support the action

03:59:08.554 --> 03:59:16.176
to defer and have additional conversations and analysis on the overall conversation related to item four.

03:59:16.776 --> 03:59:27.878
We also support the identification of the lowest 5% for Title I schools as it came out in the latest information that we received regarding item four.

03:59:28.278 --> 03:59:36.020
And lastly, we would urge the consideration of a waiver as it's related to the English

03:59:36.480 --> 03:59:38.742
learner progress indicator as well.

03:59:39.162 --> 03:59:40.823
My colleagues have already said it.

03:59:40.863 --> 03:59:44.326
We believe that this is a very important issue to be considered.

03:59:44.406 --> 03:59:44.706
Thank you.

03:59:50.509 --> 03:59:57.237
Good afternoon, Martha Zaragoza-Diaz representing the California Association for Bilingual Education and Californians Together.

03:59:58.098 --> 04:00:05.627
And I just have a question in terms of two items because there's been so many blue sheets that were going around.

04:00:05.687 --> 04:00:06.769
I want to make sure that

04:00:08.230 --> 04:00:29.195
Title the the addendum to Table 3 Regarding the LP performance level is what it's going to be included in the plan forwarded to the state I mean they were forwarded to the feds if it is then we support a waiver on this item I'm unclear as to whether the exit procedures

04:00:30.235 --> 04:00:36.421
for Title III regarding English learners is also a part of what's going to be forwarded to the Feds.

04:00:38.522 --> 04:00:41.245
And if so, it is?

04:00:41.265 --> 04:00:41.705
Okay.

04:00:41.885 --> 04:00:43.187
Because it's unclear.

04:00:43.307 --> 04:00:43.587
Okay.

04:00:43.787 --> 04:00:44.107
Thank you.

04:00:44.848 --> 04:00:45.929
Just that I support the waiver.

04:00:45.949 --> 04:00:51.053
I appreciate the complexity of the issue and also support the deferment on Title IA.

04:00:51.474 --> 04:00:51.754
Thank you.

04:00:55.953 --> 04:00:59.314
Good afternoon, Michael Flores Castaneda with California Teachers Association.

04:00:59.534 --> 04:01:02.515
And I will be also speaking for the rest of our group back here.

04:01:03.095 --> 04:01:06.676
You've received our letter highlighting our specific concerns with the most recent plan.

04:01:07.916 --> 04:01:16.418
The current draft, most importantly, the current draft fails to adhere to the guiding principle, which was to create a single coherent system and avoid having two separate accountability structures.

04:01:17.058 --> 04:01:21.179
We are encouraging CDE and state board to pursue waivers in the following areas.

04:01:21.659 --> 04:01:23.920
Number one, the double counting of the 11th grade test scores.

04:01:24.700 --> 04:01:26.060
We don't need to overemphasize test scores.

04:01:26.080 --> 04:01:27.841
We've gone down that route before.

04:01:28.421 --> 04:01:33.403
Number two, deleting the reclassified English learners from the EL progress indicator.

04:01:33.883 --> 04:01:36.724
It gives no credit to the students and the schools who are making progress.

04:01:37.064 --> 04:01:41.965
And where I teach in Arvin, down in Kern County, we make a big to-do every year about the students who are re-designated.

04:01:43.886 --> 04:01:47.268
And number three, identifying the identification of the lowest 5% schools.

04:01:47.588 --> 04:01:48.329
It's still ambiguous.

04:01:48.969 --> 04:01:50.250
It's a punitive system.

04:01:50.410 --> 04:01:52.711
And again, it's not something that we need to go down that route.

04:01:52.731 --> 04:01:54.992
So we're asking for you to seek waivers in those areas.

04:01:55.513 --> 04:01:57.654
We will be back next month for the next special board meeting.

04:01:58.054 --> 04:02:00.475
And to say it with me one more time, one accountability plan.

04:02:00.996 --> 04:02:01.256
Thank you.

04:02:08.612 --> 04:02:11.533
Good afternoon Martha Alvarez on behalf of the school administrators.

04:02:12.173 --> 04:02:18.435
Huge thanks to CDE and state board staff for working under the clock in getting these items ready for public discussion today.

04:02:18.455 --> 04:02:25.178
Similar to prior comments we appreciate the delay in Title I accountability provisions of the ESSA state plan.

04:02:26.179 --> 04:02:36.331
We would also encourage the board to keep talking about a waiver, not just on the ELPI, but also for acts that we're very concerned about removing change from the indicators.

04:02:36.712 --> 04:02:42.820
We want to continue to have that inclusive conversation about status and change as part of our accountability system.

04:02:44.401 --> 04:02:49.265
And there might be other waivers we would like to pursue, but let's talk about it in the next coming month.

04:02:49.405 --> 04:03:09.001
We would ask, in addition to the options and timeline that Board Member Burr indicated, we would also ask for a table such as this one, the handout, that outlines the differences that we might have between the California dashboard system and if we were to have a different requirement for the feds so we can really clearly communicate to the field.

04:03:09.761 --> 04:03:19.406
And lastly, we would also ask for the next month to talk about system of support and how would that work between the low performing schools and linking it back to LCFF identified districts.

04:03:19.727 --> 04:03:20.027
Thank you.

04:03:26.874 --> 04:03:27.474
Good afternoon.

04:03:27.534 --> 04:03:28.735
My name is Felicia Jones.

04:03:29.015 --> 04:03:36.177
I am with COPE, a network of congregation students and parents in San Bernardino County.

04:03:36.537 --> 04:03:43.520
And we are here first to thank you for the reconsideration of the 11th grade assessment as an academic indicator.

04:03:43.560 --> 04:03:49.802
We certainly support that and hope that the board will take that into under strong consideration in the next month.

04:03:50.422 --> 04:03:58.669
We're also deeply concerned about accountability and assessment, particularly as accountability and actually support for the comprehensive schools.

04:03:58.869 --> 04:04:08.957
We are concerned that low-performing schools who may be in high-performing school districts will be overlooked, and we want to make sure that there's adequate identification and support for that.

04:04:09.577 --> 04:04:15.459
We are especially concerned about subgroups under the identification of targeted support.

04:04:16.099 --> 04:04:30.283
Again, we want to make sure the students aren't masked, particularly African-American students who continue to be underperforming in schools, and particularly in schools that may be high-performing, but the subgroups are still very much underperforming.

04:04:30.323 --> 04:04:33.804
So we certainly hope that you will take that into consideration moving forward.

04:04:33.884 --> 04:04:34.164
Thank you.

04:04:40.857 --> 04:04:44.638
on behalf of the California Association of School Counselors.

04:04:45.579 --> 04:05:00.284
The revision relative to Title VII gives us a little bit of excitement as well as nerves because counselors aren't mandated under the education code so not every school district has counselors.

04:05:00.524 --> 04:05:01.444
We're happy to change that.

04:05:02.364 --> 04:05:11.166
But we look forward to working with Marguerite on how we work together to make sure that we are serving students and utilizing the counselors that we have in those areas.

04:05:11.186 --> 04:05:15.067
So I think I'm looking forward to that and our folks are too.

04:05:15.107 --> 04:05:20.949
We want to support our homeless youth but just want to make sure we keep in context the limited number of counselors we have.

04:05:21.349 --> 04:05:28.071
And also just want to take a moment to thank the board and the staff for sticking true to what we're doing here.

04:05:29.091 --> 04:05:31.214
and to pushing back as much as we can push back.

04:05:31.334 --> 04:05:39.804
I know it has to be a very difficult conversation with the feds, but I'm not as worried about what they're doing at that level because we're doing the right thing here.

04:05:40.245 --> 04:05:43.569
So thank you and we look forward to working with you on the waivers and other pieces.

04:05:47.469 --> 04:05:49.550
Good afternoon, Samantha Tran with Children Now.

04:05:49.730 --> 04:05:58.973
And similar to the other speakers, we appreciate the additional time to really reflect and think about the identification of the 5% of schools so that we can engage in that a little bit more.

04:05:59.773 --> 04:06:02.654
Really pleased with the direction around 11th grade assessment.

04:06:02.734 --> 04:06:10.016
As I mentioned earlier, we see that assessment being used in different ways for different purposes and that that's appropriate within our system.

04:06:11.377 --> 04:06:18.122
We are also pleased with the movement around the interim goals, similar to what Member Ortiz-Lacon mentioned, small steps.

04:06:18.863 --> 04:06:22.606
I think it is going to be really important to clarify where that data is going to be.

04:06:23.066 --> 04:06:31.133
The plan mentions an LEA report card, but we haven't used that vernacular, so trying to understand where that sits in the system will be helpful.

04:06:32.614 --> 04:06:39.959
Finally, the last point I want to raise, which I know has not been talked about much today, is the issue around the exit criteria for schools.

04:06:40.179 --> 04:06:52.487
We clarified that schools can't be declining in order to exit the system, but I don't think that lends well to what we are trying to accomplish overall as a system and that we need to have higher expectations.

04:06:52.527 --> 04:06:54.688
So talking a little bit more about that would be helpful.

04:06:54.989 --> 04:06:55.469
Thank you so much.

04:06:59.827 --> 04:07:02.590
Good afternoon, Dean Drescher on behalf of EdVoice.

04:07:02.630 --> 04:07:06.113
We're really looking forward to the future meeting on the accountability items.

04:07:07.014 --> 04:07:15.862
We're heartened that the state is considering ways to help teachers by requiring LEAs to articulate what they're going to do to address inequitable distributions of teachers.

04:07:15.922 --> 04:07:24.491
And we would even encourage the department to recommend to the legislature that the state use Prop 98 general fund resources to provide that additional help.

04:07:25.251 --> 04:07:35.400
We urge the board to articulate how the state plans to provide feedback on the LCAP addendums and how the state will support LEAs in achieving an equitable distribution of teachers.

04:07:36.081 --> 04:07:41.765
We would also add that teacher effectiveness should be defined by measures of teacher impact on student outcomes.

04:07:43.067 --> 04:07:55.602
And for example, if we had a more robust definition of teacher effectiveness, regardless of years of service, the state could have recommendations of how an LEA could support teachers to become more effective to serve low-income students.

04:07:55.923 --> 04:07:56.183
Thank you.

04:08:02.281 --> 04:08:04.082
Good afternoon, Sarah Lillis with Teach Plus.

04:08:04.142 --> 04:08:10.046
And just echoing the comments from Ed Voice, we think that there is more that we can do.

04:08:10.126 --> 04:08:22.194
I think as we stand up and say we're doing this the California way, in addition to just meeting the ESSA requirements on disproportionate rates of access to effective educators, that we in California can stand up and say we can do better.

04:08:22.854 --> 04:08:28.578
We can make sure our teacher leaders really believe that access to quality teachers are the number one civil rights issue of our time.

04:08:29.278 --> 04:08:33.400
What are the questions that we can't answer from the data that we're planning to collect and report?

04:08:33.480 --> 04:08:55.152
And I think there are critical questions we still can't answer about this disproportionate access to effective teachers, looking at issues of turnover, looking at issues of absence, whether it's performance, something about where there are pockets of underperforming teachers who need extra support, and how do we really explicitly get the support to those teachers that need it and to the schools and districts that need it?

04:08:55.692 --> 04:09:04.639
We appreciate the addition on the state plan for the LEAs articulating their LCAP addendum, what they're going to do, but we do think that the state has a really important role in this as well.

04:09:04.959 --> 04:09:05.299
Thank you.

04:09:09.863 --> 04:09:11.204
Eric Primack, Charter School Center.

04:09:11.364 --> 04:09:17.769
We remember the API, AYP confusion, really strongly urge you to continue to press to avoid that.

04:09:18.709 --> 04:09:24.514
I call this as a chicken and so I can urge you to continue to play the chicken game and try to get

04:09:26.101 --> 04:09:30.208
The guy with the long title, Mr. Botel, and his boss to blank first.

04:09:31.670 --> 04:09:37.721
It is worth noting that she spoke to the Council of Chief State School Officers a little while ago, reaming

04:09:39.251 --> 04:09:41.252
assembled masses for not being innovative.

04:09:41.332 --> 04:09:44.833
And yet, here, we're putting something very innovative forward.

04:09:44.873 --> 04:09:46.754
And maybe it's time to call them on that.

04:09:47.454 --> 04:09:52.316
I will also note, though, that we feel your pain as charters, because we're always swimming upstream, too.

04:09:53.277 --> 04:10:05.462
And we continue to have concerns about the way charters are treated in the ESSA plan with respect to the teacher credentialing issues and whatnot that partially recognize our flexibility, but partially don't.

04:10:05.642 --> 04:10:08.183
And we would still like to see that clarified.

04:10:08.263 --> 04:10:08.563
Thank you.

04:10:13.089 --> 04:10:16.330
Hi again, Elizabeth Rovatay, California Charter Schools Association.

04:10:16.910 --> 04:10:30.535
While we're appreciative of the deep thought and continued work towards developing a final lowest performing 5% identification methodology, we would like to reiterate our call that academic indicators in the aggregate should receive much greater weight than non-academic indicators.

04:10:31.156 --> 04:10:34.217
Also, we applaud the department's use of distance from level 3 change.

04:10:35.517 --> 04:10:39.258
sorry, status as an academic indicator in California's ESSA application.

04:10:40.018 --> 04:10:48.880
As we've asked in previous meetings, we continue to urge the State Board to add a state academic indicator for high school to its top-level dashboard to prioritize academic outcomes.

04:10:49.980 --> 04:11:01.783
Without simple comparable academic data like the distance from level three, it's unclear how academic achievement for schools, particularly charter schools at the high school level, can be truly measured in a targeted, clear, and timely manner.

04:11:01.963 --> 04:11:02.243
Thank you.

04:11:06.206 --> 04:11:08.146
Hello, Liz Guillen with Public Advocates.

04:11:09.567 --> 04:11:27.891
Very pleased to see that the state plan now addresses or requires the district's LEAs to articulate in their LCAP addendums what they're going to do to address an equitable distribution around various teacher preparation and preparedness and assignment.

04:11:28.871 --> 04:11:34.073
We still think that there should be articulation about how the state's going to support LEAs.

04:11:35.834 --> 04:11:39.257
to equitably deliver on this.

04:11:39.997 --> 04:11:45.942
We support seeking a federal waiver around the LP.

04:11:46.983 --> 04:11:54.890
And beyond that, we're really pleased that you are keeping your focus on the federal

04:11:56.011 --> 04:12:04.464
the multiple measures and California's dashboard and just using the federal requirements for information.

04:12:04.665 --> 04:12:05.326
Thank you so much.

04:12:10.939 --> 04:12:15.263
President Kirsten, I'm Brian Revis speaking on behalf of the Education Trust West.

04:12:16.204 --> 04:12:25.653
I want to say first I understand the point about $2.8 billion relative to the entire state amount spent on education.

04:12:26.694 --> 04:12:30.398
But I think we would disagree that that's a negligible amount.

04:12:31.038 --> 04:12:32.800
We think it's still quite a bit of money.

04:12:33.381 --> 04:12:37.845
Remember, that's intended for low-income students, Title I schools.

04:12:38.726 --> 04:12:48.615
And for comparison purposes, it's about the same amount that the governor is proposing to put into LCFF this year to get us into full implementation ahead of schedule.

04:12:48.695 --> 04:12:51.878
So I would say it's an impactful amount that matters.

04:12:52.999 --> 04:12:58.502
Secondly, I think we would agree with many of the comments that Member Holiday made about the path forward.

04:12:59.483 --> 04:13:12.172
We see the changes that are being asked of you from the federal government as things that compensate for potential shortcomings in our state system, like the possible overlooking of low-performing schools or subgroups.

04:13:12.773 --> 04:13:18.517
So we would urge you to be very cautious when it comes to seeking waivers and use them sparingly.

04:13:25.130 --> 04:13:26.972
Daniel Espinoza from the Learning Policy Institute.

04:13:27.352 --> 04:13:37.181
We'd like to thank the Board for your perseverance in revising California's ESSA plan in a way that will hopefully lead to an improved plan while maintaining the heart of California's innovative accountability and continuous improvement system.

04:13:37.802 --> 04:13:46.210
The proposed revisions leave intact California's school dashboard, which takes into account both status and change, although status and change will now be reported separately for federal accountability.

04:13:46.990 --> 04:13:55.395
We feel that California's approach represents a fundamental change from the NCLB era when schools were judged solely on static test scores and not on the growth that they had been able to help students make.

04:13:55.915 --> 04:14:05.361
By holding schools accountable for both status and change across multiple measures of school and student success, California's new system encourages school behaviors that enhance educational opportunity and support greater equity.

04:14:06.661 --> 04:14:17.368
We'd also like to echo the comments of other made today regarding the English learner proficiency indicator and to support or urge the state board to seek a waiver for all the reasons stated prior.

04:14:18.209 --> 04:14:18.509
Thank you.

04:14:20.570 --> 04:14:21.391
Board member Strauss?

04:14:22.311 --> 04:14:24.553
Yeah, no, there's one more commenter.

04:14:25.793 --> 04:14:26.234
Oh, that's.

04:14:28.475 --> 04:14:29.696
I've already said my piece.

04:14:30.925 --> 04:14:39.112
So I just I feel like I first I just want to thank the State Board and CDE staff for their continued effort to help us stay coherent.

04:14:39.512 --> 04:14:53.304
And I think that's certainly been the guiding practice and philosophy in all of our work over the last several years to make a single coherent system and to help it make sense with the work as we try to improve schools and focus on improved achievement.

04:14:53.744 --> 04:15:04.652
And I do feel, and I think Eric Premack said that, that there's a mixed message coming from Washington, which is there's state control, you need to be creative, we want you to be creative, but you can't do this, this, and this.

04:15:04.692 --> 04:15:13.759
And I think that is a mixed message, and I think it's frustrating for those of us who've worked, and I'm sure other states as well, tirelessly to try to make it a coherent system.

04:15:14.300 --> 04:15:20.664
So I look forward to the meeting probably next month that we will spend more time on this, but I think a couple things.

04:15:21.565 --> 04:15:26.949
And I do, as other board members, I think there are a few of the tweaks that I think will help us and enhance our work.

04:15:26.970 --> 04:15:36.097
But I think to reinforce our philosophy, which is with low performing schools, the LEAs have a responsibility to support them.

04:15:36.557 --> 04:15:48.207
So as the CDE does their technical runs on methodology to try to identify the lowest performing schools, and I know there's a real desire in Washington to know where are the worst ones and where do we need to really help them.

04:15:48.747 --> 04:15:59.135
I think we need to remind ourselves as we move into system of support, which I know we'll spend more time in May on, is what's the support for all schools, what's the support for some, and what are the support for few?

04:15:59.515 --> 04:16:06.860
And what's the role of the LEA, what's the role of the county, what's the support of the collaborative and other support providers?

04:16:07.020 --> 04:16:10.283
Because really, our work is about improving achievement for students.

04:16:10.623 --> 04:16:17.947
which I believe in spite of all the, that's what we all want and how do we get there in a clear and coherent manner.

04:16:19.147 --> 04:16:37.637
I do think that some of the recommendations which we'll talk about are helpful but I guess lots of it is politics about the attacking the California way and why we're using colors and not numbers and not rankings and I feel like the message is stay coherent, focus on the students and LEAs and schools that need support

04:16:38.377 --> 04:16:39.038
and trust us.

04:16:39.058 --> 04:16:43.783
So I do feel a conflict on, we'll consider a waiver once we approve your plan.

04:16:43.823 --> 04:16:49.028
So therefore, write a plan that you don't really want to do, and then we'll think about you really wanting to do it.

04:16:49.108 --> 04:16:53.773
And that, I think, is the real conflict in the areas where we have agreement that we need a waiver.

04:16:54.253 --> 04:17:03.462
So, I know we'll get more guidance from staff at our next meeting, but I feel like that's a real mixed message rather than saying, we agree to all this, but we're not going to do that.

04:17:03.602 --> 04:17:08.547
And so, it's an interesting dilemma, I think, for us as we move forward.

04:17:08.627 --> 04:17:12.811
But I do agree that we need to get looking at what the action is.

04:17:13.786 --> 04:17:20.830
I share all the voices on the issue of not including reclassification and believing that that is so important.

04:17:20.850 --> 04:17:40.621
We spend a lot of time talking about the issues of reclassification and long-term English learners, so I would like to look at a way, as we submit our plan, because I know there is a requirement for waiver procedures that we have to do, but it is money that is significant to helping districts, and we want to

04:17:41.121 --> 04:17:55.456
make sure that we don't take away funds to support that, but I think philosophically the idea of focusing on long-term English learners, reclassified students and supporting them, I don't want to lose that in the message that the federal government without regulations have interpreted our direction as well.

04:17:57.218 --> 04:18:01.862
So I think, I guess I'd support by saying is that we're making progress.

04:18:01.982 --> 04:18:06.907
We've taken the coherent approach consistently through all of our actions.

04:18:07.107 --> 04:18:15.835
And I like as you come back, Margarita and the team, and Dave, I think as you think about guidance for us, how we maintain the intent of coherence.

04:18:16.235 --> 04:18:25.782
to the outcomes that we're focused on and make sense of it so that it's not a fragmented system that many of the schools and districts have lived with for so long.

04:18:26.602 --> 04:18:27.603
And so I'm hopeful.

04:18:27.623 --> 04:18:32.046
I appreciate the stakeholder input in the letters and the testimony today.

04:18:32.066 --> 04:18:44.875
I do think we have to find a way to make this work but not compromise the coherence that we've worked so hard to have in our plan.

04:18:45.215 --> 04:18:45.475
Thank you.

04:18:47.990 --> 04:18:50.371
Okay, Board Member Ortiz-Lacon.

04:18:51.512 --> 04:19:01.836
So I have two questions and one clarifying because I don't want to mislead Martha who had a question about the waiver under Title III Part A. And Veronica, I think you're here in the audience.

04:19:01.876 --> 04:19:13.521
So my understanding is when we speak the next time on Title I Part A, we'll discuss the English language proficiency indicator and then that's where some of us may want to recommend a waiver.

04:19:14.001 --> 04:19:15.802
However, under Title III Part A,

04:19:16.802 --> 04:19:20.567
We're not there's no waiver to be considered and maybe Veronica.

04:19:20.587 --> 04:19:23.050
Can you tell us a little bit about what's under that section?

04:19:23.070 --> 04:19:28.517
I mean, I have it but it's there's like five documents that I try to open and I couldn't get to it.

04:19:29.781 --> 04:19:33.163
Veronica Aguilar, Division Director for the California Department of Education.

04:19:33.203 --> 04:19:38.706
The title three part section that they wanted clarification on was the reclassification section.

04:19:39.226 --> 04:19:41.968
As you know, California has four criteria.

04:19:45.209 --> 04:19:50.032
With ESSA, we could just have one criteria, the English Language Proficiency Assessment.

04:19:50.712 --> 04:19:55.274
But because California has poor criteria, they are asking us to standardize all the criteria.

04:19:55.614 --> 04:20:02.456
As you know, there was a bill last year that is now a two-year bill, SB 463, that would look at those four criteria.

04:20:02.736 --> 04:20:15.220
We also need to wait until we have the LPAC assessment data and we have the cut scores so that we can recommend to you the reclassification criteria that it takes into account, the LPAC.

04:20:16.280 --> 04:20:27.389
In terms of teacher observation or teacher evaluation, the criteria and the parent opinion that's in law, we're proposing to do a pilot of a language observation tool.

04:20:27.969 --> 04:20:33.213
And then based on that information, we would also recommend to the board how to make that standardized.

04:20:35.034 --> 04:20:37.178
come back to us this fall, correct?

04:20:37.358 --> 04:20:40.444
The protocol, standardizing the protocol.

04:20:40.745 --> 04:20:45.754
Yes, in terms of what we would pilot with teachers once it's developed, yes.

04:20:46.812 --> 04:20:50.734
Okay so I hope that answers the question that Martha had.

04:20:51.435 --> 04:20:54.016
We will be discussing the EOP indicator the next time.

04:20:54.516 --> 04:20:54.696
Yes.

04:20:54.957 --> 04:20:55.977
Thank you Vero.

04:20:56.057 --> 04:21:15.568
The next question is on title on the identification of the title one schools the bottom 5% because I read the item the same way that some folks read it in that if we move to status only then we're identifying the bottom 5% because remember under LCFF we don't have to identify schools we have to identify LEAs.

04:21:16.088 --> 04:21:24.575
So once we move to the status for the purpose of as a plan, then I also inferred that we would be identifying based only on status.

04:21:25.136 --> 04:21:31.681
Not status and change because status and change is LCFF and what we're proposing is just status.

04:21:32.061 --> 04:21:41.469
And if that is not the case, if we could have somebody that explains what we're still, how we will identify the bottom 5% and I know we'll have more of a discussion.

04:21:41.929 --> 04:21:52.377
But again, because school identification falls under ESSA, and we're saying that under ESSA we're identifying based on status, then it does send a very conflicting message, at least to some of us that read it that way.

04:21:53.578 --> 04:21:59.062
Sure, and I just would like, certainly as you suggested, it will be covered in more depth at the upcoming special meeting.

04:21:59.602 --> 04:22:02.304
Excuse me, but if you look, oh sorry.

04:22:05.063 --> 04:22:05.343
Hello?

04:22:05.643 --> 04:22:06.723
OK.

04:22:07.303 --> 04:22:10.404
We will certainly include those into our comments at the additional meeting.

04:22:10.704 --> 04:22:16.565
But I'd like to also point folks to Addendum 1, page 2, the second paragraph.

04:22:17.025 --> 04:22:19.125
There's a sentence that I believe clarifies your point.

04:22:19.686 --> 04:22:33.748
To meet the US Department of Education's interpretation of the provisions, the CD proposes using the color-coded performance levels on dashboard indicators to identify at least the lowest performing 5% of Title I schools statewide.

04:22:36.966 --> 04:22:39.127
I know there are a lot of materials related to this item.

04:22:40.248 --> 04:22:49.413
And also one of the things that I think it came in the last yesterday's item for addendum, which I agree, I'm not against identifying the schools.

04:22:49.713 --> 04:22:56.637
I do think that through the LCAP, we could still work with the LEAs to be accountable for the schools and supporting the schools.

04:22:57.297 --> 04:23:06.625
there I think this the recommendation was to include something in the LCAP that identified the schools every three years and those schools would be part of the LCAP template.

04:23:06.966 --> 04:23:14.872
So while we may directly identify the school the support would still be on the LEA to provide that support.

04:23:15.413 --> 04:23:16.414
So I like that idea.

04:23:16.434 --> 04:23:21.218
Okay, Board Member Ting, maybe you can make a motion too.

04:23:22.782 --> 04:23:27.367
Yes, I will be very, yes, I'm almost ready.

04:23:27.427 --> 04:23:27.808
Thank you.

04:23:27.868 --> 04:23:43.344
So just quickly, I just want to echo what Dr. Kirst started this discussion with at the beginning, the gratitude to the CDE and state board staff who have worked diligently and patiently to come to a place with the Federal Department of Education

04:23:44.225 --> 04:23:55.213
that maintains a path forward under LCFF and allow us to still access federal funds to support our work and for some of our neediest students.

04:23:55.993 --> 04:24:09.022
So when I look at this and I look at a little bit higher view, I look at the changes that we've had to work with and look at, I ask myself, will this support students?

04:24:09.042 --> 04:24:10.062
Will this help kids?

04:24:10.623 --> 04:24:11.964
And I do believe it is.

04:24:12.124 --> 04:24:13.465
And that's the really the larger

04:24:13.905 --> 04:24:19.589
question I think we need to ask ourselves when we dig ourselves out of some of these details.

04:24:20.210 --> 04:24:22.091
Now, certainly more work needs to be done.

04:24:22.111 --> 04:24:28.977
I'm hopeful that the CDE and the state board staff will be able to continue working with our stakeholders.

04:24:29.617 --> 04:24:37.820
I know it is difficult to kind of read this and try to conceptualize how LCFF and these new provisions are going to work together.

04:24:37.840 --> 04:24:42.963
We will need to see how this works on the dashboard, how it's going to be displayed.

04:24:43.003 --> 04:24:48.185
I think all of those will help with that sense of coherence once we're able to see this implemented.

04:24:49.145 --> 04:25:04.650
So I do think that we need to move forward, and I do think that based on many discussions with staff that I think we can find a way that we can make these provisions work and complement LCFF and not be two different systems.

04:25:05.351 --> 04:25:16.514
So with that comment, I would like to move the approval of the proposed revisions to Section A1, disproportionate rates of access to educators, E1, Title III,

04:25:19.536 --> 04:25:33.325
1.7.G McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of the state plan pending the SBE executive director approval of final revisions requested by the SBE and correction of any typographical errors.

04:25:35.666 --> 04:25:37.107
Is there a second to that motion?

04:25:37.627 --> 04:25:45.072
One just just one clarification was the motion to section A1 or A5 disproportionate access?

04:25:46.013 --> 04:25:47.233
A5 sorry A5E1.

04:25:50.979 --> 04:25:52.262
Any further board discussion?

04:25:53.464 --> 04:25:55.308
Seeing none, all those in favor, raise your hands.

04:25:56.223 --> 04:25:58.185
OK, that is approved unanimously.

04:25:58.985 --> 04:26:02.969
So we cannot start the charter hearings till 2 o'clock.

04:26:03.069 --> 04:26:09.675
So I propose we take up and begin SBE priorities at that point.

04:26:09.715 --> 04:26:13.478
But we'll take a break first and come back and do whatever we can.

04:26:13.598 --> 04:26:19.784
Let's try and get back by quarter of 2, and then we will do whatever we can on SBE priorities.

04:26:22.356 --> 04:26:25.419
We have opened the search for our executive director.

04:26:26.820 --> 04:26:35.047
Dr. Cohn is retiring from his esteemed career, so there's information about the executive director search on our website.

04:26:35.407 --> 04:26:37.810
We've contracted with Leadership Associates.

04:26:38.610 --> 04:26:44.195
We will shortly be posting a position description, and we will begin to interview

04:26:45.577 --> 04:26:52.446
in May, the board will interview and we hope to have a new executive director selected by our June meeting.

04:26:52.526 --> 04:26:56.552
So if you know of good candidates, please send them our way.

04:26:56.572 --> 04:26:59.737
Okay, member Holiday.

04:27:06.360 --> 04:27:23.350
Well, first of all, in regards to charter schools, on behalf of Member Williams and the CDE, I wanted to make sure everyone understood that the CDE has posted the public charter schools grant program request for application on the California Department of Education website.

04:27:23.871 --> 04:27:30.855
The charter school developers may apply for these funds to assist in the development and initial operations of newly established or conversion charter schools.

04:27:31.471 --> 04:27:38.153
Charter schools who have not opened or did not begin serving students prior to July 1, 2016 are eligible to apply.

04:27:38.593 --> 04:27:45.275
All applicants must have a charter petition submitted to an authorizer before April 3rd, 2018 to be eligible.

04:27:45.816 --> 04:27:51.297
The charter petition must be approved by May 10th, 2018 to be funded.

04:27:51.417 --> 04:27:57.379
The request for application is available now and is due to the CDE on or before April 3rd, 2018 by 4 p.m.

04:28:00.951 --> 04:28:05.193
And of course, we'll have quite a bit more charter work to do.

04:28:06.853 --> 04:28:14.556
The other topic that I often report on is Environmental Literacy Steering Committee.

04:28:15.337 --> 04:28:25.721
And as much as it's great to have Glenn here, I wish Tom were sitting here right now, because I would certainly like to acknowledge

04:28:26.678 --> 04:28:38.072
how important Superintendent Torlakson was as a catalyst for beginning the work on the Environmental Literacy Initiative and the formation of the Environmental Literacy Steering Committee.

04:28:38.993 --> 04:28:43.679
We will meet again this coming Monday, I believe in Yolo County Office of Ed.

04:28:44.519 --> 04:28:53.164
To continue that work, the committee has been putting together a 10-year strategic plan, which you'll hear more about later on.

04:28:53.644 --> 04:29:07.932
But in particular, the committee and the students and the teachers of California and all of California owe Superintendent Torgerson a great deal of thanks for his efforts on behalf of environmental literacy in the state of California.

04:29:08.092 --> 04:29:08.373
Thanks.

04:29:08.393 --> 04:29:12.655
Okay, Board Member Gray.

04:29:15.806 --> 04:29:31.876
First, I was lucky enough to talk to the Fremont Unified School District board member and other students who wanted to get involved and talk about accountability and LCAP and how they could get more students involved in their guiding coalition to increase student voice.

04:29:33.736 --> 04:29:53.081
Recently, I along with the student board member on the Hawaii, New Orleans, Maryland, and Iowa state board started a state student board member Facebook group and we're hoping that that's something we can continue on for our successors so it's a way we can help each other grow in our jobs and help our successors grow in their jobs as well.

04:29:55.362 --> 04:30:02.927
I also was very involved in the walkout that happened today at my school, and it's something that I was very passionate about.

04:30:02.947 --> 04:30:11.593
I saw some videos online of some of my fellow classmates participating in it, and I'm very proud that it went very well, so yeah.

04:30:13.746 --> 04:30:30.242
Okay, we're up to my president and myself and what I would report is that Carrick Ashley and Tony Alpert of Smarter Balanced and I met with the admissions advisory committee of the California State University system.

04:30:30.982 --> 04:30:34.726
It included many of their top administrators and faculty members.

04:30:35.486 --> 04:30:44.373
And the agenda item was adding Smarter Balanced to the admissions process criteria for California State University.

04:30:45.013 --> 04:30:47.695
I think we were favorably received.

04:30:48.276 --> 04:30:57.602
Also there was Linda Rogers, Dean at UCSC, who represented Smarter Balanced as our contractor.

04:30:57.802 --> 04:31:01.065
And this is a long process in higher education to get this done.

04:31:01.945 --> 04:31:14.937
Any changes are glacial, and therefore I would say that we were encouraged, but it's a long way to go, but it's an opening discussion.

04:31:15.857 --> 04:31:17.619
So now we move to Ortiz-Lacombe.

04:31:20.637 --> 04:31:23.219
So I've been traveling to Sacramento quite a bit this year.

04:31:23.239 --> 04:31:29.122
I was able to attend the Health Framework Committee meeting and to see how this process really unfolds.

04:31:29.422 --> 04:31:42.830
I wanna thank the department and of course all of the very committed participants who really sat there through a very rigorous process and it was a very well-structured process that the department put together.

04:31:43.430 --> 04:31:46.452
And these educators were very, very passionate

04:31:47.052 --> 04:31:54.656
And we are, the health framework will be coming before the IQC next Tuesday, I'm sorry, next Thursday, March 22nd.

04:31:55.056 --> 04:31:58.418
So we should have something before us in a couple of months.

04:31:59.338 --> 04:32:12.045
And I'm also part of the, I was part of the LPAC standard setting, just observing, and that was also facilitated by the department and ETS with several EL experts and practitioners.

04:32:12.865 --> 04:32:21.289
It was a two-day, I'm sorry, a four-day process, so they had two different sessions, and I was only there for one day, and God, are these processes rigorous.

04:32:21.429 --> 04:32:27.472
I mean, they sit there, and they debate, and they look, and they're looking at the LPAC assessment.

04:32:28.132 --> 04:32:30.274
They're trying to identify the borderline student.

04:32:30.354 --> 04:32:31.535
There was a memo that went out.

04:32:31.876 --> 04:32:41.945
But I just want to say thank you to all of those educators and everyone in the department that facilitated that because it was over the course of four days, including Valentine's Day.

04:32:42.545 --> 04:32:48.891
And if there's one thing I don't want to do is look at memos and test items during Valentine's Day.

04:32:48.931 --> 04:32:51.253
So thank you for that for that passion.

04:32:52.394 --> 04:33:11.264
I won't be here in May, so I just wanted to say that because I have to be traveling, but one of the things that I know this is not related to my liaison assignments, but I am a parent, and one of the things that I would encourage us to consider, since we have the right people in the room, is how to speak to our students and our kids about some of the things that they're witnessing.

04:33:11.764 --> 04:33:17.469
whether it be the gun violence or the walkout or arming teachers, which is really arming students.

04:33:17.669 --> 04:33:18.990
Students are really alarmed by that.

04:33:19.030 --> 04:33:22.293
My elementary school kids were like, no way, mom.

04:33:22.694 --> 04:33:25.056
And as a parent, I didn't know how to respond to that.

04:33:25.536 --> 04:33:28.659
These kids are picking up on the conversations.

04:33:28.979 --> 04:33:34.424
And so if we could do something to equip parents with the talking points to help students

04:33:34.964 --> 04:33:38.508
understand the larger context and the political context, it would be great.

04:33:38.888 --> 04:33:47.095
Because the last thing I want my kindergarten student and my second grader to do is to think that their teacher is going to have a gun or that there's going to be an active shooter on their campus.

04:33:47.296 --> 04:33:55.864
And as much as we want to prevent and be aware of the reality, it's also a very traumatizing thing to have to explain to an elementary school student.

04:33:56.244 --> 04:33:56.544
Thank you.

04:33:56.564 --> 04:34:00.488
Okay, Board Member Rucker.

04:34:04.543 --> 04:34:05.443
Good afternoon.

04:34:05.903 --> 04:34:12.245
I'm looking, first of all, I want to say I had the opportunity and I wanted to thank Tom Adams for the opportunity.

04:34:12.285 --> 04:34:23.469
I had the opportunity to represent the board on February 28th on a panel that, in the LEAD Learn Conference, it was a focus from the Subject Matter Project on History, Social Science.

04:34:23.969 --> 04:34:33.952
The panel contained six different policy leaders having a discussion, not only about civic engagement, but what it really means

04:34:34.312 --> 04:34:42.736
to develop and encourage this development with students as a function and focus of the work that schools are doing.

04:34:43.116 --> 04:35:00.085
It was a very engaging panel and while a lot of the time we were speaking to the choir, there were a lot of great questions that were asked and a lot of good opportunity not only to identify areas and points of consonance and agreement about what it means to teach civic engagement and to develop

04:35:00.485 --> 04:35:11.151
civic engagement among students, but also to think about what that also means in the academic and education community at all segments, not just in K-12, but in higher education as well.

04:35:12.092 --> 04:35:20.077
In May, I'll be traveling down to Southern California to participate in the next California Interstate Compact meeting.

04:35:20.117 --> 04:35:23.999
It will be at the Camp Pendleton Marine Base on May 4th.

04:35:25.080 --> 04:35:28.081
Some of the details from the meeting that'll start around nine o'clock.

04:35:29.395 --> 04:35:40.045
is going to be at a high school near Camp Pendleton, but there's an opportunity being provided by the base commander to tour the facilities and to look at the impact of the work the compact does.

04:35:40.085 --> 04:35:48.013
I want to remind you the purpose of that particular work group is to support students who are dependents of military personnel.

04:35:48.553 --> 04:36:01.583
who have to travel to California or follow their parents from other states to make sure their transition into our schools and our school programs support their work and support their continued matriculation as students.

04:36:02.063 --> 04:36:11.270
The focus of the work that they are doing continues to be looking at how the state will add the federal requirement to report military dependents

04:36:12.030 --> 04:36:22.841
into our state's data system and to also make sure that we continue the work of the agreements that California has as a Participating in the compact Thank You board member Sandoval

04:36:24.892 --> 04:36:25.492
Good afternoon.

04:36:25.592 --> 04:36:30.856
I'll offer some updates on history, social science, adoption of materials.

04:36:31.336 --> 04:36:40.861
Final edits and corrections meetings with publishers were held on February 5th and 6th, and that was with representative IQC members and CDE staff.

04:36:41.462 --> 04:36:50.947
And all of the state board approved edits and corrections were reviewed and finalized, and we can expect final versions and the price list to be available early April.

04:36:52.168 --> 04:36:54.251
for Visual and Performing Arts Standards.

04:36:54.811 --> 04:37:09.749
The Visual and Performing Arts Standards Advisory Committee is halfway through in the work in updating the Visual and Performing Arts Standards, also known as VAPA, and their next meeting is April 4th and 5th, and the committee will be continuing their work on revisions to the standards.

04:37:10.289 --> 04:37:17.774
All members of the public are invited to participate in that work and provide public comment, or you can submit comment in writing.

04:37:17.794 --> 04:37:25.880
So you can write to VAPA at CDE.California.gov and that's one way to participate in the process.

04:37:26.761 --> 04:37:34.386
For the California State Summer School for the Arts, applications were due February 23rd and more than 1,400 applications were received.

04:37:37.348 --> 04:37:38.349
for 500 slots.

04:37:39.709 --> 04:37:52.416
So these applications came from high school students from every corner of California, an impressive number of strong applications from rural parts of California, so I have to commend the outreach that's being done.

04:37:53.977 --> 04:37:59.042
The administrators, the staff of California State Summer School for the Arts is doing a phenomenal job.

04:37:59.522 --> 04:38:06.889
There's seven disciplines in this Summer School for the Arts, film, animation, writing, dance, music, theater, and visual arts.

04:38:07.510 --> 04:38:15.778
And every year, in this wonderful pre-professional training program, the school brings in artists from around the world, actually.

04:38:16.639 --> 04:38:19.301
and just some names to note.

04:38:19.481 --> 04:38:29.609
Acclaimed LA Fusion Dance Company, Body Traffic, and there's an emerging East LA-based music group called Kwekani, and those are just some of the names.

04:38:29.970 --> 04:38:32.211
Another thing that I'd like to highlight is one of the

04:38:34.125 --> 04:38:42.328
school alum, Adrián Molina, who is the co-director of Coco, Oscar award-winning.

04:38:43.128 --> 04:38:48.610
And so what was really wonderful is he acknowledged the role of this wonderful public school for the arts.

04:38:49.390 --> 04:38:56.352
He said it was there that he found his tribe, and where his path to becoming an award-winning Pixar animator truly began.

04:38:56.672 --> 04:39:02.434
So I think that speaks to the power of this school, which is in its 32nd year of operation.

04:39:03.829 --> 04:39:08.151
And then for special education, regrettably, I could not attend the Advisory Commission meeting.

04:39:08.831 --> 04:39:14.234
However, my colleague, Member Valdez, did, so I'd like to invite her to say a few words about her time.

04:39:16.955 --> 04:39:21.677
So it was a full agenda, and it was an amazing commission panel and a great opportunity.

04:39:22.277 --> 04:39:33.142
Very inclusive agenda, and it really showed the leadership and the passion around special ed within the state, with two-thirds of our districts identified for differentiated assistance.

04:39:34.382 --> 04:39:38.863
qualifying, if you will, because of our performance with students with disabilities.

04:39:38.943 --> 04:39:42.184
It's all hands and hearts on deck and that was very evident that day.

04:39:42.224 --> 04:40:00.709
I think one of the highlights of the day was one of the agenda items was on the system, the continuum of care and the idea that multiple agencies have to come together to talk about wraparound services and the child welfare and the mental health and that was very evident because we know that so many of our students, whether they're special ed or not, the whole

04:40:01.949 --> 04:40:16.339
focus and Sadly the opportunity to experience trauma is across all groups But especially special ed was one of the areas that we talked about that on that day It really inspired me to begin to think about an integrated system framework.

04:40:16.379 --> 04:40:23.544
And I think that's where we're going that we have Academics and we have behavior and we have social emotional and how are we putting them all together?

04:40:23.605 --> 04:40:27.647
What do they look like and it brings everything together when we're talking about whether it's RTI MTSS

04:40:30.049 --> 04:40:33.451
system of support, it's really looking at all that continuum of services.

04:40:33.511 --> 04:40:35.392
So that was a highlight of the day.

04:40:35.812 --> 04:40:37.133
Very, very strong agenda.

04:40:37.293 --> 04:40:43.877
And I think as Director Wright talked about, we have special ed at the table.

04:40:43.917 --> 04:40:45.157
We're being very inclusive.

04:40:45.197 --> 04:40:46.058
And so now what?

04:40:46.118 --> 04:40:47.038
And so that's the job.

04:40:47.078 --> 04:40:49.079
And very passionate leaders talking about that.

04:40:49.740 --> 04:40:51.441
Thank you.

04:40:51.461 --> 04:40:51.501
OK.

04:40:51.561 --> 04:40:53.882
Board member Strauss.

04:40:54.571 --> 04:40:57.914
So I'm just going to focus on several areas.

04:40:58.334 --> 04:40:59.114
First, science.

04:40:59.595 --> 04:41:03.298
The Science Collaboration Committee met on March 2nd.

04:41:03.638 --> 04:41:18.309
The Collaboration Committee is a group of 30, 35 people who work to plan the community of practice that meets three times a year, really committed, trying to align the practice, focusing on administrative and core concepts and really enthusiastic.

04:41:19.090 --> 04:41:19.750
There's also a

04:41:21.231 --> 04:41:25.596
There was another meeting on March 1st, the day before, with the NGSS early implementers.

04:41:25.936 --> 04:41:40.192
They had a meeting in San Diego at High Tech High with the superintendent's roundtable, and particularly committed to and reports from each of the participating districts on what's working, what they're finding, what their information is, and so this was focused on the district leadership teams.

04:41:41.092 --> 04:41:46.635
The materials review process begins on April 16th, and so CDE will be guiding that process.

04:41:47.296 --> 04:41:58.982
My encouragement to them was to make sure they spend plenty of time with their staff on their frameworks so that when they get to an adopted materials that we hope to recommend in November, they'll actually be good consumers when they look to that in 2019.

04:42:01.331 --> 04:42:23.974
The Social Emotional Learning Task Force, that's a group that's led through CDE, met in Oakland on January 22nd, and there's now a compendium of resources that are posted on CDE, and I think they would like in the future to be able to share, should we have any space in our agenda for any updates on what resources there are to show how to integrate that into the work that we're doing.

04:42:24.794 --> 04:42:31.879
We have a Standards Implementation Steering Committee that's coordination between CDE, CCESA, and State Board.

04:42:32.619 --> 04:42:37.102
There was a meeting of that group that met in Huntington Beach at the end of January.

04:42:37.503 --> 04:42:54.334
The CalSTAN Network, which is the network's advisory that WestEd ran, it was all focused on English learners implementations, or what are the next steps statewide to support English learners, and really some thoughtful recommendations that each of the subcommittees around the state looked at.

04:42:55.915 --> 04:42:57.876
the Standards Committee Advisory.

04:42:57.896 --> 04:43:00.817
We meet quarterly, and they met in the early part of February.

04:43:01.498 --> 04:43:05.900
On accountability, several different venues for discussion.

04:43:06.640 --> 04:43:11.063
The AXA Superintendent Symposium was in Monterey on the 25th of January.

04:43:11.143 --> 04:43:12.944
We talked a lot about systems to support.

04:43:12.964 --> 04:43:22.709
We had lots of county leads there, and some superintendents really talking about what the next steps are with system support, which we've been talking about here at the State Board meeting.

04:43:23.790 --> 04:43:38.062
In Riverside, there was a panel meeting in February with an education panel summit, also talking about what the next steps are with the voice from state board matched by a local center, local assemblyman talking about what the needs are.

04:43:38.342 --> 04:43:41.886
So I think everyone's looking at ways to now move into implementation.

04:43:42.426 --> 04:43:48.912
And at LA County, Nancy Brunel, who's still actively out there doing our work as a member of WASC, we represented

04:43:49.672 --> 04:43:53.954
the state implementing the California way with strategies for success at L.A.

04:43:54.014 --> 04:43:54.394
County.

04:43:54.454 --> 04:43:56.154
And so we had a large group of L.A.

04:43:56.194 --> 04:43:57.755
County districts presented as well.

04:43:58.135 --> 04:44:05.177
My final comments are around CTC because CTC does work with credentialing around many of the areas that we're talking about with college and career.

04:44:05.637 --> 04:44:13.420
A lot of focus on early child development and a lot of discussions about what we need to do to strengthen that, why we need child development teachers.

04:44:14.060 --> 04:44:23.303
Lots of stakeholders talking about that as well, and then quite a bit of discussion about career tech and how long it takes to get the credential, how we prepare them.

04:44:23.343 --> 04:44:25.143
There's a shortage of CTE teachers.

04:44:26.164 --> 04:44:28.825
We had a lot of testimony about that and some concern.

04:44:28.845 --> 04:44:29.925
You'll hear more about that.

04:44:30.365 --> 04:44:37.450
And then some about the reading instruction competency assessment, better known as RICA, and that it's not aligned with Common Core.

04:44:38.051 --> 04:44:41.433
How could we better assess teachers' competency in the reading assessment?

04:44:41.734 --> 04:44:50.060
So I think we'll hear more about these, but a lot of these link into the work we're talking about as far as early childhood content support for teachers.

04:44:50.820 --> 04:44:53.242
Very active, and you'll continue to hear more.

04:44:53.282 --> 04:44:58.206
And thanks to Pam Kasselman for always supporting me in my work at CTC as well.

04:44:58.737 --> 04:44:59.017
Thank you.

04:44:59.037 --> 04:45:00.697
Board Member Sun.

04:45:02.178 --> 04:45:02.578
Very good.

04:45:02.998 --> 04:45:10.500
So the California Workforce Pathways Joint Advisory Committee is meeting tomorrow.

04:45:10.520 --> 04:45:14.381
No, excuse me, Friday after our state board meeting.

04:45:15.081 --> 04:45:16.841
And we're going to be in that meeting.

04:45:17.041 --> 04:45:23.423
It'll be the first time we can really dig into some guiding principles that will support K-14 pathways.

04:45:24.043 --> 04:45:25.244
to careers.

04:45:25.664 --> 04:45:41.634
So there have been several common themes that have come up in our looking at the different programs that are out there and systems of support for students as they move from the K-12 into the community colleges.

04:45:42.214 --> 04:45:59.241
And so we're looking at principles that will provide infrastructure and support on a regional and local educational agencies to build efforts to connect, to build connected, equitable, accessible and high quality K-14 college and career pathways and beyond.

04:45:59.821 --> 04:46:07.764
So we will be digging into that and I'm hoping that we can provide you with a refined draft very soon for the rest of you to review.

04:46:10.425 --> 04:46:12.128
OK, now board member Valdez.

04:46:15.032 --> 04:46:21.321
My only other report is going to be about the World Language Committee they met, and they will be meeting again next week.

04:46:23.425 --> 04:46:24.106
Member Williams.

04:46:26.562 --> 04:46:33.345
So there's been a lot of work that's gotten started on computer science, expansion of computer science in K-12 in California.

04:46:33.526 --> 04:46:44.151
I think that 2018 is going to wind up being felt as the year that California got serious about expanding computer science education, at least at the state policy level.

04:46:44.811 --> 04:46:55.797
As an example, we have a computer science standards advisory committee, and they have met, they have finished their work for the first draft.

04:46:56.837 --> 04:47:04.422
of model standards for computer science and that will be going to IQC later on in March for review.

04:47:04.843 --> 04:47:15.210
It'll then go out for public comment and eventually come back to IQC and then it's expected to come to the board I believe in September for consideration of adoption.

04:47:16.090 --> 04:47:29.033
In addition, Senate Bill 2329, I think it is, created a computer science strategic implementation advisory panel, and they had their first meeting last week.

04:47:29.133 --> 04:47:36.695
This is 23 members, the majority appointed by the governor, some by the state superintendent, some by the legislature.

04:47:37.535 --> 04:47:39.596
And I attended that two-day meeting.

04:47:39.636 --> 04:47:48.340
It was their first two-day meeting, and then they'll have another two-day meeting in April, and then skip June and have their final two-day meeting in June.

04:47:48.500 --> 04:48:01.927
And they are supposed to, by statute, take a look at various kinds of interrelated issues that need to be considered when expanding computer science in California in K-12, like will teachers need credentials?

04:48:02.367 --> 04:48:09.428
and if, or supplemental authorizations, or what kind of training, what will be okay and what will not, and which teachers.

04:48:10.149 --> 04:48:12.729
A variety of other, what are the resources for it?

04:48:13.089 --> 04:48:16.830
What kind of curriculum and professional development is already out there available?

04:48:17.190 --> 04:48:22.531
Which of it is free and which of it is for a fee?

04:48:23.031 --> 04:48:25.051
Does there need to be any additional state resources?

04:48:25.111 --> 04:48:27.392
So they'll take a look at a wide variety of things.

04:48:28.232 --> 04:48:43.378
and they will finish their recommendations in June and then the CDE will take the next step of determining how to turn that into a plan that would be eventually come to the State Board for consideration of adoption.

04:48:45.118 --> 04:49:01.325
Another CS thing that is a state policy is, like President Kirst, I have been meeting and talking by email and phone with UC Boards for the last 20 months.

04:49:01.866 --> 04:49:09.369
They reached out to me since I have been a liaison to Next Generation Science Standards and the lead on computer science education.

04:49:10.429 --> 04:49:24.702
The board adopted NGSS in September of 2013 and within a year and a half or two years, UC boards revised their Area D description of goals and criteria to align very tightly with NGSS.

04:49:25.762 --> 04:49:29.045
including the practices in NGSS, which are very different.

04:49:29.065 --> 04:49:31.327
They represent very different conceptual shifts.

04:49:31.847 --> 04:49:45.237
But the other thing is that NGSS has standards for engineering and applied science, and it has practices for computational thinking, and it has standards that have to do with human impact on the environment.

04:49:45.678 --> 04:49:51.162
And so this past 18, 20 months, UC Boards has had a working group of

04:49:52.783 --> 04:50:09.757
of UC faculty in science and computer science meeting to talk about whether or not they should consider expanding the courses that might be eligible to be considered and approved under Area D beyond the traditional sciences, and those might include environmental science,

04:50:10.558 --> 04:50:14.522
some kinds of applied sciences, computer science and engineering.

04:50:15.003 --> 04:50:23.913
So they've been making pretty good progress on that, and I think that probably we will hear some news from them by the end of this spring or this summer.

04:50:25.254 --> 04:50:30.556
On the NGSS front, Member Strauss is handling the instructional materials.

04:50:31.016 --> 04:50:34.157
I've never been a teacher, so I said, please.

04:50:34.917 --> 04:50:35.638
She said, of course.

04:50:36.558 --> 04:50:42.840
So I did get invited and participated last week on a public policy institute of California

04:50:43.340 --> 04:50:46.722
panel on NGSS implementation in California.

04:50:46.822 --> 04:50:48.582
It was a terrific panel.

04:50:48.722 --> 04:50:50.023
I loved the way it was handled.

04:50:50.063 --> 04:50:52.184
It was standing room only in the room.

04:50:53.264 --> 04:51:08.051
And it was with Jessica Sacco from the Executive Director of the California Science Teachers Association, plus a science lead teacher at Moreno Valley School District.

04:51:09.111 --> 04:51:12.676
I apologize, I can't remember her last name, but it was Stacy, and she was fabulous.

04:51:13.116 --> 04:51:18.563
So what we had was, I did the state policy from, you know, how the policy is implemented and what they all were.

04:51:19.044 --> 04:51:24.711
Jessica Sacco did, well, here's what we see as an overview about how implementation is going in the state.

04:51:25.071 --> 04:51:36.578
And then Stacy did, this is how we're doing it in our school district and how we've handled, for instance, like the difficult decision of whether to go with discipline focused or integrated model for middle grades.

04:51:36.938 --> 04:51:38.800
And it was really well received.

04:51:39.240 --> 04:51:43.763
And the other fun part about it is they ended the panel by asking each of us,

04:51:44.403 --> 04:52:05.986
to kind of step out of their roles and not represent our organizations, but just speaking from our perspective, what is it that we would hope that the next elected education officials in California, the governor, the superintendent, the board members, the legislature, what would we hope they might do to further advance implementation and next generation science standards?

04:52:06.366 --> 04:52:12.553
So that was kind of fun to speculate and pretend we had like a magic wand and could make something like that happen.

04:52:13.033 --> 04:52:19.960
And lastly, I attended last month the advisory commission on charter schools as I do every other month when I'm not at a board meeting.

04:52:21.362 --> 04:52:21.742
Thank you.

04:52:22.984 --> 04:52:26.646
That concludes that item, the SBE priority.

04:52:26.707 --> 04:52:36.833
So we're now ready for item 5, the petition for the establishment of a charter school in the Bayview District of the San Francisco Unified School District.

04:52:37.454 --> 04:52:40.576
And Lisa Constancio, our CDE, will present.

04:52:41.196 --> 04:52:48.542
Then we will have discussion by the Board or questions by the Board, I should say, on technical issues.

04:52:48.622 --> 04:52:53.606
Then we'll have the public hearing and then more Board comment and discussion.

04:52:54.287 --> 04:52:54.747
Go ahead.

04:52:58.350 --> 04:53:04.995
Is that better?

04:53:05.235 --> 04:53:05.495
Okay.

04:53:06.096 --> 04:53:06.756
Sorry about that.

04:53:07.117 --> 04:53:09.178
You only missed my introduction, so that was all fine.

04:53:12.880 --> 04:53:13.341
Is it back?

04:53:14.141 --> 04:53:15.342
Okay.

04:53:15.442 --> 04:53:16.142
Item 5.

04:53:17.182 --> 04:53:18.003
Everyone can hear me now?

04:53:18.083 --> 04:53:18.983
Okay.

04:53:19.363 --> 04:53:25.126
Item 5 is an appeal by KIPP Bayview Elementary School to establish a new charter school.

04:53:25.927 --> 04:53:35.511
Pursuant to the Ed Code section 47605J, petitioners for a charter school that have been denied at the local level may petition the State Board for approval.

04:53:41.848 --> 04:53:49.257
On November 14, 2017, the San Francisco Unified School District voted to deny the petition on a vote of 7 to 0.

04:53:50.158 --> 04:53:56.185
On November 28, 2017, KIPP submitted an appeal to the State Board of Education.

04:53:59.110 --> 04:54:02.692
The program proposed is a TK-4 site-based program.

04:54:03.172 --> 04:54:11.937
Their targeted enrollment is 137 students in the first year, 2018-19, increasing to 437 students by year 2022-23.

04:54:12.237 --> 04:54:23.623
They are targeting traditionally underserved pupils in the San Francisco Unified School District, and specifically those in the Bayview-Hunters Point area and surrounding neighborhoods.

04:54:25.970 --> 04:54:33.194
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools met on February 7th, 2018, and the commission moved to recommend approval of the petition.

04:54:33.815 --> 04:54:36.296
The motion passed with a vote of five to two.

04:54:37.257 --> 04:54:44.181
The petitioner then submitted some additional information after the ACCS meeting that was reviewed by CDE staff.

04:54:45.282 --> 04:54:51.566
The details of that review are included in the item of the additional information that we did review after the ACCS meeting.

04:54:53.427 --> 04:55:01.289
The CDE is recommending that the State Board hold a public hearing to approve the request to establish KIPP Bayview for a five-year term.

04:55:02.030 --> 04:55:15.194
The recommendation is based on demonstrably likely to implement the attended program based on a sound financial plan and operational plan, and a sound educational practice and comprehensive description of the educational program.

04:55:16.434 --> 04:55:18.855
I am here and available for any questions that you may have.

04:55:30.551 --> 04:55:32.131
I just want a clarification.

04:55:32.192 --> 04:55:38.213
It's my understanding that that CDE reached out and wanted just some clarification on a couple of items.

04:55:38.713 --> 04:55:43.134
Nothing substantive that changed anything about the petition, just some clarifications.

04:55:43.294 --> 04:55:43.614
Correct.

04:55:43.714 --> 04:55:52.196
We had some questions about philanthropic funding, for example, and so we did get some additional information from the KIPP Foundation, bank statements, financial statements.

04:55:52.956 --> 04:55:54.737
We also had some questions about

04:55:55.297 --> 04:56:02.519
the San Francisco Proposition A and H and how the narrative language was was in the proposition.

04:56:02.999 --> 04:56:08.901
We got some clarification on that and then we're able to include those funds as part of the financial analysis.

04:56:09.201 --> 04:56:10.321
Once you got the clarification?

04:56:10.341 --> 04:56:10.721
Correct.

04:56:10.981 --> 04:56:15.122
And the law allows interaction getting the clarification at all levels.

04:56:15.202 --> 04:56:17.783
It could be at the district level, the county level, or the state level?

04:56:18.674 --> 04:56:21.015
We felt we were just clarifying information.

04:56:21.415 --> 04:56:22.576
So that's my point.

04:56:22.616 --> 04:56:25.116
We felt that it was within our purview to do so.

04:56:25.316 --> 04:56:25.677
Thank you.

04:56:27.077 --> 04:56:30.118
All right I'm going now going to declare the public hearing open.

04:56:30.818 --> 04:56:38.141
So first we're going to hear from the supporters of the CDE staff recommendation to approve the charter school petition.

04:56:38.621 --> 04:56:43.263
This is the KIPP charter school group will start first and they you have a

04:56:44.223 --> 04:56:47.887
under the public hearing, a total of 10 minutes to present to us.

04:56:49.028 --> 04:56:59.800
Then the district and county and other speakers will have a chance to speak against the CDE recommendation and against the establishment of the charter school.

04:57:06.587 --> 04:57:07.987
and they have 10 minutes also.

04:57:09.288 --> 04:57:13.789
Then we will go to public comment and each commenter will have one minute.

04:57:15.309 --> 04:57:19.871
And therefore, we'll hear public comment for as long as that's needed.

04:57:20.431 --> 04:57:30.634
And then after receiving all public comment, I will close the public hearing on this item and commence with board discussion and action on the recommendation.

04:57:31.514 --> 04:57:34.435
So if your PowerPoint's ready, you may go ahead.

04:57:34.495 --> 04:57:35.435
Thank you.

04:57:36.397 --> 04:57:37.778
Good afternoon board members.

04:57:38.039 --> 04:57:40.521
Thank you for thoughtfully considering our charter petition.

04:57:41.202 --> 04:57:45.086
My name is Allie Welch and I'm the founding principal of Kipp Bayview Elementary.

04:57:46.187 --> 04:57:58.479
I became a teacher eight years ago and I am now a school leader because I believe that all students deserve a world class education that enables them to reach their fullest potential and live lives of choice and opportunity.

04:57:59.640 --> 04:58:06.450
And I believe that all families deserve to have access to public schools that make this vision a reality for their children.

04:58:09.028 --> 04:58:17.810
We are here today because when it comes to equity in education, San Francisco is far behind, and families are coming together to demand change.

04:58:18.950 --> 04:58:22.890
This map shows the rankings of San Francisco schools across the city.

04:58:23.851 --> 04:58:36.933
The schools with the best student outcomes are largely in the northern and western neighborhoods, and communities like Bayview Hunters Point in the southeastern part of the city have limited access to quality options in and around their own neighborhood.

04:58:38.476 --> 04:58:44.561
As a result, a majority of families are choosing to send their children to district schools far from where they live.

04:58:45.521 --> 04:58:47.523
We cannot allow this to continue.

04:58:49.284 --> 04:58:54.388
There is a true need for a quality elementary school option in Bayview Hunters Point.

04:58:57.563 --> 04:59:05.269
Since 2003, KIPP Bay Area Schools has provided high quality education to over 1,000 families in Bayview-Hunters Point.

04:59:06.390 --> 04:59:10.713
We want to open KIPP Bayview Elementary in direct response to family demand.

04:59:11.874 --> 04:59:19.580
We have spent time listening to and learning from community members about their experiences and what they want in an elementary school for their children.

04:59:21.061 --> 04:59:30.265
I met a mother whose youngest child is entering kindergarten and who said to me, if we don't open this fall, she will be forced to look at costly parochial options.

04:59:31.846 --> 04:59:34.447
She deserves Kipp Bayview Elementary as an option.

04:59:36.423 --> 04:59:43.325
I heard the story of one of our KIPP alumni who graduated from our high school and whose younger brother is entering kindergarten this fall.

04:59:44.486 --> 04:59:55.730
She believes that attending our elementary school will set her brother up for continued success in middle school, high school, college, and beyond, an opportunity she wished she had had for herself when she was younger.

04:59:57.757 --> 05:00:07.884
I met a mom who toured our Kipp Elementary School in Redwood City with me, and after observing classrooms, said that it was the type of learning environment that she wants for her daughter in San Francisco.

05:00:09.785 --> 05:00:23.855
And I heard the stories of Bayview Hunters Point community leaders, such as preschool directors and pastors, who have seen the impact Kipp has had on their children that they've worked with, and who want to be able to share this elementary option with their families.

05:00:25.950 --> 05:00:30.094
These are just a few of the stories from families that they have shared with me.

05:00:31.535 --> 05:00:38.101
All of the stories from our Bayview Hunters Point families and community members deeply matter and cannot be silenced.

05:00:39.062 --> 05:00:41.865
They're asking KIPP for an elementary school in their neighborhood.

05:00:42.645 --> 05:00:44.947
We are committed to opening that school this fall.

05:00:45.728 --> 05:00:48.511
Their dreams for their children's futures are in your hands.

05:00:53.106 --> 05:01:07.072
The two schools that KIPP currently operates in Bayview Hunters Point, our middle school KIPP Bayview Academy, and our high school KIPP SF College Prep, both predominantly serve Bayview Hunters Point families and have a longstanding track record of success.

05:01:08.272 --> 05:01:21.417
Both schools' academic results on last year's Smarter Balanced Assessment, shown in the graph in blue, exceeded those of peer district schools in Bayview Hunters Point, shown in orange, as well as the California state average, which is shown in gray.

05:01:23.318 --> 05:01:32.164
In fact, KIPP SF College Preps Charter was recently unanimously renewed by SFUSD because of its strong student outcomes and the quality of its program.

05:01:35.046 --> 05:01:43.891
By opening KIPP Bayview Elementary, we will honor the promise we made to families by giving students an earlier start and a continuous journey to and through college.

05:01:45.012 --> 05:01:50.716
At KIPP Bayview Elementary, we promise to honor the collective strength of our students, family, staff, and community.

05:01:51.636 --> 05:01:59.623
We believe that all students are capable of achieving at the highest levels and should be seen and valued at school for who they authentically are.

05:02:00.824 --> 05:02:11.174
And we will cultivate a learning environment that is nurturing, rigorous, and reflective of our community's identities and aspirations so that our students are empowered to lead fulfilling, choice-filled lives.

05:02:13.976 --> 05:02:24.473
To make this vision a reality, all of our students will have access to a rigorous academic program, be a part of a powerful learning community, and participate in opportunities for deeper learning.

05:02:26.570 --> 05:02:38.379
We will implement a common core aligned academic program through a balanced literacy approach and through a math curriculum that emphasizes building students' fluency, conceptual understanding, and problem-solving skills.

05:02:39.500 --> 05:02:44.904
Through daily small group instruction, our students will receive differentiated support that meets their needs.

05:02:49.571 --> 05:02:57.377
We will cultivate an inclusive, nurturing, and safe community where students receive explicit social-emotional learning development in all grade levels.

05:02:58.517 --> 05:03:05.663
Daily classroom community circles that follow a responsive classroom approach will ensure that our students feel a sense of belonging at school.

05:03:07.324 --> 05:03:17.410
We will implement restorative practices to hold our students accountable to choices that they make through opportunities for reflection and logical consequences rather than through punitive measures.

05:03:18.670 --> 05:03:24.294
We believe in setting high expectations and high supports to help all of our students be their best selves.

05:03:27.432 --> 05:03:34.882
Opportunities for deeper learning will bring students' identities and strengths into the classroom, making school more relevant and purposeful for them.

05:03:35.903 --> 05:03:41.571
Beginning in year one, all students will have the opportunity to participate in arts-based electives during the school day.

05:03:42.932 --> 05:03:49.895
In all grade levels, students will also engage in project-based tasks aligned to Teaching Tolerance's social justice standards.

05:03:51.196 --> 05:04:00.320
And once our founding classes enter third and fourth grade, they will participate in choice-based electives that allow them to more deeply explore an area of personal interest.

05:04:02.987 --> 05:04:06.008
KIPP Bayview Elementary is committed to serving all students.

05:04:06.848 --> 05:04:13.690
We uphold a fair and transparent enrollment process that is open to all families and is free of admission requirements.

05:04:14.931 --> 05:04:22.613
Of the families who have already applied to our school, a majority of them live in Bayview Hunters Point and the surrounding southeast neighborhoods of San Francisco.

05:04:25.666 --> 05:04:32.167
We expect that about 40 percent of our students will be English learners and about 10 percent will need special education services.

05:04:32.667 --> 05:04:34.187
We are committed to their success.

05:04:35.228 --> 05:04:44.769
Language development will be consistently integrated into daily lessons to provide multiple opportunities for students to explicitly practice their oral and written language skills.

05:04:46.069 --> 05:04:54.791
Our extended school day daily small group instruction and personalized learning programs will enable teachers to support and track the growth of our English learners.

05:04:56.576 --> 05:05:02.659
Response to intervention and student success team structures will allow our school to monitor the progress of our students.

05:05:03.579 --> 05:05:14.524
For students who need additional interventions, our special education team will work closely with students' families to put in place an individualized education plan that meets their child's learning needs.

05:05:15.865 --> 05:05:19.006
All of our special education services are free to parents.

05:05:22.560 --> 05:05:31.004
By approving this school, you will grant hundreds of families in Bayview-Hunters Point the right to choose a KIPP Elementary education for their children.

05:05:32.144 --> 05:05:47.632
Our students will play, learn, and grow in a learning environment where we care for ourselves and others, where we value our identities and differences, where we leverage our strengths, and where we always pursue excellence and honor the power of our community.

05:05:48.912 --> 05:05:58.694
Our students will embody these values and will enter fifth grade with a strong foundation of academic and social emotional learning skills that will prepare them for life and career.

05:06:00.114 --> 05:06:06.896
We sincerely appreciate the positive recommendations from the ACCS and CDE staff to approve our charter petition.

05:06:07.776 --> 05:06:18.298
Please consider these recommendations and listen to the voices of parents and community members who have put their trust in us and vote today to approve Kipp Bayview Elementary.

05:06:26.181 --> 05:06:28.463
KIPP is powerful.

05:06:29.284 --> 05:06:30.745
KIPP is a great opportunity.

05:06:31.585 --> 05:06:33.767
KIPP Bayview Elementary is vital to my community.

05:06:34.388 --> 05:06:48.659
As a pastor in the Bayview community, I've seen kids graduate from KIPP and excel on to college and it's been a wonderful experience to see kids matriculate to higher levels of education because of what KIPP has done in my community.

05:06:49.790 --> 05:06:56.672
KIPP is integral to the success of students, young boys, young black men in this community.

05:06:57.012 --> 05:07:09.776
We need something like KIPP, a school like KIPP in this community that lets our kids know from the beginning, from kindergarten, that college is possible, that they can make it as long as they choose to succeed.

05:07:10.376 --> 05:07:14.877
We need KIPP Elementary and our neighborhood to complete the KIPP circle.

05:07:17.096 --> 05:07:19.698
Thank you for your consideration of our charter petition.

05:07:19.798 --> 05:07:22.240
We look forward to addressing any questions you have.

05:07:29.765 --> 05:07:33.848
Now we have 10 minutes for the opponents to the charter petition.

05:07:38.371 --> 05:07:39.712
District and county members.

05:07:48.359 --> 05:07:48.963
Good afternoon.

05:07:50.331 --> 05:07:50.714
Am I on?

05:07:52.436 --> 05:07:54.618
Good afternoon, President Kirst and board members.

05:07:55.979 --> 05:07:57.260
My name is Michael Davis.

05:07:57.400 --> 05:08:04.645
I'm the Director of Policy and Planning and Charter Schools for San Francisco Unified School District and County Office of Education.

05:08:05.786 --> 05:08:09.709
I'm not here as an opponent of the recommendation.

05:08:09.769 --> 05:08:20.036
I'm here as a proponent of the prerogatives of the San Francisco Unified School District Board of Education and the constituents that they serve.

05:08:22.785 --> 05:08:26.467
I just want to recap how we got here.

05:08:26.968 --> 05:08:40.096
Currently in San Francisco, as has been mentioned by the petitioners, our board currently authorizes three KIPP schools, two middle schools and one high school.

05:08:41.717 --> 05:08:58.249
We would all agree that as measured by standardized test scores, the SBAC currently, that those three schools are producing good outcomes for historically underserved students in our district.

05:09:01.131 --> 05:09:02.152
That is not a dispute.

05:09:03.496 --> 05:09:24.217
The issue we have here is that within the very narrow constraints outlined by the charter school law as it currently exists, our board had to review the petition for another KIPP school in our district, the KIPP Elementary School, with their intent to serve the Bayview area.

05:09:26.320 --> 05:09:46.215
Within those narrow constraints, our board did make some findings with concern to student discipline issues in their current schools and their ability to carry out the kind of educational program we'd like to see for those children.

05:09:49.028 --> 05:10:01.396
The CDE staff echoed some of those same concerns and made additional findings about the finances of the school.

05:10:02.496 --> 05:10:12.983
So when we were here for the Advisory Commission for Charter Schools, the recommendation from the CDE staff was denial of the petition.

05:10:14.469 --> 05:10:20.212
The advisory commission listened to what both sides had to say.

05:10:20.972 --> 05:10:26.455
From what I can tell, there was not a consideration of the CDE staff recommendation.

05:10:26.815 --> 05:10:31.797
The vote was whether or not to approve or recommend that you approve the petition.

05:10:34.182 --> 05:10:37.764
So, we made findings at the local level.

05:10:39.345 --> 05:10:42.667
We present those findings to the petitioner.

05:10:42.767 --> 05:10:50.473
The petitioner gave some response but did not really amend the petition to address all of our concerns.

05:10:51.433 --> 05:11:01.200
At CDE staff level, there were findings to support denying the petition and then clarifications were made to

05:11:02.273 --> 05:11:06.714
changed the recommendation from CDE staff to approve the petition.

05:11:07.854 --> 05:11:21.517
So where we are is that if you approve this petition, there will be a KIPP elementary school in San Francisco Unified.

05:11:23.677 --> 05:11:28.838
San Francisco Unified has many members, or

05:11:30.448 --> 05:11:33.850
community members that you will hear from that don't support the school.

05:11:34.130 --> 05:11:36.953
As you can see, there are many people that do support the school.

05:11:38.094 --> 05:11:50.864
If you approve it, we will be in the position of having our local board working with a school that we did not approve, but we will do that.

05:11:51.516 --> 05:12:04.082
You have to understand that they also have a Prop 39 recommendation or request in so that we will have to find a way to provide the school with facilities.

05:12:05.383 --> 05:12:19.530
As a county office, we will also have to deal with their state apportionments on a monthly basis and divert other resources to take care of administerial functions as well as

05:12:20.543 --> 05:12:33.515
having to disrupt some of the really tough work that we are doing in the Bayview area to improve the schools that we have there and make them a better choice for our students.

05:12:35.009 --> 05:12:38.612
So it's an issue of we know what the rules are.

05:12:39.032 --> 05:12:43.155
I've been here before.

05:12:43.495 --> 05:12:59.526
In the past, we've actually made findings to deny renewal of a charter school that had been operated by the state for five years and clearly was in violation of the state's rules for their financial conduct.

05:13:00.407 --> 05:13:03.409
And your board approved them anyway.

05:13:04.335 --> 05:13:11.380
only to finally see the wisdom of our board's findings and close the school one year later.

05:13:12.680 --> 05:13:24.288
But where we are is my board, the Board of Education of the San Francisco Unified School District, understands what the rules are.

05:13:24.915 --> 05:13:34.721
We believe that the rules need to be changed because there is too much of a presumption that your board will approve petitions on appeal.

05:13:35.702 --> 05:13:49.710
And we feel very strongly that our ability to control, to serve the constituents of our local community is unduly taken away under the current process.

05:13:50.631 --> 05:13:54.413
And so we will, if you approve the petition,

05:13:55.638 --> 05:14:10.554
I have to work with KIPP on facilities and other issues and go from there and hope that the state board oversight will make sure that things are done in a way that will benefit San Francisco.

05:14:12.642 --> 05:14:12.962
Thank you.

05:14:14.003 --> 05:14:16.864
Okay, we're now ready for the public comment.

05:14:17.044 --> 05:14:17.845
One minute each.

05:14:17.965 --> 05:14:24.328
Please introduce yourself and if you represent somebody or some organization, state that as well.

05:14:24.868 --> 05:14:25.869
So let's have the list.

05:14:27.375 --> 05:14:30.717
For item number five, would the following speakers please line up?

05:14:31.277 --> 05:14:50.970
Michael Flores-Castaneda, Claire Crawford, Bishop Chris Baker, Mike Hutchison, Elida Fisher, Adrienne Adamichikova, Melissa Dar Carvajal, Allison Collins, Tracy Brown, Jewel Roberts-Plung,

05:14:51.850 --> 05:15:03.118
Anna Keller, Rosalyn Taylor, Marie Huxley, Beth Thompson, Shanti Reed, and I will come back with the next 20.

05:15:08.342 --> 05:15:08.702
Go ahead.

05:15:09.312 --> 05:15:10.372
Thank you.

05:15:10.492 --> 05:15:11.533
My name is Claire Crawford.

05:15:11.553 --> 05:15:12.853
I'm within the public interest.

05:15:13.554 --> 05:15:19.996
As you know, this is the first of six charter petition appeals before you today after sound decisions by local school boards.

05:15:20.856 --> 05:15:29.499
In January, prior to the last SBE meeting, we shared with you our analysis of this board's tendency to overturn local and county board decisions to deny deficient petitions.

05:15:30.059 --> 05:15:36.982
At that time, the SBE had approved 71% of petitions denied at the local level and fully one third of those schools were not open.

05:15:37.762 --> 05:15:42.983
In the short time between January and now, yet another SBE-approved school, Paramount Collegiate Academy, failed.

05:15:43.563 --> 05:15:46.084
Shut down mid-year with virtually no notice to students.

05:15:46.884 --> 05:15:49.165
Students were sent scrambling to find a new school.

05:15:49.945 --> 05:15:52.985
The warning signs were there from the local and county boards of education.

05:15:53.586 --> 05:15:59.247
I urge you to be judicious in considering the decisions of the local elected bodies in the six petitions before you.

05:15:59.467 --> 05:15:59.707
Thank you.

05:16:04.332 --> 05:16:05.293
Good afternoon, board.

05:16:05.753 --> 05:16:06.834
I'm Bishop Chris Baker.

05:16:06.854 --> 05:16:08.995
And I'm going to stand and let you know why I'm here.

05:16:09.415 --> 05:16:21.243
As a single parent of an African-American boy from 18 months to 24 years old, getting ready to graduate from college with honors, going to a undergraduate after this.

05:16:21.603 --> 05:16:22.924
And I'll tell you why.

05:16:23.024 --> 05:16:26.086
Because I chose to put him in a charter.

05:16:26.146 --> 05:16:28.488
The charter did not come looking for me.

05:16:28.608 --> 05:16:31.390
I went to look for a charter to have better options.

05:16:31.890 --> 05:16:37.851
I chose that, and when I see the success of what these schools are doing for kids, I support it.

05:16:38.091 --> 05:16:43.252
The only problem I have is why do we always focus on the negative?

05:16:43.572 --> 05:16:51.194
If we continue to focus on the positive, we can achieve what we need to achieve and look at the other mechanism and bring that along.

05:16:51.254 --> 05:16:57.115
So I solely support this, and I ask each and every one of you to look at your hearts and your minds

05:16:57.475 --> 05:16:59.297
and support this and honor it.

05:16:59.537 --> 05:17:01.659
And let's watch our kids grow.

05:17:01.699 --> 05:17:04.803
So when you're in the grocery store, you're in the grocery store.

05:17:04.843 --> 05:17:07.525
You can feel good about what you approve.

05:17:07.766 --> 05:17:08.146
Thank you.

05:17:14.673 --> 05:17:17.896
Rosalyn Taylor, Eastside Teachers Association, San Jose.

05:17:18.036 --> 05:17:19.698
Yielding my time to Allison Collins.

05:17:23.482 --> 05:17:29.719
Kevin Murphy, Parent & Salse, ceding my time to Allison Collins.

05:17:31.820 --> 05:17:54.570
Hello, my name is Allison Collins and I'm a black parent in San Francisco Unified and I'm a very involved member of the African American Parent Advisory Council and I've been working for the past several years with black families across our district to help elevate voices of parents in our schools and make sure that they have a seat at the table when it comes to decision making in our district.

05:17:56.231 --> 05:17:58.312
I want to talk to you about another school.

05:17:58.872 --> 05:18:01.434
It's Dr. George Washington Carver Elementary.

05:18:02.014 --> 05:18:09.939
Several years ago, I met with families there and they were concerned because their building was not

05:18:10.739 --> 05:18:14.622
the way that they felt it should be, and we worked together to elevate their voices.

05:18:15.042 --> 05:18:23.589
They came to the board, and the district responded, and it did a $1.9 million redesign, which recently opened this fall.

05:18:24.089 --> 05:18:25.410
Families told me that they were crying.

05:18:25.430 --> 05:18:30.634
They were so happy to have what they consider a new school in the Bayview.

05:18:31.874 --> 05:18:34.877
As a community, the Carver Village is an amazing community.

05:18:34.917 --> 05:18:37.339
They offer wellness programs, things like that.

05:18:38.519 --> 05:18:54.771
What is concerning for black families that I'm talking to and specifically Carver families, I support families in choosing schools and I support them being involved, but I have two extra people who have ceded their time.

05:18:55.672 --> 05:19:16.731
Okay and they are expressing to me that they are concerned because Kipp Elementary is saying that they want to have their new school in Dr. George Washington Carver's new school and for them to co-locate in that school would mean that they would have to push out vital resources that are necessary for their community.

05:19:17.071 --> 05:19:20.034
They have 9% of their students are homeless and

05:19:20.274 --> 05:19:24.456
and they also have a high level of students that face trauma and things like that in the Bayview.

05:19:24.876 --> 05:19:32.419
So a lot of these resource rooms that they provide outside of classrooms are for quiet spaces for students who are experiencing trauma.

05:19:32.799 --> 05:19:40.042
They have social workers and wellness centers and science rooms and a computer lab for kids who we know don't have as much access to technology.

05:19:40.502 --> 05:19:44.744
They are extremely concerned about KIPP moving into their school.

05:19:45.164 --> 05:19:47.705
I support families in having a voice in their school

05:19:47.785 --> 05:19:48.886
You've had extra time.

05:19:49.006 --> 05:19:57.493
I hope that you give Carver families a voice in also who is in their school that they've worked so hard to fight for.

05:19:57.733 --> 05:19:58.533
Thank you very much.

05:19:59.474 --> 05:19:59.754
Yeah.

05:19:59.814 --> 05:20:01.476
Now I want to restate our rules.

05:20:01.536 --> 05:20:04.938
We do not allow in these charter hearings seating of time.

05:20:05.019 --> 05:20:06.840
So each person has one minute.

05:20:11.212 --> 05:20:12.773
Okay, then I will talk very fast.

05:20:12.973 --> 05:20:14.133
My name is Alita Fisher.

05:20:14.193 --> 05:20:17.955
I'm the chair of the Community Advisory Committee for Special Education and SFUSD.

05:20:18.455 --> 05:20:25.259
I'm not here to talk in my capacity as CAC chair, but I am bringing a copy of our charter position statement for you all.

05:20:25.399 --> 05:20:26.039
I'll leave it here.

05:20:27.580 --> 05:20:31.241
I'm the adoptive parent of four African American children out of foster care.

05:20:32.122 --> 05:20:34.543
My oldest is a senior at Mission High School.

05:20:35.223 --> 05:20:38.625
When she joined our family at age four, she had such severe

05:20:39.185 --> 05:20:47.109
separation anxiety due to trauma in her life that I could not... I had to be next to her at her bed when she fell asleep.

05:20:47.609 --> 05:20:50.831
And now she's a thriving senior graduating in June.

05:20:51.311 --> 05:20:53.512
She's been accepted to multiple state universities.

05:20:53.592 --> 05:21:01.556
She's deciding whether she wants to go to San Jose State or whether she wants to go to a small Division III college back in Maryland so she can play basketball.

05:21:02.336 --> 05:21:14.182
Now, all of this is because of the wraparound services provided to her in her various schools that will be pushed out if resources are removed from SFUSD and allocated to charter schools.

05:21:14.882 --> 05:21:18.043
Our children deserve the support and services they need.

05:21:18.884 --> 05:21:20.184
Are we rubber stamps here?

05:21:20.204 --> 05:21:27.027
Is the power of the pen mightier than the power of the sword, or is the power of the rubber stamp the mightiest of them all?

05:21:27.868 --> 05:21:28.188
Thank you.

05:21:32.386 --> 05:21:34.328
Hello, my name is Arianne Adamchikova.

05:21:34.488 --> 05:21:37.370
I would love to be able to make my statement in Spanish.

05:21:37.430 --> 05:21:41.274
Is there somebody that would be able to translate me back into English for the audience?

05:21:42.835 --> 05:21:48.800
I understand, but I have people in San Francisco that are watching me, and they do not have translation headsets.

05:21:50.461 --> 05:21:51.402
You have a translator.

05:21:52.483 --> 05:21:52.703
Yes.

05:21:56.823 --> 05:21:59.005
You have two minutes since its translation.

05:21:59.405 --> 05:21:59.625
Okay.

05:22:00.105 --> 05:22:00.326
Bueno.

05:22:00.466 --> 05:22:02.127
Me llamo Arianne Adamchikova.

05:22:02.167 --> 05:22:03.708
Soy una ma... My name is... Okay.

05:22:04.228 --> 05:22:04.468
Okay.

05:22:04.609 --> 05:22:07.270
And so I say one sentence and you... Okay.

05:22:08.031 --> 05:22:08.251
Bueno.

05:22:08.391 --> 05:22:10.393
Soy una madre de San Francisco.

05:22:10.613 --> 05:22:12.134
I am a mother of San Francisco.

05:22:12.354 --> 05:22:13.895
Are you going to say it at the same time as I do?

05:22:14.275 --> 05:22:16.857
So I say it one minute and then she says it one minute.

05:22:16.997 --> 05:22:18.298
Or are we going to do... Right?

05:22:18.318 --> 05:22:19.659
Two minutes total for this.

05:22:20.119 --> 05:22:20.860
Please proceed.

05:22:20.880 --> 05:22:21.961
You have two minutes total.

05:22:22.401 --> 05:22:24.061
Okay, so don't talk at the same time, okay.

05:22:24.742 --> 05:22:30.943
Bueno, entonces soy una madre de un estudiante en la escuela Everett de San Francisco, perdón.

05:22:31.443 --> 05:22:51.208
Entonces, como madre de un estudiante y también como maestra de los hispanohablantes recién llegados de países de violencia y mucha guerra de Centroamérica, yo sé muy, muy bien las necesidades de los recién llegados que ellos llevan cuando entran en nuestras escuelas.

05:22:51.588 --> 05:23:00.811
Nuestras escuelas públicas ofrecen muchos servicios y mucho programas de empoderamiento para los padres.

05:23:01.951 --> 05:23:07.753
Entonces, necesitamos nuestras escuelas públicas que son abiertas para todos.

05:23:08.033 --> 05:23:16.016
Estos estudiantes llegan todo el año, llegan con trauma, llegan años y años atrás en cuanto a la académica.

05:23:17.276 --> 05:23:19.037
Time in Spanish, yeah.

05:23:49.596 --> 05:24:00.718
I am a parent of a 13-year student and I have been an active parent volunteer for the last eight and a half years that my son has been in that district.

05:24:01.158 --> 05:24:11.961
I also have 16 years experience as a Spanish teacher, Japanese teacher and a newcomer teacher for Central America with limited

05:24:13.001 --> 05:24:17.082
people that are interrupted, formal education.

05:24:17.782 --> 05:24:30.385
As a parent at my son's school, I have had a brilliant opportunity to get to know the diverse indigenous American communities that attend and thrive at our local public schools.

05:24:31.205 --> 05:24:42.428
I have worked with families and students who speak Mon, K'iche, Ka'chikel, Mixteco, Zapotec, and Naxatuan.

05:24:45.543 --> 05:24:55.512
KIPP is forcing a school into our district that will not be able to serve the needs of our immigrant and refugee students.

05:24:56.473 --> 05:25:06.623
It is incredibly important to me as a parent and teacher and human being that all of our students and families are blessed with the ability to get to know each other

05:25:07.083 --> 05:25:19.129
learn together and become lifelong friends on our local schools like Everett, Marshall, MEC, Fairmont, and many others serve new come youth from other countries.

05:25:19.829 --> 05:25:25.472
They come as refugees through the year at the moment of their arrival to our cities.

05:25:26.013 --> 05:25:31.315
However, like the Spanish colonialists that came over 500 years ago,

05:25:33.376 --> 05:25:34.357
with an agenda.

05:25:34.997 --> 05:25:39.818
KIPP charter schools are coming to colonize and take over our local community schools.

05:25:40.098 --> 05:25:41.159
We are public schools.

05:25:41.359 --> 05:25:49.382
We support inclusion of all our students no matter what trauma or disabilities or problems they bring to us.

05:25:50.542 --> 05:25:51.302
Thank you very much.

05:25:57.685 --> 05:25:59.226
Hi, my name is Tracy Gallardo.

05:25:59.266 --> 05:26:01.007
I'll do my own translation after.

05:26:01.027 --> 05:26:08.590
I was here to read a statement from Siobhan Walton, our board president, who denied the KIPP charter.

05:26:08.911 --> 05:26:19.236
And I want to actually talk, because I've worked years, 25 years, voting in or getting people elected that represent us, my community, Latinos, African-American.

05:26:19.716 --> 05:26:26.538
We've worked hard to get Board of Ed members to carry our voice so that they can be there showing us, representing us.

05:26:26.658 --> 05:26:27.519
I'm a teen mother.

05:26:27.579 --> 05:26:28.559
I'm a mother of four.

05:26:29.800 --> 05:26:33.281
I attended three of San Francisco's failing schools, and here I am.

05:26:33.441 --> 05:26:35.302
I rise, and so do other students.

05:26:35.402 --> 05:26:39.463
I can tell you hundreds of success stories that we have, just like they can.

05:26:39.803 --> 05:26:44.825
My community, the Latino community, came out against KIPP, located in our newcomer school.

05:26:45.385 --> 05:26:51.148
The Prop 39 space allocation will take sweet, precious space from our newcomer students.

05:26:51.568 --> 05:26:54.330
The Latino community has come out against it.

05:26:54.670 --> 05:27:01.213
We couldn't afford a bus to bring our students here, but we're here today to tell you that it will be a hardship.

05:27:01.593 --> 05:27:10.338
Mi nombre es Tracy Brown Gallardo y estoy aqui para decir que no estoy en acuerdo con esto, lo que esta pasando.

05:27:11.158 --> 05:27:29.817
los programas de newcomer en el mission education center no deben que quitar espacio para este nuevo programa no es gusto los los niños necesitan servicios no pueden compartir un edificio porque todos los cuartos están usado para servir los los niños

05:27:30.177 --> 05:27:47.155
y estamos aquí unidos como latinos no podían pagar un bus para llegar aquí no tenemos suficiente fondos así para eso y así es que ahorita están dando espacio para esta escuela y le va a quitar espacio de nuestros estudiantes y por eso estoy aquí

05:27:48.036 --> 05:27:48.757
Here we are with uh

05:28:10.683 --> 05:28:11.983
My name is Julie Roberts-Fong.

05:28:12.003 --> 05:28:16.385
I'm a parent at Redding Elementary, which is an excellent public school in San Francisco's Tenderloin.

05:28:16.425 --> 05:28:19.445
We're one of the first schools that a lot of newcomer families come to in the city.

05:28:20.065 --> 05:28:23.406
Over 80% of our families are low-income families.

05:28:23.826 --> 05:28:26.287
Over 75% speak another language at home.

05:28:27.007 --> 05:28:28.168
We have 25 languages spoken.

05:28:28.308 --> 05:28:36.830
And right now I'm missing a school site council meeting where our families are trying to decide whether or not we will have a split class or whether we'll take away a computer teacher.

05:28:37.510 --> 05:28:45.512
And the reason that that's happening is because KIPP tells our fourth and fifth graders that they need to apply early in order to get into sixth grade to avoid some kind of test.

05:28:46.433 --> 05:28:52.354
So I want to speak up for the impact that having unaccountable charter schools has on our excellent public schools, and I'm not alone.

05:28:52.895 --> 05:29:01.077
I've been talking with families from MEC and from Carter, which will be damaged by a co-location, a potential co-location, or by having another school in their neighborhood.

05:29:01.698 --> 05:29:08.576
And we have, just over the past week, over 400 signatures that have been gathered in the community opposing this charter school from opening.

05:29:09.218 --> 05:29:09.479
Thank you.

05:29:14.537 --> 05:29:17.680
Hi, I'm Mike Hutchinson, a proud graduate of Oakland Public Schools.

05:29:17.760 --> 05:29:27.410
I'm also the founder of the Oakland Public Education Network and a founding member of the Journey for Justice National Alliance, a national alliance of black and brown-led grassroots organizations organizing across the country.

05:29:28.792 --> 05:29:34.438
We stand with the NAACP and Black Lives Matter in calling for a moratorium on charter schools and school privatization.

05:29:35.387 --> 05:29:45.817
were actually offended by this process, that there would be an appointed board of the state that thinks it is their right and their authority to overturn the decisions unanimously made by local communities.

05:29:46.578 --> 05:29:50.161
This has been a longstanding problem, and hopefully at some point we're going to see an end to it.

05:29:50.922 --> 05:29:53.784
Oakland has the highest rate of charter schools in the state of California.

05:29:54.204 --> 05:30:05.970
It's had a devastating effect on our community, including during the 2017 school year, three rounds of mid-year cuts totaling $15 million, and I'm going to be racing home later for another discussion about school closures.

05:30:06.850 --> 05:30:08.591
We need to do much better than this.

05:30:09.592 --> 05:30:13.934
I would expect people serving in this position to want to do much better than this.

05:30:14.855 --> 05:30:20.920
If we have people coming into our communities who want to work with our schools, then let them do it under the public school umbrella.

05:30:21.240 --> 05:30:25.323
But charter schools are not public schools, and please respect our local communities.

05:30:28.200 --> 05:30:36.807
Good afternoon, Michael Flores Castaneda with California Teachers Association, here to let you know that CTA is strongly opposed to overturning the decision of the local and county school board, or local and county boards.

05:30:37.367 --> 05:30:55.402
With one in ten California students currently enrolled in charter schools, with 22 charter schools currently under the state board authorization, and another six on the agenda for this afternoon, with a potential 30 percent increase, the board needs to closely examine each appeal mindfully and carefully, especially in this case where there's any lack of real parent interest.

05:30:56.483 --> 05:31:02.831
What happens with the remaining students within the district when facilities and resources are allocated now to students outside of the district?

05:31:03.452 --> 05:31:11.302
We've heard it all day long, local control is the California way, but overturning the LEA and the district or the county board decisions is not a local control.

05:31:11.362 --> 05:31:12.283
Please respect their wishes.

05:31:12.443 --> 05:31:12.704
Thank you.

05:31:17.608 --> 05:31:21.870
Good afternoon members of the State Board of Education CDE staff.

05:31:22.430 --> 05:31:29.352
My name is Marie Kawase Huxley and I'm the Chief of Schools for KIPP Bay Area Schools Public Schools.

05:31:30.172 --> 05:31:39.896
I'm here today to ask that you approve our charter for KIPP Bayview Elementary School so that we can respond to the needs and desires of the Bayview community.

05:31:40.936 --> 05:31:47.358
We are proud to have educated San Francisco students in Bayview Hunters Point since 2003.

05:31:48.278 --> 05:31:59.022
And our proposal to open an elementary school in the neighborhood represents our continued commitment to the community and to the families who have asked for more school options.

05:32:00.002 --> 05:32:09.686
We propose to launch an elementary school in the Bayview where all students learn and grow in a healthy, joyful, and safe environment.

05:32:10.726 --> 05:32:18.476
We have a strong elementary school program that consists of rigorous curriculum, social-emotional learning, and restorative practices.

05:32:19.657 --> 05:32:26.065
Thank you for your careful consideration of our charter petition and for your service on behalf of California students.

05:32:33.047 --> 05:32:37.553
Good afternoon, I'm Beth Thompson, the founder and CEO of KIPP Bay Area Schools.

05:32:38.034 --> 05:32:47.046
We greatly value having been part of the Bayview Hunters Point community for the past 15 years and offering a high quality middle and high school program.

05:32:48.027 --> 05:32:56.853
We are committed to holding ourselves to the highest standard of transparency and excellence when it comes to our academic, financial, and operational outcomes.

05:32:57.534 --> 05:33:01.216
Kit Bay Area Schools is a locally governed nonprofit organization.

05:33:01.736 --> 05:33:10.402
We adhere to the Political Reform Act, the Brown Act, the Public Records Act, and have a conflict of interest code approved by the Fair Political Practices Commission.

05:33:11.383 --> 05:33:21.858
On behalf of all of our current and future families in the Bayview, many of whom have been asking for this school for several years, I respectfully urge you to approve our petition.

05:33:22.178 --> 05:33:22.539
Thank you.

05:33:24.366 --> 05:33:25.767
Please excuse the interruption.

05:33:25.827 --> 05:33:27.767
Will the following speakers please line up?

05:33:27.947 --> 05:33:50.196
Lenore Crawford, Pastor Walker, Den Hernandez, Eliza Rodriguez, Timothy Demery, Jelena Wright, Rosa Gonzalez, Luz Torres, Robrina Parker, Geraldine Anderson, Raven Campbell, Karina Hernandez, Ricardo Hernandez, Jacqueline Reyes, Andrea Evans, Carla Vasquez.

05:33:53.851 --> 05:33:55.792
Good afternoon, board members.

05:33:56.172 --> 05:33:57.433
My name is Shante Reed.

05:33:57.673 --> 05:34:01.235
I am the founding operations manager for Kipp Bayview Elementary.

05:34:01.955 --> 05:34:07.518
Real change in education is a grassroots effort in communities and schools across all of San Francisco.

05:34:08.178 --> 05:34:16.883
Our efforts are a reflection of the choices parents make in deciding where their students have an opportunity to go to school and ultimately the future of their children.

05:34:17.423 --> 05:34:22.806
Without educational options for families, we limit the type of diverse experiences and lives

05:34:23.146 --> 05:34:24.887
our families and communities could have.

05:34:25.548 --> 05:34:35.394
Equity and access to quality education is not a cliche, but it is a call to action that we intend to provide for our parents and families in the Bayview-Hunters Point community.

05:34:35.994 --> 05:34:43.199
Our efforts to retain students in the Bayview-Hunters Point community is demonstrated through our community of practice.

05:34:43.519 --> 05:34:51.845
That community of practice includes meeting with our parent design team, partnering with preschools and daycares and existing elementary schools in the community,

05:34:52.305 --> 05:34:53.768
to move forward that effort.

05:34:54.049 --> 05:34:58.778
Our goal is to build a community school and not a school that resides within the community.

05:34:59.079 --> 05:35:01.243
We do hope that you do consider our petition on today.

05:35:01.404 --> 05:35:01.724
Thank you.

05:35:06.033 --> 05:35:08.355
Hi, Ona Keller with the California Teachers Association.

05:35:08.855 --> 05:35:12.358
In Kip's presentation, they talked about wanting to have a sense of belonging.

05:35:12.579 --> 05:35:20.185
And I think a lot of that is the community that makes up a school, the teachers and the counselors, the administrators, who are all there as caring adults to help these kids.

05:35:21.366 --> 05:35:29.413
But you have to wonder, when Kip has only 25% of their staff have clear credentials in 17-18, they have an average of two years of teaching experience.

05:35:29.893 --> 05:35:36.575
that what is KIPP doing that is not attracting highly qualified teachers who have clear credentials, who have experience in the classroom?

05:35:36.915 --> 05:35:37.816
Why aren't they staying?

05:35:38.216 --> 05:35:39.997
Why aren't they able to attract teachers of color?

05:35:40.677 --> 05:35:46.839
Their Bayview school in 2014-15, according to EdData, had zero black teachers and two-thirds of their teachers were white.

05:35:47.760 --> 05:35:55.587
There's something wrong when a school can't attract folks from the community to be there, to be part of the school, to be teachers, to be counselors, to be the librarians.

05:35:56.628 --> 05:36:03.233
And so I would really question whether or not that sense of belonging is possible without people who are committed to staying at the school for the long term.

05:36:03.434 --> 05:36:03.694
Thank you.

05:36:07.725 --> 05:36:08.725
Good afternoon, board.

05:36:08.866 --> 05:36:14.008
My name is Lenore Crawford and I am a mother of four and I am a Bayview resident.

05:36:14.168 --> 05:36:18.350
Two of my children have gone through the KIPP schools and both are successful in college.

05:36:18.670 --> 05:36:22.672
I am here to speak for my grandson who will be entering kindergarten in the fall of 2018.

05:36:23.312 --> 05:36:30.215
I don't know if you've ever gone through the school board process to get your children into a school that has academic excellence.

05:36:30.315 --> 05:36:31.035
It's a nightmare.

05:36:31.335 --> 05:36:37.118
So I am petitioning and pleading with the board to give us parents, an active parent, school choice,

05:36:37.478 --> 05:36:42.543
and to be able to decide if we want to send our KIPP where our tax dollars go for the public schools.

05:36:43.083 --> 05:36:46.667
And prior in elementary school, I paid private schools for my kids.

05:36:46.827 --> 05:36:52.152
And then when KIPP came into the picture, I was so thrilled because I didn't have to come out of my pocket to pay

05:36:52.512 --> 05:36:54.474
for a private school for my children.

05:36:54.714 --> 05:36:55.916
Thank you for this opportunity.

05:36:55.936 --> 05:37:01.261
I petition you, please, to give us a consideration because KIPP brings Bill's character.

05:37:02.022 --> 05:37:03.944
It helps them to have life skills.

05:37:04.264 --> 05:37:10.250
Other than the strong academic performances, my son got a full scholarship to a college and my daughter is doing very well.

05:37:10.310 --> 05:37:11.111
Thank you, board.

05:37:15.194 --> 05:37:21.642
Honorable Board Members, I am Dr. Relius Walker, a pastor of the True Hope Church of God in Christ in San Francisco.

05:37:22.343 --> 05:37:29.251
The True Hope Church in Bayview-Hunters Point stands as a beacon of light for approximately 50 years, improving

05:37:30.075 --> 05:37:35.623
the community and housing, jobs, health and wellness and quality education.

05:37:35.643 --> 05:37:43.994
The church has assisted several over the years to finish universities in this state and also traditional black colleges.

05:37:44.435 --> 05:37:47.519
God, there is a crisis in education.

05:37:48.019 --> 05:37:52.423
and African-American, Latinos, and Pacific Islanders in San Francisco.

05:37:53.423 --> 05:38:00.309
We must rise to meet this challenge today, and I believe you board members can meet that particular challenge.

05:38:00.329 --> 05:38:01.950
We must leave here today

05:38:02.594 --> 05:38:07.799
and hopefully you will leave here by approving this particular charter.

05:38:08.280 --> 05:38:21.813
I also have a resolution from my board members of my development corporation made up of about 10 churches that also sent a resolution asking you to approve this charter today.

05:38:22.013 --> 05:38:22.494
Thanks very much.

05:38:28.669 --> 05:38:32.371
Hola, me llamo Rosa y soy residente de la comunidad de Bayview.

05:38:32.511 --> 05:38:36.492
Estoy presente porque estoy abogando por la escuela Key Bayview Elementary.

05:38:36.893 --> 05:38:41.074
Ahorita mi hija Ashley va a Key Bayview Academy y está en el quinto grado.

05:38:41.414 --> 05:38:48.898
Yo he visto que desde que entró a Key, ella se ha enfocado mucho en su estudio y su interés en la universidad ha crecido.

05:38:49.258 --> 05:38:54.220
Yo creo que este cambio ha sido porque en Key Bayview Academy le dan tarea de lunes a domingo

05:38:54.580 --> 05:38:58.262
y empujan a los estudiantes que sobresalgan académicamente.

05:38:58.642 --> 05:39:05.526
Antes, cuando mi hija iba a Bred Hart, nomás tenía tarea de lunes a jueves y no sentía esa presión para mejorar.

05:39:05.946 --> 05:39:13.070
Estoy muy satisfecha con el crecimiento de Ashley, y eso me motiva a poner a mi hijo Joseph en Keep Bayview Elementary.

05:39:13.450 --> 05:39:18.273
Yo me di cuenta que Keep iba a abrir una nueva primaria cuando vi que tenían una mesa

05:39:18.693 --> 05:39:23.517
en un evento comunitario que se llama Resilient Bay View Neighborhoods en Octubre.

05:39:23.557 --> 05:39:25.278
Por favor, aprueben esta escuela.

05:39:27.967 --> 05:39:29.308
Hello, my name is Rose Stein.

05:39:29.368 --> 05:39:32.129
I am a resident of the community, Bayview.

05:39:33.690 --> 05:39:41.593
I am present because I want to advocate for the KIPP School, Bayview Elementary.

05:39:42.494 --> 05:39:49.057
Right now, my daughter, Ashley, goes to KIPP Bayview Academy, and she is in the fifth grade.

05:39:49.937 --> 05:39:57.161
I have seen how KIPP has helped her focus in school and in her studies.

05:40:00.100 --> 05:40:02.401
and her interest in going to a university.

05:40:06.202 --> 05:40:16.585
This change that KIPP Preview Academy has done and it's going to bring a lot of good to our community.

05:40:17.145 --> 05:40:20.346
She receives homework from Monday to Sunday

05:40:23.180 --> 05:40:26.864
and pushes the students academically.

05:40:27.665 --> 05:40:30.968
Before my daughter used to go went to Bret Hart.

05:40:32.050 --> 05:40:37.996
She only had homework from Monday to Thursday and she didn't feel that push.

05:40:39.538 --> 05:40:40.659
I'm very satisfied.

05:40:43.860 --> 05:40:46.061
with the growth of Ashley.

05:40:47.661 --> 05:40:56.143
And that motivates to put my son Joseph in the KIPP Bayview Elementary.

05:40:58.544 --> 05:41:08.467
I noticed that KIPP was going to have another school because of a booth that was

05:41:10.956 --> 05:41:14.081
because of an event, a booth that the community had.

05:41:16.084 --> 05:41:22.735
The name is Resolent Payview Neighbor Fest in October.

05:41:24.277 --> 05:41:26.080
Please approve this school.

05:41:34.833 --> 05:41:42.381
Hola, me llamo Luz y vengo a esta tarde para demostrar mi apoyo para la escuela Kid Bay Elementary en mi comunidad.

05:41:45.103 --> 05:41:53.552
Cuando mi familia se cambió de Los Angeles a San Francisco, yo estaba viendo una escuela de alta calidad para mis hijos, Kevin y Melanie.

05:41:54.102 --> 05:42:00.944
When my family moved from L.A., I was looking for a good school for my kids, Kevin and Melanie.

05:42:01.425 --> 05:42:05.466
In Los Angeles, my son went to KIPP Comienza and he was very happy.

05:42:24.053 --> 05:42:33.110
with the high academic expectivities and the focus

05:42:35.575 --> 05:42:40.877
So when I moved to San Francisco, I looked for a similar school like KIPP, but I couldn't find one.

05:42:40.917 --> 05:42:41.597
When I put Kevin

05:42:56.972 --> 05:43:08.161
in Leonard Fillon Elementary School, his grades went down very much before he was very well in school.

05:43:20.347 --> 05:43:30.693
My own son states that with KIPP, it was very different.

05:43:31.294 --> 05:43:34.376
The subjects were very different, and the teachers would push them.

05:43:34.896 --> 05:43:39.319
Next year, my daughter Melanie will be in first grade, and I want her to start KIPP.

05:43:39.339 --> 05:43:39.519
Thank you.

05:43:55.868 --> 05:43:56.528
Good afternoon.

05:43:56.588 --> 05:44:00.311
My name is Jelena Wright and I have lived in the Bayview for the last 10 years.

05:44:00.731 --> 05:44:02.092
The Bayview is changing a lot.

05:44:02.512 --> 05:44:08.016
I love to see the diversity in the community and I really don't like how people are getting pushed out of our community.

05:44:08.456 --> 05:44:12.999
I'm speaking because I want my daughter to go to school, to go to a good school close to home.

05:44:13.459 --> 05:44:16.842
I want her to get the education all kids of color deserve.

05:44:17.262 --> 05:44:23.146
I think it is important for my daughter Taraji to go to school with kids that look like her and that want to succeed.

05:44:23.266 --> 05:44:23.586
Thank you.

05:44:30.803 --> 05:44:31.704
Good afternoon, board.

05:44:32.224 --> 05:44:33.245
My name is Timothy Demery.

05:44:33.485 --> 05:44:43.352
I'm here as a parent, an educator, a person with deep roots in the Bay Area, as well as a community engagement team member supporting Bayview Elementary.

05:44:43.812 --> 05:44:45.313
I came here prepared with testimony.

05:44:45.634 --> 05:44:48.235
However, a parent who couldn't make it today told me to read this.

05:44:48.756 --> 05:44:50.017
My name is Lovely Wilson.

05:44:50.137 --> 05:44:51.298
I'm a proud mother of four.

05:44:51.558 --> 05:44:55.721
I would like to express my love, passion, and share how thankful I am for KIPP San Francisco.

05:44:56.421 --> 05:45:00.405
The passion and engagement that the staff has toward families is amazing.

05:45:00.766 --> 05:45:07.072
What stands out the most is the communication between the parents, which allows me, as a working parent, to stay connected at all times.

05:45:07.532 --> 05:45:14.339
My hope is that my youngest two, three and five years old, have an opportunity to experience what KIPP has to offer at an earlier age.

05:45:14.839 --> 05:45:19.582
I believe in my heart that KIPP would surpass my expectations when the elementary school is approved.

05:45:19.982 --> 05:45:23.405
I need KIPP, our children need KIPP, and my community needs KIPP.

05:45:23.905 --> 05:45:32.511
We need quality teachers and staff, we need a structured learning environment, and we need you all today to approve KIPP because it would be the best investment you would make in my community.

05:45:32.771 --> 05:45:33.051
Thank you.

05:45:38.394 --> 05:45:39.055
Good afternoon, board.

05:45:40.140 --> 05:45:41.381
My name is Ricardo Hernandez.

05:45:41.601 --> 05:45:46.203
I attend Archbishop Riordan High School in San Francisco, which is an all-boys Catholic school.

05:45:48.024 --> 05:45:50.845
I went to Kid Baby Academy, and they gave me the tools I used to succeed.

05:45:51.225 --> 05:46:01.530
I wouldn't be able to get up early without problems, sit up straight in class, read and write at a college level, and solve math problems without problems, without the KIPP curriculum and the dedicated teachers.

05:46:02.050 --> 05:46:08.353
I want all the children in my community of Babies Hunters Point of San Francisco to have the option of going to elementary school

05:46:10.020 --> 05:46:14.427
middle school and high school with the same values and college prep techniques.

05:46:14.828 --> 05:46:23.321
You as the State Board of Education passing this charter can validate my desire for a distinguished education for the deserving children of my community.

05:46:23.561 --> 05:46:23.822
Thank you.

05:46:30.336 --> 05:46:31.258
Good afternoon, board.

05:46:31.278 --> 05:46:32.581
My name is Dina Hernandez.

05:46:32.601 --> 05:46:34.846
That was my son, Ricardo, that was just speaking.

05:46:35.567 --> 05:46:39.777
Kid Bayview, being a Bayview resident means a great deal.

05:46:41.997 --> 05:46:44.518
The school offers so much.

05:46:45.578 --> 05:46:52.940
I wish that there was an elementary school that would have been able to give my son the tools that he has today, starting from the beginning.

05:46:53.300 --> 05:46:55.041
He has started in Catholic school.

05:46:55.541 --> 05:46:56.361
I put him in KIPP.

05:46:56.781 --> 05:47:02.122
He did amazing things at KIPP Bayview Junior High.

05:47:02.743 --> 05:47:10.905
He goes to a Catholic school because they gave him tools that he can further himself with a different education, even being in a Catholic school.

05:47:11.725 --> 05:47:23.796
Bayview-Hunters Point deserves to have the choice for our students to be able to go to whichever school they choose, whether it's public, Catholic, charter.

05:47:24.697 --> 05:47:27.459
We as residents should have that choice.

05:47:28.780 --> 05:47:32.684
I don't understand how we have so much going on and the choice is not available.

05:47:33.484 --> 05:47:36.387
Hopefully you'll grant us Kipp Elementary.

05:47:38.626 --> 05:47:39.586
Good afternoon, board.

05:47:39.927 --> 05:47:40.667
I'm sorry.

05:47:41.027 --> 05:47:42.248
My name is Rovina Parker.

05:47:42.268 --> 05:47:44.909
I was born and raised in the Bayview.

05:47:45.449 --> 05:47:46.470
I have four children.

05:47:46.490 --> 05:47:49.732
I raised my children in the Bayview in different public schools.

05:47:50.132 --> 05:47:58.676
My last child is a product of a KIPP school, which then now is KIPP College Prep High School.

05:47:59.356 --> 05:48:06.120
She went on to graduate from KIPP and now attends Paul Quinn College.

05:48:06.620 --> 05:48:08.281
I say all that to say because

05:48:09.978 --> 05:48:13.120
Being that I live in a Bayview, that means I've seen change.

05:48:13.260 --> 05:48:14.781
Change is okay, it's good.

05:48:15.041 --> 05:48:23.926
I feel that it's unfair that we can't have the opportunity to possibly have different schools or a choice of our school.

05:48:24.386 --> 05:48:30.449
Being a grandmother also, I have a three-year-old that's growing up right now that we're looking for school.

05:48:30.789 --> 05:48:36.893
So I ask that you please, within your hearts, grant us the opportunity of the school in the Bayview.

05:48:42.642 --> 05:48:43.902
Good afternoon, Commissioners.

05:48:44.002 --> 05:48:45.703
My name is Geraldine Anderson.

05:48:45.743 --> 05:48:48.204
I live in the Bayview District of San Francisco.

05:48:48.824 --> 05:48:51.605
KIPP stands for Knowledge is Power Program.

05:48:52.225 --> 05:49:08.090
I stand here today as a parent first, registered voter, and 29-year veteran employee of City and County of San Francisco with a legal and moral obligation to ensure all the children in San Francisco have access to a world-class education.

05:49:08.690 --> 05:49:11.611
KIPP has provided that to my son who is a KIPP graduate.

05:49:12.071 --> 05:49:25.036
With data that was presented at the petition phase at the San Francisco Board of Education and the state level with the advisory commission last month I plead with you today to adopt the recommendation to approve KIPP TK to 4 elementary.

05:49:25.636 --> 05:49:35.900
Our children deserve the best and I believe KIPP has a strong educational foundation and mentorship that would last a lifetime into college, career choices and community contributions.

05:49:36.500 --> 05:49:47.879
Commissioners, let's make this positive change and make a difference in the lives of the children who we as parents would like to see graduate and lead productive lives contributing back to our society.

05:49:48.179 --> 05:49:49.081
Thank you for your time.

05:49:53.905 --> 05:49:55.867
Hello, my name is Raven Campbell.

05:49:55.967 --> 05:50:00.972
I'm a 2017 graduate of Occidental College and current employee of KIPP Area Schools.

05:50:01.532 --> 05:50:05.736
But before all of that, I was a middle school student at KIPP San Francisco Bay Academy.

05:50:05.756 --> 05:50:11.341
In elementary school, I found myself at a school where I was the only black student in my classroom.

05:50:11.721 --> 05:50:16.105
My teacher was not approachable and she did not like my inquisitiveness or imagination.

05:50:17.266 --> 05:50:26.529
And eventually, me and my mother decided it was time for a change, and I ended up at KIPP, San Francisco Bay Academy, and turns out I had lived just a few blocks away.

05:50:27.449 --> 05:50:32.191
Throughout my time at KIPP, my teachers set high expectations and held me accountable to meeting them.

05:50:32.471 --> 05:50:36.192
They challenged me academically, but most importantly, they believed in me.

05:50:37.232 --> 05:50:58.392
What a difference it would have made if I could have started there one year earlier or let alone when I was four or five years old Unfortunately, there was no KIPP elementary in San Francisco yet But now we have the opportunity to have one and students have the opportunity to start their journey to college earlier Please allow us to open KIPP in the fall.

05:50:58.693 --> 05:50:59.033
Thank you

05:51:00.774 --> 05:51:03.116
Will the last group of speakers please line up?

05:51:03.216 --> 05:51:18.165
Jasmine Johnson, Julian Vasquez-Helwig, Eric Premack, Janelle Rooley, Anna Marie Azerbaijan, Maria Hansen, Shelley Mongmember, and Kevin Murphy.

05:51:23.322 --> 05:51:24.002
Good afternoon.

05:51:24.242 --> 05:51:27.624
My name is Andra Evans and I'm vice chair of KIPP Bay Area Schools.

05:51:28.164 --> 05:51:34.527
I am very proud to have been involved with KIPP in the Bayview since we opened the first middle school 15 years ago.

05:51:35.167 --> 05:51:47.893
KIPP has proven what I've always known to be true, that the black and brown children in the Bayview are smart, resilient, and just as capable of success as their peers in more affluent parts of San Francisco.

05:51:48.773 --> 05:51:58.821
In fact, San Francisco College Prep, opened only four years ago, is already the highest performing school in the entire city for African American students.

05:51:59.301 --> 05:52:00.622
These are not just statistics.

05:52:01.042 --> 05:52:08.688
I have seen the transformation that KIPP education has personally in children's lives, and as you've heard from community members, they've seen it too.

05:52:09.308 --> 05:52:10.649
That's why we're here today.

05:52:11.130 --> 05:52:13.892
KIPP is not here asking for growth for growth's sake.

05:52:14.332 --> 05:52:19.338
We are here because parents have come to us and asked us to open an elementary school.

05:52:19.738 --> 05:52:24.924
It's the parents who are demanding a pathway from elementary school through high school.

05:52:24.984 --> 05:52:27.107
And I ask that you approve this petition today.

05:52:27.427 --> 05:52:27.808
Thank you.

05:52:32.253 --> 05:52:33.074
Hi, good afternoon.

05:52:33.114 --> 05:52:34.075
I'm going to be seating.

05:52:36.658 --> 05:52:46.943
No, okay, well, I wanted to just re, I wanted to give justice to one of our parents' writing that she wrote.

05:52:46.963 --> 05:52:51.906
I just didn't feel like the translation was well, and I just wanna respectfully repeat it in English.

05:52:52.166 --> 05:52:56.988
I speak both Spanish and English, so I just wanna make sure that I really value what she had to say.

05:52:57.068 --> 05:52:58.649
So her name's Rosa.

05:52:58.989 --> 05:53:02.331
Hi, my name is Rosa, and I am a resident of the Bayview community.

05:53:03.251 --> 05:53:06.713
I am here because I am advocating for KIPP Bayview Elementary.

05:53:07.794 --> 05:53:11.896
Right now, my daughter Ashley attends KIPP Bayview Academy, and she is in the fifth grade.

05:53:12.756 --> 05:53:19.860
I have noticed that since she entered KIPP, she has been focused much more on her studies, and her interest for the university has increased.

05:53:26.058 --> 05:53:37.064
I think that this change is due to the fact that I put her at Kid Baby U Academy because they give her homework from Monday to Sunday, and that pushes her to excel academically.

05:53:37.364 --> 05:53:40.946
While at Brett Hart, that wasn't the case.

05:53:41.026 --> 05:53:44.168
She only had homework from Monday through Thursday.

05:53:46.289 --> 05:53:49.851
She is interested in putting her child in Kit Bayview Elementary.

05:53:50.091 --> 05:53:51.372
His name is Joseph, please.

05:53:52.973 --> 05:53:54.994
Thank you for considering this story.

05:53:55.154 --> 05:53:55.435
Thank you.

05:54:01.378 --> 05:54:06.021
So I'm just going to be translating for Jacqueline, but I'm going to let her read the Spanish first.

05:54:09.016 --> 05:54:09.556
Buenas tardes.

05:54:09.616 --> 05:54:15.738
Mi nombre es Jacqueline y voy a leer un comentario escrito por mi compañera Diana Vasquez.

05:54:16.058 --> 05:54:19.259
Ella es una mamá líder como yo y no pudo asistir hoy.

05:54:21.340 --> 05:54:22.420
Hi, I'm Jacqueline.

05:54:22.820 --> 05:54:29.382
I'm going to read this commentary by Diana Vasquez who's a mother leader like myself who couldn't attend today.

05:54:30.385 --> 05:54:41.391
Soy una madre del área de la misión donde existen varias escuelas del distrito escolar y donde lamentablemente el nivel académico es mucho más bajo que otras áreas.

05:54:42.792 --> 05:54:52.937
I'm a mom that lives in the mission area of San Francisco where there exists many schools of the school district that unfortunately have an academic level that's much slower than other areas.

05:54:53.894 --> 05:55:00.361
In San Francisco we already have a middle and high school for KIPP, but the kids that come in to the KIPP schools come in very behind.

05:55:00.401 --> 05:55:03.905
And here we know that an elementary school would be much better.

05:55:17.409 --> 05:55:27.617
Yo soy madre de un niño con educación especial, y asiste en la escuela Keep San Francisco Bay, y yo veo que es una escuela con muy buenas estructuras.

05:55:28.177 --> 05:55:35.383
Mi hijo ha estado muy bien atendido hasta ahora, y aparte por la misma escuela le pusieron terapia ocupacional.

05:55:36.041 --> 05:55:41.344
I'm a mother of a child that is in a special ed program and attends KIPP SFB.

05:55:41.745 --> 05:55:44.446
And I have seen that the school has very good structures.

05:55:45.027 --> 05:55:51.431
My child has been very well attended to and has even been given occupational therapy at the same school.

05:55:52.531 --> 05:55:56.534
Why deny a new school that is for kids with a thirst for knowledge?

05:56:03.812 --> 05:56:08.759
Nosotros como padres debemos tener opciones en donde matricular a nuestros hijos.

05:56:10.000 --> 05:56:15.127
We as parents deserve to have options for our kids where they go where they want to go to school.

05:56:22.349 --> 05:56:24.911
Good afternoon board president Kirst and state board members.

05:56:25.031 --> 05:56:26.171
My name is Janelle Rooley.

05:56:26.191 --> 05:56:31.995
I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Young, Minnie, and Core here today in very strong support of Kip Bayview Elementary.

05:56:32.656 --> 05:56:40.221
We urge you to vote for approval in accordance with both the CDE staff and also the ACCS recommendations for approval.

05:56:41.401 --> 05:56:46.825
I wanted to underscore that today's decision is really only about the KIPP-Bayview charter petition itself.

05:56:47.785 --> 05:57:02.275
There have been a lot of policy considerations that have been brought up, and maybe there's a time down the road to talk about those, but today our focus is on the charter petition, which presents a sound educational program whose petitioners are demonstrably likely to successfully implement

05:57:03.055 --> 05:57:06.017
and that contains a reasonably comprehensive description of all the elements.

05:57:07.358 --> 05:57:11.821
You have heard today a very clear call for an elementary school in the Bayview.

05:57:12.281 --> 05:57:17.504
KIPP has been around in San Francisco in the Bayview for 15 years, so this is not fast growth.

05:57:18.345 --> 05:57:19.866
We understand the district's position.

05:57:20.346 --> 05:57:26.630
Nevertheless, charter schools are lawful entities with very specific statutory requirements, and we ask that you uphold those today.

05:57:26.690 --> 05:57:26.950
Thank you.

05:57:31.479 --> 05:57:32.120
Good afternoon.

05:57:32.140 --> 05:57:33.581
My name is Jasmine Johnson.

05:57:33.601 --> 05:57:36.864
I am the founding assistant principal of Kipp Bayview Elementary School.

05:57:37.364 --> 05:57:40.948
I'm going to be reading the testimony of a parent who unfortunately couldn't be here this afternoon.

05:57:42.194 --> 05:57:48.376
Hi, my name is Marisol Rosales-Silva and I have been a resident of the Bayview District in San Francisco for nine years.

05:57:48.776 --> 05:57:54.098
I have seven children ages 5 to 14 and have been a KIPP parent since 2013.

05:57:54.858 --> 05:58:07.262
I need for KIPP Bayview Elementary School to open this coming school year in the Bayview so that my children and all children in my community can receive the opportunity to have an outstanding education in a public charter setting.

05:58:07.922 --> 05:58:20.205
I have had the experience of being able to communicate and have such caring and empathetic team of teachers that will meet my children wherever they are and push them nonstop to make the level of achievement they need to.

05:58:20.745 --> 05:58:33.408
With that, I share that my children all have different ways of learning, but their teachers have worked tirelessly with them in ways that help them individually rather than teaching one particular way and allowing them to fall through the cracks.

05:58:34.028 --> 05:58:38.375
Thank you for your time and consideration for the approval of Kipp Bayview Elementary School.

05:58:45.319 --> 05:58:49.143
Hi, Julian Vasquez-Heilig, Education Chair, California NAACP.

05:58:49.764 --> 05:59:01.216
In the fall of 2016, the NAACP Board of Directors approved a national resolution calling for the moratorium on charter schools until transparency and accountability in their operations can be achieved.

05:59:01.616 --> 05:59:05.781
Following this action, the NAACP created the Task Force on High-Quality Education,

05:59:06.301 --> 05:59:08.182
The task force made four recommendations.

05:59:08.622 --> 05:59:12.585
One of those recommendations was a rigorous authorizing renewal process for charters.

05:59:13.105 --> 05:59:19.108
NAACP's national task force concluded that only local communities should serve as authorizers.

05:59:19.668 --> 05:59:29.014
Charters should not be fiending to circumvent local control because they believe that the California State Board of Education is ready and willing to oblige their whims.

05:59:29.094 --> 05:59:33.116
However, considering the historic lack of accountability for charter schools in California,

05:59:34.216 --> 05:59:36.337
Excuse me, I'm so sorry, I lost my power there.

05:59:37.417 --> 05:59:39.198
It is understandable that KIPP is here today.

05:59:39.678 --> 05:59:40.899
A couple quick data points.

05:59:41.539 --> 05:59:46.400
39% of charters approved by the State Board of Education have failed in California.

05:59:47.121 --> 05:59:51.282
That's 15% higher than county and 10% higher than unified district.

05:59:52.202 --> 05:59:58.685
Let me be clear, the California NAACP does not support the Bay Area KIPP charter petitions.

05:59:58.885 --> 05:59:59.145
Thank you.

06:00:05.942 --> 06:00:07.704
Eric Premack, Charter Schools Development Center.

06:00:07.804 --> 06:00:14.952
This group obviously has an impeccable and long-term track record in this particular area of San Francisco.

06:00:15.953 --> 06:00:19.276
They meet all of the criteria we urge you to approve.

06:00:20.377 --> 06:00:26.464
It's unfortunate that the discussions get dragged down to the level that we're seeing today, and I'm hoping that

06:00:27.125 --> 06:00:36.812
the kind of message that you folks say send through your actions up here, send a message out to the local level that these things should be dealt with in a more appropriate way locally.

06:00:37.032 --> 06:00:37.292
Thank you.

06:00:42.045 --> 06:00:44.907
Good afternoon, Colin Miller with the California Charter Schools Association.

06:00:45.087 --> 06:00:48.430
I will associate myself with Eric's comments for brevity.

06:00:49.110 --> 06:01:03.762
We are concerned about the influx of actions at local level that are essentially ignoring the intent and the spirit of the Charter School Act to encourage and support the establishment of charter schools as an integral part of the public school system in California.

06:01:04.962 --> 06:01:13.746
We strongly support KIPP, and their organization has, as Eric said, just a tremendous track record of success in serving underserved communities.

06:01:15.066 --> 06:01:25.851
Not in any way to dismiss the good work and the pockets of good work that are going on in San Francisco, but there are always opportunities for more excellent schools in every community, so we urge your support.

06:01:25.911 --> 06:01:26.171
Thank you.

06:01:30.447 --> 06:01:31.587
My name is Marisa Hanson.

06:01:31.608 --> 06:01:32.688
I'm from San Jose.

06:01:33.888 --> 06:01:36.770
I urge you to deny the San Francisco KIPP.

06:01:37.610 --> 06:01:43.872
One thing you can do is you can go onto a website and you can look me up and you're going to find that I hold a valid teaching credential.

06:01:44.373 --> 06:01:47.414
But one thing you're going to also find if you start looking at the KIPP teachers,

06:01:47.874 --> 06:01:50.135
you're gonna find that a lot of them don't.

06:01:50.315 --> 06:01:52.235
The things that you're hearing tonight are not true.

06:01:52.775 --> 06:02:00.957
Me and a couple of my colleagues looked at our local KIPP that we have in San Jose and found that over half of the teachers did not have valid credentials.

06:02:01.337 --> 06:02:06.899
They had permits, they had expired credentials, they were teaching outside of their credential.

06:02:07.299 --> 06:02:09.119
That is not what our students deserve.

06:02:09.399 --> 06:02:10.899
They deserve credentialed teachers.

06:02:11.200 --> 06:02:12.700
Credentialed teachers, where can we find them?

06:02:13.260 --> 06:02:13.701
We can't.

06:02:13.741 --> 06:02:14.902
We have a shortage right now.

06:02:15.262 --> 06:02:24.272
There are credentialed teachers in the San Francisco district and I urge you to deny this charter and allow them to stay in their school district.

06:02:24.333 --> 06:02:24.653
Thank you.

06:02:29.008 --> 06:02:31.209
Hello, my name is Karina Rodriguez.

06:02:31.269 --> 06:02:34.511
I'm a former KIPP student from San Francisco College Prep.

06:02:34.771 --> 06:02:42.855
I'm also one of the founding class members, meaning that I was the first one to graduate from that high school.

06:02:43.475 --> 06:02:48.978
Also, I'm the founding member of a custom program we have in partnership with Boys and Girls Club.

06:02:50.879 --> 06:02:55.341
We had a lot of things going on in high school.

06:02:56.061 --> 06:02:57.022
But they weren't bad.

06:02:57.323 --> 06:03:02.188
There were changes needed for the district itself.

06:03:03.129 --> 06:03:09.357
We had classes, teachers, good, bad, but everything was made for a reason.

06:03:09.537 --> 06:03:12.160
Every change that happened over there, it was for a reason.

06:03:13.041 --> 06:03:19.263
Now if you go to a Cape high school, a Cape middle school you will see there is a good change in everything.

06:03:19.323 --> 06:03:25.686
You will see students eager to learn, eager to go to school unlike other schools I've gone to.

06:03:26.226 --> 06:03:40.631
Since I was nine I've gone to different schools, many from the district and two I wasn't actually very happy with my learning time in district schools and I was actually more eager to go to Cape schools.

06:03:41.492 --> 06:03:41.752
Thank you.

06:03:47.659 --> 06:03:51.184
Good afternoon, dear members of the State Board of Education and city staff.

06:03:51.705 --> 06:03:53.046
I am Ana Maria Aristizabal.

06:03:53.066 --> 06:03:54.989
I'm the Director of Growth at Keep Bay Area.

06:03:55.089 --> 06:03:57.192
I'm a Latina, and I'm an immigrant myself.

06:03:58.253 --> 06:04:02.299
And I work to make the dreams of these families a reality every day.

06:04:03.220 --> 06:04:08.606
I am here to share with you our long-time intention to open an elementary school in the Bayview Hunters Point.

06:04:09.146 --> 06:04:20.798
We were surprised and disappointed to learn that the district initial offer assigned us to the Mission Education Center campus in Noye Valley, over three miles and one hour away from our existing schools, walking.

06:04:21.298 --> 06:04:25.979
We were deeply concerned over displacement because our families need their school close to their residences.

06:04:26.379 --> 06:04:32.180
Moreover, we do not want to disrupt important SFUSD programs that serve immigrant children and families.

06:04:32.500 --> 06:04:38.101
We understand the worries of the families in the mission that benefit from this program and are here petitioning against us.

06:04:38.642 --> 06:04:50.924
It's our understanding that the district has a space in the classrooms, in the neighborhood, in the Bayview, and we welcome the chance to partner with the district to make a location viable for us and partner with the existing schools.

06:04:51.394 --> 06:04:52.335
Thank you for your attention.

06:04:54.637 --> 06:04:54.978
OK.

06:04:55.118 --> 06:04:57.260
I now declare the public hearing closed.

06:04:57.580 --> 06:05:00.043
And so we're ready for board member discussion.

06:05:01.104 --> 06:05:04.488
It's typical that we let one of our liaisons speak first.

06:05:05.869 --> 06:05:08.372
Board member Williams will lead off.

06:05:10.173 --> 06:05:10.594
Excuse me.

06:05:14.438 --> 06:05:26.066
So I want to say I really appreciate the comments and the approach taken by the San Francisco Unified School District staff.

06:05:26.086 --> 06:05:31.530
Remember, it was refreshingly direct.

06:05:33.271 --> 06:05:51.698
and candid about the concerns that they have at San Francisco Unified School District in terms of their facilities and their funding, and knowing that that's not a legal reason for denying a charter school.

06:05:53.419 --> 06:05:59.002
I've been aware of the KIPP schools for at least 15 years, maybe 20 years.

06:06:00.723 --> 06:06:06.867
Their network, I've never heard anything about their network.

06:06:07.688 --> 06:06:14.212
I remember when I first heard about the first KIPP school in San Jose that I had heard of, and it was intentionally

06:06:15.252 --> 06:06:20.537
and thoughtfully designed with a focus on low-income African-American students.

06:06:20.877 --> 06:06:28.363
Since then, they've expanded the focus to always low-income students, but also Latino students.

06:06:28.844 --> 06:06:29.905
And it had such a

06:06:30.425 --> 06:06:46.736
I visited that school, and it had such a thoughtfulness, intentionality, and innovative kind of approach to thinking about the culture and the families that these kids came from and what would engage them the most in learning academics.

06:06:47.517 --> 06:06:48.638
It was very impressive.

06:06:48.698 --> 06:06:55.743
And I've had no reason, whether it was when I was executive director at EdSource and we studied charter school performance,

06:06:56.823 --> 06:06:58.464
or whether I've been on the State Board.

06:06:58.484 --> 06:07:07.986
I have not had an occasion since to do anything but keep my high opinion of KIPP schools since then.

06:07:08.926 --> 06:07:14.528
I do want to clarify that the CDE's initial recommendation

06:07:15.268 --> 06:07:21.230
was a preliminary recommendation for denial pending further information.

06:07:21.270 --> 06:07:23.750
That's what they went into the ACCS with.

06:07:23.790 --> 06:07:26.491
It was not a firm recommendation for denial.

06:07:26.891 --> 06:07:29.252
They wanted to hear what the ACCS had to say.

06:07:31.733 --> 06:07:38.474
And then they changed, the ACCS voted five to two for approving the KIPP school.

06:07:39.074 --> 06:07:43.856
And CDE also subsequently changed their recommendation to a full,

06:07:44.696 --> 06:07:47.738
a recommendation for approval, which I support.

06:07:51.420 --> 06:07:53.361
Member Holladay, do you want to add at this point?

06:07:56.592 --> 06:07:57.212
since you asked.

06:07:59.533 --> 06:08:10.738
I think Janelle really stated it pretty well when she indicated that a lot of the comments that we've heard today are really about a greater policy issue about charter schools in the state and how they operate.

06:08:11.919 --> 06:08:17.201
There were also some pretty glaring misconceptions from a number of the speakers.

06:08:18.348 --> 06:08:28.716
But we're not here to make those sort of broad stroke legislative sort of decisions, nor are we here to necessarily dismiss every misconception.

06:08:28.996 --> 06:08:42.046
What we are here to do, however, is to do a de novo review of the petition and of the petitioner, what the petitioners are offering to this community.

06:08:43.046 --> 06:08:48.208
And when we do that, we listen carefully to the ACCS and we listen carefully to the CDE.

06:08:48.668 --> 06:09:02.712
And in this case, I think that there's a consensus that this is a good opportunity for families in the Bayview 100 Point.

06:09:02.812 --> 06:09:04.992
Any further board discussion?

06:09:06.353 --> 06:09:07.653
Board Member Ortiz-Lacombe.

06:09:09.710 --> 06:09:13.974
Yeah, I think so many things bubbled up today and we're hearing more and more of it.

06:09:14.054 --> 06:09:19.699
And it's unfortunate, you know, when I when I see communities of color pitted against each other, that saddens me.

06:09:20.120 --> 06:09:27.567
When we're looking at immigrant students, at least in face value, based on comments against African-American students, that's demoralizing.

06:09:27.647 --> 06:09:29.629
That is not what the goal of education is.

06:09:30.329 --> 06:09:37.511
And, you know, when we talk about the local control, I see local residents that are advocating for and against.

06:09:38.112 --> 06:09:39.112
And I think you're right.

06:09:39.192 --> 06:09:39.792
We're here.

06:09:39.812 --> 06:09:45.014
And maybe it's worth explaining what our role is because it comes up over and over again.

06:09:46.354 --> 06:09:54.658
You know, I hate to think of ourselves as having to assign roommates I don't want to live together to to really coexist at the local level.

06:09:54.739 --> 06:09:56.920
But we do have a responsibility.

06:09:57.300 --> 06:10:04.124
And it really saddens me to hear the pitting of to see the pitting of communities, specifically communities that are already marginalized.

06:10:05.024 --> 06:10:06.605
So let's not do that to ourselves.

06:10:06.645 --> 06:10:12.328
Let's not do that to our students, because both of our students, all of our students could benefit from different types of school.

06:10:12.828 --> 06:10:14.889
My children attend district schools.

06:10:15.029 --> 06:10:16.469
My husband's a district teacher.

06:10:16.749 --> 06:10:17.710
That wasn't my choice.

06:10:18.030 --> 06:10:21.911
But I can impose upon someone else the choice that they choose for their children.

06:10:23.152 --> 06:10:24.632
So let's just be respectful of that.

06:10:24.672 --> 06:10:26.053
I'm really saddened by this dynamic.

06:10:30.174 --> 06:10:31.835
No, Board Member Strauss.

06:10:31.975 --> 06:10:41.980
Just to everyone who came today to share their feelings on either side of the issue, I just want to thank you for taking the time from your days to be here and for the district and the petitioners.

06:10:42.580 --> 06:10:58.568
To our liaisons, I do think, and just to build on what Member Ortiz-Lincoln said, is that there's a lot of issues here that are struggling between, with the community, the use of district space, the issue of outreach and support and wraparound services, which we know lots of families need, the conflict between

06:10:58.968 --> 06:11:02.110
additional space that local schools can use and the entitlement under the law.

06:11:02.210 --> 06:11:05.232
But we are limited by what we can do here.

06:11:05.252 --> 06:11:07.193
And I think it's important.

06:11:07.213 --> 06:11:10.996
You know, we we don't have the power to change the legislation.

06:11:11.116 --> 06:11:15.038
We have to follow along with the role of the state board is in the appeal process.

06:11:15.078 --> 06:11:20.882
So I think it might be helpful, maybe a member holiday just to kind of highlight for us again and for the public.

06:11:21.762 --> 06:11:47.654
what the requirement is, because we had to do a fair and neutral hearing today, but what we can approve and not approve based on really restricted, the requirements are in the law of what we can approve or not approve, and I just think it might be helpful to revisit what our role is here, because we're not here to determine Prop 39 space, we're not here to determine, we only have decisions based on certain areas in spite of emotional,

06:11:48.174 --> 06:11:52.018
decisions and how we feel about, our role is very, very clear in the law.

06:11:52.059 --> 06:11:54.381
So I just appreciate that before we make a decision.

06:12:02.070 --> 06:12:08.878
Lisa, would you come forward and just as staff and just guide us on what we as a board are required by statute to do?

06:12:09.639 --> 06:12:22.825
Well, the Ed Code section, so pursuant to Ed Code section 4650J, so petitioners for a charter school that are denied at the local level may petition the State Board for approval.

06:12:23.645 --> 06:12:25.546
Let me pull up my Ed Code section here.

06:12:26.166 --> 06:12:27.827
It's based on certain conditions.

06:12:51.269 --> 06:12:58.252
Okay, so I can first give you the reasons if that.

06:12:58.272 --> 06:13:00.213
Oh, thank you.

06:13:00.233 --> 06:13:00.513
That's not it.

06:13:26.772 --> 06:13:28.354
We have legal counsel do this?

06:13:28.374 --> 06:13:29.796
I think we ought to have legal counsel.

06:13:29.816 --> 06:13:30.256
Give me just a sec.

06:13:30.276 --> 06:13:31.278
I just am not finding it.

06:13:31.338 --> 06:13:31.758
I'm sorry.

06:13:31.778 --> 06:13:32.079
Go ahead.

06:13:32.219 --> 06:13:32.980
Judy Sias.

06:13:34.423 --> 06:13:34.903
Oh, here it is.

06:13:34.943 --> 06:13:35.944
Sorry, Chewy.

06:13:36.024 --> 06:13:36.444
I didn't see it.

06:13:36.464 --> 06:13:39.985
There are four reasons for denial in the education code.

06:13:40.385 --> 06:13:45.227
It's the same four reasons that are for denial at the district, county, and the state board level.

06:13:46.027 --> 06:13:50.209
As I think Bruce or Trish said, it is a review of the petition at each level.

06:13:50.629 --> 06:13:54.691
Even though you're an appellate body, you are not limited by the findings of the district or the county.

06:13:54.971 --> 06:13:56.811
You do a de novo review of the petition.

06:13:56.831 --> 06:13:58.572
The four findings are the same.

06:14:00.589 --> 06:14:08.294
One of them is not, Lisa will read the findings, the fiscal condition, declining enrollment, that is not one of the reasons for denial.

06:14:08.654 --> 06:14:09.915
So I'll let Lisa read them to you.

06:14:10.015 --> 06:14:10.376
Thank you.

06:14:10.696 --> 06:14:11.877
Sorry, Judy, I wasn't finding them.

06:14:12.177 --> 06:14:13.318
So there are four reasons.

06:14:13.898 --> 06:14:18.701
The charter school presents an unsound educational program for pupils to be enrolled in the charter school.

06:14:18.761 --> 06:14:24.025
So they have to make, the board will have to make one of these findings just as the locals have to as well.

06:14:24.385 --> 06:14:30.029
So the first finding is a charter school presents an unsound educational program for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school.

06:14:30.869 --> 06:14:37.050
The petitioners are demonstratively unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition.

06:14:37.651 --> 06:14:47.073
The petition does not contain the number of signatures required, and the petition does not contain an affirmation of each of the conditions described in the subdivision also.

06:14:47.433 --> 06:14:50.573
So it's the same conditions that would be at the local level as well.

06:14:51.273 --> 06:14:58.015
And of course, to your point, Member Strauss, is that our hands are tied.

06:14:58.869 --> 06:15:24.717
Legally in lots of ways as you say we are not here to make a decision about an appeal based upon whether or not It will involve a prop 39 situation or whether Financially it puts a burden on one entity or another The fact is that we have to look at this as a separate You know

06:15:26.229 --> 06:15:33.298
task of making sure that the petition is going to meet those four requirements.

06:15:33.418 --> 06:15:36.522
And then it's our obligation to approve.

06:15:37.984 --> 06:15:42.870
And that's stated very clearly in statute.

06:15:44.822 --> 06:15:47.023
I'll just elaborate on that a little bit more.

06:15:47.323 --> 06:15:51.904
You mentioned, and so did Judy Saez, the de novo review.

06:15:52.544 --> 06:15:56.686
And for those of you that don't know Latin, that's basically with fresh eyes.

06:15:57.086 --> 06:16:01.047
We don't overturn district decisions or county decisions.

06:16:02.287 --> 06:16:18.292
We look at what they did, but we have an advisory commission on charter schools that is in statute and has regulations and has a diverse group of people on it, including a representative of district superintendents and of counties and of traditional school teachers.

06:16:19.092 --> 06:16:24.634
We listen to their advice and we listen to CDE's analysis, but in the end,

06:16:25.314 --> 06:16:39.691
We need the law and the regulations give the State Board its own discretion to come to its own judgment about whether or not a charter petition adequately met the four conditions that Lisa just described.

06:16:40.372 --> 06:16:45.317
And just a further note is that because we know this work is hard,

06:16:46.098 --> 06:16:55.787
Because we know it's hard on you whether you're the petitioner applying or you're the district or the county hoping for a different outcome.

06:16:56.948 --> 06:16:59.811
Because the climate has gotten more challenging and difficult.

06:17:01.252 --> 06:17:06.655
Member Holiday and I attend every one of the ACCS meetings even though that's not in our job description.

06:17:07.156 --> 06:17:18.903
We do that in between state board meetings because we want to get as much information as possible from as many parties in order to come to a decision about what we might recommend.

06:17:18.963 --> 06:17:20.424
We take this very seriously.

06:17:20.444 --> 06:17:26.828
Okay, I have at this point Karen Valdez.

06:17:29.261 --> 06:17:29.601
Thank you.

06:17:29.641 --> 06:17:31.422
So a point of clarification for me.

06:17:31.522 --> 06:17:34.483
So I understand that the petition comes to the local level.

06:17:34.743 --> 06:17:36.383
And so San Francisco looked at it.

06:17:36.423 --> 06:17:38.224
They did their due diligence.

06:17:38.284 --> 06:17:39.184
They had findings.

06:17:39.664 --> 06:17:43.125
And I know that financially, we can't deny a charter based on that.

06:17:43.165 --> 06:17:49.707
But it does contribute in some ways to unlikely to implement if the finances aren't all there.

06:17:50.227 --> 06:17:55.769
And I know that in the original report, I mean, charter school is what I'm talking about in the budget.

06:17:57.049 --> 06:18:07.112
And so then I know that in one of the online reports, the summary for ACCS, it talked about the concern about finances.

06:18:07.572 --> 06:18:10.293
So my question is, how much did the petition change?

06:18:10.333 --> 06:18:15.194
And I know in a de novo, it doesn't necessarily change, but there's agreements, right?

06:18:15.694 --> 06:18:21.196
So what were the big agreements that helped us have more confidence in this going forward?

06:18:21.556 --> 06:18:26.000
Does that make sense what I'm asking?

06:18:26.040 --> 06:18:32.746
That was the information we talked about a little earlier on, the additional information we did ask for after the ACCS meeting.

06:18:33.206 --> 06:18:35.308
So we did ask for some clarifying information.

06:18:35.328 --> 06:18:35.608
For example,

06:18:37.970 --> 06:18:46.134
We saw that the budget was highly reliant on philanthropic funding, so we asked for some additional information, like where is that coming from?

06:18:46.234 --> 06:18:49.036
Does the KIPP Foundation already have that?

06:18:49.116 --> 06:18:50.296
Is it in the bank already?

06:18:50.877 --> 06:18:54.959
We did get some bank account information, some financial statements.

06:18:56.261 --> 06:19:00.507
We then took that into account as we looked at the multiyear financial plan.

06:19:00.968 --> 06:19:10.403
That was one element that we looked at additionally to feel that we could make a viable determination on their fiscal soundness from this point forward.

06:19:11.103 --> 06:19:33.273
We also had they had included some information on the San Francisco proposition a and H that had passed We didn't see anything initially that that made us comfortable knowing that the charters that Kip would Be able to get actually use some of that proposition funding so they submitted some clarifying information to us like the narrative from the proposition and

06:19:33.673 --> 06:19:43.615
that gave us more comfort in being able to then use those fundings, that funding they had in their budget, we had initially taken that out because we really couldn't verify that.

06:19:43.875 --> 06:19:52.376
So we were able to put that back in to then determine if, on top of the philanthropic funding, that we felt their budget and the financials were viable.

06:19:52.676 --> 06:19:54.977
So that's the type of thing that we did.

06:19:55.037 --> 06:20:00.998
We also asked for some more clarification about employee qualifications and salaries, that kind of thing.

06:20:03.198 --> 06:20:14.805
We had some questions about what they were accounting for in terms of their facility allotment out of the LCCF, so we got some clarification from them on that.

06:20:16.366 --> 06:20:21.730
Then, we asked about whether their teachers were opting in if they were opting into CalSTRS.

06:20:22.510 --> 06:20:24.271
So we asked for some clarification on that.

06:20:24.332 --> 06:20:32.077
They said in this case that their employees would participate in the federal social security system and had an option for a 401k.

06:20:32.437 --> 06:20:42.344
So it was those types of things that we asked for some clarification on that gave us a comfort level on their finances and then also more on their operational elements.

06:20:44.325 --> 06:20:44.845
Does that help?

06:20:45.546 --> 06:20:45.806
Okay.

06:20:46.146 --> 06:20:46.987
Board Member Rucker.

06:20:50.006 --> 06:21:04.952
Okay, so I also agree that there is clear legal guidance and requirements on how the board, in reviewing this case for an appeal, must act and what they must be guided by.

06:21:05.452 --> 06:21:19.198
But what always presents a conflict for me, and it's been an ongoing concern during my tenure on the board, has been how, in doing the de novo review, how significantly different

06:21:19.938 --> 06:21:40.194
the content or additional information that the board uses in its review that substantially changes the application that the county office or the local district school board would have reviewed in their process to either approve or deny the charter petition.

06:21:40.775 --> 06:21:45.639
And I remain concerned that a lot of the information that is often added

06:21:46.239 --> 06:21:56.084
to a petition that is reviewed in the department's process is more than merely technical and is more material than technical.

06:21:56.584 --> 06:22:08.230
And so while the petitioners and the people who are opposed to the petition have very emotional concerns about why the petition is or is not a good idea,

06:22:08.790 --> 06:22:15.394
And I agree with Board Member Lincoln that I also hate to see communities of color divided on these issues.

06:22:15.814 --> 06:22:28.221
What continues to divide my decision-making process is my continuing concern about the differences between what is being reviewed here that is either technical or material and that

06:22:28.661 --> 06:22:31.482
definition and that work continues to evolve.

06:22:31.902 --> 06:22:46.386
I have an easier time when those changes are not made with approving and substantiating an appeal than when in cases like this there are clear additional pieces of information and content that have been added to the charter.

06:22:46.446 --> 06:22:49.147
So, and I continue to ask every time we have

06:22:49.807 --> 06:22:59.596
these particular petitions that come up like this with added new information that was not clarified or that doesn't seem to have been considered by the district.

06:22:59.676 --> 06:23:12.328
I continue to have concerns that we don't resolve what is clearly material or what is clearly technical because it seems to change every single time to fit the circumstance with pretzel-like acumen

06:23:12.668 --> 06:23:15.150
to make it work to it for the purpose of approving it.

06:23:15.230 --> 06:23:17.052
So I have that concern.

06:23:17.612 --> 06:23:28.941
And, you know, today for this petition, I'm not going to vote on it because that is my concern about what happened with the material that was and the additional content that was added for the review by the department.

06:23:30.202 --> 06:23:31.023
Board Member Williams.

06:23:34.571 --> 06:23:37.074
I want to be clear that the petition was not changed.

06:23:37.534 --> 06:23:40.157
They did not change the petition that they submitted.

06:23:42.459 --> 06:23:55.272
CDE asked them to clarify some things they did not understand in the petition, and that's the prerogative of the district, it's the prerogative of the county, and it's the prerogative of the state to ask for clarifications.

06:23:56.093 --> 06:24:11.843
So for, as an example, one CDE practice is that if there is what they call soft money in the budget, philanthropic funding, they tend to take it out as not being, you can't count on it.

06:24:12.403 --> 06:24:19.368
And that's a wise thing to do if it's, they're going to write grant proposals, they're going to try to raise money.

06:24:19.928 --> 06:24:21.169
In this particular case,

06:24:22.530 --> 06:24:27.933
KIPP was given the opportunity to explain how their foundation will fund this.

06:24:28.133 --> 06:24:33.477
And KIPP is one of those foundations that if they're making a commitment to a school, it's money in the bank.

06:24:34.057 --> 06:24:35.338
It's not really soft money.

06:24:36.238 --> 06:24:44.064
So it's my understanding that you asked for clarification because it wasn't completely clear, but they did not come back.

06:24:44.324 --> 06:24:45.845
There were no technical amendments.

06:24:46.365 --> 06:24:46.945
Is that correct?

06:24:47.206 --> 06:24:49.227
There were no modifications.

06:24:49.607 --> 06:24:54.710
It was just asking for information that can be done at the district level and the county level.

06:24:55.090 --> 06:25:03.396
And frankly, should be if there's an interest, a genuine interest by the district and county to understand the petition more fully before taking action.

06:25:04.116 --> 06:25:06.017
Yeah, I'm ready for a motion.

06:25:06.077 --> 06:25:07.258
Can we get a thank you.

06:25:08.393 --> 06:25:11.456
Well, I just one brief comment and then I'll make the motion.

06:25:11.496 --> 06:25:17.601
The brief comment is that I have over the five, six years now or whatever, been working with CDE.

06:25:19.022 --> 06:25:27.970
I am impressed with how careful CDE's review of the petitions have been, how careful they are not to

06:25:29.411 --> 06:25:38.437
make material revisions to a petition and stay within the realm of clarification and occasionally a technical amendment.

06:25:39.858 --> 06:25:49.564
I feel very comfortable with what has been going on in that realm, even though I know others have a sense that it may not quite be that way.

06:25:49.644 --> 06:25:57.169
But I'm saying this honestly from all the meetings and all the liaison calls that we have.

06:25:57.810 --> 06:26:01.558
Anyway, I will move CDE recommendation.

06:26:01.758 --> 06:26:02.419
And I'll second.

06:26:03.482 --> 06:26:04.604
Motion by board members.

06:26:05.720 --> 06:26:06.180
Yeah, go ahead.

06:26:06.220 --> 06:26:09.141
I just had a comment, and it doesn't have anything to do with the motion.

06:26:09.762 --> 06:26:15.984
Just in general, because I saw it here, we see a lot of these what I call dash PIs, where it's like data dashboard.

06:26:16.004 --> 06:26:18.325
They're using colors, but then also the API numbers.

06:26:18.865 --> 06:26:20.246
Can we not do that anymore?

06:26:20.366 --> 06:26:26.369
Because I saw it in one of the slides to show how this school would compare to the neighboring schools, the rankings.

06:26:26.629 --> 06:26:28.850
But it's like color and ranking, an actual number.

06:26:29.010 --> 06:26:31.150
And I've seen this in a couple of charter proposals.

06:26:31.571 --> 06:26:34.872
I think it's confusing, because now we have a new data dashboard.

06:26:35.372 --> 06:26:37.153
Yeah, it was in the presentation.

06:26:37.194 --> 06:26:42.737
I know we have a million other presentations tomorrow, so if you're listening, do not do the dash PI.

06:26:43.658 --> 06:26:44.798
We have a dashboard.

06:26:44.859 --> 06:26:45.719
It's color-coded.

06:26:45.999 --> 06:26:47.000
Use that information.

06:26:47.040 --> 06:26:49.482
We don't need to use numeric numbers and a color.

06:26:49.542 --> 06:26:50.662
That does not exist.

06:26:50.983 --> 06:26:52.504
It's not a real accountability system.

06:26:52.804 --> 06:26:53.104
Thank you.

06:26:55.105 --> 06:26:56.466
All right, I think we're ready for the vote.

06:26:57.367 --> 06:26:58.828
All those in favor, raise your hands.

06:27:00.609 --> 06:27:01.690
Okay, it carries.

06:27:02.470 --> 06:27:03.571
Is there any abstentions?

06:27:05.545 --> 06:27:06.305
One abstention.

06:27:06.445 --> 06:27:08.206
Okay, so that carries.

06:27:08.246 --> 06:27:08.686
Thank you.

06:27:10.847 --> 06:27:11.687
Yeah, we need a break.

06:27:12.247 --> 06:27:17.788
So let's, yeah, let's come back at 5 of 4.

06:27:17.868 --> 06:27:17.928
5 of 4.

06:27:18.048 --> 06:27:18.168
Okay.

06:27:32.850 --> 06:27:36.713
Okay, the board will reconvene and we're now on to item six.

06:27:37.734 --> 06:27:49.183
The establishment of a charter school in this Eastside Union High School District in the Santa Clara County Board of Education appeal.

06:27:51.906 --> 06:27:52.246
Okay.

06:27:53.627 --> 06:28:00.813
So we're on to item six and Lisa will present for the department and then we will proceed to the public hearing.

06:28:02.470 --> 06:28:12.417
Item six is an appeal by KIPP Eastside High School to establish a new charter school pursuant to the Ed Code section that took me forever to find a few minutes ago.

06:28:13.037 --> 06:28:20.983
Petitioners for a charter school that have been denied at the local level may petition the state board for approval of the charter subject to certain conditions.

06:28:22.537 --> 06:28:25.038
This is a summary of KIPP East Bay.

06:28:25.618 --> 06:28:31.980
On August 17, 2017, the Eastside High School District voted to deny the petition on a vote of three to two.

06:28:32.000 --> 06:28:39.462
On November 1, 2017, the Santa Clara Office of Education voted to deny the petition by a vote of four to two.

06:28:39.482 --> 06:28:46.364
On November 28, 2017, the petition was submitted to the State Board of Education on appeal.

06:28:49.341 --> 06:28:56.463
The proposed plan is for a 9-12, a high school, a site-based program in Eastside High School area.

06:28:57.023 --> 06:29:08.025
The targeted enrollment is 134 students in the first year of operation in 2018-19, increasing over the five-year period to 500 in 2022-23.

06:29:08.885 --> 06:29:12.886
Again, targeting the traditionally underserved students in the Eastside High School District.

06:29:14.266 --> 06:29:22.388
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools met on February 7, 2018, and the commission moved to recommend approval of the petition.

06:29:22.928 --> 06:29:40.073
The motion passed by a vote of six to one, and in the same case as the first KIPP we heard a little earlier, the petitioner submitted additional information to CDE after the ACCS meeting that was reviewed by staff as we did with the first petition for the elementary school.

06:29:41.857 --> 06:29:50.622
The CDE is recommending that the State Board hold a public hearing to approve the request to establish KIPP Eastside High School for a five-year term.

06:29:51.202 --> 06:30:04.110
The recommendation is based on demonstratively likely to implement the program due to a realistic financial plan and operational plan and a sound educational practice and comprehensive description of the educational program.

06:30:05.051 --> 06:30:07.312
I am here and available for any questions that you might have.

06:30:09.451 --> 06:30:10.471
Okay, thank you.

06:30:10.811 --> 06:30:16.173
Is there any board questions that you would have that are technical before we begin?

06:30:16.193 --> 06:30:20.134
Okay, not seeing any.

06:30:20.174 --> 06:30:26.996
Then we will follow our procedure of last time where we have a public hearing.

06:30:27.096 --> 06:30:30.777
So first, we're going to have an open public hearing.

06:30:30.917 --> 06:30:32.557
Each side will have 10 minutes.

06:30:33.798 --> 06:30:38.659
And then we'll have public comment at a minute.

06:30:39.198 --> 06:30:40.979
and then the board will deliver further.

06:30:41.079 --> 06:30:51.648
So we will start with those who support the recommendation to approve the charter school petition.

06:30:51.688 --> 06:30:56.832
So these are people that support the petition by KIPP.

06:30:57.112 --> 06:30:58.353
And so you have 10 minutes.

06:30:58.453 --> 06:30:59.894
I declare the public hearing open.

06:31:26.817 --> 06:31:28.278
Good afternoon board members.

06:31:28.558 --> 06:31:30.219
Thank you for your time and attention.

06:31:30.779 --> 06:31:33.160
You have invested to consider our charter petition.

06:31:33.741 --> 06:31:37.823
I am Michelle Baraki the founding school leader of our new KIPP Eastside High School.

06:31:38.563 --> 06:31:46.508
In 2009 I began my teaching career at a traditional public high school and in 2013 I joined KIPP San Jose Collegiate.

06:31:47.108 --> 06:31:53.612
There as a teacher and assistant principal I've learned to be a leader in a school that holds high expectations

06:31:54.850 --> 06:31:58.091
and provides a college preparatory education to all its students.

06:31:58.791 --> 06:32:03.732
I am excited to remain in the San Jose community to found and lead our next high school.

06:32:04.893 --> 06:32:09.594
KIPP has partnered with families in East San Jose since 2004.

06:32:10.414 --> 06:32:17.696
We are here to provide students with the opportunity to be successful and to deliver on the promise of a college preparatory education.

06:32:18.916 --> 06:32:22.197
Here are some words from our families about what KIPP means to them.

06:32:35.183 --> 06:32:35.823
Outstanding.

06:32:36.284 --> 06:32:37.164
Brilliant.

06:32:37.204 --> 06:32:37.644
Quality.

06:32:38.125 --> 06:32:39.165
Mejor educación.

06:32:39.585 --> 06:32:40.246
Outstanding.

06:32:40.646 --> 06:32:41.467
Excelencia.

06:32:41.767 --> 06:32:43.127
Buena educación.

06:32:43.408 --> 06:32:44.348
Máxima educación.

06:32:44.908 --> 06:32:46.449
KIPP is our future.

06:32:46.829 --> 06:32:50.371
KIPP High School means continued success for my grandchild.

06:32:50.792 --> 06:32:51.512
KIPP it the best.

06:32:56.195 --> 06:33:01.057
Porque quiero que cumpla sus metas, sus logros, y alcance sus sueños.

06:33:01.337 --> 06:33:02.198
KIPP es...

06:33:03.041 --> 06:33:10.243
A great power, but above all, a community force for the whole community of here, of Quipraix, and of all of San Jose.

06:33:10.504 --> 06:33:13.445
That's why we want you to support our community, whoever it belongs to.

06:33:13.465 --> 06:33:20.567
Because they are given an attention that in other schools they don't have, and each one, what they need.

06:33:20.607 --> 06:33:25.729
That they leave better prepared, they worry about them, as people, as individuals.

06:33:30.472 --> 06:33:33.654
Because for me, they are some of the best high school I have ever known.

06:33:33.674 --> 06:33:36.176
The best that exists here in the Bahia area.

06:33:36.196 --> 06:33:40.359
Because for me, it is the best high school that San Jose, California can have.

06:33:53.038 --> 06:33:54.820
I want to bring you to East San Jose.

06:33:55.261 --> 06:34:00.447
Currently, we have three middle schools, KIPP Heartwood, KIPP Heritage, and KIPP Prize.

06:34:01.147 --> 06:34:08.916
All schools have been locally authorized, including our existing high school, which was renewed November 2017 by Eastside Union High School District.

06:34:09.697 --> 06:34:14.640
Next fall, for the first time, there are 300 KIPP students entering the ninth grade.

06:34:15.161 --> 06:34:23.806
This is the primary driver for opening the second high school to fulfill the promise of an aligned KIPP path in San Jose from middle to high school for our families.

06:34:24.807 --> 06:34:31.792
We know KIPP middle school students are best served by having the opportunity to attend a KIPP high school.

06:34:32.393 --> 06:34:40.758
Students who attend KIPP Bay Area high schools are more likely to graduate from high school, matriculate to college, and graduate from college.

06:34:41.972 --> 06:34:45.474
Specifically, here is the data for KIPP San Jose Collegiate.

06:34:46.154 --> 06:34:54.099
We ensure all students fulfill the A through G graduation requirements that prepare students to be eligible to apply to college.

06:34:54.519 --> 06:35:02.524
This compares to the 56% for the average of the district and only 35% for Hispanic students.

06:35:03.805 --> 06:35:09.028
Through our KIPP through college program, we continue to work with students throughout their college education.

06:35:10.643 --> 06:35:19.069
KIPP San Jose Collegiate student outcomes exceed those of peer student populations within Eastside Union High School District and within the state.

06:35:19.769 --> 06:35:30.877
To highlight the achievement of our socioeconomically disadvantaged students, we are performing 23% higher in ELA and 26% higher in math compared to the district.

06:35:32.558 --> 06:35:36.962
We also use advanced placement exams as a measure of our students' college readiness.

06:35:38.337 --> 06:35:46.910
As you can see here, KIPP San Jose Collegiate students have a higher AP participation and passage rates as compared to the district and state respectively.

06:35:47.550 --> 06:35:52.938
We are proud to share that our school program has been recognized as one of the top high schools in the nation.

06:35:54.571 --> 06:36:04.576
Based on our strong track record and history of serving the Eastside community it was our hope to be locally authorized and continue to partner with the Eastside Union High School District.

06:36:05.156 --> 06:36:13.920
In efforts to collaborate we met with district staff and board members since January 2017 to discuss our petition and accommodate their requests.

06:36:14.660 --> 06:36:17.722
We even reduced the projective size of our school from 800 to 500 students.

06:36:20.143 --> 06:36:27.805
Despite a positive recommendation for approval, the board denied our school with no findings saying the vote was symbolic in nature.

06:36:29.326 --> 06:36:33.347
KIPP appealed to the district's decision to the Santa Clara County Office of Education.

06:36:34.047 --> 06:36:37.128
The county staff also granted us a positive recommendation.

06:36:37.688 --> 06:36:42.490
Unfortunately, SCOE wanted to unilaterally impose clauses that were unacceptable to KIPP

06:36:43.050 --> 06:36:53.096
and did not agree to negotiate prior to November 28th in order to meet the SBE's timeline in case we could not reach an agreement and therefore denied our petition.

06:36:54.236 --> 06:37:03.041
Though our families were deeply disappointed and disheartened by these events, we remain undeterred in providing the best possible education for our students.

06:37:03.542 --> 06:37:10.686
We are thankful for the Advisory Committee on Charter Schools and the CDE staff for recommending the approval of our charter petition.

06:37:13.598 --> 06:37:28.397
KIPP Eastside High School will build off the success of its sister school and provide all of our KIPP middle school students with the same opportunity to be successful and deliver on the promise of a college education, college preparatory education to all of our families.

06:37:29.744 --> 06:37:34.465
The new KIPP Eastside High School's official name is KIPP Navigate College Prep.

06:37:35.305 --> 06:37:43.387
We are committed to actualizing every student's potential by connecting students' purpose, talents, and passions to their learning experiences.

06:37:44.067 --> 06:37:47.588
The logo serves as a visual representation of our school vision.

06:37:48.248 --> 06:37:54.529
The six values represented by the star spell out circle, a representation of our community coming together.

06:37:55.509 --> 06:38:01.633
Circles are powerful because they create a natural equity, inviting everyone to be seen and heard.

06:38:02.354 --> 06:38:08.618
The compass is our personalized wayfinding tool used in service of creating inspired and purposeful lives.

06:38:10.839 --> 06:38:13.621
Here is an overview of our school core program.

06:38:16.523 --> 06:38:19.965
Today I will highlight a few of our instructional and cultural pillars.

06:38:22.549 --> 06:38:27.591
Students need to be given academically demanding content and be provided with support.

06:38:28.192 --> 06:38:38.617
The AP for all curriculum enables all students to participate in a truly rigorous academic program and tackle college level work in a supported and scaffolded way.

06:38:39.477 --> 06:38:51.583
Many of our students enter ninth grade with a variety of needs and this school is ready to meet their needs through a multi-tiered approach that includes staff development, foundational courses and individualized interventions.

06:38:53.288 --> 06:38:55.168
We are asking a lot of students.

06:38:55.709 --> 06:39:04.331
Teachers, as teachers, we will close the gap in student learning while holding a high bar by building strong muscles in our academic power moves.

06:39:05.111 --> 06:39:14.493
Lesson internalization is our deep level planning of the AP for all curriculum with a focus on creating exemplars and anticipating misconceptions.

06:39:15.533 --> 06:39:19.895
Data-driven instruction uses classroom-level data to improve student outcomes.

06:39:20.355 --> 06:39:35.360
When teachers engage in dialogue and make sense of the data together, they develop a much deeper understanding of what is going on relative to student learning and can create a strategic reteach plan to close the gaps in student learning.

06:39:36.580 --> 06:39:45.813
Observation feedback is critical to the growth and development of our teachers' execution, where teachers will receive regular feedback on their teaching practice.

06:39:47.944 --> 06:39:52.188
At KIPP, character education is just as important as academics.

06:39:52.788 --> 06:40:04.898
Therefore, we have a robust advisory curriculum that focuses on social-emotional learning for students to foster and maintain positive relationships with themselves, one another, and the community.

06:40:05.519 --> 06:40:09.682
They learn to leverage their individual and collective strengths for the good of others.

06:40:10.223 --> 06:40:14.827
Students rigorously extract value from failure, reflect, and grow.

06:40:17.256 --> 06:40:19.937
Social emotional learning helps build a strong culture.

06:40:20.477 --> 06:40:24.938
Students have a sense of belonging to authentic relationships with one another.

06:40:25.798 --> 06:40:28.279
SEL also amplifies academic results.

06:40:28.779 --> 06:40:32.480
Students feel safe enough to take academic risks to really grow.

06:40:32.500 --> 06:40:45.104
Phase work is the personalized SEL curriculum which students and staff engage in in advisory to explore their own identity, strengths, passions, and align their actions to their personal and professional goals.

06:40:46.324 --> 06:40:51.846
Each day, students will have access to learning opportunities to open their doors to their futures.

06:40:52.466 --> 06:41:04.650
Four years from now, we will have our first class of students cross the stage at graduation with their ability to articulate their purpose and how they're connecting their education to their career aspirations.

06:41:05.310 --> 06:41:11.992
Students will confidently step into the future with real world rigorous learning experiences to reflect upon.

06:41:12.632 --> 06:41:20.578
They will have an unwavering belief in themselves and one another and what they can accomplish because they're comfortable with courageous challenges.

06:41:21.239 --> 06:41:27.604
Students will look back on their high school experience with pride of their individual and collective growth and achievement.

06:41:28.225 --> 06:41:33.108
With innovative mindsets, our graduates are equipped and ready to take on the world.

06:41:33.829 --> 06:41:35.891
Thank you and we look forward to addressing your questions.

06:41:37.859 --> 06:41:42.309
We now have 10 minutes for the people opposed to the petition.

06:41:49.400 --> 06:41:54.081
Good afternoon, President Kirst, state board members, community, and staff.

06:41:54.521 --> 06:42:01.843
My name is Christelle Johnson, and I serve as the director on the charter school oversight and monitoring team for the Santa Clara County Office of Education.

06:42:02.643 --> 06:42:15.607
The Santa Clara County Board of Education is the largest county authorizer in the state of California, with 23 authorized charter schools, which serves approximately 10,000 students, and spans 31 districts across Santa Clara County.

06:42:16.508 --> 06:42:29.223
On September 5th, 2017, the County Charter Schools Office received a petition from the KIPP Eastside High School Charter Team seeking to establish and operate a public charter high school for grades 9 through 12.

06:42:30.044 --> 06:42:33.488
This petition was submitted on appeal from the Eastside Union High School District.

06:42:34.048 --> 06:42:39.793
On September 20th, the Santa Clara County Board of Education held a public hearing for KIPP.

06:42:40.754 --> 06:42:51.324
SCCOE charter staff reviewed the KIPP Eastside High petition and recommended approval of the petition during the Santa Clara Board decision hearing on November 1st.

06:42:52.165 --> 06:42:58.350
The approval contained several items which needed to be addressed within the MOU process to be completed by January 31st, 2018.

06:43:01.152 --> 06:43:16.316
After review of the proposed MOU and the recommendations made by school staff, on October 30th, KIPP requested that SCCOE revise the terms and the recommended board resolution for approval and have the MOU completed by November 28th.

06:43:17.217 --> 06:43:25.519
Or that an alternative is that Santa Clara County Board of Education move to deny the charter so that KIPP could appeal directly to the State Board of Education.

06:43:26.679 --> 06:43:42.000
On November 1st, 2017, the Santa Clara County Board of Education voted 5-2 to deny KIPP Eastside High School petition on the grounds that KIPP would not agree to the proposed expectations expressed in the approved resolution and proposed MOU.

06:43:47.130 --> 06:44:04.129
Good afternoon my name is Chris Funk superintendent for Eastside Union High School District and my goal tonight is this afternoon simply to provide you some context of how my board of trustees voted to talk a little bit about choice and about the process for charter school appeals.

06:44:05.546 --> 06:44:12.991
First and foremost, when you look at the intent of the charter school law, I think Eastside is the poster child of that intent.

06:44:13.452 --> 06:44:21.057
We currently have 12 charters in our district, 10 approved by us, two approved by the county.

06:44:22.158 --> 06:44:24.119
We have 11 comprehensive high schools.

06:44:24.760 --> 06:44:32.766
It was never the intent of the charter school law to have more charter high schools than the high schools that represent the district.

06:44:33.672 --> 06:44:43.060
We collaborate amazingly with our charters in the sense that no charter has gone to the county on appeal for a renewal.

06:44:43.640 --> 06:44:50.986
Our process is transparent, it's fair, and we have renewed over and over again with our charters, including KIPP.

06:44:52.765 --> 06:44:57.367
We have provided five-year leases to all of our charters that are 10 of the 12.

06:44:57.407 --> 06:45:00.709
Two of them are located at National Hispanic University.

06:45:01.209 --> 06:45:06.352
Five-year leases so that we don't have to do the dance of Prop 39 every single year.

06:45:07.132 --> 06:45:13.735
We have provided bond monies to upgrade and build facilities for our charters and provide technology.

06:45:14.036 --> 06:45:20.559
We've included language in our upcoming June 5th parcel tax to provide to our charter schools.

06:45:22.898 --> 06:45:33.105
We've even provided a approved agreement from the board to allow KIPP to build an 800-student high school on the district campus.

06:45:34.906 --> 06:45:37.988
KIPP did not pull their contingencies.

06:45:38.408 --> 06:45:43.392
At the very last minute, they missed their deadline to release their contingency, and that deal died.

06:45:43.712 --> 06:45:51.077
For 800 students, we would not be here today if they had approved that, which our board had signed and sealed, ready to go.

06:45:52.489 --> 06:46:03.380
When you talk about the intent of the law, it's to provide underrepresented schools or neighborhoods that have underperforming schools an opportunity for a charter school.

06:46:04.341 --> 06:46:07.965
We have 25 high schools in Eastside Union High School District.

06:46:08.425 --> 06:46:13.230
When you look at our data, our graduation rates have gone up six straight years.

06:46:14.427 --> 06:46:18.210
The state-defined graduation rate is 85% for our students.

06:46:18.570 --> 06:46:21.933
It's 80% for African American, it's 77% for Latino.

06:46:22.513 --> 06:46:37.924
But when you look at our locally defined cohort rate, kids that start with us and attend 720 days all four years, our cohort rate jumps to 95% at the district level, 96% for African American students, and 91% for Latino students.

06:46:41.508 --> 06:46:49.613
Our kids continue to grow because our enrollment grows throughout the four years, whereas KIPP and other charter school, their enrollment goes down.

06:46:50.614 --> 06:47:04.282
And so I have a lot of respect for the program for KIPP, but when you talk about 100% of your kids are A through G compliant, but you don't have the same number of kids, your seniors that you started with in ninth grade, that skews the numbers.

06:47:05.888 --> 06:47:13.133
The whole point of why my board chose to vote no is because we've reached that tipping point.

06:47:13.653 --> 06:47:15.335
We are in declining enrollment.

06:47:15.655 --> 06:47:29.144
At the very same board meeting to review this petition, they had a resolution to lay off 140 employees over the next two years in order for us to have a positive three-year budget.

06:47:30.273 --> 06:47:48.199
How could they be fiduciary responsible members of their community, voting members of the community, elected by their community to lay off individuals and approve another charter for 500 students, which would then take away the support structures that we have in place in Eastside.

06:47:48.559 --> 06:47:49.999
They just could not do that.

06:47:51.960 --> 06:47:59.162
And so yes, we talked about the last presentation, and we have this review of what the law states.

06:48:00.319 --> 06:48:07.464
But this board has the power and has demonstrated the ability to skirt the law in the past.

06:48:08.522 --> 06:48:29.979
I was at the last month advisory commission when the chair of the commission sits there and gives advice, executive coaching, which I believe in amazingly, executive coaching should happen, but giving executive coaching to the petitioner on how to improve their presentation, how to improve their petition to make it stronger.

06:48:30.970 --> 06:48:32.471
That's not defining the law.

06:48:32.931 --> 06:48:34.912
That's skirting their responsibility.

06:48:35.632 --> 06:48:50.558
This board has also approved charters in the past, not necessarily the KIPP San Francisco, where there has been material change, where grade levels have been lopped off petitions, and this board has approved it.

06:48:52.063 --> 06:48:57.127
And the elected officials at the local LEA and the county denied it.

06:48:57.828 --> 06:49:01.110
So I'm not asking you to advocate for new law.

06:49:01.190 --> 06:49:03.192
I'm not asking you to change the law.

06:49:03.592 --> 06:49:14.441
I'm asking you to use your ability to take a stand and say enough is enough and support Eastside Union High School District, support Senator Beall's SB 1362,

06:49:17.683 --> 06:49:35.237
to allow school districts the ability who have declined enrollment, who have charters already in their school district and in the neighborhoods where new petitions are being requested, so that school districts have the opportunity to deny that.

06:49:35.877 --> 06:49:39.880
Not a single one of our charters is fully enrolled, including KIPP Collegiate.

06:49:41.201 --> 06:49:44.424
Every single charter has kids from outside the district.

06:49:45.445 --> 06:49:46.645
Our families have choice.

06:49:47.557 --> 06:49:50.020
They have amazingly great schools to choose from.

06:49:51.482 --> 06:50:00.292
We're asking you to support the fiduciary responsibility that our elected officials have to our community and deny this petition.

06:50:01.594 --> 06:50:04.217
Not deny it because KIPP is not a solid program.

06:50:05.563 --> 06:50:07.583
Not deny it because we're against charters.

06:50:08.444 --> 06:50:11.104
Eastside has demonstrated that we support charter schools.

06:50:11.724 --> 06:50:21.346
We're asking you to support us because we're in decline enrollment and we cannot have more charters at the expense of laying off teachers.

06:50:23.187 --> 06:50:26.587
Thank you so very much and I'm here to answer any questions for you.

06:50:26.908 --> 06:50:27.228
Thank you.

06:50:28.748 --> 06:50:32.909
Okay that concludes those opening statements and now we will continue with the

06:50:33.993 --> 06:50:35.975
public comment one minute each.

06:50:37.556 --> 06:50:41.159
Will the following individuals please line up for item six.

06:50:41.359 --> 06:50:57.112
Kent Burke, Michael Flores Castaneda, Mike Hutchison, Jenny Ludwig, James Staten, Tracy Brown Gallardo, Alita Fisher, Melissa Dar, Adrian

06:50:58.115 --> 06:51:11.200
Adam Cordova, Anna Keller, Rosalyn Taylor, Andrea Evans, Maria Yelpik, Patricia Martinez, Nolan Highbrow, and Janelle Rooley.

06:51:20.583 --> 06:51:21.343
Pass the paper.

06:51:22.944 --> 06:51:23.864
I'm waiting for the paper.

06:51:25.005 --> 06:51:25.665
Go ahead, please.

06:51:29.141 --> 06:51:30.221
My name is Ken Bird.

06:51:30.261 --> 06:51:32.942
I'm here on behalf of the California Teachers Association.

06:51:33.922 --> 06:51:36.903
I'm passing out to you something that was posted on the website.

06:51:37.924 --> 06:51:41.125
The question really is, should this petition be denied?

06:51:43.205 --> 06:51:49.867
Because what the petitioner referred to, well, he couldn't agree to certain conditions, and they kind of glossed this over.

06:51:49.927 --> 06:51:54.589
The issue was, they were asked to commit to file a government code 1090.

06:51:56.539 --> 06:52:00.961
That's the general conflict of interest statute.

06:52:03.062 --> 06:52:04.282
Now, does that apply?

06:52:04.302 --> 06:52:09.464
I have a 17-page opinion from the legislative analyst that says it does apply.

06:52:09.484 --> 06:52:17.507
Now, we don't have time for you to discuss the issue, but there's a difference between the corporation code and the government code.

06:52:17.807 --> 06:52:22.549
It essentially says, I'm not going to have a conflict of interest for everyone.

06:52:23.590 --> 06:52:24.530
So I leave it there.

06:52:26.894 --> 06:52:45.984
Query, how can any member of the state board in good conscience be mindful of his or her fiduciary duty to the public trust to approve an appeal when the appellant charter school petitioner will not commit to the most simple basic conflict of interest law on the statute?

06:52:46.524 --> 06:52:46.984
Thank you.

06:52:48.585 --> 06:52:50.426
That's an issue you need to discuss.

06:52:50.526 --> 06:52:52.067
That's litigation pending.

06:52:57.208 --> 06:53:09.075
Mike Hutchinson with the Oakland Public Education Network and Journey for Justice National Alliance, and we stand in solidarity with Black Lives Matter and the NAACP in calling for a moratorium on charter schools and school privatization.

06:53:09.615 --> 06:53:12.497
In Oakland, we have the highest rate of charter schools in the state of California.

06:53:13.037 --> 06:53:18.541
And of our 40-plus charter schools, only two of those schools have been started in what we call the hills in Oakland.

06:53:19.081 --> 06:53:22.123
All the other charter schools have been started in low-income communities of color.

06:53:22.703 --> 06:53:28.028
And we know that if charter schools provided a better educational outcome, our families in the hills would be demanding charter schools.

06:53:28.388 --> 06:53:31.792
Instead, the opposite has happened, and they've only been put in our neighborhoods.

06:53:32.312 --> 06:53:37.197
And I actually take offense to the idea that the community is pitting ourselves against each other.

06:53:37.957 --> 06:53:44.603
What's happening is the same colonial model where charter schools are dropping into our communities, and they're the ones driving this wedge in our community.

06:53:45.364 --> 06:53:47.146
You have the authority to vote no.

06:53:48.345 --> 06:53:51.487
you actually have the moral responsibility to vote no.

06:53:52.348 --> 06:54:04.376
And many of us across the state of California are looking for leadership, are looking for somebody who's gonna stand up for our communities who over history have been disadvantaged, and the charter schools are just adding to that disadvantage.

06:54:04.616 --> 06:54:08.539
So please vote no, please vote your conscience, and use Oakland as an example.

06:54:08.759 --> 06:54:09.680
They haven't helped us.

06:54:13.994 --> 06:54:20.259
Jenny Ludwig, Eastside Union High School District, nationally board certified teacher, 2007 master's degree in teacher leadership.

06:54:20.339 --> 06:54:21.199
Why am I telling you this?

06:54:21.319 --> 06:54:25.863
I want to let you know that I do think I'm qualified to have an opinion on unsound educational practices.

06:54:26.423 --> 06:54:34.489
Is it an unsound educational practice when you have test scores pulled from great schools that say that you have 29% of your Hispanic students proficient in math?

06:54:35.029 --> 06:54:38.493
Yet, they are claiming 100% graduation rate on the same website.

06:54:38.913 --> 06:54:46.761
When we take our four-year graduation rate, you take Independence High School where San Jose Collegiate is housed, they have 85% four-year graduation rate as does KIPP.

06:54:47.021 --> 06:54:48.482
What is happening to those kids?

06:54:48.883 --> 06:54:52.166
How do they have 100% rate but only 85% on a four-year level?

06:54:52.446 --> 06:54:55.649
Because they are kicking out their kids when they are not reaching that 100% mark.

06:54:56.610 --> 06:54:59.553
Just before graduation, they are obviously kicking out their kids, and we know this.

06:54:59.573 --> 06:55:00.474
They are sent back to us.

06:55:00.574 --> 06:55:01.795
Our principal just told me that.

06:55:02.235 --> 06:55:04.437
And they come back to us, and then they change our statistics.

06:55:04.798 --> 06:55:06.059
They have AP classes.

06:55:06.099 --> 06:55:06.379
Great.

06:55:06.760 --> 06:55:12.685
Only 51% of their kids were passing the AP classes, according to the website I looked at, not what she's putting up there.

06:55:13.206 --> 06:55:16.989
And our students at Independence, at the same school where they're housed, have 60% pass rate.

06:55:17.350 --> 06:55:20.553
So I ask you to vote no based on educational practices.

06:55:20.593 --> 06:55:20.793
Thank you.

06:55:28.473 --> 06:55:29.493
Hello, hi.

06:55:30.434 --> 06:55:31.334
My name is James Staton.

06:55:31.875 --> 06:55:34.296
I'm with the San Jose Silicon Valley NAACP.

06:55:35.276 --> 06:55:39.038
And we are, I'm here because we oppose this petition.

06:55:39.798 --> 06:55:40.939
We oppose it on several grounds.

06:55:41.199 --> 06:55:54.606
One, we have a national moratorium, a resolution calling for a national moratorium on charter schools because we have concerns about oversight, fiscal accountability, and the targeting of black and brown low-income communities.

06:55:55.646 --> 06:55:57.027
Two, we believe in local control.

06:55:57.667 --> 06:55:59.528
And this petition seems to skirt that.

06:56:00.448 --> 06:56:05.611
Two, locally elected bodies of officials have looked over this petition and rejected it.

06:56:07.332 --> 06:56:12.294
And three, the diversion of scarce, very scarce resources in the district.

06:56:13.775 --> 06:56:18.577
As I stated before, there are 12 charter schools in the district that are already using these resources.

06:56:19.057 --> 06:56:20.037
We do not need any more.

06:56:20.818 --> 06:56:21.058
Thank you.

06:56:29.178 --> 06:56:38.902
Good afternoon board my name is Rosalyn Taylor and among other things I am the mom of three kids who are black who all graduated from public high school and the University of California system.

06:56:39.442 --> 06:56:45.244
I have been teaching math in Eastside San Jose for 31 years longer than charter schools have existed in the state of California.

06:56:45.725 --> 06:56:56.129
It began at 100 schools there are now 1,200 charter schools in California 12 of which are in my district and three are at one school and none of these charters are at capacity.

06:56:57.170 --> 06:57:03.092
If KIPP and the other charter schools that we already have are not a capacity, why do we need another charter school?

06:57:05.976 --> 06:57:10.078
Our publicly elected school board denied the second KIPP.

06:57:10.879 --> 06:57:21.524
Our publicly elected County Board of Education denied the second KIPP in part due to the KIPP Foundation refusal to abide by state law, including California Code 1090.

06:57:22.105 --> 06:57:29.148
I ask you, the appointed State Board of Education in California, to honor the voters of Santa Clara County and deny the petition.

06:57:29.308 --> 06:57:29.649
Thank you.

06:57:30.749 --> 06:57:32.289
Please pardon the interruption.

06:57:32.330 --> 06:57:34.790
Will the following speakers please line up?

06:57:35.010 --> 06:57:57.437
Isis Diaz, Carmen Delevos, Roberto Sota, Melissa Albrega, Aidan Ma, Katie Peterson, Faro Quadri, Ellie Herrera, Quinn Ma, Beth Thompson, Maria Huxley, Marissa Hanson, Lynn Johnson, Derek Gasly,

06:57:58.217 --> 06:58:03.791
Kristen Rivers and Cassandra Salcona believes what this is.

06:58:08.083 --> 06:58:08.844
Good afternoon again.

06:58:09.004 --> 06:58:15.028
My name is Janelle Rooley, attorney with the Law Offices of Young, Middy, and Core in support of KIPP Eastside High School.

06:58:16.329 --> 06:58:20.131
We heard a little earlier the six reasons that a charter petition can be denied.

06:58:21.472 --> 06:58:24.114
That's what the law allows, and that's what we're operating in today.

06:58:24.534 --> 06:58:29.397
Within the Charter Schools Act, there are actually a few different mentions of what the legislature's intent is.

06:58:29.717 --> 06:58:31.619
The legislature declares what its intent is.

06:58:32.099 --> 06:58:37.202
None of those mentions talk about the number of charter schools within a particular school district or jurisdiction.

06:58:38.543 --> 06:58:45.450
The district's policy arguments and disagreements with the plain legal requirements are better and more appropriately before the legislature.

06:58:46.030 --> 06:58:51.074
Neither school districts nor the State Board of Education have the legal authority to decide what's enough.

06:58:51.875 --> 06:58:59.001
Only our elected officials can do that and the district is actually expending resources on a bill to do that, to advocate for a bill to do that.

06:58:59.881 --> 06:59:11.669
We ask again that you focus on this particular charter and help KIPP to fulfill a promise that it made to hundreds of middle school students in San Jose to allow them to continue on to a KIPP program for high school.

06:59:11.809 --> 06:59:12.089
Thank you.

06:59:15.936 --> 06:59:16.576
Hello, everyone.

06:59:16.596 --> 06:59:22.738
My name is Maria Yepes, and my daughter, Emily Prado, is an eighth grader at KidPrize.

06:59:24.359 --> 06:59:28.100
And I'm here as a part of the Eastside San Jose community.

06:59:29.021 --> 06:59:37.724
A couple of years ago, we were dragged into a very devastating situation as a family, and KidPrize became our main support system.

06:59:38.464 --> 06:59:43.226
Our school cares about academics, but also about my kids' well-being.

06:59:43.826 --> 06:59:46.347
her emotions, her struggles, and her family.

06:59:47.307 --> 06:59:47.467
Ms.

06:59:47.547 --> 06:59:48.268
Angrelian, Ms.

06:59:48.288 --> 07:00:01.512
Machado, with my daughter's teachers, they were there for us every step of the way of our recovery until Emily got back on her feet emotionally and her grades went back to normal.

07:00:02.293 --> 07:00:06.614
KEEP shares our family values and even we have the same goal.

07:00:07.695 --> 07:00:10.516
I'm here to ask you to say yes to our new high school.

07:00:10.896 --> 07:00:11.376
We need it.

07:00:12.222 --> 07:00:15.740
Allow Keep Navigate to help me to walk my daughter to college.

07:00:16.242 --> 07:00:16.604
Thank you.

07:00:21.820 --> 07:00:22.801
Good afternoon everyone.

07:00:23.162 --> 07:00:27.106
My name is Patricia Martinez and I am a parent at KIPP Heartwood Academy.

07:00:27.647 --> 07:00:29.489
My son's name is Santino Martinez.

07:00:29.949 --> 07:00:34.394
I would like to share my personal experience with KIPP's special education services.

07:00:35.175 --> 07:00:41.882
My child attended the local schools before attending KIPP but unfortunately he was not being provided the services he needed to meet his IEP goals.

07:00:42.643 --> 07:00:52.493
In our educational goal, if our educational goal is to prepare our children for higher education in the workforce, then we should teach our kids in a setting that prepares them for just that.

07:00:53.054 --> 07:00:58.079
I keep Santino's place in general education classes and gets pulled out for services that he needs.

07:00:58.860 --> 07:01:08.407
He is able to learn math, social studies, science, reading, and writing with the rest of his peers and still receive the support he needs to meet his IEP goals.

07:01:08.848 --> 07:01:11.309
This type of setting is a direct reflection of the real world.

07:01:11.670 --> 07:01:23.419
College students attend class with all individuals, as I did, and those that need accommodations, as I did, and services received and the same goals for the workforce as I do now.

07:01:24.139 --> 07:01:31.745
Santino started fifth grade in Cape with six goals and now he's only time with one goal and promoting to ninth grade.

07:01:31.845 --> 07:01:34.487
Please please approve this high school.

07:01:34.687 --> 07:01:35.408
Appreciate your time.

07:01:35.448 --> 07:01:36.108
Thank you for your time.

07:01:36.148 --> 07:01:36.389
Thank you.

07:01:41.394 --> 07:01:46.817
Good afternoon, my name is Isis Diaz and I'm currently a college counseling fellow at KIPP San Jose Collegiate.

07:01:47.377 --> 07:01:54.561
I attended both KIPP Heartwood Academy Middle School and KIPP San Jose Collegiate High School before going on to Notre Dame De Namur University.

07:01:55.301 --> 07:02:03.606
I returned to work at KIPP because I wanted to pay it forward and help students get to and through college just like I did and that was in big part thanks to KIPP.

07:02:04.486 --> 07:02:13.071
My eight years with KIPP were not easy, but the minute I stepped into a college classroom, it was clear that they were worth it because I was prepared for the four years that lied ahead.

07:02:14.605 --> 07:02:21.191
I'm a part of our KIPP through college team, which supports students while they are transitioning to college and while they are in college.

07:02:22.031 --> 07:02:25.494
My favorite part of my job is the fact that we are equitable in our work.

07:02:25.955 --> 07:02:31.600
It does not matter if a student has a 4.0 or is not eligible for a four-year university straight out of high school.

07:02:32.060 --> 07:02:36.844
We provide support and access to resources needed to help every single student succeed.

07:02:37.825 --> 07:02:45.070
I chose a career in education because I believe in our school systems and I believe that every single child has the right to a quality education.

07:02:45.470 --> 07:02:47.091
I'm living proof that KIPP is that place.

07:02:47.811 --> 07:02:52.534
Please allow for KIPP Navigate to open so that all our KIPPsters can continue their experience.

07:02:52.854 --> 07:02:53.215
Thank you.

07:02:59.338 --> 07:03:00.059
Good evening board.

07:03:00.259 --> 07:03:01.640
My name is Heriberto Soto.

07:03:03.992 --> 07:03:06.794
In two years, my daughter is gonna be looking for a high school.

07:03:07.895 --> 07:03:11.637
My daughter's got a good foundation from K-Middle School.

07:03:12.538 --> 07:03:15.340
My older son, he just graduated and went to UC Merced.

07:03:15.840 --> 07:03:21.224
So sometimes we must wanna say that everything is the same.

07:03:21.304 --> 07:03:23.386
In this school, they give us really good education.

07:03:30.603 --> 07:03:39.427
Even though, you know, when we have the Hispanic people we have in tact that we are not to learn, KIPP have proved the opposite.

07:03:40.888 --> 07:03:48.412
Our children are going to four-year universities, and so we don't want to say that some other people are smarter.

07:03:48.472 --> 07:03:51.293
So we know we have to work harder, but we are getting there.

07:03:51.433 --> 07:03:52.574
Please approve the school.

07:03:53.134 --> 07:03:56.076
Make sure that most of our kids have a great education.

07:03:57.233 --> 07:03:59.095
We wait for Superman for too many years.

07:03:59.375 --> 07:04:05.321
After I was looking at the APIs, I understood that I had to look for something else.

07:04:05.461 --> 07:04:07.663
We need big solutions for big problems.

07:04:07.703 --> 07:04:08.244
Thank you very much.

07:04:12.674 --> 07:04:17.917
Hello, my name is Melissa Alvarenga and I am the Community Engagement Manager at KIPP Bay Area Schools.

07:04:18.298 --> 07:04:26.383
I want to talk about the work that I've been doing in the Eastside Union High School District with families, community organizations, and alongside Ms.

07:04:26.423 --> 07:04:29.145
Verrocki in preparation of KIPP Navigate College Prep.

07:04:29.745 --> 07:04:34.749
Students and families have been part of every single step of the process creating a vision and design for the school.

07:04:35.609 --> 07:04:44.832
Our goal is to be a school of the community and not just in the community and build it together and make sure it reflects the needs and the interests of the people you see in this room.

07:04:45.632 --> 07:04:58.415
We held multiple meetings at each one of our middle schools and also in local youth centers and community centers where families had the opportunity to be decision makers and advocates in the political arena and many inspired to run for office themselves.

07:04:59.096 --> 07:05:03.557
I hope you keep these same families and students at the forefront as you make the final decision today.

07:05:03.937 --> 07:05:04.237
Thank you.

07:05:11.155 --> 07:05:20.466
Good afternoon board my name is Katie Peterson and I'm a nationally certified school psychologist who has supported our KIPP schools in San Jose over the past four years.

07:05:21.347 --> 07:05:28.275
As advocate of students with disabilities and mental health needs my first priority is to ensure that the needs of all of our students

07:05:28.835 --> 07:05:29.396
are being met.

07:05:29.976 --> 07:05:35.079
Our team members do whatever it takes to support students' special needs.

07:05:36.080 --> 07:05:38.301
As our saying goes, we find a way or make one.

07:05:39.122 --> 07:05:46.067
We have partnered with the Diagnostic Center of Northern California to build a program supporting students on the autism spectrum from the ground up.

07:05:46.647 --> 07:05:54.512
We have and continue to train our teachers and staff on evidence-based practices to ensure that our students are thriving in our care.

07:05:55.313 --> 07:05:58.135
I came here today to be a voice for students with disabilities.

07:05:59.596 --> 07:06:13.685
Your vote in favor of KIPP Navigate College Prep will allow us to provide a continuum of care and support for our students with disabilities and their families with whom we have had the privilege of building relationships over the past four or more years.

07:06:14.226 --> 07:06:15.787
Thank you very much for your consideration.

07:06:21.081 --> 07:06:26.885
Buenas tardes, voy a hablar en español porque mi inglés es un poco mocho todavía.

07:06:27.666 --> 07:06:31.208
Voy a hacer un talk con mi compañera.

07:06:31.728 --> 07:06:33.029
Hola, buenas tardes.

07:06:33.049 --> 07:06:34.290
Mi nombre es Carmen Davalos.

07:06:34.330 --> 07:06:36.332
Soy madre soltera y tengo dos niños.

07:06:36.452 --> 07:06:40.695
Uno atiende a la escuela de Rocketship y uno está atendiendo a la escuela de Keep Harvard.

07:06:41.756 --> 07:06:46.001
Yo siempre he dado la, inculcado la educación a mis hijos.

07:06:47.642 --> 07:06:51.767
Tengo mi niña, se llama Atsiri, ella ha tenido la pasión por la educación siempre.

07:06:52.168 --> 07:06:57.033
Ella cuando comenzó con Rocketship ha demostrado que es muy lista para aprender.

07:06:58.695 --> 07:07:00.956
Ella tiene una muy buena fundación académica.

07:07:01.036 --> 07:07:07.198
Ella terminó cuarto grado a nivel de octavo grado en literatura y matemáticas en sexto.

07:07:07.658 --> 07:07:14.581
Kim Naviguer es mi opción que yo quiero para mi hija para que ella siga creciendo académicamente y tenga un futuro lleno de opciones.

07:07:15.001 --> 07:07:20.783
Estoy orgullosa de que mi hija ha logrado esto con su gran esfuerzo, teniendo un 95% en todas sus clases.

07:07:22.604 --> 07:07:36.401
Ya estamos hablando acerca de la cual universidad ella va a ir ella quiere ir a la universidad de Santa Clara yo quiero que vaya a Stanford por eso pero ya dice que no quiere irse lejos de mami

07:07:37.847 --> 07:07:46.096
Por eso estoy tomando mi tiempo, mi día de trabajo hoy, para representar a muchos padres que no pudieron llegar hoy porque no pudieron.

07:07:46.717 --> 07:07:49.220
Si se venían de trabajar, los podían correr.

07:07:49.661 --> 07:07:55.067
So estoy aquí porque pienso representándolos a los papás que no pudieron llegar.

07:07:56.533 --> 07:08:01.536
Pido su apoyo para nuestros estudiantes que serán los próximos profesionales.

07:08:02.657 --> 07:08:07.520
Y pido la aprobación para esta escuela que es la luz al final del mundo para nosotros.

07:08:07.740 --> 07:08:08.100
Gracias.

07:08:09.588 --> 07:08:17.292
Hi, my name is Carmen, and I am a single mother, and I have two children.

07:08:17.713 --> 07:08:20.975
At City is attending KPA, KIPP.

07:08:21.695 --> 07:08:25.697
I have always included the importance of education to my children.

07:08:25.937 --> 07:08:28.739
At City has always had a passion for school.

07:08:28.939 --> 07:08:30.580
She started at Rocket Ship.

07:08:30.820 --> 07:08:33.642
She has a good academic foundation.

07:08:34.242 --> 07:08:39.065
She finished fourth grade with an eighth grade level in literature.

07:08:39.745 --> 07:08:49.691
KIPP Navigate is my option that I want for my daughter so she can keep growing academically and so she can have a future full of options.

07:08:50.231 --> 07:08:51.952
I am proud of my daughter.

07:08:52.552 --> 07:09:02.299
what she has achieved till now, having 95% in all of her classes, we are now talking about what university she will be attending.

07:09:02.920 --> 07:09:08.704
She wants to attend Santa Clara, but I want her to attend Stanford.

07:09:10.386 --> 07:09:13.228
She doesn't, however, want to go far away from me.

07:09:14.208 --> 07:09:17.531
That is why I am here, taking a day off of work

07:09:18.112 --> 07:09:21.894
representing a lot of the parents that could not attend.

07:09:22.515 --> 07:09:27.698
I ask for you to support our students since they will be our next professionals.

07:09:28.578 --> 07:09:34.942
For the parents of the future, for the parents of low income, KIPP is our light at the end of the tunnel.

07:09:37.464 --> 07:09:37.744
Thank you.

07:09:46.093 --> 07:09:49.576
Good afternoon, respected State Board of Education members.

07:09:49.756 --> 07:09:50.977
My name is Farouk Khadri.

07:09:51.658 --> 07:09:55.041
First of all, I would like to thank you guys to give me this forum to speak to you.

07:09:55.481 --> 07:09:59.024
I am a proud parent of four boys that are in the KIPP system.

07:09:59.445 --> 07:10:07.331
Two are in the high school, one is in a middle school, and one graduated from KIPP high school and is attending UCLA at this point.

07:10:07.872 --> 07:10:13.417
It was the hard work of the teachers, the staff members, the counselors, and the leadership of KIPP that made

07:10:14.557 --> 07:10:17.759
it possible for my son to be able to attend UC.

07:10:18.959 --> 07:10:22.261
KIPP is one of the schools that just does not get them to college.

07:10:22.401 --> 07:10:34.767
It is one school, I don't know if any other high school does this, makes a mentor for that graduate to go and be with him for the four year until he graduates from university.

07:10:35.467 --> 07:10:37.189
which is a big thing for me.

07:10:37.649 --> 07:10:47.019
With the help of this board today, we will be able to open another such jewel in the Eastside Union High School, which will provide parents a choice that is best for their child.

07:10:48.921 --> 07:10:54.226
I strongly believe that this KIPP Navigate is, you should approve that and thank you again for your time.

07:10:59.485 --> 07:11:04.908
Good afternoon, my name is Elia Reda and I am the founding operations manager and a KIPP parent myself.

07:11:05.508 --> 07:11:08.910
KIPP schools have played a very impactful role in my family.

07:11:09.150 --> 07:11:16.895
As a single mother raising two girls, their academic success had always been my number one priority and I decided that KIPP was a natural fit to how I raised my daughters.

07:11:17.515 --> 07:11:21.738
As my daughters attended King High School, they faced social, emotional challenges.

07:11:22.738 --> 07:11:25.860
Many times I felt hopeless not knowing what I could do next to help my daughters.

07:11:26.621 --> 07:11:32.424
The support and love that my daughters and I received from the teachers, counselors, and admin was beyond what I could have wished for.

07:11:32.824 --> 07:11:36.627
The saying, it takes a village to raise a child was true in our case.

07:11:37.107 --> 07:11:43.451
My daughters and I could not have done it without the village that loved us, supported us, and pushed us through those very dark times.

07:11:44.071 --> 07:11:49.397
My daughter's graduations and trips, taking them to college were for me the proudest moments ever.

07:11:49.638 --> 07:11:55.084
I was proud, I was happy, I was excited because the dream of watching my girls go to college was coming alive.

07:11:55.925 --> 07:12:00.691
And I felt so blessed and grateful for the KIPP Village that helped me get my little girls to college.

07:12:01.151 --> 07:12:03.514
Please support the opening of KIPP Navigate College Prep.

07:12:03.755 --> 07:12:04.055
Thank you.

07:12:10.031 --> 07:12:11.211
Good afternoon, board members.

07:12:11.531 --> 07:12:12.532
My name is Aiden Mai.

07:12:12.832 --> 07:12:18.173
I am a 12-year-old 8th grader and a member of the founding class of KIPP Prize Preparatory Academy in San Jose.

07:12:18.733 --> 07:12:22.635
I started my journey with KIPP in August of 2015, and it has been quite the ride.

07:12:23.135 --> 07:12:30.737
I can tell you right now that I am not the same little 6th grader who first walked into KIPP, and I have grown so much at KIPP, not only intellectually, but as a person as well.

07:12:31.457 --> 07:12:36.502
KIPP is constantly highlighting themes of social justice and change in its curriculum, even in math class.

07:12:37.062 --> 07:12:41.226
All of us have taken the guidance of our teachers to change the world for ourselves and others to heart.

07:12:41.907 --> 07:12:47.451
Early this morning, my 8th grade class led a protest in San Jose to call for the tightening of gun laws in America.

07:12:48.132 --> 07:12:54.395
KIPP is educating the future leaders of this country and your approval vote would allow more and more kids to achieve their ambitious dreams.

07:12:54.755 --> 07:13:01.158
Mahatma Gandhi and Barack Obama have told us to be the change that we wish to see and that is what KIPP is training us to do.

07:13:01.638 --> 07:13:04.860
Your vote would have a huge impact on my classmates and I. Thank you for your time.

07:13:11.281 --> 07:13:11.942
Good afternoon.

07:13:12.122 --> 07:13:13.163
My name is Lynn Johnson.

07:13:13.203 --> 07:13:18.866
I'm a teacher at Oak Grove High School in Eastside Union High School District, but more importantly than that I am also a parent.

07:13:18.886 --> 07:13:25.871
I have two students who attended the Eastside Union High School District, one who graduated from Oak Grove High School where I teach and where they are

07:13:27.012 --> 07:13:29.253
planning to cram in the newest KIPP school.

07:13:30.094 --> 07:13:31.415
He is currently a U.S.

07:13:31.475 --> 07:13:34.977
Marine firefighter serving your country and keeping you all safe.

07:13:35.517 --> 07:13:41.840
His twin graduated from Mount Pleasant High School and is currently a civil engineering student at Oregon State University.

07:13:42.141 --> 07:13:45.563
If you want to look for choice in schools, there's choice in schools.

07:13:47.204 --> 07:13:52.627
First of all, the other thing I'd like to say is, in my opinion, there are no traditionally underserved pupils in the Eastside Union High School District.

07:13:52.707 --> 07:13:55.068
I'm actually an alumni from a bazillion years ago.

07:13:55.988 --> 07:14:01.632
And if all KIPP is trying to do is find a home for their middle schoolers, they're not actually serving people in the Eastside Union High School District.

07:14:02.272 --> 07:14:06.715
But what I really wanted to talk about was the fact that there is no space at our school at Oak Grove for this school.

07:14:07.215 --> 07:14:15.560
They are going to get rid of our emotionally disturbed program, they're gonna move them onto campus where those kids are gonna be surrounded all day, as well as our counseling program.

07:14:15.800 --> 07:14:16.080
Thank you.

07:14:22.048 --> 07:14:24.069
Hi my name is Kristen Rivers.

07:14:25.470 --> 07:14:31.773
I am also a national board certified teacher who actually is not currently teaching but I'm here as a parent.

07:14:31.813 --> 07:14:37.797
I have three children in the Eastside Union High School District and

07:14:38.877 --> 07:14:55.709
I just really wanted to emphasize I had my daughter in a charter school so I am not anti-charter but as a public school teacher I have also seen what happens to the resources and the kids and the parents and the involved families when charters open up.

07:14:56.269 --> 07:15:03.593
And I want to offer that this, if they build it, they will come, we have seen, is not bearing out in the east side.

07:15:03.953 --> 07:15:05.454
We have enough charter schools.

07:15:05.954 --> 07:15:14.638
What we need is attention to the schools that are already there and doing amazing, wonderful things, as I have seen with my own children.

07:15:15.119 --> 07:15:15.579
So thank you.

07:15:22.298 --> 07:15:23.899
Hello, my name is Marisa Hansen.

07:15:24.519 --> 07:15:29.562
I'm a teacher in the district as well as a community member and a parent of a special education student.

07:15:30.162 --> 07:15:35.925
And as you might have seen in the petition, special education does not mirror what we offer in Eastside.

07:15:36.685 --> 07:15:41.588
A child like my son who would be accepted in Eastside wouldn't be accepted in KIPP.

07:15:41.708 --> 07:15:43.048
They don't offer the services.

07:15:43.469 --> 07:15:45.690
So that is a reason in itself to deny it.

07:15:45.830 --> 07:15:47.651
It does not mirror what the district has.

07:15:48.451 --> 07:15:50.494
Also, like we talked about, there is choice.

07:15:50.594 --> 07:15:50.914
There are 12.

07:15:50.975 --> 07:15:53.958
The current KIPP has room.

07:15:53.978 --> 07:15:56.682
50 of those students are not Eastside.

07:15:56.962 --> 07:15:57.543
At least 50.

07:15:57.823 --> 07:15:59.045
There could even be more.

07:15:59.685 --> 07:16:02.929
Our district was willing to consider increasing that KIPP number.

07:16:03.650 --> 07:16:09.173
if we remove the students that were not Eastside and we added in the students that they said they needed to do.

07:16:09.513 --> 07:16:12.455
So we were open to compromising, but they were not.

07:16:12.895 --> 07:16:19.938
At the county board, they actually encouraged the county board to deny them so they could come before you and let you approve them.

07:16:20.198 --> 07:16:20.859
They said that.

07:16:20.979 --> 07:16:22.620
I hope all of you watched that video.

07:16:22.780 --> 07:16:23.100
Thank you.

07:16:28.499 --> 07:16:30.220
Hi, my name is Derek Grasty.

07:16:30.340 --> 07:16:33.942
I'm a parent, educator, and community leader.

07:16:34.362 --> 07:16:37.043
Both my sons are graduates of the Eastside Union High School District.

07:16:37.303 --> 07:16:38.904
They're both college graduates and beyond.

07:16:39.324 --> 07:16:40.805
Eastside offers a wonderful program.

07:16:41.825 --> 07:16:43.746
The charter does not offer real choice.

07:16:44.126 --> 07:16:51.290
Choice would be a performing arts academy or a STEM or STEAM magnet school.

07:16:51.590 --> 07:16:52.270
They're not offering that.

07:16:52.290 --> 07:16:54.611
They're trying to replicate what the district already does.

07:16:54.791 --> 07:16:55.732
There's already choice there.

07:16:55.952 --> 07:16:58.813
And they're not doing it at the high level that the district can provide it.

07:16:59.173 --> 07:17:00.194
There is no science lab.

07:17:00.834 --> 07:17:02.175
Music is not there.

07:17:03.015 --> 07:17:03.915
Sports is not there.

07:17:04.295 --> 07:17:06.857
And in terms of special education, that's already been stated.

07:17:06.897 --> 07:17:12.079
But it's very telling that a psychologist spoke and not a special education teacher because they don't have one.

07:17:12.239 --> 07:17:12.479
Thank you.

07:17:14.403 --> 07:17:17.529
Would the last group of speakers for item 6 please line up?

07:17:17.910 --> 07:17:26.726
Patty Cortese, Bill Simmons, Michael Ho, Naja Ali,

07:17:27.742 --> 07:17:53.477
Gripal Kaur, Tina La, Valera Cortez, Jessica Galbaran, Shannon Fan, Teresa Martin, Nathan Bellamonte, Israel Alvarez, Anne Finney, Lisa Baker, Serena Gonzalez, Manuel Dominguez, Kevin Murphy, and Anna Marie Edzer-Bezal.

07:17:57.008 --> 07:17:58.770
Good afternoon honor board members.

07:17:58.870 --> 07:17:59.971
My name is Quynh Mai.

07:17:59.991 --> 07:18:03.094
I'm a parent of four thriving students at KIPP.

07:18:03.754 --> 07:18:18.048
Over the years our family has experienced various school models from public to private and charter and found that KIPP's most effective in bringing out the scholar in our students as well as offer supports to those that need the extra help.

07:18:18.729 --> 07:18:34.488
Our Bay Area community loves it, that keeps high quality of education, is accessible, free and open to all, with a student body a true reflection of the local community, with all of its diversity, special needs and strengths.

07:18:35.069 --> 07:18:41.331
The argument that keeps new school will take resources away from public school should not be relevant in this petition.

07:18:41.731 --> 07:18:49.074
We need to learn to share resources and enable all students, not to limiting our choices for our kids.

07:18:50.461 --> 07:18:57.630
Being from Silicon Valley, which is known for its innovation, we should embrace healthy competition in education.

07:18:57.990 --> 07:19:04.859
It should not be divisive debate of public versus charter school, but a collaborative partnership for our children's future.

07:19:05.640 --> 07:19:07.082
We hope to count on your approval.

07:19:07.122 --> 07:19:07.422
Thank you.

07:19:13.936 --> 07:19:21.180
Good evening board, my name is Juanita Rodriguez and I am reading this letter from Trustee Grace Ma from Santa Clara County Board of Education.

07:19:21.721 --> 07:19:37.650
I appreciate your board work in supporting sound charter schools, promoting innovative and willingness to approve petitions which meet the intent of the charter school law to provide choice to communities along with improving pupil learning

07:19:38.210 --> 07:19:40.252
with innovative practices.

07:19:40.612 --> 07:19:55.404
I also appreciate your boards cutting through various red hearings of administrative controls that are being imposed on charter control that are not stated in ed code for charters and are specifically left in a gray zone of regulations.

07:19:55.924 --> 07:20:04.891
I hope that with an approval of charter school on appeal to your board that you would for the record state your decision based on the fundamental tense

07:20:05.732 --> 07:20:09.915
of the law choice for communities and improving pupils outcomes.

07:20:10.415 --> 07:20:11.616
Thank you, Grace Ma.

07:20:11.937 --> 07:20:14.638
And I'm also a parent from a student that's at Kipp Price.

07:20:15.359 --> 07:20:16.220
Please approve the charter.

07:20:16.420 --> 07:20:16.700
Thank you.

07:20:19.892 --> 07:20:25.717
Good afternoon, my name is Marie Kawase Huxley and I'm the Chief of Schools for Kitt Bay Area Schools.

07:20:26.477 --> 07:20:32.442
We are committed to getting all of our students to and through college.

07:20:33.063 --> 07:20:38.327
You heard this commitment and some of the voices today from students, staff, and families.

07:20:39.168 --> 07:20:40.769
Our student retention rate is 91%.

07:20:42.451 --> 07:20:48.255
The majority of our families that leave report the reason for leaving is due to relocation.

07:20:49.378 --> 07:20:55.208
As a region of schools, we are committed to restorative practices and to social emotional learning.

07:20:55.609 --> 07:20:58.333
We're proud of the strength of our school communities.

07:20:59.315 --> 07:21:01.699
Please vote to approve our KIPP High School.

07:21:01.919 --> 07:21:02.260
Thank you.

07:21:07.296 --> 07:21:11.380
Good afternoon, I'm Beth Thompson, the founder and CEO of Kip Bay Area Schools.

07:21:12.061 --> 07:21:25.975
After 10 years of working closely with the Eastside Union High School District and having received a positive staff recommendation for our proposed high school, we were surprised and disappointed by their board's decision to deny our charter petition without findings.

07:21:26.616 --> 07:21:38.728
We have a long track record of success in East San Jose and pledge to continue to hold ourselves to the highest standard of transparency and excellence when it comes to our academic, financial, and operational outcomes.

07:21:39.429 --> 07:21:50.860
We are deeply committed to responding to our middle school parents and providing a KIPP high school option for all of our middle school students in East San Jose, which is why we are petitioning for the approval

07:21:51.400 --> 07:21:53.144
of KIPP Navigate College Prep.

07:21:53.805 --> 07:21:59.437
Over 250 families have already submitted enrollment applications for our proposed school.

07:21:59.918 --> 07:22:01.501
Please let their voices be heard.

07:22:01.762 --> 07:22:02.123
Thank you.

07:22:08.274 --> 07:22:12.957
Good afternoon, Patty Cortese, Vice President of the Eastside Union High School District Board.

07:22:13.917 --> 07:22:24.583
I'm here to add my personal perspective as a board member and a 20-year volunteer in a mentoring program in the district, working with students who have greatly struggled with school.

07:22:25.913 --> 07:22:34.862
Due to declining enrollment and other factors, our district is facing layoffs, including many positions that support some of our most vulnerable students.

07:22:35.763 --> 07:22:40.527
Positions like counselors, advisors, and activities directors among them.

07:22:41.328 --> 07:22:44.631
An additional charter would only exacerbate this situation.

07:22:45.652 --> 07:23:00.298
As a board member, I am responsible for ensuring a high quality education for all of our students, especially the students I have worked with in the past, those who need these vital services in order to succeed.

07:23:01.713 --> 07:23:11.082
Opening a new school under these circumstances would be imprudent and an injustice to the 23,000 students in our comprehensive schools.

07:23:11.903 --> 07:23:17.428
Non-cooperation with unjust laws is one of the most powerful tools for social change.

07:23:17.948 --> 07:23:18.269
Thank you.

07:23:24.107 --> 07:23:31.556
Good afternoon board members my name is Michael Huynh and I am here to shed some light on the negative impacts of KIPP on at Independence.

07:23:31.876 --> 07:23:39.165
As a student athlete and being a team captain I've seen the negative impacts on not only my athletes as well as my fellow peers.

07:23:39.986 --> 07:23:46.630
During my sophomore year, my track team was only able to practice at the most two times on our own track.

07:23:47.651 --> 07:23:51.914
Track has very technical events and requires the track to be used.

07:23:51.954 --> 07:23:56.577
However, our facilities are never available to us or rarely available to us.

07:23:56.897 --> 07:24:02.661
Not to mention a couple days ago, I took my team out on a run on an outer perimeter of the campus, including KIPP.

07:24:03.041 --> 07:24:09.285
When I ran by, we were looked down upon and we were given, we were kind of made fun of, my own team.

07:24:10.455 --> 07:24:11.129
not to mention

07:24:13.654 --> 07:24:17.675
Aside from sports, there's also a negative impact on the environment at Independence.

07:24:20.096 --> 07:24:30.098
During class, I can hear people from KIPP very loud, disruptive, sometimes they're playing ball and they kick around our door, and it's very disruptive to the learning environment.

07:24:30.958 --> 07:24:38.399
Furthermore, Independence encourages students to do extracurricular activities and opportunities never being the limiting factor.

07:24:38.819 --> 07:24:42.340
We uphold the notion of fair education for everyone, but I ask, will KIPP

07:24:48.783 --> 07:24:49.383
Good afternoon.

07:24:49.663 --> 07:24:50.563
My name is Najmal Ali.

07:24:50.823 --> 07:24:57.825
I'm a senior at Oak Grove High School, and at my school we already have summit charters on our campus who have already taken over 25 of 30 portables.

07:24:58.205 --> 07:25:01.646
We share our gym, our equipment, our fields, and many other resources with them.

07:25:02.006 --> 07:25:05.726
This sharing itself has limited my access to my own school's facilities.

07:25:06.206 --> 07:25:14.148
My school's black student union wanted to hold an art show for Black History Month, and we weren't able to use our own school's small gym due to the charter's extensive reservations.

07:25:14.668 --> 07:25:21.052
Having the charter on campus has also created more congestion and traffic around school, not only for students and teachers, but for our surrounding community.

07:25:21.452 --> 07:25:26.735
This is a hazard on its own, but this traffic has increased torities for myself and many of my fellow classmates.

07:25:27.155 --> 07:25:31.938
Every three torities equals an absence, and every eight unexcused absences resorts you to truant status.

07:25:32.298 --> 07:25:34.380
Students are being disciplined unfairly as a result.

07:25:34.720 --> 07:25:41.364
If we allow KIPP on our campus, it would not only further limit student access to resources, but continue to penalize students for conditions they have no control over.

07:25:41.884 --> 07:25:46.770
Every decision made needs to be in the best interest of our community and KIPP school is not in the best interest of our community at all.

07:25:53.097 --> 07:25:55.260
Hi I'm Gripal and I'm a junior at Independence High.

07:25:55.420 --> 07:25:57.402
The charter schools have affected me and my family.

07:25:57.542 --> 07:26:02.007
I play basketball and our practices are inconsistent because we have to share the gym time.

07:26:03.306 --> 07:26:05.227
And we don't know when our practices are going to end.

07:26:05.328 --> 07:26:07.629
My parents both go to work around 3 in the morning.

07:26:08.029 --> 07:26:09.010
So I get home around 10.

07:26:09.230 --> 07:26:12.272
And I barely have time to do homework, let alone eat dinner.

07:26:12.332 --> 07:26:15.615
So some nights, I go home and don't eat dinner and go straight to work.

07:26:16.515 --> 07:26:17.276
Thank you for your time.

07:26:22.560 --> 07:26:23.320
Good afternoon.

07:26:23.420 --> 07:26:24.141
My name is Tina.

07:26:25.191 --> 07:26:27.172
and I'm a sophomore at Independence.

07:26:27.932 --> 07:26:36.017
As a former student at KIPP San Jose Collegiate, I have experienced the environment of both public and charter school.

07:26:36.537 --> 07:26:44.641
For the three months at KIPP, I felt limited to the opportunities of multiple extracurricular activities and learning academies.

07:26:45.208 --> 07:26:52.230
Public school like Independence High School has opened new doors allowing me to interact with new people, teachers, and coaches.

07:26:53.230 --> 07:26:58.332
The social impact of a public school is its diversity and ethnicities.

07:26:59.352 --> 07:27:09.475
The fact that KIPP only accepts students who meet their academic requirements shows that KIPP has failed to uphold the notion of providing fair education for all.

07:27:09.835 --> 07:27:10.195
Thank you.

07:27:14.281 --> 07:27:15.882
Hello, my name is Valeria Cortez.

07:27:15.902 --> 07:27:21.064
I go to Independence High School, which currently houses three of the 12 charter schools in our district.

07:27:21.244 --> 07:27:27.267
Living in the East Side San Jose, my family once believed that charter schools provided a better education than public schools.

07:27:27.948 --> 07:27:32.130
Every one of my siblings have attended a charter school at one point in their academic lives.

07:27:32.690 --> 07:27:37.032
As a witness to their experience, the shift from a charter school to a public school was eye-opening.

07:27:37.673 --> 07:27:42.215
KIPP's condescending attitude towards public schools, especially their host campus, Independence,

07:27:42.815 --> 07:27:43.616
is unacceptable.

07:27:43.756 --> 07:27:49.662
Their claims to have a better education is poured upon our parents, but in reality, education is what the students make of it.

07:27:50.322 --> 07:28:02.594
Charter schools limit their education to college recommendations, but the benefit of teaching academies, AVE programs, AP, sheltered classes, and so much more, gives students the opportunity to learn at their own pace and find their passion.

07:28:03.334 --> 07:28:09.845
Education is priority and the students and parents should not be obliged to follow the slogans circulated in the community by these schools.

07:28:10.967 --> 07:28:14.012
Accepting KIPP's petition will only find us here again.

07:28:14.493 --> 07:28:17.118
Thank you for listening to our experiences and observations.

07:28:23.871 --> 07:28:26.834
Hi, my name is Jessica, a current student at Independence High School.

07:28:27.174 --> 07:28:36.803
My mom and an alumni at Independence High School asked me if we still use the planetarium and if elementary kids still use it for a good learning experience of seeing and discovering stars.

07:28:37.243 --> 07:28:38.004
My answer was no.

07:28:39.085 --> 07:28:46.810
The charter schools have converted into a classroom, taking away the experience of the planetarium that my mom once experienced.

07:28:47.270 --> 07:28:53.874
Knowing that I could have had that experience, it makes me sad that it was taken away from me, others, and younger generations.

07:28:54.215 --> 07:28:54.555
Thank you.

07:28:58.052 --> 07:28:59.813
Hi, my name is Shannon Fan.

07:28:59.914 --> 07:29:01.515
I'm a sophomore at Independence High School.

07:29:02.035 --> 07:29:07.940
And on behalf of the students at Independence, we believe that expanding the charter schools on our campus will increase unnecessary tensions.

07:29:08.521 --> 07:29:15.626
This greatly affects student-athletes and our school events due to the charter school having equal access, having our practices and rehearsals late.

07:29:17.668 --> 07:29:21.812
They have equal access which means that we have to rotate schedules.

07:29:22.292 --> 07:29:27.777
This causes us to have irregular times for practices and rehearsals meaning our parents never know when to pick us up.

07:29:28.257 --> 07:29:31.140
We end up staying at school way too long 15 hours or more.

07:29:31.740 --> 07:29:37.185
By having practices and rehearsals late it affects us as student athletes causing us to come home tired and late.

07:29:38.106 --> 07:29:43.831
Charter schools are extremely affecting us at Independence High School and I hope other schools will not have to face the same disturbance.

07:29:44.872 --> 07:29:45.352
Oh thank you.

07:29:51.363 --> 07:29:54.946
Good afternoon my name is Theresa Martin and I'm a senior at Independence High School.

07:29:55.527 --> 07:29:59.550
I'm here today to share issues about the charter schools being at our campus.

07:30:00.011 --> 07:30:10.360
When I was a freshman at Independence I was on the girls volleyball team and our practices were right after school so I had time to do my homework to eat dinner with my whole family and get enough sleep.

07:30:11.261 --> 07:30:15.204
My brother is a current freshman at Independence, and he is on the volleyball team as well.

07:30:15.684 --> 07:30:20.107
He has practices from 7.30 to 9.30 p.m., and he doesn't get home till 10 o'clock.

07:30:20.807 --> 07:30:26.491
Because we now have to share our gym with charter schools, my brother isn't able to do the things I got to do.

07:30:26.731 --> 07:30:37.638
He gets home super tired and eats dinner alone sometimes, and it's a hassle for me and my mom to wait at school till 10 o'clock because she's at home cooking or taking care of my other siblings.

07:30:38.379 --> 07:30:44.227
I believe that we should be the priority first, independent students, since it is our gym and it is our school.

07:30:44.628 --> 07:30:50.176
The issue with the charter schools affects not only my family but others as well and we shouldn't have to constantly deal with it.

07:30:50.977 --> 07:30:51.618
Thank you for your time.

07:30:53.530 --> 07:30:55.270
Good evening, my name is Nathan Balmonte.

07:30:55.450 --> 07:30:57.191
I'm currently a senior at Independence High School.

07:30:57.871 --> 07:31:02.512
As you know, we've recently been experiencing many issues concerning charter schools and comprehensive high schools.

07:31:03.252 --> 07:31:06.413
As a public school student, I've witnessed many issues throughout my four years of high school.

07:31:07.113 --> 07:31:13.315
They've stated that KIPP builds character, that they have different opportunities, and that they can progress in the next level of education.

07:31:15.575 --> 07:31:23.181
While attending a public school, I believe you can acquire the same characteristics, we have programs like AVID, Teaching Academy, Academy of Finance, and many more.

07:31:23.761 --> 07:31:27.484
That can build your work ethic and that can teach you to plan for the future.

07:31:27.864 --> 07:31:29.806
This can also shape you into a better individual.

07:31:30.486 --> 07:31:35.830
All I'm pushing for is that if charter schools would like to expand, at least consider the negatives that would result.

07:31:36.310 --> 07:31:43.696
Consider the students that will be cut of their counselors, their programs, and their benefits, just for a charter school that offers the same type of attention and education.

07:31:44.117 --> 07:31:46.111
to come and take time out of our very own programs.

07:31:46.353 --> 07:31:46.635
Thank you.

07:31:54.056 --> 07:31:55.397
Hello, my name is Israel Alvarez.

07:31:55.537 --> 07:31:57.318
I'm a student of Mount Pleasant High School.

07:31:57.919 --> 07:32:09.586
During my elementary school, I was lured to attend my local charter middle school that marketed and prouded themselves towards the local elementary schools of being an elite middle school compared to the surrounding middle schools.

07:32:10.047 --> 07:32:12.929
However, after my graduation, I decided on attending a public school instead.

07:32:13.469 --> 07:32:23.636
I was disgusted in continuing charter schools because of the artificial environment the school developed within by recommending multiple students to move to another school because of the lack of good grades.

07:32:24.977 --> 07:32:34.504
In addition to the three years of schooling, many of these recommendations were pushed on lower grade, lower performing students on the weeks towards important state testing.

07:32:34.824 --> 07:32:41.969
Miraculously, on test week, multiple of these students have moved to the nearby public school.

07:32:42.690 --> 07:32:49.355
As a result of these recommendations to lower performing students and marketing towards younger, naive students of an elite education,

07:32:50.115 --> 07:32:58.399
It creates a bubble of excellent students in charter schools and leaves the public system with demotivated students that degrades the public and schooling system.

07:33:05.242 --> 07:33:05.802
Good afternoon.

07:33:05.903 --> 07:33:06.743
I'm Anne Finney.

07:33:06.783 --> 07:33:08.864
I'm the Athletic Director at Independence High School.

07:33:09.710 --> 07:33:11.231
And we are good neighbors.

07:33:11.332 --> 07:33:13.634
We've worked hard with the other charters on our campus.

07:33:13.674 --> 07:33:16.256
We have three, but it just doesn't work.

07:33:16.737 --> 07:33:24.364
We were told it was because of declining enrollment, but what people forget is the number of activities and sport activities does not decrease.

07:33:25.064 --> 07:33:29.749
So we have two gyms, which is a luxury I get, but when we have

07:33:31.221 --> 07:33:34.703
are five basketball teams plus 10 more from the charters.

07:33:35.204 --> 07:33:41.948
There's just not enough time in the day for the kids to get a good school day practice and be able to have time at home.

07:33:42.509 --> 07:33:43.910
We have to rotate our schedules.

07:33:43.950 --> 07:33:46.151
We have our basketball team coming in at six a.m.

07:33:46.811 --> 07:33:47.792
And going to class at 7 20.

07:33:49.053 --> 07:33:53.716
We have kids starting at 7 20 and having to wait until 7 30 to start their practices.

07:33:54.296 --> 07:33:56.198
It's not a good picture for anybody.

07:33:56.758 --> 07:33:58.179
The same thing happens with soccer.

07:33:58.219 --> 07:34:00.601
We have three fields, but we have

07:34:02.242 --> 07:34:05.906
16 teams, counting the charter schools, needing that time on the field space.

07:34:06.407 --> 07:34:09.350
If somebody has to gain, everybody has to compromise.

07:34:10.111 --> 07:34:14.095
What I'm saying is it's just not good for kids on either side.

07:34:14.575 --> 07:34:14.836
Thank you.

07:34:21.218 --> 07:34:24.601
Hi, I'm Serena Bugunis, and I'm a senior at Independence High School.

07:34:25.061 --> 07:34:33.709
I'm a student athlete, so I remember freshman year when Kip and other people had to use our gym.

07:34:33.889 --> 07:34:42.096
Our practice started at 7 and ended kind of at 9.30, and I didn't have a ride home, so I had to walk.

07:34:42.376 --> 07:34:44.378
My house is about a two-hour walk from the school.

07:34:45.219 --> 07:35:03.060
also Kip does have different breaks and lunches as us so again I'm a student athlete and a student comes first an athlete and during their luncheon break we hear them playing the soccer ball kicking it on the door and it's very disruptive and you know

07:35:05.854 --> 07:35:09.816
Sorry, it's very disruptive and it's very hard to concentrate.

07:35:11.037 --> 07:35:20.642
Hearing the loud bang and no teachers or no administration will tell them to stop or anything.

07:35:21.223 --> 07:35:21.523
Thank you.

07:35:28.345 --> 07:35:32.846
Hi, my name is Manuel Dominguez and I'm a three-sport athlete at Independence High School.

07:35:33.287 --> 07:35:40.669
During the football season, we needed to use our small gym because of the poor air quality, but KIPP was using it so we had to wait for about an hour until they finished up.

07:35:41.529 --> 07:35:47.831
That only didn't waste practice time, but it wasted time that I could have been doing my homework or studying for a test.

07:35:48.391 --> 07:35:51.736
Another time I was affected by KIB was during the soccer season.

07:35:52.116 --> 07:35:59.066
Because we share a field, we had many practices super late, around 7 or 7.30, and that went to about 9.30.

07:36:00.288 --> 07:36:04.754
One time we've also went to practice for less than 30 minutes and got kicked off because of them.

07:36:05.955 --> 07:36:12.221
I'm now in baseball and they wanna expand KIPP all the way to our field, but why should we allow that when we've already gave them our other field?

07:36:13.001 --> 07:36:23.350
I keep my grades up all year long to be in sports and having practices pushed back, canceled, and our field getting taken over is really disappointing to me.

07:36:23.650 --> 07:36:24.271
Thank you for your time.

07:36:31.857 --> 07:36:35.921
Good afternoon my name is Lisa Baker and I work at Independence High School also.

07:36:37.063 --> 07:36:44.551
We share our site with three charter schools and one of them being KIPP and my position at the high school is called student advisor.

07:36:45.692 --> 07:36:52.760
Recently my position was put forth on the layoff list because of the upcoming negative fiscal impact on our district.

07:36:53.600 --> 07:36:55.801
I help supervise our 100-acre campus.

07:36:56.441 --> 07:36:59.142
I'm also a liaison and work with our neediest students.

07:37:00.162 --> 07:37:05.924
They deal with issues such as depression, anxiety, alcohol and drug abuse, and social emotional issues.

07:37:06.824 --> 07:37:11.406
I work with their families as well as I connect them with our district and community services.

07:37:12.646 --> 07:37:16.088
Some of these programs are counseling with social workers, psychologists.

07:37:16.688 --> 07:37:20.269
We work with probation, prevention, and the gang task force.

07:37:22.251 --> 07:37:32.840
If my, if we allow another charter school and it really impacts our district my position will probably be eliminated which really will negatively impact our most neediest students.

07:37:33.661 --> 07:37:34.362
Thank you for your time.

07:37:41.041 --> 07:37:43.142
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Bill Simmons.

07:37:43.382 --> 07:37:47.943
I'm a sixth grade English and history teacher in the San Juan Unified School District.

07:37:48.323 --> 07:37:52.704
And I'm here in opposition to you approving another charter.

07:37:54.325 --> 07:38:00.746
You approved a charter, Pacific Paramount Collegiate Charter, in our district.

07:38:01.506 --> 07:38:07.468
And our district denied the charter because they were not financially solvent.

07:38:08.186 --> 07:38:13.293
The County Board of Education denied the charter, but this board approved the charter.

07:38:14.615 --> 07:38:18.941
That charter closed on February the 8th of this year.

07:38:19.838 --> 07:38:25.402
Our district was required to pick up the pieces of the approval by this board.

07:38:26.102 --> 07:38:40.813
This board should be listening to the local school boards, the local elected officials, and looking at, now we're looking at a district that you're gonna put into financial insolvency because you're gonna approve another charter.

07:38:41.393 --> 07:38:43.475
That is not what you should be doing.

07:38:44.796 --> 07:38:45.176
Thank you.

07:38:50.919 --> 07:38:52.640
Eric Premack, Charter Schools Development Center.

07:38:52.720 --> 07:38:57.063
In the interest of brevity, everything that I said about the prior one I'll say in here.

07:38:57.663 --> 07:39:07.089
There is something though, it's just very distressing to see adults who are supposed to be modeling behavior for children encouraging some of the types of comments that we're hearing today.

07:39:08.790 --> 07:39:13.073
It's very disturbing to see adults in the audience here encouraging children.

07:39:13.681 --> 07:39:31.248
to engage in some of the type of behavior that we're seeing here today and the types of comments that speak of charter kids as being lesser than, deserving fewer facilities, not willing to share the limited facilities that the public has available.

07:39:32.969 --> 07:39:41.672
You really have to question whether these people have a place in a public education system and whether it's appropriate for them to be in those kinds of positions.

07:39:41.752 --> 07:39:42.713
It's really disturbing.

07:39:42.853 --> 07:39:43.133
Thank you.

07:39:48.638 --> 07:39:51.741
Hi, Ramel Antoine with the California Charter Schools Association.

07:39:51.761 --> 07:40:00.208
I want to say that CCSA works with each of the charter members as they work as they want to start new schools and communities to provide quality service.

07:40:00.268 --> 07:40:08.415
KIPP is one of those schools that has worked with us throughout the entire process to meet all the elements of the charter law and to ensure that they can gain approval

07:40:09.095 --> 07:40:15.842
at any level they go up to as long as the bodies are considering the law as it stands.

07:40:16.022 --> 07:40:17.844
So with KIPP, we support them.

07:40:17.924 --> 07:40:30.876
We want to make sure that this board understands that their petition is sound and that they are fiscally solvent and are ready to serve the communities as they have a deep track record of providing great service to communities.

07:40:31.236 --> 07:40:31.497
Thank you.

07:40:36.846 --> 07:40:42.331
Dear members of the board and staff, I'm Ana Maria Aristizabal, Director of Growth at KEP.

07:40:43.191 --> 07:40:56.122
When the Eastside Unified High School District denied our petition, we were dismayed to see that the district discarded years of collaboration and months of working together towards the opening of our high school in Eastside.

07:40:56.903 --> 07:41:06.591
While we were working on the charter petition with the district, we were negotiating a long-term facility to solve many of the issues that students here have complained about.

07:41:07.272 --> 07:41:14.678
Unfortunately though, the district made a long-term deal conditional to not opening our second high school and capping our growth.

07:41:15.538 --> 07:41:20.463
We want to move forward as partners of the district and remain committed to make it happen.

07:41:20.843 --> 07:41:22.044
Please approve our petition.

07:41:28.109 --> 07:41:30.350
I'm Kevin Murphy, parent and teacher on the east side.

07:41:30.950 --> 07:41:33.071
Charter schools claim to be public schools.

07:41:33.751 --> 07:41:38.433
They claim amazing feats, perhaps they play by different rules than true public schools.

07:41:39.093 --> 07:41:41.174
Perhaps KIPP is not truly a public school.

07:41:41.394 --> 07:41:45.596
Public schools would be supported predominantly by public funds, would you agree?

07:41:46.696 --> 07:41:58.411
A comprehensive annual financial report of KIPP area schools revealed that during 2015 and 2016 charitable contributions to their budget elipsed public funding.

07:41:59.812 --> 07:42:00.974
How is that a public school?

07:42:03.528 --> 07:42:14.153
In 2016 charitable contributions of $23 million comprised 36.53% of all revenues received by the network elipsing state aid.

07:42:14.253 --> 07:42:21.356
In 2015 contributions of $22 million elipsed the $17.2 million of state aid.

07:42:21.936 --> 07:42:26.338
Eastside Union High School District budget relies on over 80% of its funding from the state.

07:42:26.939 --> 07:42:29.100
Eastside Union High School District has public schools.

07:42:29.520 --> 07:42:31.761
KIPP is not but in name only.

07:42:32.501 --> 07:42:40.773
State Board of Education should support true public school students deny the KIPP petition honor the local public's decision.

07:42:45.836 --> 07:42:48.939
So we've heard talk today about how the law has to be followed.

07:42:49.519 --> 07:42:52.542
My name is Ona Keller.

07:42:52.662 --> 07:42:54.344
I'm with the California Teachers Association.

07:42:54.824 --> 07:42:57.187
So we've talked today about how the charter school act has to be followed.

07:42:57.207 --> 07:43:02.612
You know that the things that these students and parents are bringing up is really a question of policy and it's not a question for you.

07:43:03.472 --> 07:43:11.900
But I think you need to really see what your decisions are doing on the local level and the impact that you are having on all of our public schools.

07:43:11.980 --> 07:43:21.608
But if you don't care about that, if you don't care about the problems of co-location, if you don't care about the financial distress that you're putting these school districts under, then I'll give you some legal reasons to go ahead and deny this school.

07:43:22.049 --> 07:43:23.350
I'm going to pass this out.

07:43:27.264 --> 07:43:28.785
There's a number of reasons you could deny this school.

07:43:28.805 --> 07:43:41.191
You could deny it based on the fact that they don't serve EL and SPED students in the same proportion and that they're going to dramatically impact and increase the already wide gap between the types of students that are served in Eastside and in the existing KIPP schools.

07:43:42.031 --> 07:43:47.914
Or how about the fact that their governance is bereft of parental involvement.

07:43:47.934 --> 07:43:52.016
They are going to meet one time this year in San Jose during the school day.

07:43:52.097 --> 07:43:53.657
How is that allowing for parental involvement?

07:43:53.697 --> 07:43:55.198
How is that allowing for teacher involvement?

07:43:55.358 --> 07:43:56.579
It's an undemocratic system.

07:43:56.619 --> 07:43:56.919
Thank you.

07:44:00.157 --> 07:44:16.630
Okay, that concludes the public hearing and I'm going to ask our legal counsel Judy Sias on this to make some comments on the fiscal impact of argument that's been made by the opponents.

07:44:18.091 --> 07:44:19.732
Judy Sias, legal counsel for the board.

07:44:19.752 --> 07:44:25.116
I think would you like me to go over the reasons for denial again President Kirst and statute?

07:44:25.689 --> 07:44:26.750
Well, not all of them.

07:44:26.810 --> 07:44:31.915
I just want to go over the impact on the district, declining enrollment.

07:44:34.436 --> 07:44:44.219
Yes, as the superintendent stated earlier today, Eastside superintendent stated, the fiscal impact on the district is not a reason to deny a petition.

07:44:44.539 --> 07:44:49.241
You look at the petition and you analyze the petition based on the factors in law for the petition.

07:44:49.761 --> 07:44:58.583
Declining enrollment of the district, number of charters that already exist in the district, those are not reasons for denial of a charter petition.

07:44:58.603 --> 07:45:01.044
Okay, thank you.

07:45:01.284 --> 07:45:02.445
Wanted to get that on the record.

07:45:02.545 --> 07:45:03.385
Board member Rucker.

07:45:05.003 --> 07:45:07.064
Well, yeah, let me start with the charter liaison.

07:45:07.104 --> 07:45:07.445
Sorry.

07:45:07.485 --> 07:45:10.507
Yeah.

07:45:12.808 --> 07:45:29.960
First of all, I would like to thank very sincerely the superintendent of Eastside Unified that your explanation of the situation in your district was not only clear, but it was I think it was honest and candid.

07:45:31.801 --> 07:45:32.322
I really

07:45:33.374 --> 07:45:39.317
I'm sympathetic with the notion that the tipping point may have arrived and how that feels.

07:45:40.938 --> 07:45:59.567
And at the same time, while all this is going on, you have been working diligently to support not charters, but all kids, I think is probably your the best way of saying it in in your community, in your district.

07:45:59.627 --> 07:45:59.887
And so

07:46:02.472 --> 07:46:04.593
I have a great deal of respect for the work that you've been doing.

07:46:07.514 --> 07:46:09.215
Okay, Board Member Rucker, you're next.

07:46:12.776 --> 07:46:19.299
Well, first of all, I want to thank everyone who took the time and made the effort to come to today's meeting.

07:46:19.839 --> 07:46:29.423
And I have to say in the time that I have served on the board and in the time I've been monitoring the board before I came to serve as a member, this was a very unique hearing.

07:46:30.503 --> 07:46:50.995
You tend to expect, and I have expected that there would always be a great deal of passion on both sides of the conversation, both in support of a charter petition as well as in opposition to a charter petition, and districts have always argued about the fiscal impact or the concern about facilities.

07:46:51.475 --> 07:46:57.159
However, I'm confused about some information that just can't be correct.

07:46:57.879 --> 07:47:13.370
I heard, I think, and I read, I think, that the district had made a recommendation for approval, that the county had made a recommendation for approval, and for some reason it was denied so that they could appeal it to the board.

07:47:13.490 --> 07:47:27.379
I'm just, I got confused about that, and I was, and so if I've misstated that, I'm hoping I misstated that, because it just can't be accurate that somebody asked for the appeal, asked for the petition to be denied,

07:47:27.819 --> 07:47:31.843
so they could appeal it to the board knowing that they would be approved.

07:47:31.863 --> 07:47:34.085
So I got confused on, I'm not done.

07:47:34.726 --> 07:47:36.648
So I got confused on that.

07:47:37.836 --> 07:48:00.209
The second thing I'm confused on is I'm accustomed to hearing parents and students showing up in large numbers in support of choice and advocating for how the schools they are currently in have failed them and talking about how this creates a real option and a real promise for them that they do not currently have.

07:48:00.669 --> 07:48:04.132
This is the first time I've heard something exactly the opposite.

07:48:04.552 --> 07:48:16.122
Instead, I'm hearing large numbers of students saying that the charters create more problems than they solve, and while there's advocacy for choice, this is a choice they do not want.

07:48:16.782 --> 07:48:33.272
The other thing I'm hearing is that for all of the other schools that exist, there has been a very strong and very positive relationship between the district and the charter, and that the reality is the charters currently are under enrolled from what their enrollment numbers are.

07:48:33.652 --> 07:48:35.533
but we're going to add another charter.

07:48:35.954 --> 07:48:47.821
So while choice is very clear and very dynamic and very diverse in this district, there is some reason why the community at large seems to be rejecting this choice.

07:48:48.262 --> 07:49:03.572
So I'm confused because this is the first time I've ever seen a charter petition that contains all of these factors passionately supporting the idea of choice, the idea of access, the idea of balance,

07:49:03.852 --> 07:49:10.457
and a rich, high-quality curriculum, but it's in support of the existing school.

07:49:11.018 --> 07:49:15.241
The other issue that was brought up here was the concern about the co-location.

07:49:15.801 --> 07:49:27.931
And while the adults are having their conversation about money and fiscal constraints and declining enrollment, the students are talking about the decline in the quality of their educational experience.

07:49:28.351 --> 07:49:43.352
And we need to hear that, even if while we have made material revisions in charters, we have approved charters because we have stated that the district has not met their obligation to support those students.

07:49:43.912 --> 07:49:51.598
These students are saying the approval of this charter is not meeting the district's obligation to support them as well.

07:49:51.919 --> 07:50:00.586
So we have a clear conflict about the interest of students as a key stakeholder here, the interest of the district, and the interest of the charter.

07:50:01.326 --> 07:50:10.153
And the other thing that confused me is this is the first time I've actually heard Eric Premack give this board legal advice about how to interpret the law.

07:50:10.593 --> 07:50:17.758
This is the first time in a charter hearing I've actually heard anybody say, we have to follow exactly what the law says.

07:50:18.179 --> 07:50:22.882
So I'm just very, this is a unique hearing, and I'm actually happy.

07:50:23.723 --> 07:50:30.608
My grandparents, they are long gone, but they have said, if you live long enough, you'll see everything that can happen.

07:50:37.187 --> 07:50:40.373
Yeah, who's next?

07:50:42.217 --> 07:50:43.981
Felice Ortiz-Lacombe.

07:50:44.778 --> 07:50:47.340
Yes, and I believe the county was going to come forward.

07:50:48.280 --> 07:50:49.581
I also was a little confused.

07:50:49.641 --> 07:51:06.713
I understand that initially the recommendation from the school at the school level at the local school board was to approve and for no particular reason the board decided not to and then the second motion was not to approve but there was no real valid reason given.

07:51:07.193 --> 07:51:13.838
However, when it came to you, you also moved it forward with approval and the charter school petition

07:51:14.278 --> 07:51:16.139
that have been denied, and I want to know why.

07:51:16.439 --> 07:51:19.679
Why they rather you deny it so they could appeal to us.

07:51:20.040 --> 07:51:24.401
Because I think that's problematic if people feel like, just deny me so I could go to them.

07:51:25.281 --> 07:51:26.521
That's also something telling.

07:51:26.561 --> 07:51:28.222
So I want to know what the reasoning was.

07:51:28.262 --> 07:51:30.882
And I know that you'll probably provide it, but I also want to hear from the charter school.

07:51:31.723 --> 07:51:31.923
Yes.

07:51:34.912 --> 07:51:38.714
Yeah, the charter school, when we went over, our team had reviewed it and could find no findings.

07:51:38.794 --> 07:51:54.583
We did talk about an MOU and some of the conditions in the MOU, and the charter school, KIPP, did not like some of the areas that we had identified we were going to negotiate, and they wanted us to come to a conclusion by the 28th of November so they could meet the timelines here.

07:51:55.203 --> 07:51:57.124
We had to the 31st of January.

07:51:57.424 --> 07:52:00.965
And so they said if that could not be extended, they would like to come to the state.

07:52:01.385 --> 07:52:05.427
And so because they would not agree to the conditions in which we established, they requested to come to.

07:52:07.007 --> 07:52:07.788
Yes, you want to.

07:52:12.389 --> 07:52:14.890
Michelle Johnson for Santa Clara County Office of Education.

07:52:15.631 --> 07:52:25.934
When we brought our MOU to KIPP, we found they had 15 different areas that they wanted to go through the negotiation process.

07:52:27.995 --> 07:52:33.678
The originally KIPP Foundation was part of their petition saying that they are a sole statutory member.

07:52:34.699 --> 07:52:44.444
When we brought that we brought the MOU saying we want to make sure that all parties are part of this MOU because and they wanted to have KIPP Foundation removed.

07:52:45.024 --> 07:52:47.746
There was issues with regards to oversight.

07:52:48.786 --> 07:52:53.348
We require that because we authorized 23 different charter schools we

07:52:54.449 --> 07:53:00.152
require that we receive monthly reports from a financial standpoint so that we can monitor the fiscal.

07:53:01.293 --> 07:53:05.755
They didn't appreciate, they didn't agree with our monitoring pieces.

07:53:06.596 --> 07:53:08.577
There was issues with regards to the governance section.

07:53:09.457 --> 07:53:23.542
There was issues with regards to 1090, issues with regards to the conflict of interest, issues with regards to admission priorities, year-end closure and reporting requirements, audit language and identification issues.

07:53:24.862 --> 07:53:37.893
notification with regards to pending litigation, closure procedures with regards to their schools, term and renewal requirements, information with regards to additional sites, and revocation language.

07:53:38.253 --> 07:53:44.518
So there were multiple issues that were raised for us to negotiate through the MOU process.

07:53:47.745 --> 07:53:51.248
Can we hear from the charters and then from CDE?

07:53:51.769 --> 07:53:54.171
I would also like to hear how we resolve that.

07:53:55.732 --> 07:53:57.514
Let's hear from CDE first.

07:54:06.101 --> 07:54:12.046
That MOU that's being discussed would have been between the county and the charter school.

07:54:12.747 --> 07:54:16.830
So that wouldn't have been something that we would have been engaged in.

07:54:17.311 --> 07:54:23.756
If the school is approved, we then have our own MOU that would be between the state board and the charter school.

07:54:24.197 --> 07:54:25.958
So we wouldn't be engaged in that MOU.

07:54:29.636 --> 07:54:30.036
Go ahead.

07:54:30.837 --> 07:54:33.659
There's no standard MOU, is that correct?

07:54:33.900 --> 07:54:43.227
I mean for the CDE you have a basic MOU that you are consistent with with charters that you're in oversight of, correct?

07:54:43.508 --> 07:54:43.768
Correct.

07:54:44.068 --> 07:54:47.631
But there is no statewide standard for an MOU for a charter school.

07:54:47.651 --> 07:54:48.512
Not that I know of, no.

07:54:48.932 --> 07:55:04.644
And as a result, when a district comes into a situation of negotiating, we have no idea exactly how extensive that MOU was, how onerous it was to the charter school, or how lenient it was.

07:55:04.844 --> 07:55:05.565
We have no idea.

07:55:05.865 --> 07:55:11.829
Yeah, MOU is Memorandum of Understanding for students out there.

07:55:13.871 --> 07:55:18.054
I know that there were the Prop 39 facilities.

07:55:18.114 --> 07:55:20.075
That's why we had to hear this today.

07:55:20.176 --> 07:55:23.438
Was that mixed up in these timelines at all as your understanding?

07:55:24.058 --> 07:55:26.280
The need to qualify for those on time?

07:55:27.108 --> 07:55:40.533
that was there was a request for them to be heard today but the prop 39 piece is not something that we evaluated on behalf of the state board because that would then be negotiated between the Charter School and the school district.

07:55:41.333 --> 07:55:44.734
But there's a prop service yeah maybe you can answer that one too.

07:55:44.774 --> 07:55:56.638
Yeah the Charter School both KIPP schools believe that they needed to either get an approval today or they would not meet the deadline for the proper deadline I don't

07:55:58.117 --> 07:55:58.637
Party?

07:55:58.858 --> 07:55:59.738
The local.

07:55:59.798 --> 07:56:00.878
The local deadline.

07:56:01.939 --> 07:56:04.480
No, whether that's true or not, I don't know.

07:56:04.900 --> 07:56:10.762
However, that's a regulatory deadline under Prop 39, that's a regulatory deadline.

07:56:10.943 --> 07:56:13.404
State deadline, not a local deadline.

07:56:15.164 --> 07:56:16.385
Okay, state deadline.

07:56:17.762 --> 07:56:25.908
But I go back to the issue about whether the charter school said, look, just deny us and we'll go to the state board.

07:56:27.429 --> 07:56:30.372
There can be logical reasons for that in terms of timeline.

07:56:31.753 --> 07:56:32.093
Pardon me?

07:56:34.095 --> 07:56:34.575
I can't hear you.

07:56:36.867 --> 07:56:51.374
I don't know that they said that, but what I do know is that the district has indicated that the charter school did not want their original deadline for the MOU negotiations in January.

07:56:51.414 --> 07:56:58.878
They wanted it by the end of November, and when they couldn't reach that agreement of making the deadline sooner,

07:56:59.878 --> 07:57:07.180
the district has indicated that the charter school said we will just go to the state board.

07:57:07.601 --> 07:57:18.244
And one does have to realize that starting up a new school is a lengthy process and being approved in July is a difficult thing.

07:57:19.844 --> 07:57:24.726
Ortiz Lacone asked for the KIPP people to comment so I'd like to call them next.

07:57:36.713 --> 07:57:47.022
We very, very, very much wanted to be approved at the local level and we were deeply disappointed that we were not able to be approved at the local level.

07:57:47.542 --> 07:57:52.026
When we went to the county and my colleague was part of those conversations,

07:57:52.626 --> 07:58:05.675
It's my understanding that the county said we are changing our practice and charters will no longer have an opportunity to be in dialogue and discussion and negotiate an MOU.

07:58:05.775 --> 07:58:17.362
It will be part of the resolution and must be accepted wholesale, that that was a new practice and we wanted to have the opportunity to discuss some of these provisions.

07:58:23.673 --> 07:58:31.258
We understand that the county had struggled with other charters that were postponing the signature of the MOU for like months and even years.

07:58:31.658 --> 07:58:34.619
And of course, that's a situation that nobody wants to be in.

07:58:34.659 --> 07:58:38.922
So I understand they were trying to anticipate some of those discussions, so they wanted to bring it forward.

07:58:39.222 --> 07:58:48.847
However, I must notice that I only received the MOU because I asked for it one week before the vote, and we only got to see it three business days before the vote.

07:58:49.267 --> 07:59:00.196
So we came to that discussion very open and very transparent because the relationship with SCOI had been tremendous and had been so open and fluid that we were actually hopeful that we were going to be able to negotiate at that very table.

07:59:00.556 --> 07:59:05.160
Unfortunately, we were told that we should not engage lawyers, that we were going to deal with that afterwards.

07:59:05.540 --> 07:59:14.407
And only after we expressed our concerns and everything that we could not accept, unfortunately, they decided to put together a resolution by which we will be imposed

07:59:15.227 --> 07:59:16.808
all of the clauses that were included in there.

07:59:16.868 --> 07:59:31.157
So we were left with no options but to try to make a case the night of the appeals at the SCOE board meeting, and with the impression that we were not going to be able to reach a resolution that very night because our lawyers were not in agreement with their lawyers.

07:59:31.537 --> 07:59:41.101
It was clear that there was not going to be a path forward for us and certainly we needed to secure a Prop 39 facility for our school because we knew that there was not going to be another way for our school.

07:59:41.361 --> 07:59:44.322
So we needed to go for the timelines that would allow us to do that.

07:59:44.442 --> 07:59:52.365
So we proposed the county, why don't we come together and we reach an agreement on that MOU before the state deadline comes.

07:59:52.825 --> 08:00:01.276
And we were going to put hours and hours and hours into reaching an agreement, and they said that they could not agree to that, to a November 28th deadline.

08:00:01.496 --> 08:00:04.660
From November 1st to November 28th, they couldn't agree to.

08:00:04.760 --> 08:00:09.206
And that was the deadline so that we could submit our package by December 1st to this board.

08:00:14.011 --> 08:00:21.538
Actually, there was a motion from one of the members of the board at SCOE, if I remember well, Dr. DeSalvo, who actually passed the motion.

08:00:27.004 --> 08:00:28.425
We didn't ask them to deny.

08:00:28.445 --> 08:00:33.150
We say, if we cannot agree to the terms that you are proposing, we would prefer to be denied.

08:00:34.291 --> 08:00:36.673
But we asked them to approve our charter petition.

08:00:41.311 --> 08:00:45.506
Well, because we were not going to be able to accept the terms under which they were going to impose us.

08:00:50.287 --> 08:00:51.347
Yeah, okay.

08:00:51.848 --> 08:00:52.488
Trish Williams.

08:00:52.628 --> 08:01:13.077
Yes, I want to ask you to clarify, and the attorney that's standing behind you, the government code 1090 issue, both as it applies or doesn't apply to charter schools, and whether or not they were asking the district, the county were asking it to also apply to the foundation.

08:01:14.077 --> 08:01:16.618
and if that was one of the unacceptable conditions.

08:01:17.178 --> 08:01:39.225
And as well, I think it might have, I've been here a long time, so forgive me for a lapse of time here, but I think maybe it was the previous agenda item that, or it may have been you, that where the operator talked about all of the things that they do do for transparency and public transparency besides 1090.

08:01:40.985 --> 08:01:46.874
So if you could address that part of it, because I understand that was a big part of what we can't, we cannot agree to these terms.

08:01:47.555 --> 08:01:49.257
You need to explain 1090 and yeah, what is it?

08:01:52.773 --> 08:02:03.378
So, Government Code 1090 is a conflict of interest law that is specific to government agencies, whereas Kit Bay Area Schools is a non-profit public benefit organization.

08:02:03.898 --> 08:02:10.601
And as I mentioned earlier, we do adhere to the Brown Act, the Public Records Act, and the Political Reform Act.

08:02:11.241 --> 08:02:26.940
I also mentioned that we have a conflict of interest code that's approved by the Fair Political Practices Commission, the highest standard in the state, and our board and leadership annually submit the form 700, outlining economic disclosures in accordance with that policy.

08:02:28.602 --> 08:02:34.967
Adherence to Government Code 1090 could unnecessarily disrupt the governance and operations of a charter school.

08:02:35.548 --> 08:02:39.591
For example, charter schools cannot operate rent-free like school districts do.

08:02:40.232 --> 08:02:47.058
Under Government Code 1090, if any of our board members offered to provide a no-interest real estate loan to Kitt Bay Area schools,

08:02:47.638 --> 08:03:01.371
That board member could be subjected to criminal sanctions even if the board determined through its legally required conflict of interest policy that the loan was in the organization's best interest for its own benefit and fair and reasonable.

08:03:02.152 --> 08:03:10.339
This could make securing and paying for facilities much more difficult and force charter schools to divert resources away from educating children.

08:03:11.400 --> 08:03:16.182
Our board already complies with state and federal law regarding conflicts of interest.

08:03:16.683 --> 08:03:22.525
We are locally authorized by eight districts, none of which require us to comply with 1090.

08:03:23.266 --> 08:03:30.669
In 10 years of operation, we've never been suggested to be acting improperly in matters of financial or operational oversight.

08:03:31.149 --> 08:03:34.071
We agree to comply with all applicable laws.

08:03:35.273 --> 08:03:37.934
And can I ask them one more question since they're standing up there?

08:03:38.514 --> 08:03:46.036
The facilities issues have just grown more complex and more difficult for both charters and traditional public schools.

08:03:47.056 --> 08:03:53.878
I've been on the Eastside campus before a long time ago, and it was huge.

08:03:54.378 --> 08:03:56.479
It's a very large campus, yes.

08:03:58.280 --> 08:04:07.587
And where are, do you know where you would be expecting to get facilities, and do you know where the other charters are housed on the campus?

08:04:09.769 --> 08:04:14.053
The Independence High School campus is where our current high school is housed.

08:04:14.073 --> 08:04:21.639
The Prop 39 offer that we received, the preliminary offer for this proposed charter school, KIPP Navigate, is not on that campus.

08:04:22.420 --> 08:04:24.181
It's not on the Independence High School campus?

08:04:26.986 --> 08:04:44.012
Okay, so the concerns that we heard earlier about impacts on especially student access to fields and gyms and things like that, your location would not impact that at that school?

08:04:44.192 --> 08:04:49.453
According to the district's preliminary offer, that is not a consideration for placement.

08:04:49.734 --> 08:04:50.034
Okay.

08:04:51.694 --> 08:04:53.855
Okay, who's next?

08:04:56.380 --> 08:05:00.044
yeah well somebody will have to call on him Patricia so I didn't realize that part of

08:05:14.122 --> 08:05:33.207
Again, I want to make sure that I want to be corrected because I am confused about the MOU piece and whether it was negotiated or imposed by the district because I heard the presentation from the district and they suggested that they had enumerated a list of items that they wanted to have a, I'm sorry, the county, I can't.

08:05:33.507 --> 08:05:36.989
the county, that they wanted to have a conversation with you about.

08:05:37.029 --> 08:05:42.511
And as it's been stated, you know, LEAs can develop and craft their own MOUs.

08:05:42.891 --> 08:05:56.557
And what I just heard you say, based on what I just heard from my colleague who is the liaison to our ACCS who crafts our own MOU, you didn't like the MOU that the county was crafting,

08:05:57.017 --> 08:06:14.592
under their authority, so you're coming to the State Board because the State Board has a different MOU, which may be related to the reason why the suggestion was made that it would be better for you to deny the charter so that you could get the appeal to the State Board.

08:06:15.032 --> 08:06:22.338
But then, so, and again, if I'm wrong, please correct me, but then you also made a statement concerning Ed Code 1090,

08:06:24.580 --> 08:06:29.243
and whether or not your charter school is required to be compliant with that.

08:06:29.684 --> 08:06:33.566
And so I didn't know that that was part of the issue in the MOU.

08:06:33.986 --> 08:06:42.412
So there was, in June 2017, the Legislative Council sent a legal opinion to Assemblymember Reginald Jones.

08:06:42.852 --> 08:06:44.193
It was his request number 1713203.

08:06:45.114 --> 08:06:51.398
And they can, the Legislative Council concluded, it is our opinion that a charter school

08:06:52.078 --> 08:07:04.249
is subject to the conflict of interest provisions in the Political Reform Act of 1974 and Government Code Section 1090, and they did have a clear legal opinion that's been published.

08:07:04.509 --> 08:07:07.372
But what I just heard you say is you are not.

08:07:07.752 --> 08:07:08.893
So now who is correct?

08:07:09.033 --> 08:07:14.078
You, the charter school, or the legislative council advising the state of California?

08:07:17.026 --> 08:07:20.610
Yeah, let us get our legal counsel up here to talk about this.

08:07:20.751 --> 08:07:25.236
I'm not going to have I know this issues before the legislature as well.

08:07:25.396 --> 08:07:27.318
And the legislature has not acted.

08:07:27.659 --> 08:07:28.800
But there's no it is not.

08:07:29.280 --> 08:07:31.223
That's been published that says they are.

08:07:31.663 --> 08:07:32.825
So that's why I want to know.

08:07:33.045 --> 08:07:33.405
OK.

08:07:33.525 --> 08:07:33.846
All right.

08:07:33.906 --> 08:07:35.788
The legal counsel will answer the question.

08:07:36.985 --> 08:07:38.547
Legislative Council, Judy Sias.

08:07:39.167 --> 08:07:40.789
Yes, please speak into the microphone.

08:07:41.209 --> 08:07:42.890
Judy Sias with the State Board of Education.

08:07:43.491 --> 08:07:49.336
That is the Legislative Council opinion, but there is legislation and there are differing legal opinions out there as of now.

08:07:49.776 --> 08:07:54.240
There's legislation proposed that would clarify whether or not 1090 applies.

08:07:54.660 --> 08:07:56.081
That has not yet made it to the Governor.

08:07:56.101 --> 08:07:57.342
But that's not my question.

08:07:57.382 --> 08:08:01.906
My question is today, is the issue about what was contained in the MOU

08:08:02.967 --> 08:08:13.951
from the county the reason why the charter petitioners asked the county to deny them so they could come to the state board and not have to deal with 1090.

08:08:14.352 --> 08:08:17.133
I think that's the crux of my question.

08:08:17.973 --> 08:08:21.014
The State Board of Education's MOU does not require compliance with 1090.

08:08:21.294 --> 08:08:24.896
I heard them say, the charter, that there were several other reasons as well though.

08:08:25.336 --> 08:08:30.820
But, okay, and so our MOU does not require that.

08:08:31.340 --> 08:08:42.428
And one of the bones of contention between the charter, and again, because I didn't understand all of this as I read this information and heard the presentation, I'm

08:08:43.769 --> 08:08:48.293
mortified that I'm making some statements that are not accurate, but I am confused.

08:08:48.653 --> 08:08:57.621
So, the county office had an MOU that contained this requirement, which they have the legal authority to write, as I understand from Board Member Holliday.

08:08:58.301 --> 08:09:06.789
The charter petitioner didn't seem to like that, and they, in shopping around MOUs and comparing, we seem to have one that is

08:09:07.833 --> 08:09:15.997
I'm going to use the adjective easier because it doesn't contain some of the requirements that the county office wanted to include.

08:09:16.477 --> 08:09:22.400
And so they asked for a denial so that they could come and be approved here.

08:09:25.197 --> 08:09:29.201
They said there are many other reasons in addition to the 1090 that they had to negotiate.

08:09:29.742 --> 08:09:31.443
The timeline I can clarify.

08:09:32.144 --> 08:09:38.831
There are timelines on our website as to when we need to receive petitions in order to make a certain agenda.

08:09:41.454 --> 08:09:47.075
December, January, that we needed to receive the petition in order for it to make the March agenda.

08:09:47.495 --> 08:09:54.117
They wanted to, needed to make the March agenda, the charter school, in order to make the Prop 39 statutory deadline.

08:09:54.417 --> 08:09:57.057
So that's why they're saying there wasn't time to negotiate.

08:09:57.077 --> 08:09:57.497
Okay.

08:09:57.617 --> 08:10:00.198
This is a real abuse of this process.

08:10:00.258 --> 08:10:08.540
Regardless, the statute is real clear about what we can do, how we can handle an appeal, but this isn't a real abuse of this process.

08:10:08.580 --> 08:10:09.940
And I'm very concerned about that.

08:10:11.306 --> 08:10:13.927
Okay, Karen Valdez is next.

08:10:14.567 --> 08:10:21.089
I do want to give Superintendent Funk a chance to talk, but I don't want to, I don't want to confine it to this 1090 issue.

08:10:21.149 --> 08:10:23.270
So I will call on you.

08:10:23.590 --> 08:10:25.671
Let's, all right.

08:10:27.178 --> 08:10:40.545
Okay, so my question is just on the lottery system to get into the school as we're talking about this because that does impact the Prop 39 because it's going to be the students that reside within East Union High School District is how I understand it, correct?

08:10:40.925 --> 08:10:42.786
So has the lottery already been done?

08:10:43.387 --> 08:10:48.229
Are we assuming that the students from the middle school are matriculating to this new high school?

08:10:48.329 --> 08:10:51.971
I don't know what the admission component is in terms of the lottery.

08:10:52.552 --> 08:10:53.892
So if somebody could clarify that.

08:10:53.912 --> 08:10:54.733
You ought to answer that.

08:10:57.293 --> 08:11:01.124
CDE will answer that.

08:11:01.164 --> 08:11:02.407
They don't know, okay.

08:11:10.509 --> 08:11:12.711
Michelle Verrocki, founding school leader of KIPP Navigate.

08:11:13.512 --> 08:11:24.584
Our lottery is scheduled to run on Friday, the 16th of the month, and we do not have application requirements, so we're open to all of our students.

08:11:25.405 --> 08:11:30.431
The lottery, when it runs, it gives preference to students who are currently in our KIPP middle schools.

08:11:31.211 --> 08:11:39.577
And so as I shared before, we have 300 students who are in the three KIPP middle schools that are in the Eastside Union High School District.

08:11:39.797 --> 08:11:41.918
Sorry, it's not in the Eastside Union High School District.

08:11:41.958 --> 08:11:43.740
They're separate middle school districts.

08:11:44.280 --> 08:11:49.203
And so they would all come up into the Eastside Union High School District when they are entering high school.

08:11:49.844 --> 08:11:57.689
And so we give preference to our KIPP middle school students and then also then open up to all of the other students within the district.

08:12:00.746 --> 08:12:08.675
So to clarify, then, if you're matriculating all of your middle school into that high school, the high school enrollment you're starting with, could you repeat that number?

08:12:08.716 --> 08:12:10.878
What are you starting with year one in your high school?

08:12:11.539 --> 08:12:12.940
So we will be starting with 134.

08:12:13.001 --> 08:12:18.227
And so it sounds to me that all of those students will be KIPP students.

08:12:19.687 --> 08:12:25.991
Between KIPP San Jose Collegiate and KIPP Navigate, we aim to open to serve all of our students at our middle schools.

08:12:26.852 --> 08:12:31.535
And that would cap the enrollment for any other lottery potential?

08:12:32.156 --> 08:12:41.342
So because KIPP San Jose Collegiate is expanding to serve more students as well, we will have additional spots available for students within the district.

08:12:41.962 --> 08:12:45.645
But most of our enrollment will be from our KIPP middle schools.

08:12:47.133 --> 08:12:55.376
And then of the percentage of all of your middle schools, how many of those middle school students are residents of East Union High School District?

08:12:56.817 --> 08:13:04.560
Of the 300 KIPP middle school students, we anticipate about 90% of them will matriculate to a KIPP high school.

08:13:05.141 --> 08:13:10.463
And of those, the number that are within the district, I'm not too sure off the top of my head what that number is.

08:13:11.263 --> 08:13:11.863
Good, thank you.

08:13:12.384 --> 08:13:15.545
Yeah, it's board member Strauss.

08:13:15.888 --> 08:13:17.389
Before you leave, I do have a question.

08:13:17.470 --> 08:13:25.137
My understanding from some of the presentation, and then I want to talk to the superintendent, is that there are still vacant spaces in KIPP high school seats.

08:13:25.177 --> 08:13:34.025
How many open seats are not filled right now that have already been granted local charter authorization that the KIPP students could matriculate to?

08:13:36.007 --> 08:13:39.170
What vacant seats do you have now that are not full in high school?

08:13:39.970 --> 08:13:47.213
So at KIPP San Jose Collegiate, where I've worked the last four years, we've had the entire duration of my career there, a long wait list.

08:13:47.353 --> 08:13:53.516
And so we have full enrollment and we constantly have over 100 students on our wait list.

08:13:53.676 --> 08:14:08.702
And so by opening the second school, we'll be able to ensure that all of our KIPP middle school students have an aligned middle school to high school path, as well as being able to continue to offer a college preparatory education for students who may not have come to our middle schools

08:14:09.402 --> 08:14:10.063
that early on.

08:14:10.083 --> 08:14:16.388
Okay, but so do you, then are you saying that you currently have filled all your seats that you currently have in high school?

08:14:16.408 --> 08:14:18.549
Because that's not what we heard in some of the testimony.

08:14:20.271 --> 08:14:25.595
No, the charter high school, the charter school seats are full of all the ones that you've been granted, is that correct?

08:14:25.835 --> 08:14:26.856
Did I understand that correctly?

08:14:27.617 --> 08:14:30.820
So all of our seats are full and we do have a long wait list.

08:14:30.880 --> 08:14:45.793
I think one of the points that has been brought up is there are a few students within our high school that are outside the bounds of the district and that is because families have had to relocate but they continue to stay with our program until the students continue into college.

08:14:46.093 --> 08:14:47.054
Okay, thank you.

08:14:47.414 --> 08:14:53.079
I just want to mention, I don't know of any legal requirement that they have to be students within the district.

08:14:53.479 --> 08:14:53.900
I wasn't asking.

08:14:53.920 --> 08:14:55.221
I thought that was the whole idea.

08:14:55.241 --> 08:14:56.642
I was just asking for vacancies.

08:14:56.682 --> 08:14:57.323
I don't know what this is.

08:14:57.363 --> 08:15:03.068
No, no, I thought there was, my question was, are your high schools fully enrolled, the KIPP high schools right now?

08:15:03.148 --> 08:15:04.389
And what I heard you say is yes.

08:15:04.410 --> 08:15:04.570
Yes.

08:15:04.630 --> 08:15:05.450
And we have a long waiting list.

08:15:05.491 --> 08:15:06.672
That's, that was my clarifying.

08:15:07.613 --> 08:15:09.054
Yeah, that's my clarifying question.

08:15:09.074 --> 08:15:10.315
Okay, so I, is that okay?

08:15:10.355 --> 08:15:17.302
I do want to ask the Prop 39 question for the superintendent and ask you for Eastside Union High School District Superintendent if, just a question,

08:15:18.183 --> 08:15:28.005
Just a compliment to you and your staff, of all the charters we've heard and charter appeals, I have not heard a more collaborative or cooperative district process.

08:15:29.398 --> 08:15:34.721
in sharing space, in making five-year commitments to space, and local granting.

08:15:34.801 --> 08:15:46.068
So in your effort with KIPP and all the charters that you authorized appears to this point to have been cooperative and collaborative in process, and things changed at this point, which was different.

08:15:46.188 --> 08:15:57.876
So, and I just as a, before you comment, I just was thinking having run a large high school and managing fields, and I can't imagine 16 soccer teams, let alone all the number of basketball teams,

08:15:58.496 --> 08:16:08.241
understanding how challenging it is for athletics, it seems like you're trying hard to maximize the use and cooperate within the intent of Prop 39.

08:16:08.361 --> 08:16:15.405
I'm just interested in sort of how things switched and what's happened that's so different from past authorizations.

08:16:15.465 --> 08:16:26.190
Yeah, you can answer that, but there are other questions you might want to respond to, so I don't want to just restrict you to that because there was a lot of issues brought up that you may want to respond to.

08:16:26.550 --> 08:16:28.031
But you can start with that one and

08:16:28.988 --> 08:16:32.331
Go where you want from the superintendent Eastside Union High School District.

08:16:32.451 --> 08:16:33.452
Thank you for the compliment.

08:16:33.513 --> 08:16:34.674
Appreciate it.

08:16:35.695 --> 08:16:49.649
I believe we are the poster child district for collaboration with our charters and a reminder that it was a 45 year lease to have Kip build their new high school on our district office property that they backed out of.

08:16:50.841 --> 08:16:54.802
But I wanted to clarify the point that was made earlier.

08:16:55.563 --> 08:17:02.885
The reason why we have students and so many from Independence is because we have three charters on the Independence campus.

08:17:03.345 --> 08:17:09.467
And they were speaking passionately about the impact of charters and sharing space on the Independence campus.

08:17:10.107 --> 08:17:18.250
Now, full transparency, for KIPP East San Jose, we made our primary initial offer at Oak Grove High School.

08:17:19.793 --> 08:17:25.495
What the CEO did not tell you is they denied that request and requested Independence High School.

08:17:26.555 --> 08:17:30.717
So it would be a fourth charter on Independence High School.

08:17:30.817 --> 08:17:37.720
So I just want people to be transparent when they speak to you, because that's not being very transparent.

08:17:39.860 --> 08:17:41.301
Are there other questions that you like?

08:17:41.401 --> 08:17:43.162
Because the 1090 is not an issue.

08:17:43.382 --> 08:17:44.302
That was a county issue.

08:17:49.837 --> 08:17:54.481
Okay, if that's, we want to have KIPP respond to that then.

08:17:58.745 --> 08:18:08.894
Our initial request was to put the new KIPP high school on the Independence campus because ACE was moving somewhere else and there would be portables available and that would allow for more collaboration.

08:18:08.914 --> 08:18:15.040
As those issues continued to rise, we saw that those portables would be removed and that was an unlikely spot.

08:18:15.740 --> 08:18:19.545
And so when we got our initial proposal, we were placed on Oak Grove High School.

08:18:19.925 --> 08:18:25.932
And if you look at the boundaries of the East San Jose High School District, it's a very large school district.

08:18:26.433 --> 08:18:30.218
And Oak Grove is located in the very south part of that district.

08:18:30.958 --> 08:18:43.227
Currently, we have of our 300 KIPP middle school students, only two students who live in the zip code of where Oak Grove High School is because the Eastside Union High School District encompasses many zip codes.

08:18:43.887 --> 08:18:50.151
So we did indeed deny to be at Oak Grove High School because it's just too far from our families.

08:18:50.652 --> 08:18:59.358
If you look at the traffic and the way our families would have to commute, they would have to spend so many hours in the car trying to get their students to school.

08:19:00.038 --> 08:19:10.145
And many of the students are also enrolled in other middle and elementary schools depending on the size of our families and where their children are in the progression to their schools.

08:19:10.626 --> 08:19:24.835
So we have requested to be placed on another one of the comprehensive high schools within the district, but we have requested to be at one of the six comprehensive high schools that are in between KIPP Heartwood, KIPP Heritage, and KIPP Prize.

08:19:25.576 --> 08:19:27.978
And so there are other options that are

08:19:28.658 --> 08:19:29.939
are not Independence High School.

08:19:29.999 --> 08:19:54.097
We recognize that Independence High School does have three campuses, and there are other high schools that do not have a charter or that only have one at this time, and so our intent is to try to relieve the issues that have been brought up by Independence, because as members of the KIPP community, we feel those same struggles, and we also have a lot of students who are in sports and in clubs, and we wanna build comprehensive schools,

08:19:54.617 --> 08:20:13.050
to ensure that all of our students have that opportunity and we recognize the hardships it causes when we need to share and when students have really long days as a result and so our goal is to try to find a compromise and try to make it work with the district and we've also gone to great lengths to try to find a long-term home for KIPP.

08:20:13.491 --> 08:20:17.073
We really want to be able to provide our own facilities so we're not

08:20:18.554 --> 08:20:40.336
like always located within the campuses of the current high schools and so when we think about the facility request that went to the district to be built on the district land the reason why that fell through at the last moment is because we need additional time to work out one of the different proposals around the VTA agreement because the students would have to cross over VTA land.

08:20:40.896 --> 08:20:48.044
And we didn't have enough time with the timeline that the district gave us to be able to work out that final agreement, and thus the school fell through.

08:20:48.565 --> 08:21:00.178
And so had they granted us two-week extension in which we had asked for, we would be able to build that school for Kip San Jose Collegiate, and we would be able to remove our students from the Independence campus.

08:21:00.558 --> 08:21:10.162
And that is our ultimate goal, is to be able to not be encroaching on the independence campus or additional schools, but to be able to build our own comprehensive high school.

08:21:10.522 --> 08:21:16.244
We're able to provide those funds, we're able to build the school, we're looking for land to be able to do that.

08:21:17.745 --> 08:21:22.930
Given the approval, we would be able to continue those efforts in finding land to build schools.

08:21:23.330 --> 08:21:26.954
But in the meantime, as we are growing, that is our first.

08:21:27.834 --> 08:21:32.639
We need to rely on the Prop 39 process to have a facility in that time being.

08:21:34.858 --> 08:21:36.820
Okay, Board Member Holliday.

08:21:36.880 --> 08:21:45.788
So we don't know for a fact what all went on over the past long series of negotiations.

08:21:46.028 --> 08:21:55.016
We don't know exactly what intent any one individual had during these weeks and months and I guess years involved in all this.

08:21:55.669 --> 08:22:05.027
But what we do know is that we have two KIPP middle schools with families who care that their middle school students matriculate.

08:22:06.017 --> 08:22:12.179
into a KIPP high school and that this is a viable alternative for them.

08:22:12.339 --> 08:22:18.841
We know KIPP's reputation as a solid charter organization.

08:22:19.581 --> 08:22:29.164
We just approved another KIPP school five hours ago, and I believe that this is a valid petition.

08:22:31.365 --> 08:22:42.073
that all of this discussion about MOUs and all of that is really not in our purview to pull apart.

08:22:42.393 --> 08:22:48.277
And instead, I think that this is a charter school that needs to be approved and I will so move.

08:22:48.297 --> 08:22:49.438
Is there a second?

08:22:49.458 --> 08:22:50.739
I'll second.

08:22:50.759 --> 08:22:51.239
Moved and seconded.

08:22:51.259 --> 08:22:51.659
I'll second.

08:22:52.200 --> 08:22:53.281
Further board discussion?

08:22:55.762 --> 08:22:59.385
Okay, all those in favor, raise your hands.

08:23:01.741 --> 08:23:02.061
Okay.

08:23:02.222 --> 08:23:03.183
Any abstentions?

08:23:06.187 --> 08:23:06.948
One vote no.

08:23:09.110 --> 08:23:09.771
One no vote.

08:23:11.033 --> 08:23:11.353
All right.

08:23:11.413 --> 08:23:13.236
Well, the board will recess till tomorrow.
