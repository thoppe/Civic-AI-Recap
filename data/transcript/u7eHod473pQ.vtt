WEBVTT

00:10.809 --> 00:19.196
We are convening for the May 9th session and I'm going to begin when everyone is quiet.

00:21.357 --> 00:22.318
Thank you very much.

00:23.999 --> 00:27.582
I'm going to begin with announcing the results of closed session.

00:27.622 --> 00:34.988
In closed session the board discussed on the following case, Thrive Public Schools versus SBE.

00:36.551 --> 00:39.913
We're going to move on to regular consent items.

00:41.194 --> 00:45.217
And there are two separate consent votes since we have multiple recusals for item 14.

00:45.297 --> 00:49.960
So we're going to start with items 5 through 13.

00:51.541 --> 00:56.585
And do we have any public comment on items 5 through 13?

00:58.328 --> 01:06.430
Yes, we have one person signed up for item six, Angela Doramos, and one signed up for item 12, Rick Loya.

01:06.811 --> 01:09.271
OK, shall we have public comment?

01:20.575 --> 01:21.015
Good morning.

01:24.595 --> 01:25.055
We did.

01:25.155 --> 01:31.802
Former mayor of Huntington Park where yes I had to chair over meetings where we had 20 and 30 people come and yell at us.

01:32.502 --> 01:34.284
One time we even had 75.

01:34.965 --> 01:38.969
But for what you folks dealt with yesterday it just shows

01:39.569 --> 01:54.806
the system works and I just wanted to congratulate you for letting everyone speak, everybody got their two cents in, some may not be happy with the results but the process did work and as a former health teacher I'm just delighted now this

01:55.447 --> 02:05.356
The thing can go along and the framework can come out and someday there'll be a health education requirement somewhere where that framework will really nail things down.

02:05.437 --> 02:13.124
So you did a fantastic job, especially the chair who times up, times up, and that was super.

02:13.444 --> 02:14.245
Congratulations.

02:29.580 --> 02:30.400
Angela Doramos.

02:36.622 --> 02:38.222
Are there public comments?

02:38.343 --> 02:42.544
I think we are, unless there's any other discussion, we are ready to vote.

02:43.444 --> 02:44.304
Can I have a motion?

02:45.505 --> 02:46.825
I'm asking for a motion.

02:47.645 --> 02:48.305
I move approval.

02:48.926 --> 02:49.366
Thank you.

02:50.446 --> 02:51.266
Second, thank you.

02:52.407 --> 02:53.287
All in favor, say aye.

02:54.147 --> 02:54.207
Aye.

02:54.227 --> 02:54.987
Any opposed, nay.

02:55.587 --> 02:56.368
Any abstentions?

02:57.088 --> 02:57.288
Okay.

03:07.621 --> 03:10.983
All right, we're losing our several folks.

03:14.887 --> 03:16.428
Now this is item 14.

03:19.671 --> 03:22.933
And is there any public comment on this item?

03:26.356 --> 03:26.556
Item 14.

03:28.464 --> 03:32.008
All right, with no public comment, any discussion?

03:32.028 --> 03:35.211
I need a motion to approve.

03:36.692 --> 03:37.754
Thank you, and a second?

03:37.774 --> 03:38.694
I'll second.

03:39.215 --> 03:40.016
Thank you very much.

03:40.877 --> 03:41.738
All in favor, say aye.

03:41.758 --> 03:41.818
Aye.

03:42.699 --> 03:43.319
Any opposed?

03:44.380 --> 03:45.261
Any abstentions?

03:46.743 --> 03:49.886
All right, so moved.

04:02.712 --> 04:20.218
All right, so I'm told I have to bang the hearing when we start a public hearing, the gavel.

04:21.259 --> 04:23.120
Okay, public hearing commences.

04:23.440 --> 04:24.180
No, we don't have to.

04:25.481 --> 04:26.481
Oh, after your presentation.

04:26.541 --> 04:27.641
OK, thank you.

04:28.742 --> 04:30.042
Get to bang it more than once.

04:30.102 --> 04:30.682
That's great.

04:30.762 --> 04:30.962
Yeah.

04:31.682 --> 04:32.502
Thank you very much.

04:34.183 --> 04:35.323
It's the most fun part.

04:35.543 --> 04:40.124
All right.

04:40.164 --> 04:42.744
Good morning, President Darlingham and board members.

04:42.764 --> 04:43.944
My name is Lisa Constancio.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.705
I'm the director of the Charter Schools Division.

04:46.165 --> 04:54.106
And I'm here to present item number 15, Eagle Collegiate Academy that has an appeal before the state board for an establishment of a charter school.

04:56.357 --> 05:00.621
Ed Code section 47605 defines what is before us.

05:00.701 --> 05:09.030
Basically, it is the education code that states how we look at establishments and new petitions for establishment of a charter school.

05:09.610 --> 05:17.158
It states that the governing board of a school district, and in this case, the state board, shall not deny a petition unless it makes written findings.

05:17.298 --> 05:19.941
And it needs to make at least one of the following written findings.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.243
Our charter school presents an unsound educational program.

05:23.623 --> 05:28.507
The petitioners are demonstratively unlikely to successfully implement the program.

05:29.168 --> 05:32.190
The petition does not contain the required number of signatures.

05:32.730 --> 05:35.853
The petition does not contain an affirmation of specified assurances.

05:36.453 --> 05:42.077
And the petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 required elements of the charter.

05:42.097 --> 05:48.142
I just wanted to lay this out in the beginning so we can reference back to it if we need to as we go through the presentation.

05:50.168 --> 06:02.499
The Department of Education recommendation is the State Board hold a public hearing to deny the request to establish Eagle Collegiate Academy, a kindergarten through 12th grade charter school under the oversight of the State Board.

06:03.099 --> 06:12.168
The recommendation is based on the following findings, that they are demonstratively unlikely to successfully implement the program based on an unrealistic financial and operational plan,

06:13.089 --> 06:24.152
This includes aggressive enrollment projections and an unviable facility plan and also that one of the current the charter elements is is Not fully fleshed out and that is the one for employee qualifications

06:27.390 --> 06:36.095
Timeline here, on November 8th, 2018, the Actin-Aguadulce Unified School District voted to deny the Eagle Collegiate Academy petition by a vote of three to zero.

06:36.795 --> 06:49.202
On December 18th, 2018, the Los Angeles County Board of Education voted not to take action on the petition by a vote of six to one, and I'll talk a little bit more about that later in the presentation.

06:50.002 --> 06:53.564
The petitioners submitted a petition on appeal to the state board on July 29th of 2019.

06:57.284 --> 07:00.106
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools met on April 10, 2019.

07:01.246 --> 07:05.829
The Advisory Commission moved staff recommendation to deny the petition to the State Board of Education.

07:06.389 --> 07:09.411
The motion passed by a vote of 5 to 2 with one abstention.

07:12.472 --> 07:18.518
Past history, the Eagle Collegiate Academy has made multiple attempts to become locally authorized.

07:18.918 --> 07:28.907
The petition was submitted to two different school districts, Sulphur Springs, which denied them in 2016, and then Actin Aguadulce Unified denied the petition twice, in 2017 and then in 2018.

07:31.430 --> 07:37.918
Each of the times they went before the district, they also then subsequently went before the County Office of Education in Los Angeles.

07:38.579 --> 07:44.547
So in December 2017 and then July of 2018, LACO denied the petition both of those times.

07:44.787 --> 07:47.311
On the third time, the most recent one in December,

07:47.891 --> 07:49.392
they voted to take no action.

07:49.512 --> 07:50.813
And they voted to take no action.

07:50.853 --> 08:03.759
The staff report stated that the current petition contained few changes from the previous ones that they had seen, which is why at that point they decided to take no action on the petition and then subsequently were able to appeal then to the State Board.

08:06.482 --> 08:25.995
Just a quick summary of the district and county findings, inadequate description of educational program, insufficient description of performance goals, insufficient description of key staff positions, lacked assurance of ADA accessibility, detailed safety policy and procedures, and then unclear admission criteria related to the international baccalaureate program.

08:28.615 --> 08:43.091
The petitioner did state that each time the petition has gone through, has been up, they have gone through multiple revisions in response to the feedback they've received from the district and county and have made adjustments in areas of finance, the educational program, and their charter elements.

08:46.424 --> 08:58.806
The school proposes to open this fall in 1920, serving kindergarten through eighth grade initially with 355 students, including 15 pupils in pre-K for three and four-year-olds.

08:59.367 --> 09:11.529
They are proposing to grow to serve 555 pupils in kindergarten through grade 12 by 2023-24, and they do intend to locate in the boundaries of the Actin-Aguadulce Unified School District.

09:13.715 --> 09:23.364
The mission of Eagle Collegiate is to empower pupils to become self-confident, egalitarian, and authentic global citizens preparing for the 21st century careers and responsibilities.

09:23.984 --> 09:34.234
They plan to become an IB school and outline the IB continuum implementation timeline for primary years, middle years, diploma program that is aligned with the common core standards.

09:36.880 --> 09:41.802
In terms of our findings, the findings are in inability to implement the program.

09:42.062 --> 09:46.084
The school is fiscally viable based on the budget they have submitted to us.

09:46.705 --> 09:49.606
They have positive ending fund balances and reserves.

09:50.787 --> 09:52.708
Our concern is to be fiscally viable.

09:52.748 --> 09:58.090
The budget plan requires that they meet this enrollment projection of 355 students in their first year of operation.

10:02.948 --> 10:05.613
We are concerned about this aggressive enrollment projection.

10:05.653 --> 10:10.921
They are proposing to open with 355 students in TK through grade 8 in the first year.

10:12.194 --> 10:16.916
They do then plan to add high school one year after that in each subsequent year.

10:16.977 --> 10:28.282
So they plan to add grade nine through grade 12, one grade per year over the next four years of the charter term, and proposing to go from 355 students to 555 students within that five-year window, which is a 63% increase over that five years.

10:34.125 --> 10:42.031
while also implementing this international baccalaureate program, which can be complex and does require a lot of teacher professional development.

10:42.932 --> 10:48.716
The petitioner has stated that they have received 400 meaningful intent to enroll forms from parents.

10:52.143 --> 10:58.464
The aggressive enrollment projections are also compounded by the size of the school district in which the petitioner is proposing to locate.

10:59.104 --> 11:01.165
Actin-Aguadulce is a small school district.

11:01.185 --> 11:08.046
They serve approximately a little over 1,000 pupils, comprised of one elementary school, one middle, and one high school.

11:08.706 --> 11:12.827
Their average enrollment by grade of each of these is between 50 and 100 pupils.

11:13.267 --> 11:18.688
The majority of the enrollment at this school district is for non-classroom-based charter schools.

11:21.863 --> 11:26.886
In terms of the facility, we do have some concerns here as well in terms of their ability to implement.

11:27.346 --> 11:32.489
The petitioner is currently in negotiations to lease the property in the boundaries of Acton Agua Dulce.

11:33.510 --> 11:40.754
At the April 2019 Advisory Commission meeting, they stated that in its current state, the property has the capacity for four classrooms.

11:41.555 --> 11:48.759
But in order to accommodate 355 pupils, they'll need to add at minimum at least an additional 13 portables by August of 2019.

11:51.092 --> 12:02.456
So they have budgeted $275,000 in tenant improvements and in modular costs for July of this year and an additional amount for July of 2021.

12:02.496 --> 12:12.540
And they did state at the Advisory Commission meeting also that they had not considered the following costs, which was additional portables needed for the first year of operation,

12:13.280 --> 12:25.912
expansion and renovation costs, time and cost to obtain applicable permits, and then time and cost to renovate to meet the building code standards for e-occupancy, which is required for a state board authorized school.

12:26.232 --> 12:31.677
So the petitioner has submitted some subsequent information that I'm sure she'll be speaking to when she comes up.

12:32.277 --> 12:35.399
We are still very concerned about the time it will take to do this.

12:35.679 --> 12:46.625
And even, pardon me, with just the e-occupancy alone, there is renovation involved in the current building that involves firewalls and things that do take time and do take additional costs.

12:46.725 --> 12:49.527
So we are concerned about that all being done by August 2019.

12:52.726 --> 13:09.577
Also in terms of deficiencies in the charter elements, there is a deficiency in employee qualifications in terms of the petition identifying what's key in each category and specifically the additional qualifications expected of individuals assigned to these positions.

13:10.078 --> 13:22.126
So with the complexities of implementing an IB program for TK through grade 8 in the first year, this element is of particular importance in implementing the educational program and the essential staff that's needed to be identified.

13:22.926 --> 13:35.255
Professional development, as I mentioned, of an IB teacher is extensive, so the section does talk about personal professional development, but it doesn't speak to the significant amount needed for teachers to implement this type of program.

13:37.600 --> 13:53.126
In summary, CDE staff is recommending denial due to the written finding would be inability to implement the program based on an unrealistic operational plan, aggressive enrollment and facility concerns, and the clarification of the charter element in the petition would be needed.

13:54.727 --> 13:56.107
So that's the end of my presentation.

13:56.127 --> 13:58.408
Are there any questions I can answer at this time?

14:01.569 --> 14:02.510
Yes, sir.

14:07.528 --> 14:07.988
Thanks, Lisa.

14:08.068 --> 14:11.669
I appreciate your always thorough review of your findings.

14:11.709 --> 14:13.870
Just a couple of technical questions, I think.

14:14.790 --> 14:19.411
One, you mentioned on the findings page about inability to implement the program.

14:20.231 --> 14:21.771
And I just want to make sure I understand this.

14:21.831 --> 14:31.114
The majority of the enrollment in Acton, Agua Dulce, in the school district, is that of the 1,080 students?

14:31.174 --> 14:33.154
The majority of that is non-classroom based?

14:33.514 --> 14:36.315
No, I should clarify, I'm sorry I didn't clarify that.

14:36.555 --> 14:39.516
The 1,080 students is within the district.

14:39.936 --> 14:44.977
They have, if you look them up in the directory there's about 15,000 students in the district.

14:45.337 --> 14:49.698
The majority, the remainder of those are what is the non-classroom based enrollment.

14:49.798 --> 14:50.658
Okay, but not the 1,080.

14:50.898 --> 14:52.499
Correct.

14:52.759 --> 14:53.539
From charter schools?

14:53.739 --> 14:53.939
Yes.

14:55.420 --> 14:58.400
Can you, because they have many charters.

14:59.161 --> 15:00.161
Is that homeschooling?

15:00.181 --> 15:00.801
What does that mean?

15:05.788 --> 15:10.349
OK, within the district, classroom-based charter schools.

15:11.269 --> 15:11.709
I'm sorry.

15:12.189 --> 15:17.330
Within the district, classroom-based schools, the enrollment in those three schools, the elementary, the middle, and the high school is the 1,080.

15:18.911 --> 15:24.732
If you pull up the district in the directory, I think the enrollment is over 14,000, almost 15,000.

15:24.912 --> 15:32.794
The difference there between that and the 1,080 are non-classroom-based charter schools that have been authorized by the district.

15:34.229 --> 15:36.551
They have many charters at this district.

15:36.591 --> 15:40.314
They're all operating non-classified.

15:42.536 --> 15:43.777
Is that virtual?

15:43.877 --> 15:46.419
What does it mean to be non-classroom based charters?

15:46.539 --> 15:48.781
It's primarily, yeah, go ahead.

15:49.662 --> 15:51.283
It is primarily resource centers.

15:51.523 --> 15:58.409
So there are resource centers that students can come in for one-on-one independent study type programs with a teacher.

15:59.769 --> 16:19.277
I have a list, I'll go back and take a look at my list of all the schools that, I pulled up the district so I'd have that with me, but they could be homeschool programs as part of the independent study as well, but it looks like the majority are resource centers that are located, authorized by the district, can be located within those district boundaries.

16:21.186 --> 16:32.211
just a couple, one more, on the facility, because as you appropriately noted, the bulk of the conversation at ACCS had to do with availability of facilities.

16:33.011 --> 16:41.015
So I just want to clarify that in order to accommodate the 355 pupils, there need to be an additional 13.

16:41.815 --> 16:45.997
And I just, then the next one, your next slide says that they've budgeted 275.

16:47.978 --> 16:53.741
in tenant improvement and modular costs for July 19 and 275 for July.

16:53.781 --> 16:56.662
Would that cover the additional 13 portables or not?

16:57.663 --> 17:03.505
If they're going to lease the portables, I think they can accommodate leasing the portables with a portion of that.

17:03.866 --> 17:14.831
The part that's unsure is the renovation costs because there could be I don't know until our facility people get out there if there are ADA issues that will need to be addressed.

17:15.471 --> 17:26.579
Just for, I can tell you from my old facility days, just certification of occupancy for the E, they have to build firewalls in order to meet that building standard.

17:27.020 --> 17:29.201
There are additional costs for that as well.

17:29.261 --> 17:33.124
And this is all outside of the permitting, because there's permitting for zoning.

17:33.164 --> 17:34.145
Right now it's a church.

17:34.625 --> 17:43.452
So to change the conditional use permit, that isn't as big of a deal to do, but it is to make it an E occupancy building,

17:43.852 --> 17:46.293
There are renovation costs that are going to be involved in that.

17:46.553 --> 17:52.135
And I don't know the extent of those without taking a look at the building itself.

17:52.775 --> 17:55.696
And I'm not sure if they know to that extent yet either.

17:55.716 --> 17:55.756
OK.

17:56.937 --> 18:04.339
There are clarifying questions right now.

18:04.560 --> 18:05.260
We'll get those.

18:05.700 --> 18:06.880
Then we'll get the public hearing.

18:06.900 --> 18:08.421
Yes, Matt.

18:11.371 --> 18:20.881
In relationship to the facility costs and the expectations, I'm clear in my understanding that they want this to happen in two months, August.

18:21.141 --> 18:21.362
Yes.

18:26.747 --> 18:27.288
Any questions?

18:27.308 --> 18:27.448
Yeah.

18:30.067 --> 18:34.890
My question was on the statement you made concerning the personnel.

18:35.530 --> 18:41.774
Is the personnel you're speaking about the actual classroom teachers, or is it other personnel that's the issue?

18:41.994 --> 18:42.655
The teachers.

18:42.995 --> 18:44.136
Okay.

18:44.356 --> 18:47.778
I'll ask for other details later, but I wanted to make sure I understood what you were asking.

18:47.798 --> 18:47.958
Okay.

18:51.760 --> 18:53.021
Now I do the gavel.

18:53.962 --> 18:56.063
Now I convene the public hearing.

19:01.078 --> 19:04.619
If there is public comment, do we have a?

19:04.779 --> 19:06.479
Petitioners have time, okay.

19:07.660 --> 19:13.621
The petitioner will have 10 minutes and then we will hear from the district and the county if they're here.

19:13.641 --> 19:14.501
I'm not sure if they're here.

19:15.041 --> 19:17.122
They together have 10 minutes as well.

19:17.782 --> 19:21.403
Then we'll hear general public comment which will be one minute and then we'll close the public hearing.

19:38.356 --> 19:39.618
That's not your presentation.

19:39.938 --> 19:41.420
That's all right.

19:41.461 --> 19:44.825
Okay, so we have... That's that.

19:44.865 --> 19:46.287
This one here?

19:47.870 --> 19:50.714
Ah, got it.

20:28.343 --> 20:35.245
Good morning, honorable Madam President, Dr. Darlene Harmon, and honorable board members.

20:36.846 --> 20:44.608
On behalf of our team, families, and community who are anxiously waiting for your decision, thank you

20:45.472 --> 20:50.334
for taking the time to review our petition and to hear our appeal today.

20:50.594 --> 20:52.695
And thank you also to the CDE staff.

20:52.955 --> 20:55.296
We know it was a lot of work to read.

20:56.156 --> 20:58.037
My name is Ogokoye Johnson.

20:58.377 --> 21:01.938
I am the board secretary and founder of Eagle Collegiate Academy.

21:02.418 --> 21:07.380
I am here with Dr. John White, who is our CEO and veteran administrator.

21:08.021 --> 21:14.163
We will start our presentation by sharing with you a two minutes quick video showcasing our lead teachers and families.

21:16.516 --> 21:22.959
Honorable Commissioners and Board Members, I am Eliana Howe, Family Teacher and ELD Coordinator for ECA.

21:23.299 --> 21:29.101
I have attended several district and county board meetings to advocate for this wonderful school.

21:29.642 --> 21:31.142
Please approve our school.

21:31.222 --> 21:31.622
Thank you.

21:31.702 --> 21:35.944
My name is John Sokeke, Special Education Director for Eau Claire Jeter Academy.

21:36.664 --> 21:40.426
Many parents of students with learning differences have shown interest in this school.

21:40.606 --> 21:42.767
Honorable Board Members, please approve this school.

21:44.557 --> 21:53.218
Honorable Commissioners and Board Members, I'm Elizabeth Chislett, the Art Teacher and IB Coordinator for Eagle Collegiate Academy.

21:53.699 --> 21:59.700
On behalf of our teachers, students, and community, please approve our phenomenal school.

21:59.820 --> 22:00.760
Thank you so much.

22:01.460 --> 22:13.702
Honorable Commissioners and Board Members, I am here for the Korean families in Antelope Valley, Santa Clarita Valley,

22:14.457 --> 22:21.221
and San Fernando Valley, who have been waiting for Eagle College Academy to open.

22:22.042 --> 22:30.267
It is an excellent educational program, and the location is perfect and ideal for our families.

22:31.868 --> 22:36.351
Please approve Eagle College Academy for our families.

22:36.931 --> 22:37.332
Thank you.

22:39.173 --> 22:42.175
We are the Michaels, and we support ECA!

22:44.977 --> 22:54.546
Don't stop this unique opportunity for all children and families.

22:54.606 --> 22:56.328
Hi, my name is Edwin Resinos.

22:56.448 --> 22:58.610
I am the pastor of City on a Hill Church.

22:58.830 --> 23:07.698
I am here with Dr. Ogo, and this is our congregation who are asking you to please approve Eagle Religion Academy.

23:08.019 --> 23:08.860
And the people said,

23:14.599 --> 23:15.201
I do it.

23:15.222 --> 23:16.406
I do it.

23:16.707 --> 23:18.835
Thank you and I'm glad you do it.

23:26.209 --> 23:34.891
I also want to draw attention to the letter that Senator Scott Wilk, the vice chair of the Education Senate Committee here, wrote.

23:35.212 --> 23:36.452
This was handed out to you.

23:36.532 --> 23:40.973
I just want to point attention to that so that you are aware that he wrote this letter.

23:40.993 --> 23:48.215
I also want to state just quickly that during the second time we were at LACO, it was a no action.

23:48.375 --> 23:50.436
There was a vote of three to two.

23:50.536 --> 23:54.477
And so LACO actually did not take action during that time.

23:55.237 --> 24:10.369
The foundation of ECEA is influenced by the tapestry of grit that defines my life experiences to overcome against all odds as an immigrant raised by a single father who taught me to work hard after the death of my mother.

24:10.929 --> 24:25.664
my passion for equity and social justice, and to eliminate all gaps, achievement, opportunity, and graduation, so that zip code and economic status will not hinder any child from receiving a quality education.

24:26.244 --> 24:40.235
Our locally grown, locally owned, and locally operated resilient team of passionate professionals, parents, and educators are very humbled by our 407 families overwhelming confidence in us.

24:41.096 --> 24:43.898
So we answer their mandate for education choice.

24:44.358 --> 24:50.163
We know that hundreds of families have sent you emails and have called on behalf of ECEA.

24:50.383 --> 24:52.564
So that is why we are here today.

24:53.565 --> 25:03.192
In researching the best instructional model that will meet the needs expressed by our families, we chose a career-to-career model that answers these four basic questions.

25:03.893 --> 25:06.415
For what future are we preparing our students?

25:06.935 --> 25:10.818
What skills and attributes will students need to be successful in this future?

25:11.399 --> 25:14.981
What will schools do to prepare students in this future?

25:15.482 --> 25:18.144
How can schools, families, and communities work together?

25:18.704 --> 25:35.132
And hence our mission, Eagle Collegiate Academy will empower students to become self-confident, independent-minded, egalitarian, authentic, lifelong learners and global citizens that are prepared for 21st century careers and responsibilities.

25:35.512 --> 25:40.755
And in order to accomplish that, our mission, we have to use these following best practices in front of you.

25:41.627 --> 25:50.034
Our chosen facility is zoned C3, and it does not need a conditional use permit.

25:50.834 --> 26:00.962
And in order to turn it to a school, we submitted a zoning verification letter and a chart from the LA County Department of Regional Planning to you.

26:01.562 --> 26:05.465
We also submitted a letter from the lead engineer to you.

26:06.326 --> 26:13.290
The portable and modular classrooms that come ready with e-occupancy do not need anything done to it.

26:13.650 --> 26:16.831
It will be leased, and the lease is within our budget.

26:17.352 --> 26:21.774
We are confident we will be ready to open by September 30th at the latest.

26:22.514 --> 26:25.636
So here are the letters that we sent you just as a reminder.

26:26.817 --> 26:32.359
In our response to CDE staff report, we did submit the 80% budget.

26:34.123 --> 26:37.511
And we appreciate staff for making the correction that we submitted.

26:38.493 --> 26:40.979
And they found both our budgets to be viable.

26:42.148 --> 26:50.851
Here is a sample of the Charter Asset Sample Proposal showing that we have the cash needed to open.

26:51.531 --> 27:01.094
Although we lost the public charter school grants of up to $475,000 because we were not approved by March 14, 2019, we will reapply for it.

27:01.714 --> 27:11.077
We have applied for other grants, including $35,000 for Brett Mayer grant with skilled grant writers, and we will keep applying for grants that we are eligible for.

27:13.058 --> 27:21.182
Our enrollment growth is not to cover expenditures, but to meet the instructional program that we want, pre-K through 12th grade school.

27:22.003 --> 27:29.507
The proposed location is reasonably priced facility at the border of Algodolce and Kenyon country.

27:30.107 --> 27:36.931
Acton-Algodolce Unified School District happens to be the only K through 12 school within our community.

27:39.512 --> 27:42.414
Most interested families are from Santa Clarita.

27:44.488 --> 27:54.754
Although not required, due to families' continued interest, we were able to collect 159 signatures between April 1 and April 7 to demonstrate interest.

27:55.574 --> 27:57.976
We are confident that we will meet our enrollment.

27:59.077 --> 28:04.740
A breakdown of the number of applicants per grade level based on parent interest is demonstrated below.

28:07.938 --> 28:18.456
ECA has the staff and teachers in place, such as the experienced CEO, school administrative assistant, in addition to already highly qualified teachers.

28:19.389 --> 28:27.271
In the summer of 2018, we posted positions and we received 540 applications in the summer of 2018.

28:27.431 --> 28:30.872
And we were able to hire staff ready to begin.

28:30.892 --> 28:41.014
ECA team has deep knowledge of IB, professional development, and we will work closely with the IB to make sure that teachers and school leaders are trained.

28:41.454 --> 28:48.216
Mr. Phil Evans was here and he fielded many questions during the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools meeting in April.

28:49.935 --> 28:56.621
Element five, we didn't use the word key, but we met all the other legal requirements and affirmations.

28:57.502 --> 29:02.906
And we identified key positions and we put down the specific qualifications for them.

29:03.367 --> 29:08.511
So ECA will continue to make all the revisions to the charter petition that CDE requires.

29:09.512 --> 29:11.913
So why do we need ECA?

29:12.673 --> 29:17.875
It will be the first and only pre-K through 12 IB wall school in Santa Clarita.

29:18.616 --> 29:20.937
It will support parents with before and after school.

29:21.937 --> 29:33.282
It will eliminate huge gaps in the CASP scores that is found in the transitional grades such as 3 and 7 in all really our local schools in the area.

29:33.982 --> 29:44.594
It will provide more access to rigorous college prep classes, and it will definitely eliminate or lower the chronic absenteeism that is very rampant in our area.

29:44.734 --> 29:48.719
So rampant that it's higher than the county and the state averages.

29:50.618 --> 29:52.959
Here are the chronic absenteeism rates.

29:53.279 --> 29:54.720
For the county, you can see that.

29:54.740 --> 29:56.441
You can see the demographics over here.

29:56.841 --> 30:03.765
And you can see that the rates for the districts are higher than that of the state and county.

30:04.725 --> 30:13.570
When you drill it down to the subgroups, you can see even more dire results in terms of chronic absenteeism in this area.

30:14.610 --> 30:19.253
So here is our credit to career vertical articulation structure.

30:20.273 --> 30:25.695
And as you can see, we have lower school, middle school, upper school, and we have career electives that we offer.

30:27.176 --> 30:35.679
And the relevant research that we have paid attention to, there are a few of them, are here, and you can see who created those research.

30:36.080 --> 30:49.205
And so, we are ready to open, and we ask you to please listen to the voice of the parents who have been working hard to bring this to the community and approve our petition, thank you.

30:50.461 --> 30:52.742
And we are here if you have any questions for us.

31:03.525 --> 31:06.886
So we'll have the county office.

31:07.706 --> 31:07.966
Thank you.

31:20.595 --> 31:21.316
Good morning board.

31:21.336 --> 31:26.539
Thank you for having us here today We are here.

31:27.119 --> 31:28.540
My name is Nishay Patterson.

31:28.760 --> 31:49.454
I am the current director of charters for Acton Agua Dulce Unified School District And I just want to give you a little background on what our team does We are comprised of myself who is the director of charter schools We have assistant superintendent of business services Lynn David and the superintendent Larry King.

31:49.534 --> 31:50.335
We are the ones that make

31:51.216 --> 31:57.921
recommendations to the board on any petitions, renewals, anything that has to do with the charter.

31:57.941 --> 32:03.166
So we make the recommendations to the board and we report on various charter matters.

32:03.806 --> 32:09.971
Our recommendations to the board trustees are based on a matrix that's used as a tool to analyze and evaluate our charter petitions.

32:10.892 --> 32:19.805
The petitions that comply with the law and demonstrate a sound, unique instructional program and present a viable fiscal plan may be recommended for approval to our board.

32:20.326 --> 32:26.836
Eagle Collision Academy's petition was denied due to the petitioner's failure to meet those guidelines.

32:27.977 --> 32:45.297
The basis to deny the Eagle Collegiate Academy charter petition is based on findings that the petitioners are demonstrably Unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition and the petition fails to include reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all of the 15 elements identified in the ed code 47 605 B 5 and

32:48.767 --> 32:55.849
The petition presents an unrealistic financial and operational plan and an unrealistic plan for the proposed educational program.

32:56.509 --> 33:03.031
The proposed financial and operational plan is unreasonable because it contains expenditures that appear to be unreasonably low.

33:03.611 --> 33:08.772
It relies on aggressive initial enrollment and aggressive growth to cover its projected expenditures.

33:09.512 --> 33:19.384
As mentioned before, our enrollment, our seat-based programs, are approximately 1,080 students that we have in the Acton-Aguadulce area.

33:20.365 --> 33:22.388
We are on declining enrollment.

33:22.428 --> 33:26.012
We have approximately 400 students enrolled.

33:28.291 --> 33:29.772
maximum at each site.

33:29.872 --> 33:32.353
We have one elementary, one middle, one high school.

33:32.733 --> 33:35.934
We have 376 students at our elementary school.

33:36.394 --> 33:38.275
We have 360 in our middle school.

33:38.435 --> 33:40.256
And we have 371 in our high school.

33:40.816 --> 33:42.416
So we have very low numbers.

33:42.497 --> 33:46.638
So the projected number of being able to start a program with 355 students

33:49.219 --> 33:50.860
It's extremely high.

33:51.841 --> 34:05.869
It relies on borrowing based on that ADA to manage cash for three years and projects a reserve that will not meet requirements in the first year of enrollment, does not materialize for startup costs to prove to be under budgeted.

34:07.388 --> 34:33.491
The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to success I'm sorry successfully implement the program set forth in the petition because they present an unrealistic educational plan The petitioners proposed to implement an international baccalaureate IB program But the petition does not demonstrate enough familiarity with the program with the IB program and although they had a person come up from the IB Program itself the

34:35.524 --> 35:01.170
Experience that their teachers would need and based on what they projected as a starting pay rate for teachers doesn't really line up with Beginning pay for teachers that have that type of experience that would be implementing an IB program The petition does not contain enough detail about IB program implementation to give staff confidence that the petitioners be successful

35:02.330 --> 35:15.056
In addition, we found deficiencies in their educational program, their measurable student outcomes, employee qualifications, health and safety, and admissions requirements.

35:17.977 --> 35:18.657
Any questions?

35:18.677 --> 35:22.979
Is the county here?

35:25.881 --> 35:27.361
Oh, the county, yeah, they are here.

35:59.725 --> 36:01.667
Thank you, President Hammond and board members.

36:02.187 --> 36:03.788
My name is Indra Lopez-Ciccarelli.

36:04.429 --> 36:08.812
I am the director for the charter school office at the Los Angeles County Office of Education, or LACO.

36:09.733 --> 36:16.598
Eagle Collegiate Academy, or ECA, has made four unsuccessful attempts to obtain a district-level charter, as noted on the screen.

36:17.539 --> 36:23.643
ECA also submitted three appeals to the Los Angeles County Board of Education, following denial by each district.

36:24.604 --> 36:27.106
The county board denied the first petition by a vote of 5 to 0.

36:28.527 --> 36:33.930
The county board took no action on the second appeal with a split vote of three to two in favor of denial.

36:35.031 --> 36:43.115
On this third appeal, the county board voted six in favor and one in opposition to specifically take no action with regards to this third submission to the county.

36:44.076 --> 36:55.983
LACO staff did review this latest petition, but as the county board did not take action on this latest position, staff is here today to share the findings of the Los Angeles County Review Team rather than any findings made by the board.

36:58.445 --> 37:09.695
County staff found only minor revisions between the three submissions and determined that all three petitions failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success and failed to provide a comprehensive description of the required elements.

37:12.597 --> 37:13.358
Based on the review,

37:15.512 --> 37:27.493
and the analysis of the petition, supporting documentation and the information gathered at the capacity interview, it is the county staff's determination that the petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the proposed educational program.

37:28.482 --> 37:36.166
The law identifies four indicators to determine if the petitioners are not able to successfully implement the instructional design stated in the petitions.

37:36.986 --> 37:42.769
The review team considered the evidence and found that three out of the four indicators are present, as listed on the screen.

37:43.849 --> 37:50.532
First, the petitioner is unfamiliar with the content of the petition or the requirements of law that would apply to the proposed charter.

37:51.113 --> 37:51.653
For example,

37:52.333 --> 37:58.939
The petitioners are unfamiliar with the requirements of law regarding services for EL students and regarding suspensions and expulsions.

38:00.000 --> 38:04.904
Second, the petitioners lack the necessary background critical to the charter school's success.

38:05.545 --> 38:14.273
For example, while the school intends to base its entire program around the International Baccalaureate or IB framework, none of the site team members has direct experience with IB.

38:15.874 --> 38:21.936
Third, the petitioners have presented an unrealistic financial and operational plan for the proposed charter school.

38:22.716 --> 38:33.980
For example, the school intends to begin operation this coming school year with an overly aggressive enrollment plan that represents 30% of the district's entire population spread across 10 grade levels.

38:34.640 --> 38:39.422
Furthermore, the identified location does not have proper zoning or a certificate of occupancy.

38:41.471 --> 38:44.754
Some specific deficiencies within finding five are as follows.

38:45.475 --> 38:52.061
The proposed educational program lacks an adequate description of an instructional program for English learners and students with disabilities.

38:52.862 --> 39:06.775
The petition lacks required metrics within the eight state priorities for their measurable pupil outcomes as required under LCFF regulation such as a goal for English learner access to English language development standards and an English learner reclassification rate.

39:07.836 --> 39:14.242
Furthermore, the petition fails to provide differentiated outcomes for student subgroups as required by LCFF.

39:15.563 --> 39:25.653
Element 10 includes lists of non-discretionary, suspendable, and expellable offenses that fail to include offenses mandated by law, such as brandishing a knife and sexual assault.

39:26.914 --> 39:34.019
The elements identified as not reasonably comprehensive are critical and directly impact the school's ability to implement a sound educational program.

39:34.700 --> 39:40.443
Changes to these elements would require significant material changes to the petition which are outside the scope of an appeal.

39:41.824 --> 39:51.351
In summary, the Los Angeles County staff found that the petition failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success and failed to provide a comprehensive description of the required elements.

39:51.911 --> 39:53.372
We're happy to answer any of your questions.

39:55.930 --> 40:00.411
Okay, I think at this point we want to go to public comment, if there is any.

40:02.171 --> 40:05.032
Yes, would the following speakers please line up at the podium?

40:05.752 --> 40:17.075
Angela Deramos, Debu Rodriguez, Ogo Johnson, Ayifani Ezruran, John White, Janelle Rooley, Dr. Ago Idowu.

40:18.530 --> 40:27.660
We'll just remind folks that public comment is limited to one minute per speaker and there'll be a little light that comes on as well as a reminder when you reach that point in time.

40:28.200 --> 40:30.163
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

40:30.243 --> 40:30.523
Thank you.

40:34.209 --> 40:38.151
Hello I'm Sheila Whitley and I'm speaking for California Teachers Association.

40:39.031 --> 40:48.995
CTA is strongly opposed to overturning the decisions of the local school district that are well reasoned and best understand the needs of the students in the local area.

40:49.915 --> 41:05.544
CTA is also opposed to authorizer shopping in which a charter school submits virtually the same petition to multiple school boards or submits the same petition repeatedly to the same district hoping for a different result.

41:07.485 --> 41:10.426
ECA is an egregious example of this behavior.

41:10.947 --> 41:16.830
If the State Board of Education were to approve this charter petition it would be endorsing this troubling practice.

41:18.536 --> 41:25.841
ECA has presented a deficient charter school petition with an unrealistic recruitment plan, budget, and educational program.

41:26.422 --> 41:30.605
It has been rejected by multiple school districts and the county board numerous times.

41:31.125 --> 41:42.414
The state board should support the practice of local control wherein districts develop priorities and plans with input from all stakeholders, including parents, students, teachers, and community members.

41:43.014 --> 41:45.996
In conclusion, this appeal should be denied.

41:46.076 --> 41:46.397
Time.

41:46.417 --> 41:46.897
Thank you.

41:52.799 --> 41:53.259
Good morning.

41:53.319 --> 41:56.440
I'm Debbie Rodriguez in support of Eagle Collegiate Academy.

41:57.561 --> 42:03.763
Of Acton-Aquadulce district schools that they charter, 11 are virtual schools.

42:04.284 --> 42:05.584
One is independent study.

42:06.204 --> 42:08.025
Two are primarily classroom.

42:08.125 --> 42:10.706
However, one of those is adult education.

42:11.487 --> 42:22.231
One and only one school that they charter is site-based, offering high school students a high school diploma program specializing in academic credit recovery.

42:22.691 --> 42:29.454
So basically the main choices for our children is traditional district boundary schools or virtual.

42:31.423 --> 42:40.946
EGLE's unique academic program is like nothing offered in Acton-Acuadulce community or the Antelope Valley and Santa Clarita Valley communities.

42:41.946 --> 42:47.468
This is why EGLE's support continues to be so strong and continues to grow.

42:48.208 --> 42:56.271
Families in the Santa Clarita Valley, Antelope Valley, Castaic, Fraser Park, Fillmore, and San Fernando Valley are waiting to thank you.

43:10.506 --> 43:11.026
Good morning.

43:12.388 --> 43:14.590
I'm Dr. Ayodeji Idu.

43:15.550 --> 43:18.453
I am a parent and resident of Kanye country.

43:19.254 --> 43:26.380
I know that there are many families like me that are eagerly waiting for Igu College Academy to open.

43:27.320 --> 43:38.190
The parents like the fact that IB requires that school leaders and teachers are trained so they know for sure that their children are being taught by trained teachers.

43:38.730 --> 43:40.551
It's been a long journey to get here.

43:41.251 --> 43:47.913
I've been to the site, and I've seen Dr. Johnson make numerous connections with the engineers.

43:48.473 --> 43:56.396
And also, the last time we were here, there is a gentleman from IB from New York that answers all the questions.

43:56.836 --> 44:02.597
So we appreciate and urge the board to approve Eagle Collegiate Academy.

44:03.818 --> 44:04.138
Thank you.

44:15.057 --> 44:26.801
I am Ifanyi Zuku, my five-year-old daughter, and my two little twins, boys, are very desirous to attend Eagle College Academy.

44:27.781 --> 44:31.642
We all reside in Santa Clarita, and that's why I am here today.

44:32.102 --> 44:34.563
However, I want to call your attention to

44:35.343 --> 44:44.646
silent points that the Honorable Senator representing our district, the 21st District of the State Senate, sent to you.

44:45.467 --> 44:53.570
I know you all have it, but please give me a few seconds to highlight certain areas that will make you approve the college.

44:54.750 --> 44:55.771
He's in support of it.

44:56.631 --> 45:03.775
As a state senator representing Santa Clarita Valley and surrounding communities, where students will be attending ECA reside.

45:04.355 --> 45:08.277
I'm actually aware of the scarcity of education choice for our residents.

45:09.138 --> 45:13.600
The city of Santa Clarita does not have any classroom-based charter for its residents.

45:15.981 --> 45:16.942
It appears- Time.

45:17.022 --> 45:21.164
Concerns of the CED- Time.

45:25.211 --> 45:25.542
time.

45:38.001 --> 45:45.867
I'm Elizabeth Chislett and I'm the IB coordinator and art teacher for Eagle Collegiate Academy.

45:46.687 --> 45:58.416
I've been to IB informational sessions and webinars and I'm looking forward to getting the IB training for Eagle Collegiate Academy.

45:58.496 --> 45:58.896
Thank you.

46:05.151 --> 46:07.492
Good morning, Board President Darling-Hammond, board members.

46:07.552 --> 46:08.673
My name is Janelle Rooley.

46:08.753 --> 46:11.135
I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Young, Mini, and Core.

46:11.435 --> 46:15.637
We're here today in support of Eagle Collegiate Academy and seeking your yes vote today.

46:16.438 --> 46:24.462
What you're hearing today is the sort of apex of families who are desperate for change in this particular area, for change and for choice in this area.

46:25.463 --> 46:27.144
Families are willing to drive.

46:27.204 --> 46:28.605
This is not a dense urban area.

46:29.025 --> 46:37.611
Families are willing to drive in order to find a classroom-based charter school option that serves their students in the way that they're looking for, a K-12 SPAN school.

46:38.952 --> 46:49.140
The location in Acton, the reason that the petitioners keep going back to Acton is because that's where the facility is, and charter law says that we have to petition the district where we're going to be located.

46:49.520 --> 46:51.041
And so that's why they keep going back there.

46:51.481 --> 46:56.384
In addition, it's also convenient for all of the families, or as convenient as possible for them to get there.

46:56.784 --> 46:59.486
So the enrollment will come from outside of the district.

47:00.206 --> 47:04.848
The concern that the budget relies on enrollment, I mean, I think that's true for every school, right?

47:04.869 --> 47:06.950
The enrollment has to do with the budget.

47:08.651 --> 47:09.271
Thank you very much.

47:16.682 --> 47:21.326
I will close the public hearing and we'll begin discussion.

47:21.366 --> 47:22.507
I'd like to ask Sue Burr.

47:26.810 --> 47:31.154
We may come back to some of the previous speakers for questions as needed.

47:32.507 --> 47:44.836
So maybe I would ask Lisa to come back up because I think that, as I mentioned in my clarifying questions, the bulk of the conversation at ACCS was about the issue of facilities.

47:45.356 --> 47:51.241
And at least as I review the materials that came to us after the meeting, I'm not sure that it's resolved.

47:52.242 --> 47:55.085
And so I'd like you to talk a little bit about your assessment of that.

47:55.826 --> 48:03.975
And also especially about the use permit needing to be an E permit, because I know we have new members and I'm not sure that they know of that requirement.

48:04.015 --> 48:06.358
So if you could just clarify that, I'd appreciate it.

48:06.498 --> 48:06.658
Yes.

48:07.980 --> 48:15.484
So our concerns are, I did go through everything that they submitted to us in terms of the leasing of the portables, which I think is reasonable.

48:15.504 --> 48:20.828
Our concerns still lie in, they're going into an existing church building.

48:20.988 --> 48:24.290
So in that church building, they think they can do four classrooms.

48:25.470 --> 48:26.591
which is probably fine.

48:26.671 --> 48:29.213
However, we don't know the accessibility.

48:29.253 --> 48:33.956
If there's any accessibility issues at this church, that's one issue that I'm concerned about.

48:34.556 --> 48:47.544
Also, even if it is zoned for school purposes, let's just say, there's a difference between the zoning and then what the building code standards then are.

48:48.104 --> 48:57.349
So whether it's zoned appropriate for educational purposes, the permitting piece, the building code piece, it has to be an e-occupancy.

48:57.489 --> 49:07.654
And so in order to be an e-occupancy and to meet those building code standards, there will be renovations within that building that will need to be made to be e-occupancy.

49:07.995 --> 49:12.297
And that is a requirement of our MOU, of the state board's MOU with the charter schools.

49:12.697 --> 49:14.518
and that does need to happen prior to opening.

49:14.899 --> 49:28.888
So that, in essence, until our facilities folks can get in there, if this petition is approved, to see what's even involved, I don't see how that can get done within the next two to three months for this school to be able to open.

49:29.209 --> 49:30.830
So we are really concerned about that.

49:31.270 --> 49:35.293
Then if it doesn't open, then we're in a different situation.

49:37.470 --> 49:54.652
So I would just say the majority of the folks on the ACCS, many of whom have had personal experience with this kind of activity of getting modulars in place and we're very skeptical that this could happen by the proposed opening date.

49:55.472 --> 50:02.015
And I agree, I think, with what the department has said for sure about the aggressive enrollment projections.

50:03.015 --> 50:21.443
To have 355 kids there in August, and there seems to be a little bit of a time discrepancy between when they would actually, even if they were able to dot all the I's and cross all the T's, get all the modulars in place, that couldn't happen until the end of September at the earliest is what I heard.

50:22.564 --> 50:29.011
So, I'm happy to listen to other comments or I can make a motion now, but I don't know if other people have questions or comments.

50:32.014 --> 50:32.434
I'm sorry.

50:33.536 --> 50:37.400
Felisa, and then I see Ting, and then I'll come back to Patricia.

50:40.256 --> 50:40.636
Thank you.

50:40.656 --> 50:50.324
I think that if this was based on aspirational and a model that you would aspire to, this is definitely something that seems like a great option for students.

50:50.905 --> 50:54.448
However, I'm very concerned about the feasibility of it.

50:54.848 --> 51:07.319
And in particular, when it comes to enrollment, because we have 400 interested individuals, but we're also looking to open K-8, which is a huge grade span.

51:07.959 --> 51:10.961
And so from these 400, and also the facilities.

51:11.002 --> 51:14.204
So the facilities issues, I did my little time with facilities.

51:14.644 --> 51:17.887
It's not only, we always find something as you're in that process.

51:18.587 --> 51:20.008
And then try to remove a portable.

51:20.108 --> 51:22.230
You will be surprised how expensive that is.

51:22.310 --> 51:24.692
It's more expensive than putting the portable on the site.

51:24.792 --> 51:30.956
Removing it actually is a lot more costly, and if you're leasing land from somebody, you wouldn't have the choice.

51:30.976 --> 51:32.477
You would have to remove the portables.

51:33.498 --> 51:37.101
Unlike what we did at schools, we just left them there, because it was just too expensive to actually

51:39.641 --> 51:45.903
So with the 400 interests, do we have a sense of the breakdown?

51:45.963 --> 51:52.684
So out of those 400, how many are interested in kinder, first, second, where are they coming from?

51:53.084 --> 51:57.125
Because to populate a school K-8, we're not growing the school.

51:57.205 --> 52:01.586
We're assuming that we'll have enough students for nine grades.

52:02.386 --> 52:03.466
I just don't see that realistic.

52:04.161 --> 52:05.462
I'll have the petitioner speak to that.

52:05.502 --> 52:08.123
We just know how many they had, but I don't know the breakdown.

52:08.143 --> 52:08.904
Okay, thank you.

52:10.225 --> 52:14.007
Is it possible to bring up the PowerPoint because it was in the presentation?

52:37.358 --> 52:41.362
I wanted to take you straight to the presentation so that you can visually see that as well.

52:55.754 --> 52:57.795
So this is the breakdown that we submitted.

52:58.396 --> 53:00.677
We had, oh, I'm sorry.

53:01.738 --> 53:02.138
I'm sorry.

53:02.198 --> 53:10.183
So this is in the presentation that we turned into you from the 417 parents that were interested, because some of them have multiple children.

53:10.984 --> 53:13.666
And so this is what the breakdown we have.

53:13.686 --> 53:14.706
So for pre-K, we had 73.

53:14.746 --> 53:15.367
For TK, we had 12.

53:15.607 --> 53:16.408
For K, we had 88.

53:18.709 --> 53:22.632
For grade 1, we have 58, grade 2, 48, grade 3, 57, grade 4, 54, grade 5, 34, grade 6, 49, grade 7, 51, and grade 8, 36.

53:37.625 --> 53:41.047
So you would start with about four kinder classes.

53:41.107 --> 53:42.828
Walk me through how you would open your school.

53:42.848 --> 53:44.909
These are the people who are showing interest.

53:44.949 --> 53:53.373
But based on what we try, that's why we know we're confident that we're going to have to do a lottery, because we are only going to have 355 students.

53:53.433 --> 53:57.415
And what we put in our petition is that we're going to have 20 to 1.

53:57.775 --> 54:06.099
So we're only going to have two of each class, except for eighth grade, which would be just one classroom, one grade.

54:06.872 --> 54:09.934
And you're also starting the IB program wall to wall.

54:09.994 --> 54:15.717
So every single one of your grades would be your teachers go through the IB program, correct?

54:15.977 --> 54:16.397
Yes, ma'am.

54:17.137 --> 54:22.800
So I'm not sure if maybe the staff could tell us more about the person from IB.

54:22.860 --> 54:24.241
I think his name is Philip Evans.

54:24.761 --> 54:31.945
The letter that I read here is not really a letter of support, but rather a letter that describes the process to become IB.

54:32.385 --> 54:34.367
So when this person came, was he

54:35.447 --> 54:40.349
in support and saying they're ready to implement this model, or is it more about the model?

54:40.429 --> 54:41.629
Because I think there's a difference.

54:41.669 --> 54:53.873
He went into detail about how the model is rolled out and how they partner, but there was really nothing in the letter that said, I believe that EGLE Collegiate is ready and positioned to implement.

54:54.369 --> 55:23.322
and he stated that when he was here the letter was more to help because unfortunately he couldn't make it today he really wanted to be and based on the questions that he was asked he wanted to make it clear that it is not necessary for IB teachers to be trained to implement IB PYP and IB MYP before starting and so he wanted to explain what the protocol was so that you guys will understand it and so in order to

55:24.022 --> 55:34.091
do a wall-to-wall PYP and NYP, you're pretty much using your curriculum with their, you know, strategies, and they help you and train you throughout the process.

55:34.131 --> 55:37.374
And that's what he wanted to explain, so that it's step-by-step.

55:37.394 --> 55:45.582
Because it seemed to him, as he was listening, that that, you know, from the questions he was receiving, it wasn't clear what that meant.

55:46.182 --> 55:50.366
Even though all those things are also in the petition, and we can go into the petition and see that.

55:51.529 --> 55:56.532
I just want to say I think this is super ambitious.

55:56.772 --> 55:58.593
I want to buy into it.

55:58.653 --> 56:04.836
I've just seen both on the facility side, on the enrollment side, and I've also had experience enrolling out IB.

56:05.416 --> 56:09.138
And to do it all concurrently just seems very ambitious to me.

56:09.218 --> 56:09.638
But thank you.

56:10.465 --> 56:12.286
Okay, thank you.

56:13.026 --> 56:23.711
And I also just, for the petitioners, I appreciate your vision for the program and it sounds like there is a need for something different in that particular area.

56:24.871 --> 56:36.456
But I'd also agree with member Ortiz-Lacombe that it is extremely ambitious and to start TK through eighth grade, wall to wall,

56:37.536 --> 56:49.861
and to have fidelity and integrity to that model instead of growing it slowly so that you can really make sure that you have quality from the get go and grow that quality.

56:50.101 --> 56:51.501
So I have some concerns.

56:51.921 --> 57:01.044
My question is around I'm trying to get a little bit better understanding of the context of this district and the several non-site based

57:02.685 --> 57:15.396
charter schools in there, because while I agree that the enrollment is unrealistic based on the small number of district students, there's reference that you'll be drawing from outside of the district.

57:15.516 --> 57:24.123
I don't know how far away those other districts are, and also I don't, and what's the context of those other charter schools?

57:24.243 --> 57:27.466
Would you be drawing students from those other charter schools, or are they?

57:29.388 --> 57:31.989
Not necessarily, no, unless they choose to come to us.

57:32.109 --> 57:37.733
We haven't had people from those independent charter schools that were involved.

57:38.334 --> 57:48.921
We live in a community, in an area that's like 15 minutes from each other, these small, small communities right there, and so parents are used to driving to different areas.

57:49.041 --> 57:57.126
There used to be a school there as well, where parents drove all the way from Santa Clarita and then Lancaster to come to school there.

57:57.206 --> 57:58.047
So it's not,

57:59.347 --> 58:01.848
You don't have to drive too far to get there.

58:02.268 --> 58:07.609
In fact, the location of the property is really on the boundary.

58:07.889 --> 58:15.710
It's actually a little bit closer to Santa Clarita than to the main Actinago Dulce location as well.

58:16.150 --> 58:21.951
So it just so happens that it's right there and it's a very reasonable facility.

58:21.991 --> 58:27.712
But the driving distance from one area to the other within that community is not that far.

58:29.386 --> 58:35.390
So it's possible for all these parents, and they know that, and that's why they come from different areas.

58:40.674 --> 58:42.775
Well, I have to say that I'm confused.

58:42.795 --> 58:47.098
First of all, good morning, and thank you very much for being here today.

58:47.645 --> 58:57.815
Let me congratulate you, first of all, for the innovation that you all have taken in your approach to trying to create this program.

58:57.855 --> 59:04.982
An international baccalaureate program is probably one of the most difficult types of academic endeavors

59:05.382 --> 59:07.783
that you could try to create for students.

59:08.243 --> 59:18.546
The first time I learned about IB, I actually was jealous and wished I could be immediately reincarnated so I could have the chance to go back to school as a student and participate in a program like that.

59:18.606 --> 59:28.269
So I think the work that you're trying to do falls greatly within the spirit of the charter school law about creating innovation, creating

59:28.829 --> 59:31.671
unique educational opportunities for students.

59:32.171 --> 59:34.113
So I'm not confused about that.

59:34.653 --> 59:47.422
I'm actually confused as a member of this particular dais on this particular conversation because a lot of times when we get to this appeal level, I have actually heard my colleagues

59:47.882 --> 01:00:06.274
talk about the importance of the innovation and the importance of creating these alternatives in these communities over all other matters concerning the problems that may have been identified about the development or creation of the school in the first place.

01:00:06.334 --> 01:00:15.180
So I'm confused that I'm hearing prioritization of issues that previously have not always been the concern.

01:00:15.881 --> 01:00:17.182
But that's my confusion.

01:00:17.802 --> 01:00:30.311
What I'm not confused about is that your petition has been heard several times by a couple of different school districts and several times by the same county school board.

01:00:30.351 --> 01:00:31.592
And it's been reviewed several times.

01:00:31.632 --> 01:00:34.233
And there are commonalities of concerns that have been raised

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.701
in all of those hearings.

01:00:46.162 --> 01:00:53.406
And so what I have clearly heard is the distinct impression that some of those issues have not been addressed.

01:00:53.426 --> 01:00:56.088
So I'm going to identify the things that I've heard.

01:00:56.829 --> 01:01:00.471
My colleagues are not going to give me the time to ask all the questions I want.

01:01:00.511 --> 01:01:03.153
So I'm going to give you a choice after I list all the issues.

01:01:03.833 --> 01:01:13.500
EL students, suspensions and expulsions, the IB program, your enrollment, your facilities, and this thing about the E permit.

01:01:14.261 --> 01:01:16.824
So I'm setting aside suspension and expulsions.

01:01:16.864 --> 01:01:21.509
That's about what's in the law and whether or not your petition adequately addresses that.

01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:29.579
My colleague's only gonna let me ask you a couple of questions about one of those issues, because they don't have that kind of patience, and I appreciate that.

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.442
I'm just looking and saying, because I know they don't have enough.

01:01:34.504 --> 01:01:37.466
So which one of those issues with now and I'm gonna tell you right now.

01:01:37.586 --> 01:01:43.690
I have some really hard questions So which one of those issues would you like me to ask my questions about?

01:01:43.710 --> 01:02:00.602
I think I want to address the facility issue because he was Talked about it seemed like at the Advisory Commission as meetings The idea of enrollment was a little bit resolved and even the IV was seemed like it was resolved Okay, but there's a difference between enrollment and facility.

01:02:00.702 --> 01:02:01.582
So that's what I'm saying.

01:02:01.622 --> 01:02:04.204
So I would like to I would like the facility one

01:02:04.544 --> 01:02:19.193
Okay so I'm gonna start I'm gonna stick with the facilities issue because I agree I don't believe your petition clarifies exactly what you're being asked to address on the facilities issue.

01:02:19.573 --> 01:02:31.200
So if I understand you correctly you're going to be in your plan is to have two classes of kindergarten through eighth grade students but you'll have one eighth grade class right?

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:34.722
Can you tell me how many rooms that means you need to have?

01:02:35.602 --> 01:02:38.503
So, in the building itself.

01:02:38.723 --> 01:02:39.984
No, no, that's not what I asked you.

01:02:40.364 --> 01:02:49.849
Can you tell me how many rooms that means you need to have to have two classrooms in each grade level and one eighth grade class?

01:02:49.869 --> 01:02:49.849
18?

01:02:50.429 --> 01:02:50.789
Okay.

01:02:51.089 --> 01:02:53.771
So those are just classrooms, correct?

01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:55.671
Where's the cafeteria?

01:02:56.232 --> 01:02:56.792
In the building.

01:02:57.182 --> 01:02:58.462
Where are the bathrooms?

01:02:59.643 --> 01:03:02.083
Where are the offices for the administration?

01:03:03.044 --> 01:03:04.064
Is there a library?

01:03:04.084 --> 01:03:08.265
Yes or no, is there a library?

01:03:08.825 --> 01:03:11.766
Okay.

01:03:12.166 --> 01:03:19.888
Are there any other supplementary or adjunct facilities for students for other types of activities like P.E.

01:03:19.989 --> 01:03:21.569
or music or anything like that?

01:03:25.762 --> 01:03:29.903
classrooms, you know, double portable classrooms, right?

01:03:29.963 --> 01:03:34.805
So they come in 24 by 60, I believe, and they're double classrooms.

01:03:35.105 --> 01:03:40.206
So even though it says 13, they're actually 10, and they're double.

01:03:40.446 --> 01:03:48.709
So the one that the eighth grade students will be in, the way we design, and I have, you know, a little plan here that we're just using on our own.

01:03:48.949 --> 01:03:52.290
So inside the building, the pre-K through

01:03:53.353 --> 01:04:03.596
Third grade will accommodate in the building with the cafeteria and the hall and the offices and the restrooms as well.

01:04:04.556 --> 01:04:12.799
And then outside the portables, there will be five double portables and four through eight will be there.

01:04:12.859 --> 01:04:17.500
The additional one where the eighth graders will be is what we're calling the academic center.

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:25.706
Okay, so this gets then to the nut of the question about the timeline and the work that has to be done on the facilities.

01:04:26.166 --> 01:04:38.776
I very clearly heard both from the county office, as well as from the district, and from our staff, and I actually pulled the tape and listened to some of the deliberations from the ACCS.

01:04:39.296 --> 01:04:41.019
about the work that would be done.

01:04:41.059 --> 01:04:45.605
So I think you may have delved into and answered this question.

01:04:45.906 --> 01:04:56.300
You have clearly stated that there is work that would have to be done for the portables that you are going to receive in order for you to be able to house two classrooms in each of those buildings.

01:04:59.202 --> 01:05:00.643
Let me finish my question.

01:05:01.744 --> 01:05:07.188
So there's work that would need to be done in the church building you have in order for it to meet.

01:05:07.309 --> 01:05:09.790
There's three different requirements you have to meet.

01:05:10.171 --> 01:05:11.292
The zoning code

01:05:12.128 --> 01:05:18.853
the permitting code requirements, as well as the building code requirements to house children in a school.

01:05:19.473 --> 01:05:28.539
What are the current requirements just for the church building you have that need to be addressed to meet each of those three requirements?

01:05:28.699 --> 01:05:39.267
So we went back, because in our conversations with the engineers and the regional planning engineers as well, they told us that we didn't need a conditional use permit.

01:05:39.327 --> 01:05:41.168
So we went back and we get the letter.

01:05:41.528 --> 01:05:43.049
I'm not interested in what they told you.

01:05:43.089 --> 01:05:54.293
You need to be clear we're telling you what you have to get based on what you were told by our staff that you would have to get to be a state board authorized school.

01:05:54.753 --> 01:06:03.216
What are the zoning, building code, and permitting requirements that you have to address in the church building itself today?

01:06:03.556 --> 01:06:09.784
There will be no zoning because it's already zone C3 and that could be used for schools.

01:06:10.225 --> 01:06:18.536
But you understand we require an E permit not a C. I know the two letters rhyme but there's a difference between a C and an E.

01:06:19.753 --> 01:06:22.855
Well, the C is a commercial building.

01:06:22.915 --> 01:06:28.678
So a commercial building could be used to make an e-occupancy.

01:06:29.298 --> 01:06:32.740
So that's what the zoning verification letter is explaining.

01:06:33.361 --> 01:06:39.124
And that's what we haven't really had conversation because facility was not something that the staff came up with.

01:06:39.604 --> 01:06:57.221
The city staff usually isn't so we really have not had a sit-down Conversation with them to discuss what was happening It was just because that advisory commissioners brought it up and we started talking about that And so to make it a little bit more specific for you.

01:06:57.521 --> 01:06:58.943
We went to get those things.

01:06:59.203 --> 01:07:00.784
But yes the permit

01:07:01.565 --> 01:07:08.390
is that if we needed a permit, then we would have to do a conditional use permit, which takes quite a bit.

01:07:08.810 --> 01:07:14.774
But we don't need to do a conditional use permit in order to use a church as a school.

01:07:15.191 --> 01:07:24.581
So it's your opinion that there's nothing else you would need to do to the church building itself in order to satisfy the board's requirement that you have an E permit.

01:07:24.841 --> 01:07:25.722
Is that your opinion?

01:07:25.782 --> 01:07:33.791
That's what the Los Angeles County Department of Regional Planning told us.

01:07:34.431 --> 01:07:35.533
Let me be specific.

01:07:36.781 --> 01:07:42.202
The Los Angeles County Office of Regional Planning is not here for me to ask them any questions.

01:07:42.242 --> 01:07:43.403
I'm just asking you.

01:07:43.963 --> 01:07:46.024
So I want to make sure I understand.

01:07:46.364 --> 01:07:57.827
It's your opinion and it's your assertion today that your building is fine with the C permit you have and the E permit we're asking for, in your opinion, is a non-issue.

01:07:58.207 --> 01:07:58.847
Is that correct?

01:07:59.178 --> 01:08:06.602
Well, I think that staff would have to come and address that because there is no EAP from me.

01:08:06.922 --> 01:08:07.602
It's okay.

01:08:07.942 --> 01:08:08.403
I got you.

01:08:08.563 --> 01:08:08.743
Okay.

01:08:08.763 --> 01:08:09.203
I got you.

01:08:09.983 --> 01:08:10.564
All right.

01:08:10.784 --> 01:08:13.945
I'm going to ask that we try to bring this to a point.

01:08:14.045 --> 01:08:17.047
And then for the other buildings that are outside of the church.

01:08:17.627 --> 01:08:22.312
You're going to be leasing those and there's some retrofitting requirements that have to be done.

01:08:22.792 --> 01:08:34.083
Now, like Board Member Ortiz-Lacon, I've also had experience with getting portables on a campus and doing all the retrofitting requirements, particularly as it relates to accessibility issues.

01:08:36.026 --> 01:08:44.830
You have in your budget a little over $275,000 for the modules and you identified something else that you're also setting aside in your budget.

01:08:45.350 --> 01:08:51.293
For the number of portables and the amount of work that you're doing, I can tell you right now, that's not enough money.

01:08:51.813 --> 01:09:03.087
the district that I worked in, which is now Twin Rivers, spent considerably more money on considerably fewer portables, particularly to do the retrofitting requirements for the accessibility issues.

01:09:03.487 --> 01:09:08.654
What are you basing the dollar amounts that you have in your budget on for all of those portables?

01:09:09.090 --> 01:09:28.073
because we're going to be leasing the portables, not buying them, and also because the class, the people, the organizations that sell classroom, modular class, I mean class, modular classrooms, they usually have to be e-ready by the state before they can sell it.

01:09:28.593 --> 01:09:36.359
So those buildings come, they will certify that it's already E-ready, and all they have to do is just set it up.

01:09:36.899 --> 01:09:46.826
And they actually, in the quote that we submitted to you guys, just so you can have an idea of what it looks like, it shows what it takes to set it up and how much it will cost to remove it.

01:09:47.166 --> 01:09:48.467
And so that's for a 12-year project.

01:09:49.848 --> 01:09:51.109
a 12-month lease.

01:09:51.449 --> 01:09:55.191
And so it is within our budget, because our intention was always to lease it.

01:09:55.631 --> 01:10:07.918
It was never something that we've had an opportunity to really have a good conversation with staff, because they never came up with that as a finding and didn't have questions about our facility.

01:10:08.179 --> 01:10:08.459
OK.

01:10:08.579 --> 01:10:09.579
Thank you very much.

01:10:09.659 --> 01:10:15.623
I appreciate you letting me, and my colleagues also, for letting me do a deep dive on those pieces.

01:10:15.703 --> 01:10:16.063
Thank you.

01:10:16.323 --> 01:10:16.863
Thank you, ma'am.

01:10:20.645 --> 01:10:21.486
Good morning.

01:10:21.707 --> 01:10:23.329
Thank you for being here.

01:10:23.709 --> 01:10:26.633
I want to commend you on the vision that you have.

01:10:27.373 --> 01:10:35.323
It seems no doubt to me that in that district they need a school-based charter program for students to access and outside.

01:10:35.343 --> 01:10:39.428
I have the privilege of opening three charter schools and

01:10:40.609 --> 01:10:42.650
have the understanding of the facility requirements.

01:10:43.791 --> 01:10:53.617
And what I'm concerned about is the facility, but also that you have a lot that you're riding on that is outside your control.

01:10:53.637 --> 01:11:04.203
A lot of things have to fall in place by September 30th for students to get what they need based on the promises you're bringing to the table.

01:11:05.084 --> 01:11:07.906
In addition to that, there are promises around the IB program.

01:11:08.766 --> 01:11:18.697
And so my question is, the knowledge of the IB program is residing in the external provider at this point, correct?

01:11:18.737 --> 01:11:29.348
You have one staff member that has spent some time learning about what the IB requirements are, but in terms of the knowledge of that and how it unfolds, it's in an external provider at this point.

01:11:31.668 --> 01:11:41.230
because the teachers would have to be trained and IB doesn't require for the teachers to be already trained in order to implement IB, PYP, and MYP.

01:11:41.370 --> 01:11:42.930
And the bulk of that training would come?

01:11:43.450 --> 01:11:44.891
It will come during the summer.

01:11:44.951 --> 01:11:51.652
We're going to have a two-day, 15-hour training that is a requirement that will come and do it face-to-face.

01:11:52.132 --> 01:12:00.154
And then in our calendar, excuse me, bell schedule, we have days, hours built in on Wednesday through this.

01:12:01.575 --> 01:12:05.457
I'm so sorry, where they have opportunity to meet and collaborate.

01:12:05.497 --> 01:12:09.699
That is something that we really, really put a lot of emphasis in.

01:12:09.719 --> 01:12:22.005
So we have built it into the schedule that every Wednesday, they'll have two hours in the afternoon from one, three hours from one to four to be able to continue to collaborate and learn and grow.

01:12:22.025 --> 01:12:22.705
Well, I commend you.

01:12:22.885 --> 01:12:25.026
And I think dreaming big is important.

01:12:25.306 --> 01:12:27.287
And I think kids need options and opportunities.

01:12:27.767 --> 01:12:30.029
At this point, I'm struggling with so much.

01:12:30.069 --> 01:12:30.809
It's out of your control.

01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:33.110
I just wanted to say one thing, though.

01:12:34.170 --> 01:12:47.814
The, again, the county, thank you so much, the county regional planners, and I know it's not CDE, and since we haven't had that conversation with them, I don't know, other than what we're hearing today, what they think.

01:12:48.474 --> 01:12:57.617
But the county regional planners, who are the ones who will certify us to meet CDE requirements, told us the building permit.

01:12:58.846 --> 01:13:05.910
that they will finish this in two months or less because they're doing building permits.

01:13:06.050 --> 01:13:07.791
They're familiar with the building.

01:13:07.851 --> 01:13:12.774
We're not retrofitting the building.

01:13:12.794 --> 01:13:14.996
We're gonna use the rooms as they are.

01:13:15.416 --> 01:13:22.760
We're just gonna paint, do all those kinds of things and bring them up because he has those things in there already.

01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:24.621
So we're not gonna knock anything down.

01:13:25.222 --> 01:13:27.243
We can put a panel, but things like that.

01:13:27.763 --> 01:13:30.925
And because of that, they believe that it could be done.

01:13:30.945 --> 01:13:42.033
In fact, they said since we're at school, yeah, these are their words, and we have their cards, that they can even have their office managers bump us up to help us if that is necessary.

01:13:42.073 --> 01:13:43.994
And so these are the conversations we've had.

01:13:44.034 --> 01:13:50.258
And then they talked to the land engineering as well to confirm what needs to be done, the civil engineering team.

01:13:56.403 --> 01:13:59.187
Comments or questions from members of the board?

01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:02.011
Sue?

01:14:04.394 --> 01:14:05.115
I'm sorry, Eileen?

01:14:07.205 --> 01:14:25.781
Just a comment to the board, I've been actually to another school based charter out in Santa Clarita and actually a project based one that's actually been around for a long time and realized the need for classroom based charters versus the remote online and school resource centers.

01:14:26.361 --> 01:14:31.426
Again I think the IB base and the philosophy and the community

01:14:32.346 --> 01:14:41.572
The commitment to that philosophy and training is a strong one, in my opinion, and I believe you hear a community that would really like their own school.

01:14:42.072 --> 01:14:48.196
My worry is we're in May, and those of us who've run schools and know what the issues are, I think the timeline's really short.

01:14:48.856 --> 01:15:13.213
and parents saying interest in actually enrolling is one the actual is a little discrepant between those that are enrolling because if I was a parent of all those kindergarten kids 88 kids I would want to know I have a seat in case this one doesn't open and then so I don't know that even though they might be interested the reality of 155 kids coming the other thing is our experiences in growing charters and the ones that

01:15:13.593 --> 01:15:18.254
is that they tend to grow, say, K-2, K-3, and then eventually grow.

01:15:18.794 --> 01:15:21.155
So I feel like they're trying to go K-8 all at once.

01:15:21.395 --> 01:15:30.457
And those of us who've led schools realize the philosophy in developing an early ed program, and then the early grades, and then the middle school is a whole different game.

01:15:30.557 --> 01:15:34.478
And I just think there's a lot of staffing issues in a short amount of time to roll up.

01:15:34.818 --> 01:15:42.643
So I guess I'm worried on the timing and also the phase-in process of it, but I certainly think the intention and the commitment I.B.

01:15:42.703 --> 01:15:46.865
and the opportunity to provide parents with another option in the area is an important one.

01:15:47.445 --> 01:15:49.947
I would just second those thoughts.

01:15:49.987 --> 01:15:51.728
I think the commitment and the

01:15:52.728 --> 01:15:54.909
Effort that's been put into it is really commendable.

01:15:54.969 --> 01:16:08.776
There's clearly a need in that a region and so we have to consider the petition as it is, but it is Definitely appreciated both the vision and efforts that have been undertaken.

01:16:08.796 --> 01:16:08.816
I

01:16:10.966 --> 01:16:26.580
So I would just echo my colleagues comments and express my appreciation to the petitioners for your Vision for your desire to try to provide an opportunity in an area that seems to be underserved But I am afraid I am persuaded by the department that

01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:43.183
well as our colleagues on the Advisory Commission for Charter Schools and I would therefore move the department's recommendation to deny the request to establish the Eagle Collegiate Academy under the oversight of the SBE for the reasons that they articulated.

01:16:45.984 --> 01:16:46.684
To that motion?

01:16:46.704 --> 01:16:50.325
Is there any other discussion of the motion?

01:16:55.046 --> 01:16:56.386
Hearing no more discussion

01:16:57.970 --> 01:16:59.311
All in favor, aye.

01:17:00.772 --> 01:17:01.433
Any opposed?

01:17:02.753 --> 01:17:03.574
Any abstentions?

01:17:05.515 --> 01:17:05.896
Thank you.

01:17:05.916 --> 01:17:13.521
10 or 15 minute break.

01:17:13.581 --> 01:17:20.887
I think the second petition for the rest of the public hearing is actually delayed in the airport or maybe they've arrived.

01:17:20.967 --> 01:17:21.607
Okay, great.

01:17:21.927 --> 01:17:24.029
But we'll still take a 10 minute break because we need one.

01:17:34.389 --> 01:17:57.968
Okay we're delighted that the folks who were stranded in Los Angeles have managed to get here but we are going to take item 18 next which is public comment because we have a public commenter on a particular time schedule so we're going to open public comment now.

01:17:59.173 --> 01:18:06.926
So for public comment, we have two speakers, Rigel Massaro and Elizabeth Chislett, who may actually have been for the prior item.

01:18:08.128 --> 01:18:08.849
OK.

01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:10.531
We'll find out.

01:18:11.052 --> 01:18:11.333
Rigel.

01:18:11.772 --> 01:18:15.053
Board Chair and members, Rigel Massaro on behalf of Public Advocates.

01:18:15.513 --> 01:18:23.835
We have some significant legal concerns about CDE's implementation of ESSA's requirement to report inequities in students' access to quality teachers.

01:18:24.336 --> 01:18:28.157
Now in the LCAP addendum and forthcoming state report to the U.S.

01:18:28.177 --> 01:18:28.997
Department of Education,

01:18:29.657 --> 01:18:42.829
Contrary to the board-adopted ESSA plan definitions, CDE is treating provisional permit holders as credentialed teachers and thus is not including them in either the ineffective or out-of-field teacher designations.

01:18:42.989 --> 01:18:47.353
This position contravenes the plan itself, its procedural history, and state certification law.

01:18:47.993 --> 01:18:51.935
Under NCLB and state law, permit holders have never been highly qualified or fully certified.

01:18:52.155 --> 01:19:00.580
The board intended to align ESSA with priority one under LCFF and therefore originally defined ineffective as either misassigned or those serving without a full credential.

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:07.624
Ultimately, full was deleted so that in addition to preliminary and clear credentials, intern credentials would also be considered effective.

01:19:08.004 --> 01:19:10.506
Permit holders were never defined effective by the board.

01:19:11.006 --> 01:19:18.012
CDE's confusion will grossly distort the real distribution of underprepared and ineffective teachers in schools serving low income and students of color.

01:19:18.032 --> 01:19:18.372
Thank you.

01:19:25.378 --> 01:19:26.138
Public advocates.

01:19:27.559 --> 01:19:29.661
And do we have another commenter?

01:19:32.491 --> 01:19:34.214
I think they might have been for the last item.

01:19:34.414 --> 01:19:37.860
They signed up with Eagle Collegiate as their affiliated organization.

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:41.686
Elizabeth was at the podium at one point, so I think we're done.

01:19:48.934 --> 01:20:03.085
Item on the establishment, the request for reauthorization of International Charter School, and I'm gonna start with Lisa.

01:20:06.287 --> 01:20:17.376
Okay, item number 16 is for Los Angeles International Charter High School, and this is a renewal petition, but it is for establishment as a school under the authorization of the state board.

01:20:17.556 --> 01:20:18.477
Excuse me.

01:20:20.262 --> 01:20:29.547
On January 22, 2019, the Los Angeles County Board of Education denied the Los Angeles International Charter High School renewal petition by a vote of 5 to 1.

01:20:30.167 --> 01:20:33.669
The petitioners then submitted a renewal petition to the State Board on January 28, 2019.

01:20:37.014 --> 01:20:42.965
The California Department of Education recommendation is that the State Board hold a public hearing to deny the request to renew L.A.

01:20:43.766 --> 01:20:50.318
High School International, a 9th through grade 12 charter school, under the oversight of the State Board of Education.

01:20:52.267 --> 01:21:03.898
The recommendation is based on that the petitioner does not meet the renewal criteria as they do not perform overall, at least equal to its comparable district schools where the majority of the pupils would otherwise attend.

01:21:04.538 --> 01:21:10.784
And additionally, the petition does not provide a reasonably comprehensive description of eight of the 15 required charter elements.

01:21:13.151 --> 01:21:16.875
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools met on April 10, 2019.

01:21:17.335 --> 01:21:21.520
The Advisory Commission moved staff recommendation to deny the petition to the state board.

01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:24.983
The motion did not pass by a vote of 4 to 4.

01:21:25.584 --> 01:21:30.389
Five votes are required to move an Advisory Commission motion forward to the board and a recommendation.

01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:32.451
Therefore, no recommendation was moved.

01:21:35.086 --> 01:21:36.647
A little bit of background on the school.

01:21:36.727 --> 01:21:39.790
They have been operating since 2005.

01:21:40.250 --> 01:21:44.534
They're currently serving 153 pupils in grades nine through grades 12.

01:21:45.234 --> 01:21:49.137
They're located within the geographic boundaries of the LA Unified School District.

01:21:50.018 --> 01:22:02.468
The petitioner, as part of their renewal package, is also proposing to add grade six through grade eight, an independent study program, and to change the name of the school to LA International Charter School.

01:22:05.256 --> 01:22:15.751
Their mission is to provide pupil achievement by providing a high, to improve pupil achievement, excuse me, by providing a high quality standards-based educational program for all pupils that attend.

01:22:16.271 --> 01:22:22.460
They focus on college preparatory program, college readiness for all its pupils, and a personalized learning environment.

01:22:25.146 --> 01:22:49.064
As I mentioned, if renewed, the petition is proposing to add grade 6 and increase to 172 pupils in grade 6 and grade 9 through grade 12 in the first year, which would be 19-19-19-20, and then increase to serve 240 pupils in grade 6 through grade 12, so then adding on the 7th and 8th grade as well by the end of the five-year term in 2023-24.

01:22:53.519 --> 01:23:01.902
Now in terms of renewal criteria for the establishment, we talked about the education code that determines how we look at establishments as new schools.

01:23:02.542 --> 01:23:05.403
This is the criteria that is set forth for renewal.

01:23:05.583 --> 01:23:09.804
So education code 47607 sets forth that criteria.

01:23:10.284 --> 01:23:22.548
The authority that granted the charter shall consider increases in pupil academic achievement for all groups of pupils served by the charter school as the most important factor determining whether to grant a charter renewal.

01:23:23.328 --> 01:23:47.439
The entity that granted the charter determines that the academic performance of the charter school is at least equal to the academic performance of the public schools that the charter school pupils would otherwise have been required to attend and the academic performance of the schools in the school district in which the charter school is located, taking into account the composition of the pupil population that has served at the charter school.

01:23:47.779 --> 01:23:53.782
So we'll talk a little bit more about this, but this is where our comparison schools come into play.

01:23:54.142 --> 01:24:01.126
And then also as we select those comparison schools, the demographics of those schools as well to meet this area of the education code.

01:24:03.885 --> 01:24:08.207
The renewal criteria under 52052 talks about alternative measures.

01:24:09.388 --> 01:24:17.153
Three parts of this education code still refer to the academic performance indicator, the API, as you all know, hasn't been calculated since 2013-14.

01:24:17.193 --> 01:24:29.620
There still is one provision of the education code that, in F, that provides for the following in determining whether a charter is meeting legislative or programmatic requirements.

01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:39.183
It states the alternative measures that show increases in pupil academic performance for all groups of pupils school-wide and among numerically significant pupils shall be used.

01:24:39.984 --> 01:24:49.487
And for CDE we use CASP data and which is then reflected also in the dashboard as the alternative measure criteria for purposes of renewal.

01:24:53.144 --> 01:25:11.279
For the comparison school that CDE did, we selected seven schools where the pupils would have otherwise been required to attend, selected these schools within a five-mile radius of the current high school, schools that were similar enrollment for Hispanic Latinos, special ed, English learners, and pupils with disabilities.

01:25:14.232 --> 01:25:28.586
In the following two tables, we have the first chart is the percent of pupils that met or exceeded on the 2015-16 through 2017-18 CASP assessments for ELA and math for the school and the CDE comparable schools.

01:25:28.987 --> 01:25:37.655
And then the second chart is the demographic data that we talked about just a moment ago for the LA International School and then the CDE comparable schools.

01:25:38.596 --> 01:25:51.543
The data shows that the decreases in ELA and significant decreases in math results in 2016-17 and 17-18, and that LA International does not perform overall at least comparable to the district schools.

01:25:52.803 --> 01:25:54.084
So this is the first chart.

01:25:54.864 --> 01:25:56.725
You all have the presentation in your inboxes.

01:25:56.785 --> 01:25:59.887
I know this is a little small, but if you want to refer to it there.

01:26:00.667 --> 01:26:03.089
So LA International High School is here at the top.

01:26:03.929 --> 01:26:09.732
And then the schools that CDE used in terms of comparable schools are listed here as well.

01:26:10.552 --> 01:26:15.535
The two asterisk are ones that LACO also used in their comparison schools as well.

01:26:18.316 --> 01:26:27.061
And then the second chart is the demographic information and to just break down that information so you can see why we selected these schools.

01:26:30.595 --> 01:26:36.899
Now in terms of the dashboard and the summary report, so Cindy is here because I'm still learning this language.

01:26:36.939 --> 01:26:39.520
So she is here in case we have any questions about the dashboard.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.002
But the 2017 California School Dashboard Summary Report is listed here.

01:26:44.743 --> 01:26:51.346
Since in 2017 it did not include, the dashboard didn't include the academic indicators for ELA and math.

01:26:51.587 --> 01:26:52.747
You won't see that here.

01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:56.549
But they also didn't submit information for the local indicators in 2017.

01:26:59.771 --> 01:27:08.336
So as we go further into the 2017 dashboard indicator report, they are green here in graduation rate and yellow in suspension rate.

01:27:11.147 --> 01:27:14.831
And then we go to the 2018 California School Dashboard Summary Report.

01:27:15.211 --> 01:27:18.615
So this is the first year of the academic indicator for high school.

01:27:18.695 --> 01:27:23.901
So ELA and math here does have a color, yellow for ELA, red for math.

01:27:24.962 --> 01:27:28.125
And then the suspension rate did come down to red.

01:27:29.347 --> 01:27:33.131
And the graduation rate, still green, and college career.

01:27:36.215 --> 01:27:39.538
So looking further into this, ELA, here's the yellow.

01:27:39.598 --> 01:27:41.760
They are 15.4 points below standard.

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:49.447
But for mathematics is the most concerning being in red and 131.7 points below standard here on the dashboard.

01:27:52.950 --> 01:27:56.913
Graduation rate being in green, and then the suspension rate came down to red.

01:28:01.437 --> 01:28:03.219
So this is the breakdown for ELA.

01:28:05.367 --> 01:28:11.712
And then, I'm sorry, by student subgroup, by all student subgroups, and then student subgroups by performance level.

01:28:13.474 --> 01:28:16.616
So yellow in Hispanic and socioeconomically disadvantaged.

01:28:17.797 --> 01:28:31.028
And then for math for 2018, for all student subgroups being in red, orange for the socioeconomically disadvantaged, and here more detailed information on each of the subgroups.

01:28:34.645 --> 01:28:50.906
So in LACO's review of the renewal criteria, they did complete a review of 2015-16 through 2017-18 CASP assessment data as well for not only district comparable schools, but they also did a look at resident schools.

01:28:52.147 --> 01:28:56.770
They found declines in English and ELA and math school-wide and for all pupil groups.

01:28:57.510 --> 01:29:04.714
And they determined that they had not demonstrated increases in pupil academic performance for all groups of pupils served by the school.

01:29:09.277 --> 01:29:21.163
They went on to determine they do not qualify for renewal criteria as its academic performance is not at least equal to the academic performance of the public schools that the pupils would otherwise have been required to attend.

01:29:25.225 --> 01:29:30.110
So this first chart is of the county chosen resident schools.

01:29:31.331 --> 01:29:32.533
And so they have two charts.

01:29:32.573 --> 01:29:35.276
They did one on resident schools and then one on comparable schools.

01:29:35.356 --> 01:29:42.163
This is the first chart here of the resident schools and the second chart is of the comparison schools.

01:29:48.109 --> 01:29:57.172
CDE's review of the LACO finding, CDE determined that LACO's review and analysis of the pupil academic data pursuant to the Ed Code was comprehensive.

01:29:58.093 --> 01:30:07.076
They did consider increases in pupil academic performance for all groups of people served by the school as the most important factor in determining whether to grant renewal.

01:30:11.113 --> 01:30:17.698
And the school itself, in the review of their renewal criteria, they compared their own CASP data for 15-16 through 17-18.

01:30:17.998 --> 01:30:25.964
The data reflected a decline in academic performance in 2016-17 and a small increase in 17-18.

01:30:26.664 --> 01:30:32.328
And they do acknowledge the challenge the school is experiencing with academic performance of pupils in mathematics.

01:30:32.789 --> 01:30:38.853
And they are committed to continual improvement through comprehensive ongoing professional development for all their staff.

01:30:43.190 --> 01:30:56.123
CDE notes that in the school's response to LACO's findings, they stated that LACO instructed them to use the same resident and comparison schools in their charter renewal, despite their objections that the list of the schools were flawed.

01:30:56.163 --> 01:30:58.606
And this is coming from what the petitioner has stated.

01:30:59.166 --> 01:31:06.614
They included a table of resident and comparison schools that the petitioner states are more accurate representation of the schools and reflect the increases.

01:31:07.655 --> 01:31:15.247
The petitioner stated that they did not include these tables in the renewal petition because they were directed by LACO to stick with their schools that they had chosen.

01:31:18.604 --> 01:31:24.187
In terms of alternative measures, the school does not meet the renewal criteria under 47607.

01:31:25.027 --> 01:31:28.889
We did review the additional alternative measures information provided by the school.

01:31:29.089 --> 01:31:39.034
The data reflects increases in 17-18 results in ELA and math for all pupils when compared to 16-17 only, so only for one year of comparison.

01:31:40.295 --> 01:31:56.425
However, the data they presented for AP passage rates, they submitted some information for college acceptance rates, enrollment and honors in AP, that information relies on assessments for which we do not have independent confirmation of their reliability, validity, fairness, and alignment.

01:31:56.445 --> 01:32:00.068
So we are not able to make an assessment on that information that was submitted to us.

01:32:01.297 --> 01:32:06.343
We do note that LACO did not consider academic performance under the alternative measures criteria.

01:32:06.383 --> 01:32:14.614
Their assessment was done on 47607, which is the initial renewal criteria, whether academic performance being the most highest standard.

01:32:14.714 --> 01:32:16.456
So they just didn't look at alternative measures.

01:32:20.343 --> 01:32:27.689
Also, in terms of the petition itself, we do have concerns about several of the elements that are lacking in the charter petition.

01:32:28.689 --> 01:32:33.233
The petition does not overall present a reasonably comprehensive description of the educational program.

01:32:33.593 --> 01:32:40.138
They are proposing to add grade levels, which is the grades six through eight, as I mentioned, and also independent study.

01:32:40.719 --> 01:32:51.096
So with the current CASP scores at the high school level, we are concerned the petitioner wants to add additional grade levels as well, as well as an additional independent study program.

01:32:51.116 --> 01:32:52.479
So we are concerned about that.

01:32:54.170 --> 01:33:02.957
In terms of serving English learners, the petition does not include several areas that we typically see in a petition, a plan for serving ELs, description of the program.

01:33:03.358 --> 01:33:11.585
They include a master plan, but the plan appears to be outdated and doesn't cite the correct statewide assessments that we would typically see.

01:33:12.485 --> 01:33:19.189
Integrated and designated English language development is not included and there's not enough of a description about reclassification as well.

01:33:19.309 --> 01:33:28.754
So there's some pieces really lacking in the petition that if it was renewed, we would really have to work with the school to better identify.

01:33:30.355 --> 01:33:33.456
In terms of their ability to implement fiscally, they are fiscally viable.

01:33:33.997 --> 01:33:35.738
Their projected budget is viable.

01:33:35.758 --> 01:33:39.780
They do have positive ending fund balances and they do have plenty of reserves as well.

01:33:43.986 --> 01:33:49.510
So as I mentioned, there are several of the charter elements that the petition does not include.

01:33:50.171 --> 01:33:54.554
Eight of the 15 are not reasonably comprehensive.

01:33:54.594 --> 01:34:09.184
The most material ones I've listed here in this slide, measurable pupil outcomes, method for measuring pupil progress, employee qualification, admissions requirements, and then suspension and expulsion procedures are the most material ones that we are concerned about.

01:34:10.709 --> 01:34:24.300
In terms of measurable pupil outcomes, the petition outlines the baseline performance level, annual goals, et cetera, but they're not in alignment with the eight state priorities, and the tables do not include the pupil outcomes for all pupils for each subgroup.

01:34:27.921 --> 01:34:35.947
Also in terms of the method for measuring pupil progress, we don't have the assessment tools lined out.

01:34:36.007 --> 01:34:39.490
They don't describe how they will utilize a variety of these tools.

01:34:40.010 --> 01:34:43.933
And then they don't outline a plan for collecting, analyzing, and reporting pupil data.

01:34:46.420 --> 01:35:03.854
In terms of employee qualifications, they don't identify, the petition does not identify key positions in each categories, additional qualifications expected of these individuals, and then indicate the teachers and curriculum specialists, such as EL coordinators, how they will obtain the special ed certification or the EL authorization.

01:35:06.836 --> 01:35:09.458
We do also have a concern about the admission requirements.

01:35:11.638 --> 01:35:16.260
currently lay out a mandatory enrollment meeting for families.

01:35:17.421 --> 01:35:20.283
And this seems to mandate parental involvement.

01:35:20.323 --> 01:35:27.046
So we are concerned that that violates the education code as it would limit the school from admitting all pupils who would wish to attend.

01:35:27.566 --> 01:35:30.608
And it also incorrectly lists some admission exemptions as well.

01:35:33.979 --> 01:35:45.345
And then in terms of suspension of expulsion, they do not state that no people shall be involuntarily removed from the school for any reason unless a parent or guardian has been provided written notification to remove the student.

01:35:46.226 --> 01:35:51.269
And they do not state that they will provide a hearing adjudicating by a neutral officer as well.

01:35:51.289 --> 01:35:57.332
So there are some real specific pieces here from the education code that are lacking in the petition.

01:35:59.801 --> 01:36:02.302
In summary, CDE staff is recommending denial.

01:36:02.342 --> 01:36:05.282
The petition is not consistent with sound educational practice.

01:36:05.702 --> 01:36:11.784
It does not perform overall at least equal to its comparable district schools where the majority of the pupils would otherwise attend.

01:36:12.304 --> 01:36:17.845
And the petition does not provide a reasonably comprehensive description of the eight of the 15 required charter elements.

01:36:19.285 --> 01:36:20.866
So this concludes my presentation.

01:36:20.926 --> 01:36:25.267
If there's any questions I can answer at this time.

01:36:28.443 --> 01:36:30.365
Just a couple of clarifying questions.

01:36:30.425 --> 01:36:33.568
Again, thank you, Lisa, for your comprehensive presentation.

01:36:34.929 --> 01:36:38.211
On the alternative measures one, if you could just pull that up for a second.

01:36:39.572 --> 01:36:53.004
We've talked about this before, and I will just express my frustration again publicly about the statute being so outdated, referring to a measure or metric that we haven't used for five years or longer.

01:36:53.644 --> 01:37:07.569
But what I'm a little bit concerned about here is just the comment about the data presented about AP passage rates and enrollment in AP relies on assessments for which we lack independent confirmation.

01:37:08.329 --> 01:37:14.871
I'm a little concerned about that because we've approved AP as part of our college and career readiness indicator.

01:37:14.991 --> 01:37:21.353
So I think to the extent we have independently validated it or Cindy and her staff have,

01:37:22.294 --> 01:37:23.875
I would just be careful about that.

01:37:23.955 --> 01:37:27.318
And I would suggest that that is an appropriate alternative measure.

01:37:28.519 --> 01:37:29.801
So I just wanted to point that out.

01:37:29.921 --> 01:37:46.216
And anything else that's in the CCI that we have approved, especially for a high school, a school that's, I think we need to make sure that we are looking at that and that is a legitimate piece of data or pieces of data to include.

01:37:47.096 --> 01:37:51.939
Then the other just clarification question is on the suspension and expulsion.

01:37:52.059 --> 01:37:58.202
And I think I've heard this in other petitions where there's statutory requirements.

01:37:59.042 --> 01:38:08.207
Do we require petitioners to restate those statutory requirements or we acknowledge that they are, they have to abide by them?

01:38:08.746 --> 01:38:17.530
was signed a couple of years ago that require a charter petition to outline the type of due process and what elements they'll suspend a kid for.

01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:20.912
So that was a couple of years ago Governor Brown signed some legislation.

01:38:24.474 --> 01:38:27.737
And we realize that some of that is still catching up.

01:38:28.478 --> 01:38:32.981
We've had the conversation with other petitioners or other petitions about that.

01:38:33.322 --> 01:38:44.131
So that part we realize is still, that law is still catching up in some of the petitions, but it is still a concern that it has been over a year and that hasn't been changed in this petition, so.

01:38:47.154 --> 01:38:47.394
Lisa?

01:38:49.885 --> 01:38:56.611
I want to echo the point of the APs made by Board Member Burr since we are including it in the CCI.

01:38:57.191 --> 01:39:08.041
However, if I remember correctly, one of the issues with this particular proposal was that the students who pass the AP Spanish, the school does not teach AP Spanish.

01:39:08.361 --> 01:39:12.364
So they couldn't attribute the passage rate to the school.

01:39:12.584 --> 01:39:13.125
Is that correct?

01:39:14.712 --> 01:39:15.792
I don't know that offhand.

01:39:15.913 --> 01:39:17.134
I will have to look into that.

01:39:17.814 --> 01:39:28.563
I believe it's deep into the charter, but that's one thing that I noted that though some students, the passage rate included AP Spanish, the school itself did not teach or provide an AP Spanish course.

01:39:28.863 --> 01:39:33.267
So in that case, I do think that we need to give it a second look.

01:39:33.487 --> 01:39:33.587
Okay.

01:39:33.687 --> 01:39:33.987
Thank you.

01:39:34.107 --> 01:39:34.448
Thank you.

01:39:36.810 --> 01:39:39.712
Clarifying questions right now for Lisa.

01:39:42.222 --> 01:39:46.523
Okay, so we're now gonna hear from the petitioner.

01:39:47.563 --> 01:39:47.823
Yes.

01:39:49.863 --> 01:39:54.644
I open public hearing and we will hear first from the petitioner.

01:39:58.365 --> 01:40:04.546
So the petitioner will have 10 minutes and then that will be followed by the district and the county, well the county in this case.

01:40:04.606 --> 01:40:06.746
If the county, if they're still here, they will have 10 minutes.

01:40:07.287 --> 01:40:09.767
That will be followed by general public comment for one minute.

01:40:56.799 --> 01:40:56.980
Oh.

01:42:00.319 --> 01:42:02.708
We thought we had it, but Stephanie's grabbing it from her drive.

01:42:02.768 --> 01:42:04.032
It should be just a moment.

01:42:41.984 --> 01:42:42.532
No pressure.

01:43:49.659 --> 01:43:50.399
Are we frozen?

01:43:50.499 --> 01:43:59.422
All right, keep us posted.

01:44:29.279 --> 01:44:29.446
you

01:45:09.147 --> 01:45:10.227
All right, here we go.

01:45:11.048 --> 01:45:12.628
We will now hear from the petitioner.

01:45:14.189 --> 01:45:15.110
You have 10 minutes.

01:45:15.130 --> 01:45:23.653
All right, thank you.

01:45:23.953 --> 01:45:25.434
Good morning and thank you for having us.

01:45:27.059 --> 01:45:37.208
as they expressed that our mission is that we produce leaders in our community, in our school, and that they are college ready and that they are ready for life beyond college.

01:45:37.489 --> 01:45:39.691
I just want to share a little bit of history very quickly.

01:45:40.311 --> 01:45:46.637
I've been at the school for less than three years, and that was due to a turnover of administration and teachers in 2016.

01:45:47.018 --> 01:45:48.019
There was also a death.

01:45:49.179 --> 01:45:54.802
where our students witnessed one of our students being hit by an 18-wheeler, and that was very impactful.

01:45:55.262 --> 01:46:01.906
So you did see a drop and a decline in everything that happened at that school in 2016.

01:46:02.306 --> 01:46:12.911
They called me and asked me if I could come and help and get them back on track and just renew the values and the core and the culture that this school was founded on.

01:46:13.472 --> 01:46:15.014
And that's what I came to do.

01:46:15.255 --> 01:46:20.024
And since we got through that hurdle, you will see that we have been increasing.

01:46:20.084 --> 01:46:21.667
We haven't declined in our scores.

01:46:22.047 --> 01:46:23.630
We've been increasing in our scores.

01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:25.373
And I'm going to show you how.

01:46:27.576 --> 01:46:28.997
Angie, will you say your name?

01:46:29.618 --> 01:46:30.238
Angie Sims.

01:46:30.959 --> 01:46:31.639
Sorry about that.

01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:33.361
And I'm the executive director.

01:46:33.741 --> 01:46:37.905
So historically, you would see an increase in scores from 2014-15.

01:46:38.285 --> 01:46:41.488
We dropped in 2016 when we had that tragedy.

01:46:41.568 --> 01:46:44.731
And then 2017-18, you'll see that we increased again.

01:46:45.111 --> 01:46:48.034
But we increased in all of our subgroups.

01:46:48.374 --> 01:47:05.108
We did have our students to take the AP Spanish, and we do offer AP Spanish, but it is a choice class, so if they choose to sign up for it, they can take it, but we do not prevent any student from taking any AP test that they wish to take because it betters them for college.

01:47:05.948 --> 01:47:08.951
And that was a recommendation from Mr. Brown at LACO.

01:47:13.144 --> 01:47:26.773
So I wanted to just have you guys look at the CASP scores because we had Charter Impact to pull up the demographics at our school and find out where would the bulk of our students come from, and this is why we disputed their original chart.

01:47:26.793 --> 01:47:32.956
50% of our students would otherwise be at Woodrow Wilson, and 27% would be at Franklin.

01:47:33.337 --> 01:47:38.320
If you look at Woodrow Wilson, we outperformed them in English, but they outperformed us in math.

01:47:39.100 --> 01:47:47.846
If you look at the other schools that are in green, we outperformed them across the board, and those are also schools that our students would otherwise attend.

01:47:48.226 --> 01:47:50.068
So you see that there are about five.

01:47:51.889 --> 01:48:02.676
If you also look at the data, you will see that the only school on CDE's comparison chart that is making increases every year is Leches and Academia Advance.

01:48:02.856 --> 01:48:08.080
Every other school, even that is outperforming us, is declining some up to 14 points per year.

01:48:11.112 --> 01:48:19.760
So if you look at this chart, you'll see that Franklin, where 27% of students would go, they're dropping every year.

01:48:19.780 --> 01:48:22.223
Woodrow Wilson is dropping every year.

01:48:24.082 --> 01:48:49.328
So I ask, how could those schools be better serving our students than we are if we found where the problem was, if we got over our hurdle, and if we were making increases based on LACoE's recommendations, which were to implement intervention classes, we have math and English, which were also to implement an alternative way of data and testing, which is Illuminate, which is aligned to SBAC and California Common

01:48:49.748 --> 01:48:52.871
scores a California Common Standards.

01:48:53.191 --> 01:49:05.502
We did send you a copy of our SBAC related information through the Illuminate data and you could see there that our students are actually mastering those standards.

01:49:07.248 --> 01:49:13.512
If you look at the graduation rate, we are 95% and there is only one school that is beating us.

01:49:15.893 --> 01:49:17.834
We recognize that math is our weakest link.

01:49:18.114 --> 01:49:23.898
And so based on those recommendations, we implemented the CPM courses.

01:49:24.498 --> 01:49:27.261
and the students are starting to excel in math.

01:49:27.381 --> 01:49:28.763
They are passing those standards.

01:49:28.823 --> 01:49:31.706
If you look at the Illuminate data, we can't manipulate that.

01:49:31.786 --> 01:49:43.779
That is a program where the students go on, they do the assessments, and they submit us back the percentage of students that are outscoring, outperforming in those categories.

01:49:44.259 --> 01:49:54.249
So, if you look at what we sent you, there was initial mastery on the Benchmark 1 in Illuminate of 31%, and then 68% on Benchmark 2, 54% total mastery, but in 2018, and then in 2017, there was a 43%.

01:49:54.749 --> 01:49:57.352
So, you see that it upped, the mastery upped.

01:50:06.921 --> 01:50:16.314
Also, in the honors class, you'll see that we have upped our mastery from starting at 78% at the first benchmark to 85%, which was a 2% increase from 2017.

01:50:22.522 --> 01:50:38.554
ELA is not our weakest area, but we do understand that there are some deficiencies, so we put together an English intervention class with reading intervention, and our students are leveling up by two grade levels in one school year.

01:50:38.574 --> 01:50:45.720
And if you look also at that data, they are also mastering in their final exam, they're at a 98%.

01:50:48.102 --> 01:50:49.423
for the Common Core Standards.

01:50:50.223 --> 01:50:56.748
The retention and fluctuation, in 2016, two students enrolled after the start date.

01:50:56.888 --> 01:51:08.236
In 2017-18, four of the 11th grade students enrolled after the start date and were tested, and six were tested after the start date as 10th graders.

01:51:08.557 --> 01:51:14.281
So as you see, each year, as we're testing students, and even now this year, we have 11 new 11th graders.

01:51:16.022 --> 01:51:16.602
that enrolled.

01:51:17.023 --> 01:51:34.973
And when we're getting kids that are enrolling in March, or kids that are enrolling in February, or at the beginning of a school year, we're actually being looked upon, their test scores is what the previous school produced, not our school, because we have not had them long enough to educate them and prepare them.

01:51:34.993 --> 01:51:36.454
You can't do it in less than a year.

01:51:37.114 --> 01:51:40.457
And the reason why that's happening is because the demographics has changed.

01:51:40.797 --> 01:51:47.162
These students are being removed from their home schools for behavior infractions, and that's why you saw our suspension rate grow up.

01:51:47.462 --> 01:51:49.064
But our expulsion rate does not.

01:51:49.164 --> 01:51:50.225
We do not kick them out.

01:51:50.525 --> 01:51:52.306
We put them in programs and we help them.

01:51:52.727 --> 01:51:59.052
We have a good percentage of our students now that are enrolling have been on house arrest.

01:51:59.332 --> 01:52:00.373
They're on probation.

01:52:00.873 --> 01:52:05.457
And some will tell you, some that are here now will tell you, this is the first time they've ever been on honor roll.

01:52:05.837 --> 01:52:08.680
are felt proud of their academic experience here at our school.

01:52:10.182 --> 01:52:11.684
We do have a five-year plan.

01:52:13.306 --> 01:52:26.321
We implemented the intervention classes, the CPM math, we do ESPEC, AP, SAT, ACT exam support, we do Saturday school now, we do two practice exams and you'll see that

01:52:26.721 --> 01:52:29.463
This even started as early as last year.

01:52:29.483 --> 01:52:34.105
And again, I've just been there since the mid-year of 2016.

01:52:34.786 --> 01:52:39.268
So, we have EL support for our students.

01:52:39.649 --> 01:52:46.733
It is in our petition that they, after two years of classification, that we still monitor them, continue practice.

01:52:47.653 --> 01:52:51.815
We do track the Illuminate desk data.

01:52:52.935 --> 01:52:58.177
The teachers are trained on how to disaggregate data, but the students also are able to track their own data.

01:52:58.697 --> 01:53:02.239
In many of their classes, they have their own folders and they're able to track their progress.

01:53:02.699 --> 01:53:07.245
They have their own logins as well, so they're able to see when they're meeting their standards and when they're not.

01:53:07.665 --> 01:53:18.739
They meet with their academic advisor at least once per quarter, but as needed because there are students on IEPs or 504 plans or have some behavior issues and they need more time.

01:53:21.061 --> 01:53:23.803
So, we also have two practices and procedures.

01:53:24.283 --> 01:53:29.267
So, on the school side, we are ensuring that students are prepared for college and success.

01:53:29.307 --> 01:53:32.209
We're ensuring that all of the money and resources are well-stored.

01:53:32.269 --> 01:53:33.870
They go right into our programs.

01:53:34.230 --> 01:53:38.053
We ensure the organization is run by leaders that implement a positive culture.

01:53:38.453 --> 01:53:41.755
We ensure the terms of the charter contract are fulfilled.

01:53:42.195 --> 01:53:44.197
We ensure the organization meets the mission.

01:53:44.617 --> 01:53:49.581
and that the goals are clear and the programs are supported, evaluated, and that we are being held accountable.

01:53:50.122 --> 01:53:53.805
We are ensuring that the charter is operating legally and ethically.

01:53:53.825 --> 01:53:58.108
We are ensuring that the CPSA and the LCAP meet the needs of continuous improvement.

01:53:58.569 --> 01:54:03.193
The Board of Directors are ensuring to recruit and train its team in the capacity to govern

01:54:03.753 --> 01:54:07.696
The Board of Directors adopts and maintains proper governing policies and practices.

01:54:08.096 --> 01:54:11.859
The Board of Director policies and practices adheres to the Charter's mission.

01:54:12.279 --> 01:54:17.963
And the Board of Directors ensures to monitor Charter's policies, procedures, and practices with fidelity.

01:54:18.443 --> 01:54:20.525
I just want to leave you with a word from our students.

01:54:24.682 --> 01:54:29.265
I've attended LACHS since my freshman year, and I'm currently a senior.

01:54:29.285 --> 01:54:39.470
LACHS has been such an amazing school, and what I love about LACHS is how the teachers here are not just only educators, they're also life changers.

01:54:39.570 --> 01:54:45.153
I had assistance with my five-year plan after high school, and with that, I'll be joining the U.S.

01:54:45.233 --> 01:54:45.874
Navy.

01:54:45.954 --> 01:54:51.537
I've also been a student of the month for the Lakers, and I'm in the running for a valedictorian.

01:54:51.937 --> 01:54:56.460
I came to this school for recommendation from my cousin.

01:55:00.985 --> 01:55:04.687
And coming here, I learned that this school is all about giving chances.

01:55:04.907 --> 01:55:13.031
I went to Eaglewood High School, and I transferred because my brother had gotten enrolled to this school, LAICHS.

01:55:13.331 --> 01:55:17.113
And he had got a home visit from the director and the counselor.

01:55:17.853 --> 01:55:21.275
And when they were explaining how the school works, I had to make a decision.

01:55:21.315 --> 01:55:22.355
And I only been here for a month.

01:55:23.035 --> 01:55:24.256
And I like it.

01:55:24.496 --> 01:55:26.657
I picked up all my grades.

01:55:26.717 --> 01:55:27.337
It's getting better.

01:55:28.758 --> 01:55:30.500
All my courses, they're getting made up.

01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:32.182
My GPA is getting higher.

01:55:32.643 --> 01:55:35.926
Then I'm going to start playing basketball next year.

01:55:35.947 --> 01:55:36.968
I'm going to stay here again.

01:55:37.248 --> 01:55:40.251
I want this school to stay open because it helped me a lot.

01:55:40.832 --> 01:55:43.135
Hello, my name is Fisher Brown.

01:55:43.515 --> 01:55:44.677
Some of the fears I have had.

01:55:44.697 --> 01:55:45.217
Thank you.

01:55:55.745 --> 01:56:00.001
And now we'll hear from LA County for 10 minutes.

01:56:25.049 --> 01:56:26.731
Thank you President Hammond and board members.

01:56:27.051 --> 01:56:33.159
My name is Indra Lopez-Ciccarelli and I am the Director of the Charter School Office at the Los Angeles County Office of Education or LACO.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:43.431
After a thorough review, the LACO review team established that Los Angeles International Charter High School or LAI has not met the minimum academic criteria to be considered for renewal.

01:56:43.991 --> 01:56:54.828
The petition presents an unsound educational program, the petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program, and the petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of all required elements.

01:56:55.549 --> 01:56:58.253
Any of these findings constitute legal grounds for denial.

01:57:00.063 --> 01:57:07.306
For renewal, a charter school must demonstrate that it has met one of the academic performance criteria listed on the screen and specified in statute.

01:57:07.747 --> 01:57:11.228
Only subsection number four highlighted on the screen applies to LAI.

01:57:12.689 --> 01:57:21.013
To create a list of the public schools LAI students would otherwise have attended, LACoE uses data directly provided by the school.

01:57:21.713 --> 01:57:29.418
At the time of testing in 2018, LAI had five resident schools that comprised 89.7% of LAI's enrolled students.

01:57:30.058 --> 01:57:34.141
All other resident schools were only represented by one or two students at LAI.

01:57:35.602 --> 01:57:45.248
To create a list of similar schools of the district in which the charter is located, LACOE staff begins with a list generated by edresults.org and then works with the school to come to an agreed upon list.

01:57:45.848 --> 01:57:49.678
Schools are provided an opportunity to add or change the list if they provide a rationale.

01:57:50.119 --> 01:57:54.149
The email on the screen from our office to LAI provides the school with this information.

01:57:56.622 --> 01:58:09.025
LAI's response to LACO staff findings grossly misrepresents the LACO staff report in multiple areas, including academic performance, comparisons to resident and comparable schools, and deficiencies within the petition elements.

01:58:09.985 --> 01:58:16.447
CASP ELA results show that the school-wide percentage of students at LAI that have met or exceeded standards has declined since 2016.

01:58:18.127 --> 01:58:23.150
In 2018, LAI was outperformed by six of nine comparison schools in English language arts.

01:58:23.850 --> 01:58:30.793
The two numerically significant subgroups at LAI, Hispanic students and socioeconomically disadvantaged students, both showed declines since 2016.

01:58:31.214 --> 01:58:37.196
And for both of these subgroups, LAI was outperformed by five of nine comparison schools in 2018.

01:58:39.986 --> 01:58:54.279
Similarly, CASP math achievement has declined since 2016, resulting in LAI being outperformed by eight of nine comparison schools for math in 2018, for all students and for all numerically significant student groups.

01:58:55.260 --> 01:58:59.464
LAI's academic performance is not at least equal to its comparison schools.

01:58:59.884 --> 01:59:02.727
Therefore, the minimum criteria for renewal has not been met.

01:59:06.212 --> 01:59:19.179
In addition to analyzing the minimum academic performance criteria for renewal, the county board considered increases in pupil academic achievement for all groups of pupils served by the charter school as the most important factor in determining whether to grant a charter renewal.

01:59:19.979 --> 01:59:28.664
LAI demonstrated an overall decrease in pupil academic achievement for all groups of pupils served by the charter school when measured over the last four years of the charter term.

01:59:29.424 --> 01:59:39.153
Looking at the four-year comparison between 2015 and 2018, the overall percentage of students meeting or exceeding standards in English language arts dropped from 78% to 49%.

01:59:39.233 --> 01:59:49.722
For the socioeconomically disadvantaged student subgroup, the percentage decreased from 77% to 50%, and for the Hispanic student subgroup, the percentage decreased from 78% to 48%.

01:59:53.174 --> 01:59:59.716
In math, the overall percentage of students meeting or exceeding standards over this four-year period also decreased from 34% to 9%.

02:00:00.156 --> 02:00:11.480
The socioeconomically disadvantaged student subgroup, the percentage decreased from 34% to 9% and the percentage of Hispanic students meeting or exceeding standards between 2015 and 2018 decreased from 35% to 7%.

02:00:16.281 --> 02:00:24.124
These decreases in academic achievement for all groups of pupils served are required to be the most important factor when determining whether to grant the charter renewal.

02:00:24.644 --> 02:00:34.407
Additionally, as noted earlier, LAI does not meet the minimum academic criteria to even be considered for renewal as they did not perform at least equal to its comparison schools.

02:00:37.139 --> 02:00:42.182
Next, the review team determined that the renewal petition prevents an unsound educational program.

02:00:42.983 --> 02:00:50.527
Per the California Code of Regulations, an educational program is to be considered unsound if any one of three criteria exist.

02:00:50.948 --> 02:00:53.889
The review team determined that there is evidence for all three.

02:00:54.990 --> 02:01:03.837
The first criteria of an unsound program is a program that involves activities that would present the likelihood of physical, educational, or psychological harm to the affected pupils.

02:01:04.557 --> 02:01:15.746
The review team found that in 2016 and 2017, LAI had a suspension rate of over four times that of LA Unified, and in 2018, that increased to over 11 times the district rate.

02:01:16.346 --> 02:01:28.215
Instead of articulating a plan to address the issue, the current petition increases suspension rate goal from 3% to 6%, which is still three times higher than the average rate for all schools in LA County in 2018.

02:01:29.155 --> 02:01:37.982
The review team also found that the current student parent handbook lists 12 absences or tardies as grounds for expulsion, which is not aligned with either the petition or with current law.

02:01:38.942 --> 02:01:44.687
The second criteria of an unsound program is a program not to be likely of educational benefit to the pupils who attend.

02:01:45.347 --> 02:02:04.774
The review team performed a statistical analysis of all enrolled students and found that in 2017-18 at least 51% of LAI students would have otherwise attended a school with higher English language arts performance and at least 86.5% of LAI students would have otherwise attended a school with higher math performance.

02:02:05.834 --> 02:02:12.581
also found was that the English learners at LAI are not receiving the designated ELD instruction and monitoring required by current law.

02:02:13.662 --> 02:02:24.692
The third criteria of an unsound program is if the petition is for renewal, either the charter school has not met the standards for renewal or the charter school has not met the measurable pupil outcomes as described in its charter.

02:02:25.433 --> 02:02:27.735
The review team found that both of these are true.

02:02:28.356 --> 02:02:38.405
The school has not met the standards for renewal as previously discussed and an analysis of the measurable pupil outcomes in the current petition resulted in a determination that 17 of 20 MPOs were not met.

02:02:42.975 --> 02:02:59.103
After reviewing the LAI record of past performance in the areas of academic achievement, governance, facilities, fiscal, and business operations, as well as responses from an extensive capacity interview, it was determined by the review team that the petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the proposed program.

02:02:59.603 --> 02:03:09.528
Some of the factors considered in this finding included three years of declining college and career readiness preparedness according to the California school dashboard, such that only 25% of the class of 2018 met the standard.

02:03:12.469 --> 02:03:17.452
Standards not met for all five local indicators of the dashboard in both 2017 and 2018.

02:03:18.813 --> 02:03:22.936
Declining enrollment each and every year of the charter term from a high of 271 in 2014 to just 140 last month.

02:03:22.956 --> 02:03:24.957
A suspension rate that has increased from 0% in 2015 to 9.4% in 2018.

02:03:33.602 --> 02:03:46.228
all new board members since the previous charter term when enrollment was at its peak and a board and an administration not familiar with nor compliant with both the MOU between LAI and LACO as well as requirements of law that apply to the charter school.

02:03:48.035 --> 02:03:57.746
The review team found that 8 of 15 element descriptions are not reasonably comprehensive, 4 are reasonably comprehensive, and 3 are reasonably comprehensive with specific deficiencies.

02:03:58.647 --> 02:04:05.975
The 8 elements found not reasonably comprehensive contain substandard descriptions, outdated language, and failures to meet legal mandates.

02:04:06.676 --> 02:04:18.952
Responses to these findings by LAI, such as every EL student receives at least 20 minutes per week of designated pull-out EL instruction, further emphasize the school's lack of understanding with regards to current legal requirements.

02:04:21.564 --> 02:04:26.790
Though charter schools are meant to be autonomous, LACO staff has worked hard to give feedback and resources to the school.

02:04:27.410 --> 02:04:36.060
Many issues that are in our report such as low enrollment, EL concerns, compliance issues, and lack of rigor have been communicated several times and as far back as 2016.

02:04:39.232 --> 02:04:43.955
LACO CSO was not the only entity to recognize a need to increase academic rigor.

02:04:44.535 --> 02:04:53.560
The school's WASC visiting committee report from 2017 noted the number one school-wide critical area for follow-up as increased rigor in the classroom.

02:04:56.282 --> 02:05:00.664
The significant drop in CAS performance was shared directly with current leadership in June of 2017.

02:05:03.240 --> 02:05:10.265
And last year we again shared our concern about low academic performance on CASP as well as other concerns as shown.

02:05:11.125 --> 02:05:14.328
Every year the school was asked to create an action plan to address these issues.

02:05:15.088 --> 02:05:25.295
Many of the plans failed to address all unmet outcomes and implemented actions were not executed in a comprehensive manner in order to address underlying issues such as rigor.

02:05:27.585 --> 02:05:36.812
When the county board last approved the LAI charter in 2014, the school was in its fifth year of enrollment growth and academic success as a high-performing school with college-bound students.

02:05:37.432 --> 02:05:41.616
Since the renewal, LAI has experienced five years of enrollment and academic decline.

02:05:42.056 --> 02:05:49.481
Despite any changes to the facility noted by the petitioner, the actual capacity of the location has increased over the charter term from 432 in 2016 to 460 currently.

02:05:53.284 --> 02:06:00.689
Even though maximum occupancy increased, by 2017 enrollment had dropped to levels lower than 2009 and this year it is lower still.

02:06:01.230 --> 02:06:03.011
Academics has similarly declined.

02:06:03.491 --> 02:06:12.917
The most recent increase in ELA scores for 2018 over 2017 have not even brought the scores back to the 2016 levels, let alone to the levels achieved in 2014.

02:06:13.358 --> 02:06:16.560
And math scores have remained at an all-time low.

02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:22.244
Fewer than 1 in 10 students met the standard in math for the past two years.

02:06:25.256 --> 02:06:32.364
In conclusion, the review team established that LAI has not met the minimum academic criteria to be considered for renewal.

02:06:32.905 --> 02:06:33.225
Thank you.

02:06:37.830 --> 02:06:40.774
We're going to take public comment at this time.

02:06:42.455 --> 02:06:44.658
Are we ready for public comment?

02:06:47.079 --> 02:06:49.540
We have 20 speakers signed up for public comment.

02:06:49.860 --> 02:07:16.646
Sheila Whitley, Mike Bassler, Damian Moreno, Samuel Restrepo, Don Breaux, Darlene Hernandez, Claudia Perez, Angel Meza, Magdalena Resendiz, Zimri Garcia, Araceli Torres, Rafael Galdames, Joshua Angel, Gianna Garcia, Samuel Giochi, Jacque Franklin,

02:07:17.270 --> 02:07:22.394
Nalini Pineda, Joanna Rodriguez, Valerie Rodriguez, and Nicole Rodriguez.

02:07:22.594 --> 02:07:23.195
Please line up.

02:07:24.336 --> 02:07:27.999
And we'll just ask you to be aware that it's one minute per speaker.

02:07:28.019 --> 02:07:29.340
You'll have a little light go off.

02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:32.962
And a reminder, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:07:33.203 --> 02:07:33.543
Thank you.

02:07:35.390 --> 02:07:39.474
Hi, I'm Angela DeRamos on behalf of California Teachers Association.

02:07:40.615 --> 02:07:50.885
I'm actually a fourth, fifth, and sixth grade intervention teacher in my other life, and so I know about interventions, and when we try, when things are not working, we do something different.

02:07:51.406 --> 02:07:59.074
The whole point of a charter is to do something new and improved, and what we don't have is improved, we don't have the same, we have significant decline.

02:07:59.814 --> 02:08:06.058
If my students suddenly had a significant decline over a year or two I would not do the same.

02:08:06.078 --> 02:08:07.318
I would do something different.

02:08:08.119 --> 02:08:11.061
In that light we urge you to deny this renewal.

02:08:11.141 --> 02:08:11.501
Thank you.

02:08:17.444 --> 02:08:18.145
Greetings board.

02:08:18.885 --> 02:08:19.846
Dr. Michael Baisley.

02:08:21.306 --> 02:08:26.449
LACOE is leaving out a lot of information in which they have data for.

02:08:28.129 --> 02:08:38.416
Enrollment dropped because the landlord rewrote the lease and removed five acres of land and the capacity to enroll more students.

02:08:38.516 --> 02:08:45.721
Thus, LHS has received Prop 39 from LAUSD to have space on their campus.

02:08:47.583 --> 02:08:53.367
Please understand all that you've heard was not true.

02:08:54.039 --> 02:08:57.803
and LACO has the information.

02:08:58.184 --> 02:08:58.444
Thank you.

02:09:03.507 --> 02:09:04.847
Good morning, my name is Damian Moreno.

02:09:04.887 --> 02:09:07.028
I am the visual arts teacher at the high school.

02:09:08.349 --> 02:09:11.489
What I'd like to say is that we do have a community-based school.

02:09:11.910 --> 02:09:15.951
Our students know each other, they know the staff, and we are a very caring and loving community.

02:09:16.831 --> 02:09:20.392
There are a lot of things that aren't measurable, that aren't on the statistics.

02:09:20.752 --> 02:09:26.634
Some of the kids that we work with have a lot of anxiety issues and other things that are life goals that we try to help them achieve.

02:09:26.874 --> 02:09:28.955
So it's not just about the scores for me at least.

02:09:29.315 --> 02:09:33.537
Yes, it's important, but there is a lot more to a student's life that is important.

02:09:34.357 --> 02:09:41.019
Other than that, I would like to say that there are a lot of students in our schools that would be lost in the bigger community.

02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:44.021
And the fact that we have those students in our schools helps them out.

02:09:44.621 --> 02:09:46.962
We have students that have, like I said, anxiety.

02:09:47.022 --> 02:09:51.123
There's LGBT students that we are very fortunate to have at our school.

02:09:53.865 --> 02:09:58.813
And that population that would be lost in other schools, like I said, they help each other out.

02:09:58.873 --> 02:10:02.779
They're helping the other students become more accepting of people that are different than them as well.

02:10:03.440 --> 02:10:06.785
Other than that, I would just like to say that I hope that we could get renewed.

02:10:06.925 --> 02:10:07.106
Thank you.

02:10:10.794 --> 02:10:13.095
Good morning board members, my name is Samuel Estrepo.

02:10:13.615 --> 02:10:15.276
I'm a chemistry teacher at Laches.

02:10:16.116 --> 02:10:26.761
This is the first year that I've had a school with a facility to actually supply the materials that I need to actually even teach an AP chemistry class, which isn't being taught, but I have all the materials possible in order to be able to do that.

02:10:27.041 --> 02:10:29.922
That's one of the first schools that I've ever been teaching for 12 years.

02:10:30.662 --> 02:10:31.883
And I actually followed Ms.

02:10:31.903 --> 02:10:36.845
Sims from where we used to teach at together as both teachers until she became director.

02:10:37.665 --> 02:10:39.586
And I followed her because I believed in her.

02:10:40.207 --> 02:10:42.969
I saw her strength in her teaching capabilities.

02:10:43.329 --> 02:10:46.030
I saw her strength in her relationship buildings with the students.

02:10:46.691 --> 02:10:48.212
I saw her strength in willing to fight.

02:10:49.112 --> 02:10:59.278
I think you see that in her, and I hope that that takes your decision making rolling forward with the momentum that we do have in order to renew our charter.

02:10:59.379 --> 02:10:59.799
Thank you, guys.

02:11:06.454 --> 02:11:07.795
Good morning, my name is Ron Breaux.

02:11:08.856 --> 02:11:12.378
I've worked at small county schools, large unified schools, and public charter schools.

02:11:13.399 --> 02:11:16.001
I came on to this public charter school with Ms.

02:11:16.021 --> 02:11:27.408
Sims a couple years ago, and while we're not perfect, we have an infrastructure in place that will help to improve our culture, improve our test scores, and our community.

02:11:28.292 --> 02:11:35.855
We have a group of staff that are in place that are willing to work with our staff and work with our students to build up these scores if we're given a chance.

02:11:36.836 --> 02:11:43.859
We also have a community of students that are in need of us who are willing and able and have the structure to work with them.

02:11:44.599 --> 02:11:46.600
But we need to have the ability to work with these students.

02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:54.647
Some of these students would be, I don't know where since they've come from other places, sent away from other places or just wander from other places.

02:11:54.988 --> 02:11:57.791
But they come to us where they are and we meet them where they are.

02:11:58.151 --> 02:11:59.953
So I build them to where they can be.

02:12:00.733 --> 02:12:07.900
But we just need the chance to put this infrastructure and these things we have in place to build our community through our family atmosphere that we have at our school.

02:12:08.701 --> 02:12:09.982
And we just need that chance.

02:12:10.263 --> 02:12:10.543
Thank you.

02:12:13.683 --> 02:12:14.908
Good morning, board members.

02:12:14.948 --> 02:12:15.912
My name is Angel Meza.

02:12:16.474 --> 02:12:19.325
This is our daughter's first year at Leach's.

02:12:20.103 --> 02:12:24.344
And we want to let you know that this is the only school that we have available in the neighborhood.

02:12:26.404 --> 02:12:29.565
We need a place where the kids can actually excel.

02:12:29.665 --> 02:12:35.506
My daughter came with low grades and she is now current or above the level that she needs to be.

02:12:35.526 --> 02:12:47.649
I need you guys to know that in the amount of time that Miss Simms has been at the school, going from the disastrous level that she took the school at, she's actually

02:12:49.029 --> 02:12:50.210
made it grow, made it bloom.

02:12:50.230 --> 02:12:52.430
A lot of the students have no place else to go.

02:12:53.171 --> 02:12:54.671
And I think Ms.

02:12:54.691 --> 02:12:56.692
Simms deserves the chance.

02:12:57.332 --> 02:12:59.593
She deserves this charter to be renewed.

02:13:00.053 --> 02:13:05.075
And if you give her that chance, she'll show you that she is a champion, she's a warrior, and she'll turn the school around.

02:13:05.455 --> 02:13:05.715
Thank you.

02:13:11.711 --> 02:13:12.432
Hi, good morning.

02:13:12.532 --> 02:13:15.574
My name is Darlene Hernandez, and I'm the college and career counselor.

02:13:16.175 --> 02:13:26.043
In my two years, I have seen an influx of students enrolling as 10th and 11th graders, as special education students, as students that were failing and are in fear that they would not graduate.

02:13:26.463 --> 02:13:30.206
Many of them enrolling as late as the last two to three months of school.

02:13:30.647 --> 02:13:34.149
This week alone, we welcome an 11th and 12th grade student.

02:13:34.490 --> 02:13:37.092
We now also have two students that are in foster youth.

02:13:37.512 --> 02:13:41.715
Here at Leches, and as students share all the time, we are a second chance school.

02:13:42.155 --> 02:13:52.421
We are the home for six students on academic probation and or house arrest, but are now coming to school daily and are even placing honor roll for the first time in their academic career.

02:13:52.881 --> 02:14:01.386
We are an institution of hope and even when with the struggles of the SBAC performance, it cannot be denied that we are graduating and sending our students to college.

02:14:02.947 --> 02:14:06.131
If approved by the state, we promise that Latres will make you proud.

02:14:06.511 --> 02:14:08.313
I'm from the community of Highland Park.

02:14:08.353 --> 02:14:09.575
I went to Franklin High School.

02:14:09.955 --> 02:14:13.919
Comparing a public school to a charter, you know the difference?

02:14:13.939 --> 02:14:14.340
Thank you.

02:14:20.270 --> 02:14:24.271
Good morning board members my name is Claudia Perez I am the current board president.

02:14:25.372 --> 02:14:36.155
LACL's findings state that we have an unsound educational program based on our independent studies program and middle school program yet the independent study and the middle school programs are both material revisions.

02:14:36.655 --> 02:14:40.076
They have made determinations based on the programs that have yet to be implemented.

02:14:40.536 --> 02:14:45.898
We hope you will ask clarifying questions as LACL has reported information that is untrue.

02:14:46.358 --> 02:14:47.598
I'm a parent there.

02:14:47.759 --> 02:14:50.639
I have a child who is autistic and is excelling.

02:14:50.699 --> 02:14:52.320
He's taking his AP exam this week.

02:14:52.680 --> 02:14:54.001
I'm also an alumni parent.

02:14:54.061 --> 02:15:01.483
My daughter graduated in 2014 and the situation where the school was at that time compared to how it is now is such a difference.

02:15:01.863 --> 02:15:03.424
There's so many more opportunities.

02:15:03.444 --> 02:15:04.644
There's so many more classes.

02:15:04.844 --> 02:15:12.246
It gives them the ability to go and really seek out careers and be more business oriented or artistic.

02:15:12.406 --> 02:15:13.407
I have a child who

02:15:14.167 --> 02:15:22.393
didn't want to go to college and now he's graduating in a month and he's so excited and enrolled himself and already picked his class time and stuff.

02:15:22.454 --> 02:15:22.734
Thank you.

02:15:28.291 --> 02:15:36.840
Good morning, my name is Magdalena Resendiz and I'm currently a senior at Los Angeles International Charter High School.

02:15:38.302 --> 02:15:48.253
When I first came to Leach's I transferred my second semester of freshman year because I started at a private high school, but at the private high school I didn't belong, my grades were good but I wasn't passing.

02:15:48.593 --> 02:15:53.119
When I first transferred to Laches, I felt like instantly I felt that connection with the community.

02:15:53.159 --> 02:16:03.872
There was everyone helping me and after along the lines, yes, I had my issues and I struggled a lot academically, but I'm the first in my family to have applied to like four universities and got accepted to all of them.

02:16:04.292 --> 02:16:07.493
I'm the first to have received executive honor roll.

02:16:07.553 --> 02:16:18.936
I am so proud of everything I have accomplished, but that is because of my teachers, how much they've had one-on-one time with me, how much they've helped me, how much I've had grown because of this school, how much my friends have been in this family.

02:16:19.316 --> 02:16:27.679
It's more than just teachers at a school, it's a community, it is a family, and I really hope you guys give everyone else that chance that I had to experience this school.

02:16:28.179 --> 02:16:28.479
Thank you.

02:16:35.455 --> 02:16:40.037
Good morning my name is Zimmer Garcia I'm currently a senior at Los Angeles International Charter High School.

02:16:40.817 --> 02:16:44.819
These past four years I spent at this school have been beyond what I imagined.

02:16:46.299 --> 02:16:54.922
At first when I finished eighth grade and when my parents decided to send me to this school at first I was a little bit reluctant because it was a school that I had never heard of.

02:16:55.383 --> 02:16:57.043
It was in an area that I had never heard of.

02:16:57.663 --> 02:17:02.005
I didn't know anybody over there I would have to start new and right now to this day

02:17:03.134 --> 02:17:07.077
When I look back at these past four years, they have been nothing but great memories, great people.

02:17:08.518 --> 02:17:10.800
All the teachers we've had over the years, they've all been wonderful.

02:17:12.081 --> 02:17:15.764
They take their time, and they talk to you.

02:17:16.364 --> 02:17:17.305
You can talk to them.

02:17:17.425 --> 02:17:18.185
They're a friend.

02:17:18.306 --> 02:17:19.446
They're like family to you.

02:17:20.187 --> 02:17:28.373
And it's just something wonderful that I feel like other schools do not have, that they are so close to their students and how they are willing to go so far for them.

02:17:28.954 --> 02:17:32.116
And it's just something very important to me when it comes to a high school experience.

02:17:32.830 --> 02:17:36.852
So I hope that you could take this and get this.

02:17:37.452 --> 02:17:37.712
Thank you.

02:17:42.034 --> 02:17:43.135
I'm just going to interject.

02:17:43.175 --> 02:17:45.196
We appreciate that you appreciate each other.

02:17:45.216 --> 02:17:51.698
But traditionally, we ask that there not be any clapping or noise from the audience.

02:17:51.778 --> 02:17:56.180
So you can maybe be silent in your appreciation.

02:17:56.841 --> 02:17:57.221
Thank you.

02:17:59.383 --> 02:18:01.084
Hello my name is Araceli Torres.

02:18:01.905 --> 02:18:04.726
I am a junior currently and like Ms.

02:18:04.746 --> 02:18:08.188
Moreno said I am a student that is a part of the LGBT community.

02:18:08.568 --> 02:18:13.751
I'm also a student with disabilities and I am a student with anxiety so this is kind of nerve wracking to be up here.

02:18:14.272 --> 02:18:27.680
But this school has definitely increased my confidence in coming up here and I want it to be that not only for myself but other kids amongst our community to have this.

02:18:29.048 --> 02:18:41.156
We're not we understand that OK our epidemics do need improvement but I think we are a clear representation that each student isn't meant for a cookie cutter.

02:18:42.277 --> 02:18:48.821
They understand that and they have molded each individual student to where they are at and how to increase it.

02:18:49.601 --> 02:18:51.082
And I think with that.

02:18:52.276 --> 02:19:02.261
that they themselves have been in and out, for me personally, one-on-one, when I need it, how I need it, they're always there, time.

02:19:02.281 --> 02:19:04.482
So thank you for your time.

02:19:09.698 --> 02:19:10.118
Good morning.

02:19:10.338 --> 02:19:11.759
My name is Joshua Angel.

02:19:12.499 --> 02:19:13.579
I'm a senior at LAI.

02:19:14.319 --> 02:19:19.641
And I just want to say that I'm very thankful for Laches and the opportunities that they provided for me.

02:19:19.661 --> 02:19:26.763
There's a lot of things that have happened in my life that could have really thrown me off track.

02:19:27.183 --> 02:19:34.325
And I'm very proud to say that I was accepted into my dream schools thanks to the school.

02:19:35.746 --> 02:19:48.644
how they guided me throughout these four years and I hope that you could renew the school so that other students could have the same experience and you know go to the places where they want to be because that's very rare where we live.

02:19:49.545 --> 02:19:49.806
Thank you.

02:19:57.162 --> 02:20:24.646
Good morning my name is Rafael Gómez I have been attending LHS for four years I'm currently a senior and throughout the years I've been at LHS I've seen a few changes in myself as well where I personally would never talk to teachers simply because it's not a you know not a student to student type of relationship but I slowly noticed that I've been talking to a few of my teachers such as Mr. Restrepo and Mr. Moreno I'm able to communicate with them such as

02:20:25.286 --> 02:20:26.547
as if they were my own peers.

02:20:27.247 --> 02:20:28.148
Same with Miss Sims.

02:20:28.928 --> 02:20:33.831
I feel very comfortable being able to talk to them about grades or anything related to that matter.

02:20:34.751 --> 02:20:40.634
And with this information, I'm hoping that you guys are able to take this into reconsideration.

02:20:41.015 --> 02:20:41.315
Thank you.

02:20:47.221 --> 02:21:07.911
Good morning I'm Gianna Garcia and I'm also a senior and I've attended Lake Chisholm since I was a freshman and going into high school I wasn't prepared for high school or even college and I was like I didn't feel like comfortable but like I grew to be comfortable I like had challenges and stuff but like the teachers and the staff really supported me like Ms.

02:21:07.931 --> 02:21:12.614
Hernandez like she'll make time for us if we need help with like our college admissions or any

02:21:13.414 --> 02:21:14.115
anything like that.

02:21:14.135 --> 02:21:21.560
So I'm just, I'm grateful that I went to this school and that I got accepted to the colleges that I applied to.

02:21:21.580 --> 02:21:32.827
Oh, hello.

02:21:32.887 --> 02:21:34.328
My name is Sam Yogi Showy.

02:21:34.348 --> 02:21:35.489
I am a sophomore.

02:21:36.503 --> 02:21:38.464
And I currently attend Laches High School.

02:21:40.505 --> 02:21:46.788
Back in 2018, I had just moved from my house to Highland Park area.

02:21:46.968 --> 02:21:49.109
And I really didn't know schools out here.

02:21:50.149 --> 02:21:53.471
And my auntie found this school, Laches High School.

02:21:53.591 --> 02:21:55.212
And I didn't know too much about it.

02:21:55.592 --> 02:21:57.893
And I didn't really know anybody there.

02:21:57.913 --> 02:21:58.833
I knew one person.

02:22:00.695 --> 02:22:04.760
At my old school, the teachers, they really didn't care about me.

02:22:04.780 --> 02:22:10.927
They didn't care about my grades, academics, and they just wanted me to be in class every day.

02:22:10.987 --> 02:22:13.590
But at LHS, they actually helped me.

02:22:13.630 --> 02:22:17.274
They'll go one-on-one basically with me, Mr. Moreno, Ms.

02:22:17.294 --> 02:22:17.675
Shield.

02:22:18.155 --> 02:22:18.916
They always helped me.

02:22:19.897 --> 02:22:21.958
for anything I need and I could really talk to them.

02:22:22.138 --> 02:22:25.960
And I made many, many good friends and bonds.

02:22:26.300 --> 02:22:30.442
And I'm currently an AB student and I'm an O school, I was a CMD student.

02:22:31.103 --> 02:22:33.924
So I just want to thank Laches for helping me without that.

02:22:34.204 --> 02:22:34.884
And- Time.

02:22:35.525 --> 02:22:35.845
Thank you.

02:22:36.085 --> 02:22:36.285
Thank you.

02:22:45.855 --> 02:22:47.055
My name is Jaquay Franklin.

02:22:48.696 --> 02:22:50.798
I'm currently an 11th grader at Laches.

02:22:51.378 --> 02:22:59.984
I came from Englewood High School and I had just moved to Highland Park and I had to wake up at 5 o'clock in the morning every day to go to school.

02:23:00.764 --> 02:23:05.009
It was a two-hour bus ride, and I got tired of it.

02:23:05.529 --> 02:23:07.271
Coming back home, I'd get tired.

02:23:07.331 --> 02:23:08.492
I wasn't able to do homework.

02:23:09.333 --> 02:23:13.117
I couldn't really focus in class, so I had to make a decision.

02:23:13.698 --> 02:23:14.358
Ms.

02:23:15.359 --> 02:23:15.920
Sims and Ms.

02:23:15.960 --> 02:23:21.526
Hernandez came to my house, and they offered me a chance so I could be able to do better.

02:23:23.968 --> 02:23:35.414
I had different possibilities at this school, so I made a decision, and I came to Laches, and since I've been here, the school's just been family towards me.

02:23:35.734 --> 02:23:36.515
I met a lot of friends.

02:23:37.255 --> 02:23:46.980
I just hope that other students can be able to see that, that Laches is a good school, and that you all can be able to see that.

02:23:57.937 --> 02:23:58.698
My name is Nalini.

02:23:59.579 --> 02:24:00.199
I'm a senior.

02:24:00.719 --> 02:24:02.421
I transferred from a Catholic school.

02:24:03.221 --> 02:24:06.324
And I wasn't really doing good my freshman year.

02:24:06.904 --> 02:24:08.466
And then I transferred to Laches.

02:24:08.786 --> 02:24:12.029
And I did so well that I'm in honor roll now.

02:24:12.929 --> 02:24:18.234
And I showed my parents that, you know, they could trust in me and they have faith in me that I will graduate.

02:24:18.454 --> 02:24:21.376
And I will be joining the police academy once I graduate.

02:24:21.997 --> 02:24:25.119
So I hope you help us.

02:24:25.620 --> 02:24:26.100
And thank you.

02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:33.801
Hi, good morning.

02:24:33.941 --> 02:24:34.942
I'm Joanna Rodriguez.

02:24:35.062 --> 02:24:38.305
I'm a parent of a senior and a freshman there at Leches.

02:24:38.725 --> 02:24:41.087
My senior began there when she was a freshman.

02:24:42.889 --> 02:24:47.352
At that time, the administration running the school made me kind of not have confidence in the school.

02:24:47.372 --> 02:24:48.814
I was thinking of transferring her out.

02:24:49.654 --> 02:24:49.815
Ms.

02:24:49.855 --> 02:24:52.497
Sims came in and made a complete change.

02:24:53.647 --> 02:24:56.970
She has brought upon a culture where the kids feel safe.

02:24:57.750 --> 02:25:04.936
We are aware that maybe test taking doesn't really show what the kids are capable of, or are not great at test taking.

02:25:06.938 --> 02:25:10.301
But she has set a culture there where everybody feels comfortable.

02:25:10.321 --> 02:25:12.943
Our mental health is a priority.

02:25:13.103 --> 02:25:16.025
If you're not all set here, it's hard for you to go to school and focus.

02:25:16.626 --> 02:25:17.847
It's an open door policy there.

02:25:17.947 --> 02:25:19.468
Everybody feels comfortable talking to her.

02:25:20.789 --> 02:25:28.353
I have so much confidence in this school that I am really here to plead that you keep it open because I do have a son who will be coming in from LAUSD with an IEP.

02:25:28.373 --> 02:25:30.695
He has ADHD, ODD.

02:25:30.715 --> 02:25:33.236
I've been struggling for many years.

02:25:33.296 --> 02:25:35.477
I'm his biggest advocate, go to all the IEP meetings.

02:25:42.071 --> 02:25:51.359
Good afternoon board members my name is Valerie Rodriguez and I am a senior who has had the privilege to have been a student at Los Angeles international charter high school for all my four years.

02:25:52.360 --> 02:26:00.487
I admit at the first sight of LAI I was very hesitant and dreaded that I was forced to enroll because of the small campus and uniforms.

02:26:01.427 --> 02:26:05.589
But now I can confidently say that I wouldn't have wanted to go to school anywhere else.

02:26:06.230 --> 02:26:11.973
I am a part of the softball team, student government, and I'm enrolled in advanced placement classes.

02:26:12.973 --> 02:26:16.255
I grew many friendships and became a part of a family outside of my own.

02:26:16.775 --> 02:26:23.519
Academically over the years, the school has improved through testing due to the teachers who put so much effort to get us college ready.

02:26:24.079 --> 02:26:27.903
Unfortunately, I scored low on my testing, but it didn't stop me.

02:26:27.923 --> 02:26:33.049
I have been accepted and will be attending a four-year college this upcoming school year in Arizona.

02:26:34.370 --> 02:26:37.614
In addition, they have offered me two scholarships to attend the university.

02:26:39.055 --> 02:26:45.062
It would be very disappointing if Lechas had to close its doors to the community because other people deserve an opportunity like we had.

02:26:45.202 --> 02:26:45.442
Time.

02:26:45.782 --> 02:26:46.043
Thank you.

02:26:53.908 --> 02:26:58.630
Hello, my name is Zecor Rodriguez and I am currently a freshman at LAI.

02:27:01.251 --> 02:27:12.296
When I first got to this school I was very scared because I knew nobody and for the first three weeks I had no friends because I would hang out with my sister and her friends.

02:27:13.316 --> 02:27:13.796
So sad.

02:27:16.894 --> 02:27:25.160
But I joined the volleyball team, which helped me break out of my shell and get more friends and be comfortable around everybody.

02:27:26.120 --> 02:27:31.944
So with that, I joined the basketball team, then the softball team.

02:27:32.544 --> 02:27:37.448
I was the only freshman on the volleyball and basketball team, so I was very proud of that.

02:27:37.468 --> 02:27:41.530
I have anxiety, so I'm shaking right now.

02:27:41.570 --> 02:27:41.971
I'm sorry.

02:27:43.672 --> 02:27:46.654
My brother will be attending if the school

02:27:47.595 --> 02:28:00.309
stays open next year and I know he will be better and appreciate the school like I do and I'm very thankful for everybody there, the teachers, the students, the staff.

02:28:00.889 --> 02:28:01.270
Thank you.

02:28:04.386 --> 02:28:11.389
And I assume that's the end of the public commenters, so I'm gonna, at this point, close the public hearing.

02:28:12.070 --> 02:28:14.371
We're now ready for board member discussion.

02:28:14.411 --> 02:28:17.872
I'm gonna turn to Sue Burr, our liaison, to get us going.

02:28:19.634 --> 02:28:25.459
So I think you can see from the agenda item that the advisory commission did not take action.

02:28:25.499 --> 02:28:27.861
They were unable to reach a conclusion about this.

02:28:28.021 --> 02:28:40.172
But it's safe to say that many of the members of the ACCS were quite moved by the testimony, especially by students and community members and parents on behalf of the school.

02:28:41.573 --> 02:28:45.095
I'll just say for me I think it's quite a unique school.

02:28:45.776 --> 02:29:09.374
I would like to just take a point of personal privilege and read the intent language of the Charter Schools Act and it says that charter schools are established for a variety of reasons but two of them are to increase learning opportunities for all pupils with special emphasis on expanded learning experiences for pupils who are identified as academically low achieving.

02:29:10.294 --> 02:29:19.688
And secondly, that it's to provide parents and pupils with expanded choices in the types of educational opportunities that are available within the public school system.

02:29:20.268 --> 02:29:25.295
And I think you see in this school, both of those provisions are firmly in place.

02:29:26.678 --> 02:29:30.123
So, with that said, I would like to ask Ms.

02:29:30.163 --> 02:29:39.880
Sims if she could come back up and ask some specific questions, answer some specific questions, and then I'd like to hear from other members before we talk about a motion.

02:29:41.437 --> 02:29:43.199
I think there may be other questions for Ms.

02:29:43.239 --> 02:29:48.844
Sims, so after you finish your questions, we'll see before she sits down what other ones there may be.

02:29:48.864 --> 02:29:50.305
Morning.

02:29:50.345 --> 02:29:50.785
Thank you, Ms.

02:29:50.825 --> 02:29:51.606
Burr, for calling me up.

02:29:51.706 --> 02:29:51.926
Sure.

02:29:51.966 --> 02:29:57.011
Thank you for coming, and I should also express our appreciation to everyone who came.

02:29:57.071 --> 02:29:59.273
I know many of you drove all night to get here.

02:29:59.873 --> 02:30:03.515
Yes, they're AP testing too, so a lot had to stay behind today.

02:30:04.315 --> 02:30:09.417
So just know how appreciative we are of the passion that you feel for this school.

02:30:10.797 --> 02:30:25.163
I think you kind of glossed over a very traumatic event that happened at the school, and I'd like you to talk a little bit about that, because to me, having looked at a lot of data on test scores, when you see something happen and there's clearly sort of a marker and things go bad,

02:30:26.143 --> 02:30:31.447
Something happened there that I'd like you to share and then I'll come back to another couple questions.

02:30:31.467 --> 02:30:37.170
And it's difficult for me to share because I'm coming from Compton Unified myself.

02:30:37.270 --> 02:30:53.560
I'm an inner city student where my science teacher said the best you can hope for as a minority African American student is that you graduate from high school and become the manager at a fast food restaurant.

02:30:54.207 --> 02:31:00.089
So I'm emotional about them because they're me.

02:31:01.230 --> 02:31:02.490
They're students that struggle.

02:31:03.171 --> 02:31:04.871
They're students that have been in trouble.

02:31:05.672 --> 02:31:07.893
They are students whose parents need support.

02:31:09.493 --> 02:31:11.794
They're students that need to feel safe.

02:31:12.615 --> 02:31:15.036
And if 50% of them are coming from the school that

02:31:15.936 --> 02:31:18.478
trying to send them back to, they're not gonna be safe.

02:31:19.319 --> 02:31:31.788
And this experience was traumatic for me even to hear about it because I remember a student being killed at Dominguez High when I taught there, when I taught in Compton.

02:31:32.449 --> 02:31:38.453
And basically it was the day that LAUSD had the bomb threat and they sent all the school's kids home.

02:31:39.114 --> 02:31:42.336
And he was crossing the street on Figueroa and was hit by an 18-wheeler.

02:31:42.997 --> 02:31:44.878
And when your children see that,

02:31:45.939 --> 02:31:49.602
how do you expect that they're able to really function?

02:31:50.703 --> 02:32:03.912
So they experienced that and then that same month, their entire executive director, their entire leadership board and the board of directors were gone.

02:32:05.313 --> 02:32:14.440
And they went through three directors in just that one year and finally got to me and I was very hesitant about coming because I knew the school was in trouble.

02:32:15.675 --> 02:32:19.340
And I also knew that two years wasn't enough time to turn it around.

02:32:20.101 --> 02:32:31.657
But since I came, I have adhered to what LACOE has asked of me, implementing the courses for intervention.

02:32:32.137 --> 02:32:35.118
implementing the CPM, the academic rigor.

02:32:35.158 --> 02:32:37.078
We have 11 new elective courses.

02:32:37.458 --> 02:32:42.919
The reason why our kids are not having the behavior issues they were having before is because now they have dance and yoga.

02:32:43.319 --> 02:32:44.840
They're exerting a lot of energy.

02:32:45.780 --> 02:32:48.841
We have students with autism taking AP classes.

02:32:49.281 --> 02:32:51.081
They couldn't do that at their other schools.

02:32:51.441 --> 02:32:52.221
And they're on honor roll.

02:32:52.742 --> 02:32:55.802
So we tried to take that tragedy and turn it around.

02:32:56.302 --> 02:32:58.283
And the first step in that is

02:32:59.543 --> 02:33:02.906
is giving them a safe place to heal, and does healing happen overnight?

02:33:02.946 --> 02:33:03.607
It doesn't.

02:33:04.488 --> 02:33:05.008
It doesn't.

02:33:05.669 --> 02:33:10.293
But they're scared, and they don't want to go back to these places that they've been abused or mistreated.

02:33:10.774 --> 02:33:19.262
So we are getting a lot of students that are enrolling in the 10th and the 11th grade that we have not had time to fully prepare, but we're dedicated to that.

02:33:21.312 --> 02:33:32.135
And I feel like, honestly, the guidance that we were given is now being used against us, because we've done what we were asked to do, but we need time to show.

02:33:33.836 --> 02:33:35.076
But these kids are showing you.

02:33:35.516 --> 02:33:38.077
Last year, 38 students graduated.

02:33:38.097 --> 02:33:43.519
36 were accepted to a four-year university, despite not doing well on their SBAC.

02:33:44.139 --> 02:33:51.861
because they soared in every other area, and they were able to use their alternative data that we weren't able to use in our petition.

02:33:52.562 --> 02:33:54.962
And so that's the reason why we're here today.

02:33:56.163 --> 02:33:56.563
Thank you.

02:33:56.663 --> 02:33:58.903
I really appreciate it, and I appreciate your emotion.

02:33:58.923 --> 02:33:59.844
And I apologize.

02:33:59.864 --> 02:34:00.824
That's OK.

02:34:01.364 --> 02:34:01.704
I really do.

02:34:01.764 --> 02:34:03.125
I feel exactly the same way you do.

02:34:05.226 --> 02:34:09.308
Can I just ask a couple specific questions then related to some of the things that we heard?

02:34:09.808 --> 02:34:12.309
What is the WASC status of the school?

02:34:12.570 --> 02:34:14.511
We got a full six-year accreditation.

02:34:15.171 --> 02:34:26.537
What we were told was for the rigorous, if you even, and I could forward the email, our chairperson said we put that in every school's report because every school can improve academics.

02:34:27.418 --> 02:34:40.671
And what we are advising is that you do some type of an intervention or you guys start implementing Saturday Academies, which we do now, we have Saturday Academy, and they said put AVID in the school.

02:34:42.733 --> 02:34:45.215
I'll stop now and see if other people have questions.

02:34:45.436 --> 02:34:45.796
Thank you.

02:34:46.036 --> 02:34:46.577
Thank you, Ms.

02:34:46.597 --> 02:34:46.717
Burr.

02:34:47.341 --> 02:34:48.924
Have some for you as well.

02:34:48.984 --> 02:34:51.327
Are there others who have questions for Ms.

02:34:51.347 --> 02:34:51.588
Sims?

02:34:51.668 --> 02:34:56.876
Okay, Ting, and then we'll go around to Patricia and Eileen, and then I'll come in the queue.

02:34:58.137 --> 02:34:58.517
Thank you.

02:34:59.798 --> 02:35:00.939
Sorry, I'm getting emotional.

02:35:00.959 --> 02:35:01.760
I'm sorry.

02:35:01.940 --> 02:35:03.502
No, no, no, it's OK.

02:35:03.582 --> 02:35:12.509
So yeah, one of the questions I had was the WASC accreditation, because I think that also helps to flesh out a little bit about the culture of the school that we don't necessarily see in quantitative data.

02:35:14.091 --> 02:35:15.972
So a couple of other things.

02:35:16.233 --> 02:35:22.258
Can you just tell me the number of 11th graders you have and the number of 12th graders you have?

02:35:24.174 --> 02:35:26.200
11th graders right now we have 41 and 12th graders is 48.

02:35:29.324 --> 02:35:34.446
Okay, so I'm looking at your, I mean, it's 153 students in the school, very small school.

02:35:34.526 --> 02:35:40.268
So when we're looking at this data too, we know that one or two students makes a huge difference in the percentages.

02:35:40.288 --> 02:35:50.872
And then when you get down to 41 students in a class, especially when we're looking at high school and there is the CAFs, it's for that one 11th grade only.

02:35:51.332 --> 02:35:53.013
So some of the fluctuations.

02:35:53.293 --> 02:35:57.175
And so I see the test scores,

02:35:58.976 --> 02:36:02.199
One of the pieces of charter law is academic achievement.

02:36:02.739 --> 02:36:10.226
At the same time, you're also serving, as you pointed out, students who may not have been achieving in other schools, and you're providing that.

02:36:11.286 --> 02:36:18.212
I will also say from my experience, and I think one of the reasons I got emotional is because I know that, excuse me,

02:36:19.213 --> 02:36:26.321
In a small school, when you have a really close community, when a death occurs, it does really impact.

02:36:26.681 --> 02:36:29.924
And that happened to one of my academies where a

02:36:31.616 --> 02:36:37.700
a teacher passed away and our test scores tanked in math that year.

02:36:38.280 --> 02:36:42.362
And I completely understand and empathize with that.

02:36:42.502 --> 02:36:51.168
And then it does take several years to try to tune that up again, especially when in high school, again, you're only tested that one grade level.

02:36:51.448 --> 02:36:54.430
So, sorry.

02:36:54.450 --> 02:36:56.030
I feel the same way.

02:36:58.223 --> 02:36:58.623
Thank you.

02:37:00.224 --> 02:37:01.225
I got napkins here.

02:37:01.245 --> 02:37:09.209
I think that it's important to note that the report saying that we decline in scores every year is not true.

02:37:09.369 --> 02:37:11.931
If you look at the data yourself, you'll see we plummeted.

02:37:11.971 --> 02:37:13.152
We did hit rock bottom.

02:37:13.512 --> 02:37:17.954
But we put those things in place, and every year our test scores actually were raising.

02:37:18.815 --> 02:37:19.515
We increased.

02:37:20.076 --> 02:37:22.337
We didn't decrease every year after we hit the bottom.

02:37:23.257 --> 02:37:25.058
But we hit the bottom, and we realized that.

02:37:25.078 --> 02:37:31.240
And we also take fault for not updating the dashboard.

02:37:31.660 --> 02:37:33.501
But we were in crisis.

02:37:33.521 --> 02:37:34.641
We were in survival mode.

02:37:35.561 --> 02:37:42.184
And we were trying to ensure that our kids didn't drop out, and that they didn't

02:37:43.424 --> 02:37:50.409
that they receive the counseling they need, that they receive the support they need, and that we are the only high school in the city of Hermann.

02:37:50.849 --> 02:37:53.211
We actually sit in Hermann, not Highland Park.

02:37:53.872 --> 02:37:55.212
And we are the only high school there.

02:37:55.292 --> 02:37:59.055
And we petitioned for the middle school because the nearest one is three miles away.

02:37:59.715 --> 02:38:00.916
And that is why we got the Prop 39.

02:38:02.117 --> 02:38:05.438
And parents were asking, well, can we get a middle school here?

02:38:05.798 --> 02:38:08.078
And we got that Prop 39 to bring that middle school.

02:38:08.438 --> 02:38:12.999
If we have these kids from sixth grade, imagine what they'll be doing on their tests in the 11th grade.

02:38:13.479 --> 02:38:27.042
But if we're getting them as 10th and 11th graders because their district schools are putting them out, are turning their backs on them, or their parents are saying this is their last chance before they drop out, they have no place else to go, and we're taking them.

02:38:27.883 --> 02:38:29.223
But they're not back in the system.

02:38:30.123 --> 02:38:30.803
They're in school.

02:38:31.243 --> 02:38:34.364
So do we close down their school and then they just don't go?

02:38:35.245 --> 02:38:38.426
Because a lot of the kids are saying they won't go if they can't be here and be safe.

02:38:40.307 --> 02:38:42.927
So just last two points that I have.

02:38:44.008 --> 02:38:55.912
One is I appreciate the number of opportunities you provide, especially with such a small high school of 153, the AP classes, the sports, and some of the other things that we're hearing from the students.

02:38:56.392 --> 02:39:04.994
And lastly, I just really wanna praise the students who came today and how articulate they were and very passionate about their school.

02:39:05.034 --> 02:39:11.335
We hear a lot of students who are passionate about our school, but it was very clear from them that how they benefited from their experience at the school.

02:39:11.616 --> 02:39:12.136
So thank you.

02:39:12.536 --> 02:39:12.916
Thank you.

02:39:17.157 --> 02:39:17.777
Good morning, Ms.

02:39:17.837 --> 02:39:18.077
Rucker.

02:39:18.359 --> 02:39:18.879
Good morning.

02:39:18.899 --> 02:39:25.544
Well, first of all, I want to congratulate you all for making it here because I know you had a lot of drama with the travel up here.

02:39:25.584 --> 02:39:27.445
Two plane flights were canceled.

02:39:27.545 --> 02:39:41.015
And I actually appreciate that you were able to be here today rather than facing the drama of coming back for another scheduled hearing because it would not have felt good, especially for the students who are making the effort to get here.

02:39:42.055 --> 02:39:43.757
for the young men and women who are here today.

02:39:43.797 --> 02:39:48.723
I really want to tell you how much I appreciate the effort and initiative you showed to get here.

02:39:49.343 --> 02:39:59.735
My questions are about the information provided by the department staff and also by the county office concerning what they identified

02:40:00.275 --> 02:40:02.136
as deficiencies in the program.

02:40:02.176 --> 02:40:17.926
And in asking these questions, let me begin by saying, I believe I agree with you that you're being held accountable for guidance that you're trying to address, and that it seems like that guidance that you've been given are some things that are being held.

02:40:18.026 --> 02:40:22.869
I think I agree with you on that, but I do wanna ask some specific questions.

02:40:23.490 --> 02:40:28.553
So in your petition, you are proposing to add some additional grade levels?

02:40:29.093 --> 02:40:31.715
We wanted to start with sixth grade next year.

02:40:31.815 --> 02:40:42.661
We do, I believe you have in your red folders, several hundred signatures from the community because parents were saying that what they're finding they're having trouble is

02:40:43.570 --> 02:40:45.231
if they have to be at work at 8 a.m.

02:40:45.771 --> 02:40:52.755
and they have to bring a kid to high school over here and to a middle school three miles away, it was posing difficulties for them.

02:40:53.335 --> 02:41:09.324
And we also understood that after in 2016, this was after I got to the school, when they did reduce the lease, the size of the amount of land that we could use, that we were going to need to have more space in order to grow the program.

02:41:09.944 --> 02:41:18.653
So, we did ask LAUSD for Prop 39 and it was granted to us so that we would be able to start those programs.

02:41:18.973 --> 02:41:25.880
We do have students that are enrolled tentatively if there is going to be a middle school.

02:41:26.520 --> 02:41:30.544
And we realized that the school needs to overcome some obstacles.

02:41:30.644 --> 02:41:39.031
So we were just surprised that maybe the middle school and the IS program would have been denied but the high school would still continue.

02:41:39.611 --> 02:41:50.880
That's kind of what we felt would happen because we knew that at the time we thought the alternative data and the performance and that our kids are going to UC Davis.

02:41:51.801 --> 02:41:53.902
They're being accepted to USC and UCLA.

02:41:53.922 --> 02:41:56.763
They're not being accepted there because they're not performing.

02:41:57.523 --> 02:42:03.706
And we did implement, as they asked us to, we implemented the honors program in every grade level.

02:42:03.746 --> 02:42:06.187
So now even ninth graders are taking honors courses.

02:42:06.567 --> 02:42:08.667
So we're not doing the same thing over and over.

02:42:08.908 --> 02:42:14.630
As was stated, we are implementing something every single year to improve the students' performance.

02:42:15.030 --> 02:42:20.192
OK, so the answer to my question about whether or not you're adding another grade

02:42:20.773 --> 02:42:23.147
Oh yes, yes, we would like to add a grade.

02:42:25.086 --> 02:42:28.968
Yeah, so the answer is yes, that's what your petition's asking for.

02:42:29.828 --> 02:42:53.500
This goes back to, for my colleagues on the dais, why I said in the previous hearing that I'm a little confused about what it is we're attempting to do in these conversations because given what you have stated and the conversations and the information that's been presented by students as well as by you and members of your team, your faculty,

02:42:54.020 --> 02:43:04.745
and staff about the trauma that has gone on with the school, particularly with the upheaval in leadership and some of the work that you clearly know you have to overcome.

02:43:05.425 --> 02:43:16.130
I'm not sure I understand how expanding the school with everything else that you actually need to address actually will accomplish

02:43:16.610 --> 02:43:20.393
what you believe can be accomplished given everything that you have to work on.

02:43:20.413 --> 02:43:30.800
So I have a concern that your petition, if it's approved, would add more grade levels, more complexity to the work that you already have to address.

02:43:30.860 --> 02:43:40.827
And I don't see how adding that grade level in what you've written in the petition actually clearly addresses the problems that you agree are there.

02:43:41.627 --> 02:43:48.455
The second question I have is about the things that have been identified that your educational program doesn't address.

02:43:48.936 --> 02:43:54.082
Can you tell me some things about how you're going to fix your EL plan?

02:43:54.142 --> 02:43:59.188
And I need you in answering the question not to tell me what you've done,

02:43:59.768 --> 02:44:02.549
and not to explain to me what your outcomes have been.

02:44:02.569 --> 02:44:17.953
This says that you don't have a clear description on your plan for serving ELs and that it doesn't appear to cite the correct assessments that are required and you do not have a clear plan for reclassification.

02:44:17.973 --> 02:44:26.616
So I need you to explain to me how exactly, and I know you're the third director, but what exactly is the work that you have done

02:44:27.176 --> 02:44:32.560
that you have put your hands on to direct your staff to do to address this concern?

02:44:33.560 --> 02:44:41.806
So we have an EL coordinator, and the EL coordinator is pulling the students and testing with the students at least 20 minutes per week.

02:44:42.066 --> 02:44:50.231
We also put all of the EL students into that intervention group, which again was a recommendation from LEGO.

02:44:50.872 --> 02:44:56.856
And so when the students reclassify, we continue to follow them.

02:44:57.436 --> 02:45:05.820
The period that we will follow for would be two years, but if the student, let's say they reclassify in 10th grade, they're out in two years.

02:45:06.121 --> 02:45:09.702
If they reclassify in ninth, we still will provide them the services.

02:45:10.263 --> 02:45:14.665
And we did state that in our meeting with LACOE when we did the capacity hearing.

02:45:15.165 --> 02:45:20.187
Okay, so that's not clear to me in the written material that I have read through.

02:45:20.207 --> 02:45:33.874
Do you have any, and it's okay on this next question to answer no, do you have any idea of how many long-term English learners, because you have high school students, do you have any idea how many long-term English learners are in your student population?

02:45:34.594 --> 02:45:38.035
We only have four students that are EL in our school.

02:45:39.976 --> 02:45:46.098
We don't have a huge EL population and we've never had a huge EL population.

02:45:46.878 --> 02:45:51.180
I believe last year we had about 11 and six were reclassified.

02:45:51.580 --> 02:45:56.501
So we just, one did move on because she graduated.

02:45:56.581 --> 02:46:00.943
So right now we do only have about four students that are in the program.

02:46:02.083 --> 02:46:05.725
But they're also being able to be seen in the tutoring program as well.

02:46:06.225 --> 02:46:10.928
So they go into the tutoring program and then the doors are open for Saturday school for them as well.

02:46:11.248 --> 02:46:13.489
But they do want to one also with their counselor.

02:46:14.029 --> 02:46:17.771
Okay, so then as it relates to for those four students.

02:46:18.211 --> 02:46:20.633
that you know are long-term English learners.

02:46:21.194 --> 02:46:22.975
They're not long-term, though.

02:46:23.376 --> 02:46:25.277
Those kids will reclassify this year.

02:46:27.339 --> 02:46:35.306
They get the EO classification if Spanish is their first language or another language is their first language.

02:46:36.107 --> 02:46:41.672
These students are, they're scoring at the reclassification level every time we test them.

02:46:42.212 --> 02:46:55.143
But those that are currently in the program, we monitor them through assessments, through the Reading Plus program, because the Reading Plus program gives us the data to show so the kids will read for a certain amount of time.

02:46:55.183 --> 02:46:56.204
They answer the questions.

02:46:56.544 --> 02:46:57.865
It is all data-based.

02:46:57.925 --> 02:46:59.547
It is nothing that the school prepares.

02:47:00.447 --> 02:47:09.573
The program gives us back the reports, and it's showing that those students are leveling up by two grade levels in a year.

02:47:09.933 --> 02:47:15.216
So just to put some perspective, we do have two students that transferred to our school.

02:47:15.256 --> 02:47:23.000
They're international students that transferred to our school, and they are now reading above the ninth grade level through that program.

02:47:23.701 --> 02:47:24.902
So we are tracking them.

02:47:25.922 --> 02:47:28.103
Okay, that wasn't the question I was going to ask.

02:47:28.143 --> 02:47:29.424
Let me ask you the question.

02:47:29.905 --> 02:47:43.993
So for the four students you told me that you are tracking as long-term English learners, what exactly is in the plan based on the guidance that you're telling me you've been working to address from LACO?

02:47:44.233 --> 02:47:53.199
What is the integrated and designated English language development program that you have for those students, for those four students?

02:47:53.519 --> 02:48:01.121
Well, based on the guidance from LACOE, now mind you too that we just changed coordinators.

02:48:01.261 --> 02:48:03.102
I understand, I understand all of that.

02:48:03.122 --> 02:48:09.443
Okay, so based on the previous guidance, we put together the intervention classes for them.

02:48:09.823 --> 02:48:13.785
This was part of the plan for developing the EL students.

02:48:13.885 --> 02:48:19.026
It was through tutoring, through testing, through monitoring, through their intervention class.

02:48:19.746 --> 02:48:28.556
And they are taking the, they do take the silt and we do get- The alpac.

02:48:28.877 --> 02:48:30.218
I'm sorry, the alpac, yes.

02:48:30.459 --> 02:48:34.203
I have all this in my head and it's just- I got it, I got it.

02:48:34.803 --> 02:48:36.724
So that's why I said, I know you mean the LPAC.

02:48:37.105 --> 02:48:38.225
They do take the LPAC.

02:48:38.685 --> 02:48:43.908
And so we're tracking them based on performance, so we just reassess and reevaluate them.

02:48:44.269 --> 02:48:53.013
But outside of the reclassification, we reassess and reevaluate them each month that we give them an assessment.

02:48:53.053 --> 02:48:59.257
So they have their formal assessments and they have their informal assessments, and they do those with the EL coordinator.

02:48:59.577 --> 02:49:00.718
So she has tracking sheets.

02:49:00.758 --> 02:49:04.019
So every student that's in the EL program has a tracking sheet.

02:49:04.079 --> 02:49:09.341
It shows where they started with their comprehension, with their reading skill and their reading level.

02:49:09.642 --> 02:49:12.503
And then it tracks how much they're progressing.

02:49:12.823 --> 02:49:18.746
So we give each student almost like an IEP, a goal for progression and a goal for when

02:49:19.526 --> 02:49:26.731
we feel like they've reached that progression, then they're able to, you know, yearly we test for reclassification.

02:49:27.492 --> 02:49:32.275
But every time that there, if there is a student that doesn't reclassify, then they get the interventions.

02:49:32.635 --> 02:49:36.077
They get more of the interventions that we had put in place.

02:49:36.738 --> 02:49:43.742
The thing on the EL plan, it did say Casey, and that was the outdated test.

02:49:43.862 --> 02:49:48.906
We just, we missed that when we edited, we missed bringing that out.

02:49:49.546 --> 02:49:50.586
But we acknowledge that.

02:49:51.327 --> 02:49:54.668
Look, like most of the people in this room, I have a clippings file.

02:49:54.728 --> 02:49:57.349
I get an article sent to me from newspapers all the time.

02:49:57.389 --> 02:49:58.889
And I'm a high school English teacher.

02:49:58.909 --> 02:50:04.731
It drives me nuts when I read an article that's been published and somebody got paid really good money for it and there's typos in it.

02:50:05.051 --> 02:50:06.772
So I understand the typos stuff.

02:50:07.252 --> 02:50:08.773
But here's the issue.

02:50:09.293 --> 02:50:18.176
Some of the things I just ask you to articulate to me to address the criteria about an integrated and designated English language development plan

02:50:18.636 --> 02:50:28.342
While you touched on some of the things that would be required in the plan, you do understand you didn't explain all of those things.

02:50:28.442 --> 02:50:33.525
But further, the point that's being made by what LACO has written in their report

02:50:34.485 --> 02:50:36.387
making the recommendation to deny.

02:50:36.827 --> 02:50:48.815
And the report that was written by the department staff on making their recommendation to deny is that none of what you've explained to me is clearly articulated in your plan.

02:50:49.195 --> 02:50:51.337
So while you may be busy doing a lot of things,

02:50:54.659 --> 02:50:57.980
The question is, are you doing the correct things?

02:50:58.580 --> 02:51:18.207
And how do we know that if it's not apparent in the core of what is supposed to be your defining plan, not only to address the guidance and the concerns that have been expressed to you by LACO, but what will clearly continue to be continuing concerns by this board and the department

02:51:18.747 --> 02:51:23.632
if you don't know how to write that out and address all that criteria.

02:51:24.372 --> 02:51:30.137
And I apologize that our EO coordinator isn't here either to give you all the ins and outs.

02:51:30.218 --> 02:51:34.301
And I'll be honest with you, as the director, there's so much that I do.

02:51:34.341 --> 02:51:36.103
I don't have everything memorized.

02:51:36.503 --> 02:51:45.810
I'm looking at the plan in my head, though, but she's doing AP testing right now, and we had to decide that she had to stay back.

02:51:46.610 --> 02:51:57.298
But like I said, we do acknowledge that there are some things that we have to address, and we do acknowledge that there are some things that probably possibly has to be rewritten.

02:51:58.079 --> 02:51:58.939
Not probably.

02:51:59.540 --> 02:52:00.800
That will have to be rewritten.

02:52:01.641 --> 02:52:03.982
We understand that and we acknowledge that and we're ready for it.

02:52:04.002 --> 02:52:06.724
I have to tell you, I'm concerned that you said probably.

02:52:06.764 --> 02:52:11.166
That tells me you're resistant to even the recommendations or the guidance that's been given.

02:52:11.186 --> 02:52:11.526
Not at all.

02:52:11.546 --> 02:52:12.427
I have a concern.

02:52:12.747 --> 02:52:13.667
It's not a probably.

02:52:13.707 --> 02:52:18.370
There are some things that definitely have to be corrected and addressed in your plan.

02:52:18.550 --> 02:52:20.511
We need to move on to the next set of questions.

02:52:20.551 --> 02:52:21.752
Yes, I agree with you as well.

02:52:22.572 --> 02:52:25.854
Elaine, you're next, and then Felice, and then I'll put myself a little further.

02:52:25.874 --> 02:52:34.680
So first, let me just thank you all for, all the students for coming, all the staff for coming, and for the continued commitment to this population and the group of students.

02:52:35.640 --> 02:52:39.963
I'm clear that this is a, it's a small, but it's a safe environment.

02:52:40.003 --> 02:52:45.847
It's an environment that students have gone to after not feeling safe and successful in other locations.

02:52:46.187 --> 02:52:49.988
I know the area of Los Angeles, and I also want to thank L.A.

02:52:50.028 --> 02:52:54.329
County and the Department of Ed for their analysis, and also thank L.A.

02:52:54.389 --> 02:52:57.229
County for their oversight and their support.

02:52:57.269 --> 02:52:59.270
So I have several questions about the process.

02:52:59.870 --> 02:53:02.830
The way I understand it, this was a school that's been around 10 years.

02:53:02.930 --> 02:53:07.971
It was authorized by LAUSD, and LAUSD authorized it.

02:53:08.131 --> 02:53:09.352
On the renewal, they denied.

02:53:09.512 --> 02:53:10.272
So L.A.

02:53:10.332 --> 02:53:11.012
County heard it.

02:53:11.592 --> 02:53:13.593
They authorized it for five years.

02:53:13.913 --> 02:53:15.593
Oversight now denied.

02:53:16.133 --> 02:53:17.214
now coming to us.

02:53:17.294 --> 02:53:19.735
So this is not a brand new school with a year or two.

02:53:20.135 --> 02:53:26.699
It's gone through cycles and having led schools, I know schools go through cycles, but I have several questions.

02:53:27.639 --> 02:53:39.706
First of all, as far as the suspension rate, it's my understanding if students are suspended in a school and they transfer to a different site, the suspensions go with them on the tracking if it's during that school year.

02:53:40.226 --> 02:53:41.147
I believe that.

02:53:42.108 --> 02:53:47.171
So that's one issue I've heard actually from continuation high schools who take students from traditional high schools.

02:53:47.652 --> 02:53:53.596
So I know you said that you didn't believe the suspension rate was reflective of what practices actually occur at your school.

02:53:54.036 --> 02:54:06.245
And I just am aware of that in other sites and I'll just set that one aside because I do know that if students have been suspended at other schools during the school year and the kids transfer to you, we don't lose that record.

02:54:06.866 --> 02:54:07.987
I just want to make that comment.

02:54:09.168 --> 02:54:17.795
But I do want to talk to you as the executive director about how you wrote your plan, because I have several questions about the plan, and that's under which we have to evaluate.

02:54:18.176 --> 02:54:21.999
So what was the process that you went through to write the petition for renewal?

02:54:22.519 --> 02:54:25.142
As the executive director, it's a small school, small team.

02:54:25.322 --> 02:54:27.444
How did you go around about that process?

02:54:28.545 --> 02:54:30.766
Well, initially I had a different coordinator.

02:54:31.307 --> 02:54:40.675
So I was basing off the recommendations of LACOE, the recommendations of WASC, and my conversations with my previous coordinator.

02:54:41.876 --> 02:54:55.468
I had asked, I think it was at the end of the, at the beginning of the 2017 school year, if I could make a materials revision for the independent studies program because options for youth was closing down.

02:54:56.269 --> 02:55:02.476
80 students would otherwise have gone to Franklin and that school was across the street from us.

02:55:03.037 --> 02:55:11.928
So I was told no to put that, that I would be able to put that into this because we were too close to renewal.

02:55:12.729 --> 02:55:17.331
So, I went off of that recommendation and that's why it was in this plan.

02:55:18.151 --> 02:55:34.678
Once this petition was written, then I received a text message from the new coordinator that said LACOE doesn't believe that we should include it, but it was already written and ready for submission based on the old recommendation that it should go in as a materials revision.

02:55:35.138 --> 02:55:36.699
So, that's how that got in that plan.

02:55:37.159 --> 02:55:39.441
But basically, I looked at our LCAP, too.

02:55:39.941 --> 02:55:41.162
I looked at our CPSA.

02:55:41.622 --> 02:55:47.746
And I looked at deeper than just what the test scores were reporting.

02:55:49.167 --> 02:55:58.893
Through the SSC, the School Site Council, things had come up that we needed to ensure that the kids had culture, there was safety, and things like that.

02:55:59.314 --> 02:56:03.696
And our discipline policy is written into that plan.

02:56:04.657 --> 02:56:05.498
But I will tell you this.

02:56:07.219 --> 02:56:17.605
I was told these words, your plan had been approved before, so basically you're just adding your new stuff to your plan.

02:56:17.965 --> 02:56:22.047
And so that's what, I'm sorry, but that's what we did.

02:56:22.127 --> 02:56:24.229
So we went back and adjusted the things that

02:56:25.029 --> 02:56:39.822
that we understood the laws have changed on this, the laws have changed here, the student needs have changed, so we adjusted those and then we kept the core of what the petition was because it's based on the mission.

02:56:39.842 --> 02:56:48.090
So let me just say, I have no doubt that your leadership has provided a safe and secure environment and a renewed opportunity and vision for the school.

02:56:49.191 --> 02:56:53.775
The problem is that the analysis says that 8 of the 15 requirements are not met.

02:56:53.895 --> 02:57:01.923
And while you just adjusted, if we evaluate just that charter petition, it has API, it has Casey, it has SELT.

02:57:01.963 --> 02:57:05.607
Those are things we don't do at the state anymore and haven't for a while.

02:57:06.127 --> 02:57:12.154
And so I'm wondering whether it was just like, since it was, I'm just asking and I'm just wondering.

02:57:12.814 --> 02:57:15.958
If it was approved before, we'll just do the same thing, but things have changed.

02:57:16.018 --> 02:57:22.625
And so the concern and kind of building on what Member Rucker said is we expect English language development to be taught in a little different way.

02:57:22.645 --> 02:57:26.108
I think WASC and asking you for rigor is important.

02:57:26.148 --> 02:57:27.570
We want that in all of our schools.

02:57:27.990 --> 02:57:29.951
And I guess I'm hearing from L.A.

02:57:30.031 --> 02:57:35.013
County that they actually gave you recommendations and you're saying we've done what L.A.

02:57:35.053 --> 02:57:37.134
County told us to do to get better and yet L.A.

02:57:37.194 --> 02:57:41.035
County and their analysis said you didn't follow the recommendations.

02:57:41.075 --> 02:57:45.877
And I think they did appear to exercise oversight and support.

02:57:45.977 --> 02:57:54.581
So can you talk about that tension about how the direction to improve with their year authorizer, you're asking for us to now authorize,

02:57:55.081 --> 02:58:01.623
They authorized you to supervise, and then you did or didn't do what they recommended you needed to do.

02:58:02.563 --> 02:58:02.844
But Ms.

02:58:02.864 --> 02:58:03.544
Strauss, we did.

02:58:03.564 --> 02:58:11.706
The recommendation was that we implement, the direct recommendation was CPM math, and we did that.

02:58:11.786 --> 02:58:12.607
We did that in 2017.

02:58:13.887 --> 02:58:15.588
Intervention classes, we did that.

02:58:16.008 --> 02:58:18.629
Inside of our classes, though, we used,

02:58:20.029 --> 02:58:42.323
some of the Sadai strategies, we scaffold, we do all of that so it's not just the EL students that are progressing, that it's all students that are getting access to these strategies and the thinking maps and just all of the things that are creating a clearer thinker and helping them to be more organized and to better comprehend and read and understand.

02:58:42.603 --> 02:58:45.445
So we use also some of our

02:58:46.285 --> 02:58:59.431
strategies that are written in our IEPs, we use those directly in our classrooms as well because it is a catcher's mitt for some of those students that really haven't been identified that are transferring in at such a late stage.

02:58:59.691 --> 02:59:06.494
But I will tell you, I questioned about when we wrote the petition because

02:59:07.234 --> 02:59:21.538
It did say API on there as a criteria, and I even said, but we don't do that anymore, so how do I write that I've met this goal if this is what we're supposed to write to and it doesn't even exist?

02:59:21.898 --> 02:59:23.518
So I was told, but you can't change that.

02:59:23.878 --> 02:59:24.979
That is what's written, so.

02:59:26.219 --> 02:59:34.603
I didn't go back and extract it out of the EL plan, and I should have, and I take ownership for that, and that's why I'm saying I do know, Ms.

02:59:34.643 --> 02:59:46.948
Rucker, there are things that we have to fix, but I think that my confusion came from so many different voices because of the different coordinators telling me different things.

02:59:47.148 --> 02:59:47.929
I have one more question.

02:59:47.969 --> 02:59:51.953
I just so appreciate you sincerely trying to address the questions, honestly.

02:59:51.973 --> 02:59:56.518
And I'm just trying to understand the pieces that we are required to evaluate.

02:59:56.538 --> 02:59:57.379
So that's why I'm asking.

02:59:57.680 --> 03:00:05.548
There was a question about your employee qualifications, and I just would like you to address what you know about the problem in that area.

03:00:06.369 --> 03:00:28.205
Well, the question that was asked to us in the capacity hearing was, why does our operations manager have athletic knowledge and CIF knowledge on the employee qualifications list when you look at the employment, I'm sorry, job description?

03:00:28.465 --> 03:00:30.125
Job description, I'm sorry, I drew a blank.

03:00:31.045 --> 03:00:42.688
And that is because if you look at our organization chart, which is in our charter petition, which Letco has a copy of, the operations manager is the direct supervisor to our athletic director.

03:00:43.148 --> 03:00:54.710
So she has to know, because she's paying those bills, she's authorizing, well, they come to me, but she authorizes the checks for if we're paying CIF fees,

03:00:56.690 --> 03:00:57.930
What are the CIF fees?

03:00:57.970 --> 03:01:02.952
Are we being overcharged when there's referees and things like that?

03:01:02.972 --> 03:01:04.552
So she has to know it.

03:01:04.993 --> 03:01:06.613
Is it just about the athletic piece?

03:01:07.333 --> 03:01:07.553
No.

03:01:07.713 --> 03:01:13.495
So we have a teacher who has a CTE credential that teaches our dancing yoga program.

03:01:13.995 --> 03:01:18.037
She's on the CTE credential through LACO.

03:01:18.757 --> 03:01:22.118
When she joined the program, and what we were originally told,

03:01:22.498 --> 03:01:25.661
was that when she clears it, she will receive her EO authorization.

03:01:26.021 --> 03:01:31.807
But it wasn't until we got our new coordinator that stated, no, she needs an EO waiver.

03:01:32.167 --> 03:01:34.129
So we did apply for that EO waiver.

03:01:34.489 --> 03:01:37.492
They do have the documentation that that has been applied for.

03:01:38.072 --> 03:01:42.757
Also, when we went back to check, we had her to check to make sure that the authorization had come through.

03:01:43.317 --> 03:01:45.239
They had it coded as something else.

03:01:45.339 --> 03:01:50.562
So we sent a letter to CTC and we let them know that this is not what we applied for.

03:01:50.642 --> 03:01:53.845
We gave them a copy and they said that they are looking into it now for us.

03:01:53.865 --> 03:01:55.846
So do you believe it's just that one staff member?

03:01:55.926 --> 03:01:58.508
Do you believe that's the only issue on the qualifications?

03:01:58.548 --> 03:01:59.168
I'm just asking.

03:01:59.989 --> 03:02:03.692
Yes, it is, because every other teacher is completely qualified.

03:02:03.732 --> 03:02:18.483
But I will tell you this, we were misdirected because I received an email from the new coordinator that our environmental science teacher was not properly credentialed.

03:02:19.023 --> 03:02:20.023
So I disputed that.

03:02:20.083 --> 03:02:26.085
I told him that he was properly credentialed and these were his credentials and this is why he could teach the science.

03:02:26.545 --> 03:02:30.587
He told me that he needed a biological science or a life science credential.

03:02:31.087 --> 03:02:34.188
First of all, he's a chemistry teacher teaching environmental science.

03:02:34.868 --> 03:02:37.369
So he wouldn't get a biological science credential.

03:02:37.869 --> 03:02:42.110
Secondly, in 2015, life science credentials become obsolete.

03:02:42.450 --> 03:02:45.051
So I could not understand why we were being told that.

03:02:45.231 --> 03:02:47.812
I really appreciate your thoroughness.

03:02:47.852 --> 03:02:49.073
I know we have some other questions.

03:02:49.633 --> 03:02:50.293
So I thank you.

03:02:50.474 --> 03:02:53.935
I just want to ask LACO because they're the ones that did the announcement.

03:02:55.016 --> 03:02:55.256
Okay.

03:02:55.336 --> 03:02:55.456
Okay.

03:02:55.496 --> 03:02:55.876
That's fine.

03:02:56.276 --> 03:02:56.536
All right.

03:02:56.776 --> 03:02:57.697
That's all the rest of it.

03:02:58.837 --> 03:02:59.098
Okay.

03:03:00.378 --> 03:03:02.039
Do you have any more questions?

03:03:24.008 --> 03:03:47.855
Wonderful Voices of your students and the work that you've done over the last couple of years and there have been increases posted in ELA and math since 2016 that was obvious on the charts and your graduation rates are very high and obviously you're getting kids into college There's a lot of good work going on there Yeah, I wanted to ask

03:03:51.538 --> 03:04:00.725
The other two questions, I think we got a little bit of insight perhaps from board member Strauss about the suspension rates being so high.

03:04:01.966 --> 03:04:13.695
Maybe some of that is being carried with the students from other schools, but I want to ask you about what you're doing in that area to provide alternatives to suspension so that we can hear your response to that.

03:04:13.955 --> 03:04:31.443
So, one of the things that we started implementing was the one-to-one counseling with the students that are coming in with the behavior issues, because like our counselor explained, we have students, maybe about 7% of our population, that are juvenile delinquent.

03:04:32.183 --> 03:04:44.194
And I wish we had more time because in one of the clips and the thing, you would have heard the student tell their story and how he would have gone to jail if LHS didn't accept him.

03:04:45.134 --> 03:04:56.324
So we're seeing an influx of students that are coming in from other schools, the neighboring schools that they would otherwise attend, that they are no longer being allowed to be in school there.

03:04:56.624 --> 03:04:57.545
And they're coming to us.

03:04:57.885 --> 03:04:59.107
We've not expelled them.

03:05:00.748 --> 03:05:04.193
We have put together a counseling program for them.

03:05:05.675 --> 03:05:14.908
We also work one-to-one with their probation officers, and I'm very heavily involved in that because, like I said, I was an inner-city student, so I know the importance of that.

03:05:15.329 --> 03:05:16.671
And then also, we pull them.

03:05:17.171 --> 03:05:19.073
So, we pull them, we monitor, and we track.

03:05:19.193 --> 03:05:29.364
Every two weeks, we're looking at their grades, and we give them a progression plan that may include grade and behavior, because not all of these students are part of the IEP program.

03:05:29.825 --> 03:05:36.231
But we still, as one of the students said, every single student, we meet their needs individually.

03:05:36.632 --> 03:05:38.213
And those are some of the things that we're doing.

03:05:38.954 --> 03:05:42.976
Some of the behavior that we did see, yes, some of the suspensions do come with them.

03:05:43.276 --> 03:05:46.658
But some of the behaviors we were seeing was drugs, drug abuse.

03:05:47.198 --> 03:05:54.561
And so I actually called LACO because I was questioning the suspension.

03:05:55.082 --> 03:05:58.383
And I was told directly, but you have to do what's listed in your charter.

03:05:58.743 --> 03:06:01.685
And your charter petition says, if there's drugs on campus,

03:06:03.407 --> 03:06:06.150
the suspension was part of that policy.

03:06:06.991 --> 03:06:15.060
We've written in the PBIS, we've been going to the PBIS training, and our students are now no longer having those issues.

03:06:15.120 --> 03:06:16.782
If you look at our suspension rate this year,

03:06:17.822 --> 03:06:18.342
It's not.

03:06:18.622 --> 03:06:19.063
They're not.

03:06:19.163 --> 03:06:27.365
And we're not having those types of problems because we did implement that one-to-one counseling with the students, but not only with the students, with the parents.

03:06:27.805 --> 03:06:35.648
So the students and the parents are coming in, and they're getting sessions, and we make plans for all of them and goals, and they're on a tracking system.

03:06:35.928 --> 03:06:37.968
So now we're not seeing those behavior issues.

03:06:38.028 --> 03:06:39.809
We just had to get over that hump.

03:06:40.609 --> 03:06:48.595
But you can't expect there not to be behavior issues when you're getting kids from a juvenile system that wants to test the waters and see what they can get away with.

03:06:49.055 --> 03:06:51.236
But that was the reason why we saw that increase.

03:06:52.077 --> 03:06:52.477
Thank you.

03:06:53.638 --> 03:06:57.821
And you already mentioned that with respect to math, you've been putting in place the CPM math.

03:06:58.341 --> 03:07:03.325
And I just wondered if you have, you mentioned with respect to math and improvement, excuse me.

03:07:04.606 --> 03:07:07.849
With respect to math, you're seeing improvements in math?

03:07:08.269 --> 03:07:12.893
Can you say what more you're doing beyond the CPM program?

03:07:13.013 --> 03:07:24.424
We also have math intervention, and we have our ELs that are taking that class, our special education students, and we do allow our lowest performing 11th graders into that class.

03:07:24.924 --> 03:07:29.128
Again, we're now doing SBAC practices two a year.

03:07:29.488 --> 03:07:36.115
So the students since last year have been taking SBAC practice and AP practice and SAT practice twice a year.

03:07:36.195 --> 03:07:37.536
So one in each semester.

03:07:37.856 --> 03:07:41.239
And we're doing our Saturday academies to address our math issue.

03:07:42.581 --> 03:07:45.764
But we also have, we're also doing supplementals.

03:07:46.204 --> 03:07:50.087
So we're fusing math into the other subjects.

03:07:50.428 --> 03:07:53.971
They do this cross-curricular project where they start in the ninth grade.

03:07:54.551 --> 03:08:00.437
The ninth grade, 10th, 11th, and 12th graders do it across the board, and they're doing it throughout their classes.

03:08:00.497 --> 03:08:05.201
So it's a huge math problem, but you'll see it happening in art, history, English.

03:08:05.521 --> 03:08:11.863
So we're attacking math in every place that we can because we know that that was our greatest problem.

03:08:14.264 --> 03:08:15.524
Matt, you are next.

03:08:15.744 --> 03:08:21.646
I do want to be able to move us to the county office soon, but if you have a quick question and I saw Kim, go ahead.

03:08:23.790 --> 03:08:28.452
Well, I, morning, I won't be, I'll be brief and it's just a clarifying question.

03:08:30.493 --> 03:08:31.874
Actually a question and clarifying question.

03:08:32.454 --> 03:08:34.595
Students with disabilities, are you part of a SELPA?

03:08:34.715 --> 03:08:35.395
Who's monitoring?

03:08:35.475 --> 03:08:36.056
Southwest.

03:08:36.416 --> 03:08:36.876
Southwest.

03:08:36.976 --> 03:08:47.701
Yes, and we have been great on all of our audits and our observations and through the monitoring through Southwest, we are compliant, completely compliant.

03:08:49.157 --> 03:09:01.843
So I want to make sure I understand your position because our fellow board members have been great about asking some really great questions and I just want to thank you, number one, for standing here and taking it all.

03:09:01.943 --> 03:09:05.084
It's not easy and I want to thank your students and your community for coming.

03:09:05.625 --> 03:09:08.326
They definitely love you and you're obviously a passionate leader.

03:09:09.186 --> 03:09:10.868
So there are two issues in my mind.

03:09:11.409 --> 03:09:13.991
One is the scores, the comparison scores.

03:09:14.612 --> 03:09:22.560
And we can debate those scores back and forth for a long time in terms of how you compare yourself to other schools versus how LACO.

03:09:23.021 --> 03:09:24.903
The other issue that I think is creating the most

03:09:26.524 --> 03:09:31.288
The most questions, and I want to make sure I understand your position, is the errors in the petition.

03:09:31.848 --> 03:09:41.135
So the errors in the petition in terms of what LACOA deems as competency, the ability of the school to move the system forward, and there's some confidence issues.

03:09:41.716 --> 03:09:44.498
But it doesn't seem like you gave LACOA much choice.

03:09:44.978 --> 03:09:46.700
The petition had errors.

03:09:46.960 --> 03:09:50.663
But what I hear you saying is many of those errors were based on the guidance of LACOA.

03:09:51.403 --> 03:10:01.366
Yes, so we had a different coordinator, and then in October, we had a different coordinator.

03:10:01.386 --> 03:10:07.369
And when you're trying to abide by what LACOE is telling you, but then it's different,

03:10:08.809 --> 03:10:26.147
I went and met with them in October, and I sat down with Ciccarelli and Mr. Hartman, and I did tell them that there are discrepancies, and I showed it, in what I was told and what I'm being told now, and I don't know where to go with this.

03:10:26.307 --> 03:10:28.349
What improvements do you own in this?

03:10:29.540 --> 03:10:30.441
I'm sorry, say that one more time.

03:10:30.461 --> 03:10:31.681
What improvements do you own?

03:10:32.142 --> 03:10:35.904
So in other words, yeah, there's some guidance barriers related.

03:10:35.964 --> 03:10:43.849
We need continued professional development, and that was one of the things that was in our plan.

03:10:45.610 --> 03:10:47.972
We also, we're not, we're not,

03:10:48.792 --> 03:11:10.346
that much different than the students, we kind of need to know that our authorizers are supporting us too, and that just because we're questioning them, that we don't feel like we're under attack, and which is what we felt like, because we were kind of reprimanded for going to the CTC behind their back, so to speak, but that wasn't it.

03:11:10.426 --> 03:11:16.790
I just kind of wanted to clarify that whole credential thing, and kind of got a reprimand for not just doing it through LACO.

03:11:17.910 --> 03:11:25.474
But our previous coordinator said, when in doubt, go to the state, ask the state.

03:11:25.794 --> 03:11:26.694
And that's what we did.

03:11:27.495 --> 03:11:39.040
But where I take ownership is that I know that this petition has errors that need to be addressed and rewritten.

03:11:39.701 --> 03:11:42.522
I understand that.

03:11:42.542 --> 03:11:44.243
I also understand that

03:11:46.912 --> 03:12:00.290
We need to address and find where we can improve these students and we really need to catch the transfers because it is the transfer students that are struggling.

03:12:00.550 --> 03:12:02.833
It is not the ones that we've had in our school.

03:12:03.454 --> 03:12:09.500
So we know that we have to find a way to address our transfer students.

03:12:10.100 --> 03:12:11.682
I'll put this into perspective too.

03:12:11.762 --> 03:12:17.727
This year, 12% of the students testing this year are transfer students and SPED students.

03:12:17.747 --> 03:12:18.708
6% are SPED.

03:12:20.089 --> 03:12:29.072
But we have a lot of those students that have been with us, so we've been tracking them, making sure that they're going to be able to take this test and pass this test.

03:12:29.452 --> 03:12:32.393
So with the petition, the errors, I take ownership.

03:12:32.473 --> 03:12:33.093
I'm the director.

03:12:33.634 --> 03:12:34.514
I should have caught them.

03:12:35.775 --> 03:12:51.331
875 pages is hard to catch every error but I should have caught them and that's why I'm saying I'm just pleading that the students are not held responsible for any of my mistakes and that they're not held responsible for

03:12:53.633 --> 03:13:07.468
any of you know us being held accountable for some of the things we were told to do and then later told not to do and you know the confusion and just not being held accountable for what happened to this school that was out of everyone's control.

03:13:07.868 --> 03:13:12.293
But but as the executive director what happens at that school I take full accountability for.

03:13:13.494 --> 03:13:14.035
You're welcome.

03:13:14.235 --> 03:13:15.096
And thank you for your question.

03:13:16.892 --> 03:13:29.859
Good afternoon and thank you as well as all the students for sharing the experience of your school and the college going rates are very impressive and really something to be very proud of.

03:13:30.239 --> 03:13:36.863
I am a little concerned as I not just look at the sort of jolt that happened in 2016

03:13:38.564 --> 03:13:55.518
Part of, I think, what is equally concerning is that even before 2016, that it was in the low teens for math, so that there's a history that precedes this tumultuous event, which I'm sure, understandably, was very traumatic.

03:13:55.918 --> 03:14:00.362
But it was at 12% before for math proficiency.

03:14:03.285 --> 03:14:07.469
wanting to hear what else you have envisioned for the future.

03:14:07.489 --> 03:14:12.555
I think you reflected on some of the recommendations from LACOE around Saturday Academy.

03:14:14.598 --> 03:14:16.119
But what else is in store?

03:14:16.260 --> 03:14:19.684
And then also, we haven't really talked about the ELA scores.

03:14:20.244 --> 03:14:20.585
And I think

03:14:22.634 --> 03:14:34.661
Actually, there's been tremendous progress, right, where you had the low year on ELA going to 41%, and then coming back up to 49, so you're showing progress.

03:14:35.881 --> 03:14:46.047
But it also still puts you guys in the bottom half, whether it be like those resident schools or comparison schools, and if you can just address a little bit of the plans on ELA.

03:14:46.897 --> 03:15:02.635
Yeah, so with the ELA, we have noticed that through the tracking that that intervention class is really working in terms of the ELA test scores and the ELA population.

03:15:03.255 --> 03:15:19.198
A lot of what we have found out, which is why we revamped our college prep classes to include SBAC practice, is that the students are not scoring the lowest on the math problems that are written as math problems.

03:15:19.478 --> 03:15:29.100
They're scoring the lowest on the math problems that are written as sentences, word problems, because they're not clearly understanding what they're asking them.

03:15:29.520 --> 03:15:31.821
But when they're asked in a different way, the kids perform.

03:15:33.122 --> 03:15:46.834
So what we know is that we have to improve the comprehension and their reading level in order for them to be able to be successful because math is such more convoluted subject, it's more complicated, there's so many steps.

03:15:47.155 --> 03:15:55.903
And when you're dealing with students that are special needs, students that have high anxiety, and our students do understand and have expressed to me

03:15:57.084 --> 03:16:01.327
that miss, when we're taking like an SAT, it's different because we know it's for us.

03:16:01.727 --> 03:16:07.511
But when we take the SBAC, we know that this is for the school and their anxiety level increases.

03:16:07.672 --> 03:16:09.313
And it's like, okay, calm down.

03:16:09.553 --> 03:16:13.216
So we have to put in the counseling, the test taking strategies.

03:16:13.616 --> 03:16:17.539
And that was the reason why we said, okay, just having the CPM is not working.

03:16:17.919 --> 03:16:31.651
So, now we have math honors in 9th grade, we have math honors in 10th, 11th, and 12th, we have the AP courses too because we wanted to push that rigor, but we also are having the Saturday Academy and the kids are having math camp.

03:16:32.131 --> 03:16:35.614
So, our calculus teacher actually went to one of those

03:16:36.567 --> 03:16:41.090
like one of those shows, like a family feud type thing.

03:16:41.150 --> 03:16:48.093
I can't think of off the top of my head the show, but they pay the audience member, so they use the money in order to start doing Math Camp.

03:16:48.473 --> 03:16:57.838
So we do understand that there are needs, and when I tell you that we are there and we are implementing every strategy

03:16:58.098 --> 03:17:01.380
that we can get our hands on for these students, we are.

03:17:02.621 --> 03:17:06.684
We have college prep as an elective course, and that is the name of the class.

03:17:07.204 --> 03:17:08.645
The class is called college prep.

03:17:09.025 --> 03:17:12.787
And in that class, we do the math test prep strategies for them.

03:17:13.128 --> 03:17:22.934
So we are knowing that this year's scores are going to be much better, even with the students that transferred, because they're getting that extra dose on the weekends.

03:17:25.974 --> 03:17:30.315
Thank you very much for all of the answers to all of our questions.

03:17:30.955 --> 03:17:37.937
And I would like to ask the folks from LA County to come up in case there are any clarifying questions that people want to ask of them.

03:17:37.957 --> 03:17:44.479
And then we're going to complete our discussion and figure out how we want to vote.

03:17:51.641 --> 03:17:53.725
Yeah, Eileen, you were in the queue for this.

03:17:53.785 --> 03:17:57.352
Is there anybody else who wants to be in the queue for any questions here?

03:17:58.154 --> 03:17:58.495
Felicia?

03:18:00.305 --> 03:18:01.685
for CDE, okay.

03:18:01.765 --> 03:18:06.547
My question to LA County staff, thank you for your thorough presentation.

03:18:06.567 --> 03:18:13.329
I am interested in the five years that you had oversight and authorization for this charter.

03:18:13.889 --> 03:18:16.070
What oversight role did you have?

03:18:17.150 --> 03:18:19.711
What kind of directions and support were they given?

03:18:19.731 --> 03:18:22.712
And do you feel that they follow the directions?

03:18:22.772 --> 03:18:23.892
It was kind of a

03:18:24.692 --> 03:18:27.496
I kind of heard not a clear road.

03:18:27.516 --> 03:18:35.084
I'm just kind of interested in understanding the role of oversight because we're being asked if we approve it to now take over the oversight.

03:18:35.125 --> 03:18:37.828
So I'd like to understand the five-year process.

03:18:38.148 --> 03:18:44.015
My understanding is you had a good collaborative process with them in the early years and I'm just to help clarify and understand that.

03:18:45.161 --> 03:18:46.662
Yes, thank you for the question.

03:18:47.883 --> 03:19:01.310
This was a good school, a school on the rise at the last renewal that was doing very well in all areas academically as well as suspension rates and alternative data.

03:19:01.910 --> 03:19:05.192
And I would like to clarify that suspension rate that that

03:19:06.272 --> 03:19:09.854
An individual school suspension rate is based on the suspensions at that school.

03:19:10.434 --> 03:19:16.717
While there may be a record that transfers that does not affect the actual school suspension rate.

03:19:18.518 --> 03:19:29.683
You saw in the slide, we talked about the different, I had several slides that showed the different pieces as far as oversight and what we've done to try to provide support.

03:19:30.463 --> 03:19:35.106
We do, at LACO, per Ed Code, you are required to do at least one school site visit.

03:19:35.367 --> 03:19:39.609
We do at least two school site visits, and often more, depending on the school.

03:19:40.390 --> 03:19:54.779
We do, twice a year, we call all of our charters in, and we do a one-day training with them, and give them specific PD with experts from LACO in different areas.

03:19:55.760 --> 03:20:09.027
We also do an annual review where we ask them to create an annual report and speak out on all of their goals and what their action plans are for any unmet goals.

03:20:09.387 --> 03:20:21.553
We then meet with them and their leadership team at the end of the year to go over the year and give them specific feedback on the year and what we would like to see moving forward as well.

03:20:22.573 --> 03:20:45.969
And then on top of that, we have our coordinators who are that single point of contact and are kind of in a constant communication with them as far as submissions that they have to, things they have to submit to us on a monthly basis and ensuring that they have the resources, pointing them to different resources at LACO if there are more specific needs that our coordinator cannot meet.

03:20:47.862 --> 03:20:50.543
Thank you very much.

03:20:50.623 --> 03:20:51.464
Sue you had a question?

03:20:51.764 --> 03:21:02.469
I don't completely recall your presentation but I just wanted to ask a question about whether or not you considered alternative academic measures before making your recommendation.

03:21:02.489 --> 03:21:08.492
It seemed like mostly it was if not exclusively based on CASP data but I just wanted to clarify

03:21:08.772 --> 03:21:12.734
No, we absolutely pulled alternative data.

03:21:12.794 --> 03:21:15.936
So I don't think we directly tied it to that piece of Ed Code.

03:21:15.976 --> 03:21:32.305
But if you look in our report under finding two, we do look at alternative pieces of data such as suspension rate, graduation, chronic absenteeism.

03:21:32.405 --> 03:21:35.067
All of those different pieces are part of our report.

03:21:35.107 --> 03:21:36.868
We absolutely do take that into account.

03:21:41.946 --> 03:21:47.750
I feel like the errors in the petition kind of gave you no choice but to bring this forward.

03:21:48.611 --> 03:21:50.692
Can you explain the process with them to help?

03:21:51.750 --> 03:21:56.512
mitigate these issues because I feel like given the opportunity to repair what they could, they would have?

03:21:57.292 --> 03:21:57.492
Right.

03:21:58.153 --> 03:22:09.677
So one of the things we do with all of our renewals is we have a, the year prior to them coming up for renewal, we have a meeting with those schools that are up for renewal.

03:22:09.717 --> 03:22:16.340
We give them a binder that has all the different resources, goes through the different criteria, what exactly we'll be looking at.

03:22:16.400 --> 03:22:19.001
We have that meeting with them and go through all of those different pieces.

03:22:19.481 --> 03:22:36.009
Additionally, we offer to any of our schools that want to turn in their petitions early that we'll do an informal review prior to the official submission so that we can assess if there are any big holes or any missing pieces and give that back to them with that feedback.

03:22:36.530 --> 03:22:42.572
But they do have to turn that in early as opposed to sort of waiting to the end when we don't really have the time to do that.

03:22:44.053 --> 03:22:44.794
Did they not do that?

03:22:45.174 --> 03:22:45.434
Correct.

03:22:48.762 --> 03:22:51.024
I just want to sort of give a sense of process.

03:22:51.104 --> 03:23:00.292
What I'm thinking is that we have Kim, Patricia, and Ting on the list, and Felicia.

03:23:00.732 --> 03:23:04.575
I'd like us to break at some point and get our lunches and bring them back in.

03:23:06.117 --> 03:23:11.061
I'm thinking if we can keep ourselves moving efficiently, we can get through this list.

03:23:11.981 --> 03:23:20.887
And then thank them for answering our questions, get our lunches for 10 minutes, ask any other questions to CDE, finish our discussion.

03:23:21.067 --> 03:23:28.191
Okay, so I know I've saw people getting up and getting snacks and getting restless, so I just wanted to give us a plan.

03:23:29.712 --> 03:23:29.992
Sure.

03:23:30.012 --> 03:23:33.634
At what point you would like to have a motion that we're actually deliberating on?

03:23:33.694 --> 03:23:34.414
After our break.

03:23:34.635 --> 03:23:35.475
Okay.

03:23:36.796 --> 03:23:38.537
So Kim?

03:23:40.307 --> 03:23:41.927
Matt actually asked most of the question.

03:23:42.208 --> 03:23:44.408
Just one discrete follow-up question.

03:23:44.448 --> 03:23:46.789
Can you share what the high school graduation data was?

03:23:47.009 --> 03:23:48.469
I didn't see that in the slides.

03:23:49.550 --> 03:23:50.090
They do.

03:23:57.072 --> 03:24:00.233
There was also a question, too, I think at one point in their petition.

03:24:00.533 --> 03:24:07.715
There was a question between whether they were using the four-year cohort graduation data or a one-year cohort graduation data.

03:24:11.422 --> 03:24:21.189
16, 17, 17, 18.

03:24:17.606 --> 03:24:21.189
He mentioned it was one of the criteria that they determined.

03:24:22.190 --> 03:24:27.774
Right, so the cohort, the 2018 four-year cohort graduation rate was 90%.

03:24:29.735 --> 03:24:37.620
We noted within our report, again, that the WASP visiting committee did note that the graduation rate was high, but that there needed to be an increase in rigor in the classroom.

03:24:37.640 --> 03:24:38.461
Yeah, thank you.

03:24:41.663 --> 03:24:43.944
Good afternoon, and thank you for being here today.

03:24:44.564 --> 03:24:58.768
I need to say that we're accustomed at this level, when we have these appeals, to hear disputes about communication problems and about who's telling the truth or who's misrepresenting some information or some misinformation.

03:24:59.208 --> 03:25:03.469
But my eyes and my ears immediately perked up when the conversation turned

03:25:03.929 --> 03:25:05.431
to the credentialing issue.

03:25:05.871 --> 03:25:13.118
So do you all or does the district do the credential monitoring, the assignment monitoring for this charter school?

03:25:13.658 --> 03:25:18.783
We actually do on an annual basis for all of our schools check credentials.

03:25:18.823 --> 03:25:24.088
So they will submit a list of their staff to us twice a year and we will go through and check those credentials.

03:25:25.430 --> 03:25:27.492
And if you notice, I think there was

03:25:30.293 --> 03:25:32.096
A lot of the stuff brought up by Ms.

03:25:32.156 --> 03:25:45.013
Sims was conversations and was things that we were going back and forth with in the court, but none of those particular pieces were in our report that had nothing to do with any of our findings or any of our recommendations.

03:25:45.233 --> 03:25:54.059
Yeah, so that's what I was going to be asking about was a concern about the credentialing issue because it didn't seem to show up in your findings.

03:25:54.419 --> 03:26:08.349
But there was a statement made about the authorization for the environmental science teacher that I want to make sure we do correct so that we don't have a misunderstanding about that issue and another opportunity for some misinformation.

03:26:08.949 --> 03:26:15.513
In Title V of the CTC regs, it's in Section 80005A.

03:26:16.253 --> 03:26:19.775
That's what happens when you have this identic memory, people get nervous about it.

03:26:20.275 --> 03:26:27.760
It clarifies what the authorization for subject matter is for service credentials in subject areas like math and science.

03:26:28.260 --> 03:26:31.642
On page 26 of the Administrative Assignment Manual,

03:26:32.102 --> 03:26:46.428
There is a chart that explains what the subject matter authorizations are and then what are the subjects assigned under those authorizations that are considered related content.

03:26:46.468 --> 03:26:51.250
That means a teacher who has this authorization can teach that related content.

03:26:51.650 --> 03:26:52.711
So what I heard

03:26:55.193 --> 03:27:09.887
from the leader of this school was that what she feels is material to some of the conversations and the problems that she's having with you as an example of her concerns with the monitoring and guidance you've been giving her.

03:27:10.407 --> 03:27:15.229
is this back and forth about the authorization for her environmental science teacher.

03:27:15.649 --> 03:27:25.112
The authorizations manual lists four different science authorizations, biological science, chemistry, physics, as well as geosciences.

03:27:25.512 --> 03:27:35.015
And it only says for biological science, you have to have the biological science credential, and that can give you an authorization to teach environmental science.

03:27:35.415 --> 03:27:38.796
Is there any dispute, as far as you're concerned,

03:27:39.176 --> 03:27:45.461
about whether or not her teacher, who is teaching environmental science, has the appropriate authorization.

03:27:46.281 --> 03:27:46.461
No.

03:27:47.782 --> 03:27:49.483
He has a chemistry authorization.

03:27:49.523 --> 03:27:55.368
Well, then there is a problem, because there's no flexibility in that authorization to teach environmental science.

03:27:55.708 --> 03:28:08.557
The reason why I ask that question is because, again, that was not an issue raised in your charter or in your concern about the issues that you are raising behind why the school should be denied.

03:28:09.048 --> 03:28:10.829
Okay, so I just wanted to make sure I said that.

03:28:10.869 --> 03:28:22.672
So he has a chemistry authorization, which means he really isn't authorized to teach environmental science, but you are not making that as an issue material to why you said the charter needs to be denied.

03:28:22.892 --> 03:28:23.233
Correct.

03:28:23.813 --> 03:28:31.015
When we talked about employee qualifications, we talked about the EL authorizations was one of the big pieces we spoke about.

03:28:31.255 --> 03:28:32.176
Yeah, and I understand that.

03:28:32.216 --> 03:28:37.679
So the EL authorizations is one of the reasons I'm concerned about what's in the charter itself and the program description.

03:28:37.719 --> 03:28:38.459
So I got you.

03:28:38.619 --> 03:28:39.380
All right, I'm there.

03:28:42.201 --> 03:28:50.826
This wasn't exactly my question, but does the charter written so that they are using the flexibility under 47605L for certification?

03:28:52.487 --> 03:28:56.089
That's the charter flexibility for the credential.

03:28:56.109 --> 03:29:00.312
It wasn't mentioned in the charter petition.

03:29:00.822 --> 03:29:06.053
OK, but it sounds like that the U.S.

03:29:06.154 --> 03:29:10.383
authorizer was holding them to no flexibility under the charter.

03:29:12.828 --> 03:29:17.492
Yeah, there is flexibility for certain courses, but not for those core courses.

03:29:18.173 --> 03:29:24.078
We tend to fall back on our credentialing experts within LACO when we have questions about that.

03:29:24.098 --> 03:29:24.278
Okay.

03:29:24.718 --> 03:29:31.905
And then the executive director talked a little bit about the change in coordinators and getting kind of advice.

03:29:31.945 --> 03:29:33.426
Can you speak a little bit to that?

03:29:33.829 --> 03:29:37.570
So we did have a, there was a new coordinator that came in.

03:29:37.610 --> 03:29:39.911
I have both the coordinators here today.

03:29:40.591 --> 03:29:47.334
Our coordinators work very closely together whenever there is a transition from one coordinator to another.

03:29:48.054 --> 03:30:00.338
And so any of that communication in the beginning when Mr. Hartman was taking over from Mr. Brown, Mr. Brown was CC'd on all of those and they were in communication so that they knew exactly what

03:30:00.738 --> 03:30:04.000
was being presented to the school.

03:30:09.524 --> 03:30:13.067
Yes, I'll try to be brief, but I have been uncharacteristically patient.

03:30:16.409 --> 03:30:18.290
My questions are actually for Lisa.

03:30:20.311 --> 03:30:20.892
Yes, thank you.

03:30:22.365 --> 03:30:26.471
So a couple of things were clarified, and Lisa, I just want you to nod if it's true.

03:30:26.912 --> 03:30:29.655
The suspensions do not follow the students.

03:30:29.735 --> 03:30:35.143
So any suspension rate reported for this school was earned at this particular school site.

03:30:35.343 --> 03:30:35.543
Yes.

03:30:35.783 --> 03:30:35.984
Yes.

03:30:36.504 --> 03:30:36.604
OK.

03:30:37.145 --> 03:30:51.984
So when we're looking at this data, and for all the students that came in the administration and the new leadership, I know how difficult it is to rebuild a school culture and a school when there's been a rough transition.

03:30:52.444 --> 03:30:53.264
So thank you all.

03:30:53.304 --> 03:30:56.145
You're very, for the students, you're very courageous to come.

03:30:56.205 --> 03:31:01.447
I don't know that in high school I would have been able to address a bunch of adults that are sitting up here in Sacramento.

03:31:02.388 --> 03:31:03.048
But thank you.

03:31:03.248 --> 03:31:04.068
Mucha suerte.

03:31:04.168 --> 03:31:07.229
I know that many of you are going on to college and I'm very proud of you.

03:31:07.289 --> 03:31:08.810
You make our community very proud.

03:31:10.251 --> 03:31:15.254
The humanization of the story is what's making it difficult.

03:31:15.474 --> 03:31:28.702
Because when I look at the scores, and I understand that a test score does not define a student, but to be perfectly honest, when charter schools appeal to their local board or to the county board or to the state board,

03:31:29.102 --> 03:31:32.023
to make a case, they're looking at those standardized test scores.

03:31:32.063 --> 03:31:34.064
And they're saying, we can do better than this.

03:31:34.264 --> 03:31:39.026
That is pretty much the premise of a proposal when they bring it before an innovation, right?

03:31:39.246 --> 03:31:45.649
But they're looking at it and saying, look, these schools are not serving students, and we can do better, and look at their standardized test scores.

03:31:46.129 --> 03:31:49.991
So we use that in our favor, I guess, to get a proposal passed.

03:31:50.031 --> 03:31:52.812
And we also use it to say, but that doesn't tell the entire story.

03:31:53.312 --> 03:31:57.534
So that argument could go both ways, and we've seen it here.

03:31:58.374 --> 03:32:04.958
Now, we have seen growth in the last year, and I think that there is a promising trend because there is strong leadership.

03:32:05.599 --> 03:32:13.084
I will warn that I'm not convinced that we know how to serve our ELL students, our ELL students.

03:32:13.884 --> 03:32:24.672
The fact that ELPAC was never mentioned, the fact that summative ELPAC was never mentioned, initial, just tells me that there is not a depth of knowledge in terms of how to properly serve.

03:32:24.812 --> 03:32:27.774
And it may be it's because they're talking about four students.

03:32:28.294 --> 03:32:39.521
But when you're trying to scale and incorporate middle school, that can be an excuse, because now you're increasing your pool of L students.

03:32:39.541 --> 03:32:43.743
I don't think they're ready to increase and expand.

03:32:44.063 --> 03:32:49.627
I think that if we are looking just at the high school, that changes the story, because I see a promising trend.

03:32:50.567 --> 03:32:58.775
I am bothered, however, by our report on the promising trend from 2016 to 2017 on the SBAC data.

03:32:59.295 --> 03:33:04.040
Why did we decide to not include students with disabilities when looking at?

03:33:04.560 --> 03:33:10.406
So the paragraph here is, if you do not include students with disabilities, this is a percent pupils met.

03:33:10.946 --> 03:33:14.290
And if you don't include students with disabilities, now we're looking at this percent.

03:33:14.930 --> 03:33:26.295
I think that sets a very dangerous precedent when we're excluding a subgroup from the analysis because the next time it could be if you don't look at L's then this would have been their gains.

03:33:26.635 --> 03:33:29.136
So look at our own memo on page

03:33:30.464 --> 03:33:30.924
Let's see.

03:33:31.545 --> 03:33:35.887
It's page 6 of 13, when we're looking at the review of their criteria.

03:33:36.587 --> 03:33:36.887
Here I go.

03:33:37.287 --> 03:33:39.108
The sections are popular today.

03:33:39.188 --> 03:33:42.650
Section 4607.

03:33:43.230 --> 03:33:49.013
We're giving an analysis of their growth, but we're intentionally excluding students with disabilities.

03:33:49.394 --> 03:33:51.094
And I think that that's dangerous.

03:33:52.355 --> 03:33:55.477
And I don't want to see that ever again in a memo, because what's next?

03:33:55.917 --> 03:33:59.519
If you take out the Latinos, this is what their group performance would have been.

03:34:00.583 --> 03:34:04.225
I don't know if this was our internal analysis or their analysis.

03:34:04.445 --> 03:34:06.006
So it would help to clarify.

03:34:06.026 --> 03:34:06.066
OK.

03:34:06.967 --> 03:34:08.267
And I will apologize.

03:34:08.587 --> 03:34:10.488
Where are you referring to, board member?

03:34:10.729 --> 03:34:14.471
Our own memo, page 6 of 13.

03:34:18.513 --> 03:34:18.613
Oh.

03:34:19.053 --> 03:34:20.474
So in the memo itself.

03:34:20.794 --> 03:34:21.314
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:34:21.535 --> 03:34:21.735
Yes.

03:34:22.175 --> 03:34:22.375
Got it.

03:34:25.669 --> 03:34:28.331
And how many students with disabilities does a school have?

03:34:28.431 --> 03:34:30.133
Because it doesn't have a performance color.

03:34:30.173 --> 03:34:33.595
This was actually the school's review, so it was not CDE's review.

03:34:34.536 --> 03:34:38.919
Okay, never a good idea to exclude a student subgroup, ever.

03:34:40.240 --> 03:34:43.062
Cindy Kazanis with the Analysis, Measurement, and Accountability Reporting Division.

03:34:43.323 --> 03:34:52.510
For grade 11, for this past year, they had eight students with disabilities, so we would not even provide you information on the dashboard because of the small end size.

03:34:53.550 --> 03:34:55.010
And that I get, because we don't have the 30.

03:34:55.491 --> 03:35:03.913
But in the analysis, what bothers me is when we say, without students with disabilities, this would be the gain or the growth.

03:35:04.433 --> 03:35:05.993
That came directly from the school.

03:35:06.413 --> 03:35:06.493
Yeah.

03:35:06.513 --> 03:35:07.734
It came directly from the school.

03:35:07.834 --> 03:35:08.054
OK.

03:35:08.634 --> 03:35:10.234
That's, you know, no.

03:35:10.834 --> 03:35:11.615
We just can't.

03:35:11.675 --> 03:35:12.755
That is wrong at every level.

03:35:24.448 --> 03:35:28.891
break and come back with our lunches and then we'll continue our deliberations.

03:35:29.551 --> 03:35:30.052
Thank you.

03:35:35.355 --> 03:35:36.275
I think we're going to

03:35:41.408 --> 03:35:44.090
We're gonna try to get going here.

03:35:44.650 --> 03:35:54.898
We've had a lot of opportunities for lots of questions and answers, and there may be further discussion, there may be a motion, so we're ready to proceed.

03:35:54.918 --> 03:35:57.900
Who would like to be recognized, Sue?

03:36:00.090 --> 03:36:02.151
So I'm prepared to make a motion.

03:36:03.591 --> 03:36:22.278
I'll just say that based on the testimony and again of fulfilling the needs for students and their parents in this area I think this school fits the bill and so I'd like to make a motion to approve the charter petition of the Los Angeles International Charter School with a couple of conditions.

03:36:23.118 --> 03:36:30.504
that we would be approving it at the high school level so for its current grade levels that are operating.

03:36:31.625 --> 03:36:43.455
That the petition would be revised to reflect the State Board of Education as the authorizer and include the necessary language specified in the department's petition review form.

03:36:44.015 --> 03:36:52.762
And I'll let Lisa ask questions about that or just to clarify, but many of the concerns that were raised about elements would have to be added to the charter.

03:36:53.802 --> 03:36:59.146
And that the charter school will develop a plan to improve students' mathematical outcomes.

03:36:59.727 --> 03:37:09.534
And that the plan would identify a support provider that's agreeable to the SBE that would assist with strategic planning and implementation throughout the renewal term.

03:37:10.214 --> 03:37:26.181
And I think I handed out a written motion, and I believe that it's not necessary to cap the charter school enrollment, but just to be clear about operating at the high school grade levels, because we wanna make sure that they have the ability to operate effectively.

03:37:26.481 --> 03:37:27.402
So that's my motion.

03:37:27.422 --> 03:37:32.064
Okay, so moved, and do we have a second?

03:37:33.061 --> 03:37:33.502
I'll second.

03:37:34.503 --> 03:37:48.142
All right we can take discussion on the motion and I'll kick that off by just asking what could you be a little more specific about the nature of the mathematics support that you are suggesting?

03:37:49.263 --> 03:38:05.028
I think we just want to be clear that because math performance does seem to be where their most significant struggle is, at least as it's reflected on the CASP scores, make sure that they're getting some outside advice from a provider that they can select.

03:38:05.948 --> 03:38:08.349
It could be the county office if they chose to do that.

03:38:08.429 --> 03:38:14.711
It could be a nonprofit provider, but that would come in with a specific plan about how to implement and how to improve

03:38:15.651 --> 03:38:16.932
students' math performance.

03:38:16.972 --> 03:38:18.793
Could be a professional development provider.

03:38:18.813 --> 03:38:21.495
Could be a professional development provider, absolutely.

03:38:21.575 --> 03:38:22.155
That's helpful.

03:38:24.256 --> 03:38:24.596
Thank you.

03:38:24.636 --> 03:38:27.638
Patricia, Eileen, anybody else who wants to be in the queue?

03:38:28.378 --> 03:38:29.079
All right, go ahead.

03:38:29.539 --> 03:38:40.485
Okay, so I do have a concern that their environmental science teacher is misassigned, and I further have a concern that the administrator doesn't clearly understand the assignment monitoring responsibilities

03:38:40.905 --> 03:38:47.830
that she would have and there seems to be a lack of understanding about the certifications and authorizations required.

03:38:48.450 --> 03:38:58.497
So I know that the department takes over the assignment monitoring responsibilities if this motion as you have listed is approved.

03:38:59.915 --> 03:39:09.842
But I can't support this motion without some requirement to take a look at and address the assignment monitoring confusion that seems to be there so that we are clear.

03:39:10.362 --> 03:39:26.434
And I want to make sure I didn't give misinformation about whether or not, as a core subject, there is no flexibility on the assignment of the environmental sciences teacher and that they must have a biology credential, not a chemistry credential.

03:39:26.994 --> 03:39:36.856
There has to be something added to this motion to do the assignment monitoring, and if a problem is identified, some work has to be done to correct that post-haste.

03:39:37.496 --> 03:39:42.817
I think adding it as a general proposition makes sense.

03:39:42.857 --> 03:39:53.699
There are people of supplemental authorizations and so on, so I don't think we wanna go deep in the rabbit hole right now, but we could consider that as an amendment, yes.

03:39:57.623 --> 03:39:58.744
There are others in the queue.

03:39:58.824 --> 03:40:00.185
It's Eileen and then we'll go to you.

03:40:00.365 --> 03:40:02.207
I thought you were addressing that specific issue.

03:40:02.387 --> 03:40:03.849
I just want to ask the condition.

03:40:03.869 --> 03:40:10.576
So I really believe there's good intent with the current staff, but I feel like they need a lot of support to

03:40:11.176 --> 03:40:27.756
be successful, and my worry is that CDE is a small team that's trying to oversight, so I'm trying to understand what you're expecting or anticipating in the support provider role, because I believe they're going to need some support and guidance.

03:40:30.098 --> 03:40:32.359
And I'm not sure it's only in mathematics.

03:40:32.599 --> 03:40:38.721
And so that they get some external support to guide their work.

03:40:38.881 --> 03:40:43.203
So, because I feel like in some ways they're disconnected with some of the newer strategies in English learners.

03:40:43.283 --> 03:40:46.664
And I believe their intent is good, but we're gonna need to provide support.

03:40:46.704 --> 03:40:53.567
And I'm worried that if we say we take on the authorization without specifically saying you're gonna need some external guidance here.

03:40:54.007 --> 03:40:58.029
So did you have any plans or ideas when you drafted this about what,

03:40:58.989 --> 03:41:00.210
Is it just in mathematics?

03:41:02.231 --> 03:41:09.954
Yeah, that was my intent, but I'm certainly happy to entertain friendly amendments if you think that needs to be in there.

03:41:10.094 --> 03:41:26.361
I think there are, as you know, and Member Sun could speak to this as well, there are a number of charter support providers, whether it's the Charter School Association or the Charter School Development Center, that I'm guessing would jump up and help them if they ask.

03:41:32.074 --> 03:41:43.066
So just really quickly to address the credential piece, I thought I remember the executive director saying it wasn't chemistry, there was something else, there was another credential in there too.

03:41:43.387 --> 03:41:44.428
But either here or there.

03:41:45.008 --> 03:41:48.612
I would say either here or there, that's fine.

03:41:50.675 --> 03:41:52.356
So, I just have a comment.

03:41:52.456 --> 03:42:01.084
I think I really take to heart board member Rucker's comment about hey, sometimes we look at innovation, sometimes we look at test scores.

03:42:01.324 --> 03:42:02.104
Where do we want to go?

03:42:02.185 --> 03:42:06.728
And I think board member Ortiz-Lacombe said something very similar.

03:42:08.050 --> 03:42:14.355
around how we could utilize those standardized test scores for good, for approval or not approval.

03:42:14.896 --> 03:42:15.897
And I get that.

03:42:17.078 --> 03:42:18.399
We have a lot of data.

03:42:18.799 --> 03:42:19.980
We don't have good guidance.

03:42:20.020 --> 03:42:21.342
That's in law right now.

03:42:22.142 --> 03:42:25.505
And how do we make decisions around this?

03:42:25.706 --> 03:42:28.008
And I dislike being inconsistent.

03:42:28.088 --> 03:42:29.889
I just don't like being inconsistent.

03:42:30.810 --> 03:42:32.111
I say that, however,

03:42:33.072 --> 03:42:43.776
I think that when we look at these charters, and we look at the people, and we look at the context from which they come, there is a gestalt to this, where the sum of the parts are more than the whole.

03:42:44.876 --> 03:42:52.339
And so when you look at it in that manner, it will swing, in my case, decisions one way or the other.

03:42:52.359 --> 03:42:56.501
And it may seem inconsistent from one charge to another, why did you make this decision?

03:42:57.041 --> 03:43:01.563
But I think that as educators, we know that there isn't

03:43:02.836 --> 03:43:12.802
check boxes for everything, especially when we're dealing with human beings and we're dealing with context and situations.

03:43:12.822 --> 03:43:18.326
So because of that, I would support friendly amendments to this.

03:43:18.706 --> 03:43:23.549
I do believe that this charter deserves another chance.

03:43:30.336 --> 03:43:37.161
I also think that there is a positive trend that we're seeing if we keep it at the high school.

03:43:37.762 --> 03:43:50.652
I want to clarify, Sue, you've mentioned before, if we were to authorize as just high school and in a year we see a decline, which is hopefully not what happens if it's approved,

03:43:51.252 --> 03:43:55.993
then what are, at that point, we also have options to revoke, correct?

03:43:56.293 --> 03:44:20.698
So if you could tell me a little bit more about that, and also I want to add to Board Member Straus, in making the support a little bit more comprehensive beyond math, although we did see that with math, I also feel that instruction for L students could benefit from that, and maybe going back there'll be other things that they will also want to be reflective on and act upon.

03:44:21.378 --> 03:44:21.678
Thank you.

03:44:23.339 --> 03:44:37.926
So maybe we'll ask Judy or Lisa to clarify, but yes, we have the option to revoke if they do not measure up based on our approval and based on our expectations that are outlined in these conditions.

03:44:43.157 --> 03:44:44.378
Yes, you do have the option to revoke.

03:44:44.719 --> 03:44:47.541
There's specific standards and findings that must be made.

03:44:47.981 --> 03:44:49.783
It's a two-step process.

03:44:49.823 --> 03:44:53.646
We would have to give them a notice, opportunity to fix the problem, a notice to cure.

03:44:54.006 --> 03:44:56.488
So it's a complicated process, but it's certainly doable.

03:44:57.409 --> 03:45:02.213
I'd like to clarify for Member Burr, this plan would be agreeable to the SBE.

03:45:02.253 --> 03:45:04.375
I think we meant the SBE Executive Director.

03:45:04.415 --> 03:45:07.678
So we're not saying that you guys need to talk about this at a next meeting.

03:45:14.242 --> 03:45:27.888
Mechanically so we would be doing a grant for one year for five years and then but there is the option if things are not going well

03:45:28.669 --> 03:45:30.430
to revoke before the five years are up.

03:45:30.650 --> 03:45:36.992
And for example, academic performance data would come back to us automatically just as, okay.

03:45:37.372 --> 03:45:48.497
Yeah, I mean, just to clarify, and Lisa can do this much better, but in all of the charter schools that we oversee, they do annual reviews.

03:45:48.557 --> 03:45:56.200
We get an annual report on how they're doing based on academic performance and other alternative measures as we've talked about.

03:45:59.309 --> 03:46:06.192
Annually, we do an academic memo and a fiscal memo so that the board knows how all of their schools are doing annually.

03:46:06.612 --> 03:46:12.114
So we do those memos on opposite months that the board meets.

03:46:12.975 --> 03:46:16.356
Actually, we're gearing up now for the academic memo in June.

03:46:17.356 --> 03:46:19.157
and then a fiscal memo in August.

03:46:19.197 --> 03:46:21.517
So we do do those on an annual basis.

03:46:22.698 --> 03:46:33.321
And so if there are any particular conditions about whether a year from now or a year from when the school opens, the board wants to, you know, see that, that you let me know.

03:46:33.401 --> 03:46:38.222
I mean, we can provide whatever information you need a year in or whatever works best for the board.

03:46:39.134 --> 03:46:49.157
I just want to make a comment, which is that I think it's very apparent from public comment what an exceptional warm and welcoming environment has been created.

03:46:49.197 --> 03:46:52.338
And that is absolutely a unique thing to be appreciated.

03:46:53.739 --> 03:46:58.480
It doesn't at any point mean that folks are off the hook for academic performance.

03:46:58.560 --> 03:47:02.361
We need kids to actually be learning as well as welcomed.

03:47:02.982 --> 03:47:07.003
And that two-step is absolutely necessary in my mind.

03:47:18.156 --> 03:47:25.619
Okay, so what Board Member Portillo-Brownson just said is what I want to touch on.

03:47:25.659 --> 03:47:29.521
The reason that this motion is being proposed

03:47:30.669 --> 03:47:35.511
Let's be clear, the school is not performing well.

03:47:36.371 --> 03:47:45.374
But the reason this motion is being proposed is because there is this human element, this issue of human capacity.

03:47:46.134 --> 03:47:58.339
What is also being addressed in this motion is that if the school were to close, the schools and campuses these students would return to are not doing their job.

03:47:59.212 --> 03:48:13.127
And so part of the reason behind why this motion is being proposed is because we feel compelled to let the students who came to talk to us today about their needs.

03:48:13.707 --> 03:48:17.531
We feel compelled that we need to listen to those students.

03:48:18.570 --> 03:48:32.275
So given that, it's a mistake to believe that approving the school to be an SBE charter is going to solve the problems of the other schools that these students could have returned to.

03:48:32.975 --> 03:48:42.538
In a year when these test scores don't go up, they will still face the possibility of returning to a school campus where they are not safe.

03:48:43.118 --> 03:48:50.162
and we will still be faced with the possibility that these students will choose not to go back to school if that happens.

03:48:50.743 --> 03:49:12.476
So if we're trying to approve a motion based on the idea that we can revoke the school if the school is not improving, the reason why we're trying to propose this motion is not related at all to our priority belief in the ability of the school to approve, but it's more to continue supporting the students

03:49:12.896 --> 03:49:19.240
and giving them the opportunity to continue flourishing in a school where they want to feel safe.

03:49:19.840 --> 03:49:25.063
So I have a concern about that because that is the unspoken element in this motion.

03:49:25.644 --> 03:49:37.071
But further, this motion as currently written, without all the revisions that would need to be written, this motion does not fully address all of the reasons

03:49:37.631 --> 03:49:43.498
that the staff stated are the reasons why the petition should be denied.

03:49:43.518 --> 03:49:51.867
Now, I know there's a statement in the motion that says the staff will, what does it say?

03:49:52.908 --> 03:49:55.569
specified in the department's petition review form.

03:49:56.029 --> 03:50:05.172
I don't really know what that means because I'm not clear that that addresses all of the reasons the staff gave for why the petition should be denied.

03:50:05.592 --> 03:50:16.335
So we can feel good about creating a motion that will address all the reasons why the petition should be denied as part of the conditions for renewal, but I am not.

03:50:16.495 --> 03:50:20.776
The premise would be that we're creating an opportunity for this leadership

03:50:21.156 --> 03:50:38.502
to continue to demonstrate their effectiveness, but I don't believe in the promise that we will come back and revoke this school if they really don't improve, because the only reason why we're making this motion is we're paying more attention to the students than to the fact that this school is failing.

03:50:39.823 --> 03:50:43.904
All right, Matt, you are next, and then I'm gonna put myself in the queue, and then Felicia's in the queue.

03:50:45.834 --> 03:50:46.195
Go ahead.

03:50:46.897 --> 03:50:52.389
Well, I would just like to say that I understand board member.

03:50:54.784 --> 03:51:03.610
Rocker's view that is not that would not be the reason I would vote for the motion Because there is clear evidence of gain in English language arts.

03:51:03.670 --> 03:51:24.484
It's been substantial in math It's just edging up, but there is a lot of evidence that there are plans to improve and there's a 90% graduation rate I would not approve a motion for a charter where there was no improvement evidence Partly if we vote on this it's because we see the capacity for improvement and we see some evidence of it

03:51:25.565 --> 03:51:26.186
Matt, you're next.

03:51:31.271 --> 03:51:45.025
So I agree with you wholeheartedly that we can debate the numbers and I remember our state superintendent yesterday saying school is not defined by a single number.

03:51:45.899 --> 03:51:50.741
And there's so much more to what happens with a school beyond a number.

03:51:51.441 --> 03:51:55.243
There are public schools that are struggling to improve.

03:51:56.103 --> 03:51:59.965
This is a charter school that seems to me struggling to improve.

03:52:03.835 --> 03:52:10.136
edge on the side of grace when it comes to improvement, when someone's had such a short amount of time to do it.

03:52:11.056 --> 03:52:16.798
That being said, I want to make sure I understand the process here because I'm new.

03:52:17.898 --> 03:52:28.040
When the county office denies the petition and we accept the petition, then that falls to the CDE staff obligation for oversight.

03:52:29.041 --> 03:52:34.530
How many charters does the CDE staff oversee now?

03:52:40.122 --> 03:52:48.623
Once the State Board approves a charter that's been denied renewal on appeal then the State Board becomes the authorizer that's been delegated to CDE staff.

03:52:49.643 --> 03:53:02.306
So right now we have 32 schools one of those being a statewide benefit that has nine sites so we're at about 40 sites but 32 schools that we provide oversight for.

03:53:06.289 --> 03:53:09.391
and you're responsible for bringing them back for non-renewal?

03:53:10.232 --> 03:53:10.432
Yes.

03:53:10.812 --> 03:53:20.259
So if the state board takes action today to make it a state board authorized school, we take over oversight, and then it will be our, well, they, I take that back.

03:53:20.599 --> 03:53:26.603
They, at the end of that five years, would have to go back locally first, and in this case would be LAUSD.

03:53:27.363 --> 03:53:30.966
And if they are denied there, then can come back to the state board.

03:53:40.169 --> 03:53:54.440
I also want to echo the comments of Madam President, because for me, if we would have seen decline from last year to this year, I would not be OK with supporting this recommendation.

03:53:56.461 --> 03:54:03.544
One, because when I look out there, I see 90%, 100% students of color and the majority of them being Latinx youth.

03:54:04.064 --> 03:54:17.530
And so for me, when I'm looking at who is serving my community, in particular my babies from my community, I would not just, you know, just overlook the fact, and the story wouldn't motivate me if I wasn't seeing that there was a promising growth.

03:54:18.430 --> 03:54:23.813
At the end of the day, our students will not be evaluated by what a caring school environment they had.

03:54:23.873 --> 03:54:32.638
When they're submitting to UCLA, to Berkeley, to any of these schools, what they're looking at is a comprehensive student that has academic growth and academic standing.

03:54:33.178 --> 03:54:35.980
And so, yes, it's important to have a safe environment.

03:54:36.100 --> 03:54:47.648
I think the school leadership has heard loud and clear that beyond that, when we are working to build a student and we're building a safe community and a supportive community, it's to get them to the academic performance.

03:54:47.908 --> 03:54:48.888
It's not to keep them there.

03:54:49.249 --> 03:54:51.010
That will not help us, right?

03:54:51.030 --> 03:54:59.876
I could tell my babies and I could tell my kids that I love them, and if I'm not challenging them, if I'm not equipping them, they're not gonna survive, they're not going to be selective, they're not gonna be competitive.

03:55:00.276 --> 03:55:01.357
So I think that,

03:55:01.937 --> 03:55:08.965
For me, if it would have been steady decline, there's no way that this would have been something I could support.

03:55:09.385 --> 03:55:12.228
I'm also looking at this through this lens of continuous improvement.

03:55:12.709 --> 03:55:16.232
One of the schools that was cited had zero percent proficiency rate in math.

03:55:16.573 --> 03:55:17.334
Zero percent.

03:55:17.694 --> 03:55:19.055
Another school in that community.

03:55:19.676 --> 03:55:28.045
Okay, so we could look at that district school and say, we are going to support you with continuous improvement, but we won't do this to this school that is having some growth.

03:55:28.726 --> 03:55:32.890
That, I'm about equity, I'm about civil rights, and I also need to balance that out.

03:55:33.251 --> 03:55:37.235
If we're going to be about continuous improvement, then we need to extend that to all of our schools.

03:55:41.130 --> 03:55:56.810
I agree with like everybody who spoke and you know it comes to this conversation which is really sad is that you know as oh is it not on oh okay what Ortiz and Kwon said was really true is huh oh lean it okay I'm sorry it's just like

03:55:57.711 --> 03:56:02.892
It's very troubling to see that students of color, low income students, have to always make this decision.

03:56:02.972 --> 03:56:04.632
If I go to this school, I'm going to struggle.

03:56:04.672 --> 03:56:07.633
But if I stay in this school, this school still needs improvement.

03:56:08.193 --> 03:56:09.653
And it's really hard to see that.

03:56:09.753 --> 03:56:11.034
I see that in my community.

03:56:11.154 --> 03:56:12.654
I see that in communities everywhere.

03:56:13.254 --> 03:56:17.355
And we need to start doing better as a state board.

03:56:17.695 --> 03:56:18.935
Districts need to do better.

03:56:19.275 --> 03:56:22.976
California, the whole world needs to do better when it comes to how we're treating education.

03:56:23.276 --> 03:56:26.737
Because I don't like this conversation of us always trying to improve things.

03:56:27.297 --> 03:56:32.602
Like when we're talking about IB programs, AP programs, every student should have access to those things.

03:56:32.942 --> 03:56:35.023
They shouldn't be having to fight for these things.

03:56:35.624 --> 03:56:38.226
And so you know I wish you all luck.

03:56:38.286 --> 03:56:46.833
I'm supporting this motion because I'm going to have faith in this school because I want to make sure that if you all don't feel comfortable going to another school I understand that.

03:56:47.773 --> 03:56:51.175
I come from a community that's very similar to LA.

03:56:51.195 --> 03:56:52.376
You know, I'm from East Oakland.

03:56:52.756 --> 03:56:57.359
And so, yeah, it's just, it's really hard to see this every single year.

03:56:57.419 --> 03:57:01.362
I mean, every single time we meet, when I'm on the local school board, and I'm just tired of it.

03:57:01.442 --> 03:57:03.403
So I really hope that we could improve in the future.

03:57:07.256 --> 03:57:13.721
Are ready to restate the motion in terms of what all is in it.

03:57:13.741 --> 03:57:23.908
So I will restate what the motion is but again happy to take friendly amendments especially with respect to any support that you think the charter school might need.

03:57:23.968 --> 03:57:31.133
But I am moving to approve the petition for the Los Angeles international charter school at the high school level.

03:57:32.315 --> 03:57:45.429
The petition with the following conditions, the petition will be revised to reflect the State Board of Education as the authorizer and include the necessary language specified in the department's petition review form.

03:57:46.250 --> 03:57:52.297
The charter school will develop a plan to improve students mathematical outcomes, the plan will identify a math

03:57:53.338 --> 03:58:02.805
Excuse me, support provider agreeable to the SBE executive director who will assist with strategic planning and implementation throughout the renewal term.

03:58:04.026 --> 03:58:07.168
Do we incorporate friendly amendments now or after?

03:58:07.549 --> 03:58:08.129
Yes.

03:58:08.449 --> 03:58:10.531
Because that motion has been seconded.

03:58:10.911 --> 03:58:18.016
Member Burke can we clarify the high school program that means not the independent study it's just the high school program as it's currently constituted?

03:58:18.096 --> 03:58:18.237
Yes.

03:58:23.155 --> 03:58:27.517
and there were a couple of friendly amendments and we wanna, Eileen.

03:58:27.697 --> 03:58:42.824
My recommendation would be that you just take out mathematical support provider and identify a support provider because we've identified math as a goal, but it's probably gonna include things like aligning practice to standards and teaching practices, lots of things.

03:58:42.864 --> 03:58:45.805
So I just think if you just leave it a support provider, we'd be okay.

03:58:46.565 --> 03:58:47.666
I'd like to accept that.

03:58:53.331 --> 03:58:56.414
Academic program support provider including math.

03:58:56.834 --> 03:59:15.852
I'd like to have it specified and but not limited to and Patricia Motion I can support the motion if the friendly amendment includes the issue concerning the assignment monitoring at whatever broad level

03:59:17.307 --> 03:59:21.510
12,000 foot level, we need to put that in so that we're very clear on what that would be.

03:59:21.990 --> 03:59:23.631
We also do check that twice a year.

03:59:23.651 --> 03:59:24.132
OK.

03:59:24.772 --> 03:59:38.681
And the petition review form, because I'm not sure I understand it, the petition review form addresses the deficiencies the department identified as their rationale for denying the petition.

03:59:38.721 --> 03:59:45.505
So that would, in the way the language of your motion is right now, it would address that rationale as identified?

03:59:45.845 --> 03:59:47.386
I want to make sure I'm clear on that.

03:59:47.546 --> 03:59:51.087
You can say the petition review form is identified in the meeting agenda.

03:59:51.187 --> 03:59:52.988
It's the attachment one.

03:59:53.568 --> 03:59:54.509
Okay.

03:59:55.029 --> 03:59:55.369
Correct.

03:59:56.670 --> 03:59:57.830
That's what we're talking about.

03:59:58.250 --> 04:00:00.752
Okay, if that's what we're talking about, then I can support the motion.

04:00:00.852 --> 04:00:07.475
And I think for clarity for staff, we also think that there's a timeline for hiring the academic support provider.

04:00:08.355 --> 04:00:10.056
So we can, that would be helpful.

04:00:11.056 --> 04:00:23.039
That would be helpful and also if we are talking about showing improvement is there a timeline for when the board wants to see the school back before the board so we can show you where they are?

04:00:23.059 --> 04:00:24.919
A year is too soon.

04:00:25.479 --> 04:00:25.959
Two years?

04:00:26.519 --> 04:00:26.999
Two years.

04:00:28.100 --> 04:00:34.381
And to access the support provider within the next three months or six months?

04:00:36.837 --> 04:00:39.359
Maybe before the start of the next school year.

04:00:40.060 --> 04:00:44.343
Before the start of their academic school year.

04:00:44.363 --> 04:00:44.343
1920.

04:00:44.463 --> 04:00:48.246
I would say by October so that people have a chance.

04:00:48.366 --> 04:00:49.126
By October 1.

04:00:49.226 --> 04:00:50.487
Catch up with themselves, yeah.

04:00:53.049 --> 04:00:54.170
Okay, by October 1.

04:00:57.952 --> 04:01:01.673
Yeah, we're having this very friendly friendly amendment session at the moment.

04:01:01.693 --> 04:01:18.437
I know I don't know if anyone typed it up You can try to take notes to read it So this is what I think Lisa make sure we move to approve the Los Angeles International Charter High School for grades 912 with the following conditions the petition will revise to reflect the SPS authorizer and

04:01:19.775 --> 04:01:25.738
and include the necessary language specified in the department's petition review form as identified in the meeting agenda.

04:01:26.418 --> 04:01:33.441
The charter will develop a plan to improve student academic performance, including mathematics.

04:01:35.462 --> 04:01:37.683
The plan will identify a support provider.

04:01:37.703 --> 04:01:39.304
Academic support provider.

04:01:39.324 --> 04:01:48.808
An academic provider agreeable to the state board executive director, who will assist with the strategic planning and implementation throughout the renewal term,

04:01:49.588 --> 04:01:51.131
This will be identified by October 1, 2019.

04:01:56.327 --> 04:01:59.988
The support provider will be identified by October 1, 2019.

04:02:00.468 --> 04:02:05.929
And what was the... And then come back in two years.

04:02:06.149 --> 04:02:09.850
Okay, was there anything about assignment monitoring or is that covered within our usual?

04:02:10.550 --> 04:02:10.770
Okay.

04:02:11.350 --> 04:02:13.131
We'll do that every two years.

04:02:13.651 --> 04:02:19.412
CD staff will provide an update to the board within two years of the status.

04:02:20.192 --> 04:02:20.692
Is that right?

04:02:21.213 --> 04:02:22.233
Is that what you want an update on?

04:02:22.453 --> 04:02:22.933
Okay.

04:02:24.079 --> 04:02:25.620
to see what the academic performance is.

04:02:25.680 --> 04:02:29.022
Okay an update on the academic performance in two years.

04:02:29.902 --> 04:02:31.963
We have all the features of the motion.

04:02:33.164 --> 04:02:35.485
We have a motion and a second.

04:02:35.885 --> 04:02:36.065
Yes.

04:02:36.265 --> 04:02:37.866
We've had discussion on the motion.

04:02:38.987 --> 04:02:42.368
I'm gonna call for the vote.

04:02:42.388 --> 04:02:43.449
I'm calling for the vote.

04:02:43.469 --> 04:02:45.210
Superintendent has a comment.

04:02:47.140 --> 04:02:53.767
Madam President and members of the board, we understand your intended direction with this motion.

04:02:53.787 --> 04:03:07.021
I would like to ask if we could also, if you all would be willing to make a statement of intention so that it isn't just waiting until October to have the provider in place.

04:03:07.461 --> 04:03:12.925
But that sooner than that, the school would have identified a plan for improvement.

04:03:13.685 --> 04:03:26.935
And the reason I'm asking that you suggest sooner is that if they have trouble getting the plan in place, that we would rather know that sooner rather than later so that we can assist them and provide technical assistance.

04:03:27.695 --> 04:03:39.642
As it currently is now, to be honest, the staff at the CDE, as it relates to the oversight of the state board schools, at best can do one visit per year.

04:03:40.303 --> 04:03:49.628
And so if it's already been identified that there are performance concerns, we would wanna know sooner what their plan is and where they need help sooner so that we could assist.

04:03:49.788 --> 04:03:53.390
And so- We may wanna say as soon as possible and no later than.

04:03:58.454 --> 04:03:59.200
Thank you Madam President.

04:03:59.381 --> 04:03:59.663
Thank you.

04:04:02.051 --> 04:04:03.212
One last comment before we go.

04:04:03.272 --> 04:04:11.117
And let me say I appreciate the superintendent for making that statement, especially given what the annual LCAP approval cycle is.

04:04:12.078 --> 04:04:21.364
The charter itself already has to get their approval done by the end of June so they can submit their plan to the county office or their authorizer by July 1st.

04:04:21.744 --> 04:04:24.626
So that pulls us into this conversation anyway.

04:04:24.686 --> 04:04:28.889
So there should be some intentionality on what they're going to be submitting to you

04:04:29.449 --> 04:04:33.411
as the new authorizer when they submit their LCAP to you as the new authorizer.

04:04:33.751 --> 04:04:40.755
So we should see something sooner, as soon as that, because they have to do their revised LCAP plan and turn that into you.

04:04:40.775 --> 04:04:45.878
So we don't even see the corrections we've identified, like they put the LPAC in instead of the CELP.

04:04:46.218 --> 04:04:56.927
when they turn their new LCAP into you on July 1st, that lets us know, well, we still have a problem with the urgency that they are taking to address the conditions we've put in.

04:04:56.987 --> 04:05:08.257
So I would make sure that you tell them, these are some things, at a minimum, we would like you to make sure you revise and submit in your LCAP when you turn it in on July 1st.

04:05:08.317 --> 04:05:13.662
I don't know if we need to put that in the motion, but it's very clear that that's gonna be the first immediate step.

04:05:14.172 --> 04:05:19.454
I think we can offer that as guidance, and I think the motion is pretty full of words.

04:05:21.575 --> 04:05:24.717
So we have a motion, we have a second.

04:05:24.797 --> 04:05:27.398
Hearing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.

04:05:28.038 --> 04:05:28.158
Aye.

04:05:28.598 --> 04:05:29.619
Any opposed say nay.

04:05:31.060 --> 04:05:31.780
Any abstentions?

04:05:32.620 --> 04:05:33.721
All right, motion passes.

04:05:35.041 --> 04:05:36.002
I'm gonna bang the gavel.

04:05:47.877 --> 04:05:48.777
I'm going to go on to item 17.

04:05:48.817 --> 04:05:56.702
Let's clear the room and then we can.

04:06:16.880 --> 04:06:19.141
We appreciate your enthusiasm.

04:06:19.181 --> 04:06:27.266
We do have to go on with the meeting so if you can celebrate in the hall that would be a better place.

04:06:37.451 --> 04:06:38.171
Take it outside.

04:06:41.213 --> 04:06:46.096
And in just a moment I'm going to recognize our state superintendent for a little

04:06:47.313 --> 04:06:48.554
Statement announcement.

04:06:51.735 --> 04:06:55.436
And by the way, I hope your daughter's 13th birthday got off to a good start this morning.

04:06:57.297 --> 04:06:57.357
Yay.

04:06:59.718 --> 04:07:00.218
Terrific.

04:07:04.140 --> 04:07:04.680
I know.

04:07:04.700 --> 04:07:10.182
I want to make a comment about how much gray hair and how much hair I have left.

04:07:10.342 --> 04:07:11.943
As she points out, not much.

04:07:15.783 --> 04:07:16.764
Just wait, just wait.

04:07:16.804 --> 04:07:17.964
Thank you, Madam Vice President.

04:07:19.305 --> 04:07:36.995
As you all prepare to give your reports, we would be remiss if we did not acknowledge that this is likely the last board meeting for our Deputy Superintendent, Tom Adams, and we would not want him to leave this meeting without being roasted, I mean acknowledged.

04:07:38.736 --> 04:07:44.499
I've got to work on my talking points for his long-standing service here at the department.

04:07:45.299 --> 04:07:55.144
You all know that he has most recently served as a deputy superintendent for the branch that has programs like special education and English language learners and

04:07:55.724 --> 04:08:17.700
nutrition and other things, he has extended his retirement through the end of June to assist us during a period of transition and has been filling in as the deputy superintendent of the branch that includes assessment and data and measurement that was previously headed by Carrick, who also recently retired.

04:08:18.140 --> 04:08:18.901
We thank him for that.

04:08:19.281 --> 04:08:26.466
What you may not know is that his journey at the Department of CDE has run continuously some 22 years.

04:08:26.706 --> 04:08:26.967
Wow.

04:08:27.347 --> 04:08:41.557
That he came to the department as a consultant in 1997 and has risen through the ranks and served in a number of capacities as a director and as a deputy superintendent.

04:08:43.678 --> 04:08:54.326
I've only had the last five months with him, but I can tell you he's someone with a lot of experience, wisdom, and knowledge who is deeply committed to young people.

04:08:54.526 --> 04:09:06.335
If you didn't know that, if you needed any more proof of that, he has served and continues to serve as a school board member in the Davis Unified School District.

04:09:06.415 --> 04:09:10.258
And he's given me the honor of swearing him in in his most recent term.

04:09:11.579 --> 04:09:18.328
I think that the school board member and being a state board member, I think it is the hardest job in politics.

04:09:18.488 --> 04:09:19.068
I really do.

04:09:20.150 --> 04:09:22.433
Because people mostly show up when they're angry.

04:09:23.995 --> 04:09:27.219
And when great things happen, sometimes the chamber is quiet.

04:09:27.819 --> 04:09:38.624
But I also think it is the most rewarding job that there is in the political environment and in an educational environment, to be able to set policy and direction for students, to be able to interact with students.

04:09:39.144 --> 04:09:41.745
And Tom's heart is very much about the students.

04:09:42.245 --> 04:09:51.750
He went out and greeted some parents yesterday who spoke here at this microphone during some of the very difficult times.

04:09:52.070 --> 04:09:55.891
And he made it his point to go and greet them.

04:09:55.911 --> 04:09:57.112
I think he's a true reflection

04:09:57.652 --> 04:10:01.793
of a leader who gets that what we do is all about students.

04:10:02.414 --> 04:10:09.436
And I didn't want you all to not have the opportunity to share whatever you might want to share to Tom.

04:10:09.476 --> 04:10:12.717
Now, we're hopeful that we can get him to delay and defer again.

04:10:13.557 --> 04:10:24.444
He spent a little bit more time with us, but I'm sure that his family, his wonderful family wants more time with him, and maybe he wants more time to devote to his school board duties.

04:10:24.925 --> 04:10:34.831
So Tom, on behalf of all the staff at the department, our chief deputy superintendent, Lupita Cortez-Alcala, all of the deputy superintendents, the 1,500 staff here,

04:10:36.472 --> 04:10:41.976
the entire network of some 2,500 staff all across the state and all of our partners.

04:10:42.577 --> 04:10:43.638
Thank you for your service.

04:10:43.698 --> 04:10:46.560
Thank you for being a part of the CDE family.

04:10:46.900 --> 04:10:49.562
And congratulations on your approaching retirement.

04:11:00.170 --> 04:11:01.330
I would love to.

04:11:01.350 --> 04:11:03.332
I didn't know if I would have a chance.

04:11:04.113 --> 04:11:13.659
You know, I came to the department in 2003, and I always found Tom Adams as just super respectful and very professional.

04:11:13.759 --> 04:11:14.980
He knew his business.

04:11:15.060 --> 04:11:18.062
He knew curriculum frameworks, and I can always take him to the Capitol.

04:11:18.082 --> 04:11:19.063
I had no problem.

04:11:20.544 --> 04:11:23.785
with talking points, keeping them on message, or anything like that.

04:11:23.905 --> 04:11:32.489
He is truly loyal, but not just to this agency and to the people he's worked for, but to the students.

04:11:33.689 --> 04:11:38.051
I'm really proud not only to call him my professional colleague, but a friend.

04:11:39.612 --> 04:11:46.958
I grew up here, and he was always there to lend a hand, to give me advice, to help me.

04:11:47.198 --> 04:11:59.348
And I just want to tell you, Tom, personally, you have been one of the best people here at the department that have not only helped me, but really helped us do great things, and I'm sure that there's innumerable

04:12:01.090 --> 04:12:15.800
frameworks and standards, and now you're in assessment world, and that you have contributed to, and you have personally contributed to and negotiated and probably been deposed one too many times over, I don't know, little things like history.

04:12:17.762 --> 04:12:28.809
So I just want to thank you for sticking with it and helping us out and helping me out yet again and this administration, but I just have so much deep respect for you and so much,

04:12:29.890 --> 04:12:36.503
love and kindness and and I will forever thank you and remember you for your for your kindness and your help.

04:12:36.843 --> 04:12:37.124
Thank you.

04:12:44.568 --> 04:12:54.254
Okay, so I just wanted to add that, yeah, so despite Tom being a board member and deputy superintendent and all those other things, he never left the classroom.

04:12:54.894 --> 04:12:57.876
And I saw that when he came and visited my school.

04:12:58.797 --> 04:13:07.082
And the light in his eyes, the energy he had, and the immediate connection that he had with students, I could tell he was still a teacher at heart.

04:13:07.722 --> 04:13:12.165
And that's really what energizes him and drives everything, and that's what we are about.

04:13:12.605 --> 04:13:13.446
So I just wanted to,

04:13:13.947 --> 04:13:15.454
to also highlight that about Tom.

04:13:20.785 --> 04:13:25.968
Well, I just want to express my congratulations on your retirement, Tom.

04:13:26.008 --> 04:13:27.428
We will definitely miss you.

04:13:28.309 --> 04:13:32.751
I've actually known Tom probably for all of the 20-some years that he's been at the department.

04:13:33.292 --> 04:13:35.933
And I just want to say that some of you know this.

04:13:35.973 --> 04:13:36.913
It was mentioned yesterday.

04:13:36.953 --> 04:13:49.000
When I came to be executive director of the state board when Superintendent Torlakson was still here, it's safe to say there was a little bit of a rocky history between the state board and the superintendent.

04:13:49.740 --> 04:13:54.242
And it was my goal to make sure that we didn't have that kind of relationship going forward.

04:13:54.302 --> 04:13:56.823
I know it was all of the board members' goal that as well.

04:13:57.363 --> 04:14:01.565
And one of my most effective partners in turning that around was Tom Adams.

04:14:02.665 --> 04:14:04.106
And Tom was fantastic.

04:14:04.686 --> 04:14:11.549
He held up the curriculum and framework division through very difficult times when we didn't have any money.

04:14:12.289 --> 04:14:15.651
He helped us point in the direction of the Instructional Quality Commission.

04:14:16.131 --> 04:14:18.892
And I think it's safe to say that our instructional

04:14:19.632 --> 04:14:29.427
and learning program in California would not be the same today if it were not for Tom Adams, and I will forever be grateful to you, and I hope that you get season tickets to the Giants.

04:14:37.136 --> 04:14:48.966
So I just want to say as a liaison to Instructional Quality Commission, I really got firsthand to watch Tom's leadership when he was, because he was Executive Director of the Curriculum Framework Division for 13 years.

04:14:49.307 --> 04:15:00.216
So what we saw as a result of the health framework work that we did yesterday, all the processes that the Curriculum Framework Division leads was developed under Tom.

04:15:01.397 --> 04:15:13.343
It's all the background work of how you track public comments, how you go through materials review, what the criteria is, how you bring people on, how you orient the Instructional Quality Commission.

04:15:13.583 --> 04:15:15.744
All that is really to Tom's credit.

04:15:16.104 --> 04:15:21.307
And I watched him very, very closely, as many of us have, on the different frameworks, as we did quite a few together.

04:15:21.327 --> 04:15:26.330
And Tom has a particular expertise in history social science, which was definitely

04:15:27.450 --> 04:15:42.538
And so, I would say that as we look back, because we had a five-year hiatus during the recession where we didn't do any frameworks, and then what we were able to do under Tom's leadership and the processes that we now deal, we deliver,

04:15:43.318 --> 04:15:44.559
Really, it's to your credit.

04:15:44.599 --> 04:15:48.422
But beyond that, it's just the collaborative, cooperative work we've done together.

04:15:48.522 --> 04:15:59.411
Tom and I sat on a panel with the deans of the schools of education, and Tom, with all his wisdom, said, in your courses for teacher preparation, why aren't you just using our California frameworks?

04:15:59.691 --> 04:16:07.562
They're free, they're online, and I think I just sat next to Tom so proud as a panel member talking about what we need to do to prepare teachers.

04:16:07.622 --> 04:16:16.254
So thank you for all your impact and leadership, but your legacy really is there and lead on in all of our work, and it's been our pleasure, really, my pleasure.

04:16:20.919 --> 04:16:27.281
Well, Mr. Dr. Adams and I met just in 2015 when I was appointed.

04:16:27.421 --> 04:16:30.682
And I have to say that, well, now we're Facebook friends.

04:16:30.702 --> 04:16:32.322
So I think we're at another level now.

04:16:34.463 --> 04:16:35.744
But I just have to say, you're funny.

04:16:37.384 --> 04:16:38.665
in a very quiet way.

04:16:38.685 --> 04:16:43.287
You're a very caring person, and that just comes across.

04:16:43.647 --> 04:16:47.149
And I think for me, you're so approachable and accessible, right?

04:16:47.169 --> 04:16:50.070
And I think not just for us, but just to your staff.

04:16:50.130 --> 04:16:56.854
Obviously, the room is, as we introduce this or as superintendent introduced, I started seeing people coming in.

04:16:57.194 --> 04:17:00.896
So that's a testament to your leadership and the type of person that you are.

04:17:01.576 --> 04:17:06.338
Thank you for being so involved in everything that has to do with English learners in particular.

04:17:06.358 --> 04:17:10.020
I have to say that I don't only see you in Sacramento, right?

04:17:10.180 --> 04:17:13.762
If I'm in San Francisco for a conference on ELLs, you're there.

04:17:13.842 --> 04:17:16.463
If I'm in Long Beach for a conference on ELLs, you're there.

04:17:17.103 --> 04:17:30.477
And so it's probably not surprising when people are involved in something that pertains to this building, but when they really care about a student population, when they care about an issue, they go beyond the boundaries of this building, and you've done that.

04:17:30.857 --> 04:17:36.042
So thank you for bringing voice and visibility to some of our students that are often not at the table.

04:17:36.583 --> 04:17:36.823
Thank you.

04:17:39.349 --> 04:17:44.891
Well, Thomas, I started my work in doing this policy work the same time you did.

04:17:44.931 --> 04:17:52.455
And the first time we met, we were at a meeting concerning the criteria for the English learner materials.

04:17:53.095 --> 04:17:55.056
And Jackie Goldberg was the convener.

04:17:55.851 --> 04:18:00.796
So we've been on this journey and on this conversation for a very long time.

04:18:01.297 --> 04:18:07.584
I don't have to worry about repeating the flowers and the accolades and the attaboys that you've heard from my colleagues.

04:18:08.084 --> 04:18:12.609
I just want to tell you, as an English teacher, you know me,

04:18:13.610 --> 04:18:20.460
Rudyard Kipling wrote in the poem, If You Can Keep Your Head About You When Others Around You Are Losing Theirs.

04:18:21.281 --> 04:18:27.409
I had a student who got so emotional in saying that poem, he said, then maybe you just don't understand the situation.

04:18:28.126 --> 04:18:39.472
But that's the one thing, every time, from the moment I met Tom at that first meeting with Jackie Goldberg, that was the voice and the poem and the thought that came to my mind.

04:18:39.492 --> 04:18:40.632
I have seen you laugh.

04:18:41.152 --> 04:18:42.133
I've seen you cry.

04:18:42.153 --> 04:18:49.396
I have seen you work to build consensus in a room full of people who just weren't interested in agreeing with anybody.

04:18:49.977 --> 04:18:52.558
I've seen you play charades badly.

04:18:52.578 --> 04:18:56.240
Nevermind charades.

04:18:57.679 --> 04:19:14.673
But more importantly, I have seen you walk the talk, not only with us as board members, but with your staff in the way you lead, in the way you guide, in the way you mentor, but with stakeholders in the way you lead, in the way you guide, in the way you mentor.

04:19:15.114 --> 04:19:18.937
People don't just respect you, they admire you.

04:19:19.437 --> 04:19:25.903
And my members, when I go into meetings and I mention your name, the whole room goes, ooh,

04:19:28.317 --> 04:19:48.672
because they really appreciate not only how you made them, how you do the work and how you validate the initiatives of what it is you're giving to them, but the fact that they know you were the one person who not only heard them, but you understood them and you gave action to their concerns.

04:19:49.132 --> 04:19:54.776
So even though you have little teeny tiny feet, you're leaving really big shoes to fill.

04:19:58.840 --> 04:20:15.395
You're leaving some really, really big shoes to fill because it's very hard to come in behind someone who has done this work as well as you have, not because it can't be done, but because there's just going to be a disappointment because it's not you who's still doing it.

04:20:15.795 --> 04:20:16.716
So even though

04:20:17.156 --> 04:20:29.882
You're going to be gone and even though I know you're leaving us in very capable hands because you have mentored some very strong leaders in this department and you have created a role model for how to do it well, you will be missed.

04:20:30.362 --> 04:20:33.904
I personally will miss you and I have your phone number so I can call.

04:20:34.304 --> 04:20:41.227
Not only I have your phone number and I know where you live, plus I've met your wife and she likes me so I know it'll be okay for me to come and visit.

04:20:42.941 --> 04:20:48.247
Before we close, I have something I'd like to say as well, but I don't know if any of the department staff has snuck in here.

04:20:48.307 --> 04:20:52.712
We're particularly interested in making any statement.

04:20:54.134 --> 04:20:55.556
I thought you might, Kristen.

04:20:56.857 --> 04:20:58.259
You just had that look about you.

04:20:58.939 --> 04:21:03.224
Well, as I have mixed feelings, because

04:21:05.359 --> 04:21:18.734
Tom is no longer my deputy, but during the time that Tom was, I have to say, and even before that, we have really been working hard in the state to really become more of a coherent system.

04:21:18.934 --> 04:21:24.441
And the only way we do that is by having great partners and great leaders who understand that from the core.

04:21:25.001 --> 04:21:40.184
And I guess that's what I would say in terms of reflecting not only about just a personal relationship with Tom, that he's been an incredible mentor and friend, but also that he's really helped our system to integrate in the ways that we'd always hoped it would, that general ed, special ed crossover.

04:21:40.684 --> 04:21:41.644
So thank you.

04:21:42.125 --> 04:21:43.285
We're going to miss you around here.

04:21:43.665 --> 04:21:45.485
I'm not going to say more because I'm going to start crying.

04:21:45.985 --> 04:21:49.166
And so thank you for letting me have this opportunity to say that.

04:21:53.803 --> 04:22:09.733
I want to just kind of close us off, as I was thinking about you Tom and you know what could be said about your leadership I was remembering a quote which I've just called up from Congressman Gus Hawkins who was, you know, a long time ago the father of Title One and

04:22:10.954 --> 04:22:13.274
one of our great Congress people from California.

04:22:14.135 --> 04:22:30.678
And he said, the leadership belongs not to the loudest, not to those who beat the drums or blow the trumpets, but to those who, day in and day out, in all seasons, work for the practical realization of a better world, those who have the stamina to persist and remain dedicated.

04:22:31.458 --> 04:22:34.459
And I think that's you, and we really appreciate you, Tom.

04:22:35.679 --> 04:22:36.239
Don't retire.

04:22:47.690 --> 04:22:54.575
Well first of all people will really swoon when my CDE the movie is done and George Clooney plays me.

04:23:12.097 --> 04:23:13.539
I think we're both a lot alike.

04:23:17.644 --> 04:23:18.726
I mean that modestly.

04:23:24.212 --> 04:23:33.458
I have to say, though, when I came to CDE, there's a couple things I always say to people.

04:23:33.798 --> 04:23:44.986
The first thing, I had moved from the world of academic research, doing a history dissertation involving four different languages, French, German, Polish, and English.

04:23:45.366 --> 04:23:51.210
So when I came here and started reading the code in English, my first reaction was, wow, this will be a lot easier.

04:23:54.852 --> 04:23:58.313
And then, so I thought I was pretty hot.

04:23:59.713 --> 04:24:06.475
And then the person who taught me how to read the Ed Code was Sandy Adams-Jones.

04:24:06.575 --> 04:24:10.957
She was a person in CFIR, a great person, recently passed away.

04:24:11.637 --> 04:24:13.838
But she had no more than a high school education.

04:24:16.098 --> 04:24:20.382
But she knew the Ed code and taught me how to read it and the subtleties of it.

04:24:20.522 --> 04:24:23.805
And here was someone with a PhD going, oh.

04:24:24.966 --> 04:24:29.709
And so it was an early lesson in my career that you can learn from everyone in the department.

04:24:30.930 --> 04:24:33.693
And I can say, Kristen, thank you.

04:24:33.713 --> 04:24:35.794
You taught me so much about special ed.

04:24:36.655 --> 04:24:40.178
Veronica Aguila, who taught me a lot about English learners.

04:24:41.359 --> 04:24:49.829
And there are other folks along the way, all the great staff in CD, and also the commissioners.

04:24:51.110 --> 04:24:54.934
It was called the Curriculum Commission and the Instructional Quality Commission.

04:24:56.375 --> 04:25:12.120
They were great in terms of enriching my perspective and it kind of reminds me of, you know, what I like to do on my spare time is read, join this reading group and we do it over the phone.

04:25:12.320 --> 04:25:15.321
It's called the Reading Odyssey and we read classical texts.

04:25:15.401 --> 04:25:19.023
It's the only way I've ever would have finished these studies or, yeah.

04:25:20.623 --> 04:25:24.385
I mean, I really have to ask someone saying, you know, we're going to talk about this, right?

04:25:24.505 --> 04:25:25.826
Oh, yeah, I better finish reading it.

04:25:27.887 --> 04:25:32.290
But anyway, so this spring we read Cicero's On Obligations.

04:25:33.611 --> 04:25:39.635
And people always say, well, you know, compliance and accountability, those tend to be bad words.

04:25:39.715 --> 04:25:41.376
But if we actually rephrase it,

04:25:42.256 --> 04:25:45.077
in the concept of renewing our obligations.

04:25:45.677 --> 04:25:49.559
And here is something telling us we need to be doing something about it.

04:25:50.719 --> 04:25:52.680
And maybe we're not doing it well.

04:25:53.960 --> 04:25:56.721
So that's why I took that inspiration.

04:25:57.362 --> 04:26:00.983
Anyway, Cicero talks about goodwill in there.

04:26:01.003 --> 04:26:06.705
And one thing is he talks about goodwill as not measured by intensity.

04:26:06.845 --> 04:26:08.666
He says that's a mistake of teenagers.

04:26:09.566 --> 04:26:14.250
Goodwill is measured by steadiness and commitment.

04:26:14.270 --> 04:26:19.055
And we know in the education business, it doesn't all happen in one day, right?

04:26:19.956 --> 04:26:23.719
We say at a minimum, it takes 180 days in this state.

04:26:24.379 --> 04:26:34.649
And we also know that many of you in your capacity as teachers, there's always a student who comes back to you five, 10 years later and says, you know what?

04:26:35.652 --> 04:26:41.856
I wasn't very good in your class, but this one thing stuck with me, and it really helped me out later.

04:26:42.497 --> 04:26:43.958
So it's part that.

04:26:44.518 --> 04:26:54.305
And it's also the sense, there's another great part where he refers to a Greek philosopher, Aeneas, who says,

04:26:57.503 --> 04:27:02.867
If you have a lamp that is lit and you light another, it doesn't mean your lamp is that much less.

04:27:03.527 --> 04:27:05.328
You have made the room that much brighter.

04:27:06.469 --> 04:27:08.550
And that's really what we're all about, right?

04:27:09.050 --> 04:27:18.176
We're about making the room brighter, making sure that when they leave the room, that they can take that lamp with them and light that many more.

04:27:18.416 --> 04:27:20.258
And really, that's what education is about.

04:27:20.318 --> 04:27:25.481
It's about lighting those lamps and making sure that others can enjoy that.

04:27:27.743 --> 04:27:34.469
You know, looking back on my career, I had a lot of great opportunities and privileges and so many things to learn.

04:27:35.010 --> 04:27:39.955
I started as a contract employee under the Honig administration.

04:27:40.815 --> 04:27:43.078
Yeah, yeah, I know.

04:27:43.098 --> 04:27:45.240
I really am from the previous century.

04:27:47.883 --> 04:27:52.310
And then Delane Easton, who happened to end up later in life as my neighbor.

04:27:53.631 --> 04:28:00.581
Jack O'Connell, and then Tom Torlakson, and then now Superintendent Thurman.

04:28:02.043 --> 04:28:03.204
It's amazing.

04:28:03.625 --> 04:28:06.808
It's a great thing to be in.

04:28:06.828 --> 04:28:16.437
And it's really nice when a job well done is measured by how well your students are doing.

04:28:18.359 --> 04:28:24.404
There's not too many other places in our economy where that's how you measure your job.

04:28:25.951 --> 04:28:27.372
And that's pretty rewarding.

04:28:27.432 --> 04:28:30.374
And that's why we keep doing this work.

04:28:30.434 --> 04:28:31.575
Yeah, it's never easy.

04:28:32.656 --> 04:28:37.460
But if it wasn't a good thing to be done, then we wouldn't be here, right?

04:28:38.120 --> 04:28:39.081
So thank you, everyone.

04:29:04.258 --> 04:29:05.300
You have to go to item 17.

04:29:05.500 --> 04:29:07.104
But go to item 17 we must.

04:29:07.164 --> 04:29:07.805
Thank you, Tom.

04:29:14.918 --> 04:29:17.720
So we are almost at the end.

04:29:19.062 --> 04:29:25.667
State Board Projects and Priorities, which is here for action and information.

04:29:27.208 --> 04:29:33.854
The SBE staff recommends that the SBE approve the preliminary report of actions and minutes for the March 13th, 14th, 2019 meeting.

04:29:33.874 --> 04:29:34.614
Do we have a motion?

04:29:38.692 --> 04:29:39.433
I move approval.

04:29:40.673 --> 04:29:41.154
Thank you.

04:29:42.034 --> 04:29:42.855
Any discussion?

04:29:43.635 --> 04:29:45.917
All approve, say yes, yay.

04:29:46.557 --> 04:29:47.198
Any nos?

04:29:48.118 --> 04:29:49.359
All right, any abstentions?

04:29:50.640 --> 04:29:55.083
I was not here on March 13th, so I guess I should abstain from March 13th.

04:29:57.785 --> 04:30:00.307
And now we have SBA liaisons.

04:30:01.908 --> 04:30:02.908
Yeah, you should abstain.

04:30:02.928 --> 04:30:05.010
Yeah, because you weren't here.

04:30:05.580 --> 04:30:06.160
So you don't know.

04:30:07.581 --> 04:30:08.701
You don't know if it was accurate.

04:30:09.561 --> 04:30:15.323
All right, so we have two and a half abstentions.

04:30:17.323 --> 04:30:26.265
Okay, so we wanna hear from SBE liaisons who wanna report on their activities that are not related to any items on our agenda.

04:30:27.386 --> 04:30:28.466
And we'll start with Sue Burr.

04:30:29.918 --> 04:30:35.480
I'll just report briefly on the work of the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence, CCEE.

04:30:35.560 --> 04:30:37.181
We met on April 4th.

04:30:38.501 --> 04:30:43.863
As usual, we had a lot of very informative presentations about the work.

04:30:44.223 --> 04:30:49.865
The one I want to call out is we did a spotlight update on our professional learning network.

04:30:49.945 --> 04:30:55.147
Some of you may know that we fund in the neighborhood of 50 or so professional learning networks.

04:30:55.567 --> 04:30:58.449
and we had two of them come and make a presentation.

04:30:59.209 --> 04:31:00.329
They were very powerful.

04:31:00.810 --> 04:31:03.531
All of our meetings are streamed, so if you're interested in seeing it.

04:31:03.991 --> 04:31:20.980
But I just have to say that the thing that struck me the most was one of the professional learning networks is led by Butte County, and Butte County brought a principal from Paradise who continued to participate in the professional learning network despite the fact that he lost both his school and his house.

04:31:22.020 --> 04:31:27.663
So it gives you a sense of how powerful that experience is for principals learning from each other.

04:31:27.863 --> 04:31:31.345
So kudos to him and to Butte County.

04:31:32.605 --> 04:31:37.688
Our next meeting will be June 6th here in Sacramento.

04:31:37.728 --> 04:31:39.389
I think it might actually be at the department.

04:31:39.429 --> 04:31:39.869
I can't remember.

04:31:39.929 --> 04:31:42.490
We kind of alternate between here and SCOE.

04:31:43.151 --> 04:31:45.052
As always, everybody's invited to attend.

04:31:45.392 --> 04:31:45.712
Thank you.

04:31:49.893 --> 04:31:50.673
Yes, good afternoon.

04:31:51.073 --> 04:31:56.675
First, I would like to acknowledge something big that happened in the Oakland community recently.

04:31:56.835 --> 04:32:02.217
So on April 3rd, on 26th Avenue and Foothill, three people were struck by a hit and run.

04:32:02.617 --> 04:32:17.601
Alma Vasquez, a mother of three, and six-year-old son, Angel Garcia Vasquez, a kindergartner in International Community School, also known as ICS, as well as Jamie Garcia, Angel's uncle, and a newcomer student at Fremont High School.

04:32:17.981 --> 04:32:21.923
who's still in the hospital recovering, I wish him one hope he can recover soon.

04:32:22.724 --> 04:32:27.807
This impacted the whole community as we saw a family be killed and their members hurt because of their loss.

04:32:28.717 --> 04:32:29.898
This should have never happened.

04:32:30.619 --> 04:32:34.162
Angel is the second student to be killed in this school due to a hit and run.

04:32:34.963 --> 04:32:40.408
The first student, Anita, she was killed while some of my peers in my senior class were in elementary school.

04:32:41.069 --> 04:32:46.534
And my little sister and cousins go to the school, which shares the same campus as ICS.

04:32:46.714 --> 04:32:51.038
And so in my personal life, I saw my little sister be impacted by this death.

04:32:51.318 --> 04:32:52.439
She is only six years old.

04:32:53.220 --> 04:33:03.010
The whole community on the campus, which is ICS and TCN, as well as Jamie's school, Fremont High School, and the Oakland community in the whole, came together and marched.

04:33:03.570 --> 04:33:12.038
We marched for their lives and for the city of Oakland to put a light in the corner, where even Noel Gallo, the district board member for that area, came.

04:33:12.779 --> 04:33:17.063
And, you know, it was because Alma and her baby were killed, Angel Garcia.

04:33:18.024 --> 04:33:20.126
And so, however, this is a sad story.

04:33:20.846 --> 04:33:22.548
I'm way too familiar with these things.

04:33:23.408 --> 04:33:25.030
My community is way too familiar.

04:33:25.550 --> 04:33:30.034
Since I was young, I heard of people and my community members get killed and people I know personally.

04:33:30.674 --> 04:33:34.397
And these are stories that I wish and many of us here wish weren't real, but they are.

04:33:34.878 --> 04:33:36.099
And we need to acknowledge them.

04:33:36.759 --> 04:33:41.483
And I wanna ask that we give a moment of silence for Alma and Angel and everyone impacted by his death.

04:33:42.023 --> 04:33:42.143
So.

04:34:00.489 --> 04:34:00.889
Thank you.

04:34:01.690 --> 04:34:09.015
I want all of us to remember their names, Alma, Angel, and Jamie, because these are people we serve.

04:34:09.815 --> 04:34:21.823
Angel's a student that we all served before his life was taken away, and Jamie is a student that we are going to serve as soon as he gets out of the hospital, as well as their peers and their siblings who are going to this school still.

04:34:22.624 --> 04:34:30.289
Angel has an older brother who's in fifth grade, and has a little sister who's one year old, who we will be serving in the future, and I want to remember them too.

04:34:31.886 --> 04:34:41.750
So after hearing that story, my last two reports have been about things that impacted communities greatly, but I feel like it's very important because these impact our students.

04:34:43.110 --> 04:34:43.690
Now moving on.

04:34:44.151 --> 04:34:50.793
In Los Angeles, the LA Unified School Board voted to allow 16-year-olds to vote in their school board elections.

04:34:51.533 --> 04:34:55.635
This is exciting to hear and I look forward to how this impacts and continues in other districts.

04:34:56.375 --> 04:35:06.207
I'm not sure if everyone knows this, but Berkeley Unified actually allows 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds to vote for their school board elections, so I'm excited to see how that moves on to other communities.

04:35:07.108 --> 04:35:11.934
And I would also want to talk about a situation that happened in Vallejo that went viral.

04:35:12.054 --> 04:35:15.379
A student named Natalie Ramos in Jesse Bethel High School

04:35:15.859 --> 04:35:18.780
was the first Latina to be named as the school valedictorian.

04:35:19.240 --> 04:35:28.344
However, for the first time, all of a sudden, when she wanted to be valedictorian, the school wanted to give the title to nine other students with her for the first time ever.

04:35:28.824 --> 04:35:43.229
When the original policy states that only one student was supposed to be valedictorian, and so she posted this on Twitter, her sisters and her mother, and it went viral all over Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, thousands and thousands of people across the country were sharing it.

04:35:43.809 --> 04:35:47.470
So after a few days that it went viral, her GPA all of a sudden got lowered.

04:35:47.970 --> 04:35:50.871
And she got turned into third place so that she wouldn't be valedictorian.

04:35:51.311 --> 04:35:53.732
So she posted that along with the rest of her family.

04:35:54.853 --> 04:35:59.834
And so because it went viral, she got put back to rank one because they're like, this is too much attention.

04:36:01.094 --> 04:36:03.835
And I myself spoke with Natalie Ramos and her family.

04:36:04.456 --> 04:36:07.577
And I wanted to make sure they were OK because she's a student that I represent.

04:36:07.777 --> 04:36:11.538
And fortunately, after everything that happened, she will be

04:36:12.678 --> 04:36:14.300
the valedictorian on her own.

04:36:14.340 --> 04:36:18.563
I'm very happy to hear that, you know, as a fellow Latina, if you have a title, you deserve it, right?

04:36:18.603 --> 04:36:21.085
People shouldn't change it only because you're Latina.

04:36:21.106 --> 04:36:26.390
It doesn't matter your sexuality, gender, race, ethnicity, you should get that title.

04:36:26.870 --> 04:36:32.615
And so Natalie Ramos will be going to UC Berkeley next year, so I wish her luck, and I'm excited to see her thrive.

04:36:33.916 --> 04:36:41.821
Another thing I wanted to acknowledge is that in Oakland I attended two honor rolls, the Middle Eastern honor roll, which is the first one ever, and the 19th annual Latino honor roll.

04:36:42.261 --> 04:36:49.245
And there was also the second annual Asian Pacific Islander honor roll, and next Monday there will be the African American honor roll.

04:36:49.565 --> 04:37:01.011
And these celebrations are very important because we are highlighting students who are doing great academically, but not only that, we are telling students you do not have to shut down your culture, you don't have to reject your culture,

04:37:01.491 --> 04:37:06.335
and have to give up everything you're about in order to be successful in your community.

04:37:06.375 --> 04:37:14.602
So all these events, they always have people, alumni, they have people who do cultural performances, they have people who speak, and they all do things.

04:37:14.662 --> 04:37:17.544
And so I was the keynote speaker for the Latino Honor Roll.

04:37:17.564 --> 04:37:18.485
It was a huge honor.

04:37:19.005 --> 04:37:26.351
And I was also a guest speaker for the Middle Eastern Honor Roll, which is very exciting because it's the first ever, and I'm excited to see how it moves on the next year.

04:37:26.591 --> 04:37:30.955
And another student who spoke is a senior at Life Academy High School, Mohamed Alolefi,

04:37:31.335 --> 04:37:52.430
who spoke about the importance of Middle Eastern culture and acknowledging it and acknowledging the diversity and how it has contributed to society and so it was really amazing and Latino honor roll we gave specific awards to two students I want to highlight Jovanna Salana who spent much of her time in speech therapy and special education classes from kindergarten to eighth grade.

04:37:53.010 --> 04:37:59.732
With perseverance and hard work, she made valiant strides to remove some obstacles in her way that stood in her way.

04:38:00.493 --> 04:38:09.316
Little by little, she made progress and built a community of teachers, therapists, and counselors that provided her with guidance, and support, and motivations to excel in her studies.

04:38:09.796 --> 04:38:19.159
And Giovanna actually became the first student to be reclassified as a student with IEP in Oakland Unified School District in her freshman year.

04:38:19.759 --> 04:38:25.902
And in her freshman year, she started A through G. And next year, she will be heading to East Bay College University.

04:38:25.942 --> 04:38:27.702
And so I'm very excited to see her thrive.

04:38:28.083 --> 04:38:33.325
And we also acknowledge Aparicio Lorenzo, who's an amazing student leader, a newcomer from Guatemala.

04:38:33.765 --> 04:38:36.586
He was our parliamentarian for All-City Council Student Union.

04:38:36.966 --> 04:38:40.108
And he will be going to UC Berkeley next year.

04:38:40.708 --> 04:38:43.249
And so I'm very excited to see Aparicio thrive as well.

04:38:43.469 --> 04:38:44.670
And yeah, that concludes my report.

04:38:44.690 --> 04:38:45.090
Thank you.

04:38:55.090 --> 04:38:56.050
No, I survived.

04:38:56.070 --> 04:39:01.335
Thank you for making the transition well.

04:39:01.495 --> 04:39:10.682
And I want to thank Karen, Staff Walters, and the staff have made this transition and my helpful understanding as to what my role is in the process.

04:39:10.702 --> 04:39:11.663
So I appreciate it very much.

04:39:12.383 --> 04:39:13.304
Thank you for letting me be part of it.

04:39:18.338 --> 04:39:23.122
So you saw a lot of my reports yesterday with 211 public comment speakers.

04:39:23.182 --> 04:39:24.202
I'm the healthy ace on.

04:39:25.604 --> 04:39:28.406
And I think everything went well.

04:39:28.666 --> 04:39:30.407
So I appreciate everyone that came.

04:39:31.128 --> 04:39:34.711
I want to start with a really high note for me is Teacher Appreciation Week.

04:39:35.071 --> 04:39:38.134
And I'm very happy to report that I am married to a teacher.

04:39:38.154 --> 04:39:45.340
So I want to appreciate, for me, the best teacher in California, Mr. Robert Licon.

04:39:46.505 --> 04:39:48.847
who happens to be a Latino in elementary.

04:39:48.908 --> 04:39:51.331
And I know that's one of the superintendent's initiatives.

04:39:51.751 --> 04:39:56.938
My husband is one of 7%, I believe, elementary school teachers.

04:39:57.538 --> 04:40:00.582
And he came to this field a little bit out of...

04:40:01.463 --> 04:40:03.624
Well, he wanted to be a pediatrician.

04:40:03.844 --> 04:40:05.884
That was his life goal since he was a young boy.

04:40:06.545 --> 04:40:09.826
And OCAM did not help at UCLA.

04:40:09.886 --> 04:40:22.230
So like most first generation Latino students, he was not encouraged to persist, and instead ended up in sociology, but had a love for science and a love for kids, and thought that he would bring those talents to the elementary school.

04:40:22.670 --> 04:40:23.790
And he was also a young father.

04:40:25.811 --> 04:40:28.974
Sometimes we don't choose a career, but the career chooses us.

04:40:29.475 --> 04:40:31.977
And he's been faithful to that career for 21 years.

04:40:32.638 --> 04:40:38.383
And he will be recognized by Assemblymember O'Donnell as Teacher of the Year for our district.

04:40:38.403 --> 04:40:39.905
So I'm very excited, yeah.

04:40:41.311 --> 04:40:45.355
Yes, and also just kudos and celebrations for all the teachers.

04:40:45.515 --> 04:40:49.719
It is the toughest but most rewarding job that we have in career.

04:40:51.140 --> 04:40:52.481
OK, so liaison assignments.

04:40:52.721 --> 04:40:56.204
I'm also the liaison for the ethnic studies model curriculum.

04:40:58.506 --> 04:41:03.670
I forget the name of our group, but our committee has just completed their third meeting.

04:41:04.211 --> 04:41:06.653
The model curriculum will now be going to the IQC.

04:41:07.233 --> 04:41:14.199
So that will be that process that will now be followed, and I am sure I'll be coming back to you with a lot of reports about the model curriculum.

04:41:15.280 --> 04:41:30.735
As EL liaison for the state board, I spoke at the California Association of Bilingual Educators along with Mr. Dr. Adams and I also sat on a panel with Lupita.

04:41:31.295 --> 04:41:35.378
and Dr. Daisy Gonzalez from the chancellor's office.

04:41:35.558 --> 04:41:37.340
I know Tom was there to support us.

04:41:37.360 --> 04:41:45.606
There was two men, Tom was one, and everybody else was women because it was women leadership in education.

04:41:45.946 --> 04:41:57.896
So that was a great opportunity to learn a little bit more about Lupita and her journey through the educational system and some of the things that she does now in her leadership at the State Board or at the department.

04:41:58.977 --> 04:42:09.707
I also want to thank State Superintendent Thurmond who will be visiting Long Beach Unified School to celebrate the dual emergent program and that will be happening June 7th.

04:42:09.848 --> 04:42:14.552
So we are very appreciative and honored that you've accepted the invitation to come to Long Beach Unified.

04:42:14.853 --> 04:42:15.113
Thank you.

04:42:22.057 --> 04:42:30.783
I'm also delighted to have survived and had this sort of first experience of the last two and a half days.

04:42:31.944 --> 04:42:36.127
Yeehaw.

04:42:36.527 --> 04:42:48.175
Actually, I'll build on one thing that Hema was talking about earlier, which is there has been an incredible amount of violence, I think, that so many kids throughout California have been

04:42:48.915 --> 04:42:49.476
dealing with.

04:42:49.736 --> 04:43:04.207
I think the current events that you were describing in your own neighborhood and what we heard earlier during the conversation that the kids at the high school witnessed someone actually killed in front of their high school.

04:43:05.168 --> 04:43:10.852
And then also, of course, having in the immediate rearview mirror the gun violence in Colorado.

04:43:12.313 --> 04:43:29.298
And just acknowledging that our kids come to schools with so much trauma and the degree to which we are both asking educators to heal our kids as well as teach our kids, and that is a big load to carry.

04:43:31.218 --> 04:43:46.998
that I'm delighted that we're appreciating teachers this week and recognizing them, not just for the academic work they do, but also the work that is much more close to familial love than what we oftentimes think of as at the forefront of their work.

04:43:49.744 --> 04:44:13.013
in the spirit of also thinking about love, both my mom and my husband's mom are both educators, and so today is actually my mom's birthday, and I know she's gonna be listening on public access, so I just wanna say happy birthday, mom, as well as happy appreciation of Teacher's Day, and the last sort of work-relating thing I'll just flag is that today is an important day for me,

04:44:14.313 --> 04:44:29.754
legal folks tell me if I'm not allowed to talk about political things but today is may revise budget day and it's very exciting that the governor has Proposed a I think a newfound importance for early learning for our overall system of support for learning and

04:44:30.094 --> 04:44:39.246
starting in the 0 to 5, acknowledging the connections with the state board, and also with our school systems, which provide so much of the backbone of early learning already.

04:44:39.346 --> 04:44:41.429
So I'm excited that is moving forward.

04:44:41.549 --> 04:44:43.071
And happy May revise.

04:44:43.132 --> 04:44:44.033
We have lots of revenue.

04:44:49.827 --> 04:44:57.872
Well first, taking a moment of personal privilege, earlier this week I acknowledged the contribution of one of my own teachers, Angela Tolson.

04:44:58.292 --> 04:45:01.534
I want to acknowledge two others, Ted Sanders and Arthur Prince.

04:45:02.114 --> 04:45:07.297
These two men were African American educators who chose to teach in an elementary school

04:45:07.857 --> 04:45:16.226
and give up professional options to be an engineer or to work in science because they wanted to teach and have the opportunity to teach.

04:45:16.707 --> 04:45:20.991
They're important to me not because they were my teachers, but because they were my brother's teachers.

04:45:21.672 --> 04:45:22.313
It is true.

04:45:22.893 --> 04:45:32.721
that African American boys need role models and need important role models and relationships with the people who stand in front of their classrooms to teach them.

04:45:33.141 --> 04:45:38.745
And my brother thrived as a student and as a man because of the relationship he had with those two people.

04:45:39.146 --> 04:45:40.747
So I want to make sure I acknowledge them.

04:45:42.142 --> 04:45:56.908
I'm the liaison for waivers, so for most of you, that's really dull and mundane, not really exciting stuff, but that's the reason I rely on and get a chance to work very closely with a lot of staff in this building to do that work.

04:45:56.988 --> 04:46:04.031
Every waiver in the state of California, except for class size, comes across my desk and we have a long conversation

04:46:04.511 --> 04:46:21.036
in preparation for the things that you take two minutes to vote on, not even two minutes to vote on, but I want to thank the staff for the diligence and the initiative that they show, not only in preparing the items, but in the research and the outreach and collaboration with the districts they work with.

04:46:21.536 --> 04:46:32.762
But in the time that I have spent, as you saw over these two days, we need to do some work on updating the policies that guide the decisions that we make on the waivers.

04:46:32.822 --> 04:46:41.927
And so this is something that I'm going to be working with the staff to undertake and to make sure that over time I'll come back and report to you

04:46:42.347 --> 04:46:46.788
some of the work that we're working on in doing some of those things.

04:46:46.948 --> 04:46:59.352
The other two things that I work on as a liaison, I'm going to rely on my colleague, Board Member Sion, Board Member Strauss to report on, so I will leave that to them, but I do want to close with one other report.

04:46:59.773 --> 04:47:03.974
You may recall we had a student member who came from Palos Verdes High School.

04:47:05.054 --> 04:47:15.077
As you see from each of the student board members we have, and especially the one we have here, each of them leaves a fingerprint, an imprint on this board and on the work that they have done.

04:47:15.517 --> 04:47:19.818
And one of the things that he left behind was a relationship with this board.

04:47:20.319 --> 04:47:28.341
Each year the PTA and the school site council at his high school does the fundraising to allow a group of juniors and seniors

04:47:28.681 --> 04:47:31.644
to have a multi-day field trip to Sacramento.

04:47:32.004 --> 04:47:35.367
They get to visit with their representatives in the Assembly and in the Senate.

04:47:35.848 --> 04:47:38.350
And this year, they even got an appointment with the speaker.

04:47:38.450 --> 04:47:42.234
I still wanna know how they did that, because I can't get an appointment with them.

04:47:42.774 --> 04:47:52.083
But as part of that relationship, and as part of their annual visit, I'm always invited to participate in a Q&A session with those students.

04:47:52.103 --> 04:47:54.105
And we get to talk about education policy,

04:47:54.545 --> 04:47:58.850
They ask me questions about the activities of the board and the work that's going on in Sacramento.

04:47:59.250 --> 04:48:05.697
And these are very well-informed individuals, and they're always very excited to come to Sacramento and do that work.

04:48:06.077 --> 04:48:08.499
I had an opportunity to meet with them again this year.

04:48:08.920 --> 04:48:15.667
It's a wonderful thing to see and to know we have wonderful individuals who come and sit on our board.

04:48:16.107 --> 04:48:26.259
It's another thing to see that the districts where they come from are expanding the opportunities for a lot of students to be engaged and continue doing that good work.

04:48:26.339 --> 04:48:31.726
So we're the beneficiaries of that particular relationship and so I'm always very happy

04:48:32.086 --> 04:48:47.231
to represent the board when those students from Palos Verdes High School come and I'm looking they've already asked me to hold my calendar for their field trip when they come here next year as well so I want to thank them but I also want to acknowledge Hema

04:48:47.951 --> 04:48:57.337
One of the things we take for granted when we are leaderships and in the work we do, that sometimes we suffer the slings and arrows of a great deal of abuse.

04:48:57.417 --> 04:49:02.241
And as the point was made, people don't always come here when they're in a good mood.

04:49:02.321 --> 04:49:04.062
They come here to yell at us.

04:49:04.582 --> 04:49:12.588
I think I want to give just a particular shout out to Hema because she's learned some of the hard lessons of leadership and about criticism.

04:49:13.268 --> 04:49:17.571
And the fact that sometimes that criticism comes from people who should know better.

04:49:18.251 --> 04:49:19.632
and who should behave better.

04:49:19.652 --> 04:49:27.697
It's always shocking and is always of a surprise, but I just want to say, Hema, we got your back.

04:49:28.517 --> 04:49:36.722
And for all the students who come here to this boardroom and to these meetings who choose to be brave and to stick their neck out and to stand up

04:49:37.343 --> 04:49:38.245
and to advocate.

04:49:38.265 --> 04:49:48.486
I applaud them and they are truly my individual heroes, but Hema, you in particular, are my personal hero and I really want to make sure I get a chance to say that to you.

04:49:54.362 --> 04:49:57.245
So I'm going to try to highlight a few of the liaison areas.

04:49:57.405 --> 04:50:12.137
One is I liaison to Credentialing Commission and I just want to highlight, those are a two-day meeting, but I just want to highlight a couple areas that particularly relate to teacher preparation and issues that we talk about in our goals of improving student achievement.

04:50:12.977 --> 04:50:15.439
Quite a debated and

04:50:16.780 --> 04:50:21.744
advocate discussion about the reading instruction competency assessment called the RICA.

04:50:22.725 --> 04:50:29.230
Very strong, it's an outdated teacher performance expectation that's based on legislation.

04:50:29.250 --> 04:50:38.137
There's pretty strong a desire by most people to do an update and to take a look at whether course requirements and a new

04:50:38.917 --> 04:50:45.902
an appropriate way of showing reading preparation that's aligned to our adopted standards rather than the old ones.

04:50:45.942 --> 04:50:54.387
So we'll hear some more about it, but CTC, you heard a lot of discussion, and there seems to be an agreement that this needs to be addressed.

04:50:54.427 --> 04:50:55.347
So I thought I'd bring that up.

04:50:55.668 --> 04:51:06.615
Also, so we got the benefit of the former CTC chairman, Linda Darling-Hammond, to be our state board vice president, and so there's a new CTC commission chair, and that's Dr. Tina Sloan,

04:51:07.375 --> 04:51:10.138
who's been on CTC for 11 years, delightful.

04:51:10.218 --> 04:51:12.281
She does teacher education at UC Santa Barbara.

04:51:12.641 --> 04:51:20.531
She was appointed by Governor Newsom to the higher ed seat and now has been elected unanimously as the chair, so very fortunate.

04:51:20.611 --> 04:51:26.418
She has 11 years of experience on CTC and I think will be a great chair, so delighted.

04:51:27.198 --> 04:51:29.940
And then we talked about the state-funded grant program.

04:51:29.960 --> 04:51:42.389
So under Governor Brown, there'd been money for trying to look at preparation, recruitment, retention, and support for California teachers, particularly in the area of special education, teacher residency, and grants to support that.

04:51:42.429 --> 04:51:46.952
And so we have a lot of agencies and districts and start charters looking at residency programs.

04:51:46.992 --> 04:51:51.536
And so they'll be really trying to look at preparation and developing the pipeline.

04:51:51.556 --> 04:51:53.457
So I thought I would share with that.

04:51:53.557 --> 04:51:54.258
And then also,

04:51:54.983 --> 04:52:03.412
The Career Tech Ed area where we talked about in the College and Career Indicator, there's a work group that talked about some updates on that as well, so we'll hear some more.

04:52:03.452 --> 04:52:15.164
So those are some highlights, lots of discussion at CTC, but those are things that are actually related directly to credentialing and things that affect the work that we do, although teachers affect everything we do.

04:52:16.267 --> 04:52:32.802
I was very fortunate to be on a panel, LA Unified is a large school district with a huge number of women leaders and they have annual conference with women leaders and actually Wes Smith from AXA facilitated a wonderful panel around the voice of women leaders and advocacy and I was very fortunate.

04:52:32.822 --> 04:52:35.204
It was held at Garfield High School, I'm actually really close to.

04:52:36.346 --> 04:52:39.889
Yeah, it was really fun and exciting opportunity.

04:52:40.570 --> 04:52:43.813
And then we talked a bit, Sue was talking about the professional learning network.

04:52:43.873 --> 04:52:50.639
So I got to speak after CTC here in Sacramento at the CSBA has a professional learning network.

04:52:50.699 --> 04:52:55.604
And so there's groups of superintendents with board members and district and the teams that come together

04:52:56.104 --> 04:53:01.287
We talked about the dashboard, the update, the idea of community engagement, and also the issue on capacity.

04:53:01.347 --> 04:53:03.108
How do you build capacity and stay focused?

04:53:03.628 --> 04:53:09.311
Really engaging conversation, the superintendents and their board members really talked about what is community engagement.

04:53:09.351 --> 04:53:13.694
And so just the idea of the work we do here at the policy level and watching how it's engaged.

04:53:14.386 --> 04:53:20.788
And I was fortunate on April 22nd to go to the CORE advisory, and Matt's been part of that program for a long time.

04:53:20.828 --> 04:53:24.669
But CORE is actually a group of eight districts, and it's actually 10 years old.

04:53:24.689 --> 04:53:25.469
It was established in 2010.

04:53:25.649 --> 04:53:28.270
It has large school districts.

04:53:28.370 --> 04:53:39.634
And so just an interesting thing, because I think they're a really good incubator for the work that we do around strategic use of data, bridging research policy and practice, and looking at improvement knowledge.

04:53:39.674 --> 04:53:40.654
And so just to highlight,

04:53:40.974 --> 04:53:46.378
And then there's some links on their website I'm glad to share, but I think they really can help inform some of our work.

04:53:47.659 --> 04:53:51.142
Talking about equity, talking about districts collaborating together.

04:53:51.162 --> 04:53:57.347
And so there was a panel from Sac City of principals talking about how they deal with continuous improvement at their school sites.

04:53:57.727 --> 04:54:00.469
And then a district team that talked about how they support principals.

04:54:00.589 --> 04:54:08.275
Obviously my role having served in both those roles and coaching principals and district leaders now, how do you give support for the people out on the line every day?

04:54:09.295 --> 04:54:11.277
So they have some really interesting things.

04:54:11.317 --> 04:54:18.080
So one thing, as we look at our dashboard, we're talking about being prepared, highly prepared, what that would look like.

04:54:18.341 --> 04:54:21.562
So they have some interesting titles that they capture.

04:54:21.723 --> 04:54:25.285
Post-secondary competitive is the highest level.

04:54:25.305 --> 04:54:26.365
That's what they call it.

04:54:26.765 --> 04:54:34.530
Then they say, then you're post-secondary promising, high school graduation ready, vulnerable, or at risk.

04:54:34.710 --> 04:54:39.493
Just interesting to think about as far as how they categorize it and what categories they use.

04:54:39.533 --> 04:54:51.361
They use a lot of different data systems and they have a really interesting program looking at freshman success and really looking at what that means and using lots of analytics.

04:54:52.762 --> 04:54:58.985
the freshman on track program that they're doing and some of the metrics could be helpful and informative as we look at what is good.

04:54:59.406 --> 04:55:02.227
Those of us who've lived in high schools, what are good high school practice?

04:55:02.247 --> 04:55:04.808
How do you catch kids before they get too far behind?

04:55:05.209 --> 04:55:08.030
What kind of analytics in transition from eight to nine?

04:55:08.130 --> 04:55:10.211
What are relationships and things that matter?

04:55:10.571 --> 04:55:19.376
So, I know the core districts are doing some really wonderful work that I think are really helpful and they are part of our stakeholder groups just so you're aware of, so they do share some of their practice.

04:55:20.276 --> 04:55:23.698
Then I'm part of the Standard Steering Implementation Committee.

04:55:23.738 --> 04:55:32.524
It's really a dozen of us from CDE, state board, and the county superintendent's office talking about where are we on standards implementation.

04:55:33.344 --> 04:55:36.446
So two communities of practice that are worth thinking about.

04:55:36.486 --> 04:55:38.187
They got private funding from Bechtel.

04:55:38.667 --> 04:55:39.588
over a four-year period.

04:55:39.608 --> 04:55:42.549
They're only a year from finishing and WestEd's been studying it.

04:55:42.609 --> 04:55:46.031
But it was a model to try to build capacity across our counties.

04:55:46.391 --> 04:55:48.272
So they have regional teams that come together.

04:55:48.372 --> 04:55:55.596
They meet three times a year for a couple days, build their learning with the understanding they have to go back to their county offices and their counties and try to improve.

04:55:56.196 --> 04:56:10.008
So, it was a slow process to get started building regional capacity, but there's WestEd's finding some interesting promising practices, but they talk about the stuff we talk about, which is equity and access, support for students with disability, particularly area of science.

04:56:10.388 --> 04:56:16.013
They actually use Sanger to take a look at their work with universal design for learning and NGSS.

04:56:17.054 --> 04:56:18.755
All those resources are available.

04:56:18.795 --> 04:56:24.420
So, I just thought it'd be interesting and be aware that there was a science community practice and a math community of practice,

04:56:24.824 --> 04:56:26.865
They have another year before the grant ends.

04:56:26.925 --> 04:56:34.509
So over the four years, Bechtel will have put $10 million into expanding capacity for math and science.

04:56:34.649 --> 04:56:39.131
And still, we're taking a look at and we're starting to touch classrooms.

04:56:39.211 --> 04:56:41.612
How are we helping to build that capacity?

04:56:41.712 --> 04:56:42.873
So really important.

04:56:42.893 --> 04:56:49.676
The last thing is the Standards Steering Implementation Committee, which met last week, is talking about how do we sustain this over time?

04:56:49.696 --> 04:56:50.937
What's the role of the leads?

04:56:51.397 --> 04:56:53.858
What's the role of principal support out there?

04:56:53.998 --> 04:56:55.318
What's best first instruction?

04:56:55.358 --> 04:56:57.179
How do we help that standards-wise?

04:56:57.619 --> 04:57:00.900
And how does system of support differentiate classroom support?

04:57:00.940 --> 04:57:13.345
So there's a lot of work and I think trying to get a sense of this giant state and how we support standards implementation, how do we build capacity from pre-service to different stages of people's career and the leaders to support it.

04:57:13.605 --> 04:57:15.965
There's a lot of discussion that's going on.

04:57:16.186 --> 04:57:17.346
So that ends my report.

04:57:24.065 --> 04:57:24.646
I'll be fast.

04:57:25.466 --> 04:57:30.911
So you all we had the item on the Perkins transition plan as you know.

04:57:31.792 --> 04:57:32.432
So that's passed.

04:57:32.492 --> 04:57:37.476
We will be oh sorry it's the workforce pathways advisory committee that I'm reporting on.

04:57:37.937 --> 04:57:40.979
We did have a meeting scheduled for April 22nd.

04:57:41.039 --> 04:57:44.342
Unfortunately we didn't have a quorum so we ended up not having that meeting.

04:57:44.742 --> 04:57:45.843
Our next meeting is May 29th.

04:57:46.864 --> 04:58:02.587
I'm also going to be attending the Board of Governors, community college Board of Governors meeting on May 21st to report out on the work of the joint advisory committee.

04:58:04.048 --> 04:58:05.429
And so that's that.

04:58:05.689 --> 04:58:24.781
Since it's teacher appreciation week and everybody else took personal privilege I'm just going to really quickly give a shout out to Mrs. Brimner who was my middle school English teacher who when the counselor tried to put me in remediation English because as some of you know I had EL problems when I was younger.

04:58:24.801 --> 04:58:25.502
What's that?

04:58:29.084 --> 04:58:38.392
restraints, that they tried to put me in the remedial English class and she insisted instead to put me in the accelerated English class and here I am today.

04:58:39.013 --> 04:58:54.707
So that, and then on the other end of that, just tonight I actually was very pleased to be invited by a former student at my school, Noel Mora, to speak at a student, at a panel around the LCFF and it's a student group

04:58:55.587 --> 04:58:57.208
that's interested in policy.

04:58:57.808 --> 04:59:01.190
And he sent me this email, I hadn't heard from him in three years.

04:59:01.590 --> 04:59:07.353
He sent me this email with this title, it said, President and CEO of the Associated Students, Inc.

04:59:07.794 --> 04:59:09.775
at Sacramento State University.

04:59:10.255 --> 04:59:12.876
So I was just quite impressed with that at all.

04:59:12.956 --> 04:59:14.257
So that's what I'll be doing tonight.

04:59:19.970 --> 04:59:24.854
In the spirit of recognizing teachers, I wanted to recognize three teachers.

04:59:25.094 --> 04:59:34.923
One I thought about when we were doing the health education framework yesterday was my kids' eighth grade health education teacher who taught them about sex education and drug education.

04:59:34.963 --> 04:59:37.185
And they call his name, Mr. Einhorn.

04:59:37.765 --> 04:59:41.889
To this day, they thank Mr. Einhorn for everything that he taught them.

04:59:42.549 --> 04:59:44.351
So I want to thank Mr. Einhorn.

04:59:46.132 --> 05:00:06.335
I've been reading a lot about the research that shows that African-American teachers are particularly important for the long-term success of African-American students, and two of my kids had the privilege of studying with Fay Freeman in the third grade, who was the motivator for everything that they did thereafter, and we saw that.

05:00:06.915 --> 05:00:13.378
in action and Fay Freeman and Evelyn Jenkins-Gunn who are both board certified teachers.

05:00:14.318 --> 05:00:34.246
Evelyn single handedly detract Pelham High School as an English teacher and made sure that all the kids were in the Regents classes and passed and they are heroes for us and our family and I think representative of the wonderful teachers we have in our country and in our state.

05:00:35.046 --> 05:00:40.900
So with that, we took public comment earlier and that, do we have any, are we done?

05:00:41.762 --> 05:00:44.268
All right, so I hereby adjourn.
