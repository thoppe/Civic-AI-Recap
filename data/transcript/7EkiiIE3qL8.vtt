00:00.000 --> 00:10.800
Good morning. Seeing that the board members are present, Brooks, can you please call the

00:10.800 --> 00:11.800
roll?

00:11.800 --> 00:14.800
Good morning. Member Bonanca.

00:14.800 --> 00:15.800
Here.

00:15.800 --> 00:16.800
President Darling-Hammond.

00:16.800 --> 00:17.800
Here.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.800
Member Escobedo.

00:19.800 --> 00:20.800
Here.

00:20.800 --> 00:22.800
Vice President Glover-Woods.

00:22.800 --> 00:23.800
Here.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.800
Member Lewis.

00:25.800 --> 00:26.800
Here.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.800
Member McQuillan.

00:28.800 --> 00:29.800
Here.

00:29.800 --> 00:32.800
Member Olken.

00:32.800 --> 00:33.800
Here.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.800
Member Roscoe-Gonzalez.

00:35.800 --> 00:36.800
Here.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.800
Member Petillo-Brownson.

00:38.800 --> 00:39.800
Here.

00:39.800 --> 00:42.800
Member Rodriguez.

00:42.800 --> 00:45.800
We have a quorum.

00:45.800 --> 00:52.800
Wonderful. I hereby call the July 2022 meeting of the State Board of Education to order at

00:52.800 --> 00:58.800
8.33 a.m. and I'd like to commence by saluting the flag. Member Bonanca, could you please

00:58.800 --> 01:01.800
lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance?

01:01.800 --> 01:05.800
Absolutely. Please stand for the pledge.

01:05.800 --> 01:14.800
Ready? Salute. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to

01:14.800 --> 01:20.800
the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and

01:20.800 --> 01:23.800
justice for all. Thank you.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.800
Thank you.

01:25.800 --> 01:37.800
And with that, I'm going to frame us up with some general announcements. The proposed waiver

01:37.800 --> 01:45.800
consent items are W1 through W19. The proposed regular consent items are items 6 through

01:45.800 --> 01:52.800
14. There are two public hearings on the agenda. Item 5 is the proposed formation of a new

01:52.800 --> 01:56.800
unified school district from the Northgate portion of the Mount Diablo Unified School

01:56.800 --> 02:02.800
District in Contra Costa County. Item 17 is the appeal of the denial of a petition for

02:02.800 --> 02:07.800
the establishment of a classroom-based charter school pursuant to California Education Code

02:07.800 --> 02:14.800
Section 47605K2. Consideration of the allegations of abuse of discretion made by Samoa Beach

02:14.800 --> 02:19.800
Academy, which was denied by the Northern Humboldt Union High School District and the

02:19.800 --> 02:26.800
Humboldt County Board of Education. We have some changes in the agenda. We will reopen

02:26.800 --> 02:33.800
item 1, SBE priorities, later this afternoon to take action on the May 2022 minutes and

02:33.800 --> 02:40.800
take up state board liaison reports. In terms of public input, members of the public wishing

02:40.800 --> 02:44.800
to call in for public comment should view the livestream of the meeting to know what

02:44.800 --> 02:50.800
time public comment will occur for each item. Public comment may be provided by dialing

02:50.800 --> 02:54.800
the phone number, entering a participant access code, and then following each of their

02:54.800 --> 03:01.800
operator's prompts. Upon dialing in, callers will be added to a caller queue. The operator

03:01.800 --> 03:06.800
will notify callers when it is their turn to provide public comment. We'll also ask

03:06.800 --> 03:11.800
callers to please turn down the speaker volume of their computers if they are following the

03:11.800 --> 03:16.800
live webcast to avoid an echoing effect. Public comment will be limited to one minute for

03:16.800 --> 03:22.800
each speaker. Item 15 is the general public comment item during which members of the public

03:22.800 --> 03:27.800
may provide comment on matters that are not specifically listed on the board's agenda.

03:27.800 --> 03:32.800
Board members, please mute your microphones when not speaking and keep your cameras on

03:32.800 --> 03:37.800
at all times except during the scheduled breaks to ensure that we maintain a quorum throughout

03:37.800 --> 03:44.800
today's virtual meeting. If you do need to take a modest break, please feel free to do so,

03:44.800 --> 03:52.800
but keep with us every time that you can. For each item on the agenda, there will be an

03:52.800 --> 03:56.800
opportunity for the board members to raise their Zoom hand if they would like to ask a question

03:56.800 --> 04:02.800
or make a comment. That's in the participant reactions that I will be watching for your hands.

04:02.800 --> 04:08.800
Item one is our state board projects and priorities item. I'll now turn it over to State

04:08.800 --> 04:13.800
Superintendent Tony Thurman to provide his report. Superintendent.

04:13.800 --> 04:17.800
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond. Good morning to you, to the members of the board, to our

04:17.800 --> 04:25.800
students, our educators, our families, and all who are participating in today's meeting. As we

04:25.800 --> 04:31.800
are in summer school and in the summer, I want to extend best wishes to all of our students and

04:31.800 --> 04:35.800
families. I also want to start by acknowledging our first responders and firefighters who are

04:35.800 --> 04:43.800
working across the state to contain many of the fires that we have seen in recent days and thank

04:43.800 --> 04:49.800
also our emergency response team that continues to work with our first responders in ways to

04:49.800 --> 04:54.800
support our school communities when they're impacted by our fires. Also want to provide

04:54.800 --> 04:58.800
acknowledgement and a shout out to all of our teachers and educators and administrators and

04:58.800 --> 05:04.800
others who are working in summer school, providing opportunities for credit recovery, learning

05:04.800 --> 05:09.800
recovery, expanded learning, recognizing the hard work that continues to take place in the incredible

05:09.800 --> 05:14.800
opportunity that summer provides, but the fact that many are still working and want to acknowledge

05:14.800 --> 05:20.800
them and thank them. I do want to provide you some highlights that since we last met, the

05:20.800 --> 05:27.800
legislature and the governor have finalized a budget. There are some incredible highlights for

05:27.800 --> 05:34.800
California education. As we reach this inflection point of building and better and building back

05:34.800 --> 05:39.800
from what the pandemic has created, our schools have tremendous opportunities to ensure that our

05:39.800 --> 05:45.800
students can recover, that they can heal, and that they can thrive moving forward. Not the least of

05:45.800 --> 05:53.800
which is an increase to the LCFF base by about $9 billion. This is a 13% increase in funding for

05:54.800 --> 06:02.800
our schools. They are receiving a cost of living adjustment. That's more than 6%. When you think

06:02.800 --> 06:08.800
about all these measures, including an $8 billion block grant that schools will be receiving for

06:08.800 --> 06:14.800
discretionary purposes to support literacy and expanded learning and other programs, it means that

06:14.800 --> 06:21.800
California schools are nearing being 10th in the nation in per pupil spending. Significant change

06:21.800 --> 06:28.800
for us considering just a few years California was near 50th. Our schools have incredible

06:28.800 --> 06:34.800
resources that they can use going forward to help our students heal and thrive. Just a few

06:34.800 --> 06:41.800
highlights of this, recognizing that students need more supports in counseling. Tremendous

06:41.800 --> 06:48.800
resources made available in this budget. You all know that we sponsored SB 1229 in our call to

06:48.800 --> 06:54.800
help us attract 10,000 new mental health clinicians to the field. We're grateful that the

06:54.800 --> 07:01.800
budget creates a pathway to provide $20,000 scholarships to anyone who will become a mental

07:01.800 --> 07:07.800
health clinician in a high needs community and that that money continues to be available for

07:07.800 --> 07:15.800
teachers and educators in addition to $250 million in residency programs to support them. I want to

07:15.800 --> 07:21.800
thank a lot of folks who have helped to make these things happen, including our state board president,

07:21.800 --> 07:27.800
Dr. Jarling Hammond, the governor, the legislature. You will see incredible resources like $250 million

07:27.800 --> 07:35.800
for literacy coaches and specialists to support students in schools of high need. Some $500 million

07:35.800 --> 07:41.800
for career technical education for those who want to learn and get on pathways in technology, health,

07:41.800 --> 07:47.800
education. Another $200 million to support our expansion of dual language immersion programs.

07:47.800 --> 07:53.800
$3 billion for expanded learning programs. Continuing to build on our universal meals programs,

07:53.800 --> 07:59.800
another $596 million to support universal meals. That means that there will be reimbursement rates to

07:59.800 --> 08:05.800
support our schools. There's another $600 million to help our schools build out their kitchens and

08:05.800 --> 08:11.800
their infrastructure so we can provide more healthy meals for our students throughout the state.

08:11.800 --> 08:17.800
$10 million for books and $15 million for professional development for our educators

08:17.800 --> 08:25.800
related to literacy. Another $1 billion for community schools. Again, I want to thank this board

08:25.800 --> 08:31.800
and for your incredible work to help us as we move forward. Thank you.

08:31.800 --> 08:37.800
And for your incredible work to help us as we rolled out the first round

08:37.800 --> 08:43.800
of community schools funding part of a $3 billion initiative and the recognition of the legislature

08:43.800 --> 08:49.800
and the governor that we need to continue to provide community schools. So another $10 million

08:49.800 --> 08:57.800
to build on the anti-bias grants that are currently being provided.

08:57.800 --> 09:03.800
What does this all mean? In spite of big challenges that our schools have faced over the last two years,

09:03.800 --> 09:09.800
the resiliency that our students and parents and educators have shown, California schools have the resources

09:09.800 --> 09:15.800
to help transform public education. As you can see here, California is leading the way with being able

09:15.800 --> 09:19.800
to provide universal meals for every hungry student regardless of their background.

09:19.800 --> 09:23.800
I want to thank the board and for your incredible work to help us as we rolled out the first round of

09:23.800 --> 09:27.800
community schools funding part of a $10 million initiative and the recognition of the legislature

09:27.800 --> 09:33.800
and the governor that we need to provide community schools, universal preschool, and our state

09:33.800 --> 09:39.800
community schools for professional development, a robust mental health program.

09:39.800 --> 09:47.800
So these are just a few of the highlights.

09:47.800 --> 09:53.800
Thank you very much for participating. Madam President, I would just like to leave you with this

09:53.800 --> 09:59.800
and let you know that there are two new division directors that will be presenting before this body from time to time.

09:59.800 --> 10:05.800
One, a very familiar face who will be taking over, has officially taken over

10:05.800 --> 10:11.800
of the educator excellence and equity division. That's Monique McWane who's been serving in the division

10:11.800 --> 10:17.800
who has served 11 years at CDE. We're grateful for her leadership.

10:17.800 --> 10:23.800
Many of you know her as someone who's helped to roll out the educator effectiveness grant

10:23.800 --> 10:29.800
billions to support professional development for educators on every topic that you can imagine

10:29.800 --> 10:35.800
from closing the opportunity gap to how we address bias in schools.

10:35.800 --> 10:41.800
We're grateful and excited to continue to work with Monique in this role and to announce

10:41.800 --> 10:47.800
a new director of the student achievement and support division.

10:47.800 --> 10:53.800
You will see Will McGee who has most recently served as the director of the

10:53.800 --> 10:59.800
Office of African American Male Achievement and will continue to lead the efforts of our

10:59.800 --> 11:05.800
student achievement and support division. Will has more than 25 years of

11:05.800 --> 11:11.800
experience in public education. He's a former school board member and another great addition to our team

11:11.800 --> 11:17.800
of division directors and so we look forward to when they'll be presenting before you. As always, I'm happy to submit

11:17.800 --> 11:23.800
any questions that the members of the board may have. This concludes my report.

11:23.800 --> 11:29.800
Thank you very much. Lots of good news to report there.

11:29.800 --> 11:35.800
I'll start my report by congratulating all of the educators, parents, and students across the state

11:35.800 --> 11:41.800
for the tremendous work they devoted to learning through another challenging year.

11:41.800 --> 11:47.800
As the pandemic has evolved into an endemic and we've had to adjust to changing circumstances on a regular basis,

11:47.800 --> 11:53.800
so many schools have done wonderful work in learning recovery. Many of them are still in session for summer

11:53.800 --> 11:59.800
programming in that regard, supports for social and emotional welfare, and rebuilding community.

11:59.800 --> 12:05.800
We appreciate you, all who are engaged in that difficult work.

12:05.800 --> 12:11.800
I want to give a special shout out to the graduates, our seniors, whose high school

12:11.800 --> 12:17.800
experience was really shaped by COVID and who persevered through all of that, but also

12:17.800 --> 12:23.800
I want to congratulate the eighth graders who have graduated, the fifth or sixth graders who stepped up to middle school,

12:23.800 --> 12:29.800
even the preschoolers who are stepping off to kindergarten.

12:29.800 --> 12:35.800
I was reminded of the significance of graduation when I attended my son's very long

12:35.800 --> 12:41.800
graduation ceremony from University of California at Berkeley for his doctoral program.

12:41.800 --> 12:47.800
As I was helping to try to keep my grandson, Kofi, engaged, he's three years old,

12:47.800 --> 12:53.800
he kept asking, what is graduation? What is graduation? I tried lots of different definitions,

12:53.800 --> 12:59.800
but being told that his father, it meant that his father would no longer have to go to school

12:59.800 --> 13:05.800
made him happy for a moment, but then when he realized that he too could graduate and would not be

13:05.800 --> 13:11.800
going to school someday, he was very sad about that. So graduation is a mixed bag,

13:11.800 --> 13:17.800
but there are millions of students who feel in California happy to be in school,

13:17.800 --> 13:23.800
and we are working towards the day when that is true for every single student in the state.

13:23.800 --> 13:29.800
The superintendent gave a wonderful report about the giant steps forward

13:29.800 --> 13:35.800
that we've had in support of our public schools this year with huge investments in local control funding formula,

13:35.800 --> 13:41.800
which over the last three years has been a 30% increase.

13:41.800 --> 13:47.800
We were well below the national average in spending on schools for many, many, many years.

13:47.800 --> 13:53.800
We are now finally above the national average and making progress towards a real

13:53.800 --> 13:59.800
whole child, whole school, whole community, whole state approach to education.

13:59.800 --> 14:05.800
You heard all of the details around that just a moment ago.

14:05.800 --> 14:11.800
I think that part of that message, as one of the reporters noted when the budget was announced,

14:11.800 --> 14:17.800
this is a once in a generation budget. We are trying to meet our students where they are

14:17.800 --> 14:23.800
and transform our schools through a student-centered lens, and we're working to rebuild and strengthen

14:23.800 --> 14:29.800
relationships between educators, students, and families, relationships that are at the heart of our work.

14:29.800 --> 14:35.800
This work is actually redefining education in this state and setting a national example

14:35.800 --> 14:41.800
of what a 21st century equity-informed system could look like.

14:41.800 --> 14:47.800
Indeed, today, Governor Newsom will accept an award on behalf of all of us for the

14:47.800 --> 14:53.800
Innovation in Education in the State from the Education Commission of the States,

14:53.800 --> 14:59.800
the Frank Newman Award. It's kind of like an Oscars for Education Policy with less of the drama,

14:59.800 --> 15:05.800
I presume. We'll hear more later. And in announcing the award, ECS said that

15:05.800 --> 15:11.800
California is, quote, demonstrating an intentional comprehensive investment of funding and other resources

15:11.800 --> 15:17.800
that recognize and honor whole child approaches to education, not only instruction.

15:17.800 --> 15:23.800
ECS pointed to our local control funding formula as one of the nation's most equitable formulas.

15:23.800 --> 15:29.800
They also called out the additional funding provided schools over the last three years for more teachers,

15:29.800 --> 15:35.800
counselors, paraprofessionals, our large investment to scale summer school, before and after

15:35.800 --> 15:41.800
school programming, our community school partnership program. And, of course,

15:41.800 --> 15:47.800
it does take a village to innovate and implement, so the Newman Award really recognizes

15:47.800 --> 15:53.800
everyone in our system who is doing this work. And speaking of the hard work that has been

15:53.800 --> 15:59.800
underway in the state, I want to congratulate the staffs of our state board, our Department of Education,

15:59.800 --> 16:05.800
our Commission on Teacher Credentialing, who have worked together so hard to provide our communities with

16:05.800 --> 16:11.800
meaningful data about teacher assignments in California. You may know that the teacher assignment

16:11.800 --> 16:17.800
monitoring data was posted last week. It got quite a few newspaper articles across the state.

16:17.800 --> 16:23.800
It actually required linking databases across agencies, undertaking a Herculean task,

16:23.800 --> 16:29.800
identifying every course or class being taught in the schools, then matching it to teacher credentialing

16:29.800 --> 16:35.800
information for every one of our 5.9 million students, and then sending all that information

16:35.800 --> 16:41.800
to the local level for investigation, corrections, and revising the data set in the response to that.

16:41.800 --> 16:47.800
And the results show that statewide, the large majority of courses and classes are taught by teachers

16:47.800 --> 16:53.800
who are fully certified for the content and the students they teach, about 83 percent.

16:53.800 --> 16:59.800
Among the remainder are teachers who are teaching out of field, still in training,

16:59.800 --> 17:03.800
or on various kinds of temporary or emergency permits.

17:03.800 --> 17:07.800
And the numbers of such teachers are much, much higher in low income schools.

17:07.800 --> 17:13.800
So there's an equity mission and agenda that accompanies the release of those statistics.

17:13.800 --> 17:17.800
Those statistics will soon find an annual home in the state data system.

17:17.800 --> 17:23.800
They are a useful benchmark. They flag that there is much work to be done.

17:23.800 --> 17:27.800
to address the long-term teacher shortage, which is a national phenomenon.

17:27.800 --> 17:31.800
We are not alone. This is something that's occurring across the country.

17:31.800 --> 17:35.800
And it was made worse by the pandemic.

17:35.800 --> 17:39.800
So Governor Newsom has started working on this issue as soon as he took office in 2019

17:39.800 --> 17:43.800
with investments in teacher and leader development.

17:43.800 --> 17:47.800
He and the legislature have been working each year to address the issue more fully.

17:47.800 --> 17:51.800
The budget in 2021 featured, as Superintendent Thurmond noted,

17:51.800 --> 17:57.800
$3.6 billion in multiple recruitment and retention initiatives

17:57.800 --> 18:01.800
that were aimed at increasing and supporting the well-prepared educator workforce

18:01.800 --> 18:05.800
by subsidizing preparations, supporting expert teachers

18:05.800 --> 18:09.800
who could mentor and coach beginners in high-need schools.

18:09.800 --> 18:13.800
And those programs are beginning to become more and more important.

18:13.800 --> 18:17.800
Over the last two years, we've seen a 20% increase

18:17.800 --> 18:21.800
in the number of people enrolled in teacher education

18:21.800 --> 18:25.800
after years and years of sharp decrease.

18:25.800 --> 18:29.800
And this past year, I'm told there's an even greater increase.

18:29.800 --> 18:33.800
I haven't seen the specific numbers yet.

18:33.800 --> 18:37.800
But we are drawing more people to the profession.

18:37.800 --> 18:41.800
We want to bring them in in ways that are effective.

18:41.800 --> 18:45.800
We want to bring them in in ways that are supported,

18:45.800 --> 18:49.800
where they can receive the mentoring and

18:49.800 --> 18:53.800
working condition supports that make it possible to do the job

18:53.800 --> 18:57.800
well and to stay in teaching.

18:57.800 --> 19:01.800
So we're pointed in some promising directions.

19:01.800 --> 19:05.800
There are still challenges to come.

19:05.800 --> 19:09.800
But with that, I look forward to the work that we will undertake

19:09.800 --> 19:13.800
in this meeting. One of the things on our agenda is

19:13.800 --> 19:17.800
looking at the accountability and indicator

19:17.800 --> 19:21.800
system in California, of which these new data will be a part.

19:21.800 --> 19:25.800
We undertook in the state to create a very

19:25.800 --> 19:29.800
at the time, a very unusual and innovative approach

19:29.800 --> 19:33.800
to indicators. You may recall, if you have a long

19:33.800 --> 19:37.800
enough memory, that there was an era where the only data that was

19:37.800 --> 19:41.800
used to identify schools and then kind of place them in

19:41.800 --> 19:45.800
a test and punish mode were test score data

19:45.800 --> 19:49.800
long before the federal government allowed for

19:49.800 --> 19:53.800
multiple measures. California went there anyway

19:53.800 --> 19:57.800
with our state priorities and with the development of the dashboard

19:57.800 --> 20:01.800
that really looks at things that have to do with what

20:01.800 --> 20:05.800
students are receiving in school in terms of the kind of

20:05.800 --> 20:09.800
curriculum opportunities, the kind of resources available,

20:09.800 --> 20:13.800
the kind of curriculum

20:13.800 --> 20:17.800
they're enabled to pursue, the kind of climate that they

20:17.800 --> 20:21.800
experience, as well as multiple indicators of what they

20:21.800 --> 20:25.800
have the opportunity to accomplish, including

20:25.800 --> 20:29.800
access to college preparatory curriculum

20:29.800 --> 20:33.800
and high quality CTE curriculum to

20:33.800 --> 20:37.800
literacy, to civic engagement, as well as

20:37.800 --> 20:41.800
to evidence of academic accomplishment through

20:41.800 --> 20:45.800
test scores, completion of rigorous courses like AP courses and

20:45.800 --> 20:49.800
IB courses and so on. We were the first

20:49.800 --> 20:53.800
state to really identify such an approach

20:53.800 --> 20:57.800
to take into account growth or progress as well as

20:57.800 --> 21:01.800
status. There's now a moment

21:01.800 --> 21:05.800
being invited by the US Department of Education for people to think

21:05.800 --> 21:09.800
even more deeply about how to use

21:09.800 --> 21:13.800
indicators, evidence, data in a cycle

21:13.800 --> 21:17.800
of continuous improvement. And we'll have a chance to undertake

21:17.800 --> 21:21.800
some thinking about that over the coming months beginning

21:21.800 --> 21:25.800
today. So with that, let's get to work. I

21:25.800 --> 21:29.800
want to move to the next item on the agenda, but I had to

21:29.800 --> 21:33.800
escape the leaf blow.

21:33.800 --> 21:37.800
Where they were, because now

21:37.800 --> 21:41.800
they're coming to another part of the house. So I can

21:41.800 --> 21:45.800
get us going on the next item. So give me one

21:45.800 --> 21:49.800
second to get myself relocated.

21:49.800 --> 21:53.800
If I didn't have my background on, you could get a tour of my house.

21:53.800 --> 21:57.800
Alright.

21:57.800 --> 22:01.800
So now that we've

22:01.800 --> 22:05.800
done our reports, I want to announce that we are going to

22:05.800 --> 22:09.800
honor a very important member of the state board staff for

22:09.800 --> 22:13.800
many years, Patricia Dacasse. Patricia is joining

22:13.800 --> 22:17.800
us via Zoom. There she is. Hello, how are you?

22:17.800 --> 22:21.800
Good to see you. Good morning, state

22:21.800 --> 22:25.800
board president. It's great to see you. Thank you.

22:25.800 --> 22:29.800
I want to announce that after more than 12 years

22:29.800 --> 22:33.800
of service to the state board of education, under three different administrations,

22:33.800 --> 22:37.800
over 30 years of state service, Patricia is retiring.

22:37.800 --> 22:41.800
Her last day in the office was June 15th. We have a certificate

22:41.800 --> 22:45.800
for Patricia that honors her contributions to the state board.

22:45.800 --> 22:49.800
We have a picture of that certificate, which is in front of you now.

22:49.800 --> 22:53.800
And it states, in recognition of outstanding service to

22:53.800 --> 22:57.800
the state board of education, I sincerely appreciate your dedication

22:57.800 --> 23:01.800
to the meaningful work we do on behalf of California's children

23:01.800 --> 23:05.800
on December 15th, 2009 to June 15th,

23:05.800 --> 23:09.800
2022. And so, of course, we'll mail the certificate

23:09.800 --> 23:13.800
to you, Patricia. Would you like to say a few words?

23:13.800 --> 23:17.800
Yes, thank you so much, President Darling-Hammond and

23:17.800 --> 23:21.800
Vice President Glover Woods,

23:21.800 --> 23:25.800
Superintendent. I just want to

23:25.800 --> 23:29.800
say that it's been an honor and a privilege to work with each

23:29.800 --> 23:33.800
and every one of you during the course

23:33.800 --> 23:37.800
of the last nearly 13 years. And

23:37.800 --> 23:41.800
you know, I learned so much from each and every one

23:41.800 --> 23:45.800
of you. I think that we are in a much better place in California as

23:45.800 --> 23:49.800
you know, your statement,

23:49.800 --> 23:53.800
both the superintendent's presentation as well as your

23:53.800 --> 23:57.800
statement this morning is a testament to how far we've come

23:57.800 --> 24:01.800
in the past many years. And

24:01.800 --> 24:05.800
in terms of our investments in education, it's been an honor

24:05.800 --> 24:09.800
to work with all of you and

24:09.800 --> 24:13.800
just to work with the staff as well as the support from the California

24:13.800 --> 24:17.800
Department of Education. Without our strong partnership with

24:17.800 --> 24:21.800
department staff, we would really, you know,

24:21.800 --> 24:25.800
we all are

24:25.800 --> 24:29.800
stronger by working together. So I just,

24:29.800 --> 24:33.800
you know, we laid a lot of foundational work

24:33.800 --> 24:37.800
in the last, you know, several years by developing new

24:37.800 --> 24:41.800
standards. I was involved in the development of the ELD standards

24:41.800 --> 24:45.800
as well as the California NGSS standards

24:45.800 --> 24:49.800
and seeing them through, through the assessments

24:49.800 --> 24:53.800
to strengthen the relationship between the teaching

24:53.800 --> 24:57.800
and learning experience for students. All of this is, you know,

24:57.800 --> 25:01.800
all of this work, you know, the history social science

25:01.800 --> 25:05.800
framework that I worked on and, you know, just seeing all of the different assessments

25:05.800 --> 25:09.800
get to where we are in terms of online assessments and

25:09.800 --> 25:13.800
you know, the work that I did for workforce issues

25:13.800 --> 25:17.800
and broadband on behalf of the administration.

25:17.800 --> 25:21.800
You know, I feel very honored to have had the opportunity

25:21.800 --> 25:25.800
to work with all of you and so

25:25.800 --> 25:29.800
you know, it's time to turn a new chapter

25:29.800 --> 25:33.800
as they say. And I know that I'm leaving the board

25:33.800 --> 25:37.800
in a, you know, all of you in a much

25:37.800 --> 25:41.800
we are all in a much stronger place than we were when I first arrived.

25:41.800 --> 25:45.800
So it's been a wonderful experience. Thank you so much.

25:45.800 --> 25:49.800
Well, we appreciate all that you've done and I know that travel is on your

25:49.800 --> 25:53.800
agenda in some exciting ways and we wish you all

25:53.800 --> 25:57.800
the best in this next chapter. Thank you. Thank you so much.

25:57.800 --> 26:01.800
And with that we're going to move to item two.

26:01.800 --> 26:05.800
Item two is the update on the implementation of the integrated local state

26:05.800 --> 26:09.800
and federal accountability and continuous improvement system. It's a

26:09.800 --> 26:13.800
study session for us on the development history implementation

26:13.800 --> 26:17.800
and indicators in the accountability system. This is an item

26:17.800 --> 26:21.800
for information only and there's no specific action

26:21.800 --> 26:25.800
recommended at this time. I mentioned

26:25.800 --> 26:29.800
in my president's report that there is a

26:29.800 --> 26:33.800
an opportunity at this moment to be

26:33.800 --> 26:37.800
thinking again about where we want to build on

26:37.800 --> 26:41.800
the work that's been done before and continue to

26:41.800 --> 26:45.800
think about what kinds of information in the

26:45.800 --> 26:49.800
accountability and indicator system will help schools

26:49.800 --> 26:53.800
get the knowledge that they need to continuously

26:53.800 --> 26:57.800
improve to engage with the support system.

26:57.800 --> 27:01.800
I mentioned that California was one of the first to engage in this approach

27:01.800 --> 27:05.800
to an accountability system. And in

27:05.800 --> 27:09.800
fact the Every Student Succeeds Act, the federal act

27:09.800 --> 27:13.800
that we now operate under, took a page out of

27:13.800 --> 27:17.800
California's book in authorizing multiple measures. The U.S. Department

27:17.800 --> 27:21.800
of Education just in February put out a

27:21.800 --> 27:25.800
statement, a guidance statement, indicating that they were open to

27:25.800 --> 27:29.800
states going further in

27:29.800 --> 27:33.800
looking at ways to evaluate, to

27:33.800 --> 27:37.800
support, to report on indicators

27:37.800 --> 27:41.800
of equity and access for students to high quality

27:41.800 --> 27:45.800
education. There were some rules that were in place

27:45.800 --> 27:49.800
from previous administrations that are not in the law that can be

27:49.800 --> 27:53.800
adjusted that will open the door for

27:53.800 --> 27:57.800
some new thinking around indicators. So we'll be having conversations

27:57.800 --> 28:01.800
over the coming months about where California is and wants to

28:01.800 --> 28:05.800
go in its work in this regard to support

28:05.800 --> 28:09.800
schools, to support students in ways that allow

28:09.800 --> 28:13.800
the system to improve. With that I'm going to

28:13.800 --> 28:17.800
pass the ball to Cindy Kazanis. Thank you

28:17.800 --> 28:21.800
President Darlene Hammond, Cindy Kazanis, the Director of the Analysis, Measurement

28:21.800 --> 28:25.800
and Accountability Reporting Division. And I am

28:25.800 --> 28:29.800
happy to be here today to talk through a couple

28:29.800 --> 28:33.800
of things around the dashboard. This is really meant to lay the foundation for future

28:33.800 --> 28:37.800
action the board will be taking over the next year

28:37.800 --> 28:41.800
or more to shape our accountability system.

28:41.800 --> 28:45.800
I am grateful for the team in putting this together. It's

28:45.800 --> 28:49.800
not the work of one person, it's the work of many. And in fact it's many

28:49.800 --> 28:53.800
divisions and we're really excited to have a new director of

28:53.800 --> 28:57.800
our title one division is what we used to

28:57.800 --> 29:01.800
call it and our acronym is SASD and I always forget

29:01.800 --> 29:05.800
what it stands for. But really excited to have Will

29:05.800 --> 29:09.800
here in person today to also listen to the item

29:09.800 --> 29:13.800
and to present. So you will hear more than just my voice this

29:13.800 --> 29:17.800
morning. You're going to hear multiple voices to help move this

29:17.800 --> 29:21.800
presentation along. So with that

29:21.800 --> 29:25.800
our objectives are really to give you an overview for how this system

29:25.800 --> 29:29.800
was built and also to review what the requirements were under

29:29.800 --> 29:33.800
the state and federal laws and President Darling-Hammond

29:33.800 --> 29:37.800
has already given you a brief overview about the context for

29:37.800 --> 29:41.800
the federal piece at least. We will also talk a little

29:41.800 --> 29:45.800
bit, we'll intersperse the conversation with the board action, prior board actions

29:45.800 --> 29:49.800
that is, around the methodology of this and such.

29:49.800 --> 29:53.800
And then finally we do value

29:53.800 --> 29:57.800
and we definitely respond and adjust things

29:57.800 --> 30:01.800
when we hear public input around the system. And so this system was built

30:01.800 --> 30:05.800
on the premise of public feedback and so you're going to hear about our continuous

30:05.800 --> 30:09.800
improvement cycle as well. So as far as topics

30:09.800 --> 30:13.800
again foundation, we're going to get into some broad

30:13.800 --> 30:17.800
overviews about the state indicators, our local indicators and we're going to talk a bit about

30:17.800 --> 30:21.800
our partner engagement and the annual review process.

30:21.800 --> 30:25.800
So in terms of the local control funding formula

30:25.800 --> 30:29.800
when I was in graduate school in the early 2000s

30:29.800 --> 30:33.800
at Syracuse there were people that were working on the getting down to fact

30:33.800 --> 30:37.800
studies and those getting down to fact studies really provided the basis in 2008

30:37.800 --> 30:41.800
for the local control funding formula and what you see in education today.

30:41.800 --> 30:45.800
And so I thought this quote was really a very good

30:45.800 --> 30:49.800
way to talk about what the intentions were of this law, how to bring

30:49.800 --> 30:53.800
government closer to the classroom where all the decisions really

30:53.800 --> 30:57.800
are made on a daily basis. You know putting out an accountability or dashboard

30:57.800 --> 31:01.800
once a year doesn't get into what's happening in the classroom on a daily basis.

31:01.800 --> 31:05.800
Where accountability is happening every day with a teacher, whether the teacher's

31:05.800 --> 31:09.800
taking attendance, they're learning about what their students are progressing

31:09.800 --> 31:13.800
on and so I think it's really important to just lead with

31:13.800 --> 31:17.800
that intention about how

31:17.800 --> 31:21.800
this main fundamental change is not only to policies around accountability

31:21.800 --> 31:25.800
but funding and transparency for education.

31:25.800 --> 31:29.800
So in that vein we're almost going to be at

31:29.800 --> 31:33.800
a decade celebrating this next year or at the end of

31:33.800 --> 31:37.800
the year with the local control, the LCFF

31:37.800 --> 31:41.800
or local control funding formula. And when I think back to 2013

31:41.800 --> 31:45.800
and the broad support it got not only in legislature but in

31:45.800 --> 31:49.800
our various communities

31:49.800 --> 31:53.800
that follow education and those that didn't follow education that do

31:53.800 --> 31:57.800
now as a result of LCFF, it really had broad-based support.

31:57.800 --> 32:01.800
One of the things that it required, one of the big lifts was that the State Board of Education

32:01.800 --> 32:05.800
was designated to develop a new accountability system.

32:05.800 --> 32:09.800
And this was replacing our old accountability system which was

32:09.800 --> 32:13.800
called the Academic Performance Index. And so

32:13.800 --> 32:17.800
this was really revolutionary for California looking at things beyond

32:17.800 --> 32:21.800
test scores. So we're going to talk through throughout this presentation about the emphasis

32:21.800 --> 32:25.800
on really a whole child approach and multi-points

32:25.800 --> 32:29.800
of information around student performance, student outcomes

32:29.800 --> 32:33.800
and how the system is ultimately supporting specific student

32:33.800 --> 32:37.800
groups, schools and districts.

32:37.800 --> 32:41.800
So the purpose of LCFF was really

32:41.800 --> 32:45.800
a three-prong approach. Looking at funding, making sure that we were distributing

32:45.800 --> 32:49.800
funding to schools equitably, making sure that the

32:49.800 --> 32:53.800
decisions that were made locally and the process that

32:53.800 --> 32:57.800
is outlined through the local control funding formula that Josh will talk about

32:57.800 --> 33:01.800
stays local. And then looking at our achievement

33:01.800 --> 33:05.800
and measuring it broadly. So beyond again our traditional look

33:05.800 --> 33:09.800
at student test scores.

33:09.800 --> 33:13.800
Shifting from the state law to federal

33:13.800 --> 33:17.800
law, nearly two years later the Every Student Succeeds

33:17.800 --> 33:21.800
Act was signed into law by then President Barack Obama.

33:21.800 --> 33:25.800
And I think too it's interesting to see again the intent of one of

33:25.800 --> 33:29.800
the main individuals behind the approval

33:29.800 --> 33:33.800
of this and who signed it into law, what they thought that the Every Student

33:33.800 --> 33:37.800
Succeeds Act was going to do and how it was going to change education.

33:37.800 --> 33:41.800
And so you can really see this focus on college, future careers,

33:41.800 --> 33:45.800
building upon prior reforms, but still holding

33:45.800 --> 33:49.800
to a high standard for teaching and learning, but also allowing states

33:49.800 --> 33:53.800
to have a bit of independence and making, holding

33:53.800 --> 33:57.800
states accountable for defining certain things such as

33:57.800 --> 34:01.800
how our teachers defined under what

34:01.800 --> 34:05.800
President Darling-Hammond just spoke about with our teacher data release. So with that in

34:05.800 --> 34:09.800
mind, I think it's also important to point out that

34:09.800 --> 34:13.800
there still is a focus on looking at our lowest performing schools

34:13.800 --> 34:17.800
and also paying attention to those achievement gaps and

34:17.800 --> 34:21.800
targeting funding accordingly.

34:21.800 --> 34:25.800
So again this bill was signed into law back in 2015.

34:25.800 --> 34:29.800
The board had yet another piece of accountability

34:29.800 --> 34:33.800
at its lap to figure out which was

34:33.800 --> 34:37.800
how to develop a state plan based on very extensive public input.

34:37.800 --> 34:41.800
And that effort was led by Barbara Murchison who has since retired from

34:41.800 --> 34:45.800
the California Department of Education. While the plan

34:45.800 --> 34:49.800
was developed over a multi-meeting process, multi-year

34:49.800 --> 34:53.800
process, it was ultimately approved back in July of 2018.

34:53.800 --> 34:57.800
And I have to tell you from a personal standpoint, we were one of the last

34:57.800 --> 35:01.800
states to be approved for our state plan. And that's because California,

35:01.800 --> 35:05.800
unlike other states, had already built an accountability system

35:05.800 --> 35:09.800
based on a local control funding formula that we were trying to fit into this

35:09.800 --> 35:13.800
federal system. And it took an in-person negotiation with the U.S.

35:13.800 --> 35:17.800
Department of Education with the former executive director, Ken Steph Walters,

35:17.800 --> 35:21.800
the former chief deputy, Glenn Price, myself and

35:21.800 --> 35:25.800
Dave Sapp, who was a legal counsel then, to the board to really

35:25.800 --> 35:29.800
persuade them that there were some things that they weren't

35:29.800 --> 35:33.800
understanding and how California's approach was different. And they were able to give on

35:33.800 --> 35:37.800
some things, but other things we did have to ultimately put in our system.

35:37.800 --> 35:41.800
And so we'll talk through a couple of those instances during our presentation

35:41.800 --> 35:45.800
today as well. So the other

35:45.800 --> 35:49.800
piece of the Every Student Succeeds Act is it did provide

35:49.800 --> 35:53.800
certain metrics that we needed to think about putting in our state plan. It wanted

35:53.800 --> 35:57.800
specifically around academic achievement, wanted to make sure that we

35:57.800 --> 36:01.800
include our graduation rates, which is of course really one of the bases

36:01.800 --> 36:05.800
for having a student level data system at the state level is to show

36:05.800 --> 36:09.800
longitudinally where a student has gone and if a student has left the system

36:09.800 --> 36:13.800
which school and district

36:13.800 --> 36:17.800
is attributed for that student leaving the system potentially not coming back and graduating

36:17.800 --> 36:21.800
on time. It also requires to look at

36:21.800 --> 36:25.800
growth or other indicators, so we'll walk through what that is, as well as progress

36:25.800 --> 36:29.800
in achieving English proficiency, which of course for California has been really a

36:29.800 --> 36:33.800
tenet of ours for decades. And so for us we really

36:33.800 --> 36:37.800
feel very strongly about that indicator and we've I think shown a lot of

36:37.800 --> 36:41.800
progress towards it. And then finally looking at

36:41.800 --> 36:45.800
valid, reliable, comparable statewide indicators, school quality, and

36:45.800 --> 36:49.800
finally the weight. And this is the weighting piece that I know that

36:49.800 --> 36:53.800
President Darling-Hammond was referring to that there's flexibility coming our way

36:53.800 --> 36:57.800
from the U.S. Department of Education around this. And so

36:57.800 --> 37:01.800
what does this look like moving forward? I think there's a lot of opportunities for conversation

37:01.800 --> 37:05.800
as we again continue to develop the

37:05.800 --> 37:09.800
system. So the local control funding formula in

37:09.800 --> 37:13.800
2013 laid out ten priority areas.

37:13.800 --> 37:17.800
And those priority areas we then mapped, actually

37:17.800 --> 37:21.800
WestEd was contracted to do some of the

37:21.800 --> 37:25.800
initial work along with Nancy Brunel from the State Board of Education

37:25.800 --> 37:29.800
at the time to really map out what would be an indicator

37:29.800 --> 37:33.800
that data could be collected at the state level or collected

37:33.800 --> 37:37.800
at the local level. And so this chart, I'm not going to

37:37.800 --> 37:41.800
list them all individually, but you can see at a glance how many of

37:41.800 --> 37:45.800
these pieces are still a local

37:45.800 --> 37:49.800
indicator. They still need to self-report this information. I should

37:49.800 --> 37:53.800
So we have the first three are all local indicators

37:53.800 --> 37:57.800
are all locally collected. They report on them. You're going to hear about this from

37:57.800 --> 38:01.800
Josh Strong in a bit. But when we switch over to state indicators

38:01.800 --> 38:05.800
that's information that is collected at the student, at every student

38:05.800 --> 38:09.800
for every grade. So the state is

38:09.800 --> 38:13.800
dependent on a local educational agency giving us this data

38:13.800 --> 38:17.800
certifying the data is accurate. And then we take the data

38:17.800 --> 38:21.800
and we make sure that the appropriate business rules have been applied and we

38:21.800 --> 38:25.800
report it out on the dashboard. So as an example, academic indicator

38:25.800 --> 38:29.800
we do get that information of course from our testing vendor, from ETS

38:29.800 --> 38:33.800
and we work with our assessments division on making sure that those

38:33.800 --> 38:37.800
data are valid and reliable. And then you can see the other

38:37.800 --> 38:41.800
indicators that have been mapped to each of the LCFF priority areas.

38:41.800 --> 38:45.800
Finally for the remaining ones, there is a combination

38:45.800 --> 38:49.800
for six around for state. We're able to collect suspension rates

38:49.800 --> 38:53.800
but at the local level we depend on

38:53.800 --> 38:57.800
local school districts to determine which is the best local climate survey to

38:57.800 --> 39:01.800
administer to their students and at their school sites.

39:01.800 --> 39:05.800
Finally we will go walk through the indicators

39:05.800 --> 39:09.800
a little bit more in depth in just a bit. But I wanted to make sure I

39:09.800 --> 39:13.800
mentioned the last two indicators, nine and ten, are specific to county offices of

39:13.800 --> 39:17.800
education. So often times you'll hear that we have eight local indicators

39:17.800 --> 39:21.800
we really have ten but they only apply to again our

39:21.800 --> 39:25.800
county offices of education. So those are around coordination of services

39:25.800 --> 39:29.800
for expelled students and the same for our foster youth.

39:29.800 --> 39:33.800
So this is

39:33.800 --> 39:37.800
I think a really critical slide. It keeps coming up as we think about

39:37.800 --> 39:41.800
bringing into the dashboard items like the California Science

39:41.800 --> 39:45.800
Test and other pieces of it that

39:45.800 --> 39:49.800
we need to make sure that we have a balance of indicators

39:49.800 --> 39:53.800
that we have as I mentioned before. An overwhelming majority of them need to be on the

39:53.800 --> 39:57.800
academic achievement side or other academic. So this is how

39:57.800 --> 40:01.800
it is distributed. I don't think you see this chart in our state plan for

40:01.800 --> 40:05.800
ESSA but this is how it's distributed under those labels. So

40:05.800 --> 40:09.800
academic achievement, you see the majority of our pieces are

40:09.800 --> 40:13.800
on the left hand side. On the right hand side those school quality or student

40:13.800 --> 40:17.800
success indicators are considered suspension in our college career indicator.

40:17.800 --> 40:21.800
And I think this is where the conversation that again President Darlene Hammond was

40:21.800 --> 40:25.800
headed towards and I think we will be having future conversations around

40:25.800 --> 40:29.800
what goes in here and if there's things that we can add.

40:29.800 --> 40:33.800
So just to think back, going back to

40:33.800 --> 40:37.800
2013, 2014, 2015, what were the goals

40:37.800 --> 40:41.800
around accountability and thinking what we've been able to do as

40:41.800 --> 40:45.800
a result of the dashboard. There was interest in not only

40:45.800 --> 40:49.800
attention to teaching and learning but also increasing capacity of teachers

40:49.800 --> 40:53.800
and school leaders, increasing capacity of schools and districts

40:53.800 --> 40:57.800
to continuously improve and there was a very

40:57.800 --> 41:01.800
intended process to phase in these policy changes. So in 2013

41:01.800 --> 41:05.800
you didn't see the accountability system getting taken up right away. In 2014

41:05.800 --> 41:09.800
we really didn't pick up speed until 2015 or so on that.

41:09.800 --> 41:13.800
2016 is when the board really started making the bulk of decisions.

41:13.800 --> 41:17.800
And so that was intentional. It was meant to

41:17.800 --> 41:21.800
first make sure that our educators knew what the system

41:21.800 --> 41:25.800
was so they could explain it to their communities and so that

41:25.800 --> 41:29.800
local capacity was really important. And I think looking back over the last

41:29.800 --> 41:33.800
two years and the loss of really key individuals at our

41:33.800 --> 41:37.800
school sites, in our district administration, the amount

41:37.800 --> 41:41.800
of turnover that we see, we're sort of going back to how do we

41:41.800 --> 41:45.800
go back and grow local capacity again. So really this

41:45.800 --> 41:49.800
reset of accountability has added in

41:49.800 --> 41:53.800
an opportunity for us to go back and look at resources that we've

41:53.800 --> 41:57.800
been putting together. We have launched new web pages as of

41:57.800 --> 42:01.800
this past week around the dashboard and you're going to hear more about

42:01.800 --> 42:05.800
our toolkit at your September meeting.

42:05.800 --> 42:09.800
But also one of the goals was to make sure that the

42:09.800 --> 42:13.800
federal accountability requirements, when they were established, that we had a unified

42:13.800 --> 42:17.800
system. And so there is action that you all took back

42:17.800 --> 42:21.800
in March around, and you'll

42:21.800 --> 42:25.800
hear about it I'm sure hopefully later on this summer, for our

42:25.800 --> 42:29.800
Dashboard Alternative School status schools. And so those are one thing that if the

42:29.800 --> 42:33.800
U.S. Department of Education doesn't approve the waiver around that, that

42:33.800 --> 42:37.800
would be a consideration around how do you keep a system intact that is

42:37.800 --> 42:41.800
unified between the federal and state requirements.

42:41.800 --> 42:45.800
And as far as looking at accountability

42:45.800 --> 42:49.800
and how it's defined, still thinking that it is

42:49.800 --> 42:53.800
not just the big A accountability. It's thinking about

42:53.800 --> 42:57.800
being transparent about releasing data. And by releasing data

42:57.800 --> 43:01.800
that we've done through the dashboard, we're allowing for

43:01.800 --> 43:05.800
communities really to be engaged in the dashboard. We have

43:05.800 --> 43:09.800
made sure that through the accountability model that there's also

43:09.800 --> 43:13.800
an extension of capacity building for our county offices of education.

43:13.800 --> 43:17.800
The California Collaborative on Education Excellence, or CCE, was

43:17.800 --> 43:21.800
stood up as a result of LCFF. And I think about like 10 years ago

43:21.800 --> 43:25.800
when they didn't exist, and what did we do back then? And so the shift

43:25.800 --> 43:29.800
in focus as a result of accountability system being set up,

43:29.800 --> 43:33.800
a dashboard being produced, results in districts being identified for

43:33.800 --> 43:37.800
assistance, we are seeing this system of support

43:37.800 --> 43:41.800
has moved absolutely from a punitive measure to how can we help.

43:41.800 --> 43:45.800
And so I like that last bullet a lot because it's

43:45.800 --> 43:49.800
talking about the fact that we're not just here to identify schools. That was the old

43:49.800 --> 43:53.800
model. We're here to see how we can provide supports to increase

43:53.800 --> 43:57.800
equity student outcomes and to be more effective

43:57.800 --> 44:01.800
and be good stewards of the money that the state is investing in

44:01.800 --> 44:05.800
the system. And so

44:05.800 --> 44:09.800
just moving ahead to accountability framework, what we look at is not only

44:09.800 --> 44:13.800
performance, what we've talked about quite a bit. Equity is absolutely a main

44:13.800 --> 44:17.800
goal for the system. We are one of the few states that report out on as

44:17.800 --> 44:21.800
many student groups as we do. We have 13 student groups.

44:21.800 --> 44:25.800
We give credit for improvement. We look at change over time.

44:25.800 --> 44:29.800
We also, as I mentioned, are very transparent. We give out downloadable data

44:29.800 --> 44:33.800
files where I don't think any other state does to the extent that California

44:33.800 --> 44:37.800
does. And then finally that framework was also, we were looking at

44:37.800 --> 44:41.800
a unified system between local, state, and federal needs.

44:41.800 --> 44:45.800
And so I wanted to mention that we are committed to

44:45.800 --> 44:49.800
continuous improvement. There were times in this accountability system where

44:49.800 --> 44:53.800
the data showed that what the board had approved based on prior

44:53.800 --> 44:57.800
year data didn't quite get it right. And so the board definitely

44:57.800 --> 45:01.800
updated indicators as we moved along. And we are committed to that improvement

45:01.800 --> 45:05.800
cycle. And so every March the board receives an update

45:05.800 --> 45:09.800
from the department about what we're looking at for the year. What is the

45:09.800 --> 45:13.800
work plan? And it's really important that we think about it.

45:13.800 --> 45:17.800
I mean, we're even talking about now what the board meeting is for March. So

45:17.800 --> 45:21.800
we're planning six, eight months in advance for work because this work takes

45:21.800 --> 45:25.800
a lot of time to get valued and

45:25.800 --> 45:29.800
technical input from not only our technical experts, but policy

45:29.800 --> 45:33.800
policymakers, educators. And so by the time

45:33.800 --> 45:37.800
something has come to the board, we have tried to vet it through every

45:37.800 --> 45:41.800
means in which we know is available out there.

45:41.800 --> 45:45.800
And so this review does allow for you all not

45:45.800 --> 45:49.800
to make decisions on a whim. It's coming to you as something that is

45:49.800 --> 45:53.800
technically sound, again, that has been vetted. Not everybody may

45:53.800 --> 45:57.800
agree on the ultimate decision, but at least

45:57.800 --> 46:01.800
it's been done in a very transparent manner. And all of that

46:01.800 --> 46:05.800
to say that we put that item back

46:05.800 --> 46:09.800
before you in March because it takes us the rest of the year to make sure

46:09.800 --> 46:13.800
that we can implement those pieces or gear up for a release every December.

46:13.800 --> 46:17.800
And so just to summarize

46:17.800 --> 46:21.800
just the last part of the building of the system as far as just the very high

46:21.800 --> 46:25.800
level, we absolutely depended on and we still depend

46:25.800 --> 46:29.800
on a wide variety of community

46:29.800 --> 46:33.800
members, educators, policy experts, researchers

46:33.800 --> 46:37.800
to have built this system. And just the number

46:37.800 --> 46:41.800
that stands out to me is that by spring of 2017, I came into this

46:41.800 --> 46:45.800
position in summer of 2015. The board had met fifteen times

46:45.800 --> 46:49.800
to talk about this system. So you all used to hear from our division

46:49.800 --> 46:53.800
every single meeting. And while it wasn't as lengthy as this

46:53.800 --> 46:57.800
conversation, perhaps it was on a broad range of topics that were very technical

46:57.800 --> 47:01.800
in nature. And so we just want to make sure that we uplifted that

47:01.800 --> 47:05.800
in the item that was before you today as far as what you saw

47:05.800 --> 47:09.800
in writing ahead of this presentation. And then just to give you

47:09.800 --> 47:13.800
a little teaser before Kim comes up and walks you through the indicators.

47:13.800 --> 47:17.800
This is, I think, just a great summary that we haven't put out

47:17.800 --> 47:21.800
before, but it really tells you at a glance the COVID

47:21.800 --> 47:25.800
impact for 2020, for 2021, and then this restart

47:25.800 --> 47:29.800
of 2022. But you can also see the gradual

47:29.800 --> 47:33.800
moving in of indicators. So we had to move, we never collected

47:33.800 --> 47:37.800
chronic absenteeism data prior to 2017. And

47:37.800 --> 47:41.800
so collecting that data set and then reporting it on the dashboard in 2018

47:41.800 --> 47:45.800
was very significant for us as a state. Looking

47:45.800 --> 47:49.800
at something that we've collected for a decade is suspension

47:49.800 --> 47:53.800
rate. And we can see those checks across the three

47:53.800 --> 47:57.800
years of our dashboard that we've had. That is a consistent metric

47:57.800 --> 48:01.800
along with graduation rates and of course our student assessments as well as local

48:01.800 --> 48:05.800
indicators. So this is just a nice handy chart to

48:05.800 --> 48:09.800
understand what's available out there right now on the dashboard,

48:09.800 --> 48:13.800
what you can look at, and then obviously the pieces that are missing

48:13.800 --> 48:17.800
and knowing a little bit behind why they're missing. So with that, President Darling

48:17.800 --> 48:21.800
Hammond, I thought I would turn it over to you for clarifying questions before we move into state

48:21.800 --> 48:25.800
indicators.

48:25.800 --> 48:29.800
Let me get off of mute. Let me see

48:29.800 --> 48:33.800
if anyone has any clarifying questions. If there aren't any, we'll go right on to

48:33.800 --> 48:37.800
the next section of the briefing. I'm looking

48:37.800 --> 48:41.800
to see if there are any hands going up.

48:41.800 --> 48:45.800
All right. Let's go. I don't see any at the moment, so

48:45.800 --> 48:49.800
let's go right on ahead. Thank you.

48:53.800 --> 48:57.800
All right.

48:57.800 --> 49:01.800
Just switch everything out. Good morning, everyone.

49:01.800 --> 49:05.800
Kimberly Muntank. I am the new Accountability Development and Policy

49:05.800 --> 49:09.800
Analysis Unit Administrator. And so thank you so much,

49:09.800 --> 49:13.800
Cindy, for the great introduction. And today I am going to walk you through

49:13.800 --> 49:17.800
the nitty-gritty details about the dashboard. So I apologize

49:17.800 --> 49:21.800
if you are already very well versed in this information or if you feel

49:21.800 --> 49:25.800
it gets a little bit low in the weeds. The reason we're bringing this to your attention now

49:25.800 --> 49:29.800
is that you have a great reference so that when we bring any other additional

49:29.800 --> 49:33.800
indicators and questions to the board, will you have this wonderful

49:33.800 --> 49:37.800
amazing reference guide to look back on and to remember, oh, I think I

49:37.800 --> 49:41.800
remember Kimberly saying something about that back in July. Well, here it is for you

49:41.800 --> 49:45.800
today. First off, really, how is the dashboard used?

49:45.800 --> 49:49.800
Well, in general, it provides specific information on indicators

49:49.800 --> 49:53.800
to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas of needing improvement

49:53.800 --> 49:57.800
as Cindy stated before, specifically for things like our system

49:57.800 --> 50:01.800
of support. We also report data for all of our student groups.

50:01.800 --> 50:05.800
So all 13 student groups receive information

50:05.800 --> 50:09.800
on the dashboard. And it is to promote that continuous improvement

50:09.800 --> 50:13.800
for both local education agencies that are eligible for

50:13.800 --> 50:17.800
LCF support as well as state indicator data for determining

50:17.800 --> 50:21.800
which schools are eligible for support under ESSA.

50:21.800 --> 50:25.800
We try our best to release the dashboard every December.

50:25.800 --> 50:29.800
And currently, we're looking at a December release for the 2022 data

50:29.800 --> 50:33.800
as well. The first thing you're going to see

50:33.800 --> 50:37.800
on the dashboard on every single page for schools

50:37.800 --> 50:41.800
and LEAs is information on the student population. So we're looking

50:41.800 --> 50:45.800
at enrollment data for the overall population of the school. And then we specifically

50:45.800 --> 50:49.800
call out the population segments for socioeconomically disadvantaged

50:49.800 --> 50:53.800
students, English learners, and foster youth, those

50:53.800 --> 50:57.800
LCFF student groups that we want to pay attention to specifically.

50:57.800 --> 51:01.800
Then you're going to see information, as Cindy

51:01.800 --> 51:05.800
already shared with you before, on six state indicators

51:05.800 --> 51:09.800
that are gathered from data from LEAs.

51:09.800 --> 51:13.800
The LEAs are reported to the CDE as well as local indicator data

51:13.800 --> 51:17.800
from the local LEAs. So now I'm

51:17.800 --> 51:21.800
going to walk through what those state six indicators are. As Cindy already said,

51:21.800 --> 51:25.800
we have academic performance, high school graduation rate, suspension rate,

51:25.800 --> 51:29.800
chronic absenteeism, college career readiness, and English learner progress.

51:29.800 --> 51:33.800
Now, this is the nitty-gritty. I apologize.

51:33.800 --> 51:37.800
Sincerely, we're going to walk you through

51:37.800 --> 51:41.800
I guess I'm going to say 2016-2017, what we

51:41.800 --> 51:45.800
really walked through the board with, on how we get into what

51:45.800 --> 51:49.800
measurement is for our accountability system.

51:49.800 --> 51:53.800
In May of 2016, the state board approved measuring performance

51:53.800 --> 51:57.800
for state indicators in a revolutionary way, as President Darling Hammond

51:57.800 --> 52:01.800
already shared with us. We looked at combining, not just

52:01.800 --> 52:05.800
or not just looking at status, but combining two equally weighted

52:05.800 --> 52:09.800
components for both status of current year performance

52:09.800 --> 52:13.800
and change, which is the difference between the prior year and the current year.

52:13.800 --> 52:17.800
We categorized status

52:17.800 --> 52:21.800
into five status levels for every single indicator.

52:21.800 --> 52:25.800
Starting at very low, going up to low, medium, we know where that is,

52:25.800 --> 52:29.800
high, and all the way to very high.

52:29.800 --> 52:33.800
Now, in order to determine these five status levels,

52:33.800 --> 52:37.800
we needed to look at where performance

52:37.800 --> 52:41.800
truly ranks and to categorize performance

52:41.800 --> 52:45.800
into what is very low and what is very high.

52:45.800 --> 52:49.800
How we did this is we went about a very specific process.

52:49.800 --> 52:53.800
As I apologize for walking you through this,

52:53.800 --> 52:57.800
it really is important because

52:57.800 --> 53:01.800
you, as a board member, will likely be seeing

53:01.800 --> 53:05.800
the establishment of cut scores and status levels and change levels in future years.

53:05.800 --> 53:09.800
The first thing we do is we look at the results

53:09.800 --> 53:13.800
for all LEAs and charter schools, because under LCFF,

53:13.800 --> 53:17.800
charter schools are LEAs, and we look at all the statewide student level data

53:17.800 --> 53:21.800
that we have for them. Then we order those results from highest

53:21.800 --> 53:25.800
to lowest, and we establish four cut points based

53:25.800 --> 53:29.800
on the percentile distribution within status levels.

53:29.800 --> 53:33.800
We start at very low, and the

53:33.800 --> 53:37.800
reason we do this is because we want to indicate what is

53:37.800 --> 53:41.800
the unacceptable level of performance that would result

53:41.800 --> 53:45.800
specifically through our system of support in intense and focused

53:45.800 --> 53:49.800
support. That's really important. So what we're looking at as on this

53:49.800 --> 53:53.800
list of LEAs, performance distribution, we're looking at a small

53:53.800 --> 53:57.800
percent at the lowest end of the performance distribution, because

53:57.800 --> 54:01.800
we know that these are aggregate levels, so we know when we look at student group

54:01.800 --> 54:05.800
support levels, it's going to actually, performance is going to be distributed

54:05.800 --> 54:09.800
amongst those levels equally.

54:09.800 --> 54:13.800
The next cut point we look at setting is the high status cut point, and this

54:13.800 --> 54:17.800
is used to determine what ESSA labels as an ambitious

54:17.800 --> 54:21.800
long-term goal. So this is the level that we expect all

54:21.800 --> 54:25.800
LEAs and schools to obtain within the state. That's our high level.

54:25.800 --> 54:29.800
So we walk through and set what that expectation should be.

54:29.800 --> 54:33.800
After that, we fill in the remaining levels for low,

54:33.800 --> 54:37.800
medium, and very high, for all of our status levels.

54:39.800 --> 54:43.800
We've talked through five status levels. We also need five change levels,

54:43.800 --> 54:47.800
and those go from decline significantly all the way to increase significantly.

54:47.800 --> 54:51.800
And this is going to look very familiar

54:51.800 --> 54:55.800
because we do the exact same thing with change. We're looking at

54:55.800 --> 54:59.800
setting cut scores across those levels in order to categorize performance

54:59.800 --> 55:03.800
in how schools and LEAs have changed

55:03.800 --> 55:07.800
year over year. Now

55:07.800 --> 55:11.800
we also start in the same place. We look at decline significantly first,

55:11.800 --> 55:15.800
and then we move into increased to check and see where our

55:15.800 --> 55:19.800
goals are for the state.

55:19.800 --> 55:23.800
Now, the reason we talked about all

55:23.800 --> 55:27.800
of these cut points is because each state indicator has

55:27.800 --> 55:31.800
their own unique set of cut points. This is

55:31.800 --> 55:35.800
important because I talked about that we use a percentile distribution

55:35.800 --> 55:39.800
of data that we already have available. Each

55:39.800 --> 55:43.800
of our indicators, the state starts out in a different place with the data that

55:43.800 --> 55:47.800
we had in 2017 when we established these scores.

55:47.800 --> 55:51.800
And the distribution of performance looks very different across

55:51.800 --> 55:55.800
different indicators. For example, performance across

55:55.800 --> 55:59.800
our college career indicator looks markedly different than performance

55:59.800 --> 56:03.800
across our graduation rate indicator. So we want to make sure that

56:03.800 --> 56:07.800
what we were doing with those percentile distributions and this

56:07.800 --> 56:11.800
cut score process was looking at established data

56:11.800 --> 56:15.800
and setting cut scores off of that data and moving forward.

56:15.800 --> 56:19.800
These cut scores will remain until the state

56:19.800 --> 56:23.800
board chooses to update those standards. And per the SSA plan

56:23.800 --> 56:27.800
that is to be reviewed every seven years. And just as a note,

56:27.800 --> 56:31.800
today's consent item for the state board item

56:31.800 --> 56:35.800
of our adendum template, we're looking at a recommendation that

56:35.800 --> 56:39.800
we move forward due to COVID

56:39.800 --> 56:43.800
that reset of cut scores for an additional two years.

56:43.800 --> 56:47.800
So I breeze through status,

56:47.800 --> 56:51.800
I breeze through change, but if you look at the dashboard

56:51.800 --> 56:55.800
you're not going to see these words on it. What you're going to see are a bunch of color dials.

56:55.800 --> 56:59.800
And that's because our dashboard is full of color and that's the ultimate

56:59.800 --> 57:03.800
performance distribution and determination that we make

57:03.800 --> 57:07.800
for accountability.

57:07.800 --> 57:11.800
This is our five by five grid. And on the left side you can

57:11.800 --> 57:15.800
see status walking through

57:15.800 --> 57:19.800
from very low in the current year to very high in the current year at the top row.

57:19.800 --> 57:23.800
And on the left across the top you can see decline significantly

57:23.800 --> 57:27.800
all the way to increase significantly. This

57:27.800 --> 57:31.800
matrix allows us to combine status and change to receive

57:31.800 --> 57:35.800
a color determination. So you can see if you scored high in the current

57:35.800 --> 57:39.800
year and you had increased your performance from the prior year

57:39.800 --> 57:43.800
in a normal dashboard year where we have colors

57:43.800 --> 57:47.800
you would receive a green determination according to this five

57:47.800 --> 57:51.800
by five. Each of the indicators has their own set of

57:51.800 --> 57:55.800
color grids and five by five grids. We did not share them

57:55.800 --> 57:59.800
all with you today. We have a beautiful technical guide that's over two hundred pages

57:59.800 --> 58:03.800
with a lovely index that you can refer to in order to see each

58:03.800 --> 58:07.800
and every one of those five by five grids. But this is also available on our

58:07.800 --> 58:11.800
additional reports. We provide our information there to make

58:11.800 --> 58:15.800
sure the districts are clear around where they are on their five by five

58:15.800 --> 58:19.800
grid and how performance is distributed among student groups,

58:19.800 --> 58:23.800
among schools within an alley in our district, and across

58:23.800 --> 58:27.800
different years. And it really truly allows them to see where they

58:27.800 --> 58:31.800
are and what they need to do in order to approve their color year over year.

58:31.800 --> 58:35.800
In the spirit of

58:35.800 --> 58:39.800
continuous improvement when we released our first five

58:39.800 --> 58:43.800
by five grids we realized that small

58:43.800 --> 58:47.800
student populations were more susceptible to large swings

58:47.800 --> 58:51.800
in change year over year due to

58:51.800 --> 58:55.800
simply math. Therefore a three by five grid

58:55.800 --> 58:59.800
was applied to any population size less than 150

58:59.800 --> 59:03.800
students. So we actually applied this three by five especially for

59:03.800 --> 59:07.800
the graduation rate, suspension rate, chronic absenteeism, and the college

59:07.800 --> 59:11.800
career indicator. So this allows essentially

59:11.800 --> 59:15.800
small schools and small student populations not to get caught up

59:15.800 --> 59:19.800
in the effects of one student changing

59:19.800 --> 59:23.800
their entire rate as is good to happen as a former math

59:23.800 --> 59:27.800
teacher. When you're looking at percentages and it's a small population, that's

59:27.800 --> 59:31.800
what happens. It's just math. So a three by

59:31.800 --> 59:35.800
five looks like this. We just cut off the decline significantly

59:35.800 --> 59:39.800
and increase significantly columns. And so you still have a color grid.

59:39.800 --> 59:43.800
You still have options for different performance. You still have the same

59:43.800 --> 59:47.800
determinations. It's just you aren't prevented from making the wild

59:47.800 --> 59:51.800
swings on either side that may have linked

59:51.800 --> 59:55.800
you into those columns and flip flopped you back and forth.

59:55.800 --> 59:59.800
The additional nitty gritty before

59:59.800 --> 01:00:03.800
I get to the indicators of the dashboard. These are

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:07.800
the fun rules that really allow us to

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:11.800
treat accountability the way that California needs accountability

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:15.800
to be treated. And in speaking with many states, presenting

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:19.800
different conferences and talking to other partners. A lot of states don't have to deal

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:23.800
with this. They don't have to walk through things and

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:27.800
we have gone to great lengths to really make our system

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:31.800
fair, valid and reliable for all schools, LEAs

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:35.800
and students really. And this is because we listen with an open

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:39.800
ear. We do come frequently to state board meetings where we

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:43.800
have that opportunity for input and really understanding what goes on.

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:47.800
The first rule which takes place universally on our dashboard for the first time this year

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:51.800
surrounds district of residence. Previously it only applied to

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:55.800
our academic indicators. And this allows that students with

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:59.800
disabilities who receive services at another entity

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:03.800
outside of their district will have their results sent back

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:07.800
to their district of residence. That district is responsible for the

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:11.800
educational outcomes for that student and they want to make sure instead of

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:15.800
that student going and their results being coalesced somewhere else

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:19.800
those results are going to get sent back to them and hopefully engage in a

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:23.800
better dialogue around the services they're receiving and the educational outcomes

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:27.800
that are going on. Not just for that student but perhaps

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:31.800
in the programs the districts are choosing. Additionally

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:35.800
charter schools as I mentioned before through LCFF

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:39.800
require us to treat all charter schools as LEAs. So when we speak

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:43.800
about LEAs in any item make sure and note

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:47.800
and keep your tuned in that charter schools are included there.

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:51.800
And then finally our dashboard alternative school status which many of you were

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:55.800
introduced to in March during our item. This

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:59.800
was our system that allows for modified methods of measurement for

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:03.800
indicators to evaluate the success or progress of schools that serve high

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:07.800
risk students. This program whether or not

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:11.800
or however we hear back from the federal government we are really

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:15.800
invested in this program and we hear time

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:19.800
and time again from partners in the field how important it is to recognize

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:23.800
that we have unique schools that serve unique students with unique

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:27.800
needs. And the ability of this program and label

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:31.800
and to allow us to have on the dashboard really helps us show

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:35.800
with these modified methods really what these students are

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:39.800
doing in those schools. So we will continue to update you on the progress of

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:43.800
this system and this program

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:47.800
as we move through our federal waiver request.

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:51.800
And then finally this we have this slide up

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:55.800
because the number one most asked question phone call email

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:59.800
that we receive the accountability department surrounds end size or

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:03.800
population size. And due to wanting to make everything statistically

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:07.800
significant on the dashboard we have rules around

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:11.800
what data we display. And so LE schools and student groups

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:15.800
will receive a performance color which essentially

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:19.800
in our system means that they're held accountable. If they have

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:23.800
two years of data so enough to have a status and a change

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:27.800
and have a population size of 30 or more students

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:31.800
both in the current year and the prior year

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:35.800
and the only exception to that is that at the LEA level the minimum population size

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:39.800
for foster youth and homeless drops to 15 and not 30.

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:43.800
But note charter schools need 30 foster youth or homeless

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:47.800
students because they are a school in that determination

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:51.800
versus an LEA in the LC of that determination. So as you can

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:55.800
see it's kind of confusing but it's the number one thing when people call us and say

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:59.800
why don't I have a color? I don't understand. It's usually because

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:03.800
of a small population size in a prior year that's not

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:07.800
showing up. So

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:11.800
I'm about to walk you through each of our six indicators and I want to

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:15.800
organize them in the same way that Cindy introduced previously

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:19.800
is that the dashboard displays all of our state and local indicators nested

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:23.800
under three categories. Academic performance, academic engagement

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:27.800
and then conditions and climate. So we're going to walk through each of the indicators

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:31.800
as you would see them up here on the dashboard in the same exact order.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:35.800
And first we're going to start with academic performance.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:39.800
And our two academic indicators, English language arts literacy

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:43.800
and mathematics.

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:47.800
Now our academic indicators, it's kind of easy to start there

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:51.800
because we remember these. These are part as President Darling Hammond said

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:55.800
of our old accountability system as well. But they look a little different here.

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:59.800
They're based on the Sperner balance summative assessment as well

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:03.800
as performance on the California alternative assessments taken in grades three through

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:07.800
eight and eleven in both

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:11.800
English language arts and mathematics.

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:15.800
Our academic indicators have two components.

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:19.800
One is just the performance on the test for all of the students, an aggregate of

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:23.800
their performance. And secondly and importantly for this year especially

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:27.800
is a participation rate which is our federal law that requires all

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:31.800
schools and LEAs to test at least 95% of all students.

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:35.800
Now as

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:39.800
President Darling Hammond mentioned, previously we had a system that was

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:43.800
dependent solely on academic performance. And

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:47.800
it was also dependent on how many students met a performance

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:51.800
threshold of proficient. If you go to the CASP website

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:55.800
you'll see categories of test performance still

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:59.800
going into the four buckets and still looking at percent proficient

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:03.800
across things. On the dashboard we look at academic

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:07.800
performance in a very different way. And I wanted to

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:11.800
highlight this slide just to familiarize you with it if you're not.

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:15.800
And I appreciate that the distance is in quotation marks there.

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:19.800
We measure things through distance from standard

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:23.800
which marks the distance a student is from.

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:27.800
The lowest standard met or level three

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:31.800
score for that grade. So in this example that you see on your

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:35.800
screen, a student scored 2505

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:39.800
on their grade five exam. The lowest

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:43.800
scale score point range for grade five

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:47.800
is 2528. Therefore they were

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:51.800
negative 23 points away from

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:55.800
that lowest standard. So their aggregate

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:59.800
score would be negative 23. What we do

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:03.800
is we aggregate all of these student level

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:07.800
distance from standards in order to create a large average

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:11.800
at the school level. This is much different than

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:15.800
how many students scored above the bar. We're actually

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:19.800
looking to see how much positive, how much further

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:23.800
your students exceeded that bar and how

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:27.800
far away they are from it on average. And that's what distance from standard is looking

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:31.800
to capture. Additionally, and I point

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:35.800
this out this year because it is the first year we are implementing

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:39.800
a new policy due to our ESSA plan, is that

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:43.800
there is a new federal penalty that has been imposed

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:47.800
that requires us to assign the lowest obtainable scale score

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:51.800
which is the bottom score that a student could possibly receive

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:55.800
to each student in order to bring

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:59.800
a school or student group or LEA up

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:03.800
to the 95% participation rate.

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:07.800
This is a significant penalty as before it was

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:11.800
our penalty was not as harsh or severe. This year

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:15.800
it's different and it will impact the overall performance scores

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:19.800
for student groups, schools and LEAs across our dashboard.

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:23.800
It was scheduled to go into place in 2020

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:27.800
and things obviously didn't work out that year for testing.

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:31.800
So this will be the first year you see that on the dashboard. That's why it's important to

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:35.800
note that it is a combination of both student performance

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:39.800
and a reflection of the participation rate

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:43.800
at each school. The reason that this is incorporated is essentially

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:47.800
that we don't know what each student who didn't

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:51.800
test would have scored. Therefore, we need

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:55.800
to impute a score in order to do that and

01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:59.800
the only score we can impute is the lowest possible score

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:03.800
that they could obtain. So it really is an incentive to test all students

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:07.800
at each school and district and we hope that

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:11.800
the participation rates across our schools this year

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:15.800
is reflective of that and that we don't see this penalty really incurring

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:19.800
any problems around the state.

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:23.800
So the simple calculation is just the average distance from standard for all of those

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:27.800
students who took the Smarter Balanced Assessment or the California Alternative Assessment.

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:31.800
And then our denominator is just the number of students who are continuously

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:35.800
enrolled within the academic year. And that's

01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:39.800
an important note in that our academic indicator does take

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:43.800
into consideration only students who were present from

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:47.800
census day through testing period without a large break

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:51.800
in their enrollment. So we don't include students who

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:55.800
had just enrolled in school the day before and sat down to take the test.

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:59.800
However, they may be incorporated into the participation rate due to business rules.

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:03.800
Our next big academic

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:07.800
indicator is our English Learner Progress Indicator. And this one

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:11.800
holds a very special place in my heart as a former teacher of English

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:15.800
learners. I'm so excited to see the results for this

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:19.800
indicator on the dashboard each year and seeing really how much we've

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:23.800
progressed in over 20 years since I taught

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:27.800
my students. The English Learner Progress Indicator is based

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:31.800
on how English learners are moving towards proficiency

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:35.800
on their English language proficiency assessment for California

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:39.800
or LPAC scores. And it applies to all English learner

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:43.800
students in grades 1 through 12. And that might sound

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:47.800
a little weird that it's not kindergarten,

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:51.800
but the reason why is it is a progress indicator and we need two years of data

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:55.800
in order to assess progress. So therefore it doesn't kick in

01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:59.800
until grade one.

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:03.800
Important to note is that the English Learner Progress Indicator is the only

01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:07.800
indicator on the dashboard that's isolated to one single student group.

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:11.800
We do not further delineate this indicator into

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:15.800
any racial groups or any of our program groups

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:19.800
outside of English learner. So for example, you won't see

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:23.800
a breakout for Asian English learners, Hispanic English learners,

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:27.800
White English learners within the LP. It's simply just

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:31.800
English learners as the student group reported out. So those 13

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:35.800
student subgroups do not apply to this indicator.

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:39.800
How we determine a student making progress is

01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:43.800
pretty simple. We're looking at the LPAC levels

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:47.800
for, there are four different levels for the LPAC that are scored in.

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:51.800
And we further delineate levels 2 and 3 and we break them apart into

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:55.800
two additional levels. The reason we do this is for accountability purposes

01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:59.800
we want to reflect the average five to seven year trajectory

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:03.800
growth for English learners towards proficiency. And therefore

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:07.800
moving from one level to a level above will show

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:11.800
progress and gain you credit within this indicator.

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:15.800
The LP is calculated by

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:19.800
showing the number of students who increased at least one LP level between the

01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:23.800
current and prior year. And then additionally the number of students

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:27.800
who maintained the current level four

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:31.800
criterion between the current and the prior year. The reason this

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:35.800
is important is because the determination for reclassification is a local

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:39.800
determination. And so students that need to be

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:43.800
reclassified, perhaps with the criterion being level four

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:47.800
achieving, they may need additional criteria outside of that.

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:51.800
It's not a state indicator to be able to do that, but we don't want to punish students

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:55.800
that have shown that they have made progress to the highest extent possible.

01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:59.800
They're in level four, however their district has not reclassified

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:03.800
them due to their criteria within the local determination.

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:07.800
And then the denominator is just all of the students with a current and prior year LPAC

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:11.800
summative assessment level. So we are only looking at current English language

01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:15.800
learners who are required to test using the LPAC.

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:19.800
Now I briefly mentioned this before,

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:23.800
but this is another one of those fun little hang ups, is that

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:27.800
it's reflected in that lovely chart that Cindy shared.

01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:31.800
LP status is kind of a change measure.

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:35.800
It needs two years. We're looking at progress year over year. So

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:39.800
we need two years of LPAC data in order to produce a

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:43.800
status. And boy gosh are we lucky this year that we do have that.

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:47.800
So that's why LP will be showing up as a status level on our dashboard this year.

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:51.800
But in order to create change, or measure change rather,

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:55.800
we need three full years because we need two status

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:59.800
years in order to do that. And so I'm happy to report

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:03.800
that, fingers crossed, all things looking good

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:07.800
into the next year, you will see LP change

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:11.800
and you will be determining what LP change

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:15.800
cut scores will be looking like and colors will be looking like for the first time

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:19.800
based on the new LPAC test in 2023.

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:23.800
So look forward to that as a board item next fall.

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:27.800
Next we have our very

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:31.800
revolutionary college career indicator. And I know

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:35.800
President Darling-Hammond did some bragging about how California is ahead of the curve.

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:39.800
I can, as of two weeks ago, presenting

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:43.800
and attending the annual student assessment conference,

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:47.800
I can tell you that states are just starting to look into a measurement

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:51.800
of this. So to state that this has been a part of our dashboard and proudly

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:55.800
talk about it with other states, it's a nice thing to do

01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:59.800
and to be confident about just the breadth and scope of what we have

01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:03.800
in our system and what the state board has helped us achieve.

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:07.800
The CCI is based on students

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:11.800
in the graduation rate. So students must graduate first

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:15.800
and they're placed into three different levels. They're either measured

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:19.800
as prepared, approaching prepared, or not prepared.

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:23.800
And just as a note and precaution, you will not be seeing the CCI

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:27.800
on the dashboard this year. And that is due to

01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:31.800
the flexibility in the testing arrangements made last year

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:35.800
for last year's grade 11 students. We talked about this in March at our

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:39.800
item, but essentially because that makes up a large bulk

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:43.800
of the determinations and information criteria necessary

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:47.800
since we did not have all students that had the option

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:51.800
to take our CASP assessment, we will not have a status

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:55.800
this year. We're going to share out information about how students

01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:59.800
are doing on each of the components, but it will not be shown as status on the dashboard.

01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:03.800
Now, just look at this

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:07.800
lovely list. On the left we have what we established as

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:11.800
experience for our college measures. Those are inclusive of AP exams,

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:15.800
IB exams, college credit courses, E through G completion,

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:19.800
the state sealed by literacy, and smarter ballots assessments.

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:23.800
On the right you see a short list of our career measures, and

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:27.800
stay tuned, more will be added to that list, or rather evaluated

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:31.800
for addition to that list very soon. Currently adopted

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:35.800
we have CTE pathway completion, leadership military science,

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:39.800
pre-apprenticeship, and then for our DAS schools we have state and federal

01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:43.800
job programs and transition classroom and work based learning experiences.

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:47.800
On the bottom of the slide we have two links to what I would consider

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:51.800
very beautiful flyers on our website, and we'll be

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:55.800
showing you all of these flyers at our September meeting as we roll out our dashboard toolkit.

01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:59.800
But these are very intense measures

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:03.800
and each of the components contribute in different ways and actually

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:07.800
combinations of indicators combine in different ways

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:11.800
to achieve a level of who is

01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:15.800
prepared. If you are approaching prepared, perhaps you've met some of the

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:19.800
criteria but on everything, and if you are not prepared for

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:23.800
college or career according to our indicator.

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:27.800
Now the numerator only includes

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:31.800
the number of graduates who are in the prepared level. We report out

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:35.800
on who achieves a level of approaching prepared, but they do not make it

01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:39.800
into the calculus of our actual indicator. And then the denominator

01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:43.800
simply again the number of students and the denominator of the full

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:47.800
graduation rate. And you must be a graduate in order to qualify

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:51.800
to be prepared for college or career readiness as well.

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:55.800
We move on from those

01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:59.800
other academic indicators into academic engagement with chronic

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:03.800
absenteeism and the graduation rate.

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:07.800
Now obviously this is going to be quite

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:11.800
an indicator to look at this year as we gauge the percent

01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:15.800
of students who are considered chronically absent, which means

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:19.800
in the state of California that they're absent for 10% or more of the instructional days

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:23.800
that they were enrolled to attend. And this indicator is specific

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:27.800
only to grades K through 8. It does not apply at the high school

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:31.800
level. Now unlike other indicators,

01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:35.800
the desired outcome of the chronic absenteeism indicator is actually

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:39.800
low. We want a low chronic absenteeism rate and therefore

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:43.800
very low on this indicator is the best status level, which is a little

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:47.800
bit different than let's say academic performance. We don't want very low academic

01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:51.800
performance. So you're going to see the values flip-flop

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:55.800
in status for this indicator.

01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:59.800
The calculation for chronic absenteeism

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:03.800
is just the number of students who meet that threshold of being

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:07.800
10% absent for more of the instructional days than they

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:11.800
were enrolled to attend. And then the denominator is all of the students

01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:15.800
who were enrolled at an entity for more than 30 days.

01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:19.800
We do not include students who were enrolled under 30 days

01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:23.800
in our denominator due to flip-flops going around. So

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:27.800
this is though remeasured at schools, LEAs, and the

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:31.800
state level. So you might see different. A student may be

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:35.800
chronically absent in an LEA, but they may not show up and appear as chronically

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:39.800
absent at the school level.

01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:43.800
Our other very familiar indicator is a graduation

01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:47.800
rate indicator. And I won't spend much time other than flipping through the slides on this, as

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:51.800
it's the percent of high school graduates who receive a traditional diploma in

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:55.800
grade 12. However, in California, we've added

01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:59.800
a little bit of spice to this one, as we actually measure a combined graduation

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:03.800
rate, which is a combination of our four- and five-year

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:07.800
graduation rate for comprehensive and DAS high schools.

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:11.800
So it reflects any students who are captured in our traditional

01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:15.800
four-year cohort rate, as well as any five-year graduates

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:19.800
from the prior graduating class.

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:23.800
We're looking at all of those students, the traditional cohort

01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:27.800
students in the numerator, and then we add in the number

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:31.800
of fifth-year graduates from the prior graduating class. For the denominator,

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:35.800
we use the four-year cohort rate. Denominator is all of the

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:39.800
students in the current cohort. And then we additionally add the number of

01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:43.800
fifth-year graduates from the prior graduating class. So this

01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:47.800
calculation gets a little confusing as well, but it really is just allowing

01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:51.800
us to capture any students who have, through

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:55.800
approval from their school and LEA and district, to move on and

01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:59.800
complete their course through a fifth year. And we've gotten a lot of great feedback from our

01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:03.800
LEAs and from schools in support of this combination graduation

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:07.800
rate. Additionally, we have a

01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:11.800
modified measure for our DAS graduation rate. And this

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:15.800
is a one-year graduation rate that only looks at students who are presently in

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:19.800
grade 12 and how many of those students graduate within

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:23.800
that same year. And

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:27.800
finally, our conditions and climate state indicator, the suspension rate.

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:31.800
This indicator

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:35.800
reflects the percent of students who are suspended for at least

01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:39.800
one full aggregate day in any of the grades K

01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:43.800
through 12. Similar to chronic

01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:47.800
absenteeism, we're looking at a reverse goal of very low

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:51.800
for suspension versus very high for other indicators.

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:55.800
And our suspension rate indicator

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:59.800
is the number of unduplicated students who have an

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:03.800
aggregate suspension of at least one full day. So if they were suspended

01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:07.800
for a half day once, they also need to be suspended for a

01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:11.800
cumulative half day somewhere else in order to get to count

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:15.800
in the suspension rate indicator. And then our denominator is all students who are enrolled

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:19.800
for at least one day at that entity. The only confusion around this

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:23.800
indicator often pops up is that someone will say, oh, it's one

01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:27.800
student bringing down our suspension rate. This is not a count

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:31.800
of the number of suspensions at a school or a district.

01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:35.800
That information is available on DataQuest for the total number of suspensions

01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:39.800
and students suspended. We're just looking at

01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:43.800
how many students suspended and how many total students.

01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:47.800
So one student could be suspended 15 times, but if they're the only

01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:51.800
students suspended at the school for the year, they only had one suspended student

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:55.800
for the numerator. So that is a clarification around that.

01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:59.800
With that, I am going to introduce our

01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:03.800
SASD team to walk you through the local indicators.

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:21.800
Good morning.

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:25.800
President Darling Hammond, Vice President Glover Woods, State Superintendent

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:29.800
of Public Instruction Tony Thurman, Chief Deputy Nicely,

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:33.800
members of the State Board of Education, staff, and the public. My name is

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:37.800
William McGee, and I'm the new Director of the Student Achievement and Support Division.

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:41.800
I appreciate the opportunity to be introduced this morning.

01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:45.800
Although this is only day three, it does feel like I've been here for a year.

01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:49.800
And that's a good thing. The CDE staff that I've met

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:53.800
have been very gracious and nice, and especially

01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:57.800
Delana Foreman, Dereese Barfield, Patty Colvin, Justin Errington,

01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:01.800
and Rochelle Smoky. They have been very welcoming and very

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:05.800
helpful. Another example of this is the collaborative nature

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:09.800
of the Students Achievement and Support Division, the educational

01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:13.800
administrators, Joshua Strong and Carrie Lopes. They were gracious enough

01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:17.800
to allow me to introduce myself, and I will turn it over to them.

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:21.800
Carrie Lopes will talk about the local indicators. Thank you very much.

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:29.800
Thank you, Will, and welcome to CDE and welcome to SASD.

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:33.800
So this portion of the presentation is

01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:37.800
to give the State Board a short overview of the purpose and

01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:41.800
history of the local indicators and results and how they're kind of

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:45.800
reported on the dashboard. The work of the local indicators lies

01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:49.800
within LASSO.

01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:53.800
So what are the local indicators? State data is

01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:57.800
not available for some priority areas identified in LCFF

01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:01.800
statute. For these priority areas, the State Board approved

01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:05.800
local indicators, which are based on information that an LEA

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:09.800
collects at the local level. The State Board adopted

01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:13.800
a self-reflection tool for each local indicator. This tool

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:17.800
supports the annual reporting of progress on the dashboard.

01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:21.800
Additionally, the local indicator process serves to inform

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:25.800
planning and progress within the LCAP.

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:29.800
So currently

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:33.800
there are seven local indicators, two only specific to

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:37.800
county offices of education, and Cindy spoke of this briefly

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:41.800
in her presentation. So the local indicators are

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:45.800
priority one, basic conditions of learning. Priority two,

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:49.800
implementation of state academic standards.

01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:53.800
Priority three, parental involvement and family engagement.

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:57.800
Priority six, school climate as measured by a

01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:01.800
local climate survey only. Priority seven,

01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:05.800
access to a broad course of study. And then priorities

01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:09.800
nine and ten, which are applicable only to county offices,

01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:13.800
which are the coordination of services for expelled youth and

01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:17.800
the coordination of services for foster youth. So before we

01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:21.800
move on, I just want to quickly touch upon priority one.

01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:25.800
So first, priority one ensures that one, teachers

01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:29.800
are appropriately assigned and fully credentialed in the subject area that they are

01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:33.800
teaching. Two, every student has access to

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:37.800
instructional materials aligned to the state standards. And

01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:41.800
three, school facilities are maintained and in good repair.

01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:45.800
So in 2020, Education Code Section 52064.5

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:49.800
was revised to require that

01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:53.800
local indicators reflect school-level data when

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:57.800
CDE collects or has access to that data. The first local

01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:01.800
indicator to be impacted by this change is the teacher assignment portion

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:05.800
of priority one. Based on this change, priority one

01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:09.800
is currently undergoing a transformation, particularly

01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:13.800
in the area of teacher quality. And AMARD will be addressing the

01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:17.800
impact of legislation for the dashboard in its upcoming slides.

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:21.800
So moving on, Josh Strong will present the next few slides

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:25.800
concerning performance standards, ratings, and reporting deadlines.

01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:29.800
Thank you. Thank you, Carrie.

01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:33.800
Joshua Strong, Administrator of the Local Agency System Support Office.

01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:37.800
As Carrie mentioned,

01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:41.800
the local indicators cover

01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:45.800
a broad range of subjects. And the reason

01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:49.800
behind the local indicators is really to get at the heart of

01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:53.800
that local data that is specific

01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:57.800
to a local educational agency's

01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:01.800
students, the families that they work with, the constituents, and the community that

01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:05.800
they live in. And so a lot of this data ends up being

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:09.800
really reflective of the community in which

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:13.800
the LEA works.

01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:17.800
It's important to note that local indicators, unlike state

01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:21.800
indicators, apply only at the LEA level. They don't look at the

01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:25.800
school level. However, it's also important to

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:29.800
realize that the local indicators inform

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:33.800
the identification, the eligibility of LEAs for

01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:37.800
differentiated assistance in the same way that state indicators do.

01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:41.800
It's also important to realize that

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:45.800
with state indicators, the local indicators

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:49.800
change over time. They have flexibility.

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:53.800
And the board has the ability to make changes and

01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:57.800
adaptions to those. Case in point,

01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:01.800
in March of 2021, the state board adopted

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:05.800
a revised priority three local indicator self-reflection tool

01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:09.800
to further enhance the analysis and

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:13.800
reporting of parent involvement and family engagement within LEAs.

01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:17.800
Similarly, SB 75

01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:21.800
has instigated a

01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:25.800
change to priority one that's in the process of

01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:29.800
being worked on. And Cindy will speak more to that

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:33.800
in a little bit. And then similar to that, AB 130

01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:37.800
section 134 also provided

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:41.800
funding for the department to investigate

01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:45.800
the potential for standardized

01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:49.800
questions to be included in the surveys that are required

01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:53.800
as part of priority six related to school climate.

01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:57.800
If there's one thing that we've seen within the last few years,

01:29:57.800 --> 01:30:01.800
it's the importance of school climate on the learning environment and on

01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:05.800
student achievement. It's been something that a lot of LEAs

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:09.800
have been focusing on in their LCAPs and in their communities

01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:13.800
in general. And I think that the

01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:17.800
pandemic has really brought this to the forefront. It's important

01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:21.800
to note that when we're talking about priority six, we're actually talking

01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:25.800
about a number of different things. First,

01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:29.800
suspension rates, which are a state indicator, but also expulsion rates

01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:33.800
and other local measures which include

01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:37.800
local surveys of

01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:41.800
safety and school connectedness. So it's

01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:45.800
important to realize that LEAs have flexibility to include

01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:49.800
other local measures in addition to surveys. It's also

01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:53.800
a good thing to remind everybody that all

01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:57.800
three of these have to be included and reported in an

01:30:57.800 --> 01:31:01.800
LEA's LCAP local control and accountability plan on an

01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:05.800
annual basis. And so in light of that, the

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:09.800
board does have flexibility to pursue additional

01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:13.800
to pursue some changes to the

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:17.800
school climate to priority six and the local indicator should it desire

01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:21.800
to do so. That would include potentially

01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:25.800
looking at those more closely at those standardized

01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:29.800
survey pieces, which is being headed up

01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:33.800
by Lisa Borrego's whole child's division. But then in addition to that,

01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:37.800
the board also has flexibility to be able to consider

01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:41.800
revisions to the self-reflection tool as well as other potential

01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:45.800
ways to highlight school climate

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:49.800
within the accountability system and within the dashboard.

01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:53.800
So moving on

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:57.800
to the performance standard component of the local indicators.

01:31:57.800 --> 01:32:01.800
The SBE has approved the following

01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:05.800
performance standards for each of the local indicators. And there's

01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:09.800
three steps. First of all, the LEA is required to annually

01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:13.800
measure its progress in meeting the requirements of the LCFF

01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:17.800
priority utilizing the SBE adopted self-reflection

01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:21.800
tools for each of the local indicators. Second,

01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:25.800
the LEA is required to report those results as part of a non-consent

01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:29.800
item at the same public meeting of the local governing board or body

01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:33.800
of the LEA at which the LCAP is adopted.

01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:37.800
And then third, it's required to report the results to the

01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:41.800
public through the dashboard. Now, as it

01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:45.800
relates specifically to the dashboard, an

01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:49.800
LEA that completes all three of these criteria

01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:53.800
using the SBE

01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:57.800
approved standards receives a rating of

01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:01.800
met for that local indicator on the dashboard.

01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:05.800
An LEA that does not meet all three of those criteria

01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:09.800
in reporting to the dashboard receives a rating of not

01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:13.800
met for that local criteria on the dashboard. And an LEA

01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:17.800
that does not meet all three of the performance standards

01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:21.800
for two consecutive years receives a performance rating

01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:25.800
of not met for two or more years.

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:29.800
The rating of not met for two or more years

01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:33.800
is part of the consideration when

01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:37.800
the LEAs are, when it's being

01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:41.800
determined whether or not an LEA is eligible for differentiated

01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:45.800
assistance support.

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:49.800
So really briefly, the reporting timeline for

01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:53.800
the local indicators. In December through May

01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:57.800
of each year, the LEA should be gathering

01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:01.800
and analyzing its data. This includes data and input

01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:05.800
from educational partners, from teachers, parents, students,

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:09.800
members of the community, other school staff, local bargaining

01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:13.800
units, and using that to evaluate the

01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:17.800
LEA's implementation of each of the local indicators.

01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:21.800
The intent of this data is not only to report

01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:25.800
to the dashboard, but also to use this data to inform

01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:29.800
the LEA's LCAP and the development and the analysis

01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:33.800
of the LEA's plan and whether or not it's making

01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:37.800
progress towards that plan. Then at the same

01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:41.800
public meeting at which the LEA's LCAP is adopted,

01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:45.800
the LEA reports the local indicator results to the governing board or body

01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:49.800
of the LEA. And then finally, in late August to December,

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:53.800
the LEA's dashboard coordinator will report

01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:57.800
those local indicator results to the dashboard, which

01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:01.800
then appear when the dashboard becomes public along with

01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:05.800
the state indicators in December.

01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:09.800
So with that, I'm going to go ahead and turn it back over to

01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:13.800
Cindy Kazanis to discuss educational partner engagement

01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:17.800
and annual review.

01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:23.800
Thanks, Josh.

01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:27.800
So as we started this conversation

01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:31.800
about an hour ago, we first talked about how

01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:35.800
this whole accountability system, in order to just

01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:39.800
literally stand it up, took at least 15 different meetings

01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:43.800
from the State Board of Education. And so just to reiterate,

01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:47.800
we're coming back full circle. Prior to items coming towards the state board,

01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:51.800
the department has a practice of convening

01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:55.800
not only practitioners, but educational partners, community

01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:59.800
members to serve on policy groups. They're volunteers, I should say.

01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:03.800
They don't get paid to do this. And then we have a technical advisory board.

01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:07.800
And this is really a national standard that we hear from our peers

01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:11.800
in other states that they've set up. Actually, other states depend on

01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:15.800
institutes like higher education to do this work for them, to actually

01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:19.800
run dashboard calculations. Everything that Kimberly just described in Illinois,

01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:23.800
for example, the Illinois Institutes of Higher Education, there's a

01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:27.800
contract with them to do the work. So we are very fortunate in California that

01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:31.800
the state has invested in the State Education Agency, the California

01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:35.800
Department of Education specifically, to serve as your staff

01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:39.800
at the board to run calculations, to set

01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:43.800
recommendations for cut scores and so on. So your

01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:47.800
policy group, though, there is a requirement in federal law to have

01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:51.800
what is called a practitioner's advisory group. And so we call that

01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:55.800
affectionately CPAC, who meets a couple of times a year.

01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:59.800
And prior to anything coming before the board, we take this before CPAC. And there is

01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:03.800
a formal input process, just like there is for your

01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:07.800
meetings, who they are individuals that you've

01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:11.800
selected. And so they are meant to advise you on

01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:15.800
the items that we bring before them prior to it coming to you.

01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:19.800
So that is the cycle and the rhythm around input from

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:23.800
partners. And then we have taken the lead

01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:27.800
from Mao Vang and the assessments division, in which we do a summary

01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:31.800
when we do present items of all of the input

01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:35.800
that we've received or the webinars that we've conducted. And I have to

01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:39.800
tell you, we are now getting calls from other states. So we've talked to

01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:43.800
in the last year, New York, over the last couple of years, Kentucky, Tennessee,

01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:47.800
and we are on deck to talk to Maryland specifically about our English Learner Progress

01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:51.800
Indicator. So it's really exciting that there is a national presence

01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:55.800
for California's accountability system and that it's being recognized.

01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:59.800
We also are still seeing the

01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:03.800
legislature be very active in this space. And so I wanted to call to your attention

01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:07.800
a couple of bills. This probably doesn't cover everything, but this covers bills that have

01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:11.800
been chaptered and that we are absolutely paying attention to that impact

01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:15.800
the dashboard. So while LCFF stood as the fundamental

01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:19.800
piece of legislation that defined how the dashboard is created, these bills are starting

01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:23.800
to adjust or tinker with pieces of the dashboard.

01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:27.800
Specifically, the first two references are they totally

01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:31.800
allowed or rather gave the state the

01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:35.800
ability to suspend the dashboard, so not to use the data during COVID.

01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:39.800
So those are the first two bills. The third bill, I know Josh has referenced

01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:43.800
around, which is Senate Bill 75, talks about

01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:47.800
the development of objective criteria when the state had valid and reliable

01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:51.800
data. And as President Darling-Hammond mentioned, we just got that and we've just

01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:55.800
released that within the last two weeks. So we're real excited, very excited to move forward

01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:59.800
on that piece. And then finally, if we go back all the way to 2019,

01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:03.800
there was a change in EDCO that impacted

01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:07.800
how we report out data. And so we look at, for example,

01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:11.800
our A-G requirements next to our CTE data.

01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:15.800
So you see that now for our college career indicator.

01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:19.800
So just to close this out, and then I'll turn it over to President Darling-Hammond

01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:23.800
to go through clarifying questions and

01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:27.800
public comment. We do have a couple of pending items that you'll hear from us.

01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:31.800
We'll be back in September. It'll be a shorter presentation, I hope, but

01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:35.800
we have, next we've been asked to talk about

01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:39.800
accountability principles that were first really developed back

01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:43.800
when we originally put together the accountability system 2015-2016.

01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:47.800
So we've put an updated look on it, and

01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:51.800
we are seeking input and adoption around those

01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:55.800
in future meetings. We will also show you our communications toolkit,

01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:59.800
which we're really excited about. We've been talking to some statewide organizations

01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:03.800
around what is needed in that toolkit for this year, because as I mentioned,

01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:07.800
we have so many new staff, not only at the local level,

01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:11.800
but at districts and county offices of education. You will also, similar

01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:15.800
to what you did back in March, adopt the criteria for differentiated

01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:19.800
assistance for this one year, only using status. And then finally,

01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:23.800
we will be bringing forward to you the look of priority one,

01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:27.800
specifically where the link will go for the teaching assignment monitoring

01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:31.800
outcome data. So to close this out, these are

01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:35.800
the look beyond September, really 2023,

01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:39.800
2024, and actually into 2025. College

01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:43.800
Measures, we have not yet started collecting student level data around

01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:47.800
these two pieces, civic engagement or industry certifications,

01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:51.800
but they are absolutely something that is on our radar, and we are having

01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:55.800
regular discussions with our partners on the program side around

01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:59.800
this. The California science test is absolutely on our radar,

01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:03.800
as well as the student growth model. And then finally, we've already talked about this

01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:07.800
multiple times, establishing this objective criteria

01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:11.800
for any state level data that's collected that's relevant to priority one.

01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:15.800
So with that, I will turn it to President Darling-Hammond

01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:19.800
for clarifying questions and next steps.

01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:23.800
Thank you so much. I know it's a lot for

01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:27.800
everyone to process, but it is a

01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:31.800
complicated and sophisticated system,

01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:35.800
more so than many others as we've heard.

01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:39.800
I just want to frame as one of the liaisons

01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:43.800
that I'm going to ask Member Glover-Woods to also

01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:47.800
give us some framing as we wait for public comment

01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:51.800
and any clarifying questions, that

01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:55.800
the goal of a system, as we think about

01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:59.800
where we are and where we might want to go, is to really represent

01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:03.800
what we think is important about education. It should

01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:07.800
represent our vision, our philosophy for the

01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:11.800
ways in which people might understand and make

01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:15.800
progress in the education system to support children, to support

01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:19.800
educators, to support districts, and

01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:23.800
to enable the system to be well-informed.

01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:27.800
So just to kind of keep that frame on it, and I'm going to turn to

01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:31.800
Vice President Glover-Woods for any other liaison comments

01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:35.800
before we see about clarifying questions and public comment.

01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:39.800
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond, and thank you, Cindy

01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:43.800
and team, for just a very thorough and robust

01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:47.800
presentation, if you will, but really as it's

01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:51.800
listed, a study session on our accountability system. And so just a few

01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:55.800
comments before we go into public comment and have our discussion

01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:59.800
as a board. I have to say, as a

01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:03.800
practitioner in the field and also as a board member, how

01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:07.800
excited I am to see an accountability system that really looks

01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:11.800
at providing the data needed for decisions to be made at the

01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:15.800
local level. As was shared, our system is

01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:19.800
built on a few foundational principles, but the two

01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:23.800
that I feel are most key is that foundational principle of equity

01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:27.800
and also of continuous improvement. And what we've done

01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:31.800
is we've moved and navigated away from the name and shame

01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:35.800
game. I don't know if any of you remember when all the

01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:39.800
names of the schools would come out in the newspaper with the numbers next to them,

01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:43.800
and there was just a whole lot of conversation and discussion

01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:47.800
that didn't always end up in good results for

01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:51.800
students. It ended up in a lot of different places. So we've moved away

01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:55.800
from that to a system that I will admit is complex.

01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:59.800
It's more than a single number. It is really looking

01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:03.800
at all of these different areas that help our school systems

01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:07.800
to know how students are doing. An analogy I've used in the

01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:11.800
past is it's similar to when you go to the doctor. You don't just step on

01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:15.800
the scale and leave, and they just give you that one number to know how healthy you are

01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:19.800
and what areas you might need to improve in. There are multiple

01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:23.800
things that are looked at, blood pressure, and then if you do blood work, there are all these other numbers

01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:27.800
that are utilized to help us know how healthy we

01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:31.800
are, areas that we're doing well in, and areas that we need to improve in our system.

01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:35.800
Our accountability system has that same lens, and it also

01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:39.800
recognizes that it's more than just where we are at the time, which is our

01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:43.800
status, but also how things have evolved in student

01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:47.800
performance over time, which is the change. So quite excited about that.

01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:51.800
The last comment that I will make, and I will stop

01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:55.800
talking, I promise, is to just help to underscore

01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:59.800
how important in our lens of continuous improvement feedback

01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:03.800
is. Our system does not look the same as it did in 2017,

01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:07.800
and very intentionally so, as was shared in our presentation.

01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:11.800
There are a lot of indicators that have had the data

01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:15.800
markers shifted, changed, added,

01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:19.800
and that is indeed what we want to have happen, and

01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:23.800
a lot of that comes from that feedback from our educational partners, those who are

01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:27.800
in the field, those who work on policy, all those who are impacted

01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:31.800
on how student performance ends up. So looking quite

01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:35.800
forward to our future discussions in September and beyond,

01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:39.800
and again, I think this was a great example on how

01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:43.800
California has set the tone, and how to look at accountability

01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:47.800
for students across our nation.

01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:51.800
So thank you very much for allowing me to share my thoughts and ideas, and again, look

01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:55.800
forward to our discussion. Thank you. We're going to open

01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:59.800
the phone line for public comment, and then I'm going to come back for

01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:03.800
any brief clarifying questions. Members of the public wishing to provide comment

01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:07.800
on the item can do so by calling the telephone number and using the access

01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:11.800
code provided on the slide that is shown now, and so

01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:15.800
people can begin to queue up for that. Are there...

01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:19.800
I know there's a lot. Are there clarifying questions that anybody would like to ask at this time

01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:23.800
before we come back for discussion of

01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:27.800
the presentation and our thoughts about next steps?

01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:31.800
We're going to have more time for this on the September agenda too, so

01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:35.800
just so that you can understand how it will unfold.

01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:39.800
Any clarifying questions?

01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:43.800
I am not seeing any hands at the moment.

01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:47.800
Member Benanka? Yeah, thank you.

01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:51.800
First of all, thank you so much for that extremely informative

01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:55.800
and comprehensive presentation. In the presentation,

01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:59.800
I noticed that for the chronic absenteeism

01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:03.800
indicator, it was noted that it was only for

01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:07.800
displayed for grades K through 8 and not high schools.

01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:11.800
...

01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:15.800
...

01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:19.800
if it would be possible to add that indicator for high school

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:23.800
grades in the future. That's getting into

01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:27.800
a bigger policy question, but maybe we could just ask now why it's not currently

01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:31.800
used for high school.

01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:35.800
We actually should have probably put in this graphic, but there's a graphic that we've used in the past

01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:39.800
that shows the distribution of those academic indicators and those other

01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:43.800
indicators of success by grade level, so there needs to be a balance

01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:47.800
under ESSA by grade level for those.

01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:51.800
When the board approached the US Department of Education

01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:55.800
about the inclusion of chronic absenteeism, the compromise was

01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:59.800
we would use high school graduation rate as a proxy

01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:03.800
for chronic absenteeism. I want to be very clear. We collect

01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:07.800
chronic absenteeism for every single student in the state that's in K-12

01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:11.800
education. We report that data out and have reported that data out

01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:15.800
on DataQuest since we started collecting this information.

01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:19.800
In lieu of that information on the dashboard, it is absolutely

01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:23.800
available for every single student group, grade level,

01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:27.800
as well as by school, district, and state,

01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:31.800
and county comparisons on DataQuest. That's the balance.

01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:35.800
If the board wants to entertain this, we'd have to find an appropriate

01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:39.800
additional measure for our elementary

01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:43.800
schools to balance out those weights.

01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:47.800
I think that this is part of the bigger question.

01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:51.800
The Department of Education, as I noted, has

01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:55.800
flagged that they are willing to think differently about this question

01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:59.800
of what indicators, what weights for the indicators, then

01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:03.800
was the case in the initial framing of guidance from

01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:07.800
the Department of Education. The law would allow much more flexibility

01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:11.800
and California asked for many flexibilities. We didn't

01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:15.800
get all of them at the time. I think your question is timely

01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:19.800
and one that is a longer term question that could be taken up.

01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:23.800
Got it. Thank you for the explanation.

01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:27.800
Thank you. I don't see any other hands

01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:31.800
for clarifying questions, so we're going to move to public comments. I understand

01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:35.800
there are some callers in the queue. Yes, we have currently

01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:39.800
22 callers in the queue. I will open the phone line now. State

01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:43.800
Board of Education, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute.

01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:47.800
Your time starts now.

01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:53.800
Good morning. My name is Eduardo Munoz and I'm

01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:57.800
calling with regards to the consequences of the academic indicator

01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:01.800
and the LP with regards to

01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:05.800
identifying different types of English learners in the LCAT

01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:09.800
and I'm calling to urge that together with

01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:13.800
the arguments that will be presented by Californians together, that these

01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:17.800
LCAT scores are made more

01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:21.800
rigorous so that LCAPs

01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:25.800
in districts can actually reflect the needs of

01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:29.800
English learners and start presenting actions that are identifiable

01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:33.800
to support multilingual learners, which currently

01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:37.800
based on research, it is

01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:41.800
not shown. There is a dire need for our LCAPs to really

01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:45.800
reflect the needs of English learners and currently that is not happening.

01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:49.800
Addressing the issue of the LCAP scores would actually provide

01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:53.800
more conditions to identify that there is a need there.

01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:57.800
Thank you, Collie. Your time is up. Next caller, please state your name

01:50:57.800 --> 01:51:01.800
and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:09.800
Coller, you're alive.

01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:13.800
Next

01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:17.800
caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:21.800
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:25.800
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond,

01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:29.800
Superintendent Thurnman, Vice President Grover Woods, and members of the board.

01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:33.800
LeAngela Reed on behalf of the Small School Districts Association.

01:51:33.800 --> 01:51:37.800
SSDA would like to thank the board for their guidance and CDE for a thoughtful

01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:41.800
discussion of the state's accountability journey. It's clear we've made a great deal of progress.

01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:45.800
The involvement and empowerment provided at the local level is shown to be effective

01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:49.800
and truly a system of continuous improvement. As we move forward in shaping

01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:53.800
our accountability system and fine tuning the dashboard, SSDA would simply

01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:57.800
ask that we continue to move forward patiently and deliberately and resist

01:51:57.800 --> 01:52:01.800
the urge to add more to the dashboard too quickly. We've had a new LCAP template

01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:05.800
nearly every year, so we are constantly adjusting to new state requirements when the

01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:09.800
focus must be always on our students first. We don't want to lose quality

01:52:09.800 --> 01:52:13.800
because of a lack of capacity. However, by working together, we can continue to

01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:17.800
prioritize what is best for our students, our families, our staff,

01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:21.800
and our communities. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller, please

01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:25.800
state your name and affiliation. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:29.800
Hi, my name is

01:52:29.800 --> 01:52:33.800
Ali Mazoda, and I'm an equity fellow at Children Now and a student at Northwestern

01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:37.800
University. Positive school climate is crucial. Students need to feel

01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:41.800
safe on campus and have connections with adults in order to achieve their full potential.

01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:45.800
Having a caring relationship with at least one adult at school is proven to be

01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:49.800
critical to student well-being, yet only 57% of California's ninth graders

01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:53.800
report having such connections. There's a clear issue at hand, yet this data

01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:57.800
cannot be linked to specific school sites with the current system. As someone

01:52:57.800 --> 01:53:01.800
who has gone through the California education system recently, I know I benefited

01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:05.800
from feeling safe on my campuses and having connections to my teachers. Thus,

01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:09.800
I hope the board can see the importance of school climate and place more emphasis on student

01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:13.800
surveys and the accountability system by first, conducting the surveys

01:53:13.800 --> 01:53:17.800
annually, second, having a small subset of standardized questions,

01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:21.800
and third, reporting actual results statewide to engage the public on

01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:25.800
these issues. Thank you, Dr. Darling-Hammond and board members.

01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:29.800
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation. You have one minute. Your time

01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:33.800
starts now.

01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:37.800
Thank you, Dr. Darling-Hammond and board members.

01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:41.800
My name is Noah Bernicki and I'm an Equity Fellow for Children Now and a student

01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:45.800
at Georgetown University. I would like to comment today on the English Learner Progress Indicator.

01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:49.800
As a former English learner myself, I understand how crucial English proficiency

01:53:49.800 --> 01:53:53.800
is to academic success. The research-based expectations for students

01:53:53.800 --> 01:53:57.800
who start the lowest level of English to be reclassified within five to seven years, which

01:53:57.800 --> 01:54:01.800
relies on them making annual improvement. However, for a district to be classified

01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:05.800
as doing well, only 55% of their English learners need to make progress every year.

01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:09.800
However, this allows almost half of students to not improve and not be on track

01:54:09.800 --> 01:54:13.800
to meet those research-based targets without any red flags being graved.

01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:17.800
As a result, thousands of kids in California enter ELD in kindergarten, yet do not reach

01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:21.800
proficiency by sixth grade. During this time, they accumulate content gaps in other subjects

01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:25.800
that continue to widen until they achieve English mastery. In order to support

01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:29.800
English learner students better, the LP standards for districts need to be raised to align

01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:33.800
better with research and promote higher outcomes. Thank you.

01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:37.800
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time

01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:41.800
starts now.

01:54:41.800 --> 01:54:45.800
Good morning. This is Dr. Hayen Kimner with the California Community Schools Learning

01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:49.800
Exchange. Much thanks to the State Board and the CDE staff for that

01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:53.800
extraordinary update on a consistent and rigorous process

01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:57.800
to continue to measure the things that matter and how to use that information

01:54:57.800 --> 01:55:01.800
to support school districts and partners to advance comprehensive

01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:05.800
student well-being. CSLX continues to carefully look

01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:09.800
at the several important developments in policy and funding that must be

01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:13.800
coherent and aligned to support strong, effective, and sustainable

01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:17.800
community school systems and strategies. We strongly encourage the

01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:21.800
departments, community school partners, and technical assistance providers to center

01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:25.800
the comprehensive work of the Dashboard as a core component of planning

01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:29.800
and implementation. This includes all of the indicators and priorities, not

01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:33.800
just those that might traditionally be seen as the domain of community schools, like

01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:37.800
parent and family engagement or school climate. If the Dashboard is meant to

01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:41.800
truly be a reflection of a whole child and whole system strategy,

01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:45.800
we must also continue to silo the data and who and why

01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:49.800
it matters in practice. Thanks so much. Thank you. Next caller,

01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:53.800
please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

01:55:53.800 --> 01:55:57.800
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond

01:55:57.800 --> 01:56:01.800
and State Board members. My name is Sarah Arce, and I am an Equity Fellow with Children Now

01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:05.800
and a graduate student at UCI. The current college and career indicator appears

01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:09.800
to undervalue the role of work-based learning in meeting workplace demands for students.

01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:13.800
Currently, 64.2% of students from low socioeconomic backgrounds

01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:17.800
do not meet a level of preparedness under the CCI upon high school graduation.

01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:21.800
These students are not graduating with the skills and resources necessary

01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:25.800
to succeed in their following endeavors. Additionally, 43% of students,

01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:29.800
including those of low socioeconomic backgrounds, work their way through college, so it is

01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:33.800
imperative that students graduate from high school with both academic and work skills.

01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:37.800
First, the board must incentivize districts to value work-based learning

01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:41.800
by expanding options to demonstrate career readiness, including internships and job

01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:45.800
shadowing opportunities. Second, it would be beneficial to establish an

01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:49.800
equity-prepared level of rating on the CCI that would demonstrate that the students are

01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:53.800
both college-ready and career-ready. Thank you.

01:56:53.800 --> 01:56:57.800
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

01:56:57.800 --> 01:57:01.800
Good morning,

01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:05.800
President Darling-Hammond and other board members.

01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:09.800
Liz Guillen with Public Advocates for the LCFS Equity Coalition.

01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:13.800
We commend the department for taking the opportunity to refresh the board on

01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:17.800
our accountability system. Our colleagues Cindy Kim and Josh did an amazing

01:57:17.800 --> 01:57:21.800
job in their overview. The coalition has continuously advocated

01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:25.800
that the CCI is a measure of both college and career,

01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:29.800
not one or the other, to ensure that our state's goal is for all

01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:33.800
students to have equal opportunities to succeed in college and

01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:37.800
career readiness. We urge the board to

01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:41.800
make clear that the state's goal is for both

01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:45.800
post-secondary life preparation and today's economy

01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:49.800
that's both college and career, not one or the other. We share

01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:53.800
our excitement and thanks with President Darling-Hammond about the work related to

01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:57.800
the teaching assignment monitoring data and we encourage

01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:01.800
the board and the department to conduct an analysis

01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:05.800
of the available teacher assignment data by student group

01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:09.800
and include that information on the dashboard and an additional report

01:58:09.800 --> 01:58:13.800
such as the school accountability report card.

01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:17.800
We want a greater understanding by students, families and the public

01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:21.800
about this.

01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:25.800
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time

01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:29.800
starts now.

01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:33.800
Hi, my name is

01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:37.800
Leticia Garcia on behalf of Riverside County Superintendent of Schools.

01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:41.800
The pandemic impacted our students and families in many ways and

01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:45.800
LEAs know that meeting the academic and social emotional needs of their students is critical.

01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:49.800
We agree with CDE staff that if we return to hold LEAs accountable

01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:53.800
for student outcomes, it's important to remember how we got here and a study

01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:57.800
session accomplishes this goal. The dashboard is the flashlight

01:58:57.800 --> 01:59:01.800
of our accountability system, a system rooted in the principle of continuous

01:59:01.800 --> 01:59:05.800
improvement that allows LEAs to learn which strategies most likely

01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:09.800
lead to student success. The mix of state and local indicators in the

01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:13.800
dashboard are the foundation of our accountability system and align to

01:59:13.800 --> 01:59:17.800
LCFF priorities and ESSA measures, providing a fuller picture

01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:21.800
of student outcomes. The robust level of information helps

01:59:21.800 --> 01:59:25.800
drive local conversation to make the necessary changes that best

01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:29.800
meet the needs of their students. We stand ready to work with the board and our

01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:33.800
colleagues to do the same at the statewide level. Thank you.

01:59:33.800 --> 01:59:37.800
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute.

01:59:37.800 --> 01:59:41.800
Your time starts now.

01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:49.800
Caller, you are live. Please state your name and affiliation.

01:59:49.800 --> 01:59:53.800
Okay, moving on.

01:59:53.800 --> 01:59:57.800
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

01:59:57.800 --> 02:00:01.800
Hi, good morning. My name is Patti Chavez.

02:00:01.800 --> 02:00:05.800
I'm from Chula Vista, California and I'm representing Parent Institute for Quality Education,

02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:09.800
part of the LCFF Equity Coalition and in partnership with

02:00:09.800 --> 02:00:13.800
Californians Together. Thank you all for your dedication and such wonderful

02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:17.800
presentations. As a family engagement and education nonprofit serving

02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:21.800
EL populations across California, we work to empower parents

02:00:21.800 --> 02:00:25.800
to engage in their children's education. Part of that engagement

02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:29.800
includes having accurate information about the academic standing of their students

02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:33.800
to better target, support and advocate for LCAP funding.

02:00:33.800 --> 02:00:37.800
LCAPs give our families and us as education advocates

02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:41.800
the insight we need to identify where programs and services are needed

02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:45.800
and set goals and standards for our districts. Our families tell us

02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:49.800
very often because of knowledge and tools, they no longer just have a

02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:53.800
dream but can actually create a plan for success and it's working.

02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:57.800
We hope you will ensure that the outcomes and needs of EL students and other populations

02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:01.800
in need are clearly articulated in our LCAP so we can

02:01:01.800 --> 02:01:05.800
work together to provide them with the support they deserve.

02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:09.800
Thank you all very much. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:13.800
for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:17.800
Good morning. Michelle Holcomb,

02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:21.800
Executive Director for the California Association of Science Educators.

02:01:21.800 --> 02:01:25.800
On behalf of CASE members and the Science Coalition, we would like to thank President Farley Hammond,

02:01:25.800 --> 02:01:29.800
State Superintendent Tony Thurmond and CDE for continued development

02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:33.800
of science as an indicator on the dashboard and the State Board of Education

02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:37.800
for maintaining strong commitment to including a science indicator.

02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:41.800
We know that multiple years of CAS data are required in order to set performance

02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:45.800
and growth levels and that this data will not be available until the results

02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:49.800
of the 2023 administration in order to determine feasibility of its

02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:53.800
inclusion on the dashboard. Yet as districts begin developing their LCAP

02:01:53.800 --> 02:01:57.800
plans, they are directed to look to the dashboard for guidance on setting priorities.

02:01:57.800 --> 02:02:01.800
With the science indicator absent from the dashboard, many districts are

02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:05.800
at risk of further deprioritizing science instruction. An information

02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:09.800
only item on the dashboard will send a strong signal to districts to plan for

02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:13.800
and invest in science now. Thank you. Thank you.

02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:17.800
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:21.800
Hi, I'm Todd Collins. I'm a board member

02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:25.800
in Palo Alto Unified and I also serve on your practitioner advisory group.

02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:29.800
I shared more detailed written comments with you earlier and I hope you'll have a chance to read

02:02:29.800 --> 02:02:33.800
them. My main point is that despite its obvious good intentions, our accountability

02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:37.800
system and dashboard do not meet the most crucial needs of the local school board

02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:41.800
members like me. They don't actually help us improve. Further,

02:02:41.800 --> 02:02:45.800
they don't meet the most critical needs of parents, which is to choose the best schools for their children.

02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:49.800
I've asked a large number of district leaders, school board members and families

02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:53.800
all over the state that they found the dashboard important in guiding their work.

02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:57.800
I'm sorry to report to you that a large majority say they do not. Most board members

02:02:57.800 --> 02:03:01.800
never look at it. Most district leaders don't attend to it and very few families

02:03:01.800 --> 02:03:05.800
make any use of it at all. It's become mostly a compliance tool. I hope you'll

02:03:05.800 --> 02:03:09.800
take a chance today to step back and reflect on this and try to meet the most important

02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:13.800
needs of school boards and parents. I know we can do better if we try. Thanks for

02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:17.800
the opportunity to address you and thanks for your service to California's 6 million students.

02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:21.800
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:25.800
for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:29.800
Hello. My name is Dr. Lina Bakshi, board secretary

02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:33.800
for the California Association for Science Educators and executive director

02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:37.800
of the nonprofit STEM4Real where we provide science and mathematics

02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:41.800
professional learning through a justice-centered lens. I want to echo support for science

02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:45.800
as an indicator on the California dashboard. California administrators have

02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:49.800
actively advised elementary teachers not to teach science and to focus on

02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:53.800
mathematics and ELA since that is what is seen on the California dashboard.

02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:57.800
This creates a drastic inequity starting in the elementary years.

02:03:57.800 --> 02:04:01.800
It's impossible to catch up. Science is an equity issue with

02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:05.800
big differences in access to STEM careers for different groups of students,

02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:09.800
particularly our marginalized students. Science could be included sooner

02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:13.800
as an information-only item. If it is not measured

02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:17.800
or tested, it is unfortunately not taught and best learning is lost.

02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:21.800
I truly want to thank Dr. Darling-Hammond and the board

02:04:21.800 --> 02:04:25.800
for your time and for this opportunity to speak. Thank you so much.

02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:29.800
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:33.800
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

02:04:33.800 --> 02:04:37.800
Good morning. My name is Ruth Brajas with Californians Together.

02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:41.800
I'd like to draw your attention today to the low expectations signaled

02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:45.800
by the current cut scores for the English Language Proficiency Indicator, LP.

02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:49.800
We agree with the rationale for designated six levels of LP

02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:53.800
which aligns with the research documenting that it takes five to seven years for ELs

02:04:53.800 --> 02:04:57.800
to become proficient in English. We also agree that making one level growth

02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:01.800
is realistic for the majority of ELs. However, the current cut scores create

02:05:01.800 --> 02:05:05.800
complacency in a system where the majority of ELs have not grown one level every year.

02:05:05.800 --> 02:05:09.800
Current cut scores identify districts' status as low in red

02:05:09.800 --> 02:05:13.800
when just 35% or less of the ELs grow one level and identify

02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:17.800
high status if a little more than half of the ELs grow one level.

02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:21.800
Half is not an ambitious long-term goal that the cut scores are intended to be.

02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:25.800
In a truly equity-focused system, expectations should be set

02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:29.800
based on the outcomes that we want, not the outcomes that have been

02:05:29.800 --> 02:05:33.800
inequitable that have been reduced in years past. We ask the board to revise the cut scores for LP.

02:05:33.800 --> 02:05:37.800
We can do better. Thank you.

02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:41.800
Caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now. You have one minute.

02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:45.800
Good morning, Dr. Darling-Hammond

02:05:45.800 --> 02:05:49.800
and board members. Diana Vu, on behalf of the Association of Kaplaner School

02:05:49.800 --> 02:05:53.800
Administrators, acts to appreciate the board and CD's thoughtful consideration of the

02:05:53.800 --> 02:05:57.800
state's accountability system as it resumes after a two-year hiatus due to a global

02:05:57.800 --> 02:06:01.800
pandemic. This includes item two's detailed

02:06:01.800 --> 02:06:05.800
refresher. As the state proceeds with implementing updates and

02:06:05.800 --> 02:06:09.800
revisions to the accountability system, such as inclusion of the teacher

02:06:09.800 --> 02:06:13.800
assignment data onto the dashboard, ACSA looks forward to the continued collaboration

02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:17.800
to ensure the voices of educators who directly interact and

02:06:17.800 --> 02:06:21.800
impact California's six million students are reflected in any changes made.

02:06:21.800 --> 02:06:25.800
Thank you again to the board and CD for your work on this very important issue.

02:06:25.800 --> 02:06:29.800
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one

02:06:29.800 --> 02:06:33.800
minute. Your time starts now.

02:06:33.800 --> 02:06:37.800
Hello, Madam President. This is Brian Revis speaking on behalf

02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:41.800
of the Education Trust West. We agree with our partners at the

02:06:41.800 --> 02:06:45.800
California Association of Science Educators about the importance

02:06:45.800 --> 02:06:49.800
of placing science assessment results on the dashboard.

02:06:49.800 --> 02:06:53.800
Science achievement isn't going well, and that's especially true for

02:06:53.800 --> 02:06:57.800
students of color, and it's affecting college access because

02:06:57.800 --> 02:07:01.800
frequently science is a problem area when it comes to completing A

02:07:01.800 --> 02:07:05.800
through G requirements. We need science to be present when

02:07:05.800 --> 02:07:09.800
LEAs develop their LCAPs and allocate resources,

02:07:09.800 --> 02:07:13.800
so we think placing science assessment results on the dashboard

02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:17.800
is an important way to do that, and I also want to say thank you to those

02:07:17.800 --> 02:07:21.800
of you who advised the governor and his team on the budget for

02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:25.800
the $85 million that was included in the budget for STEM teacher

02:07:25.800 --> 02:07:29.800
professional development. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller,

02:07:29.800 --> 02:07:33.800
please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

02:07:33.800 --> 02:07:37.800
Good morning. My name is Jenny Snyder,

02:07:37.800 --> 02:07:41.800
the current chair of the Successive Curriculum and Instruction Steering Committee, calling

02:07:41.800 --> 02:07:45.800
on behalf of the 58th County Superintendents of Schools.

02:07:45.800 --> 02:07:49.800
Successive would like to thank the CDE for such a comprehensive

02:07:49.800 --> 02:07:53.800
presentation today. Your leadership over the past two years through the

02:07:53.800 --> 02:07:57.800
pandemic pause of our accountability system. Thank you.

02:07:57.800 --> 02:08:01.800
As county offices, we find the dashboard to be a useful tool in assisting

02:08:01.800 --> 02:08:05.800
LEAs in identifying areas of need for improvement. As such, we have

02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:09.800
greatly valued the opportunities to engage with the CDE to provide recommendations

02:08:09.800 --> 02:08:13.800
so that the data reported to the dashboard provides the most accurate picture

02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:17.800
of performance. Newly collected data are going to be incorporated

02:08:17.800 --> 02:08:21.800
into the dashboard in coming years. To protect the validity and reliability

02:08:21.800 --> 02:08:25.800
of the dashboard, we respectfully request that there be ample opportunities

02:08:25.800 --> 02:08:29.800
for LEA recommendations prior to decisions being made as to how

02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:33.800
these new data will be reported and calculated for accountability

02:08:33.800 --> 02:08:37.800
purposes. Thank you. Thank you.

02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:41.800
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

02:08:45.800 --> 02:08:49.800
President Darling-Hammond and board members Shelly Stiegel-Coleman, Californians

02:08:49.800 --> 02:08:53.800
Together. Districts are guided by the data from the dashboard to determine

02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:57.800
which student populations to address in their LCAP. We request a

02:08:57.800 --> 02:09:01.800
review of the definition of the EL population to disaggregate

02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:05.800
English learner only from RFEPs for the academic indicator.

02:09:05.800 --> 02:09:09.800
Our three-year LCAP reports in the fourth to be available in September

02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:13.800
document that very few districts include goals, metrics,

02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:17.800
and growth targets for ELs resulting in masking their performance

02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:21.800
level on the dashboard. An additional concern for aggregated

02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:25.800
score is demonstrated by the current geo region, which includes

02:09:25.800 --> 02:09:29.800
current LA Fresno, Ventura and Santa Barbara, and

02:09:29.800 --> 02:09:33.800
San Luis Obispo enrolling 34% of the state's ELs.

02:09:33.800 --> 02:09:37.800
Only one school district is designated for DA for English

02:09:37.800 --> 02:09:41.800
learners, an underrepresentation of districts needing support

02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:45.800
for English learners. We welcome an opportunity to engage with the board

02:09:45.800 --> 02:09:49.800
and the department to review this indicator. Thank you. Thank you.

02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:53.800
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now. You have one minute.

02:09:53.800 --> 02:09:57.800
Good morning. My name is

02:09:57.800 --> 02:10:01.800
Lucero Chavez with the Parent Institute for Quality Education, DICA,

02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:05.800
part of the LCFF Equity Coalition and in partnership with Californians Together.

02:10:05.800 --> 02:10:09.800
We are a family engagement and education nonprofit serving more

02:10:09.800 --> 02:10:13.800
than 18,000 families annually across California, including English learners.

02:10:13.800 --> 02:10:17.800
And today we want to emphasize the importance of disaggregating English

02:10:17.800 --> 02:10:21.800
learners and reclassified English learners in the academic indicator.

02:10:21.800 --> 02:10:25.800
Aggregating scores masks real outcomes, possibly giving the impression that

02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:29.800
students are doing better than they are. At Pique, our mission is to empower

02:10:29.800 --> 02:10:33.800
families with knowledge and skills to actively participate in their children's education.

02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:37.800
And our parents are ready to support their students, but they need the accurate data

02:10:37.800 --> 02:10:41.800
to do so. As an RFEP myself, I also know that students

02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:45.800
need to change as they become proficient, and tracking when they do can help us

02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:49.800
better understand their journey to proficiency. We ask that you take note on the

02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:53.800
importance of differentiating our English learner populations as you make decisions

02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:57.800
and create systems to best support our students. And thank you so much

02:10:57.800 --> 02:11:01.800
for your service to the state of California. Thank you. Next

02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:05.800
caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:13.800
Good morning, members of the State Board of Education.

02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:17.800
My name is Luis Manuel Bonrostro, Associate Director of Policy

02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:21.800
at Californians Together, and I'm calling to draw your attention

02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:25.800
to the consequences that the current cut scores for the LP

02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:29.800
might have on our education system, especially given the low expectations

02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:33.800
that were previously mentioned.

02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:37.800
We want to see more urgency in the system, and we're concerned

02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:41.800
that in a state where the majority of ELs did not make growth

02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:45.800
from one level to the next, we're not going to be able to see that with the current

02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:49.800
cut scores. So with the 2019 data that was released,

02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:53.800
we saw that less than 1% of school districts, 20 school

02:11:53.800 --> 02:11:57.800
districts to be exact, would be identified as

02:11:57.800 --> 02:12:01.800
needing attention to help ELs. This would represent less than 1%

02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:05.800
of English learners in the state when we know that the need is so much

02:12:05.800 --> 02:12:09.800
larger than that. So we are concerned that the cut scores will continue

02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:13.800
to mask the real need by districts and schools.

02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:17.800
Thank you, Coller. Your time is up. Thank you.

02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:21.800
Next, Coller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now. You have one minute.

02:12:21.800 --> 02:12:25.800
Good morning,

02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:29.800
members of the State Board of Education. My name is Eric Alvarez, Policy

02:12:29.800 --> 02:12:33.800
Associate at Californians Together. Along with other recommendations

02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:37.800
we've mentioned this morning, I would like to highlight

02:12:37.800 --> 02:12:41.800
the board's recommendation to revise the cut scores for LP with a new measure

02:12:41.800 --> 02:12:45.800
other than the bell curve. We asked the board

02:12:45.800 --> 02:12:49.800
to revise the cut scores for the LP with a new measure

02:12:49.800 --> 02:12:53.800
that is based on what an equity-focused system should be producing.

02:12:53.800 --> 02:12:57.800
Thank you. Next, Coller, please state your name

02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:01.800
and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

02:13:01.800 --> 02:13:05.800
Hi, I'm Martha Hernandez with

02:13:05.800 --> 02:13:09.800
Californians Together, and we applaud the work of CDE and staff on this

02:13:09.800 --> 02:13:13.800
critical issue. Since the inception of the equity-focused

02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:17.800
local control funding formula a decade ago, Californians Together

02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:21.800
has been engaged in efforts to ensure that the accountability system

02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:25.800
fulfills the promise of equity, parity, and continuous improvement for

02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:29.800
English learners. With the intent to make the system better, there are issues

02:13:29.800 --> 02:13:33.800
yet to be resolved, including the lack of setting ambitious LP

02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:37.800
goals and addressing the obscuring of the actual academic

02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:41.800
needs of both English learner only and reclassified fluent English proficient

02:13:41.800 --> 02:13:45.800
students, which results in a lack of urgency to meet their

02:13:45.800 --> 02:13:49.800
needs in LCAPs, failure to set growth targets and therefore

02:13:49.800 --> 02:13:53.800
closed gaps, and failure to provide support to districts to

02:13:53.800 --> 02:13:57.800
increase their effectiveness in increasing English learner growth and achievement

02:13:57.800 --> 02:14:01.800
through the system of support. We stand ready to assist in

02:14:01.800 --> 02:14:05.800
working with your staff on this critical issue. Thank you. Thank you very

02:14:05.800 --> 02:14:09.800
much for an outstanding presentation. Thank you.

02:14:09.800 --> 02:14:13.800
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your

02:14:13.800 --> 02:14:17.800
time starts now.

02:14:17.800 --> 02:14:21.800
Good morning

02:14:21.800 --> 02:14:25.800
chair and board members. My name is Sally Fox, and I'm representing the California

02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:29.800
Association for Bilingual Education. In light of all the

02:14:29.800 --> 02:14:33.800
comments you've heard from members of Californians together, we would like to offer these comments

02:14:33.800 --> 02:14:37.800
and recommendations. Including a growth model in California

02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:41.800
schools accountability systems has been a positive step forward toward

02:14:41.800 --> 02:14:45.800
equity and transparency and for our English learner programs

02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:49.800
effectiveness. We believe it is wise to examine results regularly

02:14:49.800 --> 02:14:53.800
to be sure the data we are using to make decisions are

02:14:53.800 --> 02:14:57.800
richly contextualized and appropriate. In fact, this has been a

02:14:57.800 --> 02:15:01.800
concern of ours for several years, which is why we continue to recommend the

02:15:01.800 --> 02:15:05.800
revision of the definition of ELs for the academic indicator

02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:09.800
and that we report ELs and RFEPs separately.

02:15:09.800 --> 02:15:13.800
We believe the growth model should include the reporting of current

02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:17.800
ELs and RFEPs when constructing the model.

02:15:17.800 --> 02:15:21.800
Thank you for the opportunity to share our perspective. Thank you.

02:15:21.800 --> 02:15:25.800
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time

02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:29.800
starts now.

02:15:29.800 --> 02:15:33.800
This is Suzanne Cooey of the Charter Schools Development Center.

02:15:33.800 --> 02:15:37.800
We appreciate the excellent work of CDE staff on the dashboard and also

02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:41.800
appreciate board members comments to pull out to the bigger picture.

02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:45.800
CDSBC urges the board to ensure that information on the dashboard

02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:49.800
helps educators assess growth in student performance.

02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:53.800
We care about student performance level,

02:15:53.800 --> 02:15:57.800
but also it is not only the score that matters, it's how far the school

02:15:57.800 --> 02:16:01.800
is taking students and how quickly schools are helping

02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:05.800
students progress. And it does matter what challenges those students

02:16:05.800 --> 02:16:09.800
bring. That's how we should be looking at school quality. That's what school

02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:13.800
quality is about. CDSBC urges the board to take the steps

02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:17.800
necessary to identify school quality accurately. This may be

02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:21.800
by providing additional information, by conducting outreach as to

02:16:21.800 --> 02:16:25.800
appropriate use of the dashboard metrics, by adjusting metrics,

02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:29.800
and through sound use of growth data. As an example,

02:16:29.800 --> 02:16:33.800
we can see the difficulty with the LP metric, which

02:16:33.800 --> 02:16:37.800
does reflect- Thank you, caller. Your time is up.

02:16:37.800 --> 02:16:41.800
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:45.800
for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

02:16:45.800 --> 02:16:49.800
Good morning. This is Sarah Lillis,

02:16:49.800 --> 02:16:53.800
Executive Director of Teach Plus California. We also want to thank you for taking

02:16:53.800 --> 02:16:57.800
the time to have this important study session. When California passed LCFS

02:16:57.800 --> 02:17:01.800
nearly a decade ago to begin to address these long-standing inequities in our education system,

02:17:01.800 --> 02:17:05.800
we recognized a key part of this comprehensive proposal was a more robust

02:17:05.800 --> 02:17:09.800
accountability system with multiple meaningful measures of school performance,

02:17:09.800 --> 02:17:13.800
a focus on subgroup performance, and a system of support that fosters

02:17:13.800 --> 02:17:17.800
continuous improvement. We appreciate all the work that's been done to continue to improve

02:17:17.800 --> 02:17:21.800
the measures on our dashboard. As outlined in the letters from both

02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:25.800
the LCFS Equity Coalition and the Alliance for Students, we believe that there

02:17:25.800 --> 02:17:29.800
are future opportunities to continue to improve this system,

02:17:29.800 --> 02:17:33.800
including progress on the teacher data that's already been made but continuing to push

02:17:33.800 --> 02:17:37.800
on that, the urgency of really getting to a student growth model,

02:17:37.800 --> 02:17:41.800
improving our alternative school measures,

02:17:41.800 --> 02:17:45.800
the science assessment, as has been mentioned, the work on the LP, the expectations

02:17:45.800 --> 02:17:49.800
for the LP, as has been mentioned by my colleagues, as well as

02:17:49.800 --> 02:17:53.800
really focusing on the balance of indicators on the dashboard. Our teachers are eager

02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:57.800
to continue this work with you and hope that this is the start of a

02:17:57.800 --> 02:18:01.800
new set of conversations, and thank you for your time and attention.

02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:05.800
Thank you. That concludes public comment for item number two.

02:18:09.800 --> 02:18:13.800
Thank you so much. Lots of interesting

02:18:13.800 --> 02:18:17.800
and useful comments from the public. We really appreciate those

02:18:17.800 --> 02:18:21.800
who took the time to do that. At this point, I want to open the

02:18:21.800 --> 02:18:25.800
floor for conversation. I'll just add

02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:29.800
one comment, which is that there were some remarks in the

02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:33.800
public comment about the importance of being careful,

02:18:33.800 --> 02:18:37.800
taking things slowly enough to know what the impacts would

02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:41.800
be, really being deliberate in the

02:18:41.800 --> 02:18:45.800
process of considering next steps, and I just wanted to

02:18:45.800 --> 02:18:49.800
reinforce that that has been the priority of this board

02:18:49.800 --> 02:18:53.800
in creating this dashboard. Each one of those indicators

02:18:53.800 --> 02:18:57.800
was evaluated, discussed,

02:18:57.800 --> 02:19:01.800
modeled in the data set with data coming back to the

02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:05.800
board, and discussed further. Very, very careful

02:19:05.800 --> 02:19:09.800
process, and it would be our intention to continue

02:19:09.800 --> 02:19:13.800
that process. There was an era in earlier accountability

02:19:13.800 --> 02:19:17.800
areas where various kinds of measures were

02:19:17.800 --> 02:19:21.800
quickly constructed and thrown into the mix in various

02:19:21.800 --> 02:19:25.800
states across the country with unintended

02:19:25.800 --> 02:19:29.800
consequences. I think California

02:19:29.800 --> 02:19:33.800
Board learned the lesson of being careful, deliberate, and

02:19:33.800 --> 02:19:37.800
engaged with the public on the process.

02:19:37.800 --> 02:19:41.800
Who would like to make any comments? We can both ask

02:19:41.800 --> 02:19:45.800
questions and sort of flag things that we want to be sure to talk about.

02:19:45.800 --> 02:19:49.800
Remember, this is going to be on the agenda again in September, so some of what we're doing

02:19:49.800 --> 02:19:53.800
is building that agenda today.

02:19:53.800 --> 02:19:57.800
Member Escobedo.

02:19:57.800 --> 02:20:01.800
Again, I want to commend our staff and also

02:20:01.800 --> 02:20:05.800
board members in the past who really helped create this amazing

02:20:05.800 --> 02:20:09.800
structure. I know as the superintendent,

02:20:09.800 --> 02:20:13.800
we looked at this data very, very carefully

02:20:13.800 --> 02:20:17.800
in my previous life. As you well know,

02:20:17.800 --> 02:20:21.800
looking at that conversation, that collaboration

02:20:21.800 --> 02:20:25.800
around data is so key. I do

02:20:25.800 --> 02:20:29.800
know that the window of testing ends in this month.

02:20:29.800 --> 02:20:33.800
I just wonder, just looking at a way

02:20:33.800 --> 02:20:37.800
to get this data to the hands of our educators

02:20:37.800 --> 02:20:41.800
before December, I would hope we can look

02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:45.800
at that, knowing that every

02:20:45.800 --> 02:20:49.800
district has a different beginning and ending time, but

02:20:49.800 --> 02:20:53.800
I do believe that whether we phase in the data

02:20:53.800 --> 02:20:57.800
or parts of the data, but I

02:20:57.800 --> 02:21:01.800
think having these conversations earlier for school

02:21:01.800 --> 02:21:05.800
districts will be very critical, because again,

02:21:05.800 --> 02:21:09.800
those conversations, those collaborations that site

02:21:09.800 --> 02:21:13.800
principals have among each other, teachers with

02:21:13.800 --> 02:21:17.800
teachers and teachers among each other is critical. I do know

02:21:17.800 --> 02:21:21.800
districts do download the data and they

02:21:21.800 --> 02:21:25.800
create their own dashboard, many of them do, but

02:21:25.800 --> 02:21:29.800
nonetheless, I just wonder if we can look at that.

02:21:29.800 --> 02:21:33.800
Additionally, the whole issue of

02:21:33.800 --> 02:21:37.800
how do we assess climate?

02:21:37.800 --> 02:21:41.800
I think we need to think in a very methodical

02:21:41.800 --> 02:21:45.800
way how to go beyond suspension rates.

02:21:45.800 --> 02:21:49.800
Now that we have a lot of these community

02:21:49.800 --> 02:21:53.800
schools being built and

02:21:53.800 --> 02:21:57.800
using some type of assessment tool, I think

02:21:57.800 --> 02:22:01.800
that is

02:22:01.800 --> 02:22:05.800
standardized throughout the state, I think would be very

02:22:05.800 --> 02:22:09.800
important for us to incorporate in the future as

02:22:09.800 --> 02:22:13.800
we test and learn more. I think we need to have a

02:22:13.800 --> 02:22:17.800
more robust way to access how

02:22:17.800 --> 02:22:21.800
our learning cultures and

02:22:21.800 --> 02:22:25.800
climate, how are they improving at a school site?

02:22:25.800 --> 02:22:29.800
Thank you so much. I'm going to suggest that

02:22:29.800 --> 02:22:33.800
the staff keep track of any implicit questions

02:22:33.800 --> 02:22:37.800
that you want to give us some answers to, but I'm going to take

02:22:37.800 --> 02:22:41.800
a couple more comments and we can kind of store up a

02:22:41.800 --> 02:22:45.800
sense of what we want to know more about and explore.

02:22:45.800 --> 02:22:49.800
Member Rodriguez and then Member

02:22:49.800 --> 02:22:53.800
Orozco-Gonzalez and then Member Patio-Bronson and then Member

02:22:53.800 --> 02:22:57.800
Lewis. Good morning everyone. Thank you

02:22:57.800 --> 02:23:01.800
President Darlene Hammond and thank you staff

02:23:01.800 --> 02:23:05.800
for this incredible overview.

02:23:05.800 --> 02:23:09.800
I feel like I was looking at my life in reverse.

02:23:09.800 --> 02:23:13.800
There was a period

02:23:13.800 --> 02:23:17.800
when I ran into President Darlene Hammond in Washington, D.C. at a

02:23:17.800 --> 02:23:21.800
teaching and learning conference. This was 2012

02:23:21.800 --> 02:23:25.800
and I was in tears ready to leave the teaching profession

02:23:25.800 --> 02:23:29.800
and she told me, hang in there. There are

02:23:29.800 --> 02:23:33.800
great things coming down the pipe in California.

02:23:33.800 --> 02:23:37.800
We just saw how it unfolded.

02:23:37.800 --> 02:23:41.800
This presentation that

02:23:41.800 --> 02:23:45.800
as a lot of these policies and changes have

02:23:45.800 --> 02:23:49.800
happened here in California, starting with the LCFF,

02:23:49.800 --> 02:23:53.800
because

02:23:53.800 --> 02:23:57.800
it's a shift in mindset and

02:23:57.800 --> 02:24:01.800
what I see sometimes at my school site

02:24:01.800 --> 02:24:05.800
is that there's still

02:24:05.800 --> 02:24:09.800
some of the

02:24:09.800 --> 02:24:13.800
scars and the wounds left from NCLB

02:24:13.800 --> 02:24:17.800
and when we talk about

02:24:17.800 --> 02:24:21.800
being trauma-informed educators, there's still some of that

02:24:21.800 --> 02:24:25.800
and that feeling of punishment

02:24:25.800 --> 02:24:29.800
still lives in

02:24:29.800 --> 02:24:33.800
the psyches of teachers,

02:24:33.800 --> 02:24:37.800
paraprofessionals, admin and so this presentation

02:24:37.800 --> 02:24:41.800
that we just saw right now and

02:24:41.800 --> 02:24:45.800
tapping into the statement that President Darlene Hammond

02:24:45.800 --> 02:24:49.800
made about philosophy,

02:24:49.800 --> 02:24:53.800
I'd like to think of a way that we can

02:24:53.800 --> 02:24:57.800
channel all of this and kind of like

02:24:57.800 --> 02:25:01.800
re-represent it to

02:25:01.800 --> 02:25:05.800
our admin, our sites through county offices that

02:25:05.800 --> 02:25:09.800
this is a complete mind shift. I remember during

02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:13.800
NCLB when school departments were pitted against

02:25:13.800 --> 02:25:17.800
each other, our schools were pitted against each other

02:25:17.800 --> 02:25:21.800
like, look at how well English is doing, oh, look at how math is doing

02:25:21.800 --> 02:25:25.800
and so those scars are still there and

02:25:25.800 --> 02:25:29.800
I would love to communicate the philosophy

02:25:29.800 --> 02:25:33.800
and to show and we're doing it with a lot of the, whether it's

02:25:33.800 --> 02:25:37.800
community schools and so

02:25:37.800 --> 02:25:41.800
many of the steps that this board has taken to improve

02:25:41.800 --> 02:25:45.800
this. I'd also like to echo and thank the callers

02:25:45.800 --> 02:25:49.800
for their comments this morning and I want to

02:25:49.800 --> 02:25:53.800
echo the comments about school climate from our

02:25:53.800 --> 02:25:57.800
caller who just left high school herself,

02:25:57.800 --> 02:26:01.800
how important that is and how important the

02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:05.800
social emotional learning component, having

02:26:05.800 --> 02:26:09.800
students feel connected to the campus,

02:26:09.800 --> 02:26:13.800
to their teachers, to their classmates and

02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:17.800
this I think is also something that

02:26:17.800 --> 02:26:21.800
is directly connected to equity and

02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:25.800
perhaps thinking about what we can do at schools to

02:26:25.800 --> 02:26:29.800
maybe

02:26:29.800 --> 02:26:33.800
rethink what our schools look like so that

02:26:33.800 --> 02:26:37.800
we can have real spaces, authentic spaces for those

02:26:37.800 --> 02:26:41.800
transformations. Also I don't

02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:45.800
want to feel like we don't have the

02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:49.800
proper expectations for our English language

02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:53.800
learners and I really, this topic has come up a few times and I

02:26:53.800 --> 02:26:57.800
want to acknowledge our advocates for English language learners

02:26:57.800 --> 02:27:01.800
because being one myself, being from a board of community

02:27:01.800 --> 02:27:05.800
and understanding the needs of our English language learners

02:27:05.800 --> 02:27:09.800
and how important it is to have a command of the language

02:27:09.800 --> 02:27:13.800
to be able to be college and career ready

02:27:13.800 --> 02:27:17.800
and I'd really like to explore that question that has come up again

02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:21.800
about the cut scores and how our efforts are

02:27:21.800 --> 02:27:25.800
being channeled in that area. And lastly

02:27:25.800 --> 02:27:29.800
and thank you Superintendent Thurman for

02:27:29.800 --> 02:27:33.800
that shout out to teachers teaching summer school. I did it for the first time this

02:27:33.800 --> 02:27:37.800
year and as I was teaching about the creation of

02:27:37.800 --> 02:27:41.800
the atom bomb and the Manhattan project, I was talking about

02:27:41.800 --> 02:27:45.800
the differences in thought between the conflict

02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:49.800
between the army under Lieutenant Groves

02:27:49.800 --> 02:27:53.800
and Oppenheimer and the scientists

02:27:53.800 --> 02:27:57.800
and that clash between the scientific thinking and the

02:27:57.800 --> 02:28:01.800
top down thinking and a student of mine said

02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:05.800
oh I know science has so many opinions, right? And like all my shackles

02:28:05.800 --> 02:28:09.800
went up because no, science doesn't have opinions, right?

02:28:09.800 --> 02:28:13.800
There's a difference between facts and opinions and for a lot of the problems

02:28:13.800 --> 02:28:17.800
that exist in our society from

02:28:17.800 --> 02:28:21.800
climate change to how to create

02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:25.800
safer and healthier communities, science is at the core of that

02:28:25.800 --> 02:28:29.800
and I appreciate the

02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:33.800
amount of money that's been set aside

02:28:33.800 --> 02:28:37.800
for STEM education and I'd also like to explore the possibility

02:28:37.800 --> 02:28:41.800
of having science, the CAST results

02:28:41.800 --> 02:28:45.800
as an information item. Thank you.

02:28:45.800 --> 02:28:49.800
Thank you very much. Member Orozco-Gonzalez

02:28:49.800 --> 02:28:53.800
is next.

02:28:53.800 --> 02:28:57.800
Hello everyone. I wanted to really just thank

02:28:57.800 --> 02:29:01.800
the CDE for the outstanding overview of assessments and cut scores.

02:29:01.800 --> 02:29:05.800
I truly appreciate the information as a practitioner and how it applies to my

02:29:05.800 --> 02:29:09.800
instruction. I work with predominantly English language learners

02:29:09.800 --> 02:29:13.800
and I myself am an English language learner and I know how

02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:17.800
important it is to have accurate data so that we can drive instruction

02:29:17.800 --> 02:29:21.800
and create proper assessments not only to drive

02:29:21.800 --> 02:29:25.800
our instruction but to learn from and I'd like to explore

02:29:25.800 --> 02:29:29.800
and dive deeper into the aggregated scores and the dashboard in regards to

02:29:29.800 --> 02:29:33.800
the results for English language learners. This is I think

02:29:33.800 --> 02:29:37.800
an ongoing conversation so I think that for our future meeting this

02:29:37.800 --> 02:29:41.800
is something I'd like to also revisit the EL definition

02:29:41.800 --> 02:29:45.800
for the academic indicator and the report for ELOs

02:29:45.800 --> 02:29:49.800
and for RFEP separately for accountability.

02:29:49.800 --> 02:29:53.800
This is something that I think is of

02:29:53.800 --> 02:29:57.800
high interest not only to the callers but I think to teachers

02:29:57.800 --> 02:30:01.800
across the state that are working with English language learners and how

02:30:01.800 --> 02:30:05.800
it could drive our instruction.

02:30:05.800 --> 02:30:09.800
Thank you so much. Member Patio Bronson.

02:30:09.800 --> 02:30:13.800
Good. Not quite morning, late

02:30:13.800 --> 02:30:17.800
morning now. I also want to join in thanks

02:30:17.800 --> 02:30:21.800
to the CDE for an incredibly concise

02:30:21.800 --> 02:30:25.800
but also really rich history of the present.

02:30:25.800 --> 02:30:29.800
It's sort of extraordinary and

02:30:29.800 --> 02:30:33.800
really actually it slightly made me nostalgic to hear

02:30:33.800 --> 02:30:37.800
the start off with the getting down to facts reports

02:30:37.800 --> 02:30:41.800
at the beginning and realizing because it's

02:30:41.800 --> 02:30:45.800
so much I think the air that we breathe now in California but also realizing

02:30:45.800 --> 02:30:49.800
that it's not really even a full decade old

02:30:49.800 --> 02:30:53.800
and that it is still not the norm around the country

02:30:53.800 --> 02:30:57.800
to have these types of aims around continuous improvement

02:30:57.800 --> 02:31:01.800
of data as a flashlight but also of

02:31:01.800 --> 02:31:05.800
all of the meat that goes into

02:31:05.800 --> 02:31:09.800
actually shining a light and improving or clarifying

02:31:09.800 --> 02:31:13.800
pathways for improvement. I think there were a couple themes

02:31:13.800 --> 02:31:17.800
that I just wanted to lift up that some of our

02:31:17.800 --> 02:31:21.800
board colleagues just lifted up as well but two that

02:31:21.800 --> 02:31:25.800
stand out I think that came up across several public

02:31:25.800 --> 02:31:29.800
comments

02:31:29.800 --> 02:31:33.800
around a future

02:31:33.800 --> 02:31:37.800
in which we're going to want to look I think a little bit more at

02:31:37.800 --> 02:31:41.800
disaggregating RFEPs and ELs

02:31:41.800 --> 02:31:45.800
and wanting to understand more but also wanting to really look at

02:31:45.800 --> 02:31:49.800
what our current data system does by aggregating

02:31:49.800 --> 02:31:53.800
those groups and also what are the opportunities for improvement

02:31:53.800 --> 02:31:57.800
in the future. I think another issue around the cut scores

02:31:57.800 --> 02:32:01.800
for LPs and what sort of

02:32:01.800 --> 02:32:05.800
expectations we're broadcasting in the future system I think are

02:32:05.800 --> 02:32:09.800
great topics for us to think about in the future and

02:32:09.800 --> 02:32:13.800
as I think particularly anything that the department

02:32:13.800 --> 02:32:17.800
can share in terms of timelines, spaces for engagement

02:32:17.800 --> 02:32:21.800
particularly for members of the Ed community

02:32:21.800 --> 02:32:25.800
I think would be really helpful so that people know

02:32:25.800 --> 02:32:29.800
what the calendar and the rhythm of business will be for

02:32:29.800 --> 02:32:33.800
2023 I think which was named as kind of the time frame when we'd be

02:32:33.800 --> 02:32:37.800
looking at some of these issues in the future. And then maybe just

02:32:37.800 --> 02:32:41.800
the last thing I'll say is all of the evolution I think that

02:32:41.800 --> 02:32:45.800
was described in the presentation

02:32:45.800 --> 02:32:49.800
is really the, is a number

02:32:49.800 --> 02:32:53.800
of tectonic shifts some of which have originated here at State

02:32:53.800 --> 02:32:57.800
Board, some of which have been in the governor's office, the legislature

02:32:57.800 --> 02:33:01.800
the many educators who actually lead our schools

02:33:01.800 --> 02:33:05.800
and I also just want to flag that I think so many of the

02:33:05.800 --> 02:33:09.800
education advocates and equity advocates have

02:33:09.800 --> 02:33:13.800
continued to sort of push our thinking and I want to thank all

02:33:13.800 --> 02:33:17.800
of the many contributors to this conversation

02:33:17.800 --> 02:33:21.800
who are not settling for good enough and I think it's

02:33:21.800 --> 02:33:25.800
a hallmark of California striving

02:33:25.800 --> 02:33:29.800
that we are continuing to seek to improve this system as we move

02:33:29.800 --> 02:33:33.800
forward. Thank you. Member

02:33:33.800 --> 02:33:37.800
Lewis and then member Olken.

02:33:37.800 --> 02:33:41.800
Thank you President Darling-Hammond and I would also like

02:33:41.800 --> 02:33:45.800
to echo my thanks to the staff for the presentation today

02:33:45.800 --> 02:33:49.800
even though I'm not too far from the process of having been involved

02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:53.800
in all of that and looking at data at the school sites and within the district

02:33:53.800 --> 02:33:57.800
it was a great refresher and great reminder of the accountability system and

02:33:57.800 --> 02:34:01.800
also thank you not to just only current staff, the past staff

02:34:01.800 --> 02:34:05.800
current board members, past board members that had a role in helping

02:34:05.800 --> 02:34:09.800
to develop that system and to roll it out so that we can better serve

02:34:09.800 --> 02:34:13.800
our students. But without repeating and going into depth on a

02:34:13.800 --> 02:34:17.800
lot of things that have already been said by my colleagues I would just also

02:34:17.800 --> 02:34:21.800
like to echo my desire for us to look further

02:34:21.800 --> 02:34:25.800
into science information only on the dashboard

02:34:25.800 --> 02:34:29.800
and what would be a reasonable timing for that in light of

02:34:29.800 --> 02:34:33.800
when it actually becomes a indicator, true indicator

02:34:33.800 --> 02:34:37.800
with results on our dashboard. Also

02:34:37.800 --> 02:34:41.800
with revisiting the definition of ELs

02:34:41.800 --> 02:34:45.800
and disaggregating the EL data, what's the feasibility of that

02:34:45.800 --> 02:34:49.800
and what information can be drawn from that that would help our

02:34:49.800 --> 02:34:53.800
school sites better serve our EL population. And the only

02:34:53.800 --> 02:34:57.800
thing I would like to add in addition to that is in reviewing

02:34:57.800 --> 02:35:01.800
the memo,

02:35:01.800 --> 02:35:05.800
the evaluation memo of August 13, 2019 regarding an update

02:35:05.800 --> 02:35:09.800
on the inclusion of English learners in the academic

02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:13.800
indicator and others. I wanted, there was information in there

02:35:13.800 --> 02:35:17.800
about what the

02:35:17.800 --> 02:35:21.800
disaggregation or just reporting

02:35:21.800 --> 02:35:25.800
English learners only and leaving out reclassified

02:35:25.800 --> 02:35:29.800
English learners, what that would do to the

02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:33.800
size of those different groups and how many

02:35:33.800 --> 02:35:37.800
districts would be eliminated from getting scores for those

02:35:37.800 --> 02:35:41.800
students but also in that memo was about

02:35:41.800 --> 02:35:45.800
the fact that

02:35:45.800 --> 02:35:49.800
EL and RFP student populations

02:35:49.800 --> 02:35:53.800
could have different characteristics because our reclassification

02:35:53.800 --> 02:35:57.800
system is so different within districts across the state

02:35:57.800 --> 02:36:01.800
and that I know that the LPAC is one

02:36:01.800 --> 02:36:05.800
common indicator for reclassification across the state

02:36:05.800 --> 02:36:09.800
and then at the time there was the octal that was going to be

02:36:09.800 --> 02:36:13.800
piloted in certain districts and I'd like to hear more

02:36:13.800 --> 02:36:17.800
about that and where we are with that pilot and what

02:36:17.800 --> 02:36:21.800
is the feasibility of creating a system statewide where there's

02:36:21.800 --> 02:36:25.800
more than, there's indicators maybe the same within

02:36:25.800 --> 02:36:29.800
districts whether that, the pros and the cons of that so that

02:36:29.800 --> 02:36:33.800
maybe at the crux of the problem is the, or the concern

02:36:33.800 --> 02:36:37.800
is the reclassification and how that differs so much

02:36:37.800 --> 02:36:41.800
across districts and how you're actually comparing

02:36:41.800 --> 02:36:45.800
apples to apples when that reclassification

02:36:45.800 --> 02:36:49.800
is so different. I'm articulating that clearly but if that's an

02:36:49.800 --> 02:36:53.800
area that we could look into and get more information

02:36:53.800 --> 02:36:57.800
regarding that and I think that

02:36:57.800 --> 02:37:01.800
is on my list

02:37:01.800 --> 02:37:05.800
that hasn't been repeated so thank you. I don't want to be repetitive

02:37:05.800 --> 02:37:09.800
but thank you. I agree with you. It's also helpful to know

02:37:09.800 --> 02:37:13.800
where there's reinforcement for interest in certain areas

02:37:13.800 --> 02:37:17.800
so thank you so much. Member Olkin and then Member

02:37:17.800 --> 02:37:21.800
Glyverwood, should I see your hand go up for a minute? Okay.

02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:25.800
Member Olkin. Thank you. Thank you

02:37:25.800 --> 02:37:29.800
again to reiterate for this incredible presentation.

02:37:29.800 --> 02:37:33.800
Member Lewis just said she's not far removed from

02:37:33.800 --> 02:37:37.800
being at the school level or the district level where you're working with this

02:37:37.800 --> 02:37:41.800
accountability system and data on a regular basis

02:37:41.800 --> 02:37:45.800
and I'm not removed at all and it was still extremely

02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:49.800
helpful to me and so I really appreciate

02:37:49.800 --> 02:37:53.800
both the thoughtfulness of the presentation and also

02:37:53.800 --> 02:37:57.800
the foresight that this would be useful for us

02:37:57.800 --> 02:38:01.800
just thinking about how this will help us do a good job

02:38:01.800 --> 02:38:05.800
moving forward so thank you. And I

02:38:05.800 --> 02:38:09.800
have a couple of thoughts. One, I absolutely wanted to

02:38:09.800 --> 02:38:13.800
reinforce or just agree with Member

02:38:13.800 --> 02:38:17.800
Rodriguez about the sort of scars of old accountability

02:38:17.800 --> 02:38:21.800
systems having worked in education long enough to

02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:25.800
feel like accountability was a really long four-letter

02:38:25.800 --> 02:38:29.800
word. It didn't

02:38:29.800 --> 02:38:33.800
measure the accountability systems. Not only did they not measure

02:38:33.800 --> 02:38:37.800
what we cared about but they went about it in a way that

02:38:37.800 --> 02:38:41.800
felt very reductive and ableist and

02:38:41.800 --> 02:38:45.800
reinforced bad school climate rather than helping

02:38:45.800 --> 02:38:49.800
create a good one and I think

02:38:49.800 --> 02:38:53.800
one of the things that struck me as really important was very early

02:38:53.800 --> 02:38:57.800
in the presentation when we were

02:38:57.800 --> 02:39:01.800
talking about the goals of our accountability system and that the

02:39:01.800 --> 02:39:05.800
goals of the accountability system are as much about student

02:39:05.800 --> 02:39:09.800
performance as increasing capacity of educators

02:39:09.800 --> 02:39:13.800
and schools to do good work and

02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:17.800
I think that in and of itself is a really big shift

02:39:17.800 --> 02:39:21.800
and I think it's a place perhaps to double down

02:39:21.800 --> 02:39:25.800
to really think about how the

02:39:25.800 --> 02:39:29.800
accountability system is living out that goal. How is it realizing that goal?

02:39:29.800 --> 02:39:33.800
How are more educators and

02:39:33.800 --> 02:39:37.800
schools becoming better at

02:39:37.800 --> 02:39:41.800
what they do because of the multiple measures

02:39:41.800 --> 02:39:45.800
in our system? How do they understand them so they feel like they can focus

02:39:45.800 --> 02:39:49.800
on them in a good way? How are we using the

02:39:49.800 --> 02:39:53.800
communication tools that we've already created?

02:39:53.800 --> 02:39:57.800
All of that stuff feels very important to me because without

02:39:57.800 --> 02:40:01.800
really focusing on the capacity of

02:40:01.800 --> 02:40:05.800
people, teachers, school leaders,

02:40:05.800 --> 02:40:09.800
paraprofessionals, special educators, parents,

02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:13.800
kids even, to understand

02:40:13.800 --> 02:40:17.800
what it is we're

02:40:17.800 --> 02:40:21.800
striving for and what the supports are that are out there.

02:40:21.800 --> 02:40:25.800
The accountability system will I think continue to feel like a very long

02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:29.800
four letter word to people even though it isn't anymore.

02:40:29.800 --> 02:40:33.800
And then that sort of brings me to another related

02:40:33.800 --> 02:40:37.800
piece about capacity

02:40:37.800 --> 02:40:41.800
of educators and

02:40:41.800 --> 02:40:45.800
the link between student achievement and teacher

02:40:45.800 --> 02:40:49.800
efficacy which is there isn't

02:40:49.800 --> 02:40:53.800
and I could be wrong although I did just listen very carefully, anything

02:40:53.800 --> 02:40:57.800
in the accountability system related to

02:40:57.800 --> 02:41:01.800
staff climate, staff growth,

02:41:01.800 --> 02:41:05.800
anything that is

02:41:05.800 --> 02:41:09.800
recognizing and prioritizing

02:41:09.800 --> 02:41:13.800
that link between

02:41:13.800 --> 02:41:17.800
teacher growth, adult learning, and student learning.

02:41:17.800 --> 02:41:21.800
I know for example in terms of

02:41:21.800 --> 02:41:25.800
developing a strong school

02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:29.800
climate, the climate amongst our staff,

02:41:29.800 --> 02:41:33.800
first you need to think about how you're developing a strong

02:41:33.800 --> 02:41:37.800
for example race, equity, culture amongst your adults so that the

02:41:37.800 --> 02:41:41.800
adults then can do the same for, can help guide that for the

02:41:41.800 --> 02:41:45.800
students. And so there's something in there for me around staff

02:41:45.800 --> 02:41:49.800
culture and staff learning that feels really important

02:41:49.800 --> 02:41:53.800
if we're trying to measure what we value.

02:41:53.800 --> 02:41:57.800
So those are my thoughts. I hope they make sense. Thank you.

02:41:57.800 --> 02:42:01.800
Vice President Clever-Woods.

02:42:01.800 --> 02:42:05.800
Thank you. I first of all thank and appreciate

02:42:05.800 --> 02:42:09.800
all the public comments we received as well as correspondence and

02:42:09.800 --> 02:42:13.800
all of the great comments that we just heard from all of

02:42:13.800 --> 02:42:17.800
the board members. My request

02:42:17.800 --> 02:42:21.800
is as we go forward that we have opportunity

02:42:21.800 --> 02:42:25.800
to also know what has been done

02:42:25.800 --> 02:42:29.800
up to this point in some of these areas.

02:42:29.800 --> 02:42:33.800
Reason being, not that it doesn't mean that things should not be

02:42:33.800 --> 02:42:37.800
changed or adjusted, but it's very helpful, at least I know for me,

02:42:37.800 --> 02:42:41.800
it's very helpful to know what has been talked about, what

02:42:41.800 --> 02:42:45.800
has been looked at even prior to

02:42:45.800 --> 02:42:49.800
all of us coming on the board so that as we move forward

02:42:49.800 --> 02:42:53.800
with that lens of continuous improvement, we have opportunity

02:42:53.800 --> 02:42:57.800
to know what's come before us so that we can look at

02:42:57.800 --> 02:43:01.800
what needs to go ahead. As it was said, really

02:43:01.800 --> 02:43:05.800
it's hard to believe it's only been five years that we've been in the system, but a lot

02:43:05.800 --> 02:43:09.800
has happened in five years, truth be told. So

02:43:09.800 --> 02:43:13.800
there is no doubt that again under that lens of continuous

02:43:13.800 --> 02:43:17.800
improvement that there will need to be things looked at maybe even again

02:43:17.800 --> 02:43:21.800
two or three times to make sure that we get it right for kids.

02:43:21.800 --> 02:43:25.800
So that's my very long way of requesting that as we move forward in our study

02:43:25.800 --> 02:43:29.800
session and future items that we have some background

02:43:29.800 --> 02:43:33.800
on, perhaps what may have been explored prior to that time

02:43:33.800 --> 02:43:37.800
to help us make informed decisions. Thank you.

02:43:37.800 --> 02:43:41.800
Thank you. I think that's everyone who wanted to make a comment

02:43:41.800 --> 02:43:45.800
at this time, so I'm just going to tie up what I've heard

02:43:45.800 --> 02:43:49.800
here and we'll go ahead and

02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:53.800
set the agenda for coming meetings around some of the things that are

02:43:53.800 --> 02:43:57.800
of interest to the board. I heard the

02:43:57.800 --> 02:44:01.800
importance of looking at issues of

02:44:01.800 --> 02:44:05.800
school climate in some broader ways, including staff climate.

02:44:05.800 --> 02:44:09.800
There are states that do actually measure school

02:44:09.800 --> 02:44:13.800
climate in a statewide fashion that also include

02:44:13.800 --> 02:44:17.800
surveys and indicators around teachers and educators and

02:44:17.800 --> 02:44:21.800
other staff. So there's an interesting area to

02:44:21.800 --> 02:44:25.800
explore. We need to know more about what's going on in our own

02:44:25.800 --> 02:44:29.800
state. To your point, Vice President Glover-Woods,

02:44:29.800 --> 02:44:33.800
we need to understand what came before in various areas.

02:44:33.800 --> 02:44:37.800
And also it will be helpful to know what some other states are doing. We are

02:44:37.800 --> 02:44:41.800
ahead of many states in many ways, but there are some states that are doing very innovative

02:44:41.800 --> 02:44:45.800
things that are moving

02:44:45.800 --> 02:44:49.800
beyond where we have yet considered.

02:44:49.800 --> 02:44:53.800
The question about science and how it

02:44:53.800 --> 02:44:57.800
might find its way into the information system

02:44:57.800 --> 02:45:01.800
on the dashboard is one that came up from a number

02:45:01.800 --> 02:45:05.800
of people. The number of

02:45:05.800 --> 02:45:09.800
folks who mentioned the English Learner

02:45:09.800 --> 02:45:13.800
Indicator, I'll just add a little bit of history thinking about what came before,

02:45:13.800 --> 02:45:17.800
remind folks that the

02:45:17.800 --> 02:45:21.800
indicator in the past under No Child Left Behind did keep

02:45:21.800 --> 02:45:25.800
English learners as a separate group from any other reclassified English

02:45:25.800 --> 02:45:29.800
learners. In the current system in ESSA, they did allow for

02:45:29.800 --> 02:45:33.800
students who'd been English learners to be counted in that group for a few more

02:45:33.800 --> 02:45:37.800
years, but then they move out of the group. And the reason that that was

02:45:37.800 --> 02:45:41.800
many, many people advocated for that in the ESSA

02:45:41.800 --> 02:45:45.800
law was because if you only look at

02:45:45.800 --> 02:45:49.800
English learners within the group, you will never see progress because as soon as

02:45:49.800 --> 02:45:53.800
students are reclassified, they leave the group.

02:45:53.800 --> 02:45:57.800
And therefore, when you look at is the group moving, the group can't move because

02:45:57.800 --> 02:46:01.800
of the rules of taking, not counting

02:46:01.800 --> 02:46:05.800
the scores of kids who have progressed beyond the

02:46:05.800 --> 02:46:09.800
benchmark, whatever it is. So it's a complicated question. There's certainly

02:46:09.800 --> 02:46:13.800
a good reason to try to understand how kids are doing at

02:46:13.800 --> 02:46:17.800
different points along the trajectory of English learners.

02:46:17.800 --> 02:46:21.800
And I think there's a lot of interest in exploring all of those questions.

02:46:21.800 --> 02:46:25.800
It is complicated, and member Lewis, I appreciated the fact that you'd

02:46:25.800 --> 02:46:29.800
already been looking into the memo from 2019 and some of the

02:46:29.800 --> 02:46:33.800
various issues that are associated with the indicators. So we'll

02:46:33.800 --> 02:46:37.800
find this about many indicators that there are

02:46:37.800 --> 02:46:41.800
lots of technical and

02:46:41.800 --> 02:46:45.800
normative and other complexities

02:46:45.800 --> 02:46:49.800
to think through. And we clearly want to

02:46:49.800 --> 02:46:53.800
put that on the agenda. And then finally, I really

02:46:53.800 --> 02:46:57.800
appreciated the point. I think it was member Olken who said

02:46:57.800 --> 02:47:01.800
how do we double down on the question of the use of the

02:47:01.800 --> 02:47:05.800
indicators, the dashboard, the accountability system such that

02:47:05.800 --> 02:47:09.800
it can be understood and enabled to

02:47:09.800 --> 02:47:13.800
function as a continuous improvement system so that we can indeed

02:47:13.800 --> 02:47:17.800
really move beyond the old test and punish

02:47:17.800 --> 02:47:21.800
framework that still creates

02:47:21.800 --> 02:47:25.800
PTSD in a lot of educators

02:47:25.800 --> 02:47:29.800
and districts across the state that

02:47:29.800 --> 02:47:33.800
acknowledging the ways in which several people said the schools

02:47:33.800 --> 02:47:37.800
contribute to student growth. That is the main point

02:47:37.800 --> 02:47:41.800
of giving people information and looking at for us

02:47:41.800 --> 02:47:45.800
at the state board level and for other state policy makers to figure out

02:47:45.800 --> 02:47:49.800
how the information we get helps us make the investments that

02:47:49.800 --> 02:47:53.800
can help people in the field

02:47:53.800 --> 02:47:57.800
make progress. So I think that question

02:47:57.800 --> 02:48:01.800
about the use of the indicators and the framing and the philosophy

02:48:01.800 --> 02:48:05.800
and the way in which it's implemented are all important.

02:48:05.800 --> 02:48:09.800
And something also exploring. With that, I think

02:48:09.800 --> 02:48:13.800
we've identified a number of very meaty

02:48:13.800 --> 02:48:17.800
topics. This is a long-term process.

02:48:17.800 --> 02:48:21.800
I really appreciated all the work that Cindy Kazanis has done over the

02:48:21.800 --> 02:48:25.800
years to help us construct the system and her reminder

02:48:25.800 --> 02:48:29.800
of the processes that have gone on. So we're beginning

02:48:29.800 --> 02:48:33.800
the conversation now and we will resume it in the months to

02:48:33.800 --> 02:48:37.800
come. And with that, I think we have earned a break. It's

02:48:37.800 --> 02:48:41.800
11.20. Why don't we come back at 11.35?

02:48:41.800 --> 02:48:45.800
And you may turn off your video

02:48:45.800 --> 02:48:49.800
and your mic, but I encourage you not to leave the meeting.

02:48:49.800 --> 02:48:53.800
All right.

02:48:53.800 --> 02:48:57.800
Welcome back. Board members, we need to reestablish

02:48:57.800 --> 02:49:01.800
the quorum, so Brooks will call the roll.

02:49:01.800 --> 02:49:05.800
Member Bonanca? Here.

02:49:05.800 --> 02:49:09.800
President Darling-Hammond? Here. Member Escobedo?

02:49:09.800 --> 02:49:13.800
Here. Vice President?

02:49:13.800 --> 02:49:17.800
Here. Vice President?

02:49:17.800 --> 02:49:21.800
Here. Vice President Glover-Woods?

02:49:25.800 --> 02:49:29.800
Vice President Glover-Woods?

02:49:29.800 --> 02:49:33.800
I see Vice President Glover-Woods and I see her trying to say something.

02:49:33.800 --> 02:49:37.800
I see her saying, yeah.

02:49:37.800 --> 02:49:41.800
Are we hearing her now? No.

02:49:41.800 --> 02:49:45.800
Okay, Vice President Glover-Woods, I will come back to you. Member Lewis?

02:49:45.800 --> 02:49:49.800
Here. Member McQuillan?

02:49:49.800 --> 02:49:53.800
Here. Member Olken? Here.

02:49:53.800 --> 02:49:57.800
Member Orozco-Gonzalez? Here.

02:49:57.800 --> 02:50:01.800
Member Petillo-Bronson? Here. Member

02:50:01.800 --> 02:50:05.800
Rodriguez? Here. Vice President Glover-Woods?

02:50:05.800 --> 02:50:09.800
Here. Victory. We have a full

02:50:09.800 --> 02:50:13.800
quorum. Everyone's in attendance. Thank you.

02:50:13.800 --> 02:50:17.800
Very good. Item three is the school accountability report

02:50:17.800 --> 02:50:21.800
card approval of the template for the 2021-22

02:50:21.800 --> 02:50:25.800
school accountability report card. The CDE recommends

02:50:25.800 --> 02:50:29.800
that the state board approve the SARC template for the 2021-22

02:50:29.800 --> 02:50:33.800
school year and the item will be presented by Cindy Kazanis of the CDE.

02:50:33.800 --> 02:50:37.800
Cindy, please begin. Thank you, President Darling-Hammond.

02:50:37.800 --> 02:50:41.800
I am back for item three and again, Cindy Kazanis

02:50:41.800 --> 02:50:45.800
with the analysis, measurement, and accountability reporting division.

02:50:45.800 --> 02:50:49.800
You already mentioned the recommendation. The board

02:50:49.800 --> 02:50:53.800
is being asked to approve the annual template for the

02:50:53.800 --> 02:50:57.800
school accountability report card, also known as

02:50:57.800 --> 02:51:01.800
the SARC, for the school year that just ended.

02:51:01.800 --> 02:51:05.800
Just a brief

02:51:05.800 --> 02:51:09.800
background, I will provide a brief background rather on the SARC,

02:51:09.800 --> 02:51:13.800
why we do it, why you have the role of approving a template,

02:51:13.800 --> 02:51:17.800
and then I will briefly go into the updates

02:51:17.800 --> 02:51:21.800
to the tables. This is a much, much, much shorter presentation than what we just

02:51:21.800 --> 02:51:25.800
finished, so we should get through this very quickly.

02:51:25.800 --> 02:51:29.800
This is actually one of the tenets of accountability. When we think about

02:51:29.800 --> 02:51:33.800
accountability in the state of California, this is over

02:51:33.800 --> 02:51:37.800
30 years old, passed in 1988 under

02:51:37.800 --> 02:51:41.800
Proposition 98. The SARC has been around

02:51:41.800 --> 02:51:45.800
for a long time, and there are various

02:51:45.800 --> 02:51:49.800
requirements. In fact, I have my staff maintain an entire webpage around the legislation

02:51:49.800 --> 02:51:53.800
that impacts SARC, but the one that we

02:51:53.800 --> 02:51:57.800
most often mention is the sections that are noted here

02:51:57.800 --> 02:52:01.800
under background. The SARC is also considered the

02:52:01.800 --> 02:52:05.800
accountability report card under the Every Student Succeeds Act. I know we've talked a lot

02:52:05.800 --> 02:52:09.800
about federal legislation and accountability, but the accountability

02:52:09.800 --> 02:52:13.800
system in the U.S. Department of Education's eyes is not the dashboard.

02:52:13.800 --> 02:52:17.800
The dashboard data is used on the SARC, but the dashboard itself

02:52:17.800 --> 02:52:21.800
is not considered our accountability report card. Just also

02:52:21.800 --> 02:52:25.800
a quick reference, the department also produces a comparable

02:52:25.800 --> 02:52:29.800
requirement for LEAs.

02:52:29.800 --> 02:52:33.800
We call that the LARC, and for the state, which is called the STARC,

02:52:33.800 --> 02:52:37.800
those templates do not require state Board of Education approval,

02:52:37.800 --> 02:52:41.800
but they do reside on the same pages that you would find the SARC

02:52:41.800 --> 02:52:45.800
template. So just a brief

02:52:45.800 --> 02:52:49.800
piece, because we've talked about LCFF a lot today, we thought it was

02:52:49.800 --> 02:52:53.800
important to say that there were efforts following

02:52:53.800 --> 02:52:57.800
almost 10 years ago, the passage of LCFF, to align

02:52:57.800 --> 02:53:01.800
the metrics of the SARC and the LCFF.

02:53:01.800 --> 02:53:05.800
So we have, over the past several years,

02:53:05.800 --> 02:53:09.800
tried to align templates and organize sections. You'll also see

02:53:09.800 --> 02:53:13.800
the student group information has become more robust to do this.

02:53:13.800 --> 02:53:17.800
I also note that this is important, because when we see

02:53:17.800 --> 02:53:21.800
reports from other states, there's in fact a data quality campaign does

02:53:21.800 --> 02:53:25.800
show me the data, or I can't remember the exact title, but they have an ANNA report

02:53:25.800 --> 02:53:29.800
where they look at state report card. We get credit for being

02:53:29.800 --> 02:53:33.800
so thorough in the data that we're reporting on the SARC.

02:53:33.800 --> 02:53:37.800
The reorganizations that we've done have tried to make the template

02:53:37.800 --> 02:53:41.800
as user-friendly as possible. Keep in mind, it is not the dashboard, it does not

02:53:41.800 --> 02:53:45.800
have the premise of trying to be

02:53:45.800 --> 02:53:49.800
very user-friendly. So the investment that the state has made on

02:53:49.800 --> 02:53:53.800
getting data out in an easy-to-read format has been on the dashboard.

02:53:53.800 --> 02:53:57.800
But the SARC template has gotten better, and we have invested money in it, and I'm going to talk

02:53:57.800 --> 02:54:01.800
about that in another slide or two. I would also

02:54:01.800 --> 02:54:05.800
just mention, and I really appreciated that the California PTA

02:54:05.800 --> 02:54:09.800
called this out, that there is still interest, it seems like, to align

02:54:09.800 --> 02:54:13.800
the SARC with the LCAP, and that has been done in

02:54:13.800 --> 02:54:17.800
previous legislative sessions and has not been that successful. There is

02:54:17.800 --> 02:54:21.800
a higher vote threshold to get this approved, because it's under Prop 98.

02:54:21.800 --> 02:54:25.800
So as far as the technical redesign,

02:54:25.800 --> 02:54:29.800
this last year we did implement the full

02:54:29.800 --> 02:54:33.800
pieces of what was actually put forward by the

02:54:33.800 --> 02:54:37.800
legislature and funded by the legislature to put together a web application

02:54:37.800 --> 02:54:41.800
and to find a SARC web design. So

02:54:41.800 --> 02:54:45.800
I think we really wanted to point out that you can find the SARC now

02:54:45.800 --> 02:54:49.800
translated into multiple languages, including, of course, our

02:54:49.800 --> 02:54:53.800
most frequently spoken languages, but it is available now in multiple languages.

02:54:53.800 --> 02:54:57.800
And the SARC web application is available to all

02:54:57.800 --> 02:55:01.800
schools, although we still see a very low

02:55:01.800 --> 02:55:05.800
use of it by schools. Less than 20% of schools are using that

02:55:05.800 --> 02:55:09.800
application. Instead, they're continuing their prior practice of

02:55:09.800 --> 02:55:13.800
contracting with vendors or doing that functionality themselves,

02:55:13.800 --> 02:55:17.800
and then just sending us a link to their SARC, which, of course, is required

02:55:17.800 --> 02:55:21.800
under state law that they provide the department a link to their completed

02:55:21.800 --> 02:55:25.800
SARCs. So what's new?

02:55:25.800 --> 02:55:29.800
Well, specifically, we now are going to have two years of teacher

02:55:29.800 --> 02:55:33.800
preparation data, which is very exciting, but in order to

02:55:33.800 --> 02:55:37.800
create room, we had to give another table for that second year of data.

02:55:37.800 --> 02:55:41.800
So you'll see table six in the prior

02:55:41.800 --> 02:55:45.800
year was just the one year of data for teacher preparation and placement.

02:55:45.800 --> 02:55:49.800
We've now duplicated that table to add a second year of data.

02:55:49.800 --> 02:55:53.800
You will see side-by-side years for tables seven, eight, and

02:55:53.800 --> 02:55:57.800
nine. And this information, just to point out if folks are

02:55:57.800 --> 02:56:01.800
looking for where to find the teacher preparation table data

02:56:01.800 --> 02:56:05.800
that was just released two weeks ago, for the SARC, we do have downloadable

02:56:05.800 --> 02:56:09.800
files for every single component the state provides, which is over

02:56:09.800 --> 02:56:13.800
80% of the SARC data, and that is, again, available on our SARC web page.

02:56:13.800 --> 02:56:17.800
We also, of course, last year we had a long

02:56:17.800 --> 02:56:21.800
conversation, and you spent a lot of time because of

02:56:21.800 --> 02:56:25.800
COVID and the allowance to districts when they weren't able

02:56:25.800 --> 02:56:29.800
to test with the state assessments, there was an option to do the local assessments.

02:56:29.800 --> 02:56:33.800
Those tables are no longer needed, since that was a one year

02:56:33.800 --> 02:56:37.800
reporting out of that data, and so those tables have been removed from this

02:56:37.800 --> 02:56:41.800
year's template. And then finally, around the physical fitness test,

02:56:41.800 --> 02:56:45.800
there has been some changes in results of the

02:56:45.800 --> 02:56:49.800
administration has changed, and so you will see those results

02:56:49.800 --> 02:56:53.800
no longer as the percentage of students meeting the fitness standards, but

02:56:53.800 --> 02:56:57.800
rather the percentage of students participating in each of the

02:56:57.800 --> 02:57:01.800
fitness gram components, the five components.

02:57:01.800 --> 02:57:05.800
And so, again, going back to the item recommendation, we recommend the State

02:57:05.800 --> 02:57:09.800
Board of Education approve the SARC template for the 2021-2022

02:57:09.800 --> 02:57:13.800
school year.

02:57:15.800 --> 02:57:19.800
.

02:57:19.800 --> 02:57:23.800
.

02:57:23.800 --> 02:57:27.800
.

02:57:27.800 --> 02:57:31.800
.

02:57:31.800 --> 02:57:35.800
.

02:57:35.800 --> 02:57:39.800
.

02:57:39.800 --> 02:57:43.800
.

02:57:43.800 --> 02:57:47.800
.

02:57:47.800 --> 02:57:51.800
.

02:57:51.800 --> 02:57:55.800
.
