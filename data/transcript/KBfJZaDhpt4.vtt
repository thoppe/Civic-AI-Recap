00:00.229 --> 00:01.010
On to item three.

00:01.030 --> 00:06.375
Is it appropriate this time to ask Kathy a question?

00:09.118 --> 00:09.638
Can I ask?

00:11.160 --> 00:13.242
Related to what she said.

00:14.774 --> 00:32.287
So regarding the recommended text that you just mentioned, so we are saying that with this packet, we are not really looking at or approving these text lists, there's a list that's included.

00:33.247 --> 00:38.131
On page 31, for example, Mr. Popham's Penguin, I mean, we're not, is that what you're talking about?

00:38.979 --> 00:43.823
Well, the appendices, I think, were not forwarded by the Commission.

00:44.243 --> 00:59.915
No, I was referring to some preparatory materials that were part of the released document from the National Common Core writers, but our concern in speaking with our attorneys is that because

01:00.615 --> 01:14.640
that preparatory material is not standards, and we're not certain what legal impact they would have if you accepted those as part of the standards, we're requesting that you accept only the standards themselves.

01:15.980 --> 01:17.641
Does that help?

01:17.861 --> 01:26.344
Somewhat, because what I'm referring to on text illustrating the complexity, it is part of the package, it's not appendix.

01:27.190 --> 01:36.697
and you have a list for schools, for K-5, and you have a list for 6-12 on the books we're supposed to have.

01:36.757 --> 01:37.757
So are we adopting that?

01:37.797 --> 01:39.338
No?

01:39.479 --> 01:50.586
Let me take a try at that in just a second, because I don't... This is an important question, but I don't want us to go down that hole this way.

01:52.628 --> 01:53.068
Thanks, Kathy.

01:55.287 --> 01:58.170
So let's take up item three.

01:58.850 --> 02:06.477
Deb Sigmund is going to introduce the item, and then we will hear from the commission and commissioners.

02:07.077 --> 02:16.145
After that, board members, I think it would be appropriate for us to ask questions of the commissioners before we go into public comment.

02:16.165 --> 02:22.451
I know there are members of the public who would like to give us their guidance, and we'll appreciate that.

02:23.255 --> 02:34.000
But I do think, Yvonne, that clarifying what it is that we're being asked to do today and what it is that we are not being asked to do today is absolutely essential.

02:34.060 --> 02:39.503
And I want to reserve the right to kind of break in at the appropriate moment to try

02:40.259 --> 02:42.500
to separate those two things.

02:42.560 --> 02:58.829
But as we do go into this item, I want to echo something that I know the superintendent believes, and it was in the recommendation, and Kathy Gaither also mentioned it, that this is a historic moment, but it is not something new for us.

02:59.070 --> 03:08.615
That California led the way in the development of standards-based reform, and this is an opportunity today, thanks to the good work of the Academic Content Standards Commission,

03:09.375 --> 03:22.182
for us to once again lead the nation in developing, promulgating, and building curricula and assessments around the highest quality standards in the land.

03:22.923 --> 03:38.051
And if we were to go ahead with this, as I hope we do, we will indeed be leaders in the coalition of the most advanced states in guiding the nation toward a coherent set of standards.

03:38.618 --> 03:40.639
So, Deb, all yours.

03:41.359 --> 03:48.543
Thank you, President Mitchell, and good morning to you and Superintendent O'Connell and board members and Executive Director Schweitzer.

03:49.063 --> 03:50.323
Welcome.

03:50.764 --> 04:04.130
I'm here to open and introduce the item for consideration of the California Academic Content Standards Commission's recommendations to adopt the Common Core Standards, including California-specific standards.

04:04.990 --> 04:12.416
And in particular, I want to provide to you Superintendent O'Connell's recommendation with regard to the Common Core.

04:13.336 --> 04:19.241
Undersecretary Gaither gave a beautiful background in terms of how we are here today.

04:19.801 --> 04:30.709
So I will cut that a bit short, but only to say that, as she mentioned, the superintendent, President Mitchell, and the governor sent forth a letter

04:32.050 --> 04:38.914
in the fall, pardon me, in May of 2009, wanting to be part of the Common Core effort.

04:39.014 --> 04:52.862
And the superintendent at that point, as did the other authors of the letter, wanted to make sure that the standards would not be watered down, that we would maintain our rigorous set of standards.

04:53.383 --> 04:56.925
That was obviously incredibly important to the superintendent.

04:58.929 --> 05:22.625
And then, of course, SBX 51 authorized the California Academic Content Standards Commission, which met during the months of June and July, three meetings, six days, and as Undersecretary Gaither mentioned, long hours and very hard work to get to the point where we are today.

05:23.986 --> 05:33.312
and sent forth a document including the standards, but additional text to which I think Secretary Gaither was referring.

05:34.333 --> 05:48.743
So the superintendent recommends that this board adopt the Common Core standards, the recommended additional standards, and the recommendations as acted upon by the Commission.

05:50.270 --> 06:02.278
He also recommends that you direct the California Department of Education to submit an implementation plan and a timeline for the implementation of the standards.

06:03.559 --> 06:07.062
That is consistent with the Elementary, Secondary, and Education Act.

06:07.762 --> 06:11.304
And that be brought forward to you in a future meeting.

06:12.325 --> 06:14.347
That is the superintendent's recommendation.

06:15.207 --> 06:20.311
I'm happy to take questions, and if there are none, I'm going to introduce the next speaker.

06:24.475 --> 06:25.075
Let's keep going.

06:25.235 --> 06:25.635
Alrighty.

06:26.116 --> 06:34.382
It's my pleasure to introduce Sue Stickle, the Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and Interventions at the Sacramento County Office of Education.

06:34.803 --> 06:37.885
Sue also served as the Project Director of the Commission.

06:38.886 --> 06:39.066
Sue?

06:44.059 --> 06:44.860
Well, good morning.

06:45.380 --> 06:51.886
Good morning, President Mitchell, Superintendent O'Connell, board members, and congratulations, Executive Director Schweitzer.

06:53.047 --> 06:59.732
My name is Sue Stickel, and my day job is to work at the Sacramento County Office of Education.

07:00.293 --> 07:07.098
My 24-7 job for the past six weeks has been to serve as the Project Director for the Academic Standards Commission.

07:08.079 --> 07:12.003
And as most things, I am grateful for the opportunity.

07:14.175 --> 07:26.203
It's my task this morning to provide you with just a brief amount of background about the Common Core Standards, give you a little history, give you a little bit of background to help base your decision.

07:27.404 --> 07:31.127
A little over a year ago, the words Common Core Standards really were not

07:31.923 --> 07:38.786
I was thinking about it last night, we didn't even utter those words, but now they've become part of our everyday work and everyday vocabulary.

07:39.807 --> 07:47.990
The Council of Chief State School Officers and the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices began work on the Common Core Standards last summer.

07:49.291 --> 07:55.934
The focus of the standards was ensuring that our students are college and career ready when they graduate from high school.

07:57.014 --> 08:07.938
With this in mind, these organizations, along with experts throughout the country, developed the College and Career Ready Standards for English Language Arts and Mathematics, and they were completed last fall, 2009.

08:11.240 --> 08:24.725
As the experts continued to work on the K-12 content standards that were ultimately released on June 2nd, they used this College and Career Ready work as a beacon, and they embedded these standards in their future work.

08:25.886 --> 08:34.491
In doing this work, the development team could have easily taken all of the state standards, the 50 states, and identified what they had in common and called it good.

08:35.831 --> 08:37.652
But we all know that's not a really good choice.

08:38.253 --> 08:45.797
And so they have done a great deal of thoughtful work with a lot of feedback over the past year.

08:46.816 --> 09:05.055
The overarching goals of these standards are to ensure that our students are meeting college and work expectations, that they're prepared to succeed in our global economy and society, and that they're provided with rigorous content and applications of knowledge through higher order thinking skills.

09:06.289 --> 09:11.493
The standards build upon the strengths and the lessons of current state standards.

09:12.254 --> 09:23.063
And it is quite evident the California standards had a huge role in this area and that the standards that you see before you today have been well informed by research.

09:24.264 --> 09:29.449
In developing the standards, four groups of experts were involved, an advisory group,

09:30.362 --> 09:41.987
A standards development work group that included experts that were involved in developing California standards, Dr. Wu, Professor Emeritus from Berkeley, and Dr. Louisa Mose.

09:42.868 --> 09:49.831
An expert feedback group and a validation committee that ensured that the standards met the development criteria.

09:50.651 --> 09:53.413
Five California experts were members of this group.

09:54.433 --> 09:57.055
On June 2nd, the final product was released.

09:57.535 --> 10:00.877
To date, nearly 30 states have adopted the standards.

10:01.477 --> 10:05.139
So let's just briefly talk about English language arts and mathematics now.

10:05.839 --> 10:10.022
It's important to note that three parts of California standards were used.

10:10.802 --> 10:11.763
Reading foundations,

10:12.563 --> 10:18.768
the grade-by-grade standards, and the focus from our 2008 framework on vocabulary and writing.

10:20.309 --> 10:24.351
Ways that the Common Core have improved on our current standards are as follows.

10:24.952 --> 10:30.776
A greater balance between literature and the analysis of informational text.

10:30.796 --> 10:34.979
And systematic, almost stair-step development of reading comprehension.

10:35.900 --> 10:37.601
A focus on text complexity.

10:39.742 --> 10:52.005
which is the heart of failures of many of our students as for college readiness, reading and writing across the curriculum, and a focus on writing arguments and drawing evidence from sources.

10:53.105 --> 10:58.447
In the area of mathematics, they also use California standards in their development.

10:59.447 --> 11:04.411
The College and Career Standards in Mathematics served as guideposts for the Common Core.

11:04.712 --> 11:15.661
They were built with focus on preparing students also for success in Algebra I. The Math Common Core are a balanced combination of procedure and understanding.

11:16.522 --> 11:27.331
The design of the standards feature the hierarchical nature of content with clarity and specificity and they focus on conceptual understanding of key ideas.

11:28.797 --> 11:31.419
They travel by grade level in grades K through 8.

11:32.019 --> 11:39.865
And then there's sets of standards grouped in conceptual clusters in high school, such as algebra, functions, geometry.

11:41.166 --> 11:46.350
But the common core in mathematics also feature the standards of mathematical practice.

11:48.030 --> 11:59.395
This is expertise that standards seek to develop in their students, things like reasoning abstractly and quantitatively and making sense of problems and persevering in solving them.

12:00.928 --> 12:05.990
In conclusion, the Common Core Standards that were released on June 2nd are rigorous.

12:06.891 --> 12:16.756
They form a coherent set of standards and they prepare students for college and career and are sensitive to the needs of English learners and the students with disabilities.

12:17.536 --> 12:19.157
And so now it is my great pleasure

12:19.897 --> 12:25.001
to introduce Greg Geeting, who served as the chair of the Standards Commission.

12:25.942 --> 12:32.387
He did incredible work, and in three short meetings, they seemed incredibly long, but they were short.

12:33.088 --> 12:33.868
The time was short.

12:34.789 --> 12:41.414
He did yeoman's work, and he's here to talk to you about what we're bringing forward to you today.

12:44.456 --> 12:46.418
Thank you, Sue, for an extraordinary job.

12:48.667 --> 12:50.188
Indeed, thank you very much, Sue.

12:52.089 --> 13:09.876
President Mitchell, Superintendent O'Connell, board members, Executive Director Schweitzer, and distinguished guests, thank you for allowing me to participate in this review of the Academic Standards Commission's recommendation of new English language arts and mathematics content standards.

13:10.477 --> 13:15.299
The recommendation is based, as Sue told you, on the National Common Core Standards released June 2nd.

13:16.593 --> 13:20.756
by the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers.

13:22.677 --> 13:36.685
This morning, my intent is to provide you some background information on the Commission and its work, and then to highlight some key additions to the Common Core that the Commission included in its recommendation.

13:37.165 --> 13:42.709
For the most part, the Commission proposed additions reflect material that actually appears in

13:43.622 --> 13:49.123
or was inspired by the current California ELA and mathematics standards.

13:50.023 --> 13:57.385
At the outset, I must praise the individuals who served on the commission and their appointing authorities.

13:58.105 --> 14:11.168
These individuals brought a wealth of diverse backgrounds and experiences to the commission's charge, and they went about their work with diligence, with intelligence, and with passion.

14:12.213 --> 14:17.758
There were times that the passion became a challenge, given the pressure of the ticking clock.

14:18.659 --> 14:22.362
But in retrospect, I'm glad that passion ran high.

14:23.303 --> 14:33.932
The journey we shared, even through objections and amendments and points of order and motions to postpone, fundamentally visited places of principle.

14:35.220 --> 14:39.584
and belief about what students should learn and be able to do.

14:40.164 --> 14:44.848
And visiting such places as those is not time wasted.

14:45.929 --> 14:52.094
These commissioners are men and women of substance who did their very best for the students of our state.

14:53.255 --> 15:03.384
I must also take a minute to praise the outstanding staff who supported the commission under the able leadership of Project Director Sue Stickle.

15:04.338 --> 15:09.980
When we initially thought about this effort, we envisioned perhaps five or six staff.

15:10.741 --> 15:18.244
Well, last week I prepared thank you letters to 21 individuals who contributed to the staffing effort.

15:20.225 --> 15:31.209
I literally ran out of superlatives to describe their work over our month of togetherness, but suffice it to say that they were magnificent.

15:32.270 --> 15:33.010
And as for Sue,

15:34.324 --> 15:43.267
As Superintendent O'Connell well knows, her talents and abilities long ago transitioned from mere stories to mythical proportions.

15:44.428 --> 15:49.049
And with this effort, she truly transcends into the stuff of legend.

15:50.030 --> 15:51.210
We cannot thank her enough.

15:51.910 --> 15:53.371
Now, some of the details.

15:54.451 --> 16:02.494
There were 21 commissioners appointed for the most part in early June, about the same time the National Common Core was released in its final form.

16:03.365 --> 16:10.748
We met for six days, two in mid-June, two in early July, and then we wrapped it up on July 14th and 15th.

16:11.949 --> 16:16.190
We provided many opportunities for the public to access our meetings.

16:16.651 --> 16:20.592
Our in-person audience generally ranged from 20 to 40 each day.

16:22.033 --> 16:31.797
And between 200 and 300 unique individuals viewed our proceedings via online streaming almost every meeting day.

16:32.734 --> 16:34.775
and we entertain public input frequently.

16:36.395 --> 16:47.058
We learned about the National Common Core from David Coleman and Jason Zimba, who were assigned to assist California as official emissaries from the NGA and CCSSO.

16:48.159 --> 17:02.203
Our staff did presentations on the existing California standards, the process of international benchmarking, ways of determining college and career readiness, and most importantly, the crosswalks

17:02.856 --> 17:06.499
between California's standards and the National Common Core.

17:07.359 --> 17:18.708
We also had individual presentations by a supporter and a dissenter on the National Common Core for ELA and then again for mathematics.

17:19.428 --> 17:29.416
In short, commission members embarked upon their deliberations with a fair and balanced and substantial informational base.

17:31.070 --> 17:37.613
A key decision was to include essentially the whole of the National Common Core in the Commission's recommendation.

17:38.673 --> 17:49.917
Some had argued that the statute actually allowed something less than 100% of the Common Core standards, but the Commission did not pursue that consideration.

17:50.598 --> 17:59.481
What the Commission did do was take very seriously its authority to recommend a package of additions to the National Common Core.

18:00.254 --> 18:01.774
Our staff suggested additions.

18:02.815 --> 18:03.595
Some were accepted.

18:04.115 --> 18:05.876
Some were accepted with modifications.

18:06.396 --> 18:06.956
Some were not.

18:07.816 --> 18:10.737
Also, some of our members suggested additions again.

18:11.517 --> 18:15.598
Some were accepted, accepted with modifications, and some were not.

18:16.398 --> 18:29.122
Commissioners were guided in their decisions by a mental checklist of criteria, including whether the proposed changes were substantive, addressed perceived gaps,

18:29.989 --> 18:40.698
were defensible to practitioners, kept intact the original sense of the standards to which they would be attached, and helped ensure rigor.

18:41.638 --> 18:45.602
Ultimately, the package of ELA additions was accepted without dissent.

18:45.902 --> 18:59.373
However, the package of additions in mathematics, which thus became the vote on the final recommendation as a whole, passed by a two-thirds vote, with two members voting against and the remainder declining to vote.

19:00.015 --> 19:07.383
So clearly, the vast majority of the commission enthusiastically endorses this package and urges the state board to adopt it.

19:08.504 --> 19:15.872
Now, let's take a look at just three key proposed additions in the area of English language arts.

19:17.302 --> 19:25.905
Arguably, the most significant addition is a strand related to formal presentations in the speaking and listening domain.

19:26.785 --> 19:31.347
This strand appears in each grade level from grade 1 through grades 11, 12.

19:31.787 --> 19:41.631
The strand cycles through different types of presentations, including poetry recitation, narratives, and informational speaking.

19:42.511 --> 19:43.872
See, for example, page 21.

19:45.410 --> 19:52.136
where the strand begins in Grade 1 with memorization and recitation of poems, rhymes, and songs.

19:53.077 --> 19:56.080
Nearby, you'll see the strand continue in Grade 2.

19:56.761 --> 20:01.685
And then on page 23, it wins its way through Grade 5.

20:02.466 --> 20:08.571
And then on pages 46 to 48, you see the strand continue in Grade 6 through 12.

20:09.392 --> 20:10.073
For example,

20:10.783 --> 20:14.706
One example being grades 9-10, which is page 47 and 48.

20:15.207 --> 20:24.114
There's delivery of an informative or explanatory presentation, as well as a reprise of formal recitations such as poetry.

20:25.275 --> 20:30.659
A second area in English language arts is in the language domain in grades 2 through 4.

20:31.500 --> 20:34.602
Standards are added related to handwriting or penmanship.

20:35.303 --> 20:36.484
See, for example, page 24.

20:38.328 --> 20:49.632
where creating readable documents and legible print is added to grade 2, and then on page 26, writing fluidly and legibly in cursive or joined italics is added to grade 4.

20:50.693 --> 20:58.296
Third, I want to point out an additional footnote related to foundational skills in kindergarten, which appears on page 14.

21:00.839 --> 21:04.942
The footnote relates to major vowels and short and long vowel sounds.

21:05.342 --> 21:12.847
The commission was actually advised while we were meeting that this footnote would be added to the National Common Core.

21:12.927 --> 21:18.931
So basically, we helped you out by incorporating the new footnote among our additions.

21:19.772 --> 21:29.999
Now, various other language arts additions I'll just touch on briefly, following simple and then progressively complex directions in the early grades,

21:30.757 --> 21:49.301
providing more specificity about the use of and differentiation among pronouns, thesis statements and informational texts, alternate word choices, archetypes, one of my personal favorite, and more specific references to career development documents such as business letters.

21:50.481 --> 21:56.343
Turning next to mathematics, I'll again highlight just three of the commission proposed additions.

21:56.523 --> 21:57.083
By far,

21:58.496 --> 22:02.538
the most noteworthy addition relates to Algebra 1, which begins at page 45.

22:04.939 --> 22:13.543
As presented to you, this Algebra 1 package represents one of two options for mathematics content at grade 8.

22:14.423 --> 22:19.185
The other being the grade 8 common core itself, which begins on page 51.

22:20.806 --> 22:25.608
The grade 8 common core actually incorporates a generous portion of geometry.

22:26.261 --> 22:29.003
as preparation for algebra in high school.

22:29.764 --> 22:43.455
Now, thanks to Undersecretary Kathy Gaither, I'll skip a major part of the detail that I was going to provide about Algebra 1, but I want to highlight a couple of things that were very important to the commission.

22:43.595 --> 22:55.125
First, based on local decisions, nothing, nothing in this package prohibits this Algebra 1 package of

22:56.717 --> 23:11.124
to be, from being presented either as a traditional one-year course, as a two-year Algebra 1 course, or as a series of multiple-year integrated mathematics courses.

23:11.825 --> 23:23.691
The Algebra 1 package includes the Grade 8 Common Core, along with some Common Core high school mathematics, and parts of California's existing Algebra 1 content.

23:25.999 --> 23:48.115
And the other highlight I wanted to mention was that the most important one, which is that either of these two options provides all students in grade eight ample time in high school to complete the advanced mathematics coursework necessary for admission to a four-year college.

23:49.175 --> 23:52.718
Now, a second change in mathematics.

23:53.297 --> 24:04.066
brings down from grade 8 to grade 7, and similarly from grade 7 to grade 6, some of the content standards related to number sense and geometry.

24:04.827 --> 24:08.811
Examples of this can be seen on pages 36 and 41.

24:09.411 --> 24:16.878
The commission felt that presenting this content earlier helped strengthen students' algebra readiness by grade 8.

24:18.948 --> 24:38.382
A third key change added considerable material from California's existing standards to the common core in high school mathematics, including California's standards for calculus and for AP probability and statistics, which were added in their entirety.

24:39.583 --> 24:48.429
I will just briefly note that additions in earlier grades included clearer or stronger references, including such matters as

24:49.051 --> 25:05.002
concepts of time, relating time to events, counting by multiples, estimation strategies, verifying reasonableness, English units of measure, use of the number line, and distinguishing among shapes.

25:05.702 --> 25:18.631
Now, as I wrap up my presentation, I would like to leave you with these two thoughts, assuming that you will decide to adopt the Commission's recommendation, which you are strongly encouraged to do.

25:19.699 --> 25:32.829
First, the success or failure of this venture will depend to a great extent on the substance and the adequacy of the implementation plan.

25:33.709 --> 25:45.358
If you leave this meeting today thinking that you have done a great thing, you will be sadly mistaken if the implementation plan is skimpy or underfunded.

25:46.206 --> 25:57.651
As Dr. Michael Kirst of Stanford University reminds us, the content standards, while quite visible, are really the easiest part of a standards-based system.

25:58.411 --> 26:05.294
Creating opportunity to learn what implementation is all about is the most difficult.

26:06.075 --> 26:15.739
The implementation plan needs to address many complicated issues surrounding the transition from our current content standards to the new ones.

26:16.644 --> 26:43.846
including refinements to the new standards that you may find necessary, as well as future changes to the Common Core that will inevitably be coming along, framework development and the creation of a new ELD standards document, instructional materials selection, professional development, changes in teacher preparation, and modification of assessments.

26:45.228 --> 26:45.568
Second,

26:46.681 --> 27:08.380
and perhaps more importantly, you must ensure that this process of transition does not result in any loss of integrity or continuity in the system of accountability that California has constructed over the past dozen years, much under the leadership of Superintendent Jack O'Connell.

27:09.961 --> 27:10.382
And those

27:11.863 --> 27:22.487
Those developments have been with the considerable investment of time and money, not only by the state, but by local agencies of government as well.

27:24.127 --> 27:32.150
Be alert to excuses that begin, well, because the content standards changed.

27:33.791 --> 27:40.773
You really must not allow these new standards to become a rationale to justify declines in achievement

27:41.528 --> 27:43.209
or evasion of responsibility.

27:44.129 --> 28:03.276
If these new content standards are the keys to a shiny new car with all the latest features, then please be sure that the car is consistently well maintained, treated with respect, and always driven sensibly.

28:04.317 --> 28:04.697
Thank you.

28:05.497 --> 28:07.258
And where do I go next?

28:10.445 --> 28:12.627
You do, and we get to thank you.

28:12.667 --> 28:21.032
I know we have commissioners in the audience who would like to add comments as well.

28:21.372 --> 28:23.254
And I think that would be great.

28:23.294 --> 28:30.738
And if you don't mind, I'd love you to introduce them and help us out with this next part, Greg.

28:31.179 --> 28:39.004
But before you do, I want to thank you not only for those comments, which I think are extraordinarily good guides for us members,

28:39.642 --> 28:49.587
as we take this up but for your incredible leadership of the commission doing an impossible task in an impossible timeline with

28:50.080 --> 28:52.961
extraordinary professionalism and great grace.

28:53.281 --> 28:54.561
So thank you so much.

28:54.641 --> 28:59.463
It was a pleasure to be associated with these terrific individuals.

28:59.983 --> 29:01.723
I enjoyed that part tremendously.

29:01.863 --> 29:02.203
Great.

29:02.223 --> 29:06.164
Well, if you wouldn't mind introducing us to some of the commissioners and we could hear from them.

29:06.184 --> 29:07.465
I will be happy to do that.

29:07.485 --> 29:10.145
I hadn't anticipated you doing that.

29:10.506 --> 29:12.546
We should probably proceed alphabetically.

29:13.686 --> 29:14.927
That makes good sense to me.

29:17.651 --> 29:19.933
or just volunteers from the front of the room to the back.

29:22.716 --> 29:31.926
Let's begin with a very active commissioner in the area of mathematics, Commissioner Scott Ferrand, professor at Sacramento State.

29:32.266 --> 29:32.507
Scott.

29:38.424 --> 29:39.704
Thank you so much, Scott, for your work.

29:40.004 --> 29:40.384
Thank you.

29:40.725 --> 29:42.145
I think I get a place in heaven, don't I?

29:42.225 --> 29:43.705
Because I agree with what has been said.

29:43.745 --> 29:46.486
It's been said very well, and I don't need to take much time.

29:46.766 --> 29:47.066
Thank you.

29:47.466 --> 29:47.866
Thank you.

29:53.588 --> 29:54.828
Commissioners, are you surprised?

29:55.108 --> 29:58.329
Clearly hadn't anticipated Scott being brief.

29:59.689 --> 30:03.190
I'd also like to introduce Commissioner Pat Szabo, who helped out.

30:04.887 --> 30:08.330
at one point in time, caring temporarily.

30:12.553 --> 30:13.434
Thank you so much, Pat.

30:13.854 --> 30:17.157
I'm going to have that place in heaven right next to Scott.

30:17.938 --> 30:24.123
And at this point, I agree with everything that has been said and will come up if I disagree.

30:24.483 --> 30:24.903
Fantastic.

30:24.923 --> 30:25.283
Thank you.

30:25.444 --> 30:25.744
Thanks.

30:29.107 --> 30:33.270
And now I'd like to introduce another very active commissioner, Commissioner Zev Wurman.

30:42.239 --> 30:45.481
I think Commissioner Worman and Commissioner Evers are going to come together.

30:45.501 --> 30:48.043
And Commissioner Bill Evers.

30:51.265 --> 30:56.128
So, President Mitchell, Superintendent O'Connell, board members.

30:56.829 --> 30:57.509
I'm Bill Evers.

30:57.749 --> 30:59.731
I'm at the Hoover Institution at Stanford.

30:59.771 --> 31:02.533
This is Palo Alto businessman Zev Worman.

31:02.553 --> 31:05.094
I have five quick points to make.

31:05.315 --> 31:05.755
First of all,

31:06.576 --> 31:13.719
The K7 mathematics preparation is inadequate in these standards as they are before you.

31:14.239 --> 31:17.020
They are not going to be prepared to take algebra in grade eight.

31:17.800 --> 31:23.322
The algebra in grade eight course is overstuffed and unteachable.

31:24.002 --> 31:26.183
It is two years combined in one.

31:27.163 --> 31:31.025
It is a double dose course.

31:31.325 --> 31:33.826
74 standards instead of the normal 30 to 35.

31:36.169 --> 31:42.232
Second point, minorities and low-income students under our current standards have been doing well.

31:43.533 --> 31:50.237
They've been doubling, tripling, and quadrupling depending on which demographic you're looking at, their success rates at algebra in eighth grade.

31:51.077 --> 31:52.718
They've been catching up with other students.

31:54.159 --> 31:59.762
This adoption, if you make it, will damage severely the success.

32:00.483 --> 32:00.923
Point three.

32:03.962 --> 32:08.444
This is a major public policy shift that you're undertaking today in this decision.

32:10.205 --> 32:17.249
It's going to have a serious effect, a disparate impact, on minorities and other disadvantaged children.

32:19.030 --> 32:29.135
I think you have a moral and a legal obligation to have held regional hearings on the completed project.

32:30.049 --> 32:38.012
And in the handout that I have put before you, I give you the statutory passage that says that you must hold regional hearings.

32:39.413 --> 32:50.898
Fourth point, there's an experimental geometry matter in the standards pertaining to similar and congruent triangles.

32:51.618 --> 32:57.781
So just to refresh your minds, remember side, angle, side, angle, side, angle, and all those sorts of things.

32:59.002 --> 33:02.345
So there's a Russian mathematician.

33:04.526 --> 33:14.854
His name is Andrei Nikolaev Kolmogorov, and he invented this method that's being proposed.

33:15.794 --> 33:21.278
And he tried it in an elite, gifted and talented boarding school in Russia.

33:23.019 --> 33:23.160
And

33:24.574 --> 33:29.357
Here's what his student wrote in a famous memorial essay on this Russian mathematician.

33:29.377 --> 33:39.304
This is from his student, Vladimir Tikhomirov.

33:41.866 --> 33:50.192
It has to be honestly said that these ideas are unacceptable, unsuitable for acceptance into math schools.

33:51.184 --> 33:51.484
Okay?

33:52.024 --> 33:59.107
So this is pertaining to the thing that you, if you vote for this, are going to be imposing on the California students.

34:00.327 --> 34:09.770
And my colleague Scott Fran from the Commission said during the deliberations that this was the most worrisome thing that he found in the Common Core Standards.

34:10.251 --> 34:10.811
Final point.

34:12.772 --> 34:16.833
I would pose a challenge to all the other speakers that come before you

34:17.867 --> 34:24.170
from the CTA, from the California Federation of Teachers, from the California Mathematics Council, and other presenters.

34:25.650 --> 34:40.796
Do you regard this algebra in 8th grade package as teachable, as doable for the 60% of students that we succeed, that we have in our algebra in 8th grade now, and even for the numbers of success we have now?

34:42.337 --> 34:44.538
60%, can they take this double-disc course?

34:45.934 --> 34:54.236
If you're okay with that mathematics program, my second question, how do you regard the deprivation of opportunity to minorities and low income students?

34:55.116 --> 35:06.138
And board members, I ask you, as you listen to any of these presenters, answer these two questions about the overstuffed and about the disparate impact on minorities and low income children.

35:06.478 --> 35:08.178
Are they being forthcoming in their answers?

35:08.418 --> 35:09.419
Are they being evasive?

35:09.579 --> 35:10.499
Are they not answering?

35:11.219 --> 35:11.859
Thank you very much.

35:14.295 --> 35:17.037
Thank you, Bill, and thank you for your extraordinary work on the commission.

35:18.698 --> 35:19.219
Thank you, Zev.

35:22.061 --> 35:25.223
And next, I'd like to call up Commissioner Jim Lanich.

35:36.492 --> 35:37.012
Good morning, Jim.

35:37.213 --> 35:37.713
Good morning.

35:41.376 --> 35:43.217
President Mitchell, Superintendent O'Connell,

35:44.910 --> 35:45.390
board members.

35:48.712 --> 35:54.674
I was an inner city school teacher for a long time for Los Angeles Unified in the riot recovery area.

35:55.114 --> 36:00.236
My wife taught in the poorest square mile of the United States for most of her teaching career.

36:00.256 --> 36:03.258
We were a teaching and learning family.

36:05.198 --> 36:06.539
I went on to become a bureaucrat.

36:06.839 --> 36:11.361
I led the Los Angeles County Office of Education

36:12.602 --> 36:15.124
programs for curriculum instruction for 10 years.

36:16.626 --> 36:20.869
I worked in the 100 lowest performing schools of Los Angeles County.

36:22.631 --> 36:28.615
I went on to represent the business community for eight years in raising student academic achievement and closing the achievement gap.

36:29.456 --> 36:36.542
And I currently serve as the director of the California State University Center to close the achievement gap.

36:38.543 --> 36:39.204
Simple message.

36:41.232 --> 36:47.235
Absolute vast majority of the members on this commission have taught kids.

36:49.236 --> 36:50.097
They were excited.

36:51.257 --> 36:52.478
They liked what they saw.

36:53.499 --> 36:54.599
They improved upon it.

36:56.460 --> 37:03.424
And they're really looking forward to getting more kids to grade level than we've ever gotten in our state before.

37:04.044 --> 37:08.867
They put before you a recommendation that I think is strong and well-deserved.

37:09.952 --> 37:13.335
I appreciate your time that you've given to listen to us all today.

37:14.096 --> 37:17.639
And I am just really looking forward to getting the job done.

37:18.119 --> 37:18.460
Thank you.

37:19.020 --> 37:19.481
Thank you, Jim.

37:23.644 --> 37:29.590
And next, I'd like to invite up Commissioner Mark Freethy, who teaches mathematics in Elk Grove Unified.

37:41.207 --> 37:45.730
I was not exactly prepared to do this, but I'm happy to be here.

37:46.371 --> 37:50.694
This was a great honor to be on this commission and to have some input.

37:51.434 --> 37:51.994
I'm excited.

37:52.235 --> 37:55.777
I'm excited because in a few days, I get to start my 34th year of teaching.

37:56.858 --> 38:00.220
And I'm excited when I looked at these standards.

38:02.054 --> 38:20.690
the grassroots, when I talk to people across the state, especially elementary school teachers, and I told them what I was involved in, they were really excited that we could have some standards that they could focus on because they continued to say, there's too much.

38:22.511 --> 38:26.375
And so when we went through these standards, the practitioners

38:28.115 --> 38:32.599
unanimously, we're very, very supportive that this can work.

38:32.679 --> 38:41.306
The people that have been doing this, we've been preparing kids for algebra for years and years with high success rates in some schools.

38:44.068 --> 38:51.954
The success rate that we have, 60% of students taking algebra to me is not the scorecard.

38:52.795 --> 38:54.216
It's how many students

38:55.200 --> 38:57.761
are successfully completing Algebra at what levels.

38:58.222 --> 38:59.722
That should be our scorecard.

39:00.763 --> 39:13.309
And if you look at the data, the data suggests that the best thing we can do is prepare kids for Algebra I so that they're successful in taking Algebra I the first time they take it.

39:15.770 --> 39:16.111
Thank you.

39:16.351 --> 39:16.611
Thank you.

39:21.207 --> 39:29.830
And last, but certainly not least, my buddy from here in my days with the California Department of Education, Dr. Deborah Keys.

39:39.554 --> 39:41.616
Good morning, President Mitchell, members of the board.

39:42.056 --> 39:43.097
I'll be very, very brief.

39:43.838 --> 39:49.222
It was a privilege for me to work with the commissioners who have brought forth their recommendation to you today.

39:49.242 --> 39:56.128
I have been in education for a very long time and have great concerns about our students in California.

39:57.008 --> 40:04.491
I believe that what you have been presented with in terms of the recommendation indeed is going to support and move our kids forward.

40:05.691 --> 40:11.293
I want to also commend the work of the staff of SCOE.

40:11.933 --> 40:16.415
who enabled us to really do the job that we needed to do on a very, very short timeline.

40:16.555 --> 40:23.217
It was a very short timeline and we wouldn't have been able to do it as well as we did it without the support and the work of SCOE.

40:23.237 --> 40:27.298
So I want to publicly thank Sue Stickle and her staff.

40:27.639 --> 40:39.162
And I thank you so very much for really taking into account the valuable work and time that the expert panel actually put into making this recommendation today.

40:39.463 --> 40:40.343
And I full

40:40.903 --> 40:42.324
heartily supported.

40:42.644 --> 40:43.324
Thank you very much.

40:43.824 --> 40:44.145
Thank you.

40:47.546 --> 40:57.931
And I regret to say there's a bit of tarnish on the legend because I had been told that Deborah Keyes was the last but there is one more commissioner.

40:58.951 --> 41:00.572
Eleanor Evans is also here.

41:00.672 --> 41:00.912
Eleanor?

41:07.918 --> 41:10.540
Eleanor was simply sitting in the blind spot, that's all.

41:12.841 --> 41:16.644
Good morning, I'm Eleanor Evans from San Diego Unified School District.

41:17.405 --> 41:21.407
I am the student that Dr. Evers talked about.

41:22.148 --> 41:36.318
I am a student, I'm a part of California Public Schools, but I'm a student that struggled with math through middle school and high school, and I want to say that the math component is excellent.

41:37.998 --> 41:44.823
I only wish that my one regret about going from high school to college is that my friends didn't go with me.

41:46.164 --> 41:46.505
Okay?

41:46.925 --> 41:51.709
And the reason why was because they did not have the math background.

41:52.289 --> 41:56.652
Math, as you all know, is the gateway for college, for careers.

41:57.653 --> 42:04.999
And I would implore you to please, please support the Common Core Standards in Mathematics.

42:05.839 --> 42:06.620
Thank you very much.

42:07.674 --> 42:08.034
Thank you.

42:09.415 --> 42:09.635
Great.

42:09.815 --> 42:11.996
Thanks, thanks commissioners and board members.

42:12.036 --> 42:16.939
I hope you'd join me in a round of applause for the commissioners.

42:23.123 --> 42:35.870
Obviously for those, those who are here today, but for everyone who served so ably and public service is often thankless and it is not very often heroic and hopefully we have

42:36.340 --> 42:46.983
and will continue to provide the thanks and certainly the service was and continues to be heroic in preparing us to make the decision that's in front of us today.

42:48.303 --> 42:48.804
One second.

42:53.605 --> 42:53.805
Great.

42:54.252 --> 43:02.821
So what I'd like now to do, board members, is to see if there are any clarifying questions that you might have while you're thinking about that.

43:02.841 --> 43:13.151
I'd like to return to Greg Geeting's comments, if I might, for just a second, and see if I can remind the board of the task that's before us today.

43:13.171 --> 43:18.176
I think that Greg put it very well, so I'm really simply reinforcing points that he made.

43:18.959 --> 43:29.162
I think that it's critical as we take this up to differentiate between what we're being asked to do today and what we're not being asked to do today.

43:29.182 --> 43:36.864
And by extension, what we as a board and we as a department and the legislature will be asked to do in the future.

43:37.645 --> 43:45.387
Because I think that differentiating between those will provide us with a way of making a decision in

43:46.730 --> 43:51.614
a world that's actually very complex, but a world in which we're taking one bite today.

43:52.134 --> 43:56.117
So let me see if I can, again, emphasize some of the points that Greg made.

43:56.618 --> 44:01.161
First, by talking about what we're not being asked to do today.

44:02.062 --> 44:11.810
So I think critically, we are not being asked to determine grade-level curriculum, courses, materials, or assessments.

44:13.050 --> 44:23.677
Those are all steps in the process that, if we begin it today, will take place in an orderly fashion where we will be involved at each step of the way.

44:24.157 --> 44:27.339
But those are steps that we're not being asked to take today.

44:28.600 --> 44:35.324
We're not, even more specifically, being asked to array the proposed standards within grade levels.

44:35.965 --> 44:38.126
Many of our colleagues superintendents are here today and

44:38.864 --> 44:47.967
They will tell you that even after the frameworks are established, that's important work that they engage in with their teachers.

44:49.767 --> 45:01.351
We are not, and this is Greg, thank you so much for making this point, we are not being asked to step back, repudiate, or throw away our current standards or our system of accountability.

45:02.491 --> 45:08.153
That when we think about an implementation plan, we need to be very clear with ourselves and the field

45:08.851 --> 45:31.557
that the current standards are in place, that there's a transition to new standards, that there is work to be done on the blueprints, work to be done on materials adoptions, work to be done on assessments, and that when that work is completed, and only then, will the state transition to a system based on Common Core, if we choose to take that step today.

45:33.703 --> 45:57.463
Further, we are not being asked to redesign professional development for teachers, teacher certification for entry-level teachers, nor are we being asked today to connect the Common Core with any of those kinds of teacher professional evaluation that we've talked about in other areas of our work.

45:59.594 --> 46:04.057
So if that's not what we're being asked to do today, what is it that we're being asked to do today?

46:04.818 --> 46:12.364
And here the legislation is very specific, as are the usual ways that we operate as a board and as a system.

46:13.244 --> 46:22.191
What we are being asked to do is to adopt or reject the academic content standards that have been proposed to us.

46:23.812 --> 46:27.135
If we do so, we begin the process

46:28.280 --> 46:29.181
that Greg talked about.

46:29.281 --> 46:38.707
We begin the process of unfolding blueprints that will operationalize these standards in the lives of teachers and kids.

46:39.308 --> 46:53.258
We unfold the opportunity to create new assessments, new materials, adoptions, programs, and for those of us who've been around this particular set of decisions for a while, we know that that means that we'll be seeing more of Tom Adams

46:56.896 --> 46:59.738
as he walks us through that work.

47:00.639 --> 47:15.992
But members, as we go through our decision-making process today, I implore you, and will probably do so several times, I implore you to remember that that work, that critical, important work, is tomorrow's work, not today's work.

47:18.374 --> 47:18.814
Questions?

47:19.034 --> 47:19.415
Comments?

47:24.542 --> 47:24.982
if I may.

47:26.984 --> 47:37.833
First of all, I was very happy to hear Greg refer to the great work that was done in 1997 with our California standards.

47:38.374 --> 47:51.065
And I was also very pleased to note that, have you note, that our California standards have been, were part of the basis of the national core standards.

47:52.631 --> 47:54.412
It's a major, major step.

47:54.472 --> 48:20.372
And because we did that in 1997, it allows us, a different board, different people, but the Board of Education for the State of California, a comfortable place in order to accept this, knowing, as Ted has said, that we have a very, very long road ahead of us.

48:21.118 --> 48:23.799
And that is in every aspect of it.

48:23.879 --> 48:28.161
It's like telling your teenage daughter you can go out on a date.

48:28.901 --> 48:33.784
And then somewhere down the line, she's going to get married and have a family.

48:34.144 --> 48:37.385
Because that is, we're at the very beginning of something.

48:37.865 --> 48:45.989
I appreciate the fact that commissioners have disagreed as well as agreed with the math standards.

48:46.569 --> 48:49.450
But I also am a great believer that

48:51.496 --> 49:00.558
from way back in graduate school that if you set high standards, you will teach to high standards and it will happen.

49:01.018 --> 49:16.600
I mean, I have been pleased in my many visits to schools over the years as a board member to have seen classrooms where teachers have been trained and teach the state standards in their classes, in their classrooms.

49:17.620 --> 49:20.681
Very different from the days when I was a teacher and

49:21.221 --> 49:23.781
I didn't even know what a curriculum was.

49:24.122 --> 49:27.522
And it was in the bottom drawer, I think, on the right.

49:27.742 --> 49:30.123
So, and inventing my own way.

49:30.563 --> 49:35.304
But I am comfortable with this first step.

49:36.004 --> 49:47.586
I am also comfortable with the fact that it has been, that there are 30 states that have agreed to this, and that a great portion is, was done through California.

49:47.606 --> 49:49.086
I appreciate Sue's work.

49:50.113 --> 49:59.281
And I look forward to seeing what this board and this office and this state is going to do to make this a reality in the future.

49:59.301 --> 50:00.642
So, thank you.

50:01.602 --> 50:02.683
Thank you, Vice President Blum.

50:02.743 --> 50:08.228
And just as a reminder to board members, I hope that we could use this as an opportunity to ask some clarifying questions.

50:08.248 --> 50:08.668
We've got

50:10.399 --> 50:15.323
quite a lineup, Nick and I were conferring, quite a lineup of people who would like to provide public comment.

50:15.363 --> 50:22.830
I want to turn to that in just a minute so that we can hear from the public and then move to take action.

50:23.130 --> 50:23.891
Are you all right with that?

50:24.131 --> 50:26.333
Okay, David, are you all right to turn to, great.

50:26.733 --> 50:29.876
So I'd like to now turn to public comment.

50:30.016 --> 50:37.723
We have over 25 people signed up for public comment, and given the hour, and Mr. Superintendent, I know we've got a clock to watch.

50:39.023 --> 50:46.325
I would love members of the public to keep their comment in this instance to one minute.

50:51.186 --> 50:52.687
Beth?

50:52.747 --> 50:56.467
The first three are Arun Ramanath.

50:56.527 --> 51:00.528
I apologize.

51:01.369 --> 51:06.010
Sherry Griffith and Shelley Krieger.

51:06.370 --> 51:07.010
Great, thank you.

51:08.106 --> 51:08.686
Good morning, Arun.

51:09.107 --> 51:14.850
Good morning, State Board President Mitchell, Superintendent O'Connell, and members of the Board, State Board of Education.

51:15.671 --> 51:24.096
My name is Arun Ramanathan and on behalf of the, of my colleagues at the Education Trust West, I thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today.

51:24.936 --> 51:33.181
While we realize that there are many important issues before you, none is as closely watched as the decision on the Common Core Standards and the Commission's recommendations.

51:34.302 --> 51:37.704
California has long been a leader in both standards and assessments.

51:38.368 --> 51:44.210
We at the Education Trust West have long been advocates for increasing the rigor of our standards and graduation requirements.

51:44.230 --> 51:44.791
Thirty seconds.

51:45.011 --> 51:49.713
With the goal of ensuring that all of our high school graduates have a true choice between college and career.

51:50.493 --> 51:59.557
We've consistently highlighted the opportunity and achievement gaps that prevent so many students of color and students in poverty in our state from achieving college and career readiness.

52:00.197 --> 52:05.279
And over the past eight years, we have pressed you consistently to close those opportunity and achievement gaps.

52:05.359 --> 52:05.719
One minute.

52:05.979 --> 52:08.060
And live up to the promise of our rigorous standards.

52:08.942 --> 52:22.285
While we understand that the adoption of the Common Core will not by itself close those opportunity and achievement gaps, we do believe that adoption of the Common Core and the Commission's recommendations is an important step in the right direction.

52:23.505 --> 52:33.407
First and foremost, the Common Core were built upon a clear determination of what students need to know by the end of high school in order to be college and career ready.

52:34.347 --> 52:34.647
Second,

52:35.387 --> 52:38.890
The college and career standards are benchmarked against international standards.

52:39.350 --> 52:50.260
And third, by focusing on depth instead of breadth, the standards present a true pathway and a true promise for our students of color and students in poverty in the state of California.

52:51.180 --> 52:57.246
As a result, we do hope that you adopt the Common Core and we do hope that you take the Commission's recommendations.

52:57.566 --> 52:57.886
Thank you.

52:58.827 --> 53:01.109
Thank you very much and thank you for making the trip here today.

53:04.417 --> 53:09.701
Good morning board members, Superintendent O'Connell, Sherry Griffith with the Association of California School Administrators.

53:10.301 --> 53:20.949
We are absolutely thrilled and pleased to support the recommendation of the Commission, both with the Common Core and the strengthening through California specific standards.

53:21.649 --> 53:22.690
Our position is twofold.

53:23.050 --> 53:27.572
One is that we strongly support the Common Core and the California-specific standards.

53:27.992 --> 53:37.917
And secondly, AXA has made as one of its highest priorities a comprehensive, fully-funded implementation plan of Common Core, if you adopt today.

53:38.578 --> 53:40.419
We commit to that over the next five years.

53:40.859 --> 53:46.722
We believe it's critical for stakeholders and policymakers to, in a collaborative fashion, work closely together

53:47.202 --> 53:50.184
We want to commend the stellar work of the Commission.

53:50.345 --> 53:52.546
You would be so proud of these educators.

53:52.606 --> 53:57.991
We were there witnessing firsthand their work, the stellar work of Sue Stickle and her staff.

53:58.971 --> 54:00.693
It was just a phenomenal experience.

54:00.713 --> 54:03.075
We had to bring sleeping bags, I think, almost a couple nights.

54:03.995 --> 54:05.215
It was excellent.

54:05.656 --> 54:11.937
I think what you'll see in the recommendations is not only the strength of Common Core, but where these content experts took it further.

54:12.357 --> 54:15.478
In ELA, where they added what we needed in formal presentations.

54:15.958 --> 54:22.760
In math, for the first time, and so historic, that we're going to have eighth grade Common Core math standards.

54:23.420 --> 54:25.141
and Algebra I as an option.

54:25.501 --> 54:26.141
Think about this.

54:26.361 --> 54:32.082
Our administrators will no longer have to relegate kids to repeat 6th and 7th grade standards.

54:32.422 --> 54:38.084
And as Kathy Gaither said, for the first time, you're going to have two options for college readiness.

54:38.144 --> 54:38.944
We are so proud.

54:38.984 --> 54:39.344
Thank you.

54:40.104 --> 54:40.744
Thank you very much.

54:45.626 --> 54:50.847
And I do appreciate everybody working through their remarks in a sub-two-minute fashion.

54:50.867 --> 54:51.547
It's very helpful.

54:52.216 --> 54:56.418
Well, then you'll be happy with me because I agree with what everyone has said except Bill Evers.

54:57.198 --> 55:08.063
I'm Shelly Kriegler, and I flew up here today because I wanted to endorse your, encourage you to adopt these standards, and I thank you very much for your work.

55:08.323 --> 55:10.003
Thank you very much, and thanks for making the trip.

55:12.244 --> 55:15.446
OK, the next three, if you'd line up so we can move through quickly.

55:15.466 --> 55:21.248
Doug McRae, Katlyn Latimer, and Juan Godinez.

55:24.555 --> 55:24.936
Good morning.

55:25.016 --> 55:32.582
I'm Dr. Gray, a retired test publisher from Monterey, and a veteran of the war of 1997 over California content standards.

55:33.422 --> 55:37.305
I'd urge a yes, comma, but vote.

55:37.946 --> 55:53.398
And I must say that I've heard a lot of the conversation regarding the comma, but part of it because the comma, but in my urging has to do with the implementation of them.

55:55.381 --> 56:05.125
Frankly, you're under the gun with $700 million potentially on the table, and that's a practical matter when the family is hungry.

56:05.666 --> 56:10.528
There is a responsibility to put food on the table, and so I understand that.

56:10.828 --> 56:19.371
On the merits, the Standards Commission recommendation, especially for math, looks like a horse designed by a committee with an unknown number of humps, not unlike a camel.

56:22.364 --> 56:29.687
Content standards need to have a strong horse, you've talked about this, capable of pulling five standards-based carts.

56:30.108 --> 56:35.030
Curriculum frameworks, instructional materials, professional development, assessments, and accountability systems.

56:35.770 --> 56:39.932
The content standards as they currently exist are not ready to pull those carts.

56:41.313 --> 56:48.736
There's a DC policy wonk that said that the rush to common core standards this summer is not like joining a fitness club.

56:49.528 --> 56:59.516
A lot of claims for benefits before the first workout or the workout schedule has been determined, etc.

56:59.957 --> 57:02.158
That's all the stuff that's in front of you.

57:02.178 --> 57:10.926
And so I go ahead and urge you to do it, but do pay attention to the implementation issues.

57:11.086 --> 57:15.890
There are some major implementation issues that may need revision of the standards before you can do them.

57:16.430 --> 57:16.730
Thank you.

57:17.131 --> 57:17.491
Thank you, Doug.

57:23.800 --> 57:24.361
Good morning.

57:25.282 --> 57:29.026
I'm Kathleen Latimer, President-Elect of the California Mathematics Council.

57:29.727 --> 57:40.418
And to the point, California Mathematics Council endorses the recommendation of the Academic Content Standards Commission for adoption of the Augmented Common Course Standards.

57:41.239 --> 57:56.167
We feel that the newly recommended standards provide an opportunity for K-8 students to build a solid foundation with experiences in mathematical thinking that lead to stronger and deeper understanding of mathematics.

57:56.868 --> 58:02.211
A few argue that the recommended standards will not prepare students to take Algebra I in 8th grade.

58:02.791 --> 58:03.892
CMC disagrees.

58:04.312 --> 58:11.318
In primary grades, these standards emphasize number sense and other foundational skills critical for success in mathematics.

58:12.018 --> 58:21.566
Many students who struggle in algebra are weak in these skills, and that creates a poor understanding of important topics.

58:22.206 --> 58:26.468
It's important that students are successful the first time they take algebra.

58:27.209 --> 58:38.474
CMC supports the commission's recommendation that generates opportunities for success at grade 8 algebra as well as grade 8 standards.

58:40.208 --> 58:47.274
While some may see this as tracking, CMC sees this as an alternative to repeating courses.

58:47.814 --> 58:55.400
So we do stand firmly behind the standards as augmented and presented.

58:55.901 --> 59:01.145
Finally, we'd like to congratulate the members of the Academic Content Standards Commission for their commitment

59:01.705 --> 59:12.435
to improve education and know that the California Mathematics Council stands ready to support all aspects for successful implementation of these Common Core Standards.

59:12.815 --> 59:13.095
Thank you.

59:13.115 --> 59:13.756
Thank you very much.
