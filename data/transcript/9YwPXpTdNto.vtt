WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.800
We are live, welcome, welcome back.

00:10.800 --> 00:16.360
We're continuing our March meeting and before we get started I want to congratulate members

00:16.360 --> 00:25.420
Lewis and Olken and Orozco-Gonzalez on their confirmation by the Senate last week.

00:25.420 --> 00:30.140
The breadth and depth of knowledge they displayed was just incredible and it was obvious that

00:30.140 --> 00:35.100
the Senators on the Rules Committee were all very impressed and congratulations, I'm proud

00:35.100 --> 00:40.260
to serve with each and every one of you and we're thrilled that you are back with us.

00:40.260 --> 00:43.900
I'd like to welcome all the board members, staff and members of the public who are attending

00:43.900 --> 00:45.860
this board meeting in person.

00:45.860 --> 00:51.340
This is the first in-person meeting of the SBE for several months and hopefully we'll

00:51.340 --> 00:54.380
be able to continue meeting in person this year.

00:54.380 --> 00:59.100
That being said, I'd like to strongly encourage everyone in the boardroom to wear masks.

00:59.100 --> 01:04.660
Masks are available in the back of the room if you need one and thank you for your consideration.

01:04.660 --> 01:07.940
There is one item on the agenda that has an addendum.

01:07.940 --> 01:13.460
Item two, the State Board of Education Screening Committee recommendations regarding appointments

01:13.460 --> 01:18.900
to the Advisory Commission on Special Education.

01:19.900 --> 01:25.100
The proposed waiver consent items are W1 through W12.

01:25.100 --> 01:29.460
The proposed regular consent items are items 6 through 8.

01:29.460 --> 01:33.140
There are no public hearings on this agenda.

01:33.140 --> 01:39.700
We will reopen item two, State Board Priorities before lunch to hear from State Superintendent

01:39.700 --> 01:41.120
Tony Thurmond.

01:41.120 --> 01:46.140
We will reopen item two again later this afternoon to take action on the preliminary report

01:46.220 --> 01:54.740
of actions, draft January 2023 meeting minutes and to take up appointments to advisory commissions

01:54.740 --> 01:57.540
and to report on our liaison assignments.

01:57.540 --> 02:02.180
I will note that because of the impending weather that everyone is probably aware of

02:02.180 --> 02:06.980
if you've been watching the news, that we are going to try to move expeditiously through

02:06.980 --> 02:12.220
our agenda with the hope of ending a bit early so that people can get safely on their road

02:12.220 --> 02:14.300
home.

02:14.300 --> 02:18.820
And we may not take as many breaks, I want to also encourage members of the board to

02:18.820 --> 02:24.060
take a break when you need one and we will try to keep things moving along.

02:24.060 --> 02:30.260
I'd also like to call your attention to corrections to W5 that were posted last Friday and a correction

02:30.260 --> 02:35.900
to item 10 and item 10 attachment one to correct errors regarding the charter school revolving

02:35.900 --> 02:43.060
loan amount from $86,002 to $86,668.

02:43.100 --> 02:48.940
The corrected figures are on page five of item 10 and page four of item 10 attachment

02:48.940 --> 02:49.940
one.

02:49.940 --> 02:55.620
The corrections to item 10 were posted on Tuesday, March 7th, 2023.

02:55.620 --> 03:01.340
In terms of public comment, we will accept public comment either in person or by phone.

03:01.340 --> 03:04.920
Members of the public wishing to call in for public comment should view the live stream

03:04.920 --> 03:09.800
of the meeting to know at what time public comment will occur for each item.

03:09.800 --> 03:13.880
Public comment may be provided by dialing the phone number, entering our participant

03:13.880 --> 03:18.440
access code, and then following each of the operator's prompts.

03:18.440 --> 03:22.000
Upon dialing in, callers will be added to a caller queue.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.720
The operator will notify callers when it is their turn to provide public comment.

03:26.720 --> 03:30.960
We will also ask callers to please turn down the speaker volume of their computers if they

03:30.960 --> 03:35.840
are following the live webcast to avoid an echoing effect.

03:35.840 --> 03:40.200
Members of the public wishing to provide public comment in person should sign in using the

03:40.200 --> 03:43.360
binder at the table just outside the room.

03:43.360 --> 03:47.760
The binder is on the table with separate pages for each item number.

03:47.760 --> 03:52.680
This will help ensure that the staff is able to track the in-person speakers for a particular

03:52.680 --> 03:54.180
item.

03:54.180 --> 03:57.660
Public comment will be limited to one minute for each speaker.

03:57.660 --> 04:01.960
Item 11 is the general public comment item during which members of the public may provide

04:01.960 --> 04:07.520
public comment on matters that are not specifically listed on the board's agenda.

04:07.520 --> 04:13.960
I'll now open item 2, which is our state board projects and priorities item, and I will give

04:13.960 --> 04:20.040
my report and then the superintendent will give his report later today.

04:20.040 --> 04:25.200
So we are in March, and there is an old saying that March comes in like a lion and goes out

04:25.200 --> 04:26.480
like a lamb.

04:26.480 --> 04:31.440
I think we're ready for the lamb, given our unusually severe winter weather, but we're

04:31.680 --> 04:32.680
not there yet.

04:32.680 --> 04:38.080
So as you know, the succession of winter storms that we've been experiencing has impacted

04:38.080 --> 04:43.140
almost everyone with a range of issues from power outages to dangerous road conditions

04:43.140 --> 04:44.140
to flooding.

04:44.140 --> 04:47.440
Our schools have not escaped impact.

04:47.440 --> 04:52.440
Flooding earlier this year led to the destruction of schools in some rural areas where creeks

04:52.440 --> 04:55.160
and rivers crested their banks.

04:55.160 --> 04:57.120
Extreme weather does keep on coming.

04:57.160 --> 05:04.120
On Monday, 334 schools across 24 counties were closed due to the impacts of snow levels

05:04.120 --> 05:06.500
that we have not seen for decades.

05:06.500 --> 05:10.600
Those school closures affected 91,000 students.

05:10.600 --> 05:15.280
I want to thank our school administrators, facilities teams, teachers, and parents for

05:15.280 --> 05:21.120
working hard to put the safety of students and staff first despite this seemingly never

05:21.120 --> 05:24.480
ending series of storms.

05:24.480 --> 05:28.120
And unfortunately, the forecast calls for more bad weather this week.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.880
So more lion until we get to the lamb.

05:30.880 --> 05:36.920
We're in for another atmospheric river effect starting this afternoon through the weekend.

05:36.920 --> 05:44.360
So as I noted, I will try to expedite today's meeting so that we can get everyone home safely.

05:44.360 --> 05:49.160
Because of the ongoing climate disruptions we can expect to have, I believe we should

05:49.160 --> 05:54.520
be considering how to rekindle the continuous instruction plans that we ask districts to

05:54.520 --> 05:56.960
develop during the height of the pandemic.

05:56.960 --> 06:01.440
So there is a plan for moving to online instruction whenever students are prevented from coming

06:01.440 --> 06:07.080
to school, whether it's because of illness, quarantine, flooding, mudslides, fires, or

06:07.080 --> 06:08.740
anything else.

06:08.740 --> 06:14.660
So I think that's something we can be thinking about in the months to come.

06:14.660 --> 06:18.920
On the good news side, of course, March is more than a month of fickle weather.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.600
It's a month full of school celebration days.

06:21.600 --> 06:25.880
One is Read Across America Day, which was celebrated last Thursday.

06:25.880 --> 06:30.120
Read Across America Day is an opportunity for adults to demonstrate to children just

06:30.120 --> 06:34.860
how much joy can be derived from sitting down with a good book.

06:34.860 --> 06:38.580
And it's also an opportunity to reflect on everything the state has been doing these

06:38.580 --> 06:43.680
past four years to ensure that California students become proficient readers who enjoy

06:43.680 --> 06:44.680
reading.

06:44.680 --> 06:50.240
Some of the highlights of those investments include the $7.9 billion for learning recovery

06:50.240 --> 06:56.920
support, including both before and after school instructional time, summer school, and tutoring,

06:56.920 --> 07:02.600
$250 million for literacy coaches and reading specialists, and a request in this budget

07:02.600 --> 07:08.480
for an additional $250 million, $15 million to support teachers to receive their supplementary

07:08.480 --> 07:14.260
state certification in reading and literacy, $50 million for teacher professional development

07:14.260 --> 07:20.580
on learning acceleration in literacy, mathematics, and language development, $68 million for

07:20.580 --> 07:23.440
Dolly Parton's Imagination Library.

07:23.440 --> 07:29.780
Kids get a free book mailed to them every month to ensure book-rich households, $28

07:29.780 --> 07:34.300
million for early literacy through a partnership with First Five California.

07:34.300 --> 07:38.860
Of course, more needs to be done, and all of this work needs to continue and deepen.

07:38.860 --> 07:43.260
In this year's budget, Governor Newsom has proposed to launch a literacy roadmap that

07:43.260 --> 07:47.220
will provide more explicit guidance about how the state's curriculum framework can

07:47.220 --> 07:52.660
be translated into instructional practices in elementary school classrooms, serving both

07:52.660 --> 07:56.060
native English speakers and new English learners.

07:56.060 --> 08:02.300
And as TK, Transitional Kindergarten, begins its expansion, we're also deepening the PK

08:02.300 --> 08:07.960
foundations in literacy and math so there'll be a seamless learning continuum with useful

08:07.960 --> 08:13.400
teaching and assessments from preschool through the primary grades.

08:13.400 --> 08:17.920
I had the opportunity to discuss the state's literacy work last week when I was invited

08:17.920 --> 08:23.720
to make remarks on the state of public education before the assembly education committee.

08:23.720 --> 08:27.900
It was a privilege to address Chair Maruzuchi and other members of the committee and take

08:27.900 --> 08:32.840
stock of where our students and schools are in the wake of the pandemic and our efforts

08:32.840 --> 08:35.600
to support them in full recovery.

08:35.640 --> 08:40.200
One point I raised is that while literacy is very important, we also need to do more

08:40.200 --> 08:43.360
to improve student performance in mathematics.

08:43.360 --> 08:47.200
California is further behind in math than in literacy.

08:47.200 --> 08:52.720
We lost almost no ground in literacy during the pandemic, and none at all in eighth grade.

08:52.720 --> 08:59.920
But in math, we lost less ground than other states, but we still fell backwards from where

08:59.920 --> 09:03.080
we had been, both on state and national assessments.

09:03.080 --> 09:07.800
And we have too few students succeeding in launching careers in STEM to meet our state's

09:07.800 --> 09:09.400
economic needs.

09:09.400 --> 09:13.720
As you know, teams are working on a new mathematics curriculum framework to provide guidance on

09:13.720 --> 09:18.820
best instructional practices to help students master our rigorous Common Core math standards,

09:18.820 --> 09:24.520
and we hope to have the opportunity to consider that framework at one of our very soon upcoming

09:24.520 --> 09:26.040
meetings.

09:26.040 --> 09:29.560
Once we have a new framework, we'll need to expand professional development to help teachers

09:29.560 --> 09:33.520
more effectively reach and teach all of their students.

09:33.520 --> 09:38.680
And thinking about the joy of math brings me to the next March celebration day.

09:38.680 --> 09:42.760
March 15th is Pi Day.

09:42.760 --> 09:47.960
And there will be places all around the state that not only are celebrating 3.1416, whatever

09:47.960 --> 09:51.040
it is, but also eating pies.

09:51.040 --> 09:57.720
So I hope that our math teachers can be very creative with Pi Day parties, and I look forward

09:57.720 --> 10:01.440
to hearing about the fun activities planned for students.

10:01.440 --> 10:05.880
And finally, March is Women's History Month, a time to look back on how four women have

10:05.880 --> 10:10.880
progressed, marvel at the brave women who often defied the establishment to inch the

10:10.880 --> 10:13.640
world closer to equality.

10:13.640 --> 10:16.100
Yesterday was International Women's Day.

10:16.100 --> 10:22.080
This year's theme, DIGITAL, Innovation in Technology for Gender Equity, highlights the

10:22.080 --> 10:26.540
role of innovative technology in promoting gender equality and meeting the health and

10:26.580 --> 10:29.060
developmental needs of women and girls.

10:29.060 --> 10:35.380
If you want an inspiring and educative opportunity to recognize this theme, I recommend celebrating

10:35.380 --> 10:41.460
by watching or re-watching Hidden Figures, the true story of a group of brilliant black

10:41.460 --> 10:46.900
women who began working as mathematicians at NASA in the 1960s as part of the Mercury

10:46.900 --> 10:48.520
Project.

10:48.520 --> 10:52.940
Working under segregated conditions, they were hired to calculate complicated aeronautic

10:53.020 --> 10:58.900
data, even before computers were available to determine launch and landing coordinates.

10:58.900 --> 11:04.140
In 1962, Mary Jackson, Katherine Johnson, and Dorothy Vaughn were among those who helped

11:04.140 --> 11:07.980
to send John Glenn, the first American astronaut, into orbit.

11:07.980 --> 11:11.820
And Glenn himself said that if Katherine Johnson reviewed the equations and the numbers for

11:11.820 --> 11:16.660
the flight, he felt safe and was ready to take off.

11:16.660 --> 11:21.540
Johnson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Obama in 2015, and

11:21.860 --> 11:28.180
last year, in 2022, she was honored at the age of 97 by NASA when they dedicated a building

11:28.180 --> 11:31.700
in her name at the Langley Research Center in Virginia.

11:31.700 --> 11:36.500
However, she and her colleagues worked in obscurity and in great odds for many, many

11:36.500 --> 11:37.500
years.

11:37.500 --> 11:42.100
And women all over the world do extraordinary things that help their families, the children

11:42.100 --> 11:47.740
in their classrooms, and the members of society every day, usually without recognition or

11:47.740 --> 11:48.740
reward.

11:48.860 --> 11:53.180
So I do want to thank all the women here and across our state for everything you've done

11:53.180 --> 11:59.220
and will do to make a difference in the lives of California students and families.

11:59.220 --> 12:03.660
And Naomi, you have some great role models here, and we have some great expectations

12:03.660 --> 12:06.060
for you.

12:06.060 --> 12:09.940
And with that, we are ready to launch our March meeting.

12:09.940 --> 12:20.580
As I said, we'll resume this item when Superintendent Tony Thurmond joins us and move on to item

12:20.580 --> 12:21.900
three.

12:21.900 --> 12:25.700
Item three is the update on the implementation of the integrated local, state, and federal

12:25.700 --> 12:29.660
accountability and continuous improvement system.

12:29.660 --> 12:35.980
And the California Department of Education recommends that we provide guidance on the

12:35.980 --> 12:41.460
proposed 2023 accountability work plan and take additional action as deemed necessary

12:41.460 --> 12:42.780
and appropriate.

12:42.780 --> 12:46.380
And this item will be presented by Cindy Kazanis of the CDE.

12:46.380 --> 12:48.420
Cindy, please begin.

12:48.420 --> 12:49.580
Thank you.

12:49.580 --> 12:52.300
Thank you very much, President Darling-Hammond.

12:52.300 --> 12:57.620
It is wonderful to welcome you all to this building at the California Department of Education.

12:57.620 --> 13:04.700
I just began my 20th year here, and there has been so many changes in those two decades.

13:04.940 --> 13:12.220
I'm super excited to have people in the building and to be able to see you in person as well,

13:12.220 --> 13:14.380
so welcome.

13:14.380 --> 13:18.940
Today we are going to cover a couple of topics related to accountability.

13:18.940 --> 13:25.380
Last year we spent a lot of time trying to, I think, bring you all up to speed on what

13:25.380 --> 13:30.580
the accountability system has been, how it was developed since it was done with a prior

13:30.580 --> 13:33.460
board, and where we were headed.

13:33.500 --> 13:39.220
And so today is really that time to reflect on what happened last year, what our student

13:39.220 --> 13:45.900
outcomes were, potential revisions to the Dashboard, as well as our numerous opportunities

13:45.900 --> 13:53.300
for engagement with the field, with practitioners, and our colleagues across the street and the

13:53.300 --> 13:56.420
legislature, as well as education advocates.

13:57.420 --> 14:05.700
So these are the three attachments that you see in your agenda today, and the recommendation

14:05.700 --> 14:11.100
is that the Department of Education recommends the State Board provide guidance on the proposed

14:11.100 --> 14:17.260
2023 Accountability Work Plan and take additional action as necessary and appropriate.

14:17.260 --> 14:21.060
Just to pause here, this is your opportunity to weigh in on our work plan.

14:21.060 --> 14:25.580
We have six months between this meeting and September when you will make decisions that

14:25.580 --> 14:30.460
will influence what we do to process the data that we receive from local educational

14:30.460 --> 14:36.940
agencies over the summer and start working through the metrics to produce the Dashboard

14:36.940 --> 14:38.260
in December.

14:38.260 --> 14:43.500
So each of these topics have been planned to the week, I think.

14:43.500 --> 14:49.100
Kimberly will talk a little bit more about that with the mindset of having, we've worked

14:49.100 --> 14:52.820
through what kind of stakeholder engagement we need to do, and ultimately bringing it

14:52.820 --> 14:57.140
to the California Practitioners Advisory Group in August.

14:57.140 --> 15:01.060
Due to, again, this limited timeframe, if there's things that you want to add, this

15:01.060 --> 15:07.900
is the meeting to do that and have that conversation, as opposed to if we come back in May or June

15:07.900 --> 15:11.260
or July, rather, and there's things that you're interested in doing, we would have

15:11.260 --> 15:15.220
to probably wait until the 2024 Dashboard.

15:15.220 --> 15:20.820
So let's move into what happened this last year, and just as a great reminder, because

15:20.820 --> 15:25.480
we saw a variety of things come through in the correspondence, the purpose of the Dashboard

15:25.480 --> 15:31.220
is to provide parents and educators with information on school and district progress so they can

15:31.220 --> 15:34.060
participate in decisions to improve student learning.

15:34.060 --> 15:40.140
That said, the Dashboard is our metric to also identify or show which schools and districts

15:40.140 --> 15:43.580
may be eligible under accountability for support.

15:43.580 --> 15:45.860
It's also used to provide awards to districts.

15:45.860 --> 15:47.480
It's used for grant purposes.

15:47.480 --> 15:53.240
It's used to designate schools that will be visited through the Williams Act, and so

15:53.240 --> 15:58.720
the life of the Dashboard goes well beyond the original purpose, but just to frame what

15:58.720 --> 16:04.160
the intent was when you all adopted this or the previous board adopted it, this is what

16:04.160 --> 16:06.560
we have today.

16:06.560 --> 16:14.000
And so in summary, we have, of course, this last year we were able to report out on five

16:14.600 --> 16:18.160
of our six indicators.

16:18.160 --> 16:23.840
We talk about English language arts and mathematics as the academic indicator.

16:23.840 --> 16:28.580
Of course, our college and career indicator we're not able to report out on because our

16:28.580 --> 16:34.400
graduating 12th graders did not take the CASP at a widespread rate because there was flexibility

16:34.400 --> 16:37.640
provided by the Board of Education.

16:37.640 --> 16:43.860
You can see that the metrics shift, the labels shift for chronic and for suspension because

16:43.860 --> 16:50.060
we are not looking for, the goal is to get to very low on chronic and suspension, not

16:50.060 --> 16:54.980
to have very high, as opposed to when we're looking at our English learner progress indicator

16:54.980 --> 16:59.720
and our mathematics indicator, we're making sure that we want to see very high.

16:59.720 --> 17:05.540
That said, we saw strong performance for a couple of indicators.

17:05.540 --> 17:12.420
We still have, of course, a lot of room to go, but between our suspension rates, keeping

17:12.500 --> 17:17.980
those low and making sure that our students are graduating within that four or five year

17:17.980 --> 17:23.500
period for our graduation rate.

17:23.500 --> 17:28.780
So just a couple of pieces around chronic absenteeism because that is going to be the

17:28.780 --> 17:32.680
focus of my remarks on student outcomes today.

17:32.680 --> 17:37.440
We have two different metrics or two different reporting opportunities for these data.

17:37.440 --> 17:42.320
The dashboard is adopted because of the Every Student Succeeds Act requirement to have a

17:42.320 --> 17:45.280
balance of indicators for grade spans.

17:45.280 --> 17:48.080
The metric for K-8 is chronic absenteeism.

17:48.080 --> 17:51.200
The equivalent for high school is our graduation rate.

17:51.200 --> 17:55.600
And so there's another resource that the department supports called DataQuest, which

17:55.600 --> 17:58.440
has been around longer than I have in this department.

17:58.440 --> 18:05.740
And so that particular resource provides static data or rather data without a metric attached

18:05.740 --> 18:06.740
to it.

18:06.740 --> 18:08.580
So that's going to be the raw data on DataQuest.

18:08.580 --> 18:15.860
We also provide information around our nonpublic schools and through their LEA reports.

18:15.860 --> 18:17.940
And then there's a series of filters on DataQuest.

18:17.940 --> 18:22.020
So I wanted to just point out that this is available and we're going to walk through

18:22.020 --> 18:27.020
a couple of reports that will show the DataQuest data as well as Dashboard.

18:27.020 --> 18:32.940
So for Dashboard, we of course saw that 30 percent of our students in K-8 were chronically

18:33.000 --> 18:39.500
absent, which of course resulted in a very high status on the Dashboard.

18:39.500 --> 18:45.400
The equity report, as you can see on the bottom left-hand side, shows that of our 13 student

18:45.400 --> 18:49.520
groups, 11 of those student groups were very high and the remaining two student groups

18:49.520 --> 18:50.520
were high.

18:50.520 --> 18:55.880
So we didn't see any at the state level, any student groups in medium, low or very

18:55.880 --> 19:02.400
low, which is very concerning.

19:02.400 --> 19:06.080
You can see on the right-hand side, the reason I included this in here is when you click

19:06.080 --> 19:09.080
through, view more details, this is what shows up.

19:09.080 --> 19:13.360
It also gives you the short description of what the definition of chronic absenteeism

19:13.360 --> 19:18.920
is on the Dashboard, which of course looks at students who are absent 10 percent or more

19:18.920 --> 19:20.920
of the instructional days enrolled.

19:20.920 --> 19:25.440
So if a student was there for 40 days and they were absent more than 10 percent of those

19:25.440 --> 19:27.520
days, they'd be considered chronically absent.

19:27.520 --> 19:31.400
We capture all of that through our student notable data system.

19:31.400 --> 19:38.560
And so these couple of slides are information that is taken from DataQuest, and what I like

19:38.560 --> 19:43.480
about this information is it provides you the historical pre-pandemic levels.

19:43.480 --> 19:48.480
So the first year of this data collection for chronic absenteeism was 2016-17.

19:48.480 --> 19:53.880
That first year, we knew it was going to take a bit of a lift for districts to report out

19:53.880 --> 19:58.600
on this data, and in fact, we had a couple of larger districts that said that they didn't

19:58.600 --> 20:00.880
have any students that were chronically absent.

20:00.880 --> 20:05.720
And so we knew that there were some data quality issues we needed to work with our local educational

20:05.720 --> 20:07.360
agencies on.

20:07.360 --> 20:14.860
So you see this very slight shift from 2016 to 2017 to 2018, very small increments of

20:14.860 --> 20:17.240
increase in chronic absenteeism.

20:17.240 --> 20:23.600
In 2019-20, we were unable to determine that the data was valid or reliable because of

20:23.600 --> 20:30.200
the way students were exited out of the system when schools shut down in March due to COVID.

20:30.200 --> 20:36.840
So that information was not processed, and we did not report out on that information.

20:36.840 --> 20:45.280
For 2020-21, that first year of students starting to return to the classroom after the winter

20:45.280 --> 20:51.120
break and when vaccinations sort of started to become available, maybe for adults I think

20:51.120 --> 20:56.960
was more so the case, the chronic absenteeism rate at that point was 14.3, and then of course

20:57.120 --> 21:02.000
we hit this record number in 2021-2022 of 30%.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.840
This is K-12.

21:03.840 --> 21:07.560
So let's go into a different report.

21:07.560 --> 21:10.040
This is something that is unique to California.

21:10.040 --> 21:12.600
I'm very proud of this report.

21:12.600 --> 21:17.800
We've gotten actually researchers that have done work on this, and I know that Attendance

21:17.800 --> 21:23.920
Works has spent a lot of time looking at these numbers and uses these publicly.

21:23.920 --> 21:30.440
And so the absenteeism by reason is using information we receive from districts when

21:30.440 --> 21:39.440
they report to us around how many days a student attended, and then how many days they did

21:39.440 --> 21:40.600
not attend.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.160
So it's expected days and then actual attended.

21:43.160 --> 21:46.000
We don't know if those are Mondays or Tuesdays or Wednesdays.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.480
We don't know if it's due to COVID.

21:47.480 --> 21:50.880
We don't know if it's because they went out of state on a vacation.

21:50.880 --> 21:56.800
But we do know the number of absences, and we do know the reasons for those absences.

21:56.800 --> 22:00.040
So these next two slides show both of those things.

22:00.040 --> 22:04.720
And I think this report is really significant because you see between the pre-COVID years

22:04.720 --> 22:13.600
of an average rate of under 10, 10 days absent, 9.3 and 9.8 respectively for 2018 and 2019,

22:13.600 --> 22:19.600
increased to the COVID, post-COVID year, or middle of COVID year rather, at 13.3 days,

22:19.640 --> 22:22.120
and a jump to 16.7.

22:22.120 --> 22:26.440
We also see over a million students who had one or more absences.

22:26.440 --> 22:32.040
So this shows you the breadth and the depth of the effect on chronic absenteeism.

22:32.040 --> 22:36.520
Superintendent Thurman was asked last week at a hearing around like, what are the trends?

22:36.520 --> 22:38.000
What regions does this affect?

22:38.000 --> 22:40.760
It affected every single region in the state of California.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.620
It affected every single state in the United States.

22:43.620 --> 22:50.220
So we're not an island in California for this particular issue.

22:50.220 --> 22:56.100
And in fact, by displaying this data and then the next data slide, I think it really provides

22:56.100 --> 23:02.580
a call to action for how we can help districts, how we can show that looking at whether an

23:02.580 --> 23:09.820
absence is excused or unexcused may provide districts and, again, those that are helping

23:09.860 --> 23:17.140
our students advance a more preventative problem-solving and equitable response to poor attendance

23:17.140 --> 23:19.220
practices.

23:19.220 --> 23:21.460
These reports also provide some bright spots.

23:21.460 --> 23:27.620
And while the department doesn't often do that kind of work, we partner with researchers.

23:27.620 --> 23:33.940
We partner with researchers in every major institution in California and mostly are starting

23:33.940 --> 23:38.420
to do more nationally to do these kinds of studies.

23:38.540 --> 23:46.540
So specifically, this report shows the amount of unexcused absences, whether or not the

23:46.540 --> 23:50.700
absence was due to out-of-school suspension or incomplete independent study.

23:50.700 --> 23:58.340
And you can see, again, those shifts in last year, or rather in 2021, having majority of

23:58.340 --> 24:04.420
unexcused absences to a slight shift over to the majority of absences being excused.

24:04.420 --> 24:06.980
So these are, again, important data points.

24:06.980 --> 24:11.540
But the department and the state only gets this after the fact, after a student maybe

24:11.540 --> 24:15.660
has left a school, maybe they've left a district, maybe they've left the state.

24:15.660 --> 24:20.940
And so on a daily basis, local educational agencies have access to students who are not

24:20.940 --> 24:21.940
in the classroom.

24:21.940 --> 24:26.380
And there's an obligation for them to follow up with those particular students and their

24:26.380 --> 24:27.380
families.

24:27.380 --> 24:35.220
And so the superintendent, in releasing the dashboard, along with President Darlene Hammond,

24:35.220 --> 24:42.380
put together a dashboard summary back on December 15 that provided local educational

24:42.380 --> 24:46.820
agencies about information and factors to consider when we go through the reports.

24:46.820 --> 24:51.180
And there was a lot of information in there around the chronic absenteeism concerns and

24:51.180 --> 24:52.460
the high rates.

24:52.460 --> 24:56.980
Again, I talked about that this definitely mirrored national trends.

24:56.980 --> 25:01.180
We are definitely in line with other large states.

25:01.180 --> 25:07.180
And in this summary, which was included, part of it was included as attachment to,

25:07.180 --> 25:13.300
Superintendent Thurman provided guidance and resources on best practices and ways to counter

25:13.300 --> 25:14.300
chronic absenteeism.

25:14.300 --> 25:20.240
He also began a webinar series in January of 2023 that included Aaron Simon from Long

25:20.240 --> 25:25.560
Beach Unified and Sherry Hanny from Butte County Office of Education.

25:25.560 --> 25:30.640
And they really provided a really nice balance of the urban setting versus the rural setting

25:30.840 --> 25:36.600
and strategies that they had are using currently to engage students and try to get students

25:36.600 --> 25:37.600
to school.

25:37.600 --> 25:41.120
Because, of course, if you are chronically absent, you're not getting an opportunity

25:41.120 --> 25:42.120
to learn.

25:42.120 --> 25:48.640
So with that, I wanted to move over to our LEAs and schools that are eligible for support.

25:48.640 --> 25:54.000
Of course, the dashboard, again, while it's meant to be used for giving parents access

25:54.000 --> 25:58.880
to information about how their schools and districts are doing, we also have to use it

25:59.000 --> 26:05.200
as our metric to determine who's not doing well and how they can be provided support,

26:05.200 --> 26:09.320
which are requirements under the Local Control Funding Formula and the Every Student Succeeds

26:09.320 --> 26:12.240
Act.

26:12.240 --> 26:20.400
So for the Local Control Funding Formula, you all adopted the one-time metric using

26:20.400 --> 26:25.640
a status only to determine schools or other districts and county offices of education

26:25.640 --> 26:28.040
that were eligible for differentiated assistance.

26:28.080 --> 26:34.880
2022 saw an absence of looking at charter schools because of previously adopted or previously

26:34.880 --> 26:40.520
signed into law legislation that it excluded them for one additional year.

26:40.520 --> 26:43.760
They will be brought back into the fold in 2023.

26:43.760 --> 26:52.520
So of our over 900 districts, we saw 617 eligible for differentiated assistance.

26:52.520 --> 26:57.720
And the top student groups have been consistent with the exception of the last one.

26:57.720 --> 27:05.640
So for the last 2017, 2018, and 2019, when we previously provided the eligibility for

27:05.640 --> 27:10.960
differentiated assistance, it's always been students with disabilities, homeless and foster

27:10.960 --> 27:15.680
are the student groups that have propelled those districts to be eligible.

27:15.680 --> 27:20.040
The addition this year is English learners, and it's almost 250 districts that are eligible

27:20.040 --> 27:23.200
for English and for their English learner population.

27:23.200 --> 27:28.240
So county offices are now talking to these districts, assisting them.

27:28.240 --> 27:32.120
The California Department of Education is doing the same for county offices who have

27:32.120 --> 27:33.120
been identified.

27:33.120 --> 27:37.400
But this is very significant for the state.

27:37.400 --> 27:45.720
It is a shift from prior years where we've been in the high 300 range for districts eligible

27:45.720 --> 27:48.200
for differentiated assistance.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.600
Of course, this feeds into the Every Student Succeeds Act.

27:52.000 --> 27:57.480
ESSA and the US Department of Education have been very eager to see how the department

27:57.480 --> 28:04.440
and the state board will have implemented for this COVID year, eligibility for comprehensive

28:04.440 --> 28:08.800
support and improvement and additional targeted support and improvement.

28:08.800 --> 28:17.840
And while the adoption of the metric that you all approved for this one year did lower

28:18.320 --> 28:25.360
or did rather yield 333 schools with the low graduation rates, that's under 68 percent

28:25.360 --> 28:32.920
for a three-year average, our CSI low performance at 474, and that's capped, right?

28:32.920 --> 28:38.600
So we have to identify a minimum of 5 percent of schools, so we do our best to hit that

28:38.600 --> 28:42.240
number as closely as possible.

28:42.240 --> 28:47.760
There is no cap or minimum for additional targeted support and improvement, and we have

28:47.760 --> 28:50.960
a record 6,209 schools.

28:50.960 --> 28:56.380
And I can tell you thousands of schools, rather represented by districts, have been reaching

28:56.380 --> 29:00.080
out to us because they are not used to accountability.

29:00.080 --> 29:05.800
They have not been included in prior accountability systems because they are middle or high performing.

29:05.800 --> 29:11.920
And so districts that struggled under the No Child Left Behind criteria and are now

29:11.920 --> 29:16.920
in the Every Student Succeeds Act criteria, this is sort of normal to them, as normal

29:16.960 --> 29:23.960
as possible, but you have a whole new group of schools that have maybe their entire schools

29:24.320 --> 29:26.880
included as ATSI.

29:26.880 --> 29:30.880
And this has been a very difficult release, not only for the department, but I think for

29:30.880 --> 29:36.040
the field, in understanding why are they identified, why is it only one indicator.

29:36.040 --> 29:41.140
And so we talked through the student groups for differentiated assistance.

29:41.140 --> 29:47.860
As the criteria shifts a bit, the student groups under ATSI did as well.

29:47.860 --> 29:53.100
So we see students with disabilities, two or more races, black or African-American,

29:53.100 --> 29:54.540
and our homeless population.

29:54.540 --> 29:57.860
So it is a shift in those metrics.

29:57.860 --> 30:00.620
Of course, for CSI, schools get funding.

30:00.620 --> 30:06.780
There is funding that is provided through Title I, and there is support and plans that

30:06.780 --> 30:13.780
you all are aware of through my colleagues in our Student Achievement and Support Division.

30:14.300 --> 30:19.740
And for ATSI, while there is no money, there is definitely attention and support around

30:19.740 --> 30:23.420
those schools as well.

30:23.420 --> 30:28.860
So last year, well before this summer, I want to say it was your March meeting, maybe it

30:28.860 --> 30:32.380
was even your May meeting, there was this idea of a dashboard toolkit, and I think it

30:32.380 --> 30:36.180
was actually the Association of California School Administrators and maybe the County

30:36.180 --> 30:38.300
Superintendents who suggested it.

30:38.300 --> 30:39.940
And we took it and we ran with it.

30:39.940 --> 30:47.940
And this has provided, I think, it provided a lot of pre-work to the field on this is

30:47.940 --> 30:54.340
what these scores are going to look like, these are how these metrics are determined.

30:54.340 --> 30:57.060
All of that leading up to a release on December 15th.

30:57.060 --> 31:02.540
And I think now that the information is out as far as student outcomes, the toolkit has

31:02.540 --> 31:07.620
become even more valuable and we are still making, we are still adding things to it to

31:07.620 --> 31:12.300
make sure that it is relevant for not only educators, but the public to talk through

31:12.300 --> 31:18.900
what do these outcomes mean and through our system of support, how can we help schools

31:18.900 --> 31:23.900
and districts, you know, help to improve student outcomes moving forward.

31:23.900 --> 31:30.400
So President Darling-Hammond, I just wanted to make sure you did not want me to pause

31:30.440 --> 31:33.440
during this presentation unless...

31:33.440 --> 31:45.440
You are also welcome to breathe when you need to.

31:45.440 --> 31:50.000
Do you want to see if there are any clarifying questions at this juncture?

31:50.000 --> 31:54.560
This has many parts, so I appreciate you offering that.

31:54.560 --> 31:59.240
You've been very clear so far, I don't see any clarifying questions.

31:59.240 --> 32:02.760
Feel free to proceed.

32:02.760 --> 32:03.760
Well maybe just one caveat.

32:03.760 --> 32:10.080
I cannot predict what's going to happen in 2023, but we do continue to read the media

32:10.080 --> 32:15.280
reports and information that schools are sharing with us and districts are sharing with us.

32:15.280 --> 32:19.760
And I did want to acknowledge that I do believe chronic absenteeism is going to continue to

32:19.760 --> 32:20.760
be an issue.

32:20.760 --> 32:25.880
We heard from a rural district in Northern California who said they just hit their 100

32:25.920 --> 32:30.440
day mark and their chronic absenteeism rate for kindergarten is 45%.

32:30.440 --> 32:39.440
So these big issues around attendance, which of course again will impact other student

32:39.440 --> 32:45.120
outcomes, I think will continue to rise to your attention and will continue to be in

32:45.120 --> 32:50.400
the media nationally, absolutely, I've seen it in some of the national publications.

32:50.400 --> 32:55.200
So just for you all to be aware and just to acknowledge that that is a consternation

32:55.200 --> 32:56.200
in the field.

32:56.200 --> 33:01.640
Can I raise a clarifying question about it since you're raising these considerations?

33:01.640 --> 33:06.680
So we do have all of these events that are climate related events that are happening

33:06.680 --> 33:17.340
that will close schools, that will require people to figure out how to move their homes.

33:17.340 --> 33:20.580
How is that treated in the chronic absenteeism?

33:20.580 --> 33:23.820
Yes, so a good question.

33:23.820 --> 33:30.260
So the question around when do we determine if a student, the methodology for chronic

33:30.260 --> 33:36.600
absenteeism, and if a school is open and they expect a student to attend, that's the metric.

33:36.600 --> 33:41.380
So if a school is closed, there is no expectation that those students are expected to attend

33:41.380 --> 33:44.840
and that would not contribute to their chronic absenteeism rate.

33:44.840 --> 33:50.320
That said, I do not handle waivers around the minimum number of school days for the

33:50.320 --> 33:55.580
state, that is my colleagues and other divisions, but in terms of accountability, the metric

33:55.580 --> 34:01.520
is number of days expected to attend over number of days actually attended or vice versa.

34:01.520 --> 34:09.020
If the student's family experienced some aspect of the disaster themselves, that still

34:09.020 --> 34:12.480
would be counted as part of chronic absenteeism if the school was open.

34:12.920 --> 34:19.440
So if a student has been impacted and not been able to attend a school that was open

34:19.440 --> 34:24.200
that they were enrolled at, yes, and if a student has transitioned to a new school and

34:24.200 --> 34:30.760
has not been able to attend school, that would be catalogued as well, that would be documented

34:30.760 --> 34:31.760
as well.

34:31.760 --> 34:36.940
Excused and unexcused absences are counted?

34:36.940 --> 34:40.580
Excused and unexcused absences are counted because the student didn't have an opportunity

34:40.580 --> 34:43.580
to learn regardless of the type of absence.

34:43.580 --> 34:48.340
So I think one of the things that we will want to be considering given the fact that

34:48.340 --> 34:55.660
we're seeing the effects of climate change and of course we're still experiencing the

34:55.660 --> 35:01.220
effects of the pandemic is how do we want to think about that in a way that's productive

35:01.220 --> 35:11.380
for identifying schools and what kind of supports then attend to that because of these

35:11.380 --> 35:14.420
very different rationales.

35:14.420 --> 35:20.300
So calling out the issue that we're going to have to confront.

35:24.300 --> 35:26.300
Just a clarifying question?

35:26.300 --> 35:27.300
Yeah, please.

35:27.380 --> 35:38.620
You shared that report that is average days absent, is that something that's available

35:38.620 --> 35:39.620
on DataQuest?

35:39.620 --> 35:40.620
Absolutely.

35:40.620 --> 35:46.100
So we released this, actually it was one of the newest reports when Superintendent Thurman

35:46.100 --> 35:50.300
first took office in October that year, was that 2019?

35:50.300 --> 35:54.260
I can't even remember, 2019.

35:55.220 --> 36:00.220
It actually came out of the foster youth community.

36:00.220 --> 36:08.340
The foster youth community has really spent a lot of time and focus to make sure that

36:08.340 --> 36:14.340
our students who need to be at school and are most vulnerable students are receiving

36:14.340 --> 36:15.340
that opportunity.

36:15.340 --> 36:20.740
So this has been on DataQuest now for several years and it is available as a downloadable

36:20.740 --> 36:21.740
file.

36:22.220 --> 36:26.380
We do have researchers that are using it through the downloadable file and I know that there's

36:26.380 --> 36:30.420
a publication pending on this very report.

36:30.420 --> 36:31.420
At the school level?

36:31.420 --> 36:37.580
At the school level, it's at the district, it's at the county, it's at the state.

36:37.580 --> 36:40.380
And you can filter, I know you're interested in charter schools, you can filter by charter

36:40.380 --> 36:45.380
schools or non-charter schools and so there is lots of opportunities to look at the data.

36:46.020 --> 36:52.540
Okay, so let's shift over to 2023, present day.

36:52.540 --> 36:59.700
We have been waiting for this to come because some of these projects have been on hold since

36:59.700 --> 37:00.700
COVID happened.

37:00.700 --> 37:07.780
And so we had fully intended to have a full-blown English under progress indicator and other

37:07.780 --> 37:14.100
metrics collected for college career and the pandemic really put this work on hold.

37:14.820 --> 37:19.500
What you're going to see today is looking back at things that we've been wanting to

37:19.500 --> 37:23.740
work on that we'll finally get to in 2023.

37:23.740 --> 37:29.500
Last fall, you all adopted 11 dashboard principles and I'm happy to share with you that information.

37:29.500 --> 37:35.660
We just recently added it to our webpages so you can find it on our website and those

37:35.660 --> 37:39.660
were designed to serve as an anchor for your decisions moving forward.

37:40.220 --> 37:47.780
So in the item we did reference which dashboard principles each individually were relevant

37:47.780 --> 37:51.060
to and I'm not going to go through these because you spent so much time on them last

37:51.060 --> 37:56.740
year but they are in the slide deck in case we need to refer back to them.

37:56.740 --> 38:03.140
So as with all of our work plans that we've brought before the board each March, we are

38:03.140 --> 38:08.980
still focused on continuous improvement that has been a tenet of the system and the dashboard.

38:08.980 --> 38:14.220
And so our plans look not only at the state and local indicators, you are going to hear

38:14.220 --> 38:19.260
your next item is all about a local indicator that of course is not in our work plan because

38:19.260 --> 38:25.020
the timing was off but this is your opportunity again to suggest revisions or updates for

38:25.020 --> 38:26.020
the plan.

38:26.020 --> 38:29.620
This plan has been reviewed not only by the California Petitions Advisory Group which

38:29.620 --> 38:32.860
you're going to hear about towards the end of the presentation but we have taken it to

38:32.860 --> 38:34.780
multiple partners early.

38:34.780 --> 38:39.940
We took it to the equity groups back in October, we've taken it to the County Superintendents

38:39.940 --> 38:47.780
Association for their curriculum subgroups and their assessment subgroups and so we have

38:47.780 --> 38:54.820
tried to actually be proactive well beyond you all seeing this today.

38:54.820 --> 38:58.940
So what's at hand today and we're going to walk through is our English Learner Progress

38:58.940 --> 39:04.140
Indicator, the completion of it, our updates to state indicators for graduation rate, college

39:04.140 --> 39:10.420
career and then looking at our priority one teacher assignment data and additional data

39:10.420 --> 39:16.500
on the dashboard in lieu of us having enough data to add things to the dashboard.

39:16.500 --> 39:22.160
And so we will also talk a little bit about the growth model and some updated business

39:22.160 --> 39:26.060
rules we're going to ask you to weigh in on this fall.

39:26.060 --> 39:33.420
So let's start with the English Learner Progress Indicator and talk through the components

39:33.500 --> 39:39.300
of not only this indicator but how this is what we do for each indicator.

39:39.300 --> 39:45.820
So we of course for every state indicator on the dashboard we have a status methodology,

39:45.820 --> 39:51.080
we have status levels and cut scores which include five levels of only for current year

39:51.080 --> 39:58.640
performance from very high to very low, we have the five levels of change again looking

39:58.640 --> 40:04.520
at from increase significantly to decrease significantly and then our five by five color

40:04.520 --> 40:10.560
grid and so this is really I think the first time for many of you to weigh in on a conversation

40:10.560 --> 40:15.840
around cut scores and so forgive me if I'm taking this a little slow but I think it's

40:15.840 --> 40:22.320
an opportunity for us also to help the members of the public understand the process as well.

40:22.320 --> 40:28.800
So the English Learner Progress Indicator was reported on the first dashboard in 2017

40:28.800 --> 40:31.960
and we had a color back then.

40:31.960 --> 40:39.880
In 2018 the board approved a three-year plan to shift because of course we changed assessments

40:39.880 --> 40:49.320
for this indicator and so we were gearing up for creating status for the LP in 2018.

40:49.320 --> 40:56.320
In 2019 the board approved the methodology to create six English Learner Progress levels

40:56.320 --> 41:03.720
based on the LPAC, the English Learner Proficiency Assessment for California and the cut scores

41:03.720 --> 41:11.200
for this indicator and we had really hanging over us because of a waiver that the U.S.

41:11.200 --> 41:17.920
Department of Education denied after arguing in person and going to great lengths during

41:17.920 --> 41:19.160
that process.

41:19.160 --> 41:23.600
The original LP actually had long-term English learners in it and the U.S. Department of

41:23.600 --> 41:30.320
Education did not find that to be in compliance with the federal statute and so part of the

41:30.320 --> 41:35.440
reason that you see the second bullet here that I wanted to point out is we had an obligation

41:35.440 --> 41:39.800
from the U.S. Department of Education to make sure that we were still using this indicator

41:39.800 --> 41:46.520
even though we just had status only for making determinations for schools eligible for assistance.

41:46.520 --> 41:50.600
So this was important because when the U.S. Department of Education sends you a letter

41:50.600 --> 41:55.360
saying your grant is at risk you better pay attention and so that's what the board made

41:55.360 --> 41:59.840
it just you know we brought options to you and that's what was used.

41:59.840 --> 42:08.120
So you did see schools being determined eligible based on specifically on just that status

42:08.120 --> 42:09.120
information.

42:09.120 --> 42:12.600
Now it seems sort of normal because we did a whole dashboard just based only on status

42:12.600 --> 42:14.720
in 2022.

42:14.720 --> 42:18.880
So for 2020 and 2021 dashboards of course everything was suspended and you didn't see

42:18.880 --> 42:28.120
data on the dashboard due to Senate Bill 98 and Assembly Bill 130 because of the pandemic.

42:28.120 --> 42:35.600
So again components that were approved prior for the English Learner Progress Indicator

42:35.600 --> 42:42.280
were the status methodologies adopted in 2019 and again the status is measuring the rate

42:42.320 --> 42:46.480
of English learners who are moving towards English language proficiency.

42:46.480 --> 42:49.160
That is the whole purpose of this indicator.

42:49.160 --> 42:53.400
There is one student group in this indicator English learners not long term English learners

42:53.400 --> 42:59.880
just current English learners and so the status cut scores that were approved in 2019 have

42:59.880 --> 43:06.440
the five levels of the current year performance from very high to very low and of course this

43:07.400 --> 43:14.320
in keeping with your dashboard priority five which talks about having the five levels based

43:14.320 --> 43:20.840
on percentile distributions on actual based on actual district and school performance

43:20.840 --> 43:25.320
to create the five by five grid.

43:25.320 --> 43:31.080
So for 2023 we are looking to finally bring the English Learner Progress Indicator back

43:31.080 --> 43:32.840
on the dashboard with color.

43:32.840 --> 43:41.240
And so we will our plan to you is to evaluate the data look at the data and reestablish

43:41.240 --> 43:47.160
that grid and make sure that we're incorporating for the first time students who take alternate

43:47.160 --> 43:55.120
English Learner the proficiency assessment again for our most severely cognitive disabled

43:55.120 --> 44:02.120
students that that one percent that it that test was not around back in 2017 and so we

44:02.120 --> 44:07.760
are really excited to be able to bring that population of students into this measure.

44:07.760 --> 44:14.760
So as far as LP change we are looking at again measuring the year to year rate of that change.

44:15.360 --> 44:20.840
We need to have three years of data so we are finally in 2023 capturing that third year

44:20.840 --> 44:26.800
of summative assessments for the LPAC and then we are going to be analyzing that those

44:26.800 --> 44:32.040
multiple years of data to determine the change or place the change cut scores based on the

44:32.040 --> 44:36.760
methodologies that you've provided in the past or adopted in the past.

44:36.760 --> 44:43.760
We have a standard group of stakeholders that we look to for policy considerations technical

44:45.680 --> 44:49.800
considerations and then under the Ever Student Succeeds Act we have to take it to the California

44:49.800 --> 44:54.000
Practitioners Advisory Group because they're your committee of practitioners.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.720
That is not the only groups that we talked to and so I know we're going to talk about

44:57.720 --> 45:01.920
this at the very end but we are going to the CABE conference at the end of this month.

45:01.920 --> 45:06.000
We talked to the regional assessment network we talked to CISC the county superintendents

45:06.000 --> 45:09.720
we go to the bilingual coordinators network and then anybody who wants to invite us to

45:09.720 --> 45:15.920
a meeting to talk about accountability we pretty much show up so I would just say you

45:15.920 --> 45:21.560
know this is not limited we've had a lot of conversations around this and English

45:21.560 --> 45:25.400
learners as you can see is at the core of the students that we need to serve because

45:25.400 --> 45:30.080
we see them identified through differentiated assistance this year at numbers that we're

45:30.080 --> 45:33.000
not used to seeing.

45:33.000 --> 45:39.760
So in terms of the 5x5 color grid again we need to we're calling it reestablished because

45:39.760 --> 45:45.640
you had already adopted and our state plan actually includes a 5x5 color grid under the

45:45.640 --> 45:48.320
Every Student Succeeds Act for this indicator.

45:48.320 --> 45:52.920
We are looking at those multiple years of the LPAC summative and so we are also going

45:52.920 --> 45:59.800
to be looking at past and current LP data to I think this is a duplicate slide to produce

45:59.800 --> 46:00.800
the colors.

46:00.800 --> 46:06.980
So in terms of the alt LPAC and the LP again we've traditionally we've not had access

46:06.980 --> 46:11.400
to these test scores so for the first time we have access to the information this is

46:11.400 --> 46:17.800
an assessment that you adopted back in 2019 and so we are able to look at the two years

46:17.800 --> 46:27.280
of summative from well we had the field test in 2021 the operational is this year.

46:27.280 --> 46:34.160
So as far as plans for looking at these data we need to review the data from the assessments

46:34.160 --> 46:39.740
results from 2022 and we are in the process of doing that currently and so reviewing that

46:39.780 --> 46:44.700
information again with the workgroups we've already talked about and then with the availability

46:44.700 --> 46:50.500
again of those the second year of data we can incorporate it into the calculation of

46:50.500 --> 46:56.660
the LP status at least for the 2023 dashboard so again really fully making sure that every

46:56.660 --> 47:01.860
student is included that has the opportunity to be included.

47:01.860 --> 47:07.300
This topic has received a lot of attention not only from previous board meetings but

47:07.340 --> 47:12.660
the current board meeting and so I just wanted to address some of the concerns directly about

47:12.660 --> 47:17.860
the request to revisit the status cut scores which is not currently on our work plan.

47:17.860 --> 47:22.140
So we did hear from the California Britishers advisory group and the letters from the field

47:22.140 --> 47:27.020
have said asking some of them have asked for a reset of the status cut scores that were

47:27.020 --> 47:34.780
adopted back in 2019 and the really one of the arguments that keeps being brought up

47:34.860 --> 47:38.940
is that this is based on the amount of school districts that are in the very low and of

47:38.940 --> 47:42.940
course there's not a predetermined number of districts or schools that need to be in

47:42.940 --> 47:47.140
the very low there is no minimums especially when you get to differentiated assistance

47:47.140 --> 47:51.740
there is no minimum number of school districts that need to be or local educational agencies

47:51.740 --> 47:56.180
that need to be eligible for differentiated assistance that's not how the methodology

47:56.180 --> 48:00.300
that was adopted by the board works but I wanted to make sure that we walked through

48:00.300 --> 48:06.220
some of these considerations. So the concerns also talked about that the significance of

48:06.220 --> 48:10.700
this indicator would be diminished and give districts a false impression as to how other

48:10.700 --> 48:15.900
students have progressed in learning English. The other piece that we saw and we've heard

48:15.900 --> 48:22.900
this in a couple of different ways is that the performance expectations to align they're

48:22.900 --> 48:26.300
asking for the performance expectations to align with what we know from research and

48:26.300 --> 48:30.180
not based on a normative distribution of our school systems under performance in this

48:30.180 --> 48:35.060
area and those comments really remind me of the no child left behind era where you were

48:35.060 --> 48:41.380
looking to hit a certain bar for students and instead what the board has adopted again

48:41.380 --> 48:47.460
is percentile distributions based on actual district and school performance so that you

48:47.460 --> 48:53.580
can see achievable progress for our students especially in that middle set that's where

48:53.620 --> 48:58.700
a lot of that is concentrated and then also see some schools or districts in the very

48:58.700 --> 49:05.700
high or the very high status and so just as a you know going back to our July meeting

49:06.900 --> 49:12.580
we talked a little bit about how we created or the methodology that we've used to create

49:12.580 --> 49:17.540
the status levels for every single indicator. This is not different for any of the indicators

49:17.540 --> 49:23.180
that you have on the dashboard today whether it's graduation rate or academic performance

49:23.180 --> 49:28.300
indicator suspension college career indicator so we look at the results for all LEAs and

49:28.300 --> 49:33.900
charters again based on student level data we order those results from highest to lowest

49:33.900 --> 49:39.700
and then we look at four cut points established based on percentile distribution so we look

49:39.700 --> 49:46.460
at a very low status point set on a small percent at the lowest end of their distribution

49:46.540 --> 49:53.540
usually under ten percent and again this performance level is equivalent to an unacceptable performance

49:53.700 --> 50:00.700
level and may likely result in intensive or focused support. The high we were looking

50:01.620 --> 50:06.580
at for each of our indicators meaning that every student succeeds act requirement for

50:06.580 --> 50:13.580
states to set ambitious goals so this is again in line with we're looking at LEAs to obtain

50:14.500 --> 50:20.660
this this ranking for each of the state indicators that's the aspirational goal and the remaining

50:20.660 --> 50:27.660
cut points were established again based on this percentile distribution. So in terms

50:28.260 --> 50:34.460
of looking at the status cut scores and the history of resetting them for other indicators

50:34.460 --> 50:41.260
in 2018 the state board did look at status cut scores for academic indicators so for

50:41.260 --> 50:47.100
mathematics and English language arts because there was a change in the distribution that

50:47.100 --> 50:54.100
year so due to the change in distribution of status and so the board did adopt adjusting

50:54.500 --> 51:00.040
those cut scores. We see in 2022 that the distribution for this particular indicator

51:00.040 --> 51:05.280
is similar to that distribution that you adopted back in 2019 so we are not seeing the large

51:05.280 --> 51:09.780
changes that could be made to the cut scores and there's no large changes in the overall

51:09.820 --> 51:14.820
distribution so this is the reason that we have not brought this back to you for reopening

51:14.820 --> 51:18.140
otherwise we would have you know looking at the data and we've again spent a lot of

51:18.140 --> 51:24.060
time talking about this indicator in prior meetings we would have brought it to you and

51:24.060 --> 51:30.660
so just a quick revisiting of what the current status levels are for this indicator at the

51:30.660 --> 51:36.060
very high we're looking at 65 percent students are more making progress towards English language

51:36.180 --> 51:43.180
proficiency and at the very low end it's 34.9 percent or less and of course if we were

51:46.940 --> 51:50.580
to honor the request from the California Patricia Jones advisory group or those that have advocated

51:50.580 --> 51:55.740
for this change you would you know we're looking back at the principles for each of

51:55.740 --> 52:00.900
the other indicators and it would mean moving towards a criterion referenced cut scores

52:00.900 --> 52:05.980
as opposed to percentile distribution and again that would require that it be sent on

52:05.980 --> 52:12.340
a predetermined performance level that you all would get to determine so percentile distribution

52:12.340 --> 52:19.340
allows you to work off of actual data and that's how those distributions were made.

52:23.060 --> 52:27.460
I'm going to step down and I'm going to have my colleague come up unless you wanted

52:27.460 --> 52:29.580
to pause for clarifying questions.

52:29.580 --> 52:36.580
Are there any clarifying questions on that? Kim you look like you want to ask a question.

52:40.500 --> 52:44.500
I can see the furrow in your brow.

52:44.500 --> 52:51.500
In terms of understanding the distribution across the five the current cohort of folks

52:51.700 --> 52:58.700
or districts that are identified for in the lowest represents about is it about 20 percent

53:00.300 --> 53:05.180
or is it higher than that? I'm just wondering if it actually tracks to a roughly proportional

53:05.180 --> 53:09.180
distribution across the five.

53:09.180 --> 53:15.180
I realize in looking at some of the documents and Kimberly gets here to help with some of

53:15.180 --> 53:22.180
the more technical questions is that we in some of our documents we did not show at least

53:23.180 --> 53:28.140
at a state level the distribution including charter schools so when we think about differentiated

53:28.140 --> 53:32.700
assistance this year we didn't have charter schools in the mix and when you include charter

53:32.700 --> 53:37.860
schools and when you originally adopted the status cut scores back in 2019 they actually

53:37.860 --> 53:44.060
make up a bulk of what is considered on the very low piece so when we think about the

53:44.140 --> 53:50.340
distribution being a little bit under 10 percent for very low it's made up not only of not

53:50.340 --> 53:57.340
only our traditional districts and county offices but charter schools and so that piece

53:57.420 --> 54:01.980
is missing from deliberately missing from differentiated assistance this year because

54:01.980 --> 54:06.980
we were prohibited from thinking about including charter schools in the mix so it is when we

54:06.980 --> 54:12.380
look at it it is it does come up to similar numbers but because again differentiated assistance

54:12.460 --> 54:18.740
this year was only for traditional districts you don't see that in our document in our

54:18.740 --> 54:21.740
in our memo to you all from December.

54:21.740 --> 54:27.860
Thanks and I'm just going to remind all the board members to pull your microphone close

54:27.860 --> 54:34.860
and be sure you turn it on when you are speaking and Vice President Glover Woods.

54:35.260 --> 54:42.260
Cindy just to clarify the districts that will be eligible based upon the 2023 budget and

54:42.380 --> 54:49.380
the dash board the LP data we will be looking at will be based on the performance grid now

54:50.300 --> 54:57.300
that we have status and change cut scores as opposed to when we did not have change

54:57.300 --> 54:58.660
cut scores is that correct?

54:58.660 --> 55:03.300
That's correct we'll bring in we'll bring in change cut scores this year and we'll

55:03.300 --> 55:07.180
bring in of course charter schools to the fold for differentiated assistance.

55:07.180 --> 55:09.540
Okay thank you for that clarification.

55:10.540 --> 55:12.540
All right let's move on ahead.

55:16.540 --> 55:21.100
Thank you everybody so I have my timer I'm not going to try I'm going to slow things

55:21.100 --> 55:25.420
down a little bit but you guys have a lot of the rest of this plan in the item so I

55:25.420 --> 55:28.260
do want to let you know that there are brief slides on everything here but if there are

55:28.260 --> 55:32.940
additional questions at the end I'm more than happy to go through all of them.

55:32.940 --> 55:36.660
So nice to see everybody in person and see your faces as well and I'm going to try not

55:36.660 --> 55:39.980
to fog up my glasses today.

55:39.980 --> 55:46.740
So the graduation rate indicator is also very familiar to you because we have been dealing

55:46.740 --> 55:52.700
with some bumps in the road around the graduation rate indicator specifically in the last year.

55:52.700 --> 55:57.500
So since 2017 with the adoption of the dashboard the graduation rate indicator calculation

55:57.500 --> 56:03.760
has really varied each year for both traditional non-DAS schools and for DAS schools.

56:03.760 --> 56:08.400
So originally we had a four-year cohort rate across the entire dashboard for all of our

56:08.400 --> 56:12.720
schools that were on the dashboard actually you know I think I'm going to have to do this

56:12.720 --> 56:18.340
I apologize it's not going to work that way and then the four and five-year combination

56:18.340 --> 56:24.480
rate came into play in the 2018 dashboard for all of our traditional schools and then

56:24.480 --> 56:30.400
the one-year graduation rate in 2019 debuted for our DAS schools as a modified method that

56:30.400 --> 56:36.120
we're able to include and then we had merges of a four-five-one-year rate in 2019 as well

56:36.120 --> 56:37.580
for our LEAs.

56:37.580 --> 56:43.440
So we have seen a cavalcade of methodologies for actually measuring how students are graduating

56:43.440 --> 56:47.620
and matriculating at our schools on the dashboard.

56:47.620 --> 56:53.320
Now as we remember back in 2022 in July we had submitted a waiver which took a lot of

56:53.320 --> 57:00.240
time in last March at this meeting to request that we could continue to use modified methods

57:00.640 --> 57:05.000
for calculating the academic and graduation rate indicators for our DAS schools.

57:05.000 --> 57:10.880
Unfortunately ED did not agree with that waiver and specifically requested that it did not

57:10.880 --> 57:16.200
sufficiently demonstrate how the request would advance student academic achievement.

57:16.200 --> 57:22.560
So unfortunately we were left with the inability to apply that one-year DAS rate methodology

57:22.560 --> 57:28.080
to our DAS schools and to merge that into our LEA rates as well.

57:28.080 --> 57:33.320
So with this shift in federal accountability for DAS schools you approved a recommendation

57:33.320 --> 57:37.400
for us to work on developing long-term options to support these schools.

57:37.400 --> 57:42.660
So we're happy today to be here to present some of those options to you and specifically

57:42.660 --> 57:47.000
we were going to review the options presented in the letter which was very kind of them

57:47.000 --> 57:52.480
to offer some suggestions and asked that they specifically stated that we could propose

57:52.480 --> 57:57.800
to incorporate multiple extended year adjusted cohort graduation rates to give credit to

57:57.800 --> 58:02.920
schools and students that are receiving a regular graduate high school diploma in six

58:02.920 --> 58:05.040
or more years hint hint.

58:05.040 --> 58:14.200
So we wanted to enable in this last system cycle as Cindy just displayed to you to utilize

58:14.200 --> 58:20.360
any sort of one-year or modified rate for DAS schools for federal identification purposes

58:20.360 --> 58:25.480
and specifically under comprehensive support we have to identify schools that have the

58:25.480 --> 58:31.240
lowest graduation rate in our state under CSI graduation rate identification.

58:31.240 --> 58:36.640
And so we knew collectively that changing that graduation rate methodology was likely

58:36.640 --> 58:40.760
going to impact the number of schools that were identified for support.

58:40.760 --> 58:44.740
And so I want to show you exactly what that did over the time.

58:44.740 --> 58:50.880
So in the 2020-21 school year we saw 236 DAS schools identified utilizing our modified

58:50.880 --> 58:55.960
methods even for graduation rate on the dashboard.

58:55.960 --> 59:05.500
In 2021-22 that was 151 schools but this year for 2022-23 support we see 293 DAS schools

59:05.500 --> 59:11.720
collected within our CSI low graduation rate identification process which is a significant

59:11.720 --> 59:17.640
number of them and obviously is measuring for some schools and some schools students

59:17.640 --> 59:22.280
that had a long past their fifth year of eligibility right we're grabbing students

59:22.280 --> 59:27.640
that they can't even capture in a graduation rate at those schools.

59:27.640 --> 59:32.880
So therefore our work plan for 2023 is that CDE plans to review and analyze data with

59:32.880 --> 59:38.340
our educational partners and workgroups to identify options and methodologies to calculate

59:38.340 --> 59:44.800
a multiple extended year rate and to look at how specifically this multiple extended

59:44.800 --> 59:48.040
year rate would affect DAS schools.

59:48.040 --> 59:53.040
And while we know that this multiple extended year rate will apply to all schools right

59:53.040 --> 59:56.080
well we're going to have to if we develop something and we want to apply it to DAS

59:56.080 --> 59:58.640
schools it has to apply to all of them.

59:58.640 --> 01:00:04.600
The intended outcome really that we're looking for is an advantageous rate for DAS schools.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:10.680
We're not looking to layer on additional complexity if we're not seeing right an advantageous

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:15.840
result for these schools in that way and in turn we might want to look at other methodologies

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:19.360
and see what we're going through so that's what we're going to be devoting our work

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:24.240
to within the graduation rate this year.

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:30.040
Next up on the docket the college career indicator and as Cindy pointed out on our summary the

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:34.560
CCI wasn't published in the 2021 statewide summative because of the summative assessments

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:37.080
in 2021.

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:41.880
We had flexibility and therefore as those summative assessment results are an integral

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:50.200
part of the CCI we did not report on any status for the 2022 dashboard.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:57.080
However we will be releasing shortly this spring the results of how LEAs in schools

01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:03.440
did perform on the metrics within the CCI so look forward to that in our school dashboard

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:07.400
additional reports coming soon.

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:13.600
Now in the 2023 dashboard CCI will come back and we've already developed some lovely cell

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:19.600
phone bar graphics so it can have a status only for 2023 and then change or performance

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:24.680
levels will not be reported for the CCI so it's still going to stand alone as its own

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:31.640
special indicator on the 2023 dashboard however in 2024 it will return with status change

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:37.480
and performance levels similar to those reported in 2019.

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:44.040
Now specifically for 2023 we have a lot of work ahead on the plate and as Cindy mentioned

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:51.520
essentially this is the stagnated back loaded workload that we were unable to work on for

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:53.000
the past couple of years.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.960
So specifically we're looking at analyzing and validating data for four new career measures.

01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:02.880
Those are internships, student led enterprise, simulated work based learning and the Armed

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:08.960
Services Vocational Aptitude Battery as FAB armed forces qualification scores.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:16.240
Those are all career based measures that the board had actually asked us to look into and

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:22.880
had walked through in the 2020 meeting in March to look forward and explore options

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:24.920
of inclusion in the CCI.

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:31.400
Unfortunately over the past couple of years in collecting data on these indicators options

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:37.880
for students to engage in career level participation at a high school have as we kind of know been

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:38.880
limited.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:42.880
So our data collection in this way has been limited over the past few years so we're hoping

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:47.920
that this year the collection is even more robust and the cumulative information that

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:53.200
we have over the past few years can assist us in figuring out if that is something that

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:56.000
the board wants to incorporate into the CCI.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:02.280
So we will look to see whether or not that these are valid for inclusion with all of

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:08.960
our partners as well as what would be prepared or approaching prepared criteria and present

01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:12.960
that to you in September for a decision.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:18.780
Additionally over the past few years we want to explore some modifications to the currently

01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:21.740
CCI measures.

01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:26.820
Specifically looking at the expansion of work based learning activities in schools and also

01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:32.220
the impact of implementing work based learnings during the COVID-19 pandemic and what schools

01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:34.320
are currently available to offer.

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:38.800
So there was a lot of fluctuation and change which was going on with work based learning

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:43.300
over the past few years and we want to make sure that we update that and subject to our

01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:48.620
continuous improvement goals and responsibilities within the CCI and make sure that our terminology

01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:54.780
and what we're asking for from all of our schools and districts matches what we're looking

01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:55.860
to see.

01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:59.660
And then finally we also want to establish some data collection guidelines for two new

01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:06.860
CCI measures specifically civic engagement and also for industry certifications.

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:13.740
At this time we do not collect any information formally within a formal data collection as

01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:16.320
we do from LEAs on civic engagement.

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:23.320
We have you know some kind of you know seal reportings and such of counts and who's requesting

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:28.400
things but we don't have any student level data that we would need to be able to fold

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:35.240
that in to the CCI and or evaluate measure validity across student groups, participation

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:39.320
right schools and LEAs all of the work that we do for validity and reliability.

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:43.980
We don't have that yet so we would look at how we would get that and additionally same

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:51.360
with industry certifications the process that we would go through to do that.

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:56.740
Then we also have outside of our indicators some additional data on the dashboard and

01:04:56.740 --> 01:05:01.460
specifically over the past few years we've been asked to add additional information to

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:07.020
the dashboard based both on requirements from statute as well as prior state board action.

01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:12.500
So from statute we have a requirement to add least restrictive environment data as well

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:17.000
as teacher assignment data under priority one and then from prior board action in your

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:23.640
requests we have a request to add science data to the dashboard as well as information

01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:26.060
on student growth.

01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:29.780
So first up least restrictive environment.

01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:35.780
So we have a request on or before November 30th of this year to publish data related

01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:41.440
to federal measures of least restrictive environment for pupils with disabilities on the web on

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:47.000
our website and included as a resource for the dashboard and that information needs to

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.200
be disaggregated by race, ethnicity and LEA so we will be looking at the best options

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:58.460
for this and be presenting those options for you for approval in September.

01:05:58.460 --> 01:06:02.040
As far as priority one teacher assignment data is concerned this is another priority

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:06.040
that you have been a part of and folding into.

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:11.180
For the 2022 local indicator resources we just want to point out that we do as Cindy

01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:18.220
talked about our tool kit have multiple resources available to parents and educators around

01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:21.340
how things work and the purpose of things on the dashboard.

01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:25.980
So we specifically have a flyer entitled information on local indicators for parents it's on our

01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:32.420
dashboard tool kit and additionally our other offices have a self reflection tool document

01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:36.020
available on the local indicator web page and we wanted to link those resources here

01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:40.160
for you to have access to.

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:45.320
As we can remember senate bill 75 requires that the standards for local indicators on

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:49.280
which the department collects or otherwise has access to relevant reliable school data

01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:55.920
for all schools statewide shall to the extent practicable be based on objective criteria

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:59.600
and they may include but are not necessarily limited to the extent of disparities across

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:04.200
school sites within a school district county office of education or performance relative

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.840
to statewide data.

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:12.240
So specifically we are going to be developing objective criteria for reporting the teacher

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:18.640
component of priority one this year and we've spoken to how this work has already started

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:22.440
with a work group the formation of a work group who's already met once and will meet

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:27.560
again once the release of the second year of teacher data is available that has not

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:32.280
been published or made available yet so when that is out we will be able to evaluate that

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:36.360
developing that objective criteria.

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:40.640
Additionally will be gathering feedback for reporting the information and additional resources

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:44.480
that we need to develop for the two thousand twenty three dashboard in order to communicate

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:51.840
this information clearly to the public and to all of our constituents.

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:57.560
Science data on the dashboard so first off let's just remember that the first operational

01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:02.920
test of our cast our California science test was in twenty eighteen and then obviously

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:07.080
we had some little interruptions going through but at the March state board meeting when

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:10.880
none of us thought anything was going to be you know bumps or bruises coming ahead in

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:15.400
twenty twenty this was the first time we talked about incorporating science on the dashboard

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:21.440
formally and then in two thousand twenty two last March we had an update specifically to

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:26.280
you about the feasibility and timeline of incorporating science data on the dashboard

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:32.320
and walked through that and in September you approved adding a link to our on the dashboard

01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:37.400
for additional reports page specifically to the science data and that is available right

01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:41.480
now and live on the dashboard.

01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:45.640
This prior year's assessments in two thousand one twenty one twenty two was the first year

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:50.280
that we had a significant proportion of eligible students take the cast so we had ninety one

01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:55.360
point eight percent of eligible students take the cast that year as well as seventy

01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:59.680
two point eight percent of eligible students taking our alternative assessment for science

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:03.960
which is also important right for us to look at and incorporate into the overall results

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:06.000
as well.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:12.880
So therefore this year our work plan includes continuing the process of providing the link

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:19.880
on for each school and lea through our additional reports website and we have a flyer in fact

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:24.680
helping people identify where that information is and then in late two thousand twenty three

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:30.360
twenty four when we are in receipt of another additional year of data and will evaluate

01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:35.320
the inclusion of science into the dashboard so we will you know that information will

01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:40.560
come through and our ability to engage in that information will I promise begin right

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:47.560
after we get that data in and move forward late this fall and then finally an update

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.840
on a student level growth model.

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:55.280
This process began in January twenty seventeen when the state board discussed the initial

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:59.880
criteria for selecting a student level growth model to be used for school and district level

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:04.840
accountability and if my memory serves pretty much every state board meeting after that

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:10.200
and both some update on the growth model moving forward until we reached May twenty eighteen

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:15.000
when the state board directed the CDE specifically to explore residual gain models for possible

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:21.840
inclusion in the dashboard and right after that we took a small pause in developing things.

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:25.680
We came back in May of two thousand twenty one and approved the empirical best linear

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:31.680
prediction the EBLIP model weighted average methodology for measuring student growth and

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:38.080
that fall we were able to release all of our the data that we use to evaluate and adopt

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:43.760
the EBLIP for use and so we released that historical data from two thousand seventeen

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:49.560
to two thousand nineteen for folks to preview and get a sense of what growth data would

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:55.520
look like when in two thousand twenty four we are able to release that data again.

01:10:55.520 --> 01:11:02.080
So the first official set of student level growth data will be released in the fall of

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:06.560
two thousand twenty four utilizing the two thousand twenty one twenty two twenty two

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:10.400
twenty three and twenty three twenty four data.

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:16.160
The weighted average and the necessity for using a weighted average if anybody needs

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:20.080
a refresher on that I would go back to the May twenty twenty one meeting to walk through

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:25.680
how we really need those three years in order to provide valid and reliable results for

01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:30.360
student level growth model so therefore just that's the first time we can do it is in

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:33.000
fall of twenty twenty four.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:38.160
However that doesn't mean that we can't do anything this year and therefore we are working

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:43.600
as we speak on soliciting feedback from focus groups educational partners as well as you

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:50.720
this year on the best approach on how to display growth data to various audiences and specifically

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:57.200
we are looking at parents or looking through and speaking to parents or looking to speak

01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:03.600
to more invested researchers right a little bit you know LEA users and such and get all

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:09.600
of the perspective that they can share on the best way for us to access and display

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:14.600
information in a clear and cohesive way because if this information is going to be accessible

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:19.560
through the dashboard in some way we feel that onus and responsibility that it is clear

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:22.880
and it makes sense to everyone that's engaging with it we don't want to add any additional

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:27.080
confusion and as you know from the dashboard right we are looking for a clear and cohesive

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:34.400
way to be able to share that information with all of our parents and educational stakeholders.

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:38.720
Now finally this is the last point before I bring Cindy back up is our work plan for

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:44.520
addressing data quality issues and this has been you know something that Cindy spoke to

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:48.560
earlier about our chronic absenteeism data right things coming through in the bumps and

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:52.360
bruises that we have in data collection in those early years.

01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:57.280
So this year we are looking to specifically explore the alignment of implications for

01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:02.440
both schools and LEAs that fail to certify their data in our California Longitudinal

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:09.640
Pupil Achievement Data System or CALPADS or if they identify issues in their data submission

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:15.360
following that submission and report to the CDE that that data is incorrect.

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:20.240
This year we have had many instances of that occurring and happening and we are looking

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:28.000
for some direction on how we would like to universally handle and work with the implications

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:34.560
of what that means in either not submitting data in a timely way or any data in the system

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:38.000
or identifying that it's incorrect after the fact.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:44.720
So we're also going to in trying to align all of the indicators on the dashboard review

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:50.800
our participation rate penalty for the LPAC and provide suggestions and alignment for

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:57.800
the participation rate and how it's incorporated into the LP specifically in alignment with

01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:02.320
how we currently measure participation on our English language arts and math indicators.

01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:07.600
So we would like to have some consistency across all our indicators and expectations

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:13.840
for participation on our assessments and we would like to align that participation rate

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:17.920
so we'll be looking with our workgroups and working with our educational partners to see

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:22.720
how best to do that and with that I will invite Cindy back up to close this out.

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:32.160
Thanks Kim and I think Kim failed to mention that she is a manager in our division.

01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:37.040
She is the manager of the Accountability Development and Policy Analysis Unit.

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:43.600
She has a colleague Ryan Lamb who is responsible for measurement and technical analysis

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:48.160
and those two together produce the dashboard so we have a fantastic team

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:53.680
at the department that the administration has consistently supported with more positions and

01:14:53.680 --> 01:15:00.400
funding when asked for to put out what you see today to respond to again numerous questions

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:05.120
from not only the public but our local educational agencies to support them with these efforts.

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:10.000
So just to close out the California Petitioners Advisory Group is your title one committee of

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.280
practitioners which is required under the Every Student Succeeds Act.

01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:19.920
They meet a couple of times a year and we always take first to them anything we're going to take

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:26.080
to you and we get their feedback. So member Glover Woods is your representative or liaison to that

01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:32.240
group and she participated in the meeting last month but specifically just wanted to briefly

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:39.520
give you their feedback. They do not vote on anything they simply have a lot of ideas about

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:46.160
how we can do things differently or suggestions for improvement. So they did discuss the revisiting

01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:52.400
of the cut scores for the English Learner Progress Indicator and again looking at actually

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:58.800
splitting the cut scores into the school type. So elementary, middle versus high school which is

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:05.360
what we have actually for our suspension indicator. They also talked about chronic absenteeism

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:11.840
and looking at support determinations that their words saying not fair due to COVID that students

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:18.400
need to stay home because of the requirements from local health departments. Also looking at

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:23.200
the growth model as support for that looking at school climate which you're going to hear a lot

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:28.400
about in the next item and then not only support for science but support from links to the science

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:34.320
assessments. There was also interest in looking at a long-term strategy for the college indicator.

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:40.560
You may hear about that at a future meeting. We did have a lot of some consternation about where

01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:47.040
we're at right now with that. Additionally looking at a balance of new information

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:53.600
and just an overwhelming amount of information that's being asked to be added to the dashboard.

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:58.240
So sometimes we don't get to make that decision. The legislature sometimes tells us

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:03.840
things that need to be added and with your feedback we make sure that we meet those

01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:09.760
requirements. But there is limited resources or limited real estate rather on the dashboard

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:15.360
and it can become very overwhelming if we add every single data point that someone asks for.

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:22.000
So that was a consideration from one of the practitioners on the group who I believe is a

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:29.680
local superintendent in the Sacramento area. Also interest in looking at the criteria

01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:34.960
for differentiated assistance and specifically looking at our dashboard alternative school status

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:40.240
schools. There was support for exploring the multiple extended year graduation rate

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:45.920
and then there was also interest in refining the dashboard look for an easier view

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:51.760
and access and so even though we've done a revamp of this once there still is interest in

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:58.320
again continuous improvement. So for next steps for you all we'll be back we'll be back probably

01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:05.120
between September and now to talk about other things but for September specifically our goal

01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:10.480
is assuming that you'd like us to proceed with this work plan that we complete the English Learner

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:15.920
Progress Indicator and we provide you updates and suggested revisions to state indicators

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:22.880
as needed. We also Kim Kim talked about the business rules updates and then finally some of

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:27.840
these pieces that you would that you would potentially make decisions on require us to

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:32.880
reopen the Every Student Succeeds Act state plan and submit an amendment. So we have had some early

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:37.040
discussions with the U.S. Department of Education they are very aware of what we're doing in

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:43.840
California it's nice to have that open dialogue and they are ready to help expedite those

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:50.560
amendments should should you all approve them in September. And so just to close out we have

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:55.760
been busy we've gone to a lot of conferences we've done a lot of virtual meetings and so

01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:04.560
you can see just the amount of of efforts for those activities for the time in which we last

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:10.400
updated you back in November. I also just wanted to give you a preview of some things that we're

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:16.000
tracking when we look at the dashboard itself. We use Google Analytics and we're seeing an average

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:23.760
for the last three months of about 500,000 views as far as unique users of course that's a much

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:32.560
smaller number but we are able to look at you know which pieces folks are looking at which

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:38.880
districts they're looking at sort of like a top 10 list who's using the pdf function which has been

01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:43.440
something that districts like to use especially as they're preparing their local control and

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:47.680
accountability plan. So those are things that we'll try to incorporate in future items but I just

01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:52.400
wanted to give you a heads up this tool is being used of course it has to be used for certain

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:57.680
things but we do believe that you know members of the public are are utilizing it as well and with

01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:01.600
that I will put up the recommendation and I do have the slide for public comment.

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:10.880
All right having taken account of the recommendation why don't we go ahead and

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:18.320
put up the slide for public comment and so we'll open the phone line for the public comment queue

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:26.160
while we then take some public comment in person. Members of the public wishing to provide comment

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:31.040
on this item may do so in person or by calling the telephone number and using the access code

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:35.680
provided on the slide that's shown now while we're waiting for members of the public to call in I

01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:41.760
want to ask our liaison vice president Glover Woods if she has any initial comments for me

01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:47.280
and then I'll add some we'll see if we have any clarifying questions before we go to public comment.

01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:53.920
Yes thank you president Darlingham and just a couple of points to bring forward for consideration

01:20:53.920 --> 01:21:00.640
as we go into our discussion but let me pause and just first thank Cindy and her team for the

01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:08.480
phenomenal work that goes into ensuring our accountability system reflects what the board

01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:16.400
both present and previous have called to do it's they make it look easy and it is not I realize

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:23.680
that very very much and I also appreciate Cindy and her team for the way they are really on a

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:29.040
road show if you will they don't just stay here in Sacramento but they make themselves available

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:36.800
at a variety of conferences and meetings to be able to share as well as to be able to get feedback

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:45.440
so thank you so very much and I will say that I believe our 2023 work plan is indicative of the

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:51.680
philosophy we have for our accountability system which is continuous improvement and we continue to

01:21:51.760 --> 01:22:00.560
look at pieces that are working in the way designed and expected and also look at how we

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:07.200
might be able to do things improve that's what continuous improvement is so just a couple of

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:14.480
very quick areas for us our consideration I want to start first with the LP and just to encourage

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:21.760
and help us to remember that this will be the first year the 2023 dashboard is going to be the

01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:29.200
first year that I since we've had a break that we're going to have the performance level grid

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:36.080
that's going to be based on both status and change similar to some of our other indicators so as we

01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:43.040
are considering where adjustments may need to be made as it relates to cut scores on the status

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:50.160
side and even on the change side I just encourage us to let's get the first full performance level

01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:58.160
grid let's take a look at how that indicates where our schools our LEAs are as far as eligibility

01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:04.800
for differentiated assistance and other support and then as necessary engage in conversations

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:11.200
about making changes but we we don't have the full picture in front of us just yet and I think it

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:18.240
will be important for us to do that before moving forward as it relates to the graduation rate

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:27.200
indicator just to encourage our partners at CDE to keep us informed on how the modeling goes

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:32.400
when we are looking at applying that multi-year graduation rate I think it's a great step that

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:38.480
we're going in that direction and we want to be sure that our DOS schools are benefiting just as

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:44.640
well as the other schools so it'll be important to similarly to how we had that modeling for

01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:48.640
differentiated assistance when we knew there were going to be some changes and we kind of got a

01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:55.200
preview of this is how many the number of LEAs that are going to be eligible in comparison to

01:23:55.200 --> 01:24:01.440
past years I think something like that will be helpful as we explore utilizing a multi-year

01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:08.480
graduation rate but quite excited about going down that road as well and I'll close my comments

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:14.960
with chronic absenteeism and again thank you Cindy for including and spending the first portion of

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:24.480
the presentation to clarify how the chronic absenteeism indicator is determined as well

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:31.120
as giving us the data that is available on data quest and I want us to be sure

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:37.200
especially in light of the comment that was made at the close of the presentation that people are

01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:44.720
accessing this step the dashboard and utilizing that dashboard to make decisions how might we

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:53.920
indicate on the dashboard the impact of the data well the impact that the data has had

01:24:54.560 --> 01:25:03.360
based upon what we know has been the the messaging and expectation for student attendance as it

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:10.480
relates to the pandemic so let me clarify because I want to be very very clear our chronic absenteeism

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:16.640
rate of course is including much more than just what has happened as a result of the pandemic

01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:22.400
but we also know that the messaging has been when students returned and especially with the vaccines

01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:29.120
not being available that it was safe to stay home students should stay home for their safety as well

01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:36.320
as the safety of staff so I do have a strong belief that that has had an impact on the past

01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:42.800
chronic absenteeism data that we've had in the past year or two knowing that and moving forward

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:49.520
looking out the windshield and not the rear view mirror if you will LEAs need to very much so

01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:57.840
really dig into why their chronic absenteeism data is what it is to ensure that it's not just

01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:04.400
the assumption that it's a it's a result of the pandemic there may be some other causes as well

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:09.440
as the county offices that are supporting those that are eligible for differentiated assistance

01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:15.920
as chronic absenteeism is one of those data priority areas to really again just dig into

01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:21.680
let's not assume it's just the pandemic but we do need to acknowledge that the pandemic and the

01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:27.680
response and the messaging that we have given to schools and to families has had some impact so

01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:33.520
I'm wondering on the dashboard is there a way that we might be able to indicate I don't know

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:40.000
quite what that might look like but considering the use of it and I'll close my not so brief

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:48.960
comments at this time thank you very much I'll add mine simply to say that yes I think we're

01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:53.520
we're going to have to think about chronic absenteeism differently it's not that that year's

01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:59.280
I don't think we can assume that that year will be a blip from the pandemic I think we're going to

01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:06.000
continue to see climate related disasters and other things that confuse the question

01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:13.440
as you put it of what is something that is students not getting to school when they could

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:19.120
and should versus not being able to be in school and so I do think that we're going to have to

01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:24.800
re you know continue continue to think about how to evaluate that that indicator and maybe even

01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:30.880
consider whether we want to change the way in which we disaggregate or collect the data

01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:38.720
I mentioned in my earlier remarks too that you know we asked districts during the first year

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:44.960
of the pandemic to prepare a continuous instruction plan so that they were prepared you know to be

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:51.040
able to get laptops to students and you know keep them learning that idea originally came from

01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:58.560
to me from Miami Dade where they had done that because of flooding and where it's a continuous

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:02.800
part of the planning so I think there are these kinds of issues that we're going to need to take

01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:07.840
up I really want to give appreciation as well to the team that's been doing this work they're doing

01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:13.920
amazing work and you can see the work plan is very ambitious we appreciate it I think the

01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:20.400
directions that you're going in terms of thinking of additional indicators are all things that are

01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:26.800
going to be very helpful to us in terms of the extended graduation rate in terms of expanding

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:32.720
the CCI in the ways that you described I think we'll need a new acronym for eBLIP

01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:40.400
we'll have to figure out what we're doing with that and I'll just simply note at this point

01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:46.640
that I would love for us to plan down in the near term future for some additional

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:52.960
presentation to the board about that indicator I know when we looked at it you know a couple

01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:58.400
of years ago as we before the pandemic there are going to be issues because you're trying to link

01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:05.440
the same student to their own record in the same school there are places where you get a very small

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:13.360
sample size and you cannot maintain an indicator for some schools and so we're going to have to

01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:19.440
think through how we handle those kinds of things and so I just love for us to get something on the

01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:26.240
agenda in the next couple of meetings so we can begin to think about about how we're going to

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:33.600
take advantage of the possibility of a growth measure and get a new acronym

01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:44.080
and with that I'm going to see if there are people who are ready to provide public comment in person

01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:50.320
we have one person in the room Andrea Ball from Orange County Department of Ed

01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:56.400
hi good morning thank you Andrea Ball here on behalf of the Orange County Department of Education

01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:02.160
I was here three years ago at your last in-person meeting I'm pretty sure I was speaking on behalf

01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:07.840
of Orange County Department of Ed anyway it's great to have you all here in person so thank you

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:15.440
President Darling-Hammond, Chief Deputy and board members the Orange County Department of Education

01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:20.560
supports the points made in the letter you received from the county superintendents

01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:25.520
related to item three and I just want to call out two points and examples from Orange County

01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:33.920
on the English language progress indicator we support the CDE's recommendation on the work plan

01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:39.120
and I just want to say that Orange County Department of Education has been the state lead

01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:44.640
on the multi-tiered system of support grant program the statewide grant program for about

01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:50.800
eight years and as you all are familiar with that's a program or a framework to really provide

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:57.280
support whole child approaches to all students and Orange County has taken that approach in

01:30:57.280 --> 01:31:04.400
the work they do across areas topics academic social emotional to support the districts the

01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:10.640
28 districts in their county I saw that firsthand during the pandemic and so I want to say that

01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:14.640
in relation to the English language learners for example Orange County is actually

01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:21.040
a national and regional center for the guided language acquisition design model known as guide

01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:28.560
and they work using research-based methodologies to support English learners in the 28 districts

01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:34.320
the over 400,000 students in their county and we think this approach is really important and to

01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:40.960
keep in mind so we do support the CDE recommendation for this indicator to continue working on that

01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:47.360
before making a change second I want to thank you I want to thank the department for the work

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:53.360
on the graduation indicator for the DOS schools Orange County has a large alternative education

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:58.960
program working with students referred from different districts involved in the juvenile

01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:04.400
justice system and really support the work the department has been doing and trying to do with

01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:09.120
this federal department of ed on this indicator so we look forward to being a part of that

01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:14.480
ongoing work group thank you again for all your work and the department too for this great presentation

01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:22.000
thank you and I think at this point we can move to the caller queue on the phone

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.920
uh it looks like we have a roughly around 34 people signed

01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:31.440
up for a public comment on the phone I will open the phone right now

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:37.440
good morning state board of education please state your name and affiliation for the record

01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:39.200
you have one minute your time starts now

01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:48.000
good morning my name is Vanessa Calderon assistant principal at Chano Island

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:54.640
high school over Ventura county over the last several years the one item from um fpm instruct

01:32:54.640 --> 01:33:00.080
instrument that has consistently call out of compliance is designated and integrated ELD

01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:05.600
sadly there's a lack of urgency to improve the district and school site ELD programs

01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:10.960
and with only 24 school districts having to address their students progress

01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:18.080
in learning English as designated by the ELIPI status results the evidence from the federal

01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:24.640
program monitors should urge us to revise the ELPI status cut scores large improvement in the

01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:31.040
district and school English language development program and instruction as a former ELD student

01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:35.360
learning English as a second language at the high school level I firmly believe that our

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:40.640
high school ELD students deserve quality ELD programs that are going to support students to

01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:46.320
achieve English proficiency to be able to move into higher education we request a review of

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:52.320
the ELPI status cut scores so that ELD in my county can be supported thank you thank you

01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:56.400
next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time

01:33:56.400 --> 01:34:07.360
starts now

01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:17.840
caller with the last president board members go ahead yes my time good morning madam president

01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:22.080
board members my name is dr kovionetta hovenfellas and i'm calling on behalf of the law school

01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:26.240
district we support the cd's work plan to maintain the ELPI cut score methodology

01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:29.760
Los Angeles is unified as closely monitoring the performance of English learners students as

01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:34.000
we strive to support their academic and social emotional needs we provide support to teachers

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:38.880
to professional development and model high quality ELS and regarding the college career indicator we

01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:42.240
are pleased to see the integration of additional measures that reflect the experiences of high

01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:46.640
schools today we have concerns on the ability of aptitude tests to demonstrate college career

01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:50.480
readiness we believe the other three proposed measures have the potential to demonstrate much

01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:55.520
greater significance in college readiness than aptitude tests aptitude tests may be great indicators

01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:59.120
of the military but they should not be an appropriate college and career readiness indicator

01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:02.960
we support the inclusion of industry certifications however the state needs to identify these

01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:08.080
certifications for each industry sector estimated colleges offer a wide variety of certifications

01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:12.480
but they are not necessarily industry recognized lastly we wonder whether paid and unpaid

01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:16.560
internships will be considered and look forward to providing additional feedback as cd continues

01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:21.440
to update the cci thank you thank you next caller please state your name and affiliation

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:46.560
dashboard cycle a complete lp indicator will be an important tool to lea's to identify improvements

01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:51.600
that will help serve the needs of english learners thank you thank you next caller please

good morning my name is erica cervantes calling on behalf of alliance for better community we

01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:09.200
are a latino policy and advocacy organization here in la we work closely with parents and

01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:15.760
families in la county and la usd recognizing that latinos make up almost 75 percent of students in

01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:21.120
la usd and looking at the unique needs of these students especially their linguistic needs

01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:25.600
we recognize that although not all latinos students in our english learners a large

01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:32.160
majority are in their places a prioritized population for us we raise similar concerns

01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:36.960
that have already been highlighted by some partners again according to lp nearly half of

01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:42.640
el's did not make progress toward english language proficiency in la county less than half of el's

01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:49.120
made progress toward english proficiency or scored at performance level four based on the lp we

01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:54.640
request a review of the lp status clip scores so that el's in our county can be supported and

01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:59.920
attain english proficiency thank you thank you next caller please state your name and affiliation

madam president members this is eric greenack with charter school development center calling

01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:16.000
in support of the work on the alternative graduation rate methodology and thanks cde staff

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:21.200
for their hard work on that they correctly noted that the one role of the dashboard is to identify

01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:26.480
schools in need of support what they haven't mentioned though is that the dashboard is also

01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:31.680
used for very high stakes charter school renewal decisions and we would like to see

01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:37.680
the work plan expanded to review whether the indicators that are used in the charter renewal

01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:43.920
process are sufficiently stable coming out of the pandemic and methodologically sound for use in

01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:49.200
that high stakes purpose and we would like to see the work plan broadened to address that those

01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:54.000
issues as well thank you thank you next caller please state your name and affiliation for the

01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:55.920
record you have one minute your time starts now

01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:03.920
hello my name is melanie morales vanhecht and i am an assistant director at lmu center for equities

01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:09.360
for english learners our center recommends that the lp cut score thresholds be adjusted to expect

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:15.360
that more students attain annual growth our l cap analysis and statewide compliance reviews point

01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:20.800
to a widespread need for lea's to focus on comprehensive eld for english learner students

01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:26.400
however the lp is not speaking to that same need current cut scores that assign a very low status

01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:32.800
when less than 35 of el's make one level growth set low expectations and do not provide district

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:38.960
data to create the needed urgency to improve el programs we request a review of the lp status

01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:44.640
cut scores so that the lp can be a catalyst that sounds the alarm for lea's and moves them towards

01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:49.280
more supportive practices so english learner students in california can be supported in

01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:54.080
attaining english proficiency thank you thank you next caller please state your

01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:57.040

native san diegan a retired bilingual educator and a certified trainer for ocde project glad

01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:18.720
as you know california public schools serve over six million k-12 students over a million of whom

01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:24.560
are emergent bilinguals my comment today relates to the lp scores not being focused

01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:30.800
on equity for these linguistically diverse students advocates for english learners continue

01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:36.720
to warn that the current cut scores for the lp create complacency in our system when only half

01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:41.680
of el's make annual progress towards english proficiency and that doesn't raise any alarms

01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:46.640
for district administrators we're missing opportunities to improve programs and the

01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:53.120
quality of instruction our expectations should be set in order to produce equitable outcomes

01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:59.200
not to maintain gaps from years past please prevent this inequity so districts that need

01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:05.280
to improve their programs will be supported to do so thank you thank you next caller please

an iqc member title three los angeles county office lead and a district el program specialist

01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:35.520
los angeles county is home to 22 percent of el's in california among my previous laco positions

01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:40.640
my title three team and i provided technical assistance to districts who had not made

01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:46.800
sufficient el progress however now according to lp no districts in my county are going to receive

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:52.880
support this despite the fact that in la county less than half of the else made progress towards

01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:59.120
english proficiency or scored at performance level four based on the lp lp should this low

01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:04.000
bar be considered sufficient for math or english for your children or any group of our students

01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:10.560
we request a review of the lp status cut scores so that el's and my county can be supported

01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:15.840
to attain english proficiency thank you thank you next caller please state your name and

hello my name is melissa martucci and i am a high school teacher in the series unified school

01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:30.720
district my district serves a high number of latino and economically disadvantaged students

01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:36.080
i was excited to see the cast results linked to the on the california dashboard for 2022 and

01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:41.760
2023 indicating the importance and relevance of science in our communities however i feel it is

01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:46.080
of the utmost importance to place science on the dashboard in a way that highlights and supports

01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:50.400
the need to make science a priority in all districts especially at the elementary grade

01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:54.960
level districts rely heavily on indicators from the dashboard for guidance on setting

01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:59.920
budgetary priority thus i urge the state board of education to include a visible performance

01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:06.320
level for the cast or even a status only icon and 2023 so that all districts and principals

01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:11.440
can make science a priority as they develop and refine their l cap plans and treat the core areas

01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:17.360
equally especially in elementary every year we wait to add science is another year science is

01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:23.360
underfunded and or de-prioritized contributing to an overall state looking for highly qualified

01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:28.720
scientists and engineers from other states or even other countries now is the time to change that

01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:33.840
and provide greater opportunity for our students and strengthen our economic growth for our

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:39.360
community in some ways increase equity and opportunity thank you call your time is up

01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:43.200

01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:57.680
we support the education management coalition letter to maintain the lb cut scores through our

01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:02.640
county level one support for our 23 school districts we offer monthly network meetings

01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:08.560
where district el leaders focus on best practices and legal requirements to support their el students

01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:13.760
whether in da or not we also intentionally reach out to districts with consistently low

01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:18.960
performance on the lb and offer data and root cause analyses program evaluation training on

01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:24.640
evidence-based practices workshops for district leaders principals teachers instructional coaches

01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:30.080
one-on-one sessions with new district level el leaders customized services such as designated

01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:36.560
and integrated eld support demo lessons intense intensive intervention again we ask that will you

01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:41.840
stay the course on the lb cuts course at this time and if changes are necessary at a future date

01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:47.360
we look forward to being part of that conversation thank you thank you next caller please state your

hello my name is judan from go public school we and the families we serve are concerned about

01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:06.160
the performance of english english learner students and as such we want to add our voice

01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:10.640
to those who are encouraging the board to revisit the english learner progress indicator

01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:16.240
standards to set higher expectations for district districts in their service of english learner

01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:21.040
students the current status performance levels are inconsistent with students reaching

01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:26.080
classification within the standard five to seven years which allows for schools to fail in supporting

01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:31.280
nearly half of these students from making adequate progress on the road to reclassification

01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:37.920
because of this the board should add to the work plan a revisit to the el pi performance expectations

01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:40.160
prior to finalizing the change component

01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:45.920
thank you next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one

01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:47.120

hi this is patty chavez with c l s e a l dot org acronyms are for reals thank you for your

01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:01.600
presentation and your comments we look forward to seeing you at kabe the number of english learners

01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:06.080
will only continue to grow ceo has provided professional development in more than 200

01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:10.800
elementary and preschool and we're seeing success and through our work we know that whole school

01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:15.760
strategy encourages district leaders critical educators to establish systems and practices

01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:20.560
that support language development literacy and engaging joyful learning for all our students

01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:25.200
and specifically our eels are thriving and succeeding we need this for our students

01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:30.000
and for the future of the state a state where right now nearly half of the else do not make

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:35.840
progress toward english language profusion proficiency according to lpi this is alarming

01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:41.040
it should give us all pause i joined my colleagues today to ask them to just go down

01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:46.080
let's do this right for our students we request a review of the lp status cut scores

01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:51.040
so all el can be supported to attain english language proficiency and we create a strong

01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:56.320
foundation for now and into the future thank you thank you next caller please state your

01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:59.120
name and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time starts now

01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:04.640
My name is Kim Moreno and I'm an educator with over 20 years of experience in San Diego County

01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:09.200
where only three of 37 LEAs were identified as needing assistance for their english learners

01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:13.840
so while I understand there is no minimum quota for identifying districts with very low status

01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:18.160
there is a need to continuously revisit these scores when districts with only 50 percent of

01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:23.280
their EL showing progress receive medium status it does cause concern my mind immediately goes to

01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:27.120
this being a recipe for a continued creation of long-term english language proficiency

01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:32.480
continued creation of long-term english learners in the state with the current cut scores over 99

01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:37.360
percent of all California ELs were enrolled in districts that are not sized for needing attention

01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:41.760
indicating our accountability system is not capturing the need of ELs for more support

01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:45.920
this lends itself to EL programs not being given the attention needed to refine practices that

01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:50.640
serve their students with district resources being diverted to other areas revising cut scores will

01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:56.800
identify more EL LEAs needing support and hence their EL programs will have the support to

01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:02.400
continue to improve I support the continued review of LP status prep scores so that our ELs in my

01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:06.400
county can be supported to change english proficiency thank you for all the work that you do

01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:10.880
thank you next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute

Pete Ahern president of the California Association of Science Educators speaking on behalf of the

01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:23.280
coalition of science educators and organizations we are meeting tomorrow at the Exploratorium if

01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:27.600
any of you would like to join us we are energized by what we heard about assessment yesterday and

01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:31.680
especially our good friend Stephen Pruitt's insights we thank CDE for its work on adding

01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:35.680
science to the dashboard let's talk about what we know about science education we know that

01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:40.240
many careers and the future of California's economy are in STEM fields and the next generation science

01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:44.880
standards are all about STEM engineering data science integration of math and technology

01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:49.280
and computer science it's in the NGSS and we know that in learning to read students need to

01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:53.360
engage with rigorous and compelling content like science we know that hands-on science with the

01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:57.840
proper supports is a powerful vehicle for english language learning and despite this we have heard

01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:02.400
from districts and administrators over and over again all over the state that they won't invest

01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:06.320
in science because it's not on the dashboard and their priorities are set by the dashboard

01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:09.760
please help us give students the science education they deserve by putting a science

01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:15.520
status-only icon on the dashboard let's do this thank you thank you next caller please state

01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:18.400
your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time starts now

01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:25.920
good morning my name is Sarah Lillis I'm executive director of Teach Bus California

01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:29.920
I want to thank the staff for all their hard work on the 2023 accountability work plan we're

01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:33.920
really excited to see the development of the visualizations and communication materials for

01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:38.720
the student growth data as well as the plan to begin objective criteria for the teacher

01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:43.120
assignment monitoring outcome we share concerns about the need to revisit the lb

01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:48.640
direct expectations we don't believe we can wait because we are worried about the message we're

01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:53.680
sending if we are not setting up our students to be able to reclassify within the five to seven

01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:58.560
years we also are eager to support the department in this year's work to develop communications and

01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:03.280
visualization tools for the growth model but we would also ask the work plan reflect the outline

01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:08.480
and timeline for the work necessary to add student growth to the dashboard itself as well as perhaps

01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:12.800
revisiting a name change and as it relates to the college career indicator we urge the

01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:17.120
board to direct staff to develop a plan and timeline for establishing a fourth level of

01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:23.040
preparedness well prepared which would allow us to transform this into a college and career indicator

01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:27.360
thank you thank you next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you

01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:36.080

01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:42.240
I'm an EL support teacher in the world academy newcomer program at Mount Diablo high school

01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:47.600
in Concord California and I'm here this morning representing Contra Costa County

01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:54.960
home of 28,000 English learners according to ELPI only one district in my county

01:50:54.960 --> 01:51:01.040
is going to receive support for helping EL's in learning English thanks to the ELPI

01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:08.640
this despite the fact that in my county less than half of English learners made progress

01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:15.760
towards English proficiency or scored at performance level four based on the LP this year

01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:23.120
in our specific newcomer program we have had over 100 newcomer students arrive in just six months

01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:27.440
many are coming to us unaccompanied or with traumatic

01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:36.240
backgrounds we respectfully request a review of the ELPI status cut scores so that English learners

01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:43.840
in my county can be supported to attain English proficiency thank you so much thank you next

Raza is the nation's largest Latino civil rights non-profit benefit network of over

01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:22.720
300 community-based organizations we work to advance the academic needs of Latino and

01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:28.160
more bilingual students across the country and in California it is imperative we support English

01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:33.680
learners and the best way to do that is by making sure ELs with the lowest initial proficiency

01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:38.400
receive the necessary support that will only be possible with the review of the LP status

01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:44.000
cut scores our research shows that Latino families have high expectations

01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:48.800
for their children including seeing them advance in English skills and academics

01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:52.720
only those U.S. advocates for states to ensure that ELs are making meaningful gains in English

01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:57.920
proficiency and set ambitious achievable goals for ELs California and we know that California

01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:02.160
deserves a model for the rest of the nation we request a review of the LP status cut scores

01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:08.080
so that California's ELs can attain English proficiency thank you thank you next caller

work plans especially keeping the methodology for calculating the LP cut scores in alignment

01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:35.440
with the other indicators we would also like to advocate that the SBE revisit the differentiated

01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:41.280
assistance eligibility criteria specifically considering how to shift differentiated assistance

01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:46.160

good morning good morning this is Liz Guian with public advocates

01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:12.080
Ms. Kazanis did a fabulous presentation and really emphasized that the dashboard

01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:18.640
serves to inject urgency for improvement we believe strongly in the equity coalition that the

01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:25.760
English learner performance indicator needs that urgency I echo comments by Sally Fox of CAVE which

01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:30.960
are included in the equity coalition's written comments as the department and commission on

01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:36.960
teacher credentialing continue to work on the teaching assignment monitoring data the TAMO

01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:43.040
released last year we encourage them to conduct an analysis of the available teacher assignment

01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:48.800
data by student group and include that information on the dashboard and an additional report such as

01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:54.560
the school accountability report card we think that will help the establishment of objective

01:54:54.560 --> 01:55:01.040
criteria by which to judge teacher quality and equity that was required by the legislature

01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:06.480
at the school and the district level thank you thank you next caller please state your name

01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:09.200
and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time starts now

01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:17.040
good morning my name is Araceli Simeon with the parent organization network we have been leading

01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:21.760
campaigns to improve outcomes for English learners in three school districts for the past two years

01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:27.760
we learned that teachers need support to provide ELD instruction and districts need better systems

01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:33.200
to monitor progress furthermore we learned that many of our members who are engaged parents and

01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:38.640
serve on ELACs and DLACs have children who have become long-term English learners despite having

01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:44.640
A's and B's on their report cards and occasional fours on their LPAC tests overall there's an

01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:50.480
incoherence in the system the reclassification requirements hold EL to a very high standard

01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:55.120
for they must prove three different ways that they're fluent in English but the current LP

01:55:55.120 --> 01:56:00.800
only looks at LPAC scores and the current CUT scores at low standards for LEAs our

01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:06.400
recommendation is to align the LP to reclassification requirements otherwise the only

01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:12.000
ones being held accountable to high standards and held back for it are the very students that it's

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:18.720
the LCFF is supposed to help thank you thank you next caller please state your name and affiliation

01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:20.800

01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:29.680
good morning chair darling hamson board i am ken falls you have board member of action i would

01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:34.800
do say unified school district a small rural district north los angeles county we're at the

01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:40.080
competent direction of dr eric sahaki and as you know the annual publication of challenges at the

01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:45.920
state level can be seen by some as an opportunity to compare and paint out LEA or even local county

01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:52.400
levels as not as bad as most unfortunately percentile achievement bar comparisons inherently

01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:57.440
discount and exclude success at the individual student level i agree with the vice chair who

01:56:57.440 --> 01:57:03.120
just noted that consideration of individualities and responsibilities at the local level is key

01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:09.760
as a solution to performance at the state level because local performance feeds state level

01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:15.680
success tonight at the board meeting i will share my altruistic take on this part of CDE

01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:20.800
meeting today and ask staff to compare our LEA numbers against the state trend and to celebrate

01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:26.000
the successes that make our district unique in the statewide data and to take those successes

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:30.640
to work on the other parts of the pie chart that are not so desirable while taking advantage of the

01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:37.200
state that will support the thank you your time is up what's in place thank you next caller please

your time starts now good morning lindsey tornatory calling on behalf of the california

01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:21.520
county superintendent thank you cindy and kim for your presentation especially for always making

01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:26.640
very complex topics accessible for all of us as explained in our letters we support the cd's

01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:31.920
proposal for the lp we want to point out that lea's do not wait until they are identified for

01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:36.880
differentiated assistance to provide support to their english learners for example county

01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:41.760
offices have found great value in sharing the work of the e-week el roadmap with their district

01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:46.400
specifically around disaggregating el data through the l cap which we all learned about during the

01:58:46.400 --> 01:58:51.760
november board meeting also in our letter we request the board re-examine the da criteria so

01:58:51.760 --> 01:58:56.960
that county offices with the highest needs are identified as opposed to all county offices being

01:58:56.960 --> 01:59:01.440
identified in perpetuity we appreciate the attention to the grad rate particularly as it

01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:06.080
pertains to dap however currently we do remain concerned the multi-year rate will not make a

01:59:06.080 --> 01:59:12.160
difference but of course eager to discuss once data is run thank you very much thank you next

01:59:12.160 --> 01:59:15.680
caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time starts now

01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:22.640
hi this is robert manoring from children now first i want to commend the board and the cd staff for

01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:27.440
their continuous improvement approach particularly around the teacher assignment monitoring science

01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:32.880
assessment and growth models we look forward to seeing how these indicators are eventually

01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:37.920
found find their way to the dashboard i also wanted to address the performance standards for

01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:44.960
the lp as other public comment has suggested there's a need to readdress those the suggestion

01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:52.480
the suggestion that there's a standardized process for looking at performance on a pure

01:59:53.040 --> 01:59:59.040
percent distribution is is not true past boards have deviated substantially from that as an

01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:05.600
example the very low cut score for one indicator is at the fifth percentile for another indicator

02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:12.960
is at the 24th percentile similarly for the state performance levels the high bar that varies from

02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:19.840
31 percentile for one indicator and 87th for a different one there's dramatic board input

02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:25.360
in these standards and we hope that this board will relook at the the standards that you've set

02:00:25.360 --> 02:00:30.640
for this uh and adjust them upward thank you thank you next caller please state your name

02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:34.000
and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time starts now

02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:41.680
hello my name is michael pelikowski i am the director of curriculum and technology for

02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:45.760
gridly unified school district and i believe we are the small rural school district that

02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:51.120
cindy kazanets referred to earlier in her presentation where currently at day 100 we see

02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:57.520
54 percent of our tk students with chronic absenteeism and 47 percent of our k i call

02:00:57.520 --> 02:01:02.560
today in reference to the criteria that are utilized for atsi determinations and how those

02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:08.400
negatively affect small districts our mckinley elementary school is a tk through grade one

02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:14.480
which as a result of its grade spans and small size really only has one indicator its chronic

02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:21.360
absenteeism rate so it was identified for atsi on the basis of a single indicator chronic absenteeism

02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:27.280
this also affects our gridley high school of about 650 students because we have small numbers of

02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:32.720
english learners at the high school and students with disabilities uh they do not test in 11th

02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:37.200
well they test but there is not enough students with disabilities or el to register

02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:43.840
so also gridley high school was identified for atsi on the basis of a single indicator that of

02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:51.120
suspension rate for its special education and el students i want to raise the board

02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:56.880
awareness thank you thank you next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record

hello i'm dr lena bocchi mccain board secretary for the california association of science educators

02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:13.280
and executive director of the non-profit stem for real a professional learning organization

02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:18.400
i also served as a former california science teacher and administrator i want to ensure that

02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:23.760
science is seen as a prominent indicator on the california school dashboard i say prominent

02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:29.520
because the indicator cannot be a series of clicks like the movie inception where the indicator is

02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:35.680
hidden under various web pages schools and district administrators must view science as having equal

02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:42.480
footing with mathematics and ela instructions otherwise science is not taught teachers have

02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:47.760
explicitly stated that they cannot teach science every day because their time is focused on math

02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:54.320
writing and ela demands our accountability system must support science as teaching every day

02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:59.360
watch the magic that happens with decreasing chronic absenteeism and increasing language

02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:03.040
acquisition for emergent bilingual students supported with research

02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:09.280

hi um my name is samantha schmidt and i am the teen and teacher coordinator for a non-profit

02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:30.240
called gintana's wildlife society that provides outdoor education for youth and families along

02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:36.880
the monterey peninsula and i'm also a member of the california association of science educators

02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:42.000
environmental literacy committee i would first like to thank the school board of california for

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:46.960
allowing the space to speak on the importance of science and for me specifically the role of

02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:53.120
environmental education within that field it would be so meaningful to see a science status

02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:59.120
owing icon on the california dashboard as it would provide data links and other helpful resources

02:03:59.680 --> 02:04:05.440
whether nature is brought into the classroom or on impromptu teachable moments on nature walks

02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:11.120
environmental education has proven that there is an abundance of benefits for younger generations

02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:18.240
school and especially educators environmental education also helps with social emotional

02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:24.480
learning ecological culture and economic issues thank you so much for your time and consideration

02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:29.440
with adding science on the california dashboard thank you next caller please state your name and

good evening this is manuel buenrostro with california together and we are again raising

02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:47.920
concerns about the low expectations that are being set by the lp indicator and urge the board to not

02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:53.760
rubber stamp low expectations for our el's we cannot claim to have an equity focused system

02:04:53.760 --> 02:04:58.480
when despite the fact that nearly half of el's do not make progress towards english proficiency

02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:05.040
we are still okay with only identifying 24 school districts and five county offices of education

02:05:05.920 --> 02:05:11.760
this represents less than one percent of el's statewide this is also not even close to an

02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:16.560
equitable distribution of leas as we're only identifying four percent of school districts

02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:23.760
and coes that are eligible for an lp rating again according to lp nearly half of el's

02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:29.760
are not making progress towards english language proficiency we again urge the board to look into

02:05:29.760 --> 02:05:35.280
revising the lp cut scores and ensure that our lea's get the support that they need thank you

02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:39.280

and presently i'm a county office of education administrator where i lead multilingual programs

02:06:04.880 --> 02:06:11.040
and i provide services to 33 districts i attended the bilingual coordinators network

02:06:11.040 --> 02:06:17.200
on february 16th where the discussion on the lp cut scores occurred most of my colleagues

02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:22.080
are concerned for our english learners because the current lp cut scores will not reveal the

02:06:22.080 --> 02:06:27.520
real need in all districts in california we believe in our english learners and have high

02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:33.120
expectations for them we urge the board to improve the status cut scores for english learners and

02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:40.320
revise the lp status cut scores before developing the change and the five by five grid for change

02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:45.520
again we request the review of the lp status cut scores so that el's in my county can be

02:06:45.520 --> 02:06:51.760
supported to attain english proficiency thank you thank you next caller please state your

i'm an elementary instructional coach in palm springs unified school district

02:07:22.720 --> 02:07:27.360
and a parent of a california student with special needs i would like to first thank the cde and

02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:32.480
state board for their commitment to all of california students we need to see an icon for

02:07:32.480 --> 02:07:40.400
science on the dashboard this would be a clear indicator clear signal to lea that they need to

02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:46.320
invest in science education at all levels science results in a tab or pull down menu are not

02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:51.840
sufficient to signify science education as a priority and because of this lea's have not

02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:57.040
adequately invested in science professional learning for teachers science can be integrated

02:07:57.040 --> 02:08:02.720
into daily elementary and education to support improving california students literacy skills

02:08:02.720 --> 02:08:07.840
science provides authentic and common experiences that give students equitable background knowledge

02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:13.440
they require to be able to comprehend the text that they read students love science but unfortunately

02:08:13.440 --> 02:08:18.320
are not given access to it daily due to the prioritization of subjects that do appear on

02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:23.440
the dashboard please help us give our students the education they deserve by placing a science

02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:28.480
icon on this year's dashboard thank you thank you next caller please state your name and

02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:39.600
good morning my name is ruth barajas with californians together we're very concerned

02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:44.320
that the cda's work plan does not include a review of the lp cut scores for status

02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:49.280
we believe the current status performance levels are far too low and inconsistent with

02:08:49.280 --> 02:08:53.760
the research findings that el should be expected to reach reclassification within five to seven

02:08:53.760 --> 02:09:00.320
years others have mentioned and i will reiterate that those current cut scores only identify one

02:09:00.320 --> 02:09:08.640
percent of el's for support yet california has nearly half of the el's 49 not making progress

02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:13.680
or who are below four level four proficiency if we look at identifying numbers based on

02:09:13.680 --> 02:09:19.680
percentile distribution which is based on the actual data some people would call this

02:09:19.680 --> 02:09:25.040
maintaining the status quo this is a big concern especially if you want to prevent high numbers

02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:30.240
of long-term english learners in the future shouldn't a system of accountability hold all

02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:36.080
of us accountable to our student success we're asking you to slow down and revise the status

02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:42.320
cut scores for lp please thank you thank you next caller please state your name and affiliation

02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:44.320

hi sarah kennedy at the california association for bilingual education

02:09:53.280 --> 02:09:58.320
previously i've worked in multiple california charter schools as an educator and el coordinator

02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:02.400
and now collaborate with counties and districts across the state so i know the importance of

02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:06.800
ensuring that all students get the support they need to progress in english proficiency

02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:12.240
looking for progress each year a student is with us should be the bare minimum and i'm concerned

02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:18.320
about the low bar set by the current cut scores as so many others have mentioned as an educator

02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:23.520
and advocate having less than half of students making progress would indicate a clear need for

02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:29.600
support and further analysis but the current cut scores that is labeled as medium status is

02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:34.880
progress for less than half of our students acceptable for california we request a review

02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:39.440
of the lp status cut scores so that eels in our state can be supported to attain english

02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:44.560
proficiency thank you thank you next caller please state your name and affiliation for the

02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:52.000
record you have one minute your time starts now good morning patty Herrera on behalf of the

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:57.520
association of california school administrators as part of a statewide education coalition

02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:03.040
access support cde's proposed work plan for the english learner progress indicator

02:11:03.040 --> 02:11:07.920
furthermore lea's proactively assist english learners well before they are identified for

02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:14.320
differentiated assistance if ever for example one of our districts offers daily eld through a

02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:20.000
deployment model based on lpac performance levels and domains they provide on-demand model teaching

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:25.680
or side-by-side teaching moments and integrated eld professional development to all teachers in

02:11:25.680 --> 02:11:31.200
order to support their english learners throughout the comprehensive program parental support is

02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:35.600
also offered through literacy nights and through a nine-week course that shows them how to better

02:11:35.600 --> 02:11:41.040
support their students and how to navigate the education system as a whole therefore we think

02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:45.760
the answer to better supporting our english learners is in leveraging the level one universal

02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:52.880
resources that are available available to all lea's regardless of da status thank you thank you

02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:56.800
next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time starts

02:11:56.800 --> 02:12:05.840
now my name is arlene laurason i am a 912 science teacher from elk Grove unified school district

02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:10.560
and a member of the california association of science educators on the ngfs committee

02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:14.480
we appreciate the work that you have done in promoting science education in california

02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:22.400
thank you as a 912 educator who has been using ngfs since 2014 i know firsthand that the students

02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:28.400
entering my class are behind we are asking that an icon for science be added to the dashboard

02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:33.840
this will send a clear message to districts to increase funding for science why is more funding

02:12:33.840 --> 02:12:38.800
needed currently the vision of the california front framework for science education for all

02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:44.160
students is not being met most elementary school teachers as well as science teachers in general

02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:49.600
are not prepared to use the new instructional shift and many of them have inadequate instructional

02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:55.280
materials to assist them the k-12 progressions outlined in the framework are not possible if

02:12:55.280 --> 02:13:00.000
students enter middle school with a science background resembling swiss cheese science

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:05.840
education will not improve unless funding is increased please add a science icon to the

02:13:05.840 --> 02:13:10.560
dashboard thank you thank you next caller please state your name and affiliation for

02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:12.480
the record you have one minute your time starts now

02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:20.160
good morning presidents don lingham and the members of the board i'm dr huling lee executive

02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:26.080
director of authentic preparation today or apt a statewide group that has been collaborating cde

02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:31.680
on the state seal civic engagement since 2018 we appreciate and support your articulated vision

02:13:31.680 --> 02:13:38.240
of migrating the cci to ccci to include civic readiness when the seal was approved and your

02:13:38.240 --> 02:13:43.200
direction to form the civic engagement work group to support this vision however that effort has

02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:48.320
been halted due to calc has upgrades the civic field is a very important indicator because high

02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:53.200
quality civic engagement projects encompass relevant rigorous and engaging student learning

02:13:53.200 --> 02:13:58.240
experiences and authentic assessments that support college career and civic readiness

02:13:58.240 --> 02:14:02.800
however given the lack of state support for consistent implementation there are equity

02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:07.600
issues playing out in the field so i would like to request for the state to reinstate the civic

02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:12.080
engagement work group to ensure that equity and excellence is adhered to and the field will be

02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:18.560
included in the dashboard thank you thank you that concludes public comment for item number three

02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:26.960
all right thanks to everyone who's called in thanks again to the staff for all of the work

02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:28.800
we're now open for board discussion

02:14:32.240 --> 02:14:33.680
member roscoe gonzalez

02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:44.080
and listening let me make sure and listening to all the comments and and cindy and your team's

02:14:44.080 --> 02:14:50.800
presentation um you know i come back and i kind of reinstate some of the comments that i did in

02:14:50.800 --> 02:14:55.840
july i mentioned the importance of having a science icon on the dashboard sorry it's hard

02:14:55.840 --> 02:15:01.760
to speak with a mask this would provide districts and schools with a clear message that science

02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:07.600
results are important and that science instruction needs to be planned and implemented and that

02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:14.240
science learning matters when we have discussions about chronic absenteeism i know firsthand as a

02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:20.160
science teacher that science gets kids excited about coming to school to explore and work on

02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:24.320
hands-on experiments even yesterday during our assessment study session

02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:29.200
that was even some of the conversations over performance tasks and them

02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:35.120
continuously working on these performance tests in science and it aligns to our principles

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:40.960
focusing on elements that express the commitment to a well-rounded well-supported education

02:15:41.840 --> 02:15:47.360
a clear visual visualization and clear communication when it comes to like principle seven

02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:53.440
i think it's also critical that the CAS be included on the dashboard in 2023 because

02:15:53.440 --> 02:15:59.360
districts are unlikely to make investments and improve science instruction if it's not clear

02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:04.720
on the dashboard i know as a teacher when we have conversations around assessments in the dashboard

02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:12.800
mostly they're around language arts and mathematics and with a background in science and a father

02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:16.160
i mean my father was an engineer i always think of the importance of

02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:22.960
continuously bringing shedding light to the to school districts how important

02:16:22.960 --> 02:16:30.320
equally important science is so i think that we should look into that as part of the work

02:16:30.320 --> 02:16:39.200
that we go we do as we go forward thank you cindy do you want to remind us what the status of

02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:51.600
science as a element on the dashboard is sure i'm happy to review science and so we are waiting for

02:16:51.600 --> 02:16:57.600
another year of test scores so the 2023 administration that i guess is probably

02:16:57.600 --> 02:17:06.560
starting any day now will help to feed into allowing us to look at establishing cut scores

02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:11.120
for our science indicator i think what is unclear to us and what we need to explore with you all

02:17:12.240 --> 02:17:18.880
in 2024 is where does this live does it live as part of the academic indicator you know how

02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:23.760
is it used or is it used in differentiated assistance how is it used or is it used for

02:17:23.760 --> 02:17:30.800
identification or eligibility for school eligibility under the every student succeeds act and so

02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:38.080
there's some real deep policy considerations that we will absolutely elevate

02:17:38.080 --> 02:17:44.880
as we move forward with reviewing those those cut scores and so at this time the way that we

02:17:44.880 --> 02:17:51.600
have approached science per your direction is it is available off of the dashboard there is a link

02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:57.280
from the dashboard it is one click away i think what what you are asking for member

02:17:57.920 --> 02:18:03.920
gonzalez is that we we put it as an icon and an icon for for the for the dashboard means something

02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:09.360
there's usually something that looks like the dashboard numbers behind it and because we don't

02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:15.920
yet have that available set of data we can't provide the context that we're used to seeing

02:18:15.920 --> 02:18:22.880
on the dashboard and so i believe what you may be proposing may lead to some confusion if it was

02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:30.480
elevated as an icon prematurely but with that said we have provided support for this for this

02:18:30.480 --> 02:18:37.360
metric through through a flyer and i think if anything because we've had so much interest from

02:18:37.360 --> 02:18:43.840
the science community is again presenting to to their audiences or to others maybe it's through

02:18:43.840 --> 02:18:50.080
cisc just talking about how you know our road ahead and that we welcome everybody's input as

02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:56.640
this develops into a potential indicator thank you and i think there's a just to flag for the

02:18:56.640 --> 02:19:02.880
board a question that we'll need to take up when we when the dashboard was designed it was designed

02:19:02.880 --> 02:19:09.360
with the idea of let's bring the state and federal accountability systems together so what's on the

02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:17.600
dashboard is used in the federally required determinations of districts that will be

02:19:18.560 --> 02:19:27.120
you know in a supporter intervention context we we can make a decision if we you know deliberate

02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:31.600
on it and choose to do so that there would be things on the dashboard that are not used in the

02:19:31.600 --> 02:19:38.160
federally required determination that would be a very different decision than the board had made

02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:42.960
before which you know they made that decision for good reason to try to bring things together but

02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:50.560
you know that that's a part of the context here is what is going into those determinations as

02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:56.800
well as what goes on the dashboard the department of education has actually invited states to

02:19:56.800 --> 02:20:03.520
revise their plans and to incorporate additional indicators especially of learning opportunities

02:20:04.480 --> 02:20:08.400
and they have made it clear that they stand ready to look at those you know

02:20:09.040 --> 02:20:14.640
um potential changes and cindy let us know earlier that we will be going back

02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:20.240
around some of these things so it's a it's a conversation for us to have on another day

02:20:21.200 --> 02:20:27.600
because we won't have time today to have that big conversation and i think it would be very

02:20:27.600 --> 02:20:32.560
helpful as we come back to some of these things if you could put the lp slides back up again

02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:38.960
because there's a lot of commentary in that and i wonder if everyone is understanding the

02:20:40.400 --> 02:20:47.680
indicator the same way so i don't know if you can find those and help us with that again

02:20:49.120 --> 02:20:55.840
my understanding is as you explained it earlier was that the progress on the the number of students

02:20:55.840 --> 02:21:06.560
making progress on the indicator is determined by how many move from you know like level one to

02:21:06.560 --> 02:21:11.200
level two or level two to level three is that correct level three to level four

02:21:12.880 --> 02:21:20.640
yeah yes that is that is the calculation and then there are four levels right there are six levels

02:21:20.640 --> 02:21:28.000
there are four levels of of lpac and it's translated into six levels for the lp so

02:21:28.880 --> 02:21:35.600
you can see on the so just wanted to make sure which slide you were yeah and so if a student

02:21:35.600 --> 02:21:42.640
moves up a level in the six levels they are counted as making progress on that indicator

02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:46.720
and so the assumption underneath it is that if you have

02:21:47.360 --> 02:21:54.160
um moved up a level every year you would have acquired english language proficiency if you

02:21:54.160 --> 02:21:59.680
started at the bottom level in six years is that is that the right way to be interpreting that

02:22:01.680 --> 02:22:08.400
yeah yes and that's so it's a little more ambitious that many people say five to seven

02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:12.000
years is the sort of expectation so it's a little more ambitious than the upper

02:22:12.720 --> 02:22:19.120
um tier of that a little less ambitious than the lower tier of that and then when you look at

02:22:20.080 --> 02:22:27.120
the cut scores for district identification this is the percent of students making progress

02:22:28.480 --> 02:22:34.560
toward proficiency it's not the percentile ranking of the district against other districts

02:22:35.120 --> 02:22:40.320
it is the percent of students making progress right okay just want to be sure everybody has

02:22:40.320 --> 02:22:46.080
it because i heard it referred to as percentile rankings of districts which is is not what's going

02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:51.280
on just so everybody's clear that this is about the movement of students and these are these are

02:22:51.280 --> 02:22:56.080
matched students as well so you're we're looking we were able to capture the same student moving

02:22:56.080 --> 02:23:03.360
through the the system and what a student changes schools or districts um what is the rule about

02:23:04.320 --> 02:23:10.800
where they are counted so we would be able to capture them at their last um school or

02:23:10.800 --> 02:23:15.360
or district as reported in the california longitudinal pupil achievement system that's

02:23:15.360 --> 02:23:21.040
one of the advantages of having a statewide identifier for every student in public school

02:23:21.040 --> 02:23:27.040
in california is to allow for credit to be received at the last place in which the student

02:23:27.040 --> 02:23:34.400
was enrolled so um there's a question that um that was bubbling around is whether whether this

02:23:34.400 --> 02:23:38.880
is really a criterion reference system it really is a criterion reference system the number of

02:23:38.880 --> 02:23:46.480
students who make progress each year the percentage of those is set to the criterion that is on the lp

02:23:47.040 --> 02:23:54.560
or on the lpac and then translated over to the lp so it is a criterion reference which means that

02:23:54.560 --> 02:23:59.200
the percentage of districts that falls in any one of these categories in a given year will change

02:23:59.840 --> 02:24:10.160
based on the progress of the students how many of the students make a category of progress each year

02:24:10.160 --> 02:24:15.120
i just want to start the conversation if there is any question about this just with us all being

02:24:15.200 --> 02:24:22.800
clear about what's what's going on yes um member terry yashimoto thank you board president

02:24:25.200 --> 02:24:32.160
just briefly i wanted to just say about the science assessment um i second your interest

02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:38.000
in urgency around it but i now understand that there is a lot of conversation that has to happen

02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:43.760
so for another day but that is where a lot of other content areas come together and students

02:24:43.760 --> 02:24:48.160
interests um heighten so on the lp

02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:56.400
i'm going to separate the conversation around differentiated assistance from the experience of

02:24:56.400 --> 02:25:01.680
our young people for just a minute because at the risk of oversimplifying my concept of

02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:07.280
differentiated assistance it like a common fairy tale i always think of it as like having too many

02:25:07.280 --> 02:25:12.160
schools for differentiated assistance not enough schools identified for differentiated assistance

02:25:12.160 --> 02:25:18.080
and the just right amount and it seems like with nclb we had too many schools it seems like now

02:25:18.080 --> 02:25:23.920
there may be not enough schools identified and so i'm interested in hearing about the feasibility

02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:31.440
of a solution that brings us to a just right amount um because i think we know that multilingual

02:25:31.440 --> 02:25:41.040
learners um deserve the expectation to demonstrate annual growth uh to move levels and to address

02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:45.040
sort of the experience of a young person their experience is very different if they haven't

02:25:45.040 --> 02:25:51.040
reclassified by middle school uh and particularly by high school so it affects programming as you

02:25:51.040 --> 02:25:54.560
know as many of you know i mean it affects programming it affects their ability to take

02:25:54.560 --> 02:26:00.800
electives it affects their ultimate college and career outcomes and it's not just our multilingual

02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:06.080
learners including our multilingual learners many of them are also duly identified as having uh

02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:11.600
as being eligible for special education services so it's very nuanced around the supports that our

02:26:11.600 --> 02:26:18.880
students need to be able to classify so i say all that to say there is a sense of urgency and i

02:26:18.880 --> 02:26:27.680
worry that uh the current norm reference uh that on the status portion alone does under identify

02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:34.320
uh supports and from a parent's perspective feels really feels low to me

02:26:35.520 --> 02:26:40.080
when we look at the actual percentages of students that we're expecting to show annual growth

02:26:43.120 --> 02:26:50.880
i'll pause there and and this may be another one that needs a deeper deeper dive um and um

02:26:51.680 --> 02:26:55.920
i wanted to see if cindy wants to offer any comments about that but whether

02:26:56.720 --> 02:27:00.800
we should be anticipating diving back in on that question

02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:08.080
we look we look to the board for that direction i think we've you know what i've tried to convey

02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:15.200
through the slide presentation and in prior presentations is uh the desire of the board to

02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:24.240
have indicators that are designed the same and so that you can go to any one indicator and you

02:27:24.240 --> 02:27:30.240
can look at the distributions of how they were set up and that it's not an arbitrary we expect

02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:36.640
very low to be set at 50 that's that's not how the system was designed if there's a desire to

02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:42.400
to change that and to have something that is different for this one indicator you know again

02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:49.200
we're here to serve you and so we would we would take that direction i think you will see um you

02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:55.920
know opportunities for um this metric to potentially identify more i mean i can't guarantee it because

02:27:55.920 --> 02:28:00.560
i don't have i don't have the data for this coming year but with with the adoption of the change cut

02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:06.160
scores that's where that's where really a lot comes in the expectation of if you're maintaining

02:28:06.160 --> 02:28:11.120
or if you're declining you know you're going to be in the lower end of our performance um color

02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:16.880
system on the five by five grid so you know we will be that is absolutely on our our plan um as

02:28:16.880 --> 02:28:21.680
we've discussed already um that we will bring back in september but if there's something different

02:28:21.680 --> 02:28:26.400
you want us to do with the status cut scores and revisit something that you've already adopted

02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:32.960
again we would we would look for direction from from the board on and forgive me if this has

02:28:32.960 --> 02:28:38.400
already happened and i you know neglected to attend to it but um i'm wondering if a memo on

02:28:38.400 --> 02:28:46.080
this that gives us like the detailed data about the both the history and the current distribution

02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:50.880
and the distribution each year would be helpful for people to really get their brains wrapped

02:28:50.880 --> 02:28:57.360
around the history and the current status and then in september we can you know we will see

02:28:57.360 --> 02:29:03.840
additional data we'll be able to think about what the path forward ought to be does that make sense

02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:07.920
yes i think you're asking us to bring together um pieces that we've brought to the board at

02:29:07.920 --> 02:29:12.560
various meetings and to their location um we cannot absolutely uh you know i think that would

02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:18.240
help us and then when we have our next conversation we'll have all of the background yes i'm member

02:29:18.240 --> 02:29:25.600
escapado and i understand that you know there's systems but i think the purpose right is to

02:29:26.720 --> 02:29:34.400
hopefully utilize the data to inform instruction maybe create uh different systems and structures

02:29:34.400 --> 02:29:41.760
to help students right and when i when i look at the task scores for english learners

02:29:43.360 --> 02:29:49.280
they've they seem to be very low however when you look at re-designated students they're much

02:29:49.280 --> 02:29:55.280
higher and i and i just wondered where's that sweet spot when you look at percentages moving

02:29:56.320 --> 02:30:02.240
from one level to the other where where do they become reclassified and if we can somehow

02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:11.040
figure out a way to look at that area of reclassification because really that is the

02:30:11.040 --> 02:30:22.480
threshold that we want students to achieve right and and use that perhaps as a end in mind because

02:30:22.480 --> 02:30:31.360
this is where we want we know when we look at the the facts that once you achieve reclassification

02:30:31.440 --> 02:30:40.000
you're going to do well in many of those metrics so i just may be looking at the system in a

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:46.560
different way to ensure that we are focusing on the successes for students just just enough

02:30:48.080 --> 02:30:54.320
that's helpful and i would just also offer i think it would be helpful for you all to be um uh

02:30:56.480 --> 02:31:01.280
to know what the other indicators have because we don't have other indicators that have that

02:31:01.280 --> 02:31:07.920
high threshold of over 50 for very in a very low status right so you know this operates as a system

02:31:07.920 --> 02:31:15.120
and each of these were developed off of each other and so i think again historically it is

02:31:15.120 --> 02:31:21.040
very in the you know in the weeds seems like you all want to delve into the numbers and so if we

02:31:21.040 --> 02:31:26.240
could also provide the context for the other state indicators as a reference point because i think

02:31:26.240 --> 02:31:31.040
one of the callers brought up that um i think some information that needs to be clarified

02:31:31.840 --> 02:31:37.280
but yes we can do that as well um member ask about thank you and i don't want to you know

02:31:37.280 --> 02:31:42.320
restrict our conversation oh but i do want to let you know we are not on point to get out early so

02:31:42.320 --> 02:31:48.400
we're we should try to um you know give direction about what we'd like to have come back to us

02:31:49.120 --> 02:31:59.680
remember go to woods so i just would say i think a more comprehensive discussion is needed

02:32:00.480 --> 02:32:07.120
what i i fear is us piecemealing tweaking one part of the system and then another part of the system

02:32:07.120 --> 02:32:14.480
without looking at the system as a whole so as we look at how to ensure that our english learners

02:32:14.480 --> 02:32:20.560
are receiving the supports they need to make the progress and that our system is supporting that

02:32:21.120 --> 02:32:27.600
and supporting lea's i think again we need to look at the system as a whole once we have the

02:32:27.600 --> 02:32:34.560
performance level grid in place for 2023 that will help complete part of the picture

02:32:35.440 --> 02:32:41.920
and then go into a deeper discussion and the other aspect as president darling hammon

02:32:42.720 --> 02:32:48.880
acknowledged is us really looking at the intent of our system at the very beginning we were trying

02:32:48.880 --> 02:32:57.040
to have a system that was one fold meaning meets both the need of the state and the federal as we

02:32:57.040 --> 02:33:02.960
start looking at different areas i think it's part of the board's responsibility to discuss is

02:33:02.960 --> 02:33:11.040
that still the direction that we want to convey for our students in our state and again with

02:33:11.040 --> 02:33:16.400
the indicators do they all follow the same methodology are there certain indicators that

02:33:16.400 --> 02:33:21.360
should follow a different methodology large conversations definitely not to be had today

02:33:21.920 --> 02:33:26.800
but again i just encourage all of us to not piecemeal what we're doing but to

02:33:26.800 --> 02:33:31.840
have a very comprehensive conversation looking at all pieces at the time in the future

02:33:33.040 --> 02:33:39.520
thank you and i think with that um member o'connor do you have a did you want to make a motion

02:33:40.480 --> 02:33:48.160
no i can make a comment on a motion like a very quick comment in a motion

02:33:48.160 --> 02:33:54.320
okay um just thinking about the um very thinking of what you said about piecemeal

02:33:55.200 --> 02:34:02.160
there's lots of places that we have data about how students and schools are doing that serves

02:34:02.160 --> 02:34:11.200
for accountability and i think trying to make sure we're not putting everything in one place and

02:34:11.440 --> 02:34:14.800
also knowing the breadth of other tools that we have would be useful

02:34:15.840 --> 02:34:22.480
so yeah anyway all right i'll talk about that one later and my motion is to

02:34:25.280 --> 02:34:28.800
um recommendation we probably should put the recommendation back up

02:34:28.800 --> 02:34:31.440
yeah if you put the recommendation up i'd be happy to make it

02:34:42.560 --> 02:34:46.400
board president as we're putting the recommendation back up i just wanted to say i

02:34:46.400 --> 02:34:52.560
appreciate the idea of being thoughtful about this because it is from a district's perspective

02:34:52.560 --> 02:34:58.960
important that we don't ping pong but i maybe would suggest even another study session like

02:34:58.960 --> 02:35:05.360
we did yesterday i think this is very nuanced and study session you know on this accountability

02:35:05.360 --> 02:35:11.680
set of questions is very uh very good idea i think it would be very helpful to all of us

02:35:11.680 --> 02:35:19.920
to have that study session on the lpis and also um so what before we vote what is going forward

02:35:19.920 --> 02:35:27.120
on the science icon are we going to um revisit that in our next that would be a conversation

02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:33.680
for later we we don't have the data we would normally use to put an icon yet so we have time

02:35:33.680 --> 02:35:42.000
to think about you know how that will appear when we have the data okay can can i actually

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:48.480
sneak in one other comment or question just related to the school climate um conversation i

02:35:48.480 --> 02:35:55.760
i had raised previously the possibility of whether um examples could be brought forward as part of the

02:35:55.760 --> 02:36:02.480
um sort of work in between now and september of looking at the age cohort of tk to five

02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:07.920
which is the largest of six grades as compared to three or four for middle or high school

02:36:08.480 --> 02:36:16.240
of even highlighting any sort of best practices for incorporating tk to three as distinct from

02:36:16.240 --> 02:36:21.520
relying exclusively on fifth graders as the survey climate um this doesn't require a change

02:36:21.520 --> 02:36:26.720
and we are also going to take up school climate in the next item right okay i thought we were

02:36:26.720 --> 02:36:36.000
doing both okay the recommendation slide is is is up on my screen is it number 80

02:36:36.080 --> 02:36:40.720
um yes it's number 80 all right i got it's up on my screen too

02:36:47.920 --> 02:36:51.040
so i'd like to move that we

02:36:55.760 --> 02:36:59.120
um yeah what it says there i would like to move

02:37:00.080 --> 02:37:07.040
what she said that we actually have already provided guidance yeah that's why i'm not sure

02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:14.880
what i'm that we are not taking any additional action yeah do we even need a motion my first

02:37:14.960 --> 02:37:16.640
motion i'm failing

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:33.120
why don't we move to accept okay i would like to move that we accept the work plan proposed to us

02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:42.640
by the department of education with the guidance provided is there a second for that motion

02:37:43.520 --> 02:37:51.840
thank you very much uh all how do you want to do the vote uh kim dick do we do do we do a

02:37:51.840 --> 02:37:55.760
roll call vote or we just could raise our hands now that we're in person okay all in favor say

02:37:55.760 --> 02:38:03.200
aye and raise your hand aye any opposed any abstentions all right the motion passes thank you

02:38:05.120 --> 02:38:11.600
so uh because we are going to try to you know accelerate our progress we're going to do some

02:38:13.040 --> 02:38:19.120
agenda recovery i'm going to suggest that those who need a break and i'm sure everybody is going

02:38:19.120 --> 02:38:23.920
to need a break at some point please take it as you need it and we're going to proceed ahead

02:38:24.960 --> 02:38:31.920
and item four is the developing an integrated local state and federal accountability and

02:38:31.920 --> 02:38:38.480
continuous improvement system and its recommended action require regarding the local indicator

02:38:38.480 --> 02:38:44.000
self-reflection tool for priority six cd recommends that we approve the proposed

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:49.920
revisions to the local indicator self-reflection tool and that we provide further guidance on

02:38:49.920 --> 02:38:56.400
these recommendations and this item will be presented by will McGee i will good to see you

02:38:57.840 --> 02:39:04.080
please begin when you're ready i am gonna hand the gavel at some point to my vice chair so that

02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:11.760
i will take one of those breaks and we apologize for the fact that you will have a moving crew

02:39:11.760 --> 02:39:17.360
here no no worries and we understand totally so thank you for the introduction and good morning

02:39:17.360 --> 02:39:22.880
president darling hammon vice president glubberwood state board of education chief deputy officer

02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:28.560
nicely staff and community my name is william mcgee and i am the division director for the

02:39:28.560 --> 02:39:36.000
student achievement and support division and so we will give you all a brief overview of the item

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:42.560
today the background on the development of the priority six self-reflection tool summary of the

02:39:42.560 --> 02:39:49.200
recommendations and then comparison of the current tool prompts and proposed tool prompts and then

02:39:49.200 --> 02:39:57.840
recommendations of next steps so quick background we were before you all in january of this year

02:39:58.560 --> 02:40:03.680
talking about the item and we received information that provided the state board with

02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:09.440
the background on the history of the priority six school climate tool based on the discussion at

02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:16.400
the january meeting we revise a priority six climate self-reflection tool for use of the

02:40:16.400 --> 02:40:24.080
beginning in the 2324 school year and so i'm excited to welcome back one of our administrators

02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:30.160
mr dr strong who will talk to us about the recommendations of the changes and information

02:40:33.120 --> 02:40:38.480
thank you director mcgee my name is joshua strong i'm the administrator of the local

02:40:38.480 --> 02:40:43.520
agency system support office here at the california department of education president

02:40:43.520 --> 02:40:48.800
harling hammon board member nicely or chief deputy nicely and board members it's a pleasure

02:40:48.800 --> 02:40:55.200
to be with you today so in terms of summary of the recommended changes the recommended

02:40:55.200 --> 02:41:03.040
changes are being provided to you in attachment two of the item the current item as it as the

02:41:03.040 --> 02:41:08.960
current self-reflection tool as it stands is attachment one for comparison purposes but just

02:41:08.960 --> 02:41:16.160
to provide you with an overview of the recommended changes first is to require leas to conduct the

02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:21.920
school climate survey on an annual basis as opposed to every other year second to require

02:41:21.920 --> 02:41:28.800
that the survey the report of the survey data be disaggregated by student group those would be the

02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:35.120
student groups that are required within education code section 52052 the ones that are used within

02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:42.080
the dashboard and our accountability reporting as well as calpads data thirdly to add an

02:41:42.080 --> 02:41:48.240
introductory section within the self-reflection tool itself that provides a description of the

02:41:48.240 --> 02:41:54.560
importance of school climate the research in support of school climate and the needs to use

02:41:54.560 --> 02:42:02.640
current school climate data to inform comprehensive planning continuing on the fourth change that we're

02:42:02.640 --> 02:42:10.480
recommending is to add instructions that provide lea's local educational agencies with clarified

02:42:10.480 --> 02:42:17.040
guidance on how they're to address the narrative portions and then the most

02:42:19.120 --> 02:42:26.240
probably the the biggest overall of the updates is related to the narrative prompts whereas before

02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:31.840
there was one narrative prompt that was broken in that that had three components

02:42:32.160 --> 02:42:41.760
use data use and and meaning we're proposing we're recommending to break those narratives

02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:49.600
into three separate prompts each of which would be responded to by lea's the first of those prompts

02:42:49.600 --> 02:42:55.520
would be to describe the local data including disaggregating the data by student group the

02:42:55.520 --> 02:43:01.600
second would be to report key learnings including identified needs and areas of strength and the

02:43:01.600 --> 02:43:07.520
third would be to describe the changes needed to address local needs what we want to do at this

02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:14.000
point in time is take you through a brief look at those three particular prompts and compare

02:43:14.560 --> 02:43:21.520
the current version to the proposed version so that you can see the differences so in the

02:43:21.520 --> 02:43:27.040
current self-reflection tool under the data component the current requirement is to reflect

02:43:27.040 --> 02:43:33.680
on key learnings from the survey results and share what the lea learned the proposed revision

02:43:33.680 --> 02:43:39.840
to that you can see is more much more substantial describe the local school climate data survey data

02:43:39.840 --> 02:43:45.760
including data disaggregated by student groups lea's using surveys that provide an overall score

02:43:45.760 --> 02:43:51.920
such as the california healthy kids survey are encouraged to report that disaggregated

02:43:51.920 --> 02:43:59.440
student group data as well as the overall student score and then responses lea's are also

02:43:59.440 --> 02:44:06.960
encouraged to include an analysis of the subset of specific items on a local survey and additional

02:44:06.960 --> 02:44:12.400
data collection tools that are particularly relevant to school climate and conditions

02:44:13.040 --> 02:44:20.000
so pointing lea's towards those school climate and conditions piece within this data analysis

02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:27.920
secondly within the meaning currently the meaning asks what did the disaggregated survey results

02:44:27.920 --> 02:44:34.960
if applicable and other data collection methods reveal about schools in the lea such as areas

02:44:34.960 --> 02:44:42.400
of strength or growth challenges and barriers the proposal that we're we're bringing to you today

02:44:43.360 --> 02:44:46.960
the recommendation that we're bringing to you today for adoption

02:44:49.120 --> 02:44:55.920
is as follows describe key learnings including identified needs areas of strength and what the

02:44:55.920 --> 02:45:02.400
data reveals about schools in the lea determined through the analysis of data described in prompt

02:45:02.400 --> 02:45:08.400
one including the data disaggregated by student group i do want to specifically point out to the

02:45:08.400 --> 02:45:17.440
board that on this slide we're proposing to include a specific clause related to schools

02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:26.560
in the lea which the current tool includes but the draft that you have in attachment to

02:45:27.120 --> 02:45:32.560
did not include that's taking into account feedback that we heard from some of our educational

02:45:32.560 --> 02:45:39.520
partners as part of input we want to ensure that we're not only looking at student groups

02:45:39.520 --> 02:45:45.120
but we're also ensuring that there's comparability between schools when we're looking at that school

02:45:45.120 --> 02:45:51.920
climate data so that the full picture of that school climate data is is being looked at and

02:45:51.920 --> 02:45:59.360
analyzed by the lea so we want to ensure that that data revealed about schools in the lea is included

02:45:59.360 --> 02:46:06.800
in that self-reflection tool third the use in the current self-reflection tool

02:46:07.680 --> 02:46:14.560
the use is what revisions decisions or actions has or will the lea implement in response

02:46:14.560 --> 02:46:20.320
to the results of for continuous improvement purposes why have you already implemented acts

02:46:20.320 --> 02:46:24.000
if you've already implemented actions did you see the results you were seeking

02:46:24.960 --> 02:46:32.560
the revised what we're proposing as the revision is describe any changes to existing plans

02:46:32.560 --> 02:46:38.480
policies or procedures that the lea determines necessary in order to address areas of need

02:46:38.480 --> 02:46:44.160
identified through the analysis of local data and the identification of key learnings

02:46:44.720 --> 02:46:51.920
include any revisions decisions or actions the lea has or will implement for continuous

02:46:52.000 --> 02:47:01.120
improvement purposes and and seeking to really hone in on not just the improvements that are

02:47:01.120 --> 02:47:09.040
being made for continuous improvement purposes but within plans procedures policies and how that

02:47:09.040 --> 02:47:17.360
overall analysis is informing the lea's decision making across the board at this

02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:22.320
point i'll turn it back over to director mcgee in order to present the recommendation

02:47:24.400 --> 02:47:26.480
thank you josh for that concise information

02:47:29.120 --> 02:47:34.960
and so again board with that information and the feedback that we received from you all in the

02:47:34.960 --> 02:47:42.160
community the revised recommendation is as follows beginning with the 23-24 school year the cd

02:47:42.160 --> 02:47:48.960
recommends that the state board of education approve the proposed revisions excuse me

02:47:48.960 --> 02:47:54.000
approve the repose revisions to the local indicator self-reflection tool for priority six

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:59.680
school climate additionally the cd recommends that the state board of education provide further

02:47:59.680 --> 02:48:04.880
guidance on these recommendations and take additional action as deemed necessary and

02:48:04.880 --> 02:48:11.520
appropriate so the next steps as well we are working with the comprehensive center to design

02:48:11.520 --> 02:48:17.520
a process to explore the possibility of a small subset of standardized questions that can be

02:48:17.520 --> 02:48:24.000
implemented per you all's desire and the community's desire and then additional details will be

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:28.800
available upcoming and will provide information via memos and regular updates to the board

02:48:29.440 --> 02:48:32.640
and then with that said president darling hammon will turn it over to you

02:48:35.600 --> 02:48:40.880
and i'm going to ask vice president clever woods if she has any comments as early as on

02:48:41.680 --> 02:48:49.040
thank you and i'd like to just thank director mcgee and the department for being responsive

02:48:49.040 --> 02:48:53.840
to the comments that were made at earlier board meetings around this particular item

02:48:53.840 --> 02:49:02.080
and lastly just to say we know that the school climate survey for this particular local indicator

02:49:02.080 --> 02:49:09.040
is so critical to performance that students make on the state indicators we were just talking about

02:49:09.040 --> 02:49:13.520
chronic absenteeism and how students feel connected to school and how they feel about

02:49:13.520 --> 02:49:19.440
the conditions at school impact if they come or not which impact the others so again thank

02:49:19.440 --> 02:49:25.200
you so very much for these revisions and i turn it back over to you president darling hammon

02:49:25.200 --> 02:49:32.160
thank you and i want to ask that we put the public comment slide up so that we can get folks into the

02:49:32.160 --> 02:49:37.840
queue if they are going to call in members of the public who want to provide comment on this item

02:49:37.840 --> 02:49:42.960
can do so in person or by calling the telephone number and using the access code provided on the

02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:50.160
slide that is shown now and i just want to plus one to vice president global woods comments about

02:49:50.160 --> 02:49:56.640

02:50:45.680 --> 02:50:48.720
good morning caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one

02:50:48.720 --> 02:50:50.000
minute your time starts now

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
now

02:50:52.800 --> 02:50:56.880
good morning madam president board members again my name is dr fabiana naranjo gonzalez and i'm

02:50:56.880 --> 02:51:01.440
calling on behalf of los angeles unified school district we are grateful for the ongoing improvements

02:51:01.440 --> 02:51:05.040
in school climate indicator we have always administered the survey annually and have

02:51:05.040 --> 02:51:10.560
disaggregated survey results since 2019 and have posted them in publicly accessible dashboard

02:51:11.120 --> 02:51:15.360
we have preliminary concerns about the possibility of standardizing the survey items that would be

02:51:15.360 --> 02:51:21.120
used by all leas as cd staff continues to explore what the process for developing these items will

02:51:21.120 --> 02:51:24.880
be los angeles unified staff welcomes the opportunity to be a part of the conversation

02:51:24.880 --> 02:51:28.800
to help inform the outcome we'd like to share a perspective on the total number of questions

02:51:28.800 --> 02:51:33.120
that may be added to ensure it will not result in survey fatigue the types of questions since

02:51:33.120 --> 02:51:37.840
we have reservations about more open-ended qualitative questions rather than quantitative

02:51:37.840 --> 02:51:42.000
and how these standardized questions would resemble the existing questions and efforts

02:51:42.080 --> 02:51:46.160
already being administered by our district we expect the concerns in many of these questions

02:51:46.160 --> 02:51:50.160
we have will be resolved and answered over the coming months as this process continues to move

02:51:50.160 --> 02:51:55.200
forward and we look forward to being part of these ongoing discussions thank you thank you

02:51:55.200 --> 02:51:58.800
next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time starts

02:51:58.800 --> 02:52:07.120
now good morning patty Herrera on behalf of the association of california school administrators

02:52:07.120 --> 02:52:12.400
axel supports cde's recommendations and believes the edits will help lea's better understand

02:52:12.400 --> 02:52:17.680
where their strengths and weaknesses are thereby creating a sustainable positive school climate

02:52:17.680 --> 02:52:22.720
that fosters student success if the state were to explore the development or standardized questions

02:52:22.720 --> 02:52:27.920
however axel would respectfully request to be part of the conversation we believe that it is

02:52:27.920 --> 02:52:32.960
important to include the input of practitioners to administer these surveys interact and interact

02:52:32.960 --> 02:52:37.120
directly with students and their families furthermore as the state continues to make

02:52:37.120 --> 02:52:42.000
edits we would ask the state remain cognizant that there is a cost to utilize the survey

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:47.360
instruments and the and any adjustments to them thank you thank you next caller please

02:52:47.360 --> 02:52:50.480
state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time starts now

02:52:50.480 --> 02:53:04.560
good morning again board members this is luz guillen with public advocates

02:53:07.120 --> 02:53:11.600
i want to appreciate the very quick turnaround of this item from the february board meeting

02:53:12.560 --> 02:53:16.560
and especially the making the changes around the administration of the test from

02:53:17.200 --> 02:53:24.560
every year to every year from every other year and also for making the change today

02:53:25.200 --> 02:53:31.520
on the disaggregation of school level data we still have concerns though about some of the

02:53:31.520 --> 02:53:37.040
other language in which we believe is still too permissive so for example in the introduction

02:53:37.600 --> 02:53:43.440
yes the measurement of school climate provides lea's with critical data that can be used to track

02:53:43.440 --> 02:53:51.280
progress it should be used to track progress and also in prompt one lea's using surveys that

02:53:51.280 --> 02:53:59.920
provide an overall score are encouraged to report the score and they may include an analysis of a

02:53:59.920 --> 02:54:06.160
subset of specific items we think this language should be strengthened to require that they report

02:54:06.160 --> 02:54:11.600
the overall score thank you thank you next caller please state your name and affiliation for the

02:54:11.600 --> 02:54:13.520
record you have one minute your time starts now

02:54:16.640 --> 02:54:20.640
good morning president darling hannan members of the board this is lindsey tornatory calling

02:54:20.640 --> 02:54:25.600
on behalf of the california county superintendents express appreciation to william and josh for your

02:54:25.600 --> 02:54:30.880
presentation and work to ensure students and staff have voice in ensuring their schools a safe place

02:54:30.880 --> 02:54:35.680
arguably the most important indicator we use to measure our school success we would like to express

02:54:35.680 --> 02:54:40.800
our support to the proposed edits to the lea self-reflection tool and also again express

02:54:40.800 --> 02:54:46.480
appreciation to the board and cd for continuing to honor the local control flexibilities for lea's

02:54:46.480 --> 02:54:52.400
to choose the tool that makes most sense for their unique communities also if the standardized items

02:54:52.400 --> 02:54:58.080
are explored we request to be a part of this process thank you thank you next caller please

02:54:58.080 --> 02:55:01.360
state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time starts now

02:55:04.560 --> 02:55:08.720
hi this is robert mandolin from children now i wanted to thank the board for

02:55:09.440 --> 02:55:15.200
raise the deep dive that you did in january and following up so rapidly with these changes to the

02:55:15.200 --> 02:55:22.240
tool and specifically for making the adjustments based upon feedback to add the school sub sub

02:55:22.240 --> 02:55:29.200
analysis we look forward to continuing to make progress towards identifying standardized questions

02:55:29.760 --> 02:55:34.240
a subset of standardized questions that can be included on all surveys we think that will be

02:55:34.240 --> 02:55:42.160
really critical and being able to benchmark school climate against other schools and look

02:55:42.160 --> 02:55:48.640
forward to working with staff as as that work continues thank you thank you next caller please

02:55:48.640 --> 02:55:51.680

02:55:59.040 --> 02:56:03.600
want to echo the appreciation for the work of staff and the board in turning this around so

02:56:03.600 --> 02:56:07.600
quickly we're really thrilled with the changes that have been made we're particularly supportive

02:56:07.600 --> 02:56:12.800
of increasing the required cadence of survey administration from every two years to annually

02:56:12.800 --> 02:56:19.200
and we appreciate the the quick response on the need for school level desegregation we also are

02:56:19.200 --> 02:56:24.480
really eager to learn more about the process in developing the possibility of implementing a small

02:56:24.480 --> 02:56:30.320
set of standardized survey questions as we shared previously meaningful accountability for improving

02:56:30.320 --> 02:56:34.800
school climate for students requires that lea's analyze and report their climate data in

02:56:34.800 --> 02:56:39.440
standardized ways and even more importantly that they use standardized surveys or at least

02:56:39.440 --> 02:56:44.000
a set of standardized questions and we really appreciate the board's leadership on this

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:49.600
and we hope to also be included in the process our educators are very they they share

02:56:50.480 --> 02:56:54.800
turnatory's idea that this is one of the most important measures in school performance and hope

02:56:54.800 --> 02:56:59.680
to be a part of it so thank you thank you next caller please state your name and affiliation for

02:56:59.680 --> 02:57:01.600
the record you have one minute your time starts now

02:57:05.600 --> 02:57:09.680
good morning again president darlin hammon and members of the board angelina gatera is

02:57:09.680 --> 02:57:15.120
representing the alley county office of ed lego supports the cde recommendation for changes to

02:57:15.120 --> 02:57:20.240
the priorities six school climate self-reflection tool and appreciates the maintenance of flexibility

02:57:20.240 --> 02:57:23.920
so that ali may continue to choose which tools that meet their unique needs

02:57:23.920 --> 02:57:33.280
and that concludes public comment for item number four thank you very much

02:57:34.400 --> 02:57:39.920
we are very grateful to the staff for getting us to this point and appreciate all of the public

02:57:39.920 --> 02:57:44.000
comment is there any more discussion

02:57:44.640 --> 02:57:51.760
so i just wanted to add on to the next slide which i think is 13

02:57:51.760 --> 02:57:56.400
um certainly also actually let me start by saying thank you to director mcgee for the

02:57:56.400 --> 02:58:01.520
presentation and also appreciation for the move towards annual and disaggregated school

02:58:01.520 --> 02:58:07.600
and student group data as we think about sort of the next steps in your work with the comprehensive

02:58:07.600 --> 02:58:13.920
center and i just wanted to add on to the next slide which i think is 13

02:58:14.560 --> 02:58:23.040
if there's the potential to highlight how some of the tk3 tk2 districts are actually looking at

02:58:23.040 --> 02:58:29.280
the school climate work for the younger ages i think that that's a really streamlined way

02:58:29.280 --> 02:58:34.400
to actually incorporate how to do this for districts that may not be doing it currently

02:58:34.400 --> 02:58:38.800
so it's it's more looking forward but otherwise i'm very supportive of the motion

02:58:39.360 --> 02:58:43.200
do we have a motion

02:58:46.560 --> 02:58:51.680

to participate on a national virtual panel examining the role of civic seals and reaffirming

03:00:51.200 --> 03:00:56.640
the civic mission of schools superintendent thurman and our civics team at the cde have been

03:00:56.640 --> 03:01:01.840
excited to see the growing attention paid to civic learning and engagement at the statewide

03:01:01.840 --> 03:01:08.400
level in recent years most notably with the passage of assembly bill 24 in 2017 which paved

03:01:08.400 --> 03:01:16.480
the way for development and adoption of statewide criteria for the ssce in september of 2020 we've

03:01:16.480 --> 03:01:24.000
been so excited to see the ssce develop since the 2020-2021 school year the first year the insignias

were available we will share more details about the ssce with you today but first i'd like to

03:01:30.320 --> 03:01:35.120
briefly spotlight a few of the other civic initiatives that the superintendent and the

03:01:35.120 --> 03:01:40.960
cde have been supporting the imab our instruction measurement administration branch continues to

03:01:41.040 --> 03:01:45.840
work with the california court's power of democracy steering committee to promote the

03:01:45.840 --> 03:01:52.080
annual civic learning awards and the popular judges in the classroom program the cde also

03:01:52.080 --> 03:01:58.400
facilitates the annual u.s senate youth scholarship competition a highly competitive program that

03:01:58.400 --> 03:02:04.000
recognizes high school students each year for their exceptional civic leadership and learning

03:02:05.040 --> 03:02:10.400
the cd also promotes voter education and engagement efforts led by the secretary of

03:02:10.400 --> 03:02:16.720
state's office including the california student mock election and high school voter education

03:02:16.720 --> 03:02:24.480
weeks and finally the cde educator excellence and equity division or triple ed is also excited

03:02:24.480 --> 03:02:30.160
to collaborate with california volunteers on the new california serves program which aims to

03:02:30.160 --> 03:02:37.360
increase access to the ssce through high quality service learning you'll hear some more general

03:02:37.360 --> 03:02:40.240
updates about california service program as well today

03:02:44.320 --> 03:02:49.440
we'll begin with a general overview of the ssce as well as some information regarding the current

03:02:49.440 --> 03:02:56.400
status of the ssce implementation and insignia requests i do want to share looking at the screen

03:02:56.400 --> 03:03:02.720
this is a recent graduate from centennial high school in bakersfield current county he earned

03:03:02.720 --> 03:03:09.120
the seal in 2021 through his exceptional civics engagement the student helped pass a board

03:03:09.120 --> 03:03:15.600
resolution to recognize the loris where today in bakersfield city school district he led substance

03:03:15.600 --> 03:03:20.560
abuse prevention programs for middle school students and hosted holocaust survivor talks

03:03:21.200 --> 03:03:22.480
that's what this is all about

03:03:26.480 --> 03:03:31.360
as established by the california department i'm sorry as established by california education code

03:03:31.360 --> 03:03:39.680
sections five one four seven five one four seven zero through five one four seven four in 2017

03:03:39.680 --> 03:03:44.960
the cde and state superintendent of public instruction worked with a variety of educational

03:03:44.960 --> 03:03:52.080
partners to draft statewide criteria to guide local education agencies or leas in awarding

03:03:52.080 --> 03:03:59.040
the ssce to students the state board of education adopted statewide criteria and implementation

03:03:59.040 --> 03:04:06.880
guidance for awarding an ssce in september of 2020 this adoption opened the doors for leas

03:04:06.880 --> 03:04:13.440
to develop and implement local programs to award the ssce to eligible students in their communities

03:04:14.240 --> 03:04:19.600
soon after adoption of the criteria statewide organizational partners began supporting leas

03:04:19.600 --> 03:04:20.640
throughout this process

03:04:25.840 --> 03:04:33.200
and continuing the state the adopted statewide criteria states that students must earn an ssce

03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:39.760
by being engaged in academic work in a productive way demonstrating a competent

03:04:39.760 --> 03:04:45.760
and understanding of united states and california constitutions functions and governance of local

03:04:45.760 --> 03:04:51.040
governments tribal government structures and organizations the role of the citizen

03:04:51.040 --> 03:04:58.000
in the constitutional democracy and democratic principles concepts and processes the picture

03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:01.760
displayed on the screen is an example of what the actual seal looks like

03:05:06.880 --> 03:05:13.200
the adopted statewide criteria continue with participate in one or more informed civic

03:05:13.200 --> 03:05:18.000
engagement projects that address real world real world problems and require students to

03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:25.360
identify and inquire into civic needs or problems consider varied responses take action and reflect

03:05:25.360 --> 03:05:34.000
on efforts it also includes demonstration of civic knowledge skills and dispositions

03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:40.320
through self-reflection and exhibiting character traits that reflect civic mindedness and a

03:05:40.320 --> 03:05:45.680
commitment to to positively impact the classroom school community and or society

03:05:46.880 --> 03:05:52.960
leas may still choose to adopt additional local criteria but nevertheless all students who earn

03:05:52.960 --> 03:06:00.160
an ssce must at minimum meet these five criteria to share more about this work i would now like

03:06:00.160 --> 03:06:04.640
to introduce monique mcwayne she is director of the educator excellence and equity division here

03:06:04.640 --> 03:06:11.440
at cde monique will provide an overview of the ssce implementation since the statewide criteria

03:06:11.440 --> 03:06:18.160
was adopted in fall of 2020 and we'll also talk about updates related to the cal service program

03:06:18.160 --> 03:06:24.560
and the ssce data collection thank you for the the invitation and this opportunity monique i'll turn

03:06:24.560 --> 03:06:34.720
over to you thank you all right so good morning president darlingham and vice president glover

03:06:35.280 --> 03:06:42.240
and um chief deputy nicely and thank you for letting me present today i am monique mcwayne

03:06:42.240 --> 03:06:50.240
as sherald introduced and i have additional details on our state seal of civic engagement

03:06:51.200 --> 03:06:53.440
so i'm going to start with the implementation components

03:06:54.320 --> 03:06:59.440
local educational agencies that choose to offer the state seal of civic engagement are responsible

03:06:59.440 --> 03:07:05.680
for developing their local programming before offering the award to eligible students local

03:07:05.680 --> 03:07:10.960
programming refers to all local resources infrastructure requirements and procedures

03:07:10.960 --> 03:07:17.040
that need to be determined in order for students to earn a state seal of civic engagement this may

03:07:17.040 --> 03:07:22.960
include but is not limited to specific student requirements such as coursework assessments

03:07:22.960 --> 03:07:29.280
civic engagement project guidelines requirements service learning expectations and or reflections

03:07:30.320 --> 03:07:36.320
internal application procedures that students follow to earn apply for and receive the state

03:07:36.320 --> 03:07:44.720
seal insignia and record-keeping procedures at the site school site and the local educational agency

03:07:45.360 --> 03:07:49.200
because these decisions are made locally the requirements and process

03:07:49.200 --> 03:07:52.720
for earning the state seal of civic engagement differ from district to district

03:07:53.280 --> 03:08:00.160
the state seal of civic engagement is an optional opportunity local educational agencies at the

03:08:00.160 --> 03:08:06.080
district or county level must have adopted local state seal of civic engagement programming in

03:08:06.080 --> 03:08:13.440
order for the students to earn the seal students may not apply for an insignia directly from the

03:08:13.440 --> 03:08:24.160
californian department of education all right some data i will now review the data on the state

03:08:24.160 --> 03:08:31.840
seal of civic engagement insignia requests for the 2021-22 school year and the 2020-21 school year

03:08:32.480 --> 03:08:37.520
this data is based on insignia requests submitted by local educational agencies in the spring of

03:08:37.520 --> 03:08:46.080
2021 and 2022 in making these requests lea's or local educational agencies do not identify

03:08:46.080 --> 03:08:53.200
the specific students anticipated to receive the state seal of civic engagement this data is not

03:08:53.200 --> 03:08:59.280
collected via calpats or the californian longitudinal longitudinal public pupil achievement

03:08:59.280 --> 03:09:06.000
data system the table shows data outlining the total number of insignia requests for each year

03:09:06.000 --> 03:09:11.280
the state seal of civic engagement has been available and it breaks down these requests

03:09:11.280 --> 03:09:17.440
based on the development on the document to which they will be affixed so diplomas general

03:09:17.440 --> 03:09:24.160
education development or ged certificates certificates of completion grade 11 transcripts

03:09:24.160 --> 03:09:31.440
or grade 12 transcripts please note that for a 2020-21 school year requests for transcripts

03:09:31.440 --> 03:09:34.960
were not broken down by grade level so we do not have that data on our table

03:09:36.960 --> 03:09:43.920
this data is posted each fall on our state seal of civic engagement webpage and then i would

03:09:43.920 --> 03:09:49.600
i still like to highlight a couple of elements from the data one the total number of insignias

03:09:49.600 --> 03:09:57.760
requested roughly doubled from 2020-21 to 2021-22 the number of the local educational agencies

03:09:57.760 --> 03:10:04.000
also more than doubled from 28 local educational agencies to 65 local educational agencies

03:10:05.280 --> 03:10:17.360
the number of insignia affixed to diplomas rose from 4794 to 8354 comprising an 83 percent

03:10:18.160 --> 03:10:27.200
of total insignia requests for the 2021-22 school year no insignias were affixed to ged

03:10:27.200 --> 03:10:36.800
certificates for 2021-22 while there were six in 2020-21 however the number of insignias

03:10:36.800 --> 03:10:47.520
affixed to certificates of completion rose from seven to 59 1630 insignias were affixed to grade

03:10:47.520 --> 03:10:54.720
level 12 transcripts for the 2021-22 school year and 61 were affixed to grade 11 transcripts

03:10:54.880 --> 03:11:00.880
one of the challenges to earning the state seal of civic engagement in grade 11 is fulfilling

03:11:00.880 --> 03:11:06.800
criterion two which requires students to demonstrate an understanding of the united states

03:11:06.800 --> 03:11:14.560
constitution this is traditionally something students focus on in grade 12 local educational

03:11:14.560 --> 03:11:20.320
agencies continue to develop strategies to help students fulfill the seal criterion two which

03:11:20.320 --> 03:11:24.960
criterion two which also requires a student to demonstrate an understanding of not just the

03:11:24.960 --> 03:11:31.040
california or the united states constitution the california constitution as well as tribal

03:11:31.040 --> 03:11:43.520
systems of government as i mentioned in reference to the statewide state state seal of civic

03:11:43.520 --> 03:11:48.960
engagement insignia data local educational agencies do not identify the specific students

03:11:48.960 --> 03:11:56.240
anticipated to receive the insignia and it is not collected via calpads the state board of education

03:11:57.520 --> 03:12:04.000
also discussed this while reviewing so and adopting the statewide state seal of civic

03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:10.800
engagement criteria and recommendations that the cd and recommended sorry and recommended that the

03:12:10.800 --> 03:12:16.240
california department of education investigate ways to incorporate additional criteria for

03:12:16.320 --> 03:12:22.800
recognizing civic engagement in the college career indicator on the california school dashboard

03:12:25.600 --> 03:12:26.880
okay sorry is that better

03:12:28.800 --> 03:12:36.000
since adoption of the statewide criteria in september 2020 the ed my division the educator

03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:40.560
excellence and equity division has worked internally with the analysis measurement and

03:12:40.560 --> 03:12:45.440
accountability reporting division to facilitate a civic engagement work group

03:12:46.880 --> 03:12:53.040
it met several times in 2020 and 2021 to invest what this possible additional

03:12:53.040 --> 03:12:58.080
criteria may look like and develop recommendations for the incorporation of the civic learning and

03:12:58.080 --> 03:13:05.280
engagement into the college and career indicator internal meeting internal teams are meeting

03:13:05.280 --> 03:13:12.640
periodically to check in the work group reconvened in august 2022 to share updates and review

03:13:12.640 --> 03:13:19.680
statewide state seal of civic engagement data while the re-architecture on calpads continues

03:13:24.320 --> 03:13:31.760
at the county level the 2021-22 school year saw a significant increase in the number of counties

03:13:31.760 --> 03:13:35.680
with local educational agencies that offer the state seal of civic engagement

03:13:36.400 --> 03:13:40.400
11 more counties submitted requests for the first time in 2022

03:13:41.120 --> 03:13:47.440
this is in addition to the 14 counties that requested insignias for both 2021 and 2022

03:13:50.480 --> 03:13:56.800
general trends of course there have been a small number of local decreases in insignias

03:13:56.880 --> 03:14:06.160
requested from 2021 to 2022 however the overall numbers of students earning a seal and the number

03:14:06.160 --> 03:14:11.200
of local educational agencies offering the state seal of civic engagement has increased

03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:17.440
this is especially notable given that the first two years of implementation coincided with the

03:14:17.440 --> 03:14:25.120
covid-19 pandemic and the related school closures those local educational agencies that requested

03:14:25.120 --> 03:14:32.240
insignias in 2021 but reported a decline in students earning the state seal of civic

03:14:32.240 --> 03:14:39.120
engagement in 2022 or did not have students who earned a state seal of civic engagement in 2022

03:14:39.760 --> 03:14:45.120
mostly attributed this to student educator and administrator exhaustion or stress

03:14:47.600 --> 03:14:52.240
staffing shortages at county district and site levels have also created challenges

03:14:52.240 --> 03:14:57.120
in implementing the state seal of civic engagement the map on the right side of

03:14:57.120 --> 03:15:02.160
the screen shows location of insignia requests statewide in 2022

03:15:05.200 --> 03:15:11.920
this is at the school district level you will note that requests are concentrated around los

03:15:11.920 --> 03:15:18.720
angeles san diego as well as the san francisco bay area and sacramento regions this was also

03:15:18.720 --> 03:15:26.320
the case in 2021 it is apparent that rural or otherwise hard to reach regions will require

03:15:26.320 --> 03:15:30.800
additional outreach and support in order to develop local state seal of civic engagement

03:15:30.800 --> 03:15:37.440
programming recent grant funding made available in 2022 budget through the california service

03:15:37.440 --> 03:15:45.760
program may also help regions implement the seal finally there is also a need to refine the process

03:15:45.760 --> 03:15:51.520
by which local educational agencies submit corrections to the requested data or sorry

03:15:51.520 --> 03:15:58.080
the requested insignias statewide and state seal of civic engagement request data is drawn from

03:15:58.080 --> 03:16:06.160
the online insignia request form the alias submit in the spring some local educational agencies were

03:16:06.160 --> 03:16:13.040
reported requesting an excess of insignias in 2020-21 in case additional students ended up

03:16:13.040 --> 03:16:21.040
qualifying this resulted in them asking for fewer this year the state seal of civic engagement

03:16:21.040 --> 03:16:26.800
insignia request form also allows for corrections and local educational agencies are to use that

03:16:26.800 --> 03:16:31.440
form to make the corrections to the insignia requests the form is open through the summer

03:16:31.440 --> 03:16:35.200
however it can be challenging to ensure that all the corrections are submitted

03:16:35.200 --> 03:16:40.080
and we are working on increasing communication before and after insignia requests to address this

03:16:43.760 --> 03:16:51.760
so expanding our view of it california is one of several states that has developed or is developing

03:16:51.760 --> 03:16:57.920
ways to recognize students for civic engagement and learning last year the california department

03:16:57.920 --> 03:17:04.400
of education supported the national council for the social studies in developing some general

03:17:04.400 --> 03:17:10.800
resources to support states seeking to offer civic seals as part of that research the national council

03:17:10.800 --> 03:17:17.360
for the social studies is to track which states offer the civic seals and what those opportunities

03:17:17.360 --> 03:17:26.640
look like california arizona georgia new york and ohio have statewide civic diploma seals for

03:17:26.640 --> 03:17:34.160
qualifying students ohio's is the newest program which is on its pilot year in addition to a

03:17:34.880 --> 03:17:40.880
citizenship seal ohio also allows local educational agencies to develop and offer

03:17:40.880 --> 03:17:46.160
the seal to recognize community service as well as a seal to recognize student

03:17:46.160 --> 03:17:52.400
extracurricular engagement several states recognize schools with active civic programs

03:17:53.440 --> 03:18:00.480
this includes kansas tennessee and illinois arizona appears to be the only state that offers a seal

03:18:00.480 --> 03:18:06.880
to both schools and individual students and each state approaches the civic seals differently

03:18:06.880 --> 03:18:11.360
however most states that offer the civic seal restrict seals to graduating students

03:18:12.000 --> 03:18:17.440
require specific coursework and performance on assessments and instruct students to engage in a

03:18:17.440 --> 03:18:25.040
project and or complete a set of number of service or volunteer hours of the states that all that

03:18:25.120 --> 03:18:31.520
offer seals for individual students california is the only state that allows juniors to earn

03:18:31.520 --> 03:18:37.120
seals that does not factor in grades that does not use a standardized statewide assessment

03:18:43.120 --> 03:18:47.280
i will now move on to share more information related to the local state seal of civic

03:18:47.280 --> 03:18:52.560
engagement implementation including information about the new california service program

03:18:53.360 --> 03:18:59.200
and on this slide there are two students from riverside stem high school explaining a recycling

03:18:59.200 --> 03:19:04.880
program that they developed over three years for their school district and they used this program

03:19:06.000 --> 03:19:08.080
for a state seal of civic engagement

03:19:13.040 --> 03:19:17.360
first i'd like to briefly share how our division approaches the state seal of

03:19:17.360 --> 03:19:21.600
civic engagement implementation throughout the year there's a timeline on of the slide

03:19:22.560 --> 03:19:26.560
after updating the insignia request form and stocking up on the insignias

03:19:27.360 --> 03:19:32.560
we post an online insignia request form for the first two years it was posted in march

03:19:32.560 --> 03:19:38.000
but we were able to post it in february this year division staff then fulfills the request

03:19:38.000 --> 03:19:42.640
throughout spring and into summer and with the majority of the requests being processed in april

03:19:42.640 --> 03:19:48.480
and we're processing insignia requests right now throughout the summer division staff processes

03:19:49.120 --> 03:19:55.440
the insignia request data including requesting the lea smith corrections as needed

03:19:57.040 --> 03:20:00.400
this statewide data spreadsheet is posted onto the

03:20:02.000 --> 03:20:06.400
state seal of civic engagement webpage each fall after corrections are processed

03:20:10.400 --> 03:20:15.600
division staff also supports local state seal of civic engagement implementation throughout the year

03:20:16.560 --> 03:20:22.560
if they provide technical assistance they present on the state seal of civic engagement promote

03:20:22.560 --> 03:20:27.520
resources and opportunities provided by state seal of civic engagement partner organizations

03:20:28.320 --> 03:20:34.400
share information on the state seal of civic engagement to internal and external organizations

03:20:34.400 --> 03:20:39.440
and facilitate internal and ongoing partnership to investigate incorporating the civic learning

03:20:39.440 --> 03:20:41.840
and engagement into the college career indicator

03:20:46.160 --> 03:20:52.400
although students in grade 11 and 12 are eligible to earn a state seal of civic engagement

03:20:53.280 --> 03:20:59.120
a key purpose of the legislation was to create pathways for pupils in elementary and secondary

03:20:59.120 --> 03:21:05.440
schools to become civically engaged in democratic governmental institutions at both at the local

03:21:05.440 --> 03:21:11.920
level the state level and national levels encouraging long-term civic engagement was also

03:21:12.800 --> 03:21:18.160
the theme of a november 2022 civic learning summit which brought together students educators

03:21:18.160 --> 03:21:24.000
administrators lawmakers and the judicial branch to recognize and celebrate bright spots in

03:21:24.960 --> 03:21:31.280
student civic engagement at all levels for example to encourage students to begin this

03:21:31.280 --> 03:21:36.240
process in elementary or middle some local educational agencies are developing pathways

03:21:36.240 --> 03:21:39.280
for students to become civically engaged before reaching high school

03:21:40.400 --> 03:21:45.120
anaheim unified high school district is partnering with feeder elementary school districts

03:21:45.120 --> 03:21:50.720
to facilitate vertical learning to encourage civic learning that begins in kindergarten

03:21:52.720 --> 03:21:58.560
fresno unified school district is implementing the state seal of civic engagement regionally

03:21:58.560 --> 03:22:03.520
with fresno high school as the epicenter that works with middle and elementary schools

03:22:03.520 --> 03:22:10.720
in its region to integrate civic learning opportunities vertically participation in

03:22:10.720 --> 03:22:16.160
fresno unified school districts fresno state bonner award also incentivizes schools to

03:22:16.160 --> 03:22:23.120
encourage students to pursue civic learning in younger grades orange county department of

03:22:23.120 --> 03:22:29.360
education created a civic learning pathways document and slide deck to help support projects

03:22:29.360 --> 03:22:33.920
for students to earn civic learning pathway certificates in elementary and middle schools

03:22:35.280 --> 03:22:39.520
sacramento county office of education is exploring options for awarding local

03:22:40.320 --> 03:22:44.240
intermediate civic engagement seals to elementary and middle school students

03:22:44.800 --> 03:22:48.880
and sacramento county office of education leadership has been openly supportive of

03:22:48.880 --> 03:22:54.800
implementing the state seal of civic engagement locally as a civic experience that starts in

03:22:54.800 --> 03:22:58.480
kindergarten and feeds into programs offered at every school level

03:23:02.880 --> 03:23:08.320
in addition to encouraging long-term civic engagement pathways

03:23:09.360 --> 03:23:14.960
local educational agencies also are also developing programming to support students

03:23:15.760 --> 03:23:22.160
in alternative education settings seeking to earn a state seal of civic engagement i'd like to

03:23:22.160 --> 03:23:27.200
highlight two of those santa clara county office of education and sacramento county office of

education santa clara office of education developed a state seal of civic civic engagement

03:23:34.240 --> 03:23:40.320
implementation toolkit that guides local educational agencies implementing the state seal

03:23:40.320 --> 03:23:45.680
to ensure that no student is excluded from an opportunity to earn a seal based on academic

03:23:45.680 --> 03:23:51.760
ability alternative school setting or unique or unconventional expressions of engagement

03:23:52.480 --> 03:23:57.760

03:24:23.280 --> 03:24:29.360
of education also developed special programs criteria to provide examples for local educational

03:24:29.360 --> 03:24:34.000
agencies to implement the state seal of civic engagement in ways that support all students

03:24:35.520 --> 03:24:40.640
sacramento county has also developed local programming that supports access to the seal

03:24:40.640 --> 03:24:46.800
in alternative education settings this includes developing programs based on what it means for

03:24:46.800 --> 03:24:51.360
students in alternative education programs to earn a seal through learning to navigate

03:24:51.360 --> 03:24:58.160
local work and service systems for instance sacramento city unified school districts local

03:24:58.160 --> 03:25:03.200
criteria includes guidance and specific examples to support students in alternative learning

03:25:03.200 --> 03:25:04.960
programs to work towards a seal

03:25:11.840 --> 03:25:16.400
we are also seeing increased support in for civic learning and engagement in the state

03:25:16.400 --> 03:25:23.840
legislature and the governor's office this became evident with the 2022 education omnibus bill

03:25:23.840 --> 03:25:30.320
which included language to establish the california serves program beginning this

03:25:30.320 --> 03:25:36.400
fiscal year school year this appropriates five million annually to the california department

03:25:36.400 --> 03:25:42.880
of ed to develop and administer the california serves program it's in collaboration with

03:25:42.880 --> 03:25:48.080
california volunteers and it's for purposes of promoting access to effective service learning

03:25:48.080 --> 03:25:53.520
for pupils in grade 12 with the goal of expanding access to the state seal of civic engagement

03:25:53.520 --> 03:25:59.440
through service learning this includes five million dollars annual grant program in which

03:25:59.440 --> 03:26:05.680
eligible eligible local educational agencies may apply for grants to support the implementation

03:26:05.680 --> 03:26:09.440
of the state seal through local local service learning programs

03:26:11.920 --> 03:26:21.360
we posted the request for applications for this program on january 26 2000 oh sorry move my slide

03:26:21.360 --> 03:26:29.920
on january 26 2023 applications are due this friday and we held a webinar for

03:26:30.640 --> 03:26:34.880
local educational agencies that are interested on february 3rd 2023

03:26:37.200 --> 03:26:42.160
following the readers conference for this program we will post the intent award we

03:26:42.160 --> 03:26:49.120
anticipate posting it on april 21st and with the final awards posted on may 12th of this year

03:26:50.080 --> 03:26:54.960
the intent is that this is a pilot year of the grant and it will form the basis of an

03:26:54.960 --> 03:27:00.240
innovative continual program to support equitable access to the state seal of civic engagement

03:27:00.240 --> 03:27:10.160
for eligible california school students moving forward see as we continue with year three of

03:27:10.160 --> 03:27:16.960
the state seal of civic engagement implementation the our division is focusing on the following

03:27:17.040 --> 03:27:22.880
areas improving the accuracy of data provided by local educational agencies and reported

03:27:22.880 --> 03:27:29.200
statewide each fall posting the insignia request form earlier for those students who are graduate

03:27:29.200 --> 03:27:35.920
earlier improving the state seal of civic engagement access in rural areas under served

03:27:35.920 --> 03:27:42.160
areas and for students in alternative education programs and supporting and promoting examples

03:27:42.160 --> 03:27:46.320
of local educational agencies that have implemented civic engagement pathways for

03:27:46.320 --> 03:27:51.680
students in elementary school and middle and also where possible address issues related to

03:27:51.680 --> 03:27:59.440
consistency among the local state seal of civic engagement programs to make it easier to analyze

03:27:59.440 --> 03:28:04.560
from community to community including the quality of local programs and how equitably the students

03:28:04.560 --> 03:28:06.160
are accessing the seal

03:28:11.840 --> 03:28:16.080
we're also exploring the incorporation of the state seal of civic engagement into the college

03:28:16.080 --> 03:28:22.560
and career indicator we continue to work internally to investigate ways to recognize and incorporate

03:28:22.560 --> 03:28:27.360
the state seal of civic engagement into the indicator and is and we're excited to move

03:28:27.360 --> 03:28:32.800
forward with this project in the future we anticipate that the department will also provide

03:28:32.800 --> 03:28:39.200
updates on this project in a future state board of education meeting this year and finally our

03:28:39.200 --> 03:28:43.920
division is also moving forward with implementing and growing the california serves program along

03:28:43.920 --> 03:28:51.600
with the state seal of civic engagement and thank you for inviting us to share this information

03:28:51.600 --> 03:29:02.160
today my colleagues wd superintendent cotton and sarah smith an education programs consultant

03:29:02.160 --> 03:29:06.720
within the educator excellence and equity division are here with me i would like to

03:29:06.720 --> 03:29:12.560
take a moment to acknowledge sarah smith today she leads this program on behalf of the department

03:29:12.560 --> 03:29:18.000
she does an amazing job she's very dedicated to civic engagement and she was recently honored

03:29:18.000 --> 03:29:23.840
by the california council for the social studies for her work highlighted and

03:29:23.840 --> 03:29:26.720
and

03:29:29.120 --> 03:29:33.440
so thank you for the conversation and we're happy to take any questions you have at the appropriate

03:29:33.440 --> 03:29:39.920
time thank you so much monique and sheryl let's put the public comment slide up if we may

03:29:41.600 --> 03:29:47.680
and we'll open the phone line for the public comment queue members of the public who want

03:29:47.680 --> 03:29:53.120
to call in may be so in person or by calling the telephone number and using the access code

03:29:53.120 --> 03:29:57.600
that is on the slide that is shown now and while we're waiting for members of the public

03:29:57.600 --> 03:30:02.560
to call in i want to ask our liaison member yoshimoto terry if she would like to make a

03:30:02.560 --> 03:30:08.320
few comments thank you board president i think the fact that we're one of 10 states

03:30:09.680 --> 03:30:14.960
that have a civic seal is very promising i wanted to make three quick points

03:30:14.960 --> 03:30:25.200
no it's a speaker we have an echo over here the creation of promising practices are exciting

03:30:25.200 --> 03:30:29.360
so thank you for recognizing the county offices and the districts that are doing this work

03:30:31.760 --> 03:30:38.320
which can provide support both for the less urban adjacent districts and also for whom's also for

03:30:38.400 --> 03:30:45.680
students whom traditional instruction hasn't been as effective secondly it's exciting that juniors

03:30:46.880 --> 03:30:50.880
and seniors are eligible for this because students could put it on their resumes in their college

03:30:50.880 --> 03:30:56.880
applications i think that's really important and then lastly i did want to connect the seal

03:30:56.880 --> 03:31:02.400
of civic engagement to yesterday's dream session on assessments there was a lot in the civic

03:31:02.400 --> 03:31:09.040
engagement seal that can really be connected with real life culturally relevant giving back

03:31:09.040 --> 03:31:13.920
to the community and demonstrating civic mindedness so i think for the future that

03:31:13.920 --> 03:31:24.240
might be something for us to explore thank you board president and are there any speakers in

03:31:24.240 --> 03:31:31.280
the room who wanted to give public comment there is no one signed up in the room for public comment

good afternoon this is liz gian with public advocates and also with the lcfs equity coalition

03:32:58.160 --> 03:33:03.520
lcfs equity coalition we really appreciate the work that's been accomplished so far

03:33:04.080 --> 03:33:13.040
and all the information provided to lift up the seal of civic engagement we wanted to just

03:33:13.040 --> 03:33:20.400
emphasize what the staff memo made clear that the original intent of ensuring equitable access for

03:33:20.400 --> 03:33:30.080
all students is not being met currently and i would expect the board to provide direction to

03:33:30.080 --> 03:33:40.400
help the department try to get more lea's involved and especially those that are in

03:33:40.720 --> 03:33:50.320
um uh areas such as rural areas um we also appreciate the lifting this up as a potential

03:33:50.320 --> 03:33:57.120
measure of accountability however until there is student group data on the recipients of this

03:33:57.120 --> 03:34:02.320
field we would be concerned about adding this metric to the college and career indicator

03:34:03.040 --> 03:34:06.720
it seems like there would be a lot of work to do before we get to that point

03:34:07.520 --> 03:34:12.240
thank you thank you next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you

03:34:12.240 --> 03:34:19.920
have one minute your time starts now uh good afternoon i'm huling lee executive director

03:34:19.920 --> 03:34:25.840
for authentic corporation today we appreciate the state board and cd's commitments to this work and

03:34:25.840 --> 03:34:31.760
our collaborations um with cd on this given the equity implications of inconsistent state seal

03:34:31.760 --> 03:34:35.920
civic engagement implementation in the field we would recommend that the state

03:34:35.920 --> 03:34:41.200
one reinstate the civic engagement work group to improve and refine the seal criteria requirements

03:34:41.200 --> 03:34:47.920
based on local promising practices and needs to revise the seal criteria to prioritize the

03:34:47.920 --> 03:34:53.120
civic engagement projects student reflection and evidence with more specificity so these

03:34:53.120 --> 03:34:59.600
requirements are not watered down unintentionally three require not just recommend the lea's meet

03:34:59.600 --> 03:35:07.280
the state baseline state seal criteria and lastly four to use a 10 california certified to provide

03:35:07.280 --> 03:35:13.040
high quality examples and resources as guidance across the state and to determine a process for

03:35:13.040 --> 03:35:18.720

with the remarks of miss liz gianna miss healing lee on on these subjects particularly in terms

03:36:00.080 --> 03:36:08.240
of equitable access schools and local educational associations need strong support strong straight

03:36:08.240 --> 03:36:13.600
support to make civic engagement a reality especially for pathways up to grades 11 and 12

03:36:14.240 --> 03:36:18.320
the numbers that we're talking about thus far in the first few years of implementation are very

03:36:18.320 --> 03:36:24.320
strong very weak and and really in order to have make an impact and make an impact of this critical

03:36:24.320 --> 03:36:30.000

seal of civic engagement getting this bill will allow me to show that not only did i make a

03:37:03.520 --> 03:37:08.160
difference in my school but also in my community as a young student of color through my work at

03:37:08.320 --> 03:37:14.480
toronto's peace mural and how it led to decrease student conflict and brought a sense of belonging

03:37:14.480 --> 03:37:20.320
getting the sale also recognizes the work i've done at cfj and gathering data on issues that

03:37:20.320 --> 03:37:25.120
are important to students and making sure students know they're right students should have more

03:37:25.120 --> 03:37:30.560
opportunities to create projects and also more clarity on qualifications because there are so

03:37:30.560 --> 03:37:36.800
many students that qualify for it but don't know they do we want this state so civic engagement to

03:37:36.800 --> 03:37:42.000
be more accessible to students of color and those income students like myself and get there

03:37:42.560 --> 03:37:46.000

please start your public comment thank you my name is erica hodgin with the civic engagement

03:38:44.480 --> 03:38:49.920
research group at uc riverside i want to thank the board and cde for their commitment to use civic

03:38:49.920 --> 03:38:54.960
engagement and support for the state seal of civic engagement i'm calling to share three

03:38:54.960 --> 03:39:00.240
preliminary findings from a study where we assess the extent to which this new civic initiative is

03:39:00.240 --> 03:39:05.360
accessible throughout the state and how the landscape has changed and to urge the board

03:39:05.360 --> 03:39:11.520
to support district implementation and collect additional data to help us and districts promote

03:39:11.520 --> 03:39:16.960
this kind of high quality civic learning in this study we examined district l caps and mission

03:39:16.960 --> 03:39:22.800
statements and we did the same study in 2020 and then it compared to 2022 and the first finding

03:39:22.800 --> 03:39:27.680
that we see is that civic and democratic goals have increased only slightly in california

03:39:27.680 --> 03:39:33.280
district mission statements and l caps and we also find that there's comparatively less staffing to

03:39:33.280 --> 03:39:38.480
support history social science and civic agendas the fact that many districts have no individuals

03:39:38.480 --> 03:39:43.440
focused specifically on civics or very few in social studies may be constraining implementation

03:39:43.440 --> 03:39:49.520
of the seal the second finding that we've been looking at based on available data is that the

03:39:49.520 --> 03:39:56.720
seal is being adopted by districts of varying sizes but the state's 10 largest largest districts

03:39:56.720 --> 03:40:03.120
only four offer the seal and when we compare the 12th grade population of the districts that have

03:40:03.120 --> 03:40:09.200
adopted the field we found that on average districts are only requesting 11 percent thank

03:40:09.200 --> 03:40:13.600
you your 12th grade population to earn this deal so we urge you to think about collecting

03:40:13.600 --> 03:40:19.600
more data and equity and access around the field thank you that concludes public comment for item

03:40:19.600 --> 03:40:28.320
number five thank you very much this is not an action item it's a information item but if we

03:40:28.320 --> 03:40:34.800
have comments that we want to make for the staff as they move forward this is the time to do that

03:40:34.800 --> 03:40:41.200
yes naomi so thank you so much truly for the work that you've been doing it is so impactful

03:40:41.840 --> 03:40:45.920
so i wanted to make two quick comments first in my own service learning leadership class we

03:40:45.920 --> 03:40:51.840
participate in this thing called a 20-time project which we dedicate 20 percent of our time in class

03:40:51.840 --> 03:40:56.480
towards a passion project similar to those that would count towards the seal and this has been

03:40:56.480 --> 03:41:01.680
wildly successful and so many students want to take this course simply because of this project

03:41:01.680 --> 03:41:07.120
and students have created mental wellness kits sorry taught art classes and re-engaged in hobbies

03:41:07.120 --> 03:41:12.080
that they no longer felt they had time for given rigorous course schedules and other time

03:41:12.080 --> 03:41:18.400
commitments and i believe that when students have autonomy over what we want to dedicate our time

03:41:18.400 --> 03:41:25.600
to and directly impact how we measure success in our project directly kind of parallels to

03:41:25.600 --> 03:41:30.640
member yoshimoto tauri's point of the conversations that we had yesterday about ensuring

03:41:30.640 --> 03:41:36.320
that students are workplace ready so i think that providing examples of successful projects

03:41:36.320 --> 03:41:43.200
for the seal is important so students can get an idea and some guidance of successful projects

03:41:43.200 --> 03:41:49.600
and kind of how to turn their ideas and their passions into tangible product projects and then

03:41:49.600 --> 03:41:54.000
secondly with a different perspective a few student board members from across the state

03:41:54.000 --> 03:41:59.840
have reached out to me about their districts being wary about the seal being used as a tool

03:41:59.840 --> 03:42:07.120
solely to write on college applications or to build a resume rather than its intent which is

03:42:07.120 --> 03:42:12.080
to bolster civic engagement and understanding and really encourage that and so i'm curious

03:42:12.080 --> 03:42:16.400
if there is data about this and the seals effectiveness or if that's just something to

03:42:16.400 --> 03:42:26.640
consider for future updates just want that to share um i think what makes california unique

03:42:26.640 --> 03:42:33.280
is that we do not require gpa we don't require any of those things in order for students to earn

03:42:33.920 --> 03:42:40.640
their civic seal of engagement i think that that's one positive and i i agree with you that the

03:42:40.640 --> 03:42:46.320
focus is on encouraging student learning but one of the the byproducts is also student engagement

03:42:46.320 --> 03:42:51.040
and school climate and making school a more fun and engaging place as you're describing

03:42:51.040 --> 03:42:59.280
with your passion project for students as well thank you yes member mccullin yes thank you for

03:42:59.280 --> 03:43:05.360
the presentation i'm so thankful that you've included tribal students understanding their

03:43:05.360 --> 03:43:10.960
own tribal structures and tribal organizations it's really good it's such a refreshing item

03:43:11.520 --> 03:43:19.680
and overdue i'm reminded just a couple of weeks ago i saw students at a peaceful civic

03:43:21.360 --> 03:43:26.560
protest or to bring attention to the missing and murdered indigenous peoples that was happening

03:43:26.560 --> 03:43:31.760
over at the state capitol just two weeks ago and i saw some high school students as a part of that

03:43:31.760 --> 03:43:37.680
so it's great that they will possibly be acknowledged academically for that involvement

03:43:39.040 --> 03:43:46.000
i also hope that we will be tracking and getting numbers of who's applying and what

03:43:46.000 --> 03:43:51.120
subgroups are applying for this seal also in the future thank you

03:43:53.840 --> 03:44:01.760
any other advice or commentary vice president glover woods thank you just to build off a

03:44:01.760 --> 03:44:07.200
board member mccullin statement i again thank everyone for all that they've done this is just

03:44:07.200 --> 03:44:12.800
a wonderful opportunity for students and i've just strongly encouraged us to look at how we

03:44:12.800 --> 03:44:19.120
can get to some student level data to address the issues of equity that might be in place

03:44:19.120 --> 03:44:25.280
and also to utilize that information to help determine how we can support leas that may not

03:44:25.280 --> 03:44:30.560
be offering these opportunities to students especially if we're going to look at including

03:44:30.560 --> 03:44:36.880
this as one of the criteria on our college career indicator thank you so much for the

03:44:36.880 --> 03:44:41.680
work that's been done and i look forward to future information around this topic thank you

03:44:43.520 --> 03:44:52.080
member holcomb thank you for your presentation today and all the work on this and anything that

03:44:52.080 --> 03:44:59.440
gives member porter the opportunity to share her good work i'm in favor of but i also just

03:44:59.440 --> 03:45:08.000
wanted to build on what vice president glover woods just said about the link between access

03:45:08.000 --> 03:45:14.720
between this program and access and equity from a different angle which is the ways in which

03:45:16.720 --> 03:45:22.160
encouraging and rewarding civic engagement amongst our youth particularly

03:45:23.920 --> 03:45:32.000
in a way that is equitable and really supports some of our vulnerable and disadvantaged

03:45:32.000 --> 03:45:40.000
populations to participate actually is a helps us build the tomorrow that we want so i think

03:45:40.000 --> 03:45:45.440
there's been a lot of talk about how this is good for students to engage in but i think

03:45:46.880 --> 03:45:53.920
remembering to frame this work around that it's good for us as a society to encourage and to reward

03:45:55.120 --> 03:45:58.960
because it's going to help us have more democratic institutions in the future

03:45:59.520 --> 03:46:07.920
is important and i think we know from history that our youth are often where the real solutions

03:46:07.920 --> 03:46:16.320
come from and so i think there's a lot more to be gained by growing this program than for example

03:46:16.320 --> 03:46:24.560
college resumes thank you so much so i think that we're moving toward the place where we can consider

03:46:24.560 --> 03:46:32.480
this as part of the seal of as part of our college career and civic engagement index that will

03:46:33.040 --> 03:46:39.040
encourage people in the field to take it up i think once that is now something that could

03:46:39.040 --> 03:46:44.320
possibly count obviously we've heard a lot about the need to create a support system to figure out

03:46:44.320 --> 03:46:49.840
how to make this a meaningful element and so we're going to look forward to seeing you again soon

03:46:50.720 --> 03:46:57.120
with some of those answers and we just want to applaud keeping the work moving forward thank you

03:46:57.120 --> 03:47:05.760
so much and i'm going to now reopen item two because state superintendent tony thurman is

03:47:05.760 --> 03:47:15.360
here and it is time for his report thank you tony madam president thank you to the members of the

03:47:15.360 --> 03:47:21.920
board madam vice president and i just want to thank our team for the presentation and thinking

03:47:21.920 --> 03:47:27.440
about the more than 10 000 state seals that have been provided in california and it was

03:47:28.640 --> 03:47:34.240
an honor for me to join a conversation with state superintendents from across the nation

03:47:34.240 --> 03:47:38.960
and to be able to say that our state does not require a gpa that we think that the state seal

03:47:38.960 --> 03:47:45.120
should be eligible available to all students and so thank you for your leadership and for

03:47:45.120 --> 03:47:51.280
making it available for all of our students as always i want to start by being in gratitude

03:47:51.280 --> 03:47:58.320
to our teachers and our classified staff and to our students our family members for all that you

03:47:58.320 --> 03:48:03.920
do for our six million students and acknowledge again that it's women's history month and i would

03:48:03.920 --> 03:48:10.080
like to plus one all the things that i heard president darling ham and say about the real

03:48:10.080 --> 03:48:19.040
life mathematicians who for whom which the film hidden figures was created and just acknowledge

03:48:19.040 --> 03:48:24.240
the incredible leaders on this board if you look around we have incredible leaders here

03:48:25.760 --> 03:48:32.320
and it's an honor to serve all of you and just to thank you i'm also reminded about a school

03:48:32.320 --> 03:48:38.560
visit last month to robla elementary school district where i was given the honor to present

03:48:38.560 --> 03:48:47.760
to some students the ruby bridges award and the room was full of many young students who appreciated

03:48:47.760 --> 03:48:55.040
that ruby bridges had to sacrifice so much to make education possible for us all you know being

03:48:55.040 --> 03:49:03.520
escorted by police officers and troopers and just the kind of hate that she experienced and sacrificed

03:49:03.520 --> 03:49:11.840
to ensure that our students would have access to an education with equity and so i'm grateful to

03:49:11.840 --> 03:49:17.840
all who continue to support our students and i'm happy to share just a few reflections from

03:49:18.960 --> 03:49:25.440
my visits again it's national school breakfast week and this week i had the opportunity to spend

03:49:25.440 --> 03:49:32.480
time with the first partner and with the u.s secretary for agriculture

03:49:33.520 --> 03:49:40.960

who's been a trailblazer as we talk about women's history month and at the school a great

03:49:55.680 --> 03:50:01.920
conversation about how we provide healthy nutritious meals to our students as you all know we provide

03:50:01.920 --> 03:50:09.360
universal meals for our students and it was great to see the meals prepared by the staff and students

03:50:09.360 --> 03:50:14.880
and working with farmers and others to make sure that great resources are provided to our schools

03:50:14.880 --> 03:50:22.320
to provide healthy sustenance for our students it is also national school social worker week

03:50:22.320 --> 03:50:28.240
and i want to acknowledge all the school social workers and as take a point of personal privilege

03:50:28.240 --> 03:50:34.160
as a social worker i'm grateful for what you do and i know that later in the agenda you'll hear from

03:50:34.720 --> 03:50:39.520
deputy superintendent zimmer and our team from alameda county office of education some updates

03:50:39.520 --> 03:50:44.880
about community schools and want to welcome them today and and we'll continue the conversation

03:50:44.880 --> 03:50:50.480
about the great work that social workers do and other mental health clinicians do and remind those

03:50:50.480 --> 03:50:55.520
that anyone who wants to become a mental health clinician and work in a school california offers

03:50:55.520 --> 03:51:01.920
a 20 000 grant to do that and we are excited about our ability to support our school staff

03:51:02.720 --> 03:51:10.240
i also this week had the pleasure of participating in a capital visit with students from

03:51:10.960 --> 03:51:17.520
palace verdes peninsula high school the home school of our own trustee naomi porter

03:51:17.520 --> 03:51:23.360
and i saw in action what we see in action here all the time well informed students who are very

03:51:23.360 --> 03:51:31.040
well researched and they came to the capital very focused on how we expand mental health services

03:51:31.040 --> 03:51:35.280
and their perspectives were incredible and i think that we need to do all that we can

03:51:35.840 --> 03:51:42.480
to to follow the suggestions of our students we all know we have a shortage we all know that of

03:51:42.480 --> 03:51:47.520
mental health clinicians and we know that there's still stigma in the world and that we can do more

03:51:47.520 --> 03:51:52.880
to help our students and on that note i'll just mention as i always do that anyone who needs to

03:51:52.880 --> 03:52:01.440
talk to a counselor can do so 24 hours a day seven days a week by texting or calling 9 8 8

03:52:02.160 --> 03:52:09.840

thank you um great to be back um my name is lorraine richards and i'm a classroom teacher

04:00:36.560 --> 04:00:43.200
representing the california teachers association cta would like to express our continued concerns

04:00:43.200 --> 04:00:49.760
with the funding determination process with non-classroom based charters there is a significant

04:00:49.760 --> 04:00:55.840
disconnect with the state level process and it was on display at the february a ccs meeting

04:00:55.840 --> 04:01:01.280
in which some commissioners raised significant concerns regarding the funding determination

04:01:01.280 --> 04:01:08.560
process and the intersection of the authorizer chair walsh expressed it is clear that there is

04:01:08.560 --> 04:01:13.360
still work to be done on the process and the systems and becoming clearer about the charter

04:01:13.360 --> 04:01:20.720
authorization responsibility the these disconnects open the door to bad actors such as the people who

04:01:20.720 --> 04:01:25.920
ran the a3 charters and others who have taken advantage to steal hundreds of millions of

04:01:25.920 --> 04:01:31.600
dollars in public funds cta looks forward to working with cde state board of education and

04:01:31.840 --> 04:01:41.280
ccs to fix this broken process thank you thank you are there any other in-person speakers

04:06:47.440 --> 04:06:55.920
more in the item i i know flying into the atmospheric river this morning i i know that

04:06:56.880 --> 04:07:01.840
while i respect your process in terms of being able to get out and get everyone home safely

04:07:01.840 --> 04:07:11.360
today so there's more information in the item a brief reminder we it's a 4.1 billion dollar

04:07:11.360 --> 04:07:19.120
allocation for planning grants implementation grants to transform and support community schools

04:07:19.200 --> 04:07:27.200
within lea's and and also to provide a robust infrastructure at the county level the regional

04:07:27.200 --> 04:07:34.000
level and the state level to support strong statewide implementation and i think if there's

04:07:34.000 --> 04:07:42.640
a theme that i would have for today's presentation it is that implementation is happening we came a

04:07:42.640 --> 04:07:48.720
year and a half ago with a program we were just launching and i think that we can say today and

04:07:49.280 --> 04:07:56.720
we'll touch on this in his presentation and you'll see it from dr pure wall from from alameda

04:07:56.720 --> 04:08:06.480
county implementation is happening this is taking hold so far you have approved 193 lea's last year

04:08:06.480 --> 04:08:19.360
for planning grants 76 lea's for implementation grants and 458 individual school sites

04:08:20.080 --> 04:08:25.440
38 county offices of education to support grantees in their county a lead technical

04:08:25.440 --> 04:08:32.160

i also want to share that since the update in november our alameda county superintendent of

04:10:06.720 --> 04:10:12.640
schools alice castro has joined us and has been tremendously supportive of the work and the

04:10:12.640 --> 04:10:22.160
transformational vision of the s-tac today i will touch on the topics listed here in the overview

04:10:22.160 --> 04:10:27.120
and i'll be closing with the next steps that are on the horizon for the s-tac

04:10:31.040 --> 04:10:36.560
since we started our work in july we have facilitated seven webinars six communities

04:10:36.560 --> 04:10:44.080
of transformative practice and 27 collective learning spaces all grounded in the california

04:10:44.080 --> 04:10:50.640
community schools framework the webinars designed for grantees educators students families and

04:10:50.640 --> 04:10:56.800
community members have been a space for us to share how to create community schools that are

04:10:56.800 --> 04:11:04.080
racially just relationship centered and foster shared decision making we have also been intentional

04:11:04.080 --> 04:11:10.720
about representing our diverse state by lifting best practices and strategies from practitioners

04:11:10.720 --> 04:11:17.200
who represent our rural communities as well as our tribal communities we have also engaged our

04:11:17.280 --> 04:11:23.520
county offices of education in our communities of transformative practice trying to really identify

04:11:23.520 --> 04:11:29.840
the opportunities for coherence from the grantee levels of the school sites to the lea's as well

04:11:29.840 --> 04:11:35.040
as our county offices of education to really support this transformational implementation of

04:11:35.040 --> 04:11:40.480
programming at our school sites we have encouraged our 31 county offices of educations who have been

04:11:40.480 --> 04:11:45.920
receiving grant allocations to support grantees in their areas to join us in this community of

04:11:45.920 --> 04:11:51.680
transformative practice and also invite all other county offices of education through

04:11:51.680 --> 04:11:55.920
presentations at our california county superintendents meetings as well as our

04:11:55.920 --> 04:12:00.640
curriculum and instruction steering committee meetings that engage leaders from the county

04:12:00.640 --> 04:12:09.280
office of education level in the 27 collective learning spaces as well as our phone calls and

04:12:09.280 --> 04:12:16.080
email support we have been able to really provide more of the targeted and intensive support

04:12:16.080 --> 04:12:20.640
to differentiate the needs that our grantees have on the ground as they are implementing and

04:12:20.640 --> 04:12:31.680
planning community schools we are extremely elated that we have eight partners in this work with us

04:12:31.680 --> 04:12:37.040
along with our phenomenal cde team the eight regional transformational assistance centers that

04:12:37.040 --> 04:12:44.480
have been approved throughout our state we have been engaging with our rtacs we visited each rtac

04:12:44.480 --> 04:12:50.640
in person over the last several months to really strengthen and to begin this relation build

04:12:50.640 --> 04:12:56.800
relationship building process we've been able to really glean and learn about how these regional

04:12:56.800 --> 04:13:02.720
transformational assistance centers have been leads in their counties in their in at the stand

04:13:02.800 --> 04:13:08.000
at the state level to really determine how we're going to be able to maximize that expertise

04:13:08.000 --> 04:13:13.440
as we implement community schools across our state a few notable strengths that we've already

04:13:13.440 --> 04:13:19.920
identified that can really be supportive of this work is rtacs who have who are the state leads

04:13:19.920 --> 04:13:25.680
right now for medic al billing we also have a state regional transformational assistance center

04:13:25.680 --> 04:13:31.280
that is the community engagement initiative lead we also know that one of our county offices of

04:13:31.280 --> 04:13:38.560
education that's an rtac has themselves set up medical clinics across their county that's just

04:13:38.560 --> 04:13:46.320
to name a few we are very excited really trying to just lift the strength and the capacity we have

04:13:46.320 --> 04:13:51.120
to really implement this program to be meaningful student-centered and serving families and

04:13:51.120 --> 04:13:55.920
communities we've also established monthly meetings with these county offices of education

04:13:55.920 --> 04:14:00.080
just to continue the alignment and coherence of ta across our state

04:14:01.280 --> 04:14:06.320
we also find it important to develop a shared understanding among our s tech as well as our

04:14:06.320 --> 04:14:12.560
rtac partners in december we invited our rtac partners to engage in a ucla community school

04:14:12.560 --> 04:14:17.200
study tour where we went through a community school we were led by students as well as

04:14:17.200 --> 04:14:22.480
administrators in learning more about what that community school looked like what the planning

04:14:22.480 --> 04:14:27.520
process was an implementation and how they are continuously learning from the community members

04:14:27.520 --> 04:14:35.120
and students on how to really support the access and success for these students and families

04:14:35.120 --> 04:14:40.560
we're also excited to share that we will be engaging in another shared understanding opportunity

04:14:41.360 --> 04:14:47.840
funded by the actually the the stewart foundation who is getting together other leads

04:14:47.920 --> 04:14:52.960
statewide leads who are focused on secondary programming such as the dual enrollment the

04:14:52.960 --> 04:14:57.200
golden state pathways that have been mentioned as we'll be coming together to really engage

04:14:57.200 --> 04:15:02.640
in a deep learning experience in april and we're very excited to continue that shared understanding

04:15:02.640 --> 04:15:10.480
work now i'm going to switch to our implementation growth chart which as part of our s tech contract

04:15:11.040 --> 04:15:15.840
we were been asked to develop a rubric one thing i want to name that you know we really thought

04:15:15.840 --> 04:15:21.680
about the word rubric and thought gosh how can we really talk about and express that this is you

04:15:21.680 --> 04:15:26.640
know it's not an accountability measure it's this is supposed to be used as a tool so how are we

04:15:26.640 --> 04:15:32.480
using a growth chart to really lift and identify that this is a process implementation is going

04:15:32.480 --> 04:15:38.720
to take time it's going to be iterative so in response to our grantees that we have heard from

04:15:38.720 --> 04:15:43.840
through our collective learning space through our emails and our phone calls we have created a

04:15:43.840 --> 04:15:48.160
growth chart that's very soon about to be released which is tethered in the values of

04:15:48.160 --> 04:15:53.120
the california community schools framework but it also highlights this california way

04:15:53.120 --> 04:16:00.240
and when i share that i want to just really lift the multitude of investments that are coming our

04:16:00.240 --> 04:16:06.400
way in our schools in our lea's and how can we really think about sustainability and implementation

04:16:06.400 --> 04:16:11.920
in this new california way we have so many opportunities to bring together funding and

04:16:11.920 --> 04:16:20.160
investments to support this this meaningful work additionally we acknowledge that we are

04:16:20.160 --> 04:16:25.120
providing chronological guidance while recognizing this non-linear nature of implementation

04:16:25.680 --> 04:16:30.400
really wanting to meet folks where they at as grantees and planning and implementation grads

04:16:30.400 --> 04:16:36.560
so this growth chart actually includes resources and tools such as self-assessments and they ask

04:16:36.560 --> 04:16:42.400
questions related to for example health care services that are going to be you know provided

04:16:42.400 --> 04:16:48.320
for students and what access they have also summer learning experiences what's being put in place for

04:16:48.320 --> 04:16:54.320
students in the summer and also other aspects such as other student services that families

04:16:54.320 --> 04:17:00.080
and students may need so the self-assessments will help to really shape and inform the needs

04:17:00.080 --> 04:17:07.120
for implementing implementing community schools we have also received feedback from our advisory

04:17:07.120 --> 04:17:13.200
board our regional transformational assistant centers as well as the cd our cd partners to

04:17:13.200 --> 04:17:19.600
really adjust and iterate this process of creating this growth chart we as we release it we are

04:17:19.600 --> 04:17:26.000
wanting the community to engage and to provide us feedback as they are using this tool as a

04:17:26.000 --> 04:17:33.040
resource to design their community schools the implementation growth chart is tethered to the

04:17:33.040 --> 04:17:39.120
four overarching values that you see here that operate operationalize the california community

04:17:39.120 --> 04:17:46.320
schools framework classroom community connections really emphasizing emphasizing that we are

04:17:46.320 --> 04:17:52.960
continuously linking classroom instruction to the broader community and that the school is rooted

04:17:52.960 --> 04:17:59.280
in the assets of the students families educators and local community members racially just

04:17:59.280 --> 04:18:04.080
relationship centered spaces are another value that we want to lift in this growth chart

04:18:04.080 --> 04:18:10.160
and that's really spotlighting the authentic the importance of authentically valuing diverse

04:18:10.160 --> 04:18:16.800
cultures perspectives and strengths in our communities co-ownership really speaks to the

04:18:17.440 --> 04:18:24.320
and the grounding in the belief that schools belong to all of us students educators families

04:18:24.320 --> 04:18:29.600
community members and that these spaces are democratic recognizing and building towards

04:18:29.600 --> 04:18:36.640
shared ownership and deep engagement and finally a focus on continuous improvement can't stress

04:18:36.640 --> 04:18:41.840
this enough we are going to iterate we are going to listen and we are going to continue to try to

04:18:41.840 --> 04:18:49.920
meet the needs of our students and our families in our communities the growth chart contains nine

04:18:49.920 --> 04:18:56.400
capacity building strategies that are actually within three phases of growth and development

04:18:56.400 --> 04:19:02.880
visioning engaging and transforming and these capacity building strategies are associated

04:19:02.880 --> 04:19:08.880
activities that build the structural and organizational capacity for collective efficacy

04:19:08.960 --> 04:19:13.760
and action in meeting the shared goals and values listed in the previous slide

04:19:17.280 --> 04:19:22.480
now i'll be moving on to an implementation plan template that was recently released to the field

04:19:23.360 --> 04:19:30.480
this implementation plan template was derived from the implementation growth chart this has been a

04:19:30.480 --> 04:19:37.520
very strong collaboration between our s tech and our cde partners we had a lot of back and forth

04:19:37.520 --> 04:19:43.440
and how to meet the needs of our grantees it is in response also to the cohort to community schools

04:19:43.440 --> 04:19:48.640
partnership program implementation grant rfa requirement which now requires that each site

04:19:48.640 --> 04:19:54.080
include an implementation plan so we really wanted to provide this trans this ta to support

04:19:54.080 --> 04:19:59.600
applicants in wanting to really engage in this work moving forward we have also as an s tech

04:19:59.600 --> 04:20:05.520
facilitated two webinars in the last two weeks receiving you know many a lot of great feedback

04:20:05.520 --> 04:20:09.920
and support around how this tool is going to help them with their applications and that those

04:20:09.920 --> 04:20:17.440
webinars really focused on the purpose and use of this template next i'm excited to share that we

04:20:17.440 --> 04:20:23.680
have i mean we are engaging this part process as an s tech around transformation partner deep dive

04:20:23.680 --> 04:20:30.480
sites very excited and and really the purpose of these deep dive sites are a way for our team to

04:20:30.480 --> 04:20:38.880
partner with three ccspp implementation grantees over a period of time to really capture a vertical

04:20:38.880 --> 04:20:46.560
slice of the broader system from the school the district the county and the arctic we're really

04:20:46.560 --> 04:20:53.680
looking to understand implementation from a systems perspective and build collective capacity to learn

04:20:53.680 --> 04:21:00.400
improve and transform and really support grantees across the state we plan on doing this by

04:21:00.400 --> 04:21:05.440
collaborating at each level of these deep dive sites from the site to the county office to the

04:21:05.440 --> 04:21:12.160
arctic and really building this understanding and shared understanding of what implementation

04:21:12.160 --> 04:21:18.880
looks like in response to what we're hearing in asset mapping gap analysis through our advisory

04:21:18.880 --> 04:21:26.320
board and steering committees and also finding those nuggets of how do we think about sustainability

04:21:26.320 --> 04:21:31.520
and how do we leverage the investments of several of the allied reforms that we have here and how do

04:21:31.520 --> 04:21:40.240
we do this in our california way very excited to now announce that over the past four months

04:21:40.240 --> 04:21:46.240
we have analyzed the cohort one implementation grantee abstracts coded them identified them for

04:21:46.240 --> 04:21:51.200
evidence of the california community schools framework really thinking about whole child

04:21:51.200 --> 04:21:56.480
principles of learning sustainability and collaborative leadership and we've conducted

04:21:56.480 --> 04:22:02.640
interviews with six finalists that we selected based on this these analysis of abstracts and

04:22:02.640 --> 04:22:07.520
after much deliberation we are very excited to share with you all today that we have selected

04:22:07.520 --> 04:22:13.760
these three deep dive sites our shasta consortium the anaheim union high school district as well as

04:22:13.760 --> 04:22:20.480
the west contra costa unified this unified school district together these three deep dives sites

04:22:20.480 --> 04:22:26.480
provide a diverse geographic and programmatic context within which to learn and assist the state

04:22:26.480 --> 04:22:33.760
in its transformational goals and so the next steps on our horizon which we are very excited

04:22:33.760 --> 04:22:41.200
about we will be hosting our first community annual community school summit on june 16th

04:22:41.200 --> 04:22:45.520
very excited to plan with that we'll be working with our regional transformational assistance

04:22:45.520 --> 04:22:52.160
centers as well as other partners to lift this the great work of this summit that we are planning

04:22:52.160 --> 04:22:57.600
we are also focusing our work on cohort one planning and implementation grantee surveys

04:22:57.600 --> 04:23:03.200
for our planning and implementation grantees and so really thinking about for planning grantees

04:23:03.200 --> 04:23:07.360
with the end goal after the two years being that they're creating an implementation plan that

04:23:07.360 --> 04:23:12.720
they're going to execute so really seeing what is the progress on on them completing this

04:23:12.720 --> 04:23:20.160
implementation plan for our implementation at grantee progress reporting we're thinking about

04:23:20.160 --> 04:23:24.320
questions and data around so in addition to the california school dashboard data

04:23:24.880 --> 04:23:30.400
you know of absenteeism of academics we're really thinking about what are the services

04:23:30.400 --> 04:23:35.040
what are the services that students are getting access to and are actually utilizing what are

04:23:35.040 --> 04:23:40.640
those services for the families and community members so dental vision health checkups so this

04:23:40.640 --> 04:23:47.520
this reporting will be a little bit more detailed and it'll help us get a baseline for for annual

04:23:47.520 --> 04:23:55.360
reporting we are also working with west ed on a on surveys for our planning and implementation

04:23:55.360 --> 04:24:00.640
grantees which should be released shortly to also collect more data around how this year and how

04:24:00.640 --> 04:24:06.240
planning and implementation has been going alignment among allied reforms i've mentioned this

04:24:06.320 --> 04:24:12.160
really thinking about coherence and sustainability we are going to be having meetings with children

04:24:12.160 --> 04:24:18.240
youth behavioral health initiative our partners at cde that are implementing expanded learning

04:24:18.240 --> 04:24:26.000
opportunities program universal pre-kindergarten to really recognize models where these reforms

04:24:26.000 --> 04:24:32.640
are in coherence and how sustainability of brand the blading of sorry braiding and blending funding

04:24:32.640 --> 04:24:39.440
and layering is helping to support these schools and communities and lastly we are excited to

04:24:39.440 --> 04:24:45.440
continue our transformational assistance and really maximizing the expertise of our regional

04:24:45.440 --> 04:24:49.840
transformational assistance centers i want to thank you for your time today that concludes

04:24:49.840 --> 04:24:53.040
my presentation and i will pass it on to pete callis

04:24:53.040 --> 04:25:02.160
thank you that's the time i'm going to bring up pete right now thank you dr pure wall thank you

04:25:02.160 --> 04:25:09.600

04:25:29.920 --> 04:25:36.640
who is here with us and also thank alisa rhymers who many of you know i just want to say as i bring

04:25:36.640 --> 04:25:42.960
pete up the work that this division has done is really extraordinary on community schools to

04:25:43.760 --> 04:25:50.480
to to really get us from vision to action to implementation and i can't tell you

04:25:51.040 --> 04:25:57.680
how hard they've worked a small team to really bring this to fruition director pete callis

04:26:02.240 --> 04:26:09.360
thank you steve so a brief overview of our planning grant awards originally from the

04:26:09.360 --> 04:26:15.360
original amount of money the 3.1 billion 10 of that was set aside for planning grantees so just

04:26:15.360 --> 04:26:24.960
over 287 million dollars was set aside for planning grants for 2021-22 and 2022-23 program years

04:26:25.680 --> 04:26:30.160
up to two-year grant period for each of them some of them may choose to get all of their

04:26:30.160 --> 04:26:35.440
planning done in one year and move forward to an implementation grant each of them received up to

04:26:35.440 --> 04:26:42.320
200 000 dollars per qualifying entity lea's they had to be lea's with no existing community

04:26:42.320 --> 04:26:51.120
schools in place so in 2022 sbe approved 193 lea's for planning grants for a total of just over 38

04:26:51.120 --> 04:27:02.400
million dollars for cohort two we had 226 lea's right we're recommending 226 lea's for planning

04:27:02.400 --> 04:27:10.160
grant awards there was an error in the item we had put in 227 we've made that adjustment in

04:27:10.160 --> 04:27:16.880
the item so we'll be reposting the item with the correct amount we had 140 school districts 10

04:27:16.880 --> 04:27:24.160
county offices and 76 charter schools included in this 226 the total planning grant allocation

04:27:24.240 --> 04:27:32.080
for cohort two is 44 million 894 thousand 432 dollars the cd will allocate the funding to

04:27:32.080 --> 04:27:39.120
cohort two for them to begin their program work on their planning for the 2023-24 fiscal year

04:27:40.080 --> 04:27:46.400
from the original 10 percent that was set aside for planning grants we have just over 204 million

04:27:46.400 --> 04:27:52.560
dollars left which should roll into some of our other work for implementation grants

04:27:54.240 --> 04:28:01.840
cohort one implementation grants is a brief overview sbe approved 600 just over 625 million

04:28:01.840 --> 04:28:12.080
dollars to support 458 schools in 76 lea's cohort two the rfa was posted on january 24th 2023

04:28:12.160 --> 04:28:20.400
applications are due on march 21st 2023 the cohort two rfa include includes a submission

04:28:20.400 --> 04:28:25.840
of an implementation plan for every school site listed in the application the submission of

04:28:25.840 --> 04:28:32.080
artifacts showing that each school site has conducted a community asset mapping and needs

04:28:32.080 --> 04:28:38.240
and gap analysis established a shared decision making council and evidence that the activities

04:28:38.320 --> 04:28:40.800
are aligned to our framework for community schools

04:28:44.160 --> 04:28:50.720
next steps for cde is to process and send grant award notifications for cohort two planning grant

04:28:50.720 --> 04:28:57.920
awardees present cohort two implementation grantees for approval at the may 2023 state

04:28:57.920 --> 04:29:05.440
board of education meeting release a formative evaluation rfp in spring of 2023 conduct outreach

04:29:05.440 --> 04:29:10.800
to cohort two planning grantees for technical assistance complete contracts with the eight

04:29:10.800 --> 04:29:17.440
regional technical assistance centers that we've selected and disperse just over 12 almost 13

04:29:17.440 --> 04:29:23.680
million dollars to county offices of education for the 2022-23 fiscal year and determine next

04:29:23.680 --> 04:29:28.320
year's funding after the cohort two implementation grantees are determined

04:29:28.640 --> 04:29:32.240
so we've had

04:29:34.240 --> 04:29:43.200
you want to do now

04:29:50.080 --> 04:29:57.200
sorry

04:29:58.320 --> 04:30:05.120
thanks alex we've had to make an edit to the recommendation based on the error that we had

04:30:05.120 --> 04:30:11.920
from the 227 originally in the item to the 226 along with the total dollar amount and the total

04:30:11.920 --> 04:30:16.640
dollar amount changed because one of our school districts we actually had to recalculate their

04:30:16.640 --> 04:30:22.880
budget and it came out to actually 200 000 data had actually submitted less than 200 000 so we

04:30:22.880 --> 04:30:28.400
wanted to make sure that was reflected in the recommendation so the new recommendation is the

04:30:28.400 --> 04:30:35.360
cd recommends that the state board of education approve the cc spp cohort two planning grant awards

04:30:35.360 --> 04:30:46.160
is set forth in the item but amended as follows total award amount is 44 894 432 total number of

04:30:46.240 --> 04:30:54.720
2022-23 grant awards is 226 and rockland unified school district was the budget that we had to

04:30:54.720 --> 04:30:59.360
amend as a 200 000 so that's our recommendation for approval

04:31:02.240 --> 04:31:07.360
thank you thank you so much not only for this report but for all the work that you have been

04:31:07.360 --> 04:31:14.000
doing to get us to this point it's really quite impressive we're going to open the public comment

04:31:14.640 --> 04:31:20.080
phone line for your setting up that queue the members of the public wishing to provide comment

04:31:20.080 --> 04:31:26.000
on this item may do so in person or by calling the telephone number and using the access code

04:31:26.000 --> 04:31:31.280
provided on the slide that's shown now and while we're made waiting for members of the public to

04:31:31.280 --> 04:31:36.960
call in i want to ask member yoshimoto tauri if she has some initial comments

04:31:36.960 --> 04:31:46.320
i'll be very brief board president but again i want to thank not only the department team but also

04:31:46.320 --> 04:31:51.440
the collaboration that's happening at this happening and being modeled at the state

04:31:51.440 --> 04:31:58.640
transformational assistance center and it's profound that we're calling it transformational

04:31:59.360 --> 04:32:04.240
as opposed to technical because community schools is an opportunity to tie in

04:32:04.400 --> 04:32:09.680
everything around mtss expanded learning opportunity grants it's ongoing funding

04:32:10.240 --> 04:32:15.760
the new arts and music dollars community engagement it brings it all together to braid everything

04:32:16.240 --> 04:32:20.800
so we're continuing to be excited about that and thank you for modeling the distributed leadership

04:32:22.320 --> 04:32:28.960
and i will simply add a plus one and i'm especially excited about the three

04:32:29.120 --> 04:32:36.320
three district county offices that are going to be sort of demonstration sites if you will

04:32:36.320 --> 04:32:44.080
to really model the practices it's a very innovative and helpful idea do we have any

04:32:45.120 --> 04:32:50.160
public comment in the room yes lorraine richards

04:32:51.040 --> 04:32:55.600
um good afternoon um state board of education members my name is lorraine richards and i am a

04:32:55.600 --> 04:33:01.120
classroom teacher representing the california teacher association cta continues to appreciate

04:33:01.120 --> 04:33:05.520
the work of the cde and state board of education in helping the state progress further down the

04:33:05.520 --> 04:33:11.520
path of community schools implementation cta is appreciative of the updated

04:33:11.520 --> 04:33:17.040
information that we've received from the state board of education and state board of education

04:33:17.760 --> 04:33:24.400
cta is appreciative of the updated rfa for the cohort two implementation grant and strongly

04:33:24.400 --> 04:33:29.920
believe the requirement of artifacts will help the fidelity to the california community schools

04:33:29.920 --> 04:33:38.320
framework and to ensure lea's are authentically engaging in shared decision making cta is impressed

04:33:38.320 --> 04:33:44.560
and supportive of the stac and feels that alameda county and ucla have been tremendous leads for

04:33:44.560 --> 04:33:50.560
this work their work continues to be grounded in the framework and is cognizant of ensuring that

04:33:50.560 --> 04:33:57.760
all four pillars are ever present we would like to recommend that each of the our tax and the

04:33:57.760 --> 04:34:02.480
county offices of education receiving coordination grants establish their shared decision making

04:34:02.480 --> 04:34:13.280
structures so they can be seen as models for grantees thank you there uh any other public

04:34:13.280 --> 04:34:19.840
comment in the room or on the phone there is one caller in the queue i will open the phone line now

04:34:21.280 --> 04:34:24.400
good afternoon please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute

04:34:24.400 --> 04:34:32.080
your time starts now good afternoon diana neaver with the community schools learning exchange

04:34:32.080 --> 04:34:37.520
cslx has been working directly with several lea's regional ta centers as well as planning

04:34:37.520 --> 04:34:42.080
and implementation grantees to support the development of strong and effective community

04:34:42.080 --> 04:34:46.800
school strategies our comments today are from this on the ground vantage point

04:34:47.520 --> 04:34:52.720
regarding the current implementation grant rfa and the new requirements to submit artifacts

04:34:52.720 --> 04:35:00.000
related to needs assessments and advisory councils at the site level and for all sites

04:35:00.000 --> 04:35:05.600
as part of an lea's application while we understand how these requirements reflect the practices of a

04:35:05.600 --> 04:35:11.040
mature community school we also see that such requirements when tied to a competitive grant

04:35:11.040 --> 04:35:18.320
application incentivizes a compliance orientation for potential grantees for example having to

04:35:18.320 --> 04:35:24.240
complete site-based needs assessments before they have adequate funding and staffing infrastructure

04:35:24.240 --> 04:35:31.840
like site coordinators to do this work well thank you very much for your consideration cslx is here

04:35:31.840 --> 04:35:39.600
to help thank you okay that concludes public comment for item number nine okay thank you

04:35:39.600 --> 04:35:48.640
very much at this point if there's any other board comment questions or discussion vice president

04:35:48.640 --> 04:35:59.280
global works just a quick question as it relates to lea's that receive planning grants are they

04:35:59.280 --> 04:36:06.720
then required to apply for an implementation grant or can an lea receive a planning grant

04:36:07.520 --> 04:36:13.040
and not move not do anything else as it relates to establishing a community school

04:36:13.760 --> 04:36:20.880
we certainly hope thank you for your question vice president cloverwood we certainly hope that

04:36:20.880 --> 04:36:27.680
they would apply for implement implementation grants that is the intention and that is where

04:36:27.680 --> 04:36:33.920
our and and i want to get this right i i always say i still revert back to technical assistance

04:36:33.920 --> 04:36:44.480
where our transformational assistance is directed it is the case however that because our planning

04:36:44.480 --> 04:36:53.920
grants are at the threshold of 50 percent and our implementation grants have at least to date been

04:36:54.560 --> 04:37:01.520
a much higher threshold in terms of our our equity threshold for implementation grants

04:37:02.240 --> 04:37:09.360
that we do see the possibility that the work of the planning grants and in in many lea's

04:37:09.360 --> 04:37:19.440
we hope will be if you'll forgive me of using the term wall-to-wall we hope that we hope that lea's

04:37:19.440 --> 04:37:24.400
will consider a community school implementation for all of their schools

04:37:25.360 --> 04:37:33.840
we want them to prioritize the schools that they select to implement first we want them to prioritize

04:37:33.840 --> 04:37:42.080
in equity lines we understand that our implementation grants have funded those schools

04:37:42.560 --> 04:37:50.400
that have the the greatest needs and that an lea may have schools that don't qualify

04:37:50.400 --> 04:37:59.360
qualify so in in terms of our expectation absolutely we would expect that planning

04:37:59.360 --> 04:38:06.240
grantees then become our implementation grantees but because planning grants are lea are are at

04:38:06.240 --> 04:38:13.840
the lea level implementation is at the site level we know that or we expect that some of the work of

04:38:13.920 --> 04:38:22.800
planning will be applied to school school sites that don't end up as school site implementation

04:38:22.800 --> 04:38:33.040
grantees i will also note that there is a two-year timeline for the for the planning grants so and

04:38:33.040 --> 04:38:36.240
this relates a little bit to the public comment that came in

04:38:37.040 --> 04:38:44.000
and planning grantees are not required to apply for implementation grants

04:38:44.000 --> 04:38:51.440
one year after they receive the planning grants they can apply you know throughout the cycle

04:38:51.440 --> 04:38:57.360
of our rfas for implementation grants planning grantees are are welcome to apply for for those

04:38:57.360 --> 04:39:03.440
grants so i hope that i answered your question i what i want folks to understand is is that

04:39:04.080 --> 04:39:15.600
the work of the planning grant process may apply to schools that that are not necessarily funded

04:39:15.600 --> 04:39:21.920
for implementation grants and so you know we we're going to be interested to see this will be our

04:39:21.920 --> 04:39:29.600
first kind of data set if you will this year how many of our planning grantees how many of their

04:39:29.600 --> 04:39:34.560
schools then became in this next cohort implementation grantees but we won't know

04:39:34.560 --> 04:39:38.960
that until may i'm going to look forward to sharing that data with you thank you i look

04:39:38.960 --> 04:39:44.720
forward to hearing that and that data as well and i do believe everyone has the most positive

04:39:44.720 --> 04:39:50.080
intentions when applying for the planning grants and it's it's helpful i think for our board to

04:39:50.080 --> 04:39:55.920
know if there are those who do apply for the planning grant but it does not come out in

04:39:56.000 --> 04:40:02.240
fruition to actually establishing a community school or bringing those practices pervasive in

04:40:02.240 --> 04:40:11.120
their lea or school thank you thank you any other questions are clarifying um yes member

04:40:11.120 --> 04:40:16.720
Roscoe Gonzales and then member Patito Bronson i just have a comment my comment is in the

04:40:16.720 --> 04:40:23.360
requirement of artifacts as outlined on the rfa i think this is good this will help ensure

04:40:24.080 --> 04:40:28.640
there's adherence to the california community schools framework and help to ensure that the

04:40:28.640 --> 04:40:33.920
lea's are authentically engaging in shared decision making because i think that's where

04:40:33.920 --> 04:40:41.040
the core of this transformative education in community schools is just shifting so i think

04:40:41.040 --> 04:40:49.920
that will be that shared decision making key to this process member patil bronson also in the

04:40:49.920 --> 04:40:53.360
category of comments i just want to thank you for the presentation and also for

04:40:54.640 --> 04:41:00.000
highlighting the shasta consortium as one of the three deep dive sites and flagging that it would

04:41:00.000 --> 04:41:08.720
be great to hear more as you learn more about their pre-k to three focus thank you and at this

04:41:08.720 --> 04:41:15.840
point yes member mcclellan yes thank you for the presentation it's great to see the list of places

04:41:15.840 --> 04:41:21.840
like happy camp and willow creek and these trinity valley these really remote on top of

04:41:21.840 --> 04:41:28.320
remote locations but the breakdown in terms of remote applicants for the planning phase are

04:41:28.320 --> 04:41:36.720
is it are we on task there are we fairly representative we are i think we'll always

04:41:36.720 --> 04:41:46.640
have more work to do and and i think we always have to have our i think we we always have to

04:41:46.640 --> 04:41:57.120
look very very carefully and kind of get very granular you're right we we we do see a larger

04:41:57.120 --> 04:42:03.200
number of uh of rural communities in this round than we saw last year

04:42:04.640 --> 04:42:12.560
are there still as i described it are there still deserts there are still deserts and trying to

04:42:12.560 --> 04:42:23.120
understand um you know where we have potentially qualifying lea's that are still not subscribing

04:42:23.120 --> 04:42:32.480
if you will it's something that we're continually reflective on we do see more uh more applicants

04:42:32.480 --> 04:42:40.320
from our our small and rural lea's um and i think the deep dive into shasta i think that

04:42:40.880 --> 04:42:49.600
the attention that we're we are given to giving to making sure that this is in the uh in the in

04:42:49.600 --> 04:42:56.560
the consciousness uh in the intentionality of the planning for the regional transformative

04:42:56.560 --> 04:43:05.680
assistance centers um will we hope we'll have a high correlation going back to vice president

04:43:05.680 --> 04:43:13.760
glover woods question between planning grant uh between planning grant process and implementation

04:43:13.840 --> 04:43:19.760
grant applications but again um we're going to have an interesting data set for us all to look

04:43:19.760 --> 04:43:25.520
at in may um when we when we look at that correlation um so it is a work in progress

04:43:26.320 --> 04:43:30.080
but i'm happy to report that we are doing better this year than we were last year

04:43:33.440 --> 04:43:40.000

all right we're moving moving on to uh item 10 item 10 is the time community school

04:45:43.120 --> 04:45:50.000
consider issuing a notice of violation pursuant to california education code section 47607 g

04:45:50.480 --> 04:45:56.720
uh the cde recommends that we consider issuing a notice of violation to time pursuant to ec

04:45:56.720 --> 04:46:04.160
section 47607 g as time has failed to exercise prudent fiscal management and we generally accepted

04:46:04.160 --> 04:46:11.040
accounting principles and i will leave the rest of the proposal to stephanie farland who is going to

04:46:12.000 --> 04:46:16.720
present the item along with staff from the los angeles county office of education

04:46:16.880 --> 04:46:22.640
education uh when the state board authorized this charter school the board delegated oversight and

04:46:22.640 --> 04:46:30.320
monitoring to the la county office of education therefore cde and lacoe are jointly presenting

04:46:30.320 --> 04:46:36.640
the staff recommendation stephanie please begin great thank you good afternoon uh president

04:46:36.640 --> 04:46:43.600
darling hammon vice president glover woods board members and chief deputy mary nicely um

04:46:43.600 --> 04:46:51.120
um so as mentioned we are uh requesting a consideration of the issuance of a notice

04:46:51.120 --> 04:46:59.840
of violation to time community pursuant to ed code section 47607 g the oversight um of time

04:46:59.840 --> 04:47:06.880
as mentioned by president darling hammon um is being conducted by the los angeles county office

04:47:06.880 --> 04:47:15.520
of education's charter schools office in previous action uh the state board voted to approve time

04:47:15.520 --> 04:47:26.240
in july of 2020 and in july 14th of 2022 we did come before this board and ask the same uh to

04:47:26.240 --> 04:47:35.120
issue a notice of violation to time um that motion failed to gather six votes it was a five to four

04:47:35.120 --> 04:47:40.960
vote and we need six to have an action so the sbe in effect took no action that day and a no

04:47:41.680 --> 04:47:51.760
notice of violation was not issued over the course of its oversight um duties lacoe has expressed

04:47:51.760 --> 04:48:00.080
their concerns regarding times fiscal sustainability a lot of this um was presented to you in july it

04:48:00.160 --> 04:48:07.360
has not changed it has only deteriorated laco has consistently collaborated with and provided

04:48:07.360 --> 04:48:12.000
guidance to time in an effort to bring the school into a more stable fiscal position

04:48:12.000 --> 04:48:17.360
despite lacos issuance of numerous letters of concern to time the school's fiscal condition

04:48:17.360 --> 04:48:23.200
continues to deteriorate and the school isn't even a worse fiscal position than it was in july 2022

04:48:23.360 --> 04:48:30.320
so as stated our recommendation today is to uh is to ask the state board of ed to consider issuing

04:48:30.320 --> 04:48:44.480
a no to time pursuant to 47607 g for um our purposes today we did want to provide uh a

04:48:44.480 --> 04:48:49.200
definition of fiscal mismanagement fiscal mismanagement is the term used in ed code

04:48:49.280 --> 04:48:59.360
in ed code to describe the condition that we can use to issue a notice of violation

04:48:59.360 --> 04:49:05.040
and for our purposes a failure to appropriately manage an agency's finances thereby creating a

04:49:05.040 --> 04:49:11.120
substantial risk of the to the agency's ability to function or accomplish its mission possible

04:49:11.120 --> 04:49:15.600
indicators of fiscal mismanagement for charter schools may include one or more of the following

04:49:16.080 --> 04:49:22.320
unreliable or insufficient budget development monitoring or updates inadequate cash management

04:49:22.320 --> 04:49:28.320
mismanaged employee compensation continuing deficit spending inattention to enrollment

04:49:28.320 --> 04:49:33.920
and attendance reporting inadequate fund balance and reserve for economic uncertainty

04:49:33.920 --> 04:49:38.880
ineffective internal controls and fraud prevention lack of multi-year planning

04:49:39.440 --> 04:49:46.240
inattention to debt and risk management so those this is a definition that we're using obviously

04:49:48.080 --> 04:49:54.880
on occasion fiscal mismanagement can include fraud but in this case it does not but i think

04:49:54.880 --> 04:50:02.240
you will see throughout the presentation that time uh charter does meet many many if not all

04:50:02.320 --> 04:50:03.760
of the indicators listed here

04:50:06.480 --> 04:50:15.680
and i'm going to hand it over to indra chicarelli um to present uh their oversight and their

04:50:15.680 --> 04:50:22.560
concerns thank you so much

04:50:27.360 --> 04:50:31.920
so good morning board members my name is indra chicarelli i am the director of the charter

04:50:31.920 --> 04:50:39.280
school's office at the los angeles county office of education as you know time community school

04:50:39.280 --> 04:50:45.760
began instruction in july of 2021 in monabelo california within the boundaries of monabelo

04:50:45.760 --> 04:50:52.640
unified school district in its first year of operation time planned to enroll 260 students

04:50:52.640 --> 04:51:00.240
in grades nine and ten however the school opened with only 27 students eventually enrolling a total

04:51:00.240 --> 04:51:05.840
of just 41 students for the remainder of the school year for the current school year as of

04:51:05.840 --> 04:51:16.080
december 2022 time had 65 students enrolled the school's mission is displayed on the slide in

04:51:16.080 --> 04:51:26.320
front of you the operating entity is time community education since times authorization

04:51:26.320 --> 04:51:33.280
laco has taken many steps to support the charter school including nine site visits by laco staff

04:51:34.000 --> 04:51:39.520
including the charter school office our facilities unit pupil attendance accounting and compliance

04:51:39.520 --> 04:51:43.920
los angeles county selfa and even our laco board members have visited the school

04:51:46.480 --> 04:51:50.560
two comprehensive meetings with the executive director and members of the time governing board

04:51:51.520 --> 04:51:57.360
monthly fiscal monitoring bi-weekly zoom meetings with all county authorized charter schools

04:51:58.160 --> 04:52:02.800
and of course regular meetings calls and emails with their laco assigned coordinator

04:52:05.120 --> 04:52:11.680
unfortunately time has been unwilling to implement much of the fiscal guidance offered by laco staff

04:52:11.680 --> 04:52:17.760
based on laco's extensive experience with new charter schools therefore despite this widespread

04:52:17.920 --> 04:52:22.400
support laco staff were prompted to send two notifications of concern

04:52:22.400 --> 04:52:29.440
delivered to the time board on january 26th and june 28th of 2022 i'll now pass the presentation

04:52:29.440 --> 04:52:33.840
over to my colleague dr brown to review some of our fiscal concerns with the time school

04:52:37.280 --> 04:52:41.920
thank you and good afternoon board president board members the following fiscal concerns

04:52:41.920 --> 04:52:49.200
were listed in the laco january 26 2022 notice of concern time failed to demonstrate fiscal

04:52:49.200 --> 04:52:55.760
viability for the 2122 school year and subsequent fiscal years due to its enrollment shortfall

04:52:55.760 --> 04:53:02.880
deficit spending potential cash deficiencies reliance on debt and a negative net ending position

04:53:02.880 --> 04:53:10.960
for the 2122 school fiscal year laco sent time a second notice of concern on june 28 2022

04:53:11.520 --> 04:53:16.080
based on continued unrealistic enrollment and average daily attendance projection

04:53:16.080 --> 04:53:21.920
which grossly impacted revenue and school operations additional concerns were documented

04:53:21.920 --> 04:53:28.480
in the notice including the school's projected fiscal insolvency debt accumulation and unreliable

04:53:28.560 --> 04:53:29.520
cash projections

04:53:39.920 --> 04:53:44.240
the current concerns regarding time community school are listed on the slide in front of you

04:53:44.240 --> 04:53:50.320
and will be detailed in the slides to follow one more thanks now we're good

04:53:52.080 --> 04:53:55.440
pardon me the current concerns regarding time community school are listed on the

04:53:55.440 --> 04:54:00.000
slide in front of you and will be detailed in the slides to follow of note is the fact that

04:54:00.000 --> 04:54:04.880
the school's adopted budget for the current school year again included unrealistic enrollment and

04:54:04.880 --> 04:54:11.360
88 projections in spite of guidance from laco to plan more conservatively based on the enrollment

04:54:11.360 --> 04:54:16.800
and attendance shortfall from the previous school year this pattern of planning will continue to

04:54:16.800 --> 04:54:22.400
perpetuate a structural deficit and fiscal insolvency despite any significant one-time

04:54:22.400 --> 04:54:24.000
funds secured by the school

04:54:26.960 --> 04:54:32.560
both laco and cd staff found that time's budget and multi-year projections are based on unrealistic

04:54:32.560 --> 04:54:38.160
enrollment and 88 projections in addition time's fiscal and salt fiscally and time is fiscally

04:54:38.160 --> 04:54:43.600
insolvent excuse me for the current school year and subsequent two fiscal years due to

04:54:43.600 --> 04:54:48.160
structural deficits inadequate cash and continued accumulation of debt

04:54:48.720 --> 04:54:53.280
the table before you illustrates time's unrealistic enrollment and 88 projections

04:54:53.280 --> 04:55:00.880
for the last fiscal year and current fiscal year in 2021-22 time projected an ada of approximately

04:55:00.880 --> 04:55:08.880
156 students but a certified p2 report showed an ada of approximately 34 students a shortfall of

04:55:09.200 --> 04:55:18.080
122 students or 78 percent below the projected ada in 2022-23 time projected an ada of approximately

04:55:18.080 --> 04:55:25.360
104 students but its reported p1 ada showed approximately 55 students a shortfall of 49

04:55:25.360 --> 04:55:32.240
students or 47 percent below projected ada it should be noted that in correspondence to the

04:55:32.640 --> 04:55:40.240
it should be noted that in correspondence to the state board on july july 8 2022 time stated that

04:55:40.240 --> 04:55:45.840
enrollment for its second year included 70 fully registered students with an additional 15

04:55:45.840 --> 04:55:53.200
registrations in progress for a total of 85 students however time began the 22-23 school year

04:55:53.760 --> 04:56:00.240
with 63 students in addition the school is considering projecting 125 students for next

04:56:00.320 --> 04:56:03.360
school year which is almost double its current enrollment

04:56:07.200 --> 04:56:12.320
the table before you summarizes time's financial projections for the last fiscal year and current

04:56:12.320 --> 04:56:21.600
fiscal year times 2021-22 adopted budget projected an operating surplus of approximately 375 thousand

04:56:21.600 --> 04:56:29.280
dollars and an ending net position of approximately 468 thousand dollars however the school ended the

04:56:29.280 --> 04:56:36.080
fiscal year with a deficit of just over 378 thousand dollars and a negative ending net position

04:56:36.080 --> 04:56:45.920
of 268 thousand 436 dollars times 2022-23 adopted budget projected an operating surplus of

04:56:45.920 --> 04:56:53.200
approximately 509 thousand dollars and an ending net position of approximately 285 thousand dollars

04:56:54.080 --> 04:56:58.960
however the school's first interim report updated its projections to incur a deficit

04:56:58.960 --> 04:57:05.360
of approximately 68 thousand dollars and an ending net position of negative 336 thousand

04:57:06.000 --> 04:57:15.040
748 dollars for the 22-23 school year times actual revenues and expenses from july 1 through

04:57:15.040 --> 04:57:24.240
december 31st reflect an operating deficit of 424 thousand 269 dollars and an ending net position

04:57:24.240 --> 04:57:33.120
of negative 692 thousand 704 dollars laco remains concerned with times fiscal insolvency status

04:57:33.120 --> 04:57:40.720
due to the level of deficit deficit spending rising debts and cash deficiencies times reserves

04:57:40.720 --> 04:57:47.520
for economic uncertainties is negative 23.3 percent which is substantially below the three

04:57:47.520 --> 04:57:52.720
percent minimum reserve required pursuant to the laco monitoring memorandum of understanding

04:57:54.640 --> 04:58:00.320
the table before you summarizes the changes in times fiscal position based on reported actuals

04:58:00.320 --> 04:58:07.920
from july 1 through december 31st due to deficit spending as previously discussed times total

04:58:07.920 --> 04:58:19.440
assets have decreased from 226 663 dollars to negative 19 432 dollars a decrease in total assets

04:58:19.440 --> 04:58:32.160
by approximately 246 thousand dollars the negative net assets of 19 432 dollars is due to the sale

04:58:32.160 --> 04:58:39.440
of future state aid receivables of two hundred and 247 thousand and 600 dollars offset by other

04:58:39.440 --> 04:58:44.880
assets including cash a cash balance of fourteen thousand one hundred and eighty nine dollars

04:58:45.040 --> 04:58:50.400
times total liabilities increased from july 1 from a july 1 balance of approximately

04:58:51.440 --> 04:59:00.720
four hundred and ninety five thousand dollars to 673 273 dollars as of december 31st an increase

04:59:00.720 --> 04:59:09.120
in total liabilities of approximately 178 thousand dollars or 36 percent total net assets decreased

04:59:09.120 --> 04:59:14.320
by 424 269 dollars

04:59:18.480 --> 04:59:23.360
as previously stated times unrealistic projections have contributed significantly to

04:59:23.360 --> 04:59:29.120
its current fiscal position the school's adopted 2223 budget included approximately

04:59:29.120 --> 04:59:34.080
two hundred and forty seven thousand dollars in revenue from subleasing space within the

04:59:34.080 --> 04:59:40.000
school's facility leco staff met with time to express concern regarding the school's ability

04:59:40.000 --> 04:59:46.320
to secure subleases totaling the budgeted amount the amount was later revised to 150 thousand

04:59:46.320 --> 04:59:54.560
dollars in anticipated subleasing revenue time has actualized just 16 140 dollars in subleasing

04:59:54.560 --> 05:00:01.120
revenue through january of 2023 which projects a shortfall in subleasing revenue of approximately

05:00:01.120 --> 05:00:06.560
101 thousand dollars i will now turn the presentation back over to mr chicarelli

05:00:09.760 --> 05:00:10.560
thank you dr brown

05:00:13.840 --> 05:00:19.040
so this table further illustrates times ongoing realistic revenue projections i know

05:00:19.040 --> 05:00:23.600
dr brown just talked a little bit there about the leasing but i want to highlight that this is sort

05:00:23.600 --> 05:00:31.920
of an ongoing issue with the school so in 2023 their adopted budget for the school year projected

05:00:31.920 --> 05:00:36.800
two hundred forty seven thousand five hundred dollars in annual revenues for subleasing as

05:00:36.800 --> 05:00:43.280
dr brown just said at the start of the year these leases had not been executed and a revised budget

05:00:43.280 --> 05:00:50.800
in october then projected 150 000 despite still having un-executed leases in december school

05:00:50.800 --> 05:00:56.000
leadership assured leco that a january lease for ten thousand dollars a month was forthcoming

05:00:56.720 --> 05:01:02.480
in january this was revised again to begin in february and in february revised yet again to

05:01:02.480 --> 05:01:11.040
begin in march now for six thousand rather than ten thousand just as times projected lease revenue

05:01:11.040 --> 05:01:16.480
in year two was unrealistic so too has their budgeted attendance rate despite historic data

05:01:16.480 --> 05:01:21.280
to the contrary time budgeted at a 95 attendance rate this year

05:01:21.280 --> 05:01:24.800
this significantly impacts the projected and budgeted aba

05:01:30.400 --> 05:01:34.480
this slide here illustrates the concerns with debt accumulation and cash management

05:01:35.600 --> 05:01:41.280
as of december 31st 2022 time has a total liabilities of approximately six hundred

05:01:41.360 --> 05:01:47.440
seventy three thousand dollars comprised of the following six promissory notes totaling over

05:01:47.440 --> 05:01:52.400
two hundred seventy nine thousand five of which are due to the executive director

05:01:52.400 --> 05:01:57.200
and one to a private individual and all of which have been defaulted for at least six months

05:01:58.800 --> 05:02:02.800
accounts payable and accrued liabilities totaling over three hundred seven thousand

05:02:03.520 --> 05:02:07.920
and a california school financing authority loan balance of over eighty six thousand

05:02:08.640 --> 05:02:12.720
additionally time has not submitted a plan to retire this outstanding debt

05:02:17.360 --> 05:02:25.360
as of december 31st 2022 time had a cash balance of just over a little a little over fourteen

05:02:25.360 --> 05:02:32.240
thousand or just four days of operating cash the school has been late on several facilities

05:02:32.240 --> 05:02:38.960
lease payments incurring late fees and so due to its structural deficit rising debts and inadequate

05:02:38.960 --> 05:02:44.880
cash time may not be able to meet its financial obligations including payroll and related expenses

05:02:44.880 --> 05:02:47.440
in the current and subsequent fiscal years

05:02:50.800 --> 05:02:55.280
lastly the time boards approved fiscal policies included in the charter petition

05:02:55.840 --> 05:02:59.440
state that the governing board will approve all loans from third parties

05:02:59.600 --> 05:03:07.360
on january 31st 2023 laco received a promissory note for a loan to time executed on january 12th

05:03:07.360 --> 05:03:13.120
2023 the school's executive director confirmed that the board approved the promissory note

05:03:13.120 --> 05:03:19.280
after it was executed and in direct violation of the adopted fiscal policies this matter poses

05:03:19.280 --> 05:03:24.480
concerns regarding the school's adherence to the checks and balances delineated in the fiscal

05:03:25.280 --> 05:03:35.200
policies so as this board can see we have serious concerns with time's ability to meet its fiscal

05:03:35.200 --> 05:03:41.680
responsibilities we understand that there have been challenges having been a charter leader myself

05:03:42.400 --> 05:03:48.560
i was often faced with challenges that were beyond my control good school leaders don't lead problem

05:03:48.560 --> 05:03:56.320
free lives they're simply able to respond to challenges and adjust accordingly unfortunately

05:03:56.320 --> 05:04:01.120
at every point where time leadership is given the opportunity to adjust their budget according to

05:04:01.120 --> 05:04:08.160
real numbers they refuse to do so they do not use historic or baseline data and therefore fail to

05:04:08.160 --> 05:04:13.760
manage their money accordingly this is why in two years the school's debt has ballooned to almost

05:04:13.760 --> 05:04:21.440
700 000 without a realistic plan to remove this debt time continues to have a structural deficit

05:04:22.000 --> 05:04:26.080
such that even if the school were able to receive significant one-time funds

05:04:26.080 --> 05:04:33.600
this structural deficit would maintain its fiscal insolvency we've given advice our seasoned and

05:04:33.600 --> 05:04:39.760
experienced fiscal advisors have given advice we don't want any of our schools to fail we would

05:04:39.760 --> 05:04:45.360
love to see time's latest plan come to fruition which includes income from community bingo

05:04:47.120 --> 05:04:50.480
maybe the non-profit will start making five thousand dollars a week from bingo

05:04:52.480 --> 05:04:57.600
however we can't ignore historical data evidencing an inability to follow through

05:04:58.560 --> 05:05:02.880
we cannot in good conscience simply hope for the best without planning for the worst

05:05:03.840 --> 05:05:09.280
a positive vote from you today doesn't close this school again the non-profit could start

05:05:09.280 --> 05:05:15.040
making five thousand dollars from bingo next week and when the actual closure vote comes in may

05:05:15.040 --> 05:05:19.840
you could be looking at a very different financial picture we sincerely hope that's true

05:05:21.200 --> 05:05:26.560
but we need to advocate for the students and staff that will suffer if it's not we need to

05:05:26.560 --> 05:05:30.800
stop this debt train before there is a mid-year closure that would be devastating to this

05:05:31.440 --> 05:05:38.400
community again your vote today does not close this school we urge you to issue a notice of

05:05:38.400 --> 05:05:43.520
violation today and give the school one last chance to make good on its promise to this community

05:05:44.320 --> 05:05:47.360
i'll now hand the presentation back to the cde staff thank you

05:05:51.840 --> 05:05:58.240
thank you so the conclusion and recommendation is that time has failed to meet generally accepted

05:05:58.240 --> 05:06:03.840
accounting principles and has engaged in fiscal mismanagement the cde recommends the state board

05:06:03.840 --> 05:06:11.040
consider issuing a notice of violation to time pursuant to ed code section 47607 g upon the

05:06:11.040 --> 05:06:15.360
chartering authorities issuance of a no the school is provided with a reasonable opportunity to

05:06:15.360 --> 05:06:22.160
remedy the violations and that concludes our presentation thank you so much very much appreciated

05:06:23.280 --> 05:06:27.360
while this item is not a public hearing we would like to provide an opportunity

05:06:27.360 --> 05:06:32.480

board members and dr thurman my name is dr gable ramirez and i'm the executive director and founder

05:07:12.960 --> 05:07:18.000
of time community schools a charter unanimously approved by the state board in july 2020 to serve

05:07:18.000 --> 05:07:24.480
the underserved community of monobelo i'd like to reacquaint you with who we are and who we serve

05:07:24.480 --> 05:07:28.960
we are a community where only 30 of students upon graduation are eligible to apply to a four-year

05:07:28.960 --> 05:07:35.040
university after the age of 25 only 16 percent have a degree of a or higher approximately 70

05:07:35.040 --> 05:07:40.720
of the students who have come to tcs come with an average gpa of 1.5 in our first year 45 percent

05:07:40.720 --> 05:07:45.040
of our students were el and 40 percent were sped students both rates are 10 higher than the

05:07:45.040 --> 05:07:50.800
districts here's what we've accomplished in our first two years after year one our students had

05:07:50.800 --> 05:07:57.120
an average gpa of 2.5 this year year two after semester one our students had an average gpa of

05:07:57.120 --> 05:08:03.120
2.8 ninth grade students scored higher than the national average on nwa in english 100 percent

05:08:03.120 --> 05:08:08.400
of our students participate in our dual enrollment program with east los angeles college 100 percent

05:08:08.400 --> 05:08:13.760
of our students pursue cte pathways and internships 100 percent of our students participate in clubs

05:08:13.760 --> 05:08:20.240
100 percent of our students receive tutoring time is fully wask accredited tcs has been accepted

05:08:20.240 --> 05:08:24.960
into the league of innovative schools the first single school to receive this honor tcs was just

05:08:24.960 --> 05:08:30.000
awarded a 78 000 grant so its teachers can participate in the modern classroom project

05:08:30.000 --> 05:08:34.720
a grant typically given to district schools were awarded to tcs because of our innovative model

05:08:34.720 --> 05:08:39.120
tcs has identified and secured partnerships with six middle schools to promote our school and to

05:08:39.120 --> 05:08:45.120
allow us to recruit on sites tcs has established 25 community-based organizations and businesses

05:08:45.120 --> 05:08:50.640
that have committed to promoting time to all its families and providing internships i will now

05:08:50.640 --> 05:08:54.560
review with you where we departed our understanding of the issues from what is written in the board

05:08:54.560 --> 05:09:00.560
item the october 6th and 11th letters from laco were not letters labeled letters of concern and

05:09:00.560 --> 05:09:05.280
they did not warn about replication they were letters following up on a submitted on submitted

05:09:05.280 --> 05:09:10.160
reports asking for additional information and plans no further follow-up to these letters

05:09:10.160 --> 05:09:14.720
were made which we reasonably understood to mean that laco was satisfied with our response

05:09:14.800 --> 05:09:20.800
we do not have declining enrollment our enrollment grew 50 in year two we currently have 60 new

05:09:20.800 --> 05:09:27.360
applications with the goal of acquiring 125 applications of these time needs approximately

05:09:29.760 --> 05:09:34.800
30 students for next school year to remain viable and address our financial deficits

05:09:34.800 --> 05:09:39.120
our preliminary budgets were not unrealistic we were constantly updating them as actual

05:09:39.200 --> 05:09:44.160
enrollment was determined it is important to understand that a key problem here is not

05:09:44.160 --> 05:09:48.880
mismanagement but rather the failure of laco and cde to provide the mandatory letter of good

05:09:48.880 --> 05:09:53.440
standing in order for us to obtain the funding our students are otherwise entitled to our fiscal

05:09:53.440 --> 05:09:57.600
shortfalls are not a result of mismanagement or failure to follow accounting principles

05:09:57.600 --> 05:10:02.320
they are a result of being denied a letter of good standing which impacted several funding streams

05:10:02.320 --> 05:10:08.960
typically available to new charter schools including pcsgp sp740 prop 39 the revolving

05:10:08.960 --> 05:10:13.600
loan denial of these funds required legal intervention and legal bills totaling over

05:10:13.600 --> 05:10:19.840
140 000 of first year up our first year of operation 2122 monabella offered substandard

05:10:19.840 --> 05:10:24.880
inadequate prop for 39 facilities we agreed mid-year to settlement which the district then

05:10:24.880 --> 05:10:29.760
breached so we had no real school year during the 2122 school year you considered a notice of

05:10:29.760 --> 05:10:34.240
violation in july 22 but voted against us to allow a chance to operate in a new facility

05:10:34.800 --> 05:10:42.000
the january 23rd letter identifies a due date of march 9th today to respond any action today

05:10:42.000 --> 05:10:48.640
seems premature but i'd like to address the concerns in the draft notice the draft notice

05:10:48.640 --> 05:10:53.440
states at time is in default but this is incorrect no lender has claimed default on any loan for

05:10:53.440 --> 05:10:58.400
non-payment new agreements have been approved to allow an extension of repayment and one a lender

05:10:58.400 --> 05:11:05.120
has agreed to a gift their to gift their portion of the loans totaling over 218 000 the remaining

05:11:05.120 --> 05:11:09.680
notes are intended to be addressed this school year cd staff also states that the final audit

05:11:09.680 --> 05:11:15.040
for the 2122 states that time is in default with loans but again this is incorrect the audit had

05:11:15.040 --> 05:11:19.840
no findings the audit does mention that recurring deficit as a going concern but the audit further

05:11:19.840 --> 05:11:25.120
states that the leading cause is due to enrollment issues in part due to the pandemic to clarify

05:11:25.120 --> 05:11:29.520
cde's misstatement regarding defaults per the audit the charter school revolving loan is not

05:11:29.520 --> 05:11:34.640
in default monthly payments are deducted from our monthly apportionments from state aid lastly the

05:11:34.640 --> 05:11:40.560
audit does recognize the school's plan to reduce the deficit in regards to enrollment we have

05:11:40.560 --> 05:11:45.440
conservatively budgeted for the next two years starting with 2324 with an enrollment of 92

05:11:45.440 --> 05:11:51.840
students 30 more than we have now at an 88 rate of 90 which mirrors our p1 numbers allowing us to

05:11:51.840 --> 05:11:58.080
end the year at a surplus of 209 000 in the 2425 we intend to eliminate the cumulative of all

05:11:58.080 --> 05:12:04.720
year's deficit to meet the minimum moe reserve of three percent by enrolling 160 students and

05:12:04.720 --> 05:12:10.320
maintaining the conservative 90 80 which is 143 students beyond state aid we have two other

05:12:10.320 --> 05:12:16.160
revenue streams in the forms of sub leases and fundraising via bingo if bingo revenue materializes

05:12:16.160 --> 05:12:20.880
as plans to be able to address debt this year in the coming years reducing debt sooner than

05:12:20.880 --> 05:12:31.200
expected as you can see your time is up thank you thank you very much for that presentation

05:12:32.320 --> 05:12:38.240
members of the public wishing to provide comment on this item they do so in person or by calling

05:12:38.240 --> 05:12:42.800
the telephone number and using the access code on the slide that we are about to put back on the

05:12:42.880 --> 05:12:46.640
screen public comment slide

05:12:50.640 --> 05:12:55.280
and while we're waiting for members of the public to call in i want to ask our liaisons

05:12:55.280 --> 05:12:59.200
vice president glover woods and member oaken if they have any initial comments

05:12:59.200 --> 05:13:03.760
and then i'll ask board members if they have any clarifying questions before we go to public comment

05:13:05.760 --> 05:13:10.400
thank you president darling hammon and i'd like to start my comments by thanking dr ramirez for

05:13:10.400 --> 05:13:17.600
his presentation and also thank you to the laco staff and cd staff this is always a very difficult

05:13:17.600 --> 05:13:25.040
conversation for a board to have i just want to point out to the board that we as was shared in

05:13:25.040 --> 05:13:34.080
the presentation have been here before if you will and the fiscal situation is worse than it was

05:13:34.160 --> 05:13:41.120
when it was before us we had some concerns about the language around fiscal mismanagement and i

05:13:41.120 --> 05:13:48.000
believe the cd staff and their definition have helped to clarify what that means the other

05:13:48.000 --> 05:13:54.400
aspect of it is we if my memory serves me right we were recognizing the impact of the pandemic

05:13:54.400 --> 05:14:02.160
on the enrollment unfortunately again as we see the numbers the enrollment has not reached by the

05:14:02.160 --> 05:14:11.120
desired ada that the school has and the hole is getting deeper and deeper and deeper so i just

05:14:11.120 --> 05:14:19.040
bring all of that before you for consideration i will close with the statement that was made

05:14:19.040 --> 05:14:27.120
from our staff from the staff from laco any vote that we put forward today for a notice of violation

05:14:27.120 --> 05:14:33.520
is not closing the school it provides opportunity for the school to come back to the board

05:14:34.320 --> 05:14:40.160
provide additional information and then determination can be made on next steps from that point

05:14:41.280 --> 05:14:45.520
and i will conclude my comments and give the rest of the time to member oaken if

05:14:45.520 --> 05:14:51.040
i didn't take everything and i do i apologize i can always come up with something

05:14:51.600 --> 05:15:00.400
um i also want to thank all of our presenters today um this is a serious and um weighty

05:15:01.440 --> 05:15:09.920
um issue before us um as we listen to um the presentation from the school you hear so many

05:15:09.920 --> 05:15:18.320
positive impacts on kids and um you know that's ultimately what we're about and at the same time

05:15:18.320 --> 05:15:24.880
at the same time as the authorizer of this school we have a responsibility

05:15:26.000 --> 05:15:32.640
and so i want to just take a quick second to review what that responsibility is

05:15:33.360 --> 05:15:42.720
because it may be new to some of us so as we've heard this is a school that was authorized by us

05:15:42.720 --> 05:15:47.920
the state board and in fact it was one of the last charter schools that was authorized by the

05:15:47.920 --> 05:15:57.040
state board before ab 1505 changed our role as an authorizer um and as you can see uh as you heard

05:15:57.040 --> 05:16:04.640
la county office of education is the is providing the oversight and monitoring rather than the

05:16:04.640 --> 05:16:15.680
district um and this is the second time that we've had before us this um recommendation that we issue

05:16:15.680 --> 05:16:22.880
a notice of violation um so just to explain the statement explain the notice of violation

05:16:23.680 --> 05:16:28.960
all charter authorizers are required by ed code to notify their charter schools when a violation

05:16:28.960 --> 05:16:35.760
takes place and that's important because schools need to know when they are in serious jeopardy

05:16:37.360 --> 05:16:41.120
when the issue arises at one of the state board authorized charter schools

05:16:41.920 --> 05:16:45.280
the responsibility for issuing that notice of violation lies with us

05:16:47.280 --> 05:16:52.160
the board also has the obligation to provide its charter schools with a reasonable opportunity

05:16:52.160 --> 05:16:57.840
to address concerns so as we've heard a couple times this notice of violation would not mean

05:16:57.840 --> 05:17:03.200
that the school closes immediately it means that they would be back before us to try and address

05:17:03.200 --> 05:17:12.000
some of the issues that we heard today and specifically if we issue a notice of violation

05:17:12.000 --> 05:17:20.640
today time will appear will appear before our advisory the advisory commission on charter

05:17:20.640 --> 05:17:29.920
schools in april and to share their plans to address the issues that we heard about today

05:17:30.720 --> 05:17:36.480
they would also it would give them time and opportunity to demonstrate their plan

05:17:37.520 --> 05:17:40.960
and strategy for fiscal stability which is ultimately what this is about

05:17:42.000 --> 05:17:45.920
and so that's sort of the big picture and they would return before us in may

05:17:47.360 --> 05:17:54.400
it would allow time for the accs cde and laco to consider this the strengths of time's plan and

05:17:54.400 --> 05:17:59.440
return to the full board in may with a recommendation regarding next steps for us to consider

05:18:00.320 --> 05:18:07.600
all right that's the end of my comments all right and do we have any public comment in the room

05:18:08.800 --> 05:18:12.080
yes there is one person signed up for public comment thank you

05:18:15.920 --> 05:18:23.920
what a surprise i'm back all right um good afternoon state board of education members my

05:18:23.920 --> 05:18:27.680
name is lorraine richards and i'm a classroom teacher representing california teachers

05:18:27.680 --> 05:18:33.520
association i am also a teacher from monabella high school where time was co-located

05:18:34.240 --> 05:18:40.880
originally cta supports the cde recommendation to issue a notice of violation to time community

05:18:40.880 --> 05:18:47.360
school there is substantial evidence time has not engaged in prudent fiscal management and has failed

05:18:47.360 --> 05:18:52.720
to meet generally accepted accounting principles resulting in projected revenues that are

05:18:52.720 --> 05:18:59.760
insufficient to meet its operational expenses and financial commitments this will be the third

05:18:59.760 --> 05:19:04.880
instance in which time has been in front of the state board of education and each instance the

05:19:04.880 --> 05:19:10.960
cde has expressed significant concerns with their financial models the additional concerns regarding

05:19:10.960 --> 05:19:16.640
the personal loans made by the executive director to time are extremely troubling and the fact that

05:19:16.640 --> 05:19:24.240
the recent loan in january 2023 did not follow the adopted fiscal policies exasperates these

05:19:24.240 --> 05:19:30.640
concerns cta supports the cde recommendation to issue a notice of violation to time community

05:19:30.640 --> 05:19:38.720

hello good afternoon my name is alexandra soto and i'm a board member for time community school

05:20:56.640 --> 05:21:01.520
for three years that i have served on the board it has been an uphill battle for that we face

05:21:01.520 --> 05:21:07.680
and overcome year after year i have seen pcs go from being an idea to sharing physical space with

05:21:07.680 --> 05:21:13.520
a district school to standing on its own in the building it is located in now in a similar way

05:21:13.520 --> 05:21:19.120
that other industries are struggling coming out of this pandemic so our schools an analysis by

05:21:19.120 --> 05:21:24.720
the associated press stanford university big local news project and stanford education professor

05:21:24.720 --> 05:21:31.600
thomas d found an estimated 230 000 students in 21 states whose absences could not be accounted

05:21:31.600 --> 05:21:36.880
for they didn't move out of state they didn't sign up for private schools in short they're just

05:21:36.880 --> 05:21:43.360
missing and this is just schools all in general so you can understand that a school that was born

05:21:43.360 --> 05:21:49.440

the cde recommendation to issue a notice of violation to time community school time continues

05:23:14.000 --> 05:23:19.280
to be brought up before you for wrongdoing while co-locating at monabella high school the site in

05:23:19.280 --> 05:23:24.080
the district worked collaboratively to meet time's request however its inability to be responsible

05:23:24.080 --> 05:23:29.040
with their budget is leading to failed promises to students students that represent the community

05:23:29.040 --> 05:23:34.240
of monabella unified one of the many examples of failed compliance is time continues not to provide

05:23:34.240 --> 05:23:39.200
a counselor with the proper credentials issued by the state of california which was an issue of

05:23:39.200 --> 05:23:44.240
concern last time they came up to board this mismanagement of funds that brings time before

05:23:44.240 --> 05:23:48.480
you is taking away from students who represent some of the neediest in the state from being

05:23:48.480 --> 05:23:54.400

go ahead and start your public comment you are live

05:24:16.640 --> 05:24:20.560
thank you state board of education members my name is mrs. morenco and i'm the principal at

05:24:20.560 --> 05:24:25.680
monabella christian school i have a master's in education as well as as a bachelor's in business

05:24:25.680 --> 05:24:29.920
management economics i want to thank you in advance for your opportunity for my voice to be heard

05:24:29.920 --> 05:24:34.640
it is imperative that you understand what a positive impact time committee school has been

05:24:34.640 --> 05:24:39.280
in the monabella and la county community i think it's imperative parents have a choice in options

05:24:39.280 --> 05:24:43.840
on where to send their children for high school and time has been that choice for our own alumni

05:24:43.840 --> 05:24:48.160
students with a short time of existence time has been a place for our students to flourish

05:24:48.160 --> 05:24:52.400
have their voice heard and a place where they finally feel like they belong not everyone can

05:24:52.400 --> 05:24:56.720
afford a private education trust me i know and unfortunately the public high school options are

05:24:56.800 --> 05:25:02.880
slim and unappealing in our community and time has been literally a lifesaver for many of our

05:25:02.880 --> 05:25:07.520
graduates i leave you with my favorite quote flowers bloom where they find room and so do

05:25:07.520 --> 05:25:12.640
children and i urge you to vote no on the violation so the students can continue to attend time where

05:25:12.640 --> 05:25:16.880
they have found their room to flourish i also want to address the quote where it says that

05:25:16.880 --> 05:25:21.600
dr americh should be a good school leader thank you your time is up leaders need support i ask

05:25:21.600 --> 05:25:25.920
you to stand with him and be that support thank you thank you next caller please state your name

05:25:25.920 --> 05:25:28.880
and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time starts now

05:25:30.880 --> 05:25:34.640
hi my name is caving in i'm the assistant superintendent of educational services with

05:25:34.640 --> 05:25:38.800
the monabella unified school district i'm calling the comment on the notice of violation for time

05:25:38.800 --> 05:25:43.200
community school from the beginning of the proposition 39 process with time which began

05:25:43.200 --> 05:25:48.000
in november 2020 time barely met the minimum threshold for in-district students to qualify

05:25:48.000 --> 05:25:53.360
for prop 39 the district approved shared use of facilities with time to provide equal and comparable

05:25:53.360 --> 05:25:57.680
facilities equipment and furniture to time throughout the school year times enrollment

05:25:57.680 --> 05:26:02.480
did not meet their prop 39 projections in fact their enrollment declined the district went above

05:26:02.480 --> 05:26:06.560
and beyond to meet the requests that time had for facilities we installed new and separate network

05:26:06.560 --> 05:26:11.440
just for time installed a new phone system provided laptops to all students and staff rented a copy

05:26:11.440 --> 05:26:15.680
machine for the time administrative office and gave them microscopes for the science classes

05:26:15.680 --> 05:26:19.440
because of times under enrollment which caused them to have excess facilities the district was

05:26:19.440 --> 05:26:24.000
able to charge an over allocation fee to time per prop 39 however the district decided not

05:26:24.000 --> 05:26:29.200
to seek payment of approximately 230 000 in a way the district saved time close to a quarter

05:26:29.200 --> 05:26:34.080
of a million dollars to blame the decline in times enrollment or financial woes on the district is a

05:26:34.080 --> 05:26:38.480
fallacious argument thank you thank you next caller please state your name and affiliation

hi my name is dylan smith and i'm from charter school capital we've worked with time since just

05:27:10.800 --> 05:27:15.440
before they opened doors in fall of 2021 charter school capital as a financial partner does

05:27:15.440 --> 05:27:18.960
extensive underwriting areas of fiscal responsibility educational progress and

05:27:18.960 --> 05:27:23.520
authorized relations time has been proven to be an incredibly transparent and dedicated partner

05:27:23.520 --> 05:27:27.520
and shared the concerns of laco in the fall we did not feel they were true layers of concern

05:27:27.520 --> 05:27:32.480
as they would have triggered further underwriting processes and cessation of fundings from for the

05:27:32.480 --> 05:27:37.280
school until those concerns were alleviated dr ramirez and his leadership team have dealt with

05:27:37.280 --> 05:27:41.040
every challenge the start of charter school normally faces as well as a multitude of others

05:27:41.040 --> 05:27:44.880
every time they've experienced lower than expected enrollment they make the financial adjustments

05:27:44.880 --> 05:27:49.040
and share those updated budgets quickly and accurately we also evaluate those and feel the

05:27:49.040 --> 05:27:52.480
school has demonstrated positive fiscal management i also like to know the charter school capital

05:27:52.480 --> 05:27:56.240
consider purchasing the school's facility as is currently for sale and want to reiterate their

05:27:56.240 --> 05:28:00.000
lease is secure for the next for the full five-year term no matter who ends up purchasing the

05:28:00.000 --> 05:28:03.840
facility time has been a phenomenal member of his community with one of the strongest leadership

05:28:03.840 --> 05:28:08.880

i want to start by expressing my gratitude for being able to be a part of the dynamic team here

05:28:25.440 --> 05:28:30.240
what we are a part of at time is truly unlike anything i've seen we have an innovative model

05:28:30.240 --> 05:28:34.640
we are community oriented and we focus on building strong relationships with our students

05:28:34.640 --> 05:28:39.040
i take pride in the fact that we know each and every one of our students by name we know the

05:28:39.040 --> 05:28:43.600
challenges and struggles they face in and outside of the classroom and most importantly our students

05:28:43.600 --> 05:28:48.720
trust us time is a truly special school because our because of our pursuit of individualized

05:28:48.720 --> 05:28:53.920
learning which is the benefit of having a smaller school i urge the state board to vote no on the

05:28:53.920 --> 05:28:58.960
notice of violation and to support the operation of time to do otherwise would be a disservice to

05:28:58.960 --> 05:29:04.480

good afternoon president arnie hammond members of the board my name is nicholas watson speaking

05:29:15.520 --> 05:29:20.880
on behalf of the california charter schools association because they oppose the issuance

05:29:20.880 --> 05:29:25.920
of a notice of violation at time time was authorized in 2020 and has not yet completed

05:29:25.920 --> 05:29:30.400
the second year of operation during which time has been forced to overcome numerous obstacles

05:29:30.400 --> 05:29:35.440
including montevallo unified's refusal to provide a reasonably equivalent school facility

05:29:35.440 --> 05:29:41.440
and the refusal of montevallo and laco to allow time to fully access critical state funding programs

05:29:41.440 --> 05:29:46.000
including the public charter school grant program the charter school evolving loan program

05:29:46.080 --> 05:29:51.200
and the charter school facility grant program despite these challenges time is providing a

05:29:51.200 --> 05:29:55.760
quality public school option to students in need enrollment is increasing and time is working to

05:29:55.760 --> 05:30:00.640
address the financial challenges that have resulted from the school's inability to access

05:30:00.640 --> 05:30:05.200
funding programs available to other schools time should be able to continue the great work it's

05:30:05.200 --> 05:30:09.520

05:30:32.720 --> 05:30:37.360
community schools i have more than 25 years of experience and have assisted doctor minors with

05:30:37.360 --> 05:30:42.160
the establishment of many new community partnerships including the montevallo youth institute which

05:30:42.160 --> 05:30:47.680
includes a round table of over 20 very public organizations i want to say that the hypocrisy

05:30:47.680 --> 05:30:55.360
and and uh audacity of montevallo is staggering really enrollment seems to be down everywhere yet

05:30:55.360 --> 05:30:59.280
we're being told we're down in enrollment counselors there's protests in the streets

one minute your time starts now

yes how you doing my name is mike mendia my son is a current sophomore at time community

05:31:50.240 --> 05:31:54.480
this school has been a godson for my son's academic career and mental health my son's

05:31:54.480 --> 05:32:00.000
grades have went from straight s in the local school district to a's and b's at time the school

05:32:00.000 --> 05:32:05.280
and administrators have built up my son's self esteem and taken his academic success

05:32:05.280 --> 05:32:09.360
to a complete 180 he could not get any help in his previous schools no matter how many times

05:32:09.360 --> 05:32:14.240
we reached out the school has made a huge impact in his life right now as well as lighting fire

05:32:14.240 --> 05:32:18.640
under him to want to go to college the staff administrators have are always there to talk

05:32:19.360 --> 05:32:24.480
and the resources that provided tops here they truly care about each student individually

05:32:24.480 --> 05:32:28.560
his previous school just looked at my school as a number whereas time looked at a child whose

05:32:29.200 --> 05:32:33.760
skills were not tapped into and the and they have made such a positive impact in their life my

05:32:33.760 --> 05:32:39.200
child has flourished under their tutelage and will be impacted both academically and his mental

05:32:39.200 --> 05:32:43.600
health will take a huge hit if the school is taken away from him he used to have to go to therapy

05:32:43.600 --> 05:32:48.160
to cope with school since he started time he does not need a therapist or medications are for

05:32:48.160 --> 05:32:53.520
scrambling because if you get through school and i feel administrators are directly responsible

05:32:53.520 --> 05:32:59.280

in the montevallo area i want to express my enjoyment working with the students here at

05:33:26.640 --> 05:33:30.880
time the amount of enthusiasm and curiosity that pours out of this group of kids shows much how

05:33:30.880 --> 05:33:35.680
much they want to learn as a teacher it motivates me to be the best version of myself for them and i

05:33:35.680 --> 05:33:40.240
appreciate it i believe that closing or placing any kind of limitations on time community schools

05:33:40.240 --> 05:33:44.720
would be a disservice to its students this school provides a valuable educational experience for

05:33:44.720 --> 05:33:49.600
those that enroll and teachers and staff alike are dedicated to creating a safe and supportive

05:33:49.600 --> 05:33:54.720

good afternoon my name is marisol madrigal uribe and i'm a school board member for the

05:35:06.800 --> 05:35:11.200
montevallo unified school district because it does appear that time community school is attempting

05:35:11.200 --> 05:35:16.080
to blame part of its fiscal mismanagement on montevallo unified i do feel compelled to provide

05:35:16.080 --> 05:35:20.960
public comment on this matter the montevallo unified has always and we continue to abide by

05:35:20.960 --> 05:35:26.880
the requirements of proposition 39 to claim to claim that a failure to do otherwise is a direct

05:35:26.880 --> 05:35:32.160
to claim that a failure to do otherwise is a direct cause of times fiscal mismanagement

05:35:32.160 --> 05:35:37.440
is disingenuous and a continued attempt to shift blame rather than taking responsibility

05:35:37.440 --> 05:35:40.720
for its failure to recruit a sufficient number of students to its program

05:35:43.120 --> 05:35:49.120
as evidence um i'm sorry i'm just rather than to acknowledge that its program cannot draw nearly

05:35:49.120 --> 05:35:54.400
as many students as they would hope as evidenced by its continued struggles in its own facilities

05:35:54.480 --> 05:35:59.520
other public comments claim time's ability to recruit students was negatively impacted due

05:35:59.520 --> 05:36:04.720
to not being able to tell potential families where the school would be located this is simply

05:36:04.720 --> 05:36:11.440
untrue and was provided facilities foreign excess of the needs of its initial 17 in district ada

05:36:11.440 --> 05:36:17.520

Good afternoon. My name is Yi Lin and I am a CEO of Take a Break Events, a party planning service.

05:39:57.120 --> 05:40:03.360
I am also subleasing space within the school. First, I would like to say how much I enjoy

05:40:03.360 --> 05:40:10.640
working with Dr. Ramirez and the students of Time. In fact, the program is so amazing that I

05:40:10.640 --> 05:40:16.800
find myself volunteering my time and resources more and more each day. I know there are financial

05:40:16.800 --> 05:40:23.520
concerns for Time. However, I would like to share how I will be contributing to Time financial success.

05:40:24.080 --> 05:40:31.840
The base rent I am paying Time is $6,000. However, I am filling up my calendar with clients

05:40:31.840 --> 05:40:38.160
and soon I will be providing Time anywhere between $10,000 and $15,000 each month. Further,

05:40:38.160 --> 05:40:46.240
I am committed to introducing my family to Time as a school option because I want Time to succeed.

05:40:46.880 --> 05:40:56.800
Lastly, as a parent of a child who had an IEP, I want to say how happy I am that there is a

05:40:56.800 --> 05:41:05.200
school like Time. They really focus on the individual. Thank you. Next caller, please state

Hello. My name is Veronica Navarro. I am a union officer for the class of

05:41:20.080 --> 05:41:27.520
our employees in Montebello. I just wanted to express that we agree with the CBE recommendation.

05:41:27.520 --> 05:41:31.920
Thank you. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the

05:41:31.920 --> 05:41:40.960

05:41:40.960 --> 05:41:46.480
Montebello Chamber of Commerce. I am the director here. I am calling in support of Time Community

05:41:46.480 --> 05:41:52.080
School. They are a Chamber member and they have been very involved from the time that they moved

05:41:52.080 --> 05:41:59.920
here into the community. They have become a great asset for the Chamber. We do interns with their

05:41:59.920 --> 05:42:07.760
students and delightful children that come in to help out with anything that we need help with,

05:42:07.760 --> 05:42:14.240
social media, filing, etc. I know that other businesses in the community have also used them.

05:42:16.160 --> 05:42:25.280
On a personal level, I am in support of the Time Community School here in our community.

05:42:25.760 --> 05:42:35.280
Being a parent of a child with special needs in the past, it's nice to have another option for our

05:42:35.280 --> 05:42:42.080
students. Not all children. The curriculum in a public school is not always... Thank you. Your time

Hi, my name is Monica Maynard. I am a teacher with the Montebello Unified School District. I support

05:43:02.480 --> 05:43:10.720
science at Montebello High School. The district made prioritizations for the needs of the

05:43:10.720 --> 05:43:16.000
time students with equipment and space such as microscopes and classroom space. Since the last

05:43:16.000 --> 05:43:22.640
time that time came before you, they have had the time to improve their program to ensure that they

05:43:22.640 --> 05:43:27.360
provide students with the quality education that they deserve. The enrollment and the academic

05:43:27.360 --> 05:43:32.800
growth data is missing. Students should not be the casualty of fiscal mismanagement. This takes away

05:43:32.800 --> 05:43:38.880
from our community. I am a member of the Montebello community, support the CDE recommendation to issue

05:43:38.880 --> 05:43:44.080
a violation to Time Community School. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name

Hi, my name is Lamar Brown, president of Time Community School. Our school has made great

05:43:55.520 --> 05:43:59.360
strides and we have been extremely successful connecting with our community, our parents,

05:43:59.360 --> 05:44:03.680
and students. We have worked very hard to be the best school, and this is something we continue

05:44:03.680 --> 05:44:07.920
to dedicate our time to, to ensure not only the success of our students,

05:44:07.920 --> 05:44:14.560
but also the success of parents and the community. We have had unnecessary hurdles, but who doesn't?

05:44:14.560 --> 05:44:19.600
We continue to be dedicated. We continue to work hard. We continue to make great progress,

05:44:19.600 --> 05:44:25.520
and we continue to have success stories with our students, our community, and our parents.

05:44:25.520 --> 05:44:30.480

05:44:38.160 --> 05:44:42.400
My name is Iglali Spinoza. I am a student at Time Community Schools. I am a ninth grader,

05:44:42.400 --> 05:44:47.680
and I love this school. This school has given me the opportunity like taking college classes.

05:44:47.680 --> 05:44:54.320
We appreciate it in the clubs and every day. We get to be interns. This year I have been an

05:44:54.320 --> 05:45:01.520
intern for a tax company, and I learned so much. In fact, my experience has been so good that the

05:45:01.520 --> 05:45:08.800
owner wants to give me a job when I'm able. Time supports all students. They take the time to get

05:45:08.880 --> 05:45:13.520
to know us. They support us individually. Please support Time and vote no. Thank you.

05:45:14.160 --> 05:45:19.280
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You

Hi, my name is Teresa Lopez, and I'm a community activist in Moravello with Moravello Blue Hearts

05:45:41.040 --> 05:45:49.760
and Moravello Latino Unidos. And the reason is my call is to support the school because

05:45:50.400 --> 05:45:56.960
they have a very great program who can send a lot of the kids, other students to universities,

05:45:56.960 --> 05:46:01.840
which is that's going to increase the importance of education in our community. And I

05:46:02.560 --> 05:46:09.200
think they're doing a good job, and I'm here to support them. Thank you. Next caller,

05:46:09.200 --> 05:46:12.480
please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

05:46:16.080 --> 05:46:19.920
Hello, it's Eric Premack with the Charter Schools Development Center. Good afternoon

05:46:19.920 --> 05:46:24.400
to everybody. We understand you have a tough vote to take today. We really hope that

05:46:24.960 --> 05:46:29.920
when you do that, you will give direction to staff to take every step possible to see to it

05:46:29.920 --> 05:46:35.680
that the school receives the facilities, grants, and other funding that it deserves,

05:46:36.400 --> 05:46:42.400
and so that the school is in a much better position to turn its finances around. Also,

05:46:42.400 --> 05:46:48.640
bigger picture, we would urge the state board to reopen the regulations that govern the Prop 39

05:46:48.640 --> 05:46:55.040
program and insert the binding arbitration provisions so that disputes such as the ones that

05:46:55.040 --> 05:47:00.080
have made this school start problematic can be resolved in a much more

05:47:01.120 --> 05:47:07.680
cost-effective and timely fashion. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, that concludes public comment

05:47:07.680 --> 05:47:17.120
for item number 10. Thank you very much. At this point, we're open for board discussion.

05:47:25.040 --> 05:47:31.360
Thank you. Member Lewis, are you moving your microphone because you wanted to speak?

05:47:32.400 --> 05:47:37.200
I just appreciate all the callers calling in, and I think it's so touching to hear from the students

05:47:37.200 --> 05:47:43.840
and the passion they have from the school. Just looking at, I appreciate the report by the LA

05:47:43.840 --> 05:47:49.760
County Office of Education and the CDE staff that really laid out the picture of what's physically

05:47:50.640 --> 05:47:58.240
going on at the school, and I think I appreciate the framing comments from Vice President Glover

05:47:58.240 --> 05:48:07.600
Woods that if you do take a vote today to issue the notice of violation, that it doesn't mean

05:48:07.600 --> 05:48:12.240
we're closing the school, that we give them an opportunity to come back before us. So again,

05:48:12.240 --> 05:48:16.560
thank you. I think the joy is hearing from the kids and the success that they're having.

05:48:20.640 --> 05:48:21.680
Senator Glover Woods?

05:48:23.920 --> 05:48:31.040
I'd like to preface. I'd actually like to make a motion, but preface my motion with thank you to

05:48:31.040 --> 05:48:38.080
the parents and to the students that called in, also again to the executive director of the school.

05:48:38.720 --> 05:48:45.680
The school is based upon those comments making impact for students, and the goal of the

05:48:45.680 --> 05:48:52.720
conversation today is really to ensure that it's still able to do so. So with that being said,

05:48:54.320 --> 05:49:05.360
I move that we vote to issue a notice of violation to time pursuant education code 47607G.

05:49:06.000 --> 05:49:14.640
Is there a second? I move Rodriguez. Is there any further discussion?

05:49:18.320 --> 05:49:25.600
I'll just associate myself with the comments that we really do appreciate the

05:49:26.800 --> 05:49:33.760
virtues that the school has been able to pull together, that we also hope that whatever

05:49:33.760 --> 05:49:38.640
opportunities can be made available to them to continue the work will be made available, and we

05:49:39.280 --> 05:49:48.240
will proceed on the basis of the unfortunate finances that we have had presented before us.

05:49:50.080 --> 05:49:56.240
Any further discussion? If not, I'll call for the vote. All in favor of the motion as stated,

05:49:56.240 --> 05:50:05.440
say aye. Aye. Aye. Any opposed? Any abstention? The motion carries, and we will

05:50:06.800 --> 05:50:12.080
continue a pace, and if anyone needs to take a break, please take an individual break,

05:50:13.200 --> 05:50:20.080
and we'll see you when you come back. We're going to put the public's comment slide up again,

05:50:20.240 --> 05:50:29.280
and we're going to do, this is for general public comment. This is for any members of the public

05:50:29.280 --> 05:50:35.760
wishing to provide comment on items that have not been on the board's agenda. Are there any

05:50:35.760 --> 05:50:41.520
speakers signed up to provide public comment in person? Yes, there are two people signed up for

05:50:41.520 --> 05:50:44.320
general public comment. Okay, thank you very much.

05:50:50.080 --> 05:51:10.960
Good afternoon, board president and members. My name is Wilda Lee. I attended public schools in

05:51:10.960 --> 05:51:19.440
LA County, California in the 80s. To add a tiny drop into a vast ocean of success stories,

05:51:19.440 --> 05:51:25.440
I'd like to mention that I have two master's degrees. I received a graduate certificate

05:51:25.440 --> 05:51:33.280
in theology, and I have a private pilot license. I had a very dedicated, super dedicated English

05:51:33.280 --> 05:51:40.640
teacher who, when I was in school, mentioned that because they voted God out of school,

05:51:40.640 --> 05:51:46.960
that he couldn't. He had to figure out how to introduce some of the life-defining guiding truths

05:51:47.600 --> 05:51:54.960
into our curriculum, sorry, that which I longed for all semester I did. And then the story of

05:51:55.520 --> 05:52:01.760
seeing guards that were never saw in school yards. So today, I'm very grateful for all the

05:52:01.760 --> 05:52:07.360
educational opportunities I've had. I just wish I didn't have to feel like something deep and

05:52:07.360 --> 05:52:13.760
profound was missing in my school education because God, God our creator was rejected,

05:52:14.480 --> 05:52:17.040
and the seemingly reality. Thank you. Your time is up.

05:52:24.000 --> 05:52:27.840
Thank you. We have another commenter. Yes.

05:52:30.400 --> 05:52:36.800
Hi, my name is Hezekiah. Peace be with you all. And I'm here, my objective is to get people to

05:52:36.800 --> 05:52:42.480
recognize that the reason for the growing violence and the mass shootings that have been occurring in

05:52:42.480 --> 05:52:49.040
our society and in our schools are because people have failed to acknowledge God, our creator,

05:52:49.040 --> 05:52:54.480
and I hold there is one God who is the creator of the world, that he's both good and just,

05:52:54.480 --> 05:52:58.960
good in the sense of giving his air, water, and sun to all of us here, good and evil,

05:52:58.960 --> 05:53:03.760
yet he's also just in that he judges everyone at some point in time according to their deeds.

05:53:04.720 --> 05:53:11.200
Now, 3100 people have been shot in mass shootings in 2022 alone,

05:53:12.240 --> 05:53:16.080
which has been recorded as among the highest in history according to CNN.

05:53:17.280 --> 05:53:25.280
And since Columbine in 1999, more than 338,000 students in the US have been experiencing

05:53:25.280 --> 05:53:32.000
gun violence at school. And in 2022 alone, 34 students and adults died while more than

05:53:32.080 --> 05:53:38.000
43,000 children were exposed to gunfire at school according to the Washington Post.

05:53:41.840 --> 05:53:46.480
President Hammond, we've been waiting all day. Do you mind if I have just a couple more moments?

05:53:46.480 --> 05:53:56.320
I'm almost done. Thank you. What a child is taught does make a difference. And when a child is taught

05:53:56.320 --> 05:54:02.480
that they come from the same ancestor as an ape 10 million years ago, why do we expect our children

05:54:02.480 --> 05:54:07.520
not to act like apes? But to the contrary, when our children are taught that they're made in the

05:54:07.520 --> 05:54:13.280
marvelous image of God and that God sees all things and judges each person, that can help

05:54:13.280 --> 05:54:19.360
brittle the lusts of evil actions in our society. There's no evidence that we came from apes,

05:54:19.360 --> 05:54:25.200
but we do have evidence of God by the fact of us being made in his image. Thank you.

05:54:26.400 --> 05:54:34.320
More sentences there. Appreciate that. At this point, we are going to reopen

05:54:34.320 --> 05:54:41.440
item two to take action on the preliminary report of actions draft January 2023 meeting minutes

05:54:42.160 --> 05:54:47.120
to take up appointments to the advisory commission on special education and to report on our liaison

05:54:47.120 --> 05:54:54.480
assignments. And again, we have the public comment slide up while we're waiting for any members.

05:54:56.560 --> 05:55:03.360
Oh, there's more on the phone. I'm sorry. Yeah. Is there more public comment on the phone?

05:55:03.360 --> 05:55:08.640
There is one person on the line, although I think they spoke towards the last item,

05:55:08.640 --> 05:55:14.320
but I will answer it. Okay. Thank you. Good afternoon. Please state your name

05:55:14.320 --> 05:55:17.680
and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

05:55:17.680 --> 05:55:28.000
Hi, this comment was for the item W03 sale of or lease surplus property by a Hayward Unified

05:55:28.000 --> 05:55:32.960
School District. Good afternoon, members of the board. My name is Yun Chang and I'm speaking on

05:55:32.960 --> 05:55:43.040
behalf of the Key Academy Charter School. One of the sites listed in the Hayward Unified School District.

05:55:43.040 --> 05:55:47.680
Pardon me. I'm sorry, caller. Unfortunately, this is on this general public comment,

05:55:47.680 --> 05:55:51.760
so it's only comment on items that were not agendized. You would have had to call in for

05:55:51.760 --> 05:55:58.880
the waiver item to speak to that item. Thank you very much. I meant to call. I meant to call,

05:55:58.880 --> 05:56:08.400
but then somehow the web live was a lot, I mean, delayed, so I wasn't able to call in time for the

05:56:08.400 --> 05:56:13.840
request. I apologize. The action's been taken.

05:56:18.560 --> 05:56:25.760
All right. Any other, anybody else on the phone line or we'll move ahead. Okay. We're reopening

05:56:25.760 --> 05:56:31.440
item two to take action on the preliminary report of actions draft January, 2023 meeting minutes,

05:56:32.000 --> 05:56:36.160
take up appointments to the advisory commission on special education and report

05:56:36.160 --> 05:56:45.040
on our liaison assignments. And I think we need to put the public comments slide up yet again

05:56:46.640 --> 05:56:53.040
for one of these later items. Yes. When we get to the special education advisory commission.

05:56:54.080 --> 05:57:00.560
And while we're waiting on that queue to form, do I have an emotion to approve the January, 2023

05:57:01.200 --> 05:57:05.760
state board of education draft preliminary report of actions slash meeting minutes?

05:57:06.160 --> 05:57:12.320
Remember all good. All right. Thank you very much. And the motion is seconded by board member

05:57:12.320 --> 05:57:22.080
Alaska Gonzalez. And is there any public comment? No public comment. Okay. Any further discussion?

05:57:23.120 --> 05:57:30.800
All those in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Any abstentions? All right. Motion carries.

05:57:31.520 --> 05:57:35.760
I'm going to ask vice president Glover woods as chair of the state board screening committee

05:57:36.640 --> 05:57:42.880
committee's recommendations for the appointments to the ACSE. And the public comments slide goes

05:57:42.880 --> 05:57:51.280
back up again. And when after you've provided your overview, we will then go back to public comment.

05:57:52.080 --> 05:57:58.640
Thank you, president Darling Hammond. I preface my comment by thanking everyone who applied for the

05:57:58.640 --> 05:58:04.880
seats on the ACSE. Thank you so much for your interest. The screening committee would like

05:58:04.880 --> 05:58:11.600
to recommend the appointment of the following individuals to a four year term for the ACSE.

05:58:12.640 --> 05:58:16.320
Russell mitchell and I apologize if I mispronounced your name, sir,

05:58:16.960 --> 05:58:23.040
who will be representing charter schools and Matthew Wilkins, who will be representing

05:58:23.040 --> 05:58:34.240
parent of a child with disabilities. And do we have any public comment in the room or on the phone?

05:58:35.520 --> 05:58:42.880
There is no one in the room. Sign up for public comment. And no one on the phone.

05:58:46.320 --> 05:58:53.040
Is there anyone on the phone? We do not. All right. I'll ask members Lewis and Escobedo,

05:58:53.040 --> 05:58:58.240
who also served on this year's screening committee, if they have any initial comments for us.

05:58:58.240 --> 05:59:11.440
No, we just had just an amazing number of participants that we had to review and screen

05:59:12.720 --> 05:59:19.040
just so many worthy candidates and really appreciate all those who submitted their

05:59:19.040 --> 05:59:25.600
paperwork and appreciate the team. I believe this is our final round. Perhaps we'll see,

05:59:25.600 --> 05:59:29.520
but it's just great working with this amazing team. So thank you.

05:59:32.240 --> 05:59:32.960
Say ditto.

05:59:36.000 --> 05:59:39.760
Well, we're fortunate to have so many people willing to contribute their time

05:59:40.560 --> 05:59:47.200
and knowledge and expertise to our commission. So thank you very much for reviewing and recommending.

05:59:48.720 --> 05:59:52.560
So we're open for board discussion. Is there any further discussion on this item?

05:59:52.560 --> 05:59:59.600
And if not, may I get a motion to adopt the recommendations of the screening committee?

06:00:01.600 --> 06:00:05.040
I move that the board accept the recommended

06:00:05.600 --> 06:00:13.520
appointees for the ACSC. I get it. Thank you. Did you catch that? All right. All in favor say aye.

06:00:14.400 --> 06:00:22.080
Aye. Any opposed? Any abstentions? The motion passes. Thank you so much Vice President Glover

06:00:22.080 --> 06:00:29.760
Woods and members Escobedo and Lewis for that review work. And now I want to invite our

06:00:30.640 --> 06:00:35.440
state board members to report on their liaison activities that are not related to items on the

06:00:35.440 --> 06:00:44.080
March agenda. And I'm going to go in alphabetical order starting with member Escobedo and then down

06:00:44.080 --> 06:00:51.200
the alphabet. I just want to remind the board that I'm part of the planning committee and meeting with

06:00:52.480 --> 06:00:59.680
NASVY, the National School Board Association on this Tuesday. So if you have any items you'd

06:00:59.680 --> 06:01:05.360
like to see in our annual October meeting, which will be held in San Diego, please, please send me

06:01:06.080 --> 06:01:15.120
send me an email. As part of my duties with Wested, CEO Glenn Harvey after I believe

06:01:16.080 --> 06:01:23.120
been in that position for over almost two decades, maybe three decades. She is

06:01:23.120 --> 06:01:33.200
retiring and so we're working on obtaining a search firm to find a CEO for Wested. As you

06:01:33.200 --> 06:01:39.680
well know Wested is one of the premier research organizations and they've done a lot of great

06:01:39.680 --> 06:01:46.720
work here in California as well as other states such as such as Arizona and Nevada and so forth.

06:01:46.720 --> 06:01:52.640
So that is all I have to report. Thank you. Vice President Glover Woods.

06:01:54.640 --> 06:02:02.080
Thank you President Darling-Hammond. Just two quick updates. One for the Instructional Quality

06:02:02.080 --> 06:02:08.400
Commission. Member Lewis and I had an opportunity to attend the January 25th and 26th meeting.

06:02:08.400 --> 06:02:13.680
The first day was a phenomenal one for the commissioners to get to know themselves and

06:02:13.680 --> 06:02:18.880
to get to know their work. There were a lot of wonderful orientation activities and again kudos

06:02:18.880 --> 06:02:28.800
to the CDE staff, Dr. Torres and others for that work. We also took time to issue the oath of office

06:02:28.800 --> 06:02:36.480
to the newest commissioners as well during that time and Lily Jarvis was selected as the chair

06:02:37.200 --> 06:02:42.560
for one year term. Lindsay Gotanda for vice chair will serve as vice chair.

06:02:44.320 --> 06:02:49.920
As it relates to the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence, I just want to share with

06:02:49.920 --> 06:02:57.440
the board that the CCEE continues to work diligently to provide support to our LEAs and

06:02:57.440 --> 06:03:02.720
others in the state. The Community Engagement Initiative is in its third year of implementation

06:03:02.720 --> 06:03:10.960
and is continuing to provide support as is designed and they are utilizing improvement

06:03:10.960 --> 06:03:15.920
science and they are developing a plan for community and family engagement and currently

06:03:15.920 --> 06:03:21.920
they're supporting over 600,000 students. They are also working, CCE is also working on the

06:03:21.920 --> 06:03:28.080
Learning Acceleration Systems Grant and there are three grantee projects that are contributing to

06:03:28.080 --> 06:03:36.480
those sustainable learning networks. And lastly, the CCEE is continuing to facilitate support for

06:03:36.480 --> 06:03:43.520
the statewide system of support and continuing to work to build coherence amongst all of those

06:03:43.520 --> 06:03:50.720
entities of the statewide system of support. That concludes my update for the CCEE. Thank you,

06:03:50.720 --> 06:04:02.320
Member Lewis. As Vice President Glover Woods mentioned, the California Department of Education

06:04:03.200 --> 06:04:09.920
facilitated a discussion to solicit input on potential edits to the current IQC bylaws which

06:04:09.920 --> 06:04:17.360
had not been amended since 2012 and they were given a summary of the bylaws and had the

06:04:17.360 --> 06:04:22.720
opportunity to suggest amendments which they will bring back to the meeting next Tuesday on

06:04:22.720 --> 06:04:31.280
March 15th. There was a lot of valuable input provided regarding the virtual meeting options

06:04:31.280 --> 06:04:41.360
for the future and also, oh I'm so sorry, he's in my key voice, sorry. Okay, can you again,

06:04:42.000 --> 06:04:50.720
the members of the commission submitted suggestions for revisions to the bylaws that included

06:04:50.720 --> 06:04:56.480
amending language about the student member and also virtual meeting options and language related

06:04:56.480 --> 06:05:04.080
to increased collaboration with the state board. It was a very rich discussion and if the IQC

06:05:04.080 --> 06:05:08.720
determines that further edits are needed during the March meeting next week, then

06:05:10.240 --> 06:05:15.520
SBE action may take place in July instead of at our May meeting. Otherwise, they'll be brought

06:05:15.520 --> 06:05:24.000
to our May meeting. I think that's it. Member McQuillan, and I'll remind everyone to use your

06:05:24.000 --> 06:05:32.960
mics. Yes, I'll be brief. My report is on the California Workforce Pathways Joint Advisory

06:05:32.960 --> 06:05:41.680
Committee. The overview is the Joint Pathways Advisory Committee, C-W-P-J-A-C, and I'll only

06:05:41.680 --> 06:05:48.160
say that once, is a collaborative between California Department of Ed, CD, and the California

06:05:48.160 --> 06:05:57.920
Community Colleges Chancellor's Office, CCCCO. The committee meets quarterly and works to address

06:05:57.920 --> 06:06:04.880
systems alignment policies specific to career pathways within the context of recent and future

06:06:04.880 --> 06:06:13.120
state and federal investments. I think of the two electric cars I drove in to get here from way up

06:06:13.120 --> 06:06:19.440
north and who's going to work on those in the future, and I think of the problems I had on

06:06:19.440 --> 06:06:26.000
getting on the computer this morning, you know, the folks who are going to work on those in the

06:06:26.000 --> 06:06:30.800
future, and then our health care and my own health, my family's health, and the skills-based

06:06:30.800 --> 06:06:34.640
positions for that. That's what we're talking about when we're talking about CTE.

06:06:37.440 --> 06:06:45.040
One of the primary areas of focus for the 22-23 committee is to provide guidance on the draft

06:06:45.040 --> 06:06:50.880
California State Plan for CTE. Note this plan is different from California's

06:06:51.600 --> 06:07:01.680
20-23 Federal Perkins V State Plan. The plan we're talking about aligns all state funded CTE

06:07:01.680 --> 06:07:09.440
initiatives. The draft plan will go before the committee on March 10th. Tomorrow we have a

06:07:09.440 --> 06:07:20.320
meeting for approval, and then the CCCCO, the Chancellor's Office, will present the approved

06:07:20.320 --> 06:07:26.320
plan as an informational item to the Board of Governors meeting. This summer we'll kick off

06:07:29.040 --> 06:07:31.440
state-level activities in support of the plan.

06:07:34.240 --> 06:07:41.680
This year there was $300 million allocated or available for allocation from CTIG funds.

06:07:41.920 --> 06:07:53.920
In our January meeting, we approved 375 grantees or $265 million to go out to LEAs.

06:07:54.880 --> 06:08:01.120
Because funds continue to be available, there was an 8B round, which we just approved in our

06:08:01.120 --> 06:08:08.160
consent agenda today, which was five new applicants. And that's all I have to say. Thank you.

06:08:08.160 --> 06:08:11.280
Thank you very much. Member Olken.

06:08:13.760 --> 06:08:22.560
Thank you. So I am, one of my, a new assignment is I'm the liaison to environmental literacy

06:08:22.560 --> 06:08:30.240
for the state. I mentioned that briefly last month. And due to the climate experience we're

06:08:30.240 --> 06:08:36.080
having, I'm going to keep my comments about environmental literacy short. Thank you for

06:08:36.080 --> 06:08:45.520
getting the humor there. Yeah. So it's been really exciting to get my arms around the work

06:08:45.520 --> 06:08:53.040
that's going on related to environmental literacy in the state. And as we come together every month

06:08:53.040 --> 06:08:58.880
that it's clearer and clearer why this work matters. And so just to give a quick framework

06:08:58.880 --> 06:09:05.520
around the type of work that's happening, there's sort of three big buckets. There's work that's

06:09:05.520 --> 06:09:12.000
related to environmental literacy itself, what students are learning, experiencing,

06:09:13.120 --> 06:09:19.200
how they're understanding the role they can play in relation to the environment and

06:09:19.200 --> 06:09:23.440
long-term sustainability. So that's sort of classroom-based, curriculum-based,

06:09:23.440 --> 06:09:32.160
experience-based. There's also work that's related to how the system of schools,

06:09:32.160 --> 06:09:38.560
think about all the buildings and buses and concrete yards that we have contribute,

06:09:39.840 --> 06:09:43.040
can contribute in a positive way or can continue to

06:09:44.000 --> 06:09:50.400
degrade our environment. So there's sort of the bucket around buildings and grounds

06:09:50.400 --> 06:09:56.400
and the footprint of schools. And then I think a through line and all of the work is related to

06:09:56.400 --> 06:10:03.360
environmental justice and the ways in which we need to look at the different experiences

06:10:03.360 --> 06:10:10.240
of our young people in different communities in relation to the types of environmental impacts

06:10:11.040 --> 06:10:14.640
and climate change that they're facing, the types of experiences that they're having

06:10:15.600 --> 06:10:22.800
to grow their critical thinking and their opportunities as parts of the solution.

06:10:23.760 --> 06:10:29.040
And specifically in the, so that's the big picture. I think the part I'm supposed to be

06:10:30.000 --> 06:10:36.720
focusing on specifically is related to the first bucket, what's happening in classrooms. And so

06:10:38.400 --> 06:10:44.800
as a result of, in California, the work around environmental literacy and

06:10:46.160 --> 06:10:50.960
climate change in our classrooms has been going on a long time, but there's been some very specific

06:10:52.880 --> 06:11:01.920
work recently. Most recently in the budget act of 2021, $6 million were appropriated.

06:11:02.560 --> 06:11:06.240
Actually, I'm not sure if that's the right language. There were $6 million set aside

06:11:07.200 --> 06:11:12.000
to create K through 12 standards-based curriculum that would be free for

06:11:14.560 --> 06:11:20.960
schools across the state in grades, in grade levels K through 12. And so I started

06:11:21.600 --> 06:11:28.080
attending the meetings that are quarterly to oversee that work and to sort of check

06:11:28.080 --> 06:11:35.920
in about where it's going. And it's really incredible work with partners around the state

06:11:35.920 --> 06:11:43.040
who are developing a unit at each grade level that will be supporting hands-on problem-based,

06:11:43.760 --> 06:11:52.960
rich experience-based curriculum. And so I'll continue to share out on that as we continue.

06:11:53.920 --> 06:11:59.280
And I'm going to talk quickly about two other things. One is I'm continuing to attend and

06:11:59.280 --> 06:12:06.960
participate in meetings related to the statewide IEP template that we're working to develop. And

06:12:07.920 --> 06:12:15.680
that's incredible work with the goal of ensuring that as a state, we have a consistent way of

06:12:17.840 --> 06:12:24.080
leading, documenting, and thinking about our team meetings to support our students with

06:12:24.080 --> 06:12:30.400
disabilities. And we have a full day retreat coming in June to continue that work. And so

06:12:30.400 --> 06:12:35.200
I'll report out on that further. And then the last thing is when we were

06:12:37.680 --> 06:12:43.200
talking about the state seal of civic engagement, and also some of our work yesterday when we were

06:12:43.200 --> 06:12:51.440
talking about the assessments and performance tasks that are real world and get kids and young

06:12:51.440 --> 06:12:56.320
people excited about the work and seeing their relevance in the real world, it reminded me of

06:12:56.320 --> 06:13:01.760
a couple of sessions I've been to recently that were put on by the early math initiative

06:13:01.760 --> 06:13:09.360
in California led by some folks in the room. But where they're really trying to,

06:13:10.720 --> 06:13:17.280
the most recent seminar, the tagline was play more, learn more. And so it's really about how do we

06:13:17.280 --> 06:13:23.920
help students see themselves as mathematicians and scientists and problem solvers. There's an

06:13:23.920 --> 06:13:31.920
activity, there is a video of, well, there's an activity where we all built ramps and rolled

06:13:31.920 --> 06:13:39.520
things down them to show even for our youngest learners that they can understand and make

06:13:41.360 --> 06:13:50.400
educated guesses around complicated mathematical and scientific standards. So it's just really

06:13:50.400 --> 06:13:55.920
good stuff, and I'm excited to be part of it. Thank you. Member Rusko Gonzalez.

06:13:57.680 --> 06:14:06.960
Well, yesterday I shared out quite a bit on assessments, and Member Olken actually said

06:14:06.960 --> 06:14:12.320
a little bit about what my gem of yesterday was. So I just wanted to share out that part, which is

06:14:12.320 --> 06:14:19.680
I always say gem because it's like the highlight of the day. My gem of the day in the assessment

06:14:19.680 --> 06:14:23.920
system should be designed to be culturally responsive and to ensure that every student

06:14:23.920 --> 06:14:29.680
can see themselves in the assessment experience and that it guides teachers in the class on how

06:14:29.680 --> 06:14:35.920
to tailor instruction. And I loved the experience of having that study session because I think

06:14:35.920 --> 06:14:43.120
it allows all the members to participate in the experience and to give input and we can all learn

06:14:43.120 --> 06:14:50.400
from dialogue and collaboration, so great experience. Thank you. Member Patillo Bronson.

06:14:51.840 --> 06:14:56.160
I'm going to try and hold to the one-minute rule that other public comments have to do.

06:14:57.760 --> 06:15:04.880
If we do that, we'll make it by three. The Universal Pre-K Mixed Delivery Quality and

06:15:04.880 --> 06:15:11.280
Access Workgroup has met twice now since the new year, and I'll flag two trends which I think are

06:15:11.280 --> 06:15:17.280
really powerful for us to consider in future meetings. One is that as focus groups were done

06:15:17.280 --> 06:15:23.120
for parents, psychological and emotional safety was named the highest priority of incoming parents

06:15:24.160 --> 06:15:30.480
where parents themselves asked, is this a setting where my child may face the same racism or

06:15:30.480 --> 06:15:35.920
discrimination that I have faced? And that's just powerful to grapple with, especially in a 60-second

06:15:35.920 --> 06:15:42.720
format. The other thing that they have uncovered is that there are wide disparities in terms of

06:15:42.720 --> 06:15:47.840
child outcomes depending on setting, and I think it sets up thinking about the different systems

06:15:47.840 --> 06:15:53.600
of support that exist in the K-12 system that also could be brought to bear in early childhood and

06:15:53.600 --> 06:15:58.480
early learning. And then the last is a quick update on the California State Summer School

06:15:58.480 --> 06:16:05.920
for the Arts, which the headline is, they are back. In person this summer, they had a significant

06:16:05.920 --> 06:16:11.280
dip in enrollment and applications during the pandemic, and they came back with a roaring

06:16:11.840 --> 06:16:18.720
almost 40% increase in applicants and will be at effectively the same enrollment numbers as they

06:16:18.720 --> 06:16:25.200
were pre-pandemic. And that brings my report to a close. Perfect. Thank you. Lots of good news there.

06:16:26.160 --> 06:16:29.920
Member Porter. Thank you so much President Darling-Hammond. Good afternoon board members

06:16:29.920 --> 06:16:34.400
and members of the public. One of my main goals as a student board member this year was to further

06:16:34.400 --> 06:16:40.400
connect student board members to each other and to educate students about ways to take initiative

06:16:40.400 --> 06:16:45.760
and full advantage of opportunities. So first, I was able to meet with over 200 students from

06:16:45.760 --> 06:16:50.960
Los Angeles Unified School District, Corona Norco Unified School District, and Fremont Unified

06:16:51.040 --> 06:16:56.720
School District to get that diverse perspective of student voices from across the state. I was

06:16:56.720 --> 06:17:01.200
also able to connect with state student board members from Pennsylvania and Maryland to discuss

06:17:01.200 --> 06:17:07.520
different methods of advocacy. Second, I presented at CASCS Region 10 Conference to 58 high school

06:17:07.520 --> 06:17:14.080
students at the Orange County Office of Education, where I facilitated two sessions about leadership,

06:17:14.080 --> 06:17:20.000
building teams, starting nonprofits, and how to find one's passion and turn it into someone's

06:17:20.000 --> 06:17:24.720
life purpose. Lastly, one of the highlights of the past few months was being guest teacher

06:17:24.720 --> 06:17:32.080
at the LAUSD Science Academy STEM Magnet School, where I presented to 430 middle and high school

06:17:32.080 --> 06:17:37.760
students about the intersection between science, education, and taking initiative. I received

06:17:37.760 --> 06:17:43.440
questions about my position on the SBE ranging from how public comment shapes policy priorities

06:17:43.440 --> 06:17:48.320
from a high school senior to my favorite question from a sixth grader, can I fit in your suitcase

06:17:48.320 --> 06:18:00.000
to Sacramento? And that concludes my report. Member Rodriguez. Thank you. And did you bring

06:18:00.000 --> 06:18:06.960
the sixth grader? Not this time. We haven't checked. Good afternoon board members and members of the

06:18:06.960 --> 06:18:13.600
public. I have a few short CTC related updates. Last month the CTC heard a very informative

06:18:13.600 --> 06:18:19.360
presentation from staff in West Ed on California's implementation of teacher residencies.

06:18:19.360 --> 06:18:24.160
Residencies are a collaboration between LEAs and educator preparation programs

06:18:24.160 --> 06:18:30.480
to create a hands-on preparation experience alongside a mentor teacher. And research establishes

06:18:30.480 --> 06:18:35.280
that residency prepared teachers are better prepared to teach diverse students and are more

06:18:35.280 --> 06:18:41.120
likely to stay in the classroom. Residents in California are racially diverse and are being

06:18:41.120 --> 06:18:47.280
prepared in several credential areas including special education. West Ed has launched a residency

06:18:47.280 --> 06:18:53.680
dashboard and the CTC item itself has rich data on student demographics, completion rates,

06:18:53.680 --> 06:18:59.200
and stipends being provided to teacher candidates. It's very exciting that soon the CTC will select

06:18:59.200 --> 06:19:07.360
a residency TA center. The RFA is due on Friday to support statewide implementation. The CTC also

06:19:07.360 --> 06:19:11.280
reviewed and adopted the literacy program standards and teaching performance

06:19:12.160 --> 06:19:17.600
expectations for education specialists. Credential to teach literacy to students with visual

06:19:17.600 --> 06:19:23.200
impairments, the deaf and hard of hearing. Experts and advocates for these unique learners were

06:19:23.200 --> 06:19:29.360
consulted through focus groups and came to inform the commission staff. Incredible work in this area.

06:19:29.360 --> 06:19:35.200
It means a lot when the legislature directs the CTC to update its literacy standards. The next step

06:19:35.200 --> 06:19:41.520
in assembly bill 488 implementation will be preparing the new literacy performance assessment

06:19:42.080 --> 06:19:48.640
for field teaching for the myriad of credential holders who will be able to take this improved

06:19:48.640 --> 06:19:53.920
assessment of their ability to teach literacy. And this item was incredibly humbling for me by the way.

06:19:55.520 --> 06:20:03.200
Lastly as you know I'm on the NASB PEP public education position committee and we chose our

06:20:03.200 --> 06:20:09.200
the items that we'll be exploring and presenting at the conference in October in San Diego that

06:20:09.200 --> 06:20:13.360
member Escobedo referred to. And we chose accountability, accreditation, and school

06:20:13.360 --> 06:20:19.040
improvement. Rethinking state accountability systems, designing student academic and non-academic

06:20:19.040 --> 06:20:24.160
measures, developing school quality indicators, and supporting school continuous improvement.

06:20:24.160 --> 06:20:31.360
And these are national so there we come together and present these to NASB. And then the second

06:20:31.440 --> 06:20:37.600
item is high school redesign which I'm on this team. Graduation pathways, graduation requirements,

06:20:38.160 --> 06:20:43.680
and course taking patterns, career and college readiness. The same day right before the PEP

06:20:43.680 --> 06:20:48.800
meeting I was invited in my role as teacher and SBE member to participate in NASB's office hours.

06:20:49.440 --> 06:20:55.840
There was a presentation by Educators Thriving, an organization in partnership with AFT has designed

06:20:55.840 --> 06:21:01.520
a survey tool to define the most predictive factors of educator well-being and help measure

06:21:01.520 --> 06:21:07.600
educator well-being to inform policies and practices to support and sustain educator well-being.

06:21:07.600 --> 06:21:12.720
The organization is working with several school districts across the country and in our state

06:21:12.720 --> 06:21:18.000
to implement professional development for educators that is meaningful and increases

06:21:18.000 --> 06:21:23.040
their well-being and they're also working with induction programs. The presentation covered the

06:21:23.040 --> 06:21:29.920
latest survey findings. The six most predictive factors of educator well-being. They shared how

06:21:29.920 --> 06:21:35.200
educator wellness is important for attracting and retaining teachers and the ways in which

06:21:35.200 --> 06:21:42.000
policymakers can use this data to inform policy making and ensure that local districts work to

06:21:42.000 --> 06:21:48.800
ensure PD that matches what the educators need and desire. And the six predictors, and I'll end with

06:21:48.800 --> 06:21:54.960
this, responsive leadership, supportive culture, acceptance, adaptability, professional growth

06:21:54.960 --> 06:22:02.240
orientation, personal well-being, and absence of depletion. Thank you so much. That concludes my

06:22:02.240 --> 06:22:06.080
report. Thank you so much. Member Yoshimoto-Towry.

06:22:10.480 --> 06:22:16.880
Hi. So I have two reports today. Again, brief. English learners, our regional English learner

06:22:17.600 --> 06:22:25.120
specialists were in person in Sacramento in February 15 and they had a chance to talk about

06:22:25.120 --> 06:22:29.760
how they're going to measure their own effectiveness as it relates to the work that

06:22:29.760 --> 06:22:36.240
they're doing in the state. The OPTAL is an observation protocol to help teachers

06:22:36.880 --> 06:22:43.920
assess academic language for English learners and we are still looking for teachers of all grade

06:22:43.920 --> 06:22:50.480
levels to help pilot that assessment, particularly Northern California and elementary teachers. So

06:22:50.480 --> 06:22:56.640
please put the word out. And then finally, the Advisory Commission on Special Education,

06:22:58.240 --> 06:23:04.640
if you have a pen, write this down. The El Dorado County Office and SELPA colleagues presented

06:23:04.640 --> 06:23:12.800
the system of improvement leads work and the URL is systemimprovement.org.

06:23:14.320 --> 06:23:20.160
So an LEA across the state can find their data and drill down to see the percentage of time

06:23:20.160 --> 06:23:26.160
students are spending in general education versus special education and also there's a data center

06:23:26.160 --> 06:23:31.120
that allows LEAs to desegregate information by multiple variables and compare performance to

06:23:31.120 --> 06:23:38.000
state indicators. So I would just encourage folks to visit that systemimprovement.org website and

06:23:38.000 --> 06:23:45.680
take a look there. And then finally, David Toffsten was selected as the vice chair of the AXE

06:23:46.400 --> 06:23:50.800
and as our own board member reporter demonstrates the power of youth leadership,

06:23:50.800 --> 06:23:55.840
the AXE is preparing to select two new student members to serve on its commission. Thank you.

06:23:55.840 --> 06:24:04.400
Thank you. And I'll just reinforce that the NASB conference that you've heard about from both

06:24:04.400 --> 06:24:10.480
Francisco and Aide is open to all of our board members. So you should be hearing from NASB about

06:24:10.480 --> 06:24:17.040
that and it will be in October in San Diego in our state. I hear from the NASB folks all the time

06:24:17.040 --> 06:24:21.760
how thrilled they are with the board members who are representing us in their various committees.

06:24:21.760 --> 06:24:28.160
So I think we can go and both learn and teach in that context. And with that,

06:24:28.160 --> 06:24:34.400
I'm going to adjourn our March 2023 state board meeting at 3.02 p.m.

06:24:35.360 --> 06:24:44.400
Thank you and I look forward to seeing you at our May meeting.
