WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.440
Welcome everyone to today's well-being learning community webinar.

00:13.440 --> 00:16.700
We're really excited to have you and really excited to learn

00:16.700 --> 00:19.120
from the conversation that's going to occur today.

00:19.700 --> 00:23.500
Before we get started, I just want to give some thank yous to all of our co-sponsors

00:23.500 --> 00:26.840
and partners to make this possible, including the Department of Commerce,

00:26.880 --> 00:30.440
the Federal Plan for Equitable Long-Term Recovery and Resilience,

00:30.800 --> 00:35.040
the National League of Cities, New America, the Justice, Health,

00:35.040 --> 00:39.640
and Democracy Impact Initiative at Harvard University, and the Well-Being Economy Alliance.

00:40.120 --> 00:42.820
We've got a great event lined up for you.

00:43.100 --> 00:45.840
We're going to start off hearing from the National League of Cities.

00:45.840 --> 00:50.280
We're going to talk about the different ways that cities are innovating new approaches

00:50.280 --> 00:51.560
to equitable well-being.

00:51.920 --> 00:56.080
We're going to hear from Green Bay, who have a really interesting approach involving

00:56.080 --> 01:00.460
private-public partnerships as a way to address systemic

01:00.460 --> 01:03.300
and structural barriers to health and well-being.

01:03.780 --> 01:06.840
We're going to have a discussion that will be led by Shannon Arvizu

01:06.840 --> 01:08.120
from the Department of Commerce.

01:08.120 --> 01:13.280
And then we'll hear from some other federal voices who are going to reflect and ask

01:13.280 --> 01:15.880
and help us kind of process and unpack what we've learned.

01:15.880 --> 01:18.340
And then we're going to close out with an audience Q&A.

01:18.340 --> 01:22.600
So please do make note of any questions that come up as we're going through today's session.

01:23.600 --> 01:29.020
This community comes out of last year's Census Bureau sprint on well-being measurement,

01:29.020 --> 01:33.640
as well as out of the Biden administration convening on advancing equity

01:33.640 --> 01:34.760
and well-being through data.

01:35.420 --> 01:38.480
We've previously looked a lot at specifically federal efforts,

01:38.480 --> 01:43.440
including at last month's webinar where we had a learning exchange with the Canadian government.

01:43.920 --> 01:47.640
This month, we're turning the lens instead focusing on local efforts,

01:47.640 --> 01:52.220
ways that cities have been leaders in the space of well-being or innovating new approaches.

01:52.600 --> 01:57.320
As well as looking at and thinking about how federal agencies can support the leadership

01:57.320 --> 02:02.120
of cities in a whole-of-government approach to well-being

02:02.120 --> 02:04.620
at the center of our approach to public policy.

02:05.100 --> 02:08.400
Before we hear from our guests, a word from a few of our co-sponsors.

02:08.740 --> 02:10.620
First, I'll turn over to Amanda Janauve.

02:12.160 --> 02:14.160
Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.

02:14.160 --> 02:16.380
I'm thrilled to be here with you all.

02:16.380 --> 02:17.100
So I'm Amanda.

02:17.100 --> 02:20.860
I'm the economics and policy lead at the Well-Being Economy Alliance,

02:20.860 --> 02:27.740
which is a global collaboration of organizations, academics, activists, and governments

02:27.740 --> 02:32.500
that are really committed to redefining progress away from GDP or economic growth

02:32.500 --> 02:35.420
towards centering social and ecological well-being.

02:36.220 --> 02:40.820
And within this movement, we've engaged in supporting many federal-level governments.

02:40.820 --> 02:45.700
But I think that a lot of the most exciting innovation we see, it happens at the city level

02:45.780 --> 02:52.280
and can be such a huge inspiration for expanding our imaginations around participatory processes,

02:52.280 --> 02:57.580
around more holistic whole-of-governance approaches, and really contextual strategies

02:57.580 --> 03:03.300
that meet the needs of both people and planet in terms of the policy design and implementation.

03:03.460 --> 03:05.060
So I'll hand it over to Elizabeth now.

03:05.060 --> 03:07.500
We're really looking forward to the discussions today.

03:08.580 --> 03:09.540
Welcome, everyone.

03:09.540 --> 03:10.620
I'm Elizabeth Garlo.

03:10.620 --> 03:12.360
I'm a fellow with New America.

03:12.600 --> 03:17.480
And part of the genesis of this learning community is recognizing that there's just been this

03:17.480 --> 03:25.080
tremendous groundswell of research and movement-led support to shift us toward well-being as a society.

03:25.080 --> 03:31.480
And yet, we sort of lack the spaces to, with great candor and vulnerability, share

03:31.480 --> 03:34.920
where we're getting stuck or where we're succeeding in implementation.

03:34.920 --> 03:40.120
And so what we wanted to do with this learning exchange, as we did last month with Canada,

03:40.120 --> 03:45.400
is just offer that space for us to dig a little bit beneath the surface, recognize

03:45.400 --> 03:50.360
that we share conviction of the need to shift our systems in the direction of well-being

03:50.360 --> 03:55.240
and really just sort of get underneath the surface and hear how things are working within

03:55.240 --> 04:02.120
a particular context and foster this kind of unusual cross-section dialogue between our

04:02.120 --> 04:04.360
federal stakeholders and local stakeholders.

04:04.360 --> 04:09.400
So I'm going to just turn us right into the sort of heart of our discussion by bringing

04:09.400 --> 04:14.040
in Sue Polis, who directs the Health and Well-being Portfolio for the National League of Cities.

04:14.040 --> 04:18.200
We are so thrilled that Sue was open to collaborating on today's discussion.

04:18.200 --> 04:24.120
Her work includes the design, development, and implementation of their Cities of Opportunity

04:24.120 --> 04:30.200
Initiative, which is this multi-year effort to engage mayors and city leaders in comprehensively

04:30.200 --> 04:34.040
addressing the social determinants of health through policy and systems change.

04:34.040 --> 04:38.040
So I'm going to turn it over to Sue to give a little bit of an overview of her work.

04:38.040 --> 04:41.320
And then she and her colleague, Gordes, will dive a little bit deeper with it.

04:41.320 --> 04:43.160
So Sue, I'll turn it over to you.

04:43.160 --> 04:44.040
Thanks, Elizabeth.

04:44.040 --> 04:45.880
And it's wonderful to be with you all today.

04:46.680 --> 04:50.680
Elizabeth talked about my current role at the University of the Health and Wellness

04:50.680 --> 04:52.600
Portfolio for the League of Cities.

04:52.600 --> 04:56.760
But really, prior to being at the National League of Cities, most of my work has been

04:57.320 --> 05:03.640
on federal health policy and a little bit of economic opportunity work from my AARPJs.

05:03.640 --> 05:09.560
So I really came to the National League of Cities with lots of questions around how

05:09.560 --> 05:17.800
we could inform federal policy, but also how cities would be implementing this work on

05:17.800 --> 05:18.360
the ground.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.560
So just to say that.

05:19.560 --> 05:25.400
And Elizabeth talked about the initiative that I've had the really humbling opportunity

05:25.400 --> 05:30.040
to lead here and design and develop cities of opportunity.

05:30.040 --> 05:35.960
And really, at its heart, when you kind of strip it all away, because policy and systems

05:35.960 --> 05:39.480
change to address social determinants of health is a mouthful.

05:39.480 --> 05:46.040
And it's really a matter of how do we support cities to bring them into this space?

05:46.040 --> 05:54.280
So we designed cities of opportunity with a few really key sentiments.

05:54.280 --> 05:55.720
Meet the cities where they are.

05:56.440 --> 06:00.440
I spent a lot of time in my former role at Trust for America's Health developing

06:03.080 --> 06:09.480
best practices, gold standards of different community-based models and interventions.

06:09.480 --> 06:16.600
And candidly, not every city has the same capacity or the same ability to do that work.

06:16.600 --> 06:20.760
And so really, meeting the cities where they are was sort of fundamental.

06:20.760 --> 06:22.680
And social determinants of health.

06:23.080 --> 06:29.560
Not mayors wouldn't say they would run on trying to address social determinants of health.

06:29.560 --> 06:36.120
So how could we really begin to bring them into this work and space with the idea that

06:36.120 --> 06:38.440
they do have a role to play in health?

06:38.440 --> 06:44.200
And so we started talking to mayors and city leaders early on in my tenure here.

06:44.200 --> 06:50.760
And really, they said there wasn't really one way or one key issue that they felt like they

06:51.720 --> 06:57.560
could make a big difference in health as it's really a range of factors that impact health,

06:57.560 --> 07:04.040
like access to housing or lack of access to housing, access to jobs or lack of access to jobs.

07:04.760 --> 07:10.600
And so they were speaking to social determinants, but in a different way.

07:11.400 --> 07:15.800
And since we knew people are not one-dimensional, they don't need one thing.

07:15.880 --> 07:21.080
They don't need just a good school or just a safe home or just food or just transportation.

07:21.960 --> 07:26.440
Our emphasis with cities of opportunity is really to help cities think about

07:27.240 --> 07:32.040
the holistic needs of their residents in their community and work across

07:32.040 --> 07:36.120
their city agencies, work more effectively in partnership.

07:36.760 --> 07:44.200
And the city leaders also told us very early on that regardless of political party,

07:44.440 --> 07:47.800
they felt like the zip code maps was a call to action.

07:47.800 --> 07:54.120
And how a Democrat or Republican mayor might lead on a call to action could be different.

07:54.840 --> 08:00.280
A Republican mayor that we spoke to said, for me, if I want my residents to work,

08:00.280 --> 08:03.000
it's my responsibility to make sure they can get to work.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.040
Transportation, more of the focus there versus other mayors that we talked to

08:09.000 --> 08:15.080
you know, that might be more akin to health care access, right?

08:15.080 --> 08:22.520
So very different, but all about reacting to those differences in what we call

08:22.520 --> 08:24.600
quality and length of life, right?

08:25.160 --> 08:27.320
Or social determinants of health, right?

08:27.320 --> 08:32.440
The differences, sometimes 10, 12, 18 years difference in life expectancy

08:33.320 --> 08:34.760
in neighboring zip codes.

08:34.760 --> 08:39.240
And so those zip code maps really were so foundational to this work.

08:39.800 --> 08:46.040
And so Elizabeth and Tony, as we were putting this together, asked me to just kind of share

08:46.040 --> 08:51.320
some examples that have emerged as we continue to build cities of opportunity.

08:51.320 --> 08:57.000
But also in our work over the last couple of years, we have been partnered with cities

08:57.000 --> 09:03.000
to understand how they're moving into well-being measures, right?

09:03.000 --> 09:07.320
How they're moving away from singular measures that have been used in the past,

09:07.320 --> 09:13.320
like worst domestic product or GDP to a broader range of factors.

09:13.320 --> 09:18.360
And we're seeing a lot of different ways the cities are coming to this work.

09:19.080 --> 09:24.200
And so I'll try, we'll try to illuminate them for you today as part of this discussion.

09:24.280 --> 09:29.480
But I think based on cities of opportunity and some of the examples I wanted to share

09:29.480 --> 09:34.360
to kind of speak to some of the barriers we see, especially as we think about the role

09:34.360 --> 09:38.120
of federal, state, and local partnerships, right?

09:38.120 --> 09:39.400
To work toward alignment.

09:40.120 --> 09:45.880
We've had some really wonderful work emerge through the cities of opportunity initiative.

09:45.880 --> 09:53.080
We say wonderful because we feel like the work the cities are doing are transformational.

09:53.080 --> 09:56.120
And I'll share a little bit about some of those with you.

09:56.120 --> 10:04.200
So Tacoma, Washington was part of our Mayor's Institute on Economic Opportunity and Health.

10:04.200 --> 10:09.560
And the real impetus for why is the health and wellness team

10:09.560 --> 10:13.720
at the National League of Cities leading a Mayor's Institute on Economic Opportunity?

10:13.720 --> 10:16.520
Because with the opioids epidemic, right?

10:16.520 --> 10:23.320
Many cities were trying to think about how do we bring true recovery to our communities,

10:23.320 --> 10:23.720
right?

10:23.720 --> 10:28.360
Through jobs, through purpose, through giving people hope and seeing that they have a role

10:28.360 --> 10:29.560
to play in their community.

10:29.560 --> 10:34.360
And so jobs became a big emphasis of our Mayor's Institute on Opioids.

10:34.360 --> 10:39.560
So we convened a Mayor's Institute on Economic Opportunity and Health with the recognition

10:39.560 --> 10:43.320
that for some folks, it's really hard for them to even get into the workforce, right?

10:43.320 --> 10:44.920
They might have a criminal record.

10:44.920 --> 10:49.080
They might have an opioid use disorder or a substance use disorder, a mental health

10:49.080 --> 10:53.160
condition, other factors, right?

10:53.160 --> 10:59.640
And so with Tacoma, Washington, they already had a pretty good level of readiness.

10:59.640 --> 11:03.640
They had their health equity index, and you'll hear a little bit more about that today,

11:04.360 --> 11:09.240
that we're pointing them to the need to address economic opportunity.

11:09.240 --> 11:13.480
They had an anchor institution partnership with their universities,

11:13.480 --> 11:17.480
with their city and county representation, with their health stakeholders,

11:17.480 --> 11:19.640
but it wasn't mobilized, right?

11:19.640 --> 11:25.000
And so by working with us, we embedded data partner in all of the work that we do so that

11:25.000 --> 11:29.800
the cities have that support because small and mid-sized cities in particular just lack

11:29.800 --> 11:32.520
that ongoing data capacity.

11:32.520 --> 11:37.560
And so what Tacoma really asked for was like, okay, we want a livable wage, we want livable

11:37.560 --> 11:38.120
wage jobs.

11:38.120 --> 11:40.280
What is a livable wage in Tacoma?

11:40.280 --> 11:42.280
And we helped them do that analysis.

11:42.280 --> 11:45.880
And the short story is it's $24 an hour, right?

11:45.880 --> 11:54.600
And then the follow-on was now what sectors have jobs that can support $24 an hour wage,

11:54.600 --> 11:55.160
right?

11:55.160 --> 11:59.240
And it was the healthcare sector because of all of the job loss through COVID.

11:59.240 --> 12:07.640
And so through that, a better understanding of what the opportunities and gaps were, they

12:07.640 --> 12:12.040
really coalesced this anchor institution partnership around what they call the earn

12:12.040 --> 12:13.320
and learn model.

12:13.320 --> 12:18.600
And so what that is, is they're bringing people into workforce training, but they did

12:18.600 --> 12:23.000
something really smart because we have a pretty big emphasis on civic engagement community

12:23.000 --> 12:23.960
co-design.

12:23.960 --> 12:28.120
They asked the community, what do you need to be successful in this program?

12:28.120 --> 12:30.600
And lo and behold, it wasn't just the training, right?

12:30.600 --> 12:33.640
But people have bills and other responsibilities.

12:33.640 --> 12:38.680
And so what they were able to do was leverage the Tacoma Housing Authority, their county

12:38.680 --> 12:46.040
workforce, WIOA dollars, the city's ARPA dollars, and these university partners to support the

12:46.040 --> 12:51.240
job training and the healthcare sector to ensure that the jobs would be there should

12:51.240 --> 12:54.040
they get people through the workforce training.

12:54.040 --> 13:01.480
And so now that has spurred a more intentional focus, something that they can build on.

13:02.200 --> 13:06.680
They're trying to build new cohorts of that earn and learn model to serve a greater number

13:06.680 --> 13:07.320
of people.

13:07.320 --> 13:11.960
They started in the Salishan community, and now they're thinking about what else can we

13:11.960 --> 13:19.320
do to build more support for economic opportunity and addressing the racial wealth gap.

13:19.320 --> 13:22.280
And so now they're really thinking about early childhood.

13:22.280 --> 13:25.960
So you would say, well, that sounds reasonable, right?

13:25.960 --> 13:30.040
But even though they had that partnership, the data was so fundamental.

13:30.040 --> 13:37.000
And while you can have great sources of data, there's still more analysis and specifics

13:37.000 --> 13:39.880
they need to really move through the policy, right?

13:39.880 --> 13:44.280
And so I think Elizabeth and Tony wanted me to speak to some of the barriers.

13:44.280 --> 13:49.400
Like Tacoma, everyone's trying to figure this out in every city across the country, right?

13:49.400 --> 13:56.120
And so the reliance on federal funding streams for cities can be pretty high.

13:57.080 --> 14:00.040
I talked about Tacoma bringing forth ARPA.

14:00.040 --> 14:04.840
That's unprecedented that they would have that kind of flexibility to have skin in the

14:04.840 --> 14:08.280
game to produce a pilot like this, right?

14:08.280 --> 14:14.440
And so when we say more flexibility for cities, because often they're hampered, right?

14:14.440 --> 14:19.400
Categorical funding streams from the different federal agencies often come with constraints

14:19.400 --> 14:22.680
about how they have to be used and for whom and to what end.

14:22.680 --> 14:25.320
And those differences in definitions, right?

14:25.320 --> 14:30.840
Let's just take homelessness between the Department of Education, HHS, and HUD are

14:30.840 --> 14:32.200
all quite different.

14:32.200 --> 14:37.960
Even a city like Las Vegas that's implementing programs for AIDS patients, right?

14:37.960 --> 14:43.560
Ryan White dollars and housing for people with AIDS dollars do not have matching definitions.

14:43.560 --> 14:48.280
They have different criteria and it's very hard for them to even serve the same population

14:48.280 --> 14:50.680
which those programs are intended to do.

14:50.680 --> 14:52.600
So all of this trickles down, right?

14:52.920 --> 14:57.160
Everything trickles down and so the burden is on alignment at the local level.

14:57.160 --> 15:01.320
But then, right, people have to pull their heads up and say, is there a different way

15:01.320 --> 15:02.920
to do this, right?

15:02.920 --> 15:08.120
And so that's what we're really trying to help them do is set a table and move through

15:08.120 --> 15:10.280
the work in a different way.

15:10.280 --> 15:15.320
And I can provide additional examples, but I want to be cognizant of time.

15:15.320 --> 15:16.120
Thanks, Sue.

15:16.120 --> 15:17.480
Let's pause there real quickly.

15:17.480 --> 15:21.960
I want to bring in Lourdes Aceves, who's the program director and the co-founder of

15:22.280 --> 15:23.480
and a colleague of yours.

15:24.280 --> 15:29.240
I think the two of you, it would be helpful to just hear a little bit about maybe just

15:29.240 --> 15:32.680
double-click a little bit on well-being data and measurement and the way city and federal

15:32.680 --> 15:38.440
stakeholders are working together in the Cities of Opportunity Initiative and otherwise.

15:38.440 --> 15:43.000
And unfortunately, Chelsea Talbert from Tacoma, Washington isn't able to join us today to

15:43.000 --> 15:45.240
do a kind of deeper dive on their equity index.

15:45.240 --> 15:48.920
And so Lourdes, I want to invite you in to speak a little bit about those efforts.

15:48.920 --> 15:52.440
Sure, I'm happy.

15:52.440 --> 15:53.080
Can you hear me?

15:54.360 --> 15:55.080
Yes, we can.

15:55.960 --> 15:56.760
Great.

15:56.760 --> 16:01.960
Yes, I'm happy to speak on behalf of Chelsea Talbert of Tacoma.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.320
I hope she doesn't mind.

16:04.120 --> 16:11.720
We've spent a lot of time thinking about the work in Tacoma as it relates to the Cities

16:11.720 --> 16:13.880
of Opportunity and beyond.

16:13.880 --> 16:18.120
But Tacoma was able to create an equity index.

16:18.600 --> 16:26.200
And they created it based on feedback from the community who wanted Tacoma to be an equitable

16:26.200 --> 16:28.440
and inclusive place.

16:29.160 --> 16:36.440
And it came about in 2015 as part of the city's 10-year strategic plan, which now includes

16:36.440 --> 16:38.760
an equity and empowerment framework.

16:39.960 --> 16:43.800
And the challenge was that although the city adopted it,

16:44.760 --> 16:51.000
city staff was challenged by how to lead with equity when performing tasks such as

16:51.000 --> 16:52.760
installing streetlights.

16:52.760 --> 16:56.680
They wanted to do it, but they were like, we're not exactly sure how that works.

16:57.480 --> 17:04.680
So what the City of Tacoma did was in 2018, they worked with Ohio State's Kerwin Institute

17:05.640 --> 17:13.320
to develop an opportunity index that evaluated census blocks based on 32

17:13.320 --> 17:22.040
indicators in five categories to determine each census block or tracts, access to housing,

17:22.040 --> 17:29.000
health care, and other amenities, as well as to determine low opportunity areas and

17:29.000 --> 17:34.760
which communities were disproportionately impacted by the lack of access to these things.

17:36.200 --> 17:42.200
Unsurprisingly, perhaps these were communities that were people of color, that were non-English

17:42.200 --> 17:49.160
speakers, and so they created this opportunity index to give them that broad look at their

17:49.160 --> 17:56.440
city, as well as to help them inform community engagement strategies and support the diverse

17:56.440 --> 17:57.960
communities of Tacoma.

17:58.520 --> 18:03.240
And as they shared with us, the purpose of these tools was threefold.

18:03.240 --> 18:05.160
Is that a word, twofold, threefold?

18:05.160 --> 18:06.520
We'll go with that today.

18:07.320 --> 18:13.880
To identify and track disparities, to support data-driven decision-making,

18:14.760 --> 18:18.440
and to increase transparency and accountability.

18:19.480 --> 18:27.640
So what they, again, these are all wonderful reasons and goals, but they kept being challenged.

18:27.640 --> 18:32.920
Well, how is city staff supposed to use these equity tools and indices?

18:33.560 --> 18:38.920
So going back to the streetlights example, Tacoma only had a limited number of funds,

18:38.920 --> 18:40.200
most cities, right?

18:40.200 --> 18:41.720
That's the case everywhere.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.640
So they had to prioritize.

18:43.640 --> 18:50.200
And so to do this, they first assigned a safety score for each census tract, since safety's

18:50.200 --> 18:56.680
key when it comes to public works, and then they applied the equity index score, which

18:56.680 --> 19:02.520
resulted in some of the focus shifting to areas of lower opportunity.

19:03.320 --> 19:09.160
The city of Tacoma also used these equity tools to distribute loans and grants for

19:09.160 --> 19:16.840
small businesses, which I just love this story because they wanted to be fair, but they also

19:16.840 --> 19:21.720
wanted to make sure they were investing in areas that historically had been under-invested

19:21.720 --> 19:21.960
in.

19:22.840 --> 19:31.240
So in 2021, 2022, they used a lottery system where everyone who applied received a lottery

19:31.240 --> 19:37.960
entry, but businesses that were in lower opportunity areas received additional lottery

19:37.960 --> 19:41.720
entries to increase their chances of securing a loan.

19:42.680 --> 19:50.120
And the result was that 56% of the loans distributed in Tacoma during that period went

19:50.120 --> 19:56.840
to BIPOC small businesses, and that was not the case in prior years.

19:56.840 --> 20:04.840
So to me, this is a favorite example of how cities can measure and operationalize equity

20:04.840 --> 20:08.280
using tools such as Tacoma's equity index.

20:08.840 --> 20:14.920
So I just wanted to pause there because I was just providing a snippet on behalf of

20:14.920 --> 20:18.440
Chelsea, and I want to give everyone else an opportunity to go.

20:18.440 --> 20:25.640
Yeah, and I think just to take it a little bit into context about how cities are doing

20:25.640 --> 20:26.200
this.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.880
We would say it's still early.

20:27.880 --> 20:28.920
It's still nascent.

20:28.920 --> 20:35.240
It's more an outlier than the norm that cities are pursuing these types of efforts, and they're

20:35.240 --> 20:43.960
all kind of similar and different, different as like Louisville uses a survey to collect

20:43.960 --> 20:45.080
their information.

20:45.080 --> 20:49.560
And I think you'll hear a little bit from Natalie and Joe today about how well it was

20:49.560 --> 20:54.600
doing it through a survey-based approach versus Tacoma that's using more publicly

20:54.600 --> 20:57.640
accessible data, GIS mapping, right?

20:57.640 --> 21:04.440
So there's differences in how they're collecting it, differences in subjective, right, versus

21:04.440 --> 21:10.120
objective, Tacoma's being more objective, getting a little bit more subjective through

21:10.120 --> 21:16.840
the surveys, right, that Wello and Green Bay and Louisville might be doing.

21:16.840 --> 21:22.200
So there are differences, and there's quite a big difference in how it's talked about,

21:22.520 --> 21:26.840
like you'll hear Tacoma's equity index.

21:26.840 --> 21:30.760
In Santa Monica, it was the well-being index, right?

21:30.760 --> 21:38.040
They're all using slightly different terminology, but the result and the mechanisms are often

21:38.680 --> 21:39.640
similar, right?

21:40.600 --> 21:46.520
And so just wanted to kind of say there is some real differences in how these things look

21:46.600 --> 21:52.200
and how they're coming to fruition and how different they are, right, in terms of how

21:52.200 --> 21:54.280
they're guided by different data sets, right?

21:54.280 --> 21:55.480
They're not uniform.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.640
Thank you so much, Sue and Lourdes.

21:59.640 --> 22:03.720
I think we'll pull you back in during our discussion where we dig a little deeper on

22:03.720 --> 22:07.160
kind of federal-local collaboration, but that was such a helpful illustration of what you're

22:07.160 --> 22:09.080
doing across the country in different places.

22:09.960 --> 22:13.960
I'd like to turn it over to our friends from Green Bay, Wisconsin.

22:13.960 --> 22:18.200
We have Joe Faulds, who's the Chief of Operations for the City of Green Bay,

22:19.240 --> 22:23.400
and then we have Natalie Baumstad, who serves as the Executive Director of Wello, which is a

22:23.400 --> 22:28.040
Green Bay-based nonprofit that's focused on advancing health and well-being for all.

22:28.040 --> 22:32.840
So you have this kind of unique partnership here within Green Bay, both inside government

22:32.840 --> 22:35.800
and outside in a nonprofit, and they'll share a little bit about the work that they've been

22:35.800 --> 22:36.040
doing.

22:36.040 --> 22:37.000
Thank you both so much.

22:38.040 --> 22:41.880
Thank you so much for having us, and I'm going to go ahead and share my screen if that's okay

22:41.880 --> 22:42.920
with everyone.

22:42.920 --> 22:46.440
Can I just get a thumbs up, Elizabeth, that you're seeing that?

22:46.440 --> 22:47.880
All right, wonderful.

22:47.880 --> 22:49.640
Well, thank you so much for having us today.

22:49.640 --> 22:51.960
We're really excited to be with you.

22:52.600 --> 22:57.000
I wanted just to start off by saying, you know, we have a few minutes here with you today to kind

22:57.000 --> 23:02.440
of share a little bit more about our approach here in Green Bay, but recognize that any one

23:02.440 --> 23:07.800
of these slides, we could probably have a whole hour conversation or more with you all on.

23:07.880 --> 23:13.080
So I would encourage you, if you do have questions, feel free to ask those at the end

23:13.080 --> 23:18.360
of this presentation, and or feel free to, you know, reach out via email or a phone call.

23:18.360 --> 23:21.880
We'd be happy to answer those questions for you and continue the conversation.

23:22.440 --> 23:25.640
So again, my name is Natalie Baumstead, and I'll kick it over to Joe just to introduce

23:25.640 --> 23:26.520
himself as well.

23:27.720 --> 23:28.520
Yeah, I'm Joe Falls.

23:28.520 --> 23:30.440
I'm the Chief Operations at the City of Green Bay.

23:30.440 --> 23:34.440
So just like Natalie said, thank you so much for having us and letting us share a story with you.

23:36.120 --> 23:36.520
Wonderful.

23:37.400 --> 23:40.200
So Wello, what is Wello?

23:40.200 --> 23:44.760
Wello is a nonprofit organization, and it's located in the City of Green Bay.

23:44.760 --> 23:50.440
We were established in 2020 and have kind of an interesting kind of founding story.

23:51.080 --> 23:56.360
Our local paper actually released an editorial asking people to think bold about what we could

23:56.360 --> 24:00.360
do as a community to ensure a healthy, thriving future.

24:00.360 --> 24:05.560
And the number one thing that readers submitted was around this idea of how do we invest in our

24:05.560 --> 24:06.920
community's health?

24:06.920 --> 24:11.800
And so much so that the paper actually brought then together a number of different partners,

24:12.440 --> 24:18.840
partners from government, health care, business, educations, nonprofit, residents, and really

24:18.840 --> 24:23.720
came together to think about what do we do with that kind of that community charge?

24:23.720 --> 24:28.440
And the result of that was the formation of our organization, really recognizing kind of

24:28.440 --> 24:33.240
meeting this backbone organization to really help create and kind of foster that bold and

24:33.240 --> 24:38.040
shared vision around what does it mean to have a community well-being approach?

24:38.040 --> 24:42.920
And our mission is really to co-create those community conditions that are fair and just

24:42.920 --> 24:45.240
to drive high levels of health and well-being for all.

24:45.960 --> 24:50.440
And we really recognize that one of the main issues that we have here locally is around

24:50.440 --> 24:54.360
that that health and well-being inequities are really driving poor health outcomes for

24:54.360 --> 24:58.440
people living in Brown County, Wisconsin, which is the county that Green Bay sits within

24:58.440 --> 25:00.680
and really Northeast Wisconsin at large.

25:00.680 --> 25:05.160
And that we know that for good health and well-being, we know that that's really a

25:05.160 --> 25:09.560
fundamental ingredient for people, places, and economies to thrive.

25:09.560 --> 25:14.920
And so Wello really is a part of this conversation by really addressing the systemic and the

25:14.920 --> 25:18.760
structural barriers that are really limiting health and well-being.

25:18.760 --> 25:24.840
And we use a kind of a grassroots almost equitable community building approach to achieve that.

25:25.800 --> 25:29.880
So we started initially right in 2010.

25:29.880 --> 25:33.800
We really started with this with this fairly large CDC grant.

25:33.800 --> 25:38.760
So some of that public funding that really helped move and mobilize us.

25:38.760 --> 25:41.640
But it was really focused on physical health.

25:41.640 --> 25:46.120
And very quickly we learned that in order to really achieve our mission, we really needed

25:46.120 --> 25:50.680
to think more broadly about what are all of those building blocks to really focus not

25:50.680 --> 25:54.520
only on physical health, but more holistically on well-being.

25:54.600 --> 26:01.720
And so through that process in 2015 and building into 2017, we really engaged on a strategic

26:01.720 --> 26:07.000
planning process with our community that really started to to further spark this movement

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
and really be thinking about well-being.

26:09.000 --> 26:13.080
And one of the things that we found is when we were focused on kind of that physical health

26:13.080 --> 26:17.080
and obesity as part of that physical health conversation, we felt that many people

26:18.200 --> 26:20.600
didn't really see themselves in that space.

26:21.320 --> 26:24.840
It may have been not it's not very inclusive space.

26:24.840 --> 26:29.320
And when we shifted the language around to one of well-being, we found more people

26:29.960 --> 26:32.360
saw themselves in that that vision.

26:32.360 --> 26:35.640
They saw themselves as part of the solution as well.

26:35.640 --> 26:39.240
It might be that I'm struggling with my physical health, but maybe I have something really

26:39.240 --> 26:44.440
great to give in terms of mental health or social connection or those environment pieces.

26:44.440 --> 26:49.240
So broadening the definition to well-being really called more people in and allowed us,

26:49.240 --> 26:51.640
we believe, to really spark a bigger movement.

26:52.360 --> 26:56.040
When we looked at what do we need to sustain something like this?

26:56.040 --> 27:00.760
One of the things that Sue mentioned is in Green Bay, we use a public-private partnership

27:00.760 --> 27:02.280
in terms of financing this.

27:02.280 --> 27:03.960
So what does that mean?

27:03.960 --> 27:06.840
That means that we're not embedded within government.

27:06.840 --> 27:13.080
We actually you heard me say that a CDC grant really helps spark the initial well movement.

27:13.080 --> 27:18.840
So we do receive and we continue right for some of those public granting opportunities.

27:18.920 --> 27:23.640
But then we braid that funding in with local, with state and other federal opportunities.

27:23.640 --> 27:29.080
And in particular, given that we are founded with also in partnership with our health care

27:29.080 --> 27:33.400
community, as well as our business partnerships, we also look at braiding in that funding to

27:33.400 --> 27:34.680
really sustain these efforts.

27:35.240 --> 27:39.640
And one of the things that we saw very concretely was the importance of having a backbone

27:39.640 --> 27:43.640
organization to really continue to move this vision forward.

27:43.640 --> 27:47.960
So because we are not embedded within a governmental unit, having that backbone that

27:47.960 --> 27:53.000
can continue to really help cast that bold vision and then continue to really catalyze

27:53.000 --> 27:56.680
some of the action around the actual work was really important.

27:56.680 --> 28:01.480
And so as we continued our strategic planning process, we really wanted to be intentional

28:01.480 --> 28:05.640
about thinking about how do we continue to support those operations and that core mission,

28:05.640 --> 28:10.600
as well as really focusing in on that implementation science piece of the work.

28:11.400 --> 28:14.040
So through that process, a number of things happened.

28:14.120 --> 28:18.920
And one of the core things that happened was really this idea of defining what matters

28:18.920 --> 28:23.880
to us and using local data to really think about what well-being looks like currently

28:23.880 --> 28:26.520
and how it might change over time.

28:26.520 --> 28:31.400
And so as we looked across the nation and across really the world at this time, so back

28:31.400 --> 28:36.280
in kind of a 2017 timeframe, we were really looking at how do you define this?

28:36.920 --> 28:38.040
What are those measures?

28:38.680 --> 28:43.080
And really looking at what potential tools might be adapted to our local context.

28:43.080 --> 28:47.160
And really the well-being equation that we prescribed to here in Green Bay is kind of

28:47.160 --> 28:48.360
a two part.

28:48.360 --> 28:53.480
One, it is really looking at how well-being is really a combination between personal

28:53.480 --> 28:58.840
perspectives or their subjective measures, as well as those community conditions or those

28:58.840 --> 29:00.360
objective data measures.

29:01.000 --> 29:07.480
In Green Bay, we had relatively good local objective data, but we were in a data gap.

29:07.480 --> 29:12.840
We were in a data desert when it came to those local subjective measures of well-being.

29:12.840 --> 29:17.240
And so that's really where Wello focused to really work with a group to define what that

29:17.240 --> 29:22.440
looked like, because we knew that that type of data would really help create the spaces

29:22.440 --> 29:25.320
and really those conversations around which we could act.

29:25.320 --> 29:31.240
And so as we fast forward through this strategic planning process, in 2019, we released our

29:31.240 --> 29:34.520
first survey, and I'll go a little bit more in depth on what that looks like in a few

29:34.520 --> 29:35.320
slides.

29:35.320 --> 29:37.160
And then we really started getting to work.

29:37.160 --> 29:41.560
So the data is all about how are we driving community-led projects, really focused on

29:41.560 --> 29:46.760
bringing both those formal and informal leaders together and really also focusing intentionally

29:46.760 --> 29:51.480
on the communications and storytelling and thinking about our audience as really the

29:51.480 --> 29:52.440
community, right?

29:52.440 --> 29:57.240
And how do we take what can sometimes be academic language and really focus on the community

29:57.240 --> 29:58.680
facing language for that?

29:59.240 --> 30:04.440
The other thing that happened here was on October 3rd, that is our official day of health

30:04.440 --> 30:06.200
and well-being across our region.

30:06.280 --> 30:12.280
So we had mayors of our two largest municipalities, so Green Bay and De Pere, as well as our Brown

30:12.280 --> 30:16.760
County supervisor, all sign a declaration recognizing the importance of health and

30:16.760 --> 30:21.720
well-being for our communities and for the future of our communities as well.

30:23.000 --> 30:28.840
So at Wello, our model is kind of these, boils down to these seven key components.

30:28.840 --> 30:33.560
So as we think about addressing structural and systemic barriers, often we get asked,

30:33.560 --> 30:35.320
well, how do you do that, right?

30:35.320 --> 30:39.800
And we like that question because at Wello, we really focus more on the how than in the

30:39.800 --> 30:40.680
what, right?

30:40.680 --> 30:43.800
We feel like that's really where that secret sauce lies.

30:43.800 --> 30:47.160
And kind of the first thing that we think about is starting small.

30:47.800 --> 30:49.640
You all live in this well-being world.

30:49.640 --> 30:55.320
If you talk to someone about advancing equitable well-being, sometimes you get this kind of

30:55.320 --> 30:58.120
this stare back at you, this blank look.

30:58.120 --> 31:00.360
It seems so large, right?

31:00.360 --> 31:04.600
And so when we think about how are we bringing people together and how are we

31:04.680 --> 31:09.880
catalyzing action, we really understood very quickly that we need to start small.

31:09.880 --> 31:14.200
We need to bring people along and we need to build those building blocks.

31:14.200 --> 31:19.160
And so I often use the analogy of when you ask someone to engage with you on advancing

31:19.160 --> 31:23.400
equitable well-being, it's like asking someone to come with you, just the two of you, and

31:23.400 --> 31:25.480
try to boil the world's oceans, right?

31:25.480 --> 31:29.240
It seems so unattainable and something like, oh my gosh, that seems so big.

31:29.240 --> 31:31.160
How are we going to get our arms around that?

31:31.240 --> 31:35.560
But instead, what if we said we have a glass of water right here, right?

31:35.560 --> 31:39.400
We know some things about chemistry and biology and these different sciences.

31:39.400 --> 31:43.800
How can we figure out how to boil this cup of water, right?

31:43.800 --> 31:48.040
And what happens when we break it down into small incremental parts is that we're

31:48.040 --> 31:50.040
developing a relationship with one another.

31:50.040 --> 31:51.480
We're developing trust.

31:51.480 --> 31:53.640
We're testing some things, right?

31:53.640 --> 31:59.240
And as we're successful doing the small thing, we can then look at, okay, what's that next

31:59.240 --> 31:59.880
step, right?

31:59.880 --> 32:00.920
And what is that next step?

32:00.920 --> 32:03.800
And that's really how you build sustained systems change over time.

32:04.440 --> 32:08.280
So that is really kind of the heart of the work that we do here at Wellow.

32:08.280 --> 32:11.720
We're always also identifying what is that win-win, right?

32:11.720 --> 32:14.360
Why would someone want to do this with you?

32:14.360 --> 32:17.960
And we're big believers, and you need to have a little bit of that win-win.

32:17.960 --> 32:25.640
And that win-win may be because we can bring in some resources to help support you, and

32:25.640 --> 32:29.880
that also supports the greater good, but you have to identify that win-win.

32:29.880 --> 32:35.320
We also value and center live experience, as well as always leading with this entrepreneurial

32:35.320 --> 32:37.960
spirit and really the spirit of innovation.

32:37.960 --> 32:42.120
It kind of goes back to our founding around thinking boldly, right?

32:42.120 --> 32:44.680
What is something that maybe we've tried and tried and tried again?

32:44.680 --> 32:49.240
How can we think about that problem a little bit differently and try something new?

32:49.240 --> 32:51.720
And at the heart of that, it's always learn by doing, right?

32:51.720 --> 32:56.760
It's taking action and really resourcing that action so that we can build that local

32:56.760 --> 33:00.440
capacity so that we can have the sustained impacts that we're looking to achieve.

33:01.800 --> 33:05.960
So in terms of just some core pieces, one of those core pieces of how we do that work

33:05.960 --> 33:06.920
is around measure.

33:07.560 --> 33:13.880
So Wellow's measurement work, as I mentioned before, is really around a three-pronged approach.

33:13.880 --> 33:19.960
So we recognize that there's inherent bias in just one of these approaches alone, so

33:19.960 --> 33:22.440
we really bring in three approaches together.

33:22.440 --> 33:24.040
One is that biannual survey.

33:24.600 --> 33:27.000
So we do that on the odd years.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.440
So we are coming upon a survey collection period here in July.

33:31.240 --> 33:33.560
And then we also pair that with a panel study.

33:33.560 --> 33:35.080
So that's a longitudinal panel.

33:35.080 --> 33:39.320
It's about 600 people across our county, and it's really focused on the social

33:39.320 --> 33:40.200
determinants of health.

33:40.200 --> 33:44.120
And we actually use that vital conditions framework to really think about how things

33:44.120 --> 33:45.400
change over time.

33:45.400 --> 33:50.680
This was particularly helpful for some of our efforts as we thought about the pandemic.

33:51.160 --> 33:53.880
So the pandemic hit, right?

33:53.880 --> 33:58.840
And we had this panel, and we were able to ask similar questions about behavioral change

33:58.840 --> 34:04.280
regarding how people felt in terms of safety, in terms of masking, different concepts like

34:04.280 --> 34:04.840
that.

34:04.840 --> 34:08.520
But we were also able to look at impacts to well-being.

34:08.520 --> 34:12.840
And one of the things that we saw was while depression and isolation, those feelings of

34:12.840 --> 34:17.800
loneliness increased, they increased at a greater rate for actually women than men in

34:17.800 --> 34:18.360
our community.

34:18.440 --> 34:22.360
So we're actually able to then think about, OK, what does that mean in terms of how we're

34:22.360 --> 34:24.920
allocating resources for equitable recovery?

34:25.640 --> 34:28.360
And the third prong of our approach is around ground truthing.

34:28.360 --> 34:33.880
So really making sure that these first two approaches are point in time pieces.

34:33.880 --> 34:37.880
And so how do we then also bring in some of that lived and learned experience through

34:37.880 --> 34:41.800
our measurement team, as well as through community-led change projects?

34:43.720 --> 34:48.280
And then in terms of activating that data, we also really are interested in how we

34:48.360 --> 34:52.440
can kind of bring it into the digital realm and really think about and activate the power

34:52.440 --> 34:53.320
of place.

34:53.320 --> 34:56.920
So all of our data is collected currently by zip code.

34:56.920 --> 35:01.640
And this next iteration of our survey will actually collect all the information by census

35:01.640 --> 35:01.960
track.

35:01.960 --> 35:08.760
And that is in a direct response to a lot of the federal and state-level data that is

35:08.760 --> 35:09.560
by census track.

35:09.560 --> 35:14.200
So we're trying to try to pair those pieces a little bit more intentionally together.

35:14.600 --> 35:20.200
And then the second or third prong of our work is really around mobilizing and innovating.

35:20.200 --> 35:23.960
And I think that's what makes our model a little bit unique, is that not only are we

35:24.520 --> 35:30.200
measuring and holding that space to measure our progress over time, we're also able then

35:30.200 --> 35:36.440
to really bring that into the advocacy efforts around how we really mobilize that data and

35:36.440 --> 35:41.720
catalyze that data for change, and really bring it into innovative community-led projects

35:42.440 --> 35:48.600
that can help really break it down and really focus the action to the small incremental

35:48.600 --> 35:49.000
pieces.

35:50.600 --> 35:52.040
So what have we learned?

35:52.040 --> 35:52.760
What have we learned?

35:52.760 --> 35:58.440
We have learned that system change, right, it really requires space for healing, trust,

35:58.440 --> 35:59.640
and relationship building.

36:00.280 --> 36:06.440
We think it is so important to focus more on the how and not necessarily the what, right?

36:06.440 --> 36:11.560
And I think we often, especially in this kind of butt heads a little bit with how funding

36:11.560 --> 36:17.480
usually is directed, which focuses on a category or a what, we really feel like in order for this

36:17.480 --> 36:22.040
work to truly work long term, we need to focus more on the how and how we're building that

36:22.040 --> 36:22.680
capacity.

36:23.400 --> 36:28.440
The second piece of things that we've really learned is that the ability to have local and

36:28.440 --> 36:34.440
equitable data ecosystems really matter, especially for a city like Green Bay where we're a mid-sized

36:34.440 --> 36:35.000
community.

36:35.880 --> 36:40.920
I think Sue mentioned this prior that we don't have necessarily a ton of operational

36:41.000 --> 36:47.160
capacity to do this, but how important it is to have that local data because if we're

36:47.160 --> 36:50.760
trying, if we're talking about systems change and trying to really disrupt these systems

36:50.760 --> 36:54.760
and make them more equitable and justice oriented, we need data that's not lagging.

36:55.560 --> 37:00.600
And, you know, Green Bay is the third largest municipality in Wisconsin, yet a lot of our

37:00.600 --> 37:03.160
data that we have are lagging indicators.

37:04.120 --> 37:07.560
And so it's really important that we do that.

37:07.560 --> 37:11.720
And it allows us for us to have some of those challenging conversations that is rooted in

37:11.720 --> 37:12.440
local data.

37:13.480 --> 37:15.800
The third is really need investment in the core mission.

37:16.680 --> 37:22.520
Again, because this really focuses on the how and not the what, focusing on that backbone

37:22.520 --> 37:27.720
role is really important, especially as we think about unrestricted multi-year dollars

37:27.720 --> 37:32.040
to really support the relationship building work that is required.

37:32.760 --> 37:36.440
And we truly believe that starting small and aiming for those win-wins

37:37.560 --> 37:38.680
really can't overstate that.

37:38.680 --> 37:41.160
We always say like, think big, but start small.

37:41.160 --> 37:44.600
And it really helps drive the proof of concept and bring more people to the table.

37:45.240 --> 37:50.600
And with that, I know Joe has a specific example that he wanted to bring forward from a city

37:50.600 --> 37:55.000
perspective on how we're kind of using data as well as mobilizing and activating people

37:55.000 --> 37:56.440
for some change.

37:57.560 --> 38:01.800
Yeah, I have an example of a real small win for Wello that I think went a long way in

38:01.800 --> 38:03.640
building relationships with municipalities.

38:03.640 --> 38:08.600
So in our area, we have a recreational trail that runs through several municipalities.

38:09.240 --> 38:10.520
We also live in Green Bay.

38:10.520 --> 38:14.280
We have something called ice and snow, which some of you I'm sure are familiar with.

38:15.160 --> 38:21.880
So during the winter and sadly the spring months, sometimes the trail would not be

38:22.840 --> 38:27.240
cleared off during all those areas where the municipalities, they own the trail.

38:28.040 --> 38:31.160
So what happened was a neutral third party Wello really kind of brought those

38:31.160 --> 38:35.080
municipalities together and said, what can we do to address this need so all of our

38:35.080 --> 38:40.040
members of the public can use the trail throughout the whole year and during those winter months?

38:40.040 --> 38:44.200
So they actually came up with an agreement together to share resources and ensure that

38:44.200 --> 38:47.160
the trail would be cleared off throughout the whole year.

38:47.160 --> 38:53.240
So it's a small win, but what Natalie has been saying is for Wello, it really built

38:53.240 --> 38:55.880
some strong rapport with the municipalities.

38:55.880 --> 38:59.800
And now municipalities can really look at Wello and say, we can rely on Wello to be a

38:59.800 --> 39:03.560
trusted partner and really improving the health and wellbeing for our residents that we serve.

39:03.560 --> 39:07.160
So really it's a small project, but it has gone a really long way for us.

39:08.680 --> 39:09.320
Thank you, Joe.

39:10.760 --> 39:15.720
I think at the end of the day, one of the biggest lessons is don't let perfection get in the way of

39:15.720 --> 39:22.680
progress. And I've been fortunate enough to do this work in community for over a decade now.

39:22.680 --> 39:26.280
And you often see, well, what's the measure?

39:26.280 --> 39:27.080
What's the thing?

39:27.080 --> 39:28.840
And have we thought of all of the things?

39:29.800 --> 39:35.960
And I think that you're definitely a big believer in, you know, leading with intention and with

39:35.960 --> 39:41.640
your values and making sure that those principles of equity and justice are central and that

39:41.640 --> 39:43.480
community is central to the work.

39:43.480 --> 39:47.480
And at the same time, recognizing that you're not going to have all the answers.

39:47.480 --> 39:50.120
And so if we don't start, we don't start, right?

39:50.920 --> 39:55.080
The only, you know, no progress is no progress.

39:55.080 --> 39:59.720
And so I think we have really learned that in a beautiful way that our community has

40:00.360 --> 40:01.320
come alongside us.

40:01.320 --> 40:05.720
And we've been very vulnerable in the sense of here's the first iteration of our survey,

40:06.280 --> 40:09.160
right? And we heard a lot of things like, well, why didn't you ask this?

40:09.800 --> 40:10.840
Have you thought of this, right?

40:10.840 --> 40:16.600
And then building that feedback back into the next iterations and working with community in

40:16.600 --> 40:18.200
a really iterative way.

40:18.200 --> 40:22.840
And I think in terms of how to build community well-being and resilience,

40:23.400 --> 40:27.640
I feel very strongly that that iterative approach is going to be much more successful than

40:28.360 --> 40:31.960
really having a top-down approach or, you know, trying to get to that perfect measure

40:31.960 --> 40:37.160
because perfection is constantly one of those moving, moving stars among us.

40:37.160 --> 40:42.200
So last kind of bit of information, when we think about sustaining the movement,

40:43.240 --> 40:46.120
we worked in a very purple region, right?

40:46.120 --> 40:52.360
And so one, you know, there's pros and cons of this public-private model that we have.

40:52.360 --> 40:57.240
One of the pros that we think it brings is that we can, and we've kind of shown that

40:57.240 --> 41:01.560
we can continue to push progress across political lines.

41:01.560 --> 41:07.560
We've been able to kind of bring people together who may not usually come together around

41:08.200 --> 41:11.160
some of these issues or may not be talking to one another.

41:11.960 --> 41:16.040
And so I think it really speaks to sustainability across different decision-makers.

41:16.040 --> 41:19.800
You know, when we started this, we had a different mayor than we have now, right?

41:19.800 --> 41:23.480
And both of those mayors signed on to the declaration and both of them have worked

41:23.480 --> 41:27.080
closely with us on really driving some of this work forward.

41:27.640 --> 41:30.920
And Joe, I know that you had another example that you wanted to share

41:30.920 --> 41:33.000
from a city perspective to this point.

41:34.200 --> 41:37.960
Yeah, I think when it comes to, you know, sustainability and financing, you know,

41:37.960 --> 41:42.680
I think Wello, as we've been mentioning all the time, that it has been the voice

41:42.680 --> 41:45.880
and will continue to be the voice of health and well-being for the community.

41:45.880 --> 41:49.000
And right now is really trying to use data to tell that story.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.760
So from a funding perspective, you know, having grants or funding to, you know,

41:52.760 --> 41:56.760
either to Wello or the City of Green Bay to further that data collection

41:56.760 --> 42:02.440
is going to be critical because the data that is collected is providing the evidence

42:02.440 --> 42:04.920
that we need to really drive policy change.

42:04.920 --> 42:08.600
So, you know, Wello has shown, like the case I provided, you know, there's times

42:08.600 --> 42:12.920
where Wello doesn't have data and, you know, it can create policy change.

42:12.920 --> 42:17.720
So if we have the sustainable funding, Wello can really gather that evidence

42:17.720 --> 42:21.160
and create even more of an impact in our community and drive more policy change.

42:22.120 --> 42:26.280
Absolutely. You know, one of the one example that I'll leave you with here is,

42:27.960 --> 42:32.920
you know, our city, we were able to, from that first survey, we were able to see very,

42:33.560 --> 42:39.320
very discreetly the local challenges that we have and the gaps and the inequities that we have

42:39.880 --> 42:43.400
racially for health and well-being outcomes. Right.

42:43.400 --> 42:47.960
And that was something that I think often, you know, for elected officials or for city officials,

42:48.200 --> 42:50.840
you can say, well, that's not an issue here. Right.

42:50.840 --> 42:57.480
Or that's somewhere else. And to have local data sets that very discreetly showed that case,

42:57.480 --> 43:03.880
we were able to have really great discussions in 2020 that resulted in the city really helping

43:03.880 --> 43:08.760
spearhead an effort with Wello and a local health care organization to really declare racism a

43:08.760 --> 43:15.880
public health crisis. And we did that collaboratively and brought on now over 17 other organizations

43:15.880 --> 43:22.040
from across different sectors, because we truly felt like this issue is too big for one organization.

43:22.040 --> 43:27.320
So how do we, again, together take this on, declare this as an issue that we need to take

43:28.040 --> 43:32.280
more action around when we need to start that through this declaration. So that's an example

43:32.280 --> 43:39.080
of how that data really helped drive really some of those conversations and some of those actions

43:39.080 --> 43:43.640
moving forward. So we can talk a little bit more in the Q and A around some of the challenges.

43:43.640 --> 43:49.320
I kind of listed some of the financing challenges with this model here, and I can provide that more

43:49.320 --> 43:53.800
of an example of how we've worked through that with Wisconsin DHS. So we can save that for the

43:53.800 --> 43:58.440
Q and A. But I think at the end of the day, one of the things I always think about on how to continue

43:58.440 --> 44:04.360
to sustain something like this and this movement around equitable well-being is keep people informed,

44:04.360 --> 44:11.080
keep them involved, keep them interested, and keep them inspired. So I leave you with that. And

44:11.080 --> 44:16.360
again, this is Joe and I's contact information. We'd be happy to connect with all of you

44:17.320 --> 44:20.680
offline or in the Q and A. So thank you for your time.

44:21.800 --> 44:26.120
Thank you so much, Natalie and Joe. There are so many incredible nuggets in what you shared

44:26.120 --> 44:30.840
to unpack, so I'm excited we'll have time for discussion. Just a couple of clarifying questions

44:30.840 --> 44:35.160
that came in through the Q and A before we turn to my colleague Shannon for discussion.

44:36.040 --> 44:40.520
One question is just, did Wellow have connections with the local government from the beginning,

44:40.520 --> 44:44.280
or has that developed over time? Natalie, can you just speak a bit to how this relationship

44:44.280 --> 44:50.920
got established? Absolutely. Yeah, so from the beginning, government was part of those

44:50.920 --> 44:57.800
conversations. So I mentioned kind of the beginning with that group that really came together after

44:57.800 --> 45:03.160
that editorial was created. So City of Green Bay and county government was a part of that process

45:03.160 --> 45:11.400
from the very beginning. Wonderful. And then for our NLC speakers, is there a resource for cities

45:11.400 --> 45:16.920
on best practices like here in Green Bay or ways to develop capacity to collect local data? Any

45:16.920 --> 45:23.560
resources that you'd want to lift up Sue and Lourdes? And we can bring that into the chat too.

45:24.040 --> 45:31.320
Yeah, I've reflected on this a little bit on local data. But, you know, it does depend on city

45:31.320 --> 45:39.800
capacity, you know, like even something like EMS data, right, extracting that, putting it in the

45:39.800 --> 45:46.040
context of other data sources. It's not something, you know, that most cities have the capacity

45:46.040 --> 45:51.000
outright to do. And that tends to be an area where they have more partnerships, you know,

45:51.000 --> 45:55.560
tends to be an area where they have more partnership, and it tends to be an area that

45:55.560 --> 46:00.120
we focus on more in our cohorts so that we're embedding the capacity to support them.

46:01.640 --> 46:08.520
Did that answer your question? Yes, thank you, Sue. If there are other questions or resources that

46:08.520 --> 46:14.040
folks want to lift up in the chat, please do so. Then final just question before we turn over to

46:14.040 --> 46:19.960
Shannon too, and then we'll have more Q&A time. Natalie and Joe, did you have any academic research

46:19.960 --> 46:24.360
partnerships as you've been unfolding this work? Can you describe how those have worked?

46:25.160 --> 46:28.920
And then I think this is kind of related to another question that's come up around ground

46:28.920 --> 46:33.400
truthing with community members. So maybe just a little bit more on research partnerships,

46:33.400 --> 46:38.920
in particular those related to ground truthing. Absolutely. So we really kicked this off with

46:38.920 --> 46:43.320
two research partners. We have two institutions here, University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, as well

46:43.320 --> 46:49.080
as St. Norbert College. One of the universities has what's called a Consortium for Applied Research,

46:49.080 --> 46:54.440
and the other a Strategic Research Institute. And so we actually have a co-PI model that really

46:54.440 --> 47:01.320
launched this work. And in particular, the panel study that I referenced, that is actually led

47:01.320 --> 47:05.240
by the Strategic Research Institute at St. Norbert College, meaning they really are the

47:05.240 --> 47:10.280
partner that helps us operationalize it. So because we're this nonprofit, right,

47:10.280 --> 47:15.080
in this public-private partnership, we really wanted to find where are those opportunities

47:15.080 --> 47:19.880
where, you know, with working with an academic research institute, they already have all the

47:19.880 --> 47:25.480
data privacy, security, we go through IRB for this process, but we're able to flow that through a

47:25.480 --> 47:30.200
group that does that day in and day out. And then we're actually able to then bring in the community

47:30.200 --> 47:34.040
voices and thinking about what actually is asked and how do we do it, what are those methods,

47:34.040 --> 47:38.680
those are informed by the well-owned community partners, whereas the academic partnership

47:38.680 --> 47:44.360
does that. In terms of the ground truthing, great example, we've also worked with Medical

47:44.360 --> 47:51.720
College of Wisconsin specifically around thinking about how we can further engage community members.

47:52.360 --> 47:56.520
So when we think about community-based participatory action research, right,

47:56.520 --> 48:02.120
thinking about how we can have our community members actually be researchers and really

48:02.120 --> 48:07.880
empowering and shifting power in that way. And so we've actually piloted through one of our projects

48:07.880 --> 48:12.040
that members from within the community have actually gone through the process of getting

48:12.040 --> 48:17.080
city trained and are actually going to now be the researchers for that specific project.

48:17.080 --> 48:21.160
But the idea is really thinking about what are those structures, what are those systems, and at

48:21.160 --> 48:25.160
the same time we've been, you know, we've been working with Medical College of Wisconsin saying

48:25.160 --> 48:30.200
this city training, how do we make this less complicated? Because if we want our

48:30.200 --> 48:33.880
work to be community-led and we want it to be equity-based, why are we creating all these

48:33.880 --> 48:38.600
barriers, right? We want to make sure that there are great protections for the data and that is the

48:38.600 --> 48:44.120
utmost. But what are the things that need to be there and what are the things that maybe have

48:44.120 --> 48:48.840
been there because, right? And can we push on those some of those structures?

48:50.280 --> 48:56.280
Thank you both so much. So I want to bring in my colleague Shannon Arvizu, who's a senior advisor

48:56.280 --> 48:59.800
with the Department of Commerce and has been spearheading a lot of work related to racial

48:59.800 --> 49:05.000
equity and data. So Shannon, I'll turn it over to you to just have a chat, have a dialogue with

49:05.000 --> 49:09.640
Natalie and Joe and draw out some further reflections, particularly as it relates to

49:09.640 --> 49:16.440
federal local collaboration. Yeah, thank you so much and super inspired by what you all are

49:16.440 --> 49:20.840
doing at Green Bay and examples of Tacoma as well, what the National League of Cities has done

49:20.840 --> 49:28.280
to lay the groundwork for more movement building and capacity building. I really appreciate that

49:29.800 --> 49:34.040
both of you, you know, both the National League of Cities initiative and what you are doing and

49:34.040 --> 49:41.080
Tacoma is all about meeting the cities where they are. I think that's one of the things that

49:41.080 --> 49:47.720
federal government can do better on. Oftentimes, when the federal government does produce

49:48.600 --> 49:55.240
different versions of equity maps, that the intention of those maps is to look at the

49:55.240 --> 50:03.080
broadest applicability. And one of the hindrances is that when those maps are ground truth, because

50:03.080 --> 50:09.160
they oftentimes don't go through the very rigorous process that you all are doing to make sure that

50:09.160 --> 50:14.120
it represents the voices of the people, that a lot of times those maps don't resonate and therefore

50:14.120 --> 50:20.760
aren't very useful. And so I think there's some really great approaches that you all are highlighting

50:20.760 --> 50:28.520
for us moving forward. In terms of specific questions, one of the things that I know all of

50:28.520 --> 50:33.640
us here are interested in knowing is what are some of the most important ingredients that got

50:33.640 --> 50:40.440
you to where you are today? You know, in terms of your leadership, certain types of funding, certain

50:40.440 --> 50:44.600
types of internal capacity. I know you've touched upon a few of those, but if there's something else,

50:44.600 --> 50:53.240
you know, kind of a pop open the hood, you know, kind of background maneuvering that you think

50:53.240 --> 50:57.000
also really helped you be where you are today. I would love to know.

51:00.760 --> 51:02.440
Absolutely. I'll let you start, Joe.

51:02.440 --> 51:08.120
You sure? All right, I'll be quick. So, and I promise Natalie kind of mentioned this earlier,

51:08.120 --> 51:14.360
but I promise I don't think my boss is on the line. But I do think having, you know, buy in from,

51:14.360 --> 51:18.040
you know, the leadership, the city leadership, whether it's, you know, the mayor of Green Bay

51:18.040 --> 51:22.360
really bought in other municipalities like Natalie said, and then also the county executive. So I

51:22.360 --> 51:26.680
think when you get that buy in, especially in the public private partnership, you need the buy in

51:26.680 --> 51:31.720
from the city leadership. And then I think what Wellow has done an outstanding job of is we talk

51:31.720 --> 51:35.320
about starting small, but you have to build relationships along the way. And you're not

51:35.320 --> 51:39.720
going to get it done just with Wellow partnering with the city of Green Bay or the municipalities.

51:39.720 --> 51:43.800
They have to buy in and get buy in from private leadership too, which I think they've done an

51:43.800 --> 51:48.760
outstanding job. So it's not just Wellow as a private entity and public entities, it's Wellow

51:48.760 --> 51:53.880
as a private entity and the medical providers and any other private entity in that space too. So I

51:53.880 --> 51:57.960
think it's really building the relationships and that takes time. And that's really what I think

51:57.960 --> 52:07.480
Wellow has committed to. Thank you for that. Another question relates to, how do you think

52:07.480 --> 52:15.400
some of this work is influencing decision making writ large for the city? I'm just curious if you've

52:15.400 --> 52:21.640
seen now that you have this framework in place, are you starting to see what you've developed

52:21.640 --> 52:26.520
being used as a filter for other types of niches that maybe aren't directly connected to what you're

52:26.520 --> 52:34.440
doing, but starting to see some spillover influence? Yeah, do you want me to take that one,

52:34.440 --> 52:40.120
Joe? I can kind of start. So really, I think interesting is, you know, when we started this,

52:40.120 --> 52:44.120
I think a little bit, you know, you kind of you throw something out there, right? And, you know,

52:44.120 --> 52:46.920
it was developed in partnership with our community, but there's a little bit of,

52:47.480 --> 52:53.560
I hope, you know, I hope it takes hold. And I think one of the things that we have seen is

52:53.560 --> 52:57.800
because of the different mechanisms we have in place, such as, you know, every year we have a

52:57.800 --> 53:03.400
well-being summit, right? So it brings everyone together. Again, we talk about the data. If it's

53:03.400 --> 53:07.960
an off data year, we talk about the action, the things that have been generated from it. It starts

53:07.960 --> 53:13.800
to really, I think, you know, be that frame that people are using in their mind. And I think we've

53:13.800 --> 53:19.560
seen kind of anecdotally how people have started using well-being more, have really talked a lot

53:19.560 --> 53:23.960
more about equity, have really done a lot of internal work to think about what that means for

53:23.960 --> 53:29.640
them, what that means for their organization. I provided that example around the ability to

53:29.640 --> 53:33.960
really bring that whole city council together and unanimously vote to sign onto the racism of public

53:33.960 --> 53:38.600
health crisis declaration. You know, using that local data was really instrumental in helping push

53:38.600 --> 53:43.720
that forward, as well as to Joe's point, because we had a cross-sector group that was coming

53:43.720 --> 53:48.680
alongside, it wasn't one group standing alone. It was, okay, now we have private business,

53:48.680 --> 53:53.720
we have our education institutions, we have healthcare, we have public health, you know,

53:53.720 --> 53:58.280
we have all these different groups that are standing together. So that helped, I think,

53:58.280 --> 54:03.080
really catalyze that action. But we're also seeing it in small ways. So for example, our community

54:03.080 --> 54:08.680
health improvement plan, you know, now is using some of these local data measures,

54:08.680 --> 54:14.440
as well as using it in, so I should say our community health assessment is using it,

54:14.440 --> 54:19.000
and then our community health improvement plan in some of those strategies, the strategies are

54:19.000 --> 54:23.800
actually using some of these measures to really measure their success and really start to develop

54:23.800 --> 54:30.520
further action plans with community. And then also you see things like the Asian American Resource

54:30.520 --> 54:35.160
Center, or the Asian American Professional Association, that's really popping up and

54:35.160 --> 54:40.360
emerging from our community using that data to show that there are specific inequities in those

54:40.360 --> 54:46.600
populations from this well-being survey. We have other examples from the municipal equality index

54:46.600 --> 54:51.880
at the city moving up because of different policies that are put in place to make sure that we have

54:51.880 --> 54:57.160
greater representation and inclusion of our LGBTQ plus neighbors, right? So there's all of these

54:57.160 --> 55:02.440
ripple effects that have been happening as a result of really, I think, this movement around

55:02.440 --> 55:06.600
how are we ensuring that, you know, I think to the point that was made by Amanda earlier,

55:06.600 --> 55:12.920
it's not just GDP. It is well-being. It is more broad than just those gross domestic product.

55:14.040 --> 55:18.520
Love that. Congrats on the additional momentum that you're seeing there.

55:19.560 --> 55:26.040
Also really appreciate the attention to the change management components of helping to make this stick

55:26.840 --> 55:33.640
it looks like you have a very strong strategic perspective around that. And just kind of circling

55:33.640 --> 55:40.600
back to the data side, especially as Elizabeth had mentioned, working with the Department of

55:40.600 --> 55:47.000
Commerce where a census is housed, the EA is housed, we also have, you know, NOAA is housed

55:47.000 --> 55:49.960
within the Department of Commerce, we have environmental data, economic data, associated

55:49.960 --> 55:56.520
with graphic data, and we're always looking to see how can we better support states and cities

55:56.520 --> 56:01.720
in the use of data for tracking, you know, and inspiring outcomes like the ones that you're

56:01.720 --> 56:08.520
driving towards. Just curious, offhand, are there, if there's something that you think

56:09.080 --> 56:14.200
or ways that the federal government can be a better partner with you in navigating some of

56:14.200 --> 56:19.080
your data challenges, we'd love to hear any of your top of mind thoughts in that regard.

56:19.960 --> 56:26.040
Oh, muted.

56:27.800 --> 56:35.400
Geez, you think after however many years virtual now. Yeah, so I think, you know, again, we're

56:35.400 --> 56:40.360
coming from kind of that mid-sized community perspective. And so, you know, I often say one

56:40.360 --> 56:46.440
of the things that we do well here, and I have, I just have to say we have an absolutely amazing

56:46.440 --> 56:51.320
team at Wello. These are a group of really, really dedicated community-minded individuals,

56:51.320 --> 56:57.000
and I think part of the success of this, and I'll kind of go into some of the challenges with

56:57.000 --> 57:02.360
the data, and it kind of dovetails off of this, is, you know, a lot of these things happen because

57:02.360 --> 57:08.200
there was a group of people who wouldn't let them not, right? And I don't know how to, I don't know

57:08.200 --> 57:13.800
how to bring that together in a way that, you know, it was very organic. We have a team that is just,

57:13.800 --> 57:18.040
they would not let this not move forward. And when we thought about data, and we thought about our

57:18.040 --> 57:22.200
limitations, it's, okay, how can we work with those institutions locally that have some of

57:22.200 --> 57:28.360
that capacity so that we can build our capacity even though we know we have limited resources?

57:28.360 --> 57:36.200
But I think, you know, from a federal perspective, you know, any opportunities where, you know,

57:36.200 --> 57:42.600
whether it's capacity building that can be helpful for a community organization combined with,

57:42.600 --> 57:47.480
you know, just some long-term unrestricted type funding, you know, one of the things

57:47.480 --> 57:52.360
that really was an important ingredient to get us started was our local community foundation.

57:53.320 --> 57:59.160
You know, we brought forward this idea of measuring local well-being and said we would

57:59.160 --> 58:05.960
really like a multi-year grant to help make this happen, and they really saw a vision, and they

58:05.960 --> 58:11.560
invested in it for three years at a, you know, a fairly substantial level. And I think

58:12.200 --> 58:17.880
without that type of runway to iterate and to deform the partnerships and really test what

58:17.880 --> 58:23.480
works, what doesn't work, because, you know, you can lay the best plans, but not until you do it

58:23.480 --> 58:28.600
do you really start to understand what you need more. So I think from like a federal level,

58:29.480 --> 58:34.760
really trying to understand how, with that capacity at a federal level, how can you support

58:34.760 --> 58:40.200
those small and midsize communities in particular with building their local capacity, or even if

58:40.200 --> 58:46.200
there's funding that can flow to help support those pieces, and even to the extent of being

58:46.200 --> 58:52.520
able to do some of the analysis. You know, we recently were able to actually take in-house a

58:52.520 --> 58:56.920
data and evaluation manager, and it has been transformational for the ways in which we've

58:56.920 --> 59:04.280
been able to do more direct analysis and be more real-time with some of the things that we are

59:04.280 --> 59:07.720
doing in terms of community-led projects and how we're integrating some of those different

59:07.720 --> 59:13.160
data capacities. So, you know, while we have a great academic partnership as well, it's not

59:13.160 --> 59:18.440
their full-time job, and so being able to then also have someone internal to that backbone

59:18.440 --> 59:24.040
organization has really been helpful. So again, I think from a federal perspective, you know,

59:24.040 --> 59:28.520
thinking about are there some financing mechanisms that could really be helpful, or some capacity

59:28.520 --> 59:33.960
building mechanisms, because we would love to pair, like that second part of the equation is

59:33.960 --> 59:38.520
really pairing those community conditions and those objective measures that are so beautifully

59:38.520 --> 59:43.960
collected at a federal level. So how do we pair those together and make sense of them locally for

59:43.960 --> 59:52.280
action? That's great, thank you. And since you mentioned funding and you mentioned ARP funds,

59:52.280 --> 59:56.040
I'm curious about, you mentioned blending and braiding funds, and I was wondering,

59:56.040 --> 01:00:02.360
can you just speak a little bit more? As we know, there are still opportunities for many other cities

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:07.080
to use those funds in the same way that you have, and that is one thing that we are interested in

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:13.480
focusing on for the next year, is how do we inspire more cities to use the funds in that way? So if

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:20.680
you could just speak more to how you went about blending and braiding and how you were able to

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:28.760
translate ARP to do the work that you're doing. Absolutely. Joe, do you want to speak to some of

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:33.400
those ARP funds from a city perspective first? No, you can start, I can fill it in. I guess the

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:37.640
only thing I'll say is, I was talking to Mayor Generich about this in the sense of, I think the

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:43.000
ARPA model, I think has shown to work really well with five different initiatives at the local level.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.160
So I think from the federal level, if there's more health and well-being initiatives that the

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:54.040
federal level really wants to push forward, using the ARPA model to send funds directly to local

01:00:54.040 --> 01:01:02.520
government can really work that way. Absolutely. I think here's an example I will bring forward is

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:06.200
how we've worked with our Wisconsin Department of Health Services. I had kind of mentioned that one

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:12.520
in the slide deck. Several, well, a couple years ago now, as they're kind of gearing up for

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:16.280
what would be coming down the line in terms of developing their budgets and different funding

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:21.640
mechanisms, we were able to kind of engage in conversations with them as a community-based

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:28.040
organization and really think about what were the goals and what were the values of our Wisconsin

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:31.880
Department of Health Services and how could community-based organizations help play a role

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:37.480
in that process? So it's not to say that we don't want to direct all our money to traditional public

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:42.280
health. I have a master's in public health and I love governmental public health, right? That is

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:47.640
a core area that we need, that has been underfunded and needs more funding. And at the same time,

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:54.840
how can we have that conversation as a state around how can we look at those dollars that

01:01:54.840 --> 01:02:02.600
are available? And if part of our goal is to, again, drive equity and justice and have it be

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:09.240
community-led, then we need to be thinking about moving beyond, also moving beyond some of those

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:15.720
traditional structures and thinking about where are there places where community is doing a really

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:22.280
great job? And how can we move into more of a trust-based philanthropy model where maybe these

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:29.400
are smaller organizations with budgets 5 million, 1 million, 5 million or below, where a reimbursement

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:34.680
type model may not be something that those community-based organizations can actually go

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:39.720
after. So sometimes we have good mechanisms and we're trying to flow them to community-based

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:44.920
organizations, but the fact of the matter is a lot of organizations that are doing really great

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:50.520
transformative work may not be in a position where they should even apply or even think that

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:56.360
they can apply for that because say you have a large influx of dollars. Well, if you don't have

01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:01.640
that capital on hand, and a lot of these organizations do not have large amounts of

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:06.600
capital to front that money to get reimbursed on the backside, right? So how can we rethink about

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:12.360
that funding mechanism? And maybe the reimbursement model is more of a, it's not a get rid of it all

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:17.720
together. Maybe it's a, you know, 50% is up front and the other 50 is based on reimbursement.

01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:24.600
But really thinking about what is our intended goal and how do we, if we're saying we value

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:29.240
looking at equitable well-being and recovery, how are we then supporting those community-based

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:33.960
organizations on the ground doing some of that good work and encouraging that partnership between

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:39.720
traditional public health and our state and our federal government? The result of those

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:44.760
conversations is that as some of that, those dollars are coming through the CDC to our state,

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:48.440
you know, well, it will be in a position now to actually implement some of those projects.

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:53.320
We have a very specific project, you know, looking at heart health with our African American

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:58.440
population. So it's a great example of, you know, you have to be intentional about those conversations

01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:03.800
at all levels. And so how can the federal government help provide direction to the state level so that

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:06.280
we're engaging in those local community-based solutions?

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:15.080
Thank you. Really appreciate all of your perspectives. I will pass it on back to Elizabeth.

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:23.080
Wow, that was rich. Thank you. We're going to move into a large group discussion in just a moment.

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:27.320
Before we do that, we have a couple of colleagues here from the federal plan,

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:32.040
the Equitable Long-Term Recovery and Resilience Initiative within the federal government, who

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:36.920
kind of in the spirit of these learning exchanges, we just want to invite folks in also at the federal

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:42.920
level to reflect on kind of core insights and takeaways and just, you know, share a bit about

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:47.720
what's happening in the federal context where you're situated that relates to what you've heard from

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:55.400
Green Bay and from MLC. So I will turn it over to, first I'll turn it over to Stu, who has the best

01:04:55.400 --> 01:05:00.120
title of all time that I may not try. Stu, is it okay if I just turn it to you to share your title

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:05.880
because I'm pretty sure I might mess it up? Turn it over to you first. Yes, thanks so much. Yeah,

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:13.400
there's two months in there. So I'm the Acting Strategy Branch Chief and the Office of Strategy,

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:19.240
Policy and Requirements for one of the HHS operating divisions now. It's called the

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:24.520
Administration for Strategic Preparedness Response. So we really shoehorned the work strategy in there

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:33.320
or strategic at every level. But the work that we've been doing, and I can summarize that really

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:39.080
briefly, is just to say that we're the Preparedness and Response Organization for Public Health

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:45.720
Emergencies. So a little known before the pandemic, but now of course we have the Strategic National

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:51.000
Stockpile, the successor to Operation Warp Speed, now called HCORPS, all those different elements.

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:57.160
But what I want to really reflect on is just how great it was to hear these examples

01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:01.880
for how this resilience framework is at work. And I'm giving just my perspective sort of as

01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:08.200
an analyst perspective and some of the conceptual underpinnings that we saw in when I first saw the

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:13.480
well-being framework. And it was really well highlighted in the recent Health Affairs article

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:18.280
that talked about it as sort of differentiation from the social determinants of health was that

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:24.440
it was positively stated and that it sort of borrows from the human services sort of wing of

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:29.320
the house, which always goes to no wrong door. And so no matter which way you come from the vital

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:34.760
conditions, you can contribute to the whole of resilience. And so for me, I really saw that as

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:40.840
sort of reflecting coming to it. Now, you know, ASPR has highlighted community resilience. It was

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:45.400
one of the major themes of the 2014 National Health Security Strategy. And in the recent

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:49.400
update that just came out a couple of months ago, it was highlighted again,

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:54.200
community resilience and health equity. Certainly seeing that as something that underplays

01:06:54.200 --> 01:07:02.120
national health security. But it sometimes can be a little bit qualitative or descriptive. But when

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:09.080
we get to the statement of all people and all places thriving, no exceptions, that really,

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:17.400
I think it has a sort of coherent element that gets many diverse players from so many different

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:22.040
walks of life able to contribute to this whole. And just to reflect on that, I've also had a

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:29.880
background in homeland security and there for risk, for example, is completely negatively stated.

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:37.080
It's threat, it's vulnerability, it's consequence. It's all about things you want to avoid. And yet,

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:42.040
when we look at resilience, and our office also worked on the National Strategy for Resilient

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:46.840
Public Health Supply Chain, we wanted to make sure that we stated it positively. It's a leap

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:53.000
back or towards an original popular condition. But in some ways, it's more than that. It should

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:59.640
be more than just an identification of making whole. It should be about leaping forward. And

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:05.640
so that is what I think I really was happy to see that getting away from some kind of

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:11.640
concept of resilience is sort of resist, absorb, adapt, recover. Those are also important things,

01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:15.720
but they're not generative in their outcome. It's all still in relation to some shock

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:23.400
when we have to resist or respond against. In contrast, this well-being framework is

01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:29.000
conceptually and practically allows us to square that circle. So it's an all-encompassing term that

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:35.000
allows us to talk about a constructive resilience that allows for sort of a comprehensive nature

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:41.000
and a positive aspect towards resilience being something that we can all build up

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.960
towards these better conditions. So that was really, I think, galvanizing. And as you go,

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:53.000
you'll see on the federal plan, there's a number of tools. There's a visualization tool to show all

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:59.080
the various organizations in the federal government that can contribute to this. There's the resources

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:04.840
mapping tool. I think it's over 500 programs and activities. So being able to see that

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:13.640
the ability to affect the whole through the cards, I think, was really important. And so I just want

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:18.120
to briefly say that we have a growing number of implementation opportunities across the federal

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:25.080
government in partnership with the private sector and our SLTC partners and supporting the federal

01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:32.440
plan. And it is a 10-year plan. So we're seeing that as a longer arc as well. And that really,

01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:37.480
right now, our work is on implementation and developing an analytic measurement that can

01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:42.520
support sort of a broader systems level measurement to how we could look at those things.

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:50.120
And just really excited to hear the work that's happening across communities and moving us

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:55.160
towards thriving. And we just welcome the opportunity to keep building partnerships

01:09:55.160 --> 01:10:00.840
together and better understanding. So I'll stop there. I can say more, of course. But I just

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:06.360
definitely want to hear from Laverne. Beautiful, Stu. Now, if there are more comments or questions,

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:11.080
we'll circle back to you in a discussion period. But thanks for lifting up that article. I dropped

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:16.040
a link in the chat for those who are interested, as well as a link to the ELTR plan that Stu was

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:21.480
just talking about. Laverne, I'm going to turn to you and your work in the National Institute of

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:25.800
Health. Just share a little bit about kind of what you're taking from today's discussion and

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:32.600
how it relates to the work you're spearheading. Sure. Thank you, Elizabeth. So I, like Stu,

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:39.160
was very inspired by some of the comments and discussions that took place today. I think of

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:45.240
well-being a little bit different from Stu in that I think that well-being, resilience,

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:51.480
risk mitigation, risk reduction, all of those things are complementary approaches so that we

01:10:51.480 --> 01:11:00.520
can achieve thriving. We can't achieve a thriving society unless we have someone making sure that

01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:08.600
we're reducing the risk and mitigating those adversities. And then there has to be a well-being

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:15.640
piece. There has to be an opportunity to enhance well-being. And then there, we have to be prepared

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:22.040
for resilience, right? We have to know that when that stressor or shock comes that we can recover

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:28.840
from it in an appropriate manner. And it's those things together that lead to resilience. I'm sorry,

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:36.040
that lead to thriving. But what was interesting about what was spoken on today, I thought it was

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:41.160
going to be all about data, data, data. Like everybody did say, you know, we are collecting

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:46.760
this data. We're now collecting the opportunity index and that data there. And I looked at the

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:53.880
link about what's going on, how you're looking at your equity overview at Tacoma, Washington.

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:59.240
But it wasn't really just about the data because when you think about it, even the opportunity

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:05.320
index, you probably already had that data just in a different stance when you looked at your

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:12.600
social determinants of health. It probably, probably the same areas on that map were highlighted

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:17.640
when you looked at your social determinants of health versus your opportunity index versus

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:24.840
your equity index, probably saw those same groups of neighborhoods highlighted. But what was

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:31.640
interesting, I think, what was different now, I think, is the trust that I think that Natalie

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:38.040
spoke about. She said they had healing, trust, relationship building. I think that was key

01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:44.120
because I kept asking myself, okay, so what's different about this data? Did they ask different

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:50.600
questions? Are they pursuing it differently? There must be some nuance that's different about

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:57.080
this data now. And yeah, I think there probably is some nuance and I was hoping that you all

01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:02.520
would address that during the question and answer part. But I think even more important,

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:07.560
I think the success really is coming from that building of trust. I think you wouldn't have had

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:14.920
conversations like racism as a public health crisis if you had not built that trust. And I

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:20.360
really would like to know more about how you were able to achieve that because I think that's key.

01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:26.680
And I appreciate the comment about the funding mechanisms because I think that's something

01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:38.120
especially at NIH that is so important because we might have the best ideas in mind. We might have

01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:44.520
the best hopes in mind when we come up with these fundings and we're saying, listen, we're going to

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:50.280
fund these communities so that we can uplift these communities. But then they don't have access to

01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:54.600
the funding. We're saying, oh, it's there, but they're not using it. At least that's what I hear

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:59.960
all the time. We're providing these grant opportunities, but they're not using them.

01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:08.840
So what can we do? If they can't use it, they can't use it. And I really appreciate how clearly

01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:15.320
you articulated that. Some communities, you're telling them you're going to reimburse them.

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:21.960
Well, how are they going to spend money that they don't have to be reimbursed? That makes so

01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:29.240
much sense. And so I really appreciate that comment. And I thank you again for

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:34.680
allowing me to participate on this. Thank you so much, Laverne. We did have a question come

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:40.360
in for the two of you. So, Stu, I'll prompt you first. And Laverne, please be able to jump in as

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:45.960
well. Just a question about this 10-year federal plan. It seems like it centers long-term thinking.

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:50.600
The question is really how do we ensure the continuity of this long-term thinking,

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:54.360
especially across political administrations and cycles? So could you share a little bit more

01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:58.520
about what's at the heart of that plan? Well, yeah, I think Natalie said it well

01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:05.640
when she talked about starting small. And that I'm a fan of just continuous improvement. So you

01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:11.240
get started, you see the impact, and then you do whatever it is you're doing a little bit better

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:17.160
and work towards that. It is part of the federal plan over the course of these next 10 years.

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:26.440
And so for me, it was really a light bulb moment to talk about how basic needs for transportation

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:31.240
could affect health outcomes. So coming in from HHS, I'm not going to necessarily think

01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:37.800
first about transportation, but there's all these inroads towards thriving that work towards that

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:44.520
whole. But that's why I think it's important to have it published as well to speak towards making

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:49.640
sure it's really sustained over longer term. There are these programs that you wouldn't think

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:55.400
otherwise do contribute to these overall thriving and resilience goals, but they do.

01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:02.600
And so first being able to see that whole and identifying it, I think it's an important element

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:11.240
to being sustained and maintained. And I think Aaron's leadership, I think the fact that

01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:20.360
we have started to see buy-in from every agency and the way that Aaron has brought these groups

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:28.440
of people together and people are saying, yes, we're going to change this system or we're going to

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:37.560
change this mechanism, adapt this policy. It's like once you get the ball rolling, it has momentum

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:43.400
of its own. And I think Aaron has done a great job of bringing the right people together

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:49.000
to get the ball rolling in so many different pieces or areas of the federal government

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.920
that in my opinion, you're not going to be able to stop their ball from rolling.

01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:56.680
Even if a new administration comes in, that ball is going to keep rolling.

01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:00.760
Wonderful. Thank you both so much. I'll turn it over to Tony for discussion.

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:09.480
Yeah, thank you everyone who's already shared. To let folks know, you can add more questions to

01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:14.120
the Q&A and there can be questions to any of the speakers that we've had throughout this session.

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:20.280
I want to just elevate one question that was brought up in the chat a little earlier. That

01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:26.440
came from Elias who's asking about, we've talked a lot about how we can empower these local communities

01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:32.360
to better leverage and these federal funding streams. And Elias was wondering how more cities

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:37.240
might extend opportunities to their community organizations to exercise a greater degree of

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:42.520
economic participation. And so I know you did some answering the chat, but do you or anyone else who's

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:47.080
speakers from the call just want to touch on this of how potentially funding could be better

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:53.160
used to kind of elevate the power of community organizations in their economic participation?

01:17:53.480 --> 01:18:02.040
Yeah, I would just say over the last few years, especially with COVID, public trust in government

01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:11.320
is so low, maybe at an all-time low in some places. And I think one of the great recognition

01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:21.640
of city leaders is there's a really great level of inquiry and great level experimentation

01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:30.040
on what we call community engagement to community co-design. And we've done a couple of forums just

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:36.920
with our cities of opportunity cities about some of the ways that they've really gone about

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:43.080
doing this, right, to really center community and what their needs are. And so from Rochester,

01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:49.160
Minnesota to Birmingham, Alabama, to a variety of different cities, they're really

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:57.480
trying to move this needle. And the American Rescue Plan Act was unprecedented amount of

01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:03.320
funding to cities. I think we all acknowledge that. And it really did provide the flexibility

01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:08.440
to do some things that cities haven't been able to do that easily in the past because of constraints

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:13.880
of how they can use their budget. So I use the example of Rowan Oak, Lourdes shared that right up,

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:18.440
but one of the interesting things in the way they use their ARPA dollars, they really had

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:22.760
trouble getting the community to the table because there was a lot of skepticism that

01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:29.160
something would change. And so one of the things that Rowan Oak really did was do something the

01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:34.840
communities had been asking for for a long time, which is repair broken sidewalks and street lights

01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:39.880
to show some good faith that things could be different. And I think now they've continued

01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:45.880
to sort of build on that multi-sector engagement. In Tacoma, it was really through a community-based

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:51.960
organization that really drove the community engagement and feedback on their earn and learn

01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:59.480
model. But there's a range of different approaches that cities are using. And it is a lot of

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:08.440
different methodologies in different places, which I think points to when we talk about efficiency

01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:13.960
of scale, I think one of the speakers was saying, I thought this was going to be all about data.

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:18.040
It's really the data to drive the decision-making. That's what we're after.

01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:25.720
So centering the data in the decision-making. And I think that's really what we're after here

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:31.640
and really trying to help the cities. And I think for federal agencies, every city that

01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:35.720
starts a multi-sector partnership, the first thing they want to do is a data sharing agreement.

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:41.800
And the constraints, HIPAA, FARPA, over and over and over again, reinventing the wheel

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:47.880
in every community. If there could be some coalescing of even just technical assistance,

01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:53.400
navigating this, because they all have to go through their own process every time in every

01:20:53.400 --> 01:21:00.440
discrete case. There's really no efficiency of scale to really move through this. And then I

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:07.160
think Natalie made several great points, but I think on the research and evaluation, scale what

01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:12.200
works. But a lot of cities don't have the capacity to evaluate their own programs, which

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:17.800
we've seen on a whole level of issues, including opioids. Where are your overdose deaths? Where

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:22.440
are your programs? What are the programs getting efficacy? What could you scale? It's really hard

01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:28.920
for cities to answer those questions, so we point them to academic partners. But the feds have spent

01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:34.040
so much money, even just in these last couple of funding cycles on mental health and substance use,

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:44.360
yet there's no infrastructure to support how you can tap some of that toward research and evaluation.

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:50.040
Thank you, Sue. I really wanted to echo that point. It's kind of a

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:56.680
question of analysis in program design, is really thinking about how are we making cities reinvent

01:21:56.680 --> 01:22:02.040
the wheel, and how can we design this program, this funding stream, in such a way that really

01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:07.240
empowers cities to not need to reinvent the wheel. So I think that was an incredible and

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:11.960
really important point that Sue just made. One question, and this could be answered by Sue

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:17.560
Lourdes, or especially wanted to hear from Natalie and Joe on this, do cities have an interest or

01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:22.040
use in county-level data? There was discussion here about data at the zip code level, at the

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:27.480
census track level, but one of our audience members asked, how can those of us who use

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:31.960
county-level data best work with and make our data useful for cities?

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:40.760
Natalie or Joe, do you want to start, and then I can?

01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:49.960
Yeah, absolutely. Yes, is the short answer. I think the county-level data is also very,

01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:56.760
very important. So I mentioned a little bit that I say loosely that our geographic

01:22:56.760 --> 01:23:02.040
boundary is Brown County, Wisconsin. We're in a unique position here where we have,

01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:09.880
what, 24 municipalities within Brown County. And honestly, on my drive to work in the morning,

01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:16.280
I only have a 10-minute drive, but I go through three municipalities. So these are imaginary

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:23.480
lines that are drawn. And when we think about well-being and equitable well-being and recovery

01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:27.400
and all of the things that go into creating thriving people, economies, and places,

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:32.600
it's really important that we're thinking, like for us, especially like county data is really

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:37.160
helpful because you may drive through three municipalities. We're all in the same county,

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:42.520
but it's important to be able to then distinguish those smaller units when we're thinking about

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:47.720
allocation of resources. But I would say it is very important to have county-level data as well.

01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:51.880
And you can see also then where there's some additional analysis you could do to really

01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:57.800
understand compare and contrast between zip code, census tracts, and then county-level. And I think

01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:01.960
that there's some really interesting things in terms of how you make decisions and how policies

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:07.240
would be set. But especially, I think, from a county-level, and if there could be county-level

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:12.280
policies that could move this work forward for all of those municipalities within the county,

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:17.560
that would be very, very helpful. And so to that end, I think that county data is also very good.

01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:22.840
And that's why the measurement that we do here locally, while we break it down by census track,

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:30.760
we do that analysis for our county. Yeah. And I would just add, you know,

01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:35.000
we're co-located at National League of Cities and the National Association of Counties. We're

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:41.240
co-located to try to spur really greater collaboration. And, you know, there's

01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:51.560
very distinct but very essential roles where we try to really foster city and county

01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:58.120
regional approaches. And often the counties might have a better level of resources,

01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:05.720
better level of data. So it is very fundamental to, you know, and in some places, right,

01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:11.080
like Tennessee, they've consolidated city-county government, and there is some better ability

01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:15.640
to share across city-county. But in most other places, right, they've got to,

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:21.880
where it's not set up that intentionally, they really have to work at that relationship building

01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:27.880
and really trying to bring those things together. And, you know, we try to foster that.

01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:35.000
As much as we can because of the value, especially serving across municipal boundaries,

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.520
but within a county, which I think is what Natalie's pointing to.

01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:45.720
Last question is for Joe and Natalie, about 30 seconds each. If you received a phone call

01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:51.800
from another city who wanted to do what you've done and you, you know, one piece of advice to

01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:56.200
help them in that journey, what would you recommend? And we can, Joe, we can start with you.

01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:02.760
Sure. And going off of what Natalie and Sue just talked about, you know, if you're a lot like

01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:07.960
Wisconsin and pretty unique and you have tons of municipalities, public-private partnership is

01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:11.400
probably the best way to go about it. But if you're a bigger city, then you probably want to try and

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:16.840
get it in-house a little bit. So I think that's, you kind of got to look at your area and assess

01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:21.080
what would be the best fit for that. But I think what we said all along, it's really about starting

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:25.000
small and getting those small wins and building up that momentum. That's the first thing, I think,

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.280
to get started and really kind of helped us out. And I think it will help out anyone.

01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:30.520
Thank you. Natalie?

01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:37.400
Beautiful. This is a great question. And I feel like, oh, what's the answer here? I think one of

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:44.200
the things that I always come back to is well-being is about people. And so thinking about who are those

01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:51.560
formal and informal leaders, and in many cases, it is the neighborhood associations, right? It is the

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:57.560
folks who naturally are organizers within our communities that are really going to be those

01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:02.680
folks who are the early adopters to this framework and can help bring others along. And I think it's

01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:09.880
so important to really drive and center people in all of this work, because it can get really easy

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:15.240
to bog it down with this framework or this measure. And at the end of the day, I always like to bring

01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:22.120
it back to this is about helping support and create opportunities for all people to thrive.

01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:27.800
And so how are we continuing to center people and leave that door open to engage all people

01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:33.160
in the conversation? Wonderful. Thank you very much. I'm going to turn it back over to Elizabeth

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:40.040
to take us home. Great. Well, I just want to extend a huge thank you to our speakers. There

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:44.440
were some really resonant themes. We heard a bit about the nuts and the bolts of this work, but

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:50.920
ultimately it's about thriving economies, people, places. As Natalie mentioned, it's about people.

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:57.240
It's also about our planet. I noticed that just recently the Biden-Harris administration announced

01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:03.160
$575 million in grants through NOAA to support coastal resilience, right? And so we know that

01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:10.200
the ecosystems in which we are part are counting on us to do this work. Flexible multi-year funding

01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:14.520
is crucial in this work. It sounds like there's just so much that can be learned from the use of

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:21.160
ARPA funds that we can continue to surface and exchange around. Partnerships really help address

01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:25.800
some of the capacity challenges and barriers inside local government and that we have to start

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:29.640
somewhere. We can't let perfection be the enemy of getting going in this very important work.

01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:35.400
I'm going to ask my colleague, Amanda, to just share a little bit about some of the next steps

01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:41.320
that she sees around federal and local stakeholders. Sure. Yeah. And I realize we're at time,

01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:48.360
but I want to just really hone in on the point that Natalie really made about the importance of

01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:52.360
how over the what. I think in our experience working with a lot of different governments,

01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:59.240
I would say most OECD countries now have some sort of wellbeing indicators, frameworks,

01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:04.040
but the difference between whether or not it gets stuck there or it actually transforms into

01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:09.560
meaningful reformations in terms of decision making and processes is a lot about that point

01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:15.720
of moving at the speed of trust and having broad-based support and engagement. And so

01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:21.800
this is one for the federal government. We all is really about trying to build the movement,

01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:28.120
a multi-stakeholder coalition. And so ask what kind of support do you need to feel like the work

01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:33.320
that you're doing is really going to be backed by society and a wide range of actors in order to

01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:39.080
feel like that's sustainable. And then at the city level, I think there's a huge amount of really

01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:44.200
exciting innovations that are looking at new types of deliberation, decision-making process,

01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:49.560
and also strategies that try to bring together things like participatory budgeting, community

01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:54.280
wealth building, circular economy, and all of these different strategies together. And so if

01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:59.720
there's ever any interest in connecting with other cities globally, or we can provide some

01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:03.640
experiences from our sort of piloting with cities around the world in this work,

01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:08.680
love to offer that and really look forward to our next discussion. Thanks.

01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:12.920
Thank you, Amanda. So we'll be sharing out a recording of the discussion. We'll include

01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:18.200
the tremendous amount of resources that were serviced in the chat. And just know that this

01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:22.760
is the second in a kind of learning series that we're really hoping to continue cultivating where

01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:27.640
we can exchange on these ideas, certainly across different levels of government and with the many

01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:32.600
allies and partners we have in communities around the country. So thank you for your time,

01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:35.160
and hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day. Take care.

01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:37.720
Thank you. Bye-bye.
