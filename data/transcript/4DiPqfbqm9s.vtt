WEBVTT

00:13.763 --> 00:14.103
Yeah.

00:44.815 --> 00:45.416
Okay.

01:14.705 --> 01:14.865
Okay.

01:46.547 --> 01:46.847
Okay.

02:45.695 --> 02:46.055
do do

03:12.765 --> 03:12.865
you

05:16.058 --> 05:21.883
Okay, the board will convene and with the salute to the flag is the first order of business.

05:24.345 --> 05:38.276
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

05:39.657 --> 05:44.982
Okay, we have first order of business will be to swear in our new member.

05:46.379 --> 05:50.180
And then the board will adjourn for executive session.

05:50.260 --> 05:55.201
So you're all just getting seated and you'll have to leave for the executive session.

05:55.281 --> 05:56.301
I'm sorry about that.

05:58.122 --> 05:59.842
But that's the way we need to proceed.

05:59.922 --> 06:08.364
So the first order of business, I will have our new member come forward, Olivia Sisson, who is our student member.

06:08.424 --> 06:10.084
More about her background later.

06:14.540 --> 06:19.283
OK, if you'll raise your right hand and put your left hand on the, hold that.

06:19.303 --> 06:21.185
Yes, thank you.

06:21.205 --> 06:22.706
OK.

06:22.726 --> 06:25.127
I, Olivia Sisson, do solemnly swear.

06:25.147 --> 06:27.589
I, Olivia Sisson, do solemnly swear.

06:28.069 --> 06:31.692
That I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States.

06:31.972 --> 06:35.014
That I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States.

06:35.414 --> 06:38.116
Against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

06:38.417 --> 06:40.418
Against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

06:41.175 --> 06:50.678
that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the United States, and the Constitution of the State of California, that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion,

07:07.901 --> 07:17.206
and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which I am about to enter.

07:18.526 --> 07:18.927
Thank you.

07:18.967 --> 07:27.331
You're now a member of the State Board of Education.

07:27.351 --> 07:36.536
Okay, with that done, we will need to clear the room and we will then proceed with our executive session and during that executive session

07:38.641 --> 07:40.603
We will consider the cases of D.J.

07:42.143 --> 07:45.706
v. the State and related complaint from the U.S.

07:45.746 --> 07:50.108
Department of Justice and Vergara v. the State of California.

08:58.746 --> 08:59.026
Yeah.

09:25.677 --> 09:26.017
Yeah.

10:05.640 --> 10:05.700
you

10:37.216 --> 10:37.436
Yeah.

11:22.350 --> 11:23.452
you you

12:01.155 --> 12:01.515
Yeah.

15:04.286 --> 15:04.366
you

19:18.188 --> 19:18.648
do do

19:47.560 --> 19:48.020
do do

20:14.554 --> 20:14.854
do do

21:11.385 --> 21:11.685
Yeah.

21:43.151 --> 21:43.551
Yeah.

22:07.884 --> 22:07.944
you

22:39.073 --> 22:39.193
So,

24:01.920 --> 24:02.080
Yeah.

24:31.277 --> 24:31.657
Yeah.

25:27.108 --> 25:27.649
Yeah.

25:57.735 --> 25:58.295
do do

27:06.064 --> 27:06.184
do

28:13.295 --> 28:13.935
Yeah.

28:49.261 --> 28:50.081
Yeah.

32:41.002 --> 32:52.168
Okay, the board will reconvene and I need to announce that the report out on the closed session, the board discussed and or took action on the following cases.

32:52.809 --> 32:53.289
D.J.

32:53.329 --> 32:56.231
versus State and related complaint from the U.S.

32:56.271 --> 33:00.393
Department of Justice and Vigara versus the State of California.

33:01.134 --> 33:03.215
Now we're ready for the report of the superintendent.

33:04.696 --> 33:25.699
Thank You mr. President board members good morning and back to school summer is winding up a lot of excitement as students and teachers Get back to the classrooms The biggest news of the last month that to share with you right at the start here is the progress we've made as indicated on our assessment and I hand it out to you all a chart showing that in

33:26.910 --> 33:36.438
the Smarter Balance assessments, we have seen significant gains in all categories across the state, all student groups.

33:37.119 --> 33:41.063
And the chart I have shared with you, I think, summarizes that.

33:41.083 --> 33:44.306
I won't go into detail, but just to point out that there was a 5% increase

33:46.167 --> 33:53.771
across all students for English language arts and four percent increase across all student groups for our mathematics.

33:55.072 --> 34:05.558
You can see the breakdown of different student groups from Hispanic and Latino, African-American, Asian, ethnicities, disadvantaged students, English learners.

34:06.758 --> 34:10.380
And so you see a pretty good summary here and challenges.

34:11.301 --> 34:12.522
While there's momentum

34:13.562 --> 34:15.884
There's still a long way to go to address the achievement gap.

34:16.925 --> 34:26.954
We're thankful for the thousands of teachers, administrators, parents, students who cooperated so well in having the assessment for 3.2 million students successfully implemented.

34:27.654 --> 34:36.702
We also want to thank Michelle's Center and Kerrick Ashley, everyone else on the CDE team who helped make that possible, and the board staff team who helped make that possible.

34:38.015 --> 34:45.459
I want to thank Eagle Rock Elementary School in Los Angeles who hosted us, where we were joined by Superintendent Michelle King and L.A.

34:45.659 --> 34:46.960
Board President Steve Zimmer.

34:47.800 --> 34:52.643
And then we went from there to San Leandro High School back up in Northern California here.

34:53.503 --> 34:56.564
and just put a spotlight on great things going on there.

34:56.764 --> 35:09.990
While the state average was 5% in English language arts, in San Leandro High School, they had a 10% increase for African Americans and an 8% increase for Latinos, just to give you an example on English language arts.

35:10.851 --> 35:14.755
So we're grateful for these good examples that are making their way forward.

35:15.295 --> 35:24.105
The other extraordinary thing compared to the national scene was that we only had an opt-out of 1% of parents saying they didn't want their students to take the test.

35:24.825 --> 35:31.753
New York, the exemption rate reached 20%, and in Washington State, for 11th graders, it was more like 50% opt-out.

35:33.474 --> 35:54.657
So, collective good work of the state board, President Kurz, the governor, all of us on my team, and the education stakeholders around the state that we set a positive climate for proceeding and basically reached a pretty strong consensus that this is the right way to go and had parent cooperation in that.

35:55.617 --> 36:06.541
The next thing I wanted to report on was the English Learner Roadmap Workgroup and invite anybody interested in joining that group to help us develop a resource guide for English learners.

36:07.582 --> 36:13.284
We are pleased we received the CE Foundation from the Sobrato family a grant to

36:15.005 --> 36:16.146
produce this roadmap.

36:16.307 --> 36:26.539
This guide will assist local education agencies as they implement California's 21st century college and career standard goals, curriculum and instruction programs.

36:27.000 --> 36:32.146
Applications and resumes are due by the 29th of September if you're interested in joining.

36:33.763 --> 36:39.666
We've seen longer, earlier, more intense fire challenges around the state.

36:40.187 --> 36:45.550
Wanted to let you know that through emergency powers that I have as superintendent, we're making districts whole.

36:45.610 --> 36:50.292
If they had to shut down classes, if they had to shut down schools and lost attendance.

36:50.993 --> 36:55.755
So that is something we've been working actively with school districts in the areas stricken by the fires.

36:56.776 --> 37:01.999
During the three days I served as acting governor, some of you might know that I had that opportunity.

37:02.979 --> 37:13.665
I signed emergency declarations to enable California to receive millions of dollars in FEMA and federal money to, again, help our communities recover from these fires.

37:13.765 --> 37:19.148
And went to the fire scenes themselves to thank the firefighters who are doing a noble job.

37:20.089 --> 37:29.975
The other very important thing that I did as acting governor was I declared one of the days of the three days to be, change lives, become a teacher.

37:30.675 --> 37:38.642
And just put a spotlight on the teacher shortage and on the value of being an educator, being a teacher, the great personal rewards and professional satisfaction.

37:39.683 --> 37:51.574
So with that, I also would say the good news is still there in terms of polling that I've seen where the public believes we need to invest in schools and that the progress we're making is something that the public is pleased with.

37:52.474 --> 37:59.418
across from lower class sizes and bringing back art, music, drama, civics, and other technology improvements in the schools.

37:59.918 --> 38:10.404
So I'll just mention again that I'm strongly in favor of Prop 55 getting passed and renewed, and Prop 51, which is the school facilities, a $9 billion measure.

38:10.444 --> 38:18.388
So the first Prop 55 brings in about $8 billion a year, seven to eight billion, and Prop 51 will bring in one time $9 billion.

38:19.589 --> 38:28.754
So with that, I have one last pleasure to share with you the appointment and introduction of two new CDE division directors.

38:29.395 --> 38:31.356
So I'd like to introduce them to you.

38:31.696 --> 38:34.118
You'll be seeing them more frequently here at the board.

38:34.618 --> 38:36.179
One is Donna Wyatt.

38:36.479 --> 38:39.341
She's the new director of Career and College Transition Division.

38:39.801 --> 38:44.984
She has extensive experience in career technical education at the classroom, county, and district levels.

38:45.664 --> 38:52.651
And she most recently comes from working as the head of the CTE Curriculum Instruction Office in the Oakland Unified District.

38:52.691 --> 38:55.674
So with that, Donna, there she is.

38:55.735 --> 38:58.337
So welcome, officially.

39:01.533 --> 39:02.214
her first meeting.

39:03.234 --> 39:12.121
And the other person's a little more familiar, a little more close to home here for us, Kristen Wright, who has been doing a wonderful job for the State Board.

39:13.261 --> 39:22.328
She is the new Special Education Division Director, and this is a very important position that we were so pleased that she was able to come forward and

39:23.129 --> 39:38.265
Take this, she has more than a decade of experience working in special education, obviously did a great job being liaison between the State Board and CDE, and her background in special education brings a wealth of personal and classroom experience to a new role.

39:38.305 --> 39:42.610
So Kristen doesn't need introduction, but please stand up in her new position.

39:46.311 --> 39:49.753
And with that, Mr. President, we're ready to move forward.

39:49.933 --> 39:50.313
Okay.

39:50.853 --> 39:52.154
Thank you very much on that.

39:52.854 --> 39:57.396
And we appreciate meeting the two new staff members and look forward to working closely with them.

39:58.156 --> 40:01.718
And I wanted to have several announcements to make.

40:01.738 --> 40:07.240
I'm going to give a little bit more background on our new student member, Olivia Sisson.

40:08.421 --> 40:10.202
She is a student at the C.K.

40:10.262 --> 40:12.643
McClatchy High School right here in Sacramento.

40:13.681 --> 40:19.966
And she's been active in the student council since 2015 and is currently the student body secretary.

40:22.528 --> 40:30.515
Olivia's held several positions at the Sacramento City Youth Commission since 2014, including events coordinator and treasurer.

40:31.263 --> 40:37.388
She tutors in the Sacramento Reading Partners and is an active member of Venture Crew 136.

40:39.289 --> 40:50.578
Finally, I'd like to mention she has been a ballet dancer since 2001, performing with the Sacramento Ballet and as a soloist with the Crocker Dean Ballet Company.

40:51.719 --> 40:54.141
When she finds any time to relax, I don't know.

40:55.822 --> 40:58.765
So welcome and we look forward to working with you.

41:00.379 --> 41:02.380
Okay, will their parents stand up please?

41:11.145 --> 41:13.566
This is quite a meeting to get your inaugural with.

41:15.787 --> 41:24.032
And so I also have an announcement about a new staff person in the State Board of Education office and would like to welcome Leilani

41:25.970 --> 41:33.577
Aguinaldo, who is joined the SBP office team as Director of Policy and Legislation.

41:34.497 --> 41:46.488
Lalani comes to us from the governmental relations work and through for Los Angeles Unified School District, where she was a director.

41:46.548 --> 41:49.851
And prior to that, she worked for Assemblymember

41:51.468 --> 42:05.332
Furutani as legislative director and previously was a legislative advocate for both the Asian Americans for Civil Rights and Equality, as well as the law offices of Ignacio Hernandez.

42:06.273 --> 42:10.074
She graduated from UC Berkeley with a BA in economics.

42:11.615 --> 42:16.536
I'd also like to announce that... Should we have her stand?

42:16.616 --> 42:18.577
Yes, let's have her stand.

42:18.597 --> 42:19.117
Please stand up.

42:23.141 --> 42:31.523
I'd also like to announce that Malia Gonsalves has joined the State Board of Education Office as an Executive Assistant.

42:31.763 --> 42:36.684
Board members, she will be handling office scheduling, helping with agenda items, and posting.

42:37.344 --> 42:39.965
So let's have Malia stand.

42:41.185 --> 42:41.645
She's here.

42:41.665 --> 42:44.726
Way in the back.

42:47.480 --> 43:03.926
Finally, I'd like to acknowledge Kristen Wright's departure from the State Board of Education Office, where she has been our staff person on special education, computer science, and other areas of interest within and concern for the board.

43:04.066 --> 43:15.991
And of course, as Tom announced, she's the new Director of Special Education Division at the CDE, so we'll be working closely and continue with our

43:16.731 --> 43:22.654
interaction with her over many important issues in the special education field.

43:22.734 --> 43:26.376
So I would like you to join me in wishing her and her new appointment.

43:32.067 --> 43:36.808
I'd like to announce that we are recruiting for four of our advisory councils.

43:37.448 --> 43:41.029
We had an announcement on September 6th.

43:42.109 --> 43:53.892
We're looking for people on a county superintendent to the advisory commission on charter schools, a curriculum coordinator and classroom teacher to the Child Nutrition Advisory Council,

43:55.183 --> 44:06.991
a superintendent to serve on, or other administrator to serve on the California Practitioners Advisory Group, and we're also recruiting for 2017-18 student board members.

44:08.912 --> 44:11.374
Finally, next, a change in the agenda item.

44:12.635 --> 44:18.839
There was a revision to waiver item seven, which was posted on Tuesday, September 6th.

44:20.601 --> 44:25.569
Spanish interpreter services will be available for all for our items this morning.

44:26.190 --> 44:29.896
We have two public hearings, item 12 and item 13.

44:32.087 --> 44:35.049
We also have two addendum.

44:35.229 --> 44:40.972
Item 4 has an addendum as does item 11 have an addendum.

44:42.292 --> 44:46.094
The consent calendar and waiver requests are as following.

44:47.155 --> 44:49.936
We proposed waiver consent calendar items

44:50.697 --> 44:57.021
be on consent W01, W02, and W06 through W17.

44:57.901 --> 45:08.768
And then the proposed regular consent calendar includes items on our board agenda 6 through 11 in that order.

45:09.428 --> 45:15.532
So now I have the reminders for the board and the audience.

45:17.132 --> 45:25.316
If you want to remove items from proposed consent calendars, board members, please advise our executive director by 3 p.m.

45:25.396 --> 45:25.816
today.

45:27.196 --> 45:34.499
You have your electronic folder and our agenda can be accessed through an electronic agenda.

45:35.499 --> 45:39.201
The audience, you need to sign in at a table just outside the room.

45:40.141 --> 45:44.183
Binders are on the table with separate pages for each item number.

45:45.887 --> 45:49.689
Please put down the item number for which you would like to speak.

45:50.390 --> 45:58.936
And we have a general public comment item of 14, which does not specifically address any items listed on the board's agenda.

46:00.303 --> 46:09.586
Public comment will be limited to one minute per speaker and the red signal will signal you when your time limit is up.

46:10.767 --> 46:21.170
If you want to give the board members anything or submit any copies, please leave 25 copies with the staff at the front desk here on my right.

46:22.411 --> 46:24.932
Speakers, please introduce yourself.

46:25.692 --> 46:30.534
and the organization you represent before you begin to speak.

46:31.955 --> 46:39.217
And we have tv monitors also with overflow rooms for the crowd at this point.

46:40.298 --> 46:46.720
So board members, if you need to recuse yourselves, please do so before any discussion on the item.

46:47.621 --> 46:52.403
So we're now ready for item one and I want to sort of give us the order of

46:53.383 --> 46:54.784
what we're going to do here.

46:55.364 --> 46:58.025
I'm going to make a few framing remarks at the beginning.

46:59.566 --> 47:12.092
Then Nancy Brownell and Carrick Ashley will make a proposal which will include the motion in their proposal and they will also make a presentation on background items.

47:13.314 --> 47:21.018
Then we will call on our liaison board, liaisons on this item, board member Strauss, board member Burr.

47:22.079 --> 47:24.880
Then we will ask for board member technical questions.

47:25.941 --> 47:34.125
And after those are done, we will proceed to public comment so that the board can hear that after they're clarified on technical questions.

47:34.205 --> 47:37.707
And then we will have board deliberation.

47:39.370 --> 47:42.051
And so that'll be our order of business at this point.

47:42.811 --> 47:47.031
So let me just make a few overall remarks about this.

47:48.472 --> 47:57.833
There are many functions of accountability, not just finding schools and districts that are not meeting performance standards.

47:58.633 --> 48:07.355
This accountability plan also wants to better understand what's going on in districts and schools in order to figure out how better to assist and improve them.

48:09.937 --> 48:20.425
These many functions require a broader base and conceptual framework for accountability than we've had in the past.

48:21.206 --> 48:28.172
Secondly, the Board is implementing a law of the Legislature from 2013, the Local Control Funding Formula.

48:29.312 --> 48:37.254
That law contained eight state priorities, 22 specified metrics, and 13 subgroups.

48:37.974 --> 48:47.636
So this is going to be complex, and we're going to talk about how we will communicate with the public about this, but we're implementing the law.

48:48.096 --> 48:51.097
And the law outlines, as our attachment 4 indicates,

48:52.877 --> 48:58.921
clear intervention and technical assistance policies for this accountability program.

48:58.961 --> 49:07.066
And so we're really just an attachment four on what the procedure is to intervene and provide technical assistance.

49:07.126 --> 49:10.308
We're following the law very closely on that.

49:11.309 --> 49:14.571
Third, we have aligned to the federal statute.

49:15.999 --> 49:19.600
But not to the proposed federal regulations by the U.S.

49:20.020 --> 49:21.420
Secretary of Education.

49:22.421 --> 49:32.683
The Secretary of Education in Washington received 21,000 comments, including many comments from us, many other states and organizations.

49:33.263 --> 49:36.084
And so we really don't know what the regulations will be.

49:37.164 --> 49:39.625
We'll probably not find out until

49:40.845 --> 49:46.748
at least December, and I expect a lot of these issues will go over to the next administration.

49:48.409 --> 50:02.315
We have five top-line state indicators in our program, which also satisfy the five top-line indicators required by the federal Every Student Succeeds statute.

50:03.544 --> 50:10.368
But we also have a mix of state standards that are uniform across the states and local indicators.

50:11.048 --> 50:31.260
So areas of school climate, parent engagement, for example, will be locally designed indicators and the state will vet various instruments that locals might use for these surveys and they will be related to the local control and accountability plans called LCAP.

50:32.648 --> 50:40.190
Finally, any prototypes you've seen of what we're doing is sort of like looking at the operating system for a new phone.

50:41.071 --> 50:43.332
It is not the end user product.

50:43.972 --> 50:52.054
We have been, I think, unfairly criticized in some cases that this is not what your iPhone you're going to end up with.

50:52.094 --> 50:54.095
This is the operating system of the iPhone.

50:54.455 --> 50:56.716
So yes, it does look more confusing.

50:57.296 --> 51:14.603
We have some months after this to actually devise what the end user will see in that regard, and it won't be as complex as the kind of displays we've had to do so far as we deliberate on this system.

51:15.163 --> 51:23.446
And lastly, this is an action that will be taken with a commitment towards continuous improvement.

51:24.387 --> 51:29.889
We will, as outlined in our attachments, be studying several improvements.

51:30.049 --> 51:31.250
This is the baseline.

51:31.870 --> 51:36.232
We, for example, will substitute chronic absence for suspensions.

51:36.352 --> 51:38.072
Suspensions will only last a year.

51:39.133 --> 51:43.795
And that gives you an idea that it is indeed a continuous improvement project.

51:44.555 --> 51:58.697
So, with those framing comments, I would like then for our presenters to come up and present their analysis and discuss our motion.

52:01.428 --> 52:08.274
Good morning, board members, Superintendent Torlakson, public members here, nice to see you today.

52:09.896 --> 52:21.126
Just a little reminder, we do have a new technology system, so I know that our folks in the booth there are working on it, but if odd things happen, it might be because of that.

52:22.067 --> 52:23.909
If other odd things happen, I don't know.

52:24.770 --> 52:26.051
My name is Nancy Brown-Allen.

52:26.071 --> 52:27.712
I'm staff to the State Board of Education.

52:27.752 --> 52:30.253
It's a pleasure to talk about item one.

52:30.293 --> 52:36.277
And my colleague, Carrick, will be joining me at times to talk about more specificity.

52:36.377 --> 52:40.079
So a little bit of the brief context.

52:40.199 --> 52:51.366
Obviously, this item has been one that has been a discussion at board meetings and many other opportunities with stakeholders.

52:53.067 --> 53:02.752
A reminder, obviously, that for the last really six months or so, there has been a lot of intense work evolving the system.

53:03.613 --> 53:21.543
In March, the adoption or the discussion of the architecture of the accountability and continuous improvement system and the thinking on your part and staff recommendations related to how the component pieces need to be considered in the larger context.

53:22.203 --> 53:36.412
In May, the determination of looking at a balance of local and state measures and plans for really moving towards this one coherent local, state, and federal system ultimately for accountability and improvement.

53:36.993 --> 53:47.399
In July, robust discussion about the standards and performance expectations with some additional direction to staff to continue to develop.

53:49.261 --> 54:01.310
Both the standards and the look at how a web-based rubric system could work and how the design features need to be considered.

54:02.071 --> 54:08.496
September, obviously, we are here, and this is not about approving the template today.

54:09.176 --> 54:13.180
That has been delayed, but about really looking at the evaluation rubrics.

54:13.940 --> 54:19.364
So, as usual in this item, there were some memos in August that really went into great detail.

54:20.185 --> 54:33.776
You additionally have passed out in your folders some of the lookup tables around the setting of the performance expectations for the state standards as just a quick reference.

54:34.836 --> 54:48.584
The attachments that are here really focus on the overview of the design elements for the evaluation rubrics, the actual proposed standards for the state standards,

54:49.384 --> 55:09.242
and the proposed standards for the local performance indicators, along with some criteria for eligibility of technical assistance, support, and more intensive intervention, a draft timeline, obviously, of the work that will be continuing to move forward, and references to the California Code.

55:10.562 --> 55:12.503
relative to LCFF.

55:12.603 --> 55:16.465
I've circled the attachments 1, 2, 3, 4 specifically.

55:16.986 --> 55:29.371
These are really linked to the actions you are taking today specific to moving the development of the LCFF rubrics particularly.

55:30.740 --> 55:37.486
So staff thought it would be helpful to sort of ground us in the recommendations for action.

55:37.866 --> 55:50.097
This is, for many of us, kind of a momentous opportunity to move to the next phase of implementation of the LCFF.

55:50.877 --> 55:54.140
system as a whole, including now the evaluation rubrics.

55:54.661 --> 56:09.294
So just as a reminder, the purpose of the discussion today and the input from the public is really focused on the actions that hopefully you will be taking through the course of the meeting.

56:09.794 --> 56:14.639
So this is quite a hefty recommendation, as noted in the item itself.

56:15.800 --> 56:26.738
The first one, which is linked to attachment one, really focuses on the following components that have been evolving over time based on a concise set of indicators.

56:28.163 --> 56:45.095
both state and local for the evaluation rubrics, the identification of the performance standards, the criteria for determining the local agency LEA eligibility, the statements of model practices, and links to additional resources.

56:45.635 --> 56:53.380
Those are the big concepts that actually are part of the design features that make up the rubric system, which I will be talking about in more detail.

56:54.901 --> 57:12.230
The second part of the recommendation, which is included in Attachment 2, focuses on really the proposed performance standards based on the methodology that was approved in the prior meeting to establish the cut scores and performance categories.

57:12.750 --> 57:20.594
And that folder that you have from the department staff really has the background in summary fashion of those charts in case you should need it.

57:22.042 --> 57:50.536
This is, again, looking at the cut scores and categories for progress of English learners, high school graduation rate, college and career indicator, suspension rates by LEA type, and as noted on the slide, these are linked to the specific priorities, as Mike mentioned in the introductory comments, around the priorities identified in the legislation.

57:53.342 --> 58:04.509
Continuing as part of attachment three, the recommendations are for the proposed standards for the local performance indicators.

58:05.290 --> 58:23.102
And as noted and as you'll see in the models and obviously what was identified in great detail both in the August memo and in the item itself is the focus on the capacity to take a look at the local performance indicators through the lens of MET

58:23.742 --> 58:31.910
not met for two years because there is not a complete set of data available for all of these.

58:32.530 --> 58:41.038
So those are listed there, including Priorities 9 and 10, which focus on the expectations of county programs in their LCAPs.

58:42.353 --> 58:50.277
And lastly in this section is the criteria for determining eligibility for technical assistance.

58:50.897 --> 59:10.627
This is again been an increasing set of recommendations moving forward that the purpose obviously of using the rubrics also entails the kinds of support and technical assistance in a continuous improvement model that would be of use to districts across the state.

59:11.107 --> 59:13.049
And that's outlined in Attachment 4.

59:14.170 --> 59:27.881
In addition to those major actions, there are four additional focused areas for continued development of the system by staff.

59:28.522 --> 59:32.365
And so, as you well know, this has been an ongoing project.

59:32.986 --> 59:35.428
We're reaching a point where there are a lot of pieces in play.

59:35.468 --> 59:38.871
There will be continuing development of the work moving forward.

59:39.571 --> 59:52.875
including, as number six indicates here, approve the proposed process by which the State Board will be able to review the evaluation rubrics, particularly in this first couple of years.

59:53.095 --> 01:00:03.659
Obviously, the ongoing work will be informed by the use by local education agencies, charter schools, county programs,

01:00:04.579 --> 01:00:23.207
So that opportunity within this first year really is a part of the board's role in continuous improvement as noted in some of the principles for developing a new system is that we've all got to get better at what we're doing at both the policy and the practical level to really support our schools and districts.

01:00:24.545 --> 01:00:39.467
So a reminder that the work staff has done since July was really based on the approved design of the evaluation rubrics that included as noted in the prior

01:00:40.488 --> 01:00:57.395
board items, a concise set of state and local performance indicators, the standards, which have been discussed over both the May and the July state board meetings, and the methodologies for determining those.

01:00:58.255 --> 01:01:08.661
The criteria for determining eligibility for technical assistance as provided again in the statute with some very specific language of when that needs to occur.

01:01:09.682 --> 01:01:20.389
And the ongoing work on the draft statements of model practices as options to assist schools and districts and the links to much more detailed resources.

01:01:21.525 --> 01:01:40.485
So given that, the importance here in the decisions you're making today go back to, again, some of what President Kirsch said this morning, that the accountability and continuous improvement system has really been focused for the last two years on

01:01:41.165 --> 01:01:46.869
much more about the local control and accountability plans and the annual updates as districts have implemented those.

01:01:47.589 --> 01:02:05.900
The evaluation rubrics are a new tool coming on board for use this year and moving forward, and the context of the support and assistance system as a part of the entire efforts to build a system that does focus on continuous improvement.

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:17.805
Just a reminder that the evaluation rubrics, as identified in the LCFF statutes, are intended to serve some major purposes.

01:02:17.885 --> 01:02:27.230
To support LEAs in identifying their strengths and weaknesses in areas needed for improvement, to assist in whether LEAs are

01:02:28.190 --> 01:02:52.043
eligible for a tiered system of technical assistance leading to more intense intervention for pervasive problems, perhaps, and to assist the superintendent in determining whether LEAs are eligible for more intensive state and support and, of course, the ongoing work that the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence will be doing.

01:02:53.144 --> 01:03:07.468
So, the work that you're seeing today and the decisions you're making really focus on the statutory deadline of October 1st, 2016 that was extended from last year.

01:03:08.009 --> 01:03:11.750
As you might remember, boy, a long time ago, September 2015 feels like.

01:03:14.191 --> 01:03:38.881
The initial phase of this implementation really provides opportunities for LEAs to work with the rubrics along with other interested groups to see how this information then can become useful to them in analyzing their LCAPs and moving toward their annual updates and priorities in terms of their actions and services that may be needed as a result of what the data is showing.

01:03:39.641 --> 01:03:52.691
And the goal has been simultaneously that this web-based system be user-friendly to multiple groups of audiences, which, as President Kirst mentioned, this is a complex system.

01:03:54.052 --> 01:04:06.682
Some in the public, I think, have criticized some of the work in the press, for example, but the idea is when you're moving toward a much more holistic, multidimensional system,

01:04:07.182 --> 01:04:12.104
how that looks and what you are able to communicate really becomes critically important.

01:04:13.305 --> 01:04:31.473
So, the components of the LCFF evaluation rubrics that we have been working with through the course of the last, really, 18 months is this notion that, as Member Strauss and I like to talk about, those of us that are very familiar with rubrics

01:04:32.673 --> 01:04:38.737
have struggled a little bit as many stakeholders have is, what kind of rubric is this?

01:04:39.717 --> 01:04:47.682
And this is a different kind of rubric if you are an English teacher or a math teacher or a history teacher that looks at a four or five point spread.

01:04:48.422 --> 01:04:58.648
This is the very weak dimensions, these are the very strong dimensions and we'll give you a number and that'll get translated into a wonderful grade on your capacity as a student.

01:05:00.489 --> 01:05:05.714
It has many dimensions of that, but the components are that there's a top-level data.

01:05:06.844 --> 01:05:12.287
display that gives a quick picture of how a school's district and student groups are doing.

01:05:12.728 --> 01:05:24.935
There is the data analysis tool that is able to move into more detailed data reports and you'll see some prototype mock-ups today that might include that.

01:05:25.456 --> 01:05:29.598
The statements of model practices and the links to additional resources.

01:05:30.058 --> 01:05:32.240
That is the picture of

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:40.026
what the evaluation rubric system includes at this particular initial phase of work.

01:05:40.927 --> 01:05:45.391
So the design repeats from the prior slide that we have been working on.

01:05:46.111 --> 01:05:56.440
And this slide 13 is an example of staff taking advice from the board, as always, from the July meeting.

01:05:57.100 --> 01:06:13.283
We worked with our colleagues at WestEd and brought in a graphic designer who has much more knowledge of iconography than most of us do, also have the capacity to use the kind of technology programs that allow you to do this kind of work.

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:25.685
So this is a simple example that we also spent some time, August 20th, there was a policy discussion on August 19th

01:06:26.765 --> 01:06:30.370
with an array of stakeholders about some of these models.

01:06:30.850 --> 01:06:45.128
There was an additional webinar on August 26th that WestEd sponsored that allowed people to kind of look at some of these mock-ups in a way to give feedback, but the concept here is much different than our last little

01:06:46.589 --> 01:06:48.810
Excel spreadsheet set of boxes.

01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:51.651
This, again, is a model.

01:06:51.771 --> 01:06:57.132
This is not, I'll repeat, this is not necessarily the final product.

01:06:57.813 --> 01:07:10.897
But the idea that here would be a simple kind of look at here are the state standards, here are the local, on this one they said self-assessment indicators.

01:07:10.957 --> 01:07:14.278
Again, this was an early prototype from three weeks ago, I think.

01:07:14.958 --> 01:07:31.287
The color coding, which I'm going to talk about in more detail related to setting the status and change dimensions across the packet you have for the cut scores, and the idea then that by clicking on the arrows,

01:07:32.487 --> 01:07:34.828
and you could get to much more detail.

01:07:35.368 --> 01:07:46.712
But we actually were quite pleased with this as a way to begin to help shape how a web-based system would really look in the system.

01:07:47.772 --> 01:07:54.834
So on that note, I'm going to, oh, and I have to say it because it's such a great story.

01:07:54.874 --> 01:08:00.336
The icons on this particular graphic are called Harvey Balls.

01:08:00.953 --> 01:08:04.415
They are called Harvey Balls.

01:08:05.055 --> 01:08:08.818
They are the round ideograms that consumer reports use.

01:08:08.858 --> 01:08:13.521
They are actually a technical term that helps visual communication.

01:08:15.302 --> 01:08:15.562
Yes?

01:08:16.644 --> 01:08:20.047
They are commonly used to describe complex data.

01:08:21.167 --> 01:08:29.974
Harvey Poppel is the inventor of these, not to be confused with Harvey Balls, who invented the smiley face.

01:08:30.474 --> 01:08:37.940
So a little factoid of information that we learned in the development of this that who'd have thought.

01:08:40.081 --> 01:08:45.826
So as a result of this initial look at information,

01:08:49.838 --> 01:08:53.580
Oh, okay, well, I think if I get to this one, it'll be easier, but thank you.

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:55.981
And I'll try to come back on that.

01:08:56.101 --> 01:09:15.309
So taking that concept that said we did have to have a little more specific use of symbols and text, we began working with colleagues at the San Joaquin County Office, along with WestEd,

01:09:16.716 --> 01:09:18.578
I may need help making this screen bigger.

01:09:19.679 --> 01:09:20.059
Someone.

01:09:23.802 --> 01:09:24.283
Here we go.

01:09:25.203 --> 01:09:28.847
So again, many disclaimers.

01:09:32.810 --> 01:09:36.593
If somebody from technology can help me make the screen bigger, that'd be great.

01:09:38.235 --> 01:09:38.535
Anyone?

01:09:46.277 --> 01:09:48.018
Thank you.

01:09:50.180 --> 01:10:00.608
So San Joaquin County Office and WestEd in working with the department staff and state board staff began to say this concept again of a web-based tool was still a little vague.

01:10:01.448 --> 01:10:04.571
So this is really a complete mock-up

01:10:05.251 --> 01:10:09.998
The real one may not look exactly like this, probably will not.

01:10:10.879 --> 01:10:19.010
We wanted to have some advice from the technology folks on the team to really help us think about this in a more detailed way.

01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:21.153
So here's the notion

01:10:22.013 --> 01:10:33.124
of how in this prototype the web-based system might be easily accessible, clear, and informative to multiple audiences, and I'll come back around on those categories.

01:10:33.664 --> 01:10:37.808
So here's a sample kind of landing page.

01:10:37.968 --> 01:10:44.174
Obviously, this was just an attempt to put together some of the key information.

01:10:44.875 --> 01:10:57.973
So, these three boxes, for example, that, again, there would need to be some additional text information and directions for people to how to get to a navigatable site, which will come in the development.

01:10:58.534 --> 01:11:00.597
But here are categories of the rubrics.

01:11:01.238 --> 01:11:09.743
The LCAP eTemplate, once it becomes online, and for purposes for now, the SARK, obviously, as part of a tool that is in place.

01:11:11.244 --> 01:11:18.228
The idea that the technology folks are building this so it can be easily searchable.

01:11:20.249 --> 01:11:22.711
that it can also be accessed on a phone.

01:11:23.272 --> 01:11:30.197
So, for those of us that don't have as much of the technical expertise, we learned that you build from the smallest device up, right?

01:11:30.277 --> 01:11:49.052
So, in order to have a system that's easily accessible on multiple devices, it has to work on the phone, which is, for example, much more about arrows that go down the page as opposed to across, because there's not as much space, obviously, on certain kinds of technology.

01:11:49.592 --> 01:11:58.041
So as a pretend LCFF rubric model, as my grandsons might say, is this pretend or is this real, Gramps?

01:11:58.081 --> 01:11:58.801
This is pretend.

01:11:59.502 --> 01:12:01.244
But the concept is here.

01:12:01.784 --> 01:12:04.126
So for example, if I click on the rubrics,

01:12:04.827 --> 01:12:13.612
I would get then to a similar kind of page that we see in lots of data that would take me to all of the districts in the state.

01:12:14.252 --> 01:12:18.194
We're going to be using the West Chavez Unified School District.

01:12:18.274 --> 01:12:24.698
I click on that and this takes me to this idea of a top level display.

01:12:25.718 --> 01:12:34.788
And a reminder that for now, we are using pie-shaped or fruit slice-shaped icons.

01:12:35.249 --> 01:12:36.971
We're just using the colors.

01:12:37.571 --> 01:12:46.341
This obviously may not stay in this format, but this is to help us kind of get the picture of, as Eric Crane, our colleague from WestEd, said at the July meeting,

01:12:46.962 --> 01:12:48.925
To see Peg right, the goal is to get to green.

01:12:49.606 --> 01:12:59.582
It's excellent if our schools and districts and student groups are performing in a category that is blue or green because that demonstrates a high level of success.

01:13:00.771 --> 01:13:06.614
The idea is that there could be some tabs across the top for more detailed reports.

01:13:07.255 --> 01:13:09.556
Again, this is a more simplified version.

01:13:10.076 --> 01:13:12.798
So we have the state indicators.

01:13:13.398 --> 01:13:19.641
This, for purposes of this prototype, this is the number of all student groups.

01:13:19.681 --> 01:13:23.683
And again, someone will say, some of this data doesn't make sense, Nancy.

01:13:23.803 --> 01:13:24.144
Correct.

01:13:24.984 --> 01:13:26.405
It's probably good it doesn't make sense.

01:13:26.425 --> 01:13:27.806
So people recognize this as a

01:13:28.746 --> 01:13:39.550
prototype mock-up that still has a lot of developmental work to do, but our sense is, as you've also indicated, how might this really work, is that we're getting much closer.

01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:49.974
So these are all student groups that are here identified in the state, and the state has

01:13:50.951 --> 01:13:56.994
Local performance indicators, remember, are just at the district level because it's the met, not met.

01:13:57.054 --> 01:13:59.176
We just put the rating in there for now.

01:13:59.236 --> 01:14:00.757
This would need to be clarified.

01:14:01.217 --> 01:14:12.123
The other thing that we've been talking about with our colleagues in San Joaquin is there could be some rollover boxes that I might rollover on this and it will tell me what all student groups mean.

01:14:12.203 --> 01:14:13.904
That's the number of subgroups.

01:14:14.384 --> 01:14:16.426
It could tell me what the blue color means.

01:14:17.266 --> 01:14:22.130
It could go into more detail about what does it mean to be red or orange.

01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:30.196
And of course, this piece is among the student groups in this state indicator.

01:14:30.896 --> 01:14:33.597
Two groups are in the red-orange category, right?

01:14:33.637 --> 01:14:37.959
This is the quick look at, oh, I've got to do some more detailed work.

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:47.804
Clearly, if I look at math assessment without having a lot more information, it may say to me, gosh, we've got some issues going on with mathematics very clearly.

01:14:48.304 --> 01:14:51.646
On the other hand, a suspension rate doesn't look too bad.

01:14:51.666 --> 01:14:54.467
I could always probe for more details.

01:14:55.167 --> 01:15:04.611
So the importance, remember, in getting to the ratings is the work that you have in the folders from the department around status.

01:15:05.072 --> 01:15:11.915
How are we doing in reaching standards met, for example, in assessment or exceeded?

01:15:12.395 --> 01:15:19.118
And are we increasing, for example, the number of student groups who are continuing to improve over time?

01:15:20.531 --> 01:15:28.154
If I click on English Language Arts, I get to, again, different ways that I might organize the reports.

01:15:28.734 --> 01:15:35.597
There will be text, of course, that explain this report provides the color-coded rating for a single indicator.

01:15:36.237 --> 01:15:41.959
So we took English Language Arts, and this shows me for West Chavez Unified.

01:15:42.639 --> 01:15:48.702
Among all of my student groups, this is the quick rating

01:15:49.762 --> 01:16:03.623
along with the Statements of Model Practices for English Language Arts that might trigger some more of our self-reflection and conversation at the district and school levels, and then there would be

01:16:04.913 --> 01:16:08.294
some links to external resources.

01:16:08.314 --> 01:16:16.458
A very important piece for the board, obviously, the ELA-ELD framework with specified chapters that might be of much more interest.

01:16:17.578 --> 01:16:22.520
There could be some information, obviously, about the task performance.

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:25.901
That link would take us to the department's website.

01:16:26.402 --> 01:16:29.363
So the hope would be that in a few clicks,

01:16:29.963 --> 01:16:36.748
there's quite a range of information that I could get to, whether I'm a parent or whether I'm a superintendent.

01:16:37.948 --> 01:16:45.794
As I look at the tab here, if I want to see, well, of all those subgroups, let's see who's doing well in our district.

01:16:46.414 --> 01:17:06.586
And that takes me to the rating colors that are the student groups who are doing well, blue and green levels, meaning they have a high status of performance on the English Language Arts Assessment, and they're continuing to increase over time, right?

01:17:06.966 --> 01:17:07.987
So that reminder

01:17:08.827 --> 01:17:14.591
with the lookup charts you have in the packet, that's how we get to that color coding.

01:17:15.071 --> 01:17:21.475
It's that look at the status and change dimensions across the indicators.

01:17:22.056 --> 01:17:27.059
If I want to see on the other hand, well, where are we still needing some assistance?

01:17:27.559 --> 01:17:36.025
I can very quickly see that for this district and these obviously are numbers of 30 or more students to be able to generate the data.

01:17:36.545 --> 01:17:44.070
We get to a look that says, hmm, we have a lot of work to do as a district when we want to probe a little more deeply.

01:17:44.531 --> 01:17:49.814
We could begin looking at our assessment results in literacy and English language arts.

01:17:49.934 --> 01:17:52.456
Is it specific to particular grade levels?

01:17:52.916 --> 01:18:15.073
So again, in a very short amount of time, as a district team, as a parent advisory group, there are some ways that we begin to say, in addition to what we're finding at the local level, there needs to be some additional work that may lead to some changed actions and services in our LCAP related to meeting the needs of our student groups.

01:18:16.397 --> 01:18:36.890
And again, lastly, as a mock-up prototype that could be developed over time, if I click on English Learners, this then takes me to my group of students who are English Learners, and I get a quick look at how they are doing across

01:18:37.871 --> 01:18:45.077
all of the state indicators related to whether there's progress or change going on.

01:18:45.517 --> 01:18:53.364
We see that there are some good things here that we can feel good about in the context of what's happening for this particular group of students in our district.

01:18:53.744 --> 01:18:58.768
We still have some work to do, for example, around obviously the college and career readiness.

01:18:59.369 --> 01:19:01.270
So while this is not

01:19:02.231 --> 01:19:09.634
The real web-based user interface, it's much closer than the Excel spreadsheet version of July.

01:19:10.214 --> 01:19:14.536
We know there's some consternation that things do seem to be changing.

01:19:14.656 --> 01:19:15.696
Yes, that is correct.

01:19:16.016 --> 01:19:20.298
Change is a good thing in the development of a web-based user system.

01:19:21.139 --> 01:19:37.379
and the opportunity to, again, with your thinking and decisions today, the further refinement and development of the web-based system with the expectation that our colleagues in San Joaquin would have

01:19:38.059 --> 01:20:06.898
The data populated by the end of November of 2016 for this year, our colleagues at the California Collaborative are very anxiously awaiting some models that are close to real because they're planning the training across the state for the use of the rubrics and the use for strengths and weaknesses analysis for helping districts this year in phase one really trying these out in a way

01:20:07.438 --> 01:20:17.309
so that by January, February, if the data is available the end of November for districts to review and provide feedback.

01:20:17.349 --> 01:20:27.940
We know there's not a lot of time between the end of November and January, given the school schedules, but ultimately there will be some data issues that probably need to be resolved

01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:51.877
so that by January it could become a working public system whereby districts and their stakeholders could also use this data as they begin analyzing where they're doing well, where they may need to look again within the context of their annual updates and their LCAP revisions for the 17-18 year.

01:20:52.818 --> 01:20:55.080
So on that note, I'll take

01:20:56.567 --> 01:20:58.169
Clarifying questions, that's.

01:20:58.229 --> 01:21:05.155
No, I think we're going to have our liaisons talk and then we'll have you back for if there are technical questions, clarifying questions.

01:21:06.437 --> 01:21:08.759
So, uh, member Burr, member Strauss.

01:21:10.646 --> 01:21:11.807
the whole presentation?

01:21:12.147 --> 01:21:12.427
Yes.

01:21:12.787 --> 01:21:13.608
Okay.

01:21:13.628 --> 01:21:15.649
I wasn't sure if Karen was going to speak or not.

01:21:16.949 --> 01:21:34.999
So a couple things I just want to reinforce, and since I get to be the first one out of the gate, my first comment is how deeply appreciative I am of all of the work that both the board staff, the department staff, superintendent, all of you have done over the last couple of years to get to this point.

01:21:35.599 --> 01:21:39.802
Because I sort of reflect back and go, wow, did we ever think this was going to happen?

01:21:40.662 --> 01:21:48.769
And also to just sort of reiterate a little bit about what Nancy said and to build on President Kirst's comments, this is a very complex system.

01:21:49.329 --> 01:22:01.859
We live in a very complex state that has 10,000 schools, over 1,000 school districts, about an equal number of charter schools, all of the subgroups that we're learning about, and so

01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:10.303
While it would be great if we could just produce one piece of paper and say, this is it, it's just not possible, and it's not possible in the world in which we live.

01:22:10.904 --> 01:22:19.287
But I do think that what we're going to be asked to vote on later today is really reflective of the kinds of things we've been talking about over the last couple of years.

01:22:19.887 --> 01:22:27.591
And probably most importantly, to again reinforce what President Kerr said, it makes operational a state law.

01:22:28.391 --> 01:22:31.012
which contains very specific priorities.

01:22:31.752 --> 01:22:48.695
If I were writing it today, I would probably want it to have fewer, because I do think that adds to the complexity, but nevertheless, it has eight for LEAs, it has 10 for County Offices of Education, and 22 metrics, and for 13 or 14 subgroups that we have to be responsible for.

01:22:49.316 --> 01:22:55.937
So given all of that, and given our responsibility to do that, I think we are in a really good shape to have that happen.

01:22:56.857 --> 01:23:06.459
I want to reinforce a couple of things, and we'll get to some of these in a lot more detail later on, but just what President Kirst said, this is intended to be an integrated system.

01:23:06.900 --> 01:23:10.560
Because if you think about three years ago, we didn't have a new federal law.

01:23:11.001 --> 01:23:17.822
The federal law was Carrick's Christmas gift, as I recall, when we got the reauthorization of NCLB.

01:23:18.342 --> 01:23:20.903
So now we add another complexity on top of it.

01:23:21.323 --> 01:23:27.447
But I just want to reinforce what we have said over and over again, that this will be an integrated system.

01:23:27.547 --> 01:23:29.208
There will not be two systems.

01:23:29.248 --> 01:23:31.630
There will not be a state system and a federal system.

01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:42.958
Some of our letter writers seem to confuse that, so I just want to make sure, and maybe we all want to say it out loud or in unison, but it will be an integrated system, and that's the important part.

01:23:43.778 --> 01:23:56.427
The one piece that I think is relatively new in our conversation, both in all of the written information that we got, and we heard a little bit about it today and we can talk about it more, is what I always called the so what question.

01:23:57.008 --> 01:24:05.914
Now we've defined all this stuff, we've set standards, we've figured out, you know, what we think LEAs should be trying to do, and then the question is, and what do you do if they don't?

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:07.556
what happens.

01:24:08.296 --> 01:24:13.962
And I just want to say at the outset that we take our responsibility at the state very seriously.

01:24:14.162 --> 01:24:19.807
We are the backstop for the children of California and that we will make sure that they don't fail.

01:24:20.528 --> 01:24:29.797
And the way we do that is through a differentiated set of technical assistance that is grounded in whether or not our subgroups are doing well.

01:24:30.317 --> 01:24:34.121
Again, I think some of our commenters sort of lost that piece of information.

01:24:34.701 --> 01:24:45.631
And it's laid out very clearly in the statute that, you know, if you, we start down beginning next year when we have all this information, if you fail in one or more subgroups, meaning you're not meeting the standards,

01:24:45.951 --> 01:24:47.192
then we start helping you.

01:24:47.733 --> 01:24:59.264
We start helping you at the county office level, which is our first line of defense and who are the agents of the state in doing coaching, linking you to peer networks, etc.

01:24:59.785 --> 01:25:07.232
We then go up to the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence, which will provide some more intensive assistance.

01:25:07.692 --> 01:25:09.173
and is working on that right now.

01:25:09.253 --> 01:25:21.599
And then ultimately, if you fail over a number of years and over a number of subgroups, Superintendent Torlakson is required to step in, come to us for approval with even greater intensive assistance.

01:25:22.099 --> 01:25:28.382
So I just wanted to kind of highlight that because I think it's the first time and there does again seem to be some confusion around that.

01:25:28.862 --> 01:25:34.745
I think we'll talk about that in greater detail later, but just want to call your attention to attachment four.

01:25:36.221 --> 01:25:38.183
because I think it really clearly lays it out.

01:25:38.643 --> 01:25:55.979
And for those of you who love to read statute as much as I do, education code 52072 is crystal clear about what the role of especially the superintendent and ultimately the state board as that backstop for the constitutional rights of all the children in our state.

01:25:55.999 --> 01:25:59.162
Okay, board member Strauss.

01:26:00.321 --> 01:26:05.867
I just would like to echo member Burr's thanks to the staff of CDE and State Board.

01:26:06.527 --> 01:26:07.728
We've come a long way.

01:26:07.809 --> 01:26:12.153
I think the reality is it's really complex and I think we know we're not there yet.

01:26:12.173 --> 01:26:21.822
I think each meeting we see subsequent progress and I also would like to say thank all the staff for the memos in between because it kind of helps you follow

01:26:22.422 --> 01:26:25.583
the threads of how all the pieces are coming together.

01:26:26.003 --> 01:26:39.245
And I think the reality from our analysis and from the presentation that Nancy made today and from the work is that we have a lot of placeholders of where we're starting from that we hope will develop over time.

01:26:39.265 --> 01:26:49.387
So I wanted to highlight technically some concerns I have and that is shared before public comments and then I think all of us will have some more comments afterwards.

01:26:50.087 --> 01:26:50.327
First,

01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:54.912
College and career indicator has been a lot of conversation.

01:26:54.952 --> 01:26:57.713
It's been a moving target as a former high school principal.

01:26:57.773 --> 01:27:02.756
We know that college and career is a complicated issue as kids get older.

01:27:02.776 --> 01:27:07.578
And it's far more than just A to G. It's far more than just tests.

01:27:07.678 --> 01:27:08.599
And I think we are

01:27:09.259 --> 01:27:13.463
clear about the need for developing the career technical area.

01:27:13.544 --> 01:27:15.566
We don't really have clear measures about that.

01:27:15.586 --> 01:27:19.890
There's been a huge investment on the state on our career pathway trust.

01:27:20.370 --> 01:27:23.654
So obviously lots more work needs to be done in that area.

01:27:23.734 --> 01:27:27.918
The other thing is there's been a lot of discussion about the four levels and are you really prepared

01:27:28.038 --> 01:27:29.619
Are you somewhat prepared?

01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:31.441
Are you not prepared at all?

01:27:31.581 --> 01:27:42.070
And we know that even students who graduate A to G and pass high school exit and have a decent score on EAP get to UC or CSU and have to do remedial courses.

01:27:42.130 --> 01:27:49.597
So we do know that even with that level that's currently in place in high schools, we find many students not fully ready when they enter high

01:27:50.317 --> 01:27:54.258
college and also that our independent colleges don't use those some of those measures.

01:27:54.318 --> 01:28:02.740
So I think with that there's been a lot of work and I appreciate what the technical design team's done to try to get us at a beginning level.

01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:07.261
I appreciate the transition from CST to Smarter Balanced.

01:28:07.321 --> 01:28:09.001
We now have a couple years of Smarter Balanced.

01:28:09.261 --> 01:28:14.262
CST is a more limited and less rigorous than some of the stuff we're doing now with our

01:28:15.022 --> 01:28:16.003
11th grade smarter balance.

01:28:16.263 --> 01:28:32.475
But I feel like the college and career is just at a beginning level and I want to make that really clear that that's what we feel all that it gives us a starting point but it will be developed over time from far more issues about numbers of APs, other course taking patterns and

01:28:33.175 --> 01:28:39.403
the whole idea of what does it mean to be really ready when you leave us at the end of high school.

01:28:39.463 --> 01:28:45.911
And so I have some clear concerns in that area and I look forward to continuing to have some feedback.

01:28:46.311 --> 01:28:50.016
I think we're going to get some more input each board meeting is my understanding.

01:28:51.778 --> 01:28:58.483
But where we are is really, I think, just a beginning level for looking at what we need to do over that.

01:28:58.963 --> 01:29:06.489
I think also there's an issue of readiness level with the standard three versus standard two on Smarter Balanced for 11th grade.

01:29:06.889 --> 01:29:11.613
We know that our Smarter Balanced score levels are much more rigorous than what we had before.

01:29:11.953 --> 01:29:15.996
And so that was established by a national process.

01:29:16.156 --> 01:29:18.698
But I think we have a lot more work to do in the college and career readiness.

01:29:18.718 --> 01:29:19.819
I just want to make that clear.

01:29:20.399 --> 01:29:29.409
Also on the English language learner indicator, I know there's going to be a work group that's going to be working on this and we'll be getting feedback and some recommendations to state board.

01:29:29.429 --> 01:29:36.256
I feel like we will always, I believe, have an English learner indicator, but it's going to develop over time.

01:29:36.356 --> 01:29:38.318
And I know we're going to be piloting our new test.

01:29:38.838 --> 01:29:47.588
But if that pilot test is effective, we could speed up some of the transition to modifying that ELI indicator.

01:29:47.608 --> 01:29:57.859
So I feel, and we'll probably talk a lot more about English Learner, but it's not where it needs to be, and I think that work group will have some big responsibility that CDE is convening to work on that.

01:29:58.499 --> 01:30:06.585
And then as a practitioner you've heard me ask about plan alignment and Nancy showed a little bit because she had SARC on there on her on her mock-up.

01:30:06.946 --> 01:30:11.970
But for local districts what we're trying to do is get this coordinated.

01:30:12.130 --> 01:30:15.773
So you're not doing all these separate plans but in fact it's aligned.

01:30:15.833 --> 01:30:18.315
So with your federal requirement with an LEA plan

01:30:18.795 --> 01:30:25.919
and your local LCAP and the CONAP that you do and the SARC that's required under legislation.

01:30:25.979 --> 01:30:30.461
And I know that Glenn there's been a CDE's been have a work group.

01:30:30.521 --> 01:30:32.082
I know it's very complicated.

01:30:32.102 --> 01:30:35.064
I know we're hoping to cross populate all that stuff.

01:30:35.364 --> 01:30:47.831
But I'd like in the comments to clarify and come back with us maybe in November about so where are we in moving to aligning where we can because clearly you heard Sue talk about the fact that we want this aligned.

01:30:48.671 --> 01:30:59.234
so that it's not just bureaucratic, but actually makes sense so that communities and staff can see, this is what we do in XYZ district that serve all kids, not in all separate compartments.

01:30:59.735 --> 01:31:02.135
So I think that's a really clear issue.

01:31:02.535 --> 01:31:06.597
The other thing we've not resolved, what does it mean for a broad course of study?

01:31:06.637 --> 01:31:08.517
ADG is not the only thing.

01:31:08.637 --> 01:31:12.058
First of all, broad course of study starts in elementary school, then it goes to middle school.

01:31:12.439 --> 01:31:16.860
In high school, you can measure it in a data system when you input courses in high school,

01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:22.664
but you ought to be able to tell an elementary here are some examples of what an effective broad course of study is.

01:31:22.684 --> 01:31:25.406
We don't want you just working on math and literacy.

01:31:25.446 --> 01:31:31.790
We want you working in arts and physical education and health and history and science and all the things that are important to you.

01:31:32.210 --> 01:31:46.580
So that work on priority seven about what are indicators of a broad course of study is not only a high school issue and it's not clearly defined and my hope is that our statement of model practice and I just want to thank Nancy for her comments that

01:31:47.603 --> 01:31:54.151
It's the most rubric-like, for those of us who live with rubrics, about how do you measure where you are against exemplars?

01:31:54.511 --> 01:32:00.337
So in a normal exemplar, you might have four levels, and are you approaching, where are you in the progress?

01:32:00.498 --> 01:32:06.665
And so as the statement of model practices comes in, I think that might be an area where we would say,

01:32:07.205 --> 01:32:12.630
This is what exemplars are for a broad course of study in elementary school and middle school.

01:32:12.970 --> 01:32:17.714
It's certainly our commitment to well develop broadly our next generation.

01:32:18.214 --> 01:32:20.136
Certainly, I think that's what our priorities are.

01:32:20.376 --> 01:32:24.479
But I think the model practices are our best hope for really giving exemplars.

01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:33.887
And while it's voluntary, when you're doing a self-assessment about are you implementing things, those are where I think you get the exemplars to match to.

01:32:34.467 --> 01:32:42.973
And so I'm looking forward to some of those how, but I'd like CD to clarify at some point, like how are we going to develop these model practices?

01:32:43.494 --> 01:32:46.316
I know they're not done yet, but I think there's some draft forms.

01:32:46.356 --> 01:32:47.577
When are we going to see those?

01:32:48.037 --> 01:32:51.780
It is a part of the rubric of all, it's one of the components.

01:32:52.060 --> 01:33:12.554
and I think we know there's still a lot of work to do this year but I think both the plan alignment, where the model practices are, what the work groups are going to do with the broad course of study, with the parent engagement surveys, with the school climate, all those pieces still some of those have to be developed where to get us where we need to be.

01:33:13.094 --> 01:33:18.378
So I would like the CDE to help us understand where the work groups will fit in and

01:33:18.738 --> 01:33:23.383
So in November we're likely, I know we're going to deal with the LCAP template finalizing that.

01:33:23.403 --> 01:33:27.468
When do we think the EL learner, I think that's not even meeting till this fall.

01:33:27.808 --> 01:33:29.650
When does that group come together?

01:33:30.991 --> 01:33:33.674
Alternative education, which I know is an important piece.

01:33:33.694 --> 01:33:36.217
There's a work group starting on that, so I think we need an update.

01:33:36.477 --> 01:33:44.739
so that the board itself, as we interact with people and in our role as board members, know that where we are now and then how are all these technical pieces going to come together?

01:33:45.139 --> 01:33:52.721
And as we work with our public and our constituencies, we can share with people we are working toward a fully integrated program.

01:33:52.821 --> 01:33:54.422
So those are key areas.

01:33:54.462 --> 01:34:01.984
I think I am expecting we're going to hear some comments on those areas and then we could maybe develop and discuss those as a board following the public comments.

01:34:02.364 --> 01:34:02.664
Thank you.

01:34:04.274 --> 01:34:07.398
OK, board member clarifying technical issues.

01:34:07.559 --> 01:34:10.142
We want to hear the public testimony.

01:34:10.643 --> 01:34:11.424
Board member Rucker.

01:34:15.472 --> 01:34:32.438
Well, I do want to thank the staff for putting this work together because what we have here is I'm not comfortable with the idea that we still are not we're still just beginning because that's actually not quite accurate or to say that this is incomplete because that's actually not quite accurate either.

01:34:32.918 --> 01:34:41.101
This has been a very long multi-year conversation that has dominated the agenda of this board for a long time.

01:34:41.721 --> 01:34:51.387
But what we have today is something that we haven't had before, a mental model about how the rubric will look.

01:34:52.444 --> 01:34:59.590
and an idea about how the reporting or how the interface on reporting can operate.

01:34:59.630 --> 01:35:11.821
And I think that that was an important key step, because I read very carefully a lot of the feedback that we received from stakeholders and their letters, and the concerns really were more addressing this,

01:35:12.341 --> 01:35:24.449
Then the technical issues about what's in the statute concerning the 8 state priorities, the 22 specific metrics and how the information is going to be reported on the 13 subgroups.

01:35:24.489 --> 01:35:30.033
What they were really talking about was creating a model for what the reporting would look like.

01:35:30.553 --> 01:35:40.181
So technically, I think today, with what was presented by the staff, we've kind of opened that door on that conversation.

01:35:40.522 --> 01:35:42.563
And it doesn't mean we have started.

01:35:43.004 --> 01:35:44.825
It doesn't even mean it's incomplete.

01:35:45.186 --> 01:35:58.117
It means we have finally crafted something to present to the public that addresses the issue of the mental model, because we've still been thinking about and having conversations on multiple different ways about what this is supposed to look like.

01:35:58.817 --> 01:36:05.361
But this is more than a start because I agree with both what Board Member Burr said and what President Kerr said.

01:36:05.801 --> 01:36:16.788
Today what we're approving will implement the statute, will implement fully the intent of the statute, not as a beginning, not as an initial first step, not as some incomplete process.

01:36:17.148 --> 01:36:23.052
I want to make very clear we are implementing the statute by the action we may take today.

01:36:23.852 --> 01:36:32.590
The other thing, though, is in implementing the statute, whoever said getting there is half the fun never tried to construct a new accountability system.

01:36:33.496 --> 01:36:36.998
because what we're also doing is turning the page.

01:36:37.478 --> 01:36:57.288
We're going from what has been a very binary accountability system to what I have spent my entire career in education, even as a student, asking for, which was better information, and not just information about a test or a collection of tests, so that

01:36:57.788 --> 01:37:09.635
Multiple measures have become more than just multiple assessments, and we are creating a system, or at least the goal on these metrics is to create a system that tells us more about the schools.

01:37:09.696 --> 01:37:14.959
That's the technical piece that the conversation probably is going to have to continue with.

01:37:15.639 --> 01:37:25.388
So, when we look at what's going on with the LPAC or with the assessments that still have to be developed, the question is not whether or not they will be included in the system.

01:37:25.708 --> 01:37:26.989
That decision has been made.

01:37:27.049 --> 01:37:28.070
They will be included.

01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:43.423
The question is, what type of information will this new assessment that we haven't seen implemented yet, what type of information is our system asking this assessment to tell us, and then how will we use the data?

01:37:43.923 --> 01:37:52.570
That's very different from whether or not the rubric and the accountability system we will try to adopt today is developed.

01:37:52.590 --> 01:37:54.851
Because yes, the answer is yes, it's been developed.

01:37:55.211 --> 01:38:03.958
We still have to do the work to understand what these new metrics will mean and what the system is asking these metrics to tell us.

01:38:04.418 --> 01:38:10.486
about the performance of the students and therefore the performance of the schools and the programs they implement.

01:38:10.586 --> 01:38:17.634
That's a different type of accountability issue beyond what the statutory requirement is that we're asked of today.

01:38:17.714 --> 01:38:23.822
So, I want to make sure in taking this action that we're not conflating multiple types

01:38:24.362 --> 01:38:42.392
of policy conversations, that we are clearly taking the step to implement the statute today, but the conversation about then what this means, how we understand it, or how we interpret or review and analyze what this new system is going to report, that's very different.

01:38:42.692 --> 01:38:51.637
And yes, that may be a beginning conversation, but this completes and closes a circle on a very long and I think very broad

01:38:52.077 --> 01:38:57.405
very inclusive and very transparent process to complete the development of this system.

01:38:58.847 --> 01:39:00.469
Thank you, Board Member Ortiz-Lacon.

01:39:03.110 --> 01:39:03.430
Thank you.

01:39:03.671 --> 01:39:08.815
I have a lot of questions and comments, but I thought we were just going to focus on this particular tool.

01:39:09.235 --> 01:39:14.339
So I do want to thank everyone who has worked on this tool.

01:39:14.419 --> 01:39:19.363
I see a lot of promise in the use of this dashboard, and I'm very excited to see how it evolves.

01:39:20.003 --> 01:39:23.666
I did have a question, however, on the top-level display.

01:39:24.367 --> 01:39:27.789
I saw the words red and orange.

01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:30.591
not equity report.

01:39:31.311 --> 01:39:50.581
And though it has the same purpose, I want to see the words equity report because the word equity reminds us of our commitment and obligation to narrow achievement gaps for the students that are identified the subgroups in that column, which happen to be the same subgroups that are generating additional funding.

01:39:51.241 --> 01:39:53.163
So words matter.

01:39:53.403 --> 01:40:04.072
And the message of putting equity in that top level display is a message that I don't want to see lost, though we have the purpose, which is identifying those that are red and orange.

01:40:04.853 --> 01:40:05.013
So

01:40:06.414 --> 01:40:11.180
Is there, can you write the last right column that says red-orange, not equity report?

01:40:12.661 --> 01:40:13.803
Was there a reason behind that?

01:40:13.903 --> 01:40:22.092
No, again, these were an opportunity to kind of build on some graphics that seemed to hold promise.

01:40:23.373 --> 01:40:24.435
We had about

01:40:25.275 --> 01:40:27.016
a week to work on this with San Joaquin.

01:40:27.056 --> 01:40:37.861
So the details of the wording, all of that really still needs to be designed in a much more explicit way based on the feedback that we've gotten from the state board members.

01:40:37.941 --> 01:40:46.105
So there was, it was on some earlier ones and then in the translation and working with folks trying to say, okay, what if we put it this way?

01:40:46.185 --> 01:40:48.806
So there was no intent to leave that out.

01:40:48.866 --> 01:40:53.088
It was just a matter of could we get something put together that would be usable at the meeting?

01:40:53.399 --> 01:40:57.783
Okay, really good to know, because I definitely want to see those words, which are the words we also voted for.

01:40:58.744 --> 01:41:05.370
The other thing, or the yellow, so I appreciate that we have green and blue, and then we have orange and red.

01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:08.933
My concern has been what happens to the middle, which is the yellow.

01:41:09.013 --> 01:41:13.037
Those are not, those subgroups will not be targeted through technical assistance.

01:41:13.077 --> 01:41:16.300
We haven't seen anything that really shows how we're going to move those students.

01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:18.702
And we're also now excluding them from

01:41:19.262 --> 01:41:23.444
And I know it's obvious if you're not red or orange and you're not blue and green, you're yellow.

01:41:23.764 --> 01:41:34.168
But I think it just gives it that prominence that we can't forget the middle because these students, through our technical assistance plan or as the way I'm reading it, will not be reached.

01:41:34.248 --> 01:41:37.450
And so we want to make sure we're focusing on those yellow subgroups too.

01:41:38.411 --> 01:41:40.092
Absolutely, and good point.

01:41:40.452 --> 01:41:53.603
We did again the quick, let's do red, orange, blue, green for the purpose of here, but the assumption would be there would be ways to go in and look across all of the performance levels within a fully developed system.

01:41:57.546 --> 01:41:57.867
Okay.

01:42:00.324 --> 01:42:05.159
Are we going to have a more specific technical presentation, or is this the presentation?

01:42:05.179 --> 01:42:07.546
Because it depends on what I would – my comments.

01:42:08.558 --> 01:42:19.426
Well, this was to clarify and understand things, you know, and I thought, for example, what was on this report and what wasn't on as just a mock-up makes sense.

01:42:20.206 --> 01:42:24.029
But we did want to hear the public testimony and then have the broader discussion.

01:42:24.589 --> 01:42:27.631
So, you know, the idea was to have the public comment.

01:42:28.172 --> 01:42:33.195
So if you have clarifications as we just heard, that's fine.

01:42:35.359 --> 01:42:43.103
Okay, so, so far, really appreciate the comments of my fellow board members, Rucker and Burr and member Strauss.

01:42:45.204 --> 01:42:56.691
In setting the context for this, understanding that we have more technical work to do and how we populate, but it really, it is about the concept and it is groundbreaking in what we're doing.

01:42:56.771 --> 01:42:58.892
So, very, very pleased with all of this.

01:42:59.932 --> 01:43:11.800
form follows function, and I think we now see how it functions through the form, and then I think now the form will also tell us and inform us about how we can refine the function within it.

01:43:12.140 --> 01:43:15.662
So I am really, really pleased with all that we are working on.

01:43:16.983 --> 01:43:19.644
Same concerns around the college career piece.

01:43:19.804 --> 01:43:26.949
I want to make sure that we are going to be technically sound when we come out with specific school and LEA data.

01:43:27.569 --> 01:43:40.196
I really want to make sure that it's technically sound so that we are as valid and reliable in the information that we present to the public about our LEAs and schools as possible.

01:43:40.216 --> 01:43:43.237
Let's see.

01:43:43.317 --> 01:43:50.601
Some of it is very specific, detailed, technical, but also something that you had said, too, and I think that we want to

01:43:51.121 --> 01:43:57.551
think about down the road is getting to that blue, getting to that green and blue.

01:43:58.252 --> 01:44:04.022
Right now, the way that we have structured on the technical level, it is that we're doing school

01:44:06.474 --> 01:44:09.138
school to school or LEA to LEA comparison.

01:44:09.178 --> 01:44:12.563
So our cut points are based on kind of the spectrum of that.

01:44:13.024 --> 01:44:21.276
So we will, there will be some schools who may never be able to get to blue or green because we're putting them on a, on a range.

01:44:21.876 --> 01:44:27.118
So, at some point, I know we need to start somewhere with where we are technically.

01:44:27.438 --> 01:44:36.082
At some point, we may want to look at what is an absolute standard that we want all schools to reach and provide that support up to that standard.

01:44:36.502 --> 01:44:41.284
So, that's something that long-term to think about over the next year.

01:44:43.405 --> 01:44:44.708
I think that's what I have now.

01:44:44.828 --> 01:44:45.149
Thank you.

01:44:45.169 --> 01:44:53.546
Okay, just to clarify too, we'd be happy to answer more technical questions after the public comment if you have, and Carrick's team is prepared as well, so.

01:44:54.227 --> 01:44:54.989
State Superintendent.

01:44:55.697 --> 01:45:02.901
Just on a clarifying point, if you could go back to the slide on English learners, and just to walk us through what the numbers mean.

01:45:02.921 --> 01:45:12.146
There are columns with percents, status, percents of what, and then there's, of course, change based on some base level.

01:45:13.126 --> 01:45:20.390
So if you wouldn't mind walking us through what, and it's a little hard to see, but I can read the percentage numbers.

01:45:21.831 --> 01:45:22.611
Graduation rate's 84.4%.

01:45:25.498 --> 01:45:52.071
Right, so again, within the context of the methodology, right, we want to know, for example, in this student group of English learners, I'll take a look at the English Language Arts Assessment, for example, 30.2% of our English learners on their Smarter Balanced assessments are at or above standard.

01:45:53.251 --> 01:45:58.376
So the percentage does depend on which of the indicators we're looking at.

01:45:58.737 --> 01:46:00.659
Similarly in mathematics.

01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:07.863
For our English learner group, 19.4% of them are at or above standard.

01:46:09.044 --> 01:46:17.529
The change indicator, obviously because we're only in our second year of data, we don't have a way to measure yet.

01:46:17.809 --> 01:46:24.032
We're getting to that point where the change, remember, looks at three years of data by comparison.

01:46:24.472 --> 01:46:26.914
So I'll go to grad rates.

01:46:28.153 --> 01:46:45.212
84.4% of English learners in West Chavez are graduating, but notice in the change, that is a decrease in the percentage of students in the English learner group who are graduating.

01:46:45.692 --> 01:46:47.374
So while 84 may look

01:46:48.195 --> 01:46:53.060
Pretty good, the fact that that is a declining number compared to the last few years.

01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:54.061
Puts them into the yellow.

01:46:54.161 --> 01:46:57.644
Puts them into the yellow in a way that says, what's going on here?

01:46:57.704 --> 01:47:00.006
We as a district have to probe a little bit more.

01:47:00.126 --> 01:47:06.632
So that's the sort of design of the methodology around both status and change.

01:47:07.901 --> 01:47:17.225
I think that was helpful and also discussed the interface with the met or exceed standards with the smarter balance, so that helps.

01:47:17.305 --> 01:47:26.149
And the chart I had handed out earlier today, if you look at the different subgroups, English learners are at the very bottom of improvement, only 1%, not anywhere close to 5 for math.

01:47:30.031 --> 01:47:30.651
Keeps changing.

01:47:30.751 --> 01:47:31.712
It keeps changing.

01:47:31.752 --> 01:47:33.773
Yeah, you graduate out of that group.

01:47:33.833 --> 01:47:46.339
So we should not, we've had many discussions about clarifying that English learner report because it's the students as they become more frequent.

01:47:47.239 --> 01:47:53.903
fully competent in English, they move out of there, so you just have a pool that keeps rotating through.

01:47:53.983 --> 01:47:55.264
But it's an indicator.

01:47:55.384 --> 01:47:58.206
It's not a good overall measure of English learners.

01:47:58.906 --> 01:48:01.248
But it indicates an issue or a challenge there, I think.

01:48:02.185 --> 01:48:13.108
And in a fully developed system, as I mentioned, there could be rollovers here that I could put my cursor on here and a text will come up and tell me what this is, or what the color means in relationship.

01:48:13.168 --> 01:48:22.411
So again, in a way that we need a simple system that people can access, but there needs to be much more information about what they're seeing here.

01:48:22.811 --> 01:48:27.632
So that also would be a part of the fully developed system.

01:48:29.612 --> 01:48:31.796
Okay, do we have anybody else over here on this?

01:48:31.816 --> 01:48:33.759
Okay, board member Rucker.

01:48:34.355 --> 01:48:44.503
And then, as it relates directly to, specifically to the English Learner Report, because as President Kirst talked about, this is a group that doesn't remain static.

01:48:44.543 --> 01:48:49.607
I mean, if you're in the subgroup of African-American students, well, you're kind of stuck there.

01:48:50.068 --> 01:48:53.150
But with the English Learner Group, that is a static... In a good way.

01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:53.951
In a good way.

01:48:54.191 --> 01:48:55.252
Yes, in a very good way.

01:48:55.332 --> 01:48:56.113
I can witness that.

01:48:56.513 --> 01:48:58.434
But the issue on this is,

01:48:59.575 --> 01:49:16.819
Maybe we need to consider how to think about the English learner subgroup either as a cohort or that is defined as being a group that this data is about a group of students for a particular defined specified period of time because we know that this does change over time.

01:49:17.219 --> 01:49:20.240
This may be one of the subgroups that we have to figure out

01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:46.096
a technical way to treat or define differently for purposes of this reporting because based on this technical piece, this group may never see a change if the collection of students that we report on, we can't truly make year-to-year or over time or across time comparisons because we're not going to be talking about the same group of students

01:49:46.776 --> 01:49:54.019
over time or over their career as K-12 students as a cohort like we do with the whole graduation rate.

01:49:54.079 --> 01:49:54.960
Does that make sense?

01:49:55.240 --> 01:49:56.120
Makes perfect sense.

01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:59.341
Thank you, Carrick Ashley, Deputy Superintendent, CDE.

01:49:59.942 --> 01:50:07.125
So we'll have a lot to say about this tomorrow, item number one, when we will take a little time to look at those

01:50:07.925 --> 01:50:27.178
very encouraging test results from last year's Smarter Balanced results, but also talk a little bit about moving forward, how to better explain to the public and to everyone actually, especially this group of English learners, which does change unlike almost any other student group there.

01:50:29.079 --> 01:50:32.661
These students get reclassified and then they're out of the student group.

01:50:33.081 --> 01:50:35.443
So we'll talk a little bit more about that

01:50:35.903 --> 01:50:56.283
uh... tomorrow i think we have a deferral tomorrow on this issue if we could because we're gonna have a full conversation yeah yes yes yes any other board all right so before we take public comment i think the board will take a ten minute break and will uh... reconvene at ten twenty five

02:00:49.130 --> 02:00:53.393
Board will reconvene and we'll begin the public comment.

02:00:55.114 --> 02:00:57.135
If the audience would sit down, please.

02:01:02.535 --> 02:01:05.898
So we will reconvene and open up with a public comment.

02:01:06.619 --> 02:01:15.668
Before public comment, I wanted to clarify that the board has not decided to replace suspension with chronic absence.

02:01:15.748 --> 02:01:19.031
I meant to say that was an example of something we might consider.

02:01:19.532 --> 02:01:22.855
So I wanted to make that comment clear at this point.

02:01:22.955 --> 02:01:26.618
So we will go with suspension until further notice.

02:01:27.299 --> 02:01:34.472
So please have the board people in the comment people line up in the order they signed in.

02:01:34.918 --> 02:01:44.001
Okay, we have 116 speakers, seven of which are groups of people, which one minute for a single, three minutes for a group.

02:01:44.421 --> 02:01:45.842
I'm going to call the numbers.

02:01:45.902 --> 02:01:52.204
Remember, we've moved to the numbering system, so if numbers one through 16 would please line up.

02:01:52.324 --> 02:01:57.206
And it looks like Superintendent Mike Hanson is on the number one group.

02:02:12.698 --> 02:02:13.952
Okay, yes, thank you.

02:02:16.830 --> 02:02:17.130
Thank you.

02:02:18.371 --> 02:02:21.453
Good morning, President Kirsch, Superintendent Torlakson, and members of the State Board.

02:02:21.693 --> 02:02:23.134
Thank you for the opportunity to be here today.

02:02:23.194 --> 02:02:24.214
My name is Mike Hanson.

02:02:24.795 --> 02:02:30.879
I'm serving in my 12th year as the Superintendent of Fresno Unified School District, and I am president of the eight-member core districts.

02:02:31.779 --> 02:02:39.264
I am here today with my fellow core district board member, Jose Vanda, Superintendent of Sac City Unified, as well as core staff and research partners from PACE.

02:02:39.785 --> 02:02:45.349
We'd like to acknowledge the board's work to establish a coherent local, state, and federal accountability system.

02:02:46.589 --> 02:02:58.735
Together, over the next several minutes, we'd like to talk about and present the State and locally driven measures that the core districts are using currently to support our improvement efforts and to explain why core districts serve as a research pilot.

02:02:59.535 --> 02:03:12.942
We strongly believe that the experience and capacity within the eight core districts, Fresno, Garden Grove, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Oakland, Sacramento, San Francisco, and Santa Ana, can support the State Board with decision making on several indicators in the month ahead.

02:03:13.602 --> 02:03:20.626
We operate under a public dollar public good header, meaning anything we develop and all lessons go free to all throughout the state.

02:03:21.366 --> 02:03:29.410
I want to also take the opportunity to thank Board Member Rucker for her comments around trying to develop a more complete description of what goes on in schools.

02:03:29.810 --> 02:03:39.635
We do believe what we're doing with the core district's locally driven measures on growth, high school readiness, and social emotional learning and school climate help to provide a more complete picture of school performance

02:03:40.296 --> 02:03:42.039
and that should be counted in the new system.

02:03:42.701 --> 02:03:47.390
The work we're doing at Fresno Unified helps to highlight this point and I have a visual from the core districts to share with the board.

02:03:48.775 --> 02:03:58.060
In Fresno Unified, as in many districts across California, we're working incredibly hard to close and eliminate the disproportionality between all groups on all measures.

02:03:58.700 --> 02:04:08.885
Despite strong growth in test scores for all of our students in all groups and in all grade levels and on both math and ELA this past year, we still have a lot of work to do.

02:04:09.346 --> 02:04:12.607
For this reason, we're making achievement of these groups a priority.

02:04:13.488 --> 02:04:15.028
Even though we have a graduation rate now of 83.8,

02:04:16.749 --> 02:04:21.591
And our subgroup of African American and Hispanic are 82.1 and 82.3.

02:04:22.051 --> 02:04:26.953
That is nowhere near where we want to be as a district and as a core set of districts.

02:04:27.353 --> 02:04:34.156
In the core districts, we are also surveying all students to better understand their development of social emotional skills and how they are experiencing the culture.

02:04:35.276 --> 02:04:42.761
of their schools and how their students are, and we find this very illuminating, and it gives us better information so that we can attack disproportionality results.

02:04:43.341 --> 02:04:50.345
Using this data, our research partners at PACE have shown us that our African American students report a worse school culture climate than their peers.

02:04:50.806 --> 02:04:55.468
In other words, they feel less safe, they feel like they belong less, and they feel the rules are unfair.

02:04:55.869 --> 02:04:59.611
These gaps remain, and we must compare these students to their peers in their own schools.

02:05:00.351 --> 02:05:09.818
Similarly, we see that our Black and Hispanic students report lower social and emotional skills, which include growth mindset, self-efficacy, self-management, and social awareness.

02:05:10.358 --> 02:05:20.005
This data has pointed a flashlight on social and emotional learning in school culture and climate as a potential improvement area that may contribute to closing these gaps.

02:05:20.285 --> 02:05:28.291
We don't have all the answers yet, but we know this data is taking us to a better place in the core districts, and we look forward to pursuing this research pilot.

02:05:29.861 --> 02:05:30.201
Thank you.

02:05:34.842 --> 02:05:46.326
Good morning President Gerst and Superintendent Torlakson, members of the State Board, I especially want to acknowledge Olivia Sisson, the student board member who also happens to be a student at C.K.

02:05:46.346 --> 02:05:49.627
McClatchy and also part of Sacramento City Unified School District.

02:05:50.707 --> 02:05:55.450
My name is Jose Banda and I serve as superintendent for Sacramento City Unified School District.

02:05:56.110 --> 02:06:03.134
The core districts have been working collaboratively for six years to improve student outcomes and to bring innovative strategies to scale.

02:06:03.194 --> 02:06:04.975
We believe that our experiences

02:06:06.416 --> 02:06:17.119
locally can help inform the state's evolving accountability system, especially as it relates to academic growth, eighth-grade readiness, social-emotional skills, and school culture climate.

02:06:17.900 --> 02:06:23.101
As a research pilot, the core districts want the state to hold us accountable for all the state indicators.

02:06:23.421 --> 02:06:35.085
In addition, we are asking the state to count academic growth, eighth-grade readiness, social-emotional skills, and school climate for accountability, improvement, and research purposes in our districts.

02:06:36.005 --> 02:06:46.029
We believe that to support one coherent accountability and improvement system, these local driven measures must be reported at the school level and they must be used to identify schools for support and intervention.

02:06:46.670 --> 02:06:46.950
Thank you.

02:06:52.092 --> 02:06:52.952
Good morning members of the board.

02:06:52.992 --> 02:06:53.953
My name is Christopher Lund.

02:06:53.993 --> 02:06:56.334
I'm the assistant superintendent for Long Beach Unified.

02:06:57.874 --> 02:06:59.735
Long Beach prides itself on continuous improvement.

02:07:01.113 --> 02:07:06.015
And as of late, through the LCAP process and through CORE's accountability system, that has continued to evolve.

02:07:06.995 --> 02:07:12.438
CORE's unique accountability system has prompted an amazing evolution in our thinking around data.

02:07:13.218 --> 02:07:18.540
We have changed from monitoring school-wide attendance to examining chronic absenteeism rates.

02:07:19.300 --> 02:07:27.644
Our survey data no longer stands alone, but now connects key survey measures like growth mindset to achievement results.

02:07:28.968 --> 02:07:34.714
In addition to SBAC achievement, we now examine a unique measure of SBAC growth year-to-year.

02:07:35.855 --> 02:07:44.744
These new measures create a crucial sense of urgency, even at select high-achieving schools with less-than-average SBAC growth.

02:07:45.856 --> 02:07:52.900
In addition, these new measures shine a celebratory light on some of our low-achieving schools with exceptional SBAC growth.

02:07:53.781 --> 02:08:02.066
A state-approved pilot of CORE's accountability system creates this essential sense of urgency and a crucial means to celebrate the hard work of our teachers, students, and parents.

02:08:09.637 --> 02:08:12.658
Good morning, President Kirsh, Superintendent Torlakson, and members of the board.

02:08:13.079 --> 02:08:13.939
My name is Noah Bookman.

02:08:13.959 --> 02:08:16.140
I'm the Chief Accountability Officer for the Core Districts.

02:08:16.220 --> 02:08:17.240
It's great to be with you today.

02:08:17.900 --> 02:08:19.681
I also want to highlight our growth measure.

02:08:20.301 --> 02:08:29.865
Acknowledging that the state is working on a growth measure and plans to roll it out over time over the next three years, Core has actually already developed a growth measure.

02:08:30.205 --> 02:08:35.968
And what we want to offer through our research pilot is the opportunity for the state to learn from our experience around measuring growth.

02:08:37.219 --> 02:08:39.480
This is different than the way the LCAP looks at growth.

02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:42.301
It's not about looking at a school at two points in time.

02:08:42.701 --> 02:08:53.306
It's looking at students from point A to point B. We control for a series of really important factors like students' prior achievement, their socioeconomic status, disability status, and English learner status.

02:08:53.686 --> 02:08:56.107
And that really helps us isolate the impact of schools.

02:08:57.014 --> 02:09:15.552
The factors you put in your growth measure, those are policy decisions and we want to encourage the state board to see them as that and also to see the core district's use of this in a research pilot around accountability as an opportunity to learn from that experience for the state as the state works for the next several years to improve growth.

02:09:15.672 --> 02:09:15.932
Thank you.

02:09:19.687 --> 02:09:20.147
Good morning.

02:09:20.267 --> 02:09:20.927
I am Heather Huff.

02:09:20.967 --> 02:09:27.070
I'm the Executive Director of the Research Partnership between the Core Districts and Policy Analysis for California Education, or PACE.

02:09:27.510 --> 02:09:38.054
Today I'll be sharing a summary of findings from our recent report, Identity Crisis, which uses CORE's innovative measurement system to explore the identification of schools for support and improvement using a multiple measures framework.

02:09:38.494 --> 02:09:41.015
I've passed out for your reference a summary of our findings.

02:09:41.835 --> 02:09:49.920
First, we find that different academic indicators measure very different aspects of school performance, which makes the use of a summative score for ranking schools highly problematic.

02:09:50.441 --> 02:09:54.023
Across academic measures, most schools are high on some things and low on others.

02:09:54.544 --> 02:10:00.047
Less than 1% of schools are in the bottom 5% on every indicator, every academic indicator.

02:10:00.427 --> 02:10:04.670
If you combine these four measures into a summative score, it averages out this variation by definition.

02:10:04.810 --> 02:10:11.495
For this reason, a summative score fails to identify many schools that are very low on specific indicators, even if they're below average on others.

02:10:12.095 --> 02:10:19.641
We also show that the non-academic indicators measure different aspects of school performance than academic indicators, highlighting different aspects of school performance.

02:10:20.302 --> 02:10:29.069
As an alternative to a summative score, we provide examples of a tiered approach, which provides a transparent method for identifying schools that leverages full information on each indicator

02:10:29.589 --> 02:10:47.259
For example, the state could decide to identify only schools that have low academic outcomes and are not demonstrating growth, or of two schools with similar academic achievement, the state could choose to focus limited resources on a school with poor non-academic outcomes rather than a school with positive non-academic outcomes, since the latter may already be on a road to improvement.

02:10:47.799 --> 02:10:56.365
Finally, our analysis shows that the vast majority of schools will be identified for targeted support and improvement under current federal regulations, which has major implications for the state.

02:10:56.846 --> 02:11:05.772
Together, our analyses show that decisions about how to identify schools are highly sensitive to the specific definitions employed and that these technical decisions reflect value judgments.

02:11:06.312 --> 02:11:19.332
This and our future research will help us all understand the unintended consequences of specific policy choices, including the quantitative and qualitative study of how new measures are actually being used by educators in schools and districts across the state.

02:11:19.812 --> 02:11:20.093
Thank you.

02:11:25.796 --> 02:11:27.937
Good morning, President Kirst, Superintendent Torlakson.

02:11:28.958 --> 02:11:32.661
PACE has submitted a letter, which is in your packets, and I'm going to speak to that letter.

02:11:33.421 --> 02:11:39.645
For more than 30 years, PACE has been committed to supporting continuous improvement in the performance of California's education system.

02:11:39.685 --> 02:11:43.488
We're grateful to the board for their endorsement of that commitment.

02:11:44.268 --> 02:11:48.411
But a commitment to continuous improvement requires a commitment to learning.

02:11:49.011 --> 02:11:55.416
And that requires both the capacity to innovate and data that allow us to evaluate those innovations.

02:11:56.236 --> 02:12:03.603
And the research that Heather Huff has presented is one example of the kind of learning that is coming out of the CORE PACE partnership.

02:12:04.504 --> 02:12:11.991
But that partnership will be threatened unless the CORE's accountability system is allowed to continue.

02:12:12.812 --> 02:12:18.096
The research partnership, I think, is good for CORE, it's good for the state, it's good for all California students.

02:12:18.257 --> 02:12:18.757
Thank you very much.

02:12:22.096 --> 02:12:22.356
Thank you.

02:12:22.376 --> 02:12:24.057
Rick Miller, Executive Director of the Core Districts.

02:12:24.117 --> 02:12:28.318
And let me sum up our presentation as saying that we appreciate the work that's gone on.

02:12:28.378 --> 02:12:30.378
Actually, we're very impressed with the accountability model.

02:12:30.398 --> 02:12:33.199
We're hoping to build our work on top of the work the state has done.

02:12:33.719 --> 02:12:40.781
But to be very clear, under the current construct, we cannot continue to do our work because we would actually have two separate systems.

02:12:40.821 --> 02:12:43.802
So unless the local accountability models matters count,

02:12:44.522 --> 02:12:48.785
which is to say that when you identify schools from a state and federal perspective, it's what you're counting.

02:12:49.185 --> 02:12:52.847
It creates two systems for us locally that is deeply concerning to our districts.

02:12:53.227 --> 02:12:58.851
So as a result of our partnership, though, we have a unique data system that actually allows us to look across a million students.

02:12:59.531 --> 02:13:04.534
And we believe by doing this partnership together with you, we can do a national model of what continuous learning really looks like.

02:13:04.574 --> 02:13:06.836
So we have a state model of items.

02:13:07.196 --> 02:13:09.658
then you actually use CORE to learn more about different items.

02:13:09.678 --> 02:13:11.760
So we look at SEL, we test it, we find out.

02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:14.862
We see does it work as an accountability model or not.

02:13:15.042 --> 02:13:17.544
And we're then also with PACE researching.

02:13:17.564 --> 02:13:22.849
We're doing quantitative and qualitative research in the schools to say when you add these measures into accountability model, what happens?

02:13:23.329 --> 02:13:27.032
That is actually unique and we think it will help move the state and forward.

02:13:27.152 --> 02:13:27.693
Thank you very much.

02:13:28.053 --> 02:13:31.916
Will numbers 9 through 24 please make sure they're lined up.

02:13:33.533 --> 02:13:35.755
Hannah Melnick from the Learning Policy Institute.

02:13:36.036 --> 02:13:39.859
Thank you staff and board members for your work developing this accountability system.

02:13:39.980 --> 02:13:42.842
California truly stands out as a leader among states.

02:13:43.543 --> 02:13:54.894
We appreciate the developments laid out in the proposed timeline, including exploration of a high school readiness indicator, five-year graduation rates, and school climate surveys, including the ongoing use of suspension rates.

02:13:55.975 --> 02:13:59.156
We also appreciate the improvements made to the college and career indicator.

02:13:59.676 --> 02:14:02.876
We do have a few recommendations on how to make the system even stronger.

02:14:04.117 --> 02:14:10.298
First, we recommend the board use scale scores rather than percent proficient as a measure of academic performance.

02:14:11.198 --> 02:14:22.960
Second, when the well prepared category is added to the career and college indicator, we recommend that students completing both A to G and career technical education be considered well prepared.

02:14:24.106 --> 02:14:29.191
Finally, we encourage you to convene a group of stakeholders to develop the college and career indicator going forward.

02:14:29.471 --> 02:14:29.832
Thank you.

02:14:35.016 --> 02:14:40.742
I'm hoping 9 through 24 are lining up somewhere, preferably here.

02:14:40.762 --> 02:14:43.584
How about speakers 25 through 32?

02:14:43.624 --> 02:14:43.805
Anyone?

02:14:51.798 --> 02:14:52.699
Okay, go ahead.

02:14:52.999 --> 02:14:53.219
All right.

02:14:54.240 --> 02:14:56.381
Good morning, Sasha Horwitz with the Linked Learning Alliance.

02:14:56.781 --> 02:15:06.467
First, the Alliance greatly appreciates the continuous attention you have given to measuring college and career readiness going back to the PSAA, and we think that you have arrived at the right starting place with this indicator.

02:15:06.787 --> 02:15:16.193
While the Linked Learning Alliance preferred the initial CCI model with all four performance levels, given the lack of career data, we agree with the decision to delay the well-prepared level in the first year.

02:15:16.793 --> 02:15:20.876
Over the next several years, we'll remain committed to tracking the implementation of the CCI.

02:15:20.917 --> 02:15:28.703
We'll make every effort to ensure that the necessary data are available so the well-prepared performance level can be restored in 2017-18 as proposed.

02:15:29.203 --> 02:15:33.787
This includes developing our own data validation system for integrated college and career pathways.

02:15:34.267 --> 02:15:34.788
Is that one minute?

02:15:36.089 --> 02:15:36.289
All right.

02:15:37.029 --> 02:15:37.330
Time?

02:15:39.732 --> 02:15:40.092
However.

02:15:40.152 --> 02:15:40.372
Okay.

02:15:40.452 --> 02:15:41.433
Come forward, please.

02:15:45.455 --> 02:15:46.376
Please come forward.

02:15:46.396 --> 02:15:47.837
Please come forward and present.

02:15:50.620 --> 02:15:51.241
Good morning.

02:15:51.621 --> 02:15:55.005
Good morning President Kerr, Superintendent Torlakson, and members of the board.

02:15:55.345 --> 02:16:00.511
My name is Cynthia Glover Woods and I'm the chief academic officer for Riverside County Office of Education.

02:16:01.231 --> 02:16:03.694
My colleagues have deferred their time to me this morning.

02:16:05.166 --> 02:16:13.189
On behalf of the educational leaders of Riverside County and the over 425,000 students we serve, I offer our support of item number one.

02:16:13.910 --> 02:16:32.037
Soon you'll be taking action that represents a historic moment for California's public education system, recognizing that as educational practitioners and leaders, we impart the necessary knowledge and skills that our youth need to become successful adults who serve our economy and become tomorrow's leaders.

02:16:32.817 --> 02:16:50.542
We applaud your steadfast commitment to developing a meaningful multiple measures accountability system that more accurately reflects the totality of public education and implicitly supports local continuous improvement practices that should be the foundation of any accountability system.

02:16:50.943 --> 02:16:52.363
And for this, we do thank you.

02:16:53.123 --> 02:17:01.886
We firmly believe that the basic system architecture and its most fundamental components you will be approving today is the right first step in this journey.

02:17:02.646 --> 02:17:09.449
We appreciate your commitment to remaining open to refinements that will help to better serve our students, families, and communities.

02:17:09.869 --> 02:17:13.651
And it's in this spirit that we offer the following for your consideration.

02:17:14.571 --> 02:17:23.955
First, we affirm the staff recommendation for relating to the development of a distinct state indicator that meaningfully addresses state priority seven.

02:17:24.695 --> 02:17:31.638
A priority that at its core is intended to address impediments to equal educational access for all students.

02:17:32.438 --> 02:17:42.126
A distinct indicator that assesses how well we provide equal opportunities for academic success is a necessary and rich companion to student achievement measures.

02:17:43.127 --> 02:17:54.877
Second, we must emphasize that in order for the evaluation rubrics to be effective strategic planning instruments, their availability must align with the LCAP development processes and practices.

02:17:55.558 --> 02:18:00.642
We urge you to consider investments that will address the possibility of any misalignment.

02:18:02.290 --> 02:18:09.912
Lastly, we support the development and future inclusion of a high school readiness indicator as one way to address the dearth of early metrics.

02:18:10.452 --> 02:18:23.474
This indicator cannot only tell us who among our students needs additional support in order to graduate on time with the necessary skills, but it will enable us to leverage the totality of their high school years and provide meaningful support.

02:18:24.035 --> 02:18:30.116
For these reasons, we urge you to prioritize the development of this indicator as part of your immediate future workload.

02:18:30.956 --> 02:18:39.371
As always, we thank you for the opportunity to comment, but mostly we thank you for your courageous action that you'll soon be taking on behalf of our students.

02:18:39.772 --> 02:18:40.153
Thank you.

02:18:47.953 --> 02:18:51.615
Good morning, Sarah Botches with the California Association of School Business Officials.

02:18:51.995 --> 02:18:59.659
Thank you so much and to your staff for their hard work and efforts over the last three years to develop a multi-dimensional accountability system.

02:19:00.299 --> 02:19:17.388
We understand that this initial phase of the evaluation rubrics will be pre-populated by the state and our request is that LEAs be given sufficient time to review and familiarize with the new setup and the new tool in order to ensure successful adoption and integration into generating the changes

02:19:18.008 --> 02:19:19.848
strategies in their LCAP development.

02:19:20.469 --> 02:19:29.430
We continue to support the state board's process to complete the web-based system developed in a manner that will lead to closing the achievements gap for all our students.

02:19:30.030 --> 02:19:43.273
CASBO will continue to assist in the development of the standards for the local performance indicators and the data collection to ensure that the state creates a system that assists LEAs in assessing, analyzing, and modifying their LCAPs.

02:19:43.553 --> 02:19:43.873
Thank you.

02:19:48.769 --> 02:19:49.229
Good morning.

02:19:49.590 --> 02:19:51.751
My name is Rick Alanis, Jr.

02:19:52.872 --> 02:19:56.494
I am the youth pastor, young adult pastor of the church San Bernardino.

02:19:57.595 --> 02:20:01.617
I'm also a member of PICO California in the San Bernardino County or Inland Empire.

02:20:02.498 --> 02:20:06.060
PICO California has 19 federations across the state of California.

02:20:06.820 --> 02:20:09.342
We are multi-faith, multi-racial,

02:20:10.891 --> 02:20:19.898
organization that strives to develop local leadership in our congregations, schools, and communities to work for racial, social, and economic justice.

02:20:20.956 --> 02:20:35.264
Together we represent over 480 interfaith congregations and 450,000 families of diverse economic, racial, ethnic, and religious backgrounds rooted in our schools across the state of California.

02:20:35.844 --> 02:20:36.685
Thank you for your time.

02:20:36.725 --> 02:20:40.907
We're proud to represent the people of California here this morning.

02:20:42.828 --> 02:20:47.931
If numbers 41 through 56 would please line up in the lobby.

02:20:51.278 --> 02:20:52.941
My name is Carla Lizada Das.

02:20:53.261 --> 02:21:01.572
I am a student in the city of San Bernardino and a board member with ICUCPICO.

02:21:02.854 --> 02:21:05.337
PICO California would like to thank President Kirst

02:21:07.780 --> 02:21:13.148
the State Board of Education and board staff for your hard work and commitment to the students of California.

02:21:13.809 --> 02:21:20.558
We would also like to give special thanks to Board Member Bruce Holliday, Nicolasa Sandoval, and Eileen Strauss.

02:21:23.803 --> 02:21:36.816
PICO California led the largest voter volunteer engagement effort in support of the passage of Prop 30 in the state, turning out 67,000 voters to support the passage of Prop 30.

02:21:37.637 --> 02:21:45.204
Following its passage, PICO has participated in the effort to pass the local control funding formula.

02:21:45.845 --> 02:21:54.370
to ensure that LCFF achieves the goal of creating improved outcomes for low-income students, English language learners, and foster youth.

02:21:54.570 --> 02:22:04.857
As we speak, our federations are getting ready to launch our voter engagement work to pass Prop 55 to ensure we continue receiving LCF funding.

02:22:05.357 --> 02:22:13.982
Finally, we just ask you to include a menu of evidence-based measures around parent involvement in the LCFF rubric to be adopted by October 2016.

02:22:14.042 --> 02:22:14.282
Thank you.

02:22:21.943 --> 02:22:29.286
Hello, I'm Vernetta Woods, a mother of three and a PICO leader from Oakland, California.

02:22:30.247 --> 02:22:34.589
I'm the president of the city site council at Fremont High School.

02:22:35.649 --> 02:22:46.614
We want to thank the state board for listening to the students, parents, and advocates around the needs for multiple measures in the LCFF rubric.

02:22:48.200 --> 02:23:00.822
I'm part of a team of parents who've been looking at a gap analysis focused on chronic absences, suspensions, and in relations to AG completions.

02:23:01.842 --> 02:23:06.623
We saw that all the data was in the red.

02:23:07.783 --> 02:23:16.805
Last night, we organized a meeting with parents and principals to go over the data and brainstorm solutions.

02:23:17.881 --> 02:23:19.762
to support student success.

02:23:22.044 --> 02:23:22.344
Time.

02:23:29.188 --> 02:23:29.488
Time.

02:23:29.508 --> 02:23:36.313
Parents suggested doing so we can make home visits to demonstrate that we care about our children.

02:23:36.833 --> 02:23:42.256
Without multiple measures, we cannot create an effectiveness solution.

02:23:42.577 --> 02:23:42.937
Thank you.

02:23:47.040 --> 02:23:48.503
One minute of speaking time.

02:23:48.523 --> 02:23:52.711
Go ahead.

02:23:52.731 --> 02:23:55.818
This is a big group, and so they're each taking one minute.

02:23:55.838 --> 02:23:56.018
Is that?

02:23:56.038 --> 02:23:58.703
One minute for speakers.

02:23:58.723 --> 02:23:58.984
OK, go ahead.

02:24:00.339 --> 02:24:01.160
Good morning, State Board.

02:24:01.220 --> 02:24:08.504
My name is Carlos Sanchez-Mata and I am a senior at Arroyo Valley High School in the City of San Bernardino Unified School District.

02:24:09.145 --> 02:24:12.887
I've been involved with ICUC-PICO California for a year and a half.

02:24:13.808 --> 02:24:24.235
As a student, working together with parents and other school board members helps me feel like our education system is moving ahead towards the right direction.

02:24:24.975 --> 02:24:29.738
Since 2012, suspension rates have been reduced 50% in the course of four years.

02:24:30.759 --> 02:24:39.105
It is evident that when parents and students are involved to improve school climate, clear positive change happens.

02:24:41.306 --> 02:24:47.691
We ask you to include a menu of evidence-based measures around parent involvement

02:24:50.097 --> 02:24:55.121
LCFF rubric to be adopted by October 2016.

02:24:56.042 --> 02:24:56.363
Thank you.

02:25:01.007 --> 02:25:01.867
We need an interpreter.

02:25:20.049 --> 02:25:21.570
Excuse me, I'm about to destroy the room.

02:25:23.532 --> 02:25:23.972
Good morning.

02:25:27.375 --> 02:25:29.456
Good morning to all the supervisors.

02:25:34.440 --> 02:25:39.323
My name is Maria Tapia, and I am a mother and a volunteer with Oco Pico.

02:25:39.343 --> 02:25:42.446
I have four children that attend school in the District of Santa Ana, California.

02:25:47.076 --> 02:25:49.678
We parents do not feel that we are respected when we bring up needs of our children at school.

02:25:49.698 --> 02:25:53.021
We feel that we are not being listened to and that we are not welcome.

02:26:10.942 --> 02:26:14.909
And when we do speak up, we feel reprisals from the workers at the schools and our children do as well.

02:26:24.053 --> 02:26:33.657
I am coming here to specifically ask for the measures that are recommended by PICO to be adopted and be included in the plan, not only for training for the staff but also for the principals.

02:26:48.120 --> 02:26:53.625
We're asking that you include in that menu regarding the parents being volunteers in that LCSF rubric.

02:27:07.043 --> 02:27:13.766
And that this be adopted in, which is going to be adopted in October of 2016.

02:27:14.226 --> 02:27:21.209
And we as parents are asking for a center for parents where we will be listened to and that the things that we request are listened to as well.

02:27:21.229 --> 02:27:21.729
Thank you very much.

02:27:44.154 --> 02:27:44.595
Good morning.

02:27:45.175 --> 02:27:46.556
Thank you for listening to your parents.

02:27:48.016 --> 02:28:02.343
My name is Maria Rosa Guzman and I'm here to ask you to include a menu in evidence-based and measure around parent engagement for all parents K-12 in each school district.

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:16.390
in the local control accountability plan rubric to be adopted by October 2016 and get us a knowledge how to work the education system

02:28:17.588 --> 02:28:29.993
to work together to make a better decision for our students because not only School Site Council, DELAC PTA, SPAC has to make a decision for our students.

02:28:30.633 --> 02:28:35.916
Each district and school had to engage party to close the student achievement gap.

02:28:36.436 --> 02:28:36.956
Thank you so much.

02:28:44.980 --> 02:28:45.420
Good morning.

02:28:45.500 --> 02:28:46.561
My name is Gloria Rojas.

02:28:46.661 --> 02:28:49.282
I attend Royal Valley High School as a sophomore right now.

02:28:49.663 --> 02:28:53.625
I am currently a part of the UC PICO from San Bernardino.

02:28:54.005 --> 02:29:08.613
In June 2015, PICO California, the California State PTA, Families in Schools, the Parent Organization Network, the Parent Teacher Home Visit Program conveyed a statewide meeting that included 17 parents slash community organizations.

02:29:09.073 --> 02:29:23.640
The two districts engaged directly in schools and parent engagement metrics that the state could adopt and from which districts could choose from continuation assessments, accountabilities, and improvement.

02:29:23.920 --> 02:29:32.865
We ask you to include a menu of the evidence-based measures around parent involvement in the LCFF rubric to be adopted by November 2016.

02:29:39.261 --> 02:29:40.822
Hello, I'm Danielle Prince.

02:29:41.042 --> 02:29:43.985
I am a member of Sacramento ACT, which is part of Pico, California.

02:29:44.685 --> 02:30:00.158
As Pico, California, we continue to organize at the local and state level to close academic achievement gaps by supporting positive school climate and culture and well-being through engaging and powerful shared decision-making and collective action between parents, caregivers, students,

02:30:00.658 --> 02:30:02.039
community members, and educators.

02:30:02.600 --> 02:30:23.297
While we support the use of self-assessment tools, adopting locally developed self-assessment tools alone without including a menu of evidence-based measures will not ensure use of well-researched evidence-based data and will hinder the ability to compare experience across schools and districts that is needed to achieve continuous improvement.

02:30:23.977 --> 02:30:31.042
We ask you to include a menu of evidence-based measures around parent involvement in the LCFF rubric to be adopted by November 2016.

02:30:31.142 --> 02:30:31.382
Thank you.

02:30:37.110 --> 02:30:38.892
Good morning, Sergio Luna with PICO California.

02:30:39.912 --> 02:30:59.169
We believe that by adopting a menu of evidence-based measures from which schools and districts can choose from, along with an assessment test, as evidence for the standards that will provide the flexibility to schools and districts while maintaining high standards across the state with a focus on evidence-based practices, comparable data,

02:30:59.910 --> 02:31:15.157
that informs continuous improvement and accountability in schools and districts across the state and the ability to correlate parent involvement to indicators in all state priority areas to ensure that we are creating an integrated statewide system to support student success.

02:31:15.677 --> 02:31:28.764
We encourage the school, we encourage you members of the board to adopt the manual evidence-based rubrics that are going to be adopted in November 2016 that include parent engagement in school climate as key indicators as well.

02:31:28.924 --> 02:31:29.484
Thank you very much.

02:31:36.101 --> 02:31:37.462
Please come to the podium.

02:31:42.587 --> 02:31:47.172
President Kirst, Superintendent Torlakson, Board of Education, pleasure to be here today.

02:31:47.212 --> 02:31:48.073
It's good to be alive.

02:31:48.093 --> 02:31:50.715
My name is Wes Smith.

02:31:50.795 --> 02:31:57.041
I represent 18,000 educational leaders who want to thank you for your diligent work and that of the Department of Ed to develop a

02:31:57.822 --> 02:32:19.431
a system that looks at continuous improvement, that highlights equity, that avoids summary judgments that tell our parents, our teachers, and our students absolutely nothing of significance, that looks at a discrete set of indicators that allow us to identify specific needs and then identify targeted intensive interventions to meet those needs.

02:32:19.891 --> 02:32:20.691
Stay the course.

02:32:21.292 --> 02:32:26.514
AXA is here to support you with the legislature, with the governor, and with the federal

02:32:27.194 --> 02:32:34.339
Department of Education so that our plan can not only be realized in California but a model for students across America.

02:32:34.459 --> 02:32:34.800
Thank you.

02:32:36.421 --> 02:32:37.021
Good to see you, Wes.

02:32:42.074 --> 02:32:45.676
Good morning, President Kurz, Superintendent Torlakson, and members of the board.

02:32:46.137 --> 02:32:47.238
My name is Linda Kaminsky.

02:32:47.298 --> 02:32:50.380
I'm superintendent of the Azusa Unified School District in Southern California.

02:32:50.920 --> 02:32:54.322
I'm also the vice president for legislative action for AXA.

02:32:55.083 --> 02:32:58.485
And I had two distinct honors in my life.

02:32:58.625 --> 02:32:59.586
One was at Harvard.

02:32:59.626 --> 02:33:05.330
I actually did my dissertation on status and change as a measure of student achievement.

02:33:05.870 --> 02:33:08.111
So I had a long background in that statistically.

02:33:08.131 --> 02:33:11.694
And then when I returned from Harvard, I was appointed to the technical design group.

02:33:12.414 --> 02:33:13.676
as it developed the API.

02:33:14.957 --> 02:33:23.826
I'm here today, first of all, to thank you for the work that you're doing, the thoughtful work that's gone into this, the opportunity to vet some of this and get stakeholder input has really been very helpful.

02:33:24.486 --> 02:33:28.830
And I'm also here to talk to you about the upcoming academic indicator, particularly the growth aspects of it.

02:33:30.132 --> 02:33:36.658
If we are continuing to follow the Alberta model, there is a challenge that we will be facing and that hopefully we can overcome.

02:33:37.118 --> 02:33:45.306
I detailed that in a letter to you with some sample data that comes from statewide results to show how this plays out for us.

02:33:48.029 --> 02:33:51.191
We are rightly very proud of ourselves in California for the API.

02:33:51.572 --> 02:34:01.260
It was a beginning model of looking at growth, and it was not perfect, but it had certain advantages over the AYP under No Child Left Behind that we really prided ourselves on.

02:34:01.680 --> 02:34:10.788
The AYP was a model that just looked at did you cross the proficiency bar, are you proficient or not, and set unreasonable targets for growth over time.

02:34:11.648 --> 02:34:16.613
The model that is through Alberta, and if we adopt that model, will actually do the same thing.

02:34:16.673 --> 02:34:22.078
It will pick a proficiency bar called met or exceeded standards, and it will look at growth over time.

02:34:22.119 --> 02:34:32.429
Now, the growth targets are much more reasonable than No Child Left Behind, but the challenge in both of those models, in contrast to API, is that they only look at one point on the scale.

02:34:32.869 --> 02:34:34.531
That is, are you over or under the bar?

02:34:35.492 --> 02:34:38.575
API, however, actually looked at growth at all points on the scale.

02:34:39.116 --> 02:34:52.550
This is important, particularly when you are talking about student achievement, because our challenge in California is how do we move kids from the lowest level to the next highest level, to the next highest level, until they are meeting or exceeding the standards.

02:34:53.551 --> 02:34:56.534
But that is not part of that accountability model, the Alberta model.

02:34:57.135 --> 02:35:02.240
It is like No Child Left Behind, only looking at did you meet or exceed the standards.

02:35:02.320 --> 02:35:09.626
The letter that I sent you has a quick look at some of our statewide data, which shows two areas where we got a lot of growth last year.

02:35:10.207 --> 02:35:14.411
One is kids who already met the standard and moved up to exceed the standard.

02:35:15.663 --> 02:35:19.965
That's not captured in this kind of a model because they're already above the bar.

02:35:20.826 --> 02:35:29.690
Also not captured are all the kids at the very lowest level who moved up one notch, who are now nearly meeting the standard but still not meeting the standard.

02:35:30.031 --> 02:35:31.391
That also is not captured.

02:35:32.032 --> 02:35:42.217
And that bottom growth, that is really essential for knowing how we're doing and particularly for the CCEE and for districts and schools to know where do I focus my energies.

02:35:43.218 --> 02:35:43.698
And what we saw,

02:35:45.902 --> 02:35:48.026
I hope you read the letter and I'd be happy to help out in any way.

02:35:48.627 --> 02:35:48.868
Thank you.

02:35:55.425 --> 02:35:57.126
Good morning President Kirsten, members of the board.

02:35:57.186 --> 02:35:58.287
My name is Jason Nangle.

02:35:58.687 --> 02:36:04.830
I'm Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services for the Coachella Valley Unified School District where we serve 96% unduplicated students.

02:36:05.410 --> 02:36:09.412
I'm also here representing ACSA as President of the Curriculum, Instruction, and Accountability Council.

02:36:10.413 --> 02:36:16.336
We appreciate the board's continuing commitment to utilize multiple measures in communicating school and district success and serving the very needs of students.

02:36:16.936 --> 02:36:22.298
Districts are complex organizations, often managing hundreds of different programs in our ongoing efforts to meet all student needs.

02:36:22.939 --> 02:36:27.681
Schools cannot be defined by a summative index any more than a single number could define the individual students they serve.

02:36:28.481 --> 02:36:31.602
Measuring both status and change for each of the metrics is also much appreciated.

02:36:32.143 --> 02:36:37.485
Schools and districts serving high-need students would be sunk if they were evaluated on status alone.

02:36:38.125 --> 02:36:40.286
It is encouraging to see that growth is also recognized.

02:36:40.806 --> 02:36:47.850
Likewise, high achieving schools and districts should not rest on their laurels, but should be incentivized to continue adding value to the educational experience of the students they serve.

02:36:48.771 --> 02:37:01.158
The proposed matrices, such as this one here I'm holding up for the graduation rates, showing how schools and districts are doing in terms of status and change are fairly easy to comprehend and provide useful information to stakeholders.

02:37:01.858 --> 02:37:07.886
However, trying to distill all metrics down to the top level display runs the danger of decreasing clarity and transparency.

02:37:08.366 --> 02:37:15.675
We recommend that stakeholders be able to easily link to these matrices explaining the interplay of status and change resulting in a single color.

02:37:16.676 --> 02:37:21.758
This past year, my district increased our graduation rate to 83.6%, the highest we've ever achieved.

02:37:21.838 --> 02:37:25.199
This was a particular source of pride because it exceeded the state average of 82.3%.

02:37:26.919 --> 02:37:33.442
However, in looking at the matrix for graduation rates, it appears that median rates are set at 85 to 90%.

02:37:34.662 --> 02:37:40.144
So it seems counterintuitive that our graduation rate would be above average, yet still fall short of the median range.

02:37:40.725 --> 02:37:50.321
So, my colleagues and I would like to recommend that the median range be set at 80 to 85 percent, and the high range be set at 85 to 90 percent, and very high be set at 90 percent or above.

02:37:53.123 --> 02:37:58.605
My ex-colleagues also appreciate the thought the board has put into deciding where 11th grade CAS results should be placed in the multiple measures.

02:37:59.125 --> 02:38:04.326
It is our belief that these test results should be placed with the academic measure of high schools, not in the college career indicator.

02:38:04.946 --> 02:38:11.428
With that being said, we are pleased to see that these test results are not trumping all of the measures of college readiness, but are being considered as just one indicator.

02:38:12.008 --> 02:38:18.090
We also feel that the CCI is heavily weighted with college readiness indicators and does not place enough value on career readiness indicators.

02:38:18.870 --> 02:38:29.321
As the Board continues to seek and identify additional career readiness indicators, we would like to propose that for now, students would be considered prepared if they meet either a college-ready measure or a career-ready measure.

02:38:29.902 --> 02:38:35.667
The as-yet-undefined well-prepared status could be defined as students that meet both college-ready measures and career-ready measures.

02:38:36.448 --> 02:38:39.910
Finally, we understand there will be there may be adjustments made to the multiple measures in the future.

02:38:40.450 --> 02:38:49.295
We just ask that these be kept to a minimum to keep the work manageable for practitioners such as myself who want to focus on educating kids not working full-time as statisticians and plan writers.

02:38:49.755 --> 02:38:55.819
Okay, so accents school leaders across the state look forward to continued collaboration with the board to better serve our mutual students.

02:38:56.079 --> 02:38:56.319
Thank you.

02:39:04.332 --> 02:39:04.772
Good morning.

02:39:05.072 --> 02:39:12.594
I'm Dr. Laurel Ashlock, assistant superintendent from Central Unified School District and a member of the ACCCIA Council and CASCD board.

02:39:13.074 --> 02:39:15.634
I would like to address three elements outlined in the system.

02:39:16.234 --> 02:39:20.455
First, as mentioned earlier, the English learner progress measures are of concern.

02:39:20.835 --> 02:39:29.657
Research tells us language acquisition between particular levels may not be a year's growth for a year's instruction, and this reality should be accounted for within the system.

02:39:30.337 --> 02:39:37.443
Second, the proposed system appears to place emphasis on mastery of standards at a particular level, and we acknowledge the need for those mastery levels.

02:39:37.863 --> 02:39:41.946
But we would like for growth at the lower levels of achievement to be recognized as well.

02:39:42.386 --> 02:39:46.089
We do not want a repeat of a previous system in which growth was not recognized.

02:39:46.169 --> 02:39:54.836
A technical provider came in only to affirm that action's being taken and the growth was occurring, yet the school district and the schools were marked as not achieving.

02:39:55.476 --> 02:40:03.785
Third, we would like for the 11th grade SBAC to remain as an academic indicator and for the college career readiness indicator provide a more balanced reflection of readiness.

02:40:04.386 --> 02:40:10.513
Readiness begins at the earliest levels and is contingent upon a broad course of study addressing the needs of the whole child.

02:40:11.474 --> 02:40:11.734
Thank you.

02:40:17.535 --> 02:40:28.639
Superintendent Torlakson, President Kirsten Board, I am Terry Rufert and I am a superintendent from Tulare County and it's one of the small schools and I would like to talk to you about a few things.

02:40:28.879 --> 02:40:38.822
As Sue had asked some of our colleagues to look into how this would affect small schools, then I went out and kind of asked some questions of my colleagues.

02:40:39.182 --> 02:40:45.306
I am just a superintendent, but I have colleagues that are superintendents, principals, bus drivers, teachers, all in one.

02:40:45.426 --> 02:40:51.971
So I'm going to kind of touch on some of their issues and share some of their concerns, and I do appreciate you looking to that and asking us about that.

02:40:52.671 --> 02:40:56.874
One is that for small schools, one or two kids can affect

02:40:58.175 --> 02:41:03.182
the indicators where they're going to fall in that rubric either significantly positive or negative.

02:41:03.563 --> 02:41:12.976
So I would like you to keep that in mind and one of our suggestions is you look over a three-year period instead of one or two years because it can affect greatly some small schools.

02:41:13.476 --> 02:41:25.960
The other thing is that on the rubric itself and all the work that needs to be done, that we continue to remember that the focus is on implementation of the LCAP, not compliance.

02:41:26.500 --> 02:41:33.643
And so we wanna keep it as simple as we can and be able to have them be able to focus on not just small schools, but large schools also.

02:41:33.683 --> 02:41:38.564
But those are two of their concerns, is the capacity to be able to do all the things that may be asked.

02:41:39.045 --> 02:41:42.326
And as things change over time, how they're gonna implement those.

02:41:43.306 --> 02:41:48.030
including some of the small high schools with some of the career, college and career.

02:41:48.050 --> 02:41:53.934
And so we highly suggest focusing on that and part of college and career.

02:41:54.435 --> 02:42:06.824
The other thing is with the rubric itself, when we go out to all of our stakeholders and talk about it, our suggestion is that you, the front page, the very top sheet that they look at, that it gives a good picture of what that school, that district looks like.

02:42:06.864 --> 02:42:10.007
So they don't have to keep drilling down and drilling down and drilling down to find the information.

02:42:10.587 --> 02:42:14.129
It makes it look like we are being very transparent and not trying to hide anything.

02:42:14.549 --> 02:42:18.471
So the suggestion is to keep the colors simple, not do a third, half, fourth.

02:42:18.912 --> 02:42:24.735
Just keep the colors, have all the different subgroups on that top page with the colors.

02:42:25.075 --> 02:42:27.296
And then if people want more information, they can drill down.

02:42:27.336 --> 02:42:31.358
But that would give a very clear picture of what we're looking at.

02:42:31.478 --> 02:42:34.860
And I think it wouldn't only be good for small schools, but also for big schools.

02:42:35.320 --> 02:42:42.042
Just like we do at the LCAP, we have a one-page snapshot of what our LCAP is to share with everybody, so it's much easier.

02:42:42.202 --> 02:42:51.925
And I know for my school district and those around, it really does promote that we are being transparent because it's easier to read instead of trying to think that we are reading something else into it.

02:42:52.485 --> 02:42:54.125
I thank you for the work that you've done.

02:42:54.145 --> 02:42:57.546
I know it's not an easy task, and I know there's a lot of work that needs to go into it.

02:42:57.906 --> 02:43:00.847
So as we're subtracting and adding, and I'm glad that it's a living document,

02:43:01.249 --> 02:43:05.894
adding, subtracting, please keep that in mind, that give us some time to implement that.

02:43:05.914 --> 02:43:07.596
Okay, thank you very much.

02:43:14.042 --> 02:43:19.026
Good morning, Martha Zaragoza-Diaz, representing the California Association for Bilingual Education.

02:43:19.466 --> 02:43:22.968
When I first saw this chart, I was a bit alarmed, but now I understand.

02:43:23.208 --> 02:43:23.949
I understand it.

02:43:24.149 --> 02:43:37.639
So, the combining of the two cohorts, I think, is appropriate in measuring the English language proficiency, but would not recommend combining the cohorts to measure status or change for the other indicators, such as math or English language arts.

02:43:38.699 --> 02:43:57.592
My second comment is with respect to priority three, parent engagement, and priority six, school climate, in attachment three on page four, please require that translations be provided of the specified documents for parents because that's not specifically stated in those two priority areas.

02:43:58.033 --> 02:44:04.257
As you know, the lack of translations of documents has been the number one complaint of parents in trying to become meaningfully

02:44:05.117 --> 02:44:08.240
engaged and participate in the LCAP process.

02:44:08.580 --> 02:44:08.900
Thank you.

02:44:13.503 --> 02:44:15.165
Hello, my name is Glenn Kenyon.

02:44:15.625 --> 02:44:29.195
I am a math content specialist at San Francisco Unified, but I'm here today as a fellow of the English Learner Leadership and Legacy Institute, a project with California, California Together in collaboration with CABE.

02:44:29.915 --> 02:44:36.657
The Institute is developing a new generation of leaders to sustain the movement for educational equity and excellence for English learners.

02:44:37.317 --> 02:44:42.779
I support the development of an English learner proficiency metric that is a composite of several indicators.

02:44:43.379 --> 02:44:51.941
I want this composite to include English proficiency as well as reclassification rates for all EL students, including long-term English learners.

02:44:52.721 --> 02:44:57.823
Such a composite will paint a more accurate picture of how English learners are truly progressing over time.

02:44:58.923 --> 02:45:20.115
I recommend that the state utilize the CELT data from 2016-17 for the 17-18 year and then use the LPAC status data for the 2018-19 year and as board member Strauss noted this will ensure that the state board will include EL proficiency data for until the adoption of a fully revised metric.

02:45:20.175 --> 02:45:20.435
Thank you.

02:45:24.164 --> 02:45:38.693
Shelley Spiegel Coleman from Californians Together, and just like all of you who are teachers are proud of your students, I'm so proud of having one of our fellows here with us and over the next year we're hoping that you'll meet all 18 of our fellows who will be the next generation of English learner leaders and advocates.

02:45:39.393 --> 02:45:43.776
And so that took a part of my time, but I'm so proud of having these folks working with us.

02:45:44.732 --> 02:45:51.177
One, we'd like to echo what Board Member Ortiz talked about, about the labeling of the column on equity.

02:45:51.217 --> 02:45:52.378
We think that's essential.

02:45:52.799 --> 02:46:11.253
The other piece is that I know there's an issue on how we're going to look at the cohort of English learners across indicators, but we need to maintain the group of English learners without the redesignated students for certain indicators to not mask where they presently are in our system.

02:46:11.713 --> 02:46:31.960
And lastly, on the statement of model practices, I'm hoping, and we would love to work with you on it, that some of those statements of model practices are specific for the unduplicated students, because as shown by Nancy, if we look at some of the indicators, and they're orange, and then they're look at statements, they need to be specific to those groups.

02:46:32.020 --> 02:46:36.502
So we hope that those model practices will be specific, and we'd love to work with you on it.

02:46:36.642 --> 02:46:36.942
Thank you.

02:46:40.765 --> 02:46:44.948
Good morning, President Kirst, Superintendent Torlakson, and board members.

02:46:45.228 --> 02:46:50.172
My name is Mary Lee and I'm a parent advocate in the Los Angeles Unified School District.

02:46:50.472 --> 02:46:56.316
I'm here to speak to you on behalf of parents in regards to the parent engagement piece.

02:46:56.957 --> 02:47:07.965
As part of this new accountability system, the parent engagement standard should ensure parent involvement that's meaningful, relevant, and engaging.

02:47:08.405 --> 02:47:37.368
And what we find is that the Parent Involvement Indicator really needs, in order to do this, a menu of evidence-based measures that will give consistent, comparable data across the state so that we can hold accountable the districts across the state in terms of engaging parents adequately, and also to allow for the local level to be able to see the progress that they are making.

02:47:37.768 --> 02:47:43.312
So, we do urge you to include a menu of evidence-based measures for comparable data.

02:47:48.176 --> 02:47:48.456
Hello.

02:47:48.496 --> 02:47:49.657
My name is Sandy Mendoza.

02:47:49.677 --> 02:48:00.345
I'm with Families and Schools, and I wanted to congratulate you all because I think that the process that we've been working under has been very strenuous, sometimes strained.

02:48:00.706 --> 02:48:03.748
I know in the press it might have looked like that, but I think conflict

02:48:04.388 --> 02:48:08.391
is good because it puts the conversation out there in a transparent way.

02:48:08.471 --> 02:48:12.735
And it also involves multiple stakeholders, which I don't think we've seen in a long time.

02:48:13.095 --> 02:48:17.999
And because of this process that you've been promoting, I think we're starting to see that happen.

02:48:18.379 --> 02:48:23.823
Change is constant, and change is not going to eliminate what we're seeing today.

02:48:23.863 --> 02:48:27.166
So I hope that we're going to be good at doing this even further down the line.

02:48:27.466 --> 02:48:32.690
And I also want to thank, and I'm using this time to do this, but I think it's worth it to thank people like Dave and Nancy and all the others

02:48:33.090 --> 02:48:45.436
that have really worked hard to reach out to all of us, often taking a lot of time, being very, very patient to answer our questions, and then call back again and say, now, can you explain that again?

02:48:45.456 --> 02:48:46.777
Because we're still confused.

02:48:47.457 --> 02:48:48.517
Not that they didn't do a good job.

02:48:48.557 --> 02:48:50.618
It's just that it is a complex process.

02:48:50.979 --> 02:48:57.001
But I do want to say that we are supportive of the multidimensional metrics for parent engagement.

02:48:57.021 --> 02:48:59.643
We hope that you'll adopt that, because we want to see

02:49:00.623 --> 02:49:07.330
consistent indicators at the local level that parents and districts will refer to.

02:49:07.410 --> 02:49:16.659
And just one last thing that we hope that you'll put a parent voice on the on the work group on the school climate and engagement because I think we don't have a local parent voice on that group.

02:49:16.699 --> 02:49:17.320
Thank you so much.

02:49:17.540 --> 02:49:21.264
And again parents everywhere if you're here in the building say hello.

02:49:28.070 --> 02:49:32.051
Honorary members of the School Board of Education.

02:49:33.091 --> 02:49:38.932
My name is Maria Rosales, and I will try in English.

02:49:40.132 --> 02:49:53.675
Okay, my name is Maria Rosales, and I am a mother leader of three, and I represent a parent organization network, and we would like to thank you for your commitment

02:49:54.355 --> 02:50:07.417
to work with parent and student groups and civil rights advocates to ensure that parent involvement and the school climate are prioritized in a multiple measure system for the local contract formula.

02:50:08.098 --> 02:50:20.100
We know that the parent involvement is not an area where data has been collected systematically across the school and that there is wide variance of the practices used

02:50:20.800 --> 02:50:23.404
and their effectiveness and engaging parents.

02:50:23.964 --> 02:50:37.061
For this reason, we believe that providing a menu of evidence-based measures from which a district can choose is necessary to support them in tracking their progress moving forward.

02:50:37.882 --> 02:50:47.990
Adopting a menu of evidence-based measure from which districts can choose, also using our self-assessment is necessary.

02:50:48.370 --> 02:50:54.935
We look forward to continue to working with you to ensure that a strong measure of evidence are adopted in November.

02:50:56.176 --> 02:50:56.556
Thank you.

02:50:56.937 --> 02:51:02.701
Okay, we're going to take this last witness and then you come forward because you were the prior group and then we have Assemblywoman.

02:51:02.841 --> 02:51:04.502
She's speaking after this person.

02:51:04.602 --> 02:51:05.303
Yes, okay.

02:51:07.541 --> 02:51:16.743
Good morning, Dr. Kirst, members of the board, Superintendent Torlakson, my name is Barbara Dinko, I'm a school psychologist and I represent California Association of School Psychologists.

02:51:17.223 --> 02:51:35.828
California Association of School Psychologists wishes to thank the CDE for adding the California Healthy Kids Survey to the list of tools that LEAs may use to survey and guide improvements in important school climate factors that promote student resiliency and mitigate risk behaviors and that measure protective factors in school connectedness.

02:51:36.348 --> 02:51:43.771
We encourage the board to adopt performance standards that also reflect school and community input, in addition to the student data.

02:51:44.251 --> 02:51:56.556
In particular, we suggest California Healthy Kids Survey, two partner surveys, the California School Climate Survey that is completed by teachers and staff, and the California School Parents Survey.

02:51:57.077 --> 02:52:02.519
These factors are important to school psychologists in the context of school, home, and community environments.

02:52:02.899 --> 02:52:15.409
We are, as school psychologists, able to contribute to the development, selection, implementation, and evaluation of programs and services that lead to important outcomes related to students' social, emotional, and behavioral competence.

02:52:15.689 --> 02:52:16.029
Thank you.

02:52:16.329 --> 02:52:16.970
Thank you.

02:52:16.990 --> 02:52:22.174
Okay, I'd like to- We have Assemblymember Weber with us this morning, and she's going to speak next.

02:52:22.654 --> 02:52:26.298
Yes, Assemblyman, woman, Shirley Weber from San Diego.

02:52:26.438 --> 02:52:29.281
Thank you for coming and we look forward to hearing from you.

02:52:29.402 --> 02:52:29.942
My pleasure.

02:52:29.982 --> 02:52:34.167
Good morning, President Kerse and Superintendent Torlakson and board members.

02:52:35.008 --> 02:52:36.910
My name is Dr. Shirley Weber.

02:52:36.990 --> 02:52:40.033
I'm the Assemblywoman from the 79th District in San Diego.

02:52:41.535 --> 02:52:57.787
In 2013, I joined my colleagues of the California Legislative Black Caucus to work to pass the Local Control Funding Formula, LCFF, with the hope that local decision-making would provide a more comprehensive approach to improving student outcomes.

02:52:58.588 --> 02:53:06.133
Since then, I've been engaged to uphold the promise of that policy to boost student success, especially for our most vulnerable and disadvantaged students.

02:53:06.954 --> 02:53:13.039
The gravity of this is underscored by the state's recent release of the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium test.

02:53:13.580 --> 02:53:18.344
While overall student achievement has improved, urgent needs remain.

02:53:19.004 --> 02:53:27.171
Clearly the achievement gap remains stagnant, we're the second worst in the country according to the LAO, and in some cases is widening on the state's assessment test.

02:53:28.012 --> 02:53:39.761
But taking the assessment test taken this spring, despite the millions or billions, I should say, of dollars that the state has invested in supplemental and concentration funding to specifically target these students.

02:53:40.541 --> 02:53:47.367
In English language arts, fewer than half of Latino students and fewer than one in three African American students are meeting or exceeding standards.

02:53:47.887 --> 02:53:52.611
While in math, fewer than one in four African American and Latino students meet this benchmark.

02:53:53.351 --> 02:54:04.239
This isn't just about poverty, because overall in the state math test results, low-income white students are performing slightly better than non-low-income African-American students.

02:54:04.800 --> 02:54:10.024
There are schools and districts where students are doing well, where gaps are significantly narrowing or nonexistent.

02:54:10.564 --> 02:54:24.640
We need a comprehensive data dashboard to easily be able to compare data across schools and districts to identify their successes and then, through collaboration and support, help other schools and districts with similar types of progress.

02:54:25.501 --> 02:54:33.149
Implementing an effective accountability system is one of, if not the most important element to ensure that LCFF actually meets the needs of students.

02:54:33.590 --> 02:54:44.781
And some of you may remember that when we fought for LCFF, it was assured to us that there would be an effective accountability system, because simply returning monies to schools without an effective system would be dangerous.

02:54:45.811 --> 02:54:52.017
I have been gravely concerned about the direction of the state board in heading with respect to accountability.

02:54:52.338 --> 02:54:56.002
And for that reason, I authored this past year AB 2548.

02:54:56.562 --> 02:55:06.552
And that concern was carried forth through the legislature, which has unanimously, in bipartisan support, sent the bill AB 2548 to the governor's desk this last week.

02:55:07.353 --> 02:55:15.277
I appreciate the colossal task that this board has engaged in for over the last three years to implement LCFF, including the work to create a new accountability system.

02:55:15.798 --> 02:55:17.118
I know it has not been easy.

02:55:17.659 --> 02:55:28.405
I was especially pleased in May when the board member, with Mrs. Burr's motion, made a shift from a narrowly defined set of measures to a more holistic, multiple measure approach outlined in my bill.

02:55:29.185 --> 02:55:38.152
That said, I believe that the action you have before you today, again, needs a mid-course correction to get back on the right track of heading toward a single integrated accountability system.

02:55:38.972 --> 02:55:48.139
In the state's draft regulations, the board is being asked to adopt a framework for an accountability system that ignores key equity guardrails contained in ESSA.

02:55:48.680 --> 02:55:52.322
I see major deficiencies in these regulations in at least three major areas.

02:55:53.203 --> 02:55:55.145
One, how the standards are being set.

02:55:55.825 --> 02:55:59.089
Closing the gap in achievement should be the core of this system.

02:55:59.609 --> 02:56:06.557
The state board should set specific improvement standards that require greater improvement for students that are farthest behind.

02:56:06.937 --> 02:56:16.688
To continue to have the same goal for all students would obviously continue to keep those students or keep the gap growing and not help them catch up, which was the intent of LCFF.

02:56:17.714 --> 02:56:20.978
Two, that the academic indicators are elevated, how they're elevated.

02:56:21.479 --> 02:56:25.945
The legislature strongly supports multiple measures, which is one of the reasons I introduced 2548.

02:56:26.966 --> 02:56:33.995
The bill expanded the indicators far beyond those initially proposed by this board in January and March, and now mirrors the board's May action.

02:56:34.796 --> 02:56:38.177
even recognizing that some progress has occurred regarding multiple measures.

02:56:38.638 --> 02:56:47.041
I do believe that the accountability system needs to significantly focus on academic achievement, academic growth, and closing the achievement gap, which is found in AB 2548.

02:56:47.641 --> 02:56:54.444
It is critical that we highlight access to opportunities and provide proper school environment that will help students thrive.

02:56:55.024 --> 02:57:03.928
At the same time, we cannot lose sight of the fact that it is the knowledge and skills students develop that will set the trajectory for their lives once they leave school and transition into society.

02:57:04.728 --> 02:57:13.730
If a school is not succeeding in at least one academic measure for all of its subgroups, the school should be identified for support and assistance.

02:57:14.710 --> 02:57:25.613
By no means should this be a shame, punish, and takeover strategy that was sometimes recommended in No Child Left Behind, but rather the constructive technical assistance we all envision in moving forward LCFF.

02:57:26.333 --> 02:57:30.214
The third thing is how schools and districts are meaningfully differentiated.

02:57:30.934 --> 02:57:43.119
Using multiple measures is the right way to go in our accountability system, but at the end of the day, the taxpayers, parents, and policymakers have a right to know when schools and districts are fundamentally struggling and ensure something is being done about it.

02:57:43.760 --> 02:57:48.162
Achieving this doesn't have to be reduced to a single number, but it does have to be crystal clear.

02:57:49.062 --> 02:58:17.540
I know that it will be discussed more when the state adopts its ESSA plan, but for now, it is critical for the board to ensure that the multiple measures it includes in the online evaluation rubric actually are transparent and accessible, including allowing for easy comparison across schools, districts, and subgroups, and have a click-through access to greater data details, as AB 2548 calls for, and not just a simple summary report of two or how a school is doing.

02:58:18.140 --> 02:58:23.566
Without these critical adjustments, it appears that the board will place California on a path of two disjointed systems.

02:58:24.146 --> 02:58:30.293
A state system that demonstrates little regards for federal law, as well as one that will need to meet the federal statutory requirements.

02:58:30.773 --> 02:58:35.778
This bifurcation will likely confuse district administrators, educators, and the public.

02:58:36.579 --> 02:58:42.662
The governor's legacy of LCFF education reform and the success they promised for our students is very much at stake here.

02:58:43.162 --> 02:58:57.970
The state board must reconcile the differences between state and federal accountability requirements and align them into one cohesive and straightforward system so that locals can implement it consistently and effectively to support educational improvement so that the public knows what to expect.

02:58:58.590 --> 02:59:03.874
We have achieved this by integrating the best of LCFF, but not by the wholesale disregard for federal law.

02:59:04.575 --> 02:59:11.941
As you know, AB 2548 has been sent to the governor, and as I pointed out, with bipartisan support and unanimous support in the Senate and the Assembly.

02:59:12.721 --> 02:59:19.607
And in addition to that support, over 350 organizations and groups have called for its signature.

02:59:20.007 --> 02:59:23.470
This includes business, civil rights, and community leaders across the state.

02:59:24.250 --> 02:59:34.035
Even when my local paper, the City Union Tribune, which is sometimes been seen as the conservative paper, says that Weber has done her job, now it's time for the governor to do his, which is to sign AB 2548.

02:59:34.676 --> 02:59:46.402
I hope the governor will sign this legislation and that simultaneously the board will make the necessary policy adjustments to integrate the key provisions that are outlined in the bill into California's new accountability system.

02:59:47.162 --> 02:59:49.145
Lastly, I want to thank Dr. Kurz.

02:59:49.485 --> 03:00:02.002
I want to understand what Dr. Kurz said earlier today, that is, the intent that suspension would only be used as an indicator for one year, and then the plan is to substitute it by including chronic absences.

03:00:02.643 --> 03:00:12.731
AB 2548 and the legislature has weighed in our desire to specifically include chronic absences, which is a student engagement measure, and school climate, which includes suspensions.

03:00:13.211 --> 03:00:19.356
We would be very troubled, the legislature would, for any efforts to remove suspensions in the future from the reporting.

03:00:19.756 --> 03:00:24.540
That becomes important in terms of determining the climate of a school and how well students are being received.

03:00:26.662 --> 03:00:30.105
Thank you this morning for allowing me to make these comments and words to you.

03:00:30.345 --> 03:00:32.367
AB 2548 is on the governor's desk.

03:00:32.767 --> 03:00:35.550
We are lobbying very hard and so are the organizations to have it passed.

03:00:35.951 --> 03:00:40.735
I want this board to understand that it does align with many of your goals and objectives in terms of what you want to do.

03:00:41.176 --> 03:00:42.417
It gives a structure and focus.

03:00:42.717 --> 03:00:49.644
The legislature is very serious about the fact that they wanted to weigh in on it to provide the kind of guidance for the state board and the work that you're doing.

03:00:50.304 --> 03:01:03.270
We hope once it is signed that we will be able to work together to make sure that we have a system that is one system, that is transparent, that really gives us the information we need to help schools to be successful for our children.

03:01:03.651 --> 03:01:05.932
So once again, thank you for the opportunity to address you today.

03:01:06.372 --> 03:01:06.652
Take care.

03:01:18.795 --> 03:01:21.756
Thank you very much, Superintendent and Board, for your time.

03:01:21.776 --> 03:01:23.917
I realize how busy the day is.

03:01:24.417 --> 03:01:25.898
Hello, I'm Deacon John Wilson.

03:01:25.958 --> 03:01:29.099
I'm the Education and Enrichment Director for West Angeles Church.

03:01:29.959 --> 03:01:38.762
We run a community-based program for education of students from kindergarten all the way through college.

03:01:38.802 --> 03:01:46.325
We're doing some intervention and doing things with over 700 lower and middle class families in Los Angeles and surrounding areas.

03:01:47.641 --> 03:02:02.385
This means everything from helping parents with student issues of even selecting preschools and kindergartens and schools, all the way up to providing affordable college alternatives to eliminate these high loans and things students have.

03:02:03.165 --> 03:02:12.427
Each year, over 100 families with over 220 children, I might add that this year we're way ahead of this pace, and I think you'll see the reason why in my comments.

03:02:12.987 --> 03:02:15.128
Each year, over 100 families with over 220 children

03:02:17.208 --> 03:02:19.350
ask us for advice on how to pick schools.

03:02:20.090 --> 03:02:40.825
Previously, we've used a combination of factors, but mainly the API score, which is no longer available to us, and we realize that you're carefully considering what other information will be available in the area of school choice, and it's very essential that you actually do that, as was referenced by the Assemblywoman.

03:02:41.525 --> 03:02:45.608
Yes, the API system was limited, but it was the only way for us to think about

03:02:46.041 --> 03:02:47.322
how to help our parents.

03:02:48.002 --> 03:03:00.108
However, we are now here to ask that you approve a new system that will provide families that have varying educational needs, a way of deciding which school is best for their students.

03:03:00.868 --> 03:03:11.393
This is an issue of family educational values that as a responsible community educational leader, I can't really ignore that.

03:03:11.852 --> 03:03:14.933
when they come and they're trying to find alternatives for their youth.

03:03:15.673 --> 03:03:23.694
This is a request that will help to improve the performance of students in those targeted, underserved areas that you mentioned earlier today.

03:03:24.034 --> 03:03:25.534
And we see them all in the inner city.

03:03:25.574 --> 03:03:32.116
I know we focused today on two groups, but there are probably four different groups of students that we're deeply concerned about.

03:03:33.136 --> 03:03:39.017
So I wanna really thank you for your time and considering this free choice of school issue, that's very, very important to us.

03:03:55.071 --> 03:03:56.411
Good morning members of the board.

03:03:56.751 --> 03:03:59.852
My name is Jose Godinez, father of three.

03:03:59.872 --> 03:04:02.073
My daughter is in UC Davis.

03:04:02.093 --> 03:04:05.514
My second child is in high school and the youngest is in elementary.

03:04:22.921 --> 03:04:24.842
We're here with families that have traveled over 10 hours.

03:04:25.662 --> 03:04:34.106
Personally, I took this day off so I could be here with you because we are interested in education.

03:04:41.989 --> 03:04:44.731
We support the multiple measures that you are taking.

03:04:49.833 --> 03:04:54.616
So that we have a rubric to identify the conditions of each school.

03:04:54.636 --> 03:05:02.180
But this colored rubric gives us a confusing, a slightly confusing idea

03:05:10.902 --> 03:05:18.709
We would like to see this rubric as an indicator for families to know exactly what is the status of the school.

03:05:36.504 --> 03:05:51.667
And this would allow parents like me to become more involved in the education of our children and to know that we can give them a good education.

03:05:52.327 --> 03:05:57.008
California has the opportunity of witnessing this change thanks to you.

03:06:03.345 --> 03:06:09.389
We are convinced that you will take the steps necessary and you will give the due importance to our request.

03:06:20.601 --> 03:06:24.544
I want to underscore that we want to see this rubric as a system of added grading.

03:06:24.624 --> 03:06:25.044
Thank you.

03:06:55.299 --> 03:06:56.940
Good morning members of the board.

03:06:57.660 --> 03:07:03.985
My name is Karina Payne and I'm a mother of two boys in the Los Angeles Watts area.

03:07:04.785 --> 03:07:14.792
Both of my sons have their own individual challenges when it comes to learning and I've had to be actively involved with their schools to get the support that they need.

03:07:16.193 --> 03:07:19.896
So when I heard that there was a meeting to discuss school accountability

03:07:21.047 --> 03:07:27.772
I had to come and represent for my family, other families in my community that share my same perspective.

03:07:30.574 --> 03:07:40.861
As parents, we're thankful that you're including multi-measure, I mean, excuse me, we're glad that you're including measures to evaluate school quality.

03:07:41.621 --> 03:07:49.567
As I prepare to explore different school options for middle school for my son, I'm going to look at the college readiness

03:07:50.655 --> 03:07:55.917
indicator and focus on how strong the English and math preparation is at that school.

03:07:56.937 --> 03:08:04.859
Parents like us want to also see an overall rating because it gives us a different perspective of the school.

03:08:05.620 --> 03:08:09.081
We need and deserve to have access to clear information.

03:08:09.661 --> 03:08:18.704
So please consider giving us both a multi-measured dashboard and an overall rating that we can make the best choices for our kids.

03:08:19.204 --> 03:08:19.544
Thank you.

03:08:35.390 --> 03:08:36.911
Good morning, members of the board.

03:08:37.391 --> 03:08:42.955
My name is Alexandra Menjivar-Shamberger, and I have two kids currently at Wadsworth Elementary School in South LA.

03:08:43.836 --> 03:08:50.080
I have taken an overnight bus to come here today with my kids because my main concern is the new dashboard.

03:08:50.581 --> 03:09:00.208
Multiple measures are good because it gives parents like me more information, but when I look at it, it doesn't tell me how my school is doing overall.

03:09:00.888 --> 03:09:04.451
what it's being proposed, it's not clear for us.

03:09:05.131 --> 03:09:13.878
This worries us because at Wadsworth, every year we graduate fifth graders and many of them are not ready for middle school.

03:09:14.458 --> 03:09:20.302
Parents like me want to work with teachers and staff to lift our school for our community.

03:09:20.863 --> 03:09:28.629
To make this happen, we need clear information because it's our main tool to ask questions, hold school accountable, and get parents involved.

03:09:29.309 --> 03:09:41.216
I am here today to ask the board to give us access to clear multiple measures and overall ratings and so that we can make the best decisions for our kids, our schools, and our communities.

03:09:41.716 --> 03:09:44.858
Parents need to know how schools are doing.

03:09:45.218 --> 03:09:45.999
Thank you very much.

03:09:57.846 --> 03:09:58.286
Good morning.

03:10:00.191 --> 03:10:01.772
My name is Dr. Carol Hedgepeth.

03:10:01.912 --> 03:10:05.213
I am the Director of Research and Policy at Innovate Public Schools.

03:10:05.834 --> 03:10:14.058
We believe every child deserves a world-class public education, and we work to empower parents, educators, and community leaders to make this a reality.

03:10:14.758 --> 03:10:22.762
I'm also the mother of three girls attending traditional district public schools, and I see some schools in my community that are doing very well, and others that aren't.

03:10:23.743 --> 03:10:26.264
As a parent, I think it's important to learn from what works,

03:10:27.004 --> 03:10:29.025
and to hold schools accountable when things aren't.

03:10:29.665 --> 03:10:38.610
In my experience, parents are moved to actively work to improve schools when we have clear and easy to understand data about how schools are doing.

03:10:39.330 --> 03:10:42.832
Providing such data is part of Innovate's mission, and so I'm here to help.

03:10:44.172 --> 03:10:52.960
The accountability measures that are being considered here are not clear, not accessible, and not aligned with strong accountability for academic outcomes.

03:10:53.580 --> 03:11:02.728
Even with my two advanced degrees and years of experience with data, I find it difficult to make sense of the draft reports and prototypes that I've seen, and I don't think that I'm alone.

03:11:03.829 --> 03:11:17.244
On behalf of Innovate and the thousands of voters that we work with, we ask that you opt for creating accountability tools that are clear and easy to use for parents and the community to advocate for high quality equitable education for all students.

03:11:17.905 --> 03:11:18.185
Thank you.

03:11:27.113 --> 03:11:27.633
Good morning.

03:11:27.933 --> 03:11:29.193
My name is Lori Ben.

03:11:30.214 --> 03:11:37.995
I am here representing my husband and I's seven children that have attended Pasadena Unified School District schools.

03:11:39.856 --> 03:11:55.679
I'm here to request and hope that you will oblige this request to allow us to have an overall summative report per school along with the multiple measure dashboard that is being proposed.

03:11:56.579 --> 03:12:01.522
With all of our seven children, you can imagine that they were in different grades at different times.

03:12:02.323 --> 03:12:08.206
And within the Pasadena Unified School District, you have high schools and then you have some schools that are elementary only.

03:12:09.287 --> 03:12:15.171
And so I have used, in the past, the overall summative report.

03:12:15.851 --> 03:12:16.372
However,

03:12:17.032 --> 03:12:28.417
I love that you're including the dashboard because now it gives me an opportunity to decide, you know, what the strengths are, what the weaknesses are within the schools.

03:12:29.978 --> 03:12:36.481
But I'm asking and petitioning that we include the overall summative rating system as well.

03:12:37.841 --> 03:12:43.764
It gives, it would give me an idea of what school I would like to look at or what schools I would like to look at at the top.

03:12:44.584 --> 03:12:45.685
And then with the

03:12:48.130 --> 03:13:00.242
With the dashboard, I can look at the different situations that are within the school that are listed in the dashboard to see what strengths might meet my family's needs and to see what weaknesses there are.

03:13:00.702 --> 03:13:03.685
Maybe my child is in one of the schools where there are weaknesses.

03:13:04.446 --> 03:13:11.573
And my husband and I have been great proponents of helping our schools with those weaknesses as much as we possibly can.

03:13:12.253 --> 03:13:14.194
And so I thank you for your consideration.

03:13:14.614 --> 03:13:31.339
I would also like to add that we have over 500 parents, students, and community members that have signed petitions in support of inclusion of the overall summative into the dashboard.

03:13:31.739 --> 03:13:32.559
Thank you for your time.

03:13:46.570 --> 03:13:48.712
Buenos dias miembros de la mesa directiva.

03:13:49.833 --> 03:13:51.535
Mi nombre es Angelita Godinez.

03:13:51.995 --> 03:13:54.017
Good morning members of the board.

03:13:54.077 --> 03:13:55.639
My name is Angelita Godinez.

03:13:56.159 --> 03:14:00.003
Y vengo de parte de la red de empoderamiento de padres.

03:14:00.423 --> 03:14:04.267
And I am here on behalf of the network of empowering parents.

03:14:05.068 --> 03:14:08.231
Representando a las familias del valle de San Fernando.

03:14:08.511 --> 03:14:11.314
In representation of the families of the San Fernando Valley.

03:14:16.658 --> 03:14:25.061
I took a day off from work because I care about the education of my children and that of my community.

03:14:25.081 --> 03:14:26.501
I am active.

03:14:26.521 --> 03:14:30.443
I'm an active parent in the committees for all the schools of my children.

03:14:36.343 --> 03:14:42.070
And I am here to fight for the improvement of the educational system for all children.

03:15:00.992 --> 03:15:11.336
We would like to see more and clearer measures and we need more information that is easy to understand for the parents.

03:15:11.556 --> 03:15:13.256
The current dashboard is confusing.

03:15:13.276 --> 03:15:18.118
I want to see a dashboard with multiple measurements that are clearer.

03:15:24.316 --> 03:15:32.562
and a summative grading system that allows me to evaluate and compare schools and as a parent make the best decision.

03:15:50.286 --> 03:15:56.187
Because I believe that our children deserve a high quality education with great expectations.

03:15:56.307 --> 03:15:56.867
Gracias.

03:15:57.007 --> 03:15:57.347
Thank you.

03:16:07.690 --> 03:16:08.390
Buenos dias.

03:16:08.630 --> 03:16:09.030
Good morning.

03:16:09.810 --> 03:16:11.071
My name is Fidelia Muralles.

03:16:13.752 --> 03:16:15.973
I have come in from Los Angeles in South Central.

03:16:16.394 --> 03:16:18.035
I have a son in sixth grade.

03:16:18.195 --> 03:16:20.416
Thank you for all the work you're doing.

03:16:20.476 --> 03:16:23.759
But we would like a clear and specific dashboard for each parent.

03:16:41.440 --> 03:16:49.702
something that we can all understand and that possibly has been itemized for each school so that we as parents can make the best decisions for our children.

03:16:49.742 --> 03:16:50.583
We left LA by bus yesterday.

03:16:50.603 --> 03:16:54.424
We left our jobs because we are very interested in the education of our children.

03:17:15.878 --> 03:17:27.308
And those who could not make it have sent their signatures, over 500 of them, requesting a clear measuring tool that all parents can read.

03:17:28.049 --> 03:17:34.054
We're interested in our children's education and that's why we are here.

03:17:35.195 --> 03:17:35.756
Thank you very much.

03:17:43.567 --> 03:17:45.728
Hello, my name is Brenda Contreras.

03:17:46.208 --> 03:17:50.850
I'm a third year student at Sacramento State University, and I'm also a member of Students for Education Reform.

03:17:51.970 --> 03:17:59.993
I graduated from Richmond High School, one of the lowest performing school districts from the WCCUSD school district, one of the lowest performing districts in California.

03:18:01.033 --> 03:18:06.775
And I'm here to speak on the California School Accountability System and Multiple Measure Dashboard proposal.

03:18:07.436 --> 03:18:11.157
This proposal is too complex for regular citizens and family members to understand.

03:18:12.771 --> 03:18:23.255
And although multiple indicator system is more likely to help in identifying where the problems lay, it is not better than a single indicator if it's just numbers and colored boxes.

03:18:24.516 --> 03:18:32.159
Thus making it harder to close the achievement gap and holding our schools accountable for serving every student in California with a fair and quality education.

03:18:32.699 --> 03:18:41.743
Please stand with students and families and consider a clearer school rating system that includes an overall assessment of school quality in addition to the currently proposed multiple measure.

03:18:41.883 --> 03:18:42.183
Thank you.

03:18:47.025 --> 03:18:50.046
Hello, good morning members of the State Board.

03:18:50.767 --> 03:18:55.689
My name is Raquel Antolin and I am the California Program Coordinator for Students for Education Reform.

03:18:57.010 --> 03:19:04.633
I'm also an alumni of the West Contra Costa Unified School District and a recent graduate from Sacramento State University.

03:19:07.279 --> 03:19:17.601
At SFER and we believe that every child deserves and should receive a quality K through 12 education regardless of their background and socioeconomic status.

03:19:19.182 --> 03:19:28.404
We also believe that every parent has a choice and a powerful voice which the system needs to listen to and comprehend.

03:19:30.379 --> 03:19:39.901
I come from a failing district and due to great support from programs and resources I was able to navigate that broken system and make it into higher education.

03:19:40.922 --> 03:19:44.782
But many of our students do not have that privilege and or support.

03:19:45.963 --> 03:19:49.464
Therefore they deserve to be provided.

03:19:49.484 --> 03:19:54.345
And after seeing such a current proposed system I was shocked.

03:19:57.125 --> 03:19:59.226
So please listen to us.

03:19:59.566 --> 03:19:59.826
Thank you.

03:20:01.474 --> 03:20:04.916
If number 64 through 80 could please line up.

03:20:08.457 --> 03:20:10.758
Good morning members of the state board.

03:20:11.298 --> 03:20:15.180
My name is Daniela Ramirez and I am part of Students for Education Forum.

03:20:15.860 --> 03:20:23.504
I am an alumni from West Contra Costa Unified School District and I am now currently attending UC Davis as my second year.

03:20:24.304 --> 03:20:30.911
I am a dedicated advocate to better our schools and our education system in my community and California as a whole.

03:20:31.792 --> 03:20:38.799
I was fortunate to attend Leadership Public High School in Richmond, which is known to be a top school in California.

03:20:39.519 --> 03:20:43.583
However, when I graduated from high school, I rekindled my friendships with

03:20:44.364 --> 03:20:58.609
past friends who did not have the ability to go to LPS, instead they went to Richmond High, which is a traditional public school in my community, and I realized that they did not have the same opportunities that I did.

03:20:59.650 --> 03:21:01.650
They didn't have the same supports or resources.

03:21:02.191 --> 03:21:06.352
Most of my friends didn't even know how to apply to college and had no guidance.

03:21:08.573 --> 03:21:09.393
on how to do it.

03:21:09.653 --> 03:21:15.715
Some friends told me that they tried applying to college on their own and calling universities for hours.

03:21:17.696 --> 03:21:22.358
Please, I urge you to set up.

03:21:22.758 --> 03:21:28.520
We need transparency in our parents and students and teachers deserve a summative multiple measure.

03:21:35.694 --> 03:21:36.214
Good morning.

03:21:36.614 --> 03:21:40.476
I'm Sung Bae with the Stanford Center for Opportunity Policy and Education.

03:21:41.037 --> 03:21:49.421
We commend the board and the CDE for your hard work on developing a college and career readiness indicator and engaging diverse sets of voices and perspectives in this effort.

03:21:49.881 --> 03:22:03.208
We also appreciate the board and CDE's commitment to continually improve the CCI over time, and in particular, to develop more robust measures of career readiness, which could include indicators that demonstrate authentic performances

03:22:04.448 --> 03:22:19.056
such as completing a portfolio or capstone project or participating in a career technical student organization competition, as well as indicators of authentic experiences such as internships, work-based learning, and service learning experiences.

03:22:19.597 --> 03:22:24.619
Finally, we urge the board to convene a working group to further develop these career measures.

03:22:24.820 --> 03:22:25.540
Thank you for your time.

03:22:33.766 --> 03:22:34.227
Good morning.

03:22:34.547 --> 03:22:41.697
My name is Joy Wake and I'm joined by my colleagues representing the San Juan Unified School District High School Parent Engagement Group.

03:22:42.458 --> 03:22:48.305
First of all, thank you for recognizing the need for parents to have a usable and understandable way to compare schools.

03:22:48.886 --> 03:22:58.972
While the dashboard is impressive because it gives more data, we ask that you also provide something that is simpler for parents to use and clearly measures student success overall.

03:22:59.653 --> 03:23:03.975
Please provide a summary rating that compiles and compares three things.

03:23:04.696 --> 03:23:06.877
One, demonstrated student success.

03:23:07.398 --> 03:23:10.159
Two, opportunities for student success.

03:23:10.580 --> 03:23:13.121
And three, support for student success.

03:23:13.481 --> 03:23:14.242
Thank you very much.

03:23:23.843 --> 03:23:27.624
If we could make sure that number 64 through 80 are lined up.

03:23:27.764 --> 03:23:28.104
Thank you.

03:23:28.124 --> 03:23:32.525
Hi, I'm Celia Jaffe from California State PTA.

03:23:33.165 --> 03:23:38.906
I'm speaking specifically today about the removal of 11th grade assessments from the academic indicator.

03:23:39.966 --> 03:23:51.769
Perhaps in the focus on a robust construction of the college career indicator, people did not fully explore the ramifications of removing 11th grade standardized assessments from the academic indicator.

03:23:52.649 --> 03:24:10.708
If this stays in place, high schools and districts that are high school only will have no objective standard measure of student academic performance because graduation requirements vary by school district, EL reclassifications and other metrics don't apply to all students in that grade.

03:24:11.889 --> 03:24:31.903
This high-quality, smarter, balanced assessment that we've made so much of will be taken by an entire 11th grade, but the only bearing the results will have on the school's accountability report will be as a kind of met, not met thing for the portion of students who don't qualify by other measures as college or career ready.

03:24:32.403 --> 03:24:35.586
Please make use of the assessment results in the academic indicator.

03:24:35.746 --> 03:24:35.986
Thank you.

03:24:40.916 --> 03:24:43.257
Good morning, Patty Scripter, California State PTA.

03:24:44.077 --> 03:24:48.439
Appreciate the work done to date and want to comment on some of the things that were said this morning.

03:24:49.080 --> 03:24:53.962
We appreciate Dr. Kirst's comment on the need and commitment to a broader base of information for accountability.

03:24:53.982 --> 03:25:03.786
For Member Burr, who talked about the so what, if we're doing more than operationalizing a statute, the so what is what matters to parents for accountability, so we appreciate that recognition.

03:25:04.566 --> 03:25:15.976
We always appreciate member Ortiz-Rincon keeping that equity up there, and especially member Strauss for recognizing that a broad course of study is more than talking about high school.

03:25:17.137 --> 03:25:23.883
Commitment to access to a full curriculum is core to what PTA believes the arts are critical for students, so we really appreciate that recognition.

03:25:24.503 --> 03:25:29.086
And last, on the family engagement local indicator, met not met is not acceptable.

03:25:30.046 --> 03:25:36.190
Looking to see if a light switch are on or off doesn't tell us if the room's well lit, if it's poorly lit, or if the bulb is burned out.

03:25:36.250 --> 03:25:37.711
We need a better standard than that.

03:25:37.771 --> 03:25:39.172
We need more levels.

03:25:40.853 --> 03:25:50.939
It doesn't ask the districts to do real self-assessment and it doesn't meet the model of continuous improvement and a multidimensional assessment is called for in the statute.

03:25:51.179 --> 03:25:52.660
We look forward to working with you on that.

03:25:52.700 --> 03:25:52.980
Thank you.

03:25:57.998 --> 03:26:01.980
Good morning, I'm Estelle Lemieux with the California Teachers Association.

03:26:03.521 --> 03:26:19.932
On behalf of the California Teachers Association, I want to thank and commend the board, the department, and the staff for making such significant progress on this monumental project and for continuing to engage stakeholders throughout the process.

03:26:20.552 --> 03:26:44.027
While important work remains, the initial evaluation rubrics before you should provide a foundation for a truly holistic accountability system that incorporates whole child and whole system factors and supports equity of access, opportunity, and outcomes for all of our students in California.

03:26:44.767 --> 03:27:07.042
CTA strongly supports the board's overarching commitment to establishing a single integrated local, state, and federal accountability system that has the LCAP at its core and identifies specific strengths and weaknesses through a clear multiple measures dashboard.

03:27:07.742 --> 03:27:14.527
CTA also strongly supports the staff recommendation to complete further development

03:27:14.947 --> 03:27:31.242
on the college and career indicator, including student course taking information and options to measure access to an enrollment in a broad course of study as a state indicator for the next phase of the rubrics.

03:27:32.043 --> 03:27:49.504
Looking forward, CTA respectfully asked the board to clarify and confirm that a comprehensive statewide survey of school climate and conditions of learning will be developed and implemented as soon as possible.

03:27:50.285 --> 03:28:02.658
A rigorous, comprehensive, and annual assessment of climate and conditions of learning is a critical component of California's new holistic accountability system.

03:28:03.299 --> 03:28:08.224
It must be developed in a manner that allows it to serve as a state indicator

03:28:08.844 --> 03:28:22.252
In the meantime, it is important that the interim survey be administered annually to ensure alignment with other standards, indicators, and the LCAP annual update goal-setting and review process.

03:28:22.653 --> 03:28:34.320
Finally, we urge the Board to clarify how LEAs select local indicators or measures and how stakeholders will be consulted and involved in the critical process.

03:28:35.260 --> 03:28:49.063
CTA thanks you, thanks the board, everyone involved here for its consideration and looks forward to continuing to work together on this very historic California's accountability system.

03:28:49.283 --> 03:28:50.363
Thank you so much.

03:28:50.383 --> 03:28:54.364
Speakers 81 through 88 would please line up.

03:29:06.000 --> 03:29:10.582
Good morning President Kirsten, members of the State Board, John Affelt from Public Advocates.

03:29:13.383 --> 03:29:24.247
I too want to commend the Board on the direction it's taking and express our support for moving forward on a comprehensive multiple measure system.

03:29:26.749 --> 03:29:47.060
We're supportive of the board not unduly limiting itself to a narrow set of academic indicators set forth in the federal regulations, but continuing to try to implement a holistic multiple measure system that pays attention to all of the state's priorities.

03:29:48.180 --> 03:29:55.965
including parent engagement, including school climate, including standards implementation, including access to a broad course of study.

03:29:57.566 --> 03:30:04.390
Because we know those are part of what make comprehensive education possible.

03:30:06.131 --> 03:30:28.340
It's also important that in doing so you're not limiting intervention and technical assistance and support to simply a narrow set of academic test score indicators, but also to all of those measures, parent engagement, broad course of access, standards implementation, because those are worthy of attention too.

03:30:30.807 --> 03:30:39.129
Our support should certainly be understood as contingent on the ultimate question of it's gotta work, right?

03:30:39.589 --> 03:30:53.673
And this system is, we're not gonna NCLB our way out of underperformance by labeling all schools failures and imposing state required interventions.

03:30:54.153 --> 03:30:59.094
And the promise of this system is that that big yellow in the middle and many of those oranges

03:31:00.194 --> 03:31:10.025
are going to self-reflect and voluntarily see their weaknesses across the dimensions and improve without state assistance.

03:31:10.486 --> 03:31:17.173
So we support that intention and really want to see that that piece of it works.

03:31:19.875 --> 03:31:38.223
In line with that, we also want to note that we think a specific recommendation that you should direct the staff for the November framework to come back with at least one more tier of intervention in year one.

03:31:39.183 --> 03:31:44.665
We know in year one, it's not enough that everyone just get a letter saying, here are your strengths and weaknesses, which is the proposal.

03:31:45.366 --> 03:31:47.747
We want to see another tier of intervention that says,

03:31:48.787 --> 03:31:49.968
You're failing on everything.

03:31:50.148 --> 03:31:50.688
We know now.

03:31:50.769 --> 03:31:52.169
We don't need to just send you a letter.

03:31:52.249 --> 03:31:56.652
We should be doing stuff in year one, providing technical assistance and support.

03:31:57.073 --> 03:32:02.376
So we would request that you give that additional direction to staff for the November framework.

03:32:03.717 --> 03:32:07.940
And lastly, we support the notion of an integrated

03:32:09.901 --> 03:32:16.727
because this is not like NCOB where API and EYP both applied to schools and gave conflicting messages.

03:32:17.588 --> 03:32:27.876
You've got a system for schools with largely federal decision rules and a system for LEAs with largely LCFF decision rules, and they can fit together.

03:32:28.196 --> 03:32:28.717
Thank you very much.

03:32:37.217 --> 03:32:38.898
Hello, my name is Francisco Cortez.

03:32:39.078 --> 03:32:44.139
I am a junior in the San Jose region, and I've been involved with California for Justice for the past two years now.

03:32:44.740 --> 03:32:52.442
So we're here to thank you for including recommendations from students in the LCFF rubric, and we urge you to keep them in the final version as approved today.

03:32:52.462 --> 03:33:05.867
Specifically, we are pleased to see an equity report in the rubric's top-level display of school climate and student engagement measures as state indicators, as well as college and career readiness and English learning proficiency.

03:33:06.787 --> 03:33:20.856
So we're also happy with the progress that the state board has created like the school conditions and climate work group and including a CFJ representative and that you're getting feedback from students and parents on the display of the rubric so it can be accessible and community friendly.

03:33:21.617 --> 03:33:29.142
It means a lot to me having you all listen to our recommendations because every decision being made here impacts the students the most.

03:33:29.562 --> 03:33:32.003
So listening to what we have to say it's a huge step in the right direction.

03:33:32.464 --> 03:33:32.724
Thank you.

03:33:34.764 --> 03:33:38.947
If numbers 89 to 104 would please line up in the boardroom.

03:33:38.967 --> 03:33:41.989
Nancy, we're going to break at 12, so.

03:33:42.810 --> 03:33:43.390
Never mind.

03:33:43.870 --> 03:33:44.311
Okay.

03:33:45.972 --> 03:33:47.213
Good afternoon, board members.

03:33:47.273 --> 03:33:51.956
My name is Michelle Cantar, and I'm a 10th grader in San Jose and a leader with Californians for Justice.

03:33:52.876 --> 03:33:55.618
And I've also been involved in my district LCAP process throughout the year.

03:33:56.559 --> 03:34:01.983
As my teachers say, there's always room for improvement, so I want to point out a few of them in the LCFF rubric.

03:34:02.603 --> 03:34:17.193
We join with CTA, public advocates, ACLU, and the Riverside COE to request the commitment from the state board to create state indicator placeholders for course access and the recommendations that come from school conditions and climate work group.

03:34:17.853 --> 03:34:22.874
There are also a number of issues raised by the LCFF equity coalition that we hope you'll address.

03:34:23.735 --> 03:34:28.636
Overall, we're all really pleased with how far our state has come on the LCFF rubrics.

03:34:29.136 --> 03:34:34.037
We especially appreciate the time and consideration you've given to student voices.

03:34:34.997 --> 03:34:39.619
While being involved in Californians for Justice, I have learned what it means to be a student leader in my community.

03:34:40.099 --> 03:34:44.460
And I hope that together we can continue to engage more students to be empowered in their education.

03:34:44.620 --> 03:34:44.860
Thank you.

03:34:46.135 --> 03:34:54.278
Right, okay, it's 12 o'clock, and I think what we need to do is have the board, we'll recess till 12.15, you get your lunch, bring it back, and we'll eat it here.

03:34:54.418 --> 03:34:57.279
So 15 minute, we have the lunches there.

03:34:57.299 --> 03:35:02.121
Okay, and then we'll start with number 80 when we- Yeah, whatever, who's ever first comes.

03:36:21.980 --> 03:36:23.161
Yeah.

03:37:00.773 --> 03:37:00.916
you

03:38:36.601 --> 03:38:37.645
80 through 96 will please line up.

03:38:54.793 --> 03:38:57.035
I thought it was wise to wait till after you had your lunch.

03:38:58.556 --> 03:39:08.885
Good afternoon, LeAngela Reed on behalf of KROP, the Association of Career and College Readiness Organizations and the Small School Districts Association.

03:39:09.946 --> 03:39:16.752
On behalf of KROP, I just wanna thank the board and the staff for the tremendous work on the college and career indicator.

03:39:17.812 --> 03:39:22.937
We've come such a long way in recognizing the value of

03:39:23.317 --> 03:39:40.288
of both types of programs and KROP has made a kind of a revised version of the CCI we've shared with staff and we look forward to continuing to work with them on the inclusion of more points of readiness and getting to the end, truly getting to the end.

03:39:40.829 --> 03:39:52.917
On behalf of the Smalls, we want to thank you for recognizing their unique situation, the limitations that can sometimes be placed on them relative to size or geography, geographical location.

03:39:53.877 --> 03:40:00.121
also with regard to access to both higher ed and to employment or career development.

03:40:01.001 --> 03:40:02.302
So I want to say thank you very much.

03:40:07.681 --> 03:40:08.261
Good afternoon.

03:40:08.762 --> 03:40:11.143
I'm Doug McRae, a retired test publisher from Monterey.

03:40:11.843 --> 03:40:13.224
I'd like to make three quick points.

03:40:13.904 --> 03:40:23.208
First, there's been time slippage on the performance standards for several state indicators, most notably the academic indicators and the change aspect of other indicators.

03:40:23.728 --> 03:40:29.571
Also, no simulation data to support approval of the attachment form material.

03:40:30.671 --> 03:40:39.257
Second, there's widespread problems with data quality for the metrics needed to fulfill that multiple measures infrastructure.

03:40:40.097 --> 03:40:48.343
And third, indication that metrics will evolve and improve in the future runs contrary to the real world truism.

03:40:49.103 --> 03:40:52.584
That quote, if you want to measure change, then don't change the measure.

03:40:53.344 --> 03:40:54.865
That tension needs to be managed.

03:40:55.385 --> 03:41:09.709
A reasonable conclusion is that despite current statutory dates, the metrics needed for a new California multiple measures accountability system will not be ready for baseline status measures until spring 18 and spring 19, first year for change.

03:41:10.329 --> 03:41:13.810
That's the reality for a valid and credible new state assessment system.

03:41:14.430 --> 03:41:14.690
Thank you.

03:41:19.042 --> 03:41:26.726
Good afternoon, my name is Christine Chu and I'm a third grade elementary teacher in the Los Angeles Unified School District and Teach Plus Policy Fellow.

03:41:27.306 --> 03:41:38.912
While I agree with ESSA's new focus on multiple indicators and support for underserved populations, I do believe that there is still work that's needed to be done in the transparency and accessibility of the state report card.

03:41:39.532 --> 03:41:44.435
The public needs a clear way to understand and differentiate the performance of schools.

03:41:45.035 --> 03:41:54.042
Even through my lens as an educator, teacher leader and education policy fellow I still find it confusing to interpret particularly the equity report.

03:41:55.043 --> 03:42:04.691
A composite rating and multiple measures do not have to be mutually exclusive and without a composite rating it will be difficult to differentiate the performance between schools.

03:42:05.411 --> 03:42:10.875
The incorporation of both would be helpful to increase the accessibility and transparency of the state report card.

03:42:11.196 --> 03:42:11.496
Thank you.

03:42:16.587 --> 03:42:17.347
Good afternoon.

03:42:17.447 --> 03:42:19.968
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak today.

03:42:20.408 --> 03:42:22.368
My name is Faiza Makhani and I teach U.S.

03:42:22.408 --> 03:42:25.429
History for LAUSD at Paul Revere Charter Middle School.

03:42:25.929 --> 03:42:27.969
I'm currently a Teach Plus Policy Fellow.

03:42:28.429 --> 03:42:35.351
The new state accountability proposal has some great aspects to it, but I wanted to propose some recommendations you may already be considering.

03:42:35.951 --> 03:42:41.412
I urge the board to adopt a very clear reporting system that has numerical values attached to the color coding.

03:42:42.052 --> 03:42:51.684
As an educator, I need to know exactly where my school stands and how much, whether it's based on points or percentages, I need to improve to meet or go above the expectations.

03:42:52.485 --> 03:43:01.395
I also recommend the board to adopt an overall composite score so that there is a way to differentiate schools and a clear basis to identify struggling schools.

03:43:02.196 --> 03:43:08.463
It becomes a matter of equity to quickly and efficiently identify schools that need intervention and immediate support.

03:43:08.943 --> 03:43:13.208
A composite score and multiple measures do not have to be mutually exclusive.

03:43:13.629 --> 03:43:20.336
The composite score can be a weighted average of the multiple indicators with an emphasis on student growth and achievement.

03:43:20.376 --> 03:43:21.177
Thank you once again.

03:43:25.782 --> 03:43:31.947
Hi, my name is Chris Hoffman and I'm a fourth grade teacher in East Los Angeles and an alumnus of the Teach Plus Policy Fellowship as well.

03:43:32.768 --> 03:43:40.955
I could not be more excited to be here today on a day that the board votes to adopt the evaluation rubrics, a system that really honors the multiple dimensions that we value in a school.

03:43:41.836 --> 03:43:48.381
As we adopt these evaluation rubrics, I ask the board to be both bold and aspirational in designing the systems of intervention and support.

03:43:49.142 --> 03:43:55.224
As a classroom teacher at the beginning of each school year, I often feel overwhelmed by the task of me and the needs of all my students.

03:43:55.664 --> 03:44:00.205
And sometimes I feel like I don't have the capacity to give each student what he or she needs to be successful.

03:44:01.246 --> 03:44:03.226
But like countless other teachers, I keep trying.

03:44:03.426 --> 03:44:09.088
I try my best to identify the supports my students need and to put those systems and supports into action.

03:44:09.808 --> 03:44:12.911
Our state system needs to be based on the same principles of equity.

03:44:13.411 --> 03:44:19.317
Let's not let concerns about our capacity to provide supports lead us to minimize the number of schools identified for support.

03:44:19.917 --> 03:44:24.041
Focusing on the lowest 5% of schools is not enough, as ESSA requires.

03:44:24.641 --> 03:44:28.545
Please ensure that all students get the help they need by making sure that all schools get the help they need.

03:44:28.665 --> 03:44:28.885
Thank you.

03:44:32.802 --> 03:44:37.768
Hi, Brian Lee on behalf of Mission Readiness, Ready Nation, and Fight Crime Invest in Kids.

03:44:38.028 --> 03:44:46.498
A couple quick points, we're very excited about your adoption of a multiple measure accountability system, especially about including suspension rates.

03:44:46.638 --> 03:44:49.442
And we look forward to the addition of school climate surveys, which is planned.

03:44:50.783 --> 03:45:03.712
We're relieved by the clarification that school climate surveys are in for the, excuse me, that suspension rates are in for the foreseeable future, which is really important given the compelling research and the many and powerful voices you've heard about the need for that in the system.

03:45:04.312 --> 03:45:09.836
On college and career readiness, we're excited that we have a system that recognizes both college and career readiness.

03:45:10.156 --> 03:45:13.759
We appreciate what Board Member Strauss talking about problems with the 11th grade EAP.

03:45:14.399 --> 03:45:18.622
CSU says level three conditionally ready alone is not enough to avoid remediation.

03:45:19.683 --> 03:45:22.128
So this system should not say that it's enough.

03:45:22.749 --> 03:45:30.884
And finally, you've heard from others, there should be a work group on college and career readiness as CDE staff mentioned at the July board meeting, but it's not in the materials now.

03:45:31.445 --> 03:45:31.706
Thank you.

03:45:35.003 --> 03:45:35.824
Hi, good afternoon.

03:45:35.864 --> 03:45:40.706
Naina Gupta, staff attorney with the ACLU of California and member of the Equity Coalition.

03:45:40.866 --> 03:45:56.476
First, I just want to commend the board for following through on an accountability system that looks at multiple meaningful measures of a student's education experience, one that honors the complex and intractable challenges facing especially our low-income students of color.

03:45:57.276 --> 03:46:08.405
But if there's anything that we've learned these past two years, it's that a system that on paper honors our high-need students doesn't necessarily translate to better services for those high-need students.

03:46:09.005 --> 03:46:24.998
We've been disappointed to see too many districts failing to use LCFF dollars to increase and improve services for low-income students of color, and we've been especially frustrated with the failure of many county offices of education to effectively and uniformly implement LCFF.

03:46:26.019 --> 03:46:44.826
We believe that the success of the system you adopt today hinges in great part on the critical role that those county offices play in supporting districts and providing technical assistance, and that the obligation to ensure that they do that effectively lies not only in the hands of CCEE and county superintendents, but with the state as well.

03:46:45.046 --> 03:46:45.426
Thank you.

03:46:51.883 --> 03:46:54.866
I'm here representing the Coalition for Alternative Education Accountability.

03:46:55.427 --> 03:47:03.755
We provided you with a letter that you should have gotten today, and in that letter, we delineate some of our concerns and proposals in general.

03:47:04.195 --> 03:47:12.724
We recognize the fact that at this moment, you are not immediately considering an alternative assessment system, and that that is in the works.

03:47:13.284 --> 03:47:32.737
but we would like to go on record as seeking an alternative accountability measure that provides valid information both for schools and teachers and the state that measures things that make sense in programs that don't have your run-of-the-mill students.

03:47:34.017 --> 03:47:45.881
The schools that we're dealing with are dealing with a high level of transiency and a high level of students who are overage under credit.

03:47:46.361 --> 03:47:53.224
It's not unusual for our schools to be looking at students who are 17 years old when they enter the school and have 30 or less credits.

03:47:53.764 --> 03:47:54.564
Thank you for your time.

03:48:01.461 --> 03:48:08.225
Thank you all for your hard work pushing us to college and career readiness and looking at multiple measures.

03:48:08.865 --> 03:48:09.686
My name is Ama.

03:48:09.806 --> 03:48:16.070
I taught in the prison and public school system and now serve as the Executive Director of Educators for Excellence Los Angeles.

03:48:16.450 --> 03:48:21.553
I'm very proud to be standing with my teacher colleagues who are going to speak with you shortly.

03:48:22.513 --> 03:48:25.775
But I'm actually here as a parent.

03:48:26.275 --> 03:48:29.657
I'm here for my daughter, Asha, who is entering kindergarten next year.

03:48:29.677 --> 03:48:35.219
And here's what I need as a public education parent and partner.

03:48:35.239 --> 03:48:40.102
I want the conversation about school performance to be accessible and comprehensive.

03:48:40.502 --> 03:48:44.544
I want a dashboard full of indicators and a streamlined snapshot.

03:48:44.964 --> 03:48:48.746
More information will only help me be more empowered as a parent and a partner.

03:48:49.787 --> 03:48:55.895
I also want an accountability system that prioritizes closing achievement gaps for black and brown children like my daughter.

03:48:56.275 --> 03:49:05.648
And in 13 years when Asha graduates prepared for college, that has to mean she has met all the requirements for admission to CSU without remediation.

03:49:06.169 --> 03:49:06.970
Thank you very much.

03:49:12.719 --> 03:49:14.140
My name is Tunji Adebayo.

03:49:14.200 --> 03:49:16.120
I'm a high school science teacher in LA.

03:49:17.141 --> 03:49:21.242
And I had my students vote on whether I should come here today or whether I should stay and teach.

03:49:22.103 --> 03:49:25.104
And they voted that their voices needed to be heard.

03:49:25.844 --> 03:49:37.869
And those voices are calling for equity and clarity, like the voice of Marco's mom who currently doesn't have the high school education he's receiving, whose little sister had to translate the question, what high school should Marco go to?

03:49:38.689 --> 03:49:39.670
I did not have an answer.

03:49:40.930 --> 03:49:45.832
Equity is Marco's mom being able to read the evaluation rubrics and make an informed decision for herself.

03:49:46.973 --> 03:49:54.115
Equity is my mentee, Jason, his mother knowing that he goes to a school that is in the bottom 20 to 30% and does not meet the state standard.

03:49:54.976 --> 03:49:58.097
Equity is her being able to take action if she chooses to.

03:49:59.897 --> 03:50:06.180
Equity is us not pretending that the bottom 5% are the only schools that need help, and us creating capacity to fit the need.

03:50:07.082 --> 03:50:17.837
We have to have the courage to be honest about where we are and the tenacity and creativity to build a system where all stakeholders can understand and then fight to make that change.

03:50:18.518 --> 03:50:18.839
Thank you.

03:50:19.820 --> 03:50:24.026
If numbers 97 through 104 would please line up in the boardroom.

03:50:25.902 --> 03:50:26.503
Good afternoon.

03:50:26.563 --> 03:50:30.646
My name is Erica Silva, and I'm a sixth grade math teacher and doctoral candidate at USC.

03:50:31.146 --> 03:50:38.352
As a daughter of immigrant parents, I know firsthand the value of education and its ability to transform the trajectory of a family and a community.

03:50:38.833 --> 03:50:43.417
As a teacher, I urge you to consider the ease and readability of the plan rating system.

03:50:43.937 --> 03:50:52.745
I encourage you to pilot the rating system across the state with multiple stakeholder groups to ensure that it will benefit all families, regardless of their background.

03:50:53.709 --> 03:51:01.233
I make these recommendations because of my former student Christina and thousands like her who translated all school documents into Spanish for her mother.

03:51:01.253 --> 03:51:17.182
I know that Christina's mom wants the best education for her daughter and it is up to us to break down barriers to access by providing easy to read and understand information so that all parents regardless of their background can make informed decisions regarding their child's educational future.

03:51:17.522 --> 03:51:18.623
Thank you for your consideration.

03:51:22.363 --> 03:51:22.883
Good afternoon.

03:51:24.223 --> 03:51:25.204
My name is Freddy Guzman.

03:51:25.424 --> 03:51:27.484
I teach seventh grade math and science in Los Angeles.

03:51:27.504 --> 03:51:31.885
I'm a proud father and the president of the Salvadoran American Leadership and Educational Fund.

03:51:32.605 --> 03:51:33.746
Today I want to tell you about Ms.

03:51:33.786 --> 03:51:35.126
Mundell, my sixth grade teacher.

03:51:35.986 --> 03:51:37.166
For the duration of sixth grade, Ms.

03:51:37.206 --> 03:51:38.947
Mundell never let us go to the playground.

03:51:39.607 --> 03:51:42.528
We only left our classwork when it was time to eat or go to the bathroom.

03:51:43.208 --> 03:51:47.929
This teacher had the highest standard of any teacher at our school and maybe in all East LA.

03:51:49.110 --> 03:51:49.490
Being in Ms.

03:51:49.530 --> 03:51:52.132
Mandel's class was not easy, but we loved it because Ms.

03:51:52.172 --> 03:51:55.114
Mandel did not focus on our obstacles.

03:51:55.594 --> 03:51:56.875
She focused on our potential.

03:51:57.895 --> 03:51:58.355
Just like Ms.

03:51:58.395 --> 03:52:02.298
Mandel, our state needs to build a system of high expectations for all students.

03:52:03.058 --> 03:52:05.800
I believe every student deserves a fighting chance at life.

03:52:06.496 --> 03:52:12.118
But we don't give them that by lowering expectations or minimizing the number of schools we identify for supports.

03:52:12.999 --> 03:52:18.421
As a teacher, I serve my students best by sharing optimal teaching practices with other teachers.

03:52:19.201 --> 03:52:26.684
Similarly, the state could share valuable knowledge between those schools with persistent gaps in those that have shown great improvement.

03:52:27.385 --> 03:52:30.066
Need to send a great message that we believe in them to our students.

03:52:30.146 --> 03:52:30.366
Thank you.

03:52:34.155 --> 03:52:34.675
Good afternoon.

03:52:35.516 --> 03:52:35.996
Good afternoon.

03:52:36.036 --> 03:52:39.157
Jessica Sacco representing the California Science Teachers Association.

03:52:39.177 --> 03:52:45.879
I want to thank the State Board and California Department of Education staff for the excellent work that they have done over these last few years.

03:52:45.899 --> 03:53:02.826
We've made a lot of progress and we're really pleased where we are today as well as completely honoring the process of continuous improvement that you're looking forward to putting in place as this progresses because we agree there is more work to be done and we stand ready to continue participating in this process.

03:53:03.286 --> 03:53:09.068
I'd like to thank member Strauss for her acknowledgement about the need to address broad course of study at the elementary years.

03:53:09.428 --> 03:53:19.231
We agree this is critical, this is when it begins, and this is what we need in order to have our students ready to prepare to fill the colleges, excuse me, the careers that California's gonna need in the future.

03:53:19.971 --> 03:53:28.375
Finally, I ask that you consider our recommendation to allow for additional criterias for the local performance indicators in order to allow locals to demonstrate progress.

03:53:28.455 --> 03:53:32.276
Currently, met, not met, not met for two years doesn't allow you to show progress.

03:53:32.436 --> 03:53:35.998
Implementation of state standards takes more than two years, many years.

03:53:36.338 --> 03:53:37.919
Please allow for progress to be demonstrated.

03:53:38.079 --> 03:53:38.339
Thank you.

03:53:42.648 --> 03:53:46.149
Elizabeth Robitaille on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association.

03:53:46.629 --> 03:54:03.113
As we have referenced in the letters we've submitted to you in July and September, we remain concerned that without further clarity from the State Board, the many metrics in the LCAP rubric may devolve into many ways for an authorizer to justify closing a successful charter school or renewing a chronically underperforming one.

03:54:03.673 --> 03:54:14.166
We therefore ask the state board to clarify how LCAP will intersect the charter renewal and will align with state law requiring academic achievement to be the most important factor in determining charter renewal.

03:54:14.646 --> 03:54:19.933
Without this clarity, charter school authorizers are proceeding even now with charter renewal determinations

03:54:20.293 --> 03:54:21.934
with highly varying interpretations.

03:54:22.514 --> 03:54:36.243
This clarity on charter LCAP rubrics is also crucial because charter schools are afforded additional flexibility and statute to address only aspects of the eight state priorities that apply to the grade levels served or the nature of the program operated by the charter school.

03:54:36.784 --> 03:54:44.208
We look forward to working with the state board and staff to clarify how the LCAP rubric and template will align with the laws guiding charter school accountability.

03:54:44.449 --> 03:54:44.749
Thank you.

03:54:48.561 --> 03:54:49.161
Good afternoon.

03:54:49.281 --> 03:54:56.904
I'm Molly Dunn with the Alliance for Children's Rights and a member of a coalition of advocates who represent children in foster care.

03:54:57.845 --> 03:54:58.605
Just a few notes.

03:54:59.165 --> 03:55:05.868
First, we really commend you on all of the hard work over the last two years to get to this really historic moment that we're at today.

03:55:07.168 --> 03:55:17.911
Secondly, we're pleased to see the inclusion of prompts that could be included in a self-assessment tool for Priority 10, which is, of course, the COE, Coordination of Services for Children in Foster Care.

03:55:18.432 --> 03:55:29.255
And we look forward to continuing to work with the SBE and CDE staff to develop a Priority 10 self-assessment tool that can be used by districts throughout the state, or rather, county offices throughout the state.

03:55:29.875 --> 03:55:39.038
We also appreciate discussions we've had with SBE staff around end size for foster youth and that we understand that there's an ongoing commitment to keep that at 15.

03:55:39.938 --> 03:55:47.740
And finally, we continue to be concerned about a plan to have a separate accountability system for students attending alternative schools.

03:55:47.860 --> 03:55:50.361
Foster youth are disproportionately in alternative schools.

03:55:51.221 --> 03:55:51.501
Thank you.

03:55:54.955 --> 03:55:57.717
Good afternoon, Jackie Wong with the National Center for Youth Law.

03:55:58.097 --> 03:56:03.379
I'm here on behalf of foster youth that we represent through our foster initiative.

03:56:04.200 --> 03:56:13.885
I just want to underscore what my colleague Molly Dunn had spoken to really appreciate what the board staff has done and the board members who have spoken out over time in supporting the needs of students in foster care.

03:56:13.925 --> 03:56:21.149
We look forward to continuing to collaborate with you all as well as the Department of Education to make sure that we fulfill the promise of LCFF for students in foster care.

03:56:21.189 --> 03:56:21.709
Thank you so much.

03:56:28.539 --> 03:56:32.480
Mr. President, I'm Brian Rivas speaking on behalf of the Education Trust West.

03:56:34.021 --> 03:56:35.701
I'll just quickly bullet for you.

03:56:35.721 --> 03:56:36.961
We have a few concerns.

03:56:37.201 --> 03:56:43.463
One is with the schedule for delivery of assistance to LEAs identified as such.

03:56:44.223 --> 03:56:57.487
I think one of my colleagues in the Equity Coalition, Mr. Affelt, may have commented that in year one, the schedule calls for a letter and then actual assistance wouldn't be provided until a subsequent year.

03:56:57.947 --> 03:56:59.407
We think that may be too long.

03:56:59.447 --> 03:57:06.469
We ask that you look at triaging the needs of some LEAs that may be not meeting standards for multiple subgroups.

03:57:07.069 --> 03:57:14.471
And with regard to state standards and the cut points, we think that needs to be communicated a little more clearly.

03:57:14.611 --> 03:57:24.293
We're worried that the fact that green is the goal may not come across clearly, that that can be remedied by noting that on the top level display.

03:57:25.094 --> 03:57:31.905
And we want you to take note of the fact that we're worried that some may read that and think the standard is to avoid red.

03:57:38.134 --> 03:57:40.295
Good afternoon, my name is Samantha Tran with Children Now.

03:57:40.695 --> 03:57:45.497
We've submitted lengthy comments for your review and we're well aligned with Dr. Weber's statement as well.

03:57:46.138 --> 03:57:48.639
We'd strongly encourage the board to delay action today.

03:57:48.659 --> 03:58:06.827
I know there's time pressures, but we've been staunch advocates of multiple measures in multiple contexts in LCFF, AB 2548, and so we're well aligned with you on that front and in the goal to make sure we have true support and assistance to schools and districts.

03:58:07.267 --> 03:58:13.912
What we are concerned with, and we have appreciated the comments today about creating an aligned system, but what you have before you isn't that.

03:58:14.032 --> 03:58:20.917
There are key equity guardrails in ESSA in statute, not the regulations, that aren't being baked into the system.

03:58:21.197 --> 03:58:27.061
That includes academics having substantial weight, differential improvement standards for students that are furthest behind.

03:58:27.501 --> 03:58:28.722
meaningful differentiation.

03:58:28.742 --> 03:58:32.383
These are really important key things that need to be baked into the system.

03:58:33.044 --> 03:58:38.866
In addition, we're really concerned that the board is being asked to vote on something without clarity about the implications for those decisions.

03:58:39.206 --> 03:58:43.988
The data runs we've seen so far don't show how many LEAs and schools are going to be identified.

03:58:44.569 --> 03:58:49.891
We strongly encourage you to take a little bit more time, work with multiple groups, and see if we can move this forward.

03:58:50.011 --> 03:58:50.331
Thank you.

03:58:51.812 --> 03:58:54.493
Will the remaining speakers please line up in the boardroom?

03:58:56.175 --> 03:59:01.097
Hi, my name is Elizabeth Frank and I'm here to speak a little bit about alternative schools and their needs.

03:59:01.818 --> 03:59:06.580
I want to thank Dr. Strauss for keeping alternative schools in the dialogue and

03:59:08.393 --> 03:59:14.902
We really want to stress the importance of considering alternative schools and their needs when considering these accountability measures.

03:59:15.382 --> 03:59:22.852
Because alternative schools work with a unique set of students, the accountability measures traditionally used don't always best support student outcomes.

03:59:23.453 --> 03:59:26.257
One of those is the four-year cohort graduation rate.

03:59:26.637 --> 03:59:42.527
If you get kids in who are over age and behind on credits, they're not going to be able to graduate within four years of getting to these alternative schools and the schools need a chance to really show that what they're doing works beyond that four year rate.

03:59:43.927 --> 03:59:49.511
One of the things we've looked at is retention because even one more day in school really helps these students.

03:59:50.271 --> 04:00:01.151
So we just really want to stress the importance to us that these accountability measures support retention and student outcomes for all students, not just traditional school students.

04:00:06.055 --> 04:00:14.666
Hi, my name is Lauren Cullen, and I'm here with Elizabeth Frank, the previous speaker, speaking on behalf of Alternative Educational Programs.

04:00:15.527 --> 04:00:24.738
With our unique situation, we've also focused heavily on less tangible aspects of school performance, such as school climate and the social-emotional development of our students.

04:00:25.399 --> 04:00:29.682
These are the strengths of our programs and they're vital to the success of our students.

04:00:30.282 --> 04:00:43.090
For example, our schools offer specific curriculum for social-emotional development that very often re-engages our students in their education and gives them the opportunity to take ownership of what they're doing in school.

04:00:43.791 --> 04:00:52.876
This in turn increases student performance, credit completion and progression, retention in our program, and ultimately graduation from high school.

04:00:53.957 --> 04:01:05.751
This is an area that we would like for you to be considered in a unique way beyond simple surveys for alternative programs as they may be strength specific and separate from how we hold traditional schools accountable.

04:01:06.232 --> 04:01:06.873
Thank you so much.

04:01:10.768 --> 04:01:14.590
Hello, my name is Andrew Medina representing Asian Americans Advancing Justice California.

04:01:14.610 --> 04:01:28.959
Advancing Justice California is a partner in the College for All Coalition, a multiracial and cross-sector coalition of community education, student, parent, labor, faith, and civil rights organizations that are united in our vision of renewed investment in California public higher education.

04:01:29.659 --> 04:01:35.403
I formally submitted a letter today on College for All's recommendations regarding the need for transparent, effective,

04:01:35.823 --> 04:01:47.159
and equitable implementation of 200 million K-12 college readiness block grant which has recently been established in the California state budget to serve students who are low-income English learners and foster youth.

04:01:47.860 --> 04:01:52.627
This letter is signed by over 30 diverse organizations and alliances throughout the state that are members of the College for All coalition.

04:01:54.147 --> 04:02:02.311
Our recommendation center and ensuring that the funds are used as intended to increase the college readiness and eligibility of students who are low income English learners and foster youth.

04:02:03.051 --> 04:02:15.376
Some of the recommendations include defining LCFF plus schools as schools that have enrolled an average of 75% or more students who are LCFF over a three year rather than one year period, as well as just ensuring proper reporting.

04:02:15.456 --> 04:02:17.837
So we look forward to working with the State Board of Education on this.

04:02:24.002 --> 04:02:25.883
Good afternoon, State Board members.

04:02:25.943 --> 04:02:27.404
My name is Doneshia Carlos.

04:02:27.785 --> 04:02:31.067
I am the founder of Lifting Education, Activating Parents.

04:02:31.547 --> 04:02:35.330
I'm a parent activist and I am the mother of three and the grandparent of one.

04:02:36.050 --> 04:02:49.320
And I would like to stress today the importance of not just talking about equity and accountability, but also acting in an equitable fashion as it relates to the transparency and the accessibility of the LCFF.

04:02:50.620 --> 04:03:08.005
While we can get caught in the weeds about what the new accountability system looks like, feels like, and how it works, that issue becomes moot if the most important, if not the most important group of people are not included, and that is parents.

04:03:08.385 --> 04:03:20.071
Parents are the first educators of our children, but yet they are the most underrepresented when it comes to making decisions and implementing systems in education.

04:03:20.271 --> 04:03:22.372
That is not an equitable process.

04:03:23.333 --> 04:03:28.135
Creating, revamping and implementing systems without involvement is not an equitable process.

04:03:28.455 --> 04:03:33.738
And I ask that the board take a good look at that when furthering their decisions on this system.

04:03:33.798 --> 04:03:34.138
Thank you.

04:03:41.417 --> 04:03:42.738
My name is Candace Forrester.

04:03:43.059 --> 04:03:46.542
I'm a parent, an educator, and the co-founder of Project Equity.

04:03:47.563 --> 04:03:54.310
Our schools and education systems are charged with the responsibility of providing all students with a quality education.

04:03:54.910 --> 04:04:01.557
However, not all schooling is created equal, and that's evident by our alarming achievement, discipline, and access gaps.

04:04:02.546 --> 04:04:05.128
I urge you today to do something honorable and radical.

04:04:05.729 --> 04:04:11.273
I urge you to meet schools and districts where they are and offer students what they need to be successful.

04:04:12.074 --> 04:04:16.618
Please make sure that our new accountability system is truly one that is aspirational.

04:04:18.499 --> 04:04:23.864
Rather than focusing on the failing while ignoring those who are struggling does not work.

04:04:25.657 --> 04:04:33.659
Rather, it's an example of limited problem solving skills and a limited capacity to think collaboratively and creatively.

04:04:34.459 --> 04:04:46.922
So again, I ask that in our plans to develop a new system of accountability, we hold ourselves to the same standards that we hold our students and our teachers when we ask them to be creative, flexible, and 21st century problem solvers.

04:04:51.274 --> 04:04:52.795
Good afternoon, my name is Carmen Perkins.

04:04:52.855 --> 04:04:56.177
I'm a parent, educator, and co-founder of Project Equity with Candace Forrester.

04:04:56.997 --> 04:05:13.666
As we think about implementing the new LCFF, I ask that you consider how equity will be addressed for school leaders, school board members, and administrators who are currently in the red to really consider how they will be held accountable and what the measures of getting them out of the red and into the blue will be.

04:05:13.686 --> 04:05:15.226
I think too often we forget

04:05:16.787 --> 04:05:25.314
while addressing just saying schools are failing, we need to actually hold those teachers, those administrators, and those board members accountable for our students not getting to where they need to be.

04:05:25.735 --> 04:05:26.035
Thank you.

04:05:30.739 --> 04:05:31.339
Good afternoon.

04:05:31.539 --> 04:05:33.641
My name is Maria Montes and I'm from Stockton.

04:05:33.861 --> 04:05:42.188
I'm a part of the Stockton Schools Initiative and I'm here to talk about how I immigrated from Mexico originally.

04:05:42.268 --> 04:05:43.869
My family's from Mexico and I

04:05:45.245 --> 04:05:56.217
Coming here I struggled learning English, but fortunately I had a teacher who cared and I was able to excel and now I will be the first in my family to attend college.

04:05:56.778 --> 04:06:05.727
But as the recent SBAC test results show us, there are many English learners who are struggling and the achievement gaps are widening.

04:06:06.588 --> 04:06:11.989
This should be unacceptable to all of us as English learners make one in four students in California.

04:06:12.590 --> 04:06:23.112
An accountability system is not equitable if a district or school can still be considered good even when English learners are not doing well.

04:06:23.332 --> 04:06:28.894
I urge the board to do everything it can to ensure that English learners are not hidden in a dashboard and left behind.

04:06:29.074 --> 04:06:29.334
Thank you.

04:06:33.769 --> 04:06:34.930
Good afternoon, board members.

04:06:34.970 --> 04:06:38.393
My name is Jasmine Delafoss and I'm with the South Stockton Schools Initiative as well.

04:06:39.354 --> 04:06:45.860
And we are very active in our local control accountability plan back home in Stockton, and as you know, is very poor.

04:06:47.702 --> 04:06:54.468
And I know that because I've seen it firsthand that the lack of accountability and that the

04:06:55.729 --> 04:06:59.070
the lack of accountability have failed our students and families as well as our communities.

04:06:59.830 --> 04:07:14.415
So while we're here today, it's time that we really pull up our bootstraps and time for us to be honest about transparency and time for us to be creative about how we are redesigning schools and accountability in our school systems, which means including parents and students in these conversations.

04:07:14.835 --> 04:07:19.936
I invite you to come to Stockton and talk to our parents and our students because our district fails to do that.

04:07:20.276 --> 04:07:22.237
And I kindly invite you and we will host you

04:07:22.657 --> 04:07:27.778
if you really want to talk to parents and students so you can understand the issues we are facing in our communities.

04:07:28.719 --> 04:07:41.582
The state shouldn't have, shouldn't limit or dictate the student achievement because of the capacity you have and so we hope that you prioritize equity and hold that truth to our students.

04:07:42.182 --> 04:07:42.462
Thank you.

04:07:45.862 --> 04:07:46.522
Good afternoon.

04:07:46.802 --> 04:07:50.924
I really want to tell you first, I appreciate you enduring 150 comments.

04:07:51.664 --> 04:07:52.204
That's a lot.

04:07:52.304 --> 04:07:54.885
I can't even imagine what it's like to be a moment in your shoes.

04:07:55.325 --> 04:07:57.085
I just, yeah, praying for you.

04:07:57.666 --> 04:07:59.226
So my name is Dr. April Clay.

04:07:59.246 --> 04:08:05.588
I'm a parent, first and foremost, of six wonderful children in San Bernardino, California, five of whom are in college.

04:08:05.988 --> 04:08:07.649
and one remains in high school.

04:08:07.669 --> 04:08:08.850
Yeah, that look, right.

04:08:09.430 --> 04:08:13.393
I enjoy them and I love them, but more importantly, I advocate for them.

04:08:13.733 --> 04:08:18.377
And I do that not just by myself, but among other parents and with schools and leaders.

04:08:18.717 --> 04:08:23.220
And I'm here today with a group of parent leaders advocating on behalf of our students.

04:08:23.540 --> 04:08:26.702
So let me share with you first that I am a licensed marriage and family therapist.

04:08:27.042 --> 04:08:30.605
I am a researcher, an advocate, and a parent advocate as well.

04:08:31.085 --> 04:08:37.067
In the schools, I've seen a lot of things over the 35 years as a student, as a parent, as a counselor in the schools as well.

04:08:37.387 --> 04:08:42.069
And I will say that one thing that we want to make sure this matrix includes is teeth.

04:08:42.569 --> 04:08:53.593
It's important to say that we want to have our kids succeed, but without being very transparent and having clear goals that the schools understand and having teeth to support it, I'm concerned that it won't be equitable for our kids.

04:08:53.633 --> 04:08:59.635
We want to make sure that they truly do whatever it is that you're setting as the bar, all of our schools meet it, not just those in the red.

04:08:59.675 --> 04:09:00.335
Thank you very much.

04:09:04.758 --> 04:09:05.418
Good afternoon.

04:09:05.438 --> 04:09:07.099
My name is Jewel Patterson.

04:09:07.119 --> 04:09:11.260
I'm a recent graduate from the University of Redlands and a youth organizer in San Bernardino.

04:09:12.060 --> 04:09:16.321
I first want to thank you all for your work that you've been doing on the state's accountability system.

04:09:17.102 --> 04:09:24.764
I'm here today as a voice for my community's youth and to ask you to prioritize equity in the accountability system decisions that are left to be made.

04:09:25.584 --> 04:09:38.067
As a youth organizer who works hard to empower youth to get involved with their education, I can tell you firsthand that information that is accessible and understandable is key to getting youth, or anyone for that matter, engaged.

04:09:38.447 --> 04:09:45.289
So as you contemplate decisions around the top level display, I ask you to ensure that the equity report be clear and prominent.

04:09:45.849 --> 04:09:46.490
Additionally, some

04:09:47.930 --> 04:09:56.594
kind of at-glance summary, along with the multiple measures, will be extremely helpful for everyone to quickly see how schools and districts are doing.

04:09:57.154 --> 04:10:03.376
Because honestly, district administrators aren't the only ones that need the information about a district or school's performance.

04:10:03.957 --> 04:10:04.537
Everyone does.

04:10:04.977 --> 04:10:09.979
So that if there are problems, everyone, including youth, can be part of the solution.

04:10:10.219 --> 04:10:11.540
And that's what equity looks like.

04:10:12.000 --> 04:10:12.320
Thank you.

04:10:20.083 --> 04:10:20.664
Good afternoon.

04:10:20.824 --> 04:10:21.846
My name is Mia Cooper.

04:10:22.187 --> 04:10:25.313
I'm a parent of five kids from eight months to 21.

04:10:25.473 --> 04:10:28.579
I'm from San Bernardino, and I'm a gay parent.

04:10:33.584 --> 04:10:44.534
for a number of years and plan on remaining at the table to ensure that the state cannibal system works and consider parents like me who desire to be involved in the process.

04:10:44.935 --> 04:10:46.356
This is why I'm here today.

04:10:47.337 --> 04:10:51.380
First, thank you for all your hard work and secondly to ask you for equality.

04:10:51.941 --> 04:10:54.283
Be front and center as you make these final decisions.

04:10:54.643 --> 04:10:55.424
After all, parents

04:10:57.392 --> 04:11:06.695
are the primary audience of the purpose-top-level display of an accountability system that prioritizes equality.

04:11:06.735 --> 04:11:15.998
Consider me, because in short, I am a partner of the district or the school to help them continue improving, because after all, we're in this together.

04:11:17.287 --> 04:11:27.674
While I can appreciate the multiple measures in the accountability system, but if I or the parents don't understand, how can we help our kids?

04:11:27.895 --> 04:11:28.235
Thank you.

04:11:33.393 --> 04:11:34.053
Good afternoon.

04:11:34.374 --> 04:11:39.817
My name is Pastor Sam Casey, and I'm the Executive Director of Congregations Organized for Prophetic Engagement, or COPE.

04:11:41.017 --> 04:11:55.986
As a pastor, and most importantly, as a parent of three daughters who have matriculated through the public school system, I want to thank this board for your hard work thus far, but ask you to make equity the order of the day in the decisions that are left to be made on today.

04:11:57.086 --> 04:12:09.622
I fought for LCFF along with other parent advocates and faith leaders within San Bernardino County because it promotes equity and holds the promise of closing opportunity access and achievement gaps.

04:12:10.383 --> 04:12:11.785
As the new SBAC test shows,

04:12:12.385 --> 04:12:30.836
results show more must be done to close these gaps and it starts with strong accountability systems that truly prioritize equity by setting high expectations for all students and incentivize districts to reach ambitious yet achievable goals for student growth in closing all gaps.

04:12:31.917 --> 04:12:45.626
A system that truly prioritizes equity is honest about the numbers of districts and schools who are identified as needing support and has equity reports that are easy and clear for parents and constituents to understand.

04:12:46.226 --> 04:12:47.547
Thank you so much for your time today.

04:12:47.587 --> 04:12:53.371
And in closing, President Kirst and Board, Superintendent, it's important, additionally,

04:12:54.213 --> 04:12:59.195
that you include beyond one year measuring suspensions and expulsions.

04:12:59.495 --> 04:13:00.815
Please reconsider that effort.

04:13:01.076 --> 04:13:01.776
Thank you so much.

04:13:08.178 --> 04:13:09.198
Good afternoon members.

04:13:09.539 --> 04:13:16.041
My name is Charles Brown and I live in San Bernardino and I'm a parent of five and a grandparent of two.

04:13:16.821 --> 04:13:21.243
I want to thank the board for his work on accountability systems and I especially

04:13:22.276 --> 04:13:27.720
appreciate your work around multiple measures including a measure for school climate.

04:13:28.261 --> 04:13:40.110
I'm here to ask you to improve upon what we what you have already done so that parents and the community can clearly easily and quickly make sense of a district school performance.

04:13:40.531 --> 04:13:51.620
Specialty improvements can be made on the equity report section of the data display to make it more clear and prominent for everyone to understand how students subgroups

04:13:52.634 --> 04:13:53.395
are performing.

04:13:53.575 --> 04:14:00.041
Transparency and accessibility are cornerstones of an accountability system rooted in equity.

04:14:00.562 --> 04:14:12.713
Your job is to minimize the confusion and take the guessing out of a system that is supposed to let the public, not just administrators, know how a district or school is performing.

04:14:13.113 --> 04:14:15.195
We're counting on you.

04:14:15.355 --> 04:14:15.696
Thank you.

04:14:20.026 --> 04:14:23.368
Good afternoon, Terry Burns on behalf of the California School Boards Association.

04:14:24.309 --> 04:14:34.557
In adopting the system today, we believe you have given us a strong starting point with which to express, compare, and put in context data about our schools.

04:14:35.397 --> 04:14:42.563
The conversation over the last years has already been helpful as districts focus on the priorities and measures that you've been talking about.

04:14:43.323 --> 04:14:50.206
Boards have begun asking for and discussing data in new ways and changing their practices as a result.

04:14:51.187 --> 04:14:53.007
Change is already happening in our schools.

04:14:53.548 --> 04:15:00.771
We are implementing professional development, new materials, and new practices to address the individual needs of students.

04:15:01.471 --> 04:15:08.955
As we have more experience with the better data and new efforts, we're confident that achievement gaps will continue to close more quickly.

04:15:09.835 --> 04:15:20.606
We look forward to continuing to work with you for the continuous improvement of this accountability system in the ways indicated in our letter and many of the ways indicated by the public today.

04:15:21.247 --> 04:15:22.809
Thank you for being so attentive.

04:15:28.086 --> 04:15:29.828
Good afternoon, my name is Carl Pinkston.

04:15:29.848 --> 04:15:32.650
I'm an operational director for the Black Parallel School Board.

04:15:32.670 --> 04:15:38.536
We're a community-based organization located in Sacramento that parallels the Sacramento City Unified School District.

04:15:39.056 --> 04:15:51.748
I want to thank you and acknowledge that this board moving in the right direction and looking at and proposing multiple measures of evaluating districts and schools as well.

04:15:52.248 --> 04:16:01.530
Most particularly in the area of suspension and suspension rate, which is critical to closing the educational gap of kids of color.

04:16:02.210 --> 04:16:06.751
Also, we want to make clear that two points.

04:16:06.931 --> 04:16:10.932
One is, and I'll read real quick, parent participation or parent engagement.

04:16:10.972 --> 04:16:13.193
We need to change it from participation to parent engagement.

04:16:13.433 --> 04:16:15.253
Couple of things about parent engagement.

04:16:15.953 --> 04:16:19.474
We really need to look at acceptance of a parent recommendation rate.

04:16:20.254 --> 04:16:25.716
participation rates by ethnicity and gender.

04:16:26.296 --> 04:16:30.397
A positive participation rate, how positive relationship that is.

04:16:30.837 --> 04:16:38.339
And lastly, and most importantly, as it relates to suspension, a child cannot learn if they're not in the classroom.

04:16:38.359 --> 04:16:40.460
So please keep that on the burner.

04:16:45.189 --> 04:16:45.730
Good afternoon.

04:16:45.770 --> 04:16:48.051
My name is Afrin Mercado from the County Superintendent's Association.

04:16:48.652 --> 04:16:53.155
I just wanted to say thank you for all your hard work, and we are supportive of the adoption of the evaluation rubrics.

04:16:53.575 --> 04:16:59.780
I think this is a key step forward for our state to have a single local, state, and federal accountability system that is coherent and aligned.

04:17:00.480 --> 04:17:28.114
We do understand that there will be work moving forward to refine the system and the evaluation rubrics and we're happy to support the state board and CDE in that effort and we also feel it to be very important the messaging to the field regarding the evaluation rubrics and eventually the template in November and the nexus of those two documents are two tools that come together to impact the field and the better that we are with messaging and their implementation, the better job that we'll be able to do to close the achievement gap and boost student outcomes forward for our state.

04:17:28.434 --> 04:17:28.674
Thank you.

04:17:34.895 --> 04:17:36.736
Good afternoon, Sarah Lillis with EdVoice.

04:17:36.997 --> 04:17:46.324
You've received many letters from us over the last few years about how important we feel that the focus on academic outcomes and closing achievement and opportunity gaps are in these rubrics.

04:17:47.024 --> 04:17:55.851
And as we reflect on the progress we've made, we really see that you've made significant gains from previous recommendations where we were only looking at two grade spans when you're talking about academic outcomes.

04:17:55.871 --> 04:17:58.193
So we applaud the progress that has been made.

04:17:58.913 --> 04:18:08.315
But as board members have said, as constituents have said, it's still a work in progress with some key issues needing explicit board direction.

04:18:08.335 --> 04:18:18.478
And you've seen them in our letters, you've heard them from others, namely refining the college and career readiness indicator, the 11th grade assessment as an academic outcome, we still think is an important conversation.

04:18:19.158 --> 04:18:26.640
And as Dr. Weber remembered, some of the additional questions that need to be answered to make sure that this truly is a unified local state federal system.

04:18:26.880 --> 04:18:35.285
and the messages that are being sent by the rubrics and the top line interface, whether it's about equity or what our expectations are.

04:18:35.405 --> 04:18:36.806
What is the green that we're going to?

04:18:36.926 --> 04:18:40.609
And so I think that's an important conversation we hope you have, and we'd be happy to work with you on all those things.

04:18:40.629 --> 04:18:40.909
Thank you.

04:18:44.289 --> 04:18:46.271
Eric Premack with the Charter Schools Development Center.

04:18:46.371 --> 04:18:51.255
We're here again to express our concern about the disconnect between charter law and the rubrics.

04:18:52.176 --> 04:19:05.789
As I understand the motion before you now, it essentially would impose these indicators on charter schools, even though state law indicates that they're supposed to have flexibility with respect to whether to include these indicators in their LCAP.

04:19:06.269 --> 04:19:17.675
We would ask if you're going to adopt this motion today that you amend it to specifically note that it only applies to charter schools to the extent that their LCAP reflects the state priorities related to those indicators.

04:19:18.335 --> 04:19:29.141
And we would also ask that any state-level multicolored smiley face displays only show those indicators for charter schools that they have adopted in their LCAPs.

04:19:29.261 --> 04:19:29.561
Thank you.

04:19:34.298 --> 04:19:34.898
Good afternoon.

04:19:35.118 --> 04:19:35.439
Thank you.

04:19:35.479 --> 04:19:39.841
My name is Castle Redmond, program manager with the California Endowment.

04:19:41.162 --> 04:19:42.122
Thank you, Dr. Kirst.

04:19:42.783 --> 04:19:44.224
Thank you, Superintendent Torlakson.

04:19:44.264 --> 04:19:45.064
Thank you, board.

04:19:46.025 --> 04:19:50.207
We want to congratulate you and thank you for the great work that you've done.

04:19:51.188 --> 04:19:59.712
We appreciate including some of the multiple measures that we consider to be health-related in this broad system.

04:19:59.872 --> 04:20:00.733
We understand that there is a

04:20:03.439 --> 04:20:09.883
More discussion that is going to go on around ESSA and the state system and local measures.

04:20:11.043 --> 04:20:24.391
But we want to hopefully make sure and hope that you will ensure that key health measures continue to be part of whatever system as a key indicators, including and most importantly,

04:20:25.359 --> 04:20:28.341
suspension rates moving forward.

04:20:28.701 --> 04:20:45.850
Personally, I worked in the Oakland Unified School District for nine years and other districts for over a decade, worked in many underperforming schools and many performing schools, and that is the most important indicator to equity in underperforming schools and academic achievement, ultimately.

04:20:46.150 --> 04:20:46.410
Thank you.

04:20:50.598 --> 04:20:56.922
Okay, that concludes the public testimony, so now we are ready for board member comments.

04:20:57.022 --> 04:20:59.283
Carrick had a few clarifying comments.

04:20:59.323 --> 04:21:06.707
A few clarifying comments, and then we'll have board comments on the motion and any other issue the board wants to discuss.

04:21:07.108 --> 04:21:08.488
Just a few items.

04:21:08.548 --> 04:21:10.690
Carrick Ashley, Deputy Superintendent, CDE.

04:21:11.950 --> 04:21:17.514
Just thought it might save a couple questions to clarify a few things.

04:21:18.575 --> 04:21:28.165
First, it hasn't been talked about a lot, but we have made mention this time around of alternative schools and a system for alternative schools, which is coming.

04:21:29.607 --> 04:21:37.456
The governor's budget did include two positions for the Department of Education to work on that, and so we're in the process of advertising those positions.

04:21:37.876 --> 04:21:45.320
So, those discussions are coming, and we do appreciate the patience of those who probably could have come up and asked about it, but did not.

04:21:45.420 --> 04:21:46.560
So, I wanted to mention that.

04:21:47.421 --> 04:21:55.445
Two, the use of scores beyond just those who met standards or exceeded standards.

04:21:55.625 --> 04:22:00.628
Just to reiterate, that is the intention of where we're moving forward.

04:22:01.468 --> 04:22:04.350
We do want to move away from just looking at the kids on the bubble.

04:22:04.671 --> 04:22:06.972
We do want to look at the progress of all kids.

04:22:07.113 --> 04:22:10.115
Scale scores may be a good way of going about doing that.

04:22:10.856 --> 04:22:21.144
When it comes to a growth model, one of the things we'll want to get from you fairly soon is what you want that growth model to do for you.

04:22:21.744 --> 04:22:22.244
Right?

04:22:22.264 --> 04:22:29.129
Because getting that information will determine what models we would want to bring back to you and show you some data on.

04:22:29.530 --> 04:22:42.999
Because there are different ways of doing those models, and you may have heard in the 150 comments, the core districts early on talked a little bit about the system that they use, and they use a growth measure.

04:22:43.359 --> 04:22:50.304
And one of the things that was mentioned in that testimony was the use of some factors like poverty and

04:22:51.992 --> 04:22:56.979
English learner status and that sort of thing, which is one of the possibilities of doing that.

04:22:57.680 --> 04:23:06.451
But there are positives and negatives to what you include in that growth measure, and it all comes down to what it is you want to come out of that growth.

04:23:07.692 --> 04:23:22.277
So, we'll be bringing back to you, bringing to you, actually for the first time, for you to make, give us some comments and some, perhaps a recommendation from you as to what you want to see out of a growth measure so that we can bring back some models for you to consider.

04:23:23.057 --> 04:23:26.179
The third thing is that this is a system, again, that we're working on.

04:23:26.399 --> 04:23:34.184
There were some comments about the 5% of lowest-performing schools that ESSA requires us to identify.

04:23:35.265 --> 04:23:41.929
So we're building a system here for the 100%, because all schools can improve.

04:23:41.989 --> 04:23:44.811
This is a continuous improvement system for all schools to improve.

04:23:45.611 --> 04:23:46.612
At some point in time,

04:23:47.356 --> 04:24:13.809
uh... the first step here is to work on what the state wants to do with the state's local accountability system and these evaluation rubrics that apply to all and to apply to districts once we identify what it is we want to do as a state as we as we learn more about the federal law and the regulations that get approved we'll figure out in order to have a single system as as member uh... burr mentioned to have a single system will figure out how to use our system

04:24:14.569 --> 04:24:18.331
in a single way, in a single system, to identify those schools.

04:24:18.411 --> 04:24:22.753
But it's just a little premature to get into that conversation right now.

04:24:23.133 --> 04:24:40.422
And then lastly, I did want to make a mention that the workgroup for the English Learner Indicator, the folks have been identified for that workgroup and they'll be meeting coming up soon here in October and then there'll be an info memo or perhaps part of a board item we'll bring back for you.

04:24:41.229 --> 04:24:51.184
So hopefully maybe that answers a couple of questions and we can go from there.

04:24:51.304 --> 04:24:52.165
Okay, that's all done?

04:24:52.265 --> 04:24:53.227
All right, Bruce Holliday.

04:24:56.499 --> 04:24:59.841
We're not following a specific order about... No, this is wide open.

04:24:59.861 --> 04:25:07.305
I just have a short list of... All issues are on the table that we heard about the public comment and we heard before.

04:25:08.686 --> 04:25:16.670
First of all, I'd like to thank the core districts for being here today and for all the work they're doing in

04:25:18.818 --> 04:25:20.159
with evaluation and with data.

04:25:20.480 --> 04:25:28.890
I certainly hope that that work continues among the core district and that we are the beneficiary and all students in California are the beneficiary of that good work that you're doing.

04:25:30.251 --> 04:25:35.618
Many of the types of analyses that you're doing are really important and valuable and

04:25:36.258 --> 04:25:39.881
Who knows, we may be able to adopt those in years to come.

04:25:40.881 --> 04:25:44.304
So, stay the good course.

04:25:45.264 --> 04:25:49.267
I also want to thank PICO for being here today as well.

04:25:50.208 --> 04:26:03.537
I think there's a lot of great opportunity for organizations like PICO to disseminate information about how best to measure parent engagement, for example, or school climate.

04:26:05.390 --> 04:26:22.644
In the current rubric and action pieces that we're looking at today, repeatedly in the local measures, it says suggested possible ways of measuring will be developed in a number of those categories.

04:26:23.024 --> 04:26:29.029
Will we see examples of that by November in at least some of those categories?

04:26:30.888 --> 04:26:31.108
Yes.

04:26:31.308 --> 04:26:34.551
We have a couple that have started work already.

04:26:34.611 --> 04:26:42.838
The goal is to move them along the school climate and broader piece, for example, but then bring forward as those work groups.

04:26:42.878 --> 04:26:46.281
It'd be great to see at least some examples fairly soon on those.

04:26:46.701 --> 04:26:47.942
I think that would help a lot of people.

04:26:48.763 --> 04:26:53.887
But certainly, once again, groups like PICO could really be helpful in that regard as well.

04:26:55.148 --> 04:26:57.750
In terms of the alternative schools,

04:26:59.204 --> 04:27:05.128
hear very clearly that there is an alternative accountability system in the works or will be in the works soon.

04:27:05.528 --> 04:27:21.839
But in the meantime, I do think it would be very helpful for all of those alternative schools to have some clarity as to how in the interim they are supposed to respond to all of this or work through all of these pieces or so that a lot of

04:27:22.479 --> 04:27:26.100
needless worry and fear and consternation, it's not going to happen.

04:27:26.340 --> 04:27:29.221
So some clarity for them I think would be very, very helpful.

04:27:30.761 --> 04:27:39.644
In regards to the number of people who spoke today who talked about having a summary

04:27:42.608 --> 04:27:49.813
number, I guess, of some kind that would make it very easy for parents to compare one school to another.

04:27:49.833 --> 04:28:06.242
I just return to our roots again, where we came a long time ago, where it was pretty darn easy to hide a great deal of lack of performance behind one single number.

04:28:08.928 --> 04:28:11.929
The, what's easy is not always good.

04:28:12.510 --> 04:28:15.771
And in this case, I think easy can be really bad.

04:28:16.852 --> 04:28:25.176
I think it is, I think we saw today a dashboard, a look that is moving in the right direction.

04:28:25.196 --> 04:28:29.518
I apologize for my graphic artist comment last meeting.

04:28:30.118 --> 04:28:37.444
But I do think that we're getting close to making it easy for parents.

04:28:37.504 --> 04:28:38.105
I really do.

04:28:38.165 --> 04:28:48.733
I feel much more confident that we're going to get there and that they will be able to distinguish this school from that school in very important ways.

04:28:49.934 --> 04:28:56.456
what are children similar to my child accomplishing in this school versus that school?

04:28:56.796 --> 04:29:04.938
To me, that is the heart of school choice as opposed to how all kids are doing in that school, you know, the big number kind of thing.

04:29:05.319 --> 04:29:12.541
So once again, I caution us not to head back down that road because I do think that that can be very misleading.

04:29:12.561 --> 04:29:14.501
The 11th grade test

04:29:18.422 --> 04:29:33.153
question about having it be a part of the CCI, as we're calling it now, college and career readiness, and as well as a part of the academic indicator.

04:29:34.508 --> 04:29:38.631
I don't, I still can't wrap my head around why it can't be in both.

04:29:39.191 --> 04:29:51.619
I certainly understand how, certainly in the short run, maybe forever, having the 11th grade test be a part of the college and career indicator makes sense, makes a lot of sense.

04:29:52.160 --> 04:29:56.302
But at the same time, I don't like that it doesn't also appear over here.

04:29:56.322 --> 04:29:58.704
I don't see it as double counting.

04:29:58.864 --> 04:29:59.445
I really don't.

04:30:01.673 --> 04:30:03.076
But maybe somebody can explain that to me.

04:30:03.397 --> 04:30:08.548
So that's one thing that I've been thinking about.

04:30:11.832 --> 04:30:36.669
In regards to the encouragement to have first year interventions, more interventions early on, I do hope that the collaborative and the counties and even the state, if necessary, step up to helping aggressively, enthusiastically, right away, as soon as information.

04:30:36.929 --> 04:30:38.570
And I think that's what's happening.

04:30:38.590 --> 04:30:41.172
I think that that's the plan, even though it's not,

04:30:42.332 --> 04:30:44.093
written out that you have to do this and this.

04:30:44.133 --> 04:30:45.273
I think that's going to happen.

04:30:45.293 --> 04:30:46.574
I think it's in the spirit.

04:30:47.474 --> 04:30:49.615
And my last comment is along those lines.

04:30:52.256 --> 04:31:02.960
The conversations that we're having now in this room and that people are bringing into this room are so far different from what they were four or five years ago when I first came into this room.

04:31:04.198 --> 04:31:06.461
People are talking about data all the time.

04:31:06.721 --> 04:31:08.904
People are talking about equity all the time.

04:31:08.984 --> 04:31:18.796
People are talking about making sure that we see clearly what is happening in schools in all sorts of ways, and they are excited.

04:31:20.290 --> 04:31:21.690
to make change for the best.

04:31:22.271 --> 04:31:24.031
And that's huge.

04:31:24.391 --> 04:31:25.912
That is absolutely huge.

04:31:26.472 --> 04:31:41.176
And so I want to thank all the CDE staff, state board staff, the governor, the legislature, everyone who has, along with us, adhered not just to the law, but adhered to the spirit of LCFF.

04:31:41.757 --> 04:31:45.278
And today we get to pull it together and say,

04:31:46.598 --> 04:31:55.660
We stuck to our guns all the way through, and we believe that this is going to help close the achievement gap in the future.

04:31:56.120 --> 04:31:59.021
And I think it's good.

04:31:59.741 --> 04:31:59.921
Thank you.

04:31:59.941 --> 04:32:04.342
Well, that's a number of inquiries you should respond.

04:32:05.303 --> 04:32:06.823
Carrick's been taking a list, so.

04:32:08.483 --> 04:32:09.724
Some are on my list, so.

04:32:12.165 --> 04:32:16.028
Well, so a lot of those were comments more than questions.

04:32:16.068 --> 04:32:22.592
Yeah, the questions about the 11th grade, first year intervention, others.

04:32:22.893 --> 04:32:26.495
Do you want to just have everybody get their comments and then go back?

04:32:26.815 --> 04:32:28.437
Oh, go around and then come back.

04:32:28.797 --> 04:32:30.778
Feliza was next.

04:32:31.018 --> 04:32:31.999
Yeah, Feliza was next.

04:32:38.117 --> 04:32:44.020
So I also agree that I think we've come a long way from when I joined the the board last May.

04:32:45.141 --> 04:32:48.984
There's a couple of things that I want to agree with board member Holiday.

04:32:49.324 --> 04:32:55.588
One is the 11th grade making sure that it's part of the composite for college and career readiness but also standalone and we saw

04:32:56.808 --> 04:33:11.938
wide spectrum of stakeholders who also echo that and I think it's important for us to to understand that this is where we're at now with the accountability system but if there's some reoccurring themes that are coming up in the letters and the comments we should also pause and see is there merit in those.

04:33:12.858 --> 04:33:18.802
One of the things that since I started at the board have been one of my pretty much permanent talking points.

04:33:19.722 --> 04:33:20.323
Who wants to guess?

04:33:22.017 --> 04:33:23.777
Equity, achievement gaps, English learners.

04:33:25.318 --> 04:33:27.078
Oh, science, yeah.

04:33:27.178 --> 04:33:28.199
We'll leave that for my cousin.

04:33:28.939 --> 04:33:39.982
So what I want to say about the achievement gap is that I am still disappointed with this accountability system as it relates to a focus in narrowing achievement gaps.

04:33:40.382 --> 04:33:45.323
I understand that we have the growth and that's part of the methodology that we have.

04:33:45.823 --> 04:33:54.331
One of the metaphors that I use is if we're all rotating one chair to the right, I'm never going to sit next to Bruce Holiday.

04:33:55.272 --> 04:33:58.975
So yes, I may be moving, but I will never sit next to him.

04:33:59.376 --> 04:34:05.521
And so when we're looking at narrowing achievement gaps and we're looking at equity, that has to be actionable.

04:34:06.002 --> 04:34:11.187
It can't just be a word that we use to describe the lack of equity.

04:34:11.967 --> 04:34:16.051
or moving, we have an acknowledgment of equity, but how do we act towards it?

04:34:16.512 --> 04:34:24.480
When we look at the SBAC data, we see that there is growth, but we're not narrowing achievement gaps, right?

04:34:24.540 --> 04:34:30.806
And so we could look at English learners, and I heard the argument they only made a one-point gain for math.

04:34:31.246 --> 04:34:36.091
And so then the conversation kind of started with, well, this is a revolving door for students.

04:34:37.096 --> 04:34:37.937
That could be true.

04:34:38.157 --> 04:34:42.002
If you look at the group ELs, they're very heterogeneous.

04:34:42.082 --> 04:34:44.405
It's not one group of EL students.

04:34:44.865 --> 04:34:48.930
If you look at the long-term English learners, you will see that the majority are U.S.

04:34:48.970 --> 04:34:52.375
born and have started their schooling system in the U.S.

04:34:52.535 --> 04:34:52.955
in kinder.

04:34:54.537 --> 04:34:56.798
Is it really just a language thing?

04:34:57.318 --> 04:34:59.859
Could it be that we're not teaching to English learners?

04:34:59.899 --> 04:35:04.441
Could it be that the system may not be designed for these students in terms of what they're receiving?

04:35:04.841 --> 04:35:07.102
Are they receiving their designated EL time?

04:35:08.423 --> 04:35:09.523
Look at African Americans, 2%.

04:35:10.624 --> 04:35:12.724
Not much better than English learners.

04:35:12.804 --> 04:35:15.846
These students are still performing in the 16 to 18%.

04:35:17.186 --> 04:35:18.707
What's the reasoning there?

04:35:19.367 --> 04:35:20.287
Same group of students.

04:35:20.688 --> 04:35:22.408
They're not moving in and out of the category.

04:35:22.808 --> 04:35:23.649
Latino students.

04:35:24.489 --> 04:35:31.857
Let's look at Latino students not only because I'm Latina, but even if I wasn't Latina, Latinos are 53 percent of the state of California.

04:35:32.798 --> 04:35:33.239
53 percent.

04:35:33.379 --> 04:35:34.800
That's your future workforce.

04:35:35.481 --> 04:35:37.884
Those are, this is the majority of the state.

04:35:38.605 --> 04:35:39.986
53 in our public school system.

04:35:41.568 --> 04:35:44.931
Shouldn't we care a little more about these students?

04:35:45.925 --> 04:35:57.708
shouldn't we care if these students are actually making not only gains but accelerated gains because we our future as a state really depends on properly educating these students.

04:35:58.989 --> 04:36:03.290
So I want to see that more intentionally embedded into our accountability system.

04:36:03.650 --> 04:36:06.811
I think the LCAP template would be a good place for that because we're able to

04:36:07.851 --> 04:36:12.614
acknowledge there what we're going to do as districts to narrow achievement gaps.

04:36:12.894 --> 04:36:15.836
But it has to be a little bit more intentional than what we're doing right now.

04:36:16.457 --> 04:36:18.218
And I know that it didn't make the methodology.

04:36:18.318 --> 04:36:23.361
I thought that we would still be able to set targets that accelerated growth for some subgroups.

04:36:24.002 --> 04:36:27.985
And then I realized that, oh, well, that's not embedded into the methodology.

04:36:28.005 --> 04:36:28.865
It's just growth.

04:36:29.025 --> 04:36:29.265
Right.

04:36:30.006 --> 04:36:34.989
Which is still unclear to me how a subgroup in red, what is the goal to get to green?

04:36:35.289 --> 04:36:36.450
Is it 20 points?

04:36:36.790 --> 04:36:36.890
And

04:36:37.951 --> 04:36:42.133
Under LCFF, we have no state determined timeline to get to that green.

04:36:42.814 --> 04:36:52.839
And it's unclear to me if we're going to have targets that let the LEAs know, hey, you need 20 points for this subgroup, 15 points for this subgroup, and the clock starts now.

04:36:53.840 --> 04:37:08.824
there is no state determined timeline which will be incompatible with ESSA and I think that it's important for us to see how those two systems will merge when you have a state determined timeline for schools and you have some growth that has to take place but you don't have it for LCFF.

04:37:09.244 --> 04:37:17.147
So I know that we're moving toward one system but I think we really need to look at where are the points of misalignment because those will matter as well.

04:37:17.607 --> 04:37:21.868
When we say we're moving it to that one system we have to then reconcile

04:37:22.308 --> 04:37:24.609
where those points are not aligning.

04:37:24.829 --> 04:37:26.330
And that conversation has to happen.

04:37:26.670 --> 04:37:29.011
I know that the regulations are draft at this point.

04:37:30.491 --> 04:37:33.672
But they're also, some of them are making their way, I saw them in the ESSA state plan.

04:37:33.853 --> 04:37:38.694
Some of the regs that are still draft were cited there and decisions were made based on those draft regs.

04:37:39.115 --> 04:37:43.516
So if we're going to say we're pausing on the regulations, then we really need to pause.

04:37:43.916 --> 04:37:47.658
But we also need to consider, do we have a system with enough flexibility

04:37:48.078 --> 04:37:50.819
to adhere by the regulations once those are finalized.

04:37:51.699 --> 04:37:52.839
That may be at the end of the fall.

04:37:53.479 --> 04:37:55.540
Sure, things could change with the new administration.

04:37:55.560 --> 04:37:58.461
I could be deported even though I'm U.S.

04:37:58.501 --> 04:38:00.581
born with the new administration that's coming up.

04:38:00.921 --> 04:38:03.442
You know, knock on wood.

04:38:03.642 --> 04:38:07.143
So you'll have to Skype me in for some of these decisions.

04:38:08.463 --> 04:38:20.787
But again, I think it's important for us to really consider and have very honest conversations and push through the pain of saying, these are two systems that align very nicely in these ways, but do not align.

04:38:21.207 --> 04:38:27.189
And if we're going to keep it as one system, then let's be honest and unpackage that and say, this is what we need to do.

04:38:27.889 --> 04:38:28.189
Thank you.

04:38:29.070 --> 04:38:31.330
Okay, who's next?

04:38:32.651 --> 04:38:32.871
Trish.

04:38:32.891 --> 04:38:33.271
Trish Williams.

04:38:35.005 --> 04:38:39.529
I have a list, more like Bruce's, a shorter, longer list, but shorter.

04:38:39.549 --> 04:38:45.935
I do want to pick up before I start my list on what you just said about ELs and whether or not they're all the same.

04:38:45.955 --> 04:38:53.381
I understand the concept that they are learning English, and theoretically, when they are proficient, they go out.

04:38:54.142 --> 04:39:02.288
But so my background when I was executive director of EdSource was more research and data analysis in education.

04:39:02.348 --> 04:39:11.535
And so what your comments made me think of is the importance of even within a subgroup disaggregating

04:39:13.533 --> 04:39:15.134
the kinds of students in the subgroup.

04:39:15.214 --> 04:39:31.561
And I'm not like actually saying right now that we should be doing that, but I'm raising it as a question because if we're not seeing progress in subgroups, then we're probably not looking at them with as fine a grain as maybe we should.

04:39:32.461 --> 04:39:39.182
And I'm wondering if the same thing is also true of African Americans, for example.

04:39:39.342 --> 04:39:48.064
And if it's just that group, instead of, and I'm just raising this, okay?

04:39:48.364 --> 04:39:59.406
If it's just that group, but we're not disaggregating out low income from non-low income or parent education level, or males from females, because we know that there's a difference in accomplishment.

04:40:00.626 --> 04:40:20.533
there, then I'm just making the suggestion that maybe if to see progress and to accelerate progress in different groups, we probably might think about how we could look at them differently with a different look rather than just putting them all in a group.

04:40:21.153 --> 04:40:23.734
Okay, that's just a comment on your comment.

04:40:24.114 --> 04:40:26.975
I want to follow up on the career

04:40:27.815 --> 04:40:35.880
technical education and academic indicators and agree with many of you in the room that have said we need more balance there.

04:40:36.360 --> 04:40:50.289
I think it's really important that it not be all academic and A through G and test score that finding ways to have career technical education be a stronger part of that I think is really important.

04:40:52.330 --> 04:40:55.473
I also want to follow up on the year one assistance.

04:40:56.654 --> 04:41:08.543
I would like to hear the comment that we shouldn't, if we get numbers that show that there are schools or districts that are failing in many, many areas, we don't wait a year.

04:41:09.704 --> 04:41:36.595
If if CB and the county offices could get the direction that they in addition to whatever else they're trying to plan for the first year if they could also be ready to spot and act on Schools that are severely look like they're in severe trouble rather than waiting I think it's hard for us to justify waiting other than the fact that we don't have the capacity But kind of morally it's hard to justify it another one is

04:41:38.156 --> 04:41:44.130
school climate, in particular the woman that spoke on behalf of school psychologists.

04:41:45.890 --> 04:41:52.673
And in her letter, she mentioned that they didn't know that there's supposed to be a working group on school climate.

04:41:53.273 --> 04:41:58.415
And they don't see when that's posted and who's invited and they would like to be invited.

04:41:59.015 --> 04:42:08.459
I would like to say that I personally think that they would be an important person or important group and have important expertise to be at that kind of a meeting.

04:42:08.939 --> 04:42:10.780
And it's a different kind of expertise.

04:42:11.700 --> 04:42:19.264
So often when we're talking about school climate, we're talking about whether or not the school itself is friendly and supportive and kids feel safe there.

04:42:19.884 --> 04:42:33.131
But there's also an element of whether or not some of the students have backgrounds that are particularly troubling and struggling in their families or communities that cause them stress also at home.

04:42:33.532 --> 04:42:36.033
There are a lot of documented studies on this called

04:42:39.335 --> 04:42:41.918
adverse childhood experiences.

04:42:43.139 --> 04:42:49.846
Psychologists know how to look out for that and to look out for those kids and provide interventions for those kids in particular.

04:42:50.587 --> 04:42:52.709
I want to echo also member Holiday.

04:42:53.570 --> 04:43:00.799
about CORE and PACE and the work they're doing and that I hope it continues and that I hope we support it and that we learn from it.

04:43:01.220 --> 04:43:08.528
I think it's really important and it's a resource that we have here in California that probably few other states have and that we haven't had in the same way before.

04:43:10.911 --> 04:43:16.695
I want to say that I'm inclined to want to keep the suspension data.

04:43:17.276 --> 04:43:30.024
I understand that the research backs chronic absenteeism, and I think that chronic absenteeism is one kind of an indicator, but suspension data, I think, tends to

04:43:30.965 --> 04:43:41.872
And I don't have a resource that I can cite right now, but I think it tends often to happen more with African-American males.

04:43:43.053 --> 04:43:47.256
And that's a particular reason why we heard so many raise that as an issue.

04:43:47.416 --> 04:43:53.520
And it's well known that it's a pipeline to jail and prison when that happens.

04:43:53.880 --> 04:43:55.101
And so I do think it's important.

04:43:55.121 --> 04:43:56.582
I think we ought to consider keeping it.

04:43:59.241 --> 04:44:05.008
the issue about wanting a summary indicator in addition to the multiple indicators.

04:44:05.048 --> 04:44:10.075
That's one of the changes I heard in the public comment, is that we want both.

04:44:10.195 --> 04:44:15.482
We need some way to kind of know, to kind of more quickly figure things out.

04:44:17.904 --> 04:44:41.598
I would like to encourage that, to hear that as not necessarily meaning we have to have a summary indicator, but we need to hear what those parents are saying to us about how important it is to them and their communities to be able to feel like they are understanding what's going on in that school and whether or not it's the right school for their kids.

04:44:41.698 --> 04:44:43.740
I mean, the amount of parent commitment

04:44:44.600 --> 04:44:45.201
to their kids.

04:44:45.221 --> 04:44:46.682
I'm going to get a little stereotyped right now.

04:44:47.222 --> 04:44:51.166
The kind of parent commitment I just heard to their kids is just extraordinary.

04:44:51.286 --> 04:44:54.349
And they're asking to make sure that they have the kind of help they need.

04:44:54.709 --> 04:45:04.197
And if we keep that as the North Star, not necessarily get kind of freaked out over API, then we might be able to find ways to make that easier for them.

04:45:05.438 --> 04:45:08.700
The 11th grade test score, I agree.

04:45:09.020 --> 04:45:15.682
I'd like to see it in both places, and especially for small districts that might not have another one.

04:45:15.842 --> 04:45:23.565
Finally, my final one is with the charter schools and their request in both letters from Eric and from CCSA.

04:45:25.166 --> 04:45:26.127
We've talked about this.

04:45:26.207 --> 04:45:28.948
I don't think anything intentional has happened here.

04:45:29.449 --> 04:45:33.231
It's just that this has been such a big challenge for two years now.

04:45:33.811 --> 04:45:50.541
But we've talked repeatedly about the importance of indicating clearly in whatever reporting we're doing, whether that's directions on the LCAP or whether that's this kind of state reporting, in making it clear which indicators are not applicable

04:45:51.461 --> 04:45:57.586
to charter schools, certainly the Williams ones, and saying that specifically, not just saying not applicable.

04:45:58.606 --> 04:46:06.812
And, you know, the issue about what things are in the statute that apply to charters and which things are in LCFF that do or do not apply to charters.

04:46:07.633 --> 04:46:18.521
I had a brief conversation with David Sapp about that, and I'd like to ask him if he would just speak to that to make sure that, because you have like the language down and I don't have that down.

04:46:18.561 --> 04:46:20.082
And that's my, this is my last point.

04:46:21.407 --> 04:46:22.087
Okay, good.

04:46:22.207 --> 04:46:23.148
Who's next?

04:46:23.168 --> 04:46:30.129
Hi, David Sapp, Deputy Policy Director and Assistant Legal Counsel with the State Board.

04:46:30.609 --> 04:46:40.912
Just quickly on the question around charter schools, I think there have been several information memos that were posted earlier that sort of identified that there are certain indicators that don't apply by statute.

04:46:40.932 --> 04:46:44.033
This is a legal issue that don't apply by statute to charters.

04:46:44.793 --> 04:46:49.234
The one that was cited in the examples in the comment letters was priority one, the basics.

04:46:49.774 --> 04:46:55.620
which really just incorporates the Williams Settlement Agreement, that that's an example that's been referenced in prior materials.

04:46:55.700 --> 04:47:07.170
And so the recommended action before you today, the wording of the proposed standard for that local measure includes the word as applicable, and that was intended to capture that distinction.

04:47:07.210 --> 04:47:11.074
We understand the concern that it may not be clear in terms of how this thing gets implemented.

04:47:11.714 --> 04:47:24.482
And so that's something that at the staff level, we are committed to sort of meet with interested stakeholders, come back, provide an update to the board on this issue, and as appropriate, bring any recommended action to make it clearer.

04:47:25.362 --> 04:47:30.685
If we come back in November, there also will be the revised LCAP template that'll be before the board at that time.

04:47:31.166 --> 04:47:38.170
This same question about the instructions to the LCAP and greater clarity and specificity has been one that's come up several times.

04:47:38.530 --> 04:47:42.432
So we hope to be able to address both of those at the November meeting and make sure the language aligns.

04:47:43.173 --> 04:47:47.615
So you will be hearing more from us on this at the next board meeting.

04:47:47.635 --> 04:47:56.680
And I appreciate the fact that you're going to re-engage both of the charter organizations and whoever else is appropriate so that you work together and they feel comfortable with what we've done.

04:47:59.565 --> 04:48:03.146
Mike, may I add to this?

04:48:03.927 --> 04:48:14.091
The accountability system does not change the statute specifically about renewal of charters and authorizers renewal process.

04:48:15.491 --> 04:48:19.173
It does, the statute still places

04:48:20.553 --> 04:48:24.455
the most significant emphasis on academic achievement.

04:48:24.775 --> 04:48:30.918
And so authorizers need to understand that the renewal process has not changed because of this accountability system.

04:48:31.318 --> 04:48:33.999
Which means that it's not the other indicators.

04:48:34.099 --> 04:48:43.463
If there are problems with those other indicators, but the school is doing well academically, it's the academics that drive the renewal decision.

04:48:43.483 --> 04:48:49.486
Okay, Nikki.

04:48:50.831 --> 04:48:51.672
Board Member Sandoval.

04:48:52.112 --> 04:49:00.181
Thank you very much for your your excellent work and thank you to members of the public for just sticking with us through this process.

04:49:00.221 --> 04:49:02.863
I really appreciate all of your input.

04:49:03.284 --> 04:49:12.934
Yeah and I just have two questions and the first is really just I would appreciate a little bit more clarity about the content of the letter.

04:49:13.614 --> 04:49:32.604
that was referenced, year one, this idea of identifying strengths and weaknesses, and specifically, is it just going to focus on identifying strengths and weaknesses, or is it going to take it any further than that, requesting a response, or what are the action steps to address these shortcomings?

04:49:33.304 --> 04:49:35.725
And then the second question I have is just,

04:49:37.717 --> 04:49:45.724
I would also appreciate more clarity around the workgroups, the ones that are happening simultaneously through this process.

04:49:46.965 --> 04:49:56.193
Specifically, clarity about composition of the workgroups and then transparency of the process for members of the public.

04:50:00.436 --> 04:50:03.504
I heard questions about that, and I had questions myself about that.

04:50:03.684 --> 04:50:08.236
So those are the two areas that I'd appreciate more information on.

04:50:12.461 --> 04:50:12.822
Thank you.

04:50:13.162 --> 04:50:30.502
So the general theme as I'm listening to the public comments and comments from my fellow board members is that while we were generally very pleased with the architecture of this new accountability system under LCFF rubrics, that we are all recognizing that the instruments

04:50:31.823 --> 04:50:35.587
with which we are populating that architecture is still quite blunt.

04:50:36.308 --> 04:50:38.470
And it gets it to a lot of the equity issues.

04:50:38.490 --> 04:50:40.672
Are you really measuring what we really want to measure?

04:50:40.732 --> 04:50:42.494
Does it align with what we intend?

04:50:43.234 --> 04:50:50.181
And so my question is more around, you don't have to answer right now, you can save it till the end.

04:50:51.623 --> 04:51:06.283
While one of our items that we'll be approving is this annual update process, I feel like we need more, as we're designing this, we need more information rather than just an annual update type of where we're going.

04:51:07.524 --> 04:51:20.029
I just know that I remember, and whether the methodologies that we may be initially approving, at what point do we get enough information where we might decide that we're going to change it?

04:51:20.669 --> 04:51:32.754
And someone else had pointed out that we do have several groups who have been very invested in it, have done a lot of work on their own in trying to come up with some different models for us to consider.

04:51:33.434 --> 04:51:37.318
And it would, I think, behoove us to take a look at some of those things.

04:51:37.358 --> 04:51:49.168
And I remember in the development of the API, even, that when we first started with the API, we started with one methodology of developing the API.

04:51:49.528 --> 04:52:00.798
And then, when we started adding additional items into it, and then there were different grade level tests, that we decided to totally switch to a completely different methodology, which made much more sense.

04:52:01.178 --> 04:52:08.819
So I think this, I sense this iterative piece of how do we continue to refine these instruments that we have?

04:52:09.480 --> 04:52:17.221
And I do agree there's one where I am, I am concerned with the college and career readiness index right now.

04:52:17.261 --> 04:52:19.081
And are we ready for that?

04:52:19.241 --> 04:52:25.342
And if we're not technically sound with that, I would like to see the 11th grade pulled out as well.

04:52:25.363 --> 04:52:27.303
Because while conceptually it's great,

04:52:28.644 --> 04:52:46.780
if we can't really, if we're not really, if we don't have the information to appropriately, if that's appropriate for that, what we intend for that index, then the 11th grade scores, I do feel like also need to be pulled out.

04:52:46.840 --> 04:52:50.042
So those are just some of the things that I think we need to continue looking at.

04:52:50.062 --> 04:52:52.705
Okay.

04:52:54.646 --> 04:52:54.967
Suver?

04:52:56.343 --> 04:52:56.764
Thank you.

04:52:58.346 --> 04:53:00.669
I want to make a couple of comments and then I have some questions.

04:53:00.929 --> 04:53:07.718
The first is just with respect to how much, how soon about assistance, et cetera.

04:53:07.958 --> 04:53:12.945
One thing I forgot to mention in my opening comments is we still have not fully funded LCFF.

04:53:14.927 --> 04:53:16.548
We sort of lost track of this.

04:53:17.608 --> 04:53:20.730
Remember, the funding and the accountability are supposed to go together.

04:53:20.850 --> 04:53:28.673
Now, we are darn close, thanks to a very strong economy and tax revenues from Prop 30, but we are still not there yet.

04:53:29.694 --> 04:53:36.897
I don't want our expectations to get ahead of the resources we are providing the LEAs to actually do the work.

04:53:37.217 --> 04:53:38.958
I just want us to kind of keep that in mind.

04:53:40.238 --> 04:53:47.688
I also think that it's fair to give LEAs advance notice of what we're going to judge them on.

04:53:48.328 --> 04:53:49.570
And we're just now getting there.

04:53:49.750 --> 04:53:53.775
Today's the day, really, we hope, where we're going to say, here's where we start.

04:53:54.356 --> 04:53:55.838
We're going to be refining it over time.

04:53:56.458 --> 04:54:01.762
So, I, for one, don't have one bit of concern about the first year being, I'm going to send you a letter.

04:54:02.403 --> 04:54:13.771
Because if you look at, this is my big sort of bugaboo, the table that was in the memo I think Jenny put together for us about graduation requirements.

04:54:15.192 --> 04:54:18.135
UC requirements, CSU, there's a mismatch there.

04:54:18.775 --> 04:54:24.961
The state statutory requirements for graduation are much lower than what the admission requirements are.

04:54:25.622 --> 04:54:35.250
So there are districts out there that are going, hey, we're completely compliant with state statute, we're offering graduation courses, our kids are graduating, but guess what?

04:54:35.370 --> 04:54:37.212
They're not meeting those admissions.

04:54:37.672 --> 04:54:49.081
So, I think it's very fair and actually absolutely essential that we give LEAs the advance notice of saying, here's what your expectations are, and we're going to give you time to work up to it.

04:54:49.902 --> 04:54:54.826
It doesn't mean that if in the first year, you know, on a lot of the other indicators, everybody's in the red.

04:54:55.266 --> 04:55:01.111
Believe me, the counties, and I'll be happy to tell the counties this, they better be in there saying, you guys have got a problem.

04:55:01.671 --> 04:55:02.832
And we're going to have to help you.

04:55:02.872 --> 04:55:04.374
We're going to work right alongside you.

04:55:04.894 --> 04:55:10.399
I know that I, for one, and I'm guessing the superintendent as well, will be telling the CCEE the same message.

04:55:10.619 --> 04:55:11.120
Get on it.

04:55:11.800 --> 04:55:14.362
But again, let's just keep it in context.

04:55:14.543 --> 04:55:15.784
Have we fully funded them?

04:55:16.144 --> 04:55:19.887
Have we given them the appropriate advance notice of what we expect for them?

04:55:21.168 --> 04:55:31.752
I'm probably also going to be the one naysayer on grade 11, but I'm going to pose this as a question to Kerry because I think this is why we made the decision in the first place to pull it out.

04:55:32.572 --> 04:55:41.716
Grade 11, because there is no growth information, because there's no additional testing in high school, doesn't fit in a growth model.

04:55:42.236 --> 04:55:47.058
when you start to think about how do test scores, how do we use a growth model for test scores?

04:55:47.138 --> 04:56:03.184
So I just, I think maybe we need a fuller discussion about grade 11 and why we decided not to do double counting and also why it doesn't fit in a growth model as an academic indicator and why we thought it landed in the college and career indicator.

04:56:03.764 --> 04:56:05.565
So just want to talk a little bit about that.

04:56:07.446 --> 04:56:19.291
The two other things I want to mention is I think a lot of what we heard today, and I appreciate your comments, Member Williams, about being, you know, really trying to listen to what the parents were saying about a summative rating.

04:56:20.447 --> 04:56:41.802
To me, when I unpack that, there are many, many programs on the books, meaning the statutes, that are aligned to our old accountability system, such as the parent trigger legislation, that said if you are in decile, pick whatever the decile was, or your API score is such and such, you are subject to takeover.

04:56:41.822 --> 04:56:43.484
I mean, it was like an automatic trigger.

04:56:44.224 --> 04:56:56.133
And so folks are worried that if we don't align this new system with that, there won't be a way to have kind of the ultimate parent choice or the ultimate parent empowerment, if you will.

04:56:56.674 --> 04:57:07.983
So I think what I want to have a conversation about as we go along is what will be the work that we go forward to align our new system with those kinds of safeguards, if you will.

04:57:08.744 --> 04:57:10.727
And the question is, will we or won't we?

04:57:10.867 --> 04:57:12.489
If we do, what does it look like?

04:57:12.570 --> 04:57:18.759
So I just wanted to kind of also put those comments in context, because they weren't entirely clear about.

04:57:19.724 --> 04:57:21.705
what the underlying motivation was there.

04:57:22.766 --> 04:57:26.328
The last thing, and it sort of goes to the conversation about the achievement gap.

04:57:27.149 --> 04:57:32.552
I think the way I look at it, and this is where I want to, I emphasized at the beginning was this technical assistance piece.

04:57:33.012 --> 04:57:40.437
The way we're trying to get at equity, in addition to the transparency, is to say no subgroup can fail.

04:57:41.257 --> 04:57:47.601
Because any time a subgroup is failing on an academic achievement, they're gonna be kicked into technical assistance.

04:57:48.833 --> 04:57:50.694
and ultimately into intervention.

04:57:51.014 --> 04:57:54.336
And that's the piece that today we've really sort of started to talk about.

04:57:54.796 --> 04:57:57.998
So at least for me, that's a way to get at it.

04:57:58.078 --> 04:58:02.320
And in a way, to me, to be a lot more intentional about closing the achievement gap.

04:58:02.380 --> 04:58:07.402
It's just not acceptable to have the subgroups that we've identified not be successful.

04:58:07.862 --> 04:58:12.645
And so whoever is in there working alongside the LEAs is going to be focused on that.

04:58:13.445 --> 04:58:28.198
So, I just wanted you to comment a little bit on that and without getting into a big technical conversation about the way the distribution system works and how you use the lookup tables and, you know, when you're going to get to green, because all of that is in there.

04:58:28.678 --> 04:58:40.749
But, again, I think just the very simple definitions and the technical assistance about the conditions under which there will be support and assistance provided directly related to subgroup performance

04:58:41.209 --> 04:58:43.750
is like the neon light to me about equity.

04:58:43.770 --> 04:58:46.111
Okay, are we done?

04:58:46.191 --> 04:58:48.072
I have some comments, and Eileen.

04:58:51.153 --> 04:58:52.094
Yeah, she's on the list.

04:58:52.114 --> 04:58:53.094
Eileen and Pat.

04:59:02.560 --> 04:59:06.764
Yeah, we'll get to her.

04:59:07.265 --> 04:59:07.785
I want to share.

04:59:08.226 --> 04:59:25.783
OK, well, first of all, I want to echo my colleagues on the board and thanking everyone for taking the bus overnight up here, for coming, for all the ongoing work in the local communities, in the districts that really help inform our practice and really, in the end, are improving.

04:59:26.904 --> 04:59:33.228
support for kids in school so they get what they need so their future is bright and their opportunities are great.

04:59:33.648 --> 04:59:34.929
So I just want to thank everyone.

04:59:34.989 --> 04:59:46.135
I appreciate the information of the research groups, the PACE, the Learning Policy Institute, the CORE, all the people that are helping inform the reality of you have this theory but this is what it means for practice.

04:59:46.175 --> 04:59:49.117
So I hope that that will be an ongoing part of our work and that they

04:59:49.757 --> 04:59:54.180
will help inform, I appreciated their handouts, that they'll help inform our workgroups as well.

04:59:54.560 --> 05:00:02.206
So I have some asks actually for CDE, no surprise, about upcoming memos and work as you bring these workgroups together.

05:00:02.706 --> 05:00:12.453
So I know there's going to be the school conditions and climate workgroup and there's going to be work on the statements of model practices, which Nancy talked about and I did a little bit in the before.

05:00:13.534 --> 05:00:16.135
But as the timing works out, and I'm not sure

05:00:17.396 --> 05:00:31.887
once they meet, if they'll resolve, but an updated information memo, if we can get it before the November meeting or as they're ready, I think those information memos help front load for the community, for stakeholders, and for us, the work that they're thinking about.

05:00:31.947 --> 05:00:33.548
So that's one ask.

05:00:34.149 --> 05:00:39.473
Secondly, I think the technical design group is the one that advises CDE, but

05:00:40.354 --> 05:01:01.813
the CPAC is the one that's advising state board and they're very strong representation of practitioners who help think about how does this really work and what we heard from parents today and even practitioners we want so this is really interesting and these I didn't know about the Consumer Reports icons I thought that was actually oh this kind of looked interesting but basically is this working for districts?

05:01:01.953 --> 05:01:03.555
Are parents able to understand it?

05:01:03.575 --> 05:01:04.896
Does this help to inform

05:01:05.336 --> 05:01:17.070
So I would really like that as the work goes along with technical design, that we include the CPAG before our meetings to help, and I know you've got some meetings coming up with them, to help inform.

05:01:17.090 --> 05:01:23.377
I know, like, with the mock-up, the plan is to take it out to stakeholder groups and to ask, is this good?

05:01:23.417 --> 05:01:24.138
Are we getting there?

05:01:24.198 --> 05:01:26.560
I know the last one from the last meeting is gone now.

05:01:26.580 --> 05:01:27.641
Now we're on to the new one.

05:01:27.941 --> 05:01:31.024
But as Nancy kept saying, this is a mock-up to help you see it.

05:01:31.404 --> 05:01:35.187
So I would like us to be informed, what are stakeholders saying?

05:01:35.527 --> 05:01:36.548
Does this really work?

05:01:36.968 --> 05:01:38.069
Is it still too confusing?

05:01:38.089 --> 05:01:45.315
Because that's been, we've heard plus that we're moving along in the right direction, but minus that it's still a little too complicated to really be user-friendly.

05:01:45.395 --> 05:01:48.738
So as possible, if you could include

05:01:49.518 --> 05:01:51.620
the CPAG in this, this would be really helpful.

05:01:52.640 --> 05:02:10.232
Also, I really would like to look at the Smarter Balanced 11th grade and understand kind of real-time data because I think, and I'm not sure if I, and so maybe staff could clarify this, that the options of using it has to do with also a cohort data as far as when the kids finally graduate from high school

05:02:10.972 --> 05:02:12.373
if I'm clarifying that right.

05:02:12.454 --> 05:02:19.920
So I actually understand from measurement specialists that there is a way over time to do a growth measure from 8 to 11.

05:02:20.320 --> 05:02:25.144
And if that's true, I'd like for us to look at that as an option.

05:02:25.164 --> 05:02:31.189
I think it's not in the short term, but I think in the longer term that is an option and growth is an important issue for us.

05:02:31.929 --> 05:02:53.093
And then as you work on the broad course of study, which I think all of us share together, that that's really important that you bring us with the draft timeline, sort of information items as you're able to, because it does impact and help give messages to the field as well about what we think about as far as elementary, middle, and high school on.

05:02:53.633 --> 05:02:55.395
on broad courses study.

05:02:56.075 --> 05:03:04.263
And then an update on the plan alignment, which I know CD's been working really hard on and which I know is really complicated, but if we could have an update on that.

05:03:04.563 --> 05:03:12.390
And maybe that's a good CPAC thing as well, because they're the ones that actually live having to fill out all those forms and reports with their board.

05:03:12.950 --> 05:03:19.373
Maybe you could bring that to CPAC as well and have them kind of work some of that through and see if the alignment where we're going is making sense.

05:03:19.993 --> 05:03:24.395
So, with that, I'll end those comments and pass it to Michael.

05:03:24.455 --> 05:03:30.218
I'm wondering if we could have Deputy Superintendent Glenn Price talk a little bit about the work group.

05:03:30.598 --> 05:03:34.460
There were several questions about that and you want to wait?

05:03:34.600 --> 05:03:34.840
Okay.

05:03:34.900 --> 05:03:35.401
All right.

05:03:36.181 --> 05:03:38.162
Board Member Rucker.

05:03:41.670 --> 05:03:56.328
Well, first of all, I want to begin by thanking all of the stakeholders who took the time, whether they drove here for 15 minutes or they were on a bus for multiple hours to come here today to participate as stakeholders in this conversation.

05:03:56.708 --> 05:03:59.752
And I've appreciated every single time that we've heard from parents.

05:04:00.172 --> 05:04:10.257
that we've heard from teachers, school counselors, school administrators about the work that's being done in this process to create this accountability system.

05:04:10.697 --> 05:04:22.183
And even though you may individually be frustrated by the one minute of time that you personally had to speak, you use those single minutes very well to create an aggregate picture

05:04:22.643 --> 05:04:25.126
for the board about where your concerns were.

05:04:25.526 --> 05:04:30.330
And as a stakeholder group, we heard a great deal of consensus around a number of items.

05:04:30.410 --> 05:04:39.379
And you heard many of my colleagues on the board attempt to try to address some of those points that were repeatedly mentioned in your comments.

05:04:39.419 --> 05:04:48.047
So even though a minute may not seem like a lot of time, it was a powerful unit of time for giving the kind of feedback you gave because you were heard.

05:04:48.787 --> 05:05:01.596
I do want to turn the attention to some of the comments that have been made, and I always appreciate following the comments that were made by Board Member Burr, because she usually says many of the things that I want to say, and she says it better.

05:05:02.156 --> 05:05:10.622
But in talking about the growth model itself, I think the question that Carrick Ashley asked is very important.

05:05:11.102 --> 05:05:13.884
What is it that we want the growth model to do?

05:05:14.564 --> 05:05:26.949
Because some of the things that we are being asked to consider are incompatible with some of the desires that you have asked to be baked in to the design of the growth model.

05:05:27.469 --> 05:05:39.494
So I think that, Kerrick, in asking us about the growth model, it may be a good idea, but in order for us to give you an informed answer, to understand how growth models work.

05:05:40.114 --> 05:05:58.525
and how they use the different factors that can be developed in a growth model, weighting the academic factors and the other factors that are considered, you know, whether regression model or any of those other types of ways that data is actually analyzed in a growth model, how it would work.

05:05:59.065 --> 05:06:14.277
Because if we actually are looking at a growth model, then the grade 11 Smarter Balanced assessment being included in the way that's being suggested is incompatible with any current type of growth model that I'm aware of.

05:06:14.757 --> 05:06:23.004
And so if there is a desire to include that single data point that doesn't work in current growth models, then we need to understand

05:06:23.764 --> 05:06:41.555
What in what way it could work because those two things are kind of incompatible with what the intent of a growth model is The second point again concerning the growth model is to understand not just what it is we how it is we want the growth model to operate to analyze the data and

05:06:41.895 --> 05:06:45.077
and to weight all of those factors to create the single system.

05:06:45.518 --> 05:07:02.929
But then for the parents and the teachers and the other stakeholders who came here to say, we want it to give us data about our schools, then it's not just how we want the growth model to do the analysis, but what kind of information the model then turns around and tells schools.

05:07:02.949 --> 05:07:07.873
And I'll give a very concrete example because I heard this very clearly from a number of parents.

05:07:08.593 --> 05:07:14.243
It's one thing to be in a flagship school district where a number of students are doing very, very well.

05:07:14.972 --> 05:07:21.096
But if my child who is African-American is still not doing well, we still have an achievement gap.

05:07:21.797 --> 05:07:44.632
So how do you, in a single school district, hold the district accountable for the fact that you have a flagship school that offers the A to G curriculum for every single student in the school who wants it, that has multiple AP courses, that teaches six or seven different foreign languages, yet in the same district, you have a school that is failing

05:07:45.552 --> 05:08:05.437
How do you hold the district accountable for the failure of that school in isolation if you are not providing some way for schools to be compared and so that parents can understand not just whether or not my school is making gains or whether the students in the school my child is attending is making gains,

05:08:05.817 --> 05:08:13.424
but is the district being held accountable for the difference of the performance of that school when you compare it just with schools within the district?

05:08:13.845 --> 05:08:31.501
Because let me be real clear, in districts where that kind of glaring achievement is happening, it is because the district has made a conscious decision to spend money differently for one school program than they do for another school program, and to do planning for improving in that school differently.

05:08:31.881 --> 05:08:49.470
So, they want to understand how is the data going to hold the district accountable to do something different for the school that's not doing well relative just to the performance of other schools in their district, let alone if we figure out some way to compare schools in other districts.

05:08:49.490 --> 05:08:51.211
So, that's what I heard.

05:08:51.952 --> 05:08:55.934
But then, when we talk about the fact that equity is on the table,

05:08:56.806 --> 05:09:02.451
Putting equity on the table is not the same as discussing race.

05:09:02.971 --> 05:09:20.565
And we have to be very careful that we start not trying to quantify in this accountability system other cultural factors, those things that I heard the school psychologists say are protective and resilient factors that we currently don't quantify.

05:09:21.005 --> 05:09:24.248
Whether the parents had the level of education of the parents,

05:09:24.648 --> 05:09:27.429
the engagement of parents, gender and ethnicity.

05:09:27.929 --> 05:09:30.449
Those don't become racial issues.

05:09:30.930 --> 05:09:32.990
Those become racist issues.

05:09:33.030 --> 05:09:44.973
So we have to be very careful how we talk about that kind of data and how we choose to quantify or weight it in this system because that's not what we asked the growth model to do.

05:09:45.413 --> 05:09:48.574
That's not currently what the statute has tasked us to do.

05:09:49.214 --> 05:10:04.477
And even though this may be a conversation of merit, it's also rife with peril because we don't have the current expertise or the statistical models to build into a state accountability system to make a conversation like that work.

05:10:04.817 --> 05:10:13.479
So equity and racial issues and race issues are several different factors that were not intended

05:10:14.039 --> 05:10:16.601
for us, that's a rabbit hole we really weren't intended to go down.

05:10:17.242 --> 05:10:35.057
But in looking at that, I do want to say that there is a particular group that even though they are, according to the data, one of the best performing subgroups, we do have within that community many different communities that are saying we do need to disaggregate data about them.

05:10:35.398 --> 05:10:37.960
And I'm talking particularly about Asian students.

05:10:38.360 --> 05:10:56.644
We have a lot of communities that represent many different subcultures and subgroups of Asian students who are saying their students disappear in this statewide data when Asian students are clustered as a monolith into one subgroup and into one category.

05:10:57.044 --> 05:11:03.326
So if we're going to have a conversation not about whether it's income level or not about whether it's race

05:11:03.846 --> 05:11:25.204
or whether the parents have attained a certain high school education or a certain education level, we do need to think about how the growth model serves that particular community or does a disservice to that community by painting all the students we place into that subgroup with one broad stroke, because they have raised some issues that are very valid,

05:11:25.544 --> 05:11:39.016
about the differences in performance among those students and it's not about ethnicity or even culture, it's even down to the language that those students speak and the differences in the language development needs that those students have in that subgroup.

05:11:39.316 --> 05:11:43.500
But again, we're not tasked to do that and we're not asked to do that.

05:11:43.960 --> 05:11:46.523
So I think it's great that we have come to a point

05:11:46.983 --> 05:11:59.326
where we are creating a mental model about how this system can work because it's been two years in the making and every single time I come to the board meeting, I leave with a different idea about what we're going to attempt to do.

05:11:59.927 --> 05:12:16.191
But today, I actually have and I heard among all the stakeholders some very concrete concerns, not about just the construction of what's reported and what the public sees as a consumer, but what the outcome or what the information

05:12:16.651 --> 05:12:18.172
that the report should give.

05:12:18.252 --> 05:12:36.042
So I'm hoping, rather than getting into the weeds about how we develop the colors and how the report finally looks from the graphic artist standard, but that we think about when the public begins to use and see this, that we have some ways of differentiating

05:12:36.562 --> 05:12:42.326
the kind of data outcomes or the kind of data information they're asking the system to report.

05:12:42.766 --> 05:12:58.718
So to recap, we have, we're at the cusp of creating this growth model, and I think it is important for us to be clear on what we're asking the growth model to do, and that we can form our recommendations for adding new data points to that growth model based on that.

05:12:59.258 --> 05:13:16.786
And so at this point, I also have to concur with Board Member Burr, based on what we have currently said the growth model is supposed to do, I do not believe adding back in the grade 11-S back in the way that you've asked for it is compatible with the growth model that we said we wanted to develop.

05:13:17.166 --> 05:13:25.430
So if there's something different we need to do, then we actually need to have some people explain to us what a growth model is and how it can operate.

05:13:26.130 --> 05:13:30.131
Second point, it's not just creating the report.

05:13:30.191 --> 05:13:32.052
It's not just building the engine.

05:13:32.452 --> 05:13:35.293
It's looking at what the output is going to be.

05:13:35.333 --> 05:13:42.015
So now that you're done building the engine and now that you've identified what the component parts are, what's it going to look like?

05:13:42.495 --> 05:13:45.338
So what do I get to enjoy about it?

05:13:45.398 --> 05:13:48.000
That's what parents came here today and really said.

05:13:48.500 --> 05:13:59.370
They weren't just saying, the reason why they asked for a single composite number is because they don't trust that the information that's being presented to them will be given back to them in a consumable way.

05:13:59.890 --> 05:14:07.437
So it's not just enough to have a growth model that works, to have a perfect design that works, but to give it to them in a consumable way.

05:14:08.348 --> 05:14:23.184
And then finally, in talking about the charter schools and the Williams piece, I seem to recall when we first started looking at how to incorporate the Williams elements, my specific question was, well, why are we calling them the Williams elements?

05:14:23.625 --> 05:14:30.392
Because there are some things that would be common in the intent of what we're trying to do with the LCAP rubric.

05:14:30.772 --> 05:14:34.395
that clearly should be a requirement for all schools.

05:14:34.775 --> 05:14:45.483
So why are we going to list them in the group of eight state priorities as the Williams elements knowing clearly there's a subset of schools that are not required to meet those requirements?

05:14:45.883 --> 05:14:49.506
Why are we not parsing out and identifying all of those common elements?

05:14:49.546 --> 05:14:57.512
So I understand you took the step of adding the parenthetical if applicable, but that was not the motion I voted for.

05:14:58.362 --> 05:15:04.486
And so I want to be real clear that it is a change from the motion that was originally adopted.

05:15:06.147 --> 05:15:10.850
If that's what the motion is today, that's not the motion I originally voted for.

05:15:10.890 --> 05:15:16.214
So I need some clarification about what that parenthetical, if applicable, means.

05:15:16.614 --> 05:15:23.038
Because I'm very concerned now that it is different from what I thought I was voting for when we originally had this conversation.

05:15:24.899 --> 05:15:26.420
OK, so I'll make two brief comments.

05:15:26.480 --> 05:15:26.700
Olivia.

05:15:27.101 --> 05:15:27.701
Oh, Olivia.

05:15:31.618 --> 05:15:35.023
First of all I just want to say thank you to everyone who voiced their opinions today.

05:15:35.043 --> 05:15:46.820
It really means a lot as a student to hear so many people from all over the state come and voice their opinions about how to make my education and all the other students education in California better so I really appreciate that.

05:15:47.842 --> 05:16:01.897
Speaking about the 11th grade testing, because I personally have taken those tests and I feel sort of hesitant about wanting to place so much importance on it and putting it, definitely putting it into two indexes if that's what we decide to do.

05:16:03.518 --> 05:16:07.840
Because the test is unlike any other test that I've ever had to take during school.

05:16:08.200 --> 05:16:26.188
By placing so much importance on the single test and by ranking high schools a large majority of the, or not a majority, but a large percentage of the accountability index would be based off of this, there's really no practice that I was able to have or that any student was able to have in order to take the test.

05:16:26.708 --> 05:16:29.129
The first time that we saw it was the first time that we actually took it.

05:16:29.529 --> 05:16:34.437
So I believe that if it's so important, we should be placing more preparation into it.

05:16:34.477 --> 05:16:41.748
And also, in addition to letting the students know how important it is, when we came in to take the test, it felt just like, like any other thing.

05:16:41.788 --> 05:16:43.331
And our teachers were even sort of

05:16:45.714 --> 05:16:50.157
hesitant that it was taking so much time away from the education that they were trying to teach us.

05:16:50.337 --> 05:17:03.426
So if this is so important, we should be allowing, we should be telling students exactly how important it is and the fact that they need to take this very seriously if it's going to be such a large component of how their schools are going to be graded.

05:17:05.754 --> 05:17:06.775
Okay, good point.

05:17:07.375 --> 05:17:18.385
So I just have two comments and nothing for your list, but tomorrow we will hear more about the CAS scores.

05:17:20.027 --> 05:17:25.311
We had testimony from Linda Kaminsky, who is superintendent in San Gabriel Valley.

05:17:26.332 --> 05:17:26.632
Pardon?

05:17:27.673 --> 05:17:29.475
Azusa in the San Gabriel Valley.

05:17:30.215 --> 05:17:33.178
And I agree with virtually every word she said.

05:17:36.060 --> 05:17:44.988
Now that we're getting more years of data, we need to get beyond the NCLB trap of everything is what level you're at.

05:17:46.649 --> 05:17:55.636
And that it's all about how many are over level three and no interest at all in how people are doing at lower levels and making gains.

05:17:57.037 --> 05:18:04.682
So we need to move beyond NCLB thinking, and the scale scores are one possible way to do that.

05:18:05.342 --> 05:18:07.944
The CDE has been working on this.

05:18:08.564 --> 05:18:10.806
Carrick and Michelle have been working on this.

05:18:10.866 --> 05:18:18.991
So I think that's something we need to really keep in mind, that we need a much more robust use of these assessments.

05:18:19.571 --> 05:18:21.252
I mean, we paid, the U.S.

05:18:21.312 --> 05:18:22.433
government paid $180 million to formulate them,

05:18:24.494 --> 05:18:26.615
They're very, very good and what are we getting?

05:18:26.735 --> 05:18:27.475
Four levels.

05:18:27.616 --> 05:18:33.939
I mean, you know, so we need to move beyond this and we're on the same page with CDE on that.

05:18:35.099 --> 05:18:42.103
Again, my biggest comment is and I think we'll be able to take up some of this in later on or in the federal aid.

05:18:43.083 --> 05:18:48.866
A very brilliant Harvard professor who I worked with over the years was Richard Elmore and he had a law

05:18:49.861 --> 05:18:50.741
which I agree with.

05:18:52.042 --> 05:19:00.405
Elmore's law is as you ratchet up accountability, you have to ratchet up the capacity of schools and districts to meet that accountability.

05:19:01.205 --> 05:19:05.967
The theory of action today in this discussion on change is it's all about accountability.

05:19:06.227 --> 05:19:15.631
That's the only way we're going to help schools and somehow Carl Cohn's going to be a magician and be able to prepare teachers that are struggling with math overnight.

05:19:16.371 --> 05:19:17.311
So this is one

05:19:20.153 --> 05:19:23.115
a thing in your arsenal, accountability.

05:19:23.615 --> 05:19:31.559
We have never talked on this board, just because we're overwhelmed with accountability, about our strategy for building capacity.

05:19:32.179 --> 05:19:34.940
We laid out 1.2 million or 4 million

05:19:36.221 --> 05:19:37.302
for Common Core.

05:19:37.382 --> 05:19:40.464
We talked about the need for teachers now.

05:19:40.684 --> 05:19:44.586
I think our results clearly show we have some major problems in mathematics.

05:19:45.106 --> 05:19:53.612
I don't think tough-edged accountability is going to transform overnight the account of the ability of elementary teachers to teach mathematics.

05:19:54.452 --> 05:20:01.855
So the board, at some point, has to move from the back end of its education policy to the front end in capacity.

05:20:02.515 --> 05:20:10.778
And so you have in... that, I think, is something we need to... because our agenda, to me, is imbalanced, really.

05:20:10.898 --> 05:20:17.220
And it's not our fault and it isn't the fault of... it's just the way we have had to schedule things.

05:20:17.280 --> 05:20:21.302
But I don't want to lose track of this balance.

05:20:22.342 --> 05:20:26.864
The federal law, I think, gives us some opportunities to work again on this capacity building.

05:20:28.085 --> 05:20:32.026
And I think that's one of the strategic issues we'll want to take up in that.

05:20:32.547 --> 05:20:35.108
So those are comments, not questions.

05:20:35.188 --> 05:20:39.330
So I don't know how you're going to organize your response, but here it is.

05:20:39.450 --> 05:20:43.571
So here's your list, yeah.

05:20:43.691 --> 05:20:47.113
We have some answers and some additional questions, but we'll start with Glenn.

05:20:48.428 --> 05:20:50.909
Good afternoon board members, Glenn Price, Chief Deputy.

05:20:50.929 --> 05:20:55.932
I wanted to briefly comment on three of the items that came up in comments and your questions.

05:20:56.072 --> 05:21:05.416
One is the school conditions and climate work group, two would be the statements of model practice, and three being the issue of plan alignment.

05:21:06.076 --> 05:21:17.207
First of all, on the school conditions and climate work group, I want to really thank you for charging the department with forming this group and let you know that I have the honor of being the lead facilitator for the group.

05:21:17.267 --> 05:21:25.294
And it's been really exciting work so far as we've worked with our department staff, with state board staff, and we've been supported by WestEd as well.

05:21:25.334 --> 05:21:30.499
And we've been able to bring together a lot of great resources to support the work.

05:21:31.119 --> 05:21:39.365
As you can imagine, there's been a tremendous amount of interest from people around the state wanting to get involved in the work of the School Conditions and Climate Work Group.

05:21:39.445 --> 05:21:47.690
And we're working hard to maximize engagement and speed and product at the same time.

05:21:47.710 --> 05:21:51.292
So we're looking at kind of three levels of engagement in the work group.

05:21:51.792 --> 05:22:00.218
One level is a small working group of 11 people that we're putting together to do some of the heavy lifting on analyzing the research that you've charged us with.

05:22:00.758 --> 05:22:17.105
At a second tier, we're going to be putting together a list of all the people that have contacted us and responded to be a resource team for the work that we can go out to with requests for support going forward for the work group.

05:22:17.445 --> 05:22:27.829
And then thirdly, we're going to be doing a series of in-person stakeholder meetings, which will be basically an open invitation for anyone in the state who would like to come in and help support this work.

05:22:28.749 --> 05:22:33.350
different tiers of work going forward and very exciting so far.

05:22:33.871 --> 05:22:41.773
And I think we're working towards the deadline of wanting to come back to you in January 2017.

05:22:42.313 --> 05:22:54.037
So for your January meeting, we want to be able to come back to you with some recommendations around school conditions and climate, which clearly is a really critical part of the accountability and continuous improvement system going forward.

05:22:54.697 --> 05:22:57.419
So that's school conditions and climate work group.

05:22:58.140 --> 05:23:19.396
On the statements of model practice, you may recall that I've spoken a couple times about this LCAP support team that we put together inside of the Department of Education, which is a horizontal team that draws from all of our divisions to think about how we can best be reorganizing to support the work in LCFF and the development, implementation, and evaluation of local control and accountability plans.

05:23:20.136 --> 05:23:29.959
The members of that team, as one of their tasks, have been tasked with the curation of high quality resources in relationship to the priority where they have expertise in.

05:23:29.999 --> 05:23:37.621
So they've been putting that together, reviewing those resources, and we want to make them available in relationship to the statements of model practice.

05:23:38.121 --> 05:23:47.103
The other work that they're doing, and this will transform, obviously, as we move forward with the critical work of transforming and bringing to you the new LCAP template,

05:23:47.839 --> 05:23:56.185
in November is looking around the state and finding samples of excellence in practice within existing LCAPs in relationship to priorities.

05:23:56.205 --> 05:24:15.400
So we'll be able to, as part of the statements of model practice, articulate what is the model practice that we're shooting for, what are some curated resources that we can make available that would help support the realization of that model practice, and how are some people around the state doing that would be some of the key resources that we're

05:24:15.700 --> 05:24:19.244
we're working on to be making available there as part of the statement.

05:24:19.284 --> 05:24:31.316
So Board Member Strauss and everyone, we anticipate very quickly being able to come back with a memo to you about how that work is progressing and make that so you can provide input and guidance to us as we move along.

05:24:32.517 --> 05:24:45.664
On plan integration, we've talked about that quite a bit, and I'm glad Brooks is in the room because I know he's promised to throw us a ticker tape parade if we are successful in integrating the LEA plan and the LCAP.

05:24:48.685 --> 05:25:06.330
People around the state are very excited about that possibility, and I just wanted to recall for all of us that when the Christmas miracle occurred and ESSA was adopted and signed by the President, and then the Department of Education asked for states that didn't currently have waivers

05:25:06.710 --> 05:25:11.432
to come in with a transition plan about how to move beyond the implementation of SES.

05:25:11.792 --> 05:25:25.638
California responded, and as part of that transition plan, we indicated that moving forward, the LEA plan would be our existing LCAP, the State of California's LCAP, plus the consolidated application.

05:25:25.698 --> 05:25:26.719
So we're already having

05:25:27.179 --> 05:25:29.441
a level of integration happening in the state.

05:25:30.001 --> 05:25:46.651
Meanwhile, staff is working hard on the details of how we can move that forward in a more comprehensive and elegant way as we think about this new LCAP template that we're working on and how that can then become and serve the purposes of a vibrant LEA plan for the state.

05:25:47.352 --> 05:25:51.915
So that's kind of a little status report on those three areas, school conditions and climate work group.

05:25:52.815 --> 05:25:54.836
plan alignment, and statements of model practice.

05:25:54.856 --> 05:25:59.157
I don't know if there's further questions or comments or guidance.

05:26:03.358 --> 05:26:03.458
Okay.

05:26:10.681 --> 05:26:13.842
So let me start with just a comment on the summative rating.

05:26:15.928 --> 05:26:24.153
I think what we clearly heard this morning to this afternoon is that there needs to be some clarity.

05:26:24.413 --> 05:26:28.235
It needs to be a system that is easily read and understood.

05:26:28.255 --> 05:26:37.081
The one concern that I heard in those comments

05:26:38.169 --> 05:26:53.383
was the use of that summative rating for comparison purposes, which pulled it right back to I want a single indicator, number, color, whatever it is, so that I can compare it to another one

05:26:54.412 --> 05:27:20.414
school that has a single composite number or again kind of simplifying the whole process and simple is not necessarily good as member holiday said so um but i think the takeaway is we need to make it clear and understandable and um and usable for parents and i think that that can be done with or without a summative rating

05:27:21.209 --> 05:27:44.235
When it comes to 11th grade test scores, let me start by saying that the comments that Member Burr and Member Rucker both said are accurate in terms of growth models and how we're going to use it in the future, what we're going to do with our grades three through eight.

05:27:45.235 --> 05:27:49.196
It's not that a growth model is not possible to do with 11th grade.

05:27:50.416 --> 05:27:52.858
but the most recent score is from 8th grade.

05:27:53.419 --> 05:27:59.383
So the students who took it for the first time in 8th grade then just took it for a second time in 9th grade.

05:27:59.984 --> 05:28:09.912
So they'll still have to take it as 10th graders and then as 11th graders before we can compare their scores from 8th grade to 11th grade in terms of a cohort growth model.

05:28:10.352 --> 05:28:14.276
But I have brought with me today

05:28:15.897 --> 05:28:17.558
Tony Alpert from Smarter Balanced.

05:28:17.578 --> 05:28:42.474
I thought it might be helpful to bring him up and have him talk just a little bit about what states in general are doing about these growth models specifically and maybe specifically what they're doing between eighth grade and 11th grade or what their plans are in the future just to give you a comparison of where we are versus some other states and what we should be doing and what we should be thinking about

05:28:42.754 --> 05:28:45.315
between now and implementing a growth model.

05:28:45.355 --> 05:28:46.056
So, Tony Albert.

05:28:55.440 --> 05:28:55.680
Hello.

05:28:56.060 --> 05:28:58.861
For the record, Tony Albert, Executive Director of Smarter Balanced.

05:28:59.302 --> 05:29:02.623
So, every state is struggling with this issue.

05:29:02.703 --> 05:29:10.347
They're struggling with how to create an accountability system that meets their policy objectives,

05:29:12.509 --> 05:29:26.726
describes these complex systems, educational systems, in an easy-to-understand manner for something that isn't easy to understand, and trying to incorporate a lot of different data elements around status as well as growth.

05:29:27.347 --> 05:29:30.070
And so, California is not unique in that regard.

05:29:31.010 --> 05:29:47.734
What the consortium has tried to do is provide some comprehensive technical assistance in assisting the departments of education in having conversations with boards such as your own so that they can start chipping away at some of the core decisions.

05:29:47.834 --> 05:29:57.417
So for instance, a critical decision regarding a growth model is what growth is expected for students who have already met or exceeded the achievement standard.

05:29:58.437 --> 05:29:59.679
That's pretty significant.

05:30:00.079 --> 05:30:17.180
That is a very significant policy decision about the role of the state in setting expectations for students who are already high achieving and it has implications for accountability systems and the emphasis of instruction and it's a very goal driven

05:30:18.161 --> 05:30:24.386
critical issue, a core issue around a growth model, and that's something that a policy board really needs to establish.

05:30:24.446 --> 05:30:38.119
And there's lots of different ways that growth models can address a core issue like that, and there isn't, as far as we know, there isn't a right answer, that there's some answers that may be more preferable than others.

05:30:40.881 --> 05:30:44.844
There may be some wrong answers, but we don't know of any right answers yet.

05:30:45.825 --> 05:31:03.039
Helping the departments of education across the nation understand some of those critical levers, and I believe ETS in their presentation talked about some of those different levers that the board might use to achieve their policy objectives.

05:31:04.140 --> 05:31:18.529
And, as Mike described, states are trying to broaden their use of these assessment scores to include scale scores in addition to achievement levels, and that can be part of the measurement properties.

05:31:18.630 --> 05:31:20.591
It can also be part of the reporting properties.

05:31:20.991 --> 05:31:29.677
So those are some different decisions that I think you're also struggling with, is that you can have a model that uses some different metrics.

05:31:29.717 --> 05:31:34.100
You can also report that in tabular form, in graphical form.

05:31:34.140 --> 05:31:38.703
So very complex issues that everyone is struggling with.

05:31:38.823 --> 05:31:47.889
So I can answer any specific questions that you have about that, but at least wanted to give you that context, and hopefully you find it helpful.

05:31:51.244 --> 05:31:51.783
Yeah, go ahead.

05:31:53.234 --> 05:32:02.056
So the actual decision about standards or performance cut points for test scores really has been deferred to November, as I recall.

05:32:02.076 --> 05:32:03.196
I'm looking at Dave, right?

05:32:03.636 --> 05:32:08.897
So we're going to have this conversation in a lot more detail when we make that decision in November.

05:32:10.217 --> 05:32:17.678
So I appreciate the initial information, but I think we're going to kind of, we're sort of on overload, I'm guessing, at the moment.

05:32:19.138 --> 05:32:21.899
So we can have that conversation in more detail.

05:32:22.219 --> 05:32:36.989
But I think that what I heard a lot of other people concerned with is if we were to move forward with our motion, the motion would have grade 11 be counted in the college and career indicator right now.

05:32:37.929 --> 05:32:40.472
So that's just for people who raised concerns before.

05:32:41.793 --> 05:32:52.803
My personal feeling is we could take action on it the way it is now, then in November if we come back and go, no, there really is a way and it makes sense to do it both ways, we could modify going forward.

05:32:53.183 --> 05:33:01.270
But we would satisfy needing to adopt the standards that we need to and the evaluation rubrics today in order to meet our deadline.

05:33:01.351 --> 05:33:02.872
So just for clarification.

05:33:07.810 --> 05:33:08.382
Yeah, go ahead.

05:33:10.151 --> 05:33:16.375
The current motion does include cut scores though for progress of English learners, high school graduation and college and career readiness.

05:33:16.655 --> 05:33:19.557
The only ones for November would be test scores, right?

05:33:20.678 --> 05:33:25.121
But in the motion we don't have anything about when to revisit the cut scores.

05:33:25.982 --> 05:33:37.309
I think that again theoretically as people get more comfortable with the indicators and they start aligning their resources, perhaps some of these cut scores will see them change a bit.

05:33:37.389 --> 05:33:39.491
And so at what point do we come back

05:33:40.191 --> 05:33:49.476
for this and for the SBAC cut scores and revisit those and see is this still an appropriate cut score that's not included in this motion.

05:33:49.636 --> 05:33:57.780
We're part of a consortium so I think a consortium should answer.

05:33:59.401 --> 05:34:03.703
As part of the direction to staff let's see if I can

05:34:04.804 --> 05:34:23.056
Yeah on the motion number six here that says approve the proposed annual process for state board to review the evaluation rubrics this sort of goes to member Ting's comment earlier that needs to be more elaborated

05:34:23.396 --> 05:34:46.264
But the idea on that is that came up really at a prior meeting, the capacity for the board, particularly in these first years of implementation, as more data comes in, as there's a sense from the field, particularly this first year, as they're using the rubrics, the design of determining, for example, a growth model,

05:34:46.724 --> 05:34:54.069
I mean that would be on an annual basis that would need to be more elaborated as to what the process would be.

05:34:54.129 --> 05:35:03.216
That's a perfect example of how that needs to occur initially because we know chronic absenteeism will be coming online.

05:35:03.616 --> 05:35:10.081
So it's those sorts of ways from the board's perspective this first few years and then ongoing

05:35:10.701 --> 05:35:16.866
And I think there was a clarification needed from even some of the earlier discussion.

05:35:16.906 --> 05:35:19.908
It doesn't necessarily mean things will change every year.

05:35:20.428 --> 05:35:22.429
That would not be productive for anyone.

05:35:22.770 --> 05:35:31.616
But the capacity, particularly initially and as we're learning, to try to really map that out in a more deliberate way and that we will have much more data.

05:35:31.656 --> 05:35:32.456
So I hope that.

05:35:34.038 --> 05:35:34.218
Yes.

05:35:37.972 --> 05:35:46.335
And as far as the cut scores for Smarter Balanced, the review of those, the level scores, because that's part of a consortium, really.

05:35:46.375 --> 05:35:46.815
Go ahead.

05:35:46.975 --> 05:35:47.175
Right.

05:35:47.476 --> 05:36:04.422
So in a year, university systems like CSU will have the first comprehensive set of data regarding the relationship between students' performance in high school and their performance in the first year in college.

05:36:05.602 --> 05:36:28.295
That's going to be critical data that we'll use to evaluate the degree to which the achievement levels that educators set going from grade three up set a consistent and monotonic relationship towards college and career readiness, that they're valid, that they meet the objectives of predicting who is ready.

05:36:29.095 --> 05:36:30.576
Thank you, Member Rucker.

05:36:32.059 --> 05:36:34.626
That they do represent what we believe they represent.

05:36:34.847 --> 05:36:39.459
That students are ready or on track to be ready for college and career readiness.

05:36:43.162 --> 05:37:04.053
So, the consortium will be releasing an RFP for a contractor to help us develop criteria for that decision-making, identify the data elements that would go into that, and then the consortium, the group of states together, will make the decision about to what extent do we want to revisit any of the achievement levels.

05:37:04.754 --> 05:37:10.277
And then members individually have the choice of what to do with the consortium's recommended cut scores.

05:37:11.358 --> 05:37:23.628
So the state board in many states have the responsibility for adopting cut scores within each state.

05:37:29.012 --> 05:37:33.476
Other issues now that people want to, did you run down your list?

05:37:36.937 --> 05:37:37.882
Do you have more on the list?

05:37:38.485 --> 05:37:39.590
I'd like them to get through there.

05:37:39.650 --> 05:37:40.475
They're done with their list?

05:37:43.524 --> 05:38:06.210
okay go ahead i'm just trying to finish off the list but as it relates to california's decision or autonomy to adjust accept or reject the consortium scores it is in our statute that we are accepting the consortium's recommendation we do not have that autonomy to make that adjustment it's in our statute when ab484

05:38:07.310 --> 05:38:19.167
was signed into law, it was made very clear in the statute California does not have the autonomy that other consortium states have to adjust or to change the recommendation from the consortium.

05:38:26.745 --> 05:38:36.871
I'll take a couple specifically related to the inclusion of grade 11 scores in the college and career indicator.

05:38:37.311 --> 05:38:45.976
While that's part of the measure for college and career readiness in the system, a reminder, those 11th grade scores are public information.

05:38:46.296 --> 05:38:51.399
Districts will be reporting those, using those to help guide what's happening in their communities.

05:38:52.259 --> 05:39:07.748
while the discussion you brought up still needs to be explored a little further, it's not as if, as a standalone measure for 11th grade progress, that that's not information that will be just missing in action, so to speak.

05:39:09.089 --> 05:39:28.689
Secondly, I wanted to help clarify I think what member Strauss was saying on the consideration for developing the initial look at the cut points for the college and career indicator, the use of the graduation cohort

05:39:29.990 --> 05:39:49.611
as the measure for looking at the 13-14 year CST and EAP scores that are included in the packet both at the July meeting and here as to how to think about the career and college readiness indicator.

05:39:50.212 --> 05:39:50.392
The

05:39:52.153 --> 05:40:10.020
point of looking at the test scores a little bit differently and discussing this with the department staff is to come back in November with the smarter to kind of decouple this notion that it only can be cohort graduation

05:40:12.998 --> 05:40:16.042
element to determine the CCI.

05:40:16.403 --> 05:40:27.238
While that has been the pattern in the past, the hope would be that moving forward there could be some exploration of the data around smarter balance scores

05:40:28.579 --> 05:40:42.049
run for grade 11 and take a look at what happens with students in the picture of whether they're college and career ready across the dimensions that we've included.

05:40:42.129 --> 05:40:52.357
So we've had several discussions with Carrick's team to think about that a little bit differently in preparation for looking at the data a little bit differently.

05:40:52.737 --> 05:41:04.067
because graduation rate is already a single indicator and the need to look a little differently at grade 11 in the context of CCI would be helpful moving forward.

05:41:06.069 --> 05:41:08.511
I wanted to talk a little bit about the technical assistance.

05:41:15.100 --> 05:41:18.144
Just a real quick question on the 11th grade score.

05:41:18.164 --> 05:41:21.588
So it could be that it's in the second page.

05:41:21.628 --> 05:41:30.319
So in the web version of it, if you clicked on College Career Indicator, it would also give you what the 11th grade scores would and all that, right?

05:41:30.359 --> 05:41:33.864
So it's easily, quickly accessible from that page, okay.

05:41:35.692 --> 05:41:55.180
The technical assistance, I know we've had several conversations with CSESA, some of the county teams that were even here earlier, and I think the reminder about this being a local, state, and federal system, as again, board members in the local context,

05:41:55.940 --> 05:42:12.319
Looking at a large number of red indicators in the context of our local communities, that part of the requirement is to share this information in community forums and to incorporate into the annual updates at the local level.

05:42:13.279 --> 05:42:16.040
counties also in their support to districts.

05:42:16.500 --> 05:42:40.525
While we have a chance this year to really work and learn from the data analysis, the degree to which there are still going to be some very hard questions that are going to need to be asked at the local level, along with counties who this provides them then with another context to be saying, well, gee, we see these are your actions and services in the context of your LCAP.

05:42:41.025 --> 05:42:46.307
You have five red indicators here, and we're wondering how that's going to impact your revisions.

05:42:46.708 --> 05:42:48.368
How is this data being shared?

05:42:48.708 --> 05:42:58.793
I mean, even in this first year, however people are looking at this initial phase, the data is there, the information is there.

05:42:59.233 --> 05:43:07.857
The importance of really taking a look at what that data is telling everyone, the counties are already gearing up for how they're thinking about that.

05:43:09.017 --> 05:43:21.082
The California Collaborative as well, remember, is tasked also with providing the professional development and learning opportunities for using the rubrics.

05:43:21.522 --> 05:43:24.943
Those are scheduled for early November across the state.

05:43:24.963 --> 05:43:29.345
There are seven dates that will be notified for people.

05:43:29.405 --> 05:43:35.647
So this also is an opportunity to help both understand how the rubrics work,

05:43:36.027 --> 05:43:43.010
but their role really in communicating with your public and in trying to fold that information then into the annual update.

05:43:43.070 --> 05:43:55.597
So I think we have a lot of opportunities this year, particularly for areas where there's large areas that indicate students are not reaching the level of success that they need to.

05:43:56.437 --> 05:43:57.898
So did you want to take on a couple more?

05:43:57.918 --> 05:44:00.600
Just a last comment on the growth models.

05:44:01.160 --> 05:44:10.786
As I mentioned, we'll be bringing back to you something for your consideration as far as what you want to do, the reason for it, what we want out of those growth models.

05:44:11.327 --> 05:44:21.093
We'll continue to communicate with our Smarter Balanced states in the consortium, as many of them who have an 11th grade assessment.

05:44:22.754 --> 05:44:29.318
They will also be looking at this idea of comparing 8th grade to 11th grade and what kind of results that will give us.

05:44:29.338 --> 05:44:47.330
Of course, we're two years away from that, but we'll be continuing to communicate with them on that, as well as we'll want to take these things to our technical design group and our practitioner's advisory group before coming to you with this idea of what we want out of a growth model.

05:44:49.051 --> 05:44:56.295
I think the comment from Member Rucker and Member Williams about the disaggregation of data is a good reminder.

05:44:56.695 --> 05:45:07.159
I think as a board, we have to feel comfortable about what level of that disaggregation is our responsibility, because I can tell you it goes way beyond just race.

05:45:07.219 --> 05:45:09.580
It goes beyond language.

05:45:10.441 --> 05:45:16.043
You know, when I was a school principal, I bused kids from three different communities and then had a group of kids that walked to school.

05:45:16.163 --> 05:45:17.644
So I disaggregated the data.

05:45:18.044 --> 05:45:25.129
by each of the communities, just to find out if there was something there that would make a difference in how we address students' needs.

05:45:25.429 --> 05:45:33.115
So we just have to find our comfort level as to what is our responsibility versus what is a local responsibility for disaggregating that data.

05:45:33.555 --> 05:45:42.301
And then I think, lastly, to circle back to the Williams discussion with charter schools, I think David Sapp has a comment.

05:45:47.071 --> 05:45:48.512
So David Sapp, State Board staff.

05:45:48.552 --> 05:45:49.772
I'm going to stand up if that's okay.

05:45:50.392 --> 05:45:53.853
Just two quick legal clarifications on the student groups.

05:45:53.893 --> 05:45:56.574
Those are also defined in statute that the board is implementing.

05:45:56.634 --> 05:46:04.517
So Education Code 52052 defines the student groups that have to be addressed through the LCAP and also then reflected in the rubric.

05:46:04.557 --> 05:46:08.938
So that's the sort of legislative framework the board's operating in on this question.

05:46:09.678 --> 05:46:14.160
Specifically to Board Member Rucker's question about the Williams Settlement and Priority One,

05:46:15.281 --> 05:46:17.503
This, again, is something that is spelled out in statute.

05:46:17.563 --> 05:46:30.156
The actual priority area itself that the legislature adopted in 2013 defines the elements of that priority by cross-reference to the underlying Ed Code that implemented the Williams Settlement.

05:46:30.957 --> 05:46:37.664
Those sections apply only to school districts, so charters are exempt from the operation of those statutes.

05:46:38.164 --> 05:46:48.376
And that's been reflected in the LCAP instructions, so the actual wording of the proposed standard that's in the item for this meeting reflects the wording in the current LCAP instructions.

05:46:48.396 --> 05:46:51.780
It's actually the reason why that wording was used here, to try to track.

05:46:52.120 --> 05:46:58.528
But as I said earlier in responding to Board Member Williams' question, this is something I think in terms of the clarification around

05:46:58.968 --> 05:47:10.154
how the level of detail in the LCAP instructions and in the rubrics, that's something that we want to take a closer look at and come back to the board in November with an update and any recommended additional action as appropriate.

05:47:16.818 --> 05:47:20.920
So I'm not sure we answered all the questions, but, oh, did you have a further question?

05:47:22.441 --> 05:47:27.863
All right, but we've taken notes and that was what I was hoping to say.

05:47:27.983 --> 05:47:29.303
So I do have it on the screen.

05:47:29.343 --> 05:47:33.905
You have it on the first page of your item as well.

05:47:33.925 --> 05:47:37.466
I'm ready.

05:47:38.226 --> 05:47:45.228
Before I make the motion, I neglected to acknowledge all of the hard work that WestEd has contributed to this effort.

05:47:45.248 --> 05:47:47.309
So I didn't want to let that go by.

05:47:48.069 --> 05:47:50.590
But with that, I would move the staff recommendation.

05:47:53.271 --> 05:47:56.214
Okay, any further board discussion on the motion?

05:47:58.876 --> 05:47:59.116
None.

05:47:59.357 --> 05:48:00.778
All those in favor, raise your hands.

05:48:02.940 --> 05:48:04.762
Okay, it is unanimous.

05:48:10.026 --> 05:48:12.529
Yeah.

05:48:13.490 --> 05:48:15.391
Ten large hands, one small.

05:48:19.059 --> 05:48:25.948
Okay, before we take a break, the good news is we passed something that took three years to do.

05:48:34.156 --> 05:48:35.737
And now we're through with item one.

05:48:37.558 --> 05:48:38.619
But here's the bad news.

05:48:39.199 --> 05:48:45.743
It is with great regret that I announce that Nancy Brownell will be leaving the State Board of Education office.

05:48:46.984 --> 05:48:48.645
She'll leave in the end of September.

05:48:50.106 --> 05:48:53.528
She has been a key staff working as a senior fellow since 2012.

05:48:54.789 --> 05:49:00.293
She worked with CDE and SBE jointly on the Common Core implementation.

05:49:01.033 --> 05:49:04.716
Whatever success we've had with that, she's been a significant factor in.

05:49:06.017 --> 05:49:12.922
And as you know, she was transferred over to accountability by the executive director.

05:49:12.942 --> 05:49:14.343
I wouldn't wish that on anybody.

05:49:15.484 --> 05:49:19.087
So she went there, and we've seen the result of that today.

05:49:20.328 --> 05:49:34.662
Nancy has accepted a new position as the Director for the Accrediting Commission for Schools, Western Association of Schools and Colleges, known as WASC, which accredits secondary schools and some elementary.

05:49:35.062 --> 05:49:36.604
She worked there at WASC in 1994.

05:49:38.806 --> 05:49:52.313
And one thing we hope and she will aspire to accomplish is integrating our accountability and LCAP systems with accreditation.

05:49:52.454 --> 05:49:56.696
This has been a goal for a long time.

05:49:56.736 --> 05:49:58.577
We're really picking up momentum.

05:50:00.018 --> 05:50:08.866
This was one of the things in the governor's list in 2010, as he underwent accreditation, could we somehow consolidate this?

05:50:10.067 --> 05:50:12.369
And so I think she'll bring that off.

05:50:12.429 --> 05:50:15.352
So her last day will be September 30th.

05:50:15.392 --> 05:50:16.413
Let's give Nancy a hand.

05:50:31.498 --> 05:50:31.838
Thank you.

05:50:31.898 --> 05:50:39.521
It's been an honor and a pleasure to work for you and our colleagues at WestEd, at the counties, at the department.

05:50:40.261 --> 05:50:45.423
It's been a really interesting sort of end of my career almost.

05:50:46.864 --> 05:51:00.730
And as I mentioned to my family and colleagues, as Frodo said to Samwise Gamgee's, I might have room for a little bit more before my professional journey.

05:51:00.810 --> 05:51:07.033
And so my commendations to the board for the excellent work and the department in West Staten counties.

05:51:07.113 --> 05:51:09.034
And it's been a terrific opportunity.

05:51:09.394 --> 05:51:11.015
I know you'll carry on in great ways.

05:51:11.675 --> 05:51:17.300
Nancy, what I love is that you're leaving to get away from this and Mike gives you an assignment to do when you're gone.

05:51:18.121 --> 05:51:19.862
I also have a certificate for you.

05:51:23.125 --> 05:51:24.986
The board will recess till 20 of 3.

05:51:54.130 --> 05:51:58.152
which is the state ESSA plan.

05:51:59.413 --> 05:52:08.337
This is the beginning, formal beginning of another long journey for the board on a major and complex and multifaceted issue.

05:52:08.997 --> 05:52:15.901
So Chief Deputy Glenn Price will open up and give us some initial comments

05:52:17.021 --> 05:52:20.104
to orient you on what we'll be hearing.

05:52:21.105 --> 05:52:24.888
And I see this as an initial conversation by the board members.

05:52:24.948 --> 05:52:27.310
We haven't really focused on this.

05:52:27.570 --> 05:52:33.775
And so I think everything's on the table in terms of what you're interested in.

05:52:34.336 --> 05:52:35.857
So Glenn, why don't you open up?

05:52:36.077 --> 05:52:44.044
And then Barbara Murchison, who is leading the department's effort on putting the plan together, will also speak.

05:52:45.512 --> 05:52:46.833
Well, thank you, President Kirsten.

05:52:46.973 --> 05:52:54.055
And let me just first offer my congratulations as the first one back up here at the podium on the momentous decision that you just took.

05:52:54.115 --> 05:52:57.556
It's really exciting for all of us and for the state of California.

05:52:57.576 --> 05:52:59.117
We thank you so much.

05:52:59.197 --> 05:53:04.339
And it feels like we're just going back to back with exciting items as we think about

05:53:04.919 --> 05:53:10.201
this opportunity now to engage and think about our new ESSA state plan.

05:53:10.241 --> 05:53:27.166
And as we're kind of reflecting on this a little bit, I wanted to just refresh our memories that actually it's been about 14 years since the Board of Education of the State of California, 2002, did a complete new state plan.

05:53:27.526 --> 05:53:31.947
And when you think about that, and one of the reasons that I wanted to point it out is that

05:53:32.587 --> 05:53:40.555
The ramifications of that plan adopted by that board in 2002 is going to play out over a period of 14 years.

05:53:40.615 --> 05:53:47.121
So it's just to say that it's something that I think that we really want to be deliberate about.

05:53:47.981 --> 05:54:04.394
reflective about, and just as you were very careful with the development and eventually the adoption of the first phase of the LCFF evaluation rubrics, that we take the same kind of deep approach with the ESSA state plan.

05:54:05.274 --> 05:54:14.699
I want to really thank Barbara Murchison and her team for the amazing stakeholder engagement work that's gone on so far, and that work will continue.

05:54:15.300 --> 05:54:25.145
And as we move forward, speaking of really wanting to be deliberate, getting out and continuing that kind of authentic stakeholder engagement work will be really important.

05:54:27.826 --> 05:54:45.554
One of the things that I wanted to highlight, and I touched on it a little bit in my comments around the LCFF evaluation rubrics item that we just went through, it's just again to remind us and really to remind those people who are in LEAs and school districts around our state,

05:54:46.415 --> 05:55:04.590
that with the adoption of the ESSA transition plan that this board did is that you basically said to districts that their LCAP plus their consolidated application really is meeting the requirements now of their LEA plan.

05:55:04.610 --> 05:55:09.534
So the plan that they need to be doing in relationship to their ESSA requirements and

05:55:10.154 --> 05:55:24.148
and funding is covered by those two elements and I would ask you to maybe as you're thinking about the future to be continuing to think about how we would be continuing to consolidate and integrate those two plans.

05:55:24.528 --> 05:55:30.514
In addition to the possibility of looking at the single plan for student achievement and how that could possibly be rolled together again as part of a

05:55:30.934 --> 05:55:44.005
consolidated integrated plan so we don't and aren't asking our our LEAs around the state to be working on a bunch of different plans with the same people covering some of the same topics but in in different formats.

05:55:44.706 --> 05:55:55.335
The other this quick technical item that I wanted to point out for the board before I pose a couple of focus questions to you and and bring up Barbara is really going to present the majority of the material here is that

05:55:55.715 --> 05:56:07.944
the board will have a critical decision coming up around when to submit the the ESSA state plan and just to highlight that the United States Department of Education has provided two dates that that could happen by.

05:56:08.284 --> 05:56:16.910
The first would be in March and the second would be in July of 2017 so just for you to keep that in mind as you as you move forward here.

05:56:17.670 --> 05:56:18.831
So let me just

05:56:22.302 --> 05:56:42.678
As you think about and listen to Barbara, and she's got a great amount of information to present, building on a huge amount of work that's been done to date, I would like to ask you, I know it'll be a temptation to really get down into some kind of weedy technical questions, and we definitely at some point want to get into those.

05:56:43.178 --> 05:56:58.286
But as President Kirst indicated, we're at a point right now where we really need some pretty deep thinking from the board around the ESSA State Plan, and we'd like you to keep these three focus questions in mind as you're listening to the information today.

05:56:58.866 --> 05:57:05.011
First of all, what overall policy directions do you feel should drive ESSA planning?

05:57:05.091 --> 05:57:10.956
What are the policies that you'd like to see really furthered by ESSA?

05:57:11.116 --> 05:57:17.260
Are we moving with this in terms of the policy objectives that we'd like to achieve as the state of California?

05:57:17.821 --> 05:57:20.043
So thinking about those policy objectives.

05:57:20.803 --> 05:57:32.535
And then some deep thinking if possible around what are some of the significant statewide programmatic opportunities and priorities that should drive the ESSA plan.

05:57:32.555 --> 05:57:41.023
And some of those I think were emerged from our previous discussion around the kinds of capacity building that we need in the state of California.

05:57:41.643 --> 05:57:52.357
And then, as we think about the policy and then the programs that will help to drive that policy and realize those policy objectives, how should we be proceeding with the planning and approval process?

05:57:52.377 --> 05:57:57.724
And we obviously talked about that a little bit in terms of aligning our LEA planning and LCAP work.

05:57:58.164 --> 05:58:04.986
But what are the kinds of planning and approval processes that you'd like to see that would really help to defer to those priorities?

05:58:05.066 --> 05:58:13.689
So policy directions, if you could keep that in mind, key programmatic opportunities, and mechanically, how is this going to work going forward?

05:58:14.210 --> 05:58:18.431
So with that in mind, I'd like to turn the mic over to Barbara Murchison.

05:58:18.671 --> 05:58:26.434
And as she's coming up, just really on behalf of all of us, just thank her and Joy and her team for all the tremendous work that's gone on so far.

05:58:27.475 --> 05:58:35.368
You've seen it in the item that's before you, but as deep as that is, that's just the tip of the iceberg on the great work that's been accomplished to date.

05:58:35.428 --> 05:58:36.430
So, Barbara?

05:58:38.905 --> 05:58:40.366
Thank you, Chief Deputy Price.

05:58:40.726 --> 05:58:43.948
Good afternoon, President Kerr, Superintendent Torlakson, board members.

05:58:44.608 --> 05:58:46.089
I am Barbara Murchison, S.S.

05:58:46.129 --> 05:58:49.210
State lead here at the department.

05:58:49.270 --> 05:58:56.334
The purpose of this item is to provide you and the public with an update regarding the progress and the development of the Every Student Succeeds Act, or S.S.

05:58:56.414 --> 05:58:57.195
State Plan.

05:58:57.735 --> 05:59:03.278
This is an information item, and the CDE recommends that the board take action as necessary and appropriate.

05:59:04.676 --> 05:59:12.756
Before we talk about the plan, I want to spend a few minutes providing you with a brief update around the status of the ESSA proposed regulations.

05:59:13.789 --> 05:59:23.331
The proposed regulations for accountability, data reporting, and state plans were published in the Federal Register back May 31st, and the public had until August 1st to comment on those.

05:59:23.871 --> 05:59:28.332
President Kirsten, Superintendent Torlakson submitted a joint letter in response to those regs.

05:59:29.112 --> 05:59:32.052
The letter has been made available as an August memorandum.

05:59:32.452 --> 05:59:34.933
So that is available to both you and the public.

05:59:36.233 --> 05:59:42.274
EDU has received more than 21,000 comments in response to those proposed regulations.

05:59:43.888 --> 05:59:54.097
The proposed regulations for assessment and innovative assessment pilots were published in the Federal Register on July 11th, and the 60-day public comment period closes tomorrow, September 9th.

05:59:54.798 --> 06:00:05.788
We anticipate that a joint response regarding the assessment regulations will be submitted tomorrow, and Director Senter will be able to provide information regarding the letter during her presentation tomorrow morning.

06:00:07.529 --> 06:00:12.933
Earlier this week, I think they're timing the release of these proposed regulations with your board meetings.

06:00:14.875 --> 06:00:20.880
Earlier this week, the proposed regulations for supplement not supplant were published in the Federal Register.

06:00:21.420 --> 06:00:31.688
Recall that the negotiated rulemaking process for these regs was not successful, so there may be quite a few comments in response to those as well.

06:00:32.629 --> 06:00:38.470
The public comment period for the supplement not-to-plant proposed regulations closes on November 7th.

06:00:38.990 --> 06:00:51.533
So CDE staff is in the early stages of analyzing this new set of regulations to understand the potential impacts to California, and we expect to bring more information to you at the November meeting.

06:00:52.713 --> 06:01:00.235
Anyone who's interested in all of those sets of regs, we have information and links available on our CDE SO webpage.

06:01:01.917 --> 06:01:08.542
So we're not going to be able to finalize our ESSA state plan unless we have final regulations.

06:01:09.463 --> 06:01:11.625
Given that our colleagues in Washington, D.C.

06:01:11.685 --> 06:01:26.336
are going to need to address those 21,000 comments on the first set, and given that the public comment period for supplement not supplant doesn't even close until November 7th, we've updated our draft plan development timeline.

06:01:28.132 --> 06:01:29.754
And here we have it before you.

06:01:29.854 --> 06:01:34.459
Recall, every time I show this timeline, I usually put a draft in the front and an asterisk in the back.

06:01:35.000 --> 06:01:47.313
I've removed the draft in the front just to feel a little more like we're getting to where we might be, but there's still an asterisk that says that this timeline is subject to change pending board feedback and regulations from ED.

06:01:48.991 --> 06:01:54.072
We think this new timeline will provide more time for our friends back in Washington, D.C.

06:01:54.112 --> 06:02:07.195
to finish the work of preparing final regulations, and also will provide us with some good time to engage stakeholders, including the Practitioners Advisory Group, in our plan development process.

06:02:07.935 --> 06:02:10.256
So you can see we actually have

06:02:11.036 --> 06:02:20.078
It mapped out so that we can systematically go to the CPAG, bring them information to provide feedback back to you.

06:02:20.138 --> 06:02:21.518
It works out pretty nicely.

06:02:22.479 --> 06:02:31.421
You can see on March 6th, Chief Deputy Price mentioned there were two days for submission of state plans in the proposed regulations.

06:02:31.881 --> 06:02:33.001
That also could change.

06:02:33.661 --> 06:02:36.084
The first opportunity to submit plans to the U.S.

06:02:36.104 --> 06:02:42.010
Department of Education is March 6th, and then there's another opportunity on March 9th.

06:02:42.390 --> 06:02:43.852
I mean, sorry, July 3rd.

06:02:44.232 --> 06:02:45.653
March 9th, what's happening then?

06:02:46.314 --> 06:02:47.575
Must be a special day somewhere.

06:02:49.137 --> 06:02:56.344
So, as I said, the submission of state plan deadlines are in the proposed recs.

06:02:57.333 --> 06:03:00.734
We have quarterly calls with our colleagues back at the Department of Education.

06:03:00.774 --> 06:03:01.794
We had one last week.

06:03:02.534 --> 06:03:19.818
And we said, hey, given that we don't even have final regs and are not likely to have them for a while, and given that we really want to have some authentic stakeholder engagement with our final plan, which has to be at least 30 days, how are you thinking that states are going to submit things in March 6?

06:03:20.958 --> 06:03:23.899
NED, whenever we talk to them, they're very careful about not

06:03:24.634 --> 06:03:26.715
really definitively answering anything.

06:03:28.656 --> 06:03:42.782
But they did say, they acknowledged that they'd received many, many comments on the timelines associated with their proposed regs, and they know that states are grappling with this question about how are we going to submit a plan based on final regs if we don't have final regs.

06:03:43.102 --> 06:03:44.523
They're also going to build out a template

06:03:45.003 --> 06:03:46.825
based on final regs that we'll need to.

06:03:47.105 --> 06:03:48.986
So there are a lot of pieces still in the air.

06:03:49.527 --> 06:04:02.178
And they acknowledged that one of the things that they are looking at very closely as they review the comments and think about what changes to make in the final regulations is the timeline for submission of state plans.

06:04:02.678 --> 06:04:06.141
So again, as I've been saying every time I've been up here in the last few months,

06:04:07.302 --> 06:04:12.187
We're just going to move forward doing the best we can with the information that we have.

06:04:12.627 --> 06:04:18.653
But here's our new timeline that's looking at a March provisional approval.

06:04:23.157 --> 06:04:27.381
Do you know of any other states that are going to go in March?

06:04:27.401 --> 06:04:33.126
Did the call reveal what states are feeling ready and having enough time and what states aren't?

06:04:33.502 --> 06:04:36.503
So yeah, ED didn't talk to us about other states.

06:04:37.543 --> 06:04:43.545
We are going to a big ESSA planning meeting that's being facilitated by CCSSO next week.

06:04:43.565 --> 06:04:46.206
So we'll learn more just this morning on Twitter.

06:04:46.286 --> 06:04:55.309
I noticed that Arizona on Twitter, I noticed that Arizona had made its draft plan available for its public review just yesterday.

06:04:55.849 --> 06:04:58.330
So I think every state is trying to figure out, I think,

06:05:00.546 --> 06:05:03.808
I don't know—you know, California is in a very different place than a lot of other states.

06:05:05.790 --> 06:05:12.895
A lot of states are just now trying to figure out a new accountability system that they're going to have to do on—based on proposed regs.

06:05:13.335 --> 06:05:28.786
We've been working on our accountability system for years, so we're—but I think part of the California way is taking the time to engage stakeholders and move forward thoughtfully and carefully, so other states may be doing what's right for them, but I think we'll just need to do what's right for us.

06:05:29.710 --> 06:05:35.414
We'll know more next week about what all the other states are doing.

06:05:37.276 --> 06:05:43.741
Let's shift from the regulations and the timelines and move on to ESSA and the Consolidated State Plan.

06:05:44.966 --> 06:05:52.411
First of all, I want you to be assured that it is not my intention to cover every detail included in that 91-page item.

06:05:57.415 --> 06:05:57.755
Okay.

06:05:57.915 --> 06:05:58.656
Just so you know.

06:05:59.476 --> 06:06:10.765
Our goal in constructing the item was to respond to the board's request for more detailed information regarding ESSA consolidated plan requirements and where the state stands relative to those requirements.

06:06:11.565 --> 06:06:21.134
We also really wanted to provide you with some starting points for a conversation around the use of funds and how ESSA can supplement the work that's already underway in California.

06:06:21.894 --> 06:06:37.428
But most importantly, we really want to hear from you your thoughts about overall policy directions that will guide our next steps and make sure that our plan development work is consistent with your collective vision for how the federal pieces work with the state pieces.

06:06:40.638 --> 06:06:45.204
So I'm going to go way back because we found this picture and we really like this picture.

06:06:45.905 --> 06:06:54.536
That is a picture of Lyndon B. Johnson signing the original Elementary and Secondary Education Act back in April of 1965.

06:06:56.559 --> 06:07:01.222
He is sitting in front of his very first school with his very first teacher.

06:07:01.682 --> 06:07:02.742
Come on, how do you?

06:07:05.204 --> 06:07:12.348
And, you know, there's a quote from President Johnson there, no measure I have signed or will ever sign means more to the future of America.

06:07:14.932 --> 06:07:18.074
So the ESEA has always been focused on equity.

06:07:18.674 --> 06:07:31.862
Among other things, the original ESEA provided funds to districts serving low-income students, funds for students with disabilities, funds for bilingual education, and funds to provide technical assistance to rural schools.

06:07:34.281 --> 06:07:42.166
The ESEA has been reauthorized a number of times since 1965 with new requirements and programs being added as the law has evolved.

06:07:42.946 --> 06:07:48.670
As you can see from the slide, the last reauthorization was No Child Left Behind in 2001.

06:07:49.510 --> 06:07:55.294
Many in the education community were starting to wonder if the law would ever be reauthorized and then

06:07:57.489 --> 06:08:02.253
President Obama signed the ESSA on December 10, 2015.

06:08:04.314 --> 06:08:10.820
As you can see by his quote, ESSA remains, first and foremost, a law designed to promote equity.

06:08:11.400 --> 06:08:23.850
And President Obama said, with this bill, we reaffirm that fundamentally, American ideal, that every child, regardless of race, income, background, zip code where they live, deserves the chance to make of their lives what they will.

06:08:27.358 --> 06:08:36.223
So I won't go into much detail about what is new in ESSA because we've talked about this, but the new reauthorization provides much more authority and responsibility to states.

06:08:36.964 --> 06:08:43.167
We have the opportunity to create that integrated local, state, and federal accountability and continuous improvement system.

06:08:44.748 --> 06:08:54.794
And we also have the opportunity, after 14 years of No Child Left Behind, to examine our current practice and leverage the law to support current state priorities.

06:08:58.553 --> 06:09:00.875
So there are many programs within the ESSA.

06:09:01.115 --> 06:09:04.238
All of them are provided in attachment one of the item.

06:09:05.739 --> 06:09:10.403
A subset of the ESSA programs may be included in the consolidated state plan.

06:09:11.044 --> 06:09:16.549
These programs are indicated with an asterisk in the document and are listed on this slide.

06:09:18.311 --> 06:09:34.937
Many of the programs not included in the Consolidated State Plan are competitive grant programs, like Title II, Part B, and Title IV, Part C. Others, like several Title IV programs and the Title VI, are programs for which the state educational agency is not eligible.

06:09:35.993 --> 06:09:51.244
Although we could choose to develop separate plans for each of the ESSA programs, given the state's work to build a single coherent system that serves all students, it makes sense for California to develop and submit a consolidated state plan that describes our intentions across programs.

06:09:52.285 --> 06:10:00.091
Unless the board would prefer to take a different direction, all future references to the ESSA state plan really refer to the consolidated state plan.

06:10:00.311 --> 06:10:04.394
So when we talk about the ESSA state plan, we're talking about all of these programs.

06:10:05.976 --> 06:10:15.081
So since the item posted last week, we received some feedback that many of the programs included in the consolidated state plan may not have been previously brought to the board for approval.

06:10:15.321 --> 06:10:19.904
So we went on a little bit of a detective investigation hunt.

06:10:20.184 --> 06:10:26.487
Some of you may remember, you may even have the consolidated application from 2002.

06:10:29.515 --> 06:10:30.695
So we went and found this.

06:10:30.715 --> 06:10:35.196
You can find it in the internet archives, the CDE webpage archives.

06:10:35.276 --> 06:10:41.398
It's not really posted anymore, but if you have friends in the technology services division, they will make it available to you.

06:10:44.158 --> 06:10:56.261
And on page five of this document, which we cross-checked just last week to make sure, you can see that the board-approved consolidated application contains

06:10:57.990 --> 06:11:24.438
Information regarding all the programs listed on this slide, with just a couple of exceptions, the Education for Homeless Children and Youth Program Plan was approved as a standalone NCLB plan, also in 2002, and then Title IV, Part A, used to focus on safe and drug-free schools and communities, and many of these elements have been folded into the new Title IV Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants.

06:11:24.958 --> 06:11:32.744
So, even though you may not have seen them, predecessors 14 years ago did see plans for each of these programs.

06:11:34.923 --> 06:11:44.210
For the most part, many of the programs listed on this slide have been administered successfully by the department in accordance with federal expectations, so they haven't really needed to come to the state board.

06:11:44.250 --> 06:11:47.152
They haven't had problems that caused them to come here.

06:11:47.633 --> 06:11:56.779
The development of the ESSA state plan provides us with an opportunity to take a look at how those programs are being administered and make any adjustments as appropriate.

06:11:59.821 --> 06:12:07.203
So, part 299 subpart G of the proposed regulations outlines state plan requirements.

06:12:08.104 --> 06:12:13.586
Attachment 2 of the item goes into quite a bit of detail regarding these requirements.

06:12:14.366 --> 06:12:23.152
Now, the requirements that are in Attachment 2 are the ones that are available to us as part of the proposed regulations.

06:12:23.172 --> 06:12:26.995
So everything in Attachment 2 is not a final requirement.

06:12:27.555 --> 06:12:34.780
It is just the best we know at this time around what the expectations are for the plan.

06:12:36.294 --> 06:12:48.083
The document was informed by a large number of staff working in program offices all across the department and reflects our current understanding of where the state stands in relation to these various proposed requirements.

06:12:49.344 --> 06:12:53.347
I want to be very, very clear about the color coding and our intentions.

06:12:54.348 --> 06:12:57.551
None of the contents, green, yellow,

06:12:58.496 --> 06:13:01.759
any color, have been definitively decided.

06:13:02.079 --> 06:13:04.201
Nothing's definitively decided.

06:13:04.281 --> 06:13:19.553
We won't have a final plan until March, and we anticipate that that plan will be informed by your feedback today and at future board meetings, will be informed by a variety of stakeholder input, and will be informed by additional information from ED.

06:13:20.854 --> 06:13:24.157
But some of the elements are more clearly ready

06:13:24.961 --> 06:13:28.263
for inclusion in the draft plan than others.

06:13:29.543 --> 06:13:34.606
Many of the elements shaded green and Mark decided were approved well before ESSA was signed.

06:13:34.686 --> 06:13:41.229
For example, over the years, many decisions have been made around California's new system of standards and assessments.

06:13:41.789 --> 06:13:42.950
So those are marked green.

06:13:43.370 --> 06:13:44.631
We've had a lot of conversations.

06:13:45.091 --> 06:13:56.080
If we want to open that up again and talk more about standards and assessments, we can, but the green just gives us a sense that we've spent a lot of time on that and feel pretty solid on California's direction with that.

06:13:58.078 --> 06:14:03.964
Others were made in the context of California's Educator Equity Plan, which was approved by the board last July.

06:14:04.604 --> 06:14:10.410
So the document is color-coded to provide a general sense of where we are relative to the requirements.

06:14:10.951 --> 06:14:16.977
It is not comprehensive and does not provide precise information regarding the status of each requirement.

06:14:16.997 --> 06:14:22.282
And as you can imagine, in process means a lot of different things to different people.

06:14:23.282 --> 06:14:27.424
There can be a very fine line between in process and not yet decided.

06:14:27.884 --> 06:14:38.288
So really it was just color coded to provide the board and the general public a sense of where we think we stand in relation to those proposed requirements.

06:14:39.049 --> 06:14:44.271
Many of the elements shaded yellow are evolving through the development of the LCFF evaluation rubrics.

06:14:45.768 --> 06:14:53.293
And in general, for elements shaded green or yellow, what will be included in the plan that we are bringing to you in November is relatively clear.

06:14:54.533 --> 06:15:02.719
Elements shaded orange are underway, which means some deliberation has occurred, but these will really require additional discussion and direction.

06:15:03.739 --> 06:15:06.121
And then there are a few elements that are shaded red.

06:15:07.034 --> 06:15:11.435
And those will really require final regulations before being decided.

06:15:11.736 --> 06:15:26.420
So for most of those, like the summative rating, the weighting of indicators, the reporting of per-pupil expenditures, the state knows how it would prefer to proceed, but our preference is not necessarily consistent with the proposed regulations.

06:15:28.341 --> 06:15:34.823
Since the item posted, we did receive some feedback that it is missing a certain grain size or level of detail.

06:15:35.831 --> 06:15:38.672
or that something that is green should really be yellow.

06:15:39.332 --> 06:15:45.134
And again, this is a document that's intended to provide a general overview of plan requirements.

06:15:45.755 --> 06:15:49.776
The draft plan that is coming to you in November will include much more detail.

06:15:50.716 --> 06:15:52.057
It will not be color coded.

06:15:53.457 --> 06:15:54.698
Don't get attached to the colors.

06:15:55.942 --> 06:16:03.350
And I don't really recommend that board members spend a lot of time discussing the specific elements in this 30-page chart.

06:16:04.030 --> 06:16:14.381
However, if there are elements that are inconsistent with your understanding, or you would really like to be provided more information regarding a specific requirement or program,

06:16:14.946 --> 06:16:17.329
We would really appreciate that feedback today.

06:16:18.571 --> 06:16:24.239
Again, we'll be bringing you successive iterations of the plan in November, January, and March.

06:16:25.120 --> 06:16:30.007
All plan content are subject to change at your discretion at any time.

06:16:31.088 --> 06:16:41.371
So, attachment three provides some starting points for board discussion regarding opportunities in the ESSA to supplement work already underway in California.

06:16:42.231 --> 06:16:48.693
Before we look more specifically at these opportunities, there are a couple of fundamentals that we want to consider.

06:16:51.175 --> 06:16:53.398
First of all, federal funds are supplemental.

06:16:53.418 --> 06:17:11.158
I think it's really important if the state is already funding something with state funds or local funds, it's not appropriate use of federal funds to spend the money in the same way, as the funds are intended to improve outcomes for disadvantaged students in addition to not in place of state investments.

06:17:12.267 --> 06:17:17.069
Per board member request, we have provided a great deal of fiscal information in this item.

06:17:17.809 --> 06:17:21.250
It's important to keep in mind that these are preliminary estimates.

06:17:23.111 --> 06:17:32.695
Although we don't anticipate any significant departures from these estimates, we do not yet have a federal budget, and we don't anticipate that we will have one until after the election in November.

06:17:33.476 --> 06:17:39.499
The estimates in the item and in this presentation are provided for planning purposes and are subject to change.

06:17:39.960 --> 06:17:48.865
So if you look at the graphic on this slide, you can see the vast majority of California education funding comes from state and local funds.

06:17:49.485 --> 06:18:01.652
The little green band of supplemental money up at the top represents federal funds, about $8 billion per year, of which approximately $2 billion is ESSA funding.

06:18:06.857 --> 06:18:22.583
So another really important consideration as we think about use of federal funds is that that's to provide states with the opportunity to think kind of big across programs and use resources to support the larger state vision.

06:18:23.344 --> 06:18:35.429
So with the transition to LCFF, California LEAs have been asked to identify needs, set goals in collaboration with their communities, and then allocate resources to support attainment of those goals.

06:18:36.169 --> 06:18:46.539
With ESSA, states now have kind of a similar opportunity to think about our vision and goals first and then dedicate our federal resources across programs to achieving those goals.

06:18:47.300 --> 06:18:58.210
Our first responsibility is to administer the funds to LEAs and provide the technical assistance and support as needed to ensure appropriate use, but we do have an opportunity to look beyond the silos

06:18:58.991 --> 06:19:02.752
and create a set of supplemental programs that's more holistic and coherent.

06:19:03.313 --> 06:19:07.894
As you can see from this slide, ED has been very explicit about this opportunity.

06:19:08.875 --> 06:19:22.120
The proposed regulation cite, we seek to improve teaching and learning by encouraging greater cross-program coordination, planning, and service delivery, provide greater flexibility to state and local authorities through consolidated plans and reporting,

06:19:22.640 --> 06:19:28.685
and enhance the integration of programs under the ESEA as amended by the ESSA with state and local programs.

06:19:28.725 --> 06:19:29.986
So that's kind of exciting.

06:19:30.026 --> 06:19:42.055
It gives us the opportunity to think beyond, here's what we do for Title I, here's what we do for Title II, and think about how could we creatively use all of those resources in ways to achieve our goals.

06:19:45.532 --> 06:19:52.860
So this will require states to consult with diverse stakeholders at multiple points during the design, development, and implementation of our plan.

06:19:55.424 --> 06:20:05.827
This spring, CDE staff, in partnership with our colleagues at the Comprehensive Center and five county offices of education, conducted six weeks of concerted stakeholder outreach activities.

06:20:06.527 --> 06:20:11.528
During this time, we conducted two webinars, six regional meetings, and a survey.

06:20:11.548 --> 06:20:17.650
400 people participated in the two ESSA webinars, and you can see in the little green chart

06:20:18.570 --> 06:20:32.670
who was engaged in that webinar, where they are from, who they affiliate themselves with, county offices, curriculum coordinators, district administrators, school administrators, teachers, et cetera.

06:20:35.444 --> 06:20:39.969
We hosted or co-hosted six ESSA regional stakeholder meetings.

06:20:40.749 --> 06:20:43.512
More than 300 people participated in those.

06:20:44.613 --> 06:20:49.198
And again, a cross-section of folks from across various stakeholder groups.

06:20:49.959 --> 06:20:53.202
And there's a little map that shows we've traveled the state far and wide.

06:20:55.751 --> 06:21:02.015
And then for our SS stakeholder survey, we had 276 people participate.

06:21:02.736 --> 06:21:11.121
So some of those stakeholders may have participated in a couple of different opportunities, but overall, that's nearly 1,000 points of contact with diverse stakeholders.

06:21:11.742 --> 06:21:19.047
Member Strauss joined us for the Los Angeles regional meeting and can attest to the fact that stakeholders had a lot of suggestions and requests.

06:21:20.583 --> 06:21:28.168
Our colleagues at the Comprehensive Center took on the heroic task of analyzing and organizing all of those points of feedback.

06:21:28.188 --> 06:21:31.450
For each of those people, there were multiple points of feedback.

06:21:33.731 --> 06:21:38.654
In general, we got a lot of different kinds of feedback, but the top five things we heard about

06:21:39.206 --> 06:21:47.694
which I think are interesting, we received 209 comments regarding best practices, resources, guidance, and definitions.

06:21:48.515 --> 06:21:53.259
Stakeholders really want access to vetted resources of all kinds.

06:21:53.865 --> 06:21:56.847
They want curricular resources to support instruction.

06:21:57.327 --> 06:22:02.930
They want resources such as the Standards for Model Practice, the ones that would be associated with how do we improve our schools.

06:22:03.570 --> 06:22:06.952
They want all kinds of resources, but they don't want just any resources.

06:22:06.992 --> 06:22:11.595
They want vetted resources, because I think they know they can find all kinds of resources.

06:22:11.655 --> 06:22:14.617
So that was what we heard the most about.

06:22:15.748 --> 06:22:18.791
We received 206 comments about the accountability system.

06:22:18.991 --> 06:22:20.032
There's good news there.

06:22:20.453 --> 06:22:32.304
Stakeholders were generally very supportive of this new accountability system, supportive of the multiple measures, and very supportive of the state's intention to align state and federal requirements and plans.

06:22:32.364 --> 06:22:33.465
So that's good.

06:22:34.657 --> 06:22:42.488
We received a lot of comments around professional learning and technical assistance and a lot of comments around educator excellence.

06:22:43.089 --> 06:22:48.096
Stakeholders really would like to see more state-supported professional learning opportunities.

06:22:49.801 --> 06:22:55.762
And then we received another 144 comments about the importance of a well-rounded curriculum.

06:22:56.562 --> 06:23:09.405
I think a lot of people are concerned or actually see ESSA as an opportunity to broaden the curriculum again after the unintended consequence of No Child Left Behind kind of narrowing the curriculum to people focusing on math and reading.

06:23:09.885 --> 06:23:11.805
We heard from a lot of different folks.

06:23:11.845 --> 06:23:16.246
The physical education community was out in force, school librarians,

06:23:17.006 --> 06:23:28.372
the arts community, history civics folks, after-school providers, a really nice cross-section of people who really wanted to be a part of this public process and talk about the things that were important to them.

06:23:29.092 --> 06:23:40.318
So the complete summary report, including about 75 pages of just raw data because we thought it'd be fun for folks to go find their comments, is available as an August information memorandum.

06:23:43.570 --> 06:23:52.053
If you go, if you make the time to go to a meeting and share your comments or do a survey and share, it's nice to be able to see that they're actually there.

06:23:52.073 --> 06:23:53.633
I think that's nice.

06:23:54.573 --> 06:24:00.415
All of this feedback can be helpful to the board when we're thinking about overall direction of the plan.

06:24:04.204 --> 06:24:13.206
So CDE staff has identified several opportunities within MIASA to leverage the priorities that you will establish.

06:24:15.647 --> 06:24:23.449
First of all, there's a school improvement opportunity in Title I. There's a direct student services opportunity in Title I.

06:24:25.066 --> 06:24:29.950
There's an opportunity to support principals and other school leaders in Title II.

06:24:31.010 --> 06:24:35.073
There are state-level activity funds associated with Titles II, III, and IV.

06:24:36.820 --> 06:24:41.366
We have the opportunity, everyone will need to submit a new LEA plan.

06:24:41.686 --> 06:24:46.211
That's an opportunity for the state to reinforce state priorities.

06:24:46.972 --> 06:24:56.023
And then, of course, the guidance that the department puts forth to help LEAs implement ESSA in their own local plans is another opportunity.

06:24:57.091 --> 06:24:58.952
I'm going to go through them pretty quickly.

06:24:59.593 --> 06:25:06.997
Section 6303 of the ESSA describes the 7% required set aside.

06:25:08.258 --> 06:25:15.903
That money is to be used to provide technical assistance and supports to schools that have been identified for comprehensive and targeted support and improvement activities.

06:25:16.723 --> 06:25:23.167
So 95% of that 7% must be subgranted to LEAs, either by a formula or on a competitive basis.

06:25:24.728 --> 06:25:38.653
The formula grant would ensure that all the LEAs who are eligible for additional supports would receive additional resources, but a competitive grant would allow the state to target LEAs determined most likely to be successful based on their grant applications.

06:25:39.513 --> 06:25:48.216
If the state decides to pursue the competitive grant option, it has the opportunity to design an RFA that would be aligned to the state priorities.

06:25:51.767 --> 06:26:00.117
Section 6303B gives states the option to set aside an additional 3% of the LEA subgrant allocation for direct student services.

06:26:00.658 --> 06:26:06.404
Allowable activities include credit recovery in support of advanced placement and international baccalaureate programs.

06:26:07.145 --> 06:26:16.332
Although these activities are consistent with state priorities, the CDE would need to review and approve various programs and create a list of programs for which LEAs can choose.

06:26:16.852 --> 06:26:22.036
But still, this is an opportunity for the state to let folks know these are state priorities.

06:26:25.495 --> 06:26:28.737
Title II has a 3% allowable set-aside.

06:26:29.757 --> 06:26:32.239
It would come to about $7 million a year.

06:26:33.519 --> 06:26:38.982
The state could establish programs designed to improve the skills of principals and other leaders.

06:26:39.823 --> 06:26:43.785
They could be used in a variety of ways, including recruitment and retention of school leaders.

06:26:44.345 --> 06:27:00.727
new career paths to school leadership, development of high-quality professional learning programs, and the use of these funds, should the board decide to make use of this allowable set-aside, could also be used in a way to support state priorities.

06:27:03.069 --> 06:27:12.536
And as I mentioned for Titles II, III, and IV, each one of those programs does come with some funding for state-level activities.

06:27:13.156 --> 06:27:25.444
It's important to remember that for each of these programs, the administration of the funds, the distribution, monitoring, and providing technical assistance around appropriate use requires a significant part of the funds.

06:27:27.870 --> 06:27:33.155
And attachment three provides some information around how these funds are currently used.

06:27:33.476 --> 06:27:36.839
So Title II has the most discretionary state-level funding.

06:27:37.420 --> 06:27:50.673
We currently use state-level funds to support the work of the California Subject Matter Project, provide statewide professional development for private school educators, and collect data and provide technical assistance to meet the educator equity requirements of the law.

06:27:52.042 --> 06:27:55.285
There's also a little bit of funding in Title III right now.

06:27:55.765 --> 06:28:05.795
The majority of this funding is used to monitor and provide technical assistance, but these funds are also used to support the Title III regional leads who provide more local technical assistance.

06:28:07.321 --> 06:28:10.022
Title IV is not currently funded until we have a budget.

06:28:10.383 --> 06:28:15.125
We won't know how much the state will receive or how much will be available after the funds are administered.

06:28:15.645 --> 06:28:19.167
As you can see, this is a relatively small amount of funding.

06:28:26.792 --> 06:28:41.142
We have yet to see how that will all shake out, but again, supporting LEAs to use those funds in the ways prescribed by law is probably would be the first priority, and there may be some left over for state-level activities.

06:28:44.104 --> 06:28:46.946
And then, as I mentioned earlier, all California LEAs

06:28:48.146 --> 06:28:51.910
who receive funds are required to develop and implement an LEA plan.

06:28:52.390 --> 06:28:59.717
And within our state plan, we're required to describe how we will support the development, review, and approval of LEA plans.

06:29:00.537 --> 06:29:11.908
So the submission of these new ESSA LEA plans represents an opportunity for the state to support LEAs to be reflective about their planning and align their local planning with state priorities.

06:29:14.082 --> 06:29:23.540
So the next few slides provide the board with a few starting points for discussion around some ways we might leverage ESSA resources across programs to support state priorities.

06:29:25.979 --> 06:29:31.780
One of those ideas that's come up is establishing the California Support Network.

06:29:32.420 --> 06:29:38.042
California's county offices of education are uniquely positioned to provide supports tailored to meet local needs.

06:29:38.902 --> 06:29:51.945
California could use Title I school improvement funds and Title III state-level activity funds to develop the California Support Network, a new network that would be designed to build county office capacity to support LEAs and schools.

06:29:52.945 --> 06:30:06.592
Staff supported with these funds would work with the CDE, the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence, and other existing regional networks to provide integrated support to LEAs and schools based on local needs with a focus on state priorities.

06:30:12.006 --> 06:30:20.455
Many stakeholders expressed the belief that school leadership is key to the success of the school community and were supportive of additional professional learning for principals and school leaders.

06:30:21.275 --> 06:30:33.127
California could use the Title II Part A Optional 3% Set-Aside to establish the California Leadership Initiative, a statewide infrastructure that would build on the successes of the California School Leadership Academy.

06:30:33.948 --> 06:30:38.071
with a renewed focus on equity, standards implementation, and instructional leadership.

06:30:38.751 --> 06:30:47.197
The initiative could focus on leaders in schools identified for targeted and comprehensive supports first, and then expand to serve leaders statewide once established.

06:30:53.442 --> 06:30:54.262
Are you seeing nothing?

06:30:55.623 --> 06:30:56.784
All right, we're going to paper.

06:30:57.024 --> 06:30:57.885
Sorry, audience.

06:30:59.226 --> 06:31:00.887
Unless someone can come out quickly and

06:31:28.729 --> 06:31:28.957
Thank you.

06:31:46.953 --> 06:32:02.426
While she's getting ready, I should say that since we haven't done anything since 2002 on this, all of the applications for all of the titles that all of the local school districts are now holding are defunct.

06:32:03.246 --> 06:32:05.006
So they will have to reapply.

06:32:06.407 --> 06:32:13.848
And so leverage point for us, potentially, is what do we put in those applications?

06:32:15.028 --> 06:32:18.709
Because they applied for NCLB, not for this.

06:32:19.389 --> 06:32:26.490
So we also have a leverage point in the applications and the criteria we would use.

06:32:27.511 --> 06:32:29.611
And as Barbara's slide showed,

06:32:30.236 --> 06:32:35.999
The federal requirements are really pretty open, which we could add to or whatever.

06:32:36.139 --> 06:32:42.221
So this will spring a whole lot of local activity.

06:32:44.182 --> 06:32:54.727
And some of the, I think the local programs, I don't know what the impressions are around the board, have not changed a lot in a very long time.

06:32:55.550 --> 06:33:00.015
and maybe don't reflect the Common Core, everything else we've been doing here.

06:33:00.816 --> 06:33:10.868
So this is a chance for us to shake the tree in federal aid, which has been running somewhat on autopilot for quite a while.

06:33:11.488 --> 06:33:13.190
Since we did not get a waiver,

06:33:14.102 --> 06:33:16.104
We were running under NCLB.

06:33:17.445 --> 06:33:22.250
Every item I can think of on federal aid here was put on consent, mostly.

06:33:23.611 --> 06:33:30.658
And so this board has not dealt with the interstices of federal aid in the five years I've been on it.

06:33:31.218 --> 06:33:31.418
So...

06:33:34.517 --> 06:33:51.387
Anything that's been going on the same track for 14 years, which was an older track, NCLB, is probably not, whatever they were doing, is probably not fully what we would aspire to under the new law.

06:33:52.227 --> 06:33:57.090
So that's just some thinking on the leverage that we have here.

06:33:58.830 --> 06:33:59.710
in regard to this.

06:34:00.731 --> 06:34:02.891
Board Member Williams.

06:34:03.811 --> 06:34:20.415
While we're still waiting for that to come on, I just wanted to share for those of you who might not know, I thought it was very interesting the photo you had of President Johnson, given in particular that President Kirst worked in that administration, did you not, in the Department of Education?

06:34:20.655 --> 06:34:22.656
Yeah, while we're setting this up, I should...

06:34:25.351 --> 06:34:27.172
I should say, I'll tell my story.

06:34:28.612 --> 06:34:29.032
That was 1965.

06:34:29.212 --> 06:34:34.713
I was, and this is part of my vision for what we should do.

06:34:35.293 --> 06:34:39.534
I was the second person hired in the Title I office in Washington.

06:34:40.054 --> 06:34:46.156
And I was sent out to California to review Title I for the US Department of Education in 1965.

06:34:48.276 --> 06:34:58.843
And I met the director of compensatory education, Wilson C. Riles, that some people may remember, and his very peppy young assistant named Marion Joseph.

06:35:00.865 --> 06:35:03.927
And I was dazzled by what they were doing.

06:35:04.527 --> 06:35:14.514
They had taken federal aid and just put a California vision on what they wanted and added dramatically to what the federal base was on applications.

06:35:15.374 --> 06:35:17.755
And I thought, wow, this is really something.

06:35:17.795 --> 06:35:27.619
So I flew back to Washington and said, you should see what they're doing out there with everything else we've seen in other states.

06:35:27.719 --> 06:35:34.062
So anyway, that's a story on my first part with Title I and what California was doing.

06:35:34.142 --> 06:35:42.025
And I would aspire now in some later years that we could approach some of that of what Riles did in that period.

06:35:42.285 --> 06:35:47.758
So my takeaway from that story is we've been through so much together and most of it was your fault.

06:35:49.778 --> 06:35:50.138
Yes.

06:35:51.019 --> 06:35:53.120
We helped set up a system.

06:35:54.582 --> 06:36:04.189
The second trip I had was to the Director of Negro Education in South Carolina, which was a very different experience than California.

06:36:04.209 --> 06:36:07.191
I went from California to South Carolina.

06:36:07.771 --> 06:36:12.555
And so there was a lot of distrust of the states at that time.

06:36:12.655 --> 06:36:15.397
Segregated systems, for example, were still running.

06:36:16.758 --> 06:36:17.158
And so

06:36:18.539 --> 06:36:30.548
The federal administrators, including me, we set up Title I so that the Title I coordinators and the Title I leaders saw Washington as a reference point, not the states.

06:36:30.808 --> 06:36:39.334
So we set up this silo, and that is something I think we're dealing with to this day in that regard.

06:36:39.394 --> 06:36:41.676
So I'm even more compounding the felony.

06:36:41.716 --> 06:36:45.459
But if you were there in 1965, you might have done what we did, too.

06:36:45.859 --> 06:36:49.301
Now, it's probably just a twinkle in your eye in 1965.

06:36:50.502 --> 06:37:02.229
So in my career as a student and as an educator, I've gone from being born in a state that put colored on my birth certificate to being Negro, to being black, to being African-American.

06:37:02.609 --> 06:37:09.493
So even though I can't graduate out of that particular subgroup, things have changed considerably.

06:37:10.154 --> 06:37:12.135
But again, still, most of it was your fault.

06:37:15.552 --> 06:37:21.215
Yeah, I don't know if I can follow these stories.

06:37:21.235 --> 06:37:30.379
So getting back to the presentation, many stakeholders indicated that they wanted more access to resources and additional professional learning opportunities for educators.

06:37:31.039 --> 06:37:44.666
The state could choose to dedicate state-level activity funds towards the development and implementation of Collaboration in Common, an online tool that will support professional learning community practices and facilitate online sharing of resources.

06:37:46.991 --> 06:37:52.316
We heard a strong message from stakeholders that they would like to see a broadening of curriculum under ESSA.

06:37:52.896 --> 06:38:06.628
In keeping with this feedback and building upon the successes of the ELA-ELD framework rollouts, the state might also choose to invest state-level activity funds in similar professional learning opportunities for each of the updated frameworks.

06:38:07.248 --> 06:38:19.538
The state could also use these funds to identify and disseminate high-quality resources and evidence-based practices across the curriculum via conferences, webpages, Collaboration in Common, and My Digital Chalkboard.

06:38:21.730 --> 06:38:27.154
And similarly, many stakeholders would like to see California focus on the whole child a little bit more.

06:38:27.674 --> 06:38:37.860
The state might use state-level activity funds to provide professional learning opportunities and identify and disseminate resources on the non-academic needs of students and families.

06:38:38.821 --> 06:38:50.869
So these are just a few preliminary ideas just to give you a sense that we could use resources from across programs to support whatever it is you believe the state priorities should be.

06:38:53.345 --> 06:39:01.149
So recall during the July meeting, the board suggested that the CDE consult with CCESA and the collaborative regarding opportunities in the ESSA.

06:39:01.790 --> 06:39:14.757
We have arranged to meet with representatives from those organizations on September 19th, and have also expanded that meeting to include representatives from both the Commission on Teacher Credentialing and the California Subject Matter Project.

06:39:16.107 --> 06:39:31.868
This group will use the starting points in Attachment 3 and your input today to develop a set of options for review by the CPAG, who is meeting on September 29th, and for inclusion in a draft as a state plan that we will bring to you for consideration in November.

06:39:34.577 --> 06:39:50.752
So at this point, I'd be happy to address any questions you may have regarding the item and the plan development process, but I also have some questions for you posed by Chief Deputy Price earlier regarding what you would like to see in the plan.

06:39:51.252 --> 06:39:55.096
What overall policy directions should drive ESSA planning?

06:39:56.331 --> 06:40:01.737
What significant statewide programmatic opportunities and priorities should the ESSA plan drive?

06:40:02.317 --> 06:40:10.406
As we think about how to leverage ESSA resources to support state priorities, are there particular priorities that you would like to see in the plan?

06:40:11.658 --> 06:40:16.221
Are there particular program areas or plan requirements that you would like to know more about?

06:40:17.022 --> 06:40:23.286
And finally, what specific input from the CPAG would be most helpful to you in November?

06:40:24.107 --> 06:40:36.275
We are planning to bring them some options as described in Attachment 3 and further developed during the September 19th meeting, but would it be helpful for them to review and provide feedback on the entire draft plan?

06:40:37.075 --> 06:40:40.838
So with that, thank you.

06:40:44.039 --> 06:40:45.380
Okay, board members.

06:40:46.560 --> 06:40:46.820
Pat.

06:40:48.401 --> 06:40:57.505
Okay, so I do have some questions, particularly on, first, I'll thank you for this very comprehensive report and all the materials that you prepared and put in print for us.

06:40:58.205 --> 06:41:05.588
I went through the outline you gave in attachment, I think it's attachment two, that is an outline

06:41:06.108 --> 06:41:16.251
on each of the decision points that are required for both Title I and Title II and then all the successive titles that have to be addressed in the state's comprehensive plan.

06:41:16.651 --> 06:41:25.894
So my question is, for the areas that have been shaded, identified as yellow as in process and the ones that are more orange as in not decided,

06:41:26.814 --> 06:41:29.135
I want to make sure I understand what I just heard you say.

06:41:29.575 --> 06:41:36.397
So on September 19th, there's going to be this joint meeting from a lot of state level agencies.

06:41:36.837 --> 06:41:44.759
And is that where some of these decisions or some of these conversations about what's in this grid that's not yet decided or in process will be?

06:41:44.839 --> 06:41:47.200
Or where will those decisions be made?

06:41:47.280 --> 06:41:50.181
Where's that decision point at?

06:41:50.723 --> 06:41:52.325
Right, thank you for that question.

06:41:53.086 --> 06:42:08.025
So the meeting on September 19th is to look more specifically at use of funds, and there are a number of orange shaded boxes in here which are specifically like how are you planning to use your Title II and associated funds to support

06:42:08.425 --> 06:42:10.426
educator excellence or whatever you're going to support.

06:42:10.906 --> 06:42:29.693
So that meeting, it's the first of probably several meetings, is designed to have folks talk more about what are the possibilities, what are some other options the state could consider around using ESSA funds, ESSA resources to support state priorities.

06:42:30.293 --> 06:42:31.653
And these are starting points.

06:42:31.934 --> 06:42:35.375
The other pieces, there are a lot of orange pieces in here around

06:42:38.243 --> 06:42:42.807
Performance management and LEA plans and other, you know, President Kirst talked about that.

06:42:42.867 --> 06:42:44.989
We haven't really had that conversation, right?

06:42:45.049 --> 06:42:51.254
So the September 19th meeting won't go into that so much as sort of trying to put some meat on the bones.

06:42:51.314 --> 06:42:54.917
If we do want to do a California leadership initiative, what might that look like?

06:42:55.317 --> 06:42:56.498
Who would be involved?

06:42:56.979 --> 06:43:01.883
Who would we target and come forth with some proposals that we could then take to the CPAG and then back to you?

06:43:02.243 --> 06:43:04.445
There wouldn't be everything orange or everything yellow.

06:43:04.665 --> 06:43:21.023
The reason why I was asking in particular about the September 19th meeting and then afterwards, the September 29th meeting, I realized when I was giving my thanks to all the different stakeholder groups and the different types of stakeholder representatives who came to weigh in on the LCAP decision,

06:43:21.904 --> 06:43:26.790
One group that I forgot to speak to was school boards.

06:43:26.810 --> 06:43:39.104
I am quite certain that school boards as a stakeholder have a great concern about some of these decision points because some of this work on crafting that consolidated plan will impact

06:43:39.524 --> 06:43:42.888
some of the work that they have to do in the timeline that they have to address it.

06:43:43.008 --> 06:43:57.183
So probably while you're looking at those statewide policy groups and regulatory agencies that will be doing this work, you might want to look at some of those statewide stakeholder organizations that probably

06:43:57.643 --> 06:44:02.547
should be at some point considered how to engage them in this conversation as well.

06:44:02.587 --> 06:44:11.334
That is my suggestion, more because of the work that is going to be passed on to them at some point, but also the work that the CPAG will also be doing.

06:44:12.656 --> 06:44:16.699
My other question was, as it relates to the work of the CPAG, the

06:44:18.280 --> 06:44:31.865
The impression I had from some of my colleagues who were able to attend the study session in June, the joint study session with the board and the CPAG as the conversation began, is that people felt that that was a very successful opportunity.

06:44:32.345 --> 06:44:37.787
So is there a plan to consider that and to have another one of those types of study sessions again?

06:44:39.485 --> 06:44:39.725
Yes.

06:44:40.125 --> 06:44:48.570
So just yesterday, as we were doing some briefings with the superintendent and CDE leadership around the content, you know, there's a lot in here.

06:44:49.931 --> 06:45:00.998
And not even if we extend our submission by additional time, which is a possibility, depending on what ED does or how the board feels we should proceed, there's still a lot to cover.

06:45:01.498 --> 06:45:03.579
And you all meet every two months.

06:45:04.059 --> 06:45:14.862
So just yesterday I was talking with board staff about the possibility of perhaps joint study sessions with CPAG and or separate study sessions with the board.

06:45:14.882 --> 06:45:19.384
Because there really is a lot and even if we have a longer period of time, there's still a lot.

06:45:21.141 --> 06:45:26.467
And then my final question and this goes really more to a request really to President Kirst.

06:45:26.968 --> 06:45:41.364
My frustration when I came on the board and we were doing on the consent agenda approval of these consolidated applications that really weren't keeping up with the work and the change in direction the state was taking in the same way that we are

06:45:42.064 --> 06:45:54.627
using our flexibility concerning the LCAP to update the three-year template and to make sure that we're continually improving not just how we hold schools accountable but how we help schools do planning.

06:45:55.168 --> 06:46:00.149
I'm hoping that we can look at a way to use a lot of the flexibility we have

06:46:00.649 --> 06:46:27.454
under this new statute for how we monitor revise and continue to evaluate and update this plan also so that there's something built in so that we're holding ourselves accountable not for a plan we wrote 15 years ago but the ways that we monitor and continue to improve the implementation of that plan over time as well so I'm I'd like to see that as something a consideration that's baked in because I think there is some flexibility to consider that as well.

06:46:33.630 --> 06:46:41.639
I'm glad to see that we're going to consider this and not submit until after March, only because I think that it merits a lot of conversations.

06:46:42.199 --> 06:46:50.307
It took me three days to go over the 93 pages because I was trying to really be thoughtful and make sure that I understood everything that was going into this.

06:46:50.968 --> 06:46:59.773
So in that process I did get the idea that some things have been decided mainly because it said decided in some of these categories.

06:47:00.013 --> 06:47:06.957
And I personally almost choked on my cookie when I was reading this when I read the part on about ELs.

06:47:07.137 --> 06:47:16.783
So attachment to page 7 of 30 that states former ELs included an EL subgroup for four years after re-designation in academic indicator.

06:47:17.463 --> 06:47:24.366
That is something that is currently in the draft regs that reclassified students can be included up to four years.

06:47:25.667 --> 06:47:27.888
I think this merits a really big discussion.

06:47:27.908 --> 06:47:42.255
This is the first time that I see this and I would never support it because for me under Title III in order, we should monitor, absolutely let's monitor there and see if after four years they still have access to the core curriculum and they're performing at a

06:47:42.975 --> 06:47:45.257
you know, a level apart with their colleagues.

06:47:46.298 --> 06:47:51.382
But to include it for accountability purposes, that could really mask the performance of current ELs.

06:47:51.782 --> 06:47:55.745
And so we have a work group right now that's getting together for the composite.

06:47:56.205 --> 06:48:03.431
They should be helping inform this, as well as the reclassification, which is something that was also noted as decided.

06:48:04.912 --> 06:48:08.315
ESSA calls for a standard reclassification criteria.

06:48:08.835 --> 06:48:19.378
and the one we cited is the same criteria that we currently have, which is the same criteria that everyone pretty much agrees gives you a fragmented reclassification process across the state.

06:48:19.898 --> 06:48:24.939
So how can that be our criteria that standardizes the practice of reclassification?

06:48:25.740 --> 06:48:30.361
Then if we take component four of the criteria, also per ESSA,

06:48:31.241 --> 06:48:39.868
we're left with assessment or proficiency rates of the assessment, which will eventually be LPAC, teacher evaluation, and parent opinion.

06:48:40.588 --> 06:48:42.250
We don't have an LPAC assessment.

06:48:42.310 --> 06:48:44.872
How do we know what proficiency would look like?

06:48:46.113 --> 06:48:50.256
Again, I think that some of these decisions that have been decided, I'm not sure

06:48:51.517 --> 06:48:59.480
who decided and, you know, I think we have a great opportunity right now to really rethink what is a solid reclassification process.

06:49:00.060 --> 06:49:09.284
And citing the same criteria that has created so many different systems of reclassification across the state is probably not the best starting point.

06:49:10.504 --> 06:49:12.345
maybe eliminating one of those will be.

06:49:12.465 --> 06:49:12.805
I don't know.

06:49:12.845 --> 06:49:13.906
I think that we should ask.

06:49:14.926 --> 06:49:19.888
And then the last one is they asked about assessment in a language other than English.

06:49:20.028 --> 06:49:21.489
We do have the Spanish assessment.

06:49:21.849 --> 06:49:24.690
We don't know if it's going to be used for accountability purposes.

06:49:24.790 --> 06:49:26.731
We have to wait for the assessment regulations.

06:49:27.151 --> 06:49:29.252
But we are, we do have something.

06:49:29.292 --> 06:49:32.934
So why not note it in this, in this section.

06:49:35.026 --> 06:49:40.169
piece about the language assessment other than English.

06:49:40.929 --> 06:49:46.412
I think we're not really sure how we're going to go, just as you just said, until we have the final assessment regulations.

06:49:46.632 --> 06:49:53.016
So it's one of those things where we think we know where we're going to go, but we're not entirely sure until we have the final regs.

06:49:53.996 --> 06:50:09.001
Getting back to the academic indicator that you pointed out on page seven, we actually had a conversation about this last week with Director Aguila from English Learner Support and Jenny and I sat down and we tried to figure out where are we with this because someone said, what is this?

06:50:09.921 --> 06:50:17.123
And we thought about reposting the entire item to rephrase it and then thought, oh, that would be bad to have 91 pages times two.

06:50:17.924 --> 06:50:22.325
So if we move for purposes of the academic indicator,

06:50:23.567 --> 06:50:24.788
to the front of that phrase?

06:50:25.329 --> 06:50:31.254
For purposes of the academic indicator, former ELs included in the EL subgroup for four years after redesignation.

06:50:31.294 --> 06:50:34.156
Does that then make feel more decided to you?

06:50:34.176 --> 06:50:37.139
Because it felt decided to, no?

06:50:38.220 --> 06:50:40.202
It wasn't about the English learner.

06:50:41.354 --> 06:50:43.975
indicator, it's about the academic indicator.

06:50:44.015 --> 06:50:54.160
Right, but you're saying that we would include somebody, a student who reclassified, four years later will still be included in the EL subgroup for ELA and math.

06:50:55.061 --> 06:51:03.445
It's still the same problem, we still are masking what do the current ELs, where are they performing in terms of math and EL?

06:51:06.346 --> 06:51:08.407
No, for Title III, there's no accountability.

06:51:08.567 --> 06:51:17.692
Title III is reporting, now it's in Title I. And so that is, you know, a huge conversation that needs to take place.

06:51:17.912 --> 06:51:26.316
Monitoring, yes, for Title III, for the purposes of monitoring these students one year after reclassification, two, three, four, we do want to know that.

06:51:26.676 --> 06:51:28.837
We want to see where did these students go?

06:51:28.857 --> 06:51:31.257
Did we reclassify them prematurely?

06:51:31.518 --> 06:51:33.678
Were they ready to access the core curriculum?

06:51:33.998 --> 06:51:42.461
But for accountability purposes, I think that it would completely mask the performance of current ELs if we're also including reclassified students in that subgroup.

06:51:42.661 --> 06:51:42.961
All right.

06:51:43.001 --> 06:51:44.121
Well, thank you for that input.

06:51:44.221 --> 06:51:50.163
And I will continue the conversation both between board meetings and at the next board meeting.

06:51:50.243 --> 06:51:55.285
On the CPAG, I have a request for the local people who are in local school districts.

06:51:56.209 --> 06:52:04.945
that you ask them to come prepared, what are they now spending their money on in Title I, and how effective do they think it is?

06:52:06.898 --> 06:52:11.900
I need to get a better handle on what is out there."

06:52:13.061 --> 06:52:19.943
Get them to look inwardly and say, what are we doing here in our own district and how effective is it?

06:52:20.964 --> 06:52:26.186
Ask them if anybody has firsthand information of that by local districts.

06:52:27.066 --> 06:52:33.611
I would appreciate just, you know, I need to get more information on what is before I get to what ought.

06:52:33.751 --> 06:52:38.013
You know, I have imagined what is, but I can't, I don't have any real data.

06:52:39.161 --> 06:52:40.161
Board member Holliday.

06:52:40.461 --> 06:52:43.742
I was trying to stay at the 30,000 foot level as you asked us to do.

06:52:43.762 --> 06:52:58.584
I wanted to just indicate that, as President Kerr said earlier, there is a tremendous need for capacity building in order to address this achievement gap that is so stubborn.

06:52:59.005 --> 06:53:04.485
And I think we're hearing from a lot of people the same question.

06:53:05.026 --> 06:53:05.666
What works?

06:53:07.446 --> 06:53:07.946
Can I do?

06:53:08.146 --> 06:53:08.987
I'm ready to do it.

06:53:09.207 --> 06:53:10.248
I got money now to do it.

06:53:10.308 --> 06:53:11.128
I'm ready to do it.

06:53:11.308 --> 06:53:11.949
What's going to work?

06:53:12.529 --> 06:53:36.163
So if there were a way that each of these titles, and I know it's impossible to do all of them, but if we could somehow think about how each one of these title monies could build upon each other in that same capacity building goal, I think we might get a lot better idea how effective this money

06:53:38.164 --> 06:53:49.555
When you look at tossing, say, 4 million or 5 million, billion, sorry, at one issue, capacity building, right?

06:53:50.936 --> 06:53:54.839
You might actually move the rock a little ways as opposed to a little here and a little here and a little.

06:53:55.060 --> 06:53:57.862
So that would just be sort of my 30,000 foot look at it.

06:54:01.546 --> 06:54:08.533
Actually, we are actually in alignment on our conversation is that so much of categorical is siloed.

06:54:08.873 --> 06:54:11.956
So when you're managing it, you're like, okay, I got money for this program.

06:54:11.976 --> 06:54:12.957
I have nutrition over here.

06:54:13.017 --> 06:54:13.598
I have tech.

06:54:13.958 --> 06:54:16.861
So what we're trying to do is make a coherent system.

06:54:16.921 --> 06:54:25.289
And what member holiday was saying, I just want to build on which is we're trying to improve capacity and practice to improve outcomes for kids.

06:54:25.769 --> 06:54:33.431
And so we got, we have LCFF money and there's obviously districts are identifying, they're identifying gaps and they're focusing on what to do.

06:54:33.852 --> 06:54:39.293
We put additional $1,400 in educator one time to improve practice for PD.

06:54:40.434 --> 06:54:47.796
Title II I know was my favorite use of money when I had a local budget because I had opportunities to improve practice.

06:54:48.136 --> 06:54:51.577
But I think at some point along the way we need to look holistically

06:54:52.017 --> 06:55:17.195
how are we improving practice and how do different pieces, obviously, Migrant Ed needs a target, different, there are different titles that have particular focus, but when you think about the core teacher in the classroom who now has first core instruction for Yale students, for special needs students, for diverse learners, it's changed from siloed where you just sent kids out to get treatment and you in the core just did,

06:55:17.495 --> 06:55:24.380
We're asking that every one of our frameworks to support English learners with extra strategies and helping build capacity.

06:55:24.421 --> 06:55:28.424
But teachers take time to learn some of this and leaders as well.

06:55:28.484 --> 06:55:33.648
So I would like in the process and one of our board updates and in some of our working groups,

06:55:34.188 --> 06:55:43.374
to take a holistic look at improving capacity of districts, of leaders, and of classroom teachers, and how all the pieces.

06:55:43.394 --> 06:55:51.559
I mean, I think I loved your graphic, which supports what Member Bersman's saying about the small percentage is federal money and how much we are

06:55:52.199 --> 06:55:54.280
targeting and our state responsibility.

06:55:54.600 --> 06:56:00.883
So I just think as we talk about professional practice, which is how you improve outcome, I think we ought to look at the whole picture.

06:56:00.943 --> 06:56:06.325
So I think that's just an ongoing project as we take a look at the funds and our goals.

06:56:06.805 --> 06:56:07.045
Thank you.

06:56:09.560 --> 06:56:11.804
Other board member comments.

06:56:13.467 --> 06:56:17.935
Board member Ortiz-Lacon mentioned the reports on Title III.

06:56:18.777 --> 06:56:22.203
So we've been getting these, just using that as an example.

06:56:23.248 --> 06:56:41.023
So the local districts file these, so there's the application process, that's a leverage point, then they file these reports on these various titles and they're going somewhere in CDE, I'm not quite sure where, but we, and under NCLB it wasn't, you know, any particular need to

06:56:41.864 --> 06:56:42.825
do much about them.

06:56:42.905 --> 06:56:49.768
But seems to me we could also think about reviewing the various reports that there come in.

06:56:49.868 --> 06:57:01.653
So some listing at some point of not just of what what's on the what kind of reports do they make on this and just let's say a title three report looks really bad.

06:57:01.913 --> 06:57:03.574
We could say we don't accept this.

06:57:04.834 --> 06:57:08.056
We want you to you know we want to talk about this or we want you to see

06:57:09.716 --> 06:57:12.557
think about reprogramming your funds or something of that sort.

06:57:13.158 --> 06:57:17.699
So that the reporting is not just a passive compliance document.

06:57:18.159 --> 06:57:25.502
It can be used as, are they on track in that regard?

06:57:25.582 --> 06:57:30.344
So that's another thing I think to think about is what are they required to do?

06:57:31.524 --> 06:57:42.954
The big issue that is somewhat stumping me, a big issue, is how does all this relate to the LCAP?

06:57:43.034 --> 06:57:46.817
We want to have a unified federal state local system.

06:57:47.838 --> 06:57:52.202
Now, we have to approve these Title I applications as a state board.

06:57:52.242 --> 06:57:53.984
We're the state education agency.

06:57:55.865 --> 06:57:57.847
We want to make it congruent with the LCAP.

06:58:00.222 --> 06:58:07.107
the statute, and I don't think the board or the department, want to get into approving all the local LCAPs.

06:58:08.568 --> 06:58:17.033
So how do you have an integrated system where, you know, the responsibility is somewhat bifurcated?

06:58:17.073 --> 06:58:19.234
I'm sure we can work it out.

06:58:19.695 --> 06:58:22.977
And then if we try and tack the federal aid stuff

06:58:24.301 --> 06:58:28.825
On to the LCAP, it's going to get starting to get real large again.

06:58:28.845 --> 06:58:36.251
And, you know, we'll approach, you know, even higher numbers of hundreds of pages.

06:58:36.351 --> 06:58:39.433
And so that is a problem.

06:58:39.513 --> 06:58:41.595
I mean, you can overburden the LCAP.

06:58:43.875 --> 06:58:47.817
The LCAP is not categorical funds in its thinking.

06:58:48.057 --> 06:58:49.718
This is categorical funds.

06:58:50.298 --> 06:58:51.859
These are categorical funds.

06:58:53.259 --> 06:59:00.002
So I'm a bit muddled on this and I think it's a real dicey question.

06:59:00.882 --> 06:59:10.473
Now, the local plans that we've been talking about, the local education plans, those are required through federal, those are required, those are complying with federal aid, right?

06:59:10.613 --> 06:59:19.223
So, okay, you got a local education plan for categorical money, which is an application process,

06:59:22.325 --> 06:59:25.145
And then you want it to be integrated with the LCAP.

06:59:25.185 --> 06:59:28.486
So this is something for the board to figure out.

06:59:28.566 --> 06:59:30.386
I'm not smart enough to figure it out.

06:59:30.446 --> 06:59:33.987
So somebody has to think this through.

06:59:34.027 --> 06:59:40.868
But I'm a little, I'm just laying out some of the bigger issues that we have thought about.

06:59:47.279 --> 06:59:50.823
The local education plans are just on the federal funding.

06:59:50.843 --> 06:59:54.247
So I'm back to.

06:59:54.267 --> 06:59:56.290
He's shaking his head yes for the audience.

06:59:56.330 --> 06:59:56.550
Yeah.

06:59:56.630 --> 06:59:57.371
Glenn is saying yes.

06:59:57.391 --> 06:59:58.853
Chief Deputy is saying yes.

07:00:00.760 --> 07:00:08.045
I'm sort of back on this notion of this is an awful lot of work for a little tiny bit of money for an LEA.

07:00:08.125 --> 07:00:16.571
I mean, if you break down, it's 10% statewide, you break it down at the district level, I would be going, I don't want the money.

07:00:17.491 --> 07:00:19.112
It's not worth the headache, honestly.

07:00:20.873 --> 07:00:35.498
What was really helpful about showing the 1965 activity, at that time it was big money and it was the only money that supported the kind of equity considerations that we have been working on now for several years.

07:00:37.219 --> 07:00:58.582
I appreciate the conundrum, President Kirst, but I think we have to think about it again in the context of how much LEAs are really getting out of it and how much we want to demand of them or how much time our staff should be spending, our collective staff, on sort of chasing their tail a little bit here.

07:01:00.771 --> 07:01:00.992
Right.

07:01:01.232 --> 07:01:02.112
That's one to consider.

07:01:02.152 --> 07:01:10.377
On the other hand, you have an objective of, well, this needs to be rethought at the local level because they were operating under an entirely different system.

07:01:11.438 --> 07:01:14.840
So if you don't have some

07:01:16.221 --> 07:01:21.143
state policy, it'll probably just go on the way it's been going on.

07:01:21.623 --> 07:01:30.966
I interviewed a local administrator in two large systems and asked him about federal aid, and he said, well, we just sort of put that aside, you know, it's sort of running on autopilot.

07:01:33.127 --> 07:01:38.269
But there may be one way in, and I think this is what Glenn is trying to keep reinforcing for us.

07:01:38.689 --> 07:01:40.950
I'm sure I'm trying to get it through my head.

07:01:42.330 --> 07:01:51.353
In this transition plan, we told the Feds we are going to use the LCAP as the LEA plan because that is what we believe in and what we think is the most important.

07:01:52.413 --> 07:01:55.914
I would suggest we want to continue that so there is no duplication.

07:01:57.115 --> 07:02:05.597
Whatever the locals have to submit to us, there is a box that says I certify that this is aligned with my LCAP or this is my LCAP.

07:02:06.078 --> 07:02:12.225
and it represents all the funding that I'm getting through LCFF and whatever you have to do for federal money.

07:02:13.226 --> 07:02:18.151
It's not a dual process that we're approving some federal plan.

07:02:20.173 --> 07:02:21.214
Anyway, that's just a thought.

07:02:28.319 --> 07:02:43.160
I think Glenn and Barbara could probably shed some light on this as the process goes forward, but I am quite certain there are some elements that are common in the template for our LCAP that are also common

07:02:43.741 --> 07:02:50.289
in what would be required or asked of the locals to submit for their consolidated application.

07:02:50.750 --> 07:03:02.724
And so that maybe, and I hear what Board Member Burr is saying, is that in asking the LEAs to do this work, we're not asking them to do something else, something more, or something different.

07:03:03.144 --> 07:03:25.371
if there's a way to create a style guide or a template that populates the consolidated application template from what's developed in the LCAP since we've already said in our state transition plan that our LCAP is going to be our guiding document, if there's a way for us to craft the consolidated application template so it's populated

07:03:25.811 --> 07:03:27.652
from what is written into the LCAP.

07:03:27.752 --> 07:03:31.553
Maybe that can simplify some portions of this process.

07:03:31.933 --> 07:03:46.577
And if there's some work that the state can also do for common planning requirements or common requests that all the LEAs have to submit in the consolidated application, are there things that the state can populate into that application or that template?

07:03:46.897 --> 07:03:57.921
If we can think about building that out and designing it in that way, that might satisfy or at least resolve the complication of the something more, something else, something different.

07:04:01.862 --> 07:04:09.785
I would definitely say there are some key strategic questions that are going to need to come to the board, but they're not insurmountable and we're going to need to think really creatively.

07:04:09.805 --> 07:04:16.367
Number one, just recognize and remember that the board is already approving the LEA plans that are coming in.

07:04:17.067 --> 07:04:21.609
and it's coming periodically and you approve them on your agenda.

07:04:22.589 --> 07:04:32.752
We could look at a situation where we devolve or push out that approval responsibility to the counties together with the LCAPs.

07:04:32.792 --> 07:04:35.793
Could be one pathway for the board to think about.

07:04:35.813 --> 07:04:41.915
We'd have to talk to the Department of Education about that and gain their approval, but that could be a way to go.

07:04:42.535 --> 07:04:49.661
You know, while the funds in Barbara's chart is really instructive, you know, look small.

07:04:49.842 --> 07:04:59.330
They also are, for a lot of people, very significant in that these are resources that can be used very strategically for specific purposes, and I think it's also important to remember that

07:05:00.050 --> 07:05:08.298
They're targeted at the same population that's a priority for the state and unduplicated pupils in terms of our low-income children in the state of California.

07:05:08.358 --> 07:05:13.563
So we have two plans that are directed at a similar population.

07:05:14.243 --> 07:05:23.452
It would really behoove us to be able to integrate and align the work that's going on so that we're getting and leveraging as much as possible of those resources.

07:05:25.305 --> 07:05:26.987
So I agree with you, President Curtis.

07:05:27.087 --> 07:05:36.375
It's going to require some real creative thinking, and it's going to require us putting some real sharp pencils to paper or bytes to keyboards.

07:05:37.496 --> 07:05:43.741
But I think we can do it using the same creativity that we've been using to solve these problems as we've been going along.

07:05:45.823 --> 07:05:46.464
Ortiz, I'll come.

07:05:49.235 --> 07:06:02.347
Yeah, I think I just wanted to make the same point that even though in terms of the money that California has invested, this might look like budget dust, I believe is what board member Burr calls it.

07:06:05.930 --> 07:06:08.933
One, it has the spirit of civil rights for these students.

07:06:09.453 --> 07:06:15.097
Before LCFF, this was the money that helped some of the students that it was meant to.

07:06:15.618 --> 07:06:18.060
You know, LCFF has been in place for not that many years.

07:06:18.100 --> 07:06:19.160
This has been in place since the 60s.

07:06:20.001 --> 07:06:24.585
So it's a reminder that this is an obligation to help these students.

07:06:24.985 --> 07:06:38.375
Now if it was to, and I do think that we need to streamline it, but if it ended up in the LCAP template then we really need to make sure that that we show how the money is being used to improve and increase outcomes.

07:06:38.955 --> 07:06:42.198
There has to be a very clear, this is the money,

07:06:42.938 --> 07:06:43.839
This is the subgroups.

07:06:44.099 --> 07:06:44.840
These are the outcomes.

07:06:45.200 --> 07:06:53.889
Because even under LCFF that has been a consistent complaint that we're not clearly showing how the money is truly benefiting the students that generate it.

07:06:54.290 --> 07:07:01.137
So I can't imagine trying to scale that to federal funds and not be accountable or have a direct way of showing how the money is being used.

07:07:02.452 --> 07:07:08.697
Which is, as you all know, precisely one of the challenges that we're confronting with the LCAP template as well.

07:07:09.177 --> 07:07:17.283
So we can confront this together, and it's a wonderful opportunity to be having it at the same time, because it will allow LEAs to leverage all these resources together.

07:07:19.326 --> 07:07:31.898
In the SAS accounting codes, maybe Member Burr or the department knows this, are the federal funds separate, what do you call them, separate resources, separate codes?

07:07:31.938 --> 07:07:38.324
This goes back to your point, Feliza, that they are coded in the accounting.

07:07:39.505 --> 07:07:42.308
So you have more

07:07:43.228 --> 07:07:49.670
Transparency on them because they're separate codes in the SAS code So, you know, okay.

07:07:49.690 --> 07:07:51.430
I just want to check that in my thinking.

07:07:51.470 --> 07:07:59.753
Yeah Because we got rid a lot of the categorical codes with LCFF But of course we did not and should not get rid of the federal codes.

07:07:59.833 --> 07:08:07.175
Yeah Other any other board comments on this do we have public testimony on this item?

07:08:10.500 --> 07:08:13.102
If the following people would please come to the podium.

07:08:13.802 --> 07:08:16.023
We don't have numbers for this one, I don't think, right?

07:08:16.083 --> 07:08:32.973
Hannah Midnick, Matthew Diaz, Shelly Spiegel-Coleman, Patty Scripter, Lee Angela Reed, Mary Stiers, Doug McCray, and one name I can't read, PTA, everybody come forward, Brad Strong, Eric Premack.

07:08:33.573 --> 07:08:35.014
Please line up everyone who signed up.

07:08:37.315 --> 07:08:38.536
You have one minute of time.

07:08:39.482 --> 07:08:41.603
Hannah Melnick from the Learning Policy Institute.

07:08:41.623 --> 07:08:42.283
Good afternoon.

07:08:42.724 --> 07:08:47.346
We'd like to thank the board for your commitment to a multiple measure system and share three comments.

07:08:48.066 --> 07:08:55.610
First, we'd like to recommend that California take advantage of the optional Title II set aside to support school leadership.

07:08:56.171 --> 07:09:01.033
California has had no statewide infrastructure to support principal training since 2003.

07:09:02.794 --> 07:09:06.638
Research shows that strong school leaders are critical for retaining teachers.

07:09:07.059 --> 07:09:10.482
This investment could help California reduce its teacher shortage.

07:09:11.343 --> 07:09:20.153
Second, we fully support the board and CDE's position that ESSA does not and should not require states to issue a single summative score to each school.

07:09:20.813 --> 07:09:22.235
Our letter and comments to the U.S.

07:09:22.255 --> 07:09:23.676
Department of Ed explain why.

07:09:24.517 --> 07:09:32.521
Third, we explain – we agree that the final regulation should ensure that non-academic indicators are meaningful in the components of the accountability system.

07:09:33.121 --> 07:09:38.623
Research from CORE shows that the proposed regulations would result in these measures being weighted close to zero.

07:09:39.284 --> 07:09:45.827
Stakeholders have made it clear that these measures, such as suspension rates, surveys, and the CCI, should count.

07:09:46.147 --> 07:09:46.487
Thank you.

07:09:50.990 --> 07:09:55.235
Martha Zaragoza-Diaz, representing California Association for Bilingual Education.

07:09:55.255 --> 07:09:56.316
I have three comments.

07:09:56.376 --> 07:10:07.969
The first one is with regards to Title III, Part A, page 25, the third block where it says California will seek legislation to amend Criterion 4.

07:10:08.810 --> 07:10:10.471
the status that that's been decided.

07:10:10.692 --> 07:10:13.053
I would like for you all to consider revisiting that.

07:10:13.594 --> 07:10:24.081
I don't recall the State Board of Education approving legislation to amend Criterion 4 and I would like to know what that looks like and so I think that needs to be revisited.

07:10:24.742 --> 07:10:26.903
The other action is with regards to the

07:10:30.251 --> 07:10:37.259
English learners statewide uniform procedures for former ELs, page 7 of attachment 2.

07:10:37.459 --> 07:10:44.788
Again, we don't believe that combining the two cohorts, ELs and RFEPs,

07:10:45.428 --> 07:10:48.291
into one for academic indicators is a good idea.

07:10:48.471 --> 07:10:53.115
It will mask the actual performance of English learners that are not our FEPs.

07:10:53.416 --> 07:10:58.040
And my last comment is in regards to the assessment in languages other than English.

07:10:58.620 --> 07:11:06.648
Page five, we would like for you to please consider including the California Spanish assessment in the accountability system.

07:11:07.188 --> 07:11:12.550
We believe that the intent of ESSA allows for native language assessments.

07:11:13.150 --> 07:11:26.414
They currently in the proposed reg state that ELs who are not proficient in English can be exempted from the English only assessment for up to five years and they can use a native language assessment.

07:11:26.494 --> 07:11:30.996
So we would like your consideration for inclusion of CSA in the accountability system.

07:11:31.116 --> 07:11:31.376
Thank you.

07:11:35.489 --> 07:11:38.331
Good afternoon, Shelly Spiegel Coleman, Californians Together.

07:11:39.011 --> 07:11:48.957
Just in terms of this previous conversation that you have, I think we need to make it clear that for Title III, written into Title III of ESSA is supplement, not supplant.

07:11:49.277 --> 07:11:55.041
I know there are regs out for the whole issue of supplement for supplant, but for Title III, it's written into the language.

07:11:55.461 --> 07:12:01.665
And so including them in the LCAP would be a good idea, but districts would have to actually write to the four

07:12:02.485 --> 07:12:10.709
the four purposes of Title III in their LCAPs and then show that these funds are supplementing what the districts are already doing in those four areas.

07:12:11.109 --> 07:12:15.791
And so in the redesign of the LCAP, we really think that needs to be taken into consideration.

07:12:16.191 --> 07:12:20.833
The other thing is the state's doing some wonderful things for English learners that we think need to be in this plan.

07:12:21.153 --> 07:12:26.716
When we talked about opportunities, Glenn, that one is our superintendent talked about the EL roadmap.

07:12:27.636 --> 07:12:32.358
And I think that roadmap has a definite place in the ESSA plan.

07:12:32.698 --> 07:12:48.785
The other thing is using Title III funds, which really means it should be in the plan, is the new video series on integrated versus designated ELD and the updated document on research-based promising practices for English learners, a new publication the department is doing.

07:12:49.125 --> 07:12:51.887
All of that should be in the title, should be in the ESSA plan.

07:12:51.967 --> 07:12:52.667
Thank you very much.

07:12:57.042 --> 07:12:57.682
Good afternoon.

07:12:57.983 --> 07:13:01.865
I'm Mary Stiers, the Director of School Support for the Stanislaus County Office of Education.

07:13:02.406 --> 07:13:07.049
My role is to support our 25 districts state and federal program directors.

07:13:07.469 --> 07:13:09.571
I myself was a state and federal program director.

07:13:10.511 --> 07:13:16.376
I also periodically meet with my county colleagues who also support state and federal program directors.

07:13:17.435 --> 07:13:29.739
A couple of things that we have some questions on and some concerns about is the optional 3% for direct student services that is optional for the state to reserve.

07:13:30.300 --> 07:13:39.383
I'm not sure districts are very widely informed as to the meaning of this and that it is for direct student support services that the

07:13:40.043 --> 07:13:43.606
state board would need to determine providers.

07:13:44.047 --> 07:13:51.553
And I'm fearful that we are going to go down the path of supplemental educational services providers, which we know was not effective.

07:13:52.274 --> 07:14:01.682
So I would request that that money not be reserved off the top and that we honor our local control with our districts making those decisions.

07:14:01.923 --> 07:14:02.203
Thank you.

07:14:06.279 --> 07:14:11.263
Good afternoon, Doug McRae, a retired test specialist from Monterey.

07:14:12.263 --> 07:14:28.714
Given the current developmental state for metrics needed for assessment and accountability portions of ESSA, it would seem wise to lobby for delay in implementation of the plan until the 18-19 school year with status information based on spring 18 data and change on spring 19.

07:14:29.315 --> 07:14:35.679
To rush implementation before necessary assessment and accountability metrics are ready for prime time is not a wise choice.

07:14:37.340 --> 07:14:58.994
With the increasing speculation that ESSA regulations will be pushed over to the new administration, with the usual six-month delay to fill chairs at ED in Washington, D.C., and then for the new staff to find the bathrooms, a delay to the 18-19 school years, the first implementation year of ESSA,

07:14:59.514 --> 07:15:00.454
is more than possible.

07:15:01.335 --> 07:15:07.858
Finally, I'd note the same kinds of delays took place for NCLB back in implementation.

07:15:07.918 --> 07:15:10.539
It's not for about three years after the legislation.

07:15:11.359 --> 07:15:11.659
Thank you.

07:15:15.521 --> 07:15:17.282
Patty Scripter, California State PTA.

07:15:17.322 --> 07:15:23.585
I just want to take this opportunity during the ESSA update to thank you again for your letter to the

07:15:24.406 --> 07:15:31.148
Federal Department of Education clearly stating that California is going to continue on the path to a multiple measure system.

07:15:31.548 --> 07:15:33.609
That's something we've supported from the very beginning.

07:15:34.429 --> 07:15:47.013
Accountability based on multiple measures more clearly reflects what's happening in our schools and your letter and vote today recognizes that a single rating system can mask strengths, areas of need, and gaps in opportunity and achievement.

07:15:47.693 --> 07:15:53.435
Once a school's degree of success is reduced to a single number or descriptor, that becomes the label and identity of the school.

07:15:54.531 --> 07:15:56.552
within the education community and the public.

07:15:57.313 --> 07:16:10.382
I think back to the student council presentation at a previous meeting where the student rep on accountability implored the SBE not to do a ranking system because it was very negative to student culture and school climate.

07:16:10.742 --> 07:16:14.425
So we really want to thank you for continuing on the path of what's right for California students.

07:16:16.704 --> 07:16:20.705
President Kirsch, Superintendent Torlakson, members of the board, Brad Strong with Children Now.

07:16:21.365 --> 07:16:30.327
At the start of the presentation, I was nice to see President Obama's statement about the purpose of ESSA.

07:16:31.267 --> 07:16:41.930
And it really comes down to, it's about the educational rights and inequities and ensuring that those are monitored and addressed and that those

07:16:42.450 --> 07:16:51.576
Those inequities, regardless of whether it's academic, discipline, those inequities are identified and addressed.

07:16:51.796 --> 07:16:59.261
On behalf of 26 organizations, we submitted a letter related to the educator equity plan.

07:16:59.361 --> 07:17:03.443
So in 2015, the state had adopted an educator equity plan.

07:17:04.044 --> 07:17:10.428
The No Child Left Behind only dealt with highly qualified teachers, different definition, no longer a requirement.

07:17:11.228 --> 07:17:13.430
every student succeeds, changes the definition.

07:17:13.910 --> 07:17:31.824
And so what this letter is really asking, it's really about ensuring that there is some local monitoring approach, not just addressing the entire pipeline, but really driving into equitable plan for quality educators.

07:17:31.844 --> 07:17:32.124
Thank you.

07:17:35.157 --> 07:17:36.478
Eric Premack, Charter School Center.

07:17:37.018 --> 07:17:54.331
While I can't hang with Grandpa Kirsten Channel all the way back to 64, because you would measure my age in months back then, not years, I can remember back to 2002 when Richard Whitmore and Ray Belisle were furiously trying to put the state plan together back then.

07:17:55.011 --> 07:17:57.973
And we tried to get them, work with them on the charter fit into it.

07:17:58.013 --> 07:18:01.636
We weren't able to do it because they were just overwhelmed with the whole process.

07:18:01.696 --> 07:18:02.817
I'm kind of feeling like

07:18:03.359 --> 07:18:17.524
We may be putting a needle back into that groove, hoping that we can avoid some of the conflicts that have been with us now for 14 years that have been very messy, offer any assistance we can provide in terms of smoothing that out.

07:18:18.965 --> 07:18:38.008
I think about 99.9% of my clients would say we would rather have off-the-top money go to us rather than to the usual suspects, some of who are helpful, some of whom are not, and rather have a few thousand bucks here than somebody else deciding for me somewhere else.

07:18:38.229 --> 07:18:38.489
Thank you.

07:18:42.603 --> 07:18:45.085
Good afternoon President Kerr, Superintendent Torlakson, members.

07:18:45.685 --> 07:18:48.747
LeAngela Reed on behalf of the California Association for the Gifted.

07:18:48.767 --> 07:19:00.194
We're very excited about about some parts of ESSA in that they actually it actually recognizes gifted students for the first time in kind of the

07:19:01.795 --> 07:19:05.137
in the federal law, certainly it wasn't in NCLB.

07:19:05.497 --> 07:19:06.678
So we think it's an opportunity.

07:19:07.038 --> 07:19:13.562
In Title I, there's some opportunities for reporting disaggregated data for students, including gifted students.

07:19:13.602 --> 07:19:17.064
In Title II, there's some requirements relative to teachers.

07:19:17.104 --> 07:19:29.451
We think it will help us to expand our informal identification and we look forward to working with Barb and the CDE staff on moving forward and trying to provide a resource so we can make sure all students are getting the services they need.

07:19:29.671 --> 07:19:29.891
Thanks.

07:19:33.126 --> 07:19:37.250
Good afternoon, Marta Alvarez on behalf of ACCSA, the Association of California School Administrators.

07:19:37.650 --> 07:19:49.021
We really appreciate the staff's comprehensive overview of the decision-making points for the State Board regarding the ESSA State Plan, 96 pages that we will be continuing to review over the next several weeks.

07:19:49.501 --> 07:19:59.650
But I think that will be an opportunity for our members to really be able to provide feedback to you about the decision points regarding the funding that set aside the California we're putting aside for different programs.

07:20:00.151 --> 07:20:03.854
We have a history at AXA providing professional opportunities for our administrators.

07:20:04.294 --> 07:20:09.339
And so we want to be part of that conversation and thinking about how to utilize that money and how to leverage it at the local level.

07:20:10.160 --> 07:20:13.042
We will be having a webinar with our members on October 18th.

07:20:13.402 --> 07:20:17.166
So to the extent that you have questions you want us to ask the administrators, let us know.

07:20:17.586 --> 07:20:21.109
We have more than 120 so far registered to be part of that conversation.

07:20:21.129 --> 07:20:24.512
I really want to thank you and want to be part of the conversation moving forward.

07:20:24.853 --> 07:20:25.073
Thanks.

07:20:29.218 --> 07:20:36.482
Okay, I think that concludes the public testimony, and so we're on to SBE priorities.

07:20:36.622 --> 07:20:40.525
So let's have the rundown there.

07:20:40.625 --> 07:20:41.585
I have the list.

07:20:42.205 --> 07:20:43.826
First we have to approve the minutes, right?

07:20:45.347 --> 07:20:46.208
Yes, okay.

07:20:48.129 --> 07:20:49.810
So do I have a motion to approve the minutes?

07:20:50.910 --> 07:20:52.111
I move adoption of the minutes.

07:20:52.852 --> 07:20:53.172
Second?

07:20:54.116 --> 07:20:56.799
All right, any public comment on our minutes?

07:20:57.740 --> 07:20:59.521
Okay, if not, everybody ready?

07:20:59.681 --> 07:21:01.203
If it approves, raise your hand.

07:21:01.223 --> 07:21:03.045
Okay, they are approved.

07:21:03.065 --> 07:21:05.887
Okay, so updates here.

07:21:08.590 --> 07:21:10.272
Mathematics, Rucker Strauss.

07:21:13.368 --> 07:21:16.070
mathematics.

07:21:16.110 --> 07:21:31.640
So I think the best way if it's okay I'll start is that I'm to to share what's going on collaboratively between the Department of Education, the State Board, and SESSA and coordinated by Rafa Mercado and Brett Mallicott and our team in

07:21:32.481 --> 07:21:37.245
And I'm just coordinating all the work around standards implementation and continuing the works.

07:21:37.305 --> 07:21:41.369
I think that really shares the broad look at we have a lot more work to do.

07:21:41.450 --> 07:21:45.253
So if it's okay I'll be the one that kind of shares that and you can add.

07:21:46.214 --> 07:21:48.877
There's been collaborative groups going working together.

07:21:48.897 --> 07:21:52.781
The math collaboration committees met I believe four times and so science.

07:21:53.101 --> 07:21:55.824
They've set goals to build communities of practice.

07:21:56.885 --> 07:21:59.948
And we've had history meet and now ELA, ELD.

07:22:00.028 --> 07:22:09.840
And so there's a coordinated effort to bring and to roll out capacity building in the counties and in teams so that we can continue the work.

07:22:10.320 --> 07:22:15.406
And in addition, there's a structure of a standard steering committee that meets about every other month.

07:22:16.227 --> 07:22:19.710
that is trying to coordinate all the pieces in the state level.

07:22:19.790 --> 07:22:28.820
So just to assure people that we realize that we have lots more work to do in implementing once we write the framework and adopt it and adopt materials, that's just the beginning.

07:22:29.240 --> 07:22:34.946
And so with coordination, there's a grant, 1.6 million, I think, from Bechtel.

07:22:36.608 --> 07:22:37.369
Did I get that right?

07:22:38.029 --> 07:22:43.472
For science and math and they're looking for funding for the other areas to continue to build the communities of practice.

07:22:43.572 --> 07:22:44.753
I think it's really exciting.

07:22:45.373 --> 07:22:51.617
And in those meetings, it's just so stimulating and exciting thinking about what people are doing out in districts and in counties.

07:22:51.677 --> 07:22:59.642
So that's sort of a general overview of what's happening with the standards implementation, math, science, history, and now ELA, ELD.

07:23:03.284 --> 07:23:04.385
Let me add to that.

07:23:04.705 --> 07:23:18.295
From the beginning, there was some work that was undertaken by Stanford University in a collaborative effort with the California Teachers Association and some assistance now that has come from the Department of Education staff.

07:23:18.715 --> 07:23:33.345
to create an instructional leadership core and the idea behind this was to identify a collection of expert teachers to provide professional development support directly at the LEA level both in English language arts and mathematics.

07:23:33.385 --> 07:23:39.990
That program has grown in scope and aspect to at this point there is some work being done now with the collaborative

07:23:40.370 --> 07:23:55.963
to look at ways to create professional development opportunities using this instructional leadership core, particularly in math and English language arts and science, to provide additional types of professional development collaboration with work that's being done by the collaborative.

07:23:56.443 --> 07:24:07.089
The program is being funded by a grant that's being overseen by the Kress Center at Stanford and collaboratively with work that has been done with the association.

07:24:07.129 --> 07:24:18.114
The department staff has worked very closely with the association and Stanford, both for professional development to develop the craft for these folks as trainers, but also with the summer institutes.

07:24:18.174 --> 07:24:22.817
And the goal has been to create multiple professional learning opportunities

07:24:23.197 --> 07:24:30.923
for implementing the Common Core and using the curriculum in appropriate ways and grow the expertise of classroom teachers over time.

07:24:30.963 --> 07:24:37.028
So that work has continued and they're looking for ways now to expand that work going forward.

07:24:39.406 --> 07:24:47.432
One other thing is that Common Core stakeholders meet several times a year, which is a group of instructional leaders and advocates looking at the best practices.

07:24:47.532 --> 07:24:52.496
So the WestEd research, some of the best practices of districts and counties to help inform.

07:24:52.536 --> 07:24:56.679
And there's another meeting coming up the first week of October that'll be here.

07:24:56.699 --> 07:24:58.301
I think it's at CTA as well.

07:24:58.641 --> 07:25:02.084
And so that's a way to help inform our continued rollout.

07:25:02.224 --> 07:25:03.645
So I hadn't shared that as well.

07:25:04.204 --> 07:25:12.146
And finally, IQC does have a meeting coming up the 22nd and 23rd of this month and in November on the 17th and 18th, I think that's the date.

07:25:12.847 --> 07:25:17.468
Okay, IQC, ELA, ELD, Strauss.

07:25:19.809 --> 07:25:20.689
Okay, you covered that.

07:25:21.389 --> 07:25:24.530
Okay, IQC History, Social Science, Sandoval.

07:25:27.858 --> 07:25:41.301
All right, well, the application process for review panelists to participate in the 2017 History of Social Science Adoption of Instructional Materials is open until Wednesday, October 19th.

07:25:42.101 --> 07:25:55.804
And the responsibilities of the panelists include evaluating instructional materials for use in kindergarten through grade eight that are aligned with the standards for History of Social Science content.

07:25:56.324 --> 07:25:57.225
in our public schools.

07:25:57.686 --> 07:26:13.304
And each panel will consist of multiple instructional materials reviewers, and according to the regulations, the majority must be teachers, and at least one shall have experience instructing English learners, and at least one shall have experience instructing students with disabilities.

07:26:14.205 --> 07:26:19.367
Other reviewers may be administrators, parents, local school board members, and members of the public.

07:26:20.047 --> 07:26:24.408
At least one content review expert will serve on the panel and is required to hold a Ph.D.

07:26:24.428 --> 07:26:26.389
in history or related discipline.

07:26:26.649 --> 07:26:28.609
Stay tuned for more developments there.

07:26:39.173 --> 07:26:41.875
Okay.

07:26:42.536 --> 07:26:57.927
We're having a meeting a little bit later in September, September 20th, where the IQC will be finishing going over the comments from the last second and final public review of the NGSS curriculum framework.

07:26:58.788 --> 07:27:02.170
And I will be on a phone call to hear that.

07:27:02.230 --> 07:27:06.354
I'm not quite sure how they're going to assign the rest of the liaisons on that.

07:27:07.374 --> 07:27:32.101
But that will be the end then of NGSS related to standards curriculum framework and it but the work on the NGSS assessment of course is a different division and Pulling it into the accountability system won't will is years off a couple years off And so it'll shift over to a different set of players at that point Computer science Williams

07:27:33.812 --> 07:27:38.718
Okay, first of all, I want to say that I'm really happy that I had no travel in August for the State Board.

07:27:39.479 --> 07:27:40.380
Absolutely none.

07:27:40.620 --> 07:27:51.333
So I worked on a lot of personal projects, started a genealogy chart, you know, just said, okay, I'm going to focus on the pool and my own personal projects.

07:27:51.994 --> 07:27:57.899
That said, I spent a lot of time in e-mails and phone calls and texts and things like that, including on computer science.

07:27:59.080 --> 07:28:02.643
I know we haven't taken computer science up as a full board yet.

07:28:02.743 --> 07:28:03.764
Believe me, I know that.

07:28:03.844 --> 07:28:04.965
I ask at every meeting.

07:28:05.385 --> 07:28:13.292
But as you can tell, the accountability stuff, which is a bigger issue and a more important issue and much more complex, has rightfully taken up our time.

07:28:13.852 --> 07:28:19.138
I'm hoping we'll be able to do that in early 2017, have a presentation board discussion.

07:28:19.779 --> 07:28:29.029
In the meantime, I have had President Kirst's authorization to help support any LEAs that would like to know more about computer science education and

07:28:29.589 --> 07:28:31.650
and to start taking it up.

07:28:32.171 --> 07:28:41.557
I think I mentioned to you last time that we had a presentation before the EdTech Committee of the IQC in May, and they were really excited about it.

07:28:42.097 --> 07:28:53.144
I work primarily, although I work with state leaders on this, I work behind the scenes primarily with Code.org, who actually launched this campaign three years ago, and they are a nonprofit organization.

07:28:54.064 --> 07:29:18.630
And I, in October, on October 10th at the CDE STEM Symposium, October 10th, mark your calendars, 3 to 4.15, I organized a presentation with Alice Steinglass, the Vice President of Code.org, who will give a presentation on how the importance of computer science in K-12 and why that momentum is growing, and there will be three

07:29:19.530 --> 07:29:31.559
computer science education leads, one from San Francisco Unified, one from Los Altos Elementary, and one from Granada Hills Public Charter School talking about how they are now bringing it into their schools.

07:29:31.940 --> 07:29:34.662
There will be also information at that meeting about

07:29:35.302 --> 07:29:47.691
for districts or LEAs that want to apply to partner with Code.org this fall, to apply this fall for free professional development and curriculum for the summer of 2017.

07:29:48.291 --> 07:30:01.981
In addition, I have reached out to the California School Boards Association to see if they would like to have any speakers on computer science at their December meeting, but I thought of that too late.

07:30:02.481 --> 07:30:04.002
and they already had everything booked up.

07:30:04.142 --> 07:30:07.763
However, I reached out also to AXA to see if they might be interested.

07:30:08.023 --> 07:30:10.003
There's Alicia sitting at the back of the room.

07:30:11.304 --> 07:30:17.246
I was connected to her by Julie White to see if they might be interested at their superintendent's symposium.

07:30:17.306 --> 07:30:20.627
So she has forwarded that information, the possibilities.

07:30:21.127 --> 07:30:27.649
The actual CEO and founder of Code.org, Hadi Partovi, has offered to come out and be a plenary speaker for them.

07:30:28.189 --> 07:30:48.696
and also to bring others if, depending on their own level of interest, bring others to talk about the new national K-12 CS framework that's going to be released in October and the brand new computer science principles AP course that has been piloted the past two years and now has an AP exam approved by the college board.

07:30:49.076 --> 07:30:52.379
They'll be getting a lot of PR on both of those things this fall.

07:30:52.419 --> 07:30:59.045
So, I'm waiting to hear from Alicia on whether or not their committee is interested in having Hathi and having more information.

07:31:03.249 --> 07:31:06.052
So, Advisory Council on Special Ed.

07:31:09.475 --> 07:31:33.400
The advisory commission on special education met on August 10th and 11th and this group always has a really full schedule and one of the highlights was on August 11th and Michelle center, the director of assessment development and administration division offered an assessment update focusing on the conceptual design for the California alternate assessment for science.

07:31:34.780 --> 07:31:40.923
And the members who were in attendance really expressed a deep appreciation for the work that's happening there.

07:31:41.724 --> 07:31:53.870
And it's, I think, a way to better serve students with disabilities through purposeful collaboration between state board and department staff throughout the various divisions.

07:31:53.910 --> 07:32:03.335
So I think there was a consensus, just that there's a lot of excitement and good energy around the alternate assessment for science.

07:32:04.315 --> 07:32:17.579
And then we also had a representative from San Francisco State University who talked about the vision for implementation of the FAIR Act, specifically as it relates to curriculum that's inclusive of students with disabilities.

07:32:17.679 --> 07:32:19.579
So that was a good discussion.

07:32:20.420 --> 07:32:28.562
And then a representative from the Commission on the Teacher Credentialing addressed their implementation of the task force recommendations.

07:32:29.483 --> 07:32:45.878
and also talked about their use of the disability equity rubric that was part of the work of the Advisory Commission on Special Education as a frame for redesigning the credential structure and preparation requirements in different areas.

07:32:46.518 --> 07:32:52.224
So it's nice to see the task force continuing to be used in significant ways.

07:32:53.405 --> 07:32:53.905
And then,

07:32:55.646 --> 07:33:03.028
Another highlight was the honoring of Camino Nuevo Charter Academy and the Cane Sea Art Campus in L.A.'

07:33:03.008 --> 07:33:04.869
's MacArthur Park neighborhood of L.A.

07:33:05.509 --> 07:33:13.091
Educators at this school are the recipients of this year's Goal Award, and this celebrates innovation and exemplary practices.

07:33:13.611 --> 07:33:22.734
And this school implements a dynamic blended inclusion model, and this ensures that each adult on campus is responsible for the education of every child.

07:33:23.514 --> 07:33:29.817
So, co-teaching happens at this site, and continuous job-embedded learning supports teachers.

07:33:30.758 --> 07:33:35.160
And the school supports students pre-K through 16.

07:33:35.200 --> 07:33:44.845
95% of students qualify for free or reduced lunch, and 76% of students have been designated at one time as an English language learner.

07:33:45.446 --> 07:33:55.566
So, they have a lot to shout about and it was very inspiring to hear from representatives of how that's serving our students.

07:33:56.778 --> 07:34:07.723
And then lastly, the Advisory Commission on Special Education's annual report for the 15-16 year is now out, will be in your boxes any moment.

07:34:08.383 --> 07:34:21.729
And again, this is a very active commission with members who really take their responsibilities seriously, and I'm grateful for the work they do to inform us through this time of rapid change in our education system.

07:34:25.061 --> 07:34:26.882
That brings us to CTC.

07:34:27.522 --> 07:34:33.645
Maybe you could mention what CTC has been doing about special education teachers.

07:34:34.385 --> 07:34:37.167
So actually, CTC is meeting today and tomorrow.

07:34:37.227 --> 07:34:42.089
So normally, it's the opposite month from us, but it just got scheduled on the same day.

07:34:42.149 --> 07:34:43.670
There's lots happening here in Sacramento.

07:34:43.710 --> 07:34:50.413
So actually, on their agenda today, they are revisiting special education and program induction standards.

07:34:50.473 --> 07:34:51.674
That's on the agenda today.

07:34:52.094 --> 07:34:58.857
They are also talking about subject matter programs for elementary authorization and administrative standard service updates.

07:34:58.877 --> 07:35:08.442
So there's a lot of talk in CTC about updating standards to be with our current expectations but unfortunately I'm not in the conversation today since I'm here.

07:35:08.762 --> 07:35:16.325
But they are doing actually an exciting it's another in October in San Diego I think it's on check on the 19th but

07:35:17.646 --> 07:35:23.489
They're doing the, all the deans of the departments of education for all the schools.

07:35:23.589 --> 07:35:25.811
And Tom Tarlix and I were on the panel last year.

07:35:25.851 --> 07:35:26.611
It was really fun.

07:35:27.151 --> 07:35:32.414
But it's the first time I think in 20 years that all the deans of the colleges of education in California were in the same room.

07:35:32.434 --> 07:35:34.596
It was public and private.

07:35:34.736 --> 07:35:44.381
And so actually we've been invited to be on a panel to talk about the relevance and quality of teacher preparation programs, retention issues,

07:35:46.002 --> 07:35:58.922
how we're going to deal with the demands of the teaching force and so we'll have a report I think for the November meeting but it's a really exciting opportunity and it's CTC plays an important role in coordinating that meeting that's coming up.

07:36:00.896 --> 07:36:06.059
Okay, California Collaborative on Educational Excellence, Board Member Burr.

07:36:07.740 --> 07:36:20.888
Well, I'll start by saying I'm sure that Dr. Carl Cohn and his staff breathed a huge sigh of relief with our vote this morning because they were waiting for the evaluation rubrics to be adopted in order to start their training.

07:36:21.829 --> 07:36:28.393
So just by way of background, I think I shared before, but the budget this year provided $24 million to the collaborative

07:36:29.133 --> 07:36:47.421
of which up to $20 million is available for statewide professional development on the evaluation rubrics and the revised LCAP template, and up to $4 million for pilot projects for the CCEE to do a trial run on what kinds of services they're going to be providing to LEAs.

07:36:48.561 --> 07:37:01.650
So if you look on the CCE website, which I would encourage you all to do, they now have information about nine workshops, I think Nancy mentioned this briefly in her presentation, that will run between November 2nd and November 18th.

07:37:02.491 --> 07:37:05.473
Online registration will be available by tomorrow.

07:37:06.314 --> 07:37:15.160
And they're all throughout the state, and that's the first sort of broad brush conversation about what the rubrics look like and what the LCAP template will look like.

07:37:15.760 --> 07:37:19.241
These are mostly county people that are in this first round or not?

07:37:20.102 --> 07:37:21.382
It's y'all come.

07:37:22.003 --> 07:37:22.743
Everybody come.

07:37:22.823 --> 07:37:25.944
Anybody who wants to learn about it is in this first round.

07:37:26.364 --> 07:37:35.448
There's also a parallel process going on for what's called an early adopter network, and these are intended to be professional learning communities.

07:37:35.888 --> 07:37:37.470
that will be more enduring.

07:37:38.171 --> 07:37:43.097
Some are already underway, and so this is a way to give them some additional funding.

07:37:43.777 --> 07:37:53.629
The contract with those early adopter networks will be finalized by September 19, and all of those will come to our next CCEE board meeting, October 6.

07:37:56.312 --> 07:38:01.937
We also discussed the draft of the professional development plan at our August meeting.

07:38:02.758 --> 07:38:12.187
That draft will be posted with revisions by September 16th on the CCEE website, along with the survey seeking feedback.

07:38:12.207 --> 07:38:19.814
So people who are interested in providing additional input into what the next phase of professional development looks like, I'd encourage you to take a look at that.

07:38:20.414 --> 07:38:30.096
And then again, the final version of the professional development plan will be brought to the collaborative board on October 6th, so stay tuned.

07:38:30.476 --> 07:38:33.737
The CCE is very much geared up right now.

07:38:33.757 --> 07:38:43.899
I just want to mention that I think I said at our last meeting, Sandy Thorstenson, who was our chair and was the superintendent of Whittier High School District, retired.

07:38:44.759 --> 07:38:46.739
The governor has appointed Matt Navo.

07:38:46.859 --> 07:38:47.820
Many of you know Matt.

07:38:47.880 --> 07:38:49.580
He's a superintendent in Sanger.

07:38:50.460 --> 07:38:54.321
to replace Sandy, so Matt will be joining us in October.

07:38:55.121 --> 07:39:11.885
But that means that Matt has to resign from the CPAG, from the California Practitioners Advisory Group, which takes me to my next just reminder that we are now recruiting, President Kirsten mentioned this briefly at the beginning of the meeting, for three advisory committees

07:39:12.885 --> 07:39:20.253
The California Practitioner Advisory Group, we need one member who has to be a superintendent or an other administrator.

07:39:20.754 --> 07:39:24.518
We're recruiting for two members for the Nutrition Advisory Committee.

07:39:25.339 --> 07:39:29.524
We need teachers and or curriculum coordinators for those slots.

07:39:30.044 --> 07:39:33.889
We're recruiting for one slot on the Advisory Commission for Charter Schools.

07:39:34.189 --> 07:39:36.332
That's the county superintendent slot.

07:39:36.772 --> 07:39:42.659
And for each of those three advisory committees, the deadline is October 6th for applications.

07:39:42.739 --> 07:39:45.823
All the information is on our website, on the state board website.

07:39:46.743 --> 07:39:51.064
and although we welcomed Olivia today we are already recruiting for her replacement.

07:39:53.245 --> 07:39:55.746
As you all know the student board member term is short.

07:39:55.786 --> 07:39:59.367
It's only one year so we've initiated that recruitment as well.

07:39:59.527 --> 07:40:13.031
There's information about for students to submit applications and those applications are due in October 10th and then we will be making recommendations to you all in November for appointments to the advisory committees.

07:40:15.316 --> 07:40:18.108
Okay, so that's all I had from that.

07:40:18.771 --> 07:40:19.354
Go ahead.

07:40:22.775 --> 07:40:33.281
I just want to thank Superintendent Torlakson because he will be visiting Long Beach Unified in a couple of weeks and in particular he's going to visit my husband's school in downtown Long Beach.

07:40:33.761 --> 07:40:35.062
So thank you very much.

07:40:35.102 --> 07:40:41.165
I think it's such an honor for that school community to welcome you to so you could see some of the good things that happen in Long Beach.

07:40:41.485 --> 07:40:49.049
Unfortunately you can't attend my kid's school, visit their school but I'm also happy to report that I now have two official kids in the school district

07:40:49.549 --> 07:40:52.250
TK in first grade, yes, because she was in preschool.

07:40:52.270 --> 07:40:53.131
Now she's in TK.

07:40:54.051 --> 07:41:00.374
And I always bring that to mind because I want to make sure that people know I talk the talk, but I walk the walk.

07:41:00.974 --> 07:41:05.296
And I know that every decision I make will have an impact on my own kids' education.

07:41:05.716 --> 07:41:11.959
And so even though they think I just fly and go to meetings, they have no idea what I do, I always tell them, I'm doing it for you.

07:41:12.419 --> 07:41:13.820
And that's exactly what I do here.

07:41:14.060 --> 07:41:14.260
Thanks.

07:41:16.997 --> 07:41:24.644
All right, so we're adjourned for the day and we got through faster than we ever thought.
