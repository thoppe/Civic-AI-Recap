WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Okay. Good morning, Linda.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
We're live. Good morning.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
All right. Good morning, everyone.

00:10.000 --> 00:20.000
We are going to reopen the July 2020 board meeting and Karen, can you take the role? Yes.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Linda Darling-Hammond.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
Here. Cynthia Glover-Woods.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
Here. Jim McQuillen.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Here. Brenna Pangelinan.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Here. Kim Patio-Bronson.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
Here. Ida Rodriguez.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
Here. Eileen Strauss.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
Here. Okay.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
Matt is here. Matt is here. Matt's in. Matt, welcome, Matt.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Here.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
We missed you.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
We're still working the problem for Ting and for Patricia, but hopefully we'll join us shortly.

00:58.000 --> 01:05.000
Right. So we've had some technology problems and a couple of our board members couldn't get in. We have a couple more who will come.

01:05.000 --> 01:12.000
But we are going to begin this morning by reopening item one, which is our state board priorities item.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
And hopefully our other board members will join us before we get to the end of that item.

01:18.000 --> 01:25.000
We're going to take action on the draft May 2020 meeting minutes and report on our liaison assignments.

01:25.000 --> 01:36.000
So there should be a public comment slide that will go up.

01:36.000 --> 01:48.000
Nope. Yes, we're putting that up now.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
There we go.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
So this is on the draft preliminary report of action minutes for the May 7th, 2020 meeting.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
We'll open the phone line for public comment.

02:00.000 --> 02:14.000
Members of the public wishing to provide comment on this item may do so by calling a 712-432-0075 entering the access code and following the instructions on this slide.

02:14.000 --> 02:28.000
And while we are waiting for any members of the public to call in, do I have a motion from a board member to approve the May 7th, 2020 State Board of Education draft preliminary report of action slash meeting minutes?

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
I'll motion.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
I hear member Navo. And is there a second? Second.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Was that, who was that?

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
Thank you very much. I can't see everyone at once. Great.

02:43.000 --> 02:54.000
And are there any public comments?

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
No, we have public comment, but they're for the charter items.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
Okay, so there's no public comments. Is there any further discussion of the board meeting minutes?

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Okay.

03:08.000 --> 03:16.000
Board members, please raise your hand in the participant panel of Zoom. Karen will keep track of the raised hands.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
And I believe our new board members will abstain from voting on this item.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Correct.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Okay.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
And Karen, can you please call the roll?

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Okay, let's see.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
No one's raising their, no one's raising their hand. Did you want them to raise it in the participant list?

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
That's what it says in the script.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
Why don't we just do the roll call? It's easier. Yeah.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.000
Matt. Yes. Thank you, Matt. Okay. Brenna.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
Yes. Kim. Yes.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
Eileen. Yes. And Ting. Has Ting joined us? No.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
Ting should be in. Let's see if she's, Ting, are you there?

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
Hello, Ting. Okay. Hi. I can't see anything or anyone though.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
We can hear you. That's a step in the right direction.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
We can see you.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Do you see us, Ting?

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
I don't. I can't see, and my camera is, well, let's see. Okay.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
There you are. We see you. Okay.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
You look great.

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
Okay. So Ting, we're voting on the minutes.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
Okay.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
I need you to say yes. Yes. Okay.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Thank you.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
But no pressure. No pressure.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
What about Patricia Rucker? Is she with us? Okay.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
And then I need to fix this whole thing. Yes, I am. Okay.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Patricia, we're voting on the minutes.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Oh my gosh.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
Patricia, can you say yes? Yes. Okay, good. All right.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
So the minutes have been approved.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
All right. That was quite an accomplishment.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
We'll see how the rest of the day goes.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
Now I want to invite the state board members to report out on any

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
liaison activities that are not related to any items on our July

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
agenda.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
And because of our three new board members who were just sworn in

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
this morning,

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
they have not yet received liaison assignments,

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
but we'll be working together after the board meeting to discuss the

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
various opportunities they may wish to get involved in.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
So let's begin by calling on other board members based on their last

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
name. I'm going to start with member Navo.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
In the middle.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
There we go. Can you hear me? Yep.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Okay. I think I speak for everyone.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
Ting, that was the most stressed. That took years off my life right there.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
Trying to get on.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
That took years off my life.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
So I got a couple of computers of trying to work this thing and we'll see

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
how we do here.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
So the system of support to say the least has been very busy.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
And just for those in the audience that when I say system of support,

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
I mean, California department of ed,

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
the California collaborative for educational excellence, the state board,

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
the county offices, the LEA, the geographic leads, the scope of leads.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
So it's, it's a composite of many entities across the state that are doing

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
the work of supporting schools.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
I'm going to highlight, there's a lot to share,

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
but I'm going to highlight very quickly a couple of big items.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
But I think are important.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
CD and CCE have just awarded the 21st century California school leadership

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
academy grants.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
I think that's a very important,

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
it's going to be providing training across the state to eight awardees to do

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
that training.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
And those awardees to provide administrative and other school leaders

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
throughout the state training and support is university of California,

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
Berkeley, Los Angeles County office of ed, Sacramento County office of ed,

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Los Angeles education partnership, Chico state, Madera County,

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
superintendent of schools in Sonoma County office of ed.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
They represent seven of the,

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
of the county offices and local entities that are going to be providing this

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
training of providing high quality professional development.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
And I think this is a huge move in the right direction for the system of

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
support training,

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
our leaders and providing supports to up and coming leaders in the state,

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
how best to serve students and meet their needs.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
In addition,

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
CCE and CDE are jointly charged with selecting both the county office of

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
education to administer the new dyslexia initiative by September 1st and a

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
county office of education to serve as a lead expert in literacy within the

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
system of support by December 1st.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
So that I think that's going to be,

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
that's another joint project between the CCE and CDE.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
That is a great example of the system of support working together and

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
providing resources across the state. For the CCE,

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
highlighting the distance learning that's went on.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
CCE has provided technical assistance with regards to distance

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
learning.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
They've done that with a multitude of collaboration between CDE state board

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
and county offices as long as, as well as community organizations.

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
And they've done 318 virtual sessions that were completed with the system of

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
support regarding hybrid learning,

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
distance learning with over 16,000 views to the website and a rating of 4.5

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
or higher on the value of the training.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
So I think that says a lot about the quality of the training and support

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
that's going out across the state. In addition to that,

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
you have the continuity of learning playbook that was highlighted.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
That was, that has 19,000,

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
over 19,000 views and helps the system of support to support students

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
and with their social,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
emotional learning and building capacity of English learners,

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
supporting students with special needs as well as resources about how to

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
return. So I think that that's going to be incredibly helpful and has been

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
incredibly helpful. And last but not least,

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
the system of support has engaged in the community engagement initiative.

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
The community engagement initiative is part of the support that's expanding

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
the professional learning networks.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
And those were awarded to Chino Valley Unified, Marino Valley,

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
Pajaro Valley, Riverside, Upper Lake and Val Verde Unified School District.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
So there's a lot going on in the system of support right now,

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
as it pertains to awarding entities across the state to do the good work.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
And there's also a lot going on around distance learning. How do we,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
how do we return? And the CCE, CDE,

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
County Office of Eds are right back, right in the middle of all that.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
And I think to go into the details of board president,

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
we could talk about an hour about it,

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
but I think that highlights the most high level things that are happening across

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
the state at this point.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
All right. Thank you. Thank you so much and welcome. We're glad you're here.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Glad you got in.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Me too.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
We're going to go to board member Pangalina.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Hi, nothing really.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
I'm just excited to support the next student board member once they join in

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
any way that I can.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Terrific.

10:41.000 --> 10:47.000
We will look forward to your doing that and to your checking back in with us

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
regularly. Member Patil Bronson.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Good morning.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
So there's a couple of things I was going to provide an update on.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
One is the early childhood policy council has had a couple of meetings

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
since we have last been all together.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
And much of the conversation has been around the master plan for early

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
learning and care.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
That is a master plan that is due to,

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
for its public debut on October 1st.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
There is a research team comprised of Wested, Child Trends,

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
Stanford School of Ed, Rand, LIF, AIR, Neiman Collaborative,

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
and social policy partners,

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
all of whom have been working together to both assess the current state of

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
the system of early care and education,

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
and then also to make recommendations for the plan moving forward.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
They've broken it out into a couple of meta categories that they're making

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
recommendations around in finance,

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
in expansion of access around facilities, quality improvement,

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
and universal pre-K.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
Also in this last year's budget that was just recently signed,

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
there's been some movement of programs across various departments.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
And so the four-year-old programs are staying with the Department of

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
Education and the younger child care wraparound programs,

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
and a number of other sort of more health-related programs are going to

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
stay under Health and Human Services with the Department of Social Services.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
But obviously,

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
CDE having state preschool is,

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
I think,

12:43.000 --> 12:48.000
signaling and an opportunity to create more cohesion and sort of alignment

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
and articulation between the early learning and K-12 systems,

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
which is,

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
I think,

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
something for us as a board to continue tracking.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
In addition,

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
I also wanted to report out on the early math symposium,

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
which I was able to attend part of, which was really fantastic.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
And it was both,

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
I think,

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
very much geared towards educators and actually informing classroom

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
practice,

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
but also sort of went between the 30,000-foot level,

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
as well as the sort of individual adult-to-child interaction levels,

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
and very much addressing this idea of how to integrate

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
and make early math skills,

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
applied learning opportunities in the early years,

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
everything from business planning for four-year-olds,

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
for how to host a lemonade stand and bake sale,

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
as well as physical education integration with PE and counting of steps

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
and such,

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
but to essentially make learning active, integrated,

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
and project-based,

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
which obviously is something that many of us are thinking about,

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
not just for the early years,

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
but wanting the math curriculum to be something that lives in children's

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
minds,

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
in their sort of pencil and papers,

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
but also in their activities and how they understand and absorb

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
all of the learning.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
There was also a really clear focus on making sure that children with

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
disabilities would also be brought into this

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
format,

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
and I think maybe the top line where I should have started is that

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
we oftentimes, I think,

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
when focusing on early years and the sort of initial year of testing,

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
focus on third grade reading as the year where the achievement graph is

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
most readily apparent in the beginning,

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
but third grade math scores also show some significant need for improvement

14:54.000 --> 15:00.000
and those are our achievement gaps that once settled as early as age eight

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
are really difficult to get around.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
There's also interesting gender implications where girls tend to do

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
better or as well as boys in the early years,

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
and then there's a flip around fourth and fifth grade,

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
which need not be.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
So in any case,

15:18.000 --> 15:23.000
it was great learning and I heard from a number of participants about how

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
beneficial it was.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Great.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Great.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
And you just taught us a lot.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Thank you very much.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Member Rucker.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Patricia, are you there?

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Can you unmute yourself?

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Yes, can you hear me?

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Yes.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Okay.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
I'm on my phone,

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
so this is going to be a different kind of,

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
this will be an interesting interaction for the whole day.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
And I'm with the board member novel.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
This was, this took a few,

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
this took a few minutes off my life getting in on the call today.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
I want to thank you all.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
First of all,

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
for taking the time to be with us today.

16:08.000 --> 16:13.000
It would be a mistake to imagine that the impacts of our separate and collective

16:13.000 --> 16:18.000
works on this board absent and acknowledgement that something fundamentally

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
has taken place in our world,

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
as well as the controversies and traumas that have interrupted life and

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
schooling for millions of California students and their households.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
So as we talk about all the work that we've done,

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
it's important for us to understand that the opening of school this year is

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
going to be like any other school year in our careers.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
I also,

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
along with member Patil Bronson and board member Strauss,

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
I'm sure you'll hear from her as well,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
participated in the early math symposium.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
I had the honor of giving,

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
giving the opening address to welcome the conference participants.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
And it has always been a wonderful session.

16:56.000 --> 17:01.000
I've had the opportunity and the thrill of supporting this conference from its

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
inception and its beginning conference activities.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
I also, sir, speaking of math,

17:07.000 --> 17:12.000
I also am the liaison for the math curriculum framework committee.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
They had a virtual meeting,

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
a two day video conference on June 24th and 25th.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
The agenda covered new content in chapter four,

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
exploring and discovering and reasoning with and about mathematics,

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
chapter five, data science,

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
and chapter 10 assessment in the 21st century.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
There's a great deal of interest about what California is doing and developing

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
this new content.

17:35.000 --> 17:40.000
The reasoning and discovery chapter gives a new frame and interpretation to the

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
instructional shifts for teaching math.

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
The data science is literally the expression of what's happening in the world.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
And it lets students become the discoverers of knowledge.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
And then finally,

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
the concerns and ideas expressed by the members as they discuss the assessment

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
chapter and state assessment policies will have far reaching impact on the

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
understanding in the field on what it means to build a more holistic system,

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
systemic approach to assessment.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
It was really important at this meeting to hear feedback from stakeholders

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
during the public comment section about the importance of culturally relevant

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
instruction,

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
asset based instruction and assessment opportunities where students can show

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
what they know.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
Clearly what they were asking for is culture is, was plain,

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
culturally relevant contents,

18:29.000 --> 18:34.000
not about watering down the presentation of content or creating artifice in

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
scaffolding lessons for English learners. It's what the stake,

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
it's about the background,

18:39.000 --> 18:44.000
the context and the relevance of the material stakeholders are looking for in

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
the learning experiences,

18:45.000 --> 18:50.000
the play materials and the activities that will be provided to students.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
I'm also looking forward to the significantly disproportionality stakeholder

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
meeting.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
It will be a virtual meeting on July 15th.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
This has been a long standing concern of the state of California.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
We are in compliance and doing our reporting.

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
Providing services to students with exceptional or special needs as required

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
by federal mandate.

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
But in the area of how we make reports or make referrals for special

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
education,

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
there is we are out of compliance because there is a significant over

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
reporting or over referral of students of color,

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
particularly African-American students.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
And so this will stakeholder work group works to address not only what the

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
standards or criteria are,

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
for significant that defined significant disproportionality,

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
but also providing guidance in developing plans to address this over

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
identification at the local level.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
There was an IQC meeting held on May 13th.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
This was in the week right after the May state board meeting.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
As you know, yesterday,

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
the state board took action to adopt two frameworks recommended by the IQC,

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
the world languages framework and the arts framework.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
At the main meeting,

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
the IQC subject matter committees began the work of instruction materials

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
adoption.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
Both the world languages committee and the arts committee looked at the

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
content maps.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
The standards maps and the evaluation criteria.

20:09.000 --> 20:14.000
So as excited as we were to see the framework come to fruition yesterday,

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
their work is laid out in front of them to begin the process of guiding the

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
students.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
And so we are very excited about that.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
And then finally,

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
I had the opportunity to apply for,

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
and I was accepted into a national work group that's being sponsored by the

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
national association of state boards of education.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
They selected 20 state board members from across the country to participate

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
in a whole child policy study work group.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
It's being launched.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
And the first meeting will be first virtual meeting will be just the

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
first virtual meeting.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
There will be one meeting a month through the end of the year.

20:51.000 --> 20:56.000
The purpose of this work group is to provide support in the development of

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
policies and strategies.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
And leadership for the state board to meet the social,

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
emotional behavioral and mental health needs of students and school

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
personnel.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
In the wake of and recovery from COVID-19.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
So I'm looking forward to being able to share with the board.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
I'm excited about that.

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
I'm going to close my report by taking just a moment of personal privilege.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
We all witnessed with great pain and horror.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
The murder of an African-American man named George Floyd.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Every black leader.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
And in fact,

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
every black person I know from the bond James to my own brother has tried to

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
make a difference in the lives of our students.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
And I'm going to close my report by taking just a moment of personal

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
privilege.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
We all witnessed with great pain and horror.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
The murder of an African-American man named George Floyd.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Every black leader.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
And in fact,

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
every black person I know from the bond James to my own brother has tried to

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
give some rationality or explain this cause in this problem.

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
I will use this pulpit to add their words because they said it better than I

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
could.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
To the public record.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
There's this thing called the black tax.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
It's not an IRS thing.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
It's the added burden that comes with being black in America.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
It's routinely paid no matter how much education you have.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
The black tax is more than the added stares,

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
whispers and suspicions when you're out and about.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
It's about the many instances of disrespect and incivility.

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
Your color seems to engender and being expected to somewhat,

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
somehow always restrain yourself.

22:23.000 --> 22:28.000
Lest you not be what white Americans are never asked to be a credit for the

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
race.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
That experience includes not being afforded the same privileges as others,

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
as well as not being treated the same in the eyes of the law.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
It's about living a life that included both of your parents growing up in

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
rural Mississippi and recounting childhood memories of lynchings,

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
the Ku Klux Klan,

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
the four jobs their parents were to send them to private schools in another

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
state.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
It's about the fears that lead to decisions not to let me,

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
their child out of their site or the issues they had to think through and

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
deciding whether or not we could go away to college.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
And then not being surprised when the campus police stopped and frisked my

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
brothers for walking or driving on campus while black.

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
It's the day in and day out fatigue of trying to explain the obvious to the

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
clueless.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
It's about being asked to overlook blue failings and white failures so they

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
can conveniently be viewed as black issues.

23:19.000 --> 23:24.000
It's about being asked by so many what they should do or say about race when

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
the easy answer lies in the privacy of each person's heart.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
It's the black tax.

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
It's paid by me and every person of color on this panel and across the

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
country.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
And frankly, I have been paying that tax long enough that I shouldn't have to

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
ask others to simply accept one basic reality that black lives matter.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
Thank you.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
Thank you very much, Pat.

23:48.000 --> 23:53.000
Vice President Strauss.

23:53.000 --> 23:59.000
Let me just say that these have been incredibly and are incredibly

23:59.000 --> 24:04.000
challenging times for students, for their families, for teachers and

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
leaders.

24:05.000 --> 24:09.000
And everybody I know in the field is working really, really hard and

24:09.000 --> 24:14.000
everyone's tired and trying their best to do for students what students need

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
to be connected.

24:16.000 --> 24:21.000
So the theme and all the liaison work that I did that I've done since the

24:21.000 --> 24:26.000
last board meeting in May really had a whole theme of really connecting to

24:26.000 --> 24:31.000
students, trying to help teachers, trying to build community and a lot of

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
collaboration.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
That's the theme of all of the work.

24:34.000 --> 24:39.000
And I think that this is our opportunity to do things differently and really

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
make it better and not to just tweak it, but to really shake it up.

24:43.000 --> 24:48.000
And so I just want to say that I think that isn't all the liaison work.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
I do liaison to the credentialing commission and as part of that, I'm

24:52.000 --> 24:58.000
invited to attend the CSU California Center for Advancement of Instruction and

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Quantitative Reasoning.

24:59.000 --> 25:04.000
And while Member Rucker is the liaison for the math framework, the work that

25:04.000 --> 25:11.000
CSU is doing with K-12 school districts is to try to help students in their math

25:11.000 --> 25:16.000
pathways and try to get students to be successful in a fourth year of math.

25:16.000 --> 25:21.000
And so they convened on Friday, May 8th, right after our board meeting.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
And they highlighted some of the projects that are going on in the state that I

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
think will be really helpful and could be included in some of the strategies in

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
the new math framework.

25:31.000 --> 25:36.000
But there's some exciting ways they're rethinking the fourth year of math for

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
students in high school in quantitative reasonings.

25:40.000 --> 25:45.000
They're also looking at new courses that would help students who struggle with

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
Algebra 2, which is really a challenging course for many students or what we

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
call integrated math 3, depending on which district you're in.

25:52.000 --> 25:58.000
And so the collaboration from CSU campuses and school districts, they're also

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
looking at ways to help teachers get supplemental authorization in computer

26:03.000 --> 26:08.000
science, which we really need, especially as we've adopted our computer science

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
standards.

26:09.000 --> 26:14.000
So I think that their resources will be really helpful and I've asked them to

26:14.000 --> 26:20.000
make sure they connect with CDE and the IQC as far as the framework work.

26:20.000 --> 26:26.000
Also, the core school districts, which are Fresno, Garden Grove, LA Unified,

26:29.000 --> 26:34.000
Long Beach, Oakland, Sacramento City, San Francisco, and Santa Ana, those districts

26:34.000 --> 26:39.000
have been together working on trying to improve school and district practice and

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
their core advisory meets twice a year.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
They were meeting, they met on May 21st.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
They have two things.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
One, they're looking at night freshmen on track program to help students be

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
successful.

26:52.000 --> 26:56.000
Those of us who've worked in high schools realize that you've got to really

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
focus on 9th and 10th graders if you're going to make sure they don't get lost

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
in the process to make sure they complete high school.

27:03.000 --> 27:08.000
So they've been working with a breakthrough success community through

27:08.000 --> 27:13.000
improvement science and they're also looking at back to school analytics,

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
getting students back to school.

27:15.000 --> 27:20.000
So I think the core districts have been very helpful to us in helping to advise

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
some of our work around accountability and improvement of practice.

27:24.000 --> 27:31.000
So I felt that their data tools are available and it was a really collaborative

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
time.

27:32.000 --> 27:37.000
Then the California Collaborative for District Reform, that's a group one

27:37.000 --> 27:42.000
meets three times a year with school districts and researchers.

27:42.000 --> 27:47.000
Many Stanford faculty and they've been working for 15 or 16 years now.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
I think that's part of it as well.

27:50.000 --> 27:55.000
They worked on June 15th and 16th on the issues of reopening schools, which is

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
obviously a real priority for all of us.

27:58.000 --> 28:03.000
They talked about distance learning, social, emotional, and relationship issues

28:03.000 --> 28:08.000
leading through crisis and what the big picture presentation and several

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
districts presented on Long Beach Unified was actually quite impactful in their

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
stakeholder group and what they're sharing.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
And they offer lots of resources and thoughts.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
So I just think everyone is trying to put their best thoughts together.

28:20.000 --> 28:26.000
You might know that we have and sponsored through, I see the Bechtel Foundation

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
that sponsors math and science collaboration in the state, the California

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
Partnership for Science and Mathematics.

28:33.000 --> 28:38.000
The science collaboration meeting group met on June 8th and they're working on

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
professional learning, how to integrate next generation science standards and

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
help to build alignment.

28:43.000 --> 28:48.000
So the CDE has reached out to the science collaboration committee and they are

28:48.000 --> 28:52.000
helping to run some of the remote and webinars that we're offering.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
So our communities of practice around the state of math and science are really

28:56.000 --> 29:02.000
helpful in trying to improve practice in these really challenging times.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
Let's see.

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
Then the special advisory commission, that's not normally a liaison position for

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
me at all, but the position is vacant.

29:10.000 --> 29:15.000
And so I did attend June 17th to make sure that we had state board representation

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
there.

29:16.000 --> 29:21.000
We have a new chair and a new vice chair, David Thompson and Havanya Hayes-White

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
are selected as our chair and our vice chair.

29:24.000 --> 29:30.000
They had updates on state assessment, the annual report for special ed.

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
The special ed division did an update on what's happening during the coronavirus

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
pandemic.

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
And really a shout out to Marin County Office of Education.

29:39.000 --> 29:45.000
They brought students back and they presented how they're dealing with on-site

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
instruction during the pandemic.

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
They really collaborated with community agencies.

29:51.000 --> 29:56.000
They just been doing really quite, sharing the successes and lessons learned.

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
They also, at the special advisory commission, talked about the parent and family

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
perspective on distance learning and what that's meant.

30:03.000 --> 30:08.000
And then a very, very heartfelt thank you to Kristen Wright for all of her

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
service as the state director of special ed.

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
When I first met Kristen almost 10 years ago, she was on the advisory commission

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
of special ed.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
So she really has served us well.

30:18.000 --> 30:22.000
And as you know, she's moved on to Sacramento County Office, so not too far away

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
and still a resource for us in special ed.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Two more.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
The credentialing commission met on June 18th and 19th.

30:30.000 --> 30:35.000
And Ida, you actually probably, Ida was sitting there because she's a commissioner.

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
But basically there's a lot of updates that credentialing commission has tried to

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
do in light of the pandemic to make sure that teachers can teach in the fall if

30:43.000 --> 30:47.000
they didn't finish their hours because the school was closed or if they couldn't

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
take their test that was required because the testing center was closed.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
So along with what the credentialing commission could do and along with what

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
governor Newsom would do with executive orders, they did everything they could

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
so that we would have teachers available to teach in the fall for where our

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
needs are.

31:03.000 --> 31:08.000
And the credential commission is also looking at their accreditation system.

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
They have four years of implementation of the current system and they believe

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
that there's some changes and edits that need to be made.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
So we'll probably be hearing more about that.

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
And then they're also looking at the teacher performance assessment and

31:21.000 --> 31:26.000
comparability study between all the different assessments for youth to assess

31:26.000 --> 31:31.000
teacher performance, TPEs, Cal, TPA, Ed, TPA, and FASTA best.

31:31.000 --> 31:37.000
So there's lots of them and Ida might want to add any more context to this.

31:37.000 --> 31:42.000
They also, we have a bilingual authorization workgroup that began in late May to

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
analyze and look at program standards.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
So that's a really important issue as we continue to implement more and more

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
dual language programs.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
And then a lot of discussion of teacher preparation programs and then handing

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
off to induction programs and how to support mentors with new teachers.

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
And there's continuing work on child development permit, which I'm sure you're

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
probably aware of as well.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
So you might want to add to that.

32:06.000 --> 32:11.000
I'll just add just to support, the early math symposium was amazing.

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
I don't know if I did my job describing it, but I believe there were over 5,000

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
attendees because it was remote and it was free.

32:19.000 --> 32:24.000
We had people from all over the country and a credit to Carolyn Fister from

32:24.000 --> 32:30.000
State Board and Fresno County office for an amazing remote conference with

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
full sessions, breakout rooms.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
It was amazing.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
And those resources are available.

32:35.000 --> 32:39.000
But I just was so proud of the opportunity that was provided.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
And then this is my last one.

32:40.000 --> 32:44.000
The concurrence commission is the commission that is the subject matter

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
projects.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
The subject matter projects have been very important to us in California in

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
providing teacher professional development.

32:50.000 --> 32:54.000
And many of the heads of the subject matter projects actually are the

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
writers on our frameworks.

32:56.000 --> 33:00.000
Like the arts writers that we have for the arts framework that we adopted

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
yesterday.

33:01.000 --> 33:06.000
So we had our update remotely on what the subject matter projects are doing

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
and what they've been doing during the pandemic.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
And they are going to be a great resource for us going forward with I think

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
President Graham and Hammond can share.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
But just some highlights.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
They're talking about subject matter projects are based at different

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
universities.

33:19.000 --> 33:23.000
But because things are remote, they're actually able to reach teachers in

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
remote areas that didn't have access to some of the training before.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
And so that's been an actual plus.

33:29.000 --> 33:34.000
And so they've also done things like lunch groups an hour once a week at

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
lunchtime.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
They've been doing remote trainings.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
They've been doing conferences.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
And so I think they're going to really help us a lot in our professional

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
development going forward.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
And there are book talks.

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
And they have some new budget to address some of the learning loss,

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
which I'll let President Garlingham and share.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
So that does end my liaison report.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
Thank you.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Thank you very much.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
Member Sun.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
Thank you.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
All right.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
Always a pleasure to follow.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Member Stroud here.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
All right.

34:11.000 --> 34:15.000
So the only item I really want to report on is the,

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
the career technical education.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
I'm a liaison to that.

34:19.000 --> 34:23.000
And the California workforce pathways,

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
advisory joint advisory committee is meeting tomorrow.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
So we always have meet for another day after the board meetings.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
We are in,

34:32.000 --> 34:36.000
we do need an additional state board of education

34:36.000 --> 34:41.000
representative to take the place that a member,

34:41.000 --> 34:45.000
Felisa Ortiz-Lacon had occupied.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
So we, now that we have some new board members,

34:48.000 --> 34:53.000
we may hopefully have someone to replace her very soon.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
So we are meeting tomorrow.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
As this board knows,

34:57.000 --> 35:02.000
we had approved the Perkins five federal applications.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
And in May,

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
and that has gone through its rounds and gone through the governor's

35:07.000 --> 35:12.000
office and has been submitted to the education department in

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
Washington. And they have, from what I've heard,

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
they have provided some feedback.

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
And so there's a little bit of an iterative process going on right

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
now.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
In the meantime,

35:26.000 --> 35:31.000
we are working on the local application for the federal for the

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
Perkins.

35:32.000 --> 35:36.000
Now that we have the Perkins application done,

35:36.000 --> 35:40.000
what the committee will now be focusing on is a couple of things.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
One,

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
streamlining the different funding sources we have for career,

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
technical education.

35:47.000 --> 35:51.000
And we have the CTIG grant.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
As some of you are aware of,

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
we also have are working with our community,

35:56.000 --> 36:00.000
California community college partners on the K-12

36:01.000 --> 36:05.000
grant for, for schools as well.

36:05.000 --> 36:09.000
And we also have now this Perkins grant.

36:09.000 --> 36:13.000
So we're hoping to look at different funding sources and streamline this

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
for LEAs.

36:14.000 --> 36:19.000
The other piece is aligning the different applications and grants

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
towards our guiding principles.

36:23.000 --> 36:27.000
We have developed the guiding principles to support student centered K-14

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
plus pathways.

36:30.000 --> 36:35.000
And that is going to be our foundation from which to look at applications,

36:37.000 --> 36:41.000
look at quality programs and,

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
and actually also collecting data as along those elements and,

36:47.000 --> 36:52.000
and whether our programs are making progress with student achievement along

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
those elements.

36:53.000 --> 36:57.000
So that's essentially moving forward.

36:57.000 --> 37:02.000
And we are also looking at developing more of a California plan for career

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
pathways.

37:04.000 --> 37:09.000
So the Perkins application was only a federal grant application.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
In that process,

37:12.000 --> 37:17.000
a lot of additional issues and topics we need to continue to explore has come

37:20.000 --> 37:25.000
up. And so one of which is credentialing around CTE teachers and educators.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
So we'll continue working on those issues as well.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
So much going on. I'll just add,

37:38.000 --> 37:43.000
I'll add a brief couple of additions to all of that amazing reporting.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
As you might imagine,

37:46.000 --> 37:51.000
it's been very busy over the last few months legislatively as we finally got to

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
a negotiated budget.

37:53.000 --> 37:57.000
And a lot of questions come to the state board staff during that time.

37:57.000 --> 38:01.000
I just want to give a special shout out to Judy Sias and Deborah Brown and

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
Karen Staff Walters for all of the

38:04.000 --> 38:09.000
ball catching that they did and contributions that they made to their

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
process.

38:10.000 --> 38:15.000
We together were involved with sort of helping the various offices figure out

38:19.000 --> 38:24.000
how we could get from here to there in terms of the kinds of strategies that

38:25.000 --> 38:29.000
will support the schools in this very complicated time.

38:29.000 --> 38:34.000
I gave testimony before the assembly on learning loss.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
And as you saw in the budget,

38:37.000 --> 38:42.000
there's quite a bit of legislative language about how we heard about that

38:44.000 --> 38:49.000
over the last day or so about how districts are expected to think about a

38:52.000 --> 38:57.000
continuity plan, how to put in place formative assessments.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
We now have some guidance on that to figure out what kind of learning

39:00.000 --> 39:05.000
strategies are needed and then have to support more accelerated.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
I'm going to get rid of the thank you.

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
There's little things popping up on the screen.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
More accelerated learning.

39:14.000 --> 39:18.000
I think it's really important as we think about the questions and the fears

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
that people have about learning loss to remember a few things.

39:21.000 --> 39:25.000
One is that kids are always learning every minute of every day as we are as

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
adults.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
And so the question is how do we organize what they're learning in a way

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
that will move them forward in the curriculum.

39:32.000 --> 39:37.000
But there's clearly huge inequalities that emerged during this time because

39:38.000 --> 39:43.000
some kids were in context where there was just a great deal more ready support

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
than was available for other kids.

39:46.000 --> 39:51.000
And it will be very important to pick up the phrase that member Rucker used

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
around asset based instruction,

39:53.000 --> 39:57.000
which is one of the ways that our math frameworks folks are thinking about it

39:57.000 --> 40:02.000
that we go into the school year with asset based instruction in mind rather

40:02.000 --> 40:07.000
than identifying deficits and labeling kids as below and behind and sticking

40:07.000 --> 40:11.000
them off into remedial courses where they do drill and kill, you know,

40:11.000 --> 40:15.000
around, you know, getting ready for test scores in the spring.

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
We really need to figure out where they are in their, you know,

40:20.000 --> 40:25.000
along the learning progressions in reading and writing and mathematics and

40:25.000 --> 40:29.000
quantitative reasoning and so on, using good formative assessments,

40:29.000 --> 40:33.000
activating the learning resources that are available to them,

40:33.000 --> 40:37.000
helping them see what they can do, what their strengths are,

40:37.000 --> 40:42.000
using those strengths to move them with accelerated progress.

40:42.000 --> 40:47.000
We will get much, much further that way than we will if we go into the school

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
year with a deficit orientation about the kids.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
So we've been working hard on trying to put the tools together and the

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
framework together that help people think about coming back to school,

40:58.000 --> 41:04.000
welcoming students, also piggybacking on member Rucker's comment about the

41:04.000 --> 41:08.000
National Association of State Boards of Education social emotional learning

41:08.000 --> 41:13.000
workgroup, which I'm working with NASB on.

41:14.000 --> 41:18.000
The social emotional elements of this are going to be very, very important.

41:18.000 --> 41:23.000
So that's been a very big theme in the work that the department's been doing.

41:23.000 --> 41:30.000
The CCE and the state board is figuring out how to provide the tools or

41:30.000 --> 41:34.000
resources for that way of coming back to school.

41:34.000 --> 41:39.000
I hope everyone will spend the first couple of weeks really welcoming kids

41:39.000 --> 41:45.000
and helping them create a community, whether it's online or in person,

41:45.000 --> 41:50.000
enabling them to share what their experiences have been in private ways,

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
as well as in, you know, communitarian ways,

41:54.000 --> 41:59.000
and then figuring out how to help each of them move forward.

41:59.000 --> 42:04.000
And I finally would like to just close by also thanking member Rucker for

42:04.000 --> 42:10.000
calling us in to the conversation about what's been happening in the civil

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
rights arena.

42:13.000 --> 42:20.000
George Floyd was not the only African American man murdered by police just in

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
that little window of time.

42:23.000 --> 42:28.000
Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, Rayshard Brooks, we could go on with the naming.

42:28.000 --> 42:34.000
The broader equity issues have been focusing particularly on issues of

42:34.000 --> 42:39.000
policing, and we've had a lot of conversation about policing in schools.

42:39.000 --> 42:44.000
But we do also have to take up the ways in which systemic racism has led to

42:44.000 --> 42:50.000
tracking in schools, a lack of qualified teachers in the schools serving

42:50.000 --> 42:55.000
students of color, which, by the way, about four times as many

42:55.000 --> 43:00.000
uncredential teachers are in schools serving predominantly students of

43:00.000 --> 43:04.000
color, the weaker curriculum that's often available.

43:04.000 --> 43:08.000
So those are on our plate as members of the state board.

43:08.000 --> 43:14.000
And while we think about the issues of policing and of safety and of the

43:14.000 --> 43:19.000
treatment of adults and children in our society, we should also be thinking

43:19.000 --> 43:24.000
about the ways in which we can dismantle the systemic racism that still exists

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
in our systems.

43:26.000 --> 43:33.000
So on that note, I will close out this part of our agenda.

43:33.000 --> 43:39.000
I would like to ask, there's some screen that keeps coming up.

43:39.000 --> 43:45.000
Whoever is inadvertently sharing their screen, try to be alert to that so

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
that we can continue to see each other.

43:49.000 --> 43:53.000
With that, we're going to go into our public hearings.

43:53.000 --> 44:00.000
And we're going to have three public hearings today, items 19, 20, and 21.

44:00.000 --> 44:04.000
Spanish translators are available for these items during the public comment

44:04.000 --> 44:05.000
period.

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
If the comments you would like to make are in Spanish for items 19, 20, and

44:09.000 --> 44:13.000
21, please use the same phone number and access code provided on the

44:13.000 --> 44:17.000
PowerPoint slide and inform the phone operator that you need a Spanish

44:17.000 --> 44:21.000
English translator so that your comments can be translated.

44:21.000 --> 44:26.000
Members of the public wishing to dial in for public comment should view the

44:26.000 --> 44:30.000
live stream of the meeting to know at what time we'll be asking for public

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
comment for each item on the agenda.

44:32.000 --> 44:36.000
A public comment may be provided by dialing the phone number and participant

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
access code and then following each of the prompts.

44:39.000 --> 44:43.000
And then upon dialing in, callers will be added to a caller queue.

44:44.000 --> 44:48.000
The operator will notify callers when it is their turn to provide public

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
comment.

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
We will also ask the public calling in for public comment to please turn

44:53.000 --> 44:57.000
down the speaker volume of their computers if they're following the live

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
feed to avoid an echoing effect.

44:59.000 --> 45:04.000
There is a delay between the live feed, between what we're doing and the

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
live feed and what people receive.

45:06.000 --> 45:11.000
So we're trying to accommodate for that delay also in the way that we get

45:11.000 --> 45:15.000
people into the queue and able to comment.

45:15.000 --> 45:19.000
Public comment will be limited to one minute for each speaker.

45:19.000 --> 45:23.000
For board members, please mute your microphones when you're not speaking and

45:23.000 --> 45:27.000
keep your cameras on at all times except during the scheduled breaks to

45:27.000 --> 45:31.000
ensure that we maintain a quorum throughout today's virtual meeting.

45:31.000 --> 45:36.000
I saw that yesterday when people had to leave for a few minutes, they put that

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
notice in the chat box.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Thank you for doing that.

45:40.000 --> 45:44.000
I think that's a good practice to continue if you need to excuse yourself

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
for a couple of minutes from the meeting.

45:46.000 --> 45:50.000
For each item on the agenda, there will be an opportunity for you to raise

45:50.000 --> 45:54.000
your hand using the Zoom participant window if you'd like to ask a question

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
or make a comment.

45:55.000 --> 45:59.000
I think pretty much everybody figured that out yesterday, so congratulations

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
to you.

46:00.000 --> 46:05.000
We'll continue to build on our success and take an assets-based approach to

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
our board meeting this morning.

46:08.000 --> 46:14.000
Item 19 is a public hearing regarding the petition for the establishment of

46:14.000 --> 46:18.000
a charter school under the oversight of the State Board of Education, the

46:18.000 --> 46:23.000
PIME Community School, which was denied by the Montebello Unified School

46:23.000 --> 46:27.000
District and the Los Angeles County Office of Education.

46:27.000 --> 46:31.000
The CDE recommends that the State Board hold a public hearing to deny the

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Time Community School petition.

46:33.000 --> 46:37.000
This item will be presented by Stephanie Farland of the CDE.

46:37.000 --> 46:40.000
Stephanie, please begin.

46:40.000 --> 46:44.000
We don't see you yet, but I'm hoping you're there.

46:44.000 --> 46:50.000
So, Linda, they're changing over here, so you need to give us a minute.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
Okay.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
This is a day for technology.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
Apparently so.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
It is a technology day.

46:56.000 --> 47:01.000
So we will take a few minutes.

47:01.000 --> 47:06.000
Why don't we take a five-minute break and let people get their coffee or

47:06.000 --> 47:11.000
whatever, and we'll come back at around 950 and hope that everything is ready

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
to roll.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
Great.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
Thank you.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
Okay.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
But I announced the break, so we'll take the break.

47:17.000 --> 47:20.000
Get your coffee.

47:20.000 --> 47:24.000
Finally ready for takeoff.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
Okay.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
Okay.

47:26.000 --> 47:32.000
So, good morning, President Darling-Hammond, board members, Chief Deputy

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Gregson.

47:34.000 --> 47:40.000
Today we are, right now we are going through item nine, which is a petition

47:40.000 --> 47:45.000
for the establishment of Time Community School.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Stephanie, you meant item 19, correct?

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
I'm sorry, did I say nine?

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
I'm sorry.

47:49.000 --> 47:52.000
Item number 19.

47:52.000 --> 47:56.000
Time Community School, with Time as an acronym, Teamwork Individualization,

47:56.000 --> 48:00.000
Mastery and Extension Community School, is seeking authorization from the

48:00.000 --> 48:04.000
State Board to establish a grade nine through grade 12 charter school within

48:04.000 --> 48:09.000
the boundaries of the Montebello Unified School District.

48:09.000 --> 48:14.000
The petitioners previously saw authorization through Montebello and LA

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
County Board of Education.

48:16.000 --> 48:21.000
They were denied by Montebello Unified on October 23, 2019.

48:21.000 --> 48:25.000
They went on to Los Angeles County Board of Education where they were denied

48:25.000 --> 48:31.000
on January 14, 2020, and they appealed to the State Board on March 6, 2020.

48:31.000 --> 48:35.000
The CDE recommends that the State Board hold a public hearing to deny the

48:35.000 --> 48:39.000
request to establish TCS, a grade nine through grade 12 charter school,

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
under the oversight of SBE.

48:42.000 --> 48:47.000
The time petition was considered at the June 9, 2020 Advisory Commission on

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
Charter Schools.

48:48.000 --> 48:53.000
The ACCS moved to approve the TCS petition with a delay in opening for one

48:53.000 --> 48:58.000
year and with the understanding that TCS would be in operation for four years.

48:58.000 --> 49:05.000
They moved that vote on a vote of seven to two.

49:05.000 --> 49:10.000
The department's basis for recommendation of denial is that the petitioner is

49:10.000 --> 49:14.000
demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the intended program,

49:14.000 --> 49:18.000
and the petition does not provide reasonably comprehensive descriptions of

49:18.000 --> 49:22.000
all required 15 charter elements.

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
A little background on this school, their mission is to develop pupils'

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
academic, social, and political skill sets necessary for lifelong learning,

49:29.000 --> 49:33.000
critical thinking, and positive contributions to the community in which

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
they live.

49:34.000 --> 49:42.000
They intend to open in 2021, 2020 to 2021, that always messes me up a little,

49:42.000 --> 49:48.000
with 110 pupils in grade nine and grow to serve 600 pupils in grades nine through

49:48.000 --> 49:52.000
12 by 2024-25.

49:52.000 --> 49:59.000
It is a college preparatory program.

49:59.000 --> 50:04.000
So the findings from the California Department of Ed.

50:04.000 --> 50:10.000
I would like to, you'll see this similar slide in all of our appeals, as we

50:10.000 --> 50:14.000
mentioned yesterday, because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the

50:14.000 --> 50:19.000
variations in the governor's proposed January budget, the proposed May revision,

50:19.000 --> 50:26.000
and what we finally got in the actual budget that he signed in this month.

50:26.000 --> 50:32.000
So I just want to reiterate, sort of after yesterday's conversation, I want to

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
review how we analyze budgets in the charter schools division.

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
Petitioners send in their budgets with their appeal.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
We take their budget numbers and their projections and we do our own analysis

50:41.000 --> 50:46.000
of it to determine if a school will be fiscally viable and remain so.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
This is what you see in the items.

50:48.000 --> 50:54.000
So we do take their numbers, we do our own analysis, and what you see in our item

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
is our analysis of that.

50:56.000 --> 51:00.000
You can see their own budget numbers through the petition that they submitted

51:00.000 --> 51:06.000
and any other materials that they submit up to the meeting day.

51:06.000 --> 51:11.000
We are consistent with how we review budgets and fiscal projections to ensure

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
we are being fair.

51:13.000 --> 51:17.000
It is understandably confusing right now because of everything going on and its

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
effect on our state budget.

51:19.000 --> 51:24.000
So just as a little background so we're not confused when we have conversations

51:24.000 --> 51:31.000
and when charters are having their time, their 10-minute time, we did ask all of

51:31.000 --> 51:35.000
the schools for a new budget after the May revise was released.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
This was before the ACCS meeting.

51:37.000 --> 51:41.000
We did an analysis of that budget.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
We did an analysis of the May revise budget.

51:43.000 --> 51:48.000
You don't see that in the state board items because the May revise projected

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
budget no longer exists and it's not what we ended up with with the state budget

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
that was signed.

51:53.000 --> 51:58.000
So that is why you don't see that and that's why there was some confusion yesterday.

51:58.000 --> 52:04.000
We did do an analysis of the time budget.

52:04.000 --> 52:10.000
After the May revise and we found that they were fiscally unviable.

52:10.000 --> 52:14.000
Since then, as you know, the state budget has been approved without the immediate

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
budget cuts but with deferrals.

52:16.000 --> 52:20.000
We went back to the original budget time submitted as we did for all of the charter

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
appeals before you yesterday and today.

52:22.000 --> 52:27.000
We went back to their original budget submitted with their appeal petition.

52:27.000 --> 52:30.000
And while, and I'll move on a little bit.

52:30.000 --> 52:38.000
So while they are viable for the first year, not with the reserves that the state

52:38.000 --> 52:44.000
board recommends or requires, but they are viable for the first year and their

52:44.000 --> 52:49.000
viability is predicated on a lot of borrowing and no startup costs.

52:49.000 --> 52:57.000
When we originally reviewed their budget, there was, they had no startup costs

52:57.000 --> 53:02.000
that they projected to have.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
So that was a big issue for us.

53:04.000 --> 53:10.000
To be fiscally solvent, the petitioner needs to rely upon heavy borrowing, which can

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
be exacerbated by the new budget deferrals.

53:13.000 --> 53:17.000
And as I said a minute ago, they do not maintain the appropriate level of reserves

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
for their first year of operation.

53:19.000 --> 53:24.000
So while we understand that many charters start off this way with heavy borrowing,

53:24.000 --> 53:28.000
it seemed irresponsible to recommend for approval with the information we had and

53:28.000 --> 53:35.000
with the knowledge that we don't know where we're going to go in the next year or

53:35.000 --> 53:40.000
two in terms of state budgeting and what districts and charter schools will be

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
receiving from the state budget.

53:43.000 --> 53:47.000
Also, the petition does not provide a reasonably comprehensive description of the

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
following.

53:49.000 --> 53:53.000
Element two, measurable pupil outcomes, 10 suspension and expulsion procedures,

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
and 14 dispute resolution procedures.

53:56.000 --> 54:01.000
With measurable pupil outcomes, they do plan to reside within the Montebello Unified

54:01.000 --> 54:06.000
School District, which is comprised of 25,000 pupils, 85% identify as

54:06.000 --> 54:11.000
socioeconomically disadvantaged, 33% identify as English learners, and 0.8%

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
identify as foster youth.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
The petition does not outline measurable pupil outcomes that address increases in

54:16.000 --> 54:20.000
pupil academic achievement, both school-wide and for all groups of pupils,

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
which is a requirement.

54:22.000 --> 54:25.000
Suspension and expulsion procedures and dispute resolution procedures.

54:25.000 --> 54:29.000
The petition does not include all the necessary language required for each of the

54:29.000 --> 54:34.000
charter elements that we traditionally recommend and require.

54:34.000 --> 54:39.000
So the CDE recommends that the SBE deny the petition to establish time, as they

54:39.000 --> 54:44.000
are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program and they do not

54:44.000 --> 54:49.000
provide reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all required elements.

54:49.000 --> 54:55.000
So in this particular case, which this next bullet is a little different than what

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
we have seen in the past with the State Board of Education.

54:58.000 --> 55:05.000
If the State Board decides after their deliberation to approve the time community

55:05.000 --> 55:10.000
school petition, the Los Angeles County Board of Education has agreed to be its

55:10.000 --> 55:17.000
authorizer under Ed Code section 47605K1, which is the Ed Code section which allows

55:17.000 --> 55:24.000
for the State Board to request that a local agency take over the oversight of a

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
State Board approved school.

55:26.000 --> 55:30.000
In the L.A. County, we did ask the L.A. County Office of Education and they have

55:30.000 --> 55:34.000
agreed to that.

55:34.000 --> 55:38.000
And that is the conclusion.

55:38.000 --> 55:45.000
And I will put up the screen for call in.

55:45.000 --> 55:53.000
Public comment.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Thank you very much, Stephanie.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Okay.

55:57.000 --> 56:04.000
So we are going to now I'm going to open the public hearing at 10 o'clock a.m.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
First we'll hear from the petitioners.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
The petitioners will have 12 minutes.

56:08.000 --> 56:12.000
Then we'll hear from the district and county that are opposing the petition.

56:12.000 --> 56:17.000
They'll also have a total of 12 minutes after the presentation from both sides.

56:17.000 --> 56:21.000
There will be an opportunity for public comment from any individual who is not

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
already presented for one minute each.

56:24.000 --> 56:33.000
So I'll invite the petitioners to come to the podium.

56:33.000 --> 56:37.000
Thank you very much.

56:37.000 --> 56:41.000
And maybe we can take the public comment slide down so they can show whatever

57:03.000 --> 57:06.000
they have to say.

57:06.000 --> 57:09.000
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond, members of the board, Superintendent Thurmond.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
My name is Dr.

57:11.000 --> 57:15.000
Gabriel Ramirez and I am honored to have this opportunity to speak with you about

57:15.000 --> 57:18.000
Time Community Schools, the highly qualified team that created and will lead it,

57:18.000 --> 57:22.000
the students of Montebello who will benefit from the school and the innovative

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
elements of our petition.

57:24.000 --> 57:28.000
Time Community Schools has one fundamental goal, to educate the historically

57:28.000 --> 57:32.000
underserved high school students by providing an innovative model of learning

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
and better social justice.

57:34.000 --> 57:37.000
I'd like to begin by sharing a little bit about my background and that of my

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
board.

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
I am a first-generation Latino college graduate committed to improving my

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
community through education.

57:43.000 --> 57:47.000
I have been in education for 20 years as a nationally board-certified teacher,

57:47.000 --> 57:50.000
an administrator, and a director at the university level.

57:50.000 --> 57:54.000
As a teacher, I delivered culturally relevant and engaging lessons, maintained

57:54.000 --> 57:58.000
high standards for my students that resulted in their ability to perform above

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
school and district averages.

58:00.000 --> 58:03.000
In other words, I decided to develop a charter school designed to address the

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
inequities in education.

58:05.000 --> 58:09.000
For me, my involvement in education is not simply a career choice.

58:09.000 --> 58:14.000
It is my life's work to provide what I believe is a fundamental right to all

58:14.000 --> 58:18.000
children, a quality education that leads them to achieve their dream and life

58:18.000 --> 58:26.000
goals.

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
The TCS board is comprised of highly successful individuals.

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
Every member of the team overcame systems of race, gender, and or income

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
inequality.

58:33.000 --> 58:37.000
We can each personally attest to inequity and justice and lack of access,

58:37.000 --> 58:40.000
resulting in a difficult and challenging road to success.

58:40.000 --> 58:44.000
Fortunately, each member can point to a mentor and or teacher who inspired and

58:44.000 --> 58:48.000
guided them, a gift they intend to pay forward to TCS students.

58:48.000 --> 58:51.000
Each board member individually and collectively is adept at deconstructing

58:51.000 --> 58:54.000
problems and offering thoughtful and practical solutions.

58:54.000 --> 58:58.000
Most importantly, they are able to transfer their undeniable professional

58:58.000 --> 59:01.000
talent and skill to education.

59:01.000 --> 59:05.000
Lamar Brown, TCS board president, is an expert in marketing and community

59:05.000 --> 59:06.000
outreach.

59:06.000 --> 59:10.000
He chose to leave a Fortune 500 company so he could use his skills at the

59:10.000 --> 59:14.000
university to help recruit students of color so they too could benefit from

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
higher education.

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
In addition to his broad oversight as a board member, he will lead the

59:18.000 --> 59:22.000
monitoring and evaluation of our outreach and recruitment initiatives.

59:22.000 --> 59:26.000
As a teacher, administrator, and lawyer, Brandy Price, TCS board vice

59:26.000 --> 59:30.000
president and founding board president, has devoted her life to those who have

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
been marginalized and disenfranchised.

59:32.000 --> 59:35.000
She will bring her vast experience to educational leadership, policy,

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
curriculum, and instruction.

59:37.000 --> 59:41.000
Adrian Enriquez, TCS board treasurer, owns a mortgage company and is a co-owner

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
of United Trust Escrow.

59:42.000 --> 59:46.000
He is committed to developing and supporting TCS to ensure that the school

59:46.000 --> 59:50.000
has the fiscal resources needed to operate its innovative model.

59:50.000 --> 59:54.000
Alexandra Soto, TCS board secretary, is a second generation Montebello business

59:54.000 --> 59:58.000
owner who has been highly engaged in revitalizing the Montebello community

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
with a focus on business and education.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Her status in Montebello will continue to support the development of partners

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
for our student internships.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Lastly, Dr. Jorge Moreno has been practicing integrative medicine for 20

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000
years and is chief medical officer of the Center for Wellness located in

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Montebello.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Dr. Moreno's science background and connections throughout the community

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000
provide leadership that will support our holistic culture of social justice

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000
that will be rooted in educating the mind, body, and spirit.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Clearly, this team is exceptional.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000
We know that our backgrounds and stories will matter to our students and

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000
combined with a high quality education can be used to guide them to achieving

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
their dreams.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000
TCS will prepare students by providing meaningful choices that reflect real

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000
interests and that lead to fulfilling lives.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Our target population resides within the boundaries of Montebello Unified and

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
is 95% Hispanic.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Only 30% of MUSD students graduate meeting University of California A3G

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
requirements.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000
This means that only one in three Montebello district students are even

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000
eligible to apply to a CSU or UC after finishing high school.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Only 44% of MUSD high school students meet ELA standards and only 13% meet the

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000
math standards on CASP.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.000
And to further add context, according to census data, only 10% of adults within

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000
the Montebello community over 25 have earned a bachelor's degree.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000
This means that if TCS is approved, most of our graduates will be the first in

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
their families to go to college.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Our mission is to provide a college preparatory program to students in grades

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000
9 through 12 that will develop the academic, social, and political skill sets

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
necessary for lifelong learning, critical thinking, and positive contribution to

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
the communities in which students live.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Our vision is to positively impact all facets of society.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Research from the past 20 plus years overwhelmingly attests that students need

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.000
an engaging and rigorous curriculum, instruction that is individualized, a

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.000
positive socially just school culture, qualified and caring staff, and a sense

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
of belonging.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
We will use project-based learning because studies repeatedly show its

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
benefits.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Our project-based curriculum is designed to encourage students to become

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000
passionate about learning by taking CTE courses that help prepare them for

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.000
college while exploring career paths, making them both college-ready and

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
career-ready.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000
We will use career-based classes and internships because we know that real

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000
world scenarios not only help students better master content but also fosters

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000
the intrinsic motivation needed to become successful at learning.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.000
In addition, our courses are all UCA through G approved and our graduation

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000
requirements ensure that students are UC CSU eligible at the time of

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
graduation.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Briefly, the time learning model has four components supported by research and

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
best practices.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000
These components are teamwork, individualization, mastery, and

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
extension.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Combined, they support a student's development towards mastery of content and

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
the ability to problem solve.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000
They develop the right habits of mind essential to being successful in any

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000
environment.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Whether a student is gifted, an English learner, or has an IEP, the time

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000
learning model provides for differentiated instruction, maintains rigor,

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000
and individualizes the learning experience.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:21.000
TCS is prepared to provide all students a free and appropriate public education.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.000
On a personal note, my son had an IEP throughout his K-12 education, and so I

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000
have personal experience as a teacher, administrator, and a parent.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000
My son is now 22 years old in college and a success story.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000
As the ED and principal, I am well informed and positioned to provide

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000
appropriate leadership and support to my team to benefit students and to work

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
effectively with families and providers.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.000
TCS is working with the LAC charter to ensure that students are identified and

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.000
served fully and has developed a budget to support a special education teacher

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
slash coordinator and contracted services.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Approximately 95% of our students will be Hispanic and approximately 20% will be

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
English learners.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000
After enrollment, TCS will conduct initial and annual identification and

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000
assessment of primary and second language fluency, provide classroom support,

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000
and employ effective communication strategies with parents slash guardians of

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
ELs.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Lastly, TCS is committed to serving foster and homeless youth and LGBTQ

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000
students through support built into the time learning model, accompanied with

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
thorough and comprehensive training for administrators and teachers in alignment

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000
with the McKinney-Vento Act and AB 490, allowing teachers and students to

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000
develop close interpersonal relationships during which students' individual needs

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000
and challenges can be addressed.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
The environment that we have designed does not allow students to slip through

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000
the cracks because of academic or emotional issues.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Rather, we have created an educational system that ensures that all students are

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000
acknowledged and supported so that they may develop the strength of character to

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
advocate for their own success.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000
At the ACCS Commission meeting, the CDE staff stated they would have recommended

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.000
approval had it not been for the Governor's May revised proposal.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:13.000
In its report to you, the CDE expresses some concern now about pre-opening

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
funding and the effects of deferrals.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
So let me explain our plan that addresses those concerns.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Clearly, we, as does the ACCS, believe that it is ill-advised to open this year at

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000
this late date and with the uncertainties of COVID-19.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000
But had timing permitted, we would have responded to the impact of deferrals and

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:37.000
reopening costs through requesting a deferral exemption, through utilizing charter

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:42.000
school loans and through receivables, which are common practices in the charter

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
world.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.000
If we are approved for opening in 2021, we would use the coming year as a

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.000
development year to pursue startup grants.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.000
The Walton grant invited TCS to apply as a result of a recommendation by Great

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Public Schools Now, which gave us a $50,000 development grant.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Recently, we have submitted the Walton grant application.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Also, we were awarded the PCSGP grant in 2018, but was unable to access due to

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000
district denial.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000
We will apply for the PCSGP grant again during its next cycle.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Lastly, the TCS Board is actively pursuing private grants and currently speaking with

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000
several organizations who are interested in donating academic services and our

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000
funds upon approval.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Our fiscal approach is conservative, and we will maintain this approach to ensure

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
our long-term viability.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000
We approach the budget as we have approached all components of school design with

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000
great intentionality and purpose, consulting with our back office provider and

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
establishing full TCS Board approval.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000
We are thankful that the CDE finds our innovative academic program to be

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:48.000
educationally sound, our budget to be viable and sustainable, and our team to be

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
successful at implementing the program.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Montebello students need TCS.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000
The challenges facing our Hispanic students have impeded them for generations.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Every day that we do not address inequity, another dream is dismissed and

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000
squandered.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.000
The pandemic has highlighted and exacerbated these disparities.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:12.000
This crisis has made it clearer than ever that our students need innovative schools

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:17.000
to help reform and reimagine a system that currently does not serve them well.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:21.000
The ACC has voted seven to two to recommend approval of TCS.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000
We ask today that the SBE vote to approve Time Community Schools.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Thank you.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Thank you very much.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000
We now want to hear from the district and county.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Good morning, I'm representing the county.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
I can go, I can yield to the district to go first.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Go ahead, since you're up.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Okay, let me share up here really quickly.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Okay, am I projecting?

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Yes.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Okay, great.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Good morning, honorable board president, board members, SBE staff and community.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
My name is Darrell Brown and I will be presenting the Los Angeles County Office of Education

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Findings on Time Community School.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000
The county board found that the petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000
implement the proposed educational program.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.000
While the staff report included additional findings, the county board took action based

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:46.000
solely on finding two in the area of finance.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.000
The California Code of Regulations identifies four indicators to determine whether a

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:55.000
petitioner is able to successfully implement instructional design as stated in the charter

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000
petition.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
The Los Angeles County Board based its finding of denial on one of the four

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000
indicators.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:06.000
The county board found that the petitioners presented an unrealistic operational and

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
financial plan for the proposed charter school.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:16.000
During the time of submission, at the time of submission, the school only had $190 in

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
their bank.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000
They also submitted a letter of intent to sell receivables.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.000
However, that letter did not include an annual percentage rate, which impacted our fiscal

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
analysis.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.000
And lastly, the petition calls for a very unique facilities design and at the time of

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:40.000
submission, the petitioner had not yet identified a facility to meet that particular design.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Our fiscal analysis concluded that to be solvent, the budget plan will require the school to

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:52.000
one, secure facility that does not exceed the school's budget, two, to meet its average

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:58.000
daily attendance, which would be 94%, and three, to meet its enrollment projections,

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:06.000
which projected at 110 students in year one and growing to 600 students by year five.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:14.000
In conclusion, the county board found that the petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
successfully implement the proposed educational program.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Thank you.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Thank you.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Any other questions?

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Any other questions?

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Any other questions?

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Any other questions?

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Any other questions?

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Any other questions?

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Any other questions?

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Any other questions?

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Any other questions?

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Any other questions?

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Any other questions?

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Any other questions?

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Any other questions?

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Thank you.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Well, thank you to the State Board of Education and the State Superintendent of Public

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Instruction for giving us some time to share our findings regarding the Time Community

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
School petition.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
My name is Kaven Yun.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.000
I'm the Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services with the Montebello Unified School

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:11.000
District, and we are recommending to the State Board to deny the Time Community School

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
petition.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.000
We evaluated the Time Community School and firmly believes that it fails to meet the

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
criteria set forth under education code.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:23.000
There are two areas that the district is highly concerned about in the petition.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Number one is the support for the English learners and compliance with state laws for

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:32.000
English learners, and two, support for students with disabilities and compliance with state

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
laws for students with disabilities.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000
English learners and students with disabilities are two of the most vulnerable populations

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:43.000
student groups in the Montebello Unified School District as well as in California.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.000
And this presentation just shows a timeline of the events that took place with the Time

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Community petition.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
So summary of findings.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000
In the area of English learner instruction, there are concerns.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000
The Montebello Unified School District has about 33% English learners and their needs are

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
great.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.000
In the review of Time's petition, we found, one, that it does not meet the legal requirement

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.000
for monitoring reclassified fluent English proficient students.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:16.000
The petition states reclassified students' progress will be monitored for two years, but

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000
RFEP students should be monitored for four years.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:24.000
In addition, it does not include metrics for the redesignation of English learners.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.000
While the petition does state the types of assessments to be administered, it does lack

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.000
the scores and or performance levels that would constitute redesignation.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:39.000
And three, there's no clear delineation of when designated and integrated English language

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
development is provided and how.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.000
It was also not clear how students will be provided designated English language development

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.000
during the school day that is aligned to the ELD standards and LPAC scores.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:57.000
And we know that in California, English learners must receive both designated and integrated

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.000
ELD until reclassification, and this petition does not make that clear.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:10.000
In the area of special education, the petition's description regarding the charter services

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000
to the students with disabilities is insufficient.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:18.000
It does not explain how the charter school will provide special education and related

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.000
services to its students in the event the SELPA does not accept it as a member.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:27.000
There is no reference to extended school year and whether it will be available.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:32.000
There's also no discussion of transition requirements for special education students.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:37.000
And it also improperly asserts that low achieving students will undergo the student success

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.000
team within the framework of the response to intervention process prior to requiring

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
the charter school to assess them.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:50.000
In addition for most vulnerable student groups who are English learners and with a disability,

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:56.000
the description of the individualized education plan team fails to include a participant

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:02.000
who possesses the requisite expertise in language acquisition for students duly identified

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
as both a student with special need and an English learner.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.000
The special education plan included in the position does not indicate how the charter

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:15.000
will meet the needs of students with disability who have moderate to severe disabilities

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000
or who require an alternative curriculum.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:24.000
And finally, the petition is also flawed with respects to its discussion of measurable

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000
pupil outcomes of the three goals listed in the petition.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Two cannot be measured and one does not relate to educational pupil outcomes at all.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:38.000
The suspension expulsion plan does not address alternative methods of correction or restorative justice.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:43.000
There is also no mention of physical education, which is a two year requirement in California.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.000
So overall, there are numerous issues with the petition justifying its denial more than

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
the district could identify here and now.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:55.000
And that like Montebello Unified School District urges the State Board of Education to deny

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000
the time community charter school petition.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
So we conclude with that presentation.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Thank you for your time.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Thank you very much.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.000
At this point, I think we're going to go to public comments.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:15.000
So we want to open the phone line for the public comment queue and we should put the

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:20.000
public comment slide back up there.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Members of the public wishing to provide comment on this item may do so by calling

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.000
712-432-0075.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.000
And is somebody putting the slide back up?

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Yes, they're putting the slide back up.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000
There we go.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.000
And then entering access code 651905 pound.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Wait for the operator prompts to press star six.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Then another prompt to press one to enter the queue.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000
And do we have any public comments?

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.000
We have several public comments right now.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000
All right.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Thank you.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.000
I guess I should say that we encourage you to state your name and affiliation for the

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000
record.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Turn down your volume on your computer if you're listening to the live feed.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Speakers will be limited to one minute each.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.000
And is the translator there to provide the instructions in Spanish for callers needing

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:28.000
translation of their input?

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Yes, the translators are on.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Okay.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
I will be the translator taking the first question.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000
I am ready.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Can you guys hear me okay?

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Yes, we can.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Very well.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.000
All right.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Are we ready for our first public caller?

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Can we please get the Spanish translation of the public comments before we start?

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Do you want to hear the instructions in Spanish?

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Yes.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Translator, can you please read the instructions for callers in Spanish?

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Absolutely.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:15.000
For the public hearing, if you can please call the phone number 712-432-0075.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:21.000
You will be asked for the access code 651-905 and the number key.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Listen to the message and when indicated, press an asterisk 6 and when indicated again,

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.000
press 1.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:33.000
When it is your turn, an operator will ask you to say your name and affiliation in English

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
and your intervention will begin.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Your turn starts now.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Say it.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:46.000
My name is represento and I need a translator.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Okay.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Let's resume public comment.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Okay.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.000
First caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record and begin speaking.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Your time starts now.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Hi.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000
I am a founder of Tom community schools.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Hello.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Your time starts.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Go ahead.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Good day.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:20.000
I am a filmmaker with the LA based production company known for Sundance, winter, the birth

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
of a nation.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:26.000
I am currently a writer producer director for our latest film project.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.000
I am a co-founder of the Cleveland police working with the foundation.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
I reside in Atlanta.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:39.000
I am original time community schools founder and I worked with the youth policy institute

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
and Camino Nuevo schools.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.000
I have to stress that time addresses a great need in the educational school system.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Touching the underserved communities of color to provide lasting impact that is so important

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000
especially in these times of racial arrest and racial wrecking.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Thank you so much.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record and begin speaking.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Your time starts now.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Hi.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
My name is Jorge Moreno.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
I am a parent.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:11.000
I am a parent, physician, board member of time community schools, a business owner,

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.000
and a Manabella resident for over three decades.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.000
My wife and I have raised our seven children in Manabella.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000
We have been working together for more than a decade.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000
We have been working together for more than a decade.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000
We have been working together for more than a decade.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.000
We have been working together for more than a decade.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.000
My wife and I have raised our seven children in Manabella.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000
We have had the privilege of enrolling our children in private schools.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:45.000
This choice is not available to the majority of our community in Manabella.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000
School choice is just unrealistic.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Time community schools offer school choice to families regardless of their income.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:00.000
As a 30-year resident and Manabella business owner, our network is vast and solid.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Our team is well equipped with a broad array of resources.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:11.000
We have connections to Rio Hano Community College and just a vast array of individuals and businesses.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:18.000
And I'm thrilled to know that time community schools is here to make a positive difference in our community.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000
I urge you to vote in favor of our charter petition.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Thank you so much.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

Okay, we'll need you to call back when we're accepting public comment for item 20.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Sorry, thank you.

I'll also send the list that Jackie, I believe, or Candice sent out, or was it Sandra, of what insurances do accept that we have,

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:25.000
We have insurance companies that do accept hospice patients.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
We need you to hang up.

We can hear you. Please begin your comment.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Yeah, I'm also for item number 20.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Okay, we will need you to call in when we are accepting public comment when it is announced that we are accepting public comment for item 20.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Thank you.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Your time starts now.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Good morning. My name is Doug Paszkowski. I'm here for the Montebello Teachers Association.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:05.000
I do want to thank you for your hard work supporting our students, and I do recommend that you follow the CDE recommendation to deny this charter appeal.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:12.000
We do have alternatives in our district. We have the Advanced Technology Center, which provides pathways for our students.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:18.000
There are some major problems with the time charter. First of all, it did apply two years ago as well.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:28.000
They had never found a location. They do consider co-locating with the Advanced Technology Center, which would be a problem because they only have space in the foyers.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:43.000
They also have some major problems with finances. As Lako said, they had $190 in the bank, and they were recommended by the commission just because they promised that they were going to fill out an application for a grant.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:52.000
That's not enough. They don't have the funding to start a school. They don't have a place to start a school, and they're not ready to get a school started.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Thank you so much.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:10.000

Lorraine Richards, Community Parent.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Hello?

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
We can hear you. Please provide your comment.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Okay. Lorraine Richards, Community Parent. I'm speaking to deny the applicant. I attended Montebello High School, which gave me an opportunity as a first-generation Latina to a four-year college, then continue to earn my teaching credential and obtain a master's.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:26.000
I attended MUSD from kinder through 12th grade, which did not hinder my education. I'm a parent of MUSD children. My daughter, a second-generation Montebello High School graduate with a 504, currently completed her first year at a four-year college who earned two semesters of straight A's at the university and my son beginning eighth grade.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:40.000
The current applicant, Time, claims to be a better solution for students, although the poor financial stability of charter is not acceptable. Claiming to apply for a grant that has not been earned is not enough. A quality 21st education has a large budget.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Time gives the whole family, the whole community, a false hope. MUSD is overcoming previous financial mismanagement. The whole family and whole family will not endure another education model that is stricken by financial strife. Please deny this petition. Thank you.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:08.000

Hi, can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you. Please begin your public comment.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Hi, my name is Tavina Quintana. I am an employee of Montebello Unified School District and I'm just calling in because of listening to the gentleman from Time Charter.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:45.000
We do not need any more schools in our district. We have plenty of options. Our graduates are doing amazing things. All the employees are happy with what we have. We don't need any charter schools coming in and trying to take more of our funds than our students, which we're struggling with now.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:54.000
I just want to say that I hope you guys deny the petition. Thank you.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:09.000

Hello, did you wish to provide public comment for item 19?

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:24.000
My name is Vale Hernandez De Luna and I'm representing today's first charter school. I attended TFSS for three years. This school has changed me academically for the best.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:33.000
I'm sorry, excuse me. We're taking public comment for item 19 at this time. We'll need you to call back when we're accepting public comment for item 20.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Thank you.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:42.000
For today's fresh start. Thank you.

Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record and begin speaking. Your time starts now.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Good morning. My name is Lizette Romero and I'm here to lend my support for Time Community Schools. 16 years ago, I was a senior in Dr. Ramirez's English class. He was an amazing teacher who created a student centered class that validated the voices and experiences of a student.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Some of my best memories of high school come from the assignments, community projects, and activities he spearheaded. Dr. Ramirez has had a direct impact on who I am today. I'm proud to say that this year I'm receiving my credential in special education.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:30.000
I've committed myself to helping those students who need the most support as I know Dr. Ramirez has committed himself as well. Also, I'm a parent and I'm excited to say that I want my child to attend Time Community Schools because I know he will receive the kind of education that I'm looking for.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Rigorous, engaging, and student centered. I ask the State Board of Education to vote yes because the Montebello community needs this school. Thank you for your time.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record and begin speaking. Your time starts now.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Hi, my name is Lamar Brown, co-founder of Time Community Schools and president of the board. I'm currently a change management and communications lead at the Top UC School. As a board member, I will work to ensure the school's success, particularly in the areas of student enrollment and community outreach, areas in which I have developed expertise.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:27.000
In these unprecedented times, it is more important than ever to find safe and innovative ways to connect and build relationships with families. I will continue to provide Dr. Ramirez with strategies and best practices to engage all families with the goal of ensuring that TCS school's population is a reflection of the diversity of Montebello community.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:42.000
I am honored to be a part of this highly capable team that is intent on equity and outstanding results. Today is a clear sign of our dedication and relentless focus to bring Montebello an innovative school not to ensure student success. I urge you to approve our petition. Thank you.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record and begin speaking. Your time starts now.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Hi, Ramel Antoine from the California Charter Schools Association, calling to speak in support of San Charter School. We want to say that this petition is a high quality petition. They have worked with our staff at the Charter Schools Association to ensure that they're implementing best practices and have a high quality document that meets the legal requirements.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:39.000
We also want to say that the PDE did say at the HCCS that they would have likely recommended approval if it weren't for the projected budget cuts, but instead now are concerned with the projected startup funds. With SB 98, that would allow them more time to plan. They would have more than ample time to raise the funds.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Additionally, they have found suitable facilities that would house the school once they're able to open. And we want to say we recommend our support for San Charter School. Thank you.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record and begin speaking. Your time starts now.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Hello, can you hear me? Hello? Yes, we can hear you. Your time has started.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:19.000
My name is Carlos. I'm urging you to please reject the time community school application. Mr. Ramirez and his associates have offered a very poorly developed educational program that would greatly affect the very same students that we want.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Can you please get closer to your phone or microphone? Yes. Is that better? That's much better. Thank you. We'll respect your time.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Oh, thank you. So my name is Carlos. Good morning. I'm urging you to please reject the time community school application. Mr. Ramirez and his associates have offered a very poorly developed educational program that would greatly hurt the very same students they say they want to help.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:55.000
It was abundantly clear that time community schools rushed together a poorly developed academic plan to open up the school with very little awareness of the community or how to properly run a school and more importantly, how to educate students.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Their plan from the get-go has had many flaws and it failed to meet 9 out of 15 original educational guidelines to open a charter school. They have no expertise in their educational program.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:12.000
They have no experience in managing a charter school. They presented an incomplete academic program to the Montebello school board.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:20.000
They had no answer to how to address students with special needs or English learners leaving behind vulnerable populations.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Please consider the best interest of the Montebello Unified Community and reject their application. Thank you.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record and begin speaking. Your time starts now.

Hi, this is Angela DeRamos representing the California Teachers Association.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:49.000
CTA recommends that the State Board of Education vote to deny the petition for the establishment of time. The association opposes time's petition for the following reasons.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:56.000
They are fiscally unable, unsustainable given their lack of startup funds and the current state budget uncertainties.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Secondly, the petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive description of most of the required elements, including the item on pupil outcomes, on suspension and expulsion procedures, as well as dispute resolution procedures.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:18.000
We urge you to deny this petition. Thank you.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record and begin speaking. Your time starts now.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Caller, did you wish to make a public comment for item 19?

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Hello? Yes, we can hear you. Please state your name and affiliation and begin speaking.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:47.000
I'm waiting for item 21.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.000
One moment and we'll get you a translator.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Okay. Thank you.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Translator, can you please announce when you're on the line?

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Sir, please state your name and affiliation and begin speaking when you wish.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Sir?

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Hello, am I on the queue? My name is Christine Dimas.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Is our call manager here?

01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Did you hear that?

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Hi, my name is Christine Dimas. I am a stakeholder in the Montebello Unified School District.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:18.000
I'm recommending that you deny time charter. They sound very well-meaning.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:25.000
However, the financial aspect of this particular charter is not in place for our community.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Our community has already suffered enough corruption based on what's been happening in the news with regards to Measure GS bond money.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:57.000
We're still recovering. We do not need another organization or entity coming into our district ill-prepared to not just financially, but to teach our children. Thank you.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:06.000
We have no additional callers in the queue at this time. We do have an additional 17 callers that are on the line that it appears may not have entered the queue.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.000
We're going to check with them to see if they would like to provide public comments.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Thank you.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Hello, caller. Please state your name. I'm sorry. Would you like to provide a public comment for item 19?

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Hello, caller. Would you like to provide a comment for item 19?

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Please understand this is for item 19. If you've called in for another item, we respectfully ask that you hang up at this time and call back following the item when it's presented.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:37:03.000
This is only for item 19 and callers should only be on the line for item 19. Thank you.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Hello, caller. Did you wish to make a comment for item 19?

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:24.000

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:33.000

Next caller, would you like to provide a public comment for item 19?

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Good morning. Can you hear me?

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Yes, we can hear you. Would you like to make a comment for item 19?

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Yes, yes. I'm calling in support of Time Charter Schools. Good morning. My name is Gabby Hernandez and I am a Montebello resident and a mother of two.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:38:10.000
And based on my experiences and what I have witnessed with my own children and based on the data that I have read, the city of Montebello is in need of an alternative, innovative high school option for our families and students, one that is more career-based, hands-on, that's based on our students' interests.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:19.000
I believe Time Charter will provide a more college-focused preparation program where students can actually begin to explore their interests and put their skills and strengths to use.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Time Charter's innovative teaching approach will better prepare our students for their future careers and will allow them to work in collaboration with teachers and other professionals within our community.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Our students deserve this opportunity to be better prepared for their futures. They deserve this opportunity to have access to better support systems.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:48.000
I fully support Time Charter School. Please vote in favor of Time Charter School. Thank you for your time.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Thank you.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:39:02.000

Hello caller, would you like to provide a public comment for item 19?

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
I already provided my comment.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Okay, we're going to disconnect you from the line at this time, okay?

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Okay, thank you. Thank you.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:36.000

Yes, we can hear you. Did you want to provide a comment for item 19?

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Can you hear me?

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:49.000
For Time Community School?

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Translator, we need you.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Yes sir, would you like to provide a public comment for item 19?

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:19.000
I didn't hear how they were talking. I don't know how it is. I just wanted to say a few words about the school.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:48.000
I just wanted to say that I really don't want this school to be closed.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:41:01.000
My son goes to this school. He's in 10th grade. It's a good school. He has learned here more than I have noticed in other schools. So from my heart, I just wanted to say that I don't want this school to be closed. That was all.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Translator, can you please ask what item he's called? What school?

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
My name is Alejo Salinas.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:17.000
What school are you calling for?

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.000
John Henry.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Thank you. We will need him to call back for John Henry. That is the next item on the agenda.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.000
To the same number you mean?

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Yes.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Yes sir.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:50.000
What time would that happen?

01:41:50.000 --> 01:42:04.000
We don't know. It will be at the conclusion of this public comment and hearing.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Probably in an hour.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:37.000
I just want to be sure that everyone who's on the phone line understands that we are only taking comments for item 19, which is the time charter school in case there are others who might be queued up for a later item.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
And they would call back.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Translator, could you repeat that in Spanish that everyone on the phone line should be for item 19 only?

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Absolutely.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Absolutely.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Great.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:14.000
I don't know if you could clarify that people should hang up and call back if they are for another school.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:24.000
If they are already in line, they should hang up and call back.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:29.000
We will resume with callers in the participant queue at this time.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Next caller would you like to make a public comment for item 19?

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Next caller would you like to make a public comment for item 19?

01:43:49.000 --> 01:44:01.000

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:10.000

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Hello caller, did you wish to provide a public comment for item 19?

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:19.000
No, thank you, but I would like to remain on the call. Thank you.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:25.000
I'm sorry, we have to disconnect you right now. You'll need to call in for the item that you're providing public comments on.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:30.000
I'm not providing any comment. I just want to listen in.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Okay.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Hello caller, did you wish to provide a public comment for item 19?

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000

Please state your name and affiliation for the record and begin speaking.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Hello. Hi, my name is Aiden Colons. I am speaking on behalf of my full today's special total academy.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:17.000
I would like to request that my flow stays open to the benefit of keeping our school site open in my opinion will outlay the risk of closing out schools.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:21.000
It is my belief that...

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:32.000
I'm sorry, caller. You'll need to call back when we're hearing your item. Right now we are accepting public comment for item 19, time community school.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Okay, have they done for today's fresh start yet?

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:42.000
No, we are not on today's fresh start yet. That is, we've got one more item to go after this one.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Okay, sorry about that.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.000
No problem. Thank you.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Do we have to call back?

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Yes, we will need you to call back when we are hearing public comment for item 21.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Okay, thank you.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Thank you.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Next caller, did you wish to provide public comment for item 19 for time community school?

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:22.000

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:31.000

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Okay, you will be disconnected at this time. Thank you.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Next caller, did you wish to provide public comment for item 19, time community school?

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Okay, we will disconnect you at this time. Thank you.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Are we done with public comment then?

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Okay, Linda, we're finished with public comment on this item.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:10.000
Didn't hear that confirmation.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:18.000
All right, so we are now going to close public comment at 10 51 a.m.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:25.000
And commence board discussion in action.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:30.000
First, I want to ask Ting's son as our state board liaison if she has any initial comments.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Then we'll ask board members if they have any clarifying questions or comments as part of our board discussion.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Hi, Sue. Yeah, a couple of things.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:50.000
In looking at the the the documentation around this particular charter,

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:57.000
while there have been certain comments around lack of detail in some of the areas,

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:01.000
I do believe that they do have a strong educational program in it.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:13.000
From looking at the documents, it's just like both CDE as well as the other as the county also felt that they had provided a strong program.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:26.000
In this presentation, the the presenter or the petitioner seemed to focus more on the background of the of the people on the board.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:36.000
And I think that was a way to help us understand more of the folks who are part of the operations and startup of this school.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:54.000
I hope that they have an opportunity to maybe go a little bit more into their educational program because I did find that it was very innovative and that it was very much a rigorous and program that supports the student population that they are targeting.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:49:12.000
The financial piece as well, we had some discussion on the budgets as well yesterday in looking at some of the comments and the additional information that has been brought forth around the the budget.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:19.000
I also feel that the petitioners have the means and the resources to start up the school.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:24.000
So I will have my fellow board members ask their questions.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:35.000
But I do feel that this is a this petition and the petitioners are in a good place on this particular school.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:47.000
And we also have heard that the Los Angeles County Board of Education is also willing to take on the oversight of the school.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:54.000
All right. Thank you very much. So we are now open for board discussion.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:50:02.000
And let me see if I can track our participants here.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:10.000
Patricia Rutgers having some technology problems. So she is going to text us and let us know if she has her hand up.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Okay, I know I also had technology problems. This is a day for those problems.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:25.000
I have a request to speak from member Strauss and member Navo. So we'll start with them.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Eileen.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
Eileen, are you with us? There we go. Great.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Yes, I was trying to lower my hand down to not confuse you. I apologize.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:47.000
I wanted to clarify. So I'm wondering what the and maybe members and you tell me if we need the petitioner.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.000
There was a question about the facility.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Did that get discussed and clarified? That was a question about would they be using Prop 39 and requesting facility in the Montebello Unified School District?

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Or how would they plan to address the facility issue?

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:10.000
We should, I guess, ask the petitioner to clarify that.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Dr. Ramirez, how are you planning to find a facility? Have you identified one? What's your plan?

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Yes, ma'am. Thank you for the question. So we did apply for Prop 39 to Montebello and made the request in time.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:39.000
When Montebello did send their response to that, the rate that Montebello was attempting to charge us for use of facilities was way above market value.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:51.000
And so for us, in terms of our desire to be fiscally sound, we decided that we had to absolutely look for private facilities to lease because it just made most sense.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:52:01.000
So right now we are in negotiations with two facilities to lease them for the upcoming school year upon approval.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:08.000
My next question, Dr. Ramirez, is I know there was a question about your plan.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:17.000
By the way, I think the college ready college preparatory mission really hits the target of what the state's goals are for students.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:27.000
And I appreciate the commitment. I didn't hear as much specifics about your English learner plans and your students with disabilities plans.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:35.000
So I wonder if you could at least highlight for us what I know a member song said there was more there, but we didn't hear it in the presentation today.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:39.000
I'd appreciate you addressing those. Absolutely. Thank you.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Thank you. So, yes. So, you know, again, I appreciate you acknowledging our program.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:53:00.000
We are happy that it's a CTE program because we believe that that in itself is very engaging and really puts that energy and motivation to students to want to invest themselves in this curriculum, particularly for special education and EL's.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:06.000
Of course, we're very committed to serving all of our students in terms of our special education.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:11.000
We are, of course, working with the LAC.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:22.000
We are committed to providing a robust continuum of partnerships to ensure that all the needs of our population are addressed within the.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:33.000
The program itself, the way that the time learning model works, there is absolutely time for the teachers to differentiate instruction, for we will be hiring a special education teacher year one to support students.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Also, we will have instructional aids available year one as well that will be supporting students in the classrooms.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:47.000
In terms of our EL program, we're very excited about our EL program as well.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Twenty percent of the population within the high school population is EL.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:59.000
Our time learning model also very much integrates EL standards within the program.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Teachers will be provided SADAY training, GLAD training to ensure that students have access to content.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:16.000
We will have our counselor who will be our coordinator of our EL students who will work alongside me to monitor student growth.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Of course, we'll utilize our formative and summative assessments and utilize all our different resources to ensure that students are making progress.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:32.000
We will use the state designations to ensure that the students are working towards proficiency.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Thank you.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:38.000
Any other questions you're good Eileen.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:42.000
I'll go to member Navo.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Thank you.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:48.000
I have a couple of questions for the petitioner first.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:54.000
So, and I appreciate board member Strauss your question that helped took some things off of the list.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:01.000
But can you address the measurable pupil outcomes, the concern around staffing, addressing students with disabilities?

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:06.000
I know you talked about it briefly, but what's your staffing for the year look like for 110 students?

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:15.000
And then can you address element 10, the concern CDE had around suspension and expulsions and the placement of students in alternative settings?

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Yes, sir.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:25.000
Well, in terms of the first part of the question was staffing correct for special ed.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:29.000
For the whole school for 110.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
That was your first year.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:34.000
All staffing for year one.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Yeah, for 110 students.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Yes, so I'm all staffing for year one.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:46.000
We will have, I believe.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:54.000
I'm looking at right now we will have, I believe.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Five full time teachers, three part time teachers, a sped, a sped, a full time sped teacher.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:13.000
We will also have instructional aid year one, and a school counselor, in addition to our support staff.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Okay, and your budget that you're that you project covers that staffing.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Absolutely, sir.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:28.000
And talk to me about the measurable outcome, the element 10 suspension expulsion procedures the finding CDE has there.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:29.000
We do.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:34.000
So what the findings said, my understanding of the findings is saying that we do not address growth for the subgroups.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:41.000
But the way that it was written, and I think it's just a matter of clarification, what we wrote is that all subgroups will increase 2% annually.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:48.000
And our rationale behind that was that we we feel that all subgroups, every student within the school should have the same expectation of growth.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:57.000
And so the clarification would really be that we would just need to, like, instead of saying all subgroups, the way that we listed that also was increased by 2%, just to list them out.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:00.000
I think that was the point of clarification.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Okay, thank you. That's helpful. But I was talking about suspension expulsion, where they were defining is that there's an automatic placement of pupils and an interim alternative educational setting.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Contrary to Edco.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:19.000
Yes, so I'll answer that the best I can and then john Lemo who is also on the line can help clarify for me.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:29.000
So my understanding is that when we submitted the petition, the language was submitted for, it wasn't submitted for the county.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:42.000
And so that that language wasn't wasn't changed when it was submitted to the state. So it's my understanding that it's just a technical, it's a technical correction that needs to be to be made to reflect the state language.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:43.000
Okay.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:49.000
And then I have a question for CDE, maybe it's for Stephanie.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Stephanie, the petitioner made a statement that in the ACCS meeting, CDE would have approved the school.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:11.000
If the budget issues weren't a result of, I guess, you know, COVID-19 and the May revise and all of the implications that you mentioned. Is that true?

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:22.000
So the only the only decision we ever had with this particular school was for denial.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Yes, we had some serious issues with and concerns, obviously, about their ability to fiscally implement the program and to stay fiscally viable.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:51.000
But if you look at our summary of required charter elements in the a one, we did also have several nos there in terms of, as you mentioned a minute ago, the people outcomes, the suspension expulsion procedures, the dispute resolution procedures.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:58.000
Their goals to address the state priority. So there were other there were other issues.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:10.000
But I will state that their their design their educational program design was not was not an issue.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Okay, so that that that thank you, Stephanie. And then last last question.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:31.000
Okay, there are over in the correspondence folder, there are over 20 letters to deny this charter, and many of them call out a 3.2 million dollar deficit.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:43.000
They're they're they're essentially the same letter and I'm trying to figure out as I look through the documents where that's coming from, and I'm assuming these are not these are incorrect.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:46.000
The amount is incorrect.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:56.000
We did not we did not see anything about a 3.2 million deficit. When we did our analysis of their of their fiscal.

01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Okay, that's that's what I needed now. Thank you.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Okay, Member Glover Woods.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:16.000
Thank you. This question is either for Stephanie from CD and possibly for the representative from Los Angeles County Office of Education.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:28.000
Stephanie, when you were providing the overview, you closed by mentioning that the Los Angeles County Board of Education was willing to authorize.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:49.000
I wanted to get a little bit more clarification as to why they are willing to authorize when the Los Angeles County Board of Education had recommended to deny just to get some clarification on what may have changed from the time the petition was submitted to the time we're hearing the information.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:01:04.000
So just to clarify the LA County Board is willing to take over the oversight of the school not authorize the school, the state board would still be authorizing the school if they chose to move in that direction if they chose to approve this this appeal.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:10.000
And so, in that sense, they're not actually authorizing.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:26.000
You know, we can we can definitely ask the county as to why they agreed to do this. My guess is that the law has changed and the school will need to go back to the local level to be approved the next time around and it often helps if, if it's already at the local level

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:38.000
the benefit of being the oversight provider when that renewal comes up again, but we can definitely ask the county as well.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:44.000
If there are any other reasons why they why they agreed to take the oversight of the school.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:55.000
Thank you, that would be helpful and I appreciate the clarification. So if the representative from Lakeville could also speak to why the decision to do the oversight that would be helpful.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Absolutely. Thank you for the question. And I think it does it yields from the change in law in which oversight would go back to a local level, either the county or the district.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:11.000
And I know my director had conversations with the state Board of Education regarding that.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:26.000
But that was the intent is that knowing that the law is going to have the school come back to local more just a conversation in about what's what could go for us in terms of the oversight.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Thank you.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:37.000
All right, Matt your hand is still up. Are you, do you have another question.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:40.000
Okay, and is now down.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:46.000
I don't see any other board questions at this all member Strauss.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
There you go.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:52.000
I just wanted Stephanie, I'm sorry don't go away yet.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:03:04.000
So, I just want to the issue the budget came up, I actually think the 3.5 million from the letters is probably the Montebello problem because the district itself has had some budget trouble.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:18.000
I want to know from the CD analysis now, is the budget physically found, if, if we recommend going forward. Do you believe the budget plan is solid.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Stephanie. Yes, yes, I would say that the budget plan that they're that the plan that they submitted with their original petition is solid in terms of if they, if they get all of the startup money that they hope to get.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:52.000
None of that, as I could see is is finalized yet. So if they get all the startup money, and if the deferrals do not impact them greatly in repaying all of the receivables they have to sell in order to stay solvent for the first couple of years.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:04:18.000
So, if that all works out for them. Yes, I think that that they could be viable but you know those are big gifts, and we're trying to be responsible here at the department with, with the fiscal outlook, because there's so much uncertainty over the next couple of years but I would put those ifs in before the viability.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:30.000
That raises a question for me and I see Brenna that you also have your hand up I'll come right to you in a moment. There was some conversation here about 2021 versus 2020.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:59.000
And I want to understand whether the questions of I want to understand I guess from the petitioner whether they were proactively preferring to be considered for 2021 as opposed to 2020 or whether you were feeling like the finances were, etc were going to be adequate sooner than 2021.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:02.000
And then I'd love to hear from Stephanie on that as well.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Yes.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:17.000
In our budget that we submitted that we submitted we do not include any grants in that so our viability is just based on

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:32.000
It's not it's not based on those outside sources those those things to come in like our viability is based on what we submitted and we do have a cash reserve on the adequate crash, crash reserve cash reserve for all three years so I do want to make that part clear in regards to the

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:48.000
The reason why we were actively seeking a delayed opening was because our instructional calendar year is very unique. Our school was slated to open July 1, 2020. So as of as of right now we're already a week past our school start time.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:06:03.000
And so our instructional calendar so it's so key into the way that we provide instruction, the way that we do PD, the way that we look at data. And so we really thought that it was an important element that we would like to have opportunity to start the way that we have planned for it within our petition.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:17.000
Obviously, the other part of it is the COVID part that did make other elements challenging in terms of being able to open up this year. So with all that said, you know, we, we would really appreciate that opportunity to have the delayed opening.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:31.000
That would be a preference. Yes, ma'am. Okay. Stephanie, do you want to have, do you have any further comment on that? No, I believe that I hope you can get this right. SB 98 allows new.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Sorry, Judy's waving at me.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:49.000
Sorry, this is Judy size with the State Board of Education. The education trailer bill allows a charter school that had a scheduled opening of the 2019 2020 2021 school year to delay opening for one year without a material revision.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:07:01.000
They just need to notify the authorizer by July 15. So it'd be up to the charter school, whether or not they want to delay opening for a year. Thank you. That's very helpful.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Um, Brenda, you were waiting.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Yes, so I have a question.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:24.000
So we just heard something a little different not sure if that messes with the question I was going to ask, but if we were to agree, kind of like yesterday to the one year, waiting one year to open up and the petitioner wasn't financially still by that time and there was still

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:33.000
What ifs would that make this with the school might open or would it be different than different than that?

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:45.000
Again, it depends on the conditions that you all put aside if you do decide to vote to approve it and the conditions.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
All right.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:52.000
I'm not seeing any more.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
Hands raised.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:58.000
Do we have a motion.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:14.000
I'll go ahead and make the motion to approve the charter for a term of five years. And so I need a little assistance here. Do we designate this to start, or will they just have a choice.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:21.000
As we did, I think this is Judy again you can designate them to start if that's your preference.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:34.000
But I believe they said that they want to delay starting so I don't I don't think it's an issue. Yeah, I think given that that their school calendar would have started already last week.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:51.000
So I will, I will make the motion to approve the time community charter for a term of five years with the effect of July 1 2020 with the beginning of instruction.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:09:00.000
And this is similar to yesterday's between July 1 and September 30 2021 gives them that option.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:17.000
We will want them to produce evidence by May of 2021 of their, that they are meeting their, their perspective enrollment for ninth graders of 110 or it could be a little bit more.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:21.000
For the school year.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:41.000
And then that they will to address the making sure that we have a corrected budget based on current information at that time of their startup, that they would submit to the Department of Education a revised budget with the updated information so that they are able to start up for that

02:09:41.000 --> 02:10:03.000
So I would simply remind us that we had some information from Judy science yesterday that the enrollment projections have a standard sort of confidence interval around them.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:06.000
So, yes.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:14.000
So, whatever I think that should be the same as what we asked yesterday. Yes, I agree to that.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Is there a second for that motion?

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:31.000
Ting, do you have those conditions you just read in writing that you can screen share?

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:36.000
I cannot because I had to switch to my iPad.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:51.000
You know, I did have so many people with technology problems. I know. So I don't unless we want to take a break I could try I mean I could maybe send something to staff or something along those lines to project but

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:58.000
I had originally intended to do that. I just am not able to because I had to switch.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Can I clarify a question? Is there anything in the list Ting that has facility on it?

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:11.000
It doesn't. I did not include facilities.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:18.000
It sounds like they had facilities, but we do want to make sure that the facilities would still be in place a year from now.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:28.000
So we could add that to the condition. This is Judy science I think what we had yesterday was something where they would have to have a facility in place by May.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:40.000
In order to allow time for CDE to conduct a pre fight inspection like they do for all the charters in time, especially since they're opening July 1st or there's calendar started July 1st. I believe I heard him say.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:51.000
So we could add something that they will provide necessary facility information to CDE in order to allow time for a pre opening inspection.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:57.000
Can I read back what I wrote regarding the conditions just to make sure we have them correctly Ting?

02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:01.000
That would be very helpful. Thank you. Please.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:13.000
You would move to approve the charter for a term of five years. It would be effective July 1, 2020. However, they would start instruction for the 21-22 school year.

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:29.000
It would be a five year term with a delayed opening. They need to produce evidence by May 2021 of their perspective and enrollment for the 21-22 school year plus or minus the 25% as we discussed yesterday.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:36.000
They will need to submit to CDE a revised budget with updated information.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:44.000
I think I heard May 2021 to show that it is current for the 21-22 school year.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:52.000
Is that correct? We could just make it consistent May 2021. Just as they would be for their enrollment.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:13:01.000
May 2021 so that they have a budget for the 21-22 school year. Is that correct? Yes, that's correct.

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:12.000
And evidence that will add in evidence that their facilities will be ready to be occupied.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:27.000
Yes, they would provide evidence regarding occupation of facilities including I believe they have the occupancy permits and all of the information that is necessary for CDE to conduct a pre opening site visit.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:32.000
The facility inspection. Yes, yes.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:41.000
And oh, yes, and if they could also correct any of the deficiencies that were identified in the petition by CDE. Yes, that's similar to yesterday. Yes.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:48.000
And then if we could set, do we want to set a date of, I don't know, May 1st or May 15th, just so everything's consistent.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:58.000
For all of these, that would be May 15th. Yeah, assuming that's a weekday, especially if they're going to open July 1st. Yeah, maybe May 1st since they're opening July 1st.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:04.000
Yes.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Okay, so Linda, we still need a second on that motion.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:24.000
Can I also, can I also ask if we should make that under the oversight of the county or will this just happen with the county's agreement after we make the approval?

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:31.000
We don't need to put that in the motion. No, I think, I think it would be good to put that into the motion since that is something the board has never done.

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:36.000
So I think that's a good point to delegate oversight to Los Angeles County Office of Education.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:43.000
And Patricia tells me May 1st is a Saturday, so we will adjust it to the appropriate Friday.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:51.000
30 days, 30 days, 30 days, 30 days, 30 days.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:54.000
I was trying to sing it to you. Thank you.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:10.000
All right, so we're adjusting to April 30th and then we were approving with those conditions and that the school be under the oversight of the Los Angeles County Board of Education.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:24.000
Okay, so assuming folks have now followed that exchange about the various conditions, is there a second for that motion?

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:25.000
I'll second.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Or Jim, go ahead. Jim did it.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:31.000
Okay, Jim has seconded the motion. Is there further discussion?

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:34.000
Patricia Rucker had a question.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:37.000
Okay.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:40.000
How are we going to get that from her?

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:46.000
Can she, can she come on?

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:53.000
Patricia, you need to unmute.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:56.000
Go ahead.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:08.000
Patricia, we can't hear you.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:13.000
I can hear her. Oh, you can? We can't.

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:16.000
How many people are hearing Patricia?

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:17.000
Board members can hear.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:25.000
Everybody on the Zoom call can hear, but we can't hear in this CDE room. So I don't know, does that mean the public can hear or not?

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:30.000
I do not know.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:35.000
We need a technologist.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:43.000
Well, maybe Patricia could ask her question and one of us could repeat it and then. Yeah, why don't we do that? Okay, go that way.

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Patricia, go ahead with your question and then I just want to acknowledge that I see Cynthia in the queue, Patricia.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:18.000
I'm getting texts from friends that people cannot hear her on the live stream.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:25.000
She would like to have the conditions written down so that she knows exactly what she's voting for.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:39.000
Well, she also would like to make sure that the conditions address all the areas that CDE identified in the petition that were not appropriately addressed.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Right.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:47.000
So I think we're going to need to get this in some way and into writing.

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:52.000
I don't know if somebody can.

02:17:52.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Do you know how to like send a screenshot or something to someone there, Judy?

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:12.000
Ting, if you will email to Chad Owens here, I'll give you his email address and then we can put it up on the screen.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
Okay.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:19.000
Okay, so give me a minute to do that.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
We have some more conversation.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:29.000
We have a couple of other board members to take your time to do that while we hear from Cynthia and Matt.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
Cynthia, you're next.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:32.000
Thank you.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:33.000
Thank you.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:40.000
It was a clarification question, which actually might get clarified from the written portion of the motion that we're going to see.

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:55.000
But I wanted to ensure that in the motion, if there are still fiscal concerns, once the budget is submitted to CDE that that would come back to the board before moving forward.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:19:06.000
And I'm wondering if these conditions are very much like what we looked at yesterday, whether we could simply amend those conditions and have someone put it up.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:12.000
I think Judy's been keeping careful track of the conversation.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:18.000
I do think that Member Rucker is asking for additional President Darling-Hammond because she wants to...

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:24.000
Once we get it up on the screen, we can do a checklist, right?

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:33.000
I believe that that list did cover virtually everything, but if there's something left out, we could talk about it when we see it.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:37.000
Okay, Matt, you're next.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
I tried to lower my hand.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:40.000
Oh, thank you.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Board member Glover answered my asked my question and I appreciate that.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:50.000
I guess I will say that, you know, I understanding the initial proposal from board member Ting.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:51.000
I appreciate it.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:20:04.000
I reluctantly will support it, but I think that the concern for me is the volume of community members that have made the effort to say they don't support the school right now.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
And I think that's the challenge for me.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:11.000
I'm just putting that out there and I appreciate the proposal, Ting.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
Yeah, I understand.

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:19.000
I understand and I have to say that this is serving a specific community and I felt

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:37.000
badly that I believe that there would be more community support if we were in face-to-face meeting because there is a large number of Hispanic and second language

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:51.000
support and it is very difficult on this type of this type of public comment for a population to come in and understand when they're supposed to call in what numbers are supposed to press.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:21:11.000
I was going to actually ask the petitioners of, you know, were there other additional members from the public who would have called in, but for the some of the technical issues with this and I felt the same way with the AC2S meeting.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:20.000
This is Judy Sias. I think we can't presume who would have would not have called in or who would not have traveled up to Sacramento.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:24.000
I don't just I would like to clarify that for the record. I don't think we can.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
Okay.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:29.000
It was a wonder for me.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Brenna, did you want to your hand went up and down.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:35.000
Yeah, I had the same question.

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:51.000
I think what might make sense would be for us to take a brief break and allow the staff to work together to get the conditions on a piece of paper that everyone agrees to that.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:22:06.000
We don't know whether the board will agree, but at least the motion maker and the staff agree represents the intention, and we can come back and look at that and then make our vote.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:21.000
So I was thinking if we went to 1130, which was when I was estimating we might finish, I would simply call the lunch break at that time until about noon and then we would, you know, go on to the other two hearings.

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:31.000
So I guess the question is, how quickly do we think we can do that should we just call the 30 minute lunch break now and come back and and do our vote.

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:45.000
I think we need that clarity we need the opportunity to talk about what conditions meet the concerns that people have raised. And I think we might need a minute to, you know, really be clear about that rather than.

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:57.000
I agree and I think rather than waiting for me to try to type something up I would rather have staff assist us with putting together the actual the motion as Judy.

02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:03.000
Yeah, Linda, I would suggest we take our lunch break and then we'll bring this back up right after lunch.

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:14.000
Before we take the break, there was a clarification that the oversight would be by the LA County Office of Education not the LA County Board. So just excuse me.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:17.000
Yes, I'm sorry. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Thanks.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
County Office of Education. I'm sorry.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:35.000
So we're going to take our 30 minute lunch break let's come back at noon. They give you 33 minutes, take, don't, don't get too excited but we'll come back and we'll have it written and we can consider and vote at that time.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:43.000
And don't leave the room, because you might not get back in just stop your video and your audio.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:50.000
All right.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:59.000
Document on the screen, which had the, the motion.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
Chad.

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:08.000
We want to go back to the previous document that was on the screen.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:13.000
One minute.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:21.000
I wasn't saying how smoothly things went yesterday. I think that was Kim I think she jinxed us.

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:31.000
Technology has been challenging today.

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:34.000
Chad, can we change the screen.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:48.000
Do we want to get back to the conditions that were yes they're bringing up what was previously up there.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:52.000
Do we still have the petitioners on the.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:56.000
Yes, I think I saw.

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
Yeah.

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:09.000
Yes, I'm on. Okay. I wondered if you, if you would want to address a support that you have from the community on your charter.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
Yes, absolutely.

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:28.000
So, we do have 133 intent, intent to enroll forms that we've gathered. Also we have over 180 letters of support. We, that we did include in the charter petition that was sent to see.

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:41.000
Those interest forms and those letters were sent to the CDE as part of the overall package because that's, that was what we were asked to send what was sent to LACO and that's what we sent to LACO to show the support of the community.

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:47.000
So we do have quite a bit of community support.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:50.000
We now have the conditions here.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Somebody else who wanted to be recognized.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:26:08.000
I'm sorry. Is that Eileen? Yeah, I just had a clarifying question. This is supposed to start as a ninth grade. So I'm assuming that the students that you had had interest in were entering ninth graders.

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:23.000
And if you wait a year, and you still start with ninth grade, won't you have to identify different students to start the program or will you plan to start with 10th graders that identified as ninth graders.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:28.000
Unfortunately, we would have to recruit again.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:43.000
Students to start in the ninth grade to follow the petitions opening plan, but I do believe with the interest that we have that we would very much be able to reach our enrollment goals.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:47.000
Okay, thank you.

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:53.000
Would you like to restate the motion.

02:26:53.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Yes, so now we have it on the screen. I also want to make sure that member Rucker is able to see this as well.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:05.000
Yes, she is with us. She can see it. Okay.

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:19.000
In here. Great. All right. So, so moved to approve the time charter school petition for a term of five years effective July 1, 2020.

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:26.000
The school would delay opening the start of instruction in the 2021-22 school year.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:35.000
Time will produce evidence that they have met the perspective enrollment for 2021-22 school year plus or minus 25%.

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:45.000
Time will submit to CDA revised budget with updated information to show that time is fiscally solvent and able to open in the 21-22 school year.

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:55.000
Time will submit to CDE evidence of their facilities lease and appropriate tournaments and submit to facilities inspection that is required for all SBE authorizer charter schools.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Time will correct the deficiencies in the petition identified by CDE in the A1 in the A1 and item.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:12.000
All of the all corrected documentation will be submitted to CDE by April 29, 2020.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:20.000
And if there are any questions whether these conditions have been satisfied time will and I can't see my screen.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:25.000
Time will sorry.

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:30.000
Thank you. Time will.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:35.000
Sorry, you have to go down a little bit. You're on number 18.

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:49.000
Okay. Thank you. Okay. There are questions with these conditions and says by time we'll come back to the SBE for resolution and the board delegates oversight to Los Angeles County Office of Education.

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:57.000
Okay. And do we have a second for this motion as stated?

02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:00.000
I second that.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:08.000
Jim Jim Jim. Is there any further discussion?

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:11.000
I'm not seeing any hands raised.

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:17.000
All right, we'll take a vote and Karen I think you need to manage the roll call vote. Okay.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:23.000
Linda. Yes, Cynthia.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:26.000
Yes, Jim.

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:29.000
Yes, Matt.

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:32.000
Yes, Brenna.

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:39.000
Yes, I day.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:42.000
Yes, Eileen.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:45.000
Yes, Ting.

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
Yes.

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:51.000
And Patricia Rucker.

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:59.000
Patricia, you have to call back in the phone line.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:03.000
Oh, my.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:10.000
And while we're waiting for Patricia, you see her. She's up.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:16.000
She's on the screen. Yeah.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:25.000
Well, she has to call into a different line, because her zoom line isn't working so we're going to have to wait a minute for her to call back in, I guess.

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:31.000
So while we're waiting for her to call it I have a question about the next item, Karen.

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:37.000
Do we need a break between these items for people to set up on your end or can we move right ahead?

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:44.000
I couldn't read and I said I was trying to send you a message on the chat and the cat seems to be disabled.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:50.000
Oh, what a day you're having.

02:30:50.000 --> 02:31:00.000
Do you vote yes on this set of on this motion with this set of conditions?

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:05.000
What is your vote?

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
No, we can't hear her.

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:13.000
Can you hear me, Pat?

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:18.000
We can't hear you. Oh, dear. No, Linda, I don't think we need a break again.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:22.000
I'm muted.

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:30.000
All right, say it again. Try again.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:33.000
Still not hearing you.

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Oh, Linda.

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:39.000
Yes, she's.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:40.000
She's.

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:45.000
We can't hear her. So she's going to try a different line.

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:53.000
I don't think this works.

02:31:53.000 --> 02:32:10.000
So she's going to call into a different line.

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:16.000
The question I was asking is whether we need a break for the staff after this.

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
I think we can keep on moving.

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:22.000
Okay.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:32.000
Just need to get that last vote recorded.

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:38.000
They're working the problem on this end. She's talking to somebody here. Just not we can't hear.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
Oh, my.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:47.000
Can she just can she talk to you and tell you her vote and you can.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:52.000
Yeah, it has to be recorded as part of the low roll call.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:56.000
Okay.

02:32:56.000 --> 02:33:01.000
We can see you.

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:13.000
Can she do like a thumbs up or a thumbs down?

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:17.000
Okay.

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:44.000
Okay.

02:33:44.000 --> 02:34:05.000
Okay.

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:32.000
Okay.

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:38.000
Yes, she can hear. So Linda, here's what we can do. We're going to hold the vote open.

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:46.000
All right. Hang on one second. Maybe we solved it.

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:55.000
I'm waiting for item 20.

02:34:55.000 --> 02:35:02.000
Thank you.

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
Okay.

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:08.000
Okay. So Linda, what we can do is we can hold the roll call open.

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:20.000
And when they get Patricia, so she can talk to us and we can hear her, then we'll register her vote. We'll go back when we can, but we can proceed with item 20.

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
Okay.

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:25.000
The day for creativity.

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:36.000
We will then move ahead to item 20, which is a public hearing regarding the petition for the renewal of a charter school under the oversight of the State Board of Education.

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:46.000
Consideration of John Henry High, which was denied by the West Contra Costa Unified School District and not acted on by the Contra Costa County Office of Education.

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:52.000
The CDE recommends that the State Board hold a public hearing to deny the request to renew John Henry High.

02:35:52.000 --> 02:36:09.000
Guided will be presented by Stephanie Farland of the CDE. Stephanie, you can now, I guess, change this slide and begin item 20.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:17.000
Stephanie, are you with us? Yes, I am. Sorry. I was just, can you see the item 20 petition for the, can you see the right slide up on your screen?

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:21.000
Not yet. Okay.

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:28.000
We are working on that very quickly. There we go. We got it. We got it. Okay.

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:34.000
Okay.

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:37.000
Okay, so item 20.

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:48.000
John Henry High School is seeking authorization from the State Board of Ed to renew its grade nine through grade 12 charter school within the boundaries of the West Contra Costa Unified School District.

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:56.000
The petitioners previously sought renewal through West Contra Costa Unified and the Contra Costa County Board of Education.

02:36:56.000 --> 02:37:01.000
They were denied by West Contra Costa on December 18th, 2019.

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:12.000
It then went on to the Contra Costa County Board of Education on March 11th, 2020, and the board chose not to act on it.

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:17.000
They then appealed to the State Board on March 25th, 2020.

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:30.000
The California Department of Education recommends that the SBE hold a public hearing to deny the request to renew John Henry High, a grade nine through grade 12 charter school under the oversight of the SBE.

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:46.000
The Advisory Commission considered the appeal at their June 9th, 2020 meeting, and they moved to approve the John Henry High School renewal petition by a vote of seven to two.

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:55.000
The basis for recommendation of denial is the petitioner is significantly, is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the intended program.

02:37:55.000 --> 02:38:05.000
They have significant declines in academic progress of their English learner pupils and admission requirements and enrollment process prohibit the school from reaching demographics reflective of West Contra Costa Unified.

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:13.000
And the petition does not provide reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all required 15 charter elements.

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:25.000
A little background on the school. Their mission is to provide a rigorous college preparatory education and character development program that will prepare students from underserved communities to succeed in college and beyond.

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:35.000
Their people population population primarily comes from Richmond and San Pablo, and consists of predominantly low income and immigrant students.

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:53.000
They are operated by a method public schools, a California nonprofit benefit corporation amps, as it's known is current currently operates three schools in Alameda County and three schools in Contra Costa County.

02:38:53.000 --> 02:39:06.000
Academic criteria under 476071 was the author is the authority that granted the charter shall consider increases in pupil academic achievement for all groups of pupils served by the charter school as the most important factor.

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:19.000
The entity that granted the charter determines that the academic performance of the charter school is at least equal to the academic performance of the public schools at the other, but the charter school pupils would otherwise have been required to attend.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:33.000
The population that is served under John Henry High is 95% Latino and 91% socioeconomically disadvantaged.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:48.000
So here are cast results for John Henry High as compared to the other high schools in West Contra Costa Unified School District.

02:39:48.000 --> 02:40:17.000
As you can see, they have met our threshold criteria for academic renewal, the academic renewal criteria, and you can see that there there's been some variation over the years and they've definitely have gone down in their math scores significantly from two or three years ago.

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:26.000
Here are cast results by people subgroup for socioeconomically disadvantaged peoples is that is their largest subgroup.

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:39.000
And again, some significant declines in their math scores their ELA goes back and forth but from the last couple years is on the rise.

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:48.000
We did look at alternative measures as allowed under section Ed code section 52052.

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:55.000
And one of the things that we looked at that they provided us where their increase in advanced placement course offerings.

02:40:55.000 --> 02:41:02.000
They did increase to five offerings in 2018 19.

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:09.000
We've included some of the dashboard colors on here for you to see.

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:19.000
This is from the 2019 California school dashboard and you can see their yellow for ELA and orange for math.

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:25.000
Here are some of the subgroup totals.

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:32.000
English learners are an orange socioeconomically disadvantaged yellow and Latino Hispanic green.

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:36.000
No in blue.

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:42.000
Some more specifics in terms of the dashboard and English learners.

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:59.000
They are in orange for the English learners as a subgroup and in red for math as a subgroup with significant declines in math and small decline in English learners for ELA.

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:14.000
Ability to implement in terms of their budget, as I mentioned earlier, we did look at the original budget that they had submitted and according to the original budget, they

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:18.000
they seem to be fiscally viable.

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:24.000
It looked different for the ACCS because we were basing that one on May revise, which is no longer in effect.

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:27.000
And under that budget, they were not fiscally viable.

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:35.000
So we went back to their original budget and they are with the appropriate reserves.

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:40.000
We are not looking at this in terms because they are already they are an established school.

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:43.000
So we will we were not looking at it.

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:47.000
We did not have time to look at it in terms of deferrals, but that really is a question.

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:59.000
Hopefully that we can have the school itself answer in terms of how they plan to deal with the deferrals that will be coming to them and how they're going to do that.

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:04.000
And so that's something that they can they can discuss during their their time.

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:12.000
There were insufficient descriptions of many of the charter elements that are listed there.

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:19.000
Employee qualifications, they do not specifically identify which positions they regard as key in each category.

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:33.000
They do not identify the general qualifications of all their positions, including the general qualifications of their non-certificated staff and the petition does not contain job descriptions for for any of the positions.

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:38.000
Element seven, racial and ethnic balance.

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:52.000
You can see by the slide on the screen that their demographic data does not is not reflective of the West Contra Costa Unified School District.

02:43:52.000 --> 02:44:00.000
And this has this was an important point for us when we were reviewing their petition and their data.

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:11.000
Concept of choices is one that is the CDE values and part of that choice includes the ability for all students to enroll in a school when it opens in a district.

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:14.000
Obviously, it's one of the elements.

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:18.000
So it was something that the legislature felt was important to include.

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:23.000
We understand that charters don't always have control over who applies to their school.

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:30.000
However, they do have control over the preferences that they use in terms of their admission requirements.

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:43.000
And part of the issue and the concern that we had with this particular school is they do not reflect the ethnic balance, racial and ethnic balance of of West Contra Costa.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:52.000
You can see they don't reflect them in their English learners or special education or their African-American population.

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:59.000
And we feel that the preferences they've put in place and these were not I don't believe in place in their first petition.

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:12.000
So these are preferences that they're putting in place for this petition will really limit any new students from outside their pool of the Amps organization from from from getting into the school.

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:17.000
You can see that residents of West Contra Costa is number five on their preference list.

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
Their first preference is siblings.

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:26.000
Their second preference are pupils who are already enrolled in another Amps charter school.

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:31.000
Then you go to pupils of founding families and then you go to children of Amps teachers and staff.

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:41.000
And then you finally get to all of the other kids in the district and then all the other pupils obviously in the state because their charters are open to everyone.

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:56.000
And so we did have a very a very big concern about whether or not they were open to expanding the types of kids they enroll in their school.

02:45:56.000 --> 02:46:06.000
There was nothing in their petition that specifically addressed the issue of of expanding enrollment in their school to kids outside of their organization.

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:10.000
And so that was an issue for us.

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
Suspension and expulsion procedures.

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:22.000
The petition does not present a reasonably comprehensive description of suspension and expulsion procedures in terms of placement of pupils in an interim alternative education setting.

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:29.000
The family handbook contains language that could be interpreted as an additional offense for expulsion that is not listed in the petition.

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:39.000
And that is that in the handbook, they talk about their student attendance review board and some of the issues that they take on.

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:53.000
And one of the things they state is that students can be dismissed possibly from the school, from Amps and or referred to the DA for student attendance issues.

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:56.000
And that was an issue because really students should not be dismissed.

02:46:56.000 --> 02:47:01.000
The only way students should be dismissed is if they voluntarily disenroll or if they're expelled.

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:17.000
So there was some language discrepancies between what was in the petition and what is currently in their handbook that we had some concerns with charter elements 11 and 14 retirement coverage.

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:23.000
The petition does not specify who will be responsible for ensuring that appropriate arrangements for their employees retirement have been made.

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:30.000
And the dispute resolution procedures did not include a reasonably comprehensive description of this charter element.

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:35.000
So the CDE recommends that the SBE deny the petition to establish John Henry High School.

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:46.000
The petitioner is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the intended program and the petition does not provide reasonably reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all required elements.

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:49.000
Oops, I'm going to not do that one yet. Okay.

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
And that's the conclusion.

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:55.000
President Bradley-Hammond.

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
Thank you very much.

02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:04.000
At this point, we will hear, I hereby open the public hearing at 1227 p.m.

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
And we will hear first from the petitioners.

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:14.000
They will have 12 minutes and we'll hear from the district and county that are opposing the renewal petition or at least in this case the district.

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:17.000
They will also have a total of 12 minutes.

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:26.000
After the presentations from both sides, there will then be an opportunity for public comment from any individual who has not already presented for one minute each.

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:29.000
So we'll take the practitioner presentation.

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:40.000
Hi, let me share my screen here.

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:59.000
Okay, thank you.

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:05.000
Good afternoon. My name is Sylvia Flores and I'm the site director at John Henry High School.

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:15.000
John Henry opened its doors in 2015 and we're a small school serving a total student population of 315 students in grades 9 through 12.

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:25.000
As a small school, we're able to create a community where all members of our school, we know each other by name, we are able to care for one another and support one another.

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:30.000
As you can see, 91% of our students are socioeconomically disadvantaged.

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:36.000
21% are English learners and 8% are receiving special education services.

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:46.000
Since we opened the school in 2015, we've seen a consistently growing waiting list of hopeful families looking to enroll at our school.

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:57.000
This past year for the 2020-2021 school year, we have the largest waitlist we've ever seen with over 300 applications for this upcoming school year.

02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:02.000
So John Henry High School is one of the most coveted schools in the city.

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:22.000
This slide shows you we broke down based on current families addresses. We see that over 90% of our students would be required to enroll at Kennedy, Richmond High, or De Anza, with the majority of our students being assigned to Kennedy High School based on their home address.

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:32.000
As you notice in this next slide, John Henry is outperforming their peers at all three of these high schools on the CASP ELA ESPAC exam.

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:47.000
68% of our students are meeting or exceeding standards in English, and as mentioned, our English scores have increased annually over all the testing years that have taken place since our founding.

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:59.000
This next slide shows you the math comparisons for the ESPAC exam. Once again, you can see that John Henry is outperforming all high schools that our students would otherwise be required to attend.

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:10.000
We know that we have room for improvements. We don't like this 21%, so we have invested in new curriculum and restructured the way that we support math instruction.

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:26.000
Now, the ESPAC only shows you one year of student data, but as the data-driven school, this is our PSAT data, which is growth data for this past senior year class, so the class of 2020.

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:41.000
This cohort of students has taken or took the PSAT over three consecutive years, and I'm proud to report that the class of 2020 did increase their scores by 188 points during their time with us at John Henry High School.

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:52.000
We see improvements in both English and math, and the increase can be attributed to our targeted support and intervention programs such as learning lab, interim assessments.

02:51:52.000 --> 02:52:04.000
So we are seeing growth, and I'm going to show you in terms of advanced placement, we have increased AP participation by 300% over the past few years.

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:15.000
The AP course offerings, as you saw in the CDE presentation, we weren't offering anything in the first few years because we only had ninth and tenth graders.

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:29.000
So as we added more classes, we began offering more AP courses, and now we're offering math, English, foreign language, and we're planning to add science and other electives in the next few years.

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:41.000
So as you can see here, our AP passing rate grew from 12% to 40% between one year to the next.

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:49.000
Now I do want to address some of the concerns that were raised in the CDE staff report, beginning with recruitment.

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:57.000
Our entire community, the John Henry community, is committed to achieving the demographic distribution that is reflective of our district.

02:52:57.000 --> 02:53:03.000
Students are accepted through a randomized lottery, which is operated by a third party called Enroll West Contra Costa.

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:12.000
We partnered with them three years ago, and we've seen progress already. So over the years, our lottery numbers have grown exponentially.

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:21.000
For this upcoming year, we received 231 applications for only 90 spots for the incoming ninth grade class.

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:34.000
So in order to reach the demographics that resemble those of West Contra Costa, we plan to improve our recruitment and outreach efforts and diversify our applicant pool.

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:43.000
So we plan to target middle schools, both district and charter, who have large numbers of English language learners, SPED students, African American students.

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:58.000
And we want to collaborate with the leadership teams at those schools to do annual events where we can make sure that families are aware of the opportunities, enrichment, and we want to help them with the enrollment process.

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:17.000
We are also planning to hire a consultant who will be interviewing and surveying African American students, SPED, and EL families to provide recommendations for improving both the cultural responsiveness of our educational program, but also our recruitment and outreach efforts.

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:37.000
Now that West Contra Costa is breaking up into five district boundaries, we have security partnership with KDI Charter Zone, which we're going to be able to use a GPS demographic tool that captures school age populations and breaks it up into free and reduced lunch,

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:58.000
ethnicities, language status in order for us to identify areas to target. And we have also established family captains within our schools so that we can target those areas and host like block parties or right now virtual block meetings to distribute recruitment materials and answer questions.

02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:06.000
We don't only want to diversify John Henry, but also our other elementary and middle school here in Richmond.

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:18.000
Moving on to English learners, we have seen success. John Henry is succeeding in terms of English, our English learner program and looking through the California dashboard data.

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:29.000
John Henry has the highest percentage of English language learners making progress towards proficiency in the entire district at a rate of 56.3%.

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:34.000
This is the highest rate of any school traditional or charter in our district.

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:42.000
Our students do receive designated and integrated EL instruction that is aligned to the California ELD standards.

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:51.000
This next graph shows you, this is our total student body broken down by English language proficiency.

02:55:51.000 --> 02:56:01.000
As you can see, 21.5% of our student body is classified as English learners. This is for this year that just passed.

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:08.000
So 1920, 71% of our students were English learners and have been reclassified.

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:17.000
So in total, 92% of our total student body have been classified as English learners at some point in their educational trajectory.

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:30.000
And 71% have been reclassified in that trajectory. In terms of our LPAC proficiency levels, 50% of our current English learners are in levels one and two.

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:35.000
We saw a huge influx of newcomers into our school this past year.

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:44.000
So we have been able to provide the support and the rigorous instruction that they need in order to succeed.

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:54.000
I'm going to transition into math. This past year we adopted CPM, which is college preparatory math, as our new math curriculum.

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:59.000
As I told you before, we're not happy with that 21%. We want to improve.

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:05.000
And we have increased professional development opportunities for our math teachers and our support staff.

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:14.000
We also hired paraprofessional tutors in order to be in every algebra one section along with the credential teacher.

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:21.000
This past year, our geometry and algebra two classes had no more than 20 students per section.

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:33.000
And this has proven effective in increasing students conceptual understanding of math, which is one of the things that we noticed in the summer that was that was an area of concern.

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:42.000
I'm going to turn it over to Mike Barr, who is going to be talking about the revised financial projections for our school.

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:49.000
Hi, good afternoon. As discussed by the CD earlier, our financials are solid. There's two sets of numbers on the slide.

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:53.000
The numbers at the top reflect what we shared with the ACCS last month.

02:57:53.000 --> 02:58:00.000
Those were based on the governor's May revision, which had a much lower funding scenario than what we currently know.

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:05.000
The bottom set of numbers reflect the latest guidance we got from Sacramento. We've done a couple things conservatively.

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:09.000
We've assumed that enrollment is only two hundred eighty kids next year.

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:14.000
We think it's going to be higher than that based on wait list and based on the excitement around the school.

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:20.000
We've also conservatively assumed that we do not benefit from any that hold harmless calculations that are made.

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:27.000
In other words, we'd assume that if we have two hundred eighty kids next year, that's what we'll get funded on because we feel that's more conservative.

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:34.000
There's a slide that talks about how we're going to mitigate through the external internal factors that will affect our abilities to be successful,

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:39.000
knowing that this is a multi-year economic crisis that we need to navigate through.

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:46.000
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Janelle from Young Mini Core and then we'll come back to Sylvia.

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:50.000
Thank you. And good afternoon, board members, Janelle Rooley with Young Mini and Core.

02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:59.000
I want to highlight for you again that even the CDE found that John Henry's academic program meets the renewal criteria and provides a sound educational program.

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:06.000
As to the other points that CDE raised, the staff report suggested that these are fairly easily remedied with amendments to the charter.

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:15.000
When it comes to governance, there was a question about the meeting location, but the charter school has complied with new law and will agree to a condition on employee qualifications.

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:20.000
They really just need to add the word key and move qualifications from the appendix into the charter.

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:23.000
We heard about racial and ethnic balance on admission.

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:29.000
The charter school is willing to work with the CDE to reorder those preferences on suspension expulsion.

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:31.000
They're already complying with the law.

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:41.000
And I would add that the law was changed in twenty eighteen to allow for involuntary removal as an additional reason that a student may be removed from the school on retirement.

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:46.000
On retirement, they just need to identify who the person is responsible for ensuring arrangements are made.

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:50.000
And on dispute resolution, we couldn't have made those changes because no changes can be made to the charter.

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:53.000
But the charter school promised to make those changes.

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:59.000
So ultimately, these things do not rise to the level of closing a nationally recognized charter school.

02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:03.000
John Henry was named a twenty twenty best high school by US News and Mobile Port.

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:09.000
They certainly don't rise to the level of closing a school that outperforms all of the schools that students would otherwise attend.

03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:11.000
The law simply does not permit this closure.

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:13.000
And I'll go back to Ms. Flores.

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:14.000
Thank you.

03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:25.000
In terms of our distance learning plan, we're proud to share that 92 percent of our students were engaged in daily assignments during last semester's distance learning model.

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:36.000
So we are working with the community and stakeholders to be able to continue that rigorous instruction and learning for every student that is at our school.

03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:43.000
We are college prep. We've sent over 90 percent of our graduating seniors to four year colleges since we were founded.

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:50.000
And you can see some other stats here in terms of highlights.

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:54.000
We are the third best high school in West Contra Costa.

03:00:54.000 --> 03:01:00.000
So we ask that you go to our school. Thank you.

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:09.000
Thank you very much. And at this point, we'll move to the district presenters potentially with the county.

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:17.000
I don't know.

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:22.000
The district. There we go.

03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:27.000
All right. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for hearing our appeal.

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:31.000
I would like to thank you all also for your work. My name is Dr.

03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:38.000
Linda Delgado. I performed charters charter school oversight for the district of West Contra Costa.

03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:47.000
And I will be joined as needed in this presentation with the folks listed below.

03:01:47.000 --> 03:02:07.000
The school found the school findings for West Contra against John Henry include that there is an inadequate English language development and special education programs and the method organization provides inadequate governance and management.

03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:15.000
Background preliminarily test scores are considered the most important factor in reviewing a charter petition.

03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:22.000
Test scores are impacted, however, by student populations who traditionally underperform on the cast.

03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:31.000
For example, English language learner percentages impact test results as the test is not in the students primary language.

03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:37.000
Test score comparisons are legitimate only when student populations subgroups are similar.

03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:47.000
The claim of equal to or better than district schools cannot factually be made in a review of the data will make this clear.

03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:55.000
Subgroups include English language learners, special education, foster and homeless youth and students living in poverty.

03:02:55.000 --> 03:03:03.000
A comparative review of all district high schools and John Henry will follow.

03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:06.000
In this table, you'll find highlighted.

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:12.000
John Henry is in the yellow first column, followed by all district high schools.

03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:19.000
Each school's data is presented in column form and subgroup headings are noted along the left hand axis.

03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:23.000
The highest percentage for each row is bolded and underlined.

03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:31.000
In no case does John Henry lead the schools most frequently used in the petition for comparison are immediately to the right.

03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:37.000
Kennedy and Richmond high schools, and they serve considerably different populations.

03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:42.000
Please note the following rows in particular for English language learners.

03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:48.000
Kennedy and Richmond have greater than three times the EL's for special education.

03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:54.000
All schools with the exception of middle college have higher special education numbers.

03:03:54.000 --> 03:04:00.000
Kennedy and Richmond serve the greatest numbers of socioeconomically disadvantaged students.

03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:04.000
John Henry is not serving a representative population.

03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:11.000
And further, the organization has changed the lottery to further cement this disparity.

03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:22.000
On this slide, the left hand column compares the district and John Henry for EL percentages over a four year period, illustrating disparity in percentages.

03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:25.000
And there is a dramatically falling trend line.

03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:30.000
The district average is orange and John Henry is gray.

03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:37.000
The table on the right shows the overall school percentage of EL's in the first data column.

03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:45.000
The second data column has the percentage of that group who are English language learners levels one and two.

03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:57.000
For example, at John Henry, the overall percentage during the years of evaluation was 12.5 of the total population.

03:04:57.000 --> 03:05:05.000
And of that 12.5, 23.8, about a quarter, are levels one and two.

03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:18.000
Contrasted with Richmond High with an overall percentage of 39, basically 40%, and half of that group were EL's one and two.

03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:21.000
Now we'll go on to the program itself.

03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:24.000
Staffing and scheduling issues.

03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:35.000
Over the 2019-20 year, five different teachers were, one after the other, tasked with leading the school's single ELD course.

03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:46.000
During this class period, each teacher attempted to provide instruction for four grade levels, four EL levels, and four language domains in one classroom.

03:05:46.000 --> 03:05:50.000
The petition was silent on how this might be achieved.

03:05:50.000 --> 03:05:53.000
There was a failure to provide adequate curriculum.

03:05:53.000 --> 03:06:03.000
Although the organization stated that ELD curriculum was in place from inception, the board did not adopt curriculum until this last academic year.

03:06:03.000 --> 03:06:10.000
The reclassification process was just recently drafted and put into place in the school's fifth year.

03:06:10.000 --> 03:06:14.000
We don't know what it contains or if it is effective.

03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:21.000
The performance gap from the dashboard focusing on statewide data.

03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:29.000
To demonstrate the effect of subgroup membership on CASP scores, a review of statewide data is provided.

03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:37.000
The first row shows percentages of students at or above grade level for English-only and fluent English speakers.

03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:40.000
This would be students with a firm command of English.

03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:45.000
The second row shows ELL students at or above grade level.

03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:50.000
Obviously, you've got English language arts on the left and math on the right.

03:06:50.000 --> 03:07:00.000
Data are clear that John Henry is not serving the same student populations as other schools, and this demonstrates why it matters.

03:07:00.000 --> 03:07:06.000
Note, in particular, the gaps which are presented here in red.

03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:12.000
The gaps show the statewide difference between ELLs and those with a command of the language.

03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:20.000
The gap between the two groups is significant, illustrating the effect of ELL designation on test scores.

03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:25.000
Greater numbers of ELL students have a greater impact on scores overall.

03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:31.000
John Henry has fewer ELLs than most district schools, and scores are less impacted.

03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:41.000
Next, a comparison of these statewide performance data differences versus the John Henry gap.

03:07:41.000 --> 03:07:44.000
Performance gaps.

03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:53.000
The first row brings the statewide difference in scores between ELLs and fluent English students only from the prior slide.

03:07:53.000 --> 03:07:56.000
That's the 45.68.

03:07:56.000 --> 03:08:00.000
The second row are the same data for John Henry.

03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:05.000
Ideally, that score would be smaller than the statewide gap.

03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:12.000
Rather, it is larger, and the difference is, once again, in red along the bottom.

03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:17.000
Compared with statewide averages, John Henry is underperforming.

03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:28.000
In this review, the presentation has shown that the ELD program has serious and long-term flaws, and this data demonstrates the problem.

03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:35.000
Now onto special education issues.

03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:44.000
This table compares district and John Henry enrollment percentages for special education from 2015 through 2020.

03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:54.000
Over the five years of operation, John Henry has served significantly fewer special ed students and has never served a student with moderate or severe needs.

03:08:54.000 --> 03:09:03.000
There are no CASP data that are publicly available for SPED students throughout the five years of operation because the numbers have always been too low.

03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:12.000
The district requested that John Henry share the data in their possession, and they refused.

03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:17.000
This is an adequate special education program per former staff and leadership.

03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:28.000
Two former A-Method site leaders with extensive special education experience submitted whistleblower complaints detailing faulty special education provision.

03:09:28.000 --> 03:09:39.000
Five teachers from the school submitted statements with concerns about special education program and organizational leadership, and quotes are provided in the appendix.

03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:50.000
Four teachers reported receiving direction from leadership to change grades for special education students to report that they were passing when in fact they were not.

03:09:50.000 --> 03:09:56.000
And three teachers reported direction to mark a student present who had not attended class.

03:09:56.000 --> 03:10:01.000
Additionally, the school failed to provide the required minutes to a number of students.

03:10:02.000 --> 03:10:20.000
They were noticed for that, and they did make up the minutes, but they made them up in the last two or three minutes of each class period, raising serious questions as to the seriousness of the organization's focus on special education students.

03:10:20.000 --> 03:10:25.000
Inadequate special education per community benefit organization.

03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:40.000
In 2019, the district received a letter from the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, an advocacy rights organization funded by the US Department of Education that supports parents of students with disabilities.

03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:58.000
That letter stated Amps administration violated the law by directing special education and site leadership to hold SST meetings in lieu of parent requested assessments to determine whether or not a child needed services in violation of the law and leadership

03:10:58.000 --> 03:11:04.000
directed families to return to the district for accommodations services.

03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:25.000
The charter petition references obligatory child find procedures, however, it does not explicitly reference RTI response to intervention as a fundamental aspect of child find, meaning a child may go through the whole ILP individualized learning program or RTI response to

03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:36.000
intervention process and the site director may deem them unqualified for an SST, creating further barriers to specialized academic instruction.

03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:45.000
The petition stated process could take an entire year for a child to receive services.

03:11:45.000 --> 03:12:00.000
In order to review data illustrating the gap between those in special ed again and those who are not, staff looked at statewide data to try and get a sense of what the impact on test scores might be.

03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:04.000
And here you have once again presented the gap in red.

03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:21.000
Of course, the higher the special ed population served, the greater the impact on scores overall. All other district schools have higher percentages of special education except middle college high, and all see the expected impact on scores.

03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:31.000
This data challenges the legitimacy of the school's data by demonstrating the impact of equivalent special ed enrollment.

03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:51.000
Governance issues. Since 2015 the Method central office has lost at least 20 individuals out of 20 central office leaders, six special education directors two directors of talent, director of IT, the COO, the CAO, the COF, three regional

03:12:51.000 --> 03:13:14.000
superintendents, directors of finance systems and assorted others. Seven central office staff were laid off or fired in June of 2020. That included two regional superintendents, two out of two compliance coordinators, talent communications, special ed coordinators, director of finance and accounting.

03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:32.000
Since 2015 the organization has lost 28 site leaders, including deans and directors. Of these four were from John Henry, six from RCA, and six from BJE, those are the two other Method schools in West Contra Costa.

03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:39.000
John Henry lost 13 teachers and two front office staff between 2016 and 18.

03:13:40.000 --> 03:13:42.000
Sorry.

03:13:42.000 --> 03:13:43.000
Time is up.

03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:49.000
Okay, would you like me to stop or shall I press on.

03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:53.000
Time, you should finish your sentence yeah.

03:13:53.000 --> 03:14:03.000
Basically we're seeing a great deal of turnover there are two more slides but you do have them in your deck. Thank you very much.

03:14:03.000 --> 03:14:05.000
Thank you very much.

03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:11.000
At this point, we want to put up the public comments slide.

03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:26.000
And we want to open the phone line for public comment. We hope that people who were trying to speak earlier have returned to speak at the proper time, members of the public wishing to provide comment on this item.

03:14:26.000 --> 03:14:31.000
I wonder if we can remove that.

03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:52.000
Can you remove that thing from the computer great can call 712-432-0075 enter access code 651905 pound wait for the operator prompts to press star six, and then another prompt to press one to enter the queue.

03:14:52.000 --> 03:14:57.000
And could we have the translator read the instructions in Spanish, please.

03:14:57.000 --> 03:14:59.000
Absolutely.

03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:16.000
For the public hearing, the issue number 20, the phone number is 712-432-0075 will ask for an access number which is 651905 number.

03:15:16.000 --> 03:15:23.000
Escucha el mensaje y cuando se le indique oprima asterisco 6, y cuando se le indique nuevamente oprima 1.

03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:31.000
Cuando sea su turno, un operador le pedirá en inglés que diga su nombre y su afiliación y comience su intervención.

03:15:31.000 --> 03:15:34.000
Su turno empieza ya.

03:15:34.000 --> 03:15:42.000
Dígale, mi nombre es Raya, represento a Raya y necesito un traductor.

03:15:42.000 --> 03:15:44.000
Thank you very much.

03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:48.000
We encourage you to please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:15:48.000 --> 03:15:57.000
Remember to turn down the volume on your computers if you are following the live feed and speakers are limited to one minute each.

03:15:57.000 --> 03:15:59.000
Let's see if we have public comment.

03:15:59.000 --> 03:16:06.000
Speakers on the line, please ensure that this is only for item 20 for John Henry.

03:16:06.000 --> 03:16:14.000
If you're on the line for another item, we ask that you please hang up at this time and call back at the next item.

03:16:14.000 --> 03:16:23.000
Again, only speakers for item 20 John Henry should be in the queue at this time.

03:16:23.000 --> 03:16:29.000
All other callers should hang up at this time and call back at your scheduled item.

03:16:29.000 --> 03:16:40.000
Thank you.

03:16:40.000 --> 03:16:47.000
We have approximately 30 public commenters in the queue, so we will start with our first caller right now.

03:16:47.000 --> 03:16:52.000
Caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record to provide public comment for John Henry High.

03:16:52.000 --> 03:16:57.000
Your time starts now.

03:16:57.000 --> 03:17:01.000
My name is Emma Urbach. Can you hear me?

03:17:01.000 --> 03:17:03.000
Yes.

03:17:03.000 --> 03:17:06.000
Okay, I am the executive director for United Teachers of Richmond.

03:17:06.000 --> 03:17:13.000
I'm asking that you deny the renewal of John Henry High because the school does not have qualified staff at key levels to ensure student success.

03:17:13.000 --> 03:17:21.000
A message John Henry's parent organization recently fired or laid off their Richmond regional superintendent, Richmond regional compliance coordinator, and special education director.

03:17:21.000 --> 03:17:29.000
Additionally, the current John Henry site director, Silvia Flores, has never taught, has a 30-day substitute permit, and does not have an admin credential.

03:17:29.000 --> 03:17:35.000
Natalie Garcia, the John Henry dean of instruction, does not appear to have an administrative credential or clear credential either.

03:17:35.000 --> 03:17:43.000
John Henry is currently recruiting for 10 teaching positions, and it is not clear from the posting that a credential is required despite new state law.

03:17:43.000 --> 03:17:50.000
John Henry averages only 6% retention of teachers, and the majority of teachers who work there do not have clear credentials.

03:17:50.000 --> 03:17:57.000
John Henry and their parent organization do not have the necessary staff, credentialing, or expertise to successfully educate students this fall.

03:17:58.000 --> 03:18:06.000
WCCUSD teachers are ready and willing to welcome students back into the district schools this fall, where they will be taught by qualified teachers with credentials.

03:18:06.000 --> 03:18:09.000
Thank you.

03:18:09.000 --> 03:18:14.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record to provide public comment for John Henry High.

03:18:14.000 --> 03:18:21.000
Your time starts now.

03:18:21.000 --> 03:18:28.000
Hi, I'm Joseph Glatzer, a teacher in the West Contra Costa Unified School District, and I'm asking that you deny John Henry High School's appeal.

03:18:28.000 --> 03:18:40.000
We have many great opportunities in our district and would welcome John Henry students back with open arms, including with AP courses, visual and performing arts opportunities, sports, exciting electives, academies, and more.

03:18:40.000 --> 03:18:46.000
So the demographic makeup of John Henry is not reflective of the community with 95% Latinx.

03:18:46.000 --> 03:18:53.000
They have a lower number of special ed English learners, homeless foster youth, and African American students compared to public district schools.

03:18:53.000 --> 03:18:58.000
So comparing their test scores with those of our district schools is comparing apples and oranges.

03:18:58.000 --> 03:19:05.000
In the 1920 school year, there was only one ELD class which had five different teachers, and there is a lack of progress for English learners overall.

03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:11.000
It is an unstable learning environment. There is a largely large yearly turnover of teachers and administration.

03:19:11.000 --> 03:19:18.000
Despite having many opportunities to fix these issues, they have not. They do not need more chances. Please deny their appeal.

03:19:18.000 --> 03:19:21.000
Thank you.

03:19:21.000 --> 03:19:30.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record to provide public comment for John Henry. Your time starts now.

03:19:31.000 --> 03:19:40.000
Hi, my name is Jamie. I'm a parent for one graduating student and one student who's still at John Henry.

03:19:40.000 --> 03:19:46.000
I ask that you leave the school open. You want to give children of color a better education. John Henry is doing that.

03:19:46.000 --> 03:19:53.000
Miss Delgado has given information that is based on the whole organization, not John Henry.

03:19:53.000 --> 03:20:00.000
John Henry's numbers are much lower. Also, Miss Delgado should be disqualified for the way she has treated John Henry.

03:20:00.000 --> 03:20:06.000
She's given data that she did not get from John Henry. She never visited the school.

03:20:06.000 --> 03:20:15.000
This school has given my children a better education than any of the public schools have in Richmond, and I know because I moved them from public schools.

03:20:15.000 --> 03:20:20.000
Public schools here in Richmond do not give safe environments for our children.

03:20:20.000 --> 03:20:30.000
John Henry has done nothing but provide safe environment and a loving family environment that lets and helps children succeed.

03:20:30.000 --> 03:20:42.000
They really live by their motto, honor hard work. Please, please approve this school. We need them. Thank you.

03:20:42.000 --> 03:20:49.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record to provide public comment for John Henry. Your time starts now.

03:20:49.000 --> 03:20:59.000
Hi, my name is Beashers Burden. I actually have a sister who goes to the school. I am calling in to please ask you guys to give them another chance.

03:20:59.000 --> 03:21:12.000
All the schools we have in the area are already overcrowded as it is, and we would really appreciate having a school in our color community that actually provides them a good education

03:21:12.000 --> 03:21:20.000
and is not just overcrowded and doesn't have the attention that the students need both for their mental health and for their education.

03:21:20.000 --> 03:21:26.000
So I just ask you guys to please sync with your hearts when you vote for this today. Thank you for your time.

03:21:26.000 --> 03:21:37.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record to provide public comment for John Henry. Your time starts now.

03:21:37.000 --> 03:21:45.000
Hi, my name is Gabriela Rodriguez. I am a founding parent and a community member. I am an afternoon board member.

03:21:45.000 --> 03:21:52.000
I would like to express my support for John Henry High School. John Henry is one of the top performing high schools in the West Country process.

03:21:52.000 --> 03:21:58.000
I don't understand why this school is being penalized for serving our Latino community.

03:21:58.000 --> 03:22:03.000
Our students have achieved so much with the high level of academics offered at John Henry.

03:22:03.000 --> 03:22:08.000
They offer a safe environment for our students and promote a pathway for college.

03:22:08.000 --> 03:22:19.000
It is very disturbing for our families and community to hear that UTR, the Teachers Union, sent out a message, message request to its members to vote against John Henry,

03:22:19.000 --> 03:22:31.000
but it does not encourage its members to close the learning gap our district schools have. Please keep John Henry open.

03:22:31.000 --> 03:22:42.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record to provide public comment for John Henry. Your time starts now.

03:22:42.000 --> 03:22:50.000
Good afternoon. My name is Philip Ellingberg. I'm speaking on behalf of ministers in Richmond. I'm a pastor in the city of Richmond.

03:22:50.000 --> 03:23:01.000
And I'd like to speak on behalf of not only our congregation, but my colleagues and at least 40 parishioners.

03:23:01.000 --> 03:23:09.000
We have at least five African-American students who are on the list on the waiting list for John Henry, and we'd love to have them there.

03:23:09.000 --> 03:23:19.000
I've worked extensively with the school in our area, which is Kennedy High, and our students are traumatized from the gang violence as well as the heavy drug presence.

03:23:19.000 --> 03:23:25.000
And we wrestle with how best to educate our children. Some thrive in these own schools, but it's not true for every child.

03:23:25.000 --> 03:23:33.000
I work again with several of these students who are going through heavy trauma, and I ask that we please renew John Henry. Don't take that choice away.

03:23:33.000 --> 03:23:41.000
Parents should have the ability to choose what works best for their child, and once economic situations should not be a bar to exercising that choice.

03:23:41.000 --> 03:23:51.000
The bottom line is this, in my opinion, I thank you so much. Please renew John Henry.

03:23:51.000 --> 03:24:00.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record to provide public comment for John Henry. Your time starts now.

03:24:00.000 --> 03:24:07.000
Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Claudia Lee. I am the site director for Down Charter School in Oakland.

03:24:07.000 --> 03:24:15.000
As a member of the Alms community, I have worked closely with the staff members at John Henry High School for two years now.

03:24:15.000 --> 03:24:20.000
I have witnessed their professionalism, dedication, and commitment to their students.

03:24:20.000 --> 03:24:33.000
I have seen 100% of John Henry High School teachers and administrators and hundreds of parents and students going to meeting after meeting of this long and arduous renewal process.

03:24:33.000 --> 03:24:44.000
Parents and teachers say that they appreciate the learning that is happening in the classrooms and the opportunity that having another high school in Richmond has created for the community.

03:24:44.000 --> 03:24:54.000
I hope that the relentless support and advocacy of hundreds of Richmond Spines means something to you. They just want to choose the school for their children.

03:24:54.000 --> 03:25:00.000
I hope that you grant them the right to choose. Thank you very much.

03:25:09.000 --> 03:25:15.000
Hello, my name is Marissa Glidden. I'm a proud West Contra County educator. Before teaching at West Contra Costa, I was hired to teach at A Method.

03:25:15.000 --> 03:25:19.000
Beginning a teacher orientation, it became clear to me that something was seriously wrong.

03:25:19.000 --> 03:25:31.000
Not only was every teacher uncredentialed at A Method, I was also explicitly taught by the leadership to participate in illegal and problematic disciplinary processes, including making students wear tissue boxes on their feet if they didn't wear shoes and met dress code,

03:25:31.000 --> 03:25:41.000
taking a student's desk away to their floor, sit on the floor, withholding lunch from students who misbehaved and threatening expulsion for minor misbehavior and then dismissing students without official documentation.

03:25:41.000 --> 03:25:51.000
I was also told that A Method encouraged special education students not to apply to the school and purposefully did not recruit students in predominantly African American areas.

03:25:51.000 --> 03:25:57.000
This is what I was explicitly taught by A Method leadership. When I spoke out about these policies, they threatened to fire me.

03:25:57.000 --> 03:26:07.000
After I resigned, Teach for America did their own internal investigation and had the same findings. They now refuse to place teachers at that school. Please protect our students and do not allow John Henry to open. Thank you.

Hi, my name is Kevin Doherty and we work with John Henry High School along with many other schools and youth programs in Contra Costa County.

03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:33.000
I personally have coached the youth in our community and I can recognize valuable influences teachers and institutions can have on them.

03:26:33.000 --> 03:26:43.000
John Henry High School, their teachers, administrators and staff tirelessly work to provide quality opportunities and values for the youth in the community they otherwise would not have.

03:26:43.000 --> 03:26:55.000
So for the sake of our community's future, we cannot afford to let quality, free public schools like John Henry High School be eliminated. Please vote in favor of John Henry High School. Thank you for your time.

03:26:55.000 --> 03:27:01.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record to provide public comment for John Henry. Your time starts now.

03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:15.000
Good morning. Good afternoon board members. My name is Eric Becker and I come to you today to show my support for John Henry High School. I am currently the assistant principal at John Henry Sister School in Oakland.

03:27:15.000 --> 03:27:21.000
I'd like to address the argument that A Method Public Schools is unable to operate a school that successively serves underprivileged communities.

03:27:21.000 --> 03:27:27.000
Oakland Charter High School was established by A Method Public Schools Network in 2007. It is an exemplary school that serves over 85 percent socioeconomically disadvantaged students and 99 percent minority students.

03:27:27.000 --> 03:27:31.000
According to U.S. News and World Report, it is currently the number one high school in Oakland.

03:27:31.000 --> 03:27:37.000
OCHS is also a California Gold Ribbon School and was ranked as high as number four in the state for its API scores.

03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:43.000
Again, this is the sister school of John Henry operated by the same charter management organization that West Contra Costa said is demonstrably unlikely to fulfill its education policy.

03:27:43.000 --> 03:27:49.000
It is a high school that serves over 85 percent socioeconomically disadvantaged students and 99 percent minority students.

03:27:49.000 --> 03:27:57.000
I'm also a parent in West Contra Costa. I have three children in WCCUSD public schools and I would like you to keep John Henry open as an option for them.

03:27:57.000 --> 03:28:03.000
John Henry is outperformed all of the local schools, especially for socioeconomics.

03:28:03.000 --> 03:28:09.000
It is a high school that serves over 85 percent socioeconomically disadvantaged students and 99 percent minority students.

03:28:09.000 --> 03:28:15.000
It is a high school that serves over 85 percent socioeconomics.

03:28:15.000 --> 03:28:19.000
It is a high school that serves over 85 percent socioeconomics.

03:28:19.000 --> 03:28:23.000
It is a high school that serves over 85 percent socioeconomics.

03:28:23.000 --> 03:28:27.000
It is a high school that serves over 85 percent socioeconomics.

03:28:27.000 --> 03:28:31.000
It is a high school that serves over 85 percent socioeconomics.

03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:35.000
It is a high school that serves over 85 percent socioeconomics.

03:28:35.000 --> 03:28:39.000
It is a high school that serves over 85 percent socioeconomics.

03:28:39.000 --> 03:28:41.000
It's time to put students first.

03:28:41.000 --> 03:28:47.000
We have a growth but the dashboard shows we have a percentage of ELL students progressing towards proficiency in the district.

03:28:47.000 --> 03:28:51.000
And 71 percent of our student body are former ELLs we designated as proficient.

03:28:51.000 --> 03:28:55.000
The former G focus does not work under our current leadership.

03:28:55.000 --> 03:28:59.000
He likely does not know that we were granted a letter of good state in the district.

03:28:59.000 --> 03:29:03.000
Old grievances need to be set aside so we can focus on the future.

03:29:03.000 --> 03:29:07.000
Compared our data with statewide averages instead of the local schools that our students would otherwise.

03:29:07.000 --> 03:29:11.000
The only thing kept at local was looking at demographics.

03:29:11.000 --> 03:29:15.000
We do not have a selective admissions process but we are notoriously rigorous.

03:29:15.000 --> 03:29:21.000
And we have students who come to us who buy over 90 percent socioeconomically disadvantaged minority students.

03:29:21.000 --> 03:29:25.000
Low African-American enrollment is a chartered issue not a John Henry specific issue.

03:29:25.000 --> 03:29:29.000
And this blurs the fighting tooth and nail to make us a leader in changing this disturbing trend.

03:29:29.000 --> 03:29:31.000
Thank you.

Hi my name is Mike Parker.

03:29:45.000 --> 03:29:51.000
I'm a retired community college instructor in industrial electronics and a member of the Richmond Workforce Development Board.

03:29:51.000 --> 03:29:59.000
I have long been concerned about the problems in our education system in preparing underserved communities for skills required in our modern economy.

03:29:59.000 --> 03:30:07.000
I and I assume all of you recognize the institutionalized racism in our society and in our school system.

03:30:07.000 --> 03:30:11.000
JHHS is a good example of this institutionalized racism.

03:30:11.000 --> 03:30:17.000
It's part of the re-segregation of our public school system.

03:30:17.000 --> 03:30:25.000
Although the surrounding community is about 25 percent black, JHHS has less than 3 percent black enrollment.

03:30:25.000 --> 03:30:31.000
At the same time, JHHS does a poor job in developing English language learners.

03:30:31.000 --> 03:30:39.000
This segregation denies all of our young people the ability to learn and understand other cultures in the society in which we live.

03:30:39.000 --> 03:30:47.000
I urge you to make rooting out institutionalized racism a priority and deny renewal of the Henry High School.

03:30:47.000 --> 03:30:49.000
Thank you.

Hi my name is Felix Cabrera and I'm the Dean of Instruction at Oakland Starter High School, the sister school of John Henry and the Amps organization.

03:31:07.000 --> 03:31:11.000
I've worked for OCHS for six years, five as a teacher and one as an administrator.

03:31:11.000 --> 03:31:13.000
Just a second here.

03:31:13.000 --> 03:31:15.000
Let me turn that up.

03:31:15.000 --> 03:31:19.000
The public education system is clearly broken in California.

03:31:19.000 --> 03:31:23.000
I've learned this not only in my time working in it as both before I joined Oakland Charter High School,

03:31:23.000 --> 03:31:29.000
but also through my education program that I've gone through as an administrator, as I now have my administrative credential.

03:31:29.000 --> 03:31:31.000
Nowhere is this gap more important.

03:31:31.000 --> 03:31:37.000
We fail to close achievement grants across the state and nowhere is this more apparent than in Contra Costa County and Richmond in particular.

03:31:37.000 --> 03:31:43.000
John Henry shows consistent improvement and growth in both Latinx and socio-economic disadvantaged students.

03:31:43.000 --> 03:31:51.000
More and more families are looking to them as an answer for their educational needs over the failing public schools that resist change at every turn.

03:31:51.000 --> 03:31:59.000
So I highly recommend that you keep John Henry open and allow it to continue to make the improvements that it has been working time and again to make sure it happens.

03:31:59.000 --> 03:32:01.000
Thank you.

I mean, good afternoon.

03:32:12.000 --> 03:32:18.000
My name is Ledza Cuellar and I am a student at John Henry High School who will be a senior next upcoming school year.

03:32:18.000 --> 03:32:21.000
And I have grown in more ways than I can count academically.

03:32:21.000 --> 03:32:26.000
All thanks to John Henry with the aid from my teachers, staff, and my own classmates.

03:32:26.000 --> 03:32:29.000
And I would like to ask you to vote in favor of John Henry High School.

03:32:29.000 --> 03:32:33.000
We have fought and worked so hard for so long to build up our community.

03:32:33.000 --> 03:32:40.000
And I'm sure my fellow classmates have hopes for a future with John Henry as well as please vote in favor of John Henry.

03:32:40.000 --> 03:32:42.000

Un momento, por favor.

03:33:00.000 --> 03:33:02.000
Translators, are you available?

03:33:02.000 --> 03:33:04.000
Right here.

03:33:04.000 --> 03:33:06.000
Okay.

03:33:06.000 --> 03:33:16.000
Okay.

03:33:16.000 --> 03:33:20.000
Good afternoon. My name is Karina Rodriguez and I have my own translator.

03:33:20.000 --> 03:33:29.000
Hello, my name is Karina Rodriguez and I would like the voice of my son and my family to be heard.

03:33:29.000 --> 03:33:36.000
Hi, my name is Karina Rodriguez and I would like my voice and the voice of my son and the voice of my community to be heard once more.

03:33:36.000 --> 03:33:42.000
Mi hijo Angel Lopez estaría comenzando a cursar el ultimo año de la high school.

03:33:42.000 --> 03:33:46.000
My son Angel would be enrolled in his last year of high school this year.

03:33:46.000 --> 03:33:51.000
Esto va a ser posible si ustedes hacen un voto a favor para que la escuela siga abierta.

03:33:51.000 --> 03:33:55.000
And this would be possible if you guys vote for the school to remain open.

03:33:55.000 --> 03:34:01.000
Mi hijo actualmente se encuentra preocupado y yo diría hasta cierto punto un poco deprimido.

03:34:01.000 --> 03:34:04.000
My son finds himself very worried and a bit depressed at times.

03:34:04.000 --> 03:34:10.000
Él es muy activo y con esta pandemia de golpe ha parado todos sus proyectos que tenía para el verano.

03:34:10.000 --> 03:34:15.000
He's a very active kid and with the current pandemic everything has stopped all of a sudden.

03:34:15.000 --> 03:34:18.000
Y ahora lo que más le preocupa es el cierre de la escuela.

03:34:18.000 --> 03:34:22.000
Él se sienta a la deriva sin saber cuál es el siguiente paso.

03:34:23.000 --> 03:34:28.000
But what the things that we're the thing that worries us the most is the closing of the school.

03:34:28.000 --> 03:34:31.000
He feels lost and not being certain about his future.

03:34:36.000 --> 03:34:41.000
We have enrolled him in many public schools but not have not heard anything back from any of them.

03:34:46.000 --> 03:34:50.000
We don't understand why there's so much effort into closing down Henry High School.

03:34:53.000 --> 03:35:01.000
When the school has been shown to surpass this all those competitors in Contra Costa and math and English

03:35:05.000 --> 03:35:09.000
has been named one of the best schools in the country in 2020.

03:35:14.000 --> 03:35:17.000
90 percent of its students get into a four-year college.

03:35:22.000 --> 03:35:25.000
And the advisory commission has remained.

03:35:25.000 --> 03:35:26.000
Thank you.

03:35:37.000 --> 03:35:39.000
Hi I'm Mary Flanagan.

03:35:39.000 --> 03:35:40.000
I'm a retired teacher.

03:35:40.000 --> 03:35:45.000
I taught 14 years at Neistrom Elementary Public School in West Richmond.

03:35:45.000 --> 03:35:51.000
And for a few years John Henry High School was in a temporary portable on the other side of Neistrom.

03:35:51.000 --> 03:35:52.000
The elementary school.

03:35:52.000 --> 03:35:54.000
It was on the same block.

03:35:54.000 --> 03:36:00.000
And John Henry did not have any visibly African-American students or teachers or parents.

03:36:00.000 --> 03:36:06.000
And at that time the kids at Neistrom the elementary school were more than 20 percent African-American.

03:36:06.000 --> 03:36:13.000
And it's a huge insult to our students and their families that John Henry excluded African-American students.

03:36:13.000 --> 03:36:16.000
That segregation is unconstitutional.

03:36:16.000 --> 03:36:19.000
Remember Brown versus Topeka Board of Education.

03:36:19.000 --> 03:36:26.000
And our elementary students had witnessed that racist segregation right on the other side of a cyclone fence every day.

03:36:26.000 --> 03:36:31.000
I urge you do not renew John Henry High School's charter.

03:36:31.000 --> 03:36:35.000
Even now John Henry only has 2.8 percent African-American students.

03:36:35.000 --> 03:36:42.000
And Kennedy High School the nearest public high school is 25 percent African-American enrolled.

03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:44.000
Thank you.

Hi my name is Forest Bori.

03:36:58.000 --> 03:36:59.000
I'm a teacher.

03:36:59.000 --> 03:37:03.000
Well I have been a teacher at John Henry High School for the last two years.

03:37:03.000 --> 03:37:06.000
Right now I just found a job with Berkeley Unified Public Schools.

03:37:06.000 --> 03:37:09.000
Not a transition that I wanted to make.

03:37:09.000 --> 03:37:13.000
I very much wanted to stay with my family at John Henry High School.

03:37:13.000 --> 03:37:14.000
I think that our director Ms.

03:37:14.000 --> 03:37:16.000
Flores is an absolute hero to the community.

03:37:16.000 --> 03:37:24.000
I feel that the biggest problem in the last two years that I've worked at our school has been the constant threats of closure.

03:37:24.000 --> 03:37:26.000
And you want to talk about teacher turnover.

03:37:26.000 --> 03:37:30.000
Well now you're going to have another one with me because I had to find another job this last year.

03:37:30.000 --> 03:37:36.000
But again I would have absolutely loved to have looped two more years with the 10th graders of this year.

03:37:36.000 --> 03:37:46.000
I'm sourly disappointed that nobody from the educational community ever once came into my classroom and got to see the incredibly profound growth that we were making.

03:37:46.000 --> 03:37:58.000
They I am so blown away that people like the other mother had said from our school that people are putting so much energy into shutting this down instead of just asking us what we need and how they can help us.

03:37:58.000 --> 03:38:01.000
They've constantly treated us poorly.

03:38:01.000 --> 03:38:03.000
And this school absolutely deserves to stay open.

03:38:03.000 --> 03:38:07.000
Watch it in five years it'll be absolutely the best school in West Contra Costa.

03:38:07.000 --> 03:38:09.000
Thank you.

Hello my name is Joanna Morales and as a junior at John Henry High School I feel anger.

03:38:24.000 --> 03:38:27.000
Anger a strong feeling of annoyance displeasure or hostility.

03:38:27.000 --> 03:38:30.000
So answer me this who must I blame for this hostility.

03:38:30.000 --> 03:38:35.000
When I'm stuck in a class anxiety rising hostility knowing this isn't healthy for me so why must this be.

03:38:35.000 --> 03:38:37.000
I'll vanish from me my tranquility.

03:38:37.000 --> 03:38:40.000
I'm told not to blame you so please tell me who.

03:38:40.000 --> 03:38:42.000
I must blame for making my worst year come true.

03:38:42.000 --> 03:38:45.000
Look now I'm not just writing a poem I'm trying to get to you.

03:38:45.000 --> 03:38:48.000
For my words that are broken please don't be like a court fool.

03:38:48.000 --> 03:38:51.000
Your nose spreads to me and it kicks my hostility.

03:38:51.000 --> 03:38:54.000
And so you must see I will keep my tranquility.

03:38:55.000 --> 03:38:59.000
I tried so darn hard to do my best and if I got my school I'd give it a rest.

03:38:59.000 --> 03:39:01.000
But sadly that's not guaranteed.

03:39:01.000 --> 03:39:03.000
So here I am to plead.

03:39:03.000 --> 03:39:05.000
Keep my school open. Fight for John Henry.

03:39:05.000 --> 03:39:09.000
Thank you.

My name is Debbie Bayer I'm a Richmond resident and I am calling to ask you not to renew John Henry's application even though I hear that it causes disruption for the children who are currently attending and that does move me.

03:39:41.000 --> 03:40:07.000
But I feel that the sort of segregate the lack of African-American students and the poor performance of disabled students and English learners students, high teacher turnover which happened before the previous two years all make me feel like John Henry,

03:40:07.000 --> 03:40:25.000
The rest of us who pay money into the West County Costa Unified School District budget are subsidizing schools like John Henry who can take the students they want and then go forward with and reach out to the rest of us who are left.

03:40:25.000 --> 03:40:35.000

Good afternoon. My name is Michael Juba and I represent the California Teachers Association.

03:40:45.000 --> 03:40:53.000
DTA recommends that the SBE vote to deny the renewal petition for John Henry high for the following reasons.

03:40:53.000 --> 03:41:15.000
JHH fails to meet the academic requirements for renewal in the Charter Schools Act with significant declines in academic progress of English learners and ELA and math and concerns that the current admission requirements set up an enrollment process that prohibits JHH from reaching demographics that are reflective of West Contra Costa Unified School District.

03:41:15.000 --> 03:41:22.000
Second, their enrollment practices are highly suspect and their governance practices fall short.

03:41:22.000 --> 03:41:35.000
And the CDE also found that the petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of all the required elements for five, seven, eight, 10, 11, and 14.

03:41:35.000 --> 03:41:43.000
So in conclusion, the State Board of Education should deny this renewal position. Thank you.

Hello. Yes, we can hear you. Please provide your public comment.

03:42:01.000 --> 03:42:14.000
Hi, my name is Araceli Magana and I'm a proud mother of two students who are attending John Henry High School. And I really ask you guys to please keep it open. It's been an amazing school. It has helped a lot of my students.

03:42:14.000 --> 03:42:24.000
And that's how I'm hearing a lot of comments. I don't know why they're focusing a lot in races who attend the school. Whoever, everybody's welcome in that school.

03:42:24.000 --> 03:42:36.000
So I just please ask for you guys to please consider and keep our school open, especially now with our distance and kids cannot be overcrowded in other schools. Our Richmond schools are fully packed.

03:42:36.000 --> 03:42:46.000
They won't be able for them to have them separate six feet off students. So please keep our school open. John Henry. Thank you.

03:43:08.000 --> 03:43:23.000
My name is Nigeli Ochoa and I am a John Henry alumni. I graduated in 2019 and I'm currently attending a four-year university. More than 90% of graduates were accepted into four-year universities, looking to pursue higher education.

03:43:23.000 --> 03:43:39.000
And a lot of that is due to the amazing academic resources provided to us at John Henry. It's honestly very devastating that we have to have to fight this hard for a school that has proven themselves numerous times in so many ways that we have the right to remain open.

03:43:39.000 --> 03:43:48.000
This has become such a political thing. Please focus on the fact that so many students and parents chose to be part of the John Henry High School community.

03:43:48.000 --> 03:44:08.000
It's very saddening that we have to keep fighting for our school during this pandemic. We're all frustrated that so many people try so hard to shut us down. Families chose to attend. The choice lies on us. And if so many families are fighting hard to keep the school open, that should tell all board members and board members this is to us. Thank you.

My name is Philip Chung. I reside in the state of Richmond. I'm a teacher at John Henry High School. We are a small school and we emphasize that in giving students and families a choice on where they're educated.

03:44:48.000 --> 03:45:06.000
An example of how we use our small size to better students experience is just two days after the County Board of Education denied or took no action on our appeal.

03:45:06.000 --> 03:45:26.000
We received or that was the last day of in-person instruction on that last day in order to minimize the impact of the digital divide. We did a full eyes on inspection of every student's laptop, power supply and ascertain that they had an internet connection.

03:45:26.000 --> 03:45:39.000
If they did not, we made sure they had that and we maintained their communication with them throughout the instructional period of the school year. Thank you very much.

Hi, I'm my name is Sam Ethan and I'm a teacher and a credit teacher.

03:45:52.000 --> 03:45:57.000
I ask you to approve John Henry and keep us open.

03:45:57.000 --> 03:46:10.000
I would emphasize like many people have been that we are really focused on high achievement. I've seen many of my students really grow and get into four universities and we are a college-bound kind of focus.

03:46:10.000 --> 03:46:21.000
And I also want to mention that many students have been reclassified. A vast majority of my students are ELL students, but they've been reclassified and they're still bilingual.

03:46:21.000 --> 03:46:30.000
Finally, I want to emphasize the ripple effects this closure would have not only on the hundreds of students, but these hundreds of families and the public schools in our area.

03:46:30.000 --> 03:46:42.000
People have mentioned the public schools in their area are many times not safe and at the very least are vastly impacted by the pandemic and budget cuts and are overcrowded.

03:46:42.000 --> 03:46:50.000
So again, I please really urge you to keep our schools open.

Good afternoon. I'm Dr. Sifatib Mukherjee. I am a scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab and a concerned member of the community.

03:47:09.000 --> 03:47:16.000
I ask the school be allowed to continue operations in my capacity as a scientist and educator for over 15 years.

03:47:16.000 --> 03:47:30.000
I've interacted with hundreds of high school students, including those from JHH, and I've observed firsthand how motivated and excited the students are to learn, especially coming from the background that these students are where no one expects these

03:47:30.000 --> 03:47:39.000
teenagers to succeed. It's amazing that what JHH students have achieved over these past years. I mean, just look at their college expectations over the last years. It's phenomenal.

03:47:39.000 --> 03:47:49.000
So I didn't get a chance to look at all of Ms. Flores' slides, but from what I saw briefly, the overall performance far exceeds all the other schools in the area year after year.

I know. Okay. Hi, good afternoon. My name is Cristina Avila, a parent of a 4.5 GPA student. I just want to say that John Henry is one of the best schools in Contra Costa County.

03:48:42.000 --> 03:48:50.000
My daughter is one of the students and I'm proud to say that John Henry is doing an excellent work. The environment in John Henry is very safe.

03:48:50.000 --> 03:48:59.000
You won't see any police watching around or arresting students. John Henry has an excellent discipline. It is a place where I feel confident to leave my daughter every morning.

03:48:59.000 --> 03:49:10.000
It is a place where my daughter feels safe, supportive, and where she can accomplish her goals. Please don't close John Henry. Our students deserve an excellent quality of education as John Henry.

03:49:10.000 --> 03:49:21.000
We don't have too many good options in Richmond. Please take your time to visit our school. Please don't turn your back to our students and keep John Henry open. Thank you.

Good afternoon. My name is Sator Wilson. I'm a teacher in the West Contra Costa School District and I'm opposing the renewal of John Henry High because the school is failing to recruit and retain black students or black teachers.

03:49:40.000 --> 03:49:59.000
During 2016-2017, 90% of the faculty was first or second year teachers. During 2017-2018, 80% of the faculty was replaced. The school is failed to meet the needs of black students, especially students and English language learners. The lack of consistency is damaging to the students of the community. Thank you.

My name is Helen Chang and I'm a teacher in West Contra Costa Unified School District and already I've been working with colleagues to closely to plan for how to make connection with students, especially if we are starting the year distance learning environments.

03:50:27.000 --> 03:50:44.000
The general, when you look at the data that the district has provided, it paints a picture of the governance or an institution that is generally chaotic and with such high staff turnover, it's going to be really hard to meet students' needs.

03:50:44.000 --> 03:51:09.000
In addition, I ask that the board please deny the charter renewal as it creates a situation where the charter serves some students, not all, and any institution that takes public funds needs to serve all students. So I ask again that you please deny the charter's renewal. Thank you.

03:51:09.000 --> 03:51:18.000

This is Katlyn O'Halloran with the Charter Schools Development Center. The Charter Schools Development Center has been a strong supporter of the larger Abe Method Public Schools organization since our deep involvement in its humble beginnings over 25 years ago.

03:51:32.000 --> 03:51:43.000
Since then, AMPS has laid a remarkable track record of launching and operating schools that serve the Bay Area's most challenged populations. John Henry High is its most recent.

03:51:43.000 --> 03:51:56.000
Though John Henry is only in its fifth year and needs to continue to improve to meet AMPS's organization's high standards, it has made significant progress and we believe it will continue to do so.

03:51:56.000 --> 03:52:11.000
We also believe it meets the statutorily mandated standards for charter renewal and that John Henry is a far better alternative for its students than the schools they would otherwise attend. As such, we urge you to grant the appeal to renew the school's charter. Thank you.

Hello there. Can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you.

03:52:29.000 --> 03:52:44.000
Good afternoon. My name is Angelica Zermeno and I'm new to the community of Richmond and I'm also new to the AMPS community. I'm a former math consultant, also worked as a charter authorizer and worked for the WASC oversight committee.

03:52:44.000 --> 03:52:59.000
I wanted to first applaud the board for looking at deconstructing some of the systematic issues that occur in education and I encourage you to look at what's happening now. It seems more political than anything else.

03:52:59.000 --> 03:53:14.000
Maybe you might want to ask the questions of the authorizers if they did their part. Quality authorizers ensure that they support charters and help them improve and all I hear now is just nitpicking so it sounds more political.

03:53:14.000 --> 03:53:26.000
I encourage you to look at quality charters and make sure that we're serving our schools because these kids are learning and I purposely chose to move to the AMPS community because they are fighting for all their students.

03:53:26.000 --> 03:53:33.000
They're not selecting. So I just encourage you to keep it open. So thank you. Take care.

My name is Brett Robbins. I'm calling at the knee of instruction at John Henry High School and I request that you renew the charter for another five-year term. John Henry High School was founded by parents and community members looking for a dependable pathway to college and opportunity for Richmond students.

03:54:00.000 --> 03:54:10.000
A pathway that didn't exist for students in this district prior to the school's founding. Since opening, John Henry High School has produced a four-year college acceptance rate above 90% each year.

03:54:11.000 --> 03:54:21.000
The schools that its students would otherwise attend by large margins in English, math, EL, progress towards proficiency and by even wider margins when you look at the most vulnerable subgroups.

03:54:21.000 --> 03:54:33.000
These academic proficiency and college acceptance data must be prioritized in making this recommendation. The Black and Brown families of West Contra Costa have been denied a viable pathway to empowerment for far too long.

03:54:33.000 --> 03:54:42.000
These communities have been disproportionately impacted during COVID and this is not an appropriate time to shut down their college preparatory high school that they've built in Richmond. Thank you.

I'm Ramel Anton from the California Charter Schools Association speaking in support of John Henry High School. I want to re-focus the conversation to what is actually required by law and that is that economics be the most important factor in determining the renewal of a school with John Henry according to the CDE's report.

03:55:13.000 --> 03:55:29.000
I want to point out that CCSA strongly stands behind quality authorization which we believe West Contra Costa has not offered. The first time that the school has been hearing about these pieces of feedback has come in this process.

03:55:29.000 --> 03:55:40.000
We believe that if these were issues before hand there should be a healthy conversation between the school and their authorizer and this should not be the time to hold schools accountable.

03:55:40.000 --> 03:55:50.000
I ask that you listen to the students that have offered their feelings about their school and how much they need their school. And the last thing I want to talk about is the population growth over time.

03:55:50.000 --> 03:56:02.000
The numbers that have been presented are not static in terms of John Henry's population that they've made meaningful growth in all of the demographics that matter. Please support John Henry. Thank you.

Good afternoon to the board. My name is Edward Sklar and I serve as legal counsel for the West Contra Costa Unified School District.

03:56:21.000 --> 03:56:34.000
And I ask this board to follow the recommendation of the CDE staff and not to renew the charter of John Henry High School. Contrary to John Henry High School's statement, this board may certainly deny the renewal under the law.

03:56:34.000 --> 03:56:48.000
The district's decision not to renew comes with some context where A method public schools chose not to address what had been ongoing district concerns about recruiting English learners, particularly English learners who had less fluency in English,

03:56:48.000 --> 03:57:04.000
about the educational program for English learners, about the lack of recruitment and program for students with disabilities, about a lack of staffing for these students, about high school and administrator, I'm sorry, high teacher and administrator turnover that was impacting the educational program,

03:57:04.000 --> 03:57:13.000
and about a lack of transparency and accountability. The board should take this vote not based on the reputation of a school, but take a vote in light of the facts.

03:57:14.000 --> 03:57:22.000
Keeping with the intent of the recent changes under AB 1505, we ask this board to honor the concerns of the district and not renew the charter. Thank you.

Hello, my name is Sarah Butler. I'm a trustee on the Contra Costa County Board of Education. I urge you to support the CDE recommendation for denial of John Henry High School due to the many issues involved.

03:57:50.000 --> 03:58:00.000
Specifically, I want to call your attention to the West Contra Costa document in your documents folder titled NOV, which is for notice of violation.

03:58:00.000 --> 03:58:12.000
The notice of violation includes, that was from November 2018, and I know that's a while ago, but some of these violations are still not corrected.

03:58:12.000 --> 03:58:23.000
They included teacher credentialing, special education, the lottery and admissions process, and compliance with the confidential use permit for the facility.

03:58:23.000 --> 03:58:40.000
Anyway, the admissions process is still a big problem. There are nine positions open of the 18 positions for John Henry, and special education, you've already heard, is not being done adequately for those students. Thank you very much.

Estoy hablando por John Henry. Soy residente de la ciudad de Richmond, madre de dos hijos, uno que se graduó este año de John Henry y el otro que irá al nueve. Estoy agradecida con la escuela por haberme recibido a mi hijo. Vino hace un año y medio del Salvador.

03:59:46.000 --> 04:00:09.000
Aprendió el 90% de inglés, lo escribe, y está preparado para ir al colegio. Gracias a John Henry, a los maestros, a nuestra directora, por apoyarlo, por confiar en él. Espero también que mi hijo pueda ir y se pueda graduar. Tenga ese privilegio de graduarse en John Henry.

04:00:09.000 --> 04:00:25.000
Me siento tan segura cuando me voy a mi trabajo, al contrario de las otras escuelas, donde hay una inseguridad en la que los padres estamos con miedo de dejar nuestros hijos porque a cada momento habla la policía que hay problemas.

04:00:25.000 --> 04:00:45.000
Nosotros nos sentimos inseguros. John Henry tiene todo. Por favor, denos esta oportunidad. Necesitamos nuestros hijos. Necesitamos una alegría. Hace unos meses tuvimos una tristeza.

Yes, of course. Good afternoon. My name is Moreno Larry and I am calling on behalf of John Henry. I'm a citizen and resident of Richmond. I am mother of two, one that will be graduating this year, the other one is attending ninth grade.

04:01:04.000 --> 04:01:15.000
We were here from El Salvador, and we are so thankful for John Henry 90% my son, it's 90% not proficient in English tank thanks to the teachers the support they supported him.

04:01:15.000 --> 04:01:25.000
It would be a privilege for him to graduate and we feel confident in the work that they do here at John Henry, unlike other schools that are full of uncertainty and problems with the police.

04:01:25.000 --> 04:01:35.000
I see that they have this uncertainty all the time, please give it another opportunity. We're full of happiness and we're just sad to see what's going on.

04:01:35.000 --> 04:01:40.000

Hi, my name is Tammy Campbell and I'm an education advocate and taxpayer in the West Contra Costa Unified School District, requesting a denial of the john Henry charter to WCUSD staff provided you with an extensive report, and the school board denied the renewal of the charter on the following

04:02:04.000 --> 04:02:32.000
Lack of growth for English language learners and declines in academic achievement, lack of transparency and accountability, failure of staff to provide a legally accurate special education program, significant teacher turnover, promotion of modern day segregation, and as a taxpayer it financially impacts my other public schools in my school district, and why would you turn over what the local jurisdictions have already deemed not renewable?

04:02:33.000 --> 04:02:39.000
I urge you not to support the renewal of john Henry. Thank you.

04:03:10.000 --> 04:03:17.000
My name is Coy Vargas and I have a girl in grade 10 who is going to 11.

04:03:17.000 --> 04:03:24.000
I feel very happy to have my daughter in this school, since academically she has progressed a lot.

04:03:24.000 --> 04:03:31.000
She has always been good at school, but now she feels very happy because the teachers help her a lot.

04:03:31.000 --> 04:03:43.000
In fact, I don't know, but I feel happy that the teachers, the same director, make personal calls to tell us that our children need to complete a certain task.

04:03:43.000 --> 04:03:48.000
I have the commitment to tell my daughter that she has to finish this task, especially in English.

04:03:48.000 --> 04:03:55.000
The teacher and I are very happy with English because she has always put a lot of effort into it, and I am very happy with this school,

04:03:55.000 --> 04:03:59.000
I am very sad that they are going to close it, but I always believe in God that it will remain open.

04:03:59.000 --> 04:04:07.000
And I thank the teachers, the director, and all of you who do a wonderful job so that all schools are functioning well.

04:04:07.000 --> 04:04:15.000
Especially John Henry, for me, it is a school that has opened my heart and I hope that all of you are there.

04:04:15.000 --> 04:04:19.000
Translator, could you please provide us translation? Thank you.

04:04:19.000 --> 04:04:24.000
Yeah, my name is Cuy Vargas. My daughter attends John Henry. She's 11 years old.

04:04:24.000 --> 04:04:30.000
I'm happy to be...

04:04:30.000 --> 04:04:34.000
I'm happy that she's at this school. The teachers are great.

04:04:34.000 --> 04:04:47.000
Teachers call me to let us know if there's homework outstanding, and it makes me very sad to know that there's a possibility of a school closing.

04:04:47.000 --> 04:04:57.000
I encourage you to please keep John Henry open. Thank you.

04:04:57.000 --> 04:05:16.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record to provide public comment for John Henry. Your time starts now.

04:05:16.000 --> 04:05:21.000
Caller, did you want to provide public comment for John Henry?

04:05:21.000 --> 04:05:29.000
Hi, this is Esmeralda Vinsalas. Am I on the line? Yes, you are. Please go ahead and we'll start your time.

04:05:29.000 --> 04:05:40.000
Okay, thank you. Yes, I work at the front office at John Henry High School, and not only do I see the interactions between the students, the parents, the teachers, etc.

04:05:40.000 --> 04:05:50.000
I see so much care that goes into and so much effort, not just on an educational level, but also caring for them, for their welfare, for what's going on with their families, and so forth.

04:05:50.000 --> 04:05:59.000
I retired from the University of California, Berkeley, 37 years there. So many students told me how they wish they would have gone to a school like John Henry.

04:05:59.000 --> 04:06:05.000
I wish that I could have raised my kids at this school, and they all graduated from West Hunter Costa Unified School District.

04:06:05.000 --> 04:06:13.000
I went to Berkeley High School where predominantly there were other ethnicities, and Hispanics were not represented, but I can't blame the school for that.

04:06:13.000 --> 04:06:22.000
I cannot, and I strongly urge you to please renew the charter for John Henry High School. Thank you so much for your time.

04:06:22.000 --> 04:06:30.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record to provide public comment for John Henry. Your time starts now.

04:06:30.000 --> 04:06:41.000
Yes, good afternoon. My name is Edgar Quiroz, and I'm a homeowner, taxpayer, and resident of West Contra Costa County, and I serve as a volunteer board member of AMPS.

04:06:41.000 --> 04:06:48.000
Thank you for the opportunity to express my sincere and strongest support for the renewal of John Henry High School.

04:06:48.000 --> 04:07:02.000
As I sit here to listen to the opposition who is asking not to renew, I am appalled and saddened at accusations of this being a segregated model of education.

04:07:02.000 --> 04:07:15.000
I'm a retired diversity and inclusion executive with Kaiser Permanente after 29 years, and to divide communities of color the way the opponents are is a disgrace.

04:07:15.000 --> 04:07:19.000
John Henry High School matters.

04:07:19.000 --> 04:07:34.000
The students and teachers of John Henry matter, and because of the parents and the community support of Richmond, Richmond matters. Thank you very much. Please vote in favor of John Henry High.

04:07:34.000 --> 04:07:42.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record to provide public comment for John Henry. Your time starts now.

04:07:45.000 --> 04:07:50.000
My name is John.

04:07:50.000 --> 04:07:54.000
John Henry High School matters.

04:07:54.000 --> 04:07:57.000
The students and teachers of John Henry matter.

04:07:57.000 --> 04:08:01.000
I'm sorry, caller, we're not hearing your.

04:08:02.000 --> 04:08:09.000
Okay, my name is John Erminger and I'm a recently retired teacher in West Contra Costa.

04:08:09.000 --> 04:08:24.000
I want to point out that the our local board rejected John Henry, the county rejected John Henry, and as of now, I know it was July 1st, the law changed.

04:08:24.000 --> 04:08:31.000
So this definitely violates the spirit of local control. Thank you.

04:08:31.000 --> 04:08:42.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record and begin to provide public comment for John Henry. Your time starts now.

04:08:42.000 --> 04:08:46.000
Hello. Yes, we can hear you. Please state your name and record.

04:08:46.000 --> 04:08:51.000
Please. I'm sorry. Please say your name and affiliation.

04:08:51.000 --> 04:08:55.000
My name is Jennifer laugh. I'm a community observer.

04:08:55.000 --> 04:09:05.000
John Henry staff is diligent making connections with students and families outside of school time to ensure student success, which I believe is demonstrated in their test scores.

04:09:05.000 --> 04:09:08.960
outside of school time to ensure student success which I believe

04:09:08.960 --> 04:09:10.800
is demonstrated in their test scores their

04:09:10.800 --> 04:09:13.080
four year university admission rates and their

04:09:13.080 --> 04:09:15.000
recent six year WASC accreditation.

04:09:15.000 --> 04:09:17.680
Though there are issues that John Henry does need

04:09:17.680 --> 04:09:19.680
to address I would like to urge the board

04:09:19.680 --> 04:09:22.280
to continue John Henry's charter both to allow

04:09:22.280 --> 04:09:24.760
for clarification of the wide gap of information

04:09:24.760 --> 04:09:27.600
presented by both sides today and to allow

04:09:27.600 --> 04:09:31.040
the school time to remediate the cited issues particularly

04:09:31.040 --> 04:09:33.360
because communication of concerns by the district

04:09:33.640 --> 04:09:36.280
including the reasons for stated non-renewal have

04:09:36.280 --> 04:09:38.680
disputed timing motivation and origin.

04:09:38.680 --> 04:09:41.560
I'd also like to recommend that the board note

04:09:41.560 --> 04:09:44.400
that multiple people called in on behalf of John Henry

04:09:44.400 --> 04:09:47.520
earlier and many of our parents don't have the flexibility

04:09:47.520 --> 04:09:50.080
of with work to ask for more hours off today

04:09:50.080 --> 04:09:51.760
especially on short notice.

04:09:51.760 --> 04:09:55.760
When we talk about barriers to access this is it in real time.

04:09:55.760 --> 04:09:58.480
So I'd respectfully ask all board members and IT

04:09:58.480 --> 04:10:01.240
staff to convene about 30 minutes to answer

04:10:01.320 --> 04:10:04.320
the public part time which was 830 for today.

04:10:04.320 --> 04:10:06.520
Tech happens but we've got to do better. Thank you.

04:10:09.240 --> 04:10:11.120
Next caller please state your name and affiliation

Your time starts now.

04:10:20.280 --> 04:10:21.280
Can you hear me.

04:10:22.120 --> 04:10:23.120
Yes we can hear you.

04:10:24.560 --> 04:10:25.520
Okay.

04:10:25.520 --> 04:10:28.760
My name is Angel Lopez and I'm going into 12th grade

04:10:28.760 --> 04:10:31.400
and I say that in theory because John Henry High School

04:10:31.400 --> 04:10:33.520
has not been approved to continue operating

04:10:33.520 --> 04:10:36.600
and I have been at every meet I have been to every meeting

04:10:36.600 --> 04:10:39.400
with the state and the district and I have spoken

04:10:39.400 --> 04:10:41.160
for my school without much understanding

04:10:41.160 --> 04:10:42.840
of the reasons why people are interested

04:10:42.840 --> 04:10:44.480
in John Henry High School closing.

04:10:45.320 --> 04:10:47.160
In my school I am listened to.

04:10:47.160 --> 04:10:49.840
My teachers are interested in me and they push me

04:10:49.840 --> 04:10:51.120
to make an effort every day.

04:10:52.560 --> 04:10:54.800
I find the support to them to finish my education

04:10:54.800 --> 04:10:57.160
successfully and make it easier and they make it easier

04:10:57.200 --> 04:10:58.800
for me to get into a four year college

04:10:58.800 --> 04:10:59.800
and to actually finish it.

04:11:00.800 --> 04:11:02.600
I am asking to please keep John Henry open.

04:11:04.120 --> 04:11:05.120
Thank you.

04:11:07.040 --> 04:11:08.960

04:11:19.520 --> 04:11:21.840
Hi. Good afternoon. My name is Ingrid Gonzalez

04:11:21.840 --> 04:11:24.960
and I was calling because I want the school to remain open.

04:11:25.000 --> 04:11:28.120
I have my child who is currently in Benito Juarez

04:11:28.120 --> 04:11:30.480
and I chose this school because of the fact

04:11:30.480 --> 04:11:32.640
that you guys had the extension all the way to high school

04:11:32.640 --> 04:11:35.480
and I didn't want my child to go through the process

04:11:35.480 --> 04:11:38.800
of moving schools and you know having to meet

04:11:38.800 --> 04:11:39.720
new friends and all that.

04:11:39.720 --> 04:11:42.120
So I was very excited when I found this school

04:11:42.120 --> 04:11:46.240
in my community with high stats high test scoring

04:11:46.240 --> 04:11:50.400
good teachers safe location near the police station.

04:11:51.160 --> 04:11:54.400
I am we are Latino parents we are a Latino family

04:11:54.440 --> 04:11:59.920
and I never have ever felt any type of rage towards us

04:11:59.920 --> 04:12:03.560
or even other you know racist African-American.

04:12:03.560 --> 04:12:05.200
I've heard you guys think about that.

04:12:05.200 --> 04:12:08.800
I don't believe this was racist racist at all.

04:12:09.600 --> 04:12:13.000
I feel like every school every child is welcome.

04:12:13.000 --> 04:12:17.120
So I do want you guys to remain open. Thank you.

I'm the parent of a K-12 West Contra Costa

04:12:35.400 --> 04:12:38.600
Unified School District graduate and I urge you to deny

04:12:38.600 --> 04:12:40.880
the John Henry High School renewal petition.

04:12:41.520 --> 04:12:43.160
Thank you for this opportunity to speak.

04:12:43.840 --> 04:12:46.880
As a parent who's attended many many school board meetings

04:12:46.880 --> 04:12:48.920
I've been appalled by John Henry High School's

04:12:48.920 --> 04:12:51.320
lack of adherence to the laws regarding abuse

04:12:51.320 --> 04:12:53.480
and harassment complaints by students.

04:12:54.080 --> 04:12:56.600
Please listen to both the local school board

04:12:56.600 --> 04:12:59.200
and the county school board deny the John Henry High

04:12:59.200 --> 04:13:01.040

04:14:53.120 --> 04:14:54.760
I am speaking to support John Henry.

04:14:54.760 --> 04:14:57.040
I am the mother of six and I am very happy

04:14:57.040 --> 04:14:59.040
that my children attend the school.

04:14:59.080 --> 04:15:02.160
One is there and one is about to get into ninth grade.

04:15:02.160 --> 04:15:03.840
I am concerned when I heard about the decision

04:15:03.840 --> 04:15:07.320
to close the school I would like for it to remain open.

04:15:07.320 --> 04:15:09.720
I feel safe. I feel happy.

04:15:09.720 --> 04:15:13.440
I see the grades of my daughter was there at John Henry

04:15:13.440 --> 04:15:15.240
and that makes me happy.

04:15:15.240 --> 04:15:17.040
I would like for it to keep it open.

04:15:17.040 --> 04:15:19.560
My goal is for all of them to become professionals.

04:15:19.560 --> 04:15:21.720
When you are a mother of six it is never easy.

04:15:21.720 --> 04:15:24.520

My name is Patricia.

04:15:41.520 --> 04:15:44.920
I'm calling because I want John Henry to remain open

04:15:44.920 --> 04:15:48.440
because I see how John Henry has told my daughter

04:15:48.440 --> 04:15:51.720
in her education and to complete her goals.

04:15:52.320 --> 04:15:56.640
Also I have a son in seventh grade and I want him to have

04:15:56.640 --> 04:15:59.400
the same opportunity as my daughter and I'm pretty

04:15:59.400 --> 04:16:02.360
sure if you close John Henry my son will have

04:16:02.360 --> 04:16:04.080
the opportunity that my daughter has.

04:16:05.080 --> 04:16:07.720
Please renew John John Henry open.

04:16:07.720 --> 04:16:11.880
To be honest I haven't enrolled my daughter in any school

04:16:11.880 --> 04:16:14.720
because around my neighbor I don't see any good school

04:16:14.720 --> 04:16:18.680
for her so please keep John Henry open. Thank you.

04:16:58.680 --> 04:16:59.960
noveno grado.

04:16:59.960 --> 04:17:03.520

04:17:14.400 --> 04:17:18.600
Veo la seguridad del lugar.

04:17:18.600 --> 04:17:20.840
Es muy bueno. Los maestros son excelentes.

04:17:20.840 --> 04:17:23.960
Y lo que viene siendo la directora ha hecho un buen

04:17:23.960 --> 04:17:27.960
trabajo para que los estudiantes promoverlos y apoyarlos para que

04:17:27.960 --> 04:17:28.960
sigan a la universidad.

04:17:31.280 --> 04:17:35.560
Pido que por favor no cierren la escuela.

04:17:37.120 --> 04:17:41.880
Ya que va a ser afectado para mis hijas.

04:17:41.920 --> 04:17:45.640
El modelo se plantea de un lado por favor.

04:17:47.160 --> 04:17:48.640
Necesitamos de su apoyo.

04:17:50.320 --> 04:17:52.040
Para la apertura de John Henry.

04:17:58.240 --> 04:18:00.560
Hello, my name is Guadalupe Migón.

04:18:00.560 --> 04:18:04.600
I have three daughters, one currently at John Henry.

04:18:04.600 --> 04:18:09.960
It is important for me to know that she can stay at John Henry.

04:18:12.000 --> 04:18:14.520
They have great teachers.

04:18:14.520 --> 04:18:15.720
There's great security.

04:18:17.040 --> 04:18:20.960
The teachers provide support for my daughter to move on to

04:18:20.960 --> 04:18:22.160
college.

04:18:22.160 --> 04:18:27.160
I hope that they don't close John Henry.

04:18:28.440 --> 04:18:31.840
Please, I pray that they stay open.

04:18:36.800 --> 04:18:39.680
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the

04:18:39.680 --> 04:18:41.880
record to provide public comment for John Henry.

04:18:41.880 --> 04:18:42.960
Your time starts now.

04:18:48.760 --> 04:18:51.160
Good afternoon. My name is Dmitry Gonzalez and I'm a teacher

04:18:51.160 --> 04:18:52.280
in West Bantacosta.

04:18:52.280 --> 04:18:54.800
I am opposing the renewal of John Henry High School.

04:18:54.800 --> 04:18:57.240
Currently, John Henry High School only serves 10 students

04:18:57.240 --> 04:18:58.200
with IEPs.

04:18:58.200 --> 04:19:01.960
This shockingly low number when compared to their total

04:19:01.960 --> 04:19:03.080
population.

04:19:03.080 --> 04:19:05.720
They have failed to recruit students with IEPs and have not

04:19:05.720 --> 04:19:07.560
supported those students they serve.

04:19:07.600 --> 04:19:09.640
In fact, the California Department of Education has

04:19:09.640 --> 04:19:12.160
already flagged John Henry High School for failing the

04:19:12.160 --> 04:19:15.720
adequate test, the few students they do have.

04:19:15.720 --> 04:19:19.920
In 2018, WCOSD investigated a claim that SPED students were

04:19:19.920 --> 04:19:22.600
not receiving their minutes as required in their IEP.

04:19:22.600 --> 04:19:26.040
Staff found out that minutes were being made in three-minute

04:19:26.040 --> 04:19:27.720
blocks at the end of class.

04:19:27.720 --> 04:19:30.240
No one should think that three minutes is enough time to

04:19:30.240 --> 04:19:32.640
adequately support student learning and development.

04:19:32.640 --> 04:19:34.360
I ask that you please oppose the renewal.

04:19:38.520 --> 04:19:40.880
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the

04:19:40.880 --> 04:19:43.120

Your time starts now.

04:19:48.080 --> 04:19:51.400
My name is Nicole Estrada and I'm calling as a member of the

04:19:51.400 --> 04:19:53.960
community in support of John Henry High School.

04:19:53.960 --> 04:19:56.720
As a Latina working in the Bay Area tech industry,

04:19:56.720 --> 04:20:00.240
I see how underrepresented we are in the Bay Area's largest

04:20:00.240 --> 04:20:03.680
and most profitable industry and it deeply saddens me.

04:20:03.680 --> 04:20:06.920
John Henry High School's success in graduating its black and brown

04:20:06.960 --> 04:20:10.360
students into four-year colleges at a rate of over 90 percent

04:20:10.360 --> 04:20:13.800
gives me hope that this reality is changing and that our

04:20:13.800 --> 04:20:16.200
next generation will have greater opportunities

04:20:16.200 --> 04:20:17.920
to participate and thrive.

04:20:17.920 --> 04:20:21.200
Please follow the ACCS recommendation and renew

04:20:21.200 --> 04:20:22.960
John Henry High School so that they can

04:20:22.960 --> 04:20:24.400
continue their great work.

04:20:28.400 --> 04:20:30.200
Next caller, please state your name and record

04:20:30.200 --> 04:20:33.480

04:20:35.280 --> 04:20:36.520
Your time starts now.

04:20:36.920 --> 04:20:41.920
Hello community.

04:20:41.920 --> 04:20:42.920
Yes.

04:20:42.920 --> 04:20:43.920
Hello.

04:20:43.920 --> 04:20:47.840
My name is Liam Dillow.

04:20:47.840 --> 04:20:50.360
I'm a credentialed chemistry and technology third-year

04:20:50.360 --> 04:20:53.040
teacher at John Henry High School and I'd like to express

04:20:53.040 --> 04:20:55.160
my strong support for the school particularly

04:20:55.160 --> 04:20:57.000
for its attention to underserved students.

04:20:57.720 --> 04:20:59.680
I first want to point out what seems to be overlooked

04:20:59.680 --> 04:21:01.240
today as it's shown in the data earlier.

04:21:01.240 --> 04:21:05.760
We have a 91 percent low socioeconomic status

04:21:05.800 --> 04:21:08.600
population which is actually higher than the rate

04:21:08.600 --> 04:21:09.720
at the surrounding community.

04:21:10.280 --> 04:21:12.320
In terms of racial equity I'd like to state

04:21:12.320 --> 04:21:14.000
that our population is represented

04:21:14.000 --> 04:21:15.840
of who applies which we do not control.

04:21:15.840 --> 04:21:18.720
I will state that I personally had close relationships

04:21:18.720 --> 04:21:21.200
with several of our students who happen to be black.

04:21:21.200 --> 04:21:23.880
At least three of which who have spoken in support

04:21:23.880 --> 04:21:25.400
of our school in recent hearings.

04:21:25.400 --> 04:21:28.040
Three of my former students recently graduated

04:21:28.040 --> 04:21:29.600
and are going to four-year institutions.

04:21:29.600 --> 04:21:31.560
I hardly see how this constitutes

04:21:31.560 --> 04:21:32.960
segregation or racism.

04:21:33.680 --> 04:21:35.520
Our site leader has stated a plan to recruit

04:21:35.520 --> 04:21:36.840
a more diverse population.

04:21:36.840 --> 04:21:38.480
I'm personally willing to knock on doors

04:21:38.480 --> 04:21:40.160
in the community to support this plan.

04:21:40.760 --> 04:21:42.800
Finally our special education population

04:21:43.320 --> 04:21:45.160
in my time in public charter schools I have not

04:21:45.160 --> 04:21:47.800
seen more attention come to ELL or SPED students.

04:21:47.800 --> 04:21:50.320
I've also seen at least seven of my students

04:21:50.320 --> 04:21:52.600
with IEP's survival whole plan speak in support

04:21:52.600 --> 04:21:55.320
of the school in recent hearings for John Henry.

04:21:58.520 --> 04:22:00.480

04:22:07.840 --> 04:22:10.560
Hello my name is Michelle Cordero and I'm calling

04:22:10.560 --> 04:22:13.600
to tell you to please renew John Henry High School.

04:22:13.600 --> 04:22:15.640
This school has helped me so much

04:22:16.200 --> 04:22:18.200
by helping me achieve my goal.

04:22:18.200 --> 04:22:21.880
My brother's in seventh grade and I would love it if he goes

04:22:21.880 --> 04:22:24.240
to John Henry High School that we keep to achieve

04:22:24.240 --> 04:22:25.800
his goals like I am.

04:22:25.800 --> 04:22:27.680
Please renew John Henry. Thank you.

04:22:29.880 --> 04:22:31.800

Your time starts now.

04:22:40.000 --> 04:22:42.560
Hello can you hear me. Yes.

04:22:45.120 --> 04:22:47.120
Hi good afternoon. My name is Luis Romo.

04:22:47.120 --> 04:22:49.240
I'm a Richmond resident and graduate

04:22:49.240 --> 04:22:51.800
of Richmond High School and now an employee

04:22:51.800 --> 04:22:54.040
at A Method Public Schools calling in support

04:22:54.040 --> 04:22:55.400
of John Henry High.

04:22:55.400 --> 04:22:58.040
Despite the current uncertainty we still have more

04:22:58.040 --> 04:23:00.920
than 120 families on our waiting list for the incoming

04:23:00.920 --> 04:23:02.260
9th grade class.

04:23:02.260 --> 04:23:04.880
Families remain hopeful and committed to John Henry.

04:23:05.640 --> 04:23:08.200
We want the opportunity to continue building our program.

04:23:08.200 --> 04:23:11.120
We've only we're only five years old and you can see

04:23:11.120 --> 04:23:13.200
the positive impact that John Henry is making

04:23:13.200 --> 04:23:14.640
in the community.

04:23:14.640 --> 04:23:17.080
We have outperformed all of the surrounding schools

04:23:17.080 --> 04:23:20.320
in both math English and math since we began

04:23:20.320 --> 04:23:21.320
SBAC testing.

04:23:21.960 --> 04:23:25.520
In 2019 John Henry received a 6-year WASC

04:23:25.520 --> 04:23:27.600
accreditation status and a letter of support

04:23:27.640 --> 04:23:30.880
from Dr. David Brown the WASC visiting chair.

04:23:32.240 --> 04:23:34.560
This year we were recognized as one of the best

04:23:34.560 --> 04:23:37.960
public high schools by the U.S. News and World Report.

04:23:37.960 --> 04:23:41.240
In 2018 we received a letter of good standing

04:23:41.240 --> 04:23:44.400
from WCC USD Superintendent and have not received

04:23:44.400 --> 04:23:47.280
any complaints or letters of concern since.

04:23:48.000 --> 04:23:51.600
And finally the 8CCS recommended that time will be renewed

04:23:51.600 --> 04:23:55.960
by a 7 to 2 vote this past month. Please keep John Henry open.

04:23:57.880 --> 04:23:59.840
Next caller please state your name and affiliation

04:23:59.840 --> 04:24:02.280
for the record to provide public comment for John Henry.

04:24:02.280 --> 04:24:03.280
Your time starts now.

04:24:07.760 --> 04:24:10.120
My name is Don Gosney and I own an online

04:24:10.120 --> 04:24:12.200
newspaper Radio Free Richmond which attempts

04:24:12.200 --> 04:24:14.880
to disseminate what goes on at our charter schools.

04:24:14.880 --> 04:24:17.040
I hope you all can understand that this isn't

04:24:17.040 --> 04:24:18.480
about test scores and achievement.

04:24:18.480 --> 04:24:20.960
It's about the school and you cannot divorce

04:24:20.960 --> 04:24:22.760
John Henry High School from the company

04:24:22.760 --> 04:24:24.360
that owns and operates it.

04:24:24.360 --> 04:24:26.080
And that would be a method public school.

04:24:26.440 --> 04:24:28.040
I sent you a detailed list of problems

04:24:28.040 --> 04:24:30.960
that AMP has had with disclosure finances staff

04:24:30.960 --> 04:24:33.640
and administration turnover on credentialed teachers

04:24:33.640 --> 04:24:36.560
treatment of the community sexual bullying communication

04:24:36.560 --> 04:24:38.760
with the community and the media failure to adhere

04:24:38.760 --> 04:24:40.880
to their agreements failure to address concerns

04:24:40.880 --> 04:24:44.120
repeatedly brought up by the WCC USD fomenting

04:24:44.120 --> 04:24:47.560
a potentially dangerous situation at the WCC USD

04:24:47.560 --> 04:24:50.000
board meeting when the renewal petition was initially

04:24:50.000 --> 04:24:52.440
denied and some serious difficulty embracing

04:24:52.440 --> 04:24:53.520
the Brown Act.

04:24:53.520 --> 04:24:55.760
Given that my report didn't resemble any of the hundreds

04:24:55.760 --> 04:24:57.520
of form letters you may have been sent.

04:24:57.520 --> 04:24:59.600
I hope you had an opportunity to peruse it.

04:24:59.600 --> 04:25:01.520
Given that we all want what's best for the kids

04:25:01.520 --> 04:25:03.240
and their parents it would be nice to issue

04:25:03.240 --> 04:25:05.080
a renewal condition on AMP's getting their

04:25:05.080 --> 04:25:05.960
house in order.

04:25:05.960 --> 04:25:08.000
But that's not an option for you is it.

04:25:08.000 --> 04:25:09.720
So do you give AMP the five-year license

04:25:09.720 --> 04:25:11.000
to continue as they have.

04:25:11.000 --> 04:25:11.560
Time.

04:25:11.560 --> 04:25:12.960
Doesn't solve any of the problems

04:25:12.960 --> 04:25:14.560
that they've got just here. Thank you.

04:25:25.760 --> 04:25:37.360
Hello can you hear me.

04:25:37.360 --> 04:25:38.400
Yes we can hear you.

04:25:38.400 --> 04:25:40.280
Please please state your name and affiliation.

04:25:42.080 --> 04:25:46.720
My name is Jane Wong and I am a parent of two boys.

04:25:47.960 --> 04:25:52.400
One attended John Henry and finished and had so many

04:25:52.440 --> 04:25:57.280
offers from CSU's UC's and USC.

04:25:58.120 --> 04:26:01.840
I'm a proud parent of this community and my second

04:26:01.840 --> 04:26:04.480
son I hopefully will be in the same footsteps.

04:26:06.040 --> 04:26:08.840
My request is please don't shut down John Henry.

04:26:09.600 --> 04:26:11.960
It will be a disservice to the bright futures

04:26:11.960 --> 04:26:13.160
of our leaders.

04:26:13.160 --> 04:26:16.200
I am also a homeowner and I am still continuing

04:26:16.200 --> 04:26:21.520
to pay seven bonds for the West Contra Costa

04:26:21.600 --> 04:26:26.160
Unified School District seven bonds for the school district.

04:26:26.160 --> 04:26:30.400
So we as parents should have choices for our children

04:26:30.400 --> 04:26:35.360
to attend what schools they will need to propagate

04:26:35.360 --> 04:26:39.760
their academic achievements and their career goals.

04:26:40.480 --> 04:26:43.800
And they will definitely be strong constituents

04:26:43.800 --> 04:26:46.440
in our community time and they will be leading

04:26:46.440 --> 04:26:50.360
our community in the next few years. Thank you.

04:27:07.120 --> 04:27:08.200
Yes good afternoon.

04:27:08.200 --> 04:27:11.120
My name is Veronica Alvarez and I am calling in support

04:27:11.120 --> 04:27:12.480
for John Henry High School.

04:27:12.480 --> 04:27:15.080
I am proud parent of two daughters who are part

04:27:15.080 --> 04:27:16.840
of the John Henry community.

04:27:16.840 --> 04:27:20.360
My oldest daughter graduated from John Henry in 2019

04:27:20.400 --> 04:27:23.520
and is currently attending a four-year university.

04:27:23.520 --> 04:27:26.440
My 15-year-old daughter attended Richmond Chatter

04:27:26.440 --> 04:27:28.920
Academy for middle school and completed

04:27:28.920 --> 04:27:31.040
her freshman year at John Henry.

04:27:31.040 --> 04:27:33.960
I was decided to keep her in the Ames family

04:27:33.960 --> 04:27:36.800
because all of the help they provided for my

04:27:36.800 --> 04:27:40.040
the support of my daughter my older daughter.

04:27:40.040 --> 04:27:43.080
You are adding unnecessary stress to our students.

04:27:43.080 --> 04:27:45.400
They worry about where they will go to school

04:27:45.400 --> 04:27:46.760
for the next year.

04:27:46.760 --> 04:27:49.120
Please keep that option open to them.

04:27:49.480 --> 04:27:52.600
Parents enroll all children but they are the ones

04:27:52.600 --> 04:27:56.520
who want to stay in the right decision life in your hands.

04:27:56.520 --> 04:27:57.840

Yes we can hear you.

I think you'll probably have some background speaker.

04:28:19.640 --> 04:28:20.640
Background speaker.

04:28:20.640 --> 04:28:21.640
Ok.

04:28:21.640 --> 04:28:22.640
Would you like.

04:28:26.640 --> 04:28:27.640
We need you to.

04:28:27.640 --> 04:28:28.640
Can you hear me.

04:28:28.640 --> 04:28:29.640
Can you hear me.

04:28:29.640 --> 04:28:30.640

We're receiving an echo.

04:29:00.580 --> 04:29:03.260
You need to turn down the volume on your speaker,

Okay, we have no additional public comment in the caller queue at this time.

04:29:49.620 --> 04:29:55.740
We do have several other callers that are on the call-in line.

04:29:55.740 --> 04:30:00.580
This call-in line is for callers wishing to make public comment for John Henry High.

04:30:00.580 --> 04:30:04.300
If you are calling to make a public comment on another school, we ask that you disconnect

04:30:04.300 --> 04:30:05.300
from the line right now.

04:30:05.300 --> 04:30:09.940
You'll need to call in when we're accepting public comment for that item.

04:30:09.940 --> 04:30:13.660
Can we please get the Spanish translation of that also, that this comment that we're

04:30:16.860 --> 04:30:23.340
The calls that we're accepting right now are only for the number 20 on the agenda, which

04:30:23.340 --> 04:30:25.500
is the case of John Henry.

04:30:25.500 --> 04:30:29.980
For the next calls, you'll need to call in again and wait for the next call.

04:30:29.980 --> 04:30:33.180

04:30:44.980 --> 04:30:47.100
Hello, we can hear you.

04:30:47.100 --> 04:30:49.300
Did you want to make public comment for John Henry?

04:30:49.300 --> 04:30:50.300
Yes.

04:30:50.300 --> 04:30:53.340
Please state your name and affiliation.

04:30:53.340 --> 04:30:55.900
Your time starts now.

04:30:55.900 --> 04:30:56.900
My name is Dulce Bernal.

04:30:56.900 --> 04:31:00.540
I'm the mother of a son in John Henry.

04:31:00.540 --> 04:31:02.700
He's in 11th grade.

04:31:02.700 --> 04:31:04.940
He wanted to attend 12th grade for next year.

04:31:04.940 --> 04:31:09.220
I'm asking you to please consider to keep John Henry open.

04:31:09.220 --> 04:31:14.220
My son is under a lot of stress because he doesn't know what school he's going to attend.

04:31:14.220 --> 04:31:20.220
And also, he received a little bit of interest from different universities.

04:31:20.220 --> 04:31:23.060
One of the universities in Bauer Harbor.

04:31:23.060 --> 04:31:27.740
But letting you know that, that's telling you that John Henry is doing their job by

04:31:27.740 --> 04:31:30.300
preparing our kids for the universities.

04:31:30.300 --> 04:31:35.580
Many universities are looking to our kids and it starts the interest of them.

04:31:36.340 --> 04:31:40.980
They don't want to keep John Henry open because they're doing a very lousy job not preparing

04:31:40.980 --> 04:31:41.980
their students.

04:31:41.980 --> 04:31:47.900
So I want you to take under consideration what our students, our teachers, our community

04:31:47.900 --> 04:31:48.900
are doing.

04:31:48.900 --> 04:31:56.660
So hard all this year for John Henry and they've been doing so much even if they have so much

04:31:56.660 --> 04:31:57.660
stress.

04:31:57.660 --> 04:32:02.140
So please keep John Henry open and don't give more stress to our kids and let them prove

04:32:02.140 --> 04:32:04.060
that they can do much, much better.

04:32:04.060 --> 04:32:05.060

04:34:04.300 --> 04:34:05.300
Good afternoon, board members.

04:34:05.300 --> 04:34:07.300
My name is Jeff Robinette.

04:34:07.300 --> 04:34:13.300
I am a proud African American father of a 2020 graduate from John Henry High School.

04:34:13.300 --> 04:34:19.300
I'm speaking on behalf of 15 African American students and their families on a wait list

04:34:19.300 --> 04:34:24.300
who, if selected, are committed to attend John Henry High School in the fall.

04:34:25.300 --> 04:34:29.300
While not guaranteed, these students deserve the right to attend a safe and progressive

04:34:29.300 --> 04:34:32.300
school just as my child was able to do.

04:34:32.300 --> 04:34:38.300
If John Henry is closed, please know that there will be no viable choices in the West

04:34:38.300 --> 04:34:41.300
Contra Costa Unified School District for them to attend.

04:34:41.300 --> 04:34:46.300
Time doesn't allow for me to list all of the outstanding achievements of this school.

04:34:46.300 --> 04:34:51.300
Its permanent closure will devastate hundreds of students and their families as well as

04:34:51.300 --> 04:34:53.300
having a negative effect in our community.

04:34:53.300 --> 04:34:55.300
Please vote to keep our school open.

04:34:55.300 --> 04:35:00.300
As far as the claim of lack of diversity where a black family, for us it was a matter of

04:35:00.300 --> 04:35:01.300
choice.

04:35:01.300 --> 04:35:07.300
John Henry High School not only welcomed us with open arms, but racism just simply doesn't

04:35:07.300 --> 04:35:08.300
exist.

04:35:08.300 --> 04:35:09.300
Time.

04:35:09.300 --> 04:35:10.300
Fantastic school.

04:35:10.300 --> 04:35:11.300
Please keep it open.

04:35:11.300 --> 04:35:12.300
Thank you.

04:35:12.300 --> 04:35:24.300
Caller, did you wish to make a public comment for John Henry High?

04:35:24.300 --> 04:35:25.300

04:35:25.300 --> 04:35:30.300
At this time, we will disconnect you from the call if you're calling for today's fresh

04:35:30.300 --> 04:35:31.300
start for the next item.

04:35:31.300 --> 04:35:34.300
We'll need you to call back in when we're taking public comment at that time.

04:35:34.300 --> 04:35:37.300
What time would that be, please?

04:35:37.300 --> 04:35:42.300
When this item's public comment is over and the hearing is done.

04:35:42.300 --> 04:35:46.300
Okay, is fresh start up next?

04:35:46.300 --> 04:35:52.300
Yes, it's the next item, but unfortunately we don't have an idea what time that will

04:35:52.300 --> 04:35:53.300
be.

04:35:53.300 --> 04:35:54.300
Thank you.

04:35:54.300 --> 04:35:55.300
Okay.

04:35:55.300 --> 04:35:56.300
Thank you.

04:35:56.300 --> 04:35:57.300
Bye bye.

04:35:57.300 --> 04:36:04.300
Caller, did you wish to make a public comment for John Henry High?

04:36:04.300 --> 04:36:05.300

04:36:06.300 --> 04:36:08.300
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:36:08.300 --> 04:36:10.300
Your time starts now.

04:36:10.300 --> 04:36:11.300
Good afternoon.

04:36:11.300 --> 04:36:12.300
My name is Bianca Forrester.

04:36:12.300 --> 04:36:15.300
I'm the principal of Oakland Charter High School, John Henry Sister School.

04:36:15.300 --> 04:36:19.300
I have worked in public education, serving the most diverse and deserving students in

04:36:19.300 --> 04:36:21.300
the Bay Area for over 24 years.

04:36:21.300 --> 04:36:26.300
John Henry High School serves over 90% SES and minority students.

04:36:26.300 --> 04:36:30.300
Last year, John Henry was awarded a six-year WASC accreditation in no small part because

04:36:30.300 --> 04:36:35.300
the school provides a comprehensive college preparatory curriculum designed to prepare

04:36:35.300 --> 04:36:39.300
every student to meet the UC, CSU, A through G requirements.

04:36:39.300 --> 04:36:44.300
Over 90% of John Henry graduates have been accepted to a four-year college or university.

04:36:44.300 --> 04:36:48.300
Additionally, John Henry has outperformed all of the surrounding high schools in both

04:36:48.300 --> 04:36:53.300
English and math for all subgroups since the school began testing in 2017.

04:36:53.300 --> 04:36:57.300
The success of John Henry High School students in meeting the rigorous academic program

04:36:57.300 --> 04:37:01.300
offered, classes that strongly correlate with later success in college and beyond,

04:37:01.300 --> 04:37:05.300
illustrates why this school should be allowed to continue to equitably serve Richmond

04:37:05.300 --> 04:37:06.300
students and families.

04:37:06.300 --> 04:37:09.300
I urge you to vote in support of John Henry High School.

04:37:09.300 --> 04:37:15.300
Thank you very much.

04:37:15.300 --> 04:37:19.300
Next caller, did you wish to make a comment for John Henry?

04:37:19.300 --> 04:37:21.300
Yes, can you hear me?

04:37:21.300 --> 04:37:22.300
Yes, we can hear you.

04:37:22.300 --> 04:37:23.300
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:37:23.300 --> 04:37:26.300
Your time starts now.

04:37:26.300 --> 04:37:29.300
Hello, I am Natalie Garcia, one of the deans of instruction at John Henry High School

04:37:29.300 --> 04:37:31.300
and a Richmond resident.

04:37:31.300 --> 04:37:35.300
Amidst the worldwide pandemic and our current civil rights movement, we are living in uncertain

04:37:35.300 --> 04:37:39.300
times and it is precisely why it is crucial to keep John Henry High School, a law school

04:37:39.300 --> 04:37:43.300
accredited and nationally ranked high school by U.S. News, open for our schools and their

04:37:43.300 --> 04:37:44.300
families.

04:37:44.300 --> 04:37:47.300
It is a community hub offering resources, support, and academics among other things.

04:37:47.300 --> 04:37:49.300
You should not listen to all the naysayers calling in.

04:37:49.300 --> 04:37:53.300
We need teachers and adults who are spending their time to sabotage our school due to political

04:37:53.300 --> 04:37:54.300
allegiances.

04:37:54.300 --> 04:37:58.300
None of these loud naysayers have one step foot inside our learning community instead

04:37:58.300 --> 04:38:00.300
of making false accusations.

04:38:00.300 --> 04:38:03.300
West Contra Costa continues to dehumanize our students down to dollar bills as they scramble

04:38:03.300 --> 04:38:06.300
to figure out how to get out of their $50 million deficit.

04:38:06.300 --> 04:38:10.300
And false information is being disseminated even today, including during public comments

04:38:10.300 --> 04:38:13.300
to our president stating that I don't have a clear credential.

04:38:13.300 --> 04:38:16.300
Please check again because their credential is clear through 2024.

04:38:16.300 --> 04:38:20.300
Let me remind you John Henry is the best in Richmond and has received a recommendation

04:38:20.300 --> 04:38:21.300
from the ACFS board.

04:38:21.300 --> 04:38:25.300
Unfortunately, West Contra Costa has only offered failing and unsafe traditionally large

04:38:25.300 --> 04:38:28.300
public schools in our city of Richmond, and our families and students demand that this

04:38:28.300 --> 04:38:30.300
not be their only option.

04:38:30.300 --> 04:38:33.300
Please listen to the students, parents, and families who have elected John Henry as their

04:38:33.300 --> 04:38:35.300
choice for their educational experience.

04:38:35.300 --> 04:38:37.300
Don't get lost in all the smoke and mirror tactics.

04:38:37.300 --> 04:38:40.300
Please vote to renew John Henry High School's charter.

04:38:40.300 --> 04:38:41.300
Thank you.

04:38:45.300 --> 04:38:48.300
Next caller, did you wish to make public comment for John Henry High?

04:38:49.300 --> 04:38:50.300
Yeah, hello.

04:38:50.300 --> 04:38:51.300
Can you hear me?

04:38:51.300 --> 04:38:52.300
Yes, we can hear you.

04:38:52.300 --> 04:38:55.300
Please state your name and affiliation for the record and begin speaking.

04:38:56.300 --> 04:38:57.300
Okay.

04:38:57.300 --> 04:38:58.300
Good afternoon.

04:38:58.300 --> 04:39:01.300
My name is Kimberly Castro, a student at John Henry High.

04:39:01.300 --> 04:39:06.300
John Henry has provided all the John Henry community, including myself, a safe and positive

04:39:06.300 --> 04:39:10.300
environment that I know I won't experience at a public school.

04:39:10.300 --> 04:39:14.300
I believe this is an issue between political groups that we students should not be dragged

04:39:14.300 --> 04:39:16.300
into and taken our education away from.

04:39:16.300 --> 04:39:21.300
John Henry challenges you into doing your very best work and to honor that hard work.

04:39:21.300 --> 04:39:27.300
My sister attended a public school, and from what I've seen, she was doing very poorly

04:39:27.300 --> 04:39:30.300
because of the education given to her and the environment provided.

04:39:30.300 --> 04:39:35.300
At John Henry, I've noticed a dramatic change in her studies as well as her feeling safe.

04:39:35.300 --> 04:39:39.300
At John Henry, I feel safe, and the education provided is outstanding.

04:39:39.300 --> 04:39:41.300
Please don't take that away from all of us.

04:39:41.300 --> 04:39:42.300
Vote in favor of John Henry.

04:39:42.300 --> 04:39:43.300
Thank you for your time.

04:39:46.300 --> 04:39:54.300
Next caller, did you wish to provide public comment for John Henry?

04:40:00.300 --> 04:40:04.300
Next caller, did you wish to provide public comment for John Henry?

04:40:04.300 --> 04:40:05.300
Yes.

04:40:05.300 --> 04:40:08.300
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:40:08.300 --> 04:40:09.300
Your time starts now.

04:40:09.300 --> 04:40:10.300
Good evening.

04:40:10.300 --> 04:40:11.300
My name is Isora.

04:40:11.300 --> 04:40:15.300
I had the opportunity of attending Richmond Charter Academy for all three years in middle

04:40:15.300 --> 04:40:16.300
school.

04:40:16.300 --> 04:40:19.300
In my three years at the school, I learned so much through expanding my education.

04:40:19.300 --> 04:40:23.300
I experienced greater things than any other school in the area would have ever given me.

04:40:23.300 --> 04:40:27.300
Due to some changes in my life, I had to move high schools and was blessed enough to have

04:40:27.300 --> 04:40:29.300
landed in another great school.

04:40:29.300 --> 04:40:31.300
Unfortunately, that meant leaving my friends.

04:40:31.300 --> 04:40:35.300
With what this year has already brought us, I'm in shock and fear for the school, John

04:40:35.300 --> 04:40:36.300
Henry.

04:40:36.300 --> 04:40:39.300
Even though some of us were lucky enough to get out before all this happened, some of

04:40:39.300 --> 04:40:41.300
my former classmates are still at risk.

04:40:41.300 --> 04:40:44.300
The second option for them would be schools like Richmond High and Kennedy.

04:40:44.300 --> 04:40:49.300
Knowing this gives me a very unsettling feeling because so many good kids I know will be thrown

04:40:49.300 --> 04:40:52.300
into situations we all know of at other schools.

04:40:52.300 --> 04:40:56.300
This organization left me with a greater mindset for my future and left all of us feeling safe

04:40:56.300 --> 04:40:57.300
and set for what's ahead.

04:40:57.300 --> 04:41:02.300
So to know that this could all possibly go away gives me a great fear for the ones I

04:41:02.300 --> 04:41:03.300
left in love.

04:41:03.300 --> 04:41:04.300
Thank you.

04:41:04.300 --> 04:41:11.300
Next caller, did you wish to provide public comment for John Henry?

04:41:11.300 --> 04:41:22.300
Next caller, did you wish to provide public comment for John Henry?

04:41:22.300 --> 04:41:24.300
Yes, can you hear me?

04:41:24.300 --> 04:41:26.300
Yes, we can hear you.

04:41:26.300 --> 04:41:28.300
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:41:28.300 --> 04:41:30.300
Your time starts now.

04:41:30.300 --> 04:41:34.300
My name is Juan Navarro and I'm a former student from the graduating class of 2020.

04:41:34.300 --> 04:41:36.300
I have been part of AMS since seventh grade.

04:41:36.300 --> 04:41:40.300
All of the teachers that have taught me have given me their all to make sure that we all

04:41:40.300 --> 04:41:41.300
receive a good education.

04:41:41.300 --> 04:41:46.300
My primary language is Spanish and John Henry has done an amazing job in helping me.

04:41:46.300 --> 04:41:51.300
I am currently enrolled at a four-year university and receiving $20,000 in scholarships.

04:41:51.300 --> 04:41:56.300
This is all thanks to my amazing inner teacher Ken Kasake who spent multiple hours of his

04:41:56.300 --> 04:41:59.300
free time revising my essays and informing me of scholarships.

04:41:59.300 --> 04:42:03.300
I am a first generation student and this type of support will not be achievable in a public

04:42:03.300 --> 04:42:04.300
school.

04:42:04.300 --> 04:42:07.300
I am deeply saddened that people are trying to shut down John Henry High School.

04:42:07.300 --> 04:42:10.300
I have never witnessed the community that is present at John Henry.

04:42:10.300 --> 04:42:18.300
We cannot let these people sway you or blind you from the greatness that is within John Henry.

04:42:18.300 --> 04:42:25.300
Thank you.

04:42:25.300 --> 04:42:32.300
Next caller, did you wish to provide public comment for John Henry?

04:42:33.300 --> 04:42:56.300
Just a quick reminder, those in the call line, if you are waiting for the fresh start, please

04:42:56.300 --> 04:42:57.300
hang up.

04:42:58.300 --> 04:43:04.300
Once again, if you are waiting for the next item for a start, please hang up.

04:43:04.300 --> 04:43:08.300
These comments, if you are on the call line, are only for John Henry.

04:43:08.300 --> 04:43:20.300
John Henry, thank you.

04:43:20.300 --> 04:43:26.300
Next caller, did you wish to make a public comment for John Henry?

04:43:26.300 --> 04:43:27.300
Yes.

04:43:27.300 --> 04:43:29.300
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:43:29.300 --> 04:43:34.300
Your time starts now.

04:43:34.300 --> 04:43:35.300
Is this me?

04:43:35.300 --> 04:43:36.300
Can you hear me?

04:43:36.300 --> 04:43:38.300
Yes, we can hear you.

04:43:38.300 --> 04:43:39.300
Great, thank you.

04:43:39.300 --> 04:43:41.300
My name is Madeleine Cronenberg.

04:43:41.300 --> 04:43:48.300
I was serving on the West Contra Costa School Board as a trustee when John Henry was approved

04:43:48.300 --> 04:43:50.300
and I voted to approve it.

04:43:50.300 --> 04:44:00.300
I'm calling today because I am truly disappointed in how many violations they have had since

04:44:00.300 --> 04:44:02.300
the time of their approval.

04:44:02.300 --> 04:44:09.300
I understand that they have some strong teachers who serve their community well, but they have

04:44:09.300 --> 04:44:16.300
some very, very poor operations and governance procedures and that's why all these violations

04:44:16.300 --> 04:44:22.300
are out there and left for people to be victims of.

04:44:22.300 --> 04:44:28.300
It's really important that districts and schools not be allowed to treat employees and treat

04:44:28.300 --> 04:44:30.300
the rules the way they have done.

04:44:30.300 --> 04:44:36.300
So I please ask you now to look into that and to not allow the renewal to go forward.

04:44:36.300 --> 04:44:38.300
Thank you.

04:44:46.300 --> 04:44:50.300
Next caller, did you wish to provide public comment for John Henry?

04:44:50.300 --> 04:44:52.300
Yes.

04:44:52.300 --> 04:44:54.300
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:44:54.300 --> 04:44:56.300
Your time starts now.

04:44:56.300 --> 04:44:58.300
Hello.

04:44:58.300 --> 04:45:00.300
My name is Eduardo Martinez.

04:45:00.300 --> 04:45:04.300
I'm a Richmond City Council member as well as a retired elementary school teacher.

04:45:04.300 --> 04:45:08.300
I urge you not to renew the John Henry High School Charter.

04:45:08.300 --> 04:45:13.300
As a classroom teacher, I have found that the unspoken policy of calling problematic

04:45:13.300 --> 04:45:17.300
students from charter schools and casting them back into non-charter schools hinders

04:45:17.300 --> 04:45:22.300
the abilities of teachers working with students whose parents cannot advocate for their

04:45:22.300 --> 04:45:26.300
children and who end up in non-charter schools.

04:45:26.300 --> 04:45:32.300
Statistics illustrate that this is what is going on at John Henry High School.

04:45:32.300 --> 04:45:41.300
By looking at statistics, we can see that the, well, we can surmise that, anecdotally,

04:45:41.300 --> 04:45:46.300
the school may serve some students adequately but fails the community as a whole.

04:45:46.300 --> 04:45:51.300
We need schools that are inclusive in their ability to serve all students.

04:45:51.300 --> 04:45:54.300
This is not happening at John Henry.

04:45:54.300 --> 04:46:03.300
Thank you.

04:46:03.300 --> 04:46:07.300
Next caller, did you wish to provide a public comment on John Henry?

04:46:07.300 --> 04:46:09.300
Yes.

04:46:09.300 --> 04:46:14.300
Please state your name and affiliation for the record and begin speaking.

04:46:14.300 --> 04:46:20.300
My name is Suzanne Balmeseda and I'm asking you to please deny the petition of John Henry.

04:46:20.300 --> 04:46:23.300
I am a parent and a teacher in West Contra Costa.

04:46:23.300 --> 04:46:26.300
John Henry is not providing a strong academic program.

04:46:26.300 --> 04:46:31.300
Overall, their math scores are going down quickly, according to the California School Dashboard,

04:46:31.300 --> 04:46:36.300
and there are huge gaps between their Hispanic students and all other subgroups.

04:46:36.300 --> 04:46:43.300
Their college and career readiness scores are also declining, even though they supposedly focus on that at their school.

04:46:43.300 --> 04:46:48.300
John Henry has falsely claimed that they are a top high school in California,

04:46:48.300 --> 04:46:55.300
but according to U.S. News and World Report, they are actually number 746 in California.

04:46:55.300 --> 04:47:02.300
Several district schools are higher on the list and have higher graduation rates.

04:47:02.300 --> 04:47:06.300
They do not serve the same population of students as our district,

04:47:06.300 --> 04:47:12.300
and they do not do a good job of serving the few students from subgroups that they have.

04:47:12.300 --> 04:47:17.300
Compared to their nearest district schools, such as Kennedy High and Richmond High,

04:47:17.300 --> 04:47:23.300
John Henry serves significantly fewer English learners, special ed, and homeless foster students,

04:47:23.300 --> 04:47:25.300
and socially economically disadvantaged.

04:47:25.300 --> 04:47:29.300
Please do not renew John Henry, and they only have an 84% graduation rate last year.

04:47:29.300 --> 04:47:36.300
Thank you.

04:47:36.300 --> 04:47:40.300
Next caller, did you wish to provide public comment for John Henry?

04:47:40.300 --> 04:47:41.300
Yes.

04:47:41.300 --> 04:47:45.300
Please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

04:47:45.300 --> 04:47:50.300
Hi, I'm Richard Peregrina, and I am going to be a senior next year at John Henry.

04:47:50.300 --> 04:47:55.300
There hasn't been one year of my high school experience that I have not had to fight for my school,

04:47:55.300 --> 04:47:59.300
and yet if I had to pick either Kennedy or RHS high school experience,

04:47:59.300 --> 04:48:02.300
I would rather fight for John Henry all over again.

04:48:02.300 --> 04:48:04.300
So please keep my school open.

04:48:04.300 --> 04:48:12.300
And to the lady that said something about our school being racist and such,

04:48:12.300 --> 04:48:15.300
I guarantee you that's the exact opposite.

04:48:15.300 --> 04:48:18.300
And that's all. Thank you.

04:48:45.300 --> 04:48:49.300
Please state your name and affiliation and begin speaking.

04:48:49.300 --> 04:48:54.300
Hello, my name is Missy Perez-Caro. I am a homegrown educator in Richmond, California.

04:48:54.300 --> 04:49:00.300
I work at my local WCC high school, about a mile from John Henry, named Kennedy High School.

04:49:00.300 --> 04:49:05.300
I plead you to hear the voice of the community, your students, families, educators that are asking you

04:49:05.300 --> 04:49:08.300
to reinvest into the schools that already exist here.

04:49:08.300 --> 04:49:14.300
I am humbly requesting that you let the students come to schools like Kennedy High, Richmond High, or De Anza High.

04:49:14.300 --> 04:49:17.300
These schools will welcome these students and families with open arms.

04:49:17.300 --> 04:49:29.300
We want more students to be a part of programs or academies like information technology, media, law, health, theater, international, many more.

04:49:29.300 --> 04:49:32.300
If they are interested in trades, they can work in wood shop or welding.

04:49:32.300 --> 04:49:40.300
If they enjoy electives such as art, Kennedy has an amazing silk screening program that would be a great experience for them.

04:49:40.300 --> 04:49:45.300
They have a promising future at our neighboring schools, and I would like to invite them to join.

04:49:45.300 --> 04:49:58.300
And I implore you to deny John Henry High School. Thank you.

04:49:58.300 --> 04:50:06.300
Next caller. Did you wish to provide public comment for John Henry?

04:50:06.300 --> 04:50:16.300
Next caller, would you like to provide public comment for John Henry?

04:50:16.300 --> 04:50:20.300
Next caller, would you like to provide public comment for John Henry?

04:50:20.300 --> 04:50:21.300
Yes.

04:50:21.300 --> 04:50:26.300
Please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

04:50:26.300 --> 04:50:29.300
My name is Miss Duguay, and I'm a credential John Henry teacher and Richmond resident.

04:50:29.300 --> 04:50:37.300
John Henry admits to areas of growth, but the dashboard shows we have the highest percentage of ELL students progressing towards proficiency in the district.

04:50:37.300 --> 04:50:42.300
And 71% of our student body are former ELLs redesignated as proficient.

04:50:42.300 --> 04:50:46.300
We were issued a letter of good standing from the district in November 2018.

04:50:46.300 --> 04:50:51.300
So old grievances need to be set aside so we can focus on these students' bright future.

04:50:51.300 --> 04:50:58.300
Even today, the district compared our academic data with statewide averages instead of the surrounding schools that our students would otherwise attend.

04:50:58.300 --> 04:51:06.300
The only time the district keeps it local is when looking at demographics because switching these lenses strategically supports their false narrative.

04:51:06.300 --> 04:51:12.300
We do not have a selective admissions process, but we are a notoriously rigorous college preparatory program.

04:51:12.300 --> 04:51:18.300
And we take the students who come to us who, by the way, are over 90% socioeconomically disadvantaged minority students.

04:51:18.300 --> 04:51:22.300
Low African-American enrollment is a tragic charters issue, not a John Henry issue.

04:51:22.300 --> 04:51:27.300
And Miss Flores is fighting tooth and nail to make John Henry a leader in changing the disturbing trend.

04:51:27.300 --> 04:51:37.300
Cut through the noise. Vote John Henry. Thank you.

04:51:37.300 --> 04:51:42.300
Next caller, did you wish to provide a public comment for John Henry?

04:51:42.300 --> 04:51:43.300

Please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

04:51:48.300 --> 04:51:54.300
Hello, my name is Stephanie De La Cruz. I'm a student at John Henry High School.

04:51:54.300 --> 04:52:02.300
I wanted to say that the John Henry High School is a very secure place.

04:52:02.300 --> 04:52:09.300
I've been part of AMPS for five years. Thanks to John Henry, I was able to get a program,

04:52:09.300 --> 04:52:16.300
enter a program at the University of San Francisco.

04:52:16.300 --> 04:52:27.300
As the oldest sibling, I wanted John Henry to stay open so that my younger siblings would be able to attend.

04:52:27.300 --> 04:52:43.300
So please do not close down the school. Thank you.

04:52:43.300 --> 04:52:48.300
Next caller, did you wish to provide public comment for John Henry?

04:52:48.300 --> 04:52:49.300
Yes, please.

Please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

04:52:53.300 --> 04:52:58.300
Hi, my name is Art Orencila. I'm calling on behalf of Defend Public Education Now,

04:52:58.300 --> 04:53:02.300
and we are asking the board to deny John Henry's application.

04:53:02.300 --> 04:53:09.300
We are asking you to respect the district's denial and the county's denial.

04:53:09.300 --> 04:53:14.300
These denials did not come easy. There was a lot of hard work put into them.

04:53:14.300 --> 04:53:20.300
And I applaud the teachers and the members of John Henry for trying to save their school.

04:53:20.300 --> 04:53:34.300
But the facts are the facts, and we're asking you to deny John Henry's renewal. Thank you.

04:53:34.300 --> 04:53:45.300
Next caller, did you wish to provide public comment for John Henry?

04:53:56.300 --> 04:54:00.300
Next caller, did you wish to provide public comment for John Henry?

04:54:00.300 --> 04:54:02.300
Yes, please.

04:54:02.300 --> 04:54:07.300
Please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

04:54:07.300 --> 04:54:14.300
My name is Madeline Lozada. I was an ESL student, now reclassified as a speaker,

04:54:14.300 --> 04:54:19.300
as a speaker of English, thanks to John Henry High School.

04:54:19.300 --> 04:54:25.300
I'm so happy to be there, and I don't want the school to close because I'm so sad about it.

04:54:25.300 --> 04:54:42.300
And also, they have so many programs like AB programs, and please, I really wanted to stay open. Thank you.

04:54:42.300 --> 04:54:46.300
Next caller, did you wish to provide public comment for John Henry?

04:54:46.300 --> 04:54:55.300
Yes, please.

04:54:55.300 --> 04:55:04.300
One moment, caller, while we get the translator on the line.

04:55:04.300 --> 04:55:10.300
Translator, are you available?

04:55:10.300 --> 04:55:20.300
Translator, are you available?

04:55:20.300 --> 04:55:26.300
Translator, are you available?

04:55:32.300 --> 04:55:34.300
Translator, are you available?

04:55:34.300 --> 04:55:36.300
Translator, are you available?

04:55:36.300 --> 04:55:40.300
Hello, I'm online.

04:55:40.300 --> 04:55:44.300
Did the caller wish to make public comment on John Henry?

04:55:44.300 --> 04:55:49.300
Do you wish to make public comment on John Henry?

04:55:49.300 --> 04:55:51.300
Yes, please.

04:55:51.300 --> 04:55:53.300
Yes, please.

04:55:53.300 --> 04:55:57.300
Please state your name and affiliation and begin your public comment. You have one minute.

04:55:57.300 --> 04:56:01.300
Say your name and affiliation and start with your public comment. You have one minute.

04:56:01.300 --> 04:56:03.300
Good afternoon, thank you very much.

04:56:03.300 --> 04:56:05.300
My name is Richard Luzada.

04:56:05.300 --> 04:56:10.300
I am a proud father and I have my daughter who attends John Henry High School.

04:56:10.300 --> 04:56:16.300
If you don't know, John Henry High School is in the top group of the best schools in Richmond.

04:56:16.300 --> 04:56:21.300
And please, it makes no sense to close our school.

04:56:21.300 --> 04:56:25.300
My daughter finished learning English thanks to this school.

04:56:25.300 --> 04:56:30.300
Please consider the great education that staff provides here in this school.

04:56:30.300 --> 04:56:32.300
She is in this John Henry High School.

04:56:32.300 --> 04:56:35.300
She has found good AP classes and honors.

04:56:35.300 --> 04:56:37.300
She is a very good student.

04:56:37.300 --> 04:56:41.300
She has everything. She is a student who has pure A.

04:56:41.300 --> 04:56:49.300
Please remember that having an opportunity to attend a good high school makes the difference to go to a good university.

04:56:49.300 --> 04:56:58.300
I am also sure that you know very well the difference that there is here in places of little money like Richmond

04:56:58.300 --> 04:57:01.300
compared to areas that have more money.

04:57:01.300 --> 04:57:03.300
So it's not fair.

04:57:03.300 --> 04:57:08.300
Time. Translator, would you please provide feedback?

04:57:08.300 --> 04:57:10.300
Time is up.

04:57:10.300 --> 04:57:13.300
Good afternoon. Yes. Good afternoon. My name is Richard Luzada.

04:57:13.300 --> 04:57:15.300
I am the proud father of a daughter attending John Henry.

04:57:15.300 --> 04:57:18.300
John Henry is one of the top schools in Richmond.

04:57:18.300 --> 04:57:20.300
It doesn't make sense to close it.

04:57:20.300 --> 04:57:23.300
She just finished learning English thanks to this school.

04:57:23.300 --> 04:57:25.300
Please consider John Henry.

04:57:25.300 --> 04:57:27.300
The staff, education, everything is good.

04:57:27.300 --> 04:57:31.300
IEP, the classes, and my daughter is a straight A student.

04:57:31.300 --> 04:57:35.300
Please give it the opportunity to continue with this good school.

04:57:35.300 --> 04:57:39.300
You know that going to a good school makes a difference to getting to college or not.

04:57:39.300 --> 04:57:47.300
And especially here in Richmond, there is a difference between schools versus other areas.

04:57:47.300 --> 04:57:49.300
Please consider John Henry.

04:57:56.300 --> 04:57:59.300
Next caller, did you wish to provide public comment for John Henry?

04:58:03.300 --> 04:58:06.300
Caller on the line, would you like to provide public comment for John Henry?

04:58:13.300 --> 04:58:16.300
Next caller, would you like to provide public comment for John Henry?

Your time starts now.

04:58:24.300 --> 04:58:26.300
One moment and we'll get the translator.

04:58:26.300 --> 04:58:27.300
Okay.

04:58:29.300 --> 04:58:34.300
Yes, please state your name and affiliation for public comment.

04:58:36.300 --> 04:58:38.300
Look, my name is Alejo Sabina.

04:58:38.300 --> 04:58:40.300
I am calling for John Henry School.

04:58:40.300 --> 04:58:44.300
I don't want this school to close because this is where my son is learning.

04:58:44.300 --> 04:58:50.300
He is going to enter the 10th grade and he is learning a lot in this school.

04:58:50.300 --> 04:58:52.300
I would like to not close this school.

04:58:52.300 --> 04:58:55.300
I ask the senior staff to not close this school.

04:58:55.300 --> 04:59:02.300
So, that is what I want, not to close it because this is where my son is getting more qualifications,

04:59:02.300 --> 04:59:06.300
he is learning more in this school than in other schools.

04:59:06.300 --> 04:59:08.300
Thank you very much.

04:59:12.300 --> 04:59:14.300
Yes, my name is Alejo Salinas.

04:59:14.300 --> 04:59:17.300
My son is a student at John Henry.

04:59:17.300 --> 04:59:19.300
He is learning a lot at this school.

04:59:19.300 --> 04:59:24.300
I beg you to please not close this school because he is learning a lot there.

04:59:24.300 --> 04:59:26.300
Please don't close it.

04:59:26.300 --> 04:59:27.300
Thank you.

04:59:35.300 --> 04:59:40.300
Next caller, did you wish to provide public comment for John Henry High?

04:59:40.300 --> 04:59:43.300
Next caller, would you like to provide public comment for John Henry?

04:59:47.300 --> 04:59:49.300
Next caller, would you like to provide public comment for John Henry?

04:59:56.300 --> 05:00:00.300
Next caller, would you like to provide public comment for John Henry?

05:00:00.300 --> 05:00:12.060
John Henry? Caller on the line would you like to provide public comment for John Henry?

05:00:13.580 --> 05:00:17.820
Yes. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:00:20.700 --> 05:00:26.940
Hello my name is Rosa Kuriel. Good afternoon board members. I am here to support John Henry.

05:00:26.940 --> 05:00:32.300
I am representing six families that were not able to attend the call. John Henry is important

05:00:32.300 --> 05:00:37.900
to our community, our Latino community. John Henry has provided the students with higher

05:00:37.900 --> 05:00:43.740
education and has offered a way to go to college and universities. Our seniors have been accepted

05:00:43.740 --> 05:00:51.340
to UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC San Francisco, along with others. Our district says that they're ready for

05:00:51.340 --> 05:00:57.500
our students. So they have a 48 million deficit. How do they plan to provide a quality education

05:00:57.500 --> 05:01:04.460
to our students? I'm appalled to hear the teachers union calling to close the school.

05:01:05.020 --> 05:01:10.300
They have not provided, they have failed our students and they continue to fail our students.

05:01:10.300 --> 05:01:15.820
That's why there's so much learning gap in between. We need a quality school. John Henry,

05:01:15.820 --> 05:01:19.980
that's what is providing our families, our Latino families. Time.

05:01:27.020 --> 05:01:33.740
Just a quick reminder, anyone still remaining on the phone line, this is only for John Henry.

05:01:34.300 --> 05:01:41.100
Again, this is for only for item 20, which is John Henry. All others need to hang up and call

05:01:41.100 --> 05:01:51.020
back when that item is read. Thank you. Did you wish to provide public comment for John Henry?

05:01:53.740 --> 05:01:57.980
Hello? Yes, we can hear you. Did you wish to provide public comment?

05:01:59.100 --> 05:02:05.580
Yes, ma'am. My name is Jorge Lopez. My name is Jorge Lopez and I am the founder of AMPS,

05:02:05.580 --> 05:02:10.300
the oldest charter school system in the East Bay. And perhaps more importantly,

05:02:10.300 --> 05:02:15.660
I am born and raised in Richmond and raised in West Contra Costa schools. I became an educator

05:02:15.660 --> 05:02:19.580
due to my experiences in Richmond schools, especially due to being expelled from Richmond

05:02:19.580 --> 05:02:25.580
high school without due process simply because my mother did not speak English. I agree with

05:02:25.580 --> 05:02:30.860
that public schools need to serve all kids. So if we look at West Contra Costa academic

05:02:30.860 --> 05:02:35.100
achievement through the history, and I mean decades and generations of families, you will see

05:02:35.100 --> 05:02:42.540
that black and brown kids have been severely mis-served in the West Contra Costa schools.

05:02:42.540 --> 05:02:47.740
So just because kids are in the building does not mean that they are being served. Black and brown

05:02:47.740 --> 05:02:53.580
poor students of Richmond deserve a shot at better outcomes of college. JHHS is one of those pathways

05:02:53.580 --> 05:02:58.940
to a better future. If you look at the transitions in the West Contra Costa Unified School District,

05:02:58.940 --> 05:03:05.100
you will see also so much turnover with three associate superintendents terminated,

05:03:05.100 --> 05:03:11.660
two superintendents, one a lame duck. You will also see a chief academic officer resignation,

05:03:11.660 --> 05:03:18.620
two SPED directors in three years. You will also see a HR resource associate superintendent also.

05:03:18.620 --> 05:03:23.820
Time. So what's good for the goose is good for the gander. Keep JHHS open for the families of

05:03:23.820 --> 05:03:41.660
Richmond, for family, community, and for equity. Next caller, did you wish to provide public comment

05:03:41.660 --> 05:03:50.780
for John Henry? Caller on the line, did you wish to provide public comment for John Henry?

05:03:53.820 --> 05:04:01.420
Caller on the line, did you wish to provide public comment for John Henry?

05:04:08.140 --> 05:04:18.780
Did you wish to provide public comment?

05:04:23.820 --> 05:04:34.860
Yes. Caller, did you wish to provide public comment on John Henry?

05:04:36.300 --> 05:04:40.220
Yes. Thank you. Please state your name and affiliation for the record and begin speaking.

05:04:40.220 --> 05:04:51.020
Your time starts now. My name is Lucy and I'm a 9th grader at John Henry High School. I just want

05:04:51.020 --> 05:04:59.820
to say that John Henry is a good school that supports their students and they want their

05:04:59.820 --> 05:05:08.460
students to go higher than they already are. I'm a student that is recently at the University of

05:05:08.460 --> 05:05:16.940
Art and I really want to support the school. Thank you.

05:05:23.580 --> 05:05:26.460
Next caller, did you wish to provide public comment for John Henry?

05:05:30.380 --> 05:05:34.540
Hello. Yes, we can hear you. Did you wish to provide public comment for John Henry?

05:05:34.620 --> 05:05:37.500
Yes. Your time starts now.

05:05:41.340 --> 05:05:46.300
My name is Carlos Taboada. I'm a retired teacher with 20 years experience in our district

05:05:47.020 --> 05:05:56.780
and I think I want to request this board not to renew John Henry's charter. They have had five

05:05:56.780 --> 05:06:03.500
years, five years and that's enough time. They do not deserve another chance. They talk a lot about

05:06:04.380 --> 05:06:11.260
English learners that they have but they fail to tell you that not one student was redesigned

05:06:11.820 --> 05:06:20.540
fluent English proficient. Also, they have a tremendously high turnover rate in teachers.

05:06:20.540 --> 05:06:27.020
Currently they are trying to recruit 10 teachers and yet in their job description they do not

05:06:27.020 --> 05:06:35.180
mention the requirement of a teaching credential. It's time that we, this community, get together

05:06:35.820 --> 05:06:42.940
and support our democratically controlled system of education. You must remember that

05:06:42.940 --> 05:06:48.540
our school board denied the charter. Time. Please. Thank you.

05:06:57.100 --> 05:06:59.980
Next caller, did you wish to provide public comment for John Henry?

05:07:02.060 --> 05:07:08.460
Yes. My name is Conception and I have a daughter in John Henry and I really appreciate this call

05:07:08.460 --> 05:07:15.580
because my daughter is having their engraved straight A and I really like it because teachers

05:07:15.580 --> 05:07:23.580
have been improving a lot and they always focus and they do their homework and time so this is

05:07:23.580 --> 05:07:29.180
something that I really love because they care about them and I also, the behavior and the

05:07:29.180 --> 05:07:35.340
environment is really good. It's safe. So this is why I would like you keep John Henry open.

05:07:35.980 --> 05:07:36.940
Thank you so much.

05:07:42.060 --> 05:07:44.780
Next caller, did you wish to provide public comment for John Henry?

05:07:51.420 --> 05:07:56.540
Yes. Please state your name and affiliation for the record and begin speaking. Your time starts now.

05:07:56.940 --> 05:08:03.660
Hi, my name is Ajanta Dey and this is my seventh year at OCHS, which is the sister school of John

05:08:03.660 --> 05:08:11.260
Henry. During these years, AMS has nothing been much supportive and always been very inclusive of

05:08:11.820 --> 05:08:20.380
the staff population, which is one of the concerns which keeps coming, I see, and I do not understand

05:08:20.700 --> 05:08:26.140
do not understand why John Henry is being closed down because I have all a lot of times

05:08:26.140 --> 05:08:33.420
collaborated with their staff for student support and they have supported their students to the

05:08:33.420 --> 05:08:41.420
best of their abilities and the leaders work as hard as no other school. For last two years,

05:08:41.420 --> 05:08:49.340
this commotion about if it's getting closed or open is creating a lot of problems in our community

05:08:49.420 --> 05:08:56.460
and I hope that you would take our problem under consideration and think about the student

05:08:56.460 --> 05:09:07.900
population. Thank you in support of John Henry. At this time, we have no additional callers and

05:09:07.900 --> 05:09:13.180
the caller Q&A and no additional callers for John Henry High on the participant line.

05:09:13.180 --> 05:09:26.060
Thank you very much. At this point, before we get into public discussion among the board members,

05:09:26.060 --> 05:09:36.300
I'm going to bring a close of adjourn the close the public hearing at 2 49 p.m. I'm going to

05:09:37.100 --> 05:09:42.380
encourage us to take a 10-minute break so that people can be prepared for the next part of the

05:09:42.380 --> 05:09:48.540
conversation, get a cup of coffee, whatever you need, and we'll resume at 3 p.m.

05:09:56.940 --> 05:09:59.740
All right, let's see who we have back here.

05:09:59.980 --> 05:10:05.740
I see Eileen and Idae, Jim, Brenna, Cynthia, Ting.

05:10:08.300 --> 05:10:16.060
Kim will be back in a little while perhaps. All right, and I understand, Karen, do you need to

05:10:16.060 --> 05:10:23.100
call the roll again? Yes, I will call the roll again. And then we can see if Patricia's available

05:10:23.660 --> 05:10:34.300
to vote. Okay. So, Linda, you're obviously here. I'm talking to you. Cynthia? Yes. Here. Jim?

05:10:37.980 --> 05:10:39.420
Yes, here. Matt?

05:10:42.220 --> 05:10:46.940
Here. Brenna? Here. Kim?

05:10:46.940 --> 05:11:11.740
Here. Idae? Here. Eileen? Eileen? Here. Okay. Ting? Here. Okay. And then, Patricia Rucker?

05:11:12.700 --> 05:11:14.140
Here? Yay!

05:11:22.300 --> 05:11:27.020
All right. So, I think we want to ask you, Patricia, while we have you, and we hope you'll

05:11:27.020 --> 05:11:36.860
stay with us, to cast your vote on the previous charter school item on the Time Community School.

05:11:37.740 --> 05:11:44.300
Okay, I do want to confirm that I did receive a written copy of the motion that was proposed

05:11:44.300 --> 05:11:51.180
by Board Member San. As I understand what was written in the document I received, I will vote

05:11:51.180 --> 05:11:58.300
reluctantly yes. Okay. Thank you. You voted yes, so the motion passes, Linda.

05:11:59.100 --> 05:12:05.740
All right. So, we will now move on to, we can take that off the screen, and we will move on to

05:12:05.740 --> 05:12:15.980
discussion on John Henry, and I'm going to turn to Ting first as our liaison for framing.

05:12:17.420 --> 05:12:24.860
So, just I wanted to thank all the members of the community who called in and spoke on

05:12:25.580 --> 05:12:33.660
John Henry, both for and not for the renewal, and I know that with these charter renewals,

05:12:33.660 --> 05:12:40.940
unlike the new charter petitions we looked at earlier, these charters come with history

05:12:40.940 --> 05:12:47.660
and varying perspectives of that history, and often they come with a lot of emotion and passion.

05:12:48.220 --> 05:13:01.180
And so, again, just, you know, it is always helpful to hear from the public, and I just wanted to

05:13:01.180 --> 05:13:07.900
commend those who called in, and especially the students who called in and advocated for their

05:13:07.900 --> 05:13:15.500
school. And then from here, I just have the board members address, have any questions they have on

05:13:15.500 --> 05:13:22.780
the charter. All right. Well, we will start our discussion. There were a lot of questions

05:13:22.780 --> 05:13:29.100
raised, so I'm sure we will have many we want to explore. I did want to begin the conversation by

05:13:29.100 --> 05:13:37.020
treating one issue that came up, which was the question about the performance of English learners

05:13:37.020 --> 05:13:43.500
at the school. And just to point out that the English learner category is this unusual category.

05:13:44.060 --> 05:13:53.340
As students gain proficiency, they leave the category. So, having your best students

05:13:54.060 --> 05:14:00.460
reclassified at a high rate often means that the students remaining in that category

05:14:01.100 --> 05:14:09.420
have lower scores because they're reclassifying at a high rate. And we did see that in this

05:14:10.140 --> 05:14:16.620
charter school, the 90-plus percent of students who began as English learners and the 70-plus

05:14:16.620 --> 05:14:24.380
percent proficient reclassification rate means that English learners are doing well in the school

05:14:24.380 --> 05:14:30.300
and becoming reclassified. Those remaining in the English learner category are a smaller number

05:14:31.020 --> 05:14:37.340
because of the reclassification of others and may have lower scores because those with better

05:14:37.340 --> 05:14:43.500
scores are moving out of the category. So, that's something that we could illustrate statistically.

05:14:43.580 --> 05:14:49.580
It's an unusual aspect of that subgroup and understanding their performance, but it seems

05:14:49.580 --> 05:14:55.020
very important to understand that in this particular case. There are a lot of other

05:14:55.020 --> 05:15:03.980
questions that came up that I think we will want to explore about the treatment of students in

05:15:03.980 --> 05:15:11.500
special education, their recruitment policies, and suspension and expulsion policies. And I would love

05:15:11.500 --> 05:15:19.980
to get back to those agenda items at some point. I do want to open it up to other board members

05:15:19.980 --> 05:15:24.380
who have questions that they'd like to get on the table, but I wanted to start with that

05:15:24.380 --> 05:15:31.340
clarification so that we can move on to the other set of pressing items that have been raised.

05:15:32.060 --> 05:15:42.860
So, do I see any board members ready to hand one up? Yes, Vice President Strauss.

05:15:46.860 --> 05:15:55.500
I have several comments and clarifying questions. It may be that other board members are wondering

05:15:55.500 --> 05:16:00.460
some of the same things, so I won't do all of them. I'll do some and then see if other board

05:16:00.460 --> 05:16:07.340
members have some and then come back. First, let me just say I think this was, I think John Henry

05:16:07.340 --> 05:16:13.420
provides an opportunity for students in the community, and we heard from the students and

05:16:13.420 --> 05:16:21.420
the parents, that's meeting a need. And I felt that strongly and I believe that that's important

05:16:22.060 --> 05:16:30.540
to consider. However, I think the concerns that were raised in the denial and in the comments

05:16:30.540 --> 05:16:37.420
are worth exploring, and I have several concerns. So, and I have an interesting question. So,

05:16:37.420 --> 05:16:45.580
first, let me ask the petitioner. So, if this petition is not approved, the students will not

05:16:45.580 --> 05:16:51.740
the students will not go to school this fall at John Henry. So, what plans have you made

05:16:52.300 --> 05:16:59.100
to support students knowing that we're in July and schools likely to open in a month? What

05:16:59.100 --> 05:17:05.820
communication and plans have been made? Because at this point, it's denied unless it is approved

05:17:05.820 --> 05:17:12.300
here. So, I just wonder what you've done to think about that. Are you addressing that to the district

05:17:12.380 --> 05:17:26.860
or to the petitioner? Hi. Thank you. Yeah, thank you for the question. So, in March when we received

05:17:27.980 --> 05:17:37.340
the decision from the county to not hear our petition, and when they told us that we have

05:17:37.340 --> 05:17:45.820
to go straight to the state board, I told my families that they needed to have a plan B,

05:17:45.820 --> 05:17:53.820
an option if John Henry doesn't renew. Since then, we've been supporting families in trying to

05:17:54.540 --> 05:17:59.660
enroll at other schools. Most of our families want to enroll at other charter schools,

05:17:59.740 --> 05:18:07.340
but by then it was March. Most charter schools did not have any space. They had very long

05:18:07.340 --> 05:18:14.060
waiting lists. The school closest to us, leadership public schools, they had a waiting list of over,

05:18:14.060 --> 05:18:19.420
I think it was 75 students. So, they told us, you know what, we're most likely not going to be able

05:18:19.420 --> 05:18:25.900
to accept any of your transfer students. So, we also helped them with the applications for the

05:18:25.900 --> 05:18:32.540
district schools. However, at that time, the pandemic hit and the transfer office was closed

05:18:32.540 --> 05:18:39.500
for several weeks at the district. We directed them online and we helped them with the online

05:18:39.500 --> 05:18:47.260
applications, but our families continue wanting to enroll at John Henry for next year. So,

05:18:47.260 --> 05:18:53.660
they told us that even though some of them have found another school, most of them haven't yet.

05:18:53.660 --> 05:19:00.220
They either haven't received an offer from a school. A lot of them have told us that they're

05:19:00.220 --> 05:19:09.180
going to pursue private schools or online schools if John Henry doesn't renew. And we've started to

05:19:09.180 --> 05:19:16.540
make calls after the ACCS recommended for approval. We began making calls to ask what their status was.

05:19:16.540 --> 05:19:24.380
Have they found another school? And like I said, some of them had, but the majority of them said

05:19:24.380 --> 05:19:31.660
that they were considering online options. Some were even told that if they wanted a small school

05:19:31.660 --> 05:19:37.580
within the district, that they could look at Greenwood Academy, which is a continuation school.

05:19:38.620 --> 05:19:44.060
And in terms of the families wanting to stay here, we've had several town halls throughout

05:19:44.060 --> 05:19:51.420
the summer and we started that in May. And they keep wanting to stay at John Henry. So,

05:19:52.220 --> 05:19:57.820
like I said, some of them have found an option, most of them haven't. I would say about 70% of

05:19:57.820 --> 05:20:07.260
them are still in limbo basically. So, let me just follow up with the district. If this charter is not

05:20:07.260 --> 05:20:13.020
renewed, what would be the process for supporting these students, particularly as the transition

05:20:13.020 --> 05:20:19.820
and how difficult the times are now? Hi there. This is Dr. Linda Delgado. I will start to answer

05:20:19.820 --> 05:20:25.580
that and I may lob the rest of the question to Mr. Ruben Aurelio, who's also on the line.

05:20:26.860 --> 05:20:34.060
We did write up a one-pager. Actually, the district has been engaged in preparation

05:20:34.060 --> 05:20:41.340
for welcoming the students back when the initial petition was refused in the district.

05:20:41.900 --> 05:20:51.020
So, we have prepared well, I believe, to welcome students back. I can clarify too that there is

05:20:51.660 --> 05:20:59.420
another option for students who prefer a small school and that would be Vista Independent Study

05:20:59.420 --> 05:21:05.740
High School, one of our district schools. And also, I'm going to mention that all of our larger

05:21:05.740 --> 05:21:11.820
comprehensive high schools have a program called academies, which you're probably familiar with,

05:21:11.820 --> 05:21:18.700
Linked Learning Academies of Learning. And they enable us to take a high school of 1,500 or so

05:21:18.700 --> 05:21:25.740
students and break those kids into smaller groups. So, if the students were to, say, attend Richmond

05:21:25.740 --> 05:21:32.300
High School, they would be in a cohort that's about 150 students and they would move through

05:21:32.300 --> 05:21:38.780
most of their classwork with that same cohort of students. So, it offers the benefits of

05:21:38.780 --> 05:21:45.260
a large school but the crowd size of a small school. Thank you. And I'm just going to ask

05:21:45.260 --> 05:21:51.900
the petitioner. My understanding is there was a notice of violation in 2018, so almost two years

05:21:51.900 --> 05:21:59.340
ago. And now we're at 2020 and I'm just wondering what you did to address the notice of violation

05:21:59.340 --> 05:22:08.220
at that time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, we entered into a resolution agreement with the district

05:22:08.220 --> 05:22:17.100
and in November of 2018 we received a letter from Mr. Matt Duffy, who's the superintendent for the

05:22:17.100 --> 05:22:25.500
district, a letter of good standing, meaning that we had addressed these violations or these concerns

05:22:25.500 --> 05:22:32.540
on the resolution agreement. So, ever since then we've had to submit several documents to the

05:22:32.540 --> 05:22:38.940
district. We had to submit our credentialing status every quarter. We had to submit

05:22:40.060 --> 05:22:46.620
plans for professional development and we have not received any letter of concern,

05:22:46.620 --> 05:22:50.460
any complaint from the district since we received that letter of good standing.

05:22:51.340 --> 05:22:57.820
In the resolution it stated that if there was any concern, Amps and West Contra Costa would meet

05:22:57.820 --> 05:23:07.260
and confirm if any issue arose. And so far we haven't had any issue arise. We haven't had any

05:23:08.060 --> 05:23:16.300
requests for a meeting and we've been serving students well. So, Dr. Delgado, you and your

05:23:16.300 --> 05:23:23.180
presentation actually appeared to challenge and listed quite a bit of violations. So,

05:23:23.180 --> 05:23:29.580
do you believe that the John Henry High had addressed the notice of violation and is in

05:23:29.580 --> 05:23:36.460
good standing or did you believe that that wasn't true? I believe that they did the very best they

05:23:36.460 --> 05:23:44.060
could back when things were due, back when various submissions were due as per the agreement.

05:23:44.940 --> 05:23:51.740
The gentleman who led most of that charge is no longer with the organization. So,

05:23:53.100 --> 05:23:59.980
I think some institutional knowledge was lost. So far as the concerns that were called out on the

05:23:59.980 --> 05:24:07.100
notice of violation, special education was one and as you heard from the presentation today continues

05:24:07.100 --> 05:24:12.540
to be a concern with the district. They're among our most vulnerable students and they are students

05:24:12.540 --> 05:24:22.220
who we are keenly attached to protecting. Also around credentialing, there has continued to be

05:24:22.220 --> 05:24:30.860
quite a bit of turnover at that particular school as well as the other two schools in the district.

05:24:30.860 --> 05:24:38.300
So, I would say credentialing continues to be a concern. Let's see, I think I'll leave it at that

05:24:38.300 --> 05:24:45.180
for now. Oh and so far as we there were some communications with the school surrounding

05:24:45.180 --> 05:24:51.580
questions such as provision of free and reduced lunch. Apparently there was something in the

05:24:51.580 --> 05:24:59.900
handbook and paper disseminated to parents saying that there would be a penalty if free and reduced

05:24:59.900 --> 05:25:09.260
lunch were or if parents were not current with their lunch bill, report cards would be withheld

05:25:09.260 --> 05:25:15.660
and things like that. So, there have been some communications back and forth of the district

05:25:15.660 --> 05:25:23.260
endeavoring to notify the school when there are issues and work with them as best we can.

05:25:23.260 --> 05:25:27.340
Thank you. So, I have one more question and then I'll leave it to my other board members. I'm sure

05:25:27.340 --> 05:25:33.660
there are more. To the petitioner again, there was a concern about obviously your demographics

05:25:33.660 --> 05:25:40.860
not representing the local community and concern about your admission require priorities

05:25:40.860 --> 05:25:48.460
which have been changed from your original petition to give priority to. So, that doesn't fit

05:25:48.460 --> 05:25:56.380
with what you said you would do to address the lack of representation of certain groups. So,

05:25:56.380 --> 05:26:03.260
how do you address the issue of the admission priorities considering that the population is not

05:26:03.260 --> 05:26:11.100
as reflective as it is supposed to be? Yeah, thank you. You're right. We haven't had

05:26:11.740 --> 05:26:19.340
the preference for students coming from an AMP school in the past. The reason why we decided

05:26:19.340 --> 05:26:25.340
to add that to this petition is because our elementary, middle and high school are on the

05:26:25.340 --> 05:26:36.460
same block. They're right next to each other. So, we wanted to have a K-12 system and right now,

05:26:36.460 --> 05:26:42.700
I mean, we've been working on this recruitment outreach plan because we do want to diversify our

05:26:42.700 --> 05:26:49.660
school. It's not that we want to stay the same. We do want to diversify. We've been trying to work

05:26:49.660 --> 05:26:56.540
with, you know, many different stakeholders. With church groups, we created parent groups

05:26:56.540 --> 05:27:01.660
in order to support the addition of English language learners, of SPED students, of African

05:27:01.660 --> 05:27:09.660
American students. Just in one year, we increased from 11% to 22% our English learner population.

05:27:10.300 --> 05:27:22.620
This happened from 2018 to 2019. We're open to working with you guys, to changing our preferences

05:27:22.620 --> 05:27:29.900
if that's what's needed. Like I said, we added it because we had a campus that was right next to

05:27:29.900 --> 05:27:37.820
each other. But if that is going to create an issue, we are open to removing it or changing

05:27:37.820 --> 05:27:46.140
the priorities. Can I follow up on that a little bit? Yeah, and I'll wait after that for my other

05:27:46.140 --> 05:27:53.100
colleagues to comment. I just wanted to follow up on that particular issue and just get a little

05:27:53.100 --> 05:28:01.100
more clarity on some aspects of it. On the English learner population issue, if you continue to be as

05:28:01.100 --> 05:28:07.180
successful in moving kids towards reclassification quickly as you have been in the lower grades,

05:28:07.180 --> 05:28:11.500
that will go down again. So I just want people to understand that you have to watch,

05:28:12.140 --> 05:28:19.020
think about that population differently than others. But I am interested in what your specific

05:28:19.020 --> 05:28:27.340
recruitment plans are for African American students and for students with special education needs.

05:28:27.340 --> 05:28:33.740
And I know you mentioned that quickly earlier that you have a consultant working with you as a

05:28:33.740 --> 05:28:40.620
recruiter, but I couldn't catch it all in the speed with which you had to explain it. So could

05:28:40.620 --> 05:28:46.220
you tell us more about what you will be doing in the context of recruiting African American students

05:28:46.220 --> 05:28:53.980
from the community and recruiting and keeping students with special education needs? Definitely.

05:28:53.980 --> 05:29:04.060
So right now we just started working with the consultant. It's KDI Carter Zone and they are

05:29:04.060 --> 05:29:13.020
allowing us to use this GPS tracking. So they do their own breakdown of students who have

05:29:13.020 --> 05:29:22.700
special education, I'm sorry, language that is the ethnicity, race and ethnicity. They have

05:29:23.980 --> 05:29:31.660
that specific tracker and it helps us as a charter school to target areas. We haven't right now worked

05:29:31.660 --> 05:29:38.620
with middle schools in order to go into the middle school and do an outreach event. I was working at

05:29:38.620 --> 05:29:46.620
Oakland Charter High School three years ago and I was there for four years on different leadership

05:29:46.620 --> 05:29:53.100
capacities. I was a counselor there. And when I came to Henry, I'm a resident of Richmond. That's

05:29:53.100 --> 05:30:01.500
the reason why I decided to transfer over here. And we were seeing that, yes, the demographic

05:30:01.500 --> 05:30:07.740
population wasn't resembling the district. So one of the strategies that has worked or that I

05:30:08.300 --> 05:30:13.820
noted that it worked was going to the middle schools and providing the support for families

05:30:13.820 --> 05:30:20.780
to apply and also the information because sometimes they don't know what options they have

05:30:20.780 --> 05:30:28.220
and how to apply. So this is an online application through Enroll West Contra Costa. All charter

05:30:28.220 --> 05:30:35.420
schools in Contra Costa have been using this third party system in order to run their lotteries.

05:30:36.060 --> 05:30:44.620
So we are thinking, why don't we go to a middle school? Why don't we set up a table and outreach

05:30:44.620 --> 05:30:50.140
and maybe work with the leadership team at the middle schools who have high percentages of

05:30:52.140 --> 05:30:58.540
African-American students in order to be able to give the families the information. And they

05:30:58.540 --> 05:31:02.380
choose whether they want to apply to our school. But we're there to support them and help them

05:31:02.380 --> 05:31:09.420
with a computer, with staff who are going to help them apply. And then the other thing is that we

05:31:09.420 --> 05:31:15.020
are, some of our students who are currently enrolled, some of them have already graduated,

05:31:16.620 --> 05:31:21.580
specifically African-American students. This year we started a partnership with other

05:31:21.580 --> 05:31:28.220
charter schools. We created the African-American Task Force. And it's a group that we meet every

05:31:28.220 --> 05:31:33.900
quarter or every two months, I believe, in order to discuss this issue. Because it's

05:31:33.900 --> 05:31:38.140
not just an issue at John Henry High School. It's an issue at a lot of the charter schools

05:31:38.140 --> 05:31:46.460
in our community. So we are working to do an independent, basically like a survey and hiring

05:31:46.460 --> 05:31:53.820
that consultant to come in and talk to them to be able to see what is missing. How would we be

05:31:53.820 --> 05:31:59.020
able to attract more African-American students, more special education students, more English

05:31:59.020 --> 05:32:09.020
language learners to our school? And also in terms of the Task Force, we are, we're seeing that a lot

05:32:09.020 --> 05:32:14.780
of the work is very effective through word of mouth. So we've been working with pastors

05:32:15.660 --> 05:32:21.660
from African-American churches. And we've been working with families who are connected in the

05:32:21.660 --> 05:32:28.220
African-American community in order to go to events and in order to pass out that information

05:32:28.220 --> 05:32:31.980
and let them know that we exist, let them know that we're there, let them know that we're in

05:32:31.980 --> 05:32:38.620
the marina, that we're safe school, and help them apply to our school, diversify our African school.

05:32:40.060 --> 05:32:44.620
Okay, that's helpful. Let me see if there are others who would like to,

05:32:45.420 --> 05:32:51.020
I'm not seeing anyone with their hand up yet. Oh, there we go. Mr. Navo.

05:32:53.020 --> 05:32:59.820
Yeah, I want to, yeah, I just want to echo Board Member Son and Board Member Strauss' comments.

05:32:59.820 --> 05:33:03.260
And Board Member Strauss, you asked a lot of the questions that were on my mind, but

05:33:03.740 --> 05:33:08.860
one in particular that I don't know that we've had a chance to dive in a little deeper to is

05:33:08.860 --> 05:33:13.420
the question around credentialing. So for the petitioner, I know that the district

05:33:14.220 --> 05:33:18.700
raised a number of questions around credentialing. There were a number of callers that called in.

05:33:19.500 --> 05:33:22.620
Can you tell us what you're doing, how you're addressing that issue?

05:33:24.060 --> 05:33:29.660
Yeah, definitely. Since we received the notice of violation, like I told you guys before,

05:33:29.660 --> 05:33:37.180
we had to submit a very detailed credential list. Every one of our teachers, the 18 teachers that

05:33:37.180 --> 05:33:42.380
we've had, we had to provide their credentials. We had to provide the number of their credential,

05:33:42.380 --> 05:33:47.500
whether it was preliminary, clear credential, whether they were on a short-term staff permit.

05:33:49.180 --> 05:33:54.700
Every single teacher at our school has a credential or a permit in order to be in the

05:33:54.700 --> 05:33:59.820
classroom. We do not allow anybody who doesn't have the appropriate credential to be in the

05:33:59.820 --> 05:34:08.380
classroom with students. So we have been fully staffed. At the beginning of this past year,

05:34:08.380 --> 05:34:12.620
we did have a substitute teacher in one of our classrooms, but the teacher was there

05:34:13.820 --> 05:34:19.980
for 30 days only. They weren't there for any longer than that. So we follow the law. We follow

05:34:20.540 --> 05:34:28.060
credentialing requirements. And there hasn't been any, like I told you before, there hasn't been

05:34:28.060 --> 05:34:35.660
any communication from the district saying that we do not have, or that we have a problem, that

05:34:35.660 --> 05:34:45.180
we have an issue. They have not asked us to meet and confirm regarding any issue in terms of

05:34:45.180 --> 05:34:52.540
credentials, in terms of spread, nothing like that. There have been certain issues brought up

05:34:52.540 --> 05:34:59.180
that are not related to our school. They're not related to John Henry High School. And that,

05:34:59.180 --> 05:35:01.420
I think, is where the confusion is happening.

05:35:04.300 --> 05:35:13.580
Would you like to clarify that? Yeah, thank you. Yeah. So there, one of the issues that was brought

05:35:13.580 --> 05:35:21.740
up was that there was an investigation regarding a lot of different things. And that, we did have

05:35:21.740 --> 05:35:33.340
an investigation. That investigation was, I believe, in 2017, 2018. So basically,

05:35:33.340 --> 05:35:44.460
with that investigation, it was an independent, it was Oracle, and they came back and they told

05:35:44.460 --> 05:35:52.460
us that the allegations were unsubstantiated. So there was nothing there. And then after that,

05:35:53.020 --> 05:36:02.460
we received basically that notice of violation. And once again, we received the letter of good

05:36:02.460 --> 05:36:09.980
standing. We have not had any issue. There was someone who brought up a spread concern

05:36:10.700 --> 05:36:21.820
in regards to a letter from DREDF. That was not at our school. I honestly don't have information

05:36:21.820 --> 05:36:28.220
because that wasn't part of our school. We have not had any complaints or any letters of concerns

05:36:28.220 --> 05:36:37.980
since I joined the organization in 2018. I think at this point,

05:36:39.980 --> 05:36:43.660
Board President, I'm going to back away and let other board members ask questions.

05:36:44.220 --> 05:36:46.780
Okay. Member Rodriguez is waiting.

05:36:52.140 --> 05:36:58.940
So I had a couple of the questions that came up and another question. But I saw that Miss Elgato,

05:37:00.620 --> 05:37:04.140
you raised your hand, and I'm not sure if it was in response to the last issue.

05:37:05.100 --> 05:37:12.700
So if she could answer. Well, we work with board members at this point in the conversation.

05:37:12.700 --> 05:37:18.220
Okay. All right. I thought she was going to respond to that. So I similarly had the question

05:37:18.220 --> 05:37:26.140
that Mr. Navo brought up regarding the credentialing. But also when you said an

05:37:26.140 --> 05:37:33.100
investigation of things, were there, could you be specific about what things and was that at your

05:37:33.100 --> 05:37:40.300
site during the time that you were there? It was not during the time I was there. It was

05:37:40.300 --> 05:37:46.300
before I joined the organization. I joined the organization in 2018-19, specifically at John

05:37:46.300 --> 05:37:52.780
Henry High School. I had been working at Oakland Charter High School our sisters prior to that.

05:37:52.780 --> 05:38:01.420
So the investigation took place in 2017-18. And like I said, that investigation was through a

05:38:01.420 --> 05:38:08.300
third party. It was through Oracle. And yeah, once again, the allegations were unsubstantiated.

05:38:09.500 --> 05:38:16.700
We can send you information on that. I also have our board president here who can answer

05:38:17.340 --> 05:38:24.380
to that question in more detail if I'm allowed. That's okay. I'll go on to my next question.

05:38:25.180 --> 05:38:34.140
So somebody made a comment, a public comment regarding teachers being encouraged to falsify

05:38:34.140 --> 05:38:43.100
documents and that TFA was no longer sending teachers to your site. Can you respond to that,

05:38:43.100 --> 05:38:52.860
please? Yeah. So the first part of that, it was in the investigation. Once again,

05:38:52.860 --> 05:39:00.540
it was unsubstantiated. The second part, TFA, we haven't worked with TFA. John Henry started in

05:39:00.540 --> 05:39:07.420
2015. We have not worked with TFA since we started. We didn't have the partnership. So we've never

05:39:08.780 --> 05:39:17.420
had TFA say, oh, well, we're going to investigate you guys and we are not going to send teachers

05:39:17.420 --> 05:39:24.700
there. In terms of my dean of instruction, Natalie Garcia, she was a part of Teach for America and

05:39:24.700 --> 05:39:34.620
she has been there for the past two years. So I don't know where the TFA investigation took place,

05:39:34.620 --> 05:39:38.780
but it definitely didn't take place at John Henry High School because we were open since 2015 and

05:39:38.780 --> 05:39:49.820
I know that we have been working with TFA since. Thank you. All right. I'm going to

05:39:51.660 --> 05:40:00.860
ask Ms. Delgado if she wants to add a point here that was on the previous matter and then see who

05:40:00.860 --> 05:40:09.500
else wants to, then we'll go to our next board member. Thank you. Regarding the 2017-18

05:40:09.500 --> 05:40:17.580
investigation, yes, that was conducted and according to our review of the investigation,

05:40:17.580 --> 05:40:25.980
it was perplexing in that the items that were investigated had to do with actions that were

05:40:25.980 --> 05:40:32.380
taking place at John Henry High. And of the people who were interviewed, there was not a

05:40:32.380 --> 05:40:41.500
single interview of a teacher or a staff member at John Henry. All of the interviews took place

05:40:41.500 --> 05:40:50.860
with people who were from the central office. And in the words of our attorney, it was not a

05:40:50.860 --> 05:40:57.420
serious investigation. So moving on to the other issues, I think we've conflated a couple of

05:40:57.980 --> 05:41:04.300
different things. There is the letter of good standing and there is the notice of violation.

05:41:04.300 --> 05:41:11.660
The school was allowed to move on and attempt to rectify their issues, but the letter of good

05:41:11.660 --> 05:41:19.260
standing was related to funding issues and was issued specifically so that the school could

05:41:19.340 --> 05:41:28.620
continue to draw down federal resources. Could I ask, our attorney is available to answer these

05:41:28.620 --> 05:41:32.380
questions in a little more detail. Are we able to bring him into the call?

05:41:35.100 --> 05:41:45.420
If he is not currently here, I don't think so. I think he's standing ready. And also,

05:41:45.420 --> 05:41:52.540
I just wanted to return really quickly to the issue of reclassification. I pulled up the

05:41:52.540 --> 05:42:02.380
reclassification data for this particular renewal and students redesignated last year for John Henry

05:42:02.380 --> 05:42:12.540
were exactly 0% of total of 12.5%. That's the number that connects to the presentation earlier.

05:42:13.100 --> 05:42:19.420
So zero students were reclassified. They did, as I mentioned in the presentation,

05:42:19.420 --> 05:42:26.620
just recently redo their reclassification process. So I think that was put into place this year. And

05:42:26.620 --> 05:42:33.500
I think it's early to say how effective that is because there's simply no experience with it yet.

05:42:36.140 --> 05:42:41.580
I don't know if the petitioner wants to say anything about that. I do want to get to member

05:42:41.580 --> 05:42:46.460
Glover Woods. And I just want to frame this to say that at this part of the conversation,

05:42:46.460 --> 05:42:52.380
we're really trying to prioritize the questions that board members have. We've heard from both

05:42:52.380 --> 05:42:58.860
the petitioner and the district. So we want to stay specific to the questions that are getting

05:42:58.860 --> 05:43:05.660
raised. And did you want to respond on the reclassification and how that played out this year?

05:43:06.380 --> 05:43:14.460
Yeah, so the reclassification policy was in there even before John Henry High School opened

05:43:14.460 --> 05:43:22.460
because we've only been open for five years. Every so often we look at our English language

05:43:22.460 --> 05:43:29.500
learner program. We take a look at our reclassification policies. We take a look

05:43:29.500 --> 05:43:35.980
at the state or the California Department of Education County, all of that. And yes,

05:43:35.980 --> 05:43:42.700
last year we did submit a new reclassification policy to the board, which was approved.

05:43:43.740 --> 05:43:49.420
And in terms of 0% of our students being reclassified last year, that is correct.

05:43:49.420 --> 05:43:57.020
We did not have students who were at that threshold yet. And prior to that, the first two years that

05:43:57.020 --> 05:44:03.660
we opened, we saw that there were a lot of students who were long-term English learners.

05:44:03.660 --> 05:44:11.820
And we decided to reclassify at that moment because they were proficient. So we, last year

05:44:11.820 --> 05:44:17.900
we didn't have many or we didn't have any students. Then this year we did reclassify some. So it just

05:44:17.900 --> 05:44:22.220
depends on the year. It depends on where our students are at. We're not going to reclassify

05:44:22.220 --> 05:44:26.940
just because we want our numbers to look a certain way. We want to make sure that our

05:44:26.940 --> 05:44:32.220
students are ready to succeed and we're a college prep school. So we definitely want to make sure

05:44:32.220 --> 05:44:38.220
that our students are meeting the proficiency standards in order to be reclassified.

05:44:39.260 --> 05:44:45.900
And you noted that you had recruited in a lot of new English learners in this last year. It's such

05:44:45.900 --> 05:44:50.940
an unstable category that that's why I just want people to keep those points in mind.

05:44:51.820 --> 05:44:58.300
Member Glover Woods. Thank you, President Darling-Hammond. First, I'll proceed my

05:44:58.300 --> 05:45:04.060
question while I was saying that it was encouraging to hear the comments from the students

05:45:04.060 --> 05:45:08.060
that are being served and the positive statements from the parents as well.

05:45:09.340 --> 05:45:13.260
Many of the concerns I have have been brought up by my fellow board members, but I would like to

05:45:13.260 --> 05:45:19.500
drill down on a particular topic, which is the recruitment and the work that's being done to

05:45:19.500 --> 05:45:26.380
diversify the student population. It's been mentioned and I believe Ms. Flores, you mentioned

05:45:26.380 --> 05:45:33.500
that there are a lot of efforts planned or either have started as far as working with

05:45:34.460 --> 05:45:40.620
churches, working with students at the middle school level to again increase the population

05:45:40.620 --> 05:45:48.620
of African-American students and students with disabilities. My question to you is how long have

05:45:48.620 --> 05:45:54.700
those efforts been taking place? Did the start of those efforts coincide with the

05:45:57.020 --> 05:46:02.300
decision to revoke the charter or were those efforts that were put in place before?

05:46:03.180 --> 05:46:07.340
And I have one other question after that, but I'll stop there for that first response.

05:46:07.900 --> 05:46:15.420
Okay. Yeah. So we started these efforts recently and it wasn't because of the

05:46:15.420 --> 05:46:23.180
notice. It wasn't due to the notice of violation that we had from the district.

05:46:25.900 --> 05:46:32.860
That effort started this previous year. When I came to John Henry, I basically saw that we needed

05:46:32.860 --> 05:46:38.780
to do some work. We needed to improve. We needed to diversify. We needed to make sure that our

05:46:38.780 --> 05:46:46.380
students, that we had a representative group. And unfortunately in one year, we, you know,

05:46:46.380 --> 05:46:52.620
haven't seen the progress that the district wants us to have yet. We're asking for a little bit more

05:46:52.620 --> 05:47:02.300
time. We in 2015-16, which was the first year, we only had ninth and tenth graders. And then

05:47:02.300 --> 05:47:08.380
the following year we included, or we, you know, we went up ninth, tenth, and eleventh. So

05:47:09.260 --> 05:47:15.740
we didn't have that many students applying to our school. We're a brand new school. We tried to

05:47:15.740 --> 05:47:21.180
recruit from the different quarters that were around from Richmond Charter Academy, which was

05:47:22.220 --> 05:47:28.460
our middle school within the AMP system. We went to Richmond College Prep. We went to

05:47:29.180 --> 05:47:38.060
Caliber, to Waves Academy. But where we haven't done yet is we haven't gone to

05:47:39.340 --> 05:47:44.540
district middle schools in order to do that outreach. So we definitely want to open up that

05:47:44.540 --> 05:47:53.820
channel of communication. Last year we joined the district enrollment fair. That was the first year

05:47:53.820 --> 05:47:59.340
that charter schools were invited to the district recruitment fair, which was huge.

05:48:00.700 --> 05:48:06.620
It was at the Richmond auditorium. So we were very happy that we finally had established that

05:48:07.500 --> 05:48:11.580
communication between district and charters. And it wasn't just, you know, our charter.

05:48:11.580 --> 05:48:17.580
It was chartered all over the West Country across us. So since I started at John Henry,

05:48:18.460 --> 05:48:25.020
yes, there is work to be done. And I am committed to doing this work. We at John Henry,

05:48:25.020 --> 05:48:32.060
like I told you, it's not just me. It's our families. They want to be able to help. I had

05:48:32.060 --> 05:48:37.500
one of the parents tell me, her son was graduating. We did a drive-through graduation.

05:48:37.500 --> 05:48:43.980
And she told me, hey, Ms. Flores, if you want me to stay in the task force, I'll definitely stay.

05:48:44.060 --> 05:48:49.740
She's an African-American parent. Her child had special education. And she was like,

05:48:49.740 --> 05:48:54.780
I love the program. I want to help. And I want to help you guys recruit more students

05:48:55.420 --> 05:48:59.980
to diversify the school and to be able to achieve the demographics that the district is

05:48:59.980 --> 05:49:04.060
asking for. I definitely don't want John Henry to close, even though my child doesn't go there

05:49:04.060 --> 05:49:09.980
anymore. He graduated. I still want that to happen. So we definitely have those connections.

05:49:09.980 --> 05:49:17.340
We have been building more and more community connections with our outreach. I'm sorry,

05:49:17.340 --> 05:49:24.780
we hired an outreach coordinator. It was two and a half years ago. And they have also been

05:49:24.780 --> 05:49:32.780
helping with the serving in the African-American task force through West Country Cross the charter

05:49:32.780 --> 05:49:39.180
schools. And we've been, in my opinion, we've been making progress. We were not there yet.

05:49:39.180 --> 05:49:45.180
That's not, you know, I'm not trying to stay at the current level. I want to improve. And I want

05:49:45.180 --> 05:49:50.540
to make sure that our school is representative of our district numbers. And that's why we're open

05:49:50.540 --> 05:49:58.140
to changing our preferences if that's what's needed. We thought that it was good to include

05:49:59.100 --> 05:50:02.860
the neighboring school, the Richmond Charter Academy, which is right next door.

05:50:02.860 --> 05:50:07.900
But if that's not going to, you know, give us the results that we need,

05:50:08.220 --> 05:50:15.260
then we're willing to work with that. Linda, this is Stephanie. I just wanted,

05:50:15.260 --> 05:50:22.700
wouldn't you get a moment to respond? Okay, I do have just a couple of follow-up

05:50:23.260 --> 05:50:28.460
questions. They're not necessarily a couple of follow-up questions, maybe one more. It seems

05:50:28.460 --> 05:50:34.940
that it's been fairly recent for the school to reach out to the community organizations,

05:50:34.940 --> 05:50:41.900
the faith-based organizations that may provide support and services for predominantly African

05:50:41.900 --> 05:50:48.220
American community. Maintaining confidentiality, of course, for students and families at John

05:50:48.220 --> 05:50:55.580
Henry, of the three percent African American student population, approximately how many

05:50:55.580 --> 05:50:59.420
families would you say are actually represented in that three percent?

05:51:05.020 --> 05:51:08.300
What do you mean, how many families are represented in the three percent?

05:51:09.180 --> 05:51:14.860
Correct. So if you have three percent, based on the numbers that have been shared, three percent

05:51:14.860 --> 05:51:23.900
of your student population being African American, how many different families make up that three

05:51:23.900 --> 05:51:33.180
percent? Yeah, we currently don't have any siblings between African American families. So out of the

05:51:33.180 --> 05:51:45.180
315 students that we have, if we, I'm doing like math here, it's about... About 10 kids.

05:51:45.180 --> 05:51:54.860
10 students, yes. And so there are 10 different families. Like I said, we have two of the families

05:51:54.860 --> 05:52:02.300
who are really strong in terms of being in the community and helping put the word out there.

05:52:02.940 --> 05:52:09.820
This year, the lottery, we've seen huge increase in the amount of students that are applying

05:52:09.820 --> 05:52:20.300
and we are diversifying our recruit, our applicant pool. So I do expect us to move up in terms of

05:52:20.300 --> 05:52:28.620
that. Thank you. Thank you very much. I heard Stephanie's voice a moment ago. I tried to find

05:52:28.620 --> 05:52:34.700
you on my Hollywood Squares, but go ahead, Stephanie, if you would like to make it up.

05:52:34.700 --> 05:52:43.100
I don't know that I'm on the Hollywood Squares. So I just wanted to respond that I appreciate

05:52:43.100 --> 05:52:52.780
hearing for the first time all of the recruitment strategies that John Henry is putting in place

05:52:52.780 --> 05:53:00.060
now, which is great. But I also want to make sure that it's understood that you can put in great

05:53:00.060 --> 05:53:06.300
recruitment strategies and you can have a lot of kids on the wait list going into the lottery,

05:53:06.300 --> 05:53:12.540
but if you don't change the preferences, you're not really going to see much of a difference

05:53:12.540 --> 05:53:20.540
unless those kids are already in the AMP system. So the recruitment strategies are great, but it's

05:53:20.620 --> 05:53:25.420
not going to make much of a dent if the preferences stay the same because all those kids are in the

05:53:25.420 --> 05:53:30.300
lottery. And as you know, once you're in the lottery, those preferences kick in. But I just

05:53:30.300 --> 05:53:37.580
wanted to clarify that. Thank you very much. And that I'm not seeing any other board members hands

05:53:37.580 --> 05:53:42.700
up, so that may get us close to the question that we might want to be raising, which is,

05:53:43.500 --> 05:53:49.260
as we have experienced in other cases, if we want to consider conditions, those might include

05:53:49.260 --> 05:53:56.540
conditions around the preferences or other features that we've heard concerns about.

05:53:58.460 --> 05:54:06.300
So this is, oh, Brenna has her hand up. And if anyone else wants to get in the conversation,

05:54:06.300 --> 05:54:12.140
this will be the time to flag it so that we can move forward towards a vote.

05:54:12.140 --> 05:54:15.740
Linda, after Brenna, Patricia Rucker would like to ask a question, too.

05:54:16.700 --> 05:54:21.980
Great. And then I have member Strauss also in the list. Go ahead, Brenna.

05:54:21.980 --> 05:54:30.940
Yeah, just quickly. Hi, there. So, you know, I think the school is already committed to

05:54:30.940 --> 05:54:37.340
responding positively to the conditions, you know, and we're ready to implement whatever it is that

05:54:37.340 --> 05:54:43.980
the state board decides as conditions. You know, with lottery preferences, as Director Farland

05:54:43.980 --> 05:54:51.020
mentioned, those can be a helpful way to change up demographics, because we're, of course, we can't

05:54:51.900 --> 05:54:55.660
have any preferences that discriminate on the basis of race or ethnicity.

05:54:57.420 --> 05:54:59.900
And in terms of the suspension and expulsion...

05:55:00.780 --> 05:55:06.540
I think we want to know about the suspension and expulsion policy in very specific terms.

05:55:06.540 --> 05:55:12.060
Sorry, is that for me?

05:55:12.060 --> 05:55:13.820
That was raised as an area of concern.

05:55:16.540 --> 05:55:23.260
So the area of concern that was raised was regarding our handbook. So on the petition,

05:55:25.020 --> 05:55:31.260
I don't believe that there were any issues that arose. It was related to the family handbook,

05:55:31.260 --> 05:55:40.220
which was online, and it was an old family handbook that we had used in previous years.

05:55:40.220 --> 05:55:51.260
We have since removed that language. In the presentation from CDE staff,

05:55:51.260 --> 05:55:56.060
you guys saw that one of the blocks was for suspension. We are in the green.

05:55:56.780 --> 05:56:02.700
Our suspension rate is very low. In the past five years, there has been one expulsion,

05:56:02.700 --> 05:56:11.100
unfortunately, but we tried our best to support every single student. We have used

05:56:12.460 --> 05:56:20.060
reserve justice practices. We've been working with our previous dean of students. It wasn't

05:56:20.060 --> 05:56:28.780
that he left the organization. He transferred to the elementary school. He taught us a lot

05:56:29.580 --> 05:56:34.620
when he was here, and we've been instituting those practices. We've been systematizing those

05:56:34.620 --> 05:56:41.260
practices, and we definitely don't like to suspend students. We don't like to expel students at all.

05:56:42.620 --> 05:56:49.500
As you can see, our dashboard data is in the green for suspensions because we've been using

05:56:50.060 --> 05:56:57.740
other methods when there are behavior issues that arise. We're not in the business of suspending

05:56:57.740 --> 05:57:03.500
or expelling students. We have two amazing counselors who have been working tirelessly

05:57:03.500 --> 05:57:08.940
with our students. They support them since they're in ninth grade. Two counselors for a student body

05:57:08.940 --> 05:57:15.420
of 315, we think that that is part of the reason why our suspension rate is so low, because we are

05:57:15.420 --> 05:57:22.140
able to serve them and to start working with them in groups and all of that.

05:57:23.340 --> 05:57:29.500
So I hope that answered the question. If you need more specifics, I'm open to answering that.

05:57:30.780 --> 05:57:33.340
I thought that was clear. Did you have anything else, Brenna?

05:57:36.940 --> 05:57:39.900
Brenna, did that answer your question adequately?

05:57:40.380 --> 05:57:48.700
Are you frozen? I think Brenna's frozen. Brenna, are you able to try again?

05:57:49.260 --> 05:57:55.340
Yes. Can you hear me now? Yeah. Can you hear me? Yes. I was just going to ask what the

05:57:55.340 --> 05:57:59.020
restorative justice practices were, a little more specifically.

05:58:01.340 --> 05:58:05.740
Okay, can we get a succinct rendering on that? And then I do want to move to a couple other

05:58:05.740 --> 05:58:11.420
callers waiting. You can move on. You can move on. Okay. So I think Member Rucker is waiting to

05:58:11.420 --> 05:58:16.220
get in. So I'm going to acknowledge her, because she's had such a hard time today. We definitely

05:58:16.220 --> 05:58:23.020
want to hear from her when she's able. Patricia, can you get in? I'm hoping you can hear me.

05:58:23.820 --> 05:58:31.340
We can. Yes, we can hear you. Okay. Well, first of all, I want to thank my family. I'm so grateful

05:58:31.340 --> 05:58:35.340
to have you here. Thank you so much. We can hear you. Okay. Well, first of all, I want to thank

05:58:35.340 --> 05:58:41.100
my fellow board members. I think you've been having some psychic moments in reading my mind

05:58:41.100 --> 05:58:47.980
and asking a number of my questions. So the frustration with the technology really and truly

05:58:47.980 --> 05:58:56.380
has not hampered my ability to feel that I'm participating in this call. So let me just say,

05:58:56.620 --> 05:59:04.460
I heard the President suggest that maybe we could consider looking at some conditions as a way

05:59:05.100 --> 05:59:12.140
of looking at how to approve or how to move forward on this particular charter. And let me

05:59:12.140 --> 05:59:18.380
just give a little perspective from where I'm sitting out here with the inability to speak

05:59:18.380 --> 05:59:25.980
in some detail about that. There was yesterday you created some conditions for approving a charter,

05:59:25.980 --> 05:59:31.180
and the conditions on that charter were significant and important, primarily because

05:59:31.180 --> 05:59:39.660
it addressed an opportunity for the development of a new program and a specific approach

05:59:39.660 --> 05:59:48.940
to serve a particular community. And we just, on the previous item, also approved a number of

05:59:48.940 --> 05:59:59.980
conditions to correct a charter application or to correct a renewal that had problems that through

06:00:00.700 --> 06:00:07.180
all of the conditions that are happening right now, at this exact instance, through the hearing

06:00:07.180 --> 06:00:13.820
process, just there was simply interference for a lot of conditions that were probably unique and

06:00:13.900 --> 06:00:20.300
different conditions. And so I understand why those conditions were added to that charter,

06:00:20.300 --> 06:00:27.260
especially given the fact that we would have a partner with the local LEA that would be doing

06:00:27.260 --> 06:00:32.380
a lot of the oversight and monitoring and support with the implementation and the work that that

06:00:32.380 --> 06:00:40.140
charter would be doing as it opened going forward. This charter is different. In listening to the

06:00:40.140 --> 06:00:48.460
presentation from both sides, there obviously is conflicting information. There's also a conflating

06:00:48.460 --> 06:00:55.980
of a lot of ideas or a lot of points of information about whether the charter was substantially out of

06:00:55.980 --> 06:01:02.780
compliance or had met their compliance requirements from the notice of violation. And the district,

06:01:02.780 --> 06:01:08.780
and I found the district's presentation was very compelling in pointing out what the problems

06:01:08.780 --> 06:01:14.300
of this charter were. These are not new problems. These are not problems that have arisen

06:01:14.300 --> 06:01:21.340
in the past couple of months. These are problems that have been recurring and occurring throughout

06:01:21.340 --> 06:01:28.300
the period of the relationship the LEA has had with the charter. I'm concerned that there is a

06:01:28.300 --> 06:01:34.300
teacher recruitment and preparation program, Teach for America, who thrives on not only an

06:01:34.300 --> 06:01:41.260
innovative program for developing teachers but also looks for innovative opportunities

06:01:41.260 --> 06:01:47.900
for their workforce to go into teaching, has decided to change or alter their relationship.

06:01:47.900 --> 06:01:54.380
And I'm further concerned that despite what the charter management organization is saying about

06:01:54.380 --> 06:02:00.780
what they have done and what they are now trying to do, the district is quite clear that this is

06:02:01.500 --> 06:02:07.180
something that the problems are things that they are aware of and that they either have not addressed

06:02:07.180 --> 06:02:14.700
or have been inadequate to address. So I'm not sure how a set of conditions for this charter

06:02:14.700 --> 06:02:20.940
are going to resolve problems that fall somewhere on the continuum between you haven't done nothing

06:02:20.940 --> 06:02:27.020
or you simply haven't done enough. So I'm concerned not only about the quality of the management of

06:02:27.020 --> 06:02:32.220
this charter but I'm concerned that the problems are not simply going to go away with a set of

06:02:32.220 --> 06:02:38.460
conditions aimed at trying to support the charter as you have with the previous two items and the

06:02:38.460 --> 06:02:44.300
previous two hearings. The conditions are not the same and I do not have faith in the ability

06:02:44.300 --> 06:02:49.820
of this charter to address these problems because they clearly have not done so up to this point.

06:02:49.820 --> 06:02:54.860
I'm done.

06:02:57.820 --> 06:03:08.700
I will make a small response just to the reason why I raised that question. By law, the primary

06:03:11.100 --> 06:03:16.860
metric we need to use is the performance of a school in relation to the other schools that

06:03:16.860 --> 06:03:22.860
students would attend in its absence and it's clear that in this particular case,

06:03:24.460 --> 06:03:28.780
students in this school are outperforming those in surrounding schools in English,

06:03:28.780 --> 06:03:35.980
Language, Arts, and Math. So we have a burden of growth in relation to this particular renewal

06:03:36.940 --> 06:03:44.220
and we've heard a lot of the back and forth about different conditions but some of those have

06:03:45.100 --> 06:03:49.580
stayed on the table and some of them have been moved off the table and so I think

06:03:50.940 --> 06:03:55.980
it would seem reasonable to be thinking about that question but I would love to

06:03:55.980 --> 06:04:00.620
hear from the other board members and member Strauss is next in the queue.

06:04:02.540 --> 06:04:09.340
The only comment that I wanted to make was that I had some very strong concerns about

06:04:09.980 --> 06:04:18.460
the turnover and the amount of teachers. We know it takes teachers a couple of years,

06:04:18.460 --> 06:04:22.220
three to five years to gain confidence and skill set to really make a difference

06:04:23.020 --> 06:04:27.900
and so the amount of turnover I was very concerned about and also in the whole

06:04:27.900 --> 06:04:34.620
management organization, it seemed like there seemed to be, as I heard from the district

06:04:34.620 --> 06:04:41.260
presentation, a lot of turnover. I don't know that that's a condition we can put in because who

06:04:41.260 --> 06:04:47.420
knows what the causes are obviously for recruitment and support for teachers as they develop but I

06:04:47.420 --> 06:04:54.060
just want to put that on the table that I am concerned about the constant turnover as it was

06:04:54.060 --> 06:05:02.140
presented. I have one other factual question I'd just like to ask which is the question about the

06:05:02.780 --> 06:05:07.580
role of the county offices. I believe I understood and maybe Stephanie is the one to answer this

06:05:07.580 --> 06:05:15.020
question. The district denied and then the county declined to hear the appeal, is that right?

06:05:15.740 --> 06:05:20.140
I believe they heard the appeal. They declined to take action.

06:05:22.060 --> 06:05:29.980
Is that correct? Yeah, no, they didn't hear it at all. Okay, I'm sorry, they didn't hear it at all.

06:05:30.940 --> 06:05:35.740
They declined to hear it at all. So they did not, they did not deny the charter?

06:05:35.740 --> 06:05:43.660
No, they did not. And do we know anything? I mean, I would love a little background about

06:05:43.660 --> 06:05:49.100
what it means when a county steps aside and says we're not going to hear the appeal.

06:05:51.660 --> 06:05:58.860
Should I respond to this? Yeah. This is Judy Sias with the Chief Council for the State Board.

06:05:58.860 --> 06:06:05.020
Under the law, the county has the option to not hear the appeal. So I don't think we can

06:06:05.740 --> 06:06:10.460
try to presume what their motives were or were not. But if they declined to hear it,

06:06:10.460 --> 06:06:17.660
there's nothing in the record as to their issues or concerns or anything about this charter school.

06:06:21.020 --> 06:06:27.580
Okay, so we can just correct the record on that score and move to any other.

06:06:29.020 --> 06:06:29.500
Questions?

06:06:35.580 --> 06:06:38.940
Linda, Matt has his hand up. Okay, member Navo.

06:06:40.300 --> 06:06:46.620
I just have just a few questions for C.D. Just to Stephanie, are you, are you there?

06:06:47.980 --> 06:06:55.900
Yes, I am here. Sorry. Okay. I know I saw you walk away. I just want to get back to

06:06:56.140 --> 06:07:01.420
brass tacks a bit, because I do sense that there's a struggle between what the district

06:07:03.580 --> 06:07:09.900
sees and understands and what the petitioner sees and understands. And I see a petitioner who,

06:07:09.900 --> 06:07:15.580
by all extensive purposes, seems to be willing to try and make whatever adjustments are necessary.

06:07:15.580 --> 06:07:22.860
But I just want to go back to the original presentation. The charter was academic,

06:07:23.020 --> 06:07:26.940
academically, it met the requirement. Is that correct?

06:07:26.940 --> 06:07:31.820
Yes, it met the threshold for the academic renewal criteria. Yeah, it did. Yes.

06:07:31.820 --> 06:07:35.980
And it, okay, and it met the requirement fiscally?

06:07:36.860 --> 06:07:40.140
They are, they are fiscally, yes. Yes, they are.

06:07:41.340 --> 06:07:48.940
So the issues that we're talking about are related to the, the program, but it sounds

06:07:48.940 --> 06:07:51.340
like we're also talking about things of the past.

06:07:51.340 --> 06:07:58.940
What is, what is all of this fall under? Right. I would say that the, the, the,

06:07:58.940 --> 06:08:06.060
the primary issues would be access for students to attend the school. And that was whether students

06:08:06.060 --> 06:08:12.940
in the district have access to the school. And that was one of the primary issues. We also had

06:08:12.940 --> 06:08:22.700
issues with some of the elements that we had, we had gone over in the presentation

06:08:23.340 --> 06:08:28.140
in terms of employee qualifications and in terms of the suspension expulsion,

06:08:29.020 --> 06:08:34.460
which they addressed in terms of retirement coverage, dispute resolution. But I would say

06:08:34.460 --> 06:08:42.780
that the biggest concern for us and the, and the, the issue that we really wanted the board to,

06:08:43.420 --> 06:08:52.300
to discuss was this issue of access for all students and whether or not moving forward,

06:08:53.100 --> 06:08:57.180
if they moved forward over the next five years, students would actually have,

06:08:57.180 --> 06:09:02.380
more students would have access to the school, which we found not to be the case because of the

06:09:03.100 --> 06:09:09.660
preferences they put into their admission requirements. And so I, I think the department

06:09:09.660 --> 06:09:14.460
feels that access is an important issue when it comes to charter schools. It's something that

06:09:14.460 --> 06:09:20.940
we've discussed in other items and other appeals over the course of the last year or so. And I'd

06:09:20.940 --> 06:09:28.220
say that was, that is very much a concern. Okay. That, that helps a great deal. So

06:09:28.220 --> 06:09:34.140
really what, either the preferences change or the potential that we're going to be continuing

06:09:34.140 --> 06:09:40.140
to deal with this issue. Yes. Yes. Because recruitment is great, but if you don't change

06:09:40.140 --> 06:09:43.980
your preferences, then there's no other way for other types of students to come in.

06:09:45.100 --> 06:09:48.460
So that becomes the issue. And I got to, I have a question about 1505.

06:09:49.980 --> 06:09:57.420
The charters that the state authorizes, right? When 15 after July one, we're past July one. So

06:09:57.420 --> 06:10:03.660
we're, where do they fall? Where does this charter come back to for renewal? They say

06:10:03.660 --> 06:10:09.020
they are approved for five years. Where do they come back? Us or the county office, the authorizer?

06:10:10.540 --> 06:10:18.060
After, I think it, they would go back to the local, the local district. Yes.

06:10:18.060 --> 06:10:23.580
Okay. That, that, okay. So I didn't, I didn't quite, I didn't phrase the question very well.

06:10:24.220 --> 06:10:31.020
My, my, my point was that I think this goes to the petitioner at the end of this journey,

06:10:31.660 --> 06:10:37.740
if you can't come to agreement with the district, at some point, you're going to come to a fork in

06:10:37.740 --> 06:10:43.100
the road, but where the district is the authorizer and they don't come to us. Is that correct?

06:10:44.060 --> 06:10:49.180
Under 1505. Well, under, under this is Judy size under 1505 at some point,

06:10:49.740 --> 06:10:55.260
um, not for this appeal, since this appeal was heard by the district in the county before

06:10:55.260 --> 06:11:01.260
AB 1505 took effect. So start there, but in the future, when they come up for renewal again,

06:11:01.260 --> 06:11:06.140
in the future, should they be renewed this time, then they would be subject to 1505 where they

06:11:06.140 --> 06:11:10.060
would be, could eventually come to the board under a different standard that would be under

06:11:10.060 --> 06:11:17.740
an abuse of discretion standard. Right. Okay. So it's, it's going to be incumbent, whatever happens

06:11:18.380 --> 06:11:24.460
if the charter is renewed through us, at some point, the charter and the district and the

06:11:24.460 --> 06:11:28.460
county are going to have to come to agreement because it's not going to come to us again in

06:11:28.460 --> 06:11:32.940
the same way. I'm sorry, Matt. This is Judy. I'd like to correct my answer a little bit. Um,

06:11:32.940 --> 06:11:40.540
been a long day. I think, um, for all of us, I know, um, the first renewal, they will come back

06:11:40.540 --> 06:11:46.780
to us under the current, um, under a de novo review. Um, but then eventually you are right.

06:11:46.780 --> 06:11:50.940
There will be a fork in the road where they will have to get authorized locally and be

06:11:51.500 --> 06:11:55.660
appealed or it's an appeal. It would be under an abusive discretion standard.

06:11:58.060 --> 06:11:58.780
Okay. Thank you.

06:12:02.460 --> 06:12:10.060
All right. Um, any other questions from anyone? If not, I wonder if we can see if there's a motion.

06:12:10.540 --> 06:12:17.260
Okay. I don't see anyone else with their hand up. Oh, Brenna. Okay.

06:12:19.100 --> 06:12:26.140
Um, can Stephanie speak on the governance issues that, that, um, former record brought up

06:12:28.620 --> 06:12:34.860
or management issues? Just, she was concerned that I want to have one more chance for

06:12:36.140 --> 06:12:38.860
Stephanie to feel you can respond to that.

06:12:40.540 --> 06:12:48.540
Um, the, the department didn't have governance issues. I think that came from the district.

06:12:50.300 --> 06:12:59.500
Okay. So that was not an issue that that was not, no, it was not. Okay. All right. Um, all right.

06:13:02.460 --> 06:13:09.180
Do we have, uh, we have no other hands up. Do we have a motion? Yes. So I will, if I could make

06:13:09.180 --> 06:13:16.220
a few comments and then I will make my motions, uh, appreciate the, my fellow board members

06:13:16.220 --> 06:13:22.780
questions and deliberation in this topic. It is not easy as most of those of us who've gone through

06:13:22.780 --> 06:13:29.420
some of these charter renewal processes before. Uh, I wanted to just say that, um, although academic

06:13:29.420 --> 06:13:36.620
performance is the most important part of, for renewal, there are other compelling factors that

06:13:36.620 --> 06:13:44.700
we often need to and should look at. And so, um, I think the questions that is raised by board

06:13:44.700 --> 06:13:54.140
members and, um, it really spoke to those in the case of John Henry, the school has acknowledged

06:13:54.140 --> 06:14:01.100
that their opening was not perfect and they have, uh, very earnestly communicated their openness to

06:14:01.100 --> 06:14:07.820
making the recommended improvements and knowing that they are in their first renewal there,

06:14:07.820 --> 06:14:14.140
they were a startup. Um, it does take a while for your student demographics to, to, um,

06:14:14.140 --> 06:14:23.100
make that change, but I believe that they have, um, shown lots of success with their students.

06:14:23.100 --> 06:14:27.580
Um, they are accomplishing their mission of sending their students to college.

06:14:28.220 --> 06:14:35.660
And, uh, I was very impressed too, that I think it was something like 92 or 94 percent of the

06:14:35.660 --> 06:14:41.660
students, or maybe even 96 percent of their students, they, during the, um, campus closures,

06:14:41.660 --> 06:14:48.220
they were able to outreach and connect with their students during this past spring. So this is,

06:14:48.220 --> 06:14:54.700
uh, I see this as a school that is, um, meeting the student needs. Certainly there are some areas

06:14:54.700 --> 06:15:02.300
of work and so I am ready to make, um, areas of work, including, um, repairing some of those

06:15:02.300 --> 06:15:10.460
relationships with, um, their, their, the district and their areas. So with that, um, I am making a

06:15:10.460 --> 06:15:21.100
recommendation that we approve the renewal of John Henry, uh, charter and, and I have some conditions

06:15:21.100 --> 06:15:28.460
that will go with that that's on the screen right now. So here we go. So recommending approval of

06:15:28.460 --> 06:15:34.060
renewal of John Henry High for a term of five years with the following conditions. That John Henry

06:15:34.060 --> 06:15:40.220
High will conduct a root, uh, cause analysis and develop an academic action plan focused on

06:15:40.220 --> 06:15:45.500
identifying and improving the school's mathematics performance and its services and performance for

06:15:45.500 --> 06:15:50.940
students with disabilities. This plan will include a description of related staff training and

06:15:50.940 --> 06:15:57.500
support for utilizing assessment data and targeted instruction and intervention. The Amethyst

06:15:57.500 --> 06:16:03.740
Public Schools Executive Board will adopt a plan, the plan, and provide it to the California

06:16:03.740 --> 06:16:10.460
Department of Education by October 1st, 2020. John Henry's leadership will provide quarterly

06:16:10.460 --> 06:16:16.780
updates to CDE on their implementation of the academic action plan. John Henry will provide

06:16:16.780 --> 06:16:23.020
residents of West Contra Costa Unified School District enrollment preference above all other

06:16:23.020 --> 06:16:28.860
preferences categories described in the tradition document, with the sole exception of siblings of

06:16:28.860 --> 06:16:37.420
current students. Um, this preference is intended to produce a student body that mirrors local

06:16:38.460 --> 06:16:45.340
ethnic English learner and special education demographics. John Henry High will provide an

06:16:45.340 --> 06:16:53.340
annual update to the CDE on or before October 15th, 2020 on its success in recruiting, enrolling,

06:16:53.340 --> 06:16:59.340
and maintaining a student population that matches local demographics. The student will, the school,

06:16:59.340 --> 06:17:05.020
sorry, will submit to the CDE a revised budget and a revised charter petition that addresses

06:17:05.020 --> 06:17:10.300
deficiencies and or includes necessary language as outlined in the CDE staff analysis.

06:17:10.300 --> 06:17:19.500
All right. Thanks very much. Is there a second for this motion?

06:17:23.980 --> 06:17:30.220
I will second that motion. I appreciate Board Member Sun's detail. I like the

06:17:31.580 --> 06:17:37.820
requirements to come back and review admissions preferences, so I will second that. And I,

06:17:38.380 --> 06:17:44.380
yeah, I will second that and just simply add that again, at some point with this recommendation,

06:17:44.380 --> 06:17:49.100
the petitioner is going to have to mend the relationship with the district and the county

06:17:50.620 --> 06:17:56.540
based on 1505. All right. Is there any further discussion?

06:17:56.540 --> 06:18:10.140
Seeing no hands raised, I think we're ready for a roll call vote. Karen, can you conduct the roll

06:18:10.140 --> 06:18:25.260
call? Yes. Ting? Yes. Eileen? Yes. Eileen? Yes. Okay. Yes. Iday?

06:18:27.500 --> 06:18:31.260
Iday, you might be talking to yourself on mute.

06:18:35.100 --> 06:18:39.660
She was having technology trouble. I was raising my hand instead. Yes. Okay.

06:18:41.020 --> 06:18:44.860
We need a vocal vote from everyone. Iday, can you repeat your?

06:18:47.500 --> 06:18:50.220
Yes. Okay. Thank you. Kim?

06:18:50.220 --> 06:19:05.820
Abstaining since I missed most of the presentation. Okay. Brenna? Yes. Matt? Yes. Jim? Yes. Cynthia?

06:19:11.740 --> 06:19:19.740
Yes. Linda? Yes. And then Patricia? No. Okay.

06:19:21.180 --> 06:19:32.060
The measure passes. Okay. Wow. You guys are in a marathon here. We all are. And we have another

06:19:33.100 --> 06:19:40.220
charter renewal, which is the Fresh Start Charter. We're going to take a 10-minute break

06:19:40.300 --> 06:19:50.620
so that Stephanie can organize and set up. And we'll be back at 4, let's say, 422.

06:19:58.700 --> 06:20:00.620
All right. Are we all reassembled?

06:20:00.620 --> 06:20:13.580
I am having some trouble with my computer now. I think it's just over. It's exhausted.

06:20:15.980 --> 06:20:23.260
Yes. We all are. And I want to start out by welcoming everyone back. I think

06:20:24.220 --> 06:20:29.660
probably Karen needs to call the roll to reestablish the quorum. Yes. I shall call the roll.

06:20:30.780 --> 06:20:46.060
Okay. Linda? I'm here. Cynthia? Here. Jim? Here. Matt? Here. Brenna? Here. Kim?

06:20:46.620 --> 06:21:04.380
With volume here. Okay. Hi. Hi, Day? Here. Eileen? Yes, here. Ting? Here. Patricia Rucker?

06:21:05.500 --> 06:21:13.180
Here. Yay. Good. Everyone's present. All right. And I want to say at the beginning of this

06:21:13.740 --> 06:21:20.780
part of the process that I have to leave shortly after 5 for another meeting and that will come

06:21:20.780 --> 06:21:28.380
back. So I'll be in and out and Vice President Strauss will take the gavel at that point and

06:21:28.380 --> 06:21:35.180
carry us forward. Agenda item 21 is a public hearing regarding petition for the renewal of

06:21:35.180 --> 06:21:40.300
a charter school under the oversight of the State Board of Education. Consideration of today's

06:21:40.300 --> 06:21:45.420
Fresh Start Charter School, Inglewood, which was denied by the Inglewood Unified School District

06:21:45.420 --> 06:21:51.020
and the Los Angeles County Board of Education. The CDE recommends that the State Board hold a

06:21:51.020 --> 06:21:56.380
public hearing to deny the request to renew today's Fresh Start Charter School, Inglewood,

06:21:56.380 --> 06:22:02.140
a transitional kindergarten, kindergarten TKK through grade eight charter school.

06:22:02.140 --> 06:22:07.420
And this item will be presented by Stephanie Farland of CDE. Stephanie, please begin.

06:22:07.900 --> 06:22:18.140
Great. Thank you, Linda. Thank you, Stephanie. Good afternoon, everyone. So as mentioned,

06:22:18.140 --> 06:22:23.020
we're here today to hear the appeal for today's Fresh Start Charter School, Inglewood.

06:22:25.020 --> 06:22:29.180
The charter school is currently authorized by the Inglewood Unified School District

06:22:29.180 --> 06:22:35.260
with a charter term that expired on June 30th, 2020. The petitioner sought renewal from IUSD

06:22:35.260 --> 06:22:41.980
and the Los Angeles County Board of Education. They were denied on October 11th by IUSD

06:22:41.980 --> 06:22:50.860
and on January 7th, 2020 by the LA County Board. At the June 9th, 2020 Advisory Commission on

06:22:50.860 --> 06:22:57.980
Charter Schools meeting, the ACCS moved the CDE staff recommendation to deny today's Fresh Start

06:22:59.180 --> 06:23:04.620
petition to the State Board of Education. The motion passed by a vote of six to three.

06:23:05.260 --> 06:23:13.420
As stated, our recommendation, the department's recommendation is that the State Board hold a

06:23:13.420 --> 06:23:21.500
public hearing to deny the request to renew TFS CSI, a transitional kindergarten through eighth

06:23:21.500 --> 06:23:27.820
grade charter school under the oversight of the State Board. This is going to be an acronym that

06:23:27.820 --> 06:23:35.020
I'm going to keep tripping over. TFS CSI is demonstrably unlikely to successfully

06:23:35.020 --> 06:23:40.860
implement the intended program. The operational history of the Today's Fresh Start organization

06:23:40.860 --> 06:23:47.020
exhibits ambiguity, self-dealings, and a lack of transparency. Conflicts of interest based on

06:23:47.020 --> 06:23:54.620
related party transaction. And in its history, in 2007, Today's Fresh Start countywide was revoked

06:23:54.620 --> 06:24:00.700
by the LA County Board of Education. The petition does not provide a reasonably comprehensive

06:24:00.700 --> 06:24:05.180
description of the required elements and the petitioner has a past history of involvement

06:24:05.180 --> 06:24:13.340
in charter schools that the SBE may regard as unsuccessful. A little background on the school.

06:24:13.340 --> 06:24:19.660
Today's Fresh Start Inglewood is currently authorized by Inglewood Unified School District

06:24:19.660 --> 06:24:26.540
and serves 430 TKK through grade eight pupils on a private facility with a charter term, as stated,

06:24:26.540 --> 06:24:32.300
that ended on June 30th. TFS Inc. operated a countywide charter which was revoked and later

06:24:32.300 --> 06:24:38.700
closed in June 2015. Petitioner also operates Today's Fresh Start Compton authorized by the

06:24:38.700 --> 06:24:47.260
Compton Unified School District with a term that ends in 2023. Today's Fresh Start intends to serve

06:24:47.260 --> 06:24:54.700
527 students in TKK through grade eight in 2021. Their mission is to educate each scholar

06:24:54.700 --> 06:24:59.740
individually and personally, academically, emotionally, and socially to achieve their

06:24:59.740 --> 06:25:05.740
individual academic potential and personal best. And you can see on the graph that projected

06:25:05.740 --> 06:25:13.580
enrollment starts at 527 for the next school year and moves up to 727 for 2024-25.

06:25:16.060 --> 06:25:19.020
The California Department of Education's findings and concerns.

06:25:19.740 --> 06:25:25.580
Fiscal and governance concerns. Current governance concerns in past history of fiscal mismanagement

06:25:25.580 --> 06:25:31.180
were critical in CDE's recommendation of denial as it has an impact on Today's Fresh Start's

06:25:31.180 --> 06:25:36.700
ability to serve its pupils. Operational history of Today's Fresh Start exhibits ambiguity,

06:25:36.700 --> 06:25:40.860
self-dealings, and a lack of transparency resulting in adverse relationships with its

06:25:40.860 --> 06:25:45.580
authorizers. Conflicts of interest based on related party transactions, which include

06:25:45.660 --> 06:25:50.700
transactions with Golden Day Schools, Inc., Los Angeles School Services, Inc., and California

06:25:50.700 --> 06:25:56.700
Construction Management Services. TFS, Inc. has a long history of movement between authorizers as

06:25:56.700 --> 06:26:02.300
well as negative outcomes in terms of non-renewals and litigation, including the 2007 Today's Fresh

06:26:02.300 --> 06:26:09.020
Start countywide charter revocation by the LA County Board of Ed. Conflicts of interest.

06:26:10.060 --> 06:26:14.460
Today's Fresh Start Inglewood contracted with California Construction Management Services,

06:26:14.460 --> 06:26:18.860
which is run by the petitioner's husband and for which the petitioner served as an officer.

06:26:19.980 --> 06:26:24.540
Golden Day Schools, Inc. is a related entity and run by a petitioner's husband,

06:26:24.540 --> 06:26:31.820
contracted with the CDE for child care services. Today's Fresh Start to Inglewood audit findings,

06:26:31.820 --> 06:26:35.420
which were upheld by the courts, included findings of various improper conflicts of

06:26:35.420 --> 06:26:41.260
interest based on related entities. And further note, the Department of Education is currently

06:26:41.260 --> 06:26:46.700
in litigation against the Golden Day Schools, Inc. and the petitioner's husband to recover

06:26:46.700 --> 06:26:53.820
disallowed costs of approximately $20 million. LA School Services, Inc., an entity owned and

06:26:53.820 --> 06:26:58.620
operated by the petitioner and her husband, owns the building Today's Fresh Start Compton leases.

06:26:59.420 --> 06:27:04.220
The petitioner also appears to run religious organizations that use the Today's Fresh Start

06:27:04.220 --> 06:27:11.500
address. Unsuccessful history. Today's Fresh Start, Inc., a non-profit benefit corporation,

06:27:11.500 --> 06:27:18.380
has been operating charter schools since 2003. In 2007, their countywide was revoked by the LA

06:27:18.380 --> 06:27:23.980
County Board of Ed, which resulted in litigation, which was settled in 2015 when the revocation was

06:27:23.980 --> 06:27:31.340
upheld by the California Supreme Court. Today's Fresh Start Compton, in relation to today's Fresh

06:27:31.340 --> 06:27:36.700
Start Compton, TFS, Inc., dissolved the countywide benefit after the revocation was upheld and filed

06:27:36.700 --> 06:27:42.780
a single school petition approved by the Compton Unified School District. The California state

06:27:42.780 --> 06:27:47.580
budget impact, this is, as you will recognize, the same slide we've been using in all of our

06:27:48.380 --> 06:27:55.900
appeals the last couple of days to describe and explain the budget impact during this COVID-19

06:27:55.900 --> 06:28:03.340
pandemic and the impact it will have on the state budget to LEAs, including charter schools in 2021

06:28:03.340 --> 06:28:13.100
and the future. With the fiscal analysis, we did not find that Today's Fresh Start

06:28:15.180 --> 06:28:23.740
would have any fiscal issues during this time, or as we analyze their budget and their budget

06:28:23.740 --> 06:28:31.820
projections, would not have any issues in terms of deferrals. However, as you can see here, they

06:28:31.820 --> 06:28:40.060
have a projected enrollment of 527, with positive ending fund balances of 19 million, over 19 million

06:28:41.500 --> 06:28:50.300
with reserves of 300%, 295%, and 276% for fiscal years 2020 through 2023, respectively.

06:28:51.180 --> 06:28:57.260
Now that first block there includes their charter school facilities grant, so when we take that out

06:28:58.780 --> 06:29:05.980
of their budget, they still are viable and they still have very large

06:29:07.180 --> 06:29:10.220
ending fund balances and very large reserves.

06:29:10.220 --> 06:29:15.180
The Department of Ed is concerned about the following. Their high reserves are well above

06:29:15.180 --> 06:29:20.860
what is normally required by the State Board of Ed, which is 5%, and if you remember, they have

06:29:20.860 --> 06:29:30.380
over 100% reserves. The TFSI, what we're concerned about is that they're not spending money on

06:29:30.380 --> 06:29:36.060
students being served by the school. If they were investing in the school, they would be spending

06:29:36.060 --> 06:29:41.580
students being served by the school. If they were investing resources in pupils, I think you

06:29:41.580 --> 06:29:46.940
will see when we get to their academic achievement, they would probably likely yield a more significant

06:29:46.940 --> 06:29:52.940
gain in academic achievement, as well as when we noticed that these funding reserves were so high

06:29:53.500 --> 06:29:57.420
and were questioning whether or not they were spending money on students, we did go out and

06:29:57.420 --> 06:30:04.460
look at the SARCs for some of the schools that we used in our comparable school comparisons with

06:30:04.540 --> 06:30:12.380
today's Fresh Start, Inglewood, and we did see that there was quite a gap in expenditures.

06:30:13.900 --> 06:30:22.620
For a 2018-19 year, today's Fresh Start, Inglewood, was spending $9,500 per pupil,

06:30:22.620 --> 06:30:29.900
where the comparable schools that we were comparing them to were spending between $12,000 and $19,000

06:30:29.900 --> 06:30:34.940
per pupil, so there's quite a large spending gap in expenditures at the school.

06:30:37.900 --> 06:30:45.580
Academic renewal criteria under Education Code 47607. The authority that granted the charter

06:30:45.580 --> 06:30:50.220
shall consider increases in pupil academic achievement for all groups of pupils as the

06:30:50.220 --> 06:30:54.940
most important factor, and the entity that granted the charter determines that the academic performance

06:30:54.940 --> 06:30:58.780
of the charter school is at least equal to the academic performance of the public schools of

06:30:58.780 --> 06:31:03.020
the charter school pupils would otherwise have been required to attend. I'm going to take my mask

06:31:03.020 --> 06:31:09.420
off just for a second because I have to, I have to breathe. Deep breaths for a second.

06:31:10.860 --> 06:31:16.540
The Department of Education findings, we select 11 schools serving similar grade spans where

06:31:16.540 --> 06:31:20.780
pupils would otherwise attend and that are comparable and that they have similar enrollment

06:31:20.780 --> 06:31:26.300
for similar significant subgroups. The CDE has determined that the CAS data demonstrates that

06:31:26.300 --> 06:31:31.580
TFSCSI does perform at least equal to the schools where the pupils would otherwise be required to

06:31:31.580 --> 06:31:38.300
attend. However, in general and statewide, this school is still academically low performing.

06:31:39.980 --> 06:31:45.820
You will see in our comparable schools that we did use schools in Inglewood as comparable schools

06:31:45.820 --> 06:31:53.900
and schools in LA Unified as comparable schools, as according to our data, a large proportion of

06:31:53.900 --> 06:32:03.420
their students at Inglewood actually would be LA Unified students. Moving on to their dashboard,

06:32:05.500 --> 06:32:11.980
their dashboard for 2018-19 and 19 in English Language Arts, you'll see that they were in

06:32:11.980 --> 06:32:21.180
yellow in 2018 and have gone down in 2019 to orange, so there was a decline in their colors

06:32:21.180 --> 06:32:28.940
for the dashboard. Mathematics had a slight increase but stayed in the same color range.

06:32:31.180 --> 06:32:40.540
There were decreases in CAS data when you look at the ELA and math scores for the various

06:32:40.940 --> 06:32:49.660
pupil groups that attend the school. There were decreases, some more significant than others,

06:32:50.460 --> 06:32:57.100
but specifically in ELA for the socioeconomically and for

06:32:58.220 --> 06:33:02.940
in ELA for Hispanic Latino students decreased significantly.

06:33:02.940 --> 06:33:12.780
Ed Code 52052F allows charter schools to use alternative measures that show increases in

06:33:12.780 --> 06:33:17.180
pupil academic achievement for all groups of pupils school-wide and among significant

06:33:18.780 --> 06:33:22.700
subgroups in order to meet renewal requirements. The CDE reviewed the alternative measures

06:33:22.700 --> 06:33:27.500
information provided by Today's Fresh Start. The data shows that Today's Fresh Start alternative

06:33:27.500 --> 06:33:43.180
measures reflect some increases in their CAS, LPAC, and RFEP. Among the charter elements that

06:33:44.460 --> 06:33:49.420
we reviewed, CDE finds that Today's Fresh Start Inglewood does not provide a reasonably comprehensive

06:33:49.420 --> 06:33:53.340
description of the following required charter elements. Description of their educational

06:33:53.420 --> 06:33:58.300
program, the governance structure, suspension and expulsion procedures, and dispute resolution

06:33:58.300 --> 06:34:06.380
procedures. In terms of their educational program, it lacks description of a comprehensive English

06:34:06.380 --> 06:34:11.180
learner plan. Projected enrollment does not include the number of TK pupils and special

06:34:11.180 --> 06:34:16.300
education services does not include sufficient information to show a continuum of services.

06:34:18.300 --> 06:34:22.460
In terms of the governance structure, their bylaws reflect non-compliance with the Brown Act

06:34:22.460 --> 06:34:27.260
requirement allows regular meetings to be held without notice and no requirement for public notice

06:34:27.260 --> 06:34:32.460
of special meetings. The Today's Fresh Start conflict of interest code reflect non-compliance

06:34:32.460 --> 06:34:37.420
with the political reform act includes exceptions and definitions that are contrary to government

06:34:37.420 --> 06:34:42.620
code 1090 incorrectly relies on California corporations code rather than government code

06:34:42.620 --> 06:34:50.700
section 1090 which is now required. In conclusion, CDE staff recommends denial of the Today's Fresh

06:34:50.700 --> 06:34:55.580
Start Inglewood petition. The petition is unlikely to successfully implement the intended program

06:34:55.580 --> 06:35:00.220
based on involvement of current governance concerns and past history of fiscal mismanagement.

06:35:00.220 --> 06:35:04.780
The petition does not provide reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all the required elements.

06:35:07.980 --> 06:35:08.860
And that concludes

06:35:12.220 --> 06:35:13.020
my presentation.

06:35:13.020 --> 06:35:20.620
Thank you very much Stephanie. This is the opening of the public hearing. I declare the

06:35:20.620 --> 06:35:26.460
public hearing open as of 438 p.m. First we'll hear from the petitioners. The petitioners will

06:35:26.460 --> 06:35:32.060
have 12 minutes. Then we'll hear from the district and county that are opposing the renewal petition.

06:35:32.060 --> 06:35:37.420
They will also have a total of 12 minutes. After the presentations from both sides there will then

06:35:37.500 --> 06:35:42.540
After the presentations from both sides there will then be an opportunity for public comment

06:35:42.540 --> 06:35:49.500
from any individual who has not already presented for one minute each. So we'll hear now from the

06:35:49.500 --> 06:35:59.500
petitioners.

06:36:07.420 --> 06:36:25.180
Hi there. Can you hear and see me?

06:36:29.260 --> 06:36:35.340
I saw some nods. So I guess I'll go ahead and get started. So good afternoon board members. My name

06:36:35.340 --> 06:36:40.620
is Janelle Rooley. I'm an attorney with the law offices of Yonge Indian Court. Another day of first

06:36:40.620 --> 06:36:45.180
speaking to you through a mask. So to kick things off I wanted to first dispense with a couple of

06:36:45.180 --> 06:36:50.700
the items that are more legal in nature. First of all the law applicable to this renewal tells us

06:36:50.700 --> 06:36:55.500
that increases in subgroup academic achievement is the most important factor. Again the most

06:36:55.500 --> 06:37:01.340
important factor in determining whether to grant renewal. Today's fresh start has documented those

06:37:01.340 --> 06:37:07.660
increases in the past and will do so again today for you in great detail. Crucially the CDE also

06:37:07.660 --> 06:37:11.820
found that today's fresh start met this academic threshold criteria. So we're in agreement there.

06:37:12.540 --> 06:37:17.180
Second you may hear today and have heard already about claims of past performance that was

06:37:17.180 --> 06:37:23.020
unsuccessful or maybe allegations of conflicts of interest. Ultimately these claims what they

06:37:23.020 --> 06:37:29.580
boil down to is smoke but without any fire. So the district county and the CDE have all stated

06:37:29.580 --> 06:37:33.420
that the today's fresh start charter the county-wide benefit charter was revoked.

06:37:34.220 --> 06:37:40.140
That's the exact same charter that the state board approved in 2010. I was there. I personally was

06:37:40.140 --> 06:37:45.340
there. This the state board cannot renew a charter that was revoked. It just can't happen. So it

06:37:45.340 --> 06:37:51.980
wasn't revoked. Next the today's fresh start Inglewood operates at a facility that was

06:37:51.980 --> 06:37:55.820
constructed with support from the charter school facilities program. That's the building where we

06:37:55.820 --> 06:38:01.900
are all today. The district has made allegations about a lease that the Compton school a separate

06:38:01.900 --> 06:38:06.220
charter school entered into. That particular property was acquired by the parkers in the

06:38:06.220 --> 06:38:12.140
1960s and used and it was used to provide free education to socioeconomically disadvantaged

06:38:12.140 --> 06:38:18.060
students. That property is held in a family trust and it's leased at or below market rate to a

06:38:18.060 --> 06:38:24.140
preschool and then eventually sublet to Compton, TFS Compton. The site ownership has never been

06:38:24.140 --> 06:38:28.700
concealed and indeed the site was approved by the state board in 2010 again as part of that

06:38:28.700 --> 06:38:35.020
county-wide renewal and the fair political practices commission made a determination that

06:38:35.020 --> 06:38:40.700
that the that the arrangement was lawful. All of that is documented in your papers.

06:38:42.140 --> 06:38:45.820
Last you might hear about a construction contract that's related to the Inglewood site.

06:38:46.620 --> 06:38:52.300
This construction project or contract is complete. The contract is expired. There's no live contract

06:38:52.300 --> 06:38:57.980
here. The construction company employed Dr. Parker's husband so there was a financial interest

06:38:57.980 --> 06:39:02.860
but it was properly disclosed contemporaneously both to the state board and to the office of public

06:39:02.860 --> 06:39:08.140
school construction. All of these issues can be explained in a way that really does sound scary

06:39:08.140 --> 06:39:12.380
however the facts are that no authority with jurisdiction has actually found a conflict of

06:39:12.380 --> 06:39:16.940
interest. So with that out of the way I want to turn this over to Dr. Codio who's going to tell

06:39:16.940 --> 06:39:23.180
you all about the academics. Good afternoon esteemed board allow us to show you a video

06:39:23.180 --> 06:39:34.940
about how great today's fresh start is. The great Maya Angelou said hope is born again in the faces

06:39:34.940 --> 06:39:40.380
of children. We see that at today's fresh start charter school in Inglewood which serves more

06:39:40.380 --> 06:39:45.740
than 500 predominantly Latinx and African American students with a rich personalized

06:39:45.740 --> 06:39:51.020
learning experience. From the moment children begin at today's fresh start they know they're

06:39:51.020 --> 06:39:57.820
in a special place where they're wrapped in support and learning is a joy. In safe clean

06:39:57.820 --> 06:40:02.940
modern classrooms the school's student scholars rise to meet the expectations of performance.

06:40:03.900 --> 06:40:08.940
TFS academic scores rank well above other schools in the Inglewood Unified School District.

06:40:08.940 --> 06:40:14.620
The focus on technology helps prepare students for their futures.

06:40:15.420 --> 06:40:21.580
All students are provided with laptop computers and instructors use interactive Promethean boards.

06:40:22.460 --> 06:40:28.300
Today's fresh start welcomes students with special needs. They benefit from caring on-site resource

06:40:28.300 --> 06:40:34.300
specialists counselors and psychologists who provide patient holistic services. Students

06:40:34.300 --> 06:40:39.020
especially love the state-of-the-art gymnasium. On any day of the week you can find children

06:40:39.020 --> 06:40:44.860
playing sports and games engaging in after-school activities attending school dances and enjoying

06:40:44.860 --> 06:40:50.140
other activities. When school is not in session the gym is often used by members of the community.

06:40:51.340 --> 06:41:00.140
TFS offers a nurturing environment for students and ESL students helping them to face and

06:41:00.220 --> 06:41:05.420
surmount challenges outside of school. Rather than using harsh or punitive discipline teachers

06:41:05.420 --> 06:41:10.620
talk to students about their home lives and take an interest in their future. Today's fresh start

06:41:10.620 --> 06:41:16.220
Inglewood is dedicated to its mission of preparing students as lifelong learners to participate

06:41:16.220 --> 06:41:23.980
responsibly in a diverse and changing world. Hello again my name is Pierre Cotillo and I will be

06:41:23.980 --> 06:41:28.540
discussing the rest of this presentation to show that today's fresh start should remain open for

06:41:28.540 --> 06:41:33.100
years to come. First of all let's talk about our governance structure. Our governance is controlled

06:41:33.100 --> 06:41:37.980
by five very experienced community-minded people and you see their accomplished names on your

06:41:37.980 --> 06:41:44.540
screen. Complete with knowledge in education law finance and government. Our board does a great job

06:41:44.540 --> 06:41:49.260
of making sure that our parents are represented. One board overseeing multiple charters which was

06:41:49.260 --> 06:41:53.900
something that was discussed is the standard practice in the charter world and yearly our

06:41:53.980 --> 06:41:57.900
board received Brown Act training and compliance with legal guidelines.

06:42:00.220 --> 06:42:05.820
We're also an award-winning school. Look at that screen that you're seeing. This is not an

06:42:05.820 --> 06:42:11.260
exhaustive list. We've received commendations from the National Association of Special Education

06:42:11.260 --> 06:42:16.300
Teachers for our special education process and how we do as a school. We've also been received

06:42:16.300 --> 06:42:21.020
commendations from Innovate Public Schools as a top school of choice for children of color.

06:42:21.020 --> 06:42:26.300
We're also part of National Honor Society fully accredited by WASC and our students are sought

06:42:26.300 --> 06:42:32.140
after by some of the most prestigious high schools in California and quite frankly the country.

06:42:32.140 --> 06:42:37.260
Our school is raising the bar and closing the achievement gap. Also looking at our dashboard

06:42:37.260 --> 06:42:44.060
you will see that we have a great school culture. TFSESI has achieved blue since the inception of

06:42:44.060 --> 06:42:49.420
the dashboard on suspension and expulsions because we believe in counseling and mentoring our

06:42:49.420 --> 06:42:57.020
scholars and their families. With regard to the ability of successfully implementing the program

06:42:57.020 --> 06:43:03.100
as we stated to you in our April 3rd letter our education program undeniably works as it relates

06:43:03.100 --> 06:43:08.460
to everything that we do because of our cash scores and now I'd like to take this time to

06:43:08.460 --> 06:43:13.340
discuss our authorizer Englewood and the challenges they themselves are dealing with.

06:43:13.980 --> 06:43:19.340
Englewood has been dealing with many many many many challenges. First of all with the closure

06:43:19.340 --> 06:43:25.180
of Freeman Elementary in 2013. Also with the closure of Monroe and we'll talk about that in

06:43:25.180 --> 06:43:31.180
a moment in 2018. The closure and the reframing of Woodworth to become Woodworth Monroe at that

06:43:31.180 --> 06:43:37.180
same time and now they're about to have experienced possibly another closure with Warren Lane Elementary

06:43:37.180 --> 06:43:42.940
School and of course TFSES Englewood has been a stable consistent high performing school in the

06:43:42.940 --> 06:43:50.780
Englewood community. As it relates to our ELA scores you see from our 2018-19 data and you see

06:43:50.780 --> 06:43:57.100
that trend line of all comparable 7th and 8th grade schools within Englewood and you see very

06:43:57.100 --> 06:44:02.220
clearly that our scores are outpacing everything that's happening in Englewood Unified School

06:44:02.220 --> 06:44:08.380
District as well as the district as a whole. The same story also bears true for math where you're

06:44:08.380 --> 06:44:13.420
seeing all the different schools from Hewlett-Pane all the way down to Warren Lane how we are

06:44:13.420 --> 06:44:18.540
performing as an institution. We are raising the bar and closing the achievement gap for our

06:44:18.540 --> 06:44:25.740
scholars. When you're looking at comparable Los Angeles Unified Schools the same story bears out

06:44:25.740 --> 06:44:30.540
but today's fresh start the 3rd to 5th grade cluster outpacing the 3rd to 5th grade clusters

06:44:30.540 --> 06:44:36.060
of our comparison schools doing the very same thing for ELA for 6th to 8th grade.

06:44:38.380 --> 06:44:44.940
When you look at our math scores again the same story bears out Honorable Ward with TFSES Englewood

06:44:44.940 --> 06:44:51.900
outpacing our other comparable schools. We are indeed the highest performing school from all

06:44:51.900 --> 06:44:56.380
the comparable schools that we've received in middle school as well as elementary because again

06:44:56.380 --> 06:45:00.540
we believe in raising the bar and closing the achievement gap for all of our scholars.

06:45:01.580 --> 06:45:06.060
So again let's go back to talking about how Englewood closures impacted our school community.

06:45:06.940 --> 06:45:11.500
If you take a look at the dashboard here you will see when Monroe closed in 2018

06:45:12.460 --> 06:45:18.060
June 30th to be exact they're one mile north of today's fresh start. So when they refrain

06:45:18.060 --> 06:45:23.500
Woodworth Elementary to become Woodworth Monroe naturally all their children did not just transfer

06:45:23.500 --> 06:45:29.660
from Monroe over to Woodworth Monroe. Many of their children over 50 of them enrolled in today's

06:45:29.660 --> 06:45:37.340
fresh start and because of their performance as you can see clearly identified here with very very

06:45:37.340 --> 06:45:42.620
very low points from distance from standard you will see that when they came to us they improved

06:45:42.620 --> 06:45:50.060
greatly. We were able to take their score from 83.4 points distance from standard in the 2018

06:45:50.060 --> 06:46:00.860
testing year I'm sorry up to 74.4 points following year 2000. You'll also see as you accurately

06:46:00.860 --> 06:46:05.660
stated earlier that we were able to make gains within the same population with regard to math.

06:46:05.660 --> 06:46:10.380
So again we are raising the bar and closing the achievement gap for our scholars but it's got us

06:46:10.380 --> 06:46:15.340
to thinking how are all of our scholars doing once they transfer to us from other institutions.

06:46:15.980 --> 06:46:20.700
So here's the information here when students transfer from other institutions that weren't

06:46:20.700 --> 06:46:26.300
doing them well or they weren't serving their their students well when they came to us you

06:46:26.300 --> 06:46:31.980
see the trend line of improvement started with 74.7 distance from standard intake when they're

06:46:31.980 --> 06:46:38.460
with us for one year 53.5 all the way to three years plus we're closing the gap for our kids.

06:46:39.020 --> 06:46:44.860
The same issue the same story I'm sorry bears true for math with our children closing the gap the

06:46:44.860 --> 06:46:51.580
longer they're with us. So we know for a fact if we had those Monroe children earlier we would have

06:46:51.580 --> 06:46:56.940
closed that gap even further because of our process in our program and how excellent our

06:46:56.940 --> 06:47:02.380
how excellent we do things. Looking at it from distance from standard for the very same thing

06:47:03.020 --> 06:47:09.020
the very same thing in ELA the third through fifth all that information bears the same way

06:47:09.020 --> 06:47:15.180
with our students outperforming both Englewood Unified as well as LA Unified comparable schools.

06:47:15.900 --> 06:47:20.300
Again that's true for our students in ELA for sixth through eighth grade and you'll see that

06:47:20.300 --> 06:47:27.980
also true for math third through fifth sixth through eighth. CCSA and the California Charter

06:47:27.980 --> 06:47:33.660
Schools Association also stated that our school meets the minimal criteria and if you see it on

06:47:33.660 --> 06:47:40.140
your screen and we qualify for renewal support based on academics because again of how we do

06:47:40.140 --> 06:47:45.500
business we raise the bar we close the achievement gap we counsel our students we keep our students

06:47:45.500 --> 06:47:51.180
in classrooms and we do right by our kids. Analysis does continuity and learning because

06:47:51.180 --> 06:47:55.260
this is a very important piece of what we're doing in terms of moving forward. Today's fresh start is

06:47:55.260 --> 06:48:00.460
focused on strengthening our academic program in the midst of our COVID-19 outbreak following all

06:48:00.460 --> 06:48:05.500
regulations and guidelines. Within two weeks and that is not a misprint within two weeks of the

06:48:05.500 --> 06:48:12.140
national emergency 97 percent of our scholars were engaged in online learning because we provided

06:48:12.140 --> 06:48:17.340
computers to them and had all their classes transition from what's happening here at the

06:48:17.340 --> 06:48:22.700
school site into Google Classroom and synchronous classes happening daily through Zoom. We also

06:48:22.700 --> 06:48:27.500
again as I shared provided computer devices and we're not stopping there. We're creating partnerships

06:48:27.500 --> 06:48:33.100
with T-Mobile. We also did a formative assessment in June to see exactly where our students were

06:48:33.100 --> 06:48:38.700
prior to them leaving and we will repeat that same assessment in the fall to see what happened over

06:48:38.700 --> 06:48:42.860
the summer so we can plan effectively for our scholars. We're also going to be purchasing new

06:48:42.860 --> 06:48:48.700
laptops so the students will be able to take their laptops home and also stay with us. Thank you so

06:48:48.700 --> 06:48:51.660
much. Today's fresh start should remain open. Thank you.

06:48:57.820 --> 06:49:01.820
Are you still talking? Sorry, thank you.

06:49:04.380 --> 06:49:11.100
We want to move now to the district county representatives.

06:49:18.700 --> 06:49:35.100
Let us know when you'd like us to begin.

06:49:36.220 --> 06:49:41.180
When you're ready. Okay, thank you. Do you have a slide that you want to be showing because I

06:49:41.180 --> 06:49:49.420
don't see one. Yes, I'm sharing my screen. We're just seeing a black

06:49:53.660 --> 06:49:55.020
black screen at the moment.

06:49:57.980 --> 06:50:04.380
Let me try it again. Maybe unshare and then reshare. Yeah, thank you.

06:50:04.380 --> 06:50:13.900
Thank you. How about now? We can see it. Excellent. So glad.

06:50:25.980 --> 06:50:32.140
Are you unmuted? Okay, I'm unmuted. Can you hear me? Yes. Yes. Good afternoon,

06:50:32.140 --> 06:50:36.540
honorable board members. My name is Dr. Erica Torres and I serve as the proud

06:50:36.540 --> 06:50:41.500
county administrator of the Inglewood Unified School District. We at Inglewood Unified are

06:50:41.500 --> 06:50:47.740
very passionate about education and putting our students first, all students first. We have

06:50:47.740 --> 06:50:54.060
students, teachers, administrators, and parents all seeking to be heard today to support our district.

06:50:56.300 --> 06:51:01.900
Contrary to what today's fresh start has shared, Inglewood Unified is actually on the right.

06:51:02.540 --> 06:51:08.700
Students in Inglewood have choice. The district is transforming with amazing outcomes for students

06:51:08.700 --> 06:51:15.260
and we have many other charter schools within our district. We are ensuring that every student,

06:51:15.260 --> 06:51:20.860
regardless of race, ethnicity, special needs are treated with care and respect and are able

06:51:20.860 --> 06:51:27.660
to learn in a safe and nurturing environment. Inglewood has nine charter schools, two were not

06:51:27.660 --> 06:51:35.580
renewed. Both with academic performance issues, TFS appealed. The decision by Children of Promise

06:51:35.580 --> 06:51:41.980
did not. Today's fresh start is operated by Jeanette Parker. Jeanette Parker is married

06:51:41.980 --> 06:51:49.500
to Clark Parker. The Parkers also operate other for-profit companies that contrast with TFS.

06:51:50.220 --> 06:51:55.980
The state board regulations require consideration of past performance and whether a charter school

06:51:55.980 --> 06:52:03.980
has had an unsuccessful history. TFS has an unsuccessful history including misconduct.

06:52:04.620 --> 06:52:11.740
TFS was revoked by LACO for a myriad of violations including the same conduct TFS has continued to

06:52:11.740 --> 06:52:18.300
pursue under its current charter. Violation of conflict of interest laws and self-dealing,

06:52:18.300 --> 06:52:25.820
including violation of governance requirements and Brown Act and fiscal mismanagement. TFS has

06:52:25.820 --> 06:52:32.300
pursued unsuccessful litigation against LACO. The state and Inglewood unified. This simply

06:52:32.300 --> 06:52:37.820
shows no regard for compliance which translates into a failure to put students first and ensure

06:52:37.820 --> 06:52:42.940
them the education that they're entitled to receive. Our community and students deserve

06:52:42.940 --> 06:52:50.300
better than TFS. We are a district on the rise and expect integrity, compliance and collaboration

06:52:50.380 --> 06:52:58.780
with our education partners. TFS has repeatedly asserted that it was not revoked. It was in fact

06:52:58.780 --> 06:53:05.660
revoked as confirmed by chief counsel for this board. This is also confirmed in the LACO board

06:53:05.660 --> 06:53:13.100
minutes. Dr. Sforza. Yes thank you so much Dr. Torres and thank you Auguste board members

06:53:14.380 --> 06:53:18.540
for listening to us today. I am Dr. Tanyan Sforza the president of the Inglewood Unified School

06:53:18.540 --> 06:53:23.580
District Board of Education and a UC Region Emeritus. You know I really want to thank you

06:53:23.580 --> 06:53:28.460
all for hearing us out as we take the time to share our concerns with you about the Parkers

06:53:29.020 --> 06:53:33.260
as well as today's fresh start because this the self-dealing concerns we have with their

06:53:33.820 --> 06:53:38.460
charter operations is not new. As reported by a teacher of today's fresh start students go

06:53:38.460 --> 06:53:44.620
without internet adequate supplies or even books and yet rather than invest in students education

06:53:44.620 --> 06:53:49.820
today's fresh start has amassed a multi-million dollar reserve and the Parkers pay themselves

06:53:49.820 --> 06:53:53.500
well over a million dollars annually through salary and contracts.

06:53:56.300 --> 06:54:01.660
In fact today's fresh start make local and national news with their self-dealing

06:54:01.660 --> 06:54:05.740
including being named by the Washington Post as one of the five most serious

06:54:05.740 --> 06:54:09.500
charter school scandals in 2019 nationally.

06:54:09.820 --> 06:54:15.020
You know it's not good for students and it's not good for charter schools generally to have bad

06:54:15.020 --> 06:54:20.940
actors enriching themselves in the name of charter schools. You know as a as a native of Inglewood

06:54:20.940 --> 06:54:27.340
who very much cares about our children who has my own children in our schools I want to ensure

06:54:27.820 --> 06:54:33.740
that all children in our district have access to institutions that are providing a great education

06:54:34.220 --> 06:54:39.100
to institutions that are providing a great education for them and are ensuring that we're

06:54:39.100 --> 06:54:44.620
maintaining integrity in our operations. Today's fresh start is not a good steward of the sector.

06:54:49.100 --> 06:54:55.740
With a history like TFS we would hope to see lessons learned and corrected conduct however

06:54:55.740 --> 06:55:01.820
the deficiencies with their practices and the charter itself are ongoing and extremely serious.

06:55:02.300 --> 06:55:07.180
Despite efforts to close their financial benefits one of the TFS school sites

06:55:07.180 --> 06:55:12.540
is owned by the Parkers who lease the property to Los Angeles School Services Inc

06:55:12.540 --> 06:55:19.340
who in turn leases to TFS. TFS is paying approximately 800,000 in rent annually.

06:55:19.980 --> 06:55:26.380
The Parkers financially benefit from contracts between TFS and a construction management company

06:55:26.460 --> 06:55:32.860
owned and operated by the Parkers. This is not putting the school and its students first.

06:55:33.820 --> 06:55:39.340
TFS's board is not in control and there is a lack of transparency in their governance.

06:55:40.060 --> 06:55:45.900
They skirt the law at every opportunity wrongfully operating a school outside the

06:55:45.900 --> 06:55:51.980
district and unsuccessfully suing the district when they try to hold them to the requirements

06:55:51.980 --> 06:55:56.780
of the law. These failures are serious and undermine the education

06:55:56.780 --> 06:56:00.860
for all of our students including those with disabilities.

06:56:04.940 --> 06:56:09.660
Good afternoon my name is Dr. Bernadette Lucius, chief academic officer for the

06:56:09.660 --> 06:56:14.860
Eaglewood Unified School District. In reviewing the renewal petition academic performance was

06:56:14.860 --> 06:56:20.780
considered as the most important factor but critically TFS refused to cooperate with the

06:56:20.780 --> 06:56:29.500
district even refusing to provide the 18-19 CASC data. TFS asserted it was embargoed even though

06:56:29.500 --> 06:56:34.940
state superintendent Thurmond instructed charter schools in writing to share it with their

06:56:34.940 --> 06:56:41.500
authorizers. TFS was trying to hide the serious declines. Now they claim the district did not

06:56:41.500 --> 06:56:46.860
consider the performance which is untrue. On the day of the decision the data was obtained from the

06:56:46.860 --> 06:56:51.980
state and was incorporated in the district's consideration and decision. That data and the

06:56:51.980 --> 06:56:59.500
county administrator's consideration is part of the record. The next slide clearly shows double

06:56:59.500 --> 06:57:06.700
digit declines in nearly every grade. The decline in 2018-2019 is shown here but the decline in both

06:57:06.700 --> 06:57:13.500
ELA and math performance was a trend over the five-year term. TFS did not demonstrate increases in

06:57:13.500 --> 06:57:18.780
academic performance for all students. This is a social justice issue for students in our district.

06:57:19.820 --> 06:57:27.500
The declines were in every subgroup as indicated on this slide served by TFS with EL and Hispanic

06:57:27.500 --> 06:57:36.620
pupils declining in the double digit. The LACO board like Eaglewood found that TFS did not

06:57:37.180 --> 06:57:42.220
meet the academic requirements for renewal and unanimously denied the renewal petition.

06:57:44.300 --> 06:57:49.740
My name is Aba Nghissa and I'm a teacher in Eaglewood and also the president of the

06:57:49.740 --> 06:57:55.100
Eaglewood Teacher's Association. The special education violations the district witnessed were

06:57:55.100 --> 06:58:01.580
particularly alarming. When visiting the school the TFS special education administrator was asked

06:58:01.580 --> 06:58:07.580
how they address the needs of students with severe disabilities or that enroll with an IEP that

06:58:07.580 --> 06:58:13.900
requires a specialty class. She responded that they send them back to their home district,

06:58:14.540 --> 06:58:22.140
a clear violation. Review of the disaggregated data provided by TFS shows that TFS serves a

06:58:22.140 --> 06:58:28.060
smaller number and a smaller percentage of special needs students and primarily students with mild

06:58:28.060 --> 06:58:33.980
disabilities. TSF reported no students with intellectual disabilities. The district also

06:58:33.980 --> 06:58:39.020
found that the TFS numbers were skewed due to identifying the same student under multiple

06:58:39.020 --> 06:58:45.020
categories. So the disaggregated data even skews favorably to the TSF members.

06:58:47.900 --> 06:58:53.580
After careful review of all of the information and the input I found TFS did not provide the

06:58:53.580 --> 06:59:00.380
requisite information to be eligible for renewal and the CASC data did not demonstrate increases

06:59:00.380 --> 06:59:07.900
in academic performance for all subgroups. Dr. Scorza. Yes thank you. The local board which

06:59:07.900 --> 06:59:14.700
revoked today's fresh start charter in 2009 heard the TFS in good appeal. Ward member Alex Johnson

06:59:14.700 --> 06:59:19.580
was concerned with whether things have changed at the charter school since that time. Our

06:59:19.580 --> 06:59:27.340
consideration of all aspects of this appeal is because of students because we care for children

06:59:27.340 --> 06:59:34.940
because we want to see every child succeed every child receive a high quality education.

06:59:35.740 --> 06:59:41.420
And from my perspective as this one board member it means that we do not turn an eye

06:59:42.140 --> 06:59:51.180
to the glaring concerns that are raised in this petition. So my concerns

06:59:52.060 --> 06:59:59.020
uh rest as I said at the last meeting I asked the question what has changed?

07:00:06.860 --> 07:00:14.140
Excuse me. So since since you have worked since November which is a reasonable amount of time to

07:00:14.140 --> 07:00:20.060
make an assessment you can then uh give a perspective on whether or not this has been a

07:00:20.060 --> 07:00:26.620
board operating in name only. And I would not classify it as a board operating in name only

07:00:26.620 --> 07:00:29.740
but I also would not classify it as a board that is in full control.

07:00:35.500 --> 07:00:39.260
So the consultant that spoke on behalf of TFS responded.

07:00:39.260 --> 07:00:48.060
And confirmed that she would not classify the board as in full control.

07:00:50.380 --> 07:00:59.020
And when we look to the change we can see that that Dr. Alex Johnson was looking for we can see

07:00:59.020 --> 07:01:04.300
that it has not occurred. My name is Sueann Evans and I am legal counsel for the district.

07:01:05.020 --> 07:01:10.940
The Parkers have enriched themselves there's no question through the abuse of Dr. Jeanette

07:01:10.940 --> 07:01:20.540
Parker's position at TFS. Now the district has focused on particular transactions one being the

07:01:20.540 --> 07:01:27.820
leases between the Los Angeles school services and today's fresh start and the construction

07:01:28.380 --> 07:01:35.420
management services agreement with today's fresh start. These transactions are with companies that

07:01:35.420 --> 07:01:42.860
are owned and operated by Clark Parker Jeanette Parker's husband and operate out of property

07:01:42.860 --> 07:01:52.140
owned by the Parkers at 4508 Crenshaw which we will note in a few minutes is a site that

07:01:52.700 --> 07:01:58.700
today's fresh start also pays a lease for or has entered into a lease for.

07:01:59.980 --> 07:02:05.740
So this has gone on under this board it's been the same board for many many years at least five

07:02:05.740 --> 07:02:13.580
years and they reelect themselves. So we're not seeing any change we're not seeing a change

07:02:13.580 --> 07:02:20.700
in the governance even in the folks who are stepping up to the plate to run the program.

07:02:23.100 --> 07:02:31.020
Now where do we get this information all smoke no fire not true it comes from their own audits

07:02:31.020 --> 07:02:36.780
it's the Parkers audits that identify the related party transactions and the property leases with

07:02:36.780 --> 07:02:43.260
TFS and under these agreements TFS has paid companies again operated by the Parkers.

07:02:43.820 --> 07:02:53.900
Okay was that 12 minutes or did you give us 10 because my my clock is saying we have a little more time.

07:02:58.460 --> 07:03:04.140
That was 12 minutes okay thank you I'm gonna quickly finish.

07:03:04.780 --> 07:03:10.780
No there's time sorry.

07:03:13.500 --> 07:03:18.860
My comment and I'm going I'm not going to go through all the slides but I do want to point out

07:03:18.860 --> 07:03:30.300
that the these their own tax records show that they did not go through any of the procedures

07:03:30.300 --> 07:03:37.100
for related party transactions they didn't even acknowledge them on their tax forms so I'll stop

07:03:37.100 --> 07:03:43.980
there but we're available to answer questions and I know you all have copies of of our presentation.

schools act not only did today's fresh start fail to meet the academic eligibility requirement

07:09:06.300 --> 07:09:12.860
for renewal but other deficiencies as reflected in our written findings and as confirmed by laco

07:09:12.860 --> 07:09:19.980

07:10:18.540 --> 07:10:27.020

07:11:24.220 --> 07:11:31.180
executive board member we all know that when high achieving students are forced to attend lower

07:11:31.180 --> 07:11:38.300
achieving schools their academic performance significantly declines stanford university

07:11:38.300 --> 07:11:45.500
center for research on education outcomes credo found that the typical student in a

07:11:45.500 --> 07:11:52.780
charter school gains more learning in a year than his or her district school peer

07:11:53.420 --> 07:11:58.700
amounting to about 50 more days of learning and reading and an additional 79 days of learning

07:11:58.700 --> 07:12:06.380
and math today's fresh start has shown this progress and should not be closed because

07:12:06.380 --> 07:12:13.660

hello i'm cicely bingener i'm a kindergarten teacher with englewood

07:12:33.340 --> 07:12:39.980
um the apparatus of tss have a decade-long record of what amounts to robbery of pressures

07:12:39.980 --> 07:12:44.140
and limited state funds to enrich themselves on the backs of thousands of unsuspecting

07:12:44.140 --> 07:12:49.180
and vulnerable students and families as a mandated reporter i'm compelled to point out

07:12:49.180 --> 07:12:54.060
that using children to enrich yourself and for your pleasure is tantamount to nothing less

07:12:54.060 --> 07:13:00.300
than thinly veiled child molestation allowing even a single cent of taxpayer money to underwrite

07:13:00.300 --> 07:13:07.660
child molestation is unconscionable sb don't allow yourself to be groomed by these predators

07:19:33.100 --> 07:19:39.340
the closure of the school many families have been restless and uncomfortable thinking that they

07:19:39.340 --> 07:19:46.060
they have nowhere else to go the issue has so devastated them that they have received more

07:19:46.060 --> 07:19:53.340
than 50 calls from my relatives parents and friends who from their kids are in today's

07:19:53.340 --> 07:20:00.140
fresh charter school they were all expressing the hope is going to cause them because they feel

07:20:00.140 --> 07:20:07.020
they have no hope anywhere since all the schools around them usually have low scores in tests in

07:20:07.020 --> 07:20:12.860
fact there is no school you can compare with today's fresh charter school that that was why

07:20:12.860 --> 07:20:17.500
it was difficult for them in my mind i feel the issue of closing the school

07:20:17.500 --> 07:20:24.700
is mainly political if not i wonder why they have time in the impact of thank you speaker your time

to provide anything substantial to show us why or how or what he was doing in school she said he

07:22:12.060 --> 07:22:18.540
was doing fine he was a well-behaved student however she thought that he was doing fine where

07:22:18.540 --> 07:22:24.620
i thought that he was really below and needed additional support so i i didn't feel that the

miss mary von teacher and englewood unified school district i'm calling in support of the

07:22:50.220 --> 07:22:55.980
englewood unified school district LACO and CDE decision to deny the renewal of today's fresh start

07:22:55.980 --> 07:23:00.940
this public school is not providing the englewood residents with free and appropriate educational

07:23:00.940 --> 07:23:07.580
programs and ELL programming or special day classes this school is located in a minority

07:23:07.580 --> 07:23:13.500
community where these services are vital this policy is being used to weed out the students

07:23:13.500 --> 07:23:18.780
with the greatest needs our englewood children deserve better all today's fresh start students

07:23:19.660 --> 07:23:25.420

my membership i am compelled to fight for the renewal of today's fresh charter

07:24:08.620 --> 07:24:12.780
i believe that we are facing times like never before in this pandemic

07:24:12.780 --> 07:24:19.500
we are facing times like never before in this pandemic and i find it criminal that we would be

07:24:19.500 --> 07:24:26.700
taking away a viable option when education is being debated whether it be a hybrid online or

07:24:26.700 --> 07:24:33.660
face-to-face i believe that our students in englewood need every option that we can provide

07:24:33.660 --> 07:24:40.540
and today's first charter based on the academics that have been displayed earlier is a viable

07:24:40.620 --> 07:24:48.460
options for our students thank you very much thank you next speaker you're you're now unmuted

it this school has not been a good partner with the district and nothing about their interaction

07:34:22.220 --> 07:34:31.580
with the district could be characterized as even remotely cooperative their lack of cooperation

07:34:31.580 --> 07:34:39.020
with the district epitomizes their long-standing history of antagonism toward their

07:34:39.100 --> 07:34:46.300
authorities as well which includes a prior revocation of the los angeles county office

07:34:46.300 --> 07:34:55.740
of education the evidence has been presented both the inglewood unified school district board

07:34:56.380 --> 07:35:03.740

07:36:01.980 --> 07:36:08.540
their children's start was not fresh they indicated the school's environment was very chaotic

07:36:08.540 --> 07:36:14.140
and there were many behavior issues that were swept under the rug there were no positive

07:36:14.140 --> 07:36:20.860
behavior supports in place and their son was even injured in class and there was no contact made to

07:36:20.940 --> 07:36:28.140
them as parents from administration they also shared that the school's curricular resources were

07:36:28.140 --> 07:36:36.460
low and even students deaths were limited fast forward they shared with me that if they knew

07:36:36.460 --> 07:36:41.740

07:37:13.260 --> 07:37:18.700
their behavior is particularly egregious in light of the fact that our that our state is entering

into yet another budgetary crisis where each dollar for our public schools is invaluable

07:37:23.740 --> 07:37:27.740

07:37:27.740 --> 07:37:33.580
education however today's fresh starts unethical practices have been going on for years without

07:37:33.580 --> 07:37:39.420

unanimous agreement by the los angeles county board of education the los angeles time has several

07:37:56.380 --> 07:38:02.940

for the los angeles county board of education on the charter schools renewal during the public

07:38:33.420 --> 07:38:38.300
hearing today's fresh start was asked a simple question by board member johnson about what has

07:38:38.300 --> 07:38:43.900
changed since they were revoked in 2007 by the county board the board member wanted to know

07:38:43.900 --> 07:38:48.860
to what extent the charter school learns from its prior malfeasance with respect to its inadequate

07:38:48.860 --> 07:38:54.060
governance leading to self-dealing transactions and conflicts of interest the charter schools

07:38:54.060 --> 07:38:58.940
struggled and ultimately failed to provide a satisfactory answer in fact rather than answering

07:38:58.940 --> 07:39:04.620
the question they appear to defy the concern namely they claim that they that the revoked

07:39:04.620 --> 07:39:08.860
program was a different charter school than the one previously overseen by the county board

07:39:08.860 --> 07:39:13.900
despite having the same name same program same operators and same board today's fresh start

07:39:13.900 --> 07:39:19.260
simply does not reflect any intention to change instead the renewal documents and their prior

07:39:19.260 --> 07:39:25.900
history indicating intention to continue their problem course thank you please deny them thank

07:39:25.900 --> 07:39:32.380

breakfast and lunch for their children and i am also highly offended and concerned because was

07:41:21.900 --> 07:41:28.940

07:41:28.940 --> 07:41:36.220
be hired again by iusd these are the people today's fresh start hang out with it's about

07:41:36.300 --> 07:41:42.940
money it is not about the children and i'm tired of people coming into inglewood and trying to

07:41:43.500 --> 07:41:50.540
make money off our children enough is enough to the parkers the bishop young and everybody else

07:41:50.540 --> 07:41:57.580

07:44:21.580 --> 07:44:29.580
in other words while tfs was receiving ava funding to cover its payroll dr parker was claiming

07:44:29.660 --> 07:44:35.580
reimbursement from the state for these same employees including clark parker senate law

07:44:35.580 --> 07:44:40.620

hi my name is akita johnson and my son isaac attends today's fresh start i enrolled isaac

07:45:28.620 --> 07:45:32.380
at this school because we live in a country where black students are least likely to become

07:45:32.380 --> 07:45:37.260
proficient readers by third grade be placed in gifted and talented education programs be

07:45:37.260 --> 07:45:41.420
taught by credentialed teachers who share their cultural experiences even though this doubles the

07:45:41.420 --> 07:45:46.300
likelihood they can attend college and they are least likely to feel emotionally safe and valued

07:45:46.300 --> 07:45:51.500
this school provides these supports and refuses to follow the 60 year old trend of leading students

07:45:51.500 --> 07:45:56.620
black students in particular behind lost chains and transitions are realities that students of

07:45:56.620 --> 07:46:02.060
color know all too well and significantly devastate their life chances please don't introduce another

07:46:02.060 --> 07:46:07.900
disruption to our students by closing the doors of this school my son deserves better i looked

07:46:07.980 --> 07:46:13.740
around inglewood and south l.a for a school that was free that was clean that had resources and

07:46:13.740 --> 07:46:18.780

hi my name is yael girth and i'm a teacher in inglewood unified school district i previously

07:46:38.220 --> 07:46:48.220
taught at la tiara which is a k a k-8 school that does everything that fresh start says that they

07:46:48.220 --> 07:46:56.380
do there is nothing unique about what fresh start does and and you guys have even shown that their

07:46:56.380 --> 07:47:01.260
test scores are the same as us so they're not doing anything special i would like before you

07:47:01.260 --> 07:47:10.780
vote to take a look at anna phillips los angeles times for march 27th 2019 and that is one of the

07:47:10.780 --> 07:47:18.140
reasons why i am so against fresh start because they are making money off of those kids and not

07:47:18.140 --> 07:47:24.540
giving them all the resources that they need we in inglewood give every resource we can to help

07:47:24.540 --> 07:47:32.380
give every resource we can we have after school programs we have tutoring we have all kinds of

07:47:32.380 --> 07:47:38.060
things we have robotics they are not offering anything that we don't offer and we gave out

07:47:38.060 --> 07:47:43.980
laptops i even was one of the teachers who gave out laptops when we had to close our doors on

07:49:01.740 --> 07:49:06.380
a teacher for england unify school district and i'm urging the board to deny the charter today's

07:49:06.380 --> 07:49:12.060
fresh charter today's fresh charter school represents all the lowest standards of unethical

07:49:12.060 --> 07:49:19.180
behavior that is in well documented today and in the local media it is important that all schools

07:49:19.180 --> 07:49:25.100
whether public or charter are held to the same high ethical standards of behavior because

07:49:25.100 --> 07:49:30.460
education our children matters not only does their education matter but who educates

07:49:30.460 --> 07:49:36.220
educates our children also matters and it's time for the board to stop blinking and turn

07:49:36.220 --> 07:49:42.540
a blind eye to unethical behavior of such charters as today's fresh start so i urge you to deny

07:49:42.540 --> 07:49:49.180

hi my name is dr kane and i am a parent and an employee in inglewood unified school district i

08:03:28.220 --> 08:03:32.940
am asking to deny the charter renewal as the charter's purpose is to provide services that

08:03:32.940 --> 08:03:37.420
are unavailable in their home districts this is not the case as inglewood unified provides the

08:03:37.420 --> 08:03:43.340
same programs and a vast amount of programs district-wide as a parent you want what's best

08:03:43.340 --> 08:03:48.700
for your children that is why my four children have attended iusd since kindergarten with one

08:03:48.700 --> 08:03:53.740
entering her senior year in college this would not be possible if it were not for the love

08:03:53.740 --> 08:03:59.020
commitment from our teachers our staff and our community in inglewood unified school district

08:03:59.020 --> 08:04:05.420

this uh people from today's fresh start came to their school to get laptops that's a big lie

08:04:39.020 --> 08:04:44.460

08:04:44.460 --> 08:04:49.260
laptop my children got laptop and when it's not okay we go back to school and we change it we did

hi my name is sensu iron i'm a teacher from inglewood i am calling to oppose the renewal

08:05:33.180 --> 08:05:39.500
of today's fresh start charter this school does not deserve to have this charter renewed

08:05:39.580 --> 08:05:43.900
evidences indicate that the school has historically been doing shady business

08:05:44.700 --> 08:05:50.700
not putting the students needs before the gains of their leaders this charter school is not

08:05:50.700 --> 08:05:56.380
servicing the community's total student population including those students with severe disabilities

08:05:57.020 --> 08:06:03.740
who are sent away to their home school in addition erratic academic performances is one more reason

08:06:03.820 --> 08:06:09.900
enough to deny the renewal of the school instead i would like to invite the current students

08:06:09.900 --> 08:06:15.580
to attend the inglewood unified school district our caring and dedicated teachers and staff

08:06:15.580 --> 08:06:22.140

towards today's fresh start charter faith of a mustard seed will um shall prevail

08:10:33.740 --> 08:10:39.740
i would like to request that our school receives their renewal the benefits of keeping our school

08:10:39.740 --> 08:10:47.660
open in my opinion well outweighs the risk of closing our school it is my belief that today's

08:10:47.660 --> 08:10:56.140
fresh start academy anklewood sites will continue top quality service services helping students to

08:10:56.140 --> 08:11:03.180

next speaker you are now unmuted and your time starts now my name is julie safe i don't know how

08:11:34.220 --> 08:11:39.900
much longer the inglewood community has to be quiet about today's fresh start illegal activities

08:11:40.780 --> 08:11:48.060
one of my children goes to animal charter and another one is at calso elementary school in iusd

08:11:49.260 --> 08:11:54.940
today's fresh start is not an educational partner dedicated to students instead the priority is to

08:11:54.940 --> 08:12:03.260
enrich the parkers their fiscal misconduct has allowed to be occurred by their board

08:12:03.260 --> 08:12:09.180
and their failure to put students first is why i did not put my children in that school

08:12:10.300 --> 08:12:17.660
i am asking that the board does the right thing by the students of inglewood and deny the charter

08:12:18.780 --> 08:12:25.900
for today's fresh start send your child to a school in iusd or even animal inglewood

the criteria for renewal and for the sake of 500 families it would be unconscionable to close it

08:15:30.860 --> 08:15:34.700
emotions aside the fact remains that the school meets the academic and financial

08:15:34.700 --> 08:15:39.900
requirements for renewal while there's always room for improvement the school must be doing

08:15:39.900 --> 08:15:44.060
something right to meet those standards furthermore you're evaluating a charter school that

08:15:44.060 --> 08:15:48.540
has been around for some time while there are voices who speak in opposition there are countless

08:15:48.540 --> 08:15:52.620
boys and family who have stayed with the school for years and could use the stability of an

08:15:52.620 --> 08:15:56.860
established school and use in certain times especially looking forward to the transition to

08:15:56.860 --> 08:16:02.460
fall also safe are the jobs of many hard-working teachers and staff who have met expectations

08:16:02.460 --> 08:16:07.580
but would face non-existent job market despite meeting standards for the sake of those returning

08:16:07.580 --> 08:16:12.940
students and families and teachers please renew the charter as it meets the criteria for renewal

08:16:12.940 --> 08:16:19.660
thank you thank you speaker for your call next speaker you are now unmuted please state your

08:16:19.660 --> 08:16:29.420
name and affiliation for the record your time starts now hi my name is kelly stewart and i am

08:16:29.420 --> 08:16:35.740
a 13 year resident of inglewood and i am an educator i've taught for almost 15 years in

08:16:35.740 --> 08:16:41.340
similar communities as tfsds and i've seen what underperforming schools look like and today's

08:16:41.340 --> 08:16:46.700
fresh start is far from it they say that the purpose of education is to open the windows of

08:16:46.700 --> 08:16:53.820
the mind those windows are open at tfsds and we need more examples of schools that are successfully

08:16:53.820 --> 08:16:59.820
ran by people of color with intellect and compassion and also by teachers who care

08:16:59.820 --> 08:17:05.340
closing this school would be disruptive to the american dream of many families and it is a shame

08:17:05.340 --> 08:17:11.260
that this school is under unwarranted scrutiny and the biggest casualty is at schools that serve

08:17:11.260 --> 08:17:16.540
students well like this one are historically denied the chance to uplift and build black and

08:17:16.540 --> 08:17:22.540
brown and diverse and all students and families i strongly urge the renewal of today's fresh start

08:17:22.540 --> 08:17:29.020
charter school thank you thank you next speaker please state your name and affiliation for the

08:17:29.020 --> 08:17:31.980
record you are unmuted and your time starts now

08:17:36.380 --> 08:17:41.260
my name is destiny and i have two children at today's fresh start i implore the board to weigh

08:17:41.260 --> 08:17:47.180
more heavily what has been reported by the actual staff students and parents of today's fresh start

08:17:47.180 --> 08:17:51.820
not outside parties that have nothing to lose and everything to gain in the form of increased

08:17:51.820 --> 08:17:58.780
ada my children were provided with a touchscreen laptop during covid they have a full lab they have

08:17:58.780 --> 08:18:02.780
teachers of color they have black teachers they're all fully credentialed and this is

08:18:02.780 --> 08:18:08.220
not something that you see at school that have over a 40 black population and that might not

08:18:08.220 --> 08:18:13.740
mean a lot to other people but it means a lot to me my household in my community closing the door

08:18:13.740 --> 08:18:19.180
to that school to send a message that we don't care about schools that serve black students with

08:18:19.180 --> 08:18:28.220
that level of integrity the the commitment that i'm seeing to drag the parker seems very personal

08:18:28.220 --> 08:18:33.020
and political and our children should not be in the middle of that when their benchmarks are being

08:18:33.020 --> 08:18:39.500
met and they are cared for and being shown that they are valued i think time thank you

of today's fresh start charter school the school has proven themselves to be completely corrupt

08:19:07.260 --> 08:19:13.340
and more interested in enriching themselves in falsifying data than educating our children

08:19:13.340 --> 08:19:20.140

good afternoon my name is Tara Booth and i'm a proud Englewood Unified School District teacher

08:19:40.140 --> 08:19:46.620
let's give students a fresh start why are the leaders keeping more than three percent in the

08:19:46.620 --> 08:19:53.100
reserve it was stated earlier that Englewood schools spend twelve thousand dollars per pupil

08:19:53.100 --> 08:19:59.820
while pfs spends nine thousand dollars why don't they use some of that extra money to up their game

08:19:59.820 --> 08:20:07.980
and for the record Monroe did not close in 2018 Woodworth Monroe merged it was a merger

08:20:08.060 --> 08:20:16.700
Monroe never closed put that on the record and also iusd serves all students all students

08:20:16.700 --> 08:20:21.180
and you need to know that there are different levels of special ed not just rsp

08:20:21.180 --> 08:20:28.380
there are something called scc that pfs does not provide parents please stop by an Englewood school

08:20:28.380 --> 08:20:36.380
and give your child a fresh start thank you thank you speaker next speaker please state your name

08:20:36.380 --> 08:20:40.540

08:21:20.780 --> 08:21:27.740
Chamberlain i'm an iusd school public teacher it's already been stated but i want to state

08:21:27.740 --> 08:21:33.180
it again today fresh starts demonstrate that excuse me discriminates against students with

08:21:33.180 --> 08:21:37.740
moderate and severe disabilities by turning them away simply because the charter school's parents

08:21:37.740 --> 08:21:42.860
have expressed that they do not like special day classes they are not committed to educating all

08:21:42.860 --> 08:21:47.420
children like we are and in the end it is the district schools that ultimately bear the

08:21:47.420 --> 08:21:52.860
disproportionate impact of serving those who require the most need and attention i've also

08:21:52.860 --> 08:21:57.740
seen children return to district schools from today's fresh start and express that they did

08:21:57.740 --> 08:22:02.220
not receive the quality education that they deserve or that they have been pushed out of the

08:22:02.220 --> 08:22:07.500
school for wholly illegitimate reasons it is offensive to me as a teacher from a school

08:22:07.500 --> 08:22:13.020
district that needs all financial support that it can get that the founders of today's fresh start

08:22:13.740 --> 08:22:18.060
have continued to take public school dollars intended for the children in our community

08:22:18.060 --> 08:22:22.220
enrich themselves personally thank you speaker your time has now ended

08:22:23.580 --> 08:22:27.500

08:23:03.180 --> 08:23:10.140
we did provide for our students every day lunch every day i remember the lady that called a few

08:23:10.140 --> 08:23:16.060
and her impassioned plea she was at the last one so apparently they drag her up so she can say

08:23:16.060 --> 08:23:20.780
we don't serve lunch we served lunch even during easter break which you all didn't do

08:23:21.580 --> 08:23:28.380

peres i am the ceo chief operating officer for the amazing wood unified school district

08:24:33.740 --> 08:24:40.620
i urge this committee to continue to deny tfs it is not a coincidence that iusd laco board and

08:24:40.620 --> 08:24:46.460
an array of articles have been reaching exposing the disarray and fraud tcs has accrued physical

08:24:46.460 --> 08:24:53.580
misconduct on tfs 2017 irs form 990 they state they have no transactions involving current employees

08:24:53.580 --> 08:24:59.340
no transactions with uh family members no transactions with ality entity which is not

08:24:59.340 --> 08:25:04.940
only a lie but fraud they should be ashamed to know that they made national news and identified

08:25:04.940 --> 08:25:11.580
of the top five worst worst schools the lies continue through this pandemic we have

08:25:12.300 --> 08:25:19.180
welcomed our doors to all of tfs students and we continue to do so it is understandable employees

08:25:19.180 --> 08:25:24.780
from tfs are calling in to support tfs but the reality is they are only fighting for their job

08:25:24.780 --> 08:25:31.020

and affiliation good afternoon board members my name is dr angela i am a middle school teacher

08:26:06.540 --> 08:26:14.540
at tfs fts and have been an educator for over 25 years since my arrival at the school i have seen

08:26:14.540 --> 08:26:20.940
incredible work done by today's restart and what it does for its students since my arrival i have

08:26:20.940 --> 08:26:28.860
seen how education and instruction is personalized for the students and how the school and the

08:26:28.940 --> 08:26:36.860
organization offers culturally relevant and responsive education the students not only

08:26:36.860 --> 08:26:41.100
learn in class but are also encouraged to participate in extracurricular activities like

08:26:41.100 --> 08:26:48.700
sports choir and the french club the fact that students start as early as pk and end with eighth

08:26:48.700 --> 08:26:54.220
grade is a testament to the trust and satisfaction of the families we serve the continued enrollment

08:26:54.220 --> 08:26:58.940
allows parents and teachers to form bonds that are critical importance to the students growth

08:26:58.940 --> 08:27:05.260
and development like any school there are areas for improvement but to rush to close thank you

speaker hello yes you are now unmuted please state your name and affiliation for the record please

08:27:30.540 --> 08:27:35.260
my name is laraine richards and i represent the california teachers association cta recommends

08:27:35.260 --> 08:27:40.060
that the state board of education vote to deny the renewal petition for tfs as recommended by

08:27:40.060 --> 08:27:46.780
the cde and the accs for the following reasons fails to meet the academic requirements of renewal

08:27:46.780 --> 08:27:53.020
in the charter schools act from 2018 to 2019 the percent of students meeting and exceeding standards

08:27:53.020 --> 08:27:59.020
in ela declined for nearly every grade assessed scores declined for ela for every subgroup the

08:27:59.020 --> 08:28:05.020
percent of students meeting and exceeding standards for math declined in half of those grades assessed

08:28:05.100 --> 08:28:10.860
math scores declined for sped el and hispanic students cde staff does acknowledge that the

08:28:10.860 --> 08:28:16.220
tfs is academically low performing as a whole which is certainly not good enough for renewal

08:28:16.220 --> 08:28:21.340
considering the numerous concerns authorized hopping ethics issues non-compliance with the

08:28:21.340 --> 08:28:26.220
brown act and failure to be held accountable by or even minimally by the authorization

08:28:26.220 --> 08:28:31.740
state board should deny tfs thank you speaker you have now reached your time we appreciate your call

over the years many charter schools have been welcomed into the school district by

08:29:19.420 --> 08:29:26.380
the laco school board therefore there are many schools parents are have to choose from

08:29:26.380 --> 08:29:31.340
therefore only those schools with stellar records should be able to continue with their

08:29:31.340 --> 08:29:38.460
charter fresh start is not one of those they have had numerous complaints from both parents

08:29:38.460 --> 08:29:45.180
and teachers charter schools are publicly funded therefore they need to be highly scrutinized in

08:29:45.180 --> 08:29:50.540

08:30:22.540 --> 08:30:27.980
of charter is to inspire and innovate model schools and to teach those new strategies and share

08:30:27.980 --> 08:30:34.620

fresh start no longer are welcomed in our community we demand that our public schools and approved

08:30:55.100 --> 08:31:00.140

hello this is dina wilson from los angeles county office of education i'm pleased to be

08:33:55.660 --> 08:34:02.460
here today representing the county board not only does the county board have ample findings

08:34:03.500 --> 08:34:08.620
with substantial evidence to deny this charter we had previous experience with oversight

08:34:08.620 --> 08:34:16.460
of a tfs charter and did indeed revoke it in 2007 when reviewing this charter the county

08:34:16.460 --> 08:34:21.180
board did review academic improvement for all groups of pupils as the most important

08:34:21.180 --> 08:34:27.420
factor and found that the tfs inglewood failed to show increases for all groups of students

08:34:28.540 --> 08:34:34.060
additionally the charter continues to show concerns of conflict of interest

08:34:34.940 --> 08:34:42.060
self-dealing transactions and concerns about brown act compliance they do not show a commitment

08:34:42.060 --> 08:34:47.660
to equity as proven in their l cap a review of their most recent l cap shows that they have

08:34:47.660 --> 08:34:54.060
failed to properly identify actions and services funded by supplement one concentration funds

08:34:54.060 --> 08:35:00.060

son a 504 plan i actually had to take legal action and it took it took months and i had to

08:38:10.700 --> 08:38:15.340

thank you that concludes public comment

08:44:41.420 --> 08:44:46.220
okay um given that there is no other public comment we'll now close the public hearing

08:44:46.780 --> 08:44:51.580
and commence with the board discussion and action and first i'd like to ask ting

08:44:51.900 --> 08:44:54.620
our sb liaison if she has any initial comments

08:44:57.980 --> 08:45:03.740
um yes i'd be happy to i am wondering though if we feel like i don't want to drag this out

08:45:03.740 --> 08:45:08.300
longer the meeting out longer but um wonder if the board members want to take a break

08:45:08.300 --> 08:45:12.780
if this would be i think people are taking kind of a rolling break when they need a stretch

08:45:12.780 --> 08:45:19.020
or whatever because we have two items after this okay happy okay i'm happy to move forward

08:45:19.020 --> 08:45:29.180
so uh all right um again want to thank the public comments and for the speakers to have

08:45:29.180 --> 08:45:34.700
waited in the queue to make their comments especially so late in the evening afternoon

08:45:35.900 --> 08:45:45.820
as i stated in the other charter renewal item you know these i know that these issues are very

08:45:45.820 --> 08:45:53.260
emotional and it is very important that we do hear all of the public and their thoughts on

08:45:53.260 --> 08:46:00.940
this this issue so we are considering two charters renewals today with both similarities and

08:46:00.940 --> 08:46:08.460
significant differences both have a loyal group of local supporters both have adequate facilities

08:46:09.340 --> 08:46:15.260
both have strained relationships with their authorizers and both have varying degrees of

08:46:15.260 --> 08:46:21.420
um academic performance um and the varying degrees two varying degrees the the academic

08:46:21.420 --> 08:46:26.140
performance of both schools is better than the academic performance of comparison schools

08:46:27.660 --> 08:46:33.980
however as i stated earlier although academic performance is the most important factor for

08:46:33.980 --> 08:46:41.020
renewal there are other compelling factors that should not be ignored in a renewal decision

08:46:42.380 --> 08:46:49.500
um what i see here is the two schools and what i see is a distinguishing factor is that

08:46:49.500 --> 08:46:56.380
today's first start input has been in operations excuse me john henry has been uh was seeking its

08:46:56.380 --> 08:47:04.700
first renewal today's first start englund has been in operation since 2009 and uh the the today's

08:47:04.700 --> 08:47:13.020
first start uh organization has been operating schools since 2003 so a much longer history and

08:47:13.020 --> 08:47:21.260
track record i will say that uh i have concerned i have really deep concerns raised in the cde staff

08:47:21.260 --> 08:47:29.420
report um particularly for a school that has been operating this long and has had this history

08:47:30.300 --> 08:47:38.780
uh i am i'm going to be a bit open for more discussions i know that it was there was a

08:47:38.780 --> 08:47:44.860
lot of back and forth at the accs meeting and it is a very confusing given that the the history

08:47:44.860 --> 08:47:49.660
of the organization and the and the various schools that have been in operations and the

08:47:49.740 --> 08:47:54.860
county charter and all that so what i would encourage um board members to do is refer to

08:47:54.860 --> 08:48:02.220
appendix one in the item i uh the department of education has uh provided some clarification

08:48:02.780 --> 08:48:08.860
in that appendix one i think that might be helpful um in under for to clarify some of the matters

08:48:09.740 --> 08:48:18.060
that have been um discussed so with that uh i will leave it to my fellow board members to ask

08:48:18.060 --> 08:48:25.020
questions i'll ask our board members to raise your hand in the window i'm going to try to

08:48:25.020 --> 08:48:31.500
manage this and see i assume all of us listened and we have several areas we may want to comment

08:48:31.500 --> 08:48:39.500
about um and i guess i would ask member rucker i believe you're on did did you want to start

08:48:39.500 --> 08:48:40.540
with any comments

08:48:46.220 --> 08:48:57.580
can you hear me yes now we can thank you okay um so i do appreciate board members son

08:48:59.980 --> 08:49:09.260
comments to open this conversation and i do have multiple concerns but my concerns are about this

08:49:09.340 --> 08:49:15.660
charter are no different from the concerns that i have expressed in the past concerning

08:49:15.660 --> 08:49:23.740
previous charters and the issues related to those charters so i need to make sure i i really do want

08:49:23.740 --> 08:49:32.060
to make sure that for all of those parents and teachers and community members who called in to

08:49:32.060 --> 08:49:38.540
share their concerns and their passions about these schools and these programs it's really

08:49:38.540 --> 08:49:45.660
important to recognize today of all days why those passions and those concerns are being

08:49:45.660 --> 08:49:52.940
expressed um not every child has an opportunity to go through school not let me change that not

08:49:52.940 --> 08:49:58.460
every african american child not every african american parent has an opportunity to see a

08:49:58.460 --> 08:50:05.260
school and to see a school program that they actually feel wants and welcomes their child

08:50:05.340 --> 08:50:10.780
and they see their child succeeding many times african american parents when the children go

08:50:10.780 --> 08:50:15.900
to school and they show up in school and they come home and they're successful and they like school

08:50:15.900 --> 08:50:22.220
there's some kind of magic happening so for many of the parents who who have called in to express

08:50:22.220 --> 08:50:29.500
their concerns and success and support of the magic that is happening at today's fresh start

08:50:29.500 --> 08:50:37.740
i heard you and i understand that for you you have a great deal of support and you really are

08:50:37.740 --> 08:50:44.940
vested in the support and the success of your child at this school i equally heard from parents

08:50:44.940 --> 08:50:51.420
of students who didn't feel the same way who found the success that they needed in inglewood

08:50:51.420 --> 08:50:58.780
so this is not a conversation about where the magic is in public education because there is

08:50:59.340 --> 08:51:05.180
a formula or there is a moment a sense of connection that children who are successful

08:51:05.180 --> 08:51:10.620
and that african american children who find success and connection can find for many and

08:51:10.620 --> 08:51:16.060
multiple reasons whether it's at inglewood which we clearly heard and clearly understand

08:51:16.620 --> 08:51:21.020
and the innovations that they are offering both through link learning which i personally have

08:51:21.020 --> 08:51:26.300
awareness of and had the opportunity to help start as a field and as an area of study here

08:51:26.300 --> 08:51:31.420
in california or whether it's in the shop classes and the art classes that are supported

08:51:31.420 --> 08:51:35.900
through many high schools elementary schools and middle schools in inglewood as well as for the

08:51:35.900 --> 08:51:43.180
parents who found great success for their children at today's fresh start we sit on this panel and

08:51:43.180 --> 08:51:49.100
we have multiple metrics that have to be considered and that need to be considered to bring balance to

08:51:49.100 --> 08:51:55.340
this conversation and as board member song pointed out i had great reservation about

08:51:55.340 --> 08:52:00.460
the previous school and the reasons for the problems with that previous school and as she

08:52:00.460 --> 08:52:07.180
pointed out it is a new school it is a startup and they have a shorter record of time in their

08:52:07.180 --> 08:52:13.260
relationship both with their lea and now with the board this school is different this program is

08:52:13.260 --> 08:52:19.820
different this charter management organization is different it has evolved it has changed it has

08:52:19.820 --> 08:52:28.460
gotten savvy and from and i have concerns about what is in the public record i have concerns

08:52:28.460 --> 08:52:32.860
about what is being conflated or what is being changed or what is not being

08:52:34.540 --> 08:52:41.020
sunshineed with with the kind of transparency it should have many of my colleagues on the board

08:52:41.020 --> 08:52:47.500
have heard me often argue and rail about the importance of the public function about the

08:52:47.500 --> 08:52:53.820
implication or the application of the brown act and the need for clear transparent governance

08:52:53.820 --> 08:52:59.180
in these charters and i have objected and voted against charters for that reason many of you have

08:52:59.180 --> 08:53:05.100
heard me argue about how you balance the consideration about the academic performance

08:53:05.100 --> 08:53:11.260
of the school over some of the other equally glaring and concerning problems which are parallel

08:53:11.340 --> 08:53:18.380
and important in my mind and under the law and i have voted against those schools so my colleagues

08:53:18.380 --> 08:53:25.900
on the board have heard me talk with great reason and rationality i hope about what my concerns are

08:53:25.900 --> 08:53:32.860
not just about underperforming charters but charters that are being poorly managed or not

08:53:32.940 --> 08:53:40.700
managed with public interest or having that hint of or specter of scandal and so that has always

08:53:40.700 --> 08:53:46.700
been my concern and that has been my concern throughout my tenure on this board i have not

08:53:46.700 --> 08:53:52.940
been inconsistent in that discussion but there's something further that's being raised today and

08:53:52.940 --> 08:53:59.180
that's the issue of race for a lot of the folks who are having this conversation and having this

08:53:59.180 --> 08:54:05.660
discussion about race this is not a question about whether or not public schools can serve

08:54:05.660 --> 08:54:12.380
african-american children well and it's also not a question about which one of these public schools

08:54:12.380 --> 08:54:19.420
the charter or the public schools in uberwood are serving african-american children better so

08:54:19.420 --> 08:54:25.500
while race is a double-edged sword that often creeps into these conversations and the needs

08:54:25.660 --> 08:54:32.060
urgent concerns of african-american parents and their children is a paramount concern to me

08:54:32.060 --> 08:54:39.500
personally and to this board as we venture into a new frontier to talk about equity i think that

08:54:39.500 --> 08:54:46.380
the issues of equity have been discussed and argued about passionately by both sides of this

08:54:46.380 --> 08:54:53.740
argument by parents who support this charter as well as by parents who did not find their children

08:54:53.740 --> 08:54:59.500
were successful in this charter and those parents were african-american on both sides of this table

08:54:59.500 --> 08:55:03.660
and the same thing is true for parents who are seeking an alternative because of their

08:55:03.660 --> 08:55:10.300
dissatisfaction with the way eaglewood is serving african-american children so as the board continues

08:55:10.300 --> 08:55:16.540
their conversation and the discussion here having issues and discussions of race and having a

08:55:16.540 --> 08:55:23.340
discussion about the is about how race is being served in this conversation does not serve us

08:55:23.340 --> 08:55:29.580
well especially if it becomes politicized and it becomes the hockey puck that's pushed around from

08:55:29.580 --> 08:55:35.260
one side to the other as the rationale of justification for us to deal with either our

08:55:35.260 --> 08:55:41.900
discomfort or our self-righteous assertion that we have the answer we have the definitive answer

08:55:41.900 --> 08:55:46.700
or we know better so that's all i actually want to say thank you eileen for giving me that

08:55:46.700 --> 08:55:51.660
opportunity i appreciate that thank you member wrecker thank you very much for your comments

08:55:52.540 --> 08:55:54.860
let me ask our member novel

08:55:58.380 --> 08:56:00.940
yeah i'll make a couple of comments here

08:56:03.580 --> 08:56:10.940
i'm extremely disappointed how we got here i think at the end of the day because of poor district

08:56:10.940 --> 08:56:18.940
charter relationships kids get hurt and it it comes down to us to try and sort out this mess

08:56:18.940 --> 08:56:26.140
and the truth for me is the petition is confusing it's hard to gain clarity on a multitude of issues

08:56:27.340 --> 08:56:30.860
i don't see the relationship being repaired between the district and the charter

08:56:31.740 --> 08:56:36.140
and i quite honestly don't see my ability to find the truth in the situation

08:56:37.100 --> 08:56:43.740
the revocation of the charter that alleged revocation that today's fresh start would say

08:56:43.740 --> 08:56:49.420
is not a revocation the alleged violations of students with disabilities that i'm sure

08:56:49.660 --> 08:56:57.260
today's fresh start would dispute the county's description on slide 22 of a conflict of interest

08:56:57.980 --> 08:57:05.260
that i'm sure today's fresh start would dispute this is a complex request that doesn't

08:57:06.540 --> 08:57:13.100
promote or allow for complete clarity based on the disputed facts and for me

08:57:13.740 --> 08:57:19.740
it's impossible to overturn cd's recommendation based on all of this that's all i have to say at

08:57:19.740 --> 08:57:31.020
this time so i'll just ask one comment um i'm i'm worried for the kids um this is really challenging

08:57:31.020 --> 08:57:39.820
times um for all kids and to face i mean obviously the school we're in the new school year now

08:57:39.820 --> 08:57:47.420
in the new fiscal year and um i i just would say i i recognize what the parents said about

08:57:48.060 --> 08:57:55.260
wanting a safe place for their kids and worried about starting a new school um and i um i'm

08:57:55.340 --> 08:58:02.060
certainly i hear that they're beginning to look for new options but i think we have a responsibility

08:58:02.860 --> 08:58:07.260
from englwood and los angeles to reach out to the students and to make their transition

08:58:08.540 --> 08:58:14.940
should we not approve it safe and supportive i i worry for the students because i i think that

08:58:14.940 --> 08:58:21.580
families and the students have chose it for a good reason and i in the end they're the ones that lose

08:58:22.140 --> 08:58:26.700
um are there any other comments from board members

08:58:29.580 --> 08:58:37.580
um member sung do we have a motion um well i i did want to follow up on on your your um concerns

08:58:37.580 --> 08:58:45.740
and maybe we could ask uh englwood district you had in the prior asked the district uh you know

08:58:46.700 --> 08:58:53.260
you know how they would take in the students or if you know if we were to deny this

08:58:54.220 --> 08:58:58.700
petition how would the transition work with something like that and are they prepared

08:58:59.500 --> 08:59:05.580
what they're looking at doing oh thank you so much for that question and for your comments um

08:59:06.380 --> 08:59:13.180
we are extremely excited to welcome all families to the englwood unified school district

08:59:13.820 --> 08:59:19.420
um we have 17 schools that we operate we have capacity at each one of our schools

08:59:20.620 --> 08:59:27.820
we have amazing programs we have amazing teachers we have amazing principals and amazing classified

08:59:27.820 --> 08:59:35.180
staff willing and ready to welcome all families to the englwood unified school district what we are

08:59:35.180 --> 08:59:42.700
planning to do is to host a virtual meeting with our today's fresh start family to welcome them

08:59:43.180 --> 08:59:48.220
we're offering two open houses that will be conducted at each one of our schools

08:59:49.180 --> 08:59:55.820
we're planning for one in july and also one in august these open houses will provide our family

08:59:55.820 --> 09:00:01.420
with an opportunity to get to know our amazing principals and teachers and staff so that they

09:00:01.420 --> 09:00:07.100
could also learn about the unique programs that our district offers we're going to provide all

09:00:07.100 --> 09:00:14.220
of our today's fresh start families a welcome packet we are excited to welcome them and to

09:00:14.220 --> 09:00:19.420
invite them to open house activities and we're planning to send that information

09:00:20.060 --> 09:00:27.020
to the today's fresh start community also we will provide opportunities for them to visit

09:00:27.020 --> 09:00:32.540
the schools of their choice because we are an open enrollment district a district of choice

09:00:33.500 --> 09:00:40.860
and so we will work very closely with each family member through our concierge service where we

09:00:40.860 --> 09:00:48.060
will contact each family individually and assign a staff member to work with that family individually

09:00:48.060 --> 09:00:53.260
to welcome them back to the englwood unified school district and to talk to them about the

09:00:53.260 --> 09:00:59.020
programs that we offer to schedule a tour if that's something that our parents are interested in

09:00:59.100 --> 09:01:07.020
doing and we're actually going to assign somebody to be the main point of contact for each family

09:01:07.020 --> 09:01:14.060
member so that they know who to connect with directly in the event that this charter school

09:01:14.860 --> 09:01:23.820
is closed thank you member strouse this is stephanie farland i just wanted to add to that

09:01:24.540 --> 09:01:30.300
because we had mentioned in my presentation earlier that a good proportion of the students

09:01:30.300 --> 09:01:38.060
from englwood would actually attend la unified schools we did reach out to la unified and they

09:01:41.100 --> 09:01:46.700
responded by by saying that they will certainly engage and support all the families and students

09:01:46.700 --> 09:01:52.460

09:01:53.980 --> 09:01:57.900

about concierge service for school children i like that concept um all children should have

09:03:04.540 --> 09:03:11.180
concierge service i would just um associate my thoughts with those that were made by member

navo on given you know the various statements on both sides but also the concerns that were raised

09:03:17.820 --> 09:03:26.620

kids um however i am also in agreement with member navo and president linda darling hammon that

09:04:06.220 --> 09:04:16.220

09:04:16.220 --> 09:04:24.700
throughout the the life of the charter which has been very long that uh i have to go with the

09:04:24.700 --> 09:04:32.300

matter um and then whatever questions you have i will along with pradeep will be happy to answer

09:09:00.860 --> 09:09:05.980
so our recommendation is that the californ is that the californian department of education

09:09:05.980 --> 09:09:12.140
recommends that the state board of education sb ratify california's education stabilization fund

09:09:12.140 --> 09:09:18.300
rethink k-12 education models grant um we call it the esf rem grant for short

09:09:19.100 --> 09:09:25.020
um that we ratify this application to develop a statewide course access program for all grades

09:09:25.020 --> 09:09:35.340
six through 12 students in california as many of you know in response to covet 19 congress

09:09:35.340 --> 09:09:41.980
passed the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act and it was enacted on march

09:09:41.980 --> 09:09:48.060
27 2020 with a 30.75 billion dollars in emergency education funding to states

09:09:49.180 --> 09:09:53.260
of a one percent set aside is where the esf rem grant comes from

09:09:56.380 --> 09:10:00.460
the purpose of this grant is meant to support state educational agencies and states with the

09:10:00.460 --> 09:10:05.340
highest coronavirus burden to address specific educational needs of students their parents

09:10:05.340 --> 09:10:09.660
and teachers in public and non-public elementary schools in accordance with the cares act

09:10:10.620 --> 09:10:15.420
the three absolute priorities for the grant competition are to provide funding through

09:10:15.420 --> 09:10:20.220
micro grants to develop and or expand high quality course access programs or statewide

09:10:20.220 --> 09:10:25.420
virtual school or to demonstrate a rationale to address the specific educational needs

09:10:25.420 --> 09:10:31.500
of their states as related to remote learning and we're required to take on one of these

09:10:31.500 --> 09:10:34.540
absolute priorities in the grant competition for our application

09:10:34.700 --> 09:10:42.460
um these grants are peer reviewed by um peer reviewers with a range of experience in education

09:10:42.460 --> 09:10:48.460
and background uh they would they will independently read score and provide written comments for grant

09:10:48.460 --> 09:10:53.900
applications they're going to be 12 to 14 awards for states with the highest coronavirus burden

09:10:55.020 --> 09:11:00.460
estimated funds of 180 million dollars and the range of awards five million to 20 million for

09:11:00.460 --> 09:11:05.980
the project approval life cycle is up to 36 months as well and the application required a letter

09:11:05.980 --> 09:11:16.460
supporting proposal from the governor the due date for this application was june 29 2020 which

09:11:16.460 --> 09:11:23.180
the cde met we also sent in on may 19 2020 the intent to apply before that which was uh

09:11:23.180 --> 09:11:26.940
strongly encouraged as part of the application process through collaboration with the cde the

09:11:26.940 --> 09:11:32.220
state board of education and the governor's office our application was submitted and the u.s

09:11:32.220 --> 09:11:35.740
department of education plans to make awards by august 2020

09:11:40.780 --> 09:11:46.300
now we'll go into cd's proposal for the grant application and the application

09:11:46.620 --> 09:11:49.420
um

09:11:50.940 --> 09:11:57.260
now we'll go into cd's proposal for the esf rem grant for our proposal cd selected absolute

09:11:57.260 --> 09:12:02.940
priority number two this priority is to develop and or expand high quality course access programs

09:12:07.180 --> 09:12:11.580
the impact coven 19 has had on the california educational environment

09:12:11.580 --> 09:12:16.540
can most be seen through the digital divide when it came to offering courses and programs in an

09:12:16.540 --> 09:12:22.460
online online environment proactively the cd and other partners have undertaken major effort to

09:12:22.460 --> 09:12:28.380
work with public and private partners across the state to increase digital resources the second is

09:12:28.380 --> 09:12:33.420
that coven 19 is amplified concern around the inability to optimize learning acceleration

09:12:33.420 --> 09:12:39.100
and the impact this has had on students from under-resourced populations and third post

09:12:39.100 --> 09:12:44.220
coven 19 educational environment requires that california expand high quality college and career

09:12:44.220 --> 09:12:52.540
ready resources and programs in response to these issues the cd is proposing the california open

09:12:52.540 --> 09:12:58.460
education project or calif hop-ed project for short by building a statewide learning and teaching

09:12:58.460 --> 09:13:04.700
equity platform to increase access to quality college and career distance learning education

09:13:04.780 --> 09:13:10.460
to improve learning outcomes for students grade through students grades six through 12 throughout

09:13:10.460 --> 09:13:17.100
the state the project builds out the college and career ready infrastructure by developing a

09:13:17.100 --> 09:13:21.740
statewide course access platform to increase access to college and career distance learning

09:13:21.740 --> 09:13:27.420
curriculum for students and educators and informs parents about the ways in which cal op ed can

09:13:27.420 --> 09:13:33.420
provide increased educational access for their students this project is especially important

09:13:33.420 --> 09:13:37.740
given students in remote and rural regions that have historically lacked funding

09:13:37.740 --> 09:13:41.340
and or capacity to better access high quality digital coursework

09:13:47.500 --> 09:13:52.140
so the three primary objectives are to provide a common platform to all public and non-public

09:13:52.140 --> 09:13:56.780
schools so teachers and students have access to quality digital learning resources and enhanced

09:13:56.780 --> 09:14:03.020
instructional materials also an objective is to create a statewide stakeholder group consisting

09:14:03.020 --> 09:14:09.100
of parents community leaders industry partners and educational leaders to identify critical needs

09:14:09.100 --> 09:14:16.540
to provide input and third the project will convene regional educator teams to collaboratively

09:14:16.540 --> 09:14:22.220
write curate and develop a repository of courses curriculum and professional learning modules and

09:14:22.220 --> 09:14:28.620
we believe these last two objectives are extremely important due to the fact that we believe the best

09:14:28.700 --> 09:14:32.380
outcomes are had when multiple parties and professionals collaborate to provide the

09:14:32.380 --> 09:14:41.980
best outcome for our state students when coming up with this proposal cd and sbe staff wanted

09:14:41.980 --> 09:14:47.020
to ensure that it was built with a sustainable outlook in mind meaning that the project not just

09:14:47.020 --> 09:14:52.540
be a short-term response to the covid 19 pandemic but must also be focused on building on top of

09:14:52.540 --> 09:14:58.140
long-term foundations in order to guarantee equitable advancement for all students even

09:14:58.140 --> 09:15:03.660
after the pandemic has ended with that in mind this project aims to increase access to an inclusive

09:15:03.660 --> 09:15:09.180
and innovative 21st century education that will prepare students to meet the new demands for

09:15:09.180 --> 09:15:15.580
distance learning and the jobs for tomorrow additionally the cal op ed project provides

09:15:15.580 --> 09:15:20.700
vital offerings to students from underserved and rural regions it also works to build on and

09:15:20.700 --> 09:15:26.380
maximize the current cte online platform which hosts professional learning resources for educators

09:15:26.380 --> 09:15:35.420
around the state in the application that was submitted to the u.s department of education the

09:15:35.420 --> 09:15:40.780
cd provided a detailed description of responsibilities timelines and milestones that the project would

09:15:40.780 --> 09:15:46.140
require in the interest of respecting the board's time i will point members to attachment two and

09:15:46.140 --> 09:15:52.540
the item for the detailed breakdown one highlight for this project the cd is requesting over 19

09:15:52.540 --> 09:15:59.100
million dollars over three years to fund the project also for note in this application it was

09:15:59.100 --> 09:16:04.300
required the state demonstrate its coronavirus burden although the u.s department of education

09:16:04.300 --> 09:16:10.220
assigned california one of the lowest scores for coronavirus burden this score was based on percent

09:16:10.220 --> 09:16:17.020
of population without access to broadband percent of k-12 students in poverty states percentage share

09:16:17.020 --> 09:16:23.580
of covid 19 cases per capita and percent of students who live in a rural area through our

09:16:23.580 --> 09:16:28.700
application we made the case that just looking at percentages alone for scoring does not accurately

09:16:28.700 --> 09:16:35.260
reflect the state's true coronavirus burden maine which received a top score with over 11.7 percent

09:16:35.260 --> 09:16:41.740
of their students without broadband access equates to 21 000 students in raw numbers where california's

09:16:41.820 --> 09:16:49.980
8.9 percent equates to approximately 570 000 students also at the time of the proposal even

09:16:49.980 --> 09:16:54.940
though the cases per capita was lower in california the burden score did not reflect the aggressive

09:16:54.940 --> 09:16:59.340
approach undertaken by governor newsome and our state's leading officials to flatten the curve

09:16:59.340 --> 09:17:04.220
through shelter in place and the closing of schools earlier than in other states which increased the

09:17:04.220 --> 09:17:11.020
time students spent outside the classroom nor did the u.s department of education score consider the

09:17:11.020 --> 09:17:17.340
fluid nature of this pandemic which is evolving each day the application made the point that a

09:17:17.340 --> 09:17:21.340
hugely significant burden has been felt by our state and its citizens

09:17:24.060 --> 09:17:30.380
continually also the proposal required the cde to sign off on multiple insurances that are detailed

09:17:30.380 --> 09:17:36.140
in attachment attachment three of the item this proposal also received a letter of support from

09:17:36.140 --> 09:17:38.780
governor newsome as required by the application

09:17:46.380 --> 09:17:52.620
so in closing we believe that this is to take a proactive approach for the post-covid 19 pandemic

09:17:52.620 --> 09:17:58.700
that it helps our students in both the short and long term as required by the changing educational

09:17:58.700 --> 09:18:04.940
environment to distance learning the cde recommends that the sb e ratify california's

09:18:04.940 --> 09:18:10.940
esf rem grant application to develop a statewide course access program for all grades six through

09:18:10.940 --> 09:18:21.340
12 students in california and with that i will open up for questions thank you very much we're

09:18:21.340 --> 09:18:28.700
going to open a public comment line the phone line for public comment members of the public wishing

09:18:28.700 --> 09:18:33.580
to provide comment on this item may do so by calling seven one two four three two zero zero

09:18:33.580 --> 09:18:41.580
seven five entering access code 651 905 pound wait for the operator prompts to press star six

09:18:42.300 --> 09:18:47.260
and then another prompt to press one to enter the queue while we're waiting to see if members of

09:18:47.260 --> 09:18:55.420
the public are calling in i want to ask patricia rucker first and then ting sun as our cte liaisons

09:18:55.420 --> 09:19:02.380
if they have any initial comments thank you very thank you very much

09:19:03.820 --> 09:19:12.060
this is definitely a need in the state and i'm glad for the prospect of some substantial funding

09:19:12.780 --> 09:19:20.140
to support our overall state plan for developing career and technical education

09:19:21.100 --> 09:19:31.260
in this state now it is worth noting that this project is being led by the cde

09:19:33.820 --> 09:19:39.900
and so dr kodem rajan you already know what my question is going to be

09:19:41.500 --> 09:19:47.740
when the statewide stakeholder group is organized please tell me there will be

09:19:48.700 --> 09:19:53.100
more than one classroom teacher on this statewide stakeholder group

09:19:56.140 --> 09:20:00.700
member rucker i i can assure you that there will be more than one teacher in fact

09:20:01.820 --> 09:20:08.060
the majority of that stakeholder group will be teachers that's what we use in the ct online

09:20:08.060 --> 09:20:12.860
project that we've done we've used uh perconsponse to develop and they're

09:20:13.820 --> 09:20:18.700
the ones who developed the modules for that system are teachers and we will

09:20:18.700 --> 09:20:24.860
pull it we'll be pulling those those individuals in okay fed i know that we will

09:20:25.500 --> 09:20:32.380
go spending some time at tomorrow's meeting talking about this as well so i won't go into

09:20:32.380 --> 09:20:39.820
detail on that point but i just wanted to make sure for the record as we are prepared i'm sorry

09:20:39.820 --> 09:20:45.900
as we are working to approve this that that information is clear i want to also say i

09:20:45.900 --> 09:20:53.340
appreciate the equity lens and i wonder if the majority of historically marginalized students

09:20:53.980 --> 09:21:01.340
in california would benefit from a more expansive consideration of equity in the project design and

09:21:01.340 --> 09:21:06.700
planning and that's something i just want you to make a note about because i know that the

09:21:07.660 --> 09:21:14.060
grant is a living document and we can talk more about the equity issue especially with

09:21:15.180 --> 09:21:20.940
the superintendent's new equity officer as we move down the road to implementing the grant

09:21:21.900 --> 09:21:29.660
and then finally i just want to say it's really important for us to see as you look at all three

09:21:29.660 --> 09:21:35.820
of the attachments in the scoping section of the grant it would seem like it's three projects

09:21:36.460 --> 09:21:43.820
but it's really important for us to articulate to articulate that this is part of the overall

09:21:43.820 --> 09:21:52.460
program and design for the state plan about career and technical education and so even though the

09:21:52.460 --> 09:22:00.140
the community colleges are going to be uppermost in a lot of the planning and the work on scoping

09:22:00.140 --> 09:22:09.260
this out the intent really is to create a clear grade 6 through 12 program so i really appreciate

09:22:09.260 --> 09:22:15.500
the work the department has done and the effort that was done to as a collaborative project

09:22:15.500 --> 09:22:22.540
to prepare this grant and submit it thank you all right ting did you want to add anything

09:22:23.340 --> 09:22:29.260
yeah just uh quickly we of course we're ratifying this because there was a such a short timeline

09:22:29.260 --> 09:22:35.900
and cde really needed to had a short time period to get the application done and submit it it is an

09:22:35.900 --> 09:22:43.980
ambitious project and so in a lot of details will need to be flushed out as member rucker indicated

09:22:43.980 --> 09:22:49.980
so i think there will definitely be much more we'll see the shape of this if we get approved

09:22:49.980 --> 09:22:58.700
one thing i did want to clarify however the item said that we were asking for 19.19 million

09:22:58.700 --> 09:23:07.420
394 and the slide said 19 million 880 something so there was a discrepancy between the item and

09:23:07.420 --> 09:23:12.940
what was on the slide so uh staff can just clarify what that is so we know what we're ratifying

09:23:16.140 --> 09:23:23.340
members it's actually 19.394 is the amount that we're right ratifying

09:23:24.300 --> 09:23:26.780
okay so it is what is in the item yeah

09:23:30.620 --> 09:23:35.740
all right thank you all right moving ahead i want to see if there's any public comment

09:23:36.380 --> 09:23:38.220
we do have one person

09:23:42.060 --> 09:23:49.420
caller you are unmuted would you like to provide comment for item 22 regarding the grant application

09:23:53.900 --> 09:23:55.580
no thank you

09:23:59.260 --> 09:24:07.260
all right that was short and sweet i guess this is for another item perhaps are there any

09:24:09.900 --> 09:24:15.340
other comments from the from the board

09:24:15.580 --> 09:24:23.740

09:25:36.220 --> 09:25:41.900
presenting and for your work on this we appreciate it we're now going to go to waiver request item

09:25:41.900 --> 09:25:47.980
16 the request by fallbrook union elementary school district to waive california education

09:25:48.140 --> 09:25:56.140
california education comes section 5020 and portions of sections 5019, 5021, and 5030

09:25:56.140 --> 09:26:02.780
that require a district-wide election to establish a trustee a by trustee area method of election

09:26:03.900 --> 09:26:10.060
cde recommendation is given in unique circumstances of COVID-19 pandemic the resulting

09:26:10.060 --> 09:26:15.020
budget problems for school districts and the fact that districts are working remotely in the spring

09:26:15.020 --> 09:26:20.140
that the state board make a determination that there is a need to take immediate action on the

09:26:20.140 --> 09:26:26.140
waiver the need for action came to the attention of cde and the state board after the agenda was

09:26:26.140 --> 09:26:32.540
posted on june 26th the state board makes that determination with a two-thirds vote and the cde

09:26:32.540 --> 09:26:39.100
recommends the state board approve the waiver and this item is presented by judy sias and larry

09:26:39.580 --> 09:26:46.460
hi it's judy sias chief counsel with the state board linda thank you for explaining this waiver

09:26:47.260 --> 09:26:54.140
this is one of our typical waivers to approve the at-large election by trustee area method of

09:26:54.140 --> 09:27:00.220
election districts that have an at-large system of electing board members have been facing litigation

09:27:00.220 --> 09:27:05.660
under the california by voting rights act to help avoid litigation districts work with their

09:27:05.740 --> 09:27:11.100
county committee on school district organization to draw area maps and take action to establish

09:27:11.100 --> 09:27:17.660
trustee areas and adopt the trustee area method of election in order to establish the trustee

09:27:17.660 --> 09:27:22.700
area and implement this new method as quickly as possible districts will often request a waiver

09:27:22.700 --> 09:27:28.460
from the state board that the trust the election method be approved at a district-wide election

09:27:29.020 --> 09:27:33.660
if the sbe approves the waiver then there will be an election in the district to elect the governing

09:27:33.660 --> 09:27:39.260
board members under the new system this waiver helps districts avoid litigation by moving to

09:27:39.260 --> 09:27:45.180
the new system quickly the sb has approved over 200 of these waivers so this waiver is not

09:27:45.180 --> 09:27:50.940
controversial this one is a little bit unique because we received a call from the fallbrook

09:27:50.940 --> 09:27:57.580
union elementary district last week on july second after the agenda was posted that they realized

09:27:57.580 --> 09:28:02.860
that their waiver was not on the july agenda the san diego county registrar of voters told the

09:28:02.860 --> 09:28:07.660
district that if they did not put the get a waiver approved in july they would have to have an

09:28:07.660 --> 09:28:12.860
election on the election method and that would cost them over three hundred thousand dollars

09:28:13.660 --> 09:28:20.060
so i would like to thank larry shirey who quickly worked with work to develop this item so that we

09:28:20.060 --> 09:28:26.780
could add it to the agenda we feel like as linda stated at the beginning given the unique circumstances

09:28:26.780 --> 09:28:32.220
with covid and the fact that districts were working remotely and the budget crisis you know

09:28:32.220 --> 09:28:38.460
we would like to accommodate the district if we could so under since this came to our attention

09:28:38.460 --> 09:28:45.100
after the 10-day posting under bagley keen we need two votes so the first vote would be for you all

09:28:45.100 --> 09:28:51.180
to add this item to the agenda so you have to make the determination that there is a need to

09:28:51.180 --> 09:28:57.820
take immediate action and that the need for action came to our attention after the agenda was posted

09:28:57.820 --> 09:29:02.940
like linda said that's two-thirds vote once you make that vote to add it to the agenda

09:29:02.940 --> 09:29:10.460
then we will need a quick vote to approve the waiver that that is it thank you very much

09:29:10.460 --> 09:29:15.020
and i think we will open the phone line for public comment if there is any

09:29:16.060 --> 09:29:23.500
and it's the same notification that we had before and i suspect our last caller was calling for this

09:29:23.500 --> 09:29:30.140
item so um do you want to well oh i wanted to ask patricia rucker i'm sorry she's our

09:29:30.140 --> 09:29:37.100
waiver liaison if she has any initial comments before we turn to well and i do understand

09:29:38.140 --> 09:29:45.020
that we have two votes that we need to take so when we are ready to make those votes i will make

09:29:45.020 --> 09:29:51.740
the motions related to both of those votes and for our new board members i do want to explain

09:29:52.380 --> 09:30:02.060
one other point that's important about this particular item only the election to establish

09:30:02.060 --> 09:30:11.740
the trustee area and the election method will be eliminated by approving this waiver voters in the

09:30:11.740 --> 09:30:19.740
district will continue elect to all governing board members and moreover the waiver will not

09:30:19.740 --> 09:30:28.860
eliminate any existing legal rights for currently seated board members thank you patricia

09:30:31.980 --> 09:30:34.140
okay uh is there any public comment

09:30:37.180 --> 09:30:43.020

i move that the state board of education make a determination that there is a need

09:31:33.900 --> 09:31:39.820
to take immediate action on this waiver and that the need for action came to the attention

09:31:40.460 --> 09:31:49.020
