WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.700
I hereby call the March 2023 meeting of the State Board of Education to order at one o'clock

00:09.700 --> 00:10.700
p.m.

00:10.700 --> 00:13.360
That's very loud.

00:13.360 --> 00:15.660
And I'd like us to start by saluting the flag.

00:15.660 --> 00:17.660
Senator Rodriguez, will you please lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance?

00:17.660 --> 00:18.660
Absolutely.

00:18.660 --> 00:19.660
Please stand.

00:19.660 --> 00:20.660
Place your hand on your plate.

00:20.660 --> 00:21.660
Then you begin.

00:21.660 --> 00:22.660
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for

00:22.660 --> 00:23.660
which it stands.

00:23.660 --> 00:36.660
The United States of America, commonly known as the United States of America, is a country

00:36.660 --> 00:41.660
primarily located in the United States of America.

00:41.660 --> 00:44.660
We had Siri doing the pledge with us.

00:44.660 --> 00:57.660
So this is good because part of the idea for today was that we were going to be very informal

00:57.660 --> 01:00.660
and have this informal retreat.

01:00.660 --> 01:04.660
That was before we talked to the lawyers and figured out that we needed to be able to broadcast

01:04.660 --> 01:05.660
and organize.

01:05.660 --> 01:10.660
And I want to thank all the staff who took this idea and made it come true.

01:10.660 --> 01:14.660
But I do want you to try to feel as informal as you can.

01:14.660 --> 01:18.660
And maybe we'll have Siri interrupt us again.

01:18.660 --> 01:22.660
Item one is the study session on assessment innovation.

01:22.660 --> 01:28.660
And our goal is to really look at assessment that can support teaching and learning and

01:28.660 --> 01:34.660
think about together how we can imagine our system so that it does that.

01:34.660 --> 01:41.660
And I have a couple of remarks, which I literally put on the back of a napkin, that I want to

01:41.660 --> 01:44.660
just kind of help us get our heads wrapped around this.

01:44.660 --> 01:50.660
We are coming out of a pandemic and we have an opportunity, we have an obligation to figure

01:50.660 --> 01:55.660
out how to help accelerate learning for all of our students and to heighten equity for

01:55.660 --> 01:59.660
all of them, especially those who have been furthest from opportunity.

01:59.660 --> 02:03.660
There's a nationwide conversation going on about that.

02:03.660 --> 02:09.660
And more than 20 states now are rethinking their teaching, learning and assessment systems

02:09.660 --> 02:16.660
to try to create an integrated approach that provides information about the learning process

02:16.660 --> 02:20.660
that can feed into supports for students.

02:20.660 --> 02:26.660
Many of them are looking at how to deepen the opportunities for performance assessment

02:26.660 --> 02:32.660
where students get to show what they know in ways that are more than selecting an answer

02:32.660 --> 02:38.660
from a set of predetermined answers.

02:38.660 --> 02:44.660
The college board has also announced just recently that they're going to be putting

02:44.660 --> 02:47.660
performance assessments into each of their courses.

02:47.660 --> 02:52.660
So some of you may know that they started, of course, the art course and the language courses

02:52.660 --> 02:55.660
have had such assessments for a long time.

02:55.660 --> 03:00.660
They recently put together a research and inquiry series of courses where students are

03:00.660 --> 03:09.660
engaged in inquiry and projects and those are designed and scored both by other AP teachers

03:09.660 --> 03:11.660
and sometimes by their teacher.

03:11.660 --> 03:18.660
And then they put in place a performance task in the computer science AP course which requires

03:18.660 --> 03:24.660
that students design a program and collaboratively and test it out and then individually

03:24.660 --> 03:26.660
describe and explain what they've done.

03:26.660 --> 03:32.660
And what they found is that in the course of doing this, they're not only getting a broader

03:32.660 --> 03:36.660
and more diverse group of students into the courses, they're succeeding at higher rates,

03:36.660 --> 03:43.660
equity is increasing and the studies show that the students who have that experience

03:43.660 --> 03:45.660
do better in college.

03:45.660 --> 03:52.660
So some folks have had this experience in various ways but this is the nature of the conversation

03:52.660 --> 03:58.660
that is going on and teachers, when that happens, have ways to see what their students are

03:58.660 --> 04:03.660
thinking and what they're learning along the way before the end of the year.

04:03.660 --> 04:06.660
This is very much like what a lot of other countries do.

04:06.660 --> 04:12.660
If you were in the UK or Australia or Singapore or New Zealand, that kind of element of performance

04:12.660 --> 04:18.660
would be part of the examination system and would be not just at the end of the year but

04:18.660 --> 04:22.660
would be part of the process of teaching and learning.

04:22.660 --> 04:27.660
So the conversation has been about assessment of as and for learning.

04:27.660 --> 04:34.660
The US has more of a tradition of assessment of learning but when assessment is for learning,

04:34.660 --> 04:42.660
it provides deeper information than a score alone and it also can emulate what good learning

04:42.660 --> 04:45.660
and teaching looks like.

04:45.660 --> 04:52.660
The US Department of Education is re-regulating the Innovative Authority for Innovative Assessment

04:52.660 --> 04:59.660
Demonstration Authority this spring to enable more states to be able to take up innovations

04:59.660 --> 05:06.660
and assessment because of the drumbeat that came about during the pandemic for more opportunity.

05:06.660 --> 05:12.660
And they have also begun to redesign the guidance that they give to states.

05:12.660 --> 05:14.660
So there's a lot happening.

05:14.660 --> 05:19.660
We are fortunate to already be using one of the more innovative assessments in the country

05:19.660 --> 05:24.660
through Smarter Balanced, through the consortium of states that develop Smarter Balanced.

05:24.660 --> 05:27.660
It includes some performance tasks.

05:27.660 --> 05:32.660
It was because of the design of the rules at the time, sort of at the end of the year,

05:32.660 --> 05:38.660
but you've heard from Tony Alpert, the director of Smarter Balanced, in our last meeting about

05:38.660 --> 05:43.660
pilots to potentially locate performance assessments during the year.

05:43.660 --> 05:50.660
We're also fortunate that ETS is our contractor for that and also has a contract with us for

05:50.660 --> 05:57.660
science assessments in which they have promised to work with us to develop performance elements

05:57.660 --> 05:59.660
of the science assessment.

05:59.660 --> 06:04.660
So we have a lot on our plate to think about.

06:04.660 --> 06:10.660
We're also very fortunate to have Mao Vang hitting our assessment division who is really

06:10.660 --> 06:15.660
open-minded about all the possibilities that we may be exploring.

06:15.660 --> 06:26.660
The reason we're starting with this kind of informal retreat, pretend it is, is because

06:26.660 --> 06:29.660
this kind of work is not cut and dried, right?

06:29.660 --> 06:36.660
This is we need to think together about our options, our students, our goals for an integrated

06:36.660 --> 06:41.660
system of teaching, learning, and assessment, one that does provide useful information for

06:41.660 --> 06:46.660
guiding practice and supporting students, that does measure higher order thinking skills

06:46.660 --> 06:52.660
and performance skills, that is culturally and linguistically responsive, and today just

06:52.660 --> 06:56.660
gives us an opportunity to begin to think and talk together without having to vote,

06:56.660 --> 07:01.660
without having to come to decisions, but really learning.

07:01.660 --> 07:06.660
We're going to hear from some experts around the country, and we're fortunate to have

07:06.660 --> 07:08.660
one here in California.

07:08.660 --> 07:13.660
Deb Sigman is going to both teach us some things and help moderate the session.

07:13.660 --> 07:22.660
So I'm excited about the day, and Gabriella is going to also share with us as our assessment

07:22.660 --> 07:28.660
liaison some of the ways that she thinks about this from her work in the classroom.

07:29.660 --> 07:31.660
Okay, thanks Linda.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.660
I'm equally excited to have this conversation.

07:33.660 --> 07:39.660
As a classroom teacher, I always think, do we know what assessments look like at the

07:39.660 --> 07:40.660
state level?

07:40.660 --> 07:43.660
Do our members interact with assessments often?

07:43.660 --> 07:48.660
And so today I want you to think of every student, regardless of their background and

07:48.660 --> 07:54.660
what they look like or where they live, deserve access to an excellent education that empowers

07:54.660 --> 07:56.660
them to achieve their dreams.

07:56.660 --> 08:02.660
We must employ quality assessment practices that generate accurate, useful evidence of

08:02.660 --> 08:05.660
student learning to support instruction and student success.

08:05.660 --> 08:12.660
We want to rethink assessments as a means, not an end, a means to expand equity and close

08:12.660 --> 08:18.660
opportunity gaps to inspire student, educator, and parent caregiver engagement, and to

08:18.660 --> 08:21.660
promote a more holistic view of student learning.

08:21.660 --> 08:24.660
Let's design assessments that inspire learning.

08:24.660 --> 08:29.660
We want to access, assess what is meaningful to student well-being, learning, and

08:29.660 --> 08:30.660
individuality.

08:30.660 --> 08:36.660
Any assessment that we administer should offer a more continuous, equitable measure of

08:36.660 --> 08:41.660
student achievement rather than a single snapshot that reduces student learning to a

08:41.660 --> 08:42.660
single score.

08:42.660 --> 08:47.660
As we embark on today's learning, I would like for us to see assessments as meaningful

08:47.660 --> 08:51.660
and relevant opportunities for students to demonstrate what they've learned and enable

08:51.660 --> 08:56.660
educators to tailor and adjust instructional supports to help our students thrive.

08:56.660 --> 09:02.660
I want us to think about how we can best support our educators in the classroom to really

09:02.660 --> 09:06.660
support that student that we have currently now in our class.

09:06.660 --> 09:11.660
I know that all the teachers who are listening, who are thinking, these assessments are

09:11.660 --> 09:17.660
really just a guide of how our students are doing, and continuously teachers are curating

09:17.660 --> 09:22.660
assessments and planning, collaborating to help our students thrive in the class.

09:22.660 --> 09:28.660
And this assessment is just a snapshot of where our students are and what supports we

09:28.660 --> 09:34.660
can put in place to help them continue as they progress in every grade level.

09:34.660 --> 09:35.660
All right.

09:35.660 --> 09:41.660
Well, we are launching now, and I want to introduce my good friend and our colleague

09:41.660 --> 09:49.660
Deb Sigman, who is currently the senior advisor at WestEd, but was at one time our state

09:49.660 --> 09:50.660
assessment director.

09:50.660 --> 09:56.660
So she's been thinking about these issues for a long time, and she will moderate our

09:56.660 --> 10:00.660
first activity.

10:00.660 --> 10:02.660
Thank you.

10:02.660 --> 10:04.660
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond.

10:04.660 --> 10:08.660
And it's so great to be here.

10:08.660 --> 10:12.660
As your chair said, I've been in this business a long time.

10:12.660 --> 10:18.660
Probably my current title is senior advisor, and I'd have to say emphasis on senior.

10:18.660 --> 10:24.660
But I have been around for a long time, and my whole career has been pretty much dedicated

10:24.660 --> 10:25.660
to assessment.

10:25.660 --> 10:34.660
And so like your chair and co-chair, I feel very passionate about this and your assessment

10:34.660 --> 10:36.660
liaison as well.

10:36.660 --> 10:41.660
It's a really important aspect of our educational system.

10:41.660 --> 10:47.660
I've always looked at assessment as an advocate for children who may or may not be able to

10:47.660 --> 10:49.660
advocate for themselves.

10:49.660 --> 10:51.660
And I firmly believe that.

10:51.660 --> 10:58.660
So having quality assessments that do exactly what Linda was saying is so critically important

10:58.660 --> 11:02.660
as we think about equitable education systems.

11:02.660 --> 11:09.660
But today is your day, your day to think and talk, your day to really start noodling, if

11:09.660 --> 11:14.660
you will, about what a great assessment system in California would look like.

11:14.660 --> 11:21.660
You are the policymakers, so you have a lot of decisions to make.

11:21.660 --> 11:24.660
So we're going to get started.

11:24.660 --> 11:30.660
You'll note that you are at these tables, and these are your study groups, if you will.

11:30.660 --> 11:40.660
And today's first talk is you'll see the questions posted on the easels up there.

11:40.660 --> 11:47.660
So we want you to think about what do you appreciate about our current state assessment

11:47.660 --> 11:52.660
system, our subject matter assessments, so our English language arts and our math, which

11:52.660 --> 11:58.660
are the Smarter Balanced Assessment, as well as your developed CAS, your science assessment,

11:58.660 --> 12:01.660
as well.

12:01.660 --> 12:05.660
So think about what is it that you like about it?

12:05.660 --> 12:08.660
What kind of information do you like about it?

12:08.660 --> 12:11.660
What is it doing well, right?

12:11.660 --> 12:20.660
And then your second question is in what ways do you see that the state assessments support

12:20.660 --> 12:23.660
teaching and learning?

12:23.660 --> 12:27.660
Because at the end of the day, that is what they are supposed to do, support teaching

12:27.660 --> 12:29.660
and learning.

12:29.660 --> 12:33.660
So what ways do you see them supporting teaching and learning?

12:33.660 --> 12:35.660
So we're going to get started right away.

12:35.660 --> 12:42.660
I want you to take a few moments, think about this, talk to your table partners, and you

12:42.660 --> 12:45.660
have post-its at your table.

12:45.660 --> 12:50.660
We want you to start writing these things, and then when you've thought about this and

12:50.660 --> 12:53.660
you want to go post, we'd like you to go post to the easels.

12:53.660 --> 12:56.660
You have two easels, they both have the same questions.

12:56.660 --> 13:03.660
But take a few moments, five minutes maybe, Linda, for discussion a little bit, or discussion

13:03.660 --> 13:05.660
at your table.

13:05.660 --> 13:10.660
You could think about this as sort of appreciations on the one hand and aspirations on the other.

13:10.660 --> 13:18.660
What would we like to see in an ideal world of a teaching, learning, and assessment system?

13:18.660 --> 13:23.660
And it looks like both questions are on both tag boards.

13:23.660 --> 13:28.660
So you can just go to whichever is closer to you and put your appreciations and your

13:28.660 --> 13:29.660
aspirations.

13:29.660 --> 13:30.660
Yes.

13:30.660 --> 13:31.660
All right.

13:31.660 --> 13:32.660
And you're allowed to talk to each other.

13:32.660 --> 13:33.660
Yes.

13:33.660 --> 13:35.660
I want to hear a lot of noise.

14:04.660 --> 14:05.660
Thank you.

14:05.660 --> 14:06.660
Thank you.

14:06.660 --> 14:07.660
Thank you.

14:07.660 --> 14:08.660
Thank you.

14:08.660 --> 14:09.660
Thank you.

14:09.660 --> 14:10.660
Thank you.

14:10.660 --> 14:11.660
Thank you.

14:11.660 --> 14:13.660
Thank you.

14:33.660 --> 14:34.660
Thank you.

15:03.660 --> 15:04.660
Thank you.

15:33.660 --> 15:34.660
Thank you.

16:03.660 --> 16:05.660
Thank you.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.660
Thank you.

17:03.660 --> 17:04.660
Thank you.

17:33.660 --> 17:35.660
Thank you.

18:03.660 --> 18:05.660
Thank you.

18:33.660 --> 18:34.660
Thank you.

19:03.660 --> 19:04.660
Thank you.

19:33.660 --> 19:34.660
Thank you.

20:03.660 --> 20:04.660
Thank you.

20:33.660 --> 20:34.660
Thank you.

21:03.660 --> 21:04.660
Thank you.

21:33.660 --> 21:34.660
Thank you.

22:03.660 --> 22:04.660
Thank you.

22:33.660 --> 22:34.660
Thank you.

23:03.660 --> 23:04.660
Thank you.

23:33.660 --> 23:34.660
Thank you.

24:03.660 --> 24:04.660
Thank you.

24:33.660 --> 24:34.660
Thank you.

25:03.660 --> 25:04.660
Thank you.

25:33.660 --> 25:34.660
Thank you.

26:03.660 --> 26:04.660
Thank you.

26:33.660 --> 26:34.660
Thank you.

27:03.660 --> 27:04.660
Thank you.

27:33.660 --> 27:34.660
Thank you.

28:03.660 --> 28:04.660
Thank you.

28:33.660 --> 28:34.660
Thank you.

29:03.660 --> 29:04.660
Thank you.

29:33.660 --> 29:34.660
Thank you.

30:03.660 --> 30:04.660
Thank you.

30:33.660 --> 30:34.660
Thank you.

31:03.660 --> 31:21.340
And I'm going to go over to the boards and just try to synthesize what I see.

31:21.340 --> 31:25.980
I'll start with the what do you appreciate about our current state assessment system.

31:25.980 --> 31:31.780
Pretty similar on the two boards.

31:31.780 --> 31:36.740
We'll talk about the use of technology with the with the assessments.

31:36.740 --> 31:46.340
A big improvement over our paper pencil tests really create a lot of accessibility opportunities.

31:46.340 --> 31:53.460
Folks like the interim assessments and that I think is over on the other board as well.

31:53.460 --> 31:59.900
Opportunity for students to respond to constructed and selected response.

32:00.820 --> 32:01.820
Really quickly.

32:03.380 --> 32:04.380
Let's see.

32:05.220 --> 32:10.820
Show us what they know much broader than for those of you who remember our CST system back

32:10.820 --> 32:11.820
in the day.

32:12.900 --> 32:14.100
So those are some things.

32:14.100 --> 32:15.220
Let me move over here.

32:20.500 --> 32:24.860
Common high expectations, so common for state policy and family.

32:24.860 --> 32:28.900
So there's recognition that there's some transparency with our state assessment system.

32:30.300 --> 32:39.260
Again, interim assessments appreciate the shorter format, appreciate the fact that California

32:39.260 --> 32:43.900
sees assessments as only one measure when we're talking about the quality of schools

32:43.900 --> 32:46.220
and so forth.

32:46.220 --> 32:48.740
And let's see, again, interim.

32:48.740 --> 32:50.660
So this issue of the system, right?

32:50.660 --> 32:56.380
So the interim assessments being available and so forth seems to be a real highlight.

32:56.380 --> 32:59.860
And then of course performance assessments provide various opportunities.

32:59.860 --> 33:06.860
So that for the first time in our system, we brought in the performance assessment task,

33:06.860 --> 33:08.580
which was pretty remarkable.

33:08.580 --> 33:11.100
I had not had that before.

33:11.100 --> 33:12.460
Okay.

33:12.460 --> 33:13.860
So what are your aspirations?

33:13.860 --> 33:19.580
What would you like to see our assessment do in order to support teaching and learning?

33:19.580 --> 33:22.140
So I love this.

33:22.140 --> 33:29.700
Integrate lesson design with formative assessments, sorry, and have these assessments build upon

33:29.700 --> 33:36.020
the evolution of student, thank you very much.

33:36.020 --> 33:45.220
Ensure there's interdisciplinary data, let's see, claim-level data, but keeping within

33:45.220 --> 33:50.500
short time frame, right, short form time, right?

33:50.500 --> 33:53.860
Develop teaching protocols to examine state assessments.

33:53.860 --> 33:54.860
Interesting.

33:55.220 --> 34:00.100
So a professional development, professional learning kind of aspect.

34:00.100 --> 34:04.140
Voice recognition, I think that was over there as well.

34:04.140 --> 34:05.140
Let's see.

34:05.140 --> 34:07.780
All students have classrooms that are using interims.

34:07.780 --> 34:12.980
Remember there's no legal requirement that we use them, they're an option.

34:12.980 --> 34:18.140
And assessments can be more than a task, rather a process that gives students an opportunity

34:18.140 --> 34:20.440
to demonstrate what they know.

34:20.440 --> 34:24.460
The four C's, communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and creativity.

34:24.460 --> 34:29.940
That's where you'd like to go, let's go over here.

34:29.940 --> 34:35.940
Anchored in curriculum and available during the year, so kind of mimicking what they're

34:35.940 --> 34:42.300
taught during the year, so it's not just a surprise at the end of the year.

34:42.300 --> 34:44.620
Information beyond scores, right?

34:44.620 --> 34:49.620
So we've added a little bit of that, but there's more we can probably do.

34:49.620 --> 34:57.180
More open-ended inquiry that challenges students to use their minds more fully, okay.

34:57.180 --> 35:00.940
Assessments that guide instruction and encourage and support high quality socially culturally

35:00.940 --> 35:06.240
responsive teaching want to see tests that enable students to bring their own knowledge

35:06.240 --> 35:09.740
and backgrounds, so being really culturally responsive.

35:09.740 --> 35:12.980
Let's see, what did I miss?

35:12.980 --> 35:18.540
Oh, projects and research that engage students and use multiple forms of representation.

35:18.540 --> 35:24.340
So I think you have a clear idea of what you'd like to see.

35:24.340 --> 35:30.300
I'd like to ask for any kind of, anybody want to add something?

35:30.300 --> 35:32.020
Anybody have a question?

35:32.020 --> 35:33.820
Anybody want to say something?

35:33.820 --> 35:34.820
Yes.

35:34.820 --> 35:35.820
Oh.

35:35.820 --> 35:45.700
I forgot to put up one, which is figuring out the right assessment on the TK to three

35:45.700 --> 35:48.500
side of the house.

35:48.500 --> 35:57.300
So expanding the system for that TK to three, what would you hope that would do?

35:57.300 --> 36:05.100
I would hope that it would be developmentally appropriate, that would both help both teachers

36:05.100 --> 36:11.100
as well as families figure out how to work together on the early foundations, that would

36:11.100 --> 36:15.540
incorporate many of the things described around the use of interim assessments so that it

36:16.540 --> 36:23.100
time within the school year, and that it could be shared and aggravated at the state level

36:23.100 --> 36:27.140
for the policymakers as well as families.

36:27.140 --> 36:29.100
Great.

36:29.100 --> 36:30.100
Anyone else?

36:30.100 --> 36:31.100
Yes.

36:31.100 --> 36:39.860
I was just thinking about the other end of the spectrum, which is at high school, and

36:39.860 --> 36:48.340
how the summative assessments are only in 11th grade, and how while I wouldn't want

36:48.340 --> 36:58.220
to necessarily advocate for more testing, I think helping teachers in the ninth, tenth,

36:58.220 --> 37:06.860
and tenth grades better understand what's going to be on the test or understand how

37:06.860 --> 37:09.660
to prepare students, just more integration at the high school level.

37:09.660 --> 37:20.220
I think could be really useful, so it doesn't feel like it's just a one of out of the blue.

37:20.220 --> 37:23.420
Teachers can use those interims at ninth and tenth, which many do.

37:23.420 --> 37:24.420
They can.

37:24.420 --> 37:25.420
Yes, you are correct.

37:25.420 --> 37:26.420
Not required.

37:27.180 --> 37:30.180
And then, member Escobedo, did I see your hand raised?

37:48.180 --> 37:50.180
Embedded in the day.

37:50.180 --> 37:52.180
Great point.

37:52.940 --> 37:58.940
I was just thinking about what Sharon was saying.

37:58.940 --> 38:04.100
I've been impressed in some of the states that are creating banks of performance tasks

38:04.100 --> 38:09.780
that those become then rich opportunities for students in any grade level, not just

38:09.780 --> 38:16.980
a tested grade, to experience inquiry learning and for teachers to then have rubrics and

38:17.780 --> 38:24.780
evaluated that inform them about what the standards are trying to achieve and what students

38:24.780 --> 38:26.780
are able to show.

38:26.780 --> 38:30.780
My other thing I forgot to put up there was teachers involved in scoring open in their

38:30.780 --> 38:36.780
tasks, because when you see the actual work that students do, you see their thinking.

38:36.780 --> 38:42.780
You then know much more about how to teach them than if you know that they're a 92

38:43.580 --> 38:45.580
or that they scored below basic.

38:45.580 --> 38:49.580
That just doesn't give you enough knowledge.

38:49.580 --> 38:53.580
So, figuring out how to actually see the work is important, too.

39:03.580 --> 39:08.580
The chart behind me references opportunities for teachers to learn about assessments.

39:09.380 --> 39:15.380
I think families need the same opportunities to really deeply understand the assessments,

39:15.380 --> 39:19.380
the alignment of what that means for their child's learning, and what that means for

39:19.380 --> 39:23.380
their future opportunities as they grow.

39:27.380 --> 39:33.380
I would add, definitely in agreement with all that's been shared, one thing in the aspirational

39:34.180 --> 39:40.980
column that I want to be sure that continues is the opportunity to be able to look at school

39:40.980 --> 39:47.380
to school, district to district, for that comparability, finding out bright spots, finding

39:47.380 --> 39:53.380
out LEAs that may need additional support to best meet the needs of their students.

39:53.380 --> 40:00.380
So I wouldn't want to lose that as we go deeper into the richness that we know needs to happen

40:00.380 --> 40:02.380
in our assessment system.

40:02.380 --> 40:04.380
Keep what's working, right?

40:06.380 --> 40:12.380
I just want to add a little bit to what Allison was saying about involving caregivers, parents.

40:12.380 --> 40:16.380
Some of the workshops that we've had in the past have been involving them also in the

40:16.380 --> 40:22.380
scoring and informing families about the rubrics that we utilize as teachers and having them

40:22.380 --> 40:26.380
also go through the process because when they understand what we are looking for when we

40:26.380 --> 40:30.380
score students, then they also know how they can best support their child at home.

40:32.380 --> 40:34.380
Well put, yes, absolutely.

40:35.380 --> 40:37.380
Any others?

40:39.380 --> 40:46.380
Just briefly, I think also a reset on how we view assessments because oftentimes the

40:46.380 --> 40:54.380
context in which we look at data can reaffirm historic inequities in people's perception

40:54.380 --> 40:56.380
about different student groups.

40:56.380 --> 41:01.380
So thinking about assessments also in ways that show students' assets and the wealth

41:01.380 --> 41:07.380
that comes from different communities as opposed to consistently looking at certain

41:07.380 --> 41:12.380
assessments from a certain mindset or disposition, if that makes sense.

41:12.380 --> 41:15.380
Asset-based as opposed to looking at the deficits.

41:15.380 --> 41:17.380
What strains students bring?

41:19.380 --> 41:21.380
Yes, member Lewis.

41:23.380 --> 41:29.380
I just want to comment on one of the post-its over there about UDL.

41:30.380 --> 41:38.380
And I think incorporating just the principles of UDL to give students, to incorporate representation

41:38.380 --> 41:43.380
of how they show what they know and how the work is presented to them and just incorporate

41:43.380 --> 41:48.380
that in the preparation and also the follow-up to students' assessment and how they do on

41:48.380 --> 41:49.380
the test.

41:49.380 --> 41:53.380
So I think just somehow making that part of the protocol of our assessment is to look

41:53.380 --> 41:55.380
at those principles of UDL.

41:56.380 --> 41:57.380
Incredibly important.

41:59.380 --> 42:00.380
All right.

42:00.380 --> 42:01.380
Oh, absolutely.

42:01.380 --> 42:02.380
Yes.

42:04.380 --> 42:12.380
Not quite sure how to put this, but I'm thinking about in schools where perhaps, I was going

42:12.380 --> 42:16.380
back to my comment about high schools and where in schools where maybe they're not using

42:16.380 --> 42:18.380
the interim assessments.

42:18.380 --> 42:33.380
I think working to ensure that when we're building our assessments, they feel really

42:33.380 --> 42:40.380
of value to teachers so that, and they feel included in that so that they might be likely

42:40.380 --> 42:47.380
to do things that are optional, whether that's use the interim assessments, get involved

42:47.380 --> 42:55.380
in the way that you are, for example, Gabriella, but look to the banks of possible performance

42:55.380 --> 43:06.380
tasks because I think teachers have a really high, like, they want what they do, they know

43:06.380 --> 43:11.380
that their time is valuable in their classroom and they don't want to give it up, right,

43:11.380 --> 43:15.380
for something that feels like it's solely about accountability and not really about

43:15.380 --> 43:16.380
student learning.

43:16.380 --> 43:24.380
And so really helping ensure that we're making that connection or we're prioritizing them.

43:25.380 --> 43:29.380
Making the connection between assessment and teaching and learning.

43:29.380 --> 43:30.380
Critically important.

43:30.380 --> 43:31.380
Yeah.

43:31.380 --> 43:32.380
Member McClellan, did you?

43:32.380 --> 43:33.380
Oh, no.

43:33.380 --> 43:34.380
Okay.

43:34.380 --> 43:35.380
Anyone else?

43:35.380 --> 43:36.380
Yes.

43:36.380 --> 43:37.380
Member Rodriguez.

43:40.380 --> 43:41.380
Yeah.

43:41.380 --> 43:43.380
Great information.

43:43.380 --> 43:48.380
I've really enjoyed everybody's contributions and I concur.

43:48.380 --> 43:56.380
And also I wanted to add a little bit more to, I mentioned the teacher protocols.

43:56.380 --> 44:02.380
So, like, I'm going through my national board maintenance of certification, right, and because,

44:02.380 --> 44:10.380
you know, national board is performance-based, so I have protocols to reflect on my teaching,

44:10.380 --> 44:11.380
which are very valuable.

44:11.380 --> 44:18.380
And so I think about the experience that I've had with performance assessment, right,

44:18.380 --> 44:24.380
whether it was at East Palo Alto High School, planning them for our students.

44:24.380 --> 44:30.380
So it's just something that's embedded in my teaching, even though I didn't go through

44:30.380 --> 44:35.380
edTPAs, for example, right, which I think, like, a lot of our new teachers that are coming in

44:36.380 --> 44:41.380
through those assessment processes have that as part of their mindset.

44:41.380 --> 44:52.380
So, you know, I imagine having protocols for teachers that we can analyze the data without

44:52.380 --> 44:57.380
putting students in boxes, right, and saying, oh, these are low, low, you know, without

44:57.380 --> 45:02.380
doing that, but just saying, okay, this is where they are, you know, and protocols that

45:02.380 --> 45:07.380
are asset-based that we can see, like, this is what they know, how can we get them to

45:07.380 --> 45:15.380
this level, and especially to make it look like it's not final, because I think a lot

45:15.380 --> 45:21.380
of that mindset is still prevalent in our schools because of No Child Left Behind, this

45:21.380 --> 45:26.380
finality to the assessment, but that it is an iterative process, that learning is iterative.

45:26.380 --> 45:34.380
So, you know, I imagine that that would be, like, a wonderful way to have professional

45:34.380 --> 45:40.380
learning that where, you know, we create performance assessments for students in our

45:40.380 --> 45:46.380
subject area, right, you know, whether it's, like, world history or math, and another

45:46.380 --> 45:55.380
thing, being able to see the gaps in thinking, like, maybe I didn't teach this the way I

45:55.380 --> 46:01.380
wanted to because I've noticed a few of my students tend to, they miss this or the analysis

46:01.380 --> 46:08.380
isn't as complete as I'd like it, right, how can I go back and fill in that gap, so.

46:08.380 --> 46:16.380
That examination of student work is so great, as President Darlingham said, as well as kind

46:16.380 --> 46:21.380
of giving the, making it really transparent about what those expectations are and so forth,

46:21.380 --> 46:22.380
yeah.

46:22.380 --> 46:27.380
And it was the analysis of my student work when I went through the national board process

46:27.380 --> 46:31.380
the first time that was the most valuable learning for me as a teacher.

46:33.380 --> 46:35.380
Well, that's wonderful.

46:35.380 --> 46:36.380
Thank you all.

46:36.380 --> 46:38.380
I think we're moving on.

46:38.380 --> 46:39.380
Yes.

46:39.380 --> 46:40.380
All right.

46:40.380 --> 46:41.380
Thank you so much.

46:44.380 --> 46:49.380
We have some experts coming on and I think maybe they're coming on this big screen.

46:49.380 --> 46:50.380
I don't know.

46:52.380 --> 47:06.380
I know the first person who's going to be with us technologically, zooming in, is Lillian

47:06.380 --> 47:07.380
Pace.

47:07.380 --> 47:09.380
Is she coming on here?

47:09.380 --> 47:10.380
Okay.

47:10.380 --> 47:17.380
So I'll just say that she is the Vice President of Policy and Advocacy for Knowledge Works,

47:17.380 --> 47:24.380
and she was involved with the presentation, with the publication that you read as part

47:24.380 --> 47:26.380
of your background reading, and there she is.

47:26.380 --> 47:28.380
Lillian, can you see us?

47:28.380 --> 47:30.380
I don't know what you're seeing on your end.

47:35.380 --> 47:36.380
We can see you.

47:36.380 --> 47:38.380
I don't know yet if we can hear you.

47:38.380 --> 47:39.380
You want to say something?

47:39.380 --> 47:40.380
Okay.

47:40.380 --> 47:41.380
There we go.

47:41.380 --> 47:43.380
I am here.

47:43.380 --> 47:45.380
Just give me one second.

47:45.380 --> 47:51.380
One of the fun things of presenting remotely is you're dealing with dueling monitors, and

47:51.380 --> 47:56.380
I want to be able to see you guys, so I'm going to try one more thing while I present.

47:56.380 --> 48:00.380
It helps to be able to see both the slide deck.

48:00.380 --> 48:01.380
Okay.

48:01.380 --> 48:02.380
Excellent.

48:02.380 --> 48:05.380
Well, thank you so much for the honor to be here.

48:05.380 --> 48:07.380
I really appreciate the invitation.

48:07.380 --> 48:13.380
It was also really rewarding to get to listen to the aspirations that were covered in that

48:13.380 --> 48:14.380
last exercise.

48:14.380 --> 48:20.380
So a lot of what you shared will align with a lot of what I'm going to present here today.

48:20.380 --> 48:26.380
As Dr. Darley Hammond mentioned, I'm the Vice President of Policy and Advocacy at Knowledge

48:26.380 --> 48:27.380
Works.

48:27.380 --> 48:32.380
We are a nonprofit organization that supports policymakers and practitioners to design more

48:32.380 --> 48:39.380
student-centered systems and particularly focus on the redesign of assessment and accountability

48:39.380 --> 48:42.380
systems to support those student-centered practices.

48:42.380 --> 48:49.380
So I was asked to come here today to speak specifically to the national assessment trends.

48:49.380 --> 48:54.380
So what are we seeing in this moment in time where there's a lot of education, a lot of

48:54.380 --> 48:57.380
assessment innovation emerging around the country?

48:57.380 --> 49:04.380
So I'm going to cover some of those trends and then provide a little snapshot into some

49:04.380 --> 49:08.380
of the assessment tasks that we are seeing emerge in some of these states that are trying

49:08.380 --> 49:11.380
to design more authentic assessments.

49:11.380 --> 49:16.380
First, I want to start with anchoring in public opinion.

49:16.380 --> 49:24.380
So there are a number of surveys that have been conducted recently that are really illustrating

49:24.380 --> 49:31.380
that the public confidence right now in our school system is at an all-time low and that

49:31.380 --> 49:37.380
particularly we're seeing more of a call to better prepare students to build decent lives

49:37.380 --> 49:38.380
in their community.

49:38.380 --> 49:44.380
This notion that parents and students want more real-world skill building in schools

49:44.380 --> 49:50.380
and this belief from a majority, 74% of parents believe that the lack of personalization is

49:50.380 --> 49:53.380
the problem with today's school system.

49:53.380 --> 49:58.380
Lillian, are you trying to share your screen because we're not seeing your slides.

49:58.380 --> 49:59.380
Oh, you're not?

49:59.380 --> 50:00.380
Okay.

50:00.380 --> 50:01.380
Let me try that again.

50:01.380 --> 50:03.380
Let's see if you can try that again.

50:03.380 --> 50:04.380
Thank you.

50:04.380 --> 50:07.380
I happen to have seen your slides, so I know that that's your first slide.

50:07.380 --> 50:08.380
You know.

50:08.380 --> 50:09.380
You know.

50:09.380 --> 50:10.380
That's right.

50:10.380 --> 50:11.380
Okay.

50:11.380 --> 50:12.380
Let's see.

50:12.380 --> 50:13.380
Let's try this one more time.

50:13.380 --> 50:14.380
Yes.

50:14.380 --> 50:15.380
It's coming in.

50:15.380 --> 50:17.380
It says, wait as content sharing is launching.

50:17.380 --> 50:18.380
There it goes.

50:18.380 --> 50:19.380
We got you.

50:19.380 --> 50:23.380
You can put it on the slideshow, maybe.

50:23.380 --> 50:24.380
All right.

50:24.380 --> 50:27.380
Yep.

50:27.380 --> 50:28.380
Okay.

50:28.380 --> 50:30.380
Let's try that again.

50:31.380 --> 50:39.380
Going back, so re-anchoring public opinion at an all-time low, a desire for better preparing

50:39.380 --> 50:44.380
students to build decent lives in their community, this notion for more real-world skill building

50:44.380 --> 50:51.380
in schools, and this belief that a lack of personalization, so as I said, 74% of parents,

50:51.380 --> 50:56.380
that's a significant number, are saying that that is the problem.

50:56.380 --> 51:01.380
If we drill a little deeper and start to look at the concerns about summative assessments

51:01.380 --> 51:09.380
in particular, you can really start to see some issues emerging with our nation's education

51:09.380 --> 51:13.380
system, and none of these will be a surprise to each of you, as I hear the aspirations

51:13.380 --> 51:18.380
that you shared, but we're really hearing from stakeholders all over the country that,

51:18.380 --> 51:24.380
you know, this over-reliance on multiple-choice items is not capturing that deeper level of

51:24.380 --> 51:29.380
knowledge and skills that we know are essential to student success, and that means we're not

51:29.380 --> 51:34.380
actually getting the full picture of student mastery or school quality.

51:34.380 --> 51:41.380
Curriculum has become narrowed and often focused on this notion of test preparation, right,

51:41.380 --> 51:47.380
and we hear a lot of that means instructional time is lost and students are not really benefiting

51:47.380 --> 51:51.380
from the richness that you would hope to see in classroom settings.

51:51.380 --> 51:56.380
Data is not actionable for instruction, and oftentimes that data isn't valued in the

51:56.380 --> 52:02.380
classroom at all, and our students are experiencing testing stress, and they're also not

52:02.380 --> 52:08.380
seeing themselves in assessments. They're not culturally or linguistically inclusive.

52:08.380 --> 52:13.380
So I'm going to bring forward kind of two sources of information as I talk about the trends

52:13.380 --> 52:18.380
that we're seeing emerge around the country to try to address some of those concerns that are

52:18.380 --> 52:21.380
emerging around our assessment systems.

52:21.380 --> 52:26.380
The first is the report that Dr. Darling-Hammond mentioned, which is called Measuring Forward.

52:26.380 --> 52:32.380
This was a report that was put out from a group of organizations that are working together at the

52:32.380 --> 52:39.380
federal level to help educate policymakers about the trends that are emerging in states around the

52:39.380 --> 52:44.380
country as they are seeking to build more innovative assessment systems, and it was really an

52:44.380 --> 52:50.380
attempt to try to capture as much of the information we could find in states as they're asking

52:50.380 --> 52:55.380
critical questions and beginning to design new approaches to assessment.

52:55.380 --> 53:02.380
And the second is recent interest from the federal level to increase funding for the competitive

53:02.380 --> 53:05.380
grants for state assessments program.

53:05.380 --> 53:10.380
So you can see in 2020 about just about 12 million was going out the door to support states

53:10.380 --> 53:17.380
through competitive grants to support new innovative assessment approaches, and that funded by states.

53:17.380 --> 53:24.380
2022, the next year of that competition, $29 million was going out to support 10 states or actually

53:24.380 --> 53:30.380
11 awards, but one state was very lucky and got two of those awards.

53:30.380 --> 53:37.380
So an infusion of federal funding is actually at play in helping fuel some of the interest in

53:37.380 --> 53:39.380
assessment innovation.

53:39.380 --> 53:44.380
So if you look at the map, you can see where this innovation is happening.

53:44.380 --> 53:50.380
So the lighter blue states are the states that were featured in that measuring forward report.

53:50.380 --> 53:56.380
The yellow states are states that received awards from that competitive grant program at the federal

53:56.380 --> 54:03.380
level in 2022, and the green states are the states that not already had work underway, and it was

54:03.380 --> 54:10.380
cited in that report and also received a grant from the federal government in that last competition.

54:10.380 --> 54:13.380
So you can see the footprint is pretty significant.

54:13.380 --> 54:18.380
There's a tremendous amount of activity happening around the country, again, responding to those

54:18.380 --> 54:25.380
stakeholder concerns about problems with current assessments and a demand for a new approach in our

54:25.380 --> 54:28.380
school systems.

54:28.380 --> 54:35.380
So as we began to look at the trends across these states, we really saw them organizing around two

54:35.380 --> 54:37.380
big buckets.

54:37.380 --> 54:40.380
The first are these innovative design elements.

54:40.380 --> 54:47.380
So what are the types of designs that states are looking at as they are exploring new approaches to

54:47.380 --> 54:48.380
assessment?

54:48.380 --> 54:54.380
And then the second category is how are states actually beginning to put supports in place to build

54:54.380 --> 55:00.380
their system capacity for the creation of more innovative approaches to assessment?

55:00.380 --> 55:09.380
So if we start with those assessment designs, there's really five areas that we saw emerging across

55:09.380 --> 55:17.380
those states, and I'll note that it's important to remember that an assessment approach often

55:17.380 --> 55:21.380
incorporates several or many of these design elements.

55:21.380 --> 55:23.380
They are definitely not mutually exclusive.

55:23.380 --> 55:28.380
In fact, they're great when they incorporate many of these elements, if not all.

55:28.380 --> 55:34.380
So know that while I'll talk about them in isolation, the designs we're seeing emerge are really

55:34.380 --> 55:37.380
tackling many of these elements.

55:37.380 --> 55:39.380
So instructionally embedded assessments.

55:39.380 --> 55:43.380
So these are assessments that are not divorced from the curriculum.

55:43.380 --> 55:49.380
They're not happening in a separate experience that have no connection to the curriculum that has been

55:49.380 --> 55:51.380
administered throughout the year.

55:51.380 --> 55:57.380
So students are sort of aware of kind of the content, the topics they've experienced, and it's building

55:57.380 --> 56:01.380
on what they're doing in the classroom.

56:01.380 --> 56:08.380
Performance assessments enable students to really demonstrate mastery of a conceptual understanding in

56:08.380 --> 56:10.380
a new or novel context.

56:10.380 --> 56:15.380
So this might be things like, you know, a complex writing prompt.

56:15.380 --> 56:20.380
It might include something like a science experiment.

56:20.380 --> 56:26.380
So I love to include this nontraditional graduation requirements because we often hear from states

56:26.380 --> 56:32.380
it's really hard to innovate right now because of the constraining environment at the federal level.

56:32.380 --> 56:38.380
And while I would concur that there are significant constraints at the federal level, it's really

56:38.380 --> 56:44.380
interesting to see states beginning to move into the graduation requirement space as an area

56:44.380 --> 56:50.380
that's completely within their authority to begin to build capacity within their state for more

56:50.380 --> 56:52.380
authentic assessment experiences.

56:52.380 --> 56:59.380
And so this is where we're seeing states, you know, either provide opportunities for students to,

56:59.380 --> 57:04.380
instead of maybe completing a traditional course sequence, to engage in a rich performance capstone

57:04.380 --> 57:11.380
experience or a portfolio defense as a means of earning a diploma and demonstrating mastery of the

57:11.380 --> 57:19.380
knowledge and skills and dispositions that the state has outlined are critical for success.

57:19.380 --> 57:23.380
So I'm stuck.

57:23.380 --> 57:24.380
There we go.

57:24.380 --> 57:26.380
Shared quality criteria.

57:26.380 --> 57:33.380
So these are the tools and templates and processes that need to be created alongside these new

57:33.380 --> 57:37.380
assessment tasks that help educators have common language.

57:37.380 --> 57:40.380
So what does success look like on an assessment?

57:40.380 --> 57:48.380
How am I supposed to interpret and have common expectations as I'm scoring these assessments at their

57:48.380 --> 57:50.380
classroom base?

57:50.380 --> 57:56.380
What kind of standardization needs to happen across that experience to ensure that we are experiencing

57:56.380 --> 58:00.380
quality implementation from one district to the next?

58:00.380 --> 58:05.380
And the last, and we heard some reference to this right at the end of the exercise you were just doing,

58:05.380 --> 58:07.380
so task and item banks.

58:07.380 --> 58:11.380
So there's a lot of interest around the country in this particular area.

58:11.380 --> 58:20.380
So the idea that either a state or a vendor or teachers are creating a set of performance tasks,

58:20.380 --> 58:27.380
rich assessment items that are validated in some way by some sort of third party to ensure that they

58:27.380 --> 58:32.380
are of a high quality and aligned to the expectations of learning in the state.

58:32.380 --> 58:38.380
And then they live in a bank that then educators can pull from at any time and use in their classroom

58:38.380 --> 58:39.380
experience.

58:39.380 --> 58:45.380
And I think this has become an attractive option because it is helpful for managing quality but also

58:45.380 --> 58:50.380
provides flexibility to educators to use as needed to support their instruction.

58:50.380 --> 58:55.380
So the second bucket was system capacity.

58:55.380 --> 59:01.380
There has been an explosion of advisory committees across the country.

59:01.380 --> 59:07.380
States are beginning to bring their diverse stakeholders together to ask these critical questions.

59:07.380 --> 59:09.380
What vision do we want for assessments?

59:09.380 --> 59:13.380
What innovative assessment designs might we want to consider?

59:13.380 --> 59:19.380
I'm trying to make it a more engaging process than previous assessment design processes have been in

59:19.380 --> 59:21.380
states in the past.

59:21.380 --> 59:26.380
At the same time, we're seeing a lot of interest in assessment literacy, professional development.

59:26.380 --> 59:31.380
So if we're going to bring more authentic assessment practices into states, we need to make sure that

59:31.380 --> 59:37.380
educators have the supports necessary to be successful and to be able to implement the data from those

59:37.380 --> 59:40.380
assessments in their classroom in meaningful ways.

59:40.380 --> 59:45.380
And some states have taken that a step farther to say we actually want to build an entire professional

59:45.380 --> 59:52.380
learning community, a network of educators and leaders that convene regularly to test best practices,

59:52.380 --> 59:59.380
to calibrate scoring of assessment tasks, to really deepen their knowledge across the state and build

59:59.380 --> 01:00:01.380
quality.

01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:04.380
And the last off-lag is the multistate network.

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:10.380
So that learning community, not just happening within states, but we are beginning to see states working

01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:17.380
together to tackle these challenges because the challenges are common in many ways.

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:19.380
They're facing the same concerns from stakeholders.

01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:24.380
And there's a lot of interest in creating some efficiencies and learning and exploring those assessment

01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:26.380
solutions together.

01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:33.380
So I'm going to feature a couple states, some examples of performance tasks that we're seeing emerge, just to

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:38.380
give you a little bit of a flavor of what these types of tasks look like.

01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:41.380
I wanted to start with Massachusetts.

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:47.380
So they are in the process of building out an innovative science pilot assessment.

01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:55.380
This was actually an assessment that has been approved to pilot through the Federal Innovative Assessment

01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:57.380
Demonstration Authority.

01:00:57.380 --> 01:01:03.380
Massachusetts is a state that's always been at the top in the nation for performance on their state MCAS

01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:05.380
assessments.

01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:13.380
But what the state is beginning to notice is that they are creating ineffective teaching practices that have

01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:20.380
spread across the state because teachers are teaching to ensure success on that assessment, but we're losing

01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:25.380
a lot of the deeper learning experiences that they know are so critical to their post-secondary and workforce

01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:27.380
partners.

01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:32.380
And so they wanted to push their own thinking about what assessment could look like in the state and begin to

01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:34.380
bring in these richer assessment tasks.

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:37.380
So they're looking at fifth and eighth grade.

01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:41.380
They may expand to high school in future years based on how the pilot goes.

01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:44.380
But they're being intentional about creating a system.

01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:48.380
I think this is an important thing to really focus in on.

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:54.380
So while they're looking at adding these summative or these performance tasks in their summative assessments,

01:01:54.380 --> 01:02:01.380
they're being intentional about aligning these classroom embedded performance tasks as well so that students are

01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:06.380
experiencing these concepts of learning in a classroom-based environment.

01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:14.380
And when they get to the summative tasks, they're familiar with how to navigate some of these rich simulations with new

01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:19.380
content, of course, as they're evaluated on those assessments.

01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:25.380
So you can see there are some of the goals very similar and meant to address some of the concerns that I shared earlier,

01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:27.380
trying to get a more deeper learning.

01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:30.380
They want improvements in classroom instruction.

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:37.380
They want to make sure that this is engaging and culturally inclusive and relevant for students.

01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:39.380
A couple enabling conditions.

01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:45.380
So as I mentioned, they did receive federal approval for the Innovative Assessment Demonstration Authority.

01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:50.380
At the same time, they received almost a $3 million reward from the U.S.

01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:57.380
Department of Education in 2020, and they've received additional philanthropic investment to support that work.

01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:05.380
So this is a snapshot, and I really want to emphasize snapshot, because these performance tasks are rich.

01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:10.380
They are pages of depth and instruction.

01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:15.380
And so what you were looking at is component three of an eight-step task.

01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:21.380
But the reason I wanted to take this image is because it shows you a simulation.

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:24.380
And again, remember, this is a summative assessment.

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:36.380
So what the student here is being asked to do is they're going to manipulate this simulation to look at these barriers in the bottom left corner.

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:39.380
So there's a U barrier, a J barrier, and an I barrier.

01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:49.380
And they're going to try different barriers out in the simulation while adjusting the amount of rainfall to try to determine which

01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:57.380
barrier is most effective for reducing the amount of sediment that's going to flow here into this lake.

01:03:57.380 --> 01:04:02.380
And so what they're being asked to do is to run five different barrier designs.

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:08.380
And those will populate up in the A, B, C, D, and E categories there at the top of the simulation.

01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:16.380
And at the end, they're going to use that information to make determinations about which barrier they think is most effective.

01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:24.380
And you can see while they do have to use drop-down approaches here, again, there's some limitations around the summative requirements and the technical

01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:29.380
quality implications that are set out through the federal peer review requirements.

01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:41.380
They are able to require these students to put their saved model in here to show that they completed the performance task and that their saved model was the best example.

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:50.380
So there may be different responses that students would share here and still receive a correct score.

01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:57.380
So the state, as I mentioned, has aligned performance tasks that are classroom-based.

01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:59.380
And so this is an example.

01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:03.380
There's a lot of words here, and I'll sort of talk you through what's going on here.

01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:16.380
So an educator would be using this type of a task in the classroom experience to ensure that the student is getting experience with things like designing of simulations.

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:20.380
So this particular performance task is getting at Newton's third law.

01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:23.380
We're looking at collisions in soccer.

01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:27.380
So they're given sort of three different scenarios in which collisions happen.

01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:37.380
So you have a header collision where you head a ball, you have two players that collide, and then you have a player that would hit their head on the ground.

01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:41.380
And there's some different attributes to what might happen in those collisions.

01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:48.380
And they're going to draw and explain how the amount of force on the head would compare to the force on the object across these different scenarios.

01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:52.380
They would be working in individual work as they're thinking about that.

01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:54.380
Then they might switch to group work.

01:05:55.380 --> 01:06:00.380
And I really truncated this down, but some examples of some of the group work prompts.

01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:07.380
So they would actually design a simulation to look at the difference between mass and speed.

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:14.380
And so they might use a cart and a block, and they would have a similar simulation like you saw in the previous slide.

01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:17.380
And they would create a data table in their science notebook.

01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:20.380
They might be asked to manipulate the speed in certain ones.

01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:25.380
They might be asked to manipulate the mass and they record that data as a group and make observations.

01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:30.380
And then they might also be given things like Play-Doh or a paper towel or a sheet of foam.

01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:40.380
And they might be asked to design an investigation and again to receive a series of prompts to come to some conclusions about which different materials affect the force of a collision.

01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:46.380
The second state I wanted to share was Hawaii.

01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:56.380
Hawaii is also trying to balance a system of assessments where they have these smarter, balanced, shortened, summative, computer-adaptive assessments

01:06:56.380 --> 01:07:04.380
complemented by these teacher-developed, classroom-based assessments through what they're calling the Performance Assessment Development Initiative.

01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:12.380
They are trying to tackle all of the federally required tested grades, the 3 through 8, once in high school, in ELA, in math.

01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:24.380
They're really trying to be intentional in this pilot right now around calibrating those performance expectations between the PATI assessments and smarter balance so that there's coherence in their system.

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:31.380
They want to make sure that educators have access to training as they're accessing the task space.

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:35.380
They want aligned curriculum guidance for every single task.

01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:45.380
They're looking at building assessment literacy, and they're also asking this question about whether they should develop and adopt a skills profile on each of the individual student reports.

01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:51.380
So in addition to kind of that knowledge acquisition, looking at how skills are emerging for students as well.

01:07:51.380 --> 01:08:01.380
They also have received two federal grants that have supported this work, and they continue to say they're looking towards applying for the Innovative Assessment Demonstration Authority,

01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:07.380
but currently are working on building the capacity around these classroom-based assessments.

01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:12.380
And just a quick example from Hawaii, this is a grade 6 ELA task.

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:22.380
So this is about tourism in Hawaii, really trying to bring the community experience that students would be familiar with from their everyday life.

01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:25.380
And they're focused on argumentative writing.

01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:32.380
So in this particular example, the state government of Hawaii needs to make a decision about tourism,

01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:43.380
and students would receive examples of evidence from across a range of texts, might look at tax receipts, might look at effects on the environment,

01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:55.380
and they're going to read through all of those sources, and they are going to form their own argumentative position on what the state government should do.

01:08:55.380 --> 01:09:00.380
So the last one I wanted to mention is the multi-state collaborative.

01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:05.380
So again, as I mentioned, states are starting to band together to try to solve some of these issues.

01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:09.380
So the SPA-LC, which is the State Performance Assessment Learning Community,

01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:19.380
is now over 25 states that are working together to develop these more authentic statewide assessment systems that are centering high quality teaching and learning.

01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:23.380
And what I actually wanted to share, so again, they're working on best practice.

01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:27.380
They've recently developed a set of design principles.

01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:30.380
So we need to think about quality when we're building these systems.

01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:35.380
So what do they say are the critical design principles for the development of these systems?

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:41.380
So they came up with six, and the first was that these assessments need to be authentic.

01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:48.380
So if, you know, if we know a particular discipline requires master of certain knowledge and skills,

01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:54.380
how are the assessments centering those concepts in the assessment experience?

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:56.380
They need to be anchored in the curriculum, right?

01:09:56.380 --> 01:10:01.380
So not divorced from the curriculum, but really embedded and informed by the curriculum experience.

01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:09.380
They need to be educative, which means that educators and students are building their understanding of teaching and learning.

01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:16.380
So one of the common criticisms about multiple choice tests is that they reinforce ineffective teaching.

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:19.380
It's exactly the problem that Massachusetts is trying to solve.

01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:25.380
So how do we ensure that the assessments that we're designing are reinforcing that really good,

01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:30.380
high quality teaching and learning that we want to see in the classroom experience?

01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:34.380
We want to ensure assessments are developmental and asset-granted.

01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:36.380
So what do students know?

01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:40.380
We don't want to just tell students you're failing in science, you're bad in science.

01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:42.380
What does a student know?

01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:50.380
What can they do while also surfacing the progress relative to that student's own performance?

01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:55.380
I already mentioned principles of universal design for learning, cultural responsiveness.

01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:56.380
Those are critical.

01:10:56.380 --> 01:11:00.380
We want to make sure that assessments are reflective of and responsive to learners.

01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:06.380
And lastly, that assessments are being used to influence instruction.

01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:16.380
So that data is coming at appropriate times and at a source of information that's meaningful for educators that they can use to improve their instruction.

01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:23.380
And the last thought I'll leave you with before I close is really centering in this moment.

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:27.380
So why is now a good time for states to design more authentic assessments?

01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:31.380
Why are we seeing this explosion of interest?

01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:36.380
So as I mentioned at the beginning of my presentation, so stakeholder demand is at an all-time high.

01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:41.380
I have yet to find a state that I have entered that loves their current assessments.

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.380
Stakeholders want something different.

01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:47.380
At the same time, federal leaders are looking for state proof points.

01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:55.380
I was just on the phone this morning with the Senate Health Committee, and they are saying we want to know what states are doing.

01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:58.380
We need help understanding what's possible.

01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:01.380
Federal and philanthropic investments are growing.

01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:08.380
Improvements in technology are really changing what's possible when we think about the design of assessments.

01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:10.380
There are other states to learn from and with.

01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:12.380
You don't have to do this alone.

01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:21.380
There are so many state networks that are emerging that are asking common questions, and it's encouraging and comforting to know that there are others.

01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:24.380
And lastly, there's many pathways to innovation.

01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:30.380
So sure, you could tackle that summative assessment, but you could also focus on rich formative assessments.

01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:32.380
You could look at graduation requirements.

01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:35.380
You could even focus on building out these shared learning frameworks.

01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:45.380
So how do we evolve from our standards, which are critical, but also begin to think about these knowledge and skills and dispositions that we know are essential to student success.

01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:48.380
So lots of opportunity out there to innovate.

01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:50.380
It's a really exciting time.

01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:54.380
And there's rich examples that are emerging all over the country to learn from.

01:12:54.380 --> 01:13:01.380
And with that, I will go ahead and close out and pass to a colleague.

01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:04.380
Thank you so much.

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:10.380
We're going to move pretty quickly to our next speaker, but I do want to see if there are any clarifying questions that people have.

01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:16.380
And then we'll come back around for deeper questions after we've gone through the panel.

01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:21.380
Any clarifying questions?

01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:24.380
Some applause over here.

01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:26.380
Let me just ask one.

01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:38.380
When you were describing, for example, the rich tasks in Massachusetts, are those being designed in such a way, going back to the question that Cynthia asked, that they'll be able to produce comparable,

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:44.380
aggregable scores at the end of the process?

01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:45.380
Yes, absolutely.

01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:53.380
So because this particular assessment is being designed through the Federal Innovative Assessment Demonstration Authority,

01:13:53.380 --> 01:14:01.380
that assessment will go through the ringer of federal peer review to make sure that it is meeting all of those designations.

01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:09.380
And so the state has really been working to try to figure out how to ensure that they can meet standards around comparability.

01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:15.380
They have a team of technical experts that have been helping them do just that.

01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:26.380
And so it's our understanding that they have not only hit that standard, but they are receiving some early results that they're still going to be vetting,

01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:39.380
but that show that students in these innovative environments, that they're actually seeing gap closure from the students who are at the very sort of lowest levels on the proficiency scale.

01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:46.380
They're seeing those students come up, whereas the comparable results for students on the MCAS, there's no movement.

01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:57.380
So because they were able to achieve a standard of comparability, they're able to begin to make those kind of determinations about the effectiveness of this innovative science approach.

01:14:57.380 --> 01:14:59.380
Thank you.

01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:07.380
And speaking of science, our next speaker is going to come on and Steve Pruitt should be appearing momentarily.

01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:13.380
And Steve is sort of the godfather of the next generation science standards.

01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:25.380
He oversaw the process of developing the standards and then went off to be commissioner in Kentucky and is now the president of the Southern Regional Education Board

01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:33.380
and can tell us everything there is to know about science standards and assessments.

01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:38.380
Steve is coming on. There we go. Thank you. Great to see you.

01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:43.380
Thank you. That's such a nice intro. I appreciate that.

01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:51.380
It is great to be back with the California State Board of Ed. It's been quite a while since I've been with you and I wish I could be in Sacramento.

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:56.380
I always enjoyed that trip.

01:15:56.380 --> 01:16:05.380
As Linda said, I've been with this whole NGSS thing since the beginning, since the actual framework was even being developed.

01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:10.380
So I know we're running a little short on time, so I'm going to run through my presentation fairly quickly.

01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:20.380
But what I hope to show you are that when these were developed, when the framework for K-12 science education was developed by the National Research Council

01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:26.380
and subsequently the next generation science standards were developed by the 26th lead state,

01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:35.380
it was with the reality of where we were headed in the workforce and where we were headed in terms of our economics and workforce environment.

01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:46.380
We have entered this fourth industrial revolution and therefore the idea that we can simply stay with recall and that sort of thing on assessment,

01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:52.380
which ultimately drives how we do a lot of instruction, we knew we had to really move away from that.

01:16:52.380 --> 01:17:02.380
You could go in right now and into an AI program that's easily accessible on your phone and you could write an entire report just based on a few questions.

01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:08.380
So it really drives home the point that computers are no longer learning from us, they're learning with us.

01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:15.380
The thinking that goes into this is a whole other level than what we have traditionally seen.

01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:23.380
So when the NGSS were developed, it was developed with the idea, I used to say, to perturb the system.

01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:30.380
If you ask some psychometricians, or as I call them, psychomagicians, because they do magical things with numbers,

01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:38.380
they would say we might have even broken the system because for the first time we were really focused on a three-dimensional perspective

01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:42.380
and most importantly, a three-dimensional performance.

01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:48.380
These standards were developed with the specific intent that students do science rather than view science,

01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:54.380
that it was really something that helped, that focused on making sense of the things around them.

01:17:54.380 --> 01:18:00.380
So I'm not going to go through this in depth, but I'm going to start here quickly.

01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:09.380
As Linda mentioned, I am a former state superintendent of Kentucky Education System

01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:14.380
and have gone through a similar process once you guys are going through.

01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:19.380
You really do have to take some time and know where you want to go.

01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:22.380
This is not just, oh, we want to go build some tests.

01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:28.380
Lillian did a really nice job of laying that out. There's some real conversations that have to be had.

01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:34.380
The thing I'm going to point out on this slide just very quickly is the reporting versus messaging at the end.

01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:39.380
I believe reporting is actually still an untapped conversation.

01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:48.380
I think that states could do some really great things if they really think about how they want to report the assessment results

01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:53.380
and how that messages to the field what's expected of our classroom teachers.

01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:59.380
But that is a pretty in-depth conversation, and so I would just say to start with that.

01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:05.380
Very quickly, all of you, I'm sure, have been around or you've heard people talk about the science.

01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:08.380
Basically, there are three dimensions.

01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:13.380
Scientific engineering practices, which is how scientists accumulate and communicate knowledge.

01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:20.380
Cross-cutting concepts, or how we look at phenomena and how things are connected across the different branches of science.

01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:26.380
And of course, disciplinary core ideas is the stuff. It's the content that we all know and some of us love.

01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:38.380
When the standards were being developed, if you've ever looked at them, you've seen that there are not the traditional verbs that are in standards.

01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:46.380
We intentionally went away from the web's depth of knowledge or the Piaget verb,

01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:51.380
because what wanted to drive were the science and engineering practice.

01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:58.380
In other words, again, a way to message students should be performing these, not simply learning those.

01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:05.380
It was a very long and deliberate conversation that these were not going to be called just standards.

01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:08.380
These are student performance expectations.

01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:15.380
And so doing this is actually kind of an interesting thing because when we talk about cognitive complexity, it changes.

01:20:15.380 --> 01:20:20.380
I'm not going to go through this slide very in-depth, except I'll point out, notice the blue.

01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:24.380
Use models to organize, use models to predict, use models to communicate.

01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:33.380
These practices are at such a cognitive level, they actually just doing on a multiple-choice test, you would not actually meet the spirit of those standards.

01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:36.380
Cross-cutting concepts are the same way.

01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:42.380
It allows us to look at different aspects of phenomena, whether it be patterns, causality, or even systems.

01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:47.380
This is actually a nice representation that comes out of San Diego County.

01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:57.380
So blending these different core ideas, we have life sciences, engineering, earth, space, and physical sciences.

01:20:57.380 --> 01:21:09.380
And the whole idea is at the end of the day, students make sense of phenomena by blending these three things to use as evidence to explain the phenomena or the problem they're trying to solve.

01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:14.380
I'm going to quickly run through this because I know we're running short on time.

01:21:14.380 --> 01:21:22.380
I wanted to give you a quick look at how instruction is being approached in many ways.

01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:34.380
At SREB, we actually developed a set of instructional practices of how teachers could be constructing their instruction in such a way that it actually would get to the three-dimensional aspect.

01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:42.380
So they are basically a practice to making sense of phenomena, developing questions to plan and carry out investigations or design solutions,

01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:53.380
gathering data, reasoning how evidence supports the explanation for the causes of the phenomena, engaging in academic discourse, presenting evidence of learning,

01:21:53.380 --> 01:22:00.380
communicating reasoning through individual performance, and applying science learning beyond the classroom.

01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:02.380
Here's what I want to point out to you.

01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:06.380
This was developed with the intent of the framework in the NGSS.

01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:11.380
So look at how many of those things are performance-based.

01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:30.380
So when thinking about a new test, a new assessment for your state, the very intent of that is really about pulling students' knowledge out of them and let them really show how they can interpret what they are seeing and what kind of evidence they're able to collect.

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:44.380
Throughout the entire realm of instruction, the whole design was that you should constantly be assessing, whether it be formative assessment, midpoint, summative, all of those things are going to be evident.

01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:47.380
For the sake of time, I'm not going to really go through this.

01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:57.380
You all have this, but what I did was I laid out for you how a teacher may consider going through and developing instruction.

01:22:57.380 --> 01:23:10.380
These three performance expectations actually would be used together in this unit of instruction, and so the assessment would actually be reflective of all three of those performance expectations.

01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:16.380
But what I'd like to do is sort of move us into talking about process a little bit.

01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:19.380
This is actually the flow of instruction.

01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:25.380
So again, investigation, phenomena, develop a model.

01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:31.380
It's really hard to develop a model onto simply a multiple-choice test.

01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:38.380
All of these standards were really, from the very get-go, developed so that students could perform what they know.

01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:41.380
It's a way to overcome a lot of different barriers.

01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:55.380
It's a way to overcome a lot of different bias that traditional standardized assessment creates, especially with some of our students who are struggling with English learning or are actually our traditionally underserved population.

01:23:55.380 --> 01:24:02.380
Like I said, I'm going to just skim through this because I want to get to this last part.

01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:12.380
When we talk about assessing 3D standards, the things that we've seen, I'm not going to repeat these because Lillian did such a great job of pointing these out.

01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:25.380
But these are things that part came from the Board on Testing and Assessment, which is another arm of the National Academies of Science, when they did a study on how should we be assessing the next generation science standards.

01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:49.380
And what they came out with was the idea of a true system of assessment, meaning that the one-stop snapshot is simply not enough to be able to fully see if students are able to fully make their thinking visible and to make sense out of the different aspects that they have.

01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:53.380
I'm going to point out Nebraska as an example here.

01:24:53.380 --> 01:25:00.380
I actually had the opportunity to work with Nebraska in the early stages of their developing their task library.

01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:08.380
This was a really great idea, and I think what it does is it allows teachers to be so much more involved in the assessment process.

01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:14.380
So many things we do with assessment, we have to tell teachers, hey, don't read the test.

01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:15.380
There's a security issue.

01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:18.380
Hey, we're going to just send you the report.

01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:30.380
Doing things with curriculum embedded instruction and with task libraries actually gives an open window that allows teachers to feel like they really are part of the assessment system.

01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:34.380
Having teachers feel left out is a major problem.

01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:38.380
And this was a great way to be able to do this.

01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:42.380
So Nebraska, they developed a secure set of tasks.

01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:48.380
In this, the teachers can use these tasks as part of a school or district-wide assessment initiative.

01:25:48.380 --> 01:26:01.380
Some districts used them with their own systems and some did more creative things with them with creating, for instance, learning modules as well as task templates.

01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:09.380
So there's an example here where they're looking at the human adaptation on the Tabishan Plateau.

01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:17.380
And students are using these or teachers are using these rather during instruction to do checkpoints.

01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:33.380
And again, one of the things that kind of I think has created a lot of issues in the current set of standardized assessments is the distrust that teachers have of what's really on the test, who really makes that decision, and does it really reflect what my students know?

01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:38.380
And having these task libraries are pretty incredible.

01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:42.380
I'm going to talk about that a little bit more in just a second and you'll see why.

01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:44.380
I also just wanted to point this out.

01:26:44.380 --> 01:27:00.380
AP Computer Science has done a really interesting thing with their AP Computer Science principles task work, where they actually, they're basically between six and eight performances that students need to do in this course.

01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:06.380
And it leads toward their overall summative assessment of their AP score.

01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:18.380
In Kentucky, what we did was we took this, we formed a partnership with Code.org and with College Board, and we actually use this as a science course.

01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:26.380
Now, I personally have issues when we just make computer science blanketly a science course.

01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:33.380
But in this case, we felt good about it because the six to eight projects were all based in science content.

01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:39.380
A science teacher was trained in how to do the instruction here.

01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:55.380
And at the end, these performance tasks not only gave us a great view of how they were able to manage computer science principles, it also gave us a great view of how much they were able to make their thinking visible because of the projects they were able to prove that,

01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:59.380
hey, I really understand plate tectonics.

01:27:59.380 --> 01:28:01.380
I really understand how erosion works.

01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:14.380
I really understand weather systems because they were developing these computer-based simulations and modules that actually showed the science, but also to meet the function of the actual AP course.

01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:26.380
Those were aggregated and were able to be used to determine whether the student was successful and had earned college credit in the AP course itself.

01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:30.380
So here's what I'd like to very briefly leave you with.

01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:34.380
As Linda mentioned, I'm the former commissioner of education in Kentucky.

01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:45.380
You can imagine being the godfather, as Linda said, of NGSS, no state I ever was going to be in charge of was ever not going to do science.

01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:50.380
And we certainly were not going to not do science the way it was intended.

01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:54.380
So when I got to Kentucky, there had already been a lot of work done.

01:28:54.380 --> 01:29:05.380
And we were committed in Kentucky to making teachers an integral partner in developing our assessments, but we were also committed to having a full system of assessment.

01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:18.380
So we basically had a couple of goals that we wanted each component of the system, which included classroom embedded assessment, through course tasks, and state summative assessment.

01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:24.380
We wanted to really make sure that each of those purposes were clear, were clear.

01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:31.380
And in particular, we wanted the through course task to be a process for calibrating three dimensional instruction and student outcomes.

01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:34.380
So the three things work together.

01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:36.380
In short, here's what happened.

01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:41.380
Classroom embedded assessment were developed by teachers in their building.

01:29:41.380 --> 01:29:45.380
We provided a lot of a lot of professional development.

01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:55.380
Through course tasks were created by we brought together roughly 100 teachers and taught them over a couple of years how to write these tasks.

01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:58.380
We vetted them. We did all the things that needed to be done.

01:29:58.380 --> 01:30:04.380
And then I used to kind of jokingly refer to it as the assessment closet where Nebraska College Library.

01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:14.380
My thing was teachers should be able to go to an assessment closet, pull out their task at the right time of the year and be able to provide that to their students to give checkpoints.

01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:17.380
And then, of course, the state summative assessment.

01:30:17.380 --> 01:30:22.380
I'm going to talk about the through course task here in more detail in just a moment.

01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:32.380
So we wanted to reflect on the process and structures that are in place or that need to be and identify ways to support implementation of the three components of the assessment system.

01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:37.380
These were the three things that we wanted to be number one in our priority.

01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:40.380
We set those before we ever set anything else in motion.

01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:46.380
So the way all of this works is all of these things should provide evidence that students are learning the standard.

01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:49.380
KAS stands for Kentucky Academic Standards.

01:30:49.380 --> 01:30:54.380
They were also an NGSS state are also an NGSS state.

01:30:54.380 --> 01:30:57.380
So all of these things should be working together.

01:30:57.380 --> 01:31:01.380
So it was a full on system.

01:31:01.380 --> 01:31:06.380
The through course test process, which is what I wanted to spend the majority of my time on.

01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:09.380
And I know I'm running late here.

01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:24.380
Was actually developed to be a process that allowed for us to provide a lot of training on how to plan for the task facilitation, how to actually facilitate tasks and how to post the task analysis.

01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:30.380
We did a very thorough job of doing PD throughout the state.

01:31:30.380 --> 01:31:40.380
We used 100 teachers who were writing these also as the champions and also the trainers so that there was this whole proliferation of hey, there's nothing to hide here.

01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:43.380
You guys get to be a part of this system.

01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:47.380
We also designed it where a third of that group rolled off every year.

01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:54.380
So we always were bringing new blood to the table for the development and for the review of student work.

01:31:54.380 --> 01:31:59.380
In this, what we did was we felt like and we know how it was in Kentucky.

01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:01.380
It's a very local control state.

01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:05.380
We could not be seen as controlling the curriculum from Frankfurt.

01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:11.380
So we made a focus on saying here are through course tasks.

01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:13.380
They were at every grade level.

01:32:13.380 --> 01:32:16.380
Every school had to do three a year.

01:32:16.380 --> 01:32:17.380
But here's the deal.

01:32:17.380 --> 01:32:20.380
We did not make that part of accountability, at least at first.

01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:35.380
And we said the one thing you've got to do is you've got to collect student work and follow our student work protocol and deliver one piece of student work, just one, to the to the Department of Education every year.

01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:41.380
And then we convened about 200 teachers to go through the student work protocol at the state level.

01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:46.380
And we reviewed the state, the student work review of the teachers at the school level.

01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:54.380
And what that did was it allowed us to really evaluate that student work relative to the to the success criteria.

01:32:54.380 --> 01:33:00.380
It helped us refine practices based on shared experience with teachers really got to collaborate and understand.

01:33:00.380 --> 01:33:04.380
Oh, I didn't realize that's what students should be doing.

01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:10.380
It helped them under expand their understanding of what their own instructional decisions were all about.

01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:16.380
But for us at the department, what it did was it gave us representative sampling of what was going on throughout the state.

01:33:16.380 --> 01:33:22.380
It helped us see if students were really utilizing sense making.

01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:26.380
It was not used to evaluate district schools or teachers.

01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:28.380
It helped us define student capacities.

01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:29.380
But here's the big deal.

01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:35.380
It also informed the Department of Education on what our future professional learning should look like.

01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:41.380
If we could see where, oh, our teachers are still struggling with student work analysis, we design that.

01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:50.380
If we saw we're still not really getting the whole 3D or they're not getting this particular practice or they're not getting this particular content,

01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:59.380
we were able to stay level to redesign PD very specifically to be able to support those students.

01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:05.380
So with that, I will cede my time, but I'm going to stop with just one final thought here.

01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:08.380
And I know I really ran through that quickly.

01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:12.380
This is a great opportunity, and Lillian's absolutely right.

01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:14.380
The time is right.

01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:20.380
When I was the commissioner in Kentucky, I had a lot of opportunities, some I sort of took.

01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:24.380
I frankly had a rather public disagreement with the department at that time.

01:34:24.380 --> 01:34:31.380
And it was actually about the same time California was having a pretty significant disagreement with the department.

01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:35.380
And basically, we said, we're going to get this right.

01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:39.380
And I told the testing vendor, I said, I signed your check.

01:34:39.380 --> 01:34:45.380
And if you don't do exactly what our folks say need to be done, I'm not going to sign your check.

01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:50.380
And it's amazing how quickly they get on board when that happens.

01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:54.380
And so it was a very deliberate.

01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:55.380
It took time.

01:34:55.380 --> 01:34:56.380
It took effort.

01:34:56.380 --> 01:35:01.380
It took realizing that teachers had to be a partner in what we were doing.

01:35:01.380 --> 01:35:09.380
And then the last thing I'll say is I go back to I laid out the goals for what we wanted to do from the very beginning.

01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:16.380
As the State Board of Education and as the Department of Education, setting out those clear goals keep you on track.

01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:19.380
And this is not going to be something you can flip a switch.

01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:29.380
It's going to take time, going to take investment, but it's worth it because the way our students are going to be involved in the workforce going forward,

01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:36.380
the way they can be successful and be part of the economy is they are going to have to be involved in performance assessment.

01:35:36.380 --> 01:35:46.380
And I say that because every day of their life is going to be that we're predicting in the South that by 2030, we may see as many as 18 million unemployable adults,

01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:56.380
not unemployed, unemployable, because they simply don't have the skills to be involved in a workforce that is going to be demanding of performance

01:35:56.380 --> 01:36:05.380
and of critical thinking and of taking their task and making sense of it to be a part of that.

01:36:05.380 --> 01:36:08.380
I mean, we already know you can't go to a McDonald's and just order.

01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:10.380
You have to order it on a giant iPad.

01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:13.380
My wife and I had dinner a couple of months ago at a restaurant.

01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:18.380
We never saw a person, but a robot delivered the meal to our table.

01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:21.380
Those are the jobs of the future.

01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:24.380
The people behind the scenes that are running the robot.

01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:32.380
So I believe performance expectations and performance assessment are really the only way we're going to be able to move this ball down the field.

01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:35.380
So thank you so much. I appreciate you letting me be here.

01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:41.380
Hopefully my accent wasn't too bad and you were able to understand most of what I said.

01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:42.380
Thank you so much, Steve.

01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:47.380
Let's take just a minute to see if there are any clarifying questions for Steve before we go to our last speaker.

01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:53.380
And I hope we'll have everybody pop back up on the screen so we can get into more discussion as well.

01:36:53.380 --> 01:36:58.380
Any clarifying questions for Steve?

01:36:58.380 --> 01:37:03.380
Well, I have one, but I'm going to let you go first, Kim.

01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:17.380
Thank you. I just wanted to return to one of the examples that you gave of the AP computer science course and how that was evaluated, which is really fascinating.

01:37:17.380 --> 01:37:27.380
And how what I guess what you can share about how that assessment is done collaboratively for work in groups.

01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:36.380
I think there was a portion of that that was individually individual submissions and video submissions, but the code needed to be developed together.

01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:55.380
And as we were just talking about sort of future skills of the future student body and workforce around having both critical thinking skills, collaboration skills, communication skills and how how they functionally did that practically.

01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:59.380
So, you know, it was a pretty fascinating thing to watch.

01:37:59.380 --> 01:38:08.380
It was not handled the way we have traditionally done group work in classrooms where we say, OK, we got this group of four.

01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:13.380
Here's your task. Turn it in in an hour or in a week.

01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:29.380
And it was a lot more deliberate where there were very specific assignments given to each of the students where they actually were held accountable, I guess you could say, for their particular part in the group.

01:38:29.380 --> 01:38:32.380
And, you know, nobody could be a reporter.

01:38:32.380 --> 01:38:37.380
Nobody could be. I mean, there were actual aspects of how this was coded.

01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:51.380
So, you know, an example, for instance, that I remember is one of one group was working on erosion control because we tended to use a lot of earth science in our AP computer science.

01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:57.380
And there were different aspects of developing the computer model that different students were responsible for.

01:38:57.380 --> 01:39:09.380
So, you know, one student might have been responsible for really understanding and developing the code to show how, you know, water versus ice affects how soil is moved.

01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:19.380
Another student was really involved in the consistency and makeup of soil in different parts of Kentucky.

01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:31.380
So, you know, whether this was something that was happening in Eastern Kentucky and coal mine country versus, you know, in the runoff in Louisville.

01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:46.380
So there were very specific tasks assigned to these kids that may have resulted in a total cumulative collaboration, but they were things that could be very clearly attributed to a student as part of the overall goal.

01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:51.380
And I would just say kudos to pointing that out with regard to the collaborations.

01:39:51.380 --> 01:40:00.380
We know that that's what industry is asking for is the ability for students to be able to collaborate and work in teams.

01:40:00.380 --> 01:40:09.380
It's whether you call it 21st century skills or we call them workforce skills that are necessary.

01:40:09.380 --> 01:40:20.380
So I actually I think doing this doing the way the college board did, but also the way we are talking about performance assessment actually brings those durable skills.

01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:25.380
We also tend to call that durable skills because they should last over a lifetime.

01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:33.380
It's how those durable skills really can be seen versus just talked about.

01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:42.380
Get there. You got to develop them. That's right. Question. And then I see that something has a question.

01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:50.380
Thank you, Stephen. On slide 10, you talked about the 3D performance where we talk about practices, core ideas and cross cutting concepts.

01:40:50.380 --> 01:41:02.380
Traditionally, when we think about science assessments, we would test the life science separately from Earth and space science separately from physical science.

01:41:02.380 --> 01:41:08.380
Does this new way of thinking, does that shift when we're thinking about what an assessment would look like?

01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:17.380
Because in California, we called the preferred model in middle school the integrating all of these aspects together.

01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:28.380
So our many districts are implementing the integrated model where they're also that affects teaching, learning and the curricula that's being used as well and the sequencing of that.

01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:31.380
Just if you can elaborate a little bit on that, I'd appreciate it.

01:41:31.380 --> 01:41:44.380
So I'll tell you that when the framework was being developed and when the NGSS was being developed, I think one of the wishes was that it would make a shift.

01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:54.380
We are still kind of living under the committee of 10 from 1873 who made the decision that in the U.S. we're going to teach these things separately.

01:41:54.380 --> 01:42:00.380
And the reality is what you kind of do is you you really set up a black box of learning.

01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:06.380
So, you know, the biology teacher is going to teach about ATP and about energy in the cell.

01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:14.380
But the problem is to understand that you actually have to understand the chemistry of how phosphorus actually attaches to the ATP.

01:42:14.380 --> 01:42:20.380
And if you really want to understand that, you've got to understand the energy that happens in physics.

01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:37.380
And so it really is a whole other type of deal where if we really wanted to move this forward, having even if it's a modified integrated where people are starting to wreck.

01:42:37.380 --> 01:42:42.380
And that was one of the reasons that cross cutting concepts was so important because those span all those areas.

01:42:42.380 --> 01:43:00.380
But it's also the reality of, you know, we have to figure out that for our students to see science and to really make sense of it, it means we have to to expand their exposure to more of the sciences.

01:43:00.380 --> 01:43:08.380
The other aspect of that, which you are actually pointing out may not realize is those practices in cross cutting concepts.

01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:14.380
They actually become more alive when they are being looked at across different disciplines.

01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:25.380
But when we hold up one simple discipline, when biology is our only high school assessment, well, biology in and of itself doesn't make you scientifically literate.

01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:36.380
Now, given I'm a chemist, so maybe I'm a little biased, but, you know, I think it's really important that you actually understand that larger diversity of science.

01:43:36.380 --> 01:43:43.380
Because what it does is it makes you a better thinker because you see those different practices in different contexts.

01:43:43.380 --> 01:43:52.380
Thank you.

01:43:52.380 --> 01:43:55.380
Well, first, let me say thank you so much for the presentation.

01:43:55.380 --> 01:43:59.380
Extremely engaging and thank you so much for taking the time.

01:43:59.380 --> 01:44:07.380
I want to ask a question in relation to its slide thirty three, and it's the through course test process.

01:44:07.380 --> 01:44:17.380
I noticed as you were going over this in it on the slide, it does mention that this is something that would take place and impact teaching and learning at every grade level.

01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:34.380
So my so my question is how does the planning for the task facilitation look differently or does it look differently when planning for lower grades or younger children?

01:44:34.380 --> 01:44:40.380
Let's say first and second grade, kindergarten, first, second or older students.

01:44:40.380 --> 01:44:50.380
How how might that planning for task facilitation look the same and look different depending on the grade level?

01:44:50.380 --> 01:45:04.380
So it looks different. I mean, you know, there's the obvious right of, you know, a third grader learning about diversity of life is going to look very different than a tenth grader.

01:45:04.380 --> 01:45:23.380
So there's that. But the way we tried to approach it was especially in case the areas that we were able to well, and even six, eight, but really focusing in K5 how to connect the other content areas because most of our teachers were self-contained.

01:45:23.380 --> 01:45:42.380
So, you know, rather than having them feel like they're having to stop dropping tests, you know, let's let's think about how we can utilize the skills of reading the skills of math and bring those into a little bit more for representation in the task.

01:45:42.380 --> 01:45:47.380
We gave our teachers a lot of latitude in this because this was and this was early.

01:45:47.380 --> 01:45:53.380
I mean, this was back in 2015 when we started this this kind of journey.

01:45:53.380 --> 01:46:08.380
And what it really did for us then is it kind of in some ways it confined us because we our teachers were scared because we were actually saying you've got to do three of these tasks at every grade.

01:46:08.380 --> 01:46:22.380
And of course, you know, as you can imagine, we had some elementary schools that were like, I'm not sure if we even do science in elementary, which, you know, freaked them out because my role was when I came to visit your school, you had to take me to a non-tested science class.

01:46:22.380 --> 01:46:32.380
But we did have to be a little bit more deliberate in K-5 about showing how those other aspects of the students learning fit.

01:46:32.380 --> 01:46:44.380
Now, we made sure to have the meta tags in middle school and high school to reading math and where possible other parts of our curriculum or other parts of our standards.

01:46:44.380 --> 01:47:01.380
But I would say in K-5 a pretty big push was recognizing the self-containment of an elementary classroom and how to not look at it as a barrier, but actually how to look at it as an opportunity.

01:47:01.380 --> 01:47:10.380
Linda, I can see you're saying something, but I can't hear you.

01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:19.380
I think I turned my microphone off instead of on. I just said thank you so much. And we hope you have the time to maybe hang on a little longer.

01:47:19.380 --> 01:47:23.380
But if you have to run, it's OK.

01:47:23.380 --> 01:47:32.380
Unfortunately, I am so sorry I have to, but I am on my legislative visit and I have a group of legislators waiting for me for dinner.

01:47:32.380 --> 01:47:37.380
And so, you know, you know, you don't tell them no.

01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:43.380
I actually have to get to dinner, but thank you so much for letting me be a part. And I'm always happy to help California anytime I can.

01:47:43.380 --> 01:47:45.380
All right. Take care.

01:47:45.380 --> 01:47:50.380
Thank you.

01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:58.380
And now we have the wonderful Deb Sigmund to help us think about teacher scoring.

01:47:58.380 --> 01:48:00.380
Yes. Thank you, Linda.

01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:08.380
Waiting for my PowerPoint.

01:48:08.380 --> 01:48:10.380
There we go. OK.

01:48:10.380 --> 01:48:12.380
Boy, those were just great.

01:48:12.380 --> 01:48:19.380
And I, too, am going to try to move this along because we are trying to get back on schedule.

01:48:19.380 --> 01:48:27.380
I want to talk about, and it's something that both Lillian and Stephen kind of talked about, and that's this professional learning aspect.

01:48:27.380 --> 01:48:36.380
It is so important if we're going to have these new and innovative assessments and assessments that we really want to impact teaching and learning.

01:48:36.380 --> 01:48:42.380
It is really incumbent upon us to make sure that our teachers are part of that process, right?

01:48:42.380 --> 01:48:49.380
And that they have opportunities and time to develop their own skills.

01:48:49.380 --> 01:48:55.380
So I'm going to focus on a project that I had the good fortune to be a part of.

01:48:55.380 --> 01:49:04.380
And that's the affectionately known as the Beale Project, the Building Educator Assessment Literacy Project.

01:49:05.380 --> 01:49:11.380
Just a reminder, and maybe you don't need reminding, but this is our California Education Code.

01:49:11.380 --> 01:49:14.380
This went into effect in January of 2014.

01:49:14.380 --> 01:49:16.380
It actually was still here.

01:49:16.380 --> 01:49:21.380
We worked really hard to make sure that this got into the law.

01:49:21.380 --> 01:49:32.380
And that was that its primary purpose for these assessments were to assist teachers, administrators, pupils, and their parents

01:49:32.380 --> 01:49:42.380
in improving teaching and learning and promoting high quality teaching and learning using a variety of assessment approaches and item types.

01:49:42.380 --> 01:49:49.380
It was really important to get that in because we were totally changing the way we thought about assessment.

01:49:49.380 --> 01:49:51.380
So that's there.

01:49:51.380 --> 01:50:00.380
We have full support of the law behind our development of these new and innovative kinds of items.

01:50:00.380 --> 01:50:03.380
You know, I think about why do we assess, right?

01:50:03.380 --> 01:50:07.380
And certainly the speakers talked about different reasons.

01:50:07.380 --> 01:50:15.380
But from a state perspective, you know, and from a school perspective, thinking about a way forward, right?

01:50:15.380 --> 01:50:21.380
It doesn't tell you what to do, but it may point you in a particular direction.

01:50:21.380 --> 01:50:28.380
Hopefully making informed decisions, right, if we use that data appropriately and correctly.

01:50:28.380 --> 01:50:30.380
Triangulating the information.

01:50:30.380 --> 01:50:41.380
California uses lots of different data sources to make decisions, classroom decisions, school-based decisions, thinking about accountability decisions.

01:50:41.380 --> 01:50:45.380
Making those informed instructional decisions.

01:50:45.380 --> 01:50:52.380
And then finally, policy and programmatic decisions, which sit squarely into your responsibility.

01:50:52.380 --> 01:50:56.380
And each of those really is a different audience, right?

01:50:56.380 --> 01:51:03.380
So those different audiences think about assessment differently.

01:51:03.380 --> 01:51:14.380
So this building educator assessment literacy was really about engaging teachers, educators, through professional development,

01:51:14.380 --> 01:51:20.380
focused on the understanding of and using performance tasks.

01:51:20.380 --> 01:51:30.380
It was, it started back in, let me give you the, let me talk about what smarter balance performance tasks are first.

01:51:30.380 --> 01:51:39.380
So this, I just want to remind folks, this is kind of the context within which we were developing this professional learning.

01:51:39.380 --> 01:51:42.380
And that was really devoted around the smarter balance, right?

01:51:42.380 --> 01:51:48.380
We were moving from a totally multiple choice, selected response kind of test.

01:51:48.380 --> 01:51:54.380
And we knew we were going to have to train our teachers, give them information, include them in the process,

01:51:54.380 --> 01:51:59.380
so that they could effectively bring our kids along with us.

01:51:59.380 --> 01:52:03.380
So in the smarter balance context, what are performance tasks?

01:52:03.380 --> 01:52:11.380
Well, they're collections of questions or activities, and they lead to a culminating performance, right?

01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:14.380
They're not quite as long as the one that Lillian talked about.

01:52:14.380 --> 01:52:22.380
I think the eight step process are meant to measure those capacities, such a depth of understanding,

01:52:22.380 --> 01:52:24.380
you know, really hitting those critical thinking skills.

01:52:24.380 --> 01:52:26.380
That's what we were focused on.

01:52:26.380 --> 01:52:33.380
We wanted people to think more deeply about what we were asking of our students and what they could demonstrate.

01:52:33.380 --> 01:52:38.380
So measure a student's ability to demonstrate critical thinking and problem solving.

01:52:38.380 --> 01:52:45.380
And then challenging students to apply their knowledge and skills to go to look at those real world complex problems,

01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:49.380
which is exactly what Steve was talking about, right, those durable skills.

01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:54.380
That's what these are about, right?

01:52:54.380 --> 01:52:56.380
So how did it begin?

01:52:56.380 --> 01:53:02.380
It was a partnership between WestEd and Scale, for those of you who don't know,

01:53:02.380 --> 01:53:05.380
Scale, Stanford Center for Assessment Learning and Equity.

01:53:05.380 --> 01:53:12.380
And I'll never forget, I was deputy superintendent at the department, and I got a call from Dr. Darling Hammond,

01:53:12.380 --> 01:53:19.380
and she said, Deb, do you think the state would be willing to help us with this project?

01:53:19.380 --> 01:53:23.380
And I said, I think so.

01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:25.380
I think it would be just great.

01:53:25.380 --> 01:53:31.380
And so the state of California was brought into this really incredible piece of work

01:53:31.380 --> 01:53:36.380
that had generous funding from Hewlett and Bechtel and the Stuart Foundation.

01:53:36.380 --> 01:53:38.380
And we had partner states, so it wasn't just California.

01:53:38.380 --> 01:53:41.380
We had California, New Hampshire, and Oregon.

01:53:41.380 --> 01:53:46.380
But we certainly had a lot of work going on in California.

01:53:46.380 --> 01:53:51.380
And remember, it was so important for the state to bring teachers on board.

01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:56.380
We were totally changing the way we were talking about assessment.

01:53:56.380 --> 01:54:00.380
And we knew at the time, if we didn't bring our teachers on board,

01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:03.380
we'd really suffer the consequences.

01:54:03.380 --> 01:54:06.380
And not only would our students not be successful,

01:54:06.380 --> 01:54:10.380
but our teachers would be extraordinarily challenged.

01:54:10.380 --> 01:54:15.380
So we wanted to make sure that they had the tools that they needed.

01:54:15.380 --> 01:54:21.380
So the goals of the project were to build the knowledge of the standards,

01:54:21.380 --> 01:54:25.380
because this was back, Common Core was still relatively new,

01:54:25.380 --> 01:54:30.380
and these new kinds of assessments, so to build that knowledge.

01:54:30.380 --> 01:54:33.380
And to come to kind of a common understanding and a common language

01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:36.380
about how we would talk about these assessments.

01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:41.380
Strengthen teacher understanding of the instructional shifts, right?

01:54:41.380 --> 01:54:46.380
Because there were definite shifts when we moved to Common Core.

01:54:46.380 --> 01:54:51.380
And the ways of college and career readiness, how those could be assessed.

01:54:51.380 --> 01:54:53.380
It was very different.

01:54:53.380 --> 01:55:00.380
And then, probably most importantly, supporting educators in their examination

01:55:00.380 --> 01:55:05.380
of student work, particularly performance tasks.

01:55:05.380 --> 01:55:12.380
And not only examination, but really thinking about what that student work meant.

01:55:12.380 --> 01:55:18.380
I can't tell you, and those of you who maybe participated in some of these trainings,

01:55:18.380 --> 01:55:25.380
truly transformational in terms of how teachers looked at student work.

01:55:25.380 --> 01:55:30.380
It was really wonderful to look at.

01:55:30.380 --> 01:55:33.380
And then here were our independent learning objectives.

01:55:33.380 --> 01:55:38.380
So we expected teachers, educators, to learn about performance assessments,

01:55:38.380 --> 01:55:42.380
what kind of evidence you were looking for,

01:55:42.380 --> 01:55:45.380
how they provided evidence of student learning.

01:55:45.380 --> 01:55:48.380
Collaboratively score student work.

01:55:48.380 --> 01:55:53.380
So it was about not only this teacher learning,

01:55:53.380 --> 01:55:58.380
but they really were getting a common sense of what those expectations were, right?

01:55:58.380 --> 01:56:03.380
Making it really transparent about what it meant for a student

01:56:03.380 --> 01:56:08.380
to actually be proficient, if you will, on those standards.

01:56:08.380 --> 01:56:13.380
And then reviewing student work as a basis for reflecting on

01:56:13.380 --> 01:56:17.380
and responding to the evidence of learning that performance tasks can generate.

01:56:17.380 --> 01:56:19.380
So it was brand new.

01:56:19.380 --> 01:56:23.380
We really were hopeful that people would engage with us.

01:56:23.380 --> 01:56:26.380
And fortunately, that absolutely happened.

01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:28.380
So what were the benefits of this?

01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:29.380
There were many.

01:56:29.380 --> 01:56:31.380
Here are a few.

01:56:31.380 --> 01:56:36.380
But understanding those assessment literacy concepts sounds simple enough.

01:56:36.380 --> 01:56:41.380
But having a common understanding and a common way to talk about this

01:56:41.380 --> 01:56:47.380
was really important as we embarked on this new set of assessments and standards.

01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:51.380
Really talking about what does it mean to design a performance assessment?

01:56:51.380 --> 01:56:52.380
How is that different?

01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:53.380
What does it look like?

01:56:53.380 --> 01:56:55.380
How can it be used in a classroom?

01:56:55.380 --> 01:57:00.380
How can it be used to talk about those instructional shifts?

01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:06.380
Also talked about the claims and targets, which are part of a smarter system.

01:57:06.380 --> 01:57:09.380
Really talking about what are the demands for students?

01:57:09.380 --> 01:57:12.380
What are we asking students to do?

01:57:12.380 --> 01:57:18.380
And how is that different from a selected response test?

01:57:18.380 --> 01:57:25.380
Certainly, the calibration of student scoring using state-level rubrics.

01:57:25.380 --> 01:57:28.380
Remember, Rodriguez, you talked about those protocols, right?

01:57:28.380 --> 01:57:30.380
But rubrics are kind of protocols, right?

01:57:30.380 --> 01:57:38.380
So really engaging in the rubrics and thinking about what those rubrics are asking our students to do

01:57:38.380 --> 01:57:41.380
was very enlightening for our teachers as well.

01:57:41.380 --> 01:57:45.380
And then reflection on the instructional implications

01:57:45.380 --> 01:57:49.380
that these tasks have for teaching and learning.

01:57:49.380 --> 01:57:53.380
So as these teachers are engaging in this professional learning opportunity,

01:57:53.380 --> 01:57:58.380
they're thinking about not only about the student work,

01:57:58.380 --> 01:58:02.380
but how does that impact what I do as a teacher?

01:58:02.380 --> 01:58:06.380
How can I do something differently perhaps

01:58:06.380 --> 01:58:13.380
to ensure that my students are able to demonstrate what they know and can do?

01:58:13.380 --> 01:58:17.380
This is very reciprocal in nature, right?

01:58:17.380 --> 01:58:20.380
This examination of student work.

01:58:20.380 --> 01:58:31.380
So it's impactful to both the teacher and the learner, right?

01:58:31.380 --> 01:58:37.380
So we did many, many workshops throughout California in particular,

01:58:37.380 --> 01:58:39.380
probably more than other states.

01:58:39.380 --> 01:58:42.380
But we would always survey our respondents.

01:58:42.380 --> 01:58:47.380
And this is kind of indicative of what we always found after our workshops.

01:58:47.380 --> 01:58:53.380
I'm confident that I can provide instruction that supports students in performing well.

01:58:53.380 --> 01:58:58.380
Now, I would change that question right now if we had to do it over again.

01:58:58.380 --> 01:59:03.380
Because I think it's about encouraging students to do well

01:59:03.380 --> 01:59:06.380
in terms of what they're learning, right?

01:59:06.380 --> 01:59:10.380
It goes beyond showing us what you know and can do on an assessment.

01:59:10.380 --> 01:59:14.380
But before the training, about 70 percent, and after the training, 90 percent.

01:59:14.380 --> 01:59:17.380
And the training was about two days generally.

01:59:17.380 --> 01:59:23.380
And here are a couple of quotes that I think are pretty indicative of how folks responded.

01:59:23.380 --> 01:59:27.380
Performance tasks are a better way to authentically assess what students know

01:59:27.380 --> 01:59:33.380
about teachers, the ability to understand how they think about mathematics in context.

01:59:33.380 --> 01:59:40.380
Again, that reciprocity, this isn't just about gaining knowledge about what our kids can do.

01:59:40.380 --> 01:59:45.380
This is helping teachers do a better job, right?

01:59:45.380 --> 01:59:49.380
I think that I'm less worried about the testing and it's less of a mystery.

01:59:49.380 --> 01:59:52.380
So I'll not project my fears on my students.

01:59:52.380 --> 01:59:54.380
We talked about transparency here, right?

01:59:54.380 --> 01:59:57.380
Making sure that families know, making sure that students know.

01:59:57.380 --> 02:00:02.380
This is certainly helpful in that.

02:00:02.380 --> 02:00:05.380
I believe that I can prepare my students and they can be successful.

02:00:05.380 --> 02:00:13.380
Because remember, it was kind of a mystery as we started down this journey back in 2014.

02:00:13.380 --> 02:00:20.380
And then finally, all K-12 teachers would benefit from experiencing the training.

02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:25.380
It underscores how content standards have to be taught and assessed along the learning progression,

02:00:25.380 --> 02:00:31.380
informs what students need to be able to know and how to demonstrate what they know.

02:00:31.380 --> 02:00:36.380
So as with any good grant, you want it to move forward, right?

02:00:36.380 --> 02:00:42.380
So we didn't just stop, nor did the California Department of Education.

02:00:42.380 --> 02:00:46.380
So there, nor did lots of county offices of education.

02:00:46.380 --> 02:00:53.380
So the grant's purpose was to really train a lot of trainers and get as many people trained as possible.

02:00:53.380 --> 02:01:00.380
And what happened, though, was people kind of really liked it.

02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:10.380
So you'll see in California, there was this initial cadre of trainers in 2014, 113 people.

02:01:10.380 --> 02:01:20.380
And for California at LACO, the L.A. County Office of Education had a particular strong interest.

02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:25.380
And they had 265 folks, and then we had 57.

02:01:25.380 --> 02:01:31.380
But over the course of the next few years, we've trained over 7,000 in California,

02:01:31.380 --> 02:01:37.380
680 Oregon, 200 New Hampshire, 315 in Hawaii.

02:01:37.380 --> 02:01:44.380
I have to say that this is a professional learning opportunity that the state of California has used

02:01:44.380 --> 02:01:52.380
and is promoting through their professional learning that they offer through their contractor.

02:01:52.380 --> 02:01:57.380
So it is offered, or some rendition, some version of it, if you will,

02:01:57.380 --> 02:02:05.380
but basically the examination of student work, the calibration of that, the review of state-level rubrics, and so forth.

02:02:05.380 --> 02:02:16.380
So you have CASP trainings, LPAC trainings, CASP trainings, and then Oregon, Nevada, and Hawaii have taken it on and moved it forward.

02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:23.380
As I said, this L.A. County Office of Education project called the Performance Task Development Project,

02:02:23.380 --> 02:02:30.380
they have a bank, if you will, of performance tasks in math and science that they have their teachers write

02:02:30.380 --> 02:02:33.380
and then have their teachers score.

02:02:33.380 --> 02:02:43.380
And then finally, there's an online course that actually we created, and that is being currently used in Santa Ana Unified.

02:02:43.380 --> 02:02:46.380
And here's a quote from Santa Ana.

02:02:46.380 --> 02:02:51.380
I found the course was valuable, painted a clear picture of what is expected,

02:02:51.380 --> 02:02:58.380
what we should be working on with our students, and provides good examples and resources for teachers to implement in their classrooms.

02:02:58.380 --> 02:03:00.380
Again, it's a recurring theme.

02:03:00.380 --> 02:03:02.380
Everybody wants to know the information.

02:03:02.380 --> 02:03:05.380
We cannot leave teachers out of the equation.

02:03:05.380 --> 02:03:12.380
And we have to give them the tools to make sure that they can get into the classroom and teach their students.

02:03:12.380 --> 02:03:17.380
And then finally, this is a teacher.

02:03:17.380 --> 02:03:20.380
She's actually now an assistant superintendent in Evergreen.

02:03:20.380 --> 02:03:22.380
She was one of our trainers.

02:03:22.380 --> 02:03:25.380
I just want to let her speak.

02:03:31.380 --> 02:03:34.380
Having the time to look at the work sort of independently,

02:03:34.380 --> 02:03:41.380
so that that work isn't quite so laborious when you come together, but hugely impactful.

02:03:41.380 --> 02:03:44.380
And I think that really needs to be the focus of PLC groups,

02:03:44.380 --> 02:03:47.380
is teachers need to be able to come together to talk about student work

02:03:47.380 --> 02:03:54.380
and come to consensus on what they agree in terms of how a certain task might be scored.

02:03:54.380 --> 02:03:58.380
You know, going through the performance task and having this experience is really powerful,

02:03:58.380 --> 02:04:04.380
and being able to look at student work and then thinking about the instructional implications that come from that.

02:04:04.380 --> 02:04:10.380
That's the power of where we're headed, I think, in the next several years as far as teaching goes.

02:04:10.380 --> 02:04:14.380
We've realized that teachers don't teach curriculum, they teach students.

02:04:14.380 --> 02:04:19.380
And this performance task project really respects them in that way,

02:04:19.380 --> 02:04:24.380
because it's not taking a program and teaching from it, turning page by page,

02:04:24.380 --> 02:04:29.380
but it's empowering teachers to know how they can best support their students and their growth

02:04:29.380 --> 02:04:33.380
and learning together within the system.

02:04:35.380 --> 02:04:37.380
I couldn't have said it better.

02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:42.380
And again, if you think back to what we were charged with in terms of the law,

02:04:42.380 --> 02:04:48.380
that's what that teacher just expressed, that this really helps her support teaching and learning.

02:04:48.380 --> 02:04:52.380
This is for future, but here are a couple of three websites

02:04:52.380 --> 02:04:57.380
that really focus on performance tasks and hand scoring and so forth.

02:04:57.380 --> 02:05:02.380
The department's put up an asynchronous hand scoring module that is available to all districts.

02:05:02.380 --> 02:05:10.380
We have an understanding proficiency website, and there's a brief about how performance tasks are working in Oregon.

02:05:10.380 --> 02:05:16.380
And if anyone needs information, there you go.

02:05:16.380 --> 02:05:21.380
And with that, I will hand it back to Dr. Darlene Hammond.

02:05:21.380 --> 02:05:25.380
Well, thank you. And let's see if there's some questions for Deb.

02:05:25.380 --> 02:05:32.380
Let me just note that because of this practice, we actually required in our contract with ETS

02:05:32.380 --> 02:05:36.380
that California teachers score the performance tasks.

02:05:36.380 --> 02:05:43.380
But we have not gotten to a place where we have a systematic way to ensure that all teachers get that kind of experience.

02:05:43.380 --> 02:05:49.380
So, you know, we got down that path and saw the value and do engage with that.

02:05:49.380 --> 02:05:55.380
Other questions for Deb?

02:05:55.380 --> 02:06:00.380
All right. I guess I think probably people are a little bit maxed out at this point.

02:06:00.380 --> 02:06:06.380
And so I think what we'll do is take a break, take about 10 minutes and come back.

02:06:06.380 --> 02:06:18.380
And then we have work to do. See you at 315.

02:06:18.380 --> 02:06:35.380
Encouraging everyone to find a seat. Thank you.

02:06:35.380 --> 02:06:38.380
All right.

02:06:38.380 --> 02:06:44.380
So that was a lot to take in and we want to do some processing of all of that information,

02:06:44.380 --> 02:06:50.380
some thinking about what we heard and what we resonated with, et cetera.

02:06:50.380 --> 02:06:56.380
I did want to just point out that there's a lot and you sort of heard references.

02:06:56.380 --> 02:07:04.380
There's a lot of activity in California already, but we have not like pulled it together into a system, so to speak.

02:07:04.380 --> 02:07:12.380
So you heard Steve Pruitt talk about L.A. County Office of Education and San Diego County Office of Education,

02:07:12.380 --> 02:07:18.380
which have Performance Task Bank and Math and Science and work in San Francisco.

02:07:18.380 --> 02:07:22.380
Also around that, there's an NGSS collaborative that's been doing that work.

02:07:22.380 --> 02:07:28.380
When Deb was at Weston, she was facilitating some of the work of those collaboratives.

02:07:28.380 --> 02:07:33.380
We have teachers involved in scoring performance assessments on Smarter Balanced.

02:07:33.380 --> 02:07:40.380
Again, we don't have a system where everybody gets that experience, but we have opportunities and we've learned from those.

02:07:40.380 --> 02:07:47.380
So one of the things for us as we're looking forward is both to get clear about what we think are some important features

02:07:47.380 --> 02:07:52.380
of the system we'd like to have and then to get clear about how to make it more systematic

02:07:52.380 --> 02:07:57.380
and how to pull that together in the next coming years.

02:07:57.380 --> 02:08:04.380
So with that, are there any other questions that people want to ask now that were about the content that we just heard

02:08:04.380 --> 02:08:11.380
before we get into our next activity that Deb's going to lead us in? Yeah.

02:08:11.380 --> 02:08:22.380
In what we heard, partly based on who presented, but then also in what we read,

02:08:22.380 --> 02:08:28.380
it seems like there's a lot of innovative work happening in science right now.

02:08:28.380 --> 02:08:38.380
Is that just anecdotal to what we've read or is that where there's a lot of the most innovative stuff happening?

02:08:38.380 --> 02:08:44.380
I think one reason there's a lot of innovation happening in science is that, number one,

02:08:44.380 --> 02:08:49.380
it was not part of the accountability system that had federal rules attached to it early on,

02:08:49.380 --> 02:08:58.380
that it has a federal requirement for once in a great span, but there aren't as many other trappings.

02:08:58.380 --> 02:09:03.380
And people got started on science later with NGSS.

02:09:03.380 --> 02:09:08.380
And NGSS is very clear about its expectations for performance.

02:09:08.380 --> 02:09:12.380
So for all those reasons, it is a place where a lot of people are innovating,

02:09:12.380 --> 02:09:16.380
but also there's a lot of interest in coming back around on English language arts and math.

02:09:16.380 --> 02:09:22.380
And there are projects, for example, in Louisiana and some other states where they're trying to do curriculum

02:09:22.380 --> 02:09:30.380
embedded tasks in English language arts and math that are linked to certain kinds of curriculum that they use.

02:09:30.380 --> 02:09:37.380
And there are people who are talking about resonating the, what's the word I'm looking for,

02:09:37.380 --> 02:09:45.380
bringing back the writing portfolios that used to be used in Kentucky and Vermont

02:09:45.380 --> 02:09:50.380
where there were a few standardized tasks that kids had to do, like an essay,

02:09:50.380 --> 02:09:54.380
but they could choose their topic and they could embed it in their experience.

02:09:54.380 --> 02:09:58.380
And then there were rubrics to score and they could use that as part of the assessment.

02:09:58.380 --> 02:10:01.380
So those things are being talked about.

02:10:01.380 --> 02:10:09.380
But there is probably more collaborative state activity in science at the moment.

02:10:09.380 --> 02:10:14.380
Any other questions?

02:10:14.380 --> 02:10:19.380
So maybe we'll move ahead, Deb, with our sort of our next processing.

02:10:19.380 --> 02:10:23.380
I'll bring my facilitator hat back on.

02:10:23.380 --> 02:10:25.380
So we've heard a lot today.

02:10:25.380 --> 02:10:31.380
And we want you to have a discussion at your table.

02:10:31.380 --> 02:10:37.380
This is kind of our, I think we've got, hmm, is it just our time?

02:10:37.380 --> 02:10:38.380
What would you like?

02:10:38.380 --> 02:10:40.380
Till about 345?

02:10:40.380 --> 02:10:44.380
We just said there will be not a half an hour of public comment.

02:10:44.380 --> 02:10:45.380
Okay.

02:10:45.380 --> 02:10:48.380
And that we could go another half an hour on this activity.

02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:51.380
345 for discussion at table?

02:10:51.380 --> 02:10:52.380
Yeah.

02:10:52.380 --> 02:10:53.380
Okay.

02:10:53.380 --> 02:10:54.380
All right.

02:10:54.380 --> 02:10:56.380
So you have your question at the table.

02:10:56.380 --> 02:10:58.380
It's activity two.

02:10:58.380 --> 02:11:02.380
And just let me read it for the public.

02:11:02.380 --> 02:11:06.380
Thinking about everything you've heard today, thinking about where we started,

02:11:06.380 --> 02:11:09.380
which was what do you like about our current system?

02:11:09.380 --> 02:11:11.380
What do you think, how could we make it better?

02:11:11.380 --> 02:11:13.380
What are your aspirations?

02:11:13.380 --> 02:11:16.380
You heard the three presentations.

02:11:16.380 --> 02:11:22.380
What characteristics of the assessment systems and the innovations that you heard

02:11:22.380 --> 02:11:27.380
about today do you think might be worth consideration for California's

02:11:27.380 --> 02:11:30.380
assessment system?

02:11:30.380 --> 02:11:33.380
So think big.

02:11:33.380 --> 02:11:36.380
And we'd like you to do this at your table.

02:11:36.380 --> 02:11:42.380
There will be report outs at the end of the time.

02:11:42.380 --> 02:11:43.380
Okay?

02:11:43.380 --> 02:11:44.380
All right.

02:11:44.380 --> 02:11:47.380
Yeah.

02:11:47.380 --> 02:11:48.380
All right.

02:12:14.380 --> 02:12:15.380
Thank you.

02:12:44.380 --> 02:12:46.380
Thank you.

02:13:14.380 --> 02:13:16.380
Thank you.

02:13:44.380 --> 02:13:45.380
Thank you.

02:14:14.380 --> 02:14:16.380
Thank you.

02:14:44.380 --> 02:14:46.380
Thank you.

02:15:14.380 --> 02:15:16.380
Thank you.

02:15:44.380 --> 02:15:45.380
Thank you.

02:16:14.380 --> 02:16:16.380
Thank you.

02:16:44.380 --> 02:16:46.380
Thank you.

02:17:14.380 --> 02:17:16.380
Thank you.

02:17:44.380 --> 02:17:45.380
Thank you.

02:18:14.380 --> 02:18:16.380
Thank you.

02:18:44.380 --> 02:18:46.380
Thank you.

02:19:14.380 --> 02:19:15.380
Thank you.

02:19:44.380 --> 02:19:46.380
Thank you.

02:20:14.380 --> 02:20:16.380
Thank you.

02:20:44.380 --> 02:20:45.380
Thank you.

02:21:14.380 --> 02:21:15.380
Thank you.

02:21:44.380 --> 02:21:45.380
Thank you.

02:22:14.380 --> 02:22:15.380
Thank you.

02:22:44.380 --> 02:22:45.380
Thank you.

02:23:14.380 --> 02:23:15.380
Thank you.

02:23:44.380 --> 02:23:45.380
Thank you.

02:24:14.380 --> 02:24:15.380
Thank you.

02:24:44.380 --> 02:24:45.380
Thank you.

02:25:14.380 --> 02:25:15.380
Thank you.

02:25:44.380 --> 02:25:45.380
Thank you.

02:26:14.380 --> 02:26:15.380
Thank you.

02:26:44.380 --> 02:26:45.380
Thank you.

02:27:14.380 --> 02:27:15.380
Thank you.

02:27:44.380 --> 02:27:45.380
Thank you.

02:28:14.380 --> 02:28:15.380
Thank you.

02:28:44.380 --> 02:28:45.380
Thank you.

02:29:14.380 --> 02:29:15.380
Thank you.

02:29:44.380 --> 02:29:45.380
Thank you.

02:30:14.380 --> 02:30:15.380
Thank you.

02:30:44.380 --> 02:30:45.380
Thank you.

02:31:14.380 --> 02:31:15.380
Thank you.

02:31:44.380 --> 02:31:45.380
Thank you.

02:32:15.380 --> 02:32:18.380
We ready?

02:32:18.380 --> 02:32:21.380
Okay.

02:32:21.380 --> 02:32:26.380
All right.

02:32:26.380 --> 02:32:27.380
Thank you all.

02:32:27.380 --> 02:32:32.380
It sounded like there were some really great discussions going on.

02:32:32.380 --> 02:32:36.380
And I'm going to ask you all to report out.

02:32:36.380 --> 02:32:39.380
And we are starting with this table back here.

02:32:39.380 --> 02:32:43.380
And member Escobedo, if you would do the report out.

02:32:43.380 --> 02:32:44.380
Sure.

02:32:44.380 --> 02:32:47.380
There are four specific areas.

02:32:47.380 --> 02:32:48.380
Number one.

02:32:48.380 --> 02:32:49.380
Do you want a microphone?

02:32:49.380 --> 02:32:50.380
Oh.

02:32:50.380 --> 02:32:51.380
Yes.

02:32:51.380 --> 02:32:52.380
Yes.

02:32:52.380 --> 02:33:04.380
Well, first, we were really enthralled with the statewide test bank system.

02:33:04.380 --> 02:33:10.380
But we believe that it should be perhaps on a statewide basis created,

02:33:10.380 --> 02:33:15.380
but then have local input from districts,

02:33:15.380 --> 02:33:24.380
local teachers to really help inform on how to expand perhaps this test bank.

02:33:24.380 --> 02:33:32.380
And this test bank should have delineated tasks that will help teachers with lesson design.

02:33:32.380 --> 02:33:35.380
That was one.

02:33:35.380 --> 02:33:37.380
Second one, similar to the Beale project,

02:33:37.380 --> 02:33:46.380
is to have some type of master trainer model that perhaps can be disseminated by the county offices to teachers,

02:33:46.380 --> 02:33:51.380
to help other teachers understand how to create assessments,

02:33:51.380 --> 02:34:02.380
but also to have a specific focused protocols to help districts with establishing well-informed,

02:34:02.380 --> 02:34:06.380
well-structured PLC models.

02:34:06.380 --> 02:34:07.380
Great idea.

02:34:07.380 --> 02:34:17.380
And to somehow adhere to some type of design so that teachers have time to collaborate.

02:34:17.380 --> 02:34:21.380
Very, very critical.

02:34:21.380 --> 02:34:32.380
Also, we believe that having a portfolio for students to have delineated capstone projects,

02:34:32.380 --> 02:34:40.380
granting students choice to select a project of their own interest and passion,

02:34:40.380 --> 02:34:52.380
is really critical, to have a component where students can really have that choice of what they want to pursue and investigate and analyze.

02:34:52.380 --> 02:35:01.380
And finally is to investigate, we're very intrigued with the collaboration project, right?

02:35:01.380 --> 02:35:03.380
Because when you think about the world of work,

02:35:03.380 --> 02:35:11.380
very rarely do you have jobs where you have a singular person trying to resolve a problem, right?

02:35:11.380 --> 02:35:14.380
So if there's some way we can construct and assess one,

02:35:14.380 --> 02:35:26.380
where students can work in collaborative groups and work together to solve an issue or problem that's connected to their environment.

02:35:26.380 --> 02:35:27.380
Great idea.

02:35:27.380 --> 02:35:30.380
Anything else that I missed?

02:35:30.380 --> 02:35:35.380
I'm struck by how you're trying to get to your aspirational ideas through this, too.

02:35:35.380 --> 02:35:38.380
It's definitely coming forward.

02:35:38.380 --> 02:35:39.380
Thank you so much.

02:35:39.380 --> 02:35:42.380
Any other comments from that table?

02:35:42.380 --> 02:35:43.380
Okay.

02:35:43.380 --> 02:35:44.380
All right.

02:35:44.380 --> 02:35:49.380
Next, Member Glover-Woods, I believe you are reporting out.

02:35:49.380 --> 02:35:50.380
Yes, I am.

02:35:50.380 --> 02:35:57.380
And I would like to say I believe that Francisco's table was probably ear-hustling to our table.

02:35:57.380 --> 02:36:02.380
I just want to put that out there.

02:36:02.380 --> 02:36:09.380
Our thoughts on this question were very similar to what was just shared.

02:36:09.380 --> 02:36:13.380
So there are four points I'll lift up for our conversation.

02:36:13.380 --> 02:36:20.380
One is how we can have our assessments, particularly those performance-based tasks,

02:36:20.380 --> 02:36:29.380
reflect that interdisciplinary integration and to kind of link to Dr. Pruitt's idea of reporting and messaging.

02:36:29.380 --> 02:36:38.380
How do we message that in such a way so that teachers feel that that is what they should do?

02:36:38.380 --> 02:36:41.380
And that is something that would be helpful to them.

02:36:42.380 --> 02:36:50.380
We don't want to say one thing but then advocate for something different that causes confusion and chaos.

02:36:50.380 --> 02:36:59.380
Our second, along that idea of student collaboration, is how we can further develop the assessment

02:36:59.380 --> 02:37:06.380
to measure those critical thinking skills and engage and value the student collaboration

02:37:06.380 --> 02:37:13.380
around those performance tasks with some shared accountability for students as part of our assessment system.

02:37:13.380 --> 02:37:16.380
So we'd like to delve a little deeper into that, look at examples,

02:37:16.380 --> 02:37:21.380
see if this is something that we can definitely have embedded in the future.

02:37:21.380 --> 02:37:25.380
The third is really about relevance to students.

02:37:25.380 --> 02:37:33.380
And it speaks to particularly the example we saw, the Hawaii example we saw from our first presentation.

02:37:33.380 --> 02:37:42.380
How do we make our assessments and the performance tasks something that is extremely relevant to students in their here and now,

02:37:42.380 --> 02:37:48.380
where they are not asking, why do I have to do this, but are wanting to engage in it?

02:37:48.380 --> 02:37:57.380
And how can we ensure that the performance tasks once developed to be culturally responsive and relevant are nimble enough

02:37:57.380 --> 02:38:06.380
so that over time, if they need to be changed or adapted to continue to be relevant, we as a system are able to do so.

02:38:06.380 --> 02:38:10.380
What is relevant in 2023 may not be relevant in 2025.

02:38:10.380 --> 02:38:14.380
So how do we create a system that's nimble enough to be able to do that?

02:38:14.380 --> 02:38:21.380
And lastly, looking at review of student work, teacher review of student work,

02:38:22.380 --> 02:38:29.380
how might we be able to systematize that in such a way that we have more teachers

02:38:29.380 --> 02:38:36.380
that are engaging in review of student work and are desiring to engage in the review of student work?

02:38:36.380 --> 02:38:40.380
So not a mandate, but something that teachers see that as valuable.

02:38:40.380 --> 02:38:48.380
And how to make that practice more widespread across our state, kind of connecting to that field project presentation we had.

02:38:48.380 --> 02:38:56.380
And one part of the conversation was about how to engage the university partners in teacher preparation

02:38:56.380 --> 02:39:02.380
so that as we're talking about assessment literacy, as we're talking about not just our current system of assessment,

02:39:02.380 --> 02:39:08.380
but our future system of assessment, how do those teacher preparation programs prepare our future teachers

02:39:08.380 --> 02:39:15.380
to be able to engage in that work as we look at the professional development side for those who are already in the field?

02:39:16.380 --> 02:39:22.380
Great points. And again, I'm really seeing that cultural responsiveness

02:39:22.380 --> 02:39:29.380
and just the transparency of the assessments and so forth and love the idea about our teacher prep programs.

02:39:29.380 --> 02:39:32.380
This table, anyone else want to add?

02:39:39.380 --> 02:39:44.380
Just the idea that it's our teachers and everyone who supports teachers.

02:39:44.380 --> 02:39:49.380
So as the system, as the learning government comes back to the school site,

02:39:49.380 --> 02:39:56.380
what happens in the department meetings and the grade level meetings in an ongoing way is supported by lots of people.

02:39:56.380 --> 02:39:58.380
So including them in the learning as well.

02:40:03.380 --> 02:40:06.380
This is actually slightly off center of the question.

02:40:06.380 --> 02:40:11.380
So you did a beautiful job on the report out on that.

02:40:11.380 --> 02:40:21.380
And it's actually more thinking about maybe a common gap in all of the presenters is where are families in all of this.

02:40:21.380 --> 02:40:29.380
If we do a really knockout job on the next iteration of assessment

02:40:29.380 --> 02:40:36.380
and people still don't understand it who are not in the education sphere,

02:40:36.380 --> 02:40:40.380
we're going to still have those polling numbers that I think the first presentation started.

02:40:40.380 --> 02:40:46.380
It needs to be digestible for civilians, too.

02:40:46.380 --> 02:40:50.380
That's great. Wonderful point.

02:40:50.380 --> 02:40:56.380
All right. Anything else? Good. Okay. All right.

02:40:56.380 --> 02:41:02.380
And finally, our last table, and I believe member Olken. All right. Great.

02:41:06.380 --> 02:41:11.380
This reminds me of our recent confirmation here and going last.

02:41:11.380 --> 02:41:17.380
Everything's already been said. Yeah.

02:41:17.380 --> 02:41:28.380
So I tried to categorize on the fly the types of things that we came up with into three categories.

02:41:28.380 --> 02:41:33.380
I hope you don't mind. So the first is teachers as the key.

02:41:33.380 --> 02:41:38.380
We had a lot of comments around the importance of like what we saw, you know,

02:41:38.380 --> 02:41:50.380
whether it was the assessment literacy work or the development of performance tasks and sharing of student work and rubrics.

02:41:50.380 --> 02:42:00.380
We talked a lot about the importance of time for educators to do this work together,

02:42:00.380 --> 02:42:04.380
both at their school site and across schools.

02:42:04.380 --> 02:42:10.380
And so part of that getting back to teachers as key was thinking about the places that could happen.

02:42:10.380 --> 02:42:16.380
So teacher education, part of induction, ongoing professional development for teachers.

02:42:16.380 --> 02:42:27.380
We talked about the role of county offices and also thinking about the ways in which maybe thinking about this work regionally

02:42:27.380 --> 02:42:39.380
might be helpful so that teachers feel like it's not such a huge and distant initiative and also so the work really reflects the local community.

02:42:39.380 --> 02:42:46.380
I think those are the big things related to teachers as key.

02:42:46.380 --> 02:42:50.380
And then the second one was students and their assets.

02:42:51.380 --> 02:43:03.380
So we liked the way that we saw examples of tasks that use different modalities and ask students to explain and show what they know in different ways.

02:43:03.380 --> 02:43:11.380
Some of the what we saw there were supports built in for students who learn differently and express themselves in different ways.

02:43:11.380 --> 02:43:19.380
And so really ensuring that students can share what they know in ways that work for them and that honor their strengths.

02:43:19.380 --> 02:43:28.380
We talked a lot about the importance of the work being relevant to students.

02:43:28.380 --> 02:43:33.380
Just jump piggybacking on what we heard before, build on what they know and what they care about.

02:43:33.380 --> 02:43:42.380
And so the way that performance tasks can allow that to happen in a way that isn't possible in other types of assessment.

02:43:42.380 --> 02:43:46.380
And then the third broad category was authentic assessments.

02:43:46.380 --> 02:43:57.380
So we appreciated the assessments that were focusing on problem solving and showing learning rather than regurgitation of fact hands on learning and demonstration of mastery.

02:43:57.380 --> 02:44:03.380
And we talked a lot about assessments that are embedded into instruction rather than solely summative.

02:44:03.380 --> 02:44:08.380
And there was one more thing. Oh, this is just me because I have the microphone.

02:44:08.380 --> 02:44:12.380
There was one of the states.

02:44:12.380 --> 02:44:13.380
I think it was Kentucky.

02:44:13.380 --> 02:44:15.380
They had in this.

02:44:15.380 --> 02:44:18.380
I thought of this based on what Ken just said.

02:44:18.380 --> 02:44:26.380
They had a very succinct set of what their guiding principles for assessment were.

02:44:26.380 --> 02:44:38.380
And I think in terms of being able to convey to lots of different constituents, families, kids, teachers, administrators,

02:44:39.380 --> 02:44:52.380
why we're doing what we're doing, something that's simple and high level and sort of values based is probably a good place to start.

02:44:52.380 --> 02:44:56.380
OK, other thoughts?

02:44:56.380 --> 02:45:00.380
I want to add something.

02:45:00.380 --> 02:45:03.380
Thank you, Sharon. That was actually pretty comprehensive of what we discussed.

02:45:03.380 --> 02:45:13.380
But I just throughout all the conversations that we had, and it goes back to even my work as a teacher becoming involved in 2014.

02:45:13.380 --> 02:45:19.380
And I even mentioned I was part of the bill project and and doing a lot of this professional learning with Smarter Balanced.

02:45:19.380 --> 02:45:24.380
The consortium is that building capacity is key.

02:45:24.380 --> 02:45:35.380
And some of the work that we've done, even as the CTA in collaboration with Stanford is the Instructional Leadership Corps and teachers leading this work in their schools,

02:45:35.380 --> 02:45:38.380
the district in their districts and in communities.

02:45:38.380 --> 02:45:47.380
I know a lot of the teachers that did some of the work through this project is doing professional learning with parents and engaging them,

02:45:47.380 --> 02:46:00.380
building partner partnering and building bridges with them and having parents going through the scoring through the assessments and having them understand how to best support their children.

02:46:00.380 --> 02:46:09.380
And so I think this goes back to even foundationally what we've been talking about with community schools and how we want to incorporate all stakeholders.

02:46:09.380 --> 02:46:20.380
And I think this work goes deeper when we do that and when we give teachers the power to lead, I think it can really move mountains.

02:46:20.380 --> 02:46:28.380
And I think going back to member Petillo-Brownson, that whole aspect around family, so important.

02:46:28.380 --> 02:46:39.380
And, you know, thinking about some of these courses, if we'd expanded to families, maybe we wouldn't have those public opinion polls that we currently have.

02:46:39.380 --> 02:46:42.380
Yeah, sure.

02:46:42.380 --> 02:46:57.380
On a couple of the details associated with one of the things we talked about was the importance of a task bank that would include rich meaningful tasks that engage students in relevant ways and also include student work and rubrics,

02:46:57.380 --> 02:47:08.380
which is related to how you involve both the teachers and the parents and families that you have things that can then be part of the instructional process.

02:47:08.380 --> 02:47:16.380
Both for assessment purposes, summative assessment purposes, but also for teaching and learning purposes and for those sharing purposes.

02:47:16.380 --> 02:47:24.380
The other thing we talked about as we were talking about how teachers need to be meaningfully engaged in every part of this, including the scoring.

02:47:24.380 --> 02:47:35.380
I was reflecting on the fact that in New York, you know, they use the Regents exams, which are designed and scored by teachers every year for hundreds of years for a long time.

02:47:35.380 --> 02:47:41.380
It actually is part of the sort of British Blue Book system, which you have translated to lots of places.

02:47:41.380 --> 02:47:48.380
But there's two professional development days every year for teachers to, you know, score the students work.

02:47:48.380 --> 02:47:56.380
The tasks are not secret. They know what they're teaching toward and they know, you know, what the kids will need to do.

02:47:56.380 --> 02:47:58.380
And then they're part of that process.

02:47:58.380 --> 02:48:05.380
So just kind of elaborating on the field experience, there are systems that have figured out how to make that possible.

02:48:05.380 --> 02:48:12.380
And so we talked a little bit about that, too, really just ingrained into the process and to classrooms and so forth.

02:48:12.380 --> 02:48:18.380
I think we need to get there. Other thoughts at this table.

02:48:18.380 --> 02:48:21.380
We good. All right.

02:48:21.380 --> 02:48:24.380
I think I'm going to turn it back over to you.

02:48:24.380 --> 02:48:26.380
Is that correct? Yes.

02:48:26.380 --> 02:48:35.380
And thank you all. You've been great participants.

02:48:35.380 --> 02:48:38.380
So we have learned a lot and we're going to all be thinking about this more.

02:48:38.380 --> 02:48:42.380
And this will not be the last chance we have to talk about it together.

02:48:42.380 --> 02:48:45.380
And I'm looking forward.

02:48:45.380 --> 02:48:54.380
We will be hearing more also from our assessment partners in the state about ideas that are surfacing for how we might move forward in science

02:48:54.380 --> 02:48:58.380
and then also in English language arts and math.

02:48:58.380 --> 02:49:06.380
One of the things that I've been thinking about as we've been talking today is how we conceptualize a system.

02:49:06.380 --> 02:49:13.380
You know, we have lots of innovative components as we do on most things in California here and there.

02:49:13.380 --> 02:49:21.380
And so I think we should all kind of keep that in mind that we're going to be thinking about what is plausible in that sense.

02:49:21.380 --> 02:49:30.380
And how do we link up supports for the teaching and learning process to the way in which assessments unfold?

02:49:30.380 --> 02:49:38.380
One of the things that I think is really interesting and what we saw today was the fact that in, for example, Massachusetts, they have these tasks.

02:49:38.380 --> 02:49:41.380
They're getting a bank of tests. They're doing classroom tasks.

02:49:41.380 --> 02:49:47.380
But the kinds of thing they're doing there are also appearing again on the summit of assessment.

02:49:48.380 --> 02:49:54.380
So they're linking across the domains in ways that are purposeful and deliberative.

02:49:54.380 --> 02:50:01.380
So I think that that's one part of our process and the others continue to think about these supports.

02:50:01.380 --> 02:50:05.380
And it was really wonderful, Deb. Thank you so much for facilitating.

02:50:05.380 --> 02:50:11.380
I also want to just take this moment to thank all the staff who are behind the curtain.

02:50:11.380 --> 02:50:14.380
We can't see them, but we want to thank them.

02:50:14.380 --> 02:50:23.380
When we envisioned having a little retreat, you know, I had no idea how complicated it would be to do a multimedia production, which is what we've done today.

02:50:23.380 --> 02:50:33.380
And really, that was made possible by many, many people who will at some point pop out from behind the curtain and you can take them to their face.

02:50:33.380 --> 02:50:40.380
I think at this point, we need to go ahead and open the phone line for public comment.

02:50:40.380 --> 02:50:46.380
So I'm going to ask whoever does that to open the phone line. And there we have it.

02:50:46.380 --> 02:50:57.380
What we see in our board members, members of the public who wish to provide comments on this item can do so by calling the telephone number and using the access code provided on the slide that is shown now.

02:50:57.380 --> 02:51:01.380
We encourage you to please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:51:01.380 --> 02:51:06.380
Please remember to turn down the speaker volume of your computers if you're following the live feed.

02:51:06.380 --> 02:51:13.380
Speakers will be limited to one minute each and we will go to public comment here in the boardroom first if there is any.

02:51:13.380 --> 02:51:21.380
Anybody wants to come to the microphone and then we will take public comments on the phone if there is any there.

02:51:21.380 --> 02:51:44.380
Hi, everybody. Manuel Bonrostro with Californians Together and I just want to thank Board President Linda Darling-Hammond and all of you for having this important conversation about assessments.

02:51:44.380 --> 02:51:52.380
A few things that stood out to us that we highly support are making sure that assessments are culturally relevant.

02:51:52.380 --> 02:51:55.380
The performance based assessments are critical.

02:51:55.380 --> 02:52:03.380
Love the suggestion about making sure that students have options and choice about assessments that they select.

02:52:03.380 --> 02:52:10.380
Definitely support the considerations for families and making sure that families understand assessments.

02:52:10.380 --> 02:52:30.380
One piece that we do suggest thinking a little bit about that we didn't hear as much today is how do we leverage the home languages of students as they do some of these assessments to make sure that that asset that they come with can be used so they can display the knowledge that they possess and that they come to school with.

02:52:30.380 --> 02:52:33.380
So thanks again and we look forward to more conversations about this.

02:52:33.380 --> 02:52:37.380
It's really a positive step for California to see all the wonderful work that we might do in the future.

02:52:37.380 --> 02:52:44.380
Thank you.

02:52:44.380 --> 02:52:45.380
Good afternoon, everybody.

02:52:45.380 --> 02:52:48.380
Shelly Spiegel-Coleman from Californians Together.

02:52:48.380 --> 02:52:51.380
The first thing I want to say, it's so nice to see you in person.

02:52:51.380 --> 02:52:54.380
We've been watching you for over two years on the screen, right?

02:52:54.380 --> 02:52:57.380
So this is just lovely.

02:52:57.380 --> 02:53:08.380
We both have been chatting while you've been chatting, and we're so excited about this new direction or the work, the potential of the work that we have in front of us.

02:53:08.380 --> 02:53:18.380
And there is one piece that we think would be really great to think about, and that is that right now I know the department has a contract with ETS to develop the interim assessments for LPAC.

02:53:18.380 --> 02:53:27.380
It would be really good if this, what you talked about today, was part of that development because the LPAC itself is somewhat of a performance assessment, right?

02:53:27.380 --> 02:53:31.380
And if the interims were that way, too, it would be terrific.

02:53:31.380 --> 02:53:33.380
So we'd love you to consider that.

02:53:33.380 --> 02:53:50.380
And again, congratulations and thanks so much for having this valuable, valuable conversation.

02:53:50.380 --> 02:53:52.380
Maybe all the comments in the room.

02:53:52.380 --> 02:53:54.380
Is that right?

02:53:54.380 --> 02:53:58.380
Okay, so is there any public comment by phone?

02:53:58.380 --> 02:54:00.380
We do not have any callers in the queue.

02:54:00.380 --> 02:54:02.380
All right.

02:54:02.380 --> 02:54:05.380
This would have been hard to watch on the live stream.

02:54:05.380 --> 02:54:12.380
If anybody did it, I would give them a lot of props for that.

02:54:12.380 --> 02:54:24.380
I'm going to ask member Roscoe-Gonzalez if she would like to make some final remarks as our assessment liaison.

02:54:24.380 --> 02:54:26.380
Great productive conversation.

02:54:26.380 --> 02:54:32.380
As you know, with improductive workgroups, students learn best, and I think it goes the same for us.

02:54:32.380 --> 02:54:39.380
I think we need to take into account our diverse student backgrounds and social and cultural experiences to level the playing field.

02:54:39.380 --> 02:54:47.380
And I hear about how important it is to include leveraging the students' home language also when it comes to creating these assessments.

02:54:47.380 --> 02:54:54.380
I know personally since English is a second language for myself too, so I know the importance of highlighting that too.

02:54:54.380 --> 02:55:01.380
But I'm excited to have teacher voice, to have teachers being part of the conversation,

02:55:01.380 --> 02:55:11.380
and to be the key component when it comes to creating these assessments and to building capacity throughout our state because we're the ones in the classroom.

02:55:11.380 --> 02:55:18.380
We're the ones that know the children firsthand and know the different learning modalities and how important it is for us,

02:55:18.380 --> 02:55:24.380
our differentiation in the classroom to target the needs of every single student.

02:55:24.380 --> 02:55:35.380
So I think that was the best takeaway that teachers are the center of this work as we embark in anything new or continue to as we progress.

02:55:35.380 --> 02:55:37.380
So thank you.

02:55:38.380 --> 02:55:44.380
And after this long day, I'm just going to bless this gathering

02:55:44.380 --> 02:55:53.380
and send everyone off to their next pursuits and to dinner and say that we will see you at 830 in the morning tomorrow.

02:55:53.380 --> 02:55:56.380
And it's wonderful to see everyone in person.

02:55:56.380 --> 02:55:57.380
Yay.
