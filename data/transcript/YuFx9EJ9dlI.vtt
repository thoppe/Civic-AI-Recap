WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.280
All right. Good morning. That lovely cool jazz that you heard playing may make you think

00:10.280 --> 00:16.200
we're having a relaxed board meeting today, but we have a lot to do. So seeing that the

00:16.200 --> 00:21.520
board members are now present, I hereby call the September 2023 meeting of the State Board

00:21.520 --> 00:27.120
of Education to order at 8.33 a.m. And I'd like to commence by saluting the flag. Member

00:27.240 --> 00:30.240
Rodriguez, will you please lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance?

00:30.240 --> 00:42.240
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for

00:42.240 --> 00:50.240
which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

00:50.240 --> 01:03.240
All right. Thank you. Okay. I have a bunch of announcements. I'd like to welcome board

01:03.240 --> 01:06.880
members, staff, and members of the public who are attending this board meeting in person,

01:06.880 --> 01:12.640
and I encourage everyone in the board room to wear masks. We appreciate those who are

01:12.640 --> 01:18.160
doing so. There is a surge going on, and we've had exposures in three of our last four board

01:19.080 --> 01:24.720
meetings, but no transmissions, so we want to be sure that masks are available for those

01:24.720 --> 01:29.640
who need one, and thank you for your consideration. In terms of the meeting, we'll be taking up

01:29.640 --> 01:34.200
item one, state board projects and priorities, and then we'll be clearing the room to adjourn

01:34.200 --> 01:42.560
for closed session. The proposed waiver consent items are W1 through 14. The proposed regular

01:42.560 --> 01:49.440
consent items are items four through seven. There is one public hearing on the agenda.

01:49.440 --> 01:54.120
Item 10 is the appeal of the denial of a petition for the establishment of a classroom-based

01:54.120 --> 02:01.600
charter school pursuant to California Education Code Section 47605K2. It's the review of the

02:01.600 --> 02:05.840
appeal and documentary record and decision to affirm or reverse the Los Angeles Unified

02:05.840 --> 02:10.720
School Districts and Los Angeles County Board of Education's determinations of the Vista

02:10.880 --> 02:18.520
Legacy Global Academy petition. We will reopen item one later today to take action on the

02:18.520 --> 02:23.920
preliminary report of actions draft July 20, 23 meeting minutes, and to report on our

02:23.920 --> 02:30.400
liaison assignments. Public comment will be accepted either in person or by phone. Members

02:30.400 --> 02:34.320
of the public wishing to call in for public comment should view the live stream of the

02:34.320 --> 02:39.800
meeting to know at what time public comment will occur for each item. Public comment may

02:39.880 --> 02:44.360
be provided by dialing the phone number, entering a participant access code, and then following

02:44.360 --> 02:49.920
each of the operator's prompts. Upon dialing in, callers will be added to a caller queue.

02:49.920 --> 02:54.440
The operator will notify callers when it is their turn to provide public comment and will

02:54.440 --> 02:59.360
also ask callers to please turn down the speaker volume of their computers if they are following

02:59.360 --> 03:04.720
the live webcast to avoid an echoing effect. Members of the public wishing to provide public

03:04.720 --> 03:09.680
comment in person should sign in using the binder at the table just outside the room.

03:10.560 --> 03:14.320
The binder is on the table with separate pages for each item number. This will help ensure

03:14.320 --> 03:19.720
that staff is able to track the in-person speakers for a particular item. Public comment

03:19.720 --> 03:25.600
is limited to one person, one minute for each speaker. When speakers require interpretation,

03:25.600 --> 03:31.080
two minutes will be provided. Item 11 is the general public comment item during which members

03:31.080 --> 03:36.440
of the public may provide comment on matters that are not specifically listed on the board's

03:37.200 --> 03:43.120
agenda. I will now open item one, which is our state board projects and priorities item.

03:43.120 --> 03:50.120
I hope our state superintendent, Tony Thurman, is able to beam in at this point. He is, he

03:50.120 --> 04:00.680
is in Southern California for multiple board meetings that he has to attend today. And

04:00.680 --> 04:03.640
he should be beaming in just about now.

04:03.840 --> 04:10.600
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond and members of the board. Good morning. I am ready

04:10.600 --> 04:19.800
when you all are. And if, if, if folks can help to enable my camera, I'll be able to

04:19.800 --> 04:29.960
be on camera any moment.

04:29.960 --> 04:39.160
We appreciate the very busy day you have ahead of you, Superintendent, with CSU and, and others.

04:39.160 --> 05:06.360
Do you think he might, do you think he might need to turn his camera on or?

05:09.160 --> 05:36.360
I think we should go ahead with audio.

06:36.360 --> 06:49.800
Okay, Superintendent Thurman, we think at this point, maybe it would be great to go

06:49.800 --> 06:59.960
ahead with just audio. If we are able to solve the video problem, you'll pop onto the screen.

06:59.960 --> 07:10.760
Happy that President Darling-Hammond, I am transitioning to an audio only presentation.

07:10.760 --> 07:18.120
Good morning, Madam President and members of the board. As President Darling-Hammond

07:18.120 --> 07:26.360
indicated, I am at the Cal State University headquarters. Today is an important discussion

07:26.520 --> 07:33.800
about revenue needs for the CSU system. And there's a vote today about a potential

07:34.440 --> 07:39.800
tuition increase. And I want to just say, as difficult as these conversations are, we know

07:39.800 --> 07:45.960
that our institutions need revenue and that our students often struggle when there are increases.

07:46.520 --> 07:50.840
I want to acknowledge everyone who I've had a chance to speak with these last two days

07:51.400 --> 07:56.040
on this subject. First, our students who have been very passionate about the challenges

07:56.040 --> 08:04.360
that they experience. I've also heard from other CSU trustees and staff that these are difficult

08:04.360 --> 08:09.480
times. You know, while there are no easy answers, one of the things that I'm proposing is that we

08:09.480 --> 08:16.120
work to find new permanent funding sources and new revenue that allows us to support our CSUs,

08:16.120 --> 08:23.080
our UCs, and our community colleges. And I want to thank all the educational partners who have joined

08:23.080 --> 08:28.440
in those conversations over the last several weeks to continue looking for new revenue sources

08:28.440 --> 08:34.120
as we try to figure out a way to build a new way for the CSU and the UC and the community college

08:34.120 --> 08:39.800
system. Many of you know the CSU provides us with many of our teachers who come through the teacher

08:39.800 --> 08:45.560
credentialing programs. And so it's exciting to be thinking about what we do in the future if we can

08:45.560 --> 08:51.320
work through these big challenges. As we get underway, I also want to recognize our new student

08:51.320 --> 09:02.040
board member, Anya, who began her term on August 1st. Welcome, Anya. Anya is a senior at Dr. D.

09:02.040 --> 09:07.160
Valley High School currently taking courses in economics and political science at Diablo Valley

09:07.160 --> 09:13.240
College. Anya is sure to be a stellar addition to our team. In addition to serving on the state

09:13.240 --> 09:19.000
board of education, Anya will be serving her second term as a student board member of San

09:19.000 --> 09:25.560
Ramon Valley Unified School District, a role in which Anya co-leads the student senate,

09:25.560 --> 09:32.760
a district-wide student advisory group consisting of reps from all secondary sites. Anya also serves

09:33.720 --> 09:37.720
on the school district's committees, including the OCAP committee, grading reform, equity and

09:37.720 --> 09:43.400
steering, and facilities master plan. Anya, thank you for your time and service, and we're so pleased

09:43.400 --> 09:49.560
to have you here and look forward to listening and learning from you. I also want to just

09:49.560 --> 09:58.200
acknowledge that this week we mark the anniversary of September 11th, that a difficult time when we

09:58.200 --> 10:04.840
lost many. I had an opportunity this week to speak with someone who lost a family member,

10:04.920 --> 10:12.440
and again want to acknowledge the family members who lost loved ones, our first responders,

10:14.200 --> 10:19.160
many of whom made the ultimate sacrifice, and as they say, that we should never forget,

10:19.160 --> 10:24.200
and that as we work with our students, we mark things that have happened in history that we

10:24.200 --> 10:30.920
should never forget, so that they may become civic-minded and be the leaders who will help us

10:31.000 --> 10:37.080
to make the right decisions going forward for how we promote democracy and justice and freedom

10:37.080 --> 10:44.360
and safety for all, and so we're grateful to all of our students as we share what is a difficult

10:44.360 --> 10:52.520
time, but we look for the learning on how we never forget these and other tragedies that have

10:52.520 --> 11:00.200
impacted the American people. Coming back to the CSUs and teachers, I want to report,

11:00.200 --> 11:05.720
Madam President, and thank you for being a part of what was the first ever that we've convened,

11:06.440 --> 11:11.560
a statewide teacher summit, teacher recruitment summit. I want to thank you for your remarks and

11:11.560 --> 11:17.240
being a part of that on that important day, hundreds of individuals across the state and

11:17.240 --> 11:22.440
some right here in the state boardroom who participated in our conversations about how

11:22.440 --> 11:26.680
we will recruit more teachers. We had some great breakout groups that are focused on how do we

11:26.680 --> 11:32.680
recruit from families of our military personnel who are stationed in California, someone who has

11:32.680 --> 11:37.960
a loved one who has teaching experience from another state. We had a very robust conversation

11:37.960 --> 11:43.560
about how do we bring retired teachers back into the classroom so that they can help us on a short

11:43.560 --> 11:50.920
term way and in a way that does not impact their pension benefits. We talked about how classified

11:51.000 --> 11:58.120
staff and expanded learning staff can become teachers, and we will continue to do this important

11:58.120 --> 12:05.480
work. Many of you know Karen Sher, who is a teacher on loan to us now at the Department of Education,

12:05.480 --> 12:11.240
who will be helping to lead some of our statewide work around teacher recruitment. We know there's

12:11.240 --> 12:14.680
a lot of work to be done. We've got a public service announcement and other efforts, but

12:15.640 --> 12:21.720
we are leaning in and I'm hopeful, and I think that the state of education is hopeful, but we've

12:21.720 --> 12:27.160
got to find ways to recruit more teachers and classified staff and administrators and others

12:27.160 --> 12:32.120
who will work in our schools. Many of you have followed that we've been engaged directly with

12:32.120 --> 12:41.320
school districts about issues of cultural conversations and issues about what kind of

12:41.400 --> 12:46.360
education students should have access to. We've been talking about inclusive education. Of course,

12:46.360 --> 12:51.880
we have an ethnic studies graduation requirement, and we put on a number of webinars in the last

12:51.880 --> 12:59.560
few weeks to support ethnic studies, including creating a new certification so that someone who

12:59.560 --> 13:05.880
wants to become able to train school districts and how they create their ethnic studies curricula,

13:05.880 --> 13:11.880
that they will have access to how the model curriculum that has been created and approved

13:11.880 --> 13:16.120
by the state board can be available to them. We continue to encourage our districts to work

13:16.120 --> 13:21.320
with someone who has experience working through the model curriculum. It has ways to really bring

13:21.320 --> 13:27.320
us the most robust conversations about the groups that have been part of ethnic studies

13:27.320 --> 13:33.080
and to leave out anything that might create division in our communities, and so we're excited

13:33.080 --> 13:40.520
that we had a few hundred people who actually participated and have received the certification

13:40.520 --> 13:47.480
and are now available to work on ethnic studies for our school districts.

13:48.120 --> 13:52.120
As we continue the conversation about inclusive education, I do want to let you know that

13:53.080 --> 13:58.360
we're standing up for students of color and for LGBTQ plus students. We have said that books

13:58.360 --> 14:03.400
should not be banned anywhere in the country and certainly not in California. To that end,

14:03.400 --> 14:09.320
I've sponsored a bill, AB 1078, that simply says if you ban a book with the intent of discriminating

14:09.320 --> 14:16.120
against students of color or LGBTQ students, that you will experience a fine for that to mitigate

14:16.120 --> 14:24.200
the impacts of those bans. We have engaged in deep conversation with school board members and

14:24.280 --> 14:29.800
students and parent groups about the importance of respecting the needs of students and protecting

14:29.800 --> 14:35.800
their privacy as it relates to their sexual identity. We've heard from many students who

14:35.800 --> 14:40.920
have said that they feel uncomfortable and worried and anxious about some of these new measures,

14:40.920 --> 14:46.360
and so I just want to remind students anywhere in our state, if ever you're feeling anxiety about

14:46.360 --> 14:53.240
anything, you can reach out 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to get help through what we call 9-8-8.

14:53.240 --> 14:57.880
9-8-8 is a number where you can text and call and you can talk with a counselor

14:58.520 --> 15:06.600
at any time who will be able to help you as you deal with whatever anxiety or other concerns

15:06.600 --> 15:11.560
that you have. I'm excited, Madam President and members of the board, to share with you

15:12.360 --> 15:19.160
some new work that we are launching to look into how to create more paid internships for California

15:19.240 --> 15:27.080
students and to link those internships to career pathways. I was honored to join the governor and

15:27.080 --> 15:31.240
President Darling-Hammond in a press conference last week where the governor announced a new

15:31.240 --> 15:36.520
executive order that will be very focused on pathway development and creating a new master

15:36.520 --> 15:43.560
plan on career education and how we prepare our students for the jobs of tomorrow. We have worked

15:43.560 --> 15:50.120
to create some paid internships that we'll be rolling out and meeting with those who work

15:50.120 --> 15:58.600
in CTE and youth development to show young people how they can earn and learn at the same time,

15:58.600 --> 16:02.200
how they can learn about different careers, whether that be in health care or

16:02.840 --> 16:08.600
biotech or technology, or if they want to learn about being in the apprenticeship training programs.

16:09.240 --> 16:17.000
We have trade programs that are looking to seek the next class of those who would work in our trades,

16:17.000 --> 16:25.080
and so we ask you to stand by and to join us in our summit on paid internships and preparing

16:25.080 --> 16:31.080
students for the jobs of tomorrow on October 10th, and that will take place in the state boardroom

16:31.080 --> 16:36.600
at 11 a.m. Finally, I'd like to just mention that we're approaching, in the month of September,

16:37.320 --> 16:42.520
voter education week, and we use that as a time when our schools remind our students that they

16:42.520 --> 16:47.400
can get registered to vote and provide them with all the important information about civic

16:47.400 --> 16:53.800
involvement. We know that we've provided now more than 10,000 seals of civic engagement over the

16:53.800 --> 17:00.040
last several years, and this is very much important and linked to voter education week.

17:00.040 --> 17:06.200
September the 18th through September the 29th represents voter education week, an important

17:06.200 --> 17:13.000
time for civic discussions and civic engagement. Finally, I just want to close with saying

17:13.560 --> 17:20.760
congratulations and welcome back to all of our schools who are now back to school, and we've

17:20.760 --> 17:27.800
had wonderful, wonderful visits with districts all across the state where families engage in

17:27.800 --> 17:34.600
attending classes, and we're so excited that we can welcome everybody back to school. We're

17:34.600 --> 17:39.240
hopeful for an exciting year. We know that there are challenges ahead, but we're prepared to help

17:39.240 --> 17:45.000
our students get better in all subjects and to engage families and to work to make this

17:45.000 --> 17:50.360
a great school year for all of our students. With that, Madam President, this concludes my report,

17:50.360 --> 17:53.320
and I will remain available if there are any questions for me.

17:53.320 --> 18:00.360
Thank you so much, and good luck on your very busy and important day ahead.

18:01.720 --> 18:07.880
I would like to shift now to welcome our new student board member, Anya Ayyepan,

18:08.440 --> 18:12.840
who is here to be sworn in for her very first board meeting. So Anya,

18:18.680 --> 18:21.800
we're going to do this right over here in front of the flags.

18:23.320 --> 18:32.840
So if you could raise your right hand and state after me, I, Anya Ayyepan,

18:34.440 --> 18:42.360
will solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States

18:44.440 --> 18:50.920
against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance

18:50.920 --> 18:59.000
to the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of California,

19:00.920 --> 19:09.800
that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion,

19:10.840 --> 19:19.160
and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which I am about to enter.

19:21.240 --> 19:31.400
Congratulations, Anya. I know your parents are here also.

19:33.880 --> 19:45.480
Please come up and get a picture with everyone. Congratulations. Wonderful.

19:51.560 --> 19:56.520
Thank you, and we'll hear more from you about our liaison reports.

20:02.920 --> 20:10.120
We always love these moments where we're joined by yet another brilliant member of our

20:10.120 --> 20:15.800
student body in California, and look forward to hearing more from you during the liaison reports.

20:16.760 --> 20:23.320
And with that, I'm going to give my report, and then we'll go into closed session. I, too,

20:23.320 --> 20:28.680
want to congratulate our teachers, principals, staff, students, and families on the start of

20:28.680 --> 20:36.440
the 2023-24 school year. I know months of planning go into these successful fall openings. There's so

20:36.440 --> 20:41.640
much excitement in schools around the state. I want to thank everyone who worked so hard to

20:41.640 --> 20:46.920
get our schools ready and to welcome back students. I especially want to welcome our

20:46.920 --> 20:51.800
youngest learners, our new transitional kindergarten students, who will be joining

20:51.800 --> 20:57.240
us in greater numbers than ever before as we launch the second year of transitional kindergarten

20:57.240 --> 21:07.240
expansion. Yay. And I cannot tell you how many excited children and parents and grandparents

21:07.240 --> 21:13.640
I have spoken to about TK, and we know that strong kindergarten readiness is essential to

21:13.640 --> 21:17.640
overall school success. We're excited to have our four-year-old students and their teachers

21:17.640 --> 21:23.640
embark on a year of fun and learning. This year also marks the first year of the full implementation

21:23.640 --> 21:29.080
of the expanded learning opportunities program. We expect that this program will bring access to

21:29.080 --> 21:33.960
after school and summer school enrichment opportunities to more than one million elementary

21:33.960 --> 21:39.640
school students across the state. These programs increase school engagement, stem summer learning

21:39.640 --> 21:46.120
loss, provide students with learning experiences in the arts, in STEM, sports, and other activities

21:46.840 --> 21:53.000
that spark joy and learning. And this is a program that is sort of baked into our

21:53.560 --> 21:58.680
ongoing school budget, so it's not something that's going to come and go, but it will be a constant

21:59.480 --> 22:06.040
reality for families and for children. Our teachers will also enjoy more support in literacy

22:06.040 --> 22:12.200
instruction this year, building off of the $250 million provided in the 2022 budget

22:13.320 --> 22:17.640
for reading coaches and literacy specialists in our highest need schools. We've added another

22:17.640 --> 22:24.520
$250 million to that program, and the budget also provides funding for a literacy roadmap

22:24.600 --> 22:29.480
to provide LEAs and schools with the resources that they need to effectively plan and access

22:29.480 --> 22:34.760
resources for literacy instruction for both native English speakers and multilingual learners.

22:34.760 --> 22:41.880
You know, we ground our work in California in the ELA-ELD curriculum framework that was passed in

22:41.880 --> 22:47.160
2014. We were one of the earliest states to basically adopt the science of reading and

22:47.160 --> 22:53.640
to do so with the needs of multilingual learners in mind as well as native English speakers,

22:53.640 --> 23:00.200
and we have been building upon that ever since. Instructional continuity is also going to be

23:00.760 --> 23:06.120
an issue that we need to pay a lot of attention to, and it's a key to academic success

23:06.120 --> 23:12.520
for children. Already in this school year, we've had school closures due to fires in the

23:12.520 --> 23:17.080
north of the state and storms and flooding in the south and inland portions of the state.

23:17.640 --> 23:22.520
Last year, in addition to the ongoing challenges of COVID and other viruses, we lost

23:22.520 --> 23:27.320
millions of school days to natural disasters that either close schools or prevent students

23:27.320 --> 23:33.480
from reaching them. So as the climate continues to evolve, our schools will need to adapt

23:33.480 --> 23:38.200
to these emerging conditions to ensure that even when students can't physically attend school,

23:38.200 --> 23:43.480
they can continue to learn. And during the pandemic, we did learn many lessons about

23:43.480 --> 23:49.640
how to support continuity of instruction through remote and hybrid learning. We will seek ways to

23:49.640 --> 23:54.600
support schools to build on that knowledge to make sure our students can access education,

23:54.600 --> 24:01.320
even when they cannot physically access a school building. Now switching gears to the state board

24:01.320 --> 24:07.800
business, we have several advisory openings with applications due September 29th, and I know our

24:07.800 --> 24:12.600
screening committee is looking forward to receiving those applications. We are looking

24:12.600 --> 24:18.600
for qualified educators for the Instructional Quality Commission and for a student IQC member.

24:19.160 --> 24:24.040
There are also openings on the Advisory Commission on Special Education and the California

24:24.040 --> 24:28.840
Practitioners Advisory Group. We are also accepting applications for next year's student

24:28.840 --> 24:37.160
board member, which seems a little premature, but it does take a long time to find these amazing

24:37.160 --> 24:43.880
students and those applications are due September 22nd. You can find out about all of these

24:43.880 --> 24:51.480
opportunities on our website. Finally, I need to make a bittersweet announcement. It is my honor

24:51.480 --> 24:57.080
and privilege to announce that Janet Weeks, the State Board of Education's Communications Director,

24:57.080 --> 25:05.240
has retired as of August 31st. We are very happy for Janet, but we are very sad for ourselves.

25:06.360 --> 25:10.200
Her retirement is a huge loss for board members and staff.

25:10.200 --> 25:17.160
Janet was appointed by Governor Brown in 2016. She was reappointed by Governor Newsom in 2020.

25:17.720 --> 25:22.840
Over the course of her career at the state board, Janet has been a key player in every important

25:22.840 --> 25:28.760
decision that has come to the board. She helped lead the redesign of the dashboard. Anyone who

25:28.760 --> 25:34.040
has been around a while can remember the trivial pursuit pies, and thanks to Janet, they are gone.

25:35.000 --> 25:40.120
She has helped navigate the board's work on many of the difficult issues that have come our way

25:40.200 --> 25:45.160
especially curriculum frameworks in history, health, ethnic studies, and most recently

25:45.160 --> 25:50.920
mathematics. And while she is brilliant with the media, Janet has been far more than a

25:50.920 --> 25:57.480
communications director. I think it's fair to say that without her policy expertise and media know-how,

25:57.480 --> 26:02.840
those framework adoptions would not have happened. Prior to her appointment at the board, Janet was

26:02.840 --> 26:09.000
a reporter at USA Today and then TV Guide. She would often regale the staff with funny stories

26:09.000 --> 26:13.800
about her interviews of TV celebrities back in the days when there was a printed TV Guide,

26:16.200 --> 26:22.200
including her visit to Australia for the filming of Survivor. Upon leaving journalism,

26:22.200 --> 26:27.800
Janet and her family, including her husband Rocky and daughters Rose and Lily, relocated

26:27.800 --> 26:33.880
to Sacramento where Janet became an English and journalism teacher at CK McClatchy High School

26:33.880 --> 26:39.080
in the Sacramento City Unified School District. She left the classroom for the district office

26:39.080 --> 26:44.040
where she was communications manager for six years, and in this role she wrote the Sacramento

26:44.040 --> 26:48.600
City Unified Weekly Newsletter, the speeches for the superintendent, supported principals,

26:48.600 --> 26:55.480
and district staff with media relations during times of crisis and otherwise. She developed the

26:55.480 --> 27:02.440
SCUSD's Community Guide to the LCAP, which was later praised by my colleague and former state

27:02.440 --> 27:08.680
board president Mike Kirst as a helpful tool for engagement. In late 2016, she joined the state

27:08.680 --> 27:14.120
board of education as communications director, and replacing Janet is really not possible.

27:14.680 --> 27:19.160
I doubt there's anyone else in the state who has interviewed TV stars, managed high school

27:19.160 --> 27:24.680
journalism students, navigated local boards, state boards, and state government successfully.

27:25.640 --> 27:31.160
More than anything, Janet has been a great colleague who brings a sense of fun to every

27:31.160 --> 27:35.720
meeting, whether it's decorating her office with pictures of Ryan Gosling or giving

27:36.360 --> 27:44.840
colleagues gifts from her storage unit. Talk about regifting. Janet brings a bit of joy with

27:44.840 --> 27:51.000
her wherever she goes, and on a personal note, I really need to thank Janet for all of her

27:51.000 --> 27:57.160
hard work, her support. I've relied on her every day on her skills, her advice, her dedication

27:57.160 --> 28:02.520
during my term on the state board. So during her well-deserved retirement, Janet plans to

28:02.520 --> 28:06.920
travel with her family, plan her daughter's wedding, and attend a lot of concerts with

28:06.920 --> 28:15.160
her friends. We wish her well. We will sorely miss Janet's presence, and we do have a certificate

28:15.160 --> 28:31.160
for Janet, a small token of our deep appreciation. Brooks, would you do the honors?

28:46.120 --> 28:49.160
It doesn't take long.

28:49.160 --> 29:08.040
Now, can you hear me?

29:11.080 --> 29:16.840
Some communications director, right? Just proving wrong everything Dr. Darling-Hammond just said.

29:17.160 --> 29:25.400
Thank you so much. I know I've had a really weird career trajectory if you go from TV Guide to the

29:25.400 --> 29:30.360
State Board of Education, but I feel like being yelled at by Adam Sandler and Kelsey Grammer at

29:30.360 --> 29:36.520
different moments sort of prepared me for public education, so it all makes sense if you think

29:36.520 --> 29:44.600
about it. So anyways, thank you so much for your kind words. It's really been an honor of lifetime

29:45.480 --> 29:49.800
to work for you all, and I miss you all already, and it's so lovely to see you here today, and

29:49.800 --> 29:55.400
thank you so much. It's been a privilege to learn from Dr. Darling-Hammond, from everyone here,

29:55.960 --> 30:02.840
and from the amazing staff at the State Board of Education, really the smartest and exceedingly

30:02.840 --> 30:09.880
kind people you could ever want to work with, and the support of the CDE colleagues. I mean,

30:09.880 --> 30:17.720
none of this happens without them, and so it's just been great, and you know, public education

30:17.720 --> 30:24.040
is this great big thing in California. You know, there's 5.8 million kids, 10,000 schools,

30:24.040 --> 30:31.240
1,000 school districts, 58 county offices of education. It's this huge thing, but for people,

30:31.240 --> 30:38.120
it's a very personalized and individual experience, and so the work of the State Board is to navigate

30:38.120 --> 30:44.520
that really strange space where you're working with a giant system that is deeply personal

30:44.520 --> 30:51.800
to each person that goes through it, and you guys do that work so deftly and so sensitively

30:51.800 --> 31:01.800
and so smartly, and I'm going to be rooting for you from the sidelines, and I will be watching

31:01.800 --> 31:07.560
The Wire because I feel it's important to watch it, and everybody tells me it's the best television

31:07.560 --> 31:16.280
show. I've never seen an episode, but between episodes of The Wire, I will be rooting for you,

31:19.320 --> 31:23.640
and I just wish you all the best of luck, and thank you so much again. Thank you.

31:23.800 --> 31:41.160
Thank you so much, Janet. At this point, we are going to move to closed session where the

31:41.160 --> 31:47.480
board will discuss or take action on the following legal matters, MSC versus State and Mark S versus

31:47.480 --> 31:51.800
State. We'd like to ask members of the public to please leave the room at this time.

32:04.360 --> 32:11.560
All right. Welcome back. In closed session, the board discussed and took action on the

32:11.560 --> 32:18.840
following legal matters, MSC versus State and Mark S versus State, and we will move on to item

32:18.840 --> 32:24.680
two, which is the local control and accountability plan template, revision drafts consistent with

32:24.680 --> 32:32.840
California Education Code section 52064. This is not an action item, but we are providing feedback

32:32.840 --> 32:38.520
regarding the draft LCAP template and instructions that incorporate the requirements outlined in

32:38.520 --> 32:47.960
Senate Bill 114, and the CDE also recommends that the State Board take additional action

32:47.960 --> 32:52.840
as deemed necessary and appropriate. This item will be presented by Nancy Kim Portillo

32:52.840 --> 33:03.800
and Josh Strong of the CDE. Please begin. Good morning. You all can hear me? Wonderful.

33:04.360 --> 33:10.280
Good morning, Board President Darling Hammond, Chief Deputy Nicely, and members of the board.

33:10.280 --> 33:14.920
My name is Nancy Kim Portillo, and I'm the Deputy Superintendent of the Student Achievement Branch.

33:15.880 --> 33:20.280
I also bring you greetings from William McGee, Director of the Student Achievement and Support

33:20.280 --> 33:26.760
Division, who is currently in Washington, D.C. on behalf of the department. I am here today to

33:26.760 --> 33:33.080
introduce item two, local control and accountability plan template, revision drafts consistent with

33:33.080 --> 33:42.440
California Ed Code section 52064. On July 10, 2023, Senate Bill 114 was signed into law.

33:43.560 --> 33:51.000
Among other things, Senate Bill 114 amended California Ed Code section 52064, which requires

33:51.000 --> 33:57.000
revisions be made to the LCAP template and instructions for the 2024-25 school year.

33:58.280 --> 34:02.440
Item two will provide the board with a summary of revisions to the LCAP template

34:02.440 --> 34:08.200
and instructions required by Senate Bill 114, as well as additional revisions being proposed by

34:08.200 --> 34:13.720
the California Department of Education, consistent with the direction provided by the board at its

34:13.720 --> 34:20.680
November 2021 meeting to identify opportunities to streamline the template. At this time, I'd like

34:20.680 --> 34:25.880
to introduce Joshua Strong, the Administrator of the Local Agency Systems Support Office,

34:25.880 --> 34:28.200
who will be presenting item two. Thank you.

34:32.680 --> 34:37.000
Thank you, Deputy Superintendent Portillo. Good morning, members of the board,

34:37.720 --> 34:46.120
Chief Deputy Nicely, President Darling-Hammond. As Deputy Superintendent Portillo said, I'm Joshua

34:46.120 --> 34:50.520
Strong. I'm the Administrator of the Local Agency Systems Support Office here at the department,

34:51.160 --> 34:56.360
and I'm here to talk to you about the LCAP template and instruction revisions

34:57.000 --> 35:03.000
that are being proposed at this point in time. Just some brief grounding and background for

35:03.000 --> 35:09.240
all of you. As all of you are most likely aware, the LCAP, the Local Control and Accountability

35:09.240 --> 35:15.400
Plan, is a three-year plan that describes the goals, actions, services, expenditures

35:15.400 --> 35:20.600
that support positive student outcomes to address state and local priority areas.

35:21.480 --> 35:28.680
The LCAP development process is intended to serve three related functions. The first of

35:28.680 --> 35:37.880
which is comprehensive strategic planning, and within Senate Bill 114, the following phrase was

35:37.880 --> 35:43.320
added, particularly to address and reduce disparities in opportunities and outcomes

35:43.320 --> 35:48.840
between student groups indicated by the California School Dashboard. That's a new addition to statute.

35:49.400 --> 35:55.720
And so, as you'll see throughout the template and the instructions, we really tried to highlight

35:55.720 --> 36:01.320
that particular piece around addressing and reducing disparities in opportunities and outcomes

36:01.320 --> 36:06.440
as part of the instructions in particular. Another one of the three roles that it plays

36:06.440 --> 36:12.520
is that of meaningful educational engagement of educational partners, and then accountability

36:12.520 --> 36:16.920
and compliance, because there's elements of that accountability and compliance system

36:16.920 --> 36:24.840
that live within the LCAP. As you've already heard, Senate Bill 114 amended Education Code

36:24.840 --> 36:33.000
Section 52064 in order to require some specific revisions be made to the LCAP template and to

36:33.000 --> 36:39.640
the instructions. Those are summarized for you in Attachment 1 of the item.

36:39.800 --> 36:48.040
Education Code Section 52064 is the piece of education code that specifically outlines what

36:48.040 --> 36:53.800
is required to be included within the template and the instructions. And as part of that education

36:53.800 --> 37:01.560
code, just as a reminder, it outlines that the LCAP template itself is to use language that's

37:01.560 --> 37:06.440
understandable and accessible to parents to the greatest extent practicable, and that the

37:06.440 --> 37:13.960
instructions for the LCAP are allowed to contain more technical information for LEAs and for those

37:13.960 --> 37:21.160
that are writing the plan. For that reason, you'll see a difference between the template and the

37:21.160 --> 37:27.880
format of the template and the instructions within the template. In terms of our revision

37:27.880 --> 37:34.440
timeline, at this point in time, we have brought the LCAP template and instructions, our initial

37:34.440 --> 37:41.160
draft, we took them to the LCAP advisory group, which is an ad hoc group of technical experts

37:41.160 --> 37:46.920
and partners throughout the field that we bring together any time that we need to make revisions.

37:48.120 --> 37:55.480
The role of the LCAP advisory group is really to identify areas of fatal flaws or things in the

37:55.480 --> 38:01.640
initial proposals that we're making, because they're folks from districts, county offices,

38:01.640 --> 38:07.320
advocacy groups, and other statewide educational partners that will be able to point out,

38:08.120 --> 38:13.160
here are the major holes or the major issues with what's being proposed initially.

38:13.880 --> 38:20.440
After we get feedback from them, we make revisions, and we've taken that statewide.

38:20.440 --> 38:28.600
We had a statewide webinar to solicit input. That webinar was attended by 800-plus individual

38:29.240 --> 38:36.600
attendees. Of that, we received feedback both during the webinar, but then also via email

38:36.600 --> 38:43.320
following that. We took the template and the instructions to the California Practitioners

38:43.320 --> 38:47.560
Advisory Group, received input from them, and we're bringing it to you now.

38:48.520 --> 38:54.600
Following your recommendations, we will make adjustments to the template and the instructions.

38:54.680 --> 38:59.480
We'll again take that to the LCAP advisory group, take that out to another statewide webinar,

38:59.480 --> 39:07.800
and bring it back to you in November. Statute allows you, allows the state board until January

39:07.800 --> 39:15.080
of 2024 to adopt the template and the instructions. However, in practice, we found that if we can have

39:15.080 --> 39:22.760
the board adopt that in November, the additional two months provides a lot of valuable time for

39:22.760 --> 39:30.120
LEAs to be able to get trained on the new requirements, to be able to make adjustments,

39:31.000 --> 39:37.800
and have that information in hand in concurrence with the release of the dashboard so that that

39:37.800 --> 39:44.200
aids them in having the time that they need to craft plans that are going to really make a

39:44.200 --> 39:49.960
difference for their students. That's especially critical when we're talking about the 2024-25

39:49.960 --> 39:56.600
school year, as it's the first year in the next three-year cycle of the LCAP. They'll be making

39:56.600 --> 40:04.520
their plans for the next three years, and so having that information available to them is critical.

40:06.280 --> 40:12.520
We've provided you with five different attachments within the item. Attachment one is the summary of

40:12.520 --> 40:17.960
required and proposed revisions. Attachment two is the current LCAP template and instructions.

40:17.960 --> 40:22.680
Attachment three is the proposed revisions to the template and the instructions using track

40:22.680 --> 40:29.640
changes. Attachment four are for those of you that look at track changes and your heads explode.

40:30.680 --> 40:35.080
It provides you with the opportunity to compare attachment two and attachment four and see

40:35.080 --> 40:41.000
where the changes are and what it looks like without having to deal with all of the red and

40:41.000 --> 40:46.280
blue and strikethroughs and underlines. And then attachment five is the proposed

40:47.080 --> 40:52.760
LCAP annual updates template and instructions that's referred to in attachment one and that

40:52.760 --> 41:00.040
we'll speak briefly about. So I want to take some time to go into a summary of the required

41:00.040 --> 41:09.240
and the proposed revisions. These are revisions that are being proposed by and large based on

41:09.240 --> 41:15.240
the requirements of Senate bill 114. There are also some additional revisions that we're proposing

41:16.120 --> 41:23.160
in order to help the readability of the template and the instructions as well as to shorten

41:23.160 --> 41:31.160
the template in response to the board's direction at its November 2021 meeting to identify

41:31.160 --> 41:36.120
opportunities to streamline the template and the instructions. So all of this information is

41:36.120 --> 41:44.200
provided for you in attachment one of the item. So I want to start off talking about the intent

41:44.200 --> 41:53.480
of the LCAP development process. As has already been identified, the addition to the education

41:53.480 --> 42:02.040
code section 52064 relating to addressing and reducing disparities in opportunities and outcomes

42:02.040 --> 42:09.320
between student groups indicated by the California school dashboard is one of the key pieces of new

42:09.320 --> 42:19.640
legislation within that ed code. And it really kind of seeks to draw together the dashboard

42:19.640 --> 42:32.840
and the LCAP into a cohesive improvement system to allow LEAs to look at what's going on in the

42:32.840 --> 42:38.280
dashboard, address those things through the LCAP and be able to make substantive change

42:39.080 --> 42:46.280
for those student groups and those schools that need that additional support within their plans.

42:47.240 --> 42:53.240
So this shows up within the instructions for the LCAP template.

42:55.960 --> 43:02.520
The remainder of the proposed recommendations, we're just going to walk through

43:02.520 --> 43:09.240
in order of how they appear within the template and the instructions so that it doesn't necessarily

43:09.240 --> 43:14.600
follow the order that they appear in law, it follows the order they appear in the template.

43:15.480 --> 43:21.880
So statute requires that the LCAP include a plan summary that provides general information

43:21.880 --> 43:27.480
about the LEA and highlights of the LCAP, including reflections on the LEA's annual

43:27.480 --> 43:32.760
performance on the dashboard as well as local data, so both state and local data.

43:33.480 --> 43:39.080
Senate bill 114 adds the requirement that LEAs that are eligible for technical assistance

43:39.160 --> 43:51.160
are pursuant to education code section 47607.3, 52071, 52071.5, 52072, and 52072.5

43:51.880 --> 43:56.120
must also include a summary of the work that's underway as part of that technical assistance.

43:57.000 --> 44:05.080
Now, the within those sections of education code, the most common form of technical assistance

44:05.080 --> 44:11.480
there is frequently referred to as differentiated assistance. However, it's important to note that

44:11.480 --> 44:16.840
that is not the only option for technical assistance that exists within those pieces of

44:16.840 --> 44:23.400
education code, which is why within the instructions, you won't see it referred to

44:23.400 --> 44:29.240
as differentiated assistance. It's referred to as technical assistance because it also includes

44:29.240 --> 44:35.800
instances where an LEA has actually requested to receive technical assistance

44:36.360 --> 44:41.720
from a county office of education or instances where a county office of education

44:41.720 --> 44:48.840
has been unable to approve a school district's LCAP on or before the statutory deadline of October

44:48.840 --> 44:54.440
8th and has to work with that school district, provide them with technical assistance to ensure

44:54.440 --> 45:00.760
that the LCAP reaches an approvable state. So those are other options for technical assistance

45:00.760 --> 45:08.600
that exist within these sections of education code. To address this, we're proposing some

45:08.600 --> 45:17.320
revisions to the instructions. In addition, we're also proposing to consolidate the prompts within

45:17.320 --> 45:24.440
the template itself in order to condense the information that's there and streamline what

45:24.440 --> 45:31.160
LEAs are asked to provide initially, while at the same time providing LEAs with the flexibility to

45:31.160 --> 45:38.280
continue to call out those areas that they want to highlight for the public within the planned summer.

45:40.440 --> 45:47.080
Moving on to the engaging educational partners section, education code section 52064B10

45:47.160 --> 45:53.560
was amended to require that schools that generate LCFF equity multiplier funding

45:53.560 --> 46:00.120
must include a summary of how they're consulting with educational partners at schools generating

46:00.120 --> 46:05.640
those funds in the development of the LCAP. And this ties in with another requirement that

46:05.640 --> 46:11.880
we'll speak to more in a little bit, but that is the requirement, the new requirement that

46:12.360 --> 46:20.520
for each school that's receiving LCFF equity multiplier funding, there be a specific focus goal

46:20.520 --> 46:28.120
within the LCAP for that school. So in order to ensure that the development of that goal for that

46:28.120 --> 46:34.440
school includes the educational partners at that school, we're proposing to include within the

46:35.400 --> 46:45.160
instructions based on ed code the requirement that LEAs that have those required goals

46:45.880 --> 46:53.080
need to include educational partners from their LCFF equity multiplier schools in the process to

46:53.080 --> 46:58.360
develop the LCAP. So again, when we're talking about educational partners here, we're talking

46:58.360 --> 47:06.120
about students, parents, teachers, other school staff, local bargaining units, and the community

47:06.120 --> 47:14.600
in general. So it's really the intent here is to really get the input from the entire school

47:14.600 --> 47:22.680
community in terms of developing those specific goals for those specific schools. In addition,

47:22.680 --> 47:27.880
we're proposing the department is proposing to remove one of the prompts within the engaging

47:27.880 --> 47:35.320
educational partners section of the LCAP because it's not explicitly required by statute while at

47:35.320 --> 47:41.800
the same time preserving the flexibilities that LEAs have to be able to provide that additional

47:41.800 --> 47:49.000
context within the engaging educational partner section if they want to. And we'll look at that

47:49.000 --> 47:56.120
a little bit later in the presentation. Within the goals and action section, education code section

47:56.120 --> 48:03.880
52064E4 was amended to specify that LEAs must consider their performance on the state and local

48:03.880 --> 48:09.480
indicators included within the dashboard in determining whether and how to prioritize the

48:09.480 --> 48:16.680
goals, specific actions, and related expenditures within the LCAP. Up until this point, it's simply

48:17.240 --> 48:23.560
that LEAs should do this. Now they must do this as part of the consideration of how it is that

48:23.560 --> 48:29.160
they're prioritizing their goals. And so the LCAP template instructions have been amended to reflect

48:29.160 --> 48:36.360
that particular requirement. In terms of measuring and reporting outcomes, which is where the metrics

48:36.360 --> 48:46.600
and outcomes for the goals live. Senate Bill 114 added education code section 52064E3,

48:46.600 --> 48:52.440
which requires that for each action and budgeted expenditure that's provided to all students on a

48:52.440 --> 48:57.480
district-wide, county-wide, or charter-wide basis, we otherwise refer to that as LEA-wide,

48:57.960 --> 49:10.280
pursuant to education code section 4223.07. One or more specific metrics to monitor the intended

49:10.280 --> 49:18.600
outcome of that action and budgeted expenditure must be identified. All of you at this point in

49:18.600 --> 49:26.040
time are probably aware of the requirement within both LCFF and the LCAP to increase or improve

49:26.040 --> 49:33.720
services for low-income English learner or foster youth students. What this particular piece of

49:33.720 --> 49:40.840
education code, this addition, has done is to require that any actions that are being provided

49:40.840 --> 49:48.200
LEA-wide within the plan and are identified as contributing towards meeting the requirements

49:48.200 --> 49:55.240
to increase or improve services for those three student groups has to have at least one metric

49:56.040 --> 50:05.320
identified, called out within the plan of how the LEA is tracking the performance of that particular

50:05.320 --> 50:12.200
action within the plan. Prior to this, there hasn't been a requirement for any sort of one-to-one

50:12.200 --> 50:18.920
correlation between specific metric and a specific action. This is the first time that this exists

50:18.920 --> 50:25.560
within the plan. It doesn't limit an LEA from being able to say, okay, we're going to use

50:25.560 --> 50:32.360
several metrics to assess the performance of this particular action. But at a minimum, an LEA has

50:32.360 --> 50:41.080
to include one metric for each contributing LEA-wide action within its plan. So that's

50:41.080 --> 50:47.960
been called out within the instructions as part of this new requirement. As part of that requirement,

50:47.960 --> 50:54.920
we've also provided LEAs, at least the proposal at this point in time, is to provide LEAs with

50:54.920 --> 51:01.320
flexibility on where in the template they address that requirement. Within the template and the

51:01.320 --> 51:08.520
instructions, there are a number of places that an LEA might choose to place that just based on the

51:08.520 --> 51:14.920
fact that it's a metric, it's addressing an action, and it's related to increasing or improving

51:14.920 --> 51:21.960
services. And so the three places that LEAs are currently being provided flexibility to address

51:21.960 --> 51:28.280
this is within the description of the metric itself, within the description of the action,

51:28.920 --> 51:34.760
or within the first prompt of the increased or improved services section of the LCAP,

51:34.760 --> 51:40.360
which is the prompt where LEA-wide actions are addressed within the plan.

51:41.240 --> 51:47.560
So that provides LEAs with the flexibility to be able to call out what the metric or metrics

51:47.560 --> 51:54.360
related to that action is within the plan in a way that best suits the needs of their community.

51:57.320 --> 52:07.640
Required goals. Education code section 52064E5 and E6 previously required that an LEA

52:08.920 --> 52:15.480
include a specific goal within its plan if it had consistently low-performing students

52:15.480 --> 52:22.600
or consistently low-performing schools as identified on the California school dashboard

52:22.600 --> 52:34.120
within the LEA. Senate Bill 114 amended those two pieces of education code so that those required

52:34.120 --> 52:41.480
goals are no longer required. So that piece of the instructions is being removed from the LCAP.

52:42.280 --> 52:51.320
However, in place of that, education code section 52064E7 was amended to require that LEAs that are

52:51.320 --> 52:59.800
receiving LCFF equity multiplier funding include one or more focus goals for each school within

52:59.800 --> 53:08.440
the LEA that's generating that funding within the plan. It's important to note here that

53:09.160 --> 53:17.160
LCFF equity multiplier funding is obviously not going to be received by all schools statewide.

53:17.160 --> 53:24.360
It's specific targeted funding that's going to schools that meet certain eligibility requirements.

53:25.400 --> 53:32.840
And so as part of this requirement, one of the things that you'll see is that the instructions

53:32.840 --> 53:38.600
have been amended. However, other than amending the instructions to include this,

53:38.600 --> 53:46.200
we're not calling out LCFF equity multiplier goals in general on the template, in part because they

53:46.200 --> 53:54.840
don't apply or won't apply to the vast majority of LEAs statewide. Now, some LEAs statewide,

53:54.840 --> 54:02.440
this is going to have a significant impact because if you have an LEA that has 15

54:03.000 --> 54:10.360
LCFF equity multiplier schools, that means they will have 15 required goals within their plan.

54:11.480 --> 54:16.280
So for some LEAs, this will have a significant impact on their plan.

54:16.840 --> 54:20.280
For other LEAs, this will have no impact on their plan.

54:20.280 --> 54:33.480
Now, in terms of required actions, Education Code Section 52064B2 was added the requirement

54:33.480 --> 54:38.440
that an LEA that's eligible for technical assistance, and I won't read the Ed Code sections

54:38.440 --> 54:45.000
again, we've already done that, must include actions within the LCAP that address the work

54:45.000 --> 54:50.760
underway as part of that technical assistance. So this is a specific requirement in addition to

54:50.760 --> 54:56.200
the requirement that we discussed earlier to include a summary within the plan summary of how

54:56.200 --> 55:03.720
that technical assistance is going on. This particular requirement requires that specific

55:03.720 --> 55:13.400
goals be provided within the LCAP to implement that work that's going on as part of the technical

55:13.400 --> 55:20.920
assistance that's being received. Those actions will obviously be integrated within goals.

55:21.560 --> 55:30.520
Sometimes those actions are going to be integrated within the specific goal LCFF equity multiplier

55:30.520 --> 55:36.280
school goals that we just talked about because part of the requirement within those LCFF equity

55:36.280 --> 55:41.960
multiplier school goals is that they have to address any schools that are receiving the lowest

55:41.960 --> 55:49.320
performance level on the dashboard as well as any instances of teacher assignment,

55:51.240 --> 55:57.480
teacher preparedness, teacher misassignments in comparison with the rest of the LEA. So to the

55:57.480 --> 56:04.920
extent that there's a significant difference between the staff that's providing instruction

56:04.920 --> 56:11.000
at the LCFF equity multiplier schools and the remainder of the district that the LEA seek to

56:11.000 --> 56:17.800
make progress in ensuring that those teachers at the LCFF equity multiplier schools are better

56:17.800 --> 56:27.720
trained, better prepared, and that there's less of a discrepancy between the teachers within those

56:27.720 --> 56:36.920
schools. In addition, education code section 52064 E6 was amended to include the requirement that

56:36.920 --> 56:43.640
LEAs have to include specific actions in the LCAP to address all instances where a school or a

56:43.640 --> 56:51.000
student group within an LEA or a student group within a school in the LEA receives the lowest

56:51.000 --> 56:57.160
performance level on one or more state indicators on the dashboard. So for example, an LEA is going

56:57.160 --> 57:05.240
to have to include specific actions within the LCAP to address instances of say their English

57:05.240 --> 57:12.040
learner population scoring in the red on an ELA indicator on the dashboard. Okay, they would have

57:12.040 --> 57:20.280
to have one or more actions that are included in the plan there. In addition, education code section

57:20.280 --> 57:28.760
52064 E5 has been revised to specify that LEAs that have a specific English learner student group

57:29.480 --> 57:37.320
or a numerically significant long-term English learner student subgroup must include specific

57:37.320 --> 57:44.680
actions within the LCAP. Education code section, one of the things that Senate Bill 114 did

57:44.680 --> 57:52.120
was to revise education code section 52052 to include long-term English learners as a numerically

57:52.120 --> 58:00.520
significant subgroup for purposes of the dashboard. One of the things to note about that

58:00.520 --> 58:10.200
is that unlike the majority of the student groups which have an N size of 30, the N size for LTELs

58:10.200 --> 58:18.760
is 15, along with your foster youth and your homeless youth. So what this particular required

58:18.760 --> 58:27.560
action is putting into place is specific actions when an LEA has 30 or more English learners

58:28.440 --> 58:36.120
and or 15 or more long-term English learners. And we'll talk about that a little bit further on in

58:36.120 --> 58:43.960
the presentation. To address these requirements, we've proposed some additions to the LCAP template

58:44.920 --> 58:51.240
and then a couple of changes within the actually more of the changes in the instructions

58:51.240 --> 58:53.320
and a couple of changes within the template itself.

58:55.720 --> 59:03.480
Moving on to the goal analysis. The goal analysis is required to be included as part of the annual

59:03.480 --> 59:11.640
update of the plan to reflect on how an LEA has implemented the goals and actions throughout the

59:11.640 --> 59:22.200
preceding year. And so currently or previously, education code included a requirement that LEAs

59:22.200 --> 59:28.840
assess the effectiveness of a specific action. LEAs are now, based on changes to ed code,

59:28.840 --> 59:35.160
required to assess the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of an action. So to what

59:35.160 --> 59:45.160
extent was an action effective? To what extent did the action help the LEA to make progress towards

59:45.880 --> 59:53.720
achieving its goal? Or the action didn't make it have any substantive impact on the LEA making

59:53.720 --> 59:59.000
progress towards achieving its goal? Obviously, in order to know that, an LEA is going to have

59:59.080 --> 01:00:06.840
to ensure that it's got sufficient metrics in place to address whether an action is effective

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:13.640
or ineffective. And so that's going to be a major focus of the statewide training that my office is

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:19.560
going to be doing beginning in November and running through December, maybe early January. We'll see.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:28.040
In addition, Senate Bill 114 amended Education Code Section 52064

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:34.040
to include the requirement that LEAs, I just said that, apologies.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:47.640
So Education Code Section 52064E8 specifies that LEAs must change actions that have not

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:56.680
proven effective over a three-year period. This is a new requirement. Previously, there was a

01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:05.560
requirement in the transition from the 2019-20 to the 2021-22 LCAP that an LEA assessed the

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:13.080
effectiveness of its contributing actions, its actions that were used to increase or improve

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:18.760
services for its low-income English learner and foster youth students. This is the first time

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:24.840
that an assessment of the effectiveness of an action over the course of three years is being

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:31.640
required for all actions within the plan. So beginning with the development of the 2024-25

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:39.000
LCAP, LEAs will need to assess whether or not the actions within the plan have proven effective

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:45.560
or ineffective towards meeting that requirement, and if they're ineffective, they have to change

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:52.840
the actions. Now, it's important to note that doesn't mean they have to stop doing an action.

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:58.920
It means that they have to change the action. The action needs to be revised in some way,

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:06.040
shape, or form to allow it to be effective. And so as part of this requirement,

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:17.560
there has to be a description of why the action didn't have, why there was a lack of progress

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:24.360
related to the action, and it also has to include a description of how the changes to the action,

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:30.760
or the new action, is going to result in a strengthened approach. So there's an articulation

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:38.440
of the thought process that's gone into that change that's been made. It's not just something

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:44.840
that's being done in a vacuum without any thought put into it. So the instructions for the LCAP

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:52.280
template have been amended to address these new requirements and include that. In addition,

01:02:53.240 --> 01:03:01.480
the department is proposing to move the location of the goal analysis prompts from where they

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:07.800
currently reside in the template, which is following the actions and services, to a new

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:16.920
position following the measure and reporting outcomes. And the reason is because when an LEA

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:24.920
is coming in to develop its next three-year plan, it's looking at, okay, what are the outcomes

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:29.960
that we've seen over the last three years related to our desired outcome, where we want to be?

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:39.320
Then we're looking at, okay, how did we implement those actions? How effective or ineffective were

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:44.600
those actions? And then that's going to drive the changes that are made to the actions within

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:53.880
the template. So by moving the goal analysis piece from following the goals and actions section

01:03:53.880 --> 01:04:00.440
to preceding the goals and actions section, it really gives readers of the plan a more holistic

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:10.360
look in terms of what thought process and what analysis went into the development of those

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:17.640
actions that are then included in the plan. And then lastly, in terms of the goal analysis,

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:25.800
the department is proposing the inclusion of a stand-alone LCAP annual update template for use

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:35.400
when developing the 2024-25 LCAP. And the reason for this is because as part of the annual update

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:44.920
process, LEAs are having to go back and to report out their expected outcomes for the 2023-24 school

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:51.160
year. They're having to report out on the goals and actions that are included within their

01:04:52.520 --> 01:05:00.360
2023-24 plan. And so my office put together some mock-ups of what this might look like

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:05.320
within the current template. And we came out with a lot of confusing and really ugly things.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:16.520
Because you'd either have to post the 2023-24 LCAP with your 2024-25 LCAP so that folks could see

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:22.680
one plan and compare it to the other plan. Or you would have to transition the goals and actions

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:30.760
that were implemented in 23-24 into the 24-25 LCAP simply for the purpose of providing the

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:36.600
annual update before getting rid of them the following year. And none of that made a whole

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:42.840
lot of sense. So the cleanest option that we've been able to come up with at this point in time

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:52.120
is to propose this stand-alone template that would be utilized as part of the 2024-25 LCAP

01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:00.920
and then following that would go away. LEAs would then go back to reporting their annual update

01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:08.760
within the LCAP template beginning with the 2025-26 LCAP in the way that they have consistently for

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:15.400
the last two years. This is also an approach that's consistent with the process that we used when we

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:23.880
transitioned from the 2019-20 LCAP template to the 2021-22 LCAP template. We used a stand-alone

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:28.520
annual update template to transition between those two. And it worked fairly well.

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:37.160
We've gotten a number of pieces of feedback on the proposed template. And so there's potentially

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:43.880
some things that we can do in order to kind of further streamline that particular annual update

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:51.640
template. But at this point in time, we feel that that's going to be the most straightforward

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:58.360
way to address that annual update requirement in transitioning between the two, three-year cycles.

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:05.000
The last section of the LCAP is the increased or improved services for foster youth,

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:13.240
English learners, and low-income students. As was previously discussed, Education Code Section

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:23.320
52052 added long-term English learners as a numerically significant subgroup. As part of that,

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:31.000
Education Code Section 52064B3 was amended to clarify that when it comes to the requirement

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:38.200
to increase or improve services for low-income English learner and foster youth students pursuant

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:46.120
to Education Code Section 42238.07, or sorry, .02. No, I was right the first time. It's .07.

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:56.600
Long-term English learners are part of the English learner subgroup, which means

01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:04.680
it's perfectly fine for an LEA to have actions that are increasing or improving services

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:11.080
for long-term English learners, in the same way that it's perfectly fine for an LEA to have

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:17.000
actions that are increasing or improving services specifically for homeless students

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:23.160
who are automatically identified as low-income students. All of that is perfectly fine.

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:30.760
So as part of this new requirement within Ed Code, we've taken the opportunity to call out

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:38.200
a couple of times some specifics around long-term English learners also being part of the English

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:43.480
learner student group when it comes to this requirement to increase or improve services

01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:46.120
for low-income English learner and foster youth students.

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:56.600
There's a couple of additional proposed revisions that we're proposing, one of which is to

01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:02.920
consolidate the data entry table and the total expenditures table within the LCAP action tables

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:08.120
to reduce a little bit of duplication of effort. It just consolidates things a little bit better.

01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:16.280
We're also proposing to revise the wording. If you've looked through the draft in attachment

01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:22.280
three, you'll see some instances where we've broken things out using bullet points, whereas

01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:30.200
before you had a bunch of paragraphs of text, it was relatively easy to lose track of what

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:36.120
the different requirements or what specific student groups were being referred to.

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:42.360
By revising those instructions to break things out into bullet points, we're hoping that it

01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:49.960
will not only help to improve the clarity for the readers, but also ensure that everything is being

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:57.000
addressed in the way that it's supposed to be. At this point in time, what I'd actually like to do

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:05.480
is to switch gears and pull up attachment three itself and kind of walk through some of the big

01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:13.480
picture or high point items that are in there. For the sake of brevity, I'm not going to go into

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:19.240
all of the individual proposed changes relating to wording or things like that, but I want to

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:26.600
make you aware of and draw your attention to a number of things. You can follow along with

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:30.920
attachment three. Again, if the track changes scare you, you can look at attachment four,

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:37.880
but this will allow us to kind of walk through and allow you to visualize

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:41.880
what these changes are within the template and the instructions.

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:52.200
So beginning with the plan summary, you can see that our proposal here is to change the reflections

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:59.080
for successes and reflections on identified need into the reflections on annual performance

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:04.200
and the reflections on technical assistance. This is consistent with education code.

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:13.000
Annual performance will be where an LEA will describe both successes and challenges. It will

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:22.840
also describe the particular connection between the performance on the dashboard and also including

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:31.800
local data and identify how the LEA is doing overall. In addition, there's some additional

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:36.600
things that we're calling out as part of the instructions, and so I'll save that for later.

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:42.760
Reflections on technical assistance is what we're proposing in order to address the requirement

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:50.520
that LEAs that are eligible for technical assistance specifically summarize how that

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:55.320
technical assistance is being provided in the process that's underway there.

01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:02.040
For LEAs that are not eligible for technical assistance, they're simply going to identify

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:07.400
that this is not applicable and move on. And you can see that we're proposing to

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:17.000
remove the LCAP highlights prompt within the plan summary piece. This does not remove

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:24.440
an LEA's ability from calling out or highlighting particular things within the plan. They still have

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:31.960
the option based on the flexibility of the template to address, to call out highlights,

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:36.760
things that they really want the community to know about either in the general information section

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:42.520
of the plan or within the annual performance section of the plan. They can call that out.

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:50.920
What this is doing is it's simply removing one more place for LEAs to have to provide verbiage.

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:55.160
It's seeking to streamline that requirement within the template.

01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:02.680
Moving into the engaging educational partners section, here our recommendation is to remove

01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:07.640
the second prompt, the summary of the feedback provided by specific educational partners.

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:16.680
This is not specifically required by statute. As part of the requirement in the third prompt,

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:22.040
description of how engagement with educational partners influenced the development of the

01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:30.200
adopted LCAP, LEAs still have the flexibility to be able to call out specific feedback provided

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:37.880
by educational partners and how that then was used to make changes or additions to the template

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:44.200
and the instructions. It allows them to be able to continue to do that if they want to.

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:53.720
In terms of the goals and actions section, one of the proposals that we're making is to add in

01:13:54.520 --> 01:14:02.520
a field to identify the state priorities that are addressed by the goal. It's required that an LEA

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:08.680
address all applicable state priorities within its LCAP. This simply provides a place and a mechanism

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:15.400
for LEAs to be able to identify for their educational partners what state priority or priorities

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:20.760
they're addressing within a particular goal so that folks can see, okay, within this particular

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:27.320
goal, they're looking to address parent and family engagement, they're looking to address

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:34.600
school climate, they're looking to address student achievement, and to be able to make

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:42.760
those connections with a particular goal. As has already been noted, we're proposing to move the

01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:49.160
goal analysis to follow the measurement reporting results section. And then within the increased

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:54.600
or improved services section, we have a couple of minor wording adjustments adding the word total

01:14:54.600 --> 01:15:00.600
so that it's clear that the total projected LCFF supplemental and concentration grants includes the

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:07.640
projected additional 15% LCFF concentration grant. And you can also see there under the first of the

01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:14.120
required descriptions that long-term English learners have been called out as being part of

01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:21.000
the English learner student group as relates to the requirement to increase or improve services

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:26.040
for low-income English learner and foster youth students. So those are the changes that are being

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:33.160
proposed for the template itself. So then moving into the instructions, and again, the instructions

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:42.600
are where the vast majority of the meat of the LCAP is, if you will. So the other thing that I

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:51.800
want to point out here is that the template itself, this word document portion of the template itself

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:59.080
is not changing size. It remains seven pages. There's no changes to that.

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:05.720
What is increasing in size are the instructions. And part of the reason that the instructions are

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:12.280
increasing in size is not due to additional requirements that are being added. It's due to

01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:20.040
the reformatting of the instructions to include bullet point lists or bullet points rather than

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:25.960
paragraphs. So obviously, inherent within that process, you're going to add space to the document.

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:31.240
So when you're looking at, oh, the template's increasing in size,

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:39.640
it's not increasing in size due to an increase in the content. So the first thing that I want

01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:48.200
to draw your attention to is the comprehensive strategic planning and this inclusion of this

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:54.040
new phrase related to addressing and reducing disparities in opportunities and outcomes

01:16:54.600 --> 01:17:01.000
between student groups indicated by this California school dashboard. That's, again,

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.880
a new statutory requirement as part of the LCAP, the template and the instructions. That's something

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:12.200
that we've woven in a number of times throughout the instructions to ensure that it's clear to

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:18.520
LEAs that there needs to be this focus on addressing and reducing disparities based on

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:27.160
dashboard performance. Moving further down, you can see that long-term English learners have been

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:33.720
called out, again, similar to what we just talked about in the increased or improved services prompt.

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:41.960
Also, we've added this specific note within the piece on establishing goals,

01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:47.800
supporting actions, and related expenditures that address statutory priority areas and statutory

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:56.920
required metrics to identify that long-term English learners are a new numerically significant

01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:03.640
subgroup within education code and that that subgroup is 15 students. So identifying that

01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:10.840
clearly within the instructions. And then also adding that there's needs to, that the template

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:16.280
and instructions, the LCAP, needs to ensure that those increased or improved services

01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:21.320
that are described within the plan, that all of those are reflected within the LCAP.

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:33.560
I'd also like to note just briefly here the inclusion of the word must and the deletion

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:41.320
of the word should. Again, this is getting back to how LEAs must use the dashboard data

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:48.120
in order to help prioritize how it is that their goals, their actions, their services within the

01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:57.640
plan. So then moving to the plan summary and specifically within the successes on,

01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:04.600
the reflections on annual performance. Here you can see that LEAs are being asked to reflect on

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:11.080
the annual performance on dashboard and local data. And LEAs are also, again, provided the

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:17.480
flexibility to address successes and challenges that are identified. In addition to this, LEAs,

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:25.240
the proposal here is to require LEAs to identify any school in the LEA that's received the lowest

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:30.040
performance levels on the dashboard, any student group within the LEA that's received the lowest

01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:34.520
performance levels on the dashboard, or any student group within the LEA that's received the

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:38.760
lowest performance levels on the dashboard. The other thing that you might notice here is that

01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:46.360
we specifically refer to the 2023 dashboard. This is not because we want to bring this back to you

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:54.280
every year and have you revise that year. This is because the statute requires that those actions,

01:19:54.280 --> 01:20:02.920
that the actions that are driven by these three identified groups be consistent for the three

01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:11.000
years of the plan, acknowledging the fact that it takes a while for change to be accomplished

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:18.920
within an educational system. And so not wanting to have an LEA implement an action one year,

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:23.240
then based on changes on the dashboard to have to then change that action,

01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:31.560
get rid of that action, add in new actions the following year. The statute has outlined is that

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:40.120
based on the performance on the 2023 dashboard, LEAs are going to create specific actions

01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:47.160
for the student groups and schools that are lowest performing. Those will be implemented for three

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:56.520
years, unless the LEA as part of its annual update process, as part of its goal analysis,

01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:03.160
determines that those specific actions haven't been effective. If they determine that the actions

01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:09.960
haven't been effective, they can then revise those actions to ensure that they are being effective.

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:15.880
Because at the end of the day, what we want to see is actions that are being effective in helping

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:23.720
students make progress and helping LEAs to achieve their goals. So these actions would be in place

01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:35.800
for the next three years, 2024-25 through 2026-27. And at the end of that, there would be the

01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:42.280
assessment of effectiveness to see, okay, have these been effective? If they haven't, then we

01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:47.960
have to change them. If they have, we can continue to implement them and maintain them.

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:53.320
Again, that does not get rid of an LEA's flexibility to be able to change them

01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:57.800
midstream if they identify that the actions have not been effective.

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:05.400
You can also see as part of that instruction that LEAs are encouraged to highlight how they're

01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:10.920
addressing the identified needs of student groups and or schools within the LCAP as part of the

01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:17.640
response. In terms of the instructions related to the reflections on technical assistance,

01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:23.240
LEAs need to provide that summary of the technical assistance that's underway.

01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:32.760
Again, there's specific requirements in here if an LEA is not eligible for technical assistance,

01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:39.960
identified as not applicable. So then when we get to engaging educational partners,

01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:44.280
here's one of the areas that you can really see how the formatting has changed, specifically

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:50.520
calling out the specific student groups that school districts, county offices, and charter

01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:55.400
schools need to consult with as part of the development of the plan. It also specifically

01:22:55.400 --> 01:23:03.160
calls out both for school districts, county offices, and charter schools that for those

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:09.560
schools receiving LCFF equity multiplier funding, they have to consult with the educational partners

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:15.560
at the schools that are generating those funds in the development of the LCAP and specifically in

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:20.680
the development of the required focus goal for each of those applicable schools so that it's

01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:26.680
clear to everybody that the educational partner voice from those schools needs to be reflected

01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:35.000
within the development of that particular goal. One of the other things that we're proposing to do

01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:42.920
is to add in some hyperlinks to information for folks. So we've added in three hyperlinks

01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:47.960
for school districts, county offices, and charter schools to link them specifically to the

01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:55.640
requirements for the process that the LEAs have to go through prior to the adoption of the LCAP.

01:23:56.200 --> 01:24:03.000
This is different than the legal requirement for LEAs to consult with certain groups in the

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:10.680
development of the LCAP. These are additional opportunities for engagement and for input from

01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:24.120
the local community prior to the adoption of the LCAP template. Then within the engaging educational

01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:32.520
partners section within the prompts, you can see that within prompt one, there's again a reminder

01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:39.080
about consulting with the educational partners at schools that are generating LCFF equity multiplier

01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:47.160
funds. And then we're proposing to remove prompt two. And then prompt three is describing how

01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:52.120
engagement with educational partners influence the development of the adopted LCAP.

01:24:53.560 --> 01:25:01.400
As part of this, there's one thing that we need to revise, which is to remove this piece that says

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:11.800
described in prompt two, since prompt two is going away. Basically, what this provides LEAs with the

01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:17.000
opportunity to do is make those connections between the feedback that's been provided

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:23.080
and how that has helped shape the goals, actions, and services within the LCAP template.

01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:30.680
LEAs continue to maintain the flexibility that they have to call those things out within this prompt.

01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:35.000
So then moving on

01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:49.400
specifically here to the required focus goals for LEAs receiving LCFF equity multiplier funding.

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:54.200
So these are the instructions that we're proposing to add related to this new requirement

01:25:54.200 --> 01:26:02.520
that an LEA that has LCFF equity multiplier funded schools having to include a specific

01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:10.440
focus goal within the LCAP related to those schools. It calls that requirement out and then

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:18.360
it goes into what those goals must address. And as previously stated, all student groups that have

01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:22.920
the lowest performance level on one or more of the state indicators within the dashboard

01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:28.200
has to be addressed as well as any underlying issues in credentialing subject matter preparation

01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:35.640
and retention of the school's educators if it's applicable. So both of those aspects need to be

01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:42.680
called out. One of the things that's important to notice here is related to the underlying issues

01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:47.400
of credentialing subject matter preparation and retention of the school's educators is the phrase

01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:58.200
if applicable. The intention here is not to put everybody in the state on the same level and

01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:05.160
specifically when we're talking about our court and community school programs that are operated

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:14.200
by county offices of education. If you're probably aware, the majority of those programs use local

01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:27.640
assignment options. So those local assignment options within that LEA are going to be comparable

01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:35.000
between the different schools that that program operates. It's not saying compare your program

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:41.560
to a regular K-12 program and explain any discrepancies that are in there. It's looking

01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:48.440
at each LEA on an LEA by LEA basis looking at each school within the LEA on a school by school basis.

01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:59.960
You can see here that this is the area where there was the previous requirement for the

01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:05.720
required goals for consistently low-performing students and consistently low-performing schools.

01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:12.600
That's being taken out because of the change in ed code. When we get to the measure instructions

01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:18.680
for the measure and reporting results piece, you can see the required metrics for LEA-wide actions.

01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:24.280
Again, these are for those contributing actions that are being provided on an LEA-wide basis,

01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:31.960
how they have to be specific metrics, one or more specific metrics to assess the progress and the

01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:38.280
effectiveness of those actions. This is one of the three places within the instructions

01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:43.800
that this is called out. Again, providing the LEAs with flexibility of how this is addressed.

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:54.600
We have also added in a we're proposing to revise the definition or the description of the metric

01:28:55.160 --> 01:29:03.320
to specify that we that LEAs need to identify the standard of measure that's being used to

01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:08.760
determine progress towards the goals and or to measure the effectiveness or one or more of the

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:15.640
actions associated with the goal. We feel that that's more specific than

01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:19.640
indicate how progress is being measured using a metric.

01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:33.400
So, then the goal analysis piece here is largely unchanged. It's been moved, obviously, but the

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:39.960
changes that come within this are specifically within the third prompt and where we're describing

01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:45.240
the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the specific actions in making progress towards the

01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:51.000
goal. Effectiveness means the degree to which the actions were successful in producing the desired

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:58.840
result. That would be that expected outcome that's there. Ineffectiveness means the actions did not

01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:09.240
produce any significant or desired result. Then going into LEAs assessing the effectiveness,

01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:15.960
that assessment of effectiveness can occur based on one metric or it can be done based on a group

01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:23.800
of metrics. But there needs to be metrics that are associated with the actions within the plan

01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:30.040
so that folks are able to track whether or not those actions are being effective in making

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:37.320
progress towards the goal. And then also adding in the new requirement that beginning with the

01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:44.280
development of the 2024-25 LCAP, LEAs must change actions that have not proven effective

01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:49.640
over a three-year period, including the description of the reasons for the ineffectiveness

01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:53.720
and how the changes to the action will result in a newer strengthened approach.

01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:05.640
When we get into actions, we're adding in again the instructions related to

01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:13.240
how an LEA that wants to identify those specific metrics for contributing LEA-wide actions would

01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:21.400
do that. And then we've added a new heading in here for required actions because previously

01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:26.200
there were required actions for 30 or more English learners. Now there's three different

01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:31.960
types of required actions. The first of which is LEAs with 30 or more English learners

01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:39.880
and or 15 or more long-term English learners must include specific actions within the LCAP.

01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:47.560
Those actions have to at a minimum relate to the English language acquisition programs provided

01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:53.320
to students and professional development for teachers that are working with those students.

01:31:53.880 --> 01:32:00.760
And then we're also proposing to add in the additional instruction that if an LEA has both

01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:06.520
30 or more English learners and 15 or more long-term English learners, the LEA must include

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:12.440
actions for both English learners and long-term English learners. And that's because, as we're

01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:19.000
all aware, English learners and long-term English learners have different needs. And so it's important

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:25.240
to address the needs of both groups in order to improve outcomes for both groups. So that's

01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:32.120
specifically in there. The second type of required action, as has already been

01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:37.080
spoken about briefly, is that for LEAs that are eligible for technical assistance

01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:43.560
and how they have to have actions, specific actions in there to implement the work underway

01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:50.120
as part of technical assistance. So really drawing that connection between the work that's going on

01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:56.120
as part of the technical assistance process. And again, most of the time, that's going to be

01:32:56.120 --> 01:33:04.680
differentiated assistance with the things that are being done within the LCAP in order to achieve

01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:11.880
the goals that the LEA has developed. And then the third type of required goal are for those LEAs that

01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:19.560
have the lowest performance level for a school within the LEA, a student group within the LEA,

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:25.960
or a student group within a school within the LEA. And again, going back to what we discussed

01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:31.480
earlier, these actions are intended to be in place for three years unless the LEA determines

01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:41.400
that they've been ineffective. And those actions are going to then be assessed at the end of that

01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:54.040
three-year period. And then the last of the changes within the instructions that we're proposing

01:33:54.680 --> 01:34:05.800
is this note related to long-term English learners being part of the English learner student group

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:13.160
for purposes of increasing or improving services and that requirement. And so that particular note

01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:21.080
has been added again to help LEAs remind LEAs that those actions that are being used to increase or

01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:25.800
improve services for English learners can also be used to increase or improve services for long-term

01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:35.160
English learners. And then the last, again, this is just the third and final place where we're

01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:43.400
providing instructions for an LEA to identify if it's choosing to identify the specific metrics

01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:48.600
that it's using for those contributing LEA-wide actions. This is providing them with the

01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:54.520
instruction of how they would do it within this section of the plan. That really brings us to the

01:34:54.520 --> 01:35:05.880
end of the major revisions to the template and the instructions. And so with that I will see

01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:08.600
if there are any questions.

01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:14.840
You're not allowed to ask a question.

01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:26.360
No, I want to thank you so much, Josh. That was very clear rendering of a very complicated

01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:36.440
situation. So we're going to open the phone line for public comment queue. And we'll put up that

01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:42.600
slide if we can. Then I'll get comments from our liaisons. If there are clarifying questions,

01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:48.200
we will take those. Before we go to public comment, I'm going to call a break so that we

01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:54.600
can really be alert and ready to listen carefully to our public comment because this is a long item,

01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:59.320
as you know, and an important one. And we thank you very much, Josh, for all of the work that

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:07.720
went into the revised template. We know it was an enormous undertaking. So we're opening the phone

01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:12.680
line for public comment. Members of the public wishing to provide comment can do so in person

01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:17.240
or by calling the telephone number and using the access code provided on the slide that's shown now.

01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:22.440
While we're waiting for members of the public to queue up and get ready to speak,

01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:27.240
I do want to ask our liaison, Vice President Glover-Woods, if she has any initial comments

01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:32.600
before me, then if there are clarifying questions, we'll go to those before we take a quick break.

01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:40.280
Thank you. And thank you, Josh, for just a very thorough walkthrough of all of the changes. And

01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:46.200
I know there were quite a few changes that had to take place as a result of the legislation and

01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:51.880
other pieces. And again, thank you for the walkthrough as well as the markup and non-markup

01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:58.200
versions of the attachments. I think just in my general framing comments, and I'm going to save

01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:03.160
other comments after we take a break and come back and hear public comment, but

01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:12.920
I think what is quite evident is there's been a lot of work reiterating this particular document.

01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:20.360
And as it has evolved, if you will, over the time period, I think what we're seeing is that there

01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:28.760
are more pieces that have been included to really ensure LEAs take the time necessary

01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:37.880
to address the very specific student needs in their population. And as a result of legislation

01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:46.280
and other pieces, there are areas now where it's very, very clear that these areas do have to be

01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:53.160
addressed and called out in goals, actions, and services. And while it creates quite the robust

01:37:53.160 --> 01:38:00.520
document, and again, I'll save my comment on that after we come back from break, I hope that it puts

01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:05.880
to bed kind of some of the myths that may have been out there on what student groups can be

01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:11.960
addressed or cannot be addressed in the LCAP, particularly African-American students or others,

01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:18.280
because again, it's very, very clear that if student performance on the dashboard is not at

01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:23.880
the level that is what we would all expect, there has to be something addressed in here.

01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:30.680
Outside of that, as I said, I'll hold some of my other comments until we come back,

01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:35.960
but I again thank the department for the work that has been done. As we're in iteration, I'm

01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:43.880
not sure which of the LCAP template, and let's see where we may need to go going forward. Thank you.

01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:51.160
And I'll just add to that that I appreciate that you've done a wonderful job of being on a tight

01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:57.560
rope between simplifying and trying to shorten the LCAP. We've had a lot of requests for that,

01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:04.200
you know, from the field to make it understandable and useful as well as doable, while also diving

01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:12.920
in on long-term English learners and students who are in need of particular supports of various

01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:21.560
kinds. And so, you know, I think that we're all appreciative of the work, and nobody's head exploded,

01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:28.040
so that's a good sign that we're off to a good discussion shortly. Yes.

01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:36.040
Yes, and I am going to go now to clarifying questions, and then we'll take a little break

01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:38.680
before we hear public comment. Yes, go ahead, please.

01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:49.160
Thank you. Josh, just one clarifying question at this point. As it relates to the LCFF equity

01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:55.640
multiplier goals, I know that it's very clearly stated that there do need to be goals in the

01:39:55.640 --> 01:40:02.360
template for addressing the schools that are receiving those dollars and individual goals

01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:12.040
for each school. Okay. Is there a specific way that has to be identified in the template? So,

01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:19.240
for an example, if I'm a member of the community and I open the LCAP for a particular district,

01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:27.000
can I easily identify in the goals section which goals are specific to the LCFF

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:33.720
equity multiplier funds and which goals are not specifically tied to those funds?

01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:43.800
So, can I take down the public comment slide?

01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:48.280
Do you need to put up another slide? Yes, you may.

01:40:51.480 --> 01:41:05.880
So, if we go back to the instructions as part of the plan summary within the general information.

01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:08.680
Josh, can you tell me what page you're on so I can follow? Thank you.

01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:19.400
Let me. We are on the top of page 22.

01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:31.560
So, as part of the requirements within the general information section, we've added the requirement

01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:39.400
that an LEA needs to identify any schools within the LEA that's receiving LCFF equity multiplier

01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:46.040
funding. So, first of all, as part of the plan summary, it's going to be clear to everybody

01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:51.800
who's reading the plan what schools are receiving those funds. That way they'll know what schools

01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:58.840
there need to be specific goals for. Then, when it comes to the actual goal itself,

01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:09.080
as part of the description of how the LEA or why the LEA has developed the goal,

01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:18.120
the LEA would be identifying here that this particular school is receiving LCFF equity

01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:23.960
multiplier funds pursuant to, I can't quote the education code off the top of my head,

01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:31.320
but, and so this goal is specifically addressed, is specifically being included to address that

01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:36.600
requirement. Okay, and that's clear in the instructions as well, that they need to use

01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:44.760
that language in that box. Thank you. Are there any other clarifying questions?

01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:49.960
We're going to have discussion questions later. Yes, Member Tauri.

01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:55.480
Thank you. I have a clarifying question on something sort of related to what you asked.

01:42:55.480 --> 01:43:05.080
On slide 15, you mentioned section 52064E7, which was the equity multiplier list of schools

01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:13.800
needing to have that focus goal. Is anything in, to clarify, is anything we put in the LCAP template

01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:20.600
an interpretation of that ed code, or do you feel that what's in the template is

01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:27.640
purely specified in the statute? And I'm asking, you gave the example of a district that has 15

01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:32.840
schools. There are bigger districts that have more than 15 schools that are going to have to add,

01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:39.960
you know, several schools in here. And each school does their school plan,

01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:45.880
single plan for student achievement, which most people in the community and family members

01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:49.800
are going to be interested in one or two schools or three schools that their individual children

01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:55.320
are at, and would want to look maybe more closely at that particular school's goals.

01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:58.600
So I'm asking the, just clarifying question, whether it's interpretation or...

01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:04.200
So currently what's included within the template and the instructions related to the

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:12.920
LCFF equity multiplier goal requirement is only what is required in statute.

01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:19.480
So there is a specific requirement that says for each school that is receiving LCFF equity

01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:28.440
multiplier funds, there must be a goal in the LCAP. Thank you.

01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:33.560
All right. Member Olken, did you have your finger up for a moment? Or are you going to save it till

01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:40.120
later? I can save it. Thank you. Any other clarifying questions? All right. Let's just

01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:46.520
take a five minute break so that we can be fresh and ready for our public comment. We'll return at

01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:57.320
10 47. We will now take public comment on this item. Are there any speakers signed up to provide

01:44:57.320 --> 01:45:06.600
public comment in person? Yes, we have five people who are signed up to provide public

01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:11.640
comment in person. Could we have the following people please line up at the microphone in the

01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:19.160
back of the room? Kimber Sargent, Shelly Spiegel Coleman, Shannon O'Brien, Jessica Sacco, and

01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:21.800
Lindsay Tornatore. Thank you.

01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:38.520
Yeah, please begin and please be sure and give us your name and affiliation for the record.

01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:44.120
Is that mic on?

01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:49.640
Just be sure you use your outdoor voice. Okay. Kimber Sargent, San Bernardino City Unified

01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:54.840
School District. Good morning, President, Dr. Darling-Hammond, and members of the board.

01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:59.640
I'd like to express my gratitude to the state board's commitment for improving and refining

01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:05.080
the LCAP template to meet the requirements of the statutes. I'd also like to thank Mr.

01:46:05.080 --> 01:46:10.360
Joshua Strong and his team for the support and improvement of the refinement process.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:15.640
For the support and improvement of the refinement process, I asked the board to consider the

01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:25.640
methodology for including equity multiplier funds as individual goals. As Mr. Strong mentioned in

01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:31.480
his presentation, some districts will be heavily impacted by this requirement. For our district,

01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:37.640
this will take our plan from three goals to 21 goals. Further, we ask that you consider the

01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:43.720
methodology of including actions for each area, demonstrating the lowest performance on the

01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:51.000
California dashboard for the district and at the school level and at the school level and the

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:54.120
student group level. Your time is up. Thank you.

01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:07.160
Good morning, board member, President Linda Darling-Hammond, Chief Deputy Officer Mary

01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:13.480
Nicely, and board members. Shelly Spiegel-Coleman from Californians Together and a grateful member

01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:19.800
on the LCAP advisory group. There is a sentence in the LCAP template which has not changed from

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:27.800
the last three-year LCAP. The sentence on page 27 reads, LEAs are encouraged to identify metrics

01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:34.280
for specific subgroups as appropriate, including expected outcomes that would reflect the narrowing

01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:39.720
of any existing performance gaps. Californians Together and the Center for Equity for English

01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:47.080
Learners have read LCAPs four times, and in our last report, we found that only five districts

01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:54.040
out of 26 had included desired outcomes for English learners. Just encouraging districts

01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:59.640
to have metrics to close gaps is not enough. We urge the board to follow the governor's intent

01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:06.200
in SB 114 to address disparities and go beyond encouragement by inserting the word shall

01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:11.560
so that metrics with aspirational growth are there for all districts. Thank you.

01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:20.840
Good morning, and thank you to Board President Darling-Hammond and members for the opportunity

01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:25.880
to comment. I'm Shannon O'Brien with Alameda County Office of Education. We review and approve

01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:30.440
LCAPs for 18 districts in our county. I want to highlight a few key points from our written

01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:35.480
comments. First, we believe that narrative response boxes could be replaced with tables

01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:40.600
in some sections of the LCAP. Narrative makes the LCAP longer. Tables would help summarize

01:48:40.600 --> 01:48:45.560
information and would also be more reader-friendly for families. Second, like others, we recommend

01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:50.600
deleting prompts not explicitly required by statute. We also believe there are some areas

01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:55.400
where fields could be inserted to highlight student outcome gaps, lessen the administrative

01:48:55.400 --> 01:49:01.720
burden on our LCAP writers, and support new requirements in SB 114. Lastly, we recommend

01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:07.240
that key requirements be moved out of the instructions and into the LCAP template itself.

01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:12.520
Doing so will help improve LEA responses to the prompt as well as accessibility. Thank you.

01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:21.320
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond, Chief Deputy Nicely, and members of the board. My name

01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:25.560
is Jessica Sacco and I'm here on behalf of Children Now. I would like to thank the CDE

01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:29.560
and state board staff for their engagement with Children Now and the LCFF equity coalition

01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:33.960
throughout the revision of the LCAP template. And I will refer you to the coalition letter

01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:38.680
for our complete comments and recommendations on this item. Specifically regarding the plan

01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:43.880
summary, I urge the board to restore the LCAP highlights section to serve the purpose of an

01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:48.280
executive summary and take up the recommendation of the California Practitionary Advisory Group

01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:53.000
members to include a word limit to avoid making this section too lengthy. Regarding equity

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:57.800
multiplier funding in schools, we recommend the inclusion of a reminder that equity multiplier

01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:03.080
funds must be used to supplement and not supplant LCFF funding. We look forward to

01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:07.800
continuing our dialogue with the board and department as we work on template revisions. Thank you.

01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:17.800
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond, Vice President Glover Woods, and members of the

01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:22.360
board. My name is Lindsay Tornatore on behalf of the California County Superintendents. We would

01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:27.000
like to share our strong support for the CDE's thoughtful recommendations that streamline the

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:32.280
LCAP. We see this streamline through the removal of prompts and tables, reorganization of content,

01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:36.840
and amendments to semantics and the instructions that will increase clarity. Each of these changes

01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:41.800
to the LCAP are improvements that will help LEAs develop a clearer, more concise, and more

01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:46.760
meaningful document to be shared with families and communities. There is a universal theme across

01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:52.440
LEAs that the LCAP in its current form is too complex and redundant, and this redundancy takes

01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:57.240
away from the important information that the LCAP provides, what is actually driving improvement for

01:50:57.240 --> 01:51:02.440
students. In closing, as those who are closest to the work of the LCAP, we ask you to please support

01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:06.360
the CDE's recommendations that will streamline this very important document. Thank you.

01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:12.200
That's all of the in-person comments.

01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:18.040
That is the case. We'll move to the comments on the telephone.

01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:27.000
Okay, I will open the phone line now. Good morning, caller ending in 5596.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:30.760
Please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:39.000
Good morning, Chair Darling-Hammond and members. Liz Guian with Public Advocates. We appreciate the

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:43.960
process and timeline that the department has led for public input. As Josh stated, the budget

01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:49.640
trailer bill makes addressing and reducing disparities a new requirement, no longer an option.

01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:54.760
For us, this means that the LCAP template and instructions should be more helpful for LEAs

01:51:54.760 --> 01:52:00.680
on how to report on specific focus actions along three dimensions, read by district,

01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:05.800
read by school, and read by student groups at a school site, in ways that we've recommended

01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:11.480
in our comments with the Equity Coalition. For LEAs receiving new equity multiplier funding,

01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:17.400
the template and instructions should help them by calling out directions to clearly outline and

01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:23.720
explain focus goals, actions, and spending, and should remind LEAs that equity multiplier funds

01:52:23.720 --> 01:52:29.240
supplement and not supplant other funding. These points are not clear at this point,

01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:35.000
and this was asked for repeatedly, this clarity in the department's webinar. Thank you.

01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:42.920
Thank you. Next caller, ending in 5116. Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:49.640
You have one minute. Your time starts now. Good morning, Connie Choi with Public Advocates

01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:54.920
on behalf of the Equity Coalition. Meaningful community engagement is a core mandate by statute

01:52:54.920 --> 01:53:00.120
that must undergird the entire LCAP process. I'll echo my colleague at Children Now regarding

01:53:00.120 --> 01:53:06.280
re-instituting LCAP highlights in the plan summary. We also recommend enumerating applicable

01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:12.120
committees under engaging educational partners. All LCAP consumers should clearly understand who

01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:17.160
is required to be engaged. This includes parent advisory committees, district English learner

01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:21.000
advisory committees, as well as student committees for district serving middle or high school

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:27.160
students as now required by SB 997 by former Senator Pam. Restoring the insert instruction,

01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:31.400
summarizing partner feedback will also ensure that engagement activities are not simply boxes

01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:37.080
to check. Nearly providing flexibility for LEAs will not suffice. Parents and other stakeholders

01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:41.480
want to see themselves in the document and show that they were heard. Thank you for your consideration.

01:53:42.360 --> 01:53:49.320
Thank you. Next caller ending in 3004. Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:51.080
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:57.800
Good morning, President Darlene Hammond and members of the board. Carlos Machado with

01:53:57.800 --> 01:54:03.080
the California School Board Association. CSBA supports the changes recommended by the CDE

01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:08.680
that help make the LCAP less complex and more accessible. These changes are identified in a

01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:13.240
letter sent to the board by coalition that includes CSBA, other statewide organizations,

01:54:13.240 --> 01:54:18.440
and more than two dozen districts and county offices of education. The proposed changes

01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:22.520
include consolidation and flexibility that together would take an important step in

01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:27.880
streamlining the template. By making the LCAP more accessible, these changes would help improve

01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:33.080
transparency and make the document more accessible and lead to greater local engagement. We ask the

01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:37.000
board to incorporate the CDE proposed revisions into the final template. Thank you.

01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:45.800
Thank you. Next caller ending in 3809. Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:47.640
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:54.520
Good morning, President Darlene Hammond and members of the board. My name is Kimberly Graham

01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:59.560
from the Kern County Superintendent of Schools. Today I voice our strong support for the CDE's

01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:05.480
thoughtful recommendations to streamline the LCAP. The LCAP is a critical tool for our LEAs to provide

01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:10.920
transparency and clarity to our educational partners around goals and priorities. As it stands,

01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:16.120
the LCAP has become overly complex and at times redundant, making it challenging to navigate

01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:22.360
effectively. KCSOS supports the recommendations put forth by the CDE, including consolidation

01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:27.800
of the data entry and total expenditure tables, relocation of the goal analysis prompts, and

01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:33.320
increased clarity in the LCAP instructions. These changes align with the core intent of the LCAP,

01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:38.200
which is to drive improvement for our students through local control based on the philosophic

01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:44.600
principles of subsidiarity. In conclusion, we urge you to embrace these recommendations from the CDE.

01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:48.520
Let's work together to make the LCAP a more efficient and effective tool for the betterment

01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:52.440
of our students and the communities we serve. Thank you for your time and consideration.

01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:58.760
Thank you. Next caller ending in 8169. Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

You have one minute. Your time starts now.

01:56:03.320 --> 01:56:07.400
Good morning, President Darlene Hammond, Vice President Glover Woods, and members of the board.

01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:13.080
I'm Jessica Bonduras from the Santa Clara County Office of Education, here to illustrate that the

01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:19.560
SCCLE supports the CDE's recommendations that streamline the LCAP. The Santa Clara County Office

01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:25.160
of Education is committed to quality supports, programs, and services of students, and streamlining

01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:30.360
the LCAP will allow our county office and the districts we serve to better assess and present

01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:33.640
the actions and services supporting all students served. Thank you.

01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:39.000
Thank you. Next caller ending in 8744. Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:47.320
Good morning, Dr. Darlene Hammond and board members. Diana Zhu on behalf of the Association

01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:51.880
of Calgary School Administrators. Access appreciates and supports CDE's recommendations

01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:56.280
to streamline the LCAP. We believe that the edits, such as removal of the prompts not required in

01:56:56.760 --> 01:57:01.720
will help provide increased clarity for readers. Moreover, we strongly encourage further streamlining

01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:07.640
and simplification of the LCAP so it offers greater flexibility and greater accessibility

01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:13.880
and transparency for communities and education partners. I actually look forward to collaborating

01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:18.600
with the state and other education partners on long-term solutions to the LCAP that will result

01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:22.920
in a meaningful plan to enhance student achievement and increase community engagement. Thank you.

01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:28.760
Thank you. Next caller ending in 7995. Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

You have one minute. Your time starts now.

01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:37.720
Hi, good morning. Patty Chavez from SEAL, a statewide organization partnering with hundreds

01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:42.520
of schools to center ELs and multilingual learners and here today with a collaboration of partners.

01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:47.400
Thank you for your dedication and enhancing ELs in the LCAP template. It doesn't look scary.

01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:51.640
Josh and team, great presentation. It looks wonderfully enhanced to respond to the needs

01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:56.600
of our students, families, and schools. I'd like to uplift specific language in page 22

01:57:56.600 --> 01:58:01.800
under section reflections annual performance, which was highlighted in the presentation.

01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:05.560
We very much appreciate the first three bullets that line out requirements.

01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:11.240
I'd like to focus on the sentence just below that reads encourages districts. That word

01:58:11.240 --> 01:58:18.040
encourage gives the sense that they don't need to necessarily have to highlight that the actions

01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:22.680
actually respond to the need. If we are required to identify groups, which is wonderful,

01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:27.160
we should also require that their actions actually address the needs. It goes hand in hand

01:58:27.160 --> 01:58:32.440
and creates a holistic solution. We urge you to substitute the word encouraged to required

01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:36.200
to read as follows. LEAs are required to highlight how they are addressing.

01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:39.880
Thank you. Within the LCAP. Thank you.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:47.080
Next caller ending in 6764. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one

01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:53.960
minute. Your time starts now. Good morning, President Darling-Hammond and members of the

01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:59.320
State Board of Education. This is Dina Wilson, Director of Accountability Support and Monitoring

01:58:59.320 --> 01:59:04.680
at the Los Angeles County Office of Education. We support the addition of annual update template

01:59:04.680 --> 01:59:09.240
and instructions of separate documents addressing the analysis of goals and actions

01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:15.640
from the 2324 plan. To support streamlining of the LCAP, we recommend that census response to

01:59:15.640 --> 01:59:20.760
the prompts about effectiveness and changes in the annual update address the effectiveness

01:59:20.760 --> 01:59:26.280
or lack thereof of each of action and related changes. But this information does not again

01:59:26.280 --> 01:59:31.400
need to be repeated in the encased or improved services section of the first prompt. Thank you

01:59:31.400 --> 01:59:36.920
very much. Thank you. Next caller ending in 0516. Please state your name and affiliation

01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:42.840
for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now. Good morning,

01:59:42.840 --> 01:59:48.440
Board President Linda Harleen-Hammond. My name is Noemi Valdez. I am a retired early childhood

01:59:48.440 --> 01:59:55.240
education director. I'd like to appreciate the board's efforts in the specific language

01:59:55.240 --> 01:59:59.640
addressing long-term English learners. The inclusion of long-term English learners is a

01:59:59.640 --> 02:00:04.760
significant and important change to the template and to the instructions. We also appreciate

02:00:04.760 --> 02:00:10.120
clarifying language throughout the attachment three, including the notes on page 19 and

02:00:10.120 --> 02:00:16.120
describing the new numerical significance of long-term English learners as a student group

02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:21.000
and the language on page 36, specifically stating that within the required actions,

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:28.200
if LEA has more than 30 or more English language learners or 15 or more long-term English learners,

02:00:28.200 --> 02:00:33.480
the LEA must include actions for both English learners and long-term English learners.

02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:40.840
As an English learner myself and living in a community of many English learners

02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:46.840
and significantly number of long-term English learners, this is a huge step in the right

02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:50.760
direction for our community, for our children, and for our families. Thank you. Thank you.

02:00:58.040 --> 02:01:03.640
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond, members of the board, Deanna McCarty,

02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:08.680
co-chair of the County Operated Student Programs Committee. We wholeheartedly support CD's

02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:13.960
recommendations to streamline the LCAP. The LCAP's original intent was a strategic plan for LEAs,

02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:18.840
but its complexity has deviated from that purpose. CD's proposed revisions aim to simplify and

02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:22.360
enhance transparency, making it accessible for parents and communities. We endorse the

02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:27.400
consolidation of prompts in the plan for engaging educational partner sections. The flexibility for

02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:31.960
LEAs in measuring and reporting results, as well as the consolidation of data entry and total

02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:36.120
expenditures tables, and also the clear formatting and wording and instructions.

02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:39.720
Streamlining the LCAP is not merely about paperwork. It's about fostering transparency

02:01:39.720 --> 02:01:43.400
and community engagement, allowing agencies like ours to better serve our diverse student

02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:48.200
population. These changes will empower parents, educators, and communities to understand fund

02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:52.680
allocation, support students with the highest needs, realign the LCAP with its original purpose,

02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:57.160
and improve transparency for effectively addressing the diverse needs of our students.

02:01:57.800 --> 02:02:03.720
Thank you for your consideration. Thank you. Next caller, ending in 8-3-3-5.

Please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:16.040
Good morning. My name is Jeanie Keyes. I'm with the Los Angeles County Office of Education

02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:21.800
in the LCAP State and Federal Programs Unit. We have two recommendations addressing the new

02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:28.440
requirement for the LCFF equity multiplier funding. We recommend the LCAP template identify

02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:34.840
the schools eligible for this funding, and that the template provides flexibility for LEAs to

02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:40.840
best determine the additional support required at these schools, either in the school plan goals

02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:47.400
or LCAP plan goals. While addressing supplementary actions in a focus goal for a single school or

02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:52.360
small cluster of schools eligible for this funding in the LCAP may be reasonable,

02:02:52.920 --> 02:02:58.120
addressing a separate goal for each eligible school in a large district will create an

02:02:58.120 --> 02:03:04.280
unmanageable document. Identifying the eligible schools and including actions that supplement

02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:10.680
services at school sites in focus goals in school plans would provide transparency and

02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:17.800
accountability for LEAs and their educational partners. Thank you. Next caller, ending in

02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:29.880
now. Good morning, President Darling-Hammond and members of the board. My name is Corey Greenlaw,

02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:34.040
and I'm calling to represent Dr. Michelle Cantwell-Cofer, the Fresno County Superintendent

02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:38.760
of Schools. We are in support of the CDE's recommendations that streamline the LCAP.

02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:43.640
We appreciate the work the CDE and the State Board of Education have dedicated to continuously

02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:48.440
improving the LCAP template to address the needs of all students, and particularly for all

02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:52.920
English learner, foster youth, and low-income students. As you consider further changes today,

02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:58.680
we recommend consideration of the following. LEAs that have equity multiplier identified schools be

02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:04.040
allowed to group multiple schools into a required goal if they have commonly identified needs

02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:07.560
and planned actions in lieu of a separate goal for each school.

02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:12.120
This will help larger LEAs who have dozens of equity multiplier identified schools.

02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:16.280
Lastly, please consider developing an alternative template for county offices of education.

02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:22.200
Thank you very much. Thank you. Next caller, ending in 0-3-0-0. Please state your name

My name is Mary Phil Roman O'Cole from the Monterey County Office of Education.

02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:42.440
Thank you for taking my comment, Chair Darling and board members. The LCAP template does not

02:04:42.440 --> 02:04:50.200
specifically allow a district to include proven carryover as their budget is being presented in

02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:59.960
the plan. We would suggest that allow inclusion of proven carryover either in one of the data

02:04:59.960 --> 02:05:06.360
tables or allow it to be included in the instructions of the goal analysis section

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:12.760
so that the public is aware of how those dollars are being included. Thank you.

Hi. Good morning. My name is Octavio Costello. I'm with the Los Angeles County Office of Education,

02:05:27.560 --> 02:05:32.360
the Director of Business Advisory Services. I'm speaking on support of the recommendation

02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:37.240
of the recommended changes to the LCAP template. Since its inception, one of the primary objectives

02:05:37.240 --> 02:05:41.720
of the LCAP has been transparency between local educational agencies and their parent and community

02:05:41.720 --> 02:05:46.120
partners. Understanding the complexities of a district or charter schools operations and

02:05:46.120 --> 02:05:49.640
finance can be overbearing for those not entrenched in the day-to-day activities.

02:05:50.280 --> 02:05:55.080
The revisions being proposed to the LCAP will enable local educational agencies to share

02:05:55.080 --> 02:05:58.840
their continuous improvement plans in an understandable manner while remaining

02:05:59.800 --> 02:06:05.240
steadfast to the LCAP's objective of transparency. As reviewers, the consolidation of the data entry

02:06:05.240 --> 02:06:10.360
tables and the total expenditure table is logical and further aids in the analysis and assessment

02:06:10.360 --> 02:06:14.920
of the LCAP. I strongly encourage the State Board of Education to improve the proposed changes to

02:06:14.920 --> 02:06:21.480
the LCAP template. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller ending in 2331, please state your name

Good morning, Chair and members. Laura Wasco on behalf of the Orange County Department of

02:06:31.720 --> 02:06:36.600
Education. We would like to thank the Department of Education and the State Board of Education staff

02:06:37.160 --> 02:06:42.680
for their partnership and engagement in revising the LCAP. We support the recommendations and the

02:06:42.680 --> 02:06:48.360
revisions that will streamline and simplify the LCAP, and we believe that these proposed revisions

02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:54.440
will make the template more transparent and more accessible for parents, families, and communities.

02:06:54.440 --> 02:07:00.120
Thank you for all your hard work. Thank you. Next caller ending in 6645,

Hello, President Erling Hammond and members of the board. My name is Deborah Gorgulo,

02:07:11.080 --> 02:07:15.960
assistant superintendent of Santa Clara County Office of Education. We strongly support the

02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:21.960
recommendation to streamline the LCAP. The LCAP must be comprehensible for all community partners.

02:07:21.960 --> 02:07:27.720
The removal of redundancy, clarifying instructions, and continuing to address the concerns of LCAP

02:07:27.720 --> 02:07:33.000
riders will assist in creating a meaningful plan that will guide quality instruction for our

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:39.640
students. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller ending in 6647, please state your name and affiliation

02:07:39.640 --> 02:07:42.200
for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

02:07:45.080 --> 02:07:49.960
Leticia Garcia on behalf of Riverside County Superintendent of Schools. We're part of a

02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:54.520
coalition of education management leaders in support of staff's proposed revisions to the

02:07:54.520 --> 02:08:00.360
LCAP. We believe the changes to streamline and simplify the LCAP template are a step in the

02:08:00.360 --> 02:08:05.480
right direction. However, we also believe that more needs to be done to further simplify the

02:08:05.480 --> 02:08:10.840
template and return it to its original intended goal for the LCAP to be a strategic planning

02:08:10.840 --> 02:08:17.000
document. We welcome the opportunity to move away from one size fits approaches where every

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:22.680
district in the state uses the same template. In Riverside County, our smallest district with 28

02:08:22.680 --> 02:08:29.320
students uses the same template as our largest district with over 50,000 students, which in both

02:08:29.320 --> 02:08:36.440
cases results in lengthy LCAP plans that are incomprehensible to all LEA partners. We know

02:08:36.440 --> 02:08:42.040
that many of these changes require legislative efforts, and as a coalition of education

02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:47.480
management leaders, we are committed to engaging with educational partners to achieve this goal.

02:08:47.480 --> 02:08:52.680
Thank you. Thank you. Next caller ending in 2669, please state your name and affiliation

02:08:52.680 --> 02:08:58.760
for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now. Good morning. President Darling-Hammond,

02:08:58.760 --> 02:09:02.920
Vice President Glover Woods, and members of the board. My name is Karen Strong, and I'm the LCAP

02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:07.400
director for San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools. As you can probably guess by my title,

02:09:07.400 --> 02:09:11.240
one of my primary responsibilities is working with local districts and developing and reviewing

02:09:11.240 --> 02:09:15.800
their LCAPs. In this role, I have worked with district leaders in all 33 of our school districts

02:09:15.800 --> 02:09:20.200
and in many of our 51 charter schools as they seek to provide transparent, cohesive LCAPs

02:09:20.200 --> 02:09:24.360
focused on student needs. In a large diverse county where school districts ranges sizes from

02:09:24.360 --> 02:09:29.640
less than 100 students to over 55,000 students, a statewide template must provide flexibility

02:09:29.640 --> 02:09:34.120
suitable to each local context. We also recognize that the board and department must strike a

02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:39.000
delicate balance between amending the template and maintaining statutory requirements. We applaud CDE

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:43.400
and LASO's efforts to listen to those closest to the work and make significant revisions to reduce

02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:48.120
redundancy and improve clarity. We support these revisions and acknowledge that these changes

02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:52.600
represent the voices of hundreds of educators, parents, and community members. Thank you.

02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:58.840
Thank you. Next caller ending in 9519. Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

Good morning. Andrew Person with the Parent Institute for Quality Education.

02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:12.520
As a community-based organization empowering over 20,000 families annually across the state to

02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:17.240
support their children's education, including by engaging in their local LCAP process, we appreciate

02:10:17.240 --> 02:10:22.280
the language included specifying the requirement for a superintendent to respond in writing to the

02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:27.560
recommendations of advisory committees. While this language is not new, it has been our experience

02:10:27.560 --> 02:10:32.120
that many DLAC committees do not receive this response from their superintendent and therefore

02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:37.000
do not know whether their recommendations will be included in the final LCAP before it goes to their

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:45.880
board. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller ending in 4270. Please state your name and affiliation

Thank you. Good morning. Lee Angela Reed on behalf of the Small School Districts Association.

02:10:55.880 --> 02:11:02.040
I want to echo the comments by my colleagues in education management and I want to reiterate

02:11:02.680 --> 02:11:08.040
the statements made in our coalition letter. We very much appreciate and support the recommendations

02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:15.560
of CDE to streamline the LCAP process. The number one goal of our districts is to be accountable to

02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:21.400
our communities and for that to happen, the document, the LCAP must be meaningful. We must

02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:26.440
go back to what we were the original intent of the LCAP and we look forward to working with

02:11:26.440 --> 02:11:31.320
board and department staff to do so and if legislation is necessary to pursuing that.

02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:36.040
Thank you again for the changes and we think it's definitely a step in the right direction.

02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:42.920
Thank you. Next caller ending in 4369. Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

calling from San Diego County. I represent the California Association for Bilingual Education

02:11:55.400 --> 02:12:02.520
or CABE and as part of the LCFF Equity Coalition. We greatly appreciate the work that has been done

02:12:02.520 --> 02:12:08.280
on this item. While we acknowledge and appreciate that long-term English learners are referenced in

02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:14.600
various sections of the LCAP, we have a small request that this numerically significant subgroup

02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:21.000
be inserted on page 8 of attachment 3 with the language, quote, including long-term English

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:26.680
learners, end quote, under the second highlighted descriptor consistent with the language in the

02:12:26.680 --> 02:12:33.800
first descriptor on the same page as Josh stated in his excellent presentation. Thank you in advance

02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:51.000
This is Suzanne Cooey from the Charter Schools Development Center. Good morning, members of the

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:56.680
board. We appreciate the important names of the LCAP and the excellent efforts of CDE staff to

02:12:56.680 --> 02:13:03.400
manage the overly complex constraints of statutes. We reiterate that for small LEAs,

02:13:03.400 --> 02:13:08.840
the process diverts far too much time from teaching and learning with no guarantee of

02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:15.320
added value. We hope state leaders will push for legislation for a differentiated process

02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:25.320
by LEA size and performance. We further express concerns about the availability of data

02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:32.120
for LEAs to analyze effectiveness of specific actions. In particular, the dashboard indicators

02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:38.040
themselves have layers of validity issues that we need to prioritize addressing. And also,

02:13:38.040 --> 02:13:44.440
they're oriented to identifying equity gaps, not to analyzing where growth is happening.

02:13:46.040 --> 02:13:52.520
California has tremendous opportunity to give LEAs helpful data that is oriented toward improvement.

02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:58.920
And we need to create that information available to LEAs now. Thank you so much.

02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:02.920

Good morning, President Darling-Hammond and members of the board. My name is Martin Peroli,

02:14:14.440 --> 02:14:18.520
representing the Tulare County Office of Education and Superintendent Tim Heyer.

02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:26.280
We support CDE's recommendations to consolidate the LCAP template and instructions. Tulare County

02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:31.640
is home to 43 school districts, of which 30 are single school districts operating under one or

02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:38.360
two administrators and their boards. A streamlined plan will help districts with the process of

02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:43.480
continuous improvement by unifying parts of the plan and giving districts greater flexibility

02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:49.480
in how their strategic plans are laid out. Additionally, streamlining the LCAP could

02:14:49.480 --> 02:14:54.520
greatly help in making these plans accessible to all community members in our county.

02:14:55.720 --> 02:15:00.920
We believe firmly in the importance of the LCAP and more importantly, in the process of the LCAP

02:15:00.920 --> 02:15:07.560
to ensure equity and access within our districts. Improving the template will help align the process

02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:12.840
of strategic planning and community engagement with the original intent of the LCAP.

02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:20.840

the opportunity to comment. My name is Joshua Schultz. I'm the Deputy Superintendent for the

02:15:35.720 --> 02:15:40.920
Napa County Office of Education. I've also had the privilege of serving on CDE's LCAP advisory

02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:46.520
group since its inception. Napa COE strongly supports CDE's proposed revisions to the LCAP

02:15:46.520 --> 02:15:52.120
template and instructions. Addressing the mandates of SB 114 in the LCAP instructions is the correct

02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:57.400
approach as opposed to adding more unnecessary boxes and prompts. In addition, all the changes

02:15:57.400 --> 02:16:02.200
made to streamline the template by removing redundancy are improvements. There are ways to

02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:07.240
further simplify the LCAP template without losing any information. I will suggest just one for your

02:16:07.240 --> 02:16:13.240
consideration today. Adding one column to the data entry table for the description of the action

02:16:13.240 --> 02:16:17.560
would make the action table in the gold section of the template entirely redundant and thus it

02:16:17.560 --> 02:16:22.760
could be removed. That one change would reduce the length of the typical LCAP by at least 20%.

02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:30.040

Good morning. My name is Erika Cervantes and I am the Policy and Advocacy Manager for Alliance

02:16:40.040 --> 02:16:44.760
for a Better Community. We're a Latino policy and advocacy organization located in Los Angeles.

02:16:45.320 --> 02:16:49.240
We appreciate the genuine efforts to address achievements and equity gaps for

02:16:49.240 --> 02:16:53.880
English learners, especially our long-term English learners. I'm here to call your attention to an

02:16:53.880 --> 02:17:00.360
incongruence in the language on one of the items on the draft. On page 31, bullet two refers to

02:17:00.680 --> 02:17:05.320
required metrics for LEAs to monitor the effectiveness of identified actions.

02:17:06.040 --> 02:17:11.960
But bullet one states that LEAs are only encouraged to identify metrics for specific student

02:17:11.960 --> 02:17:17.240
groups as appropriate, including expected outcomes that address and reduce disparities

02:17:17.240 --> 02:17:21.880
in outcomes between student groups. In order for the two statements to be congruent,

02:17:21.880 --> 02:17:29.560
we recommend the wording in bullet one be changed from encouraged to identify to shall identify

02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:34.440
so that it reads LEAs shall identify metrics for student groups, which then match with the

02:17:34.440 --> 02:17:40.200
second bullet point that requires metrics to be identified. These new LCAP requirements.

02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:48.840
Thank you. Thank you. Next caller ending in 1488, please state your name and affiliation

02:17:54.120 --> 02:17:58.520
Good morning, President Darlene Hammond, Vice President Gov. Lover Woods and members of the

02:17:58.520 --> 02:18:03.240
board. My name is Jennifer Hicks. I'm the Associate Superintendent of Educational Services

02:18:03.240 --> 02:18:08.120
for the Placer County Office of Education. I'm calling on behalf of Placer County Office of

02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:14.200
Education to share support of the CDE's recommendations to consolidate and amend the

02:18:14.200 --> 02:18:19.080
LCAP template and instructions. We would like to thank the CDE staff for their thoughtful

02:18:19.080 --> 02:18:24.440
considerations and revisions. As time has progressed, the original intent of the LCAP

02:18:24.440 --> 02:18:29.960
has become more buried in the complexity and format of the current LCAP. These recommended

02:18:29.960 --> 02:18:35.080
amendments help us to return to the original intent, which is to truly serve as a strategic

02:18:35.080 --> 02:18:40.280
plan that is accessible, transparent, and understandable. As a county office who

02:18:40.920 --> 02:18:45.240
provides support and assistance for 16 districts in Northern California,

02:18:45.240 --> 02:18:50.440
streamlining the LCAP further supports our efforts to work in partnership with our districts

02:18:50.520 --> 02:18:55.720
and helps them develop a comprehensive strategic plan that is responsive to student,

02:18:55.720 --> 02:19:01.880
family, and community needs. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller ending in 0625,

please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

02:19:10.520 --> 02:19:14.680
Good morning, President Darlene Hammond and members of the board. My name is Hannah Ma,

02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:19.480
Director of District and School Support from Contra Costa County Office of Education.

02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:23.880
I'm calling in to support the CDE's recommendations that streamline the LCAP.

02:19:24.440 --> 02:19:30.200
We truly appreciate the thoughtful revisions that were proposed by Joshua Strong and the CDE,

02:19:30.200 --> 02:19:35.160
which are really aimed to consolidate and reorganize the LCAP that fulfills the State

02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:42.040
Board of Education's direction to streamline the LCAP. The CDE's proposed revisions do create

02:19:42.040 --> 02:19:47.400
transparency, coherence, and readability for both the LCAP readers and the writers.

02:19:48.040 --> 02:19:53.320
The revised LCAP highlights the importance of LEA's continuous improvement and community

02:19:53.320 --> 02:19:59.000
engagement journey. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller ending in 01987,

02:20:05.240 --> 02:20:09.640
Good morning. My name is Linda Johnson. I'm a retired educator who has the privilege of

02:20:09.640 --> 02:20:16.440
working with a couple of small school districts on their LCAP. I don't recall seeing the phrase

02:20:16.440 --> 02:20:25.160
three-year LCAP cycle in statute, and yet it has become widely used. If, in fact, it's a process,

02:20:25.160 --> 02:20:32.760
a cycle, then maybe that cycle should be year one LCAP three-year plan, year two,

02:20:32.760 --> 02:20:40.040
annual update and effectiveness study, year three, annual update and summative evaluation

02:20:40.040 --> 02:20:43.960
of effectiveness that becomes part of the basis for the new three-year plan.

02:20:44.760 --> 02:20:49.960
Thank you and have a beautiful day. Thank you. This concludes public comment for item two.

02:20:52.200 --> 02:20:56.840
Thank you very much. Lots of very informative and helpful

02:20:56.840 --> 02:21:00.920
comment. And we're now open for board discussion.

02:21:03.880 --> 02:21:10.200
Yes. Vice President Glover-Woods. All right. I'll kick us off. Again, thank you so much for

02:21:10.200 --> 02:21:18.200
everyone who gave public comment. And again, kudos, Joshua and CDE team for, again, taking on

02:21:18.200 --> 02:21:27.160
quite the large endeavor, if I should say, to really work on streamlining and still adhere

02:21:27.160 --> 02:21:33.400
to everything that's caught on legislation. So just a couple of things that I wanted to

02:21:33.400 --> 02:21:39.160
bring up and bring forward as suggestions as we move forward in this feedback portion.

02:21:40.280 --> 02:21:45.320
One is, I'm going to try to go strategically through the template, but it may or may not

02:21:45.320 --> 02:21:52.600
happen that way. In the section that is addressing educational, engaging educational partners,

02:21:53.320 --> 02:21:58.600
I was looking at both of the prompts and I have to be honest, I was having a little bit of difficulty

02:21:58.600 --> 02:22:06.040
discerning the difference between how is the engagement considered compared to the second

02:22:06.040 --> 02:22:10.520
prompt, which is how engagement with the educational partners influence the development.

02:22:11.400 --> 02:22:18.840
So if there's a way to clarify that for any of the LEAs that may be completing the LCAP or,

02:22:18.840 --> 02:22:23.720
again, community members that might be reading, I think that can be helpful. And I'm sure there

02:22:23.720 --> 02:22:29.080
is a differentiation because there are two different prompts. But again, it seemed the

02:22:29.080 --> 02:22:33.640
language seemed to be very similar. And I realized that we were collapsing one of the prompts

02:22:33.640 --> 02:22:40.680
to try to put two prompts in and address the prompt that was collapsed. The other is just

02:22:40.680 --> 02:22:45.560
to lift up, and we've heard this in public comment, the area, and I believe it's in the

02:22:45.560 --> 02:22:54.440
directions on page 21, where it says it's clear to say that LEAs need to identify various student

02:22:54.440 --> 02:23:00.280
groups. It's page 21, I believe, in the directions. And then the closing statement says that they are

02:23:00.280 --> 02:23:09.240
encouraged to identify highlights or how they're addressing. And I just want to share that I'd like

02:23:09.240 --> 02:23:16.040
to see that change to a shall as well. It does require them to identify. It doesn't necessarily

02:23:16.040 --> 02:23:20.680
encourage them to be specific on how they're addressing the needs with that language. And

02:23:21.400 --> 02:23:26.520
while I know the large majority of our LEAs would put that in there, but I think we should be very

02:23:26.520 --> 02:23:34.360
clear in the language that it's not a may do, it is a must do to do that. The last little piece

02:23:34.360 --> 02:23:43.240
I'll say and then stop for other member comments is in relation to, again, recognizing the size

02:23:43.240 --> 02:23:48.760
of the LCAP most definitely. It's exciting that the template itself is seven pages, but we know

02:23:48.760 --> 02:23:53.560
the LCAP itself really turns into hundreds of pages by the time everything is in there. And I

02:23:53.560 --> 02:23:59.160
know all efforts to streamline are taking place and we'll continue to tool that down so it is a

02:23:59.160 --> 02:24:06.840
useful document for everyone as is desired. Thinking about the LCFF equity multiplier

02:24:07.640 --> 02:24:13.880
goal that is listed, it kind of went back and forth over this, but I'll tell you kind of where

02:24:13.880 --> 02:24:21.000
I'm landing right now is that if it is not required in statute, that there has to be an

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:29.960
individual goal for every school. It may be helpful to give LEAs the flexibility to combine

02:24:30.760 --> 02:24:39.320
schools under a particular goal or goals with this particular caveat, which is in the directions,

02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:46.280
it should first of all require that the goal be preceded with a statement saying that it is an

02:24:46.280 --> 02:24:53.080
equity multiplier goal so that that's very, very clear to anyone reading the plan and that they

02:24:53.080 --> 02:24:59.320
should also identify the school or schools that are targeted by that particular goal.

02:24:59.880 --> 02:25:06.040
But being able to combine goals I think can encourage communities of practices across sites

02:25:07.080 --> 02:25:13.320
within an LEA as well as provide opportunities for collaboration related to those specific

02:25:13.320 --> 02:25:17.960
student groups and may also help with the size of the actual document itself.

02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:24.920
I'm going to piggyback on those comments myself and then recognize others who want to add on

02:25:24.920 --> 02:25:30.840
and by the way this is not an action item, this is a feedback item and we are in the process of

02:25:30.840 --> 02:25:34.920
doing that and at the right time we'll get the recommendation slide back up

02:25:36.120 --> 02:25:41.880
with respect to that. I also think that to the extent that it's possible to cluster schools

02:25:42.520 --> 02:25:50.600
for the equity multiplier goals that would make a lot of sense if we can find out how to make that

02:25:52.280 --> 02:25:59.960
comport with the expectation of the statute and to justify why they would be similar.

02:25:59.960 --> 02:26:04.200
You might have a lot of schools that are not all similar and then there might need to be different

02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:10.840
groupings where you say this is the literacy approach that we're using here or this is the

02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:18.200
challenge that we're going to address there etc. But I agree with the intention to create both

02:26:18.200 --> 02:26:26.040
communities of practice and to make it clear and simpler. There was another suggestion among the

02:26:26.040 --> 02:26:30.680
commenters that there are some places where tables rather than narrative boxes might allow for the

02:26:30.680 --> 02:26:36.040
communication of information more efficiently and I can see a couple of places where that would be

02:26:36.040 --> 02:26:42.360
the case or could be the case so just want to lift that up for consideration as you continue the

02:26:43.480 --> 02:26:52.520
very important work you're doing to make this doable. We also heard about the inclusion of

02:26:52.520 --> 02:27:00.360
proven carryover which I think is an important thing to allow for. There was a question about

02:27:00.360 --> 02:27:05.560
whether there could be an alternative for county offices and I could imagine why that might be

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:13.960
desirable but I wanted to get your feedback on that Josh whether the way in which they're

02:27:13.960 --> 02:27:18.440
presenting their work is sufficiently different or the work is sufficiently different that

02:27:19.160 --> 02:27:24.360
there would be any justification for an alternative form.

02:27:25.160 --> 02:27:29.320
Well

02:27:31.880 --> 02:27:42.440
originally if we go back into the depths of time back to 2013 when the LCFF was put into place

02:27:42.440 --> 02:27:53.000
the original education code section 52064 directed the state board to develop templates

02:27:54.520 --> 02:28:03.480
for the LCAP. In the intervening years the plurality of that has been taken away

02:28:03.480 --> 02:28:11.160
and it is now template so 52064 currently requires the adoption of a single template

02:28:12.440 --> 02:28:18.760
not multiple templates but that doesn't necessarily you know preclude that from changing.

02:28:19.560 --> 02:28:27.000
I it you know I mean we we've learned a lot over the years in in terms of the LCAP.

02:28:28.120 --> 02:28:37.880
I think that that to a certain extent it depends on the state's desire to have a consistent template

02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:44.120
that could be that that folks throughout the state can interact with on a consistent level

02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:51.960
versus the need the desire to tailor the template to the needs of of individual districts based on

02:28:51.960 --> 02:28:58.600
their their size or scope. I just understand that the responsibilities of counties to be

02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:03.800
different in some ways than than the responsibilities of the LEAs but I think your point is

02:29:04.440 --> 02:29:09.720
well taken it's more food for thought and I love the fact that you're sort of representing a

02:29:09.720 --> 02:29:17.240
learning organization here in a learning state. Are there other comments? Member Olken and then

02:29:17.240 --> 02:29:23.400
member Lewis and then member Yoshimoto-Towery and then member Escobedo. What about this side

02:29:23.400 --> 02:29:31.320
of the room? Okay member Petillo-Browns. Thank you. Thanks first of all for all the great and

02:29:32.200 --> 02:29:37.000
inclusive work to get us to this stage. I really appreciate it in the public comment.

02:29:37.960 --> 02:29:45.000
How much feedback there was about this proposed template streamlining

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:51.400
and becoming clearer because as somebody who's written quite a few LCAPs

02:29:53.320 --> 02:29:59.320
I know how hard that is to do to try and fulfill all the requirements and also create something

02:29:59.320 --> 02:30:04.280
that makes any sense and so I just really was pleased with all all the public comment that

02:30:04.280 --> 02:30:11.480
we heard to that effect and so my my comments are sort of are related to that as a writer.

02:30:13.400 --> 02:30:21.800
So sort of the way I think I would think about it is you have you know many audiences but if you

02:30:21.800 --> 02:30:26.360
want if you want to simplify you have those who are writing and those who are reading

02:30:27.320 --> 02:30:33.240
and they have different needs and so I sort of thought about it like

02:30:34.280 --> 02:30:40.600
the instructions are really for the writers and the template is really for the readers

02:30:41.640 --> 02:30:49.960
and so I think one of the things you commented on was that there was an intent

02:30:50.360 --> 02:30:56.920
to put the types of things that may not apply to everybody in the instructions

02:30:57.480 --> 02:31:03.960
to keep the template clear right and I appreciate that and so it makes me wonder

02:31:03.960 --> 02:31:12.200
if there are ways in the instructions to call out the places where even more clearly

02:31:12.200 --> 02:31:19.080
where things are different for different LEAs so like for example for those of you receiving

02:31:20.840 --> 02:31:26.280
LCFF equity multiplier funds here's what you might want to consider or

02:31:28.920 --> 02:31:36.360
we've allowed for flexibility for where you show where you show your metrics and these are the

02:31:36.360 --> 02:31:41.800
three different places like rather than it so it's like you have it embedded in the instructions

02:31:41.800 --> 02:31:47.640
but I wonder if they could also be called out a specific like here's some common things you

02:31:47.640 --> 02:31:52.200
writers might be trying to go back because what I would do is I would go back and forth between

02:31:53.400 --> 02:31:57.240
the template and the instructions and try you know and so so anyway I just I think

02:31:58.040 --> 02:32:04.920
in the effort to keep it as clear and streamlined as possible there might be a way to really think

02:32:04.920 --> 02:32:11.480
about the instructions a little bit more especially where things are different or there's opportunity

02:32:11.480 --> 02:32:22.120
for LEAs to to make choices about how they want to present things. Does that make sense? Yeah. Thank you.

02:32:24.360 --> 02:32:31.880
Linda Lewis. Thank you and I want to also echo the sentiments of my fellow board members on

02:32:31.880 --> 02:32:38.200
your presentation and all the work that went behind trying to make the LCAP document more

02:32:38.760 --> 02:32:44.760
transparent easier to read and easy to put together and I like member oak and this was

02:32:44.760 --> 02:32:50.760
part of my life for seven years I love the LCAP because I the potential for the good that can come

02:32:50.760 --> 02:32:56.120
out of it when it's put together well and has the input of all stakeholders to make outcomes

02:32:56.680 --> 02:33:03.080
better for kids I just think it has all tremendous possibilities so I appreciate that maybe I

02:33:03.080 --> 02:33:11.640
shouldn't say I love the LCAP but just a few comments based on what some of the callers said

02:33:11.640 --> 02:33:16.520
and just some thoughts I have and I won't repeat try to go into depth and repeat anything that I've

02:33:16.520 --> 02:33:23.720
agreed with my colleagues have said but again in line with member Olkins comments about continuing

02:33:23.720 --> 02:33:28.680
to make the instructions and things and and differentiating between this is good for the

02:33:28.680 --> 02:33:33.640
writer this is good for the reader there was a comment about from a county office of ed about

02:33:34.280 --> 02:33:40.280
places maybe where you can replace the narrative responses more with tables and give more more

02:33:40.280 --> 02:33:45.800
flexibility to the to the to the districts and doing that and I know you've done a great job

02:33:45.800 --> 02:33:51.400
of that now kind of making the narrative more concise but if there's possibility where they

02:33:51.400 --> 02:33:56.680
could have flexibility in using tables as opposed to the narrative that would be great also there

02:33:56.680 --> 02:34:03.320
was comments about and I believe I read it in the agenda item about the equity multiplier

02:34:03.320 --> 02:34:10.040
the funds not being supplantive okay but more supportive but if there's a way that you can

02:34:10.040 --> 02:34:14.600
continue to emphasize that throughout the document seems like that would be helpful for districts

02:34:15.240 --> 02:34:22.120
and also going back to the equity multiplier and the large districts and those that might be

02:34:22.120 --> 02:34:27.240
has you know 15 or more schools that have to come up with goals there was something mentioned

02:34:27.240 --> 02:34:32.440
about the single school plan for student achievement and I think you know there's

02:34:33.080 --> 02:34:37.320
the work that goes on at the district level and the support that they provide to schools

02:34:38.280 --> 02:34:44.600
within the district and then the work actually happens on the ground floor right so I don't know

02:34:44.600 --> 02:34:51.400
if there's a way that without listing all those goals but maybe general support that the district

02:34:51.400 --> 02:34:58.440
supplies to the district to the schools in terms of funding for literacy support or whatever they're

02:34:58.440 --> 02:35:04.200
going to do in general but maybe the the actual goals could be listed somehow with the single

02:35:04.200 --> 02:35:08.920
school plan for student achievement I don't know if there's if that goes against statute to even

02:35:08.920 --> 02:35:15.160
allow that to happen with regards to the development but there was a comment about how long that section

02:35:15.160 --> 02:35:20.680
and how intense it could be and you know every reader is not reading for every school they're

02:35:20.680 --> 02:35:25.880
reading for their specific school and when they're involved in this single school plan

02:35:25.880 --> 02:35:29.960
for student achievement at the at the local level at the school level then that could be more

02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:35.880
fleshed out I don't know if that's possible but maybe something to to look into thank you

02:35:39.880 --> 02:35:48.040
member Yoshimoto Tari thank you for stating that so eloquently uh board member lewis uh thank you

02:35:48.040 --> 02:35:51.960
and again just want to reiterate the responsiveness and all the public comment

02:35:51.960 --> 02:35:56.280
that came in thank you for that I think we're we're modeling at the state level what the

02:35:56.280 --> 02:36:03.880
engagement process uh ought to be at at a local level um you said it very nicely board member

02:36:03.880 --> 02:36:08.360
lewis I'm not going to repeat that I think I'd be interested in the alignment between the single

02:36:09.240 --> 02:36:14.360
plans for student achievement at the school level and ultimately schools that would be listed

02:36:15.320 --> 02:36:23.640
under the multiplier section to really possibly in the training aspect of the template to address

02:36:23.640 --> 02:36:30.600
that fully so that there's that uh cohesiveness from the local schools to the local to the lea

02:36:31.960 --> 02:36:38.600
and then also uh I do I want to take some moment and step back and

02:36:38.600 --> 02:36:44.280
write what broaden the aperture a tiny bit because in this process of reviewing the template

02:36:44.280 --> 02:36:48.440
it really became apparent to me why we have to have such an accessible I thought I didn't know

02:36:48.440 --> 02:36:55.400
this before but an accessible dashboard with the disaggregated data uh for all students and and

02:36:55.400 --> 02:37:01.240
student groups the status and the growth uh the training and professional development as well as

02:37:03.240 --> 02:37:08.920
within a local control setting how we need to highlight processes and practices that are

02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:15.000
exemplary across the state so that lea's have opportunities to learn from each other and also

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:20.680
simultaneously personalize for their own action plans so it's just needed to take a moment to

02:37:20.680 --> 02:37:26.040
share that sort of reflection about how it how really beautifully it all fits together

02:37:26.040 --> 02:37:30.760
is they come to board and individual action items so we don't often get to see talk about them like

02:37:31.320 --> 02:37:36.280
holistically so I wanted to mention that and then lastly I did have a question I know we're

02:37:36.840 --> 02:37:41.720
we're recommending consolidating the sections in the educational partner engagement

02:37:42.600 --> 02:37:48.280
piece but there is some concern about removing the second prompt so how can you reiterate

02:37:49.720 --> 02:37:53.480
because the robust educational partnership engagement so essential to the LCAP process

02:37:54.680 --> 02:37:58.280
how the remaining prompts that we have in the current template proposed template

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:05.480
ensure that we retain that focus on partner engagement josh please so so within

02:38:06.920 --> 02:38:15.640
the engaging educational partners section um and again you know taking into into account

02:38:16.680 --> 02:38:23.000
um the the previous request to to provide better clarity between the instructions for prompt one

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:30.200
and prompt two um the the first prompt really relates to the process how the how the what

02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:34.440
process is being used to ensure that the educational partners are being engaged

02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:41.240
the the second prompt would be the description of how that engagement then influenced the

02:38:41.240 --> 02:38:48.280
development of the plan and so there when when LEAs are responding to that it's not simply saying

02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:58.200
the um the the feedback provided by the educational partners led to the development of this goal or

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:06.120
the inclusion of this action or the inclusion of these funds it's it's more based on

02:39:07.080 --> 02:39:14.680
the following feedback provided by the educational partners by by our our teachers and support staff

02:39:16.200 --> 02:39:24.840
who stated that that um we need to have more of something I don't know um take your pick

02:39:24.840 --> 02:39:31.240
um we've included this particular action um and and so and so there's there's more

02:39:32.200 --> 02:39:39.320
in when when we're going through our our LCAP development trainings and and um one of the things

02:39:39.320 --> 02:39:44.680
that that's consistent we consistently refer to is what we what we call the through line

02:39:45.400 --> 02:39:55.080
um and how there needs to be a a through line through the data through the identified needs

02:39:55.080 --> 02:40:00.600
through the feedback that's that's showing up in the engaging educational partners section

02:40:01.720 --> 02:40:07.720
through the rationale for why we develop the goals into the actions and and there should be

02:40:07.800 --> 02:40:17.320
you know a consistent focus there on on providing this this line so that folks can see that the

02:40:17.320 --> 02:40:22.760
direct causal nature of here's how we arrived at these particular actions

02:40:23.960 --> 02:40:28.280
that would be described in the second prompt when it comes to the educational partner feedback

02:40:30.280 --> 02:40:34.360
thank you I just think it's important to hear that reassurance as we streamline the tool

02:40:35.240 --> 02:40:39.960
for use usability and also for that focus on continuous improvement I really like that

02:40:39.960 --> 02:40:47.320
that added focus there thank you member Escobedo and then we have member Patil Bronson anyone else

02:40:47.320 --> 02:40:54.680
want to be in the queue thank you once again I really appreciate all all this work is herculean

02:40:54.680 --> 02:41:01.080
to say the least and and being able to balance all these new requirements also and and make it

02:41:01.080 --> 02:41:08.120
specific and tangible so appreciate all that and you know one thing that I worry about this

02:41:08.120 --> 02:41:13.720
document that was a real learning documents becoming more and more focused on compliance and

02:41:13.720 --> 02:41:20.040
so I really appreciate though how you're trying to create more of a learning document and I was

02:41:20.040 --> 02:41:29.480
just wondering in in the your goal analysis two of three were LEAs who have not shown improvement

02:41:29.480 --> 02:41:37.720
after three years will have to kind of change their plans I know if there's a possibility of

02:41:37.720 --> 02:41:46.280
having someone kind of do an analysis of all these LCAPs and finding out what have been the best

02:41:46.280 --> 02:41:53.720
practices after all these years for these for specific groups you know if there's any way that

02:41:54.680 --> 02:42:02.440
this can be distilled that you know the you know this this has worked in this specific

02:42:02.440 --> 02:42:07.480
you know area in California with this specific group something you may want to look at and

02:42:07.480 --> 02:42:13.960
compare to your actions right just just trying to figure out if there's any type of research

02:42:13.960 --> 02:42:22.520
opportunity to look at best practices because we have had districts who've used the LCAP

02:42:22.520 --> 02:42:31.320
and shown significant gains what we haven't had though is the ability to share these best practices

02:42:31.320 --> 02:42:39.240
to other districts and as a result of that we've had more legislation coming down the

02:42:39.240 --> 02:42:44.680
pike because there's certain groups that are not improving even though they've been doing

02:42:44.680 --> 02:42:50.760
these actions over and over and over again so just just something to to to think about

02:42:51.080 --> 02:43:00.680
is how do we create this learning document that it it that allows districts to continue to improve

02:43:01.960 --> 02:43:08.120
and just wondered about the tables are they self-populated or can they be self-populated

02:43:09.080 --> 02:43:16.440
now that we're looking at common forms of data which tables you're referring to the the the tables

02:43:16.440 --> 02:43:24.040
within this this part of the template here the the word document portion of the template

02:43:24.040 --> 02:43:34.600
or the tables here in the for the actions well I would say the the table that asks for

02:43:35.560 --> 02:43:39.880
my understanding metric data okay

02:43:42.840 --> 02:43:44.280
metrics that we already

02:43:46.840 --> 02:43:53.080
you know through our dashboard through casp and so forth is there any way that some of this

02:43:53.080 --> 02:43:58.520
information can be downloaded automatically or is this something that the district will

02:43:58.520 --> 02:44:04.920
pretty much has to populate by there and I don't know I I mean just just

02:44:06.840 --> 02:44:17.400
the I think the answer is it depends there there are certain so so within within the

02:44:17.400 --> 02:44:23.560
state priorities there are four priorities number four four five and six within education code

02:44:23.560 --> 02:44:30.680
section five two zero six zero d four five and six that that specify a number of of what we

02:44:30.680 --> 02:44:39.720
refer to as state required metrics they include things like the the student progress on state

02:44:39.720 --> 02:44:47.240
standardized test scores or the percentage of students that have completed a through g courses

02:44:47.240 --> 02:44:59.240
or things of that nature with the exception of of certain indicators such as expulsion rate

02:44:59.240 --> 02:45:08.840
or suspension rate or chronic absenteeism rate there's there's a wide variety of ways in which

02:45:08.840 --> 02:45:15.800
LEAs actually report on those pieces of data some LEAs have chosen to meet that requirement by

02:45:15.800 --> 02:45:23.160
tying it directly to dashboard indicators some have chosen to tie it directly to student progress

02:45:23.160 --> 02:45:32.040
within related to standardized test scores some have chosen to so because because of the

02:45:32.040 --> 02:45:38.200
differences that exist there in the way that LEAs just in the nature of providing a flexible document

02:45:38.840 --> 02:45:46.840
um there's there's relatively few of these you know things like these metrics that could be

02:45:46.840 --> 02:45:54.120
pre-populated um in in a meaningful way that would relate to all LEAs throughout the state

02:45:54.840 --> 02:45:59.480
in order to have something like that in place there would have to be a much more prescriptive

02:45:59.880 --> 02:46:10.520
um implementation of how each of those state required metrics was was described within the

02:46:10.520 --> 02:46:18.520
plan and then that also doesn't include any local metrics that they're also including

02:46:18.520 --> 02:46:23.960
such as informative assessments or things like that thank you

02:46:23.960 --> 02:46:32.840
all right um member patilla bronson and member roscoe gonzalez and i should let you know that we

02:46:32.840 --> 02:46:38.200
have planned for one more item before lunch um so i know this is fascinating

02:46:41.480 --> 02:46:48.760
but maybe we can get quickly to the point um okay so i will do this rapid fire i'll

02:46:48.760 --> 02:46:53.400
reiterate thanks um for the the balancing act that you are undertaking

02:46:53.960 --> 02:46:58.600
and just want to underscore three points that some of our colleagues have already made

02:46:58.600 --> 02:47:05.640
page 27 movement from encourage to shall the request for language reiterating supplement

02:47:05.640 --> 02:47:12.440
rather than supplant and the possibility of using tables instead of narrative requirements

02:47:12.440 --> 02:47:17.080
wherever possible what a great role model

02:47:19.400 --> 02:47:26.200
member roscoe gonzalez and then member rodriguez thanks kim actually you just mentioned about the

02:47:26.200 --> 02:47:32.120
shell comment so that um i just want to reinforce your comments i think i believe exactly that so

02:47:32.120 --> 02:47:37.000
thank you josh also to your team for the revisions that improve the comprehensiveness of the plan and

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:41.880
address disparities and opportunities and outcomes among student groups and ensure technical

02:47:41.880 --> 02:47:46.280
assistance eligibility with all these revisions how will the cd ensure that the lea's have

02:47:46.280 --> 02:47:51.800
sufficient guidance and support to implement the revised out kept requirements effectively

02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:59.960
i just want to kind of remind our lea's that the cd has a plan for that yeah um so for

02:48:02.520 --> 02:48:10.040
i forget how many years um we've we've been doing a series of webinars um we refer to them as

02:48:10.600 --> 02:48:16.600
tuesdays at two um but they actually occur on tuesdays at two and thursdays at three

02:48:18.120 --> 02:48:25.000
because people remember that kind of thing and um but but for for this particular rollout

02:48:25.640 --> 02:48:35.320
assuming that the um that the board adopts the revised template in november based on the timeline

02:48:35.320 --> 02:48:42.840
that was already provided our plan is to provide webinars on on tuesday and thursday

02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:49.160
with with a couple of breaks off for thanksgiving and and good behavior

02:48:51.800 --> 02:49:00.120
for well a series of eight total webinars that start off with an introduction to lcff for anybody

02:49:00.120 --> 02:49:05.720
that's new out there in the field then go into the template and the instructions then we spend

02:49:06.520 --> 02:49:11.160
we'll we'll spend an entire webinar talking about the engaging educational partners

02:49:11.160 --> 02:49:17.880
requirements and and that piece of the plan we have another one related to goals and actions

02:49:17.880 --> 02:49:26.600
in general we'll have one specifically for the lcff equity multiplier goals and then two webinars

02:49:27.480 --> 02:49:32.440
that are that specifically go into the requirements to increase or improve services

02:49:32.440 --> 02:49:38.040
for low-income english learner and foster youth students and then in addition to that one we also

02:49:38.040 --> 02:49:43.640
do one on the local indicator process as part of the dashboard since my office supports that as

02:49:43.640 --> 02:49:51.960
well so so those will span november to december of of this coming year in addition to that

02:49:52.120 --> 02:49:58.280
um lea's will also continue to to receive support from their county offices of education as as they

02:49:58.280 --> 02:50:04.120
um have and the county offices will will also work would be working with them to ensure that

02:50:04.120 --> 02:50:09.720
they have access to all of the new information and and that that's being implemented

02:50:09.720 --> 02:50:11.480
implemented

02:50:16.520 --> 02:50:23.320
so i also want to thank you and i want to thank our community partners who have engaged so much

02:50:23.320 --> 02:50:31.000
in this process and i will um just echo um my support for what's already been said

02:50:31.720 --> 02:50:37.240
but i also want to make an observation as you were going through the reflective process and

02:50:37.240 --> 02:50:42.200
then the adding what are we going to do about it right you know like so these are the students

02:50:42.200 --> 02:50:46.840
especially the long-term english learners which i i'm so glad to see highlighted and

02:50:47.880 --> 02:50:53.400
get the attention that um they deserve because that's been an enigma for a lot of us how are

02:50:53.400 --> 02:50:59.640
we going to support our long-term english learners but i was reminded of um as a national board

02:50:59.640 --> 02:51:05.800
teacher the architecture of accomplished teaching which is a reflective process of setting goals

02:51:06.360 --> 02:51:13.560
revisiting them this isn't working what am i going to do and coming back and back to this and so

02:51:13.560 --> 02:51:22.360
i love the mindset of um this process of inviting our district into our classrooms

02:51:22.360 --> 02:51:25.800
so that we can see how we can support all of our students together thank you

02:51:25.800 --> 02:51:37.640
so in regards to the engaging educational partner section um within the instructions

02:51:38.280 --> 02:51:43.160
i was wondering if it was possible if lea's serving secondary sites specifically

02:51:43.160 --> 02:51:48.120
could be required to discuss how student input was incorporated within those two prompts

02:51:48.680 --> 02:51:53.800
um and i say this because i'm in contact with many of the student board members across districts in

02:51:53.800 --> 02:51:58.680
the state and what i hear is that a lot of students aren't aware of the l cap or that they

02:51:58.680 --> 02:52:04.760
don't know that they have a say and oftentimes during this process students are asked for input

02:52:04.760 --> 02:52:09.880
at the very end when decisions are close to being finalized instead of being a part of the process

02:52:09.880 --> 02:52:15.720
and that decision making all the way through um and i i just i don't know if any students know

02:52:15.720 --> 02:52:22.200
that they're even considered educational partners so if there could be that requirement that lea

02:52:22.200 --> 02:52:29.080
specifically focus on student input within the educational engagement prompts um and not just

02:52:29.080 --> 02:52:33.400
have it be generalized i think that could really help students know that they are supposed to be a

02:52:33.400 --> 02:52:38.440
part of that process but i just wanted to bring that up just so that can be considered but i

02:52:38.440 --> 02:52:43.240
really do appreciate all of the work that you've done and you created a very comprehensive presentation

02:53:00.600 --> 02:53:09.000
so happy we've moved away from uh the less acceptable uh phrases of moving towards educational partners

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:14.600
and letting go of the old terminology of i don't even know what it is but we moved away from that

02:53:14.600 --> 02:53:23.080
so thank you for for for doing that all right great and on that note uh we thank you very much

02:53:23.080 --> 02:53:29.400
for all of this work uh this is a information item and an input item and so we have given you

02:53:29.400 --> 02:53:35.720
plenty to chew on uh beyond the very important work that's already been done thank you

02:53:35.720 --> 02:53:46.360
uh and we will uh go ahead and continue on with um our next item uh which is uh the um item on casp

02:53:47.320 --> 02:53:53.480
uh and lpac and i've got to find my uh the california assessment of student performance

02:53:53.480 --> 02:53:59.080
and progress and english language proficiency assessments item three uh request for approval

02:53:59.080 --> 02:54:04.760
of the proposed 2023 california assessment of uh student performance and progress

02:54:05.560 --> 02:54:11.480
and lpac score reports and an update on assessment program activities

02:54:12.920 --> 02:54:16.680
this is something we have been talking about before so we hope it will be

02:54:17.320 --> 02:54:24.440
pretty expeditious uh process of decision making and mal vang will be presenting the item

02:54:24.440 --> 02:54:29.000
wow it's nice to see you please begin thank you

02:54:32.280 --> 02:54:41.160
oh good afternoon uh chief deputy nicely president arlen hammon vice president glover woods

02:54:41.160 --> 02:54:46.840
and our esteemed board members uh i'm mal vang director of the assessment development and

02:54:46.840 --> 02:54:52.520
administration division at the california department of education under the instruction

02:54:52.520 --> 02:54:54.600
measurement and administration branch branch

02:55:00.120 --> 02:55:07.640
so the item before you today is an action and an information item however before i go

02:55:08.920 --> 02:55:14.600
onto the specifics of the item i would like to just share with you an important transition

02:55:14.600 --> 02:55:22.360
in the assessment development and administration division um here it is uh linda hooper dr linda

02:55:22.440 --> 02:55:33.960
hooper she's our associate director uh she retired on august 31st um 2023 and she has spent uh 33

02:55:33.960 --> 02:55:42.040
years with the state and 17 of those years were at the department of education and um she has

02:55:42.040 --> 02:55:48.920
led the implementation of the statewide assessments um through such trying times and changes such as

02:55:48.920 --> 02:55:55.320
when we did the transition from the paper test to the computer-based assessments uh she was

02:55:55.320 --> 02:56:02.040
instrumental in bringing the science assessments from the conceptual stage to our operational stage

02:56:02.680 --> 02:56:08.520
and she was always um ensuring trying to ensure and work with the contractors to make sure that

02:56:08.520 --> 02:56:15.800
we develop assessments that are of the highest quality possible and accessible to all students

02:56:15.800 --> 02:56:21.160
i just want to let you all know that she has made such lasting contributions to our

02:56:21.160 --> 02:56:26.120
statewide assessments in california i would just want to give her a few words of congratulations

02:56:26.920 --> 02:56:34.680
she couldn't be here today but you know we just want to honor her thank you and then on to my

02:56:36.200 --> 02:56:42.360
presentation in this presentation i will cover the following um we will provide an overview

02:56:42.360 --> 02:56:48.920
of the california department of education's recommendation for approval and then i'll go over

02:56:49.480 --> 02:56:54.040
briefly the assessment updates for the interim assessments as well as the national international

02:56:54.040 --> 02:56:59.480
assessments and finally we'll return back to the recommendation for the state board of education

02:56:59.480 --> 02:57:09.800
action so there has been uh an update to the recommendation um that was provided in the item

02:57:09.800 --> 02:57:17.320
and item three as written due to feedback from the education coalition we were able to add

02:57:17.320 --> 02:57:23.240
some language to the recommendation to allow for the edits to be made and i will share that

02:57:24.120 --> 02:57:31.320
next i believe that brooks may be um bringing you a paper copy because it's kind of hard to see

02:57:32.280 --> 02:57:40.200
and to fit all on a page so the recommendation reads the california department of education

02:57:40.200 --> 02:57:46.520
recommends that the california state board of education approve the proposed revisions

02:57:46.520 --> 02:57:52.120
to the california assessment of student performance and progress and the english

02:57:52.120 --> 02:57:59.800
language proficiency assessments for california or alpac student score reports or ssrs as provided

02:57:59.880 --> 02:58:06.760
in attachment to to be implemented starting with the 2023-24 administration

02:58:07.560 --> 02:58:14.520
that portion was what was written in the item the addition in addition the cde recommends that the

02:58:14.520 --> 02:58:22.520
sbe delegate authority to cde staff subject to approval of the sbe executive director

02:58:22.520 --> 02:58:27.640
to make the following types of necessary clarifying technical edits to the ssrs

02:58:28.280 --> 02:58:36.120
such as including examples of communication modes in the alternate alpac ssrs and inserting

02:58:36.120 --> 02:58:43.240
language in the summative alpac ssr to make the connection between the overall score combination

02:58:43.240 --> 02:58:51.240
of two performance areas to the performance areas on the following page if feasible in multiple

02:58:51.240 --> 02:58:51.880
languages

02:58:55.640 --> 02:59:01.160
okay and we'll come back to that later so in this portion

02:59:04.760 --> 02:59:11.240
i'll go over the recommended ssrs for the the casp or the california assessment of student

02:59:11.240 --> 02:59:17.480
performance and progress and the english language proficiency assessments for california or alpac

02:59:18.040 --> 02:59:21.160
i'm just going to highlight some of the goals of the

02:59:22.120 --> 02:59:28.360
student score report redesign the changes and the enhancements to the student score reports

02:59:30.120 --> 02:59:37.720
so a quick timeline overview during the july sbe meeting we shared the timeline of the redesign

02:59:37.720 --> 02:59:43.720
effort that included a thoughtful iterative process through which the cde and our testing

02:59:43.720 --> 02:59:51.400
contractor ets sought feedback and since the july meeting ets and cde have explored and

02:59:51.400 --> 02:59:59.480
responded to the feedback received today i'm presenting the proposed redesign ssrs for approval

03:00:00.200 --> 03:00:06.600
so if the board approves the proposed revisions today the cde will work with ets to implement

03:00:06.680 --> 03:00:14.200
the redesign student score reports beginning with this year's administration the 2023-24

03:00:19.240 --> 03:00:25.320
one of the main goals of the redesign is to improve the reporting of test results provided

03:00:25.320 --> 03:00:32.840
to students parents and guardians and include actionable information so the redesign score

03:00:32.840 --> 03:00:37.720
reports provide an appropriate level of information for the summative assessments

03:00:38.600 --> 03:00:45.640
and they do not provide the granular information that perhaps uh interims or other assessments

03:00:45.640 --> 03:00:53.960
may provide so to summarize the changes the revised student score reports include score

03:00:53.960 --> 03:01:01.080
history section changes performance areas include that include the composite claim reporting

03:01:01.720 --> 03:01:10.360
for the english language arts or and literacy or ela and mathematics assessments the essay

03:01:10.360 --> 03:01:18.920
performance scores for the smarter balance ela writing or written extended response the lexile

03:01:18.920 --> 03:01:25.640
and quantile measures are integrated into the report and the score comparisons or we'll have

03:01:25.640 --> 03:01:29.240
the student score compared to the school average and the state average

03:01:32.280 --> 03:01:37.720
i will show each of those revisions in the following in the formats in the next slides

03:01:40.600 --> 03:01:46.280
so the student score history section will be available for grades four through eight for

03:01:46.280 --> 03:01:52.920
the smarter balance ela and mathematics the california alternate assessments or caas for

03:01:52.920 --> 03:01:59.880
the ela and mathematics and the california spanish assessment score history will be

03:01:59.880 --> 03:02:06.440
available for kindergarten through grade 12 for summative alpac and summative alternate alpac

03:02:07.560 --> 03:02:15.000
since um science is administered in grades five eight and once in high school the cde and ets

03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:21.480
is looking into uh the different options to include the score history in the near future

03:02:23.480 --> 03:02:29.320
when california began um using the adjusted test blueprint in the 2020-21

03:02:31.080 --> 03:02:36.280
year the ela and mathematics claim scores were removed from the ssrs

03:02:36.280 --> 03:02:41.560
smarter balance has provided the new composite claims for use with the adjusted test blueprint

03:02:41.560 --> 03:02:48.360
for the ela and math assessments and these composite claims will be provided as the performance

03:02:48.600 --> 03:02:49.160
areas

03:02:52.200 --> 03:02:58.040
for the smarter balance ela and math assessments beginning with again the school year of the

03:02:58.040 --> 03:03:07.720
2023-24 the performance areas results are reported as um above standard near standard or below

03:03:07.880 --> 03:03:12.040
um above standard near standard or below standard

03:03:16.840 --> 03:03:24.200
the essay performance scores for the first time in our casp program parents and students and

03:03:24.200 --> 03:03:30.520
guardians will have additional um information such as the this one the essay performance scores

03:03:31.240 --> 03:03:36.760
these essay um scores indicate how well students perform in the smarter balance

03:03:36.760 --> 03:03:44.280
um ela writing response extended response so in this example the student responded to a

03:03:44.280 --> 03:03:49.480
narrative i know it's kind of small but they responded to a narrative essay and the scores

03:03:49.480 --> 03:03:57.960
are provided in the categories for a narrative of the genre of narrative um in the categories of

03:03:57.960 --> 03:04:05.240
organization or purpose evidence or elaboration and conventions

03:04:11.880 --> 03:04:17.400
lexiles and quantiles in the previous administrations a student's lexile and

03:04:17.400 --> 03:04:21.720
quantile measures were provided in a separate report from the smarter balanced

03:04:22.360 --> 03:04:29.720
ela and mathematics assessments with the if if the board approves these revisions the students

03:04:29.720 --> 03:04:34.920
lexile and quantile measures will be provided within the same student score report as the

03:04:34.920 --> 03:04:42.840
smarter balanced summative ela and mathematics test results this section will also include a

03:04:42.840 --> 03:04:49.720
link to the lexile and quantile hub which is a resource provided specifically for families

03:04:52.520 --> 03:05:00.120
the revised student score report format includes the state or the school and state comparisons for

03:05:00.120 --> 03:05:06.920
the smarter balanced ela and mathematics the california science test or cast and the california

03:05:06.920 --> 03:05:15.160
alternate assessments for ela mathematics and science so the column um your child's score shows

03:05:15.400 --> 03:05:22.360
your child's score shows the student's score for the current administration and then in this example

03:05:22.360 --> 03:05:31.560
it would be the 23 24 administration for the for those particular assessments the school average

03:05:31.560 --> 03:05:41.240
column and the state average will be calculated using the average of the 20 21 22 and the 20 22

03:05:41.240 --> 03:05:43.320
23 administrations

03:05:50.440 --> 03:05:57.000
next i'll present the student score reports in their entirety starting with the casp ssrs then

03:05:57.000 --> 03:06:07.400
followed by the lpac these are rather small but you'll be able to zoom out they were also

03:06:07.400 --> 03:06:13.560
attached in the item as i mentioned earlier the ela mathematics and science results will be

03:06:13.560 --> 03:06:19.880
consolidated into one student score report while this extends the length of the student score

03:06:19.880 --> 03:06:27.320
report the improvements to the electronic delivery for example directly to the parent portal if an lea

03:06:27.320 --> 03:06:36.200
chooses will accommodate this consolidation this slide includes the first four pages of the ela

03:06:36.200 --> 03:06:42.200
mathematics and science report and all students in grades three through eight and 11 taking the

03:06:42.200 --> 03:06:50.680
casp test will receive pages one through four and for their ela and mathematics results and this is

03:06:50.680 --> 03:07:04.200
an example of a fifth grade student report next students who take the cast or the science test

03:07:04.200 --> 03:07:10.440
a california science test will receive a fifth page of their ssr with their science results

03:07:10.440 --> 03:07:13.400
and this slide shows the cast results for fifth grader

03:07:19.800 --> 03:07:27.400
california alternate assessment student score report this slide includes the results the

03:07:28.360 --> 03:07:34.120
scores for the alternate assessments all students in grades three through eight and 11 taking the

03:07:34.120 --> 03:07:39.880
california alternate assessments will receive pages one through three and then students taking

03:07:39.880 --> 03:07:45.400
the california alternate assessment for science will receive the fourth page and this example

03:07:45.400 --> 03:07:52.360
again is a fifth grader who took the california alternate assessment for science and all the other

03:07:52.360 --> 03:08:01.240
ones as well this slide includes the student score report for the california spanish assessment

03:08:02.040 --> 03:08:07.560
and i'll point out not earlier but now i'll point it out in the

03:08:09.240 --> 03:08:16.680
first page of each student score report you'll probably see this little qr code on the lower

03:08:16.680 --> 03:08:23.480
left corner parents and guardians or students or anyone can scan the qr code with their device's

03:08:24.440 --> 03:08:31.480
or a third-party app to access that additional information about the tests and currently the

03:08:31.480 --> 03:08:37.960
qr code and the link point to our california's starting smarter sites that are for families

03:08:37.960 --> 03:08:47.320
about how to understand their score reports then the english language proficiency assessments for

03:08:47.320 --> 03:08:54.360
california's student score reports the slide represents this the student score report for the

03:08:54.360 --> 03:09:06.600
summative lpac just two pages for fifth grader as well and then this particular one is for the

03:09:06.680 --> 03:09:13.400
summative alternate lpac student score report two pages

03:09:16.920 --> 03:09:22.200
and we're also providing the initial lpac student score reports which

03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:27.320
is also consisted on two pages

03:09:27.320 --> 03:09:38.760
and then this slide represents the student score reports for the initial alternate lpac

03:09:41.080 --> 03:09:47.160
and due to the timeline of for the design effort the student score reports for the initial lpac

03:09:47.160 --> 03:09:55.160
and the initial alternate lpac will be used beginning in the 24-25 administration because it

03:09:55.160 --> 03:10:03.240
does take that test already began in july right and here we are in september so we're going to

03:10:03.240 --> 03:10:08.600
use that current one for now for the school year and then implement it in the new school year

03:10:10.280 --> 03:10:16.120
so that brings us to the through all the revised student score reports

03:10:17.800 --> 03:10:24.840
and i just have one more slide and we do have a number of assessment program updates

03:10:25.880 --> 03:10:31.400
there's some for that are happening for this school year and that includes our

03:10:31.400 --> 03:10:37.480
interim assessments for the smarter balance ela mathematics the interim assessments for the

03:10:38.200 --> 03:10:43.720
cast and the l path and then an update on national or international assessments

03:10:45.320 --> 03:10:51.720
pretty much to help introduce educators to this to our state offer interims the cde has prepared

03:10:51.720 --> 03:10:58.920
a variety of resources and professional learning opportunities and more of these information

03:10:59.880 --> 03:11:05.240
about the interims and resources and trainings can be found in that our september item

03:11:06.920 --> 03:11:11.880
furthermore the item also provides an update on the upcoming national assessment of student

03:11:12.680 --> 03:11:19.640
educational progress of national assessment of educational progress or nape involving students

03:11:19.640 --> 03:11:26.040
in grades four eight and twelve and about 800 schools in california and then there's the teaching

03:11:26.040 --> 03:11:33.080
and learning international study or talus which is an online survey that will be provided to

03:11:33.080 --> 03:11:41.160
principals and teachers that will be offered to about approximately 30 schools and that kind of

03:11:41.160 --> 03:11:48.680
sums up this particular item and at this point i will pause and i'll be happy to address any

03:11:48.680 --> 03:11:56.760
clarifying questions or would you like me to go to the to the public comment we'll put the slide

03:11:56.760 --> 03:12:03.480
up for public comment so people can queue up while we ask clarifying questions so we'll now open the

03:12:03.480 --> 03:12:09.000
phone line for public comment members of the public mission to provide comment may do so in person or

03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:13.640
by calling the telephone number and using the access code provided on the slide that's shown now

03:12:14.600 --> 03:12:19.240
um and then while we're waiting for members of the public to call in i'll ask member of osco

03:12:19.240 --> 03:12:25.080
gonzalez she has any initial comments before me and then if there are clarifying questions

03:12:25.080 --> 03:12:31.400
we'll get those before we go to public comment okay so thank you mao and to your team this

03:12:31.400 --> 03:12:36.760
um comprehensive redesign and reporting enhancements to the casp and lpac students

03:12:36.760 --> 03:12:42.840
score reports driven by valuable feedback from students parents educational agencies and partners

03:12:42.840 --> 03:12:48.360
prioritize the clarity of test result reporting and ensure timely access to results for students

03:12:48.360 --> 03:12:55.320
and families the revisions made to language terminology and graph graphical representations

03:12:55.320 --> 03:13:02.040
are aimed to enhance at enhancing understanding and usability for all stakeholders furthermore the

03:13:02.040 --> 03:13:07.000
introduction of interim assessments for the california science test and the english language

03:13:07.000 --> 03:13:12.840
proficiency assessments represents a significant step in providing educators with valuable tools

03:13:12.840 --> 03:13:18.760
to support student learning these enhancement enhancements will contribute to a more effective

03:13:18.760 --> 03:13:23.640
and equitable assessment system in california ultimately benefiting our students and their

03:13:23.640 --> 03:13:29.160
educational journey i want to really express my appreciation for the inclusion of essay performance

03:13:29.160 --> 03:13:35.320
scores in the smarter balance ala writing extended response assessment the availability of these

03:13:35.320 --> 03:13:41.480
scores is a valuable addition to our assessment toolkit by providing these results and detailed

03:13:41.480 --> 03:13:47.320
information on each category scored for the genre this reports offers a deeper understanding of

03:13:47.320 --> 03:13:54.280
student performance it not only highlights overall proficiency but also allows educators to identify

03:13:54.280 --> 03:13:59.880
specific areas of strength and areas that may require additional attention this level of

03:13:59.880 --> 03:14:05.640
transparency and granularity in reporting empowers educators to tailor their instruction

03:14:05.640 --> 03:14:10.760
to meet individual needs effectively and also supports data-driven decision making

03:14:10.760 --> 03:14:15.400
at both the classroom and the administrative levels so thank you so much for all the work

03:14:15.400 --> 03:14:23.240
that your team and the department has done on this and i will just plus one to member

03:14:23.320 --> 03:14:30.360
roscoe gonzalez's comments and simply as a former english teacher a high school english teacher the

03:14:31.720 --> 03:14:36.920
elevating of the writing scores to me is extremely important writing is thinking thinking is

03:14:37.720 --> 03:14:44.360
writing and reading and writing are interrelated very strongly so it's a very good statement to be

03:14:44.360 --> 03:14:52.680
making that more visible in the process along with all of the other clarity and accessibility

03:14:52.680 --> 03:14:57.240
and usability that the score reports are you know bringing for parents and the public

03:14:59.240 --> 03:15:04.600
we have time if they're clarifying comments and then questions and then we'll go to public

03:15:04.600 --> 03:15:10.360
comment and then we'll have discussion and address the motion any clarifying questions

03:15:12.440 --> 03:15:18.200
all right i think we're going to go to public comment and are there any public comments in the

and continuous improvement system the action to implement the 2023 dashboard work plan and

03:21:21.800 --> 03:21:27.160
essa amendments and updates on continuing work for future dashboards and i will let

03:21:28.120 --> 03:21:34.040
cindy kazanis tell us what the recommendation is when the time comes because it's a really long one

03:21:34.840 --> 03:21:41.720
and it will be presented by cindy and kimberly mundeck of the cde take it away thank you president

03:21:41.720 --> 03:21:46.120
darling hammond and members of the board i'm cindy kazanis i'm the director of the analysis

03:21:46.120 --> 03:21:51.560
measurement and accountability reporting division this is another long item but this is the

03:21:51.560 --> 03:21:57.880
culmination of not only a year's worth of work but in some instances four years worth of work

03:21:57.880 --> 03:22:02.920
and so just to give you a brief overview of what we're going to be talking about today

03:22:03.720 --> 03:22:09.800
we have several revisions under consideration for the dashboard which will be out december 15th

03:22:09.800 --> 03:22:15.400
so we do have new statute we are very excited that we have a date that we can all point to

03:22:16.040 --> 03:22:22.920
and be ready for talking about how we can help schools and we can talk about the state of our

03:22:22.920 --> 03:22:27.480
schools and our districts you heard a lot this morning about how the data from the dashboard

03:22:27.480 --> 03:22:34.760
is used from l cap and so i'm hoping to be your throughput on the updates that we're again proposing

03:22:34.760 --> 03:22:43.400
for for this year and work that we're continuing on some of these updates do require that we amend

03:22:43.400 --> 03:22:48.440
our state plan for the every student succeeds act for some of you this may be the first time you've

03:22:49.080 --> 03:22:55.960
taken action to formally amend the ss state plan it has been well over a year in the past we have

03:22:55.960 --> 03:23:01.560
had these one-off amendments because of the covet provisions that have been provided by the u.s

03:23:01.560 --> 03:23:07.560
department of education so we'll give you just a brief overview of those items that will that are

03:23:07.560 --> 03:23:12.280
proposed amendments to the state plan and then we'll conclude with what we always do which is

03:23:12.280 --> 03:23:18.680
the great work of the team to get out the word about the dashboard and opportunities to learn

03:23:18.680 --> 03:23:28.920
more about our data and about california students so the item recommendation i think is is up to eight

03:23:28.920 --> 03:23:34.600
eight parts or seven parts so just bear with me i'll just do this once and then in the next go

03:23:34.600 --> 03:23:40.920
around we'll just refer to the slides so we are recommending approval of the english learner

03:23:40.920 --> 03:23:46.440
progress indicator specifically there's three pieces that will bring this into a full indicator

03:23:46.440 --> 03:23:52.200
first cut points for the english learner progress indicator change second we establishing our five

03:23:52.200 --> 03:23:59.400
by five color scheme for the english learner progress indicator performance colors and third

03:23:59.400 --> 03:24:06.360
inclusion of the summative alternative l pack in the english learner progress indicator for the

03:24:06.360 --> 03:24:13.160
college career indicator we have a recommendation around the removal of non-registered pre-apprenticeship

03:24:13.160 --> 03:24:19.400
measure from the college career indicator beginning with this school year and then there is a slight

03:24:19.400 --> 03:24:25.320
update because of the college career indicator and the lack of two years of data to adjust the

03:24:25.320 --> 03:24:32.520
eligibility criteria for differentiated assistance and then the last pieces are around adopting

03:24:32.520 --> 03:24:38.600
objective criteria for the priority one for our teacher assignment monitoring outcomes

03:24:39.640 --> 03:24:49.000
from this prior school year and then finally a couple of links around data that we are bringing

03:24:49.000 --> 03:24:54.280
onto the dashboard partly because of your recommendations others because of requirements

03:24:54.280 --> 03:24:59.320
from the legislature and we've already talked about the amendments to the state plan we always

03:24:59.320 --> 03:25:06.040
put this language in that we recommend that you make the adoption pending the spe executive

03:25:06.040 --> 03:25:10.360
director approval of final revisions because there sometimes are some topographical issues

03:25:11.160 --> 03:25:18.920
and necessary non-substantive clarifying edits so with that in mind we will get started with

03:25:18.920 --> 03:25:24.280
attachment one and you will hear from kim in in a bit but we're going to go through the english

03:25:24.280 --> 03:25:29.240
learner progress indicator which is really really one of the most important things that we're we're

03:25:29.240 --> 03:25:38.360
doing today for accountability and i would ask for direction from president darling hammond on

03:25:38.360 --> 03:25:46.520
winter pause for clarifying questions because this is a bit of a long item so just to frame

03:25:47.240 --> 03:25:53.480
the work and welcome to our new student on on the board the indicator for our english

03:25:53.480 --> 03:25:59.000
learner progress metric looks at progress for english learner students towards achieving

03:25:59.000 --> 03:26:06.440
english proficiency this is based on english learner students taking our our statewide assessment

03:26:06.440 --> 03:26:11.960
the english language proficiency assessment for california or lpac which measures how will they

03:26:11.960 --> 03:26:18.680
know and understand english so this is only for current english learners when this measure was

03:26:18.680 --> 03:26:26.120
first adopted that the board back in 2016-17 wanted to include reclassified students and that

03:26:26.120 --> 03:26:32.120
is was was deemed to be not in compliance with every student succeeds act so some of the things

03:26:32.120 --> 03:26:38.120
you're going to see today we're looking back at old data that did include rfebs this current measure

03:26:38.120 --> 03:26:44.280
does not and so that we are thankfully we're back in compliance with federal law but as a result

03:26:44.280 --> 03:26:52.040
there are some some tweaks to that that when we're we're part of this 2017 version that are not part

03:26:52.040 --> 03:26:59.160
of this current version so the metric uses needs two consecutive years of these lpac results to

03:26:59.160 --> 03:27:05.480
calculate status and then a third year to calculate change so it's a very unique indicator in the

03:27:05.480 --> 03:27:12.920
sense that we need that the three years of data so just briefly on the history again when i

03:27:12.920 --> 03:27:18.280
mentioned 2017 is when we first had it on the dashboard and that was with our old assessment

03:27:18.280 --> 03:27:24.280
the california english language development test or selt which has been retired and then i also

03:27:24.280 --> 03:27:29.160
have already mentioned i mean included our reclassified fluent english proficient students

03:27:29.240 --> 03:27:37.720
that was removed from from that metric in 2018 we shifted that assessment from the selt to the

03:27:37.720 --> 03:27:46.680
lpac and so we had been in transition 2018 2019 2019 again formula changed to exclude those rfib

03:27:46.680 --> 03:27:55.720
students to become in compliance with federal law so we have in 2019 produced the dashboard

03:27:55.720 --> 03:28:02.600
had status only and then we had covid and so we had a break and reporting on the dashboard for

03:28:02.600 --> 03:28:07.400
two years we've now had two years of data we're just having a third year this year and so that's

03:28:07.400 --> 03:28:14.680
why we are finally bringing on change cut points so back in march when we presented our work plan

03:28:14.680 --> 03:28:21.480
we talked about this being a part of a part of your decision points for the year specifically

03:28:21.480 --> 03:28:25.880
where we're asking you to do today's set the change cut points for the english run of progress

03:28:25.880 --> 03:28:35.640
indicator based on those three years of data we are using data from 2021 2022 and preliminary

03:28:35.640 --> 03:28:41.240
data from this year so you're actually seeing data runs that we've done with a file that

03:28:41.800 --> 03:28:48.760
incorporates students who took the summative lpac between february 1st and may 9th

03:28:51.960 --> 03:28:57.160
so in order to calculate the english runner progress indicator and there's a couple of

03:28:57.160 --> 03:29:02.040
different steps and so i i will not spend a bit not too long on this but just want to make sure

03:29:02.040 --> 03:29:09.320
that we're familiar with the methodology and how we we do this this work to establish current

03:29:09.320 --> 03:29:17.080
current status year we look at the results that we saw from 2023 and we also want to make sure

03:29:17.080 --> 03:29:23.480
we have established we have working out the results from 2022 we calculate change by subtracting

03:29:23.480 --> 03:29:30.920
2023 from 2022 or 2023 from 2023 you can see that in bullet two and then finally we do a

03:29:30.920 --> 03:29:36.840
distribution of those cut points from the leas that had a minimum number of 30 students of which

03:29:36.840 --> 03:29:44.520
we have 1149 leas and just in case you're keeping track of numbers janet this morning said we had

03:29:44.520 --> 03:29:51.560
a thousand leas for purposes of the dashboard we consider charter schools to be leas too so really

03:29:51.560 --> 03:29:58.280
it's it's well over 2000 potential leas that would be would have a minimum number of students

03:29:58.280 --> 03:30:04.440
of 30 but because english learners are concentrated in certain areas we're down to 1149

03:30:06.040 --> 03:30:11.560
so these are the distributions that were done by the team and shared not only with our technical

03:30:11.560 --> 03:30:14.840
design group but other policy groups that you're going to hear about in just a moment

03:30:15.480 --> 03:30:22.280
you can see the breakdown of by the percentiles of where we get to an even split at 50

03:30:23.320 --> 03:30:30.520
looking at change from prior year to current year the proposed change levels that we are asking you

03:30:30.520 --> 03:30:38.600
to establish today are for the five levels that we use starting with decline significantly and then

03:30:38.600 --> 03:30:45.880
to the highest which is increased significantly and the next slide does a really nice comparison

03:30:45.880 --> 03:30:52.840
of the 2017 change change cut points in the 2023 keep in mind the 2017 has a larger population

03:30:52.840 --> 03:30:57.800
because we were able to include rfps or we chose to include rfps and later had to remove them

03:30:57.800 --> 03:31:04.600
so this is very similar in keeping with what the board first established back in 2017

03:31:05.160 --> 03:31:12.520
so as far as feedback we have been talking about this and sharing this information with educational

03:31:12.520 --> 03:31:17.720
partners we always have several steps that we do when we engage with our educational partners

03:31:17.720 --> 03:31:22.200
first we take it to their technical design group because it doesn't meet the design or the technical

03:31:22.200 --> 03:31:26.360
standard if there's no use in shopping it to anybody else or sharing that with anybody else

03:31:26.360 --> 03:31:32.920
and so the technical design group provided feedback and recommended that we adopt the

03:31:33.160 --> 03:31:39.640
we adopt the change cut points that we presented to them which you see today we do have an english

03:31:39.640 --> 03:31:47.000
learner progress work group and there was not consensus on the methodology but did note again

03:31:47.000 --> 03:31:53.400
that we followed the established methodology process for setting cut points that is in line

03:31:53.400 --> 03:31:59.640
with our other state indicators and then the californ research advisory group or cpag which

03:32:00.600 --> 03:32:07.320
advises you the state board of education on issues related to title one was very positive

03:32:07.320 --> 03:32:16.360
about the proposed methodology so the second part of this adoption is adopting a color scheme

03:32:16.360 --> 03:32:24.360
for the indicator and the work plan through that work plan process we did simulations on two

03:32:24.360 --> 03:32:29.480
different two different grids first the traditional grid which we use for the majority

03:32:29.480 --> 03:32:35.800
of our indicators with the exception of graduation rate and academic graduation rate has a floor that

03:32:35.800 --> 03:32:40.680
we're required to use of 68 percent so when you look at the five by five grid for graduation

03:32:40.680 --> 03:32:47.240
it's all right at the bottom academic uses what what the board adopted back in 2017 which was the

03:32:47.240 --> 03:32:54.680
five which is a balanced grid is what we're calling it that was adopted in part because

03:32:54.680 --> 03:33:03.000
there was a lot of a lot of instability in the model for the traditional model and so the the

03:33:03.000 --> 03:33:07.720
prior probably the prior board i'm trying to think if any of you were still were on that at that time

03:33:08.680 --> 03:33:16.040
did adopt to change the color scheme so what you see for the traditional color scheme is this

03:33:16.040 --> 03:33:23.640
sort of even distribution of of four reds at the at the bottom left hand corner and on the top

03:33:23.640 --> 03:33:28.920
right hand corner four blues and then an even distribution of the remaining colors throughout

03:33:28.920 --> 03:33:36.840
the five by five color scheme the balanced color scheme is is is unique in that you only see two

03:33:36.840 --> 03:33:44.120
colors on each of the status rows so for the bottom very low you see red and orange whereas

03:33:44.120 --> 03:33:49.720
if we go back to the prior one you see red orange and yellow and so for the balanced color scheme

03:33:49.720 --> 03:33:56.040
especially for the academic indicator this did lead to again greater stability in the model

03:33:57.880 --> 03:34:04.920
this is the simulated results from again the preliminary data from 2023 and then prior data

03:34:04.920 --> 03:34:12.280
from 2022 and 2021 of what colors could potentially look like for the lp for the 2023 dashboard

03:34:12.920 --> 03:34:25.800
so for having again 1815 in our end size we see we see the even distribution between

03:34:27.080 --> 03:34:30.840
you know the distribution between each of these that are a little different so you

03:34:30.840 --> 03:34:39.480
for the traditional you see a greater or you see the equal number of of districts or districts in

03:34:39.960 --> 03:34:46.840
in the blue whereas for the red you see a bit higher almost or over double in the red

03:34:47.560 --> 03:34:53.480
so from the the when we start at the top they're even when we go to the green you start to see

03:34:54.120 --> 03:35:00.120
those numbers being pushed down on the traditional side to to yellow to orange and to red

03:35:02.280 --> 03:35:08.120
we also did additional simulations to see what the impact would be on our small local educational

03:35:08.120 --> 03:35:14.760
agencies which of which we have an end size of 631 again this includes charter schools

03:35:15.720 --> 03:35:21.640
we also looked at non-small schools excluding charter schools and then finally small schools

03:35:21.640 --> 03:35:28.920
excluding charter schools and this is these are the the configurations so if we go down to the

03:35:28.920 --> 03:35:37.160
bottom 631 lea's small lea's total we see they they start off at the same with

03:35:37.880 --> 03:35:44.440
even distribution between the two models of 114 and then end up with again almost double in

03:35:44.440 --> 03:35:52.280
in the red on the traditional same look and comparison for our small schools with

03:35:52.280 --> 03:36:00.200
excluding charter schools with an end size of 3876 again pretty much even distributions when

03:36:00.200 --> 03:36:06.280
we start at at blue and then subsequently you see how things start to fall out between

03:36:07.240 --> 03:36:08.680
green yellow orange and red

03:36:12.680 --> 03:36:19.560
for our non-schools non-small schools comparison excluding charter schools again same kind of look

03:36:19.560 --> 03:36:26.200
and feel with the blues being exactly the same and then the distribution changing as you get

03:36:26.200 --> 03:36:34.280
down through the colors with red being double for our traditional five by five so what does this all

03:36:34.280 --> 03:36:40.040
mean what we found and what the technical design group acknowledged was that both models were

03:36:40.040 --> 03:36:46.200
technically sound they did have a recommendation to adopt the balance color scheme because it

03:36:46.200 --> 03:36:53.960
seemed like a more stable way of of looking at schools and districts the english under progress

03:36:53.960 --> 03:36:57.720
work group did not have a consensus on the preferred color scheme i think they were trying

03:36:57.720 --> 03:37:01.960
to wrap their their heads around it but by the time we got to the californ patricia's advisory

03:37:01.960 --> 03:37:07.960
group this is all in a three-week period and really the the tone had shifted towards the traditional

03:37:07.960 --> 03:37:14.440
color scheme and specifically because it gave more weight for change on the overall performance

03:37:14.520 --> 03:37:19.480
color and so that is what we are recommending to you today is adoption of the traditional color

03:37:19.480 --> 03:37:26.680
scheme so with that in mind this is the traditional color scheme just as a second look at it

03:37:28.920 --> 03:37:34.440
and the final piece of the english learner progress indicator is inclusion of our summative

03:37:34.440 --> 03:37:39.720
alternative lpac and we are so delighted to have this very small group of students

03:37:40.360 --> 03:37:48.200
finally being seen on the dashboard so the work plan included are looking at the data the first

03:37:48.200 --> 03:37:52.840
time that we've had an opportunity to look at this information for potential inclusion on the

03:37:52.840 --> 03:37:57.960
dashboard of students who took the summative alternate lpac these are our most severely

03:37:57.960 --> 03:38:04.280
cognitively disabled students who are also english learners so these students what we needed to do

03:38:04.280 --> 03:38:10.200
was figure out a methodology that would work to determine that a student has made progress on

03:38:10.760 --> 03:38:16.680
or rather in english language development on the summative lpac from one year to the next

03:38:16.680 --> 03:38:23.000
and figure out a way to incorporate the students and have them represented in the 2023 dashboard

03:38:23.000 --> 03:38:30.040
for this indicator there were three options that were reviewed and developed the first being the

03:38:30.040 --> 03:38:35.160
performance level method second the scale score method and third the combination of both scale

03:38:35.160 --> 03:38:43.960
score and the performance level method so for option one we were looking at whether or not a

03:38:43.960 --> 03:38:48.440
student simply moves up the performance level or remains at the top level which is level three

03:38:49.960 --> 03:38:57.320
to show that they've made progress there was if you know the way that the english learner progress

03:38:57.320 --> 03:39:02.520
indicator was established around the summative lpac they actually split levels and there was

03:39:02.520 --> 03:39:07.720
not a recommendation to do that specifically because of a lack of data and technical

03:39:07.720 --> 03:39:15.080
information this is a a subgroup that is you know less than 25 000 students and so we are still

03:39:16.040 --> 03:39:21.640
learning about this test as as it's being administered throughout the years so with option

03:39:22.440 --> 03:39:28.040
the methodology that was considered is if a student increases their score by 10 points

03:39:29.080 --> 03:39:34.280
or remains at level three that would show that they've made progress the example that you see

03:39:34.280 --> 03:39:42.120
on the second bullet is a student that scores 325 in 2022 and 438 in 2023 would have made

03:39:42.840 --> 03:39:47.720
13 points in progress and would have count would then be counted as making progress

03:39:48.440 --> 03:39:55.560
the third option and I think came as a hybrid out of these two which was to combine both of option

03:39:55.560 --> 03:40:01.160
one and option two and what was what the recognition that option three provides is that certain

03:40:01.160 --> 03:40:06.680
students were excluded from making progress on either option one and option two and so this gave

03:40:06.680 --> 03:40:16.360
them the opportunity to be seen and included as being making progress so again bringing those

03:40:16.920 --> 03:40:22.920
two options together option three shows that a student or rather includes a student who moves

03:40:22.920 --> 03:40:28.040
up a performance level or remains at level three and then a student who has an increase

03:40:28.040 --> 03:40:35.960
in 10 scale score points from the prior year the simulations for this these different options

03:40:35.960 --> 03:40:42.280
show that at the very bottom for option three we have the largest percent or largest number of

03:40:42.360 --> 03:40:48.680
students who took the summative lpac they were able to show that they had progressed

03:40:48.680 --> 03:40:53.240
and I forgot to mention in the beginning these are all matched scores so you would have had to have

03:40:53.240 --> 03:41:00.440
taken the test the prior year and of course the current year or prior years rather and current

03:41:00.440 --> 03:41:07.000
year for both the summative and for summative lpac and then the regular lpac so that's why you see

03:41:07.000 --> 03:41:13.240
these numbers as being you know just around six six thousand on the did not progress and then

03:41:13.240 --> 03:41:17.640
the forty six hundred again these are preliminary results and so we don't have a full full file

03:41:18.280 --> 03:41:24.120
represented here but we are recommending option three again being able to provide as many

03:41:24.120 --> 03:41:29.640
opportunities for our english learner students who take the alternate assessment to show progress

03:41:29.880 --> 03:41:37.640
and as far as our our educational partners the technical design group I have these out of order

03:41:37.640 --> 03:41:42.360
from my prior slides but the technical design group did support option three because of this

03:41:42.360 --> 03:41:49.960
two paths to demonstrate proficiency and progress the english runner progress work group didn't have

03:41:49.960 --> 03:41:54.760
a consensus on the three options I think this was a this was a struggle for them to really wrap their

03:41:55.720 --> 03:42:00.120
heads around and then finally our california nutritionist advisory group or cpeg

03:42:01.800 --> 03:42:07.800
didn't didn't really provide feedback again this was I think this has been a difficult topic for

03:42:07.800 --> 03:42:12.120
for folks to to understand understand the actual assessment and then understand

03:42:12.120 --> 03:42:19.400
the inclusion rules so with that in mind I will turn it to President Johnny Hammond if you want

03:42:19.400 --> 03:42:27.960
to take clarifying questions on the three pieces of this indicator from the board I do think it's

03:42:27.960 --> 03:42:33.400
wise to take clarifications as we go along are there any clarifying questions that you did a

03:42:33.400 --> 03:42:41.320
very good job explaining it thank you cindy I think we're all with you at this point then I'm

03:42:41.320 --> 03:42:44.280
going to take a short break and you're going to hear from him okay

03:42:48.600 --> 03:42:53.240
hi everyone Kimberly Montaigne administrator of the accountability development and policy

03:42:53.240 --> 03:43:00.440
analysis unit thank you so much cindy I'm going to walk through the pile of work in our 2023 work

03:43:00.440 --> 03:43:08.760
plan that we contributed this year for the college slash career indicator as a reminder the college

03:43:08.760 --> 03:43:14.200
slash career indicator measures how well districts and schools are preparing its graduates on a set

03:43:14.200 --> 03:43:19.320
of college and career measures and we'll go over exactly what that entails in a further slide and

03:43:19.320 --> 03:43:24.280
the base of those students for the cci are the same as those that are included in our current

03:43:24.280 --> 03:43:29.320
graduation rate indicator so that includes both students who graduated in either four years or

03:43:29.320 --> 03:43:34.920
five years so our four or five combined rate is what compiles the students that we're looking at

03:43:34.920 --> 03:43:37.720
and the performance of the of them in their graduating year

03:43:40.120 --> 03:43:43.320
the measures that are included in the college career measure

03:43:44.120 --> 03:43:49.000
consist of both college measures and career measures and you can see the lini there for

03:43:49.000 --> 03:43:53.800
college measures presently the state board has adopted the following advanced placement exam

03:43:54.600 --> 03:44:03.080
ib exams college credit courses a3d completion or uccsu readiness the state seal of bi-literacy

03:44:03.080 --> 03:44:07.960
and performance on the smarter balance summative assessments additionally for career measures the

03:44:07.960 --> 03:44:13.640
state board has adopted cte pathway completion leadership military science pre-apprenticeship

03:44:13.640 --> 03:44:19.240
work state and federal job programs for our task schools as well as transition classroom

03:44:19.240 --> 03:44:21.880
and work-based learning experiences for our students with disabilities

03:44:24.600 --> 03:44:29.800
this year we set out with an ambitious work plan to continue to develop with our educational partners

03:44:30.440 --> 03:44:34.360
new career measures and review the indicator for continuous improvement

03:44:34.360 --> 03:44:39.320
this work actually started pre everyone who's sitting on this board right now

03:44:40.520 --> 03:44:47.320
there is a specific request made to add additional metrics per the career side right we had a very

03:44:47.320 --> 03:44:53.320
college heavy metric system so we were looking to see how we can introduce additional career measures

03:44:53.320 --> 03:44:58.840
in it so specifically we explored the inclusion of four career measures we've been gathering data

03:44:58.840 --> 03:45:05.240
on those four since 2020 which are internships student-led enterprise simulated work-based

03:45:05.240 --> 03:45:09.640
learning as well as arm services vocational aptitude battery tests or as fab

03:45:12.120 --> 03:45:16.040
additionally we have been ongoing and exploring this work specifically

03:45:16.760 --> 03:45:21.400
as president harman knows around civic engagement and capturing the information that our students

03:45:21.400 --> 03:45:26.520
are completing with regards to the seal of civic engagement as well as exploring industry

03:45:26.520 --> 03:45:32.440
certifications and then finally what we do every year is looking through and reviewing current cci

03:45:32.440 --> 03:45:36.840
career measures to determine if any adjustments are needed so this was all involved in this work

03:45:36.840 --> 03:45:44.360
the work plan for this year starting with the first large task was reviewing these four new

03:45:44.360 --> 03:45:49.160
career measures as i said which the work of collecting that data began prior to everyone's

03:45:49.160 --> 03:45:56.440
service on the board and has been ongoing through the covid epidemic and through calpats entire time

03:45:56.920 --> 03:46:03.080
now we need at least two years of data in order to be able to validly approve any career measure

03:46:03.080 --> 03:46:08.520
coming into the dashboard and following the review of this work and in completing the analysis of

03:46:08.520 --> 03:46:14.440
data we essentially come through and ask if the measure should be included in the cci is it

03:46:14.440 --> 03:46:20.280
something that we continue want to include and following that up with that if the answer is yes

03:46:21.240 --> 03:46:25.480
what are the prepared and approaching prepared criteria that need to be included for graduates

03:46:26.120 --> 03:46:32.280
and since the majority of the data collection unfortunately occurred during the covid 19

03:46:32.280 --> 03:46:38.520
pandemic the cd also asked educational partners whether an additional year of data collection

03:46:38.520 --> 03:46:45.800
which actually just finished up in 2022-23 should be reviewed and analyzed prior test preceding

03:46:45.800 --> 03:46:50.040
with further analysis and answering those questions and adding these measures to the cci

03:46:50.360 --> 03:46:55.560
specifically our educational partners replied that for cdg they recommended to wait along with

03:46:55.560 --> 03:47:01.800
the cci work group and the cpac agreed with those recommendations and to review the 2022-23 data

03:47:01.800 --> 03:47:06.760
before making any further decisions therefore at this time we have no further action or request

03:47:06.760 --> 03:47:12.440
of action on including these four new measures within the cci this year for the 2023 dashboard

03:47:14.200 --> 03:47:19.400
as far as exploring civic engagement industry certifications we continue to engage with the

03:47:19.400 --> 03:47:24.120
continue to engage in conversations with our work group and the civic engagement work group as well

03:47:24.120 --> 03:47:29.560
as the technical design group on necessary data points necessary for us to add to further data

03:47:29.560 --> 03:47:35.160
collections in the future so we will be proceeding with that as we move into the next cal pad cycle

03:47:35.880 --> 03:47:39.640
and then additionally we have looked through industry certifications and have continued to

03:47:39.640 --> 03:47:45.560
explore how we can integrate these or if we can integrate them based on feedback from lea's that

03:47:45.560 --> 03:47:49.560
currently have these programs in in operation for their students

03:47:52.840 --> 03:47:57.080
and then finally this is the big one and where action is is being requested

03:47:57.080 --> 03:48:02.920
is a review of the current cci measures and after a technical review of the current measures within

03:48:02.920 --> 03:48:08.040
the cci the career technical education practitioners proposed that they remove

03:48:08.040 --> 03:48:13.960
non-registered pre-apprenticeships from the measure and the reason behind this came from

03:48:13.960 --> 03:48:20.360
multiple lea's as well as staff here at cde because specifically there's no clear metric

03:48:20.360 --> 03:48:25.720
to discern what occurs within these programs at the lea's and there's really no accountability

03:48:25.720 --> 03:48:31.960
because these these programs are not validated by the division of apprenticeship standards

03:48:31.960 --> 03:48:39.320
so it's essentially we're looking at a checkbox and an opportunity for folks to put that in without

03:48:39.960 --> 03:48:43.080
anything standing behind it versus the pre-apprenticeship measures

03:48:43.800 --> 03:48:50.920
so just as a background in september 2020 which i don't know how foggy all of us are but

03:48:50.920 --> 03:48:55.720
the state board did approve the inclusion of both registered and non-registered pre-apprenticeships

03:48:55.720 --> 03:49:01.400
and we approve separate criteria for both of those types specifically the differences between

03:49:01.400 --> 03:49:06.600
registered and non-registered pre-apprenticeships are that registered are state recognized they

03:49:06.600 --> 03:49:11.960
require a linkage agreement with existing apprenticeship programs it leads to registered

03:49:11.960 --> 03:49:16.680
pre-apprenticeships and students actually receive a state certificate of completion which is the big

03:49:16.680 --> 03:49:23.080
one for non-registered pre-apprenticeships there is no state recognition or approval process there

03:49:23.080 --> 03:49:29.160
is no validity or quality assurance of any of these programs there's no required linkage of an

03:49:29.160 --> 03:49:33.480
of a pre-apprenticeship program and there is no required certificate of completion

03:49:33.480 --> 03:49:36.360
so

03:49:36.360 --> 03:49:41.160
we also went through though and wanted to make sure that the data that we were receiving on

03:49:41.160 --> 03:49:47.960
students who are participating in these programs if this was a you know very well engaged program

03:49:47.960 --> 03:49:51.480
well adopted across the state we didn't want to take something away from a bunch of people

03:49:51.480 --> 03:49:58.120
who you know were working through it and as you can see specifically our concern was with DAS

03:49:58.120 --> 03:50:03.160
schools because when we adopted it we thought that this was an opportunity for DAS schools to

03:50:04.200 --> 03:50:09.240
increase their number of career students career prepared students and as you can see from the

03:50:09.240 --> 03:50:16.680
numbers displayed obviously there was a severe drop off in participation for both 2020 and 2021

03:50:16.680 --> 03:50:21.560
as well as 2021 and 22 and that's obviously something we've seen across the board right

03:50:21.560 --> 03:50:27.080
this isn't just with regards to non-registered pre-apprenticeship in general it's just career

03:50:27.080 --> 03:50:31.720
education and opportunities for students to engage in career preparation at their school site

03:50:32.440 --> 03:50:39.480
however we don't see a really large engagement outside of the general population across all of

03:50:39.480 --> 03:50:46.200
our students so we even in 2019-20 we only saw 2,483 students participating in these programs

03:50:48.520 --> 03:50:53.160
across all of our different educational partners we received recommendations from the CCI work group

03:50:53.880 --> 03:51:00.920
and the TDG to remove non-registered pre-apprenticeships from CPAC specifically

03:51:00.920 --> 03:51:06.360
a few members voiced concern that if we removed this measure it might remove opportunities for

03:51:06.360 --> 03:51:11.480
schools so they requested specifically the CE make sure that these schools and LEAs that are

03:51:11.480 --> 03:51:16.200
administering these programs at current would be able to assist them to get registered pre-apprenticeships

03:51:16.760 --> 03:51:21.400
and we assured them that that we would be able to do so and then we also asked the alternative

03:51:21.400 --> 03:51:26.520
schools task force if they had any feedback on this and they did not provide any at that time

03:51:27.320 --> 03:51:33.400
therefore the CCI the recommendation for CCI is that we remove the non-registered pre-apprenticeship

03:51:33.400 --> 03:51:39.400
measure beginning with next year so I don't know if anyone has any questions on CCI fun

03:51:44.200 --> 03:51:50.360
I do have a quick question you mentioned that there's conversations going on around the civic

03:51:50.360 --> 03:51:55.160
engagement and the industry certifications can you give us sort of just a little framework

03:51:55.160 --> 03:52:01.240
how you when it when you expect to emerge from those conversations and you know when we would

03:52:01.240 --> 03:52:08.120
be thinking about those two information on civic engagement at the student level was not collected

03:52:08.120 --> 03:52:12.520
for the 2022-23 school year however we are engaging in conversations to be able to capture

03:52:12.520 --> 03:52:18.600
that for 2023-24 so this present school year at the student level however we we continue to collect

03:52:18.840 --> 03:52:23.880
at the student level however we we continue to collect general information on SEALS and

03:52:23.880 --> 03:52:30.120
LEA participation and have that information and we'll continue to use that as well as when

03:52:30.120 --> 03:52:39.800
we were able to grab the student level information to use that it to begin to integrate it into the

03:52:39.800 --> 03:52:46.920
indicator or just to use it as at present we have no student level data to utilize that that's where

03:52:46.920 --> 03:52:53.880
I got confused so so so hopefully hopefully we will be we we are in still in conversations to

03:52:53.880 --> 03:53:00.600
be able to add it to the 2023-24 data collection at the student level so you might be able to start

03:53:00.600 --> 03:53:05.080
collecting and what about industry certifications was that included in what you were just saying

03:53:06.280 --> 03:53:10.200
at this present time we don't have any way to capture that but we continue those conversations

03:53:10.200 --> 03:53:16.600
and with LEA's in order to find a way that we can not burden folks with additional data collections

03:53:16.600 --> 03:53:20.280
right outside of things and what's the best way to collect that data I would continue to work on

03:53:20.280 --> 03:53:25.720
that sounds like civic engagement is a little ahead of industry it is a little bit yes try to

03:53:25.720 --> 03:53:31.560
get the time frame thank you any other clarifying questions a member Yoshimoto Tauri and then vice

03:53:31.560 --> 03:53:37.560
president Claude Awards thank you I just wanted to reaffirm the the idea that we would be moving

03:53:37.560 --> 03:53:45.400
towards approved pre-apprenticeship programs primarily because of the linkage right to an

03:53:45.480 --> 03:53:50.920
apprenticeship program so there's a pathway for young people but can you reassure us that that

03:53:50.920 --> 03:53:59.160
timeline with the 2023-24 timeline is enough to do what the CPAC recommended which is to make sure

03:53:59.160 --> 03:54:03.160
that we don't lose opportunities for young people that might currently be in pre-apprenticeship

03:54:03.160 --> 03:54:11.320
programs so yes so so the big clarification is that this year for the 2023 dashboard right any

03:54:11.320 --> 03:54:15.480
students that had you know any graduates who had graduated with the understanding of you know and

03:54:15.480 --> 03:54:20.760
LEA's who had pursued this right they they will be recognized within the current status of the CCI

03:54:20.760 --> 03:54:27.320
yes so that will be fine and any students who have received that information and in their four-year

03:54:27.320 --> 03:54:33.240
career they're fine for this next up through this year yes so it's it's the the next year moving

03:54:33.240 --> 03:54:37.880
forward and we have assurances from the our career college transition division that they will be

03:54:37.880 --> 03:54:43.880
working and we've already made a few connections as well to be able to to help folks to gain these

03:54:43.880 --> 03:54:47.720
registered pre-apprenticeships yeah we have that data

03:54:56.520 --> 03:55:01.240
just a quick question on the registered pre-apprenticeship programs i know we're not

03:55:01.320 --> 03:55:09.560
looking at that data today do you happen to know if there was a drop in the number of students

03:55:10.360 --> 03:55:16.840
in the registered pre-apprenticeship programs as well just as we've seen in the non-registered

03:55:16.840 --> 03:55:22.440
pre-apprenticeship programs um i have not specifically looked at that information

03:55:22.440 --> 03:55:28.040
but i do know that career measures across the board as as we've just from speaking with the

03:55:28.040 --> 03:55:32.840
CCI work group right that opportunities to participate in those programs were just limited

03:55:32.840 --> 03:55:38.760
during during that time period so um i i don't know if it was the same you know one quarter as

03:55:38.760 --> 03:55:43.240
it was in the numbers that we saw um but i do know that there was an overall drop in general

03:55:46.200 --> 03:55:47.400
let's move on oh

03:55:50.120 --> 03:55:56.760
back to the seal of civic engagement do you have a sense of how many LEAs are rolling that out

03:55:56.760 --> 03:56:02.360
though or how that's looking statewide i don't have numbers from this year as well but um you

03:56:02.360 --> 03:56:07.240
know i know president darlin ham is very interested so i do make sure that when we bring back the work

03:56:07.240 --> 03:56:14.280
plan for 2024 um we will make sure that we add those numbers and share out a report um like i

03:56:14.280 --> 03:56:18.680
said as we don't have student level information but to show how how many LEAs are requesting

03:56:18.680 --> 03:56:29.720
seals and what the breadth of that is

03:56:37.720 --> 03:56:44.040
all right this this one's easy because you guys all know this all right

03:56:44.040 --> 03:56:50.600
eligibility criteria for differentiated assistance we've got this down um so just as a reminder for

03:56:50.600 --> 03:56:56.200
this year we are both we're going through level one with the support for all um as well as level

03:56:56.200 --> 03:57:00.760
two differentiated assistance for any district charter school or county office of education

03:57:00.760 --> 03:57:06.120
eligible based on the LCFF state priority areas and let me walk you through what those criteria

03:57:06.120 --> 03:57:11.000
are so that i can clarify and clear up what we are changing or requesting that the state

03:57:11.000 --> 03:57:16.760
board adopt for this year um we do have our 10 priority areas and each of those priority areas

03:57:16.760 --> 03:57:23.240
has different criteria which would qualify an LEA for assistance so for priorities what areas one

03:57:23.240 --> 03:57:28.280
two and three these are all local indicator areas so therefore the criteria is not met for two or

03:57:28.280 --> 03:57:34.440
more years um on local performance so in specific regards for all of our local indicators that would

03:57:34.440 --> 03:57:41.000
mean a not met last year on the 2022 dashboard as well as a not met for the 2023 dashboard

03:57:41.000 --> 03:57:45.320
and all of our LEAs right now are submitting their local indicators so that everyone has an

03:57:45.320 --> 03:57:51.880
opportunity to hit met um by submission of their priority areas by the end of this month the friday

03:57:51.880 --> 03:57:57.880
the last friday of this month i believe the 29th i'll just shout that out for josh um so there we go

03:57:57.880 --> 03:58:04.360
for priority area five we include um all state indicator under academic performance

03:58:04.360 --> 03:58:09.400
so the criteria for inclusion is red on both the english language arts and math tests

03:58:10.040 --> 03:58:19.240
or red on ela and or math and orange on the other assessment um and or red on the english

03:58:19.240 --> 03:58:25.080
learner progress indicator or the lb for priority five it's also the two state indicators you can

03:58:25.080 --> 03:58:30.200
either qualify via red on the graduation rate indicator or red on the chronic absenteeism

03:58:30.200 --> 03:58:37.000
indicator for our k8 leas for priority area six it is a combination of both local indicators

03:58:37.560 --> 03:58:42.520
and state indicators so it's either red on suspension rate or a local indicator not being

03:58:42.520 --> 03:58:48.040
met for two or more years um for priority seven it's not it's a local indicator not met for two

03:58:48.040 --> 03:58:54.680
or more years and then priority area eight in normal circumstances is a red on the college

03:58:54.680 --> 03:58:59.640
slash career indicator um priority areas nine and ten only apply to our county offices of education

03:58:59.640 --> 03:59:07.480
which are also local indicators um you may qualify for differentiated assistance based on having one

03:59:07.480 --> 03:59:16.200
student group have meeting the criteria in two priority areas so for example the hispanic student

03:59:16.200 --> 03:59:21.320
group could qualify if they are red in chronic absenteeism as well as being red in suspension

03:59:21.320 --> 03:59:27.080
so that would be priority areas five and six so it's same student group right lowest performance

03:59:27.720 --> 03:59:34.120
two or more priority areas you can also qualify simply by not meeting the local indicators and

03:59:34.120 --> 03:59:41.720
that is again across two priority areas so if you fail to meet the criteria and submit your local

03:59:41.720 --> 03:59:47.240
indicators on time for priorities one and two then you would qualify for local indicators only

03:59:47.240 --> 03:59:53.560
on method two and then finally method three is both a combination of local indicators being not

03:59:53.560 --> 03:59:58.760
met for two or more years as well as meeting the qualifications under one of the priority areas for

03:59:58.760 --> 04:00:05.720
a student group i want to remind everyone that charter schools this year are once again eligible

04:00:05.720 --> 04:00:11.400
for differentiated assistance the criteria however has changed since they were last eligible for

04:00:11.400 --> 04:00:19.240
identification in 2019 as such the um this year's criteria is that charter schools are required to

04:00:19.240 --> 04:00:27.160
meet in meet priority area information in two groups so while all other lea's are required

04:00:27.160 --> 04:00:31.800
in one year to meet the criteria charter schools must meet it in two or more years

04:00:32.360 --> 04:00:35.960
and that's either through method one method two or method three

04:00:36.840 --> 04:00:41.080
the change we're requesting from you today specifically is due to the college and career

04:00:41.080 --> 04:00:48.840
indicator being once again cell phone bars only and status only on the dashboard so therefore

04:00:48.840 --> 04:00:53.000
we need to change the criteria that state board has previously adopted for priority area eight

04:00:53.560 --> 04:01:00.120
and so currently it's red on the cci and we would like to change that to very low status on the cci

04:01:00.920 --> 04:01:05.000
on the cci and with that are there any questions

04:01:08.760 --> 04:01:10.200
i have a data point

04:01:13.240 --> 04:01:19.400
it looks like in 2021-22 there were 10 000 seals of civic engagement

04:01:20.920 --> 04:01:27.720
a year before there were about half as many so it's you know inching inching it's up it's way up

04:01:31.080 --> 04:01:31.960
for the numbers

04:01:40.040 --> 04:01:47.720
okay shifting the conversation to a different topic which is priority one and adopting objective

04:01:47.720 --> 04:01:55.480
criteria for the reporting of teacher data specifically this modification is being made

04:01:55.480 --> 04:02:03.960
to comply with education code section 52064.5 e2 and i think the the big big piece is just the

04:02:03.960 --> 04:02:11.880
bottom couple of lines that when we have access to state state level state level data which is

04:02:11.880 --> 04:02:21.560
reliable and relevant we the board needs to adopt objective criteria which may include but are not

04:02:21.560 --> 04:02:26.680
limited to extent of disparities across school sites within a school district or county office

04:02:26.680 --> 04:02:31.560
of education or performance relative to statewide data so in this recommendation today we're

04:02:31.560 --> 04:02:36.680
capturing the bottom pieces within a school site or county office of education and performance

04:02:36.680 --> 04:02:46.280
relative to statewide data specifically we now are able to comply with the first part of priority

04:02:46.280 --> 04:02:51.240
one which is around the assignment of teachers so the degree to which teachers of the school

04:02:51.240 --> 04:02:57.320
district are appropriately assigned in accordance with education code listed and fully credentialed

04:02:57.320 --> 04:03:03.480
in the subject areas and for the pupils they are teaching it's a mouthful but it is something that

04:03:03.480 --> 04:03:12.200
is required under education code and we have been reporting out now for two years so specifically

04:03:12.200 --> 04:03:17.320
i wanted to talk about some considerations because this is complex data and i know that

04:03:17.320 --> 04:03:23.320
the chair and others know this really well but for the remainder of the audience we have now put out

04:03:23.320 --> 04:03:28.600
two years of data for our teaching assignment monitoring outcome reports which we call TAMO

04:03:29.800 --> 04:03:37.480
and specifically for the 2022-23 school year of course the LCAP process begins well before

04:03:37.480 --> 04:03:47.080
we have a dashboard in january and that process LEAs were guided to review their data and to

04:03:47.080 --> 04:03:51.720
reflect on them and report out at a regularly scheduled meeting of their local governing board

04:03:53.560 --> 04:04:00.440
the TAMO reports have seven assignment monitoring outcomes clear, out of field, in turn, ineffective,

04:04:00.440 --> 04:04:06.520
incomplete, unknown, and not applicable each of these have their own unique definitions of which

04:04:07.480 --> 04:04:12.040
some of those definitions this board has actually adopted and is in our state plan

04:04:12.040 --> 04:04:17.080
under the Every Student Succeeds Act but i've given you that link and if you just did teacher

04:04:17.080 --> 04:04:23.800
AMO California it's the top search in google so we are trending high on teacher data

04:04:25.240 --> 04:04:32.040
so the considerations that we've been putting forward and had a really robust several robust

04:04:32.040 --> 04:04:39.480
conversations with educational partners on this topic is that the clear definition does of course

04:04:39.480 --> 04:04:49.800
align most closely with the the local indicator education code section which is 52060 which you

04:04:49.800 --> 04:04:56.520
can see on the screen referenced but that definition doesn't give credit to those that

04:04:56.520 --> 04:05:04.520
are in the pipeline those that are doing unique ways of trying to become fully credentialed

04:05:04.520 --> 04:05:09.000
in the subject that they're teaching and the pupils which are in their their classrooms

04:05:09.800 --> 04:05:14.680
specifically we heard about interns we heard about out of field educators we heard about

04:05:15.240 --> 04:05:20.840
just very unique examples that i know even our own superintendent is promoting to make sure we

04:05:20.840 --> 04:05:26.680
can get any available body who is interested in being a teacher to become a teacher so until

04:05:26.680 --> 04:05:31.880
they become you know until they're clear this this does not give that school or that district

04:05:31.880 --> 04:05:38.840
credit for the work that they're doing to become into that into that category so specifically

04:05:39.800 --> 04:05:44.200
we've talked a little bit about educators who are out of field of course they have a credential

04:05:44.200 --> 04:05:48.520
but they need to demonstrate subject matter competency in a new subject area and these

04:05:48.520 --> 04:05:52.760
reports really were i think very enlightening for some school districts who thought that their

04:05:52.760 --> 04:05:58.120
teachers were all clear and in second and in looking at the data a second time realized

04:05:58.120 --> 04:06:02.280
that they they didn't have the appropriate subject area they hadn't met

04:06:03.400 --> 04:06:08.120
their credential requirements for teaching english learners for example and then of course

04:06:08.120 --> 04:06:14.520
interns which i know is near and dear to president darling hamans heart there it's a great group of

04:06:14.520 --> 04:06:19.320
students who do have a degree they do have subject matter competency and they're working

04:06:19.320 --> 04:06:24.760
to obtain that credential so they are not in the clear category either so with these considerations

04:06:24.760 --> 04:06:33.000
in mind we do see a slight increase from year to year in the statewide data for clear we are at 84

04:06:33.000 --> 04:06:39.560
percent this third year of data i think will be very different we have not districts have not had

04:06:39.560 --> 04:06:45.560
an opportunity to actually reflect on these data after they were publicly released we had already

04:06:45.560 --> 04:06:50.680
finished our data collection when we put out the second year of data so this is the the complete

04:06:51.560 --> 04:06:58.840
complete report with the last three categories being grouped grouped together and then in terms

04:06:58.840 --> 04:07:04.440
of what is before you today we put together a couple of alternatives for setting objective

04:07:04.440 --> 04:07:09.960
criteria and we've added a fourth alternative after meeting with the educational partners

04:07:10.600 --> 04:07:15.000
so i'm going to walk you through just verbally the first couple and i'm going to show you the

04:07:15.000 --> 04:07:20.760
one that has become the preferred option so the first option being the statewide comparisons in

04:07:20.760 --> 04:07:26.760
the chart with a narrative box for leas to enter their information keep in mind that the local

04:07:26.760 --> 04:07:34.040
indicators exist they are adopted for leas they're not a school report that is that is by design

04:07:34.920 --> 04:07:40.120
the second option is the teacher data only in a narrative form and the third option is the teacher

04:07:40.120 --> 04:07:50.680
data in a narrative form with a metric being at above or below the statewide average so in terms

04:07:50.680 --> 04:07:57.400
of feedback we have we established last year an ad hoc work group around teacher data which is

04:07:57.400 --> 04:08:06.280
made up of very very passionate individuals who represent not only our our leas our practitioners

04:08:06.840 --> 04:08:11.240
those that look at assignment monitors are charged with assignment monitoring from our

04:08:11.240 --> 04:08:16.840
county offices of education but also those that represent our equity and our civil rights groups

04:08:16.840 --> 04:08:25.880
and when we asked for feedback we did get option one did seem to be overwhelmingly

04:08:26.760 --> 04:08:32.520
favorite by by the work group the california teachers advisory group was supportive of option

04:08:32.520 --> 04:08:38.280
one but they also wanted to see an additional column and comparison to the statewide average

04:08:38.280 --> 04:08:47.400
and so we did develop this extra option which we are recommending that you approve so specifically

04:08:48.920 --> 04:08:54.680
this is using a local example and this tax city is always you know they're always large enough so

04:08:54.680 --> 04:09:00.120
that's why we we I tend to gravitate towards them there was an article in our news clips of

04:09:00.120 --> 04:09:06.120
a school that had one teacher and thank goodness that teacher was 100 she was 100 clear but

04:09:06.120 --> 04:09:12.280
sex city gives us a variety of information and compared to the statewide average they are they

04:09:12.280 --> 04:09:19.560
are doing quite well for for their teaching population at 87.3 percent compared to the

04:09:20.520 --> 04:09:27.480
county average which is 88.3 compared to the statewide average which is 85.8 these are

04:09:27.480 --> 04:09:31.880
teaching assignments that's the other thing I should mention about this report is you don't see

04:09:31.880 --> 04:09:36.920
whole teachers right they're about assignments so a teacher may have six periods in a day or they

04:09:36.920 --> 04:09:42.440
may be in a self-contained classroom and so that is why the data reflects these partial

04:09:42.440 --> 04:09:52.520
numbers here what was what has been added as part of this option is the final column this comparison

04:09:52.520 --> 04:09:57.080
to statewide and we missed a word we meant statewide average so we'd like to add that

04:09:58.120 --> 04:10:03.160
but then the ability to have an optional narrative and this was really important I think you saw that

04:10:03.160 --> 04:10:08.760
in the letters that we received as part of this item from county offices of education who are

04:10:09.080 --> 04:10:15.640
teaching our most challenging student populations and may not have clear they may be out of field

04:10:15.640 --> 04:10:20.520
and there's an opportunity to describe what's happening in the local context with this optional

04:10:20.520 --> 04:10:28.920
narrative the other piece that we've added here is and it is cut off it doesn't it doesn't really

04:10:28.920 --> 04:10:34.120
allow you the opportunity to see this but the piece about for additional information that's not

04:10:35.080 --> 04:10:43.160
optional that would be a narrative that is at the bottom of of underneath the optional narrative

04:10:43.160 --> 04:10:51.400
that we can provide a direct link to the tamo reports that that also lists the data by school

04:10:51.400 --> 04:10:55.480
and so I know that there were some of the educational partners that really wanted to

04:10:55.480 --> 04:11:01.240
see some school comparisons and that is an opportunity to get us partially there

04:11:02.200 --> 04:11:07.240
so with that in mind I can continue to just finish I think the last couple slides if that's

04:11:07.240 --> 04:11:13.400
okay with you President Darling-Hammond and I can return the conversation back to you

04:11:14.120 --> 04:11:19.960
so the remaining pieces are mostly for informational purposes but they are things

04:11:19.960 --> 04:11:24.840
that were definitely left on our to-do list so at our last meeting we spent the entire session

04:11:24.840 --> 04:11:31.080
talking about chronic absenteeism and we presented a couple of short-term and long-term options for

04:11:31.080 --> 04:11:38.200
discussion and so today we are trying to follow through with that guidance in which you

04:11:39.080 --> 04:11:45.160
wanted to maintain the indicator as is the for methodology wise for the 2023 dashboard

04:11:45.160 --> 04:11:51.320
you asked us to explore collecting and reporting granular data on reason for absence and then you

04:11:51.320 --> 04:11:58.200
also asked us to provide for this dashboard a link to our data quest report on absenteeism by reason

04:11:59.160 --> 04:12:07.000
so just to follow through with that last piece especially because that is a 2023 action we will

04:12:07.000 --> 04:12:14.520
be we did we did solicit feedback from educational partners and we are recommending that a link be

04:12:14.520 --> 04:12:21.560
placed in the introductory text on when you get to the chronic absenteeism section that will link

04:12:21.640 --> 04:12:28.440
to that lea or school's absenteeism by reason report which is on a different website

04:12:30.680 --> 04:12:37.160
another piece that is continuing as as information for informational purposes on the dashboard

04:12:37.160 --> 04:12:42.760
is the information around our science assessments which is the california science test or cast

04:12:43.800 --> 04:12:49.240
a link to those results through the dashboard there has been a lot of support especially in

04:12:49.240 --> 04:12:54.840
the science community that this have a presence on the dashboard to recognize the importance of

04:12:54.840 --> 04:13:02.360
science and and as a result we are taking users directly to those cast results and so we are

04:13:02.360 --> 04:13:09.400
continuing that that practice from september of 2022 with your adoption for the 2023 dashboard

04:13:10.440 --> 04:13:17.000
and then you will see this back on your agenda in 2024 for how it actually gets included on the

04:13:17.000 --> 04:13:24.760
dashboard integrated in some way into an indicator or something something else and so we will have

04:13:25.720 --> 04:13:31.080
finally the necessary years of data to start doing simulations and start having conversations

04:13:31.080 --> 04:13:38.600
about methodology and and so on and then finally least restrictive environment was something that

04:13:38.680 --> 04:13:48.520
was approved by the legislature several years ago and required that we the department by november

04:13:48.520 --> 04:13:55.480
30th produce data on least restrictive environment which is for students people with disabilities on

04:13:55.480 --> 04:14:02.600
our website we also need to link it to the dashboard and so that work is is actually

04:14:02.600 --> 04:14:09.720
ongoing in the department we will have that report out by that deadline and the 2023 dashboard will

04:14:09.720 --> 04:14:14.200
will link to it and just in terms of where that information comes from lea's have been submitting

04:14:14.200 --> 04:14:19.480
this information through our student level data system for quite a long time but it puts puts

04:14:19.480 --> 04:14:25.640
this out there and as far as with where this data comes from it is part of our enrollment collection

04:14:25.640 --> 04:14:32.200
so this is information that we will we will have picked up in fall of 2022 we will

04:14:32.760 --> 04:14:39.240
disaggregate it by race and ethnicity just like we do all of our reports on on data quest and

04:14:39.240 --> 04:14:45.720
we'll provide that link from the main menu page of the dashboard one topic that you won't see on

04:14:45.720 --> 04:14:51.240
our slide deck because we ran out of time and i know you have a one day meeting today is around

04:14:51.240 --> 04:14:57.480
the gross model and i just wanted to mention that because this work has continued even even

04:14:57.480 --> 04:15:02.840
through covid and we are really proud of the partnership with our testing contractor with

04:15:02.840 --> 04:15:08.520
ets and the fine work that they've done so if you didn't have a chance to look at at the item i would

04:15:08.520 --> 04:15:14.200
recommend looking through what the contractor has done and bringing together focus groups

04:15:14.200 --> 04:15:19.720
and really looking at trying to develop out displays that would be useful for parents and

04:15:19.720 --> 04:15:25.480
different audiences they went through a lot of iterations and i would say it's still still going

04:15:25.480 --> 04:15:32.280
to be a work in progress as we move to have the board adopt the incorporation or decide how you

04:15:32.280 --> 04:15:39.480
want to include these growth scores in in the accountability system in future dashboards so in

04:15:39.480 --> 04:15:47.560
terms of all of these things culminating in amendments to the essa document there are a

04:15:47.560 --> 04:15:53.800
couple of things that are housekeeping so i'm switching over to attachment two and specifically

04:15:53.800 --> 04:15:59.320
a year ago it's probably been a year and a half actually the board adopted what was called an

04:15:59.320 --> 04:16:06.040
addendum for the consolidated state plan which was provided this flexibility is provided by the us

04:16:06.040 --> 04:16:13.880
department of education for the second year of covid and what that addendum provided the the

04:16:13.880 --> 04:16:21.720
state to do is to extend our long-term goals it allowed us to for a short period of time to change

04:16:21.720 --> 04:16:27.800
how we identified schools eligible for assistance and also to adjust our exit criteria because of

04:16:27.800 --> 04:16:33.400
course we had competing legislation from the state legislature that told us we could only use one

04:16:33.400 --> 04:16:40.520
year of data so what this action provides is for us to come into compliance when you pass that

04:16:40.520 --> 04:16:46.120
addendum that addendum also had a provision saying you would bring back pieces of those to amend the

04:16:46.120 --> 04:16:52.040
state plan so that puts us in compliance with what you've already adopted the other piece that these

04:16:52.760 --> 04:16:58.360
amendments also allow us to come into compliance on or rather to to fully build out is the english

04:16:58.360 --> 04:17:03.240
learner progress indicator so you would actually you will see an attachment three which is a

04:17:03.240 --> 04:17:09.640
separate attachment because it's now 174 pages long several data tables that have been added

04:17:09.640 --> 04:17:15.640
to reflect the recommendation from the department on adopting change cut scores on adopting the

04:17:15.640 --> 04:17:22.840
color grid and then bringing in the alternate l pack and with that i wanted to conclude by

04:17:22.840 --> 04:17:28.040
saying we continue to do a tremendous amount of outreach and i cannot underscore the work of the

04:17:28.040 --> 04:17:35.240
team led by kim and then ryan lamb to just get out in front of some of these things we know the field

04:17:35.240 --> 04:17:40.520
is once again anxious to see data to see data compared to the state can see data compared to

04:17:40.520 --> 04:17:45.480
their their rival school district or their rival charter school i'm not sure you know there's always

04:17:45.480 --> 04:17:51.640
there's always this interest in comparisons and so we already have our toolkit out for 2023 it is

04:17:51.640 --> 04:17:59.080
being built out by the day but we have done several and all these work group meetings that came to to

04:17:59.080 --> 04:18:04.600
the culmination of what you saw today we've had in-person presentations we're so delighted to be

04:18:04.600 --> 04:18:11.640
in person and then virtual meetings with a large one in august kicking off our season with over

04:18:11.640 --> 04:18:17.880
850 participants so we are out we're on the circuit this fall the conference circuit and really

04:18:17.880 --> 04:18:24.680
excited to get out the word about data the dashboard and how this really helps we hope

04:18:25.720 --> 04:18:30.600
improve the lives of our students with that i'm happy to turn it back to president darling

04:18:30.600 --> 04:18:33.400
hammond would you like me to shift over to the public comment slide

04:18:36.120 --> 04:18:39.800
thank you so much we're going to open the phone line for public comment

04:18:39.800 --> 04:18:44.520
queue and members of the public wishing to provide comment can do so in person or by

04:18:44.520 --> 04:18:49.240
calling the telephone number and using the access code on the slide that's shown now

04:18:50.040 --> 04:18:54.280
while we're waiting for members of the public to call in i want to ask our liaison vice president

04:18:54.840 --> 04:19:00.680
if she has any initial comments before me then we'll take any clarifying questions and we'll

04:19:00.680 --> 04:19:07.320
go to public comment and come back for discussion thank you president darling hammond i first would

04:19:07.320 --> 04:19:13.880
like to just start my very brief comment by saying thank you thank you thank you to cindy and her team

04:19:15.000 --> 04:19:20.600
just again a tremendous amount of work that has gone into the work plan being responsive to the

04:19:20.600 --> 04:19:26.440
board as well as reaching out to educational partners throughout our state when she said

04:19:26.440 --> 04:19:31.480
they're on the circuit they're on the circuit they are everywhere getting in the feedback

04:19:31.480 --> 04:19:37.880
and really trying to come to consensus with the feedback that's received so again cindy and team

04:19:37.880 --> 04:19:43.480
thank you so very much the only other piece i will add before we go to public comment is that

04:19:44.040 --> 04:19:50.840
again we have a lot of different components to this particular item that will require our our

04:19:50.840 --> 04:19:56.840
action but as i look at everything it's in alignment with those dashboard principles

04:19:57.480 --> 04:20:04.840
that we approved a few months a few meetings back and i think we are continuing to show

04:20:05.480 --> 04:20:09.560
that philosophy of continuous improvement where we continue to look at

04:20:10.200 --> 04:20:16.280
our dashboard the indicators that make up our dashboard and how to ensure that it best represents

04:20:16.840 --> 04:20:18.920
how students are performing in our schools

04:20:21.240 --> 04:20:28.280
and i will second that emotion and simply add that i think the other thing that we see in the work

04:20:28.280 --> 04:20:34.680
that continues on the dashboard is the effort to really think about education in a broad way that

04:20:34.680 --> 04:20:41.480
takes into account all the many opportunities that students are getting career in college and

04:20:41.480 --> 04:20:49.080
civic engagement as well as you know achievement and opportunities to learn and that we see this

04:20:49.080 --> 04:20:56.200
continual improvement both in the indicators and in the ways in which we're seeking to help them

04:20:56.200 --> 04:21:06.040
be used so it's it is a lot of work but it's very productive that was a lot we did stop for

04:21:06.040 --> 04:21:12.040
clarifying comments along the way or questions are there any other clarifying questions at this point

04:21:12.040 --> 04:21:19.240
before we go to public comment seeing none we'll see if there's anybody in the room who wants to

04:21:19.240 --> 04:21:23.720
make in-person public comment we have four individuals signed up for public comment

04:21:24.440 --> 04:21:29.320
shelly spiegel colman followed by jessica saco andrea ball and lindsay tornatori

04:21:37.080 --> 04:21:40.200
i think we need the microphone on or turned up or something

04:21:44.040 --> 04:21:49.720
got it good afternoon board president linda darling hammon board members shelly spiegel

04:21:49.720 --> 04:21:56.120
colman from californians together we support the recommendation to adopt the traditional five by

04:21:56.120 --> 04:22:02.920
five lp given the two choices however we regret not having the opportunity to review the status

04:22:02.920 --> 04:22:11.080
cut scores prior to this decision as exemplified by the following two examples when 45 percent

04:22:11.080 --> 04:22:16.920
of english learners in a district are not making the expected one level of growth out of the six

04:22:16.920 --> 04:22:23.640
lpac levels and they've declined for change that district is yellow which eliminates the need

04:22:23.640 --> 04:22:30.600
to address them in their l cap when 55 percent of the district's el's are not making progress

04:22:30.600 --> 04:22:36.920
and maintained without any growth also that district is yellow we are grateful for new

04:22:36.920 --> 04:22:42.280
elements in the l pen but when informed by the dashboard many districts will not be held

04:22:42.280 --> 04:22:47.880
responsible to improve the english language development instruction and program please

04:22:47.880 --> 04:22:55.000
consider scheduling an opportunity to review the cut scores and its implication on the traditional

04:22:55.000 --> 04:23:02.920
model thank you good afternoon jessica saco on behalf of children now president darling hammon

04:23:02.920 --> 04:23:07.880
chief deputy nicely members of the board i refer you to the lcff equity coalition for our complete

04:23:07.880 --> 04:23:13.560
comments on this item as a member of the ad hoc priority one teaching assignment data work group

04:23:13.560 --> 04:23:18.760
i've been grateful for the opportunity to work closely with staff and consider how the teacher

04:23:18.760 --> 04:23:23.480
assignment data might be included in the dashboard i recommend the board approve option 1a for

04:23:23.480 --> 04:23:28.200
presentation of the data on the dashboard with three key amendments first to create five bands

04:23:28.200 --> 04:23:32.120
to indicate if an lea's percentage of clear teaching assignments is above well above

04:23:32.840 --> 04:23:38.440
similar below or well below to include school level data with comparison to lea and state level

04:23:38.440 --> 04:23:43.720
data on school level dashboard pages and finally to include an equity component which at minimum

04:23:43.720 --> 04:23:47.800
demonstrates the disparities and percentages of clear teaching assignments among schools within

04:23:47.800 --> 04:23:57.800
an lea thank you thank you board president darling hammon board members cde thanks for the great

04:23:57.800 --> 04:24:03.560
presentation and all the work i'm here today on behalf of two organizations first the california

04:24:03.560 --> 04:24:08.600
association of suburban school districts the largest suburban school districts across the state

04:24:08.600 --> 04:24:13.320
and the central valley education coalition which is the county superintendents and district

04:24:13.320 --> 04:24:20.920
superintendents in six central valley counties both very diverse uh organizations i want to

04:24:20.920 --> 04:24:26.360
talk on behalf of both organizations on the english learner progress indicator thank the

04:24:26.360 --> 04:24:31.640
department and support the five by five table with the change in status scores i think this is

04:24:31.640 --> 04:24:36.760
going to be very helpful to show the progress or the work that needs to be done to highlight that

04:24:36.760 --> 04:24:43.640
work that needs to be done second on the teacher monitoring indicator we do support having the

04:24:43.640 --> 04:24:50.440
data as well as the optional narrative box again this is important for schools operated by county

04:24:50.440 --> 04:24:56.680
offices of education county superintendents as the department's presentation noted for those

04:24:56.680 --> 04:25:07.480
teachers that are in those optional schools thank you good afternoon lindsey tornatore on behalf of

04:25:07.480 --> 04:25:12.280
the california county superintendents we broadly support all of the cd's recommendations for this

04:25:12.280 --> 04:25:16.520
item and refer to you to our letter where we explain how each of the recommendations will

04:25:16.520 --> 04:25:21.080
benefit california students we would like to emphasize two elements during our comment today

04:25:21.080 --> 04:25:25.960
lp and the teacher assignment data for the lp we support the cut points outlined in table five

04:25:25.960 --> 04:25:30.600
because it values change and performance equally teachers need to monitor both to determine if

04:25:30.600 --> 04:25:35.400
students are making progress regarding priority one the cd's recommendation reflects california's

04:25:35.400 --> 04:25:40.120
goal of one cohesive state and federal system because it displays the teacher definition as

04:25:40.120 --> 04:25:44.920
required by essa and allows la is to provide local context in the narrative box which for our

04:25:44.920 --> 04:25:49.240
juvenile court and community schools is very important the federal definition is not the

04:25:49.240 --> 04:25:53.800
only criteria in california for determining if a teacher is eligible to teach finally we believe

04:25:53.800 --> 04:25:59.480
the cd's version of option 1a for the teacher for priority one meets all legal requirements required

04:25:59.480 --> 04:26:01.640
by essa and should be adopted thank you

04:26:11.960 --> 04:26:19.480
telephone comments okay uh good afternoon caller ending in 4544 please state your

04:26:19.480 --> 04:26:20.840
name and affiliation for the record

04:26:29.720 --> 04:26:38.280
okay next caller ending in 1 3 1 6 please state your name and affiliation for the record you have

04:26:38.280 --> 04:26:45.480
one minute your time starts now good afternoon my name is valerie salazar on the behalf of the

04:26:45.480 --> 04:26:51.400
placer county office of education we broadly support all of cd's recommendations and we are

04:26:51.400 --> 04:26:57.480
very happy to be able to answer any questions that you may have for us and we would like to

04:26:57.640 --> 04:27:00.840
we broadly support all of cd's recommendations for this item

04:27:00.840 --> 04:27:06.040
and particularly we support setting objective criteria for teacher assignment data and priority

04:27:06.040 --> 04:27:11.960
one and request the board adopts cd's recommendation we are in support of cd's recommendations

04:27:11.960 --> 04:27:16.120
displaying specifically the teacher definition and including a narrative box to provide the

04:27:16.120 --> 04:27:20.200
local context because it meets the essa requirements of the teacher definition

04:27:20.200 --> 04:27:25.160
and includes the narrative box to provide the so important local context this is critically

04:27:25.160 --> 04:27:29.080
important for county offices of education since many of our teachers in juvenile court

04:27:29.080 --> 04:27:34.680
and county community schools feature under under a local assignment option these teachers frequently

04:27:34.680 --> 04:27:40.120
teach in a single multi-grade multi-subject classroom and the definitions and narrative box

04:27:40.120 --> 04:27:45.320
are critically important to serve our transparency with our educational partners related to teacher

04:27:45.320 --> 04:27:52.600
qualifications thank you thank you next caller ending in 8744 please state your name and

04:27:52.600 --> 04:27:55.880

04:27:59.560 --> 04:28:02.440
good afternoon dr darlin hammon and board members today in a bill and

04:28:02.440 --> 04:28:06.600
request of the association of public school administrators i have to support cd's

04:28:06.600 --> 04:28:11.400
recommendation on healthy touch sports because it values students as well as performance it's

04:28:11.400 --> 04:28:15.800
important to have multiple qualitative measures that showcase students ability to learn in different

04:28:15.800 --> 04:28:21.960
ways to increase overall success additional tests also strongly support cd's recommendations to

04:28:21.960 --> 04:28:28.440
move forward with option one a lea county statewide comparison in part form and narrative box

04:28:28.440 --> 04:28:33.880
the priority one we believe that option 1a is the most apparent because as the chart form makes the

04:28:33.880 --> 04:28:39.320
data add a comparison clear which allows the public and community to quickly and easily understand

04:28:39.320 --> 04:28:45.640
the data the victim of the brief narrative allows la's opportunity to explain the circumstance

04:28:45.640 --> 04:28:53.640
around their data we'll celebrate okay thanks thank you next caller ending in 5116

good afternoon connie choi the public advocate on behalf of the equity coalition

04:29:04.920 --> 04:29:08.760
while we support the staff recommendation to maintain the traditional five by five

04:29:08.760 --> 04:29:14.920
matrix for the lp cut scores we also recommend one aligning lp performance standards of research

04:29:14.920 --> 04:29:19.880
expectations that even english learners with the lowest initial proficiency should be expected to

04:29:19.880 --> 04:29:25.720
reach the specific position within five to seven years and avoid being deemed as outheld and to

04:29:25.720 --> 04:29:31.000
avoiding masking underperformance by narrowing the range of a change ratings for significantly

04:29:31.000 --> 04:29:36.280
increased and declined from the proposed 10 percent change to something between five to eight

04:29:36.280 --> 04:29:42.680
percent to comport with agency approaches to other indicators for your consideration thank you next

hi peter ahern past president of the california association of science educators i want to thank

04:29:57.800 --> 04:30:02.040
the board for its ongoing commitment and support for having science on the dashboard we are

04:30:02.040 --> 04:30:08.680
gratified that cde's proposed work plans includes science or dashboard we are aware that this

04:30:08.680 --> 04:30:13.800
requires some technical decisions the science education community is excited to work with cde

04:30:13.800 --> 04:30:18.920
in doing this the best way possible to support all california students in getting the science

04:30:18.920 --> 04:30:24.280
education deserve a strong science education is a gateway to stem careers and majors which we know

04:30:24.280 --> 04:30:30.120
students don't have equitable access to currently districts have under investigated in science

04:30:30.120 --> 04:30:35.480
under invested in science and ngss and science is not on the dashboard and the dashboard informs the

04:30:35.480 --> 04:30:41.160
l cap also going back to agenda item three we're excited to see science prominently displayed

04:30:41.160 --> 04:30:45.320
in the casp reports and thank cde for this as well as further work on interim science

04:30:46.920 --> 04:30:52.360
thank you next caller ending in 6557 please state your name and affiliation for the record

good afternoon board president darlene hammon and members of the board this is

04:31:00.360 --> 04:31:06.440
seven accountability and data literacy to the los angeles county office of education

04:31:06.440 --> 04:31:10.840
i'm calling to express support for the cde's proposed english language progress indicators

04:31:10.840 --> 04:31:14.440
change cut scores as well as the use of the traditional five by five color grid

04:31:15.000 --> 04:31:20.360
in my role supporting lea's and understanding and utilizing the california ongoing continuous

04:31:20.360 --> 04:31:25.560
improvement process i believe that the consistent use of the methodology for determining cut scores

04:31:25.560 --> 04:31:30.520
across all indicators helps lea's to better understand how the dashboard is developed

04:31:30.520 --> 04:31:35.080
and to see it as a valid measure of their efforts in addition the reinstatement of the traditional

04:31:35.080 --> 04:31:39.480
five by five color scheme effectively reinforces the importance of growth in meeting the language

04:31:39.480 --> 04:31:45.720
acquisition needs of english learners thank you thank you next caller ending in 4333

04:32:05.800 --> 04:32:09.800
to our overall support i'd like to specifically highlight our gratitude for the recommendation

04:32:09.800 --> 04:32:15.000
concerning future assignment data for priority one cd's recommendations thoughtfully incorporates

04:32:15.000 --> 04:32:19.480
feedback from county office of education by affording lea's the opportunity to provide

04:32:19.480 --> 04:32:24.360
context for our assignment data this context is important for all lea's and particularly so for

04:32:24.360 --> 04:32:29.400
schools run by county offices where many of our teachers are appropriately and fully authorized

04:32:29.400 --> 04:32:33.800
for their assignments under local assignment options that are not specifically reflected in

04:32:33.800 --> 04:32:38.200
the federal definitions this recommendation for priority one presents an opportunity to

04:32:38.200 --> 04:32:42.760
offer clarity and transparency to our communities concerning future assignments and it helps us

04:32:42.760 --> 04:32:48.040
achieve a goal of maintaining a coherent state and federal accountability system thank you

good afternoon angelica salazar with public advocate and the equity coalition we appreciate

04:33:03.880 --> 04:33:09.240
the progress cd has made on the teacher priority one dashboard indicator option 1a is the most

04:33:09.240 --> 04:33:15.000
transparent but requires amendments to fully comply with education code first this indicator

04:33:15.000 --> 04:33:19.880
is required to encompass school level data the link offered in option 1a to the district's

04:33:19.880 --> 04:33:25.240
annual report does not reflect any objective school level standard and does not comply with

04:33:25.240 --> 04:33:31.160
ed codes reliable school level data has now been available for two years the equity coalition

04:33:31.160 --> 04:33:36.200
letter demonstrates how to integrate school level data into the dashboard that is legally compliant

04:33:36.200 --> 04:33:41.080
and that enhances user friendliness and community dialogue second there needs to be an equity

04:33:41.080 --> 04:33:46.200
component showing interdisciplinary gaps and access to clear teachers our partners at education

04:33:46.200 --> 04:33:51.240
plus west have developed simple mock-ups demonstrated an acceptable equity component

04:33:51.240 --> 04:33:56.120
that can be added to this year's dashboard third straight quintiles to indicate the degree to

04:33:56.120 --> 04:34:00.680
which a district is above or below the state average for clear teachers not just the two

04:34:00.680 --> 04:34:09.080
blunt categories that were offered this morning thank you thank you next caller ending in 6845

please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time starts now

04:34:15.000 --> 04:34:19.720
good afternoon lucy bollinger from elk grove unified school district we support the department's

04:34:19.720 --> 04:34:24.680
recommendation to implement the traditional five-by-five performance matrix it is important

04:34:24.680 --> 04:34:29.960
to keep lea's accountable and have high expectations hence at the same time we encourage the board to

04:34:29.960 --> 04:34:35.640
reconsider lp status performance standards because we feel the current lp status standards are too

04:34:35.640 --> 04:34:40.600
low and do not align with research-based expectations as a program specialist overseeing

04:34:40.600 --> 04:34:45.080
our district's newcomer welcome centers we recognize that it is all of our responsibility

04:34:45.080 --> 04:34:50.040
and privilege to serve our multilingual learners ensuring accelerated success our multilingual

04:34:50.040 --> 04:34:55.560
learners deserve high expectations quality supports and timely access thank you so much

04:34:56.200 --> 04:35:02.360

04:35:08.600 --> 04:35:13.720
hi good evening this is in one one rostro director of policy at california together

04:35:13.720 --> 04:35:19.320
and i'm calling focus attention to the large change range for increased decrease significantly

04:35:19.320 --> 04:35:25.720
that is currently on the lp it is currently recommended to be around the 10 change range

04:35:25.720 --> 04:35:29.960
we would encourage narrowing the change level to somewhere in the five to eight percent range

04:35:30.520 --> 04:35:35.320
for the significant change category this will recognize more lea as either having made

04:35:35.320 --> 04:35:40.680
significant progress or experienced significant decline and give more a more equitable picture

04:35:40.680 --> 04:35:46.280
of our district with schools to reflect on the growth or lack of growth for english language

04:35:46.280 --> 04:35:53.080
proficiency the 10 change range that is currently recommended is would constitute the largest change

04:35:53.080 --> 04:35:59.240
range if adopted on the dashboard for example other indicators range from a low of around two

04:35:59.240 --> 04:36:05.480
to four percent change range for suspension rates to a high of nine percent on college

04:36:05.480 --> 04:36:10.280
and career ready for the college and career readiness indicator again we encourage changing

04:36:10.280 --> 04:36:15.720
the change range it would allow more lea to be recognized for the growth thank you

04:36:17.800 --> 04:36:23.640
thank you thanks next caller ending at 8256 please state your name and affiliation for the

04:36:23.640 --> 04:36:26.200
record you have one minute your time starts now

04:36:29.240 --> 04:36:33.480
hi this is robert manwearing from children now i'm going to comment on the english learner

04:36:33.480 --> 04:36:41.640
progress indicator and chronic absenteeism first on the lp i want to thank staff for recommending

04:36:41.640 --> 04:36:48.600
the traditional method of adopting a five-by-five matrix i want to echo the comments of california

04:36:49.480 --> 04:36:56.280
equity coalition on these issues specifically i also wanted to link this conversation to this

04:36:56.280 --> 04:37:02.520
morning's conversation where it was noted that if you end up with a red rating you have a required

04:37:02.520 --> 04:37:10.840
action on your l cap right now the low performing category is it allows a district that has roughly

04:37:10.840 --> 04:37:16.680
just over a third of their their students making progress getting out of that required action

04:37:17.240 --> 04:37:23.080
um those districts tend to have half of their english learners become long-term english learners

04:37:23.080 --> 04:37:27.400
we're not setting the bar high enough for districts to focus attention on this group of students

04:37:28.440 --> 04:37:34.680
for uh chronic absenteeism uh there's there's going to be additional data reported i'd like

04:37:34.680 --> 04:37:39.240
to have there be some clarification on whether that will be reported also for high schools

04:37:39.240 --> 04:37:44.920
that are currently not part of the dashboard in terms of chronic thank you thank you thanks

04:37:44.920 --> 04:37:49.960
next caller ending in eight nine four five please state your name and affiliation for the record

04:37:49.960 --> 04:37:57.880
you have one minute your time starts now this is susanne from the carter schools development center

04:37:57.880 --> 04:38:04.760
hello again we'd like to see a growth model work plan that positions growth data to support school

04:38:04.760 --> 04:38:10.920
improvement and more robust school accountability we believe that strong state board leadership

04:38:10.920 --> 04:38:16.280
is going to be needed to steer the ship for ground sound strategic use of growth data

04:38:17.240 --> 04:38:24.440
our input on the lp decision reflects concern for valid meaningful data we support a balanced

04:38:24.440 --> 04:38:33.000
five by five because it downplays change especially for small schools is volatile

04:38:33.720 --> 04:38:39.080
partly due to the changing cohort of english learners included in the indicator from year to

04:38:39.080 --> 04:38:47.320
year we oppose option two assignment of no progress because mixing in a participation rate penalty

04:38:47.960 --> 04:38:53.880
undermines the validity of status we've seen this with ela and math where the participation rate

04:38:53.880 --> 04:39:00.600
penalty has eliminated a valid status score for those lea's that have happen to have many

04:39:00.600 --> 04:39:09.400
parents who exercise their opt-out right thank you finally okay thank you next caller ending in

04:39:09.400 --> 04:39:13.880
nine five six three please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute

04:39:13.880 --> 04:39:23.080
your time starts now good afternoon uh president darling ham and the board members john afel

04:39:23.080 --> 04:39:27.480
from public advocates and the equity coalition i want to echo the comments

04:39:29.000 --> 04:39:36.760
made by my colleagues in the equity coalition in particular i want to highlight and disagree

04:39:36.760 --> 04:39:44.440
with the staff comments that local indicators can only exist as part of an lea dashboard report

04:39:45.080 --> 04:39:53.000
somehow that's been fixed in stone by the state board clearly the legislature

04:39:54.360 --> 04:40:02.280
in 2018 which code has directed that the demo data at the school level for clear

04:40:02.920 --> 04:40:10.760
indicators should be reported on in the dashboard at the school level and we think that's

04:40:11.320 --> 04:40:17.320
easy enough to do and in the spirit of continuous improvement it's really important to convey

04:40:19.560 --> 04:40:25.240
clear objective criteria at the school level on school level dashboards we appreciate your

04:40:25.240 --> 04:40:30.760
consideration thank you next caller ending in seven three two eight please state your

04:40:34.360 --> 04:40:37.960
so

04:40:37.960 --> 04:40:44.360
hey my name is al macho and i am a local channel and i've been um somewhat disappointed with

04:40:44.360 --> 04:40:51.720
lbsd and sort of um awesome for students so i'm in uh very local uh very much supportive of uh

04:40:51.720 --> 04:40:58.600
parents choice i hope that you can consider uh just a petition uh to expand their

04:40:59.560 --> 04:41:05.720
okay i'm sorry excuse me caller sorry to interrupt uh we're currently taking public

04:41:05.720 --> 04:41:10.600
comment for item number eight can you please call back when we take up the item that you wish to

04:41:10.600 --> 04:41:18.200
speak to thank you oh sorry about that no worries and that concludes public comment for item eight

04:41:20.360 --> 04:41:27.960
okay um thank you very much we're now open for board discussion uh and we do um

04:41:29.480 --> 04:41:32.200
probably want to put up the recommendation slide as well

04:41:36.520 --> 04:41:45.080
any questions or two slides yes spilled over part two i can go to part two but we'll put up part one

04:41:45.080 --> 04:41:51.000
and then maybe show us part two so people remember the other parts we've got so that's okay we've got

04:41:51.000 --> 04:41:59.080
cci differentiated assistance eligibility criteria and then part two is around um the tam of data

04:41:59.080 --> 04:42:05.080
and setting objective criteria as well as um for informational purposes the links to additional

04:42:05.080 --> 04:42:09.720
outside data and finally your the amendments that need to be incorporated into the every student

04:42:09.720 --> 04:42:16.120
succeeds act state plan thank you any further questions or discussion

04:42:16.120 --> 04:42:22.360
uh and actually i think it's more of a comment than than discussion um first i definitely support

04:42:22.360 --> 04:42:28.600
the cde's recommendation um again appreciate the work that's been done with that um i just wanted to

04:42:29.160 --> 04:42:36.920
highlight the teacher assignment data option um thank you for again receiving the feedback that

04:42:36.920 --> 04:42:43.640
was made by the board of trustees and the board of trustees and the board of trustees and the board of

04:42:43.960 --> 04:42:49.880
again receiving the feedback that was given on all of that i think it's a very inclusive way

04:42:50.440 --> 04:42:56.600
to ensure that data is accurately represented for this particular indicator as well as providing

04:42:56.600 --> 04:43:03.880
space for adding local context as it relates to that particular um indicator so thank you very

04:43:03.880 --> 04:43:13.480
much i am going to just say as we think about future work plans um i am interested in knowing

04:43:13.480 --> 04:43:20.840
about the impact on the pre-apprenticeship programs for students as we've kind of moved out of the

04:43:20.840 --> 04:43:27.560
pandemic phase and um we have students that are back in school but i do know our high schools

04:43:27.560 --> 04:43:34.120
are now starting later so i am interested in knowing if that late start time has any impact

04:43:34.680 --> 04:43:40.600
on students ability to participate in these uh pre-apprenticeship programs considering

04:43:41.160 --> 04:43:44.920
when they're in school and when they're getting out of school and things along that line i

04:43:44.920 --> 04:43:49.720
realize the start time is not within the purview of this board i want to be very clear but

04:43:49.720 --> 04:43:57.080
i am interested on how that impacts the data that we are seeing on the dashboard itself

04:43:58.040 --> 04:44:04.280
um the other piece um i just wanted to say is that uh again appreciative of those links to

04:44:04.280 --> 04:44:12.120
data quest to provide those deeper dives into data and um i think that as we now have an lp

04:44:12.120 --> 04:44:20.040
five by five grid that is representative of status and change as we think about future work plans and

04:44:20.040 --> 04:44:26.680
what that looks like we can then consider if it's necessary to revisit the conversation on cut

04:44:26.680 --> 04:44:34.040
scores but i felt it was really important for us to first have a status and change grid for this

04:44:34.040 --> 04:44:40.120
particular indicator and then we can start to look at other data and see if other adjustments

04:44:40.120 --> 04:44:47.800
need to be made down the road thank you member oaken and then member yoshimoto tari

04:44:50.120 --> 04:44:55.560
thank you for this clear presentation of a lot of really good work appreciate it

04:44:57.320 --> 04:45:04.520
hopefully my question will be clearer than my brain is um but so my question is about the

04:45:05.800 --> 04:45:14.360
two different um color scheme options for the for lp um so it's sort of it's two questions um

04:45:15.160 --> 04:45:22.360
the first one is i in the note on slide 26 it says that the that cpag supported

04:45:23.320 --> 04:45:27.960
the use of the traditional color scheme because it gives more weight to change on the overall

04:45:28.760 --> 04:45:35.480
performance color and i was just wondering if you'd explain why that one gives more

04:45:35.480 --> 04:45:40.280
weight to change it's probably obvious but i'd love to just understand is it because more

04:45:42.120 --> 04:45:46.040
i don't know i'll wait slide 26 yep

04:45:46.040 --> 04:45:55.000
it was sort of when the change got made to

04:45:57.800 --> 04:46:01.320
favoring the traditional as opposed to the balanced yeah

04:46:03.560 --> 04:46:08.920
sorry i don't there's no slide numbers on this oh i think it's the next one go down one more

04:46:08.920 --> 04:46:16.840
one more one more oh gosh it's close you're very close

04:46:19.880 --> 04:46:28.440
it was your educational partner's feedback slide oh okay i'm sorry yes i can goodbye sorry

04:46:31.160 --> 04:46:34.680
yeah i just didn't understand why that gives more weight to change

04:46:38.920 --> 04:46:42.200
so sorry

04:46:46.680 --> 04:46:52.520
i think you just want the traditional five by five there yes all right the the easiest

04:46:52.520 --> 04:46:59.000
road to look at is high and if we're comparing traditional versus balanced right on high you see

04:46:59.000 --> 04:47:06.360
four colors represented orange yellow green and blue so as you can see change right your

04:47:06.360 --> 04:47:11.320
performance on change is going to drop is going to put you in one of four colors you have the

04:47:11.320 --> 04:47:17.480
opportunity on that row right to achieve any of those colors whereas on balance if we go way back

04:47:18.760 --> 04:47:25.480
there's only two options on the high got it your color scheme options on the balance five by five

04:47:25.480 --> 04:47:31.320
across on the row right so status you only ever have two options so within balance with the

04:47:31.320 --> 04:47:36.200
traditional you have up to four and on most rows you have three

04:47:39.720 --> 04:47:46.440
okay thank you may i add a question to your question yeah yeah say one of the commenters

04:47:46.440 --> 04:47:53.240
talked about the instability of you know growth scores for small schools and how does that factor

04:47:53.240 --> 04:48:04.600
in how are we thinking about that correct so what in other indicators how we've factored that in is

04:48:04.600 --> 04:48:09.480
the board has adopted a three by five grid there has not been an adoption of a three by five grid

04:48:10.040 --> 04:48:16.920
for this purpose if there's interest in the department exploring that for the 2024 dashboard

04:48:16.920 --> 04:48:21.800
i mean i think to member glubber woods comments this this is a continuous improvement system

04:48:21.800 --> 04:48:28.040
and if there's things in the data that are you know not playing out that we saw in the sim that

04:48:28.040 --> 04:48:34.760
you know we did simulations based on preliminary data happy to happy to bring those those those

04:48:34.760 --> 04:48:40.920
back but at this point there is you know a slight impact on on small on the smalls

04:48:42.680 --> 04:48:49.400
which inevitably means they'll get support they'll get more support for this population of students

04:48:50.360 --> 04:48:52.280
it's they're identified

04:48:58.520 --> 04:49:04.680
yeah thank you so my second question it's still on this just trying to get my head around it so

04:49:05.640 --> 04:49:15.880
the traditional model puts more weight on change and it also if i looked at those

04:49:16.840 --> 04:49:25.720
the tables how many schools are identified in each color level there's quite a few more

04:49:25.720 --> 04:49:33.400
in the traditional who are identified in red can you just explain and if

04:49:34.920 --> 04:49:40.680
if you're not the right well can you explain what the practical impact is of that if there are

04:49:40.680 --> 04:49:48.120
are twice or three times as many schools identified in red i i hear from the comments

04:49:48.120 --> 04:49:56.840
one of them one practical implication is that the this the achievement and progress of students

04:49:56.840 --> 04:50:03.240
will have to be addressed in the l cap so i got that one are there other practical implications

04:50:03.240 --> 04:50:09.400
such as the need for assistance for schools or anything else like that

04:50:10.840 --> 04:50:19.960
so it depends is probably the short answer if if there's another indicator that the lea

04:50:20.600 --> 04:50:27.000
is underperforming on under the differentiated assistance criteria for that same student group

04:50:27.000 --> 04:50:31.240
which of course is english learners they could be eligible for differentiated assistance

04:50:32.040 --> 04:50:37.800
at for for schools of course under the every student succeeds act we we have some slightly

04:50:37.800 --> 04:50:43.160
different criteria and they could be identified for for support if you're a comprehensive

04:50:43.960 --> 04:50:49.640
improvement school a csi school you could get money you have a planning process there's a support

04:50:49.640 --> 04:50:56.680
system around you and with the htsi identification again there's a planning process as well

04:50:56.760 --> 04:51:04.520
um based on school identification so uh you know if anything um it raises this group to

04:51:04.520 --> 04:51:11.240
to a level that um districts and and schools are paying greater potentially greater attention to

04:51:11.240 --> 04:51:18.280
them thanks and that that that that echoes what we heard in many of the calls so that's just

04:51:18.280 --> 04:51:25.800
helpful to hear thank you are there other questions or comments before we get to a motion

04:51:27.000 --> 04:51:29.640
um member yashima otari

04:51:32.200 --> 04:51:38.200
thank you again for all the input that uh and thought that went into this um while i'm going

04:51:38.200 --> 04:51:44.280
to support the recommendations today i i just wanted to second what vice president cleverwood

04:51:44.280 --> 04:51:51.160
said about the the lp that we're moving a step in the right direction by adding the the change so

04:51:51.160 --> 04:51:56.840
we have status and change um but i am i just want to mark the the couple of comments i talked

04:51:56.840 --> 04:52:04.840
about needing to raise expectations for the lp primarily because um we we know that the impact

04:52:04.840 --> 04:52:11.320
on young people needing to reclassify in a timely way is really important so i just asked that

04:52:11.320 --> 04:52:15.960
in the future we wanted to do that really carefully and that we come back as a board

04:52:15.960 --> 04:52:20.920
and revisit that when the time's appropriate because um they're

04:52:23.240 --> 04:52:29.800
when young people get to middle school who are learning english their schedule is impacted by

04:52:29.800 --> 04:52:35.480
whether or not they are in the english learner program or not so that adequate progress that

04:52:35.480 --> 04:52:41.080
yearly progress is really important so just something to note for the future uh thank you

04:52:41.560 --> 04:52:46.520
all right if there are no further questions i'd like to see if we can move towards a motion

04:52:47.320 --> 04:52:53.480
um and we can put that recommendation back up there if you don't mind uh yes vice president

04:52:53.480 --> 04:53:00.360
cleverwood's and and just to clarify in making the motion do i need to um articulate each of the

04:53:00.360 --> 04:53:11.000
bullet points thank you okay okay thank you well i i move that we approve the uh the

04:53:11.080 --> 04:53:19.400
department's recommended recommendations as outlined before us and um that is my motion

04:53:21.080 --> 04:53:27.480

04:59:54.040 --> 05:00:00.040
a written submission of its appeal which includes allegations with citations to the documentary

05:00:00.040 --> 05:00:07.880
record of abuse of discretion by the governing board of the la usd and the lack fo vista legacies

05:00:07.880 --> 05:00:14.200
charter petition the documentary record from the la usd which included the district's findings

05:00:14.200 --> 05:00:21.240
in support of denial the documentary record from the lack fo which included the county's findings

05:00:21.240 --> 05:00:26.920
in support of denial supporting documentation from vista legacy

05:00:30.760 --> 05:00:36.600
conclusion and recommendation based on the cde's review of the petitioner's written submission

05:00:37.240 --> 05:00:44.600
and the findings and documentary record from the la usd and the lack fo the cde finds that

05:00:44.600 --> 05:00:54.360
the appeal presents sufficient evidence for the sbe to hear the appeal pursuant to ed code 47605

05:00:54.360 --> 05:01:01.320
k2d therefore the cde recommends that the sbe hear the vista legacy appeal

05:01:02.280 --> 05:01:07.800
at its august meeting the accs in alignment with the cde's recommendation

05:01:08.280 --> 05:01:14.840
moved to recommend that the sbe hear the vista legacy appeal the motion passed unanimously

05:01:20.840 --> 05:01:23.320

05:02:11.560 --> 05:02:18.120
members before we go to public comment thank you president darling hammon i just wanted to

05:02:18.840 --> 05:02:26.040
reiterate the recommendation from cde there is sufficient evidence as we've seen in the item

05:02:26.680 --> 05:02:34.440
to hear the appeal and i just wanted to underscore that number oaken

05:02:40.120 --> 05:02:46.760
i guess the only thing i would add is just the reminder that this item is solely to determine

05:02:46.760 --> 05:02:54.360
whether we will hear the appeal or summarily deny the appeal and so we're not actually

05:02:55.400 --> 05:03:01.240
weighing the evidence we're just affirming that there's enough whether there's enough evidence to

05:03:01.240 --> 05:03:10.680
proceed so and and it was both and as we know both the department of education and the advisor

05:03:10.680 --> 05:03:17.160

there we go

05:03:41.240 --> 05:03:48.280
good afternoon john lemmo here on behalf of district charter public schools there's a valid

05:03:48.280 --> 05:03:54.680
appeal that's been presented your advisory body the accs has unanimously recommended that you

05:03:54.680 --> 05:04:00.040
hear this appeal your staff has recommended that you hear the appeal it's sort of a peculiarity

05:04:00.040 --> 05:04:04.600
of the statute that you split this into two items you know an item 9 and item 10 but we

05:04:04.600 --> 05:04:08.840
urge you to hear the appeal all the documentation is before you and we're ready to move on to item

05:04:08.840 --> 05:04:21.160
10 thank you good afternoon state board of education members my name is lorraine richards

05:04:21.160 --> 05:04:27.240
i'm a classroom teacher representing the california teachers association av 1505 established an abuse

05:04:27.240 --> 05:04:33.320
of discretion standard that is most deferential standard of review under which the state board

05:04:33.320 --> 05:04:38.360
must give difference to the decision of the governing board of the school district and the

05:04:38.360 --> 05:04:44.600
county board of education to deny the petition despite this we continue to see charter petitions

05:04:44.600 --> 05:04:51.560
appeal to the state board because they simply do not agree with the outcomes of robust local analysis

05:04:51.560 --> 05:04:57.240
deliberation and governance not because of true abuse of discretion in this case there is not

05:04:57.240 --> 05:05:02.600
sufficient evidence within the documentary record that an abusive discussion occurred the fact that

05:05:02.600 --> 05:05:07.560
the petitioner disagrees with the local district and county board is not sufficient evidence cta

05:05:07.560 --> 05:05:16.360
urges the board to deny the petitioner's abusive appeal thank you thank you is there any public

Hello, my name is Susan Mott with Generation Now Initiative that is at the Vista K-12 school network

05:11:39.240 --> 05:11:45.720
and I request that the board hear out this petition as we have been working with Vista

05:11:45.720 --> 05:11:51.640
for the past three years and have experienced excellent results in working with them. Our

05:11:51.640 --> 05:11:56.360
goal is to prepare young people for life in the 21st century by providing them the knowledge,

05:11:56.360 --> 05:12:01.880
skills, and experiences needed to find the solutions for the sustainability of our planet.

05:12:01.880 --> 05:12:09.960
We have been invited with Vista by the University of California at Irvine to participate in the

05:12:09.960 --> 05:12:15.320
launch of the ECLIP, the UC and CSU systems environmental and climate change projects

05:12:15.320 --> 05:12:22.840
in 2023. We feel that this would be an excellent program moving forward with the Vista

05:12:22.840 --> 05:12:28.680
public charter schools network and as they were selected to be one of their main speakers at this

05:12:28.760 --> 05:12:34.840
past ECLIP event representing all young people of this generation who are taking action to create

05:12:34.840 --> 05:12:42.360
a sustainable planet. Once again, please we appreciate you listening to this petition

05:12:42.360 --> 05:12:49.480
and hope that it will receive good results. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller ending in 7771

Hello, my name is Jasmine Aguilera. I am a parent of three children whom attempt Vista Condor,

05:13:01.640 --> 05:13:07.080
Vista Heritage, and Vista Meridian. I came to know of Vista schools on a Saturday before the

05:13:07.080 --> 05:13:12.520
school year started. My children were enrolled the following Monday. My high schooler was struggling

05:13:12.520 --> 05:13:19.000
with basic math and reading. He is now taking AP classes in AP US history and is performing as he

05:13:19.800 --> 05:13:26.360
should be academically at Vista. Please approve Vista Legacy Global Academy. The children in LA

05:13:26.360 --> 05:13:34.360
also deserve a high school like this one. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller ending in 9633 please

My name is Maria Lopez. I'm calling on behalf of Vista Legacy. I have kids that study here in LA

05:14:21.160 --> 05:14:26.120
and I'm very happy about the opportunity that Legacy is offering them. My kids are in great

05:14:26.120 --> 05:14:28.680
depression. And now, continue, please.

05:14:28.680 --> 05:14:58.440
They've offered counseling to my kids. Also,

05:14:58.440 --> 05:15:04.440
they offer sports and then necessary credits to finish high school. I would like to for

05:15:04.440 --> 05:15:08.360
my kids and other kids of the community to continue having these opportunities

05:15:08.360 --> 05:15:17.240
to study in these great schools. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller ending in 8945. Please

state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

05:15:21.400 --> 05:15:28.680
Hi, this is Suzanne Cooey from the Charter Schools Development Center. Calling in again.

05:15:28.680 --> 05:15:34.280
Hi, members of the board. I wasn't anticipating calling in on this until I heard a previous

05:15:34.280 --> 05:15:42.600
caller suggest that appeals were, we just keep seeing appeals that from schools that just refuse

05:15:42.600 --> 05:15:49.880
to accept perfectly reasonable decisions from the local authorities. This comment is not about

05:15:49.880 --> 05:15:57.240
LUSD, LACO, and in this case, it is about this general process here about when we hear appeals.

05:15:57.240 --> 05:16:03.720
I just want to attest, I know an extraordinary amount about the use of data, certainly in these

05:16:03.720 --> 05:16:09.400
types of decisions and want to say that right now we have a great deal of work to do on

05:16:09.400 --> 05:16:16.120
understanding these incredibly complex and layered decisions and not always the greatest data.

05:16:16.680 --> 05:16:24.120
So we appreciate collaboration with some of these authorizers and into getting some shared

05:16:24.120 --> 05:16:30.280
understandings and hopefully minimizing some of these issues. We embrace that work, but we think

05:16:30.280 --> 05:16:38.040
we are, that caller we think is really misinformed about how appeals can come about. Thank you.

05:16:38.680 --> 05:16:43.480
Thank you. Your time is up. And that concludes public comment for item nine.

05:16:43.480 --> 05:16:48.440
Okay, thank you very much. We'll now open for board discussion.

05:16:49.880 --> 05:16:55.880
Are there comments or questions from members of the board? We've heard from our two liaisons.

05:16:59.000 --> 05:17:04.920
We can either probe further if there are questions or take a motion.

05:17:09.000 --> 05:17:10.280
Vice President Glover Woods.

05:17:11.240 --> 05:17:19.800
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond. I move that we hear the appeal that has been presented before

05:17:19.800 --> 05:17:33.160
us. Okay, all in favor say aye. Aye. All right, any nay? One. All right, the motion passes.

05:17:33.880 --> 05:17:41.000
And we'll at this point go on to the actual public hearing.

05:17:47.000 --> 05:17:53.960
So item 10 is a public hearing regarding the appeal of the denial of the petition for the

05:17:53.960 --> 05:18:00.440
establishment of the classroom-based charter school and the decision to affirm or reverse

05:18:00.440 --> 05:18:05.400
the Los Angeles Unified School Districts and Los Angeles County Board of Education's determinations

05:18:05.400 --> 05:18:13.480
of the VISTA Legacy Global Academy petition. And as you know, the item will be presented by

05:18:13.480 --> 05:18:20.520
Nancy Kim Portillo of the CDE. The CDE recommends that the state board affirm the determinations of

05:18:20.520 --> 05:18:28.520
the LA USD and the LA County Board of Education. And I will pass the ball to you, Nancy. Please begin.

05:18:30.840 --> 05:18:35.480
Good afternoon, Board President Darling-Hammond, Chief Deputy Nicely, and members of the board.

05:18:35.480 --> 05:18:39.480
My name is Nancy Kim Portillo and I will be presenting on item 10, review of the

05:18:39.480 --> 05:18:46.520
appeal and decision to affirm or reverse denial of the VISTA Legacy Global Academy petition.

05:18:50.600 --> 05:18:56.600
VISTA Legacy Global Academy, VISTA legacy or petitioner, submitted an establishment charter

05:18:56.600 --> 05:19:02.760
petition to the Los Angeles Unified School District, LA USD or district, and the Los Angeles County

05:19:02.760 --> 05:19:11.880
Board of Education, LACBO or county pursuant to California Ed Code, sections 47605A and 47605K1AI

05:19:16.600 --> 05:19:24.520
respectively. The district and county denied the petition. VISTA Legacy appealed its denial to the

05:19:24.520 --> 05:19:44.760
California State Board of Education, pursuant to Ed Code section 47605K2E, which was clarified by

05:19:44.760 --> 05:19:57.000
Senate Bill 114, Chapter 48, Statutes of 2023, the SBE May. Affirm the determination of the

05:19:57.000 --> 05:20:03.240
governing board of the school district or the county board of education or both of those

05:20:03.240 --> 05:20:11.400
determinations or reverse only upon a determination that there was an abuse of discretion by each of

05:20:11.400 --> 05:20:18.360
the governing board of the school district and the county board of education. These clarifications

05:20:18.360 --> 05:20:26.920
are consistent with and affirm the interpretation by the CDE as presented in prior charter appeal

05:20:26.920 --> 05:20:35.080
items, that the SBE must find an abuse of discretion at both the district and county levels

05:20:35.160 --> 05:20:44.040
to deny a petition. If the SBE does not take action to affirm or reverse the determinations

05:20:44.040 --> 05:20:49.560
of the governing board of the school district and the county board of education to deny the

05:20:49.560 --> 05:21:03.560
charter petition will stand. SB 114 also clarified the SBE's standard of review, again consistent

05:21:03.560 --> 05:21:11.720
with the CDE's interpretation as presented in prior charter appeal items. Abuse of discretion

05:21:11.720 --> 05:21:17.640
is the most deferential standard of review under which the state board must give deference to the

05:21:17.640 --> 05:21:22.680
decisions of the governing board of the school district and the county board of education to

05:21:22.680 --> 05:21:31.000
deny the petition. The SBE's review is limited to a determination of whether the district governing

05:21:31.000 --> 05:21:38.120
boards or county board's decision to deny the charter petition was arbitrary, capricious,

05:21:38.120 --> 05:21:45.800
entirely lacking in evidentiary support, unlawful or procedurally unfair. California School Boards

05:21:45.800 --> 05:21:56.920
Association versus State Board of Education 2010-186, Cal App 4, 1298-1313-1314. If even one

05:21:56.920 --> 05:22:03.640
basis for denial is supported by evidence in the record, the determination to deny should be affirmed.

05:22:07.160 --> 05:22:13.880
Recommendation. The California Department of Education recommends that the SBE

05:22:13.880 --> 05:22:21.720
affirm the determinations of the LAUSD and the LACBO to deny the petition to establish

05:22:21.720 --> 05:22:33.800
VLGA pursuant to Ed Code section 47605K2E. This is based on its analysis of the documentary record

05:22:33.800 --> 05:22:40.040
the CDE has determined that both the district and the county made written factual findings for

05:22:40.040 --> 05:22:46.440
denial of the VISTA legacy petition that are supported by evidence in the record in accordance

05:22:46.440 --> 05:22:51.000
with Ed Code section 47605C.

05:22:55.640 --> 05:23:01.560
Findings for denial by the district. The district cited the following findings in its denial of

05:23:01.560 --> 05:23:08.520
the VISTA legacy petition. Petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement

05:23:08.520 --> 05:23:18.200
the program set forth in the petition. Ed Code section 47605C2. The petition does not contain

05:23:18.200 --> 05:23:26.440
reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all of the required elements. Ed Code section 47605C5.

05:23:27.640 --> 05:23:32.840
The charter school is demonstrably unlikely to serve the interests of the entire community in

05:23:32.840 --> 05:23:39.880
which the school is proposing to locate. Ed Code section 47605C7.

05:23:42.680 --> 05:23:48.760
Findings for denial by the county. The county cited the following findings in its denial of

05:23:48.760 --> 05:23:54.920
the VISTA legacy petition. Petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement

05:23:54.920 --> 05:24:04.360
the program set forth in the petition. Ed Code section 47605C2. The petition does not contain

05:24:04.360 --> 05:24:13.720
reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all of the required elements. Education Code section 47605C5.

05:24:14.760 --> 05:24:19.720
The charter school is demonstrably unlikely to serve the interests of the entire community

05:24:19.800 --> 05:24:26.840
in which the school is proposing to locate. Education Code section 47605C7.

05:24:31.640 --> 05:24:34.440
Next, VISTA legacy global academies written submission.

05:24:36.680 --> 05:24:42.280
Petitioners allegations against the district. The petitioner alleges the following abusive

05:24:42.280 --> 05:24:48.200
discretion by the district. The factual findings adopted by the district board are not supported

05:24:48.200 --> 05:24:55.640
by substantial evidence in light of the entire record. The district abused its discretion by

05:24:55.640 --> 05:25:01.800
acting unlawfully and in a procedurally unfair manner by using an unlawfully burdensome

05:25:01.800 --> 05:25:07.800
definition of community impact and by imposing requirements found nowhere in the charter school's

05:25:07.800 --> 05:25:16.360
act. Petitioners allegations against the county. The petitioner alleges the following abusive

05:25:16.360 --> 05:25:23.800
discretion by the county. Statutory finding C2 was arbitrary and capricious in that the factual

05:25:23.800 --> 05:25:29.720
findings are not supported by evidence in the record. The county board acted in an arbitrary

05:25:29.720 --> 05:25:37.000
manner without evidentiary support when it adopted statutory findings, C5. The county

05:25:37.000 --> 05:25:43.000
board acted unlawfully when it failed to provide a de novo review and relied on undue deference

05:25:43.000 --> 05:25:52.200
to LAUSD in adopting statutory findings, C7. LACBO's hearing was procedurally infirm and unfair.

05:25:56.120 --> 05:25:59.240
District and county oppositions to petitioners appeal.

05:26:02.520 --> 05:26:12.680
Written opposition. Education Code section 47605K2C states the following. Within 30 days of receipt

05:26:12.680 --> 05:26:17.640
of the appeal submitted to the state board, the governing board of the school district or county

05:26:17.640 --> 05:26:23.720
board of education may submit a written opposition to the state board detailing with specific

05:26:23.720 --> 05:26:29.080
citations to the documentary record how the governing board of the school district or the

05:26:29.080 --> 05:26:35.080
county board of education did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition. Both the

05:26:35.080 --> 05:26:39.880
district and the county submitted written oppositions pursuant to the aforementioned section.

05:26:43.400 --> 05:26:49.400
District opposition. In its written opposition to VISTA legacy's appeal, the district states,

05:26:50.120 --> 05:26:56.600
petitioner failed to demonstrate LAUSD abused its discretion. The LAUSD board denied the petition

05:26:56.600 --> 05:27:03.000
consistent with the charter schools act. Petitioner failed to adequately cite to the documentary

05:27:03.000 --> 05:27:10.680
record. The SBE must affirm the LAUSD board's decision and deny the petition regardless of

05:27:10.680 --> 05:27:14.040
whether it affirms or denies the county board's decision.

05:27:17.320 --> 05:27:24.600
County opposition. In its written opposition to VISTA legacy's appeal, the county states,

05:27:24.600 --> 05:27:30.120
LACBO's finding that VISTA was unlikely to successfully implement its program was based

05:27:30.120 --> 05:27:35.320
on its review of the evidence and does not constitute an abuse of discretion.

05:27:35.720 --> 05:27:40.920
LACBO's finding that the petition did not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of required

05:27:40.920 --> 05:27:47.480
elements was based on its review and analysis of petition and did not constitute an abuse of

05:27:47.480 --> 05:27:54.360
discretion. VISTA's appeal fails to demonstrate any abuse of discretion in LACBO's findings

05:27:54.360 --> 05:28:01.720
regarding community impact. VISTA's position that LACBO was unable to act on a motion that had been

05:28:01.720 --> 05:28:07.080
moved and seconded without first voting on a conflicting motion is entirely without legal

05:28:07.080 --> 05:28:16.680
support and would lead to absurd results. California Department of Education's review.

05:28:19.560 --> 05:28:25.880
District and county findings. After reviewing the documentary record and supporting documentation

05:28:26.600 --> 05:28:32.600
and supporting documentation submitted by the parties to this appeal, the CDE has determined

05:28:33.640 --> 05:28:39.320
both the district and the county made written factual findings in accordance with Ed code

05:28:39.320 --> 05:28:47.320
section 47605C and both the districts and the county's findings are supported by evidence in

05:28:47.320 --> 05:28:58.520
the record. District and county findings examples of evidence. The district's finding that the

05:28:58.520 --> 05:29:04.680
petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition

05:29:04.680 --> 05:29:12.360
is supported by specific facts including but not limited to the following. Details of the proposed

05:29:12.360 --> 05:29:18.520
English language development program. Factual emissions pertaining to the petitioners existing

05:29:18.520 --> 05:29:24.040
charter schools and governance structure and the performance and operational demands of the

05:29:24.040 --> 05:29:30.680
petitioners existing charter schools. The county's finding that the charter school is demonstrably

05:29:30.680 --> 05:29:35.800
unlikely to serve the interest of the entire community in which the school is proposing to

05:29:35.800 --> 05:29:43.800
locate is supported by specific facts including but not limited to enrollment data of nearby

05:29:43.800 --> 05:29:48.520
district and charter schools. Programs available at schools in the community.

05:29:52.040 --> 05:29:58.440
District and county findings conclusion. While the petitioner's appeal challenged the conclusions

05:29:58.440 --> 05:30:05.480
made by the district and the county, the petitioner has not refuted the evidence relied on by the

05:30:05.480 --> 05:30:13.960
district or the county in their respective findings for denial. The petitioner instead argues for the

05:30:13.960 --> 05:30:20.760
state board of education to exercise its independent judgment in reviewing the evidence in the record

05:30:20.760 --> 05:30:30.520
which is not permitted under the abuse of discretion review standard. Review of procedural allegations.

05:30:31.480 --> 05:30:36.680
The petitioner alleges the district's requirement that petitioners submit a community impact

05:30:36.680 --> 05:30:43.800
assessment with their petition constitutes an abuse of discretion. Vista legacy's written submission

05:30:43.800 --> 05:30:49.480
has not shown how the district requirement of a community impact assessment constitutes an abuse

05:30:49.480 --> 05:30:56.600
of discretion. The petitioner also alleges the county abused its discretion in denying a board

05:30:56.600 --> 05:31:01.560
member's request to amend the motion to deny and approve the Vista legacy charter.

05:31:02.680 --> 05:31:09.560
The transcript and recording of the meeting in question show that county proceeded

05:31:10.520 --> 05:31:17.400
in accordance with its bylaws and standard open meeting procedures. A comprehensive review of

05:31:17.400 --> 05:31:22.520
the Vista legacy appeal including the districts and the county's written oppositions and the

05:31:22.520 --> 05:31:27.800
districts and the county findings regarding the petition is provided as attachment one.

05:31:31.480 --> 05:31:33.320
Conclusion and recommendation.

05:31:36.840 --> 05:31:43.800
The CDE recommends that the SBE affirm both the district and the county's determinations

05:31:43.800 --> 05:31:50.760
to deny the Vista legacy petition. Based on its analysis of the documentary record,

05:31:50.760 --> 05:31:56.360
the CDE has determined that both the district and the county made written factual findings for

05:31:56.360 --> 05:32:02.760
denial of the Vista legacy petition that are supported by evidence in accordance with education

05:32:02.760 --> 05:32:16.120
code section 47605C. Under education code section 476052E, the lack of an abuse of discretion by

05:32:16.120 --> 05:32:21.480
either the district or the county means that there is no basis to support a recommendation

05:32:21.480 --> 05:32:28.040
of reversal of the districts and county's determinations to deny the Vista legacy petition.

05:32:33.880 --> 05:32:34.360
Thank you.

05:32:34.360 --> 05:32:47.000
Thank you very much. At this point, I will now open the public hearing at 3.30 p.m.

05:32:47.800 --> 05:32:52.600
We will hear first from the petitioners. They will have 10 minutes to make their presentation.

05:32:53.240 --> 05:32:57.160
We will then hear from the district and the county office of education.

05:32:57.160 --> 05:33:00.920
They will have a combined 10 minutes to make their presentation.

05:33:01.640 --> 05:33:06.040
After the presentations, we will open up the phone line for public comment from individuals

05:33:06.040 --> 05:33:13.720
who are not part of either presentation. So we are now ready for the petitioners to begin.

05:33:22.600 --> 05:33:27.320
Good afternoon, board. Quick procedural question, President Darningham. The CDE

05:33:27.320 --> 05:33:30.760
presentation was 14 minutes. Do we not get 14 minutes as well?

05:33:31.320 --> 05:33:33.080
You get 10 minutes. Thank you.

05:33:34.360 --> 05:33:41.960
We're ready to begin. I'm John Lemmo, and I will be presenting first. First, I need to clarify

05:33:41.960 --> 05:33:47.880
that SB 114 was not a clarification to law. It was a change in law. The Office of Legislative

05:33:47.880 --> 05:33:52.280
Council, which advises the legislature on such things, said it was a change in law.

05:33:53.240 --> 05:33:58.600
When we submitted this petition, the law was that you would find an abuse of discretion at

05:33:58.600 --> 05:34:05.160
the district or the county or both. It has now been changed to you have to find an abuse of

05:34:05.160 --> 05:34:11.320
discretion at both the district and county. We ask that you follow your precedent in prior examples

05:34:11.320 --> 05:34:15.720
in the Evangelados case, which is to stick with the procedure as it was when we filed.

05:34:15.720 --> 05:34:21.560
But in any event, we're going to cover abuses of discretion at both the county and district level.

05:34:22.520 --> 05:34:28.120
First of all, the statutory presumption here is that charters shall be encouraged. The

05:34:28.120 --> 05:34:33.240
legislative intent, even after AB 1505, is that the charters are supposed to provide vigorous

05:34:33.240 --> 05:34:38.360
competition within the public school system. Specific findings are required by districts and

05:34:38.360 --> 05:34:44.840
counties if they're going to deny. District or county shall not deny unless it makes factual

05:34:44.840 --> 05:34:49.560
findings supported by facts in the record, not just conclusions. They can't just say the moon

05:34:49.560 --> 05:34:54.440
is made of green cheese and have us all believe that. There has to be facts. You're still the

05:34:54.440 --> 05:34:59.080
backstop to prevent abuse and ensure that districts and counties fulfill their obligations, and that's

05:34:59.080 --> 05:35:04.440
all we want here. You review for abuse of discretion and you may reverse if you find that there's an

05:35:04.440 --> 05:35:11.560
abuse. CDE has articulated what abuse of discretion means, and it's very broad. Arbitrary, capricious,

05:35:11.560 --> 05:35:17.480
entirely lacking in support, unlawful, or procedurally unfair. But bare conclusions don't

05:35:17.480 --> 05:35:23.320
count. You look at the documentary record. You need to harmonize that standard with the

05:35:23.320 --> 05:35:29.000
encouragement of charter schools and vigorous competition. We are not asking the board here

05:35:29.000 --> 05:35:33.880
to exercise this independent judgment. I don't know why the staff concluded that. You're looking

05:35:33.880 --> 05:35:38.840
for an abuse of discretion. Here there are multiple abuses. We can't cover all of them in our 10

05:35:38.840 --> 05:35:43.160
minutes, unfortunately. So I'm going to focus on the most obvious one that they didn't even

05:35:43.160 --> 05:35:51.160
mention in the staff report. Failure to meet the standard under C7. C7 requires that the district

05:35:51.160 --> 05:35:56.920
board make findings that detail, I quoted it for you here, details specific facts and circumstances

05:35:56.920 --> 05:36:03.240
that analyze and consider the extent that the charter would substantially undermine existing

05:36:03.240 --> 05:36:09.160
district services or programs. Not affect, not even adversely affect, but substantially undermine.

05:36:09.160 --> 05:36:16.200
That means more than just some impact. It means cause to collapse, subvert, destroy in a large

05:36:16.200 --> 05:36:21.320
considerable manner. Those are just dictionary definitions. Every charter school approval is

05:36:21.320 --> 05:36:26.920
going to have some impact to some degree on a district. This is about substantially undermined.

05:36:26.920 --> 05:36:32.840
It's about the magnitude. There's no facts or analysis whatsoever in the record discussing

05:36:32.840 --> 05:36:40.360
substantially undermined. The district's evidence, the facts say they will lose 26 students to Vista

05:36:40.360 --> 05:36:46.680
in year one and 105 at full enrollment. That's in the record, your document three at 1311.

05:36:47.320 --> 05:36:53.480
26 one hundredths of one percent of enrollment is not substantially undermining. The loss of

05:36:53.480 --> 05:36:59.560
8.9 million dollars spread over five years is less than one ten thousandth or one one hundredth of one

05:36:59.560 --> 05:37:07.080
percent, not undermining in any way, barely negligible effect. CDE staff sort of conflates

05:37:07.080 --> 05:37:14.360
these things by saying undermine slash impact. That's on page 12 of the staff report. That's

05:37:14.360 --> 05:37:19.960
missing the point. The entire district's documentary record, the entire attachment three

05:37:19.960 --> 05:37:25.320
do a word search. It doesn't even mention substantially undermined, not even mentioned,

05:37:25.320 --> 05:37:30.920
even though we explained it. They cite the evidence of some impact, we concede that,

05:37:30.920 --> 05:37:38.680
but not substantially undermining. I mentioned the conflating of the standard. There's no duplication

05:37:38.680 --> 05:37:45.480
here of any existing LUSD program or school. They offer programs that are similar or the same at

05:37:45.480 --> 05:37:51.160
different programs, but no single school offers what Vista offers. A student would have to

05:37:51.160 --> 05:37:57.400
simultaneously enroll at at least three LUSD schools to enjoy all the offerings of this school.

05:37:57.960 --> 05:38:03.080
The county, no specific facts or analysis whatsoever demonstrating substantially undermining.

05:38:03.080 --> 05:38:08.600
It relies completely on the district staff report. In fact, the term substantially undermined

05:38:08.600 --> 05:38:13.320
does not appear anywhere in the county's written opposition to this appeal. That's the attachment

05:38:13.320 --> 05:38:20.280
seven that's in your report. They merely conclude without evidence that this school might cause

05:38:20.280 --> 05:38:25.880
the closure of LUSD schools. That's a bare conclusion without evidence. The district says

05:38:25.880 --> 05:38:33.400
they will lose 26 to 105 students to the district out of its 400,000 students. For both the district

05:38:33.400 --> 05:38:37.560
and the county, the evidence does not support a finding that this school is demonstrably unlikely

05:38:37.560 --> 05:38:43.080
to successfully implement the program and the petition. To the contrary, the evidence supports

05:38:43.080 --> 05:38:47.560
the conclusion that school is likely to be successful. It's a highly successful operator.

05:38:47.640 --> 05:38:54.520
I'm going to let Dr. Wilson explain that further. I have here findings that you can make that are

05:38:54.520 --> 05:38:59.960
easy, easy swings to find abusives of discretion here and reverse the charter denial.

05:39:07.560 --> 05:39:12.200
Good afternoon, honorable board. I'm Dr. Don Wilson, a superintendent for Vista Charter Public

05:39:12.280 --> 05:39:18.760
Schools. Today, LUSD and LACOR, they're going to try to make a case that we are demonstrably

05:39:18.760 --> 05:39:23.640
unlikely to be successful with our new high school. In their effort to prove their point,

05:39:23.640 --> 05:39:28.920
you might hear them say that our budget projections provided in the petition are unsound. Yet,

05:39:28.920 --> 05:39:34.200
we have 14 years of charter experience working with budgets over six different schools.

05:39:34.920 --> 05:39:40.760
We have 14 years, I'm sorry, we have 10 million dollars in reserve and 13 years of receiving

05:39:40.760 --> 05:39:47.240
the highest scores in our oversight visits with both LUSD and with OCDE. We have an impressive

05:39:47.240 --> 05:39:52.360
bond rating that has helped us buy our two facilities and we are in the black year after

05:39:52.360 --> 05:39:58.280
year. We clearly understand how to manage a successful budget and are demonstrably likely

05:39:58.280 --> 05:40:04.280
to continue to do so. Today, you might hear LUSD try to paint our academic success in a negative

05:40:04.280 --> 05:40:10.280
light in comparison to the state. 98 percent of our students are low income and their options are

05:40:10.280 --> 05:40:15.880
not across the state and they're not even across Los Angeles, but they're within small city blocks

05:40:15.880 --> 05:40:21.400
of where they live. When you look at our scores by neighboring schools with similar demographics,

05:40:21.400 --> 05:40:27.080
the numbers tell a different story and when you compare our academic growth with the state growth,

05:40:27.080 --> 05:40:32.760
regardless of demographics, it is impressive. We are outperforming the schools our students would

05:40:32.760 --> 05:40:38.600
otherwise attend and in many cases by double digits. Spurgeon is literally across the street

05:40:38.600 --> 05:40:45.000
from VISTA heritage and we outscored them by over 20 percentage points in ELA and three times more

05:40:45.000 --> 05:40:51.480
in math and when comparing VISTA with the state, our middle schools far outpace the state's growth

05:40:51.480 --> 05:40:58.760
of under two percent and we've seen growth of 11 percent in ELA and 10 growth in math just in one

05:40:58.760 --> 05:41:05.640
year. Our students are demonstrably likely to continue to do so when they enter into our high

05:41:05.640 --> 05:41:11.800
school. You may hear from our you may hear today that our partnership with UC Irvine is suspect.

05:41:11.800 --> 05:41:19.000
The reality is that we have an MOU from 2021 and two years of pacing plans co-developed with the UCI

05:41:19.000 --> 05:41:24.360
science project for the first ever climate change leadership pathway in the state of California.

05:41:25.000 --> 05:41:30.600
Further, our dual enrollment program has had an astounding success with over 100 students

05:41:30.600 --> 05:41:37.320
successfully completing a college course just last year. We are demonstrably likely to implement

05:41:37.320 --> 05:41:43.160
the same program in Los Angeles. You might hear today that we have duplicative programs already

05:41:43.160 --> 05:41:49.240
at LDSD schools. Our schools have a highly integrated social emotional program, innovative

05:41:49.240 --> 05:41:55.880
mastery approach, integrated STEAM curriculum, dual enrollment, career pathways, leading to work

05:41:55.880 --> 05:42:01.000
certificates and all on the foundation of our partnership with the international study school

05:42:01.000 --> 05:42:06.520
network which provides our students with a proven global curriculum and an opportunity to take

05:42:06.520 --> 05:42:13.800
action. While LAUSD might provide some of those programs at some other schools, not one LAUSD

05:42:13.800 --> 05:42:19.400
school provides all of our programs at one site. A student would have to travel over 25 miles and

05:42:19.400 --> 05:42:25.640
attend multiple schools which is illegal to get to the equivalent of our program. We stand firm

05:42:25.640 --> 05:42:33.000
in our belief that both LAUSD and LACO abused their discretion. VISTA legacy will not substantially

05:42:33.000 --> 05:42:40.280
undermine any LAUSD program, not even close. However, if you're inclined to defer to the district

05:42:40.280 --> 05:42:45.400
then I would kindly ask that you defer to the 12 years of exemplary oversight visits that they've

05:42:45.400 --> 05:42:51.080
given us, that you would defer to our six successful schools and repeated renewals each year

05:42:51.080 --> 05:42:56.520
which all clearly show that we're not only demonstrably likely to be successful but we're

05:42:56.520 --> 05:43:02.120
absolutely likely to continue to bless the lives of our students and families who call this to home

05:43:02.120 --> 05:43:07.880
and we hope to do so all the way through graduation. I thank you for your time and

05:43:07.880 --> 05:43:10.280
thank you for your support in advance of the vote.

05:43:10.280 --> 05:43:29.480
And we're now ready for the LAUSD and county office representatives. Thank you.

05:43:40.600 --> 05:43:48.600
And as noted you have 10 minutes between you. Thank you. Good afternoon board president,

05:43:48.600 --> 05:43:53.240
Darlene Hammond, board members, a special congratulations to our new student board member

05:43:53.240 --> 05:43:57.320
and all staff. My name is Jose Cole Gutierrez, director of the charter schools division

05:43:57.320 --> 05:44:02.120
for Los Angeles Unified School District. I'm joined by general counsel team member Richard

05:44:02.120 --> 05:44:06.680
Gonzalez and additional staff and on behalf of our board and superintendent we thank you for

05:44:06.680 --> 05:44:12.600
your time and consideration today. As we review these slides, a question before the state board

05:44:12.600 --> 05:44:18.600
of education is whether or not the LAUSD board of education abused its discretion when it denied

05:44:18.600 --> 05:44:26.120
the VISTA legacy petition. As established in the documentary record as well as a CD staff report

05:44:26.120 --> 05:44:33.080
eloquently presented today by Dr. Kim Portillo, we respectfully note in our answer is no and we

05:44:33.080 --> 05:44:43.560
would ask the SBE to agree with that. LA Unified properly denied the VISTA legacy global petition.

05:44:44.440 --> 05:44:48.840
I won't repeat the citations that Dr. Kim Portillo noted but they're here on the slides.

05:44:50.120 --> 05:44:57.560
I will note however a few responses very briefly to some of the representations made by the

05:44:57.560 --> 05:45:04.280
petitioners. First, by introducing renewal standards is different than a new petition

05:45:04.280 --> 05:45:09.480
standard. Their oversight scores in recent years have included fours are accomplished as well as

05:45:09.480 --> 05:45:18.040
twos developing ones unsatisfactory. Secondly, the petition was not addressed in in terms of

05:45:18.040 --> 05:45:23.240
the reasonable comprehensiveness in response to the district's findings. That alone presents a

05:45:23.240 --> 05:45:29.240
problem in terms of the abuse of discretion standard. We believe that SBE's adoption of

05:45:29.240 --> 05:45:33.960
the staff recommendation would be consistent with that highest level of deference to the

05:45:33.960 --> 05:45:42.920
local authority in accordance with the law. There is ample evidence and supporting documentation

05:45:42.920 --> 05:45:49.720
in the findings as affirmed by CDE staff. The petitioner failed to adequately and specifically

05:45:49.720 --> 05:45:55.080
cite to the documentary record to explain how the LA Unified board abused its discretion which

05:45:55.080 --> 05:46:02.840
is required by law. And again, the appeal fails entirely to acknowledge the LA USD's board third

05:46:02.840 --> 05:46:08.920
basis for denial that the petition was not reasonably comprehensive. This is tantamount

05:46:08.920 --> 05:46:14.280
to a waiver of the appeal on this ground for denial. The law does not specify you to have

05:46:14.280 --> 05:46:21.000
X number. It's one of those could be sufficient. That alone is not addressed and would disqualify

05:46:21.000 --> 05:46:26.280
in our view the agreement the argument that the petitioners make that LA Unified abused its

05:46:26.280 --> 05:46:34.360
discretion. Therefore, we conclude respectfully that the board properly denied the petition in

05:46:34.360 --> 05:46:39.800
accordance with education code. It is established in the documentary record and discussed in our

05:46:39.800 --> 05:46:48.280
written opposition and in staff's appeal review. We respectfully request the state board to uphold

05:46:48.280 --> 05:46:51.400
and adopt staff's recommendation. I'll turn it over to the county.

05:46:51.400 --> 05:47:10.440
Good afternoon, members of the state board of education. My name is Patrick Saldana. I'm the

05:47:10.440 --> 05:47:15.080
deputy general counsel for the Los Angeles County Office of Education and I'm accompanied by Duncan

05:47:15.080 --> 05:47:19.560
McCullough from our charter schools office. I'm here to present the Los Angeles County Board of

05:47:19.560 --> 05:47:26.840
Education's opposition to the appeal of Vista Legacy Global Academy. We respectfully request

05:47:26.840 --> 05:47:32.440
that the state board adopt CDE staff report and deny Vista's appeal in this matter. The CDE staff

05:47:32.440 --> 05:47:37.480
report provides a comprehensive analysis of the appeal and administrative record and correctly

05:47:37.480 --> 05:47:41.480
finds that no abuse of discretion occurred at either the district or county board level.

05:47:42.360 --> 05:47:47.000
Staff correctly identified that the county board's findings are supported by evidence in the record

05:47:47.640 --> 05:47:50.600
and the county board's meeting was conducted in accordance with its bylaws.

05:47:51.640 --> 05:47:56.360
It is clear that petitioners appeal seeks to direct the SBE to reevaluate the evidence and

05:47:56.360 --> 05:48:00.840
reach a different conclusion from the county boards which is not permissible under the abuse

05:48:00.840 --> 05:48:05.800
of discretion standard. CDE staff correctly identified this issue in their report.

05:48:09.400 --> 05:48:13.800
The CDE staff report provides an excellent explanation of the abuse of discretion standard

05:48:13.800 --> 05:48:19.080
which applies to charter appeals. This is a highly deferential standard and deference must

05:48:19.080 --> 05:48:24.120
be given to the decisions of the LAUSD governing board and Los Angeles County Board of Education

05:48:24.120 --> 05:48:29.400
to deny the petition. Review is limited to determining whether the decision to deny the

05:48:29.400 --> 05:48:34.680
charter was arbitrary, capricious, entirely lacking in evidentiary support, unlawful,

05:48:35.320 --> 05:48:40.920
or procedurally unfair. Most notably in determining whether an abuse of discretion occurred,

05:48:40.920 --> 05:48:45.240
the SBE may not exercise its independent judgment in reviewing the evidence in the record.

05:48:46.040 --> 05:48:49.560
If reasonable minds may disagree as to the wisdom of the county board's action,

05:48:49.560 --> 05:48:51.400
its determination must be upheld.

05:48:54.520 --> 05:48:59.880
VISTA has failed to show an abuse of discretion by LACBO. Staff conducted a review of VISTA's

05:48:59.880 --> 05:49:05.880
petition and information provided by VISTA. Based on that review and analysis and as explained in

05:49:05.880 --> 05:49:10.600
LACBO's opposition to this appeal, the county board of education properly denied VISTA's charter.

05:49:11.640 --> 05:49:16.120
VISTA now appeals that decision based in large part upon an absurd argument that the county

05:49:16.120 --> 05:49:20.280
board abused its discretion by relying upon data and information provided by VISTA.

05:49:21.160 --> 05:49:25.640
For example, VISTA applied a three-mile radius community definition in its charter petition

05:49:25.640 --> 05:49:30.680
when it submitted its appeal to LACBO. VISTA never suggested that a different community should be

05:49:30.680 --> 05:49:35.240
considered and did not propose any alternative analysis in any of the materials it submitted

05:49:35.320 --> 05:49:41.560
to LACBO. So the petition was analyzed using VISTA's own data. With no legal support for

05:49:41.560 --> 05:49:45.320
this position and citing a case that has nothing to do with the definition of community,

05:49:45.960 --> 05:49:50.600
VISTA now contends that analyzing the petition based upon VISTA's own community definition and

05:49:50.600 --> 05:49:55.960
data constituted an abuse of discretion. This position is without legal support.

05:49:57.320 --> 05:50:01.240
It is plainly apparent from the appeal that VISTA seeks to have the state board apply its

05:50:01.240 --> 05:50:05.320
independent judgment in the hope that a different outcome will be reached. However,

05:50:05.320 --> 05:50:08.760
as the Superior Court of Sacramento County stated in the Maya Commons Charter case,

05:50:08.760 --> 05:50:13.000
the state board has no authority to do so. Under an abuse of discretion review,

05:50:13.000 --> 05:50:16.440
even if the state board feels a reasonable person could potentially reach a different

05:50:16.440 --> 05:50:21.560
conclusion based upon the evidence, SBE must give deference to LACBO and uphold its decision

05:50:21.560 --> 05:50:25.400
unless they're persuaded that no reasonable person could reach the decision LACBO reached

05:50:25.400 --> 05:50:31.240
in this matter. VISTA has failed to meet that standard. The record demonstrably disproves

05:50:31.240 --> 05:50:35.880
VISTA's allegations. This is a charter organization that has failed to perform basic functions

05:50:36.520 --> 05:50:41.160
such as submitting dashboard data to CDE and takes issue with being analyzed upon its own

05:50:41.160 --> 05:50:47.560
representations and data. VISTA also chose to wait until 4.50 p.m. the day before the LACBO meeting

05:50:47.560 --> 05:50:52.440
to submit a 30-page response to the staff report and now seeks to invent a requirement that each

05:50:52.440 --> 05:50:57.640
and every point in its 11th hour optional response had to be specifically rebutted by the board

05:50:57.640 --> 05:51:01.880
on the following day. There is no such requirement under the Charter Schools Act.

05:51:04.680 --> 05:51:09.000
Finally, VISTA's appeal demonstrates a lack of understanding of parliamentary procedure.

05:51:09.000 --> 05:51:11.880
The County Board of Education has adopted Robert's Rules of Order.

05:51:12.760 --> 05:51:17.960
Under Robert's Rules, motions to amend a motion which has been moved and seconded may be considered,

05:51:17.960 --> 05:51:23.160
but a motion to amend cannot be adverse to the pending motion. An attempt to bring an adverse

05:51:23.160 --> 05:51:27.400
motion in the guise of a motion to amend is improper and out of order and not permitted to

05:51:27.400 --> 05:51:32.600
be acted upon. In this case, the record shows that a motion to deny VISTA's charter had been

05:51:32.600 --> 05:51:37.480
moved and seconded. Vice President Chan subsequently indicated that she would like to move to amend

05:51:37.480 --> 05:51:43.480
the motion to approve the charter. Dr. Chan's motion was unquestionably adverse to the pending

05:51:43.480 --> 05:51:49.720
motion. Improper and out of order. The board proceeded properly by holding a vote on the motion

05:51:49.720 --> 05:51:54.760
to deny the charter which was then adopted by the County Board of Education. This discontention on

05:51:54.760 --> 05:51:58.920
this point is entirely without legal support and does not constitute an abuse of discretion.

05:51:59.800 --> 05:52:04.280
We respectfully request that this appeal be denied. LACO staff is available for questions on this

05:52:04.280 --> 05:52:17.720
matter. Thank you. Thank you very much. At this point, we will open the phone line for the public

05:52:17.720 --> 05:52:46.520
comment. Are there any public commenters in the room? Yes, we have five signed up. Nicholas

05:52:46.520 --> 05:52:52.920
Watson, Colin Felch, Karen Amaya, Angela Stiegel, and Carlos Machado, please line up.

05:53:01.240 --> 05:53:06.120
And we can start whenever you're ready. Please give your name and affiliation for the record.

05:53:06.680 --> 05:53:09.720
Good afternoon, members of the board. My name is Nicholas Watson. I'm speaking on behalf of

05:53:09.720 --> 05:53:15.720
the California Charter Schools Association. CCSA supports VISTA legacy and we encourage the board

05:53:15.720 --> 05:53:20.120
to approve this charter petition. The Charter Schools Act states that the establishment of

05:53:20.120 --> 05:53:25.720
new charter schools should be encouraged. The act creates presumption of approval unless the

05:53:25.720 --> 05:53:32.440
district or county adopts written factual findings specific to the petition. Neither LAUSD or LACO

05:53:32.440 --> 05:53:37.880
made those findings. VISTA is a successful charter school operator that operates six schools,

05:53:38.600 --> 05:53:43.240
including two schools in LAUSD. The district and county carry the burden of demonstrating

05:53:43.240 --> 05:53:48.760
that VISTA legacy is demonstrably unlikely to succeed where the other VISTA schools have

05:53:48.760 --> 05:53:53.320
been very successful. The district and the county also failed to adopt written findings supporting

05:53:53.320 --> 05:53:58.040
their conclusion that VISTA legacy would substantially undermine existing services of the

05:53:58.040 --> 05:54:04.520
district. LAUSD has more than 400,000 students enrolled and a 19 billion dollar budget. They

05:54:04.520 --> 05:54:08.280
did not make a credible case that one new charter school could undermine the district.

05:54:09.640 --> 05:54:12.840
We're not asking the state board to substitute its judgment for the judgment of the district

05:54:12.840 --> 05:54:18.360
and county. We're only asking you to determine that the district and county abuse their discretion.

05:54:18.920 --> 05:54:26.520
The state level appeal under 1505 has no value if the SBE affirms wrongful denials of petitions.

05:54:26.520 --> 05:54:27.480
Thank you. Thank you.

05:54:31.240 --> 05:54:35.000
Good afternoon, Dr. Colin Felch, Deputy Superintendent, VISTA Charter Public Schools.

05:54:35.000 --> 05:54:39.160
I want to share a few important points. First, the Charter Schools Act clearly states the

05:54:39.160 --> 05:54:43.720
establishment of charter schools shall be encouraged. I can tell you that never once

05:54:43.720 --> 05:54:49.640
throughout this entire process were we encouraged by LAUSD or LACO staff. Rather, it's been a fairly

05:54:49.640 --> 05:54:54.840
obvious witch hunt to try and figure out how to deny VISTA legacy. Second, according to LAUSD's

05:54:54.840 --> 05:55:00.600
own numbers, the fiscal impact is one 10,000th of the district's budget and that is not going to

05:55:00.600 --> 05:55:05.960
substantially undermine any programs. This could set a very dangerous precedent in California

05:55:06.440 --> 05:55:12.120
that any minor financial impact can be deemed a substantial impact. And third, we have a sound

05:55:12.120 --> 05:55:17.800
budget that we stand by based on our plan to co-locate at our current private site in LA.

05:55:17.800 --> 05:55:22.760
We don't plan to use Prop 39, but if we did, LACO's assumption that our budget is incorrect,

05:55:24.600 --> 05:55:28.040
LACO's assumption that our budget are incorrect, and it would actually cost us less.

05:55:28.680 --> 05:55:34.840
LACO and LAUSD abuse their discretion. We are a proven charter operator with a high quality

05:55:34.840 --> 05:55:50.920
charter petition. Thank you. Good afternoon. My name is Karen Amaya, Assistant Superintendent

05:55:50.920 --> 05:55:54.920
of VISTA Charter Public Schools. I'm here to ask that you approve the charter petition for

05:55:54.920 --> 05:56:01.960
VISTA Legacy Global Academy. Both LAUSD and LACO allege that our program is a duplicative program

05:56:01.960 --> 05:56:07.400
at the district. While three LAUSD schools might offer one aspect, our programs have been

05:56:07.400 --> 05:56:12.200
intentionally curated to provide a rigorous- Pardon me. I'm sorry to interrupt. Council,

05:56:12.200 --> 05:56:16.280
can you advise, because I know we have very strict restrictions on 10 minutes for either side.

05:56:16.920 --> 05:56:20.440
If we have VISTA representatives testifying outside of the 10 minutes,

05:56:20.440 --> 05:56:22.440
I believe that may be out of order. Council.

05:56:32.680 --> 05:56:36.680
Can I continue or-

05:56:40.360 --> 05:56:42.840
Hold on. We just have Council weighing in with an opinion. Thank you.

05:56:50.520 --> 05:56:53.960
Thank you. I think that's the second public comment from

05:56:54.680 --> 05:57:01.240
VISTA, and it counts towards the 10 minute public hearing, so it would be out of order.

05:57:01.960 --> 05:57:11.800
What 10 minutes? Council, just to clarify,

05:57:11.800 --> 05:57:15.480
because we have a new question here. The distinction being, it's not being supporters,

05:57:15.480 --> 05:57:19.480
it's when you actually are an employee or representative of the charter itself.

05:57:20.840 --> 05:57:24.760
That's correct. I think the last two were representatives of the charter petitioner.

05:57:31.960 --> 05:57:41.320
For public comment.

05:57:52.440 --> 05:57:57.400
That's correct. Just to clarify, if there are representatives of either parties that are

05:57:57.400 --> 05:58:00.360
offering public comment right now, that would be out of order.

05:58:02.920 --> 05:58:06.920
Yeah, I was speaking as a member of the public. That's why I signed up for public comment.

05:58:08.280 --> 05:58:11.720
You identified yourself as a representative of VISTA, right?

05:58:13.080 --> 05:58:18.520
Yeah. Yeah, I'm an employee of VISTA.

05:58:21.160 --> 05:58:24.600
I think we finished this public comment, and then I think we move on to the next. But

05:58:25.320 --> 05:58:31.400
further public comments from representatives of either of the parties here today would be out of

05:58:31.400 --> 05:58:41.560
order. Other employees can't make public comments? Okay, so I'll finish.

05:58:47.000 --> 05:58:52.200
Both LAUSD and LACO allege that our program is duplicative of a program at the district.

05:58:52.200 --> 05:58:56.360
While three LAUSD schools might offer one aspect, our programs have been intentionally curated to

05:58:56.360 --> 05:59:01.160
provide a rigorous education and to meet the needs of our historically underserved students

05:59:01.160 --> 05:59:06.920
and families. A VISTA student would have to enroll at three schools at once, three LAUSD

05:59:06.920 --> 05:59:11.240
schools at once, which is illegal, to have access to all of our programs. And if a student wanted

05:59:11.240 --> 05:59:15.080
to continue developing their global competence through high school, they would have to drive

05:59:15.080 --> 05:59:21.800
over 20 miles to find another ISSN school, while still being duly enrolled in community

05:59:21.800 --> 05:59:28.920
college classes. Board member Ms. Ayapan, congratulations on your appointment to our

05:59:28.920 --> 05:59:33.400
state board. As someone who is already enrolled in high school while taking courses at Diablo

05:59:33.400 --> 05:59:38.920
Valley College, you know the importance of access to a high-quality program. Board members, due to

05:59:38.920 --> 05:59:43.880
the abuse of discretion, I ask for your approval of VISTA Legacy Global Academy Charter Petition.

05:59:43.880 --> 05:59:54.920
Thank you. Good afternoon, President Darling-Hammond and SBE members. My name is Angela Stiegel,

05:59:54.920 --> 06:00:00.040
I'm a classroom teacher representing the California Teachers Association. As stated by my colleague

06:00:00.040 --> 06:00:05.640
during public comment for item number nine, AB 1505 established an abuse of discretion standard

06:00:05.640 --> 06:00:12.360
that is the most deferential standard of review. SB 114 further clarified that under this process,

06:00:12.360 --> 06:00:16.200
the state board must give deference to the decisions of the governing board of the school

06:00:16.200 --> 06:00:21.960
district and the county board of education to deny the petition. The documentary record clearly

06:00:21.960 --> 06:00:27.400
outlines that the denials were the outcome of robust local analysis, deliberation, and governance

06:00:27.400 --> 06:00:33.080
by the LAUSD board and the Los Angeles county board. Despite this, the petitioners are appealing

06:00:33.080 --> 06:00:39.240
because they do not like or agree with the outcome. CTA urges the SBE to affirm the local decisions

06:00:39.240 --> 06:00:44.360
of the LAUSD and LACBO and to deny the petitioner's abuse of discretion appeal. Thank you.

06:00:44.360 --> 06:00:55.720
Good afternoon, President and members of the board. Carlos Machado with the California School

06:00:55.720 --> 06:01:01.480
Boards Association. CSBA urges the board to give deference to the decisions by the governing boards

06:01:01.480 --> 06:01:07.800
of the LA Unified School District and the LA County Board of Education in this matter as required

06:01:07.800 --> 06:01:18.120
by law. SB 114, which changed the law and clarified that the state board may only reverse denials on

06:01:18.120 --> 06:01:24.440
appeal if it determines that there was abuse of discretion by each of the local governing boards.

06:01:24.440 --> 06:01:30.440
The bill further clarified that under the standard of review, the state board must give deference to

06:01:30.440 --> 06:01:35.160
decisions of the governing board of the school district and the county board of education to

06:01:35.160 --> 06:01:41.160
deny the petition. CSBA urges the state board to follow the staff recommendation to affirm the

06:01:41.160 --> 06:01:48.520
determinations by the LAUSD and LACO to deny the petition. Thank you.

06:01:58.040 --> 06:02:02.440
I take it that's all of the comment in the room. Would you like to move to public comment on the

We are entitled to have a safe environment for our children, and I demand the approval

Charter Middle School. I've seen the positive impact my kid has developed for learning and

being more interested in more subjects than at his elementary school. We hope to continue

06:09:01.720 --> 06:09:06.280

Hello. My name is Sammy Salasoli. I am a seventh grader attending Vista Charter Middle School,

06:11:22.200 --> 06:11:26.440
and today I'm here to advocate for my fellow peers and I to ask for a high school,

06:11:26.440 --> 06:11:31.880
as I know that having a new high school will benefit us in many ways. Gaining sports skills

06:11:31.880 --> 06:11:37.880
from me being in soccer team two times has shown me leadership for giving captain privileges and,

06:11:37.880 --> 06:11:42.520
most importantly, for having opportunities to continue and grow memories with my fellow peers

06:11:42.520 --> 06:11:48.520
until we make it a college into our next big step. One of the other experiences I had at Vista

06:11:48.520 --> 06:11:55.160
is leadership. After school, there's a group called leadership and they teach us how to be a leader

06:11:55.160 --> 06:12:00.840
and how to help out around the community. As we've been fighting for a chance to keep our

06:12:00.840 --> 06:12:06.680
family together, we hope you will understand as we truly to our goals and give us opportunities

06:12:06.680 --> 06:12:11.880
for the students and our future, future new students. Please open our high school. Thank you.

Good afternoon. My name is Maria Espinoza. I have two children in Vista Middle School,

06:13:58.680 --> 06:14:03.960
in grade seven and eight. They were in another school, but they always told me that they were

06:14:03.960 --> 06:14:08.360
bad. But thank God that I changed them and I am very grateful to Vista Middle School and

06:14:08.360 --> 06:14:14.680
their teachers, who are very professional. Now my children are in and out of school. I tell them

06:14:14.680 --> 06:14:20.520
all their subjects and they feel more secure. Now they know that what they propose they can do.

06:14:20.520 --> 06:14:24.520
That is why I ask you to give us the permission for the preparatory school,

06:14:24.520 --> 06:14:28.840
Vista, so that they continue well or better every day. Thank you.

06:14:35.560 --> 06:14:44.200
Good afternoon. My name is Maria Espinoza. I have two children at Vista, one in seventh grade and

06:14:44.200 --> 06:14:50.600
one in eighth grade. Before, they weren't doing that well at other schools. Thank God,

06:14:50.600 --> 06:14:57.160
we had Vista as an option and the teachers there are magnificent. Now my children

06:14:59.160 --> 06:15:07.480
are obtaining As and A pluses in all their classes and they're of maximum quality.

06:15:08.360 --> 06:15:15.160
Um, we ask you to please approve the proposal of having

06:15:17.160 --> 06:15:23.720
this wonderful school available to them. Now they believe that whatever they propose

06:15:24.440 --> 06:15:35.640
to achieve, it's achievable and it's going to be good or even better if this school is approved.

Hi, good afternoon. My name is Nico and I'm an eighth grader at Vista Charter Middle School.

06:20:47.480 --> 06:20:51.960
The reason I would like to continue as a Vista Legacy student is because of the wonderful

06:20:51.960 --> 06:20:56.840
experiences. Some of the experiences I've been through the school years I've been here is Baltimore,

06:20:56.840 --> 06:21:01.160
Think Together and Leadership. Now I'm going to talk about my experiences versus Baltimore.

06:21:01.160 --> 06:21:06.280
In Baltimore, we presented on the stray animal problems in LA to a group of important people.

06:21:06.280 --> 06:21:11.000
After that presentation, we were able to go to important monuments, which could only be a once

06:21:11.000 --> 06:21:15.960
in a lifetime opportunity. Next, we're going to talk about leadership. Leadership helped me

06:21:15.960 --> 06:21:21.400
with being a leader and many fun opportunities. One of the opportunities was being able to go to

06:21:21.400 --> 06:21:27.320
Disneyland as we were able to go to Disneyland through our hard work and it's also a leadership

06:21:27.320 --> 06:21:32.920
conference. After that, we were going to talk about Think Together. Think Together is one of

06:21:32.920 --> 06:21:36.920
the best after school programs. It's one of the best because of yes clubs. Some of the clubs are

06:21:36.920 --> 06:21:41.880
basketball, football, arts and crafts. Think Together gives great opportunities to go places.

06:21:41.880 --> 06:21:46.680
For example, two weeks ago we went to the Dodger Stadium and went world watching. Those field trips

06:21:46.680 --> 06:21:54.120
were extremely fun and exciting. Okay, thank you. Your time is up. Next caller ending in 0127,

Hola, buenas tardes. Mi nombre es Ana y soy madre de un estudiante de séptimo grado. Mi estudiante

06:23:17.400 --> 06:23:24.600
ha tenido muy buena experiencia en Charter Middle School y me gustaría que mi estudiante

Academy pueda ser aprobada para que pueda mi hija seguir preparándose para poder llegar a la

06:23:40.120 --> 06:23:48.520

Good afternoon. My name is Nadia. I'm an eighth grader at Vista Charter Middle School.

06:24:24.280 --> 06:24:28.440
My experience here at Vista has impacted my everyday life in terms of school and sports.

06:24:28.440 --> 06:24:32.440
One way that it has impacted me is by playing sports because it has helped me to learn leadership

06:24:32.440 --> 06:24:36.920
skills but also how to work as a team with other students. The teachers at Vista have supported me

06:24:36.920 --> 06:24:41.160
in learning new academic skills and have good grades. Vista has forever been my home and I

06:24:41.160 --> 06:24:45.400
truly believe it has helped me grow into the person I am today. With that being said,

06:24:45.400 --> 06:24:49.880
I would love to continue to go through Vista Legacy. One last reason as to why I believe

06:24:49.880 --> 06:24:54.280
the school will benefit myself and my peers is because I will be familiar with

06:24:54.280 --> 06:24:59.480
the people that enroll there but also have the opportunity to be part of such a loving environment

06:24:59.480 --> 06:25:03.880
that cares about my well-being, my community, and my education as a whole. For that reason,

06:25:03.880 --> 06:25:08.280
I want to petition for the approval of the High School Vista Legacy Global Academy to further

06:25:08.280 --> 06:25:14.680

Hello. My name is Eric Molina. I have three children in the Vista Charter School system.

One child who has done the transition from elementary to middle school. I have seen

06:25:35.240 --> 06:25:45.000
a major improvement on all three of them. An example, when you cut the process of an

06:25:45.000 --> 06:25:51.480
athletic team or any other kind of team that is giving you extremely good results,

06:25:52.360 --> 06:25:59.160

The reason I'm here is to support Vista Legacy Global Academy. To approve the school,

06:26:33.240 --> 06:26:39.000

06:26:58.360 --> 06:27:05.960

06:28:58.200 --> 06:29:09.240

not being met at the local high school, the high school that they are assigned to attend

06:31:10.200 --> 06:31:16.040
because of our address and zip code. I know the local high schools and I know they will not support

06:31:16.040 --> 06:31:22.760
my child the way Vista does. I know this because I attended the high schools and nothing has changed

06:31:22.760 --> 06:31:29.400
since the 90s. Vista Charter Middle School has provided my child with special education services

06:31:29.400 --> 06:31:34.840
for the past two years with no issues or concerns. They have started to shape my

06:31:34.840 --> 06:31:41.880
child to be a global citizen and I want them to continue at Vista Legacy. I want my child to

06:31:41.880 --> 06:31:47.960

but unfortunately they do not meet my expectations, so I ask for your support to

06:45:31.720 --> 06:45:40.280

Hello. My name is Soyla. I am the parent of four students. My oldest was not able to

attend the high school that is here now, but my three other children are at the middle school and

06:46:48.280 --> 06:46:55.000
the elementary. My first one was very sad about that, by the way. I am a proud parent. I've been

06:46:55.000 --> 06:47:05.320
with VISTA for about six or seven years here in Santa Ana. One of my children is in special

06:47:05.320 --> 06:47:10.760
education, and with the help of VISTA, Condor Global Academy, he went from being a non-verbal

06:47:10.760 --> 06:47:19.640
child to a verbal child. I also would like to point out that these and more parents showed up

06:47:19.640 --> 06:47:27.160
to the city and the county. This is why we are here, because the community spoke, and we were

06:47:27.160 --> 06:47:33.080
not listened. They did not only deny the schools every single time that they petitioned them,

06:47:33.080 --> 06:47:40.440
they also denied the community, as you can hear today. So I am calling in support of VISTA

06:47:40.440 --> 06:47:46.520
Legacy Global Academy, because the LA Middle School students deserve a community school.

06:47:47.320 --> 06:47:51.000
Thank you. Your time is up. Next caller, ending in 9352.

Caller ending in 9352.

06:48:25.640 --> 06:48:34.520
I am calling in support of the LA School of VISTA because my children are currently going

06:48:34.520 --> 06:48:41.000
to this school in Santa Ana, and they have helped them a lot. They have special classes.

06:48:42.280 --> 06:48:50.760
Currently, where they came to this school, they fought a lot to find them, because they

06:48:51.720 --> 06:48:58.840
did not find that they had the services that they needed in their IEP, or in others they did not have

06:48:58.840 --> 06:49:08.200
enough space for more students. So when I came to see them, they immediately accepted them,

06:49:08.200 --> 06:49:18.680
and they have helped them a lot in their studies. Thank you very much, and thank you for everything.

06:49:18.760 --> 06:49:39.000
Good afternoon. My name is Rosario Ruiz. I am the mother of Gianluca in the 9th grade and Alexandra

06:49:39.000 --> 06:49:47.640
in the 11th grade. They attend Santa Ana High School, and I am here to support the opening of

06:49:47.640 --> 06:49:58.280
the LA High School. My children, they have helped them a great deal. They attend special classes.

06:50:01.160 --> 06:50:09.080
We were unable to find services like they offer at VISTA elsewhere, either because

06:50:10.200 --> 06:50:15.880
they didn't offer them or because they didn't have space. And when we came to VISTA,

06:50:16.680 --> 06:50:24.600
they were accepted immediately, and they have been supported tremendously academically and

06:50:24.600 --> 06:50:31.560
in all ways. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller ending in 9877, please state your

Hello. Good afternoon. My name is Monica Chabon. I have a student that attends the 6th grade at

06:51:43.080 --> 06:51:49.000
VISTA Charter School. I am asking you to please approve VISTA Global Academy High School.

06:51:51.640 --> 06:52:01.320
My child enjoys excellent and high-quality education. I am very happy that my son can

06:52:01.320 --> 06:52:08.600
be part of such a program, and he feels happy and secure and safe, and that's why I'm asking you to

06:52:08.600 --> 06:52:15.800
please approve the school. Thank you. Next caller ending in 6344, please state your name

Good afternoon. I am a student of the 7th grade. I've had a wonderful experience. I've learned

06:53:25.400 --> 06:53:32.600
great abilities at the school. I'm asking you to please open the school so that we can have,

06:53:32.600 --> 06:53:41.560
all the students can have the great opportunities that I've had. They have not only helped me

06:53:41.560 --> 06:54:00.600
academically, but they help us to learn all sorts of things, including empathy and other values.

06:54:01.080 --> 06:54:06.440

Hello. My name is Susan Mott. I'm the executive director of Generation Now Initiative at VISTA

06:54:20.200 --> 06:54:27.560
Global Academy. We have been working with VISTA for the past three years. Our goal is to provide

06:54:27.560 --> 06:54:33.000
young people for life in the 21st century by providing them the knowledge, skills,

06:54:33.000 --> 06:54:38.440
and experiences needed to find solutions for the sustainability of our planet.

06:54:39.240 --> 06:54:46.200
VISTA was invited by the University of California Irvine to participate in the launch of the Eclipse

06:54:46.200 --> 06:54:53.880
Initiative, an initiative of the UC and CSU systems, the environmental and climate change projects.

06:54:54.760 --> 06:55:05.160
A VISTA alumni was selected to be one of the main speakers at this UC event. She represented all the

06:55:05.160 --> 06:55:11.880
young people of this generation who are taking action to create a sustainable planet. This year

06:55:11.880 --> 06:55:19.320
we are working with UCI and the business community to develop career paths in the sustainable pathways

06:55:19.720 --> 06:55:24.280
that will act as a model for schools throughout California. Thank you. Your time is up.

Alviera, VISTA charter school board member. I know the big question is why. I think the simple

06:55:44.920 --> 06:55:50.520
answer is to help our students speak higher education. Their fate and their educational

06:55:50.520 --> 06:55:59.480
journey is at your doorstep. We know that LACO had a split vote of 4-3, which we think that

06:55:59.480 --> 06:56:06.040
does speak volumes in relation to having three board members approve our petition. We really

06:56:06.040 --> 06:56:12.600
do ask that you let our students continue their educational pathways so they may pave their own

06:56:12.600 --> 06:56:19.720
legacy. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller ending in 5808, please state your name and affiliation

06:56:19.720 --> 06:56:28.520
for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now. My name is Rainbow Crew Munoz.

06:56:31.000 --> 06:56:37.000
I'm a parent of a first grader at Tomlin Global Academy charter school in Anaheim.

06:56:37.400 --> 06:56:42.120
My son didn't even want to come to school before. He would cry and say he didn't want to go to

06:56:42.120 --> 06:56:48.920
school. He loves all the teachers and the staff and the principal and everybody so much. Now he

06:56:48.920 --> 06:56:56.280
makes excuses to stay after school just to visit with everybody and stay longer because he feels

06:56:56.280 --> 06:57:17.320
so comfortable here. Thank you. Sorry, please continue. Are you finished? Yes. Thank you very

06:57:17.320 --> 06:57:22.840
much. Next caller ending in 0012, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You

06:57:22.840 --> 06:57:32.680
have one minute. Your time starts now. Hi, my name is Maria. I am the sister of a student who

06:57:32.680 --> 06:57:43.400
goes here to Tomlin. She has been coming to Tomlin since 2018 and since this has been affiliated,

06:57:43.400 --> 06:57:48.520
she has had an immediate impact from the educators and the students in the community.

06:57:49.160 --> 06:57:53.320
She is now a educator and she started when she was in first grade.

06:57:53.320 --> 06:58:01.240
So she was non-verbal and extremely aggressive since she started with the elementary.

06:58:02.040 --> 06:58:09.240
She has been able to talk and express her feelings through words and it's been a tremendous change

06:58:10.120 --> 06:58:16.840
in her life and ours. So we support Vista and we would love to see

06:58:16.840 --> 06:58:23.240
this high school appear for her and she would be honored to go to this school. Thank you.

06:58:24.120 --> 06:58:29.160
Thank you. Next caller ending in 8945, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

06:58:39.880 --> 06:58:45.080
CSPC supports reversing the local decisions because we believe the petitioners have submitted

06:58:45.080 --> 06:58:50.680
extensive evidence of abuse of discretion at both the district and county boards.

06:58:50.680 --> 06:58:57.640
We believe CDE's analysis misses some important key context. Specifically, California appellate

06:58:57.640 --> 06:59:04.360
courts have ruled that even the most deferential standard needs to be applied in the larger

06:59:04.360 --> 06:59:10.360
statutory context. Statute mandates that the establishment of charter schools shall be

06:59:10.360 --> 06:59:17.880
encouraged. The district and county have a burden to meet the standards such as demonstrably unlikely

06:59:17.880 --> 06:59:24.440
to succeed. We believe the scant findings of the district and county do not meet even the most

06:59:24.440 --> 06:59:31.400
deferential standard. CDE's analysis misses this. Your action today is important to signal the

06:59:31.400 --> 06:59:38.280
importance of robust evidence-based decisions. Thanks so much. Thank you. Next caller ending in

07:00:09.960 --> 07:00:19.160
plus years of experience. I am also an attorney and I agree with the conviction that the evidence

07:00:20.040 --> 07:00:27.160
did not show that VISTA would not succeed. VISTA has a terrific success record,

07:00:27.160 --> 07:00:34.680
astounding success record. The community wants to send their children onto the high school and I

07:00:34.680 --> 07:00:43.320
implore decision makers to please vote in favor of VISTA continuing with the high school. Thank

Hello, my name is Emmanuel Rodriguez and I'm part of the VISTA community. I'm in eighth grade and

07:01:12.120 --> 07:01:18.760
I'm in VISTA. My experience in VISTA has been an enormous opportunity for me and for my

07:01:18.760 --> 07:01:24.760
little sister. Ever since my little sister went to VISTA Horizon, I've been very and deeply grateful

07:01:24.760 --> 07:01:31.080
for VISTA because before she was in another school, she was very behind and she didn't know

07:01:31.080 --> 07:01:38.680
anything. Now that she's in VISTA, I've seen immense improvement with her and her grades.

07:01:40.600 --> 07:01:47.320
VISTA has offered me so many things such as the Baltimore project and all it takes. These things

07:01:47.320 --> 07:01:52.360
have helped me grow in my social skills and everything else. I'm so grateful for VISTA and

07:01:52.360 --> 07:01:58.760
I beg you to please open VISTA Legacy because I wish that me and my little sister can have an

07:01:58.760 --> 07:02:06.280
opportunity to go to VISTA and be in VISTA until college. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller ending

07:02:12.040 --> 07:02:20.520
starts now. Are you able to hear me? Yes. Hi, good afternoon. My name is David Levinson. I am a

07:02:20.520 --> 07:02:25.000
sixth grade elementary school teacher at Santa Monica Boulevard Charter School. We are about

07:02:25.000 --> 07:02:31.800
three miles away from VISTA. I have been working at this school for 25 years. I can speak firsthand

07:02:31.800 --> 07:02:37.000
on saying that I know practically every single middle school and high school within a 10-mile

07:02:37.000 --> 07:02:42.840
radius. I work as part of my job with helping matriculate our students into middle schools

07:02:42.840 --> 07:02:48.440
and for the last several years VISTA has always been my number one choice. I have several students

07:02:48.440 --> 07:02:53.800
past and present that I am still in touch with that have attended VISTA and I know firsthand the

07:02:53.800 --> 07:02:59.160
administration and many of the staff members there and I can tell you that it would definitely

07:02:59.160 --> 07:03:06.600
benefit the local community if the VISTA Legacy was able to continue and move on as a high school.

07:03:07.240 --> 07:03:12.760
I strongly support that you make a positive decision and help these students that are currently

07:03:12.760 --> 07:03:19.400
attending VISTA to move on to the same high school. Thank you very much. Thank you. This

07:03:19.400 --> 07:03:27.640
concludes public comment for item number 10. Thank you very much. I ask all the board members

07:03:27.640 --> 07:03:36.280
to get ready for discussion and I will at this point declare the public hearing closed at 5.01

07:03:36.920 --> 07:03:46.520
p.m. and I'll ask our liaisons if they want to make any public comments by Vice President

07:03:46.520 --> 07:03:54.280
Glover-Woods and Member Olken. Thank you President Darling-Hammond. I'd first like to thank all of

07:03:54.280 --> 07:04:01.160
the parents that called in and the students who spoke so eloquently both those who called

07:04:01.160 --> 07:04:05.640
in from Los Angeles and those who've called in from Orange County. Thank you so much for sharing

07:04:05.640 --> 07:04:12.840
your thoughts and your passion about VISTA. I just would like to as we get ready to get into our

07:04:12.840 --> 07:04:20.120
discussion as a board just reiterate our role as a board as it relates to charter appeals.

07:04:20.840 --> 07:04:29.160
Understanding that we do have two options. One is to overturn the decisions of the county board

07:04:29.160 --> 07:04:34.680
and the school district if there is an abuse of discretion and we'll need to be clear on what that

07:04:34.680 --> 07:04:42.200
abuse of discretion is or to uphold the decisions that were made at the district and county board

07:04:42.200 --> 07:04:49.000
level. So that's all I'll say at this point. I'll leave it for a conversation and share more

07:04:49.000 --> 07:04:58.520
thoughts as we move forward. Thank you. Member Olken. Thank you. Yeah I want to echo the

07:04:59.800 --> 07:05:08.760
gratitude for those who called in and as a school leader those are exactly the types of

07:05:10.280 --> 07:05:17.720
testimony that you just hope for and you know it's how you know you're making a difference

07:05:18.440 --> 07:05:28.680
and so you know I appreciate those who called in and I also appreciate what we heard about

07:05:28.680 --> 07:05:38.440
the great work of VISTA in both LA and Orange County. Just want to start with that and you know

07:05:38.440 --> 07:05:44.040
I echo what Vice President Glover-Wood said about remembering what our role is here today

07:05:44.040 --> 07:05:54.760
in terms of within the confines of 1505. And I do also think you know I know I have some questions

07:05:54.760 --> 07:06:01.560
that I'd like to have some clarification on but I think it's important that we keep in mind

07:06:02.360 --> 07:06:09.560
well both the confines of 1505 but also has been brought up on multiple occasions. The

07:06:09.560 --> 07:06:15.080
intent of charter school law which hasn't changed which is that that charter schools

07:06:15.800 --> 07:06:20.120
the establishment of charter schools should be encouraged and supported unless there's

07:06:22.280 --> 07:06:26.840
period that they should be supported and encouraged as part of the public school system.

07:06:26.840 --> 07:06:32.520
I just want to put that in as well. Thank you. I'm going to also add a comment and then hopefully

07:06:32.520 --> 07:06:39.480
we can work with you on that. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

07:06:39.560 --> 07:06:47.000
I move to discussion and emotion. I also very much appreciate the callers, the parents and the

07:06:47.000 --> 07:06:54.600
students who called in. I do want to clarify that under the current law it is not our role to approve

07:06:54.600 --> 07:07:00.440
the charter only to evaluate whether there's been an abuse of discretion. So that's I think

07:07:00.440 --> 07:07:06.840
there's sometimes a little misunderstanding about what we are being asked to do. We are not in a

07:07:06.840 --> 07:07:16.280
position to approve the charter in our role. Current law specifies that the state board can

07:07:16.280 --> 07:07:23.640
only reverse a decision of the district and the county upon a finding of abuse of discretion at

07:07:23.640 --> 07:07:30.200
both levels. That it is the most deferential standard of review that it does not permit us

07:07:30.200 --> 07:07:36.120
to reevaluate the evidence that was considered by the district and the county boards or to

07:07:36.120 --> 07:07:41.960
exercise our independent judgment on that evidence. So there may be tension between

07:07:41.960 --> 07:07:50.920
the original charter law and AB 1505 and SB 114. However, it is not our role to resolve that

07:07:50.920 --> 07:07:59.640
tension. That's something that will have to be done by the legislature. So our framework is that

07:07:59.640 --> 07:08:05.720
we've been instructed that if there's at least one ground of denial where there was no evidence

07:08:05.720 --> 07:08:11.160
of an abuse of discretion, the law dictates that the charter denial will be upheld.

07:08:12.200 --> 07:08:18.680
And based on the documentary record, I believe there is at least one such ground for denial that

07:08:18.680 --> 07:08:24.680
we are obligated under the law to uphold because the petitioner did not contend it was an abuse

07:08:24.680 --> 07:08:31.240
of discretion. And in the record we have before us, the petitioner did not challenge LAUSD's

07:08:31.240 --> 07:08:35.960
finding that the petition did not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all 15

07:08:36.520 --> 07:08:44.360
required elements of a charter petition under 47605. So I do believe that applying the appropriate

07:08:44.360 --> 07:08:49.240
level of deference to the district and county's findings as required by the abuse of discretion

07:08:49.240 --> 07:08:57.400
standard, there does not appear to be an adequate support for us to overturn the decision of the

07:08:57.400 --> 07:09:04.680
district and the county. And while we might have wanted to approve the charter if that was our

07:09:05.400 --> 07:09:11.960
role, that is not the decision that we have before us. And with that I'll open it to any

07:09:11.960 --> 07:09:22.120
other questions, discussion, and eventually a motion. Yes, Member Olken.

07:09:22.120 --> 07:09:30.120
Thank you. You touched on exactly where my question is and so thank you for teeing me up

07:09:31.320 --> 07:09:37.640
and also for, you know, framing the discussion and what's on the table and what is not. I

07:09:37.640 --> 07:09:49.720
appreciate that. So my questions are, I think, for the department just as a preface. And they're

07:09:49.720 --> 07:09:57.800
intended to check and clarify my understanding of the standard of review that we are operating in.

07:09:58.840 --> 07:10:05.800
So sort of I start with a couple of things I think everybody agrees on. So I think everybody,

07:10:06.760 --> 07:10:13.560
I heard consistently that our review is limited to determining whether the decision to deny the

07:10:13.560 --> 07:10:18.760
charter was arbitrary, capricious, entirely lacking in evidentiary support, unlawful or

07:10:18.760 --> 07:10:27.560
procedurally unfair, right? Everyone agrees on that. It also seems that everyone agrees with

07:10:27.560 --> 07:10:33.800
the idea that governing boards at the district and county must make written factual findings

07:10:34.680 --> 07:10:47.160
if they deny. Yeah, okay. So one place where I did hear, I think, a difference in interpretation

07:10:47.160 --> 07:10:53.240
of the law from those who presented was the point that President Darling-Hammond just made about,

07:10:55.800 --> 07:11:02.680
well, this statement, which is in, I think it's on slide four from your presentation.

07:11:03.800 --> 07:11:08.520
If even one basis for denial is supported by evidence and the record,

07:11:08.600 --> 07:11:15.400
the determination to deny should be affirmed. So let me go back to,

07:11:17.320 --> 07:11:22.600
yep, so on yours under standard of review, it's slide four. It's the last bullet. If even one

07:11:22.600 --> 07:11:27.560
basis for denial is supported by evidence and the record, the determination to deny should be

07:11:27.560 --> 07:11:36.920
affirmed. I definitely heard a different interpretation of the standard in the

07:11:36.920 --> 07:11:44.760
presentation from the petitioners, and so I'm asking if you can help me understand how we got

07:11:44.760 --> 07:11:52.040
to that understanding of the law. Thank you.

07:11:54.920 --> 07:11:59.800
Thank you for your question, Member Olken. I'm going to go ahead and pass it over to Craig

07:11:59.800 --> 07:12:03.880
Heimbichner. He's the education administrator for our charter schools division. Thank you.

07:12:05.080 --> 07:12:10.840
Thank you, Nancy. Thank you, Member Olken. Maybe the easiest way to get at this one is to reference

07:12:10.840 --> 07:12:19.160
the Maya Commons court case and the comments of Judge Chang, and Judge Chang did emphasize

07:12:20.200 --> 07:12:24.760
that a finding could only be an abuse of discretion if it was entirely lacking in

07:12:24.760 --> 07:12:30.840
evidentiary support. So if we turn that around, it would mean that there would only be an abuse

07:12:30.840 --> 07:12:37.480
of discretion if there was no supported basis for denial. You unpack that one more level,

07:12:38.440 --> 07:12:45.560
and that means that a district or county really only needs one basis to deny a petition, and

07:12:45.560 --> 07:12:54.280
therefore it puts a burden on the petitioner to show that all findings are unsupported. So

07:12:54.280 --> 07:13:01.160
if there's only one, that ruling said basically there's an evidentiary basis and it couldn't be

07:13:01.160 --> 07:13:07.320
an abuse of discretion. So that would be our basic way to understand that in the light of the latest

07:13:08.280 --> 07:13:18.280
latest court ruling on this. Thank you. This is important enough that I would, because I'm a,

07:13:20.280 --> 07:13:23.800
I want to make sure I really get it. Can you say it one more time just to make sure I

07:13:24.440 --> 07:13:27.080
Yes. You were clear it's just a lot for me to

07:13:27.080 --> 07:13:34.440
Oh, I totally sympathize with all of the, you're hearing many different interpretations of

07:13:35.000 --> 07:13:40.120
standard of review, and that can be a bit confusing. I totally understand that,

07:13:41.240 --> 07:13:46.920
and that's why I wanted to really reference the most recent court ruling on this that applies

07:13:46.920 --> 07:13:53.880
directly to a charter school that came before this body. And that court ruling did say that

07:13:54.760 --> 07:14:02.040
a finding could only be an abuse of discretion if it was entirely lacking in evidentiary support.

07:14:03.000 --> 07:14:08.120
That means that if there's one finding it's not entirely lacking in evidentiary support,

07:14:08.120 --> 07:14:15.960
if one is upheld, if one is not addressed by the petitioner and it stands, then it can't possibly

07:14:15.960 --> 07:14:22.440
be an abuse of discretion. That's our basis for continuing to apply the standard of review the

07:14:22.520 --> 07:14:34.200
way we do. I hope that answers your question. I think I see maybe Council coming up to step in.

07:14:34.200 --> 07:14:37.320
Yeah, thank you. Len Garfinkel.

07:14:37.320 --> 07:14:39.880
Thank you. Yeah, thank you. And thank you, Craig.

07:14:40.760 --> 07:14:47.080
What Craig said, I mean, it really ties back to in the statute in 47605C,

07:14:47.720 --> 07:14:54.840
where it refers to the denial of the petition being supported by one or more of the following

07:14:54.840 --> 07:15:03.080
finding. And so if the district laid out three different bases, or the county laid out two

07:15:03.080 --> 07:15:09.960
different bases for why they were denying, if one of those bases is supported, that's sufficient.

07:15:10.760 --> 07:15:15.080
Thank you. That makes sense. Just to push for one more second,

07:15:18.360 --> 07:15:25.480
I could imagine a scenario in which there would be a finding that is

07:15:28.360 --> 07:15:38.840
not, that is, that stands in essence. But there's also places that are capricious, unlawful,

07:15:40.920 --> 07:15:53.080
total, like within, within the process. But I'm trying to stay really clear on what I'm asking.

07:15:55.720 --> 07:16:00.920
Are you asking, Sharon, whether if there is something about the proceedings that is arbitrary

07:16:00.920 --> 07:16:05.720
or capricious, even if there is one? Yeah, I mean, if you have a finding whether,

07:16:06.360 --> 07:16:11.400
so if you had, if you, I mean, if you had, because

07:16:13.720 --> 07:16:19.160
the point that you made, President Ellingham, and that about the specific finding that wasn't

07:16:19.160 --> 07:16:31.160
addressed in the appeal, you know, was, I think makes sense and is clear. Like, I agree with you

07:16:31.160 --> 07:16:44.360
that way. And I could envision, you know, the findings are all, the findings are based on fact,

07:16:45.000 --> 07:16:54.040
and yet, the, you know, the process is, is unfair or, or capricious, right? And so,

07:16:55.000 --> 07:17:05.400
and so it's, if that's the, if needing to, if anytime there's one finding that isn't

07:17:07.480 --> 07:17:17.880
refuted by the petitioner, the petition, we cannot overturn the lower, the rulings.

07:17:18.680 --> 07:17:22.520
I feel like we're only honoring part of what the statute says.

07:17:23.960 --> 07:17:28.680
Well, we've read the statute in progression, right, where it says that the role is...

07:17:28.680 --> 07:17:31.720
Lynn, can you get close to the microphone? Thank you.

07:17:33.720 --> 07:17:40.680
The, the way the statute reads is, can affirm, or then, or...

07:17:40.680 --> 07:17:42.200
Maybe turn it on, also.

07:17:48.440 --> 07:17:58.280
Both of those things are important. You can affirm or deny for abusive discretion at both levels,

07:17:58.280 --> 07:18:09.000
right? And so, when the decision can be affirmed, that, in a sense, ends that discussion. There

07:18:09.000 --> 07:18:15.000
was not an abuse of discretion because the decision can be affirmed because the findings

07:18:15.000 --> 07:18:22.600
were supported. I think the question may be framed a different way. Could there be a situation

07:18:22.600 --> 07:18:31.240
where there was so significant a procedural error that, you know, it constitutes an abuse

07:18:31.240 --> 07:18:37.480
of discretion of, you know, whether or not findings are supported? You know, I think what

07:18:37.480 --> 07:18:44.200
we would need to do here is simply look at this case and what was found here. I know that the

07:18:44.200 --> 07:18:51.160
CDE's findings say that, procedurally, they're not finding any abuse of discretion in any event.

07:18:51.160 --> 07:18:54.920
So, it may be sort of a hypothetical question with respect to this case.

07:18:55.640 --> 07:18:56.440
Yes, I think what you...

07:18:56.440 --> 07:18:59.160
Would you like to encourage us to leave the hypothetical questions?

07:18:59.160 --> 07:19:00.760
No, I appreciate that was, yeah, that was...

07:19:01.800 --> 07:19:06.360
So, that was, that was, thank you. The way you just described that was very helpful,

07:19:06.360 --> 07:19:10.360
both in that it was a hypothetical concern that I have,

07:19:11.080 --> 07:19:17.080
and also the way you described, you, you reframed my question appropriately. So, thank you. I appreciate that.

07:19:21.080 --> 07:19:29.080
Are there any other further questions? Any further discussion? Or is there a motion?

07:19:29.080 --> 07:19:40.440
We have a motion for the recommendation. Member Lewis,

07:19:42.680 --> 07:19:45.000
is there any further discussion of the motion?

07:19:46.600 --> 07:19:55.560
All right, with that, all in favor say aye. Raise your hand. Aye. Any opposed? Any abstentions?

07:19:56.760 --> 07:19:58.040
I'm allowed to abstain.

07:19:58.280 --> 07:20:03.560
You're allowed to abstain. You're allowed to oppose or abstain, whatever you want to do.

07:20:04.360 --> 07:20:06.920
All right, one abstention and the motion carries.

07:20:09.320 --> 07:20:13.320
If you can manage it, I'd like to not take a break at this moment

07:20:14.040 --> 07:20:20.920
and just continue on to the close of the meeting. Is that okay? All right, and if you need a break,

07:20:21.560 --> 07:20:23.000
you know, take one individually.

07:20:26.280 --> 07:20:32.120
We're going to reopen item one to take action on the preliminary report of actions draft July

07:20:32.120 --> 07:20:38.760
2023 meeting minutes and report on our liaison assignments. And while we're waiting for any

07:20:38.760 --> 07:20:45.720
members of the public to call in, we'll need that public comment up. Do I have a motion from a board

07:20:45.720 --> 07:20:51.880
member to approve the July 2023 State Board of Education draft preliminary report of action

07:20:51.880 --> 07:21:01.400
meeting minutes? Member Rodriguez, thank you. And do I have a second? Second. Member Glover Woods,

07:21:02.520 --> 07:21:04.120
is there any public comment?

07:21:06.760 --> 07:21:14.360
There are no callers in the queue. Any further discussion? All right, all in favor say aye.

07:21:14.360 --> 07:21:19.160
And I'll show your hands, aye. Any opposed? Any abstentions? Anya.

07:21:22.840 --> 07:21:28.840
And now we have our liaison reports and I'll just encourage people to be succinct because some folks

07:21:28.840 --> 07:21:34.440
have travel arrangements and I'm trying to be respectful of those arrangements that they may

07:21:34.440 --> 07:21:40.360
be trying to make. And I'm going to begin by calling on board members in alphabetical order

07:21:41.080 --> 07:21:50.120
and I'll start, if that's okay, with our new member, Aya Pan. Of course. Can you hear me? Perfect.

07:21:56.760 --> 07:22:02.840
So since the application for the 24-25 student board member to the State Board of Education

07:22:02.840 --> 07:22:07.720
has been posted, I've been working with various students and student groups to get that publicized

07:22:07.720 --> 07:22:14.040
and out to as many people as possible. I was able to share the application with more than 50

07:22:14.040 --> 07:22:18.440
district student board members for them to apply if they're a junior and eligible

07:22:19.160 --> 07:22:23.400
or for them to pass on that information to student advisory groups within their district

07:22:23.400 --> 07:22:28.520
if they're interested. I've also begun collaborating with the California Association of Student

07:22:28.520 --> 07:22:34.200
Councils who runs the Student Advisory Board and Education Conference in November and are a key

07:22:34.200 --> 07:22:40.840
member of the selection process for the student board member role. So we've begun conversations,

07:22:40.840 --> 07:22:44.920
they've been able to post the application through their channels of communication

07:22:45.720 --> 07:22:49.800
and I look forward to staying in close contact with them and I have some meetings arranged

07:22:50.440 --> 07:22:54.360
with students from across the state of California so I'm really looking to hearing those diverse

07:22:54.360 --> 07:23:02.760
perspectives. I'll just keep it short so I'll leave it at that. Member Escobedo.

07:23:03.720 --> 07:23:11.480
Yes, as part of my role as the Westad Liaison, I spent a few days helping with the finalists

07:23:11.480 --> 07:23:17.880
and making a decision on the next CEO and proud to say to everyone that Janelle Kubanek

07:23:18.440 --> 07:23:25.240
is the new CEO for Westad. She was the organization's chief executive officer,

07:23:26.520 --> 07:23:32.360
administrative officer, she brings 24 years of experience, she's no stranger to California,

07:23:32.360 --> 07:23:39.080
she worked as a associate vice president for school services of California as well. She was

07:23:39.080 --> 07:23:48.360
a senior fiscal and policy analyst in our LAO so she knows California and would be great and we

07:23:48.360 --> 07:23:57.160
say goodbye to Glenn Harvey who was a CEO for 26 years. Amazing legacy. Yeah and under her

07:23:57.160 --> 07:24:02.760
leadership, Westad established itself as one of the nation's premier non-partisan research,

07:24:02.760 --> 07:24:08.520
development, and service organizations and I thank my colleagues. So many of my colleagues

07:24:08.520 --> 07:24:17.160
will be going to our NASB annual conference in San Diego on October 25th through 28th and

07:24:17.160 --> 07:24:24.760
looking forward to seeing many of you there. Thank you. Janelle has worked, she was very

07:24:24.760 --> 07:24:29.720
involved in the development of the dashboard and a lot of the other things that we work on today.

07:24:30.360 --> 07:24:36.600
Vice President Glover Woods. Thank you. Just a couple of quick updates regarding the CCEE

07:24:36.600 --> 07:24:42.840
California Collaborative for Educational Excellence. The first in-person meeting since the pandemic

07:24:42.840 --> 07:24:48.920
took place on August 31st, we got to hear an update on the schools that are receiving direct

07:24:48.920 --> 07:24:55.160
technical assistance from the organization. I also want to lift up that the Learning Acceleration

07:24:55.160 --> 07:25:04.120
Systems Grant. Under that particular grant there will be the 2023-24 Literacy and Mathematics

07:25:04.120 --> 07:25:10.280
Community of Practice. The Language Arts or the Literacy, I'm sorry the Mathematics has already

07:25:10.280 --> 07:25:16.280
begun but educators can join. The second session of the math will take place in October and the

07:25:16.280 --> 07:25:21.720
Literacy sessions will begin September 19th. I encourage everyone who may be interested please

07:25:21.720 --> 07:25:27.880
go to the website to get more information and lastly just wanted to lift up that the system

07:25:27.880 --> 07:25:32.760
of support which is another important component of our Accountability and Continuous Improvement

07:25:33.640 --> 07:25:43.240
System is also undergoing evaluation from the CCEE from the RTI group and again more information

07:25:43.240 --> 07:25:48.440
is available on the website. Thank you. Thank you. Member Lewis.

07:25:53.320 --> 07:25:58.600
Just want to give an update both Vice President Glover Woods and I are liaisons in the Structural

07:25:58.600 --> 07:26:03.960
Quality Commission so I'll just give the update for today. There hasn't been a meeting since our

07:26:03.960 --> 07:26:11.000
last SBE meeting so the next meeting for the IEQC will be next Wednesday and for anyone

07:26:11.000 --> 07:26:17.640
interested the agenda has already been posted. Last week there are two key agenda items for next

07:26:17.640 --> 07:26:26.120
week and the first is just a revision of the 2024 meeting dates and then the second item is

07:26:26.120 --> 07:26:32.360
proposed revised guidance for the local instructional materials adoptions. These were

07:26:32.360 --> 07:26:40.680
reviewed and modified by the IEQC at the March 2023 meeting. Also at next week's meeting the IEQC

07:26:40.680 --> 07:26:47.240
will review the edits and consider recommending the document to the SBE later on this fall.

07:26:47.240 --> 07:26:53.880
It will be an in-person meeting and it will be broadcast via the live stream. Also the other

07:26:53.880 --> 07:26:59.240
thing the other item and I think you mentioned this earlier there's some new member recruitment

07:26:59.240 --> 07:27:06.280
going on the SBE and the CDE are currently recruiting four new IEQC members along with

07:27:06.280 --> 07:27:13.560
one student member starting in 2024. We have four members who term out in December 31st and our

07:27:13.560 --> 07:27:24.840
student terms out in June of 2024 so that's it. You are all great role models. Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

07:27:28.040 --> 07:27:33.880
Thank you. I already reported a bit so I know that in the interest of time I just want to

07:27:34.520 --> 07:27:39.000
speak a little bit about the comprehensive redesign and reporting enhancements for the

07:27:39.000 --> 07:27:45.960
CASP and LPAC. Student score reports will have other significant benefits to teachers in the

07:27:45.960 --> 07:27:51.160
classroom in several ways. One of my key points is the professional development component the

07:27:51.880 --> 07:27:56.760
availability of resources such as the interim assessment fact sheets and user guides will

07:27:56.760 --> 07:28:02.280
support teachers in understanding and effectively using the new interim assessments. The professional

07:28:02.280 --> 07:28:07.000
learning opportunities and training modules will further equip educators with the knowledge

07:28:07.000 --> 07:28:12.600
and skills needed to leverage these assessments to enhance their classroom practices and overall

07:28:12.600 --> 07:28:18.120
the redesigned and reporting enhancements of the reports and LPAC assessments will empower

07:28:18.120 --> 07:28:23.080
educators and families with more clear more actionable and timely information.

07:28:23.800 --> 07:28:28.360
Information these changes will enhance their ability to provide effective instruction,

07:28:28.360 --> 07:28:33.320
track student progress, and make data-driven decisions that benefit their students academic

07:28:33.320 --> 07:28:41.000
growth and success. Thank you and in my exhaustion I skipped right past member McQuillin.

07:28:41.000 --> 07:28:49.320
M does come before O in the alphabet and also member Olken. So member McQuillin. I thought

07:28:49.320 --> 07:28:54.360
we were on a different alphabet there. We're on a different alphabet. After five it's all right.

07:28:54.360 --> 07:29:01.640
I'll be brief. My report is on the California state plan for career technical education.

07:29:01.640 --> 07:29:08.360
There's a new plan that's rolling out and to support that implementation the CDE and the

07:29:08.360 --> 07:29:14.040
chancellor's office from the community colleges are holding a series of meetings regional convenings

07:29:14.680 --> 07:29:21.640
over the next six weeks. Ten of these throughout California to really look regionally how those

07:29:21.640 --> 07:29:28.360
regions collaborate with the plan and bring bring those teams of people together on career

07:29:28.360 --> 07:29:37.160
technical education. Those meetings are starting next week. Also under the CTIG the California

07:29:37.160 --> 07:29:44.360
career technical technical education incentive grant round nine of those applications has gone

07:29:44.360 --> 07:29:50.840
out and they're due back September 29th and then they'll come before us for approval

07:29:50.840 --> 07:29:59.160
in our January 20 2024 meeting. The other part that's launching is the golden state pathways

07:29:59.160 --> 07:30:09.080
program. This 500 million dollar program is established to promote pathways in high wage,

07:30:09.080 --> 07:30:16.600
high skill, high growth areas and encourage collaborative between local agencies, higher

07:30:16.600 --> 07:30:22.760
education and employers allowing students to advance seamlessly from high school to higher

07:30:22.760 --> 07:30:33.320
ed and into their career in CTE various pathways. The program will have 10 service technical

07:30:33.320 --> 07:30:39.160
assistance centers up to 10 and that's being launched right now and the RFPs have gone out

07:30:39.160 --> 07:30:45.800
for that for 25 million and then LEAs can apply for that money later in the winter.

07:30:46.680 --> 07:30:56.760
Thank you. And member Olken. Thank you. I just want to report briefly on two projects that I'm

07:30:58.120 --> 07:31:05.000
the liaison for that because of summer had a lot going on they both are have educators who are

07:31:05.000 --> 07:31:09.800
doing a lot of the work and so they had some time not in the classroom. The first one is

07:31:10.680 --> 07:31:17.240
I'm the liaison for environmental literacy and specifically I was able to attend the California

07:31:17.240 --> 07:31:24.600
climate change and environmental justice program summer convening which was groups from across the

07:31:24.600 --> 07:31:32.200
state coming together to work on curriculum units in K through 12 that will address environmental

07:31:32.840 --> 07:31:40.200
justice and climate change in that will be available for teachers across the state

07:31:40.200 --> 07:31:43.640
and there's incredible convening and the work that they're doing is going to be

07:31:45.640 --> 07:31:49.880
really exciting for our students and for teachers because it's really good work.

07:31:51.000 --> 07:32:00.680
And then the second thing I'm involved in the statewide IEP template design project

07:32:01.560 --> 07:32:07.240
and we did a lot of work this summer trying to draft a new

07:32:08.440 --> 07:32:16.760
statewide IEP template that would really focus on student strengths and be really usable for

07:32:16.760 --> 07:32:23.080
teachers in the classroom and that work is speeding up with the hope of having

07:32:24.040 --> 07:32:30.680
a draft to start getting feedback on by late December or January. So those are my two big

07:32:30.680 --> 07:32:33.960
things for now. Thank you. Member Patilla Bronson.

07:32:36.840 --> 07:32:43.720
So one of my updates is around the universal pre-k mixed delivery quality and access work group

07:32:43.720 --> 07:32:49.720
which actually has met twice since our last board meeting. That group is tasked with providing

07:32:49.720 --> 07:32:57.560
recommendations on best practices and updates to preschools standards and it's the exciting moment

07:32:57.560 --> 07:33:05.080
where we've dug very deep on identifying barriers and this month's conversation begins conversation

07:33:05.080 --> 07:33:11.480
about solutions and the path forward so that's an exciting sort of next step for that group and the

07:33:11.480 --> 07:33:18.360
final report will be coming later this year and then finalized in March 2024. The other update I

07:33:18.360 --> 07:33:27.240
wanted to provide is that the prior conversation from the last meeting around school facilities,

07:33:27.240 --> 07:33:34.600
the school bond bills have been put over by the legislature to resume in the new year and so that

07:33:34.600 --> 07:33:39.480
work will continue. I think some of the conversation that I had raised previously around

07:33:40.040 --> 07:33:46.120
low income districts and property, low property value districts, I think that

07:33:47.320 --> 07:33:52.440
solution making will continue also in the new year. And then my last update is just a happy

07:33:53.880 --> 07:34:00.680
coda to the California Summer School for the Arts had a successful and full enrollment

07:34:00.680 --> 07:34:08.760
summer that wrapped up after our last board meeting over 400 students and for the first

07:34:08.760 --> 07:34:15.080
time over 50 percent of students who attended received financial aid which speaks to a

07:34:15.080 --> 07:34:23.480
socioeconomic mix that is the aspiration for the program. Thank you. Member Rodriguez.

07:34:25.160 --> 07:34:35.240
Thank you. I will also be brief. So I have three items to report. One is the CTC meeting that

07:34:35.800 --> 07:34:40.840
happened in August and two updates that I'll tell you about.

07:34:42.760 --> 07:34:50.680
The roadmap to educational careers initiative or the roadmap to teaching was showcased and

07:34:51.400 --> 07:34:57.160
if you have a chance, please visit the website roadmap to teaching on the CTC.

07:34:58.040 --> 07:35:04.760
You can search CTC roadmap to teaching. It's amazing and share it with anybody that may want

07:35:04.840 --> 07:35:11.480
to become a teacher. It is an educational career initiative and it was established by an assembly

07:35:11.480 --> 07:35:19.160
bill AB 178 with the goal of helping to guide and explain pathways for individuals interested

07:35:19.160 --> 07:35:24.520
in a career in education. The initiative is a direct response to the teacher shortage

07:35:24.520 --> 07:35:30.680
affecting all parts of California and bolsters the governor's ongoing efforts to support education

07:35:30.680 --> 07:35:41.000
in the state. So it's an amazing site. You can go in and say I'll be graduating from college and

07:35:41.000 --> 07:35:48.520
it will tell you where to go. So please visit. It was very exciting to see that shared. Also at

07:35:48.520 --> 07:35:57.880
the CTC meeting, LPI conducted an analysis of five years. So we had a study session. Five years of

07:35:57.880 --> 07:36:04.680
new educators perceptions that were captured in surveys that examined statewide patterns

07:36:05.800 --> 07:36:12.680
for the program completers. So when President Darling-Hammond and I were on the CTC in 2016,

07:36:14.600 --> 07:36:21.800
the commission approved program completer surveys. So a teacher goes through a teacher ed program,

07:36:21.800 --> 07:36:27.640
teacher prep program, and they complete a survey. The employer completes a survey.

07:36:28.600 --> 07:36:38.280
So this data, 60,000 surveys were analyzed and I will, if you get a chance, you can watch the

07:36:38.280 --> 07:36:44.520
meeting because there was information about teachers, about administrators that came out

07:36:44.520 --> 07:36:49.960
of programs and how they feel about their preparation. But to summarize, completers of

07:36:49.960 --> 07:36:55.640
educator prep and induction programs in California have positive perceptions of the

07:36:55.640 --> 07:37:02.840
program effectiveness and preparedness. Clinical experiences are critical and across all surveys,

07:37:02.840 --> 07:37:08.120
the intensity of clinical and personalized support is related to overall perceptions

07:37:08.120 --> 07:37:16.440
and preparedness. And this was the tougher news and I don't think it's surprising based on what

07:37:16.440 --> 07:37:22.680
we've seen. Not all educators have access to highly rated preparation experiences,

07:37:22.680 --> 07:37:27.720
especially while supporting clinical practice and personalized support. So that was one of

07:37:27.720 --> 07:37:35.800
the recommendations that the IPL, IP, I'm sorry, Learning Policy Institute. Stay away from acronyms.

07:37:36.920 --> 07:37:40.040
I keep thinking of LPL Financial. It's a building I drive by.

07:37:40.040 --> 07:37:49.480
Anyway, there were some policy recommendations, but especially to create parity among teacher

07:37:49.480 --> 07:37:54.360
preparation because we want to make sure that all students in California have the best prepared

07:37:54.360 --> 07:38:00.280
teachers and we know that the best prepared teachers are the ones that stay in the classroom

07:38:00.280 --> 07:38:07.720
because we have the agency and the efficacy to handle issues that we confront on a daily basis.

07:38:08.440 --> 07:38:16.360
As co-chair of the NASB PEP committee, we have completed our presentations,

07:38:16.360 --> 07:38:24.600
our reports, and we should be reporting to NASB in October and present it to the public there.

07:38:25.320 --> 07:38:35.480
And lastly, I assisted the MTSS conference in Anaheim after our last board meeting and I'm just

07:38:35.480 --> 07:38:41.000
so impressed with all of the great work that's happening in California. There's some California

07:38:41.000 --> 07:38:49.400
schools that were just really highlighted for all of their efforts to provide the best quality

07:38:49.400 --> 07:38:59.640
supports, thoughtful supports, and so many sessions that modeled great teaching, what our schools

07:38:59.640 --> 07:39:05.960
could be experiencing, and so I want to thank Jamie Parsons for the invitation and Rhonda

07:39:05.960 --> 07:39:14.920
Marriott for all that they taught me about MTSS. Thank you. Member Yoshimoto-Tari.

07:39:16.600 --> 07:39:22.280
Thank you. We spoke already today about civic learning, so I'm going to be extremely brief

07:39:22.280 --> 07:39:26.280
and say the State School of Civic Engagement website does have great resources on it,

07:39:26.280 --> 07:39:32.120
so I'd encourage everyone to look there. And in addition, in the 2022 state budget,

07:39:32.120 --> 07:39:39.640
the legislature appropriated five million dollars a year for CDE to expand opportunities for young

07:39:39.640 --> 07:39:45.640
people to participate in service learning. So those are great opportunities to expand

07:39:46.760 --> 07:39:51.480
high quality service learning for our young people and there's another grant cycle coming this fall

07:39:51.480 --> 07:39:58.840
and this winter for those interested in applying for those dollars to do so. Secondly,

07:39:58.840 --> 07:40:03.960
our advisory commission on special education has completed their end of year report,

07:40:03.960 --> 07:40:09.160
so I'm just going to ask all of my fellow colleagues to look for that that will be sent to us.

07:40:09.160 --> 07:40:14.440
Shortly, it's available online, but it will be sent to our emails. That report is meant to advise

07:40:14.440 --> 07:40:21.240
us, the state board, the legislature, the governor's office, and the CDE regarding all matters related

07:40:21.240 --> 07:40:26.920
to special education. So there's information about mental health, the policy subcommittee,

07:40:27.720 --> 07:40:33.240
including a section on the annual progress report, which we see usually typically in January.

07:40:33.800 --> 07:40:37.400
So please look for that. And then finally, for community schools program,

07:40:38.520 --> 07:40:42.120
I just wanted to say that our grantees will soon have an annual progress report

07:40:42.760 --> 07:40:48.680
to reflect on and submit, and the State Transformation Assistance Center has gotten

07:40:48.680 --> 07:40:54.440
a lot of feedback and multiple iterations of feedback in order to make that really meaningful,

07:40:54.440 --> 07:41:00.280
a meaningful experience for our grantees in the California Community Schools Partnership Program.

07:41:00.280 --> 07:41:03.960
So that will be something to look forward to. Thank you very much.

07:41:03.960 --> 07:41:09.160
Thank you. And all of the things I was involved with have been reported on in this meeting.

07:41:10.840 --> 07:41:17.560
I am now going to take up the last agenda item, 11, general public comment. Public comment is

07:41:17.560 --> 07:41:22.760
invited on any matter not included in the printed agenda and members of the public wishing to provide

07:41:22.760 --> 07:41:29.960
comment on this item may do so in person or by calling the number shown on the public comment

07:41:29.960 --> 07:41:36.200
slide. There it is. Are there any speakers signed up to provide public comment in person?

07:41:36.760 --> 07:41:42.680
Yes, we have one speaker signed up for in person, Lisa Ostertag. If you can please come up to the

07:41:42.680 --> 07:41:48.600
microphone, state your name and affiliation for the record, please. Good evening, board. My name

07:41:48.600 --> 07:41:53.240
is Lisa Ostertag and I'm the Assistant Director at Cabrillo Point Academy. We have experienced a

07:41:53.240 --> 07:41:58.360
significant amount of complaints from one family in the last two years and are experiencing challenges

07:41:58.360 --> 07:42:03.480
with the CDE's corrective action. While we appreciate the investigative process and understand

07:42:03.480 --> 07:42:07.640
that it is an important component of protecting parents' procedural safeguards, we are growing

07:42:07.640 --> 07:42:13.000
more concerned with the contradictory guidance that we receive from CDE. When the same family

07:42:13.000 --> 07:42:18.600
continues to file the same complaints to the CDE and the CDE issues contradictory findings,

07:42:18.600 --> 07:42:23.080
it becomes difficult for us to comply with the corrective actions. In a good faith effort to

07:42:23.080 --> 07:42:27.640
align with the CDE, we want to ensure that there is a fair process. Specifically, we would like

07:42:27.640 --> 07:42:33.320
these considerations. Contradictory findings may indicate there was not a thorough and comprehensive

07:42:33.320 --> 07:42:38.920
investigation conducted. Evidence provided by the LEA should be appropriately considered and given

07:42:38.920 --> 07:42:43.880
due weight. Specifically, if parents are interviewed and allowed to provide testimonial evidence,

07:42:43.880 --> 07:42:48.600
the LEA should be afforded the same opportunity. When findings are issued, the guidance should be

07:42:48.600 --> 07:42:53.480
clear and not require the LEA to make inferences as to how to move forward since there's no

07:42:53.480 --> 07:42:58.200
mechanism provided to gather additional information regarding corrective actions or findings.

07:42:58.200 --> 07:43:05.400
Time. Thank you. Thank you very much. And are there any public commenters in the queue on the

07:43:05.400 --> 07:43:14.440
phone? There are no callers in the queue. All right. That means that we are now ready to adjourn

07:43:14.440 --> 07:43:23.400
the September 2023 State Board of Education meeting at 541 p.m. Thank you very much.

07:43:28.200 --> 07:43:28.700
Thank you.
