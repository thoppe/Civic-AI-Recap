WEBVTT

00:00.884 --> 00:05.562
The State Board will reconvene for the second day of our meeting.

00:07.449 --> 00:18.032
I would like to report out that the in closed session, the board discussed or took action on the following case, Kapim versus Torlakson et al.

00:18.992 --> 00:29.935
And before we begin the public hearing and before we begin the whole proceeding with the department presentation, I'd like to get the two action items left that we must take up.

00:30.995 --> 00:31.835
These are in item 17.

00:33.416 --> 00:45.399
One is the under SBE priorities and one would be the approval of our minutes and the other would be the approval of our ACSS new members for the Advisory Commission on Charter School.

00:50.480 --> 00:51.420
And CPEG.

00:52.781 --> 00:53.261
So, yeah.

00:55.685 --> 00:56.605
Thank you, President Kirst.

00:56.665 --> 01:00.207
I'd be happy to make a motion to approve the minutes if you'd like to get that out of the way.

01:00.227 --> 01:00.767
Yes, I would.

01:01.187 --> 01:01.507
Second.

01:03.128 --> 01:05.268
Is there any discussion by the board?

01:05.549 --> 01:05.749
No?

01:07.669 --> 01:08.930
No public comment on that?

01:09.650 --> 01:10.970
All those in favor, raise your hands.

01:12.051 --> 01:12.331
Okay.

01:13.969 --> 01:17.311
So the next item is you have an addendum item 17.

01:17.451 --> 01:24.556
And these are recommendations from the screening committee for appointments and reappointments to our various advisory committees.

01:25.457 --> 01:34.963
Before I begin, I just want to say that again, as I mentioned yesterday with respect to the student recruitment, very strong applicant pool, lots of interest in serving.

01:35.424 --> 01:37.445
So very much appreciative of that.

01:38.065 --> 01:41.548
And it's gratifying that there's the level of civic engagement that we have.

01:42.428 --> 01:45.991
So I'm going to...member's son is gone.

01:46.091 --> 01:48.713
She had to recuse for ACCS.

01:49.213 --> 01:53.876
I'm just going to read these quickly because not everybody who's streaming will have this document.

01:54.737 --> 01:57.419
We recruited for three committees.

01:57.939 --> 02:08.807
With respect to the ACCS, I want to express my appreciation to board member Williams and our staff, Carolyn Pfister and Cindy Chan, who actually came back from retirement to help us with this.

02:09.507 --> 02:12.650
And these are our recommendations for appointment and reappointment.

02:13.431 --> 02:18.436
To represent the parent on the ACCS, we're recommending Jared Austin.

02:18.716 --> 02:23.921
He's the executive director of Kairos Public School in the Vacaville area.

02:24.682 --> 02:28.426
We're also recommending reappointment of the following individuals.

02:28.766 --> 02:32.689
Ari Engelberg, who will serve in an at-large position.

02:33.209 --> 02:35.691
He's the executive director of Bright Star Schools.

02:36.211 --> 02:43.837
Mark Ryan, who's the superintendent of North Valley Military Institute in the Los Angeles area, will represent charter school administrators.

02:44.437 --> 02:51.903
And Wes Seaver, who's the superintendent of Kingsburg Elementary Charter School District, will represent district superintendents.

02:53.044 --> 02:55.065
So that's the ACCS.

02:55.105 --> 02:57.647
And I'm going to just ask for a motion on all of these at the end.

03:00.932 --> 03:01.572
Oh, sorry.

03:03.554 --> 03:04.614
Okay, I take that back.

03:04.835 --> 03:09.678
I move that we approve the appointment and reappointment of the members to the ACCS.

03:09.698 --> 03:10.579
Second.

03:11.960 --> 03:13.301
All those in favor, respond.

03:14.381 --> 03:15.142
Okay, thank you.

03:16.764 --> 03:21.507
While Ting is coming back in, I'm going to tell you about the California Practitioner Advisory Group.

03:22.347 --> 03:28.090
We're recommending appointment of three individuals for three-year terms, starting with Nancy Portillo.

03:28.931 --> 03:32.833
Nancy is the Assistant Superintendent in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.

03:32.913 --> 03:35.054
She's representing private school children.

03:35.795 --> 03:39.917
Tarina Small, who's a teacher at Sciatech in the San Diego area.

03:40.397 --> 03:42.639
She's representing teachers from charter schools.

03:43.199 --> 03:49.183
And Jesse Levin, who's a principal researcher for AIR, and he's representing educational researchers.

03:49.904 --> 03:53.366
We're also recommending the reappointment of Joanne Ishkin.

03:53.847 --> 03:57.830
Joanne is the interim director at UCLA's teacher education program.

03:58.550 --> 04:01.612
She's also representing educational researchers.

04:04.794 --> 04:05.695
So that's CPAP.

04:05.755 --> 04:06.816
Can we have a motion on that?

04:10.436 --> 04:11.856
I'm going.

04:12.296 --> 04:21.378
We're also recommending the reappointment of Edmon Ansalo, who's the county superintendent, Eldorado County, who's representing superintendents.

04:21.478 --> 04:27.619
Karen Monroe, the superintendent, Alameda County, who's representing authorizers of charter schools.

04:28.079 --> 04:36.401
And Araceli Simeon, who's a parent organization network project director for Asian Americans Advancing Justice.

04:36.441 --> 04:37.761
She's representing parents.

04:38.701 --> 04:41.406
of students currently enrolled in K-12 schools.

04:41.486 --> 04:42.548
So that's CPAG.

04:42.628 --> 04:45.173
We can do CPAG and IQC together.

04:45.193 --> 04:51.664
The next group is for recommendations for appointment to the Instructional Quality Commission.

04:52.600 --> 04:53.760
for a four-year term.

04:54.501 --> 05:03.144
And thanks to my colleagues on the screening committee, Feliza Ortiz-Lincoln and Eileen Strauss, as well as Stephanie and her staff.

05:04.464 --> 05:06.945
First recommendation is Shay Fairchild.

05:07.085 --> 05:10.426
Shay is a curriculum specialist in Norwalk La Mirada.

05:11.066 --> 05:15.608
She will be representing the expertise area of elementary education.

05:16.268 --> 05:22.090
Jose Lara, who's a social studies teacher in LA Unified, he's going to help us on ethnic studies.

05:22.691 --> 05:26.432
Christine Chapman is a principal of Delano Union School District.

05:26.592 --> 05:28.153
She will help with mathematics.

05:30.242 --> 05:36.849
And we're recommending also Yolanda Munoz, who's a teacher in Pasadena Unified.

05:36.969 --> 05:38.851
She'll help us on special education.

05:39.532 --> 05:47.700
And we are also going to recommend an appointment now for beginning January 1, 2019 of Deborah Costa Hernandez.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.783
She's the executive director of the

05:50.643 --> 06:00.430
subject matter project at the University of California and she's going to be representing elementary education and I move appointments and reappointments to those two committees.

06:00.450 --> 06:03.333
Any discussion by the board?

06:03.353 --> 06:05.274
If not, raise your hand.

06:06.595 --> 06:10.318
Okay, that completes that action part of that item.

06:10.358 --> 06:10.738
We still

06:11.391 --> 06:17.074
I have the board member comments about developments in their various activities.

06:17.754 --> 06:21.035
So now I'm ready for us to take up item 18.

06:21.616 --> 06:25.618
History, Social Studies Adoption of K-8 Instructional Materials.

06:26.298 --> 06:28.999
Instructional Quality Commission Recommendations.

06:29.880 --> 06:32.641
This is an action item and has a public hearing.

06:33.425 --> 06:38.049
So we're going to start with the CDE presenter, Stephanie Gregson.

06:38.710 --> 06:43.154
Then we're going to have the guest presenters from the IQC.

06:44.115 --> 06:53.383
We think it's important that SBE members hold their questions both technical and substantive until after the public comment in its entirety.

06:54.944 --> 06:57.546
And so why don't we begin with Stephanie.

07:00.970 --> 07:01.991
Good morning, everyone.

07:02.011 --> 07:06.695
Good morning, Board President Kirsch, Superintendent Torlakson, and honorable members of the board.

07:07.156 --> 07:08.256
My name is Stephanie Gregson.

07:08.317 --> 07:14.182
I have the pleasure of serving as the Executive Director of the Instructional Quality Commission, and I'd like to thank you for spending the day with us today.

07:15.834 --> 07:33.777
Before I begin introductions and the formal presentation, I'd like to acknowledge and appreciate the many participants in this process, including my staff at the Department of Education, the 99 instructional materials reviewers and content review experts, the commissioners, and the many people and groups who participated throughout this process.

07:34.418 --> 07:45.051
As we know, history social science is an inquiry-based discipline that relies on reason, debate, and evidence to support positions with the goal of a greater civic understanding.

07:45.552 --> 07:52.320
This, in part, explains the passionate participation and debate about instructional materials for California's classrooms.

07:52.981 --> 08:07.057
With this understanding, let me share with you the extensive review process that the Instructional Quality Commission, instructional material reviewers, and content reviewer experts engaged in to ensure high quality instructional materials for our students.

08:07.998 --> 08:21.527
To help me present this process and recommendations of the Instructional Quality Commission, I have with me Bill Honig, Chair of the History Social Science Subject Matter Committee of the Instructional Quality Commission, and Lizette Diaz, Chair of the Instructional Quality Commission.

08:22.408 --> 08:31.153
Commissioner Honig will briefly review the instructional shifts from the History Social Science Framework that are represented in the instructional materials recommended by the IQC.

08:32.054 --> 08:35.843
Chair Diaz will then present the recommendations of the Instructional Quality Commission.

08:36.204 --> 08:40.314
But first, I get to walk you through the process that has brought us in front of you today.

08:43.587 --> 08:51.055
The adoption process is a lengthy one with many steps that are defined in statute and in the California Code of Regulations.

08:51.536 --> 08:55.620
Here is an overview of the major milestones that have brought us to this meeting today.

08:56.381 --> 09:04.089
In some ways, this process began in July of 2016 when the State Board of Education adopted the new history social science framework.

09:04.730 --> 09:17.175
The new curriculum framework has been the basis for this adoption, both because of the new content and instructional shifts throughout the document and the fact that the evaluation criteria used for this adoption is part of the framework.

09:17.895 --> 09:23.097
At the same meeting, the board approved the schedule of significant events and the reviewer application for the adoption.

09:23.957 --> 09:30.338
After the framework was adopted, the CDE conducted initial briefings of publishers in participating in the adoption.

09:30.998 --> 09:41.080
These briefings took place in July and September of 2016 and focused on the content of the new curriculum framework and how the instructional shifts would translate into instructional materials.

09:41.840 --> 09:50.182
In January of this year, the state board appointed instructional material reviewers and content review experts that were recommended by the Instructional Quality Commission.

09:50.882 --> 09:55.083
The board also approved two non-commissioners to serve as review panel facilitators.

09:55.864 --> 10:09.168
On January 18, 2017, the California Department of Education hosted the publisher's invitation to submit meeting where the statutory and regulatory requirements for participation in the adoption process were explained.

10:09.548 --> 10:12.729
This meeting was open to the public and invited public comment.

10:14.997 --> 10:22.182
Title V regulations require a majority of instructional material reviewers be classroom teachers in the area of history social science.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.904
I think that's a great benefit to our process.

10:24.984 --> 10:31.208
The board appointed 73 classroom teachers out of a total of 99 reviewers for 10 panels.

10:32.029 --> 10:38.934
Per the Title V regulations, each panel had a board-appointed content review expert with a doctoral degree in the area of history social science.

10:39.454 --> 10:44.178
The panels also included board-appointed curriculum leaders and community members.

10:45.038 --> 10:52.233
All reviewers received a week-long training at the lovely Doubletree in Sacramento from April 24th through 28th.

10:52.393 --> 10:53.976
Their chocolate chip cookies were the best.

10:55.356 --> 11:04.582
The board-appointed reviewers were trained to evaluate the submitted programs for alignment with the standards, framework, and evaluation criteria adopted by the board.

11:05.162 --> 11:09.104
Reviewers had the privilege of being sworn in by Board Member Rucker.

11:09.925 --> 11:15.888
On the final day of the training, reviewers attended presentations by the publishers of the programs that they were assigned to review.

11:16.409 --> 11:21.152
The reviewer training was an open meeting, and public comment was called for each day of the training.

11:22.233 --> 11:30.398
During the summer following the training, each reviewer conducted an independent and extensive review of the instructional materials assigned to his or her panel.

11:30.879 --> 11:42.667
This independent review was conducted over a two-month period of time, with each reviewer spending hundreds of hours reviewing the text for alignment to the standards, framework, and evaluation criteria.

11:43.087 --> 11:49.011
As a former reviewer, I can appreciate the time and the table space they took to conduct their review.

11:51.178 --> 11:57.041
Reviewer deliberations were held again at the Sacramento Doubletree on July 24 through 28.

11:57.662 --> 12:06.507
During the deliberations, the reviewers met in panels to discuss and evaluate the 12 programs submitted for the 2017 History Social Science Adoption.

12:07.067 --> 12:13.090
The panels were forwarded any public comment related to their program to review prior to deliberations.

12:13.711 --> 12:17.133
During deliberations, panels took public comment twice each day.

12:17.953 --> 12:25.336
After much discussion and reaching consensus on their recommendations, the panel members developed a report of findings for each program.

12:25.836 --> 12:30.437
These reports were forwarded to the commission and were also posted on the CDE website.

12:30.958 --> 12:35.399
We thank board member Rucker and Sandoval for their presence during deliberations.

12:35.519 --> 12:40.381
They witnessed the panel's process and discussions as they conducted their deliberations.

12:41.181 --> 12:46.844
The commission hosted a public meeting on August 17th to receive public comment on the report of findings.

12:47.384 --> 12:53.287
As you know, the CDE and the commission have received extensive public comment throughout the adoption process.

12:53.808 --> 13:00.331
Between the various meetings, hearings, and submissions via email and regular email, we have received over 10,000 pages as of November 6th.

13:04.253 --> 13:05.294
of public testimony.

13:05.734 --> 13:13.377
All of this comment has been archived on the cdebox.com account and has been made available to board members for their review.

13:14.518 --> 13:25.423
On September 27th through 28th, 2017, the members of the Instructional Quality Commission considered the recommendations from the Instructional Material Reviewers and Content Review Expert Report of Findings.

13:26.303 --> 13:37.149
their public comments, and reports from individual commissioners to determine whether each program satisfied or did not satisfy the State of Board Adopted Evaluation Criteria for this adoption.

13:37.909 --> 13:48.915
Prior to action, the IQC conducted two public hearings, one during the History-Social Science Subject Matter Committee on September 27th, and one during the full IQC meeting on September 28th.

13:49.636 --> 13:54.579
The commissioners heard testimony from 199 members of the public at these two meetings.

13:55.399 --> 14:04.385
Commissioner Hoening will now briefly describe the instructional shifts from the history social science framework that are presented in the instructional materials recommended by the IQC.

14:11.130 --> 14:11.730
Good morning.

14:14.152 --> 14:19.855
President Kerr, Superintendent Torlakson, Executive Director Steph Walters, members of the board.

14:21.127 --> 14:32.750
I'm just going to briefly go over what the framework and standards and especially the framework said about these changes which are now reflected in the textbooks that are before you for adoption.

14:34.090 --> 14:43.312
There are four instructional shifts that lay out the expectations for how history social science is taught in California and expressed within the new instructional materials.

14:44.059 --> 14:52.753
The content in the books was significantly expanded to reflect new scholarship and developments that have taken place.

14:53.214 --> 14:58.342
This translates into instructional materials expanding the diversity reflected in the historical narrative.

14:59.185 --> 15:07.656
and is consistent with some of the legislation that was passed in the legislature directing our work.

15:08.737 --> 15:15.366
The second major point is that the frameworks and structural model is based upon the concept of student inquiry.

15:16.648 --> 15:21.392
Board member Rucker made this point early in the process about we want a more active classroom.

15:21.673 --> 15:22.894
We want to pose questions.

15:22.934 --> 15:28.579
We want to have students talk to each other and discuss issues, not just a lecture format.

15:28.960 --> 15:33.164
And that's in the framework and reflected in the materials that will be before you.

15:33.940 --> 15:46.965
So it's not just something, this is not something entirely new for most history social science teachers, but the instructional materials will now support the inquiry concept with suggestions for student-based learning and guiding questions that students can answer.

15:47.685 --> 15:56.649
The third element is we know that literacy development is a shared enterprise and the framework emphasizes the importance of collaboration to develop student literacy skills.

15:57.089 --> 16:12.454
The framework contained more than 30 detailed lesson examples that provide correlations to not only the California History Social Science Content Standards and Analysis Skills, but also the California Common Core ELA Standards and the California ELD Standards.

16:12.854 --> 16:21.617
The instructional materials demonstrate and emphasize literacy development by incorporating the concept of classroom examples within the instructional materials.

16:22.238 --> 16:22.898
And finally,

16:23.848 --> 16:29.191
One of the things we're proud of is the framework emphasizes citizenship and civics.

16:29.651 --> 16:31.132
And these materials do too.

16:31.192 --> 16:32.593
That's the fourth element here.

16:33.153 --> 16:39.477
Given our current discussion of where we are in the country, that's a very important thing to do with our youngsters.

16:40.138 --> 16:45.401
And it's strongly emphasized in the framework, both in the framework and in the appendices.

16:46.081 --> 16:50.784
And it means the instructional materials now not only support students learning about how government works,

16:51.257 --> 16:58.782
but encourages teachers to provide opportunities to students to practice the skills and habits of engaged and active citizens.

16:59.863 --> 17:16.074
The new History, Social Science, and Structural Materials being recommended today include these four shifts throughout the grade levels and provide opportunities for students to engage in conducting their own analysis of history and connect the narrative of history to today's events.

17:16.535 --> 17:19.357
Students will have the opportunity to become historians themselves.

17:20.117 --> 17:29.038
I'd now like to introduce Lizette Diaz, who's chair of the Instructional Quality Commission, to make the recommendations about which materials are supported.

17:37.523 --> 17:39.004
Thank you, Commissioner Hoening.

17:39.044 --> 17:39.504
Good morning.

17:39.524 --> 17:45.807
I have the pleasure of presenting information on the recommendations of the Instructional Quality Commission.

17:46.347 --> 17:53.790
As chair of the Instructional Quality Commission, I would be remiss if I did not mention the appreciation of the commission

17:54.190 --> 17:59.854
for the participation of the members of the public in providing their input on the instructional materials.

18:00.375 --> 18:06.159
The commission took this role to heart and conducted their review with the utmost diligence.

18:06.820 --> 18:13.505
The recommendations of the commission are in the IQC advisory report, which was provided as an attachment to this item.

18:14.245 --> 18:19.686
The Commission is recommending 10 of the 12 programs submitted for this adoption.

18:20.167 --> 18:33.110
The IQC advisory includes our reasons for recommending or not recommending each program with citations in each of the five categories of the State Board adopted criteria.

18:33.810 --> 18:42.396
It lists recommended edits, corrections, including social content citations, publisher-submitted errata for each program.

18:42.916 --> 18:51.162
It is our recommendation that these proposed edits be considered as a condition for adoption if the state board elects to adopt these materials.

18:51.742 --> 19:00.348
The recommended edits came from a combination of the reports of the panels of the reviewers that the board appointed to evaluate the materials, comments,

19:00.808 --> 19:06.813
from the public that requested that edits be made to the materials and errata submitted by the publishers.

19:07.774 --> 19:17.843
The commissioners carefully considered all of these sources of input when discussing and deciding which edits to add to our recommendation.

19:22.105 --> 19:27.346
As I noted, the commission decided to recommend 10 of the 12 programs to the State Board of Education.

19:27.786 --> 19:33.688
The commission is not recommending two programs submitted by Houghton Mifflin Hardcourt Publishing Company.

19:34.188 --> 19:37.928
The reasons for this negative recommendation are included in our report.

19:38.349 --> 19:49.691
But in short, the commission felt that these programs did not meet the several criteria statements in Category 1, and in general, had issues that would require edits in excess.

19:50.131 --> 19:55.574
of the minimal in number threshold that is defined in the Title V regulations.

19:56.315 --> 20:07.621
It is our view that the fixes that would be needed to correct these issues would be rewrites and are disallowable as part of our process.

20:08.301 --> 20:14.563
If you adopt our recommendation, then you will be adopting only four programs for kindergarten through grade five.

20:15.123 --> 20:36.128
Therefore, in order to meet the requirement in Ed Code section 60200E, the state board must find that fewer than five programs meet the criteria for adoption and conduct a review of the degree to which the criteria and procedures for evaluation were consistent with the board adopted curriculum framework.

20:37.268 --> 20:53.906
Liaisons from the board were present at all meetings of the IQC related to this adoption and at the training and deliberations of reviews and can attest to the extent to which this process was aligned to the state board adopted framework.

20:54.486 --> 21:01.949
We know that you have to conduct a public hearing before you take action on this adoption and that there are many people waiting to speak.

21:02.369 --> 21:08.031
But on behalf of the commission, I would like to thank the board for its support throughout this adoption process.

21:08.471 --> 21:22.896
We hope that the materials you adopt today will provide, most importantly, support for districts across the state in implementing the instructional shifts and the new content in the history social science framework.

21:26.044 --> 21:28.445
And now I'd like to refer back to Dr. Grayson.

21:31.266 --> 21:32.167
Thank you, Chair Diaz.

21:32.647 --> 21:38.510
There have been many questions of what will happen after the State Board takes action today, so I'd like to provide some insight on that.

21:39.110 --> 21:47.534
Once the State Board takes action today, there's a 60-day timeline for publishers to submit all edits and corrections to be verified by CDE.

21:48.334 --> 21:58.402
I'd like to note that the materials seen linked at the California Department of Education website do not reflect any of the edits or corrections recommended by the IQC.

21:58.862 --> 22:03.366
They are in the original format that the reviewers use to conduct their review.

22:03.906 --> 22:10.311
The final versions of instructional materials will not be available until the State Board adopted edits and corrections have been made.

22:11.152 --> 22:24.236
I'd like to also highlight that besides the wonderful diversity of California, another beautiful element of California is the local control our local school districts have to make choices that are in the best interest of their students and community.

22:24.776 --> 22:27.978
These choices also apply to adopting instructional materials.

22:28.458 --> 22:35.060
The California process is designed to offer districts choices of instructional materials to match the needs of their students.

22:35.680 --> 22:39.884
Not all instructional materials are alike, and that is a benefit for our districts.

22:40.484 --> 22:50.493
Each district will have multiple options as they conduct their own review of instructional materials that are either on the state board adopted list or not on the state board adopted list.

22:50.973 --> 23:02.903
The state level review is just a first level review to share with districts, these are the materials that meet the criteria of the standards framework and criteria, the content of the standards framework and criteria.

23:03.644 --> 23:12.210
Districts then engage in their own review of instructional materials to analyze which programs best fit their student, program, and pedagogical needs.

23:12.751 --> 23:17.374
As a former principal and district administrator, this choice is invaluable for teachers and students.

23:17.834 --> 23:27.101
I have personally experienced the benefit of teachers being able to go through an analysis process of many programs to choose the one that best fits their students' needs.

23:29.085 --> 23:34.770
On this slide, we have provided the CDE recommendation based on the Instructional Quality Commission's recommendation.

23:35.310 --> 23:46.219
As Chair Diaz stated, we appreciate your support throughout this process and would be happy to answer any questions that you might have about the adoption process or the Commission recommendation after our public comment.

23:46.799 --> 23:47.180
Thank you.

23:47.960 --> 23:48.821
Thank you.

23:49.241 --> 23:52.163
So before we start the public hearing, I want to salute

23:53.274 --> 24:02.161
The outgoing member of the IQC, Bill Honig, who has served his two terms on this Instructional Quality Commission.

24:02.301 --> 24:07.205
He was the head of it and then has played a key role after that.

24:07.946 --> 24:12.590
Indefatigable in his work and in all the detail.

24:13.851 --> 24:17.594
Certainly a huge undertaking that he has led.

24:18.335 --> 24:21.237
And we're most appreciative of your time, your effort.

24:22.210 --> 24:25.052
the extensive experience you have in this.

24:26.013 --> 24:28.255
I remember working on this with you in 1976.

24:28.795 --> 24:32.338
So that goes back quite a ways.

24:32.458 --> 24:38.643
So we really salute your effort and integrity and help on this.

24:38.723 --> 24:39.704
So thank you.

24:42.025 --> 24:47.209
And so now I'm going to declare the public hearing open.

24:48.530 --> 24:49.972
I want to announce that

24:51.744 --> 24:57.089
We expect all participants of this public hearing to abide by their time limits.

24:57.290 --> 25:00.032
And the time limits are two minutes per publisher.

25:00.092 --> 25:01.874
We're going to start with the publishers.

25:03.836 --> 25:10.803
And then we're going to allow one minute per person for all the other members of the public.

25:11.324 --> 25:13.406
We hope that the public hearing

25:14.902 --> 25:23.909
Appearance will abide by their time limits and be respectful of all commenters and refrain from clapping, cheering or making other loud expressions.

25:24.470 --> 25:29.154
We want to make sure that the board and the audience are able to hear from all the commenters.

25:29.815 --> 25:37.642
So with that, I declare the public hearing open and we'll now call for the publishers to come.

25:37.742 --> 25:38.702
I guess we have a list.

25:38.722 --> 25:39.223
Go ahead.

25:39.935 --> 25:41.937
Yes, there are two.

25:42.798 --> 25:45.280
Roderick Spellman and Natasha Martin.

25:56.811 --> 25:58.053
My name is Roderick Spellman.

25:58.193 --> 26:01.696
I am the chief of the humanities department for Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.

26:01.736 --> 26:03.118
And first of all, I want to thank you for.

26:06.069 --> 26:06.609
The mic's on?

26:07.009 --> 26:07.289
Yes.

26:07.770 --> 26:08.830
I think yours is on.

26:09.050 --> 26:12.972
Wait a second.

26:13.012 --> 26:13.952
They're on, aren't they?

26:13.972 --> 26:19.034
Yeah, she's going to.

26:19.154 --> 26:19.534
Oh, got it.

26:19.554 --> 26:21.075
Is that better?

26:21.874 --> 26:22.595
Yes, go ahead.

26:22.635 --> 26:23.235
Speak loudly.

26:23.695 --> 26:24.096
Good morning.

26:24.136 --> 26:25.317
My name is Roderick Spellman.

26:25.437 --> 26:28.479
I am the head of the Humanities Department at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.

26:29.100 --> 26:31.241
I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak today.

26:31.261 --> 26:32.522
I appreciate it.

26:32.563 --> 26:33.643
I know it's a busy agenda.

26:34.144 --> 26:42.691
I first want to address some of the concerns that were raised by both the IQC and the community at large regarding our HMH social studies submissions.

26:43.651 --> 26:45.912
We take those concerns very, very seriously.

26:46.313 --> 26:56.137
We have worked diligently through these past months to address those concerns and to be sure that our materials reflect the kinds of changes that were directed by both the panels and special groups in the public.

26:57.198 --> 27:04.602
I think one of the biggest issues that was raised by the IQC was the issue around our grades 6, 7, and 8 errata corrections and the volume.

27:05.442 --> 27:06.963
We take responsibility for that.

27:07.083 --> 27:16.366
I think what we submitted there really focused on changes to our index, changes to our TOC, the kinds of page reference changes that really do not affect student content.

27:16.866 --> 27:22.148
I want to assure this board that in no way do those changes represent a rewrite of the content.

27:23.088 --> 27:29.154
We really focused exclusively on trying to clean up the files and really do those minor corrections and that's what that errata represents.

27:29.735 --> 27:34.600
I'd like to start with grade 6 and ask this board to approve that title for these reasons.

27:35.160 --> 27:38.244
It was approved by both the panel and the subject matter committee.

27:38.924 --> 27:41.207
It had less than 1% change to the content.

27:41.367 --> 27:43.809
There were no social content citations for grade 6.

27:44.977 --> 27:47.699
For grade 7, similar situation.

27:48.399 --> 27:56.264
We had no social content citations, less than 1% change, and both the panel and the subject matter committee approved grade 7.

27:57.144 --> 28:04.049
Grade 8, I would like to ask that you approve grade 8 because it also had less than 2% change to the actual content.

28:04.509 --> 28:06.770
It had only two social content citations.

28:07.271 --> 28:13.695
It was approved by the panel, the folks who actually looked through that content over those extensive hundreds of hours that Stephanie mentioned.

28:14.355 --> 28:17.137
and also by the Subject Matter Committee.

28:17.878 --> 28:28.747
So when you put that together, I really would ask you to consider the good faith that we work with, with our family coalition, the Hindu American Foundation, to ensure that these materials met the quality you expected.

28:28.767 --> 28:34.793
I thank you for your consideration and I would ask that you approve grades 6, 7, and 8 Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.

28:36.494 --> 28:37.055
Any questions?

28:39.336 --> 28:39.837
Okay, thank you.

28:49.875 --> 28:50.336
Good morning.

28:50.456 --> 28:55.102
My name is Natasha Martin, and I'm Outreach Director at Teachers Curriculum Institute.

28:55.643 --> 29:05.776
Teachers Curriculum Institute, or TCI, is a California-based company that was founded in 1989 with a mission to reach all learners through an active, hands-on approach to social studies.

29:06.497 --> 29:12.544
Our belief is that the best instructional materials combine high quality content and strong pedagogy.

29:13.185 --> 29:22.575
Because of this approach, TCI fully supports the vision of the history social science framework, and we have appreciated the opportunity to participate in the history social science adoption.

29:23.476 --> 29:41.467
We would like to make it clear to the Board that TCI will work with the Board and CDE staff to make any edits and corrections that are recommended by the State Board for the two programs that we have submitted, the Social Studies Alive California series for K-5 and the History Alive California series for K-6-8.

29:43.288 --> 29:48.211
Finally, we'd like to direct the board to public comment that was submitted by TCI on November 2nd.

29:48.911 --> 29:56.655
In this letter, we are suggesting two minor edits to resolve issues that resulted from edits that were approved in the final IQC approved motion.

29:57.336 --> 30:02.618
One suggested edit resolves a minor grammatical error created by one of the approved edits.

30:03.399 --> 30:07.401
The other edit seeks to resolve a small contradiction between two of the approved edits.

30:08.222 --> 30:12.644
I'll resubmit this letter to you today, and I thank you for your time and consideration.

30:16.550 --> 30:17.151
Okay, thank you.

30:17.171 --> 30:20.274
I think that concludes the publisher's comments.

30:20.294 --> 30:23.297
So now we're ready for public comments of one minute each.

30:24.938 --> 30:33.187
So we would like to ask numbers 1 through 24 to enter the boardroom in a single file line and be prepared to speak.

30:36.490 --> 30:39.213
Yeah, come right up and start speaking.

30:40.307 --> 30:41.488
Can we have some more people?

30:41.669 --> 30:41.909
Yeah.

30:42.890 --> 30:43.611
Go ahead, sir.

30:44.091 --> 30:46.274
Good morning.

30:46.875 --> 30:51.560
My name is Dr. Parag Vaishampine, and I work as a scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

30:52.281 --> 30:56.426
I thank and fully support IQC's decision to reject

30:57.326 --> 31:01.550
HMH K-6 and HMH 6-8 program.

31:02.370 --> 31:10.877
I strongly support the recommendations of Academic Coalition by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other top academicians.

31:11.658 --> 31:19.684
McGraw-Hill also has a lot of prejudice and racist contents, so does National Geography's World History of California textbook.

31:20.845 --> 31:30.167
There are many glaring problems in this textbook, including insensitive depiction of sacred Hindu text, which betrays the oriental stereotypes.

31:31.007 --> 31:38.049
The violations in the California law are also the criteria for instruction materials as mandated by CDE.

31:38.649 --> 31:48.511
Hence, it is imperative that these problems be addressed, failing which the textbook not be adopted for teaching in California public school.

31:48.971 --> 31:49.651
Thank you for your time.

31:56.798 --> 31:58.760
Good morning, chair and board members.

31:59.480 --> 32:00.261
I'm C.C.

32:00.301 --> 32:07.326
Yin, the founder and chair of APA, American Public Service Association Education Foundation.

32:07.726 --> 32:08.787
I'm here to do two parts.

32:09.448 --> 32:17.113
One is that the Fiona Amati, chairman of the Board of Equalization, asked me to read her letter.

32:17.133 --> 32:21.276
I'm only going to read a part of that because they're long.

32:21.877 --> 32:25.720
First, Dr. Kirst, APA

32:26.660 --> 32:31.345
The group is very diverse and with rich heritage and history.

32:32.126 --> 32:42.576
And when I was the speaker pro tem for assembly, I authored AB 199 to encourage the instruction of social science.

32:43.466 --> 32:50.091
to grades 7 to 12 to include the diverse aspect of API history and the culture in our textbook.

32:50.852 --> 33:04.883
And the picture now shown within the proposed textbook does not adequately depict the rich culture of diversity in the Indo-American community and Hinduism.

33:08.646 --> 33:10.327
You have one minute, so you're finished.

33:13.134 --> 33:13.474
Thank you.

33:17.079 --> 33:19.002
All speakers have one minute time limit.

33:20.624 --> 33:24.909
We will also be collecting numbers from each of the speakers as they leave the podium.

33:46.599 --> 33:48.841
We would like to wait until everybody receives their copy.

33:49.082 --> 33:50.043
Oh, please get started.

33:50.083 --> 33:51.644
They'll be right behind you.

33:51.684 --> 33:51.744
OK.

33:52.125 --> 33:53.686
We appreciate that.

33:53.766 --> 33:53.806
OK.

33:56.329 --> 34:00.252
Respected members of State Board of Education, I am Dakshita Talekar.

34:00.433 --> 34:02.394
I am from Hindu Education Foundation.

34:03.295 --> 34:06.338
I also belong to a so-called lower caste community.

34:07.432 --> 34:14.196
On Monday, an alarmist letter was submitted to you by a group named South Asian Histories for All, SAFA.

34:15.257 --> 34:19.039
The letter claims that the HSS framework is not being followed.

34:19.900 --> 34:24.022
SAFA has asked you to delay the process based on these contentions.

34:25.383 --> 34:28.685
Here, we present an analysis of their demands in the letter.

34:29.185 --> 34:30.326
The analysis is with you.

34:31.727 --> 34:40.849
Firstly, in 32 of 43 revisions proposed by SAFA, the publisher's original text already complies with the framework.

34:42.290 --> 34:45.070
Even the wording is identical to the framework.

34:46.251 --> 34:50.872
But SAFA appears to be seeking deletions or alterations to this.

34:53.328 --> 35:00.934
They are hence forcing the publisher drafts into non-compliance of framework and adoption guidelines, especially category 1.2 and 1.12.

35:00.974 --> 35:01.215
Thank you.

35:26.533 --> 35:27.013
Hello, everyone.

35:27.714 --> 35:30.015
I'd like to continue what Lakshita, she said.

35:31.155 --> 35:34.737
Please see the table we have submitted in our comments column.

35:34.917 --> 35:39.619
We have provided page numbers and line numbers of the relevant framework sections.

35:40.600 --> 35:46.983
Secondly, many of SAFA's suggestions are blatantly anti-Hindu and adversely reflect on Hinduism.

35:47.643 --> 35:56.073
leading to violations of Category 1.10 of the HSS Adoption Criteria and California's Education Code sections.

35:56.713 --> 36:01.879
Thirdly, SAFA has made contentions about erasure of history in their letter.

36:02.640 --> 36:09.064
But it is ironic that most of their edits, in fact, call for deletions of content.

36:09.705 --> 36:16.629
Safa blatantly even suggests the removal of a section on Hinduism in one of the drafts.

36:17.269 --> 36:25.395
Lastly, nowhere in their letter do we see any suggestion to add the cultural-religious contributions of so-called lower castes such as mine.

36:26.175 --> 36:34.654
Rather it is because of the effort of HEF that the histories of Hindu sages and saints from so-called lower caste were added in the framework.

36:35.115 --> 36:35.716
Thank you for your time.

36:45.874 --> 36:53.976
We thank you for your hard work in developing the curriculum framework and enforcing the social content standards.

36:55.017 --> 37:11.362
As standards and evaluation criteria and California law demand, each child should feel pride in his or her heritage and develop a sense of self-worth related to the equality of opportunity.

37:12.462 --> 37:15.383
They also forbid negative stereotyping.

37:17.037 --> 37:25.263
The bigoted and highly biased Hinduphobic edits of SAFA are directly contradictory to the law.

37:26.404 --> 37:29.366
We have made point by point analysis of SAFA's letter.

37:30.127 --> 37:37.072
It clearly shows that the asks and alarmism of SAFA are based on very flimsy grounds.

37:37.613 --> 37:39.014
We ask you to reject their edits.

37:39.734 --> 37:46.398
We also commend you for not getting alarmed by the letter and staying on the course of the SBE agenda.

37:47.319 --> 37:55.985
Again, we sincerely thank you for keeping the publishers stick to the framework.

37:56.425 --> 37:56.845
Thank you.

38:03.516 --> 38:05.897
respected members of the State Board of Education.

38:06.438 --> 38:09.880
I am Archana, teacher in Campbell Union High School District.

38:10.500 --> 38:16.783
Representing the teacher community, I have submitted letters signed by many teachers across California.

38:17.324 --> 38:30.251
We teachers strive to instill in each child a sense of pride in his or her heritage, develop a feeling of self-worth to equality of opportunity, eradicate the roots of prejudice,

38:30.791 --> 38:40.877
We also want students to become aware of accepting of religious diversity while being allowed to remain secure in any religious beliefs they may already have.

38:41.697 --> 38:49.601
IQC has made openly and collaboratively worked hard to attain these by rejecting biased textbooks by HMH.

38:50.882 --> 38:53.704
along with many other teachers across the state.

38:53.904 --> 38:54.625
I thank them.

38:55.205 --> 39:00.489
Please uphold the IQC's recommendations and reject biased and prejudicial textbooks.

39:01.010 --> 39:03.232
Reject both books by HMH.

39:03.832 --> 39:13.419
Also, I please ask you to adopt McGraw-Hill and National Geography textbooks only if all the edits proposed by them are accepted.

39:13.760 --> 39:14.180
Thank you.

39:19.830 --> 39:25.922
Dear members of SBE, I am Deepti and I'm here on behalf of Hindu Education Foundation.

39:27.074 --> 39:36.342
On Monday, a last-minute letter was submitted to you by HMH regarding their 628 program that was rejected by IQC.

39:37.403 --> 39:50.073
HMH made several claims on criteria based on their subjective analysis and not on the criteria as defined by the California's Code of Regulations.

39:50.654 --> 39:52.515
You've been prevented with the analysis.

39:52.535 --> 39:54.057
The appendix lists the tables.

39:55.219 --> 39:56.480
Here are the broad points.

39:56.800 --> 40:08.526
One, HMH in their letter acknowledges the higher than normal volume of corrections, but classify the majority of errors incorrectly as errata.

40:09.807 --> 40:11.268
Analyzing their changes,

40:12.307 --> 40:23.993
and utilizing the definitions of California Code of Regulations, Title 5, Education, 5 CCR, Section 9510H and 9510R.

40:24.293 --> 40:28.575
The analysis finds the claims are inaccurate and misleading.

40:28.855 --> 40:29.295
Thank you.

40:43.902 --> 40:44.963
Hello, I'm Shivani.

40:45.383 --> 40:47.224
I'm continuing after the previous speaker.

40:47.904 --> 40:53.847
We've provided grade-wise data with severity of change that clarifies much higher volume of major changes.

40:54.428 --> 41:02.532
In our analysis, we found that 26% or 946 of the changes that they submitted are very significant changes.

41:03.032 --> 41:11.497
If we consider edits of medium severity also, that's 76% of their edits are considerably significant, causing changes in the narrative.

41:12.117 --> 41:21.446
Even with such major rewrites, it fails to solve the underlying issues of adverse reflection, as defined in Category 1.10 of HSS Adoption Guidelines.

41:22.286 --> 41:29.473
Even the changes that were submitted were incomplete or the edits talk of replacements, but don't tell full details of what the replacements are going to be.

41:30.073 --> 41:35.656
No publisher content can be allowed based on a promise of change when the content itself is not known.

41:36.216 --> 41:41.958
The handful of corrections for the Hinduism in Ancient India section failed to even address the violations of Category 1.

41:43.099 --> 41:49.041
HMH's drafts are blatantly racist, stereotypical, and show Hinduism as an inferior to other religions.

41:49.862 --> 41:50.142
Thank you.

41:53.717 --> 42:00.900
Respected members of SB, I am Archana Shinde, a parent of two children from Cupertino Union School District.

42:01.280 --> 42:05.422
I'm shocked to see the incorrect and imaginary contents regarding Hindus in the textbooks.

42:05.802 --> 42:10.024
So here I am today to speak against the demonization of Hindus and Indians.

42:10.344 --> 42:14.186
I completely support ICAS's decision to reject two worst programs of HMH.

42:15.166 --> 42:18.489
McGraw-Hill textbooks has a lot of prejudiced and racist content.

42:18.930 --> 42:25.036
National Geographic has completely ignored 20 major items from Hindu history, thereby completely erasing our history.

42:25.496 --> 42:30.121
I request SBE to say no to hatred against Hindus in all forms.

42:30.582 --> 42:34.566
National Geographic has submitted a document to the CDE with corrections.

42:35.226 --> 42:40.333
National Geographic books should be adopted only if all the changes are reflected in their textbook.

42:40.813 --> 42:49.905
I also support recommendations by Professor Geoffrey Long and 38 other accommodations and expect those to be taken into consideration during collection or rewriting.

42:50.106 --> 42:50.406
Thank you.

42:57.526 --> 42:59.588
respected members of the State Board of Education.

43:00.589 --> 43:03.773
First of all, thank you for the opportunity to speak here.

43:04.693 --> 43:05.855
My name is Venu Acharya.

43:05.875 --> 43:07.496
I'm from Folsom, California.

43:07.516 --> 43:14.183
I stand in front of you to speak against the demonization of Hindu religion and ancient Indian culture.

43:14.203 --> 43:17.327
I stand here as a Hindu American and also

43:18.007 --> 43:23.469
as Indian-American to give voice to the three million people of our community who could not be here.

43:23.649 --> 43:24.629
We have one demand.

43:24.729 --> 43:26.610
Please stop demonization of Hindus.

43:27.290 --> 43:28.310
Please stop hatred.

43:28.590 --> 43:31.051
And the best place to start this is the textbooks.

43:32.251 --> 43:40.994
We are here in solidarity with the LGBTQ coalition and with the support of numerous public officials, including California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom.

43:41.534 --> 43:49.842
thousands of Indian Americans, Hindus, Jains, Buddhists, interfaith groups, and all the like-minded people of California who today want hate to be rejected.

43:50.202 --> 43:54.286
We all have just one thing to ask from the State Board of Education.

43:54.506 --> 43:56.648
Stop hatred against the Hindus and Indians.

44:00.232 --> 44:01.373
Thank you for the opportunity.

44:07.665 --> 44:12.489
Respected state hearing committee members, my name is Guru Dutt and my daughter studies in eighth grade.

44:13.070 --> 44:19.996
When we studied history chapter, it's hard for me to convince my daughter about the contents in a textbook which are misinterpreted.

44:20.496 --> 44:28.243
We are seeing textbooks portraying 6,000 years of Hindu culture as being the religion of monkeys and elephants.

44:28.983 --> 44:37.973
We wholeheartedly appreciate IQC's decision of rejecting HMH and NatGeo because the textbook needs a lot of sanitization.

44:38.514 --> 44:39.855
Few things that caught my mind.

44:40.296 --> 44:45.482
We see Indian laborers working alongside monkeys and hereby equating Indians to monkeys.

44:46.022 --> 44:50.204
This is clear violation of California state law ECS 51501.

44:50.704 --> 44:53.765
Hinduism is one of the most tolerant religion in the world.

44:54.186 --> 44:57.447
Upanishads and Vedas in the books are misinterpreted.

44:57.947 --> 45:08.632
But in the same books, the Upanishads and Vedas have a phrase called Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, which means the world is one, which also can be read as we are all one.

45:09.192 --> 45:11.853
Justice can be delayed, but not be denied.

45:12.174 --> 45:14.194
I would request the honorable committee members to

45:15.615 --> 45:15.935
Thank you.

45:21.898 --> 45:31.284
Dear members of the State Board of Education, I'm Satish Nagaraj, parent of one child studying in seventh grade in Granite Oaks Middle School, Rocklin, California.

45:32.264 --> 45:35.906
I'm shocked about the content used about India and Hinduism.

45:36.867 --> 45:44.511
I'm a true believer that all have their own right to practice any religion, but should not undermine other religion and their beliefs.

45:45.700 --> 45:47.502
Some of the publishers are in that direction.

45:48.242 --> 45:56.510
I strongly condemn their intentions of using bad pictures and contents about India and Hindu way of living.

45:57.131 --> 45:57.371
Thank you.

46:02.873 --> 46:09.142
We would like to make certain that all people numbers 1 through 24 have had an opportunity to line up.

46:09.623 --> 46:15.752
And at this time, if you are numbers 25 through 48, please start lining up outside.

46:15.772 --> 46:16.433
Thank you.

46:23.493 --> 46:32.101
Panelists, I am Jyoti Yelgalwadi, a publisher based in Tracy, and I've been participating in these hearings from the beginning.

46:32.861 --> 46:34.243
Thanks for all your hard work.

46:35.384 --> 46:37.666
The framework was completed in June 2016.

46:40.404 --> 46:47.906
The publishers had 10 months until April 2017 to review and prepare the data, which would be part of the book.

46:48.706 --> 46:53.707
From April 2017 to September, publishers had time to finalize the book.

46:54.547 --> 46:55.487
That's a lot of time.

46:56.608 --> 46:59.148
14 months to complete a draft and present to review.

46:59.168 --> 47:07.230
HMH handed over 4,000 corrections just a week before so that no one could really review it.

47:08.283 --> 47:14.009
These corrections proved to be wrong, insulting, and disgusting.

47:15.330 --> 47:22.758
Its image seems to rest on all its laurels, thinking that due to its fame, whatever it does will be accepted.

47:23.839 --> 47:29.205
I am an independent publisher and can guarantee that I would do a better job in a third of the time.

47:30.106 --> 47:30.446
Thank you.

47:38.018 --> 47:39.960
Respected members of the SBE.

47:40.400 --> 47:40.900
Good morning.

47:41.461 --> 47:46.325
My name is Abirinima Hajan and I'm a fifth grader in the Sunnyvale School District.

47:46.805 --> 47:50.888
This is my second time here in CDE with another missed school day.

47:51.589 --> 47:55.452
I'm really sad that I have to go home and do my extra schoolwork and homework.

47:56.273 --> 47:59.515
Anyways I'm here to stand up for my Indian-American friends.

48:00.676 --> 48:04.679
I don't like to see my friends being bullied and it is not a happy experience.

48:05.220 --> 48:06.481
According to the bullying report

48:07.003 --> 48:12.565
Every 1 out of 3 Indian-American student is being bullied because he or she is a Hindu or Indian.

48:13.445 --> 48:22.048
If textbooks are teaching us this then these textbooks are wrong and should be taken away immediately to create education a positive experience for everybody.

48:22.808 --> 48:28.630
I'm really happy and thankful to IQC for rejecting HMH 2 programs.

48:29.410 --> 48:30.430
It was the right decision.

48:30.890 --> 48:35.412
I would like to request all the SBE members to also reject Harcourt and other bad books.

48:35.632 --> 48:35.932
Thank you.

48:44.574 --> 48:45.114
Namaste.

48:45.755 --> 48:46.675
My name is Amar Nadig.

48:46.895 --> 48:50.317
I'm a parent of two daughters in third and seventh grade.

48:51.537 --> 48:57.620
One of my older daughter just read the textbook last year and was quite embarrassed when she came home and asked me about Hinduism.

48:58.360 --> 49:03.943
She also asked me questions about why we are being, my community or my people are being represented in a certain way.

49:04.643 --> 49:11.506
And why a classroom divides, the teachers in the classroom are instructed to divide the classroom into four parts to represent casteism.

49:12.901 --> 49:23.809
There has to be a way to come around these topics and come up with an understanding that there is something more to Hinduism, like power for women, ahimsa, and other concepts.

49:24.329 --> 49:28.892
These, by themselves, are big chapters that we can all take from the books of Hinduism.

49:29.453 --> 49:35.617
I request you to accept the recommendations that my friends are making here and reject the ones that we don't support.

49:35.637 --> 49:35.857
Thank you.

49:44.858 --> 49:47.919
Hello, I'm Shubhangi from Los Angeles, California.

49:48.259 --> 49:57.363
I stand here as a concerned mother of a young boy, as every one out of three Hindu American children have reported of being bullied based on religious beliefs and practices.

49:58.083 --> 50:04.246
I stand here as a Hindu, an Indian, as an Asian with support of other Asians and Pacific Highlanders.

50:04.986 --> 50:10.348
I stand here to support Professor Jeffrey Long and other academics who are seeking historical accuracy.

50:11.795 --> 50:18.981
I stand here with the support of 11 assembly members, three congressmen, three senators, and numerous Hindu, Jain, and interfaith groups.

50:19.642 --> 50:29.290
And most of all, I stand here as one of the hundreds of Hindus who are speaking today and thousands of others who have sent you letters and signed petitions across from California.

50:29.810 --> 50:31.692
All of us are just saying one thing.

50:32.212 --> 50:34.094
Stop hatred against Hindus.

50:34.514 --> 50:36.175
Stop demonization of Hindus.

50:36.435 --> 50:36.776
Thank you.

50:43.792 --> 50:47.033
Respected members of State Board of Education, Namaste.

50:47.713 --> 50:49.894
I'm Basanta Vennela from Los Angeles.

50:50.614 --> 50:55.276
I have two sons, sixth grader and third grader, who go to LASD schools.

50:56.076 --> 51:03.279
As a mom, I'm concerned that the derogatory portrayal of Hinduism in textbooks adversely affects my children in classroom.

51:04.059 --> 51:09.901
I believe IQC and SBE did significant due diligence in building 2016 framework.

51:10.441 --> 51:22.904
I'm surprised that National Geographic completely ignored the framework and did not include many aspects of core teachings of Hinduism like yoga that promote peace and harmony and oneness of all living beings.

51:23.385 --> 51:27.466
There is an attempt to portray Hinduism as primitive and dirty in the textbooks.

51:28.326 --> 51:33.369
Hence, I'm here to support IQC's decision to reject HMH drafts.

51:33.989 --> 51:39.573
Request you to please reject those drafts that do not meet California law and instructional standards.

51:40.333 --> 51:46.277
Support the recommendations by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other scholars, and those be included.

51:46.417 --> 51:46.697
Thank you.

51:51.345 --> 51:54.366
Good morning, respected members of the State Board of Education.

51:54.386 --> 51:55.567
I'm Dilip Nayak.

51:56.087 --> 51:59.388
I'm father of two kids, 11 and 6, living in the Sacramento area.

52:00.429 --> 52:07.392
I'm shocked to see that on page 177 of the 6th grade textbook of HMH 6-8 program, calling Veda,

52:08.132 --> 52:13.234
Vedas, the sacred scriptures, a collection of spells and charms.

52:14.054 --> 52:15.294
Spells and charms, really?

52:16.155 --> 52:19.576
No other sacred book has been mentioned in such a denigrating terms.

52:19.956 --> 52:23.237
This is inaccurate, biased, and discriminatory.

52:23.717 --> 52:26.418
Hinduism is one of the most tolerant religions in the world.

52:27.038 --> 52:32.844
I stand here to support Jeffrey Long and other 38 other scholars who are seeking historical accuracy.

52:33.244 --> 52:39.430
I request that the recommendations of academic group be made accepted to address all the problems in the books.

52:39.790 --> 52:40.471
Thank you for your time.

52:45.307 --> 52:45.748
Namaste.

52:45.808 --> 52:47.649
Respected members of the board, I'm Kiran.

52:47.709 --> 52:48.731
I'm a concerned parent.

52:49.872 --> 52:58.881
I'm here to oppose and condemn the inappropriate content that demeans Hindu, the culture I follow, and the country, India, which I want.

53:08.277 --> 53:12.939
I appreciate and stand behind the decision of IQC to reject the programs of HMH.

53:13.319 --> 53:19.321
These programs are the worst, and even after so many revisions, they have not collectively addressed all our problems.

53:19.941 --> 53:34.586
I'm here to ensure that all the recommendations from Jeffrey Long and his academics are taken into consideration, and HMH's denigration of Hindus and Indian culture is rejected.

53:35.066 --> 53:35.526
So thank you.

53:41.053 --> 53:43.714
Namaste, dear members of State Board of Education.

53:44.394 --> 53:48.116
I'm Amit Agarwal, parent of two daughters studying in Folsom.

53:48.976 --> 53:56.319
Being the father of a fifth grader, I am concerned about the bullying of my daughter who will be going to middle school next year.

53:56.939 --> 53:59.200
I don't want her to be suppressed by her peers.

53:59.938 --> 54:01.860
or be afraid of her Hindu identity.

54:02.501 --> 54:09.669
If other students have inaccurate information about the Hindu society, it will create a bad impression on Indian community.

54:10.350 --> 54:13.874
I stand here to oppose hatred against all Hindu and Indian children.

54:14.535 --> 54:20.662
Please take immediate steps to stop the bullying of children that is happening because of stereotypes in the textbooks.

54:21.420 --> 54:28.749
You can do that by adopting Professor Long's recommendations to address the problems of bias and prejudice in the textbook.

54:29.550 --> 54:36.037
I urge the board to reject all material that has hatered against Hindus and every other community.

54:36.358 --> 54:36.658
Thank you.

54:42.742 --> 54:44.243
Good morning, respected board members.

54:44.944 --> 54:47.846
I am Regis Chobisa from El Dorado Hills, father of 10-year-old.

54:48.567 --> 54:58.295
I appreciate and fully support decision of IQC to reject the two programs of HMH, which I consider inappropriate and misleading interpretation, creating hatred amongst schools and society.

54:58.935 --> 55:10.625
I stand here not only to fight hatred against Hindu-Americans, but also to support LGBTQ community as well as African-American communities who are getting hatred in the school as well as in the community.

55:11.145 --> 55:19.207
Hinduism is the only major religion that recognizes divinity in all people, all individuals, respect for every living being, including plants and animals.

55:20.027 --> 55:22.428
Education is light and ignorance is darkness.

55:23.228 --> 55:34.691
With this statement, I demand the right education by acceptance of all recommendations of academic coalition by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other top academics.

55:35.351 --> 55:39.812
All of us are saying just one thing, stop hatred against Hindus, stop demonization of Hindus.

55:40.032 --> 55:40.352
Thank you.

55:45.680 --> 55:48.521
Respected members of SBE, I am audible.

55:48.961 --> 55:51.541
My name is Sudarshan Ramayanam, came from Roseville.

55:52.202 --> 55:57.403
The HMS K6 and 628 have pictures that show Hindus with trash and as dirty.

55:58.003 --> 56:05.945
A bullying report about Hindu American children calls a seventh grade child as being called as dirty as Hindu by their classmates.

56:06.745 --> 56:09.386
Hindu children face this all the time in the classrooms.

56:09.826 --> 56:13.827
Is it not clear from where these ideas of Hindus being dirty came from?

56:14.554 --> 56:22.683
I commend AQC for rejecting the two Hinduphobic books that had the images that conflate dirt with Hinduism and India.

56:23.424 --> 56:25.946
But I think more needs to be done.

56:26.186 --> 56:33.034
I stand here in solitary with all Hindu American children who have been bullied and who have to face hatred in classrooms.

56:33.354 --> 56:34.776
Thanks for giving me opportunity.

56:34.836 --> 56:35.116
Thank you.

56:39.051 --> 56:39.692
Hey, good morning.

56:39.752 --> 56:43.034
This is Sarvesh, and I'm from Irvine.

56:43.654 --> 56:47.717
And I'm a parent of a fourth grader and kindergartner.

56:48.338 --> 56:58.945
And I'm concerned about the California education system that has failed to make my kids proud of their culture and their origins.

56:59.486 --> 57:01.667
So due to the bullying and other

57:04.388 --> 57:12.831
unsocial stuff they went through because of the misinterpretation and misrepresentation of the religion.

57:13.831 --> 57:21.293
Hinduism and all the textbooks like HMH and the Netgeo

57:22.313 --> 57:24.395
are representing Hinduism in a wrong way.

57:24.835 --> 57:40.568
I support IQC's decision to reject HMH for Kindergarten to 6th program and I request Board to reject NetGeo because of the content that has been put in against Hinduism.

57:41.268 --> 57:41.709
Thanks a lot.

57:45.595 --> 57:51.180
Respected members of State Board of Education, teaching history comes with its own unique challenges in the classroom.

57:52.201 --> 57:56.664
Hence, textbooks not only have to be historically accurate, but also culturally competent.

57:57.545 --> 58:12.337
Material that failed to treat all cultures with fairness or negatively reflect upon the religious and cultural heritage of children can not only lead to psychological problems within students, but also encourage bullying of children, especially from minority communities.

58:13.178 --> 58:17.160
It poses severe challenges in creating a safe and nurturing learning environment.

58:18.420 --> 58:23.502
We request you to adopt new curriculum that will give our children access to accurate history.

58:24.262 --> 58:31.225
And also, I thank IQC for their work and request you to please reject HMH.

58:31.986 --> 58:32.706
And thank you for your time.

58:36.564 --> 58:37.424
Good morning to all of you.

58:37.744 --> 58:39.025
My name is Deepak Sharma.

58:39.705 --> 58:42.025
I am from Southern California, Irvine.

58:42.846 --> 58:48.187
I, together with about 100 families, came here today to represent our concerns to all of you.

58:49.087 --> 58:57.149
If this hearing was being held on a Saturday, you might see 10 times more people because that's the level of concern at the grassroots level about these books.

58:57.849 --> 58:58.929
My own daughter is a teacher.

58:59.049 --> 59:00.150
She teaches high school English.

59:01.670 --> 59:07.311
Our only request is that there should be fairness depicted in the California textbooks towards our religion.

59:08.092 --> 59:17.074
We want our children and their friends to go in and learn about the positive aspects of it versus learning things and getting bullied about it.

59:17.734 --> 59:18.074
Thank you.

59:22.235 --> 59:22.675
Good morning.

59:24.818 --> 59:26.900
I'm a mother of two adult daughters.

59:27.180 --> 59:27.981
They're 26 and 25.

59:28.021 --> 59:30.163
They're done with their college.

59:30.183 --> 59:30.903
They're employed.

59:31.464 --> 59:35.587
But the experience that they had in their high school years still haunts me.

59:36.067 --> 59:44.054
And as a parent, it bothers me so much that I have taken days off and come here repeatedly in front of the committee in the public hearing.

59:45.205 --> 59:57.933
So the reason I'm here is it's important for me so that this new generation should be aware about the Hinduism in India and the positive light that they learn, the same for other religions and countries.

59:58.653 --> 01:00:05.037
When the Quality Committee rejected the hate-filled books, it was a great celebratory moment.

01:00:05.458 --> 01:00:10.821
And I hope that we continue to follow the framework which is not supported by the other books.

01:00:12.881 --> 01:00:15.583
We do not need our children to grow up in a divisive society.

01:00:16.343 --> 01:00:22.488
The young minds need to nurture towards unity so that the educational material should be of high accurate quality.

01:00:23.028 --> 01:00:24.869
Textbook is not a place for hatred.

01:00:25.590 --> 01:00:27.211
It is not a place for politics as well.

01:00:27.391 --> 01:00:27.751
Thank you.

01:00:32.494 --> 01:00:33.315
Good morning, everyone.

01:00:34.076 --> 01:00:39.860
My name is Nik Saad, parent of two near future middle schoolers in Union School District of San Jose.

01:00:41.095 --> 01:00:42.076
I am not a Hindu.

01:00:42.896 --> 01:00:48.759
Having grown up in the beautiful multicultural setting of India, I do understand its culture and religious tapestry deeply.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:58.805
I completely support the IQC's rejection of the HMH textbooks as being both irretrievably biased, offensive, and inaccurate in both facts and narrative.

01:00:59.945 --> 01:01:13.695
I have seen the proposed textbook sections on Hinduism in specificity and my majority association, India in general, can clearly say that it is in no way reflective of the reality that I grew up in or the India that my daughters see when they visit their grandparents.

01:01:14.375 --> 01:01:20.740
I don't want to stand by while my daughters are taught completely slanted so-called facts in their school class in front of their peers.

01:01:21.747 --> 01:01:32.047
As an Indian-origin parent in the Bay Area, I would ask you to adopt the recommendations of the IQC, compel the textbooks that build the minds of our children to be accurate and non-discriminatory in their narrative.

01:01:32.508 --> 01:01:33.250
Thank you for your time.

01:01:37.486 --> 01:01:38.006
Good morning.

01:01:38.146 --> 01:01:39.527
My name is Inder Kaur.

01:01:39.787 --> 01:01:40.207
I'm a U.S.

01:01:40.267 --> 01:01:43.809
citizen, and I was born in Kashmir, India.

01:01:44.109 --> 01:01:45.270
I'm a Kashmiri pundit.

01:01:45.610 --> 01:01:55.635
The word pundit came into English lexicon based on my community, and we spearheaded the education in India from time immemorial.

01:01:56.535 --> 01:02:02.258
There is nothing here I want to say that has not been said, but I want to say a couple of things from heart.

01:02:04.739 --> 01:02:06.619
There was a scholar from India.

01:02:06.719 --> 01:02:09.900
He said the vanities of this world are transient.

01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:12.621
Those alone live, who live for others.

01:02:13.221 --> 01:02:15.202
The rest are more dead than alive.

01:02:15.762 --> 01:02:16.922
It's modern times.

01:02:17.222 --> 01:02:19.163
This is the time to shun hatred.

01:02:19.643 --> 01:02:27.649
shun bigotry, shun fanaticism, and shun any opportunity to make another religion feel inferior.

01:02:28.149 --> 01:02:36.154
And this scholar said, help and not fight, assimilation and not destruction, harmony and peace and not dissension.

01:02:36.474 --> 01:02:37.115
Thank you very much.

01:02:41.365 --> 01:02:46.549
Respected members of the State Board of Education, I am Pratik Shah, a parent from Sunnyvale.

01:02:47.089 --> 01:02:53.513
I am extremely shocked by seeing textbooks in California which portrait inaccurate Indian history and Hinduism.

01:02:54.074 --> 01:02:59.758
I appreciate IQC's decision to reject HMH because these textbooks are Hinduphobia.

01:03:00.578 --> 01:03:03.199
but rejecting them alone is not enough.

01:03:03.659 --> 01:03:07.101
Recently, National Geographic submitted documents with corrections.

01:03:07.541 --> 01:03:14.965
National Geographic books should be adopted only if all these changes are reflected in their textbooks.

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:23.228
I request you to accept the recommendations of the academic coalition by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other top academics.

01:03:23.668 --> 01:03:24.729
Thank you for listening.

01:03:29.656 --> 01:03:31.557
Good morning, respected members of the SVE.

01:03:32.117 --> 01:03:34.999
I'm Sujata Joshi, a concerned parent from San Jose.

01:03:35.579 --> 01:03:38.920
I'm greatly disappointed with negative portrayal of India and Hinduism.

01:03:39.381 --> 01:03:45.904
My daughter came here four times with tears in her eyes and requesting to stop the bullying of Hindu kids.

01:03:46.424 --> 01:03:51.986
I'm here to support IQC's decision to reject HMH 628 and K-6 programs.

01:03:52.567 --> 01:03:55.968
National Geographic has also omitted many sections from 2016 framework.

01:03:57.549 --> 01:03:58.670
They are submitted corrections.

01:03:59.390 --> 01:04:03.213
Accept those only if all the requested changes are really good.

01:04:03.613 --> 01:04:11.758
I also demand that all the recommendation from academic coalition of Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other top academics to be accepted.

01:04:12.019 --> 01:04:12.279
Thank you.

01:04:17.415 --> 01:04:23.560
Respected members of SBE, I am a homemaker and a mother of two daughters who are in fourth and first grade.

01:04:23.921 --> 01:04:32.248
I was shocked and heartbroken when I heard about this textbook issue, which made me come all the way from Pasadena, leaving my kids behind to voice my opinion.

01:04:32.708 --> 01:04:37.272
I strongly believe that education is an effective medium to mould students' personality.

01:04:37.712 --> 01:04:42.877
The education I received during my school years still has a great impact on who I am today.

01:04:43.397 --> 01:04:48.101
The information children learn in elementary, middle and high school shapes their thinking process.

01:04:48.541 --> 01:04:50.363
Today's kids are tomorrow's leaders.

01:04:50.923 --> 01:04:58.289
In order to create responsible citizens of future, we must teach children to respect each other and to respect each other's religion and culture.

01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:04.374
I cannot accept the negative and biased approach towards Hinduism and India taught in any school.

01:05:05.095 --> 01:05:11.180
I thank and strongly support IQC for the rejection of HMH programs and humbly request you to do the same.

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:12.141
Thank you for listening.

01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:17.520
Hi, good afternoon.

01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:18.801
My name is Mary Yin Liu.

01:05:18.821 --> 01:05:26.244
I am a local McDonald's business owner and also executive board member for APAPA, Asian Pacific Islander American Public Affairs Association.

01:05:27.045 --> 01:05:28.985
And our community is united today.

01:05:29.066 --> 01:05:30.526
We are an inclusive community.

01:05:30.926 --> 01:05:33.828
We believe in diversity, fairness, and

01:05:34.668 --> 01:05:35.548
Also, education.

01:05:35.588 --> 01:05:45.812
I have children in the public school systems, and I would like them to have the opportunity to see and experience the culture and religion of India and Hinduism that is positive, that reflects many of our travels.

01:05:46.292 --> 01:05:48.253
And they will not have the opportunity to do that.

01:05:48.853 --> 01:05:52.135
So I urge you to consider your position seriously today.

01:05:52.675 --> 01:05:58.317
You know, history is made based on interpretation of the facts, and you are empowered to truly make history.

01:05:58.777 --> 01:06:02.459
Much groundwork has been laid before today in good faith and with due diligence.

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:05.601
The community has reached out to many book publishers.

01:06:06.122 --> 01:06:08.383
Most have made these simple updates and accommodations.

01:06:08.843 --> 01:06:14.047
However, we are appalled and disappointed to see the disparity remaining with these three publishers.

01:06:14.767 --> 01:06:20.531
And we ask that they treat the races and countries and religions equally for all, not just a few.

01:06:20.791 --> 01:06:21.191
Thank you.

01:06:26.795 --> 01:06:28.056
Hello.

01:06:30.467 --> 01:06:33.708
I'm Shantaram Nekar from the Hindu Education Foundation.

01:06:34.268 --> 01:06:51.793
I'm here to present a petition from more than 14,000 people, parents, community members, leaders, et cetera, from across the state and the country, asking for unbiased and fair portrayal of Hinduism in all the textbooks in California.

01:06:52.333 --> 01:06:56.336
So a formal printout of the petition has been submitted online.

01:06:56.876 --> 01:06:57.636
It's 600 pages long.

01:06:58.017 --> 01:06:59.617
So I have a copy which has been circulated out here.

01:07:00.098 --> 01:07:04.260
I really urge you to consider the voice of all the people very, very strongly.

01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:12.445
In addition, I also kind of just want to empathize the really good work done by IQC over the past seven years, detailed work.

01:07:12.625 --> 01:07:13.346
I thank them for the work.

01:07:13.706 --> 01:07:19.650
And I support their recommendation or their son to reject the textbook from HMH.

01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:28.284
I also wish that the textbooks from McGraw-Hill and National Geographic will be accepted only if the proposed changes are accepted.

01:07:28.304 --> 01:07:29.166
Thank you very much.

01:07:37.950 --> 01:07:51.060
I, Vijay Handebag, a concerned parent, a practicing Hindu, and a member of Hindu Education Foundation, commend the IQC for the hard work it has put in the process to adopt the K-8 history textbooks.

01:07:51.621 --> 01:08:00.208
At the same time, I would like to draw your attention in the last-minute submission and attempt to disrupt this process by a group calling itself SAFA.

01:08:00.908 --> 01:08:23.097
Unlike our coalition that actively participated in all the public hearings, panel deliberations with hundreds of Hindu American community members, parents, and children of diverse social and professional backgrounds from all parts of California, taking time off of work and school to make public comments, SAFA has chosen to intervene at the last minute for reasons unknown to us.

01:08:24.497 --> 01:08:30.081
They had ample opportunity to participate in the process and submit their views to the IQC and publishers.

01:08:30.762 --> 01:08:40.569
And our engagement is not against any caste or religion, but for a fair and accurate depiction of Hinduism and India in adherence to CA education code and framework.

01:08:40.689 --> 01:08:41.069
Thank you.

01:08:46.564 --> 01:08:47.484
Good morning, board members.

01:08:47.664 --> 01:08:51.086
My name is Samir Kalra, senior director with the Hindu American Foundation.

01:08:51.526 --> 01:08:56.208
First of all, I'd like to start by appreciating the hard work of the IQC over this process of the last year.

01:08:56.869 --> 01:09:04.152
As part of this process, we have provided feedback to most of the publishers, participated in several hearings, and submitted public comments to the IQC.

01:09:04.752 --> 01:09:15.717
While we have had constructive engagement with many of the publishers and saw many areas of improvement, we are disappointed that there are still specific draft materials that do not adequately or accurately reflect Hinduism in India.

01:09:16.577 --> 01:09:30.427
And despite our constructive engagement with publishers, including HMH, they have not incorporated all of our feedback, and therefore I want to emphasize that we cannot endorse their textbooks since they do not reflect a balanced narrative grounded in academic consensus or are consistent with the framework.

01:09:30.547 --> 01:09:36.611
Consequently, we support the recommendation of the IQC to reject the drafts of both Upton Mifflin programs.

01:09:37.271 --> 01:09:44.455
We also support the edits suggested from McGraw-Hill in a letter dated October 31st from the Coalition of 30 Academics led by Professor Jeffrey Long.

01:09:44.915 --> 01:09:51.319
And finally, we support the adoption of National Geographic Learning's program with the acceptance of all of their proposed edits from November 6th.

01:09:51.439 --> 01:09:51.979
Thank you very much.

01:09:58.168 --> 01:09:58.748
Hello, everyone.

01:09:58.889 --> 01:10:04.493
I'm Chandrasekhar Wagh, representing Hindu Education Foundation, and also a concerned parent of two kids.

01:10:05.014 --> 01:10:11.219
I'm here to represent a coalition of support from a group of 38 academics led by Professor Jeffrey Long.

01:10:11.799 --> 01:10:26.091
We have received a coalition support from more than 75 organizations, including Anti-Defamation League, Silicon Valley Interreligious Council, Californians Together, Asian Pacific Islander American Public Affairs Association,

01:10:26.771 --> 01:10:30.513
Also, many Indian, Hindu, Jain, and interfaith organizations.

01:10:30.994 --> 01:10:35.896
We also have received support from 17 elected officials.

01:10:35.916 --> 01:10:40.699
A letter of support has been handed over to honorable board members.

01:10:41.319 --> 01:10:47.323
So, what we are asking here to reject is the Hafton-Mafflin Court, Kids Discovery California Social Studies, K-6,

01:10:48.303 --> 01:11:05.863
reject Hoplin, Mifflin, Harcourt's social studies for California 628, adopt National Geographic if their proposed edits of November 6th are accepted in their entirely, adopt McGraw-Hill if all of the edits corrections recommended on October 30th are incorporated in their entirely.

01:11:06.063 --> 01:11:06.524
Thank you very much.

01:11:08.986 --> 01:11:15.310
At this time, we would like to make certain that all numbers 24 through 48 have lined up.

01:11:15.570 --> 01:11:17.971
If you have not done so, please do so now.

01:11:18.652 --> 01:11:22.914
And out in the lobby, we are asking people who have numbers through 100 to be lined up.

01:11:22.934 --> 01:11:23.174
Thank you.

01:11:26.618 --> 01:11:34.220
Dear members of the State Board of Education, I am Soham Shikawat, studying in 7th grade in Iron Horse Middle School.

01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:38.641
I've come here to talk about my experience last year, in 6th grade.

01:11:39.141 --> 01:11:44.242
Last year when I found out that our class was learning about the Hindu religion, I got very excited.

01:11:44.702 --> 01:11:49.683
But I got disappointed when I read and saw pictures of things that are not true in the textbook.

01:11:50.342 --> 01:11:53.386
Also, our teacher said wrong information about our Hindu gods.

01:11:54.007 --> 01:11:55.489
Hearing this, I got very shocked.

01:11:55.869 --> 01:12:06.723
My parents corrected the information for me, but for people of other religions, their parents might not know the right information and they might assume that the information being read in class is true.

01:12:07.504 --> 01:12:13.649
This child will then think less of children like me and I don't want to face easy, avoidable discrimination.

01:12:14.129 --> 01:12:17.772
To me, Hinduism is not just a religion, it's who you are from inside.

01:12:18.132 --> 01:12:20.674
So please help correct this oversight in books.

01:12:20.774 --> 01:12:21.535
Thanks for listening.

01:12:27.355 --> 01:12:32.937
Respected member of State Board of Education, I'm Gulshan Jeet from San Ramon, California.

01:12:33.337 --> 01:12:41.140
The edits that the French Hindu phobic group, South Asian Histories for All, is suggested seems to be driven by hate.

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:53.885
They are requesting to add more caste into the textbooks, even though caste forms more than 30% of the content in sections on Hinduism and Asian India in all textbooks.

01:12:54.605 --> 01:12:59.670
No other section discusses social structures of its civilization in such detail.

01:13:00.331 --> 01:13:03.794
It sounds strange when they say caste is being erased.

01:13:04.335 --> 01:13:11.642
When they are trying to do so is to twist that content in such a way as to perpetuate hatred against Hindus.

01:13:12.082 --> 01:13:17.848
The narrative of caste which they want to introduce into the textbook is highly Hinduphobic.

01:13:18.468 --> 01:13:24.515
The changes that they suggest will not only lead to Category 1 violation, especially Category 1.10.

01:13:26.718 --> 01:13:31.964
I hope that you will see the inaccuracies and hateful motives of these edits and reject them.

01:13:32.144 --> 01:13:32.485
Thank you.

01:13:38.141 --> 01:13:44.264
Dear members of State Board of Education, I am Radha Krishna, resident of Los Angeles Studio City.

01:13:44.844 --> 01:13:54.128
I am here in Sacramento missing my work day to make myself heard and to speak against the demonization of Hindus and its religion.

01:13:54.828 --> 01:14:07.313
I fully support the decision of IQC, Instructional Quality Commission, to reject the two programs of HMH Houghton, Mifflin, Harcourt, which are racist and Hindu-phobic in nature.

01:14:08.194 --> 01:14:17.306
I also request board members to consider all the recommendations put forth by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 prominent academics.

01:14:17.567 --> 01:14:17.847
Thank you.

01:14:22.745 --> 01:14:29.088
Good morning, board members, Superintendent Torlakson, Julian Conetti, President and CEO of the California Hispanic Chambers of Commerce.

01:14:29.869 --> 01:14:44.896
As many of you know, over decades, the Hispanic community here in California has always strived to assure that Hispanics are portrayed in historical, accurate, equitable, culturally competent manner in textbooks.

01:14:45.516 --> 01:14:50.159
And we've worked with legislators and educators and elected officials throughout the state.

01:14:51.079 --> 01:15:04.508
Today I'm here before you to urge you to reject the two proposed textbooks from Houghton, Milfen, and Harcourt, as we feel they do not portray Hinduism in India in a historical, accurate, equitable, or culturally competent manner.

01:15:05.809 --> 01:15:13.675
And we feel this is also consistent with the academic recommendations that were led by Professor Jeffrey Long.

01:15:13.835 --> 01:15:14.075
Thank you.

01:15:19.414 --> 01:15:19.874
Good morning.

01:15:20.075 --> 01:15:28.902
My name is Glenn Fuji, National Executive Director of APAPA, and I'm here today to support our Hindu and Indian American communities.

01:15:29.783 --> 01:15:41.053
And our biggest concern right now is that they've gone through a decade quest of trying to get equality and being treated with dignity in the California textbooks K through 8.

01:15:41.994 --> 01:15:46.218
We're strong believers that with your support, we really

01:15:47.125 --> 01:16:02.695
We really urge you to reject these two textbooks, K-8 and California Textbook System from HMH, who really disrespect and inappropriately represent both the Hindu and Indian American communities.

01:16:02.775 --> 01:16:05.517
And we're fighting just to get your support.

01:16:05.677 --> 01:16:08.639
We strongly believe and urge you to help us today.

01:16:09.019 --> 01:16:09.640
Thank you very much.

01:16:15.942 --> 01:16:23.788
Dear members of State Board Education, I am Bhargavi parent of two parents, two kids in San Ramon Valley School District.

01:16:24.508 --> 01:16:27.010
I am a volunteer for SEWA International.

01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:31.814
We serve all people in communities including Indians and non-Indians.

01:16:32.494 --> 01:16:37.418
I'm here to oppose Hindu phobia and hatred against my heritage.

01:16:38.258 --> 01:16:45.700
IQC has shown the courage to reject hatred and prejudice by rejecting two Hinduphobic books.

01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:57.922
We request SBE also to reject all hateful content, some of which is in other books and other being pushed by Hinduphobic groups at this last moment.

01:16:58.443 --> 01:17:03.264
I request SBE to say no to hatred against Hindus in all forms.

01:17:03.604 --> 01:17:04.484
Thank you for your time.

01:17:10.606 --> 01:17:15.128
Dear members of the School Board of Education, I am Kedar Bhole.

01:17:16.188 --> 01:17:18.089
My son, Neil, is five years of age.

01:17:18.869 --> 01:17:22.690
He is a student of La Rosa Elementary School in Temple City, California.

01:17:23.831 --> 01:17:26.492
My wife, my son, and I are practicing Hindus.

01:17:27.752 --> 01:17:31.993
I am deeply concerned with the depiction of Hinduism in the sixth grade textbook drafts.

01:17:32.994 --> 01:17:37.735
This is why I have taken a day off from work today and I've driven 400 miles to speak to you.

01:17:38.895 --> 01:17:47.017
I am grateful to the Instructional Quality Commission, the IQC, for their recommendation to reject the textbook drafts of Harcourt.

01:17:47.978 --> 01:17:49.978
However, this is not sufficient.

01:17:51.218 --> 01:17:56.020
I find the contents of McGraw-Hill and National Geographic Education to be biased as well.

01:17:57.180 --> 01:18:01.142
I stand here to oppose hatred against Hindus and Hinduism.

01:18:02.383 --> 01:18:10.608
I agree with the comments and the suggestions made by Professor Jeffrey Long and his team, and I strongly urge you to implement these recommendations.

01:18:11.028 --> 01:18:11.288
Thank you.

01:18:17.006 --> 01:18:18.708
Hello, my name is Mala Gavin.

01:18:18.808 --> 01:18:22.553
I'm a retired teacher from Rowland Unified in Southern California.

01:18:23.314 --> 01:18:27.940
Diverse cultures was a central theme in my curriculum.

01:18:28.101 --> 01:18:33.227
I am deeply concerned about the draft textbooks, depictions of Indian Hinduism.

01:18:34.048 --> 01:18:45.632
Remember just a few years ago when entire school districts held workshops for all the teachers on cultural proficiency so that we could rid ourselves of bias and discrimination?

01:18:46.432 --> 01:18:50.934
What use is that if we have bias and discrimination in our textbooks?

01:18:51.574 --> 01:18:56.396
Having respectful portrayals of all cultures is necessary for our credibility.

01:18:57.016 --> 01:19:02.458
Students begin to doubt everything that is taught to them if we do not give them truthful information.

01:19:03.238 --> 01:19:04.799
I have studied the Bhagavad Gita.

01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:18.349
Page 280 of the McGraw-Hill 6th grade textbook uses a translation that should be replaced by one from the Bhagavad Gita as it is the most widely published Bhagavad Gita in the world translated into 50 languages.

01:19:19.769 --> 01:19:23.172
I request also McGraw-Hill grade 7 be replaced.

01:19:23.292 --> 01:19:23.852
Page 160.

01:19:24.733 --> 01:19:25.533
Not accurate.

01:19:25.553 --> 01:19:26.194
Thank you very much.

01:19:30.202 --> 01:19:32.064
Respected members, I am Vinayak Fadnavis.

01:19:32.484 --> 01:19:35.487
I am standing here on behalf of Hindu Education Foundation.

01:19:36.488 --> 01:19:42.493
On Monday, a last-minute letter was submitted to you by HMH regarding their 6-8 program that was rejected by IQC.

01:19:43.234 --> 01:19:44.715
They have made several claims in the letter.

01:19:45.235 --> 01:19:52.282
We would like to show how the claims are based on their subjective analysis and not the criteria as defined by California's Code of Regulations.

01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:54.481
Analysis is in front of you.

01:19:54.621 --> 01:19:56.421
The appendix has the tables that has the data.

01:19:56.641 --> 01:19:57.622
Here are the broad points.

01:19:58.082 --> 01:20:06.485
One, HMH in their letter acknowledged that higher than normal volume of corrections, but classify the majority of errors incorrectly as errata.

01:20:07.026 --> 01:20:20.631
We have analyzed their changes utilizing the definitions of California Code of Regulations, Title 5 Education, 5 CCR Section 9510H and R. Our analysis finds that their claims are not only inaccurate, but they are misleading.

01:20:21.221 --> 01:20:26.544
We have provided a grade-wise data with severity of changes that clarifies much higher volume of major changes.

01:20:26.664 --> 01:20:33.088
In our analysis, we found that 26% or 946 of changes that they submitted were significant changes.

01:20:34.909 --> 01:20:35.169
Thank you.

01:20:41.153 --> 01:20:41.573
Good morning.

01:20:42.914 --> 01:20:46.256
I'm Shankar, and I am a resident of Brea, California.

01:20:47.407 --> 01:20:53.829
HMH's drafts are blatantly racist, stereotypical, and show how Hinduism is inferior to other religions.

01:20:54.750 --> 01:21:02.512
Even the changes that were submitted were incomplete, where the edits talk of replacements but don't tell full details of what the replacements are going to be.

01:21:03.313 --> 01:21:08.674
No publisher content can be allowed based on a promise of change when the content itself is not known.

01:21:09.535 --> 01:21:15.857
The handful corrections for the Hinduism and Ancient India section fail to even address the violations of Category 1.

01:21:17.239 --> 01:21:27.168
Hence, we ask you to recommend the rejection of HMHS 6-8 program as recommended by Instructional Quality Commission.

01:21:27.448 --> 01:21:28.569
Thank you very much for listening.

01:21:34.161 --> 01:21:34.541
Namaste.

01:21:34.781 --> 01:21:35.621
I am Ashutosh.

01:21:35.741 --> 01:21:43.103
I am a father of a son who is born and raised, being raised in Mountain View.

01:21:43.663 --> 01:21:51.045
And I wanted to bring, I'm part of the Hindu Education Foundation, and I wanted to bring your attention to the hundreds of parents and children that are outside.

01:21:51.105 --> 01:21:53.146
It's raining outside, but they are here with

01:21:54.327 --> 01:21:57.749
with a sense of urgency because this is their last chance to get heard.

01:21:57.869 --> 01:22:06.256
The books that you publish, the resources that California Board of Education has, many of the other states in the country do not have those same resources.

01:22:06.296 --> 01:22:11.941
So the books that you publish are read not only in California but in other states in America.

01:22:12.361 --> 01:22:20.884
So this is a sense of urgency from many of the parents across the states and people have driven here from all the way to San Diego.

01:22:21.005 --> 01:22:22.325
They have been driving since yesterday.

01:22:22.665 --> 01:22:36.391
I really want to bring this to your attention that the hinduphobic edits and the hinduphobic content that Harcourt has been pushing for and that should be rejected and the voice of these children and parents should be heard.

01:22:36.591 --> 01:22:36.871
Thank you.

01:22:41.001 --> 01:22:41.441
Good morning.

01:22:42.242 --> 01:22:43.463
My name is Jagish Parikh.

01:22:43.824 --> 01:22:47.787
My son, Dvij Parikh, is a second grader at Fremont Unified School District.

01:22:48.408 --> 01:22:53.573
We live in a very diverse multicultural world where the Bay Area is a shining example of it.

01:22:54.113 --> 01:23:03.742
It is imperative that the goal of structured education everywhere should be to promote and foster friendship and unity among children of all color, race, religion, and sect.

01:23:04.506 --> 01:23:13.894
I was a little bit dismayed when I saw the current draft single out Hinduism for all the negative portrayal while other religions are presented in a very sensitive manner.

01:23:14.474 --> 01:23:17.357
There are clear laws and educational code sections.

01:23:18.283 --> 01:23:23.085
detailing a neutral, bias-free representation of all religions.

01:23:23.705 --> 01:23:33.790
I fully support IQC's decision to reject HMH K-6 and 6-8 textbooks, which have the worst content on Hinduism.

01:23:34.470 --> 01:23:45.375
I ask and request the board to reject other books like McGraw-Hill and National Geographic, which are equally worse, so that our future generations are taught the virtues of respect.

01:23:45.735 --> 01:23:46.055
Thank you.

01:23:55.677 --> 01:23:57.860
Good morning, respected SPE members.

01:23:58.521 --> 01:24:02.566
My name is Sumad Basavapatna from Shiboya Middle School in San Jose, California.

01:24:02.986 --> 01:24:03.907
I'm a seventh grader there.

01:24:03.927 --> 01:24:10.175
I was here in September for the IQC hearing and I was quite happy to hear the rejection of the HMH textbook drafts.

01:24:10.956 --> 01:24:14.839
These drafts had only demeaning depictions of the Hindu religion and of India.

01:24:15.319 --> 01:24:23.704
There is no mention of positive aspects like yoga, medicine, contributions to science, math, astronomy, metallurgy, and Hindu female deities.

01:24:24.104 --> 01:24:31.089
Such glaring omissions are impossible unless the authors are driven by hatred, prejudice, and Hinduphobia.

01:24:31.909 --> 01:24:44.512
And someone tries to condense many thousands of years of Hindu history into a dozen or so pages and attempts using such material to introduce Hinduism, they're liable to go astonishingly wrong in a disrespectful way.

01:24:45.092 --> 01:24:50.754
California's education system mandates a balanced perspective, and the HMH drafts do not do so.

01:24:51.294 --> 01:24:55.235
I request the SBE to reject HMH textbooks.

01:24:55.495 --> 01:24:58.756
Please also accept the changes penned by Professor Long and other academics.

01:24:58.976 --> 01:25:00.700
to fulfill law code 51501.

01:25:00.961 --> 01:25:02.104
Thank you for your time and patience.

01:25:11.792 --> 01:25:19.116
Respected board members, my name is Raviteja Pillamari and I'm an 8th grader studying in Kennedy Middle School and from Cooper Junior School District.

01:25:19.716 --> 01:25:23.338
And I'm here because of the misrepresentation of Hinduism in the textbooks.

01:25:23.798 --> 01:25:31.782
And because of this about 1 in 8 respondents of a bullying survey on Hindu American students said that their teachers made sarcastic remarks about Hinduism in front of the entire class.

01:25:32.383 --> 01:25:40.287
A student quoted in the report says, after being made fun of by my friends I didn't tell anybody else I was Hindu so I don't experience problems so much as I feel awkward sometimes.

01:25:41.087 --> 01:25:43.388
Others reported deep emotional scars from bullying incidents.

01:25:44.068 --> 01:25:50.930
And the purpose of standards is to project the cultural diversity of society, instilling in each child a sense of pride in his or her heritage.

01:25:51.310 --> 01:25:53.950
This is not how I felt when I was learning about Hinduism.

01:25:54.451 --> 01:25:56.631
I felt sad that this was how my culture was.

01:25:56.971 --> 01:25:59.072
This is how my culture was represented in the textbooks.

01:25:59.452 --> 01:26:02.913
And this is how my classmates, peers, and friends also felt.

01:26:02.933 --> 01:26:05.273
I want the board to reject the HMH textbooks.

01:26:05.754 --> 01:26:07.394
Respected board members, thank you for listening to my speech.

01:26:12.887 --> 01:26:17.109
Good morning, respected members of the State Board of Education.

01:26:17.129 --> 01:26:18.429
I am Sunita Gupta.

01:26:19.150 --> 01:26:27.633
The edits that frozen Hindu phobia group South Asian History is suggesting seems to be driven by hate.

01:26:28.113 --> 01:26:33.356
They are requesting to add more caste into the textbook, even thought

01:26:34.596 --> 01:26:36.738
caste from more than 30 percent.

01:26:37.458 --> 01:26:49.406
Of contents in section of Hinduism and Ascent India in all textbooks, no other section discuss social structure of civilization in such details.

01:26:50.366 --> 01:26:59.612
This is willful destruction of fact and will have severely adverse effect on Hindu and other children as well.

01:27:00.959 --> 01:27:08.102
The change that they suggested will not only lead to Category 1 violation.

01:27:08.542 --> 01:27:16.006
I hope that you will see increases and hateful motives of these edits and reject them.

01:27:16.186 --> 01:27:16.606
Thank you.

01:27:22.714 --> 01:27:27.419
Respected SBE members, my name is Shivani Kanth and I'm an 8th grader in Miller Middle School.

01:27:28.019 --> 01:27:34.546
In 6th grade, I was excited that I was going to learn about Hinduism, but I was greatly disappointed upon the information in the textbooks.

01:27:35.444 --> 01:27:39.186
The information was focused on the negatives and not the immense positives in my religion.

01:27:39.846 --> 01:27:45.868
My parents teach me about my culture and the information in the textbooks contradicting everything that was taught by my parents.

01:27:46.668 --> 01:27:50.430
The material in the textbooks is false and focused on the negatives in my culture.

01:27:51.070 --> 01:27:54.892
Learning from these textbooks at school hurt my pride of being an Indian American.

01:27:55.712 --> 01:28:03.954
I'm outraged that the textbooks such as HMH, National Geographic, and McGraw-Hill choose to focus on the negatives of my religion instead of its immense positives.

01:28:04.555 --> 01:28:12.397
While I thank IQC for rejecting HMH K-6 and 6-8, I urge you to support IQC's decision and keep her court rejected.

01:28:12.737 --> 01:28:12.997
Thank you.

01:28:15.851 --> 01:28:19.417
We are currently listening to speakers 50 through 75.

01:28:20.999 --> 01:28:28.070
If you have one of those numbers and are not currently in the boardroom, please line up so that you can make your presentation.

01:28:28.170 --> 01:28:28.511
Thank you.

01:28:34.178 --> 01:28:39.322
Respected members of State Board of Education, my name is Snehalata, and I'm coming from Fremont.

01:28:39.883 --> 01:28:44.767
I thank and fully support the decision of IQC to reject two programs of HMH.

01:28:45.267 --> 01:28:54.836
These programs are worst of all, and even after the huge number of revisions and rewrites submitted at the last minute, which collectively do not even address all the problems.

01:28:55.416 --> 01:29:01.860
Even HMHS, hundreds of revisions are incomplete, as they have promised to replace some context.

01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:04.981
They have not even said what those replacement would be.

01:29:05.401 --> 01:29:09.464
How would the draft textbook could be adopted when it is not even complete?

01:29:10.004 --> 01:29:13.626
Is HMH expecting this process to last for another 10 years?

01:29:14.306 --> 01:29:15.727
What about the taxpayers' money?

01:29:16.027 --> 01:29:17.048
And what about the children?

01:29:17.308 --> 01:29:18.629
And what about the process itself?

01:29:19.429 --> 01:29:23.932
Hence, I ask you to reject HMS2 programs as recommended by IQC.

01:29:24.272 --> 01:29:25.292
Thank you for listening to me.

01:29:30.815 --> 01:29:33.337
Good morning, everyone, respected board members.

01:29:33.797 --> 01:29:37.159
My name is Vivek Jambakar, and I come from Irvine, California.

01:29:37.399 --> 01:29:39.881
And I have been a California resident since last 17 years.

01:29:40.801 --> 01:29:45.104
And I'm a proud father of an eighth grader and a third grader.

01:29:46.504 --> 01:30:00.291
I was really appalled by the biased views against Hinduism and Indian civilization being still making through the draft versions of some of the textbooks what our kids are going to learn in the future.

01:30:00.992 --> 01:30:10.957
And I am fully supporting Professor Long's letter, which he has drafted with his 38 academic friends.

01:30:11.817 --> 01:30:22.560
And I would like to really request you to reject the drafts from McGraw-Hill and the National Geographic, which are still making way.

01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:27.341
And I thank you for rejecting the draft from the HMH.

01:30:28.222 --> 01:30:28.502
Thank you.

01:30:28.902 --> 01:30:29.322
Appreciate it.

01:30:35.046 --> 01:30:36.167
Good morning, board members.

01:30:36.647 --> 01:30:37.668
This is Vishal Sharma.

01:30:37.728 --> 01:30:39.769
I'm from Orange County, Southern California.

01:30:40.990 --> 01:30:45.853
And my two kids, 10 and 6 years old, they go to Irvine schools.

01:30:47.514 --> 01:30:53.398
We drove almost last night to reach on time and to get this opportunity, so thanks for that.

01:30:56.385 --> 01:31:04.217
When I look at the picture, cow eating trash, I wonder when this misinterpretation will go.

01:31:05.098 --> 01:31:08.783
So really, really, that is very disturbing for me, my family, my friends.

01:31:10.202 --> 01:31:16.185
So I'm here to oppose the hatred against Hindus and Indians.

01:31:17.505 --> 01:31:24.728
And I fully support the decision of IQC to reject the two programs of HMH.

01:31:26.109 --> 01:31:31.991
And I sincerely request to reject HMH's two programs as recommended by IQC.

01:31:32.571 --> 01:31:38.274
And I support the letter by Jeffrey Long and 38 other distinguished academicians.

01:31:38.394 --> 01:31:38.654
Thank you.

01:31:45.307 --> 01:31:46.089
Good morning, members.

01:31:46.209 --> 01:31:49.876
My name is Deepak Mehrotra, father of two young kids from San Ramon, California.

01:31:50.697 --> 01:31:56.689
I'm here to ensure that the future of my kids studying in California does not entail bullying and hatred because they are Hindus or they are from India.

01:31:57.794 --> 01:32:06.041
I'm quite appalled to see some fringe Hindu phobic groups submitting to the board last minute things to stop these proceedings.

01:32:06.701 --> 01:32:15.869
I have here papers print out from social media which I'm going to submit to show you some of their core leaders thinking just so the board knows what kind of people are you dealing with.

01:32:17.304 --> 01:32:19.265
So this is that South Asian histories for all.

01:32:21.086 --> 01:32:31.353
One of the submissions here, again on social media recently, states, Hindus believe in monkeys and half elephants, unquote, alluding to our Hindu gods.

01:32:31.493 --> 01:32:32.453
Hate speech 101.

01:32:33.614 --> 01:32:42.079
Another printout here, ridiculing Hindu priests doing prayers for rain, calling them stupid, young, Indian, white, threaded, Brahmin, and vulgarities.

01:32:42.159 --> 01:32:43.300
I cannot speak in a public forum.

01:32:44.229 --> 01:32:51.680
More printouts supporting supporting Hindus getting hacked by communists in India and saying they deserve it.

01:32:53.062 --> 01:32:56.747
And similarly, communist Marxist leaders are being praised.

01:33:06.394 --> 01:33:08.375
Good morning members of the State Board of Education.

01:33:08.735 --> 01:33:12.478
My name is Leslie Conpol and I'm an 8th grader in Lawson Middle School in Cupertino.

01:33:12.978 --> 01:33:22.163
I'm here to express my concern about how derogatory and stereotypical content about our particular culture in textbooks has long lasting impact on the students.

01:33:22.664 --> 01:33:32.810
The students belonging to that culture are not able to understand and appreciate the richness of their own culture and end up and end up to develop inferiority complex about it.

01:33:33.550 --> 01:33:39.532
Students from other cultures form wrong impressions and ideas about them, and it severely hampers their learning process.

01:33:40.032 --> 01:33:44.513
It also encourages bullying and other bad behavior towards the students of the affected culture.

01:33:45.053 --> 01:33:52.095
Hence, it is very important for you to ensure that no hateful or biased materials finds its way into the new textbooks.

01:33:53.058 --> 01:34:05.168
I wholeheartedly support the recommendations made by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other accommodations to the board as they attempt to bring fairness and parity to the textbook contents regarding Hinduism and India.

01:34:05.528 --> 01:34:06.089
Thank you for listening.

01:34:09.847 --> 01:34:12.209
Good morning, respected members of the SBE.

01:34:12.429 --> 01:34:15.811
I am Vasmati, mother of the two girls, grew up in Indian culture.

01:34:16.272 --> 01:34:17.733
I am proud American Indian.

01:34:17.833 --> 01:34:25.178
Today, I am here to support Jeffrey Long and other academics who are seeking accuracy in our children's school textbooks.

01:34:25.559 --> 01:34:32.624
Children's textbooks should teach our kids unbiased and positive aspects of culture and history of Hindus and Indians.

01:34:33.164 --> 01:34:38.789
Negative aspects of Hindus lead to the hatred and bullying of the Hindu kids at the school.

01:34:39.170 --> 01:34:51.221
Hinduism, Indian culture, which taught tolerance, nonviolence, and dharma among different religions, Hindu, Muslim, Jewish, Christian, Zoroastrian, et cetera, lived together in India from centuries.

01:34:51.801 --> 01:35:04.550
And so I stand here as one of among hundreds of Hindus who speak today saying just one thing, stop hatred and misrepresentation of Hindu culture beliefs in children textbooks.

01:35:05.071 --> 01:35:11.956
Let's help our children grow strong and self-esteem who are future leaders makes our country great.

01:35:12.416 --> 01:35:13.657
Thank you for listening.

01:35:17.728 --> 01:35:18.129
Good morning.

01:35:18.169 --> 01:35:20.832
My name is Arvind Malik from the Sacramento area.

01:35:21.873 --> 01:35:24.837
For most of history, India was the wealthiest region of the world.

01:35:25.758 --> 01:35:31.064
In both ancient and medieval times, India represented about one-third of the world's economy.

01:35:31.485 --> 01:35:34.929
That's an even bigger share than the United States in the modern day.

01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:47.852
During the British colonial times, unfortunately, India turned from the world's richest country to one of its poorest countries, and racist colonial powers deliberately diminished Indian history and achievements.

01:35:48.392 --> 01:35:55.193
Unfortunately, many of the proposed textbook materials are following the same racist and colonial pattern that the British showed.

01:35:56.514 --> 01:36:04.615
Instead of showing Indian advancements in surgery, medicine, science, and math, they show ancient India as being poor and backward, which is very factually inaccurate,

01:36:05.235 --> 01:36:05.736
and unfair.

01:36:06.637 --> 01:36:07.839
It's demeaning and distressing.

01:36:08.059 --> 01:36:14.067
It's not consistent with California law and fairness and decency that we're all used to living in California.

01:36:14.087 --> 01:36:19.253
I would appeal to the panel to reject all such textbooks that use racist images and texts.

01:36:19.573 --> 01:36:19.834
Thank you.

01:36:25.097 --> 01:36:25.537
Good morning.

01:36:26.218 --> 01:36:30.282
My name is Kevin Cabrera, and I'm here today to speak wearing two hats.

01:36:31.123 --> 01:36:47.821
First, as a trained historian, I believe it is important to teach and educate our students on historical inquiry, analysis, interpretation of documents, and the idea that new information can shift a historical narrative.

01:36:49.423 --> 01:36:51.986
I stand here to speak about the Mendez et al.

01:36:52.046 --> 01:36:53.927
versus Westminster et al.

01:36:54.208 --> 01:36:54.788
court case.

01:36:55.989 --> 01:36:59.933
The school desegregation case occurred in Orange County in the 1940s.

01:37:01.154 --> 01:37:08.842
This landmark case ended school segregation in California and paved the way to ending school segregation nationally.

01:37:10.754 --> 01:37:16.981
While the historic framework recommends teaching this case, the narrative is of the Mendez family.

01:37:17.983 --> 01:37:28.375
Eliminating the narratives of the other four families involved, Ramirez, Guzman, Estrada, Palomino, and the respective school districts.

01:37:35.049 --> 01:37:40.411
Respected members of the State Board of Education, I am Preksha Deshpande from Sunnyvale.

01:37:41.051 --> 01:37:49.514
I want to bring to your notice that the edits which the fringe Hinduphobic group South Asian Histories for All is suggesting has factual inaccuracies.

01:37:50.254 --> 01:37:56.978
In their edits, they emphasize that the Jati system or what is better known as the caste system has existed only among Hindus.

01:37:57.558 --> 01:38:02.161
This is not true and the fact is that it has existed in Sikhs and Buddhists also.

01:38:02.961 --> 01:38:09.485
It is for this reason that the marginalized communities within Sikhs formed Ravidasi Gurudwaras in the first place.

01:38:10.325 --> 01:38:18.795
There is enough evidence in the Pali literature, which is a source of ancient Buddhist texts, that Buddha too condoned the Jati system in many ways.

01:38:19.616 --> 01:38:29.306
To press that it existed or exists only within Hindus is a blatant lie that religious fundamentalists within South Asian histories for all are perpetuating.

01:38:29.967 --> 01:38:38.930
The changes that they suggest will not only lead to Category 1 violation, especially Category 1.10, but also violation of the norms of social content.

01:38:39.630 --> 01:38:45.012
I urge you to reject the inaccuracies and save the children from the textbook, from hateful content.

01:38:45.472 --> 01:38:45.732
Thank you.

01:38:56.075 --> 01:39:00.901
Dear members of the State Board of Education, I am Rishita Rokaria, a sixth grader at St.

01:39:00.941 --> 01:39:02.142
Joseph Feller Elementary.

01:39:02.583 --> 01:39:06.087
I am highly flustered and alarmed about false pictures of modern India.

01:39:06.508 --> 01:39:08.630
In my class, we're learning about the caste system.

01:39:09.031 --> 01:39:13.156
My classmates happen to think that Hindus have an unfair belief in which each group has more.

01:39:13.556 --> 01:39:14.397
powers than others.

01:39:14.857 --> 01:39:17.459
Also, the textbook McGraw-Hill has two pictures.

01:39:17.559 --> 01:39:19.841
One is of ancient India, and the other is of modern India.

01:39:20.161 --> 01:39:21.362
I cannot tell the difference.

01:39:21.682 --> 01:39:22.503
Why, you ask?

01:39:22.783 --> 01:39:27.306
Because there is no difference, even though modern India should be displayed on a more higher level.

01:39:27.687 --> 01:39:30.569
In fact, India is one of the most developed countries in Asia.

01:39:30.929 --> 01:39:37.734
I highly support IQC's decision to reject MHMK K-6 and HMH 6-8 programs.

01:39:38.174 --> 01:39:42.658
I also acknowledge Professor Jeffrey and 38 other top academics.

01:39:42.999 --> 01:39:44.930
I approve you take all the recommendations.

01:39:45.071 --> 01:39:45.433
Thank you.

01:39:50.370 --> 01:39:51.251
Hi, good morning.

01:39:52.752 --> 01:40:00.117
Respected members of the State Board of Education, I am Saloni Rukaria, sixth grader parent and a teacher from Milpitas Unified School District.

01:40:00.777 --> 01:40:14.866
Fringe Hinduphobic group South Asian Histories for All is asking for removing or distorting content in the textbook that is present in the framework, including Hindu History of Harappa, which is on page 214 of 2016 HSS framework.

01:40:15.247 --> 01:40:18.509
Saraswati River, which is on line page 215, line 814 of framework.

01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:24.852
So, this would lead to violation of guidelines 1.2 of HSS adoption.

01:40:25.252 --> 01:40:27.573
Hence, all their changes need to be rejected.

01:40:27.774 --> 01:40:34.557
In one of the changes, they said that Harappan civilization is not mentioned in the framework, whereas it could be found at page 214.

01:40:35.397 --> 01:40:41.260
Their suggestions are full of errors and would lead to serious violations of category 1 of adoption guidelines.

01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:45.202
They have no backing by academics and are not even signed by anybody.

01:40:45.882 --> 01:40:52.486
So looking at the magnitude and adverse effect of the edits suggested by them, I earnestly appeal you to reject them.

01:40:52.746 --> 01:40:53.166
Thank you.

01:40:58.509 --> 01:41:03.211
Respected members of the SB, I'm Ram Rao and I'm an 8th grader at South Lake Middle School.

01:41:03.591 --> 01:41:10.375
My brother, a 6th grader, brought his history textbook home and as I was reading over it, I noticed that Hinduism was not accurately described.

01:41:10.815 --> 01:41:14.137
In some places, it was portrayed as an inferior religion to some others.

01:41:14.737 --> 01:41:23.180
It is my earnest request that you support the IQC in their rejection of HMH drafts and reject other drafts which have content not meeting the California framework.

01:41:23.620 --> 01:41:25.201
My reason for the request goes like this.

01:41:25.641 --> 01:41:30.923
Every one out of three Hindu American children have reported that they have been bullied based on religious beliefs and practices.

01:41:31.483 --> 01:41:36.008
Many children have said that this happened after the section on Hinduism in ancient India were taught in schools.

01:41:36.508 --> 01:41:44.757
I stand here in solidarity with all Hindu American children who have been bullied and who have to face discrimination in classroom.

01:41:44.957 --> 01:41:48.841
Therefore, I request you to reject bias drafts and stop this menace of bullying.

01:41:49.162 --> 01:41:49.462
Thank you.

01:41:55.916 --> 01:41:57.577
Respected board members, good morning.

01:41:58.518 --> 01:42:00.920
I'm Ankur Tyagi, working and living in Foster City.

01:42:01.561 --> 01:42:05.464
I wish to express my views on the negative portrayal of Indian culture and Hinduism.

01:42:06.465 --> 01:42:14.192
In these years, IQC, I believe, has indeed done a good job, and I thank and support them for canceling the two HMH programs.

01:42:14.793 --> 01:42:19.357
I'm shocked, however, that National Geographic, which completely ignored the new framework, has been approved.

01:42:20.318 --> 01:42:22.339
For example, it skips the core Hindu

01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:27.323
teachings, festivals, and tries to show Hindus as being primitive and dirty.

01:42:28.204 --> 01:42:33.248
It is prejudiced and racist to portray and associate dirty pictures with Hinduism.

01:42:34.409 --> 01:42:36.991
Nat Geo has submitted a document to CD with corrections.

01:42:37.932 --> 01:42:42.315
Their book should be adopted only if those proposed changes are accepted.

01:42:43.136 --> 01:42:51.262
I demand that all recommendations of academic coalition by Professor Geoffrey Long and 38 other top academics be accepted.

01:42:52.017 --> 01:42:55.249
Please let these kids have an opportunity to form an opinion of their own.

01:42:55.631 --> 01:42:55.891
Thank you.

01:43:03.570 --> 01:43:08.491
Respected board members I am Manasi Nekar and I am a sophomore at Westmont High School.

01:43:09.032 --> 01:43:11.692
I am here today to stand against bullying of Hindu teens.

01:43:12.172 --> 01:43:16.874
The negative portrayal of Hinduism in the textbook causes one in three teens to be bullied.

01:43:17.454 --> 01:43:20.435
As a teenager students like me try to find our identity.

01:43:21.035 --> 01:43:26.776
If students are being bullied for expressing their religion they grew up feeling embarrassed about their beliefs and identity.

01:43:27.437 --> 01:43:31.898
We want to build a nation with confident citizens rather than ones with low self-esteem.

01:43:32.558 --> 01:43:38.463
So please help teenagers like me by rejecting HMH's two programs as recommended by IQC.

01:43:39.283 --> 01:43:40.624
I have been here multiple times.

01:43:41.045 --> 01:43:43.406
Thank you IQC for letting our voices be heard.

01:43:43.426 --> 01:43:54.455
Respected members of California State Board of Education, good morning.

01:43:55.461 --> 01:43:57.842
My name is Prabhakar, president of Roseville.

01:43:58.262 --> 01:44:02.623
I am father of a son who is studying sixth grade in Roseville City School District.

01:44:03.683 --> 01:44:14.505
I am shocked and worried to see the inaccurate, biased, and discriminatory content about ancient India and Hinduism in his textbooks.

01:44:14.525 --> 01:44:19.086
I fully support the recommendation of the Instructional Quality Commission

01:44:19.775 --> 01:44:25.508
to reject the Harcourt textbook, but I would like you to do more to fix the problems.

01:44:27.188 --> 01:44:33.092
McGraw-Hill also has a lot of prejudicial and racist content.

01:44:33.772 --> 01:44:39.095
If McGraw-Hill does not accept the suggested corrections, please reject McGraw-Hill as well.

01:44:39.996 --> 01:44:49.682
I also demand that all the recommendations of Academic Coalition by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other academics be accepted.

01:44:50.902 --> 01:44:55.745
I stand here to oppose hatred against Indians and Hinduism.

01:44:55.865 --> 01:44:57.086
Thank you for your time.

01:45:01.248 --> 01:45:01.888
Hello everyone.

01:45:03.209 --> 01:45:04.049
My name is Vijaya.

01:45:04.089 --> 01:45:06.311
I'm from Irvine, Southern California.

01:45:06.371 --> 01:45:07.431
I'm a mother of two kids.

01:45:07.971 --> 01:45:15.015
First of all, I'm very much shocked to see how come in this country, which is known for the land of justice and equality,

01:45:17.056 --> 01:45:23.958
irrespective of any race and religion, some publishers like HMH are able to spread hatred and discrimination.

01:45:24.518 --> 01:45:35.340
So I strongly support the recommendations of IQC and I want this board to take the decision as soon as possible to make our kids' future bright.

01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:40.781
Because if the kids are not learning love, peace and harmony, which is

01:45:41.281 --> 01:45:43.002
already being taught in our culture.

01:45:43.423 --> 01:45:45.644
They are not spreading this in the world.

01:45:45.744 --> 01:45:53.330
So if we want to make this country bright, we have to ban these books and make the recommendations correct.

01:45:53.910 --> 01:45:54.611
Thank you so much.

01:45:59.274 --> 01:45:59.795
Good morning.

01:45:59.815 --> 01:46:01.476
I am Manas Ray.

01:46:02.177 --> 01:46:03.878
I live in Folsom, California.

01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:12.224
I have a very simple and humble appeal to the learned men and women who are framing this syllabus.

01:46:13.505 --> 01:46:31.797
Please help to stop poisoning the minds of the California school kids against a civilization, culture, and religion which has not radicalized a single soul still today to pick up a gun or truck to kill innocent people in California or USA.

01:46:32.853 --> 01:46:39.105
Not a single pastor or priest of this religion in USA have been accused of child abuse.

01:46:40.288 --> 01:46:43.053
So think positively of it and take action.

01:46:43.253 --> 01:46:43.855
You can do it.

01:46:44.656 --> 01:46:44.977
Thank you.

01:46:49.502 --> 01:46:49.942
Good morning.

01:46:50.783 --> 01:46:54.364
I am from what some people call low caste or backward class.

01:46:54.945 --> 01:46:59.707
My name is Hari, and I'm a senior vice president in a global financial institution in Los Angeles.

01:46:59.847 --> 01:47:02.588
I have two kids in the California system of education.

01:47:03.169 --> 01:47:05.490
My plea is to treat Hinduism fairly per law.

01:47:05.590 --> 01:47:05.930
Simple.

01:47:06.630 --> 01:47:14.314
Currently, I see a continuation of anthropological, orientalist, colonial narrative that the world has moved away from.

01:47:15.026 --> 01:47:27.352
The divide-and-conquer virus planted by the books written during the British colonial period is still being used by so-called scholars who do not practice Hinduism but rather take the easy road to scholarship by quoting from colonial writings.

01:47:27.812 --> 01:47:29.513
It just simply doesn't go away.

01:47:30.013 --> 01:47:37.257
I want to make it clear that the fringe Hinduphobic hate group South Asian Histories for All does not speak for me, a low-caste person so-called.

01:47:37.857 --> 01:47:47.809
They blatantly try to use caste to erase our history by removing sages and saints from lower caste background, Valmiki, Vyasa, Guru Ramdas, in the framework ground and also trying here.

01:47:49.050 --> 01:47:49.731
We need to stop.

01:47:50.031 --> 01:47:52.174
The coalition is just purely Hinduphobic.

01:47:52.194 --> 01:47:55.958
I would like to urge you to reject all the books written by HMS.

01:47:55.978 --> 01:47:56.259
Thank you.

01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:05.101
respected SB, and the concerned parent of the kids going to Cupertino schools.

01:48:06.062 --> 01:48:10.463
I fully support the decision of IQC to reject the two programs of HMH.

01:48:11.083 --> 01:48:18.986
While some other textbooks programs are good, but the HMH programs are blatantly racist, Hinduphobic, and the worst in the quality.

01:48:19.566 --> 01:48:28.989
There are numerous violations of Category 1 of the adoption guidelines, especially Category 1.10, which prohibits adverse reflection based on the religion and ethnicity.

01:48:29.589 --> 01:48:34.050
They also violate the California law, which prohibits religious discrimination.

01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:46.273
For example, both the HMH-6 and HMH-68 accurately show Buddhism and Sikhism as an improvement over Hinduism, which is a clear adverse reflection and violates Category 1.10 of the Adoption Guidelines.

01:48:46.893 --> 01:48:50.794
Hence, I ask you to reject the HMH-2 programs as recommended by the IQC.

01:48:51.174 --> 01:48:56.776
Else, I hold this board responsible for bigotry, discrimination, and hatred against Hinduism and India.

01:48:57.396 --> 01:48:57.616
Thank you.

01:49:02.745 --> 01:49:04.147
Hello, dear sir and madam.

01:49:05.048 --> 01:49:05.748
I am Dinesh Jha.

01:49:05.929 --> 01:49:06.930
I live in San Jose.

01:49:07.310 --> 01:49:09.473
I have two kids going to Aberdeen Elementary School.

01:49:10.985 --> 01:49:18.271
I support IQC's decision to reject HMH books for K-6 and 6-8, which have many violations.

01:49:19.572 --> 01:49:24.635
I support the recommendation made by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other academicians.

01:49:25.496 --> 01:49:26.917
Please accommodate all their changes.

01:49:27.497 --> 01:49:34.503
Further, I stand with the hundreds of Californians here to ask that McGraw-Hill drafts be rejected as well.

01:49:34.863 --> 01:49:37.585
These programs are blatantly racist and Hinduphobic.

01:49:38.025 --> 01:49:39.827
They have numerous violations of Category 1,

01:49:41.047 --> 01:49:48.632
adoption guidelines especially category 1.10 which prohibits adverse reflection based on the religion and ethnicity.

01:49:49.312 --> 01:50:01.079
How can I accept the baseless claim made by McGraw-Hill book in the 6th grade page 264 which says that Buddhism is an improvement over Hinduism as if Hinduism was defective.

01:50:01.539 --> 01:50:05.241
Further erroneously conveys that meditation was not part of Hinduism.

01:50:06.722 --> 01:50:07.543
Due to such violations?

01:50:08.284 --> 01:50:10.093
to accept Hinduism here.

01:50:10.133 --> 01:50:10.314
Thanks.

01:50:14.323 --> 01:50:15.204
Thank you, board members.

01:50:16.345 --> 01:50:17.445
My name is Rama Tubanti.

01:50:17.526 --> 01:50:19.387
I'm from Pleasanton.

01:50:19.687 --> 01:50:22.930
My kids go to Pleasanton Unified School District.

01:50:23.651 --> 01:50:32.078
And I'm here to fully support the IQC's decision to reject HMH K through 6 and then 6 to 8 programs.

01:50:33.199 --> 01:50:41.526
And also fully support Professor Geoffrey Long and then 38 other top academicians that recommended the changes.

01:50:43.327 --> 01:50:52.350
And the main point I would like to say is Hinduism is not a bad religion or anything.

01:50:52.570 --> 01:50:58.272
It teaches the way of life and truth to the world.

01:51:02.554 --> 01:51:13.702
So the Vedic scriptures and Hindu rituals all teach to love people, not only just humans, nature and animals and everything in the world.

01:51:15.343 --> 01:51:15.963
Please support.

01:51:22.495 --> 01:51:28.517
Respected members of State Board of Education, I am Chandra from Folsom, California, raising two kids in this state.

01:51:29.137 --> 01:51:37.360
Today I stand here to oppose negative aspects against Hindus and Indians in the 6th to 8th grade children's school textbooks.

01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:42.401
I thank and fully support the decision of IQC to reject the two programs of HMH.

01:51:43.161 --> 01:51:50.844
Even after the huge number of revisions and rewrites submitted at the last minute, which do not even address all the problems, HMH has to

01:51:51.984 --> 01:51:59.026
submit 4,600 edits collectively for their programs that just four days ahead of IQC's deadline.

01:51:59.546 --> 01:52:03.767
HMH itself has completely accepted that its books have huge problems.

01:52:04.267 --> 01:52:07.308
That is why they need such major changes and rewrites.

01:52:07.808 --> 01:52:16.150
Just for HMH 6th to 8th program, more than 100 revisions are complete, rewrites which is not allowed as per the adoption.

01:52:16.751 --> 01:52:20.865
Hence, I ask you to reject HMS2 programs as recommended by IQC.

01:52:21.266 --> 01:52:21.989
Thanks for listening.

01:52:22.149 --> 01:52:22.671
Thank you very much.

01:52:28.939 --> 01:52:35.324
Dear members of the State Board of Education, I'm Arul Verma and I'm a freshman currently attending the King's Academy in Sunnyvale.

01:52:35.904 --> 01:52:42.750
You probably did not know that one in every three Hindu American children are bullied because of the portrayal of my religion taught in classrooms.

01:52:43.230 --> 01:52:49.235
For example, HMHK through six and six to eight have pictures that show Hindus with trash as dirty.

01:52:49.755 --> 01:52:55.700
This caused a seventh grade student to be called a dirty Hindu by one of his classmates in a class lesson.

01:52:56.540 --> 01:53:01.184
I do not want to see any issue of bullying arising again because of a simple Hindu religion.

01:53:02.205 --> 01:53:14.476
Therefore, I commend IQC for rejecting two Hindu-phobic books that clearly show Hindus associated with trash as dirty, and I stand with all Hindu-American children that have been bullied because of biased textbooks.

01:53:14.976 --> 01:53:23.523
I also request that the recommendation of academic coalition with Jeffrey Long and 38 other top academics be accepted.

01:53:23.744 --> 01:53:24.024
Thank you.

01:53:30.017 --> 01:53:33.779
Dear members of the State Board of Education, my name is Monica Verma.

01:53:33.979 --> 01:53:37.922
I'm from San Jose and a concerned mother of two kids who are 9 and 14 years old.

01:53:38.742 --> 01:53:48.668
I would like to take this opportunity to express the shock and disagreement with some of the contents in public school books that misinterpret India's history and Hindu religion.

01:53:49.108 --> 01:53:56.193
It causes embarrassment to me, leaving little doubt how much bullying kids may have to face because of the inappropriate and derogatory content

01:53:56.733 --> 01:53:59.435
the books have on Hinduism and ancient culture of India.

01:53:59.995 --> 01:54:03.018
The religious and historical details are not very accurate.

01:54:03.498 --> 01:54:14.126
In addition to that, using modern day pictures to support it has no relevance to actual facts, hence degrading the quality of instructional material, which is wrongfully being imparted to the young minds.

01:54:14.506 --> 01:54:22.832
I would therefore request the board to please instruct the publishers to thoroughly verify the contents before putting them in any books, be it any area or topic.

01:54:23.332 --> 01:54:23.893
Thank you so much.

01:54:27.714 --> 01:54:28.614
Good morning, board members.

01:54:28.994 --> 01:54:29.734
My name is Kaushik.

01:54:29.754 --> 01:54:30.535
I'm a civil engineer.

01:54:30.655 --> 01:54:32.095
I'm a proud father of two kids.

01:54:32.895 --> 01:54:35.716
While walking in, I noticed a nice statement in the notice board.

01:54:35.736 --> 01:54:38.296
It says, healthy students create successful students.

01:54:38.796 --> 01:54:42.337
So we all understand that mental health is part of overall health.

01:54:43.077 --> 01:54:53.220
When this kind of material is published in the books, we know that it really impacts the mental health of a student because they are bullied.

01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:54.620
I have heard

01:54:55.479 --> 01:54:58.682
girls getting, Hindu girls being called as sniper dots.

01:54:59.182 --> 01:54:59.823
Can you believe it?

01:54:59.863 --> 01:55:03.946
In the schools, they are called sniper dots because they wear a Sindhu on their forehead.

01:55:05.607 --> 01:55:19.198
So if you see the global picture of this, when you take a kid, when you depress them so much, and also when you use such derogatory terms on the religion that is founded on principles of forgiveness and peace,

01:55:19.958 --> 01:55:21.380
It really depresses the student.

01:55:21.820 --> 01:55:29.609
Once we have a depressed student, we have a depressed society because we should all remember that school is the first society a child encounters.

01:55:31.151 --> 01:55:35.036
So I really request you guys to process this thing and thank you.

01:55:42.062 --> 01:55:42.543
Good morning.

01:55:42.643 --> 01:55:46.487
My name is Sheikha Saxena, and I'm a fifth grader from Elliott Ranch Elementary.

01:55:46.867 --> 01:55:49.970
I'm here to talk about how books are lying about our culture.

01:55:50.371 --> 01:55:53.334
California is one of the most diverse states in USA.

01:55:53.714 --> 01:55:57.598
Because of that, we have the responsibility to make every culture look good.

01:55:58.439 --> 01:56:02.641
But the Indian culture has been portrayed so it looks like a hot mess.

01:56:03.461 --> 01:56:11.665
One issue is that books keep bringing up bad terms about Indian culture like cows, cats, and curry.

01:56:12.085 --> 01:56:15.167
This leads to Indian kids getting bullied on stereotypes.

01:56:15.607 --> 01:56:19.849
This also leads to many lies that kids carry out throughout their life.

01:56:20.649 --> 01:56:26.986
All in all, I know your job is hard, but it's not an excuse for what is happening to Hinduism.

01:56:27.367 --> 01:56:28.670
Thank you very much for your time.

01:56:34.983 --> 01:56:39.525
Respected members of SBE, my name is Mahesh Kinnekar.

01:56:39.565 --> 01:56:43.607
I work for Stanford, and I'm here as a concerned father of two kids.

01:56:44.828 --> 01:56:53.873
We write you to address a letter submitted to the State Board of Education on November 1st by a group named South Asian Histories for All, or SAFA.

01:56:54.573 --> 01:57:04.598
The letter claims that the history social science framework is not being followed, amongst other defamatory comments and statements about Hindu American community.

01:57:05.262 --> 01:57:14.706
We take this opportunity to offer our observations on the changes that this group has suggested, as well as text that it cites as problematic in the textbook drafts.

01:57:15.446 --> 01:57:17.367
Our overall observations are as follows.

01:57:17.987 --> 01:57:26.811
In 32 of the 43 proposed revisions that SAHAFA has suggested, the original text from the textbook draft complies with what is mandated with the HSS framework.

01:57:27.902 --> 01:57:35.693
In most cases, the text is nearly identical to what is mandated by the framework document, while in others, the text is clearly included in order to comply with the framework.

01:57:36.475 --> 01:57:40.881
SAFA appears to be seeking directions and modifications of text that conforms to the framework.

01:57:45.796 --> 01:57:46.937
Good morning, SBE.

01:57:47.778 --> 01:57:51.441
Myself, Samruthi Zarkar, and I'll be continuing the speech.

01:57:51.822 --> 01:58:01.972
So two changes are based on old revisions of textbooks, drafts, and are thus moot, as either the publishers and or the Instructional Quality Commission have changed the text.

01:58:02.432 --> 01:58:05.335
None of the edits cite any scholarly references.

01:58:05.815 --> 01:58:22.011
Many of SAHFA's suggestions adversely reflect upon Hinduism, thereby placing several textbook drafts in jeopardy of violating Category 1.10 of the HSS Adoption Criteria and the Social Content Citations.

01:58:22.431 --> 01:58:23.392
Thanks for listening guys.

01:58:27.625 --> 01:58:28.106
Good morning.

01:58:28.366 --> 01:58:30.990
I'm Komar Tripasuri, continuing on to the same point there.

01:58:32.051 --> 01:58:42.264
Given the SIHF's contentions about erasure of history, it is indeed ironic that nine of the total 43 edits call for deletions of content from the textbook drafts.

01:58:42.985 --> 01:58:48.511
They even suggest a deletion of significant portion of the section on Hinduism in one of the textbooks.

01:58:49.091 --> 01:58:57.680
While they claim to talk for the lower castes, we do not see any of their edits, any suggestions to add the cultural or religious contributions of lower castes.

01:58:58.540 --> 01:59:06.526
It is rather because of the efforts of HEF that Hindu sages and saints from so-called lower castes were included in the framework in 2016.

01:59:07.246 --> 01:59:25.698
We thus respectfully request the State Board of Education to reject these suggested revisions as they're not academically or historically sound, contradict the HSS framework, and would lead to gross violations of the HSS textbook adoption criteria, as well as numerous social content criteria.

01:59:25.899 --> 01:59:26.239
Thank you.

01:59:31.641 --> 01:59:36.524
Respected members of the State Board of Education, I am Deepna Sarkar from Fremont.

01:59:37.205 --> 01:59:43.649
I stand here to support IQC's decision to reject HMH books for K-6 and 6-8.

01:59:44.990 --> 01:59:50.894
My biggest anxiety is the way my culture and civilization are inaccurately portrayed in the textbooks.

01:59:51.895 --> 02:00:01.324
It had been a very contradicting sixth grade of history science as I was forced to write incorrect notations against my will when I knew all along that it was wrong.

02:00:02.125 --> 02:00:06.369
I was excited that all of it was going to change when the new textbooks came.

02:00:07.029 --> 02:00:10.252
However, they're even worse than the previous books.

02:00:11.234 --> 02:00:22.055
Accurate instructional materials can certainly be one of the factors in mitigating anti-Hindu bias and bullying, while helping to create safe learning environments for all students.

02:00:22.235 --> 02:00:22.576
Thank you.

02:00:26.553 --> 02:00:28.875
Good morning, dear members of the State Board of Education.

02:00:29.215 --> 02:00:32.437
I am Praveen Tamar, parent of two children studying in Irvine.

02:00:33.018 --> 02:00:36.460
I stand here to oppose hatred against Hindus and Hinduism.

02:00:37.001 --> 02:00:43.886
I support the recommendation of academic coalition by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other top academics.

02:00:44.406 --> 02:00:50.570
I fully support IQC's decision to reject HMH K-6 and HMH 6-8 programs.

02:00:51.131 --> 02:00:52.151
But that's not enough.

02:00:52.612 --> 02:00:58.396
Books by National Geographic, McGraw Hill, contain many of the same errors and misrepresentations.

02:00:59.056 --> 02:01:04.740
They don't meet the standards set by content framework, violate California law in many categories.

02:01:05.220 --> 02:01:05.881
Only Hinduism

02:01:06.855 --> 02:01:11.039
is presented in negative manners with tags and references of social issues.

02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:15.764
Social issues exist in all human societies, comprising all the religions.

02:01:16.145 --> 02:01:19.748
Why mislead kids that social issues exist only in Hinduism?

02:01:20.049 --> 02:01:20.329
Thank you.

02:01:26.294 --> 02:01:26.854
Namaste.

02:01:27.214 --> 02:01:29.375
I am Aparina Basavapatna from San Jose.

02:01:29.755 --> 02:01:30.575
I am an eighth grader.

02:01:31.115 --> 02:01:35.236
I stand here today to oppose hatred against Hindus and Indians.

02:01:36.037 --> 02:01:40.878
I fully support the IQC board's decision to reject the HMH history program.

02:01:41.378 --> 02:01:48.700
These faulty publications degrade Hinduism by including pictures of caricatures representing Hindu deities.

02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:53.781
They even show Indians with trash signifying that they are dirty.

02:01:54.902 --> 02:01:55.502
This picture.

02:01:56.949 --> 02:01:58.230
It's not fair.

02:01:59.131 --> 02:02:01.192
These books are biased.

02:02:02.353 --> 02:02:08.478
Until and unless they're driven by utmost contempt, how could anybody write such discriminating books?

02:02:09.079 --> 02:02:14.703
How could these books promote self-esteem and enable a safe, respectful, and welcoming environment in our schools?

02:02:15.384 --> 02:02:22.849
They have many violations of Category 1 and 1.10, which prohibits adverse reflection based on religion and race.

02:02:23.630 --> 02:02:26.952
I really ask you to incorporate Professor Long's work into use.

02:02:27.353 --> 02:02:31.856
Let us not deprive California of what it needs, and thank you for your time and patience.

02:02:36.906 --> 02:02:40.167
Good morning, respected members of the State Board of Education.

02:02:40.407 --> 02:02:45.488
I am Sunita, mother of two kids studying in 6th and 10th grade, Cupertino School District.

02:02:45.868 --> 02:02:52.029
I'm extremely shocked by seeing the textbooks in California, which portray inaccurate Indian history and Hinduism.

02:02:52.489 --> 02:03:00.571
I appreciate IQC's decision to reject HMH because the textbooks are Hindu phobia, but rejecting HMH is not alone enough.

02:03:01.091 --> 02:03:05.874
National Geographic has excluded newly added sections from 2016 framework.

02:03:06.335 --> 02:03:09.897
National Geographic has submitted a document to the CDE with corrections.

02:03:10.618 --> 02:03:15.461
So these books should be adopted only if these changes are reflected in their textbooks.

02:03:15.981 --> 02:03:23.066
I also request you to accept the recommendations of the academic coalition by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other top academics.

02:03:23.467 --> 02:03:23.947
Thanking you.

02:03:28.769 --> 02:03:29.289
Good morning.

02:03:29.670 --> 02:03:32.731
I am Samita Tripasiri from San Ramon, California.

02:03:33.111 --> 02:03:35.973
I am here today opposing the hatred towards Hindus and Indians.

02:03:36.473 --> 02:03:39.215
Many Indian students throughout California are being bullied.

02:03:39.595 --> 02:03:44.077
The reason is because Hinduism is being portrayed incorrectly in the California textbooks.

02:03:44.578 --> 02:03:48.280
What I mean by this is that the publishers are misrepresenting our culture.

02:03:48.660 --> 02:03:56.064
I agree there are negative aspects to many religions and cultures throughout the world, but the publishers seem to highlight and exaggerate the Hindu religion the most.

02:03:56.724 --> 02:03:59.205
As I mentioned, bullying happens a lot because of the textbooks.

02:03:59.745 --> 02:04:09.468
One of several bullying incidents states that, I was at lunch and it was after we learned about Hinduism, they started saying my religion is the devil's religion and that I will go to hell.

02:04:09.888 --> 02:04:12.108
This clearly points out the problems with the textbooks.

02:04:12.549 --> 02:04:16.850
I urge the board to reject all material that has hatred against Hindus and every other community.

02:04:17.230 --> 02:04:17.550
Thank you.

02:04:24.980 --> 02:04:25.441
Good morning.

02:04:25.682 --> 02:04:26.645
My name is Swati.

02:04:27.046 --> 02:04:30.054
I support IQC's suggestion to reject HMH draft.

02:04:30.996 --> 02:04:34.497
Weird But True is the name of National Geographic book series.

02:04:35.078 --> 02:04:44.662
Just like the name Weird But True, National Geographic has failed to mention Hindu contributions to the world, like concept of zero, yoga and meditation.

02:04:45.222 --> 02:04:48.703
They have disregarded the new framework, so please reject their draft.

02:04:49.223 --> 02:04:53.565
McGraw-Hill has failed to accept many edits from Professor Long and his team.

02:04:54.205 --> 02:04:58.147
If these recommendations are not included, please reject McGraw-Hill draft.

02:04:58.707 --> 02:05:01.389
Today, sadly, we are witnessing mass shootings.

02:05:02.029 --> 02:05:06.853
In this social media age, messages of hate are thrown at us from all directions.

02:05:07.573 --> 02:05:12.056
Respected members, the root cause of this hate is disinformation.

02:05:12.977 --> 02:05:25.765
Therefore, it is very critical at this point to stop publishers from spreading disinformation and to prevent publishers from planting seeds of hate against Hindu culture in young minds.

02:05:26.186 --> 02:05:26.906
Thank you very much.

02:05:27.807 --> 02:05:28.147
Namaste.

02:05:35.031 --> 02:05:39.754
Respected members of the State Board of Education, I'm Rakesh Wagh from Foster City.

02:05:40.214 --> 02:05:42.796
I stand here to oppose hatred against Hindus and Indians.

02:05:43.336 --> 02:05:49.320
IQC has shown the courage to reject hatred and prejudice by rejecting two Hinduphobic books so far.

02:05:50.200 --> 02:05:55.465
We request SBE also to reject all hateful content, some of which is in other books.

02:05:56.066 --> 02:06:04.894
Textbooks should be tool to formulate positive thoughts in young minds, and not the place for hatred, politics, or propagating nefarious agenda.

02:06:05.695 --> 02:06:15.678
These formality years for kids should be in learning and appreciating the positive contributions of various civilizations and not fed with a cocktail of hatred and prejudice.

02:06:16.218 --> 02:06:21.640
I support the recommendation by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other academicians.

02:06:22.120 --> 02:06:24.241
Please consider them incomplete.

02:06:24.381 --> 02:06:24.661
Thank you.

02:06:31.212 --> 02:06:36.014
Respected members of State Board of Education, my name is Harkini Wagh.

02:06:36.374 --> 02:06:39.915
I'm a 5th grader from Brewer Island Elementary School, Foster City.

02:06:40.015 --> 02:06:46.877
I have heard stories from some of my 6th and 7th grade Indian origin friends about how they were bullied in school for being a Hindu.

02:06:47.598 --> 02:06:53.780
I'm worried that I will have to suffer the same fate because the textbooks incorrectly portray my religion as inferior.

02:06:54.720 --> 02:07:02.362
My religion never taught me to have negative prejudice against somebody who follows another way of life or prays to another form of God.

02:07:02.742 --> 02:07:09.163
And I expect the SPE will present Hinduism with equal respect as it has shown to other religions.

02:07:09.803 --> 02:07:14.944
Fighting with my classmates on whose religion is superior is the last thing I want to do in middle school.

02:07:15.425 --> 02:07:16.885
Can you please fix those textbooks?

02:07:17.025 --> 02:07:17.385
Thank you.

02:07:27.287 --> 02:07:31.356
honorable members of the Department of Education of the State of California.

02:07:32.658 --> 02:07:38.223
I am Ramakrishna Swamy, a Hindu saint and religious leader from Modesto, California.

02:07:39.605 --> 02:07:57.962
In Hinduism and Indian culture, the social classification of mankind, firstly into the quadruple category of intellectuals or Brahmins, secondly into warriors and administrative statesmen or Kshatriyas, thirdly into mercantile businesspersons or Vaishyas,

02:07:58.622 --> 02:08:11.151
And fourthly, into laborers, peasants, and shudras cannot beget any hatred or injustice for the reason that any civilization cannot function at all without such classes in society.

02:08:11.811 --> 02:08:18.255
Even Roman and Greek civilizations had such classes based either hereditarily or occupationally.

02:08:18.816 --> 02:08:24.840
Even now, such classifications exist in the modern global society with paraphrased labels.

02:08:25.740 --> 02:08:28.122
I have a lot more to say, which I will give in writing.

02:08:28.944 --> 02:08:34.298
And I second the move initiated by Professor Jeffrey Long.

02:08:34.559 --> 02:08:34.880
Thank you.

02:08:43.035 --> 02:08:46.696
Dear Board of Education, my name is Anish Dara.

02:08:47.236 --> 02:08:50.137
I'm a fifth grader from KC, Foster City.

02:08:50.897 --> 02:08:55.278
We are very appraising of your decision to reject a sixth grade textbook.

02:08:55.798 --> 02:09:02.860
However, a few other books are making Hindu children uncomfortable in their schools and sometimes even neighborhoods.

02:09:03.680 --> 02:09:07.621
They show irrelative topics rather than the sacred cities in India.

02:09:08.444 --> 02:09:15.430
Hopefully, you understand that the books are illegally passing off bad information about the Indian civilization.

02:09:16.551 --> 02:09:24.077
On my vacations to India, I have not seen any of this fake news except occasionally, but again, that is cited everywhere.

02:09:25.358 --> 02:09:30.142
Good qualities such as yoga and eating healthy food is never shown in anything.

02:09:30.983 --> 02:09:33.705
Hindu students are being bullied in day-to-day life.

02:09:34.145 --> 02:09:36.849
and my friends in sixth grade feel the pain.

02:09:37.450 --> 02:09:42.538
Next year I will be undergoing the same taunts as the middle schoolers.

02:09:43.138 --> 02:09:47.825
We should have a society with the racial free harmony rather than bullying.

02:09:48.246 --> 02:09:50.149
Thank you for listening to my presentation.

02:09:55.868 --> 02:09:57.869
respected members of board.

02:09:58.590 --> 02:10:08.056
I'm here, my name is Gautam Khandelwal and I'm here to support IQC's courageous decision to reject two programs of HMH.

02:10:08.896 --> 02:10:21.244
And I say that because respected members, our, this great land of America is known for its innovation and science and technology, freedom of speech.

02:10:21.884 --> 02:10:24.106
We are the oldest democracy in the world.

02:10:24.941 --> 02:10:41.832
But think about it, if some science book doesn't teach all this, and instead of it, it teaches the Civil War, Native American suppression, this Iraq War, Vietnam War, what kind of impression that book will create on the student's brain?

02:10:42.772 --> 02:10:47.095
Unfortunately, that's what HMH is doing with Indian and Indian civilization.

02:10:47.635 --> 02:10:52.237
It is only talking about caste and all similar social evils.

02:10:52.977 --> 02:10:58.360
So my sincere request to this board is that please reject those programs.

02:10:58.620 --> 02:11:01.341
I demand dignity for India over hatred.

02:11:01.541 --> 02:11:01.881
Thank you.

02:11:09.304 --> 02:11:10.545
I am Professor Keshav Patel.

02:11:12.815 --> 02:11:22.577
representing Vishwa Hindu Parishad of America, and Vishwa Hindu Parishad India, as well as Hindu University of America.

02:11:24.517 --> 02:11:25.858
I'm from La Palma City.

02:11:26.578 --> 02:11:38.460
I'm very much thankful to you for giving this opportunity to make some corrections, whatever is required in our textbook, California State textbooks, which is not written in a proper way.

02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:49.851
Being a professor and trustee, I am shocked at the hatred against India and the Hindu culture shown in the California State Textbook.

02:11:50.632 --> 02:12:00.903
I reject it and request you to make necessary changes for the sake of students and the bright future of the young generation.

02:12:01.924 --> 02:12:09.972
I fully support the IQC's decision and reject the HMHK 628 program.

02:12:10.632 --> 02:12:21.002
And I also support the recommendations of academic coalitions by Professor Geoffrey Long and 38 other top academics.

02:12:22.424 --> 02:12:22.664
Okay.

02:12:30.984 --> 02:12:32.305
Good morning, members of the board.

02:12:32.585 --> 02:12:35.308
My name is Murugan Krishnan, coming from Orange County.

02:12:36.008 --> 02:12:37.990
I've been living in this country over 20 years.

02:12:38.530 --> 02:12:44.775
When I talk to my other non-Hindu friends, I ask them, when you say India or Hinduism, what comes to your mind?

02:12:45.276 --> 02:12:49.439
They tell me vegetarian, yoga, guru system, those kind of things.

02:12:49.840 --> 02:12:56.025
When we read the history books here, all we see is monkeys and cows eating dirt, those kind of portrayal.

02:12:56.505 --> 02:12:59.888
We are one of the only religions celebrate women as a goddess.

02:13:00.208 --> 02:13:01.948
But those kind of things are not mentioned.

02:13:02.609 --> 02:13:04.929
Other religions, we treat all the religions equally.

02:13:05.289 --> 02:13:08.690
We treat Buddhists and Sikhs as brothers and sisters.

02:13:09.230 --> 02:13:18.213
But in this book, K6 and K6-8, it is said that Sikhism and Buddhism as an improvement over Hinduism.

02:13:18.713 --> 02:13:21.998
It is kind of a divide and conquer these publishers are doing.

02:13:22.018 --> 02:13:24.721
This is comparing one religion over another.

02:13:24.741 --> 02:13:26.083
I don't know whether it's a good practice.

02:13:26.684 --> 02:13:34.954
And so I just want all of you to support these programs and do the right thing, do a dignity for India, and do some good representation.

02:13:34.994 --> 02:13:35.275
Thank you.

02:13:39.793 --> 02:13:40.654
Namaste, board members.

02:13:41.334 --> 02:13:42.335
This is Mayuresh Dhani.

02:13:42.435 --> 02:13:56.207
I work at Redwood City, but I'm not there at work because I want to make children of my future so that they have, you know, they should be

02:13:58.319 --> 02:14:02.000
proud of their Indian culture, which I see not happening.

02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:19.106
I've been in this country only for about two years, but what I see is that there's a racial hatred and prejudice against Hindus predominantly, which I don't want to be happening.

02:14:19.826 --> 02:14:20.306
This might

02:14:21.275 --> 02:14:41.650
this might be because of the National Geographic learning, you know, the framework which was bypassed and the core Hindu teachings and festivals, they were also tried to be showed as dirty, which is not true.

02:14:43.291 --> 02:14:48.595
So I just demand that the academic coalition is, okay, sorry.

02:14:59.298 --> 02:14:59.438
Yeah.

02:15:00.258 --> 02:15:02.159
Hello, my name is Samrat Jaka.

02:15:02.499 --> 02:15:03.860
I'm going to sixth grade next year.

02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:10.283
I have heard from my brother about the previous issues he experienced while going through the India chapter in his sixth grade.

02:15:10.743 --> 02:15:15.965
He is a victim of teasing and bullying due to the improper explanations in the book of our culture.

02:15:16.385 --> 02:15:17.766
I don't want that to happen to me.

02:15:18.226 --> 02:15:21.527
Looking at the frameworks, my culture is shown very badly in some of them.

02:15:22.007 --> 02:15:25.549
My culture is not shown as nicely as other cultures are shown.

02:15:26.576 --> 02:15:29.617
They are showing us they are better than Indian Hinduism.

02:15:30.077 --> 02:15:30.777
That's not right.

02:15:31.518 --> 02:15:33.418
A lot of the information is wrong and negative.

02:15:34.038 --> 02:15:38.980
For example, this picture has a farm man and monkey, but the topic is Maurya Empire.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.141
How does this even relate to the empire?

02:15:42.101 --> 02:15:47.183
Please reject the HMH frameworks and use the recommendations by Mr. Long and 38 others.

02:15:47.543 --> 02:15:47.863
Thank you.

02:15:59.522 --> 02:16:03.244
Respected members of State Board of Education, I'm Sri Lakshmi.

02:16:03.344 --> 02:16:04.504
I'm coming from Foster City.

02:16:04.904 --> 02:16:11.267
I'm a mother of two kids, like 10 and 7, and I'm here to oppose the hatred against Hindus and Indians.

02:16:11.887 --> 02:16:16.449
I fully support the decision of IQC to reject the two programs of HMH.

02:16:16.829 --> 02:16:24.953
These programs are blatantly racist, hateful, and against LGBTQ community and very poor in quality.

02:16:25.313 --> 02:16:34.798
They have numerous violations of Category 1 of adoption rules, especially Category 1.10, which prohibits adverse reflection based on religion and ethnicity.

02:16:35.419 --> 02:16:44.344
For example, in a blatantly racist depiction, it shows Indian laborers working alongside monkeys and thereby equating Indians with monkeys.

02:16:44.944 --> 02:16:50.389
This is really disrespectful for the farmers who feed all the families.

02:16:50.730 --> 02:17:00.299
And me coming from the farmer's family, like my ancestors, my parents, my grandparents and forefathers are from farmer's background.

02:17:00.539 --> 02:17:04.082
I really feel like I'm disrespectful for that.

02:17:04.182 --> 02:17:05.484
And thank you very much for your time.

02:17:05.584 --> 02:17:05.864
Thank you.

02:17:10.205 --> 02:17:11.666
Respecting members of the board.

02:17:12.007 --> 02:17:12.567
Namaste.

02:17:12.587 --> 02:17:17.291
Namaste means a gesture where the acknowledgement of the soul in one to the soul in another.

02:17:17.311 --> 02:17:20.074
Hopefully the soul of a student will be acknowledged.

02:17:20.674 --> 02:17:27.760
I'm Dhwani Maru a sixth grader started a new phase at Monroe Middle School with all new friends new studies and new teachers.

02:17:28.481 --> 02:17:34.987
But this summer I read the history textbooks for the coming next 10 academic years which made me feel low in esteem

02:17:35.427 --> 02:17:39.211
seeing my motherland India and disgrace of its culture and Hinduism.

02:17:39.932 --> 02:17:46.459
I am worried that my friends will make joke on my country and its religion, and they would start bullying me by keeping names.

02:17:47.019 --> 02:17:50.883
As a student and as a child, I don't want my morale to go down.

02:17:51.384 --> 02:17:53.246
How will I study in such an environment?

02:17:53.666 --> 02:17:55.508
And this could also happen to other kids.

02:17:55.989 --> 02:17:57.671
Hopefully you all understand how

02:17:58.231 --> 02:18:00.775
Bullying can affect the growing kids and their parents.

02:18:01.295 --> 02:18:07.183
My concern is when all truth facts about other civilizations are given, then why not Indian civilization?

02:18:07.443 --> 02:18:07.784
Thank you.

02:18:13.590 --> 02:18:17.011
Respected members of SBE, my name is Rajesh Yavantikar.

02:18:18.031 --> 02:18:24.653
I work here in high-tech company and I'm here, I'm a proud father of a daughter as well.

02:18:24.693 --> 02:18:27.114
She goes to the Folsom Cordova District School.

02:18:27.694 --> 02:18:31.135
I stand here to oppose the hatred against Hindus and Hinduism.

02:18:31.535 --> 02:18:34.756
I commend and fully support the decision of IQC to reject

02:18:35.356 --> 02:18:36.937
two programs of HMS.

02:18:37.237 --> 02:18:41.898
These programs are blatantly racist, hinduphobic, and worst in quality.

02:18:42.258 --> 02:18:53.282
They have numerous violations of category 1 of adoption guidelines, especially the category 1.10, which prohibits the adverse reflection based on religion and ethnicity.

02:18:53.602 --> 02:18:58.164
They also violate the California law, which prohibits the religious discrimination

02:18:58.624 --> 02:19:04.297
My ask is to reject racist publishers like McGraw Hill, HMH, and Discovery.

02:19:04.397 --> 02:19:06.342
Thank you for your time and patience listening.

02:19:10.550 --> 02:19:12.211
respected member of the SBE.

02:19:12.431 --> 02:19:13.871
My name is Abha Killedar.

02:19:14.171 --> 02:19:23.194
I stand here among hundreds of Hindus who are speaking today and thousands of others who have sent letters and signed petitions across California.

02:19:23.694 --> 02:19:32.197
Today I am speaking out against the harmful perception and racist content that McGraw Hill is attempting to put in the textbook for our youth.

02:19:33.098 --> 02:19:47.349
This publisher has the duty to compile with the framework set forth by the California Department of Education, and if McGraw-Hill chooses not to accept this correction, the book themselves must be rejected, as was HMHS content.

02:19:47.729 --> 02:19:59.398
Further, the recommendation put forth by the academic coalition led by Professor Jeffrey Long must be accepted if we wish to create a safe and fair learning environment for the students across California.

02:19:59.618 --> 02:20:00.479
Thank you for your time.

02:20:05.185 --> 02:20:05.785
Hello to all.

02:20:06.406 --> 02:20:07.586
My name is Balu Shastri.

02:20:08.326 --> 02:20:10.988
I'm an energy market specialist from Los Angeles.

02:20:11.748 --> 02:20:16.290
First off, I would like to also just lend support to the LGBT colleagues and their efforts.

02:20:17.370 --> 02:20:18.371
I went to school from L.A.

02:20:18.411 --> 02:20:19.031
from preschool.

02:20:19.091 --> 02:20:20.312
I was born and raised in L.A.

02:20:21.112 --> 02:20:25.294
and I would like to think Los Angeles is, you know, the epitome of diversity and inclusiveness.

02:20:26.081 --> 02:20:32.403
Yet, in school, I faced insulting comments about Hinduism, mocking the idea of seeing divinity in animals.

02:20:32.423 --> 02:20:34.864
A couple of kids even told me that I'm going to hell.

02:20:35.684 --> 02:20:39.445
I don't think this is the kind of circumstances that any kid should face.

02:20:40.406 --> 02:20:48.068
So I would urge to reject HMH as recommended by the IQC, and I would urge to support the edits by Jeffrey Long and 38 other academics.

02:20:48.809 --> 02:20:49.789
Thank you, and have a good day.

02:20:53.851 --> 02:20:55.932
Hi, my name is Sanjana Prabhakar.

02:20:56.012 --> 02:20:57.833
I'm from San Jose.

02:20:58.434 --> 02:21:13.282
And I'm here for the same reason as many of us, to reject HMH as recommended by IQC and support the edits by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other academics.

02:21:14.283 --> 02:21:14.683
I'm here.

02:21:16.444 --> 02:21:17.425
I came to U.S.

02:21:17.465 --> 02:21:22.668
when I was 19, and I had my three kids born and brought up here.

02:21:23.128 --> 02:21:30.872
So my first daughter, when she went to school, she was harassed and she was bullied, but she was able to handle it.

02:21:30.932 --> 02:21:34.955
We took her to India for many, you know, to show her the actual India.

02:21:36.025 --> 02:21:43.175
But my other daughter was not able to take the bully she was facing in school.

02:21:43.736 --> 02:21:45.318
And she went into depression.

02:21:45.378 --> 02:21:50.485
And I mean, as a mother, you can't even imagine what we have gone through.

02:21:51.065 --> 02:21:55.107
and she was severely depressed.

02:21:55.127 --> 02:21:58.389
She was in lockdown for five days, and she was on medication.

02:21:58.509 --> 02:22:15.219
I mean, I don't think any of you, you can see a mother's situation, and I don't want other kids to go through this, and I would request you to take the recommendations of Professor Jeffrey Long.

02:22:15.279 --> 02:22:15.599
Thank you.

02:22:21.700 --> 02:22:24.662
Hello.

02:22:25.482 --> 02:22:28.063
I'll come to the meaning of that at the end of my small talk.

02:22:29.604 --> 02:22:38.808
Respected members of State Board of Education, I'm from Folsom, California, and I have two children who have completed education in this system.

02:22:40.288 --> 02:22:43.930
I stand here to support IQC's decision to reject

02:22:45.999 --> 02:22:50.220
HMH K-6 and HMH 6-8 programs.

02:22:50.981 --> 02:22:59.403
I stand in support of the recommendations of academic coalition by Professor Jeffrey Long and the 38 other top academics.

02:23:00.023 --> 02:23:02.944
Please, please accept all their recommendations.

02:23:04.004 --> 02:23:09.786
Biased portrayal of Hinduism, which is lopsided and is inaccurate.

02:23:11.886 --> 02:23:22.677
sixth grade textbook of HMH 6 to 8 program calls Vedas the sacred Hindu scriptures as a collection of spells and charms.

02:23:23.838 --> 02:23:25.780
No other sacred book is like this.

02:23:26.280 --> 02:23:31.025
Hence, I ask you again to reject HMH programs.

02:23:31.325 --> 02:23:31.646
Thank you.

02:23:44.028 --> 02:23:46.990
Dear members of State Board of Education, Namaste.

02:23:47.870 --> 02:23:52.213
I am a 6th grader from Emperor Elementary School in Temple City, Los Angeles.

02:23:52.873 --> 02:23:56.615
I have read the chapter on Indian culture in my social studies textbook.

02:23:57.195 --> 02:24:01.638
I can certainly say that it is not an accurate representation of my religion.

02:24:02.398 --> 02:24:08.602
A bullying report on Hindu American children says that a student was bullied after they learned about Hinduism.

02:24:09.875 --> 02:24:14.779
Please drop any textbook drafts that do not promote civil behavior towards each other.

02:24:15.519 --> 02:24:21.164
It will be a great step to stop bullying in schools and promote harmony.

02:24:21.964 --> 02:24:27.048
I would also like to see topics covering yoga, Indian music, and dance in my textbooks.

02:24:27.729 --> 02:24:31.332
Many people in California practice these arts and benefit from them.

02:24:32.443 --> 02:24:36.714
In fact, yoga originated in India and has many health benefits.

02:24:37.155 --> 02:24:39.361
Let's make our textbooks better and stop bullying.

02:24:39.602 --> 02:24:39.923
Thank you.

02:24:52.253 --> 02:24:56.898
Dear members of State Board of Education, I'm Neelima from Dublin and a parent of two.

02:24:57.539 --> 02:25:06.089
I fully support IQCF's decision to reject HMH K-6 and HMH 6-8 programs, but that is not enough.

02:25:06.710 --> 02:25:10.771
I support the recommendation of Jeffrey Long and 38 other top academics.

02:25:11.211 --> 02:25:12.051
Please include them.

02:25:12.612 --> 02:25:22.934
On page 177 of 6th grade textbook of HMH 6 through 8, program calls Vedas the sacred Hindu scriptures a collection of spells and charms.

02:25:23.475 --> 02:25:24.435
Spells and charms?

02:25:26.118 --> 02:25:29.381
No other sacred book is mentioned in such denigrating terms.

02:25:29.962 --> 02:25:32.785
This is inaccurate, biased, and discriminating.

02:25:33.285 --> 02:25:36.549
I stand here to oppose hatred against Hindus and Indians.

02:25:37.129 --> 02:25:43.076
Please consider this and don't make any child experience painful and leaving bad memories to them.

02:25:43.536 --> 02:25:44.417
Thank you for your time.

02:25:49.766 --> 02:25:51.708
Namaste everyone, respected members of the board.

02:25:52.609 --> 02:25:59.056
My name is Vijay Gugnani and I'm a concerned father of two kids, one currently a high schooler and other one a second grader.

02:25:59.837 --> 02:26:05.063
My son, who is high schooler now, he went through a humiliating and horrible experience of

02:26:05.923 --> 02:26:22.828
uh, learning highly inaccurate and distorted presentation of Hinduism in sixth grade, um, uh, our, our California education board ethnic and cultural group section clearly states to instill sense of pride in his or her heritage, um, and that no religious group should be

02:26:23.448 --> 02:26:24.508
portrait as inferior.

02:26:24.728 --> 02:26:25.368
I don't see that.

02:26:25.408 --> 02:26:30.429
How is that possible when books are portraying India and Hinduism in a completely negative light?

02:26:31.490 --> 02:26:47.913
I strongly believe you guys will take a right decision today and drop misleading and completely stereotyped narrative suggested by HMH, McGraw-Hill, National Geographic, and we'll support edits submitted by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other academics.

02:26:48.874 --> 02:26:53.678
I sincerely hope that my second grader doesn't have the same negative experience.

02:26:53.778 --> 02:26:54.319
Thank you very much.

02:27:00.104 --> 02:27:00.365
Hi.

02:27:01.326 --> 02:27:01.506
Hi.

02:27:04.736 --> 02:27:09.118
Hi my name is Suchai and I'm a student at Cuesta Elementary School Mountain House.

02:27:09.679 --> 02:27:15.882
To me my country is a place where I get together with my aunts uncles and grandparents and have fun.

02:27:16.302 --> 02:27:18.263
To me my country is a beautiful place.

02:27:18.644 --> 02:27:22.406
To me my country is full of amazing and colorful cultures and traditions.

02:27:22.906 --> 02:27:25.547
But not everyone thinks of my country in this way.

02:27:26.208 --> 02:27:29.870
There was a class of 6th graders who were taught about Hinduism in this way.

02:27:30.470 --> 02:27:33.212
The teacher put a bunch of papers into a hat.

02:27:33.672 --> 02:27:37.614
Half of them said Brahmins and half of them said Untouchables.

02:27:38.174 --> 02:27:42.297
Each student picked up one piece of paper from the hat.

02:27:42.837 --> 02:27:51.002
If they were Brahmins for the rest of the week, they could talk only to other Brahmins, but they had to stay away from the Untouchables.

02:27:51.582 --> 02:27:54.464
If they are an Untouchable, they had to stay away from the Brahmins.

02:27:55.004 --> 02:27:56.665
That's not what Hinduism is.

02:27:57.285 --> 02:28:00.248
One of my friends of other religions learned about my culture.

02:28:00.268 --> 02:28:05.272
I don't want them to think about slums for people and the caste system.

02:28:05.772 --> 02:28:10.956
I want them to think of the beautiful festivals and temples that fill up my country.

02:28:11.176 --> 02:28:11.617
Thank you!

02:28:22.822 --> 02:28:29.204
Respected board members, I am Sunil Agarwal, concerned parent of 8th grader and 1st grader studying at LAUSD.

02:28:30.064 --> 02:28:37.087
I believe our education system should encourage and motivate children when they read and learn about their own culture, history, and religion.

02:28:37.947 --> 02:28:44.254
When I read sixth grade history book, I found untruthful and derogatory representation of India and Hinduism.

02:28:44.894 --> 02:28:52.803
I could not expose such untruthful and unequal right up to my daughter and decided to take her to India for sixth grade education.

02:28:53.804 --> 02:28:57.107
I brought her back once she completed her sixth grade in India.

02:28:57.888 --> 02:28:59.089
I have another first grader.

02:28:59.269 --> 02:29:05.755
I hope that by the time when she is in sixth grade, she will be reading all positive aspects about her heritage and religion.

02:29:06.395 --> 02:29:11.139
Hinduism gave number zero yoga, surgery, and so many wonderful things.

02:29:11.379 --> 02:29:17.184
According to Medicine Project, India was number one item in terms of GDP till 17th century in the world.

02:29:17.684 --> 02:29:24.750
Yoga is providing healthy lifestyle to millions of people around the world, but students are not exposed to such wonderful gifts of Hinduism in India.

02:29:25.230 --> 02:29:26.932
I urge board to please accept the changes.

02:29:26.992 --> 02:29:27.252
Thank you.

02:29:31.710 --> 02:29:38.034
Dear members of State Board of Education, I'm Radha, a concerned parent of two kids from Cupertino.

02:29:38.775 --> 02:29:43.498
I stand in front of you to speak against the demonization of Hindus and Indians.

02:29:44.259 --> 02:29:50.803
I stand here as a Hindu, as Indian, as an Asian, with the support of other Asians and Pacific Islanders.

02:29:51.403 --> 02:29:57.468
I stand here to support Jeffrey Long and other academics who are seeking historical accuracy.

02:29:58.348 --> 02:30:05.681
I commend IQC for rejecting the two Hinduphobic books that have the images that clearly depict

02:30:07.085 --> 02:30:10.508
Hinduism and India as filthy backward culture.

02:30:11.149 --> 02:30:14.732
However, I think this is not enough and much more needs to be done.

02:30:15.273 --> 02:30:20.478
I strongly urge the board to say no to hatred against Hindus in all forms.

02:30:21.159 --> 02:30:30.047
We, Hindus of all diverse backgrounds and of all castes, vocations, communities, languages, demand that hatred against Hindus be stopped.

02:30:30.388 --> 02:30:30.668
Thank you.

02:30:35.433 --> 02:30:37.614
Dear members of the State Board of Education.

02:30:38.015 --> 02:30:42.117
I'm Aditya Fadnavis studying in 6th grade in Lawson Middle School in Cupertino.

02:30:42.558 --> 02:30:47.681
I feel worried and insecure in my school environment after reading the bullying report released by HAF.

02:30:48.806 --> 02:30:55.630
I am utterly shocked that the textbooks which encourages these types of bullying are considered for adoption in California.

02:30:56.051 --> 02:31:04.236
I fully support IQC's decision to reject HMH K through 6 and HMH 6 through 8 programs but that is not enough.

02:31:04.776 --> 02:31:13.201
I request you to consider rejecting the other textbooks from McGraw Hills and National Geographic and help bring a secure environment in our schools.

02:31:13.602 --> 02:31:13.902
Thank you.

02:31:18.567 --> 02:31:19.448
Hi, good morning, everyone.

02:31:19.608 --> 02:31:20.469
I hope I'm audible.

02:31:21.110 --> 02:31:26.415
First of all, good morning to everyone, all the state members of education.

02:31:26.795 --> 02:31:35.804
My name is Prasanna, resident of San Jose, a parent of two children who are studying in San Jose school, and a proud husband.

02:31:36.424 --> 02:31:39.407
My wife is also a teacher in one of the private schools.

02:31:39.487 --> 02:31:42.791
And today, I'm representing all four of them.

02:31:43.291 --> 02:31:49.058
So first of all, I would like to congratulate IQC for their decision to reject two HMH programs.

02:31:49.698 --> 02:31:52.401
But I believe that itself is not enough.

02:31:52.922 --> 02:31:55.565
Today I stand here with two split sentiments.

02:31:55.865 --> 02:31:57.587
Part of me is in complete disbelief.

02:31:58.348 --> 02:32:05.050
that the textbooks which will bring racism to classroom are scheduled to get into our academics syllabus.

02:32:05.610 --> 02:32:15.593
And part of me is very hopeful that the State Board of Education will listen to the request made by thousands of parents like me and make a right decision.

02:32:16.113 --> 02:32:23.795
I strongly urge SB members to consider the recommendations made by Academic Coalition, by Professor Geoffrey Long and 38 other academics.

02:32:24.075 --> 02:32:24.695
Thank you for listening.

02:32:31.360 --> 02:32:32.060
Good morning, everyone.

02:32:32.481 --> 02:32:35.802
My name is Vinod, and I'm a parent of a third grader in San Jose.

02:32:36.643 --> 02:32:43.066
A few weeks back, the IQC rejected the HMH textbooks drafts for K-6 and 6th grade.

02:32:43.446 --> 02:32:44.886
I'm really delighted about that.

02:32:45.627 --> 02:32:52.550
The problem with the HMH textbook drafts is that it has only the demeaning information about Hinduism and India.

02:32:53.851 --> 02:32:55.671
In the first page of grade 6, module 6,

02:32:56.892 --> 02:33:06.057
has a picture of Lord Indra on an elephant with a beautiful gold crown with precious jewels, but the narrative refers to him as a unicorn.

02:33:06.777 --> 02:33:17.823
This kind of textbook is unacceptable to me as a parent because I, as a parent, would not encourage this kind of name-calling, but this is not what the textbook is promoting.

02:33:18.804 --> 02:33:26.133
These kind of drafts clearly violate California Education Code 51501, 60040, and 60044.

02:33:27.775 --> 02:33:34.143
I request the SBE to go ahead with the IQC recommendation of rejecting HMS draft.

02:33:34.304 --> 02:33:34.544
Thank you.

02:33:39.235 --> 02:33:42.757
Dear members of the State Board of Education, my name is Akshata.

02:33:43.158 --> 02:33:50.262
I'm a parent of four-year-old and here to express my deep anguish on how Hinduism and India have been represented in the textbooks.

02:33:50.963 --> 02:34:02.911
As I became aware of this issue, I have been worried thinking how my son would be impacted with such biased, stereotypical, and inaccurate textbooks creating prejudice against his culture and religion.

02:34:04.076 --> 02:34:12.540
I deeply appreciate and wholeheartedly support IQC's decision to reject the Hardcourt K-6 and K-6-8 books.

02:34:13.160 --> 02:34:19.302
I do believe that National Geographic also carries problematic Oriental content against Hindu civilization.

02:34:19.863 --> 02:34:29.607
Our history should be documented through we the inheritors of the civilization rather than the invaders who came to plunder, erase, divide, and enslave our identity.

02:34:30.087 --> 02:34:32.868
I humbly request SBE to reject Hardcourt.

02:34:33.877 --> 02:34:37.359
National Geographic has submitted a document to the CDE with corrections.

02:34:37.819 --> 02:34:42.722
National Geographic books should be adopted only if all these changes are reflected in their textbooks.

02:34:42.902 --> 02:34:43.182
Thank you.

02:34:53.174 --> 02:34:55.435
Respected members of State Board of Education.

02:34:55.815 --> 02:35:00.497
My name is Rishika Sahoo and I'm a fifth grader in Brewer Island Elementary School in Foster City.

02:35:00.957 --> 02:35:04.998
My older sister is in 9th grade and she learned misguided information about Hindu culture.

02:35:05.719 --> 02:35:08.400
I know the many truths about Hinduism but her classmates don't.

02:35:09.360 --> 02:35:14.322
I don't want to go through what my sister felt and read about my culture negatively in her school.

02:35:15.282 --> 02:35:20.624
I also don't want to be teased taunted and bullied by my classmates due to what the textbook will say next year.

02:35:21.445 --> 02:35:22.285
So I please don't.

02:35:23.317 --> 02:35:26.738
So please don't make my textbook next year misguided and hinduphobic.

02:35:27.278 --> 02:35:31.479
I think and support IQC's decision to reject Harcourt's two programs.

02:35:31.720 --> 02:35:32.600
Thank you for listening.

02:35:44.823 --> 02:35:47.764
Respected member of the State Board of Education.

02:35:47.984 --> 02:35:50.125
I'm Manoj Kumar Sahu father of two children.

02:35:51.064 --> 02:35:54.746
studying in ninth grade and fifth grade in San Mateo County.

02:35:55.707 --> 02:36:05.432
My first child has learned negative perception and presentation of the Hinduism from the middle school textbook that wireless California State Law Education Court

02:36:07.225 --> 02:36:12.408
After coming from home, she told us that she was disappointed in the Hinduism section of the textbook.

02:36:13.549 --> 02:36:17.511
I don't want my second child to learn the same misconception about Hinduism.

02:36:18.131 --> 02:36:27.777
So I'm here to support IQC's decision to reject HMH K-6th grade and HMH 6th to 8th grade programs.

02:36:28.217 --> 02:36:32.079
And I request you, please reject McGraw-Hill programs.

02:36:33.921 --> 02:36:37.694
learn that they have not adopted 2016 testbook framework.

02:36:38.136 --> 02:36:38.858
Thank you for listening.

02:36:44.520 --> 02:36:45.241
Good morning, everyone.

02:36:45.441 --> 02:36:47.963
I'm Manish Jain, and I follow Jainism.

02:36:48.864 --> 02:36:55.609
I'm standing here to oppose bullying originating from racial discrimination in social science textbooks from 6th to 8th grade.

02:36:56.090 --> 02:37:08.841
In my opinion, the content of books published by McGraw-Hill Publishers discriminate against Hinduism in India, which indirectly motivates racial discrimination against American students following Hinduism.

02:37:09.341 --> 02:37:12.324
California Governor Jerry Brown passed a bill on anti-bullying.

02:37:12.464 --> 02:37:20.231
However, the social science books published by McGraw-Hills directly or indirectly motivates bullying.

02:37:20.791 --> 02:37:26.657
I request you to seriously reconsider McGraw-Hills' recommendations.

02:37:27.237 --> 02:37:32.942
Politics and hatred should not guide our textbooks, but research and facts should.

02:37:33.082 --> 02:37:33.663
Thank you for your time.

02:37:40.272 --> 02:37:42.634
respected members of the State Board of Education.

02:37:43.014 --> 02:37:49.119
I am from Rancho Cordova, Sacramento, father of two kids, studying in sixth standard and kindergarten.

02:37:49.639 --> 02:37:56.104
I stand here not only to fight hatred against the Hindu Americans, but also support the African American communities.

02:37:56.865 --> 02:38:01.188
All communities, all parents, all educators have the concern of children in mind.

02:38:02.248 --> 02:38:07.452
That's why we need to stop hatred against all communities and need to respect for all communities.

02:38:08.613 --> 02:38:14.918
I stand here to support Jeffrey Long and 38 other academics who are seeking historical accuracy.

02:38:15.438 --> 02:38:21.823
I request that the recommendation by the Jeffrey Long and the academic group be accepted to address all the problems.

02:38:22.003 --> 02:38:22.744
Thank you for hearing.

02:38:24.105 --> 02:38:24.805
Thank you for listening.

02:38:24.966 --> 02:38:25.186
Thank you.

02:38:30.922 --> 02:38:36.989
Respected members of the California State Board of Education, my name is Vishnu Mata and I'm an 8th grader living in Mountain House, California.

02:38:37.470 --> 02:38:43.296
I would like to talk about the problem of bullying of Hindu American students as a result of information in the 6th grade education system.

02:38:43.897 --> 02:38:48.042
I suffered first-hand experience from this terrible outbreak of bullying of Hindu American students.

02:38:48.582 --> 02:38:51.663
I do not want other students to feel the pain and shame that I did.

02:38:52.163 --> 02:38:59.745
If textbooks indirectly encourage kids to call Hindus untouchables, or tell them that all Indians grew up in slums, it is an injustice to the rest of the population.

02:39:00.265 --> 02:39:02.866
It is an injustice to know that many Hindus will be bullied like me.

02:39:03.406 --> 02:39:07.507
And it is certainly an injustice if other kids must feel all the wretched feelings that I had to feel.

02:39:07.887 --> 02:39:08.828
and this must change now.

02:39:09.608 --> 02:39:13.171
I advocate for all changes that my fellow speakers have made, and much more.

02:39:13.872 --> 02:39:17.995
If we can change the outlook of even one student, then we have definitely succeeded.

02:39:18.556 --> 02:39:19.757
Thank you, esteemed board members.

02:39:24.500 --> 02:39:31.726
Hi, my name is Chen Mai and I'm a sophomore at Mount House High School and I stand here to oppose hatred against Hindus and Indians.

02:39:32.226 --> 02:39:36.189
Currently, I'm taking a college class on Eastern religions, including Hinduism.

02:39:36.729 --> 02:39:43.795
During our lecture on Hinduism, my professor said, and I quote, Hindus believe that everyone else in the world is Hindu.

02:39:44.295 --> 02:39:47.637
It's a way of living that everyone in India is made to follow.

02:39:48.218 --> 02:39:53.942
I was baffled by this statement, so I raised my hand and told him, I'm a Hindu and I accept other religions.

02:39:54.522 --> 02:39:59.085
This is to which he replied, saying, maybe you're not a Hindu.

02:39:59.725 --> 02:40:04.409
This exchange occurred in a college class with over 50 other students.

02:40:05.289 --> 02:40:13.915
The Hindus in our class tried to tell him that this isn't what we believe, but these misconceptions were so deeply rooted that there was nothing we could do about it.

02:40:14.756 --> 02:40:20.161
The beliefs that people have in adulthood reflects what they were taught from a young age.

02:40:20.742 --> 02:40:28.890
If we can fix this false perspective that people are holding from their childhood, we can stop people from having experiences like this.

02:40:29.410 --> 02:40:35.156
America is a country that has the blending of different races, and we're here to create awareness and acceptance.

02:40:45.603 --> 02:40:47.324
respected member of SBE.

02:40:48.444 --> 02:40:52.866
My name is Ekanath Pai, and I live in San Ramon with my wife and two kids.

02:40:54.206 --> 02:40:56.047
They also attended SRVUSD.

02:40:57.048 --> 02:41:04.931
So 11th grader in Texas was told by her classmates to convert to Christianity, to become more civilized.

02:41:06.071 --> 02:41:11.838
A seventh grader in New York was bullied by the classmate saying her Hinduism was devil's religion.

02:41:12.439 --> 02:41:18.446
Such unfortunate events are a result of textbooks presenting Hindus as primitive, dirty, and bad.

02:41:19.287 --> 02:41:25.434
There is no such place for hatred and bullying in a civilized place like ours.

02:41:26.414 --> 02:41:30.515
So the solution is to present Hinduism in a dignified and respectful manner.

02:41:31.095 --> 02:41:35.357
I support recommendation of Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other scholars.

02:41:36.977 --> 02:41:47.921
I also urge you to take your responsibility seriously, please, and to reject all content that promotes hatred and bullying, just the way IQC has done recently.

02:41:48.561 --> 02:41:48.941
Thank you.

02:42:02.486 --> 02:42:05.067
Dear members of the SPE.

02:42:05.508 --> 02:42:10.550
I'm Mukta Shinde a fourth grader from Cupertino Union School District.

02:42:10.950 --> 02:42:14.532
Textbooks should tell the correct history about Hindus.

02:42:14.933 --> 02:42:22.517
If they don't then students from all communities will think the history it's correct and pass on the wrong information.

02:42:22.797 --> 02:42:28.440
So I urge you to stop this from happening because only you can do it at this point.

02:42:28.840 --> 02:42:31.001
Thank you for your patience and listening.

02:42:42.947 --> 02:42:43.932
This is good for you.

02:42:47.608 --> 02:42:48.048
Good morning.

02:42:48.789 --> 02:42:49.930
My name is Shadipta Sen.

02:42:50.290 --> 02:42:52.131
I'm a professor of history at UC Davis.

02:42:53.172 --> 02:42:57.656
I have taught history of India and South Asia in this country for nearly 25 years.

02:42:58.436 --> 02:43:14.068
I'm here representing the 100 leading scholars from South Asia from top-ranked American universities who are signatories to this letter that we have distributed, asking you to desist from voting on adopting these textbooks till you fix these mistakes that we have underlined.

02:43:15.189 --> 02:43:25.938
I implore you to convene a new review board of experts from institutions such as Davis, Berkeley, and others in the UC system to look into this matter.

02:43:27.139 --> 02:43:34.265
Publishers have been put under tremendous and unfair pressure to erase facts about the historical inequities, inequalities of caste and gender.

02:43:34.845 --> 02:43:44.295
by lobbyists who also want to marginalize the contribution of Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, Muslims, and Dalits to South Asian history and civilization.

02:43:44.836 --> 02:43:52.644
Such sanitized and biased textbooks will not help our young students prepare for high school and college-level history courses.

02:43:53.365 --> 02:43:58.312
My research and teaching are funded by you, California taxpayers.

02:43:58.372 --> 02:44:06.264
It is my responsibility to make sure that K-8 teachers are not forced to misrepresent Indian and South Asian history to our children.

02:44:06.685 --> 02:44:06.925
Thank you.

02:44:10.569 --> 02:44:11.670
I'm Anasuya Sengupta.

02:44:12.070 --> 02:44:13.612
I'm with South Asian Histories for All.

02:44:13.952 --> 02:44:17.515
We represent eight religions, multiple castes, and over 20 groups.

02:44:17.996 --> 02:44:28.445
I speak after one renowned historian, Professor Sen, and over 100 Hindu nationalists, because this is what education has come to, history by brute force and alternative facts.

02:44:29.105 --> 02:44:29.865
I'm a Rhodes Scholar.

02:44:30.145 --> 02:44:30.705
I'm a Hindu.

02:44:31.005 --> 02:44:35.426
The Hindu American Foundation does not speak for me and our diverse South Asian communities.

02:44:35.946 --> 02:44:44.788
They've lobbied to erase caste oppression, the histories of Buddhism and Sikhism, demonized Muslims, and reduced my practice of Hindu pluralism to Hindu supremacy.

02:44:45.308 --> 02:44:48.868
The curriculum framework that you adopted was for parity and fairness.

02:44:49.328 --> 02:44:52.309
California students deserve better than propaganda and lies.

02:44:52.869 --> 02:44:54.269
SBA, please act now.

02:44:54.769 --> 02:44:56.230
Enforce your framework.

02:44:56.670 --> 02:44:57.490
Fix the mistakes.

02:44:58.070 --> 02:44:58.330
Thank you.

02:45:06.960 --> 02:45:09.261
Hello, I'm Rakesh Patak from San Jose.

02:45:11.362 --> 02:45:18.104
This is a picture of an Indian empire, a section in the HMH K-6 textbook.

02:45:18.264 --> 02:45:18.984
Is this an empire?

02:45:20.645 --> 02:45:22.365
This is a blatant caricature of Indians.

02:45:22.585 --> 02:45:24.646
It shows monkeys working with humans.

02:45:25.866 --> 02:45:28.947
This is a violation of California state law education code section 51501.

02:45:29.067 --> 02:45:31.768
Google can do better.

02:45:33.329 --> 02:45:35.970
I'm relieved that IQC has rejected both the drafts from HMH.

02:45:37.665 --> 02:45:38.085
Is it enough?

02:45:38.526 --> 02:45:38.666
No.

02:45:39.547 --> 02:45:42.189
We need to do the same for National Geographic.

02:45:42.610 --> 02:45:42.810
Why?

02:45:42.830 --> 02:45:52.259
It has outdated and completely disregarded HSS framework of the latest 2016.

02:45:53.020 --> 02:46:00.467
It completely ignores the scriptures and the basic concept of Hinduism, Vedas, yoga, primary goals in life.

02:46:01.568 --> 02:46:02.149
I request you to

02:46:02.768 --> 02:46:08.532
Follow the recommendations of Professor Long and the other academics who have submitted what should be corrected in these books.

02:46:08.752 --> 02:46:09.032
Thank you.

02:46:14.817 --> 02:46:19.200
Dear board members, my name is Umesh Pathak and I'm from San Jose.

02:46:19.600 --> 02:46:23.283
From India, I'm from Gaya, where Buddha got enlightenment.

02:46:24.023 --> 02:46:25.004
That's where I come from.

02:46:25.916 --> 02:46:34.224
To come to the point, IQC recommended rejecting one of the racist publishers, HMH Harcourt, K6 and 628.

02:46:34.884 --> 02:46:43.332
However, IQC missed rejecting McGraw-Hill and National Geographic published textbooks, leaving me still distressed.

02:46:44.273 --> 02:46:59.921
I request all of you to not only reject HMH, but also National Geographic and McGraw-Hill for K6, 6 to 8, since these two publishers do not care to follow the framework that you have agreed upon.

02:47:00.481 --> 02:47:08.085
For example, both publishers ignore oneness of all living beings, and National Geographic ignores Jainism entirely in Chapter 10.

02:47:09.238 --> 02:47:25.890
I expect you to make sure that you and publishers follow the frameworks and law of the land before allowing any book in the schools to eliminate religion and ethnicity-based bullying of students, such as my sons, in the schools and society.

02:47:26.230 --> 02:47:28.572
And yes, I don't also like propaganda.

02:47:34.656 --> 02:47:39.659
Hello all, I am Vishwanath Jakka from San Jose, a father of a 9th grader and a 5th grader.

02:47:40.840 --> 02:47:47.143
I would like to first start off with saying thanks to IQC for correctly rejecting the two Hinduphobic books.

02:47:47.484 --> 02:47:57.650
However, I would like to ask SBE to reject those two as well and not only there, reject other books that are propagating this Hinduphobic content.

02:47:58.670 --> 02:48:01.333
So it's not just the other publishers.

02:48:01.353 --> 02:48:09.300
There are other groups who are, in the last minute, bringing in new, unvalidated, incorrect information to solve the process.

02:48:10.985 --> 02:48:16.332
I stand in front of you to speak against the demonization of Hindus and our culture.

02:48:17.013 --> 02:48:29.848
I also stand here with the support of LGBTQ community, Asians, numerous interfaith groups, and representation by academics, educationalists, and those of Hindus.

02:48:30.569 --> 02:48:37.295
We have a diverse background with all communities, castes, religions, and regions and languages.

02:48:37.876 --> 02:48:44.021
I urge SBE to stop the propagation of hatred against Hindus and Hinduism.

02:48:44.182 --> 02:48:44.482
Thank you.

02:48:50.652 --> 02:48:53.554
Respected members of the State Board of Education, good morning.

02:48:54.094 --> 02:48:57.976
I am Ashta Lakshmi, a Tamil, a practicing Hindu from the Bay Area.

02:48:58.517 --> 02:49:08.182
A fringe Hinduphobic group, South Asian Histories for All, SAFA, is suggesting edits that are not just hateful, but are inaccurate and violative of HSS adoption criteria.

02:49:08.542 --> 02:49:17.468
The changes that they suggest will not only lead to Category 1 violation, especially Category 1.10, but also violation of norms of the social content.

02:49:18.288 --> 02:49:26.395
What this fringe group, SAFA, is trying, through its edits, is to present a Hinduphobic view of caste and thereby spread hatred.

02:49:26.735 --> 02:49:36.264
They are systematically trying to erase the history of Dalits, lower caste Hindus, their spiritual movements, and even instances of emancipation that come from within the Hindu society.

02:49:36.704 --> 02:49:41.188
They try to attribute all of the emancipation of Hindus to Buddhists, Sikhs, and Muslims.

02:49:41.628 --> 02:49:49.052
They have not even mentioned a single instance of positive contributions of lower caste Hindus in their edits, wherein history is full of such examples.

02:49:49.733 --> 02:49:55.836
Looking at the magnitude and adverse effect of the edits suggested by them, I earnestly appeal you to reject these edits.

02:49:55.977 --> 02:49:56.337
Thank you.

02:49:59.539 --> 02:50:00.079
Good morning.

02:50:00.159 --> 02:50:02.080
First of all, I really applaud you.

02:50:02.120 --> 02:50:03.101
You're very good listeners.

02:50:04.216 --> 02:50:05.696
My name is Ravinder Kumar.

02:50:05.876 --> 02:50:11.957
I'm a proud father of daughter and son, who already graduate to be a doctor and software engineers.

02:50:13.538 --> 02:50:23.160
And both of my kids felt bullied because of the history lesson that perpetuate the stereotype about the homeland.

02:50:24.560 --> 02:50:30.921
I don't know, gentlemen, ladies, how you feel when your kid come home bullied, but I felt pretty bad about that.

02:50:32.927 --> 02:50:52.992
In my earnest effort to save my next generation from being bullied and misrepresentation of Hindu religion and Hindu culture, I fully support the recommendation of the Instructional Quality Commission to reject the textbooks of HMH, but

02:50:53.937 --> 02:50:58.078
but I would like you to do more to fix the problems.

02:50:58.859 --> 02:51:02.260
McGraw-Hill has a lot of prejudiced and racist content.

02:51:03.060 --> 02:51:09.722
I also demand that all the recommendations of Academic Coalition of Professor Jeffrey and Long, 38 other top academics, be accepted.

02:51:09.903 --> 02:51:10.543
Thank you very much.

02:51:10.563 --> 02:51:11.023
Have a good day.

02:51:13.924 --> 02:51:15.444
Hello, respected board members.

02:51:15.885 --> 02:51:19.646
My name is Ramani Cheru from San Jose, and I'm a proud practicing Hindu.

02:51:20.990 --> 02:51:24.988
I am here to talk about the misrepresentation of one of the oldest religions in the planet.

02:51:25.646 --> 02:51:28.569
There is a quote that a picture speaks 1,000 words.

02:51:29.349 --> 02:51:35.555
The pictures displayed in the textbooks from publishers like HMH represent Hinduism in a very disgraceful manner.

02:51:36.275 --> 02:51:39.658
I would request you to reject such publishers and replace the content.

02:51:40.159 --> 02:51:50.948
May I suggest replacing the images with positive aspects like yoga and meditation, cultural diversity, scriptures, and spirituality that Hinduism can offer?

02:51:51.369 --> 02:51:51.689
Thank you.

02:51:55.151 --> 02:51:59.213
Hello, I'm Jyoti Agrawal, a resident of San Jose, father of two children.

02:51:59.233 --> 02:52:05.416
I stand here to support IQC's decision to reject HMH book for K25 and 628.

02:52:06.216 --> 02:52:11.538
Further, I support the recommendations made by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other academics.

02:52:12.158 --> 02:52:15.120
I appeal the chair to accept all their recommendations.

02:52:15.760 --> 02:52:26.293
The HMH program deserved to be dejected because on page 177 of 6th grade textbook, it calls the Vedas, the sacred Hindu scripture, a collection of spells and charms.

02:52:26.754 --> 02:52:27.615
I am outraged.

02:52:28.235 --> 02:52:31.439
No other sacred book is mentioned in such denigrating terms.

02:52:31.920 --> 02:52:35.224
This is inaccurate, biased, underwhelming and discriminatory.

02:52:35.859 --> 02:52:41.482
IQC has shown the courage to reject hatred and prejudice by rejecting two Hindu phobic books.

02:52:41.962 --> 02:52:48.365
We request SBE also to reject all hateful content and say no to hatred against Hindus in all aspects.

02:52:48.705 --> 02:52:50.506
Thank you and please do the needful.

02:52:54.113 --> 02:52:56.694
Namaste, members of the State Board of Education.

02:52:57.235 --> 02:52:58.375
My name is Shilpa Jakka.

02:52:58.855 --> 02:53:01.557
I'm a parent of a 9th grader and a 5th grader in San Jose.

02:53:02.257 --> 02:53:06.999
I stand here to support IQC's decision to reject HMH books from K-8 period.

02:53:07.760 --> 02:53:10.641
Some of the pictures are racist and discriminate against Hindus.

02:53:11.382 --> 02:53:13.603
How could somebody propose such books for schools?

02:53:14.463 --> 02:53:23.706
They have numerous violations of Category 1 of adoption guidelines, especially Category 1.10, which prohibits adverse reflection based on religion and ethnicity.

02:53:24.507 --> 02:53:28.428
They also violate the California law, which prohibits religious discrimination.

02:53:29.408 --> 02:53:34.890
Further, I support the recommendations made by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other academics.

02:53:35.610 --> 02:53:39.692
I appeal the chair of State Board of Education to accept all the recommendations.

02:53:40.052 --> 02:53:40.332
Thank you.

02:53:45.714 --> 02:53:48.949
Hello, Namaste, respected members of State Board of Education.

02:53:50.300 --> 02:53:53.141
I am Divya, and I'm a parent for a four-year-old.

02:53:53.161 --> 02:54:03.064
I reside in Folsom, and I stand here today to oppose the hatred that our textbooks are displaying against Hindus and Indians.

02:54:04.424 --> 02:54:10.225
I thank and fully support the decision of IQC to reject the two programs of HMH.

02:54:11.006 --> 02:54:18.948
I understand that even after a number of revisions and rewrites submitted by the publisher at the last minute,

02:54:19.768 --> 02:54:26.373
even that does not show all the right aspects of Indian culture and history.

02:54:26.974 --> 02:54:30.616
There are a lot of errors, even the small errors.

02:54:30.936 --> 02:54:38.422
For example, the K-6 teacher edition of page number 469, their revision says Martin Luther King Jr.

02:54:38.482 --> 02:54:40.343
instead of the Martin Luther King.

02:54:41.264 --> 02:54:52.027
So what we are standing here and asking is to depict the great Indian civilization with dignity and the truthfulness.

02:54:55.108 --> 02:55:05.572
Hence, I conclude by saying that please accept the rejection of IQC, HMH, and two programs, and recommend the IQC.

02:55:05.672 --> 02:55:06.012
Thank you.

02:55:12.970 --> 02:55:15.090
Respected members of SBE, namaste.

02:55:15.390 --> 02:55:20.091
My name is Vaishnavi Ravinuthala, and this is my third time speaking here for the following cause.

02:55:20.811 --> 02:55:24.452
I, as a sophomore in high school, can vouch for all the Hindu children who get bullied.

02:55:25.232 --> 02:55:27.473
One of three Hindu American children get bullied.

02:55:27.753 --> 02:55:28.653
Why does this happen?

02:55:28.953 --> 02:55:33.394
This happens because of the wrong impressions of Hinduism in India made on students and teachers.

02:55:33.814 --> 02:55:41.395
In my school, because of pictures of slums and poverty in India, my teachers and classmates think that India is completely covered in slums.

02:55:41.855 --> 02:55:44.616
How does today's poverty even relate to ancient history?

02:55:44.936 --> 02:55:53.598
In fact, according to the study by OECD, The World Economy, by Angus Madison, India's GDP was 25% or above until the 1800s.

02:55:54.038 --> 02:55:59.740
It's been almost two decades since this work was published, but none of the books refer to such authentic information.

02:56:00.060 --> 02:56:03.541
This is pure arrogance because this esteemed CDE is giving a free ride.

02:56:03.801 --> 02:56:04.601
They should stop now.

02:56:05.021 --> 02:56:08.342
Please reject all textbooks that portray ancient India in a negative way.

02:56:08.602 --> 02:56:08.882
Thank you.

02:56:15.879 --> 02:56:23.367
Dear members of the State Board of Education, my name is Aditi Gajar and I'm a 10th grader attending Evergreen Valley High School in San Jose, California.

02:56:24.028 --> 02:56:31.756
Living in such a diverse place, I find it bothering that my culture and my religion are displayed so negatively in the 6th grade world history textbooks.

02:56:33.106 --> 02:56:40.431
In sixth grade, when our class finally got to the India chapter, I noticed that many key aspects were either missing or misrepresented.

02:56:41.071 --> 02:56:45.214
The textbook syllabus and use of words caused me to question my own culture.

02:56:46.014 --> 02:56:49.997
However, California state law education code sections clearly state

02:56:50.337 --> 02:57:05.685
that a governing board shall not adopt instructional materials for use in the schools that in its determination contain any matter reflecting adversely upon persons on the basis of race or ethnicity, gender, religion, or nationality.

02:57:06.485 --> 02:57:14.109
Thus, I ask you, why are Hindu children having to feel alienated in their own classroom because of content in their own world history textbooks?

02:57:21.465 --> 02:57:23.466
Good morning CDE community.

02:57:23.546 --> 02:57:26.686
My name is Shiva and I attend Chaboya Middle School.

02:57:26.966 --> 02:57:33.288
I want to raise a question of about why should India be represented as a poor and needy country.

02:57:34.088 --> 02:57:35.028
Would you show the U.S.

02:57:35.068 --> 02:57:36.629
with all the ugly faces in the country.

02:57:36.989 --> 02:57:37.689
Of course not.

02:57:38.169 --> 02:57:44.851
One day my mother wanted to take a campaign at my school middle school to get signatures for the last hearing here on

02:57:46.340 --> 02:57:47.301
28th of September.

02:57:47.781 --> 02:57:49.221
We asked the school for permission.

02:57:49.522 --> 02:57:55.984
When the assistant principal answered, she said, oh, your sons can start a club here to raise money for the poor and needy of India.

02:57:57.245 --> 02:57:59.805
This response taunted our family for days.

02:58:00.286 --> 02:58:02.286
Where did the assistant principal get this from?

02:58:02.687 --> 02:58:04.947
She saw books with pictures of ancient India.

02:58:05.388 --> 02:58:09.169
In fact, until 1800s, India's GDP was 25% or more of the world's GDP.

02:58:12.299 --> 02:58:21.765
Bias information is the law that there should be no bias information on religions in textbooks which the students and teachers take as credible is not acceptable.

02:58:22.106 --> 02:58:24.707
Please reject books that are biased against India.

02:58:25.128 --> 02:58:25.428
Thank you.

02:58:30.586 --> 02:58:36.210
Dear members of the State Board of Education, I'm Divya Shenoy, a 10th grade student at Evergreen Valley High School.

02:58:36.831 --> 02:58:44.477
In the 6th grade, I was excited to learn about my culture, only to be bent by ignorance and disgust from my classmates after reading the textbooks.

02:58:45.117 --> 02:58:48.980
My classmates confused deities for demons and mocked cultural dances.

02:58:49.861 --> 02:58:53.782
In response to this behavior, I felt ostracized and ashamed of my religion.

02:58:54.363 --> 02:59:02.805
Hindu students surveyed across the United States also feel the same, experiencing awkwardness and exclusion, and they deal with depression due to this bullying.

02:59:03.686 --> 02:59:09.147
I commend IQC for removing both HMH programs for middle school and elementary school children.

02:59:09.588 --> 02:59:16.010
Additionally, Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other scholars' recommendations should be taken into account when bettering the textbooks.

02:59:16.130 --> 02:59:16.450
Thank you.

02:59:20.732 --> 02:59:24.757
Hello everyone, my name is Shivangi Singh and I'm a junior at Evergreen Valley High School.

02:59:25.197 --> 02:59:35.670
I came to speak on this subject about two years ago and I'm kind of disappointed that nothing's happened yet because I'm a firm believer in the idea that education should be unbiased and that

02:59:36.391 --> 02:59:41.355
You should have both the good and the bad portrayed throughout the textbooks for the education to truly be unbiased.

02:59:41.615 --> 02:59:49.141
But I'd also like to remind you that every single religion has skeletons in their closet, but not every single religion is being portrayed the same.

02:59:49.602 --> 02:59:57.308
So I just want to bring up the case that you've been giving everybody else a fair chance, but we haven't received a fair chance.

02:59:57.889 --> 02:59:59.190
And I think that

02:59:59.790 --> 03:00:07.073
you should really accept the recommendations of Professor Jeffrey Long and all of the other academics in the coalition.

03:00:07.533 --> 03:00:10.615
And students deserve to receive an unbiased education.

03:00:10.695 --> 03:00:24.901
And by continuing to uphold this clear show of distaste towards my religion, you're not just hurting my people, you're hurting all of these other students who are going to be receiving a very small-minded and negative view of a religion that is very important to all of us.

03:00:24.941 --> 03:00:28.383
And that is not something that I think can be justified by a school board of education.

03:00:28.703 --> 03:00:29.003
Thank you.

03:00:34.150 --> 03:00:37.191
Respected members of the State Board of Education, Namaste.

03:00:37.611 --> 03:00:42.972
My name is Madhuri and I am a parent of two children from San Jose City, Evergreen School District.

03:00:43.833 --> 03:00:53.015
The edits which fringe Hindu-phobic groups such as South Asia Histories for All is asking for contents that are disturbing and contain hate material.

03:00:53.735 --> 03:00:56.276
I urge not to add these to the textbooks.

03:00:56.816 --> 03:01:07.299
Their changes clearly lead to major revisions to the textbooks at this last minute and such big changes at the last moment are not in accordance with the adoption guidelines.

03:01:07.819 --> 03:01:13.500
An example of such an edit is Hindu History of Harappa which is on page 214, line 829

03:01:16.681 --> 03:01:20.724
to 831 in 2016 HSS framework.

03:01:21.184 --> 03:01:29.869
Saraswati river which is on line of the page 215 line 814 of the framework is being asked to be removed.

03:01:30.449 --> 03:01:32.651
This would lead to violation of guidelines

03:01:34.152 --> 03:01:41.201
1.2 of HSS adoption in one of the changes that they say Harappan civilization is not mentioned.

03:01:42.242 --> 03:01:48.150
I sincerely request you to uphold the adoption guidelines and reject the hateful and inaccurate edits.

03:01:52.423 --> 03:01:56.686
Respected members of the State Board of Education, my name is Skanda Vasishta.

03:01:56.846 --> 03:01:59.448
I am in eighth grade and I attend Winston Churchill Middle School.

03:01:59.808 --> 03:02:05.472
When I was in sixth grade, prior to the Hinduism unit, I was excited to expand my knowledge about my religion.

03:02:05.572 --> 03:02:09.955
However, after reading the chapter, I was shocked to see the negative portrayal of Hinduism.

03:02:10.355 --> 03:02:12.016
This affected me personally.

03:02:12.256 --> 03:02:15.759
My peers would ask me questions about Hinduism that made me feel awkward.

03:02:16.159 --> 03:02:21.963
On a test, I wondered whether I should put the answer that matched up with my beliefs or the answer that came from the textbook.

03:02:22.923 --> 03:02:33.248
I have nothing against other religions, but as the year went on, I observed that other religions in the textbook were idealized, while Hinduism was described as a negative, unclean religion.

03:02:33.528 --> 03:02:38.790
Please take some action and reject the HMH history textbooks that show Hinduism in a negative way.

03:02:38.911 --> 03:02:39.731
Thank you for your time.

03:02:45.373 --> 03:02:45.773
Good morning.

03:02:46.274 --> 03:02:52.417
Respected members of State Board of Education, I am Gururaj Narasimha, living here in the USA since 2005.

03:02:52.898 --> 03:03:01.443
I strongly urge the board to reject history textbook from HMH publications and implement recommendations by the academic coalition led by Professor Jeffrey Long.

03:03:01.783 --> 03:03:07.486
I am proud of this country that provides opportunities to culturally diverse people from all around the world.

03:03:07.867 --> 03:03:14.671
I'm also proud of India, where I come from, and proud of my Hindu religion, which has taught me to be tolerant, peaceful, and nonviolent.

03:03:15.211 --> 03:03:22.495
My son studies in a local middle school here and like millions of kids of his age has been taught about the religions of the ancient world in his history textbook.

03:03:22.935 --> 03:03:26.417
It was shocking that Hinduism was portrayed in such a negative way in his textbook.

03:03:26.797 --> 03:03:29.018
I don't want my children to feel low about their rules.

03:03:29.458 --> 03:03:32.039
I don't want them to be bullied in the school because of their religion.

03:03:32.420 --> 03:03:36.802
I see only positive things being said of other religions, then why this indifference towards Hinduism?

03:03:37.362 --> 03:03:43.155
Textbooks should show Hinduism's huge contributions to the world in the fields of science, art, architecture and well-being instead.

03:03:43.616 --> 03:03:47.544
Again, I strongly urge the board to reject history textbooks from HMH publications.

03:03:47.844 --> 03:03:48.446
Thank you very much.

03:03:52.344 --> 03:03:55.405
Namaste, respected board members.

03:03:55.785 --> 03:03:57.466
My name is Ranga Thattiparthi.

03:03:57.966 --> 03:04:04.148
I'm a father of two girls who go to the Folsom-Kodawa school district.

03:04:04.668 --> 03:04:14.011
I would like to point out here inherent bias in the textbooks published by HMS against Hinduism.

03:04:15.591 --> 03:04:26.021
In particular, I would request you to remove the outdated and inaccurate narration about Indians and Hinduism.

03:04:27.702 --> 03:04:29.644
Indians and Hinduism.

03:04:30.905 --> 03:04:41.615
I fear my children will be a subject to the racial bias by fellow kids due to their faith they followed by birth.

03:04:42.213 --> 03:04:48.955
Hinduism has given to a lot in the field of mathematics, philosophy, yoga.

03:04:49.475 --> 03:04:59.279
And instead of that, instead of that, the book says, demonize Hinduism by showing the visuals in the textbook in bad light.

03:05:00.399 --> 03:05:03.000
Thank you for listening to me.

03:05:06.857 --> 03:05:07.197
Namaste.

03:05:08.158 --> 03:05:13.161
Our Veda has been telling we are living in a heliocentric era, which is not accepted in several religious books yet.

03:05:14.202 --> 03:05:18.525
Like this, Veda has lots of knowledge in every modern science.

03:05:19.325 --> 03:05:25.289
By 15th century, Christopher Columbus or Vasco da Gama were searching for India, not any other area.

03:05:26.311 --> 03:05:28.772
Eventually, India got inverted in 17th century.

03:05:29.752 --> 03:05:34.174
Invaders has practiced the evil practice such as divide and discriminate policy.

03:05:34.934 --> 03:05:36.395
They created the caste system.

03:05:36.655 --> 03:05:38.195
India never created a caste system.

03:05:40.076 --> 03:05:41.636
They created a caste system such as Dalit.

03:05:42.357 --> 03:05:45.198
We worship sage called Ved Vyas, Valmiki.

03:05:45.598 --> 03:05:47.799
The vested interests call them as Dalit.

03:05:47.979 --> 03:05:49.079
We don't call them as Dalit.

03:05:49.199 --> 03:05:49.859
We worship them.

03:05:52.140 --> 03:05:54.061
Hinduism, or Sanatana Dharma,

03:05:54.963 --> 03:05:59.704
can proudly say that holy books never teach us anything against any God's creation.

03:06:00.744 --> 03:06:03.265
We call all God's creation as Vasudeva Kudumbakam.

03:06:04.125 --> 03:06:10.027
Education system has to emphasize to the student that practicing divide and discrimination is bad.

03:06:10.787 --> 03:06:11.727
Students should be taught.

03:06:13.287 --> 03:06:13.587
Thank you.

03:06:20.369 --> 03:06:24.350
State board members, my name is Ted Levine and I'm president and CEO of Kids Discover.

03:06:25.040 --> 03:06:30.425
We are a family owned and operated company and we've been producing elementary curriculum materials for over 26 years.

03:06:31.046 --> 03:06:40.115
Kids Discover's entire editorial team has worked tirelessly in conjunction and in partnership with HMH to produce the HMH Kids Discover K-6 program that is up for adoption.

03:06:40.740 --> 03:06:56.767
The public commentary that's been voiced today and over the last several months forces a small company like mine to look at itself in the mirror, to pay close and special attention to the words that we've selected, the images we've chosen, the art that we've created in order to promote inclusion and support communities all across the state of California.

03:06:57.268 --> 03:07:08.553
I stand here today to say that you have been heard, that Kids Discover has heard you, and that adjustments have been made to the program within the parameters and procedures that the state affords us in order so that the program is in full compliance

03:07:09.093 --> 03:07:11.114
the California Education Code and State Framework.

03:07:11.494 --> 03:07:18.496
This program was created by good, hardworking, thoughtful professionals, people who show up every single day to put teachers and students first.

03:07:18.976 --> 03:07:20.356
This is in fact our livelihood.

03:07:20.996 --> 03:07:29.199
I would ask that the board members approve the HMH Kids Discover K-6 program based on the merit and objective quality of the program and not based on the public commentary.

03:07:29.699 --> 03:07:29.979
Thank you.

03:07:37.242 --> 03:07:44.024
Dear esteemed custodians of the future of the American students, I'm Harsha Shetbalkar, a resident of Folsom with kids in school.

03:07:45.624 --> 03:07:48.785
World is already a divided place, divided over ideas and beliefs.

03:07:50.065 --> 03:07:53.186
Equality and peace can be upheld only when we respect each other.

03:07:54.206 --> 03:08:00.047
In this particular case, we can promote equality by showing all civilizations in the same light.

03:08:00.948 --> 03:08:06.029
Indian civilization should not be thrashed while other civilizations are shown in spotlight.

03:08:07.089 --> 03:08:12.015
There are plenty of good aspects in the Indian civilization which has been around for about 6,000 years.

03:08:12.996 --> 03:08:18.262
I implore the respected board members to accept the IQC recommendations to reject hard code.

03:08:19.043 --> 03:08:25.711
This act will influence students to respect other civilizations and all Indian students to feel proud of their legacy.

03:08:25.931 --> 03:08:26.532
Thank you very much.

03:08:30.831 --> 03:08:31.191
Good morning.

03:08:31.231 --> 03:08:32.171
My name is Roy White.

03:08:32.191 --> 03:08:36.773
I'm an Air Force veteran, founder and president of a national organization called Truth in Textbooks.

03:08:37.313 --> 03:08:38.434
I live in Burney, Texas.

03:08:39.514 --> 03:08:43.055
TNT conducted reviews of 25 social studies textbooks.

03:08:43.135 --> 03:08:45.556
We have submitted a total of 21 of these reviews to you.

03:08:46.192 --> 03:08:50.633
totaling 336 pages, identifying 1,263 errors.

03:08:51.113 --> 03:08:53.794
The remaining reviews will be submitted in the coming weeks.

03:08:55.075 --> 03:09:02.177
The book with the most number of errors, 139, is Discovery, Education, Medieval, and Early Modern World History, Grade 7.

03:09:02.597 --> 03:09:10.619
Very close behind with 133 errors is the Pearson California History, Social Science, Grade 7 World History, Medieval, and Early Modern Times.

03:09:10.679 --> 03:09:15.401
We've conducted reviews in North Carolina, Texas, and we'll be conducting reviews in Florida.

03:09:16.291 --> 03:09:21.435
The public will be able to have access to these reports on our website at truthintextbooks.com.

03:09:21.915 --> 03:09:34.704
We do this as a public service to the California school administrators who wish to have an independent review of books under consideration in the coming months and in years hopes that they will purchase the most accurate textbooks adopted by the State Board of Education.

03:09:35.505 --> 03:09:39.808
I probably came further than anyone else for a one-minute speech, but thank you very much for your time.

03:09:43.459 --> 03:09:46.803
Good morning respected members of the State Board of Education.

03:09:47.244 --> 03:09:50.588
My name is Isha and I am an eighth grader at Winston Churchill Middle School.

03:09:51.269 --> 03:09:53.953
A bull — a bullying report on Hindu American children.

03:09:54.315 --> 03:10:03.680
says that one female in 10th grade noted that her classmates had frequently tried to convert her, and instructional content only created more negative impressions of Hinduism.

03:10:04.140 --> 03:10:14.545
She said, having an incomplete, brief, and completely generalized unit, which only focused on negative aspects of Hinduism, does not help to dispel the persistent stereotypes.

03:10:15.105 --> 03:10:20.848
I've seen too many friends give up on their faith and hide the Hindu identity to avoid being socially isolated.

03:10:21.588 --> 03:10:26.610
As a student in this age, I've also seen this happen to many of my friends.

03:10:27.511 --> 03:10:40.076
The guidelines for instructional material clearly states that their purpose is to enable all students to become aware and accepting of religious diversity while being allowed to remain secure in any religious beliefs they may already have.

03:10:40.736 --> 03:10:44.037
Then why are Hindu children not allowed to feel safe in their religious beliefs?

03:10:44.578 --> 03:10:45.318
Thank you for your time.

03:10:51.408 --> 03:10:52.189
Good morning, board.

03:10:52.609 --> 03:10:58.134
My name is Dr. Mari Zwick-Metrehi, and I'm here with the South Asian Histories for All Coalition.

03:10:58.794 --> 03:11:16.070
I'm one of the researchers behind the new report that we've submitted to you called Caste Survey of the United States, which shares the results of one of the first survey that documents quantitatively and qualitatively that caste discrimination very much exists in the United States.

03:11:16.790 --> 03:11:30.763
It directly contradicts false statements in textbooks like National Geographic, Teachers Curriculum, Pearsons, McGraw-Hill, that say that many Hindus, both in South Asia and the United States, don't identify with a caste.

03:11:31.364 --> 03:11:41.554
That makes it seem like caste doesn't exist, but our report has found that one in four Dalits in the United States experience physical assaults as a result of their caste.

03:11:42.354 --> 03:11:47.499
Two in three have faced discrimination in workplaces as a result of their caste in the United States.

03:11:48.179 --> 03:11:54.124
And one in three have reported discrimination in schools on the basis of their caste in the United States.

03:11:54.644 --> 03:12:05.233
And in fact, we found that caste discrimination touches every aspect of our caste-oppressed immigrant lives, from relationships to food to every institution we speak of.

03:12:05.854 --> 03:12:06.154
Thank you.

03:12:24.588 --> 03:12:25.114
Namaste.

03:12:25.603 --> 03:12:27.625
My name is Satsuka Yayavanam.

03:12:28.085 --> 03:12:32.168
I am a sixth grader from First Avenue Middle School in Southern California.

03:12:32.748 --> 03:12:41.775
I was appalled to hear Hindu students being bullied by other students in their class and also teachers making sarcastic comments on Hinduism.

03:12:42.295 --> 03:12:46.118
We will be learning about ancient India and Hinduism in a month or two.

03:12:46.638 --> 03:12:54.204
Now I'm starting to get worried to learn about Hinduism at school and no child should be scared to learn about their own religion.

03:12:55.024 --> 03:13:00.829
I am here to express my concern in wrongly portraying Hinduism in the California textbooks.

03:13:01.409 --> 03:13:06.994
I believe that you will take the right decision by dropping all the drafts that demonize Hinduism.

03:13:07.595 --> 03:13:17.983
This will set the right direction for children for the next 10 years and will be a remarkable step in teaching the right aspect about Hindu religion.

03:13:18.624 --> 03:13:22.927
This would be a great step in stopping bullying of Hindu children in schools.

03:13:23.268 --> 03:13:23.608
Thank you.

03:13:35.540 --> 03:13:38.162
Hi, my name is Rao Panaganti.

03:13:38.962 --> 03:13:46.407
I represent Vasavi Seva Foundation from Bay Area, which has 2,000 plus families.

03:13:47.308 --> 03:13:49.089
My children have grown up.

03:13:49.649 --> 03:13:58.635
Still, I came from San Jose to request you to remove the offensive material against Hinduism from California textbooks.

03:13:59.115 --> 03:14:02.258
Thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak here.

03:14:02.538 --> 03:14:02.818
Thank you.

03:14:09.738 --> 03:14:20.650
Dear members of the State Board of Education, I'm coming from the Bay Area and the mother of young children, and I stand in front of you to speak against the demonization of Hindus and Indians.

03:14:21.250 --> 03:14:28.198
I stand here as a Hindu, an Indian, as an Asian, with the support of other Asians and Pacific Islanders.

03:14:28.718 --> 03:14:34.662
I stand here to support Jeffrey Long and other academics who are seeking historical accuracy.

03:14:35.222 --> 03:14:47.490
We Hindus of diverse backgrounds and of all castes, vocations, communities, languages, and regions are here to demand that hatred against Hindus to be stopped.

03:14:48.050 --> 03:14:59.258
I comment IQC for rejecting the two Hindu phobic books that have the images that clearly depict Hinduism and India as a filthy backward culture.

03:15:00.079 --> 03:15:04.081
However, I think that this is not enough and much more needs to be done.

03:15:04.582 --> 03:15:09.805
I strongly urge SBE to say no to hatred against Hindus in all forms.

03:15:10.106 --> 03:15:10.426
Thank you.

03:15:16.687 --> 03:15:20.529
Hi, good afternoon, and dear members of State Board of Education.

03:15:21.090 --> 03:15:21.930
My name is Satish.

03:15:22.150 --> 03:15:24.932
I live in Milpitas, and I have two kids.

03:15:25.172 --> 03:15:28.034
Both go to elementary school in Milpitas.

03:15:28.374 --> 03:15:32.377
And I'm here to oppose Hinduphobia and Hatred Against My Heritage.

03:15:33.037 --> 03:15:40.282
I fully support IQC's decision to reject McCraw-Hill's K-6 and McCraw-Hill's 6-8 programs.

03:15:40.822 --> 03:15:43.804
These programs are blatantly racist and homophobic.

03:15:44.624 --> 03:15:48.608
There are several blatantly racist depictions and such portrayal.

03:15:48.689 --> 03:15:55.295
It shows Indian labourers working next to the monkey and thereby equating Indian labourers with the monkeys.

03:15:56.096 --> 03:15:59.580
And IQC has shown the courage to reject and prejudice by rejecting too.

03:16:00.481 --> 03:16:03.084
Hindu phobic books, but that is not enough.

03:16:03.324 --> 03:16:13.796
I support the recommendation of Academic Coalition by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other top academics requesting you to all to consider their recommendations and take it forward.

03:16:13.956 --> 03:16:14.196
Okay.

03:16:14.456 --> 03:16:14.777
Thank you.

03:16:20.382 --> 03:16:21.563
Hi, respected members.

03:16:21.683 --> 03:16:22.503
I'm Saurabh Sameya.

03:16:22.523 --> 03:16:38.712
I came here from Milpitas to put the concerns against the California textbooks has disturbing images of Indian and Hinduism and malign the image of Hindu, which is not the actual Hinduism is.

03:16:39.252 --> 03:16:47.517
So I request the suggestions made by IQC to remove the draft of HMH from 6 to 8.

03:16:48.759 --> 03:16:53.592
and not showing only the negative aspect of Hinduism in the textbooks.

03:16:53.733 --> 03:16:55.558
This gives a very wrong impression to the kids.

03:16:55.799 --> 03:16:56.340
Thank you very much.

03:17:01.420 --> 03:17:04.923
Respected SB members, my name is Satish Mahajan, living in San Jose.

03:17:05.264 --> 03:17:08.366
I'm a concerned parent of 10-year-old son Abhi, who is fifth grader.

03:17:09.067 --> 03:17:13.471
Hinduism, since Vedic time, has evolved with the contributions from diverse communities within.

03:17:13.971 --> 03:17:18.495
I feel proud that the communities like the one I belong to have greatly contributed to Hinduism.

03:17:19.016 --> 03:17:24.481
Male and female sages and saints from all these diverse communities help Hinduism grow, rejuvenate, and reform.

03:17:25.129 --> 03:17:27.891
they have been role models for Hindus all across social backgrounds.

03:17:28.392 --> 03:17:32.174
These are the kind of people that come to my mind when I think of Hinduism and its history.

03:17:32.675 --> 03:17:39.720
A group of academicians calling themselves South Asia Faculty Group, South Asian Histories for All, do not think so.

03:17:40.140 --> 03:17:48.326
They believe that saints and sages hailing from all these peasant communities, many times categorized as even outside of the Varna system, should be removed from the curriculum.

03:17:48.747 --> 03:17:53.210
It is like denying the contribution of masses as it does not fit in their theory of Hinduism.

03:17:53.971 --> 03:17:56.013
More importantly, let me ask a question.

03:17:56.193 --> 03:17:58.035
Who are these people from these organizations?

03:17:59.356 --> 03:18:04.901
Since 2014, I'm following the textbook issue, visiting social gatherings in Bay Area and many other places.

03:18:05.342 --> 03:18:07.324
I never interacted with these people from this organization.

03:18:07.504 --> 03:18:10.346
I request you to deny these people and their claims entirely.

03:18:10.427 --> 03:18:10.687
Thank you.

03:18:17.284 --> 03:18:18.824
Hello, good afternoon, board members.

03:18:19.345 --> 03:18:22.226
My name is Sanjeev Bhattavadekar from Pleasanton, California.

03:18:22.306 --> 03:18:26.467
My daughter goes to Pleasanton School District in fourth grade.

03:18:27.087 --> 03:18:30.568
I stand here to oppose hatred against Hindus and Indians.

03:18:31.769 --> 03:18:41.031
In the current textbook, sixth grade HMS calls Vedas, the sacred Hindu scriptures, a collection of spells and charms.

03:18:41.472 --> 03:18:42.312
Spells and charms.

03:18:43.232 --> 03:18:46.413
No other sacred book is mentioned in such denigrating terms.

03:18:46.813 --> 03:18:51.255
This is inaccurate, biased, and discriminatory.

03:18:52.115 --> 03:19:05.340
The California textbook standards is to project the cultural diversity of society, instill in each child a sense of pride in his or her heritage, develop a feeling of self-worth,

03:19:05.940 --> 03:19:15.870
and to enable all students to become aware and accepting of religious diversity while being allowed to remain secure in any religious belief they may already have.

03:19:16.350 --> 03:19:18.772
However, the current textbook format doesn't allow.

03:19:18.812 --> 03:19:21.135
They have overlooked even new format also.

03:19:21.175 --> 03:19:23.437
So, I support the letter.

03:19:23.657 --> 03:19:27.441
I fully support the decision by KC to reject HMH.

03:19:27.601 --> 03:19:27.861
Thank you.

03:19:37.935 --> 03:19:49.101
Respected members of State Board of Education, I'm Hindvi, sixth grader from Fremont, and I am highly disappointed at the way Hinduism and India are portrayed in the HMH, K-6, and other drafts.

03:19:49.541 --> 03:19:52.583
There are adverse reflections and historical inaccuracies.

03:19:53.083 --> 03:19:59.366
Apart from that, meaningful spiritual philosophies, such as belief in universal plurality, are completely ignored.

03:19:59.906 --> 03:20:06.770
Hinduism and India are represented in a demeaning way, which gives a wrong perception of me and my fellow Hindu friends.

03:20:07.290 --> 03:20:09.951
This is very insulting and needs to be corrected right away.

03:20:10.292 --> 03:20:15.974
We often end up having workshops and debates at class on falsified content such as caste system.

03:20:16.375 --> 03:20:19.636
This can encourage bullying and disrespecting Hinduism in India.

03:20:20.017 --> 03:20:23.158
I want rights of my fellow students and myself to be protected.

03:20:23.939 --> 03:20:30.882
I request the board to seriously consider the falsehood in drafts, reject them, and help bring the facts and correct content.

03:20:31.202 --> 03:20:34.064
I support IQC's rejection of hardcourt programs.

03:20:34.304 --> 03:20:34.604
Thank you.

03:20:41.918 --> 03:20:43.320
respected members of SD.

03:20:43.840 --> 03:20:45.022
Myself, Devapriya.

03:20:45.142 --> 03:20:53.530
I'm from Kupatuna, a concerned parent of a four-year-old son who is going to preschool now, and he'll be going to public school from the next year.

03:20:53.550 --> 03:21:00.858
So I'm here to stand against the, you know, hatred against the Hinduism, all the Indian civilization, which is happening in the California textbooks.

03:21:01.358 --> 03:21:10.803
And I'm really worried to see that what will happen to my son when he's going to school from next year and he'll be bullied by his fellow friends and how he'll come back.

03:21:10.863 --> 03:21:16.326
But today I see a difference when he goes to school, happily he's coming back, you know, with his friends, playing.

03:21:16.906 --> 03:21:21.929
But I don't know what will happen tomorrow when he's going to read his books and then, you know, being bullied by his friends.

03:21:22.589 --> 03:21:28.252
Having that said, I have been following up with these hearings for quite a long time.

03:21:28.312 --> 03:21:32.655
And I was part of the hearing from the IQC team last time.

03:21:33.015 --> 03:21:40.559
And I was really happy in their support towards rejecting a couple of publishers' content in the books.

03:21:41.240 --> 03:21:49.224
And I am urging you today to reject all the other publishers who are putting the wrong contents and putting the Hindu civilization in a bad way.

03:21:49.785 --> 03:21:51.566
So thank you for the time and listening to me.

03:22:00.339 --> 03:22:06.968
Respected members of the State Board of Education, I am Sharanya Jhavi, a sixth grader from the Pleasanton Unified School District.

03:22:07.508 --> 03:22:16.680
I noticed that India and Hinduism are portrayed incorrectly in my textbook, and I believe this needs to be corrected immediately.

03:22:17.561 --> 03:22:18.402
It is insulting.

03:22:19.002 --> 03:22:30.488
A bullying report on Hindu-American children says that a student who was bullied said that, I was at lunch and it was after we learned about Hinduism they started saying my religion is a devil's religion and that I'll go to hell.

03:22:30.888 --> 03:22:33.029
This clearly points to the problems with textbooks.

03:22:33.430 --> 03:22:39.313
I stand here in solidarity with all Hindu-American children who have been bullied because of hatred created by bad textbooks.

03:22:39.934 --> 03:22:43.962
Why are Hindu children not allowed to feel safe in their religious beliefs?

03:22:44.323 --> 03:22:49.835
I urge the board to reject all material that has hatred against Hindus and every other community.

03:22:49.915 --> 03:22:50.236
Thank you.

03:22:55.134 --> 03:22:57.495
Namaste, member of state board of education.

03:22:58.236 --> 03:23:03.019
I thank and fully support the decision of IQC to reject the two programs of HMH.

03:23:03.539 --> 03:23:09.243
Even after the huge number of revisions and rewrites submitted this collectively doesn't address all the problems.

03:23:09.803 --> 03:23:16.307
Every one out of three Hindu American children has reported being bullied based on their religious belief and practices.

03:23:16.887 --> 03:23:21.931
Many children have said that bullying occurred after the section on Hinduism and ancient Indian

03:23:22.631 --> 03:23:23.612
were taught in schools.

03:23:23.913 --> 03:23:29.820
Hence, it is extremely important that the hatred and the bias in the textbooks be addressed immediately.

03:23:30.541 --> 03:23:35.588
I am Sethanshu Swaprasad Samal from Hayward, working as a software professional in Silicon Valley.

03:23:36.048 --> 03:23:39.373
I am a proud Hindu and also father of a two-year-old son.

03:23:40.279 --> 03:23:47.842
who will be exposed to the negative effects of the inaccurate information about Indian civilizations in all those textbooks in few years.

03:23:48.162 --> 03:23:52.304
Hence, I ask you to reject HMS2 programs as recommended by IQC.

03:23:52.444 --> 03:23:52.824
Thank you all.

03:23:59.341 --> 03:24:02.964
Respected members of SBE, I'm Sunil Rath from Sunnyvale.

03:24:04.245 --> 03:24:07.728
I'm standing with the Hindu students who are bullied by their fellow classmates.

03:24:08.508 --> 03:24:11.231
I stand here to oppose the hatred against Hindus and Indians.

03:24:11.951 --> 03:24:17.736
I support IQC's decision to reject HMH K-6 and HMH 6-8 programs.

03:24:18.156 --> 03:24:22.179
In many places, HMH has not even submitted what those replacements would be.

03:24:22.960 --> 03:24:26.663
How could a draft textbook be adopted when it is not even complete?

03:24:27.804 --> 03:24:32.030
Hence, I ask you to reject HMS-II programs as recommended by IQC.

03:24:32.270 --> 03:24:36.897
I support the recommendations of Academic Coalition by Professor Geoffrey Long and 30th Order Academies.

03:24:37.377 --> 03:24:38.879
Please take all their recommendations.

03:24:39.059 --> 03:24:39.340
Thank you.

03:24:43.991 --> 03:24:47.614
To the respected members of the state's board of education.

03:24:47.694 --> 03:24:49.175
My name is Shreya Cola.

03:24:49.855 --> 03:24:53.678
I attend Warm Springs Elementary School and I'm in 6th grade.

03:24:54.159 --> 03:24:57.621
A report was filed for bullying a Hindu American student.

03:24:57.961 --> 03:25:03.225
The student says and I quote I was at lunch and it was after we learned about Hinduism.

03:25:03.606 --> 03:25:07.829
They started saying my religion is a devil's religion and that I'll go to hell.

03:25:08.249 --> 03:25:11.151
This clearly points to the problems with our textbooks.

03:25:11.652 --> 03:25:13.213
I stand here in solidarity.

03:25:13.649 --> 03:25:20.492
with all the Hindu American children who have been bullied because of hatred created by bad textbooks.

03:25:21.132 --> 03:25:25.554
Why are Hindu children not allowed to feel safe in their religious beliefs?

03:25:26.034 --> 03:25:33.438
I strongly urge the board to reject all material that has hatred against the Hindus and every other community.

03:25:33.618 --> 03:25:34.018
Thank you.

03:25:42.219 --> 03:25:48.023
Respected board members, I am Shruti Pathak, and I'm a ninth grader at EVHS High School, Evergreen Valley High School.

03:25:48.524 --> 03:25:55.149
I would like to start by saying I support the decision to reject the books from HMH, which display an intentionally negative portrayal of Hinduism.

03:25:55.829 --> 03:25:57.571
However, the effort is still not over.

03:25:57.991 --> 03:26:03.795
Drafts from National Geographic, as well as McGraw-Hill, still have blatantly racist content that promote Hinduphobia.

03:26:04.476 --> 03:26:09.460
If accepted, these books will continue to initiate bullying and create tension in schools for Hindu children.

03:26:10.260 --> 03:26:17.666
A report from the Hindu American Foundation states that one of three Hindu American children have complained of bullying based on their culture and beliefs.

03:26:18.266 --> 03:26:19.868
That is not a statistic to be proud of.

03:26:20.568 --> 03:26:26.392
I stand here in support with my fellow Hindu American children who stand victim to such hateful content.

03:26:26.693 --> 03:26:26.973
Thank you.

03:26:31.636 --> 03:26:39.801
Hi, I'm Lakshmi Nagarajan, member of Ambedkar Kin Study Circle, here today representing the South Asian history for all.

03:26:40.281 --> 03:26:44.904
Sir, madam, I see the Cupertino kids here saying that they are bullied.

03:26:45.304 --> 03:26:46.945
90% of Cupertino population is Asian.

03:26:47.365 --> 03:26:49.166
Are we saying we are bullying ourselves?

03:26:49.747 --> 03:26:50.247
I don't get it.

03:26:50.867 --> 03:26:55.190
And blacks were treated like slaves, but that is not removed from the history.

03:26:55.790 --> 03:26:58.232
So my point is the students have

03:26:59.731 --> 03:27:03.132
need to learn, study, fact as fact, reality as reality.

03:27:03.672 --> 03:27:07.853
The future generation needs more courage to annihilate the caste.

03:27:08.653 --> 03:27:13.234
The first and foremost step to annihilate the caste is to accept its existence.

03:27:13.694 --> 03:27:19.676
IQC framework reads that the caste system provides social stability and gave the identity to each community.

03:27:20.156 --> 03:27:22.136
Stacks contrast to this.

03:27:22.716 --> 03:27:26.577
Crimes committed against Dalits by non-Dalits is every 16 minutes.

03:27:26.597 --> 03:27:28.678
90 crimes a day, every day.

03:27:29.258 --> 03:27:31.300
Four Dalit women are raped by non-Dalits.

03:27:31.781 --> 03:27:37.767
And every week, 13 Dalits are murdered and six Dalits are kidnapped.

03:27:37.887 --> 03:27:41.871
And are we still saying that it's going to give the stability?

03:27:48.083 --> 03:27:49.264
Good afternoon, respected members.

03:27:49.524 --> 03:27:55.468
I'm Karthikeyan Shanmugha, member of Ambedkar King Study Circle, California, here today representing South Asian history for all.

03:27:56.089 --> 03:28:02.934
Sassan, madam, my request today is to expand a little bit of the Gupta dynasty, which covers in the grade seven.

03:28:03.434 --> 03:28:08.380
So Gupta dynasty covers between the 6th and 3rd and 6th century AD, which is partial.

03:28:08.840 --> 03:28:11.183
It stops with saying that the Gupta period is a golden period.

03:28:11.403 --> 03:28:19.353
Request you to elaborate how the caste system become irreparably rigid during the Gupta dynasty by stopping sub-caste or jati mobility.

03:28:19.953 --> 03:28:25.455
It is during the Gupta period, Brahmins firmly established their social status by monopolizing education, art and culture.

03:28:26.035 --> 03:28:26.395
Sati.

03:28:27.095 --> 03:28:32.717
Widows were forced to burn themselves on the funeral pyre of their husbands as a practice was introduced in the very dynasty.

03:28:33.417 --> 03:28:40.939
According to Dr. B R Ambedkar, it is during this very period, untouchability was introduced by making cow killing as a sin and beef-eating as an offense.

03:28:41.579 --> 03:28:48.981
As secular Indian historians put that during the rule of Gupta, Indian society becomes Aryan patriarchal society.

03:28:49.422 --> 03:28:50.826
without understanding how the.

03:28:51.287 --> 03:28:51.628
Thank you.

03:28:55.721 --> 03:28:56.544
Good afternoon, everyone.

03:28:57.176 --> 03:28:58.557
respected members of SBE.

03:28:59.537 --> 03:29:02.239
I'm Bhaskar Vempati, father of an eight-year-old.

03:29:02.599 --> 03:29:06.182
I support the recommendations by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other academicians.

03:29:06.722 --> 03:29:11.865
I commend and fully support the decision of IQC to reject the two programs of HMH.

03:29:12.305 --> 03:29:16.628
These programs are blatantly racist, Hinduphobic, homophobic, and worse in quality.

03:29:17.108 --> 03:29:20.090
There are numerous violations of Category 1 of adoption guidelines.

03:29:20.590 --> 03:29:25.573
especially Category 1.10, which prohibits the adverse reflection based on religion and ethnicity.

03:29:26.133 --> 03:29:29.935
They also violate the California law, which prohibits religious discrimination.

03:29:30.495 --> 03:29:32.757
For example, it has caricatures of Hindu deities.

03:29:33.217 --> 03:29:38.059
HMH 628 calls Vedas, the sacred Hindu text, as a collection of spells and charms.

03:29:38.259 --> 03:29:42.202
My ask is to reject the racism publishers like McGraw-Hill, HMH, and Discovery.

03:29:42.622 --> 03:29:44.703
Thank you for listening, and thank you once again.

03:29:57.463 --> 03:30:02.109
Namaste, respected members of State Board of Education.

03:30:02.629 --> 03:30:08.216
My name is Shwani Kollat and Arrington High School and I'm studying in 10th grade.

03:30:08.696 --> 03:30:12.360
I stand here to oppose hatred against Hindus and Indians.

03:30:13.121 --> 03:30:15.184
A 11th grader from Missouri City,

03:30:15.684 --> 03:30:24.054
Texas was told by her classmates that she should convert to Christianity to become more civilized.

03:30:24.655 --> 03:30:28.720
This, I believe, is because Hindus are primitive, dirty, and bad.

03:30:29.221 --> 03:30:33.085
Do we not see the pictures in the textbooks that do that?

03:30:33.946 --> 03:30:42.674
I'm here to support Jeffrey Long and 38 other academicians who are seeking historical accuracy.

03:30:43.595 --> 03:30:53.163
I request that recommendations by Jeffrey Long and the academic group be accepted to address all the problems.

03:30:53.263 --> 03:30:53.764
Thank you.

03:31:01.806 --> 03:31:03.607
Good afternoon members of the SPE.

03:31:03.688 --> 03:31:06.870
Thank you for providing this forum and listening carefully to our grievances.

03:31:07.390 --> 03:31:08.752
I'm a parent of a fifth grader.

03:31:09.232 --> 03:31:16.578
I'm afraid that next year in middle school he may experience shame and confusion due to religious history curriculum as depicted in the disputed texts.

03:31:17.138 --> 03:31:20.401
The content in HMH texts are especially outrageous.

03:31:21.081 --> 03:31:25.505
These being textbooks and not opinion columns, I insist that they be unbiased and accurate.

03:31:26.465 --> 03:31:33.614
The beauty of Hindu religion lies in the fact that there are numerous interweaving bays that it provides to reach God and self-realization.

03:31:34.035 --> 03:31:41.685
But instead of providing these principles, I found in the text what it had was misrepresentation, distortion, and critical positive omissions.

03:31:42.762 --> 03:31:50.267
Pictures are worth a thousand words, and most of the pictures in these texts, especially the HMH text, are really outrageous.

03:31:50.867 --> 03:31:54.289
They are derogatory, irrelevant, biased, primitive, and condescending.

03:31:54.449 --> 03:31:55.250
I can keep going on.

03:31:55.910 --> 03:31:59.733
These absolutely need to be replaced with appropriate ones which are more respectful.

03:32:00.413 --> 03:32:08.959
Hinduism is an ancient religion, but is very current and very relevant religion in modern times, and should be presented with the same reverence as other modern religions.

03:32:10.400 --> 03:32:18.074
Hence, I support the IQC decision to reject the curriculum and also support the academics strive for accuracy.

03:32:18.115 --> 03:32:18.736
Thank you very much.

03:32:26.775 --> 03:32:27.295
Namaste.

03:32:27.796 --> 03:32:28.476
Jai Shri Ram.

03:32:29.036 --> 03:32:30.117
My name is Nitin Barve.

03:32:30.217 --> 03:32:31.518
I'm a resident of Cupertino.

03:32:32.218 --> 03:32:33.359
I have a sixth grader boy.

03:32:34.039 --> 03:32:38.622
And I started noticing some differences in him when he comes back home.

03:32:39.262 --> 03:32:41.643
He has been a very proud practitioner Hindu.

03:32:42.264 --> 03:32:45.406
And recently, I've started seeing some elements of doubt on his face.

03:32:45.946 --> 03:32:47.026
And I cannot accept that.

03:32:48.467 --> 03:32:49.808
These are formative years.

03:32:50.028 --> 03:32:54.511
We all know that society around us is very divisive, full of hatred and bigotry.

03:32:55.211 --> 03:32:57.231
And the last thing we want to do is add to that.

03:32:58.932 --> 03:33:00.692
The middle school years are very formative.

03:33:00.772 --> 03:33:03.773
These are the years which shape the rest of your life.

03:33:04.433 --> 03:33:12.335
And it's your responsibility to make sure that the text that you present to them is adequate, correct, and complete.

03:33:12.895 --> 03:33:18.056
And the last thing you want to do is present them with any confusing, inadequate, incorrect material.

03:33:19.196 --> 03:33:28.473
So I request you to, in fact, I sincerely hope and demand that you think about it very responsibly and accept all the recommendations made by Professor Long.

03:33:29.495 --> 03:33:29.755
Thank you.

03:33:37.057 --> 03:33:39.899
Respected board members of education, I'm Rashmita Halkar.

03:33:40.019 --> 03:33:42.861
I'm mother of a fourth grader from Fremont Unified School District.

03:33:43.381 --> 03:33:52.266
I'm here to express my full support to IQC's decision to reject HMH text for K to K6 and 6 to 8.

03:33:53.087 --> 03:33:57.850
And I support the recommendations of top experts and Professor Jeffrey Long.

03:33:59.471 --> 03:34:09.663
If a kid gets bullied and feels embarrassed because of his or her ethnicity or cultural background, as a parent, it concerns me.

03:34:10.183 --> 03:34:13.927
Specifically, if a kid is learning this from textbook and teachers.

03:34:15.285 --> 03:34:18.046
This is a negative impact of classroom education.

03:34:18.486 --> 03:34:27.711
Hindu culture has a great contribution to the mankind, which he can or she can discuss with his classmates and teachers.

03:34:28.131 --> 03:34:30.532
For example, invention of zero yoga and meditation.

03:34:30.992 --> 03:34:34.134
Just think about the positive impact that he will have.

03:34:35.814 --> 03:34:37.315
by learning yoga and meditation.

03:34:38.155 --> 03:34:42.317
Specifically, it is important in today's stressful life.

03:34:42.617 --> 03:34:48.439
So I am, I fully support the IQC's decision and reject HMIT textbook.

03:34:48.659 --> 03:34:49.019
Thank you.

03:35:00.884 --> 03:35:01.024
Yeah.

03:35:02.591 --> 03:35:05.574
Good morning, respected board members.

03:35:08.317 --> 03:35:09.819
My name is Ashok Chigulapalli.

03:35:10.099 --> 03:35:12.501
I come from Fremont, Fremont School District.

03:35:12.602 --> 03:35:13.402
I have two daughters.

03:35:14.083 --> 03:35:17.026
One has completed college, the other one is a high school senior here.

03:35:17.847 --> 03:35:25.155
I'm happy to see that IQCA has rejected the two books from HMH, the intentionally negative

03:35:25.795 --> 03:35:32.360
and the incoherent portrayal of Hinduism by HMH does not deserve a place in our school.

03:35:33.120 --> 03:35:43.548
Given the current as well as proposed draft contents of some of the publishers, it is no surprise to me that one in eight Hindu-American

03:35:44.308 --> 03:35:54.358
Respondents of a bullying survey said that their teachers made sarcastic remarks about Hinduism in front of the entire class.

03:35:55.239 --> 03:36:03.907
11th grade from Missouri City, Texas was told by her classmates that she should convert to Christianity to become more.

03:36:04.568 --> 03:36:04.888
Thank you.

03:36:05.089 --> 03:36:05.489
Please continue.

03:36:11.132 --> 03:36:15.477
Respected members of State Board of Education, I am Balaji Kesarla from Dublin, California.

03:36:15.937 --> 03:36:18.580
I stand here to oppose hatred against Hindus and Indians.

03:36:19.101 --> 03:36:23.045
Imagine you are an Indian parent eagerly waiting for your child to come home from middle school.

03:36:23.425 --> 03:36:24.066
When they come home,

03:36:24.500 --> 03:36:29.783
Your child tells you, mom or dad, read this book and you read it and you come across a page about India.

03:36:29.983 --> 03:36:33.365
You get excited to see a page in a published textbook about your own culture.

03:36:33.785 --> 03:36:38.427
But as you read it, your excitement vanishes because the page is offensive, not exciting.

03:36:38.908 --> 03:36:39.668
That is why I'm here.

03:36:40.048 --> 03:36:45.071
A lot of Indian parents experience this after their children tell them what they study in social studies.

03:36:45.511 --> 03:36:46.852
I don't think any would want their

03:36:47.572 --> 03:36:50.395
anyone would want their culture to be offended in a published textbook.

03:36:50.575 --> 03:36:55.499
This is having adverse effects as it is spreading hatred among kids and Indian kids are being bullied due to this.

03:36:56.059 --> 03:36:59.582
We want all children to be respectful of each other and not to bully or hate each other.

03:37:00.042 --> 03:37:05.267
I'm really hoping that the board members are going to reject HMH2 programs as recommended by IQSU.

03:37:05.487 --> 03:37:06.608
Thank you and have a wonderful day.

03:37:11.892 --> 03:37:16.236
Respected members of State Board of Education, I'm Prashanth Andreddy, father of two kids.

03:37:16.872 --> 03:37:20.974
My son, the other one, goes to the Russell Ranch Elementary School in Folsom.

03:37:21.834 --> 03:37:24.475
I stand here to oppose hatred against Hindus and Indians.

03:37:25.315 --> 03:37:30.257
I fully support the decision of IQC to reject the two programs of HMH.

03:37:31.257 --> 03:37:38.420
NF has already said about, you know, the day long, you know, my friends have been talking about the vilification of the Indian culture and Hindus and all that.

03:37:38.660 --> 03:37:40.381
So I'm not going to repeat all that stuff.

03:37:41.261 --> 03:37:47.645
Keeping this inaccuracies aside, please think about the negative impact it has on the young impressionable minds.

03:37:48.446 --> 03:37:51.628
How it will impact their self-esteem, especially the Indian-American kids.

03:37:52.468 --> 03:37:56.451
One in every three Indian-American kids are subjected to bullying.

03:37:57.031 --> 03:37:58.913
These publications only make matters worse.

03:37:59.973 --> 03:38:02.195
Eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.

03:38:03.075 --> 03:38:08.239
Hence, I request you to reject HMS2 programs as recommended by IQC.

03:38:08.719 --> 03:38:09.900
Thanks for giving me a chance to speak.

03:38:10.080 --> 03:38:10.340
Thank you.

03:38:15.686 --> 03:38:18.709
Respected panel members, thanks for giving me this opportunity.

03:38:18.909 --> 03:38:19.830
I'm Krishna Uttakuru.

03:38:19.950 --> 03:38:25.495
I'm a member of Livermore Hindu Community Center and I'm also a member of Virat Hindustan Association.

03:38:26.515 --> 03:38:27.857
I want to tell you all a small story.

03:38:28.137 --> 03:38:36.304
Poor little Johnny had a cancerous tumor in the stomach and his parents took him to a dentist and poor little Johnny died because of wrong medicine and wrong diagnosis.

03:38:36.900 --> 03:38:43.303
The reason why I'm telling you this story is what kind of credentials does the authors of this textbook have to write about Hinduism?

03:38:43.423 --> 03:38:44.523
Do they understand Sanskrit?

03:38:45.023 --> 03:38:46.964
Did they read any Hindu literature to understand?

03:38:47.565 --> 03:38:53.107
And one of the speakers was talking about Dalits getting atrocized and discriminated in Hindu culture.

03:38:53.707 --> 03:38:59.650
But the authors of popular textbooks like Vedas, like Vedavyasa is a Dalit and Valmiki is a Dalit.

03:38:59.810 --> 03:39:00.730
They are not Brahmins.

03:39:01.150 --> 03:39:03.672
And all the demons like Ravana, Narakasura were Brahmins.

03:39:03.732 --> 03:39:08.654
So dharma or the righteousness was always given place in Hinduism and not the caste.

03:39:09.114 --> 03:39:17.278
So I request you to reject all the textbook content which is having anti-Hindu rhetoric and which is causing all the kids in the California schools getting bullied.

03:39:17.418 --> 03:39:17.738
Thank you.

03:39:23.424 --> 03:39:24.224
Good afternoon, board.

03:39:25.205 --> 03:39:26.145
My name is Umashankar.

03:39:26.225 --> 03:39:28.206
I'm a ninth grader.

03:39:29.066 --> 03:39:36.808
My daughter is a ninth grader at Livermore Unified School District, and I'm also representing Hindu community and cultural center in Livermore.

03:39:37.268 --> 03:39:41.650
I also represent Vasavi Seva Foundation, which has about 2,000 plus families in Bay Area.

03:39:42.170 --> 03:39:45.531
I also represent an Indian connecting group at a major tech firm in Bay Area.

03:39:46.251 --> 03:39:57.994
I've taken off today to come to express my concerns on the syllabus that HMH K-6 and HMH 6-8 as published in the textbooks of 6th grade social studies.

03:39:58.615 --> 03:40:03.076
The IQC's rejection of it is the right way to go and I'm here to fully support it.

03:40:03.776 --> 03:40:08.020
The bullying report from the Hindu American Foundation shows what kids go through.

03:40:08.460 --> 03:40:20.550
I quote the experience of one of the students in a school saying that I was at lunch and it was after we learned about Hinduism in the textbook, they started saying my religion is a devil's religion and that I'll go to hell.

03:40:20.951 --> 03:40:23.713
That was really sickening to hear and it is not good.

03:40:24.333 --> 03:40:29.217
I fully support the recommendations of Professor Long and other academicians to fix this problem.

03:40:29.438 --> 03:40:29.698
Thank you.

03:40:33.996 --> 03:40:34.756
Namaste everyone.

03:40:35.036 --> 03:40:35.857
My name is Naveen.

03:40:36.357 --> 03:40:44.039
I fully support the letter by Mr. Professor Jeffrey Long, 438 Academics and IRQ's decision to reject HMH books.

03:40:44.499 --> 03:40:47.720
Please let Hindu people, kids live with pride and dignity.

03:40:48.261 --> 03:40:53.682
Please do not encourage and spread the racist, biased values and hate in this society.

03:40:54.142 --> 03:40:55.643
There are millions of good things

03:40:56.533 --> 03:41:01.643
to share why few textbooks only printing the negative things against the Hinduism.

03:41:02.144 --> 03:41:08.195
Please don't let my kid face horrific terrible bullying in the school because he is a Hindu, Indian or Asian kid.

03:41:08.455 --> 03:41:09.137
Thank you so much.

03:41:15.475 --> 03:41:17.657
Good afternoon, respected members of the State Board of Education.

03:41:17.977 --> 03:41:22.941
I am Raj Nagaraj from San Ramon, California, and a parent of two boys in high school and elementary school.

03:41:23.921 --> 03:41:26.663
I stand here to oppose hatred against Hindus and Indians.

03:41:27.364 --> 03:41:32.508
I also support the IQC's decision in rejecting HMH books for K-6 and 6-8.

03:41:33.288 --> 03:41:38.052
Further, I support the recommendations made by Professor Jefferson Long and 38 other academics.

03:41:38.912 --> 03:41:41.996
I appealed the chair of the SP to accept their recommendations.

03:41:42.877 --> 03:41:54.871
I would like to bring to your notice that one in eight respondents of a bullying survey on the Hindu American children said that his teachers made sarcastic remarks about Hinduism in front of the entire class.

03:41:56.192 --> 03:41:59.895
I don't tell anybody else I was a Hindu, so I don't experience problems so much.

03:41:59.995 --> 03:42:01.056
I feel awkward sometimes.

03:42:01.777 --> 03:42:03.598
These were the words by the student.

03:42:04.379 --> 03:42:07.861
Others also reported deep emotional scars from bullying incidents.

03:42:08.642 --> 03:42:15.567
I stand with you, these children, who are facing bullying and hatred, and demand that hatred against Hinduism must be immediately stopped.

03:42:16.107 --> 03:42:16.668
Thank you very much.

03:42:21.371 --> 03:42:23.153
Good afternoon, Namaste, and board members.

03:42:23.981 --> 03:42:25.322
My name is Govind Ranganathan.

03:42:25.362 --> 03:42:28.764
Two of my kids are in the middle school in the present and unified school district.

03:42:29.404 --> 03:42:38.769
And my wife and I were shocked when we saw the books in what they depicted on Hinduism, the stereotyping, and that resulted in shaming and bullying of my kids.

03:42:38.929 --> 03:42:41.531
And they felt ashamed to be Hindu, which is kind of not good.

03:42:42.231 --> 03:42:48.755
So a religion that has given ahimsa, non-violence, that has given karma, that has given yoga, and

03:42:49.475 --> 03:42:56.438
And if you're in a country of land, liberty, and equality, where you're being shamed because you're a one religion, which is unacceptable, which should not be.

03:42:56.578 --> 03:42:58.659
All of us should rise up and say it is unacceptable.

03:42:59.619 --> 03:43:06.943
So I demand that please implement the recommendations by Professor Jeffrey Long and 30 other talk academics.

03:43:07.443 --> 03:43:09.183
And I appreciate your patience and listening.

03:43:09.784 --> 03:43:12.025
And thanks for your help in this just cause.

03:43:12.285 --> 03:43:12.545
Thank you.

03:43:19.707 --> 03:43:20.988
Good afternoon, this is Lakshman.

03:43:24.753 --> 03:43:26.555
So I'm a father of a fifth grader.

03:43:26.735 --> 03:43:30.920
When I saw this new draft from the HMH book, I was really shocked.

03:43:30.980 --> 03:43:33.483
The front page says about unicorn.

03:43:33.683 --> 03:43:39.029
I don't see this unicorn has any place in Indian history or mythology.

03:43:39.992 --> 03:44:08.581
all the pages like the pictures for Hindu religion point of view they have the pictures like laborers working with monkeys there are some so they are not teaching any good thing what Hinduism gave so what I want be teach the fact but be fair with all the religions like Hinduism, Sikhism or Buddhism so I want these kids when they learn from the book they respect each other

03:44:09.381 --> 03:44:16.252
It's not like they are getting bullied because Hinduism is portrayed in a negative way.

03:44:16.412 --> 03:44:23.363
So, I fully support IQC recommendation and reject HMH books.

03:44:23.743 --> 03:44:23.984
Thank you.

03:44:30.450 --> 03:44:33.472
I'm Dandapani from Ambedkar King Study Circle, California.

03:44:33.752 --> 03:44:37.594
I'm here today representing a broader coalition, South Asian Histories for All.

03:44:38.275 --> 03:44:49.962
Sirs and Madam, on October 28, 2017 in Uttar Pradesh, India, an eight-month-old pregnant woman was attacked brutally and murdered by the upper caste Hindus for the reason that she touched their trash can.

03:44:50.882 --> 03:44:55.265
The poor victim belonged to an oppressed caste who were forced to do manual scavenging for generations.

03:44:55.806 --> 03:44:59.588
As per Dr. Ambedkar, caste is a state of mind, it's a disease of mind.

03:44:59.949 --> 03:45:02.490
The teachings of the Hindu religion are the root cause of this disease.

03:45:03.431 --> 03:45:07.774
The future generation should learn about origin of caste and it shouldn't be delinked from Hinduism.

03:45:08.354 --> 03:45:13.824
If we don't call this out and accept its existence and cruelty of the caste system, it's going to stay longer.

03:45:14.245 --> 03:45:20.616
So please keep the caste oppression and send the books back to IQC and kindly enforce the framework, fix the mistakes.

03:45:20.796 --> 03:45:21.077
Thank you.

03:45:26.718 --> 03:45:27.739
Good afternoon, everyone.

03:45:28.179 --> 03:45:36.783
I'm Shanti Kadiresan, member of Ambedkar Study Circle, here today representing Border Coalition of South Asian Histories for All Coalition.

03:45:37.404 --> 03:45:39.245
I'm living in this country for 20 years.

03:45:39.425 --> 03:45:46.809
And in these 20 years, majority of the people, whomever I met, asked my caste directly or indirectly.

03:45:47.189 --> 03:45:54.213
Because unlike other Indian states, people from Tamil Nadu don't carry the caste or family name as their surname.

03:45:54.773 --> 03:45:57.955
I'm pretty sure it's a case of my friends here from both sides.

03:45:58.556 --> 03:46:04.600
So please modify the sentence in the framework that today many Hindus in India and in U.S.

03:46:04.660 --> 03:46:07.943
do not identify themselves as belonging to caste.

03:46:08.423 --> 03:46:11.606
Today majority of the Hindus in India and in U.S.

03:46:11.746 --> 03:46:16.489
identify themselves as belonging to a caste with a very few exception.

03:46:17.010 --> 03:46:20.893
So I humbly request you guys to delay the vote and fix the mistake.

03:46:20.953 --> 03:46:21.273
Thank you.

03:46:26.462 --> 03:46:27.868
Good afternoon, board members.

03:46:28.048 --> 03:46:29.554
My name is Nachia P. Kumar.

03:46:29.876 --> 03:46:32.285
I am from the same state that the person who just spoke before me.

03:46:34.505 --> 03:46:38.508
I have a son who's a sixth grader, goes to Southern California school here.

03:46:39.249 --> 03:46:41.410
I'm also an educator and a yoga instructor.

03:46:41.771 --> 03:46:43.492
I've been practicing yoga for generations.

03:46:44.253 --> 03:46:45.694
I'm not from one of those higher castes.

03:46:46.434 --> 03:46:49.937
We are not oppressed with any of the things that's mentioned in there.

03:46:50.277 --> 03:46:56.161
So when I see these books stereotyping, has stereotyped narratives, it just hardens my mind.

03:46:56.341 --> 03:46:57.022
It's not the truth.

03:46:58.723 --> 03:47:03.787
So I request the board to reject HMH and McGraw-Hill drafts for violating the California framework.

03:47:05.168 --> 03:47:10.211
Another violation is it is decoupling practices such as meditation from Hinduism.

03:47:11.833 --> 03:47:17.096
The law of this land prohibits any stereotypes and patronizing of minority groups.

03:47:17.557 --> 03:47:25.382
I believe this board has the wisdom to do what the law requires and do the right thing to protect the young American Hindu children.

03:47:25.803 --> 03:47:26.063
Thank you.

03:47:30.089 --> 03:47:32.094
Good afternoon, dear members of SBE.

03:47:33.297 --> 03:47:36.946
My name is Madhu Gururajachar, father of two children who attend California schools.

03:47:38.027 --> 03:47:41.028
National Geographic's materials are severely outdated.

03:47:41.788 --> 03:47:51.170
They completely disregard the new social, the history social framework adopted by the State Board in 2016 and they leave out 20 key topics in the framework.

03:47:51.870 --> 03:47:59.832
Examples of such omissions include the complete failure to mention positive contributions of Hinduism like the Bhagavad Gita, contributions

03:48:00.772 --> 03:48:04.213
by Hindus to mathematics, medicine, etc.

03:48:05.214 --> 03:48:14.857
National Geographic also tries to create a false equivalence of Hinduism with caste, which in turn is erroneously portrayed as the primary defining characteristic of the Hindu practice.

03:48:15.577 --> 03:48:25.461
I respectfully submit that the National Geographic book should adopt all the recommendations or else it should be rejected.

03:48:25.701 --> 03:48:25.961
Thank you.

03:48:32.438 --> 03:48:33.399
Good afternoon, everyone.

03:48:33.739 --> 03:48:37.941
My name is Anupama Rao, and I'm a mother of two children studying in Santa Clara.

03:48:38.521 --> 03:48:45.585
My son went through the upsetting experience of being taught highly Hinduphobic content when he was in his sixth grade.

03:48:45.945 --> 03:48:57.151
And it was very difficult for me as a mother who identifies with my religion and my identity to be able to communicate and convey to him that what he was learning in his textbooks was completely inaccurate.

03:48:58.283 --> 03:49:07.774
It is really important for textbooks, which serve as an irreplaceably critical role in children's learning, to stay away from inaccuracies of this nature.

03:49:08.215 --> 03:49:17.385
So we are, through the education medium, rooting out any implicit and explicit biases that our children grow up with as they grow up in this community.

03:49:18.368 --> 03:49:34.434
I really request all of you that you support the IQC recommendation to reject the HMH textbooks and urge them to adopt all of the recommendations of academic coalition by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other top academics.

03:49:34.674 --> 03:49:34.974
Thank you.

03:49:38.948 --> 03:49:41.971
Hi, sorry you all are eating through this thing.

03:49:43.092 --> 03:49:43.913
My name is Dolly.

03:49:44.013 --> 03:49:48.899
I'm a Dalit American and I'm also a physician assistant and I'm with South Asian Histories for All.

03:49:49.720 --> 03:49:56.628
I submitted the legal notice to the board so that we could protect the rights of the caste oppressed and enforce the frameworks and protect the facts.

03:49:57.428 --> 03:50:06.317
I know a lot of the textbooks are saying that caste has ended, but the facts are that every day in India, three Dalits are murdered, two are raped, and three houses are burnt.

03:50:06.718 --> 03:50:17.869
And this morning, if we want to talk about caste oppression, the Hindu fundamentalists here called us casteist slurs outside, had a self-appointed usher who physically threatened us, multiple ushers physically threatened us.

03:50:18.229 --> 03:50:20.672
They called the state police and they had us kicked out of the building.

03:50:21.152 --> 03:50:28.273
I then provided medical care to a Dalit sister who had her first episode of epilepsy due to the harassment that she faced here this morning.

03:50:28.553 --> 03:50:29.834
She just testified here earlier.

03:50:30.214 --> 03:50:35.655
All of this to try and prevent us from testifying to the truth of the caste system.

03:50:36.795 --> 03:50:41.716
All of this to prevent us from testifying to the truth of the caste system that exists here and in India.

03:50:42.176 --> 03:50:46.196
Protect the frameworks and stop the system of ultimate facts.

03:50:46.296 --> 03:50:47.657
Don't let mob rule survive.

03:50:51.263 --> 03:50:52.364
Hi, my name is Kedar Reddy.

03:50:52.384 --> 03:50:55.045
I'm with the South Asian Histories for All Coalition.

03:50:55.265 --> 03:51:02.328
I'm a Hindu Californian, born into an upper caste family, and I believe that our textbooks shouldn't whitewash caste oppression.

03:51:02.928 --> 03:51:08.951
Its historical origins in Hinduism, the people it's impacted, it continues to impact, and the brave people who fight back.

03:51:10.057 --> 03:51:14.242
Uppercast Hindus keep complaining that reading about caste oppression makes them feel bad.

03:51:15.122 --> 03:51:16.304
You know what makes me feel bad?

03:51:17.305 --> 03:51:17.986
Caste denial.

03:51:19.167 --> 03:51:22.110
That's like families, white families saying, don't teach about slavery.

03:51:22.871 --> 03:51:23.692
It makes us feel bad.

03:51:24.352 --> 03:51:27.716
That's like straight people saying, don't teach about homophobia.

03:51:27.796 --> 03:51:28.557
It makes us feel bad.

03:51:30.706 --> 03:51:31.687
I'm saying this as a Hindu.

03:51:32.408 --> 03:51:34.390
Say no to textbooks that downplay casteism.

03:51:35.330 --> 03:51:39.294
There's no place for whitewashing or discrimination in California and not in our textbooks.

03:51:40.575 --> 03:51:43.979
Protect all Californians and not just complaining upper-caste Hindus.

03:51:45.220 --> 03:51:46.221
Enforce the frameworks.

03:51:46.981 --> 03:51:47.682
Fix the mistakes.

03:51:48.002 --> 03:51:48.523
Thank you so much.

03:51:53.584 --> 03:51:57.626
Hello, respected members of the State Board of Education.

03:51:57.786 --> 03:51:59.747
My name is Shravan Yampati.

03:52:00.828 --> 03:52:07.671
I made myself available today to voice my opinion on the denigration and representation of Hinduism in ancient India in school textbooks.

03:52:08.592 --> 03:52:11.834
Hinduism actually has a rich history of more than 5,000 years.

03:52:12.594 --> 03:52:16.336
Hinduism gave the world of yoga, Vedas, Ayurveda and many more things.

03:52:17.523 --> 03:52:24.588
I am shocked and deeply upset on how HMH and McGraw Hill programs stereotype and demonize Hindus and Hinduism.

03:52:25.569 --> 03:52:30.953
Their programs are outrightly biased, prejudiced, filled with hate against Hinduism.

03:52:31.293 --> 03:52:34.776
We want children of this great nation to learn facts, truth,

03:52:35.396 --> 03:52:38.799
mutual respect across among different religions and cultures.

03:52:39.439 --> 03:52:40.780
Stop demonizing Hinduism.

03:52:41.381 --> 03:52:42.702
Stop hatred against Hinduism.

03:52:43.342 --> 03:52:48.927
I fully support and stand with IQC's decision to reject the hateful books of HMH.

03:52:49.587 --> 03:52:54.511
I also support the recommendations by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other academicians.

03:52:54.971 --> 03:52:56.212
Please ask questions.

03:52:56.693 --> 03:52:56.913
Thank you.

03:53:01.983 --> 03:53:04.924
Good afternoon, dear members of the State Board of Education.

03:53:05.484 --> 03:53:06.384
My name is Rahul.

03:53:06.404 --> 03:53:07.264
I'm from Sunnyvale.

03:53:07.604 --> 03:53:11.605
I'm a proud parent of two children studying in the Cupertino School District.

03:53:12.305 --> 03:53:26.268
I'm here to thank and fully support IQC's decision to reject two programs from HMH, as I think core values of Hinduism are not represented correctly in those programs.

03:53:27.208 --> 03:53:30.329
I also support recommendations from Academic Coalition

03:53:30.942 --> 03:53:35.005
led by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other members.

03:53:36.866 --> 03:53:46.312
I request you to consider that young minds are like a clean slate, and we need to write the correct and bright side of any culture on it.

03:53:46.693 --> 03:53:46.973
Thank you.

03:53:52.895 --> 03:53:54.235
Hello to the members of SV.

03:53:54.956 --> 03:53:56.516
I'm Yogesh Bramey from San Ramon.

03:53:57.197 --> 03:54:01.078
I support the recommendations by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other academicians.

03:54:01.578 --> 03:54:02.939
Please consider them in full.

03:54:03.779 --> 03:54:10.601
I thank and fully support IQC for showing the courage to reject textbooks with hatred and prejudice towards Hindu religion.

03:54:11.162 --> 03:54:11.522
However,

03:54:12.262 --> 03:54:20.048
It shocked me to the core when I saw the stereotypical deception of Hinduism and ancient India is still present in the certain textbook drafts.

03:54:20.629 --> 03:54:23.171
Even their last month's submissions are not much useful.

03:54:23.851 --> 03:54:32.799
In spite of the presence of so many strong laws against racism, it pains my heart to see such bias and negative tone of narration in those textbook drafts.

03:54:33.539 --> 03:54:39.370
Deliberately ignoring the achievement of Indians and Hindus, it is showcased as if we have nothing to present to the world.

03:54:40.051 --> 03:54:44.499
As custodians of the fairness to the children, I urge the panel to reject these textbooks.

03:54:44.619 --> 03:54:44.880
Thank you.

03:54:50.359 --> 03:54:51.639
respected members of SBE.

03:54:52.019 --> 03:54:54.620
I'm Srinivas Badami from Dublin, California.

03:54:54.640 --> 03:54:55.380
I'm father of two.

03:54:56.040 --> 03:55:01.042
I missed my workday to make myself heard here because this information is very critical.

03:55:01.082 --> 03:55:03.142
My elder daughter is currently in sixth grade.

03:55:03.182 --> 03:55:08.283
She's reading the HMH book, and she has been questioning quite much content, even in the current textbook too.

03:55:10.304 --> 03:55:18.566
I hope the new books will have the correct information, and my younger daughter hopefully will get to read the correct history of ancient India.

03:55:19.264 --> 03:55:35.431
more disturbingly last year during framework process this group engaged in hindu phobic attacks on hindu american groups parents and even children they also tried to minimize and ridicule the very real experience of hindu american students who have been bullied in the classroom because of their religious identity

03:55:36.155 --> 03:55:53.591
This was apparent during the framework hearings last year when constituent members of SHFA belittled Hindu-American children in their testimony and made thumbs-down motions in the air while young Hindu-American students relayed their experiences of alienation and bullying to the members of IQC and SBE.

03:55:54.111 --> 03:55:54.352
Time.

03:56:01.158 --> 03:56:02.098
Good afternoon, members.

03:56:02.498 --> 03:56:04.079
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.

03:56:04.539 --> 03:56:10.140
I'm a physician and cardiologist in the community for several years.

03:56:10.720 --> 03:56:16.661
And I came out to this meeting and come out as a Dalit at 74 years of age.

03:56:17.301 --> 03:56:20.982
And the question is, does the caste system exist in the U.S.?

03:56:21.402 --> 03:56:26.463
I think the caste system exists in its full glory with the demonic oppression and suppressions.

03:56:27.283 --> 03:56:32.647
The reason I did not come out as a Dalit is because to escape this oppression and suppression.

03:56:33.007 --> 03:56:37.190
So believe it or not, it exists in its full glory in the U.S.

03:56:38.090 --> 03:56:47.977
And the reason I did not come out earlier is because I don't want my children to suffer from the same oppression and suppression which I went through in India as well as in this country.

03:56:50.245 --> 03:56:57.408
And because of all these reasons, I will request this board not to approve the textbook recommendation at this time.

03:56:57.748 --> 03:57:05.671
And I want the true facts to be established and change it to the actual facts rather than imaginary facts.

03:57:06.151 --> 03:57:07.192
And thank you for this time.

03:57:07.332 --> 03:57:07.752
Thank you, Jim.

03:57:14.448 --> 03:57:15.648
Namaste to all board members.

03:57:16.429 --> 03:57:20.371
I really appreciate the efforts of the IQC in identifying the inaccurate information.

03:57:21.172 --> 03:57:28.176
I think in this age of information, it is very important to get that we provide the right, accurate, appropriate information to our children and our educational institutions.

03:57:28.756 --> 03:57:38.282
So it is not fair to demonize one particular culture which has been teaching, encouraging the love, peaceful harmony, not only among the human beings, but all the creatures on this planet.

03:57:38.762 --> 03:57:40.944
So I request you to consider these points and thank you.

03:57:40.984 --> 03:57:41.204
Namaste.

03:57:47.734 --> 03:57:52.236
respected members of the State Board of Education, and my brothers and sisters.

03:57:53.177 --> 03:57:54.197
I am Makhan Keshav Goyal.

03:57:54.598 --> 03:57:56.339
I am from Milpitas City.

03:57:56.979 --> 03:58:00.881
My granddaughter is studying in John Shenote Elementary School, Milpitas.

03:58:01.581 --> 03:58:14.248
On the outset, I command the decision of IQC for rejecting Harcourt K-6 and 6-8 textbooks, which had the worst contents for our future generation.

03:58:14.848 --> 03:58:29.971
I recommend that you take a serious look at the other publishers who are not from Harcourt, like McGraw Hill and National Geography, and reject them as well as they are clearly missing the marks of following the framework.

03:58:30.751 --> 03:58:43.633
Our kids and the world at large need to learn to coexist and respect all as they are rather than pass judgment over one another causing stereotyping and bullying.

03:58:44.491 --> 03:58:55.787
Even after having strict law, I find it appealing that the named publishers push hate speech and derogatory contact only for Hinduism.

03:59:00.586 --> 03:59:05.611
Respected board members, I am Pranshu Wagh and I go to Horner Junior High.

03:59:06.272 --> 03:59:11.497
I am here to stand today against bullying of Hindu teens.

03:59:12.078 --> 03:59:18.844
The negative portrayal of Hinduism in the textbook causes one in three Hindu teens to be bullied.

03:59:19.765 --> 03:59:23.686
As a teenager, students like me try to find our identities.

03:59:24.326 --> 03:59:32.788
If students are being bullied for expressing their religion, they grow up feeling embarrassed about their belief and identity.

03:59:33.749 --> 03:59:39.050
We want to build a nation with confident citizens rather than ones with low self-esteem.

03:59:39.410 --> 03:59:47.052
So please, help teenagers like me by rejecting HMH's two programs as recommended by the IQC.

03:59:56.357 --> 03:59:58.417
respected members of state board education.

03:59:59.258 --> 04:00:00.778
I'm Venkat from Foster City.

04:00:01.738 --> 04:00:13.840
At a time of great division in our country and around the world, the importance of next generation is brought up to respecting each other's religion and maintaining a dignity is very critical.

04:00:14.600 --> 04:00:17.761
The sort of hatred is being pushed by fringe elements.

04:00:18.461 --> 04:00:22.302
Even in the textbook is clearly a hate speech, which has no place

04:00:23.082 --> 04:00:25.644
either in the textbook or anywhere in the civil world.

04:00:26.244 --> 04:00:34.669
It is not just against California Department of Education guidelines, but also against the spirit of our Constitution and against the spirit of education.

04:00:36.210 --> 04:00:42.913
The revisions that they are suggesting that have no academic backing and will lead to very serious social content violation.

04:00:43.674 --> 04:00:49.297
I stand here to support Jeffrey Long and 38 other academicians who are seeking historical accuracy.

04:00:50.080 --> 04:00:56.655
I request that recommendations by Jeffrey Long and the academic group be accepted to address all the problems in the books.

04:00:57.096 --> 04:00:57.396
Thank you.

04:01:01.394 --> 04:01:02.074
Good afternoon.

04:01:02.094 --> 04:01:03.935
I'm with the South Asian Histories for All.

04:01:04.035 --> 04:01:11.117
And the question before us is whether we value justice and how much we value justice.

04:01:11.717 --> 04:01:13.858
And what are we going to do about it?

04:01:14.798 --> 04:01:19.720
The caste apartheid that has brutalized the entire Dalit population

04:01:20.680 --> 04:01:22.261
for over 2600 years.

04:01:23.081 --> 04:01:25.622
Their lived reality cannot be erased.

04:01:26.162 --> 04:01:37.767
Last week, a young lady was sitting outside of a temple with her infant child and she was being pushed aside and she was bludgeoned to death.

04:01:39.696 --> 04:01:46.161
for making, bludgeoned to death with her infant child for making the area impure by the priest.

04:01:47.082 --> 04:01:55.408
Another young man dared to have a mustache and he was killed for simply that he had the audacity to have a mustache.

04:01:55.989 --> 04:02:01.073
Should we acknowledge the lived realities of the people or should we succumb to mob rule?

04:02:02.554 --> 04:02:03.835
This is the question for us.

04:02:12.574 --> 04:02:15.315
Good afternoon, respected members of State Board of Education.

04:02:15.916 --> 04:02:19.157
My name is Rahul Rajiv, and I'm a senior at Mountain House High School.

04:02:19.638 --> 04:02:24.780
Although it has been about six years since my world history experience, there are memories that still come to mind.

04:02:24.800 --> 04:02:34.846
I remember flipping over the last page of the chapter on ancient India and wondering, where was the information about yoga, Ayurvedic medicine, or all the scientific discoveries I heard about growing up?

04:02:35.606 --> 04:02:40.750
Instead, these were replaced by topics such as the caste system, which I remember reading about three whole pages about.

04:02:41.430 --> 04:02:52.258
This, along with other topics that have been emphasized in the textbooks, have led to several bullying incidents, one of which was a 12th grader being told to convert to Christianity in order to be more civilized.

04:02:52.998 --> 04:03:01.721
Having an incomplete, brief, and generalized unit, which only focuses on the negative aspects of Hinduism, does not help to dispel the persistent stereotypes.

04:03:02.621 --> 04:03:08.983
I have seen too many friends give up on their faith and hide their Hindu identity to avoid being socially isolated.

04:03:09.664 --> 04:03:13.925
As a senior in high school, I wish the best for generations of Hindus to come.

04:03:14.505 --> 04:03:14.645
Hello.

04:03:14.705 --> 04:03:21.388
Namaste to all.

04:03:23.129 --> 04:03:29.655
Respected members of the State Board of Education, I am Lalit Bansal, a grandfather from Pasadena, California.

04:03:30.395 --> 04:03:38.823
I find it very disturbing to see that today so much hatred against Hindus is being spread by some fringe

04:03:39.690 --> 04:03:43.591
Hindu phobia groups, like the South Asian historians for all.

04:03:43.951 --> 04:03:54.793
One of their leaders had put up a post on social media recently which refers to Hindu being blind followers of monkey or a half elephant thing, a reference to Hindu gods.

04:03:55.273 --> 04:04:04.035
They even ran a campaign to raise the statue of Indian civil rights leader Gandhi at different places, including Vernon Davis.

04:04:04.980 --> 04:04:10.161
They are even trying to erase Gandhi from the textbook, probably because he was a Hindu.

04:04:10.501 --> 04:04:15.682
It is a well-known fact that many prominent civil rights leaders like Martin Luther King Jr.

04:04:15.982 --> 04:04:22.544
were inspired by Gandhi, and such a request to remove him from the textbook shows a strong bias against Hindus.

04:04:23.164 --> 04:04:26.205
I earnestly require you to reject such hatred.

04:04:26.665 --> 04:04:27.125
Thank you.

04:04:31.368 --> 04:04:31.928
Good afternoon.

04:04:32.089 --> 04:04:33.390
My name is Sudeep Sabnis.

04:04:33.950 --> 04:04:37.633
I'm a resident of Campbell, San Jose with Campbell Union as our school district.

04:04:38.453 --> 04:04:51.704
I wish to state that inclusion of text like the Bhagavad Gita by translators outside the tradition as done with McGraw-Hill and Discovery is an adverse reflection of Hinduism.

04:04:52.424 --> 04:04:58.531
McGraw-Hill uses a translation by Edwin Arnold, page 280 of 6th grade text.

04:04:59.372 --> 04:05:04.057
He was a poet and a journalist, clearly not qualified for the task at hand.

04:05:04.478 --> 04:05:09.964
The excerpt should be replaced by one from Bhagavad Gita as it is by His Divine Grace A.C.

04:05:09.984 --> 04:05:11.706
Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada,

04:05:12.086 --> 04:05:22.491
which is the most widely published Bhagavad Gita in the world and has been translated into 50 plus languages used in universities like University of Chicago, Berkeley, Georgetown, et cetera.

04:05:22.951 --> 04:05:25.913
I endorse the recommendations by Professor Long and Hindupedia.

04:05:26.093 --> 04:05:26.433
Thank you.

04:05:32.096 --> 04:05:33.656
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

04:05:34.717 --> 04:05:36.438
My name is Dr. Gurbaksh Singh Baga.

04:05:37.418 --> 04:05:40.960
I'm here with the South Asian Histories for All.

04:05:41.994 --> 04:05:45.515
Just let me tell you, mob rules cannot erase the facts.

04:05:46.695 --> 04:05:49.976
Every single one of the textbooks hides caste oppression.

04:05:50.656 --> 04:05:52.017
There is not only one caste.

04:05:52.677 --> 04:05:55.798
There are 6,743 castes.

04:05:56.218 --> 04:05:57.898
Please Google it and find out.

04:05:58.779 --> 04:05:59.719
Here is an example.

04:06:00.319 --> 04:06:07.761
Discovery Education textbook says that Dalits were outcast because, and I quote, their jobs usually involved activities

04:06:08.487 --> 04:06:10.588
that were believed to be impure and unclean.

04:06:11.168 --> 04:06:12.408
This sentence is a lie.

04:06:12.968 --> 04:06:14.429
It is an alternative fact.

04:06:14.929 --> 04:06:21.251
Dalits were not discriminated against because of their occupation, but vice versa.

04:06:21.991 --> 04:06:32.474
Unclean occupation, like cleaning human waste by hand, were forced on them by discrimination and social control by Hindu Tawa, by Brahmanism.

04:06:32.874 --> 04:06:38.287
We ask that any material that says Dalit were mistreated because of their occupation.

04:06:38.467 --> 04:06:39.209
And thank you very much.

04:06:45.272 --> 04:06:46.733
Hello and good afternoon, everyone.

04:06:47.233 --> 04:06:53.118
My name is Anand Raite and I'm father of two daughters who are currently in Arvind Unified School District.

04:06:54.199 --> 04:07:10.412
I want my daughters to be proud of their origins and roots and the school board here can help them by including factual information, focusing on the positive aspects of Hindu religion, thereby protecting them from the bullying as well.

04:07:11.448 --> 04:07:17.671
I'm here to appeal you respectfully to consider the opinions of scholars like Professor Jeffrey Lang and others.

04:07:19.012 --> 04:07:26.356
I am here to support and appreciate ICQ decision to reject HMH 6 and 8.

04:07:27.357 --> 04:07:37.322
I earnestly request you to give due emphasis to one of the oldest civilization from Mohenjo-darota and Harappa and its currently evolving and contemporary nature.

04:07:37.842 --> 04:07:42.185
and also the currently involving inclusive philosophy.

04:07:43.366 --> 04:07:50.791
My fellow Hindus have presented here a few statistics here, but they are really focusing on a few negative aspects.

04:07:51.572 --> 04:07:58.556
Are these really representative and are these really the ground level experiences of everyday people?

04:07:59.117 --> 04:08:00.798
And the answer is definitely no.

04:08:02.356 --> 04:08:07.199
I hope the school board will see through all this and reject this distorted picture.

04:08:07.819 --> 04:08:15.424
Most important, help my daughters and thousands like them to have a respectful life with due pride.

04:08:15.584 --> 04:08:15.884
Thank you.

04:08:21.522 --> 04:08:25.445
Dear members of State Board of Education, thanks for a chance to speak today.

04:08:26.446 --> 04:08:31.490
I am Mangesh Phadke, parent of two children studying in 6th and the 10th grade in Cupertino School District.

04:08:32.371 --> 04:08:43.661
I'm here to express my absolute shock and outrage about the content being taught to my kids about one of the oldest and greatest civilization, as well as religion of the world, that is India and Hindu religion correspondingly.

04:08:44.561 --> 04:08:51.403
In this context, I support the recommendations by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other accommodations in this matter.

04:08:52.384 --> 04:08:55.204
I stand here to oppose hatred against Hindus and Indians.

04:08:56.265 --> 04:09:08.428
Hindu religion was presented to USA and rest of the world by a Hindu monk, namely Swami Vivekananda, at the Parliament of World's Religion on 11th September, 1893 in Chicago.

04:09:09.069 --> 04:09:12.870
It was held by the entire world, including USA, as a religion of peace and brotherhood.

04:09:13.550 --> 04:09:19.636
California education books, especially by HMH, does not reflect any of those core concepts.

04:09:20.397 --> 04:09:24.381
I fully support the decision of IQC to reject two programs of HMH.

04:09:24.921 --> 04:09:29.245
These programs are bluntly racist, hinduphobic, homophobic, and worse in quality.

04:09:29.666 --> 04:09:29.926
Thank you.

04:09:33.103 --> 04:09:35.064
Good afternoon, dear members of SBE.

04:09:35.384 --> 04:09:37.345
My name is Sachin and I come from Fremont.

04:09:38.026 --> 04:09:42.328
I'm a resident of California for the last 17 years and a proud parent of two girls.

04:09:43.329 --> 04:09:54.115
I feel blessed to raise my kids in such a culturally diverse state, but I am dismayed in horror when I read what HMH textbooks have to say about India and Hindu civilization.

04:09:55.055 --> 04:10:03.840
It shows images of cows eating trash, human labor and monkeys working together, scary-looking, gaudy images of Indian gods.

04:10:04.860 --> 04:10:09.563
All these images and text represent a poor, dirty, and primitive picture of India.

04:10:11.084 --> 04:10:12.765
You should really take a look at these images.

04:10:12.805 --> 04:10:15.366
You don't need to be a Hindu to feel the horror that I feel.

04:10:16.693 --> 04:10:18.894
Remember, a picture is worth a thousand words.

04:10:19.154 --> 04:10:22.937
And these are the images my kids are going to be reading about.

04:10:23.377 --> 04:10:27.539
So I'm really worried about raising my kids in California if these textbooks aren't changed.

04:10:28.200 --> 04:10:36.104
Hence, I fully support IQC's recommendations to fully reject HMH K-8 textbooks and also support Dr. Jeffrey Long's recommendations.

04:10:36.345 --> 04:10:37.025
Thank you for your time.

04:10:40.071 --> 04:10:43.552
Dear respected board members, my name is Ankit and I come from San Jose.

04:10:43.993 --> 04:10:46.934
I'm here to support recommendation of South Asian histories for all.

04:10:47.594 --> 04:10:59.879
I am a Buddhist and I come from a Dalit family and I want to quote National Geographic's textbook, quote, the Buddha taught a person of any caste could attain nirvana, which is the ultimate peace, end quote.

04:11:00.820 --> 04:11:05.465
I ask to please remove the attempts of the Hindu lobby to Hinduize the Buddha.

04:11:06.066 --> 04:11:11.572
Americans may not be aware, but these are the strategies of the right wing to raise the resistance of the Buddha to the caste.

04:11:12.373 --> 04:11:21.423
Buddhism resists caste, that is why many people converted to Buddhism, like Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, who is the father of modern India and who wrote the constitution.

04:11:22.123 --> 04:11:25.147
I want to close by a three statement.

04:11:25.628 --> 04:11:27.830
Please enforce framework and fix the mistakes.

04:11:28.471 --> 04:11:29.812
Stop the alternative facts.

04:11:30.133 --> 04:11:32.476
And last, mob cannot erase the facts.

04:11:32.816 --> 04:11:33.136
Thank you.

04:11:33.297 --> 04:11:33.557
Jai Been.

04:11:38.106 --> 04:11:39.407
Hello, respected board members.

04:11:40.088 --> 04:11:41.569
My name is Thiba Soundarajan.

04:11:42.130 --> 04:11:44.552
I am a software engineer that works in San Francisco.

04:11:45.073 --> 04:11:46.334
I'm also a Dalit American.

04:11:47.575 --> 04:11:53.361
This morning, I was pushed at, yelled at, and harassed by Hindu fundamentalists while waiting to testify.

04:11:55.002 --> 04:11:58.726
I also had to take care of my two sisters who fell ill because of this harassment.

04:11:59.506 --> 04:12:10.475
However, me, as a result of this California public school system, I'm still here to tell you today that caste-based oppression does not create social stability.

04:12:11.656 --> 04:12:15.840
The phrase that the caste system creates social stability is a lie.

04:12:16.520 --> 04:12:28.831
We see that, and our communities, especially Dalit communities who have faced violence against the hands of Hindu fundamentalists, and what happened this morning can clearly demonstrate that.

04:12:30.160 --> 04:12:33.041
I support the recommendations from South Asian Histories for All.

04:12:33.901 --> 04:12:40.262
Please enforce the frameworks, fix the mistakes, and please remember that mob rule cannot erase facts.

04:12:41.462 --> 04:12:49.244
So before the next speaker, I just want to remind everybody that we need to respect all speakers here, and we do not want any outbursts.

04:12:49.404 --> 04:12:51.165
Every speaker deserves the same respect.

04:12:51.185 --> 04:12:55.906
So I'll ask everyone in the audience to please give the respect that you expect when you talk as well.

04:12:56.126 --> 04:12:56.446
Thank you.

04:12:56.866 --> 04:12:57.366
Go ahead, ma'am.

04:13:00.376 --> 04:13:02.617
Namaste, honorable members of the board.

04:13:03.638 --> 04:13:07.580
I'm a proud mother of an elementary school student in Fremont Unified School District.

04:13:08.180 --> 04:13:14.504
I read the HMH textbook and was outraged with the information they sent about Hindu religion.

04:13:14.964 --> 04:13:21.348
I found inaccurate and unfavorable comparisons of Hinduism with other religions and generally a negative approach towards Hinduism.

04:13:21.788 --> 04:13:26.091
I fully support IQC's decision to reject the textbooks of HMH for K-8

04:13:27.251 --> 04:13:33.018
And I support the recommendation of the academic coalitions by Professor Jeffrey Long and his team.

04:13:33.479 --> 04:13:39.707
Textbooks need to be giving education accurate information and not create any confusion or wrong impression in their tender minds.

04:13:40.127 --> 04:13:40.407
Thank you.

04:13:44.838 --> 04:13:45.358
Namaste.

04:13:46.199 --> 04:13:47.800
My name is Jay Singh.

04:13:48.881 --> 04:13:55.386
I'm a father of two primary school children and live in Santa Clara.

04:13:55.546 --> 04:13:56.647
That's where they go to school.

04:13:57.487 --> 04:14:02.431
I've lived in various parts of India, 30 years, different parts, different states.

04:14:04.813 --> 04:14:07.395
Came close to different religions and quite a bit.

04:14:07.975 --> 04:14:09.756
And coming from a scholarly family,

04:14:10.777 --> 04:14:17.160
When we talk about Indian civilization, ancient Indian history, Hinduism, these subjects are very near and dear to the family.

04:14:17.720 --> 04:14:18.741
So this is part of life.

04:14:18.761 --> 04:14:20.242
This is where I'm coming from.

04:14:21.422 --> 04:14:28.646
When I looked at an HMS draft which someone forwarded very recently to me, I was a bit shocked.

04:14:28.966 --> 04:14:31.607
I was looking at this vague information.

04:14:32.708 --> 04:14:36.670
I was looking at misrepresentation of ancient India and

04:14:38.197 --> 04:14:41.300
a lot of negative connotation when we talk about Hinduism.

04:14:43.101 --> 04:14:50.107
Hinduism, which is a synonym for humanity in all fairness.

04:14:50.708 --> 04:14:51.248
Thank you, sir.

04:14:52.670 --> 04:14:53.590
Thank you very, very much.

04:14:53.610 --> 04:14:54.251
Thank you.

04:14:54.711 --> 04:14:55.412
Next speaker, please.

04:14:56.837 --> 04:15:00.498
Good afternoon, my name is Deen Mori Sandarajan and I am a Dalit American.

04:15:01.018 --> 04:15:04.359
I'm here to say that mob rule does not get to determine a fact.

04:15:04.939 --> 04:15:23.825
The fact that today we had the cops called on us, we had men harass us, my mother was crying, my staff member had an epileptic seizure because of the tension and the lack of protection for caste-oppressed minorities to speak with parity to access this process shows that democracy is being hijacked.

04:15:24.245 --> 04:15:31.167
We are seeing what happens in Charlottesville when white supremacists roam the streets and try to rewrite the history of slavery.

04:15:31.527 --> 04:15:36.928
What we are seeing in California is Hindu fundamentalists trying to rewrite the facts about caste.

04:15:37.349 --> 04:15:46.171
That goes against all of the evidence that we've submitted, both from the South Asia Faculty Group, from the UN, from major civil institutions in both India and the United States.

04:15:46.591 --> 04:15:50.016
I should not have to brave violence to be able to speak my testimony.

04:15:50.496 --> 04:15:54.361
I should not have to have my family and my community members be crying.

04:15:54.702 --> 04:16:04.234
I have been attempted to be ejected from this building four times today by people that reported me to the Board of Education simply for carrying the dangerous history of my people.

04:16:04.674 --> 04:16:11.378
This is the dangerousness of my people, the fact that my people are cleaning up shit still under the caste system.

04:16:11.659 --> 04:16:17.783
But that also is the reason why history matters, facts matters, and you cannot shut it down.

04:16:26.346 --> 04:16:26.927
Good afternoon.

04:16:27.468 --> 04:16:28.589
My name is Preeti Shekhar.

04:16:28.990 --> 04:16:32.254
I'm a journalist and a radio producer and a human rights activist from India.

04:16:33.555 --> 04:16:37.680
I'm a practicing Hindu, upper caste Hindu woman, but I want to learn about caste.

04:16:37.941 --> 04:16:42.466
I want to learn about how different people have struggled to name and fight their subjugation.

04:16:43.387 --> 04:16:51.413
Just like how white kids learn about racism and slavery in this country, people like us and our kids need to learn about the history of caste oppression.

04:16:52.114 --> 04:16:59.979
I want to learn from Dalits how I can work with them and others towards real social justice and restitution for caste violence.

04:17:00.260 --> 04:17:10.867
But I see that possibility made smaller by California textbooks that erase the word Dalit, like the National Geographic one, or texts that connect caste with stability, like Pearson's.

04:17:12.188 --> 04:17:19.590
Please equip students our future generations with the ability to see describe and combat discrimination not deny it.

04:17:20.391 --> 04:17:23.612
We request the board to please enforce the framework and to fix the mistakes.

04:17:23.972 --> 04:17:24.292
Thank you.

04:17:30.874 --> 04:17:31.254
Respect.

04:17:32.474 --> 04:17:34.635
Respected members of State Board of Education.

04:17:35.120 --> 04:17:37.903
My name is Soham Kanhekar, and I'm studying in eighth grade.

04:17:38.703 --> 04:17:42.066
Many Indian kids have been ridiculed and made fun of because of these textbooks.

04:17:42.847 --> 04:17:49.433
Every one out of three Hindu American kids has reported that they have been bullied on religious beliefs and practices.

04:17:49.874 --> 04:17:55.078
Many children have said this has happened after the sections on Hinduism in ancient India were taught in schools.

04:17:55.419 --> 04:17:59.763
Hence, it is extremely important that the hatred and the bias in the textbooks be addressed immediately.

04:18:00.343 --> 04:18:06.488
I stand here with the Hindu American children who have been bullied and have faced hatred in the classroom like me.

04:18:07.169 --> 04:18:12.553
I have missed my own history test to support kids like my own brother who would learn through these future textbooks.

04:18:13.274 --> 04:18:16.877
I fully support the decision of IQC to reject the two programs of HMH.

04:18:18.138 --> 04:18:22.085
I request SBE to say no against hatred against Hindus in all forms.

04:18:22.466 --> 04:18:29.177
I support the recommendations of academic coalition by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other top academics.

04:18:29.758 --> 04:18:31.341
Please take all their recommendations.

04:18:31.681 --> 04:18:31.942
Thank you.

04:18:36.496 --> 04:18:38.197
Good afternoon to all the members present here.

04:18:38.497 --> 04:18:39.618
My name is Krish Jaigar.

04:18:40.018 --> 04:18:43.640
I'm an immigrant from India, and I'm here with the South Asian History for All.

04:18:44.300 --> 04:18:50.764
We have seen textbooks from companies like Pearson, National Geographic, and they all bear the mark of the Hindu nationalist groups.

04:18:52.024 --> 04:18:54.465
How can each of the publishers make the same kind of mistakes?

04:18:55.125 --> 04:18:58.805
On behalf of the Indian-American community, we ask you to do three things.

04:18:59.566 --> 04:19:02.526
First, delay the process so you can do a review.

04:19:02.986 --> 04:19:04.767
Second, fix all the mistakes.

04:19:05.147 --> 04:19:06.227
Look at our recommendations.

04:19:06.967 --> 04:19:11.548
They were endorsed by over 100 scholars of South Asia from Title VI US universities.

04:19:12.288 --> 04:19:14.729
And third, send the textbooks back to the IQC.

04:19:15.149 --> 04:19:16.229
Let them make the final edits.

04:19:16.849 --> 04:19:22.433
The Hindu nationalist groups claim to represent all Indians, but their lobbyists don't represent us.

04:19:23.073 --> 04:19:26.295
The real Indian-American community is on your side.

04:19:26.656 --> 04:19:26.936
Thank you.

04:19:33.010 --> 04:19:36.892
Dear members of the State Board of Education, my name is Praneeta Grewal.

04:19:37.212 --> 04:19:39.853
I'm a 7th grader in Iron Horse Middle School, San Ramon.

04:19:40.253 --> 04:19:45.375
I'm here today because I'm a Hindu and I want all my friends to learn correct information about my religion.

04:19:45.915 --> 04:19:47.616
But unfortunately, that is not happening.

04:19:48.476 --> 04:19:51.537
For example, McGraw-Hill textbook has some problems.

04:19:52.117 --> 04:19:56.718
The textbook originally inaccurately said that Ashoka became Buddhist after the war.

04:19:57.178 --> 04:20:00.739
But in fact, he embraced Buddhism three years before the actual war.

04:20:01.480 --> 04:20:05.921
IQC made a correction in only one place in the last hearing after it was pointed out.

04:20:06.621 --> 04:20:09.342
But in two places, the error still exists.

04:20:10.082 --> 04:20:16.604
I request that the recommendations by Jeffrey Long and the academic group be accepted to address all the problems in McGraw-Hill.

04:20:16.824 --> 04:20:17.104
Thank you.

04:20:21.761 --> 04:20:22.923
Good afternoon, everyone.

04:20:22.943 --> 04:20:25.646
I'm Gurmeet and I'm from Fremont.

04:20:26.107 --> 04:20:35.940
My son is in sixth grade and more than me, he's more worried about the discrimination and bullying in the class because after some time they're going to read the same text.

04:20:36.881 --> 04:20:47.632
On page 177 of sixth grade textbook of HMH 6 to 8 programs called Vedas, the sacred Hindu scriptures, a collection of spells and charms.

04:20:48.092 --> 04:20:49.053
Spells and charms?

04:20:49.473 --> 04:20:53.738
No other sacred book is mentioned in such denigrating terms.

04:20:54.098 --> 04:20:57.021
This is inaccurate, biased, and discriminatory.

04:20:57.521 --> 04:21:01.145
I support the letter by Geoffrey Long and 38 other academicists.

04:21:01.705 --> 04:21:07.489
Hence, I ask you to reject HMH-II programs as recommended by IQC.

04:21:07.869 --> 04:21:08.309
Thank you.

04:21:13.973 --> 04:21:17.955
Respected member of the Education Board, I'm Praveen Agarwal from St.

04:21:17.995 --> 04:21:22.458
Ramon, and my daughter just spoke to you about how deeply distressed she is.

04:21:23.675 --> 04:21:33.379
I'm here supporting the recommendations by Professor Jeffrey Long and all other accommodations and request our honorable panel to please consider the suggestions.

04:21:34.119 --> 04:21:44.623
I also thankfully support IQC for rejecting such textbooks which spread negativity towards any religion and creating an environment of racism and division in the schools.

04:21:46.023 --> 04:21:52.746
It is really sad to see the depiction of Hinduism and ancient India being represented in the textbook in such a negative fashion.

04:21:54.125 --> 04:22:04.492
even when the country and the same religion has given the leaders like Gandhi, a guru like Buddha and Guru Nanak, and a practice like meditation and yoga to the world.

04:22:05.192 --> 04:22:07.234
And not only that in the ancient history.

04:22:07.574 --> 04:22:12.557
In the modern history, nine out of 10 CEOs of the top tech companies are Indians.

04:22:14.038 --> 04:22:20.582
So the country, which has embraced different religions, ethnicity, and culturalism, has to be depicted in the correct fashion.

04:22:21.383 --> 04:22:21.623
Thank you.

04:22:27.139 --> 04:22:27.719
Good afternoon.

04:22:28.200 --> 04:22:29.721
My name is Manoj Kumar Ekarwal.

04:22:29.881 --> 04:22:31.442
I am from San Ramon, California.

04:22:31.462 --> 04:22:33.243
I am father of two kids.

04:22:34.224 --> 04:22:39.687
I am here to oppose hatred against Hindus and Indians in California textbooks.

04:22:40.908 --> 04:22:46.972
I thank and fully support the decision of IQC to reject the two programs of HMH.

04:22:47.913 --> 04:22:49.734
These programs are the worst of all.

04:22:50.294 --> 04:23:01.189
even after the huge number of revisions and rewrites submitted at the last minute, which correctively do not even address all the problems.

04:23:02.631 --> 04:23:06.015
HMS had to submit thousands of pages of revisions

04:23:06.996 --> 04:23:11.377
Let us be clear, even then the problems are not getting solved.

04:23:12.278 --> 04:23:19.039
The height is, even with their submitted edits, you can find several errors at a quick glance.

04:23:20.160 --> 04:23:34.964
Just for example, K-2-6 teacher edition, page 469, the reason says Martin King Luther, Jr., instead of Dr. Martin Luther King.

04:23:35.204 --> 04:23:35.644
Thank you, sir.

04:23:36.168 --> 04:23:36.419
Thank you.

04:23:41.105 --> 04:23:44.046
Respected members of state education, my name is Jaydeep Dey.

04:23:44.066 --> 04:23:45.387
I'm from Dublin, California.

04:23:45.407 --> 04:23:48.188
I have a fourth grader and a kindergartner.

04:23:48.508 --> 04:23:55.531
And as a parent, I'm really worried about the contents that my kids are going to study in the sixth grade, which is filled with hate against the Hindus.

04:23:56.111 --> 04:24:00.013
I fully support the decision of IQC to reject the two programs of HMH.

04:24:00.653 --> 04:24:06.736
While some of the textbooks programs are good, the HMH programs are racist, Hinduphobic, and worst in quality.

04:24:07.636 --> 04:24:17.039
They have numerous violations of Category 1 of adoption guidelines, especially the Category 1.10, which prohibits adverse reflection based on religion and ethnicity.

04:24:17.540 --> 04:24:21.841
They also violate the California law, which prohibits religious discrimination.

04:24:22.601 --> 04:24:29.344
In the name of religion, we are seeing enough hatred in today's world, and we don't want to add more to it by spreading lies and hatred against Hindus.

04:24:30.164 --> 04:24:35.366
I request the board members to reject HMH2 programs as recommended by IQC.

04:24:35.826 --> 04:24:36.106
Thank you.

04:24:41.016 --> 04:24:43.358
Respected of the Board of Education, Namaste.

04:24:43.678 --> 04:24:48.122
This is Vikas Prashad from Sanderman, proud father of a seven-year-old first grader.

04:24:49.242 --> 04:24:55.447
I'm here to support the recommendations from Professor Jeffrey Long and his 38 scholars.

04:24:56.168 --> 04:24:57.529
Please consider them in full.

04:24:58.449 --> 04:25:09.218
I also like to thank and fully support IQC's decision and showing the courage to reject the textbooks showing prejudice and hatred towards Hindu religion.

04:25:09.978 --> 04:25:21.740
However, it shocked me to the core when I saw the stereotypical depiction of not only Hinduism, but also in ancient India and some of these textbook drafts.

04:25:22.141 --> 04:25:24.881
Even the last month's submissions are not much useful.

04:25:26.161 --> 04:25:38.784
In spite of so many strong laws against racism in US, it pains my heart to see that biased and negative tone of narration in those textbook tests.

04:25:40.345 --> 04:25:44.169
And it looks like they are deliberately... Thank you.

04:25:45.170 --> 04:25:45.770
Thank you very much.

04:25:50.434 --> 04:25:53.037
Respected members, I am Anil Rahom.

04:25:53.357 --> 04:25:56.520
I am from San Ramon and I am father of two kids.

04:25:56.961 --> 04:26:01.284
My kids go to middle school and elementary school in San Ramon.

04:26:02.125 --> 04:26:05.989
My daughter's social studies classroom experience was different from the truth.

04:26:08.266 --> 04:26:12.488
I have been hoping for better books for my son, so I decided to come here and talk in front of you.

04:26:13.328 --> 04:26:23.252
I fully support the recommendation of IQC to reject the textbook of HMH, but I would like you, the respected board members, to do more to fix the problem.

04:26:24.072 --> 04:26:29.254
McGraw-Hill also has a lot of racist contents, which is the violation of education codes.

04:26:30.715 --> 04:26:39.566
I also support that all the recommendations of the Academic Coalition of Professor Jeffrey Long and his 38 top academics should be accepted.

04:26:40.727 --> 04:26:45.252
If the publisher does not accept these corrections, please reject the textbook of these publications.

04:26:45.533 --> 04:26:45.793
Thank you.

04:26:51.707 --> 04:26:53.969
respected member of the State Board of Education.

04:26:54.350 --> 04:27:02.158
My name is Anand, and I'm a father of an 11th grader and a third grader in Saindraman.

04:27:02.278 --> 04:27:10.546
I stand here to fully support the IQC for sharing the courage to reject hatred and prejudice for rejecting the HMH book.

04:27:11.427 --> 04:27:24.771
Also, I request SBE also to all harmful content, some of which is in the other books and some of it is being pushed by the Hinduphobic groups in the last movement.

04:27:25.391 --> 04:27:29.732
I request SBC to say no to hatred against the Hindus in all forms.

04:27:30.192 --> 04:27:32.093
Textbook is not the place for the politics.

04:27:32.413 --> 04:27:33.753
It's not the place for the hatred.

04:27:34.413 --> 04:27:36.634
Hence, please reject all forms of hatred today.

04:27:37.395 --> 04:27:42.566
I support the recommendation of Professor Jeffrey Long and other recommendation.

04:27:42.766 --> 04:27:43.528
Please consider them.

04:27:44.129 --> 04:27:44.450
Thank you.

04:27:48.933 --> 04:27:50.955
Hello, my name is Gulshan Bhatia.

04:27:50.975 --> 04:27:51.916
I'm from Laguna Hills.

04:27:52.596 --> 04:28:02.186
I didn't go to high school or middle school here, but my children did, and I remember the pain they went through, and hence what we felt about their pain.

04:28:04.848 --> 04:28:14.057
Through a country of 1.3 billion people, there are spread cases of casteism, but it is saying that a new scientific phenomena

04:28:15.356 --> 04:28:40.602
or new social awareness does not get prevalent simply by convincing or eliminating his opponent, but rather a new generation is born which is familiar with the idea and those who are opposed to it eventually die, not killed, die, and the new idea becomes accepted and gets in practice.

04:28:42.463 --> 04:28:45.026
So all the laws are against casteism.

04:28:45.987 --> 04:28:49.431
The people from that category are given preferences.

04:28:49.551 --> 04:28:52.334
Even the president of India today is president from that caste.

04:28:53.255 --> 04:28:53.956
Thank you very much.

04:28:58.737 --> 04:29:01.999
Namaste, dear Board of Education.

04:29:02.159 --> 04:29:06.202
My name is Jay Prakash from Santa Clara, California, having a son of fifth grade.

04:29:07.163 --> 04:29:14.547
I'm shocked to see dark contrast, the content my son is going to study and what was taught at my home.

04:29:15.448 --> 04:29:22.853
With deep concerns, I stand here to oppose the silent hate propaganda against the great Indian civilization.

04:29:23.433 --> 04:29:25.554
Okay, so my ask is simple and clear.

04:29:26.115 --> 04:29:34.020
So please support Professor Jeffrey Long's recommendations for the K-6 to K-8 textbooks.

04:29:34.360 --> 04:29:34.680
Thank you.

04:29:38.803 --> 04:29:40.404
Hello, my name is Dave Goyal.

04:29:40.604 --> 04:29:46.628
I'm from Orange County, city of Irvine, one of the best school districts in our neighborhood.

04:29:47.128 --> 04:29:49.630
I moved there because I want to give a good education to my children.

04:29:50.370 --> 04:29:54.914
And one day my daughter come home and she start talking about all the Hinduism questions.

04:29:55.375 --> 04:29:56.756
And I was surprised where she's getting from.

04:29:56.776 --> 04:30:00.700
And I could tell she have a shame in her eyes when she was talking about it.

04:30:00.720 --> 04:30:04.103
So I asked her to let me read the books.

04:30:04.183 --> 04:30:06.025
So I read the books and I was surprised.

04:30:06.565 --> 04:30:07.526
This is California.

04:30:08.026 --> 04:30:12.490
People over here come from all over the world, all religious, everybody get respected.

04:30:12.971 --> 04:30:14.612
How the textbook can be so biased?

04:30:16.154 --> 04:30:19.979
Not going furthermore, I will just urge you guys, please fix these issues forever.

04:30:20.679 --> 04:30:22.942
And as for President, let's make California great again.

04:30:23.383 --> 04:30:23.663
Thank you.

04:30:26.767 --> 04:30:31.712
Respected board members, I'm Sushil Sood from Arcadia, California.

04:30:33.798 --> 04:30:41.404
I came here, my kids are already grown out of college, they are in college, but I came here to take this opportunity to talk about what they went through when they were in school.

04:30:42.384 --> 04:30:54.995
And they were bullied, but me and my wife, who is a high school teacher in Glendale Unified in California itself, we tried to work with them and make them understand what the true religion is, how they should face those discriminations they were having in school.

04:30:55.595 --> 04:30:57.476
It was hard and very difficult.

04:30:57.836 --> 04:31:16.404
Now they've grown out, but I want to take this opportunity to request you guys to take into consideration recommendations by Professor Jeffrey Lang and make those amendments in the textbook so the future generation who is coming should not be facing that kind of discrimination and should live with their head high with dignity.

04:31:16.884 --> 04:31:17.144
Thank you.

04:31:28.424 --> 04:31:30.525
Namaste, my name is Samriddhi Pathak.

04:31:30.646 --> 04:31:33.688
I am a fifth grader from Laneview Elementary School, San Jose.

04:31:34.208 --> 04:31:47.237
Recently, I overheard my parents talking about incorrect, misleading, and biased content in the new draft of CA textbook publishers about India, Indian culture, and Hinduism.

04:31:48.351 --> 04:31:59.560
Several of my middle school friends shared their horrific and discouraging bullying experiences due to this racist biased text in CA textbooks.

04:32:00.601 --> 04:32:08.588
I am deeply concerned afraid that I am going to face the same bullying experiences as I am a Hindu Indian origin kid.

04:32:08.908 --> 04:32:15.233
I am sure you can stop this by happening by rejecting such type of textbook publishers.

04:32:15.714 --> 04:32:16.074
Thank you.

04:32:27.259 --> 04:32:29.060
Good afternoon, respected board members.

04:32:29.621 --> 04:32:30.822
I am Prashant from Pleasanton.

04:32:32.063 --> 04:32:35.525
I stand here to oppose hatred against Hindus and Indians.

04:32:36.746 --> 04:32:40.909
I thank and fully support the decision of IQC to reject the two programs of HMH.

04:32:41.570 --> 04:32:47.695
HMH's hundreds of revisions are incomplete, as they promised to replace some content.

04:32:48.155 --> 04:32:50.537
They have not even said what those replacement would be.

04:32:51.458 --> 04:32:55.881
How could a draft textbook be adopted when it is not even complete?

04:32:57.304 --> 04:32:57.964
Who reviews them?

04:32:58.565 --> 04:33:02.126
Can you adopt drafts or textbooks based on promises made by publishers?

04:33:02.807 --> 04:33:06.829
This is completely volatile on the basis of adoption.

04:33:07.529 --> 04:33:11.111
Hence, I ask you to reject HMS2 program as recommended by Equis.

04:33:11.631 --> 04:33:11.871
Thank you.

04:33:18.706 --> 04:33:25.268
Respected members of the State Board of Education, I am Raju Chamarti, Chief Academic Officer at the University of Silicon Andhra.

04:33:26.469 --> 04:33:34.872
I also manage a non-profit initiative teaching a South Indian language to more than 9,000 students in 200 cities across 35 states in the U.S.

04:33:35.712 --> 04:33:37.713
with the help of 1,500 passionate volunteers.

04:33:39.213 --> 04:33:41.214
McGraw-Hill book has several inaccuracies.

04:33:42.194 --> 04:33:46.356
IQC made corrections in some places, but several errors still exist.

04:33:48.214 --> 04:33:52.356
I support the recommendations by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other recommendations.

04:33:53.717 --> 04:34:01.881
Respected members, this is history, not a Hollywood story, and the history should not be distorted or misrepresented.

04:34:03.121 --> 04:34:07.623
It is the responsibility of the board to provide the facts and not the fiction in the history books.

04:34:08.784 --> 04:34:10.005
Please help correct the problem.

04:34:10.465 --> 04:34:10.765
Thank you.

04:34:19.215 --> 04:34:23.381
Respected Member of State Board of Education, I am Mandar Joshi from San Ramon.

04:34:24.001 --> 04:34:27.246
I stand here to oppose hatred against Hindus and Indians.

04:34:27.746 --> 04:34:33.654
IQC has shown courage to reject hatred and prejudice by rejecting two Hinduphobic books.

04:34:34.235 --> 04:34:44.060
We request SBE also to reject all hateful content, some of which is in other books and some of which is binged by Hinduphobic group at this last moment.

04:34:44.700 --> 04:34:49.522
I request SBE to say no to hatred against Hindus in all forms.

04:34:50.122 --> 04:34:52.443
Textbook is not the place for hatred.

04:34:52.844 --> 04:34:54.284
It is not the place for politics.

04:34:54.584 --> 04:34:57.366
Hence, please reject all forms of hate today.

04:34:58.287 --> 04:35:03.117
I support the recommendations by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other scholars.

04:35:03.458 --> 04:35:06.104
Please consider them all in full.

04:35:06.405 --> 04:35:06.746
Thank you.

04:35:10.735 --> 04:35:13.719
Board members, thank you for this opportunity to speak in front of you.

04:35:14.299 --> 04:35:15.180
My name is Ajay Goel.

04:35:15.200 --> 04:35:20.886
I'm a resident of Folsom with children going to Folsom Cordova School District and a practitioner of Hinduism.

04:35:21.567 --> 04:35:25.671
First of all, thank you for including information about Hindu text in the books.

04:35:26.512 --> 04:35:27.874
I have a very humble request.

04:35:28.554 --> 04:35:33.259
Many of the details that are contained in the books have been translated by

04:35:34.060 --> 04:35:36.503
by people who are not practitioners of Hinduism.

04:35:37.664 --> 04:35:50.738
As per the Vedic texts, it says that one who is following these Vedic texts, one who is a devotee of the Lord can understand, can develop understanding of the message given in those books.

04:35:51.418 --> 04:36:00.606
So our request is if you could kindly include text by the translations from the from Acharyas, from teachers who are practitioners of those books.

04:36:01.026 --> 04:36:08.192
Especially the one I personally follow is Bhagavad Gita as it is spoken and written by His Divine Grace A.C.

04:36:08.232 --> 04:36:09.653
Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.

04:36:10.134 --> 04:36:13.477
He is the founder Acharya of International Society for Krishna Consciousness.

04:36:14.337 --> 04:36:14.658
Thank you.

04:36:14.998 --> 04:36:16.359
Thank you very much for the opportunity.

04:36:21.584 --> 04:36:25.826
Respected SBE members, I'm a proud Hindu parent of two young kids.

04:36:26.586 --> 04:36:27.586
I live in San Ramon.

04:36:28.147 --> 04:36:35.189
I completely support the IQC decision to reject head-filled textbooks, which are HMH K-6 and 6-8.

04:36:35.330 --> 04:36:44.633
I completely agree IQC says that the program does not meet all the evaluation criteria in Category 1, specifically criteria statements 1.3 and 1.4.

04:36:46.934 --> 04:36:50.576
which talks about religious discrimination and adverse reflection.

04:36:50.676 --> 04:36:54.718
The program has numerous errors that exceed the definition of minimal in number.

04:36:54.879 --> 04:37:01.042
The program also includes depiction of individuals from various religious groups that constitute adverse reflections.

04:37:01.882 --> 04:37:09.089
as defined in state standards evaluating instructional material for social content and are not consistent with the criteria statements 1.10.

04:37:10.250 --> 04:37:16.435
And that correcting these issues would require rewrites to the whole program which are not permitted as per CCR section 9524A5.

04:37:18.317 --> 04:37:24.827
It is highly critical that we provide fact-based, unbiased information to our young generations to develop a healthy atmosphere.

04:37:24.948 --> 04:37:33.421
Hence, I request you to please reject the other two textbooks, McGraw-Hill and Discovery, that are still biased and misrepresented.

04:37:37.593 --> 04:37:37.873
Let's see.

04:37:37.893 --> 04:37:38.114
Hi.

04:37:38.194 --> 04:37:39.154
It's so good to see you all.

04:37:39.174 --> 04:37:39.535
Thank you.

04:37:39.815 --> 04:37:41.676
My name is Praveen and I'm from San Francisco.

04:37:42.316 --> 04:37:45.418
I wanted to hear because I'm queer, I'm Hindu, and I'm Californian.

04:37:46.639 --> 04:37:50.682
And I'm here to say, to request to say no on the textbooks and to delay the approval vote.

04:37:51.643 --> 04:37:54.384
As a queer desi, I believe that queer liberation is connected to all people.

04:37:55.225 --> 04:38:06.973
My family is actually upper caste, and the caste that I can tell you is a very real living issue and affects lots of people, to the extent that my grandmother had issues sharing the same food or touching the same people.

04:38:07.913 --> 04:38:11.976
As I grew up, I've met folks from lots of different walks of life.

04:38:12.056 --> 04:38:18.760
My family also attempted to cut out the caste conversation, and they were ashamed of it, and for good reason.

04:38:19.740 --> 04:38:23.943
But the reality is that there's millions of living, breathing people

04:38:24.503 --> 04:38:36.449
some of whom are in this room that have lived experience of their identity and their religion and their place in the Indian society and in the diaspora.

04:38:36.929 --> 04:38:39.831
And by erasing caste, you're erasing their lived experience.

04:38:39.891 --> 04:38:40.471
Thank you so much.

04:38:43.376 --> 04:38:48.477
My name is Bulvinder Kaur, and I work with the Jigar Movement and with high school students from 14 high schools in the greater Sacramento area.

04:38:48.497 --> 04:38:54.879
I've seen firsthand the discrimination of Sikhs in schools and witnessed the lack of representation and misinformation of Sikhs in the textbook.

04:38:55.239 --> 04:38:58.800
Furthermore, it is evident that there is Islamophobic language, um, that exists.

04:38:59.000 --> 04:39:07.062
As a Sikh, I not only advocate for accurate and inclusive language for Sikhs, but also LGBTQ+, Muslims, Buddhists, Dalits, and all groups that aren't being accurately included.

04:39:07.442 --> 04:39:12.883
We must recognize that flaws in our system exist to be, to be privileged and to be in spaces like this.

04:39:13.323 --> 04:39:19.386
You must be able to have transportation to downtown Sacramento and be able to give up a day's pay to be here in this space.

04:39:19.706 --> 04:39:21.927
We should recognize who is not in this space as well.

04:39:22.307 --> 04:39:28.710
We've gone through the process, you've established the framework, so we ask you to enforce that framework and fix the mistakes.

04:39:29.131 --> 04:39:37.635
I hope you will actively work with historians and individuals who work on the real histories and not promote alternative facts created by majority groups with money.

04:39:38.115 --> 04:39:38.415
Thank you.

04:39:45.208 --> 04:39:52.370
Respected members of the State Board of Education, my name is Aditi Varma and I am a resident of Mountain House and a freshman attending Mountain House High School.

04:39:52.951 --> 04:40:01.914
About one in eight people who responded to a bullying on Hindu American Children's Survey said that their teachers had made sarcastic remarks about Hinduism in front of the entire class.

04:40:02.534 --> 04:40:07.576
A student quoted in Port mentions that, after being made fun of by people I thought were my friends,

04:40:09.978 --> 04:40:15.444
I didn't tell anybody else I was Hindu, so I don't experience problems so much as I feel awkward sometimes.

04:40:16.324 --> 04:40:20.689
There have also been reports of deep emotional scarring because of bullying incidents.

04:40:21.130 --> 04:40:27.416
Being a Hindu girl myself, I know that I was crushed inside when I learnt information like this and when these incidents happened to me.

04:40:28.377 --> 04:40:35.340
And I would like to also say that I'm grateful to IQC for rejecting two of HMH's programs, which are blatantly racist and hinduphobic.

04:40:35.920 --> 04:40:47.806
I request you to take all the recommendations of the academic coalition by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other top academicians and import SBE to reject the programs of HMS as recommended.

04:40:48.406 --> 04:40:48.646
Thank you.

04:40:52.810 --> 04:40:53.390
Good afternoon.

04:40:53.510 --> 04:40:54.351
My name is Saithi.

04:40:54.651 --> 04:41:00.754
I'm a sixth grader in Simi Valley Unified School District and I drove six hours missing school today to show my opposition to bullying.

04:41:01.174 --> 04:41:07.117
Every one out of three Hindu-American children has reported that of being bullied based on religious beliefs and practices.

04:41:07.617 --> 04:41:11.979
Many of my friends have been teased based on Hinduism in ancient India taught in class.

04:41:12.519 --> 04:41:17.461
Hence it is extremely important that the hatred and the bias in the textbooks be addressed immediately.

04:41:18.182 --> 04:41:21.163
I stand here in solidarity with all the Hindu-American children

04:41:21.683 --> 04:41:24.206
who have been bullied and who have faced hatred in classrooms.

04:41:24.406 --> 04:41:24.746
Thank you.

04:41:33.034 --> 04:41:33.795
Hello everyone.

04:41:34.236 --> 04:41:34.836
Namaste.

04:41:34.856 --> 04:41:43.485
I am Shravani Balapalli, a fourth grader at Red Oak Elementary School in Oak Park, Los Angeles, and I am the sister of a sixth grader.

04:41:44.688 --> 04:41:46.829
I miss my school today to make myself heard.

04:41:47.489 --> 04:41:53.811
I fully support the recommendation of IQC to reject the textbooks of HMH.

04:41:53.831 --> 04:41:59.092
I request you to dismiss all such drafts which promote negative impressions like my sister's textbook.

04:41:59.693 --> 04:42:00.673
Let me tell you why.

04:42:01.393 --> 04:42:13.097
When my parents and my sister were discussing my culture and religion and how it was described in my sister's social science book, I felt so confused and worried by the way how it is portrayed.

04:42:13.757 --> 04:42:20.360
We know of an older friend who came home crying because of being bullied in school after the lessons on Hinduism.

04:42:21.140 --> 04:42:27.463
I don't want my friends to look down upon me for the unfair message the sixth grade textbook is trying to convey.

04:42:28.383 --> 04:42:37.467
Instead of focusing on the negativity, it can focus on so many positive aspects such as dance, music, culture, festivals.

04:42:38.488 --> 04:42:38.848
Thank you.

04:42:43.396 --> 04:42:50.660
Respected members of SBE, I am Krishna Pandey and I live in Rancho Cordova City.

04:42:51.341 --> 04:42:58.485
I support the recommendation made by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other academic people.

04:42:59.525 --> 04:43:09.352
I commanded and fully support the decision of IQC to reject the two programs of HMH.

04:43:10.213 --> 04:43:15.837
These programs are reject Hindu phobic and bad in qualities.

04:43:16.317 --> 04:43:17.398
They have numerous

04:43:20.894 --> 04:43:36.657
violation of category 1.0 of adoption guidelines, which prohibits adverse reflection based on religion and ethnicity.

04:43:37.297 --> 04:43:44.558
They also violate the California law, which prohibits religious discrimination.

04:43:44.778 --> 04:43:45.118
Time.

04:43:47.519 --> 04:43:48.299
Okay, thank you.

04:43:51.215 --> 04:43:52.796
Namaste, respected board members.

04:43:53.356 --> 04:43:57.378
I'm the Rekha, parent from San Jose.

04:43:58.599 --> 04:44:06.123
I'm closely following the textbook adoption process and I am here today to oppose hatred against Hindus and Indians.

04:44:06.744 --> 04:44:14.028
I would like to emphasize on the fact that the main source of education for kids is from textbooks and teachers.

04:44:14.828 --> 04:44:21.130
It clearly shows biased content against Indian civilization and Hinduism in these drafts.

04:44:21.910 --> 04:44:26.931
This misinformation leads to polluting young minds and bullying.

04:44:27.772 --> 04:44:39.655
Though I appreciate and stand by IQC's recommendations to reject HMH series, I request you to please reject series from McGraw Hill who are on the same path.

04:44:40.595 --> 04:44:47.799
I also support the academic coalition letter by Professor Long and other 38 scholars.

04:44:48.459 --> 04:44:53.182
I humbly suggest SBE to please accept their recommendations.

04:44:53.382 --> 04:44:53.742
Thank you.

04:44:53.782 --> 04:44:54.082
Time.

04:45:01.786 --> 04:45:04.287
Respected members of SBE, namaste.

04:45:05.328 --> 04:45:09.410
My name is Jaswanti Chander and I am an Indo-Fijian

04:45:10.568 --> 04:45:11.728
and born a Hindu.

04:45:15.030 --> 04:45:31.515
First of all, I sincerely want to thank the IQC's decision to reject Hilton Mifflin Harcourt because the textbooks are homophobic, Hindu homophobic.

04:45:32.255 --> 04:45:35.716
So I feel rejecting this is not enough.

04:45:38.271 --> 04:45:46.996
The seven textbooks, the seven great textbooks completely reglosses scientific achievements, aesthetics and philosophy.

04:45:48.556 --> 04:45:55.920
Even the whole bhakti movement within the Hinduism is reduced to a single mention.

04:45:56.841 --> 04:46:02.784
And I can speak with experience because I worked in the school system for 15 years.

04:46:02.884 --> 04:46:03.424
Thank you, ma'am.

04:46:09.179 --> 04:46:11.861
Respected members of SBE, sadar namaste.

04:46:11.881 --> 04:46:16.624
I am Uma Singh and I am born a Hindu.

04:46:17.464 --> 04:46:22.628
I support the recommendation of Professor Jeffrey Long and the 38 other academicians.

04:46:24.136 --> 04:46:30.117
I commend and fully support the decision of IQC to reject the two programs of HMC.

04:46:30.677 --> 04:46:37.338
These programs are bluntly racist, Hinduphobic, homophobic, and worst in quality.

04:46:37.958 --> 04:46:51.461
They have numerous violations of Category 1 of Adoption Guidelines, especially Category 1.10, which prohibits adverse reflection based on religion and tendency.

04:46:52.862 --> 04:46:58.726
May I ask to reject racist publishers like McGraw-Hill, HMH, and Discovery.

04:46:59.067 --> 04:47:02.770
Please, I say please stop hatred against Hindus.

04:47:03.010 --> 04:47:05.332
Stop demonization of Hindus.

04:47:05.572 --> 04:47:06.373
Thank you so much.

04:47:12.287 --> 04:47:17.550
Dear SBE and dignitaries on the dais, my name is Anil Anam.

04:47:18.451 --> 04:47:22.253
I'm a proud Hindu, resident of United States for last 19 years.

04:47:22.533 --> 04:47:24.494
My kids are in the college of the US system.

04:47:25.695 --> 04:47:28.616
Hinduism is one of the most tolerant religion on the Earth.

04:47:29.277 --> 04:47:31.218
That's a known fact to everyone.

04:47:32.058 --> 04:47:37.902
Not sure why the SIFA and other organizations are behind the Hindus for demonization of the Hinduism.

04:47:38.789 --> 04:47:46.373
Hinduism has given knowledge on mathematics, politics, yoga, astrology, sciences, and many other subjects.

04:47:47.194 --> 04:47:51.797
Every civilization has certain classifications which has pros and cons.

04:47:52.397 --> 04:48:04.524
But at the age of these kids learning about this, it's more to expose them the world of religions than portraying negative and inaccurate acts of a particular religion.

04:48:05.692 --> 04:48:09.495
I suspect I support completely the IQC recommendations.

04:48:10.276 --> 04:48:13.939
And moreover, this is the fight against the civil rights.

04:48:14.279 --> 04:48:15.880
This is not the fight against the civil rights.

04:48:15.960 --> 04:48:16.161
Yeah.

04:48:16.561 --> 04:48:19.964
It is more about our children learning about the world cultures.

04:48:20.124 --> 04:48:20.424
Thank you.

04:48:24.547 --> 04:48:25.088
Good afternoon.

04:48:25.368 --> 04:48:29.652
My name is Ganesh Sapate, a parent of two children from Castro Valley District.

04:48:30.672 --> 04:48:35.076
I fully support the decision of IQC to reject the two programs of HMU.

04:48:36.866 --> 04:48:48.089
These programs have numerous violations of Category 1 of Adoption Guidelines, especially Category 1.10 prohibits adverse reflection based on religion and ethnicity.

04:48:48.609 --> 04:48:52.671
They also violate the California law, which prohibits religious discrimination.

04:48:54.211 --> 04:49:06.933
I request SBE also to reject all this hateful content, some of which also represent in other books like National Geographic, and is being pushed by Hinduphobia groups at this last moment.

04:49:07.434 --> 04:49:07.735
Thank you.

04:49:16.018 --> 04:49:21.862
Hello, my name is Craig Givens, and I'm with the African American Education and Economic Policy Advocacy Group.

04:49:22.483 --> 04:49:23.283
I'm here with Ms.

04:49:23.323 --> 04:49:26.405
Taylor of the Black Parallel Education Board.

04:49:27.766 --> 04:49:33.831
I ask that you reject all the textbook adoptions for the eighth grade, history, social science.

04:49:34.771 --> 04:49:41.136
If your objective is to portray all people and communities fairly and accurately, you should reject these textbooks.

04:49:42.096 --> 04:49:46.078
A prime example is the way the Emancipation Proclamation is treated in your history books.

04:49:46.638 --> 04:49:51.740
Most people think that Abraham Lincoln woke up one day and thought freedom of slaves was a morally right thing to do.

04:49:52.100 --> 04:49:53.300
This is totally false.

04:49:54.441 --> 04:49:56.301
The North was losing the war to the South.

04:49:56.601 --> 04:49:57.602
Desertions were high.

04:49:58.522 --> 04:50:03.724
Issuing the Emancipation Proclamation provided 200,000 plus black troops union.

04:50:04.424 --> 04:50:08.686
Those black troops called the United States Colored Troops was a decisive factor in winning the Civil War.

04:50:09.446 --> 04:50:21.975
Failure to include Abraham Lincoln with the James L. Cochran stating exactly why he issued Emancipation Proclamation diminishes and undermined the contribution of black troops to winning the Civil War.

04:50:22.055 --> 04:50:22.375
Thank you.

04:50:27.679 --> 04:50:28.079
I'm courteous.

04:50:28.099 --> 04:50:35.404
So just remind the audience that we're going to say respectful and no sounds other than those that are speaking here at the podium.

04:50:35.464 --> 04:50:36.105
Thank you very much.

04:50:37.335 --> 04:50:39.417
I'm Curtis L. Gardner with the same organization.

04:50:40.097 --> 04:50:42.419
African American history must be contextualized.

04:50:42.800 --> 04:50:55.010
The technical vendors are not presenting African American event in context and I'm opposed to any product that are not adhering to laws and your state board policy and has an insufficiency issue.

04:50:56.280 --> 04:51:04.882
How many of you know if there had been no Emancipation Proclamation and the use of the United States Colored Troop, there would be no United States as we know it today.

04:51:05.543 --> 04:51:11.924
Most of you would be pledging allegiance to the Confederate flag of the Confederate States of America.

04:51:12.444 --> 04:51:17.286
Emancipation is just one of several issues that must be addressed and corrected.

04:51:17.946 --> 04:51:25.528
West End representative yesterday addressed the use of supplemental materials when he found that the information that he purchased was insufficient.

04:51:27.725 --> 04:51:30.506
The problem that we are discussing today is not new.

04:51:30.546 --> 04:51:33.847
It was addressed back in 1890, 127 years ago, in a history of the Negro race by Edward A. Johnson.

04:51:33.887 --> 04:51:34.367
Thank you so much.

04:51:54.861 --> 04:52:02.146
Hi, I am Nachi Apanmuthu Kumar and I am a 6th grader in Valley View Middle School in SVUSD.

04:52:02.707 --> 04:52:04.888
I am learning Hinduism in class.

04:52:05.289 --> 04:52:10.493
In the current books and upcoming editions, Hinduism is very poorly represented.

04:52:11.013 --> 04:52:12.254
Photos about Hinduism

04:52:13.911 --> 04:52:14.531
are negative.

04:52:14.671 --> 04:52:17.072
It shows something near the trash.

04:52:17.533 --> 04:52:22.375
Unfortunately I haven't seen anything positive about Hinduism in my textbooks.

04:52:23.215 --> 04:52:35.000
It is common for other kids in the class to look down upon me or my Hindu friends and our culture since it is misrepresented in the textbooks.

04:52:35.560 --> 04:52:36.560
It leads to bullying.

04:52:36.780 --> 04:52:42.823
Reject drafts of HMH and National Geographic as per IQC.

04:52:44.363 --> 04:52:44.743
Thank you.

04:52:51.184 --> 04:52:53.705
Dear respected members of State Board of Education.

04:52:54.265 --> 04:52:55.285
I am Saket Vennela.

04:52:55.685 --> 04:52:59.046
Sixth grade student from Portola Highly Gifted Magnet Los Angeles.

04:53:00.106 --> 04:53:05.888
I'm here to express my displeasure about the way Hinduism is portrayed in classrooms from a student's point of view.

04:53:07.308 --> 04:53:12.909
I felt very sad when I looked at the negative portrayal of Hinduism in National Geographic.

04:53:14.221 --> 04:53:16.822
The pictures related to Hindus are very derogatory.

04:53:17.762 --> 04:53:25.544
Core ideas of Hindus like Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, Universal Brotherhood, meditation, and I have no mention in these in the books though.

04:53:26.725 --> 04:53:31.126
I feel these textbooks are biased and encourage unfair treatment and bullying in schools.

04:53:32.166 --> 04:53:39.929
While I am very happy with IQC's decision to reject HMH books, I request you to please consider rejecting National Geographic.

04:53:40.429 --> 04:53:41.029
Thank you for your time.

04:53:44.565 --> 04:53:50.208
If I may stop the speakers for just one moment, currently we are on number 245.

04:53:50.268 --> 04:53:58.293
If you're in an overflow room and you have numbers 246 to 300, please make your way to line up in the main lobby.

04:53:58.433 --> 04:53:58.853
Thank you.

04:54:03.410 --> 04:54:03.990
Hello, everyone.

04:54:04.231 --> 04:54:04.711
Namaste.

04:54:04.931 --> 04:54:05.892
My name is Lakshmi.

04:54:06.392 --> 04:54:09.874
I'm a mother of three kids going to OPAR schools in Los Angeles.

04:54:10.495 --> 04:54:15.478
I support rejection of HMH by IQC, and I request you to confirm.

04:54:16.299 --> 04:54:26.666
The Hindu phobic group South Asian Histories for All is a group of political radicals and religious fundamentalists whose only aim is to perpetuate hatred against Hindus.

04:54:27.506 --> 04:54:32.810
All their edits only seek to adversely reflect on Hinduism while promoting their own religions.

04:54:33.831 --> 04:54:37.756
This is problematic and will create more social content violations in the book.

04:54:38.497 --> 04:54:41.480
This will also create violations of Category 1.10.

04:54:42.181 --> 04:54:48.309
I support edits given by Professor Geoffrey Lang and 38 other academicians.

04:54:48.750 --> 04:54:49.831
Please include them.

04:54:50.291 --> 04:54:50.672
Thank you.

04:54:56.556 --> 04:54:59.638
Respected member of State Board of Education, namaste to all.

04:55:00.359 --> 04:55:01.560
My name is Sandeep Karma.

04:55:01.580 --> 04:55:02.540
I am from Fremont.

04:55:03.261 --> 04:55:07.464
And I'm here in front of you to speak against the demonization of Hindu and Indians.

04:55:08.325 --> 04:55:22.034
I stand here with the support of Asians, LGBTQ communities, and the numerous Hindu, Jain, and interfaith groups, accommodations, educators, and thousands of Hindus and Indians across California.

04:55:23.095 --> 04:55:28.216
It is that textbooks have become a battle, a tool of spread political view.

04:55:28.856 --> 04:55:35.177
We all can have political views and opinion, but textbooks are not the place for such things.

04:55:35.917 --> 04:55:43.399
We want all children to become the respecting of each and others, not start hating to the each others.

04:55:44.119 --> 04:55:51.280
I stand here to support Jeffrey Long and 38 other accommodation who are seeking historical accuracy.

04:55:52.176 --> 04:55:58.960
I request that the recommendation by the Jeffrey Law and the academic group be accepted, addressed, and all problems in the books.

04:55:59.660 --> 04:56:00.060
Thank you.

04:56:03.542 --> 04:56:04.123
Good afternoon.

04:56:04.263 --> 04:56:05.563
My name is Chaitanya Devadkar.

04:56:05.583 --> 04:56:07.945
I'm with South Asian Histories for All.

04:56:08.445 --> 04:56:10.386
Hindu nationalism is like white nationalism.

04:56:11.086 --> 04:56:19.051
The oppressive history of the Hindu caste system is not up for debate, just as the horrors of slavery or the genocide of Native Americans are not up for debate.

04:56:19.731 --> 04:56:27.720
Contemporary reality is that since 2010, rapes of Dalit women have increased by 65%, kidnappings are up by 45% and killings have increased by 30%.

04:56:29.022 --> 04:56:33.006
At the same time, conviction rates have practically halved for crimes against Dalits.

04:56:33.487 --> 04:56:36.070
Caste oppression is alive and well in India and in the diaspora.

04:56:37.851 --> 04:56:44.577
As taxpayers, we expect public education to awaken and challenge students with the truth, not lull their blissful sleep with myths.

04:56:45.438 --> 04:56:50.602
I urge you to say no to Hindu nationalist mythology, enforce the framework, and fix the blatant lies.

04:56:50.642 --> 04:56:50.962
Thank you.

04:56:56.447 --> 04:57:01.191
I am Surendra Singh, president of Lakshmi Narayan Mandir.

04:57:01.897 --> 04:57:04.820
which is major Hindu-Issan in California.

04:57:06.081 --> 04:57:16.709
First of all, I give my respect to all the members of SBE and what Hinduism is, it's a very...

04:57:27.020 --> 04:57:33.824
I endorse all the remarks made here by various speakers, and I wish not to repeat them.

04:57:35.105 --> 04:57:43.149
But the violation made in the textbook is not only wrong, but it's injustice to Hinduism.

04:57:44.130 --> 04:57:55.796
Our temple, which is located at 7495 Elder Creek Road, it's open to any individual who likes and who wishes to visit, and we also welcome

04:57:56.377 --> 04:58:01.849
Non-Hindus, this is not... I'm sorry.

04:58:06.758 --> 04:58:09.179
Namaste, respected members of SBE.

04:58:09.819 --> 04:58:12.581
Teaching history comes with uniqueness challenge in the classroom.

04:58:12.781 --> 04:58:18.543
Hence, textbooks are not only have to be historically accurate, but also culturally competent.

04:58:19.904 --> 04:58:32.470
Material that failed to treat all cultures with fairness actually reflects upon the religious and cultural heritage of the children, cannot only lead to psychological problems within students, but can also encourage bullying of children.

04:58:33.170 --> 04:58:34.691
especially from minority communities.

04:58:35.331 --> 04:58:40.353
It poses severe challenge in creating a safe and a nurturing learning environment.

04:58:40.933 --> 04:58:46.675
We ask you to adopt new curriculum that will give our children access to accurate history.

04:58:46.975 --> 04:58:51.797
So we thank IQC and please reject HMS books.

04:58:52.477 --> 04:58:52.857
Thanks a lot.

04:58:58.018 --> 04:58:59.339
Good afternoon, all board members.

04:58:59.739 --> 04:59:03.341
I'm Milensha and Subramanian from Ambedkar King's Study Circle.

04:59:03.401 --> 04:59:05.502
We're representing South Asian history for all.

04:59:06.282 --> 04:59:09.024
The caste system is deep-rooted and cruel.

04:59:09.224 --> 04:59:15.727
For example, the seven-year-old Amruth Eswar Boy lives in Surendranagar district, Gujarat.

04:59:16.408 --> 04:59:26.373
Discriminated in a public school, he was forced to clean the toilets and made to sit separately and forced to handle the human waste.

04:59:27.398 --> 04:59:46.591
As Dr. Ambedkar writes, the modern Hindu realizes the wrong in caste, but he is ashamed to discuss caste in the public for fear of letting the foreigner know that Hindu civilization can be guilty of such a vicious and infamous system or social code as evidenced by untouchability.

04:59:46.931 --> 04:59:51.154
So I request you to enforce the framework and correct the mistakes.

04:59:51.434 --> 04:59:57.118
I would like my kids to understand the cost of caste oppression so that they can un-inhalate the caste.

04:59:57.618 --> 04:59:58.059
Thank you all.

04:59:58.099 --> 05:00:04.143
Hi, I'm a board member.

05:00:05.024 --> 05:00:06.385
My name is Kanak Natarajan.

05:00:06.945 --> 05:00:09.107
I'm a member of Ambedkar King Study Circle.

05:00:10.067 --> 05:00:13.670
I'm representing South Asian Histories for All Coalition.

05:00:14.991 --> 05:00:20.135
Hindu practice is cast every day, everywhere, even in US.

05:00:22.105 --> 05:00:30.211
Best example, all of your phone, just take your phone and go to google.com and type p.v.sindhu.

05:00:30.571 --> 05:00:34.914
The first hit you will get is that PV Sindhu cast.

05:00:35.074 --> 05:00:42.900
PV Sindhu, she's a 2016 Olympic medalist, first woman to get a medal in India.

05:00:43.840 --> 05:00:55.863
When the California textbooks say that today, Hindus in India and US don't practice, don't identify, don't practice the caste, which is untrue.

05:00:55.963 --> 05:00:57.083
That's totally not true.

05:00:57.443 --> 05:01:02.504
So the first hit you get on the top of the- Time.

05:01:02.664 --> 05:01:03.344
Yeah.

05:01:03.765 --> 05:01:09.806
So I request all of you to enter the framework and correct the mistakes.

05:01:09.886 --> 05:01:10.166
Thank you.

05:01:13.638 --> 05:01:15.200
Namaste, respected board members.

05:01:15.961 --> 05:01:18.463
I'm Madan Gumbineni, and I have a fifth grade son.

05:01:18.964 --> 05:01:23.489
As a parent, I always taught my son about the ancient glory of Hindu heritage.

05:01:23.729 --> 05:01:27.914
I don't want my son to feel inferior about the syllabus in California textbooks.

05:01:29.266 --> 05:01:30.506
Finally, I want peace.

05:01:31.106 --> 05:01:32.987
I want my son to have a peaceful life.

05:01:33.607 --> 05:01:35.247
OK, this is the only one thing we are here.

05:01:35.567 --> 05:01:36.187
We are all here.

05:01:36.307 --> 05:01:40.468
As parents, we want to see our kids to grow in a peaceful environment.

05:01:40.748 --> 05:01:43.848
We don't want them to be bullied by anyone, nothing, right?

05:01:44.849 --> 05:01:49.189
Finally, I want to say only one thing is stop hatred against Hinduism.

05:01:49.689 --> 05:01:56.731
I trust the board members will hear our plea and reject HMS2 programs and recommended by IQC.

05:01:57.051 --> 05:01:57.711
Thank you so much.

05:01:58.291 --> 05:01:58.651
Namaste.

05:02:03.140 --> 05:02:03.881
respect of the board.

05:02:04.861 --> 05:02:05.502
My name is Harish.

05:02:05.542 --> 05:02:06.822
I'm from Arcadia, California.

05:02:07.603 --> 05:02:20.311
A lot has been spoken today about the misrepresentation of India and Hinduism in the HMH programs, and like many others, I drove 400 miles to support the decision of IQC to reject the programs of HMH.

05:02:21.232 --> 05:02:30.758
All that I ask for today is to have a very belief and purpose statement defined by the California Department of Education, which is to prepare the students to live, work, and thrive in a multilingual

05:02:31.258 --> 05:02:32.299
multicultural world.

05:02:32.959 --> 05:02:38.503
How can we boast of working towards this mission by portraying a specific religion, Hinduism, in the bad light?

05:02:39.244 --> 05:02:47.409
It is unfortunate that there are specific organizations who are trying to perpetuating hatred against Hinduism and instigating the hatred ideology among our kids.

05:02:48.190 --> 05:02:53.693
Members, we have a huge responsibility to ensure that our kids are taught the right content so they have a better tomorrow.

05:02:54.955 --> 05:03:02.173
I hope that you will take strong consideration of all the facts presented by my brothers and sisters and reject the two HMH programs recommended by IQC.

05:03:02.514 --> 05:03:02.775
Thank you.

05:03:07.486 --> 05:03:07.946
Namaste.

05:03:08.587 --> 05:03:11.489
I'm a parent of a sixth grader from Southern California.

05:03:12.089 --> 05:03:17.092
I support the recommendations of Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other academicians.

05:03:17.713 --> 05:03:26.899
Please consider all the changes and reject the drafts of McGraw-Hill National Geographic as not suitable for use in California's public school curriculum.

05:03:27.439 --> 05:03:42.163
They depict inaccurate descriptions of core concepts and scriptures in Hinduism, Indian social structures, and the use of the outdated and colonial era theories of Aryanism and Brahmanism to describe the origins of Indian civilization and Hinduism.

05:03:42.683 --> 05:03:54.867
They are against the free and stated objectives of California's education code and the standards for evaluating instructional materials for social content, which prohibit any group from being portrayed adversely or as inferior.

05:03:55.507 --> 05:03:56.808
Thank you all for your patience.

05:03:57.148 --> 05:04:03.771
Thank you.

05:04:03.811 --> 05:04:04.832
My name is Venkatesh.

05:04:05.452 --> 05:04:07.353
I'm coming from Folsom.

05:04:08.334 --> 05:04:18.019
Thank you very much for taking the time and your patience for listening quite intently with all of us being talking and hope you have understood what we are trying to say.

05:04:18.579 --> 05:04:20.240
And I just want to tell one thing.

05:04:20.841 --> 05:04:25.043
I don't want to read that same, again, just want to tell one word about Hinduism.

05:04:25.524 --> 05:04:34.309
I came, I'm really proud of it because it promotes Vasudhaiva Kuktumbam, which is a core concept of United Nations, which is the need of the hour every single day.

05:04:34.349 --> 05:04:39.052
We cannot live in a fair place where we hate each other and we don't trust each other.

05:04:39.293 --> 05:04:40.373
This is the concept.

05:04:40.493 --> 05:04:44.376
It is not, Hinduism is not just a word or at least a way of living.

05:04:44.756 --> 05:04:52.122
That's why so many countries, so many countries, even though I have been away from my country for 10 years, but I'm still connected to it.

05:04:52.742 --> 05:04:58.106
So long as my wife, my kids also wanted to be knowing that vast heritage.

05:04:58.586 --> 05:05:01.829
They just wanted to know, it's not just because we are Hindus.

05:05:01.849 --> 05:05:02.129
Time.

05:05:02.249 --> 05:05:04.231
We wanted to be universal.

05:05:04.271 --> 05:05:04.971
Time.

05:05:05.372 --> 05:05:05.932
Thank you very much.

05:05:10.999 --> 05:05:19.648
Respected board, I'm a Dalit and I experienced caste till I come to United States 18 years ago.

05:05:20.549 --> 05:05:23.392
Do I have to confront this monster even in this country?

05:05:23.893 --> 05:05:24.854
You have to think about it.

05:05:25.396 --> 05:05:31.178
We may be very small in number, but you can understand who is speaking from the heart and who is not.

05:05:31.538 --> 05:05:32.258
I think you can.

05:05:32.878 --> 05:05:37.499
And in case of race, as in case of race, caste has beneficiaries and victims.

05:05:38.079 --> 05:05:44.621
The beneficiaries want to continue by not talking it, whereas the victims want to destroy it and exposing it.

05:05:45.709 --> 05:05:52.293
An African-American slave or a Nazi or a Jew would tell you what they have faced in those days.

05:05:52.913 --> 05:05:54.874
Same way, but it is dismantled already.

05:05:55.254 --> 05:06:00.297
But in case of caste, still we are facing it in India, as well as here also.

05:06:00.357 --> 05:06:06.540
If this is continuous, America is going to have capital, as Dr. Mitchell had already spoke about it.

05:06:07.301 --> 05:06:07.541
OK.

05:06:07.961 --> 05:06:10.403
And the worst victims.

05:06:10.743 --> 05:06:11.283
Thank you very much.

05:06:12.584 --> 05:06:16.027
Before we have the next speaker, I have an announcement to make.

05:06:17.648 --> 05:06:20.410
I would like to thank everyone for their testimony.

05:06:21.010 --> 05:06:29.136
We have heard from a large number of you today and hearing members of the public have continued to sign up to speak as the item has been progressing.

05:06:30.097 --> 05:06:38.283
However, the State Board of Education by law needs to be able to maintain a quorum to allow for action by the board today.

05:06:39.338 --> 05:06:47.322
Therefore, pursuant to Title V, Section 952, we will have to end public comment at 5 p.m.

05:06:47.382 --> 05:06:54.446
today in order to maintain the quorum so we can act one way or another on this issue today.

05:06:55.426 --> 05:07:00.569
In order to allow as many people as possible to speak, we would like to encourage the following.

05:07:01.405 --> 05:07:13.890
Instead of reading your entire state only your position, such as I support or oppose the IQC's recommendation, come up as a group and designate one person to speak for one minute.

05:07:14.770 --> 05:07:16.751
All people will then give up their tickets.

05:07:17.752 --> 05:07:23.774
If you don't speak but have a written statement, please provide it to a staff member and it will be part of the record.

05:07:24.474 --> 05:07:27.255
So we will end testimony at five today.

05:07:27.435 --> 05:07:30.657
In order to act, we must end it.

05:07:30.737 --> 05:07:31.097
Thank you.

05:07:33.939 --> 05:07:34.944
Go ahead, next speaker.

05:07:38.493 --> 05:07:40.134
Good afternoon, respected board members.

05:07:41.395 --> 05:07:42.876
I am Balaji from Pleasanton.

05:07:43.396 --> 05:07:50.201
I'm here to support Geoffrey Long and other 38 economists who are seeking historical accuracy.

05:07:50.681 --> 05:07:59.247
I request that the recommendation by Geoffrey Long and the academic group be accepted to address all the problems in the book.

05:07:59.867 --> 05:08:04.430
It's sad that textbooks become a battle towards political views.

05:08:04.851 --> 05:08:06.552
We can all have political views,

05:08:07.052 --> 05:08:11.056
and opinion, but textbooks are not the place for such views.

05:08:11.577 --> 05:08:17.723
We want all children to become respecting of each other and not start hating each other.

05:08:17.984 --> 05:08:18.284
Thank you.

05:08:23.850 --> 05:08:27.732
My name is Rishi Modi and I'm a sophomore at Amador Valley High School.

05:08:28.013 --> 05:08:28.753
I live in Pleasanton.

05:08:29.313 --> 05:08:37.698
As a living resident of California, I felt that my presence is needed here today because of the hatred, racism, and prejudice that is being instilled in today's young adults.

05:08:39.190 --> 05:08:49.580
I believe that nobody is above the law, so why do we allow such big tech companies such as McLaughlin and McGraw-Hill to break the law by discriminating against hardworking Americans just because of their race or skin color?

05:08:50.061 --> 05:09:00.211
If this is the type of learning that we are instilling into our children, no wonder they grow up to learn that just because somebody is of a different skin color, they are lower than us.

05:09:00.752 --> 05:09:01.012
Thank you.

05:09:07.722 --> 05:09:08.143
Thank you.

05:09:09.765 --> 05:09:11.689
My name is Gi-An Chan.

05:09:12.510 --> 05:09:14.133
I'm a retired high school teacher.

05:09:15.695 --> 05:09:21.165
Now I work with the Sacramento Elder Creek Hindu Temple.

05:09:23.719 --> 05:09:33.146
And I want to sort of say that Hinduism practices non-discrimination and loves all the religion.

05:09:33.166 --> 05:09:40.191
And at Hilda Creek Hindu temple, everyone is welcome.

05:09:40.911 --> 05:09:47.756
And if we are invited by other churches or religion, we do as much supporting as possible.

05:09:48.857 --> 05:09:54.022
So this publication in school, I don't think it's desirable.

05:09:54.042 --> 05:10:00.888
Our children should be taught to love all the religion and all the culture.

05:10:02.140 --> 05:10:05.283
And I may have been in over while this went on.

05:10:05.303 --> 05:10:17.872
I would very humbly request the board to remove this from the textbook so that we don't discriminate against one or the other religion.

05:10:17.892 --> 05:10:18.193
Thank you.

05:10:18.213 --> 05:10:19.273
Can we have the next speaker?

05:10:19.313 --> 05:10:19.934
Thank you so much.

05:10:24.329 --> 05:10:25.370
Good afternoon, everyone.

05:10:26.130 --> 05:10:27.631
My name is Rucha Chitnis.

05:10:28.072 --> 05:10:32.535
I'm here as a photojournalist, writer, and a women's rights advocate.

05:10:33.535 --> 05:10:38.819
Right now, sexual harassment and violence against women is foremost on our minds.

05:10:39.619 --> 05:10:48.245
And as a journalist, I've heard firsthand testimonies of Dalm about the structure of caste exacerbates violence against women.

05:10:48.926 --> 05:10:50.387
And as an upper caste feminist,

05:10:51.067 --> 05:10:59.451
I think we cannot, in our right conscience, erase the intersectionality of caste in our academia and in our history books.

05:11:00.091 --> 05:11:05.934
So I sincerely urge you to delay the vote, enforce the frameworks, and fix the mistakes.

05:11:06.214 --> 05:11:06.574
Thank you.

05:11:11.417 --> 05:11:13.019
Hi, I'm Nolan.

05:11:13.259 --> 05:11:16.182
I'm from Bay Area, part of the Ambedkar-Kingsbury Circle.

05:11:17.843 --> 05:11:23.248
For centuries, Dalits all over India have been forced to do the dirty jobs.

05:11:23.508 --> 05:11:25.871
They have been forced to clean the human fecal waste.

05:11:26.671 --> 05:11:30.835
All other jobs have been denied to them for centuries because of the Hindu caste system.

05:11:31.949 --> 05:11:33.690
These jobs are often fatal.

05:11:34.391 --> 05:11:38.553
This is happening even while there are laws banning manual scavenging.

05:11:39.234 --> 05:11:45.698
There is no other reason for the existence of this horrific practice than persistence of Hindu caste system.

05:11:46.679 --> 05:11:49.541
For the textbooks, please try to deny.

05:11:50.161 --> 05:11:52.543
Trying to deny the caste system is unconscionable.

05:11:52.763 --> 05:11:53.003
Thank you.

05:11:58.877 --> 05:12:08.462
Respected board members, I am Prashant and I have come down from Seattle over here because whatever decision you guys take will have implication on my son as well.

05:12:10.704 --> 05:12:25.252
I am from India and I am also a Hindu but I happen to be from the privileged caste and I can totally understand why some of the members of my strata of society are going to downplay the issue of caste.

05:12:25.912 --> 05:12:33.314
It's simply because we are blind to it and we are unable to see the implications on the underprivileged section of our society.

05:12:34.275 --> 05:12:44.938
So instead of taking this decision based on emotional value, I implore the board to take decision based on the scientifically available major historians of the world.

05:12:45.178 --> 05:12:45.418
Thank you.

05:12:57.793 --> 05:12:58.814
Good afternoon.

05:12:58.894 --> 05:13:02.416
My name is Michael Ramirez, son of Lorenzo Ramirez, who is part of this case.

05:13:02.837 --> 05:13:07.940
It is my understanding that Mendez v. Westminster, as it's called by some, is in the curriculum.

05:13:08.641 --> 05:13:11.122
This book that I hold is narrated by Sylvia Mendez.

05:13:11.863 --> 05:13:13.804
It is being used as a third grade study book.

05:13:14.065 --> 05:13:18.808
It is filled with the same narrow narratives of the case along with the untruths of the adult books.

05:13:19.329 --> 05:13:22.030
But this story has found a new home in the children's section.

05:13:22.391 --> 05:13:23.851
I believe the thinking is the children's.

05:13:23.871 --> 05:13:32.156
To my surprise, they have stooped to a new low by entering Mr. Estrada into the suit as a returning World War II soldier angered by segregation.

05:13:32.496 --> 05:13:34.677
Problem is Mr. Estrada was never in the military.

05:13:35.417 --> 05:13:42.023
There was untruth has strained the trust of the et al families involved with the point of not allowing any more interviews including the lawyers family.

05:13:42.103 --> 05:13:47.829
Mr. Marcus was instrumental in not only civil rights but human rights in the Mexican people whether citizens of the U.S.

05:13:48.309 --> 05:13:50.091
or Mexican citizens living in the U.S.

05:13:50.111 --> 05:13:51.172
through the Mexican consulate.

05:13:51.732 --> 05:13:54.415
Mendez and Roby are not reliable gatekeepers of this history.

05:13:54.475 --> 05:13:59.059
I ask the board to add fresh eyes to teaching our children this very important California history.

05:13:59.179 --> 05:13:59.819
Thank you very much.

05:13:59.839 --> 05:14:00.180
Thank you.

05:14:00.960 --> 05:14:01.421
Next speaker.

05:14:01.960 --> 05:14:02.901
My name is Peter Friedrich.

05:14:03.382 --> 05:14:06.506
Today you are witnessing an attempt to tell history by mob rule.

05:14:06.986 --> 05:14:18.921
Funded by Hindu nationalists from India who massacre Christians, Sikhs, and Muslims, and daily subjugate, beat, rape, and murder Dalits, this mob demands revisionist history which erases the reality of subjugation in South Asia.

05:14:19.542 --> 05:14:28.645
They want you to teach that caste creates social stability, that outcasts chose garbage picking as their profession because they were good at it, and Hindus in India and abroad rarely even practice caste.

05:14:29.165 --> 05:14:35.487
Some moneyed and upper-caste people in California want to conceal the ongoing caste oppression of India's poorest and most downtrodden people.

05:14:36.028 --> 05:14:46.191
If white nationalists or the KKK demanded textbooks teach that apartheid created social stability, or that Africans came to work at southern plantations to pick cotton picking, would you cave to the mob pressure?

05:14:46.980 --> 05:14:53.754
Or will you teach Californian students true, factual, accurate history instead of biased, partisan, mythologized history?

05:14:53.915 --> 05:14:54.496
Thank you for your time.

05:14:58.186 --> 05:14:58.906
Good afternoon.

05:14:59.166 --> 05:15:02.947
I'm Carolyn Laub, coordinator of the Fair Education Act Implementation Coalition.

05:15:02.967 --> 05:15:10.208
I'll start by thanking the IQC members for their commitment to ensuring that LGBT people are included in the materials under consideration.

05:15:10.629 --> 05:15:15.650
You're now poised to make history by approving the first LGBT-inclusive textbooks in the nation.

05:15:16.450 --> 05:15:20.350
Our coalition agrees with the IQC's recommendations to approve 10 of the programs.

05:15:20.771 --> 05:15:27.192
We also support the LGBT-related edits submitted by Hill, Studies Weekly, and National Geographic since the IQC's September meeting.

05:15:27.992 --> 05:15:36.119
We also urge you to reject both HMH programs, which did not align with the framework or social content standards, by excluding LGBT people.

05:15:36.619 --> 05:15:43.444
Rectifying that exclusion would require substantial rewrites, and all of that content has not gone through a thorough public review.

05:15:43.685 --> 05:15:53.352
Your historic decision today will ensure that the only materials adopted for use in California K-8 classrooms include a full and accurate account of the roles and contributions of LGBT people in history.

05:15:53.453 --> 05:15:53.793
Thank you.

05:16:00.117 --> 05:16:00.737
Good afternoon.

05:16:01.418 --> 05:16:02.378
My name is Rick Acolto.

05:16:02.478 --> 05:16:08.622
I am the educator at our coalition and also a member of the Fair Education Act Implementation Coalition.

05:16:09.663 --> 05:16:13.725
We request that you affirm the recommendations made by the Instructional Quality Commission.

05:16:14.165 --> 05:16:24.591
While we had originally recommended the rejection of Studies Weekly, we give our provisional support of the publication only given that the recently submitted edits on LG3 by them are accepted.

05:16:25.632 --> 05:16:37.235
From the beginning, we have wanted nothing more than to have fair, accurate, inclusive, and respectful representations of the roles and contributions from LGBT members and communities.

05:16:37.995 --> 05:16:51.418
In recent public discourse that emphasizes difference and division, it is our sincere hope that we can build empathy across our differences by learning about one another, our backgrounds, our cultures, and our experiences.

05:16:52.398 --> 05:16:57.946
Community is built by acknowledging and celebrating one another and investing in the rich diversity that we each bring.

05:16:58.507 --> 05:17:04.076
History may be in the past, but how we talk about it and how we represent each other will determine how they're in the future.

05:17:04.636 --> 05:17:04.937
Thank you.

05:17:10.379 --> 05:17:11.259
Good afternoon, everyone.

05:17:11.319 --> 05:17:12.820
My name is Crystal Torres-Cobrubias.

05:17:12.900 --> 05:17:25.884
I'm the Out for Safe Schools coordinator at the Los Angeles LGBT Center, and I want to share with you an event that we had a few weeks ago with the Latino Equality Alliance, an LGBTQ advocacy group in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, where we brought awareness to the Fair Education Act.

05:17:26.244 --> 05:17:27.804
About 80 community members came out.

05:17:27.824 --> 05:17:29.765
50 of those community members were students.

05:17:30.365 --> 05:17:35.467
Of the 50 students that were there, only two could name an LGBTQ person who contributed to history.

05:17:36.307 --> 05:17:39.948
Admittedly, those people they learned about were not people they learned about in their classrooms.

05:17:40.572 --> 05:17:47.634
From my experience at that event and my experience working with LGBTQ youth advocates, I know that LGBTQ youth are ready for this content.

05:17:48.134 --> 05:17:52.936
The spirit of the Fair Education Act is to give all students access to diverse and accurate history.

05:17:53.456 --> 05:17:59.378
That cannot happen unless every single state-approved instructional program is fully and equally compliant with the law.

05:17:59.798 --> 05:18:05.620
I urge you to follow the recommendations of the IQC and the Fair Education Limitation Coalition and reject both

05:18:07.523 --> 05:18:12.101
both HMH programs as they fail to fully reflect LGBTQ history.

05:18:12.301 --> 05:18:12.542
Thank you.

05:18:15.967 --> 05:18:18.888
Good afternoon, SBE members.

05:18:18.928 --> 05:18:22.589
Thank you so much for your service and for welcoming us here today.

05:18:22.649 --> 05:18:28.390
I want to start by thanking the IQC members for their thorough revision and the panelists as well.

05:18:29.350 --> 05:18:30.791
It's a very complicated process.

05:18:30.951 --> 05:18:39.273
And as a member of the FAIR Act Implementation Coalition, I am here to say that they worked really hard with us and with the public, as you know.

05:18:39.853 --> 05:18:49.416
We are here also to urge you to reject the two techniques as they fail to accurately reflect the representations of LGBT people.

05:18:50.497 --> 05:19:00.240
And again, we urge you to accept the revisions that have been submitted by Studies Weekly as a mom of a child that is going to be going to Public School Systems California

05:19:00.880 --> 05:19:16.974
as an LGBT person myself and as the leader of our vision representing thousands of LGBT families in California would thank you as our families will be raised and grow up finally seeing themselves represented in history and social sciences in this state and modeling for the rest of the nation.

05:19:17.294 --> 05:19:17.875
Thank you so much.

05:19:22.799 --> 05:19:23.600
Hi, my name is Taylor.

05:19:23.620 --> 05:19:27.162
I'm from the California LGBT Health and Human Services Network.

05:19:28.382 --> 05:19:38.949
I am also a social worker, an instructor at California State University of Sacramento, and a mom to an eighth grader, most importantly, and I also identify as queer.

05:19:38.969 --> 05:19:42.090
I want to encourage you to

05:19:43.431 --> 05:19:55.978
The recommendations of the IQC, I think they did a really great job of listening to our concerns and only approving the curriculum that was in line and actually accurately included LGBTQ history.

05:19:55.998 --> 05:20:04.302
And along with assuming that the edits are in place for McGraw-Hill and studies weekly that you adopt those.

05:20:05.043 --> 05:20:05.343
Thank you.

05:20:08.888 --> 05:20:09.949
Good afternoon.

05:20:10.609 --> 05:20:12.210
My name is Cal Zielinski.

05:20:13.231 --> 05:20:21.296
I'm a member of the LGBTQ community and I'm a graduate student in social work and a part of the larger community you represent.

05:20:21.797 --> 05:20:29.122
I am a student that not so long ago, in service of absence of accurate depictions of historical figures from my community and other marginalized communities.

05:20:29.582 --> 05:20:38.528
And I cannot begin to describe the effect of this historical erasure and bias these textbooks has had on the self-image of students like myself and my classmates.

05:20:39.308 --> 05:20:46.690
In support of the Fair Education Implementation Coalition, I convey support for the edits that the National Geographic submitted on November 6th.

05:20:47.050 --> 05:20:51.312
They proposed additional edits to ensure the biographies of Charlie Parkhurst and James Adams are correct.

05:20:52.212 --> 05:21:01.534
And I support these and have suggested and the Fair Education Implementation Coalition has suggested that these edits be taken.

05:21:02.435 --> 05:21:06.796
National Geographic has these edits and based on the support, I would offer my full support

05:21:07.496 --> 05:21:13.398
And I believe I'm a part of the coalition in order to ensure this reflects the virus community.

05:21:13.498 --> 05:21:13.818
Thank you.

05:21:20.641 --> 05:21:21.061
Good evening.

05:21:22.162 --> 05:21:25.883
I'm Bali Abhay and myself, we represent ISCOM.

05:21:26.636 --> 05:21:34.181
and I endorse the recommendations of the Hindupedia and Professor Long because Mahatma Gandhi, he said, be the change you want to see.

05:21:34.781 --> 05:21:42.726
That means we would like to see the change which is adopted by the Indian culture, the yoga, the great traditions of Bhagavad Gita, which was written by A.C.

05:21:42.746 --> 05:21:48.349
Bhaktivedanta Upadhyay in order to establish the universal love and peace, just like Swami Vivekananda has said.

05:21:48.909 --> 05:21:51.253
and Gandhi has also enumerated the same.

05:21:51.353 --> 05:21:59.784
So my humble request that we really need to adopt the recommendations given by Hindupedia and the professors Long's, the coalition's accomplishments.

05:22:00.144 --> 05:22:03.609
So I'd like to thank you everyone to give an opportunity to speak much.

05:22:12.188 --> 05:22:12.469
Am I good?

05:22:13.572 --> 05:22:13.813
Hey there.

05:22:14.374 --> 05:22:15.637
My name's Anirvan Chatterjee.

05:22:15.998 --> 05:22:19.829
I'm a Hindu-American, and I'm here with the Interfaith South Asian Histories for All Coalition.

05:22:21.249 --> 05:22:22.430
We kind of all know what's going on here.

05:22:22.450 --> 05:22:31.335
There are 300-some people who have come here so far, and it isn't hard to get 300 white Southerners out to say that, let's not talk about slavery.

05:22:31.375 --> 05:22:31.995
It's inconvenient.

05:22:32.015 --> 05:22:32.676
It makes us feel bad.

05:22:32.916 --> 05:22:37.679
It's not hard to get 100 or 300 straight folks to come out and say, let's not talk about LGBTQ history.

05:22:37.699 --> 05:22:38.939
It kind of makes us feel bad.

05:22:39.480 --> 05:22:43.162
And it is not hard to get 300 Indian, Hindu, primarily Afrikaans people.

05:22:43.182 --> 05:22:44.503
People like a lot of people in this room.

05:22:45.123 --> 05:22:47.624
out to say, let's not talk about all these inconvenient histories.

05:22:47.704 --> 05:22:48.524
It makes us feel bad.

05:22:48.544 --> 05:22:49.445
We're feeling fragile.

05:22:50.245 --> 05:22:51.226
But we cannot do that.

05:22:51.726 --> 05:22:54.707
We cannot do that because Donald Trump pushes alternative facts.

05:22:54.747 --> 05:22:56.408
But for us, we are California.

05:22:56.928 --> 05:23:00.789
We are the state that protects Latinos, queer folks, that protects Muslims, that protects Dalits.

05:23:01.250 --> 05:23:04.691
And we really want to make sure that our history textbook, the truth about what's happening

05:23:05.151 --> 05:23:15.017
that we stand up for minority rights, we stand up for historical accuracy, we believe that you have the guts to stand up to people like me who are essentially the white folks of India.

05:23:15.217 --> 05:23:17.159
I love white people, but we're not the only ones.

05:23:17.439 --> 05:23:17.699
Thank you.

05:23:24.141 --> 05:23:25.242
So my name is Bernali.

05:23:25.262 --> 05:23:27.603
I'm also with the South Asian Histories for All Coalition.

05:23:28.264 --> 05:23:32.126
Coalitions are hard, and our coalition has over 20 organizations.

05:23:32.627 --> 05:23:37.650
We have queer activists, religious conservatives, atheists, tenured academics, and everyday community members.

05:23:38.150 --> 05:23:42.113
We are interfaith, intercaste, and we embrace this messy pluralism.

05:23:42.954 --> 05:23:45.275
We don't always, but we share some core values.

05:23:46.116 --> 05:23:53.561
Textbooks should be based on the best scholarship, they should be respectful and nuanced, and they shouldn't whitewash the truth or promote alternative facts.

05:23:54.401 --> 05:24:02.188
That's why we have come together to stand up against the Hindu lobbies pushing Islamophobia, caste denial and religious nationalism into our textbooks.

05:24:03.129 --> 05:24:05.170
We Belichians believe in dialogue.

05:24:05.531 --> 05:24:06.451
We believe in facts.

05:24:07.332 --> 05:24:08.193
And we believe in you.

05:24:09.494 --> 05:24:11.796
Because this is the best of what California can be.

05:24:12.977 --> 05:24:16.360
Will you stand up for true facts and accurate history?

05:24:17.421 --> 05:24:18.782
Please enforce the frameworks

05:24:20.370 --> 05:24:24.517
that we fought so hard to get right and stakes in our textbooks.

05:24:24.998 --> 05:24:28.644
Do not let alternative facts enter California textbooks.

05:24:28.984 --> 05:24:29.345
Thank you.

05:24:36.246 --> 05:24:37.447
My name's Elmer Sharegill.

05:24:37.707 --> 05:24:39.888
You should have all received a letter from the Sharegill law firm.

05:24:39.908 --> 05:24:40.428
I'm an attorney.

05:24:40.448 --> 05:24:46.252
I'm also a board member of the Sikh Temperamento, executive board member of the California Democratic Party.

05:24:46.272 --> 05:24:57.098
I urge you all to be very careful about overturning previous decisions of the board in a way that provides unequal, disparate treatment to a specific group that's lobbying you.

05:24:57.618 --> 05:24:59.179
You might open yourselves up to litigation.

05:24:59.199 --> 05:25:00.760
I urge you to be very careful about that.

05:25:01.020 --> 05:25:02.581
I'm not going to go into the details of the letter.

05:25:02.981 --> 05:25:08.624
But I'd like to say that on behalf of South Asian Histories for All, we should have empathy for the Hindu community.

05:25:08.644 --> 05:25:13.966
It is not their fault that they are Americans now and beneficiaries of an oppressive South Asian culture.

05:25:14.607 --> 05:25:24.831
We are all beneficiaries of genocide in this country, of slavery in this country, and yet we still want empathy from others, and we should give empathy to the Hindu community.

05:25:24.871 --> 05:25:27.573
However, we should have the courage to tell the truth.

05:25:28.753 --> 05:25:42.726
about internment of Japanese, about slavery, about Armenian genocide, and yes, about the oppression, rape, murder that we saw in South Asia and that we're asking for the truth to be told in these textbooks.

05:25:51.291 --> 05:25:53.313
Hello, I am Aditya Doke.

05:25:54.354 --> 05:26:01.642
I want to quote a concept from one of the Vedic literature which is Rig Veda.

05:26:02.082 --> 05:26:12.573
It was in 1500 BC and one of the concept says that the first class of people that is Brahmins was born out of the mouth.

05:26:13.153 --> 05:26:13.973
of the God.

05:26:14.974 --> 05:26:16.854
The second class was born out of the arms.

05:26:17.494 --> 05:26:21.315
The third class was born out of the thighs.

05:26:21.855 --> 05:26:24.956
And the lowest class was born out of the feet.

05:26:26.076 --> 05:26:35.679
And this is the Hindu literature which describes the social hierarchy and gave rise to the caste system.

05:26:36.019 --> 05:26:41.580
So to sum up, the word Hindu and caste are very deeply interconnected.

05:26:42.261 --> 05:26:45.691
So, I urge you, force the framework and fix the mistakes.

05:26:46.012 --> 05:26:46.272
Thank you.

05:26:51.229 --> 05:26:51.869
Hi.

05:26:51.989 --> 05:26:55.690
Thanks for giving this opportunity to speak up my voice here.

05:26:56.730 --> 05:27:01.712
Primarily, I am here for the ancient India portrayal in the textbooks.

05:27:02.212 --> 05:27:07.813
By the way, I am parent of 12 and 5, and they go to Folsom Cordova Unified School District.

05:27:08.453 --> 05:27:15.075
And I am really concerned about the way how the ancient India and Hinduism being portrayed in the upcoming textbooks.

05:27:16.455 --> 05:27:21.776
It is being using an unfair yardstick to depict the Hinduism in comparison to other religions.

05:27:22.356 --> 05:27:27.597
Each religion has its own, but the way how it is being depicted is very, very unfair.

05:27:28.517 --> 05:27:32.878
And it is actually implanting a wrong picture for the young generations to come.

05:27:33.518 --> 05:27:36.019
And that is not what Hinduism is about.

05:27:36.199 --> 05:27:43.060
And I urge the California Department of Education to make a corrective action to fix these textbooks.

05:27:55.130 --> 05:27:57.622
Dear members of the State Board of Education,

05:27:58.140 --> 05:28:03.102
My name is Ishan and I'm a student of William Freya Elementary School Cupertino.

05:28:03.122 --> 05:28:06.983
America teaches us equality and respect for all.

05:28:08.224 --> 05:28:12.965
As an American Hindu student I request equality for Hinduism.

05:28:13.606 --> 05:28:19.348
To me Hinduism means diversity universal peace and love for all living beings.

05:28:20.028 --> 05:28:24.450
I request you to reject the teachings that hatred among people.

05:28:24.850 --> 05:28:25.210
Thank you.

05:28:31.966 --> 05:28:37.914
Respected members of the State of Board Education, my name is Sriram Akurseti and I live in San Ramon.

05:28:38.214 --> 05:28:41.659
I have a middle school going son along with another attending college.

05:28:42.360 --> 05:28:47.987
First, I didn't believe when I heard the presentation of India and Indian culture in Harcourt's draft K-6 textbook.

05:28:49.028 --> 05:28:55.394
It shows ancient Indians in Harappa as tribal on page number 176 and 179, apart from many inaccuracies.

05:28:56.014 --> 05:29:01.539
It has such demeaning and belittling description of Indian culture dotted with many inaccuracies.

05:29:02.279 --> 05:29:07.464
It creates inferiority in the children coming from Indian culture, which further leads to bullying.

05:29:08.244 --> 05:29:13.689
The draft has excluded achievements like yoga, meditation, mathematical discoveries, and so on.

05:29:14.930 --> 05:29:20.616
It's the author's poor understanding of the achievements of India in ancient times or modern time like now.

05:29:21.437 --> 05:29:31.849
As a concerned parent, I strongly support other publishers like McGraw-Hill, Portrait, My Culture, and request the board to reject their social textbooks completely from California.

05:29:32.289 --> 05:29:32.570
Thank you.

05:29:38.835 --> 05:29:42.317
Good afternoon, members of the State Board of Education.

05:29:42.917 --> 05:29:52.541
I am Keshav, representing the Tri-Valley Talib community and also a parent of a child who has completed her education in the area I implemented these books.

05:29:53.221 --> 05:29:57.103
I remember those days other students questioning her reality and heritage.

05:29:57.383 --> 05:29:59.264
I find it imperative

05:30:00.319 --> 05:30:03.480
to bring the change to the narration of India and Hinduism.

05:30:03.820 --> 05:30:16.905
Indian culture presents many positive ideologies such as religious, harmony, instead of children who are taught non-relevant and negative ideologies and are given negative portrayal of India and Hinduism.

05:30:18.277 --> 05:30:28.947
I fully support IQC recommendations to change the content in the world and National Geography and Discovery Channel, Discovery textbooks.

05:30:30.108 --> 05:30:31.569
Yeah, please do the needful.

05:30:31.669 --> 05:30:31.970
Thank you.

05:30:40.563 --> 05:30:45.426
Respected members of SPE, next grader of Indian School District.

05:30:45.846 --> 05:30:53.911
So here I am today to speak against publishers like McGraw Hill and HMH who portray inaccurate Indian history and Hinduism.

05:30:54.351 --> 05:30:58.233
I request you to reject McGraw Hill and HMH programs.

05:30:58.654 --> 05:30:58.994
Thank you.

05:31:03.763 --> 05:31:07.447
A ferocious animosity has been unleashed against minorities in India.

05:31:08.088 --> 05:31:10.370
The caste system is a prison without walls.

05:31:11.091 --> 05:31:15.376
Just like my father spoke of Black Lives Matter, Dalit lives matter.

05:31:16.016 --> 05:31:18.019
These are the words of Martin Luther King Jr.

05:31:18.339 --> 05:31:23.204
III during an international conference the government of India invited me to attend last month.

05:31:24.225 --> 05:31:25.166
My name is Lama Rangdrol.

05:31:25.206 --> 05:31:27.748
I'm an African-American Buddhist Lama in the Tibetan tradition.

05:31:28.248 --> 05:31:36.153
And yes, Buddha was born into a privileged caste, but he left to found an indigenous casteless faith system.

05:31:38.475 --> 05:31:51.464
Therein lays the irrevocable distance difference between his religion and that I'm here to ask the SBE to join me in that compassion, as well as that of the king legacy as expressed last month.

05:31:53.208 --> 05:31:54.469
Join me in doing the right thing.

05:31:55.610 --> 05:31:58.293
Delay the vote and fix the text.

05:31:59.014 --> 05:31:59.294
Thank you.

05:32:03.083 --> 05:32:04.944
Good afternoon, members of the board.

05:32:05.264 --> 05:32:10.388
My name is Judy Appel, and I'm a trustee on the Berkeley Unified School District's Board of Education.

05:32:10.788 --> 05:32:23.677
And I'm speaking this afternoon in support of the IQC's recommendation and the Fair Education Act Implementation Coalition's recommendations for inclusion of LGBT materials.

05:32:24.477 --> 05:32:39.652
It's critical for our students that their history lessons fairly represent the cultural, ethnic, religious, sexual orientation, and gender diversity of our state, and that there is a full and accurate account of these communities in our textbooks.

05:32:40.333 --> 05:32:49.958
The teachers in my district have been waiting since the Fair Education Act for direction on what to teach and how to teach because they know that invisibility really harms our students.

05:32:50.378 --> 05:32:52.819
That's particularly true in this political environment.

05:32:53.139 --> 05:32:59.763
And so I will urge you to accept the recommendations of the IQC and the Fair Education Act Implementation Coalition.

05:32:59.803 --> 05:33:00.443
Thank you very much.

05:33:06.758 --> 05:33:09.461
My name is Harini, and I'm in seventh grade.

05:33:10.021 --> 05:33:14.386
India has many great things, such as music, culture, dance, festivals, and food.

05:33:14.786 --> 05:33:15.927
But why to choose the bad?

05:33:16.428 --> 05:33:23.375
I am proud to be from a student entity, and I request SBE not to support textbooks that tries to de-grenade that.

05:33:23.395 --> 05:33:25.537
Change these textbooks for the sake of our future.

05:33:30.990 --> 05:33:32.051
Hi, dear panel members.

05:33:32.431 --> 05:33:33.431
My name is Gagan Kashyap.

05:33:33.832 --> 05:33:35.393
I'm coming all the way from San Diego.

05:33:38.794 --> 05:33:46.719
My elder son, who is 12 years old, he always is very curious about our roots, and he and I always discuss quite often.

05:33:50.841 --> 05:34:03.095
He and he really very feel proud of it for Hinduism and it isn't actually basically is followed by about 1.15 billion people on earth Which prescribes the eternal duties such as honesty?

05:34:07.260 --> 05:34:11.825
They could self-restraint a compassion among others honesty and

05:34:13.306 --> 05:34:19.613
Again, these values are keeping us very proud of our religion.

05:34:20.674 --> 05:34:29.504
Having said that, when my son sees the Hinduism written in a textbook, he sees a very negative part of it, which really creates a big conflict in our house.

05:34:31.105 --> 05:34:41.208
We have a strong belief on this very great panel to really consider and fix this discrepancy.

05:34:41.228 --> 05:34:42.209
Thank you very much.

05:34:45.210 --> 05:34:45.650
Good evening.

05:34:45.930 --> 05:34:50.251
My name is Devi and I fully support IQC's decision to reject HMH K-6 and 6-8.

05:34:50.291 --> 05:34:50.711
Thank you.

05:34:55.762 --> 05:35:19.818
Hello, I'm Becca Kramer Mauter, and I'm here in my personal capacity as a Christian and a former United Methodist pastor, as well as in all capacity as a legislative coordinator of the ACLU of California, to encourage you to adopt and reject the textbooks that the Fair Education Act Implementation Coalition encourages you to adopt and to reject.

05:35:20.518 --> 05:35:32.433
so that all students in California can benefit from learning about California's diverse, pluralistic society, and so that LGBTQ students can see role models reflected in their curriculum.

05:35:32.613 --> 05:35:32.934
Thank you.

05:35:39.011 --> 05:35:43.516
Members of the board, I'm Rob Darrow, Director of Research at Safe Schools Project in Santa Cruz, California.

05:35:44.077 --> 05:35:48.742
I had the great fortune of meeting your student board member, Jayden Gray, at his high school.

05:35:48.982 --> 05:35:54.008
He and I together visited this elective course that's being offered at his school on LGBT history.

05:35:54.568 --> 05:35:58.332
It's one of about four or five schools in the state that offer a course like that.

05:35:59.033 --> 05:36:19.523
The students in the course shared why they thought it was important for students to learn about LGBT and their reasons included, it's important to learn history from different perspectives, it's important that LGBT people are highlighted in history because there's a lot of important LGBT people in history, and that overall it provides greater acceptance and understanding of all people.

05:36:20.003 --> 05:36:24.345
With your adoption of the IQC recommendations and the fair education, you will

05:36:24.545 --> 05:36:28.009
that process forward for all students throughout the state of California.

05:36:28.590 --> 05:36:30.832
Overall, you'll validate what those students said to me.

05:36:31.273 --> 05:36:36.239
It's important to study history from different perspectives so you can better understand yourself.

05:36:43.396 --> 05:36:43.976
Hello, everyone.

05:36:44.576 --> 05:36:45.477
My name is Vaishali.

05:36:46.317 --> 05:36:49.298
I belong to lower caste Bahujan Dalit community.

05:36:49.838 --> 05:36:54.380
I stand here to oppose Hindu phobia by a group called S-A-H-F-A.

05:36:55.180 --> 05:37:02.142
I belong to ancestry of Savitribai Phule, who fought for reforms of all women, Dalit and non-Dalit alike.

05:37:02.862 --> 05:37:05.903
I don't want to feel they are nobodies, but only victims.

05:37:06.463 --> 05:37:10.925
But I want them to know their ancestors were great contributors to Hindu culture.

05:37:11.705 --> 05:37:15.828
I want my children to remain secure in their Hindu religious beliefs.

05:37:16.588 --> 05:37:24.794
Some people like SAHFA think that California's history textbooks can be used to generate hate and convert kids into Hindu religion.

05:37:25.494 --> 05:37:26.575
This is disgusting.

05:37:27.376 --> 05:37:36.381
Fringe elements of SAHFA may try and continue to propagate hate into other places, but not in my state.

05:37:36.602 --> 05:37:36.942
Thank you.

05:37:45.785 --> 05:37:46.686
Good afternoon, everyone.

05:37:46.826 --> 05:37:54.096
My name is Sumedha, and I'm from the caste that some people consider it's a lower caste community.

05:37:54.657 --> 05:37:57.781
I stand here against any kind of Hindu phobia.

05:37:57.921 --> 05:38:04.249
Countless saints from Dalit and Bahujan Samaj community have contributed to Indian society.

05:38:05.070 --> 05:38:14.382
For example, Satvamali composed a melodious poem and divinity is within everything, even within plants and animals.

05:38:14.523 --> 05:38:20.731
But some people right here in this room ask to remove the lower caste sons to be removed from the framework.

05:38:21.155 --> 05:38:32.346
Do you know who these people, they were S-A-H-F-A, the very same people who claim to stand for me and my community.

05:38:33.047 --> 05:38:37.131
Sorry, Safa, you don't stand for me, you only stand for hate.

05:38:37.431 --> 05:38:42.757
And thank you to IQC and SBE for including these saints in California.

05:38:42.777 --> 05:38:43.517
Thank you.

05:38:49.714 --> 05:38:53.675
Respected members of SBE, my name is Nambi Sankaran.

05:38:54.015 --> 05:38:56.375
I've been living in Bay Area for 20 years.

05:38:57.156 --> 05:38:59.156
And I have a daughter who is in the third grade.

05:39:00.016 --> 05:39:05.037
I'm shocked to see the American textbooks still prematerial.

05:39:05.177 --> 05:39:07.258
This results in students being bullied.

05:39:07.318 --> 05:39:11.118
Even the teachers could bully the kids or insult them in front of everyone.

05:39:11.779 --> 05:39:12.999
I don't want this to happen.

05:39:13.359 --> 05:39:17.040
So we must condemn bullying at all levels, including schools.

05:39:17.160 --> 05:39:18.460
Actually, schools are more important.

05:39:19.461 --> 05:39:23.405
It is our duty as responsible citizens to stop bullying.

05:39:23.425 --> 05:39:28.330
So please reject textbooks like HMH and National Geographic.

05:39:29.011 --> 05:39:33.856
And let's stop the racial textbooks being used for bullying.

05:39:34.057 --> 05:39:34.277
Thank you.

05:39:39.028 --> 05:39:41.331
Honorable Board, my name is Gaurav Verma.

05:39:41.471 --> 05:39:44.654
I'm from Fremont.

05:39:45.295 --> 05:39:56.207
And I'm here because I'm concerned about her future as a Hindu child because I want her to grow up with a lot of self-respect about her culture and identity.

05:39:56.907 --> 05:40:03.289
So I do welcome IQC's recommendation to reject Mifflin's, Harcourt's, K-6 and 6-2-8 texts.

05:40:04.149 --> 05:40:10.712
But I will say that the draft textbook by McGraw-Hill for 6th grade does ignore the history-social-science framework for 2016.

05:40:11.932 --> 05:40:17.674
Specifically, I would say that the non-authoritative translation of important texts like Bhagavad Gita by McGraw and Discovery

05:40:18.414 --> 05:40:22.135
will have an adverse effect on the psychology and self-respect of Hindu children.

05:40:23.095 --> 05:40:29.637
And these sacred texts, one must have acquired the knowledge in a bona fide disciplic succession under a guru.

05:40:29.897 --> 05:40:35.158
So I do strongly move to adopt the translation from AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada for chapter 6 and 8.

05:40:36.338 --> 05:40:38.779
Edwin Arnold was clearly not qualified

05:40:39.423 --> 05:40:40.743
as he was a poet and journalist.

05:40:41.704 --> 05:40:47.665
On the other hand, I've been asked to announce that we have heard from, we believe, 283 speakers.

05:40:47.745 --> 05:40:48.065
Thank you.

05:41:01.408 --> 05:41:02.008
Good afternoon.

05:41:02.529 --> 05:41:02.809
Thank you.

05:41:02.829 --> 05:41:06.191
As your 200th speaker, I appreciate your attention and patience.

05:41:06.892 --> 05:41:08.172
My name is Natasha Sani.

05:41:08.332 --> 05:41:11.074
I'm a partner with the law firm of Garcia Hernandez and Sani.

05:41:11.114 --> 05:41:13.576
We represent school districts throughout the state.

05:41:13.616 --> 05:41:20.460
I serve as general counsel to a number of school districts, including the Oxnard School District, Wainimi, Peralta Community College District, and a number of others.

05:41:21.821 --> 05:41:32.391
I also served as the speaker's appointee to the California Commission on Asian Pacific Islander Affairs, and I stand here before you as a Sikh American and soon-to-be parent of a public school child.

05:41:33.412 --> 05:41:44.904
You have received a letter from the Shergill Law Firm outlining a number of issues and mistakes that we see in the text that's been provided and asked for adoption and consideration.

05:41:45.544 --> 05:42:00.073
We're requesting that the Instructional Quality Commission's curriculum framework that was adopted by this board on July 14, 2016, be complied with more fully, more accurately.

05:42:00.454 --> 05:42:05.537
We know that these issues are complicated and tough and we need your continued attention to these.

05:42:06.438 --> 05:42:08.619
History matters, accurate history matters.

05:42:09.039 --> 05:42:11.701
Please enforce that framework and fix these issues.

05:42:11.841 --> 05:42:14.643
We hope not to need to bring an injunction or any other further

05:42:15.063 --> 05:42:17.869
legal action and we really appreciate your attention.

05:42:17.929 --> 05:42:18.330
Thank you.

05:42:21.776 --> 05:42:26.966
If you have a number up number 350 please line up in the lobby.

05:42:32.951 --> 05:42:36.993
Hi, I know everyone here must be exhausted and we all appreciate your service.

05:42:37.453 --> 05:42:39.354
Just to give you a heads up, you're not missing much out there.

05:42:39.695 --> 05:42:41.996
It's raining and the line out there looks like the DMV.

05:42:44.557 --> 05:42:46.198
I'm an emergency medicine physician.

05:42:46.218 --> 05:42:47.899
I'm here for South Asian Histories for All.

05:42:48.719 --> 05:42:53.822
As an emergency medicine physician, I've seen the implications of conveniently deleting facts from research.

05:42:54.542 --> 05:43:03.847
Dr. Andrew Wakefield, for personal financial gain, erased data on the studies leading to the anti-vaxxer move in the 90s.

05:43:04.548 --> 05:43:10.271
And now we see the implications of that among the pertussis victims, children who can't breathe.

05:43:10.951 --> 05:43:19.734
There's the Tuskegee syphilis study, where you have African-American population that was inoculated with syphilis for research purposes.

05:43:19.834 --> 05:43:26.496
And in Detroit, for example, where I trained, you have American public that doesn't trust the medical community.

05:43:27.556 --> 05:43:32.037
Time and time again, we see the sequelae of alternative facts, of deletions of history.

05:43:32.457 --> 05:43:37.759
And I please urge you to enforce the framework and fix the facts.

05:43:37.999 --> 05:43:38.259
Thank you.

05:43:44.482 --> 05:43:51.909
Hello, my name is Sarah Jean Zochline, and I am a seventh grade teacher in the state of California.

05:43:51.929 --> 05:43:57.894
And I just want to let you know that if this textbook is published, I will not teach it to my students.

05:43:59.215 --> 05:43:59.936
Thank you very much.

05:44:05.253 --> 05:44:05.933
Good afternoon.

05:44:06.613 --> 05:44:08.854
IQC, I'm sorry, introduce myself.

05:44:08.974 --> 05:44:10.795
Lorraine Richards, I'm so anxious to be up here.

05:44:10.815 --> 05:44:13.096
I've been waiting since nine o'clock.

05:44:14.496 --> 05:44:16.997
Lorraine Richards, California Teachers Association.

05:44:17.737 --> 05:44:20.198
IQC spent much time on a massive task.

05:44:20.598 --> 05:44:22.118
Much review has been involved.

05:44:22.479 --> 05:44:26.740
As a social studies, it has been very frustrating to implement Common Core this year.

05:44:26.760 --> 05:44:32.242
The English department had the luxury of having a textbook and having primary sources

05:44:33.562 --> 05:44:35.025
to implement Common Core.

05:44:36.287 --> 05:44:40.974
And this year, the social studies teacher in my department are still using the 2006 textbook.

05:44:45.166 --> 05:44:46.967
187 and George W. Bush as president.

05:44:47.467 --> 05:44:53.530
Teachers continue to hunt for dated material that's appropriate online and photocopying is necessary.

05:44:54.550 --> 05:45:00.733
The PLCs have to take a shift and look for the materials in tune and effectively use them in the classroom.

05:45:01.414 --> 05:45:06.636
But you also need to consider equity taken into consideration and state in the California Education Code.

05:45:06.716 --> 05:45:06.976
Thank you.

05:45:10.250 --> 05:45:11.991
Hey everyone, my name's Tara.

05:45:12.391 --> 05:45:15.433
I'm a queer transgender Hindu born into an upper caste family.

05:45:16.033 --> 05:45:18.095
I'm here with the South Asian Histories for All Coalition.

05:45:18.895 --> 05:45:23.718
I believe it's incredibly important that folks like me learn the truth about caste and its root culture.

05:45:24.418 --> 05:45:26.940
We can't end caste apartheid if we can't talk about it.

05:45:27.964 --> 05:45:35.388
Learning basic historically accurate facts isn't an attack on Hinduism, just like learning about homophobia isn't an attack on straight people.

05:45:36.189 --> 05:45:42.112
It's a form of educational malpractice when Hindu nationalists flatten our communities or dumb us down to a single narrative.

05:45:43.153 --> 05:45:44.974
And fourth, thank you.

05:45:49.619 --> 05:45:50.300
Good afternoon.

05:45:50.420 --> 05:45:51.262
As-salamu alaykum.

05:45:51.342 --> 05:45:52.163
Peace be upon you.

05:45:52.384 --> 05:45:53.565
My name is Farah Mahasri.

05:45:53.726 --> 05:45:54.868
I'm a Muslim American.

05:45:55.288 --> 05:45:58.213
My parents are from the South Asian country of Pakistan.

05:45:58.814 --> 05:46:04.063
I'm here today to ask you to enforce your framework and to fix the facts and some of the proposals.

05:46:05.356 --> 05:46:12.359
Today, 53% of students, Muslim students in the great state of California, report being bullied in school.

05:46:12.379 --> 05:46:20.441
36% of Muslim girls who wear hijabs or head coverings report that their hijabs have been forcefully removed from their heads.

05:46:20.782 --> 05:46:22.102
That is a physical assault.

05:46:22.622 --> 05:46:29.785
When we allow Isiah into our textbook, it institutionalizes fear and hatred and bigotry against Muslims.

05:46:30.779 --> 05:46:32.340
And this has long-lasting effects.

05:46:32.900 --> 05:46:37.202
As educators, we know that students who are traumatized are incapable of learning.

05:46:37.602 --> 05:46:41.744
They are stuck in fight-or-flight response, and they cannot retain long-term memory.

05:46:41.764 --> 05:46:45.145
I know that this is a fact from personal experience.

05:46:45.565 --> 05:46:50.748
As a 10-year-old, my teacher, my teacher called me a terrorist in front of our entire classroom.

05:46:51.108 --> 05:46:53.349
So thank you, and I ask you to enforce your framework.

05:46:57.912 --> 05:46:59.774
Hello, I'm Kamal.

05:46:59.974 --> 05:47:03.718
I'm a Fremont resident.

05:47:04.499 --> 05:47:15.730
I support Professor Jeffrey Long's and Hindupedia's recommendation to edit some of the text.

05:47:16.231 --> 05:47:18.113
I feel every religion should be

05:47:19.102 --> 05:47:41.265
represented correctly and it will only you know through an authority i support chapter six and chapter eight of ac bhakti vedanta uh bhagavad gita's text to be included in the megahill text

05:47:42.686 --> 05:47:49.190
books current text is not accurately representing Hinduism.

05:47:49.991 --> 05:47:50.251
Thanks.

05:47:54.074 --> 05:48:00.738
Hello, my name is Abhinav Shukla and I'm a Hindi poet and I really appreciate all the effort you have been putting in.

05:48:01.503 --> 05:48:07.528
I support IQC and doctor's feedback that we have been talking about.

05:48:07.548 --> 05:48:16.755
I just want to tell you that I'm father of two kids, and I want them to be the wonderful citizen of the future of America.

05:48:17.255 --> 05:48:23.520
And I want them to feel from inside, not anything that puts them

05:48:33.141 --> 05:48:38.692
I am a parent of a 10th grader and a 4th grader studying in Balsam Cordova School District.

05:48:39.473 --> 05:48:43.401
California state guidelines for India, Hinduism and Jainism be ignored.

05:48:48.442 --> 05:48:55.245
only if they incorporate the content suggested by Professor Geoffrey Long and other 38 academics.

05:48:55.785 --> 05:48:59.407
And if we don't reject these draft books, those are in question.

05:48:59.747 --> 05:49:04.829
Eventually, they will increase in bullying incidents against our students.

05:49:06.089 --> 05:49:08.070
will say, look at California, what have you done?

05:49:08.090 --> 05:49:14.733
And eventually other states who are adopting California history books, you know, they may stop, you know, adopting California history books.

05:49:15.373 --> 05:49:22.316
I appeal again, please stop material disrespecting and misrepresenting Hindus and Jain people in the California textbooks.

05:49:22.736 --> 05:49:32.419
California is at the top of my economy list in the world, and please maintain the same standards while representing Hinduism and Jainism.

05:49:32.459 --> 05:49:32.760
Thank you.

05:49:32.880 --> 05:49:33.580
Thank you very much.

05:49:36.377 --> 05:49:37.078
Good afternoon.

05:49:37.498 --> 05:49:43.625
I'm a parent of a first-generation born who's going to put his roots here in California and the United States.

05:49:44.720 --> 05:49:47.522
Thank you for your hard work, for listening to all of us.

05:49:48.402 --> 05:49:59.769
California law and the standards standard of evaluation says the criteria is to instill in each child a sense of pride in his or her heritage.

05:50:00.429 --> 05:50:04.392
Develop a feeling of self worth related to equality of opportunity.

05:50:05.072 --> 05:50:11.376
Eradicate the roots of prejudice and thereby encourage the optimal individual development.

05:50:12.316 --> 05:50:18.281
All of these are violated by textbooks by HMK and others.

05:50:18.361 --> 05:50:29.651
They also prohibit any description, depiction, label, or rejoinder that tend to demean, stereotype, or patronize minority groups.

05:50:30.451 --> 05:50:34.214
The portrayal of Hindu religion does exactly that.

05:50:35.493 --> 05:50:43.520
Malcolm X said, if you hate your roots, then you cannot like any other part of your trip.

05:50:43.921 --> 05:50:46.463
This is exactly what the textbooks do.

05:50:47.985 --> 05:50:53.349
Thank you so much, and I hope you do hear us out and make a good decision.

05:50:53.590 --> 05:50:53.930
Thank you.

05:51:10.117 --> 05:51:10.524
That's it.

05:51:14.622 --> 05:51:15.903
Hello, my name is Eric Harris.

05:51:16.023 --> 05:51:17.904
I'm with the California NAACP.

05:51:19.045 --> 05:51:30.472
I'm here because an organization, NAACP, as a racial minority, we understand the challenges that are faced when it comes to our story being told properly.

05:51:31.612 --> 05:51:42.879
We understand, as an organization that has been around since 1909, that it is very, very important to have textbooks and have history written the way that it's supposed to be written.

05:51:44.463 --> 05:51:51.565
We started, like I said, in 1909, and we've been an organization for generations representing different people of color.

05:51:52.885 --> 05:52:08.509
And we stand up strong for the people of Indian descent when it comes to these textbooks, saying that they should be done properly, redone, and that the current textbooks are not in the proper form.

05:52:09.609 --> 05:52:15.232
the California NAACP stands against the current textbooks in their current form.

05:52:15.333 --> 05:52:15.673
Thank you.

05:52:36.805 --> 05:52:37.305
Namaste.

05:52:37.525 --> 05:52:38.366
My name is Govinda.

05:52:39.332 --> 05:52:40.854
I am Tracy, California.

05:52:42.115 --> 05:52:51.805
These are the opening marks in a language called Sanskrit, the most ancient language from India.

05:52:52.506 --> 05:52:58.352
Anything to know about India, you need to know Sanskrit, whether it is the culture, whether the Vedas.

05:52:58.973 --> 05:53:09.702
Bhagavad Gita they're talking about, all the contributions that ancient in technology, science, mathematics, and everything, they're all in Sanskrit.

05:53:10.522 --> 05:53:11.723
Sanskrit is alive today.

05:53:12.224 --> 05:53:16.747
And in fact, here in Bay Area, hundreds of people speak Sanskrit at home.

05:53:17.208 --> 05:53:21.912
But many of the textbooks that are being prepared, they do not say anything about Sanskrit.

05:53:22.252 --> 05:53:25.855
They talk about Sanskrit, but in a way that is no longer spoken by people.

05:53:26.647 --> 05:53:27.048
I spoke.

05:53:27.248 --> 05:53:27.708
I'm alive.

05:53:27.969 --> 05:53:29.050
So Sanskrit is also alive.

05:53:29.591 --> 05:53:30.912
In fact, my son is here.

05:53:30.952 --> 05:53:32.094
He speaks Sanskrit.

05:53:32.114 --> 05:53:33.375
We speak Sanskrit at home.

05:53:33.916 --> 05:53:35.859
So thousands of people speak Sanskrit at home.

05:53:36.339 --> 05:53:42.807
Not only that, the textbook that we also support all the changes that are being done.

05:53:42.907 --> 05:53:43.909
Professor, thank you.

05:53:48.857 --> 05:53:50.118
Hi, esteemed board members.

05:53:50.599 --> 05:53:53.101
My name is Sirisha and I'm from Folsom, California.

05:53:53.121 --> 05:53:59.547
I thank and fully support the decision of IQC to reject the two programs of HMH.

05:54:00.127 --> 05:54:05.472
These programs affect our kids very negatively by portraying them and their country in a very negative light.

05:54:05.933 --> 05:54:13.400
Even after the huge number of revisions and rewrites submitted at the last minute, not all problems are being addressed equitably.

05:54:14.720 --> 05:54:22.632
HMH had to submit 4,600 edicts collectively for their program, that too just four days ahead of IQC's deadlines.

05:54:23.233 --> 05:54:26.117
Even with that, they have huge errors in their books.

05:54:27.148 --> 05:54:33.474
For example, just the HMH 628 program has more than 160 revisions.

05:54:34.174 --> 05:54:41.921
Since they are not permitted as per California Code Regulation, Section 9524A5.

05:54:42.862 --> 05:54:47.666
Even this has several errors and we don't have time to go through all of them.

05:54:48.187 --> 05:54:50.669
Just a cursory review shows a lot of problems for them.

05:54:51.009 --> 05:54:53.091
So please reject HMH books.

05:54:53.431 --> 05:54:53.812
Thank you.

05:54:58.911 --> 05:55:00.352
Good evening board members.

05:55:00.452 --> 05:55:01.552
Thank you for listening to us.

05:55:02.032 --> 05:55:03.353
My name is Sarjanya Palleti.

05:55:03.413 --> 05:55:06.454
I live in San Jose and my two kids go to Evergreen School District.

05:55:07.114 --> 05:55:17.278
As a first generation Hindu American parent it has become a challenge for me to make my kids unlearn and undo what is taught in the schools and school textbooks which is very sad.

05:55:17.738 --> 05:55:19.919
Especially with respect to my culture and religion.

05:55:20.479 --> 05:55:23.761
I'm appalled to see Hindu Hinduphobic and anti-Hindu group.

05:55:24.501 --> 05:55:26.962
Against Hindus and contempt towards anything Hindu.

05:55:27.990 --> 05:55:41.875
It is imperative that you reject untruthful, biased, and hateful material against Hindus and present Hinduism and Indian civilization the same way and with same standards and with all fairness that you present the other religions.

05:55:42.615 --> 05:55:45.837
Now, onus is on Brexit, which is long overdue.

05:55:46.177 --> 05:55:46.717
Thank you very much.

05:56:05.646 --> 05:56:07.448
I am on behalf of all these eight kids.

05:56:08.049 --> 05:56:10.512
So we support the IQC recommendation.

05:56:10.973 --> 05:56:12.735
We support Jeffrey Long's letter.

05:56:13.215 --> 05:56:15.618
And we oppose Hinduphobic groups like SAFA.

05:56:16.079 --> 05:56:16.659
So thank you.

05:56:16.980 --> 05:56:18.421
We just wanted to come as a group.

05:56:18.522 --> 05:56:18.722
Thanks.

05:56:31.869 --> 05:56:35.451
respected members of State Board of Education, a big Namaste and Om to all.

05:56:35.471 --> 05:56:41.774
I'm Chakravarti Sulwa from Milpitas, California, representing Virat Hindustan Sangam, California chapter.

05:56:42.454 --> 05:56:46.556
Before coming here, monetization of Hindus and Indians.

05:56:47.336 --> 05:56:55.740
But I really felt bad after listening to a lady just before, who mentioned that a guy was beaten up for growing mustache.

05:56:56.401 --> 05:56:59.322
But I think she probably forgot that a Sikh

05:57:00.046 --> 05:57:03.791
with a beard, mustache, and turban for a decade.

05:57:04.652 --> 05:57:09.117
Senator board members, lots of fake information is being projected by different groups.

05:57:09.418 --> 05:57:15.905
So I humbly request you to all please consider feedback given by Hindus, not Hinduators.

05:57:16.306 --> 05:57:16.907
Thank you so much.

05:57:25.743 --> 05:57:31.364
It is a well-known fact that bias and ignorance stems from miseducation.

05:57:32.064 --> 05:57:38.726
A simple solution to this ignorance is to fix the textbooks that millions of kids in California read, but not everyone agrees with the solution.

05:57:39.766 --> 05:57:44.808
The people of SAFA has interrupted the process at the last minute and are now bold to make changes and stop the process.

05:57:46.088 --> 05:57:50.130
One of the lady speakers representing SAFA came up to me while I was in line and started recording me.

05:57:50.910 --> 05:57:55.973
When I asked her why she was recording, she harassingly asked, do you believe hatred against Dallas is funny?

05:57:56.813 --> 05:57:56.953
No.

05:57:57.233 --> 05:57:59.074
Discrimination against anyone is never funny.

05:57:59.534 --> 05:58:03.416
This is coming from someone who has been discriminated and abused for my religion and my belief.

05:58:03.456 --> 05:58:06.698
No matter who you are, you deserve the same amount of respect you give to others.

05:58:07.758 --> 05:58:10.720
I request for you to accept the revisions admitted by the IQC.

05:58:11.000 --> 05:58:11.240
Thank you.

05:58:15.570 --> 05:58:18.871
Good afternoon, respected member of SBE.

05:58:19.371 --> 05:58:20.372
My name is Basavaraj.

05:58:20.412 --> 05:58:21.852
I'm a resident of Pleasanton.

05:58:21.872 --> 05:58:24.153
I have two kids going to Clinton University.

05:58:25.253 --> 05:58:32.296
I'm here to support IQC's decision about rejecting HMH K-6 and 6-8.

05:58:32.736 --> 05:58:35.357
And also I support Jeffrey Long's letter.

05:58:36.037 --> 05:58:39.578
And thank you very much for listening and your hard work.

05:58:39.598 --> 05:58:40.799
I appreciate your time.

05:58:41.039 --> 05:58:41.499
Have a good day.

05:58:48.817 --> 05:58:51.938
respected members, I am Nilesh Malpedi.

05:58:52.278 --> 05:58:57.079
First of all, I really appreciate your patience listening all of us.

05:58:58.619 --> 05:59:08.462
Without taking any additional time, I thank you, fully support the decision of IQC rejecting the and then I support by Jeffrey Long and 38 other academicians.

05:59:08.802 --> 05:59:09.062
Thank you.

05:59:15.020 --> 05:59:23.287
Dear board members, how would you react if New York is shown in books with the pictures of homeless people at ghettos instead of Statue of Liberty?

05:59:24.728 --> 05:59:30.913
India and Indian civilization has offered many things, such as yoga, mathematics, and the democracy.

05:59:31.333 --> 05:59:34.416
So why show India in poor light by showing slums and monkeys?

05:59:35.136 --> 05:59:39.420
My name is Ramji Sethuraman, father of two kids who are studying in San Mateo School District.

05:59:40.100 --> 05:59:50.487
I would like to register my disappointment in front of the members of the State Board regarding the misrepresentation of India and Hinduism in the HMH K-6 and HMH 6-8 programs.

05:59:51.087 --> 05:59:55.850
I fully support the decision of IQC to reject these two programs of HMH.

05:59:56.250 --> 06:00:03.454
I stand here with the support of 11 Assembly members, 3 Congressmen, 3 Senators, Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, and numerous Hindu Jainists.

06:00:04.735 --> 06:00:06.176
Stop the hatred against Hindus.

06:00:06.596 --> 06:00:07.917
Stop demonization of Hindus.

06:00:08.418 --> 06:00:13.361
I trust the board will hear our plea and reject HMS2 programs as recommended by IQC.

06:00:13.641 --> 06:00:13.961
Thank you.

06:00:19.364 --> 06:00:22.906
Namaste, respected members of State Board of Education.

06:00:24.884 --> 06:00:27.605
originally a Kashmiri Pandit refugee from India.

06:00:28.365 --> 06:00:30.506
I missed my birthday today to make myself heard.

06:00:31.266 --> 06:00:38.028
My elder daughter's social science studies classroom experience was very painful for us and has left very bad memories for our family.

06:00:38.928 --> 06:00:41.489
I have been hoping for better books for my younger daughter.

06:00:42.289 --> 06:00:49.011
I fully support the Recommended QC and digital textbooks of HMH, but I would like you to do more to fix the problems.

06:00:49.791 --> 06:00:52.995
McGraw-Hill also has a lot of prejudiced and racist content.

06:00:53.776 --> 06:01:02.587
I also demand that all the recommendations of the academic coalition by Professor Geoffrey Long and 38 other top academics be accepted.

06:01:03.088 --> 06:01:07.033
If the person has suggested correction, please reject McGraw-Hill as well.

06:01:07.273 --> 06:01:08.134
Thank you and Dhanyavad.

06:01:14.235 --> 06:01:21.142
Hello everyone namaste my name is Veda Balapalli and I'm a 6th grader at Madea Creek Middle School in Oak Park California.

06:01:22.023 --> 06:01:24.506
6th grade was the first time I was taught my culture in school.

06:01:25.046 --> 06:01:30.271
I was very excited however I'm so shocked by the way how my culture is described.

06:01:30.772 --> 06:01:34.916
It is not fair that the textbook is creating the negative impression upon us.

06:01:35.917 --> 06:01:46.326
After reading the chapter, I clearly feel that not only will my classmates form wrong impressions on Hindu culture, but I also feel that my fellow Hindus may be bullied for the same reason.

06:01:46.966 --> 06:01:55.333
Surprisingly, the textbooks do not cover the many positive aspects of my culture, such as dance, music, culture, festivals, traditions, philosophy, et cetera.

06:01:56.134 --> 06:02:00.157
I understand, as for my dad, that IQC did an excellent job in framework.

06:02:00.738 --> 06:02:04.121
I sincerely request you to make sure that the framework standards.

06:02:04.821 --> 06:02:08.086
Good textbooks encourage student interaction and stop bullying.

06:02:08.607 --> 06:02:15.177
By following the framework standards you will be promoting that for my future, my siblings future and other children's future as well.

06:02:15.518 --> 06:02:16.259
Thank you very much.

06:02:16.279 --> 06:02:16.640
Thank you.

06:02:21.124 --> 06:02:21.664
Good afternoon.

06:02:21.704 --> 06:02:22.905
My name is Jaddeep Singh.

06:02:22.945 --> 06:02:26.926
I've appeared before at least a couple of times in my capacity as a Sikh-American historian.

06:02:27.947 --> 06:02:29.788
I'm someone who's very deeply invested.

06:02:30.748 --> 06:02:35.350
I held one of the four Sikh studies chairs in the state of California about five, six years ago.

06:02:35.810 --> 06:02:36.891
So that's part of my credentials.

06:02:36.911 --> 06:02:42.813
I appeared before you before here because Sikh-American history was being distorted and erased.

06:02:43.133 --> 06:02:44.154
And I paid no respect.

06:02:44.674 --> 06:02:52.900
Unfortunately, there are still some problems in terms of theology, of Sikh Americans being misrepresented, Islamophobic histories, as well as misrepresentations of caste.

06:02:53.660 --> 06:02:56.562
Now, I'm someone who's very deeply invested in California's education.

06:02:56.582 --> 06:02:59.244
Not only did I go to high school here, but I earned three degrees from here.

06:02:59.264 --> 06:03:01.366
I've taught in all three levels of higher education.

06:03:02.066 --> 06:03:08.390
Now the problem we have in this country, the reason we have Nazis marching in Charlottesville is because the lack of courage we had in telling the truth about who we are.

06:03:08.770 --> 06:03:10.171
The same problem is occurring right here.

06:03:10.571 --> 06:03:14.534
Yes, our history with caste is very ugly, but that doesn't mean we should erase it.

06:03:15.654 --> 06:03:20.317
So please, listen to the historians, South Asian American Histories for All, listen to the scholars.

06:03:20.517 --> 06:03:23.499
I'm a scholar and I know that I'm not qualified to make these adjudications.

06:03:23.519 --> 06:03:24.439
Please listen to the scholars that are.

06:03:24.619 --> 06:03:24.940
Thank you.

06:03:30.276 --> 06:03:32.077
Namaste, respected SBE members.

06:03:32.937 --> 06:03:33.477
I am Kiran.

06:03:33.877 --> 06:03:39.619
I'm a parent of a seventh grader son and a first grader in Cupertino, California.

06:03:41.380 --> 06:03:46.062
Quickly, my major concerns are the reflection of Hinduism.

06:03:47.322 --> 06:03:54.552
My son and myself have been reviewing the drafts as well and I involved him for the sake of understanding.

06:03:55.173 --> 06:03:58.777
So my experience comes right out of what I saw my son said.

06:03:59.639 --> 06:04:03.364
He did feel that Hinduism has been negatively reflected.

06:04:04.785 --> 06:04:13.635
He doesn't feel that it would reflect his character or what he thinks about others regarding caste or any many other aspects.

06:04:14.096 --> 06:04:18.481
So my request to you is, please continue to reject HMH.

06:04:19.282 --> 06:04:21.765
I support the IQC decision to reject HMH.

06:04:22.185 --> 06:04:24.208
And at the same time, please reject me.

06:04:25.649 --> 06:04:31.380
Please consider the changes for Nat Geo and also consider Jeffrey Long's letter.

06:04:31.801 --> 06:04:36.991
So the biggest concern is the credibility of the textbooks so that the kids start respecting the textbooks.

06:04:37.071 --> 06:04:37.292
Thank you.

06:04:40.646 --> 06:04:41.988
Good afternoon and namaste.

06:04:42.889 --> 06:04:47.114
I know you have something to learn for the future generations to come.

06:04:47.775 --> 06:04:53.482
So I hope and I urge you to make a decision based on unity and not divinity.

06:04:53.802 --> 06:04:55.545
So let's not divide, let's unite.

06:04:56.486 --> 06:05:00.429
And these are the children who will be going and becoming future presidents and senators.

06:05:00.830 --> 06:05:02.411
They have to be proud of who they are.

06:05:02.431 --> 06:05:08.698
The country and its social and economical situations are different than a religion.

06:05:08.838 --> 06:05:11.140
Religion is practiced by many people all over the world.

06:05:11.520 --> 06:05:17.486
I hope and I'm sure that we'll make the right decision that we can be proud of 10 years from now or maybe 100 years from now.

06:05:17.706 --> 06:05:18.027
Thank you.

06:05:21.437 --> 06:05:36.928
Good afternoon, my name is Navdeep and I've taken today off and drove all the way from San Diego to share my concerns about negative portrayal of Hinduism and India in HMH McGraw-Hill and Discovery books.

06:05:38.098 --> 06:05:46.124
I was born and raised in India and I have experienced beautiful aspects of Hinduism like there is a world as one family.

06:05:46.925 --> 06:05:51.989
Also respect for women, inherent secularism and love for environment.

06:05:52.829 --> 06:05:57.493
I have many friends whose children were bullied in school because of negative portrayal of Hinduism.

06:05:58.454 --> 06:06:03.377
This is not just against California Department of Education's guidelines but also against

06:06:04.747 --> 06:06:07.828
Please reject HMH as recommended by IQC.

06:06:08.329 --> 06:06:15.292
And also, I fully support edits submitted by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other academics.

06:06:15.512 --> 06:06:16.252
Thank you very much.

06:06:20.634 --> 06:06:21.154
Namaste.

06:06:21.274 --> 06:06:22.194
Good afternoon, everyone.

06:06:23.115 --> 06:06:27.937
I am the fourth grader and one son coming from Los Angeles.

06:06:29.491 --> 06:06:31.594
I'm coming from a Hindu background.

06:06:32.114 --> 06:06:35.418
We respect, we treat women as goddesses.

06:06:35.478 --> 06:06:36.619
We have goddesses, Lakshmi.

06:06:36.940 --> 06:06:38.161
We have goddesses, Saraswati.

06:06:38.702 --> 06:06:41.685
We have goddesses, you know, for education.

06:06:42.246 --> 06:06:46.170
We consider men, consider teachers of God.

06:06:46.371 --> 06:06:47.792
We see everywhere God.

06:06:48.613 --> 06:06:50.734
You know, we wanted to include everyone.

06:06:51.794 --> 06:07:01.318
So I would request we should not promote any negativism or any, you know, making any other religion or anything bad.

06:07:02.358 --> 06:07:08.600
We are sending our support and we have to have that inclusive attitude.

06:07:08.780 --> 06:07:10.261
We should not separate anyone.

06:07:11.514 --> 06:07:17.981
So I really appreciate your patience, you know, having you have that type of intention, you're patiently listening.

06:07:18.422 --> 06:07:20.364
I really appreciate your patience.

06:07:21.084 --> 06:07:22.946
I'm thankful to you.

06:07:23.507 --> 06:07:29.213
Strongly support the introduction of the hedge fund by IQC and request you to confirm.

06:07:29.634 --> 06:07:30.294
Thank you very much.

06:07:30.474 --> 06:07:30.815
Dhanyavaad.

06:07:35.342 --> 06:07:35.883
Hello, everybody.

06:07:37.003 --> 06:07:38.265
Thanks for all your patience.

06:07:40.106 --> 06:07:43.229
I'm coming from Fremont School District.

06:07:45.391 --> 06:07:47.693
And of course, the first generation daughters in America.

06:07:48.453 --> 06:07:54.899
And I'm also, as a parent, deeply concerned the way I read her chapter on Hinduism.

06:07:55.159 --> 06:07:59.382
And it start with first paragraph, which is full of negativity.

06:08:00.183 --> 06:08:00.983
about casteism.

06:08:01.824 --> 06:08:02.484
I'm not surprised.

06:08:02.524 --> 06:08:08.307
I mean, if you want to focus, you should focus on positive things about any religion, any country.

06:08:09.867 --> 06:08:15.210
And today, millions of people around the world, and in America as well, following the yoga.

06:08:16.871 --> 06:08:18.511
Because everybody's looking for peace.

06:08:19.812 --> 06:08:25.314
And within themselves, also, you know what's happening around the world.

06:08:26.195 --> 06:08:28.736
And this yoga came from India.

06:08:29.591 --> 06:08:34.093
And you are not projecting that as a positive thing in the book.

06:08:35.074 --> 06:08:35.994
That should be our clients.

06:08:36.494 --> 06:08:41.897
If you love American kids, America, and our next generation, you should focus on positive thing.

06:08:42.717 --> 06:08:44.938
So I support HMS books.

06:08:45.419 --> 06:08:46.999
Thank you.

06:08:47.400 --> 06:08:47.900
Thank you, sir.

06:08:53.271 --> 06:08:53.571
Hello.

06:08:54.712 --> 06:08:56.334
Hello, my name is Shyam Paleti.

06:08:56.754 --> 06:08:57.755
I'm from San Jose.

06:08:58.355 --> 06:09:05.862
Recently, a news article from LA Times caught my attention that one of the princes of South Korea was arrested for corruption charges.

06:09:06.202 --> 06:09:13.308
He was the donor to the tune of $20 million to the Harvard and George Washington universities.

06:09:13.808 --> 06:09:19.273
You see, such corruption happens to be donating to the universities and academic

06:09:20.908 --> 06:09:24.611
institutions so that they can present their religion.

06:09:25.652 --> 06:09:34.679
Such Islamic or evangelical missionaries, marxist groups, are big donors to present their angelic view of that one.

06:09:35.079 --> 06:09:44.166
That is how the textbooks are presented, whereas when it comes to Hindus, Hindus are orphans because they cannot provide money to the sahibs and all that stuff.

06:09:44.878 --> 06:09:48.101
But also, Hindus have been victims for millennia.

06:09:48.502 --> 06:09:56.149
And also, a lot of them have been genocided, including the person, the Kashmir Bandits, who spoke a few minutes ago, was a victim.

06:09:56.549 --> 06:10:08.081
So I urge you to reject all kinds of textbooks that present Hindus and Hinduism in a negative way, as opposed to fairness to the Hindus.

06:10:08.161 --> 06:10:08.441
Thank you.

06:10:12.039 --> 06:10:15.440
Good afternoon, dear members of the board and all of you present here.

06:10:15.460 --> 06:10:24.805
I just want to say each and every civilization across the world is having its pros and cons, but why all the cons are there in the books of the Indian culture.

06:10:25.305 --> 06:10:28.486
So I think truth is not there.

06:10:28.506 --> 06:10:32.828
Truth should be revealed when we are presenting both the aspects of good and bad.

06:10:33.288 --> 06:10:38.471
So truth is not about telling the bad stories about the Indian culture and the civilization.

06:10:38.571 --> 06:10:39.391
Thank you so much.

06:10:39.531 --> 06:10:41.172
I think you'll do the justice.

06:10:41.352 --> 06:10:41.672
Thank you.

06:10:45.157 --> 06:10:45.938
My name is Nidhi.

06:10:46.058 --> 06:10:47.961
I'm a 10th grader from Mountain House High School.

06:10:48.542 --> 06:10:56.432
Imagine being a 6th grader and opening up these textbooks to find out everything you've been taught about your culture society and religion is being misrepresented.

06:10:56.772 --> 06:11:02.140
This is just not my case but the cases of thousands of 6th graders all over California right now.

06:11:02.720 --> 06:11:06.523
Now, I've always looked for knowledge, and knowledge is equivalent to the worth of God.

06:11:06.863 --> 06:11:12.507
If this is true, do I follow something so high in worth, or do I follow what society has always taught me?

06:11:12.968 --> 06:11:15.089
Keep these questions in mind while making a decision.

06:11:15.209 --> 06:11:15.569
Thank you.

06:11:19.864 --> 06:11:30.306
Respected members, my name is Himanshu Shukla, and I just want to give you a kind notice that there are a few members of SHAFA who are coming and speaking again and again.

06:11:30.666 --> 06:11:34.207
So we need to be mindful of the fact that there are a lot of people waiting outside.

06:11:34.847 --> 06:11:40.148
So at the end, I just want to say, please reject HMH as recommended by IQC.

06:11:40.768 --> 06:11:43.389
I fully support edits submitted by Professor Jeffrey.

06:11:43.549 --> 06:11:45.429
Thank you so much.

06:11:50.348 --> 06:11:51.729
Hello, respected board members.

06:11:52.749 --> 06:11:54.790
I'm Saroj Satpatee from Pleasanton.

06:11:56.210 --> 06:11:57.750
I'm Saroj Satpatee from Pleasanton.

06:11:58.591 --> 06:12:01.692
You are the forward thinkers and trendsetters for California.

06:12:02.272 --> 06:12:06.333
I have a very simple question.

06:12:07.273 --> 06:12:14.575
My 13-year-old saw this textbook, come back to me, say, I read about Greek civilization versus Roman civilization.

06:12:15.316 --> 06:12:15.876
Am I this?

06:12:16.969 --> 06:12:22.751
I start, no, but I stop my younger one, come up, stop me there.

06:12:22.771 --> 06:12:25.292
I trust my brother.

06:12:26.152 --> 06:12:28.813
And it is written in the book, my brother said it.

06:12:30.314 --> 06:12:32.915
Please, I have the simple question to everybody.

06:12:33.355 --> 06:12:42.198
Please tell me, I will go back and what I will answer to my six-year-old so that the fact will be reflected in his mind.

06:12:42.518 --> 06:12:43.699
That's all I will answer.

06:12:51.493 --> 06:12:52.374
Good afternoon all.

06:12:52.954 --> 06:12:55.576
Thanks for providing me an opportunity to come and speak here.

06:12:56.197 --> 06:12:56.757
I am Asha.

06:12:57.758 --> 06:13:03.082
From the ongoing proceedings, I can figure out the real concerns of hundreds of parents like me.

06:13:03.122 --> 06:13:09.107
On the other hand, I am pleased to see a bunch of people from SAFA equating India to just a caste problem.

06:13:09.987 --> 06:13:13.410
Isn't there anything worthy for which India has to be remembered and revered?

06:13:14.215 --> 06:13:23.239
be it the field of math, astronomy, medicine, philosophy, dance, music, anything at all, I request the SP to do justice.

06:13:23.259 --> 06:13:25.860
The Prime Minister of India is a Dalit.

06:13:26.380 --> 06:13:27.801
I hope it conveys to you a lot.

06:13:28.141 --> 06:13:28.441
Thank you.

06:13:32.401 --> 06:13:33.342
Good afternoon, board members.

06:13:34.562 --> 06:13:35.243
My name is Pranav.

06:13:35.423 --> 06:13:37.804
I'm a coordinator with Hindu Education Foundation.

06:13:38.985 --> 06:13:48.410
We have actively worked with the IQC throughout the process, the framework process, and even the textbook recommendation process.

06:13:49.671 --> 06:13:51.352
We participated throughout the process.

06:13:51.852 --> 06:13:59.117
But what I've noticed today is that there's a group called South Asian Histories for All, which has suddenly appeared out of nowhere, and they're trying

06:14:00.097 --> 06:14:02.898
kind of portray that, hey, you guys are doing something really wrong.

06:14:03.418 --> 06:14:05.719
Participate from the beginning.

06:14:06.179 --> 06:14:09.580
So where were they when, you know, all the other processes were happening?

06:14:10.121 --> 06:14:15.242
You can't just come and, you know, sabotage something which has been going on for a long time.

06:14:15.463 --> 06:14:16.843
We have participated in the process.

06:14:18.584 --> 06:14:22.385
Also, some of the recommendations that they're giving, for example, removal of Saraswati.

06:14:23.047 --> 06:14:25.849
If they're really, then you'll violate the framework.

06:14:26.389 --> 06:14:29.551
So are they actually asking the textbooks to violate the framework?

06:14:30.632 --> 06:14:34.634
So I don't understand why they're doing this.

06:14:35.114 --> 06:14:38.376
I fully support the recommendations of the IQC.

06:14:39.077 --> 06:14:42.679
And thank you for allowing me to speak.

06:14:45.220 --> 06:14:46.680
respected board members.

06:14:46.820 --> 06:14:51.061
So I just want to highlight a few points from India, because a few friends said something negative.

06:14:51.081 --> 06:14:56.002
So I just want to tell you we feel proud that I'm a Hindu majority country.

06:14:56.482 --> 06:14:58.242
And my current president is a Dalit.

06:14:58.642 --> 06:14:59.783
His name is Ramnath Gond.

06:15:01.063 --> 06:15:04.283
The person who written the Constitution of India is a Dalit.

06:15:04.824 --> 06:15:05.904
We have a Sikh president.

06:15:06.144 --> 06:15:08.384
Sikh Dalit is also Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

06:15:09.084 --> 06:15:13.045
And the past one of the most religious book, Ramayana, is written by Balmiki.

06:15:13.849 --> 06:15:21.055
So you see Valmiki is a Dalit and the Vedas are written by again a Dalit with Vyasaji.

06:15:21.175 --> 06:15:24.837
So this is how you can come to know that what Dalits are living very happily.

06:15:24.957 --> 06:15:32.043
This is what Hinduism is known or the Hindu country India is known for all the religions and if you look the population of other

06:15:32.648 --> 06:15:34.971
religion, other groups are keep on increasing.

06:15:35.151 --> 06:15:36.613
In fact, we are in majority.

06:15:36.753 --> 06:15:38.596
This is not happening everywhere in the world.

06:15:38.716 --> 06:15:44.884
So this this is how you can come to know how peaceful we are and how respectful we are to the other.

06:15:44.944 --> 06:15:47.287
Same respect from other religion and other countries.

06:15:47.327 --> 06:15:48.729
True.

06:15:49.410 --> 06:15:49.630
Thank you.

06:16:02.285 --> 06:16:05.647
Good afternoon members.

06:16:05.667 --> 06:16:10.430
I'm currently in 6th grade attending Lawson Middle School in Sunnyvale.

06:16:10.671 --> 06:16:19.516
This year my class will study about different religions and ancient cultures around the world as part of a history and social science.

06:16:20.497 --> 06:16:21.257
Social science.

06:16:21.778 --> 06:16:23.459
We have not started reading about.

06:16:25.200 --> 06:16:26.781
My textbook I see several.

06:16:26.801 --> 06:16:29.243
People.

06:16:31.417 --> 06:16:34.660
I see several bad pictures in those chapters.

06:16:34.780 --> 06:16:40.564
For example a picture of people staying in slums and cows roaming around amongst garbage.

06:16:41.165 --> 06:16:47.230
I'm already worried how my non-Indian character will be teased and made fun of.

06:16:47.730 --> 06:16:51.133
In my school we talk about showing respect and caring for each other.

06:16:51.653 --> 06:16:59.940
Why are such things which go opposite in the opposite direction and encourage negative behavior put in the textbook.

06:17:01.238 --> 06:17:12.137
My humble request to you is to make sure that none of the new textbooks that come out next year have these problems.

06:17:12.277 --> 06:17:12.557
Thank you.

06:17:18.345 --> 06:17:22.909
Hi, my name, good afternoon, respected board members.

06:17:23.049 --> 06:17:29.394
Hi, I'm in sixth grade and I study in Lawson Middle School in Cupertino.

06:17:30.515 --> 06:17:42.345
I came to know that existing history and social science textbooks that I will be studying from in middle school have stuff that shows Hindus and Indians in,

06:17:45.087 --> 06:17:51.371
And what's more, nothing much is likely to be improved in the new textbooks.

06:17:52.491 --> 06:17:55.153
In the new textbooks which are coming out next year.

06:17:55.933 --> 06:17:57.334
I'm really concerned about this.

06:17:58.415 --> 06:18:09.561
Just as I want to learn more about other cultures and religions, I want my friends and my classmates to know more mine.

06:18:10.285 --> 06:18:17.108
Things like values that are important to my family, the festivals we celebrate.

06:18:17.128 --> 06:18:18.148
Time.

06:18:20.029 --> 06:18:23.770
And I want to feel proud of my culture to be able to talk about it.

06:18:25.471 --> 06:18:29.712
Please make sure that the stuff that goes into new textbooks will help that.

06:18:29.812 --> 06:18:30.252
Thank you.

06:18:30.272 --> 06:18:31.273
Thank you so much.

06:18:31.593 --> 06:18:31.933
Thank you.

06:18:35.791 --> 06:18:38.372
respected members of the State Board of Education.

06:18:39.112 --> 06:18:49.156
Ten years back, I think last time when we did the review, I was here asking to change or portray Hinduism in a positive manner and still that is not being done.

06:18:49.936 --> 06:18:56.138
And this is a right chance, hope I don't need to come next time here asking for this correction.

06:18:56.838 --> 06:19:02.904
And second thing, I saw that some of the groups are portraying that the kids and parents are here lobbied by somebody.

06:19:05.106 --> 06:19:09.491
They want to just misrepresent India, South Asia, all these kind of things.

06:19:09.891 --> 06:19:10.712
I feel very bad.

06:19:11.072 --> 06:19:14.055
These kids are coming after taking off from class.

06:19:14.416 --> 06:19:20.502
They want to make sure that their belief or the system what they believe and practice at home is represented properly.

06:19:21.262 --> 06:19:28.789
I request that the recommendation by Jeffrey Long be accepted to address all the problems in the book so that I don't need to come next after 10 years.

06:19:29.149 --> 06:19:29.550
Thank you.

06:19:29.850 --> 06:19:33.393
And sorry for keep you guys waiting and standing all the way through this process.

06:19:33.834 --> 06:19:34.154
Thank you.

06:19:37.287 --> 06:19:38.068
Namaste.

06:19:38.148 --> 06:19:42.912
My name is Arjun, and I am in second grade in Sedgwick Elementary School.

06:19:42.932 --> 06:19:48.616
I would like to explain the Bhagavad Gita and Ramayana translated by non-Hindus.

06:19:48.636 --> 06:19:50.958
There are no Hindu translators.

06:19:51.319 --> 06:19:57.884
Please have McGraw-Hill use A. C. Swami Prabhupada's translation of the Bhagavad Gita.

06:19:58.324 --> 06:20:00.226
Please see the letter from Hindupedia.

06:20:00.306 --> 06:20:00.726
Thank you.

06:20:00.746 --> 06:20:01.767
Thank you.

06:20:02.128 --> 06:20:02.388
Thanks.

06:20:06.787 --> 06:20:09.188
Good afternoon, respected members of the State Board of Education.

06:20:09.669 --> 06:20:10.889
My name is Srinivas Vinayakotta.

06:20:11.270 --> 06:20:12.710
I am the concerned father of two girls.

06:20:13.111 --> 06:20:14.011
This is my third time.

06:20:14.751 --> 06:20:18.033
In the last two years, I came to Sacramento and expressed my views.

06:20:18.674 --> 06:20:21.195
In these two years, IQC made good progress.

06:20:21.895 --> 06:20:24.777
I thank them for rejecting two girls at the same time.

06:20:25.177 --> 06:20:36.389
I am utterly shocked with the National Geographic, which has completely ignored the new framework, for example, skipping our core Hindu teachings, rituals, and tries to show Hindus as a primitive entity.

06:20:36.870 --> 06:20:42.616
This violates the California law, as well as the criteria for instructional material as mandated by the CDE.

06:20:46.600 --> 06:20:54.746
The textbook should be adopted only if all these changes are reflected, failing which the textbook not be adopted for teaching in California public schools.

06:20:55.186 --> 06:21:03.332
I demand that all the recommendations of academic coalition by Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other top academics be adopted.

06:21:13.459 --> 06:21:14.980
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

06:21:15.757 --> 06:21:16.897
and the young board member.

06:21:17.978 --> 06:21:21.959
I really appreciate your time and effort that you have put in in listening to us today.

06:21:22.499 --> 06:21:23.759
I'm going to say one thing.

06:21:23.779 --> 06:21:29.601
When I was in school, I teach my children, one of whom is in the eighth grade, one of whom is in college.

06:21:30.401 --> 06:21:31.601
Matru devo bhava.

06:21:32.382 --> 06:21:33.682
Mother is my first God.

06:21:34.262 --> 06:21:35.302
Pitru devo bhava.

06:21:35.743 --> 06:21:36.943
Father is my second God.

06:21:38.623 --> 06:21:39.804
Acharya devo bhava.

06:21:40.384 --> 06:21:41.964
Teacher is my third God.

06:21:42.444 --> 06:21:44.285
And then Atithi devo bhava is my fourth God.

06:21:45.230 --> 06:21:49.233
I want to emphasize on the third slogan, which says, teacher is my God.

06:21:50.334 --> 06:21:58.080
We teach our children what your teacher tells you is what is going to form you for not today, but for the rest of your life.

06:21:59.061 --> 06:22:00.362
Would you want it to person?

06:22:00.702 --> 06:22:01.443
I tell my son.

06:22:02.216 --> 06:22:07.537
If he complains about a teacher, you need to resolve, because the teacher will tell you what is good for you.

06:22:08.857 --> 06:22:11.378
Am I going to tell my son what the book represents?

06:22:11.418 --> 06:22:13.638
Because the teacher is given a book to teach from.

06:22:14.698 --> 06:22:16.579
That it is right when it is wrong.

06:22:17.599 --> 06:22:23.040
Would you want the children, for the rest of the kids that are here, their parents, to feel that?

06:22:23.560 --> 06:22:28.221
Think about the phrase that says, teacher is a God, that we teach our children.

06:22:28.381 --> 06:22:28.781
Thank you.

06:22:33.746 --> 06:22:35.848
Respected board members, good afternoon.

06:22:36.228 --> 06:22:37.429
My name is Gaurav Patwardhan.

06:22:37.889 --> 06:22:41.852
I'm from Lamersville Unified School District, where my son is currently enrolled.

06:22:42.633 --> 06:22:50.979
I'm also here representing BJP, an advocacy group focused on ensuring the correct representation of India and Hinduism in the US.

06:22:52.040 --> 06:22:58.844
We are deeply concerned about the state of the draft textbooks when it comes to how India and Hinduism are covered.

06:22:59.885 --> 06:23:09.651
Inclusion of texts like the Bhagavad Gita by translators, like done with McGraw-Hill and Discovery is adverse reflection on Hinduism.

06:23:10.956 --> 06:23:22.082
The Bhagavad Gita translation on page 280 should be replaced by the Bhagavad Gita itself, which is the most widely published Bhagavad Gita in the world and has translated in 50 languages.

06:23:22.943 --> 06:23:29.186
The Ramayana on page 281 should be replaced by an authorized translation like the one published by Gita Press.

06:23:29.747 --> 06:23:33.449
I also endorse the recommendations done by Professor Long and Hindupedia.

06:23:33.469 --> 06:23:33.769
Thank you.

06:23:39.628 --> 06:23:40.249
Namaste all.

06:23:40.269 --> 06:23:48.860
I'm a mother of a little daughter who is going to be schooled and I don't want my kid and any other kid to read negative about my religion.

06:23:49.000 --> 06:23:55.528
So it's my humble request to uphold the law and see to it that no derogative content is taught in our school.

06:23:55.708 --> 06:23:56.029
Thank you.

06:23:58.936 --> 06:24:00.918
Good afternoon, President Kirsten, board members.

06:24:00.958 --> 06:24:02.019
Thank you for your indulgence.

06:24:02.079 --> 06:24:03.180
My name is Alice Kessler.

06:24:03.200 --> 06:24:11.747
I'm here with California, the largest statewide organization representing lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people in California and nationwide.

06:24:12.368 --> 06:24:23.458
And I'm here today as a member of the Fair Education Act Implementation Coalition to support the Instructional Quality Commission's recommendation, which includes rejecting

06:24:25.620 --> 06:24:42.282
And approving the 10 other programs with the edits submitted by Studies Weekly, McGraw-Hill, and National Geographic would just say that Equality California was a sponsor of the Fair Implementation Act with Senator Leno and legislation that came before that by Senator Sheila Kuehl.

06:24:43.202 --> 06:24:51.308
You are brave and you fill so many Californians and young people in particular with hope that they will finally see themselves reflected in our textbooks.

06:24:51.969 --> 06:24:56.692
So we would applaud the IQC on their work in getting to this moment and would urge your support.

06:24:56.772 --> 06:24:57.112
Thank you.

06:25:05.658 --> 06:25:07.840
I'm with the California Legislative LGBT Caucus.

06:25:08.866 --> 06:25:20.694
We urge you to ensure that the historical contributions of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people are accurately and fairly portrayed in all instructional materials being considered for adoption in California.

06:25:21.414 --> 06:25:26.197
Students need to feel safe and self-confident and physically in order to learn and thrive in school.

06:25:26.918 --> 06:25:33.282
They are denied a safe school environment when they are exposed to negative stereotypes in classroom materials and school-sponsored activities.

06:25:34.162 --> 06:25:42.448
Student studies have shown that including the contributions of LGBT people in instructional materials is linked to greater student safety and lower rates of bullying.

06:25:44.089 --> 06:26:00.721
Your decision on these programs will ensure that only the materials adopted for use in California K-8 classrooms align with both the HSS framework and the social content standards and reflect the requirement under the Fair Education Act to include LGBT people in history and social science instructional materials.

06:26:01.241 --> 06:26:01.862
Thank you for your time.

06:26:07.017 --> 06:26:08.198
Good afternoon, board members.

06:26:08.639 --> 06:26:14.145
I am Dr. Kripa Rao, a scientist, a mom, and a person from the so-called lower castes.

06:26:14.825 --> 06:26:23.434
I have been working with the SBE and IQC very respectfully for the last four years in order to resolve our concerns on the textbook issue.

06:26:24.155 --> 06:26:35.223
today to protest some of the allegations that were leveled on us Hindu-Americans by the South Asian History for All group, where they accuse us of assault this morning.

06:26:35.943 --> 06:26:40.906
We came here by 6 AM, and we are peacefully waiting for our turn to speak.

06:26:42.147 --> 06:26:45.610
Members of SAFA can start the altercation with us.

06:26:46.310 --> 06:26:50.093
Families with small kids like ours are not mobs.

06:26:50.593 --> 06:26:52.734
Please, SAFA, be respectful.

06:26:53.815 --> 06:27:07.302
Also, when a representative of Sahafa had an epileptic seizure this morning, all of us went to help us with no regards to what caste such helpfulness is a part of the Indian culture.

06:27:08.082 --> 06:27:21.729
Sahafa also don't want sages like Valmiki and Vyasa to be included in the textbooks, even though these sages belong to the lower castes like me, and they have major contributions in the field of Ramayana and Mahabharata.

06:27:22.150 --> 06:27:22.510
Thank you.

06:27:26.594 --> 06:27:29.415
respected members of State Board of Education.

06:27:30.095 --> 06:27:31.415
I'm a father of an undergrad.

06:27:32.015 --> 06:27:40.296
So my son was ridiculed and bullied in middle school as well as high school because of the disparaging content about Hinduism in the textbooks.

06:27:41.137 --> 06:27:44.257
So it corroded his self-confidence culture.

06:27:44.957 --> 06:27:50.178
He had grade suffered and we could easily notice behavioral problem.

06:27:50.998 --> 06:27:55.499
Resultant emotional scars aren't fully cured even after all these years.

06:27:57.825 --> 06:28:07.515
I hope even my enemy doesn't suffer what we suffered because of the disparaging content in that Hinduism and India has so much to offer to humanity.

06:28:08.156 --> 06:28:11.139
Ancient Hindu scriptures are treasure trove of knowledge

06:28:12.581 --> 06:28:14.822
and wisdom, which is pertinent even in this age.

06:28:15.923 --> 06:28:20.446
Beetle's work was influenced and inspired by spiritual experience in India.

06:28:20.726 --> 06:28:23.428
Civil rights movement has its origin in India.

06:28:23.988 --> 06:28:27.910
Yoga has changed this world for a better place.

06:28:29.011 --> 06:28:36.556
By degrading Hinduism and textbooks, future policymakers of USA are deprived of a chance to curiosity and interest in Hinduism.

06:28:36.576 --> 06:28:38.697
Thanks.

06:28:42.688 --> 06:28:45.809
respectable board member for this opportunity to speak this afternoon.

06:28:47.129 --> 06:28:55.632
Ever since a nationalistic Prime Minister started leading the country, there are fringe groups who have become very intolerant of the majority belief.

06:28:56.112 --> 06:29:00.154
And these fringe groups basically try to divide the people on the caste lines.

06:29:00.634 --> 06:29:04.715
The Prime Minister himself is from a lower caste, the President of India, and we had

06:29:05.376 --> 06:29:07.017
from a minority Sikh community.

06:29:07.457 --> 06:29:15.424
He had a long beard and a moustache and there was a female quoting like a guy was killed because of growing moustache and beard, which is like not true at all.

06:29:15.864 --> 06:29:33.338
So please consider the opinion of millions of Hindus and disregard the rhetoric by these fringe groups like Safa, who a guy from a backward class becomes a prime minister and Hindus are standing up today and voice out their concerns in case there is any attack on their religion.

06:29:33.779 --> 06:29:42.078
So please consider the opinion of all the majority sections of the Hindus and take the rightful decision and don't let kids get bullied in schools.

06:29:42.118 --> 06:29:42.980
It's in your hands now.

06:29:43.180 --> 06:29:43.441
Thank you.

06:29:48.735 --> 06:29:49.055
Hi there.

06:29:49.395 --> 06:29:51.016
My name is Tirthankar Bhaumik.

06:29:51.637 --> 06:29:54.018
I'm a parent of two kids in Fremont.

06:29:55.659 --> 06:30:00.982
So I'm really concerned about the representation of Hinduism.

06:30:01.622 --> 06:30:04.584
And thank you IQC for rejecting my textbook.

06:30:05.345 --> 06:30:11.048
So I would like to endorse the changes which have been recommended by Hindupedia and Professor Long.

06:30:12.348 --> 06:30:18.771
just wanted to say that America itself was discovered because of India, because Columbus wanted to find a trade route to India.

06:30:19.191 --> 06:30:23.173
So please remember this and represent us.

06:30:23.293 --> 06:30:25.053
Thank you very much.

06:30:32.016 --> 06:30:37.218
Thank you.

06:30:40.177 --> 06:30:42.678
Namaste my name is Sanjeevani Dej.

06:30:42.978 --> 06:30:43.398
I am.

06:30:43.418 --> 06:30:46.600
I do not want to be bullied when I go on 6th grade.

06:30:46.620 --> 06:30:56.324
Hinduism is one of the oldest and all accepting religion where we have a lot of colorful festivals which we celebrate victory of good over evil.

06:30:56.864 --> 06:30:59.725
However I heard nothing about this taught in schools.

06:31:00.986 --> 06:31:03.487
I was is asking for dignity.

06:31:03.507 --> 06:31:08.349
Please reject biased books as they are illegal.

06:31:08.629 --> 06:31:08.969
Thank you.

06:31:15.171 --> 06:31:20.257
From us the respected board members my name is Amrita Joshi I go to Rose Elementary School in Lopez.

06:31:20.898 --> 06:31:22.881
Hinduism believes in divinity.

06:31:25.444 --> 06:31:28.067
As it gives so much without complaint.

06:31:28.748 --> 06:31:30.010
But looking at this picture.

06:31:34.827 --> 06:31:37.532
that in the textbook it's shown eating trash.

06:31:38.032 --> 06:31:39.955
Everyone knows that cows don't eat trash.

06:31:40.376 --> 06:31:42.940
Why are you allowing such books to be taught in schools.

06:31:45.304 --> 06:31:46.947
Content is bad and illegal.

06:31:47.107 --> 06:31:47.468
Thank you.

06:31:53.684 --> 06:31:57.547
Hi, my name is Sridhar Jalapuram, and I'm from the Cupertino School District.

06:31:57.607 --> 06:31:59.848
Both my kids go to the district.

06:31:59.948 --> 06:32:12.536
I'm deeply concerned about the state of the draft textbooks when it comes to... I'm relieved to hear that the IQC has requested that Houghton Mifflin, Harcourt's K-6, and the 6-8 text be rejected.

06:32:13.156 --> 06:32:39.235
In addition I request that the draft textbook from National Geographic ignores grade 6 ignores the history socials framework I endorse the recommendations from To recommend that our accredited sages or translations like that of AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada the Bhagavad-gita be added to the textbook the point I'm making it because is the

06:32:40.656 --> 06:32:58.905
Texts like bhagavad-gita are translated by people from outside People are like poets and journalists who don't understand the crux of the bhagavad-gita, and they can add their own Ideas into that so we would like a genuine person to be doing it and so that's my request.

06:32:59.086 --> 06:32:59.706
Thank you very much

06:33:06.264 --> 06:33:08.065
My name is Shankar Das Shivagana.

06:33:08.285 --> 06:33:10.066
I am a resident of Sunnyvale.

06:33:11.486 --> 06:33:14.268
Thank you for giving me a chance to speak my part.

06:33:15.088 --> 06:33:15.908
I know you've had a long day.

06:33:16.328 --> 06:33:21.851
Okay, so I support the recommendations of IQC to reject the textbooks.

06:33:22.011 --> 06:33:28.874
I also support the media in correcting some of the content in the textbooks.

06:33:31.334 --> 06:33:40.157
As an American Hindu, I find the views of SAFA and groups like them to be non-representative of my views and the views of my friends and family.

06:33:41.638 --> 06:33:56.983
Now on the topic of translations, in any academic field you sort of want the best of the best, and the tradition of Sanskrit scholarship in India goes back thousands of years, and in fact a lot of Western

06:34:00.660 --> 06:34:09.492
A grammatical scholarship is based on the works of Patini, and I recommend that you do adopt the texts of Bhaktivinoda Swami Prabhupada.

06:34:10.013 --> 06:34:10.574
Okay, thank you.

06:34:13.766 --> 06:34:15.027
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

06:34:15.567 --> 06:34:16.508
My name is Sridhar Raju.

06:34:16.568 --> 06:34:19.770
I come from the Pleasanton Unified School District.

06:34:20.010 --> 06:34:22.691
Two of my boys went to Pleasanton Unified School District.

06:34:22.711 --> 06:34:25.653
The older one is in high school now.

06:34:26.734 --> 06:34:32.977
One day, what happened was that my son came home and said, Dad, there is an essay I have to write on Hinduism.

06:34:33.638 --> 06:34:38.821
And he says, Dad, I don't want to write about Brahmins because they actually did a lot of bad things.

06:34:39.381 --> 06:34:42.382
And that's the time when I realized that there's something wrong with the textbooks.

06:34:43.003 --> 06:34:46.284
And I went to see the content which is not representative.

06:34:46.664 --> 06:34:55.168
So I explained to him about the kindness and the mercy and the honesty that the values that encompass the Brahmin culture.

06:34:55.748 --> 06:34:57.409
And he wrote an essay based on that.

06:34:57.469 --> 06:34:59.330
He got an A plus on that report.

06:34:59.850 --> 06:35:03.091
So he came back and said, Dad, I'm proud that you really taught me.

06:35:05.873 --> 06:35:20.433
Now is my chance to tell you that I'm really happy that your ICQ has rejected the changes, so I support Dr. Long's recommendation and Hindupedia.

06:35:20.553 --> 06:35:21.154
Thank you very much.

06:35:25.270 --> 06:35:26.530
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

06:35:26.590 --> 06:35:50.078
My name is Suresh and I come from the city of Saratoga and I'm here to express my concern about the textbooks that I taught teaching about Hinduism in in classes six to eight, which is not the right understanding of Hinduism to know things to understand the truth and the truth which has been there.

06:35:50.258 --> 06:35:50.878
It's not right.

06:35:51.458 --> 06:35:53.519
I urge to just take the

06:35:53.999 --> 06:35:58.046
content from the right scriptures, which is a Bhagavad Gita written by A.C.

06:35:58.066 --> 06:36:03.134
Bhaktivedanta Swami available in many languages to be the right representation of Hinduism.

06:36:10.188 --> 06:36:22.745
Dear lovely board members, I am a father of two, and because of the problems that we talked about with so many of my friends over here, I actually took the decision that I will not send my kids to school and homeschool them.

06:36:25.268 --> 06:36:27.231
I am actually studying with my kid as he studies.

06:36:27.551 --> 06:36:30.995
I am going through the challenges that he does so that he can escape some of these things.

06:36:31.416 --> 06:36:36.502
I don't want him to feel disgruntled and feel frustrated with how things are represented here.

06:36:37.082 --> 06:36:37.803
I do support IQC.

06:36:38.644 --> 06:36:41.728
I am against the way SIFS is representing things.

06:36:42.149 --> 06:36:43.370
I want India and Hinduism to be represented.

06:36:45.322 --> 06:36:59.983
saying can you actually spread the mission of love so that people don't segregate societies and people in religions and things like that and just open up their heart that's what India is that's what all humanity is all about can we do that please to the books it's humble request thank you

06:37:05.185 --> 06:37:11.555
Respected members of State Board of Education, my name is Namrata Srivastava and I am a resident of El Dorado Hills, California.

06:37:12.376 --> 06:37:15.480
I stand here to oppose hatred against Hindus and Indians.

06:37:16.101 --> 06:37:20.308
I fully support the decision of IQC to reject the two programs of HMH.

06:37:21.309 --> 06:37:27.212
while some other textbook programs are good, racist, hinduphobic, and the worst in quality.

06:37:27.872 --> 06:37:37.677
They have numerous violations of category 1 of adoption guidelines, especially category 1.10, which prohibits adverse reflection based on religion and ethnicity.

06:37:38.397 --> 06:37:42.419
They also violate the California law, which prohibits religious discriminations.

06:37:42.799 --> 06:37:43.399
For example,

06:37:45.276 --> 06:37:55.602
It inaccurately shows Buddhism and Sikhism as an improvement over Hinduism, which is a clear adverse reflection and violates Category 1.0 of adoption guidelines.

06:37:56.022 --> 06:38:02.026
Hence, I truly request you to reject HMHS2 programs as recommended by IQC.

06:38:02.306 --> 06:38:03.086
Thank you for listening.

06:38:12.739 --> 06:38:14.879
Hello, my name is Avinash, and I'm from Fremont.

06:38:15.440 --> 06:38:19.100
I stand here to oppose hatred against Hinduism and Indians.

06:38:19.821 --> 06:38:29.223
I fully support the decision of IQC to reject the two programs of HMH programs that are blatantly racist, Hinduphobic, and worst in content.

06:38:30.063 --> 06:38:34.804
They have numerous violations of Category 1 adoption guidelines, especially Category 1.10.

06:38:35.784 --> 06:38:39.885
And hence, I ask to reject HMH2 program as recommended by IQC.

06:38:40.045 --> 06:38:40.585
Thank you so much.

06:38:44.148 --> 06:38:48.474
I am in Parkmont Elementary for the Fremont Unified School District.

06:38:48.975 --> 06:38:55.384
My school uses the McGraw-Hill text and I'm starting Ancient India and Hinduism next week in class.

06:38:56.065 --> 06:38:59.230
I went through the materials in advance and felt from the very beginning

06:39:00.331 --> 06:39:02.213
The text made me feel discriminated against.

06:39:02.673 --> 06:39:06.136
It starts with something I've never discussed at home.

06:39:06.576 --> 06:39:09.739
In fact, caste doesn't impact any aspect in my life.

06:39:10.420 --> 06:39:20.148
Further on, I saw that the translators for excerpts from other religious texts were from that faith, but for the Bhagavad Gita and Ramayana, that is not the case.

06:39:21.469 --> 06:39:23.310
They are using Christian translators for

06:39:25.230 --> 06:39:25.590
I support.

06:39:25.630 --> 06:39:26.230
I support.

06:39:26.250 --> 06:39:27.010
I support.

06:39:57.307 --> 06:40:06.326
Any speakers or any individuals who have signed up to speak, up through numbers 400, please sign up if you're not already in line.

06:40:06.407 --> 06:40:06.767
Thank you.

06:40:10.302 --> 06:40:10.902
Good afternoon.

06:40:11.903 --> 06:40:13.243
My name is Ashwin Mathew.

06:40:13.263 --> 06:40:15.284
I'm with South Asian Histories for All.

06:40:15.304 --> 06:40:17.744
I'm a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley.

06:40:19.285 --> 06:40:22.526
I would like you to consider the people who aren't in this room today.

06:40:22.546 --> 06:40:32.869
We all have been absent from some of the hearings in the last couple of months because we have been responding to hate crimes within our own communities in this current political climate.

06:40:33.549 --> 06:40:35.790
As you may know, that's not restricted just to the US.

06:40:35.850 --> 06:40:38.251
Of course, this is also happening back home in India.

06:40:38.951 --> 06:40:57.690
So as you deliberate on these textbooks and what they mean, please connect to the Muslims, the Sikhs, the progressive Hindus, the people who are of working class who are unable to make it to these hearings, whether responding to issues of violence in their own communities or because they simply have to work and cannot make it here today.

06:40:58.210 --> 06:41:02.895
And I ask you to remember their voices, even as you hear the mass of other voices before you today.

06:41:06.345 --> 06:41:08.246
Good afternoon.

06:41:09.707 --> 06:41:17.451
You know, when we are talking about religion and culture, you know, we know every religion has lots of words of wisdom to share with humanity.

06:41:18.011 --> 06:41:22.734
And our textbooks are, you know, for the future generation to train them in the right principles.

06:41:23.214 --> 06:41:24.295
So I know that.

06:41:24.975 --> 06:41:37.286
The content of our textbooks reflect the positives in each and every religion, including Hinduism, and not cite selected examples which might show any religion, you know, in the bad light.

06:41:37.746 --> 06:41:40.789
So with that, I would like to quote or I would like to cite

06:41:41.309 --> 06:41:47.391
that the most authorized version of our religion is by the scholar named A.C.

06:41:47.431 --> 06:41:48.952
Bhaktivedanta Srila Prabhupada.

06:41:49.592 --> 06:41:57.475
And he has shown to the world by example what real scriptures of the Vedic tradition is, which is called Hinduism now.

06:41:57.975 --> 06:42:07.579
And I would like you to really ponder over this issue and not go by popular journalism or our so-called Sanskrit scholar, but really don't understand the religion as well.

06:42:07.879 --> 06:42:08.199
Thank you.

06:42:14.400 --> 06:42:15.941
Hi, respected members of the board.

06:42:16.281 --> 06:42:17.362
I bring two good things.

06:42:18.163 --> 06:42:19.403
One, it's going to be over real soon.

06:42:19.604 --> 06:42:20.524
Not many people outside.

06:42:21.745 --> 06:42:23.106
And you're not missing the California weather.

06:42:23.286 --> 06:42:39.978
I want to reiterate the coalition of support that has been here from APAP, NCAAP, LGBT, California Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Anti-Defamation League, and a dozen other organizations with support the rejection of these textbooks.

06:42:41.259 --> 06:42:58.911
17 elected officials from the California... 2,000 people have spoken in the last few years, 40,000 signed petitions, about more than 10,000 emails sent and 8,000 physical letters sent, all in support of accurate and equitable textbooks.

06:43:00.692 --> 06:43:08.938
All we ask is to reject the... the approval of National Geographic's final submission.

06:43:10.236 --> 06:43:10.816
Thank you so much.

06:43:11.457 --> 06:43:14.299
There are a few people behind me who are trying to not speak, but just support.

06:43:14.359 --> 06:43:14.639
Thank you.

06:43:14.859 --> 06:43:15.299
We support.

06:43:15.499 --> 06:43:16.020
We support.

06:43:16.260 --> 06:43:16.780
Thank you.

06:43:16.820 --> 06:43:17.320
I support.

06:43:18.061 --> 06:43:20.262
I support.

06:43:20.302 --> 06:43:20.683
Support.

06:43:24.725 --> 06:43:24.885
Hello.

06:43:25.485 --> 06:43:26.286
My name Raj Kumar.

06:43:26.426 --> 06:43:30.769
I am from Rewalanda, Srivastava, California.

06:43:32.003 --> 06:43:37.169
I suggest that India still have a caste system and vast caste system.

06:43:37.990 --> 06:43:43.437
Mostly Dalit people are being killed by the Hindus and they are name of the cow.

06:43:44.018 --> 06:43:46.561
People are being killed by like animals.

06:43:47.031 --> 06:43:48.332
No, no one take action.

06:43:48.673 --> 06:43:50.214
No, any legal action have taken.

06:43:50.735 --> 06:43:55.320
Even Babasaheb Dr. Ambedkar burned Manusmriti Hindu grants.

06:43:55.600 --> 06:44:03.008
That's why I suggest to include Dr. B R Ambedkar books in syllabus.

06:44:05.489 --> 06:44:08.312
are based on casteism, no one take action.

06:44:08.832 --> 06:44:15.659
Whoever killed Dallas, I suggest delay the vote of approval, fix mistake.

06:44:16.860 --> 06:44:17.120
Thank you.

06:44:25.448 --> 06:44:26.650
State Board of Education.

06:44:26.970 --> 06:44:28.992
I am Yogesh Shikde from Sunnyvale, California.

06:44:29.838 --> 06:44:35.443
Last year, when the framework was revised, many positive contributions to Hinduism and ancient India sections were added.

06:44:36.804 --> 06:44:42.889
National Geographic has completely ignored 20 major items from Hindu history, thereby completely erasing our history.

06:44:45.411 --> 06:44:51.876
Contribution of Hindu lower caste sages like Vyasa, Valmiki and description of our sacred texts, the Vedas.

06:44:52.637 --> 06:44:58.281
This is a clear violation of Category 1.2 and 1.12 of the HSS Adoption Guidelines.

06:44:59.402 --> 06:45:07.687
This is clear discrimination against a culture causing huge number of violations of Category 1.2 and 1.16 corrections in a letter on November 6th.

06:45:08.347 --> 06:45:14.692
We ask the SBE to accept the corrections that National Geographic has suggested so that it brings accuracy to the textbooks.

06:45:15.972 --> 06:45:19.475
I urge you to adopt the textbooks only if the corrections that they have suggested are taken.

06:45:20.964 --> 06:45:22.967
My friends here are here to support.

06:45:22.987 --> 06:45:26.012
Thank you.

06:45:36.478 --> 06:45:38.839
respected members of State Board of Education.

06:45:39.200 --> 06:45:41.200
I'm Vasudha from Folsom, California.

06:45:41.941 --> 06:45:49.885
McGraw-Hill Textbooks has, for example, actually inaccurately said that Ashoka became Buddhist after the war.

06:45:50.345 --> 06:45:54.327
But in fact, he embraced Buddhism three years before the actual war.

06:45:54.967 --> 06:45:59.590
IQC made correction in one place in last hearing after it was pointed out.

06:45:59.990 --> 06:46:02.151
But in two places, the error still exists.

06:46:02.771 --> 06:46:06.252
These small elements go a long way in minimizing Hindus.

06:46:06.672 --> 06:46:08.432
So it is important to rectify them.

06:46:09.113 --> 06:46:12.373
There are many such inaccuracies in the macro health textbooks.

06:46:12.933 --> 06:46:18.635
I support the recommendations of Professor Jeffrey Long and 38 other academicians.

06:46:19.095 --> 06:46:23.616
I request you to take the academic group's recommendation to address all of them.

06:46:23.976 --> 06:46:28.757
I also request you to reject the hate against Hindus.

06:46:29.237 --> 06:46:29.698
Thank you.

06:46:29.718 --> 06:46:31.518
I support it.

06:46:32.145 --> 06:46:32.525
I support.

06:46:33.266 --> 06:46:33.686
I support.

06:46:41.249 --> 06:46:42.790
Respected members of SBE.

06:46:46.281 --> 06:46:54.488
On Monday, a last-minute letter was submitted to you by HMH regarding their 6-8 program that was rejected by IQC.

06:46:54.988 --> 06:46:57.070
They have made several claims in the letter.

06:46:57.510 --> 06:47:04.576
We would like to show how the claims are based on their subjective analysis and not the criteria as a code of regulations.

06:47:05.317 --> 06:47:06.377
This is in front of you.

06:47:06.878 --> 06:47:09.220
The appendix has the tables that has the data.

06:47:09.600 --> 06:47:10.821
Here are the broad points.

06:47:11.361 --> 06:47:20.267
One, HMH in their letter acknowledge the higher than normal volume of correction, but classify the majority of errors incorrectly as errata.

06:47:20.827 --> 06:47:29.272
We have analyzed their changes utilizing the definition of 9510H, 9510R.

06:47:29.472 --> 06:47:33.875
Our analysis finds their claims are not only inaccurate, but they are misleading.

06:47:46.551 --> 06:47:52.294
We have provided grade-wise data with severity of changes that clarifies much higher volume of changes.

06:47:52.634 --> 06:48:00.358
In our analysis, we found that 26% or 946 of changes that they submitted are very significant changes.

06:48:01.018 --> 06:48:04.960
If we consider edits of medium severity also, the edits are considerably significant.

06:48:05.780 --> 06:48:07.201
causing changes in the narrative.

06:48:07.721 --> 06:48:16.047
Even with such major rewrites, it fails to solve the underlying issue of adverse reflection as defined in Category 1.10 of HSS Adoption Guidelines.

06:48:16.527 --> 06:48:24.273
Even the changes that were submitted were incomplete, where the edits talk of replacements but don't tell full details.

06:48:25.614 --> 06:48:31.578
No publisher content can be allowed based on a promise of change when the content itself is not known.

06:48:41.041 --> 06:48:49.346
in the continuation of the previous speech of the Hinduism and Christianity section failed to even address the violation of Category 1.

06:48:50.166 --> 06:48:57.670
HMH drafts are blankly racist, stereotypical and show Hinduism as inferior to other religions.

06:48:58.091 --> 06:49:06.936
Hence, we ask you to recommend the rejection of HMH 6.2 as recommended by the National Quality Commission.

06:49:07.776 --> 06:49:08.076
Thank you.

06:49:16.775 --> 06:49:19.858
Namaste, respected members of the State Board of Education.

06:49:20.459 --> 06:49:22.461
I'm Shipra Varshney from Santa Clara.

06:49:23.001 --> 06:49:26.905
I'm here seeking Dr. Jaya's advice and team recommendations.

06:49:27.546 --> 06:49:34.713
And I'm also here to oppose any kind of alarmist and anarchism by Hinduphobic group such as SAFA.

06:49:35.154 --> 06:49:35.514
Thank you.

06:49:36.175 --> 06:49:36.655
Please support.

06:49:36.675 --> 06:49:36.956
Thank you.

06:49:45.655 --> 06:49:47.276
I'm a member of SBE.

06:49:48.257 --> 06:49:51.779
I'm from Sunnyvale, and I'm a mother of two.

06:49:52.740 --> 06:49:59.264
On Monday, an anonymous letter was submitted to you by a group named South Asian Histories for All, SAFA.

06:50:00.025 --> 06:50:03.507
The letter claims that the HSS framework is not being followed.

06:50:05.989 --> 06:50:07.210
Based on this contentious.

06:50:08.010 --> 06:50:11.493
Here we present an analysis of their demand in the letter.

06:50:12.413 --> 06:50:14.075
The analysis is in front of you.

06:50:14.956 --> 06:50:23.426
Firstly, in 32 of 43 revisions proposed by SAFA, the publisher's original text already comply.

06:50:25.943 --> 06:50:31.725
to framework, but SAFA appears to be seeking deletions or alterations to this.

06:50:32.706 --> 06:50:41.389
They are hence forcing the publisher drafts into noncompliance of framework and adoption guidelines, especially category 1.2 and 1.12.

06:50:41.449 --> 06:50:41.869
Thank you.

06:50:51.354 --> 06:51:00.101
If you are planning on addressing the board on this item and have numbers anywhere between 1 and 500 and 550, please line up.

06:51:00.721 --> 06:51:00.801
Ms.

06:51:00.861 --> 06:51:01.362
Feister?

06:51:01.382 --> 06:51:03.443
We believe that we've had 394 speakers.

06:51:05.325 --> 06:51:05.765
Thank you.

06:51:16.789 --> 06:51:17.389
You may go ahead.

06:51:18.070 --> 06:51:19.150
Thank you so much for being here.

06:51:19.871 --> 06:51:20.191
Thank you.

06:51:20.992 --> 06:51:24.654
Respected members of State Board of Education, my name is Patton from UBerdeen.

06:51:25.374 --> 06:51:41.864
As a continuation from whatever the previous speaker has said, many of SAFA's suggestions are blatantly anti-Hindu and adversely reflect on Hinduism, leading to violation of Category 1.10 of the HSS Adoption Criteria and California's Education Codes.

06:51:42.484 --> 06:51:44.746
Thirdly, SAFA is a history neglect.

06:51:45.566 --> 06:51:49.927
But it is ironic that most of their edits in the fact call for deletion of content.

06:51:50.428 --> 06:51:55.569
Safa blatantly even suggests the removal of a section on Hinduism in one of their drafts.

06:51:56.230 --> 06:52:03.412
Lastly, nowhere in their letter do we see any suggestion to add the cultural or religious contribution of so-called lower castes.

06:52:03.432 --> 06:52:11.355
Because of the efforts of HHF, histories of Hindu sages and saints from so-called lower castes were added in the framework.

06:52:11.635 --> 06:52:11.955
Thank you.

06:52:12.788 --> 06:52:13.611
I support.

06:52:13.792 --> 06:52:14.454
We support.

06:52:15.257 --> 06:52:15.698
I support.

06:52:25.952 --> 06:52:34.541
As a continuation to the previous speaker, we thank you for your hard work in developing the curriculum framework and enforcing the social content standards.

06:52:35.261 --> 06:52:44.951
As standards and evaluation criteria and CLR demands, each child should feel the pride in his or her heritage and develop a sense of self-quality of opportunity.

06:52:45.912 --> 06:52:48.074
They also forbid negative stereotyping.

06:52:48.777 --> 06:52:53.961
The bigoted and highly biased Hinduphobic edits of SAFA are directly contradictory to the law.

06:52:54.542 --> 06:52:57.484
We have made a point-by-point analysis of SAFA's letter.

06:52:57.905 --> 06:53:10.555
It clearly shows that the asks and the alarmism of SAFA are based on very... We also commend you for not getting alarmed by the letter and staying on course with the SBA agenda.

06:53:10.915 --> 06:53:11.596
Thank you very much.

06:53:20.342 --> 06:53:20.442
Yeah.

06:53:20.482 --> 06:53:22.163
Hi, my name is Mehul Bastavala.

06:53:22.603 --> 06:53:24.603
I'm from Art of Living.

06:53:26.224 --> 06:53:31.346
So the main points I wanted to mention was to fix the dates of ancient India and Ramayana.

06:53:31.846 --> 06:53:35.367
So the Saraswati River dried around 2500 BC.

06:53:35.507 --> 06:53:36.607
I've sent these letters out.

06:53:36.647 --> 06:53:37.868
You can refer half an hour back.

06:53:39.709 --> 06:53:46.291
And so it is around 3,000-4,000 BC is the Indus Valley Civilization, which is man-made.

06:53:46.491 --> 06:53:49.833
There are NASA photographs that shows that it's nine feet below.

06:53:50.293 --> 06:53:54.074
So with 0.3 millimeters, 0.4 of rise every year, it is 7,000 years old.

06:53:55.555 --> 06:53:57.616
So I would like you to fix the dates.

06:53:58.076 --> 06:54:01.697
Whenever like people mention about Vedas, they say like it's a thousand years BC.

06:54:01.797 --> 06:54:06.099
No, it's not to fit that audience.

06:54:06.459 --> 06:54:08.659
And Ramayans go all the way to 5000 BC.

06:54:09.400 --> 06:54:09.900
That was one.

06:54:09.960 --> 06:54:21.584
And then the other thing was include some quotes from Western authors and scientists about India so that people understand the true value and contribution and the democratic system that they had.

06:54:22.164 --> 06:54:23.865
And also explain what yoga is.

06:54:25.725 --> 06:54:27.146
Just give it to our staff thank you.

06:54:27.786 --> 06:54:29.126
Next please come forward.

06:54:33.028 --> 06:54:39.950
Dear members of the State Board of Education my name is Anshuman and I am an eighth grader at John F. Kennedy Middle School in Cupertino.

06:54:40.630 --> 06:54:44.952
As an American student I should not be labeled on the basis of what we believe in at the

06:54:46.878 --> 06:54:51.060
The analogy would be like seeing white Americans solely as perpetrators of slavery.

06:54:51.800 --> 06:54:58.202
My concern is about the wrong portrayal of Hinduism in textbooks by using denigrating pictures of trash and pigs.

06:54:58.983 --> 06:55:02.964
The discovery textbook shows the slums and asks the students to identify.

06:55:05.945 --> 06:55:07.906
that Hinduism is only about caste.

06:55:08.626 --> 06:55:15.869
I request you to remove these wrong pictures about Hinduism and show the positive contributions that Hinduism has done to the world.

06:55:16.249 --> 06:55:16.630
Thank you.

06:55:17.950 --> 06:55:18.390
I support.

06:55:19.291 --> 06:55:19.831
I support.

06:55:19.951 --> 06:55:20.311
Thank you.

06:55:25.633 --> 06:55:28.254
Respected board members, my name is Satyaj Choudhury.

06:55:28.655 --> 06:55:31.856
I'm serving as the president of the Overseas Volunteers for a Better India.

06:55:32.566 --> 06:55:37.510
and we represent over 100,000 Indian-American families across all faiths in the US.

06:55:38.731 --> 06:55:43.135
There's a whole bunch of crazy stuff that has been written about India and Hinduism in the textbooks.

06:55:43.315 --> 06:55:49.760
Let me just quote one of them from Einstein, what he felt about India and its heritage.

06:55:51.781 --> 06:55:55.565
So what he said was, we are deeply indebted to the Indians.

06:55:55.965 --> 06:55:57.847
They have shown us how to measure and count.

06:55:58.668 --> 06:56:07.156
If we had not known their invention of zero and the facility it affords in counting, we wouldn't have made any invention, Einstein had to say about India.

06:56:07.176 --> 06:56:08.998
Another one by Oppenheimer.

06:56:09.961 --> 06:56:15.042
Access to the Vedas is the greatest privilege this century may claim over all previous centuries.

06:56:15.883 --> 06:56:20.224
My request is that there is so much richness that these great thinkers have seen in India.

06:56:20.504 --> 06:56:28.066
And I request that we please include these in the California textbooks and edit.

06:56:28.106 --> 06:56:28.886
So please include them.

06:56:28.966 --> 06:56:29.186
Thanks.

06:56:36.243 --> 06:56:39.324
Hello, my name is Lamitard here, and I'm currently in 10th grade.

06:56:39.685 --> 06:56:43.466
When I was in 6th grade, we were learning about ancient India and the textbook we used.

06:56:44.087 --> 06:56:47.188
I was very shocked to see this discriminatory example in the textbook.

06:56:47.748 --> 06:56:55.552
When we went out for lunch, a few of my classmates asked me taunting questions about whether this was normal in India, and if all Indians lived in such dirty conditions.

06:56:56.112 --> 06:57:00.754
This comment really hurt me, and I did not want my classmates to think of my culture in such a bad way.

06:57:01.294 --> 06:57:04.916
A recent survey on bullying conducted among history said that about one

06:57:05.636 --> 06:57:14.238
More respondents have been bullied within the past year with about a third saying those bully who bullied them Are we're making fun of Hindu traditions?

06:57:14.778 --> 06:57:29.122
I am afraid this number will keep growing if false and biased information about Hinduism continues to be part of the textbooks I strongly urge you to continue to reject hardcore As recommended by IQC as they have the same problems as before.

06:57:29.342 --> 06:57:29.702
Thank you.

06:57:30.963 --> 06:57:32.363
I support I support

06:57:43.253 --> 06:57:50.756
I would like to applaud IQC for rejecting the Harcourt programs and thank the department for having me here.

06:57:51.217 --> 06:57:56.519
However, I am appalled at the racist content portrayed by McGraw-Hill, Discovery, in addition to HMH.

06:57:57.140 --> 06:58:04.003
This content is not only deliberately misrepresentative of Hinduism, but goes directly against California state law, namely Educator 160040.

06:58:06.264 --> 06:58:14.746
Also, the bullying report released by HAF highlighted, quote, one out of every three respondents said they had been bullied for religious belief, half indicated social isolation.

06:58:15.347 --> 06:58:21.588
As a student, it is unacceptable to allow this sort of discrimination and bullying to occur at the expense of Hindu-American children.

06:58:22.248 --> 06:58:32.731
While also disseminating, once again, to reject both HMH programs, McGraw-Hill, and Discovery for their blatantly racist information on Hinduism.

06:58:32.831 --> 06:58:33.151
Thank you.

06:58:35.012 --> 06:58:35.332
I support.

06:58:36.795 --> 06:58:37.275
I support.

06:58:37.556 --> 06:58:38.056
I support.

06:58:38.997 --> 06:58:39.477
I support.

06:58:40.918 --> 06:58:41.399
I support.

06:58:45.762 --> 06:58:46.203
I support.

06:58:49.866 --> 06:58:55.570
Respected board members, thank you for giving us an opportunity to come and speak in front of you, showing our concern.

06:58:56.831 --> 06:59:03.317
I just want to let you know that it is strange that fringe Hinduphobic group, South Asian Histories for All, SAFA, is asking to

06:59:07.385 --> 06:59:11.868
content in the section on Hinduism and ancient India in all textbooks is about caste.

06:59:12.768 --> 06:59:16.790
No other section discusses social structure of its civilization in such a detail.

06:59:17.951 --> 06:59:20.573
It sounds hollow when they say caste is being erased.

06:59:21.493 --> 06:59:22.654
No one is trying to erase it.

06:59:23.475 --> 06:59:29.998
Such a way as to perpetuate hatred against Hindus.

06:59:31.299 --> 06:59:33.921
They are trying to add a Hinduphobic view of caste into the textbooks.

06:59:34.693 --> 06:59:37.636
We are not saying cash should not be discussed, but it should be neutral.

06:59:38.156 --> 06:59:39.417
Thanks for giving me the opportunity again.

06:59:39.638 --> 06:59:39.898
Thank you.

06:59:41.099 --> 06:59:41.800
I support this.

06:59:42.781 --> 06:59:43.481
I support this.

06:59:43.501 --> 06:59:47.445
I support this.

06:59:47.465 --> 06:59:48.286
Thank you all for coming.

06:59:48.346 --> 06:59:50.087
I appreciate your comments.

06:59:51.269 --> 06:59:52.690
Next person come forward, please.

06:59:53.030 --> 06:59:53.691
Thank you so much.

06:59:58.348 --> 07:00:16.602
Respected members of the state board of education, I stand in front of you to speak against the support of Asians, LGBTQ community, and numerous Hindu, Jain, and interfaith groups, academics, educators, as well as the thousands of Hindus and Indians across California.

07:00:17.582 --> 07:00:20.123
It is sad that the textbook have become a battleground.

07:00:20.743 --> 07:00:23.484
It is a tool to spread the political views of few people.

07:00:24.204 --> 07:00:28.585
It cannot be the place for such shrillness.

07:00:29.105 --> 07:00:38.407
We want our children to become respecting each other and not start to hate each other right from their school days.

07:00:39.327 --> 07:00:42.988
I stand here to support Geoffrey Leung and 38 other academicians.

07:00:46.209 --> 07:00:51.833
I request that the recommendations by them be accepted in all forms to solve this problem.

07:00:52.233 --> 07:00:52.553
Thank you.

07:00:55.315 --> 07:01:01.119
If there are any remaining speakers for item number 18, now would be the time to line up.

07:01:01.199 --> 07:01:01.719
Thank you.

07:01:05.782 --> 07:01:09.425
This is the last call for any speakers for item number 18.

07:01:20.385 --> 07:01:22.446
Go ahead.

07:01:24.167 --> 07:01:25.888
In the history of the State Board of Education.

07:01:35.431 --> 07:01:37.272
I didn't know I was going for a record.

07:02:04.210 --> 07:02:05.431
So, good afternoon.

07:02:05.491 --> 07:02:06.371
Is it still not up?

07:02:06.852 --> 07:02:08.393
It's on the computer.

07:02:09.273 --> 07:02:15.637
Okay.

07:02:18.001 --> 07:02:19.442
You can start without the motion.

07:02:19.823 --> 07:02:25.148
Go ahead.

07:02:25.648 --> 07:02:41.523
So I thought that I would go ahead and since it was since this morning and it's now the afternoon that I would remind the board of what we talked about this morning regarding the process that the Instructional Quality Commission conducted in order to make their recommendations to you here at the state board meeting today.

07:02:44.285 --> 07:02:55.813
A little bit further than that, when the reviewers were conducting their independent deliberations, we were then collecting all of the public comment as the independent reviewers were conducting their review.

07:02:56.233 --> 07:03:00.956
We collected those in a Box.com account and dispersed them to each individual panel.

07:03:04.139 --> 07:03:04.919
deliberations.

07:03:05.300 --> 07:03:15.950
At the week-long deliberations, the panels also received public comment twice a day during that process, went through their deliberations, came to a consensus, and developed their report of findings.

07:03:16.270 --> 07:03:21.935
The report of findings was posted on the CDE website and forwarded to the Instructional Quality Commission.

07:03:24.218 --> 07:03:31.985
and put together another Box.com account so that all public comment was there, available for everybody to see, forward that to the commissioners.

07:03:32.626 --> 07:03:40.033
On August 17th, we had a public hearing where we heard from over almost a hundred public speakers.

07:03:40.514 --> 07:03:41.815
Again, we collected public...

07:03:43.917 --> 07:03:48.542
Comment and during August 17th all the way to September 27th.

07:03:48.822 --> 07:03:59.913
We continue to Collect public comment and provide that to the commissioners so that they were fully prepared on the September 26 27th IQC meeting at the IQC meeting on September 27th the subject

07:04:04.037 --> 07:04:12.120
the public comment that they had heard from all of that, the deliberations, the public hearing, and what has been collected between the public hearing and the IQC meeting.

07:04:12.600 --> 07:04:18.681
They also looked at the report of findings from each of the panels, and publishers submitted comments as well.

07:04:19.062 --> 07:04:22.763
They took all of these pieces in consideration, so it was a unit of public comment.

07:04:24.163 --> 07:04:38.170
comment and the report of findings to determine which edits and corrections would best help the instructional materials align with the content standards and align with the framework along with the evaluation criteria adopted by the State Board of Education.

07:04:38.630 --> 07:04:41.852
So they would consider all of this data as you would say

07:04:44.093 --> 07:04:47.196
to the state board that you can see in the advisory report.

07:04:47.556 --> 07:04:54.201
So I just want to remember, remind everybody of our full process that the IQC conducted in order to make their recommendation to you today.

07:04:56.643 --> 07:04:57.824
Do you have any questions?

07:04:57.844 --> 07:04:59.145
Are there board member questions?

07:04:59.505 --> 07:04:59.926
Go ahead.

07:04:59.946 --> 07:05:06.191
I would, I think maybe our leader, Rocker, ought to lead off on these questions.

07:05:06.616 --> 07:05:06.976
Thank you.

07:05:07.716 --> 07:05:09.557
I wanted to ask just a few questions.

07:05:09.577 --> 07:05:12.638
I was taking some notes during the public comment.

07:05:13.418 --> 07:05:24.481
In public testimony and then in the written correspondence, there were repeated references to McGraw-Hill, grades six through eight, and National Geographic that require corrections.

07:05:25.161 --> 07:05:35.964
And if you'd address the rationale for proposing these materials for adoption and clarify the process for ensuring that the necessary edits and corrections will be made.

07:05:36.798 --> 07:05:47.710
Yeah, for the audience, let me just say we have two board liaisons who work with this and oversee all the technical changes.

07:05:48.331 --> 07:05:57.320
So we do this for various areas that we work in and the board member Sandoval, board member Rucker have our liaisons to

07:05:58.141 --> 07:06:01.406
get into every detail during the entire process.

07:06:04.571 --> 07:06:08.277
That's why I asked these two to begin our questioning.

07:06:08.577 --> 07:06:08.918
Go ahead.

07:06:10.265 --> 07:06:20.692
So, with McGraw-Hill and National Geographic, each of the panels, again, conducted their thorough review, and this is alignment to the content standards and to the framework and the evaluation criteria.

07:06:20.712 --> 07:06:39.145
The IQC, that needs to determine some corrections along with the public comment, and so the public comment that we heard about was also considered during the IQC's recommendations, and some of you can find even incorporated into the advisory report of the Instructional Quality Commission.

07:06:39.685 --> 07:06:51.690
So those programs and the IQC that's determined if they met the standards and the content of the framework, they found that they did along with the edits and corrections, and that was a part of their recommendation.

07:06:51.710 --> 07:07:01.675
And then the process part is that we have the 60-day timeline for all of that, for the publishers to submit their edits and corrections.

07:07:04.321 --> 07:07:14.785
It's important to state that the documents we're seeing today for the adoption only contain what are the recommended edits and corrections.

07:07:14.805 --> 07:07:23.089
We actually don't see the actual edits and corrections in the content of the drafts that are up to this point.

07:07:24.352 --> 07:07:30.735
Drafts that you see online from a link to our website are only the draft versions that the reviewers initially saw.

07:07:30.955 --> 07:07:36.798
None of the edits and corrections that are in the advisory report are reflected in the instructional materials posted.

07:07:37.058 --> 07:07:41.141
You will not see those final versions until after the edits and corrections have been verified.

07:07:41.501 --> 07:07:42.641
So that's preparing for February.

07:07:44.242 --> 07:07:48.143
actually start their own review for making adoption decisions.

07:07:48.503 --> 07:07:54.665
The content will have been edited and corrected in the published versions that will be available for purchase.

07:07:54.945 --> 07:07:55.165
Yes.

07:07:56.386 --> 07:07:57.226
Board Member Sandoval.

07:07:57.986 --> 07:07:59.806
And just one more clarifying question.

07:08:00.107 --> 07:08:05.008
We also heard repeated references to Bethulong and if you could tell us how those were considered?

07:08:05.518 --> 07:08:21.631
Absolutely, I have actually examples of four, I just picked several examples that came from the Jeffrey Long document of 925 that were incorporated into, specifically I just chose McGraw Hill, and we have several of them that have been incorporated.

07:08:24.675 --> 07:08:49.007
Phrase is to be replaced with the following historians have found many clay seals stamps statues and figurines in Harappa some of these show features that are all present in Hinduism today such as male and female figures and made meditative pose that resemble different deities as well small clay figures in traditional greeting poses Every long document and incorporated into the IQ sees edits and recommendations in their advisory report.

07:08:49.567 --> 07:08:50.408
That's just one example.

07:08:50.428 --> 07:08:50.448
I

07:08:51.260 --> 07:08:52.521
Yeah, there were other examples.

07:08:52.541 --> 07:08:53.561
Yes, I have several other examples.

07:08:53.601 --> 07:08:58.443
We're not going to go over them all today, but we did use that document for some of revisions.

07:08:58.743 --> 07:08:58.944
Yes.

07:09:00.464 --> 07:09:01.845
Other comments by the liaison?

07:09:04.275 --> 07:09:21.686
important to say, as it's been noted, this is an adoption that has gotten a lot of attention from many communities and from many, many stakeholder groups over the long course of the development, both from the framework to the actual training of the reviewers to where we come to today.

07:09:23.547 --> 07:09:41.881
It's really important to recognize the hard work of all the reviewers, all of the content, folks who did the study of these documents and these books, of the publishers who are being recommended today, who paid attention to and heard the concerns that were raised from many communities.

07:09:41.941 --> 07:09:43.943
It's also important to recognize

07:09:46.024 --> 07:10:02.434
that while this adoption is different because it's a personal history and it's not just somebody else's history, it's her story, it's his story, it's our story, this does not resolve the conflicts that many people feel are in history.

07:10:04.395 --> 07:10:09.118
That's not the purpose of our adoption is to settle all family disputes.

07:10:09.218 --> 07:10:13.901
That's not the purpose of having this, of having a, creating a curriculum.

07:10:14.321 --> 07:10:27.604
The purpose of creating the curriculum is to do what we saw modeled here, to have a dialogue, to have disagreements, to let people talk about what the issues are, why those are issues, and why they are so very personal.

07:10:28.084 --> 07:10:32.985
All throughout this conversation, both Nikki and I contributed to that conversation.

07:10:33.025 --> 07:10:43.267
We talked about how our own personal histories, our own personal dissatisfactions were with what was written in the framework and what was identified textbooks that were provided.

07:10:44.455 --> 07:10:46.396
So we shared our concerns as well.

07:10:47.537 --> 07:10:52.880
But it wasn't to share our concerns saying that we were the ones who knew or that we were the ones who truly understood.

07:10:52.900 --> 07:11:03.046
It was to make sure that we gave to the committee the charge to be responsible, to be deliberate, to be thoughtful, and not only have the criteria,

07:11:04.165 --> 07:11:24.743
and how they understood and identified who the experts were and why that expert contribution was very important to framing and to filling in the content and our true understanding about what it is that California wants the curriculum to provide and that California wants our students to get to read.

07:11:25.223 --> 07:11:36.952
So I want to make sure, again, we reiterate our thanks to all those who submitted letters, to all those who traveled many, many hours, many, many times to come here to give their one minute of testimony.

07:11:37.413 --> 07:11:43.177
While you may feel frustrated by that one minute of testimony, the publishers heard what you said.

07:11:44.358 --> 07:11:56.721
and the decisions that we're tasked to make today are informed by those many hours of single minutes of communication, of passion, of conversation, and testimony.

07:11:57.201 --> 07:12:08.264
I also want to make sure we recognize the hard work of the staff to make sure... was thoroughly done, was completely offered, and

07:12:08.624 --> 07:12:17.808
completely managed so that everyone had the appropriate opportunity to participate and did not feel ostracized or kept out or not allowed to participate.

07:12:18.288 --> 07:12:33.434
Wrangling a whole lot of folks to make sure that they could come here and be able to participate, included and felt heard, happened because we have a commitment of staff who believe in the process that we've put together to make this adoption happen.

07:12:33.914 --> 07:12:41.656
But more importantly, I'm very proud of the work that our writers have done in putting the framework together and in crafting the criteria.

07:12:42.516 --> 07:12:46.637
We will not resolve today by any action we take.

07:12:47.158 --> 07:12:54.059
But that's the good news, because it is a conversation, and it is a question, it is a debate that we should continue to live with.

07:12:54.760 --> 07:12:59.921
I want to remind you, because I heard a lot of comparisons in this debate about Martin Luther King.

07:13:00.361 --> 07:13:03.202
Martin Luther King was not the owner in our community

07:13:04.188 --> 07:13:06.410
leader that many people will quote.

07:13:06.950 --> 07:13:25.322
But more importantly, for all of those folks who have very strong beliefs and who have very strong convictions about what this curriculum is supposed to give to us, we think we've modeled the way this curriculum should be used and the way this curriculum can be developed that we started with over two years ago.

07:13:25.642 --> 07:13:30.545
So I want to thank all the stakeholders and all of the folks who were involved in this process up to this point.

07:13:32.284 --> 07:13:34.125
Board Member Sandoval, do you have any other comments?

07:13:35.886 --> 07:13:58.701
Yeah, just that I've witnessed the process from the framework revision and adoption all the way and I feel that the CDE and the SB staff, the reviewers, the thousands of members of the public have really made a profound and positive difference in the educational materials that will be available to all of our students in California.

07:13:59.362 --> 07:14:01.063
Stakeholders, thank you for using your

07:14:01.483 --> 07:14:05.226
strong.

07:14:05.326 --> 07:14:08.749
Your agile minds just to follow the process.

07:14:08.809 --> 07:14:11.131
It's so complicated and involves so many people.

07:14:12.689 --> 07:14:21.835
And just for having the will to ensure that we're fulfilling our responsibility to all of the students in California to provide educational.

07:14:24.617 --> 07:14:31.922
And this really will serve to build key understandings that our young people need to advance academically on to college and career.

07:14:32.602 --> 07:14:41.668
But we'll also go a long way to improving school climate nurture relationships between people from different backgrounds and beliefs and foster a stronger sense of.

07:14:44.290 --> 07:14:50.655
to make a motion if there are no other... Well, we have a chance now for more board member comments and observations.

07:14:50.715 --> 07:14:51.595
Board member Strauss.

07:14:52.316 --> 07:15:01.902
So, first, I just want to thank all the public who has been part of this process all the way through and for your voices and for the research that you've shared.

07:15:02.262 --> 07:15:02.663
And I think...

07:15:04.437 --> 07:15:15.665
principal parent and a now grandparent, that we want the best fair education for all of our students, and we don't want bullying for any of our students.

07:15:15.865 --> 07:15:17.526
And we share that for you.

07:15:17.626 --> 07:15:21.890
We are working very hard to create fair and well-developed materials.

07:15:24.972 --> 07:15:28.333
to invest in the teachers and the leaders who will do the work at the schools.

07:15:28.713 --> 07:15:37.158
And I think our legislature and a member record reported our last board meeting that they've invested and given us some money to help develop even more materials.

07:15:37.578 --> 07:15:44.061
But we have a commitment that teachers will get the training they need to understand what districts will understand.

07:15:44.341 --> 07:15:55.193
This is this process is not over at all And I think um, I just want to then personally thank member sandoval and member rucker for staying through the whole process All the hearings all the edits everything.

07:15:55.373 --> 07:16:01.700
Um, I think all of us so appreciate the diligence that you all have shared in this process um, and then I um

07:16:04.523 --> 07:16:16.854
I think you said it was 10,000 pages of comments and have tracked them all, have helped the members of the framework committee and the IQC go through the process.

07:16:16.894 --> 07:16:21.298
I don't think people realize always what it takes to help support this process.

07:16:24.621 --> 07:16:44.735
We just so much appreciate what the staff's role has been and it's been extensive So I just wanted to share thank that and then also let the parents know that we really hear what you're saying And we want every classroom in California to do a really good job of giving a broad and fair educational Thank you

07:16:47.029 --> 07:16:58.099
I wanted to say that this framework has a major overhaul, in part led by the California Supreme Court, concerning our civic culture and civic participation.

07:16:58.860 --> 07:17:01.782
It really, I think, will be noted nationally for

07:17:04.386 --> 07:17:08.688
people in civic participation and we certainly had a lot of people today.

07:17:09.168 --> 07:17:18.433
So this is in some ways a classic example of American civic culture and participation and the chance to be heard.

07:17:18.513 --> 07:17:21.854
So the framework has it and we had some action today.

07:17:25.176 --> 07:17:26.116
Other board comments?

07:17:27.657 --> 07:17:28.937
Board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

07:17:31.392 --> 07:17:40.117
Yes, I also want to thank all the public, the parents, and in particular the students that came to exercise their voice and civic and engage in civic engagement.

07:17:40.157 --> 07:17:41.198
This is your history.

07:17:41.278 --> 07:17:43.839
This is, so thank you for coming.

07:17:44.759 --> 07:17:54.805
You know, I think that as a parent of two young children, I also want to see my Mexican-American kids reflected value through our materials and our curriculum and our history.

07:17:54.825 --> 07:17:58.147
I want them to learn from others and I want others to learn from them.

07:17:58.687 --> 07:18:01.449
And I think it's important and I think we've all been very mindful.

07:18:01.469 --> 07:18:14.496
We want to be mindful of honoring, valuing, and portraying our religions and histories and ethnic backgrounds in the most accurate way.

07:18:14.837 --> 07:18:18.919
And I think that this process definitely seems like that is what we did.

07:18:18.939 --> 07:18:20.900
We make sure to hear by the framework.

07:18:24.142 --> 07:18:28.203
Today, we know that this is a sensitive topic because it's a personal topic.

07:18:28.243 --> 07:18:29.424
History is personal.

07:18:29.944 --> 07:18:37.287
But rest assured that many of us are very dedicated to making sure that our students, our histories are properly reflected.

07:18:37.707 --> 07:18:41.048
And so with that, I want to make sure that I don't let a comment go by.

07:18:41.068 --> 07:18:49.071
The fact that my ancestors were already here, as well as board member Sandoval's ancestors.

07:18:49.291 --> 07:18:51.572
So let's correct history and make sure that our kids know that.

07:18:51.772 --> 07:18:52.132
Thank you.

07:18:52.932 --> 07:18:56.916
And while we're correcting history, we already know Lincoln did not free the slaves.

07:18:58.397 --> 07:19:00.039
Board member Valdez.

07:19:00.455 --> 07:19:00.875
Thank you.

07:19:04.237 --> 07:19:10.921
All of the teachers who did the arduous work of taking it back to their homes, schools, or their tables and putting out all those materials.

07:19:11.262 --> 07:19:15.444
Years ago, I was on the IMAP Committee on Instructional Materials Adoption Panel.

07:19:15.464 --> 07:19:21.328
So I understand the vetting and the initial training and then the going through the adjudication and all of that.

07:19:21.348 --> 07:19:24.930
So it is a process that has to work today.

07:19:25.610 --> 07:19:27.250
I think we did make history today.

07:19:27.330 --> 07:19:32.152
And once all of these or whatever programs are approved, districts will have choice.

07:19:32.732 --> 07:19:37.633
And one of the speakers talked about, they're still talking about a precedent two terms ago.

07:19:38.093 --> 07:19:40.013
And so we need to have these materials.

07:19:40.093 --> 07:19:44.494
And I think that they're going to be very exciting.

07:19:44.874 --> 07:19:48.835
And a good framework was the foundation for the publishers to create these materials.

07:19:48.895 --> 07:19:51.856
So I thank you for your work and congratulations.

07:19:54.052 --> 07:19:54.396
Okay.

07:19:54.578 --> 07:19:55.913
I think we're ready for a motion.

07:19:57.458 --> 07:20:25.414
I move approval of the CDE's recommendation, one, to adopt the 10 instructions recommended by the Instructional Materials Commission, two, direct CDE staff in conjunction with members of the IQC and or content review experts as needed to evaluate whether publishers have made the IQC recommended edits and corrections, social content citations, and Publisher errata specified in the Instructional Materials Report to be adopted instructional materials.

07:20:26.234 --> 07:20:45.007
In the case of inconsistencies between the IQC-recommended publisher errata and the IQC-recommended edits and corrections and social content citations specified in the advisory report, the IQC-recommended edits and corrections should take precedence over the publisher errata.

07:20:45.647 --> 07:21:01.917
And third, pursuant to Education Code Section 60200E, specifically find, based on the Instructional Quality Commission Advisory Report, that fewer than five programs met the criteria for adoption in kindergarten through fifth grade.

07:21:04.358 --> 07:21:30.980
We'll second that motion and I want to make a note that the panels there were 12 panels 10 of the 12 panels of programs are being recommended the two that were not Recommended the IQC strongly agrees that they should not be recommended and by taking this To recommend those two programs as well All right any further discussion from the board I

07:21:31.621 --> 07:21:33.223
I'm pretty sure it's your hands.

07:21:34.043 --> 07:21:35.124
Carries unanimously.

07:21:35.304 --> 07:21:35.725
Thank you.

07:21:37.046 --> 07:21:46.835
We're now on to the item for SBE priorities and we're alphabetical rather than by your identification sign.

07:21:47.336 --> 07:21:49.738
Member Burr, you are at the beginning of the alphabet.

07:21:52.985 --> 07:21:54.266
My reports are finished.

07:21:55.006 --> 07:22:01.469
I did the screening committee and you heard a lot of information about the collaborative.

07:22:01.569 --> 07:22:07.432
Yes, our next collaborative is the first Thursday of December here in the department.

07:22:09.433 --> 07:22:11.214
Next is board member Holliday.

07:22:15.300 --> 07:22:15.681
Go ahead.

07:22:16.862 --> 07:22:19.224
Sorry, you caught me too quickly there.

07:22:19.985 --> 07:22:32.758
First of all, it's kind of ironic that the longest meeting we've had in years had no charter items whatsoever as part of it.

07:22:33.263 --> 07:22:37.304
But I think that's going to change for the next meeting or so, from what I hear.

07:22:38.224 --> 07:22:51.607
In terms of the Environmental Literacy Steering Committee, the committee will meet in this room again and celebrate the end of the second year of the existence of the committee.

07:22:52.187 --> 07:23:01.289
And it will also announce that the committee is working with, I think it's like,

07:23:04.910 --> 07:23:23.016
both Southern California as well as Northern California to create model plans for how environmental literacy can be infused in the LCAP process and therefore get into the classrooms and be a significant part of the entire curriculum.

07:23:24.917 --> 07:23:41.716
So the Environmental Literacy Steering Committee is hard at work making progress at the district level and I'll be updating you more in the months to come Good board member gray You're next on the

07:23:45.987 --> 07:23:48.028
Yeah.

07:23:48.068 --> 07:23:49.309
Somebody did this wrong.

07:23:49.989 --> 07:23:51.470
Yeah.

07:23:52.370 --> 07:23:54.291
Well, I'd still be happy to talk about two things.

07:23:55.492 --> 07:23:57.873
One about what I did over this past week.

07:23:57.953 --> 07:24:00.555
And also, I wanted to make a comment earlier, and I was kind of nervous.

07:24:00.575 --> 07:24:01.976
So maybe I'll make that.

07:24:04.437 --> 07:24:06.018
The SAVE conference, which was great.

07:24:06.998 --> 07:24:10.380
It was great to see student voice, student civic engagement.

07:24:11.141 --> 07:24:12.381
That's something that's just great to see.

07:24:12.401 --> 07:24:13.222
And it's great to see just

07:24:13.942 --> 07:24:39.359
the wonderful ideas that students have and are willing to offer when, you know, given the platform, as you guys I'm sure could tell you, I also got the opportunity to meet the candidates for the next year SBM position, which is a little weird because I just began the position, but you know, the kids are great, and I'm really excited for next year, I guess, even though my term just began.

07:24:39.379 --> 07:24:41.641
With that being said,

07:24:45.202 --> 07:24:46.643
the adoption of the new curriculum.

07:24:47.923 --> 07:25:00.426
As like a history nerd, history is my favorite subject, I've definitely also, you know, felt the pain and the disappointment of not always having my culture and my identity, I guess, accurately represented in the textbooks I read.

07:25:00.446 --> 07:25:10.329
And even for the process, I can say that I'm proud that I'm here today as we're adopting this.

07:25:10.609 --> 07:25:12.370
So I guess that's a little update.

07:25:12.390 --> 07:25:12.590
Yeah.

07:25:13.590 --> 07:25:13.890
Great.

07:25:14.950 --> 07:25:16.391
OK, I am next on the list.

07:25:16.511 --> 07:25:21.932
I attended a two-day conference sponsored by PACE on continuity.

07:25:22.172 --> 07:25:34.934
It was a by invitation group of, I don't know, 60 or so people, and really got into trying to grapple with it and apply it.

07:25:35.415 --> 07:25:36.215
And I learned a lot.

07:25:36.335 --> 07:25:40.616
So it was a very interesting exercise and worth my time.

07:25:45.071 --> 07:25:49.094
So you heard from board member Burr regarding the screening committee.

07:25:49.214 --> 07:25:52.476
For me, the only update is on the health education framework.

07:25:52.897 --> 07:25:55.899
The committee will be meeting November 29th and the 30th.

07:25:56.379 --> 07:26:01.383
And this is the fifth meeting, with our last one being in January, and those are open to the public.

07:26:01.763 --> 07:26:05.346
Which is now being integrated into the framework.

07:26:06.147 --> 07:26:15.796
And at this point, the Health Education Framework Committee is working to go through all the chapters and submit to the Instructional Quality Commission after the January meeting.

07:26:15.996 --> 07:26:16.997
So please stay involved.

07:26:17.177 --> 07:26:17.498
Thank you.

07:26:17.518 --> 07:26:19.740
Board Member Rucker.

07:26:24.798 --> 07:26:30.181
representative on the Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children.

07:26:30.622 --> 07:26:33.043
This is the State Council General Business Meeting.

07:26:33.403 --> 07:26:41.629
California, by an act of the legislature, created this compact to deal with issues of children who are military dependents who are

07:26:45.112 --> 07:26:48.996
are stationed at multiple military installations throughout the state of California.

07:26:49.377 --> 07:26:54.743
And so we deal with their transfer in or attendance issues.

07:26:55.063 --> 07:27:00.530
The compact meets four times a year and this was our second meeting for this schedule.

07:27:00.570 --> 07:27:02.792
Third meeting, I'm sorry, for this conversation.

07:27:05.235 --> 07:27:17.166
what to do with the federal requirements that was added with the Every Student Succeeds Act to have an identifier for students who are military dependents added to our state student data system.

07:27:17.226 --> 07:27:21.870
That is a conversation that is still ongoing and work is moving forward.

07:27:22.711 --> 07:27:41.763
I'm working with board member sound of all concerning the history social science Adoption and the front development of the curriculum and the framework having done the adoption today I'm looking forward to working with Stephanie and her unit on the next steps which include finishing up the adoption and doing the public

07:27:44.665 --> 07:27:51.953
I'll be a fly on the wall listening to some very creative people who are discussing activities and ideas for those workshops.

07:27:52.314 --> 07:28:00.203
But I do and I'm looking forward to seeing the rollouts happen and to seeing the other work that will be done to support the implementation of the frameworks.

07:28:00.803 --> 07:28:01.885
And that's all I'll do.

07:28:06.199 --> 07:28:09.281
First, California State Summer School for the Arts.

07:28:09.641 --> 07:28:14.504
On Monday, Pixar Animation Studios hosted a benefit screening of their new feature, Coco.

07:28:15.345 --> 07:28:23.530
And the California State Summer School for the Arts alum, Adrián Molina, was the screenwriter and supported the school.

07:28:24.551 --> 07:28:33.598
is going to help ensure that all admitted students are able to attend this extraordinary pre-professional program, regardless of ability to pay.

07:28:33.758 --> 07:28:36.020
So it's wonderful to have that partnership.

07:28:37.201 --> 07:28:41.324
And then related to visual and performing arts, on September 27, I mentioned Accepted 2018.

07:28:44.506 --> 07:29:00.976
Performing arts standards draft guidelines for advisors and advisors will convene early next year to work on the revision of California's visual and performing arts standards Which will be aligned to the national arts standards the Advisory Commission on special education met on October 11th and 12th and

07:29:05.318 --> 07:29:12.803
We got a summary of the work related to the preliminary education specialist credential, and that continues to be a work in progress.

07:29:13.644 --> 07:29:21.129
And commissioners offered feedback on the possible models for a changed special education credential structure.

07:29:24.751 --> 07:29:35.756
And the theme is that both general education teachers and special education teachers must be prepared to differentiate instruction and read and implement an IEP, an Individualized Education Program.

07:29:36.797 --> 07:29:44.881
And the commissioners also reviewed statewide assessment results.

07:29:45.061 --> 07:29:49.323
In math or English language arts, there was an incremental increase.

07:29:50.483 --> 07:29:56.425
And commissioners reviewed the designated supports and accommodations, learned about the CAST field test.

07:29:56.885 --> 07:30:06.208
Of particular interest is the Cognitive Lab, which is a study to determine how visually accessible versions of technology are against item types.

07:30:06.868 --> 07:30:12.790
And then LPAC Cognitive Labs will evaluate accessibility of items for blind or deaf student populations.

07:30:13.950 --> 07:30:36.441
Then just a final note from the Advisory Commission on special education the commissioners have a great interest in the health framework discussions In all grade levels, so I just wanted to bring that Forward just to always I'm sure I know you have that in mind too, but I just wanted to make that that point Thank you.

07:30:36.461 --> 07:30:38.602
Hey board member Strauss.

07:30:38.622 --> 07:30:38.642
I

07:30:39.192 --> 07:30:42.713
So I just wanted to talk about a CTC event.

07:30:42.773 --> 07:30:45.514
And they did quite a bit of talk.

07:30:45.774 --> 07:30:49.316
They're using a dashboard like we're trying to, we're developing our dashboard.

07:30:49.336 --> 07:30:54.618
And they're looking at lots of data around teachers and how long they stay and their passing scores.

07:30:54.658 --> 07:31:01.960
And they actually did a whole standard setting on their new science test, which is aligned to the Next Generation Science Test.

07:31:02.180 --> 07:31:03.241
And it's something to talk about.

07:31:04.601 --> 07:31:06.523
are saying they revised their cut scores.

07:31:07.003 --> 07:31:10.826
So it's just alignment to the similar kind of new test and trying to get it aligned.

07:31:10.846 --> 07:31:13.367
They are having problems with people passing the physics test.

07:31:13.387 --> 07:31:16.970
So as we look at science implementation, we'll probably have to think about that.

07:31:17.010 --> 07:31:21.973
Also, there was quite a bit of discussion about a child development permit with a lot of concerns.

07:31:24.455 --> 07:31:40.163
education teacher field, they're experiencing a huge shortage in preschool teachers as well, and kind of looking to make the coursework more rigorous and structure it, but also worried about getting people into the field teaching preschool before they come to us.

07:31:41.203 --> 07:31:42.704
As far as last week,

07:31:44.525 --> 07:31:45.646
It's their second one they've done.

07:31:45.666 --> 07:31:46.707
It was wonderful.

07:31:46.807 --> 07:31:48.568
It had 300 or 400 people there.

07:31:48.588 --> 07:31:54.032
They had wonderful sessions, both by people who worked on the framework, some of our CDE staff on ethnic studies.

07:31:54.333 --> 07:31:55.353
Tom Adams and I were there.

07:31:55.373 --> 07:32:00.497
It was a wonderful, wonderful energetic, but we have lots of work to do, we know, in rolling out history.

07:32:04.624 --> 07:32:17.110
Those are about 100 people from around the regions of California that are building capacity in math and science so that they can go back to their regions and help do professional development.

07:32:17.910 --> 07:32:32.097
They're having a separate meeting now to make sure that all the regions of California where people have lots of work to do, as you know, with our math scores and the needing to build capacity for teachers, and we will as we continue to move forward in science.

07:32:33.419 --> 07:32:35.360
On Monday, I was on accountability.

07:32:35.400 --> 07:32:37.401
I was in Santa Cruz meeting with the counselors.

07:32:37.841 --> 07:32:39.542
And I just wanted to highlight one piece.

07:32:39.582 --> 07:32:45.685
Santa Cruz did their first summit for... Riverside County.

07:32:46.065 --> 07:32:53.769
But as we've been talking about multi-tiered systems of student support and instruction, they're talking about multi-tiered systems of student support for counselors.

07:32:54.149 --> 07:33:00.393
And so that concept of what we do for all kids, what we do for some, and what we do for a few, I think we'll carry through in our theme.

07:33:00.693 --> 07:33:01.513
I wanted to highlight that.

07:33:01.553 --> 07:33:01.753
And then...

07:33:05.055 --> 07:33:06.155
in Santa Barbara Unified.

07:33:06.175 --> 07:33:08.275
That's a larger unified district.

07:33:09.096 --> 07:33:12.317
We also have a state steering committee on standards implementation.

07:33:12.337 --> 07:33:19.419
That's a small group, CDE, state board, and CESSA, the county office, taking a look at what we need to do.

07:33:19.479 --> 07:33:22.940
And we also, in addition, are looking at a line of how to communicate.

07:33:24.660 --> 07:33:26.281
quite a bit about the social-emotional learning.

07:33:26.301 --> 07:33:27.421
You're going to hear more about that.

07:33:27.721 --> 07:33:29.382
We have a committee working on that as well.

07:33:30.342 --> 07:33:33.043
And the last thing, talking about civic engagement.

07:33:33.083 --> 07:33:34.604
Last Friday, PACCRES met.

07:33:34.624 --> 07:33:39.486
That's the group that works authentic assessment for college, career, and civic readiness.

07:33:39.826 --> 07:33:42.567
And they're spending a lot of time looking at civic practices.

07:33:44.748 --> 07:33:46.069
Authentic engagement.

07:33:46.089 --> 07:33:59.553
I think we'll hear a lot more about that as we do continue to roll out in the history framework But there's a think group that's working with state board and CDE and county people thinking about this along with some researchers So that ends my report.

07:33:59.753 --> 07:34:00.914
Thank you board member Sun

07:34:04.251 --> 07:34:05.632
committee is still new.

07:34:05.652 --> 07:34:07.734
We're not even a year old yet.

07:34:08.475 --> 07:34:22.887
And so thus far in the last four meetings, we've explored various topics like data across systems and opportunities for data sharing, successful career training programs across the state, and various agencies supporting career guidance programs.

07:34:24.688 --> 07:34:38.417
is that all of these disparate entities, programs that have launched over the past decade or so to address preparation of students for careers is starting to form partnerships, some regionally, some at the state level.

07:34:38.838 --> 07:34:41.439
So we're seeing a lot more collaboration among

07:34:44.209 --> 07:34:46.852
The bad news is that we still have a long ways to go.

07:34:47.753 --> 07:34:50.557
So the systems still do not speak to each other.

07:34:50.937 --> 07:34:53.420
The data systems don't speak to each other.

07:34:53.820 --> 07:34:55.683
We're using different vocabulary.

07:34:56.143 --> 07:34:59.006
There's a lack of knowledge about other institutions.

07:34:59.527 --> 07:35:01.289
So we've discovered that and we've

07:35:04.673 --> 07:35:22.945
Support for instance the CCI and I'm not sure that we've got those aligned either So there's still a lot more work for us to do We've been on a reconnaissance mission over our last four meetings and we are looking moving now towards some policy meeting Board member Valdez

07:35:29.747 --> 07:35:30.588
Okay, I'll bring it home.

07:35:32.209 --> 07:35:38.413
I have represented the board at a joint meeting, and I think it's the third time in 20 years that they all came together.

07:35:38.493 --> 07:35:41.836
So it was the executive director of the California Teaching Commission.

07:35:46.839 --> 07:35:57.644
University California and Cal State Universities as well as private colleges come together and a big topic that day had to be with a special ed Certification and and really was about recruitment and what's happening.

07:35:58.024 --> 07:36:01.586
How does our accountability system impact the candidates that are coming into?

07:36:04.528 --> 07:36:08.311
the workforce and get more quality teachers in place.

07:36:08.371 --> 07:36:21.021
So that was exciting and it was a great opportunity and just nice to see that they're all together and talking and it really looks at that continued articulation and the vertical articulation, if you will, is happening.

07:36:24.564 --> 07:36:39.411
The first one that they've ever had and so that was a good opportunity to really meet and talk about the needs of special ed I have a special ed background and I think that's something that is Lots to happen and especially with the Teaching Commission and looking at credentialing for teachers.

07:36:39.732 --> 07:36:52.778
So those are the two things I was involved in Public comment General public comment is there anybody for that on items not on our agenda

07:36:55.140 --> 07:36:55.901
We are checking.

07:36:56.001 --> 07:36:59.223
Any members for public comment, please step to the podium.

07:37:01.185 --> 07:37:08.591
We just called... While we're waiting for that, could I make one statement?

07:37:08.611 --> 07:37:11.254
These are for items that are not on our regular agenda.

07:37:11.294 --> 07:37:13.295
Were you... I hope we were clear on that.

07:37:13.876 --> 07:37:18.920
If you're speaking on an item that was on our agenda, then your chance is gone.

07:37:21.022 --> 07:37:21.262
Okay.

07:37:31.519 --> 07:37:50.741
worldwide and the thing is you know in India many languages are taught when you're small when your brains are developing not when you reach the high school so if you have languages then what happens is when speaking Sanskrit it's like brain waves you know you can study other things better for kids and adults

07:37:51.221 --> 07:37:57.386
So by just teaching English, you lost the age from 10 to 15 years when they reach high school, when the brains are developing.

07:37:57.426 --> 07:38:05.573
So I would suggest that in your language forum, you look at, you know, promoting, teaching, teaching Sanskrit and all that.

07:38:05.593 --> 07:38:11.918
So the whole thing about Vedic mathematics and Sanskrit, you know, think about it, you know, it's like leapfrogging your consciousness, I feel.

07:38:12.318 --> 07:38:12.618
Thank you.

07:38:14.139 --> 07:38:16.001
Okay, that concludes the public comment.

07:38:16.161 --> 07:38:17.742
We have no signups for public comment.

07:38:17.762 --> 07:38:18.263
Okay, thank you.

07:38:18.363 --> 07:38:19.444
All right, the board is adjourned.
