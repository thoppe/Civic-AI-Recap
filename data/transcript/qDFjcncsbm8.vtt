00:00.000 --> 00:09.920
Good morning, everybody, and welcome to the second day of the California State Board meeting.

00:09.920 --> 00:13.800
Seeing that all board members are present, Executive Director Allen, would you please

00:13.800 --> 00:17.360
call the roll to establish a quorum?

00:17.360 --> 00:18.360

Member Rucker.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.200
Here.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.200
Vice President Strauss.

00:36.200 --> 00:37.200
Here.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.200
Member Son.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.200
Here.

00:39.200 --> 00:40.200
Member Quillan.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.200
Here.

00:41.200 --> 00:42.200
Member Gabbard.

00:42.200 --> 00:43.200
Here.

00:43.200 --> 00:44.200
Member Williams.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.200
Here.

00:45.200 --> 00:46.200
Member Jim.

00:46.200 --> 00:47.200
Here.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.200
Member Johnson.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.200
Here.

00:49.200 --> 00:50.200
Member Gabbard.

00:50.200 --> 00:51.200
Here.

00:51.200 --> 00:52.200
Member Williams.

00:52.200 --> 00:53.200
Here.

00:53.200 --> 00:54.400
You have a quorum.

00:55.640 --> 00:56.920
Thank you.

00:56.920 --> 00:58.840
So reporting at a closed session,

00:58.840 --> 01:00.560
the Board discussed or took action

01:00.560 --> 01:02.920
on the following legal matters,

01:02.920 --> 01:07.920
Kayla J. versus State and Carrie K. versus State.

01:07.920 --> 01:10.080
So today I have some general announcements.

01:11.160 --> 01:14.960
Members of the public wishing to dial in for public comment

01:14.960 --> 01:16.960
should view the live stream of the meeting

01:16.960 --> 01:20.800
to know at what time we'll be asking for public comment

01:20.800 --> 01:22.760
on the agenda items.

01:22.760 --> 01:25.880
Public comment will be provided by dialing the phone number

01:25.880 --> 01:28.320
and participant access code

01:28.320 --> 01:32.080
and then following each of the operator's prompts.

01:32.080 --> 01:33.680
When you are dialing in,

01:33.680 --> 01:36.800
the callers will be added to a caller queue.

01:36.800 --> 01:38.880
The operator will notify callers

01:38.880 --> 01:42.080
when it's their turn to provide public comment.

01:42.080 --> 01:44.480
We're gonna also ask you as the public,

01:44.480 --> 01:46.920
when you call in for public comment,

01:46.920 --> 01:50.040
please turn down your speaker volume of your computer

01:50.040 --> 01:52.240
if you're following us on the live feed

01:52.240 --> 01:53.640
so that we don't get the echo effect

01:53.640 --> 01:55.440
and then we'll be able to hear your public comment

01:55.440 --> 01:57.360
that you've waited to give us.

01:57.360 --> 01:58.760
And Board members, we're reminding you

01:58.760 --> 02:01.400
to mute your microphones when you're not speaking

02:01.400 --> 02:03.440
and keep your cameras on as much as possible

02:03.440 --> 02:05.960
to ensure we maintain a quorum

02:05.960 --> 02:08.240
throughout today's virtual meeting.

02:08.240 --> 02:10.040
For each item, there'll be an opportunity

02:10.040 --> 02:11.600
for Board members to raise your hand

02:11.600 --> 02:13.880
using the Zoom participant window

02:13.880 --> 02:16.800
if you'd like to make a comment or ask a question.

02:18.120 --> 02:20.800
Today we are taking item 11.

02:21.760 --> 02:25.560
Item 11 is a public hearing regarding a petition

02:25.560 --> 02:27.160
for the renewal of a charter school

02:27.160 --> 02:28.800
currently under the oversight

02:28.800 --> 02:30.720
of the State Board of Education

02:30.720 --> 02:33.720
pursuant to California Education Code 47605.9B,

02:37.200 --> 02:41.040
consideration of PrepaTech Los Angeles High,

02:41.040 --> 02:45.200
which was denied by the Los Angeles Unified School District.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.680
The CDE recommends that the State Board

02:47.680 --> 02:50.480
hold a public hearing to deny the request

02:50.480 --> 02:53.280
to renew PrepaTech Los Angeles High,

02:53.280 --> 02:55.960
a grade nine through 12 charter school

02:55.960 --> 02:58.560
based on the CDE findings pursuant

02:58.560 --> 03:03.280
to California Ed Code section 47605,

03:03.280 --> 03:08.280
47605.9, 47607E, 47607.2B,

03:10.840 --> 03:12.960
and California Ed Code of Regulations

03:12.960 --> 03:16.840
Title V, section 119675.

03:16.840 --> 03:20.160
This item will be presented by Stephanie Farland

03:20.160 --> 03:21.560
from CDE.

03:21.560 --> 03:23.720
Stephanie, I turn it over to you.

03:23.720 --> 03:24.840
You may begin.

03:24.840 --> 03:25.680
Thank you.

03:26.520 --> 03:27.360
Thank you.

03:29.440 --> 03:31.920
Good morning, Vice President Strauss,

03:31.920 --> 03:36.120
members of the Board, Deputy Superintendent Gregson.

03:37.520 --> 03:42.520
Today we are going to hear the appeal of the renewal

03:47.080 --> 03:49.440
for PrepaTech Los Angeles High School.

03:51.160 --> 03:55.040
So PrepaTech Los Angeles High School

03:55.040 --> 04:00.040
is operated by, let me get my screen right here,

04:00.320 --> 04:04.880
so I can see, is operated by Alta Public Schools,

04:06.680 --> 04:08.440
a charter management organization

04:08.440 --> 04:10.760
that also operates two other schools

04:10.760 --> 04:14.720
within the LAUSD Los Angeles Unified School District.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.480
PrepaTech is seeking authorization

04:18.680 --> 04:20.240
from the State Board of Education

04:20.240 --> 04:23.200
to renew their grade nine through 12 charter school

04:23.200 --> 04:25.720
within the boundaries of LAUSD.

04:25.720 --> 04:29.960
The petitioners initially saw authorization from LAUSD,

04:29.960 --> 04:32.000
and on December 9th, 2020,

04:32.000 --> 04:34.840
LAUSD denied the petitioner's request for renewal

04:34.840 --> 04:37.600
by a vote of five to zero.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.440
The petitioners submitted their petition

04:39.440 --> 04:41.040
to the California Department of Ed

04:41.040 --> 04:44.080
on appeal on January 8th, 2021.

04:44.080 --> 04:47.080
Today, this Department of Education is recommending

04:47.080 --> 04:48.840
that the State Board hold a public hearing

04:48.840 --> 04:51.840
and deny the request to renew PTLAH,

04:53.840 --> 04:56.320
a grade nine through 12 charter school.

04:56.320 --> 04:59.040
At the April 13th, 2021 meeting,

04:59.040 --> 05:02.480
the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools, ACCS,

05:02.480 --> 05:06.360
voted unanimously in favor of the CDE's recommendation

05:06.360 --> 05:09.600
to deny renewal of PTLAH.

05:10.360 --> 05:12.680
The first time the ACCS has voted unanimously

05:12.680 --> 05:16.160
in favor of denial, at least in the last several years.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.720
Pursuant to Ed Code 47605.9B,

05:23.720 --> 05:26.360
if the State Board chooses to grant renewal

05:26.360 --> 05:29.600
of the petition pursuant to 47607,

05:29.600 --> 05:32.600
the State Board shall designate in consultation

05:32.600 --> 05:34.600
with the petitioner, either the governing board

05:34.600 --> 05:37.360
of the school district or the Board of Education,

05:37.560 --> 05:38.640
in which a charter school is located

05:38.640 --> 05:39.960
as the chartering authority.

05:41.160 --> 05:43.600
If approved by the SBE today,

05:43.600 --> 05:47.400
the CDE is recommending that LAUSD be designated

05:47.400 --> 05:49.400
as the chartering authority.

05:50.600 --> 05:54.560
I do want to note that we did consult with the charter school

05:54.560 --> 05:59.560
and they did request that the LA County Office of Education

06:00.560 --> 06:04.560
be there authorized to approve the charter school.

06:05.560 --> 06:10.080
Be there authorizer, should the State Board approve.

06:11.360 --> 06:14.760
The department did have a discussion,

06:14.760 --> 06:16.880
we are required to consult with them,

06:16.880 --> 06:21.880
but felt that because LAUSD already has two other,

06:21.920 --> 06:25.440
of the ALTA public school schools within their oversight,

06:25.440 --> 06:27.400
that it made more sense for this school

06:27.400 --> 06:30.360
to be under LAUSD as oversight,

06:30.360 --> 06:34.360
especially as most of the recommendation today

06:35.160 --> 06:36.320
is based on fiscal concerns.

06:40.480 --> 06:43.560
The educational program of PREPATEC,

06:43.560 --> 06:46.920
the mission of PTLAH is to provide a real-class education

06:46.920 --> 06:48.520
to every student through an inquiry

06:48.520 --> 06:51.360
and investigation school model that will prepare students

06:51.360 --> 06:54.280
to meet the challenges of a global 21st century.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.320
PTLAH is an authorized public

06:56.320 --> 07:00.440
international baccalaureate diploma program school in LAUSD,

07:00.440 --> 07:02.680
which affords pupils the opportunity and access

07:02.680 --> 07:05.440
to a small, rigorous high school in their neighborhood.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.240
The 2019-20 school year was the first year

07:12.240 --> 07:15.560
11th graders participated in the two-year IB program

07:15.560 --> 07:20.560
at PREPATEC at the end of this year, 2020-21 school year,

07:21.840 --> 07:24.240
PTLAH will have their first group of pupils

07:24.240 --> 07:26.280
eligible to receive the IB diploma.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.280
The CDE's findings and concerns.

07:33.280 --> 07:36.280
The department was unable to determine if PTLAH

07:36.280 --> 07:39.080
met the applicable academic renewal criteria

07:39.080 --> 07:44.080
pursuant to Ed Code 47607B based on California assessment

07:44.080 --> 07:46.960
of student performance and progress, CASP, scores,

07:46.960 --> 07:49.480
as a charter school only has one year of data

07:49.480 --> 07:51.280
and does not report any colors

07:51.280 --> 07:54.280
of the student performance and progress assessment

07:54.280 --> 07:56.360
data and does not report any colors

07:56.360 --> 07:59.000
on the California school dashboard.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.200
The year we have, as it is for most schools,

08:03.200 --> 08:08.200
2018-19 on CASP, 25% met exceeded standards in ELA

08:08.200 --> 08:11.480
and 3% met or exceeded standards in math.

08:11.480 --> 08:13.240
It is a high school, so as you remember,

08:13.240 --> 08:15.120
they only test 11th graders.

08:16.120 --> 08:19.600
So it did take a couple of years to get to a point

08:19.600 --> 08:22.400
where they could test and this is the only year we have.

08:24.920 --> 08:27.920
The CDE also reviewed the following verified data

08:27.920 --> 08:30.320
that the petitioner included and provided

08:30.320 --> 08:32.080
as criteria for charter renewal.

08:32.080 --> 08:34.920
The California dashboard data for ELA math,

08:34.920 --> 08:37.120
chronic absenteeism rates, suspension rates,

08:37.120 --> 08:39.720
and English learner progress indicators.

08:39.720 --> 08:44.720
They also submitted Northwest Education Association,

08:44.960 --> 08:48.360
NWEA measurable academic progress data,

08:48.360 --> 08:51.640
so map data, so we do have that included in the item.

08:51.640 --> 08:54.640
In terms of their dashboard data,

08:54.640 --> 08:58.640
remember there are no colors because they only had a year,

08:58.640 --> 09:00.960
but the 2019 California school dashboard

09:00.960 --> 09:02.840
reflects their performance

09:02.840 --> 09:05.840
under California's accountability system as follows.

09:05.840 --> 09:08.640
ELA is 65 points below standard

09:08.640 --> 09:12.640
and math was 169.8 points below standard.

09:12.640 --> 09:14.640
The ELA dashboard is a high school,

09:14.640 --> 09:17.640
so it does not report any colors of the student performance

09:17.640 --> 09:20.640
and does not report any colors of the student performance.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.640
ELA is 65.8 points below standard.

09:23.840 --> 09:26.320
Are you hearing feedback from my microphone?

09:27.640 --> 09:29.840
Okay, I'm just hearing it then.

09:29.840 --> 09:31.520
I hear myself being repeated.

09:34.400 --> 09:39.400
California school chronic absenteeism graduation rates.

09:39.720 --> 09:42.320
The dashboard does not show chronic absenteeism rates

09:42.320 --> 09:44.520
for PTLH because it is a high school.

09:44.520 --> 09:47.040
Don't gather that information for high schools.

09:47.040 --> 09:49.560
The California school dashboard didn't,

09:49.560 --> 09:52.520
also does not show graduation rates for PTLH

09:52.520 --> 09:55.560
as it did not have a graduating class until 2020.

10:02.440 --> 10:05.400
As far as suspension rates,

10:05.400 --> 10:10.400
in 2018 they had 6.5%, which put them in the red,

10:10.840 --> 10:14.680
but they did improve significantly in 2019,

10:14.680 --> 10:18.760
moving to blue in one year.

10:19.560 --> 10:24.560
The 2019 California school dashboard was the first year

10:29.000 --> 10:30.680
the LP was reported.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.880
The LP is calculated based on a student's performance

10:35.880 --> 10:37.840
on the English language proficiency assessments

10:37.840 --> 10:39.600
for California, the LPAC.

10:39.600 --> 10:44.000
The data for the 2019 LP shows that 43% of PTLH

10:44.000 --> 10:45.920
English learner pupils are making progress

10:45.920 --> 10:48.200
towards English language proficiency.

10:49.560 --> 10:54.560
In terms of the NWEA map data for reading an ELA,

11:01.400 --> 11:03.880
if you remember from yesterday, reading an ELA,

11:03.880 --> 11:06.200
we're in two separate slides.

11:06.200 --> 11:10.040
So we take the data and the assessment data

11:10.040 --> 11:12.520
that the school provides us,

11:12.520 --> 11:16.960
and the school provided us with reading an ELA combined.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.920
So it may look a little different than yesterday.

11:19.920 --> 11:24.920
This is a winter to winter NWEA ELA four year comparison

11:25.760 --> 11:27.200
for the class of 2020.

11:29.680 --> 11:34.680
And you can see that in some areas they went up,

11:35.360 --> 11:40.360
in some areas they maintained their scores.

11:40.760 --> 11:45.760
And these are scale scores for overall student progress

11:48.960 --> 11:50.040
towards mastery.

11:53.760 --> 11:56.320
And then the next slide is there,

11:56.320 --> 12:01.320
and oh, go, thank you, NWEA map data, this is math.

12:04.400 --> 12:08.760
And again, you can see they stayed pretty constant.

12:10.360 --> 12:15.360
English learner progress indicator,

12:17.360 --> 12:20.720
these are LPAC results in percentages.

12:20.720 --> 12:24.280
38% progressed at least one level.

12:24.280 --> 12:28.880
4.7 maintained their level four designation.

12:28.880 --> 12:33.640
33% maintained their level one through three H designation

12:33.640 --> 12:38.640
and 23.8% decreased at least one level,

12:39.160 --> 12:43.320
which comes out to about 57% maintaining or decreasing.

12:52.600 --> 12:55.240
So the department's findings and concerns

12:57.080 --> 12:58.560
specific to fiscal.

13:01.160 --> 13:04.280
So there has been communication regarding fiscal concerns

13:04.280 --> 13:06.880
over the life of this petition.

13:06.920 --> 13:11.680
As stated before, it is an SB authorized school.

13:11.680 --> 13:15.000
So has been under the oversight of the department

13:16.040 --> 13:19.200
and the state board for the last several years.

13:19.200 --> 13:21.640
It is noted that over the course of its oversight,

13:21.640 --> 13:24.840
the SBE has issued five letters to prep attack

13:24.840 --> 13:27.680
outline the following fiscal concerns,

13:27.680 --> 13:30.640
negative fund balances, no reserves.

13:30.640 --> 13:34.000
Although prep attack has responded to all letters

13:34.000 --> 13:35.920
of concern with seemingly sound plans

13:35.960 --> 13:37.200
to address fiscal issues,

13:37.200 --> 13:39.440
the school has remained in poor financial condition

13:39.440 --> 13:41.760
throughout the term of its current charter.

13:41.760 --> 13:46.000
So there were five letters of concern

13:46.000 --> 13:48.200
that were sent to prep attack

13:48.200 --> 13:50.480
over the course of its current charter.

13:53.080 --> 13:55.480
And although they responded every year,

13:55.480 --> 14:00.480
they were back on sort of the fiscal concern list

14:01.880 --> 14:05.080
and have stayed on there.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.320
The annual reports that the board gets

14:08.320 --> 14:10.400
of all of its SBE charters every year

14:10.400 --> 14:14.200
regarding academic and fiscal health,

14:14.200 --> 14:17.480
they have been on the poor fiscal list

14:17.480 --> 14:20.440
for the entirety of their petition.

14:27.960 --> 14:31.280
PTLAH has a poor financial records,

14:31.280 --> 14:33.960
it's approval in 2016.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.240
The prep attack's fiscal year 2021,

14:36.240 --> 14:38.520
second interim report dated March 15th

14:38.520 --> 14:40.640
indicates that PTLAH is projecting

14:40.640 --> 14:44.200
a negative ending fund balance of 322,000.

14:45.200 --> 14:48.040
The fiscal year 2019-20 audit report

14:48.040 --> 14:49.920
reflected an unqualified status

14:49.920 --> 14:51.400
with a negative ending fund balance

14:51.400 --> 14:54.880
of 423,000 with a zero percent reserve.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.600
And just so as we're kind of going through this,

15:01.960 --> 15:06.960
and I often need to sort of relearn this

15:07.360 --> 15:10.560
every time we talk about fiscal and budget issues,

15:10.560 --> 15:12.320
that there is a difference between

15:12.320 --> 15:14.480
ending fund balance and ending cash balance,

15:14.480 --> 15:16.000
and we're gonna talk about both of those.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.840
Ending fund balance is the net asset,

15:17.840 --> 15:19.560
so the difference between total assets

15:19.560 --> 15:21.560
and total liabilities.

15:21.560 --> 15:23.720
The formula is beginning fund balance

15:23.720 --> 15:26.960
plus or minus operating surplus or operating deficit.

15:26.960 --> 15:29.880
Ending cash balance of a cash flow statement

15:29.920 --> 15:32.280
equals the cash amount shown on the balance sheet.

15:32.280 --> 15:34.840
Cash flow is the change in the charter school's cash

15:34.840 --> 15:36.440
from one period to the next.

15:40.720 --> 15:44.600
So pursuant to Ed Code 47607E,

15:44.600 --> 15:47.600
and this is something that was implemented post 1505,

15:47.600 --> 15:50.280
this is part of AP 1505 legislation,

15:50.280 --> 15:52.920
the CVE provided notice to Prepatech

15:52.920 --> 15:55.880
of its findings that Prepatech is demonstrably unlikely

15:55.880 --> 15:57.640
to successfully implement the program

15:57.640 --> 15:59.320
set forth in its petition

15:59.360 --> 16:02.560
due to the following substantial fiscal factors.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.600
Prepatech reported a 0% reserve

16:04.600 --> 16:07.840
in the 2021 first interim report,

16:07.840 --> 16:11.720
and per PTLAH's memorandum of understanding

16:11.720 --> 16:12.880
with the state board,

16:12.880 --> 16:16.640
Prepatech is to maintain a reserve of 5%.

16:16.640 --> 16:18.920
Prepatech reported a negative ending fund balance

16:18.920 --> 16:23.600
of 274,000 in the fiscal year 2021 first interim report.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.600
They were given an offer, it's a 30-day notice,

16:26.600 --> 16:29.560
so they were given an opportunity to correct,

16:29.560 --> 16:34.080
to submit a cure and correct, submit corrective actions.

16:36.480 --> 16:38.520
As of October 31, 2020,

16:38.520 --> 16:42.480
Prepatech's net assets are negative 952,241

16:42.480 --> 16:44.840
and their debt ratio is 2.34,

16:44.840 --> 16:47.840
which means that PTLAH's total liabilities

16:47.840 --> 16:49.480
are approximately 2,000.

16:49.480 --> 16:51.600
So they were given an opportunity

16:51.600 --> 16:52.560
to cover its total liabilities

16:52.560 --> 16:55.760
are approximately two times the value of its total assets.

16:55.760 --> 16:58.880
Furthermore, PTLAH's working capital ratio

16:58.880 --> 17:02.880
would drop to 0.18, which means that they have,

17:02.880 --> 17:04.120
they would have no current assets

17:04.120 --> 17:06.080
to cover its current liabilities.

17:09.920 --> 17:13.800
They did respond on April 2nd to our 30-day notice.

17:13.800 --> 17:17.840
The fiscal corrective action plan provided by Prepatech

17:17.840 --> 17:20.200
contained three main plans

17:20.240 --> 17:22.160
to address the negative ending fund balances,

17:22.160 --> 17:26.640
receipt of the payroll protection program loan of 470,000,

17:26.640 --> 17:29.600
applying for COVID-19 relief funding

17:29.600 --> 17:31.760
and increasing student enrollment.

17:31.760 --> 17:34.360
Additionally, PTLAH noted that it expects

17:34.360 --> 17:39.360
to increase its reserve to 5% by 21-22.

17:44.840 --> 17:47.400
The CVE's analysis of their response,

17:47.400 --> 17:50.880
we reviewed all the information submitted to PTLAH,

17:50.880 --> 17:53.720
by PTLAH in response to 30-day notice.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.520
We acknowledged that they tried improving

17:56.520 --> 17:58.640
its fiscal condition and its updated

17:58.640 --> 18:00.760
multi-year financial plan reflects

18:00.760 --> 18:04.040
a projected positive ending fund balance of 165

18:04.040 --> 18:08.960
for fiscal year 2021 with a reserve of 2.9%.

18:08.960 --> 18:12.840
However, they still failed to meet the required 5%

18:12.840 --> 18:14.880
outlined in its MOU.

18:14.880 --> 18:17.200
They have not maintained the 5% in its reserves

18:18.000 --> 18:18.840
since its inception.

18:18.840 --> 18:21.760
A big piece of how they're trying to improve

18:21.760 --> 18:24.960
their fiscal condition really was their PPP loan,

18:26.680 --> 18:31.320
which provides them some cushion for the next year,

18:31.320 --> 18:32.840
for the next couple of years.

18:39.440 --> 18:41.480
In addition, Prepatech relies heavily

18:41.480 --> 18:46.160
on short-term financing to the tune of 646,000

18:46.200 --> 18:49.040
in fiscal year 2021 to cover a cash shortage

18:49.040 --> 18:51.760
regarding repayment of the short-term financing.

18:51.760 --> 18:56.200
It appears that PTLAH may incur a high financing cost

18:56.200 --> 18:57.920
with factoring, adding an additional

18:57.920 --> 18:59.880
negative effect to their budget.

18:59.880 --> 19:02.400
The CDE concludes that although the response

19:02.400 --> 19:04.240
partially remedied some of the violations

19:04.240 --> 19:06.000
noted in the CVE's letter,

19:07.880 --> 19:12.880
they still are projected to have some issues

19:13.280 --> 19:18.120
with the 5% outlined in its MOU of reserve

19:18.120 --> 19:20.320
and quite frankly failed to provide

19:20.320 --> 19:22.440
any long-term fiscal structural changes

19:22.440 --> 19:24.240
that will prevent the school from experiencing

19:24.240 --> 19:27.440
similar fiscal deficiencies in future years.

19:27.440 --> 19:32.440
As I said before, the PPP loan really was something

19:35.040 --> 19:36.680
that they relied on in this budget

19:36.680 --> 19:41.680
to in their response letter sort of get them over the hump,

19:41.840 --> 19:44.080
but they've not made any changes structurally.

19:44.080 --> 19:46.040
And we've seen over the last five years

19:46.040 --> 19:51.040
that we've sent many response letters of concern

19:51.080 --> 19:56.080
and still they have fallen short fiscally.

20:01.400 --> 20:06.240
So we did, and you probably hopefully saw it

20:06.240 --> 20:10.880
because in your documents that you received,

20:11.880 --> 20:15.760
but the school did submit a new budget

20:15.760 --> 20:17.360
just a couple of days ago.

20:19.160 --> 20:23.640
And although it was very, very last minute,

20:23.640 --> 20:27.520
we tried to go through it and see if there were any changes.

20:27.520 --> 20:32.520
Mind you that this is a budget that LAUSD did not see

20:33.280 --> 20:38.280
nor did ACCS and there were some unexplained differences

20:38.840 --> 20:43.840
in this fiscal plan that we couldn't explain,

20:48.280 --> 20:50.880
there weren't explanations attached to it.

20:50.880 --> 20:54.760
So some of the discrepancies we have here,

20:54.760 --> 20:56.320
and this is just a difference

20:56.320 --> 20:58.280
between the report they turned in this week

20:58.280 --> 21:02.560
and the report from March that went to the ACCS.

21:02.560 --> 21:06.040
Their enrollment changed a little bit, it went up 22.

21:06.080 --> 21:11.080
I'm not really sure how or why their federal funding

21:11.080 --> 21:13.160
from the March report to the May report

21:13.160 --> 21:15.920
went up almost a little over half a million dollars

21:15.920 --> 21:18.640
and there's no explanation as to why that is.

21:19.600 --> 21:24.600
Local funding went down, professional consulting fees,

21:25.960 --> 21:30.960
that minus 142,000 is a one-time reduction

21:31.240 --> 21:32.880
in their payment to their central office.

21:32.880 --> 21:35.720
So a one-time reduction in the payment

21:35.720 --> 21:38.360
they normally give to all two public schools.

21:40.200 --> 21:45.200
They're not, I'm guessing not paying it once,

21:47.240 --> 21:49.960
maybe in the coming year or this year,

21:49.960 --> 21:54.360
I'm not sure about which year that that reflects.

21:54.360 --> 21:56.800
And then their payment on debt,

21:56.800 --> 22:00.000
they had an additional 12,000 dollars

22:00.040 --> 22:04.720
they had initially projected a $58,000 payment in March

22:04.720 --> 22:09.000
and now they're projecting a $457,000 payment.

22:09.960 --> 22:14.960
Not clear where that 400,000 difference is coming from.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.400
So there were some differences

22:19.400 --> 22:21.440
and I'm sure that they'll be able

22:21.440 --> 22:22.760
to answer questions on this,

22:22.760 --> 22:26.080
but it was not clear in what they submitted to us

22:26.080 --> 22:28.520
how some of these changes have come about

22:29.440 --> 22:33.760
or whether they're long-term structural changes

22:33.760 --> 22:35.600
or just one-time changes.

22:37.480 --> 22:38.320
Next slide.

22:39.800 --> 22:41.920
Additional fiscal concerns.

22:41.920 --> 22:44.720
As I've said, since its inception,

22:44.720 --> 22:47.560
Prepatech has demonstrated poor financial management

22:47.560 --> 22:50.760
and has relied heavily on borrowing to cover its expenses.

22:50.760 --> 22:53.440
It's unclear to us how all two public schools

22:53.440 --> 22:55.800
have supported Prepatech in regard

22:55.800 --> 22:58.360
to their fiscal expertise and financial planning.

22:59.200 --> 23:02.320
It definitely is part of the consult,

23:02.320 --> 23:05.760
the fee that is paid every year to ALTA

23:05.760 --> 23:09.240
and from what I understand and from what they have said,

23:09.240 --> 23:11.520
that covers fiscal management.

23:12.960 --> 23:16.720
PTLH nor ALTA public schools has provided the CDE

23:16.720 --> 23:19.800
or the state board with a plan to manage or cut expenses

23:19.800 --> 23:22.080
to meet their fiscal uncertainty.

23:22.080 --> 23:25.800
And I will say that in the ACCS meeting,

23:25.840 --> 23:28.960
the commissioners had questions about this

23:28.960 --> 23:33.880
and a lot of concerns from some of our charter operators

23:33.880 --> 23:36.920
on the commission and charter staff

23:36.920 --> 23:40.640
as to why there's not ever been a fiscal plan

23:40.640 --> 23:45.640
to actually cut expenses to help their fiscal health.

23:48.280 --> 23:50.840
PTLH employs a large number of staff

23:50.840 --> 23:53.880
for a very small student population,

23:53.920 --> 23:56.680
23 teachers, three administrators,

23:56.680 --> 23:59.280
two resource specialists and a council,

23:59.280 --> 24:02.360
one counselor for about 350 students.

24:04.360 --> 24:08.480
And so that most of their budget really is towards staffing.

24:15.960 --> 24:18.800
The petitioner does not meet the renewal criteria

24:18.800 --> 24:21.160
inconsistent with sound educational practice.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.240
The petitioner does not meet the renewal criteria,

24:23.240 --> 24:25.400
does not present a sound educational program.

24:25.400 --> 24:28.920
While the majority of the educational program is sound,

24:28.920 --> 24:31.800
there's some real key pieces that are missing.

24:31.800 --> 24:34.800
The CDE finds that the lack of an English learner curriculum

24:34.800 --> 24:36.880
is problematic and does not align

24:36.880 --> 24:38.960
with a complete educational program.

24:38.960 --> 24:42.560
So they do have a detailed intervention program,

24:42.560 --> 24:45.920
but they do not have a curriculum,

24:45.920 --> 24:47.400
an English learner curriculum.

24:47.400 --> 24:50.040
Additionally, as a PTLH petition

24:50.040 --> 24:52.800
does not include reasonable descriptions of all.

24:53.360 --> 24:54.920
All the charter elements, the CDE finds

24:54.920 --> 24:58.240
that the petition is not entirely consistent

24:58.240 --> 25:00.680
with sound educational practice.

25:04.280 --> 25:06.280
Our findings regarding charter elements.

25:07.560 --> 25:10.360
The CDE finds that the petition

25:10.360 --> 25:12.760
does not necessarily provide, as just mentioned,

25:12.760 --> 25:16.040
a reasonably comprehensive description of element A.

25:16.040 --> 25:17.960
There was element D in there,

25:17.960 --> 25:22.640
and I will go into why I have that crossed out.

25:22.640 --> 25:24.800
Additionally, the CDE notes that the following elements

25:24.800 --> 25:27.600
could be strengthened, element J, suspension expulsion,

25:27.600 --> 25:29.240
element N, dispute resolution,

25:29.240 --> 25:31.840
and effect on authorizer and financial projections.

25:36.040 --> 25:38.120
So as stated just a moment ago,

25:40.000 --> 25:43.560
element A, which is description of educational program,

25:43.560 --> 25:45.720
the CDE finds that prep petition

25:45.720 --> 25:48.720
is not consistent with sound educational practice

25:48.720 --> 25:51.680
as it does not present a reasonably comprehensive

25:51.680 --> 25:53.640
description of the ELD program,

25:53.640 --> 25:56.920
specifically regarding not having a required

25:56.920 --> 26:00.000
California state standards aligned ELD curriculum.

26:04.480 --> 26:07.360
The governance structure,

26:07.360 --> 26:09.600
going into the ACCS meeting,

26:09.600 --> 26:12.600
we had still not received

26:12.600 --> 26:16.280
the required conflict of interest code

26:16.280 --> 26:17.640
that needed to be submitted.

26:17.640 --> 26:21.800
They did submit it a day before the ACCS meeting,

26:21.800 --> 26:24.040
so they are now in compliance.

26:26.320 --> 26:28.880
So the element D,

26:30.360 --> 26:32.400
governance structure piece is something

26:32.400 --> 26:36.120
that we can now say they're in compliance with.

26:39.800 --> 26:42.400
The CDE finds that the prep attack petition

26:42.400 --> 26:44.280
provides a reasonably comprehensive description

26:44.280 --> 26:46.240
of element J and element N.

26:46.240 --> 26:49.760
However, CDE notes these elements could be strengthened.

26:55.160 --> 26:58.640
Pursuant to Ed Code section 47605C5J,

26:58.640 --> 27:01.480
the prep attack petition is required to clearly state

27:01.480 --> 27:04.600
that when an appeal relating to the placement of a pupil

27:04.600 --> 27:07.040
or the manifestation determination has been requested

27:07.040 --> 27:08.640
by either the parent or prep attack,

27:08.640 --> 27:09.680
the pupil shall remain in an

27:09.680 --> 27:12.320
interim alternative education setting,

27:12.320 --> 27:15.040
pending the decision of the hearing officer.

27:15.120 --> 27:16.280
Whichever occurs first,

27:16.280 --> 27:18.720
unless the parent and PTLAH agree.

27:18.720 --> 27:21.040
Otherwise, this is language that we find missing

27:21.040 --> 27:23.480
in a lot of petitions that come forward to us,

27:23.480 --> 27:24.760
so this would need to be changed

27:24.760 --> 27:27.680
if this petition is approved.

27:30.600 --> 27:34.880
Element N, we note that

27:37.480 --> 27:38.960
per the request of the district,

27:38.960 --> 27:40.960
the petitioner changed the language of this element

27:40.960 --> 27:43.440
after submitting the petition to LAUSD.

27:43.440 --> 27:46.360
In order to reflect LAUSD as an authorizer,

27:48.400 --> 27:51.360
and there was just some discretion,

27:51.360 --> 27:55.720
and honestly, with 1505 and the new language

27:55.720 --> 27:58.200
about who's authorizer,

27:58.200 --> 28:01.360
who the authorizer will be assigned to,

28:01.360 --> 28:04.880
there definitely was some back and forth

28:04.880 --> 28:08.520
about who actually needed to be listed here.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.880
So it just needs to be corrected

28:09.880 --> 28:12.480
if the charter petition is approved.

28:14.160 --> 28:18.680
Effect on authorizer and financial projections,

28:18.680 --> 28:20.520
the prep attack petition does provide

28:20.520 --> 28:22.880
the required information and financial projections.

28:22.880 --> 28:24.760
However, the CDE notes of the language

28:24.760 --> 28:27.440
can be strengthened to specifically state the manner

28:27.440 --> 28:29.560
in which administrative services of the school

28:29.560 --> 28:31.960
are to be provided.

28:31.960 --> 28:36.960
So for instance, they have two administrative providers

28:39.680 --> 28:40.760
for the school.

28:40.800 --> 28:45.800
Alta, which is their CMO, is one of the providers,

28:46.200 --> 28:48.720
and we noted how much they receive,

28:48.720 --> 28:51.520
I think it's 12% of their total funding.

28:52.480 --> 28:55.240
But they also have another back office provider

28:55.240 --> 28:56.880
called Charter Impact that receives

28:56.880 --> 28:59.400
about $100,000 from the school.

28:59.400 --> 29:02.680
And it was not clear in the petition

29:02.680 --> 29:04.880
or any of the documents how,

29:07.400 --> 29:10.000
what services, which specific services

29:10.040 --> 29:13.160
that each of those entities provide the school.

29:18.360 --> 29:20.480
So in conclusion, the CDE recommends

29:20.480 --> 29:22.080
the State Board deny the request

29:22.080 --> 29:25.120
to renew the PTLA-H petition.

29:25.120 --> 29:28.920
As I said earlier, at the April 2021 ACCS meeting,

29:28.920 --> 29:31.000
commissioners voted unanimously

29:31.000 --> 29:34.680
to recommend denial of the prep attack renewal.

29:34.680 --> 29:36.880
If the SBE grants renewal of the petition

29:36.880 --> 29:40.840
pursuant to Ed Code section 47607,

29:40.840 --> 29:43.640
the CDE is recommending that the State Board

29:43.640 --> 29:46.400
designate the Los Angeles Unified School District

29:46.400 --> 29:49.560
as the chartering authority for prep tech high school.

29:50.840 --> 29:53.040
And that concludes my presentation.

29:54.760 --> 29:57.000
So Stephanie, thank you so much

29:57.000 --> 30:00.960
for a really specific and thorough presentation.

30:00.960 --> 30:04.280
We are now going to open up the public hearing

30:04.280 --> 30:07.720
at 10.02 a.m.

30:07.720 --> 30:09.280
First, we're going to hear from the petitioners

30:09.280 --> 30:10.720
representing the charter school

30:10.720 --> 30:14.200
and each side will have 12 minutes.

30:14.200 --> 30:17.760
So we'll ask our charter school representatives

30:17.760 --> 30:22.520
to join us now, and then you may begin.

30:22.520 --> 30:23.360
Hello.

30:23.360 --> 30:24.200
Can you hear me?

30:24.200 --> 30:25.040
Yes.

30:25.040 --> 30:25.880
Yes, we can.

30:25.880 --> 30:27.440
Good morning, dear board members.

30:27.440 --> 30:29.200
Thank you very much for the opportunity

30:29.200 --> 30:31.440
to tell our side of the story.

30:31.440 --> 30:32.800
My name is Mario Reyes.

30:32.800 --> 30:37.360
I'm the founder and CEO of Alta Public Schools.

30:37.360 --> 30:40.440
In 2015, we sought to start prep attack high school

30:40.440 --> 30:43.760
at the behest of our parents that loved the school

30:43.760 --> 30:46.520
and that loved the school and that loved the school

30:46.520 --> 30:48.400
and that loved the school and that loved the school

30:48.400 --> 30:50.440
and that loved the school and that loved the school

30:50.600 --> 30:53.400
at the behest of our parents that love

30:53.400 --> 30:56.360
the holistic approach of an IB education.

30:56.360 --> 30:59.240
At that time, we made a promise to our parents

30:59.240 --> 31:02.520
that their children would get a world-class education

31:02.520 --> 31:05.280
and get them a college if we were approved.

31:05.280 --> 31:10.280
In early 2016, we came to this board on appeal from LAUSD.

31:10.600 --> 31:13.840
During that meeting, one SB board members shared,

31:13.840 --> 31:16.280
not sure why you're here and voted for us

31:16.280 --> 31:18.480
to start the school on the very same promise

31:18.480 --> 31:20.200
we made to our parents.

31:20.960 --> 31:23.520
Provide a world-class education to all students

31:23.520 --> 31:26.240
and get them to college well-prepared.

31:26.240 --> 31:28.520
Today, we want to affirm to those board members

31:28.520 --> 31:31.960
and the families we serve, we kept our promise.

31:31.960 --> 31:35.040
We are providing a world-class education to every student.

31:39.560 --> 31:42.560
Our students are showing steady growth in ELA and math

31:42.560 --> 31:44.200
over the current charter term,

31:44.200 --> 31:46.920
as demonstrated by NWA scores.

31:46.920 --> 31:48.960
Last year, with our first seniors,

31:48.960 --> 31:52.040
we had a graduating class of nearly 90%

31:52.040 --> 31:55.520
and 70% of those graduates are going to college.

31:55.520 --> 31:59.320
This is an average greater than LAUSD and the state.

31:59.320 --> 32:03.520
This year, we're projected to graduate 97% of our students

32:03.520 --> 32:06.560
despite the pandemic and more and more of our students

32:06.560 --> 32:09.480
are going to prestigious colleges and universities.

32:10.440 --> 32:14.200
On our finances this year, we're also projected

32:14.200 --> 32:17.480
to end the year with positive net assets of 300,000

32:17.480 --> 32:20.600
and reserves of 5.5%.

32:20.600 --> 32:22.200
But over the last five years,

32:22.200 --> 32:24.720
it has not been a straight shot.

32:24.720 --> 32:27.520
It's been more like the path of a butterfly.

32:27.520 --> 32:31.600
After we opened our doors in the fall of 2016,

32:31.600 --> 32:33.440
we opened with 100 plus students

32:33.440 --> 32:36.080
and with no charter school startup grant funding

32:36.080 --> 32:41.080
or any other kind of financing.

32:41.280 --> 32:43.480
The second year, we doubled our enrollment

32:43.480 --> 32:46.920
and moved to an LAUSD Prop 39 site.

32:46.960 --> 32:48.880
Soon we realized that if we grow again

32:48.880 --> 32:51.840
by another 100 plus students the following year,

32:51.840 --> 32:55.680
the Prop 39 site would be inadequate for student stability

32:55.680 --> 32:59.680
and undermine the IB program facility requirements.

32:59.680 --> 33:04.440
Therefore, in order to provide education and stability

33:04.440 --> 33:06.800
and equity to our students,

33:06.800 --> 33:09.680
we were presented with a once in a lifetime opportunity

33:09.680 --> 33:14.080
in the LA market, a permanent facility nearby.

33:14.080 --> 33:18.440
We believe that if we invested early in a stable facility,

33:18.440 --> 33:21.560
the benefits would be enormous for the community at large

33:21.560 --> 33:23.400
in the long term.

33:23.400 --> 33:25.800
So we borrowed to refurbish the facility

33:25.800 --> 33:27.800
that the school occupies today.

33:27.800 --> 33:29.600
This is our home behind me.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.920
Our parents are very proud of their school

33:31.920 --> 33:35.000
and how great it reflects on the positive impact

33:35.000 --> 33:37.760
students are making in their community.

33:37.760 --> 33:40.760
However, to prepare this stable home,

33:40.760 --> 33:42.640
we had to secure financing,

33:42.640 --> 33:45.640
borrow internally from our sister schools

33:45.640 --> 33:48.680
and slowly build the reserves requirement.

33:48.680 --> 33:50.040
At the end of that second year,

33:50.040 --> 33:52.280
we reflected short and long,

33:52.280 --> 33:54.840
both academically and financially.

33:56.000 --> 33:59.840
We concluded that although the academic program was strong

33:59.840 --> 34:01.400
and students were achieving,

34:01.400 --> 34:03.840
we needed to engage financial experts

34:03.840 --> 34:08.120
to achieve a balanced budget and gain reserves

34:08.120 --> 34:10.520
and to ensure we would fulfill the promise

34:10.520 --> 34:13.560
we made to the community and to this board.

34:13.560 --> 34:16.120
This is why in the third fiscal year,

34:16.120 --> 34:19.520
we contracted with charter school finance experts,

34:19.520 --> 34:21.280
Spencer Stiles and Charter Impact

34:21.280 --> 34:23.760
to help us create a multi-year plan

34:23.760 --> 34:26.800
to get us back to good financial health

34:26.800 --> 34:30.040
representative of a world-class school.

34:30.040 --> 34:32.920
Here's Spencer Stiles to explain what he and his team

34:32.920 --> 34:35.760
did for us with our fiscal austerity plan

34:35.760 --> 34:37.160
to get us back on track.

34:38.080 --> 34:38.920
Spencer.

34:38.960 --> 34:41.200
Javier and good morning board members.

34:41.200 --> 34:43.840
Thank you for your time and attention today.

34:43.840 --> 34:46.160
Prior getting into some of the historical

34:46.160 --> 34:48.160
financial activity of the school,

34:48.160 --> 34:50.080
I do wanna clarify and point out

34:50.080 --> 34:52.600
what I think is a pretty critical concept

34:52.600 --> 34:54.880
and that is the fact that the school has

34:54.880 --> 34:57.440
looking historically actually maintained

34:57.440 --> 35:00.200
or hit that 5% ending fund balance,

35:00.200 --> 35:03.360
which is clearly a significant concern.

35:03.360 --> 35:05.520
I do think it is important to point out

35:05.520 --> 35:08.160
just in terms of accuracy

35:08.280 --> 35:11.000
that fund balance is a cumulative number.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.880
And so as you can see on the screen in front of you,

35:13.880 --> 35:16.520
the first two years of deficit

35:16.520 --> 35:18.560
were large enough to create a goal,

35:18.560 --> 35:21.640
which were then required three years

35:21.640 --> 35:26.000
of balanced budgets and surpluses to overshadow them.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.760
So while the school has not hit that 5% deserve

35:28.760 --> 35:30.360
until the current year,

35:30.360 --> 35:32.240
again, it is important to understand

35:32.240 --> 35:34.200
that it is a cumulative figure

35:34.200 --> 35:36.640
and the school has actually turned the tables

35:36.640 --> 35:39.840
so to speak financially in year three,

35:39.840 --> 35:43.320
as you can see with the annual surplus of 390,000.

35:43.320 --> 35:45.680
Now to give a little historical context,

35:45.680 --> 35:49.680
Carter Impact was in during the middle of year three

35:49.680 --> 35:52.000
after the school had understandable concerns

35:52.000 --> 35:55.520
over its fiscal operations, accuracy of forecasting

35:55.520 --> 35:57.480
and readiness of financial reporting.

35:58.560 --> 36:00.320
As a part of our initial engagement,

36:00.320 --> 36:02.120
we'd review the internal control,

36:02.120 --> 36:04.040
fiscal policies and procedures,

36:04.040 --> 36:06.360
accuracy of forecasting and budgeting

36:07.120 --> 36:08.560
and we're asked to come on board full-time

36:08.560 --> 36:12.240
from the first of 2019 towards the end of year three.

36:12.240 --> 36:14.160
As a part of our engagement,

36:14.160 --> 36:17.000
we immediately changed the reporting process,

36:17.000 --> 36:19.720
increased the accuracy of projections and budgets

36:19.720 --> 36:21.960
and also sped up reporting to the board,

36:21.960 --> 36:26.440
giving the schools the information and data necessary

36:26.440 --> 36:29.360
to make the proper decisions for cost of solvency.

36:29.360 --> 36:31.560
That does include providing financial reports

36:31.560 --> 36:36.200
correctly to the board within 10 days after the end of the year.

36:36.200 --> 36:39.280
Looking at the operations going through year three,

36:39.280 --> 36:41.480
Javier did mention that there was a significant amount

36:41.480 --> 36:45.560
of facility costs which led to that $150,000 deficit

36:45.560 --> 36:48.600
with cumulative $880,000 negative fund balance.

36:49.600 --> 36:53.240
In year three, those facility costs did not continue.

36:53.240 --> 36:57.840
The Prop 39 site was eliminated as it was no longer necessary.

36:57.840 --> 37:00.920
Staff levels were frozen in that fiscal year

37:00.920 --> 37:03.760
with the exception of necessary instructions

37:03.760 --> 37:05.520
stamped for classrooms.

37:05.520 --> 37:08.760
The student ADA and enrollment increased by 15

37:08.760 --> 37:12.160
and the result was a $390,000 surplus,

37:12.160 --> 37:15.680
making a huge reduction of the negative fund balance.

37:15.680 --> 37:18.520
In year four, a second site was added

37:18.520 --> 37:20.920
to account for the additional six months

37:20.920 --> 37:24.320
while the school reached full grade 9-12.

37:24.320 --> 37:26.800
The school maintained the first degrees

37:26.800 --> 37:30.400
on non-required instructional staff.

37:30.400 --> 37:31.600
And again, as you can see,

37:31.600 --> 37:33.720
the school maintained the balance budget

37:33.760 --> 37:36.920
and had another surplus in year four of about $67,000.

37:37.960 --> 37:40.120
In the current year, we are projecting

37:40.120 --> 37:42.600
less than 45 days from now,

37:42.600 --> 37:45.480
leaving with a surplus of $720,000.

37:45.480 --> 37:50.480
As referenced, $400,000 did come from a forgiven PPP loan,

37:50.640 --> 37:52.760
but even without that, the school was on target

37:52.760 --> 37:57.080
to have an additional $300,000 surplus this year.

37:57.080 --> 38:00.120
Please also note that that amount does include

38:00.120 --> 38:02.760
all of the costs of all the current

38:02.760 --> 38:05.560
and outstanding borrowing necessary

38:05.560 --> 38:07.920
to overcompensate the referral.

38:07.920 --> 38:10.040
Looking forward, while the school is projecting

38:10.040 --> 38:12.960
the enrollment next year of 376,

38:12.960 --> 38:15.720
it's also important to note that at this practice,

38:15.720 --> 38:18.200
we also maintain multiple budget scenarios

38:18.200 --> 38:20.960
based on the current enrollment as of today

38:20.960 --> 38:23.960
to ensure that the school is not incurring any costs,

38:23.960 --> 38:26.920
finalizing hiring or incurring anything else

38:26.920 --> 38:28.960
that would potentially tip the school

38:28.960 --> 38:31.520
back into the deficit until we have confirmation

38:31.520 --> 38:33.720
that the enrollment number is reached.

38:33.720 --> 38:36.640
And so with that, I will pass it over to Javier

38:36.640 --> 38:39.040
to address the rest of the austerity measures

38:39.040 --> 38:41.160
being focused on for the upcoming years.

38:52.760 --> 38:54.920
Mr. Reyes, you may want to unmute yourself.

38:55.920 --> 38:57.360
Thank you so much.

38:57.360 --> 39:00.360
To be clear, we want to communicate to you

39:00.360 --> 39:05.360
that we understand how severe the situation looked,

39:05.840 --> 39:08.760
and we understand that operating in a deficit

39:08.760 --> 39:13.760
is a main reason LAUSD denied our renewal last year,

39:13.800 --> 39:16.920
despite their efforts from staff

39:16.920 --> 39:19.560
to keep us open during the pandemic.

39:19.560 --> 39:22.360
We sincerely thank LAUSD staff

39:22.840 --> 39:26.960
for the positive recommendation to the current SBE board.

39:26.960 --> 39:30.760
We can assure you that if given the opportunity,

39:30.760 --> 39:33.280
we will continue to do everything we can

39:33.280 --> 39:36.960
to make sure our finances continue to improve every year.

39:36.960 --> 39:39.560
Moving forward, we will continue to work

39:39.560 --> 39:41.960
with Spencer Stiles and his team

39:41.960 --> 39:44.840
to continue to keep us on track.

39:44.840 --> 39:47.160
We'll continue to work with Larson Communications

39:47.160 --> 39:48.480
digital marketing experts

39:48.480 --> 39:52.000
who continue to assist us with student recruitment.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.400
We'll transition to utilizing a line of credit

39:54.400 --> 39:57.320
from our bank instead of expensive short-term financing.

39:58.520 --> 40:01.760
We will improve our fundraising capabilities and results

40:01.760 --> 40:04.720
working with National Charter School Resource Center,

40:04.720 --> 40:09.000
and we'll reactivate our LEA Medicare reimbursement program

40:09.000 --> 40:11.440
to recapture special ed funding

40:11.440 --> 40:14.280
of up to 50% of expenditures.

40:14.280 --> 40:15.760
We'll identify liquid assets

40:15.760 --> 40:19.240
in case of severe cash shortages in academics.

40:19.280 --> 40:22.280
Here's Rachel Villalobos, Interim Superintendent,

40:22.280 --> 40:23.480
to talk about academics.

40:24.560 --> 40:25.440
Thank you, Mr. Reyes.

40:25.440 --> 40:26.480
Good morning, Board President

40:26.480 --> 40:28.640
and members of the State Board of Education.

40:28.640 --> 40:31.120
In these short five years of existence,

40:31.120 --> 40:33.360
we have had the opportunity through hard work

40:33.360 --> 40:35.320
from students, parents, and staff

40:35.320 --> 40:37.160
to become an IB World School.

40:37.160 --> 40:40.440
We are one out of four IB DP schools

40:40.440 --> 40:43.480
in the Los Angeles Unified School District region.

40:43.480 --> 40:46.760
We are the only TK through 12th grade

40:46.760 --> 40:49.320
to be an IB continuum organization

40:49.320 --> 40:54.160
with the PYP, NYP, and DP IB program.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.200
The slide that you see here is PrepaTech High

40:56.200 --> 40:59.280
has both middle years and diploma program authorized,

40:59.280 --> 41:01.600
which is part of the IB continuum.

41:01.600 --> 41:04.320
100% of our students are IB students.

41:04.320 --> 41:08.280
We have 100% of our students that are IB eligible.

41:08.280 --> 41:11.800
Those who do not have an interest in the IB DP candidacy

41:11.800 --> 41:13.680
by the time they get to your own grade

41:13.720 --> 41:16.640
benefit from IB via theory of knowledge,

41:16.640 --> 41:19.720
approaches to learning, learner profile attributes,

41:19.720 --> 41:22.000
and community activity service.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.880
It is my pleasure to introduce to you, Mr. Alqueda,

41:24.880 --> 41:26.960
our high school's head of school principal.

41:27.840 --> 41:29.800
Good morning, members of the board.

41:29.800 --> 41:34.520
In 2020, 89% of our first group of seniors graduated.

41:34.520 --> 41:37.560
Currently, we have 97% of our seniors projected

41:37.560 --> 41:39.840
to graduate at the end of this year.

41:39.840 --> 41:42.920
75% of the students who applied to colleges

41:43.000 --> 41:45.520
have actually received acceptance letters.

41:45.520 --> 41:48.160
In fact, 24% of those students have received

41:48.160 --> 41:51.160
acceptance letters from two or more college and university.

41:56.040 --> 42:01.000
And we agree with the staff report on pages three to 14

42:01.000 --> 42:04.080
in which PrepaTech provided a reasonable comprehensive

42:04.080 --> 42:06.480
description of the plan for low achieving

42:06.480 --> 42:08.000
and high achieving pupils,

42:08.000 --> 42:12.240
as well as meeting the AB 1505 middle performance criteria.

42:12.240 --> 42:15.360
Our ELD program is comprehensive

42:16.680 --> 42:20.400
and comprised of both integrated and designated ELD.

42:20.400 --> 42:23.920
The IB program is committed to supporting multilingualism

42:23.920 --> 42:26.720
as a fundamental part of increasing intercultural

42:26.720 --> 42:29.520
understanding and international mindfulness,

42:29.520 --> 42:33.160
and is equally committed to extending access

42:33.160 --> 42:36.040
to an IB education for students from a variety

42:36.040 --> 42:38.680
of cultural and linguistic background.

42:38.680 --> 42:39.760
Thank you, PrepaTech.

42:39.760 --> 42:42.240
Your time for public presentation is now over.

42:45.960 --> 42:46.880
Thank you very much, Rita.

42:46.880 --> 42:47.920
Thank you very much.

42:49.160 --> 42:52.360
So now we will hear from the school district,

42:52.360 --> 42:55.160
and the district will have 12 minutes as well.

42:55.160 --> 42:57.160
Good morning, Vice President Strauss,

42:57.160 --> 43:00.160
Deputy Superintendent Gregson, members of the SBE.

43:00.160 --> 43:02.920
My name is Bob Perry, and today I'm representing

43:02.920 --> 43:05.440
Los Angeles Unified School District,

43:05.440 --> 43:07.080
where I serve as one of the leaders

43:07.080 --> 43:09.160
of the charter schools division.

43:09.160 --> 43:13.200
I'm joined today by three of the school district leaders,

43:13.200 --> 43:15.240
and I'm going to introduce them.

43:15.240 --> 43:17.800
First, I'm going to introduce you to Bob Perry,

43:17.800 --> 43:20.080
who is the vice president of the SBE.

43:20.080 --> 43:22.800
Bob Perry is the vice president of the SBE,

43:23.480 --> 43:27.520
I'm joined today by three other members of our team,

43:27.520 --> 43:31.440
our director, Joseco Gutierrez, Lillian Lee,

43:31.440 --> 43:34.360
who leads our fiscal team that reviewed the petition

43:34.360 --> 43:37.240
for PrepaTech, and Christian Mendez,

43:37.240 --> 43:39.520
who leads the instructional operational team

43:39.520 --> 43:41.760
that reviewed the petition as well.

43:42.760 --> 43:45.400
We come today to support the recommendation

43:45.400 --> 43:48.360
of the California Department of Education staff,

43:48.360 --> 43:52.200
and the prior decision of the LAUSD Board of Education

43:52.240 --> 43:55.480
for the denial of the renewal of this charter.

43:55.480 --> 43:58.800
This school is currently operating within LAUSD's boundaries

43:58.800 --> 44:02.200
and the district oversees its two sister schools,

44:02.200 --> 44:05.300
Academia Moderna and PrepaTech Middle School.

44:06.400 --> 44:08.360
Should the State Board of Education

44:08.360 --> 44:11.720
deny the renewal of this charter school today,

44:11.720 --> 44:15.400
please know that LAUSD is committed

44:15.400 --> 44:18.400
to actively working with CDE staff

44:18.400 --> 44:22.280
as the current authorizing staff and the charter school

44:22.280 --> 44:25.200
to support all current students and families

44:25.200 --> 44:29.000
to enroll at another LAUSD public school.

44:29.960 --> 44:33.000
As we do with the closure of any charter school

44:33.000 --> 44:36.880
within LAUSD boundaries, our team has an extensive plan

44:36.880 --> 44:40.240
for ensuring the continuity of education for all students,

44:40.240 --> 44:42.480
including, but not limited to,

44:42.480 --> 44:44.920
working with the current authorizer and staff

44:44.920 --> 44:48.200
to connect parents with local district staff

44:49.000 --> 44:51.920
to explore all placement options that would be available,

44:51.920 --> 44:54.800
such as international baccalaureate programs,

44:54.800 --> 44:57.400
magnet programs, district pilot schools,

44:57.400 --> 44:59.440
programs for students with disabilities

44:59.440 --> 45:01.240
and charter programs.

45:01.240 --> 45:04.080
Also making sure that current transcripts

45:04.080 --> 45:06.960
and other relevant documents are thoroughly reviewed

45:06.960 --> 45:10.200
to inform the best placement.

45:10.200 --> 45:13.320
Regarding the detail of the item before you today,

45:13.320 --> 45:15.760
much of our in-depth analysis was similar,

45:15.800 --> 45:18.560
if not identical to that of the CDE staff

45:18.560 --> 45:20.960
who has been their authorizer for the past five years.

45:20.960 --> 45:24.400
So we will not go through that analysis again today,

45:24.400 --> 45:27.320
but we'd like to provide you some context

45:27.320 --> 45:31.520
for our recommendation and the board's ultimate decision.

45:32.640 --> 45:37.320
Our review of this application came during the fall of 2020

45:37.320 --> 45:39.240
when California was in the throes

45:39.240 --> 45:41.440
of the worst part of the pandemic

45:41.440 --> 45:44.400
without a clear path forward for reopening schools

45:44.400 --> 45:46.720
for in-person instruction.

45:46.720 --> 45:49.880
The situation was unprecedented,

45:49.880 --> 45:54.600
as was our recommendation for a conditional approval.

45:54.600 --> 45:58.320
Ultimately, after extensive deliberation,

45:58.320 --> 46:03.120
the LAUSD board determined that a denial was warranted

46:03.120 --> 46:06.160
and would be in the best interest of students

46:06.160 --> 46:09.000
despite the pandemic circumstances.

46:10.040 --> 46:12.440
One of the ways we address closure

46:12.440 --> 46:14.520
being in the best interest of pupils

46:14.520 --> 46:17.280
is by comparing data to the schools

46:17.280 --> 46:19.840
the students would have otherwise attended

46:19.840 --> 46:23.440
based on their addresses as provided by the school

46:23.440 --> 46:28.000
and compiled by the LAUSD Office of Data and Accountability.

46:28.000 --> 46:31.080
The data we used was the 2019 data

46:31.080 --> 46:33.800
mentioned by the CDE previously.

46:33.800 --> 46:36.560
I'd like to call on my colleague, Christian Mendez,

46:36.560 --> 46:41.000
to briefly run through the overall comparison by metric.

46:43.440 --> 46:44.800
And hello, good morning.

46:44.800 --> 46:46.160
Good morning, board members.

46:46.160 --> 46:48.480
A pleasure to be with you this morning.

46:48.480 --> 46:52.920
As Dr. Perry has asked, I would like to share with you

46:54.000 --> 46:59.080
a comparison of PrepTech Los Angeles High School's

46:59.080 --> 47:02.200
performance compared to the median performance

47:02.200 --> 47:06.920
of the 20 resident schools that students would otherwise

47:06.920 --> 47:08.920
have attended based on their address.

47:08.920 --> 47:11.440
So where data is available, I'll share out.

47:11.480 --> 47:14.840
So in ELA, the resident schools median

47:14.840 --> 47:17.400
is outperforming PrepTech.

47:17.400 --> 47:21.560
Resident schools median is at negative four in ELA,

47:21.560 --> 47:23.400
whereas prep distance from standard,

47:23.400 --> 47:26.960
whereas PrepTech is at negative 65.7.

47:26.960 --> 47:29.520
That translates into 17 out of the 20

47:29.520 --> 47:32.120
resident schools outperforming.

47:34.160 --> 47:35.600
Excuse me, in math.

47:37.560 --> 47:39.080
Bad timing for a frog in your throat.

47:39.400 --> 47:40.240
Okay, in math.

47:41.560 --> 47:43.120
In math, again, the same story.

47:43.120 --> 47:46.560
We see the resident schools median of 92.3

47:46.560 --> 47:48.840
outperforming the charter schools

47:50.040 --> 47:53.920
distance from standard of negative 169.8,

47:53.920 --> 47:57.000
translating into 19 of the 20 resident schools

47:57.000 --> 47:58.760
outperforming the school in math.

48:00.920 --> 48:03.280
In LP, we see the converse,

48:03.280 --> 48:06.960
where we see the charter schools, 42.9%,

48:06.960 --> 48:08.720
outperforming the residents.

48:08.760 --> 48:11.840
So here, we actually see the charter school

48:11.840 --> 48:14.720
outperforming the majority of the resident schools.

48:14.720 --> 48:16.920
Only five of total in the school here.

48:18.960 --> 48:22.840
In suspension, we see that the majority of the schools,

48:22.840 --> 48:27.840
19 of 20, outperforming the charter school.

48:27.840 --> 48:32.840
The median suspension rate is 0.3 for the resident schools,

48:32.840 --> 48:37.400
whereas PrepTech high schools is 1.5.

48:37.640 --> 48:41.360
In reclassification, again, we see the same pattern,

48:41.360 --> 48:43.200
that the resident schools,

48:44.360 --> 48:47.920
the median is outperforming PrepTech high school.

48:47.920 --> 48:51.280
So here, we see 19 of 20 resident schools

48:51.280 --> 48:54.600
with a better reclassification rate than PrepTechs.

48:54.600 --> 48:58.960
The median for the resident schools was 15.5,

48:58.960 --> 49:03.960
compared to PREPA's 3.8, and this is 19, 20.

49:04.800 --> 49:09.800
And then lastly, in both CASPLA and math,

49:10.600 --> 49:13.160
we see the resident schools percentage

49:13.160 --> 49:16.320
of students meeting and exceeding standards,

49:16.320 --> 49:19.600
outperforming PREPA Tech highs.

49:19.600 --> 49:23.360
In ELA specifically, the median for the resident school

49:23.360 --> 49:27.840
met and exceeded percentage is 51.56%,

49:27.840 --> 49:32.160
compared to PREPA's 24.47.

49:32.200 --> 49:36.800
And in math, same story, in ELA,

49:36.800 --> 49:39.520
that translates to 18 of 20 resident schools

49:39.520 --> 49:42.160
outperforming the charter school.

49:42.160 --> 49:45.280
In math, 19 of 20 resident schools

49:45.280 --> 49:48.040
are outperforming the charter school.

49:48.040 --> 49:52.320
The median performance for met and exceeded percentage

49:52.320 --> 49:55.560
in math for resident schools is 19.62,

49:55.560 --> 50:00.560
compared to 3.26 of PREPA Techs

50:00.800 --> 50:02.480
meeting and exceeding standards in math.

50:02.480 --> 50:05.440
So in summary, what we see is that

50:05.440 --> 50:07.800
in the majority of the categories,

50:07.800 --> 50:12.800
ELA, math, suspension, reclassification,

50:12.840 --> 50:16.920
CASP, ELA, and math of meeting and exceeding standards,

50:18.000 --> 50:20.480
we see that the resident schools,

50:20.480 --> 50:23.520
majority of them are outperforming the charter school

50:23.520 --> 50:24.720
with the available data.

50:25.800 --> 50:27.800
I wanted to share that for your consideration.

50:27.800 --> 50:28.840
Thank you, Dr. Perry.

50:29.800 --> 50:33.720
Board members, I have not been before you for a while,

50:33.720 --> 50:37.040
but have stood before you numerous occasions.

50:37.040 --> 50:41.800
And I absolutely detest to ask you

50:41.800 --> 50:45.160
to support a recommendation to close a charter school.

50:45.160 --> 50:46.960
It's never easy.

50:46.960 --> 50:48.880
But I'm here to assure you today,

50:48.880 --> 50:51.400
as we've assured you in the past,

50:51.400 --> 50:55.560
that we stand ready and experienced

50:55.560 --> 50:57.880
to support students and families

50:57.880 --> 51:01.160
if that is the decision of the board today.

51:01.160 --> 51:04.360
We ask you to support the CDE recommendation

51:04.360 --> 51:06.400
as well as the previous vote

51:06.400 --> 51:08.920
of the LAUSD Board of Education.

51:08.920 --> 51:11.120
Thank you so much for your time.

51:11.120 --> 51:13.000
And we'll be here and available

51:13.000 --> 51:15.200
for any questions you might have for us.

51:15.200 --> 51:17.520
Thank you so much, Vice President Strauss.

51:19.120 --> 51:23.000
Thank you, Los Angeles Unified Charter School Division Team.

51:23.000 --> 51:27.880
So we will now open the phone line

51:27.880 --> 51:30.640
for our public comment queue.

51:30.640 --> 51:32.080
So members of the public wishing

51:32.080 --> 51:35.200
to provide comment on this item may do so.

51:35.200 --> 51:37.320
So let's put the slide up now

51:38.440 --> 51:41.440
that we will be using for public comment.

51:41.440 --> 51:44.400
When you call in, we're gonna ask you

51:44.400 --> 51:47.800
to state your name and affiliation for the record.

51:47.800 --> 51:50.560
And remember to turn down your speaker volume

51:50.560 --> 51:53.400
of your computer if you're following the live feed

51:53.400 --> 51:55.520
because otherwise we'll hear an echo.

51:55.520 --> 51:57.520
You are gonna have one minute.

51:57.520 --> 52:00.040
We do remind you to please be respectful.

52:00.040 --> 52:02.720
And at this time, all comments are related

52:02.720 --> 52:06.560
to the Prepatec Los Angeles High School Charter item.

52:06.560 --> 52:09.520
And now I'm going to ask the Spanish translator

52:09.520 --> 52:12.600
to read the, to translate the instructions

52:12.600 --> 52:14.360
in Spanish for our callers.

52:15.360 --> 52:16.640
Good morning.

52:16.640 --> 52:20.120
At this time, public comments will begin.

52:20.120 --> 52:25.120
The phone number is 712-770-4917.

52:26.840 --> 52:31.840
And the access code is 467-9071.

52:32.120 --> 52:34.280
Please, when it's your turn,

52:34.280 --> 52:36.080
an operator will ask you in English

52:36.080 --> 52:38.760
to state your name and affiliation

52:38.760 --> 52:41.000
and to start your intervention.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.280
Please say, my name is,

52:43.320 --> 52:46.960
represento a, y necesito un traductor.

52:46.960 --> 52:48.880
Su tiempo comenzará cuando empiece.

52:50.200 --> 52:51.520
Muchas gracias.

52:51.520 --> 52:55.320
So now we're going to open up for public comments.

52:55.320 --> 52:59.160
Do we have any public items on the Prepatec Los Angeles

52:59.160 --> 53:01.600
High School Charter renewal?

53:02.640 --> 53:04.200
Yes, we have public comments.

53:07.200 --> 53:08.760
Caller, please state.

53:08.760 --> 53:10.080
Go ahead.

53:10.080 --> 53:11.200
Caller, please state your name

53:11.200 --> 53:12.760
and affiliation for the record.

53:12.760 --> 53:13.720
You have one minute.

53:13.720 --> 53:14.880
Your time begins now.

53:18.200 --> 53:19.040
Good morning.

53:19.040 --> 53:19.880
This is Walter Guzman.

53:19.880 --> 53:21.400
I'm a resource specialist teacher

53:21.400 --> 53:24.440
at Alta Public Schools Prepatec Los Angeles High School.

53:24.440 --> 53:26.080
I would like to take this opportunity

53:26.080 --> 53:28.520
to request that Prepatec Los Angeles High School

53:28.520 --> 53:31.000
be renewed for another five years

53:31.000 --> 53:32.640
due to several reasons.

53:32.640 --> 53:34.960
Prepatec is a school that educates the whole child

53:34.960 --> 53:37.760
using the international bachelor curriculum.

53:37.760 --> 53:40.360
There are no other schools in the southeast Los Angeles area

53:40.360 --> 53:42.200
that offer this international program

53:42.640 --> 53:44.360
that educates students to be inquirers,

53:44.360 --> 53:46.120
which is a skill set that is needed

53:46.120 --> 53:48.800
in the future information economy.

53:48.800 --> 53:51.440
This mindset is needed for many of tomorrow's leaders,

53:51.440 --> 53:53.160
innovators and thinkers.

53:53.160 --> 53:55.360
The education that is given at Prepatec High School

53:55.360 --> 53:57.840
trains many students to be better thinkers

53:57.840 --> 54:00.880
that will be better overall for our future economy.

54:00.880 --> 54:03.240
Many of these students come to Prepatec High School

54:03.240 --> 54:06.200
to earn college credit, experience small class sizes,

54:06.200 --> 54:08.520
and to develop lifelong relationships

54:08.520 --> 54:10.560
with both peers and staff,

54:10.560 --> 54:12.480
an advantage that other high schools

54:12.480 --> 54:14.240
in the area don't offer.

54:14.240 --> 54:16.640
The progress is showing in the way more students

54:16.640 --> 54:19.000
in the area graduate from Prepatec High School

54:19.000 --> 54:21.880
and go on to good universities and colleges.

54:21.880 --> 54:22.720
Thank you.

54:22.720 --> 54:25.120
I request, please renew Prepatec Los Angeles High School

54:25.120 --> 54:26.520
for another five years.

54:33.360 --> 54:34.560
Caller, please state your name

54:34.560 --> 54:36.640
and affiliation for the record.

54:36.640 --> 54:38.760
You have one minute, your time begins now.

54:41.400 --> 54:43.240
My name is Mark Nolan.

54:43.240 --> 54:46.360
I'm a retired school administrator of 30 years

54:46.360 --> 54:50.040
and I am now working with the Alta School District.

54:50.040 --> 54:52.680
In my present position as an assistant principal,

54:52.680 --> 54:56.200
I've had the opportunity to observe a team of educators

54:57.400 --> 54:59.280
throughout the district that are dedicated

54:59.280 --> 55:02.840
to the academic growth and social awareness of our students.

55:02.840 --> 55:06.720
Our fledgling IB program provides this

55:06.720 --> 55:08.840
to a group of students that normally

55:08.920 --> 55:11.920
would not have a program of this stature.

55:11.920 --> 55:15.960
And this was accomplished with a balanced budget

55:15.960 --> 55:18.120
and a required reserve.

55:18.120 --> 55:21.120
Alta's leadership understands the concept

55:21.120 --> 55:24.120
of investing in our students now

55:24.120 --> 55:27.840
and that we're actually investing in their future.

55:27.840 --> 55:30.000
Thank you for listening to our petition

55:30.000 --> 55:32.080
for renewal of Prepatec High School.

55:39.720 --> 55:41.240
Hello, caller, please state your name

55:41.240 --> 55:42.880
and affiliation for the record.

55:42.880 --> 55:45.320
You have one minute, your time begins now.

55:51.160 --> 55:52.680
Hello, Barry Baxter,

55:52.680 --> 55:55.560
Superintendent, Alta Public Schools, retired.

55:55.560 --> 55:58.320
The IB diploma program offered by Prepatec High School

55:58.320 --> 56:00.880
far outweighs the dismal district alternative

56:00.880 --> 56:04.200
in regards to success in reaching higher level education.

56:04.200 --> 56:05.880
Prepatec High School was designed

56:05.880 --> 56:07.800
to include the IB diploma program

56:07.840 --> 56:10.600
to allow students of this underserved community

56:10.600 --> 56:13.760
a proven gateway to success at the college level.

56:13.760 --> 56:17.000
Prepatec's current graduation rate of 97%

56:17.000 --> 56:20.360
far outperformed district schools of the same service area

56:20.360 --> 56:23.280
who averaged only 80.6% last year.

56:23.280 --> 56:25.000
Without access to proven approaches

56:25.000 --> 56:26.400
of the IB diploma program,

56:26.400 --> 56:28.600
the students of this community are fated

56:28.600 --> 56:30.720
to receive a typical district education

56:30.720 --> 56:33.120
that has evidently lack of adequate preparation

56:33.120 --> 56:35.480
for success in higher level education.

56:35.480 --> 56:37.600
This charter renewal must be approved

56:37.600 --> 56:40.920
to ensure the successful pathway to higher education

56:40.920 --> 56:42.760
for the students of this community.

56:42.760 --> 56:43.600
Thank you, board.

56:50.320 --> 56:52.760
Hello, caller, please state your name

56:52.760 --> 56:54.840
and affiliation for the record.

56:54.840 --> 56:57.120
You have one minute, your time begins now.

57:06.120 --> 57:07.280
Are you there, caller?

57:08.400 --> 57:09.400
What number is it?

57:14.040 --> 57:15.600
We need translation, I believe.

57:17.040 --> 57:20.120
Si, por favor, me diga su nombre

57:20.120 --> 57:23.600
y la relación del estudiante o de la escuela.

57:29.200 --> 57:30.720
Buenos dias.

57:30.720 --> 57:31.880
Si, me escucha?

57:32.560 --> 57:33.400
Hello.

57:34.640 --> 57:35.480
Hello.

57:35.480 --> 57:36.480
I can hear you, caller.

57:37.840 --> 57:39.360
Okay, no lo podemos escuchar.

57:39.360 --> 57:40.520
¿Tenemos una pregunta, señor?

57:44.760 --> 57:45.240
Si, por favor, me diga su nombre y la relación del estudiante o de la escuela.

57:45.240 --> 57:47.360
Si, por favor, me diga su nombre y la relación del estudiante o de la escuela.

57:47.360 --> 57:48.480
Si, por favor, me diga su nombre y la relación del estudiante o de la escuela.

57:48.480 --> 57:50.240
Tiene, hello.

57:52.240 --> 57:55.000
What's the phone number you're talking to?

57:57.960 --> 58:00.360
The last four numbers of this call

58:00.440 --> 58:01.440
are 2528.

58:01.440 --> 58:02.440
Okay, that's me.

58:02.440 --> 58:03.440
Thank you.

58:03.440 --> 58:04.440
My name is Alejandro Muñoz,

58:04.440 --> 58:06.440
and the information regarding the IB program

58:06.440 --> 58:07.440
is completely incorrect.

58:07.440 --> 58:10.440
There are schools surrounding our school

58:10.440 --> 58:13.440
that have maybe five, six hundred seniors

58:13.440 --> 58:15.440
of which maybe 20 are IB students.

58:15.440 --> 58:18.440
So it is in no way the same as the program

58:18.440 --> 58:21.440
that we offer where about 80% of the students are IB.

58:21.440 --> 58:24.440
So there is no place for these students to go

58:24.440 --> 58:26.440
if they do not renew this program.

58:26.440 --> 58:27.440
Please renew it.

58:27.440 --> 58:28.440
Thank you.

58:28.520 --> 58:29.520
Hello, caller.

58:29.520 --> 58:31.520
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

58:31.520 --> 58:32.520
You have one minute.

58:32.520 --> 58:34.520
Your time begins now.

58:39.520 --> 58:40.520
Hello, board members.

58:40.520 --> 58:41.520
My name is Elvia Delacruz,

58:41.520 --> 58:44.520
and I'm a teacher with Pepatec Los Angeles High School.

58:44.520 --> 58:47.520
I want to let you know we offer a rigorous curriculum

58:47.520 --> 58:48.520
to students to prepare them for college.

58:48.520 --> 58:51.520
Our team of dedicated teachers have done their best

58:51.520 --> 58:53.520
to ensure students apply for this program.

58:53.520 --> 58:54.520
Thank you.

58:54.600 --> 58:55.600
For college.

58:55.600 --> 58:57.600
Our team of dedicated teachers have done their best

58:57.600 --> 59:00.400
to ensure students apply their knowledge feels necessary

59:00.400 --> 59:02.400
to be successful citizens of the world.

59:02.400 --> 59:05.400
Our international baccalaureate program is unique

59:05.400 --> 59:08.600
in that it teaches our students how to be critical thinkers

59:08.600 --> 59:12.880
open minded on global issues risk takers caring inquires

59:12.880 --> 59:16.160
balanced knowledgeable communicators and principals

59:16.160 --> 59:19.440
skills that not all neighboring schools are equipped with.

59:20.240 --> 59:22.480
In turn many students of our senior class have been

59:22.480 --> 59:25.120
accepted to best universities in the nation such

59:25.120 --> 59:28.840
as John Hopkins University Duke Pepperdine Berkeley

59:28.840 --> 59:30.840
and USC to name a few.

59:30.840 --> 59:32.840
This speaks volume of our teachers and curriculum

59:32.840 --> 59:34.560
here at Pepatec Los Angeles High School.

59:34.560 --> 59:37.120
And our incoming students deserve the best education

59:37.120 --> 59:38.960
possible that this school offers.

59:38.960 --> 59:40.160
So please vote for you.

59:40.160 --> 59:41.760
A great school to remain open.

59:41.760 --> 59:42.760
Thank you.

59:46.680 --> 59:47.400
Hello, caller.

59:47.400 --> 59:49.920
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

59:49.920 --> 59:51.000
You have one minute.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.120
Your time begins now.

59:52.480 --> 01:00:00.080
Are you there, caller?

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:04.640
I am here.

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:05.600
One second, please.

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:07.440
I'm ready.

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.800
Tell me when to start.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.400
Please begin now.

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:13.760
My name is Nestor Enrique Valencia.

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.600
I'm the former council member and mayor here

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:17.040
in the city of Bell.

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:21.120
And I am also a former vice president of the parent

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:23.560
advisory board for LAUSD.

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:27.160
It is very, very saddening to see these recommendations come

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:28.920
to this fine school.

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:32.800
We need a school like this in the southeast.

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:37.680
They're very dedicated professionals at this school.

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:41.880
I understand the legislation that puts forth the rules

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:46.960
and regs for protecting the public interest

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:49.200
and the interests of the students.

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:53.280
This is not the case in this school.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:56.600
What I mean by that is this is not the reason

01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:59.760
to end a charter.

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:03.520
This school has its challenges like any other school,

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:06.280
any other public school.

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:08.080
I could also tell you that this school is very

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.080
engaged in our community.

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:13.480
And it is a prime example of this community.

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:14.200
Thank you, caller.

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:16.240
Your time is up.

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.440
Thank you so much for your time.

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:22.600
Hello, caller.

Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:26.240

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:27.320
Your time begins now.

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:35.560
Are you there, caller?

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:41.160
Hi, good morning, board members.

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:42.720
Can you hear me?

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:44.840
We can hear you.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:46.080
My name is Jeanette Santana.

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.680
I am a proud parent of a prep-a-tech high school

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:49.240
student.

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.560
Caller, you're welcome to call back in.

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:02.240
We're not certain what happened on the line.

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:08.360
Caller, please state your name and affiliation

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.200

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.280
You have one minute.

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:11.360
Your time begins now.

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:17.160
Are you there, caller?

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:33.520
Caller, please state your name and affiliation

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.320
for the record.

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:35.400
You have one minute.

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:36.600
Your time begins now.

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:43.200
Hello, caller.

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:46.200
Good morning.

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:48.560
Can you hear me?

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.560
Yes, caller, we can hear you.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:51.080
Good morning.

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:55.680
My name is Maria Gonzalez, and I represent three students

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:58.640
at Alta Public School.

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:00.840
I'm the mother of three children in the Alta Public

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:01.520
School system.

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:04.120
My eldest, who is now a freshman at a prep-a-tech high school,

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:07.080
has been a part of the Alta family for the past six years.

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:09.480
I cannot put into words the satisfaction and relief

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:12.360
we felt as a community, knowing that our children now

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:15.280
have the opportunity to have the complete academic

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:20.080
experience in the only school family some have known.

01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:22.880
The added benefits of having an elementary, middle school,

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:25.600
and now a high school with an IB learner program

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.720
is something unique to this community.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.880
Part of LA USD's mission statement

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:32.920
is that it will be a progressive global leader in education,

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:35.720
providing a dynamic and inspiring learning experience

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:38.160
where all students graduate ready for success.

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:39.680
Ladies and gentlemen of the board,

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:41.720
you have before you the opportunity

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:44.600
to prove this mission statement true today.

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:47.920
The renewal of this high school is an investment

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:48.960
in this community.

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:52.560
Doing so ensures a great successful future for our kids.

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:53.060
Thank you.

01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:57.560
Hello, caller.

01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:00.040
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.200
You have one minute.

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.320
Your time begins now.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:08.520
Good morning.

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:11.040
My name is Amelia Nguyen, and I teach language and literature.

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:12.760
This is my third year at Prepatech

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.480
and 10th year in education, and I want

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:16.520
to promote this school for renewal.

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.320
Bringing IB to this particular community

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.080
is a huge undertaking.

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.560
I hold a teaching credential and master's in education

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:23.240
from UC Davis.

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:24.360
Go Aggies.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.860
But even with my previous training,

01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:29.360
it is taking years of work and immense financial investment

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:33.360
to synthesize the many facets that make up an IB education

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:36.480
in a culturally responsive way that is specific to the needs

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:37.680
of our students.

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:39.320
When I started at PEPA, we struggled

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:41.360
to retain skilled teachers due to the pay

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:43.760
skill differences from surrounding districts.

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:46.440
Now that we are comparable, our teachers are staying

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:48.400
and learning the IB framework.

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:51.160
I can say with assurance that IB education here

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:53.760
at PEPA is amazing and Prepatech is the scrappiest

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.440
school I have ever seen.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.800
Our test scores only show where we are starting.

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:00.680
And I love the IB framework because it aims

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:02.520
to serve the students where they are and help

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:05.000
them become global, thoughtful, and reflective citizens.

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:07.440
We have learned so much over the last five years

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.320
and the amount of growth I've seen in both staff

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:10.680
and students is immeasurable.

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:11.840
Thank you, caller.

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:12.640
Your time is up.

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:14.720
Thank you so much for your time.

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:18.240
Hello, caller.

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:20.760
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:21.880
You have one minute.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:22.880
Your time begins now.

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:32.360
Are you there, caller?

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:38.560
Hello.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:39.560
You're there.

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:40.560
Can you hear me?

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:41.680
Yes, we can hear you, caller.

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:43.880
Good morning.

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:45.200
My name is Viviana Matamoros.

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:47.240
I am a community member for the past 30 years

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.080
and also work at Prepatech Middle School.

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:51.120
I am here to ask for your support to renew one

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:53.440
of our public sister schools, Prepatech High School,

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.760
as we have become officially one of the first

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:58.880
international baccalaureate K-12 school in LA district

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.840
that is free completely to every single student

01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:02.200
that attends our school.

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:03.280
What does this mean?

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.720
For one, that the investment that the school has done

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:07.880
on facilities, IB trained teachers,

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:09.760
and other requirements for this program

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:11.320
was a great investment,

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:13.920
and it is starting to show with positive results.

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.440
We need to allow the school to grow to its full potential

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:18.120
and to keep in mind that great schools

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:19.960
are not just built in five years.

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:21.160
We are starting to bloom,

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.600
and it shows in the high percentage

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:25.760
of graduating students going to UC St. Cal State.

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:27.880
Here, every student is offered an opportunity

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.880
to be an IB student and dream big,

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.600
so they strive for a great future

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:33.680
and are able to have the American dream,

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:35.600
a great education for success.

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.280
Our kids and future generations for our community

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:41.040
deserve to have an IB school just as any world community,

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:43.360
and this is what we are asking for,

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:44.640
for you guys to renew the school

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:45.960
because our community deserves it.

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:46.800
Thank you, caller, your time is up.

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:48.560
And many of us have waited for this.

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:49.400
Thank you.

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:53.840
Hello, caller, please state your name

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:55.400
and affiliation for the record.

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:56.560
You have one minute.

01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:57.880
Your time begins now.

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:04.040
Hi, my name is Marissa Ruscon,

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:06.120
and I serve as the expanded learning program manager

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:07.760
with the Alta Public Schools.

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:09.080
Prepa Tech surrounds its students

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:10.720
with support, love, and guidance daily,

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:13.680
creating an environment that students can grow and flourish

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:15.280
with dedicated faculty and staff

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:16.640
that keep the needs of our families

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:18.840
at the forefront of every decision.

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.840
We invested time and resources

01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:22.880
to ensure that all students are provided

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:25.680
with quality learning experiences and opportunities

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:28.320
to develop personally and academically.

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:31.040
Our IB program is one of four in LUSD

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:33.480
and brings a unique and special learning opportunity

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:35.840
to students by preparing them for success

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:37.800
in their next step to college and career

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:40.040
with a high graduation and acceptance rate

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:42.000
to a four-year college and university,

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
the highest in our community.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.240
Prepa Tech is creating true global citizens

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:47.720
with the skills and tools needed

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:50.240
to impact not only in the Southeast LA community

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:53.640
but the world because Prepa Tech students have the pride,

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:55.160
the rigor, the leadership,

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:56.920
and the love for their family and community

01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:58.240
to be the change.

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.360
Please consider the renewal of Prepa Tech High School

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:03.520
as not only an investment into the future of our students

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:05.560
but as an investment into our community.

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:06.400
Thank you, Paula.

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:07.240
Your time is up.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.040
Hello, caller.

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:14.520
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.520
You have one minute.

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:16.880
Your time begins now.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.520
Hello.

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:24.800
We can hear you.

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:25.640
Hello.

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:26.480
Yes, good morning.

01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:27.320
Can you hear me?

01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:31.640
Yes, I can hear you.

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:32.480
Good morning.

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:34.800
Please give us your name.

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:35.920
Can you hear me well?

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.840
Can you give us your name

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:40.880
and the student's affiliation or the school's name, please?

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:43.680
Yes, my name is Marta Barajas

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:46.280
and I have two students in Prepa Tech.

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:49.680
One has two of her kids.

01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:53.360
And the other one is in grade nine.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:57.880
And the reason for my call is because I'm asking the board

01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:01.880
members to please renew the Prepa Tech High School contract

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:04.880
because my kids have been there for a while.

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:06.720
Please wait a moment.

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.640
She's got two kids at the school

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:12.040
and she would like to request that the school be renewed.

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:15.560
Please continue.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:18.880
Yes, the level of learning that my kids have had

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:22.880
in Prepa Tech High School is the same as in Prepa Tech High School.

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:24.440
The school is of high quality.

01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:27.040
It's as if they had it in a private school.

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:31.040
And really, if you don't approve the renewal of the contract,

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:32.280
it would be terrible for me.

01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:36.240
It's like knocking on my kids' door when they arrive at the university

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:41.080
because they are having an excellent education.

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:44.240
My kids have pure health and a program like this.

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:45.680
Please wait a moment.

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:50.760
She said that her kids are receiving an excellent education

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:51.880
there at the school.

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:57.880
Do you have more?

01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:02.880
Yes, and I'm really desperate because now that I know they're not renewing it,

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:06.880
I ask you to please help my kids arrive at the university

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:09.880
by approving Prepa Tech High School.

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:10.880
Yes, please.

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:13.880
She would like to say that she wants the school to be renewed

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:17.880
so her kids can go to a university.

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:22.880
I travel from Long Beach to Huntington Park every day.

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:26.880
She travels from Long Beach to Huntington every day.

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:28.880
For 11 years.

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:31.880
For the last 11 years.

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:35.880
Please continue.

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:36.880
Yes, please.

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:41.880
They are excellent teachers of high quality, excellent staff,

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:44.880
and really, they listen to the voice of the parents,

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:47.880
not the people who are against it.

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:50.880
I am very happy with Prepa Tech High School.

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:53.880
Please wait a moment.

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:56.880
She just said that the teachers are excellent.

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:57.880
Thank you very much.

01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:00.880
Please listen to the parents.

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:03.880
That's time. Thank you.

01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:08.880
Hello, caller.

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:10.880
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:11.880
You have one minute.

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:14.880
Your time begins now.

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:19.880
Good morning, board members.

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:20.880
My name is Linda Vargas.

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:22.880
As an Alta Public Schools employee,

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:24.880
I've had the privilege to work alongside dedicated staff,

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:27.880
but more importantly, our students and families.

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:29.880
Our students and families are so committed and eager to excel

01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:30.880
and learn.

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:33.880
The rigor offered by our RB program is available to each

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:35.880
and every one of our students.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:37.880
It is not exclusive to the families that can pay for it.

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:40.880
Why should our children not have the right to this program?

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:43.880
Tuition for another K-12 continuing school in the Santa Monica

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:46.880
area is approximately $21,000 per year.

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:49.880
Ninety-five percent of our families are socially, economically

01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:52.880
disadvantaged and would be unable to afford giving their

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:54.880
children that type of education.

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:57.880
The early investment made for our new building early on is

01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:00.880
evident within the Prepa Tech High School hallways where our

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:03.880
students find teachers and staff that encourage, motivate,

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:05.880
and push them past fears into greater heights.

01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:09.880
Last year, our graduating class had an 89.3 percent graduation

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:10.880
rate.

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:13.880
I urge you to renew Prepa Tech High School and allow this

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:16.880
cocoon to flourish into the bright and beautiful butterfly

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.880
our community needs and deserves.

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:23.880
Thank you for your time.

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:24.880
Hello, caller.

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.880
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:27.880
You have one minute.

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:35.880
Your time begins now.

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:36.880
Good morning.

01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:39.880
My name is Julia Longo, and I am proud to be the diploma

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:41.880
program coordinator for Prepa Tech.

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:45.880
We are one of only a handful of IB schools in the LA area,

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:49.880
and there is no other continuing school in the area which

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:52.880
provides continuity of the IB curriculum from its primary

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:55.880
years and middle years programs to the diploma programs in

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:57.880
grades 11 through 12.

01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:01.880
Unlike most schools, we do this at zero cost to our families.

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:04.880
This rigorous educational opportunity enables students to

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:07.880
enter four-year colleges with tuition credits equivalent up

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:09.880
to one year.

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:12.880
Not only our families, but the nationally and internationally

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:15.880
respected WASC and IB organizations have attested that

01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:18.880
we are providing a quality education to our students.

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:21.880
Test scores do not demonstrate what is truly being achieved at

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:22.880
Prepa Tech.

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:26.880
The renewal of the Prepa Tech charter is in the best interest

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:28.880
of our historically disadvantaged students.

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:36.880
Thank you.

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:37.880
Hello, caller.

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.880
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:40.880
You have one moment.

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:47.880
Your time begins now.

01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:49.880
Hello.

01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:50.880
We can hear you.

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:51.880
Okay.

01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:52.880
Hi.

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:53.880
My name is Naomi Cuevas.

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:56.880
I am the mother of a proud student who attends the high school.

01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:00.880
As a proud parent, I am imploring the renewal of our high school.

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:04.880
I have firsthand experienced the growth that my daughter has had academically.

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:07.880
I moved my daughter from the Downey Unified to give her the

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:11.880
opportunity of this unique IB program the school offers.

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:14.880
This IB program the school offers is not offered anywhere else,

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:16.880
which I looked.

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:19.880
Prepa Tech Los Angeles is an important step in our low-income

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:23.880
community to have a chance to a better education, to a brighter future.

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:26.880
Let us remember our students are the future of this country,

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:30.880
therefore require the best education, and Prepa Tech offers that.

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:35.880
It will be crucial and devastating to our community and a great loss

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:38.880
if our children were to lose the opportunity.

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:42.880
Please consider the renewal for Prepa Tech High School.

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:47.880
Thank you very much for your time.

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:48.880
Hello, caller.

01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:57.880
Hello.

01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:59.880
Good morning.

01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:01.880
Please repeat.

01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:06.880
Please state your name and affiliation and don't forget to pause after each

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:08.880
sentence to be able to translate.

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:10.880
Yes, thank you very much.

01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:11.880
Good morning.

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:13.880
My name is Maria Campos.

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:14.880
Good morning.

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:16.880
My name is Maria Campos.

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:42.920
I am a mother of a student at Prepa

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:44.880
Tech High School.

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:47.040
for the renewal of Prepatec High School.

01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:00.040
For me and my daughter Prepatec High School

01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:02.000
is very important for the school to continue.

01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:13.160
This is what our community needs not just

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:15.120
for my daughter but for the rest of the students.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.200
They have excellent teachers.

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:34.120
They have the IB program which is extremely important.

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:56.000
For me and for the community the renewal of this school

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.040
is extremely important so that they continue

01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.320
to prepare our students.

01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:05.560
So that they can go to the university.

01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:08.320
This is their future. The future is within our youth.

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:15.840
Hello, caller.

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:18.360
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:20.560
You have one minute. Your time begins now.

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:28.200
Good morning.

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:33.680
Good morning. Please say your name and affiliation.

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:37.040
And don't forget to pause to be able to translate.

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.960
Okay. My name is Esther Garcia.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.280
My name is Esther Garcia.

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:55.960
I am thankful with God and for Prepatec for helping my daughter

01:17:55.960 --> 01:18:04.840
and getting her best potential with regards to her education.

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:19.960
For me Prepatec, all of the school staff and teachers

01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:22.680
provide their best efforts so that students

01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:24.120
provide their best efforts.

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:41.160
Teachers prepare students very well for life

01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:44.920
and for university which is what concerns me the most.

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:50.040
I want my daughter to go to a university

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:51.320
and they do a great job at it.

01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:07.960
It would be a terrible loss for students

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:10.600
if Prepatec High School was not renewed.

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:13.560
So I please beg that you renew Prepatec High School.

01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:27.320
My daughter is very excited for what is to come

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:29.160
with with regards to universities

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:31.400
and I am very excited for her as well.

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:33.480
So if Prepatec High School closes down

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:35.800
this would be a big loss for her.

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:39.160
That's time caller.

01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:49.800
Hello caller please state your name

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:51.480

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:53.720

01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:01.880

01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:13.320
Yes the caller with the number 2089 on the line.

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.440
Yes hi my name is Leticia Bernal.

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:18.520
I have a student at Prepatec

01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:21.400
and I would like to say to you to consider

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:24.120
the renewal for the Bermuda Prepatec.

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:27.880
So they can keep teachers and workers there.

01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:31.400
Their teachers are amazing and they provide good work

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:32.600
for the kids.

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:34.280
They help my kids through the work

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:39.160
and if you dismiss the opportunity

01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:42.840
the kids are going to go like unfortunate

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:45.560
and I would like you to keep their dreams up.

01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:48.280
I would like you to know to permit please.

01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:49.160
Thank you so much.

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:52.200

01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:08.120
Hello.

01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:11.560
We can hear you caller please begin.

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:14.600
My name is Jenci Baroccio.

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:16.840
I have two students at Prepatec a high school

01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:17.800
and a junior high.

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:21.400
I would like to for you guys to touch your heart

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:22.840
and renew the school.

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:26.360
Come closer we still need the school open.

01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:29.400
My daughter is doing great.

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:30.920
They help her a lot.

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:32.840
They have good teachers good staff.

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:36.120
And they have control over the kids.

01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:39.640
Please renew the school for five years more.

01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:40.520
Don't close it.

01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:44.680
Touch your heart and donate to students without school.

01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:45.960
Thank you for hearing us.

01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:47.560
Thank you caller.

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:51.560
Hello caller please state your name

01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:53.320
and affiliation for the record.

01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:55.560
You have one minute. Your time begins now.

01:21:55.560 --> 01:22:07.240
Hello hello my name is Jimmy Luna.

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:09.240
I'm a senior student from Prepatec high school

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:11.160
and I've been with it for all the four years

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:12.600
and I can tell you with confidence

01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:15.320
that the school is worth keeping open.

01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:17.240
You know I'm not exactly sure what the situation here

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:18.440
and I don't know what it's costing

01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:19.400
but I can tell you one thing

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:21.640
and that's that you can't put in a price on education

01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:23.240
that builds leadership in human beings.

01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:25.560
Prepatec is an IB school

01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:27.080
and it's different than the rest of the schools

01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:28.040
and that's what makes it great.

01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:31.400
Students are shown they are more than a score in a system

01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:32.760
and they are shown they are human beings

01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:34.120
that can change the world for the better.

01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:37.720
Prepatec must be kept open as the choice is bigger than me

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:39.960
than my friends and all of us really

01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:42.760
as it's the type of choice that the type of decision

01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:44.760
that decides where our future in this country lies.

01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:46.840
The decision that changes our future.

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:49.000
Do we want society who advances and grows

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.480
or do we want society that is never willing to change

01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:53.480
especially its educational system.

01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:55.080
Today we are deciding what type of schools

01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:56.920
we want our children to graduate from

01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:59.080
and stop being children to become adults.

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:00.600
Closing the school that teaches our children

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:01.800
what it means to be an adult

01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:03.560
and what it means to be a good human being

01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:05.640
what it means to contribute to society

01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:06.760
is the wrong decision.

01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:08.280
You can't build a country out of workers.

01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:09.000
You need leaders.

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:18.760
Hello caller please state your name

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:20.360
and affiliation for the record.

01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:22.680
You have one minute. Your time begins now.

01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:30.840
Hi my name is Andrea Gavez

01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:33.000
and I'm a senior at Prepatec High School

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.960
and Prepa has helped me in so many ways

01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:38.360
and the teachers here are amazing

01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:41.720
and they do everything in their power to see us succeed.

01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:46.200
I am now going to graduate and I'm going to college.

01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:47.800
Prepa has changed me

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:51.080
and I see myself growing as a person.

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:52.620
Thank you.

01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:54.440
Thank you caller.

01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:58.760
Hello caller please state your name

01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:00.520
and affiliation for the record.

01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:02.760
You have one minute. Your time begins now.

01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:08.760
This is Katlyn O'Halloran

01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:11.000
with the Charter Schools Development Center.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.960
CSDC supports the renewal of Prepatec.

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:16.440
New charter schools often struggle financially

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:17.960
as they get established.

01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:21.000
Our review of the school's current financials

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.520
show that they now appear to have sound fiscal footing.

01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:29.800
CSDC commends Prepatec on achieving authorization

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:32.920
for the international baccalaureate diploma program

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:35.320
because it's a rarity in low income areas.

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:38.920
As a new school Prepatec has only one year

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:40.920
of academic state indicator data

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:43.000
and we know this is not much to go on.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.800
Renewal would let the school establish a track record

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:49.080
and provide continuity rather than forcing a school change

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:52.040
on students already highly affected by the pandemic.

01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:53.640
We also want to alert you

01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:55.080
that we're seeing a disturbing trend

01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:57.640
where authorizers rely solely on comparisons

01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:59.560
of schools to state averages.

01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:01.560
This sets up schools like Prepatec,

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:04.680
schools that bring in many students with low baselines

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:05.960
to appear poor performing

01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:08.360
irrespective of actual student growth.

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:08.860
Thank you.

01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:10.920
Thank you caller.

01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:14.280
Hello, caller.

01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:16.760
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:17.960
You have one minute.

01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:19.160
Your time begins now.

01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:25.160
Hi, my name is Robert Bates

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:28.520
and I teach both history and world religions

01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:29.960
here at Prepatec.

01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:31.560
This is a wonderful school.

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:33.880
It allows students to get college credit

01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:38.120
while in high school in two year long programs

01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:39.720
like the ones I teach.

01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:43.160
These programs are coordinated with all the other classes

01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:45.080
through a theory of knowledge class

01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:47.000
in which they learn how to learn.

01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:50.680
It would be a shame if the school is closed

01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:54.920
because I see so many young people moving on to college,

01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:57.800
moving on to very good colleges because of this program.

01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:58.680
Thank you for your time.

01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:00.840
Thank you, caller.

01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:05.320
Hello, caller.

01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:07.880
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:08.920
You have one minute.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.120
Your time begins now.

01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:17.800
Good morning board members.

01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:19.000
My name is Marcy Messon.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.240
I'm a proud staff member at the Prepatec High School

01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:24.360
who started off as a pair of volunteer over 10 years ago.

01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:27.240
I've lived in this community for and nearby communities

01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:28.680
for over 40 years in my life.

01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:31.000
I just want to remind everyone the reason

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.680
for the schools exist in the first place

01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:35.160
is due to the schools in our communities failing us

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.400
and our children for decades until some parents

01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:40.120
and teachers who actually cared about the students

01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:42.200
decided to take matters into their own hands

01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:44.200
and create better schools for our communities.

01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:47.720
My kids whom my oldest daughters are over 20 years old

01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:50.840
attended the failing public schools nearby

01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.120
and I volunteered to them.

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:58.200
What I saw in my volunteer experience was that the LAUSD

01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:01.640
didn't care about the students they were appointed to serve.

01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:05.320
After hearing about charter schools I was so relieved

01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:07.320
that my children won't finally be attending schools

01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:10.040
that were safe and actually cares about their students.

01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:12.120
The International Baccalaureate program here

01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:16.840
teaches positive character building skills as well

01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:19.720
as has a vigorous curriculum to help our children

01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:21.480
achieve their dreams.

01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:21.800
Thank you.

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:22.760
Thank you for your time.

01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:24.920
Thank you.

01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:28.600
Hello caller.

01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:31.080
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:32.120
You have one minute.

01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:33.320
Your time begins now.

01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:38.520
Hello.

01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:39.960
My name is Anthony Quiñones.

01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:41.240
I'm a teacher at Prepa Tech.

01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:43.560
Prepa Tech is unique.

01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:46.840
Most charter schools just find a building for their students

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:48.360
or they rent something.

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:51.320
Prepa Tech went the extra mile to find a facility

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.840
make that a home for our students.

01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:55.800
This should not be the undoing of their program.

01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:57.800
We've improved our finances in recent years

01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:01.400
and frankly even though students can go to other schools

01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:05.160
they cannot achieve the same experience that they get

01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:06.520
Thank you.

01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:08.440
Thank you caller.

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:12.760
Hello caller.

01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:15.160
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:16.280
You have one minute.

01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:17.400
Your time begins now.

01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:27.960
Are you there caller?

01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:29.480
Hi. Yes I am.

01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:29.880
Hello.

01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:31.880
Good morning members of the State Board of Education.

01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:34.440
My name is Dean Higley and I am the science teacher

01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:35.720
at Prepa Tech High School.

01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:38.600
I'm calling to urge you to reauthorize

01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:39.560
Prepa Tech High School.

01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:42.840
As a science teacher having a functioning lab

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:46.280
stations is essential for conducting labs safely

01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:47.000
and correctly.

01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:50.280
Labs are the practical application of science concepts

01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:51.800
and provide hands-on opportunities

01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:52.920
to make science come to life.

01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:56.440
Prior to working at Alta Public Schools

01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:58.760
I worked at three other charter schools

01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:01.640
and in none of those was there a functioning lab station.

01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:03.640
If students needed water for a lab

01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:05.800
they would have to go to the restroom to go get that water.

01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:07.800
Not a good situation.

01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:12.040
However at Prepa Tech fully functional lab stations

01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:12.680
were installed.

01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:16.360
This shows Mr. Reyes's and Alta Public Schools dedication

01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:17.880
to providing world-class education

01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:20.040
to the Prepa Tech High School students.

01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:23.640
Alta Public Schools is deeply concerned with making sure

01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:26.520
students have every opportunity available to increase learning

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:28.920
and they put their money where their mouth is to assure this.

01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:30.520
Thank you for your time.

01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:31.160
Have a good day.

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:32.520
Thank you caller.

01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:35.720
Hello caller.

01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:38.280
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:39.400
You have one minute.

01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:40.600
Your time begins now.

01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:45.400
Good morning.

01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:47.640
My name is Michael Jubas speaking on behalf

01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:49.640
of the California Teachers Association.

01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:54.280
CTA supports CDE's recommendation to not renew

01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:55.880
Prepa Tech Los Angeles High.

01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:59.880
While CDE's position matches the local district's decision

01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:03.480
to not renew the petition there is still concern

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:07.800
that the CDE's approach to renewals of SBE authorized

01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:10.760
charters is undermining the authority granted

01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:14.200
by the state legislator to the local district

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:15.560
during the renewal process.

01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:20.360
In December 2020 the board of LAUSD unanimously voted

01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:22.760
to deny Prepa Tech's renewal position

01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:25.000
and the district staff laid out several findings

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.320
that supported denying the renewal.

01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:31.400
Additionally LAUSD submitted a notice of violation

01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:33.640
to Prepa Tech in October 2020.

01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:39.480
CTA believes that under AB 1505 the legislature intended

01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:43.320
for it to be the local district's duty to conduct

01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:46.920
a thorough and comprehensive review of these renewals.

01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:47.640
Thank you caller.

01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:48.520
Your time is up.

01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:51.560
Hello caller.

01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:53.960
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:55.080
You have one minute.

01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:56.280
Your time begins now.

01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:03.000
Hi can you hear me.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.360
You can hear you caller.

01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:07.080
Hi my name is Elta Ochoa.

01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:09.400
I'm the proud one and only assistant principal

01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:11.160
of Prepa Tech High School and I recommend

01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:12.760
our charter school renewal.

01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:15.720
Our team is committed to providing a quality education

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:18.200
too and narrowing the education the achievement

01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:19.240
gap for our students.

01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:22.600
Last year our graduation rate was 89.3 percent.

01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:25.080
Meanwhile the state was 86.6 percent.

01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:27.960
This number illustrates the hard work our teachers do

01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:30.760
to scaffold and personalize our students' learning

01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:32.680
in our small class sizes.

01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:35.560
Our educators are invested in this community and equity

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:38.200
for our students who are predominantly Latino

01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:39.000
and low income.

01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:42.440
It is important to note that our school has primarily

01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:45.080
spent its budget on facilities and personnel.

01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:46.760
This shows that we are person-centered

01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:48.360
and invest in the future.

01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:51.640
We can fully remedy our financial situation but you

01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:54.840
cannot fix the repercussions of a denial today.

01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:57.560
Reminder we are in a global pandemic.

01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:00.680
Closing our school will devastate 400 Prepa Tech

01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:03.720
staff and students along with all of our ALTA students

01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:06.280
who look forward to doing their education with us.

01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:07.320
Thank you.

01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:10.600
Hello caller.

01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:15.480
Your time begins now.

01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:23.480
Hi this is Dr.

01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:24.600
Sharisa Vitter.

01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:26.360
Professor Ivey Education.

01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:29.160
According to the Ivey school site California has only

01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:31.400
a handful of continuum Ivey programs.

01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:33.640
Prepa Tech is the culmination of this program

01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:36.040
and the incorporation of the CB will make it the first

01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:37.080
in the state.

01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:39.240
The core of the international baccalaureate is learning

01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:41.640
how to learn which gives students agency over

01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:42.760
their own learning.

01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:44.840
Ivey students are known to be problem solvers,

01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:47.560
critical thinkers making them successful for university

01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:48.840
or the workforce.

01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:52.840
As for university acceptance Caltech has an 8% acceptance

01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:56.280
rate that accepts 23.8% of Ivey students.

01:32:56.280 --> 01:32:59.640
University of California Los Angeles has an 18% acceptance

01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:03.240
rate but 41.4% of Ivey students.

01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:07.320
University of California San Diego with a 35.9% acceptance

01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:10.360
rate takes 60.7% of Ivey students.

01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:14.520
Since there is a continuum and Prepa Tech is the culmination

01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:18.200
2020 we looked at PYP schools to find a greater impact

01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:19.880
on social emotional learning.

01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:24.120
NYP students are 34% more likely to take advanced courses

01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:25.080
in high school.

01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:28.840
And California's programs are serving low income students.

01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:34.280

01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:45.480

01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:55.720
Caller with a phone number ending with 9314.

01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:56.600

Is it me?

01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:18.760
It is you.

01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:21.960
Hi my name is Maurice Nicholson.

01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:23.720
I'm a parent.

01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:27.640
I have a daughter that I planned on going to Prepa Tech

01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:31.240
next semester so I'm just hoping the school gets renewed.

01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:34.520
I want to say thank you and have a great day.

01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:36.200
Thank you caller.

01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:42.600
Hello caller please state your name and affiliation

01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:43.480
for the record.

01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:44.680
You have one minute.

01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:45.800
Your time begins now.

01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:51.320
Hi my name is Sarah Tuxbury.

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:53.720
I'm a Marin County resident and I want to say

01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:55.720
that your review process for Prepa Tech

01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:57.640
and the two other SBE authorized charters

01:34:57.640 --> 01:35:00.120
is broken, inconsistent, and prejudicial.

01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:03.320
You selectively use or ignore AB 1505.

01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:06.120
Ms. Saez said yesterday that the CDE did not use

01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:08.040
the district reports at all so I don't understand

01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:10.360
why you make them do a review which is very expensive

01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:11.880
and waste district resources.

01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:14.440
You approved the Ross Valley charter

01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:16.440
which is really no different than Prepa Tech.

01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:19.320
They both rely heavily on debt so I'd like to ask you

01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:21.720
to pause your reviews and fix your process

01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:23.880
and make it more consistent and fair.

01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:24.280
Thank you.

01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:25.960
Thank you caller.

01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:31.320
Hello caller please state your name

01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:33.160

01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:35.480
Your time begins now.

01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:42.040
Are you there caller?

01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:48.280
Hello is this the caller 3916?

01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:50.600
This is 3916 yes.

01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:54.040
Hello my name is Kaye Reinhart.

01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:57.480
I'm a special ed teacher at Prepa Tech Middle School.

01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:00.440
I had the privilege to be the DIS counselor

01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:02.760
for special ed students after high school.

01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:07.400
This school is more committed to students

01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:09.640
and their progress than any school I've

01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:11.480
worked with in 30 years.

01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:14.760
The IB program offers them opportunities

01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:18.360
that are not afforded to students in this area

01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:22.040
and I urge you to please consider special ed students

01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:25.640
and all students in this area and to keep Prepa Tech

01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:27.480
open for another five years.

01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:30.040
I've never worked with more committed educators

01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:34.120
and I'm just in shock that it would even be considered

01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:35.560
to close this school.

01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:36.520
Thank you for your time.

01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:38.280
Thank you caller.

01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:42.360
Hello caller please state your name

01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:44.040
and affiliation for the record.

01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:45.240
You have one minute.

01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:46.440
Your time begins now.

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:55.320
Hi my name is Yvonne Tenejas.

01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:57.880
I'm the parent of the student at Prepa Tech High School

01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:00.520
who have attended up to school since they first opened.

01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:04.520
As an educator myself education is very important to me

01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:05.320
and my family.

01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:08.760
Finding a quality high school is very difficult task

01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:09.720
in this community.

01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:13.160
Finding one is a blessing and Prepa Tech has been a blessing

01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:15.240
for my community and my family.

01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:21.160
Its exceptional IB program has prepared my children

01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:22.280
for higher education.

01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:24.840
The teachers and staff are amazing.

01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:26.760
Consequently it was a dream of Mr.

01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:28.760
Ray's and all of those who make this possible

01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:33.720
that have worked so hard to give our children this blessing.

01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:37.720
Please I ask that you will please keep the school open

01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:40.760
and be part of the success of our children in our community.

01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:44.680
Otherwise you would be showing us that you don't really care

01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:47.160
to give us the opportunity to give our children

01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:48.520
higher education.

01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:49.020
Thank you.

01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:51.160
Thank you caller.

01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:57.720
Hello caller please state your name and affiliation

01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:58.600
for the record.

01:37:58.600 --> 01:37:59.800
You have one minute.

01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:01.000
Your time begins now.

01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:09.720
Hello my name is Elias Carrera and I'm a senior

01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:14.680
and I just want to say that I this school right here

01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:17.480
is has given me the opportunity to not only grow

01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:20.200
from education but also in life as well.

01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:24.600
And I can only I can't imagine you know this school

01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:26.440
being closed down for future generations

01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:29.560
that have been in my position Latino in this community

01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:31.800
to not have this opportunity such as myself.

01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:33.720
And this school has given me an opportunity to go

01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:36.840
to places that I could never have imagined back then.

01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:39.080
I always imagined I would have to go to community college

01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:41.160
and et cetera but now I'm going to Cal State Lane going

01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:45.080
on to even an internship for NASA and et cetera.

01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:47.640
And I honestly just the school has given me things

01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:50.760
like TOK which has allowed me to question

01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:52.760
and also view life in a different perspective

01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:54.360
and different manner of being as well.

01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:58.520
And the teachers beyond care for us as students as well

01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:00.760
and not only for education but also for our personal

01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:01.560
lives as well.

01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:04.840
And I I wish and I hope that this school can be renewed

01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:07.480
so that others in the future in my position can also be

01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:09.640
have this opportunity as well.

01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:10.600
Please thank you thank you.

01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:13.160
I beg you please help me.

01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:19.480
Hello caller please state your name and affiliation

Your time begins now.

01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:30.600
Hi can you hear me.

01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:32.600
Yes caller we can hear you.

01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:33.240
Please begin.

01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:36.680
Hi good morning my name is Yesena Guerrero.

01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:40.200
I am a parent of a student in our sister school

01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:41.880
Academia Moderna Elementary.

01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:44.120
He and my family moved from the San Fernando Valley

01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:47.000
to Los Angeles to be able to have our son attend

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.480
a school that offers the IB primary program.

01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:51.880
Even though he has been doing school we assume

01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:55.640
we have been pleased with his academic achievements

01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:58.440
and progress and may I add he has been blessed

01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:00.680
with one of the most amazing kindergarten teachers

01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:01.480
Mrs. Bello.

01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:04.040
I would like for my son to have the opportunity

01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:07.160
of having an IB education from elementary all the way

01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:09.000
up to his senior year of high school.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.480
Please don't shut our dreams of a higher education

01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:14.200
in a low income area that is so well needed.

01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:16.520
That is one of the reasons why our funder Mr.

01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:19.320
Javier Reyes has invested in our programs that touch

01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:22.600
an early age for our kids so they can have a higher chance

01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:25.160
of success and become who they want to be in life.

01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:28.520
Full of confidence and very knowledgeable and nothing less.

01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:31.400
I am asking to please renew our school our community

01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:34.120
parents and most importantly our students our future

01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:37.000
and future generations that are having a better education.

01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:41.880
Hello caller please state your name and affiliation

01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:42.840
for the record.

01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:43.880
You have one minute.

01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:45.560
Your time begins now.

01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:53.880
Hi my name is Matthew Welles and I'm a science teacher

01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:55.800
at Prebacat High School.

01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:58.200
I'm calling to support the renewal of the school.

01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:01.720
Like the caller said before a science lab is necessary

01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:04.200
for our students to obtain that edge over students

01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:07.240
in LA USD and other charter schools and with the

01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:09.800
completion of our new science lab we now have all

01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:12.280
the necessary materials for our students to be successful

01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:14.120
academically in the sciences.

01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:17.160
So I would encourage you to please renew Prebacat High

01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:19.960
School and support our students developing science

01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:23.160
as they continue to conduct research and do other

01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:25.800
experiments that will give them an edge over the rest

01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:26.840
of the community.

01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:27.240
Thank you.

01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:28.760
Thank you caller.

01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:34.040
Hello caller please state your name and affiliation

01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:36.120

01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:51.720
Hello.

01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:52.760
Yes I am here.

01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:55.080
Hi my name is Glenda Ademan.

01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:57.560
I'm one of the directors here at Alta Public Schools

01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:01.960
and I want to urge the board to renew Prebatec Los Angeles.

01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:07.160
The CDE and LA USD presenters have brought up concerns

01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:10.040
about Prebatec's historical financials.

01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:12.600
I want to affirm that our leadership staff takes

01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:15.880
the financial health of the organization very seriously

01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:19.000
and we meet often to discuss our financial situation

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.920
and how to improve our bottom line.

01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:23.080
You can see this commitment in that our financials

01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:24.440
are improving rapidly.

01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:26.920
We have had to make hard decisions about what to cut

01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:29.160
to improve our financials without hurting our

01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:30.200
students' education.

01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:35.800
The CDE and LA USD has stated that we do not demonstratively

01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:37.960
show the ability to manage our financials.

01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:40.200
However I believe this to be untrue.

01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:43.080
We have contracted with financial experts who work

01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:45.640
with many other successful charter schools who support us.

01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:48.360
In addition our two other schools do not demonstrate

01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:50.040
similar financial issues.

01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:53.720
Thus there is capacity to run a fiscally solvent program.

01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:56.280
Again I urge the board to renew Prebatec Los Angeles.

01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:57.000
Thank you caller.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.040
Your time is now.

01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:00.200
To continue providing a much needed education.

01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:00.520
Thank you.

01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:05.080
Hello caller please state your name and affiliation

01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:05.960
for the record.

01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:07.160
You have one minute.

01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:08.280
Your time begins now.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.480
Hello my name is Lauren and I'm a senior at Prebatec

01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:18.360
and I strongly urge you to renew our school.

01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:21.080
Someone mentioned the closure of the school is in the best

01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:25.160
interest of the students and as a student I strongly disagree.

01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:27.320
IB program while groundbreaking and innovative

01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:30.360
has historically been for students in affluent areas.

01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:33.880
But Prebatec is bringing this program to underserved youth

01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:36.440
and is providing us with opportunities we could never

01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:37.400
imagine.

01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:40.360
I never thought I could meet with official United Nations

01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:43.240
ambassadors all the way in New York or receive

01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:46.360
the Congressional Gold Medal the only youth award provided

01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:48.120
by the United States Congress.

01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:50.920
And I never thought I would end up I'm an elite top 20

01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:54.600
school Duke University and Prebatec prepared me

01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:56.920
for all of those things and so much more.

01:43:57.400 --> 01:43:59.800
If the main reason why you don't support the reopening

01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:03.160
of the school is money then I respectfully ask you

01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:05.560
to reevaluate what you value in the school.

01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:09.080
Prebatec is lifting up our community and there are no

01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:09.960
schools like it.

01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:12.120
Our community needs Prebatec.

01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:13.640
Thank you very much for your time.

01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:15.560
Thank you caller.

01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:21.480
Hello caller please state your name and affiliation

01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:22.360
for the record.

01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:23.480
You have one minute.

01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:24.600
Your time begins now.

01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:32.600
Hello caller are you there.

01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:35.160
What number.

01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:38.760
Ending number is 3415.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:42.120
Hi good morning.

01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:44.040
My name is Sylvia Nicholson.

01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:47.000
I'm the office manager of Prebatec High School.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.880
I have the privilege to be working here at Prebatec

01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:50.840
High School.

01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:52.360
It's a great school.

01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:55.320
Prebatec High School prepared the students for the best

01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:56.360
education.

01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:58.360
Our community needs this school.

01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:01.880
We have an IB program that no other school has.

01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:05.320
Prebatec IB programs matter in this community.

01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:09.800
Our students and family are very happy at Prebatec High School.

01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:13.640
We work hard to receive the diploma program started

01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:15.400
for our students at Prebatec.

01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:18.200
Please give us the renewal.

01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:21.320
Our community really needs this school to stay open

01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:23.160
for another five years.

01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:27.160
It would be a great loss if this school is not renewed.

01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:30.440
Please let us continue to give the great education

01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:31.880
to our children.

01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:33.080
Thank you for your time.

01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:34.600
Thank you caller.

01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:39.640
Hello caller please state your name and affiliation

01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:40.520
for the record.

01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:41.640
You have one minute.

01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:42.840
Your time begins now.

01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:48.920
Hello good morning.

01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:50.520
My name is Gabrielle Kurtz.

01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:53.160
I'm a senior at Prebatec Los Angeles High School.

01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:56.200
I would like to request that Prebatec stay open

01:45:56.200 --> 01:45:57.960
simply because of the opportunities

01:45:57.960 --> 01:45:59.440
that are available to us there.

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:02.800
The IB program that is not offered at any other school

01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:05.840
near me and many others has taught me many skills

01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:09.080
and advanced my learning enough so that I feel confident

01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:11.120
in my journey to higher level education.

01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:14.400
Even though this course is rigorous my teachers

01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:17.320
have been able to support me and many of my peers

01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:18.320
in their struggles.

01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:21.440
After my four years of attending Prebatec

01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:23.360
I can confidently say that I have never met

01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:25.200
my dedicated and caring teachers.

01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:28.160
They've gone above and beyond for their students

01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:29.760
even during this pandemic.

01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:31.680
I'm now going to a four-year university

01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:34.720
in which most of my tuition is covered by scholarships.

01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:36.800
This is thanks to the opportunities available

01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:37.520
at my high school.

01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:39.760
I will be forever grateful for this.

01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:41.280
Thank you for your time.

01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:42.720
Thank you caller.

01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:45.440
Hello caller please state your name and affiliation

01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:46.400
for the record.

01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:47.680
You have one minute.

01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:48.880
Your time begins now.

01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:55.840
Hello are you speaking to the phone number 7619.

01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:57.120
We are caller.

01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:01.520
I'm not guarding yet but I think this would go a lot smoother

01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:04.160
if you just said the last four digits of each number.

01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:06.960
Caller your time is already ticking

01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:08.640
so please begin your message.

01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:10.720
Well one of the core values is that you have to be

01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:16.400
communication and many of my students brought up sentiments

01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:18.720
that the translator was misrepresenting significant

01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:21.200
messages from our Spanish speaking population.

01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:22.800
I thought that should be communicated.

01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:25.120
I'm starting now with my main point.

01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:28.880
I'm the mock teacher for the IB program.

01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:30.960
Caller you have 44 seconds remaining.

01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:37.840
Which is severely limited in scope unimaginative

01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:40.560
and neglecting a great deal of extremely important skills

01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:44.480
not offered in the course I teach for mathematics.

01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:46.240
If you disband this charter you're leading the future

01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:49.200
generation on a on a bleak and dismal path towards darkness.

01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:51.920
I'm a data scientist with five years experience

01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:54.240
in the aerospace industry and a software developer.

01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:58.080
I'm aware of the skills L.A. USC has done a terrible job

01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:00.160
of placing into the high school curriculum.

01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:02.000
Programming is non-existent.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.680
Nobody does any data research.

01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:07.040
My math students chose investigative topics

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:11.200
independently and they created 12 to 20 pages reports

01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:14.720
incorporating actual data collection analysis

01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:17.600
of their results and they made their own inferences

01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:21.600
and conclusions about many topics including coronavirus

01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:24.640
deforestation crime rates in L.A.

01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:27.600
So how many high school students are you testing

01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:30.320
on their ability to creatively apply mathematics

01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:32.560
and interpret the complex variations

01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:34.720
inherent in real world data.

01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:35.760
That's my question for you.

01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:41.040
Thank you.

01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:41.840
Thank you caller.

01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:48.720
Hello caller please state your name and affiliation

01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:49.600
for the record.

01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:50.720
You have one minute.

01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:51.920
Your time begins now.

01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:02.080
Caller ending with seven three four nine.

01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:02.960
Are you on the line.

01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:05.200
Yes.

01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:05.600
Hi.

01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:06.160
Hi.

01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:06.720
Good morning.

01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:11.280
My name is Jose Mendoza and I'm a math teacher

01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:12.880
at Prevotek High School.

01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:15.200
I'm calling in to voice my support in keeping

01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:17.440
the school open because of one major aspect

01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:20.880
and that is our school promotes growth.

01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:23.040
In the two years that I have been working at the school

01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:26.800
I have seen growth in all areas for my students teachers

01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:28.400
administrators and myself.

01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:31.840
The school actively promotes growth in several different ways

01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:34.560
but some of them include the IB curriculum

01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:37.920
having high expectations to both students and staff

01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:40.400
and most importantly provides the resources tools

01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:43.280
and support needed to advance the individual

01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:45.600
and learner to that higher level.

01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:48.400
The school is on a course for greatness

01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:52.000
and by closing it down now will be a disservice

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:52.880
to our community.

01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:56.400
Please vote to keep Prevotek High School open.

01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:56.800
Thank you.

01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:01.120
Thank you.

Good morning board member.

01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:00.160
My name is Karina Gongora.

01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:03.040
I am a special education teacher at Prevotek Los Angeles

01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:03.840
High School.

01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:07.600
I am also a proud team member and in support of the renewal

01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:10.080
of Prevotek Los Angeles High School for a few reasons.

01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:13.440
One Prevotek Los Angeles High School teachers are leaders

01:52:13.440 --> 01:52:16.640
who are making a positive and transformative impact

01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:18.720
in the lives of our students in this community.

01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:21.200
Prevotek Los Angeles High School is unique

01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:24.000
in that it offers students in the southeast community

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.960
an opportunity to experience academic learning

01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:30.640
and personal growth as well as global social responsibility

01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:31.760
through the IB program.

01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:36.320
The IB program acknowledges the changing histories of students.

01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:38.880
Barriers to learning and assessments are not restricted

01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:41.200
to those with a statement of needs.

01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:42.800
Inclusion is important.

01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:45.840
And inclusion is facilitated in the culture of collaboration

01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:48.320
mutual respect support and problem solving

01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:50.320
involving our whole school community.

01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:52.160
As a special education teacher I'm proud to say

01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:54.800
that the majority of our senior class students are enrolled

01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:57.120
in community colleges or in the process of attending

01:52:57.120 --> 01:52:58.160
a trade school.

01:52:58.160 --> 01:53:00.800
Students are participating in job readiness programs.

01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:01.760
Your time is up.

01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:02.160
Thank you.

01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:04.240
Thank you so much for your time.

01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:09.520
Hello caller please state your name and affiliation

01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:10.480
for the record.

01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:11.680
You have one minute.

01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:12.960
Your time begins now.

01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:21.280
Am I on.

01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:24.640
Caller ending in three eight nine five.

01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:25.440
It is your turn.

01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:27.280
Thank you.

01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:30.400
My name is Uriel Quiñones and I teach theory of knowledge.

01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:33.840
Board members are at promise students are now at risk

01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:35.280
of losing their school.

01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:37.520
While other states argue about the policies

01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:41.200
whether to include critical race theory and school curriculum

01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:44.160
IB schools such as Prepa Tech High School offer courses

01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:46.800
such as theory of knowledge which provide the opportunity

01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:50.160
for students to reflect on the nature of knowledge itself.

01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:51.760
These are our future leaders.

01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:54.720
The resilience of our students and faculty coupled

01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:57.680
with our high college acceptance graduation rates

01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:00.000
should overshadow the physical numbers that have already

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:00.960
been addressed.

01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:03.680
We're not asking for a bailout we're asking for renewal

01:54:03.680 --> 01:54:04.640
of a school.

01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:07.600
I ask this highly educated board to remember your training

01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:09.760
your schooling your pedagogy.

01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:11.520
At the end of the day we should be listening

01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:13.120
to our students and community.

01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:16.160
Do not let our students be forced to attend California

01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:19.360
public schools that have gone from first to worst.

01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:22.880
All students deserve equal access to high quality education.

01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:25.120
We are providing that for our students.

01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:26.480
Look at our grad rates.

01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:28.240
Look at our college acceptance rates.

01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:31.760
But most importantly look at the community we are building.

01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:38.960
A point of clarification for callers who want to make

01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:43.760
public comment we are able to see if somebody is calling

01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:45.760
in multiple times from the same number.

01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:49.440
It is our policy that each caller has one minute

01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:52.080
for public comment and we ask that you respect that.

01:54:55.840 --> 01:54:58.560
Caller please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:00.560
Excuse me for a minute.

01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:04.480
Let's have our Spanish translator repeat those

01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:08.240
instructions about calling in only once and that we can see

01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:08.880
the number.

01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:20.880
That's important.

01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:24.000
Gracias.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:25.680
Okay go ahead Carolyn.

01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:26.080
Thank you.

01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:30.400
Caller please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:31.520
You have one minute.

01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:34.880
Your time begins now.

01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:41.840
Caller 2532 it is your turn.

01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:45.040
Good afternoon.

01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:48.880
My name is Isabel Contreras and the reason that I am calling

01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:51.840
this is to support Prepatec High School.

01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:55.600
I've been listening to all the comments that I have been making

01:55:55.600 --> 01:56:00.080
and I know that LAUSD does have schools to offer our families

01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:03.680
but unfortunately our families want an IB school.

01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:07.040
An IB school that has been open in our community for once

01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:11.440
and is giving our kids an opportunity to success

01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:12.480
to a great future.

01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:17.200
We want the students to understand that being prepared

01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:18.880
for life matters.

01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:21.840
It's not just what you are being taught through books.

01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:25.840
As a community member for so many years within Wano Park,

01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:29.040
Cunningham Park and Bell I can tell you we've been waiting

01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:32.640
for so many years for a great school and now that we have

01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:36.160
this school that is a startup school has only been around

01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:37.520
for a couple of years.

01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:38.560
You want to take it away?

01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:41.280
Why not support a school for once?

01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:44.000
Why not be behind the school and make it better?

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.720
This is making a change in our community for once.

01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:47.520
Thank you caller.

01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:48.400
Your time is up.

01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:52.400

Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:56.000

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:57.120
Your time begins now.

01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:05.200
Caller ending in 2963.

01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:06.080
This is your turn.

01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:08.080
Hi.

01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:08.640
Good morning.

01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:10.880
I am Angelica Limon and I'm a parent educator

01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:12.000
for Perpatec Middle School.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.400
I'm calling on behalf of the Perpatec High School.

01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:19.040
I truly, I'm sorry, I truly believe that high school

01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:20.560
is in there in our community.

01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:23.760
Perpatec High School is the only IB school in our region.

01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:26.400
Our students deserve a school with an IB program.

01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:30.720
This is a good opportunity for them and it will be better

01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:34.320
to prepare them for an after high school education.

01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:36.880
I ask you please consider that Perpatec High School

01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:38.160
is known for a better future.

01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:39.040
Thank you for your time.

01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:40.560
Thank you caller.

01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:43.920
Hello caller.

01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:46.400
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:47.440
You have one minute.

01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:48.560
Your time begins now.

01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:53.440
Hello.

01:57:53.440 --> 01:57:54.000
Can you hear me?

01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:55.520
We can hear you caller.

01:57:55.520 --> 01:57:55.920
Thank you.

01:57:59.040 --> 01:57:59.360
Hi.

01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:01.520
My name is Alexis Sanchez and I am an 11th grader

01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:02.720
at Perpatec High School.

01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:05.440
I'm speaking today to ask for the renewal of my school.

01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:07.440
I have been a part of all the public schools

01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:09.120
since I was five years old.

01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:10.880
Attending since kinder, the school has changed

01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:12.080
my life for the better.

01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:14.560
I have been offered numerous amount of opportunities

01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:16.000
that no other school could provide for me.

01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:18.480
I have been given so much support from the teachers

01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:20.000
that I am beyond grateful for.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.880
At Perpatec, I feel happy and genuinely cared for.

01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:25.360
I know all my teachers have my best interest at heart.

01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:27.440
I have learned so many things because of Prepa.

01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:29.680
The learning environment motivates me to become better

01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:31.120
and grow each and every day.

01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:33.680
I am currently enrolled in the IBDP program.

01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:35.520
This program is a two-year course that will provide

01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:37.280
so many benefits for my future.

01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:39.520
If the renewal to my school is not granted,

01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:42.080
many of us will not be able to finish our DP course

01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:43.520
since it is a two-year course throughout

01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:44.480
junior and senior year.

01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:47.440
Please give the renewal to Perpatec High School.

01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:49.360
There's people against our renewal but they have no idea

01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:50.640
how it would affect us.

01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:52.160
They have not seen the help and assistance

01:58:52.160 --> 01:58:53.600
that Perpatec provides for us.

01:58:53.600 --> 01:58:56.240
They have not seen the doors that Perpatec has opened for us.

01:58:56.240 --> 01:58:58.080
Our community wouldn't be the same without it.

01:58:58.080 --> 01:58:59.840
I ask from the bottom of my heart that you approve

01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:01.440
the renewal of Perpatec High School.

01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:04.880
I can't thank you enough for all my life shutting down.

01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:05.360
Thank you for.

01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:08.080
Hello, caller.

01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:10.480
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:11.600
You have one minute.

01:59:11.600 --> 01:59:12.720
Your time begins now.

01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:22.800
Caller ending in 9314.

01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:23.680
This is your turn.

01:59:29.840 --> 01:59:33.200
Hello, caller.

01:59:33.200 --> 01:59:35.680
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:36.720
You have one minute.

01:59:36.720 --> 01:59:37.920
Your time begins now.

01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:45.360
My name is Ines Santana and I am here today to ask you

01:59:45.360 --> 01:59:47.360
to please renew Perpatec High School.

01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:49.760
Perpatec High School's early investments have paid off

01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:51.600
and it clearly shows in the acceptance of students

01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:53.440
now attend great universities.

01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:55.360
My children and the community deserve a better opportunity

01:59:55.360 --> 01:59:57.040
and Perpatec High School is here to provide that

01:59:57.040 --> 01:59:59.520
with the international baccalaureate program.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.240
Earlier a gentleman from LAUSD board shared that they have

02:00:02.240 --> 02:00:04.960
an extensive plan to find schools for the families

02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:06.480
and emphasize the IB program.

02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:08.240
This is a much easier step than done.

02:00:08.240 --> 02:00:10.960
It will be very hard for our families to travel to Hawthorne,

02:00:10.960 --> 02:00:14.080
Asianta Heights and Granada Hills where there are the other

02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:15.520
IB programs exist.

02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:17.920
I have two children and there is no way I would be able

02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:18.720
to make that commute.

02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:21.920
There is a school in downtown LA and it is a magnet school.

02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:24.400
And you and I know that it is very difficult to enter

02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:25.440
a magnet school.

02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:28.480
And for the record the majority of IB families that I know

02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:30.800
are here today because they were not able to get into

02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:33.040
an IB into a magnet program.

02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:35.040
Please renew Perpatec High School.

02:00:35.040 --> 02:00:36.400
Our kids deserve the best.

02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:37.280
Thank you for your time.

02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:38.720
Thank you caller.

02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:43.360
Hello caller please state your name and affiliation

02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:44.080

02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:46.480
Your time begins now.

02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:56.720

02:00:56.720 --> 02:00:57.600

Hello caller please state your name and affiliation

02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:12.640
for the record.

02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:13.760
You have one minute.

02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:14.960
Your time begins now.

02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:20.320
Hi.

02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:21.600
Good morning board members.

02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:24.800
My name is Lupe Mendez employee of Alta Public School

02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:26.480
since 2009.

02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:29.840
I am here to support and ask that Perpatec be renewed.

02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:33.840
Aside from providing a rigorous IB program we provide a safe

02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:35.920
and family oriented environment.

02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:39.600
A place where the students feel welcomed loved supported

02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:40.480
and safe.

02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:43.040
We have built great relationships with our students

02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:44.560
parents and community.

02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:47.600
Throughout my years with Alta it has been a blessing to see

02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:49.760
the growth in our students in all areas.

02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:54.880
As a former LEUSD student quite some time ago I wish I would

02:01:54.880 --> 02:01:57.520
have had the experience that our students currently have

02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:00.720
at Perpatec High and our sister schools.

02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:02.240
Hard work pays off.

02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:05.280
Along with our parents we are extremely proud of all

02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:08.160
of our students and graduating students that were accepted

02:02:08.160 --> 02:02:09.760
to prestigious universities.

02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:13.360
If that doesn't demonstrate the dedication of teachers

02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:16.960
leaders administrators staff students and parents

02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:18.400
then I am at a loss of words.

02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:22.240
Without the renewal this would be detrimental to our students.

02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:24.160
Thank you Paola your time is up.

02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:30.240
Hello caller please state your name and affiliation

02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:31.040
for the record.

02:02:31.040 --> 02:02:32.160
You have one minute.

02:02:32.160 --> 02:02:33.360
Your time begins now.

02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:39.680
Hi my name is Gilbert Hernandez and I am currently

02:02:39.680 --> 02:02:40.960
a junior at Perpatec.

02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:44.240
I have been with with the Alta family since its sister

02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:47.120
school Alguerame Moderna first opened in 2009.

02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:49.920
The school offers a unique IB education that teaches

02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:52.000
students to seek more in their education.

02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:55.600
I strongly urge you to renew Perpatec as we encourage

02:02:55.600 --> 02:02:58.160
the students to become not only better learners

02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:00.320
in the classroom but also outside of the classroom

02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:02.080
to become better members of society.

02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:04.560
If you shut down the school you will be sending these kids

02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:09.600
into into a worse education and into probably delinquency

02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:12.480
and you and I both don't want that so please I urge

02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:14.240
you to please renew Perpatec High School.

02:03:14.240 --> 02:03:14.960
Thank you for your time.

02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:16.480

Your time is now.

02:04:50.480 --> 02:04:53.520
Hi I just wanted to say that the typical LA math course

02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:57.040
teaches things that students never use and they get turned

02:04:57.040 --> 02:05:02.160
off by it and the IB curriculum teaches them how to apply math

02:05:02.160 --> 02:05:05.520
to real world situations and I don't understand if you're

02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:09.440
going to get rid of this school what is the point of teaching

02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:13.760
like the regular LA USC curriculum which has rational roots

02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:18.080
of polynomials that no one ever uses and a lot of students

02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:23.360
across LA just to test math because they don't ever use it

02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:27.760
for anything but the math course in the IB program is called

02:05:27.760 --> 02:05:31.600
applications and interpretation and if you're testing students

02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:34.960
on things that don't matter well how are you comparing apples

02:05:34.960 --> 02:05:39.120
to oranges because what they learn here I've seen students

02:05:39.120 --> 02:05:41.760
do amazing things with math and solve problems that are

02:05:42.480 --> 02:05:43.520
relative to their life.

02:05:47.600 --> 02:05:48.400
Thank you caller.

02:05:53.680 --> 02:05:56.080
Hello caller please state your name and affiliation

02:05:56.080 --> 02:05:56.880
for the record.

02:05:56.880 --> 02:05:58.080
You have one minute.

02:05:58.080 --> 02:05:59.280
Your time begins now.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:05.760
Hello my name is Michelle Solorzano.

02:06:05.760 --> 02:06:08.560
I am a family teacher at Prebatec Los Angeles High School.

02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:11.280
This has been my school for the past five years and within

02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:14.160
these years I see firsthand the academic progress

02:06:14.160 --> 02:06:15.440
of the school and students.

02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:18.480
This year alone we have seniors accepted to Cal State

02:06:18.480 --> 02:06:21.360
UC's and even Duke University to name a few.

02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:23.360
What we are doing for our students is providing

02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:26.000
them with a world-class education and the academic

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.720
tools to be able to be accepted to these colleges

02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:31.200
and to be ready for the real world that awaits them.

02:06:31.200 --> 02:06:33.760
Our students will graduate as lifelong learners as well

02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:35.520
as men and women of character.

02:06:35.520 --> 02:06:37.920
To see the school close will be heartbreaking for our students

02:06:37.920 --> 02:06:39.120
staff and community.

02:06:39.120 --> 02:06:41.600
I highly recommend that you approve Prebatec Los Angeles

02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:42.880
High School for school renewal.

02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:43.280
Thank you.

02:06:44.720 --> 02:06:45.520
Thank you caller.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.320
That concludes our public comment for this item.

02:06:52.800 --> 02:06:58.000
So given there are no other public comments I hereby close

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:01.600
the public hearing at 1139 a.m.

02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:07.360
And I just want to thank all the callers who took the time

02:07:07.360 --> 02:07:11.520
to call in the staff, the parents, the community,

02:07:12.240 --> 02:07:15.440
students, everybody who was part of it.

02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:18.000
I think the board listened very closely and we are now

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
going to begin our board discussion.

02:07:20.640 --> 02:07:23.760
So first I'd like to ask our board liaison Sue Burr

02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:27.280
and Ting Sung if they would like to make some initial

02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:30.000
comments and then following that we'll turn to board

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:30.480
discussion.

02:07:30.480 --> 02:07:32.560
Remember board members if you use the raised hand

02:07:33.200 --> 02:07:34.560
I'll be sure to call on you.

02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:35.840
So thank you.

02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:37.200
Member Burr and Sung.

02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:40.240
Thank you Vice President Strau.

02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:45.760
Before I make my comments I think Stephanie Farland

02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:50.800
might have a clarification on something from the

02:07:53.920 --> 02:07:54.720
presentations.

02:07:56.960 --> 02:07:58.960
Oh I just thank you member Sung.

02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:06.640
I had heard and maybe I misunderstood but in the

02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:09.440
charter schools presentation when they talked about some

02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:11.280
of the struggles they had fiscally when they first

02:08:11.280 --> 02:08:15.120
started the school upon startup that they didn't have

02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:16.240
any startup funds.

02:08:17.520 --> 02:08:22.640
But we did they did receive a $575,000 implementation

02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:26.800
grant federal grant that our department manages.

02:08:27.440 --> 02:08:32.960
And so I just wanted to clarify that because I thought

02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:35.120
that's what he said like I said I might have misunderstood

02:08:35.120 --> 02:08:38.240
that I wanted to put that out there that that grant was

02:08:38.240 --> 02:08:41.040
available to them and they applied and got that in 2016.

02:08:41.600 --> 02:08:42.320
Thank you.

02:08:42.320 --> 02:08:43.120
Okay thank you.

02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:48.800
Yeah so yeah again echoing Vice President Strau's

02:08:48.800 --> 02:08:51.760
comments thank you to the public who testified

02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:53.600
especially the students and parents.

02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:59.760
It you know it's always is difficult in looking at these

02:09:00.320 --> 02:09:04.240
charter renewals and knowing that they will be impacting

02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:06.320
people's lives.

02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:13.200
So I hear you at the same time I have still have some

02:09:13.200 --> 02:09:13.840
concerns.

02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:20.240
This school has the issues regarding especially the

02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:24.000
fiscal issues have been consistent.

02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:29.200
But the responses and the level of response to those

02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:34.240
concerns have not been consistent in that they don't

02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:38.880
seem like they have been addressed very seriously until

02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:40.960
up until maybe even this point.

02:09:42.240 --> 02:09:48.560
When these appeals come to us the charter has three major

02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:51.600
stabs if you will at addressing concerns.

02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:59.520
And at the at the district level and then at the ACCS

02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:04.960
and then coming to here I do not did not hear of anything

02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:10.320
about any kind of austerity plan or any major mitigation

02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:17.360
to the to the financial issues up until this point today.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:21.440
And I will have some additional questions when we get

02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:25.600
to the question part but just wanted to put out there

02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:27.360
that I still have some concerns.

02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:32.480
Member Burr did you want to make some comments?

02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:36.320
Yeah I think my comments are largely along the lines of

02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:37.360
board member Sun.

02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:41.600
Let me again also say thank you to everyone who called in.

02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:45.920
It's clear that there's strong feelings in support of the

02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:48.880
school by especially by parents and students that we

02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:53.280
heard from but unfortunately I feel like our responsibility

02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:58.000
is to sort of twofold it's both for academic performance

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.800
and also financial integrity.

02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:05.520
And again just to reinforce what board member Sun said

02:11:06.720 --> 02:11:09.520
we have overseen this school meaning the state board of

02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:12.720
education for five years and for five years we have seen

02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:16.000
consistent problems with financial issues.

02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:21.680
Stephanie and Farland laid that out carefully and I don't I

02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:24.080
didn't feel confident in the presentation that was made

02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:27.120
that they actually have been addressed and I also have to

02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:32.160
say that in my deliberations about charters I am always

02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:37.760
influenced greatly by what our own advisory commission says

02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:41.840
and in the case of the advisory commission on this school

02:11:41.840 --> 02:11:46.000
they voted unanimously to deny the renewal and they

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:49.280
they considered it very carefully and as I think you all

02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:52.720
know the majority of people who are sit on the advisory

02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:55.920
commission are actually charter school operators or they're

02:11:56.640 --> 02:12:02.880
in oversight agency so I take with great consideration what

02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:07.360
the advisory commission says so I'm looking forward to hearing

02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:10.720
what other board members have but at this point I'm not

02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:12.240
inclined to renew this school.

02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:14.640
Thank you member Burr.

02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:17.520
I have a couple of questions that I'd like to start the

02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:22.320
conversation with and first this is to LA Unified to Dr.

02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:26.240
Perry and your team so Dr. Perry thanks for being with us

02:12:26.240 --> 02:12:29.520
yet it's been a while since we'd seen you before so the

02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:32.000
first question is and I know this because I live in the

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.880
Los Angeles area that LA Unified had generally made a

02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:38.400
commitment to not close charters during the pandemic

02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:42.640
and we heard that you at least say that you originally

02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:44.720
recommended conditional approval.

02:12:44.720 --> 02:12:48.560
We were curious why and where the board disagreed with that

02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:51.040
original recommendation how that evolved.

02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:58.880
The steps board vice president Strauss were as follows when

02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:02.880
our team analyzed the data in the months that we had to do

02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:09.680
it our staff internal recommendation was denied the

02:13:09.680 --> 02:13:13.600
pandemic then because now under 1505 we have a much longer

02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:18.640
time the pandemic raged on and when we began to talk with our

02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:23.360
leadership about that that was a feeling because ultimately

02:13:23.360 --> 02:13:26.320
it's our superintendent's recommendation we're staff and

02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:30.880
we provide our best work to him and then he then provides

02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:35.120
that recommendation to the board and it was that you know

02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:40.400
what we don't know what's about to happen you know let's call

02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:44.960
a halt on that however when it got to the board level there

02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:50.320
was considerable discussion and it really revolved around

02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:54.320
what board member Sun and board member Burr were just

02:13:54.320 --> 02:14:03.360
discussing plans that weren't plans you know no path forward

02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:08.160
and this is not a new school you know this organization has

02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:10.800
been you know you can say it's a new school because this is

02:14:10.800 --> 02:14:13.840
their new but the organization's been around a while

02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:20.880
and one would expect the ability to create a plan

02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:28.000
particularly a financial plan that was stronger we even had

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:32.320
discussions of the finances with the renewal of one of the

02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:37.280
other schools it was a very difficult renewal because we had

02:14:37.280 --> 02:14:40.960
to dig into the finances so I hope I answered your question the

02:14:40.960 --> 02:14:46.560
board looked at that they looked at schools in the area and how

02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:51.360
those schools were doing and ultimately made the decision that

02:14:52.640 --> 02:14:58.400
in the best interest of students and in the you know in adhering to

02:14:58.400 --> 02:15:05.520
the education code that it would be recommendation for denial and

02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:10.800
they voted and Ms. Farland shared what that vote was thank you I

02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:14.720
have another question for you before I ask a CD question so we

02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:18.640
heard a lot of commitment to the IB program and how parents

02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:22.000
valued it they drive for that program we certainly heard from

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.960
the staff and students certainly how students are prepared and

02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:29.200
and how they that's a unique opportunity so if the CD

02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:34.560
recommendation is upheld to close it how are you going to think

02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:40.640
about students and how they'd be supported in LAUSD to transition

02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:43.440
because we worry about continuity particularly now

02:15:43.920 --> 02:15:47.440
and we've heard that there's not as many IB programs so

02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:50.160
what is the I know your team has thought about this what is the

02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:54.480
plan if the school should close right I'll speak first and then

02:15:54.480 --> 02:16:00.240
turn to our director who has also been in contact and together

02:16:00.240 --> 02:16:05.040
I think we can give you a full picture first of all what our

02:16:05.040 --> 02:16:09.920
team does as I indicated before we have we have a lot of

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:14.880
experience with this not so much in denials but more in self

02:16:14.880 --> 02:16:18.000
closures we have a quite a few of those so we have a process

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:21.280
that we go through and the first one always has to be a

02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:25.760
transcript analysis we need to look at where those students are

02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:28.560
and what they need not only transcripts we need to look at

02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:31.760
IPs we've spoken with our division of special education

02:16:31.760 --> 02:16:37.600
who stands ready to pull the IP data and begin to look at that

02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:40.640
and decide where the appropriate placement for those students

02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:46.240
will be we have a number of types of programs that students

02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:51.360
will will be afforded an opportunity to go to Mr.

02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:57.440
Cole Gutierrez would you fill in for this thank you Dr.

02:16:57.440 --> 02:17:04.000
Perry and oh good morning to you all and more to vice president

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.960
Strauss thank you for asking that important question in

02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:11.520
addition to what Dr. Perry shared we've had already

02:17:11.520 --> 02:17:14.320
detailed conversations respectfully knowing that the

02:17:14.320 --> 02:17:18.160
state makes the final decision but in preparation with our

02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:22.880
colleagues in our local districts in this community as

02:17:22.880 --> 02:17:26.560
well as surrounding communities looking at several school

02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:30.400
options the process of contacting families with the

02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:34.960
support of CDE staff the transcript analysis that Dr.

02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:39.520
Perry mentioned looking at IB programs in the area

02:17:39.520 --> 02:17:43.440
there are high school IB programs in the area some of

02:17:43.440 --> 02:17:48.080
them are about six miles from the location we did hear of

02:17:48.080 --> 02:17:51.680
some parents driving from other areas to for this school

02:17:51.680 --> 02:17:57.840
there are others in in proximate areas it still may be a bit of a

02:17:57.840 --> 02:18:01.120
of a drive but there are more options than the ones that were

02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:06.560
cited in in Hacienda Heights and Granada Hills etc.

02:18:06.560 --> 02:18:12.400
In short board members staff's commitment is to have an

02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:16.640
individualized approach families will have their choices from

02:18:16.640 --> 02:18:19.840
district programs and and always we also share other

02:18:19.840 --> 02:18:22.880
programs in the area whether they're LA Unified authorized

02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:25.360
charter school programs so they have the full

02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:29.280
array of options available to them and we will then

02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:33.680
support them to see which best fit their child's needs again I

02:18:33.680 --> 02:18:38.960
reiterate never an easy decision we honor that we honor those voices

02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:42.560
but also seek to to support the appropriate

02:18:42.560 --> 02:18:45.280
following of the law and accountability wherever that's

02:18:45.280 --> 02:18:47.760
being necessary so you can count on our commitment

02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:53.440
to provide that individualized service and to help families make their choices.

02:18:53.440 --> 02:18:57.040
Thank you my last question before I turn it to other board members

02:18:57.040 --> 02:19:00.160
this is to Stephanie Farland from CD and then I'm going to be asking

02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:04.240
Prepatech to respond to the English language development program it's been

02:19:04.240 --> 02:19:07.440
really important in California to look at integrated

02:19:07.440 --> 02:19:11.040
and designated support for English learners I believe this

02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:14.160
school serves a large English learner population

02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:17.760
we've continued to evaluate that in our review

02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:22.880
of charters first Stephanie I believe and I'd like you to review that that the

02:19:22.880 --> 02:19:25.840
CD did not find the English language development

02:19:25.840 --> 02:19:29.040
program adequate to meet the needs and then I'd like

02:19:29.040 --> 02:19:33.120
Prepatech to respond on what the actual program is

02:19:33.120 --> 02:19:37.680
so please Stephanie if you can address that that'd be helpful.

02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:43.680
Yes thank you so what we found was they do have an intervention program

02:19:43.680 --> 02:19:49.040
and their intervention program from all accounts seems to be adequate

02:19:49.040 --> 02:19:52.960
what they don't have is they don't have a curriculum

02:19:52.960 --> 02:19:57.200
and if I remember correctly and I wasn't here at the time so I think this is

02:19:57.200 --> 02:20:02.480
correct but when they were approved last go around by the state board that

02:20:02.480 --> 02:20:04.800
was one of the things that they needed to

02:20:04.800 --> 02:20:10.160
correct and and they haven't and so I'm not sure

02:20:10.160 --> 02:20:16.320
why they haven't done that yet and and I think there may I don't know

02:20:16.320 --> 02:20:20.080
there's some confusion around whether the intervention program is

02:20:20.080 --> 02:20:24.720
the curriculum but program but according to our special

02:20:24.720 --> 02:20:27.760
ed division staff who reviewed this they they do

02:20:27.760 --> 02:20:33.680
not have a standards aligned curriculum for their school and I'm sure they can

02:20:33.680 --> 02:20:38.400
they can talk about what their program is or does but that's what we have found

02:20:38.400 --> 02:20:41.360
is that they do have an intervention program

02:20:41.360 --> 02:20:47.760
they but we're not sure if it's standard standards

02:20:47.760 --> 02:20:51.200
aligned because they don't have an actual curriculum that standards align

02:20:51.200 --> 02:20:54.400
to put school thank you Stephanie so I appreciate the

02:20:54.400 --> 02:20:57.040
explanation so I'll ask prepatech and I'm not sure

02:20:57.040 --> 02:20:59.520
which I know we have several representatives from prepatech

02:20:59.520 --> 02:21:04.080
about what the English language development program is for all students

02:21:04.080 --> 02:21:06.480
and if you want to expand and explain the

02:21:06.480 --> 02:21:09.440
intervention it's a critical issue for us particularly

02:21:09.440 --> 02:21:12.960
in student support that have English learner needs so

02:21:12.960 --> 02:21:16.160
we'd appreciate if somebody from prepatech would be willing

02:21:16.160 --> 02:21:19.760
to address that I don't know if Mr. Aguirre are you the one that's going to

02:21:19.760 --> 02:21:24.160
address it I can address it and this via logos

02:21:24.160 --> 02:21:28.720
can chime in one of the things that is clear with

02:21:28.720 --> 02:21:35.440
our ivy program the the the premise of ivy is

02:21:35.440 --> 02:21:39.680
international and so they offer one of the two the

02:21:39.680 --> 02:21:44.240
things that is part of the ivy program is the dual

02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:48.080
language meaning developing our students with a

02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:51.600
primary language which is in many cases English

02:21:51.600 --> 02:21:55.280
but in other cases for English learners it is Spanish that's their primary

02:21:55.280 --> 02:21:58.400
language developing that language at the same time

02:21:58.400 --> 02:22:01.840
they're developing the other language the language what they

02:22:01.840 --> 02:22:08.000
call in ivy world the language B and so the language B

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:11.520
would be their secondary language and that's how

02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:15.360
we structured our program we use read 180

02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:21.680
as a tool for our students to be able to

02:22:21.680 --> 02:22:27.760
use a technology current technology for their acquisition of the English

02:22:27.760 --> 02:22:33.360
language they one of the things that

02:22:33.360 --> 02:22:39.760
is is embedded within the ivy is where their units as they develop the

02:22:39.760 --> 02:22:43.360
units there are the EL standards that need

02:22:43.360 --> 02:22:48.000
to be addressed and teachers indicate that in their unit

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:52.160
development you manage that where teachers enter create their

02:22:52.160 --> 02:22:55.200
unit and within that they have their content

02:22:55.200 --> 02:22:59.120
standards as well as the ELD standards that they are to address within the

02:22:59.120 --> 02:23:03.680
students within their classes and so that is

02:23:03.680 --> 02:23:08.000
what's what we do within our students and so then the

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:12.560
other thing is they have the ELD path where the teachers work with the two of

02:23:12.560 --> 02:23:17.760
the read 180 and align that with the

02:23:17.760 --> 02:23:22.240
ELD standard in order to address the development of the language

02:23:22.240 --> 02:23:26.800
English language acquisition. Thank you for the explanation. Is

02:23:26.800 --> 02:23:30.800
Mavia Lobos going to also clarify I just want to make sure if she

02:23:30.800 --> 02:23:35.920
hi good evening thank you so much I'm unable to share my video so excuse me

02:23:35.920 --> 02:23:40.080
for that it says that the host is not allowing me at this time so I'm

02:23:40.080 --> 02:23:43.280
sorry but just to kind of further what

02:23:43.280 --> 02:23:48.160
Mr. Aguirre said is oh thank you so much thank you

02:23:48.160 --> 02:23:51.600
and just to reiterate what we stated is

02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:58.640
we do absolutely have recognized that at the beginning of the history for

02:23:58.640 --> 02:24:02.160
Puppetik High School that there was a little bit of an

02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:05.520
issue with that and so the first thing that we did when

02:24:05.520 --> 02:24:09.840
we came on board it's going to now be three years of new

02:24:09.840 --> 02:24:13.680
administration is we identified that administration

02:24:13.680 --> 02:24:17.760
first and foremost has to be part of the multi-lingual support division

02:24:17.760 --> 02:24:21.840
and we participate in the English language roadmap project for example

02:24:21.840 --> 02:24:24.800
to be able to strengthen our English learners

02:24:24.800 --> 02:24:28.640
program. The next step that we took is we also compared

02:24:28.720 --> 02:24:35.200
how IB standards and the spoken sequence of

02:24:35.200 --> 02:24:39.840
IB correlates with the California English Language

02:24:39.840 --> 02:24:44.160
Development Framework as well as the English language

02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:47.360
standards so once we were able to identify that

02:24:47.360 --> 02:24:54.160
then we made sure that the MTSS process came into effect to ensure

02:24:54.160 --> 02:24:58.720
that we had and we viewed both the designated ELD

02:24:58.720 --> 02:25:05.360
as well as the integrated ELD utilizing also the state's

02:25:05.360 --> 02:25:09.040
what is it called the state's

02:25:09.760 --> 02:25:16.160
I guess I think this is the ICEP for you know from the state which is the

02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:19.120
individual student assessment disability profile

02:25:19.120 --> 02:25:22.400
in the beginning of the discussions to know

02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:26.160
where we're placing our skills once they come into

02:25:26.160 --> 02:25:30.320
to prepatech history. Thanks so much for the clarification so I'm going to turn

02:25:30.320 --> 02:25:35.200
to other board members now for any clarifying questions

02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:42.000
for CDE for the for the LA Unified or for prepatech.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:48.800
Go ahead.

02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:54.000
So for CDE staff Stephanie you had mentioned that

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:58.720
in the latest proposal of financials that there was an additional 22

02:25:58.720 --> 02:26:03.200
students or something was that added for this year?

02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:10.960
Thank you member Sen. Well based on their analysis and all you know

02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:14.960
we obviously didn't have a lot of time to dig into this since we just got it

02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:20.240
this week but it did seem like in the March report

02:26:20.240 --> 02:26:26.960
prior to ACCS there were 334 students in the May report there were 356

02:26:26.960 --> 02:26:30.960
listed which is a difference of 22

02:26:31.680 --> 02:26:37.680
and so I I'm not sure where that difference came from if it was a

02:26:37.680 --> 02:26:41.280
typo if it I so I like I said there wasn't a

02:26:41.280 --> 02:26:44.720
lot of explanation along with the different the various

02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:49.440
changes so I don't know where it comes from.

02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:55.920
Right and so was that to then did that then translate to the actual

02:26:55.920 --> 02:26:59.920
budget for this year and the revise of this year's budget

02:26:59.920 --> 02:27:07.360
that there would be because there's it's yeah go ahead yeah and I'm and I'm not

02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:11.600
I'm not sure because they I mean what they're giving us is a new

02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:15.600
projected budget but they use the current numbers

02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:19.360
were just different so I like they don't they didn't

02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:22.720
so they didn't redo their whole as far as I know and

02:27:22.720 --> 02:27:26.400
I have my fiscal person on on the call if I'm

02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:33.200
mucking this up but I didn't see any reason why they would currently

02:27:33.280 --> 02:27:40.080
uh change the the numbers in current year so I could see if

02:27:40.080 --> 02:27:42.560
they were changing enrollment projections for

02:27:42.560 --> 02:27:46.880
future years for the next five years but in terms of the report that we

02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:51.440
received this week they actually had a difference in current year numbers

02:27:51.440 --> 02:27:55.280
um and I just and there would no explanation member sun as to

02:27:55.280 --> 02:28:02.800
why um why that was uh so there was uh

02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:06.480
so that would be a good question for them are my fiscal

02:28:06.480 --> 02:28:12.160
person um is saying that this there was no budget assumption for the may report

02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:15.120
most of the revenue remained the same so I'm really not sure why

02:28:15.120 --> 02:28:19.600
those numbers changed okay if it's enrollment but then

02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:23.200
increase but then the budget numbers didn't change for that year it's

02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:26.400
it's fine because it's hold harmless this year anyway

02:28:26.400 --> 02:28:30.800
so their their their um enroll numbers would not

02:28:30.800 --> 02:28:34.320
impact any of their um their ada because they're held

02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:39.040
held harmless this year so it's okay well I guess part of the issue just is

02:28:39.040 --> 02:28:43.200
is that the enrollment numbers never have been what they were supposed to be

02:28:43.200 --> 02:28:46.560
if you look at the at the initial petition that you all approved this

02:28:46.560 --> 02:28:49.840
board approved um before their enrollment numbers they

02:28:49.840 --> 02:28:56.400
were projecting over 600 students for for 2020-21 um so that's been part of

02:28:56.400 --> 02:28:59.520
the issue um over the last several years and it's

02:28:59.520 --> 02:29:03.360
been part of one of the concern letters that we sent earlier

02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:06.880
in their term was that they were not meeting their enrollment numbers

02:29:06.880 --> 02:29:14.480
okay thank you and then for la usd um uh mr perry talked about a

02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:20.320
individualized approach to the students and making sure they're placed

02:29:20.320 --> 02:29:23.440
and so i'm assuming that if some of these students

02:29:23.440 --> 02:29:28.800
are eligible for an id diploma and they're a year away or two years away

02:29:28.800 --> 02:29:31.600
that you would do the best you can to place them in a

02:29:31.600 --> 02:29:34.160
program where they can actually receive that

02:29:34.160 --> 02:29:39.840
the person absolutely okay thank you

02:29:41.280 --> 02:29:47.440
so i'm looking for other board member clarifications or comments

02:29:47.440 --> 02:29:59.520
so i don't see any hands raised so at this time um

02:29:59.520 --> 02:30:03.600
i'll see if somebody's ready to make a motion

02:30:07.280 --> 02:30:11.920
i would move to adopt the department's recommendation

02:30:11.920 --> 02:30:19.680
