WEBVTT

00:07.938 --> 00:13.281
We heard and or took action on the following cases.

00:13.841 --> 00:18.784
CPEEM versus the state and options for youth.

00:19.445 --> 00:29.450
Burbank versus education audits panel, audits appeal panel of the California Department of Ed, State Board of Education and State of California.

00:30.051 --> 00:33.333
So we're now ready to resume with item 10.

00:34.420 --> 00:42.706
which is an overview of our career and technical education programs.

00:42.766 --> 00:45.848
We've not had a comprehensive look at this in a while.

00:46.248 --> 00:48.149
There is an awful lot going on.

00:49.650 --> 00:52.712
And so we will begin with that.

00:52.752 --> 00:54.173
It's an information item.

00:54.814 --> 00:57.836
And so Donna Wyatt, are you going to lead this?

00:57.896 --> 00:59.877
Please come up and get us started.

01:09.440 --> 01:16.214
Good morning, Deputy Chief Price and we can't hear you.

01:16.254 --> 01:16.735
Speak up.

01:16.755 --> 01:16.795
No.

01:21.536 --> 01:22.336
Yeah, now we're on.

01:22.576 --> 01:22.877
Okay.

01:24.377 --> 01:27.298
Good morning, Deputy Chief Price, President Kirst, board members.

01:28.038 --> 01:28.999
My name is Donna Wyatt.

01:29.019 --> 01:32.400
I'm the Director of the Career and College Transition Division here at the CDE.

01:32.420 --> 01:41.944
I'm going to be joined in our presentation today by Vantan Quinlivan, our Executive Vice Chancellor of Workforce and Digital Futures with the Community College Chancellor's Office.

01:42.524 --> 01:44.144
And also you'll be hearing from our

01:45.945 --> 01:54.990
California Pathways Joint Advisory Committee members, state board member Ting Sun, and also our co-chair of the advisory committee, Pamela Haynes.

01:55.550 --> 01:56.691
And I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.

01:56.711 --> 01:58.552
This is the first time I'm in front of you guys.

01:58.612 --> 02:00.853
So, bear with me today.

02:00.873 --> 02:00.953
Okay.

02:04.555 --> 02:05.395
That's good to know.

02:05.535 --> 02:08.197
I'm not so sure after what I saw with Cindy yesterday, but...

02:15.450 --> 02:19.032
Okay, then I'll talk directly to you, Member Rucker.

02:23.874 --> 02:25.655
So, let's see.

02:25.795 --> 02:26.315
I'm sorry.

02:26.435 --> 02:37.380
Again, I'm... Do you want to make it a slideshow?

02:37.460 --> 02:38.041
Oh, yeah.

02:38.101 --> 02:38.521
There we go.

02:38.721 --> 02:39.001
Okay.

02:45.578 --> 02:53.580
Today, our presentation will be an update on both the K-12 Strong Workforce Program and the new Career Technical Education Incentive Grant.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.641
We're referring to it as CTIG-2.

02:56.661 --> 03:02.563
We'll also provide an overview of the work of the California Workforce Pathways Joint Advisory Committee.

03:03.143 --> 03:12.626
And then finally, we'll end our presentation today with an update on the new Perkins V or also known as the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century.

03:24.253 --> 03:33.120
Before we go into the updates on the new CTE programs, I wanted to give a little bit of information on CTE and what career technical education is.

03:34.041 --> 03:39.305
Career Tech Ed is a sequence of courses that build students' knowledge and skills in a given industry.

03:40.649 --> 03:53.419
While integrating and reinforcing academic skills, the development of literacy and computational skills, collaboration, critical thinking, and project-based learning have long been the hallmarks of high-quality CTE.

03:54.320 --> 03:57.142
High-quality CTE is also informed by industry.

03:57.703 --> 04:01.306
Our industry partners are essential to the support of our CTE programs.

04:01.886 --> 04:06.334
They provide information on emerging trends in both technology and labor market.

04:06.815 --> 04:13.668
They inform our CTE standards and our curriculum, as well as provide work-based learning experiences for our students and our teachers.

04:14.986 --> 04:21.948
Work-based learning has recently become synonymous with internship, but work-based learning does not start and end with internship.

04:22.808 --> 04:27.710
It's only through a series of experiences that our students prepare for worksite internships.

04:28.410 --> 04:38.753
Classroom guest speakers, real-world learning projects, worksite visits, and job shadows are all necessary to prepare our students for successful worksite internships.

04:39.953 --> 04:48.614
Industry credentials and certifications provide the proof to employers that students have met a certain level of skill and knowledge necessary for entry-level employment.

04:50.222 --> 05:01.489
Early college credit through articulation and dual enrollment courses provide our students with a vision for their future and instill in our students the confidence and the belief that college can be an option for them.

05:02.250 --> 05:11.176
It brings together CTE teachers across the K through 12 and community college systems in order to support students as they transition across those systems.

05:12.574 --> 05:16.516
We require our teachers to be credentialed as proof of professional preparation.

05:17.037 --> 05:21.760
And the importance of industry experience as part of that credential cannot be discounted.

05:22.380 --> 05:30.065
CTE teachers are required to not only know their CTE model curriculum standards, but how those standards are applied in the industry.

05:30.525 --> 05:36.729
And it's that industry experience that allows them to speak knowledgeably about industry to industry.

05:37.589 --> 05:51.403
It's that essential knowledge of industry and the fact that our CTE teachers come to the classroom with industry experience that allows them to develop the relationships with our industry partners for the benefit of our CTE students.

05:52.631 --> 06:04.383
Our latest enrollment data shows that close to a million students are currently enrolled in K-12 CTE programs and K-12 CTE enrollment has increased by almost 22% since 2012.

06:05.844 --> 06:14.593
This increase is due in part to the investment in CTE through the California Careers Pathway Trust and the CTE Incentive Grant.

06:17.671 --> 06:24.505
The CTE incentive grant, the first grant was a one-time investment across three years of $900 million.

06:27.102 --> 06:36.350
In 2018-19, the Budget Act legislators demonstrated their continued support for CTE through the approval of a new CTE incentive grant.

06:37.190 --> 06:41.634
CTIC II allocates $150 million in ongoing funds for CTE.

06:42.395 --> 06:52.583
This allocation of ongoing funds recognizes not only the importance of high quality CTE, but also the fact that CTE programs are expensive programs for our LEAs to operate.

06:53.533 --> 07:02.080
Michelle McIntosh, our administrator of our CTE leadership office, is leading the work of developing a timeline and application process for the rollout of CTIG 2.

07:02.841 --> 07:14.390
We currently expect applications to go out in early January and division staff will be doing presentations around the state at various CTE conferences, as well as we'll be conducting webinars around CTIG.

07:15.151 --> 07:23.795
We're also working very closely with our community college partners on the second part of the CTE funds, and that's the strong workforce.

07:23.875 --> 07:28.457
And at this point, I'm going to turn it over to Vaughn to talk to you about the K-12 strong workforce program.

07:32.465 --> 07:33.066
Thank you, Donna.

07:33.687 --> 07:46.845
President Kurz, Chief Deputy Price, members of the Board, I know that my Board of Governors, including the Vice President Pam Haynes, whom you'll meet shortly, as well as Chancellor Oakley, would like to

07:47.325 --> 08:03.757
extend their appreciation for our ability to continually work with your agency and your board in order to promote career technical education that is aligned with the needs of the workforce so that our students can stair-step into future economies.

08:05.217 --> 08:17.682
So, we look forward to administering the K-12 Strong Workforce Program, which is extending the strong workforce framework that was developed by the Strong Workforce Task Force that had been commissioned by the Board of Governors.

08:19.543 --> 08:21.204
At the community college level, there was

08:22.765 --> 08:37.519
$248 million distributed across regions of California in order to bring together conversation in coordination because there was a recognition that no one institution could solve all the skill gaps and the workforce issues alone.

08:37.899 --> 08:44.825
And it took the efforts and assets of a region to come together and really think through how do we successfully

08:45.846 --> 08:51.807
equip students with the skills and experience so that they could be successful in the workforce and land and be ready.

08:52.547 --> 09:12.891
And so with the K-12 Strong Workforce Program, this is extending that regional infrastructure to the K-12 partners in order to ensure that you have the ability to sustain many of the investments that had been seeded with, for example, the California Career Pathway Trust.

09:13.471 --> 09:24.764
So the Budget Act allows for $150 million in ongoing funds where the distribution of funds will be done at a regional level in competitive proposals.

09:25.845 --> 09:31.051
And the intent is that those proposals go out in ways that are aligned with the labor market need

09:31.491 --> 09:39.476
but also reflect a lot of the practices that the joint boards have been studying and believe are helpful to students.

09:39.496 --> 09:43.339
So, for example, early career exploration, work-based learning.

09:43.379 --> 09:51.044
These are examples of practices that help students understand the context of why their academic program is so important.

09:51.964 --> 10:04.931
In addition, there's a $14 million in funds where we're going to be putting out a technical assistance provider because, as you know, without the capacity in the field to really do this work, it's difficult to get the work done.

10:05.231 --> 10:15.697
So we look forward to working with the CDE in order to move this forward, and we look forward to many more other collaborations.

10:15.977 --> 10:16.257
Thank you.

10:22.099 --> 10:33.447
At this point, we didn't know if you would want to ask us questions around the two initiative funds or if we should continue with the presentation and I can turn it over to Member Sun and Member Haynes to talk to you about the advisory work.

10:34.487 --> 10:36.349
Yeah, are there questions on this?

10:37.069 --> 10:45.435
This is really a paradigm change, if you will, in terms of what CTE was like many years ago.

10:45.455 --> 10:48.097
And it really...

10:49.685 --> 10:55.068
We've made enormous progress in having regional workforce needs.

10:55.108 --> 11:00.050
There's a large program that the governor has put billions of dollars in for workforce investment.

11:00.711 --> 11:03.632
Workforce investment boards are regional agencies.

11:04.112 --> 11:06.934
The Bay Area has three areas within it.

11:08.334 --> 11:11.556
And so that is a very strong employer component.

11:12.372 --> 11:19.420
And then from the employer component, you get the idea of what the pathways are in that region that are really crucial.

11:20.482 --> 11:30.173
And then what we've been doing is linking the community college endpoint of the career pathway to the pathway begin point.

11:30.632 --> 11:31.913
in the K-12 system.

11:32.594 --> 11:47.908
So it flows from what the regional businesses need, which vary enormously across California, and then starts with the K-12 pathway, which is interlinked with credit and courses to the community college pathway.

11:48.829 --> 11:53.853
So this is really an important shift.

11:54.614 --> 11:55.955
It has a lot of promise.

11:57.384 --> 12:11.040
The history of these have been somewhat unsettling in that in the past, as soon as the money goes away, the collaboration among levels goes away.

12:11.160 --> 12:13.022
So there's not any

12:13.843 --> 12:19.991
tradition or really ways to keep the two sectors together.

12:20.171 --> 12:21.853
And I think that's the challenge.

12:21.913 --> 12:28.501
So maybe you could address, is this going to be, I've lived through tech prep in the Clinton administration.

12:28.941 --> 12:31.625
I lived through things in the Johnson administration.

12:32.005 --> 12:33.167
It all looked very good.

12:33.658 --> 12:40.663
Money went away, everybody went back to his respective corners and did their old thing.

12:40.783 --> 12:44.306
So what's your hope and how are you trying to overcome that?

12:45.206 --> 12:59.897
I think what we've seen in presentations that have been given to the Joint Advisory Committee is that those consortiums or those regional partnerships that were strong before, say, the CPT, remain strong through the CPT.

13:00.237 --> 13:02.779
For those that use the money to fund

13:03.439 --> 13:08.260
administrative positions or things like that, we are hearing that there is a struggle around that.

13:08.401 --> 13:11.982
But those partnerships that were strong before the funds remain strong.

13:12.102 --> 13:14.342
We heard from the Orange County Consortium.

13:14.862 --> 13:16.563
We heard from Tulare County.

13:16.923 --> 13:18.363
We also heard from Sacramento.

13:18.464 --> 13:25.826
So the advisory committee has heard from some very, very strong partnerships that were strong before and remain strong and continue strong.

13:27.186 --> 13:28.548
not based on the funding.

13:28.928 --> 13:41.721
So I think it's a mix across the state and I think that is our work to continue those consortiums with the strong workforce dollars and with the CTIG dollars because we do want to continue on with services for our students.

13:41.781 --> 13:43.603
We don't want to go back to 30-40 years of voc ed.

13:48.770 --> 13:53.054
There's no doubt that it's easier to work in a silo than in a collaborative effort.

13:54.335 --> 13:59.100
And so the governor has been smart in staying the course.

13:59.840 --> 14:06.326
The monies, especially the regional dollars, flow in order to incentivize the coordination and the collaboration.

14:06.747 --> 14:11.151
And so we need to stay the course in terms of that policy focus.

14:11.852 --> 14:12.752
We're beginning to see

14:13.853 --> 14:23.339
Colleges and their partners collaborate in ways and innovate in ways that we hadn't seen before as a result of thinking through region as an organizing unit.

14:23.719 --> 14:37.788
As a matter of fact, last week, thanks to Bill Allen and the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation, so really the employer entity that's aggregating about 600 to 900 employers together in the LA area,

14:38.788 --> 14:45.970
for every single industry sector, they sat with the community colleges, all 19 community college presidents.

14:46.330 --> 14:57.353
So this is regional scale deployment and laid out the case that cloud computing was such a shortage that it was important for the community colleges and the partners to step in.

14:57.853 --> 15:05.355
And so the announcement was made last week where the community colleges will now do degrees in cloud computing

15:05.755 --> 15:13.980
And all 19 have pledged to work with their K-12 partners to begin stair-stepping students into that industry-recognized credential.

15:15.001 --> 15:25.367
If you are interested in getting into anything digital, and then if you're interested in doing anything that personalizes digital, your data needs to go into the cloud.

15:25.407 --> 15:29.510
And that's why that skill set is so important from a regional economy.

15:29.970 --> 15:41.953
So I think keeping players together in an authentic way allows them to begin to have continued creativity regardless of where the pots of money are coming from.

15:44.533 --> 15:48.694
Yeah, there are other board member questions on this.

15:48.855 --> 15:49.775
I have another one then.

15:49.795 --> 15:55.136
I have two of them actually.

15:55.556 --> 15:58.957
So we spent a half a billion dollars on the Career Pathways Trust Program.

15:59.912 --> 16:04.894
That the Career Pathways Trust Program is linked conceptually to this program.

16:04.954 --> 16:09.076
It's essentially just what I outlined and what our presenters outlined.

16:09.896 --> 16:13.298
So that money is now in its last year, I think.

16:14.618 --> 16:14.918
Yeah.

16:15.178 --> 16:23.342
And so what I've heard is that the ones that had a strong base, yeah, they're fine.

16:23.922 --> 16:25.463
That was before the money came.

16:25.583 --> 16:25.843
Okay.

16:26.443 --> 16:28.784
Then there's some that are

16:30.432 --> 16:34.654
Making progress but need more than three years of money to pull it off.

16:34.794 --> 16:39.776
I mean, that's not a lot of years for this kind of complex thing.

16:40.877 --> 16:54.203
So how will this new money work into the Career Pathways Trust grantees we've made that are sort of in that group that, you know, with more years they could make it, but if you cut them at three years, they're going to die.

16:56.578 --> 17:10.682
Well, I think what we're trying to do is make sure that these two funding sources are complementary to one another, where CTIG will operate pretty much like the first one did, where the first CTIG was really about creating new CTE programs.

17:10.742 --> 17:13.523
Now what we're looking at is you've created those programs.

17:13.583 --> 17:22.206
Now let's improve and expand those programs, where the strong workforce is more of a project-based funding source that goes over 30 months, I think.

17:22.506 --> 17:22.806
Correct?

17:23.406 --> 17:25.188
Yes, and both sources have the same metrics.

17:25.328 --> 17:25.528
Right.

17:26.289 --> 17:26.709
Exactly.

17:27.309 --> 17:31.073
And those metrics also will align with the new metrics under Perkins as well.

17:31.293 --> 17:43.823
So, and that's been a lot of the work that staff have been doing is aligning those metrics and looking at metrics that are going to not just be data for data's sake, but will tell us how to improve our CTE programs.

17:46.025 --> 17:49.228
Do you have any report, my third question, on how

17:50.986 --> 17:57.592
I guess it's $950 million which has been put into the regional occupation centers and programs.

17:58.333 --> 18:06.981
How that has changed the regional occupation programs and centers, I go back to when we authorized those programs in the 1970s.

18:07.021 --> 18:09.003
This board used to approve them one by one.

18:09.523 --> 18:12.326
So they have been around a long time.

18:14.004 --> 18:17.605
And some of them got rather ossified out there.

18:18.325 --> 18:25.246
So I'm wondering, you know, it was an incentive grant, but it was not a competitive grant.

18:26.766 --> 18:29.067
So they had to pledge to do things.

18:29.087 --> 18:32.307
Do you have any report on how that's gone?

18:32.327 --> 18:41.509
Because there again, you're dealing with long-standing dug-in institutions that may be hard to maneuver into new things.

18:42.512 --> 18:44.513
Well, I have to admit to a bias.

18:44.653 --> 18:47.175
I am a product of the Regional Occupational Program.

18:47.275 --> 18:52.178
I started as a teacher in 1990 with Colton Redlands Yucaipa, ROP in Redlands, California.

18:52.638 --> 18:55.159
Also worked for Riverside County, so I have a bias.

18:56.160 --> 19:00.562
We did, through the transition to local control, we did lose some ROPs.

19:01.043 --> 19:07.947
But I think the strength of the Regional Occupational Programs is demonstrated by the fact that the districts, particularly around the joint powers,

19:08.647 --> 19:20.116
authority districts that are JPA ROPs that exist because districts choose to have them continue to exist to deliver their quality career technical education.

19:20.216 --> 19:25.560
I think that is key around those ROPs that did survive through local control.

19:26.060 --> 19:31.705
We started, I believe the numbers were 74 and now we have 52 regional occupational programs.

19:32.706 --> 19:42.754
under the strong workforce program, their match is a one-to-one and I think that's in recognition of the fact that ROPs have always had a regional approach to labor markets.

19:42.794 --> 19:46.718
So, you're not replicating programs within a region.

19:46.838 --> 19:56.806
So, I think they continue to be strong because they have the support of their districts and their districts want them and recognize their expertise around career technical education.

19:56.826 --> 19:59.849
Okay, board member.

20:02.153 --> 20:02.433
Rucker.

20:03.093 --> 20:04.894
Okay, so now I do have a question.

20:05.254 --> 20:17.536
Concerning the different types of funding that you've laid out in front of us and knowing that under the umbrella that is CTE, there are all these programs such as ROP that have been in existence for quite some time.

20:17.996 --> 20:28.598
In what ways has the funding changed the organization of the field so that a lot of the silos that Vaughn has already talked about that do exist

20:29.298 --> 20:52.664
while they're still going to be there because there's this need to continue to label CTE programs and the mounds of work that goes into supporting the infrastructure, in what ways though has the funding required the field to be more collaborative so that ROP programs and districts and even higher ed programs in the community colleges

20:53.064 --> 21:12.636
are being more collaborative in the seamless ways they do the workforce preparation for the students, so that the programs exist not to perpetuate the existence of the programs, but create seamless ways for students to move through those programs in the pathways or the preparation pathways that they've chosen.

21:13.905 --> 21:19.847
I think the fact that the legislation speaks to the need for high-demand, high-skill, high-wage programs.

21:20.388 --> 21:26.970
I think the fact that the legislation speaks to the creation of a pathway, not a standalone CTE course.

21:27.090 --> 21:38.355
And the fact that we're not talking just about CTE programs, but programs of study that integrate and reinforce those academics, include the work-based learning, student support services.

21:38.375 --> 21:40.016
I believe the legislation

21:40.916 --> 21:50.784
takes the idea of, as Vaughn said, operating in a silo or operating just a standalone CTE program to moving it to bridge those gaps across the systems.

21:51.344 --> 21:58.930
Also, with our labor market and our workforce development organizations, industry has always been a part of CTE, so that remains the same.

21:59.110 --> 22:06.596
But I think it's the requirements of these two funding sources and the prior funding sources that said you can't be a standalone CTE course.

22:06.616 --> 22:09.478
You have to build bridges and have a handoff for students.

22:10.333 --> 22:17.419
Okay, so the reason I'm asking that question is I haven't, I'm not seeing that actually happening yet.

22:17.579 --> 22:23.664
So, is it still in the building blocks or the foundational stages of figuring this out?

22:23.744 --> 22:28.528
Because the programs are going forward and students are showing up and enrolling in these programs.

22:28.948 --> 22:34.370
But the linkages among those programs, I'm not, I haven't seen those actually form yet.

22:34.390 --> 22:37.670
So I want to understand, again, how is the funding?

22:37.731 --> 22:44.913
I realize there's requirements in the funding to do it, but you can give lip service to that in your application and get the funding.

22:45.273 --> 22:53.415
Where is the accountability or the evaluation to see how this is happening and the level or quality of that collaboration?

22:53.908 --> 23:04.337
I think that's addressing one of the things that we want to look at in this new CTIG is we want to move away from an application that is a narrative and we want it to be an assessment of CTE programs.

23:04.837 --> 23:16.447
And I think also with the new Perkins authorization, there's a requirement with new Perkins that there be a two-year overall assessment or evaluative assessment of CTE programs as part of that local application.

23:16.827 --> 23:21.191
So I think it's a process that we have to do in changing the application process to say,

23:21.651 --> 23:31.533
No more narratives, as you said, paying lip service, but evaluate your programs, tell us where you need to improve, and then show us how you're going to use the funds to improve that.

23:31.953 --> 23:38.854
And I think it's also important to recognize, too, that during the recession, we lost a lot of CTE programs.

23:39.194 --> 23:47.276
And there has been, while we're developing these bridges and extending these programs, there's also been a build back that has had to happen as well.

23:48.156 --> 23:53.197
And you know what my last question is going to be because I ask you this question every time there's two or three people together.

23:53.577 --> 23:56.998
So we lost during the recession a lot of CTE programs.

23:57.478 --> 24:05.139
But just as a factor of the aging of our workforce, we're losing a lot of certificated CTE teachers.

24:06.159 --> 24:15.741
How can this funding or how can the work that's being done, not only with Perkins too, but with the work that's being done to broaden the field and to define this collaboration

24:16.261 --> 24:23.866
among these elements, what can be done to pay attention to what needs to be a development and build up of the workforce?

24:24.606 --> 24:32.411
So glad you asked me that because we are working with the Teaching Commission on a new study on CTE addressing the teacher shortage.

24:32.491 --> 24:39.656
So similar to the study that came out from on special education, we have just started working on a study on that.

24:39.716 --> 24:41.677
So we're going to address the CTE shortage.

24:42.137 --> 24:50.782
And the idea of the report is not going to be just a report on what's happening, but make some really solid recommendations on how we address the CTE shortage.

24:50.862 --> 24:55.445
How do we get industry folks into the classroom for our students?

24:55.605 --> 24:57.806
So we are addressing that with this study.

24:58.126 --> 25:05.531
Okay, so in doing the work with the commission, you're saying that the primary issue of the CTE shortage is a certification issue?

25:06.091 --> 25:07.072
I think that's part of it.

25:07.472 --> 25:21.983
I think part of it also is the fact that in those industry sectors where we have the most demand, information, communication, technologies, health science, it's difficult to get industry to come into the classroom because of teaching salaries.

25:22.223 --> 25:27.127
What about the fact about the government pension offset, something we can't do anything about in this room?

25:27.347 --> 25:27.567
Yes.

25:27.587 --> 25:31.070
But that can't be ignored because that's a principal obstacle as well.

25:31.230 --> 25:33.211
No, and we have been talking about that as well.

25:33.471 --> 25:33.712
Okay.

25:35.287 --> 25:35.627
Thank you.

25:35.867 --> 25:36.227
Thank you.

25:36.648 --> 25:40.329
Okay, well then maybe we're ready to move on to the board members.

25:40.509 --> 25:44.631
We formed a joint advisory board.

25:44.651 --> 25:48.033
Ting Sun will describe it for us.

25:48.193 --> 25:59.098
And Vice Chair Hayes from Community Colleges is welcome to see you here and your hard work with us together.

25:59.118 --> 25:59.959
Hi.

26:01.155 --> 26:01.775
Good morning.

26:02.055 --> 26:02.696
Good morning.

26:02.756 --> 26:06.017
So you guys look a little intimidating from this side.

26:06.257 --> 26:10.639
Reminds me I have to smile a little bit more when people present.

26:11.059 --> 26:20.123
So I'm really pleased to be presenting to you with my colleague Pamela Haynes from the Community College Board of Governors.

26:20.663 --> 26:23.944
So I want to talk a little bit about the Joint Advisory Committee.

26:29.529 --> 26:35.211
So I want to talk to you a little bit about the work of the Workforce Pathways Joint Advisory Committee.

26:35.811 --> 26:43.574
So first I want to point out that this advisory committee of the State Board of Education and the Community College Board of Governors is not new.

26:44.195 --> 26:46.236
It was actually established under Ed Code

26:47.336 --> 26:49.517
Gosh, I think in the 70s or something.

26:49.577 --> 26:52.219
I did a Google search and I saw something in the 70s.

26:52.699 --> 26:58.902
So, and the original idea was to aid in the support of planning and coordinating vocational education and training programs.

26:59.563 --> 27:00.583
I used to chair this.

27:00.924 --> 27:01.664
Oh, you did?

27:01.804 --> 27:05.906
In the 70s.

27:05.926 --> 27:13.951
So, its original charge was to review and comment on proposals, policies, procedures, and the allocation of funds to voc ed.

27:15.416 --> 27:21.563
In response to the changing times and current workforce needs, this new and improved

27:23.058 --> 27:31.343
advisory committee has embraced a mission that is broader than what was originally outlined in Ed Code.

27:31.904 --> 27:37.047
I see our work as more than promoting high quality CDE programs.

27:37.447 --> 27:48.314
In fact, what we are doing is shaping the preparation of youth to participate in an evolving and competitive world economy and to achieve to their highest potential.

27:48.994 --> 27:51.076
Consequently, you will hear from my colleague,

27:51.576 --> 27:58.706
Pamela Haynes, our guiding principles focus on the educational and employment equity access and attainment.

27:59.427 --> 28:05.315
In fact, the joint advisory committee has a role in both the CTE incentive grant as well as the K-12.

28:05.375 --> 28:07.297
This is where my next slide goes.

28:08.078 --> 28:11.940
as well as the K-12 Strong Workforce Program.

28:12.581 --> 28:25.488
Most recently, the 2018 Budget Act has charged the committee with making annual recommendations to the legislature and the Department of Finance on appropriate metrics to measure and evaluate applicants of both of these programs.

28:25.948 --> 28:35.396
So some of the questions, President Hirsh, that you brought up and Member Rucker, you had brought up around concerns, the partnerships, the coherence, cohesiveness.

28:35.556 --> 28:36.818
Is that going to continue?

28:37.138 --> 28:42.983
That is part of the work of this committee through our principles and through the establishment of these metrics.

28:44.918 --> 28:53.802
So the committee is made up of three state board members, Feliza Ortiz-Lacon and Patricia Rucker, who are my colleagues.

28:54.202 --> 29:03.106
And then on the board of governors, we have a new member, Joe Alinda Grande, Pamela Haynes, who serves as our vice chair, and Valerie Shaw.

29:03.526 --> 29:08.768
Prior to this, Joseph Belansky has worked with us over the last couple years.

29:09.068 --> 29:17.438
And we also have two ex-officio members, Gustavo Herrera from Young Invincibles and David Rathbree from the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce.

29:18.219 --> 29:25.708
We've met seven times now, and we hope to have two, well, we will have two more meetings before the end of this year.

29:25.929 --> 29:27.771
And so we'll have nine meetings.

29:28.852 --> 29:35.074
In that time, we have done a recognizance of the different kinds of CTE programs throughout the state.

29:35.414 --> 29:55.680
We've heard from various stakeholders at all different levels so that we can glean an idea of what is currently out there in the landscape of CTE programs in California, and then what we need to do to help support and bring the work forward, the high-quality work that they have been doing forward.

29:57.000 --> 30:05.823
So the guiding principles we have been working on and my colleague Pamela Haynes will be going through some of the details of those principles.

30:06.343 --> 30:07.624
So thank you for having us.

30:08.584 --> 30:15.967
The nuts and bolts of the work that we are doing or have done is really in formulating and developing the guiding principles.

30:16.567 --> 30:17.847
From December 2017 to May

30:20.169 --> 30:30.249
2018, the committee sensitized information that had been presented to create the guiding policy principles to support K-14 and pathways.

30:31.585 --> 30:34.227
and a document emerged out of that work.

30:34.707 --> 30:45.056
During these meetings, committee members also reviewed, discussed, and provided clarity on specific elements of what it needed to be within that document.

30:45.816 --> 30:53.563
During the March and May 2018 meetings, the committee approved the document and requested feedback from the public.

30:56.465 --> 31:05.776
The guiding principles are critical to the overarching values that we present through those principles.

31:06.316 --> 31:13.224
A focus on student-centered delivery of services, the promotion of equity and access,

31:14.125 --> 31:22.528
with the goal of achieving system alignment, that's really where the rubber hits the road relative to collaboration.

31:23.568 --> 31:30.250
If we cannot figure out how to share our data and align our systems, then we're not going to be successful.

31:30.611 --> 31:34.972
And it means that at some level, our students are not going to be successful as well.

31:37.153 --> 31:43.075
The guiding principles also include support for continuous improvement and capacity building.

31:43.895 --> 31:49.829
and to also ensure that the state priorities and the direction lead us to a state plan.

31:55.259 --> 32:05.544
It also needs to be, we've said this, but the clear elements of this is really student-centeredness.

32:06.264 --> 32:12.067
We say that, but we really, in every one of our decisions, we have to say those words.

32:12.307 --> 32:13.788
Is this in service to students?

32:14.868 --> 32:25.934
If we don't, if that falls behind, then we'll end up doing, in many cases, what we think is important, but may not be important on behalf of students.

32:26.975 --> 32:36.920
Equity, and we talked a lot about this, equity is a word, but it has to permeate every one of our values and every one of our principles.

32:37.440 --> 32:42.003
We cannot afford, in this day and age, to leave anyone behind.

32:42.863 --> 32:50.049
And given the demographics in this state, it's essential that we bring everyone along.

32:51.170 --> 33:00.278
We have to also ensure that we are building leadership at all levels and that there is high quality integrated curriculum and instruction.

33:00.718 --> 33:02.059
And I wanna pause here.

33:04.021 --> 33:08.284
We have to make certain that the curriculum and the instruction is relevant.

33:08.785 --> 33:09.705
We are living in,

33:10.746 --> 33:25.519
an economic time and an economy that is continually changing and therefore we cannot just create instruction and curriculum and just think that that's going to last us for five years or four years.

33:26.361 --> 33:28.263
It has to be ever evolving.

33:28.723 --> 33:41.133
And we have to make certain that we're listening to those folks that are creating those jobs in industries that are relevant to make certain that our curriculum matches their particular needs.

33:41.333 --> 33:48.739
And the industry is meeting a broader need, and that is the consumer need.

33:49.060 --> 33:51.241
And we are indeed a consumer economy.

33:52.865 --> 33:59.032
We also will need to have skilled instruction and educational leadership informed by professional learning.

33:59.933 --> 34:11.827
And I say this, and I want to also stop to say that if we are not making certain that those in the field are not getting the political

34:13.488 --> 34:26.240
development that they need in order to make certain that they are delivering for our students the high quality of instruction and curriculum, then we all feel.

34:26.280 --> 34:29.803
So all of these are working in tandem with each other.

34:35.538 --> 34:44.322
The essential elements of this high quality college and career pathway also will include career exploration and student supports.

34:46.323 --> 34:47.244
I have an aside.

34:47.704 --> 34:51.866
I have granddaughters in Los Angeles.

34:52.206 --> 34:57.249
My daughter is an LA Unified District school teacher.

34:57.729 --> 35:01.190
She's third generation teachers in LA Unified School District.

35:02.211 --> 35:04.112
My granddaughters go to LA Unified

35:04.472 --> 35:05.173
school district.

35:05.973 --> 35:20.406
And what I have seen, and I have families, what I have seen are in some cases students not getting that career exploration where they need it.

35:21.366 --> 35:27.632
And they come to us, rightly so, but they come to us with not a lot of knowledge about what it is they want to do.

35:28.192 --> 35:29.193
And we've got to change that.

35:29.233 --> 35:32.836
We both together need to change that piece of it.

35:33.436 --> 35:35.158
That exploration needs to happen.

35:35.578 --> 35:38.120
And it's not that they're going to make that decision.

35:38.180 --> 35:41.783
It's going to be the only decision they make relative to their education.

35:42.103 --> 35:44.105
But they need to know what's available out there.

35:44.145 --> 35:45.285
It needs to be relevant.

35:45.726 --> 35:49.629
They need to have a feeling about what that feels like.

35:50.049 --> 35:51.470
relative to the expiration.

35:51.550 --> 35:56.814
I have my granddaughters in middle school and so she's telling me of the pathways that she's learning.

35:56.834 --> 35:58.155
Now she doesn't call them pathways.

35:59.096 --> 36:04.039
She calls it a rotation every, I don't know, four or five weeks in something different.

36:04.800 --> 36:10.124
That's expiration for her and that's absolutely what's needed across both of our systems.

36:11.645 --> 36:15.728
There has to be also appropriate use of data and continuous improvement.

36:17.009 --> 36:18.370
Cross-system alignment.

36:20.513 --> 36:21.774
For me, that's critical.

36:21.834 --> 36:28.260
We cannot make good decisions unless we can align our systems and we use data in that decision-making process.

36:29.040 --> 36:30.602
Somebody mentioned collaboration.

36:30.662 --> 36:33.544
That's where collaboration has to happen.

36:33.925 --> 36:35.046
It has to happen in the field.

36:35.086 --> 36:46.896
These are wonderful principles, but unless we push this down, unless they are embraced in the field and incorporated in the workings of what folks do every day on our campuses,

36:47.376 --> 36:55.210
and within the K-12 system at the school level, then we're not going to be as successful as we should be.

36:56.512 --> 36:59.397
We also have to have intentional recruitment

37:00.562 --> 37:01.203
and marketing.

37:01.643 --> 37:04.066
That means promotion.

37:04.226 --> 37:05.167
It means outreach.

37:05.487 --> 37:06.588
It means communication.

37:06.968 --> 37:13.914
And it needs to be the communication that's relevant not just to some of the external folks.

37:14.255 --> 37:20.601
It needs to be relevant to our high school students and our middle school students.

37:21.742 --> 37:27.169
What they see, what they do, isn't how we gather information.

37:27.449 --> 37:31.454
We have to use their methods of communication, and we have to do it well.

37:31.734 --> 37:39.925
And we have to use their vocabulary and their language in order to communicate so that they understand all of the possibilities that are in front of them.

37:40.851 --> 37:46.562
And we have to also find sustained investments in funding through mutual agreements.

37:47.063 --> 37:48.426
We have to have partnerships.

37:48.847 --> 37:52.534
We have to have collaboration, or all of these principles are for naught.

37:57.225 --> 38:05.092
So the working norms for fostering a mutual, beneficial, intersegmental relationship, it's got to be frequent.

38:05.532 --> 38:06.493
It's got to be open.

38:07.134 --> 38:09.236
It's got to be intentional communication.

38:10.297 --> 38:12.699
And the openness is critical.

38:13.379 --> 38:17.263
We have to be willing to share not only our successes, but our awards.

38:19.478 --> 38:20.059
it doesn't work.

38:20.119 --> 38:25.201
And so that means building trust and it means breaking down barriers.

38:25.782 --> 38:28.363
And it also means frequency.

38:29.944 --> 38:35.507
It means that we talk to each other and we feel comfortable in doing that.

38:35.927 --> 38:47.933
And when I say talk, I mean every method of talking, email, webinars, whatever those communications are that we can continue our conversations and we can work together collaboratively.

38:48.673 --> 39:03.560
We also have to have, and I think this was somewhat mentioned, a mindset shift to coordinate and plan and to enter dependent and implementation of systems.

39:05.001 --> 39:12.050
This is, as someone said, a complete shift on how we have done and how we've worked in the past.

39:13.412 --> 39:22.283
So, roll up your sleeves, put on your boots, put on your skates, because that's what we're going to need.

39:22.924 --> 39:28.226
And we've got to leverage and build upon and or replicate effective models and practices.

39:29.167 --> 39:30.407
There are models out there.

39:30.688 --> 39:34.049
We got chance, we had an opportunity to see them working.

39:34.990 --> 39:37.611
I was extremely impressed on what I saw.

39:38.071 --> 39:40.432
We just now need, this is a big state.

39:40.472 --> 39:41.853
We got a lot of students.

39:42.273 --> 39:46.915
We now need to replicate that and do best practices across the state.

39:46.995 --> 39:51.057
I believe that if there's a will, as my daddy said, there's a way.

39:57.113 --> 39:58.414
And then finally, thank you.

39:58.774 --> 40:06.159
And then finally, we need to build a new culture for our institutions and incentivize behaviors and relationships.

40:06.880 --> 40:08.601
We do have to incentivize.

40:10.523 --> 40:12.864
And we'll have to figure out how we're going to do that.

40:15.891 --> 40:20.658
This is not just about money, but we really do have to repurpose our dollars.

40:20.698 --> 40:28.631
We will need to put dollars where they absolutely need to be, because we do need to incentivize different practices.

40:31.673 --> 40:36.757
And then the ongoing relationships through sustained funding and mutual agreements.

40:36.797 --> 40:38.018
I think I've already said that.

40:39.259 --> 40:46.544
And there needs to be, finally, a commitment to the work to create stability and sustainability.

40:47.245 --> 40:51.969
And I think as you build it, those are the two things that are part of the building blocks.

40:53.609 --> 40:55.510
We have to figure out how to sustain this.

40:55.730 --> 41:00.791
And so that means not just in good times, but it also means in preparation for the bad times.

41:01.131 --> 41:04.272
Because if we really do care about it, we need to figure out how to keep it.

41:04.732 --> 41:05.152
Thank you.

41:06.833 --> 41:21.357
So to close this section, so to also help maybe address President Kurtz's question about what happened to the $900 million investment that we've made in California, we have these shining lights of programs that have evolved.

41:22.397 --> 41:37.883
But also what has resulted from that is what I feel a new constitution through these principles about how the state should move forward collaboratively in developing stronger workforce pathways programs throughout the state.

41:38.303 --> 41:40.224
And so I encourage anyone

41:41.104 --> 41:47.005
to go to the website, provide any comments on our principles, take a look at that.

41:47.406 --> 41:50.046
I think that this is how we will move forward together.

41:50.946 --> 41:59.028
What's been wonderful about this committee is that we didn't just get together so that we can figure out how we split the money or how we're going to use money.

41:59.128 --> 42:01.829
It was not a transactional relationship.

42:01.929 --> 42:09.311
It was actually, it was building relationships actually through these principles so that we have a common understanding moving forward.

42:09.932 --> 42:15.603
And so with that, we're gonna close with how we are going to move forward from here.

42:15.623 --> 42:16.605
Donna.

42:24.833 --> 42:32.858
So before we move forward, I want to update you on the Strengthening Career and Technical Education Act in the 21st century.

42:33.458 --> 42:40.602
Our federal legislators surprised us with an authorization of this on July 31st, 2018 of this year.

42:41.082 --> 42:46.265
So we are referring to it as Perkins 5 because it's much easier to refer to it as Perkins 5.

42:48.106 --> 42:52.891
Perkins V funding is split between the community college and the CDE.

42:53.351 --> 42:55.854
Last year, the funding was $120 million.

42:56.314 --> 43:00.178
And the funding split that you see on the screen is mandated by the Act.

43:04.158 --> 43:14.668
New elements to Perkins 5, there is still a hold harmless clause, but it has been updated to 2017-18 levels, which is up from 1998 levels.

43:15.789 --> 43:23.315
Eligible agencies remain essentially the same, but they have expanded the definition of tribal agencies as eligible agencies.

43:24.416 --> 43:29.740
Special populations has been revised and also expanded to include children of active duty military.

43:30.220 --> 43:38.586
There's also an increase in funding for the recruitment of special populations into CTE as well as additional funding for our state institutions.

43:39.526 --> 43:45.792
The new act, this is very exciting and it speaks to what Member Haynes talked about, about the need for career exploration.

43:46.252 --> 43:49.155
The new act uses the definition of ESSA for middle grades.

43:49.535 --> 43:56.061
So that means Perkins will now be able to be used all the way down into fifth grade for career exploration and career guidance activities.

43:56.121 --> 43:59.104
So we're going to get the kids even younger, which is great.

44:00.405 --> 44:03.809
The new state plan will go from a six-year plan to a four-year plan.

44:06.010 --> 44:11.874
For the first time, Perkins V defines the definition or gives a definition for a concentrator.

44:12.334 --> 44:20.499
A secondary concentrator will be defined as a student who completes at least two CTE courses in a single CTE program or program of study.

44:21.060 --> 44:30.846
And then post-secondary will use the definition of a student who has earned at least 12 credits in a CTE program or has completed a program even if it's less than 12 units.

44:32.908 --> 44:46.167
Perkins V also is going to expand the reporting requirements around our core indicators to subgroup and subpopulations, as well as they're going to require us to identify gaps in performance.

44:47.569 --> 44:51.713
With this requirement they are increasing the amount of reserve that we can hold back.

44:51.934 --> 44:55.157
Currently under Perkins 4 it's a 10% reserve.

44:55.257 --> 45:10.072
Perkins 5 increases that to 15% so that we can use those funds to address those disparities or also fund those districts that have higher concentrations or higher numbers of CTE students or are rural districts that need a little bit more help.

45:11.533 --> 45:17.895
Perkins V, as I mentioned earlier, also requires a comprehensive assessment of CTE programs every two years.

45:18.955 --> 45:32.880
And then while the act has to be approved by the feds, we have a lot more autonomy around determining our performance levels as well as our core indicators.

45:34.320 --> 45:41.022
Currently, we're awaiting guidance from the Office of Career, Technical and Adult Education.

45:41.222 --> 45:47.984
They have been corresponding with us, but basically to say we understand you have lots of questions and we have guidance coming.

45:48.505 --> 45:57.907
We have a tentative timeline that shows that 19-20 will be a transition year to the new Perkins with the new act becoming effective on July 1st, 2020.

46:01.789 --> 46:10.311
Our view and the work as we move forward is to work basically under the same idea that our ESSA plan was put together.

46:10.711 --> 46:15.112
And that is that we want the California way to lead the work of Perkins.

46:15.272 --> 46:19.454
We want our state priorities to lead that work.

46:20.114 --> 46:24.695
And at this point, that concludes our presentation and I'm happy to take any questions.

46:25.856 --> 46:27.878
Remember questions, our team's at home.

46:30.159 --> 46:31.080
Still be nice now.

46:31.680 --> 46:33.782
Donna, you did an amazing job.

46:33.902 --> 46:34.883
Congratulations.

46:36.104 --> 46:36.684
Great job.

46:36.724 --> 46:42.689
And I sit on this committee and I just want to thank Vaughn and Pamela for joining us.

46:42.769 --> 46:45.371
And of course, team, you did a great job with the presentation.

46:45.391 --> 46:46.732
This has been

46:47.792 --> 46:58.219
a whole new way of looking at education because we get to work with our family members from community college and understand that we're so different, yet we share the same students.

46:58.639 --> 47:01.521
So there's been a lot of learning between the two systems.

47:01.981 --> 47:03.322
There's been a lot of

47:05.168 --> 47:14.575
let's see, sort of discovery of where we're not aligned and learning each other's language because we speak different languages, even though we're both in education.

47:15.155 --> 47:18.037
So I've really enjoyed this liaison assignment.

47:18.197 --> 47:20.499
We get to work on another state plan.

47:20.959 --> 47:22.200
That is amazing.

47:26.362 --> 47:29.804
And so I think that moving forward, we are having a meeting next week.

47:30.344 --> 47:41.768
It would just we have to continue this conversation and translating for each other because the California way in K-12 may be different than the California way in community college.

47:42.408 --> 47:44.389
if they even call it the California way, right?

47:45.450 --> 47:51.093
So it's going to be an interesting time going through the state plan for Perkins.

47:51.533 --> 47:53.695
And I just want to say that I look forward to it.

47:53.755 --> 47:58.617
I know we have a lot of conversations ahead, but this has been a very collaborative effort.

47:58.657 --> 48:09.764
And I've appreciated learning from the community college and understanding that we are one system at the end of the day, because we're essentially growing the students from K-12 and sharing them with community college.

48:10.004 --> 48:10.244
Thank you.

48:13.601 --> 48:14.782
Okay, Emma is next.

48:16.963 --> 48:18.344
Thank you for your presentation.

48:18.444 --> 48:29.771
I actually attend a career technical high school for health and bioscience, so I really enjoy this work because we have high schoolers graduating with medical assisting certificates, so I see the benefit.

48:30.351 --> 48:34.254
And you had mentioned something about an assessment and you also talked about equity.

48:34.694 --> 48:37.536
So, how are you able to measure equity in districts?

48:37.616 --> 48:45.840
Because what's happening in a lot of places is that the classrooms where the career technical education is happening is not reflecting the population.

48:46.320 --> 48:47.661
And so, how are you going to measure that?

48:47.741 --> 48:56.666
And another part of it is really addressing the difference of equality and equity, because a lot of people are confusing the two, which are very different.

48:56.706 --> 48:59.708
So, how are you able to, like, really clarify that to different communities?

49:01.008 --> 49:02.429
I need to be transparent.

49:02.589 --> 49:08.251
I worked in your district for eight years so I know those pathways that you're speaking of.

49:09.252 --> 49:16.094
I think our principles in the sense that our principles separate equity and access.

49:16.234 --> 49:19.916
I think one of the things that we need to do is to make sure that

49:20.896 --> 49:26.338
we understand that access doesn't just mean a statement of we're open to everybody.

49:26.838 --> 49:42.723
I think access means ensuring that our pathways are welcoming places for all of our students, that our students know that they are welcome in those pathways, that they can achieve in those pathways, that there is a place for them.

49:43.364 --> 49:47.445
I think with regards to equity, one of the things that

49:47.885 --> 49:56.516
I know occurred in Oakland Unified was we didn't always put first choice as most important for students.

49:57.117 --> 50:00.501
We looked at or Oakland looked at the idea that

50:03.174 --> 50:06.759
you wanted pathways to look like the school looked.

50:07.459 --> 50:16.671
And sometimes that meant saying to students, you're not going to get your first choice because it's more important that that pathway look like the school.

50:17.091 --> 50:19.234
So I think that's one thing that locals can do.

50:19.715 --> 50:20.095
I think

50:20.876 --> 50:36.005
It's one of the things that the advisory committee and the larger group that's going to put together the plan that we're going to have to look at, at putting really concrete principles around what do we mean and what does it actually look like on the ground to say equity.

50:36.025 --> 50:39.967
State Board Member Rucker next.

50:41.025 --> 50:46.267
I also want to thank all of you who planned and did the presentation for the board today.

50:46.287 --> 50:55.190
I know that I was very excited knowing that this was on the agenda as an opportunity to share the work that we are doing on this particular subject.

50:55.510 --> 51:03.573
I also want to make sure we recognize all of the staff both from the Department of Ed as well as from the State Board who are supporting us in doing this.

51:03.613 --> 51:06.494
We're very fortunate to have some very talented

51:07.074 --> 51:13.637
knowledgeable and really passionate experts supporting the work that we're doing on this workforce.

51:13.717 --> 51:15.558
So Patricia is one of them.

51:15.638 --> 51:22.161
And so I want to make sure Patricia DeCos was also included and recognized for the work she's doing in supporting this panel.

51:22.701 --> 51:31.926
One of the things in addition to all the items that were outlined by you and as well by board member Lincoln Ortiz,

51:33.214 --> 51:35.015
I learned so much about data.

51:35.555 --> 51:51.759
And not only do we have some differences in how we look at and think about the students that we share, but we have different ideas and different approaches about and even of different levels of granularity about the kind of data that's collected from among our segments.

51:52.119 --> 51:54.280
And I have learned a lot about that.

51:54.640 --> 52:05.763
For example, the higher ed actually has a data system where they track high school students with a definition and collect information with a definition about college readiness.

52:06.203 --> 52:11.005
They have information about how they track course taking for students.

52:11.345 --> 52:14.706
That has to be informed in this plan we're writing anyway.

52:15.146 --> 52:21.108
And that's one of the areas we're struggling with in our data system to understand how to quantify and record

52:21.548 --> 52:25.211
course taking among the students for career technical education.

52:25.611 --> 52:42.325
I think that the conversations we're learning about the differences, not only in what kind of data is collected, but how that data is used is something that can inform our work, not only for our college and career indicator, but in understanding what we're looking for in quantifying

52:42.705 --> 52:44.966
what the activities are that are at our school.

52:45.386 --> 53:02.994
I'm hoping at some point there's a conversation that we can share from the work that's coming out of this work group with the board that can also inform some of the work on the board, particularly on looking at and defining elements in our college career indicator and also looking at the kind of levels of granular information

53:03.454 --> 53:09.339
that the higher ed, the other segments do collect about students in this area that we currently do not.

53:09.780 --> 53:16.565
I think there's an opportunity for us to figure out how to do some data sharing that can inform and better inform the work we're doing here.

53:18.967 --> 53:19.408
Thank you.

53:19.668 --> 53:20.429
Okay.

53:20.649 --> 53:21.870
Board member Valdez.

53:24.656 --> 53:27.918
I think this is a beautiful concerted effort, and I really thank everyone involved.

53:27.958 --> 53:29.419
I think this is the right work to do.

53:30.200 --> 53:41.008
I feel like the guiding principles are timeless, and so they're going to give you that goal of having the stability and the consistency of the program over time, because that's always the concern with CTE.

53:41.068 --> 53:44.430
It seems funding goes up and down, and right now is a really, really good time.

53:44.470 --> 53:50.775
So I think you're really putting in the infrastructure to be able to weather any future concerns.

53:51.395 --> 53:54.638
I really am excited about the early exploration.

53:54.778 --> 54:00.142
And I think that that is something that has a lot of growth potential, if you will.

54:00.302 --> 54:05.427
And I think that that is a wonderful opportunity to get students to wonder about the possibilities.

54:05.867 --> 54:09.810
And then when you actually get them onto a pathway, you build them for success.

54:09.850 --> 54:12.773
And I think that the data coordination is really important.

54:12.813 --> 54:16.796
It's no longer a black hole when they go on and leave our K-12 system, if you will.

54:17.317 --> 54:18.619
And so the light is now on.

54:18.800 --> 54:21.665
And I think that the coordination is incredibly important.

54:21.686 --> 54:23.489
So I thank you for the synergy and the effort.

54:23.890 --> 54:25.213
And this is very, very exciting.

54:25.253 --> 54:25.674
So thank you.

54:26.886 --> 54:35.431
I'd like to mention, too, last year we spent some of our Perkins leadership dollars and established some middle school grants so that we are already reaching out into middle school.

54:35.931 --> 54:37.412
It was a competitive process.

54:37.492 --> 54:43.596
The schools had to align to one of our California partnership academies, which also then had to feed into community college.

54:43.696 --> 54:48.158
So we've already started the work under Perkins IV down to the seventh grade.

54:48.518 --> 54:51.720
So with the new Perkins, we'll be able to go even further.

54:51.740 --> 54:54.482
Board Member Ortiz-Lacombe.

54:56.834 --> 54:58.675
You know, I gave a lot of my honeymoon comments.

54:59.316 --> 55:22.136
But I do want to go back to board member Cardenas question because we have addressed that question of do we have hierarchies within schools based on academies where we have the high ranking or best perceived academies that are not reflective of the student population or you see diversification in some of the academies that are

55:23.257 --> 55:24.918
seen as less rigorous, right?

55:24.938 --> 55:27.919
And so we have been very open about those conversations.

55:28.620 --> 55:31.221
What students are eligible for what academies?

55:31.261 --> 55:36.484
Do we put extra requirements for engineering versus humanities or whatever it may be?

55:37.384 --> 55:39.505
So those conversations have taken place.

55:39.545 --> 55:40.706
We want to monitor that.

55:40.746 --> 55:47.429
We want to make sure that there is representation, racial representation, linguistic representation of our students.

55:48.009 --> 55:49.970
We also know that there's a lot of work with that.

55:51.551 --> 55:54.832
I run a national college career readiness program.

55:55.333 --> 55:57.714
And we do place students with internships.

55:57.814 --> 55:58.834
Our affiliates do.

55:59.174 --> 56:00.135
That's a lot of work.

56:00.515 --> 56:05.977
When you're looking at students, you need to have them ready for that.

56:06.057 --> 56:12.140
We teach everything from office etiquette to internships to soft skill development.

56:12.600 --> 56:14.823
And then career exploration, right?

56:14.863 --> 56:18.367
And so you have to do a lot of work before you put them out and place them.

56:18.707 --> 56:20.089
And placing them is a lot of work.

56:20.649 --> 56:22.311
You have to look at transportation.

56:22.612 --> 56:23.493
These are minors.

56:23.853 --> 56:26.476
Are there laws that require certain things?

56:26.817 --> 56:27.497
Liability.

56:28.138 --> 56:29.499
It's a lot of work.

56:29.579 --> 56:31.200
This is not to be understated.

56:31.881 --> 56:37.265
And it has to really be streamlined, because in my case, we're doing this nationally.

56:37.385 --> 56:40.307
So every state has different laws about internships.

56:40.667 --> 56:47.473
But you also have students that are part of your K-12 system that are DACA recipients, undocumented.

56:47.793 --> 56:49.874
How does that place into internships?

56:50.255 --> 56:51.756
So there's a lot of things to consider.

56:51.816 --> 56:57.180
If we really want to be equitable, we can't forget those students that may not have the legal means

56:57.640 --> 57:02.125
to be placed in internships and receive payment for that or receive a stipend.

57:02.505 --> 57:04.127
So a lot of things to consider.

57:04.147 --> 57:10.814
I wanted you to know that we are considering those things, at least we're discussing those things during our joint commission meetings.

57:13.877 --> 57:14.638
Board Member Williams.

57:18.928 --> 57:23.432
Yes, I want to thank you for the presentation as well and ask a question.

57:24.953 --> 57:40.165
My longtime colleague, Patrick Perry, who used to be a vice chancellor at the community college system and is now CIO at the California State University system, told me a long time ago, I remembered this just yesterday in a conversation we were having about how do we know

57:42.166 --> 57:48.571
what kinds of salaries or what kind of wages students make based upon where they go to school or what their major is.

57:49.131 --> 57:55.756
And so I sent him a quick email saying, don't I remember that there's actually databases that do this now?

57:55.896 --> 57:59.459
And he sent me back and sent the link back for all three of them.

57:59.499 --> 58:04.382
The community college system, the CSU system, and the UC system all have

58:05.683 --> 58:16.288
open access databases that have tracked the majors and specialties of the programs their students are in and what the average salaries are after they get out.

58:16.688 --> 58:24.251
So I'm curious whether or not the work you're doing will connect to that and utilize that.

58:31.156 --> 58:38.321
I can tell you that part of the work that we're doing is the development of an MOU for data sharing across the two systems.

58:38.481 --> 58:44.866
But it does remain difficult because of the need for social security numbers, FERPA rules, things like that.

58:44.946 --> 58:53.152
But the work continues and the conversation continues with our colleagues in accountability and legal as well as our community college partners as well.

58:53.692 --> 58:53.812
Yes.

58:54.152 --> 59:05.558
So Patrick Perry joined us in one of the data briefings to share his data needs as well as how it overlaps with the needs of this agency as well as the community colleges.

59:05.998 --> 59:11.941
And as Member Rutger mentioned, really we're at a new frontier in terms of data.

59:12.021 --> 59:15.223
Data used to be for the purpose of looking backwards and reporting.

59:15.663 --> 59:22.587
And I think we're all very much more interested in data for the purpose of continuous improvement and informing performance.

59:23.728 --> 59:36.565
And so there's much interest in terms of easing the ability to have this type of data exchange between the agencies so that we would know questions.

59:36.925 --> 59:40.030
Are these programs successful in terms of their intended outcomes?

59:40.730 --> 59:49.255
And one of the things I thought was fascinating about the data, I'm looking right now at the website Salary Surfer, and that's available to students.

59:49.795 --> 59:58.480
That was one of the things that fascinated me about it, is that if a student, and in the context of maybe 10, 15 minutes ago when you were talking about

59:59.841 --> 01:00:08.764
early exploration, middle school and trying to figure out what kids, allowing kids the opportunity to figure out what they're interested in and good at and might be thinking about going into a career.

01:00:09.145 --> 01:00:20.869
They also have access or could be given access to going to these websites and looking, oh, I'm thinking about an English major versus I'm thinking about a computer science major.

01:00:21.689 --> 01:00:25.271
I know from personal experience, that's a big difference because I was an English major.

01:00:26.091 --> 01:00:30.114
And it took quite a bit more education to get somewhere from that point.

01:00:30.194 --> 01:00:43.904
So the fact that this is available for students to go look and see what kind of difference does it make in future earnings, I think could be an important part of the early learning, early exploration of middle and high school.

01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:58.590
I also should mention, too, there's CalCRN, which is the California Career Resource Network, which is the website that's sponsored by the CDE and funded, again, with Perkins leadership dollars that is available for that very same thing and resume building and all of that.

01:00:58.630 --> 01:01:00.170
It's a wonderful tool for our students.

01:01:00.790 --> 01:01:01.170
Thank you.

01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.851
OK.

01:01:04.111 --> 01:01:05.111
No further questions.

01:01:05.151 --> 01:01:06.511
This is an information item.

01:01:06.571 --> 01:01:11.032
Thank you very much for this really enlightening and important question.

01:01:13.729 --> 01:01:15.094
And we have public comment next.

01:01:15.155 --> 01:01:15.415
Yes.

01:01:15.496 --> 01:01:19.048
Would the Angela Reed, Cheryl Ryder, and William McGee please come to the podium.

01:01:36.886 --> 01:01:37.286
Good morning.

01:01:37.606 --> 01:01:38.707
Thank you for allowing me to speak.

01:01:38.747 --> 01:01:39.748
My name is William McGee.

01:01:39.808 --> 01:01:42.530
I'm a school board member in Hayward Unified School District.

01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:47.073
I also sat on the ROP board, so I appreciate this conversation you all are having this morning.

01:01:47.833 --> 01:01:55.058
So also as was stated, NSBA passing the Career Tech Education Act is something that our district looked into.

01:01:55.758 --> 01:02:00.363
Some of the questions that you all were asking, we also entertained as well.

01:02:00.443 --> 01:02:08.431
So some things that our district is looking at is really having human resources understand what career tech education credentials look like.

01:02:08.972 --> 01:02:13.777
That is one of the downfalls since we're traditionally looking at traditional credentials.

01:02:14.197 --> 01:02:18.422
So that's something that the State Board of Education can help educate people on too.

01:02:19.022 --> 01:02:32.028
And then as well as looking at the question of why don't we have CTE teachers, we understand that sometimes or not sometimes, a lot of times it's more lucrative to be in the field that you're working in versus being a teacher.

01:02:32.088 --> 01:02:38.731
So looking at incentives and if you all can assist with that and giving local districts more power to do something, that would be great.

01:02:38.892 --> 01:02:39.852
Thank you for the conversation.

01:02:46.752 --> 01:02:50.915
Good morning President Kirst, Chief Deputy Price, and board members.

01:02:50.955 --> 01:02:57.999
Leangela Reed on behalf of KROP, the California Association of Career and College Readiness Organizations.

01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:06.225
We want to thank you for the incredible work that's going on and the work of the Workforce Pathways Committee and CDE together, state boards.

01:03:06.805 --> 01:03:12.807
I want to thank the Governor for his continued support of CareerTech funding and the integration of funds.

01:03:13.227 --> 01:03:17.329
It's an exciting time and we're very pleased to be part of that.

01:03:18.669 --> 01:03:23.231
I do want to ring to your attention one, what we truly believe is an unintended consequence.

01:03:23.511 --> 01:03:28.753
There's been a great conversation about data today, but there's a little bit of a glitch going on.

01:03:29.373 --> 01:03:33.275
Any grant recipient, it has to upload data into CalPASS+.

01:03:36.236 --> 01:03:39.837
But to do that, you have to put data into CALPADS.

01:03:40.617 --> 01:03:47.659
Since transitioning from CALPASS to CALPASS+, JPAs, ROPs, and county offices have had problems.

01:03:47.999 --> 01:03:51.880
They're blocked from logging into the system because they're deemed not eligible to apply.

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:57.882
We know that you want our MSGPs to be part of the problem, but they're not able to do that.

01:03:57.962 --> 01:04:07.686
We hope that you will direct staff to work with the organizations and the data system so that they can participate and participate in the grant funds.

01:04:07.746 --> 01:04:10.947
They are currently part of CTIG and we think this is important to do.

01:04:12.828 --> 01:04:19.471
And we also want to make, we'd like to be part of a larger group putting together a planning plan.

01:04:19.511 --> 01:04:19.751
Thanks.

01:04:20.871 --> 01:04:24.273
Maybe you can look into this, Deputy Superintendent Price.

01:04:25.093 --> 01:04:25.494
Okay.

01:04:25.734 --> 01:04:26.094
Thank you.

01:04:30.817 --> 01:04:31.317
Good morning.

01:04:31.377 --> 01:04:36.320
I'm Cheryl Ryder, Executive Director for Career Development with the Placer County Office of Education.

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:42.484
And I wanted to speak to a couple of questions that President Kirst had and a comment that Mrs. Rucker had.

01:04:42.504 --> 01:04:44.625
49 ROP was formed in 1974 and by 2008 we had 71

01:04:50.228 --> 01:04:52.069
capstone courses for Pathways.

01:04:52.149 --> 01:05:00.934
So we had Pathways with 71 capstone courses that included work-based learning and this was 2008 before the shift in funding.

01:05:02.034 --> 01:05:08.578
We know that there's been a loss of funding over the years and CTE ROP programs have closed.

01:05:08.658 --> 01:05:09.658
I can attest to that.

01:05:09.758 --> 01:05:10.419
Our programs

01:05:10.899 --> 01:05:15.200
have gone down to about 14% of what we were in 2008.

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:22.621
And the biggest challenge is that those programs, some of them are shifting to the districts and we celebrate that.

01:05:22.681 --> 01:05:33.563
The districts are standing up CTE pathways, but they're really struggling with the work-based learning component, specifically internships and insurance and all those types of things.

01:05:34.343 --> 01:05:37.024
So, although ROPs have decreased,

01:05:37.444 --> 01:05:42.970
The quality pathways have not necessarily met that level that we want.

01:05:43.410 --> 01:05:43.811
Thank you.

01:05:44.191 --> 01:05:52.220
And just the shortage of CTE teachers also includes the fact that LEA contracts don't often consider industry folks.

01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:53.981
They want secondary subject credentials.

01:05:54.182 --> 01:05:54.462
Thank you.

01:05:59.443 --> 01:06:03.548
Eric Premack, Charter Schools Development Center, only partially with my charter hat on today.

01:06:03.909 --> 01:06:10.356
I wanted to tie this back to your discussion yesterday about career and college or career or college.

01:06:11.798 --> 01:06:16.504
Most of the big issues like funding, credentialing, data access, etc.

01:06:16.584 --> 01:06:17.425
are out of your hands.

01:06:18.455 --> 01:06:25.981
But the one issue that's in your hands is this, are we as a state valuing career and college or career or college?

01:06:26.621 --> 01:06:38.489
And I got to tell you, when people come to us and say we want to start a CTE charter school, I say you probably don't want to do it until such time as the state has signaled to you that they value career preparation.

01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:46.475
And so I would urge you before particularly some of you start terming out, take this issue up, resolve it,

01:06:47.701 --> 01:06:48.721
and signal to the field.

01:06:48.961 --> 01:06:49.762
Which do you value?

01:06:50.282 --> 01:06:50.842
And or or?

01:06:52.062 --> 01:06:52.362
Thank you.

01:06:54.903 --> 01:06:55.243
All right.

01:06:55.323 --> 01:06:58.644
We're now on to the waiver issue.

01:07:00.525 --> 01:07:03.586
And we have all the waivers on consent.

01:07:04.686 --> 01:07:06.767
W1 through W17.

01:07:07.547 --> 01:07:11.128
Board member Son must recuse from this entire vote.

01:07:11.308 --> 01:07:13.788
So we will

01:07:16.604 --> 01:07:17.625
Let her go.

01:07:17.785 --> 01:07:21.687
Are there any public comments on these items?

01:07:22.108 --> 01:07:22.288
Yes.

01:07:22.368 --> 01:07:26.230
For waiver 15, would Michael Flores-Castaneda please line up?

01:07:26.791 --> 01:07:32.875
And then for waiver 16, Terry Novak, Kathy Jansen, Linda Barr, Ramel Antone and Michael Flores-Castaneda.

01:07:35.256 --> 01:07:37.958
Tracy Lokman and Leticia Garcia.

01:07:43.762 --> 01:07:44.683
Please come forward.

01:07:45.914 --> 01:07:47.035
Somebody come forward.

01:07:52.759 --> 01:07:54.860
For Waiver 15, Michael Flores-Castaneda.

01:07:57.962 --> 01:07:58.723
Waiver 16.

01:08:04.606 --> 01:08:05.067
Good morning.

01:08:09.096 --> 01:08:10.317
My name is Terry Novacek.

01:08:10.377 --> 01:08:14.380
I'm the executive director with Element Education, which manages Dehesa Charter School.

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:24.987
I just want to share that W-16 is not a new waiver, or it is, excuse me, a new waiver, not an extension of a former waiver.

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:28.150
It is a different section of Ed Code as well as different addresses.

01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:38.217
When we brought our San Diego centers into compliance by acquiring a countywide benefit, our adjacent county centers were no longer compliant.

01:08:38.777 --> 01:08:47.469
We took immediate and continual action by submitting our petition to an adjacent county and are continuing to work with potential authorizers in that county.

01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:55.380
Our goal is to form a partnership rather than creating a strained relationship that results when a charter has to appeal.

01:08:56.101 --> 01:08:58.843
However, if we must, we will follow the appeal process.

01:08:59.443 --> 01:09:02.806
In any case, we are certain we will have this sorted out by next spring.

01:09:03.026 --> 01:09:11.211
We have been serving students in these counties for 17 years and have a centrally located administrative team as well as a local staff to serve the students.

01:09:11.711 --> 01:09:16.255
We have more than 450 students remaining in the school and more than $4 million in reserves.

01:09:16.855 --> 01:09:18.256
We appreciate your consideration.

01:09:25.862 --> 01:09:30.184
Good morning, I'm Kathy Jansen and I'm a regional manager in Riverside County.

01:09:30.204 --> 01:09:36.746
And I want to talk to you about the community that we are able to provide through these learning centers that we have.

01:09:37.346 --> 01:09:41.388
A lot of our students come to us because they're not successful on the five day a week program.

01:09:42.328 --> 01:09:48.192
and they come, but they're isolated if they're doing independent study at home.

01:09:48.732 --> 01:09:56.617
By us providing two powerful days of education, they can come and meet their credentialed teachers twice a week.

01:09:56.737 --> 01:10:02.180
They can work in small groups of 10 to 15 students where they're able to feel successful.

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:19.795
And then we also work with the parents in providing workshops on how to address learning styles of their children, how to integrate the common core standards, and what is a growth mindset and things like that.

01:10:19.835 --> 01:10:24.419
So we're working with parents and students to provide a positive community.

01:10:35.777 --> 01:10:38.618
Hello, I'm Linda Barr, Orange County Regional Manager.

01:10:39.498 --> 01:10:47.059
Our centers are very important for many reasons, but one in particular is that we meet our students' social and emotional needs.

01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:58.782
Our at-risk students suffering with anxiety due to bullying, peer pressure, testing, or disconnectedness flourish in our safe space.

01:10:59.402 --> 01:11:02.243
The culture that we've created is known throughout the community.

01:11:03.323 --> 01:11:06.025
as our enrollment wait list will support.

01:11:06.985 --> 01:11:16.111
Our centers in each county allow our students a place to collaborate as they build robots and apply engineering skills in preparation for tournaments.

01:11:16.931 --> 01:11:21.534
Our award-winning teams competed at VEX IQ Worlds the past two years.

01:11:22.355 --> 01:11:32.000
And finally, we rely on using our centers to meet face-to-face with our special needs students and serve them in an effective and adequate manner.

01:11:32.521 --> 01:11:32.801
Thank you.

01:11:37.352 --> 01:11:37.812
Good morning.

01:11:38.093 --> 01:11:44.557
My name is Tracy Lockman, and I am the AVID district director for our school as well as regional manager for South Riverside County.

01:11:45.398 --> 01:11:48.861
The South Riverside County region has our largest UC-bound students.

01:11:49.561 --> 01:12:04.693
It is imperative that we continue to offer support to these students through our two days a week program, where we offer AVID for four hours a week, our CTE program, wet labs, and tutoring time with our highly qualified teachers.

01:12:05.453 --> 01:12:13.103
These students need our support as they work through their A to G requirements that they need to attend a four-year university.

01:12:13.904 --> 01:12:21.253
It is at these very resource centers that helped our school receive a six-year WASC accreditation this past spring.

01:12:21.594 --> 01:12:23.216
Thank you for your consideration of the waiver.

01:12:27.844 --> 01:12:28.424
Good morning Board.

01:12:28.464 --> 01:12:33.067
Ramel Antoine with the California Charter Schools Association speaking in support of the waiver.

01:12:33.528 --> 01:12:36.129
I think there's some misunderstanding about the nature of the waiver.

01:12:36.589 --> 01:12:46.796
They were trying to come into compliance with Shasta and ultimately have run into some complications in terms of working with local authorizers and they're continuing to do that, putting forward a good faith effort.

01:12:46.816 --> 01:12:48.817
They've been serving students for a long time.

01:12:48.877 --> 01:12:51.499
It's clear that they're doing really strong work so we ask that you support.

01:12:51.759 --> 01:12:52.019
Thank you.

01:12:56.522 --> 01:12:57.883
Eric Premack, Charter School Center.

01:12:58.043 --> 01:13:01.764
In the interest of time, I'll say me too to those comments.

01:13:01.904 --> 01:13:10.608
What I'll also note is we definitely heard you guys when you granted some of the waivers on this topic a little over a year ago that we shouldn't be bringing any back.

01:13:11.088 --> 01:13:15.229
And I think for the most part, we've gotten the message out to the field on that.

01:13:15.409 --> 01:13:15.870
And Ms.

01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:18.411
Novacek and her school clearly understood that as well.

01:13:18.451 --> 01:13:21.272
That's why they've been moving very aggressively at the local level.

01:13:21.732 --> 01:13:24.473
This is, I think, a unique circumstance that's separable.

01:13:25.674 --> 01:13:27.815
And I hope you will give it some consideration.

01:13:27.875 --> 01:13:28.195
Thank you.

01:13:31.797 --> 01:13:32.137
Good morning.

01:13:32.178 --> 01:13:34.359
Michael Flores-Castaneda with the California Teachers Association.

01:13:34.399 --> 01:13:34.879
My apologies.

01:13:34.939 --> 01:13:36.980
It's a little rowdy in the other room and I ran over here.

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:39.782
So first on item W16.

01:13:41.683 --> 01:13:41.883
Sorry.

01:13:42.424 --> 01:13:46.286
On behalf of CTA, we agree with the recommendation to deny the waiver for the following reasons.

01:13:46.726 --> 01:13:49.248
Number one, the students need a caring teacher to guide their learning.

01:13:49.788 --> 01:13:52.829
And CTA believes regular attendance plays a key role in the student's success.

01:13:53.609 --> 01:13:56.230
And also, the students are not doing well in these resource centers.

01:13:56.970 --> 01:14:00.691
The academic performance of these charter school students scored below county averages.

01:14:01.031 --> 01:14:06.592
And lastly, most importantly, with the 2016 Anderson decision, we feel that this decision has already been decided in the courts.

01:14:07.793 --> 01:14:08.093
Thank you.

01:14:08.213 --> 01:14:10.333
Do I speak on 15 now or just come back up?

01:14:10.754 --> 01:14:10.934
Sure.

01:14:15.017 --> 01:14:16.138
Hi, good morning.

01:14:16.218 --> 01:14:35.934
Leticia Garcia on behalf of Riverside County Superintendent of Schools, Dr. Judy White, and I am here also to speak on Waiver 16 in support of the staff recommendation to deny the request for the reasons mentioned when the prior speaker, especially around educational achievement.

01:14:36.975 --> 01:14:44.541
The students served by these resource centers have consistently and historically performed lower than countywide averages.

01:14:45.302 --> 01:14:50.615
and especially with the low-income student population.

01:14:50.695 --> 01:14:54.123
So for these reasons, we also support staff recommendation.

01:14:54.243 --> 01:14:54.544
Thank you.

01:14:58.522 --> 01:15:00.864
Once again, Michael Flores Castaneda with CTA.

01:15:00.944 --> 01:15:06.129
On item W15, I have a letter and I'll have to go back and get it and bring it back because like I said, I ran over here.

01:15:06.810 --> 01:15:13.616
We, CTA, along with the Teachers, Turlock Teachers Association, are opposed to the request for the waiver for W15.

01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:18.100
As a special ed teacher myself, I know all too well the burden that it puts on it.

01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:21.763
My case load last year soared to the point where I really considered leaving my district.

01:15:23.064 --> 01:15:24.805
And it's continually gotten worse through the years.

01:15:24.825 --> 01:15:28.506
I started my first year in Arvin with six students and two instructional aides.

01:15:28.906 --> 01:15:31.947
And last year, I had 15 with two and a half instructional aides.

01:15:33.828 --> 01:15:36.268
So we are asking that you deny the waiver request.

01:15:36.348 --> 01:15:48.292
But if not, the request also is that you would have conditions on the approval with more oversight and monitoring, excuse me, including a monthly report to the special ed division of CDE.

01:15:48.532 --> 01:15:48.833
Thank you.

01:15:49.273 --> 01:15:50.033
And I'll bring the letter back.

01:15:51.917 --> 01:15:52.117
Right.

01:15:52.437 --> 01:15:54.318
That concludes the public testimony.

01:15:54.418 --> 01:16:02.943
So the motion ought to be worded to approve the CDE recommendations on all of the waivers.

01:16:04.924 --> 01:16:10.006
And because some are for denial and some are from approval under the CDE.

01:16:10.106 --> 01:16:13.668
So I'm ready for a motion for W1 through W17.

01:16:13.688 --> 01:16:14.548
To approve.

01:16:18.325 --> 01:16:22.166
the staff recommendations on all of the waivers as listed.

01:16:22.926 --> 01:16:23.327
Second.

01:16:24.507 --> 01:16:25.827
Any board member discussion?

01:16:25.987 --> 01:16:27.688
If not, all those raise your hands.

01:16:27.708 --> 01:16:29.989
Approved unanimously.

01:16:30.009 --> 01:16:35.110
Okay, we're now ready then for the proposed consent calendar items.

01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:37.191
Items 11 through 14.

01:16:37.751 --> 01:16:41.633
These are items on consent.

01:16:41.673 --> 01:16:45.394
Yes, and we have several recusals on item 11.

01:16:47.641 --> 01:16:52.345
We have Karen Valdez and Ting Sun recusing.

01:16:54.527 --> 01:16:57.489
These are numbers 653 and 1030.

01:16:57.809 --> 01:17:06.657
And these were item recusals on those two numbers.

01:17:07.435 --> 01:17:10.378
are by Karen Valdez and Ting Sun.

01:17:10.898 --> 01:17:12.920
So we will take three consent votes.

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:14.501
This is the first consent vote.

01:17:15.082 --> 01:17:17.624
Are there any public comments on these consent items?

01:17:17.944 --> 01:17:19.466
There is no one signed up for public comment.

01:17:19.786 --> 01:17:27.753
Okay, then I'm ready for a motion on item on these two waivers.

01:17:27.773 --> 01:17:29.334
6531030 is the second one.

01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:37.622
Move the staff, move the recommendation for approval of these CONAPs.

01:17:39.383 --> 01:17:39.663
All right.

01:17:39.763 --> 01:17:41.624
All those in favor, raise your hands.

01:17:42.305 --> 01:17:43.325
So we have those.

01:17:44.146 --> 01:18:01.197
Then the second consent vote, which is Feliza and Eileen Strauss must refuse for the rest of the schools and the attachment of these consolidated applications.

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:06.900
And this is item 11 only.

01:18:07.901 --> 01:18:10.842
Move approval of the CONAPS in item 11.

01:18:14.704 --> 01:18:15.904
With the remaining CONAPS, yeah.

01:18:16.645 --> 01:18:17.005
Okay.

01:18:17.065 --> 01:18:18.505
All those in favor, raise your hands.

01:18:23.347 --> 01:18:26.309
And now we have consent items 12 through 14.

01:18:27.689 --> 01:18:29.430
We have no recusals on that.

01:18:31.387 --> 01:18:35.891
So we will get our members back who can vote on these.

01:18:40.195 --> 01:18:42.858
Okay, ready for a motion on that.

01:18:43.318 --> 01:18:44.660
Move those consent items.

01:18:48.083 --> 01:18:53.048
All right, moved and seconded and all in favor raise your hands.

01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:54.451
All right, that's fine.

01:18:55.011 --> 01:18:59.754
Okay, before we take up the next item, let's take a 10-minute break.

01:18:59.794 --> 01:19:01.154
Come back around 10 at 1015.

01:19:01.254 --> 01:19:17.364
Okay, the board will reconvene and we're ready now for item 15 on the Perseverance Preparatory School Material Revision.

01:19:18.192 --> 01:19:25.315
So Lisa will present to us and then we will take technical questions and then public comment and so on.

01:19:30.397 --> 01:19:33.359
Yeah, this will be a public hearing when we get to it.

01:19:42.249 --> 01:19:45.951
Item 15 is for Perseverance Preparatory School.

01:19:46.391 --> 01:19:48.092
It is a request for material revision.

01:19:49.973 --> 01:19:53.775
Perseverance Preparatory School was approved by the State Board back in January.

01:19:53.995 --> 01:20:00.558
They were approved for a grade five through eight for a five-year term July 1st, 2018 through June 30th, 2023.

01:20:01.098 --> 01:20:06.641
There were five conditions as part of that approval and four of those conditions have been met.

01:20:09.591 --> 01:20:13.656
One of the conditions was regarding the facility and the facility lease agreement.

01:20:13.796 --> 01:20:20.964
It stated that by May 15, 2018, Perseverance would provide the CDE with a fully executed facility lease agreement.

01:20:22.674 --> 01:20:29.941
School must open by September 30th, 2018 to retain SBE authorization or be approved for a material revision.

01:20:30.342 --> 01:20:40.332
So on May 29th, 2018, CDE received the request for material revision to delay the opening of school by one year due to the inability to secure a facility.

01:20:42.273 --> 01:20:50.300
CDE is recommending that the State Board hold a public hearing to approve the request for perseverance for a material revision under the oversight of the State Board.

01:20:50.861 --> 01:20:58.968
It will change the opening from 2018-19 to next year 2019-20, but it will continue the same five-year term.

01:20:59.068 --> 01:21:02.471
It will not extend out the five-year term for another year.

01:21:04.764 --> 01:21:15.490
Our recommendation is based on sound educational program that they are demonstratively likely to successfully implement the program and that they're reasonably comprehensive description of most of the charter elements.

01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:19.352
So even with the material revision we do take a look at the petition again.

01:21:19.812 --> 01:21:21.393
We do look at their finances again.

01:21:21.433 --> 01:21:25.295
So we do a whole entire full review even though it is a material revision.

01:21:27.791 --> 01:21:31.734
This item was before the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools on August 14th.

01:21:31.975 --> 01:21:39.701
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools moved staff's recommendation to approve the request for the material revision and the motion was passed unanimously.

01:21:42.122 --> 01:21:46.763
As I mentioned, part of CDE's review, we also took a look at each of those conditions that I mentioned earlier.

01:21:47.384 --> 01:21:56.527
So the four conditions, by January 30, 2018, they were to provide evidence that the board had accepted the SBE conditions of authorization.

01:21:56.787 --> 01:21:58.087
That condition has been met.

01:21:58.807 --> 01:22:08.610
By February 15th of 2018, they were to provide CDE with a revised charter petition containing the necessary changes needed to reflect the SBE as the authorizing entity.

01:22:09.070 --> 01:22:10.391
That condition has been met.

01:22:11.909 --> 01:22:20.395
By May 15th, they were to provide us with verifiable and substantive evidence that they had received the funding anticipated from the Silicon School Fund.

01:22:20.795 --> 01:22:22.316
That condition has also been met.

01:22:23.176 --> 01:22:29.841
By May 15th, they were to provide CDE with a fully executed facility lease agreement, and that is the condition that has not been met.

01:22:29.901 --> 01:22:31.862
That is why we are here today.

01:22:32.563 --> 01:22:40.588
By June 15th, 2018, provide CDE with a revised budget with complete narrative and assumptions, and that condition has been met.

01:22:42.935 --> 01:22:49.558
So CDE did a full review, the sound educational program, and we took a look at the petition again.

01:22:50.458 --> 01:23:01.043
We do feel the petition does provide a reasonably comprehensive description of most of the elements, and we've included that review, the A1 as we call it, as part of the attachments for this item.

01:23:02.083 --> 01:23:08.529
And if the item, if the school is approved by SBE, the following charter elements do still need to be clarified.

01:23:08.589 --> 01:23:14.395
So we will work with the school to clarify some issues we have with the measurable pupil outcomes.

01:23:14.915 --> 01:23:22.782
And then as we have seen in a lot of our petitions about the suspension and expulsion procedures that we're still catching up to with the law.

01:23:22.882 --> 01:23:25.645
So we'll continue to work with the petitioners on that.

01:23:27.412 --> 01:23:31.475
In terms of ability to implement, we did review their multi-year financial plan.

01:23:32.415 --> 01:23:40.600
And based on this first year being a planning year and opening in 19-20, we have reviewed it and feel that it is fiscally viable.

01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:46.244
They do have positive ending fund balances and adequate reserves for the term from 19-20 to 21-22.

01:23:51.423 --> 01:24:04.115
In summary, CDE staff is recommending approval of the material revision based on sound educational program and their fiscal viability and then the clarification of the charter elements in the petition that we will continue to work with the petitioner on.

01:24:04.976 --> 01:24:11.562
I'm here and available for any questions that you may have and I know the petitioner is here as well to give a presentation.

01:24:11.582 --> 01:24:15.306
Okay, do we have technical questions for

01:24:16.693 --> 01:24:17.613
Lisa or not?

01:24:18.053 --> 01:24:22.094
If not, then we will proceed to the public hearing.

01:24:22.194 --> 01:24:27.095
So we're going to do the public hearing and then public comment and then public discussion.

01:24:27.595 --> 01:24:37.017
So I now declare the public hearing open and we will hear from the charter school that's in support of the CDE recommendation.

01:24:44.179 --> 01:24:44.359
Okay.

01:24:44.399 --> 01:24:44.659
All right.

01:24:44.679 --> 01:24:44.859
Sure.

01:24:48.643 --> 01:24:52.488
Good morning, President Kirst and trustees of the board and the CDE staff.

01:24:52.868 --> 01:24:57.574
Thank you for the work that you have done in the thorough review of our charter and petition again.

01:24:58.214 --> 01:25:04.402
My name is Alexandria Lena Talley, and I am the executive director and lead founder of Perseverance Preparatory School.

01:25:06.846 --> 01:25:10.708
I begin with our mission as it's our North Star and guides everything we do.

01:25:11.169 --> 01:25:19.454
While we were only here a few short months ago, it is important to refocus on what Perseverance Prep strives to do.

01:25:20.054 --> 01:25:23.916
Prepare students for a life of ethical leadership and scholarly success.

01:25:24.637 --> 01:25:31.341
We were excited, our community was excited, but unfortunately the timeline proved too tight to launch in a private site for the 2018-2019 school year.

01:25:34.147 --> 01:25:40.350
To give a brief overview of the progress we have made and the timeline since our approval, I direct your attention to the current slide.

01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:44.412
As you know, we were approved on January 19th to open seven months later.

01:25:44.932 --> 01:25:52.696
While it was a tight timeline, we were able to hold our lottery, we were fully hired by May, and we were on track to open.

01:25:53.256 --> 01:25:56.578
However, despite this progress, our board voted to delay on June 27th.

01:25:59.744 --> 01:26:02.645
Our major roadblock, as the CDE mentioned, was our facility.

01:26:03.186 --> 01:26:11.829
Although we submitted a Prop 39 request, San Jose Unified declined the offer to offer us a Prop 39 facility, stating that we had too few signatures.

01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:18.152
We began seeking private facilities in February after we were made aware of the denial of Prop 39.

01:26:18.612 --> 01:26:25.195
However, the City of San Jose considers charter schools as private schools, and thus we must go through different zoning

01:26:27.316 --> 01:26:32.459
zoning and permitting processes, which can take anywhere up to five to six months.

01:26:33.119 --> 01:26:37.721
So while our facilities search was taking place, we were concurrently hiring.

01:26:38.562 --> 01:26:47.046
We received an abundance of teacher applications despite the shortage in San Jose, receiving over 90 applications for six positions.

01:26:48.533 --> 01:26:56.135
As previously stated, we were fully hired by May 18th, 2018, and that they were fully offered contracts and signed.

01:26:58.676 --> 01:27:09.880
Actually today, as of today, as of yesterday, four of the six have signed on for the 2019-2020 school year, which I think is a testament to the belief in our mission and our vision for Perseverance Preparatory School.

01:27:13.171 --> 01:27:18.153
As again, previously stated, we've already begun recruiting for the 2019-2020 school year.

01:27:19.194 --> 01:27:24.697
Given our slow growth model, many of our families, all of our families actually will no longer be able to attend.

01:27:25.297 --> 01:27:30.040
We were gonna begin with fifth grade and then do a slow growth model, adding on a grade every year after.

01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:37.944
And so now that we have pushed back or are hoping to push back for the 2019-2020 school year, those families are no longer able to attend.

01:27:38.324 --> 01:27:40.846
And so we've begun our recruiting over again.

01:27:43.172 --> 01:27:48.077
Again, we thank the CDE very much for all their work that they have done with us over the past couple months.

01:27:48.457 --> 01:27:56.325
We agree with their recommendation and are very eager to work with the State Board as well as the CDE to make any necessary technical amendments.

01:27:57.927 --> 01:27:58.748
Any questions?

01:28:03.465 --> 01:28:03.686
Right.

01:28:03.746 --> 01:28:05.788
We'll have questions later, perhaps.

01:28:05.848 --> 01:28:07.270
So this is a public hearing.

01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:10.233
So we really do a presentation and that's it.

01:28:10.713 --> 01:28:13.476
So if we need to, we'll call you back for questions.

01:28:13.757 --> 01:28:13.877
Right.

01:28:14.397 --> 01:28:14.658
OK.

01:28:14.698 --> 01:28:21.225
Now the opponents to the charter school request will have 10 minutes.

01:28:32.759 --> 01:28:33.419
Good morning, everyone.

01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:36.941
Stephen McMahon, Deputy Superintendent for the San Jose Unified School District.

01:28:36.961 --> 01:28:39.542
I appreciate the time you commit to this process.

01:28:39.643 --> 01:28:41.223
I will open with a little bit of honesty.

01:28:41.243 --> 01:28:51.829
I would much rather be in San Jose supporting the 30,000 students we have and the 3,000 families, but we do feel an obligation on behalf of the school district to make sure that the record accurately reflects the facts.

01:28:52.885 --> 01:28:57.829
We're not in opposition to the revision, but we do want to make sure we're clear about the facility comments.

01:28:58.509 --> 01:29:03.332
So you're receiving a packet with documented evidence showing how we reviewed the Prop 39 request.

01:29:03.813 --> 01:29:10.658
We followed the law, all of the state boards implementing regulations, clear, consistent communication throughout.

01:29:11.638 --> 01:29:16.442
It is absolutely true that facilities in the city of San Jose are incredibly difficult to acquire.

01:29:17.162 --> 01:29:18.804
not just for schools, but for people.

01:29:19.585 --> 01:29:25.172
If you know Silicon Valley is one of the most expensive places to live in the world, that is to raise the prices of everything.

01:29:25.672 --> 01:29:32.320
So it is a challenge for anyone trying to locate a business, a school, housing in Silicon Valley, period.

01:29:33.041 --> 01:29:36.304
But San Jose Unified has a pretty successful track record working with charter schools.

01:29:36.944 --> 01:29:38.505
We have five leases now.

01:29:39.046 --> 01:29:40.907
None of them are officially under Prop 39.

01:29:41.788 --> 01:29:45.811
We've worked really collaboratively with charter school partners to find them facilities.

01:29:46.331 --> 01:29:56.059
Discovery, Ace Middle School, DCP Middle School, DCP High School, Sunrise, all have multi-year lease agreements in San Jose Unified facilities for charter schools.

01:29:56.739 --> 01:29:58.281
We offered to work with Perseverance.

01:29:58.741 --> 01:30:02.584
You can see in the documented communications that we went back and forth on what was possible.

01:30:03.894 --> 01:30:10.417
They do not have 80 students, which is the Ed Code requirement for in-district numbers for Prop 39.

01:30:11.077 --> 01:30:13.938
So what we said is we'll do an in lieu of Prop 39 agreement.

01:30:14.359 --> 01:30:18.120
We offered a facility on February 16 in an in-person meeting.

01:30:19.341 --> 01:30:21.482
It is expensive, but that's Silicon Valley.

01:30:22.222 --> 01:30:25.784
We heard a reply on March 1 and no communication since.

01:30:26.704 --> 01:30:35.592
So we do want to make sure that the record accurately reflects that from February 16th when we met in person to March 1st when we received a written response, there was no subsequent communication.

01:30:36.433 --> 01:30:38.975
We would have been able to make facilities work on the district side.

01:30:39.615 --> 01:30:42.938
We do have classrooms available for 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th grade program.

01:30:43.579 --> 01:30:49.163
We just never heard back from the petitioners at all from March 1st until today.

01:30:49.924 --> 01:30:52.285
So, happy to answer any questions you have.

01:30:52.325 --> 01:30:54.506
We wanted to make sure you had factual evidence in front of you.

01:30:55.026 --> 01:30:58.628
All of the documentation is, of course, a public record, so you can independently verify it.

01:30:59.068 --> 01:31:03.450
And on behalf of the school district and the families we represent, here to support you in your decision making.

01:31:03.470 --> 01:31:12.093
Okay, that now closes that portion of the public hearing, and we're ready for public comment.

01:31:12.954 --> 01:31:14.634
Would the following speakers please line up?

01:31:14.714 --> 01:31:18.196
At the podium, Ona Keller, Eric Premack, and Romel Anton.

01:31:29.705 --> 01:31:32.348
Hi, Ona Keller with the California Teachers Association.

01:31:32.368 --> 01:31:44.159
I'm here with a letter from a coalition of labor, community, and civil rights groups in San Jose who came before you in January asking you to deny both this petition and the next one, Promise, which is also asking for material revision.

01:31:44.219 --> 01:31:45.000
So I'm going to hand that out.

01:31:48.250 --> 01:31:50.332
But I'd just like to make a couple of points.

01:31:51.433 --> 01:31:57.758
You know, as the Deputy Superintendent mentioned, Perseverance did not even have enough enrollment to have a Prop 39 request be granted.

01:31:58.479 --> 01:32:02.542
And as the petitioner said, she now has zero students who are prepared to enroll.

01:32:03.103 --> 01:32:06.966
She's broken a promise to families for this school year and not being able to open.

01:32:07.606 --> 01:32:10.629
And it's really kind of unfair to continue to string families along.

01:32:12.450 --> 01:32:16.051
and forced them to wait another year for a school that again might not open.

01:32:16.451 --> 01:32:25.716
You've actually approved two petitions in the past couple of years that have come back for material revisions and asked to open a year later and then those schools ultimately never opened.

01:32:26.276 --> 01:32:34.280
ISLA actually then came back and asked for another petition, a new petition, and you finally rejected them because you saw that the petitioner was really unlikely to succeed.

01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:37.181
So I urge you to deny this material revision, thank you.

01:32:43.293 --> 01:32:44.214
Good morning again board.

01:32:44.274 --> 01:32:49.118
My name is Ramel Antoine, California Charter Schools Association speaking in support of Perseverance.

01:32:49.538 --> 01:32:51.360
We worked with Perseverance throughout the process.

01:32:51.420 --> 01:32:54.983
They have made every effort to open this year.

01:32:55.023 --> 01:33:03.471
They have set out an action plan and have been really in communication with both the department and with CCSA to get any support possible to ensure that they will be able to open this year.

01:33:03.611 --> 01:33:08.275
Unfortunately facilities as the Deputy Superintendent talked about are really hard for the school.

01:33:08.815 --> 01:33:12.396
They have set out in their submission a plan for what they expect they'll be able to do.

01:33:13.357 --> 01:33:17.378
And with support of Silicon Schools Fund and other funders, they'll be able to get a facility.

01:33:17.498 --> 01:33:18.999
So we ask you to support.

01:33:19.099 --> 01:33:19.419
Thank you.

01:33:25.061 --> 01:33:28.222
Eric Premack, Charter School Center, also in support for the same reason.

01:33:28.443 --> 01:33:36.366
I'll bring up, though, my broken record, which is material revisions to change a start date are unnecessary.

01:33:37.998 --> 01:33:39.058
I'm wasting your time.

01:33:39.078 --> 01:33:40.338
You're wasting your time.

01:33:41.679 --> 01:33:55.021
Start date is not a required charter element and requiring schools to go through this process is just gives a bad incentive and really, again, encourage you to lance this boil.

01:33:55.241 --> 01:33:55.562
Thank you.

01:33:58.382 --> 01:34:02.003
OK, that concludes the public comment and the public hearing.

01:34:02.163 --> 01:34:07.544
So we're now ready for comment from our charter liaison.

01:34:10.110 --> 01:34:25.365
Bruce Holliday Thanks, we have been down this road in the past and It is as we all know always difficult for Charter school to find facilities.

01:34:26.306 --> 01:34:33.192
I appreciate deputy superintendent McMahon information that he's provided us does

01:34:34.682 --> 01:34:40.564
Appear as though The district was trying to to help and that's that's great.

01:34:40.644 --> 01:34:41.285
And that's wonderful.

01:34:41.445 --> 01:34:59.091
And As he said they don't have a conflict with this material revision, but I certainly hope that the charter school and the district continue to try to work together and work out a solution so that the school can start up next next fall

01:35:01.192 --> 01:35:06.800
So of course there may be other questions and all, but I would move the CDE recommendation.

01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:10.881
Board member comment.

01:35:13.303 --> 01:35:13.583
I just.

01:35:14.143 --> 01:35:14.844
Go ahead.

01:35:14.924 --> 01:35:15.785
I just have a comment.

01:35:16.265 --> 01:35:18.107
I would support the recommendation.

01:35:18.807 --> 01:35:23.651
However, I do worry about some of these charters that start a little bit later.

01:35:23.711 --> 01:35:27.695
And we talked about the having enough time before their renewal.

01:35:28.335 --> 01:35:30.537
So I would say four years.

01:35:30.917 --> 01:35:34.260
We're kind of pushing it by three years.

01:35:34.820 --> 01:35:39.084
If they were to come back here again next year, I think it would be very, very difficult.

01:35:42.082 --> 01:35:44.644
Okay, Board Member Rucker.

01:35:46.886 --> 01:35:52.451
I have a question for the charter itself for the person who made the presentation on their charter.

01:35:59.870 --> 01:36:00.050
Okay.

01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:01.591
So, I want to be clear.

01:36:01.651 --> 01:36:06.153
I want to make sure I understand about the conversations you've had with the district.

01:36:06.333 --> 01:36:17.759
I heard from the superintendent that the reason, when you gave your presentation, you said that the district would not give you a Prop 39 facility.

01:36:18.299 --> 01:36:23.582
So, I heard the district's explanation about why they wouldn't give you a facility.

01:36:24.222 --> 01:36:31.406
I don't believe I heard your explanation about why the district didn't give you the facility.

01:36:31.486 --> 01:36:37.589
Could you... And you had a great deal of time to give that explanation, so I'd like to hear that now.

01:36:37.609 --> 01:36:38.530
Sure.

01:36:38.690 --> 01:36:43.132
So, I believe I stated that they did state that we had less than 80 signatures.

01:36:44.973 --> 01:36:49.614
we went back and forth multiple times around what specifically the law requires.

01:36:50.214 --> 01:37:01.558
We did believe that we had 80 signatures and I know another, the other charter school did litigate and ultimately won around what they qualify as being proper signatures.

01:37:01.578 --> 01:37:04.258
At the end of the day, we didn't, our charter did not want to litigate.

01:37:05.099 --> 01:37:10.380
We did try and have a meeting on February with the district to figure out if we could work out an in-lieu agreement.

01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:13.501
It turns out that it was exponentially more

01:37:14.341 --> 01:37:35.346
Costly to do an in-lieu agreement then prop 39 and the facility that they offered was about 25 minutes away from where we had recruited many of our parents and so without transportation or without having kind of the the length of time needed and we chose also to not move forward with an in-lieu agreement with them and

01:37:35.805 --> 01:37:40.709
Okay, so I want to make, I'm going to repeat the essence of what I thought you said.

01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:44.813
And because I missed a couple of things, I know I'm going to say something wrong.

01:37:44.853 --> 01:37:46.254
So, I want you to correct me.

01:37:46.414 --> 01:37:46.654
Okay.

01:37:46.934 --> 01:37:59.085
So, what I heard was you had done the work to recruit your students and you believed that you had the adequate number of students to make the Prop 39 request to the district.

01:38:00.031 --> 01:38:11.480
The district reviewed your submission or the evidence you gave them concerning your enrollment and they disagreed with what you, with the information you presented.

01:38:12.601 --> 01:38:20.026
And so you didn't, so you guys had a back and forth about whether you had 80 or as the district asserts 62.

01:38:20.587 --> 01:38:22.448
And you did that for a little bit of time.

01:38:23.169 --> 01:38:29.734
And then you ultimately decided to take a look at their secondary offer to do an in-lieu agreement.

01:38:30.334 --> 01:38:30.615
Okay.

01:38:30.955 --> 01:38:38.525
So on the in lieu agreement, I heard both of you say that property in San Jose is very expensive.

01:38:38.905 --> 01:38:47.436
And so it was going to be probably prohibitively more expensive than what you were looking at or what your budget that you submitted for your petition was going to be.

01:38:47.496 --> 01:38:47.957
Is that right?

01:38:49.540 --> 01:38:51.862
And so, when did you stop?

01:38:51.922 --> 01:38:57.727
So, in this timeline, the district is saying they didn't hear from you anymore after March.

01:38:57.807 --> 01:39:03.972
When did you all decide to stop with the work to look at another facility?

01:39:05.353 --> 01:39:07.896
We were concurrently looking at private facilities.

01:39:07.916 --> 01:39:07.956
So,

01:39:10.069 --> 01:39:23.382
beginning probably as soon as we were approved, we began looking into both private facility options as well as continuing conversation with the district around both the Prop 39 and then once we were denied, having a follow-up conversation around in-lieu agreements.

01:39:25.344 --> 01:39:27.186
So concurrently, I guess.

01:39:28.072 --> 01:39:28.352
All right.

01:39:28.412 --> 01:39:33.973
So at some point, so in the early spring, I'm going to say March is early spring.

01:39:34.273 --> 01:39:38.114
You became aware that there was going to be a facilities concern.

01:39:38.454 --> 01:39:44.155
What were your conversations about this concern, about having a site to open in the fall?

01:39:44.555 --> 01:39:50.436
What conversations did you have with the parents or the families that you had signed up, who had made the commitment?

01:39:51.136 --> 01:39:55.617
And whether it's 62 or 80, what was the conversation you had had with them?

01:39:56.517 --> 01:40:00.198
about the concern about whether or not you would actually be able to open up.

01:40:00.258 --> 01:40:01.919
When did you have that conversation with them?

01:40:02.399 --> 01:40:03.760
We held our lottery in March.

01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:07.181
We had 152 applications for 128 spots.

01:40:07.641 --> 01:40:13.704
We began holding information sessions in April and then another information session in May.

01:40:14.044 --> 01:40:17.405
We were meeting with, we do home visits with each of our families and our students.

01:40:17.885 --> 01:40:38.721
So we were meeting with our families and very transparently saying we're really looking into a private facility because we knew that it would be quite prohibitive for not only for the cost of an in-lieu agreement but the fact that the site was 25 minutes away from where our families were and in San Jose morning traffic more around 45 minutes and they just wouldn't be able to do that.

01:40:38.861 --> 01:40:44.926
And so we had multiple conversations both through April and May and then ultimately our board voted in June.

01:40:45.666 --> 01:40:49.652
And then we spent most of the summer trying to re-enroll our students in other schools.

01:40:50.914 --> 01:40:51.254
Okay.

01:40:51.514 --> 01:40:53.958
And so, it was 128 families you spoke with, not 80?

01:40:58.055 --> 01:40:58.295
Yes.

01:40:58.455 --> 01:41:01.536
So when we turn in Prop 39, it's due November 1st.

01:41:02.016 --> 01:41:05.657
So we were not actually approved as a charter when we turned in our Prop 39.

01:41:05.697 --> 01:41:06.517
Got it.

01:41:06.917 --> 01:41:09.498
Very interesting how these timelines line up.

01:41:09.858 --> 01:41:12.598
So unfortunately, yes, we did turn those in November 1st.

01:41:12.658 --> 01:41:16.319
And then we held our lottery in March, three months after we had been officially approved.

01:41:16.339 --> 01:41:20.900
And so then during the summer, you spent the time getting the students placed because you knew you weren't going to be able to open.

01:41:21.380 --> 01:41:27.984
And so the last thing that I heard in your presentation is that you're going to have to go back and restart recruitment again.

01:41:28.004 --> 01:41:30.606
And what is that going to look like?

01:41:31.026 --> 01:41:34.889
So we've already begun re-recruiting students for the 2019-2020 school year.

01:41:35.629 --> 01:41:37.330
Frankly, a lot of our students had siblings.

01:41:38.431 --> 01:41:47.397
And so we've begun, we have 32 students who have signed on as meaningfully interested so far and are going to continue to recruit throughout the rest of the year.

01:41:47.737 --> 01:42:04.455
The reason why I'm asking that is given the conversations that you said were quite in depth with the district this year, what do you believe is going to change on your Prop 39 request for next year that you believe will actually result in you getting a facility?

01:42:05.496 --> 01:42:06.256
I think two things.

01:42:06.436 --> 01:42:15.679
One, now that we know the facility that they're likely going to offer at Steinbeck, we've begun recruiting more in that area as opposed to our initial original downtown area.

01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:28.664
We also, now that we are an officially approved charter, have frankly a lot more clout than when we were recruiting and collecting signatures after when we had no charter and had not been officially approved.

01:42:29.264 --> 01:42:31.125
Okay, so I'm going to be really frank with you.

01:42:31.265 --> 01:42:36.467
I wish when you made your presentation that you actually had taken the time to explain this.

01:42:36.927 --> 01:42:55.815
Because the way, one of the problems with the process we have with doing these appeals is that rather than it being a collaborative conversation, which the district clearly said that there is no antipathy toward your application or your petition, that's not the way or that's not the tone

01:42:56.295 --> 01:42:59.457
of the interaction with the district that I actually got from you.

01:42:59.858 --> 01:43:06.463
It would have been better for me for you to say what you just explained to me that I had to cross-examine you to get from you.

01:43:06.503 --> 01:43:07.724
You don't need to apologize.

01:43:08.104 --> 01:43:19.893
But coming here to this board on an appeal and setting up a presentation that suggests that there's great antipathy or even a conflict with the work that you need to do to get you to open your school.

01:43:20.373 --> 01:43:22.354
You know, that creates a concern for me.

01:43:22.394 --> 01:43:33.977
I'm not going to say you were not, you were dishonest, but you were not fully disclosing everything that was under consideration for that would support the reasons why you really believe you need to have this extension.

01:43:34.317 --> 01:43:46.521
It helps me understand better why you believe having the extension gives you the time you need to do the work because you understand what your recruiting strategy needs to be and how the work will go forward.

01:43:46.841 --> 01:43:48.662
So I understand that a little bit better.

01:43:49.222 --> 01:44:02.107
So, for this facility, if you can get the Prop 39, that will maintain your fiscal concerns, and that will resolve the issue with looking for private facilities, and you would be able to go forward to do the work that you need to do with the district?

01:44:02.407 --> 01:44:02.607
Yes.

01:44:03.288 --> 01:44:03.628
Okay.

01:44:03.648 --> 01:44:05.308
So, now I have a question with the district.

01:44:05.489 --> 01:44:06.489
Thank you very much.

01:44:06.729 --> 01:44:06.829
Yes.

01:44:06.849 --> 01:44:11.091
And apologies again for... Oh, I didn't... I wasn't pointing that out to you to make you apologize.

01:44:11.111 --> 01:44:12.691
I didn't mean to ask you to apologize.

01:44:12.751 --> 01:44:14.132
It's not why I asked those questions.

01:44:14.652 --> 01:44:14.992
Thank you.

01:44:15.252 --> 01:44:16.413
I have a question for the district.

01:44:20.879 --> 01:44:20.940
Hmm.

01:44:25.891 --> 01:44:38.254
Okay, so what I heard from the presentation from the charter school is they believe that next year when they go back to do the work to part of the reason, okay, let me start over.

01:44:38.594 --> 01:44:52.037
Part of the reason that was a problem for them with the facilities you were offering is that it was physically in an area or a location that was away from the central core of the student population and the neighborhood they recruited.

01:44:52.077 --> 01:44:53.057
Did I misstate that?

01:44:54.284 --> 01:44:55.245
That is also what I heard.

01:44:55.506 --> 01:44:55.786
Okay.

01:44:56.287 --> 01:45:05.538
So, a part of the reason that they are asking for this extension and this time to open is that they have an understanding from you about this facility.

01:45:05.558 --> 01:45:10.164
Is the facility that she named the facility that you're offering to them for Prop 39?

01:45:11.025 --> 01:45:11.225
Yes.

01:45:11.585 --> 01:45:11.886
All right.

01:45:12.186 --> 01:45:24.214
And so she believes that if she has the opportunity to do the recruiting because she did indicate she would have to start over with recruiting and they were responsible to make sure the students that they had were placed and started school this year appropriately.

01:45:24.574 --> 01:45:32.519
She believes the opportunity to recruit students in that community will bear fruit and they'll be able to open their school at the school site.

01:45:32.699 --> 01:45:37.983
Is that your understanding that you would be able to next year also offer her that school site?

01:45:39.670 --> 01:45:41.330
So a little bit longer answer on this one.

01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:44.711
San Jose is a complicated city.

01:45:44.751 --> 01:45:46.872
There's 19 school districts in one city.

01:45:47.512 --> 01:45:49.213
There are many charter schools in the county.

01:45:49.693 --> 01:45:52.794
Very few of them enroll by boundary.

01:45:52.914 --> 01:45:57.775
So it's very common that a charter school would have 60% in district, 40% out of district.

01:45:58.496 --> 01:46:00.016
So it's always going to be expensive.

01:46:01.245 --> 01:46:07.430
One of my obligations being in charge of the finances is these are not my facilities nor are they Santa's Unified's.

01:46:07.810 --> 01:46:08.771
They're the taxpayers.

01:46:09.512 --> 01:46:13.134
We have to ensure that we're using them the most efficient and effective way possible.

01:46:13.755 --> 01:46:19.559
The school the petitioners are talking about out at Steinbeck formerly had a grade 6, 7, and 8 program.

01:46:20.220 --> 01:46:23.102
It was upgraded facility-wise to accommodate middle school students.

01:46:23.182 --> 01:46:25.063
It's ready to serve middle school students.

01:46:26.144 --> 01:46:31.608
It was a small school model that families were not enrolling at a high rate at, so we routed them to different middle schools.

01:46:31.648 --> 01:46:35.912
So we now have idle classrooms for grades 6, 7, and 8 ready to go.

01:46:36.032 --> 01:46:38.214
And that's why this facility is being offered.

01:46:38.834 --> 01:46:42.377
We understand it's not as close to their original desired outcome.

01:46:44.269 --> 01:46:48.151
But again, that's one of the challenges of having a really big city, big county.

01:46:49.172 --> 01:46:54.294
We feel like we shouldn't reconfigure other school sites when there are classrooms already available.

01:46:54.795 --> 01:47:02.319
So the offer that it was available this fall is likely to be available, or sorry, the past fall is likely to be available again.

01:47:02.939 --> 01:47:13.585
If they have the number of students necessary for Prop 39 request, this facility, we have been holding it for a charter school lease, anticipating that there'll be a requester.

01:47:14.835 --> 01:47:24.065
Okay, so my other question is not related to an issue in the charter, but the issue she raised for the parents concerning transportation.

01:47:24.505 --> 01:47:29.971
You said that you have open enrollment from most of the school sites in your district.

01:47:30.371 --> 01:47:33.014
How are the transportation issues resolved?

01:47:33.474 --> 01:47:40.515
For those students is their transportation provided by the school the LEA or how do parents resolve that issue on transportation?

01:47:40.735 --> 01:47:58.979
And this is not material to the charter itself, but I want to understand what the concern was this year for her aside from And for the non for the for the offer you were making I want to make sure I understand the transportation issues They were considering when they made the decision not to go forward with this alternative offer

01:47:59.674 --> 01:48:07.978
So from the district's experience on February 16th, we identified the site and said we're happy to work through all of the necessary logistics to make it happen.

01:48:08.498 --> 01:48:09.539
We never heard a response.

01:48:09.879 --> 01:48:13.961
Okay, what would be the, was transportation one of those necessary logistics?

01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:21.346
It was not raised at the time we talked about it, but we've provided transportation to two of the charter schools, at least from us.

01:48:21.646 --> 01:48:23.047
That's what I was waiting to hear.

01:48:23.127 --> 01:48:25.409
So we, you know, we're a school district.

01:48:25.469 --> 01:48:28.752
If they're in-district students, we're going to provide the full host of services.

01:48:28.912 --> 01:48:30.594
Okay, so that's what I was waiting to hear.

01:48:30.614 --> 01:48:37.499
Do you want to emphasize, though, in the same way we do that for the 30,000 families we already represent.

01:48:37.780 --> 01:48:38.060
Okay.

01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:41.543
We have board policies on what qualifies for transportation and what doesn't.

01:48:42.361 --> 01:48:45.343
there are thousands of families that wish we had a different bus route.

01:48:46.223 --> 01:48:52.247
We don't have the ability to redirect the taxpayer resources to accommodate every individual request.

01:48:52.887 --> 01:48:58.290
One of the challenges the district faces with the charter request is you cannot pinpoint the sites

01:49:00.279 --> 01:49:01.219
if they're not available.

01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:06.121
Because no family has the ability to say, I want my neighborhood school located here.

01:49:06.901 --> 01:49:07.581
I want it closer.

01:49:07.681 --> 01:49:13.263
So we take the facilities we have, we take the needs of the requester, and we try to best match them.

01:49:13.823 --> 01:49:19.024
Same as we do with a lease for the YMCA or any other partner that's using school facilities.

01:49:19.104 --> 01:49:19.804
What are their needs?

01:49:19.844 --> 01:49:20.405
What do we have?

01:49:20.445 --> 01:49:21.065
Let's match them.

01:49:21.545 --> 01:49:25.086
But with ACE, we provided bus transportation for ACE students.

01:49:25.526 --> 01:49:26.886
We provided them for DCP.

01:49:27.066 --> 01:49:28.387
Often when the facilities

01:49:29.167 --> 01:49:34.391
were in flux or construction was going on and families were going to have to have a different challenge getting to school.

01:49:34.972 --> 01:49:39.956
We transport about 2,000 non-special education students on a daily basis.

01:49:39.976 --> 01:49:43.259
I mean, we have one of the bigger networks in the state of California.

01:49:43.279 --> 01:49:43.699
We love it.

01:49:43.759 --> 01:49:44.080
If you would

01:49:44.540 --> 01:49:46.521
help push for some more transportation funding.

01:49:46.581 --> 01:49:49.883
Having that block grant locked over time is pretty restrictive.

01:49:49.943 --> 01:49:53.185
So if you could sweeten the transportation funding, we could even do more of that.

01:49:53.525 --> 01:49:53.806
Okay.

01:49:53.846 --> 01:49:55.066
Transportation is an option.

01:49:55.106 --> 01:49:56.387
Student nutrition is an option.

01:49:56.807 --> 01:50:02.571
All of those things are in the facility lease agreements we have with all five of the charters that have lease agreements already.

01:50:02.851 --> 01:50:03.131
Okay.

01:50:03.211 --> 01:50:03.952
Thank you very much.

01:50:03.972 --> 01:50:05.552
I appreciate your answers.

01:50:07.193 --> 01:50:07.854
Karen Valdez.

01:50:10.291 --> 01:50:13.033
If you wouldn't mind coming back up, I'm sorry, I have a quick question.

01:50:15.394 --> 01:50:16.135
I have two questions.

01:50:16.175 --> 01:50:20.697
So one, could you remind me on the Prop 39, it's due to you in November, is that correct?

01:50:20.777 --> 01:50:20.997
Yes.

01:50:21.278 --> 01:50:23.959
And so in November, then they will have a list of students.

01:50:24.019 --> 01:50:29.442
You will verify whether or not they are residents of your district to be sure you get to that trigger number, correct?

01:50:29.642 --> 01:50:29.902
Yes.

01:50:30.143 --> 01:50:32.784
And so we're kind of in the same loop that we were last time.

01:50:33.184 --> 01:50:39.268
So this is predicated on them having enough by November and that they're verified that they are residents of your district.

01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:41.064
and the appropriate age.

01:50:41.424 --> 01:50:42.046
And the appropriate age.

01:50:42.106 --> 01:50:45.253
So a junior cannot petition to be at a fifth grade facility.

01:50:45.293 --> 01:50:45.594
Correct.

01:50:45.654 --> 01:50:47.098
And how do you do your verification?

01:50:49.602 --> 01:50:52.844
So specific to this, it was just the form submitted.

01:50:53.404 --> 01:50:59.607
So we looked at the addresses that were presented, put them in the standard website search that tells you the local school districts.

01:50:59.667 --> 01:51:00.947
We look at the age of the students.

01:51:01.607 --> 01:51:03.588
You can see in your packet, there's examples.

01:51:04.329 --> 01:51:07.870
Each student we remove from the eligibility list, you can see why we did it.

01:51:08.530 --> 01:51:11.532
One of the challenges in San Jose is the boundaries.

01:51:11.552 --> 01:51:16.074
19 school districts with an address of San Jose.

01:51:16.674 --> 01:51:18.455
Many of the parents aren't always sure

01:51:19.025 --> 01:51:22.707
that they're in San Jose Unified or Alum Rock or Evergreen.

01:51:22.807 --> 01:51:25.289
So the address check is complicated.

01:51:25.789 --> 01:51:29.732
We do that, and then we do proof of age and match it to age.

01:51:29.812 --> 01:51:33.134
So in the next hearing, process is a little bit different.

01:51:33.174 --> 01:51:39.618
But for Perseverance, it was just we looked at the submissions, verified the accuracy of the information presented, and it was 62.

01:51:40.598 --> 01:51:46.922
And there was no subsequent disagreement over our methodology when it came to the Perseverance review.

01:51:47.375 --> 01:51:47.875
OK, thank you.

01:51:47.895 --> 01:51:51.518
And then I have one question for the director, the executive director of the charter.

01:51:58.144 --> 01:52:06.050
So if you don't qualify for Prop 39 this coming November, I know you said that it takes the city permits and all of those things.

01:52:06.891 --> 01:52:10.014
My question is, can you afford the rent there now?

01:52:10.234 --> 01:52:14.998
And why couldn't you afford it last spring if it's not Prop 39?

01:52:15.578 --> 01:52:15.838
Sure.

01:52:15.858 --> 01:52:19.201
So we had two church facilities that we were in lease negotiations with.

01:52:19.842 --> 01:52:27.749
And while we were pretty far down the line with those lease negotiations, it just so happens that the certificate of occupancy is what's actually required.

01:52:27.789 --> 01:52:30.331
And it's not the matter of money.

01:52:30.411 --> 01:52:31.472
It's just the matter of time.

01:52:32.073 --> 01:52:37.237
So the city of San Jose operates a little slower than one would like sometimes.

01:52:37.297 --> 01:52:39.800
And so they said that it would take around six months.

01:52:39.860 --> 01:52:42.542
And we had just submitted it in about

01:52:44.136 --> 01:52:44.837
April or May.

01:52:44.857 --> 01:52:45.717
OK.

01:52:45.737 --> 01:52:49.901
And then finally in the district's letter where it said they needed notification by March 1st.

01:52:50.722 --> 01:52:52.183
Why did you go silent after that.

01:52:52.924 --> 01:52:55.546
So our lawyers and I'm happy to bring up.

01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:58.711
one of them, Janelle.

01:52:59.491 --> 01:53:04.614
We had back and forth, and I had back and forth with our lawyers on what is and is not required of Prop 39.

01:53:04.975 --> 01:53:18.302
We knew we had, again, after those conversations with our teachers and our families, that they could not make that commute, that it was better to just go with these private sites.

01:53:18.342 --> 01:53:26.387
And we actually didn't find out that the private sites wouldn't work and that the certificate of occupancy permitting process would take six to seven months until much later on.

01:53:28.251 --> 01:53:33.035
So you made a decision to not engage and rather just wait it out.

01:53:33.975 --> 01:53:39.680
We made a decision to move forward with private facilities instead of try and sign a lease.

01:53:39.740 --> 01:53:43.042
That's three times what we initially had budgeted.

01:53:48.727 --> 01:53:50.068
Board member Holliday is next.

01:53:50.748 --> 01:53:53.430
Well, I appreciate the board members questions.

01:53:54.131 --> 01:53:54.431
Thank you.

01:53:55.523 --> 01:53:58.804
I appreciate the board members' questions to get down deeper and understand it.

01:53:59.584 --> 01:54:06.546
Sometimes Member Williams and I, who know a lot of the background story, don't want to take too much of your time going through all the details.

01:54:06.626 --> 01:54:12.348
But it's good to go through all the details, in particular because I think in this case, one thing that is very clear is how

01:54:14.016 --> 01:54:28.586
thorough, professional, and helpful the district has been with this charter school and made good efforts at every step of the way to try to make this work, although their price is a little high, I guess, for the MOU.

01:54:29.167 --> 01:54:41.715
But it also, I think, once again, because of this discussion, illustrates just how clearly and professionally, or how clearly the charter school has worked

01:54:43.968 --> 01:54:57.099
through the process as best as they can with the right intentions, taking care of their families, making sure that their families were notified, making sure that the families were clear about the school not opening.

01:54:57.500 --> 01:55:03.705
In addition to that, we have to remember that they have more options now than they had last year.

01:55:04.599 --> 01:55:05.399
They have more time.

01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:07.200
They have more facility options.

01:55:07.460 --> 01:55:13.443
They're working through the private school process in San Jose.

01:55:15.104 --> 01:55:22.147
My sense is that the deputy superintendent continues to want to work with this school very successfully.

01:55:22.967 --> 01:55:25.969
And in addition to that, they have more time to recruit.

01:55:26.349 --> 01:55:28.350
And they have a better idea of where they're going to recruit.

01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:33.488
So with all those things in mind, I repeat my motion, the CDE recommendation.

01:55:34.730 --> 01:55:36.313
And we have that seconded.

01:55:36.533 --> 01:55:36.914
Okay.

01:55:37.294 --> 01:55:37.595
Yeah.

01:55:39.598 --> 01:55:39.819
Yeah.

01:55:39.999 --> 01:55:40.279
Okay.

01:55:40.339 --> 01:55:42.022
I'd like to wind this up soon if we can.

01:55:42.955 --> 01:55:51.646
Yes, but I do feel like I need to qualify my vote because I abstained originally when we voted for this the first time and I like to be consistent.

01:55:52.387 --> 01:56:00.698
This does not speak, I acknowledge the challenges that charter schools have identifying facilities in mature cities, in particular in the area

01:56:01.398 --> 01:56:06.702
in Northern California because everything's so expensive here as well as in LA, as well as California as a whole.

01:56:07.122 --> 01:56:14.867
So I wanted to qualify why I'm abstaining from this vote simply because I want to be consistent with my vote with the original charter.

01:56:16.468 --> 01:56:18.970
Okay, I think we're ready then for a vote on this.

01:56:19.110 --> 01:56:21.151
All those in favor, raise your hands.

01:56:22.332 --> 01:56:25.614
Okay, so we have one abstention.

01:56:28.396 --> 01:56:28.696
One no.

01:56:29.835 --> 01:56:30.175
Nose.

01:56:31.716 --> 01:56:31.976
Nose.

01:56:32.436 --> 01:56:32.837
One no.

01:56:33.597 --> 01:56:35.318
Two nos.

01:56:36.759 --> 01:56:36.939
No.

01:56:37.779 --> 01:56:40.700
Two abstentions.

01:56:40.761 --> 01:56:41.361
Call the roll.

01:56:41.441 --> 01:56:41.601
Yeah.

01:56:41.621 --> 01:56:42.661
All right.

01:56:42.681 --> 01:56:43.622
We'll call the roll.

01:56:44.362 --> 01:56:45.063
Bruce Holliday.

01:56:45.083 --> 01:56:45.143
Yes.

01:56:46.463 --> 01:56:46.784
Hema.

01:56:48.084 --> 01:56:48.664
Okay.

01:56:49.325 --> 01:56:49.525
Nikki.

01:56:49.565 --> 01:56:49.645
Yes.

01:56:50.746 --> 01:56:51.266
Okay.

01:56:51.346 --> 01:56:51.586
Trish.

01:56:51.606 --> 01:56:51.686
Yes.

01:56:53.287 --> 01:56:53.527
Ting.

01:56:53.547 --> 01:56:53.627
Yes.

01:56:54.647 --> 01:56:54.908
Mike.

01:56:55.348 --> 01:56:55.648
Yes.

01:56:56.228 --> 01:56:56.568
Eileen.

01:56:56.588 --> 01:56:56.689
Yes.

01:56:57.469 --> 01:56:57.609
Sue.

01:56:57.629 --> 01:56:57.749
Yes.

01:56:58.670 --> 01:56:59.150
Feliza.

01:56:59.170 --> 01:56:59.410
Yes.

01:57:00.114 --> 01:57:00.434
Okay.

01:57:00.514 --> 01:57:03.157
Karen and Patricia.

01:57:03.917 --> 01:57:04.218
Okay.

01:57:04.278 --> 01:57:06.039
We have two no's and two abstentions.

01:57:07.761 --> 01:57:08.041
Okay.

01:57:08.061 --> 01:57:09.002
The motion carries.

01:57:09.062 --> 01:57:11.544
So now we're ready for the Promise Academy.

01:57:43.621 --> 01:57:48.715
Okay, item number 16 is for Promise Academy and this is a request for a material revision.

01:57:50.523 --> 01:58:02.652
Promise Academy was approved by the State Board of Education on January 19, 2018 for grades TK through eight for a five-year term, July 2018 through June 2023.

01:58:03.553 --> 01:58:06.074
There were three conditions as part of this approval.

01:58:06.295 --> 01:58:11.879
Two conditions have been met and the one condition regarding the facility lease agreement has not been met.

01:58:12.339 --> 01:58:19.124
By June 15, 2018, the Promise Academy Board will provide CDE with a fully executed facility lease agreement.

01:58:21.326 --> 01:58:28.555
School must open by September 30th, 2018 to retain SBE authorization or be approved for a material revision.

01:58:29.116 --> 01:58:37.667
So on May 29th, 2018, we received a request for a material revision to delay the opening by one year due to the inability to secure a facility.

01:58:39.815 --> 01:58:48.385
CDE is recommending that the State Board hold a public hearing to approve the request for Promise Academy for the material revision under the oversight of the State Board.

01:58:48.885 --> 01:58:57.054
It will change the opening from 18-19 this school year to next school year 19-20 for a five-year term and again not extending that five-year term.

01:59:01.141 --> 01:59:12.646
The recommendation is based on the sound educational program that the petitioner is demonstratively likely to successfully implement the program and a reasonably comprehensive description of most of the charter elements.

01:59:14.626 --> 01:59:25.651
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools met on August 14, 2018 and the commission moved staff's recommendation to approve the request for a material revision and the motion passed unanimously.

01:59:28.559 --> 01:59:32.563
As part of our review, we took a look at whether the petitioners met the condition.

01:59:32.983 --> 01:59:40.471
So the conditions by June 15, 2018, they were to provide a revised budget with a positive three-year ending fund balance.

01:59:40.831 --> 01:59:42.273
And this condition has been met.

01:59:42.953 --> 01:59:50.721
By June 15, 2018, provide a revised charter petition containing the necessary changes needed to reflect the state board as the authorizer.

01:59:51.322 --> 01:59:52.904
This condition has also been met.

01:59:53.505 --> 02:00:00.517
And then by June 15th as well, they were to provide the CDE with a fully executed lease agreement and this condition has not been met.

02:00:03.089 --> 02:00:05.330
We did a full review of the educational program.

02:00:05.430 --> 02:00:13.015
The petition does provide a reasonably comprehensive description of most of the charter elements and that is included in attachment one of the item.

02:00:13.736 --> 02:00:19.799
And if approved by the state board, there are some areas in the charter petition that will need to be clarified.

02:00:20.280 --> 02:00:30.466
Those include a description of the educational program, measurable pupil outcomes, governance structure and again suspension and expulsion procedures.

02:00:32.717 --> 02:00:41.884
In terms of the ability to implement, we did do a review of the multi-year financial plan based on 18-19 being a planning year and opening 19-20.

02:00:42.765 --> 02:00:48.389
Initially, the multi-year financial plan is not fiscally viable without the silicon funds.

02:00:49.070 --> 02:00:55.715
We have received commitment letters that have stated that those funds are definitely coming forward for the school.

02:00:56.255 --> 02:01:09.253
So with the inclusion of those funds and the confirmation we received in the commitment letters, the school does have positive ending fund balances and adequate reserves for the 19-20 through 21-22 fiscal years provided those funds are secured.

02:01:15.071 --> 02:01:28.218
In summary, CDE staff is recommending approval of the material revision based on a sound educational program, fiscal viability provided the funds are secured, and clarification of the charter elements in the petition.

02:01:29.319 --> 02:01:31.460
And I'm available here for any questions that you may have.

02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:34.581
Okay, do we have any technical questions on this?

02:01:35.882 --> 02:01:43.086
If not, then I declare the public hearing open and we'll first take the petitioners for the charter school.

02:01:53.675 --> 02:01:59.260
There you go.

02:02:00.161 --> 02:02:00.401
Morning.

02:02:00.441 --> 02:02:00.961
I think it's morning.

02:02:00.982 --> 02:02:08.308
Good morning, members of the board, city staff, guests, and on behalf of the families of Promise Academy, my name is Dr. Anthony Johnson.

02:02:08.328 --> 02:02:09.029
I'm the school founder.

02:02:10.170 --> 02:02:15.234
I'd like to talk about a few things today that kind of chronicle our journey to this point.

02:02:15.594 --> 02:02:19.258
A little bit about Promise Academy, as a reminder, milestones we've met,

02:02:20.009 --> 02:02:27.457
our timeline to get to this point, the CDE recommendation, and then our next steps for our August 2019 opening, provided that we approve today.

02:02:29.671 --> 02:02:37.194
So Promise Academy is a small K-8 school founded by a group of parents who live and work in and near downtown San Jose.

02:02:37.735 --> 02:02:44.738
We present a unique option for all families but especially low-income families and families of color who traditionally wouldn't have a school option of this nature.

02:02:45.918 --> 02:02:49.120
Our option focuses on personalized education.

02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:56.783
We use methods of small group instruction and hands-on applied math, science, and engineering in partnership with the Tech Museum of Innovation.

02:03:02.754 --> 02:03:07.796
So I just want to highlight a couple of the milestones that are relevant to today's hearing.

02:03:08.436 --> 02:03:16.618
We were awarded two additional large grants that are going to help us to continue to engage families and refine our instructional model over our extended planning year.

02:03:17.939 --> 02:03:19.559
Parent engagement has been tremendous.

02:03:20.139 --> 02:03:23.220
We have received about 180 applications.

02:03:23.620 --> 02:03:29.402
We have a consistent core group of about 40 to 50 parents who we meet with frequently to keep our momentum going.

02:03:32.310 --> 02:03:33.251
So this is really important.

02:03:33.291 --> 02:03:34.331
This is our timeline.

02:03:35.152 --> 02:03:40.896
So in November, just as the charter school before us, we submitted our Prop 39 application for facilities.

02:03:41.536 --> 02:03:48.561
We submitted more than 300 meaningful interest forms that were verified on the San Jose Unified website.

02:03:48.681 --> 02:03:49.702
We punched in the addresses.

02:03:50.022 --> 02:03:50.943
They were of age.

02:03:51.583 --> 02:03:53.485
And so all of these we felt qualified.

02:03:54.125 --> 02:04:01.611
About two days after we were approved here in January, we received a notice that we would be denied facilities under Prop 39.

02:04:04.656 --> 02:04:05.296
We pushed forward.

02:04:05.316 --> 02:04:07.777
We reached out to the district to engage in talks.

02:04:08.157 --> 02:04:09.778
We did meet in February with the district.

02:04:10.278 --> 02:04:11.798
There were no formal offers made.

02:04:12.158 --> 02:04:14.859
There were some requirements around an in-lieu-of lease agreement.

02:04:15.219 --> 02:04:23.602
One of those was that they would have to kind of canvas the local school communities to decide whether or not the school wanted us to be at that site and also whereas the

02:04:24.182 --> 02:04:30.567
Typical rate for a school our size would have been $120,000 to lease our pro rata share of space.

02:04:31.187 --> 02:04:37.872
It was the lease agreement that they verbally talked about was over $500,000 annually for the same amount of space.

02:04:40.073 --> 02:04:41.795
Also, we attended board meetings.

02:04:42.375 --> 02:04:53.443
We reached out to board members, requested a meeting, and ultimately we had to take legal action in early March to attempt to have a judge to objectively look at the policy interpreted for us.

02:04:54.710 --> 02:04:56.470
In the meantime, we were looking at private facilities.

02:04:56.870 --> 02:04:59.571
We had a beat on a perfect private facility in our area.

02:04:59.991 --> 02:05:07.633
However, when we met with the city and we sat down and we mapped out the timeline, it was clear that the timing of things wouldn't work out.

02:05:09.553 --> 02:05:18.355
We should have received a facility offer on February 1st, which I truly believe if we had have, no matter where the location of the facility would have been, we would have been able to make it work.

02:05:19.284 --> 02:05:20.284
But the process drug out.

02:05:20.725 --> 02:05:24.326
Even after our lawsuit, there were multiple motions filed by the local school district.

02:05:25.186 --> 02:05:26.627
And all were eventually struck down.

02:05:26.827 --> 02:05:34.070
And then in June, the judge issued a mandate that we be offered space in the amount that we originally requested.

02:05:34.710 --> 02:05:40.372
He also ruled that the efforts to delay us and to prevent us from opening were subjective, arbitrary, and capricious.

02:05:42.259 --> 02:05:45.781
On July 23rd, we received a final facilities offer.

02:05:46.621 --> 02:05:54.265
And although we requested any six of the downtown school sites, all of which have between 200 and 400 empty seats, we replaced that.

02:05:54.285 --> 02:05:58.247
And to put it in context, there are over 40 school sites within the local school district.

02:05:58.587 --> 02:06:12.613
We were put at the one school site that was furthest away from our families, the same site that was offered to the previous charter school, which was Allen at Steinbeck, which constitutes approximately a two-hour round-trip commute for families in San Jose traffic, both for drop-off and pickup.

02:06:17.361 --> 02:06:22.989
So, first of all, I just want to thank the CDU staff for the recommendation to approve and also the ACCS Commission.

02:06:23.470 --> 02:06:25.352
We've been working closely with CDU staff.

02:06:25.392 --> 02:06:27.555
We have our monthly check-ins, and they've been extremely helpful.

02:06:27.976 --> 02:06:30.039
And we look forward to continuing to work with them.

02:06:31.917 --> 02:06:34.759
Our next steps are we've put together a facilities team.

02:06:34.999 --> 02:06:37.360
We've actually been working with a broker for the past 10 months.

02:06:37.681 --> 02:06:43.244
We are now entertaining three private facilities that we look to make an offer on here within the next few weeks.

02:06:44.445 --> 02:06:50.789
Our team consists of myself, two of our board members, one of which is a commercial real estate agent, and our two brokers.

02:06:51.509 --> 02:06:59.234
We also recognize that Prop 39 is our legal right, and we're hoping that the law is followed in this upcoming year.

02:06:59.574 --> 02:07:00.415
We will submit our

02:07:01.696 --> 02:07:04.760
our request by November 1st with the adequate number of signatures again.

02:07:05.882 --> 02:07:15.576
And seeing that we receive our offer on February 1st, we are planning to offer transportation anticipating that it may be at the same school site that was previously offered.

02:07:17.768 --> 02:07:24.290
As far as families are concerned, right now, we started about two weeks ago offering free tutoring to all of our families who have applied with us and registered with us.

02:07:25.531 --> 02:07:33.954
It doubles as piloting our instructional model and we're able to really work out kinks and report out to families on what kids are learning and stay engaged with our families.

02:07:34.574 --> 02:07:40.763
We had our registration kickoff this past August 26, so about a weekend ago, and it was well attended.

02:07:42.125 --> 02:07:45.070
We also continue to have semi-monthly parent leader meetings.

02:07:45.090 --> 02:07:48.315
We've been doing that for the past two years, and those efforts have continued.

02:07:50.160 --> 02:07:54.464
We had a number of applicants to apply to our school, and so we're staying in relationship with those current applicants.

02:07:54.904 --> 02:08:03.371
We're holding, starting next week, monthly socials for educators where we're kind of vetting and talking through our school model and hopefully bringing on some rock star teachers here.

02:08:03.832 --> 02:08:14.020
Our internal goal is to be fully staffed by December of this year, and our immediate goal is to hire two lead teachers so that we can begin training the trainer model.

02:08:14.420 --> 02:08:17.343
So as we bring on staff, we'll be ready to go here in the spring.

02:08:19.862 --> 02:08:25.367
Lastly, here are some pictures on the left side of our last parent meeting a couple of weeks ago.

02:08:25.687 --> 02:08:33.974
You can see that our kids are present and we're also working through small intricate details of the school, like our school motto, our school chant, our uniform policy.

02:08:33.994 --> 02:08:36.456
So we want our parents to be intricately involved in every part of the school.

02:08:37.076 --> 02:08:41.279
We do span multiple grade levels and so we're not starting from scratch with our enrollment.

02:08:41.820 --> 02:08:48.065
We have a core group of families who are still engaged and who are still eligible for our school.

02:08:49.185 --> 02:08:53.468
In fact, in the middle, you'll see the flyer that we use to promote our kickoff event.

02:08:53.948 --> 02:09:00.952
And that baby that you see right now, there now, is about two and a half years old walking around.

02:09:01.012 --> 02:09:02.693
So that's how long we've been in this journey.

02:09:03.713 --> 02:09:06.535
And on the right side, you'll see pictures from the event.

02:09:06.595 --> 02:09:15.720
And on the bottom of that, you'll see some of our kiddos working in our app school tutorial program, where they're in our innovation lab, and they're doing science and engineering projects.

02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:19.884
So in closing, we continue to have great momentum.

02:09:20.245 --> 02:09:22.908
We're physically stable and viable.

02:09:23.569 --> 02:09:33.300
And while the delay was definitely not the plan, it may prove to have positive effects on helping us to engage even more families and start our school with an even stronger academic program.

02:09:34.842 --> 02:09:35.022
Thank you.

02:09:48.564 --> 02:09:51.888
Good morning, Steve McMahon, Deputy Superintendent for the Santa Fe School District.

02:09:52.088 --> 02:09:58.135
Really appreciate the questions from the earlier agenda item and hopefully we can get a little bit more in depth on this one as well.

02:09:59.176 --> 02:10:01.558
Very different process between perseverance and promise.

02:10:02.119 --> 02:10:05.323
Much more disputes regarding the signatures and the verification.

02:10:07.128 --> 02:10:08.009
I am a bureaucrat.

02:10:08.550 --> 02:10:10.312
I don't think there's anything negative in that term.

02:10:10.592 --> 02:10:12.034
I'm a steward of other people's money.

02:10:12.655 --> 02:10:16.740
It is my job to make sure we use it the most efficiently and to the best uses possible.

02:10:17.641 --> 02:10:20.024
They're taxpayer investments, public school facilities.

02:10:20.324 --> 02:10:24.589
They're the anchors of many neighborhoods, and we take this work incredibly seriously.

02:10:25.390 --> 02:10:30.431
As a bureaucrat, I live in the land of laws, regulations, court orders.

02:10:31.232 --> 02:10:35.113
I don't make PowerPoints without documentation to support it.

02:10:35.653 --> 02:10:39.594
So in your packet, you'll see evidence of an overview of this process.

02:10:40.634 --> 02:10:42.195
It is a very challenging one.

02:10:42.895 --> 02:10:50.277
There are some ambiguities in what we think is the Prop 39 process and verifying residency and age and all those pieces.

02:10:50.377 --> 02:10:54.658
Specific to Promise, we did have a dispute regarding the meaningful interest.

02:10:55.970 --> 02:10:59.671
Promise sought judicial relief, and they were granted that judicial relief.

02:11:00.491 --> 02:11:12.235
The district made a facility offer exactly as Promise requested, 20,000 square feet for 197 in-district students at a K-8 facility because you approved a K-8 charter school.

02:11:12.795 --> 02:11:17.877
The district only has two K-8 schools in the entire 41 school inventory.

02:11:18.437 --> 02:11:21.958
There are only two TK-8 schools in our inventory.

02:11:22.478 --> 02:11:24.759
We offered the one that had available classrooms.

02:11:25.499 --> 02:11:27.942
in complete compliance with the judge's order.

02:11:28.743 --> 02:11:35.370
Again, we're not here before you today disputing or recommending or supporting your material vision.

02:11:35.850 --> 02:11:41.216
We just want to make sure the record accurately reflects they had a facility exactly as requested.

02:11:42.938 --> 02:11:47.002
Needing a material revision because the district didn't give them the facility is not accurate.

02:11:47.462 --> 02:11:51.766
Under the court order, they were offered exactly what they requested to the letter.

02:11:52.126 --> 02:11:52.927
It is expensive.

02:11:53.407 --> 02:11:54.948
It's not in the location they preferred.

02:11:55.529 --> 02:12:02.495
But I would welcome you to visit San Jose with me and visit all the families that in 2000 and 2002 had neighborhood schools closed.

02:12:03.416 --> 02:12:06.738
None of the 30,000 families have the school exactly where they want.

02:12:07.399 --> 02:12:10.422
You often have to adjudicate boundary disputes with districts.

02:12:11.397 --> 02:12:16.421
Part of the democracy is it's tough to know where to draw the boundary, where to locate the neighborhood school.

02:12:16.982 --> 02:12:21.706
If San Jose Unified has the facilities available and we offer them, we've done the best we can.

02:12:22.306 --> 02:12:27.791
We were not going to go into a downtown school and reconfigure a K-5 elementary to be a K-8 school.

02:12:28.431 --> 02:12:34.014
nor we were going to disrupt the learning environments of existing schools when we had available space somewhere else.

02:12:34.735 --> 02:12:36.096
So we're happy to answer any questions.

02:12:36.776 --> 02:12:37.676
Superintendent is here.

02:12:37.716 --> 02:12:40.858
She wants to add some comments regarding the verification process.

02:12:41.559 --> 02:12:46.382
We really do think it's important that there's a better understanding of what happened through this process.

02:12:47.042 --> 02:12:50.344
But for my part, as a bureaucrat, we got a court order.

02:12:50.464 --> 02:12:51.124
We followed it.

02:12:52.005 --> 02:12:57.388
The material revision is unnecessary because the facilities exactly as requested were delivered.

02:13:00.848 --> 02:13:01.308
Good morning.

02:13:01.328 --> 02:13:02.428
I'm Nancy Albrot.

02:13:02.448 --> 02:13:04.149
I'm the superintendent of San Jose Unified.

02:13:04.289 --> 02:13:07.889
Thank you for the opportunity to address this particular issue.

02:13:07.970 --> 02:13:18.072
So I am here today because it's really important for me that we have on the public record our concern about this particular school when it comes to the students attending this school.

02:13:18.612 --> 02:13:24.193
So I don't dispute that there was legal action and that we were required to provide facilities.

02:13:24.853 --> 02:13:37.185
In that process, we determined that we needed to go out and talk to the families to confirm some of the statements that have been made by Promise about how the district has harassed parents or intimidated parents.

02:13:37.605 --> 02:13:39.767
And I want to give you some context around that.

02:13:40.367 --> 02:13:41.428
I am a Latina leader.

02:13:41.869 --> 02:13:43.390
I have led in this community.

02:13:43.450 --> 02:13:44.611
I've taught in this community.

02:13:44.631 --> 02:13:46.693
I've been a principal in the downtown area.

02:13:46.954 --> 02:13:48.175
I've been a bilingual director.

02:13:48.855 --> 02:13:50.816
And I grew up in a home of immigrants.

02:13:50.836 --> 02:13:52.116
My parents are both immigrants.

02:13:52.616 --> 02:14:00.439
So I believe that I have the cultural competency and the respect and professionalism to dialogue with parents face to face.

02:14:01.019 --> 02:14:08.722
So I, with my bilingual assistant, went to the homes of the families that Promise Academy alleges we harassed on the telephone and intimidated.

02:14:09.282 --> 02:14:11.483
I took the enrollment forms that they gave us.

02:14:11.743 --> 02:14:13.203
I showed them the enrollment forms.

02:14:13.724 --> 02:14:17.405
Story after story, parents told me that they were approached in a parking lot.

02:14:17.885 --> 02:14:21.666
outside of Safeway in a church.

02:14:21.686 --> 02:14:31.690
A table was set up at a neighboring charter school, and they were being told that they needed to sign these forms, that it was a form of support.

02:14:32.430 --> 02:14:36.211
Those are all declarations and depositions that are in the court papers.

02:14:36.251 --> 02:14:37.112
So you can see those.

02:14:38.092 --> 02:14:40.453
I think about that as a leader of this district.

02:14:41.053 --> 02:14:43.794
I would be appalled if any of my principals

02:14:44.714 --> 02:14:51.263
sold a program to families in a parking lot, at a table, or outside a church.

02:14:51.424 --> 02:14:59.575
I would expect what I expect for all my community, my very diverse community, from my most privileged families to my families that are living in the most distress.

02:15:00.396 --> 02:15:10.191
Every family deserves an overall comprehensive program description, a place to come together to review and answer questions.

02:15:10.952 --> 02:15:15.238
I believe that parents need to be, you know, asking questions and engaged.

02:15:15.979 --> 02:15:21.645
I don't think that these parents particularly, they did not believe that they had a comprehensive overview.

02:15:21.945 --> 02:15:25.028
They thought they were signing forms in support of a school opening.

02:15:25.389 --> 02:15:26.350
So I confirm that.

02:15:26.490 --> 02:15:35.880
I understand what the court, what the judge says, but I know and my board knows and the community knows that the school is an opening because there's not interest.

02:15:36.460 --> 02:15:40.906
There are some families that want this school, but there is not the 80 that are required.

02:15:41.246 --> 02:15:51.640
And so I will gladly, as a superintendent, go into a school and have a dialogue with a community about interest and needing to co-locate when there are the 80 required.

02:15:52.461 --> 02:16:00.785
I don't believe that disrupting some of my communities that are already in distress because there's a handful of people that would like the school in their neighborhood.

02:16:02.425 --> 02:16:04.546
I don't believe that that's the fair way of doing this.

02:16:04.967 --> 02:16:15.631
And so I just want you to be aware of that and really hold some of these schools that are being authorized accountable for treating and engaging with parents in a respectful and professional manner.

02:16:16.011 --> 02:16:19.173
The same standard that we have for our regular public schools.

02:16:20.353 --> 02:16:26.556
Because I don't believe that the way these engagement conversations happened are reflecting that.

02:16:27.196 --> 02:16:30.638
So with that, if you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer any of them.

02:16:32.018 --> 02:16:32.739
Okay, thank you.

02:16:32.879 --> 02:16:37.901
I declare the public hearing closed in that phase and now we're ready for public comment.

02:16:43.211 --> 02:16:45.114
With the following speakers, please come to the podium.

02:16:45.334 --> 02:16:55.551
Eric Premack, Ramel Antoine, Justin Choi, Tanita Plattementier, Julie Chae Kim, Maria Guadalupe, and Dean Elias.

02:17:13.584 --> 02:17:13.964
May I begin?

02:17:15.284 --> 02:17:16.545
Hello, my name is Justin Choi.

02:17:16.565 --> 02:17:21.826
I am a student volunteer and a firm believer in the importance of our public education system.

02:17:24.286 --> 02:17:34.008
In the San Jose Unified School District, approximately only 36% of our low income Latino students met requirements to apply for our state universities.

02:17:34.028 --> 02:17:34.008
36%.

02:17:35.989 --> 02:17:37.209
Our schools should be doing a better job.

02:17:38.956 --> 02:17:41.418
Waiting for schools to improve on a district level could take decades.

02:17:42.239 --> 02:17:49.205
Promise Academy is one of the best options we have in order to address the needs of the students of low-income families in San Jose.

02:17:50.366 --> 02:17:59.534
The school model involves deep engagement of student learning through small group practice, which is exactly what many of our students need to break the cycle of educational inequity and poverty.

02:18:00.455 --> 02:18:02.177
I'm here because I believe in Promise's mission.

02:18:02.597 --> 02:18:03.398
Please approve their delay.

02:18:11.843 --> 02:18:13.163
Eric Premack, Charter School Center.

02:18:13.264 --> 02:18:19.846
We think highly of this group as well and would urge you to approve the extension.

02:18:20.966 --> 02:18:28.169
We do, though, as I noted earlier, think that these are unnecessary and you've heard my song and dance on that.

02:18:28.249 --> 02:18:28.509
Thank you.

02:18:37.810 --> 02:18:38.990
Good morning, board members.

02:18:39.151 --> 02:18:40.351
My name is Tanita Palaman.

02:18:40.471 --> 02:18:42.432
I have a current sixth grader and a kindergartner.

02:18:42.812 --> 02:18:45.173
I am deeply disappointed that we have to meet this way again.

02:18:45.673 --> 02:18:46.754
I live in San Jose.

02:18:46.854 --> 02:18:48.194
I commute to Concord for work.

02:18:48.634 --> 02:18:50.375
I am well aware of traffic in the Bay Area.

02:18:50.915 --> 02:18:58.358
In order for me to drop my child off at Allen, I would have to drive south, sit in traffic and drop them off, then sit in traffic on my way to work.

02:18:58.638 --> 02:19:00.439
This is the same for most of our families.

02:19:00.919 --> 02:19:06.260
It would take other families and myself at least an extra hour round trip to drop them off at Allen.

02:19:06.720 --> 02:19:13.441
If San Jose Unified School District had given us a fair location in downtown San Jose, it would be on my way to work making the commute a lot easier.

02:19:13.821 --> 02:19:18.622
It's ridiculous that what San Jose Unified School District has put us through to delay Promise Academy.

02:19:19.042 --> 02:19:20.923
My son and daughter started school last month.

02:19:21.223 --> 02:19:26.624
Because of this delay, my daughter and other current sixth graders will not be able to attend Promise Academy.

02:19:27.364 --> 02:19:29.866
I feel hurt, upset, and very emotional.

02:19:30.226 --> 02:19:32.848
I had dreamed of my kids being able to attend the same school.

02:19:33.228 --> 02:19:36.790
I am still hopeful my son and his peers will be able to attend Promise Academy.

02:19:37.091 --> 02:19:37.411
Thank you.

02:19:50.965 --> 02:19:51.425
Good morning.

02:19:51.805 --> 02:19:58.609
My name is Julie Chacom and I'm a parent to a kindergarten at Rocketship.

02:20:00.410 --> 02:20:03.951
I've been working to bring Promise Academy to downtown San Jose since 2016.

02:20:04.332 --> 02:20:07.853
You're with Rocketship?

02:20:16.278 --> 02:20:16.738
I'm sorry.

02:20:20.370 --> 02:20:24.392
because there are no good schools in downtown San Jose.

02:20:29.374 --> 02:20:32.996
So I've been involved for about two years and

02:20:37.720 --> 02:20:55.966
So I've gone through both the verification of the phone call with the superintendent, Nancy Alvaron, and as well as I've also toured the high school or the school, Allen and Stanbeck.

02:20:56.826 --> 02:21:03.448
So I just wanted to clarify on the phone verification for our parents, for the families who lives in downtown.

02:21:04.148 --> 02:21:23.211
I think that some of the conversation that confused our family because the questions were asked if the family going to Promise Academy and then when the family asked where is Promise Academy because at the moment we didn't have a location and the staff said I don't know.

02:21:23.231 --> 02:21:23.311
Time.

02:21:25.131 --> 02:21:30.194
And so, and also with the school, Allen Stanback, it's very far too far for us.

02:21:30.954 --> 02:21:39.879
And that is not possible and that's not really, really solving the problem of the people in our downtown areas who have, does not have good schools.

02:21:40.319 --> 02:21:43.941
So please approve the delay for Promise Academy for our children.

02:21:44.001 --> 02:21:44.341
Thank you.

02:21:49.997 --> 02:21:50.617
Good morning, board.

02:21:51.018 --> 02:21:55.500
Romel Antoine again with the Charter Schools Association speaking in support of the material revision.

02:21:55.840 --> 02:21:59.322
It is clear through their presentation that they have thought through all the scenarios.

02:21:59.702 --> 02:22:01.363
They will have more time this time around.

02:22:01.463 --> 02:22:06.306
They have assembled a facilities team to look at several private facilities.

02:22:06.386 --> 02:22:08.987
They've gone through the legal process for Prop 39.

02:22:09.347 --> 02:22:10.268
They've made their case.

02:22:11.148 --> 02:22:15.591
If you look through the documents that they submitted, they actually provided a bunch of different options to the school district.

02:22:16.051 --> 02:22:19.234
trying to work with them to be collaborative, to say, here's where our families are.

02:22:19.614 --> 02:22:21.256
Let's work together to make this a reality.

02:22:21.336 --> 02:22:22.837
And the district chose not to do that.

02:22:23.237 --> 02:22:31.204
In fact, to offer them something that was much more expensive than any school should have to pay, private or public charter or public.

02:22:32.265 --> 02:22:33.466
So there's that.

02:22:33.586 --> 02:22:41.313
And then it's, you know, normally what we see when schools get approved by anybody and they take some time, they usually are taking their time away from the community.

02:22:41.893 --> 02:22:50.595
Promise is actually dialing down and doubling down in the community, providing tutoring services and keeping engaged with those families, keeping them involved in Promise Academy.

02:22:50.996 --> 02:22:51.816
We urge you to approve.

02:22:51.916 --> 02:22:52.256
Thank you.

02:22:56.257 --> 02:22:58.077
Ona Keller, California Teachers Association.

02:22:58.097 --> 02:23:03.119
I just refer back again to the letter that I passed out earlier about both Perseverance and Promise.

02:23:03.639 --> 02:23:10.681
This board recognized that Promise's petition, especially in its high school, was actually illegal, which is why you took the high school portion off.

02:23:11.261 --> 02:23:14.003
We're back here again asking for more changes to their petition.

02:23:15.364 --> 02:23:18.046
San Jose Real Estate is getting, if anything, more expensive.

02:23:18.106 --> 02:23:21.909
Google is about to come into downtown and open up a number of office buildings.

02:23:21.969 --> 02:23:29.234
And so it's unclear to me how giving this school another year will allow them to actually have facilities that will work for them.

02:23:29.974 --> 02:23:31.435
The district offered them Prop 39 facilities.

02:23:32.936 --> 02:23:41.180
they met their requirements and it's unclear why you should be able to give them another year when they did have facilities available.

02:23:41.500 --> 02:23:42.901
That's what this material revision is about.

02:23:42.941 --> 02:23:44.962
They weren't able to meet it because they didn't want to.

02:23:45.162 --> 02:23:45.462
Thank you.

02:23:45.482 --> 02:23:57.948
Hola, mi nombre es Maria Guadalupe Garcia.

02:23:58.828 --> 02:24:00.709
Para mi la escuela de Promise Academy

02:24:02.589 --> 02:24:15.660
Es diferente en la comunidad de San Jose porque vamos a crear una nueva familia unida.

02:24:16.120 --> 02:24:22.485
Tengo a dos hijos de edades separadas que requieren apoyo diferente.

02:24:23.646 --> 02:24:26.068
Un modelo pequeño es necesario.

02:24:26.308 --> 02:24:28.931
Promise nos saca de la batalla que

02:24:30.490 --> 02:24:34.314
Enfrentamos en la educación comunitaria.

02:24:35.415 --> 02:24:45.246
Estamos ansiosos para que nuestra escuela, por fin ahora, el próximo año, se abra.

02:24:45.686 --> 02:24:48.890
Por favor, ayúdenos con esto.

02:24:49.270 --> 02:24:49.771
Gracias.

02:24:51.772 --> 02:24:54.434
Hello, my name is Maria Guadalupe Garcia.

02:24:54.854 --> 02:25:00.578
For me, Promise Academy is different in the community of San Jose because it is creating a unified family.

02:25:01.018 --> 02:25:04.641
I have two children in separate age groups that require different support.

02:25:05.301 --> 02:25:06.962
A smaller model is necessary.

02:25:07.403 --> 02:25:11.225
Promise gets us out of the battle that we face in the educational community.

02:25:11.665 --> 02:25:14.547
We are anxious to finally open our school next year.

02:25:14.788 --> 02:25:15.928
Please help us with this.

02:25:16.269 --> 02:25:16.649
Thank you.

02:25:27.383 --> 02:25:27.843
Good morning.

02:25:28.865 --> 02:25:30.166
I'm Dean Elias.

02:25:30.226 --> 02:25:32.408
I'm the chair of the board for Promise Academy.

02:25:33.569 --> 02:25:41.037
I just want to affirm, as I've done in the past, that this is an extraordinarily brilliant proposal for a school.

02:25:41.798 --> 02:25:48.525
And among the things that has made it brilliant is the way that parents have been actively involved at each step of the way.

02:25:49.505 --> 02:25:59.231
And the way the dealing with parents was referenced by the district, I think, is disrespectful for the reality that the parents have experienced.

02:26:00.872 --> 02:26:12.759
Among the things that I think is extraordinary is the quality of the school leadership and the quality of the parent participation, all of which augurs well with the success of Promise Academy.

02:26:13.520 --> 02:26:13.880
Thank you.

02:26:14.040 --> 02:26:16.922
I hope you'll choose to approve the request.

02:26:18.143 --> 02:26:20.124
Okay, that concludes the public comments.

02:26:20.164 --> 02:26:22.346
So now we're ready for board member discussion.

02:26:24.007 --> 02:26:27.169
Board member Holliday will make first comments.

02:26:27.309 --> 02:26:27.609
Thanks.

02:26:28.230 --> 02:26:31.092
I'm sure a number of board members have a number of questions.

02:26:31.132 --> 02:26:34.154
I'm not going to try to go through all of the details now.

02:26:34.174 --> 02:26:35.735
I'll let you all filter those out.

02:26:37.056 --> 02:26:44.881
Unfortunately, this relationship between this charter school and the same district has not been quite as smooth.

02:26:45.121 --> 02:26:46.522
And there have been some definitely

02:26:49.057 --> 02:26:49.618
Bitter moments.

02:26:50.218 --> 02:27:07.232
I do sincerely appreciate once again that the district and the superintendent have deputy superintendent and superintendent of the district have shown up to clarify from their perspective what happened and to make sure that their voice is clearly heard and I suspect that

02:27:09.201 --> 02:27:17.335
Once again, their approach to the situation has been for the best intent of children, and that is great.

02:27:17.696 --> 02:27:20.921
And that's what we're all here for, and that's what we're all spending our time doing.

02:27:24.039 --> 02:27:36.250
this Prop 39 situation is that it is incredibly difficult for both a charter school in a Prop 39 situation as well as a district in a Prop 39 situation.

02:27:36.690 --> 02:27:44.277
It's terribly difficult to suddenly think about, first of all, back up

02:27:45.150 --> 02:27:54.035
100 years when I was running a charter school in Oakland, and we were being kicked out of a facility, and we were considering Prop 39 through the Oakland district.

02:27:55.255 --> 02:28:02.999
The idea of co-locating with another school is tremendously difficult to begin with.

02:28:03.240 --> 02:28:09.943
But then suddenly, the offer is 10 miles away, 5 miles away, or even 1 mile away from where

02:28:10.373 --> 02:28:15.723
the families who began the process, who were part of the process, are located.

02:28:15.944 --> 02:28:17.046
That's terribly difficult.

02:28:17.367 --> 02:28:18.208
At the same time,

02:28:19.733 --> 02:28:34.285
I can't imagine how painful it would be for a district to have a full school in the desired location for the charter school and say, well, we're going to have to move some of our students out so these charter kids can come in here.

02:28:34.325 --> 02:28:34.886
That's terrible.

02:28:34.986 --> 02:28:36.227
No, no.

02:28:36.767 --> 02:28:38.289
It's a really tough situation.

02:28:38.809 --> 02:28:41.531
I don't fault the district in this situation at all.

02:28:41.972 --> 02:28:45.034
And I don't fault the charter school in this situation.

02:28:45.135 --> 02:28:47.336
And that's the reality of Prop 39 situations.

02:28:49.571 --> 02:29:10.018
That being said, once again, I do believe that not only did this board vote to approve this charter in January, whenever it was, the ACCS voted unanimously to provide this extension of time.

02:29:11.638 --> 02:29:16.360
And the department agrees to give them this extension of time.

02:29:17.375 --> 02:29:21.897
I know it's been a difficult and rocky time between the district and this charter school.

02:29:22.557 --> 02:29:26.198
And I'm hoping that they will come together, find common ground again.

02:29:27.138 --> 02:29:34.101
And once again, I do believe with this extension of time that the charter school has more options now for facilities.

02:29:34.961 --> 02:29:35.981
It may not work out.

02:29:36.221 --> 02:29:40.683
That could, you know, if it doesn't, then we need to rethink perhaps.

02:29:41.663 --> 02:29:43.424
But there's more options now.

02:29:43.464 --> 02:29:44.544
There's more time now.

02:29:45.194 --> 02:29:53.569
And I think we ought to give them that opportunity based upon our vote, ACCS vote, and the CDE's recommendation.

02:29:53.750 --> 02:29:55.272
Thank you.

02:29:55.292 --> 02:29:56.074
Board Member Williams.

02:29:59.056 --> 02:30:10.442
If I haven't told you this recently, Member Holliday, this is one of the reasons I so respect and am grateful to have you as a partner in this tough charter school stuff.

02:30:11.062 --> 02:30:20.927
The fact that you've run a charter school, a couple of charter schools before, and you know from experience what it's like, what all the relationships are like.

02:30:22.027 --> 02:30:25.871
That's not a background or experience that I come from.

02:30:25.911 --> 02:30:33.118
And you always have a way of just cutting right down to what's important and doing it in a way that respects everybody that's involved.

02:30:33.138 --> 02:30:34.339
I really appreciate that.

02:30:35.520 --> 02:30:36.721
I agree with you.

02:30:36.741 --> 02:30:42.066
I was a, I read the promise petition

02:30:43.688 --> 02:30:44.408
pretty carefully.

02:30:44.508 --> 02:30:45.769
I don't read every petition.

02:30:45.809 --> 02:30:47.670
That's why we have staff.

02:30:48.431 --> 02:31:07.985
But with Promise, I was very, very intrigued with the petition, with what they plan to do, how they plan to do it, the intensity of their focus on low-income kids of color, and the research-based way that they went about putting together their instructional model.

02:31:09.225 --> 02:31:14.126
the compelling personal story of the school director operator.

02:31:16.606 --> 02:31:20.107
And that's one of the reasons I voted to approve it in the first place.

02:31:20.947 --> 02:31:24.988
And I frankly would have approved the high school part of it.

02:31:25.928 --> 02:31:35.650
I think having all of the students on individual education plans takes care of most concerns about, you know, what they would be doing and how they would be advancing.

02:31:36.190 --> 02:31:36.430
But

02:31:37.830 --> 02:31:41.813
agree with you that we agreed, we approve them.

02:31:41.933 --> 02:31:46.577
The ACCS has recommend giving them an extension for the reasons that you cite.

02:31:47.377 --> 02:31:54.282
The CDE is recommending it as well and I second your motion to move the CDE's recommendation.

02:31:55.877 --> 02:32:02.384
I know there's more comment, but as I understand, we're not here to again reconsider the whole charter.

02:32:02.524 --> 02:32:05.827
So, I mean, we spent two and a half hours on that.

02:32:06.668 --> 02:32:09.571
And, you know, this is a different kind of request.

02:32:09.651 --> 02:32:14.516
So I would like us to speak to the particular issue, which is the facility issue.

02:32:14.637 --> 02:32:15.898
Board Member Ortiz-Lacombe.

02:32:16.986 --> 02:32:17.847
I'm going to speak to that.

02:32:19.027 --> 02:32:25.472
So I also have been on both sides working within a district, reading charter proposals, working with charters.

02:32:25.912 --> 02:32:27.753
So I understand how difficult this is.

02:32:28.654 --> 02:32:29.795
And I do agree.

02:32:29.815 --> 02:32:30.975
I think both of you are right.

02:32:31.055 --> 02:32:35.578
You know, on one end, there is a lot of hustle with getting those signatures needed.

02:32:36.059 --> 02:32:39.721
And you are approaching parents in parking lots, in churches.

02:32:40.121 --> 02:32:46.606
But I do commend the Promise Academy for engaging, authentically engaging parents now during this gap year.

02:32:47.547 --> 02:33:01.157
So my question has to do, maybe Lisa you can answer this, because this is about facilities and it says that the CDE notes that the PA petition did not include a plan for acquiring and securing facilities during the 2018-2019 planning year.

02:33:01.758 --> 02:33:04.700
So if this is about facilities and there is no plan,

02:33:06.762 --> 02:33:08.744
Do you know what the plan is?

02:33:08.784 --> 02:33:17.635
Lisa, if you want to come forward and maybe answer this question because we're here specifically to entertain the facilities plan, but that's what's missing from this petition.

02:33:18.021 --> 02:33:18.181
Right.

02:33:18.221 --> 02:33:21.162
We didn't have an actual plan of how they were going to move forward.

02:33:21.742 --> 02:33:30.043
We knew that they were from what they had told us about the litigation and how they were moving forward with San Jose, that they were going to try again for Prop 39.

02:33:30.943 --> 02:33:34.004
But there wasn't anything formally submitted to us for that.

02:33:34.124 --> 02:33:40.805
So this would allow give them obviously some more time to then determine how they would move forward before the November 1st deadline.

02:33:41.425 --> 02:33:46.026
But we didn't actually have anything concrete written out, I would say.

02:33:46.443 --> 02:33:53.105
So what happens now if they are given the extension, if we approve it, then how do you work with them?

02:33:53.125 --> 02:33:59.166
How do you monitor that they're actually keeping to a timeline, that there's a facility, that there's going to be an opening?

02:33:59.186 --> 02:34:04.888
Because I agree with Member Sun, if it doesn't open next year, I think it would be really hard for them to actually open.

02:34:05.589 --> 02:34:17.395
We will, we can, we check in with them monthly and we had, since they opened in January, we do these monthly calls so that we just, just to check in to see if they're on task, if there's anything, guidance they may need from us.

02:34:17.815 --> 02:34:19.096
We'll continue to do that.

02:34:19.576 --> 02:34:27.880
We would, from this point forward, continue to check in with them monthly, find out what status they may, where, if they've made any progress on checking in with the district.

02:34:27.940 --> 02:34:30.601
Are they going the private, private facility route?

02:34:30.962 --> 02:34:33.383
So we check in with them monthly to see where they are.

02:34:33.903 --> 02:34:39.147
And then we will continue to provide any guidance that we see fit at that point.

02:34:39.267 --> 02:34:41.269
And that would include fiscal as well.

02:34:41.309 --> 02:34:43.650
We'll continue to check in with them on a monthly basis.

02:34:44.131 --> 02:34:50.055
So, as we see whether they're progressing or not, they'll have until September 30th to open.

02:34:50.315 --> 02:35:00.563
If we start to see that there are concerns again about the facility, we will engage with them again and work with state board staff on, you know, how best we can help them.

02:35:01.844 --> 02:35:01.944
So.

02:35:04.315 --> 02:35:05.176
Board member comments?

02:35:06.336 --> 02:35:07.177
Board member Burr.

02:35:08.838 --> 02:35:24.326
I don't know if this is for you Lisa or for Deputy Superintendent McMahon, but I was intrigued in the earlier conversation on our other item about the possibility of transportation being provided by the district, but I didn't hear that conversation in this item.

02:35:25.487 --> 02:35:27.268
Was that part of the conversation?

02:35:35.785 --> 02:35:39.586
And I guess as you're coming up, could it be part of the conversation going forward?

02:35:40.666 --> 02:35:45.027
So again, we're representatives of the public education system.

02:35:45.267 --> 02:35:49.227
Any service the district offers is available to anyone using the facilities.

02:35:49.888 --> 02:35:53.688
We never had the conversation because immediately it was we need a facility downtown.

02:35:54.428 --> 02:35:56.929
And we kept trying to say we have available facilities.

02:35:56.969 --> 02:35:59.789
Let's look at the possibility of making it work there.

02:36:00.470 --> 02:36:02.870
In all honesty, there just was not authentic dialogue.

02:36:03.260 --> 02:36:04.423
It was downtown or nothing.

02:36:05.125 --> 02:36:10.299
And we kept saying, I would agree that the laws are not written.

02:36:11.932 --> 02:36:14.054
either clearly or in a way that's efficient.

02:36:14.734 --> 02:36:18.518
We don't feel as a school district we can move facilities when we have them available.

02:36:19.378 --> 02:36:24.463
I mean, imagine the taxpayers having ten times the number of schools necessary.

02:36:25.203 --> 02:36:26.965
That's just not what they're investing in.

02:36:27.045 --> 02:36:30.267
Eighty percent of the people who pay taxes in our boundaries do not have kids in the school.

02:36:30.828 --> 02:36:32.869
They do not want to pay taxes for idle facilities.

02:36:33.610 --> 02:36:40.952
So we felt like if the request is for 20,000 square feet, TK to 8, and we have that ready to go, that was the offer.

02:36:41.352 --> 02:36:43.253
Transportation to that facility is available.

02:36:44.373 --> 02:36:45.414
It's a reverse commute.

02:36:46.354 --> 02:36:47.294
You could talk to many.

02:36:47.314 --> 02:36:50.595
We're a 19-mile long school district that's very narrow.

02:36:51.415 --> 02:36:57.817
We have families go from downtown to Castellero Middle School because they want to participate in the Visual Performing Arts program.

02:36:57.857 --> 02:36:59.118
We provide transportation.

02:36:59.138 --> 02:37:00.338
Many of the families do it themselves.

02:37:00.938 --> 02:37:02.839
Anything the school district does is an option.

02:37:03.968 --> 02:37:05.209
don't want to mislead anybody.

02:37:05.289 --> 02:37:06.370
It's all costly.

02:37:07.191 --> 02:37:10.013
I mean, serving meals is costly in San Jose.

02:37:10.293 --> 02:37:28.147
Everything you do in San Jose is expensive, but it's all available and running the business side of it, if we had a charter school contract for four more bus routes, as good for San Jose Unified, hopefully we can find the bus drivers, but we are open to any service the district provides with anyone using the facilities.

02:37:29.147 --> 02:37:38.452
So I would just hope that in the upcoming conversations that that issue is addressed in a collaborative way on both sides of the conversation.

02:37:41.134 --> 02:37:42.294
Okay.

02:37:45.776 --> 02:37:51.459
Yeah.

02:37:52.140 --> 02:37:52.980
We have a motion.

02:37:54.446 --> 02:37:55.086
No, I'm sorry.

02:37:55.146 --> 02:37:56.147
I did not make a motion.

02:37:56.367 --> 02:37:56.707
Go ahead.

02:37:56.827 --> 02:37:59.549
Yeah, because I thought there would be plenty of conversation.

02:37:59.589 --> 02:38:02.310
So anyway, I would move the CD recommendation.

02:38:05.652 --> 02:38:06.052
Okay.

02:38:06.192 --> 02:38:07.052
Clerk will call the roll.

02:38:10.034 --> 02:38:10.334
Okay.

02:38:11.355 --> 02:38:11.815
Patricia.

02:38:11.835 --> 02:38:13.676
No.

02:38:13.696 --> 02:38:14.036
Karen.

02:38:14.056 --> 02:38:14.116
No.

02:38:15.417 --> 02:38:15.917
Feliza.

02:38:15.937 --> 02:38:17.217
Yes.

02:38:17.237 --> 02:38:17.398
Sue.

02:38:17.418 --> 02:38:17.478
Yes.

02:38:18.378 --> 02:38:18.678
Eileen.

02:38:18.698 --> 02:38:18.758
Yes.

02:38:19.579 --> 02:38:19.819
Mike.

02:38:20.139 --> 02:38:20.359
Yes.

02:38:21.059 --> 02:38:21.320
Ting.

02:38:21.340 --> 02:38:21.400
Yes.

02:38:22.500 --> 02:38:22.840
Trish.

02:38:23.881 --> 02:38:23.961
Yes.

02:38:25.592 --> 02:38:25.892
Hema?

02:38:27.393 --> 02:38:28.213
Okay, and Bruce?

02:38:29.613 --> 02:38:30.974
Okay, the motion carries.

02:38:31.794 --> 02:38:35.375
We need to break for about five minutes or so.

02:38:35.435 --> 02:38:39.537
We'll have a longer break for the lunch to set up a PowerPoint.

02:38:39.717 --> 02:38:41.538
So we'll come back at 20 of 12.

02:38:41.698 --> 02:38:47.840
Okay, the board will reconvene.

02:38:50.472 --> 02:38:52.073
I haven't signed it yet.

02:38:53.234 --> 02:39:00.619
We're now ready for item 17, the rocket ship, San Pablo Elementary.

02:39:01.479 --> 02:39:04.842
And Lisa Constanzo is here to present for the department.

02:39:04.862 --> 02:39:14.188
Item number 17 is the rocket ship.

02:39:21.984 --> 02:39:22.265
Hello?

02:39:22.845 --> 02:39:23.546
Yeah, go ahead.

02:39:23.586 --> 02:39:23.806
Better?

02:39:24.206 --> 02:39:24.506
Okay.

02:39:24.586 --> 02:39:25.487
I just wasn't close enough.

02:39:25.507 --> 02:39:25.607
Okay.

02:39:26.748 --> 02:39:27.029
All right.

02:39:27.069 --> 02:39:27.809
The timeline.

02:39:28.230 --> 02:39:35.276
November 15, 2017, the West Contra Costa Unified School District voted to deny the petition by a vote of 3 to 2.

02:39:35.976 --> 02:39:42.542
On May 25, 2018, Contra Costa County Office of Education voted to deny the petition by a vote of 3 to 2.

02:39:43.242 --> 02:39:46.886
And the petitioner submitted a petition on appeal to the state board on May 29, 2018.

02:39:50.322 --> 02:40:00.909
The CDE recommendation is that the State Board hold a public hearing to deny the request to establish Rocketship San Pablo, a TK to grade five charter school under the oversight of the State Board.

02:40:01.590 --> 02:40:17.121
The recommendation is based on the following findings, demonstratively unlikely to successfully implement the program, we are concerned about an over-reliance on startup loans, and past history of State Board authorized school and currently authorized Rocketship Futuro Academy.

02:40:19.531 --> 02:40:26.596
I added this slide just because I know we've been talking a lot about what is required in the Education Code with each of the petitions that is before you.

02:40:27.076 --> 02:40:42.506
So with an establishment of a charter school, Education Code 47605B states that we shall not deny a petition for establishment of a charter school unless we make written findings setting forth facts to support one of the following conditions.

02:40:43.167 --> 02:40:48.891
So number one is the charter school presents an unsound educational program for pupils to be enrolled in the charter school.

02:40:49.871 --> 02:40:55.674
Number two is the petitioners are demonstratively unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition.

02:40:56.634 --> 02:41:14.482
Number three is that the petition does not contain the number of signatures required by subdivision A. The petition does not contain an affirmation of each of the petitions described in subdivision D. And number five is that the petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all of the charter elements.

02:41:14.582 --> 02:41:18.784
And those are the ones you will find in our attachment 1A with each of the items.

02:41:19.344 --> 02:41:29.892
that we go through at the ACCS meeting, but we've also included as an attachment to the board items now so that you have it readily accessible to you if you'd like to refer to it.

02:41:31.633 --> 02:41:38.778
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools met on August 14, 2018, and the Advisory Commission moved to approve the petition.

02:41:39.238 --> 02:41:40.919
The motion passed by a vote of 7 to 2.

02:41:44.434 --> 02:41:59.626
A little bit of background, Rocketship San Pablo Elementary is proposing to open for the 19-20 school year to enroll 386 pupils in grades TK to 5, and they plan to grow to 600 pupils by 2023-24.

02:42:00.787 --> 02:42:11.555
They plan to locate in close proximity to community colleges and public transportation central to serve the families of the Iron Triangle in San Pablo and Central Richmond.

02:42:14.344 --> 02:42:20.347
Rocketship's mission is to eliminate the achievement gap by graduating all students at or above grade level.

02:42:21.027 --> 02:42:28.090
Their model is built on three foundational pillars, teachers and leadership, Rocketeer students, and parents.

02:42:29.470 --> 02:42:33.192
And the petitioners here, I'm sure they'll speak more to their model.

02:42:34.793 --> 02:42:39.155
The CD findings, so we have made a finding in terms of the ability to implement.

02:42:39.415 --> 02:42:43.476
The initial review multi-year financial plan was not fiscally viable.

02:42:44.217 --> 02:42:48.038
Negative fund balances and there are no reserves for the first three fiscal years.

02:42:48.678 --> 02:42:55.061
This was due to the revenues including startup loans, the intercompany loans and a charter school revolving loan.

02:42:55.481 --> 02:43:04.064
The total of those two, about a million dollars, which is one of our main concerns, is about how much startup loans are needed for the school to actually open.

02:43:06.024 --> 02:43:11.567
Continuing with our findings, right before the ACCS meeting actually, we received a revised budget.

02:43:12.587 --> 02:43:21.211
The school will be fiscally viable if it includes a grant that has been received by the federal government and also only with the inclusion of these startup loans.

02:43:22.292 --> 02:43:26.774
CDE still remains concerned about the heavy reliance on startup loans to open the school.

02:43:29.383 --> 02:43:40.291
Past history, so there has been two Rocketship schools, one currently authorized by the state board and one previously that we wanted to just bring to the board's attention.

02:43:40.792 --> 02:43:47.697
Rocketship San Francisco was approved by the board in January 11, 2012 to open the 13-14 school year.

02:43:48.578 --> 02:43:52.421
On June 3rd, they requested a material revision to delay opening until 2015.

02:43:54.322 --> 02:44:00.168
And in 2013, they wrote to CDE to withdraw the request for material revision, saying they would not be able to open.

02:44:00.929 --> 02:44:08.636
We confirmed that they understood that this decision would result in the termination of their authorization and their charter petition at that time.

02:44:08.997 --> 02:44:10.278
So that school did not open.

02:44:13.274 --> 02:44:19.518
Now this is the current school that is currently under state board authorization, Rocketship Futuro Academy.

02:44:19.698 --> 02:44:28.263
They were approved by the state board on March 10th, 2016 for a five-year term from July 1st, 2016 through June 30th, 2021.

02:44:29.363 --> 02:44:34.486
There was a material revision that was approved by the board during that first year of operation to reduce enrollment.

02:44:35.087 --> 02:44:41.490
And since their opening, we have had, CDE has sent six letters of concern to the school during the 17-18 school year.

02:44:45.074 --> 02:44:49.378
Those letters of concern have been regarding, two of them were regarding fiscal issues.

02:44:49.498 --> 02:44:53.061
One was sent in October of 2017 and another in June of this year.

02:44:53.922 --> 02:44:59.507
Concerns about English language development instruction and teacher credentialing, two letters in November and February.

02:45:00.408 --> 02:45:04.893
There was an additional letter regarding EL instruction and English learner advisory committee.

02:45:05.334 --> 02:45:07.737
And then an additional letter regarding teacher credentialing.

02:45:07.757 --> 02:45:13.583
So this is a summary of the six letters that we issued during the 17-18 school year.

02:45:14.204 --> 02:45:18.429
And I can go into more detail in those if board members have questions of those later on.

02:45:20.376 --> 02:45:27.983
The most recent letter of concern was June 13, 2018, and we highlighted the negative ending fund balances and declining enrollment at that time.

02:45:28.723 --> 02:45:38.892
And the school's response was that they would be using intercompany loans and the deferral of management fees to balance the budget and to help with the issues of cash flow.

02:45:39.573 --> 02:45:46.799
But there was no timeline specified on when these loans would need to be paid back and the deferral management fees in that response.

02:45:48.550 --> 02:45:56.034
In the August 2018 fiscal memorandum to the state board, this is our annual report that we let you know how the state board schools are doing fiscally.

02:45:57.075 --> 02:46:04.159
Rocketship Futura was in a poor financial condition, again for the same reasons, the negative ending fund balance and the no reserves.

02:46:04.579 --> 02:46:10.182
And it was based on the second interim report that we reviewed on behalf of the board at that time.

02:46:13.088 --> 02:46:32.630
We have been in communications with with Rocketship actually since right before the ACCS meeting and again yesterday To talk about these the letters of concern and and they have provided some clarification to us about these letters of concern they have they've also stated they do not expect a positive fund balance for futuro until the 1920 school year and

02:46:34.451 --> 02:46:42.193
And we have also talked about their approach to a modified or cruel approach moving forward when we look at their finances.

02:46:42.693 --> 02:47:02.837
In essence, this would mean taking out the intercompany loans and some of the management fees out of basically the budget and what would be so that it basically brings the negative fund balances down lower to a lower amount because we don't see the payment back of those loans and those management fees have been deferred out into the future.

02:47:03.918 --> 02:47:10.859
So a combination of lower than expected enrollment and again the heavy reliance on the startup loans is still an overall concern of CDEs.

02:47:13.878 --> 02:47:22.140
Also, if the school is approved by the State Board, we do have some concerns about the petition that we'll be working with the petitioner on to clarify.

02:47:22.640 --> 02:47:24.641
One of those is a plan for English learners.

02:47:25.441 --> 02:47:36.864
We have some concerns about the measurable pupil outcomes and a description of those outcomes, employee qualifications, health and safety procedures, and again, expulsion and suspension procedures.

02:47:36.924 --> 02:47:41.245
I know I keep saying those like a broken record, but those will need to be updated as well.

02:47:43.160 --> 02:48:00.049
In summary, CDE is recommending denial in terms of we have some concerns about the fiscal concerns, about the startup loans, past history of the state board authorized school and the currently authorized Futuro Academy, and we will also need clarification of the charter elements in the petition.

02:48:01.090 --> 02:48:04.672
That's the end of my presentation, but I am here and available for any questions that you may have.

02:48:04.692 --> 02:48:06.873
Okay, technical questions.

02:48:08.885 --> 02:48:11.747
Hearing none, then I think we're ready for the public hearing.

02:48:12.748 --> 02:48:14.410
So we'll open the public hearing.

02:48:14.510 --> 02:48:19.894
Each side will have 10 minutes and we'll take first the petitioners for the charter.

02:48:29.122 --> 02:48:29.322
Okay.

02:48:38.069 --> 02:48:38.870
Like me, yeah.

02:48:39.650 --> 02:48:40.731
Is this as far as it opens?

02:48:41.331 --> 02:48:41.931
Or does it open?

02:48:41.991 --> 02:48:43.112
It should open more, right?

02:48:43.132 --> 02:48:44.073
This is a PDF.

02:48:44.993 --> 02:48:45.974
Do we have the slides?

02:48:48.375 --> 02:48:53.318
Because that's just a PDF.

02:48:55.480 --> 02:48:56.600
Okay.

02:48:57.181 --> 02:48:57.801
Yeah, it does.

02:48:57.861 --> 02:48:58.261
Is that enough?

02:48:58.461 --> 02:48:59.082
Okay, all right.

02:49:14.620 --> 02:49:19.264
Good afternoon President Kirst, Vice President Strauss and distinguished members of the board.

02:49:19.744 --> 02:49:37.659
I am Marisa Gill, Bay Area Regional Director for Rocketship Public Schools and I'm proud to be here with our educators and families representing San Pablo and asking for your support to bring a high public elementary charter school to the community in West Contra Costa Unified School District.

02:49:40.885 --> 02:49:50.948
Contra Costa County is home to some of the best public schools in our state, but there are still communities across the East Bay that don't get the same opportunity to attend a great public school.

02:49:52.029 --> 02:49:54.690
This is what the achievement gap looks like in the East Bay.

02:49:55.610 --> 02:50:03.933
We see exemplars of excellence across the region, separated by pockets of crotically underperforming schools in historically low-income communities.

02:50:06.212 --> 02:50:08.554
The City of San Pablo is one of those communities.

02:50:09.415 --> 02:50:18.582
There are five public elementary schools serving San Pablo, and not one of them exceeded the state average for proficiency in math or ELA on the 2016-2017 state standards.

02:50:21.306 --> 02:50:25.787
On average, only one in five students in San Pablo elementary schools are on grade level.

02:50:27.388 --> 02:50:30.149
Over 2,000 students are enrolled in these schools.

02:50:31.149 --> 02:50:35.830
These students and families deserve the opportunity to attend a high quality public school.

02:50:36.370 --> 02:50:41.732
And that is why over 500 families signed the petition to open a rocket ship public school in San Pablo.

02:50:43.772 --> 02:50:47.717
Rocketship Public Schools is a nonprofit network of public elementary charter schools.

02:50:48.398 --> 02:50:54.326
Since our founding 12 years ago, we've opened 13 schools across the Bay Area serving over 14,000 students.

02:50:55.247 --> 02:51:00.995
The vast majority of the students we serve come from disadvantaged communities that lack access to high quality schools.

02:51:03.539 --> 02:51:12.410
As we've consistently demonstrated, Rocketship schools provide disadvantaged communities with a high-quality education that continues to grow stronger year after year.

02:51:13.351 --> 02:51:18.497
Our network has improved performance every year since the Common Core state standards were first introduced.

02:51:19.418 --> 02:51:28.486
Our students, classified as disadvantaged, have consistently outperformed all California students in math and are quickly closing the gap on ELA.

02:51:29.748 --> 02:51:33.331
This is what it looks like to narrow and eventually eliminate the achievement gap.

02:51:34.572 --> 02:51:43.040
We still have much more work to do to ensure that every Rocketeer is college and career ready, but we are proud of the extraordinary progress that our Rocketeers are making.

02:51:44.898 --> 02:51:52.409
I would now like to turn to Josh Drake, our Senior Director of Achievement, to share a bit about our model that underlines our student academic progress.

02:51:56.194 --> 02:51:56.555
Thank you.

02:51:56.955 --> 02:52:00.520
At Rocketship, we believe transformational schools are built on three pillars.

02:52:01.468 --> 02:52:08.014
One, personalized learning that tailors instruction, content, and pace to the individual needs of each student.

02:52:08.794 --> 02:52:14.619
Two, investing in and developing the talent of all team members to unleash their full potential.

02:52:15.480 --> 02:52:23.267
And three, harnessing the extraordinary power of our parents who are champions of their child's education and leaders in our schools and our communities.

02:52:25.740 --> 02:52:34.284
Unlike many elementary schools, students at Rocketship rotate between four content blocks every day, humanities, STEM, enrichment, and the learning lab.

02:52:35.045 --> 02:52:42.988
This model allows us to improve student outcomes by supporting our teachers to develop deep content expertise in either STEM or humanities.

02:52:45.610 --> 02:52:54.034
Our teachers lead the learning process for every student we serve in both whole group grade level instruction as well as differentiated instruction to meet students' individual needs.

02:52:54.884 --> 02:53:05.594
Independent learning, small group tutoring, and adaptive online learning programs augment teacher-led instruction and support students to take ownership of their learning.

02:53:06.615 --> 02:53:16.283
This carefully orchestrated combination of instructional methods is made possible by robust and regular data streams so that we can map precisely what our students' support needs are.

02:53:17.024 --> 02:53:21.248
This is how we ensure we are maximizing our teacher talent and their instructional time.

02:53:24.758 --> 02:53:30.341
We are proud to serve all students in our classrooms, including a full continuum of students with special needs.

02:53:31.001 --> 02:53:33.163
Our approach to this is through meaningful inclusion.

02:53:33.723 --> 02:53:38.125
Students with disabilities spend a majority of their school day in our general education classrooms.

02:53:38.706 --> 02:53:45.429
And our special education teachers prioritize being in those classrooms to co-teach with their general education peers.

02:53:46.250 --> 02:53:50.352
As a result, we see strong academic growth for our students with disabilities.

02:53:52.802 --> 02:53:56.627
Over 50% of our Bay Area students are classified as English learners.

02:53:57.167 --> 02:54:05.517
English learners are vibrant members of our school community, and we prioritize and celebrate their culture and language as strengths to build upon.

02:54:06.599 --> 02:54:14.648
As a result, as a network, English language learners at Rocketship have outperformed their peers in California for every year since Rocketship's been founded.

02:54:15.509 --> 02:54:24.940
And this most recent spring, we saw continued improvement for English language learners, where they increased by seven points in ELA and math proficiency.

02:54:28.610 --> 02:54:37.519
As we know, many of our students have experienced some form of trauma, witnessing violence in their communities, the loss of a parent, or racially charged threats.

02:54:38.300 --> 02:54:49.552
That's why our schools feature robust systems of support for social-emotional learning as well as positive school-wide culture to support our students and help make sure they stay in our classrooms.

02:54:50.731 --> 02:54:57.773
To that end, in the 11 years Rocketship has been teaching students, we have never expelled a single student.

02:54:58.693 --> 02:55:07.936
And in our 17-18 school year, our suspension rate was 1.4% for all students, lower than both our neighboring districts as well as the state.

02:55:08.956 --> 02:55:14.078
With that, I would love to turn it to our chief program officer, Lin Liao, to talk more about the achievement results for our students.

02:55:17.517 --> 02:55:17.777
Hello.

02:55:18.698 --> 02:55:22.342
Our mission is to eliminate the achievement gap in the communities we serve.

02:55:23.123 --> 02:55:29.090
And that's why we pay particular attention to the performance of students classified as socioeconomically disadvantaged.

02:55:29.971 --> 02:55:37.980
We are very proud that our Rocketeers significantly outperform their peers in math across every local school district where we operate.

02:55:42.082 --> 02:55:49.594
The same is true for ELA, where, as we noted earlier, our students have made remarkable gains since Common Core State Standards were first introduced.

02:55:50.376 --> 02:55:56.626
We increased the percent of our students who are proficient in ELA by 14 percentage points over the last four years.

02:56:00.376 --> 02:56:05.280
What's even more encouraging, the gains our racketeers make in elementary school extended to middle school.

02:56:06.381 --> 02:56:13.787
SRI International, an independent nonprofit research center, conducted a three-year study on the performance of our graduates in middle school.

02:56:14.628 --> 02:56:23.336
The study followed nearly 2,000 students and showed that Rocketship graduates are a year ahead of their middle school classmates in both math and reading.

02:56:24.076 --> 02:56:32.206
and continue to demonstrate the key character skills associated with long-term success, including self-efficacy, motivation, and grit.

02:56:33.988 --> 02:56:39.675
I would now like to introduce Keisha Bailey, Art Chief Financial Officer, to highlight a few aspects of our financial model.

02:56:45.748 --> 02:56:49.009
Financial sustainability is a core tenet of the Rocketship model.

02:56:49.669 --> 02:56:52.930
On average, our schools break even in three to five years.

02:56:53.791 --> 02:57:01.913
Our projections for our San Pablo campus put us on track to break even in year three with healthy cash reserves in every year of operation.

02:57:03.354 --> 02:57:15.278
As is typical with large established nonprofit school networks like Rocketship, our national network provides financial support in the startup years as our new school grows enrollment and reaches full sustainability.

02:57:19.406 --> 02:57:25.188
This chart looks at the five most recent school openings in our South Bay region where we operate 10 schools.

02:57:26.109 --> 02:57:35.612
As you can see, while many of our schools start with a deficit in year one, they all grow to become fully sustainable on public funding and maintain healthy cash reserves.

02:57:36.492 --> 02:57:40.634
This demonstrates the strength of our network in both starting and sustaining schools.

02:57:44.631 --> 02:57:54.341
At Rocketship Futuro Academy, our state board authorized school in Concord, we ended last fiscal year with a healthy cash reserve and are on track to break even in year four.

02:57:55.382 --> 02:58:00.667
Futuro Academy is a Prop 39 campus that was relocated in year two.

02:58:01.408 --> 02:58:08.938
Despite the challenges of our location in year one and move in year two, enrollment is continuing to increase significantly year over year.

02:58:10.039 --> 02:58:14.445
Due to our Prop 39 placement this year, we limited enrollment to 441 students, but have another 73 on the wait list.

02:58:22.349 --> 02:58:32.116
Futuro Academy has grown from a small school housed in a Prop 39 modular buildings on a dirt lot to a vibrant campus serving nearly 450 students.

02:58:32.997 --> 02:58:42.964
Our second East Bay school, Rocketship Delta Prep, just opened in its own state-of-the-art facility, the first net zero charter in the nation serving 459 students.

02:58:43.605 --> 02:58:45.986
Both schools have already a long wait list.

02:58:46.907 --> 02:58:50.830
There is a strong demand for great schools in underserved communities across the East Bay.

02:58:52.679 --> 02:58:55.101
The City of San Pablo is one of those communities.

02:58:56.162 --> 02:59:01.087
Hundreds of families have already completed intent to enroll forms for the 19-20 school year.

02:59:02.088 --> 02:59:08.514
They have seen the results of our schools across the Bay Area and rightly want the same choice for their own children.

02:59:09.555 --> 02:59:16.642
Help us build a more just and equitable future for the children of San Pablo by please approving Rocketship San Pablo.

02:59:16.903 --> 02:59:17.243
Thank you.

02:59:19.033 --> 02:59:19.754
Okay, thank you.

02:59:19.974 --> 02:59:24.459
And now we'll have 10 minutes for the opposed to the petition.

03:00:13.649 --> 03:00:19.730
Board President Kirst, Vice President Strauss and distinguished members of the board, my name is Valerie Cuevas.

03:00:19.790 --> 03:00:31.093
I currently serve in many capacities in education and today I come wearing one specific hat and that is as a public servant elected and serving as the current school board president for West Contra Costa Unified.

03:00:31.113 --> 03:00:34.674
I'm here with my colleague, Trustee Madeline Cronenberg as well.

03:00:35.394 --> 03:00:42.120
And we come before you to talk about how we are well aware that we want to give opportunities to every student to succeed.

03:00:43.041 --> 03:00:46.864
We strive to do that and it breaks our heart that the achievement gap exists.

03:00:47.685 --> 03:00:54.871
And so we want partners to come with us who can deliver the promise that they will in fact help us close the achievement gap.

03:00:55.431 --> 03:00:58.374
And every petition that comes before us amongst our board

03:00:59.014 --> 03:01:05.102
We know and are very well aware of what are the guidelines by which we can make a factual determination.

03:01:05.502 --> 03:01:09.948
Can we count on that individual petition to be a true partner with us?

03:01:10.468 --> 03:01:11.410
And we don't go beyond that.

03:01:11.590 --> 03:01:14.013
The state is very clear on what we should consider.

03:01:15.314 --> 03:01:22.320
as your staff recommended that there are very specific reasons with which you can deny a petition and nothing else.

03:01:23.121 --> 03:01:30.747
And for us, we have many times as a board approved charters that are able to demonstrate that they can be that partner.

03:01:31.728 --> 03:01:39.435
And unfortunately we come in this instance to say the facts demonstrate a pattern to us that this is not a partner that we can count on.

03:01:40.215 --> 03:01:43.777
And the reason that we have those findings will be presented by our district staff.

03:01:44.377 --> 03:01:46.738
We didn't manufacture this evidence.

03:01:47.599 --> 03:01:49.099
It just surfaced on its own.

03:01:49.760 --> 03:01:51.601
And in fact you all provided much of it.

03:01:52.881 --> 03:02:03.626
So we're going to ask you to please hear what our staff has to say and then we ask and wait to see what you think about your determination on what your facts say on whether this will be a good partner for us.

03:02:04.126 --> 03:02:07.368
Thank you for your time and we appreciate your humble consideration.

03:02:13.257 --> 03:02:14.178
Good afternoon.

03:02:14.618 --> 03:02:20.664
My name is Dr. Linda Delgado and I am here to represent the West Contra Costa Unified staff.

03:02:22.086 --> 03:02:24.408
I appreciate this opportunity to address you.

03:02:25.429 --> 03:02:29.093
We are here to talk today about the rocket ship petition.

03:02:30.374 --> 03:02:34.558
This is briefly the timeline which I think my colleague has amply covered.

03:02:36.199 --> 03:02:47.663
Before I go too much further, I would like to say that as the president of our board mentioned, we do have a robust charter school community in our district.

03:02:48.203 --> 03:02:59.287
We have 10 district-sponsored schools, four county-sponsored schools, and at this point we're serving approximately 5,500 students in our charter schools.

03:03:00.827 --> 03:03:04.671
The reasons for West Contra Costa denial are these two.

03:03:05.151 --> 03:03:13.137
And as we go through this overview, I will give you the rationale and the evidence to support these two claims.

03:03:19.523 --> 03:03:19.843
Here we go.

03:03:21.391 --> 03:03:22.192
I am a Luddite.

03:03:22.252 --> 03:03:23.473
These things terrify me.

03:03:24.874 --> 03:03:36.304
Of the 12 approved petitions, Rocketship has failed to open 30%, raising concerns about preparation and the speed of their growth.

03:03:37.085 --> 03:03:51.261
There is a lengthy multiple step process for special education that was of high concern for our special education staff because we are worried that this would slow service to students that need special ed support.

03:03:52.502 --> 03:03:55.304
We were concerned about measurable student outcomes.

03:03:55.545 --> 03:04:08.654
Most current Rocketship schools were not able to meet school-wide and subgroup state targets, and nearly all Rocketship schools show significant achievement gaps between their own dominant ethnic subgroups.

03:04:12.932 --> 03:04:22.801
This chart shows SBAC scores for nine Rocketship schools in the Bay Area, and it measures student achievement for at or above grade level.

03:04:23.662 --> 03:04:28.807
ELA is the column on the left, the chart on the left, and math is on the right.

03:04:29.648 --> 03:04:34.933
Orange and blue bars represent the two dominant demographics at Rocketship schools.

03:04:36.738 --> 03:04:39.779
Of these, Rocketship schools have large gaps.

03:04:39.959 --> 03:04:49.422
For example, Rocketship Mosaic, where the achievement gap is more than double, 33 percent in one ethnic group and 85 in another.

03:04:50.642 --> 03:04:57.124
In all but one Rocketship school, there were too few of African-American students to report data.

03:04:57.224 --> 03:04:59.465
That was also a high concern for our board.

03:05:01.815 --> 03:05:10.878
Now to take a different tact at looking at the data, we wanted to look at who was being served in the rocket ship schools.

03:05:10.998 --> 03:05:21.702
So we looked at the various data of the four districts that have rocket ship schools and we honed in on Alum Rock in particular.

03:05:21.762 --> 03:05:23.203
There were two reasons for this.

03:05:24.023 --> 03:05:26.925
One, they have similar demographics to our district.

03:05:27.125 --> 03:05:31.967
And two, they have similar demographics.

03:05:33.988 --> 03:05:35.149
What's my second reason?

03:05:35.449 --> 03:05:36.809
Oh, a good sample size.

03:05:36.829 --> 03:05:39.391
There are four rocket ship schools in that district.

03:05:39.831 --> 03:05:46.414
So in these two charts, you begin to see a picture of who is currently attending the rocket ship schools.

03:05:46.854 --> 03:05:49.976
On the left, you have socioeconomically disadvantaged.

03:05:50.476 --> 03:05:59.643
The gray or blue bars are the rocket ship schools and the orange bars are all of the other schools in Alum Rock that serve elementary students.

03:06:00.263 --> 03:06:07.229
As you see for socially disadvantaged, Alum Rock is clustered toward the left or low end of provision.

03:06:07.949 --> 03:06:16.776
Special education most decidedly serving fewer students than the typical Alum Rock schools, again, clustered on the left-hand side.

03:06:18.191 --> 03:06:26.716
Here we have migrant students, not a concern necessarily in our district, but again trying to get a picture of who are in, who are the students in Rocketship schools.

03:06:27.977 --> 03:06:31.459
None of the Rocketship schools have migrant students.

03:06:32.179 --> 03:06:42.505
And in English language learners, we totally acknowledge that there is about equal provision in Alum Rock between the traditional public schools and Rocketship.

03:06:47.199 --> 03:06:54.757
So our reasons focused on demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement, and I'm continuing that trend here.

03:06:57.566 --> 03:06:58.386
Using glasses.

03:06:59.087 --> 03:06:59.427
OK.

03:06:59.527 --> 03:07:04.849
The district staff were concerned about the cash flow as were our colleagues here at the state level.

03:07:05.829 --> 03:07:21.896
We were concerned about possible failure to secure funding from the sources stated in the budget and on whether or not the 15 percent fee due to each rocket ship school from to the central office would actually benefit the students of our area.

03:07:23.156 --> 03:07:32.007
The rocket ship staff have been consistently pleasant to work with, but concerns did arise focusing on transparency and bond issues.

03:07:32.488 --> 03:07:38.395
When asked for more information on this issue, rocket ship responded that they had no such documents.

03:07:39.056 --> 03:07:48.665
Like other charter management organizations, Rocketship is supported by a second organization, Launchpad, that handles their growing real estate portfolios.

03:07:49.326 --> 03:07:57.333
Rocketship did not offer guidance or seek to provide the documents that would have answered our concerns and questions on the bond.

03:07:58.714 --> 03:08:06.916
Finally, Rocketship's grade spans offer a poor fit with the district, and their anticipated enrollment shows concerning patterns in attrition.

03:08:07.756 --> 03:08:16.418
The grade span runs through fifth grade, forcing students to transfer twice, first to a neighborhood elementary school, and finally to a middle school.

03:08:17.138 --> 03:08:25.160
Rocketship staff have suggested that students will simply transfer to another charter school, and that's an option I'm going to discuss shortly.

03:08:27.802 --> 03:08:32.847
This is the anticipated enrollment that was supplied to us from the Rocketship staff.

03:08:33.367 --> 03:08:40.994
If you'll note that first grade in 2019 begins with 56 students over the course of time drops down to 30 students.

03:08:42.635 --> 03:08:45.378
This is puzzling and concerning to our district.

03:08:45.538 --> 03:08:50.863
It illuminates or suggests some sort of issue, perhaps, within the school.

03:08:50.943 --> 03:08:53.365
We won't speculate as to what that might be.

03:08:54.706 --> 03:09:05.756
Rocketship has offered explanations of this exodus, including that the parents choose to leave for other charter schools to secure enrollment in a middle school level charter.

03:09:06.497 --> 03:09:20.442
Yet a recent inquiry from district staff has found that the charters in our district have wait lists of approximately 200 students for example making waves has 218 students on their wait list.

03:09:20.942 --> 03:09:28.705
So this is I think disingenuous to parents to suggest that there will be transfer opportunities when in fact it doesn't appear that there will.

03:09:32.796 --> 03:09:38.557
The petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of certain required elements set forth.

03:09:39.397 --> 03:09:52.599
The TK program did not identify criteria for eligible students or provide adequate descriptions of the program, such as targeted curriculum and resources or the number of instructional minutes.

03:09:53.339 --> 03:10:01.841
The EL instruction provided problems in that there appeared to be no protected time in the schedule, although that claim was made within the petition.

03:10:03.291 --> 03:10:10.795
The rotational model lacks detail and oversight explained by the assertion that it will be developed once enrollment numbers are known.

03:10:11.355 --> 03:10:19.019
The district cannot approve what it has not seen and making changes to the educational program would, of course, require a time revision.

03:10:22.540 --> 03:10:24.500
I think I'll jump over those others.

03:10:24.700 --> 03:10:25.541
Your time is up.

03:10:25.641 --> 03:10:26.161
So yes.

03:10:26.621 --> 03:10:27.061
All right.

03:10:27.081 --> 03:10:36.983
So I'll leave you with this, which is one of the signature pages for your review that may point some concerns around local enthusiasm for the school.

03:10:37.143 --> 03:10:37.843
Thank you very much.

03:10:38.184 --> 03:10:38.624
Thank you.

03:10:40.024 --> 03:10:42.805
OK, that closes that portion of the public hearing.

03:10:42.845 --> 03:10:44.385
We're now ready for public comment.

03:10:46.553 --> 03:10:49.476
With the following 20 speakers, please line up.

03:10:49.616 --> 03:11:07.496
Heather Best, Gabriella Massetti, Angela Hennessy, William McGee, Angle Galarvo, Angelina Galarvo, I'm sorry, Lavaro, Madeline Krumberg, Consuelo Lara, Anthony Caro,

03:11:08.016 --> 03:11:30.981
Francisco Ortiz, Ashley Vector-Moros, Stephanie Savarro, Maria Rendez, Deborah Bayer, Patricia Ponce, Guadalupe Calvaro, Eric Premack, Valerie Jamison, and Romel Anton.

03:11:37.830 --> 03:11:38.510
Good morning, board.

03:11:38.710 --> 03:11:39.631
My name is Heather Best.

03:11:39.671 --> 03:11:43.052
I'm the principal of Lupine Hills Elementary in West Contra Costa Unified.

03:11:43.652 --> 03:11:57.957
I'm here today simply to speak on our neighborhood public schools so that you are aware of what's happening in West Contra, the changes that have occurred in recent years, and the amazing hard work that our staff members, students, and families are putting in.

03:11:58.817 --> 03:12:04.782
We have a fairly new superintendent just a couple years in, a brand new chief academic officer this year.

03:12:05.602 --> 03:12:16.651
And through their leadership, under their leadership, we're making changes such as teachers college reading and writing projects, and much more focus on workshop and student choice and voice.

03:12:17.331 --> 03:12:33.805
At schools like mine, where nearly 20% of the students have special needs, we've made tremendous changes toward not making anyone feel separate or apart, and really embracing true inclusiveness and true diversity.

03:12:34.966 --> 03:12:45.375
Across the communities of San Pablo, we're seeing investment into that same effort, and we're asking you to support those neighborhood community schools today, please.

03:12:55.006 --> 03:12:56.847
Hello, my name is Gabrielle Micheletti.

03:12:57.167 --> 03:13:00.108
I teach first grade in the San Pablo family of schools.

03:13:00.988 --> 03:13:08.531
I am here today because I am concerned that Rocketship serves a far lower percentage of students with disabilities than actually exist in their districts.

03:13:09.131 --> 03:13:12.972
About 10% of students in WCCUSD are students with disabilities.

03:13:13.593 --> 03:13:22.216
In my personal classroom of 20 first graders, four are already diagnosed with disabilities, and in first grade, many are not yet diagnosed.

03:13:22.896 --> 03:13:28.823
Rocketship consistently has fewer than 10% of such students and denies entrance to students with disabilities.

03:13:29.424 --> 03:13:34.490
The students with disabilities Rocketship takes get suspended at extreme rates, over 25%.

03:13:35.051 --> 03:13:40.597
The students in need of extra support are instead removed from their classrooms and learning communities.

03:13:41.438 --> 03:13:50.782
These high suspension rates demonstrate that Rocketship is neither willing nor able to honestly serve the community of students with all their individual needs as they are in San Pablo.

03:13:51.322 --> 03:13:57.365
And they must not be allowed to force themselves on the San Pablo community to the detriment of the existing schools there.

03:13:57.865 --> 03:13:58.145
Thank you.

03:14:03.547 --> 03:14:08.070
Hello, my name is Consuelo Lara, and I am a retired teacher from the district.

03:14:08.790 --> 03:14:10.071
I have taught there since 1998.

03:14:10.552 --> 03:14:14.494
I also have 38 years of teaching experience.

03:14:15.175 --> 03:14:16.615
I taught English learners.

03:14:16.695 --> 03:14:21.979
I was the department chair, research teacher, coach, trainer, and also coordinate ELAC.

03:14:22.359 --> 03:14:28.123
I'm concerned about the EL program, and it's not a comprehensive description.

03:14:28.443 --> 03:14:31.125
There's not a comprehensive description of their educational program.

03:14:31.485 --> 03:14:39.811
It also does not include the process by which ELs who are reclassified as English proficient will be monitored to a minimum of four years.

03:14:39.971 --> 03:14:43.573
And I used to do that monitoring in our district.

03:14:43.593 --> 03:14:51.839
We have a rigorous English learner program to the extent that when I would go and monitor those kids who are now in regular English, they would be excelling

03:14:52.980 --> 03:14:54.581
at very high level academically.

03:14:54.961 --> 03:15:04.048
So this is a great concern of ours that the English learners are not being provided the kind of rigorous academic program that we have in our district.

03:15:04.489 --> 03:15:04.869
Thank you.

03:15:09.893 --> 03:15:10.994
I've been asked to close this.

03:15:11.014 --> 03:15:11.254
Thank you.

03:15:11.554 --> 03:15:12.035
You're welcome.

03:15:12.971 --> 03:15:13.452
Good morning.

03:15:13.792 --> 03:15:15.293
My name is Madeline Cronenberg.

03:15:15.413 --> 03:15:17.454
I serve on the West Contra Costa School Board.

03:15:17.855 --> 03:15:20.317
I've served for 12 years.

03:15:20.397 --> 03:15:23.059
During that time, I've voted on many charter schools.

03:15:23.139 --> 03:15:23.979
I voted for them.

03:15:24.039 --> 03:15:25.080
I voted against them.

03:15:25.600 --> 03:15:31.765
I voted against this one in agreement with all three staffs that have

03:15:32.165 --> 03:15:34.406
independently evaluated this petition.

03:15:34.886 --> 03:15:42.990
It's been evaluated at our, at the district level, at the county level, and at your own state level and found to be lacking.

03:15:43.330 --> 03:15:57.777
I'm just going to reiterate, it lacked in financial and operational plans, it lacked in its description of its educational plan, it lacked in measurable pupil outcomes, it lacked in employee qualifications, and in health and safety.

03:15:58.417 --> 03:16:07.647
It's been opposed by the Richmond NAACP and opposed also by Senator Skinner and others who have sent you letters.

03:16:08.088 --> 03:16:16.797
I ask you to agree with your staff the independent analysis that has been given all throughout the entire process and deny the petition.

03:16:23.032 --> 03:16:23.252
Hello.

03:16:23.753 --> 03:16:28.237
My name is Anthony Gatto, and I'm a community member here in West Contra Costa Unified.

03:16:29.438 --> 03:16:34.944
A common argument that charter schools like to use is that parents and community members should have the choice of where to send their students.

03:16:35.464 --> 03:16:37.826
Well, I'm here to tell you that we do not choose rocket ship.

03:16:38.407 --> 03:16:41.009
Democracy is a critical part of our public education system.

03:16:41.430 --> 03:16:45.053
We residents tell you, our government officials, what we'd like to see in our communities.

03:16:45.954 --> 03:16:50.798
When Rocketship submitted their petition to our school board, we showed up against them and they voted them down.

03:16:51.159 --> 03:16:56.423
When they tried to bypass our school board and appeal to the county board, we showed up again and they voted them down.

03:16:56.883 --> 03:17:08.713
Now they're here before you, the State Board of Education, and all we residents ask is that you uphold the decisions made by our local elected officials that came from us local residents and that you deny the Rocketship petition.

03:17:09.033 --> 03:17:14.157
We do not want them in our communities, we do not need them in our community, and we would like you to deny the petition.

03:17:14.438 --> 03:17:14.738
Thank you.

03:17:21.328 --> 03:17:23.054
Good afternoon, board members.

03:17:23.074 --> 03:17:27.870
My name is Francisco Ortiz, and I'm a teacher at Ford Elementary, which serves students in Richmond and San Pablo.

03:17:28.652 --> 03:17:32.473
I'm also a proud product of Dover Elementary and Middle College High School in San Pablo.

03:17:33.053 --> 03:17:36.074
When I reunited with my parents here in the US, I could not speak English.

03:17:36.595 --> 03:17:47.818
As an English learner, I was overjoyed when our board of education voted unanimously to adopt the historic EL roadmap, which values the diverse funds of knowledge our students bring to our classrooms throughout the state.

03:17:48.458 --> 03:17:56.381
As an advocate for English learners, I am here to urge you to honor our community's linguistic needs and deny Rocketship San Pablo's petition due to their record

03:17:56.801 --> 03:17:58.422
of noncompliance concerning ELs.

03:17:59.203 --> 03:18:10.953
Rocketshift received multiple letters of concern from the CDE which cite a lack of appropriate ELD instruction and the same letters cited a lack of credentialed teachers to support academic and linguistic needs.

03:18:11.694 --> 03:18:17.098
Our local and county board denied Rocketshift's petition because of a history of noncompliance and strong community opposition.

03:18:17.619 --> 03:18:24.584
Please honor the promise this board made to California's English learners through the EL roadmap and respect our community, deny Rocketshift's petition,

03:18:25.505 --> 03:18:27.149
Our English learners are counting on you.

03:18:27.349 --> 03:18:27.610
Thank you.

03:18:32.998 --> 03:18:41.942
Good afternoon my name is Ashley Verbeckmos and as a kindergarten teacher at Ford Elementary social emotional development is a huge component of our schools and our community.

03:18:42.302 --> 03:18:52.967
When researching Rocketship I found several articles on bathroom policies leading to not developmentally appropriate bathroom accidents and you know in cases infections as well.

03:18:53.407 --> 03:18:56.068
The theory behind this is to teach children to use their time wisely.

03:18:56.408 --> 03:19:02.291
Students at the primary level often begin showing regression if they are denied or taught not to respond to their basic needs.

03:19:02.931 --> 03:19:12.778
Along with this, Rocketship has been known to provide inadequate supervision, often leaving students and teachers with a 60 to 1 ratio in the learning lab and oftentimes with lack of supervision being 90 to 1.

03:19:14.497 --> 03:19:19.081
In this setting, students are unable to practice their socialization, community building, and project-based learning.

03:19:19.622 --> 03:19:25.067
Added to the fact that they are not supposed to speak during lunch and have a discipline policy for students to spend hours in silence.

03:19:25.808 --> 03:19:33.595
If this is what will be happening to our community, the social emotional needs will not be addressed and our community will lack the problem solving and communication they need to navigate our society.

03:19:34.055 --> 03:19:36.497
We are essentially setting them up for failure with this model.

03:19:36.517 --> 03:19:36.758
Time.

03:19:36.778 --> 03:19:38.319
Thank you.

03:19:44.434 --> 03:19:48.720
Good afternoon, my name is Stephanie Sequeira, and I am a parent of three children within WCCUSD.

03:19:49.221 --> 03:19:53.346
I am the current chair of our district, DLCAP, and the co-chair of our district, DLAC.

03:19:53.687 --> 03:19:58.073
I also serve on the SSC and ELAC of both of my children's school at the middle school level and elementary school level.

03:19:58.553 --> 03:20:00.836
I also work at Dover Elementary, which is in San Pablo.

03:20:01.457 --> 03:20:05.021
I believe in authentic and meaningful parental involvement and engagement.

03:20:05.582 --> 03:20:12.129
My hope is that you deny Rocketship petition because it makes it almost impossible for parents to participate in the governance of its organization.

03:20:13.010 --> 03:20:18.996
There are zero parents in the Rocketship board meetings that take place only four times a year in San Jose during the work day.

03:20:19.557 --> 03:20:32.039
And while parents can satisfy their non-mandatory 30 partnerships hours through attending hearings like this one today, Rocketship's structure does not allow for authentic stakeholder engagement in its governance.

03:20:32.619 --> 03:20:36.020
Therefore, you must deny the Rocketship petitions.

03:20:36.580 --> 03:20:37.420
¿Qué nos esconde?

03:20:37.780 --> 03:20:39.661
¿Qué creen que nuestras familias son ignorantes?

03:20:40.141 --> 03:20:47.022
We deserve the right to have the governance committee where parents can participate, especially when there is no one there to participate in their LCAPs.

03:20:47.322 --> 03:20:47.622
Thank you.

03:20:55.566 --> 03:20:55.806
Okay.

03:20:56.267 --> 03:21:01.755
Hello, my name is Guadalupe Calvario, and today I'm here because I urge you to deny the Rocketship petition.

03:21:01.875 --> 03:21:09.026
I am a West Contra Costa County parent and advocate here supporting parents and caregivers in the education sector.

03:21:09.166 --> 03:21:11.510
Over the last couple of years, it has been very troublesome.

03:21:16.685 --> 03:21:24.629
and overwhelming because of all the charters now coming into our district offering better, more innovative ways of educating our children.

03:21:25.009 --> 03:21:28.331
Innovative to me has been the way that they profit off the families and children.

03:21:28.851 --> 03:21:35.775
Now what's the need of charter schools continuing to open if the last school who petitioned to open offered greatness in high education for our children?

03:21:36.635 --> 03:21:45.863
12 charter schools later and endless promises still our children are in a place where they are equivalent to our local public schools, not in a place where they are exceeding in their education.

03:21:47.124 --> 03:21:50.066
Because as a parent you want what's best for your children is education.

03:21:50.106 --> 03:21:55.831
If that means losing your dignity, then you're robbing your child of their childhood and yourself as a person.

03:21:56.531 --> 03:21:57.012
You have been

03:21:59.172 --> 03:22:03.953
You are here to decide whether we open a rocket ship or not.

03:22:04.734 --> 03:22:09.455
And if our community is here deciding and it has been decided, why are we still here?

03:22:09.555 --> 03:22:10.415
Thank you very much.

03:22:17.436 --> 03:22:19.357
So I will be translating for Ms.

03:22:19.597 --> 03:22:19.757
Ana.

03:22:20.894 --> 03:22:21.594
Muy buenas tardes.

03:22:21.614 --> 03:22:27.196
Mi nombre es Anne Enriquez y soy madre de dos niños que asisten a la Escuela Alimentaria Dover en San Pablo.

03:22:27.697 --> 03:22:32.338
Estoy aquí para dar una razón más porque no tenemos que abrir Rocketship en nuestra comunidad.

03:22:32.959 --> 03:22:39.321
Rocketship tiene una póliza de llamar la policía si los alumnos pertenecen después de una hora de la salida escolar.

03:22:39.821 --> 03:22:42.542
Rocketship asume que la familia ha tenido una emergencia.

03:22:42.862 --> 03:22:46.964
Les da derecho de llamar y entregar los niños a la autoridad o a la policía.

03:22:47.504 --> 03:22:50.885
Nuestra comunidad no necesita mas razones de tener miedo a la policia.

03:22:51.345 --> 03:23:03.229
Tenemos mas que recordar que no estamos en lugares como Mountain Diablo, San Ramon, Walnut Creek, o Antioch, sino en una comunidad familiar de color de estudiantes con familia inmigrantes.

03:23:03.669 --> 03:23:08.951
El medio de la separación de la familia y el abuso de autoridad está muy presente en nuestra comunidad.

03:23:09.451 --> 03:23:12.332
Necesitamos una comunidad unida, no con miedo.

03:23:12.612 --> 03:23:16.773
Recordemos, nuestro distrito ya ha apoyado la policia de Santuario.

03:23:17.293 --> 03:23:17.833
Good afternoon.

03:23:17.893 --> 03:23:25.897
My name is Sana Enriquez and I'm a mother of students who attend Dover Elementary in San Pablo.

03:23:36.222 --> 03:23:44.612
I am here to let you know about a policy that Rocketship has about calling police if the students are not picked up on time.

03:23:45.132 --> 03:23:48.797
Rocketship assumes that any family could not have an emergency.

03:23:51.179 --> 03:23:54.664
This gives them the right to call authorities or call the police.

03:23:55.184 --> 03:23:59.149
Our community does not need more reasons to be afraid of the police.

03:23:59.510 --> 03:24:05.898
We have to remember that we are not in places like Mount Diablo, San Ramon, Walnut Creek, or Antioch.

03:24:06.378 --> 03:24:15.544
If not, in a community where families of color, immigrant families, and the fear of separation in our families is very present.

03:24:16.045 --> 03:24:19.467
The abuse of this authority, we don't need it.

03:24:19.927 --> 03:24:25.491
Remember that we don't need, we need a community that is united and that is not afraid.

03:24:25.931 --> 03:24:30.935
Our district already adopted the policy of being a sanctuary district.

03:24:31.275 --> 03:24:35.598
What is Rocketship going to do to protect our families and our students?

03:24:36.438 --> 03:24:41.081
They're just going to be using us for their benefits or their interests.

03:24:41.401 --> 03:24:43.862
So I am here to please say no to rocketship.

03:24:47.204 --> 03:24:47.765
Good afternoon.

03:24:47.805 --> 03:24:49.266
My name is Maria Resendiz.

03:24:49.926 --> 03:24:50.726
I'm a parent.

03:24:51.727 --> 03:24:56.050
I'm a parent and resident of San Pablo in Richmond for more than 30 years.

03:24:57.730 --> 03:25:03.654
I have four students who are already college graduates who graduated from the West Contra Costa Unified School District.

03:25:05.902 --> 03:25:14.089
And I am here to please listen to what the community has already voiced through the denial of our school board and our county board.

03:25:14.649 --> 03:25:17.912
My experience with charter schools has been very personal.

03:25:18.533 --> 03:25:31.383
After my oldest attended one of their high schools for a semester on the year that they lost their accreditation, leaving my daughter with a lost year in credits and families and students left to fend for themselves.

03:25:32.344 --> 03:25:39.286
Thankfully, one of our public schools had a program where she could make up her credits and be able to graduate with her class.

03:25:40.026 --> 03:25:50.509
I would also ask you as representatives making decisions for our schools to start making decisions about limiting the number of charter schools in our local districts.

03:25:51.409 --> 03:25:57.335
It is plain logic that the more ways that the money is split, the less services for the students who need them.

03:25:57.756 --> 03:26:00.919
It is time to start making responsible financial decisions.

03:26:01.379 --> 03:26:07.425
These are impacting our children and families for generations and right now you are an instrument to this impact.

03:26:07.445 --> 03:26:08.206
Thank you very much.

03:26:09.908 --> 03:26:12.050
Will the remaining speakers please line up.

03:26:14.835 --> 03:26:39.473
Eric Premack, Valerie Jamieson, Rommel Antone, Juliet, I'm sorry, Jim Hede, Fred Farrell, Ezra Kerr, Kim Murray, Demetrio Gonzalez, Alyssa Hahn, Anna Keller, Janelle Rooley, Sonia Ramos, Era Rodriguez, Andrea LeBron,

03:26:40.905 --> 03:27:02.747
Kim Murray, Brenda Rios, Olivia Garcia, Lydia Patricio, Sylvia Anguirus, Rosa Acosta, Liz Grayson, Carlos Talari, Lorraine Richards, Steve Zelter, and Bill Delucci.

03:27:05.509 --> 03:27:07.151
Hello, my name is Patricia Ponce.

03:27:07.371 --> 03:27:08.432
I am a parent.

03:27:09.413 --> 03:27:12.317
I am a city of Sao Paulo resident for over 30 years.

03:27:12.797 --> 03:27:15.080
I am a former Lake School student.

03:27:15.200 --> 03:27:16.741
I am here representing Lake School.

03:27:17.142 --> 03:27:21.086
It is a wonderful community school and our

03:27:22.888 --> 03:27:28.191
City has adopted a resolution in 2011 to be inclusive of all of our community schools.

03:27:28.652 --> 03:27:30.293
That's a great partnership that is working.

03:27:30.313 --> 03:27:32.594
I'm also here to give a personal statement.

03:27:33.215 --> 03:27:35.536
Recently my cousin had to move to ENIAC.

03:27:35.996 --> 03:27:39.819
She went to Rocketship to request her son to be enrolled in that school.

03:27:40.299 --> 03:27:42.160
He has a special IEP service.

03:27:43.261 --> 03:27:44.702
My cousin spoke to the principal.

03:27:45.262 --> 03:27:53.647
He said that he could not accommodate her request for my nephew and was not able to enroll her student there, her son there.

03:27:54.107 --> 03:27:58.450
She couldn't be here today to give her personal testimony, but she wanted me to bring this up.

03:27:58.830 --> 03:28:00.211
So Rocketship, you lie.

03:28:00.611 --> 03:28:01.832
You lie to students.

03:28:02.132 --> 03:28:03.733
You're not inclusive.

03:28:04.053 --> 03:28:07.255
Your website says that you're totally inclusive of students.

03:28:07.676 --> 03:28:10.537
So why is my nephew so different from everybody else?

03:28:10.998 --> 03:28:13.119
This is a lie of a charter school.

03:28:13.219 --> 03:28:14.079
Please do not approve of him.

03:28:14.099 --> 03:28:14.820
Thank you very much.

03:28:19.028 --> 03:28:20.109
Hi, my name is Debbie Bayer.

03:28:20.489 --> 03:28:23.811
I am a Richmond resident and a community member.

03:28:24.371 --> 03:28:25.272
I am not a parent.

03:28:25.552 --> 03:28:26.473
I am not a teacher.

03:28:26.853 --> 03:28:29.034
But I really do care about public education.

03:28:29.515 --> 03:28:30.836
And I am a taxpayer.

03:28:31.256 --> 03:28:32.937
And I've always voted for school bonds.

03:28:33.117 --> 03:28:34.438
But I don't want to waste my money.

03:28:34.458 --> 03:28:44.664
I support the recommendation of the WCCUSD board and the county board and your own staff here to deny the petition.

03:28:45.245 --> 03:28:46.485
Rocketship has had

03:28:47.646 --> 03:28:53.715
ambitious growth plans, but it has consistently, their ambition has consistently exceeded their abilities.

03:28:54.196 --> 03:28:55.418
In 2013, it projected serving 25,000 people, 25,000 students by 2018.

03:29:03.048 --> 03:29:08.131
In 2017, last year, it projected serving 11,000 students by 2018.

03:29:09.952 --> 03:29:13.094
But this year, they're enrolling fewer than 11,000 students.

03:29:13.614 --> 03:29:19.217
It's clear that families don't want the kind of programs Rocketship is presenting.

03:29:19.617 --> 03:29:27.621
We in our district, we don't want the no excuses discipline, the high teacher turnover, and the hours of computer instruction for our children.

03:29:27.641 --> 03:29:28.722
Thank you very much.

03:29:32.895 --> 03:29:33.456
Good afternoon.

03:29:33.476 --> 03:29:35.317
Appreciative of you guys' time.

03:29:35.357 --> 03:29:36.298
My name is William McGee.

03:29:36.338 --> 03:29:39.662
I'm a principal in West Contra Costa Unified at a middle school.

03:29:40.302 --> 03:29:48.571
And so one of the things that I would ask you guys to do is just to really uphold the staff's recommendation on what they're asking you to do for the

03:29:49.371 --> 03:29:50.673
approval of this charter school.

03:29:51.474 --> 03:30:04.729
You've heard also about suspension rates, and so as a practitioner, a lot of times we get students who come back from the charter schools after the C-BEDS date, and so that is something to pay attention to when they talk about no suspensions and expulsions.

03:30:05.269 --> 03:30:08.252
And then just really understanding the local control aspect.

03:30:08.612 --> 03:30:10.094
That's what LCFF is about.

03:30:10.174 --> 03:30:13.937
That's what the state is recognizing that we should have local control.

03:30:14.377 --> 03:30:17.620
And our school board denied as well as the county denied.

03:30:17.660 --> 03:30:20.263
So I ask you guys to also consider that.

03:30:20.683 --> 03:30:24.845
And the last thing is just the opportunity gap or what's been referred to as the achievement gap.

03:30:25.225 --> 03:30:28.247
Our district has taken a lot of steps to really decrease that.

03:30:28.587 --> 03:30:34.149
And you can see that with what's happening with our student academic results, as well as people selecting our district.

03:30:34.410 --> 03:30:35.290
Thanks again for your time.

03:30:42.305 --> 03:30:43.466
Good afternoon.

03:30:44.006 --> 03:30:48.507
My name is Argentina Davila-Luevano, and I am a product of the U.S.

03:30:48.587 --> 03:30:57.211
public school systems, receiving a BSW in social work and child welfare at the University of Texas at El Paso.

03:30:57.791 --> 03:31:03.493
My career consists of having worked 25 years in nonprofits, working with families and children.

03:31:04.073 --> 03:31:09.117
including emergency response and foster placement at Department of Social Services.

03:31:09.658 --> 03:31:25.231
Today I'm wearing my civil rights hat because the landmark cases of Mendez versus Westminster and Brown versus the Board of Education have established that a child's right to a quality education is paramount.

03:31:25.971 --> 03:31:37.656
I therefore ask that our parents be given the choice and option in the schools they would like for their children to attend because it is their fundamental right.

03:31:38.216 --> 03:31:43.818
Because kids need Rocketship to expand their learning and close the achievement gap.

03:31:44.338 --> 03:31:45.939
I ask that you vote Rocketship.

03:31:46.179 --> 03:31:46.339
Time.

03:31:46.419 --> 03:31:50.461
Approving a premier educational public charter school.

03:31:50.521 --> 03:31:50.881
Thank you.

03:31:56.701 --> 03:32:08.605
Good afternoon, my name is Angel Godinez-Luevano, and I am the Executive Director for Todos Unidos, also the trustee-elect for Kiwanis for Region 9, which includes Contra Costa County.

03:32:10.966 --> 03:32:14.248
I've been a longtime civil rights advocate for over 50 years.

03:32:14.808 --> 03:32:20.450
I've marched with Dolores Huerta and taken food caravans to Cesar Chavez when he was alive.

03:32:21.350 --> 03:32:29.377
Education is the premier civil rights issue of the 21st century, and a quality education is the great equalizer.

03:32:30.118 --> 03:32:41.027
I strongly urge you to vote yes for the rocket ship petition for the children of San Pablo, that they have a choice and a better option for a quality public charter school education.

03:32:41.568 --> 03:32:47.553
When you look at what's going on there right now, with all those failing elementary schools, the grades are dismal.

03:32:47.913 --> 03:32:52.794
We need the charter school and we need Rocketship.

03:32:53.034 --> 03:32:53.914
Thank you so very much.

03:32:53.934 --> 03:33:02.736
Eric Premack, Charter Schools Development Center.

03:33:03.756 --> 03:33:15.038
We've known the Rocketship organization to run very sound schools for a long time and support the ACCS recommendation to grant this charter and hope that you will too.

03:33:15.158 --> 03:33:15.438
Thank you.

03:33:30.799 --> 03:33:32.741
Hello, my name is Valerie Jameson.

03:33:32.801 --> 03:33:41.392
I'm a proud WCCUSD alumni, active community member, and incoming Ford Elementary school parent where I also attended as a child.

03:33:41.852 --> 03:33:48.360
This school sits on the San Pablo-Richmond border and is down the street from a location Rocketship is interested in leasing.

03:33:49.021 --> 03:33:50.022
I know the community well.

03:33:50.582 --> 03:33:59.772
And I'm here to tell you that there is not enough community demand for Rocketship to be a fiscally or operationally viable organization in school in San Pablo.

03:34:00.152 --> 03:34:08.060
The handout that was distributed shows you that in Santa Clara County and other areas where Rocketship is well established, they are experiencing steep declines.

03:34:08.661 --> 03:34:13.965
At Rocketship Alma, they experienced double digit declines despite adding grade levels each year.

03:34:14.345 --> 03:34:16.607
Those schools are rejecting Rocketship and we are too.

03:34:17.128 --> 03:34:31.999
I am confident that San Pablo and West County residents as a whole, such as myself, parents will continue to choose our traditional district schools for their full service programming, established city and school partnerships, and both seasoned and qualified educators.

03:34:32.319 --> 03:34:36.823
Please vote against this petition for Rocketship in West Contra Costa Unified School District.

03:34:36.923 --> 03:34:37.223
Thank you.

03:34:43.186 --> 03:34:44.908
Hello, my name is Juliet Jamsheet.

03:34:44.928 --> 03:34:49.873
I'm a Richmond resident and a sixth grade teacher in West Contra Costa Unified.

03:34:51.354 --> 03:34:59.736
I'm here to talk about the problems at the Rocketship Mount Diablo site that was already talked about in your introduction.

03:35:01.156 --> 03:35:06.037
The State Board currently oversees Rocketship Futuro in the Mount Diablo Unified School District.

03:35:06.498 --> 03:35:20.901
When the Mount Diablo community came to the State Board two years ago, they expressed deep concern about Rocketship's finances, teacher credentialing, and English learner programs and asked you to deny the petition.

03:35:22.754 --> 03:35:24.895
It turns out these concerns were well-founded.

03:35:25.416 --> 03:35:36.283
CDE staff have sent six letters in less than two years that raised concerns about the exact same issues that the Mount Diablo community warned this board about two years ago.

03:35:37.244 --> 03:35:41.026
Please do not make the same mistake with Rocketship San Pablo.

03:35:41.146 --> 03:35:47.390
Please do not ignore the concerns of our community and the clear evidence that this petition is unlikely to succeed.

03:35:48.071 --> 03:35:52.214
Given the problems with Rocketship, I would urge you to vote against it.

03:35:52.254 --> 03:35:52.474
Thank you.

03:35:52.814 --> 03:35:53.154
Thank you.

03:35:59.038 --> 03:35:59.778
Good afternoon.

03:35:59.818 --> 03:36:07.103
My name is Kim Murray and I'd like to share a parent leader's statement expressing their feelings about Rocketship.

03:36:08.484 --> 03:36:18.090
My husband and I chose Rocketship for our youngest due to the experience he had in school and the experience our older child had in traditional district schools.

03:36:18.731 --> 03:36:22.834
We could not afford to continue to wait for our education system to improve.

03:36:23.474 --> 03:36:30.499
So we chose a school with high quality rigorous academics to prepare our daughter for college and beyond.

03:36:31.639 --> 03:36:32.360
Thank you very much.

03:36:37.150 --> 03:36:38.191
Good afternoon, board members.

03:36:38.711 --> 03:36:45.377
My name is Demetrio Gonzalez, and I'm the president of the United Teachers of Richmond, representing all five cities and close to 2,000 teachers.

03:36:46.497 --> 03:36:50.741
I'm a bilingual teacher and have worked in San Pablo schools since I began my education career.

03:36:51.421 --> 03:36:58.187
I'm presenting to you letters from elected officials in our district, the NAACP chapter in Richmond, Senator Nancy Skinner,

03:36:59.427 --> 03:37:10.650
County School Board President, Fatima Allen, and a co-written letter with school board members in our district, the mayor of San Pablo, the mayor of Osorito, and our superintendent of schools.

03:37:11.671 --> 03:37:15.071
I ask that you please stand with our community and vote no on this appeal.

03:37:16.172 --> 03:37:21.313
In our local meetings, we had over 800 community members opposing this petition.

03:37:21.893 --> 03:37:23.594
They had two parents.

03:37:24.374 --> 03:37:27.695
We do not want this school to open in our school district.

03:37:28.196 --> 03:37:30.603
and we hope that you stand with us and this community.

03:37:30.884 --> 03:37:31.165
Thank you.

03:37:35.708 --> 03:37:36.668
Hello, good afternoon.

03:37:36.769 --> 03:37:41.211
My name is Alyssa Hoy, and I am a teacher at Bayview Elementary in San Pablo, California.

03:37:41.731 --> 03:37:48.594
I'm here on behalf of Bayview staff, teachers, students, and parents to ask that you do not approve the Rocketship appeal.

03:37:49.035 --> 03:37:56.779
Rocketship does not have the support of families in San Pablo, and as an educator, I do not believe their petition will offer a high quality education to all children.

03:37:56.979 --> 03:38:05.263
From their inadequate English language instruction to their lack of support for special education students, this petition does not show the community they are truly invested in our students.

03:38:05.843 --> 03:38:11.486
The opening of Rocketship will only hurt schools like my own, disrupting and possibly dismantling existing sites.

03:38:11.946 --> 03:38:17.708
Bayview and the surrounding schools are working to provide students with a high quality education regardless of who they are and what they need.

03:38:18.249 --> 03:38:20.910
Students and families are at the heart of our work.

03:38:21.550 --> 03:38:27.673
Through Rocketship's deceptive actions with this appeal, it's clear that the success for all students is not at the center of their work.

03:38:28.133 --> 03:38:32.315
Please vote no for our families, for our communities, and most importantly, for the future of our students.

03:38:32.575 --> 03:38:32.855
Thank you.

03:38:37.349 --> 03:38:39.051
Hello, my name is Sonia Ramos.

03:38:39.131 --> 03:38:43.076
I am a bilingual school psychologist working currently at Baby Elementary in San Pablo.

03:38:43.717 --> 03:38:48.823
I am here on behalf of myself, my administration, my parents, staff, and above all, my students.

03:38:49.364 --> 03:38:56.213
As a school psychologist, I work tirelessly with a dedicated team to provide special education assessment supports to his students.

03:38:56.853 --> 03:39:07.260
At our school, we provide academic, behavior, and mental health supports on many levels, not only for myself, but we also have two community health agencies supporting the needs of our students at our school.

03:39:08.021 --> 03:39:14.145
I'm worried that the Rocketship model does not reflect or provide the individualized support for our students.

03:39:14.745 --> 03:39:22.270
As a school psychologist, I disagree with the fact that students spend so much time on computers and not with credentialed teachers like the model implies.

03:39:22.911 --> 03:39:26.293
Working in our school is a labor of passion and commitment, not business.

03:39:27.174 --> 03:39:32.805
Thank you.

03:39:33.166 --> 03:39:35.510
Lorraine Richards, California Teachers Association.

03:39:36.051 --> 03:39:37.735
California teachers strongly oppose

03:39:39.813 --> 03:39:44.256
the overturning of the decisions of the local district and county office of education.

03:39:44.896 --> 03:39:48.839
Many concerns are pointed out in the letter that CTA has given you.

03:39:49.839 --> 03:39:55.202
Most troubling is first FCMAT, which focuses on the financial points.

03:39:56.123 --> 03:40:02.107
Conflict of interest, lack of transparency, misuse of public funds, and outright fraud.

03:40:03.107 --> 03:40:13.433
Secondly, Rocketship has a very high suspension rate for African-American students and students with disability when compared with other Santa Clara County schools.

03:40:14.714 --> 03:40:27.421
Other areas that were included are qualifications of staff that are working with students, lack of comprehensive description of educational program, unclear parent involvement, and access to governing board.

03:40:27.822 --> 03:40:28.122
Thank you.

03:40:33.922 --> 03:40:34.523
Good afternoon.

03:40:34.683 --> 03:40:44.731
My name is Carlos Taboada, and I'm a retired teacher with 21 years experience in West Contra Costa USD schools as a teacher and a school counselor.

03:40:45.651 --> 03:40:57.841
And I am here to ask you to deny this petition, to deny this petition and to stand by the community, the six cities that constitute the West Contra Costa Unified School District.

03:40:58.602 --> 03:41:02.505
We do not want and we do not need yet another charter school.

03:41:04.249 --> 03:41:19.613
You already know the reasons why our school board and the county board denied their petition, because the charter was demonstrably unsuccessful to implement the program set forth in their petition.

03:41:20.773 --> 03:41:25.574
I also want to ask you to stand by participatory democracy.

03:41:27.155 --> 03:41:31.156
I'm asking you to stand by local control at the district level.

03:41:31.196 --> 03:41:31.956
Let's start there.

03:41:33.539 --> 03:41:38.224
Our authorities have already examined the issue and they voted against this petition.

03:41:38.464 --> 03:41:38.744
Time.

03:41:39.485 --> 03:41:40.166
Thank you very much.

03:41:40.186 --> 03:41:46.172
I just want to say no to rocket ship and sí a la verdadera educación pública.

03:41:46.552 --> 03:41:47.113
Muchas gracias.

03:41:52.523 --> 03:41:53.163
Good afternoon.

03:41:53.363 --> 03:41:55.905
My name is Andrea LeBron, and I'm a single mom.

03:41:56.165 --> 03:41:58.386
I was eight years old.

03:41:59.147 --> 03:42:01.888
My daughter is in Futuro Academy in Concord.

03:42:02.869 --> 03:42:09.372
And we decided to choose Rocketship because my daughter was so below in reading, was not learning.

03:42:09.392 --> 03:42:12.574
And I was worried.

03:42:13.334 --> 03:42:18.317
And I spent six months searching about Rocketship, what it's bringing to Concord community.

03:42:18.977 --> 03:42:22.621
And then I realized that was my school for my daughter.

03:42:23.282 --> 03:42:30.670
Now at third grade, now she reads level almost 11, and it's been amazing.

03:42:31.431 --> 03:42:37.498
And I decided to start advocating for the education Contra Costa and West Contra Costa as well.

03:42:38.198 --> 03:42:44.842
I've been working with the parents in San Pablo, Richmond, El Cerrito, door knocking, talking to the parent.

03:42:44.962 --> 03:42:47.664
What do you guys exactly want for your child?

03:42:48.444 --> 03:42:50.285
And they want Rocketship.

03:42:51.186 --> 03:42:55.088
So I'm here to please vote yes for Rocketship.

03:42:55.308 --> 03:42:56.349
It's for our children.

03:42:56.749 --> 03:42:59.131
It's not for money or anything else.

03:42:59.551 --> 03:43:02.573
It's just for the great education that they are bringing to us.

03:43:02.893 --> 03:43:03.213
Thank you.

03:43:12.051 --> 03:43:14.557
Just a minute, we can't hear you, so can you turn it on?

03:43:14.617 --> 03:43:14.897
Thanks.

03:43:20.765 --> 03:43:24.326
Mi nombre es Eva y soy residente de San Pablo, madre de dos niños.

03:43:25.226 --> 03:43:27.507
Mi niño estuvo en lista de espera en las escuelas Charters.

03:43:27.867 --> 03:43:29.487
Me han gustado, me han interesado.

03:43:29.647 --> 03:43:34.489
Yo solamente busco a nivel académico y me ha tocado ver que también son buenas.

03:43:35.029 --> 03:43:43.271
Solo como madre busco una oportunidad para una mejor educación también y para ayudar a algunos niños que, o madres que piensan como yo.

03:43:43.711 --> 03:43:49.473
Las escuelas todas son muy buenas, pero yo hablo a mi personal, solo busco un nivel académico que a mi me guste.

03:43:56.675 --> 03:43:57.255
Good afternoon.

03:43:57.295 --> 03:44:00.316
My name is Eva Rodriguez and I'm a resident in San Pablo.

03:44:01.516 --> 03:44:02.556
I am a mom of two children.

03:44:09.679 --> 03:44:16.624
My child is being on the waiting list of a charter in Richmond for a few years.

03:44:17.585 --> 03:44:25.271
I'm here to support Rocketship because I believe that we deserve a better education and options.

03:44:27.012 --> 03:44:34.137
And I'm here, like as a mom, I'm only looking for the better opportunity on my children's education.

03:44:34.358 --> 03:44:34.638
Thank you.

03:44:42.325 --> 03:44:50.029
Hi, my name is Olivia Garcia, and I am reading this on behalf of a Rocketship national team member.

03:44:50.849 --> 03:45:04.275
Every morning I wake up and I know that there are more children who are capable of fulfilling their dreams today than yesterday because of Rocketship schools.

03:45:05.176 --> 03:45:10.358
It is a profound responsibility to provide an excellent

03:45:10.518 --> 03:45:23.141
education to all our students, and I am proud to work alongside every single of my talented and dedicated colleagues to make this possible.

03:45:23.821 --> 03:45:24.581
Thank you very much.

03:45:30.043 --> 03:45:35.244
My name is Silvina Arguelles, and I'm reading this on behalf of the Rocketship Education Organizer.

03:45:38.110 --> 03:45:49.739
I love doing this work because there is something to be said and felt when you do work that changes other people's lives for the better, even if they are not completely aware of it.

03:45:50.420 --> 03:45:54.643
Our work impacts the lives of so many people and not just the students.

03:45:55.224 --> 03:46:03.190
And that is such an amazing feeling that even though our work can be exhausting, that feeling of helping others make it all worth it.

03:46:03.691 --> 03:46:04.871
Education organizer.

03:46:05.072 --> 03:46:05.432
Thank you.

03:46:17.004 --> 03:46:17.945
Good afternoon.

03:46:17.965 --> 03:46:19.647
My name is Lydia Patricio.

03:46:20.208 --> 03:46:25.954
I am here at the request of Rocketship to give you the opportunity to open the school.

03:46:25.974 --> 03:46:33.962
I come to recognize that as parents we have the right to ask for the education of our children to open other schools.

03:46:37.946 --> 03:46:43.449
También nosotros trabajamos, pagamos taxes y queremos el bien para nuestros hijos.

03:46:44.510 --> 03:46:47.171
Este, mejores oportunidades.

03:46:48.992 --> 03:46:57.298
Quiero pedir que voten por Rocketship porque ellos son el futuro de mañana, las siguientes generaciones.

03:46:58.498 --> 03:47:01.560
Nosotros ya vamos pasando, nuestros hijos van quedando.

03:47:02.081 --> 03:47:04.182
Denles la oportunidad de estudiar.

03:47:04.864 --> 03:47:13.088
Les pido de favor que voten por Rocketship porque ellos son la nueva generación del día de mañana.

03:47:14.889 --> 03:47:19.511
Y pues nuestros niños merecen también la oportunidad.

03:47:22.412 --> 03:47:28.275
Y este, pues, les agradecería mucho que votaran, sí, por Rocketship.

03:47:34.966 --> 03:47:38.068
Hi, my name is Patricia, and I live in San Pablo.

03:47:38.648 --> 03:47:44.071
And I am here to provide support for Rocketship so that they could open their doors.

03:47:45.412 --> 03:47:53.456
The reason I offer my support is so that my children and the children in the neighborhood could have a better access to education.

03:47:54.116 --> 03:47:56.037
Please help our community in San Pablo.

03:47:57.058 --> 03:47:59.059
Please vote in favor of Rocketship.

03:47:59.339 --> 03:48:00.099
Thank you very much.

03:48:10.632 --> 03:48:12.093
Can you get closer to the microphone?

03:48:12.153 --> 03:48:13.414
I forgot to say one more thing.

03:48:13.454 --> 03:48:16.817
Thank you for your time and for the opportunity you gave me to speak.

03:48:16.857 --> 03:48:23.182
The most important thing I recognize is the education of the children so that tomorrow they are not a burden for the government.

03:48:23.202 --> 03:48:23.482
Thank you.

03:48:34.423 --> 03:48:39.450
Our last statement is thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to come speak before you.

03:48:39.991 --> 03:48:47.160
And children are the most important thing, and she doesn't want them to be a burden on the state.

03:48:47.400 --> 03:48:47.641
Thanks.

03:48:54.349 --> 03:48:59.033
Good afternoon, my name is Liz Grayson Slater and I serve as the East Bay Regional Manager for Rocketship Public Schools.

03:48:59.273 --> 03:49:03.017
It has been a pleasure working with the San Pablo families throughout this process.

03:49:03.497 --> 03:49:17.129
We've hosted several house meetings, information sessions, literacy workshops, and even partnered with local organizations such as the San Pablo Cowboys Youth Association, Church of Christ, the New Life Movement, San Pablo Baseball Association as well.

03:49:17.969 --> 03:49:18.510
and many more.

03:49:18.530 --> 03:49:25.253
I wanted to present to you guys 28 letters that we have in support from community leaders and civic leaders throughout San Pablo.

03:49:26.033 --> 03:49:27.534
If you get a chance, please review it.

03:49:27.574 --> 03:49:41.901
There's also a letter from a West Contra Costa Unified School District alumni who is also a West Contra Costa Unified School District parent, but chose to drive 13 years to Berkeley for a better option for her child.

03:49:42.241 --> 03:49:44.202
And that included both private and charter schools.

03:49:44.283 --> 03:49:46.744
So if you guys could please review these, that would be amazing.

03:49:46.864 --> 03:49:47.124
Thank you.

03:49:54.130 --> 03:49:58.873
Board members, Ramel Antoine with the California Charter Schools Association, speaking in support of this petition.

03:49:58.893 --> 03:50:03.295
CCSA has worked deeply with this petitioner on this petition.

03:50:03.755 --> 03:50:10.298
We make sure that schools are working, connected with their communities, meeting the express needs that they're looking for.

03:50:10.839 --> 03:50:16.702
Rocketship has a very specific community that they work with, and I think that they continue to show a track record of success in the communities that they work in.

03:50:18.283 --> 03:50:30.897
I think one thing that's important to notice, so in the findings there was talk about the levels of concern about Futura Academy, specifically around finances and letters that were issued back in October.

03:50:32.018 --> 03:50:38.705
And initially the department said that Rocketship did not respond, and actually Rocketship did, and there was no response back from the department for quite a while.

03:50:39.165 --> 03:50:52.055
And there's been sort of a relationship that we've been trying to work on together to ensure that the school is working to address all the concerns that the department has and is able to continue moving forward to show the department its ability to successfully implement the program.

03:50:52.476 --> 03:50:58.460
So I hope through questioning, much more of this will start to come out so we can see that Rocketship is able to implement this program.

03:50:58.741 --> 03:50:59.021
Thank you.

03:51:08.806 --> 03:51:10.507
Hello, good afternoon, everybody.

03:51:10.908 --> 03:51:12.389
Thank you for your time.

03:51:13.430 --> 03:51:20.415
My name is Rosa Costa, and I work for the community, and also I'm president for Kiwanis Club.

03:51:22.276 --> 03:51:24.378
I'm here to support Rocketship.

03:51:26.079 --> 03:51:33.825
Please, we vote on the Rocketship San Pablo petition, and we need your help.

03:51:35.407 --> 03:51:40.033
to start to give good education to our children in San Pablo.

03:51:40.734 --> 03:51:46.381
And also, I'm here for more parents that are coming.

03:51:47.602 --> 03:51:47.883
Please.

03:51:49.580 --> 03:51:54.384
Soy la voz de muchos padres que nos apoyan.

03:51:55.445 --> 03:51:58.507
Que no pudieron venir por X razones.

03:51:59.108 --> 03:52:08.575
Trabajo o por los niños que están en la escuela o niños que están en casa porque están en una lista de espera del distrito escolar.

03:52:12.015 --> 03:52:16.177
I am the voice of many parents that are here, could not be here today.

03:52:16.217 --> 03:52:22.061
They could not be here for various reasons, for work or because they could not find childcare for their children.

03:52:43.866 --> 03:52:49.348
Children in this city are on long waiting lists that are at the district level.

03:52:50.169 --> 03:52:54.631
There is no access to school to schools at the district.

03:52:55.771 --> 03:53:07.816
Opening this school would provide an opportunity and our children would not be faced with many problems.

03:53:08.817 --> 03:53:10.877
Please vote yes for a rocket ship.

03:53:11.138 --> 03:53:11.498
Thank you.

03:53:19.471 --> 03:53:20.412
Good afternoon, board.

03:53:20.472 --> 03:53:22.295
My name is Bill Delucchi.

03:53:23.296 --> 03:53:26.340
I started my public education in San Francisco in 1950.

03:53:27.862 --> 03:53:35.992
And I've become active because in East Oakland, where I live, there are probably 15 charter schools.

03:53:36.893 --> 03:53:38.274
We just removed a principal

03:53:39.275 --> 03:53:44.177
down the street from where I live, who was appointed by OUSD.

03:53:44.237 --> 03:53:52.220
Now, OUSD has allowed the poor schools to do poorly in the neighborhoods that have a lot of non-whites.

03:53:53.441 --> 03:54:01.163
And our local schools, even though there's white people moving into Oakland, have very few of their students going to the schools because they're poor.

03:54:01.784 --> 03:54:04.805
And so the charters move in and have

03:54:06.098 --> 03:54:06.959
limited success.

03:54:08.179 --> 03:54:14.724
And so the new principal that we just got this year is going to turn our little local school around, the elementary school.

03:54:15.324 --> 03:54:19.327
And that's what we need, the public, to support the public schools.

03:54:20.127 --> 03:54:21.648
Please deny this petition.

03:54:21.888 --> 03:54:24.130
We need to keep public schools strong.

03:54:24.370 --> 03:54:24.670
Thank you.

03:54:29.929 --> 03:54:32.112
Good afternoon, Board President Kirst and board members.

03:54:32.152 --> 03:54:33.214
My name is Janelle Rooley.

03:54:33.234 --> 03:54:37.881
I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Young, Mini, and Core here today in strong support of Rocketship.

03:54:38.261 --> 03:54:42.267
And I hope that we can refocus our discussion to the actual charter petition that's at issue.

03:54:42.868 --> 03:54:45.231
In fact, that's the only thing that we get to vote on today.

03:54:46.733 --> 03:54:55.382
The law requires approval, as you know, of a charter petition as the default position, and Rocketship's charter certainly meets or exceeds those legal requirements.

03:54:55.883 --> 03:55:07.675
To address a couple of the findings, first on monitoring reclassified English learners, Rocketship does monitor student performance for four years after reclassification in accordance with both federal and state law.

03:55:08.795 --> 03:55:16.179
In order to monitor these reclassified student performance, teachers regularly review student academic data on a scheduled basis.

03:55:16.620 --> 03:55:23.803
If teachers identify a reclassified student to be struggling academically, they will determine what additional supports need to be made.

03:55:24.764 --> 03:55:33.128
In accordance with these regulations, the school also, Rockichip will also report on the number and the percentage of EL students meeting state standards.

03:55:33.509 --> 03:55:34.089
Thank you very much.

03:55:38.601 --> 03:55:39.542
My name is Steve Zeltser.

03:55:39.562 --> 03:55:41.224
I'm with Defend Public Education Now.

03:55:41.945 --> 03:55:47.271
And I urge you to reject, and we urge you to reject, this application.

03:55:48.132 --> 03:55:52.157
Rocketship has a long history of falsification, of fraud, of corruption.

03:55:52.757 --> 03:55:53.779
They've lied to the public.

03:55:53.819 --> 03:55:54.860
They've lied to the community.

03:55:55.459 --> 03:56:08.849
And unfortunately, this board, because you have been appointed by a governor who is a charter school supporter, like King's son, who runs an autonomous school and the Gulen-controlled Magnolia school chain, you people actually are working for the charters.

03:56:09.669 --> 03:56:11.891
And you should not vote on this vote.

03:56:12.051 --> 03:56:14.493
You should not have a vote on this because you're working for the charters.

03:56:15.262 --> 03:56:18.885
You actually have a vested interest with this California Charter School Association.

03:56:19.525 --> 03:56:22.387
Now, the fact of the matter is, charters are a cancer.

03:56:22.447 --> 03:56:28.031
In fact, Rocketship actually meets at the Gap Foundation, owned by John Fisher and Doris Fisher.

03:56:28.071 --> 03:56:33.775
Now, why would a charter school, a public school, meet at the foundation, the Gap Foundation?

03:56:33.955 --> 03:56:35.856
Because they're controlled by these corporations.

03:56:36.196 --> 03:56:36.957
They're a scam.

03:56:37.237 --> 03:56:41.860
These corporations don't pay taxes, and they want our money, the taxpayers' money, to pay for that.

03:56:41.900 --> 03:56:42.180
Time.

03:56:42.320 --> 03:56:43.281
I think that's outrageous.

03:56:43.341 --> 03:56:44.002
It's got to stop.

03:56:44.062 --> 03:56:44.362
Thank you.

03:56:52.694 --> 03:56:54.956
Good afternoon, my name is Easter Cowher.

03:56:55.196 --> 03:57:03.802
I am a first generation Sikh American, Harvard graduate and Columbia graduate, and perhaps most importantly today, a Rocketeer.

03:57:04.563 --> 03:57:11.368
I joined Rocketship in 2013 because I deeply believe in our mission and ability to close the achievement gap.

03:57:11.688 --> 03:57:19.094
In fact, our teachers and school leaders are working towards that very mission today as we speak by utilizing this day to teach.

03:57:19.594 --> 03:57:37.268
Since joining, I have served as Principal of Rocketship Discovery Prep, Principal of Rocketship Mateo Shidi, and today I serve as the Director of Schools for our Bay Area campuses, as well as the Director of Humanities, overseeing the creation, implementation, and coaching of our humanities model.

03:57:37.768 --> 03:57:45.274
I urge you to approve the Rocketship San Pablo petition and am available to answer any questions during the Q&A.

03:57:45.414 --> 03:57:45.694
Thank you.

03:57:49.827 --> 03:57:50.967
Good afternoon, Chairman Kearse.

03:57:51.027 --> 03:57:52.108
My name is Frederick Ferrer.

03:57:52.148 --> 03:57:53.609
I'm the chair of the board of Rocketship.

03:57:54.349 --> 03:57:58.490
I'm a 30-year faculty member at De Anza College in the area of child development.

03:57:58.951 --> 03:58:03.993
And I'm here today in support of the petition, but I'm also here to answer the questions you have about governance.

03:58:04.453 --> 03:58:10.015
I've been on the board at Rocketship for 11 years, and I've been having the honor of chairing the board for the last three.

03:58:10.035 --> 03:58:11.836
I visited all of our schools.

03:58:11.916 --> 03:58:14.657
I've met with parents, certainly faculty and principals.

03:58:15.397 --> 03:58:25.399
And so I'm really excited to hear a conversation of the questions you might have about governance or the work that we've done in professional development with our staff or with our parent engagement.

03:58:25.699 --> 03:58:34.101
I've also had the privilege of doing early professional development with our new faculty as a faculty member, being able to train our new faculty around parent engagement.

03:58:34.421 --> 03:58:35.721
And I look forward to our conversation.

03:58:35.781 --> 03:58:38.202
And I thank you for your consideration of this petition.

03:58:42.560 --> 03:58:44.522
Ona Keller with the California Teachers Association.

03:58:44.602 --> 03:58:47.366
For once, I am in agreement with one of the YMC attorneys.

03:58:47.606 --> 03:58:50.630
Let's return to the petition and to the record of this CMO.

03:58:51.531 --> 03:59:02.504
Three different staff reports have found that this petitioner is unlikely to succeed and has inadequate educational, financial, and operational programs as evidenced by a school that you currently authorize and by the testimony you've heard today.

03:59:03.164 --> 03:59:07.548
Rocketship suspended over 25% of its students with disabilities in one year at Los Sueños.

03:59:07.788 --> 03:59:12.452
Is this high enough for the board to realize that Rocketship does not have an adequate plan to serve students with disabilities?

03:59:12.933 --> 03:59:17.056
Or is this a suspension rate that is acceptable and that is worth replicating in a different school?

03:59:17.737 --> 03:59:20.339
Rocketship schools in San Jose are experiencing declining enrollment.

03:59:20.359 --> 03:59:24.262
This is where they started, this is their base, and they're not having upward enrollment.

03:59:24.623 --> 03:59:26.564
Parents don't want these schools, that's clear.

03:59:26.664 --> 03:59:28.226
Is this a school that's worth replicating?

03:59:28.906 --> 03:59:38.651
Rocketship schools in Tennessee, which serve a higher number of African-American students, ranked in the bottom 3% of all schools in Tennessee.

03:59:39.831 --> 03:59:43.173
Is this a program that serves African-American students well?

03:59:43.213 --> 03:59:44.473
I don't think the record shows that.

03:59:44.493 --> 03:59:47.535
Charters are supposed to be held to a higher standard of accountability.

03:59:48.015 --> 03:59:49.075
This charter has not met it.

03:59:49.115 --> 03:59:49.836
I urge you to deny.

03:59:49.956 --> 03:59:50.216
Thank you.

03:59:55.592 --> 03:59:58.275
That concludes the public testimony and the public hearing.

03:59:58.355 --> 04:00:02.219
So we're now ready for board member comments.

04:00:03.420 --> 04:00:05.543
Board member Cardenas, go ahead.

04:00:07.585 --> 04:00:10.087
I have some questions for the petitioners, please.

04:00:10.147 --> 04:00:11.949
Can they approach the petitioners?

04:00:17.570 --> 04:00:18.770
Thank you for your presentation.

04:00:19.211 --> 04:00:28.833
So, a big concern is like this is a really like pretty presentation, but frankly, it doesn't answer my questions when it comes to a really effective English language learner plan.

04:00:29.254 --> 04:00:38.796
And so, I would really like you to explain to me what does that entail because I haven't really gotten an effective like explanation because you are planning to enter the West Contra Costa

04:00:41.317 --> 04:00:42.018
you know, area.

04:00:42.318 --> 04:00:45.982
And in that area, I know for a fact that it's one third English language learners.

04:00:46.402 --> 04:00:49.165
And so you're expecting a lot of English language learners.

04:00:49.205 --> 04:00:51.207
So what is your plan to support them effectively?

04:00:53.349 --> 04:01:00.597
So with the time allotted here, we'll give you a brief response, but I'm going to invite our Senior Director of Achievement to answer your questions in detail.

04:01:05.293 --> 04:01:06.793
Yeah, very important question.

04:01:07.394 --> 04:01:11.575
Since Rocketship's been founded, a majority of our students have been English language learners.

04:01:11.955 --> 04:01:13.115
That was our original school.

04:01:13.735 --> 04:01:16.396
And from our founding, it was about how do we serve those students well.

04:01:17.036 --> 04:01:23.897
We've also had a partnership with Project GLAD from the very beginning, where all of our new teachers get trained and become GLAD certified.

04:01:25.478 --> 04:01:34.000
Our model for serving English language learners first starts with the ELD standards, the 2012 ELD standards, and how do we effectively address those ELD standards.

04:01:34.840 --> 04:01:39.223
And then how we do that is both through integrated instruction throughout the course of the day.

04:01:39.523 --> 04:01:46.247
How are we both addressing the Common Core State Standards for Humanities and STEM and concurrently addressing the ELD standards.

04:01:47.088 --> 04:01:51.591
And then of course we also have protected time during the day to provide designated instruction.

04:01:51.991 --> 04:01:58.275
where we focus on the ELD standards as a primary, and how do we support students' language development.

04:01:59.276 --> 04:02:04.340
But our real focus is an inclusive approach, and how do we do that into and from the content.

04:02:04.800 --> 04:02:09.824
And that's why I think we've seen the results we have, both strong language proficiency growth,

04:02:10.464 --> 04:02:22.007
but also really strong academic results where every year we've been in existence, our English language learners have consistently and significantly outperformed their peers in California.

04:02:22.467 --> 04:02:26.449
So it's about the model and it's about the execution to effectively serve our English language learners.

04:02:27.429 --> 04:02:28.329
And I have another question.

04:02:28.689 --> 04:02:36.051
So how do you plan to engage families in the process whose students are English language learners to make sure that they can be able to reclassify?

04:02:36.071 --> 04:02:38.552
Because family engagement is very important in that process.

04:02:39.093 --> 04:02:41.076
Yeah, so they're deeply involved in that process.

04:02:41.116 --> 04:02:48.806
I think also, and happy to have ESER and others talk about family engagement more broadly, because that's a core part of what we do.

04:02:49.267 --> 04:02:54.134
But they're deeply involved in the process of regular, how is your student progressing?

04:02:55.317 --> 04:03:02.042
And in addition, obviously, we have those reclassification conversations at the end of the year, and just in the same manner, they're deeply involved.

04:03:02.422 --> 04:03:21.276
And because we're constantly talking with families about how their students are progressing academically, as well as where they are in their language proficiency, those conversations aren't a one-time conversation, but an ongoing conversation throughout the year, so that they and us both understand deeply where their students are and where they need to be and how they're progressing.

04:03:23.342 --> 04:03:24.723
Go ahead if you want to speak.

04:03:25.843 --> 04:03:27.144
Yes, come on.

04:03:27.424 --> 04:03:31.046
Yeah, I can shed some additional context on the ongoing involvement.

04:03:31.106 --> 04:03:52.197
So we've got family conferences that take place and instead of just checking the box and saying that we are reclassifying students and connecting with families at the end of the year, what we really do is have a process throughout the year where we're able to sit down with families, create goals with families that are in alignment with what they would hope to see their child accomplish over the course of the year.

04:03:53.298 --> 04:04:12.791
And we also share step levels, which is the guided reading program that we use, LLI levels, and any additional supports and resources with families as a way to ensure that when we have those end-of-year conversations for reclassification, families feel really confident and can engage in that conversation and advocate for their child's needs.

04:04:14.172 --> 04:04:14.953
Board Member Strauss.

04:04:16.187 --> 04:04:19.649
I have a couple of clarifying questions for you all as a team.

04:04:20.290 --> 04:04:28.255
So I'm familiar with Rocketship over time, and I believe that your model, I have two questions, so this first one, your model may have changed.

04:04:28.655 --> 04:04:41.483
There used to be, at least I remember, a ratio where the students spent a lot of time in screen time, and then the ratio of teacher to student was higher than normal based on the original model, and I believe the model has changed.

04:04:41.503 --> 04:04:43.364
I'd just like you to clarify that for me.

04:04:46.443 --> 04:04:49.664
Sure, I can talk a little bit about what the model looks like.

04:04:50.204 --> 04:05:00.287
So students spend about approximately 60 minutes in the learning lab, and I feel like the learning lab is actually misunderstood quite often.

04:05:00.407 --> 04:05:05.349
So during this time, those 60 minutes are typically broken down into 20-minute chunks.

04:05:05.769 --> 04:05:14.214
where students have a specific online learning program that is tailored and customized to their needs and students engage in that online learning platform.

04:05:14.754 --> 04:05:17.516
And then they also then rotate into different activities.

04:05:17.656 --> 04:05:25.881
So for example, a student might engage in Lexia and then move into a step group for guided reading.

04:05:26.261 --> 04:05:30.904
with their tutor and then they would move into an enrichment activity.

04:05:30.964 --> 04:05:36.167
So either art or science or Zumba or whatever the school has elected to do.

04:05:36.908 --> 04:05:41.871
And so that way students receive a pretty comprehensive plan of support during those 60 minutes.

04:05:41.911 --> 04:05:47.354
Is that with teacher direction or support or aid or classified support?

04:05:47.974 --> 04:05:55.079
That is with our individualized learning specialists who provide the tutoring support to students during that time.

04:05:55.529 --> 04:06:07.932
And just to build off of Iser's comments, when you look at our day, our students receive more instructional minutes with certified teachers than at traditional schools because of the length of our humanities block and our STEM block.

04:06:08.432 --> 04:06:14.934
Essentially, what we've done with the learning lab is bring in the after school activities that some schools have into a regular part of our school day.

04:06:15.334 --> 04:06:20.255
And so that tutoring that a student might get after the school day or other activities that they might enjoy,

04:06:20.775 --> 04:06:23.697
We've brought that into and made a regular part of our school day.

04:06:24.098 --> 04:06:29.662
And so, students are getting the same, if not more, access to certified teachers in terms of humanities and STEM.

04:06:30.242 --> 04:06:33.625
In addition, we built the school day so they get these additional activities as well.

04:06:33.885 --> 04:06:35.326
I really appreciate the team clarifying.

04:06:35.346 --> 04:06:43.452
I have another question which we heard as part of the hearing, which is that 30% of petitions that have been approved, you've not opened those programs.

04:06:43.912 --> 04:06:45.994
That's a concern, obviously.

04:06:46.454 --> 04:06:48.015
So I'd just like some clarification.

04:06:48.055 --> 04:06:55.881
First of all, if you believe that data to be true, and if so, what's the large number of petitions where you're not opening?

04:06:55.901 --> 04:06:59.063
Yeah, so we do believe that data to be incorrect.

04:07:00.284 --> 04:07:03.727
So we have never closed a school in California.

04:07:03.747 --> 04:07:07.670
No, not opening one that was authorized to open.

04:07:08.058 --> 04:07:09.459
Oh, the San Francisco school?

04:07:10.500 --> 04:07:20.989
The statement was that you had 30% of petitions approved, at least the way I understood it, where the school was authorized open and it didn't open.

04:07:21.269 --> 04:07:24.191
Yes, so I believe that statement is incorrect, the 30%.

04:07:26.773 --> 04:07:35.801
I don't have the percentage, but I know that there was specific reference, particularly in the CD staff report, to a San Francisco school that was authorized by the state that did not open.

04:07:37.293 --> 04:07:41.314
Okay, so I think we have from Contra Costa Unified.

04:07:41.374 --> 04:07:44.255
Could you share at least your understanding of that?

04:07:44.295 --> 04:07:46.116
I'm just trying to understand this data.

04:07:46.136 --> 04:07:49.237
Is that a concern to authorize and then not open?

04:07:49.277 --> 04:07:51.397
A large number is obviously a concern.

04:07:51.978 --> 04:07:56.019
Yes, the data is available on the CDE website.

04:07:56.659 --> 04:07:59.220
Our staff did a, sorry?

04:07:59.980 --> 04:08:08.766
Yeah, our staff did a search and found that there were four charter schools authorized by Rocketship that were not opened.

04:08:10.307 --> 04:08:10.787
It's there.

04:08:11.107 --> 04:08:12.689
It's on the CDE website.

04:08:13.189 --> 04:08:14.650
Can CDE confirm this?

04:08:16.111 --> 04:08:17.472
Somebody can look it up, maybe.

04:08:19.053 --> 04:08:19.833
Maybe we could go on.

04:08:19.853 --> 04:08:21.594
All right, so that was just one of my questions.

04:08:22.235 --> 04:08:24.817
I know my other colleagues have clarifying questions.

04:08:27.258 --> 04:08:28.039
Ortiz-Lacombe.

04:08:30.803 --> 04:08:32.864
You know, it is right that it, I don't have a question.

04:08:32.884 --> 04:08:33.344
Well, I will.

04:08:33.664 --> 04:08:42.650
It is right that education is a civil rights issue of our day, and I think that maybe we're seeing it here because tempers are flaring a bit, and this is a very personal issue.

04:08:43.950 --> 04:08:46.552
But before I ask my question, I want to start with a statement.

04:08:46.932 --> 04:08:50.835
I was born in 1975 as a Mexicana, not an appointee.

04:08:51.276 --> 04:08:55.499
So I don't appreciate somebody mansplaining what my role is on this board.

04:08:55.940 --> 04:08:56.861
I'm a critical thinker.

04:08:56.881 --> 04:08:58.062
I stand by myself.

04:08:58.182 --> 04:09:02.525
And I've always have been deliberate about each of the charters that come to us.

04:09:02.906 --> 04:09:07.910
So while others may be classy enough not to react to that comment, I will not.

04:09:07.930 --> 04:09:10.252
OK, so that is my comment.

04:09:10.812 --> 04:09:12.294
Now, my question for you.

04:09:15.458 --> 04:09:27.185
I was looking at the California Data Dashboard, and while your mission is to narrow achievement gaps, I noticed that there is actually achievement gaps within your own network.

04:09:27.946 --> 04:09:39.973
I know that a lot of CMOs have aggressive strategic growth plans, and sometimes in our rush to open schools, we forget to look at the ones we already have in operation.

04:09:41.114 --> 04:09:51.542
And I think that when you show your data, it's at an aggregate, and this should not be the case, because each of your schools are actually performing at different levels.

04:09:51.842 --> 04:09:56.846
But at an aggregate, you look really good, and I do commend you on your math results.

04:09:57.566 --> 04:10:05.108
But instead of petitioning for another school, why not focus on your internal achievement gaps within your CMO?

04:10:05.448 --> 04:10:08.549
And what are you hoping to do with what you currently have?

04:10:08.609 --> 04:10:10.450
Because you also have achievement gaps.

04:10:10.750 --> 04:10:13.651
And that is the nature of growing too fast, too soon.

04:10:14.051 --> 04:10:19.693
When you have CMOs, you essentially begin to replicate some of the challenges that districts have.

04:10:19.973 --> 04:10:24.874
There is a reason why districts also struggle with narrowing achievement gaps.

04:10:24.954 --> 04:10:26.495
And now you're facing those challenges.

04:10:26.835 --> 04:10:30.876
So can you tell me what your plan is to narrow achievement gaps within your current CMO?

04:10:34.778 --> 04:10:39.999
There was a couple pieces in your question, trustee, so I will answer your first question.

04:10:41.200 --> 04:10:47.922
We have been looking at the California dashboards very closely and looking at how do we approach the achievement gap even within our own network.

04:10:48.282 --> 04:10:53.264
So for that, I do want to invite our director of programs to go more into the specifics.

04:10:53.784 --> 04:10:57.305
And then I also want to just kind of end your last question with parent demand.

04:10:58.286 --> 04:11:02.627
We have over 2,000 families that are demanding quality education in their schools.

04:11:03.047 --> 04:11:08.309
So it's not a question of rapid growth for us, but the demand is exceeding the needs of the school.

04:11:08.469 --> 04:11:10.030
But let me invite Ms.

04:11:10.090 --> 04:11:11.691
Lindley all up to answer your question fully.

04:11:12.011 --> 04:11:12.231
Okay.

04:11:12.251 --> 04:11:18.233
And then you may also want to answer why the San Francisco school didn't open if you have rapid or demand from parents.

04:11:20.700 --> 04:11:23.142
I'll answer the San Francisco school while she's getting up here.

04:11:24.082 --> 04:11:28.005
So we wanted to make sure that we did address the issue around the San Francisco school.

04:11:28.205 --> 04:11:32.709
And in short, we were not able to open that school due to location feasibilities.

04:11:33.329 --> 04:11:39.874
So we did come here in 2013, and we knew that we were not able to open the school.

04:11:40.994 --> 04:11:44.097
The staff was correct in our conversations with them.

04:11:44.877 --> 04:11:45.317
As you know,

04:11:46.278 --> 04:11:51.002
Real estate costs, fatalities is a big issue and we learned that lesson with the San Francisco school.

04:11:51.763 --> 04:11:54.665
And we want to make sure that we are able to provide schools of excellence.

04:11:54.785 --> 04:11:59.429
And if we have a charter where we're not able to provide schools of excellence, then we would not fulfill that.

04:12:00.150 --> 04:12:09.478
As to the other schools that were out alleged in that 30% rocket ship number nine, that is a school that we opted for local control.

04:12:09.638 --> 04:12:14.362
It was a school that was approved at the county level on a block of countywide petitions.

04:12:14.842 --> 04:12:23.288
and it was then withdrawn and resubmitted at the local control with Franklin-McKinley School District and is operating today and doing quite well.

04:12:25.050 --> 04:12:39.140
Rocketship 14, that was one that in addition to Rocketship 9 was submitted under that countywide petition block and we went back through to submit that through the local district

04:12:39.780 --> 04:12:43.264
Which was then denied at the local district and then was approved at the county.

04:12:43.304 --> 04:12:59.519
So Rocketship 14 opened as Rocketship 4 sub-community prep However, it was changed to Rocketship 9 in the name of the charters under that approval So the fact that the allegation that schools didn't open is incorrect.

04:13:00.100 --> 04:13:02.102
There is explanation for each one of those four and

04:13:06.654 --> 04:13:08.135
I'll start and then pass it to my colleagues too.

04:13:08.155 --> 04:13:12.799
So we agree strongly with the need to disaggregate data in a couple ways.

04:13:12.919 --> 04:13:16.723
Definitely across the range of schools in our network.

04:13:16.963 --> 04:13:24.749
So every school is unique, every grade and group of students is unique that we're really looking at what the differences of performance are.

04:13:24.809 --> 04:13:26.611
So for these purposes we did roll up

04:13:27.391 --> 04:13:28.652
To overall look at performance.

04:13:28.672 --> 04:13:42.102
So when we look at the performance of our schools across California we're looking for every single school to improve each year and Last year the majority of the schools improved there were a couple that didn't improve at the levels that we need to and then what

04:13:42.682 --> 04:13:49.385
comes into play more is the level of support we are providing those individual schools through our school support teams.

04:13:49.485 --> 04:14:03.451
So both our achievement and our director of schools teams provide coaching and guidance to the individual leaders and teachers in that school so that the following year, and even within the year, we're looking within each data cycle to make improvement so we can start improving performance.

04:14:03.831 --> 04:14:11.395
The other way you were kind of referencing the achievement gap might have been around the differences of performance between racial or ethnic groups within a school.

04:14:12.435 --> 04:14:12.976
Absolutely.

04:14:13.256 --> 04:14:20.061
So we are looking both at that for economically disadvantaged and non-economically disadvantaged students and then between racial and ethnic groups.

04:14:20.402 --> 04:14:22.283
And for that, we think about it in two ways.

04:14:22.443 --> 04:14:29.169
One is, how are students doing in each of those ethnic groups compared to the alternative school that they could go to?

04:14:29.529 --> 04:14:34.353
And in both of those cases, when I think of the chart that the West Contra Costa put up around

04:14:35.433 --> 04:14:37.254
Asian American students and Latino students.

04:14:37.354 --> 04:14:47.738
In both of those cases, both groups were far outperforming their peers in neighborhood schools and were improving faster than the state.

04:14:48.178 --> 04:14:54.000
So, we would love to see a smaller gap between those groups within our own schools.

04:14:54.100 --> 04:14:55.481
We agree with that need.

04:14:56.221 --> 04:15:03.798
That said, they were absolutely, by coming to a rocketship school, doing better than they would have done in the local alternatives.

04:15:04.078 --> 04:15:05.742
I'll turn it over to my colleagues to comment more.

04:15:08.764 --> 04:15:20.430
And on a school-based level, we have intensified, so as Lynn was speaking, we've intensified supports for campuses that show a wider gap between the different subgroups.

04:15:20.910 --> 04:15:28.434
And what that looks like is director of school support is intensified to two to three times a week where we're on the ground coaching alongside our principals.

04:15:28.774 --> 04:15:33.397
Our principals and assistant principals actually, instead of being administrators, spend about 80 to 90% of their day

04:15:34.557 --> 04:15:38.801
inside of classrooms, co-coaching, co-teaching, modeling alongside their teachers.

04:15:38.861 --> 04:15:46.407
And there's a whole host and amalgamation of resources that we provide to our teams to ensure that we are tackling those needs.

04:15:46.667 --> 04:15:59.058
In addition to that, we've also begun to work more closely and collaboratively with some other partnerships, such as GLAD, to ensure that we are tackling the needs of our ELL students.

04:15:59.918 --> 04:16:19.545
And actually, in fact, on September 24th, GLAD will be partnering with all of our schools to provide hands-on training to all of our teachers and school leaders where they will be modeling lessons, school leaders will be observing, then school leaders will be teaching, and they'll be receiving feedback, and then teachers will be teaching.

04:16:19.565 --> 04:16:26.427
And so we've got a pretty robust cycle to ensure that we're constantly keeping our eye on different subgroups so as not to leave them behind.

04:16:29.269 --> 04:16:30.810
Okay, who's next?

04:16:30.830 --> 04:16:31.210
I'm sorry, Patricia.

04:16:33.152 --> 04:16:33.972
Board member Rucker.

04:16:35.633 --> 04:16:41.157
Okay, so I have several questions for the petitioner as well.

04:16:41.177 --> 04:16:49.542
I'm going to start with the fact that, first of all, I want to thank all of the people who came here today to participate in this hearing.

04:16:49.582 --> 04:16:56.407
And anytime you make the decision to take the time to leave your home and leave your work and community to come,

04:16:56.807 --> 04:16:57.667
to these meetings.

04:16:57.768 --> 04:16:58.988
I appreciate it.

04:16:59.128 --> 04:17:06.532
It's another opportunity to meet somebody, to hear about what's going on in your communities, and to understand what's real and what's important to you.

04:17:06.552 --> 04:17:13.215
I have become accustomed in the time I've spent on the board during these particular charter school appeals

04:17:13.655 --> 04:17:17.957
that the passions are high and the issues are personal.

04:17:18.398 --> 04:17:19.658
So I'm accustomed to that.

04:17:19.678 --> 04:17:27.503
I'm also accustomed to the hyperbole that's often attached to the conversation and the presentations that are made.

04:17:27.983 --> 04:17:30.284
So I have a lot of questions and

04:17:31.605 --> 04:17:34.848
Unfortunately, I didn't communicate it with the previous charter school.

04:17:34.868 --> 04:17:41.174
When I ask you these questions, it's not so that I can point out something you did wrong and you begin by saying, I'm sorry.

04:17:41.534 --> 04:17:45.137
I'm not asking you the question so that you begin your response with, I'm sorry.

04:17:45.478 --> 04:17:47.319
So, I just want to make sure I'm clear on that.

04:17:47.960 --> 04:17:56.688
So, I heard you say in response to some earlier questions from this panel that part of the reason why you are trying to grow and trying to continue creating new charters

04:17:57.108 --> 04:17:58.629
is because of parent demand.

04:17:59.329 --> 04:18:08.253
And I'm aware that you seem to be very comfortable with the demand or support that you've gotten from many of the communities where your schools have started.

04:18:09.453 --> 04:18:11.774
That doesn't seem to be the case here today.

04:18:12.274 --> 04:18:21.378
I'm hearing an equal amount of concern as well as support as it relates to this particular charter.

04:18:23.215 --> 04:18:31.199
And you have chosen to make parents' support and demand material to the reasons why this charter should be approved.

04:18:31.739 --> 04:18:37.041
So for that reason, the opposition that we heard here today is also material.

04:18:37.421 --> 04:18:43.244
Can you explain to me what you have learned from what you heard today from this opposition?

04:18:47.898 --> 04:18:48.758
I've learned quite a bit.

04:18:48.978 --> 04:19:06.983
I've learned that this is definitely an emotional issue and that the community is very passionate about public education, community at different layers, educators, families, students, our elected officials, and we see ourselves as part of that community and we share the passion.

04:19:08.184 --> 04:19:11.626
I would disagree with all due respect on parent demand.

04:19:12.547 --> 04:19:20.953
We have nearly 500 intent to enroll forms today for families that are ready to come to the school for 2019-2020.

04:19:21.813 --> 04:19:32.081
I think looking into the audience, I do also have a lot of respect for the teachers that came here today instead of being in the schools because they are passionate about this issue.

04:19:33.121 --> 04:19:35.162
And I wish all of our families could be here as well.

04:19:35.902 --> 04:19:37.502
However, that was not the case for today.

04:19:38.322 --> 04:19:53.046
So I'm learning that issues that are important to the community, that people are passionate about, that time, energy, and commitment is definitely valuable in coming forward to either defend or speak against something that you believe in.

04:19:53.806 --> 04:19:54.066
Okay.

04:19:54.386 --> 04:19:58.710
So I have a few, I have several questions about your petition itself.

04:19:59.590 --> 04:20:08.036
As a charter management organization, you do have other charters that are in place and you do have some internal issues concerning the performance of those schools.

04:20:08.456 --> 04:20:11.799
So my question again is about your learnings.

04:20:12.319 --> 04:20:18.544
Based on the performances, and I'm going to use the word performance, not failure, so that I don't hear you say, I'm sorry.

04:20:19.244 --> 04:20:30.932
Based on the performances of those schools that are not doing as well as they should, one of the things you are charged to do is address the issue of implementing a successful academic program.

04:20:31.452 --> 04:20:46.583
What is written into this charter that is different that shows you clearly understand the issues of the performance of your other schools that you believe you can address in this program that's qualitatively different about what you wrote in the description?

04:20:49.637 --> 04:20:51.919
I believe you started the question with what have we learned.

04:20:53.019 --> 04:21:03.826
I want to know what's different in this application that addresses the concern that has been raised about the likelihood of implementing a successful academic program.

04:21:04.167 --> 04:21:10.811
That's based on the fact that you currently have some schools whose performance is not what your goals are and not what you would like to see.

04:21:11.151 --> 04:21:14.954
The reason I chose to ask it that way is at a previous hearing in July,

04:21:15.854 --> 04:21:21.317
I didn't mean to, but the CEO fell back into a corner and said she was embarrassed by the performance of her schools.

04:21:21.717 --> 04:21:24.639
I'm not asking you to admit your schools are performing badly.

04:21:25.940 --> 04:21:26.560
We know that.

04:21:26.920 --> 04:21:35.665
I want to know what are you going to, what did you do differently in this application to address what apparently happened that led to that performance?

04:21:36.513 --> 04:21:39.977
So I think overall we're very proud of the success of our Rocketeers.

04:21:40.457 --> 04:21:48.005
We do learn as we as we see areas that we can improve and I'm going to invite Mr. Josh Drake to talk specifically about those areas.

04:21:48.466 --> 04:21:50.328
I will say what's different about this petition.

04:21:51.189 --> 04:21:55.273
About two and a half years ago we had another petition come forward to this board that was approved

04:21:55.413 --> 04:21:56.914
for Rocketship Futuro.

04:21:57.254 --> 04:22:08.760
I will say the petition in front of you today has gone through vast revisions and remarkable edits, not only in our presentation of the petition, but also in the design of our program.

04:22:08.800 --> 04:22:13.342
So I'm going to let Josh Drake talk a little bit about what we've done differently to address some of those issues.

04:22:16.354 --> 04:22:19.216
I mean, it's a process of continuous improvement, and I'm happy to talk about that.

04:22:19.256 --> 04:22:20.997
But I just want to start off by clarifying.

04:22:21.798 --> 04:22:28.962
We shared, and West Contra Costa shared, our school-by-school performance, where the schools consistently outperformed their neighboring districts.

04:22:29.342 --> 04:22:35.326
And so we are not embarrassed of any of our schools, and our schools are performing well.

04:22:35.686 --> 04:22:42.611
And when you look at the combined performance of our schools, you see we consistently outperform similar schools across the state.

04:22:43.211 --> 04:22:50.534
Now with that, in our petition, it reflects the best practices we see across our schools and how do we support them on execution.

04:22:51.234 --> 04:23:00.818
Everything from the humanities curriculum, the STEM curriculum, to supporting teacher development, to supporting a range of students, whether it's students with disabilities, English language learners.

04:23:01.238 --> 04:23:03.439
How do we meet the needs of all the individual students?

04:23:03.779 --> 04:23:10.742
And I think, just as we discussed, when West Contra Costa decided to focus on two specific groups, Asian and

04:23:13.283 --> 04:23:19.749
Latino, you saw our students are outperforming their students, and that's also what we see in the South Bay.

04:23:19.809 --> 04:23:22.912
So we are not here to apologize for our schools.

04:23:22.952 --> 04:23:25.053
We are very proud of our schools and their performance.

04:23:25.714 --> 04:23:30.378
Every school has room to grow and improve because we haven't closed the achievement gap.

04:23:30.838 --> 04:23:36.924
And that's the continuing work that keeps us going day, night, and week by week, and every year.

04:23:37.745 --> 04:23:38.926
So, I just want clarity.

04:23:39.067 --> 04:23:50.944
If there's a specific school that you saw low performance, would love to hear that specific school you're concerned about, but I don't understand the basis of the conversation of low-performing schools.

04:23:51.499 --> 04:23:53.381
Okay, so that question is not going to get answered.

04:23:53.421 --> 04:23:55.002
I'll move on to my next question.

04:23:56.203 --> 04:24:02.288
The point was raised about the suspension rate, particularly for two student subgroups.

04:24:03.589 --> 04:24:05.330
Was it English learners?

04:24:05.350 --> 04:24:08.453
Students with disabilities and African-American students.

04:24:08.473 --> 04:24:11.315
I don't have all of that information.

04:24:15.098 --> 04:24:17.780
My computer has logged off again and won't let me get back on.

04:24:17.840 --> 04:24:27.508
So I'm going to ask you, could you please explain to me, in your student, I did look at your student handbook in preparation for today and I looked at all of that information.

04:24:27.548 --> 04:24:30.451
So even though your student handbook isn't actually evaluated,

04:24:30.811 --> 04:24:33.252
as part of the consideration for approving the charter.

04:24:33.672 --> 04:24:42.856
It does inform a lot of these issues about school climate and things related to this reasonable expectation about implementing an academic program.

04:24:43.716 --> 04:24:52.920
So, do you have a number of suspensions of students in those two student subgroups that seems to be higher than it is for other student subgroups?

04:24:54.218 --> 04:24:57.460
Let me talk in detail about what our suspension data is.

04:24:58.360 --> 04:25:03.422
I think in somewhat of a similar fashion, this is an anecdote versus actually comprehensive data.

04:25:03.622 --> 04:25:04.523
That's what I'm asking.

04:25:05.283 --> 04:25:10.666
So what was shared was one particular school, and we're concerned about that school and trying to help that school serve all students well.

04:25:11.564 --> 04:25:17.852
But when we look at our network-wide data, our suspension rate for all students last year was 1.4%.

04:25:19.755 --> 04:25:25.703
When we look at what was our suspension rate last year across all schools for students with disabilities, it was 4.6%.

04:25:27.665 --> 04:25:33.667
When we look across our network for our suspension rate for African-American students across our schools, it was 2.3%.

04:25:35.448 --> 04:25:39.970
So those are good results, but not good enough, right?

04:25:40.350 --> 04:25:41.571
Because there's still a difference.

04:25:41.671 --> 04:25:42.951
And so how do we work on that?

04:25:43.391 --> 04:25:45.332
I would say something else about suspension rate.

04:25:45.472 --> 04:25:46.472
It's a metric, right?

04:25:46.953 --> 04:25:49.214
And it tells you the number of students who were suspended.

04:25:49.514 --> 04:25:52.595
But it's an indicator of much more with some of what you alluded to.

04:25:53.175 --> 04:25:54.716
of how are we supporting students?

04:25:54.896 --> 04:25:56.517
How are they engaged in the classroom?

04:25:56.997 --> 04:26:02.041
What are our staff prepared to support our students and have them be successful in our classrooms?

04:26:02.481 --> 04:26:07.464
And that's where I think we've made these deep investments for multiple years as well as continue to invest.

04:26:07.484 --> 04:26:12.607
So we've done everything from training all staff on understanding behavior, the escalation cycle.

04:26:12.747 --> 04:26:16.029
How do you respond to students at different points in the escalation cycle?

04:26:16.369 --> 04:26:19.051
Trauma-informed care, how to support students with that.

04:26:19.751 --> 04:26:26.233
and making sure our teachers build deep relationships with our students because that's where it starts as well as our families.

04:26:26.633 --> 04:26:33.356
So we've made a number of investments and I think the result is what you see in our suspension rates across our schools.

04:26:33.776 --> 04:26:39.117
Okay, so you were going down the road that I was going with the academic performance of those students.

04:26:39.177 --> 04:26:43.799
Is there a significant difference in the performance of the students with disabilities at your school?

04:26:44.670 --> 04:26:46.992
There is a significant difference and we're working to close it.

04:26:47.112 --> 04:26:53.757
I think we see a difference similar to every school, unfortunately, that we see in the American education system.

04:26:54.598 --> 04:26:57.059
But what we see is our students are performing stronger.

04:26:57.119 --> 04:27:01.663
I think you saw on the deck the academic growth our students with disabilities had last year.

04:27:02.083 --> 04:27:05.386
And so we are working hard and we're seeing those students close the gap.

04:27:05.566 --> 04:27:06.627
Have they closed the gap yet?

04:27:06.947 --> 04:27:07.087
No.

04:27:07.567 --> 04:27:09.209
But are they working towards closing that gap?

04:27:09.449 --> 04:27:09.689
Yes.

04:27:09.889 --> 04:27:13.552
And in a way that we don't see in our neighboring school districts or at the state level.

04:27:13.996 --> 04:27:22.039
Is there a difference in the performance of African-Americans as a subgroup in your schools as compared with the other subgroups of students in your schools?

04:27:23.139 --> 04:27:29.581
And so that I'm not keeping a secret, I have a vested interest in how you answer that question.

04:27:31.398 --> 04:27:33.039
I'm happy to answer that question.

04:27:33.079 --> 04:27:35.519
I'll speak specifically about the California schools.

04:27:35.920 --> 04:27:50.164
So according to the independent nonprofit study put out by Innovate Public Schools, Rocketship Mateo Sheedy is the only elementary school in the Bay Area where low-income African-American students beat the state average for all students in English language arts.

04:27:51.485 --> 04:27:55.907
as called out by the 16-17 CASP results.

04:27:56.307 --> 04:27:57.428
And so I want to call that out.

04:27:57.808 --> 04:28:09.514
In our other schools, we will say that we actually don't have enough of a sample size of African-American students to be able to, for those students to be able to be reported in those reports.

04:28:09.815 --> 04:28:19.640
So Rocketship Mateo Sheedy has the largest population of African-American students and is the only elementary school who is beating the odds for that subgroup of students.

04:28:20.140 --> 04:28:20.461
Okay.

04:28:20.841 --> 04:28:23.143
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

04:28:23.704 --> 04:28:26.927
For the school that you reported, is that the school that you're the principal at?

04:28:28.008 --> 04:28:32.152
So, I actually took over as the interim principal after Jason Promolitz passed away.

04:28:32.403 --> 04:28:34.064
Were you at a different Rocketship school?

04:28:34.865 --> 04:28:39.988
Prior to taking over in the passing of Jason Fomotes, yes.

04:28:40.328 --> 04:28:56.419
Okay, so for the other Rocketship school where you at, I understand you just said that you don't have a significant subgroup size for them to be reported in the state accountability system, but you do know about the performance of the African-American students at the school where you were the administrative, the educational leader?

04:28:56.599 --> 04:28:56.799
Yes.

04:28:56.879 --> 04:28:58.060
Tell me about their performance.

04:28:58.460 --> 04:29:00.762
I can't recall every single student off the top of my head.

04:29:00.782 --> 04:29:07.587
I think we had approximately seven students, but they were on average either meeting or exceeding standards.

04:29:08.588 --> 04:29:15.973
The other thing to add that was shared earlier that was incorrect, we do have schools that have a majority of African-American students in Tennessee as well as in D.C.

04:29:16.493 --> 04:29:22.498
And in Tennessee, our school with the majority of African-American students is in the top tier of growth among schools in that state.

04:29:23.035 --> 04:29:24.756
That's nice, but I'm in California.

04:29:24.776 --> 04:29:26.176
So thank you for sharing that.

04:29:26.577 --> 04:29:28.497
I do appreciate that.

04:29:28.637 --> 04:29:34.760
The problem is I'm trying to understand what I've heard that's material to this review.

04:29:35.080 --> 04:29:45.765
When you came to us two years ago for Futuro, I was not satisfied with what you wrote, especially as it relates to the program that you were going to implement concerning English language learners.

04:29:46.105 --> 04:30:04.958
You had a question asked of you from one of my colleagues already and you didn't answer that question and I voted no against that school because you didn't have a clear academic program or concerning all of your students, particularly students of color, and you didn't clearly lay out what your program was going to be for English learners.

04:30:05.378 --> 04:30:08.881
I still see the same deficiencies in what you wrote in this description.

04:30:09.421 --> 04:30:16.747
Yes, it's better, but you still didn't address the deficiencies that were raised by me personally from your previous program.

04:30:16.967 --> 04:30:26.114
So I have a concern that you're not just replicating what you're doing well, you're continuing to replicate what you don't do well because you don't understand it.

04:30:29.717 --> 04:30:30.057
I'm done.

04:30:31.418 --> 04:30:31.679
Okay.

04:30:31.739 --> 04:30:34.621
All right, Ting Sun.

04:30:36.469 --> 04:30:43.392
First of all, member Ortiz-Lacon, thank you very much for expressing very much what was on my mind.

04:30:44.293 --> 04:30:58.699
I have faced bigotry and stereotyping all of my life, whether it's because of the way I speak, the way I look, and what I eat, and what profession I've chosen, and how I serve the children of California.

04:31:00.018 --> 04:31:10.168
So my way of combating that is to actually model open-mindedness, critical thinking, and empathy.

04:31:11.750 --> 04:31:22.340
Because, in the words of our former President Obama, if we get in the habit of bending the truth to suit political expediency or party orthodoxy, our democracy will not work.

04:31:25.265 --> 04:31:28.688
It's always a shock when you're attacked in that way.

04:31:29.709 --> 04:31:39.497
And even after all of these years, in the ripe old age of 52, to be attacked in that way still continues to shock me.

04:31:40.197 --> 04:31:45.762
But as I said, I'm very proud of what I've done, and you're not going to take that away from me.

04:31:47.843 --> 04:31:50.926
So first of all,

04:31:53.585 --> 04:31:57.166
I do have actually questions for the petitioners, please.

04:32:01.387 --> 04:32:21.393
One of the, one of my concerns is that when CMOs do expand, that they go into communities and it's not necessarily, what I want to get a better gauge of is was Rocketship invited into this community?

04:32:21.614 --> 04:32:22.894
Was this something that,

04:32:23.815 --> 04:32:26.777
Rockship said there's a need in here.

04:32:26.797 --> 04:32:38.388
I'd like to find out a little bit more about that because one of the things that has really troubled me about looking at these charter petitions is how divisive it is in these local communities.

04:32:38.808 --> 04:32:42.972
So can you tell me a little bit about your process for going into the community?

04:32:43.012 --> 04:32:44.013
Was it an invitation?

04:32:44.053 --> 04:32:45.595
Was it something you decided you want to do?

04:32:48.457 --> 04:33:05.034
And then a little bit more I know you've talked a little bit about how you've engaged community and there's interest but a little bit more about that a little bit more so the the decision to go into San Pablo was was Took us a long time years before we made the decision to move in there and even with the

04:33:06.776 --> 04:33:13.805
parents driving the demand, we still wanted to make sure that we were making the right decision and be able to bring a quality school to a community.

04:33:14.126 --> 04:33:21.655
As you know, 10 of our schools are in San Jose, we have one in Redwood City, and then our first school in Contra Costa was the Futuro School that you all authorized.

04:33:22.916 --> 04:33:24.837
So this was not a decision that was taken lightly.

04:33:25.918 --> 04:33:34.843
We looked at all of West Contra Costa County as a possibility because we had many parents from different areas, from Richmond, from San Pablo, from Hercules, El Cerrito.

04:33:35.263 --> 04:33:50.592
But what we saw with San Pablo is that it is a small community that serves like an island surrounded by other cities with the performance significantly below not only the district but also the surrounding schools.

04:33:51.813 --> 04:33:59.219
So with our families in San Jose, you could probably understand that many of them are getting priced out of housing in San Jose and go into other communities.

04:33:59.639 --> 04:34:02.762
And we do have a very robust parent advocacy program.

04:34:02.822 --> 04:34:17.695
And so parents that have been part of Rocketship that have gone to other communities have reached out to us either on social media or through our parent leaders or through educators that they have relationships with even after their child leaves Rocketship.

04:34:18.235 --> 04:34:24.920
And so San Pablo particularly came from parent demand from Rocketship parents that were already with the Rocketship school system.

04:34:25.720 --> 04:34:33.986
We did conduct three different focus groups with community members and parents to really assess what was the need and what were some of the challenges before we dove in.

04:34:34.867 --> 04:34:45.857
In addition to that, we spent three weeks going door to door in the living rooms with families having conversations before even making the decision to file the petition.

04:34:46.017 --> 04:34:49.120
Because again, we wanted to hear from families what were some of their concerns.

04:34:49.961 --> 04:34:51.583
I did many of those door knockings as well.

04:34:52.524 --> 04:34:58.730
Putting my name on a petition, I wanted to make sure that I was able to answer this question and be able to face families and say this was the right decision.

04:34:59.631 --> 04:35:13.606
And as we moved forward, as we grew in the community, working with local churches, working with local sports youth groups, to city council members in particular that have showed support, you know, this is a divisivist issue.

04:35:13.646 --> 04:35:18.191
This is definitely something that brings out the emotion in everyone, me included.

04:35:19.472 --> 04:35:22.053
But I stand by the decision that this was the right decision.

04:35:22.334 --> 04:35:26.436
And with parents driving this charter and driving this decision, I feel good about that.

04:35:26.556 --> 04:35:30.838
I feel great about the opportunity to represent them for now nearly two and a half years.

04:35:33.530 --> 04:35:34.310
It's OK.

04:35:34.991 --> 04:35:35.571
So I'm sorry.

04:35:35.611 --> 04:35:39.374
The other question I had was around the fiscal pieces, too.

04:35:39.454 --> 04:35:55.323
We heard that that there was there were other rocket ship schools that had financial issues in the documentation that the CDE provided, that there was not a response to that.

04:35:55.403 --> 04:35:58.265
But then I'm hearing that there was a response to it.

04:35:58.305 --> 04:36:01.127
Can you describe maybe this is a CDE question?

04:36:01.147 --> 04:36:01.427
I don't know.

04:36:01.587 --> 04:36:09.494
Yeah, I'll ask our Chief Financial Officer to talk a little bit about detailed finances, but I'll give you some context first on the calendaring.

04:36:10.495 --> 04:36:16.339
So, I want to start with saying that our relationship with CDE staff has grown very close.

04:36:16.900 --> 04:36:29.851
We definitely see each other as partners in ensuring that Puturo School and any other schools that are authorized, we have clear expectations, our communication is two-way and engaging, and we are working in partnership.

04:36:31.112 --> 04:36:42.503
However, when we first kind of started with the CDE staff back at the inception of Futuro, things worked a little differently.

04:36:42.523 --> 04:36:47.809
I think we can appreciate that with change in personnel comes different processes and different expectations.

04:36:48.269 --> 04:36:54.996
So the CDE staff did undergo a change in staffing from October to about February.

04:36:55.636 --> 04:36:59.958
And the first letter of concern came to us October 4th, and that was around fiscal concerns.

04:37:00.098 --> 04:37:04.240
And we did respond on October 24th and got no response back from the CDE.

04:37:05.661 --> 04:37:15.825
Inclusive, the first time we found out that we were being accused of not responding was in the the CDE staff report for a different charter petition.

04:37:15.905 --> 04:37:19.947
So I was perplexed by that, but quickly was able to resolve that with CDE.

04:37:20.347 --> 04:37:21.748
And we saw that it was an error.

04:37:21.788 --> 04:37:24.749
It was sent to three CDE staff members that did not forward it to

04:37:24.909 --> 04:37:26.229
It's the next group.

04:37:26.589 --> 04:37:34.291
So we firmly believe that any concerns in that response on October 24th of 2017 could have been resolved in a timely matter.

04:37:35.011 --> 04:37:44.033
So for example, the letter that was sent to us in June, we've been proactive and aggressive in working with the CDE staff to resolve that.

04:37:44.713 --> 04:37:49.374
And as of yesterday, we had a great meeting with the CDE and made some agreements on how to resolve that.

04:37:49.674 --> 04:37:52.135
And we were able to achieve that in three to four months.

04:37:52.595 --> 04:37:55.376
So I'm confident in our ability to continue to partner.

04:37:55.976 --> 04:38:02.218
It's unfortunate that we have this history of law of letters, but I will say that our responsiveness, I'm happy with that.

04:38:02.858 --> 04:38:16.102
And as long as we continue to have clear, concise expectations, and we are also adhering to the standards of the MOU, which ask for a response to our letters or to site visits within a certain amount of days that we can respond adequately.

04:38:17.362 --> 04:38:17.642
Thank you.

04:38:20.111 --> 04:38:20.571
Okay, Chief.

04:38:21.052 --> 04:38:24.754
Well, you were going to have, you still, that didn't address the financial question.

04:38:24.774 --> 04:38:25.854
Yes, I was just giving context.

04:38:27.155 --> 04:38:30.277
Let me amplify the financial, if I may, with a friendly amendment.

04:38:31.597 --> 04:38:43.464
There seem to be reserves in the mothership or whatever we want to call it that help with the individual charters.

04:38:44.495 --> 04:38:48.176
And that's the impression I get.

04:38:48.877 --> 04:38:56.940
But we don't have any understanding of what is in the reserves of some central, of the more central office.

04:38:56.960 --> 04:39:06.363
You're a CMO and it appears that the CMO headquarters feels responsible for helping financially.

04:39:07.223 --> 04:39:11.745
And so, but we as a board, we've heard, well, they don't have enough money.

04:39:12.654 --> 04:39:18.276
But then we don't know where the money is that is maybe coming to help you or how much it is.

04:39:19.577 --> 04:39:22.038
So can you enlighten us on that?

04:39:22.298 --> 04:39:26.280
Or do you plan to raise all the money yourself from your own charter?

04:39:27.748 --> 04:39:31.090
Sure, and I'll answer it with a number of components.

04:39:32.711 --> 04:39:35.753
First, specifically addressing the petition.

04:39:36.593 --> 04:39:42.617
I would add that our original petition was very conservative in terms of the financials that were included.

04:39:43.117 --> 04:39:50.161
For example, there are a number of supports that I want to highlight that were not included and that you should be aware of.

04:39:51.001 --> 04:40:04.325
We originally had not included, for example, our charter school grant from the Department of Education, which will provide $700,000 of support for starting up the school.

04:40:04.405 --> 04:40:09.867
And the revision that we shared this summer, we included that so that it would be more transparent and easy to understand.

04:40:10.507 --> 04:40:15.751
We also have been very pleased to have philanthropy to support the startup of our schools.

04:40:17.492 --> 04:40:29.701
We've had Silicon School support in our Futuro school, and we have also received a letter of support from Silicon Schools for the proposed San Pablo opening.

04:40:31.382 --> 04:40:35.926
They would not have board approval for that until we would actually have an approved charter.

04:40:36.666 --> 04:40:37.746
And so we did not include it.

04:40:37.806 --> 04:40:41.328
We were very conservative in the estimations that we shared.

04:40:41.528 --> 04:40:44.248
Their support has been at the $600,000 level.

04:40:44.268 --> 04:40:55.452
Just specifically with the San Pablo petition, with those items included in our first year of operation, we would have a positive fund balance.

04:40:55.532 --> 04:41:05.075
And so I want to make that clear that we would meet the requirement that the staff has clarified for us with just those additions to the financials.

04:41:05.715 --> 04:41:14.817
Coming back to your bigger question, which is the network and asking about the financial reserves and the sustainability of the network.

04:41:15.777 --> 04:41:20.498
We have finished the year with a very solid reserve network wide.

04:41:20.578 --> 04:41:23.559
I know that we're only focused on our California schools.

04:41:24.099 --> 04:41:25.699
Your question is about our network.

04:41:26.159 --> 04:41:29.120
Our network reserves are over 15%.

04:41:30.880 --> 04:41:32.742
across the network on a cash basis.

04:41:33.643 --> 04:41:45.933
We were positive network-wide in terms of our change in net assets across all of our schools, so that would be the equivalent of the fund balance question.

04:41:46.593 --> 04:41:54.380
That was positive this year across the network, so we are in a very strong position and work actively to support our schools that are being established.

04:41:55.279 --> 04:42:12.512
I just want to communicate as dynamically as I can the superintendent's strong support for the CDE staff recommendation and for the recommendations and decisions of the democratically elected boards of West Contra Costa and Contra Costa County.

04:42:13.092 --> 04:42:26.123
And a primary concern for us at the Department of Education and extension of the superintendent's recommendation is Rocketship's previous performance and particularly around Rocketship Futuro.

04:42:26.861 --> 04:42:33.363
And I've got the item open in front of me and page four starts to detail the communications.

04:42:33.783 --> 04:42:40.885
And we can debate back and forth around, you know, how those communications occurred and what had been the response or lack of response.

04:42:41.245 --> 04:42:50.408
But just the fact that CD staff have had to issue six letters of concern with numerous site visits over the last year is of concern, if nothing more.

04:42:51.349 --> 04:43:00.418
in my mind, that in the utilization of CDE staff resources, which are very precious, to be able to be engaging in this type of support.

04:43:00.999 --> 04:43:11.009
There's other issues that are of concern for us, the lack of representation of students with disabilities, the English learner program, the suspension rates.

04:43:12.470 --> 04:43:24.660
And looking at Rocketship Futuro and data on the California School Dashboard, it appears that there are three students with disabilities at Rocketship Futuro right now is what I count in the demographics.

04:43:25.061 --> 04:43:26.202
So that's all concern.

04:43:26.982 --> 04:43:34.569
Of concern to the superintendent as well is the governance model, particularly for those of us in Contra Costa County needing to somehow attend

04:43:35.129 --> 04:43:48.715
even if by virtue of a virtual connection, a governing board that's meeting in San Jose is extremely difficult and is counter to all of our objectives around parent and stakeholder engagement.

04:43:48.735 --> 04:43:58.018
So for all those reasons, and I'm happy to go into more detail if anyone would like, I just want to repeat our recommendation that we uphold the CDE staff recommendation.

04:43:59.699 --> 04:44:01.400
A board member, Holiday, is next.

04:44:01.440 --> 04:44:01.680
Yeah.

04:44:03.834 --> 04:44:11.381
Okay, are we close to any more questions or we can... Board Member Valdez.

04:44:13.603 --> 04:44:15.926
Thank you for your comments, Superintendent Price.

04:44:18.269 --> 04:44:36.957
So staff did the six letters and I saw that one of the concerns was fiscal and then I'm looking at this document here and it shows that the school is claiming that they have 13 or 10 percent reserve this year and ending last year and then going into this coming year 13 percent and they're going to grow by over 200 students.

04:44:37.017 --> 04:44:38.197
How can they make that claim?

04:44:38.778 --> 04:44:39.558
I'm asking Lisa.

04:44:45.615 --> 04:44:47.476
That part I can't attest to.

04:44:47.716 --> 04:44:59.039
What I can tell you is that what we have seen is that just in for Futura alone, the June letter that we sent, they had negative ending fund balances and no reserve.

04:44:59.299 --> 04:45:01.700
So that was from the second interim report.

04:45:02.060 --> 04:45:09.862
So as we dug into that and we have had communications with them since then, as a petitioner did mention, we've been talking about why that is.

04:45:09.882 --> 04:45:10.663
So we're

04:45:11.903 --> 04:45:20.087
trying to relay to them that as an author, we are in the role of oversight on behalf of the State Board.

04:45:20.447 --> 04:45:22.468
The MOU says 5% reserve.

04:45:23.009 --> 04:45:27.811
And so we're not seeing that in their interim reports that they're submitting to us.

04:45:28.391 --> 04:45:34.674
But that is including these intercompany loans and these deferral, these manager fees that they've included.

04:45:34.694 --> 04:45:34.734
So,

04:45:36.295 --> 04:45:46.939
The last we spoke to them just yesterday, if they do more of a modified accrual approach and they're talking about other ways of looking at their finances, that takes those payments out.

04:45:47.039 --> 04:45:51.341
So that takes them having to pay back the loans and deferring those 15% fees.

04:45:51.701 --> 04:45:56.083
It takes those things out and brings them to less of a negative fund balance.

04:45:56.463 --> 04:46:00.564
So that's what we're seeing right now in the communications we've had with them.

04:46:02.705 --> 04:46:10.751
That to us is still a concern, but at least now we're understanding better how they're looking at it versus how we're looking at it on behalf of the board.

04:46:10.771 --> 04:46:11.692
Okay.

04:46:12.192 --> 04:46:16.416
Can I ask, when you say less of a fund balance, it's still a negative fund balance?

04:46:16.496 --> 04:46:24.422
It's still negative, but it's like $6,000 versus, I think we're at $3,000 or $4,000, right around that range.

04:46:24.562 --> 04:46:31.747
So it's definitely less, but we're starting to better understand how they're looking at it versus how we're looking at it.

04:46:33.490 --> 04:46:36.336
Board Member Ruckers next and then Board Member Williams.

04:46:36.356 --> 04:46:38.902
I'm hoping we're getting close to a motion.

04:46:39.062 --> 04:46:39.423
OK.

04:46:39.483 --> 04:46:41.427
My question is for the charter manager.

04:46:54.355 --> 04:46:56.177
Thank you for coming back to the podium.

04:46:56.317 --> 04:47:06.648
I usually am not the one who asks questions about the finances because there are people who follow those budgets in far more minute detail than I do.

04:47:07.029 --> 04:47:15.437
But there was something in the conversation that you had with Dr. Kirst, with Board President Kirst, that I just wanted to get some clarification on.

04:47:16.218 --> 04:47:22.861
Again, I thought I understood what the concerns were on the fiscal issue till everybody started talking about it.

04:47:23.321 --> 04:47:33.404
So, let me just ask a couple of questions to help me get clear on what is the, for me, what is the crux of the understanding about your process.

04:47:33.444 --> 04:47:40.947
So, we have the site-based budgets for each of the school sites here, but we also have a network budget.

04:47:41.287 --> 04:47:45.429
Can you tell me about where the funds for your network budget actually come from?

04:47:48.908 --> 04:47:55.351
The funds for our network budget, if you mean as we, if you look at each individual school and consolidate, is that your question?

04:47:56.272 --> 04:47:57.792
Just to be sure that I answer correctly.

04:47:58.132 --> 04:48:11.779
I suppose I'm, for the operating budget for the CMO itself, where do those, do you sweep any funds from the site-based budgets as part of your budgeting for the CMO?

04:48:12.119 --> 04:48:12.399
I see.

04:48:12.739 --> 04:48:17.602
So our network or our national support

04:48:18.582 --> 04:48:27.587
group essentially provides in terms of what the network support group does and then I'll express what the financials are to support that effort.

04:48:27.827 --> 04:48:29.748
Okay, I'm not asking you what the funds pay for.

04:48:30.128 --> 04:48:32.329
I want to know where the funds come from.

04:48:32.509 --> 04:48:34.691
The funds are a combination of two sources.

04:48:34.831 --> 04:48:42.475
We receive philanthropy and we also charge our schools a network support fee.

04:48:43.255 --> 04:48:53.339
There are funds that come from state from from site based budgets in this state that go to your network budget based on a fee.

04:48:53.379 --> 04:48:54.039
Is that correct?

04:48:55.059 --> 04:48:55.519
That is correct.

04:48:55.539 --> 04:48:56.820
But that is to provide services.

04:48:56.960 --> 04:48:58.000
I understand.

04:48:58.140 --> 04:49:02.522
And we only charge charge that service fee if a school is able to pay.

04:49:02.902 --> 04:49:04.343
And I want to be very clear about that.

04:49:04.383 --> 04:49:11.105
And that if our if a school is in a startup situation, if enrollment is still growing, enrollment is not reached.

04:49:11.665 --> 04:49:14.106
It's projected total.

04:49:14.126 --> 04:49:28.394
If the school does not have a positive fund balance, a positive cash reserve, then we do not ask that school to make that network service payment to the network.

04:49:28.914 --> 04:49:31.956
We defer that until the time at which the school is healthy.

04:49:32.536 --> 04:49:42.128
So we're very, very careful to be thoughtful about the health of the school and to be sure that the school is able to provide and to pay that fee.

04:49:42.348 --> 04:49:43.630
We still provide the same support.

04:49:43.690 --> 04:49:44.911
The support does not change.

04:49:44.971 --> 04:49:49.496
It's still the full support, but there is no charge if the school is unable to pay.

04:49:50.097 --> 04:49:51.638
All right.

04:49:51.678 --> 04:50:02.186
So where I started getting confused was the conversation about the reserves and the differences in how the reserves were being calculated to identify whether or not we have a fiscal issue.

04:50:02.486 --> 04:50:06.629
And given that there seems to be a fiscal issue, how large it is.

04:50:07.029 --> 04:50:12.633
So there seems to be a reserve that you as the network, as the CMO has.

04:50:12.713 --> 04:50:13.394
Is that correct?

04:50:14.335 --> 04:50:14.936
That's correct.

04:50:14.976 --> 04:50:20.620
How much is, what is, what is the percentage of your reserve over our required amount?

04:50:22.441 --> 04:50:24.343
So there's a five percent requirement.

04:50:24.403 --> 04:50:25.964
How much is your reserve actually?

04:50:27.955 --> 04:50:31.556
I think it's appropriate to talk about the reserve on a school-by-school basis.

04:50:31.576 --> 04:50:37.699
I don't think I can answer the question without further data about what you're saying.

04:50:37.799 --> 04:50:40.021
What is that reserve on the network basis?

04:50:40.641 --> 04:50:48.585
And I want to clarify, I think we were referring to the presentation at one point and looking at the reserve calculation in the presentation and asking what that was.

04:50:49.145 --> 04:50:54.466
And I think this is something that we've had some good conversation with staff with over with the CD staff this week on.

04:50:55.006 --> 04:51:01.787
The presentation we shared, our definition was the cash reserve specifically available to the school to support its operation.

04:51:03.347 --> 04:51:16.530
And so when we look to having over 5% or having greater level of reserve for the school and what we showed in our presentation, it was related specifically to the cash available at the school.

04:51:18.150 --> 04:51:20.811
So, I'm hoping that helps to answer your question.

04:51:21.071 --> 04:51:28.914
Some, because I think it makes me believe the next question I'm about to ask you is not an appropriate question for me to ask.

04:51:29.755 --> 04:51:38.058
So, when you have some school sites that seem to be in a revenue shortfall or in some kind of financial trouble,

04:51:38.778 --> 04:51:53.263
What is your, do you have an obligation or do you believe you have a responsibility as the CMO to sweep funds from your budget over to that school site to assist in that financial or fiscal issue?

04:51:53.883 --> 04:51:56.764
We do, and that's where our philanthropy comes in.

04:51:56.844 --> 04:52:01.865
We look to philanthropy as being the source for helping to start up our schools.

04:52:01.925 --> 04:52:09.347
We know that schools need to reach enrollment in order to be healthier, and we raise money to do that.

04:52:10.327 --> 04:52:21.850
And when a school is in a deficit or still growing, we take the philanthropy that is raised, whether that be at the local level or philanthropy that is raised at the national level, and we use those funds to support the school.

04:52:23.092 --> 04:52:25.955
Okay, so I guess that's why I'm confused.

04:52:25.995 --> 04:52:38.828
If that's the work that you do as the umbrella organization, why is it that the schools where there is this question about the fiscal issues, how long do these problems remain in place before you

04:52:39.469 --> 04:52:41.771
implement a plan to resolve or close the gap.

04:52:41.791 --> 04:52:47.657
Because the reason I'm asking it, and again, based on your earlier explanation, it actually helped clarify something for me.

04:52:48.178 --> 04:52:56.606
My concern is that as the CMO, in doing the work that you do either to charge a fee and receive state funds from California,

04:52:57.066 --> 04:53:04.431
that you put into your budget for a reserve that you can't disclose to me because it's a complicated way of explaining how it's calculated.

04:53:04.871 --> 04:53:15.218
My concern is those reserves go to the benefit of schools that are not in California and that's the reason why there seems to be this fiscal shortfall at these schools.

04:53:15.678 --> 04:53:15.819
So,

04:53:16.639 --> 04:53:44.443
correct me, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but based on what I'm trying to follow in this whole conversation between the two different budgeting processes and the difference in the way the CDE reviewed your budget and the way you explained they ought to review it, I'm just concerned that when you sweep state funds into the budget that you have total control over, that you allow these schools to continue to function in this with a fiscal crisis and you don't use the funds that you've taken from them to help restore or make them whole.

04:53:45.103 --> 04:53:46.984
No, we don't do that.

04:53:47.184 --> 04:53:51.665
We use philanthropy to support schools that have deficits.

04:53:52.525 --> 04:53:55.927
And so, there isn't a situation as you described.

04:53:57.227 --> 04:54:01.308
We are very careful and would not want to see that happen at schools.

04:54:01.328 --> 04:54:03.369
We're using philanthropy if there is a deficit.

04:54:04.189 --> 04:54:19.575
And in terms of coming back to I think the question about the fiscal, the differences in the fiscal information from staff and what we've discussed this week with staff to better make sure that we're on the same page going forward and that we're able to more clearly meet their requirements and to not have a miscommunication.

04:54:21.075 --> 04:54:31.879
We with our philanthropy, the San Pablo School in year one would have a positive balance, positive fund balance and would be able to meet the requirements

04:54:32.760 --> 04:54:33.861
as outlined by the staff.

04:54:34.842 --> 04:54:45.753
We did not show that philanthropy in our budgets, but we do have a letter of that support in terms of our existing school, Futuro.

04:54:46.534 --> 04:54:54.202
As we shared with the staff yesterday in a good conversation with the accounting that is

04:54:54.602 --> 04:55:00.987
that we're able to use our modified accrual accounting which the staff agrees with as being appropriate and acceptable.

04:55:01.808 --> 04:55:15.438
Our deficit this year from a fund balance will be nearly zero and we will be making going back to satisfy the staff's questions to turn that around this year to be have a positive balance.

04:55:16.078 --> 04:55:20.260
And we want to be very responsive to the staff's concerns.

04:55:20.620 --> 04:55:31.105
We hadn't had an opportunity to sit with them and really understand them clearly, as we described earlier, because of some of the communication in letters that we didn't have a chance to discuss with them.

04:55:31.425 --> 04:55:38.588
But now that we have a really good line of communication, we want to make sure that they're very comfortable and we feel that we have a good path for doing that.

04:55:38.928 --> 04:55:39.648
Okay, thank you.

04:55:39.728 --> 04:55:40.909
Lisa, I have one question for you.

04:55:48.046 --> 04:55:50.547
Let me see if I can express this in a single word.

04:55:52.848 --> 04:55:53.528
I'm sorry.

04:55:53.548 --> 04:55:54.989
Okay.

04:55:55.029 --> 04:55:57.450
What I can say... I didn't mean for you to say I'm sorry.

04:55:57.590 --> 04:55:57.970
I know.

04:55:58.590 --> 04:55:59.330
Sorry, I caught myself.

04:56:00.551 --> 04:56:03.872
I was just having a conversation with Nick about this also.

04:56:04.352 --> 04:56:11.035
So, even though they may have cash reserves,

04:56:12.202 --> 04:56:14.224
that doesn't mean they don't have debt.

04:56:15.245 --> 04:56:31.941
So, in what we're looking at and when we went through the second interim report and looked through their finances, even like I mentioned, even by pulling out what they owed in these loans and deferral fees, management fees, they still had accounts receivable that hadn't been paid.

04:56:32.601 --> 04:56:36.323
So, we're trying to balance that at school by school.

04:56:36.383 --> 04:56:38.284
So, I mean, we're not looking at the network.

04:56:38.304 --> 04:56:39.784
We're just looking at Futuro.

04:56:40.184 --> 04:56:45.287
We're just looking at, you know, what their enrollment is and what their, what their budget looks like.

04:56:45.387 --> 04:56:55.371
And so, we're just looking at that school without the, without Rocketship, the corporation, coming in to adding additional funds into that budget.

04:56:55.811 --> 04:57:14.052
So, based on what we were seeing and based on what we reported to the board, they were in a poor financial situation and that's why we deemed them that and we're trying to treat all the schools the same to be consistent so that all of the state board authorized schools are being exactly looked at the same way.

04:57:14.653 --> 04:57:14.833
So,

04:57:16.124 --> 04:57:16.685
I hope that helps.

04:57:16.765 --> 04:57:17.465
You read my mind.

04:57:17.485 --> 04:57:26.694
I wanted to know is the way that you did the analysis and the review different than how you do it for any of the other state board authorized schools.

04:57:27.054 --> 04:57:28.715
That was going to be my second question.

04:57:28.735 --> 04:57:30.777
So thank you very much for going ahead and answering it.

04:57:31.098 --> 04:57:31.438
Thank you.

04:57:33.027 --> 04:57:36.750
OK, Board Member Williams, we're at the two hour mark here.

04:57:36.970 --> 04:57:43.216
And so it's generally when I begin to think we could move to some kind of a motion.

04:57:43.456 --> 04:57:45.498
And thank you.

04:57:45.738 --> 04:57:46.218
Go ahead.

04:57:47.679 --> 04:57:49.621
OK, I have a I have a couple of comments.

04:57:51.650 --> 04:57:58.176
It has been a lengthy discussion and there's been a lot of passion on both sides.

04:58:00.538 --> 04:58:12.708
And I'm going to align myself also with Feliza and Ting in terms of not appreciating the negative comments toward us.

04:58:15.110 --> 04:58:17.871
I myself am first generation to go to college.

04:58:18.431 --> 04:58:20.772
My mother was the first to graduate from high school.

04:58:22.193 --> 04:58:33.558
So I'm not going to feel embarrassed about supporting schools that do really great things for kids that need those kinds of opportunities and extra support.

04:58:33.618 --> 04:58:36.839
And I won't be put down for how I go about doing it.

04:58:38.819 --> 04:58:43.761
That said, I have known Rocketship almost since the beginning.

04:58:43.781 --> 04:58:50.802
I don't know them well and don't have an ongoing relationship with them, but I knew them when they first started.

04:58:50.822 --> 04:58:58.104
I toured one of their San Jose schools and watched their creative way of using

04:58:59.064 --> 04:59:14.433
personalized instruction combined with small groups, using the data daily to see where each student was and then regrouping and regrouping students to advance them more quickly through basic skills and then also enrichment and advanced thinking.

04:59:15.393 --> 04:59:18.116
I know the CMO, again, I don't know it well.

04:59:18.176 --> 04:59:26.624
I don't have a personal relationship with it or communicate on a regular basis with any of them, but I know that they are well-respected and well-funded.

04:59:27.465 --> 04:59:29.748
I'm not worried about their finances one bit.

04:59:29.888 --> 04:59:31.810
I'm not worried about their educational program.

04:59:32.450 --> 04:59:37.392
I think they started with a focus on low-income English learners.

04:59:38.073 --> 04:59:40.074
And they have kept that all the way through.

04:59:40.174 --> 04:59:45.736
Yes, sometimes some of their schools also have African-American students, maybe some Asian students.

04:59:47.237 --> 04:59:53.379
But their focus was, let's get this group of students and start closing the achievement gap that they have.

04:59:53.419 --> 04:59:56.521
That's been a burning passion for them, and it's something that I admire.

04:59:57.041 --> 05:00:00.583
And another thing I admire about them is that they're a learning organization.

05:00:01.924 --> 05:00:20.480
They started out with an instructional model that was innovative and after a year or two or three, I can't remember, they modified it, modified the amount of screen time, modified the amount of outside time, modified the amount of teacher time, small group, large group, always looking for ways to improve.

05:00:22.580 --> 05:00:29.593
So on those two bases, there's nothing about this CMO in particular that I have any kind of concerns about.

05:00:29.633 --> 05:00:32.238
In fact, I have admiration and respect for them.

05:00:36.266 --> 05:00:50.571
Now that said, I think we're, this is an unfortunate kind of time because as you can tell by this room, the tensions around charter and district issues are at fever pitch.

05:00:51.652 --> 05:00:57.074
And they will certainly remain that way at least through the November election and maybe after.

05:00:58.996 --> 05:01:00.637
And so it affects all of us.

05:01:00.877 --> 05:01:09.423
And in fact, you know, people speaking up more often about charters than they normally would, they would have a year ago even.

05:01:10.863 --> 05:01:19.709
And so some of that, a reminder to you all that the board, the law requires the board to do a de novo review of every charter petition.

05:01:20.790 --> 05:01:24.272
We do not confirm the local control decision.

05:01:24.312 --> 05:01:26.814
We don't confirm what the district did or what the county did.

05:01:26.894 --> 05:01:31.318
The law requires us to look at it with fresh eyes and come to our own conclusion.

05:01:32.639 --> 05:01:34.280
Now, that said, I think we've done that.

05:01:34.460 --> 05:01:40.345
And I think we've done that with the petition and we've done that with the hearing and with all the questions that we've asked.

05:01:41.205 --> 05:01:53.634
And so I'm in this awkward position of feeling like this is an outstanding CMO that does great things for students, but I am a little concerned about how fast you're replicating.

05:01:55.375 --> 05:02:10.485
It feels like a pretty aggressive replication, and it's coming at a time when the political environment, which is not supposed to be a reason for denial, and I'm not going to give that as a reason for denial, but the political environment makes it more difficult for you to do that.

05:02:12.507 --> 05:02:23.077
And given the Futura, that's unfortunate that that particular school, so many, the majority of your schools do outstanding, have no problems.

05:02:23.458 --> 05:02:27.522
That school happened to be our state board school and it's, you know, had a few concerns.

05:02:28.102 --> 05:02:32.687
So that context doesn't make it easy to make a decision.

05:02:34.349 --> 05:02:41.615
So I'm going to surprise my colleagues and move the CDE recommendation to deny this petition.

05:02:42.856 --> 05:02:43.196
Second.

05:02:43.717 --> 05:02:50.502
Okay, any further discussion if that's the recommendation?

05:02:52.504 --> 05:02:53.504
Okay, we're ready to vote.

05:02:53.544 --> 05:02:54.045
Call the roll.

05:02:57.408 --> 05:02:57.628
Okay.

05:02:57.648 --> 05:02:59.669
Sue.

05:02:59.689 --> 05:03:00.030
Aye.

05:03:02.652 --> 05:03:02.892
Hema.

05:03:04.448 --> 05:03:04.788
Bruce.

05:03:06.089 --> 05:03:06.349
Mike.

05:03:09.651 --> 05:03:10.072
It is on.

05:03:10.732 --> 05:03:11.052
It's on.

05:03:14.775 --> 05:03:16.015
Sue was yes.

05:03:16.176 --> 05:03:16.976
Hema was yes.

05:03:17.316 --> 05:03:18.217
Bruce was yes.

05:03:18.337 --> 05:03:18.997
Now we're on Mike.

05:03:20.018 --> 05:03:20.819
Okay.

05:03:20.879 --> 05:03:21.119
No.

05:03:21.139 --> 05:03:22.139
Okay.

05:03:22.379 --> 05:03:22.840
Feliza.

05:03:24.121 --> 05:03:24.241
Aye.

05:03:25.241 --> 05:03:25.762
Patricia.

05:03:26.702 --> 05:03:27.002
Yes.

05:03:28.263 --> 05:03:28.463
Nikki.

05:03:28.483 --> 05:03:28.583
Yes.

05:03:29.844 --> 05:03:30.225
Eileen.

05:03:30.245 --> 05:03:30.305
Yes.

05:03:31.365 --> 05:03:31.585
Ting.

05:03:31.605 --> 05:03:31.665
Yes.

05:03:33.627 --> 05:03:33.947
Karen.

05:03:34.961 --> 05:03:37.443
Petition is denied

05:03:48.317 --> 05:03:55.505
Okay, now I'm asking for us to take the public comment because we want to make sure we have a quorum.

05:03:55.805 --> 05:03:58.408
We have 16 general public comment.

05:03:58.748 --> 05:04:03.072
These are for issues not on our agenda, not on our agenda.

05:04:03.613 --> 05:04:07.337
So would you call the roll please to have the public comment.

05:04:08.484 --> 05:04:11.185
Will the following individuals please line up?

05:04:12.185 --> 05:04:33.434
Justin Goodrich, Ed Haldago, Tamara Otero, David Maraschuto, Park Guthrie, Susan Lund, Alex Lund, Mike Hutchison, Justin Goodrich, Elaine Brown, Rob Senske, Charles Boyd,

05:04:34.924 --> 05:04:40.705
Shelly Hamilton, Cyrus Morris, Barbara McAndrews, Camrina Ramirez.

05:04:43.046 --> 05:04:43.426
Go ahead.

05:04:43.806 --> 05:04:44.406
Good afternoon.

05:04:45.566 --> 05:04:46.426
Thanks for having us back.

05:04:46.466 --> 05:04:53.788
I was here yesterday to speak a little bit about curriculum frameworks and standards at the grade levels.

05:04:54.928 --> 05:04:58.969
And I just wanted to have just a little bit more time to expand on those thoughts.

05:04:59.889 --> 05:05:16.937
We're asking the board to take a look at the curriculum frameworks through a lens that is not building the content from grade level to grade level, but through the lens of what are we asking our students to learn at each grade level as a whole.

05:05:18.097 --> 05:05:24.322
So for example, what are we asking a sixth grade student to learn throughout the duration of sixth grade?

05:05:25.502 --> 05:05:47.377
And what we're asking the board to take a look at when you do that is where in those curriculum frameworks are the important life and workplace skills like social emotional awareness, presentation literacy, effective communication, collaboration, empathy, problem solving, critical thinking,

05:05:49.339 --> 05:05:57.189
Where in the curriculum frameworks do we provide an opportunity for students to learn about their own strengths, interests, and values, as well as their own work?

05:05:58.190 --> 05:05:58.410
Time.

05:05:58.491 --> 05:05:59.812
Sorry, I didn't know I only had one minute.

05:06:00.032 --> 05:06:01.334
Yeah, time, one minute.

05:06:02.235 --> 05:06:02.996
Your time is up.

05:06:03.277 --> 05:06:03.557
Thank you.

05:06:10.930 --> 05:06:11.551
Good afternoon.

05:06:11.711 --> 05:06:12.832
Thanks for having us back.

05:06:12.992 --> 05:06:17.816
I'm Tamara Otero, president of San Diego County School Board Association and a trustee in Cajon Valley.

05:06:17.836 --> 05:06:20.639
I want to thank you again to your commitment for education.

05:06:20.699 --> 05:06:26.244
I greatly respect the work you're doing here and admire your dedication to the betterment of California through our youth.

05:06:27.185 --> 05:06:36.988
Our current system continually adds tools to build equity in education, yet we haven't begun to break apart the system that supported the inequity in achievement and opportunity.

05:06:37.008 --> 05:06:39.089
And it does concern me.

05:06:39.169 --> 05:06:40.509
It concerns me as a trustee.

05:06:40.569 --> 05:06:41.890
It concerns me as a parent.

05:06:42.590 --> 05:06:50.593
I see our hours of influence in the classroom are often filled with rhetoric and repetitiveness that support the disengagement that we see that starts in third grade.

05:06:51.253 --> 05:06:57.356
And we could be influencing tomorrow's leaders with an education with relevance, which drives the learning process through engagement.

05:06:58.096 --> 05:07:10.986
It's really time for California to break apart the education system that we currently have and look to states like Ohio who have developed new education standards and a new system so that they can better support kids.

05:07:11.706 --> 05:07:18.031
I would personally love to invite you to visit our classrooms in Cajon Valley and see what we're doing as an answer to that.

05:07:18.271 --> 05:07:19.112
Thank you for your time.

05:07:23.550 --> 05:07:24.891
You had a very long morning.

05:07:27.132 --> 05:07:30.194
Rather than share my comments my comments are in the letter.

05:07:30.214 --> 05:07:35.797
I will just thank you for the work this morning Trustee Sun with the Workforce Committee.

05:07:35.817 --> 05:07:43.262
I would love to connect with you on that and simply say with the conversation on college or career, college and career how about just career?

05:07:44.147 --> 05:07:47.969
Because any college pathway is going to hopefully result in a career.

05:07:48.489 --> 05:07:56.172
And if we start with career development early on, then kids, when they go to invest $100,000 into a college degree, will get 100% return on their investment.

05:07:57.152 --> 05:07:58.473
College isn't a place to figure it out.

05:07:58.633 --> 05:08:00.934
It's a place to go with intention for a career.

05:08:01.514 --> 05:08:03.615
And we have some resources to share, and we'll connect with you later.

05:08:04.155 --> 05:08:05.216
Again, thank you for your service.

05:08:05.256 --> 05:08:08.057
You're doing tremendous work, and I appreciate your volunteerism.

05:08:13.991 --> 05:08:14.831
Good afternoon.

05:08:15.492 --> 05:08:19.474
My name is Sarah Morris and I'm a second grade teacher from Imperial County.

05:08:20.054 --> 05:08:29.679
I just wanted to let the board know that as a professional educator I'm becoming very concerned with some of the situations going on statewide with charter schools.

05:08:30.259 --> 05:08:34.822
Charters have been given extreme latitude within the law for the purpose of innovation

05:08:35.482 --> 05:08:40.946
Yet, what I'm seeing is less innovation and more problems involving financial misdealings.

05:08:41.866 --> 05:08:47.930
I see schools that aren't adequately educating students within the current appeals process.

05:08:47.970 --> 05:08:50.732
They seem to get chance after chance after chance.

05:08:51.773 --> 05:08:58.077
I see that for-profit corporations are fleecing our tax dollars from California and they're being sent who knows where.

05:08:58.458 --> 05:09:08.805
Maybe this conversation needs to take place across the street, but I just wanted to express my frustration and from a classroom teacher's perspective, I wanted to let you know kind of how we're feeling.

05:09:09.126 --> 05:09:17.752
But I thank this board for asking those good probing questions and trying to get to the bottom of it and sort out this mess that it's become.

05:09:18.293 --> 05:09:18.693
Thank you.

05:09:23.442 --> 05:09:28.803
Hi, my name is Barbara McAndrews and I'm a public school teacher in the Imperial Valley.

05:09:29.763 --> 05:09:37.905
I'm pleased as a teacher and tax payer you are reviewing the petitions for renewal by charters very seriously.

05:09:38.645 --> 05:09:45.667
Charter schools should be governed with the same rules and regulations as public schools are and I thank you for your time this afternoon.

05:09:51.110 --> 05:09:51.711
Good afternoon.

05:09:51.751 --> 05:09:53.112
My name is Carmina Ramirez.

05:09:53.192 --> 05:09:55.453
And first, thank you for today's session.

05:09:56.034 --> 05:09:58.275
I'm a teacher librarian in the Imperial Valley.

05:09:58.956 --> 05:10:05.740
And I'm speaking as an educator and parent today who is very concerned about predatory charter schools.

05:10:05.860 --> 05:10:10.663
In our community, they have taken advantage of the trust that parents have placed on them.

05:10:11.904 --> 05:10:15.707
They have made promises that they just simply cannot keep.

05:10:16.847 --> 05:10:19.268
Instead, they have neglected the well-being of our students.

05:10:19.809 --> 05:10:24.971
They have denied access to special education resources and they spend money irresponsibly.

05:10:25.391 --> 05:10:35.075
I ask the board to keep our kids as a priority always when school boards and county offices of education plead with you to deny renewal licenses.

05:10:36.055 --> 05:10:42.118
Why do they get so many opportunities at messing up with what is most important to us, our kids?

05:10:42.338 --> 05:10:42.678
Thank you.

05:10:49.013 --> 05:10:52.335
Trustees, thank you for your important work and service to California kids.

05:10:52.515 --> 05:10:53.496
My name is Park Guthrie.

05:10:53.516 --> 05:10:56.157
I've been a California public school teacher for 17 years.

05:10:56.557 --> 05:10:58.178
I teach sixth grade in Sonoma County.

05:10:58.218 --> 05:11:00.980
I'm also the parent of three kids in California public schools.

05:11:01.400 --> 05:11:09.725
I respectfully request that you follow the lead of 23 school boards across California, Colorado, and New York to pass nonpartisan climate action resolutions.

05:11:10.205 --> 05:11:12.266
As you know, climate change is not a partisan issue.

05:11:12.694 --> 05:11:16.056
It is a generational justice, a social justice, and a human rights issue.

05:11:16.476 --> 05:11:20.838
Congress has failed to act, and by doing so has put our current and future students at significant risk.

05:11:21.239 --> 05:11:21.999
We know the harm.

05:11:22.359 --> 05:11:23.560
We are mandated reporters.

05:11:24.020 --> 05:11:30.864
No educator or educational institution has to be a silent witness to the generational neglect that national inaction on climate constitutes.

05:11:31.274 --> 05:11:35.076
You have an inspirational history of fighting for equity and justice for all California kids.

05:11:35.476 --> 05:11:41.579
By passing a climate action resolution, you can clarify the moral imperative for Congress to act to protect our students.

05:11:41.979 --> 05:11:46.882
If you do so, likely hundreds of school boards across the state and possibly thousands across the country will join you.

05:11:47.342 --> 05:11:52.425
Together, the educational sector can help break the logjam on rational climate action in DC.

05:11:52.805 --> 05:11:53.145
Thank you.

05:12:01.411 --> 05:12:05.753
Hello my name is Alex Lund and I'm an eighth grade student from San Anselmo California.

05:12:06.074 --> 05:12:12.317
I'm here today to ask the State Board of Education to end the charter appeal process to ensure the local control of our public schools.

05:12:12.777 --> 05:12:17.920
I've been in the Ross Valley School District since the age of five when I started Wade Thomas Elementary School.

05:12:18.320 --> 05:12:21.923
For six years I had an amazing learning experience with the Wade-Thomas community.

05:12:22.484 --> 05:12:32.232
I am now a student at White Hill Middle School and the soft transitions they offered us helped diminish the majority of the stress around entering a new school that was much bigger than the environment that we were used to.

05:12:32.612 --> 05:12:39.518
When I entered middle school the building where our classes were held was separate from the 7th and 8th grade buildings and we barely interacted with the other two grades.

05:12:39.938 --> 05:12:51.940
By the end of the year I found out that the following year our school would be losing most of our sixth grade building, close to half of our blacktop, the library on Mondays and the gym on Fridays to a new K-5 charter school being opened on our campus.

05:12:52.581 --> 05:13:03.383
At first I was confused about this happening because we already have three charter schools in the Marin County area and many great homeschool programs so why do we need another that would directly be taking resources from our school and its district.

05:13:03.983 --> 05:13:08.424
Many classmates of mine are being taught in flex spaces with always whiteboards for walls.

05:13:08.984 --> 05:13:09.364
Thank you.

05:13:13.672 --> 05:13:14.212
Good afternoon.

05:13:14.352 --> 05:13:15.532
My name is Rob Sandusky.

05:13:15.613 --> 05:13:17.773
I'm also from the Ross Valley School District.

05:13:17.813 --> 05:13:23.775
I stand with Ross Valley Public Schools as well as with our friends here from Richmond today, Oakland, San Francisco, San Jose, and others.

05:13:23.995 --> 05:13:27.175
And first off, I want to thank you for your deliberations today.

05:13:27.195 --> 05:13:33.457
I really appreciate not just the outcome, because I am biased, but that you put so much time and effort and good questioning into it.

05:13:33.837 --> 05:13:39.905
I would also like to encourage you as the governing body to return the ability to approve charters back to the local level.

05:13:40.085 --> 05:13:41.146
We know these communities.

05:13:41.327 --> 05:13:42.288
We are those communities.

05:13:42.768 --> 05:13:47.474
We know all the nuances that the state, with the distance from where we live, can't possibly know.

05:13:47.574 --> 05:13:48.656
So that's where that...

05:13:49.396 --> 05:13:50.257
control should happen.

05:13:51.597 --> 05:13:57.140
We've experienced some pretty nasty things in our community as a result of the charter school that was just mentioned.

05:13:58.260 --> 05:14:06.584
And by removing that ability for us to decide whether that's right for our community, it's a form of taxation without representation.

05:14:06.664 --> 05:14:14.228
So we encourage that you encourage the legislature to pass laws as you have the power to help do that, that will bring that back to the local level.

05:14:14.468 --> 05:14:14.908
Thank you again.

05:14:18.905 --> 05:14:22.427
Hello, my name is Charlie Bott and I'm also part of the Ross Valley School District.

05:14:23.088 --> 05:14:32.334
The student that was speaking previously, the middle school she was at, they had an influx of students for her year, but we did the right thing a few years ago.

05:14:32.394 --> 05:14:37.437
We passed a bond to build on that school so that they could house those students.

05:14:37.697 --> 05:14:45.725
By the time that those kids got there, the charter, which didn't even exist when we passed that bond, moved into those spaces.

05:14:45.946 --> 05:14:48.148
And those kids, they had no lockers.

05:14:48.268 --> 05:14:51.371
The sixth graders were wearing backpacks around school all the time.

05:14:51.892 --> 05:14:53.173
That's the environment that we're in.

05:14:53.433 --> 05:14:54.034
Let's be clear.

05:14:54.715 --> 05:15:00.260
Charters are private entities that are using public funds without public representation.

05:15:00.561 --> 05:15:00.861
Thank you.

05:15:17.853 --> 05:15:25.376
ACP moratorium on charter schools until you can go through the legislative process that I believe is going to be starting up with your task force.

05:15:25.756 --> 05:15:44.763
And I really believe that this is an important point in time for reviewing charter law and looking at some reforms because it is a heated issue and what we've seen in our community is because of the inconsistencies and because of sometimes the internal contradictions in the law and some accountability issues, it's left up to neighbors to be fighting each other.

05:15:45.483 --> 05:15:47.005
and it's left up to the courts.

05:15:47.045 --> 05:15:56.692
We just had a recent lawsuit, and so there's a lot of public money that's being spent on lawsuits and a lot of school board time that's being taken up because there needs to be reform in our charter law.

05:15:56.732 --> 05:16:02.076
So I really, really want to encourage you to take that seriously and to consider a moratorium.

05:16:02.157 --> 05:16:11.404
I also have a letter here that I'd like to leave with you that I sent back in August of 2017 about the issue going on, and I never received a response, so I thought I'd bring it to you today.

05:16:16.425 --> 05:16:17.386
With Pam right there.

05:16:17.907 --> 05:16:22.991
Thank you all very much for the public comments and for the people who waited through our long hearing.

05:16:23.492 --> 05:16:30.978
And just to share with you that we all will read those letters if we haven't already read them and take really into consideration what your comments were.

05:16:31.378 --> 05:16:32.239
Thank you very much.

05:16:32.279 --> 05:16:35.982
We have, we're going to do our board reports now and we're going to go alphabetically.

05:16:36.022 --> 05:16:37.324
So Member Burr, would you go first?

05:16:37.984 --> 05:16:40.025
Oh, we need to adopt the minutes.

05:16:40.925 --> 05:16:41.526
I apologize.

05:16:41.886 --> 05:16:45.507
The draft preliminary minutes from the July board meeting.

05:16:45.567 --> 05:16:46.748
Do I have a motion to approve?

05:16:47.148 --> 05:16:47.608
So moved.

05:16:48.809 --> 05:16:49.989
Second by Bruce Holliday.

05:16:50.570 --> 05:16:51.370
All those in favor?

05:16:53.223 --> 05:16:53.643
Thank you.

05:16:55.084 --> 05:16:55.564
Member Burr.

05:16:56.245 --> 05:16:56.625
Thank you.

05:16:57.545 --> 05:17:05.169
So briefly on the California collaborative, you heard yesterday during our system of support item about some of the work that we're doing.

05:17:05.189 --> 05:17:14.694
I also want to let you know that at our last meeting, August 23rd, we began a fairly substantive planning conversation to set long term goals.

05:17:15.694 --> 05:17:18.996
As I mentioned, Eileen mentioned as well, we have a new executive director.

05:17:19.036 --> 05:17:20.996
We're very excited about Tom Armolino.

05:17:21.377 --> 05:17:31.541
Tom led us through that process, obtained substantive input not only from the board, the collaborative board, but also our partners, including the department and county offices.

05:17:32.041 --> 05:17:44.126
And those will be incorporated into final action steps at our October meeting so that when Tom comes here to the board meeting in November, you'll get to hear about that.

05:17:44.486 --> 05:17:59.656
And I just wanted to underscore that one thing that the collaborative board especially is very interested in, I know this board is very interested in, is not only setting the goals but also establishing metrics by which we will judge our success and related specifically to how well our students are doing.

05:17:59.976 --> 05:18:01.978
And I think that's a very important aspect.

05:18:02.939 --> 05:18:08.664
The other thing I wanted to mention, I wanted to elaborate a little bit on what President Kirst touched on yesterday.

05:18:08.684 --> 05:18:13.368
We are in our annual fall recruitment for our advisory committees.

05:18:14.069 --> 05:18:27.001
So I want to just be more clear about the specific things we're recruiting for, the dates by which we're asking for applications, and encourage all of you who know folks who might be interested in these to ask them to apply.

05:18:28.082 --> 05:18:35.128
So specifically we have applications due on October 5th for the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools.

05:18:35.649 --> 05:18:37.490
We're looking, we need two appointments.

05:18:37.550 --> 05:18:42.814
We're looking for a currently practicing teacher and a representative of a charter school.

05:18:43.975 --> 05:18:50.979
Also for the October 5th deadline, we're seeking applications for a California Practitioners Advisory Group, CPAG.

05:18:51.520 --> 05:18:56.823
We need two appointments there who have to meet one or more of the following categories.

05:18:56.943 --> 05:19:03.467
A charter school leader, principals and other school leaders, and teachers from traditional public schools.

05:19:04.007 --> 05:19:06.509
So again, encourage folks to apply for those.

05:19:07.209 --> 05:19:12.814
On October 10th, we need applications are due for the Instructional Quality Commission.

05:19:13.315 --> 05:19:23.323
We're seeking applications for three appointments and we're looking for expertise in history, social science, visual and performing arts, and world languages.

05:19:24.324 --> 05:19:31.971
And finally, I always hate to do this on the very first meeting for our student board member, but we're recruiting for next year's student board member.

05:19:31.991 --> 05:19:40.638
And so applications are due on October 11th for students who are interested in serving as our student board member.

05:19:41.418 --> 05:19:49.161
There's some specific requirements for that, including participating in the California Student Advisory Committee meeting that comes up in November.

05:19:49.541 --> 05:19:52.402
And I know Hema will help us out with that recruitment as well.

05:19:52.502 --> 05:19:54.683
So please encourage folks to apply.

05:19:54.723 --> 05:19:56.664
We need the best possible folks.

05:19:56.764 --> 05:19:57.104
Thank you.

05:20:04.141 --> 05:20:05.244
Thank you for having me here.

05:20:05.344 --> 05:20:06.407
I appreciate it.

05:20:06.948 --> 05:20:10.617
Even though it's like, you know, very long, I really enjoyed the conversation.

05:20:10.637 --> 05:20:12.221
I'm excited to be working with you all.

05:20:12.582 --> 05:20:12.903
Thank you.

05:20:18.921 --> 05:20:25.767
Yes, so I'm officially the Zen master of this board as evident by today's performance.

05:20:27.628 --> 05:20:33.673
So the health framework is it went out in March for a 60-day public comment.

05:20:34.093 --> 05:20:37.276
We received public comment.

05:20:37.436 --> 05:20:40.598
Our health framework is very comprehensive.

05:20:40.959 --> 05:20:42.099
It's very progressive.

05:20:42.320 --> 05:20:47.223
We can expect to have a little bit of pushback because we're actually

05:20:48.184 --> 05:20:58.009
really addressing the needs of our students and whether that is compatible or not to our understanding or faith or moral values, whatever it may be, that is information that is needed in the field.

05:20:58.069 --> 05:21:07.034
And we're getting some pretty dicey comments, but I encourage everyone to submit their comments because that is what this process really requires, right?

05:21:07.074 --> 05:21:10.996
It requires all of us to be participatory and engaged stakeholders.

05:21:11.896 --> 05:21:16.579
It will come to the IQC September 19th and then it will go back for another

05:21:17.659 --> 05:21:19.840
60 days, another 60 days.

05:21:20.201 --> 05:21:23.142
So please do provide your feedback.

05:21:24.443 --> 05:21:31.087
I was at Stanford last year, last year, last week, presenting on ESSA and Latino students.

05:21:31.787 --> 05:21:36.069
And I was able to present with Matt, I forget the last name, but he's from Bellwether.

05:21:36.389 --> 05:21:39.291
So it was an interesting panel and with Dr. Carla Estrada.

05:21:39.731 --> 05:21:44.374
And we spoke about the different components of our ESSA state plan and what that means for Latino students.

05:21:45.434 --> 05:21:58.064
And lastly, I gave opening remarks at the EO Consortium in L.A., and it's a new consortium established by the California Community Foundation and some of the most active EO groups in L.A.

05:21:58.765 --> 05:22:03.909
And we spoke about the EO roadmap and also discussed policies that relate to English learners.

05:22:04.570 --> 05:22:13.582
and engage in a little bit of back and forth with community members from Los Angeles metropolitan area in terms of their feedback on the EO roadmap.

05:22:13.662 --> 05:22:17.187
And it's something that people really like, really appreciate and have been waiting for.

05:22:17.487 --> 05:22:17.727
Thank you.

05:22:23.646 --> 05:22:28.230
Well, first of all, I'm going to begin, but if I hope you don't mind, I'm going to take a moment of personal privilege.

05:22:28.730 --> 05:22:34.555
It's been my pleasure to sit on this board and to have started my tenure on this board with seven other people.

05:22:35.276 --> 05:22:40.300
And I just want to say that the hallmark of the work that we've done has not been on the innovation.

05:22:40.800 --> 05:22:42.541
that we have considered and implemented.

05:22:43.001 --> 05:22:50.743
It's not been on creating the theme of the California Way, and it hasn't even been on how hard our conversation's been.

05:22:51.324 --> 05:23:03.648
It's really more been on the leadership that I have been able to share, the conversations that I have been able to engage in, and the very deep and thoughtful disagreements as well as agreements that we have had.

05:23:04.128 --> 05:23:07.709
It didn't matter how heightened or passionate the conversations were,

05:23:08.269 --> 05:23:16.036
They were never personal and when the meeting was over, we smiled, we talked, we shared, we had great camaraderie.

05:23:16.516 --> 05:23:34.752
And so for those who have gone on before us and are leaving and those who have already left us and for those like board member Cardenas who are joining us, I want to make sure it's clear that for us, it's about the work and it's about the leadership that we engage in to lead in this work.

05:23:35.473 --> 05:23:44.661
And while it is personal because we derive great satisfaction from what we do and what we accomplish, at the center of what we do, it's not about us.

05:23:45.512 --> 05:23:52.136
And so hearing, and I'm accustomed to being attacked just because that's what happens.

05:23:52.556 --> 05:23:56.459
But when I see one of my colleagues attack, it hurts me very deeply.

05:23:56.919 --> 05:24:01.982
So I'm very proud of not only who I work with, but who I work for and why I'm doing it.

05:24:02.442 --> 05:24:15.030
And so I want to make sure all of us agree and can definitely tell the rest of the world we work together and we strive together, but we take those hurts together as well.

05:24:16.297 --> 05:24:25.764
So having said that, having said that, the IQC is one of the agencies that I am a liaison for.

05:24:26.104 --> 05:24:29.286
The IQC has been very busy since our July board meeting.

05:24:29.767 --> 05:24:35.051
All the members of the IQC participated in facilitating the week-long science material review.

05:24:35.491 --> 05:24:40.775
I'll let our liaisons talk more about that if they want to because I know there's been some subsequent work.

05:24:41.235 --> 05:24:51.827
But when they came back for the subsequent IQC meeting at the end of July, they took a lot, they did a lot of deep study and made several actions, took action to approve several steps.

05:24:52.208 --> 05:24:56.713
Of course, you know, today we did approve the draft computer science standards.

05:24:56.753 --> 05:25:01.518
That was after a lot of work that was led by the IQC and my colleague, Trish Williams.

05:25:02.557 --> 05:25:16.920
We also approved from the Subject Matter Committee, we approved the Draft World Language Standards for 60-day public comment, as well as the online survey for the Draft World Language Standards to support submission of comment during the public review and comment period.

05:25:17.500 --> 05:25:27.282
They also approved the Visual and Performing Arts Standards for 60-day public review and comment period and approved the online survey form for the public review and comment period submission.

05:25:27.982 --> 05:25:37.791
The Health Subject Matter Committee approved edits to the draft health framework, particularly focused on the access and equity chapter seven.

05:25:38.492 --> 05:25:48.740
And then finally, we took individual time to recognize the fact that when we come back this fall for our last couple of meetings, we are going to be losing three members.

05:25:49.201 --> 05:25:53.965
It's been a great pleasure to work with the IQC and I look forward to continue doing that work.

05:25:54.085 --> 05:25:54.846
So thank you very much.

05:26:05.895 --> 05:26:17.204
The Advisory Commission on Special Education met here just a few weeks ago, and it's always a rich couple of days with very passionate people who are leaders in the field, so I'm always delighted to join them.

05:26:17.904 --> 05:26:22.708
One of the highlights of our meeting was a gallery walk in the Special Education Division.

05:26:23.548 --> 05:26:34.773
And what we did is we actually toured various units and I have to say the personnel in this division are responsible for a really complex range of contacts, activities, and issues.

05:26:36.013 --> 05:26:36.914
It was eye-opening.

05:26:37.514 --> 05:26:39.155
I wish everyone could do that.

05:26:40.315 --> 05:26:48.839
And one of the things that I came away with was this knowledge that every person is really dedicated on about

05:26:49.219 --> 05:26:51.522
or focused on students, it's very student-centered.

05:26:52.022 --> 05:26:53.304
And sometimes that can get lost.

05:26:53.344 --> 05:27:03.916
We speak in this institutional language, but really it's all about the kids and making sure that we're doing the best we can by our kids.

05:27:05.418 --> 05:27:24.653
I also appreciate the assessment development administration division talking about the individual student assessment accessibility profile process and what this is a consistent and effective system for providing appropriate accessibility resources to students based upon their needs.

05:27:25.454 --> 05:27:32.479
And we talked about professional development options for educators to support their implementation of that process.

05:27:33.500 --> 05:27:41.465
And there was an acknowledgement from the department that we need to build awareness in the field about accessibility resources to support our students.

05:27:42.286 --> 05:27:46.188
And we always have visitors from the field and parent representatives.

05:27:46.929 --> 05:27:57.936
And one of the things that I heard was that some educators are reporting that there is a direction from the districts to only use accessibility supports in the spring around assessment time.

05:27:58.516 --> 05:28:01.278
But there is

05:28:03.099 --> 05:28:08.626
more work around supporting educators to use these supports for the benefit of students.

05:28:09.567 --> 05:28:16.816
And just another note, the English learner special education guidelines are being developed right now, so that's promising.

05:28:17.377 --> 05:28:21.542
And there are also rollouts of dyslexia guidelines happening this year.

05:28:22.943 --> 05:28:24.764
California State Summer School for the Arts.

05:28:25.505 --> 05:28:33.469
More than 500 high school students completed four weeks in residence at the California State Summer School for the Arts at CalArts in Valencia.

05:28:34.209 --> 05:28:43.494
And to share a quote from Michael Fields, who's the executive director, and I quote, it is four weeks of swimming in new realms of the work being challenged to transcend the status quo.

05:28:44.174 --> 05:28:48.098
and to strongly exercise the imaginative and collaborative muscles.

05:28:49.099 --> 05:28:57.126
The experience and daily practice will definitely serve each person who is a participant for the rest of their lives.

05:28:57.566 --> 05:29:08.216
So it's just wonderful that it's been in existence for more than 31 years now and it's still going strong, making a profound impact on the lives of our students in California.

05:29:12.465 --> 05:29:16.426
I'm going to be a grandmother tonight, so I'm leaving as soon as we're done.

05:29:18.707 --> 05:29:19.187
Two things.

05:29:19.467 --> 05:29:31.410
One is that for the world languages standards, the commission took action, the draft world language and an online survey is now out for 60 days, so we encourage you to go online to the CDE website.

05:29:32.010 --> 05:29:33.530
to partake in that.

05:29:33.890 --> 05:29:42.192
And then secondly, I just wanted to say, as school started and as Superintendent Torlakson shared about the fires, our district was involved in the fires.

05:29:42.252 --> 05:29:49.633
We had a school up in the mountains, Idlewild, and the fire went all the way around the entire town, but did not burn down the town or the school.

05:29:50.014 --> 05:29:52.514
We actually had a board meeting there the other night, so that was good news.

05:29:52.954 --> 05:29:57.175
And I happen to have a husband who works in Lake Elsinore, and they had the holy fire, and that was quite

05:29:57.815 --> 05:30:23.320
big event and it was a week later that they were able to start due to all the fire cleanup and so one of the things I think eventually we want to begin to look at with all of the fires is there is FEMA there's ADA recovery but there is no cleanup dollars if you will to do recovery so the 1.5 million that the district had to take to clean up all the smoke and ash is on the district right now so that's just something down the line I think we should look at.

05:30:27.893 --> 05:30:33.035
Alphabetical, right?

05:30:33.416 --> 05:30:35.216
Two points about environmental literacy.

05:30:36.057 --> 05:30:46.902
First of all, Senate Bill 720, the environmental literacy bill, authored by Senator Ben Allen and Assemblymember Tony Thurmond, passed the California legislature on August 31st.

05:30:48.022 --> 05:30:51.865
The bill is now moving on to the governor's desk and we hope that he will sign it.

05:30:52.246 --> 05:30:58.751
The bill deepens the state's commitment to environmental literacy and in particular California's environmental principles and concepts.

05:30:59.612 --> 05:31:09.640
The bill gives direction based on the core ideas in the blueprint for environmental literacy to future state superintendents of public instruction to facilitate bringing environmental literacy to students.

05:31:10.300 --> 05:31:14.162
and encourage local school boards to be more active around environmental literacy.

05:31:14.662 --> 05:31:27.408
And the bill also encourages Cal Recycle's Office of Education and the Environment to provide technical assistance to educational agencies wherever young people are being educated about the environment using the E, P, and Cs.

05:31:27.828 --> 05:31:31.870
The members of the Environmental Literacy Steering Committee are very excited about this bill.

05:31:32.759 --> 05:31:39.361
The other item has to do with the Global Climate Action Summit that takes place this month, and I'm sure you're aware of.

05:31:39.801 --> 05:31:43.182
You may not be aware that there is an education affiliate event.

05:31:43.603 --> 05:31:57.047
The California Environmental Protection Agency, the California Department of Education, the State Board of Education, the California Subject Matter Project, Strategic Energy Innovations, Ten Strands, and the University of California Office of the President are partnering to host

05:31:57.567 --> 05:32:06.656
an education affiliate event as part of the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco on September 12, 2018, next Wednesday, right?

05:32:07.136 --> 05:32:22.331
The event will focus on elevating education, community engagement, and workforce development as an important part of driving ambitious climate change action, and it's taking place on Wednesday, September 12 at the Exploratorium in San Francisco.

05:32:22.771 --> 05:32:26.752
There's a large wait list of people and groups interested in participating.

05:32:26.992 --> 05:32:27.692
And that's all I have.

05:32:31.493 --> 05:32:33.073
So just to follow up on IQC.

05:32:33.113 --> 05:32:42.176
So while member record I do the liaison work for the general IQC work then each of us have different assignments for frameworks and content area.

05:32:42.456 --> 05:32:47.837
So just a support of the science the week of July 16th right after our board meeting there was a

05:32:48.237 --> 05:32:50.719
intensive week of review of materials.

05:32:51.159 --> 05:32:59.545
So I think it was 34 materials were submitted, five were not approved, and they have a whole hearing process, and it goes back to IQC for final decision.

05:32:59.585 --> 05:33:13.495
But in November, we will be getting from IQC the recommended list of materials for K-8 science, and then that will be the day that we also kind of look at the history of five years, where we are in the implementation.

05:33:13.815 --> 05:33:16.677
So just to let you know and remind you that we'll be doing that as well.

05:33:17.397 --> 05:33:20.440
The credentialing commission met beginning of August.

05:33:20.941 --> 05:33:24.024
I just want to highlight the special ed focus is still a highlight.

05:33:24.564 --> 05:33:28.348
Kristen Wright, our director of special ed, and her team were there.

05:33:29.309 --> 05:33:40.300
And we're looking at some updated kind of approach to special ed, pretty much generally a common core of training and what they call a common trunk for all teachers and then

05:33:40.720 --> 05:33:44.162
branches out for special ed or for content areas that we need.

05:33:44.483 --> 05:33:52.188
So with that, we have a new title for education specialist credentials, mild to moderate support and extensive support.

05:33:52.368 --> 05:33:55.290
And the special ed department's been working really closely.

05:33:55.710 --> 05:33:58.752
There'll be new program standards.

05:33:59.393 --> 05:34:08.879
You'll hear more about this, but it's a real strong effort, particularly out of the task force that Dr. Lyndon Darling-Hammond and Mike Kurse actually supported when we had our state special ed task force.

05:34:08.899 --> 05:34:10.440
There'll be a lot more about this, but

05:34:11.020 --> 05:34:13.141
We all know the issue with special ed.

05:34:13.261 --> 05:34:14.902
I'm just trying to kind of go fast.

05:34:17.324 --> 05:34:23.347
CPAG was an intensive meeting and that affected our conversation for four hours yesterday morning.

05:34:23.367 --> 05:34:26.649
So anyway, hold on just a minute.

05:34:27.209 --> 05:34:33.093
So starting tomorrow, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Glenn Price and I and some other CDE team

05:34:33.553 --> 05:34:36.495
will be at the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory.

05:34:36.515 --> 05:34:48.902
And this is actually delegations of states like California, Mexico, Oregon, Washington, and countries like Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Sweden, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, and Iceland, actually.

05:34:49.683 --> 05:34:55.512
Anyway, so we're actually coming to a summit on dealing with kind of three areas, and I thought you'd be interested.

05:34:55.532 --> 05:34:57.094
We'll give a report back first.

05:34:57.295 --> 05:35:04.786
Tomorrow we're going to be on a dinner panel talking about the California way and what continuous improvement is and how we've approached it and what our philosophy is.

05:35:05.166 --> 05:35:12.449
dealing with equity, well-being, and inclusion, and leading change, and kind of rethinking the difference between central and local control.

05:35:12.469 --> 05:35:15.510
So that's coming up starting tomorrow in downtown L.A.

05:35:15.990 --> 05:35:19.031
And then next week, there's a Standards Implementation Steering Committee.

05:35:19.091 --> 05:35:24.733
That's a group of the State Board, CDE, and the county offices.

05:35:24.753 --> 05:35:31.376
So that's trying to coordinate all the standards implementation across the state, what's going on, and what our next steps are.

05:35:32.237 --> 05:35:33.798
It's really a good collaborative work.

05:35:33.858 --> 05:35:38.221
And then I'll be joining Bruce in San Francisco for this.

05:35:38.481 --> 05:35:44.466
And then the Concurrence Commission is actually working with CSU, UC, and K-12.

05:35:44.566 --> 05:35:48.389
And next fall, we're going to have a sustainability conference.

05:35:48.409 --> 05:35:50.471
We have our first planning meeting in October.

05:35:50.891 --> 05:35:54.113
But it's all around environmental literacy, public and private schools.

05:35:54.273 --> 05:35:59.757
What can all of our systems, K through higher ed, do to work on sustainability?

05:35:59.797 --> 05:36:05.141
So it's definitely linking all of our levels of education together.

05:36:05.201 --> 05:36:06.662
So I'll be reporting back on that.

05:36:07.282 --> 05:36:07.643
Thank you.

05:36:09.861 --> 05:36:14.347
Well, we had about an hour report this morning, so I won't go on about the workforce pathways.

05:36:14.688 --> 05:36:20.275
However, I want to take this opportunity to bring something up with Member Sandoval around special education.

05:36:20.455 --> 05:36:23.439
And we haven't heard about special ed in a little while.

05:36:23.459 --> 05:36:27.385
I'm wondering if there's a possibility of getting a little report.

05:36:27.725 --> 05:36:32.369
We had heard about SELPAs being part of the statewide system of support.

05:36:33.210 --> 05:36:39.635
In my region, we're experiencing school districts leaving their SELPAs and trying to become their own SELPAs.

05:36:39.895 --> 05:36:43.278
And what does that do with the SELPA system?

05:36:43.418 --> 05:36:49.323
So I'm just kind of curious about that and any... What are we looking at with special education funding these days?

05:36:49.403 --> 05:36:52.805
So it might be helpful to have some kind of an update on special ed.

05:36:54.207 --> 05:36:54.487
Okay.

05:36:56.528 --> 05:36:57.809
Is this set for January?

05:36:58.249 --> 05:36:58.689
Oh, great.

05:36:58.809 --> 05:36:59.150
Okay.

05:36:59.210 --> 05:36:59.530
Very good.

05:37:13.684 --> 05:37:17.729
July 24th and 22nd to the 24th, I went to Denver.

05:37:18.691 --> 05:37:22.155
Code.org invited me to come to their teacher con.

05:37:22.376 --> 05:37:27.363
They have two of them in the summer, one in different cities, one kind of west and one kind of east.

05:37:28.544 --> 05:37:29.666
They provide professional

05:37:30.046 --> 05:37:50.476
their curriculum and professional development for Computer Science Discoveries, which is a grade six to eight course that they've developed, and Computer Science Principals AP, the high school course that they developed, they provide that free of charge, including, this is, I think, the third year they've done that or the second year, including transportation and meals and accommodations.

05:37:51.457 --> 05:37:52.037
And there were

05:37:53.998 --> 05:38:02.546
550, no, there were hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of teachers there, of which 44 were from California, from the Sacramento area.

05:38:03.107 --> 05:38:10.414
So Sacramento County Office of Ed is a regional partner to Code.org, and they're the ones that generated all of the teacher interest in going.

05:38:11.775 --> 05:38:15.558
27 of them took the middle grades professional development.

05:38:15.578 --> 05:38:18.200
17 took the computer science principles of the high school.

05:38:18.840 --> 05:38:27.166
And I was invited for the first couple of days just to walk around and observe and hear the teachers talk about it and see what they were learning.

05:38:27.586 --> 05:38:35.833
And then Code.org also arranged a special luncheon on day two of just the California group and me.

05:38:36.613 --> 05:38:41.439
giving them an update on California state policy on computer science and answering their questions.

05:38:41.899 --> 05:38:42.720
So that was fun.

05:38:42.981 --> 05:38:52.172
And then at the end of this month, on September 27th, 28th, the National California Science, no, not National California, CSTA,

05:38:52.692 --> 05:38:53.953
I've got two CSDAs.

05:38:54.274 --> 05:39:06.744
Yeah, I always revert automatically to California Science, but it's the National Computer Science Teachers Association combined with Code.org is having their third state leaders policy convening.

05:39:07.104 --> 05:39:08.205
This year it's in Denver.

05:39:08.446 --> 05:39:11.808
That's for a 24-hour period plus the travel time.

05:39:12.769 --> 05:39:16.052
And I'm invited to that, paying my own way to that.

05:39:17.284 --> 05:39:25.190
But I might want to renegotiate that because they have asked me to do a presentation on some of the people there.

05:39:25.230 --> 05:39:37.558
There's going to be hundreds of people there from almost every state, including some other state board members, but also people who want to talk, educators in other states and computer science advocates that want to talk.

05:39:37.978 --> 05:39:41.201
to the state board members in other states about computer science.

05:39:41.621 --> 05:39:48.787
And so they asked me if I would talk about how to get state board members engaged around computer science, what kind of messaging might work with that.

05:39:49.388 --> 05:39:58.776
And last thing related to computer science, I mentioned earlier that we started this journey on computer science when Hadi Partovi came.

05:39:59.516 --> 05:40:05.500
down, and he had only launched his nonprofit organization, Code.org, just for one year when he came down.

05:40:05.880 --> 05:40:10.683
So while we were adopting our standards yesterday, he had been invited.

05:40:11.123 --> 05:40:13.485
This is how big the movement has gone.

05:40:13.845 --> 05:40:27.573
He had been invited by the G20 Summit in Argentina to come and speak to all the education ministers there, which represent over 70% of the students in the world, to talk with them about how the world is changing

05:40:27.933 --> 05:40:30.217
and the importance of computer science education.

05:40:30.758 --> 05:40:34.805
So he started with us, okay, and then that's a pretty big deal.

05:40:35.005 --> 05:40:41.275
So I sent him a picture of the group of us outside holding the resolution and he sent me a picture of him at the G20 summit.

05:40:42.513 --> 05:41:07.912
So that's what I've been doing and having lots of conversations, obviously, on charter stuff and ACCS and also talking a lot to the teachers, the California Teachers Association, who is very interested, of course, in that placeholder for the NGSS results on the dashboard and interested in hearing that we are likely to have a large segment of time devoted in November to NGSS and what's been happening.
