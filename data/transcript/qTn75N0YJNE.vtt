WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.680
ready. Good afternoon. Welcome to Preventive Medicine Grand Rounds for November 3, 2021.

00:09.680 --> 00:14.640
I'm Antonio Neri from the Division of Scientific Education and Professional Development. The

00:14.640 --> 00:20.160
Preventive Medicine Grand Rounds is sponsored by the CDC Preventive Medicine Residency and Fellowship,

00:20.160 --> 00:25.200
as well as the Health Resources and Services Administration Bureau of Health Workforce.

00:26.000 --> 00:33.280
The PMRF at CDC provides 12- and 24-month full-time longitudinal service learning

00:33.280 --> 00:39.120
opportunities with senior public and population health leaders for physicians, veterinarians,

00:39.120 --> 00:44.720
and nurses who have completed the CDC Epidemic Intelligence Service Program or have equivalent

00:44.720 --> 00:49.680
public health experience. We use Zoom, as you can see, for the audio and presentation,

00:49.680 --> 00:53.840
and the question and answer box to pose questions. Note that you can pose questions

00:53.840 --> 00:57.920
via the question box at any point during the lecture, and those speakers will answer them

00:57.920 --> 01:03.440
at their discretion. Note that your name may be associated with the question you pose. If

01:03.440 --> 01:07.280
you do not wish your name to be associated with the question, then please check the

01:07.280 --> 01:13.680
submit anonymously box on your question. Continuing education credits are available

01:13.680 --> 01:18.560
for the live course for up to one month after the presentation date, and for the recorded version,

01:18.560 --> 01:24.720
up to two years from the date of presentation through the CDC Training and Continuing Education

01:24.720 --> 01:35.120
Online Portal. The course code to access these ground rounds is all-capital letters, C-D-C-P-M-R-F.

01:35.120 --> 01:43.520
Again, all capitals, C-D-C-P-M-R-F. If you have questions, please contact myself, Antonio Neri,

01:44.400 --> 01:51.200
or email the program at prevmed.cdc.gov. Please remember that the views presented by the speaker

01:51.200 --> 01:55.760
are theirs alone and do not represent CDC, the Department of Health and Human Services,

01:55.760 --> 02:01.440
or the U.S. Government. Before we start our grand rounds, we'll take our usual moment of silence

02:01.440 --> 02:07.040
for our friends, family, and colleagues who have suffered from COVID or even passed away.

02:13.520 --> 02:28.720
Okay. Today's grand rounds will be entitled, Introduction to Tribal Public Health Infrastructure

02:28.720 --> 02:40.080
and CDC by Captain Karen Heard, who is with the Centers for Disease Control Center for State,

02:40.080 --> 02:44.640
Local, Tribal, and Territorial Support. Captain Heard, the floor is yours. Take it away.

02:45.920 --> 02:51.680
Good afternoon, and thank you for allowing me the time to share with you this presentation about

02:51.680 --> 03:01.440
tribal public health infrastructure and CDC. So, as was shared, I am Captain Karen Heard,

03:01.440 --> 03:06.640
and I'm a citizen of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, and I'm coming to you today from

03:06.640 --> 03:10.800
the Choctaw Reservation in Oklahoma. Next slide, please.

03:15.120 --> 03:21.120
The learning objectives for today's presentation include develop more awareness and knowledge of

03:21.120 --> 03:28.160
the diversity of American Indian Alaskan Native populations, identify historical laws that greatly

03:28.160 --> 03:35.600
impact American Indian Alaskan Native populations, understand how AIAN populations are unique to

03:35.600 --> 03:43.440
public health, develop awareness of partners that contribute to AIAN public health, understand how

03:43.440 --> 03:50.560
CDC supports tribal public health infrastructure, and learn about CDC Office of Tribal Affairs and

03:50.560 --> 03:56.800
Strategic Alliances and their collaborations and work with American Indian Alaskan Native populations.

03:56.800 --> 03:57.760
Next slide, please.

04:03.520 --> 04:09.680
So, as an introduction for my office, the Office of Tribal Affairs and Strategic Alliances,

04:09.680 --> 04:17.040
or OTASA, we reside within CDC's Center for State, Tribal, Local, and Territorial Support,

04:17.040 --> 04:23.360
or CSTLTS. CSTLTS works to improve community health outcomes by strengthening state,

04:23.360 --> 04:27.600
tribal, local, and territorial health agencies. Next slide, please.

04:32.960 --> 04:39.280
This organizational chart highlights CSTLTS leadership. In the middle of the chart,

04:39.280 --> 04:45.760
you see our Director, Dr. Jose Montero, and the Acting Deputy Director, Dr. Andrea Young.

04:46.320 --> 04:53.200
You also see the OTASA office that I direct depicted on the left. Next slide, please.

04:53.360 --> 05:02.880
OTASA's mission is to affirm the government-to-government relationship

05:02.880 --> 05:09.520
between CDC and American Indian and Alaskan Native tribal nations by advancing connections,

05:09.520 --> 05:16.000
providing expertise, and increasing resources to improve tribal communities' public health.

05:16.000 --> 05:16.960
Next slide, please.

05:16.960 --> 05:29.280
OTASA works closely with American Indian and Alaskan Native communities to coordinate activities,

05:29.280 --> 05:36.400
provide expertise, technical assistance, and resources. As CDC's principal point of contact

05:36.400 --> 05:41.360
for American Indian and Alaskan Native tribal nations and tribal-serving organizations,

05:41.440 --> 05:48.000
OTASA works to connect tribal nations, tribal-serving organizations, and other stakeholders

05:48.000 --> 05:56.000
to CDC and the Agency for Toxic Substances Disease Registry, or ATSDR, programs. We ensure that

05:56.000 --> 06:00.160
American Indian and Alaskan Native communities receive public health services that keep them

06:00.160 --> 06:05.360
safe and healthy, and we provide and facilitate funding for building and improving cross-cutting

06:05.360 --> 06:08.560
tribal public health infrastructure. Next slide, please.

06:12.560 --> 06:19.440
Before we discuss public health infrastructure, it's important to first note the vast diversity

06:19.440 --> 06:27.360
of American Indian and Alaskan Native communities. There are currently 574 federally recognized

06:27.360 --> 06:33.920
tribal nations across the United States. Each tribal nation is unique in their history,

06:33.920 --> 06:40.960
cultural practices, and traditions. Moreover, tribal nations range in capacity of public health

06:40.960 --> 06:47.360
workforce as well as the tribal public health departments and population size of the tribal

06:47.360 --> 06:53.920
nations themselves. Tribal nations can range in size from some California rancherias of less than

06:53.920 --> 07:03.040
one acre to the Navajo Nation at more than 17 million acres. Tribal sovereignty refers to the

07:03.040 --> 07:09.600
rights of American Indian and Alaskan Natives to govern themselves. Each tribal nation also differs

07:09.600 --> 07:15.360
in their own laws and policies. As sovereign nations, the federal government has a government

07:15.360 --> 07:21.040
to government relationship with each tribal nation to uphold. Next slide, please.

07:26.320 --> 07:32.800
When understanding public health infrastructure for American Indian and Alaskan Native populations,

07:32.880 --> 07:39.760
it is important to first understand a few key historical federal Indian laws that greatly

07:39.760 --> 07:46.000
impact tribal nations and American Indian Alaskan Native populations. Next slide, please.

07:51.200 --> 07:59.200
We will start with the Federal Indian Removal Act of 1830. This federal policy authorized President

07:59.200 --> 08:06.400
Jackson the right to make land exchanges by forcibly removing the five tribes Cherokee,

08:06.400 --> 08:14.240
Muskogee Creek, Chickasaw, Mai Tribe, Choctaw, and Seminole from their ancestral lands against

08:14.240 --> 08:20.960
their will. Over the next several decades, more than 40 tribes were removed to Indian country,

08:20.960 --> 08:28.560
an area that now comprises the state of Oklahoma. President Jackson rationalized the removal program

08:28.560 --> 08:34.640
as a benevolent effort that gave American Indians one last chance to assimilate and

08:34.640 --> 08:41.360
give up their culture. And President Andrews Jackson addressed to Congress, he told lawmakers,

08:42.080 --> 08:48.000
surrounded by our settlements, these Indians have neither the intelligence, the industry,

08:48.000 --> 08:53.120
the moral habits, nor the desire of improvement, which are essential to any favorable change in

08:53.120 --> 08:58.960
their condition. Established in the midst of another and superior race and without appreciating

08:58.960 --> 09:04.720
the causes of their inferiority or seeking to control them, they must necessarily yield to the

09:04.720 --> 09:13.280
force of circumstances and ere long disappear. The Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, which was

09:13.280 --> 09:20.320
proclaimed on February 24, 1831, between the Choctaw and the United States, is the treaty

09:20.320 --> 09:28.800
that brought my family to Oklahoma, where I live today. About 17,000 Choctaws started the journey

09:28.800 --> 09:36.480
from Mississippi to Oklahoma, and it's estimated that nearly a third died along the way from

09:36.480 --> 09:46.640
starvation, exposure, and disease. Today, though, we claim over 200,000 Choctaw Nation citizens.

09:46.640 --> 09:55.600
I wanted to just take a chance and share briefly a personal experience that I have related to the

09:55.600 --> 10:04.320
removal route and the journey. So in June of 2012, I had the honor of participating with a small group

10:05.120 --> 10:11.120
from the University of Washington's Indigenous Wellness Research Institute and the Choctaw Nation

10:11.120 --> 10:18.640
of Oklahoma, re-walking the historical Trail of Tears. The project was named Jopali, and in the

10:18.640 --> 10:27.120
Choctaw language, Jopali means to walk slowly and softly. The goal of the walk as a pilot project

10:27.120 --> 10:33.360
was to connect culturally with the space to discuss and pledge to the health of future Choctaw

10:33.360 --> 10:37.600
generations. We began and ended the day with cultural teachings and really reflected on our

10:37.600 --> 10:45.600
diet and exercise. Prior to this walk, I had gained some weight and wasn't in great shape, so I was

10:46.400 --> 10:52.720
getting kind of in touch with my physical health, and it also presented an opportunity for

10:52.720 --> 11:00.320
participants to make meaningful health changes, and I was able to do that. So I was able to

11:00.560 --> 11:10.400
make meaningful health changes in our own lives. So the removal route is about 500 miles, and so

11:11.680 --> 11:17.600
as we planned for the walk, we had to do a lot of research around the history of the trails,

11:18.240 --> 11:25.920
and that meant that we learned some about our own family's path to Oklahoma.

11:26.560 --> 11:33.360
And I just wanted to share an experience that I had personally during this time. There was a

11:33.360 --> 11:40.080
part in the path that's close to present-day Washington State Park, and that's a recreated

11:40.080 --> 11:49.200
kind of historical site in Arkansas of a town that was there previously, and my family had come

11:49.200 --> 11:56.160
through this area, and for those of you that aren't familiar with Arkansas, there's several

11:56.160 --> 12:04.720
areas that can become very boggy and hard to get through, and my family had come up on this site

12:04.720 --> 12:13.280
and had to wade through water that was kind of up to our shoulders, and a lot of people became

12:13.280 --> 12:20.800
sickened during this time, and even some of the little ones died across this, and so when they

12:20.800 --> 12:25.920
came out of this area, there was a little town, and this town would not allow them to stay,

12:26.640 --> 12:33.120
and so they had to keep walking in a town close to present-day Washington State Park,

12:33.120 --> 12:40.800
allowed them to stay, and fed them, and gave them comfort. And when we re-walked the walk

12:40.800 --> 12:48.560
at this time, I became pretty overwhelmed putting my feet in the soil kind of of my ancestors,

12:49.200 --> 12:58.000
and we were all very tired and worn down at this park at this point in time, and some archaeologists

12:58.000 --> 13:02.720
that were staying at Washington State Park when we walked through invited us to stay the night

13:02.960 --> 13:10.560
fed us a meal and gave us comfort during this time, and it really brought home to me

13:15.760 --> 13:24.480
the meaning of this trail and the sacrifice that our ancestors made for us to keep our tribal

13:24.480 --> 13:32.160
sovereignty and make a new home in Oklahoma. So I just wanted to share that because I think

13:33.040 --> 13:39.840
these stories kind of bring them that, make these experiences more real and bring deeper

13:39.840 --> 13:42.960
understanding. Let's go ahead and go to the next slide please.

13:46.000 --> 13:53.200
So in 1851, the U.S. Congress passes the Indian Appropriations Act, creating the reservation

13:53.200 --> 14:00.560
system to move western tribes onto reservations. The men who created the reservation system believe

14:00.560 --> 14:06.080
that American Indians could be confined to one particular geographical place reserved for them,

14:06.880 --> 14:13.520
they could become civilized and assimilated into American life and transformed into good Christian

14:13.520 --> 14:18.960
farmers. The reservations were established to make sure the remaining tribes converted to

14:18.960 --> 14:24.960
Christianity and became Americanized. Within reservation borders, American Indians were not

14:24.960 --> 14:32.080
allowed to leave except by permission. Those who left were arrested and severely punished.

14:32.080 --> 14:37.440
The federal policies were enforced by Indian agents which suppressed tribal culture and

14:37.440 --> 14:43.200
traditional activities. Treaties were the primary method for creating reservations,

14:43.200 --> 14:50.640
but Congress suspended formal treaty development in 1871. Therefore, executive orders, congressional

14:50.640 --> 14:56.480
acts, or any legal combination recognized by the federal government were used to establish

14:56.480 --> 15:00.400
federal reservations. Go ahead and go to the next slide please.

15:04.800 --> 15:13.840
The General Allotment Act of 1887 is also known as the Dawes Act of 1887. This policy had a

15:13.840 --> 15:21.680
disastrous effect on many tribes. This federal policy was designed to detribalize the American

15:21.680 --> 15:28.080
Indian by destroying the idea of communal land ownership on the reservations. The provisions of

15:28.080 --> 15:33.600
the General Allotment Act include the allotments were held in trust by the U.S. government for 25

15:33.600 --> 15:39.760
years. Eligible American Indians had four years to select their land, but afterwards the selection

15:39.760 --> 15:45.680
would be made for them by the Secretary of the Interior. U.S. citizenship would be confirmed

15:46.880 --> 15:53.040
upon American Indians who abandoned their tribes and adopted the habit of civilized life.

15:53.760 --> 15:58.880
Lastly, all land not allotted were averted to the control of the federal government and can be sold.

15:59.520 --> 16:07.440
Consequently, land owned by American Indians decreased from 138 million acres in 1887

16:07.440 --> 16:18.080
to only 48 million acres in 1934. This act also established the Dawes Roll, which my tribe,

16:18.080 --> 16:24.800
the Choctaw Nation, still uses for descendancy and tribal membership. My great-great-grandmother,

16:24.800 --> 16:32.240
Matilda Harrell, and her son, my great-grandfather, James Harrell, were the original enrollees for my

16:32.240 --> 16:40.880
family. Go ahead and go to the next slide, please. The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934,

16:40.880 --> 16:45.520
also known as the Wheeler-Howard Act, was signed by President Roosevelt on June 18,

16:45.520 --> 16:51.440
1934. This law allows tribes to establish formal governments within limited powers

16:51.440 --> 16:57.680
and allows the formation of corporations to manage tribal resources. So the Indian Reorganization

16:57.680 --> 17:03.680
Act offered federal subsidies to tribes that adopted constitutions like that of the United

17:03.680 --> 17:10.720
States and replaced their government with city council-style governments. Also, American Indians

17:10.720 --> 17:14.560
were given the right to establish a credit system and it granted certain rights of home

17:14.560 --> 17:21.360
rule to American Indians. It provided some vocational education. Also, employment of

17:21.360 --> 17:26.400
American Indian in the Bureau of Indian Affairs was also increased. This act served to give

17:26.400 --> 17:33.440
American Indians a chance at a new deal, quotation marks that ran parallel to many other programs.

17:34.640 --> 17:42.480
Go ahead and go to the next slide, please. In 1953, Congress passes a resolution beginning

17:42.480 --> 17:48.080
federal policy of termination. The image above shows a relocation brochure distributed to

17:48.080 --> 17:54.480
American Indians in the 1950s. A companion policy of relocation moves Indians off reservations and

17:54.480 --> 18:00.960
into urban areas. Through these policies, the BIA planned to move thousands of American Indian

18:00.960 --> 18:08.880
people to cities and urban jobs. The goal really was to absorb American Indians into mainstream society.

18:10.960 --> 18:12.960
Go ahead and go to the next slide, please.

18:17.040 --> 18:22.480
So from some of the key federal Indian laws that we've just discussed,

18:22.480 --> 18:28.080
I would like to now transition in to discuss social determinants of health and how American

18:28.080 --> 18:33.520
Indian Alaskan Native populations might uniquely experience social determinants of health.

18:34.640 --> 18:36.000
Go to the next slide, please.

18:40.320 --> 18:45.760
Historical trauma is the intergenerational collective experience of complex trauma

18:45.760 --> 18:52.160
that was inflicted on a group of people who share a specific group identity or affiliations

18:52.160 --> 18:59.200
such as nationality, religious affiliation, or ethnicity. As discussed earlier, the forced removal

18:59.200 --> 19:05.520
from Native lands because of government policy is one example of historical trauma. Another example

19:05.520 --> 19:10.800
experienced widely across American Indian Alaskan Native population is government policies sending

19:10.800 --> 19:16.320
children to boarding schools, which prohibited speaking Native languages or practicing their

19:16.320 --> 19:23.840
individual spirituality. These policies have caused tremendous impact across multiple generations,

19:23.840 --> 19:29.760
such as loss of Native languages, cultural practices, and loss of Native foods as a result

19:29.760 --> 19:39.280
of loss of land. On November 26, 2019, the President signed Executive Order 13898, forming the

19:39.280 --> 19:45.840
Task Force on Missing and Murdered American Indian Alaskan Natives, also recognized as Operation Lady

19:45.920 --> 19:52.240
Justice. The OLAJ Task Force aims to enhance the criminal justice system and address the legitimate

19:52.240 --> 19:56.720
concerns of American Indian Alaskan Native communities regarding missing and murdered people,

19:57.280 --> 20:04.000
specifically missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. So this task force is a multi-agency

20:04.000 --> 20:09.120
effort that will allow top federal officials to engage, coordinate, and work with tribal governments

20:09.120 --> 20:14.960
on developing strategies to address the crisis by looking at means to collect and manage data

20:14.960 --> 20:21.680
across jurisdictions, establish protocols for new and unsolved cases, establishing multi-jurisdictional

20:21.680 --> 20:28.080
cold case teams, improving response to investigative challenges, and providing clarity on roles,

20:28.080 --> 20:38.080
authorities, and jurisdiction. For CDC, Laura Coller and Dr. Delight Satter represent CDC

20:38.080 --> 20:44.400
on this OLAJ Task Force. Additionally, as we look at social determinants of health,

20:44.400 --> 20:49.680
we see that multi-generational housing is an important consideration when developing

20:49.680 --> 20:55.280
strategies for public health programs. Many American and Alaskan Native populations reside

20:55.280 --> 21:02.880
within multiple generations with youth and elders in the same home. So this has really come to light

21:02.880 --> 21:09.680
when we look at addressing quarantining related to COVID-19 and specific strategies to

21:10.400 --> 21:18.720
protect the elders in the home. Access is another important consideration for Native populations.

21:18.720 --> 21:24.160
Access to food and health care can be difficult due to geographical location alone for some.

21:25.440 --> 21:30.240
In wintertime, especially, some roads can be inaccessible or at times of flooding.

21:31.200 --> 21:36.880
Also, specifically for health care access, the rurality of American and Alaskan Native

21:36.880 --> 21:42.000
communities can cause a provider shortage. Additionally, compared to white residents,

21:42.000 --> 21:48.400
rural AIAN populations were disproportionately concentrated in rural counties that are above

21:48.400 --> 21:55.760
the median for a proportion of their population that lacks health insurance. Additionally,

21:55.760 --> 22:02.640
food insecurity is strongly correlated with malnutrition and underweight as well as obesity

22:02.640 --> 22:09.840
and type 2 diabetes. Sometimes access to vegetables and fruit intake can decline significantly as food

22:09.840 --> 22:15.440
insecurity increases, which can contribute to excess cancer and cardiovascular risk.

22:17.040 --> 22:18.480
Go ahead and go to the next slide, please.

22:18.480 --> 22:28.480
So the American Indian and Alaskan Native people have long experienced lower health status when

22:28.480 --> 22:33.680
compared with other Americans. Lower life expectancy and the disproportionate disease

22:33.680 --> 22:39.520
burden exist perhaps because of inadequate education, disproportionate poverty, discrimination

22:39.520 --> 22:45.120
in the delivery of health services and cultural differences. These are broad quality of life

22:45.120 --> 22:51.440
issues rooted in economic adversity and poor social conditions. American Indians and Alaskan

22:51.440 --> 22:59.760
Natives born today have a life expectancy that is 5.5 years less than the U.S. all races population.

23:01.120 --> 23:08.080
The specific reasons for health disparities are complex and represent much more than who American

23:08.080 --> 23:13.040
Indian and Alaskan Natives are. They also represent where people live and the services available and

23:13.040 --> 23:18.720
accessible to them. Factors such as having a regular source of care, language and communication

23:18.720 --> 23:23.840
barriers, lack of diversity in the health care workforce, high rates of poverty, lack of insurance

23:24.480 --> 23:29.920
coverage, discrimination and large distances from health care services have all added to

23:29.920 --> 23:33.760
the disparities. Go ahead and go to the next slide, please.

23:34.720 --> 23:41.120
It is important to note that although the trauma history that I've shared is a part of the story,

23:41.120 --> 23:48.640
it is just that, a part of the story. Our history is also a history of vast cultural knowledge,

23:48.640 --> 23:56.880
wisdom, ceremony and practices, resilience and survival. Additionally, some tribal nations are

23:56.880 --> 24:02.080
defining their own social determinants of health, and they are also defining their own

24:02.320 --> 24:07.760
social determinants of health, including factors such as cultural identity, family,

24:07.760 --> 24:13.120
participation in cultural activities, access to Native lands and natural resources.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.560
With this in mind, it is important to consider specific cultural strategies

24:18.560 --> 24:23.440
to address public health prevention for American Indian and Alaskan Native populations

24:23.440 --> 24:27.520
as a result of the previously mentioned unique social determinants of health and health

24:27.520 --> 24:33.440
disparities. I want to highlight tribal practices for wellness in Indian country,

24:33.440 --> 24:38.480
which will be discussed in more detail later in the presentation as a key example that supports

24:38.480 --> 24:43.920
tribal practices as a path to prevention and wellness promotion in American Indian and Alaskan

24:43.920 --> 24:50.320
Native communities. A TIPWIC is a four-year cooperative agreement of American Indian and

24:50.320 --> 24:55.760
Alaskan Native tribes and Alaska Native villages or tribally designated organizations that work

24:55.760 --> 25:02.640
with tribes. There's 15 urban Indian organizations receiving a total of approximately 5 million per

25:02.640 --> 25:10.480
year. So the mission of TIPWIC is to encourage and support tribal practices that build resiliency

25:10.480 --> 25:18.080
and connections to community, family and culture. Seven strategies are employed toward this mission.

25:18.880 --> 25:24.480
Connect cultural teachings to health and wellness, support seasonal cultural practices that support

25:24.480 --> 25:29.680
health and wellness, implement social and cultural activities that promote community wellness,

25:30.240 --> 25:36.160
establish and maintain collaborations that strengthen well-being, support intergenerational

25:36.160 --> 25:42.080
learning for well-being and resilience, promote traditional healthy foods and promote traditional

25:42.080 --> 25:48.160
and contemporary physical activities. It's important to note in addressing public health

25:48.160 --> 25:53.040
for American Indian and Alaskan Native population, it's important to build flexibility into the

25:53.040 --> 25:57.680
cooperative agreement or program to allow American Indian and Alaskan Native populations

25:57.680 --> 26:02.240
to bring cultural and traditional adaptations that work individually for their community.

26:02.880 --> 26:10.320
Flexibility per tribal nation is important as not one tribal nation is the same and their

26:10.320 --> 26:15.840
experiences are all different and their traditions and cultural are all unique to them. Next slide,

26:15.840 --> 26:25.680
please. So shifting to looking at public health infrastructure and important partners in Indian

26:25.680 --> 26:30.640
country. So public health infrastructure provides communities, states and the nation with the

26:30.640 --> 26:36.400
capacity to prevent disease, promote health and prepare for and respond to acute threats

26:36.400 --> 26:42.560
and challenges to health. Infrastructure is the foundation for planning, delivering, evaluating

26:42.560 --> 26:48.480
and improving public health and enables the public health system to function including a workforce

26:48.480 --> 26:53.360
training and public health core competencies, information and data systems for rapidly

26:53.360 --> 26:58.080
assessing and communicating information and the ability to respond to public health needs

26:58.080 --> 27:03.760
in culturally responsive and relevant ways. Some tribes look at public health more like community

27:03.760 --> 27:08.640
health where it's an extension to health care services. So in this section we will go into more

27:08.640 --> 27:14.240
detail of tribal public health infrastructure and how CDC works with tribal nations and their

27:14.240 --> 27:19.520
public health infrastructure. This section will also discuss tribal partners in more detail.

27:20.400 --> 27:31.120
Next slide, please. So I wanted to just share briefly the differences between Title I and

27:31.120 --> 27:40.160
Title V, also known as 638. So when we look at Title I, Tribally Contracted Facilities,

27:40.160 --> 27:45.680
they are run by federally recognized tribes or organizations with the IHS to plan, conduct and

27:45.680 --> 27:51.040
administer one or more individual programs, functions, services or activities or portions

27:51.040 --> 27:57.680
thereof that IHS would otherwise provide for Indians because of their status as American

27:57.680 --> 28:04.800
Indian and Alaska Natives. For Title V, Tribally Compacted Facilities, they're run by federally

28:04.800 --> 28:10.320
recognized tribes or tribal organizations with the IHS to assume full funding and control over

28:10.320 --> 28:16.000
programs, services, functions or activities or portions thereof that IHS would otherwise provide.

28:16.800 --> 28:26.880
So my tribe, the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma is a 638. So they have elected to run the full array

28:26.880 --> 28:31.360
of services for the Choctaw Nation. Go ahead and go to the next slide, please.

28:34.960 --> 28:39.840
So both Title V and Title I for tribal administration or programs formerly administered

28:39.840 --> 28:46.720
by IHS, the major difference is a matter of oversight. So under Title V, a tribe may redesign

28:46.720 --> 28:53.360
or consolidate programs, services, functions or activities, also known as PSFAs because we in the

28:53.360 --> 29:00.480
government love our acronyms and reallocate or redirect funding without IHS approval in accordance

29:00.480 --> 29:06.960
with the Indian Self-Determination Education Act. In contrast, IHS must approve any substantial

29:06.960 --> 29:13.920
changes to a Title I contract. The programs aren't not exclusive because tribes can choose

29:13.920 --> 29:21.200
which PSFAs or portions to assume. A tribe may combine Title V, Title I and direct services to

29:21.200 --> 29:26.960
best meet the needs of its communities and Tribal 638 programs are eligible for federally

29:26.960 --> 29:33.040
qualified health center grants at FQHC. Go ahead and go to the next slide, please.

29:35.680 --> 29:41.520
So urban Indians not only share the same health problems as the general American Indian and Alaska

29:41.520 --> 29:47.120
Native population, but their problems may be exacerbated in terms of mental and physical

29:47.120 --> 29:50.960
hardships because of the lack of family and traditional cultural environments.

29:51.760 --> 29:56.480
It is important to understand the different partners that contribute to urban Indian health

29:56.480 --> 30:03.040
as approximately 70% of American Indians and Alaska Natives live in urban areas.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.400
Go ahead and go to the next slide, please.

30:04.400 --> 30:18.480
Urban Indian Health Centers. So these are designated federally qualified health centers

30:18.480 --> 30:23.920
that provide comprehensive primary care and related services to American Indians and Alaska

30:23.920 --> 30:30.400
Natives. The facilities are owned or leased by urban Indian organizations and receive grant and

30:30.400 --> 30:37.440
contract funding through Title V of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. This is a picture

30:37.440 --> 30:44.080
of the Missoula Urban Indian Health Center in Missoula, Montana. Go ahead and go to the next

30:44.080 --> 30:54.880
slide, please. The IHS provides contracts and grants to 41 urban centered nonprofit

30:54.880 --> 31:00.560
urban Indian organizations providing healthcare services at 59 locations throughout the United

31:00.560 --> 31:06.640
States. The 41 programs engage in a variety of culturally appropriate activities to increase

31:06.640 --> 31:13.680
access to health services for urban Indians. The National Council of Urban Indian Health,

31:13.680 --> 31:20.720
or NACUI, is a national nonprofit devoted to the support and development of quality, accessible,

31:20.720 --> 31:26.960
and culturally competent health services for American Indians and Alaska Natives living

31:26.960 --> 31:40.320
in urban settings. Next slide, please. So before we move on to Indian health boards and tribal

31:40.320 --> 31:46.240
epicenters, we have a question in the box. Does OTASTA have resources on which tribes are Title

31:46.240 --> 31:54.160
I versus Title V? Similarly, are these resources on which tribes use BIA police officers compared

31:54.160 --> 32:02.080
to tribal police departments? So this is a complicated question when you are looking at

32:03.040 --> 32:11.360
BIA and police officers and how tribal police departments function. So I would need a little

32:11.360 --> 32:16.960
bit more time to unpack that one, but we do have some resources that we could point you to as far

32:16.960 --> 32:24.400
as Title I versus Title V. And I will share an email at the end of the presentation if you want

32:24.400 --> 32:33.360
to reach out to us. I would be so happy to talk with you about that offline. So let's go to the

32:33.360 --> 32:39.520
Indian health boards and tribal epicenters. So these partners work with tribal nations and urban

32:39.520 --> 32:45.440
Indian health organizations to support and fill in gaps in health care programs and essential

32:45.440 --> 32:48.800
public health services. Go ahead and go to the next slide, please.

32:52.640 --> 33:00.400
Area Indian health boards are nonprofit tribal advisory organizations run and organized by

33:00.400 --> 33:07.200
participating tribes. Most focused on four areas as they pertain to the health of American Indian

33:07.200 --> 33:14.000
Alaska Native people. Health promotion and disease prevention, legislative and policy analysis,

33:14.560 --> 33:18.240
training and technical assistance, and surveillance and research.

33:20.240 --> 33:27.120
You see on the slide that there's 12 regional tribally designated organizations run and

33:27.120 --> 33:33.680
organized by participating tribal nations. So we have the Alaska Native health board for the

33:33.680 --> 33:44.240
Alaska area. And these also are connected to the 12 areas for Indian health service.

33:44.800 --> 33:52.000
As you may or may not be aware, HHS has 10 regions, but Indian health service has 12

33:52.000 --> 33:58.160
areas. So we have the Alaska Native health board, the Albuquerque area Indian health board,

33:58.160 --> 34:04.160
the Great Lakes area tribal health board, Rocky Mountain tribal leaders council,

34:04.960 --> 34:10.240
California rural Indian health board, Great Plains tribal chairman's health board,

34:10.240 --> 34:16.240
Northwest Portland area health board, inner tribal council of Arizona, the Southern Plains

34:16.240 --> 34:22.480
tribal health board, the Navajo Nation Department of Health, and the United South and Eastern tribes.

34:23.200 --> 34:30.000
And this picture depicts the Indian health board of Minneapolis. Go ahead and go to the next slide,

34:30.000 --> 34:40.800
please. Additionally, the national Indian health board or NIHB is a nonprofit organization that

34:40.800 --> 34:46.320
represents tribal governments, both those that operate their own health care delivery systems

34:46.320 --> 34:53.120
through contracting and compacting and those receiving health care directly from IHS. The

34:53.120 --> 34:58.400
area health board serve as member organizations of the national Indian health board and the

34:58.400 --> 35:04.960
communication link between the NIHB and tribes. Member organizations advise in the development

35:04.960 --> 35:10.560
of positions on health policy, planning, and program design. They gather information and

35:10.560 --> 35:15.040
review public opinion and proposals. In areas without an area health board,

35:15.040 --> 35:20.560
the NIHB representative communicates policy information and concerns to the tribes in that

35:20.560 --> 35:31.680
area. Go ahead and go to the next slide, please. Additionally, tribal epidemiology center or TECS

35:31.680 --> 35:36.160
are Indian health service division funded organizations who serve American Indian

35:36.160 --> 35:41.520
Alaska Native tribal and urban communities by managing public health information systems,

35:41.520 --> 35:47.120
investigating diseases of concern, managing disease prevention and control programs,

35:47.120 --> 35:51.440
and responding to public health emergencies and coordinating these activities with other

35:51.440 --> 35:57.680
public health authorities. Each TEC is unique in terms of the types and range of activities

35:57.680 --> 36:03.600
conducted and services offered. There are 12 TECs in total with different missions and activities

36:04.240 --> 36:07.440
per their area. Go ahead and go to the next slide, please.

36:12.560 --> 36:18.400
So in this next subsection, we'll provide details on federal agencies and how they partner with

36:18.400 --> 36:23.680
tribal nations, including a few highlights of projects supporting public health infrastructure

36:23.680 --> 36:30.000
in Indian country. Most federal work with American Indian Alaska Native tribal nations and urban

36:30.000 --> 36:37.680
American AIA and individuals flows from two federal departments, Department of the Interior

36:37.680 --> 36:42.080
and Department of Health and Human Services. Go ahead and go to the next slide, please.

36:48.240 --> 36:55.600
Key federal partners working with tribal nations include the Department of Interior. The BIA is

36:55.600 --> 37:01.520
the oldest agency of the U.S. Department of Interior. The BIA carries out its core mission

37:01.520 --> 37:08.000
to serve the federally recognized tribes through four offices, the Office of Indian Services.

37:10.720 --> 37:17.920
That office operates BIA's general assistance, disaster relief, Indian child welfare, tribal

37:17.920 --> 37:24.400
government, Indian self-determination, and reservation roads programs. When I first started

37:24.400 --> 37:30.160
my career, I'm a licensed clinical social worker by training. I started out at a small clinic in

37:30.160 --> 37:37.840
Wewoka, Oklahoma, and I worked closely with this office related to general assistance and Indian

37:37.840 --> 37:44.480
child welfare. The Office of Justice Services directly operates or funds law enforcement,

37:44.480 --> 37:51.360
tribal courts, detention facilities, or on federal Indian lands. The Office of Trust Services works

37:51.360 --> 37:55.600
with tribes and individual American Indian and Alaska Natives in the management of their trust

37:55.600 --> 38:03.760
land assets and resources. And finally, the Office of Field Operations oversees 12 regional offices

38:03.760 --> 38:11.280
and 83 agencies which carry out the mission at the Bureau at the tribal level. We also have the

38:11.280 --> 38:17.920
Bureau of Indian Education. It provides education services from early childhood through life in

38:17.920 --> 38:23.440
accordance with the tribe's needs for cultural and economic well-being. Within the Department of

38:23.440 --> 38:28.400
Health and Human Services, the public health service agencies include Indian Health Service,

38:29.040 --> 38:34.240
and IHS is responsible for providing federal health care services to American Indians and

38:34.240 --> 38:42.240
Alaska Natives. IHS, as I shared before, has 12 area offices and 170 IHS and tribally managed

38:42.240 --> 38:48.560
service units. The Food and Drug Administration ensures that food is safe and pure and wholesome.

38:49.600 --> 38:54.640
The Health Resources and Services Administration provides health care to people who are geographically

38:54.640 --> 39:00.160
isolated economically, medically vulnerable. The National Institutes of Health supports

39:00.160 --> 39:07.280
biomedical and behavioral research. And the Substance Use Mental Health Services Administration

39:07.280 --> 39:12.320
improves access and reduces barriers to high quality effective programs and services

39:12.960 --> 39:19.680
for individuals who may suffer or are at risk of addictive and mental health disorders. And of

39:19.680 --> 39:25.120
course, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Go to the next slide, please.

39:29.520 --> 39:33.600
So I wanted to shift gears just a little bit and share with you

39:34.560 --> 39:42.160
the Tribal Behavioral Health Agenda. So an example, this is an example really of how

39:42.160 --> 39:46.880
agencies are collaborating with tribes. So the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services

39:46.880 --> 39:51.920
Administration or SAMHSA and Indian Health Service worked with the National Indian Health Board

39:51.920 --> 39:57.280
to gather input from tribal leaders and other relevant partners to develop the National Tribal

39:57.360 --> 40:05.760
Behavioral Health Agenda. So the TBHA, it's not a strategic plan. It's rather a guiding blueprint

40:05.760 --> 40:12.240
that will assist in strengthening policies and programs, aligning disparate resources and

40:12.240 --> 40:18.560
facilitating collaboration. It identifies existing strategic plans and efforts that can serve

40:18.560 --> 40:26.240
as initial pathways for action. And as a single unifying tool, which engaged partners, it can

40:26.240 --> 40:34.400
gather utilizing common language and priorities. And I know several tribal citizens that worked

40:34.400 --> 40:38.800
on this Tribal Behavioral Health Agenda and it was really a labor of love for them.

40:40.080 --> 40:45.680
It addresses five foundational elements, historical and intergenerational trauma,

40:45.680 --> 40:51.520
national awareness and visibility, social ecological approaches, prevention and recovery

40:51.520 --> 40:58.240
supports, and behavioral health services and systems improvement. It really works to provide

40:58.240 --> 41:03.280
a clear national statement about the extent of behavioral health related problems and their

41:03.280 --> 41:09.280
impact on the well-being of tribal communities. It identifies the foundational elements that I

41:09.280 --> 41:14.320
shared. It also provides actions that tribal, federal, state, and local governments in the

41:14.320 --> 41:18.560
private sector should consider based on evidence and practice-based strategies.

41:18.560 --> 41:23.280
It elevates priorities for actions that could or are likely to contribute to meaningful progress

41:23.280 --> 41:27.920
and tackling persistent behavioral health problems for Native youth families and communities.

41:27.920 --> 41:33.360
And it guides the development of strategies that over time more cohesively address factors that

41:33.360 --> 41:39.920
contribute to improved emotional health. And there's a link here to the Tribal Behavioral

41:39.920 --> 41:46.400
Health Agenda if you have an interest in reading it more fully. Next slide, please.

41:49.200 --> 41:57.920
So, I have a question that says, might you be aware or know the status of the Office of Minority

41:57.920 --> 42:02.640
Health's initiative to create a Center for Indigenous Innovation and Health Equity Center?

42:03.520 --> 42:11.840
Yes, I am aware of this. I attended a listening session last week about the creation of the Center

42:12.560 --> 42:18.960
on the Office of Minority Health website. There should be slides from that listening

42:18.960 --> 42:24.960
session that can give you more information if you have interest. I know they are also

42:24.960 --> 42:33.280
recruiting elected tribal leaders to serve on their newly formed Tribal Advisory Committee.

42:33.280 --> 42:40.640
So, they are asking for help to publicize that as well. And reference the recording of this webinar,

42:40.720 --> 42:46.400
I am not sure. I know it's being recorded and we can address that at the end of the session.

42:47.680 --> 42:55.840
So, as we shift gears, the CDC has several projects related to tribal public health

42:55.840 --> 43:03.680
infrastructure. I wanted to talk about these projects now that I've explained and discussed

43:03.680 --> 43:08.880
historical factors and components of health in tribal communities. I'm going to highlight

43:08.880 --> 43:14.960
a few of these projects supporting public health infrastructure. Please understand that

43:14.960 --> 43:19.760
in this limited time, this is not an exhaustive list of projects as supporting tribal public

43:19.760 --> 43:25.680
health infrastructure. Just trying to give a few highlights. Go ahead and go to the next slide,

43:25.680 --> 43:36.000
please. Direct funding of American Indian and Alaska Native tribes and organizations.

43:36.880 --> 43:43.280
Direct funding allows tribal nations to compete with agencies of similar infrastructure. States

43:43.280 --> 43:49.520
get direct funding for many public health issues and tribal nations must rely on states to pass

43:49.520 --> 43:55.840
funding down through them. Moreover, funding that is specific for tribal nations but also

43:55.840 --> 44:04.080
allow more flexibility to account for cultural and traditional best practices. CDC ATSDR currently

44:04.080 --> 44:09.040
has multiple direct funding opportunities to tribal nations and tribally designated

44:09.040 --> 44:14.480
organizations that help support public health efforts and support capacity building in Indian

44:14.480 --> 44:21.280
country. Listed on this slide are some examples of funding to tribes and tribal organizations.

44:21.280 --> 44:26.720
I'll talk a bit more about each of these funding mechanisms throughout this section. Go ahead and

44:26.720 --> 44:36.160
go to the next slide, please. I mentioned the tribal epicenters a little bit earlier in the

44:36.160 --> 44:44.400
presentation. The tribal epidemiology center public health infrastructure or tech fee is a CDC

44:44.400 --> 44:50.160
cooperative agreement that complements Indian health service funding to increase the tech's

44:50.240 --> 44:56.240
public health capacity and infrastructure. The purpose of tech fee is to reduce programmatic

44:56.240 --> 45:04.240
silos within the techs and expand their ability to perform the seven core functions by building

45:04.240 --> 45:11.280
data infrastructure, increasing staff capacity and establishing partnerships. CDC supports the

45:11.280 --> 45:16.880
12 techs and one network coordinating center. The network coordinating center coordinates the

45:16.880 --> 45:22.960
evaluation of this initiative and provides project organization, logistics and communications across

45:22.960 --> 45:29.440
the techs. Tech fee is a five-year cooperative agreement and the techs receive a total of

45:29.440 --> 45:36.560
approximately 8.5 million per year. Although each of the techs projects are unique, they are all

45:36.560 --> 45:41.520
engaging in the following three key strategies to contribute to overall health for American,

45:41.520 --> 45:45.920
Indian and Alaska Native people nationwide. Strengthening public health capacity and

45:45.920 --> 45:50.560
infrastructure, implementing activities to improve effectiveness of health promotion

45:50.560 --> 45:56.480
and disease prevention, engaging in sustainable activities after the funding cycle ends.

45:57.600 --> 46:03.680
The program intends to reduce chronic diseases and risk factors, reduce disparities in health

46:03.680 --> 46:08.800
outcomes and improve overall health by building public health capacity and infrastructure in

46:08.800 --> 46:13.920
Indian country for disease surveillance, epidemiology, prevention and control of disease,

46:13.920 --> 46:21.760
injury or disability. And you see on this slide where all of the techs are located and

46:21.760 --> 46:27.760
they are within the 12 Indian health service areas. Go ahead and go to the next slide, please.

46:31.520 --> 46:36.880
Tribal practices for wellness in Indian country is a four-year cooperative agreement.

46:37.600 --> 46:43.680
American, Indian, Alaska tribes and Alaska Native villages are tribally designated organizations

46:43.680 --> 46:49.120
that work with tribes and 15 urban Indian organizations receive a total of approximately

46:49.120 --> 46:57.040
$5 million per year. TIPWIC encourages and supports tribal practices that build resiliency

46:57.040 --> 47:03.520
and connections to community, family and culture. Over time, these can reduce risk factors for

47:03.520 --> 47:07.600
chronic disease and promote wellness among American, Indian and Alaska Natives.

47:08.320 --> 47:16.400
The CDC funds 36 tribes and urban Indian health centers through TIPWIC. The TIPWIC strategies

47:16.400 --> 47:22.560
fall into the following three general areas. Health promotion, increased traditional physical

47:22.560 --> 47:29.520
activity, traditional foods and overall healthy living practices. Cultural practices, increased

47:29.520 --> 47:35.520
knowledge and sharing of tribal history and cultural practices. Social and emotional wellbeing,

47:35.520 --> 47:42.080
an increased sense of belonging to tribe, sense of connection to culture and intergenerational

47:42.080 --> 47:49.360
interactions are having a positive impact on wellbeing. And this slide represents the states

47:49.360 --> 48:00.640
where the recipients are located. And as you see, we have recipients at several places on

48:00.640 --> 48:09.920
the map. Go ahead and go to the next slide, please. I now like to talk about good health

48:09.920 --> 48:15.280
and wellness in Indian country. Good health and wellness in Indian country continues to

48:15.280 --> 48:21.600
support healthy behaviors for American, Indian, Alaska Natives and emphasizes strategies to reduce

48:21.600 --> 48:26.880
risk factors in Native communities to attain long-term goals by supporting a coordinated

48:26.880 --> 48:33.680
and holistic approach to healthy living and chronic disease prevention. Work also is going

48:33.680 --> 48:39.840
toward reinforcing the work already underway in Indian country to make healthy choices easier for

48:39.840 --> 48:45.760
American Indians and Alaska Natives. Continuing to support culturally appropriate effective public

48:45.760 --> 48:50.960
health approaches and working with more tribes and extending the program's reach and impact through

48:50.960 --> 48:58.320
tribal organizations, including urban Indian organizations. Long-term goals include reducing

48:58.320 --> 49:05.040
type 2 diabetes, reducing commercial tobacco use, reducing high blood pressure and high blood

49:05.040 --> 49:11.440
cholesterol, increasing the intake of healthy foods and physical activity, and also increasing

49:11.440 --> 49:20.880
breastfeeding. Go ahead and go to the next slide, please. Now I'd like to share a little bit about

49:20.880 --> 49:26.800
the Tribal Public Health Capacity Building and Quality Improvement Umbrella Cooperative Grant,

49:26.800 --> 49:34.640
also known as OT18-1803. This program's purpose is to provide resources for American Indian and

49:34.640 --> 49:40.080
Alaska Native tribal nations and regional American Indian Alaska Native tribally designated

49:40.080 --> 49:45.680
organizations to optimize the quality and performance of the tribal public health system,

49:45.680 --> 49:52.640
including infrastructure, workforce data, and information systems, programs and services,

49:53.200 --> 50:00.000
resources and communication, and also partnerships. Work in these areas will increase the capacity of

50:00.000 --> 50:05.040
Indian country to identify, respond to, and mitigate public health threats and decrease

50:05.040 --> 50:11.360
burden of disease among American Indian and Alaska Natives. This cooperative agreement

50:11.360 --> 50:21.120
is in its fourth year of funding. OT18-1803 strategic areas and proposed activities work

50:21.120 --> 50:27.600
toward addressing eight of the ten essential public health services. Tribal public health system

50:27.600 --> 50:34.080
infrastructure encompassing developing policies, workforce assuring a competent workforce,

50:35.280 --> 50:40.160
tribal public health partnership encompassing mobilizing community partnerships,

50:40.160 --> 50:46.720
tribal public health programs and services linking to care and investigations, tribal public health

50:46.720 --> 50:52.960
resources and communication encompasses informing, educating, and empowering, and tribal data and

50:52.960 --> 51:00.000
information systems evaluating and monitoring health. Go ahead and go to the next slide please.

51:05.200 --> 51:13.200
And on this slide you see our OT18-1803 recipients. This cooperative agreement awards 25 federally

51:13.200 --> 51:18.480
recognized American Indian and Alaska Native tribal nations and regionally tribal designated

51:18.480 --> 51:26.000
organizations. So 14 tribal nations and 11 regional tribal organizations. Go ahead and go to the next

51:26.000 --> 51:39.280
slide please. And here is a map showing the recipients. Wisconsin, Oklahoma, and Washington

51:39.280 --> 51:44.080
states have the most representation. Go ahead and go to the next slide please.

51:50.000 --> 51:58.160
So this slide just shares the funding strategies under OT18-1803. Funding strategy one and funding

51:58.160 --> 52:04.880
strategy two. This cooperative agreement is an umbrella cooperative agreement allowing CDC CIOs

52:04.880 --> 52:10.000
to provide additional project plans to support public health infrastructure through the second

52:10.000 --> 52:16.800
funding strategy. The funding strategy is the base funding providing 22,000 to each recipient

52:16.800 --> 52:20.960
for public health infrastructure under the six strategies mentioned previously.

52:21.680 --> 52:27.440
Recipients receiving the base funding are then eligible for funding strategy two projects

52:27.440 --> 52:34.000
allowing for less competition for direct funding. Funding strategy two was created to maximize CDC

52:34.000 --> 52:39.440
programs priorities and health system needs in Indian country. The funding provides recipients

52:39.440 --> 52:45.520
opportunities for substantial topic specific funding. There are currently six CIOs that have

52:45.520 --> 52:51.280
projects funded under strategy two. Go ahead and go to the next slide please.

52:51.280 --> 53:06.400
So I'd like to share with you now some project examples of OT18-03. The Forest County Potawatomi

53:07.600 --> 53:14.640
community have an agreement for expanding tribal members access to health and wellness resources,

53:15.200 --> 53:20.080
increasing engagement in community events and supporting the involvement of tribal members

53:20.080 --> 53:23.600
and prioritizing and addressing the community's public health needs.

53:24.560 --> 53:29.760
FCPC was able to improve their data and knowledge of their community health by conducting needs

53:29.760 --> 53:35.680
assessments while also improving the recipient's outreach to their community. FCPC has enrolled

53:35.680 --> 53:41.040
tribal members and their family affiliates in the managed well health system and has been better

53:41.040 --> 53:45.760
able to understand the health and concerns of the community through biometric screenings and health

53:45.760 --> 53:50.480
assessments as part of their enrollment. I'm going to pause here and plug in my headphones,

53:50.480 --> 54:05.920
stand by. My headphones said they have had too much talking so thank you for that. So the Rocky

54:05.920 --> 54:10.960
Mountain Tribal Leaders Council is supporting a public health workforce expansion in Indian

54:10.960 --> 54:17.360
Country project modeled after CDC's public health associate program. They partnered with

54:17.360 --> 54:24.080
seven tribal colleges where students are selected and complete quick impact projects centered around

54:24.080 --> 54:29.120
behavioral health. This initiative to improve the public health workforce for American Indian

54:29.120 --> 54:34.480
and Alaska Natives also successfully developed another position within the recipient's organization

54:34.480 --> 54:40.640
to initiate partnership development amongst colleges. This position has been able to be

54:40.640 --> 54:47.440
sustainable by the recipient for a long-term partnership involvement. And lastly, the public

54:47.440 --> 54:54.160
health accreditation standards. This has multiple recipients. Multiple 1803 recipients are addressing

54:54.160 --> 55:00.080
public health accreditation standards. Standards include development and implementation of

55:00.080 --> 55:05.840
communication plans, community health assessments, strategic planning, community health improvement

55:05.840 --> 55:12.480
plans, and continuity of operation plans as well as data improvement among others. So Chickasaw

55:12.480 --> 55:19.200
Nation has been able to complete the big three. The community health assessment and also the

55:19.200 --> 55:24.560
community health improvement plan and strategic plan and is preparing to officially apply for

55:24.560 --> 55:30.880
PHAB accreditation. Cherokee Nation is working towards re-accreditation and the Gila River

55:30.880 --> 55:35.840
Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, Choctaw Nation, Ho-Chunk Nation, Lummi Nation,

55:35.840 --> 55:41.440
Wabanaki Health and Wellness, and White Earthland of Chippewa Indians are all progressing in PHAB

55:41.440 --> 56:00.320
standards. Go ahead and go to the next slide please. There we go. So through the 1803

56:00.320 --> 56:06.240
cooperative agreement, CDC provides almost 60 million dollars through supplements to an

56:06.240 --> 56:12.480
existing CDC cooperative agreement, tribal public health capacity building and quality improvement.

56:12.480 --> 56:19.600
This includes about 39 million dollars to 12 regional tribal organizations to serve 10

56:19.600 --> 56:25.760
HHS regions and four tribal nations serving populations of 40,000 or more to prevent,

56:25.760 --> 56:32.160
prepare for, and respond to COVID-19 and 12 million dollars to 11 regional American Indian

56:32.160 --> 56:38.400
and Alaska Native tribally designated organizations to build public health capacity during the COVID-19

56:38.400 --> 56:45.600
response and recovery. The OT 1803 cooperative agreement acted as an already existing funding

56:45.600 --> 56:51.600
mechanism to rapidly provide COVID-19 supplemental funding to regional organizations in response to

56:51.600 --> 56:57.520
the pandemic. The CDC ATSDR tribal advisor committee that will be discussed in more detail

56:57.520 --> 57:02.880
later has requested continued funding and expansion of recipients for this cooperative agreement.

57:02.880 --> 57:08.880
A new umbrella NOFO is expected in 2023. Go ahead and go to the next slide please.

57:12.240 --> 57:18.240
The Supporting Tribal Public Health Capacity in Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Grant or OT

57:18.240 --> 57:29.360
20 2004. In addition to the already existing funding mechanism OT 1803, CDC developed a new grant

57:29.360 --> 57:35.520
to provide COVID-19 funding direct to tribal nations and organizations. This is a non-competitive

57:35.520 --> 57:44.560
grant that provides funding to 346 tribal recipients. This includes 290 tribal nations,

57:44.560 --> 57:51.760
25 tribal consortia, and 31 tribal organizations which reach more than 490 tribes

57:51.760 --> 57:58.880
and more than 39 million individuals according to grantee self-report. Go ahead and go to the next

57:58.880 --> 58:06.800
slide please. Additionally, the Strengthening Public Health Systems and Services through

58:06.800 --> 58:12.320
National Partnerships to Improve and Protect the Nation's Health Cooperative Agreement or OT

58:12.320 --> 58:18.480
18 1802. The purpose of this initiative is to strengthen the nation's public health

58:18.480 --> 58:23.680
infrastructure, ensure a confident current and connected public health system, and improve the

58:23.680 --> 58:29.440
delivery of 10 essential public health services through capacity building assistance. The program

58:29.440 --> 58:35.120
strategies include strengthening the capacities of public health systems infrastructure, leadership,

58:35.120 --> 58:41.680
and workforce, data and information systems, communication and information technology,

58:41.680 --> 58:47.920
partnerships, law and policies, and programs and services. Partners will deliver capacity

58:47.920 --> 58:53.920
building assistance through technical assistance, training, information, sharing, technology

58:53.920 --> 59:00.400
transfer, materials development, or funding that enables organizations to serve customers better

59:00.400 --> 59:07.040
and operate in a comprehensive, responsive, and effective manner. Organizations working on

59:07.040 --> 59:11.360
tribal-related projects who received awards through this cooperative agreement include,

59:11.360 --> 59:17.280
but are not limited to, the National Council of Urban Indian Health NACUI, the National Indian

59:17.280 --> 59:24.880
Health Board, NIHB, and the National Network of Public Health Institutes. Next slide please.

59:30.880 --> 59:36.480
I want to shift just a minute and talk about working with tribal nations training.

59:37.440 --> 59:43.840
This training was created by NIHB with funding and support from the Center for Disease Control

59:43.840 --> 59:50.960
and Prevention, CDC. The Working with Tribes training course is part of NIHB's aim to increase

59:50.960 --> 59:55.920
familiarity with tribes throughout all levels of government, elevate tribal health care and

59:55.920 --> 01:00:00.880
public health needs, and improve non-tribal government employees' familiarity and comfort

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:06.880
with working with tribes. The training module was created using input from area Indian health boards

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:12.480
and other tribal partners, CDC staff, and other federal staff and non-tribal stakeholders.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:18.560
The training underwent two rounds of pilot testing and review prior to the public release.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:24.080
It may also be useful for other professionals such as those who are working with tribal leaders or

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:29.200
conducting consultation activities. Additionally, the first module of the course provides general

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:33.920
information on the impacts of colonization and historical trauma on tribal nations.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:39.280
That may be more widely useful for those who want to learn more about the experience of

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:45.920
this nation's indigenous peoples. You can access this training if you have interest on the NIHB's

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:50.640
website. Go ahead and go to the next slide please.

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:59.840
Racial misclassification of American Indian and Alaska Native people in dangerous lives.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:05.120
It marginalizes American Indian and Alaska Native people and leaves the organizations that serve

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:12.320
them without sufficient data to make decisions or fund the services they provide. This report

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:18.880
examines the problem of racial misclassification on death certificates with a particular focus on

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:25.600
the role of funeral directors in urban communities. For over a year, the National Council of Urban

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:31.360
Indian Health investigated possible factors that might create racial misclassification and looked

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:37.440
for solutions to prevent these factors. This document is intended as a broad and introductory

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:43.200
guide for a variety of stakeholders that can help prevent this problem, including funeral directors,

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:48.000
businesses, and industry associations, statisticians, and public health experts,

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:54.400
and policy stakeholders. The report consists of five parts, a review of the vital record

01:01:54.400 --> 01:02:01.040
systems, racial misclassification of deaths, and relevant literature on this topic, a description

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:07.440
of the survey, listening sessions, and interviews conducted by NACUI to learn about funeral director

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:13.280
policies, practices, and experiences, results from these activities, and then a discussion

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:18.960
summarizing what NACUI has learned, and a list of recommendations geared at the prevention of racial

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:25.120
misclassifications on death certificates before it occurs. Go ahead and go to the next slide, please.

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:34.800
The Public Health and Indian Country Capacity Scan, or FICS, the National Indian Health Board

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:39.760
in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the 2019 Public

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:45.520
Health and Indian Country Capacity Scan that provides a comprehensive picture of tribal public

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:51.600
health infrastructure and activities, specifically immunization, screening, and prevention education

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:57.280
activities that are widely occurring in Indian Country. This report describes the current state

01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:02.080
of public health services from a national perspective throughout tribal communities.

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:08.400
The 2019 FICS report serves as a valuable tool for Indian Country to identify needs and strengths

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:13.360
in tribal public health, to measure progress over time, to allocate staff and resources where they

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:19.760
are most needed, and provide data for decision making relative to infrastructure programs and

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:26.080
resources for the system overall. And you find a link on this side to this FICS report if you have

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:34.560
interest. Okay, go ahead and go to the next slide, please. Let me look at some of these questions.

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:55.120
So I had a question that talks about how are policies being socialized with Native American

01:03:55.120 --> 01:04:01.760
communities? Seems there is no knowledge of primary health care. Also, how can I help as an ally?

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:15.040
So my experience is that there has been really a swell of interest in American Indian and Alaska

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:23.040
Native communities and education about primary health care. But a lot of the focus is on primary

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:34.160
health care rather than public health as a whole. And the question said that there was a treaty camp

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:41.600
in Minnesota. I would be very interested to hear more about that. There's a question related to

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:48.640
the five million fixed amount or increase with inflation budget. I'm not really sure which

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:54.720
cooperative agreement or grant that's referring to. Could you describe some of the reasons for

01:04:54.720 --> 01:05:05.840
spotty uptake? So it is difficult for many tribal nations to be able to have the infrastructure,

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:13.760
to be able to apply for cooperative agreements and grants, and then be able to run them. Also,

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:21.040
some of the funding can be a small amount with these particular grants. But it gets

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:28.480
a tribal nation kind of into play in looking at public health and building that infrastructure.

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:34.240
So I think we have to look at ways to support that and then supplemental funding that can

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:42.800
add on to the work that's being done to develop the public health infrastructure for that tribal

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:49.040
nation. The next question is, we know there has been understandable concerns about biomonitoring

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:54.400
within tribes and Native communities in the past. Was this project more successful? If so,

01:05:55.040 --> 01:06:03.600
do you think that was a result of being tribally led? Yes. I think any cooperative agreement or

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:12.320
grant that starts where a tribe is and really focuses on that tribe's needs and supports that

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:21.200
and has flexibility to be tailored to specific tribal needs is always going to be more successful.

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:36.080
As far as to confirm public health services, are tribal public health requirements a success?

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:45.760
Yes, there are requirements by states. I'm sorry, and I apologize. You can't see what I'm reading.

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:49.920
It says to confirm public health services are in agreement with CDC. Are tribal public health

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:58.960
required to submit specific test results as with STIs and with TB? There are some state requirements

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:08.880
that states work with tribes in order to be able to access that information.

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:16.160
Let's see, and where can we find more about the Racial Misclassification Project?

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:28.160
If you email me, I'm at rqj0 at cdc.gov. I will get you those links. So let's see. In our remaining

01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:35.520
time, I'd like to go a little bit into CDC's Tribal Advisory Committee and Tribal Consultation.

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:42.800
Go ahead and go to the next slide. Regarding government-to-government relations,

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:49.840
the CDC ATSDR Tribal Advisory Committee is a key component upholding this relationship.

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:59.120
The Tribal Advisory Committee advises CDC ATSDR on policy issues and broad strategies that may

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:05.600
significantly affect American Indian and Alaska Native communities. The TAC assists CDC ATSDR

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:11.120
in fulfilling its mission to remote health and quality of life by preventing and controlling

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:16.560
disease injury and disability through established and ongoing relationships and consultation

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:24.640
sessions. Maintaining the CDC ATSDR TAC is one of OTAS' roles. The TAC is a committee made up of

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:29.440
elected tribal leaders or their authorized representative. The TAC provides advice and

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:37.840
recommendations to CDC ATSDR in accordance with Executive Order 13175. They meet formally twice

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:42.720
a year through formal public health meetings to discuss American Indian and Alaska Native priorities

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:50.080
and provide feedback on important issues affecting Indian Country. TAC roles include identifying

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:56.960
evolving issues and barriers, proposing clarifications, recommendations, and solutions,

01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:02.880
serving as a forum for tribal nations, and identifying priorities and providing advice.

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:13.040
Go ahead and go to the next slide, please. CDC ATSDR's Tribal Advisory Committee is composed

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:19.440
of elected tribal leaders or their designated authorized representative. So its composition

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:26.000
includes one delegate from each IHS region, and as we showed before, there's 12 of those,

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.760
and four delegates from tribes at large. The Office of Tribal Affairs and Strategic

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:36.720
Alliances, my office, administers the TAC, including implementing and coordinating the

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:45.440
biannual TAC meetings. Historically, those TAC meetings have been one meeting in Atlanta and

01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:52.880
one meeting somewhere in Indian Country. The designated federal official is Dr. Jose Montero,

01:09:52.880 --> 01:10:00.160
who I shared before as the Director for Seastelts. TAC functions and serves as scientific and

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:07.440
programmatic resource. He, CDC ATSDR managers and staff, as determined by the designated federal

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:12.720
official, serve as resources for the TAC as well. Go ahead and go to the next slide, please.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:23.520
CDC ATSDR's Tribal Consultation Policy requires that CDC and ATSDR programs consult with tribal

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:28.560
governments when developing programs, policies, and activities that will affect American Indian

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:35.120
and Alaska Native populations. The goals of this consultation are to assist in eliminating

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:40.240
the health disparities faced by American Indian and Alaska Native tribes, ensuring health equity

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:45.760
for all American Indian and Alaska Native people and communities is attained, maximizing access to

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:50.560
critical health and human services and public health services to enhance the social, physical,

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:57.600
and economic status of American Indian and Alaska Native tribes. Tribal consultation current status.

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:04.240
So we have been hard at work to honor the presidential memorandum that was issued on January

01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:15.200
26, 2021, directing us to take a look at our tribal consultation policy and have consultation

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:21.600
on this policy to see how we might improve it to better meet the needs of the tribal nations that

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:29.600
we serve. So we recently held this tribal consultation on August 5th. We are on track

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:36.480
to provide a formal response and a summary report to the testimonies provided by November 11th.

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:40.880
Go ahead and go to the next slide, please.

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:51.200
So as stated earlier, the CDC ATSDR TAC is made up of tribal leaders from each of the different

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:57.200
IHS areas. While the TAC members can be used as subject matter experts to provide guidance

01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:02.400
on perspectives from each of their respective areas, they are really only able to represent

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:07.280
their specific tribal nation. One tribe cannot speak for another and therefore the TAC really

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:13.280
can't act as a substitute for consultation. One tribal leader commented in a recent consultation

01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:19.120
session that the CDC ATSDR should begin engaging the TAC early in the policy and regulatory making

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:25.920
process so any proposed policies can be tribally informed from the start. Consultation is necessary

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:31.680
once an action such as policy, funding development, program services has been identified that

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:37.920
significantly impacts American Indian and Alaska Native populations or even one tribal nation.

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:44.240
It can occur across all federally recognized tribal nations or just one tribe. Who is in

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:49.840
attendance is dependent on who the policy or issue impacts. It's also important to understand

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:55.440
the difference between consultation and listening sessions. Consultation should occur when a formal

01:12:55.440 --> 01:13:01.440
decision needs to be made on an activity that has a large impact on tribal nations while a listening

01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:07.920
session is to obtain informal guidance during very early stages of a project. Listening sections can

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:13.600
also be used to get guidance on an activity or program that has lower level implications for

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:22.560
tribal nations. Go ahead and go to the next slide please. So moving forward. Next slide.

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:29.680
To summarize the different items we have discussed throughout this presentation,

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:35.680
some important considerations should include direct and continuous funding sources for

01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:41.440
tribal nations to plan for resources ahead of time and have sustainable resources to build

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:48.320
infrastructure and capacity. Improve data access and quality of data to prioritize resources.

01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:55.200
Flexible programs and funding opportunities to account for cultural and traditional practices

01:13:55.200 --> 01:14:00.000
that might be more effective in addressing public health prevention for American Indian

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:06.640
and Alaska Native communities and respect for cultural practices and community ways of knowing.

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:12.240
When working with tribal nations and tribal partners, it is important to include tribal

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:18.960
leaders at the beginning of planning together input on what might be most needed with regards

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:24.880
to that area of public health prevention. Continuously communicating throughout the

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:30.800
development of a project will ensure improved buy-in as well as more effective strategies to

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:36.960
address that population's needs. Lastly, it is important not to make assumptions.

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:43.760
Always listen and when in doubt, ask questions. I want to end this point with a story that I

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:52.160
experienced really early in my career related to making assumptions. I was working with a very

01:14:52.160 --> 01:15:00.320
respected tribal researcher and she shared a story with me about a tribal nation that had reached out

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:08.400
for assistance with trying to turn around the tide on pediatric obesity within their tribe.

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:17.040
The research team went to this tribal nation with some preconceptions about why this was happening,

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:25.760
about what would be needed, and about how to move forward. They started out in the community

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:31.920
sharing these preconceived conceptions and they felt like they weren't getting very far.

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:41.200
And then one day they were at a community center and there was some discussion and some elders

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:51.520
shared that this particular tribe had experienced earlier in their tribal history a very significant

01:15:51.520 --> 01:16:02.720
famine and many people died, especially babies and smaller children. And the babies and smaller

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:11.680
children that had survived had been the heavier kids and this had translated into a value for

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:19.280
heavier children and I perceived that it was their cultural way for children to

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:23.840
be that healthy equals heavier or a heavier weight.

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:31.200
As this was discussed and realized, they realized that this value had not been part of their

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:38.400
original instructions that had been adaptive to what had happened to them. If these researchers

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:43.520
had not talked to the elders of the community, they would have never realized this and they would

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:51.120
have never been able to incorporate this knowledge into their interventions. And surely this issue

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:57.440
was multifactorial, that this was a huge part in the piece of the puzzle that they needed to be

01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:04.400
able to work with this tribe to be able to have effective interventions. So I encourage you as

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:12.000
you work with tribal partners to always have an open listening ear, to have that respect

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:19.120
and have that desire to not make assumptions and answer those questions.

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:20.880
So go ahead and go to the next slide please.

01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:30.480
These are some ways that you can connect with OTASA and Sea Stilts. The

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:41.040
at the tribal page, the cdc.gov backslash tribal has a lot of the documents that I have referenced

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:48.320
here. You can find our TAC charter, you can find our current CDC tribal consultation policy,

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:55.280
you can learn more about our tribal resources. Additionally, if you want to reach out to me

01:17:55.360 --> 01:18:04.560
directly, I'll put my email in the chat box and with that I just go to the last slide please.

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:10.240
I just want to thank you very sincerely. I've been honored to be able to spend this time with

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:19.120
you today and I am so thankful for the work that all of you are doing and OTASA stands ready to

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:22.160
support as you work with tribal nations in any way.

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:32.880
Thank you so much Captain here. I really, really appreciate it. There are a couple of questions in

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:38.400
the Q&A box that have added up but I'd be interested to see, there's one person

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:42.400
that put in a link to the racial misclassification report and there's, I don't know if that's the

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:47.440
but I wanted to get your okay before it approves.

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:51.120
And I have a couple questions if you want to answer the Q&A box. Go ahead.

01:18:55.440 --> 01:19:10.800
So as there's a question, given the unique conditions of Native Hawaiian communities,

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:15.600
is there a mechanism TAC for supporting Native Hawaiian communities in Hawaii?

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:21.680
Noticeably, Hawaii State is linked out in a TAC map. So Native Hawaiians have a different

01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:28.160
relationship with the United States government than the 574 federally recognized tribes.

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:35.200
So the TAC supports that government to government relationship that we have with the 574

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:43.280
federally recognized tribes. I do know that CDC does do some work with Native Hawaiian communities

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:50.320
and works to support those communities as well but they do not have formal TAC representation

01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:55.840
because of that unique government to government relationships for federally recognized tribes.

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:05.680
I have, I'm wondering whether there are general resources available for CDC employees to support

01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:11.600
culturally appropriate engagement with tribal partners? Yes. So if you have interest in

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:19.520
learning more, I would encourage you to go to the NIHB website and take the training that I

01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:26.960
discussed earlier. I can also, I'm so bad at multitasking. I used to be a police dispatcher

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:32.800
way, way back in my career and I could do it all but I can't do it now. So maybe we can get

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:39.440
somebody to drop that in the link, the NIHB website. I would also encourage you to visit

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:46.160
the CDC tribal page. There's a lot of resources there. Additionally, you can always reach out to

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:54.640
OTASA if you have any particular needs and we would be happy to help locate that. Let's see,

01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:59.440
next I have given the data modernization initiatives at CDC. Is there a plan to do

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:04.560
a tribal consultation for that alignment of surveillance data across centers at CDC?

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:10.880
For example, there are often different mechanisms for tribes to share data. So we do have a data

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:19.680
modernization work group that is addressing tribal data as well. I think as these plans

01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:27.520
kind of come together, we have suggested for some listening sessions and tribal consultation

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:33.680
when these plans kind of align. So yes, stand by for that because I believe that those are going

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:42.000
to be next steps coming with that. Let's see. The other question was about the data modernization

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:48.240
initiative that I shared, how are tribal issues being addressed. If you had an opportunity in

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:57.680
August to listen in to our tribal advisory committee, we had one section that was dedicated

01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:04.080
to data modernization issues so that we could hear from the tech about what their experiences

01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:11.920
were. A lot came to light about data related to COVID-19 and how tribes were able to access

01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:18.640
information and respond. And so the stars are aligning in ways I believe that we are going

01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:28.400
to have some movement forward related to DMI. Also, just as an aside, everyone from CDC is

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:34.880
welcome to be in a listening mode on our TAC meetings. Our next TAC is going to be February

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:47.680
2nd and 3rd. If you visit the tribal website that I referenced earlier, you can see registration

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:54.480
so that you can. And those meetings are very, very informative about a variety of issues.

01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:58.320
In August, we talked about public health infrastructure. We talked about social

01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:05.200
determinants of health. We talked about DMI and opioids. I know I'm missing something, but

01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:15.280
the TAC meetings are now being focused to be less CDC presentation and more hearing from the tribal

01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:20.480
leaders. And so I think that has made them a little bit richer as well. Let's see.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:29.040
Are there programs that provide funding to hire tribal members to work on public health issues

01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:35.600
within their own communities? So we have the key health, the public health associates program.

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:46.880
We have really strived to identify more tribal host sites and to encourage recruitment of

01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:54.320
American Indian Alaskan Native PHAPs. Additionally, the AmeriCorps public health program has just

01:23:54.320 --> 01:24:00.240
launched, which tribes are eligible for as well. I would encourage you, if you're working with

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:07.600
tribal nations, to make them aware of these resources because with these AmeriCorps funds,

01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:14.400
they could potentially hire tribal members or American Indian Alaskan Natives to work on these

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:25.920
public health issues in their communities. Let's see. So I believe that that is the end of the

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:32.640
questions. Do you see any that I'm missing? Oh, okay. I want to give a shout out. I see

01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:36.160
not a question, but I just wanted to say that I used to work with Dr. Katie Scheltz, and she

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:44.320
wanted me to let you know that she says hello. So Katie Scheltz was one of the inaugural members

01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:51.120
on our Yachtley Walk in 2012 with Indigenous Wellness Research, and she's a Choctaw by way

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:57.520
of Alaska and one of my very good friends. So please tell Dr. Scheltz I said hello. So good

01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:10.400
to hear from her. I think that's the end of the questions. Are there any other questions? I think

01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:14.560
we have five minutes. Am I reading that right? You're correct. Well, thank you so much for that.

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:19.280
I mean, such a broad-sweeping overview of American Indian Alaskan Native issues in the country

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:25.520
and as well as the past, present, and future. I very much appreciate your work, and I thought

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:30.240
it was especially touching the personal stories you had and how that really made it relatable to

01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:36.080
the activities that occur today and the different things that are going on. I was wondering if you

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:41.600
could talk briefly, and just probably one final question, a little bit about jurisdictions in

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:45.600
Indian country and how those interact, and particularly from the public health realm as

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:51.360
far as county health departments, IHS, BIA, all those folks. And if you can talk briefly about

01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:55.520
that, that's a complex topic, but I think it's a topic our learners don't understand as much.

01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:03.440
Right, and it's a very complicated topic, and it varies from state to state, tribe to tribe,

01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:11.600
county to county. Some tribal nations have established pretty good working relationships

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:16.640
with their county health departments or their state health departments. Others definitely do

01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:24.960
not. We hear from tribes that monies that flow through state health departments that are intended

01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:31.040
to serve American Indian Alaskan Natives sometimes do not end up there or in the way that the tribal

01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:39.360
nations would request them to. We've also heard, especially with the COVID-19 vaccines,

01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:46.720
so tribes had the choice to get their vaccines through Indian Health Service or to go through

01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:55.120
the states for vaccine. Many tribes felt that they should be able to work directly government

01:26:55.120 --> 01:27:02.480
to government with that, or that they should have the choice maybe to do both, and so that added to

01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:10.640
some complexity. Also, additionally, it's difficult because, as I shared, the majority

01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:16.960
of American Indian Alaskan Natives live in urban centers, and so they might be served by a county

01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:22.480
health department. They might be served by an urban Indian organization. So how does that all

01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:31.440
work together? Additionally, as we look at data as well, although many of the sites ask if you're

01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:36.240
American Indian or Alaskan Native, I don't believe any sites are asking, are you Choctaw?

01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:44.320
Are you Cherokee? So then how do tribal nations identify within their data their tribal members

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:50.080
and what services they're getting and how? I had an experience in my own public health department,

01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:55.520
so I get some of my services through Choctaw Nation. I get some of my services through

01:27:55.520 --> 01:28:00.720
the county health department, and when I went for my flu shot, they didn't ask if I was American

01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:04.800
Indian or Alaskan Native. They automatically just looked at me and made an assumption

01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:10.720
and checked why. So I just say, whoa, whoa, wait a minute, you know, check this because I want to be

01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:18.720
represented, right? And so that goes to that misclassification as well. Additionally, so as

01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:25.440
I think public health infrastructure for tribes is, for most tribes, is just very much at the

01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:32.160
beginning, right? Because, you know, county, states have been inventing for a long time for

01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:37.360
public health infrastructure, but there hasn't really been a dedicated funding source for these

01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:44.160
activities for Indian country. And so as they become more robust, like Cherokee Nation, and

01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:50.320
they say state of Oklahoma, we're able to take on these activities for our citizens, then what does

01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:55.440
that mean for funds that come to the state of Oklahoma, and how does that also, I think that

01:28:55.440 --> 01:29:03.600
kind of can be very complicated as well. Plus, if you have a tribe that, say, has 50,000 tribal

01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:08.480
members, then it might be kind of in your best interest to stand that up and have that and be

01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:13.600
able, but if you have a rancheria that, say, has less than 100, you know, are you going to be able

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:19.920
to take on all those essential services? So I think the picture can be very different for

01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:26.240
many, many reasons, and so that's, I think, why, you know, there's still so much work to be left,

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:31.040
left to be done, you know, for, as we stand up, public health infrastructure.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:37.040
Certainly. Well, thank you, Captain Heard. We're at the top of the hour. We very much appreciate

01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:43.440
your time and your efforts in this area. If you're listening, we're going to, for our audience,

01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:47.440
we're going to be back on December 1st. We'll be tentatively talking about big data and large

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:51.200
data analysis. That's open to anybody. It's a publicly available Grand Rounds.

01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:56.400
This is Captain Heard, and we can very much appreciate looking forward to your work in this area.

01:29:57.680 --> 01:29:58.800
Thank you. Thank you. And again,
