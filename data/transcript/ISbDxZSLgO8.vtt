President Darling-Hammond.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Here.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Member Burr.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Here.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
Everyone's present and accounted for.

00:46.000 --> 00:54.000
Okay. We are now reconvening the public session. In closed session, the board discussed following

00:54.000 --> 01:02.000
cases and or took action of the Martinez versus Newsom case and today's fresh start with

01:02.000 --> 01:10.000
Singlewood USD, LACLE, CDE, and SBE. I'm going to start with our announcements. For public

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
input, members of the public wishing to dial in for public comment should view the livestream

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
of the meeting to know at what time we will ask for public comment for each item on the

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
agenda. Public comment may be provided by dialing the phone number and participant access

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
code which will be posted at each of those junctures and then again following each of

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
the operator's prompts. Upon dialing in, callers will be added to a caller queue. The operator

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
will notify callers when it is their turn to provide public comment. We will also ask the

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
public calling in for public comment to please turn down the speaker volume of their computers

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
if they are following the live feed to avoid an echoing effect. Public comment will be

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
limited to one minute for each speaker. Board members, please mute your microphones when

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
not speaking. Keep your cameras on at all times except during the scheduled breaks to

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
ensure that we maintain a forum throughout today's virtual meeting. For each item on the

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
agenda, there will be an opportunity for you as board members to raise your hand using the

02:12.000 --> 02:18.000
participant window if you would like to ask a question or make a comment. And we're going to

02:18.000 --> 02:24.000
begin with item 13. Item 13 is to provide an information overview on the CDE's implementation

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
of assembly bills 1505 and 1507. And this will be specifically as it pertains to the new

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
review standard and process of the State Board of Education and the Advisory Commission on Charter

02:38.000 --> 02:44.000
Schools in the hearing of appeals for the establishment and renewal of charter schools.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
And this item will be presented by Stephanie Farland from the CDE. Good morning Stephanie.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
Good morning. Good to see everyone. Good morning President Darling-Hammond, board members,

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
Chief Deputy Gregson. It's good to be here today. The purpose of this presentation as

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
President Darling-Hammond just mentioned is to provide you with an overview of the impact of

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
assembly bills 1505 and 1507. And we will be emphasizing the SBE's role in the charter

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
appeal process. This is an information item only. So there will be no action today needed or

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
taken by the State Board of Ed. So today's objectives, the focus of our overview today will

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
be general overview of 1505. As you know, there are a lot of components to it. It was a

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
major overhaul of charter school law. So we'll be touching on a lot of the components, the new

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
components, and then focusing a bit of time on just the SBE's role. So we'll be talking about

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
the SBE appeals and review standard, the renewal criteria and performance criteria that is

03:50.000 --> 03:56.000
new under AB 1505, including the consideration of verified data, role of the department, and the

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
ACCS, the new role with appeals under 1505. And we'll also be talking about the requirements for

04:02.000 --> 04:08.000
non-classroom-based schools and treat as continuing charter schools. And we will get into a

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
lot of that detail as we go along today. We'll also be talking about the requirements for

04:14.000 --> 04:20.000
non-classroom-based schools and treat as continuing charter schools. And we will get into a lot of that

04:20.000 --> 04:26.000
detail as we go along today. I will not be the only one presenting today. It's a group effort.

04:26.000 --> 04:32.000
There's a lot of information here to present. I'm sure you saw that in the long PowerPoint.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
So I do have staff from the charter schools division here today, Carrie Lopes and the Kenahue,

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
and our division will be presenting some of the data information.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
So over the course of the last year, I guess it's been a year since the

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
law has been signed, CDE and state board staff have really been laying the groundwork

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
for how 1505 will be implemented here at the department and with the State Board of Education.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
So we have been busy laying that foundation. There are still many components still missing.

05:08.000 --> 05:14.000
And we will talk about some of those as we move along. We've been taking these implementation

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
of 1505 sort of in chunks. There were pieces that needed to be taken care of

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
and done over the course of this last year. So you'll see that

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
we have done a lot. We have implemented a lot, but we still have quite a bit to do.

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
And some of the questions you may have later, some of the definitions and processes

05:38.000 --> 05:44.000
that are outlined in 1505, we may not have answers for today because we're working on regulations

05:44.000 --> 05:50.000
and some of that will come out in January, but we hope to provide as much information as possible today.

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
So implementation efforts.

05:56.000 --> 06:04.000
The department has actually done quite a bit over the last year.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
And it has been a group effort. All of this did not come out of the charter schools division.

06:08.000 --> 06:14.000
It is definitely a department-wide and state board staff-wide work

06:14.000 --> 06:20.000
that has gone into everything that's been done.

06:20.000 --> 06:26.000
So we have, obviously you've seen your SBE information memoranda. We've created one and submitted one in October of 2019

06:26.000 --> 06:32.000
and also in June 2020. And those were just overview memos on 1505.

06:32.000 --> 06:38.000
The department has created a charter schools division newsletter that will go out quarterly.

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
The first one went out a couple of weeks ago. We're very excited about that because it's an opportunity

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
for us to share information in real time with our stakeholders in the field.

06:50.000 --> 06:56.000
We will continue to update and post new information on that, and that can be found on the charter schools website on the CDE page.

06:56.000 --> 07:02.000
We've also posted, in terms of technical support and assistance,

07:02.000 --> 07:08.000
we have posted new forms online that will assist charter schools in submitting appeals to the State Board of Ed

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
and will also be used by the Department of Ed staff to process those appeals.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
We're very excited about those and happy to say that we were able to share those with stakeholders before they were posted to gather any input needed.

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
As I mentioned a moment ago, the department is in the process of developing regulatory language

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
that is presented to the State Board at its January meeting. We have reached out to stakeholders twice in this process.

07:32.000 --> 07:38.000
Once in the spring and again just last week where we held Zoom meetings to solicit feedback from stakeholders

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
on the various components of 1505 that might need regulations.

07:44.000 --> 07:50.000
As part of that stakeholder group were several charter operators, CCSA, CSDC, several district authorizers, including LA Unified,

07:50.000 --> 07:56.000
and several counties of offices of education, CTA, and other union organizations.

07:56.000 --> 08:02.000
We had a very diverse group of stakeholders and we received some very thoughtful feedback,

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
which we will be reviewing as we continue to write regulatory language.

08:08.000 --> 08:14.000
Oops, I skipped over, didn't need to.

08:14.000 --> 08:20.000
The new requirement of the verified data list and aggregate enrollment data under 1505 is,

08:20.000 --> 08:26.000
well you'll hear the verified data item in the next item,

08:26.000 --> 08:32.000
but we do have a new requirement that allows chartering authorities to request from the Department of Ed

08:32.000 --> 08:38.000
aggregate data reflecting pupil enrollment patterns of a charter school for purposes of renewal.

08:38.000 --> 08:44.000
This information may be used to support a determination as to whether the charter school is serving all pupils who wish to attend

08:44.000 --> 08:50.000
and identifying evidence to support the finding.

08:50.000 --> 08:56.000
Part of that data that can be requested is already posted on our website and we have also sent several authorizers

08:56.000 --> 09:02.000
the remaining enrollment data that needs to be requested.

09:02.000 --> 09:08.000
This is ongoing right now. If authorizers have charters going through the renewal process,

09:08.000 --> 09:14.000
they can request from the Department of Ed the aggregate enrollment data from those charters and the department will send it to them.

09:14.000 --> 09:20.000
So that's very exciting and that took a lot of work from our AMARD group to get that together,

09:20.000 --> 09:26.000
and that is live.

09:26.000 --> 09:32.000
As I mentioned earlier, stakeholder engagement opportunities, we have been engaging stakeholders.

09:32.000 --> 09:38.000
We, as I said, engage them twice for the regulatory process,

09:38.000 --> 09:44.000
and we also have had several meetings, several stakeholder meetings for the verified data process,

09:44.000 --> 09:50.000
which we'll go into more detail about that in the next item.

09:50.000 --> 09:56.000
We've been sending out some of our postings beforehand to stakeholders to make sure that

09:56.000 --> 10:02.000
we're getting it right and that what we're putting out is useful for charters and authorizers in the state.

10:02.000 --> 10:10.000
And so we've been very, very happy that stakeholders have been willing to be engaged in this process.

10:10.000 --> 10:16.000
And then in terms of the implementation of tracking of the bill,

10:16.000 --> 10:22.000
the bill does require that we track how the bill is being implemented in the field

10:22.000 --> 10:28.000
and how it's being implemented up here at the state level, and we continue to have conversations

10:28.000 --> 10:34.000
here within the department and across the street in the legislature around those issues.

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
So AB 1505, as I said, will impact various aspects of charter school law.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
And there are some areas that we're going to get into today,

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
such as charter school establishments and renewals, charter school appeals,

10:54.000 --> 11:02.000
the role of the ACCS, which has been changed and will be discussed further in further detail in the presentation.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
Geographic site and site limitations.

11:06.000 --> 11:11.000
AB 1507 prohibits a charter school from operating outside the boundaries of the district where it is authorized

11:11.000 --> 11:17.000
and requires existing charters who wish to continue operating outside the boundaries of the authorizer's district

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
to obtain approval prior to seeking renewal from the district where the site or resource center is located.

11:23.000 --> 11:30.000
In the alternative, the charter school can submit a petition for renewal to the district where the site or resource center is located

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
and, if approved, will be treated as a continuing school despite obtaining a new authorizer.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
And we're going to go into a little more detail on that later in this presentation.

11:39.000 --> 11:47.000
There are exceptions for emergencies and charter schools operated by federally recognized California Indian tribes are exempted from the restrictions.

11:49.000 --> 12:00.000
There also is a temporary prohibition on non-classroom based charter schools that goes from January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2022.

12:00.000 --> 12:10.000
So we do have a prohibition and during that time of this two year period, we hope to have some conversations about non-classroom based schools.

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
There are new teacher credentialing requirements that have changed for charter schools.

12:17.000 --> 12:27.000
Ed code 47605 allowed flexibility with non-core non-college preparatory teachers, but under AB 1505 that flexibility has been eliminated.

12:27.000 --> 12:39.000
The provisions apply beginning July 1, 2020. However, teachers employed in a charter school in the 2019-20 school year have until July 1, 2025 to obtain certification for their position.

12:44.000 --> 12:49.000
And as I said earlier, we are tracking the implementation of 1505.

12:50.000 --> 13:10.000
And now we are going to bring up Cindy Kazanis from AMARD who will talk a little about some of those performance categories that we're going to get into in terms of renewals and also talk a little bit about the process that AMARD used to come up with those renewal categories.

13:10.000 --> 13:20.000
Good morning, Cindy Kazanis, Director of the Analysis, Measurement and Accountability Reporting Division.

13:20.000 --> 13:30.000
And as Stephanie mentioned, we have been supporting the charter schools division to implement this very large bill over the last year and a half.

13:30.000 --> 13:39.000
I would say this is really the first step for looking at charter schools renewal, the criteria for establishing the performance categories.

13:41.000 --> 13:49.000
So one thing that the law specifies is that there is a separate track for our dashboard alternative school status.

13:49.000 --> 14:16.000
And building on our discussion yesterday and that great presentation from Dr. Luis de Velasco and others, I think it's really nice and it was a compliment to really the boards setting up the dashboard alternative school status program and really the robustness of that program that this piece of legislation actually recognizes that there needs to be a separate renewal process because these schools, as I described yesterday, for some of the programs that we're going to be working on, we're going to need to have a separate renewal process.

14:19.000 --> 14:28.000
So really our most vulnerable students and they have different populations that we're looking at than our traditional schools.

14:28.000 --> 14:42.000
And so this law specifically sets aside a different renewal process that really takes off the top all dashboard alternative school status schools.

14:43.000 --> 15:00.000
So specifically under education code section 47607C7, it outlines this process and indicates that charter school authorizers shall consider the following performance on state and local indicators in the California school dashboard.

15:01.000 --> 15:17.000
Additionally, charter school authorizers must meet with the charter school during the first year of the charter school's term to mutually agree upon and are discussed rather alternative metrics to be considered and shall notify the charter of those alternative metrics to be used within 30 days of the meeting.

15:17.000 --> 15:25.000
So again, this is a very specified process for those schools that are considered alternative schools under the DAS program.

15:26.000 --> 15:36.000
The remainder of the schools are going to be are looking are looked at through the three performance categories that are also established in 47607.

15:37.000 --> 15:45.000
47607 talks about performance levels and the words high performing, low performing, middle performing.

15:45.000 --> 15:55.000
We're actually sort of a work of art as we talk to those that negotiated this law on both sides of the issue.

15:56.000 --> 16:04.000
You know, we word smith this multiple occasions and in doing so, we're constantly checking in with stakeholders for feedback.

16:04.000 --> 16:09.000
And so this process really began in earnest at the beginning of the year.

16:09.000 --> 16:17.000
And that's because we had to, of course, look at the dashboard and the dashboard didn't come out until December of 2019.

16:17.000 --> 16:32.000
So in January of 2020, Jenny Singh and her staff really spent quite a bit of time trying to look at the law, interpret the law, reinterpret the law, check for understanding with those that helped write it.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
And what you see before you today is really the fruits of that effort.

16:35.000 --> 16:40.000
So high performing establishes or rather provides presumptive renewal.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
If the charter school meets, they establish renewal criteria.

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
So that's the code section is mentioned there.

16:48.000 --> 16:55.000
Low performing has exact opposite presumptive non renewal if the charter school meets the non renewal criteria.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
And then there's the second review, the second look.

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
And that's the verified data piece that we're going to take up in item 14.

17:01.000 --> 17:06.000
And then finally, middle performing and these schools are evaluated using additional data.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Again, the verified data piece.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
We did publicly post the data file.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
There was a January, July 1st deadline to post that data file.

17:16.000 --> 17:33.000
Ahead of that, we conducted a technical assistance webinar and ahead of the technical assistance webinar, we met with not only the the charter school organizations, but also had good conversations with Los Angeles Unified School District.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
You said, you know, we're going to need some extra support on how to talk about this.

17:37.000 --> 17:43.000
And so one of the flyers that I wanted to show you this briefly, it's in the item was directly as a result of that conversation.

17:43.000 --> 17:54.000
So, again, trying to provide technical assistance on how to implement this law or how to understand the data files, because, well, you know, the law may not be clear.

17:54.000 --> 18:04.000
We need to make something that's tangible to actually have our l.a.'s and our professors implement.

18:04.000 --> 18:18.000
So there are additional criteria per Education Code Section 47607E that specifies a chartering authorizer may deny renewal of DAS charter schools and non-DAS charter schools in any of the three performance categories.

18:18.000 --> 18:31.000
If the following occur, there's a finding that the school is unlikely to successfully implement the program due to substantial financial or governance factors, or the charter school is not serving all of pupils who wish to attend.

18:34.000 --> 18:55.000
So just a couple of terminology pieces so that you understand where this list developed from Education Code Section again 47607C3 specifies looking at English language arts, literacy, mathematics results, the college career indicator and the English under progress indicator.

18:55.000 --> 19:09.000
The other terminology that we needed to also define and check for understanding was around the performance of charter schools under student groups that they had to be compared with the statewide average on the four state academic indicators that I just mentioned on the prior slide.

19:09.000 --> 19:23.000
So our interpretation of that, and again, we did definitely check for understanding with all of the larger stakeholders, was using the status as we do on the dashboard as being the statewide average for academic indicators.

19:23.000 --> 19:31.000
And the reasons you can see below, we use status because the term average refers to a number and status is much more precise than a color.

19:31.000 --> 19:40.000
And of course, we use this on the dashboard and the field is very familiar with the word status and of course change, which is not being discussed here.

19:40.000 --> 19:52.000
So a school can be placed again, these are non DAS schools and placed into the high, middle or low performance categories based on two different methodologies.

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
And again, this is really well articulated in that flyer that I just showed you.

19:57.000 --> 20:07.000
First is criterion one. So based on all the colors received for all the state indicators in the dashboard and for that we're looking at only school wide data.

20:07.000 --> 20:18.000
Criterion tool is looking at the status for all academic indicators with 30 or more students and the school wide and student group data is considered when we use criterion two.

20:18.000 --> 20:30.000
So we created a flow chart to help describe this. This has gone through a couple iterations as well, so I'm hoping this is useful to the board and to the public.

20:30.000 --> 20:38.000
Of course, the red box at the top says non DAS charter schools because again, DAS charter schools do not use this renewal process.

20:38.000 --> 20:44.000
So we're looking at traditional charter schools. The first thing we do is we look at the colors of all the state indicators.

20:44.000 --> 20:51.000
We see if anybody gets that high or that low performance piece. So actually, let me take that back.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
We look to see whether or not they have all blues and greens or all reds and oranges.

20:56.000 --> 21:08.000
So for the far left box, you see if they achieved all blues and greens on the dashboard for those four indicators, they would have a high performing presumptive renewal.

21:08.000 --> 21:16.000
If they had all reds and oranges, presumptive non renewal and a possible renewal using the verified data piece.

21:17.000 --> 21:25.000
Finally, if you have a combination of blue, green, yellow, orange and red, all of our colors on the dashboard, you move to step two.

21:28.000 --> 21:35.000
So step two starts with schools that did not meet the first criteria. So we're looking at dashboard status.

21:35.000 --> 21:44.000
We move from the colors to the status and the criterion two now puts those labels on high, low or middle performing.

21:44.000 --> 21:56.000
So starting again on the left hand side, school and majority of student groups who scored higher than the statewide average for distance from standard for English language arts on the CASP,

21:56.000 --> 22:07.000
distance from standard for mathematics on the CASP, percent prepared for the college career indicator and percent improved in language acquisition under the English learner progress indicator.

22:07.000 --> 22:12.000
Those schools would be determined to be high performing and they'd have the presumptive renewal.

22:14.000 --> 22:23.000
Reversely, if we look at again, school and majority of student groups who scored lower than the statewide average for all of those above.

22:23.000 --> 22:33.000
So again, distance from standard for English language arts, distance from standards for mathematics, percent prepared on the college career indicator and percent improved in the language acquisition.

22:33.000 --> 22:40.000
There's a presumptive non renewal and they're considered low performing and we move into that verified data piece.

22:40.000 --> 22:45.000
Majority that you will see in the next couple of slides actually fall into the middle performing.

22:45.000 --> 22:50.000
They do not meet the criterion.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
And they're also going to be using the verified data piece.

22:54.000 --> 23:00.000
So let me show you the results based on all schools who are eligible.

23:00.000 --> 23:05.000
I have a couple of things to note.

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
First, the end size for this is twelve hundred charter schools.

23:09.000 --> 23:15.000
We wanted to look at charter schools that have been open for two years because we need to, of course, have a color on the dashboard.

23:15.000 --> 23:19.000
And then none of the other criteria that's under education code.

23:19.000 --> 23:26.000
I'm sorry I did not cite the code, but they cannot be on the differentiated assistance list.

23:26.000 --> 23:40.000
So because charter schools are treated as local educational, educational agencies under our state system of support, they cannot be also receiving support under our differentiated assistance piece.

23:40.000 --> 23:47.000
So none of these high performing schools fell on that list for the nineteen twenty school year.

23:47.000 --> 23:53.000
Based on the twenty nineteen dashboard, so it gets a little confusing.

23:53.000 --> 24:07.000
So the interesting thing about the results is that on that criterion one for school only, there were no schools out of the twelve hundred that had all reds and all oranges.

24:07.000 --> 24:12.000
There were twenty seven high performing schools who received all blues and all greens.

24:12.000 --> 24:19.000
So that's the presumptive renewal for those twenty seven schools.

24:19.000 --> 24:28.000
We move on to criterion two and again looking at school wide based on status and looking at student group results as well.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
And again, I forgot to mention these are broken out by school type.

24:32.000 --> 24:37.000
So we have elementary, middle, high, K-12, and then we do the totals.

24:37.000 --> 24:47.000
So for criterion two, you see that seventy two schools fall into this category and on the high side you have one hundred and seventy eight.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
And this last slide brings all that data together.

24:50.000 --> 24:59.000
So the seventy two low performing, I wanted to note that of those nine are currently up for renewal this year.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
I don't have those same figures for the middle track.

25:02.000 --> 25:10.000
But again, the high track bringing those two data points together, you have roughly 18 percent who fall into that category.

25:18.000 --> 25:24.000
And with that, I don't know if we're pausing for questions or we're not pausing for questions.

25:24.000 --> 25:31.000
OK, I will turn it over to my next colleague.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
Thank you, Cindy. Good morning, board members.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
I am Carrie Lopes and I'm representing the charter schools division today.

25:38.000 --> 25:43.000
Next slides will address questions surrounding the appeals to be heard by the State Board of Education,

25:43.000 --> 25:54.000
including the standard of review, the process and the consideration of information in order for the state board to make a determination.

25:54.000 --> 26:04.000
These questions include what appeals will be heard by the state board and how does the standard and process differ in some cases for establishment and renewal appeals?

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
What information will be considered in the review of the appeal?

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
What are the timelines for the appeal process?

26:11.000 --> 26:20.000
What schools are included in the board's charter portfolio and what seven counties have jurisdiction over a single school district for the board's reference?

26:20.000 --> 26:26.000
For reference, I do want to let you know that in attachments two and three in the item,

26:26.000 --> 26:40.000
it does list the charter schools that are authorized by the state board along with the seven counties that have jurisdiction over a single school district.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
So reviewing appeal review standards.

26:43.000 --> 26:49.000
In the past, the state board has heard appeals for establishments, renewals and revocations of charter schools.

26:49.000 --> 26:56.000
Within the context of AB 1505, the state board will still continue to consider the same types of appeals.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
However, the standard of review will be different.

26:59.000 --> 27:04.000
This slide shows the type of appeal and the standard of review that will be applied.

27:04.000 --> 27:18.000
The first two boxes show that new and renewal petitions denied by a single district county and renewal petitions for state board authorized schools denied at the local level will be considered under a de novo review.

27:18.000 --> 27:28.000
However, in the third box, new and renewal petitions denied by a district and county board will no longer be reviewed based on a de novo review.

27:28.000 --> 27:38.000
As state board members recall, past petitions, regardless of the denied entity, were appealed and considered by the state board under what we call the de novo review.

27:38.000 --> 27:45.000
The new standard of review for this type of appeal will now be determined based on abuse of discretion.

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
Petitioners still have the option to appeal a revocation to the state board.

27:50.000 --> 27:59.000
This type of appeal will be considered by reviewing substantial evidence and making a determination on whether to uphold the revocation or reverse the decision.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
So let's talk a little bit about the standard of review.

28:07.000 --> 28:22.000
In the past, the state board's review standard was generally under the de novo review, meaning that the state board made an independent determination regarding the petition and independently considered all of the issues previously considered by the district and the county.

28:23.000 --> 28:37.000
Remember that the state board will still consider appeals under this standard of review if the petition is denied by a single district county or the school is currently authorized by the state board and is denied at the local level during renewal.

28:37.000 --> 28:49.000
During the appeal process, the state board will consider all required elements such as the petition, the budget, any relevant academic data or prior history and all local findings.

28:49.000 --> 29:00.000
The role of the ACCS commissioners will be to review the item, the CDE analysis and recommendation, and make a recommendation to the state board to either approve or deny the petition.

29:00.000 --> 29:12.000
The role of the state board will be to independently consider all of the issues previously considered by the district and county and make a determination to either approve or deny the petition.

29:12.000 --> 29:18.000
This process would be similar to your most recent experience at the July board meeting.

29:19.000 --> 29:29.000
Abuse of discretion is a new term and a new standard of review that has been delegated solely to the state board.

29:29.000 --> 29:37.000
An abuse of discretion review changes the information that the state board will consider the role of the ACCS and the role of the state board.

29:37.000 --> 29:46.000
Remember that the state board will consider appeals that fall into this standard for charter schools that are denied by the local district and county board.

29:46.000 --> 29:55.000
The ACCS will review the item and the CDE recommendation and will recommend to the state board to either hear or summarily deny the appeal.

29:55.000 --> 30:00.000
Additionally, the ACCS has the option to make a no recommendation.

30:00.000 --> 30:09.000
During the appeal process, the state board will review the documentary record and decide whether there was an abuse of discretion by the school district and or county board of education.

30:09.000 --> 30:14.000
The state board has the option to reverse a local decision.

30:14.000 --> 30:31.000
Additionally, keep in mind that with this change in reviewing appeals, the state board could potentially hear an appeal under a de novo review and an appeal under an abuse of discretion review at the same board meeting.

30:31.000 --> 30:42.000
So we've had an opportunity to discuss changes to the appeal process, but I wanted to spend a moment talking about changes in the findings for a denial of an establishment of a school.

30:42.000 --> 30:49.000
During a review, local districts and counties will still need to make written factual findings in order to deny a petition.

30:49.000 --> 30:57.000
These generally include an unsound educational program that the petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program.

30:57.000 --> 31:09.000
The petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 required elements, or the petition does not contain the required signatures and affirmations.

31:09.000 --> 31:15.000
However, AB 1505 is add the following new to new findings for consideration.

31:15.000 --> 31:23.000
The first one being the school is demonstrably unlikely to serve the interest of the entire community in which the school proposes to locate.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
That's the first new finding.

31:25.000 --> 31:32.000
The second is the school district is not positioned to absorb the fiscal impact of the charter school.

31:32.000 --> 31:45.000
Also, keep in mind that these two findings may be applied to an existing charter school that is requesting a material revision in order to either expand operations or by adding sites or grade levels.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
Let's take a closer look at these two findings.

31:53.000 --> 32:02.000
Community impact makes a determination that the school is demonstrably unlikely to serve the interest of the entire community in which the school proposes to locate.

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
When making this finding, the following may be considered.

32:06.000 --> 32:22.000
The fiscal impact of the proposed school, the extent to which the proposed school would substantially undermine existing services, academic offerings or programmatic offerings, whether the school duplicates a program currently offered by the school district.

32:22.000 --> 32:30.000
Fiscal impact makes a determination that the school district is not positioned to absorb the fiscal impact of the charter school.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
A school district satisfy satisfies this criteria.

32:34.000 --> 32:41.000
If the following is met, the district is under the authority of a state trustee or administrator.

32:41.000 --> 32:46.000
The district is a negative certification or the district is in qualified certification.

32:46.000 --> 32:58.000
And the county superintendent and fiscal crisis and management assistance team or FICMAT certify that the approval of the charter school would result in the district having a negative certification.

33:03.000 --> 33:15.000
So next, I'd like to turn it over to Stephanie Farland, who's going to be explaining more in detail the role of the California Department of Education, the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools and the State Board.

33:17.000 --> 33:23.000
Thanks, Carrie.

33:23.000 --> 33:30.000
So Carrie has gone over a lot of the detail about the new types of appeals.

33:30.000 --> 33:38.000
Some of the slides that you're going to see coming up go over that again, but we just felt like this is a really new process for you all.

33:38.000 --> 33:43.000
And saying it a couple of times might might be a good thing.

33:43.000 --> 33:53.000
So the role of the Department of Ed, the CDE will continue to review petitions on appeal and make recommendations to the State Board of Ed.

33:53.000 --> 33:59.000
However, the recommendations will differ depending on the type of appeal being reviewed.

33:59.000 --> 34:10.000
So we will continue to review and provide a recommendation to grant or deny an appeal from a district decision where the county has jurisdiction over a single school district and SB authorized charter schools.

34:10.000 --> 34:16.000
And as Carrie mentioned just a moment ago, those follow the same de novo review process that you're used to.

34:16.000 --> 34:25.000
Then we will review and provide a recommendation on whether a district or county abused its discretion after denial by the district and county.

34:25.000 --> 34:29.000
And so those will look a little different because the information we're looking at is a little different.

34:29.000 --> 34:39.000
Those are not a de novo review, as Carrie mentioned, and we will be looking at the documentary record at the local level to make that determination and provide a recommendation.

34:39.000 --> 34:44.000
The role of the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
So it does change a little bit.

34:46.000 --> 34:52.000
Prior to AB 1505, the role of the ACCS was not required by statute.

34:52.000 --> 35:06.000
The historical role has been to serve as an advisory body that holds public meetings to make recommendations to the SBE on non-classroom based funding determination requests and whether it should a recommendation on whether it should approve or deny a charter on appeal.

35:07.000 --> 35:15.000
AB 1505 contemplates a statutory role for the ACCS, so it is in statute now.

35:15.000 --> 35:23.000
And I'll take a moment just to say that your attachment one is probably a little different than you're normally used to seeing in attachments.

35:23.000 --> 35:39.000
But we thought it was important to give the board the most current Ed Code sections for AB, for Ed Code 47605 and 47607, which deals with the establishment and renewal of appeals.

35:39.000 --> 35:43.000
There's been obviously a lot of change with 1505.

35:43.000 --> 35:49.000
There's been some changes in recent trailer bill, trailer bills that were signed.

35:49.000 --> 36:04.000
And so what you have there is the most recent Ed Code language for these sections that we're talking about today.

36:04.000 --> 36:11.000
So we decided to sort of put into graph form, chart form, what you're used to seeing.

36:11.000 --> 36:21.000
And so this is another way of viewing what Carrie had just gone over in terms of what the ACCS process has been with de novo reviews.

36:21.000 --> 36:29.000
As we said, new and renewing petitions that were denied by a county board that has jurisdiction over a single school district.

36:29.000 --> 36:36.000
And there are seven of them in your attachment to and renewing petitions for SB authorized charter schools.

36:36.000 --> 36:42.000
We've laid it out and this will look familiar to you because this is what you have been doing for all appeals.

36:42.000 --> 36:51.000
And so that process won't change for those two types of appeals that I just mentioned.

36:51.000 --> 36:57.000
And as an aside, we have been hearing conversations from the local level.

36:57.000 --> 37:01.000
These renewals for this year are already going through the process.

37:01.000 --> 37:11.000
And so it's good to see that there are authorizers at the local level who are really contemplating how they look at these petitions on renewal,

37:11.000 --> 37:24.000
thinking about the new AB 1505 requirements and being thoughtful about how whether they renew or deny these charter appeals.

37:24.000 --> 37:30.000
So it's definitely having an impact on the local level again in graph form.

37:30.000 --> 37:35.000
Here is the process for abuse of discretion review.

37:35.000 --> 37:40.000
Here you see a flow chart for the types of appeals that were instituted under 1505.

37:40.000 --> 37:45.000
These are appeals of new and renewing petitions for charter schools denied by a district and county board.

37:45.000 --> 37:51.000
These are the appeals which we will be reviewing whether there was an abuse of discretion at the local level.

37:51.000 --> 37:58.000
And again, or actually I don't know if this was mentioned or not, but any appeals that the SBE decides there was an abuse of discretion,

37:58.000 --> 38:08.000
those charters will not be SBE authorized as AB 1505 got rid of that part of SBE authorization.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
SBE is no longer an authorizer.

38:10.000 --> 38:15.000
So in consultation with the charter, the SBE will be designating a charter authority,

38:15.000 --> 38:24.000
either the district or the county where that charter is located.

38:24.000 --> 38:29.000
So as mentioned several times now, the role of the state board will look different under the new appeals requirements.

38:29.000 --> 38:36.000
This slide outlines the different review processes that the SBE will undertake for each of the different petitions that come in on appeal.

38:36.000 --> 38:44.000
I think the biggest change obviously will be that the SBE will now be reviewing the documentary record to determine if there is an abuse of discretion

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
in some of these renewals.

38:46.000 --> 38:53.000
Under this type of appeal, the SBE is not reviewing the petition and the finances and the governance of the charter.

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
They are looking solely at the documentary record.

38:56.000 --> 39:00.000
This is how the CDE and the ACCS will also be reviewing these appeals.

39:00.000 --> 39:05.000
So this will be a big change from the way this body is used to reviewing appeals.

39:05.000 --> 39:11.000
And as Kerry mentioned, we can also expect that we will have a combination of different types of appeals at one meeting.

39:11.000 --> 39:16.000
So it will be until we all are used to this process.

39:16.000 --> 39:21.000
It'll probably feel a little disjointed to have different types of appeals at one meeting.

39:21.000 --> 39:25.000
But we will we will get you through this.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
And please remember that this is all new.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
We haven't had any of these appeals yet.

39:30.000 --> 39:39.000
So we will be giving you the staff at CDE will be giving you updated overviews as we move closer to hearing an abuse of discretion appeal.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
I'm not sure when those will come in.

39:42.000 --> 39:52.000
But if I had to gather a guess, I'd probably say the earliest we'd see an abuse of discretion appeal would probably be at the March March meeting.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
And why is that? Well, here's the new timelines for the appeal process.

39:55.000 --> 40:05.000
And under the new timelines, extend the review periods under 1505, extend the review periods at the local level from 60 days to 90 days.

40:05.000 --> 40:14.000
So when you think about a charter petition that is being renewed or established at the local level, the local district has 90 days for to make their decision.

40:14.000 --> 40:21.000
And then it goes up to appeal if it's denied to the county mask is going crazy here.

40:21.000 --> 40:26.000
It goes up to the county and then the county has 90 days to make their decision.

40:26.000 --> 40:34.000
So in total, that's almost six months or about six months of time before they actually can submit their appeal to the state board of ed.

40:34.000 --> 40:39.000
So what we're seeing this year is obviously the appeal process or the appeal.

40:39.000 --> 40:46.000
The review process at the local level has started much earlier than it normally would in the school year.

40:46.000 --> 40:52.000
So we have lots of renewals and establishments going through the process right now.

40:52.000 --> 41:03.000
But as it takes 90 days to get really 180 days to get through both levels at the local level, it will take some time to get up to us here at the state.

41:03.000 --> 41:09.000
So we won't expect to see any until probably, like I said, the March March agenda.

41:09.000 --> 41:20.000
And I expect that May and July will will have our hands full.

41:20.000 --> 41:26.000
So as Kerry mentioned before, there are 36 charters under the S.B.E.'s authorization.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
Six of those are up for renewal this year.

41:29.000 --> 41:37.000
And so we can expect as they go through renewal, I think we've seen two so far at the local level, one that was approved.

41:37.000 --> 41:41.000
So we no longer have that charter and one I believe that was denied.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
So that one probably will come up on appeal.

41:44.000 --> 41:49.000
And so, as we said before, those that come up on appeal will be a de novo de novo review.

41:49.000 --> 41:55.000
That'll be what you're used to what you're used to seeing.

41:55.000 --> 42:00.000
We also have a statewide benefit charter, and that is a high tech high.

42:00.000 --> 42:08.000
And they are in the process of contemplating how they want to move forward as they are no longer allowed to be under state board authorization.

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
And as soon as we have any information on that, we will share it with you.

42:11.000 --> 42:16.000
And then we have the seven district wide charters that will remain as they are.

42:17.000 --> 42:29.000
And we the S.B.E. delegates oversight duties of the remaining charter schools to the Department of Ed, with the exception of one at the current moment, which was time community school, which was approved at the July board meeting.

42:29.000 --> 42:35.000
And if you remember, L.A. County has volunteered to take oversight of that school.

42:35.000 --> 42:53.000
So. That's kind of where we are in terms of appeals, the types of appeals that come to the state board, the timelines and the role that the department ACCS and state board will be establishing under this new fifteen oh five appeal process.

42:54.000 --> 43:05.000
So now we are going to talk a little bit about the new the new non classroom based charter school requirements that have come about under fifteen oh five and fifteen oh seven.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
And for that, I'm going to bring up McKenna Huey.

43:13.000 --> 43:21.000
Good morning, state board members. My name is McKenna Huey, representing the charter schools division, and I will talk to you today about non classroom based charter schools.

43:21.000 --> 43:34.000
So E.B. fifteen oh five added Education Code section four seven six one two point seven, which prohibits the approval of a petition for the establishment of a new charter school that offers non classroom based instruction.

43:34.000 --> 43:40.000
This includes virtual schools and also charter schools that are funded as non classroom based charters.

43:40.000 --> 43:47.000
So this provision is from January one twenty twenty to January one twenty twenty two.

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
And there are a couple of exceptions to this provision.

43:50.000 --> 44:01.000
It does not apply to non classroom based charter schools that were granted approval and started serving people's prior to October one twenty nineteen under either of the following two circumstances.

44:01.000 --> 44:14.000
So either a charter school was required to submit a petition to the governing board of a school district or county board of education in an adjacent county in which its existing resource centers located in order to comply with education.

44:15.000 --> 44:21.000
Good section four seven six oh five point one or to retain current program offerings or enrollment.

44:21.000 --> 44:36.000
This also does not apply to charter schools that were required to submit a petition to a school district or county board of education in which a resource center is located in order to comply with the Anderson versus Shasta court decision or other relevant court ruling.

44:36.000 --> 44:42.000
And if the petition is necessary to retain current program offerings or enrollment.

44:42.000 --> 44:55.000
So this section of education code that eighty fifteen oh five added cannot be waived by the state board and it shall remain in effect until January one twenty twenty three and is repealed as of that date.

44:55.000 --> 45:21.000
So a charter school authorized by a different chartering authority in order to come into compliance with the geographic requirements put forth in education code section four seven six one two point seven shall be regarded by the department as a continuing charter school for all purposes to the extent that it does not conflict with federal law.

45:21.000 --> 45:43.000
And so the CDE refers to charter schools coming into compliance with this section as a restructured charter school and a charter school is considered restructured if it either wholly changes its authorizer or if it divided into multiple charter schools by having its sites approved by different chartering authority in order to comply with the geographic requirements.

45:43.000 --> 45:55.000
So in most cases and pursuant to statute restructured charter schools are required to be treated as continuing by the CDE for all purposes, including accountability and funding.

45:55.000 --> 46:14.000
To date, there is one known instance of a restructured charter school in fiscal year twenty twenty to twenty one and the CDE is prepared to treat this charter school as continuing and has been in communication with the school regarding the implications of this.

46:14.000 --> 46:29.000
So to implement the treat as continuing the requirement cleanup language was introduced in Senate bills ninety eight and eight twenty specifically these bills added new sections of education code as well as amended previous sections of education code to align with this new requirement.

46:29.000 --> 46:40.000
And you can see exactly which sections were added or amended on this slide.

46:40.000 --> 47:03.000
So as I touched upon in yesterday's funding determination items, the CDE anticipates that the state board will hear fewer funding determination requests as section seventy five of Senate bill eight twenty significantly impacts the funding determination request process for renewing non classroom based charter schools for fiscal year twenty twenty to twenty one and twenty twenty one to twenty two.

47:03.000 --> 47:26.000
So specifically this section extends the deadline for non classroom based charter schools to submit a funding determination renewal request from the date of February first to instead June thirtieth twenty twenty one and June thirtieth twenty twenty two depending on when a charter school's current funding determination period expires.

47:27.000 --> 47:38.000
So pursuant to this bill, non classroom based charter schools that submit a complete funding determination request by the June thirtieth deadline will receive their current level of funding for two years.

47:38.000 --> 47:44.000
Charter schools that submit a request after the deadline will receive eighty five percent for two years.

47:44.000 --> 48:01.000
However, as currently permitted under regulations, both the charter school and the CDE may request that a school's funding level be reconsidered by the ACCS or the state board.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
Thank you, McKenna.

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
So that was a lot of information.

48:05.000 --> 48:14.000
Everyone that spoke today and also members of our school fiscal services division are here to answer questions.

48:14.000 --> 48:18.000
And before we I hand it back off to you, President Darlingham.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
And I just want to say a quick thank you.

48:20.000 --> 48:26.000
Today will be the last day in our charter schools division that we have Carrie Lopes with us.

48:26.000 --> 48:35.000
She has provided a lot of support to the ACCS and to the board on charter school issues for the last few years.

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
And we just want to say thank you to her.

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
Thank you.

48:41.000 --> 48:50.000
Thank you to her and thank you to you for this very complex item and the very good explanation of it.

48:50.000 --> 48:53.000
We are going to go to public comment next.

48:53.000 --> 49:05.000
While people are queuing up for public comment, we'll take a five minute break and then come back and take public comment after which we'll hear from our board liaisons and enter into discussion.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
So it is now nine fifty five.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
You may take five minutes.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
We'll see you back at ten o'clock.

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
Get your coffee and we'll see you shortly.

49:14.000 --> 49:28.000
And those who are interested in calling in for public comment on the slide, you'll see the number and the access code to call into and we'll take those comments as soon as we return.

49:28.000 --> 49:33.000
Turn off your video and your and mute your computer.

49:33.000 --> 49:38.000
Do not leave the meeting board members.

49:38.000 --> 49:43.000
So we are now ready for public comment.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
Are there any public comments?

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Do you want to reestablish the quorum?

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Oh, yeah, let's reestablish the quorum.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
Please do.

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
OK.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Member Sun.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
Here.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Vice President Strauss.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
Here.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
Member Rucker.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
Here.

49:59.000 --> 50:03.000
Member Rodriguez.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
Here.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
Member Patil Brownson.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
Here.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
Member Navo.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
Here.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
Member McQuillan.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
Here.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Member Glover Woods.

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
Here.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Member Patil.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
Here.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
President Darlene Hammond.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
Here.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
Member Burr.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
Here.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
Everyone's present.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
All right.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
And we will now open up the line for public comment.

50:30.000 --> 50:33.000
Are there any public commenters?

50:33.000 --> 50:37.000
Currently, we have 12 people in the queue.

50:37.000 --> 50:43.000
And callers, a quick reminder, this is for item 13 only.

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
If you would like to speak for another item, please hang up

50:46.000 --> 50:50.000
and call back at the appropriate time.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Thank you for joining us.

50:52.000 --> 50:56.000
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
First caller, your time starts now.

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
Good morning, honorable board members and Superintendent Thurmond.

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
My name is Helen Lopez, and I am the Manager of Data and Analytics

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
for Green Dot Public Schools.

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
I am calling today to urge you to include CAS data

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
and core student growth percentiles on the verified data list.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
I spent hours pouring over data with our principals

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
to support them in their efforts to accelerate...

51:22.000 --> 51:25.000
Caller, please excuse me.

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
You are speaking to the wrong item.

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
Can I ask you to call back at the appropriate time?

51:31.000 --> 51:36.000
Thank you.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Next caller, you are now unmuted.

51:38.000 --> 51:45.000
Please speak your name and affiliation for the record.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
and members of the board.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
I'm Ruth Dutton with Clovis Global Academy.

51:51.000 --> 51:54.000
I urge the board to direct the CDE to stop using the terms

51:54.000 --> 51:58.000
low, mid, and high performing in the track sorting renewal guidance.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
The track sorting criteria already penalizes schools

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
serving vulnerable populations and privileges schools

52:03.000 --> 52:06.000
serving students entering with higher academic baselines.

52:06.000 --> 52:09.000
Calling these tracks high, mid, and low means that the CDE

52:09.000 --> 52:12.000
is drawing conclusions from the data for authorizers,

52:12.000 --> 52:15.000
framing the data, and biasing data interpretation

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
before the authorizer even has the chance to view the numbers

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
to interpret what the data says about a school's quality.

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
I urge the board to insist tracks be identified

52:24.000 --> 52:28.000
with neutral terminology such as track one, two, and three

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
to avoid further biasing a renewal process

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
that is already being made unnecessarily arduous and complex

52:34.000 --> 52:38.000
by the department's overreach pertaining to item 14 on today's agenda.

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
Further, the burden of proof should be on the CDE

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
to explain why it must use high, mid, low names on these tracks

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
instead of neutral numbering.

52:46.000 --> 52:50.000
The CDE should explain why determining authorizers' conclusions

52:50.000 --> 52:54.000
is going to be best for kids in our state.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
Thank you, caller.

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
Your time starts now.

53:08.000 --> 53:11.000
Caller, are you on the line?

53:12.000 --> 53:16.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
Your time starts now.

53:20.000 --> 53:23.000
Hi, board members. My name is Angela DeRamos.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
I'm a classroom teacher representing

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
California Teachers Association.

53:27.000 --> 53:33.000
CTA appreciates CDE's work on AB 1505 and 1507 implementation.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
In our letter in item 13,

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
CTA has pointed out some clarifications regarding this item.

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
Finding for denials for the establishment of charter school

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
should be clarified to ensure that sound educational practice

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
and the interests of the community are essential

53:48.000 --> 53:51.000
and that no matter the track of the charter school,

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
substantial fiscal, substantial governance,

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
or creaming and cropping of students are all factors

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
that could lead to the denial of an existing charter school.

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
And that even though SB 820 discusses funding requests

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
for non-classroom-based charters,

54:04.000 --> 54:09.000
the SBE and CDE still have the authority to require updated information

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
from a non-classroom-based charter

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
and that the SBE can still terminate a non-classroom-based charter.

54:14.000 --> 54:18.000
Lastly, CTA is prepared to support the SBE and CDE

54:18.000 --> 54:21.000
to ensure that the legislation intent is heeded.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
Thank you so much.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Thank you, caller.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Your time starts now.

54:32.000 --> 54:35.000
Good morning, honorable board members and Superintendent Thurmond.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
My name is Julia Holland,

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
and I'm the Public Programs Manager for Green Dot Public School.

54:40.000 --> 54:43.000
In my role, I lead Green Dot compliance efforts

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
with our authorizers and state agencies.

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
I'm calling today to urge you to include CAHPS data

54:48.000 --> 54:52.000
and core student growth percentiles on the state's verified data list.

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
Seven of Greenup schools are currently going through a hike.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Caller, I am so sorry.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
You are speaking to the wrong item.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
We'll need you to call back at the appropriate time.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
Which item?

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
This is item number 13.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
And which one should I call back for?

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
14, which will be the next item.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Okay, thank you.

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
Thank you.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Callers in the queue, just a quick reminder.

55:14.000 --> 55:18.000
We are only taking calls for item number 13.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
If you would like to speak to item 14,

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
we need you to hang up at this time and call back.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Thank you.

55:25.000 --> 55:29.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Your time starts now.

55:34.000 --> 55:37.000
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond and board members.

55:37.000 --> 55:42.000
This is Liz Guillen with Public Advocates and today also for the ACLU.

55:42.000 --> 55:46.000
The charter school reforms that were just presented incorporate existing

55:46.000 --> 55:50.000
law that we advance to clarify that charter schools are accessible for all

55:50.000 --> 55:54.000
students, that there not be enrollment policies or practices that limit

55:54.000 --> 55:58.000
enrollment for English learners, low-income students,

55:58.000 --> 56:01.000
students experiencing homelessness with exceptional needs,

56:01.000 --> 56:04.000
neglected or delinquent students, foster youth,

56:04.000 --> 56:10.000
or on the basis of their nationality, race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation.

56:10.000 --> 56:14.000
We appreciate being included in the stakeholder outreach by the department

56:14.000 --> 56:18.000
and board staff as they prepare to make new regulations to ensure there is

56:18.000 --> 56:22.000
clear guidance on how to implement this new process.

56:22.000 --> 56:26.000
We want to make clear that charter school authorizers have to closely review

56:26.000 --> 56:31.000
admissions policies and practices during the approval and renewal processes

56:31.000 --> 56:36.000
so that enrollment is not limited for high-need student groups.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Thank you.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
Thank you.

56:39.000 --> 56:43.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

56:43.000 --> 56:50.000
Your time starts now.

56:50.000 --> 56:53.000
Caller, are you on the line?

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Hi.

56:55.000 --> 56:56.000
Can you hear me?

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
Yes, please go ahead.

56:57.000 --> 56:58.000
Oh, great.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.000
Hi.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
This is Amy Burfield.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
I'm the Executive Director of New Heights Charter School in Los Angeles.

57:02.000 --> 57:05.000
I'm calling just to share how the terms high-performing,

57:05.000 --> 57:09.000
middle-performing, and so on played out in our renewal track sorting.

57:09.000 --> 57:13.000
We're a school that serves 98% low-income students with 30% of our kids

57:13.000 --> 57:18.000
who are EL students, and although our kids perform very well on the CAS

57:18.000 --> 57:23.000
and do well on the dashboard for ELA and math, scoring actually 39 points

57:23.000 --> 57:28.000
better than the state average in EL and 52 points better than the math in EL,

57:28.000 --> 57:32.000
our LP score ended up being low on the one year of measure that you all looked

57:32.000 --> 57:36.000
at when we were up for renewal this fall, and so then we were denied being on

57:36.000 --> 57:40.000
the high track just because of the LP score, and it's ironic because we had

57:40.000 --> 57:44.000
reclassified so many kids the year before that our remaining EL group were

57:44.000 --> 57:48.000
not our kids at the lower grades who had successfully reclassified,

57:48.000 --> 57:51.000
but they were our special needs students.

57:51.000 --> 57:55.000
37% of them are duly identified as EL and special ed at our upper grades,

57:55.000 --> 57:58.000
and we just needed more time to reclassify with them.

57:58.000 --> 58:03.000
And if you looked at our data for Los Angeles, you'll see it reduces over time.

58:03.000 --> 58:06.000
So please look at this more closely. Thank you.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
Thank you.

58:07.000 --> 58:10.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

58:10.000 --> 58:13.000
Your time starts now.

58:18.000 --> 58:19.000
Caller, are you on?

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Hi, Romelia. Hi there.

58:21.000 --> 58:25.000
Romelia, it's one call on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association.

58:26.000 --> 58:30.000
First of all, we want to thank Stephanie Farland and her team at CDE and the staff

58:30.000 --> 58:34.000
also at the State Board of Education for the outreach and opportunity to weigh in

58:34.000 --> 58:38.000
on the scope and content of regulations.

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
We look forward to continuing to engage in the process.

58:41.000 --> 58:46.000
CCSA was deeply engaged with the administration in the content of AB 1505 and 1507.

58:46.000 --> 58:50.000
We believe that these goals will also provide clear and balanced reforms to the

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Charter School Act.

58:52.000 --> 58:56.000
We urge the board to take a cautious approach to regulating these laws,

58:56.000 --> 59:00.000
and we generally support an approach to the State Board of Education regulation

59:00.000 --> 59:03.000
that will provide clarity on the processes as needed.

59:03.000 --> 59:07.000
The regulation process should not be used to interpret or reinterpret or reopen

59:07.000 --> 59:12.000
issues that were already delicately debated or resolved in the legislative process.

59:12.000 --> 59:16.000
We look forward to actively participating as the process continues,

59:16.000 --> 59:19.000
and thank you for your engagement on this important issue. Thank you.

59:19.000 --> 59:20.000
Thank you.

59:20.000 --> 59:24.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Your time starts now.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Caller, you're live.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Okay, that person hung up.

59:37.000 --> 59:41.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Your time starts now.

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond and members of the board.

59:48.000 --> 59:51.000
I'm Suzanne Cuy of the Charter School Development Center.

59:51.000 --> 59:55.000
Regarding the terms low performing, middle performing, and high performing

59:55.000 --> 59:58.000
to describe schools on the three renewal tracks,

59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000
track sorting uses blunt tools.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Analysis of state data shows the track placement correlates highly with income,

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000
but in many cases does not reflect student progress.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Some schools on the low track are the highest performing schools that their students

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000
have access to whose resident schools score lower and would also be on the same

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000
track if non-charters were held accountable.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:29.000
We want to keep stronger schools open to students even if they are charters.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Some surprising data issues arise because track sorting compares to state K-12

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:39.000
averages for all schools without adjusting for grade level and so on.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000
We suggest using accurate language and referring to schools by track to prevent

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
bias prior to deeper looks at data.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Thank you.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Thank you, caller.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Your time starts now.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Caller, are you on the line?

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Okay, thank you.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
This concludes public comment.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Thank you very much.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
The conference has been locked.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Maybe we can take down the public comment slide now.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:26.000
And I'd like to turn to our liaisons to give us some framing.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000
That would be Subra and Ting Sun.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000
And then we'll go into our board discussion.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Thank you, Linda.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Thank you, Linda.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000
First I'll just say I have a bunch of construction going on outside my window.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
So if you hear a lot of noise, I apologize.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Let me know and I'll try to do whatever I can about that.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:57.000
First I just want to say express my appreciation to the department and the board staff.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:04.000
As you can tell, this has been not only an exhaustive process but an exhausting process.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.000
I think to everybody who's been involved in trying to sort this through,

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:14.000
there are a lot of conflicting or sort of things that are open to interpretation.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:20.000
I think in the legislation, some of it has been clarified in the trailer bills.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Nevertheless, there will be a lot for the board to kind of wade through over the next couple of years, I think, relative to charters.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:35.000
I have several questions about the presentation, I think, for clarification,

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:41.000
but I will stop if it's okay with you, Linda, and let Ting say any opening comments that she might have

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000
and then just ask if you could come back to me for questions.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Absolutely.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Ting.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Yes, thank you.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:57.000
I want to echo Member Burr's comments as well and appreciation for the CDE staff working across divisions, departments.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:03.000
It is taking a team effort to implement this law, which is very complex,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:10.000
and I also appreciate the breakdown in the presentation to make the information digestible.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:21.000
AB 1505 makes dramatic changes to the charter law, impacting over 1,300 charter schools and 640,000 public school students in California.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:29.000
So as we go through and as Member Burr said, there's going to be a lot more to work through through the regulations

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:37.000
and through how that new review process, renewal process is going to look like for us.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:43.000
So I just want to encourage us all to keep students in mind.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:52.000
And as we are looking at information and data, even as the public comments have you heard,

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:58.000
there is more to some of that data that as we're looking at,

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000
there is a little bit deeper than what seems to be the service numbers.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
So that's really all.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:10.000
And I also will have a couple of questions as well, but I will save that for the questions.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.000
All right, well, we're going to go into the question part.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000
So, Sue, I'm going to come back to you for some questions.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
I'm going to open the floor to others.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000
I'll be watching for participants to raise their hand.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Thank you, Linda.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000
First is kind of a technical question and maybe for Cindy.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:37.000
She talked and it was helpful to hear the clarification about there's a separate renewal process for schools that are categorized

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000
as DOS schools or the alternative accountability schools.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:47.000
And I believe on one of her slides, she said that it sounds like a little bit of a mutually agreed to process,

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000
but she's talked about DOS schools were in the first year of their term,

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.000
coming to agreement with their authorizer about what metrics to be used.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000
We have many, many DOS schools that have been around for years.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
And I'm curious to know what about those existing schools?

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Are they somehow grandfathered in or how does that process work?

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Hi, Sue, it's Cindy.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
It's a great question.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:23.000
The law does not talk about schools that have existed for a longer period of time.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.000
So like many things in this law, there are there are pieces of it that are silent.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:35.000
So I do not have any additional information for you beyond that.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:41.000
OK, I didn't mean for that to be a stumping question.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Not at all. You started off with a good one.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:49.000
I should make you aware as well that there are several attorneys in the room and Judy,

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:55.000
especially as it looks like may be ready to be teed up if you want to direct the question to an attorney.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Well, I just think that that's kind of a big open question that probably doesn't need to be resolved.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:10.000
And maybe by accident, I brought up an example of where this law is still needs lots of clarification.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
And there'll be lots to work through.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:18.000
So the second question, and maybe this is for Carrie or it might be for Stephanie, whichever.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:23.000
I just wanted to understand for sure how fiscal impact is determined.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Because when you talked about the community impact, you mentioned fiscal impact.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:36.000
And then there was sort of the separate almost and if or and or fiscal impact that had very specific definition.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:47.000
And I I'm just trying to figure out if authorizers get two bites of the apple on fiscal impact or they explicitly have to be in those categories that were outlined on the slide.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000
So, Sue, this is Stephanie.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:07:00.000
There are two new two new references to fiscal impact in fifteen oh five.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:05.000
As you mentioned, there is a fiscal impact reference under the community impact piece.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.000
And then there's the fiscal impact criteria that stands alone.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:25.000
And the one that stands alone has very definitive criteria in terms of moving a district into, you know, from and I'm probably the not the best person to remember how this all goes.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.000
But from from positive to qualified or negative.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:34.000
So and there's a process that the county and FICMAT will use to determine that.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
And that seems to be pretty pretty cut and dry.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:44.000
The fiscal impact under the community impact piece is something that we are working through right now.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:55.000
When we had our stakeholder meetings last week with authorizer groups, union groups and charter school operators and charter school advocacy groups, we discussed that at length.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:00.000
And so we got a lot of feedback from those folks.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:11.000
And so we're we're still sort of working towards how how an authorizer might determine fiscal impact in the community piece.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:22.000
You know, I know that we're careful, as one of the caller stated earlier, you know, not to interpret or add more into regulations than the law intended.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:34.000
So we are sort of balancing that piece with also making sure that there is some room for authorizers at all levels to determine determine that.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:41.000
So I don't have a specific answer for you about how that fiscal impact piece will be determined at the local level.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:47.000
But you're right. There are two separate, as you said, bites of the apple when it comes to fiscal impact.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:09:02.000
OK, I was afraid of that as a preview to what we're going to talk about the next item around verified data that I as I understood a lot of the intent around the clarification for charter law was to have some standard objective standards for decision making.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:08.000
So we don't get into this back and forth about just some districts operating certain way.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Others operating a different way. We're doing something different.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:26.000
It does seem to me that since there is a very clear definition, and as you said, Stephanie, it's a very cut and dried that we followed it for years with school districts about what their fiscal categorization is, if you will, positive, negative, qualified, that we should be following that.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:34.000
It just seems inherently unfair to give districts two bites of the apple on that one, but I will leave it at that.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000
The second one, I just and this, I think, is for you, Stephanie.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:48.000
I'm a little bit confused about the term the state board will no longer be an authorizer versus the state board will no longer be an authorizer.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:59.000
I'm a little bit confused about the term the state board will no longer be an authorizer versus the state board no longer providing oversight.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Because you talked about there's a specific process for board for charters that are currently SBE authorized and what we will go through for that.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.000
I assume they still have to go back to the local level.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Okay, so they go back to the local level.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:21.000
They try to get renewed by their district or by their county.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:29.000
If they're still not able to, they can come back to us again, right, for another for a final review.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:44.000
We do a de novo review and then we either say yes or no, which presumably makes us still an authorizer, but then we don't, meaning the department, doesn't provide oversight.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:51.000
So I'm just trying to clarify what the board role is with those charters that are currently authorized by the state.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:58.000
So let me clarify one little piece and then I'm going to turn it over to Judy, who has another piece to clarify.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:07.000
So SBE, current SBE authorized charter schools do go back to the district that they reside in to get authorization first.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
They don't have to go to the county.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:17.000
So if the district denies them, they come straight back to the state board for an appeal.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
So Sue, this is Judy.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:24.000
The state board is no longer considered a chartering authority under the law.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:42.000
So what happens is if the state board approves the charter school, an SBE authorized charter school because the district has denied, like Stephanie explained, then we have to delegate oversight to either delegate chartering authorization, I guess is the word, to either the LEA or the county office.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:49.000
And they will be responsible for hearing material revisions, everything regarding the charter school.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Even if the state under current law or previous law, we had the option of delegating oversight, but we still would have heard the material revisions and those kind of things.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:05.000
So this is getting the state, I think the intent was to get the state out of the oversight and authorization business.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:13.000
And then at their next renewal, then they would go to the district, go to the county and come up to the state board under an abuse of discretion standard.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:23.000
So they get one chance to come back to us under de novo review and then five years later, they will be just treated like all the other charter schools.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:37.000
And just my last one is sort of a technical one. We have heard this in the public comment, and I know we saw this in the letter, this concern about using the terms low performing, middle performing, high performing.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:47.000
I believe that's in statute, but I would like that clarified. And just as an editorial comment, I thought we got out of labeling schools when we got done with NCLB.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:57.000
So I share the concern about, you know, branding these schools, if you will, I get that you want to categorize them for purposes of additional review.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:04.000
That seems reasonable to me, but I just would express my support for not labeling schools.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Thank you, Sue. This is Cindy again. The terms low and high does appear in the law.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:23.000
We went we got back and forth on this actual phrase. We talked to not only the California Teachers Association, but the charter school CCSA.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:33.000
We talked to districts as well. And this this was actually a sort of a negotiated category just to make it really operational in the field.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:43.000
So while we I think share your concern for the labeling, because we know what NCLB has done or did and continues to do to schools.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:52.000
We just needed to make sure that this was very clear. But the low and high does appear in law as well as performance levels,

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:59.000
whether or not they appear and are very clear that these are the full name, like high performance levels.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000
I'm not sure that you would actually see that full phrase in there.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:13.000
But, you know, in the section, you see references to each of those labels throughout, with the exception of the middle piece.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Well, I would support trying to change that in statute. That's it for me, Linda. Thank you.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Thank you, Sue. I'm going to go to Ting next, and then Eileen has her hand up.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:31.000
And if others want to be recognized, just put your hands in the air, so to speak.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:42.000
I appreciate Board Member Sue going before me because she asked a lot of the questions that I had as well, specifically to the high, medium and low designations.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:52.000
I did go through and read and I didn't see those specific terms, but I'm sure it must be in law somewhere.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.000
But I would also encourage that we go back and take a look at that.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:08.000
We were very deliberate, not post-MCLB, not labeling schools with those types of categories.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:15.000
It was pretty consistent that when we were doing this, we could be a subset of schools under color school.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:23.000
So I would also encourage taking a look at that. I mean, just tier one, two and three seems to make sense.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:47.000
And then also, I also want to just support, as we are working on the implementation, looking at some objective standards by which we can provide guidance through the field so that there's some consistency with the authorizers looking at processes and information.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Your voice is kind of breaking up a little, maybe stay close to the mic.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Okay. Can you hear me better now?

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000
A little bit, yes.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Okay. So in addition to, so what was I saying, the objective standards and looking at some objective criteria.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:18.000
When we look down the road at the determining abuse of discretion, I think it would help us be in a better position to be able to determine that.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Anything else?

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
That's it, thanks.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Okay, great.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Eileen.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:37.000
So Sue and Ting, I just first thank you for the clarification and for all the analysis that staff has been working on this.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:48.000
I did have some questions on finance. I'm still not quite clear on it, but I'm assuming as we get closer to hearing these, we'll get some more guidance on that from our staff and council.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:17:08.000
I had a question on the presentation about if a charter did not serve local interests or duplicate services, could you clarify Stephanie or part of your team on what that meant or are we interpreting that in the law, what that means?

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Hi Eileen, this is Judy. That was within the definition of community impact, which we've been talking about a little bit.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Because it talks about how the chartering authority shall consider factors regarding measurable increases in achievement, the impact on the community as a whole that includes fiscal impact, whether duplication of existing services or programs, that's all caught up in the larger definition of community impact.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Or discussion around community impact definition is probably too strong of a word, but there's many factors to be considered within the community impact finding that Stephanie was talking about earlier.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:18:04.000
So does that mean that it could include, I mean, I'm sure we'll find out as we hear some of these, if there was a program already offered in a public K-12 school that the charter was offering that could take away from that, is that considered?

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Is that the type of thing that this means?

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:19.000
That is exactly the discussion we had last week at the regulation stakeholder meeting. How do you define community? Is community the district or is it something smaller, the neighborhood?

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:31.000
You can imagine an L.A. U.S.D. community would look very different than community might in Northern California. So that's what we're sort of balancing, whether we need regulations to further define it.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.000
And if so, how can we do it so that it covers the whole state?

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:48.000
And one other thing, you know, they're looking at existing programs within neighborhoods. Is it again the district? Is it similar programs across the whole district? So it's pretty complicated.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:19:00.000
And there's other parts to it, Eileen, that makes it even more complicated in terms of when these charters, if, for instance, a charter petition is denied and the findings are under community impact.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:13.000
How the county and the state board, if it comes up to us, can actually determine that since we don't live in that community. So that's another piece of it that will be challenging for us if they come up here on appeal.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:28.000
And the other thing, too, Eileen, I think Stephanie might have said this in a presentation that this community impact and the new fiscal impact finding the more there's the community impact includes fiscal impact and the separate fiscal impact finding that the FICMAC qualify negative.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Those can only be used when you're denying establishment of new charter school. They're not something that happens at renewal.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Right. More material revisions. Yeah.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
All right.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Any anything else on that.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Going to go to Matt, then I noticed that SBE slash LT has a hand up. I don't know.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.000
There's somebody on the state board.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:08.000
That's me. That's that's Patricia. Okay. So after after Matt will come to you, Patricia.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:21.000
I just want to thank number one. I think this is incredibly complicated. And I just want to thank Stephanie, all the team for laying it out so clearly. It really helped put a lot of missing pieces together for me.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:33.000
I want to echo board member Burr and Son, especially in relationship to the funding issue. And I think that's going to complicate things for districts and the more we can standardize and give them guidance.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:43.000
I think it's going to help. I also would agree that when I looked at the Ed code, it appears that that language does show up.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:58.000
As Cindy had pointed out that low track is defined. But if there is flexibility, I agree. I struggle with labeling schools as a result of what we lived through NCLB.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:05.000
My question is simple. I think it was in relationship to how this gets teed up to the board.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:29.000
And when I looked at slides 31 for the de novo review, it's been my short experience that we rely heavily on the ACCS to give us a sense as to what the their feeling is in relationship to the authorization or denying the petitions for charters.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:39.000
And I couldn't understand why in slide 33, there are different options. And the one that threw me off was make no recommendation to the state board.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:51.000
That throws me off because I think Stephanie in the past, the CDE has given the ACCS a recommendation. And then ACCS grapples with that neither affirms or denies.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:59.000
And so I'm confused as to how that would even come to us because it basically leads me to believe there's no decision.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Hi, Matt. This is Judy. That was in case there's a tie vote, for example, there have been situations at the ACCS where there may not be a quorum or there is a tie vote.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:23.000
So maybe it's a four, four vote. So they don't have an official recommendation because they don't have the votes. But the charter school appeal needs to continue to move forward.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:36.000
So there's not a delay in the state board hearing it. So in the past, what we have done when there isn't an official quote unquote recommendation from the ACCS, what CDE does is they list that in the item.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:43.000
They say the vote was, you know, five, you know, two, three or whatever it was. However, you know, there was not an official recommendation.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:50.000
So that that's all it is of case that they're they're unable to reach a decision because of a time.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:56.000
OK, thank you, Judy. And I assume they could have the tie in the de novo, but it didn't give them that choice either.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Right. It just wasn't clear to me. OK, OK. That makes sense. Thank you.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Patricia. Well, thank you very much. First of all, I also want to add my appreciation for the staff on the work that you have done as a department, as a unit, as a team to put this very complicated presentation together.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:42.000
This this is a conversation that while it's not long overdue, it's a conversation, a debate, a controversy that the people sitting on this panel have been living with and dealing with and working through for quite some time.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:24:03.000
And for a lot of times, each time that there is an appeal, we revisit with a great deal of frustration what it means to do this work, what it means to be fair and listening to and reviewing these appeals or listening to and making the consideration of creating a charter school.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:25.000
And as it was pointed out at the beginning of this presentation, the goal is to say what is look at the plain letter of plain writing and the plain statement in the statute and attempt to tell the board what is without going too far from to one side or the other in trying to interpret what's in the statute.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:46.000
And so I still hear some of the same frustrations we're having and some new ones that have arisen, particularly about the fiscal pieces. And so part of what I did, and especially when I listened to the people who called in for the public comment, and I forgot to say thank you very much for the people who made their statements on public comment.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:25:11.000
I did look at the statute and I did look at the legislative analysis that was done concerning the labeling of schools. It might be instructive to take a look at what the thinking was in the committees and with the legislators who did the work of offering amendments to try to resolve the conflicts and the issues concerning labeling schools.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Because there was a lot of effort to try to figure out the most neutral way to identify and compare and give a transparent way of evaluating what the status and performance of those schools were since academic performance is still the primary way of evaluating these schools when it comes to renewal.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:51.000
So I think it's worthwhile to take a look at that analysis. A lot of stakeholders, including the ones that Stephanie has referenced, were deeply engaged in that conversation and settled on and agreed on that particular language.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:26:14.000
I think it's also important to take a look at the issue concerning the fiscal analysis. Again, that took a lot of time. There was a lot of deliberation, a lot of discussion, and a lot of finally what came to be consensus, not only among the stakeholders but among the legislators who were the principals involved in crafting this policy.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:31.000
You know, nothing is perfect. There's no such thing as perfect. And I would like to see as we begin to do the work to implement this that we don't sacrifice the good because we're unhappy that we didn't solve the perfect.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:55.000
I think this is a good start that it has resolved some long standing concerns that have been arguments among the people on this day that have raised questions about what it means to do a de novo review, what it means to look at the board's role and relationship with local school districts in doing these appeals.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:24.000
So I think my mental model about what is supposed to happen, particularly with the fiscal review and whether or not that's two unfair bites at the apple, I don't happen to agree. So let's find out whether it's fair or not when we actually begin implementing and using these new processes to understand rather than to interpret whether or not we agree with or disagree with or try to identify and create our own interpretation on it.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:47.000
I think we have an opportunity to do some good work with policy on monitoring and creating a charter school community and a relationship among districts and charters that can be different than what we've experienced with the contentiousness and the automaticity of how people pick sides or define what it needs to be done to evaluate.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Not only good charter programs, but also how to deal with the conversation as charters come to the board to approve. So I think this is a good start. I think it's important for us to make sure we understand what the statute says, but I think it's a mistake to prognosticate on what the legislature got right or wrong or what we like or do not like.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:19.000
And we have not actually gone through the work of doing the regulations, of doing the implementation, and we're only hearing about it for the first time. So that's my comment for today.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Thank you. Cynthia, you are next. And then I don't see any other hands. I'm going to add a comment after yours and try to move us along, because this is an information item. So we're going to have to make big decisions today, but I do want everybody to get the understanding they need.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Cynthia.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Thank you. First, just to echo the appreciation of staff for everything that was done, also to underscore a concern about the labeling with the high, low. My understanding is we are not labeling any non-charter LEAs in that way. So, again, wondering if there might be a different terminology that can be used.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:31.000
My question is specific to the abuse of discretion review standard. On slide 26, there is some detail on the type of information that's to be considered. And I just wanted to know if staff could provide a little bit more clarification or examples as to what that might look like, what type of information would be looked at more specifically than what is identified on the slide.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Thank you, Cynthia. So yes, so abuse of discretion is a term that we have not yet defined. There are definitions for it, obviously legal definitions for it, but we have not yet determined whether or not that definition, that term needs to be defined in regs or if it's something that can be defined using legal terminology.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:30.000
So we're not there yet in terms of actually defining abuse of discretion, but it is clear that when a charter appeal comes up to us, the board must look at the documentary record, which will include the findings from the local boards, county and district, may include

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:49.000
some sort of transcript or video or audio of the actual meeting. There are pieces of the documentary record that this board will be reviewing to determine whether or not there was an abuse of discretion. I'm sorry I can't give you a clear definition today, but we will soon.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:31:06.000
So in that sense, you're looking at the documentary record versus what happens under a de novo review where you're actually looking at the petition and looking at the fiscal and all of the pieces that you used to look at. In this case, you'll just be looking at the documentary record.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:21.000
And there'll be a lot under the documentary record for you to review, but we don't have quite the definition yet. I don't know if Judy has anything to add.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:41.000
This is Judy. Yes, Stephanie's right. It is different because this is more a review of the documents that are submitted to the state board by the charter who's filing the appeal, and it includes the petition includes all like Stephanie said all of the action and documents that review by the district and the county.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:58.000
The district and the county also have an opportunity to file a written document that explains why they think there was not an abuse of discretion. It really is analogous, and I know we haven't done one of these for a while, but to how the board, the state board has been reviewing revocation appeals in the past.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:21.000
So in the revocation repeals, there's more a look at the findings by the district and the county as opposed to an independent review of the petition like Stephanie said, where you're looking at the program and making a determination whether the program is serving all students and it's more review of actually what was happening at the district and the county level.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Does that answer your question adequately? Yes, that does help. Thank you. Okay, and I see that Ida's hand is going up, so we'll turn to you, like the last comment and then move it on to the next item.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:33:03.000
All right, I just want to thank staff for breaking this down because it is very complex and for the questions and the, you know, the talk about labeling labeling schools, and I especially want to thank board member Rucker for her comments regarding the intent of the legislation and going back and looking at that.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:18.000
So this has been this has been incredibly eye opening and I appreciate all of the conversation today. Great. And I'm going to ask one more question before we move on.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:38.000
First, I do want to acknowledge the challenge of figuring out how to identify the categories, given the way that the law reads. I do want to also associate myself with the comments about trying to avoid that kind of labeling, given the other variables that are always in the mix.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:34:02.000
And, you know, part of what we did see during the NCLB era and we're still trying to find ways to acknowledge school progress and student progress is that schools that serve high need students are often than the recipients of low performing labels, even when they may have produced a lot of growth for their students.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:14.000
We will have a growth model at some point and that will be very helpful in part of, you know, in part of ameliorating that. But if we can think of another way to identify schools, I think it would be useful.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:18.000
And my last question goes to that point.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:35.000
One of the challenges that occurred in that era and that we're still working with is that to get higher levels of performance, whether a school is a charter or non-charter school, one way to accomplish that is to help students who perform poorly.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:45.000
And we had a long conversation about our alternative schools yesterday and that phenomenon is one that continues to be an equity concern.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:35:08.000
And one of the pieces of the law did talk to the point that someone brought up in the public comment about creaming and cropping, that there's a procedure to ensure that schools are admitting and keeping in students with high levels of needs in the same way that is expected of public schools.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:22.000
I'd like just like a very brief comment about how that piece of the law will be tracked a little bit more on that.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Darling Hammond, this is Cindy Kazanis again. So there is a requirement that we produce an enrollment data file.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:52.000
And while we didn't go into it in great detail, sure we can in another meeting, we have available on our public website the cumulative enrollment files which are required and then there's two other pieces of this section which looks at enrollment trends also with looking at CASP results.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:36:01.000
So that information is available for authorizers to request as specified in the education code for 1505.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:07.000
So the data files have been requested by several authorizers to use this year.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:10.000
We have run the data for the entire state.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:19.000
So if they wanted to ask for things in anticipation of a future renewal, that data is available again upon request.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:26.000
The one piece of data we're able to put out there publicly is the cumulative enrollment file.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:32.000
We can come back to that in another occasion. I know it will be complex.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:41.000
My understanding of the law is that a school could not be automatically renewed without that analysis having.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:47.000
But let's put that on a docket for a later conversation and we can learn more about it.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:52.000
With that, this is an information item. It's a lot of information.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:37:04.000
I really appreciate the work that the department staff has done and the state board staff to get us up to speed on this very complex piece of legislation which really does frame our responsibilities.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:15.000
And so we're going to move on to the next item. We will probably need a break at some point in that item because they also be an intense one.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:23.000
We're going to keep on moving and thank you very much, Steph and others who have given us all this good information.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Board members, we're going to move on to item 14, which is related to this discussion.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:46.000
It is approval of the criteria to define verified data and the list of valid and reliable assessments and measures of post-secondary outcomes as required by California Education Section 47607.2.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:55.000
And this item will be presented by Cindy Kazanis. This is a big morning for you, Cindy, and I'm going to let you sit down very much.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:03.000
And I'll let her share with you the CDE recommendation and you launch your presentation. Thank you.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:15.000
The conference has been unlocked.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Accountability Reporting Division. Sorry, I didn't turn on my microphone. Cindy Kazanis, Director of the Analysis, Measurement and Accountability Reporting Division.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:30.000
In following the footsteps of item 13, item 14 is before you today for action.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:41.000
You are required by January 1st, 2021 to adopt a list of verified data, and we're going to go into this in great detail today.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Before I get started on the presentation, I just wanted to provide some framing remarks.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Like other pieces of 1505, we have been meeting since July of 2019 to describe or rather to process how do we implement this law in the department.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:08.000
This section of the law, the department recognized early on, would be outside of the scope of the expertise of staff in the department.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:17.000
And so we submitted very quickly a budget change proposal to ask for outside help to move forward on this piece.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:27.000
And we were successful in getting some funding to contract with West Ed under the leadership of Deb Sigmund and Eric Crane to do this work on our behalf.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:33.000
And so you will see a report in the item from West Ed.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:41.000
They have been a terrific partner, thought partner, but also checking for understanding and providing us the technical expertise we needed.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Because this was a very short turnaround and also there's such an emphasis on the technical aspects of it, I also wanted to talk about how we approach this.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.000
We approach this like we do anything else in accountability.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:02.000
We look at it from the lens of making sure that what we're providing you is technically sound and valid.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000
We've reached out to stakeholders.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:12.000
We actually, as part of the West Ed contract, we asked them to develop a stakeholder group and meet with them.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:16.000
That was not required under the law, but we felt it was really important that we did that.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:21.000
We met with stakeholders on a couple of occasions and then after the item was posted, we met with them again.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:29.000
And so I just wanted to acknowledge that this piece of the law, as well as the other two pieces that my division has been a part of,

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:34.000
has been what you see at the result of this is hundreds of hours of work.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:40.000
I think yesterday somebody said that we've had the luxury of time because of COVID and we didn't have to produce a dashboard this year.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Well, we had to produce 1505 and we were fortunate that we had a couple of extra resources as a result of not producing a dashboard to direct this.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:58.000
But we did put some work on hold. And so this piece of legislation has been really all hands on deck.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.000
It's been a tremendous effort on the technical side.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:15.000
And so the result of what you see today was a cooperative effort throughout my entire division with support from our terrific staff in the legal division, in the charter school division, in the state board.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:18.000
This was an effort that we could not have done alone.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:27.000
We just like the other pieces, we went back and we checked for understanding on several occasions because this law does have different definitions throughout the law.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:35.000
And it's complex sometimes. And so we needed to make sure that we could actually operationalize again what you see today, not only an item 13 and 14.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.000
We also met on several occasions with legislative staff.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:44.000
And I think that's important because we weren't in the room when this law was negotiated.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:51.000
We're simply left with what you see on paper to actually implement.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:42:04.000
And so what you see is, again, our best effort to make this something that can be operationalized and bring before you based on sound technical arguments.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:13.000
So the report that I mentioned for WestEd is included in attachment one with recommendations in that attachment.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:28.000
After the agenda was posted, we met with our stakeholder group and there was a lot of concern around a couple of pieces, one being the lack of having CASP specified on the list of verified data.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:36.000
And so a couple of days ago, actually the day after election, the state board staff posted an addendum.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:50.000
So while you will not hear about the addendum in the WestEd piece of the presentation, I will go through each of the items that we've adjusted based on stakeholder feedback, based on the letters you received to make this, I think, more palatable for everyone.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:43:02.000
So we listened in this item to stakeholder feedback. We were open to constructive criticism. We've made adjustments accordingly.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:08.000
So the recommendation is that the state board approve the recommendations contained in attachment one of the addendum.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:14.000
You see the full recommendations in the addendum, which includes first the criteria to define verified data.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Second, the data use procedures related to verified data.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Third, the academic progress indicators for inclusion within the approved verified data list.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:32.000
And finally, the post-secondary indicators for inclusion within the approved verified data list.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:40.000
One of the revised recommendations that we would like to add and we're recommending that be added is the effective date.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:53.000
So our recommendation is the list is effective January 1st, 2021, but not required to be used by a chartering authority for charter school partitions received prior to January 1st, 2021.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:44:05.000
However, by agreement of the parties, the verified data adopted by the State Board of Education can be used prior to January 1st, 2021.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:18.000
So I mentioned in my remarks for item 13, I'm going to repeat some of those today so that you hear the full piece of this, that we began work in earnest on pieces of 1505

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:24.000
because we had to, of course, have the dashboard data put out for the current year.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:33.000
So December 2019, following the release of the dashboard data based on the results of the 2018-2019 school year,

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:43.000
we fast forward one month after the holidays to January and the work began in earnest on this.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:49.000
So as I mentioned in item 13, I'll go over this a little quicker this time.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Dashboard alternative school status, schools have their own renewal criteria per this education code section,

01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:05.000
and charter school authorizers shall consider performance on state and local indicators in the dashboard as part of that renewal process.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Additionally, as we mentioned in item 13, charter school authorizers must meet with the charter school during the first year of the charter school's term

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:22.000
to mutually agree to discuss alternative metrics to be considered and shall notify the charter school of the alternative metrics to be used within 30 days of the meeting.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Again, this is only relevant to charter schools.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:41.000
For traditional schools or non-charter schools, AB 1505 established new renewal criteria that is applied to them statewide, as you've heard in the previous item.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:51.000
It holds all charter schools to the same criteria and standards, and it also has the criteria places for charter schools in one of the three performance levels.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.000
And I appreciate the rich discussion from the last item.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:46:01.000
This list has been public since July 1st, and we have not heard those comments up until now.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:11.000
And so I think it was enlightening for us to hear that, again, the labeling that had been mutually agreed on by several of the groups still wasn't quite a good fit.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:17.000
So we'll take that back and try to figure out if we can do something different moving forward.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Additionally, the renewal process that the charter schools and authorizers are required to follow is dependent on their performance level that we've talked about.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:30.000
So I won't go into as much detail, again, as we reviewed this in the previous item.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:38.000
But the first thing we do is look at what we call criterion one, whether or not they're in the high or low, based on colors on the dashboard.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:44.000
So whether or not they hit that blue and green on all indicators, of which, again, we saw about 27 schools do that this past year,

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:48.000
and then the red and orange on all dashboard indicators, which we saw no schools reach.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Majority of them are in the combination, which they move to step two, which is the second page of this flow chart and which we then look at status and student groups.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:06.000
And so the high performing on the far left hand side, the presumptive renewal, brings it up to 72 schools.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:10.000
And then you have the low performing in this middle area.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:13.000
And we are now in the verified data piece.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:24.000
So we're going to spend the remainder of this conversation on what is verified data look like for low performing and middle performing.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:35.000
So just to be clear about performance levels and the use of verified data, here's the actual specificity in the law for you to look if you're interested.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Again, this was a rich discussion in item 13, so it sounds like it's worth going back and looking at those high performing schools are not subjected to verify data.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Middle performing schools are as well as low performing schools.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:52.000
So those are the schools that we're going to be looking at today.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:48:00.000
And here's the code section that tells you what's before you and why we are bringing this to you for action today.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:11.000
By January 1st of 2021, the state board shall establish criteria to define verified data and identify an approved list of valid and reliable assessments.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Further, the education code section states that verified data means data derived for nationally recognized, valid, peer reviewed and reliable sources that are actually produced and verified data shall include measures of post-secondary outcomes.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:36.000
You're going to see throughout this presentation we've tried to quote the law where we can to make sure that we're all using the same words and the same terminology.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:42.000
So first, a low performing school, the authorizer must consider verified data.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:51.000
The education code section states the chartering authority shall consider clear and convincing evidence showing either the following.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:49:00.000
One, a school achieved measurable increases in academic achievement as defined by at least one year's progress for each year in school.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:11.000
And two, strong post-secondary outcomes as defined by college enrollment persistence and completion rates equal to similar peers.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:17.000
For middle performing, the authorizer must also consider verified data, as we saw on the flow chart.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:21.000
And here is the education code section that's relevant to the middle performing.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:30.000
In addition to the state and local indicators, the chartering authority shall consider clear and convincing evidence showing either of the following.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:37.000
The school achieved measurable increases in academic achievement as defined by at least one year's progress for each year in school.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:44.000
And the strong post-secondary outcomes as defined by college enrollment persistence and completion rates equal to similar peers.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:51.000
You can see there are minor differences between the two. They're not directly, they don't have the exact same language.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:50:05.000
So with that, there is limits on the data available for use, which is why I think it was really important that we consider adding CASP, which we're presenting in our addendum.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:08.000
So, increased academic achievement.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:16.000
AB 1505 defines the increase of academic achievement as having at least one year's progress for each year in school.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:25.000
And post-secondary outcomes, AB 1505 defines them as college enrollment persistence and completion rates equal to similar peers.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:35.000
The law does not define similar peers. The law also does not reference career technical education as a post-secondary outcome.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:50.000
So with that framing in mind, I'm going to turn it over to my colleague, Eric Crane from WestEd to introduce the remainder of this section of the slides and I will move your slides for you, Eric.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Great. Thank you, Cindy.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:59.000
President Darling-Hammond, Chief Deputy Superintendent Gregson, and distinguished members of the board.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:07.000
I'm Eric Crane, Senior Researcher at WestEd and Director of WestEd's Charter Verified Data Technical Support Project.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Before I begin, I need to thank my colleagues who worked on this.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:19.000
I have the honor of presenting today, but it really is as much of their work as anyone's.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:30.000
So, a big thanks to Ryan Lewis, Sylvia Kwan, Tran Keys, Kathy Hunsiker, Mark Greenfield, and Deb Sigmund.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:36.000
So, in this project, what did we do? Next slide.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.000
The project had four key components.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:50.000
A big part of it was analysis. We looked at possible indicators that met the statutory definition and could serve as verified data.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:57.000
We convened. We brought stakeholders together to get feedback about verified data.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
We wrote up what we found.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:07.000
And as today is an example, we're presenting findings. So those are the four key parts of the project.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:13.000
Next slide.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:16.000
I wanted to give an overview of the timeline.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:25.000
As Director Kazanis described, the work goes back quite a bit before the middle of 2020.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:32.000
But in terms of the specifics of when WestEd became involved and could begin on the work,

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:40.000
our work began on July 1st when the EdCode sections went into effect.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Early on, the department, in partnership with state board staff, identified stakeholders to take part in the verified data work.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:53:03.000
At the end of July, we reached out to test publishers and asked them for technical evidence that would be reviewed for our academic progress indicators review.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:07.000
It doesn't show here, but I'll just include that in early August, we did some surveying.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:13.000
We surveyed stakeholders to make sure we understood their issues, concerns, what was on their mind.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:27.000
And also in early August, we did a statewide data landscape survey that was pushed out by Director Stephanie Farland and her team to all the charter schools in the state.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:33.000
And we basically inquired about what assessments they were using for progress monitoring.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:39.000
So I'll talk about that a little later, but I wanted to talk about that and mention it now in the timeline.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:42.000
We did an update report at the end of August.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:48.000
And then in September, the beginning and the end of September, we had our two stakeholder meetings.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:59.000
And September was very busy for us as well doing that analysis work, looking at the technical evidence that had been submitted by the test publishers.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:04.000
In October, we put together our report and here we are today with the state board meeting.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:11.000
And of course, you see if there's any cleanup or technical revisions, we'll do that to close out the process.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:15.000
But January 1st is sort of the day we're all heading to.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:23.000
That's the date and statute where the board needs to have established criteria for verified data.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
So that's the timeline.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Next slide.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
I won't read through all these names.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:40.000
I think a number of these names are going to be familiar to the members of the board and the public who's been engaged with this issue.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:50.000
If the names of the individuals themselves are not familiar, certainly the organizations they represent will be familiar to you.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:53.000
These thoughtful professionals, they've been in the arena.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:57.000
They've been engaged in charter issues for a long time.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:04.000
And in our stakeholder meetings, they brought their expertise and their passion to the discussions.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:13.000
I will say that folks did not always agree competing points of view on a number of issues.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:24.000
But I do want to call out that at a time when passion often overflows and bleeds into something less than respectful discussion,

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:32.000
this group maintained a real high level of engagement and a real respectful level of engagement.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:39.000
And so I think they deserve a lot of the credit for pushing the process forward.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:43.000
Next slide.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:50.000
So as we went about our work, we kept these things in mind.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:58.000
Charter schools and authorizers should not have to be psychometricians to be able to do this work.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:03.000
A high level of assessment expertise should not be needed to do this work.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:16.000
However, the school should be able to at least describe test administration procedures and other non-technical factors that relate to school performance.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:27.000
And lastly, this was not an exercise in finding a best assessment or a best post-secondary outcome measure.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:31.000
We really centered our work on a fundamental question.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:41.000
And that is, could the assessment reasonably be used to inform the question of did the school make one year's progress?

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:52.000
And in the case of post-secondary, could this be used to establish strong post-secondary outcomes and relative to similar peers?

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:57.000
So this was not about a ranking exercise.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:02.000
And I should say that this was, we looked at it for this purpose.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:10.000
So when we considered issues of validity, we were looking at validity for this question at hand.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:15.000
Next slide.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:23.000
So the central task of the Board is to establish the criteria for verified data.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:35.000
And so in talking about the criteria, I think it'd be interesting and helpful to the Board to share that, you know, initially, our perspective was what was in statute,

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:44.000
that these potential indicators had to have validity, reliability, be evidence-based and be aligned to standards.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:48.000
We brought a kind of a very technical focus to the task.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:58:00.000
And the stakeholders really pushed back and articulated a different view and kind of expanded how we were thinking about criteria.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:04.000
And they said that, no, the criteria need to be more than that.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:16.000
We need to talk about the data sources, but also get into how the data would be used or else there'd be confusion or inefficiency, maybe misapplication.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:25.000
So that the work of defining criteria would need to speak to the data themselves, but also to get into issues of data use.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:33.000
And I'll say some more about that on the next slide.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:44.000
To underscore the point, the technical focus alone would not be sufficient to be useful to the field, would not be sufficient to clarify how verified data would be applied.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Making the discussion of data use explicit would be essential.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:59:02.000
And some of the concerns they had included misapplying verified data or the vagueness or multiple interpretations about data and how it could be presented.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:15.000
And I think this is going to be familiar to members of the board where you have to set broad guidelines while still allowing for local control and local application.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:25.000
So I think we wrestled with some of these issues about where those lines would be and then ultimately this type of issue comes to you all.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:39.000
So as much as we tried to game through and think through every possible use case, and I think the stakeholders were very helpful with that with many of the examples they brought up.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:45.000
In a state as diverse as California, there are going to be some examples that we missed or could not anticipate.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:56.000
But I think everyone brought an intentionality to the work to be as precise as we could be given the diversity of California.

01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Next slide.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:06.000
So with that, and I will say that these are elaborated in the full item.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:23.000
But with that, we recommend the following criteria to define verified data, data eligibility, participation, disaggregation, student groups, and methodology.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:33.000
And for this, like I said, the full criteria are explained in the board item.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:43.000
And I think the recommendations here do reflect a lot of the input from the stakeholders.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:49.000
And as you can see, it's much more than just the initial technical focus that we have.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:55.000
It's actually some clarification and elaboration about those points.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:03.000
Next slide.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:19.000
When it comes to the data use and the added specificity around the application of the data, we recommend the following procedures.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Flexibility, that is to say that there's not a particular data source that's compelled to be used, multiple measures, and that the charter school and authority can be discussing more than one aspect of verified data.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Transparency, that the charter school and authority should have access so they can see what data the other side is talking about and talking through.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:02:10.000
Security, particularly for the assessment results or the assessment administration, that the assessments be administered in keeping with the administration and security provisions of the test publisher.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Longitudinal progress, that results be of the same group over time.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:29.000
The differences from CASP, that the discussion include some understanding of why the results might look different from CASP results.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:43.000
And comparability, and again, particularly for post-secondary outcomes, where you're looking relative to similar peers, that you can be able to compare results across schools.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:48.000
And again, each of these is also explained in the full board item.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:03:05.000
I'll point out here that the department's addendum goes into a couple of additional data use procedures as well, one relating to CASP and another relating to the pandemic and natural disaster considerations, and I think the department's going to speak through those.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:09.000
Next slide.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:22.000
So I want to explain a little bit about what we did process-wise and how we got to our technical review on the assessments.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:34.000
For the academic progress indicators or the assessments, we reached out to publishers whose assessments are widely in use in California charter schools.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
We had a few different ways of knowing this.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:49.000
We do work in this area, and so we had considerable internal expertise about what was being used as progress monitoring or periodic assessments in the schools.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:04:00.000
We did speak with the California Charter Schools Association and the Charter Schools Development Center and inquired about what were the main assessments in use in California.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:06.000
And both of those sources were supported with this data landscape survey that I referenced earlier.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:16.000
So again, in early August, again, with the help of Director Farland, we pushed out the survey and asked, what assessments are you using?

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:21.000
And some 74 different assessments came up through that process.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:24.000
We did not contact fully 74.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:36.000
They needed to either arise out of our discussions or in the survey to have at least a minimum threshold of use in the state before we reached out to them.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:39.000
But some 74 different assessments came up.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:44.000
Next slide.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:50.000
Yeah, this infographic goes into a little more depth about the process.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:05:02.000
In the leftmost box, what we're calling round one in this slide, we identified and contacted 12 publishers, and you can see the list there.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:06.000
These came up consistently.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:14.000
But in the data landscape survey, we saw that we hadn't really reached all of those that were in wide enough use.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:21.000
These additional ones met our threshold for additional contact.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:24.000
That brings the running count to 16.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:38.000
And then round three, this one I say with some amusement is that a 17th publisher caught wind of this process and proactively reached out to CDE and asked, you know, what's this all about?

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Can we get in on this?

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:45.000
And so they proactively, you know, asked to be involved.

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Ultimately, not all of these 17 assessment publishers submitted technical information for our review.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:06:00.000
About 13 of them did.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:03.000
And I'll say a little bit more in a moment.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Next slide.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:12.000
This simple flowchart shows our process.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:16.000
We did a very quick scan called here and referred to here as initial review.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:30.000
We did a quick scan to see did they provide enough to merit our deeper dive into the material and a yes, no.

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:37.000
Assuming that they did, and I believe all of them did and passed the initial review, they moved on to phase one.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:07:05.000
And for that, we looked at a, we had a rubric that we adapted from some other related work, but customized it to the example here and looked at whether there was technical evidence supporting that the assessment was evidence-based, valid for this purpose, reliable, and aligned to California standards.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:21.000
From there, we asked, could the assessment results be used to make a judgment about whether a school was making one year's growth?

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:35.000
And if it met all of those conditions, then it makes it to the approved list, a no at any stage in the process, and the assessment's not recommended for addition to the approved list.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:41.000
Next slide.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:50.000
So as I mentioned, the, I guess 12 is the number, the 12 assessments came in.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:08:03.000
I think there was a 13th in that when our reviewers looked at the data submitted, the technical evidence was a little different on the ELA side than on their math side.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:13.000
And so for the accounting, I think 12 became 13. With that, that was, I believe, the submissions from Let's Go Learn.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:21.000
The raters were trained on the rubric, and we had two independent reviews conducted for each assessment.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:33.000
We had a third rater standing ready to conduct a review if the first two reviews failed to agree after some discussion about their reviews.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:37.000
And the reviews were completed in early October.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:43.000
Next slide.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:51.000
So the technical quality rubric had a lot of different elements to it.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:09:05.000
And, you know, I'm not going to read through them here, but you can see that it was pretty comprehensive in that we needed to establish validity, reliability, alignment to standards, and appropriateness for different populations.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Next slide.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:27.000
Furthermore, we reviewed for things like bias and fairness, you know, what sort of technical procedures were done to review the assessments for that.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:36.000
Scoring and reporting, you know, what sorts of security and data privacy procedures were in place for the assessments.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:43.000
So a pretty comprehensive technical quality rubric.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:49.000
Next slide.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:10:01.000
At the end of this process, some 13 different assessments we are putting forward for the recommended list.

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:17.000
And these here you can see the, for those that are familiar with the periodic assessments in place in California, a lot of these will be familiar to you.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:27.000
You'll see here also the separate reading assessments and math assessment from Let's Go Learn that I alluded to earlier.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:35.000
But these are the assessments. You'll also see here the inclusion of LPAC.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:50.000
LPAC was cited by a number of schools as a way that they track progress and for a charter school with a large or perhaps universal English learner population.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:11:05.000
That may be an appropriate way to look at a year's growth of students together with other measures as well.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Next slide, please.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:21.000
So having walked through the academic progress indicators, I want to turn now to the post-secondary indicators.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:35.000
As Director Kazanis mentioned, there was concerns and we had some of our own about career technical ed measures and their absence from this process.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:47.000
However, the law is very clear on this point, clear and convincing evidence of increases in academic achievement or strong post-secondary outcomes as defined by college enrollment, persistence and completion rates.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:57.000
So as important as career tech ed measures may be, they're not part of this particular process.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:03.000
And I feel like it's important to call that out for the board.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:08.000
Next slide, please.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:14.000
So this is the process we brought to the post-secondary indicator review.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:18.000
It's going to look very similar to the academic progress indicators.

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:28.000
We were looking for data sources that were nationally recognized, valid, rigorously reviewed, reliable, externally produced.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:38.000
If they met those criteria, then was it a source of college enrollment, persistence and completion rates?

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:53.000
So something like a career tech ed measure at an early stage, FAFSA participation came up as a candidate, but it needed to be a measure of college enrollment, persistence or completion rates.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:13:00.000
And could it be used to compare to similar peers?

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:05.000
And if the answers were yes along the way, then the data source is recommended.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Next slide.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:21.000
This is the process we took. We did a scan of national practices and strategies for tracking college enrollment, persistence and completion.

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:28.000
We talked to experts on post-secondary data for California students.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:45.000
And we looked at the feedback that came up from our stakeholder meetings, as well as what was indicated in the data landscape survey as to what charter schools were already doing to look at post-secondary indicators.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:55.000
So this was, in a way, more about researching and scanning.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:14:13.000
This did not have the same technical rubric as the assessments did, but rather it was subjecting the possible candidate indicators to whether they could be used to look at strong post-secondary outcomes.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:41.000
It's a good time to mention that where the academic progress indicators were looking for one year's growth or one year's progress for a school, the post-secondary indicator language in statute is strong post-secondary outcomes as measured by enrollment, persistence and completion relative to similar peers.

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:54.000
So very, very different. One year's growth, an absolute standard, and then there's a sense of more of a comparative standard of strong outcomes with the post-secondary indicators.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:15:02.000
And so having done that, next slide, please.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:13.000
Having done that, we're recommending that these post-secondary indicators be considered for verified data.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:32.000
CalPASS+, CSU Enrollment Dashboard Student Origin, DataQuest College Going Rate, National Student Clearinghouse Student Tracker, UC Admissions by School Source, and UC Undergraduate Graduation Rates.

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Next slide, please.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:47.000
So in the course of our work and largely driven by things we heard from the stakeholders, a couple of topics deserve additional mention.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:16:07.000
We heard a lot of concern about what's data going to be like in the 2020-2021 academic year and what is strong performance when there's learning loss going on as well.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:23.000
For the work that we were doing, it was not for us to weigh in or make a judgment on that, but we did feel it important to document that as an issue as this verified data work is going forward.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:33.000
A second topic was this idea of ways to re-examine data other than the way they initially come.

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
And we had a couple examples of that.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:41.000
So the Lexile Quantile Framework came up, and this is a way of reporting results.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:50.000
It's not an assessment per se, but it's a reporting convention, a reporting methodology, if you like.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
That was one.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:56.000
Another one that came up was Core Student Growth Percentiles.

02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:10.000
Again, not an assessment per se, but a reporting convention or a reporting methodology to generate some useful information from an existing assessment, obviously.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:14.000
CASP data in the case of the Core SGP methodology.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:27.000
So those, again, special topics that deserve mention, but in this case, not assessments as such.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:30.000
And that's the work that we did.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:33.000
So next slide.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:36.000
Yeah, happy to entertain any questions.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:37.000
Thank you, Eric.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
All right. Thank you very much.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:44.000
We have a couple more slides to go, and I can turn it over to you if that's okay.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Great.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:51.000
So there are a couple other pieces of this before we go into what the addendum is proposing.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:18:03.000
The first is this law also has a caveat in here about recognizing that the board was working at the time and still continues to work on developing and reporting a student level growth model.

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:18.000
And as you all know, because we've updated you, I think, at every single meeting this year, we are on track to bring forward to you in March of 2021 a student level growth model for adoption.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:26.000
As a result, the CDE may bring forward changes to the verified data criteria and the specified code section.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:40.000
I'll read out loud. Upon adoption of a pupil level academic growth measure for English language arts and mathematics, the state board may reconsider criteria adopted pursuant to this subdivision.

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:50.000
Additionally, there has been requests and in keeping with what we've been doing with 1505, the other data elements, we wanted to make you aware of these these two additional pieces.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:19:04.000
So I think it's important, as Stephanie mentioned in item 13, that we'll continue to come forward to you or provide you information memorandums on the implementation of this legislation and specifically around the verified data process as needed.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:16.000
And then we will, in concert with WestEd, conduct a technical assistance webinar once you've adopted the verified data as proposed or whatever you adopt with today's action.

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:22.000
So that will be forthcoming to support the field to implement this piece of 1505.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:30.000
With that, I want to turn over to the item addendum and I want to walk briefly through the changes that we are suggesting be made.

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:45.000
The addendum again was posted on Wednesday. It's available under item 14. Specifically, I did read out loud already the revised recommendation about the effective date of the verified data list being January 1st, 2021.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:54.000
When we look at the criteria to define verified data, there are no changes made to data eligibility.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:20:02.000
The suggested changes participation changed the words all to instead at least 95 percent.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:09.000
And the reason for that is it's in keeping with what is required under federal law around participation rates.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:19.000
So it's consistent with what we expect of our schools for our English language arts and mathematics assessments on our smarter balance.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:31.000
The other areas where we are recommending some additional changes is around data use, specifically under security, adding in some additional information,

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:38.000
specifically the words consistent with the test publishers administration and test security procedures.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:43.000
Just again, to be very clear about expectations around security.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:21:00.000
Further, we added a section about the use of the CASP data for English language arts literacy and mathematics, specifically the following specified CASP reported data can only be used in a manner consistent with the data reported on the CASP.

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:14.000
website and the California School dashboard CASP data and methodologies for analyzing CASP data that are mutually agreed upon by the chartering authority and charter school may be used to supplement dashboard results.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:20.000
However, CASP data may not be used to dispute the dashboard results.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:27.000
An additional item that we are recommending be added is around pandemic and natural disaster considerations.

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:40.000
Specifically, the charter school may present evidence of learning disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic and or natural disasters for petitions considered in the 2020-2021 school year.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:51.000
And then finally, under the recommendations for academic progress indicators, the department is recommending the addition of the CASP English language arts and literacy mathematics.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:22:00.000
With that, I wanted to make sure that I acknowledged the contributions from our assessment division, originally under Michelle Center, who helped guide us to where we are today.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:11.000
And then currently under Malvang and Eric Silbert, Eric is here today if there's technical questions that neither Eric, the other Eric Crane nor Jenny or I can respond to.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:15.000
So I just wanted to acknowledge that they've been a tremendous help in this area.

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:22.000
And with that, I will turn it over to President Darling-Hammond for the remainder of the item and for public comment.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:33.000
Terrific. Thank you. Thanks for all the very, very helpful and strong work that's gone into this item and for all the additional thinking that went into the appendix.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:50.000
And I'm glad that you sort of referenced the fact that when we have our growth model, we will be kind of revisiting the criteria because this really came about in part because people were looking for ways to show growth.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:55.000
So that's going to be a good revisit very soon.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:59.000
The public comment slide is up.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:05.000
And for those who want to call in, the phone number and the access code are there.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:15.000
I think we should take a 10 minute break while people are queuing up for public comment so that we can kind of refresh our brains when we come back.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:27.000
We'll take a moment to hear from our liaisons, then go to public comment and then we'll move forward into the rest of the public comment and discussion.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:35.000
I am aiming for us to complete our work by hopefully around one o'clock at the latest.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:38.000
So we'll try to move things expeditiously.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:45.000
Let's take 10 minutes now. It's 1135, 1136. We'll give ourselves to 1146.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:53.000
If you need a little snack to munch on while we're doing this, do that as well and we'll see you in 10 minutes. Thank you.

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
Okay. Thank you very much.

02:23:55.000 --> 02:24:03.000
We're going to continue with item 14, but we need to reestablish our quorum. So Brooks, can you call the roll?

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:04.000
Of course.

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
Member Sun.

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:07.000
Here.

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
Member Strauss, Vice President Strauss.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:10.000
Here.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:14.000
Member Rucker.

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:15.000
Here.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
Member Rodriguez.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:18.000
Here.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:21.000
Member Patil Bronson.

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:22.000
Here.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:23.000
Member Navo.

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:24.000
Here.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
Member McQuillan.

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:27.000
Here.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
Member Glover Woods.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:30.000
Here.

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Member Fatah.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:33.000
Here.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
President Darling-Hammond.

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:36.000
Here.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:37.000
Member Burr.

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:38.000
Here.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
Everyone's present.

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:57.000
All right. So we'll soon have people queued up for public comment. I wanted to give our liaisons, members Burr and Sun, an opportunity to do some framing comments before we take public comment. Sue?

02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:19.000
Thank you, Linda. First, just my deep appreciation and thanks to the department staff, the board staff, and to West Ed. I hope you could tell by the presentation that this has been not only a lengthy process, but certainly a very thorough, thoughtful, and comprehensive process to arrive at this point.

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:37.000
Again, not an easy statute to interpret some conflicting language, but I think the department and the board came to a good spot on this, and I would just ask people to really take a look, a careful look at attachment one that's posted as the addendum.

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:47.000
Cindy referred to that a couple of times, and I think that following public comment, this will be the document from which we will work for purposes of emotion.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:48.000
Thank you.

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
Perfect. Thank you.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:51.000
Cheng?

02:25:51.000 --> 02:26:17.000
Yeah, I just want to also echo the good work of the staff and the staff really embraced our continuous improvement philosophy in this process and taking in input and feedback and going back again and trying to resolve a lot of the differing opinions, and I agree that, you know, we've come to a place where I think

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:27.000
gives us at least a start to move forward, and I would only encourage that we continue to work on this continuous improvement aspect as we work on implementing this law.

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:31.000
Perfect. Thank you. Is there public comment?

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Yes, at this time we have 17 individuals in the queue for public comment. Callers, just a quick reminder, this is public comment for item 14 only. Again, item 14 only.

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:59.000
Good afternoon. First caller, please speak your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:10.000
Good morning. This is Derek Lennox on behalf of the Association of California School Administrators. I want to start by thanking the board for the opportunity to participate in the CDE stakeholder group on verified data.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:20.000
The recommendations are well researched and we support the addendum amendments, especially the 95% participation rate and test security requirements.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:33.000
On balance, we also appreciate that the recommendations endeavor to not overly burden authorizers in charter schools, but the other side of that coin is the need for both parties to have objective standards around using the data.

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:44.000
We respectfully encourage the state to provide technical guidance, especially around creating outcome benchmarks and aggregating student performance data at both the student group and school level.

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:47.000
Thanks so much for your time.

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:56.000
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:05.000
Good morning, honorable board members and Superintendent Thurmond. My name is Julia Hollins and I'm the Public Programs Manager for Green Dot Public Schools.

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:17.000
In my role, I lead Green Dot's compliance efforts with our authorizers and state agencies. I'm calling today to urge you to include CAST data and core student growth percentiles on the state's verified data list.

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:27.000
Seven of Green Dot schools are currently going through a high-stakes renewal process while simultaneously navigating a data desert due to COVID-19 and the suspension of testing.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:35.000
Being able to include a peer-reviewed data source, such as core student growth percentile, has been invaluable to Green Dot's renewal during this time.

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:49.000
Green Dot operates middle and high schools where students enter multiple grade levels behind. Core clearly demonstrates that our schools are accelerating growth for all students, regardless of their incoming achievement level or their zip code.

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:57.000
I urge you to please include CAST and core student growth percentiles on this iteration of the verified data list. Thank you.

02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:13.000
Caller, you're live.

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:22.000
Good morning, honorable board members and Superintendent Thurman. My name is Michael Garner and I am Green Dot Public Schools Director of Data and Analytics.

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:28.000
I've had the privilege of participating in the Department of Education's Verified Data Stakeholder Working Group.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:34.000
We've spent hours discussing the merits of various data sources with people who know the data most intimately.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:43.000
I urge you to heed the stakeholder group's recommendation and include CAST data and core student growth percentiles on the verified data list.

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:52.000
As the highest governing board in California's education system, you have the ultimate authority to decide how we determine which schools are good schools.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:30:03.000
During a time with limited data available, core student growth percentiles have the unique ability to show which schools are accelerating student growth using an apples to apples comparison.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:15.000
Core is particularly helpful in highlighting the success of schools like Green Dot Schools that serve students who enter multiple grade levels behind and show significant growth once enrolled at our schools.

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:19.000
The board will have multiple opportunities to visit the verified data list in the future.

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:30.000
So I urge you to include CAST data and core student growth percentiles on the verified data list so schools can make the most of the data available to us and ensure good schools like ours are given a fair shot.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:33.000
Thank you, caller. Your time is up.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:42.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record, please.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:47.000
Hello, President Darling-Hammond and members of the board. I'm Ruth Stetten with Clovis Global Academy.

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:52.000
I urge the board to reconsider the PDE recommendations that extend beyond statutes.

02:30:52.000 --> 02:31:08.000
The proposed verified data criteria limit the data an authorizer must consider and prescribe processes for data presentation that are so difficult as to be nearly impossible for many, especially if implemented right away without giving charters the chance to operationalize systems in preparation for renewal.

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:14.000
Restrictions could mean that authorizers may not hear the important story of the value added by charter programs.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Clovis Global Academy is the dual language immersion charter school.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:23.000
Our students' gains in bilingualism and biliteracy will not show on the dashboard or CAST.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:29.000
However, this learning is highly valued by our families and will contribute to better lifetime outcomes for our students.

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:35.000
The CDE should not be so confident that the verified data criteria fully captures school quality or student learning.

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:46.000
I urge the board to only accept the list of assessments to clarify the term verified data to remove any restrictive language that would inhibit the visibility of charter's value added.

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:51.000
As we consider an appropriate timeline for implementation so we do not harm public access.

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:55.000
Thank you, caller. Thank you. You've reached your time limit.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:32:06.000
Also, callers, a quick reminder, if you are listening to the live stream, please mute your computer while you're speaking live on the line.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Next, caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:18.000
Hello again, this is Suzanne Cooey of the Charter Schools Development Center.

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:24.000
The criteria need vetting, limiting CAST data to the dashboard and CAST website formats.

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:31.000
Distance from standard, percent proficient, and scale scores are crude proxies for one year's progress.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:35.000
And for schools, are often way off on that standard.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:38.000
Also, the COVID provision misses the issue.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:43.000
What is one year's progress for K-5 schools with mostly high-need students?

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:51.000
We should compare to how similar students do statewide in COVID, but it's not clear what analysis the criteria even allow.

02:32:51.000 --> 02:33:00.000
At stakeholder meetings, I raise the issue that criteria might not simply operationalize statutes, that it might guide sound data use.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:06.000
Instead, 10 restrictions were added that don't help with the most important issues.

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:10.000
The proposal preempts authorizers' local control to evaluate data.

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:16.000
Adds burden, is ambiguous, and goes far beyond statute, including listing post-secondary sources.

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:22.000
See, that statute calls for the board to stop the assessment. This narrows the view of college and devaluing...

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:27.000
Thank you, caller. You've reached your time limit. Thank you.

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:37.000
Next caller, please list your name and or state your name and affiliation for the record, please.

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:40.000
Hello again, honorable board members and Superintendent Thurmond.

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:45.000
My name is Helen Lopez, and I am the manager of data and analytics for Green Dot Public Schools.

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:51.000
I am calling today to urge you to include tax data and core student growth percentiles on the verified data list.

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:58.000
I spend hours pouring over data with our principals to support them in their efforts to accelerate student growth.

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:04.000
Unlike other K-12 education systems, Green Dot only operates middle schools and high schools.

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:10.000
Students enter our schools, multiple grade levels behind, and our schools do everything in their power to catch them up.

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:14.000
Schools like ours need multiple measurements to show true growth happening every day.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Unfortunately, there is limited data available due to COVID-19 and the suspension of testing.

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:27.000
Core student growth percentiles offer a readily available data source that clearly measures a school's ability to grow students.

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:34.000
I urge the board to amend its verified data list and include available data sources such as CAST data and core student growth percentiles.

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:37.000
Thank you for your time. Thank you, caller.

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:48.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:54.000
Caller, you're live on the line. Are you there?

02:34:54.000 --> 02:35:06.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:14.000
Caller, you're live on the line. Are you available?

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:22.000
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:27.000
My name is Tim Warner. I'm the director of Alder Grove Charter School in Eureka, California.

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:32.000
We largely serve high-need students who will not choose the traditional college route.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:37.000
The statute's intention seems to be adopting assessments to be used for renewal criteria,

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:43.000
so I'm concerned that the discussion has turned towards considering post-secondary success using a narrow list,

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:49.000
including the National Student Clearinghouse and very traditional college data sources.

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:54.000
This limited information unfairly ignores our student data from those who serve in the military,

02:35:54.000 --> 02:36:00.000
participate in career technical education and apprenticeships and internships not tracked by the Clearinghouse.

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:05.000
In other words, our authorizer will not be allowed to consider our school's above-average progress

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:09.000
on post-secondary educational paths compared to those of similar peers.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Please consider allowing flexibility to capture the important post-secondary outcomes that our students need if you value that work.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:19.000
Thank you for your time. Thank you, caller.

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:31.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:36.000
Caller, are you on the line?

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:45.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:50.000
Hello. My name is Enrique Rocha and I represent San Diego Unified.

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:56.000
We submitted a letter on Item 14 that requested the addition of the CAS to the list of verified data.

02:36:56.000 --> 02:37:03.000
We thank you for the submission of the addendum, which adopts our request and urge your approval of the item with the addendum.

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:09.000
We also highlighted in our letter the need to adopt regulations that implement the use of verified data

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:13.000
and the need for technical guidance on the use of verified data.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:20.000
While Item 14 briefly addresses issues of comparability and the longitudinal progress,

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:31.000
we encourage the discussion on the impact to forthcoming regulations that should contemplate the use of the assessments as a part of the implementation of AB 1505.

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:38.000
The regulations are necessary to ensure the effective implementation, ensure clarity on the use of assessments,

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:47.000
and ensure authorizers are able to perform meaningful analysis of any alternative measures of academic progress within a charter school.

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
Thank you for your consideration.

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:56.000
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:37:56.000 --> 02:38:02.000
Hi. My name is Romali Antoine. I'm part of the California Charter School Association.

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:12.000
I wanted to first thank CDE, the staff, and specifically Carrie Lopes for the work that you all have done in this entire process.

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:18.000
It has been a truly collaborative process where the stakeholder input has been taken into consideration,

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:27.000
as exemplified through the addition of the addendum to ADCAS and the core student growth percentile in this consideration.

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:35.000
We do want to remind the board that the board does have the ability to revisit this in the future as we move forward,

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:45.000
as we know that COVID-19, in addition to other data restrictions, will necessitate perhaps that the board will reconsider this as we move forward.

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:56.000
So we look forward to this collaborative process as we continue to go through the implementation of 1505 and 1507 and urge your approval with the addendum. Thank you.

02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:02.000
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:11.000
Good afternoon. My name is Michael Juba, speaking on behalf of the California Teachers Association.

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:16.000
CTA appreciates the stakeholder's work and the extra work put into the item 14 addendum.

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:23.000
And while the statutory deadline is looming, there are policy issues that must be rectified prior to moving forward.

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:32.000
Many of the recommended assessments are not valid for the purpose of high stakes decisions and are unable to aggregate growth at the school or district level.

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:40.000
The use of the CAS and LPAC can be considered with the guardrails regarding data use procedures in the addendum.

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:47.000
Ed quote is clear that the baseline is one year's progress for each year in school.

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:55.000
That is very different than just one year's growth for some students. Test security must go beyond affirmation.

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:59.000
Outreach to authorizers and charters must be comprehensive and ongoing.

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:09.000
The CTA believes that the issues I've outlined must be addressed prior to the adoption of the recommend list so that it is in alignment with California standards and accountability.

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:14.000
Time. Thank you, caller. Thank you for your comment.

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:23.000
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:28.000
Good afternoon, Madam President and members. This is Eric Premack with the Charter Schools Development Center.

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:40.000
We appreciate the recent addition of the CAS data to the list, but we have a number of outstanding concerns that remain unaddressed that were in our letter and some new ones, particularly the confusingly worded restrictions on CAS data.

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:47.000
We also remain alarmed by the prohibition on the use of career technical and military participation data.

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:59.000
We'll note that the Webster's Dictionary definition of the word college includes instruction in vocational and technical fields and that any other interpretation we think is absurd and bad policy.

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:09.000
We would urge you to reopen these issues and reengage the stakeholder group before finalizing these regulations or these lists. Thank you.

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:16.000
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:27.000
David Patterson, California Charter Authorizing Professionals, otherwise known as CCAP. Thank you for the opportunity to address the board today.

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:35.000
We appreciate the complexity of this issue. We have submitted a letter. I have three quick points to make.

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:47.000
First, we appreciate on the addendum the inclusion of CAS data. Our second point is about supports needed for all verifiable data sources.

02:41:47.000 --> 02:42:02.000
The data sources being recommended by WestEd and any other additional data sources that are included in the final action by the state board need to be accompanied by the technical resources and guidance to ensure that they're appropriate and reliable use.

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:10.000
None of these assessments were originally created to be used as a critical source of data to support high stakes authorizing decisions.

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:22.000
While authorizers are committed to meeting these difficult responsibilities, it's important that they have the support they need to ensure they can use these and other data sources in an appropriate and defensible manner.

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:37.000
Tom, thank you caller. Your time has ended. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:46.000
Madam President, members of the board, Superintendent Thurmond, my name is Dolores Duran-Flores and I represent the California School Employees Association.

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:58.000
We share the concerns raised by CTA, our teacher partners. It's our understanding that the publishers indicated that six of the recommended assessments don't have an option to aggregate at subgroup or school level.

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:04.000
This puts authorizers in a position of having to conduct a level of analysis they may not be able to provide.

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:14.000
We're also concerned about test security and believe charter schools should be required to provide the authorizer with a report outlining all information about test security and regularities in security.

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:20.000
We urge you to address these issues prior to adopting the recommendations for you. Thank you.

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:30.000
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:37.000
Hi, my name is Rich Harrison. I'm the CEO of Lighthouse Community Public Schools here in East Oakland.

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:42.000
I want to just share that one of our schools fell into the low track and we're up for renewal this fall.

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:55.000
We're in deep East Oakland where when you look at the neighborhood schools, 12 out of the 14 schools in the neighborhood that are public schools would have fallen into the low track for the calculation of AB 1505.

02:43:55.000 --> 02:44:02.000
Additionally, in the two zip codes we serve, we have COVID rates that are three to four times of that of Alameda County.

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:11.000
We were able to work with the district to get a positive two year recommendation for 1505 because we were able to share our core data as well as our map data.

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:22.000
And I'm glad these are on the list. However, we need to make sure that the language in the language of the assessment criteria is clear and stronger.

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:36.000
I suggest removing some of these restrictions so that we ensure there's flexibility in both the charter school as well as their authorizers to better assess the continuity of their program relative to the neighborhoods and the communities they serve.

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:43.000
Thank you so much. Thank you, caller. This concludes public comment.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:48.000
All right. Thank you very much.

02:44:48.000 --> 02:45:02.000
At this point, we are open to have a discussion with the board, and I will look for hands to go up.

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:09.000
I would maybe start us off with one clarifying question and then others can chime in.

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:13.000
Cindy, don't go away.

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:16.000
One of the things that thank you very much.

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:19.000
And once again, thanks for all the work that went into this.

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:24.000
One of the questions that came up was about the acknowledgement of other post secondary outcomes.

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:39.000
In addition to college going, is there, in the way that this is framed, is there, as you view it, a prohibition against using, considering other data like that?

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:48.000
I just changed the slide deck to slide 16, which provides the language in education code, which we guided our work.

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:56.000
It says it defines post secondary outcomes as college enrollment, persistence and completion rates equal to similar peers.

02:45:56.000 --> 02:46:01.000
I believe Eric Crane covered this a bit in his presentation as well.

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:04.000
So we felt constrained by this language.

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:10.000
We know that there are technical schools out there, and that would be considered part of the college enrollment piece.

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:16.000
And I'm also going to turn this now over to Judy Sias to provide some additional explanation.

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:22.000
My question is really about whether the law prohibits us from using other data beyond those that are.

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:33.000
The law also specifies that verified data must be nationally recognized, valid, peer reviewed, and reliable sources that are externally produced.

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:42.000
And I think the board remembers from some of our many discussions around the college career indicator that there are not a lot of career indicators that meet that part of the definition either.

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:45.000
So there are two constraints.

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:53.000
Yeah, so let me just be sure I'm asking my question clearly and that I understand the answer fully.

02:46:53.000 --> 02:47:04.000
Is the law written in such a way that the authorizer and the board are prohibited from considering any additional data beyond those that they've asked to find in this?

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:16.000
The board cannot adopt verified data that does not meet the definition that is on the slide, the state board.

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:21.000
Right. And I guess I'm still going to try one more time to be sure I understand.

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:30.000
Are we prohibited from considering in authorizations or reviews any data that are not verified?

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:42.000
I would certainly present data that they feel shows performance levels, but whether or not the authorizer has to consider it as another story.

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:54.000
I mean, that's part of the reason for the verified data is to cabin a little bit what type of data that is considered at renewal in order to.

02:47:54.000 --> 02:48:00.000
I think we've talked about the data wars over the years, so I think the intent was to emphasize college.

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
I think there's a clear intent to emphasize college.

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:13.000
I think at the beginning of your statement, you said what I what I understood the law to be saying, which is that you could that charters could provide other data.

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:17.000
The authorizer must consider verified data.

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:27.000
It is optional whether they consider other information that so to speak.

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
Is that right? Thank you.

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:33.000
So it's not prohibited, but it is not required to be considered.

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
That's correct. I think that's right.

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:46.000
OK, I just want to be sure that we're clear on that, because this evolved initially as a way to charters have traditionally provided a lot of information.

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:54.000
About the way in which they do their business, they're asked to show a variety of inputs and processes and outcomes.

02:48:54.000 --> 02:49:10.000
I don't think this takes things off the table for a presentation, but it does not guarantee if it's not verified data that it will always be considered because it may be difficult to interpret if it's outside these parameters.

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:20.000
I'll now open up to other questions. I see Eileen, Ting, Patricia, and that's it for now. Eileen.

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:24.000
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond.

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:32.000
I wanted to follow up on the post-secondary verified data as well, and I appreciate Judy and Cindy and your clarifying.

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:41.000
My concern, and I guess this is in AB 1505, is that schools are not only required to show academic growth K-12.

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:58.000
It sounds to me like they're also required to get their kids into college, show some persistence and completion rates beyond their time with the students as compared to similar schools, similar peers, but that's not defined.

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:07.000
And that's not a standard that we have held for accountability. When we've looked at college and career indicators, we've looked at A to G completion.

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:24.000
So this adds a new layer. And for many charter schools, I think they're serving, as we've heard from some of the public comments, a challenging population that we're trying to get high school completion and some other post-secondary preparation available.

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:35.000
So I just, so I just wanted to talk a little bit more about that and then ask if we could or if we are planning to revisit this, like in 12 to 18 months as this evolves over time.

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:51.000
Is this an area that concerns me since it's complicated once students are no longer with the K, the high school, for example, students three or four years later having graduate, but they're not even seeing the kids or supporting them anymore.

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:56.000
So I'll turn that over to Cindy first and maybe Judy for some comment on that.

02:50:56.000 --> 02:51:13.000
Can I piggyback another question on it that will just again give us the framework? Is it correct that schools do not have to present all of this data? These are data that they may present and this provides a way by which they are looked at.

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:17.000
The authorizer shall consider this data. That's what the statute says.

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:26.000
If it is presented, but are you are you framing this as a must present these data?

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:35.000
Right before the two items, it says in addition to the state and local indicators, the chartering authority shall consider clear and convincing evidence showing either the following.

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:44.000
A, the school achieve measurable increases in academic achievement as defined by at least one year's growth and B, the post-secondary strong post-secondary outcomes that you see on the slide.

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:50.000
So I don't have this together on one slide, but that is the preface to what you see on the screen.

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:58.000
And you're interpreting that as saying that the schools must provide additional data beyond that.

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:12.000
I was trying to respond to member Strauss's question because this this language says either of the following and she she she combined the two as the one year's one year's progress as well as at least that's why I understood her question to be.

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:24.000
So Cindy, are you saying so, for example, alternative schools that are having students that may not have been successful in high school charter schools, they're trying to get them to complete high school and have some post secondary options.

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:28.000
They can use academic achievement and completion data.

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.000
And this doesn't apply to DAS schools.

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.000
None of this applies to DAS schools.

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:34.000
Those are removed from this entire process.

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:42.000
The alternative schools defined as DAS that have been accepted into that process are removed from this entire process.

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:52.000
Okay, but a K-12 non-DAS school would have to consider how their students do after them as an indicator of how well they prepare them.

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:53.000
Is that correct?

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:54.000
Either.

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:59.000
Either the academic measurable, the cheap measurable increases in academic achievement.

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:02.000
And then second piece is the strong post-secondary outcomes.

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:03.000
It doesn't say both.

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:04.000
It says either.

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:05.000
Okay, Anneleen.

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:06.000
Thank you.

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:07.000
All right.

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:08.000
Ting.

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:16.000
So, yeah, I'm going to drill down a little bit more in trying to understand what's going on in the post-secondary outcomes.

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:26.000
So, and I think it might be helpful to maybe have staff to sort of look at what's going on in the post-secondary outcomes.

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:40.000
So, yeah, I'm going to drill down a little bit more in trying to address the concerns with some of the callers around the narrowness of the list that we would be approving for under-verified data sources.

02:53:40.000 --> 02:54:08.000
So, and I think it might be helpful to maybe have staff distinguish the difference between the lowest performing tier of schools, because looking at the law, it sounds like that the authorizer is prohibited from renewing a charter school in that level unless there is verified data.

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:17.000
And then further it says no data sources other than those adopted by the State Board pursuant to paragraph two shall be used as verified data.

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:30.000
So, in essence, the only list of verified data that can even be considered for that lower tier is what is defined by the State Board, what we will be approving.

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:46.000
Now, for the middle group, where I am unclear is whether there is discretion in looking at more information than that, because in that section, it does reference verified data.

02:54:46.000 --> 02:55:03.000
But in it goes into subdivision C, which is the whole section that talks about what verified data means and also includes the paragraph no data sources other than those adopted by the State Board pursuant to paragraph shall be used as verified data.

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:21.000
So, while I know I'm hearing that there could be other sources that an authorizer can consider, that's not the case for the lowest performing, and I don't think it's very clear for the middle group of charter schools.

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:31.000
So, I don't know if there's anyone who might want to be able to do that. And excuse the phone behind me.

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:50.000
The law is not clear. We know this. I'm just the law is not clear. I think what West Ed and CDE have done is to try to, as we've talked about, work within the parameters of the law and identify a broad range of assessments that can be used.

02:55:50.000 --> 02:56:06.000
As you heard from Eric, they did a very thorough work of identifying data. I did not hear anything from any of the callers of other pieces of data that should be added other than the college and career, which we've been talking about.

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:27.000
But the goal was certainly to provide as much discretion and as much choice. We did the survey of hundreds of charter schools of all the assessments that they are using so that we would make sure, West Ed did, in order to help make sure that all the assessments that charters identified were put through this process.

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:49.000
And then that, again, that was the addition for the CASP data piece. So, I think the revisiting point is certainly a good one. We didn't put a date certain in the item to revisit, but certainly no one is thinking that this list doesn't, you know, I think everyone knows that we will want to revisit this at some point in the future.

02:56:49.000 --> 02:57:04.000
As more data becomes available, but we have the January 1st deadline. And I know authorizers and charter schools, as we heard from the testimony, they're ready for this and need this as we move forward in the renewal season.

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:31.000
I do understand that. And I think this may be the start because of the deadline. I just want to make sure, because it is unclear, that we aren't limiting to what, we're limited by the law and we're limited by this list, and the authorizers are limited by the list that we adopt.

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:57.000
So, and we know that in consideration of the renewal of schools, it's multifaceted. I know that we need to follow what the law says. I think that also that implementing the implementation of this is very difficult and very constraining when we've got various aspects.

02:57:57.000 --> 02:58:07.000
So I just want to be clear that while we're saying no, of course, authorizers can consider other data. I'm not sure that the law actually allows that.

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:17.000
We can certainly go back through and look at doing some guidance, and this might be something we'll add to our list of things that we're looking at as we're doing regulations.

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:20.000
Thank you.

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:22.000
All right, thank you.

02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:24.000
Patricia?

02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:37.000
Thank you very much. I listened with great interest to not only the detailed analysis and presentation from WestEd, but also the concerns that were raised by the stakeholders.

02:58:37.000 --> 02:59:02.000
So I want to, first of all, thank and acknowledge the stakeholders for the information and the concerns that you raised. You heard me say this before in response often to the stakeholder testimony that many people are often frustrated that you only have a minute to speak, but there was a lot of very powerful assertions made, particularly about this particular process.

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:11.000
And I also want to thank the staff at WestEd for the work that they did in providing this advice, both of the board and the department, for us to work on this.

02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:28.000
So here's the thing. Again, I want to hearken back to what I said earlier, that we are starting to implement this, and there are going to be a lot of questions about what it is we are doing.

02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:37.000
And while there is a goal not to take a purposeful misstep, I think that there needs to be an assumption that we need to revisit it.

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:51.000
So the first thing I'm going to suggest is, in the same way that we keep saying, we need to revisit our 20-year-old board policy concerning non-classroom based charters, and we never get around to it.

02:59:51.000 --> 03:00:05.000
Since we know that this is something we absolutely need to review, I would like to suggest we amend the recommendation to include a date certain or a timeline for doing that review so that we can revisit.

03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:22.000
And I'm not just suggesting that because of salutary neglect on some other policies that have allowed to languish, but primarily because while many people feel that the list of verified data that the board is about to approve is very narrow,

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:45.000
I am amazed at how broad and how long the list is, and I'm using the word broad on purpose just so that it's antithetical or the exact opposite to what others have said about how narrow it is, primarily because we need to be able to understand not only how these items on this list will work,

03:00:45.000 --> 03:01:00.000
but in concert to all the multiple metrics that are being proposed for us to consider, are some going to work better than others, and we need to have the flexibility because while everybody is concerned about what the statute doesn't allow us to do,

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:12.000
I actually think the statute is giving us a great deal of flexibility to consider and revise this definition of the contents of verifiable data over time.

03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:22.000
I think we have that flexibility. And while the statute didn't explicitly include career technical education, it didn't exclude it either.

03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:37.000
You know, it must be reminded that the University of California has done a lot of work to identify how career technical education courses meet the A to G requirements or enrollment or admission consideration to their programs.

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:51.000
So while the statute doesn't explicitly include it, it doesn't exclude it either, and it doesn't mean at some point down the road that the board can't look at metrics and ways to include career technical education.

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:58.000
We just don't understand and don't have the understanding about how to use this metric at this time to do it.

03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:16.000
So I would like to recommend that we take a look at how the statute gives us some flexibility to make this decision as mandated by January 1st, but also to look at how to study this, how to monitor it, and come back to revisit this decision we made.

03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:26.000
This is not a decision that has to be carved in cement. This is an offer or marble or whatever other hard subject substance like granite that people carve things in.

03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:37.000
But I think there's an opportunity for this to be a living activity, a living document, a living policy that can be revised, improved and enhanced over time.

03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:46.000
But we have to be purposeful and plan for revisiting it.

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:47.000
Thank you.

03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:49.000
Thank you.

03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:56.000
I think we're going to go on to Kim.

03:02:56.000 --> 03:03:13.000
Sorry, I just want a clarifying question about, and this follows up on your earlier comment around whether core district data would be permissible still under this, but not required.

03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:20.000
I think it's the same as the secondary, post-secondary data that we were discussing before, but wanted to confirm.

03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:41.000
This is Cindy. So that piece is covered under the data criteria use that we've added for CASP, specifically CASP data and methodologies for analyzing CASP data that are mutually agreed upon by the chartering authority and charter school, may be used to supplement dashboard results.

03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:51.000
As you heard from West Ed, core is not an assessment and it's considered, you know, this is the way we've captured that information.

03:03:51.000 --> 03:04:02.000
So that's in the addendum number eight under data use.

03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:07.000
Sue?

03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:14.000
Thanks. I've already spoken. So if other people want to make comments, I don't want to usurp their time.

03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:15.000
But I just wanted to-

03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:18.000
You are the last one in the queue right now.

03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:24.000
Okay. Well, okay. So I will just say at the beginning, I'm prepared to make a motion when we're ready.

03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:32.000
But I do also, I just want to kind of reinforce both what Ting and Eileen said about the post-secondary outcomes.

03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:45.000
I do think both, I think Eileen's point that they're really much stronger or more rigorous in my reading of them than what we have in the CCI for all schools.

03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:56.000
That we don't require schools to be responsible for persistence rates in college when they have no control over those students once they've left.

03:04:56.000 --> 03:05:05.000
So I just, I think we might want to think carefully about that definition in the statute and see if there's more flexibility that can be obtained.

03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:23.000
I also think Ting's concern about the way the interaction of those sections in the statute makes it appear on a close read that you cannot use metrics other than those that are defined in statute and other than those that we might be adopting here.

03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:42.000
So I think, again, that is ripe for additional consideration as we move forward, whether it's a statutory change or some kind of clarification in our regulations, because I do think, and I'm very sympathetic to the callers and the commenters in our letters about schools that are serving.

03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:59.000
And these are not DAS schools, Cindy, so I understand what you're saying, but regular high schools who are sending kids onto apprenticeships, onto the military, onto other post-secondary opportunities that are not defined as college.

03:05:59.000 --> 03:06:02.000
So I think we just want to be open to that.

03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:22.000
And to member Rucker's comments, I agree with you. I think we will, for better or worse, be revisiting this regularly, but I think we can get commitment, especially from the department and the board staff, that for sure we need to revisit it once we adopt our growth model, because that will have an interaction with some of these things as well.

03:06:22.000 --> 03:06:28.000
So I agree with you. I think we need to keep coming back to this and refine it as needed.

03:06:28.000 --> 03:06:40.000
So with that, Linda, I'm ready to make a motion that we adopt the department's revised recommendation as outlined in the addendum in attachment one of item 14.

03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:42.000
Thank you very much. Do we have a second?

03:06:42.000 --> 03:06:44.000
I will second.

03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:46.000
Thank you very much.

03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:49.000
Further discussion by the board?

03:06:49.000 --> 03:07:01.000
I'm going to add just one comment and ask Cindy to go back to the previous slide that you were showing, which I think it was not that one. It's the one that says the authorizer shall consider for low performing.

03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:04.000
Low performing is the title.

03:07:04.000 --> 03:07:06.000
There we go.

03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:08.000
Let's consider verified data.

03:07:08.000 --> 03:07:24.000
I think just to reinforce the point that I think Sue was making, and we will likely want to revisit this, we have a very thoughtfully selected group of assessments that have met criteria that are well laid out.

03:07:24.000 --> 03:07:38.000
The question of when authorizers can or must consider certain kinds of data and when charter schools must provide those data is one that I think we'll want to clarify as we go along.

03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:59.000
I know that this particular piece of the law was written to say that if a charter school wanted to present additional data in that context, that the authorizer must consider it, did not require charters to have to present additional data beyond what is routinely provided.

03:07:59.000 --> 03:08:09.000
The question about what is required and when and how other things can be considered is one that Sue and Ting and others have noted we should clarify that.

03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:25.000
But in the meantime, we have a very strong, well-defined list of assessments that people can begin to think about using and I certainly support the recommendation.

03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:32.000
Any other discussion from board members before we vote?

03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:34.000
Matt, your hand went up, I think.

03:08:34.000 --> 03:08:35.000
Yep.

03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:47.000
I just want to thank fellow board members for the comments and it really helped clarify things and I think it would, before we vote, I just want to thank Cindy and CDE team.

03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:50.000
This is really tough when you're having to balance so many stakeholders.

03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:59.000
You can tell that they worked really hard to try to find a means so that we could move forward on this particular item and I appreciate their efforts.

03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:05.000
Yeah, and it's a challenging law to interpret and I think we're well on the way.

03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:08.000
Any other comments from board members?

03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:12.000
All right, we'll take a roll call vote.

03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:13.000
Brooks?

03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:14.000

03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:21.000

03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:33.000
Member McQuillin?

03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:34.000
Yes.

03:09:34.000 --> 03:09:36.000
Member Glover-Woods?

03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:37.000
Aye.

03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:39.000
Member Fatah?

03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:40.000
Aye.

03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:42.000
President Darlene Hammond?

03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:43.000
Aye.

03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:45.000
Member Burr?

03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:46.000
Aye.

03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:49.000
The pass is unanimously.

03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:50.000
All right.

03:09:50.000 --> 03:09:59.000
Thank you so much and thank you Cindy and the entire team for all of the important work that went into these last couple of items.

03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:08.000
We did general public comment yesterday so I now adjourn our November 2020 State Board of Education meeting at 12.36 p.m.

03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:15.000
Thank you and I look forward to seeing you all in the New Year at our January 2021 meeting.
