WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.540
Good morning everyone, seeing that all the board members are now present, Brooks, would

00:08.540 --> 00:12.040
you please call the roll to establish a quorum?

00:12.040 --> 00:13.680
Good morning all.

00:13.680 --> 00:14.680
President Darlin Hammond.

00:14.680 --> 00:15.680
Here.

00:15.680 --> 00:16.680
Member Escobedo.

00:16.680 --> 00:17.680
Here.

00:17.680 --> 00:18.680
Vice President Glover-Woods.

00:18.680 --> 00:19.680
Here.

00:19.680 --> 00:20.680
Member Lewis.

00:20.680 --> 00:21.680
Here.

00:21.680 --> 00:22.680
Member McQuillan.

00:22.680 --> 00:23.680
Here.

00:23.680 --> 00:24.680
Member Olken.

00:24.680 --> 00:25.680
Here.

00:26.680 --> 00:27.680
Member Roscoe-Gonzalez.

00:27.680 --> 00:28.680
Here.

00:28.680 --> 00:29.680
Member Petillo-Brownson.

00:29.680 --> 00:30.680
Here.

00:30.680 --> 00:31.680
Member Porter.

00:31.680 --> 00:32.680
Here.

00:32.680 --> 00:33.680
Member Rodriguez.

00:33.680 --> 00:34.680
Presente.

00:34.680 --> 00:35.680
Member Yoshimoto-Towry.

00:35.680 --> 00:36.680
Here.

00:36.680 --> 00:37.680
Good morning.

00:37.680 --> 00:38.680
Gracias todos.

00:38.680 --> 00:39.680
All right, very good.

00:39.680 --> 00:42.680
So we're now going to reopen item one.

00:42.680 --> 00:58.760
So we're now going to reopen item one to take action on the preliminary report of actions

00:58.760 --> 01:07.000
draft July 2022 meeting minutes and to have members report on their liaison assignments.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.960
And while we're waiting for any members of the public to call in, so I think we need

01:10.960 --> 01:17.440
to show the public comments slide if we could.

01:17.440 --> 01:23.880
Do I have a motion from a board member to approve the July 2022 State Board of Education

01:23.880 --> 01:27.120
draft preliminary report of action meeting minutes?

01:27.120 --> 01:28.120
So moved.

01:28.120 --> 01:29.120
Thank you.

01:29.120 --> 01:30.120
Is there a second?

01:30.120 --> 01:31.120
Second.

01:31.120 --> 01:38.040
Okay, someone can figure out who said that first.

01:38.040 --> 01:45.680
With that, are there any public comments?

01:45.680 --> 01:51.960
We'll give it a little moment of wait time once you are breathing.

01:51.960 --> 01:54.400
There are no public comments at this time.

01:54.400 --> 01:55.480
All right.

01:55.480 --> 01:58.480
Any further discussion?

01:58.480 --> 02:02.560
Seeing no hands going up, Brooks, can we call the roll call vote?

02:02.560 --> 02:03.560
Yes.

02:03.560 --> 02:07.800
And for the record, we have Vice President Cleverwood seconding that motion.

02:08.560 --> 02:09.560
Thank you.

02:09.560 --> 02:10.560
President Darling-Hammond.

02:10.560 --> 02:11.560
Aye.

02:11.560 --> 02:12.560
Member Escobedo.

02:12.560 --> 02:13.560
Aye.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.560
Vice President Cleverwood.

02:15.560 --> 02:16.560
Yes.

02:16.560 --> 02:17.560
Member Lewis.

02:17.560 --> 02:18.560
Yes.

02:18.560 --> 02:19.560
Member McQuillan.

02:19.560 --> 02:20.560
Aye.

02:20.560 --> 02:21.560
Member Olken.

02:21.560 --> 02:22.560
Yes.

02:22.560 --> 02:23.560
Member Roscoe-Gonzalez.

02:23.560 --> 02:24.560
Aye.

02:24.560 --> 02:25.560
Member Patilio-Brownson.

02:25.560 --> 02:26.560
Yes.

02:26.560 --> 02:27.560
Member Porter.

02:27.560 --> 02:28.560
Abstain.

02:28.560 --> 02:29.560
I was not present.

02:29.560 --> 02:30.560
Member Rodriguez.

02:30.560 --> 02:31.560
Aye.

02:31.560 --> 02:32.560
Member Williams.

02:32.560 --> 02:33.560
Yes.

02:33.560 --> 02:34.560
Member Williams.

02:34.560 --> 02:35.560
Yes.

02:35.560 --> 02:36.560
Member Williams.

02:36.560 --> 02:37.560
Yes.

02:38.320 --> 02:39.320
Yes.

02:39.320 --> 02:40.320
Member Yoshimoto-Towry.

02:40.320 --> 02:42.320
I was also not present.

02:42.320 --> 02:43.320
Abstain.

02:43.320 --> 02:44.320
Motion passes.

02:44.320 --> 02:45.320
Thank you.

02:45.320 --> 02:46.320
Thanks very much.

02:46.320 --> 02:51.400
So now I want to invite the state board members to report on their liaison activities that

02:51.400 --> 02:55.200
are not related to any items on our September agenda.

02:55.200 --> 03:01.640
And occasionally we also have announcements that you want to bring to the board.

03:01.640 --> 03:05.880
So I will call on the new members in case you have anything you want to add at this

03:06.000 --> 03:10.840
moment and soon you will also be in the liaison lineup.

03:10.840 --> 03:14.120
But let's start with member Escobedo.

03:14.120 --> 03:17.480
Great.

03:17.480 --> 03:22.400
I was part of the NASB meetings.

03:22.400 --> 03:30.040
We had a couple of meetings and discussed some of the proposed increases in Title I,

03:31.040 --> 03:38.320
which hopefully will help all of our schools in our district.

03:38.320 --> 03:43.000
Also they have a conference coming next month.

03:43.000 --> 03:51.200
I wasn't going to attend but I was asked to do a presentation on our work and CUS on Tier

03:51.200 --> 03:52.200
I, Tier II.

03:52.200 --> 04:03.760
And I will be presenting, I guess, as a board member and as a university professor as well.

04:03.760 --> 04:05.720
And that's with NASB.

04:05.720 --> 04:12.800
And what's really interesting in the discussion is each representative from the states a lot

04:12.800 --> 04:17.640
of issues on staffing that's happening throughout the nation.

04:18.200 --> 04:25.880
I find it unfortunate that many states are taking a, I think, a real short-sighted view

04:25.880 --> 04:34.920
on facing this problem by just accepting people with bachelors to become teachers and encouraging

04:34.920 --> 04:47.240
that without giving much focus on the necessary pedagogy and just so many complexities that

04:48.440 --> 04:54.760
you know, to be a successful classroom teacher that is being circumvented in many of the states.

04:55.560 --> 05:01.160
But definitely it's an issue happening throughout our nation.

05:01.880 --> 05:07.800
I'm also liaison through West Ed and they're looking at, you know, these similar issues

05:07.800 --> 05:16.520
and they're working on a different design, I believe, through Arizona called reimagining

05:16.520 --> 05:27.240
the workforce, which is looking at definitely focusing on more of the mentor-teacher approach,

05:27.960 --> 05:36.680
working with more of a group class where students get to be with social workers

05:36.680 --> 05:45.320
throughout the day and students rotate with physical education, the arts.

05:45.960 --> 05:52.760
So teachers may have more kids in their roster, however, they see

05:55.000 --> 05:59.320
smaller class size throughout the day because of the rotation that they've created.

05:59.320 --> 06:07.400
So West Ed is looking at that as a possible staffing issue, looking at just a different

06:07.400 --> 06:13.720
design on how we educate students, I thought, that has potential, at least.

06:14.520 --> 06:22.360
I've also been part of the regional English language specialist meeting,

06:24.120 --> 06:35.640
a lot of discussions on our state with our EL students and a lot of issues on learning loss

06:36.360 --> 06:43.960
and also the necessity of enhancing staff development throughout the state,

06:43.960 --> 06:52.680
specifically with ELD designated instructions, seems like they conducted a survey and that's

06:52.680 --> 07:00.680
the most significant gap that's happening throughout our state, which connects me with

07:01.560 --> 07:11.800
Dr., our presenters, focus on the importance of that type of instruction just because

07:12.840 --> 07:24.760
how that is connected to redesignation. So I believe that that was my report for the last

07:24.760 --> 07:33.240
couple of months. Thank you so much. Vice President Glover Woods.

07:34.440 --> 07:39.960
Thank you. I am liaison for both the advisory commission on charter schools and the California

07:39.960 --> 07:45.560
practitioner advisory group and we have items with recommendations from both of those groups

07:45.560 --> 07:51.960
on our agenda. So I'd just like to take this time to thank those who serve on those commissions for

07:51.960 --> 07:57.960
their participation in last month's meetings, the discussion and recommendations are things

07:57.960 --> 08:04.840
that definitely have helped to inform us as a board as we have moved forward on those particular

08:04.840 --> 08:09.400
items. So thank you again to those who serve on both of those commissions.

08:10.040 --> 08:18.280
Last week I had the opportunity to attend the 2022 annual roundup of California educational

08:18.280 --> 08:25.080
organizations and this roundup was hosted by CASA, which is the California association of

08:25.080 --> 08:30.520
African-American superintendents and administrators. I do want to share with you that the event was

08:30.520 --> 08:36.120
very well attended. There were educators, parents, community members that were present.

08:36.920 --> 08:42.120
Also included in the lineup of speakers were a couple of members of staff from the California

08:42.120 --> 08:47.880
department of education, deputy superintendent Cheryl Cotton and also director William McGee.

08:49.080 --> 08:55.640
Also included in the lineup of speakers was our own attorney general Rob Bonta and he spoke around

08:55.640 --> 09:01.000
school safety. So some of the topics that were discussed kind of as a springboard for ongoing

09:01.000 --> 09:08.920
discussion this year were transforming California schools, prioritizing students with the greatest

09:08.920 --> 09:14.920
needs, universal pre-k, whole child wellness and again school safety. So it was a very

09:14.920 --> 09:20.520
wonderful event. Definitely look forward to the convening next year and would invite all

09:20.520 --> 09:25.160
of my fellow board members to participate next year if your schedule should so allow.

09:25.960 --> 09:31.560
My last comment is just to reiterate a comment made by President Darling-Hammond during her opening

09:31.560 --> 09:38.200
report yesterday, which is to share that the recruitment period for upcoming vacancies on

09:38.200 --> 09:43.640
ACCS, which is the advisory commission on charter schools, CPEG, which is the California

09:43.640 --> 09:49.640
practitioners advisory group and the instructional quality commission, also known as the IQC.

09:50.360 --> 09:56.840
The recruitment for all three of those upcoming vacant seats has begun. So please if there's

09:56.840 --> 10:03.160
anyone interested in being considered for a seat on one of those commissions, I invite you to visit

10:03.160 --> 10:10.360
the website, the CDE SBE website for more details and the application. And just a reminder,

10:10.360 --> 10:16.600
the application deadline does close on September 23rd and that concludes my report. Thank you.

10:20.440 --> 10:22.680
Thank you so much. Member Lewis.

10:22.680 --> 10:33.000
Yes. Good morning. I have not been part of any groups that I am the liaison to any meetings over

10:33.000 --> 10:37.560
the last couple of months. We haven't had any, but I do look forward to the future meetings.

10:37.560 --> 10:43.560
I kind of feel like I'm slacking here compared to the reports that came before me, but I do look

10:43.560 --> 10:48.680
forward to when those committees and groups begin convening again and I can participate in those

10:48.680 --> 10:54.360
meetings. But I would just like to just give a shout out to all of the students, the parents,

10:54.360 --> 10:59.960
the staff, administrators, and hope they had a great opening to the school year and I wish

10:59.960 --> 11:06.360
the best for all in the upcoming year. And thank you. That ends my report. We're all entitled to

11:06.360 --> 11:12.440
a summer vacation and some of those committees needed a break. So we'll hear more in the next

11:12.440 --> 11:20.680
round. Member McQuillin. Yes. Good morning. I'm dealing with a little bit of allergy and some of

11:20.680 --> 11:28.280
the smoke this morning. So pardon me if I have to clear my throat. But a little bit of an update

11:28.280 --> 11:35.240
from the committee known as the California Workforce Pathways Joint Advisory Committee.

11:36.040 --> 11:41.720
The committee is comprised of a couple of our members from our board and a couple of members

11:41.720 --> 11:49.960
from the California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office, also known as the CCCCO. So

11:51.080 --> 11:59.080
when you think about this committee, think of CTE, Career Technical Education, and it's funded by

11:59.880 --> 12:07.480
two major streams, what they call the CTIG, the California Technical Educational Incentive Grant,

12:07.480 --> 12:15.080
which is in its seventh year of funding, and the Strong Workforce Program, SWP, that's administered

12:15.080 --> 12:22.120
by the California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office. But the update on this is when you think

12:22.120 --> 12:30.600
of CTE, it's not how we used to think of it, like body and vendor or mechanics or plumbers,

12:30.600 --> 12:39.400
although that's still a part of it. But it's so much more today about health careers, technology,

12:40.920 --> 12:47.640
business and finance, so much more of the jobs that we need for the future.

12:48.840 --> 12:59.640
So the update I have from this committee is that we have selected some metrics that we'll be

12:59.640 --> 13:08.040
measuring the effort in California in this area, and some of those are available now and being

13:08.040 --> 13:17.960
captured, such as the CTE student participation rates, you know, students that take one CTE class

13:17.960 --> 13:27.160
or two or more classes measuring that. The second metric are the graduation rates in association

13:27.160 --> 13:34.600
with CTE participation. The third are the number of people pupils meeting academic and career

13:34.600 --> 13:41.240
readiness standards, as defined in the college and career indicator associated with our school

13:41.240 --> 13:48.760
dashboard. The fourth is a newer one. It's the number of pupils obtaining an industry recognized

13:48.760 --> 13:56.120
credential, certificate, license or other measure of technical skill attainment. That's a new

13:56.840 --> 14:03.960
metric. The fifth are the number of former pupils employed and the types of businesses in which

14:03.960 --> 14:12.840
they are employed. And then the sixth metric are the number of former pupils enrolled in each of

14:12.840 --> 14:20.520
the following post-secondary educational institution, a state apprenticeship program,

14:21.480 --> 14:27.320
and a form of job training other than a state apprenticeship program. Those are new metrics,

14:27.320 --> 14:39.000
those last three. So the update on the CTIG grant awards this past year, there was $300 million

14:39.000 --> 14:47.640
available in the 21-22 year of the seventh year of ongoing funding. After the applications were

14:47.640 --> 15:00.120
scored by CTE in the first round, 342 applicants were funded of about, I think there was 370

15:00.120 --> 15:08.600
applications that came in, 342 were funded. So CTE put out a second round, a 7B round,

15:09.480 --> 15:21.320
and 31 additional applications were funded in 7B. So a total of $248,459,000 were allocated out

15:21.320 --> 15:31.880
this past year under CTIG. So going forward, the plan is the CCCCO, community colleges,

15:32.840 --> 15:39.960
have contracted with Jobs for the Future, JFF, to administer and facilitate the development and

15:39.960 --> 15:50.040
writing of the plan for California, a new CTE plan that'll pull together the CTIG and the Perkins

15:50.040 --> 15:57.320
Five federal program. The draft plan was approved at our recent committee back on August 11th this

15:57.320 --> 16:05.880
year. The next steps will be that CTE will post the draft plan for a 45-day public comment period,

16:07.320 --> 16:13.000
and then CTE will present its edited draft plan along with the statements and requests from the

16:13.000 --> 16:21.800
45-day public comment period at the November subcommittee meeting, November. The edited plan,

16:21.800 --> 16:28.360
if approved, will then be presented at our meeting in January, as well as the board of

16:28.360 --> 16:35.960
governors meeting in January for potential approval. So the California draft plan,

16:35.960 --> 16:40.440
so take a look at that during the public comment period for input and edits.

16:42.360 --> 16:47.880
And that's it on that subcommittee. One other announcement I'd like to make is that,

16:48.680 --> 16:57.400
you know, in California we have the amber alert system, and then we have the silver alert system,

16:58.120 --> 17:06.760
but recently the legislation approved what's called the feather alert program. As many of you know,

17:07.560 --> 17:12.920
tribes throughout the state of California and the nation have had a rough time with missing and

17:12.920 --> 17:20.920
murdered members as tribal members, and the 23rd of this month the governor will have an

17:20.920 --> 17:27.800
opportunity to sign that bill, the feather alert system for California, and just so happens the

17:27.800 --> 17:35.080
23rd is California Indian Day also. It's been around since Governor Ronald Reagan approved it,

17:35.640 --> 17:41.240
but an opportunity to sign that bill into law for the feather alert system.

17:42.200 --> 17:43.880
And that's all I have. Thank you.

17:46.840 --> 17:49.800
Thank you so much. Member Olken.

17:52.280 --> 18:02.200
Thank you. Thank you. I too have a somewhat brief report this month because I'm the liaison

18:02.200 --> 18:08.680
to both the advisory commission on charter schools, which we have a couple of issues on

18:08.680 --> 18:12.840
items on the agenda, and also the advisory commission on special education. So I'm going

18:12.840 --> 18:18.600
to speak to that one. I had the pleasure of attending the August meeting of the advisory

18:18.600 --> 18:24.680
commission on special education. It's really a joy to be a fly on the wall at this commission

18:24.680 --> 18:29.480
meeting. The commissioners represent an incredible cross-section of stakeholders,

18:30.040 --> 18:37.800
educators at every level, parents, policymakers, advocates. There is a clear commitment on

18:37.800 --> 18:41.560
amongst this group to collaborate on behalf of students with disabilities,

18:42.200 --> 18:47.560
and there's such clear respect for the varied expertise of the group. I may have said this

18:47.560 --> 18:54.360
before, but it feels a little bit like the way the very best IEP meetings run where you have

18:55.560 --> 19:00.920
stakeholders, all who care very much about the success of children with disabilities,

19:00.920 --> 19:06.520
and they come together and each bring something important to the table. So I love attending these

19:06.520 --> 19:15.480
meetings. The August meeting was the first meeting of the new school year, and so there was sort of

19:15.480 --> 19:22.760
a start of school feel, which was fantastic. State Superintendent Thurman joined the meeting to share

19:22.760 --> 19:29.320
some framing thoughts on the importance of the commission's work and also his hopes overall for

19:29.320 --> 19:35.800
this new school year. And over the course of the two-day meeting, we had several new commissioners

19:35.800 --> 19:45.160
were sworn in. There was a thorough and really helpful report from staff at the Legislative

19:45.160 --> 19:51.560
Analyst's Office outlining the legislative and budget process. It was sort of like how a bill

19:51.560 --> 20:00.440
becomes a law on steroids, a little schoolhouse rock moment. The commissioners reviewed last year's

20:00.440 --> 20:05.400
accomplishments in order to begin drafting their annual report, which is actually something that's

20:05.480 --> 20:12.360
presented to us at a future meeting, and they worked with folks from supporting inclusive practices

20:13.480 --> 20:18.040
on a logic model to help guide their work and actions this year. And I found that really

20:18.040 --> 20:25.000
interesting, the process of working through the logic model as they were thinking about what

20:25.000 --> 20:31.160
their initiatives are going to be, what their legislative agenda would be, and how they can help

20:32.120 --> 20:39.400
further the work in the field and also really provide education and support to those who are

20:39.400 --> 20:45.400
doing the work at the school and county and district level. So it was a great meeting.

20:45.400 --> 20:54.440
And last thing I would just say is just in terms of the new school year, it's been, I just want to

20:54.520 --> 21:00.200
echo the congratulations and good wishes that we've heard for those in schools.

21:01.800 --> 21:07.240
From my own experience, it's been really great to start a year that has a little bit less question

21:07.240 --> 21:16.280
and feels more stable. And it's just been a great start. And I think both students and educators

21:16.280 --> 21:21.560
are really ready to roll up their sleeves and get to work after a prolonged period of

21:22.520 --> 21:27.800
strangeness. So anyway, it's great to be back in the school year, and it's great to be with

21:27.800 --> 21:32.440
all of you. Thanks. Thank you. Member Roscoe Gonzalez.

21:34.760 --> 21:40.680
Let me unmute myself. Well, it's been, you know, as the classroom teacher and the board,

21:41.240 --> 21:47.240
and teaching second grade and actually have back to school night today, it's been a very,

21:47.320 --> 21:55.000
very busy last few weeks, but really good busy work. I think that from reviewing our test scores

21:55.000 --> 22:01.000
to getting into the trenches of what we did last year to doing that reflection process and seeing

22:01.000 --> 22:06.600
how we can improve our instruction has been really meaningful. And it is every year as my assignment

22:07.240 --> 22:12.120
being lays on assessment. I always say it's important for communities and families and

22:12.120 --> 22:18.040
students, educators to be able to know how the dashboard is structured and how to access

22:18.040 --> 22:23.080
data to help guide learning and target the needs of our students. When information is

22:23.080 --> 22:27.880
accessible and available for educators, we can make better informed decisions for our students

22:27.880 --> 22:33.400
and we can plan meaningful curriculum for them. In our last month's meeting, the CDE

22:33.400 --> 22:38.120
recommended, as we mentioned, an item for using shorter adjusted blueprints for the

22:38.120 --> 22:44.120
Smarter Balanced summative assessments. This, I think, is a huge benefit. I always think

22:44.120 --> 22:50.760
reduced testing time allows for more instruction, just as increases that instructional time,

22:50.760 --> 22:55.800
where I think teachers are every day developing formative and summative assessments. I know that

22:55.800 --> 23:01.880
we're doing diagnostics. I just finished two weeks ago, assessing all my students and really

23:01.880 --> 23:07.160
understanding deeply where their reading levels are and getting them ready for that, you know,

23:07.160 --> 23:12.840
now getting them ready for that third grade test because we want them to be successful as they

23:12.840 --> 23:19.560
transition to the next grade level. So I want to remind teachers that we have the tool for teachers

23:19.560 --> 23:25.960
at our CDE website. These tools for teachers have the new formative assessment component,

23:25.960 --> 23:33.080
the Smarter Balanced assessment system. It also has a huge collection of online resources that

23:33.080 --> 23:39.480
are aligned with the Common Core standards that support the K-12 teachers, and I think these

23:39.480 --> 23:44.600
formative assessments that are available have accessible strategies embedded in every instructional

23:44.600 --> 23:50.360
resource. What I like more about these tools is that they're developed by teachers and have been

23:50.360 --> 23:57.240
reviewed by a huge network of throughout the state of teachers. I know that at one point I was a

23:57.240 --> 24:02.600
reviewer for some of these items, and I know that they go through a huge process of just vetting

24:03.080 --> 24:09.720
making sure that they're aligned to grade level standards. So that concludes my presentation,

24:09.720 --> 24:14.200
and I welcome all teachers to visit that. It's the beginning of the school year, and when you have a

24:14.200 --> 24:21.400
little gap of time, which is limited, I know it's not always, please visit those tools for teachers,

24:21.400 --> 24:25.720
and I think that you'll find that they're really great resources for your classroom.

24:25.720 --> 24:32.120
Terrific. We're going to go to Member Patil Branson.

24:33.480 --> 24:41.240
Good morning. I have two items I'm going to report on. One is that we had the successful

24:41.240 --> 24:48.520
completion of the California State Summer School for the Arts session, which actually began in July

24:48.520 --> 24:56.440
and included on August. For folks who might not know, the California Summer School for the Arts

24:56.440 --> 25:05.080
is a four-week program in residence at CalArts with a host of visiting artists, special screenings,

25:05.640 --> 25:11.160
weekly showcases of student work, and it's really designed to bring together some of the more

25:11.160 --> 25:18.120
promising and dedicated young arts students from across the state in one very intensive program

25:19.080 --> 25:25.400
focuses on dance, film, music, theater, visual arts, writing, and has a growing animation program.

25:27.800 --> 25:36.120
As that concluded, the Board of Trustees, to which I'm a liaison, also held its summer strategic

25:36.120 --> 25:42.920
planning session, so immediately hardly taking a breath for having provided a jam-packed four

25:43.000 --> 25:49.560
weeks of content for the summer school program, the Board immediately launched into a discussion

25:49.560 --> 25:54.920
around what is the future of the summer school, what are the assets to leverage, how to actually

25:54.920 --> 26:02.680
connect with the many now well-established and in some circles quite famous and in pop culture

26:02.680 --> 26:10.040
circles quite well-known alumni of the program to make sure that it's something that's widely

26:10.040 --> 26:16.040
understood as a offering that's available to young artists throughout California.

26:16.840 --> 26:22.600
I think there has also been an ongoing discussion around how to ensure appropriate outreach,

26:23.560 --> 26:29.720
to ensure that the program draws across geographies, socioeconomics, language,

26:29.720 --> 26:34.920
ethnic backgrounds, in order to really represent all of California's diversity.

26:35.480 --> 26:40.680
In the last budget, there was an inclusion of increased funding for the summer school

26:40.680 --> 26:47.000
for the arts, which I think was very much well received with great gratitude by both the program

26:47.000 --> 26:53.560
and ministry, as well as the students, because much of that funding is going to go into scholarships

26:53.560 --> 27:00.840
so that this great California offering isn't one that precludes anyone as a reason of not being

27:00.840 --> 27:05.080
able to pay tuition for the summer, so really excited for the progress that's being made there

27:05.080 --> 27:12.520
and more to come. Once we have actual applications becoming available, I'll be sure to flag that

27:12.520 --> 27:19.080
in case any of you all want to share that with your networks as well. The second meeting liaison

27:19.080 --> 27:26.440
is with the Early Childhood Policy Council, which met on July 19th, and there are really three things

27:26.440 --> 27:33.400
I wanted to highlight there. One, and I think the one that is most obvious and closest in connection

27:33.400 --> 27:42.440
to our work here at the state board, was an ongoing implementation of Universal TK as part

27:43.080 --> 27:52.440
of School to Three initiatives. I think most of you all know we are rolling this out in successive

27:52.440 --> 28:00.520
years until 2026. Also, I think there was a really robust discussion around the developmental

28:00.520 --> 28:05.400
sort of practices within that, and I think obviously this last year's budget of bringing

28:05.400 --> 28:12.680
down the adult-child ratio to reflect how unique the early years are and the need for different

28:12.680 --> 28:17.800
sort of staffing ratio. I don't know if anyone's ever been in a classroom where there's 34-year-olds

28:17.800 --> 28:25.160
and one adult, but that is not ideal for a variety of reasons, and we're really excited

28:25.800 --> 28:33.080
that the state budget included funding to actually bring that adult-child ratio into a proportion

28:33.080 --> 28:39.240
that better suits child development, learning, and also a better experience for everyone.

28:40.680 --> 28:47.320
The second thing that they provided an update on was the transition of child care programs

28:47.320 --> 28:52.520
and also early learning programs for Zero to Three to the Department of Social Services.

28:54.840 --> 29:00.280
The Department of Social Services child care programs both overseas Zero to Three as well

29:00.280 --> 29:05.720
as school-age after-school care, so they are critical partners in terms of ensuring that the

29:05.720 --> 29:12.600
community wraparound supports for children, particularly from Zero to Twelve, are there to

29:12.600 --> 29:18.920
ensure that kids have a safe place to be after school, have a place to learn, to do homework,

29:18.920 --> 29:26.200
to be nurtured and cared for, and the exciting thing that is also on the horizon is that the

29:26.200 --> 29:33.800
DSS rate-setting workgroup has been meeting and is very close to finalizing recommendations

29:33.800 --> 29:39.240
around wage sufficiency and how to address teacher shortages in the earliest years.

29:40.040 --> 29:45.160
The last thing I'll mention is that there was also a presentation on family-centered

29:45.160 --> 29:53.000
two-generation approaches, particularly focusing on home visitation. In the context of the Early

29:53.000 --> 29:58.920
Childhood Policy Council, oftentimes home visiting is described as a Zero to Five innovation, but I

29:58.920 --> 30:05.160
lift it up because many school districts across California have had a history of doing home

30:05.160 --> 30:12.600
visiting with school-age children as well, and the research on the importance of creating,

30:12.600 --> 30:18.520
fostering, nurturing, developing, and maintaining those school-to-family connections I think is

30:18.520 --> 30:24.840
only growing, and just wanting to cross-pollinate between the Zero to Five space and the K to Twelve

30:24.840 --> 30:32.680
space that there are new pathways for both how to fund and cover the costs of these, some with

30:32.680 --> 30:39.320
Medicaid, which is a new funding stream to draw down to think about how, again, to wrap around

30:39.320 --> 30:43.800
the full supports for kids to make sure they're ready to learn, and that concludes my report.

30:46.280 --> 30:52.280
Terrific. There's so much being done right now. Student Member Porter, would you like to make

30:52.280 --> 30:59.720
any comments? Yes, thank you. So as you all know, this was my first month officially in office,

30:59.720 --> 31:07.080
and with that I had two main goals. So first, I wanted to increase the visibility of the student

31:07.080 --> 31:13.800
member position using student-friendly language on social media, and second, I wanted to increase

31:13.800 --> 31:19.160
the number of student applicants to serve on the state board next year and the Instructional Quality

31:19.160 --> 31:26.520
Commission student seat. So I used three main strategies to accomplish this. So first, I created

31:26.520 --> 31:33.160
a video describing each of these positions and posted it on TikTok, YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram,

31:33.720 --> 31:40.040
and using social media tracking insights, I am very happy to report that over 9,000 users have

31:40.040 --> 31:47.320
seen this video, and 6,900 of those views came from Instagram, and the numbers just continue to

31:47.320 --> 31:54.440
climb. Second, in collaboration with Los Angeles Unified School District Student Empowerment

31:54.440 --> 32:01.880
Commission, I met with 50 students to host a town hall answering questions about these two

32:01.880 --> 32:07.080
opportunities and encouraging younger students to begin thinking about ways to get involved

32:07.080 --> 32:15.320
in their own schools. During the summer, I spoke at Ed100 Student Academy, speaking to over 250

32:15.320 --> 32:21.240
young leaders throughout our state about these two opportunities as well. Lastly, I collaborated

32:21.240 --> 32:28.440
with Generation Up and the California Association of Student Councils to co-create a social media

32:28.440 --> 32:34.120
post explaining these positions to their audience of young leaders using student-friendly language

32:34.120 --> 32:42.040
and graphics. So now I'm working closely with the leadership team at CASC to prepare for the Student

32:42.040 --> 32:48.200
Advisory Board on Education's conference in October and November, so that way our students can be

32:48.200 --> 32:54.440
represented at our November meeting and brainstorm and craft their recommendations to be presented

32:54.440 --> 33:01.160
to this board. And that concludes my report. Thank you. Terrific. That's the first state

33:01.160 --> 33:07.160
board member report that I've heard about a board member posting on TikTok, so I don't appreciate

33:09.000 --> 33:13.160
the fact that you're reaching the audience in a new way. Meet them where they're at, right?

33:13.160 --> 33:20.280
Right. Member Rodriguez. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And yes, TikTok is the way to go.

33:22.040 --> 33:32.440
So I will report on CTC. Member McQuillan reported on our QAP Jack, which I learned was the acronym

33:32.440 --> 33:40.520
for the Workforce Preparation Group. And so I'll devote my time to CTC, which is actually a pretty

33:40.520 --> 33:48.680
long report. First of all, I am so pleased to share the wonderful news that the National Board

33:48.680 --> 33:55.000
for Professional Teaching Standards Board of Directors voted to present the James A. Kelly Award

33:55.800 --> 34:01.960
for accomplished teaching to Dr. Mary Vixi Sandy, who is the executive director of the CTC.

34:03.400 --> 34:10.120
A little bit about the award. It was established in honor of James Kelly, the founding president

34:10.120 --> 34:16.600
of NBPTS. And it is given to recognize and honor individuals who provide clear,

34:17.880 --> 34:22.760
consistent, and convincing evidence of their ability to foster Mr. Kelly's legacy of

34:22.760 --> 34:29.320
accomplished teaching, which includes a deep-seated belief in the inherent right of all children to

34:29.320 --> 34:36.040
a quality education, life dedicated to improving education for teachers and students, passionate

34:36.040 --> 34:42.760
commitment to improving teaching and learning in America, unwavering dedication to the professional

34:42.760 --> 34:50.760
integrity and competence of teachers, vision, capacity to inspire collaboration. And

34:52.120 --> 34:59.160
among us, we have a recipient of this award, President Linda Darling-Hammond,

34:59.640 --> 35:09.080
and others who have been awarded from California, Dr. Mike Hurst, and among other recipients or

35:09.080 --> 35:18.120
governors and former presidents. So it is very exciting and very deserving. Dr. Sandy does

35:19.160 --> 35:25.000
a tremendous work bringing together community partners and her vision for

35:25.880 --> 35:34.280
our children in California and for the teaching profession is evident in every word that she

35:34.280 --> 35:42.920
speaks. So please join me in congratulating her. Also tomorrow, I will be speaking at the Meredith

35:42.920 --> 35:50.360
Fellows implementation conference on performance assessment. I think I was asked because I said

35:51.320 --> 35:56.440
I wanted to make a t-shirt that says all life is a performance assessment because

35:58.040 --> 36:04.840
you know, it's what we do, it's how we demonstrate what we know, right, and bring

36:06.440 --> 36:13.400
information that we learn in teacher preparation school, bring it together in front of our students,

36:14.360 --> 36:21.960
and have our students also demonstrate what they know to us with their performance tasks. So I'm

36:21.960 --> 36:30.760
excited to represent teachers in this capacity as a national board certified teacher. I know that

36:31.880 --> 36:38.680
teaching and learning can be messy, right? It's definitely not a filtered picture. And so I hope

36:38.840 --> 36:46.120
to share some of how a reflective practitioner serves our students in a way that

36:48.040 --> 36:58.760
we set valuable goals for them and take them through that helix to make sure that they

36:58.760 --> 37:05.240
meet those goals and we guide them along the way. So I've said this before, I wouldn't want

37:05.880 --> 37:10.760
an airplane pilot to not demonstrate what they know before they get behind an airplane that I'll

37:10.760 --> 37:19.800
be flying in, or a surgeon not being able to demonstrate to other professionals that they

37:19.800 --> 37:24.360
know what they're doing, just like I wouldn't want a teacher in front of my students who hasn't

37:24.360 --> 37:31.160
demonstrated to a body that has set the standards for teaching that they know what they're doing.

37:31.720 --> 37:35.960
So I'm very excited about presenting tomorrow at the conference.

37:37.960 --> 37:45.080
So some of the updates of the CTC meeting that happened in August, the commission's literacy

37:45.080 --> 37:52.840
work group undertook a review of the commission's adopted educator preparation program standards

37:53.880 --> 37:59.080
related to the literacy teacher performance expectations and submitted recommendations for

37:59.080 --> 38:07.480
consideration by the CTC in accordance with SB 48. SB 48 was talked about in the June meeting,

38:07.480 --> 38:13.080
but hopefully I'll give you enough information with this report if you're not familiar with the

38:14.040 --> 38:22.760
Senate bill. So the initial focus of the work group has been giving the updates on

38:22.760 --> 38:27.720
the program standards. The literacy work group will have a final meeting because there are

38:27.720 --> 38:36.440
deadlines to SB 488 on September 13th to review the data from the field and surveys as well as

38:36.440 --> 38:42.680
feedback and direction from commissioners before recommending any final revisions that they think

38:42.680 --> 38:50.440
are necessary and appropriate. And staff will present the full set of the literacy program

38:50.440 --> 38:56.760
standards and teacher performance expectations to the commission for adoption in October

38:57.400 --> 39:06.360
2020 or coming up next month. The product that will result from the requirements of SB 48 is to

39:06.360 --> 39:14.040
develop universal program standards and teacher performance expectations, TPEs, that will not only

39:14.040 --> 39:21.960
provide high standards and programs for traditional K-12 community, but to also meet the very unique

39:21.960 --> 39:29.480
developmental learning needs of PK3 students and all students with dyslexia. Establishing

39:29.480 --> 39:35.720
standards for PK3 and dyslexia needs that are a cookie cutter of grade one will not work.

39:35.720 --> 39:41.160
Literacy standards need to reflect the reality of the developmental stages of all early learners.

39:43.000 --> 39:49.080
For the CAL APA, which is the Administrator Performance Assessment, so we're moving on here,

39:49.720 --> 39:58.200
the CTC heard an update on the first four years of implementation, and it's very favorable. People

39:58.200 --> 40:10.920
are showing that they're very pleased with the process, and they were informed about

40:10.920 --> 40:17.240
leadership cycle one, which is analyzing data to inform school improvement and promote equity.

40:17.960 --> 40:24.040
Cycle two, facilitating communities of practice, and cycle three, supporting teacher growth.

40:26.360 --> 40:34.920
So in June, a couple of meetings ago, the commission endorsed the proposed authorization statement

40:34.920 --> 40:38.520
and credential requirements for the early childhood education specialist.

40:39.240 --> 40:43.320
The CTC reviewed and adopted the proposed regulations

40:43.960 --> 40:52.040
for newly repurposed PK3 EC specialist instruction credential, and so that's very,

40:52.040 --> 40:59.160
very exciting. The requirements for PK3 include possession of a bachelor's or higher degree

40:59.160 --> 41:05.000
from a regionally accredited institution, completion of a professional preparation program

41:05.000 --> 41:12.440
that meets PK EC program standards, passage of a commission approved teaching performance

41:12.440 --> 41:19.160
assessment, and passage of either the RECA or a commission approved literacy performance assessment.

41:24.200 --> 41:30.440
I'm going to go to some very exciting news that makes me tremendously grateful

41:30.520 --> 41:38.920
to live in California as an educator. And that is the enacted 2022-23 budget

41:39.800 --> 41:50.840
as it relates to the commission. The budget provides $330.5 million for a total of 29 new positions

41:51.480 --> 41:58.440
for the agency and fee waivers. $24 million one-time general fund

41:59.080 --> 42:06.760
to waive feature examination and assessment fees. And these examinations include the CBEST,

42:07.480 --> 42:17.560
CSET, RECA, TPA, and TPA and APA. So now I won't go into detail if you want the details

42:17.560 --> 42:24.120
on the specific positions that will be opening at the CTC. I'm happy to email those to you,

42:24.760 --> 42:30.440
but they are long. But in there, they include reading and literacy grants,

42:31.960 --> 42:40.440
accreditation, Center for Teaching Careers, $1.7 million, a one-time general fund to support

42:40.440 --> 42:46.200
Tulare County Office of Education to continue administering the California Center on Teaching

42:46.200 --> 42:50.040
Careers. So that concludes my report.

42:56.200 --> 43:01.480
You've gotten off. Thank you so much. Member Yoshimoto-Tari, would you like to make some

43:01.480 --> 43:07.640
remarks? Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to offer my personal reflections. This being

43:07.640 --> 43:13.960
my first state board meeting. And yesterday's experience has reaffirmed for me the impact of

43:13.960 --> 43:19.000
the decisions that the State Board of Education makes, particularly given the diverse student

43:19.000 --> 43:24.200
population that we serve, but also the diversity of county offices, districts, schools, and

43:24.200 --> 43:31.320
communities that we serve. So it kind of had three reflections at this point, which one was

43:31.320 --> 43:36.040
the importance of the systems of gathering meaningful feedback and engagement. So I'm

43:36.040 --> 43:41.240
happy to hear all of my colleagues liaison reports and relationships because that's so important.

43:41.880 --> 43:46.280
Secondly, that I really highlight the state's efforts to do the outreach that we talked about

43:46.280 --> 43:51.560
yesterday, the communication, the webinars, the different toolkits, such as the one that was

43:51.560 --> 43:58.280
released last month. And then finally, third is just what board member Porter reinforced this

43:58.280 --> 44:03.480
morning, which is that young people are a source of inspiration and opportunity for us to continue

44:03.480 --> 44:09.480
to learn and innovate. So as many of my colleagues have shared, just let's make this a wonderful

44:09.560 --> 44:16.840
school year. Campus and school is often a place where students experience joy, wellness, in

44:16.840 --> 44:22.600
addition to the teaching and learning that happens, and a place where real innovation can happen. So

44:22.600 --> 44:28.600
thank you again. Terrific. Thank you. And I'll just say briefly, so much of the work that we've

44:28.600 --> 44:33.320
all been doing has had to do with implementation of all of these major initiatives over the last

44:33.320 --> 44:41.240
couple of years. And member Petillo Bronson brought us up to date on the UPK, the universal

44:41.240 --> 44:48.920
TK and other early childhood work. There is a lot of work going on in the teacher pathways. And

44:49.560 --> 44:56.200
so I've intersected with some of that around the launch of program design conversations at

44:56.200 --> 45:01.560
the California State University system. I addressed one group of their early childhood

45:02.520 --> 45:10.840
providers. And across the state, we're trying to really get people to think about the challenges

45:10.840 --> 45:19.560
of the new ECE credential and the many, many ways that we will build that educated workforce. And

45:19.560 --> 45:27.800
a lot is happening to be pleased about, and a lot of it happening with great alacrity and speed.

45:28.600 --> 45:35.720
Member Escobedo talked about the fact that there's a lot of staffing challenge around the country.

45:35.720 --> 45:43.400
Of course, we put in place multi-billions of dollars for residencies and Golden State

45:44.520 --> 45:50.760
scholarships and career pathways for paraprofessionals and many other ways to

45:50.760 --> 45:56.440
address our shortages. We are beginning to see some changes. We've got an uptick in enrollments

45:56.440 --> 46:03.560
in teacher education that is noticeable. And there are, from a recent analysis of the CTC

46:03.560 --> 46:10.920
surveys, about 1,400 people who were involved in residencies last year, candidates who came

46:10.920 --> 46:16.280
through residency programs. They were the most positive about their preparation experiences

46:16.920 --> 46:27.000
of the various categories of entrance into the profession. 70 plus residencies now exist across

46:27.000 --> 46:33.800
the state. And that is beginning to spread across the country. Texas has just put about a billion

46:33.800 --> 46:41.240
dollars into residencies in that state as well. So we are seeing that grow. And there's a lot of,

46:41.240 --> 46:46.120
with all these programs, there's a lot of growing pains and implementation concerns.

46:46.120 --> 46:53.480
And we're trying to stay on top of that particular props to our state board staff member,

46:53.480 --> 46:59.800
Rigel Massara, who keeps track of all of that and is really enabling a lot of smoothing of the way

46:59.800 --> 47:10.760
for many of these programs. We've also just gotten going on centers that were funded in the prior

47:10.840 --> 47:19.000
budget for accelerated learning, for helping support professional development, for people

47:19.000 --> 47:23.880
who may be involved in classroom teaching and tutoring and small group instruction

47:24.680 --> 47:32.120
to support really enabling students to move more rapidly in their skill development.

47:33.080 --> 47:38.360
Some would say to catch up from the learning lag that has experienced. So we now have

47:38.360 --> 47:42.520
several centers across the state that are now beginning to do that work.

47:44.440 --> 47:53.240
The new IEP template and other innovations that were part of the budget previously is

47:53.240 --> 48:00.440
continuing to be developed. There's a team that is working on that for our special education students

48:00.440 --> 48:06.840
and also on the development of a pathway to a diploma for students who previously were not

48:06.840 --> 48:14.520
able to do that. So that's very exciting progress in that arena. You all know about the fact that

48:14.520 --> 48:21.400
the community schools initiatives are continuing to roll out and there will be several opportunities

48:21.400 --> 48:30.760
to hear about the gains and the strategies that different districts are taking. And the

48:30.760 --> 48:36.760
Department of Education is about to do a set of webinars that will bring people in and let them

48:36.760 --> 48:41.480
learn from each other. So you may want to keep an eye out for that if that's an area that you're

48:41.480 --> 48:47.720
working with. And finally the school year is starting as many people have said with a sense of

48:48.760 --> 48:59.240
normalcy and a sense of going direct and being able to be back fully. At the same time we do

48:59.240 --> 49:06.600
continue to have concerns about the variants of COVID-19 and about the virus. So

49:08.120 --> 49:14.680
this afternoon I'll partner with our friends at the California Department of Public Health

49:15.640 --> 49:23.960
in a sort of public service hour about what districts can expect and ways in which they can

49:24.840 --> 49:30.200
keep students safe, engage in mitigation strategies. We'll hear from several districts

49:30.200 --> 49:37.800
that are doing very thoughtful work on everything from vaccinations to testing to

49:39.240 --> 49:44.760
their whole range of mitigation strategies that we want to keep people alert to so that we can

49:44.760 --> 49:53.320
in fact stay in business, keep kids in school and be healthy this year. So with that I will move us

49:53.400 --> 50:00.280
to our agenda for the day and we are going to take up the waiver consent calendar.

50:01.320 --> 50:09.480
And we're going to take up waiver consent items 1 through 9, W1 through W9. We're going to open

50:09.480 --> 50:13.800
the phone line for public comments so let's get the public comment slide up there.

50:17.160 --> 50:23.160
We're going to take a moment to allow people to queue up and call in if they care to do so

50:23.880 --> 50:28.200
this is our moment for mindfulness. Take a breath.

50:33.960 --> 50:39.640
While everyone's taking their mindfulness break we would just like to remind the public that this

50:39.640 --> 50:44.120
is public comment for the waivers as President Darlene Hammond just remind everyone for waivers

50:44.760 --> 50:51.720
W1 through W9. If you're seeking to call in on the subsequent item, item 11 regarding

50:51.720 --> 50:57.400
the charter appeal please call back at that time. We see that there are a number of callers that

50:58.040 --> 51:01.160
based on the area code we think may be calling in for that item. We would just like to remind

51:01.160 --> 51:07.960
them that this is not the moment for that. Thank you that's very helpful. So if you are

51:07.960 --> 51:16.040
calling for the next item on the charter appeal hang up now and call back.

51:16.760 --> 51:22.360
And with that let me ask is there any is there any public comment on the waiver items?

51:27.240 --> 51:33.400
Is anybody still on the phone? We see some callers dropping but it appears we may have two.

51:34.360 --> 51:41.640
Okay. Okay I will open the phone line now. Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

51:41.640 --> 51:45.000
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

51:51.880 --> 51:58.920
Hello. Okay it looks like they hung up. We have one caller left. I will answer that one and we'll

51:58.920 --> 52:04.840
see if it's for this item. Caller please state your name and affiliation for the record. You

52:04.840 --> 52:14.040
have one minute. Your time starts now. Caller ending in the last four digits two zero two two

52:14.040 --> 52:24.440
you are live. Please start your public comment now. Okay it looks like that they were all for

52:24.440 --> 52:32.200
the next item. That concludes public comment for the waiver consent items. All right given that

52:32.200 --> 52:38.760
there's no other public comment I'll now ask for a motion on waivers W-1 through W-9. Do I have a

52:38.760 --> 52:47.960
motion? So moved. Thank you. Do I have a second? Second. Thank you. We'll now hold a roll call

52:47.960 --> 52:56.680

Member Rodriguez. Yes. Member Yoshimoto-Towry. Yes. Motion passes unanimously.

53:28.040 --> 53:34.680
All right we're moving on to item number 11 which is the appeal of the denial of a petition for

53:34.680 --> 53:39.400
the establishment of a classroom-based charter pursuant to California Education Code section

53:39.400 --> 53:47.560
47605K2. It's consideration of evidence to hear or summarily deny the appeal of

53:47.560 --> 53:52.760
Mayacamas Charter Middle School which was denied by the Napa Valley Unified School District and

53:52.760 --> 53:57.480
the Napa County Board of Education. The California Department of Education recommends that we hear

53:57.480 --> 54:05.160
the appeal and this item will be presented by Stephanie Farland of the CDE. Stephanie. Good

54:05.160 --> 54:12.840
morning. Good morning President Darling-Hammond, board members, deputy superintendent Sarah Neville

54:12.840 --> 54:19.960
Morgan. It's good to be here today. Before I begin I just want to recognize that today kicks

54:19.960 --> 54:26.120
off National Hispanic Heritage Month and as the daughter of Mexican immigrants I just want to

54:26.120 --> 54:37.160
recognize the contributions of all of Latino and Hispanic and Latinx Americans in this country and

54:37.160 --> 54:43.000
specifically those of my parents who I'm very proud of and have contributed much to California

54:43.000 --> 54:47.640
and to this country so I just wanted to recognize that it does start today.

54:49.000 --> 54:56.360
This morning as President Darling-Hammond mentioned this item will be to decide to hear or

54:57.080 --> 55:01.240
to make a decision to hear or summarily deny the appeal of Mayacamas Charter Middle School.

55:01.240 --> 55:05.800
A little background the Mayacamas Charter Middle School petition proposes a new grade six through

55:05.800 --> 55:13.160
eight charter school. MCMS as we will call it submitted its petition to the Napa Valley Unified

55:13.160 --> 55:21.560
School District pursuant to California and code section 47605A. The district denied the petition

55:21.560 --> 55:29.160
on December 9th, 2021 by a vote of seven to zero. MCMS then appealed the petition to the

55:30.120 --> 55:37.080
the MVUSD's denial to the Napa County Board of Education pursuant to code section 47605K1AI.

55:39.720 --> 55:44.600
The county denied the petition on March 15th, 2022 by a vote of five to two.

55:45.800 --> 55:51.080
MCMS then submitted its petition to the California State Board of Education on April 14th,

55:51.080 --> 55:55.640
2022 pursuant to Ed code section 47605K2.

55:59.400 --> 56:06.920
In this item pursuant to Ed code section 47605K2E the SBA shall decide to either hear the appeal or

56:06.920 --> 56:13.800
summarily deny a review of the appeal based on the documentary record. If the SBE decides to

56:13.800 --> 56:18.920
hear the appeal the matter will be considered in the following item. If the SBE decides to

56:18.920 --> 56:23.480
summarily deny the appeal the decisions of the District and County Board of Education will stand

56:23.480 --> 56:28.200
and there will be no further determination or sorry no further hearings on this item.

56:29.160 --> 56:40.920
Our recommendation the CDE's recommendation today is that the State Board of Ed vote to hear the

56:40.920 --> 56:47.880
Maya Commons Charter School appeal. At its August 11th, 2022 meeting the Advisory Commission on

56:47.880 --> 56:53.800
Charter Schools voted to adopt the CDE's recommendation that the SBE hear the MCMS appeal

56:53.800 --> 56:57.000
and that motion passed by a vote of seven to one.

57:01.960 --> 57:08.280
MCMS has met all appeal timelines and submitted a record of the findings from NVUSD and NCBOE

57:08.280 --> 57:12.600
and a written submission with citations to the documentary record pursuant to Ed code section

57:12.600 --> 57:20.840
47605K2A. MCMS appeals both the District and the County's decisions to deny its petition.

57:21.480 --> 57:28.200
NVUSD and NCBOE also provided written oppositions with specific citations to the documentary record

57:28.200 --> 57:34.520
pursuant to Ed code section 47605K2C. These documents demonstrate that there is a factual

57:34.520 --> 57:39.480
dispute concerning the procedural history of NCBOE's denial of MCMS's petition.

57:43.400 --> 57:48.200
Based on the CDE's review of all documents and in alignment with the ACCS's recommendation the

57:48.280 --> 57:54.440
CDE recommends that the SBE hear the MCMS appeal and that concludes our presentation.

58:00.760 --> 58:05.800
At this point we will now open the phone line for public comments so we want to put the public

58:05.800 --> 58:12.360

Good morning members of the state board my name is Kathy Mancini and I'm calling on behalf of

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:16.280
the California School Employees Association urging the board to summarily deny this appeal

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:23.240
just because there is a dispute of just because the petitioners disagree with the facts in this

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:29.480
case does not mean that an abusive discretion occurred and we would strongly encourage the

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:34.280
board to summarily deny thank you. Thank you next caller please state your name

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:37.080

Hi thank you so much for the honor to speak to the board today I am Hannah Henry calling from

Napa California. I ask the board to deny this appeal we have spent enough time and resources

01:01:54.200 --> 01:02:01.080
the entire district and the county have spent already enough time on this

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:10.920
charter petition which is essentially an effort for the privileged few and we have much work to do

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:17.000
and much work has been done already to address the needs of middle schoolers. I have a fifth grader

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:22.200
going into sixth grade and I have three older children who have all gone through Napa public

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:32.680

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:38.200

Good morning President Berlingham and Vice President Glover Woods and esteemed board members

this is Gina Plait on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association.

Hi my name is Alicia Cronbach I'm a parent of a middle school child I live here in Napa County

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:26.840
and my son was born and raised in Napa County. Students are kaleidoscope of strength and needs

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:32.520
in the public schools should reflect that MCMS is a viable fiscally responsible and diverse choice

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:37.960
for a community that has consistently lost choices in the last five years. I respectfully ask that the

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:45.240
SBE hear the MCM appeal and make a decision based on that thank you. Thank you next caller

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:48.760
please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time starts now.

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:56.760
Hi my name is Marisa Pless and my daughter attends Pueblo Vista Elementary School

01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:04.040
and we are so grateful to be part of the public school system in Napa but we ask that you deny

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:10.520
the myocomis charter petition the students would be negatively impacted in the current schools and

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:16.440
resources should stay where they're at and improve the systems that are already in place.

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:25.480
Thank you so much for hearing me and for your time thank you. Thank you next caller please

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:38.280
Hi good morning thank you so much my name is Sylvia Regalado-Zaklott I am a parent of the Napa

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:43.720
Valley Unified School District we have three children that have gone pre-k through currently

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:51.960
in high school now and I want the state and the board to adamantly oppose deny hearing this any

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:58.120
further. You have put the due diligence on your local governments, county, school districts to

01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:04.680
make decisions they have painfully gone through all of the appeals process with this charter and

01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:11.000
have found that the best interest of over 16,000 students in Napa Valley benefit from having a

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:16.280
collective school district where many changes have been made and many students are currently

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:22.120
thriving and those options are still available to them and we welcome them to come into our schools

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:28.520
and be a part of a great community that is flourishing please deny this appeal and continue

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:33.000
to invest in students by not wasting tax dollars thank you. Thank you.

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:43.080
Hi I just wanted to jump in real quickly to remind our public callers that these calls are

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:47.800
really solely about the decision about whether or not to hear the appeal if you're calling in about

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:54.600
item 12 which will occur if the board votes to hear the appeal about whether it's to affirm or

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:59.080
to reverse please call in for item 12 if you're calling in to comment on whether it should be

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:07.480
heard or not please proceed thank you. Next caller please state your name and affiliation

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:09.960
for the record you have one minute your time starts now.

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:14.840
Hi my name is Marie Dennett I speak as a community member a mother and a trauma-informed

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:21.560
health care provider to advocate for this appeal. NBUSD has and continues to create harm in the

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:26.680
community by working so persistently to block myacomis from opening a smaller unique mentally

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:31.960
health-focused creative and diversified learning environment myacomis desires to provide is not

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:36.840
only desired but desperately needed in our community. NBUSD has made it abundantly clear

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:41.320
community. NBUSD has made it abundantly clear that they have no interest in listening to our

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:46.200
community beyond the example they set by spreading vicious rumors about myacomis throughout this

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:51.080
process and working incessantly to stop myacomis for an opening they have also recently closed a

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:55.400
valued and cherished 20-year program for preschool age children with special needs and have for

01:06:55.400 --> 01:07:00.440
financial reasons absorbed the children into their own district despite being doing any of the

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:05.000
ethical preparation needed to make a transition like this they didn't listen to the parents of

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.520
the children children who that program served either and the meetings I've attended NBUSD has

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:14.120
blatantly stated that they don't care if they didn't have the support to do it because they

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:19.160
have the right legally this says a lot about the way it works it is not for the benefit.

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:23.560
Thank you. Next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:32.120
your time starts now. My name is Wendy Beltrani retired NBUSD staff member and I'm speaking today

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:37.400
in support of myacomis charter in the course of the charter application process myacomis was

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:42.520
demonized by NBUSD characterized as something that would take resources from our spanish speaking

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:48.200
families in addition NAFA families were told that it was necessary to close two beloved middle schools

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:53.640
to avoid program cuts and financial ruin and yet now we're hearing the same dire predictions and

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:59.560
are being asked to support a 200 million dollar bond measure further exacerbating the lack of

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:04.360
trust families are feeling with the school district. Napa Valley Unified's habit of telling

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:09.160
Napa families what they want and need instead of asking them has set us on a path to middle school

01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:15.800
mediocrity one size does not fit all myacomis will fill a need that is sorely lacking in our

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:21.080
current middle school offerings there are kids who will not thrive in the big box schools our

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:25.960
community needs a public charter option please consider hearing the appeal for the myacomis

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:31.560
charter thank you thank you next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:38.440
you have one minute your time starts now our city needs a public charter option please consider

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:46.120
caller ending in the last four digits 3304 you are live please start your public comment now

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:57.480
uh hello this is Claire Crawford within the public interest and I urge the board to summarily deny

01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:02.440
this appeal the fact of the matter is that the district and the county both appropriately

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:11.160
evaluated this petition as having a negative fiscal and community impact on NBUSD and nothing

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:14.840
in the record indicates that there was any prejudice against the petitioners

01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:20.360
in coming to this conclusion it's very clear that this is a tough decision that the district was

01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:26.360
required to take to ensure the fiscal stability of the entire district and both the district and

01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:32.120
the county took appropriate steps navigating this brand new law that was intended to allow

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:38.760
districts to make these kinds of tough decisions without the state reversing them so I urge you to

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:44.120
summarily deny this petition thank you next caller please state your name and affiliation

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:47.160
for the record your you have one minute your time starts now

01:09:51.000 --> 01:10:00.360
good morning my name is Dr. Veigles CSCA chapter president NAPA 184 so not only does it affect the

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:08.760
students but you guys got to also consider the 600 plus that are going to get affected by

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:19.160
approving this charter I'm in favor of denial I just want to thank everybody for participating

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:24.760
and I hope everybody has a great day thank you thank you next caller please state your

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:27.800
name and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time starts now

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:38.520
hi my name is Jackie Clayton I am the first vice president CSCA NAPA chapter 184 I am also

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:47.000
employed in NAPA Valley Unified I just want to go and say my my part of the investigation

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:53.720
the evaluation the appropriate processes will follow the NAPA Valley Unified and their conclusion

01:10:54.360 --> 01:11:04.840
it is non-biased it is 100 accurate and I ask that denial be the decision we care about our

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:14.120
students and these are our students we want you to deny the charter thank you thank you

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.760
next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time starts

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:27.240
now my name is Kim Smith and I'm a parent in Napa Valley Unified I have two kids who've

01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:33.240
been through the system and are in it now I'd like the state to agree to review this appeal

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:39.080
because the way the district has tried to balance their own internal financial needs versus truly

01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:44.280
assessing what is best for the community has been mishandled very badly and I think the state needs

01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:48.920
to weigh in and recognize fiscal management does matter but community engagement community

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:53.720
involvement what communities want matters as well and when a group of parents decides they

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:57.560
need something very different from what the district is capable of offering like Maya Camas

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:03.160
and a small system we need to give them a chance it took the district 15 years to learn from the

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:09.480
river system river charter school and they are not adopting any of the practices Maya Camas is

01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:15.240
asking us to consider asking you to consider so I'd like you to approve this because the

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:20.920
district made a mistake in assessing community impact as only considering their own employment

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:25.240
roles and not the wide effect on the rest of the district and parents and students

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:31.720
thank you thank you next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:33.000

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:43.720
caller ending in the last four digits eight four nine six you are live please start your public

01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:51.800
comment now I'm calling in support of Maya Camas middle school as we all know middle school can be

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:58.840
a challenging time creating meaningful options is key to successful transition for many kids

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:06.760
NVUSD had this unique option one that the community embraced and students thrived in the

01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:12.120
abrupt removal of this program the highest performing middle school in our district was

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:19.000
strangely justified by NVUSD they are telling us the things that we need rather than listening

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:25.080
to what students need and dividing the community in the process this is why people are leaving

01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:31.160
the school district the data does not support this change and Maya Camas is the unique solution

01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:37.160
that will allow students to grow and thrive in a challenging and supportive environment

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:43.480
please consider reversing the school district's choice and support Maya Camas charter school

01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:49.240
thank you so much for all of your work thank you thank you next caller please state your name

01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:52.120

01:13:55.640 --> 01:14:08.120
hello my name is Maria Beltran I am a parent of the NVUSD school district I want to ask that you

01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:21.160
appeal the for the Maya Camas we have schools have closed in the district because of the enrollment

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:25.960
closing the district because of the enrollment being low and opening up a new school just does

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:31.880
not seem feasible at this time with schools being closed and middle schools being merged together

01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:39.160
so I please let you deny this appeal thank you thank you next caller please state your

01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:42.280
name and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time starts now

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:54.840
hi my name is Linda Inlay I was the former head of school of River School there is a desperate need

01:14:54.840 --> 01:15:00.440
for student well-being today the large middle schools in Napa do not fulfill the needs of all

01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:06.760
students the introverts the kids who don't quite fit in who are extremely sensitive or experience

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:12.360
trauma they're good SEL programs who work in some schools and not in a lot of others the

01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:17.960
difference is the health of the culture as Peter Drucker said culture needs strategies for breakfast

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:24.040
Maya Camas unique response to thriving is a 50-year-old school culture approach where the

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:30.280
hidden curriculum of culture fulfills students need for belonging for economy for caring adults

01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:36.360
model the qualities desired in students an authentic way of being versus a curriculum you

01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:42.920
teach now more than ever all students need this type of program not being offered at other Napa

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:49.800
schools please allow this appeal to be heard thank you next caller please state your name

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:03.720

here and we support the staff recommendation to hear it thank you thank you next caller

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:12.440

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:29.160
comment now thank you okay thank you I'm a mother of two middle schoolers in Napa Valley

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:34.680
Unified School District and I'm calling in support of the charter appeal for my comments

01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:39.560
because despite public data regarding student population projections through the next 20

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:44.360
years showing the lowest rates of variability or loss of students at the middle school level in Napa

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:49.880
the district has closed two sorely needed middle schools under very duplicitous means and motives

01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:55.560
and leaving us with only two horribly overcrowded low scoring middle schools where fights are normal

01:16:55.560 --> 01:17:01.000
every day and or we have one ESL dual language academy which actually does not meet the needs

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:06.120
of the entire student community it's also recently removed an entire half an hour of

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:11.560
learning instruction per day and shortened student lunch times to only 15 minutes our

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:16.120
district does not foster a positive environment for the intellectual advancement of our collective

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:21.000
student population and it only hinders it and will continue to and for the record my

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.560
comments is not a private school funded with public school dollars it's actually a public school

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:33.480
with higher academic standards thank you all of Napa students thank you next caller please

good morning my name is grace and I'm a recent alumni of NBUSD school district I fully support

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:48.360
the board's hearing of my economist charter middle school appeal investing in a variety

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:52.840
of choices for students as well as providing social emotional learning opportunities is

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:58.360
essential to many student successes and ability to thrive within public education my successes

01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:03.560
as an NBUSD alumni and now college alumni can be largely attributed to the experiences I had within

01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:08.040
river middle school as a public charter option within the time I think the current state of

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:12.200
our community and larger society has attested that giving people choice and autonomy within

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:17.160
their decisions is essential I urge the board to put children and their educational experiences

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:22.120
at the center of this choice thank you so much for your time thank you that concludes public

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:31.480
comment for item number 11 thank you thank you very much I appreciate all the public callers will

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:37.080
first ask our liaisons Vice President Glover Woods and member Olken if they have any

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:43.560
initial comments before we get into our discussion Vice President Glover Woods

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:51.240
I think actually I'm going to lead us off on this one oh okay if you have an arrangement go for it

01:18:51.240 --> 01:19:01.720
yeah thank you um I um both member Glover Woods and I attended the ACCS meeting where this item

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:11.000
was brought um and um it was clear from the testimony that there is a dispute um as has

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:17.480
been recommended that should be considered by the state board as been recommended by both CDC CDE

01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:25.320
and the ACCS um and I want to remind us um that as we have heard on this item we're only deciding

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:31.480
whether there is sufficient evidence for us to hear the appeal um we are not making any

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:35.480
that that's the only role that we have at this point thank you

01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:44.760
Vice President Glover Woods did you want to add anything yes uh President Darlingham and I I

01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:51.640
definitely would and my addition is really more of a reiteration that uh what we are deciding at this

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:58.520
time is to decide to either hear the charter denial appeal or summarily deny the appeal

01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:03.960
because we don't feel there are any grounds to actually hear the appeal and I do want to share

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:09.480
with my fellow board members that based on the information that we've received in the documentary

record and the discussion of this appeal that member Olken and I had opportunity to hear at

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:21.960

01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:37.320
appeal of the denial of a petition for the establishment of a classroom-based charter

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:46.680
school pursuant to California education code section 47605 k2 consideration of the allegations

01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:52.040
of abuse of discretion made by maya commis charter middle school which was denied by the nappa valley

01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:58.200
unified school district and the nappa county board of education and this item the california

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:03.480
department of education recommends that we affirm the decisions to deny the petition

01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:11.720
the item will be presented by Stephanie Farland of the CDE and Stephanie you may begin great thank

01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:17.960
you um in the previous item the state board of ed decided to hear the appeal based on the documentary

01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:25.080
record so this is what we'll be doing today um item number 12 some background in this item the

01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:29.560
california state board of education will hear the maya commis charter middle school appeal

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:38.520
pursuant to california education code 47605 k2e the sbe may affirm the determination of the

01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:43.080
governing board of the school district or the county board of education or both of those

01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:50.200
determinations or the sbe may reverse only upon a determination that there was an abuse of discretion

01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:56.120
if the sbe does not take action to affirm or reverse the determinations of the governing

01:24:56.120 --> 01:25:01.640
board of the school district and the county board of education to deny the mcms petition would stand

01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:09.160
the california department of education recommends that the sbe

01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:14.760
affirm the nappa valley unified school districts and the nappa county board of education's decisions

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:21.720
to deny the petition to establish mcms pursuant to ed code section 47605 k2e

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:27.880
this recommendation is based on the cde's review of the following mcms's written submission which

01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:34.520
fails to show an abuse of discretion by either nbusd or ncboe the documentary record and written

01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:36.280
oppositions by the district and county

01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:48.120
abuse of discretion um we we did go over this at the july meeting but but i know we have a new

01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:55.080
member today and so a couple new members um so to uh review abuse of discretion is the most

01:25:55.080 --> 01:26:00.120
deferential standard of review the sbe is required to give deference to the decision of the school

01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:05.240
district governing board and county board of education to deny the petition the sbe's review

01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:09.800
is limited to limited to a determination of whether the district governing board

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:15.480
or county board's decision to deny the charter petition was arbitrary capricious

01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:20.600
and tarot entirely lacking in evidentiary support unlawful or procedurally unfair

01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:29.400
so now we'll go over the maya commas charter middle school's allegations of abuse of discretion

01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:36.680
mcms stated the following allegations of abuse of discretion by the nbusd and these will be the

01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:41.160
allegations against the district the factual findings adopted by the district board on

01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:46.920
december 9th 2021 are not supported by substantial evidence in the record the district board failed

01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:52.120
to proceed in the manner required by law because the district did not provide a fair and impartial

01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:58.680
petitioning process information regarding mcms's claims can be found in item attachment one

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:04.760
mcms's allegations against the county mcms stated the following allegations of abuse of discretion

01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:12.040
by the ncboe the county board's march 15th 2022 decision to deny the mcms petition is not supported

01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:17.160
by the purported factual findings in the county's post-denial declaration findings ratified on april

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:23.080
5th 2022 the county board's post-denial factual findings are not supported by evidence in the

01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:28.200
the county board's post-denial factual findings are not supported by evidence in the documentary

01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:32.200
record the county board failed to proceed in the manner required by law when it failed to

01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:36.760
either grant the charter petition or timely adopt specific written factual findings to deny

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:45.320
so those were the petitioners allegations and now we'll go over the districts and

01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:47.240
counties written opposition to their appeal

01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:54.120
and the usd argues it did not abuse its discretion that its review process was fair and compliant

01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:58.840
and compliant with education code and that its findings in support of denial were supported by

01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:03.960
evidence in the record and the usd denied the mcms charter petition based on the following

01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:09.560
findings the petition presents an unsound educational program the petitioners are

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:15.160
demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition and the

01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:20.120
implement the program set forth in the petition the petition does not contain reasonably

01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:26.600
comprehensive descriptions of elements a through o of ed code section 47605 c5

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:32.200
the proposed charter is demonstrably unlikely to serve the interests of the entire community

01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:39.000
in which the school is proposing to locate the county written opposition to mcms's appeal

01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:48.280
ncbo e argues it did not abuse its discretion because the county board complied with all

01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:53.800
procedural obligations in the law regarding the mcms petition the county board properly

01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:59.800
adopted specific written factual findings in its support of its decision to deny the petition

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:05.800
the county board's factual findings are supported by substantial evidence in the documentary record

01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:13.000
ncboe denied the mcms charter petition based on the following finding mcms is demonstrably

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.320
unlikely to serve the interests of the entire community in which the school is proposing to

01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:25.320
locate the california department of education's review of mcms's appeal

01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:33.480
based on the cde's review of mcms's written submission documentary record and the written

01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:40.360
oppositions from the district and county the cde has determined that nbusd and ncboe did not

01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:46.760
abuse their discretion in their denials of the mcms petition a summary of the nbusd's and

01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:53.080
ncboe's findings regarding the mcms petition mcms's allegations of abusive discretion and

01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:56.200
the district and county's oppositions is provided an attachment one

01:29:56.200 --> 01:30:08.280
section 47605 k2a states the petitioner shall include the findings and documentary record from

01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:11.560
the governing board of the school district and the county board of education and a written

01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:17.080
submission detailing with specific citations to the documentary record how the governing board

01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:23.080
of the school district or the county board of education or both abuse their discretion mcms

01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:28.520
based on the cde's review of the written submission and documentary record mcms has

01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:34.200
not met its burden of detailing with specific citations to the documentary record how the

01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:38.280
district or county abused their discretion in the denial of the charter petition

01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:46.840
as will be shown in the upcoming slides mcms's written submission lacks detail and does not

01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:51.960
contain specific citations to the documentary record that support its appeal as required by

01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:58.600
statute although the petitioners did provide 63 references to the documentary record the references

01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:05.560
do not establish the evidentiary support necessary to show how the district and county abuse their

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:17.080
discretion and their decisions to deny the charter petition cde's review of mcms's claims related to

01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:25.320
the district's findings mcms states the factual findings adopted by the district board on december

01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:31.240
9th 2021 are not supported by substantial evidence in the record it is important to note that

01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:37.000
substantial evidence that term is not the legal standard to be applied in this instance is not

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:44.920
required by education code and the usd's denial was based on four findings under edco's section

01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:52.120
47605c but mcms's written submission includes only limited detail relating relating to a portion

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:58.200
of one finding and does not specifically address each finding the sbe must determine whether the

01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:04.280
district's determination as a whole constitutes an abuse of discretion the petitioners did not

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:09.400
address how the determination to deny was an abuse of discretion

01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:21.240
when addressing the district's findings the written submission contains seven end notes with

01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:26.440
citations to the documentary record however mcms has not detailed how any of these citations

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:33.400
challenge the evidentiary basis of nbusd's findings rather mcms's written submission details

01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:39.640
mcms's disagreement with nbusd's conclusions arguing that nbusd should have reached different

01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:46.840
conclusions but mcms does not explain how any of the citations supports claim that nbusd abuses

01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:53.400
discretion and denying the mcms petition mcms's written submission effectively asks the state

01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:58.360
board to come to substitute its own judgment for the districts which is not permitted under the

01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:05.480
abuse of discretion standard the next slide will give an example with a screenshot we thought that

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:12.280
might be helpful when cde staff reviewed the written submission

01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:20.680
i did mention that they had many end notes so if you look here end note number 57 cites two pages

01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:25.880
for example the district staff's report criticism of the mcms's budget is almost entirely

01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:30.440
predicated on the incorrect assumption that the school cannot meet its year one enrollment target

01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:36.200
they have an end note there so we follow the end note to see what the specific allegation of

01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:41.560
abuse of discretion is and note 57 cites two pages of findings which lists several specific

01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:47.160
facts as the evidentiary basis for the district's conclusion that the mcms fiscal plan is unrealistic

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:55.320
that's what was at the end of that particular citation citation number 58 cites two pages of

01:33:55.320 --> 01:34:00.680
mcms's response to the district's findings wherein mcms argues for different conclusions

01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:06.360
but does not challenge the evidentiary basis of the nbusd's findings and the reason we are

01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:14.920
showing an example is just to sort of in a uh to show what it was that we followed the the

01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:23.560
the department of ed as you know and we've said this before that we're not authorized by statute

01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:28.360
to consider the quality of the charter the need for the charter the value of the charter or the

01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:32.600
support for the charter our review is restricted to the review of the documentary record and when

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:38.360
there is sufficient evidence to support local decisions and so the burden is on the charter

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:47.000
to specifically cite how the district and or county boards abuse their discretion and in the

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:55.800
case of the citations that we received from the petitioners we did not find that next slide

01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:05.560
mcms's written submission then states that mcms has previously refuted all the district's findings

01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:10.680
and then cites its entire 28 page response to the end response to the district staff report

01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:16.440
however the written submission fails to include specific citations within ms mcms's response to

01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:21.800
the staff report to support their appeal and fails to explain how its response to the district

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:27.880
staff report supports its claim that the district abused its discretion and denying the mcms petition

01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:37.880
claims related to the district's findings conclusion mcms's written submission contains only

01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:43.000
limited citations and it's challenged to the district's findings lacks the necessary detail

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:48.760
to support mcms's allegation that the district abused its discretion with regard to its findings

01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:55.000
in support of denial therefore there is insufficient evidence for the sbe to find an abuse of discretion

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:59.160
related to the district's findings in support of denying mcms's petition

01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:06.200
we'll now move on to the petitioner's claims related to the county's findings

01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:13.640
mcms states the county board's march 15 2022 decision to deny the mcms petition is not supported

01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:18.520
by the purported factual findings in the county's post-denial declaration findings ratified on

01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:25.480
april 5 2022 mcms bases the above allegation on its claim that the county's findings simply

01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:32.360
parroted back the language of ed code section 47605 c7 without providing any supporting facts or legal

01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:39.160
without providing any supporting facts or legal conclusions however ncboe's findings clearly list

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:44.200
several specific facts in support of its denial of the mcms petition which have been included in

01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:52.280
attachment one the second claim related to the county's findings mcms states the county board's

01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:57.080
findings are not supported by evidence in the documentary record as it did with its challenge

01:36:57.160 --> 01:37:02.520
the district's findings mcms's written submission here contains some citations to the documentary

01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:08.200
record but does not challenge the evidentiary basis for the county's findings rather mcms's

01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:14.360
written submission argues for its own analysis and conclusions failing to explain how the county

01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:24.760
abuses discretion in denying the mcms petition here again mcms's written submission is effectively

01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:29.240
asking the sb to substitute its own judgment for the counties which is not permitted under the

01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:33.560
abuse of discretion standard therefore there is insufficient evidence for the sb to find an

01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:41.800
abuse of discretion related to ncboe's findings cd's review of procedural allegations against the

01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:51.480
district this is a recap of what the cd received as part of the documentary record mcms's claims

01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:55.480
that the district failed to proceed in the manner required by law because the district did not

01:37:55.480 --> 01:38:02.840
provide a fair and impartial petitioning process specifically mcms asserts petitioners were permitted

01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:07.720
to communicate only with the district's legal counsel the district demanded petitioners attend

01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:12.360
a capacity interview which focused on the two parent lead petitioners lack of experience to

01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:20.760
themselves for them this is a direct quote so i'll rephrase a little bit petitioners lack of

01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:25.640
experience um to operate and run the school which is not what is proposed in the petition

01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:30.040
the meeting never happened which a district cited as support for denial the district staff

01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:34.360
report is self-serving and one-sided there was no discussion amongst the district board members at

01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:39.720
the meeting on december 9 2021 where the mcms petition was denied and the video feed of the

01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:44.440
virtual meeting went blank for nearly 10 minutes during a break in the middle of the board's

01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:49.080
deliberations the superintendent and each district board member prejudged the facts before the

01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:53.720
december 9th meeting and came prepared with written statements in opposition to the mcms petition

01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:03.880
each of the statements listed on the previous slide includes a citation to the documentary

01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:09.960
record however the evidence referenced in the citation does not demonstrate how nbusd's

01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:16.200
process for reviewing mcms's petition was unfair two of the citations refer to documents that

01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:21.640
mcms itself prepared which makes similar allegations but do not specify how or why the

01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:29.160
act complained of is procedurally unfair an additional citation references a public comment

01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:33.800
made by a parent in the district but does not say why the comment is evidence that the nbusd's

01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:38.680
actions were procedurally unfair in another instance the citations refer to 28 pages of

01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:44.520
the transcript from the nbusd's board's december 9th 22 meeting 2022 meeting this citation

01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:48.360
undermines mcms's claim that there was no discussion among board members at that meeting

01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:56.280
and is not a specific citation also mcms's claims about the district's capacity interview are not

01:39:56.280 --> 01:40:03.400
supported by evidence on november 3rd 2021 nbusd emailed mcms explaining that they would not exclude

01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:07.720
other individuals from attending the meeting and that the purpose of the capacity interview for

01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:11.560
was for the charter school's leadership team to demonstrate knowledge of the petition

01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:15.480
and capacity to successfully implement it and that therefore the district's questions

01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:21.800
would be directed to the petitioners and just as a side note capacity interviews are not a

01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:26.840
requirement of the petitioning process some authorizers do it just to get to know the

01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:31.240
petitioners better and and understand their capacity but it is not a requirement of the

01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:35.880
petitioning process that's an end code additionally the fact that the board members have prepared

01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:40.600
statements which they read into the record does not demonstrate that the district did not consider

01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:45.720
the petition the staff recommendations or the mcms's responses to the staff recommendations

01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:54.920
cde's review of procedural allegations against the county mcms's claims that the county board

01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:58.920
failed to proceed in the manner required by law when it failed to either grant the charter

01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:07.000
petition or timely adopt specific written factual findings to deny pursuant to ed code section 47605

01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:11.720
the governing of the governing board of the school district and or county board of education

01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:15.800
shall either grant or deny the charter within 90 days of the receipt of the petition

01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:25.320
mcms asserts that its submission of its petition to the county on december 21 2022

01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:33.880
required ncboe to grant mcms's petition or adopt written findings to deny by march 21 2022

01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:41.720
the documentary record shows and all parties agree that ncboe voted to deny mcms's petition

01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:47.880
on march 15 2022 and adopted written factual findings on april 5 2022

01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:53.320
and that all can be found in the documentary record and the citation cited there

01:41:53.320 --> 01:42:04.840
both both ncboe and nvusd state that while mcms mcms initially submitted its petition

01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:12.040
to the county on december 21 2022 mcms failed at that time to fulfill the requirements of ed

01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:17.880
code section 47605 k1a which states the following at the same time the petition is submitted to the

01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:22.360
county board of education the petitioner shall also provide a copy of the petition to the school

01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:28.040
district the district and county provided evidence along with their written oppositions

01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:35.720
which established that mcms did not submit submit its appeal to both nvusd and ncboe pursuant to ed

01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:49.080
code section 47605 k1 ai until january 5 2022 as the mcms petition was not properly submitted

01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:56.600
in accordance with statute until january 5 2022 ncboe's 90-day statutory timeline pursuant to ed

01:42:56.600 --> 01:43:05.160
code 47605 b began on that date ncboe denied the mcms petition on march 15th and adopted written

01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:11.560
findings supporting the denial on april 5 2022 which is within the 90-day timeline required in

01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:18.040
statute because of this the cde does not find any procedural violations and therefore does not find

01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:28.760
any abusive discretion after reviewing the complete documentary record and supporting

01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:34.520
documentation submitted by the parties to this appeal the cde has determined that neither the

01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:43.880
nvusd nor ncboe abuse this discretion in reaching their decisions to deny mcms's charter petition

01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:51.800
therefore the cde recommends the sbe affirm nvusd's and ncboe's decisions

01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:57.720
to deny the mcms charter petition and that concludes my presentation

01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:07.000
thank you stephanie uh at this point i'm going to open the public hearing at 10 33 am

01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:12.680
we will first hear from petitioners representing my thomas charter middle school

01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:17.800
they will have 12 minutes to make their presentation we will then hear from nappa

01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:23.160
valley unified school district and the nappa county board of education who denied the charter

01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:29.800
appeal the district and county will have a combined total of 12 minutes after the presentation we will

01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:34.600
open up the phone line for public comment from individuals who are not part of the presentation

01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:37.560
petitioner you may begin

01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:41.880
good morning president darling hammon and board members and thank you very much for hearing our

01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:47.320
appeal today my name is lauren daley jolene yee and i are the co-petitioners for my commis charter

01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:58.520
middle school again we thank you today for your time jolene can you start the slides yes

01:44:59.080 --> 01:44:59.480
slides

01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:01.980
yes

01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:10.920
the proposal for my commis charter middle school or mcms envisions a free neighborhood

01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:14.520
school that provides a small school setting for students for whom a large middle school is

01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:19.800
problematic the plan is for a school culture steeped in social emotional learning using tools

01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:24.760
like daily advisory and a project-based learning model to help students build lasting relationships

01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:29.640
and to work collaboratively all students will have individualized learning plans and will assist

01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:34.440
in establishing their own educational goals the school is planned to be diverse by design it is

01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:39.720
located in downtown nappa near two title one schools to be easily walkable and to serve to

01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:44.840
service an underserved neighborhood the school is not designed to be a private school with public

01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:50.440
funds nor is it designed to cater to a homogeneous population as you may hear from some callers it is

01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:54.520
the exact opposite of that i'd now like to turn it over to john limo john

01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:05.400
good morning board members can everyone hear me okay i'm hoping yes um so the staff presentation

01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:10.840
i heard um is a little bit dismaying and sort of grossly misstates our appeal there are so many

01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:16.280
abuses of process here i can only focus on major ones i'm going to focus on the county and it's

01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:21.640
utter failure to uh follow the the procedure in the statute the presumption when a charter is

01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:27.000
being considered by a county on appeal or a district is that the agency shall not deny the

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:33.160
petition unless it makes written factual findings specific to the particular petition setting forth

01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:38.280
specific facts to support one of the statutory findings there's confusing because there's two

01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:43.480
kinds of findings involved here there's eight statutory findings called findings which are the

01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:49.080
basis to deny a charter and then if one of those is made by an agency it has to support it with

01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:55.800
specific facts to support that finding this has to happen at the same time the board has to make

01:46:55.800 --> 01:47:01.960
these factual findings these written factual findings in order to deny in order to deny

01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:06.600
that's the that's the due processor that's the key linchpin of the due process you can't have due

01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:11.960
process if you make a statutory finding to deny and then cobble together the findings later

01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:18.760
um as we stated to you by staff you review now uh these appeals for an abuse of discretion you

01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:25.480
selected a or cd has selected a definition that nobody else uses uh but we're stuck with it for

01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:29.640
today there are hundreds and hundreds of cases for abuse of discretion that set a different

01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:34.760
standard but what's what's at core here is there has to be evidence in the record to support

01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:38.920
what the agency did and the agency has to proceed in a procedurally fair manner

01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:44.520
next slide please i'm going to talk fast because i only got a few minutes there are multiple

01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:51.800
substantial abuses of discretion know that you the state board are the backstop here you are the the

01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:58.520
entity uh next slide please let's move on you you are the agency uh that that that calls out an

01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:04.120
abuse of discretion and sets the standard so agencies below will not act in an unfair unfair

01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:08.920
way i'm going to focus on the county here the substantial evidence in the record and substantial

01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:14.840
evidence just means uh the basis for any arbitrary or capricious action so there is there is something

01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:18.440
called substantial evidence and there's thousands of cases that describe it in the abuse of

01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:26.280
discretion context the county staff report leading up to this action on the appeal was glowing it

01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:30.520
said that the charter is comprehensive in detail that the budget is appropriate and viable the

01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:35.000
petitioners have met all legal requirements and there's a well established need and demand for

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:40.520
this charter next slide please there's a lot of the staff report about the timing and when timelines

01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:45.560
start on the appeal there's no question that and i'll show you it's a screen grab in a second

01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:51.000
there's no question that the appeal was submitted to the county on december 21 true a copy of the

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:57.000
petition not the entire appeal packet was not submitted to the district until december 31 it's

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:01.800
a new rule and we missed that you'll hear from the county district about about

01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:12.840
error that was an error on march 15th well step back for a second on february 28th the county

01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:17.640
issued its first findings which were in support of the charter they didn't recommend approval but

01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:23.080
they didn't recommend denial and they said lots of great things about the charter on march 15th

01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:27.320
it's indisputed that the board took action to deny it they didn't adopt any written findings

01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:32.040
that started our 30-day timeline to appeal we had to file our appeal by april 14th to be in

01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:37.800
front of you not until april 5th did the did the county staff cobble together their their findings

01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:42.280
to present them to the board nine days before our appeal deadline that's unlawful that's

01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:48.360
procedurally unfair next slide please the documentary record is clear that we submitted

01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:53.080
on december 21st this is a finding that the county made this is from their april 5th finding

01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:57.320
on december 21st they received the petition period next slide please

01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:05.480
in relevant part the the statute says we must provide a copy of the petition to the district

01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:10.840
at the same time we provided to the county not our entire appeal packet that was provided later

01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:15.240
but our petition was provided indisputably to the county excuse me to the district on

01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:20.200
december 31st so worst case that's the start date there's citations to the record for you

01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:30.040
right there next please they took action to deny the county took action to deny this petition on

01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:34.280
march 15th all that was made was this motion i've quoted it here that's the entirety of it

01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:39.000
that's the entirety of the action that they took there's no factual findings whatsoever written or

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
not next slide please

01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:47.720
the purported findings were drafted post hoc they were not within the 90-day statutory timeline but

01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:53.000
even so they weren't even sufficient they had different findings on february 28th that were

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:58.840
contrary to their april 5th findings we agree with cd staff report that they denied the petition

01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:04.280
on march 15th and adopted the findings on april 5th that in and of itself there was nothing else

01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:09.000
in the record that demonstrates a violation of the process and timeline and this should be

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:17.160
overturned next slide please the post-hoc findings include many statements that are not supported by

01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:21.960
the record i want to say something about this staff said that we didn't cite to the record

01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:27.080
but then they quoted the citations that we had we just cited them at the end of our brief and

01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:32.280
there's nothing there's nothing wrong with that but the problem here is the absence of evidence

01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:38.280
in the record we can't cite the things that don't exist so many of the the facts that were

01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:44.360
relied on for the findings were stated by callers on march 15th we had no opportunity to respond

01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:53.880
that's that is substantially unfair for example there's no evidence whatsoever that my

01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:57.720
comments would substantially undermine existing services academic offerings or problematic

01:51:57.720 --> 01:52:01.720
offerings that's finding 21 there's nothing in the record about that it's also false

01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:06.200
because there's another finding that they made that's the opposite of that and i encourage you

01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:11.080
to look at the february 28th findings and the pages i've cited here also in the findings there's

01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:17.080
a finding 24 that said that the district would need to eliminate middle school program and

01:52:17.080 --> 01:52:21.720
elementary school music and physical physical education programs there was no board discussion

01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:26.360
at the county of that whatsoever it can't be a finding of the board that they deliberated made

01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:33.720
that finding similar to 25 saying there was no such discussion next slide myth of the harmless

01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:37.400
error you're going to hear from the district in the county they're going to say oh yeah these were

01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:43.240
these were just harmless error violations they really don't matter well you've you've staked out

01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:49.000
your own definition of of abusive discretion harmless error exists in the 1094.5 judicial

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:54.760
standard for abusive discretion so if you want that standard great i'll take it but anyway the

01:52:54.760 --> 01:53:00.760
abuses here were not harmless we were deprived of our right to have the draft the findings that

01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:06.680
the county relied on published 15 days in advance they didn't do that we were denied we denied the

01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:11.400
charter on march 15th with no written or even spoken findings whatsoever and you just tried

01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:16.040
to fix it they tried to fix it weeks later with comments made at march 15th as evidence it's an

01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:21.960
ambush it's really what it is and the findings were ratified just days before the appeal deadline

01:53:22.840 --> 01:53:28.040
next slide please okay near the backstop here to ensure a fair and lawful process

01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:33.880
this is a high quality petition i'll just point to what the county board said and its staff of

01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:39.720
report of february 28th its findings and report there's blatant abuses here if you don't reverse

01:53:39.720 --> 01:53:44.680
this it's going to be mayhem at the district and county level no one's going to follow a process

01:53:44.680 --> 01:53:49.400
because nobody can ever win on appeal here a reversal here will ensure that districts and

01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:54.760
counties will provide due process and follow the statutory procedure for would-be petitioners but

01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:59.480
charters are supposed to be encouraged that's 47 600 of the statute the most important guiding

01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:07.960
principle lauren i'll turn it over to you so john i think i'm taking over thank you president and

01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:12.840
esteemed members of the board lauren daly and i have been described as just two moms trying to

01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:18.440
start a charter school not competent to file this petition but our resumes demonstrate otherwise

01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:23.080
we've consulted with subject matter experts with decades of experience and expertise

01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:29.240
and we drafted an exemplary 187 page petition that were far more detailed and extensive than

01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:34.680
any other petition actually approved by the district despite our impeccable credentials

01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:40.520
we have been chastised and maligned in an attempt to discredit us here are a few choice words from

01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:47.080
the hearing on december 9th dr musetti we did not understand basic regulations and requirements

01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:52.360
we had a lack of professionalism and incompetency trustee riser our petition read like sort of a

01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:58.520
hastily thrown together paper by like a freshman interested in majoring in education trustee

01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:04.280
gracia our budget was phony and we were fraudulently attempting to inflate our income these assertions

01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:09.800
were directly contradicted by the county staff report when the district uncovered metadata for

01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:14.120
school and compton from a document template trustee gracia tried to blow the racial dog whistle

01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:18.040
stating i don't know a lot of parents in the nappa valley who would want to send their children to

01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:23.960
school in compton using the compton word 14 times during his 20 minute presentation i'm not sure

01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:29.400
that trustee gracia's where that nappa student demographics are similar to compton's or that

01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:36.360
compton public schools consistently rate higher than nappa on great schools.org it is clear

01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:41.720
that the district had no intention of giving us a fair shake if they had there would have been some

01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:46.440
pros mixed in with all the cons but the entire staff presentation and the endless minutes of

01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:51.080
prepared speeches filled with vitriol not a single person said a single positive comment about the

01:55:51.080 --> 01:55:56.760
charter we thought we would have a fair shot the county but we did not we heard that the superintendent

01:55:56.760 --> 01:56:02.120
had visited english learner families the week before and told them to call in and tell you

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:09.160
until the county that we were white segregationists taking public dollars for an elitist private

01:56:09.160 --> 01:56:15.800
school and 40 parents called in and did just that after hours of this repeated message we

01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:20.920
were not surprised by the result last month at the accs hearing the commissioners got a taste of

01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:27.080
these theatrics although this time i think we're actually called racist notably one caller stated

01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:32.120
that the district had threatened county programs if ncao e approved their charter even though the

01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:37.320
county did not approve our charter my understanding is the district has full contracts with the county

01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:45.000
and will transfer national nappa special education programs out of ncoe as you vote please consider

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:49.720
our families who've watched two moms stand up again and again hearing after hearing fighting

01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:56.280
for public education and what we got in exchange we elected and public officials who called us

01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:01.320
names questioned our intelligence and competence and threatened to investigate us for made-up

01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:06.600
claims they manipulated their constituents people they are supposed to serve by threatening to cut

01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:23.960
their programs and told them to call us racist thank you if the presentation is concluded we

01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:29.080
will hear from the napa valley district and the board county board of education

01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:33.400
you combined have 12 minutes

01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:43.960
and the petitioners stop sharing so that i can share our presentation

01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:01.800
good morning thank you for the opportunity to present today my name is rabindraming law

01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:05.880

and jennifer nix legal counsel for the napa county board of education next slide please

01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:20.440
the appeal to the state board lists five grounds and can be summarized as claimed violations of

01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:26.040
the timeline evidence to support the findings and the district review process like the cd staff

01:58:26.040 --> 01:58:29.800
report finds the napa valley unified school district and nappa county board of education

01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:34.520
did not violate any procedures as part of the charter review process and therefore did not

01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:41.240
abuse their discretion the process was fair and robust next slide please upon receipt of

01:58:41.240 --> 01:58:45.160
the petition the district conveyed a team of 14 staff members to review the petition with

01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:51.080
guidance from district legal counsel and the following departments data business services

01:58:51.080 --> 01:58:57.080
enrollment human resources instructional services operations special education student services

01:58:57.080 --> 01:59:03.720
and technology next slide please the review team established the timeline reviewed appropriate

01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:08.600
statutes regulations and resources such as the california charter authorizing professionals

01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:13.960
initial charter petition toolkit charter school accounting best practices manual listen to public

01:59:13.960 --> 01:59:19.320
testimony utilize utilize an evaluation matrix develop recommendations and the assistant

01:59:19.320 --> 01:59:24.120
superintendent of business services and district legal counsel wrote findings of fact as a side

01:59:24.120 --> 01:59:28.040
note i'd like to point out that the review team went through every item in the california charter

01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:33.080
authorizing professionals initial charter petition toolkit and documented each item this

01:59:33.080 --> 01:59:39.800
documentation was included in the administrative record next slide please after a very fair

01:59:39.800 --> 01:59:44.360
unbiased and thorough review process the nappa valley board of education took action to deny

01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:50.200
the maya thomas charter petition on december 9th 2021 there were four findings for denial and 19

01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:55.160
pages of factual findings in support of denial contrary to the petitioner's statement the response

01:59:55.160 --> 02:00:00.440
did not refute each and every factual finding by district staff additionally petitioners response

02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:04.760
to district staff findings and recommendations would receive less than two hours prior to the

02:00:04.760 --> 02:00:08.360
start of the december 9th board meeting next slide please

02:00:11.880 --> 02:00:15.240
the remainder of the the remainder of the presentation will be covered by district and

02:00:15.240 --> 02:00:21.400
county staff legal counsel alex please continue thank you petitioner's appeal submission as well

02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:25.560
as their comments to this board makes a number of assertions that portray the district's review

02:00:25.560 --> 02:00:31.560
process as unfair however as the cd staff has correctly found the evidence cited by petitioners

02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:35.560
does not demonstrate that nappa valley unified school district review process was unfair

02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:41.000
in other words petitioners didn't provide citations to the record to support those assertions

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:45.960
cd staff analysis found no evidence of procedural violations and therefore no abuse of discretion

02:00:46.680 --> 02:00:50.360
in fact the primary documents in the record and the additional evidence presented with the

02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:54.600
district's opposition show that the district's review process followed the law and that it was

02:00:54.600 --> 02:01:00.280
not arbitrary or biased the evidence also shows the petitioners were given ample opportunity to

02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:04.200
respond to district staff's questions and to address the staff findings and recommendations

02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:08.520
at the district board meeting and also that they were given unlimited time for their presentation

02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:17.240
to the district board next slide please with respect to the district's findings cd staff also

02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:21.240
found the petitioners failed to meet their burden to show that the district abuses discretion and we

02:01:21.240 --> 02:01:26.440
agree with this conclusion just to summarize the appeal challenged only one of the district's four

02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:31.880
statutory grounds for denial and only two of the 24 factual findings supporting that ground

02:01:31.880 --> 02:01:37.000
the remaining grounds for denial have gone unchallenged remember that only one statutory

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:43.400
finding under 47605 c numbers one through eight is sufficient to justify denying a charter petition

02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:47.320
an appeal needs to show how each and every finding was not supported by the evidence

02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:50.760
and this appeal fails to make that showing next slide please

02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:58.040
ab 1505 is very specific in that once the district and the county have both made their decisions at

02:01:58.040 --> 02:02:02.040
the local level those decisions should stand unless it can be proven that there was an abuse of

02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:07.960
discretion contrary to petitioners council's contentions in this meeting a quasi legislative

02:02:07.960 --> 02:02:13.800
action such as approving or denying a charter school is not subject to the section 1094.5

02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:18.600
administrative standard uh administrative mandate standard on review that's for a quasi

02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:24.040
adjudicatory action a quasi legislative action is subject to a more deferential review standard

02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:27.720
and under this standard the petitioners must not must show not only that there was an abusive

02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:31.960
discretion but that they were prejudiced by the local agency actions that they challenge

02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:37.640
prejudice means that the challenged action itself resulted in a worse outcome the petitioners would

02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:43.240
have received otherwise so even if precisioners could have shown a minor procedural violation

02:02:43.320 --> 02:02:48.520
if it didn't change the outcome it cannot justify reversal this appeal presents no evidence to show

02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:53.720
how any action by either the district or the county board prejudiced the petitioners for example

02:02:53.720 --> 02:02:57.240
their challenge to the county board's timeline fails to show how the county's adoption of the

02:02:57.240 --> 02:03:02.440
findings on april 5th resulted in a worse outcome and they cannot make this showing because the

02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:07.000
outcome was the same whether the county board adopted findings on march 15th or on april 5th

02:03:08.200 --> 02:03:12.520
i will turn the present the presentation over to jennifer nix now to discuss the county board's

02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:20.680
review in more detail good morning turning to petitioners arguments against the county board

02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:25.560
the record is clear that the county board followed all procedural aspects of the charter schools act

02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:31.640
and considering the appeal from nappa valley unified as to their decision and that the process

02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:37.960
was procedurally fair as cde staff found the county board of education denied the maya commis

02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:42.200
charter middle school petition and adopted supporting factual findings within the 90-day

02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:47.000
timeline petitioners submitted their appeal petition to the county superintendent of schools

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:53.400
on december 21st however they did not simultaneously submit their appeal petition to nappa valley

02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:58.840
unified school district as required by statute without that submission and notice to the to the

02:03:58.840 --> 02:04:03.400
local district the county board did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal as of december

02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:09.080
21st the county did not sit on this issue the county superintendent reached out to petitioners

02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:14.120
and let them know that they needed to submit their complete appeal to the nappa valley unified

02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:19.800
school district in addition to the county board which they did on january 5th accordingly the

02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:25.960
timeline started on that day um this is a really important procedural aspect and it's not one that

02:04:25.960 --> 02:04:31.960
that the county board was able to just ignore particularly in this case because the local

02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:36.600
school district had concerns that petitioners had changed their petition on appeal and that

02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:42.920
remand was necessary given the date of complete submission of the appeal the record is clear that

02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:48.120
the county board took action to deny the petition and adopt factual findings in support of that

02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:53.080
denial within 90 days of the submission the petitioners are making allegations to the

02:04:53.080 --> 02:04:59.640
contrary but those allegations they are not based in fact or law so they're not based on the record

02:04:59.640 --> 02:05:05.240
before you they're also not based in law the county board followed what is a common procedure

02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:11.160
by directing staff to prepare findings that were in alignment with the record they then

02:05:11.160 --> 02:05:16.040
reviewed those findings and had them attested to by the board president prior to having the

02:05:16.040 --> 02:05:21.720
full board ratify them those findings that were drafted and adopted did nothing more than reflect

02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:26.360
in writing the rationale that the board articulated on the record in the public hearing

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:33.080
the written record here does include the public hearing itself and does include all of the

02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:38.520
documentation that was submitted to the board that they reviewed for that public hearing this

02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:43.080
process is permitted in law and it's permitted in county board policy and there's nothing that

02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:48.040
is contrary to that process in the charter schools act the charter schools act requires

02:05:48.040 --> 02:05:52.520
that the board make written factual findings but it doesn't specify that those findings have to be

02:05:52.520 --> 02:05:57.960
adopted at the same meeting at which the decision is made or that the petitioners have a right to

02:05:57.960 --> 02:06:05.320
get copies of those findings 15 days in advance to to say otherwise would effectively require the

02:06:05.320 --> 02:06:11.320
county board to adopt a staff report and it would take away the county board's discretion in making

02:06:11.320 --> 02:06:16.760
a decision and it would take away the county board's discretion to disagree with the staff

02:06:16.760 --> 02:06:21.800
report that's particularly problematic here because the county board of education doesn't

02:06:21.800 --> 02:06:27.240
actually have staff to make recommended findings right as you know the county board and the county

02:06:27.240 --> 02:06:33.160
superintendent of schools are two separately elected bodies and the county superintendent

02:06:33.160 --> 02:06:39.640
of schools runs the county office of education i do also want to note that even had the county

02:06:39.640 --> 02:06:45.800
board exceeded the 90-day timeline that timeline is not mandatory in the law the the education code

02:06:45.800 --> 02:06:53.880
in section 46 47605 subdivision k6 specifically provides that the county board can act on the

02:06:53.880 --> 02:07:01.080
petition all the way through 180 days after receipt of that petition moreover and and i do

02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:07.640
think this is important it's undisputed that this process did not actually harm petitioners at no

02:07:07.640 --> 02:07:14.120
time did they contact anybody within the county office or the county board or legal counsel to

02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:19.640
raise concerns with the way the process was was rolling out despite that they had been in contact

02:07:20.360 --> 02:07:26.280
with legal counsel and with the county throughout the process regarding other procedural aspects

02:07:26.280 --> 02:07:31.800
and also in in their petition appeal materials they don't present any argument of harm or

02:07:31.800 --> 02:07:39.000
prejudice today they did present three arguments with regard to harm or prejudice but those those

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:44.040
arguments also aren't borne out by the factual record the findings were provided to them much

02:07:44.040 --> 02:07:50.920
in advance of april 5th and they have given themselves a a date by which they had to appeal

02:07:50.920 --> 02:07:56.360
the decision but that's not a date that that anybody has argued is the date they did have to

02:07:56.360 --> 02:08:03.480
actually appeal that decision so there also was no harm from the procedure that the county board

02:08:03.480 --> 02:08:09.000
followed mr schultz could i get the next slide please i also want to touch on an allegation

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:12.760
that's made in the appeal materials that the county board's findings were insufficient

02:08:12.760 --> 02:08:18.600
because this allegation is demonstrably false the county board made 26 detailed findings of it

02:08:18.600 --> 02:08:24.280
to support its decision the findings included citations to specific facts in the record

02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:28.840
and as cde found the petitioners are not arguing that the findings were arbitrary

02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:33.400
capricious or entirely lacking evidentiary support they don't actually challenge the

02:08:33.400 --> 02:08:39.480
evidentiary basis for the county board's findings instead they argue regarding the weight that the

02:08:39.480 --> 02:08:44.360
county board gave to facts in the record which is not a cognizable argument in this abusive

02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:50.600
discretion review next slide please so in conclusion we are asking you to affirm the

02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:56.680
denials of the charter petition notably the law permits the state board to affirm the determination

02:08:56.680 --> 02:09:03.960
of the school district's governing board or to affirm the county board or to affirm both and

02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:10.200
that's that's in subdivision k2c and i listening to the charter school's presentation

02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:16.120
their arguments are entirely against the county board so we do not believe that there is an

02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:21.960
argument of abusive discretion against either the local district or the county board of education

02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:30.120
however i urge you to consider that you can affirm one or the other decision or both we do have

02:09:30.120 --> 02:09:34.600
representatives from both lea is present to answer any questions that you have regarding

02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:38.760
this matter thank you for your time we look forward to speaking with you if you have questions

02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:51.640
thank you for those presentations and at this point we'll hear

02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:55.400
we'll open the phone line for the public comment queue

02:10:46.600 --> 02:10:53.960
instructions in Spanish for callers needing translation of the request so is there any public

02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:54.360
comment

02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:59.400
okay we will open up the phone line now it looks like we have about 17 callers in the queue

02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:05.000
good morning caller please state your name and affiliation for the record

02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:07.320
you have one minute your time starts now

02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:15.640
good morning madam president and members my name is cassie mancini and i'm here on behalf of the

02:12:15.640 --> 02:12:21.400
california school employees association urging the fe to affirm the district and county board's

02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:27.880
decisions to deny the maya commis charter middle school petition csa wholeheartedly agrees with

02:12:27.880 --> 02:12:33.160
the staff recommendation the staff report thoroughly impacts each of the petitioner's claims and

02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:38.440
explains why they did not constitute an abuse of discretion or why the petitioner did not offer

02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:43.880
sufficient evidence of an abuse of discretion so i won't restate those in my remarks however i will

02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:49.800
emphasize that the board should consider the intent of ab 1505 when considering this appeal

02:12:49.800 --> 02:12:54.600
the intent of the law was to give deference to local communities and local decision makers

02:12:54.600 --> 02:12:59.800
for the state board to take the extreme step of overriding a local decision an abuse of discretion

02:12:59.800 --> 02:13:05.160
must be so egregious that its consequences mean that but for that abuse the charter would have

02:13:05.160 --> 02:13:10.840
been granted that is clearly not the case here therefore we urge the fe to affirm the local

02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:16.040
decision thank you thank you next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record

02:13:16.040 --> 02:13:24.280
you have one minute your time starts now hello this is hannah henry from nappa i am a parent

02:13:24.280 --> 02:13:30.840
of four children who have attended public school in nappa i want to urge the board to affirm the

02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:38.760
decision of nbusd and the county board in denying the maya commis petition this is taking resources

02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:48.200
away from individuals from the school district from potential students and families alone but

02:13:48.200 --> 02:13:53.160
beyond that this has been thoroughly vetted and reviewed i have been part of some of those reviews

02:13:53.720 --> 02:14:00.920
and it it is unfair the accusations made against nbusd are wholly unfair a tremendous amount of

02:14:00.920 --> 02:14:10.040
work is being done to listen to the community and create k-8 programs a arts influenced

02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:17.240
bilingual program for middle schools there's independent study there are plenty of options

02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:23.160
and we should be devoting our energy to enriching those options and supporting our school system

02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:30.040
thank you next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you

02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:31.640
have one minute your time starts now

02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:39.800
my name is kim snes and i'm a community member and a parent in nappa i have two children who

02:14:39.800 --> 02:14:44.520
are in high school in nappa right now one is at nutek i want to appreciate the board hearing this

02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:49.000
appeal i'm calling to voice my support for my campus charter middle school for a few reasons

02:14:49.560 --> 02:14:53.880
we need this innovative model in nappa they're embracing the science of learning and development

02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:58.600
in a way the district is not able to do given their fiscal situation they're going to have

02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:03.480
a smaller learning community where children are seen and known which is important my daughter's

02:15:03.480 --> 02:15:08.040
gay both of my children need this sort of smaller diverse environment they won't benefit from my

02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:11.720
account but i want other community members too they're going to have a later start individual

02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:17.080
learning plans all kinds of things the district cannot offer i believe nbusd did abuse their

02:15:17.080 --> 02:15:22.520
discretion they defined community solely on the basis of a fiscal impact that would change the

02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:28.840
employment of their employment roles if parents and students choose my account the school of course

02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:34.120
will also employ teachers so what would happen is teachers might move from the roles of nappa unified

02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:38.040
over to the charter school and those teachers are incredibly important thank you your time is up

02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:44.040
next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time starts

02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:47.160
now

02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:54.200
hi my name is jay finison i'm a parent and a community member of nappa i was a member of one

02:15:54.200 --> 02:16:00.680
of the schools that was closed it had a model very similar to my account we were not consulted

02:16:00.680 --> 02:16:07.960
whatsoever in the decision to close our school this is a very important fdl model that was

02:16:07.960 --> 02:16:15.640
created 20 years ago had a huge following had a huge waiting list and there was absolutely no

02:16:15.640 --> 02:16:23.080
compromise whatsoever with this district and as a result i know over 100 families that pulled their

02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:29.800
kids which resulted in a huge loss of ada of parents who went to private instead of sitting

02:16:29.800 --> 02:16:36.600
in our public schools and keeping them strong so if you're talking about financial or fiscal

02:16:36.600 --> 02:16:41.720
responsibility that was not followed in this case there were other options there was more

02:16:41.720 --> 02:16:47.640
compromise that could have been said and they you guys not listening to the parents is that your

02:16:47.640 --> 02:16:53.080
peril those people are bailing the public thank you right and left in this community thank you your

02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:57.880
time is up next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record your time starts now

my name is justin godi as a parent of nz usd students i ask you deny the my account's petition

02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:09.960
you may hear many today talk about the impact of this charter would have on our children

02:17:09.960 --> 02:17:14.600
i'm going to be honest with you i'm not concerned about my children i'm white i'm middle class and

02:17:14.600 --> 02:17:19.080
i'm privileged that i can afford to supplement my children's education regardless of the outcome

02:17:19.080 --> 02:17:23.240
my children will be fine i'm here to talk about the children who are not being represented about

02:17:23.240 --> 02:17:27.560
the families that can't take time off on a thursday to speak here this charter is not being proposed

02:17:27.560 --> 02:17:32.280
by struggling working class and largely latinx families that make up most of this district this

02:17:32.280 --> 02:17:36.520
charter is being pushed forward by other privileged white middle class families like myself

02:17:37.080 --> 02:17:41.160
families that can supplement their children's education this charter would take money from

02:17:41.160 --> 02:17:46.600
an already struggling district in order to recreate services for one small demographic

02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:50.120
taking from the many to give to the few by replicating systems the district has already

02:17:50.120 --> 02:17:54.680
created this charter is not in the best interest to my community as a whole please deny this appeal

02:17:54.680 --> 02:17:59.160
thank you for your time consideration thank you next caller please state your name and affiliation

02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:01.320

good morning president darling hammond vice president glubberwood and his speaking board

02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:13.800
members this is jena plate on behalf of the california charter schools association

02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:19.800
i am eager to express our support of my commons charter middle school and respectfully ask as

02:18:19.800 --> 02:18:24.520
outlined in our letter submitted friday that you reverse the local denial of this program

02:18:25.080 --> 02:18:29.400
these petitioners along with the students and families they intend to serve have been

02:18:29.400 --> 02:18:35.160
the subject of a disregard of their rights at the local level we are in the early stages of working

02:18:35.160 --> 02:18:41.400
through the implications of ab 1505 given that this body has the obligation to offer every

02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:46.440
possible consideration when faced with students and families that are asking for educational

02:18:46.440 --> 02:18:51.960
options beyond what is currently available to them we respectfully ask that you reverse

02:18:51.960 --> 02:18:58.200
the local decision to deny my commons charter middle school thank you thank you next caller

02:18:58.200 --> 02:19:01.960
please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time starts now

02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:13.160
caller ending in the last four digits 5422 you are live please start your public comment now

02:19:13.720 --> 02:19:20.520
uh yes uh thank you very much uh this is jerry brown uh as you know i was governor of california

02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:26.760
but also attorney general and i followed with great interest uh the legal discussions here

02:19:26.760 --> 02:19:33.800
and it is disappointing that the educational quality and educational opportunity is now mired

02:19:33.800 --> 02:19:40.280
in legal wrangling among the lawyers this case is pretty clear to me uh the board

02:19:40.360 --> 02:19:45.960
is pretty clear to me the board you're the board of justice and the board of inclusion

02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:51.560
this is a great charter i've read the report it's unique it's going to have individualized

02:19:51.560 --> 02:19:58.520
learning it's sensitive to low-income people and charges about racism are just outrageous so

02:19:59.560 --> 02:20:06.840
the bottom line here legally the denials below are arbitrary arbitrary is what abuse of discretion

02:20:06.840 --> 02:20:14.040
is at its essence this is a good school the county staff noted how valuable it will be

02:20:14.040 --> 02:20:21.800
and the cost to the district over 10 years they're speculating that instead of going down 17 percent

02:20:21.800 --> 02:20:28.760
because of the fall off an ada it may get down 19 percent 10 years and yet that's a very small

02:20:28.760 --> 02:20:35.400
amount over a long period of time giving the district a lot of ways to adjust look the charter

02:20:35.400 --> 02:20:42.760
schools were created to create a stimulus to the public schools to create options for families

02:20:42.760 --> 02:20:50.200
here you have some active parents in nappa trying to do right by their kids bringing in new technology

02:20:50.200 --> 02:20:56.920
small school small classes very individual this is a great charter if you guys apologize governor

02:20:56.920 --> 02:21:03.240
but the time is up down it's the death knell of charter schools please reverse this really bad

02:21:03.240 --> 02:21:09.320
decision it's arbitrary and i'm confident the courts will uphold your judgment thank you very

02:21:09.320 --> 02:21:15.160
much thank you thank you very much next caller please state your name and affiliation for the

02:21:15.160 --> 02:21:21.560

go ahead and start your public comment

02:21:35.800 --> 02:21:40.520
this is clare crofford within the public interest ab 1505 allows districts to make decisions about

02:21:40.520 --> 02:21:45.400
what is in the interest of the most students in their jurisdiction nappa county advised nv usd

02:21:45.400 --> 02:21:50.040
to take steps to remain fiscally solvent including addressing the high cost of small schools

02:21:50.040 --> 02:21:54.040
to support a stable educational system for all students the district made the difficult decision

02:21:54.040 --> 02:21:58.680
to close their smallest middle school river middle the mtms supporters are clear their intent is to

02:21:58.680 --> 02:22:03.560
recreate this option for a small number of students river serves by far the lowest percentage of high

02:22:03.560 --> 02:22:07.480
need students serving significantly lower percentages of socioeconomically disadvantaged

02:22:07.480 --> 02:22:11.880
and homeless students english learners and students with disabilities and all other middle schools in

02:22:11.880 --> 02:22:16.440
the district overall river maintained a majority white student body in a district with less than

02:22:16.440 --> 02:22:20.920
30 white student population only moving the needle slightly in the last years under district

02:22:20.920 --> 02:22:25.080
management river has significantly lower percentages of latino students in a majority

02:22:25.080 --> 02:22:29.320
latino district the petitioners are trying to make this confusing but it is very clear

02:22:29.320 --> 02:22:33.240
authorizers may consider the negative impact that potential churches have on all students

02:22:36.360 --> 02:22:40.280
thank you very much next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you

02:22:40.280 --> 02:22:42.440
have one one minute your time starts now

02:22:46.440 --> 02:22:58.680
hello hello hello hello please start your public comment now i would ask that the translators please

02:23:00.680 --> 02:23:01.880
translate into spanish

02:23:16.600 --> 02:23:19.880
okay

02:23:27.160 --> 02:23:29.880
please

02:23:46.440 --> 02:24:16.360
Good morning, my name is Pati Terrones, resident and mother

02:24:16.360 --> 02:24:22.080
of students in the public school system in Napa. My vote is no in regards to opening

02:24:22.080 --> 02:24:30.120
Mayakama school. We need to be conscious on the negative impact on the education and economics

02:24:30.120 --> 02:24:37.640
that this school will affect public schools within the district of Napa. Opening a school,

02:24:38.640 --> 02:24:50.080
for students only with exclusive privileges looks to me like a very childish and selfish

02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:56.160
tantrum. It would only affect the programs that we currently have with our students in

02:24:56.160 --> 02:25:03.880
public schools. My vote is no. As a Hispanic mother, I keep saying no in regards to opening

02:25:03.880 --> 02:25:11.360
this school and I'm against any social economic discrimination. Thank you. Next caller, please

02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:15.240
state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

02:25:15.240 --> 02:25:28.920

I am here. My name is Irma Sanchez.

02:25:58.920 --> 02:26:05.320
I'm so sorry. I'm going to ask her to come closer to the mic.

02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:40.800
I don't agree that you opened the Mayakama school because it would affect my children.

02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:44.800
I'm sorry, the rest was a little bit far. I'm going to have to ask her to get off of speaker.

02:26:59.920 --> 02:27:05.520
That was my comment. She said. Okay, thank you so much. Next caller, please state your name and

educational system

02:29:25.520 --> 02:29:27.520
educational system

02:29:31.520 --> 02:29:33.520
We've done a lot of work

02:29:33.520 --> 02:29:35.520
We've done a lot of work the last two years

02:29:35.520 --> 02:29:37.520
the last two years

02:29:37.520 --> 02:29:39.520
the last two years

02:29:41.520 --> 02:29:43.520
and we just found more

02:29:43.520 --> 02:30:13.240
two years. We do not need another school. My son has an ID. Up until now he has used

02:30:13.240 --> 02:30:34.640
all of the services from the District. Mayakama would only support 400 students and the District

02:30:34.640 --> 02:30:45.120
has 1,600 students. I say no to Mayakama. Thank you very much. Next caller, please state

02:30:45.120 --> 02:30:55.400
your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

02:30:55.400 --> 02:30:59.760
Next caller, ending with the last four digits, 9538, you are live. Please start your public

02:30:59.760 --> 02:31:09.200
comment now. Good morning, President Darden-Hammond, members of the California Board of Education.

02:31:09.200 --> 02:31:13.360
My name is Pat Andrew Jennings and I serve as the Assistant Superintendent of Instructional

02:31:13.360 --> 02:31:18.480
Services for the Napa Valley School District. In the fall of 2021, my staff participated

02:31:18.480 --> 02:31:23.480
in a comprehensive and thorough review of the Mayakama Charter Petition. I am confident

02:31:23.480 --> 02:31:28.040
in the rigorous review completed by the NDUSD staff, which determined that the practical

02:31:28.040 --> 02:31:33.840
implementation of the stated educational methodologies was not well described in the petition. Additionally,

02:31:33.840 --> 02:31:38.760
NDUSD has a variety of middle school options to meet the needs of diverse learners, including

02:31:38.760 --> 02:31:43.240
three comprehensive middle schools, one smaller language and cultural arts integration middle

02:31:43.240 --> 02:31:49.600
school, and two TK through eight grade schools. As a result of our findings, we recommend

02:31:49.600 --> 02:31:53.440
the denial of the petition on the grounds that the educational program set forth in

02:31:53.440 --> 02:31:57.840
the petition was not reasonably comprehensively described and was a duplication of district

02:31:57.840 --> 02:32:02.120
programming. I respectfully request that the State Board of Education deny the appeal before

02:32:02.120 --> 02:32:12.400
that. Thank you. Thank you. And we have a quick request. Sorry. This is an interpreter

02:32:12.400 --> 02:32:17.800
and I was asked to make a quick announcement in Spanish for those who could not be heard

02:32:17.800 --> 02:32:24.120
properly. If that's okay, if I may. Please go ahead. Thank you. Okay. I was asked to

02:32:24.120 --> 02:32:45.480
say. Thank you very much. Okay. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for

02:32:45.480 --> 02:32:58.600
the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now. Caller ending with the last four

02:32:58.600 --> 02:33:02.920
digits 4172. You are live. Please start your public comment now.

02:33:15.480 --> 02:33:40.920
Thank you very much. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:33:40.920 --> 02:33:51.640
You have one minute. Your time starts now. Caller ending the last four digits 2442. You

02:33:51.640 --> 02:34:05.560
are live. Please start your public comment. Okay. I think they have either dropped off.

02:34:05.560 --> 02:34:09.720
We'll move on. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:34:09.720 --> 02:34:18.360
You have one minute. Your time starts now. My name is Heidi and the parent. As an involved

02:34:18.360 --> 02:34:22.680
in the parent, I followed this charter application process from the beginning. And from the beginning,

02:34:22.680 --> 02:34:26.360
it was clear that the charter does not propose to do anything new or novel that is not already

02:34:26.360 --> 02:34:30.520
provided to our students. In fact, it would unfairly pull significant resources away from

02:34:30.520 --> 02:34:35.160
the 16,000 students in the district, including my own children, to support just 100 of so kids

02:34:35.160 --> 02:34:40.600
with a quasi special program. There are duplicate social, emotional programs and small school

02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:44.440
environments already in the district at the middle school level. I am worried that this

02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:48.440
proposed charter does not serve the best needs of our community as a whole. And the result would be

02:34:48.440 --> 02:34:52.680
other programs and other schools could be impacted. My assessment is that the Napa Valley Unified

02:34:52.680 --> 02:34:57.000
School District and Napa County Board of Education both did the right thing by denying the charter,

02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:02.760
did so within their scope. It is clear that the CDE staff report completely agrees that the

02:35:02.760 --> 02:35:07.000
district and county did not act in any way that abuse their discretion when they both denied the

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:12.280
charter. I hope you will consider these facts in making your decision to to affirm the denial of

02:35:12.280 --> 02:35:16.840
the charter. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the

02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:24.760
record. You have one minute. Your time starts now. Hi, my name is Gail Young and I am president of

02:35:24.760 --> 02:35:30.120
Napa Valley Educators Association. I'm a teacher and a parent of two students who have graduated

02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:35.400
from Napa Valley Unified School District and have successful careers. Please deny this petition.

02:35:35.400 --> 02:35:41.400
There was no abuse of discretion by the district or the county. Both district and county agreed

02:35:41.400 --> 02:35:48.760
the approval of this school would have a negative fiscal impact and community impact.

02:35:50.280 --> 02:35:56.600
Please follow the intent of AB 1505 and deny this petition. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller,

02:35:56.600 --> 02:36:00.120
please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:09.000
Hi, my name is David T. Gracia, trustee for NBUSD. We followed a rigorous process and staff did an

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:13.560
impressively thorough review of the charter application. The petitioners in contrast were

02:36:13.560 --> 02:36:17.720
not impressive in their presentation. They pre-recorded their presentation and didn't speak

02:36:17.720 --> 02:36:22.120
much at the meeting, remaining mostly silent. They refused to meet with district staff and

02:36:22.120 --> 02:36:27.320
submitted a 20-page document to the board by email about one and a half hours before the meeting

02:36:27.320 --> 02:36:32.680
we were set to decide the petition. Similarly, the petitioners were treated by NCOE with velvet

02:36:32.680 --> 02:36:37.800
gloves and staff bent over backwards to give them every opportunity to succeed, even going so far

02:36:37.800 --> 02:36:43.400
as to have staff not make a recommendation to the board. Still, the petition was defeated. I ask that

02:36:43.400 --> 02:36:49.640
you uphold the decisions of both NBUSD and NCOE. There was no abuse of discretion and petitioners

02:36:49.640 --> 02:36:56.120
were treated fairly at both levels. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

02:36:56.120 --> 02:36:58.360
for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

02:37:04.040 --> 02:37:05.960
Hello, this is Marisa.

02:37:06.040 --> 02:37:12.280
Hello, I am Marisa and I have a translator.

02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:14.280
Do you have a translator?

02:37:14.280 --> 02:37:16.280
Yes.

02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:18.280
Okay.

02:37:18.280 --> 02:37:20.280
Okay.

02:37:20.280 --> 02:37:30.280
I have a son who studied in the Napa district as one of the best students and was accepted by one of the best universities in the country, Berkeley.

02:37:30.360 --> 02:37:37.640
Now he is studying his postgraduate degree. He is a fruit of the Napa district. He is a teacher

02:37:37.640 --> 02:37:44.120
in one of the district schools where he is also a special education doctor in the Napa district.

02:37:44.120 --> 02:37:49.640
I do not agree in opening Mayacama because we have a new option in Unidos Middle School

02:37:49.640 --> 02:37:56.520
where a love philosophy is practiced that means taking care of the sense of belonging,

02:37:56.520 --> 02:38:05.640
and our students need this for their minds. I do not support Mayacamas. Equality for all.

02:38:09.960 --> 02:38:11.960
Hello, my name is Marisa.

02:38:13.400 --> 02:38:19.720
I have a son that studied at NBUSD as one of the best students of the district. He was accepted

02:38:19.720 --> 02:38:25.160
in one of the best universities in the country, UC Berkeley. He is now studying his master's.

02:38:25.160 --> 02:38:30.680
He is a result of the education he received at NBUSD. He is now teaching at schools in the

02:38:30.680 --> 02:38:36.520
district where he also acts as an interpreter and a bridge for special ed. I do not agree to the

02:38:36.520 --> 02:38:43.320
opening of Mayacama's middle school. We have now a great new option which is Unidos Middle School

02:38:43.320 --> 02:38:48.280
where they practice a philosophy of cariño which means caring for the students feeling of belonging

02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:54.760
where they want students to feel welcome at home and safe. That is what our students need.

02:38:54.760 --> 02:38:59.720
I do not support Mayacama's opening. Equidad para todos, equity for all.

02:39:02.120 --> 02:39:06.280
Thank you. Next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:39:06.280 --> 02:39:08.680
You have one moment one minute your time starts now.

02:39:18.360 --> 02:39:30.520
Hello good morning my name is Osorio Morales.

02:39:35.800 --> 02:39:39.240
Okay she has her own interpreter. Okay thank you.

02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:44.680
Please proceed.

02:39:48.280 --> 02:39:51.640
So

02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:31.080
Hi, we have to focus these dollars on programs that benefit our students not opening another

02:40:31.080 --> 02:40:32.080
school.

02:40:32.080 --> 02:40:37.600
My two daughters are English learners at Willow School and they received everything they needed

02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:38.840
English learners.

02:40:38.840 --> 02:40:44.600
I am not in favor of Mayakama's opening.

02:40:44.600 --> 02:40:45.900
Thank you.

02:40:45.900 --> 02:40:48.380
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

Your time starts now.

02:40:52.380 --> 02:40:56.220
Steve Green, parent.

02:40:56.220 --> 02:41:00.860
Both the district and county boards of education told NVUSD that to preserve programming it

02:41:00.860 --> 02:41:04.740
had to close inefficient small schools to avoid state receivership because of falling

02:41:04.740 --> 02:41:06.460
revenues from declining enrollment.

02:41:06.460 --> 02:41:08.140
NVUSD did that.

02:41:08.140 --> 02:41:09.140
It was painful.

02:41:09.140 --> 02:41:12.180
American Canyon gave up a promised new middle school.

02:41:12.180 --> 02:41:15.020
Napa lost small, elementary, and middle schools.

02:41:15.020 --> 02:41:18.340
NVUSD is fiscally solvent which saved programming.

02:41:18.340 --> 02:41:24.580
The Mayakama's proponents want to force NVUSD to authorize a duplicative, inefficient small

02:41:24.580 --> 02:41:25.580
school.

02:41:25.580 --> 02:41:29.500
Small classes, smaller middle school settings, duplicated by K-8 and Napa.

02:41:29.500 --> 02:41:32.540
Programs and social-emotional learning, duplicated.

02:41:32.540 --> 02:41:33.940
All duplicated.

02:41:33.940 --> 02:41:39.140
District comprehensive overall and our American Canyon middle school in particular offer better

02:41:39.140 --> 02:41:44.300
education than what's proposed.

02:41:44.300 --> 02:41:47.580
Call our American Canyon kids and degrade their education.

02:41:47.580 --> 02:41:49.060
Please vote no.

02:41:49.060 --> 02:41:53.940
Do not degrade our kids' learning and with all respect, Jerry Brown doesn't know our

02:41:53.940 --> 02:41:54.940
community.

02:41:54.940 --> 02:41:55.940
Thank you.

Your time starts now.

02:42:05.340 --> 02:42:07.740
Good morning, California Board of Education.

02:42:07.740 --> 02:42:09.180
My name is Norm Ortiz.

02:42:09.180 --> 02:42:11.860
I am a parent of an eighth grader at Redwood Middle School.

02:42:12.060 --> 02:42:17.420
A rigorous, grand, unique opportunity within NVUSD that serves many students in our community.

02:42:17.420 --> 02:42:20.300
Today's conversation should not be in any way political.

02:42:20.300 --> 02:42:24.100
All students should have an opportunity to receive the education of their choice, whether

02:42:24.100 --> 02:42:26.380
it be in public schools or charters.

02:42:26.380 --> 02:42:30.660
Being California one of the most prosperous states in our country financially speaking,

02:42:30.660 --> 02:42:35.260
the California Department of Education should continue to work closely to a lot more funding,

02:42:35.260 --> 02:42:40.340
resources for programs, services, and instruction to address the learning gaps and needs especially

02:42:40.420 --> 02:42:45.820
of social economic disadvantage impacted students such as English language learners, special

02:42:45.820 --> 02:42:48.500
education students, and foster youth.

02:42:48.500 --> 02:42:53.220
Quality variety of educational opportunities as already stated in previous board meetings.

02:42:53.220 --> 02:42:57.660
I am not against charter schools based on the information provided submitted, which

02:42:57.660 --> 02:42:58.980
is part of the record.

02:42:58.980 --> 02:43:02.660
It is my understanding based on my interpretation of the facts.

02:43:02.660 --> 02:43:05.100
It is not the best timing to approve it.

02:43:05.100 --> 02:43:09.780
I sincerely hope the right decision is reached today and that we continue to build community

02:43:09.780 --> 02:43:11.580
and fairness to all.

02:43:11.580 --> 02:43:15.580

02:44:33.780 --> 02:44:55.780
Thank you very much,

02:44:55.780 --> 02:45:00.780
staff.

02:45:00.780 --> 02:45:05.420
Spanish-speaking parents at American Canyon Middle School.

02:45:05.420 --> 02:45:11.640
In my opinion, my commas from the viewpoint has, excuse me, in my opinion, the district

02:45:11.640 --> 02:45:18.140
currently has declining enrollment and my commas would be a consideration that I would

02:45:18.140 --> 02:45:19.140
make to open.

02:45:19.140 --> 02:45:21.480
It is not necessary to open more schools.

02:45:21.480 --> 02:45:25.540
To the contrary, we need to put better efforts into our current schools.

02:45:25.540 --> 02:45:30.980
If the current education that students are receiving by, that students are receiving

02:45:30.980 --> 02:45:35.420
other parents feel is not adequate, then there are private institutions that can satisfy

02:45:35.420 --> 02:45:36.420
those expectations.

02:45:36.420 --> 02:45:40.020
No to my commas.

02:45:40.020 --> 02:45:41.020
Thank you.

02:45:41.020 --> 02:45:42.020
Next caller.

02:45:42.020 --> 02:45:43.380
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:45:43.380 --> 02:45:44.380
You have one minute.

02:45:44.380 --> 02:45:45.380
Your time starts now.

02:45:45.380 --> 02:45:48.980
My name is Marie Dyatt.

02:45:48.980 --> 02:45:51.860
I'm a parent and trauma-informed healthcare provider at NAPA.

02:45:52.860 --> 02:45:57.260
As stated before, NBUSD has and continues to create harm in the community by working

02:45:57.260 --> 02:45:59.940
persistently to block my commas from opening.

02:45:59.940 --> 02:46:04.900
The environment my commas strives to provide is desperately needed in our community.

02:46:04.900 --> 02:46:10.460
NBUSD shows a blatant pattern of unseparately worthy financially driven and unethical behavior

02:46:10.460 --> 02:46:12.580
which necessitates this appeal.

02:46:12.580 --> 02:46:18.420
They use threats, spread rumors, promote community structure and overlook community needs.

02:46:18.420 --> 02:46:22.300
Additional evidence to this claim is the recent closure of an extremely unique and

02:46:22.300 --> 02:46:25.860
valued veteran special education program for preschoolers.

02:46:25.860 --> 02:46:31.620
NBUSD has absorbed these children and their financial benefit into their own program despite

02:46:31.620 --> 02:46:36.660
doing any of the ethical preparation needed to make the transition like this.

02:46:36.660 --> 02:46:40.100
They don't listen to the parents of the children whose program serves.

02:46:40.100 --> 02:46:43.220
They blatantly stated that they didn't care if they didn't have to support it because

02:46:43.220 --> 02:46:44.220
they didn't have to legally.

02:46:45.020 --> 02:46:50.420
That says a lot about the way NBUSD functions and it is not for the benefit of the children

02:46:50.420 --> 02:46:52.060
or parents to whom it serves.

02:46:52.060 --> 02:46:54.500
Thank you, your time is up.

02:46:54.500 --> 02:46:56.700

Your time starts now.

02:47:44.700 --> 02:48:12.940
Hi, my name is Andres Ramirez and I am providing more than 16,000 students where the district

02:48:12.940 --> 02:48:17.620
supports multi-language learners, special education students, after school.

02:48:17.620 --> 02:48:24.620
16,000 students will impact them because they will have a higher education level, they will

02:48:24.620 --> 02:48:27.620
be better students, parents and citizens.

02:48:27.620 --> 02:48:36.740
250 to 300 charters is a lot of opportunities that our own 16,000 students will have.

02:48:36.740 --> 02:48:45.620
We don't need to better the opportunities for our children, inclusivity and not exclusion.

02:48:45.620 --> 02:48:49.780
I do not support my comment.

02:48:49.780 --> 02:48:50.780
Thank you.

02:48:50.780 --> 02:48:53.060

Your time starts now.

02:48:55.060 --> 02:49:12.980
Hi, my name is Sylvia Avalos and I am providing more than 16,000 students where the district

02:49:12.980 --> 02:49:17.980
supports multi-language learners, special education students, after school.

02:49:17.980 --> 02:49:31.340
Hi, my name is Sylvia.

02:49:31.340 --> 02:49:36.540
Why open another school in the county if we have had to close many other schools?

02:49:36.540 --> 02:49:42.340
It is important to focus on all of the 16,000 students currently in the district.

02:49:42.340 --> 02:49:47.700
Why separate or segregate so many children just for something unnecessary that will have

02:49:47.700 --> 02:49:50.820
a big cost to our families and the district?

02:49:50.820 --> 02:49:53.060
No to my account.

02:49:53.060 --> 02:49:54.060
Thank you.

02:49:54.060 --> 02:49:56.060

Your time starts now.

02:49:58.060 --> 02:49:59.060
Hello.

02:49:59.060 --> 02:50:00.060
Bueno, me escucha?

02:50:00.060 --> 02:50:01.060
Bueno, me escucha?

02:50:01.060 --> 02:50:02.060
Si, si la escuchamos.

02:50:02.060 --> 02:50:03.060
¿Cuál es tu nombre, por favor?

02:50:03.060 --> 02:50:04.060
¿Puede decir tu nombre, por favor?

02:50:04.060 --> 02:50:05.060
Claro que si.

02:50:05.060 --> 02:50:06.060
¿Estarion Mondragon?

02:50:06.060 --> 02:50:23.300
Ah, no, I don't need a traducción.

02:50:23.300 --> 02:50:24.300
Thank you.

02:50:24.300 --> 02:50:29.700
And thank you for your interest in opening Mayacama in our county, but we don't need

02:50:29.700 --> 02:50:30.700
it.

02:50:30.700 --> 02:50:34.980
We have great schools that are no classes discriminatory and elitist.

02:50:34.980 --> 02:50:44.300
Here are simply seen as per place, not of the best interest for our students.

02:50:44.300 --> 02:50:48.220
It is important to leave behind political and monetary interest.

02:50:48.220 --> 02:50:57.300
Here is important to take into account 50,000 students, not to 350 students.

02:50:57.300 --> 02:50:59.580
Please, Mayacama.

02:50:59.580 --> 02:51:00.580
Thank you.

02:51:01.460 --> 02:51:03.820
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:51:03.820 --> 02:51:04.820
You have one minute.

02:51:04.820 --> 02:51:09.820
Your time starts now.

02:51:09.820 --> 02:51:13.980
As board president of the NVUSD Board of Education, I would like to highlight that this charter

02:51:13.980 --> 02:51:19.180
petition was denied for very specific factual findings, including the community impact in

02:51:19.180 --> 02:51:21.460
inaccurate financial projections.

02:51:21.460 --> 02:51:24.380
There are ethical components to financial decisions.

02:51:24.380 --> 02:51:28.060
There was no abuse of discretion and emotional pleas are not facts.

02:51:28.540 --> 02:51:33.140
It is our collective responsibility to create equitable environments for all of our students.

02:51:33.140 --> 02:51:34.740
This charter does not do so.

02:51:34.740 --> 02:51:39.020
The dilutive effect an additional school has on a declining enrollment district is akin

02:51:39.020 --> 02:51:41.420
to siphoning public fund dollars.

02:51:41.420 --> 02:51:44.500
Reduction or elimination of resources and programming for thousands of middle school

02:51:44.500 --> 02:51:46.940
students is a legitimate impact.

02:51:46.940 --> 02:51:49.940
The charter would serve a narrow portion of public school students.

02:51:49.940 --> 02:51:54.060
The composition of petition signatures does not represent the unduplicated count they

02:51:54.140 --> 02:51:58.260
have tried to recruit, but need to validate their revenue projections.

02:51:58.260 --> 02:52:00.540
This charter does not mirror our community.

02:52:00.540 --> 02:52:04.780
We need to thoughtfully consider if this charter with a high risk profile will adequately

02:52:04.780 --> 02:52:06.420
serve children.

02:52:06.420 --> 02:52:13.020
And if the school is not successful, the reality is the children absorb the impact.

02:52:13.020 --> 02:52:14.020
Thank you.

02:52:14.020 --> 02:52:15.820

Your time starts now.

02:52:22.820 --> 02:52:27.740
I have read the opposition to the proposal and have been listening to the lawyers talk

02:52:27.740 --> 02:52:33.100
about timelines and disrespect the petitioners.

02:52:33.100 --> 02:52:40.260
It seems very strange to me that no one references the kids, their education, or their mental

02:52:40.260 --> 02:52:41.340
health.

02:52:41.340 --> 02:52:47.500
My economist is embracing the science of learning and development.

02:52:47.500 --> 02:52:50.820
My kids thrived with smaller learning communities.

02:52:51.820 --> 02:52:54.260
Aren't we supposed to be in this for the kids?

02:52:54.260 --> 02:52:56.940
They need options that work for them.

02:52:56.940 --> 02:53:01.580
Please support this school for the children.

02:53:01.580 --> 02:53:02.580
Thank you.

02:53:02.580 --> 02:53:03.580
Thank you.

Your time starts now.

02:53:11.940 --> 02:53:13.420
My name is Holly Zaccone.

02:53:13.420 --> 02:53:17.740
I have two children attending school in the Napa School District, a daughter in 12th grade

02:53:17.740 --> 02:53:19.540
and a son in 6th grade.

02:53:19.540 --> 02:53:21.820
Both are in dual language immersion programs.

02:53:21.820 --> 02:53:27.660
As an NBUSD parent, I'm asking that you deny the Maya Commons charter petition.

02:53:27.660 --> 02:53:33.660
My kids, along with 16,000 other Napa students, will be negatively impacted.

02:53:33.660 --> 02:53:38.140
Losing 300 students to a charter school will greatly affect the school district's budget.

02:53:38.140 --> 02:53:43.340
The last thing my kids and other Napa students need right now, after some academic losses

02:53:44.340 --> 02:53:51.340
due to the pandemic, is to lose some programs related to dual immersion and the performing arts because of budget cuts.

02:53:51.340 --> 02:53:59.340
If you approve this petition, my kids, along with their friends at school, are in danger of losing some of their educational experiences

02:53:59.340 --> 02:54:03.340
that are important to their future and their academic successes.

02:54:03.340 --> 02:54:08.340
This charter is definitely not in the best interest of our Napa community.

02:54:08.340 --> 02:54:10.340
Thank you for your serious consideration.

02:54:10.340 --> 02:54:11.340
Thank you.

02:54:11.340 --> 02:54:14.340
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:54:14.340 --> 02:54:16.340
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

02:54:19.340 --> 02:54:25.340
My name is Terri Lynn Racetti, and I am the Executive Director of Special Education for Napa Valley Unified School District.

02:54:25.340 --> 02:54:33.340
I have concerns with the charter application based upon the vagueness of the plan with regards to meeting the needs of students identified with disabilities.

02:54:33.340 --> 02:54:39.340
The plan references seeking admittance to a SELPA and then states that it would be its own LEA.

02:54:39.340 --> 02:54:44.340
However, the only special education job identified was that of a special education teacher.

02:54:44.340 --> 02:54:50.340
This leaves out many key IEP team members who are necessary to meet the needs of this group of students.

02:54:50.340 --> 02:54:59.340
In addition, the plan lacks specificity to distinguish between the needs of students with disabilities as opposed to the needs of the multilingual learner.

02:54:59.340 --> 02:55:05.340
It allocates only 45 minutes daily in totality to meet the needs of this group of students.

02:55:05.340 --> 02:55:07.340
This is not sufficient.

02:55:07.340 --> 02:55:12.340
Finally, the plan does not allow any flexibility for students with more intensive disabilities,

02:55:12.340 --> 02:55:19.340
such as those who require additional instruction for mental or behavioral health needs or for those with low incidence disabilities,

02:55:19.340 --> 02:55:23.340
all of which there are high numbers within the Napa Valley community.

02:55:23.340 --> 02:55:25.340
I recommend that you deny this application.

02:55:25.340 --> 02:55:27.340
Thank you. Your time is up. Thank you.

02:55:27.340 --> 02:55:30.340

You have one minute. Your time starts now.

02:55:33.340 --> 02:55:41.340
Good morning. David from CSCA representing classified school employees in Napa and across California and co-sponsors of AB 1505.

02:55:41.340 --> 02:55:44.340
You've heard a lot about the merits or demerits of the proposed charter.

02:55:44.340 --> 02:55:46.340
But as you know, that's not the question today.

02:55:46.340 --> 02:55:53.340
As you've heard from your staff, this is a hearing about whether there was abuse of discretion for procedural errors to rise to the level of abuse of discretion.

02:55:53.340 --> 02:55:57.340
Such errors would have to be so egregious as to amount to procedural unfairness.

02:55:58.340 --> 02:56:02.340
In this case, your staff found no procedural violations based on the requirements of the law.

02:56:02.340 --> 02:56:09.340
Therefore, if you trust the analysis of your staff, as I do, you should not reverse the decisions of the local boards on these grounds.

02:56:09.340 --> 02:56:15.340
MCMS also alleges that factual findings of the local elected officials were insufficient to deny the charter.

02:56:15.340 --> 02:56:20.340
Even if you take that argument on its face, it is not the state board's role to weigh whether the evidence is sufficient.

02:56:20.340 --> 02:56:23.340
As your staff made clear in order to find abuse of discretion,

02:56:23.340 --> 02:56:30.340
you'd have to find that the evidentiary record was entirely lacking, meaning there are no facts supporting the school district's conclusions.

02:56:30.340 --> 02:56:32.340
The petitioning charter has not even made that allegation.

02:56:32.340 --> 02:56:36.340
They therefore cannot meet the abuse of discretion standard and both school districts' decisions should be affirmed.

02:56:36.340 --> 02:56:37.340
Thank you.

02:56:37.340 --> 02:56:38.340
Thank you.

02:56:44.340 --> 02:56:45.340
Good morning.

02:56:45.340 --> 02:56:50.340
My name is Michael Juba and I'm a classroom teacher representing the California Teachers Association.

02:56:50.340 --> 02:56:58.340
The primary purpose of AB 1505 was to return control of charter schools authorizing to local school districts.

02:56:58.340 --> 02:57:05.340
CDE staff state on page four of the item that based on CDE's review of the appeal and the documentary record,

02:57:05.340 --> 02:57:15.340
Maya Commons has not met the burden of detailing with specific citations to the documentary record how Napa Valley Unified or Napa County Board of Education

02:57:15.340 --> 02:57:18.340
abused their discretion in the denial of the charter petition.

02:57:18.340 --> 02:57:25.340
The district and the county board both acted in accordance with the law in denying the charter petition.

02:57:25.340 --> 02:57:38.340
We urge SBE to support the CDE's recommendation to affirm Napa Valley Unified and Napa County Board's decision to deny the Maya Commons charter petition.

02:57:38.340 --> 02:57:39.340
Thank you.

02:57:39.340 --> 02:57:40.340

Your time starts now.

02:57:48.340 --> 02:57:51.340
Hello, it's Eric Premack with the Charter Schools Development Center.

02:57:51.340 --> 02:58:01.340
If it's one thing we're learning today is that we're all navigating some very poorly drafted appeal statutes without clarity about some key terms, processes and standards.

02:58:01.340 --> 02:58:12.340
Notwithstanding this lack of vital clarity, the rather glaring procedural errors by both the district and county boards clearly violated the key provisions of the statute in question here.

02:58:12.340 --> 02:58:22.340
Given these huge errors, we believe that the state board is obliged to make a finding that an abuse of discretion clearly occurred at both the district and county levels.

02:58:22.340 --> 02:58:31.340
We also believe the charter position has considerable merit as affirmed by county staff and that the denial at the local level should be reversed.

02:58:31.340 --> 02:58:32.340
Thank you.

02:58:55.340 --> 02:58:58.340
Hi, my name is Alan Cameron.

02:58:58.340 --> 02:59:09.340
I have family members who are graduates of the Napa Valley Unified School District, and I would like to lend my voice in support of the charter school application.

02:59:09.340 --> 02:59:23.340
I agree with Jerry Brown and it's a great opportunity with the new school to introduce new innovations and technology, which are moving very rapidly.

02:59:23.340 --> 02:59:33.340
California, of course, is leading in these areas and charter school would provide opportunities to use that new technology.

02:59:33.340 --> 02:59:47.340
There's big needs caused by the pandemic and lots of innovation to recover from the effects of the pandemic and there's federal funding available to support innovations in school safety and new technology.

02:59:47.340 --> 02:59:50.340
So I'd like to support the charter school idea.

02:59:50.340 --> 02:59:52.340
My name begins Alan Cameron.

02:59:52.340 --> 02:59:53.340

03:00:32.340 --> 03:00:33.340
Good morning.

03:00:33.340 --> 03:00:46.340
My name is Julia and I am here on behalf of here elementary school along with the rest of the community in support of not approving the Maya commerce charter school elementary school is our home.

03:00:46.340 --> 03:00:51.340
My daughter is a seventh grade currently a seventh grader and has been there since kinder.

03:00:51.340 --> 03:00:55.340
My son graduated from sheer elementary school.

03:00:55.340 --> 03:01:07.340
I respectfully disagree because I believe it will have a detrimental impact for our NBUSD students since it does not serve the best interest of the entire community.

03:01:08.340 --> 03:01:15.340
I truly believe that it does not foster inclusiveness and diversity.

03:01:15.340 --> 03:01:25.340
The other the other piece to this is also it will divert resources away from school and NBUSD students.

03:01:25.340 --> 03:01:28.340
It will duplicate services being offered.

03:01:28.340 --> 03:01:29.340
Thank you.

03:02:48.340 --> 03:02:53.660
también en mi opinión al abrir otra escuela habría menos recursos en el

03:02:53.660 --> 03:02:59.540
distrito faltando esos estudiantes que se irían a esta nueva escuela y no estoy

03:02:59.540 --> 03:03:07.500
de acuerdo y no se me hace justo el bien de unos y el mal de otros estudiantes

03:03:08.620 --> 03:03:15.300
hi my name is Eva Angelina I don't support the opening of maya camas why do

03:03:15.300 --> 03:03:19.900
we need a new school if we are closing schools for lack of enrollment it is

03:03:19.900 --> 03:03:25.180
just not logic by opening another school that NBUSD will be left with less

03:03:25.180 --> 03:03:29.620
resources since those resources will follow the students live in the district

03:03:29.620 --> 03:03:37.020
I do not agree I believe it's unfair to care for the for the well-being of some

03:03:37.020 --> 03:03:42.020
students and not look for the well-being of all students in the district no to

03:03:42.220 --> 03:03:47.820
thank you next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you

03:03:47.820 --> 03:03:53.700
have one minute your time starts now president Arlene Hammond and members of

03:03:53.700 --> 03:03:56.740
the California State Board of Education my name is Monica Reddy and I serve as

03:03:56.740 --> 03:04:00.540
a director of curriculum instruction and English learner services for NBUSD as a

03:04:00.540 --> 03:04:03.620
member of the NBUSD charter review team I reviewed the educational program with

03:04:03.620 --> 03:04:07.940
specific attention to EL services as the NBUSD is composed of 22.6% of

03:04:07.940 --> 03:04:11.380
English learners as stated in the NBUSD finding the fact that petitioners are

03:04:11.380 --> 03:04:14.340
demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the educational program

03:04:14.340 --> 03:04:17.980
outlined especially as it pertains to EL year one and two of implementation of

03:04:17.980 --> 03:04:21.220
the petition lacks significant attention to EL's expecting the head of school to

03:04:21.220 --> 03:04:24.660
coordinate EL services on top of their job duties yet the job description for

03:04:24.660 --> 03:04:27.780
the head of schools does not require background in EL services additionally

03:04:27.780 --> 03:04:31.460
this is an unrealistic expectation in year one and two of the job second GLAD

03:04:31.460 --> 03:04:34.420
is the main strategy for addressing the needs of EL's yet the petitioners do not

03:04:34.420 --> 03:04:37.500
address GLAD in the professional development plan GLAD training is seven

03:04:37.500 --> 03:04:40.940
to ten days yet the PD plan is ten days with sixteen pedagogical methods which

03:04:40.980 --> 03:04:45.620
is an unreasonable and unrealistic staff expectation lastly the EL reclassification

03:04:45.620 --> 03:04:49.460
program monitoring system fails to provide a process nor does it provide

03:04:49.460 --> 03:04:52.460
detail regarding the tools and training that will be used thank you for your

03:04:52.460 --> 03:04:55.700
careful consideration of the needs of all students and families within NBUSD by

03:04:55.700 --> 03:05:01.140
upholding the CDE staff recommendation and denial of the appeal thank you next

Napa student and also a resident of Napa County I'd like to say that bully

03:05:15.260 --> 03:05:18.780
will never say they're a bully when a bully comes to a position of power it's

03:05:18.780 --> 03:05:22.660
harder for those being bullied in this case MCS is petitioned to prove the

03:05:22.660 --> 03:05:28.740
behavior I believe strongly the proposed MCM MCMS school is a viable option that

03:05:28.740 --> 03:05:32.180
is both fiscally responsible and a diverse school that replaces both

03:05:32.180 --> 03:05:35.100
traditional and charter public options that have been stripped away in the last

03:05:35.100 --> 03:05:38.380
five years including a walkable neighborhood school that served

03:05:38.380 --> 03:05:43.300
primarily EL students I respectfully request that the board approve the

03:05:43.300 --> 03:05:47.660
petition for a charter school the MCMS Charter School in Napa thank you thank

ok yama si mis hijos acuden a una escuela pública son dos niñas con

03:06:20.780 --> 03:06:26.660
necesidades especiales si abren otra escuela van a quitar fondos a nuestra

03:06:26.660 --> 03:06:31.300
escuela y eso afectaría a mis hijos ya que en sus programas ellos reciben a

03:06:31.300 --> 03:06:37.660
diferentes programas porque ellos necesitan mucho esos programas y para

03:06:37.660 --> 03:06:43.820
ello no estoy a favor de que abran maya camas porque eso afectaría su nivel

03:06:43.820 --> 03:06:46.460
académico

03:06:46.860 --> 03:06:52.740
hi my name is Edma Sanchez good morning my kids attend a public school I have

03:06:52.740 --> 03:06:57.100
two boys with special needs if you open my akama's it will take away funding

03:06:57.100 --> 03:07:01.020
from public schools that will affect my kids learning and the programs that they

03:07:01.020 --> 03:07:06.020
have access to to keep them on a good academic level besides the support that

03:07:06.020 --> 03:07:10.180
they receive with their special needs I am not in favor of opening my akama's

03:07:10.180 --> 03:07:17.460
as it will only help 300 students thank you thank you next caller please state

03:07:17.460 --> 03:07:22.460
your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time starts now

hello hello

03:07:30.460 --> 03:07:36.260
tengo mi propia interpretación mi nombre es elva marquez madre de tres estudiantes

03:07:36.260 --> 03:07:41.980
en el sitio escolar de napa en the usb si tiene un programa para apoyar a

03:07:41.980 --> 03:07:47.540
niños que quieran estar en un lugar más más pequeño que son los programas de tk

03:07:47.540 --> 03:07:53.180
octavo grado en brown valley and sheer nb usb también of frese a muchos

03:07:53.180 --> 03:07:57.300
recursos que pueden apoyar emocionalmente a nuestros estudiantes

03:07:57.300 --> 03:08:02.260
desde los centros de recursos familiares los centros de bienestar hay un una

03:08:02.260 --> 03:08:07.020
era un programa taller de herramientas emocionales también ofrecen durante la

03:08:07.020 --> 03:08:11.780
clase los círculos de comunidad y también clases de auditoria donde los

03:08:11.780 --> 03:08:15.740
niños pueden reunirse esta idea de que el distrito no está ofreciendo los

03:08:15.780 --> 03:08:21.580
programas que maya camas está tratando de implementar es falso es importante que

03:08:21.580 --> 03:08:25.500
estos fondos se requieran para los programas actuales y las escuelas

03:08:25.500 --> 03:08:30.620
actuales no para empezar algo nuevo que solo beneficiaría a unos cuantos

03:08:30.620 --> 03:08:35.620
estudiantes so nb usb oh i'm sorry my name is elva marquez and i am the parent

03:08:35.620 --> 03:08:41.540
of three students within the school nbu school district nb usb does have and

03:08:41.540 --> 03:08:46.180
provide a small school setting for middle schoolers it's a tk through a

03:08:46.180 --> 03:08:51.300
program in brown valley and sheer nb usb also has a large amount of social

03:08:51.300 --> 03:08:54.980
emotional support within their schools they have family resource centers

03:08:54.980 --> 03:08:59.620
wellness centers there's also an emotional tool kit that is implemented

03:08:59.620 --> 03:09:03.860
in every school we offer community circles during school class and for

03:09:03.860 --> 03:09:07.260
middle schoolers and high schoolers there's an advisory class it is

03:09:07.260 --> 03:09:11.140
important that the funds that we do have are implemented in the current

03:09:11.140 --> 03:09:15.620
program and this idea that maya camas will offer something different that is

03:09:15.620 --> 03:09:22.060
not already in place within nb usb it's a lie it will only be able to support a

03:09:22.060 --> 03:09:26.900
small amount of the community where the rest of the community if they can only

03:09:26.900 --> 03:09:32.540
support less than 400 students thank you thank you next caller please state your

03:11:02.460 --> 03:11:04.460
I think she's talking.

03:11:04.460 --> 03:11:06.460
Take a flower.

03:11:10.460 --> 03:11:12.460
Yes, please say your name.

03:11:12.460 --> 03:11:14.460
Can I talk now?

03:11:14.460 --> 03:11:16.460
Yes, you can talk.

03:11:16.460 --> 03:11:18.460
I'm talking to...

03:11:18.460 --> 03:11:20.460
I want to add

03:11:20.460 --> 03:11:22.460
that I don't agree with the

03:11:22.460 --> 03:11:24.460
Mayakama Charter

03:11:24.460 --> 03:11:26.460
because it's not a really inclusive

03:11:26.460 --> 03:11:28.460
program because the opportunity

03:11:28.460 --> 03:11:30.460
would be for a few children.

03:11:30.460 --> 03:11:32.460
Currently, as they said

03:11:32.460 --> 03:11:34.460
in another previous comment,

03:11:34.460 --> 03:11:36.460
there are already programs that

03:11:36.460 --> 03:11:38.460
they are supposedly offering.

03:11:38.460 --> 03:11:40.460
Somehow I feel...

03:11:40.460 --> 03:11:42.460
Wait, wait.

03:11:42.460 --> 03:11:44.460
I'm sorry, I do not agree with

03:11:44.460 --> 03:11:46.460
opening the Mayakama.

03:11:46.460 --> 03:11:48.460
Actually, just for a few children.

03:11:48.460 --> 03:11:50.460
Okay, continue.

03:11:50.460 --> 03:11:52.460
I feel frustrated

03:11:52.460 --> 03:11:54.460
to see that

03:11:54.460 --> 03:11:56.460
because of the capriciousness of some

03:11:56.460 --> 03:11:58.460
people

03:11:58.460 --> 03:12:00.460
from a high elite,

03:12:00.460 --> 03:12:02.460
many children from the middle and

03:12:02.460 --> 03:12:04.460
lower classes are going to

03:12:04.460 --> 03:12:06.460
be without many resources.

03:12:06.460 --> 03:12:08.460
I thought that there was no

03:12:08.460 --> 03:12:10.460
corruption in this country

03:12:10.460 --> 03:12:12.460
like in Mexico, but with all

03:12:12.460 --> 03:12:14.460
that has been happening,

03:12:14.460 --> 03:12:16.460
I think...

03:12:16.460 --> 03:12:18.460
Wait a minute.

03:12:18.460 --> 03:12:20.460
In the community, who have

03:12:20.460 --> 03:12:22.460
higher sources of income

03:12:22.460 --> 03:12:24.460
are not allowing

03:12:24.460 --> 03:12:26.460
some of us with lower and middle

03:12:26.460 --> 03:12:28.460
incomes for our children's education.

03:12:28.460 --> 03:12:30.460
Continue, please.

03:12:44.460 --> 03:12:46.460
I feel that this program is a

03:12:46.460 --> 03:12:48.460
racist program and that we are being

03:12:48.460 --> 03:12:50.460
discriminated at a large

03:12:50.460 --> 03:12:52.460
proportion within this community.

03:13:16.460 --> 03:13:18.460
And I ask that

03:13:18.460 --> 03:13:20.460
you properly analyze this project

03:13:20.460 --> 03:13:22.460
because I do not believe that it is

03:13:22.460 --> 03:13:24.460
for the good of the community.

03:13:36.460 --> 03:13:38.460
I believe that if you

03:13:38.460 --> 03:13:40.460
take this decision, it must be for

03:13:40.460 --> 03:13:42.460
the good of the community, not just a few.

03:13:46.460 --> 03:13:48.460
Thank you.

03:13:50.460 --> 03:13:52.460
Next caller, please state your

03:13:52.460 --> 03:13:54.460
name and affiliation for the record.

03:13:54.460 --> 03:13:56.460
You have one minute. Your time

03:13:56.460 --> 03:13:58.460
starts now.

03:14:02.460 --> 03:14:04.460
Good afternoon. My name is

03:14:04.460 --> 03:14:06.460
Wendy Agen-Seminges, parent of

03:14:06.460 --> 03:14:08.460
a special education middle school

03:14:08.460 --> 03:14:10.460
student, rapidly declining

03:14:10.460 --> 03:14:12.460
student achievement and a one-size-fits-all

03:14:12.460 --> 03:14:14.460
model within MVSD and

03:14:14.460 --> 03:14:16.460
their special education support system

03:14:16.460 --> 03:14:18.460
has left me with the only option to

03:14:18.460 --> 03:14:20.460
remove my special education student

03:14:20.460 --> 03:14:22.460
from MVSD. I was

03:14:22.460 --> 03:14:24.460
hopeful my commas would be approved in time

03:14:24.460 --> 03:14:26.460
for my son to start this fall.

03:14:26.460 --> 03:14:28.460
However, there is still an opportunity for all

03:14:28.460 --> 03:14:30.460
MVSD middle schoolers to benefit from

03:14:30.460 --> 03:14:32.460
this innovative program, open

03:14:32.460 --> 03:14:34.460
to all and not available at any public

03:14:34.460 --> 03:14:36.460
school in Napa Valley.

03:14:36.460 --> 03:14:38.460
The Association of Medical American

03:14:38.460 --> 03:14:40.460
Educators Journal states the most

03:14:40.460 --> 03:14:42.460
powerful predictor of change in reading and math

03:14:42.460 --> 03:14:44.460
in all models was decreasing the student

03:14:44.460 --> 03:14:46.460
teacher ratio with larger gains

03:14:46.460 --> 03:14:48.460
especially for Hispanic and low special

03:14:48.460 --> 03:14:50.460
education services. My commas

03:14:50.460 --> 03:14:52.460
fills this need. I feel

03:14:52.460 --> 03:14:54.460
certain that MCMS would have not only

03:14:54.460 --> 03:14:56.460
met my son's special education needs with

03:14:56.460 --> 03:14:58.460
their innovative education plans but would have

03:14:58.460 --> 03:15:00.460
helped him thrive. I implore you to

03:15:00.460 --> 03:15:02.460
support the my commas charter middle school

03:15:02.460 --> 03:15:04.460
petition.

03:15:04.460 --> 03:15:06.460
Thank you. Next

03:15:06.460 --> 03:15:08.460
caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:15:08.460 --> 03:15:10.460
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

03:15:12.460 --> 03:15:14.460
Hi, my name is Will

03:15:14.460 --> 03:15:16.460
Daley. I am a parent

03:15:16.460 --> 03:15:18.460
of a Napa

03:15:18.460 --> 03:15:20.460
school system child.

03:15:20.460 --> 03:15:22.460
You know, we hear

03:15:22.460 --> 03:15:24.460
lots of accusations of racism

03:15:24.460 --> 03:15:26.460
and what not. Those are misplaced.

03:15:26.460 --> 03:15:28.460
There's no

03:15:28.460 --> 03:15:30.460
coincidence that a lot of people protesting

03:15:30.460 --> 03:15:32.460
my commas have the exact

03:15:32.460 --> 03:15:34.460
same talking points. They've been handed them

03:15:34.460 --> 03:15:36.460
by the administration that is trying to make

03:15:36.460 --> 03:15:38.460
this about race. It's not.

03:15:38.460 --> 03:15:40.460
It's actually about providing an

03:15:40.460 --> 03:15:42.460
opportunity for Napa

03:15:42.460 --> 03:15:44.460
to institute an innovative program

03:15:44.460 --> 03:15:46.460
that hopefully will get fed back into the school.

03:15:46.460 --> 03:15:48.460
The administration doesn't want to hear

03:15:48.460 --> 03:15:50.460
it. They don't want to hear from parents

03:15:50.460 --> 03:15:52.460
about why they're taking their kids out of the

03:15:52.460 --> 03:15:54.460
school system.

03:15:54.460 --> 03:15:56.460
Unfortunately, we're stuck in

03:15:56.460 --> 03:15:58.460
a vicious cycle.

03:15:58.460 --> 03:16:00.460
It's going to keep happening. We're going to keep losing people.

03:16:00.460 --> 03:16:02.460
Because of the sort of intimidation

03:16:02.460 --> 03:16:04.460
that's going on by the administration,

03:16:04.460 --> 03:16:06.460
it's not a racist school. It's

03:16:06.460 --> 03:16:08.460
designed for everyone. Thank you very much.

03:16:08.460 --> 03:16:10.460
Thank you. Next caller, please state

03:16:10.460 --> 03:16:12.460
your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute.

03:16:12.460 --> 03:16:14.460
Your time starts now.

03:16:18.460 --> 03:16:20.460
Hello. My name is Anne Swinburne

03:16:20.460 --> 03:16:22.460
and I'm a charter school policy expert

03:16:22.460 --> 03:16:24.460
with the California Teachers Association.

03:16:24.460 --> 03:16:26.460
And I am also

03:16:26.460 --> 03:16:28.460
an expert on the requirements of AB 1505.

03:16:28.460 --> 03:16:30.460
I have followed

03:16:30.460 --> 03:16:32.460
the MCMS petition from the very beginning

03:16:32.460 --> 03:16:34.460
and it is very clear that this appeal

03:16:34.460 --> 03:16:36.460
should be denied by the State Board of Education

03:16:36.460 --> 03:16:38.460
for all the good reasons that the CDE,

03:16:38.460 --> 03:16:40.460
the district, and the county have cited.

03:16:40.460 --> 03:16:42.460
The petitioners and their attorneys

03:16:42.460 --> 03:16:44.460
are doing a very strong job of attempting to

03:16:44.460 --> 03:16:46.460
confuse or make murky what is a very

03:16:46.460 --> 03:16:48.460
straightforward issue. There was no

03:16:48.460 --> 03:16:50.460
abuse of discretion committed by either

03:16:50.460 --> 03:16:52.460
the district or the county.

03:16:52.460 --> 03:16:54.460
Please don't allow the courtroom tactics you're

03:16:54.460 --> 03:16:56.460
experiencing from the petitioners and their team

03:16:56.460 --> 03:16:58.460
to sway you. The law is clear.

03:16:58.460 --> 03:17:00.460
Please deny this appeal as

03:17:00.460 --> 03:17:02.460
AB 1505 intended. Thank you.

03:17:02.460 --> 03:17:04.460
Thank you.

03:17:04.460 --> 03:17:06.460
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

03:17:06.460 --> 03:17:08.460
for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

03:17:14.460 --> 03:17:16.460
Hi. My name is Sylvia Regalado-Zacklott.

03:17:16.460 --> 03:17:18.460
I am a parent of the Napa Valley Unified

03:17:18.460 --> 03:17:20.460
School District having kids

03:17:20.460 --> 03:17:22.460
currently in

03:17:22.460 --> 03:17:24.460
K through 9th grade

03:17:24.460 --> 03:17:26.460
schools

03:17:26.460 --> 03:17:28.460
here. I think one thing

03:17:28.460 --> 03:17:30.460
is really evidently clear.

03:17:30.460 --> 03:17:32.460
Our school system is not funded

03:17:32.460 --> 03:17:34.460
to the level that the state should be

03:17:34.460 --> 03:17:36.460
funding it at, and it's instead

03:17:36.460 --> 03:17:38.460
dividing families and communities

03:17:38.460 --> 03:17:40.460
because that funding is not

03:17:40.460 --> 03:17:42.460
available so that we can incorporate

03:17:42.460 --> 03:17:44.460
all of these really great programs.

03:17:44.460 --> 03:17:46.460
I would like to express

03:17:46.460 --> 03:17:48.460
that I would like to see the charter denied.

03:17:48.460 --> 03:17:50.460
I believe that the district

03:17:50.460 --> 03:17:52.460
made due diligence, the county

03:17:52.460 --> 03:17:54.460
made its due diligence, heard from

03:17:54.460 --> 03:17:56.460
community members about

03:17:56.460 --> 03:17:58.460
how funding would be diverted

03:17:58.460 --> 03:18:00.460
away from our schools for all

03:18:00.460 --> 03:18:02.460
and being able to implement programs.

03:18:02.460 --> 03:18:04.460
Instead, I would like

03:18:04.460 --> 03:18:06.460
to see the state and this board's

03:18:06.460 --> 03:18:08.460
efforts consolidated

03:18:08.460 --> 03:18:10.460
towards working with local

03:18:10.460 --> 03:18:12.460
school districts and counties so that our

03:18:12.460 --> 03:18:14.460
school systems can be funded to the levels

03:18:14.460 --> 03:18:16.460
that they need to be funded so that our

03:18:16.460 --> 03:18:18.460
teachers and our students can thrive

03:18:18.460 --> 03:18:20.460
and all of our other kids in our

03:18:20.460 --> 03:18:22.460
community throughout California can

03:18:22.460 --> 03:18:24.460
thrive as well. Thank you.

03:18:24.460 --> 03:18:26.460
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

03:18:26.460 --> 03:18:28.460
for the record. You have one minute. Your time

03:18:28.460 --> 03:18:30.460
starts now.

03:18:32.460 --> 03:18:34.460
Good afternoon,

03:18:34.460 --> 03:18:36.460
state board members. My name is

03:18:36.460 --> 03:18:38.460
Nivna Castrejon. I am the president and CEO

03:18:38.460 --> 03:18:40.460
of the California Charter Schools Association

03:18:40.460 --> 03:18:42.460
and I'm very familiar

03:18:42.460 --> 03:18:44.460
with the terms of 1505

03:18:44.460 --> 03:18:46.460
as they radically transformed the

03:18:46.460 --> 03:18:48.460
way in which charter schools

03:18:48.460 --> 03:18:50.460
could continue to be

03:18:50.460 --> 03:18:52.460
authorized by

03:18:52.460 --> 03:18:54.460
all of the authorizers across the state.

03:18:54.460 --> 03:18:56.460
I certainly understand that there

03:18:56.460 --> 03:18:58.460
is some confusion in many ways

03:18:58.460 --> 03:19:00.460
around how schools should be authorized

03:19:00.460 --> 03:19:02.460
and what the abuse of

03:19:02.460 --> 03:19:04.460
discretion standard is.

03:19:04.460 --> 03:19:06.460
But let me be clear, as having

03:19:06.460 --> 03:19:08.460
been a party to those negotiations,

03:19:08.460 --> 03:19:10.460
it is absolutely clear that the North

03:19:10.460 --> 03:19:12.460
Star of charter schools

03:19:12.460 --> 03:19:14.460
existing for and in

03:19:14.460 --> 03:19:16.460
response to the needs of

03:19:16.460 --> 03:19:18.460
families who are here petitioning

03:19:18.460 --> 03:19:20.460
for an

03:19:20.460 --> 03:19:22.460
establishment of a school that meets their

03:19:22.460 --> 03:19:24.460
needs and broadens the appeal

03:19:24.460 --> 03:19:26.460
of choices and opportunities for all

03:19:26.460 --> 03:19:28.460
students

03:19:28.460 --> 03:19:30.460
is of paramount importance here. 1505

03:19:30.460 --> 03:19:32.460
is clear on what

03:19:32.460 --> 03:19:34.460
the standards of

03:19:34.460 --> 03:19:36.460
evidence that districts and authorizers

03:19:36.460 --> 03:19:38.460
must present. They simply

03:19:38.460 --> 03:19:40.460
have not met that standard.

03:19:40.460 --> 03:19:42.460
Thank you.

03:19:42.460 --> 03:19:44.460
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

03:19:44.460 --> 03:19:46.460
for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts

03:19:46.460 --> 03:19:48.460
now.

03:19:50.460 --> 03:19:52.460
My name is Deirdre Wheeler and I am an

03:19:52.460 --> 03:19:54.460
alumni of California public schools

03:19:54.460 --> 03:19:56.460
including UC Berkeley. I'm also an

03:19:56.460 --> 03:19:58.460
advocate of public education.

03:19:58.460 --> 03:20:00.460
I've lived in Napa since 2008

03:20:00.460 --> 03:20:02.460
and have two children in the school district

03:20:02.460 --> 03:20:04.460
and all I can say is that I have

03:20:04.460 --> 03:20:06.460
completely lost my faith in our educational

03:20:06.460 --> 03:20:08.460
system because of how the district

03:20:08.460 --> 03:20:10.460
and county have behaved over the

03:20:10.460 --> 03:20:12.460
last couple of years, including

03:20:12.460 --> 03:20:14.460
in regards to this charter school in particular.

03:20:14.460 --> 03:20:16.460
Enrollment is sharply declining

03:20:16.460 --> 03:20:18.460
because of the district and its actions.

03:20:18.460 --> 03:20:20.460
Denying this charter has

03:20:20.460 --> 03:20:22.460
only made it worse and will continue to.

03:20:22.460 --> 03:20:24.460
I very much support my

03:20:24.460 --> 03:20:26.460
comments. We need it in our community.

03:20:26.460 --> 03:20:28.460
It has a quality

03:20:28.460 --> 03:20:30.460
educational program and it's very

03:20:30.460 --> 03:20:32.460
equitable, sorely needed in this

03:20:32.460 --> 03:20:34.460
community. Please don't lose

03:20:34.460 --> 03:20:36.460
any more families over this because

03:20:36.460 --> 03:20:38.460
it is happening because we

03:20:38.460 --> 03:20:40.460
do not have good schools in our

03:20:40.460 --> 03:20:42.460
district and are only getting worse.

03:20:42.460 --> 03:20:44.460
Thank you very much.

03:20:44.460 --> 03:20:46.460
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name

03:20:46.460 --> 03:20:48.460
and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time

03:20:48.460 --> 03:20:50.460
starts now.

03:20:54.460 --> 03:20:56.460
Caller, ending

03:20:56.460 --> 03:20:58.460
with the last four digits, 2629,

03:20:58.460 --> 03:21:00.460
you are now live. Please start your

03:21:00.460 --> 03:21:02.460
public comment.

03:21:02.460 --> 03:21:04.460
Yes, this is John

03:21:04.460 --> 03:21:06.460
from Napa and I'm a parent

03:21:06.460 --> 03:21:08.460
of two school-age

03:21:08.460 --> 03:21:10.460
children.

03:21:10.460 --> 03:21:12.460
This whole process has been

03:21:12.460 --> 03:21:14.460
extremely frustrating by

03:21:14.460 --> 03:21:16.460
watching the politics

03:21:16.460 --> 03:21:18.460
that have come to the surface here

03:21:18.460 --> 03:21:20.460
in Napa. Meanwhile,

03:21:20.460 --> 03:21:22.460
the school has been closing

03:21:22.460 --> 03:21:24.460
the

03:21:24.460 --> 03:21:26.460
good options that had existed for

03:21:26.460 --> 03:21:28.460
kids in our community, including

03:21:28.460 --> 03:21:30.460
our kids

03:21:30.460 --> 03:21:32.460
and we have reached

03:21:32.460 --> 03:21:34.460
the point of where we've pulled

03:21:34.460 --> 03:21:36.460
one kid out and are paying money to

03:21:36.460 --> 03:21:38.460
send her to private

03:21:38.460 --> 03:21:40.460
school and are struggling

03:21:40.460 --> 03:21:42.460
with what to do next. The options

03:21:42.460 --> 03:21:44.460
that had existed would have been

03:21:44.460 --> 03:21:46.460
a much better situation than are now

03:21:46.460 --> 03:21:48.460
and

03:21:48.460 --> 03:21:50.460
it seems the politics

03:21:50.460 --> 03:21:52.460
and the lobbying efforts

03:21:52.460 --> 03:21:54.460
behind the scenes have been pretty blatant to those

03:21:54.460 --> 03:21:56.460
of us here in Napa.

03:21:56.460 --> 03:21:58.460
Thank you.

03:21:58.460 --> 03:22:00.460
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

03:22:00.460 --> 03:22:02.460
for the record. You have one minute. Your time

03:22:02.460 --> 03:22:04.460
starts now.

03:22:06.460 --> 03:22:08.460
I'm just calling in

03:22:08.460 --> 03:22:10.460
support of

03:22:10.460 --> 03:22:12.460
my promise. I'm really

03:22:12.460 --> 03:22:14.460
disappointed with

03:22:14.460 --> 03:22:16.460
what the last

03:22:16.460 --> 03:22:18.460
caller said.

03:22:18.460 --> 03:22:20.460
How political

03:22:20.460 --> 03:22:22.460
this has all gotten

03:22:22.460 --> 03:22:24.460
around the school.

03:22:24.460 --> 03:22:26.460
So I'm just

03:22:26.460 --> 03:22:28.460
calling to express my support.

03:22:28.460 --> 03:22:30.460
Thank you very much.

03:22:30.460 --> 03:22:32.460
Thank you. Next caller, please state

03:22:32.460 --> 03:22:34.460
your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute.

03:22:34.460 --> 03:22:36.460
Your time starts now.

03:22:38.460 --> 03:22:40.460
Caller, ending in the last

03:22:40.460 --> 03:22:42.460
four digits.

03:22:42.460 --> 03:22:44.460
Go ahead.

03:22:44.460 --> 03:22:46.460
Yes. My name is

03:22:46.460 --> 03:22:48.460
Jamoke Hinton. I'm with the California Charter

03:22:48.460 --> 03:22:50.460
School Association

03:22:50.460 --> 03:22:52.460
and I would hope that

03:22:52.460 --> 03:22:54.460
again previous callers

03:22:54.460 --> 03:22:56.460
we would note that

03:22:56.460 --> 03:22:58.460
politics is not necessary when we're looking

03:22:58.460 --> 03:23:00.460
at quality of education.

03:23:00.460 --> 03:23:02.460
So we support

03:23:02.460 --> 03:23:04.460
this

03:23:04.460 --> 03:23:06.460
vote as it's going forward. Thank you.

03:23:06.460 --> 03:23:08.460
Thank you.

03:23:08.460 --> 03:23:10.460
That concludes public comment for

03:23:10.460 --> 03:23:12.460
item number 12.

03:23:16.460 --> 03:23:18.460
Thank you very much.

03:23:18.460 --> 03:23:20.460
At this point, I'd

03:23:20.460 --> 03:23:22.460
like to ask our liaisons,

03:23:22.460 --> 03:23:24.460
Vice President Glover-Woods and

03:23:24.460 --> 03:23:26.460
Member Olkens, if they'd like to make some

03:23:26.460 --> 03:23:28.460
initial comments as we go into board

03:23:28.460 --> 03:23:30.460
discussion.

03:23:30.460 --> 03:23:32.460
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond.

03:23:32.460 --> 03:23:34.460
First of all, I'd like to thank

03:23:34.460 --> 03:23:36.460
the petitioners and the

03:23:36.460 --> 03:23:38.460
district and county representatives for their

03:23:38.460 --> 03:23:40.460
presentation today and

03:23:40.460 --> 03:23:42.460
mostly would like to thank

03:23:42.460 --> 03:23:44.460
all of the callers who called in during public comment.

03:23:44.460 --> 03:23:46.460
It's quite evident that

03:23:46.460 --> 03:23:48.460
there are strong feelings and passions

03:23:48.460 --> 03:23:50.460
on both sides of the item

03:23:50.460 --> 03:23:52.460
that we have before us today.

03:23:52.460 --> 03:23:54.460
I just

03:23:54.460 --> 03:23:56.460
wanted to take a moment to

03:23:56.460 --> 03:23:58.460
really bring

03:23:58.460 --> 03:24:00.460
back to the forefront the two choices

03:24:00.460 --> 03:24:02.460
that we have in front of us.

03:24:02.460 --> 03:24:04.460
And based upon the

03:24:04.460 --> 03:24:06.460
information that we have received

03:24:06.460 --> 03:24:08.460
and this public hearing,

03:24:08.460 --> 03:24:10.460
we as a board need to decide

03:24:10.460 --> 03:24:12.460
one of two things.

03:24:12.460 --> 03:24:14.460
We need to decide if we will

03:24:14.460 --> 03:24:16.460
reverse the decision that

03:24:16.460 --> 03:24:18.460
was made by Napa Valley Unified School District

03:24:18.460 --> 03:24:20.460
and the Napa County Board of Education

03:24:20.460 --> 03:24:22.460
because we feel that there

03:24:22.460 --> 03:24:24.460
is evidence that there was an abuse of

03:24:24.460 --> 03:24:26.460
discretion by the county

03:24:26.460 --> 03:24:28.460
and the district

03:24:28.460 --> 03:24:30.460
or

03:24:30.460 --> 03:24:32.460
we can choose

03:24:32.460 --> 03:24:34.460
that.

03:24:34.460 --> 03:24:36.460
In other words, I should have announced

03:24:36.460 --> 03:24:38.460
that we've closed the public hearing

03:24:38.460 --> 03:24:40.460
at 12, 12 p.m.

03:24:40.460 --> 03:24:42.460
Please continue.

03:24:42.460 --> 03:24:44.460
Thank you, thank you.

03:24:44.460 --> 03:24:46.460
So going back to the two

03:24:46.460 --> 03:24:48.460
decisions that we have in front of us.

03:24:48.460 --> 03:24:50.460
One would be to reverse the decision

03:24:50.460 --> 03:24:52.460
that was made by the district and the

03:24:52.460 --> 03:24:54.460
county board because we feel

03:24:54.460 --> 03:24:56.460
that there is evidence in the documentary

03:24:56.460 --> 03:24:58.460
record that there was an

03:24:58.460 --> 03:25:00.460
abuse of discretion made

03:25:00.460 --> 03:25:02.460
by the district and the county board.

03:25:02.460 --> 03:25:04.460
Or we would uphold

03:25:04.460 --> 03:25:06.460
the decision made by both of those

03:25:06.460 --> 03:25:08.460
entities and that decision was

03:25:08.460 --> 03:25:10.460
that they denied the charter petition.

03:25:10.460 --> 03:25:12.460
The last piece I'd like to

03:25:12.460 --> 03:25:14.460
add is that it's really

03:25:14.460 --> 03:25:16.460
important and it's very

03:25:16.460 --> 03:25:18.460
challenging, especially for those of us

03:25:18.460 --> 03:25:20.460
who are practitioners and educators

03:25:20.460 --> 03:25:22.460
in the field to

03:25:22.460 --> 03:25:24.460
but we need to understand

03:25:24.460 --> 03:25:26.460
that we have to make our determination

03:25:26.460 --> 03:25:28.460
based on if there's

03:25:28.460 --> 03:25:30.460
evidence in the documentary record

03:25:30.460 --> 03:25:32.460
that supports the allegations

03:25:32.460 --> 03:25:34.460
of abuse of discretion.

03:25:34.460 --> 03:25:36.460
We cannot make our decision

03:25:36.460 --> 03:25:38.460
based upon whether we agree

03:25:38.460 --> 03:25:40.460
with the findings or disagree with the

03:25:40.460 --> 03:25:42.460
findings or agree with the action

03:25:42.460 --> 03:25:44.460
or disagree with the action.

03:25:44.460 --> 03:25:46.460
And as I said, I believe that's

03:25:46.460 --> 03:25:48.460
challenging at times for those of us

03:25:48.460 --> 03:25:50.460
who are in the field and can

03:25:50.460 --> 03:25:52.460
bring that lens as well.

03:25:52.460 --> 03:25:54.460
But the decision before

03:25:54.460 --> 03:25:56.460
us requires us to make a

03:25:56.460 --> 03:25:58.460
decision based on if there was an

03:25:58.460 --> 03:26:00.460
abuse of discretion and if that abuse

03:26:00.460 --> 03:26:02.460
of discretion is supported by the

03:26:02.460 --> 03:26:04.460
evidence that's in the documentary record.

03:26:04.460 --> 03:26:06.460
So I'll reserve my additional

03:26:06.460 --> 03:26:08.460
comments and questions for

03:26:08.460 --> 03:26:10.460
our board discussion and I'd like

03:26:10.460 --> 03:26:12.460
to invite

03:26:12.460 --> 03:26:14.460
Member Olken to also provide

03:26:14.460 --> 03:26:16.460
some initial comments before we go

03:26:16.460 --> 03:26:18.460
into discussion.

03:26:18.460 --> 03:26:20.460
Thank you, Vice

03:26:20.460 --> 03:26:22.460
President of Black Clover Woods.

03:26:22.460 --> 03:26:24.460
And I want to start by

03:26:24.460 --> 03:26:26.460
just acknowledging

03:26:26.460 --> 03:26:28.460
the incredible amount of work

03:26:28.460 --> 03:26:30.460
and time and thought

03:26:30.460 --> 03:26:32.460
that has gone into this process

03:26:32.460 --> 03:26:34.460
thus far, from the petitioners

03:26:34.460 --> 03:26:36.460
to the district,

03:26:36.460 --> 03:26:38.460
to the county,

03:26:38.460 --> 03:26:40.460
to the CDE,

03:26:40.460 --> 03:26:42.460
to all the callers.

03:26:44.460 --> 03:26:46.460
As Member Glover Woods

03:26:46.460 --> 03:26:48.460
said, there's clearly strong

03:26:48.460 --> 03:26:50.460
feelings on both sides

03:26:50.460 --> 03:26:52.460
and there's also been a lot of

03:26:52.460 --> 03:26:54.460
thought and

03:26:54.460 --> 03:26:56.460
a lot of care about what

03:26:56.460 --> 03:26:58.460
is best in the best interest

03:26:58.460 --> 03:27:00.460
of students across the state.

03:27:00.460 --> 03:27:02.460
So I just want to start with that and thank everybody who called in.

03:27:04.460 --> 03:27:06.460
It's important

03:27:06.460 --> 03:27:08.460
to hear all those perspectives and I really

03:27:08.460 --> 03:27:10.460
they are

03:27:10.460 --> 03:27:12.460
in my

03:27:12.460 --> 03:27:14.460
they're here in my heart

03:27:14.460 --> 03:27:16.460
on all sides. So thank you.

03:27:16.460 --> 03:27:18.460
I'm just

03:27:18.460 --> 03:27:20.460
going to offer a few

03:27:20.460 --> 03:27:22.460
additional framing thoughts

03:27:22.460 --> 03:27:24.460
before we start our board discussion.

03:27:26.460 --> 03:27:28.460
So as you know, this is only

03:27:28.460 --> 03:27:30.460
the second time that we are hearing

03:27:30.460 --> 03:27:32.460
a charter school

03:27:32.460 --> 03:27:34.460
appeal under

03:27:34.460 --> 03:27:36.460
AB 1505 here

03:27:36.460 --> 03:27:38.460
at the state board. And in fact

03:27:38.460 --> 03:27:40.460
for the petitioners and governing

03:27:40.460 --> 03:27:42.460
bodies along the way,

03:27:42.460 --> 03:27:44.460
they're also working through this process

03:27:44.460 --> 03:27:46.460
for the first time.

03:27:46.460 --> 03:27:48.460
We heard that

03:27:48.460 --> 03:27:50.460
I think

03:27:50.460 --> 03:27:52.460
in both sets of

03:27:52.460 --> 03:27:54.460
presentations. And again,

03:27:54.460 --> 03:27:56.460
I appreciate these are hard.

03:27:56.460 --> 03:27:58.460
This is a hard new process and we're all

03:27:58.460 --> 03:28:00.460
working to do right by it.

03:28:02.460 --> 03:28:04.460
So we have a new role.

03:28:04.460 --> 03:28:06.460
Instead of providing a new

03:28:06.460 --> 03:28:08.460
review of the merits of the proposed

03:28:08.460 --> 03:28:10.460
charter, we are simply

03:28:10.460 --> 03:28:12.460
reviewing the process by which those

03:28:12.460 --> 03:28:14.460
merits were determined.

03:28:14.460 --> 03:28:16.460
And as Member Glover

03:28:16.460 --> 03:28:18.460
Wood said, that may be kind of

03:28:18.460 --> 03:28:20.460
uncomfortable for us.

03:28:20.460 --> 03:28:22.460
But it is the role

03:28:22.460 --> 03:28:24.460
that we have been prescribed by

03:28:24.460 --> 03:28:26.460
law. So some of the questions

03:28:26.460 --> 03:28:28.460
that we need to be asking ourselves

03:28:28.460 --> 03:28:30.460
are, was the

03:28:30.460 --> 03:28:32.460
process fair

03:28:32.460 --> 03:28:34.460
and lawful?

03:28:34.460 --> 03:28:36.460
Was it free from bias?

03:28:36.460 --> 03:28:38.460
And I would add

03:28:38.460 --> 03:28:40.460
just like we must do in making all

03:28:40.460 --> 03:28:42.460
decisions in our roles as educators,

03:28:42.460 --> 03:28:44.460
we're students at the heart

03:28:44.460 --> 03:28:46.460
of the decision making process.

03:28:48.460 --> 03:28:50.460
On that note, one important

03:28:50.460 --> 03:28:52.460
thing I'd like to emphasize

03:28:52.460 --> 03:28:54.460
is that even in this new era

03:28:54.460 --> 03:28:56.460
in which AB 1505

03:28:56.460 --> 03:28:58.460
gives local governing bodies more

03:28:58.460 --> 03:29:00.460
control over the charter

03:29:00.460 --> 03:29:02.460
petition process and

03:29:02.460 --> 03:29:04.460
more legal reasons to deny a petition,

03:29:04.460 --> 03:29:06.460
I want to remind

03:29:06.460 --> 03:29:08.460
us that as we consider this

03:29:08.460 --> 03:29:10.460
item, the assumption in

03:29:10.460 --> 03:29:12.460
law is still that charter

03:29:12.460 --> 03:29:14.460
schools play an important role

03:29:14.460 --> 03:29:16.460
in the public education landscape

03:29:16.460 --> 03:29:18.460
and should be encouraged.

03:29:18.460 --> 03:29:20.460
That's still the basis

03:29:20.460 --> 03:29:22.460
that was not changed by 1505

03:29:22.460 --> 03:29:24.460
and that's still at

03:29:24.460 --> 03:29:26.460
the heart of

03:29:26.460 --> 03:29:28.460
Ed code related to charter schools.

03:29:28.460 --> 03:29:30.460
And I too will, I have

03:29:30.460 --> 03:29:32.460
some further thoughts and questions, but

03:29:32.460 --> 03:29:34.460
I'll save those for just a little bit

03:29:34.460 --> 03:29:36.460
later as

03:29:36.460 --> 03:29:38.460
our discussion proceeds.

03:29:38.460 --> 03:29:40.460
Thank you.

03:29:40.460 --> 03:29:42.460
I'm going to

03:29:42.460 --> 03:29:44.460
also offer a couple

03:29:44.460 --> 03:29:46.460
of thoughts about the framing for

03:29:46.460 --> 03:29:48.460
our discussion and I just want to

03:29:48.460 --> 03:29:50.460
note that board members obviously

03:29:50.460 --> 03:29:52.460
should raise their zoom hands if they want to

03:29:52.460 --> 03:29:54.460
make comments as we get into discussion

03:29:54.460 --> 03:29:56.460
and remind

03:29:56.460 --> 03:29:58.460
the panelists that if a board member has

03:29:58.460 --> 03:30:00.460
a question for you, then you'll be

03:30:00.460 --> 03:30:02.460
recognized and unmuted so that you can

03:30:02.460 --> 03:30:04.460
respond, but please do not

03:30:04.460 --> 03:30:06.460
raise your hand or

03:30:06.460 --> 03:30:08.460
expect to be acknowledged during the board's

03:30:08.460 --> 03:30:10.460
deliberation otherwise,

03:30:10.460 --> 03:30:12.460
unless there's a direct question for

03:30:12.460 --> 03:30:14.460
you.

03:30:14.460 --> 03:30:16.460
I want to just offer a couple

03:30:16.460 --> 03:30:18.460
more thoughts about the

03:30:18.460 --> 03:30:20.460
complex framework

03:30:20.460 --> 03:30:22.460
where we're working in here.

03:30:22.460 --> 03:30:24.460
I want to note that I appreciate

03:30:24.460 --> 03:30:26.460
hearing from members of the community

03:30:26.460 --> 03:30:28.460
and it sounds as

03:30:28.460 --> 03:30:30.460
though the district has developed a strong

03:30:30.460 --> 03:30:32.460
communication to parents

03:30:32.460 --> 03:30:34.460
and members of the community that the programs

03:30:34.460 --> 03:30:36.460
they care about would be threatened

03:30:36.460 --> 03:30:38.460
by the approval of the charter.

03:30:38.460 --> 03:30:40.460
And I'm empathetic with their fearfulness

03:30:40.460 --> 03:30:42.460
that that kind of messaging

03:30:42.460 --> 03:30:44.460
can create. Every parent

03:30:44.460 --> 03:30:46.460
is deeply and appropriately

03:30:46.460 --> 03:30:48.460
concerned about the welfare of their

03:30:48.460 --> 03:30:50.460
child.

03:30:50.460 --> 03:30:52.460
Our job is to look at this

03:30:52.460 --> 03:30:54.460
case in the context of

03:30:54.460 --> 03:30:56.460
setting

03:30:56.460 --> 03:30:58.460
some parameters for how we will

03:30:58.460 --> 03:31:00.460
consider the immediate case and

03:31:00.460 --> 03:31:02.460
cases in the future.

03:31:02.460 --> 03:31:04.460
There are some procedural

03:31:04.460 --> 03:31:06.460
questions about the timing of the appeal

03:31:06.460 --> 03:31:08.460
petition being sent to the county and the

03:31:08.460 --> 03:31:10.460
district and about the availability

03:31:10.460 --> 03:31:12.460
of written findings at the time of

03:31:12.460 --> 03:31:14.460
the vote. Some of those

03:31:14.460 --> 03:31:16.460
questions are troubling.

03:31:16.460 --> 03:31:18.460
The evidence before

03:31:18.460 --> 03:31:20.460
us, as we've heard, can be

03:31:20.460 --> 03:31:22.460
read either way.

03:31:22.460 --> 03:31:24.460
There are also

03:31:24.460 --> 03:31:26.460
questions about the proper

03:31:26.460 --> 03:31:28.460
role of the county and the state

03:31:28.460 --> 03:31:30.460
in reviewing district actions.

03:31:30.460 --> 03:31:32.460
With respect to the

03:31:32.460 --> 03:31:34.460
educational analysis, the county

03:31:34.460 --> 03:31:36.460
statement of findings noted

03:31:36.460 --> 03:31:38.460
they did not agree with the district's

03:31:38.460 --> 03:31:40.460
analysis and the findings

03:31:40.460 --> 03:31:42.460
that the petitioners were demonstrably

03:31:42.460 --> 03:31:44.460
unlikely to successfully implement

03:31:44.460 --> 03:31:46.460
the program.

03:31:46.460 --> 03:31:48.460
In fact, they noted that

03:31:48.460 --> 03:31:50.460
they thought that

03:31:50.460 --> 03:31:52.460
the MCMS

03:31:52.460 --> 03:31:54.460
were providing enrolled students with

03:31:54.460 --> 03:31:56.460
educational benefit in a program

03:31:56.460 --> 03:31:58.460
substantially similar to River

03:31:58.460 --> 03:32:00.460
Middle School, a school that had been

03:32:00.460 --> 03:32:02.460
operating for more than 20 years.

03:32:02.460 --> 03:32:04.460
Within the district was

03:32:04.460 --> 03:32:06.460
being closed this school year

03:32:06.460 --> 03:32:08.460
and

03:32:08.460 --> 03:32:10.460
offered a similar

03:32:10.460 --> 03:32:12.460
program. They later

03:32:12.460 --> 03:32:14.460
noted that

03:32:14.460 --> 03:32:16.460
the

03:32:16.460 --> 03:32:18.460
program that was offered

03:32:18.460 --> 03:32:20.460
has been part of a

03:32:20.460 --> 03:32:22.460
series of programs in the

03:32:22.460 --> 03:32:24.460
New Tech Network founded in

03:32:24.460 --> 03:32:26.460
Napa. These are

03:32:26.460 --> 03:32:28.460
project-based schools.

03:32:28.460 --> 03:32:30.460
So there is an elementary New

03:32:30.460 --> 03:32:32.460
Tech school, a

03:32:32.460 --> 03:32:34.460
New Tech high school,

03:32:34.460 --> 03:32:36.460
and this would be providing a

03:32:36.460 --> 03:32:38.460
middle school.

03:32:38.460 --> 03:32:40.460
Apparently the

03:32:40.460 --> 03:32:42.460
district had

03:32:42.460 --> 03:32:44.460
closed River Middle School

03:32:44.460 --> 03:32:46.460
charter school

03:32:46.460 --> 03:32:48.460
on the condition that it would

03:32:48.460 --> 03:32:50.460
continue to be operated by the district

03:32:50.460 --> 03:32:52.460
using that model of instruction

03:32:52.460 --> 03:32:54.460
and the transition was

03:32:54.460 --> 03:32:56.460
effective for one year, 2019-20,

03:32:56.460 --> 03:32:58.460
and then the

03:32:58.460 --> 03:33:00.460
River Middle School was closed,

03:33:00.460 --> 03:33:02.460
had a full enrollment

03:33:02.460 --> 03:33:04.460
with a waitlist every year, consistently

03:33:04.460 --> 03:33:06.460
strong academic performance.

03:33:06.460 --> 03:33:08.460
So the county

03:33:08.460 --> 03:33:10.460
sort of both

03:33:10.460 --> 03:33:12.460
laid out for multiple paragraphs

03:33:12.460 --> 03:33:14.460
what they thought were the virtues

03:33:14.460 --> 03:33:16.460
of the petition and

03:33:16.460 --> 03:33:18.460
their reasons for approving it educationally

03:33:18.460 --> 03:33:20.460
and noted that

03:33:20.460 --> 03:33:22.460
it was

03:33:22.460 --> 03:33:24.460
potentially still showing a particular need

03:33:24.460 --> 03:33:26.460
in that particular district

03:33:26.460 --> 03:33:28.460
given the history of the district.

03:33:28.460 --> 03:33:30.460
So the sole basis for the

03:33:30.460 --> 03:33:32.460
county's denial was

03:33:32.460 --> 03:33:34.460
a fiscal impact

03:33:34.460 --> 03:33:36.460
statement and one of our questions for

03:33:36.460 --> 03:33:38.460
us is what constitutes an

03:33:38.460 --> 03:33:40.460
appropriate showing of

03:33:40.460 --> 03:33:42.460
fiscal impact.

03:33:42.460 --> 03:33:44.460
This is a different

03:33:44.460 --> 03:33:46.460
basis than what

03:33:46.460 --> 03:33:48.460
we were talking about

03:33:48.460 --> 03:33:50.460
yesterday. The

03:33:50.460 --> 03:33:52.460
fiscal impact basis

03:33:52.460 --> 03:33:54.460
is under a different criterion of

03:33:54.460 --> 03:33:56.460
the law, not the one about

03:33:56.460 --> 03:33:58.460
receivership and fiscal distress,

03:33:58.460 --> 03:34:00.460
but a criterion that requires a finding

03:34:00.460 --> 03:34:02.460
that the charter school is demonstrably

03:34:02.460 --> 03:34:04.460
unlikely to serve the interests of the

03:34:04.460 --> 03:34:06.460
entire community in which the school

03:34:06.460 --> 03:34:08.460
is proposing to locate. And you heard that

03:34:08.460 --> 03:34:10.460
language in many of the comments.

03:34:10.460 --> 03:34:12.460
Analysis

03:34:12.460 --> 03:34:14.460
shall include consideration

03:34:14.460 --> 03:34:16.460
of the fiscal impact of the proposed

03:34:16.460 --> 03:34:18.460
charter school and detail specific

03:34:18.460 --> 03:34:20.460
facts and circumstances that

03:34:20.460 --> 03:34:22.460
analyze and consider

03:34:22.460 --> 03:34:24.460
the following factors including the extent

03:34:24.460 --> 03:34:26.460
to which the proposed charter would

03:34:26.460 --> 03:34:28.460
substantially undermine existing services

03:34:28.460 --> 03:34:30.460
academic offerings or program

03:34:30.460 --> 03:34:32.460
offerings.

03:34:32.460 --> 03:34:34.460
And this is

03:34:34.460 --> 03:34:36.460
going to be a challenging

03:34:38.460 --> 03:34:40.460
framework for

03:34:40.460 --> 03:34:42.460
other districts as well as the

03:34:42.460 --> 03:34:44.460
one that we're considering. Because

03:34:44.460 --> 03:34:46.460
of course no single school

03:34:46.460 --> 03:34:48.460
charter or otherwise

03:34:48.460 --> 03:34:50.460
does serve all the

03:34:50.460 --> 03:34:52.460
children in the community.

03:34:52.460 --> 03:34:54.460
So a literal translation

03:34:54.460 --> 03:34:56.460
of the interests of the entire

03:34:56.460 --> 03:34:58.460
community could lead to the denial

03:34:58.460 --> 03:35:00.460
of all charters. And of

03:35:00.460 --> 03:35:02.460
course any charter school will have

03:35:02.460 --> 03:35:04.460
an impact on the district

03:35:04.460 --> 03:35:06.460
fiscal situation

03:35:06.460 --> 03:35:08.460
and loss of ADA as district

03:35:08.460 --> 03:35:10.460
students enroll in the new charter

03:35:10.460 --> 03:35:12.460
school. So one question we have

03:35:12.460 --> 03:35:14.460
is what should the standard be?

03:35:14.460 --> 03:35:16.460
The analysis is based on the

03:35:16.460 --> 03:35:18.460
fact of ongoing decline in enrollment

03:35:18.460 --> 03:35:20.460
in the district, about which

03:35:20.460 --> 03:35:22.460
there was data presented at the time

03:35:22.460 --> 03:35:24.460
before meeting. And this goes to the

03:35:24.460 --> 03:35:26.460
question of were there written findings

03:35:26.460 --> 03:35:28.460
of fact? The decline

03:35:28.460 --> 03:35:30.460
was suggested that it would likely

03:35:30.460 --> 03:35:32.460
require reduction in staff being

03:35:32.460 --> 03:35:34.460
accelerated by the loss of students

03:35:34.460 --> 03:35:36.460
going to the charter school.

03:35:36.460 --> 03:35:38.460
However, I would note that that would be

03:35:38.460 --> 03:35:40.460
the case in any district or school with declining

03:35:40.460 --> 03:35:42.460
enrollment that maintains a

03:35:42.460 --> 03:35:44.460
constant ratio between the number of

03:35:44.460 --> 03:35:46.460
students and staff. Depending on how

03:35:46.460 --> 03:35:48.460
the shift is managed, it may

03:35:48.460 --> 03:35:50.460
or may not undermine the services offered

03:35:50.460 --> 03:35:52.460
to students, which is

03:35:52.460 --> 03:35:54.460
by the status specific finding

03:35:54.460 --> 03:35:56.460
and evidence that the new charter

03:35:56.460 --> 03:35:58.460
must substantially undermine district

03:35:58.460 --> 03:36:00.460
services and offerings.

03:36:00.460 --> 03:36:02.460
That did not really occur

03:36:02.460 --> 03:36:04.460
in that way at the

03:36:04.460 --> 03:36:06.460
Sunday board meeting.

03:36:06.460 --> 03:36:08.460
At the same time, the findings document

03:36:08.460 --> 03:36:10.460
noted that there were other factors that could

03:36:10.460 --> 03:36:12.460
change assumptions about the teacher budget.

03:36:12.460 --> 03:36:14.460
On the one hand, there were

03:36:14.460 --> 03:36:16.460
the questions about the enrollment of

03:36:16.460 --> 03:36:18.460
the current students, some

03:36:18.460 --> 03:36:20.460
of whose parents had stated they'd leave

03:36:20.460 --> 03:36:22.460
the district. But on the

03:36:22.460 --> 03:36:24.460
other hand, the projected increase in enrollment

03:36:24.460 --> 03:36:26.460
due to TK students and estimated

03:36:26.460 --> 03:36:28.460
416 new students

03:36:28.460 --> 03:36:30.460
by 2025-26

03:36:30.460 --> 03:36:32.460
would more than offset the potentially

03:36:32.460 --> 03:36:34.460
300 and some students

03:36:34.460 --> 03:36:36.460
who might ultimately attend

03:36:36.460 --> 03:36:38.460
the middle school. And at a

03:36:38.460 --> 03:36:40.460
time when the state has increased

03:36:40.460 --> 03:36:42.460
allocations to education,

03:36:42.460 --> 03:36:44.460
including in the LCFS

03:36:44.460 --> 03:36:46.460
formula, funding for TK,

03:36:46.460 --> 03:36:48.460
after school summer programs and meals,

03:36:48.460 --> 03:36:50.460
there aren't many new

03:36:50.460 --> 03:36:52.460
factors that are shaping budgeting

03:36:52.460 --> 03:36:54.460
decisions for districts. So it's

03:36:54.460 --> 03:36:56.460
clear that a mere finding of potential

03:36:56.460 --> 03:36:58.460
fiscal impact of declining enrollment

03:36:58.460 --> 03:37:00.460
is not enough

03:37:00.460 --> 03:37:02.460
to establish that a proposed

03:37:02.460 --> 03:37:04.460
charter school does not serve the interests of

03:37:04.460 --> 03:37:06.460
the whole community. So I think

03:37:06.460 --> 03:37:08.460
these are questions that we're going to need to

03:37:08.460 --> 03:37:10.460
work our way through.

03:37:14.460 --> 03:37:16.460
There's also the question that

03:37:16.460 --> 03:37:18.460
even though the documentary records

03:37:18.460 --> 03:37:20.460
from the county notes that the district

03:37:20.460 --> 03:37:22.460
broke a promise to their parents and made

03:37:22.460 --> 03:37:24.460
decisions that the county questioned,

03:37:24.460 --> 03:37:26.460
including not locating

03:37:26.460 --> 03:37:28.460
the school where there was room for

03:37:28.460 --> 03:37:30.460
such a school and

03:37:30.460 --> 03:37:32.460
another building.

03:37:32.460 --> 03:37:34.460
The law specifies that the county's

03:37:34.460 --> 03:37:36.460
review is independent and

03:37:36.460 --> 03:37:38.460
de novo, and it is not a review

03:37:38.460 --> 03:37:40.460
of the district's process of finding.

03:37:42.460 --> 03:37:44.460
The county board

03:37:44.460 --> 03:37:46.460
is instructed accordingly

03:37:46.460 --> 03:37:48.460
that it should not take

03:37:48.460 --> 03:37:50.460
underdetermined whether the district

03:37:50.460 --> 03:37:52.460
findings were correct, whether petitioners

03:37:52.460 --> 03:37:54.460
were treated fairly, and so on.

03:37:54.460 --> 03:37:56.460
And a critical issue

03:37:56.460 --> 03:37:58.460
then is that the county cannot make this

03:37:58.460 --> 03:38:00.460
determination. Where does that determination

03:38:00.460 --> 03:38:02.460
lie? And in fact,

03:38:02.460 --> 03:38:04.460
it may lie with us.

03:38:04.460 --> 03:38:06.460
So I think we

03:38:06.460 --> 03:38:08.460
I want to open the discussion at this

03:38:08.460 --> 03:38:10.460
point, but simply note

03:38:10.460 --> 03:38:12.460
that there are different

03:38:12.460 --> 03:38:14.460
framings on which one might

03:38:14.460 --> 03:38:16.460
tackle this question

03:38:16.460 --> 03:38:18.460
of whether it was an abuse of discretion

03:38:20.460 --> 03:38:22.460
at either level of the

03:38:22.460 --> 03:38:24.460
process.

03:38:24.460 --> 03:38:26.460
And let's see who wants to launch

03:38:26.460 --> 03:38:28.460
us into discussion.

03:38:28.460 --> 03:38:30.460
We'll start with

03:38:30.460 --> 03:38:32.460
member

03:38:32.460 --> 03:38:34.460
Orozco Gonzalez.

03:38:36.460 --> 03:38:38.460
Thank you again for such a

03:38:38.460 --> 03:38:40.460
thorough presentation

03:38:40.460 --> 03:38:42.460
and for all the public comments.

03:38:42.460 --> 03:38:44.460
I think they were very informative

03:38:44.460 --> 03:38:46.460
in understanding the whole

03:38:46.460 --> 03:38:48.460
aspect in the entire picture.

03:38:48.460 --> 03:38:50.460
I just have a question in regards

03:38:50.460 --> 03:38:52.460
to maybe to the Napa County

03:38:52.460 --> 03:38:54.460
Attorney

03:38:54.460 --> 03:38:56.460
about the procedural aspect.

03:38:56.460 --> 03:38:58.460
On page seven and eight of the item,

03:38:58.460 --> 03:39:00.460
the education code section

03:39:00.460 --> 03:39:02.460
47605K

03:39:02.460 --> 03:39:04.460
allows a charter school

03:39:04.460 --> 03:39:06.460
petition to appeal to the county within

03:39:06.460 --> 03:39:08.460
30 days and requires

03:39:08.460 --> 03:39:10.460
that appeal to be copied to the district

03:39:10.460 --> 03:39:12.460
at the same time. My understanding

03:39:12.460 --> 03:39:14.460
is that the Maya Commons charter did

03:39:14.460 --> 03:39:16.460
not follow the requirements of the education

03:39:16.460 --> 03:39:18.460
code initially

03:39:18.460 --> 03:39:20.460
because they failed to copy the school district

03:39:20.460 --> 03:39:22.460
which delayed the start of the

03:39:22.460 --> 03:39:24.460
90 day timeline

03:39:24.460 --> 03:39:26.460
for the county to make a decision.

03:39:26.460 --> 03:39:28.460
Am I understanding that correctly?

03:39:28.460 --> 03:39:30.460
I'm asking for clarity.

03:39:30.460 --> 03:39:32.460
Yes, you are understanding

03:39:32.460 --> 03:39:34.460
that correctly. The appeal

03:39:34.460 --> 03:39:36.460
was submitted directly to the

03:39:36.460 --> 03:39:38.460
county superintendent of schools

03:39:38.460 --> 03:39:40.460
and the school district

03:39:40.460 --> 03:39:42.460
was not copied on that appeal.

03:39:42.460 --> 03:39:44.460
The county superintendent of schools

03:39:44.460 --> 03:39:46.460
after conferring with me

03:39:46.460 --> 03:39:48.460
told petitioners that they needed

03:39:48.460 --> 03:39:50.460
to submit that to

03:39:50.460 --> 03:39:52.460
the school district as well.

03:39:52.460 --> 03:39:54.460
The school district was particularly

03:39:54.460 --> 03:39:56.460
concerned here that some items

03:39:56.460 --> 03:39:58.460
had changed within the petition

03:39:58.460 --> 03:40:00.460
that would require remand

03:40:00.460 --> 03:40:02.460
and so we did make them submit

03:40:02.460 --> 03:40:04.460
the entire appeal packet

03:40:04.460 --> 03:40:06.460
to the school district so that

03:40:06.460 --> 03:40:08.460
the school district could review it and

03:40:08.460 --> 03:40:10.460
ensure that items had not changed

03:40:10.460 --> 03:40:12.460
and that there was no need for remand.

03:40:12.460 --> 03:40:14.460
Okay, thank you.

03:40:14.460 --> 03:40:16.460
Next we have a member

03:40:16.460 --> 03:40:18.460
for the work.

03:40:20.460 --> 03:40:22.460
Thank you.

03:40:22.460 --> 03:40:24.460
I had a question

03:40:24.460 --> 03:40:26.460
regarding the written

03:40:26.460 --> 03:40:28.460
findings that were adopted

03:40:28.460 --> 03:40:30.460
by the county board

03:40:30.460 --> 03:40:32.460
and I believe

03:40:32.460 --> 03:40:34.460
I'm going to

03:40:34.460 --> 03:40:36.460
first address the question

03:40:36.460 --> 03:40:38.460
to Stephanie Farland if she's still

03:40:38.460 --> 03:40:40.460
on with us.

03:40:40.460 --> 03:40:42.460
Okay.

03:40:42.460 --> 03:40:44.460
I will start with

03:40:44.460 --> 03:40:46.460
Director Farland.

03:40:46.460 --> 03:40:48.460
So were the

03:40:48.460 --> 03:40:50.460
written findings

03:40:50.460 --> 03:40:52.460
that were adopted

03:40:52.460 --> 03:40:54.460
or ratified on April 5

03:40:54.460 --> 03:40:56.460
reflective

03:40:56.460 --> 03:40:58.460
of

03:40:58.460 --> 03:41:00.460
comments or statements

03:41:00.460 --> 03:41:02.460
within the staff report

03:41:02.460 --> 03:41:04.460
and or discussion that took place

03:41:04.460 --> 03:41:06.460
at the board meeting

03:41:06.460 --> 03:41:08.460
on March 15th?

03:41:08.460 --> 03:41:10.460
Okay.

03:41:10.460 --> 03:41:12.460
Thank you

03:41:12.460 --> 03:41:14.460
member Leverwoods.

03:41:14.460 --> 03:41:16.460
Yes, they

03:41:16.460 --> 03:41:18.460
were.

03:41:18.460 --> 03:41:20.460
So

03:41:20.460 --> 03:41:22.460
there were

03:41:22.460 --> 03:41:24.460
and I believe

03:41:24.460 --> 03:41:26.460
the

03:41:26.460 --> 03:41:28.460
county mentioned this as

03:41:28.460 --> 03:41:30.460
well.

03:41:30.460 --> 03:41:32.460
They had 26

03:41:32.460 --> 03:41:34.460
sort of numbered findings within

03:41:34.460 --> 03:41:36.460
their resolution

03:41:36.460 --> 03:41:38.460
to deny that they ratified.

03:41:38.460 --> 03:41:40.460
I would say

03:41:40.460 --> 03:41:42.460
that

03:41:42.460 --> 03:41:44.460
20 out of

03:41:44.460 --> 03:41:46.460
21 of those

03:41:46.460 --> 03:41:48.460
the first

03:41:48.460 --> 03:41:50.460
few statements were introductory

03:41:50.460 --> 03:41:52.460
but 20 out of the 20 remaining

03:41:52.460 --> 03:41:54.460
21 statements were present

03:41:54.460 --> 03:41:56.460
either in the staff report

03:41:56.460 --> 03:41:58.460
the county staff report

03:41:58.460 --> 03:42:00.460
or part of the board discussion

03:42:00.460 --> 03:42:02.460
at the board meeting.

03:42:02.460 --> 03:42:04.460
So the findings

03:42:04.460 --> 03:42:06.460
that the county ratified

03:42:06.460 --> 03:42:08.460
the 26 findings

03:42:08.460 --> 03:42:10.460
were not

03:42:10.460 --> 03:42:12.460
a surprise. They were actually

03:42:12.460 --> 03:42:14.460
discussed at the board meeting

03:42:14.460 --> 03:42:16.460
at the county or they were

03:42:16.460 --> 03:42:18.460
in the staff report.

03:42:18.460 --> 03:42:20.460
I'd also

03:42:20.460 --> 03:42:22.460
like to say that that staff report

03:42:22.460 --> 03:42:24.460
is just that it's the staff report

03:42:24.460 --> 03:42:26.460
that was posted

03:42:26.460 --> 03:42:28.460
15 days prior to the decision meeting.

03:42:28.460 --> 03:42:30.460
It's required by law now.

03:42:30.460 --> 03:42:32.460
That staff report is not required

03:42:32.460 --> 03:42:34.460
to be adopted by the board just as our

03:42:34.460 --> 03:42:36.460
staff reports aren't required to be adopted by you.

03:42:36.460 --> 03:42:38.460
So

03:42:38.460 --> 03:42:40.460
just to make that clarification

03:42:40.460 --> 03:42:42.460
as well. But yes, the findings

03:42:42.460 --> 03:42:44.460
were findings that were just

03:42:44.460 --> 03:42:46.460
either discussed, came from the staff report

03:42:46.460 --> 03:42:48.460
or also came

03:42:48.460 --> 03:42:50.460
from the discussion

03:42:50.460 --> 03:42:52.460
at the county board meeting.

03:42:56.460 --> 03:42:58.460
I hope that answers your question.

03:43:00.460 --> 03:43:02.460
Yes, it does. Thank you.

03:43:04.460 --> 03:43:06.460
Thank you.

03:43:12.460 --> 03:43:14.460
Apologies, President Dilan.

03:43:14.460 --> 03:43:16.460
I believe you're on mute.

03:43:18.460 --> 03:43:20.460
Thank you.

03:43:20.460 --> 03:43:22.460
Member Yashimo Ototari.

03:43:22.460 --> 03:43:24.460
And then member Escobedo.

03:43:24.460 --> 03:43:26.460
Thank you.

03:43:26.460 --> 03:43:28.460
And I also want to thank everyone for your presentations

03:43:28.460 --> 03:43:30.460
today and all the public comments.

03:43:30.460 --> 03:43:32.460
Thank you, Board President for your

03:43:32.460 --> 03:43:37.460
very thorough summarization of all of the different issues.

03:43:38.940 --> 03:43:42.340
I have a question because as we're charged

03:43:42.340 --> 03:43:46.340
with determining whether there was abusive discretion,

03:43:46.340 --> 03:43:49.900
I think the order of operations is important

03:43:49.900 --> 03:43:54.380
and it can open the door to the perception of such,

03:43:54.380 --> 03:43:59.340
whether or not it was actually an abusive discretion or not,

03:43:59.340 --> 03:44:01.660
it could cause the perception of such.

03:44:01.660 --> 03:44:06.500
So I think this is a question for either County Council

03:44:06.500 --> 03:44:08.820
or possibly Director Farland.

03:44:09.900 --> 03:44:13.900
My question is, could the County Office Board of Ed

03:44:13.900 --> 03:44:18.260
change their March 15th vote to deny the appeal

03:44:19.340 --> 03:44:24.340
if it was found later that there weren't sufficient findings

03:44:26.160 --> 03:44:27.860
when they were bringing the findings forward

03:44:27.860 --> 03:44:30.160
on April 5th for ratification?

03:44:31.160 --> 03:44:32.760
Could there have been a change

03:44:32.760 --> 03:44:36.000
to the initial decision on March 15th?

03:44:37.440 --> 03:44:40.740
I'm gonna allow the County's attorney to answer that.

03:44:41.680 --> 03:44:43.560
Thank you, Director Farland.

03:44:43.560 --> 03:44:46.160
That question was never put to me by my client

03:44:46.160 --> 03:44:48.300
and so I did not research that question.

03:44:48.300 --> 03:44:50.480
If they had asked at that time

03:44:50.480 --> 03:44:52.560
whether or not they could change their decision,

03:44:52.560 --> 03:44:54.320
I would have looked into that,

03:44:54.320 --> 03:44:57.480
but that was not requested by the County Board.

03:44:57.560 --> 03:45:01.040
And I just want to ask if Mr. Schultz has anything else

03:45:01.040 --> 03:45:03.480
to add because he was at that board meeting.

03:45:06.840 --> 03:45:09.600
Yeah, I mean, the only thing I would add is that,

03:45:09.600 --> 03:45:12.280
when the final decision came down,

03:45:12.280 --> 03:45:13.520
there was a five to two vote.

03:45:13.520 --> 03:45:15.120
There was a split on the board

03:45:15.120 --> 03:45:16.520
and there were those that were in favor

03:45:16.520 --> 03:45:17.480
of granting the charter,

03:45:17.480 --> 03:45:21.720
but ultimately the majority of the board found

03:45:21.720 --> 03:45:25.760
that the community impact was significant enough

03:45:25.760 --> 03:45:29.560
that it met that criteria for denying the appeal.

03:45:29.560 --> 03:45:34.360
And respectfully to President Darling-Hammond's comments,

03:45:34.360 --> 03:45:36.360
all of these criteria require judgment.

03:45:36.360 --> 03:45:39.600
And as you know, the district had findings

03:45:39.600 --> 03:45:42.960
that our staff report did not agree with,

03:45:42.960 --> 03:45:45.120
but we did have one particular finding

03:45:45.120 --> 03:45:47.160
that we thought the County Board should consider

03:45:47.160 --> 03:45:49.200
and that was community impact.

03:45:49.200 --> 03:45:52.840
And you can argue about whether it was material enough

03:45:52.840 --> 03:45:54.160
to deny or not,

03:45:54.160 --> 03:45:56.200
but that was for the County Board to judge, I think,

03:45:56.200 --> 03:45:58.240
and not for the State Board of Education

03:45:58.240 --> 03:45:59.600
to supersede that judgment.

03:46:00.640 --> 03:46:04.400
There's a slide in the documentary record.

03:46:05.440 --> 03:46:09.200
I think it's page 1,422

03:46:09.200 --> 03:46:11.240
of the County Board's documentary record.

03:46:11.240 --> 03:46:13.360
It's a presentation from FICMAT and School Services

03:46:13.360 --> 03:46:15.520
about the impact of declining enrollment

03:46:15.520 --> 03:46:17.200
and you can't cut fast enough, deal with it,

03:46:17.200 --> 03:46:19.400
unless you do things like close schools

03:46:19.400 --> 03:46:21.840
and adding additional declining enrollment

03:46:21.840 --> 03:46:24.120
to a district that's already declining rapidly

03:46:25.080 --> 03:46:26.160
and that's based on Department of Finance numbers,

03:46:26.160 --> 03:46:30.440
not on local projections, does have an impact.

03:46:30.440 --> 03:46:32.000
It means you're gonna have to cut programs

03:46:32.000 --> 03:46:34.800
beyond the staff you can cut just because you lose students

03:46:34.800 --> 03:46:37.240
and that's what the County Board ultimately decided.

03:46:38.960 --> 03:46:39.800
Thank you.

03:46:44.200 --> 03:46:45.800
President Darling-Hammond, I apologize.

03:46:45.800 --> 03:46:47.160
I believe mute's still on.

03:46:48.440 --> 03:46:51.320
I'm sorry, I'm trying not to make noise in the meantime.

03:46:52.320 --> 03:46:56.480
Okay, member Escobedo and then we'll call the words.

03:46:56.480 --> 03:46:58.040
Let me just say to the question

03:46:58.040 --> 03:47:00.800
about how we evaluate fiscal impact.

03:47:01.800 --> 03:47:06.800
There really is a, we need the entire evidentiary record

03:47:08.840 --> 03:47:13.720
to be having this conversation in front of us

03:47:13.720 --> 03:47:17.000
because if there were a finding

03:47:17.000 --> 03:47:20.280
that having declining enrollment in and of itself,

03:47:20.320 --> 03:47:23.760
even when it might be offset by increases in enrollment

03:47:23.760 --> 03:47:26.840
for other reasons, that that is enough to deny a charter

03:47:26.840 --> 03:47:31.480
would have substantial ripple effects

03:47:31.480 --> 03:47:34.280
across the decision-making process.

03:47:34.280 --> 03:47:36.640
Member Escobedo and then we'll call the words.

03:47:38.720 --> 03:47:42.760
Yes, in the same line of the fiscal impact,

03:47:42.760 --> 03:47:47.760
there were just so many items under the district analysis

03:47:47.880 --> 03:47:52.880
where there was a cash flow issue

03:47:52.880 --> 03:47:56.160
that excluded lease and utility expenses,

03:47:56.160 --> 03:47:59.240
which made the charter have a negative,

03:48:00.080 --> 03:48:03.200
I believe cash balance.

03:48:03.200 --> 03:48:07.200
And then I see that the charter written submission

03:48:07.200 --> 03:48:09.800
did not contain specific citations.

03:48:09.800 --> 03:48:14.800
I mean, I see that really throughout the chart

03:48:14.920 --> 03:48:18.160
that was provided under the whole fiscal,

03:48:18.160 --> 03:48:20.520
financial and operation plan.

03:48:20.520 --> 03:48:22.120
And I'm just curious.

03:48:22.120 --> 03:48:25.000
I don't know if it's the charters

03:48:27.000 --> 03:48:29.920
not understanding the district's facts,

03:48:29.920 --> 03:48:32.920
but I'm just curious to the process

03:48:32.920 --> 03:48:37.920
between the county and charters, is there like,

03:48:41.160 --> 03:48:44.680
and I do understand that the burden of proof

03:48:45.560 --> 03:48:49.240
is on the charter, but is there any explanation

03:48:49.240 --> 03:48:54.240
to the charters understanding that they have to provide

03:48:54.680 --> 03:48:59.680
specific citations to the documentary record

03:49:02.160 --> 03:49:03.200
from the district?

03:49:03.200 --> 03:49:07.520
I'm just really curious how that whole process occurs.

03:49:09.640 --> 03:49:11.560
Is that a question you want to direct

03:49:11.560 --> 03:49:14.040
to the charter petitioners?

03:49:14.880 --> 03:49:18.880
I guess to both from the charter as well as the district.

03:49:21.040 --> 03:49:24.040
So if we can ask the petitioners to respond.

03:49:30.560 --> 03:49:32.280
This is John Lennel.

03:49:32.280 --> 03:49:33.680
I can respond to that.

03:49:33.680 --> 03:49:37.400
This is a new process, Director Escobedo.

03:49:37.400 --> 03:49:39.120
It's very cumbersome.

03:49:39.120 --> 03:49:42.520
As you can see, there are thousands of pages of materials

03:49:42.520 --> 03:49:43.760
that we have to look at and review.

03:49:43.760 --> 03:49:46.960
But we have a very tight window to do it.

03:49:46.960 --> 03:49:48.480
So we have to request it.

03:49:48.480 --> 03:49:50.320
Then we have to wait to get it.

03:49:50.320 --> 03:49:53.080
Now, the statement that we didn't provide citations

03:49:53.080 --> 03:49:55.800
is false, patently false.

03:49:55.800 --> 03:49:56.960
And you can just look at the record

03:49:56.960 --> 03:49:58.480
and see at the end of our letter,

03:49:58.480 --> 03:50:02.520
we have numerous end note citations to the record,

03:50:02.520 --> 03:50:03.360
tons of them.

03:50:04.400 --> 03:50:07.800
The confusion I think is the state created a form

03:50:07.800 --> 03:50:10.520
earlier this year, CD created a form

03:50:10.520 --> 03:50:12.760
that they wanted petitioners to use,

03:50:12.760 --> 03:50:15.760
but it didn't make any sense to use that form in our context

03:50:15.760 --> 03:50:19.080
because part of our problem is the absence

03:50:19.080 --> 03:50:20.360
of citations to the record.

03:50:20.360 --> 03:50:23.400
It's the absence of things that occurred,

03:50:23.400 --> 03:50:26.760
at least for the county, for what the county did.

03:50:26.760 --> 03:50:29.000
I think there's abundant citations

03:50:29.000 --> 03:50:30.000
with regard to the district.

03:50:30.000 --> 03:50:33.320
Our focus here is mostly on the county's failure

03:50:33.320 --> 03:50:35.560
to proceed in a manner required by law.

03:50:35.560 --> 03:50:37.440
It is not possible.

03:50:37.440 --> 03:50:39.640
Look, I litigate for a living.

03:50:40.200 --> 03:50:44.080
And when I do petitions for rights of mandate to courts,

03:50:44.080 --> 03:50:47.800
I have months to peruse and go through the record

03:50:47.800 --> 03:50:49.760
and cite to a record of this size.

03:50:49.760 --> 03:50:51.160
It's crazy.

03:50:51.160 --> 03:50:53.480
I realize this is what the law gives us.

03:50:53.480 --> 03:50:55.120
We're stuck with it.

03:50:55.120 --> 03:50:56.240
The district is stuck with it.

03:50:56.240 --> 03:50:58.280
The county's stuck with it, and now you're stuck with it.

03:50:58.280 --> 03:50:59.600
But it's very difficult to do.

03:50:59.600 --> 03:51:01.160
So we cited to as much as we could

03:51:01.160 --> 03:51:03.160
and only could cite to the big stuff

03:51:03.160 --> 03:51:05.160
because it didn't make a lot of sense

03:51:05.160 --> 03:51:06.560
for us to delve into the little stuff

03:51:06.560 --> 03:51:08.200
if we weren't gonna prevail on the big stuff.

03:51:08.200 --> 03:51:10.840
So that's why we have the end note citations

03:51:10.840 --> 03:51:12.360
at the end of our summary,

03:51:12.360 --> 03:51:14.160
which is what the statute requires,

03:51:15.320 --> 03:51:16.800
to the documentary record.

03:51:18.560 --> 03:51:19.400
Thank you.

03:51:22.480 --> 03:51:23.680
Member Glover-Woods.

03:51:25.000 --> 03:51:25.880
Thank you.

03:51:25.880 --> 03:51:27.960
My question is also for the petitioners.

03:51:27.960 --> 03:51:29.280
I don't know if it would be their attorney

03:51:29.280 --> 03:51:32.600
or the petitioners who presented.

03:51:32.600 --> 03:51:37.400
I just wanted to get clarification on the difference

03:51:37.440 --> 03:51:40.240
in the documents, if there were differences

03:51:41.160 --> 03:51:44.000
in regards to what was submitted to the county office

03:51:44.000 --> 03:51:47.640
on, I believe it was December 21st,

03:51:47.640 --> 03:51:50.960
and what was submitted to the district

03:51:53.120 --> 03:51:55.560
after that, and then the documents

03:51:55.560 --> 03:51:56.960
that were submitted on January 5th.

03:51:56.960 --> 03:52:00.320
So I'm trying to discern if there were differences

03:52:00.320 --> 03:52:02.080
in the actual documents,

03:52:02.080 --> 03:52:03.880
and if so, what those differences are.

03:52:08.360 --> 03:52:12.160
So I can respond to that.

03:52:12.160 --> 03:52:13.760
I can respond to that.

03:52:13.760 --> 03:52:18.360
So there was no difference to the petition.

03:52:18.360 --> 03:52:19.640
The petition is the issue.

03:52:19.640 --> 03:52:21.600
The statute requires that the petition,

03:52:21.600 --> 03:52:23.440
that the actual charter petition

03:52:23.440 --> 03:52:26.920
that's presented to the county on appeal

03:52:26.920 --> 03:52:30.120
be presented at the same time to the district.

03:52:31.160 --> 03:52:32.480
My comments did not do that.

03:52:32.480 --> 03:52:34.680
We inadvertently did not attach the,

03:52:34.680 --> 03:52:37.800
we didn't copy the district.

03:52:37.800 --> 03:52:40.280
So we provided it on the 31st of December.

03:52:41.720 --> 03:52:43.880
The petition that was submitted to the district

03:52:43.880 --> 03:52:45.880
is exactly the same petition that they processed.

03:52:45.880 --> 03:52:49.520
In fact, we pulled the petition from the district's website.

03:52:49.520 --> 03:52:51.920
So we actually pulled the version of the petition

03:52:51.920 --> 03:52:55.440
that they had posted on their website as the petition.

03:52:55.440 --> 03:52:57.120
There is no difference in it.

03:52:57.120 --> 03:52:59.000
The district still though claim

03:52:59.000 --> 03:53:00.560
that they thought there was something different.

03:53:00.560 --> 03:53:02.760
They thought that we added additional signatures

03:53:02.760 --> 03:53:04.600
to the petition, which did not occur.

03:53:05.520 --> 03:53:06.440
So for the benefit of doubt,

03:53:06.440 --> 03:53:09.680
what we did was we copied the district

03:53:09.680 --> 03:53:13.880
and the county on January 5th of the entire appeal packet

03:53:14.920 --> 03:53:17.680
as a courtesy and to clear up the whole situation.

03:53:17.680 --> 03:53:19.360
But the petition itself,

03:53:19.360 --> 03:53:20.760
which is what's required by law

03:53:20.760 --> 03:53:23.880
to be provided to the district was without doubt,

03:53:23.880 --> 03:53:25.280
it's actually in their briefs,

03:53:25.280 --> 03:53:27.920
was provided on December 31st.

03:53:27.920 --> 03:53:29.680
There's no contest about that.

03:53:31.160 --> 03:53:32.840
Okay, so just a quick follow up question.

03:53:32.840 --> 03:53:35.640
Thank you so much for that clarification.

03:53:35.640 --> 03:53:39.520
So the petition itself was given to both the county office

03:53:39.520 --> 03:53:44.520
and the district, let's say by December 31st,

03:53:44.640 --> 03:53:46.800
there was no change to the original petition

03:53:46.800 --> 03:53:48.640
that went to the district

03:53:48.640 --> 03:53:53.560
when they had their particular decision.

03:53:53.560 --> 03:53:55.920
And then on January 5th,

03:53:55.920 --> 03:53:58.120
additional supporting documentation

03:53:58.120 --> 03:54:00.160
was submitted along with the petition.

03:54:01.000 --> 03:54:02.920
Is that correct?

03:54:02.920 --> 03:54:04.120
Not quite.

03:54:04.120 --> 03:54:07.840
So what happened was on December 21st,

03:54:07.840 --> 03:54:09.600
there's an enormous packet of materials

03:54:09.600 --> 03:54:13.160
that was given to the county for our appeal.

03:54:13.160 --> 03:54:14.760
That's the appeal packet.

03:54:14.760 --> 03:54:15.840
So it's required by the statute.

03:54:15.840 --> 03:54:17.120
So it's the petition itself,

03:54:17.120 --> 03:54:20.200
which we pulled down from the district website

03:54:20.200 --> 03:54:23.840
and our opposition to the district's action,

03:54:23.840 --> 03:54:26.040
the district's findings to deny the charter,

03:54:26.040 --> 03:54:27.960
the things that you need to have for a petition.

03:54:28.040 --> 03:54:31.000
That was provided to the county on December 21st.

03:54:32.800 --> 03:54:35.800
Later that week, remember this is the holiday period too.

03:54:35.800 --> 03:54:38.560
Later that week, the district contacted the county

03:54:38.560 --> 03:54:40.600
and said, we didn't get a copy of the petition.

03:54:40.600 --> 03:54:42.880
The law requires that we get a copy of the petition.

03:54:42.880 --> 03:54:44.040
The county told us that,

03:54:44.040 --> 03:54:46.160
brought it to our attention correctly.

03:54:46.160 --> 03:54:48.320
And we provided a copy of the petition

03:54:48.320 --> 03:54:51.640
on December 31st to the district.

03:54:51.640 --> 03:54:53.640
The statute requires that we provide it to the district

03:54:53.640 --> 03:54:55.040
that we did on that date.

03:54:55.840 --> 03:54:59.040
The district complained that they didn't have

03:54:59.040 --> 03:55:00.840
all the appeal materials.

03:55:00.840 --> 03:55:01.920
So what we did,

03:55:01.920 --> 03:55:04.520
which is not required for us to provide them by the way.

03:55:04.520 --> 03:55:06.960
So what we did on January 5th was,

03:55:06.960 --> 03:55:10.120
we provided the district a copy of all

03:55:10.120 --> 03:55:13.480
the petition materials that had been provided to the county.

03:55:13.480 --> 03:55:15.240
When I say them, we provided the district

03:55:15.240 --> 03:55:17.360
a copy of all the appeal materials

03:55:17.360 --> 03:55:18.800
that had been provided to the county,

03:55:18.800 --> 03:55:19.760
which is our letter,

03:55:19.760 --> 03:55:21.560
a copy of the district's own findings

03:55:22.520 --> 03:55:26.800
and in our appeal cover letter, essentially,

03:55:26.800 --> 03:55:28.240
the substance of the appeal.

03:55:28.240 --> 03:55:30.920
The statute only requires that we provide the petition.

03:55:30.920 --> 03:55:32.520
We did that on the 31st of December,

03:55:32.520 --> 03:55:34.360
but we provided even more on the 5th.

03:55:35.680 --> 03:55:36.520
Thank you.

03:55:36.520 --> 03:55:37.640
And that's because, by the way,

03:55:37.640 --> 03:55:39.480
I'm sorry, I was just gonna say that,

03:55:39.480 --> 03:55:42.080
that's because the district was complaining

03:55:42.080 --> 03:55:42.920
about the process.

03:55:42.920 --> 03:55:46.520
The district wanted the county to remand it back to them.

03:55:46.520 --> 03:55:48.640
So they would hold onto it for another 30 days

03:55:48.640 --> 03:55:49.720
and perhaps do nothing.

03:55:49.720 --> 03:55:50.640
That was the intent.

03:55:51.200 --> 03:55:53.880
That's what was going on procedurally at the time.

03:55:53.880 --> 03:55:56.400
And if you dig into this voluminous record,

03:55:56.400 --> 03:55:59.000
you'll see that in the correspondence.

03:55:59.000 --> 03:55:59.840
Thank you.

03:55:59.840 --> 03:56:00.680
Thank you.

03:56:00.680 --> 03:56:04.320
Erika, did you want to make an additional comment

03:56:04.320 --> 03:56:06.360
or will you finish?

03:56:08.040 --> 03:56:10.360
I wanted to, and thank you.

03:56:10.360 --> 03:56:12.280
Thank you so much to the representatives

03:56:12.280 --> 03:56:15.920
for the petition.

03:56:15.920 --> 03:56:19.120
I also wanted to, excuse me just a moment.

03:56:19.160 --> 03:56:23.320
I also wanted to ask for just feedback

03:56:23.320 --> 03:56:28.320
on that same topic from the county office as well.

03:56:28.440 --> 03:56:29.280
Thank you.

03:56:32.480 --> 03:56:33.880
Thank you.

03:56:33.880 --> 03:56:38.160
So what was the physical petition itself

03:56:38.160 --> 03:56:42.440
was the same submitted to the county and the district.

03:56:42.440 --> 03:56:47.440
The issue is that the petitioners submitted a cover letter

03:56:48.400 --> 03:56:51.800
as well as nine different exhibits.

03:56:51.800 --> 03:56:54.600
Some of those exhibits contained new information

03:56:54.600 --> 03:56:58.760
that had not been presented to the district originally.

03:56:59.840 --> 03:57:03.120
So the district was requesting to see all the information

03:57:03.120 --> 03:57:06.480
that was provided and requesting that we remand

03:57:06.480 --> 03:57:09.440
the petition to them if there were material changes

03:57:09.440 --> 03:57:12.280
that required remand under the statute.

03:57:12.280 --> 03:57:14.600
So we needed that information to be provided

03:57:14.600 --> 03:57:17.200
to the district so that they could review that.

03:57:18.040 --> 03:57:19.000
And if you look in the documentary record,

03:57:19.000 --> 03:57:23.160
in fact, there was an agreement to redact those portions

03:57:23.160 --> 03:57:26.960
of the appeal packet that were disputed

03:57:26.960 --> 03:57:28.520
and that were additional information

03:57:28.520 --> 03:57:30.560
that were provided to the county board

03:57:30.560 --> 03:57:32.920
that had not been provided to the district

03:57:32.920 --> 03:57:37.200
so as to make it so that the entire appeal packet

03:57:37.200 --> 03:57:40.160
was the same information that was provided

03:57:40.160 --> 03:57:43.920
to Napa Valley Unified School District Board of Trustees

03:57:43.920 --> 03:57:46.720
and the Napa County Board of Education.

03:57:47.240 --> 03:57:50.880
So there was a lot of come back and forth here

03:57:50.880 --> 03:57:53.840
in order to get that appeal packet to the point

03:57:53.840 --> 03:57:56.800
where it was the same information

03:57:56.800 --> 03:57:59.840
that had been presented to the district initially.

03:58:01.320 --> 03:58:02.320
Thank you.

03:58:02.320 --> 03:58:06.320
I just want to remind panelists that if we want to call,

03:58:08.320 --> 03:58:11.680
if you're calling me, you can certainly respond

03:58:11.680 --> 03:58:13.680
but otherwise not to interject.

03:58:13.680 --> 03:58:14.920
Thanks.

03:58:14.960 --> 03:58:16.800
Any other members of our school can follow.

03:58:18.560 --> 03:58:20.240
I have another question.

03:58:20.240 --> 03:58:22.320
I'm looking at the county's findings

03:58:22.320 --> 03:58:26.240
and I see numerous examples of fiscal and community impact

03:58:26.240 --> 03:58:28.360
of the proposed school cited.

03:58:28.360 --> 03:58:30.840
So including cuts of staffing and programs,

03:58:30.840 --> 03:58:32.160
additional school closures,

03:58:32.160 --> 03:58:34.280
entering into fiscal distress,

03:58:34.280 --> 03:58:37.080
cutting 34 teaching jobs and more.

03:58:37.080 --> 03:58:39.280
I'd like to ask the county to talk more

03:58:39.280 --> 03:58:41.520
about the fiscal and community impact

03:58:41.520 --> 03:58:44.960
of this charter on Napa Unified School District

03:58:44.960 --> 03:58:45.920
and its students.

03:58:46.920 --> 03:58:47.760
Sure.

03:58:47.760 --> 03:58:52.760
So I could just ask that those that be framed

03:58:53.160 --> 03:58:55.840
in the context of the findings of that

03:58:55.840 --> 03:58:58.840
that were made at the board meeting, that would be helpful.

03:59:00.720 --> 03:59:01.560
Sure.

03:59:01.560 --> 03:59:06.280
So as the findings reflect and as the staff report

03:59:06.280 --> 03:59:09.280
and the staff presentation at the March 15th board meeting

03:59:09.280 --> 03:59:13.480
reflect, Napa Valley Unified has been in steady

03:59:13.480 --> 03:59:16.280
declining enrollment since about 2015.

03:59:16.280 --> 03:59:18.640
It predates all of these disputes.

03:59:18.640 --> 03:59:20.840
It's based on demographics, it's based on births,

03:59:20.840 --> 03:59:23.880
it's based on household formation in the county.

03:59:23.880 --> 03:59:26.920
Nothing about this decision is going to change that.

03:59:28.200 --> 03:59:30.000
Again, Department of Finance is projecting

03:59:30.000 --> 03:59:32.520
that Napa County is declining more rapidly

03:59:32.520 --> 03:59:34.080
than almost any other county in the States

03:59:34.080 --> 03:59:36.520
in the top five, both for the one year, five year,

03:59:36.520 --> 03:59:37.600
10 year forecast.

03:59:39.920 --> 03:59:41.800
That includes their projections

03:59:41.800 --> 03:59:43.800
for adding transitional kindergarten

03:59:43.800 --> 03:59:45.800
and that is in the analysis.

03:59:45.800 --> 03:59:48.680
So that includes the projections for adding TK students.

03:59:48.680 --> 03:59:52.160
They're still gonna decline and they're gonna decline steadily.

03:59:52.160 --> 03:59:57.000
So what our analysis found was that in that circumstance,

03:59:57.000 --> 03:59:59.040
adding the additional decline of initially

03:59:59.040 --> 04:00:01.560
about 100 students and growing to over 300 students

04:00:01.560 --> 04:00:03.400
over a number of years based upon the charter

04:00:03.400 --> 04:00:08.400
petitions projections was going to require additional cuts

04:00:08.880 --> 04:00:10.520
to the district's budget when they're already dealing

04:00:10.520 --> 04:00:13.920
with declining enrollment of initially over a million dollars

04:00:13.920 --> 04:00:16.320
and growing to well over $3 million

04:00:16.320 --> 04:00:20.320
if the charter met its projected enrollment.

04:00:20.320 --> 04:00:24.560
And again, if you lose 100 students

04:00:24.560 --> 04:00:28.440
and let's say you have a staffing ratio of 25 to one,

04:00:28.440 --> 04:00:30.600
you can cut for teachers, right?

04:00:30.600 --> 04:00:32.240
And that's an impact, but it's an impact

04:00:32.240 --> 04:00:34.720
that you can offset by reducing staffing.

04:00:34.720 --> 04:00:36.640
But cutting the classroom staffing

04:00:36.640 --> 04:00:41.240
only gets you about 35% of the cuts you need to make

04:00:41.240 --> 04:00:43.680
for the revenue that is lost for those students.

04:00:43.680 --> 04:00:46.160
So you have to go and you have to cut elsewhere

04:00:46.160 --> 04:00:50.600
to deal with it and Governor Brown may disagree

04:00:50.600 --> 04:00:53.440
about whether an additional two, $3 million a year

04:00:53.440 --> 04:00:56.480
is material, but what we presented to the County Board

04:00:56.480 --> 04:00:58.920
was you may consider this material

04:00:58.920 --> 04:01:00.720
and we left it to their judgment, right?

04:01:00.720 --> 04:01:03.400
We didn't make a staff recommendation.

04:01:03.400 --> 04:01:06.800
But the reality is, I think those of you

04:01:06.800 --> 04:01:09.240
who've been practitioners in school districts know

04:01:09.240 --> 04:01:12.160
cutting an additional two, $3 million from your budget

04:01:12.160 --> 04:01:15.120
every year is difficult and it's challenging.

04:01:15.120 --> 04:01:19.480
And while right now districts appear flush in this state

04:01:19.480 --> 04:01:21.920
and Napa Valley Unified has healthy reserves

04:01:21.920 --> 04:01:24.240
like most districts do because of all the one-time money

04:01:24.240 --> 04:01:27.680
that has come in, we know that declining enrollment

04:01:27.680 --> 04:01:29.080
is going to continue.

04:01:29.080 --> 04:01:32.040
We know that we're not gonna continue to see revenue growth

04:01:32.040 --> 04:01:34.400
and the way we've seen it in the past year,

04:01:34.400 --> 04:01:35.800
we look at what's happening at the stock market,

04:01:35.800 --> 04:01:38.480
the state's dependence on capital gains.

04:01:38.480 --> 04:01:42.440
So we projected that this is going to add on

04:01:42.440 --> 04:01:44.560
to your fiscal distress.

04:01:44.560 --> 04:01:47.480
And also, as a reminder, and this is also

04:01:47.480 --> 04:01:50.080
in the documentary record, the County Office

04:01:50.080 --> 04:01:53.280
is in the position of having fiscal oversight of districts.

04:01:53.280 --> 04:01:56.200
That's a core role for a County Office of Education, right?

04:01:56.200 --> 04:01:58.080
The AB 1200 fiscal oversight.

04:01:58.960 --> 04:02:03.960
It is an accepted fact in terms of school business operations

04:02:04.760 --> 04:02:06.640
that when you are steadily declining enrollment,

04:02:06.640 --> 04:02:09.840
you have to do things like close small schools

04:02:09.840 --> 04:02:12.400
because otherwise you cannot get ahead of it.

04:02:12.400 --> 04:02:13.760
And those districts that in the state

04:02:13.760 --> 04:02:15.840
that are consistently in fiscal distress

04:02:15.840 --> 04:02:16.960
are the ones that have not been able

04:02:16.960 --> 04:02:19.080
to deal with those issues.

04:02:19.080 --> 04:02:21.840
And so one of the things that the County considered

04:02:21.840 --> 04:02:24.160
is the fact that this charter petition

04:02:24.160 --> 04:02:27.040
was directly in response to the closure

04:02:27.040 --> 04:02:30.800
of a small school program and that if,

04:02:30.800 --> 04:02:32.880
and there's a letter in the documentary record

04:02:32.880 --> 04:02:35.760
that I had signed in 2019 telling the district

04:02:35.760 --> 04:02:37.440
that they needed to do things like close small schools

04:02:37.440 --> 04:02:39.280
so well before this decision was made.

04:02:41.040 --> 04:02:44.120
If a district has to deal with a charter coming

04:02:44.120 --> 04:02:46.000
and taking the students every time they close

04:02:46.000 --> 04:02:48.600
a small school, that's going to make it very difficult

04:02:48.600 --> 04:02:49.640
for a district administration

04:02:49.640 --> 04:02:52.920
to make those difficult decisions, and they are painful.

04:02:52.920 --> 04:02:54.120
And other schools were closed

04:02:54.120 --> 04:02:56.480
besides the River School that is in dispute here.

04:02:57.640 --> 04:03:00.520
But the fact is they made decisions they have to make.

04:03:00.520 --> 04:03:02.560
You can disagree about whether they close the right school.

04:03:02.560 --> 04:03:04.520
I know there's disputes about how it happened

04:03:04.520 --> 04:03:06.200
and bad feelings there,

04:03:06.200 --> 04:03:08.120
but from the standpoint of fiscal impact,

04:03:08.120 --> 04:03:10.720
it's undeniable that adding the charter school

04:03:10.720 --> 04:03:13.160
and the lost enrollment to an already declining enrollment

04:03:13.160 --> 04:03:15.200
creates a very difficult situation

04:03:15.200 --> 04:03:17.320
for a district administration.

04:03:17.320 --> 04:03:18.880
I hope that answered your question.

04:03:20.160 --> 04:03:21.000
Yes, thank you.

04:03:22.000 --> 04:03:26.080
Other comments or discussion?

04:03:35.640 --> 04:03:36.480
Member Olken.

04:03:38.480 --> 04:03:39.320
Thank you.

04:03:39.320 --> 04:03:42.160
I was struggling to get my little electric hand up.

04:03:43.680 --> 04:03:48.680
So I just want to share after having reviewed

04:03:49.680 --> 04:03:54.680
the documentary record in great detail,

04:03:56.040 --> 04:04:00.840
I wanted to share my perspective on this

04:04:00.840 --> 04:04:05.440
for our consideration, recognizing that,

04:04:08.240 --> 04:04:13.240
as I've said before, this is a new role for us

04:04:13.440 --> 04:04:18.440
and it's an important time in the landscape

04:04:18.720 --> 04:04:23.440
of public education, but I feel compelled to share

04:04:23.440 --> 04:04:25.320
sort of my take on where we are.

04:04:26.200 --> 04:04:28.760
After reviewing the documentary record,

04:04:28.760 --> 04:04:32.440
I do believe there is evidence of abuse of discretion.

04:04:34.040 --> 04:04:37.920
My commis charter middle school has made a compelling case

04:04:37.920 --> 04:04:40.280
that the district process was biased.

04:04:41.160 --> 04:04:42.880
I'm not convinced that it was possible

04:04:42.880 --> 04:04:45.000
for the charter school to receive a fair

04:04:45.000 --> 04:04:47.400
and impartial hearing and decision

04:04:47.440 --> 04:04:49.760
from the Napa Valley Unified School

04:04:49.760 --> 04:04:51.120
District Governing Board.

04:04:52.040 --> 04:04:55.280
The district process appears to have required much more

04:04:55.280 --> 04:04:59.080
than the already arduous process laid out by law.

04:04:59.080 --> 04:05:01.680
For example, a capacity interview

04:05:01.680 --> 04:05:04.080
is not a requirement of law and yet it appears

04:05:04.080 --> 04:05:06.240
to have been held against the petitioners

04:05:08.080 --> 04:05:13.080
when it was requested and held against them.

04:05:14.280 --> 04:05:16.840
It's unclear to me why the district limited petitioners

04:05:16.840 --> 04:05:19.640
to have only one of their content experts

04:05:19.640 --> 04:05:22.080
at the capacity interview.

04:05:22.080 --> 04:05:24.800
It does seem to me like there was an element

04:05:24.800 --> 04:05:27.360
of intimidation in this process.

04:05:28.560 --> 04:05:31.200
I'm concerned about the testimony and public comment

04:05:31.200 --> 04:05:34.000
found in the documentary record,

04:05:34.000 --> 04:05:37.360
shared at the ACCS meeting and even today

04:05:37.360 --> 04:05:40.400
that verged on attacking the petitioner's motives

04:05:40.400 --> 04:05:42.800
and intent to serve the entire community.

04:05:43.880 --> 04:05:46.280
The charter petition is very intentional

04:05:46.280 --> 04:05:49.280
in describing how my iconist planned to operate

04:05:49.280 --> 04:05:51.800
in a part of town that in and of itself

04:05:51.800 --> 04:05:54.360
would draw a diverse school population

04:05:54.360 --> 04:05:58.320
in terms of income, ethnicity and language.

04:06:00.000 --> 04:06:01.480
In my mind, the stark difference

04:06:01.480 --> 04:06:03.760
between how the county reviewed the charter

04:06:03.760 --> 04:06:05.640
and how the district reviewed the charter

04:06:05.640 --> 04:06:06.880
is another example.

04:06:08.600 --> 04:06:11.080
The county did not find one single element

04:06:11.080 --> 04:06:14.520
of the charter petition to be flawed or lacking.

04:06:14.520 --> 04:06:16.760
In fact, the review was glowing.

04:06:16.760 --> 04:06:20.800
By contrast, the district review was quite harsh

04:06:20.800 --> 04:06:23.880
and raised a multitude of concerns.

04:06:23.880 --> 04:06:27.960
And while it is not our job to decide who was right,

04:06:27.960 --> 04:06:32.280
this difference points to a significant bias.

04:06:32.280 --> 04:06:35.800
In my opinion, the district process as a whole

04:06:35.800 --> 04:06:37.800
was a clear abuse of discretion.

04:06:39.840 --> 04:06:41.400
One of the big things we've been talking about

04:06:41.400 --> 04:06:45.200
is the timeline for the county decision.

04:06:45.200 --> 04:06:49.960
And even if we presume that their denial

04:06:49.960 --> 04:06:51.680
and written findings fell within

04:06:51.680 --> 04:06:53.880
the legally prescribed timeline,

04:06:53.880 --> 04:06:57.520
and I'm not gonna fall into that.

04:06:57.520 --> 04:06:59.880
I'm not gonna make comment on that.

04:06:59.880 --> 04:07:01.680
The process by which they derived

04:07:01.680 --> 04:07:04.720
their written findings was suspect.

04:07:04.720 --> 04:07:06.960
The petitioners did not receive a transcript

04:07:06.960 --> 04:07:08.680
of the April 5th meeting.

04:07:08.680 --> 04:07:10.960
This limited their ability to make citations

04:07:10.960 --> 04:07:12.800
to the documentary record.

04:07:12.800 --> 04:07:14.920
This feels like a big process error to me.

04:07:16.240 --> 04:07:18.640
As the documentary record shows,

04:07:18.640 --> 04:07:21.280
while the county board discussed the findings,

04:07:22.160 --> 04:07:24.480
which were written based on the recollections

04:07:24.480 --> 04:07:27.040
of a subset of their board members,

04:07:27.040 --> 04:07:28.480
there's quite a bit of discussion

04:07:28.480 --> 04:07:30.320
about whether they actually captured

04:07:30.320 --> 04:07:32.280
that discussion or not.

04:07:33.960 --> 04:07:36.040
The county board based their determination

04:07:36.040 --> 04:07:38.000
on the specific criterion of the law

04:07:38.000 --> 04:07:39.960
that suggests the charter school

04:07:39.960 --> 04:07:42.200
is demonstrably unlikely to serve

04:07:42.200 --> 04:07:43.920
the interests of the entire community

04:07:43.920 --> 04:07:46.120
in which the school's proposing to locate.

04:07:47.360 --> 04:07:49.520
The reasoning was not based upon

04:07:49.520 --> 04:07:51.160
which students the charter would attract,

04:07:51.160 --> 04:07:52.400
retain, and serve.

04:07:52.400 --> 04:07:54.600
Instead, it was based on the district's assertion

04:07:54.600 --> 04:07:57.040
the charter would cause financial harm.

04:07:57.040 --> 04:08:01.040
The district's argument about the financial ramifications

04:08:01.040 --> 04:08:03.440
of the new charter seemed threatening.

04:08:04.960 --> 04:08:07.040
Napa Valley Unified projects

04:08:07.080 --> 04:08:10.480
that have to reduce the number of teachers by 34

04:08:10.480 --> 04:08:12.640
over the first five years of the charter

04:08:12.640 --> 04:08:14.440
would have to close additional schools,

04:08:14.440 --> 04:08:17.800
reduce programs and services to students,

04:08:17.800 --> 04:08:19.960
and reduce expenditures on contracts

04:08:19.960 --> 04:08:21.600
in order to mitigate the loss of funding

04:08:21.600 --> 04:08:25.200
associated with the loss of students

04:08:25.200 --> 04:08:26.760
to my economist charter.

04:08:28.800 --> 04:08:30.520
The district suggests that the establishment

04:08:30.520 --> 04:08:33.080
of a charter school that will grow over five years

04:08:33.080 --> 04:08:36.040
from 180 to 336 students

04:08:36.040 --> 04:08:39.160
may cause a result in elimination

04:08:39.160 --> 04:08:41.120
of middle school sports programs

04:08:41.120 --> 04:08:44.200
and elementary school music and physical education programs

04:08:44.200 --> 04:08:48.400
and counselors and intervention teachers and electives

04:08:48.400 --> 04:08:50.680
and further closures.

04:08:50.680 --> 04:08:54.760
They also alleged that if the charter were approved,

04:08:54.760 --> 04:08:58.280
they anticipated renegotiating and or ending contracts

04:08:58.280 --> 04:09:00.720
with the Napa County Office of Education

04:09:00.720 --> 04:09:04.320
for afterschool programs, summer programs, and CTE programs.

04:09:05.320 --> 04:09:07.560
These assertions seem overstated

04:09:07.560 --> 04:09:09.840
and intended to intimidate potential supporters

04:09:09.840 --> 04:09:13.480
of my economists, particularly in this era

04:09:13.480 --> 04:09:15.480
when there are increased state allocations

04:09:15.480 --> 04:09:16.880
to public education.

04:09:18.240 --> 04:09:20.160
I am disturbed by the threats

04:09:20.160 --> 04:09:21.920
that Napa Valley Unified School District

04:09:21.920 --> 04:09:24.400
specifically named canceling contracts

04:09:24.400 --> 04:09:25.920
with the county office.

04:09:25.920 --> 04:09:28.040
This appeared to be a tactic to dissuade the county

04:09:28.040 --> 04:09:29.560
from approving the petition.

04:09:30.400 --> 04:09:35.360
It is for these reasons that I do feel

04:09:35.360 --> 04:09:38.040
that an abuse of discretion occurred

04:09:38.040 --> 04:09:41.040
at the county and district levels.

04:09:41.040 --> 04:09:43.000
I feel compelled to share all this with you

04:09:43.000 --> 04:09:46.000
and thank you for your consideration.

04:09:49.320 --> 04:09:50.160
Thank you.

04:09:51.640 --> 04:09:55.640
Member Klobberwitz and then Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

04:09:56.200 --> 04:09:58.840
I can speak after Member Orozco-Gonzalez

04:09:58.840 --> 04:10:00.480
if that would be appropriate.

04:10:04.480 --> 04:10:06.920
That would be fine, Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

04:10:08.080 --> 04:10:09.840
Thank you, Ms. Klobberwitz.

04:10:09.840 --> 04:10:11.640
I just have another question

04:10:11.640 --> 04:10:15.560
because I'm looking at this and I'm thinking,

04:10:15.560 --> 04:10:18.000
this is a question for Stephanie Farland.

04:10:18.000 --> 04:10:20.520
It is my understanding that our job is to consider

04:10:20.520 --> 04:10:23.960
the documentary record only and the CTE staff report

04:10:24.960 --> 04:10:28.440
is clear that the petitioner lacks specific citations

04:10:28.440 --> 04:10:32.080
and details to support the MCM's allegations.

04:10:32.080 --> 04:10:34.800
While I see numerous citations to support the district

04:10:34.800 --> 04:10:37.080
and county's findings in the record,

04:10:37.080 --> 04:10:39.160
I'd like Stephanie just to speak a little bit more

04:10:39.160 --> 04:10:41.640
about the lack of citations in more detail.

04:10:44.360 --> 04:10:47.440
Sure, you are correct.

04:10:47.440 --> 04:10:48.640
There are numerous footnotes

04:10:48.640 --> 04:10:51.280
and I think we gave the exact number earlier

04:10:51.280 --> 04:10:53.240
in my presentation.

04:10:53.400 --> 04:10:55.680
The problem with the citations

04:10:55.680 --> 04:10:58.240
that they weren't specific citations

04:10:58.240 --> 04:10:59.680
actually showing us evidence

04:10:59.680 --> 04:11:02.440
of where the abuse of discretion took place.

04:11:02.440 --> 04:11:07.440
In one of the slides, I gave an example of citations

04:11:07.720 --> 04:11:09.560
going back to 28 page reports,

04:11:09.560 --> 04:11:12.200
citations going back to a list of findings

04:11:12.200 --> 04:11:14.520
without being specific about where those,

04:11:14.520 --> 04:11:17.320
where the abuse of discretion took place.

04:11:17.320 --> 04:11:19.920
And from the CDE's perspective,

04:11:19.920 --> 04:11:21.200
it is on the burden of the charter

04:11:21.200 --> 04:11:23.200
to show us exactly where that is,

04:11:24.120 --> 04:11:25.120
we can't comb through it

04:11:25.120 --> 04:11:27.280
and try to make up that on our own.

04:11:27.280 --> 04:11:29.720
So we are expected,

04:11:29.720 --> 04:11:31.440
our charters are expected to have,

04:11:31.440 --> 04:11:33.000
give us, and it's in Ed code,

04:11:33.000 --> 04:11:35.720
specific citations to the documentary record.

04:11:35.720 --> 04:11:40.640
And we felt that those were not specific citations.

04:11:42.360 --> 04:11:43.400
Thank you.

04:11:43.400 --> 04:11:45.080
Cause I see based on the review

04:11:45.080 --> 04:11:47.680
and the appeal of the documentary record,

04:11:47.680 --> 04:11:49.480
I don't see that there's any evidence

04:11:49.480 --> 04:11:50.880
of abuse of discretion

04:11:50.880 --> 04:11:53.080
by either the district or the county board.

04:11:53.960 --> 04:11:56.760
I feel like the CDE's analysis

04:11:56.760 --> 04:12:00.720
gives us really our duty as a board to implement the law.

04:12:00.720 --> 04:12:02.080
And this is clearly a decision

04:12:02.080 --> 04:12:05.720
by both the local district and the county board,

04:12:05.720 --> 04:12:07.320
I feel has followed the law.

04:12:07.320 --> 04:12:09.840
So thank you so much for your information.

04:12:13.400 --> 04:12:16.720
Member Glover-Wood and then member Olken,

04:12:16.720 --> 04:12:18.040
is your hand up too?

04:12:19.000 --> 04:12:20.240
All right, okay.

04:12:20.240 --> 04:12:22.040
Member Glover-Wood.

04:12:22.040 --> 04:12:24.000
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond.

04:12:24.840 --> 04:12:29.160
First, let me say before I asked my question,

04:12:29.160 --> 04:12:32.840
I definitely appreciate the comments made by member Olken.

04:12:33.720 --> 04:12:36.680
One of our goals as a public education system

04:12:36.680 --> 04:12:39.080
is to be sure we have great schools for students.

04:12:39.080 --> 04:12:42.000
And that's inclusive of what would be a traditional,

04:12:42.000 --> 04:12:44.200
what would be considered a traditional public school

04:12:44.200 --> 04:12:45.600
as well as charter schools.

04:12:45.640 --> 04:12:47.480
And I think that's where charter schools play

04:12:47.480 --> 04:12:50.080
a very, very important role

04:12:50.080 --> 04:12:53.480
in the education of students in California.

04:12:53.480 --> 04:12:57.160
Also, I want to say that procedures matter.

04:12:57.160 --> 04:12:59.680
And it's very, very important that as again,

04:12:59.680 --> 04:13:01.840
we are all getting acquainted

04:13:01.840 --> 04:13:05.200
and knowing how to best address things

04:13:05.200 --> 04:13:08.000
that come forward in the form of petitions

04:13:08.000 --> 04:13:11.520
that procedures, timelines and whatnot

04:13:11.520 --> 04:13:13.560
continue to be followed.

04:13:13.720 --> 04:13:15.920
I do want to ask,

04:13:15.920 --> 04:13:17.760
and then I have another comment to make.

04:13:17.760 --> 04:13:20.760
I wanted to ask Director Farlin

04:13:20.760 --> 04:13:25.160
about what is necessary

04:13:25.160 --> 04:13:27.920
when we're looking at abuse of discretion.

04:13:27.920 --> 04:13:29.440
If the board were to determine

04:13:29.440 --> 04:13:31.800
that there was an abuse of discretion,

04:13:31.800 --> 04:13:35.280
does that need to reflect that the abuse of discretion

04:13:35.280 --> 04:13:39.560
happened at both the district and county levels,

04:13:39.560 --> 04:13:43.520
or could abuse of discretion happen at one level

04:13:44.520 --> 04:13:45.600
and not the other?

04:13:45.600 --> 04:13:49.480
And I think that's my question.

04:13:49.480 --> 04:13:51.840
Does it need to have occurred at both the district

04:13:51.840 --> 04:13:54.120
and the county board or just one?

04:13:56.080 --> 04:13:58.560
It is the CDE's understanding

04:13:58.560 --> 04:14:00.160
that it needs to happen at both.

04:14:02.360 --> 04:14:05.320
Okay, thank you, thank you very much.

04:14:05.320 --> 04:14:09.360
And just my, I'm not sure if this will be my closing comment,

04:14:09.360 --> 04:14:13.400
but a comment that I wanted to make as well

04:14:14.240 --> 04:14:15.640
and it goes a little bit back to the initial comments

04:14:15.640 --> 04:14:20.000
that I made at the beginning of our discussion of the item.

04:14:20.000 --> 04:14:23.000
I do believe that the statute is very clear

04:14:23.000 --> 04:14:26.720
that as a board, we have to base our decision

04:14:26.720 --> 04:14:29.240
on the documentary record and the evidence

04:14:29.240 --> 04:14:32.440
that is outlined in the documentary record

04:14:32.440 --> 04:14:37.240
as it relates to the allegations for abuse of discretion.

04:14:38.400 --> 04:14:41.520
We cannot, per my understanding

04:14:41.760 --> 04:14:44.240
and what I have read,

04:14:44.240 --> 04:14:48.640
base that decision on anything outside of that.

04:14:48.640 --> 04:14:50.760
Again, whether we feel that the district

04:14:50.760 --> 04:14:53.160
and county board's findings were the findings

04:14:53.160 --> 04:14:54.240
they should have come up with

04:14:54.240 --> 04:14:55.360
or that they shouldn't have come up

04:14:55.360 --> 04:14:57.440
with any findings at all,

04:14:57.440 --> 04:15:01.280
we are to look at the evidence that's been given to us

04:15:01.280 --> 04:15:03.120
and then make our decision

04:15:03.120 --> 04:15:05.760
on if there was an abuse of discretion

04:15:05.760 --> 04:15:09.120
and if that abuse of discretion took place

04:15:09.120 --> 04:15:11.560
per the definitions that we've received.

04:15:11.560 --> 04:15:14.240
So I just want to underscore that

04:15:14.240 --> 04:15:18.800
and acknowledge this is a difficult decision

04:15:18.800 --> 04:15:21.680
and I won't give any other commentary

04:15:21.680 --> 04:15:25.000
on my thoughts on either end of this,

04:15:25.000 --> 04:15:26.560
but it's a difficult decision,

04:15:26.560 --> 04:15:29.520
but I just ask us to adhere to, again,

04:15:29.520 --> 04:15:33.000
the statute that we have been tied to

04:15:33.000 --> 04:15:35.400
and make our decision based upon that.

04:15:35.400 --> 04:15:40.400
I will add a comment

04:15:41.480 --> 04:15:44.400
and then see if we can move towards a motion.

04:15:44.400 --> 04:15:46.800
I'm aware that we're gonna start losing

04:15:46.800 --> 04:15:51.080
a couple of our board members in the next half an hour.

04:15:53.720 --> 04:15:55.480
When we have this,

04:15:55.480 --> 04:15:59.080
experienced this kind of discussion and hearing,

04:15:59.080 --> 04:16:02.120
it does feel like a he said, she said,

04:16:02.120 --> 04:16:04.360
and we hear different things back and forth

04:16:04.360 --> 04:16:05.920
from both sides.

04:16:06.800 --> 04:16:10.880
Like our liaisons, I went back to

04:16:10.880 --> 04:16:12.800
and read the record in great detail

04:16:12.800 --> 04:16:15.040
and asked for additional documentation.

04:16:15.920 --> 04:16:19.400
And I do share the concerns voiced by member Olken.

04:16:20.480 --> 04:16:25.160
I also think that on the question of the timeline,

04:16:25.160 --> 04:16:28.720
you could make an interpretation either way,

04:16:28.720 --> 04:16:33.480
but the charter school did send the petition,

04:16:33.480 --> 04:16:38.480
which was the requirement of the law by December 31st,

04:16:39.040 --> 04:16:41.080
which then raises the question as to whether

04:16:41.080 --> 04:16:46.080
other elements of the timing by themselves constituted

04:16:46.360 --> 04:16:48.560
and abuse of discretion.

04:16:48.560 --> 04:16:50.200
And again, that can be read both ways

04:16:50.200 --> 04:16:54.000
and we've heard both versions of

04:16:54.000 --> 04:16:55.320
whether it was just the petition

04:16:55.320 --> 04:16:58.560
or it needed to have the attachments, et cetera.

04:16:58.560 --> 04:17:00.240
I did look at the citations.

04:17:00.240 --> 04:17:03.360
I think in many cases they were as specific

04:17:04.240 --> 04:17:09.240
as one needed to have to see what the record was saying,

04:17:09.280 --> 04:17:12.480
although I think the CDE would have preferred

04:17:12.480 --> 04:17:17.480
and I understand why the actual statement

04:17:18.240 --> 04:17:21.520
or sentence or paragraph to be stated in full

04:17:21.520 --> 04:17:24.520
rather than simply referenced in an end note.

04:17:26.320 --> 04:17:30.520
And I am still concerned about the way in which

04:17:30.680 --> 04:17:35.680
the fiscal analysis of declining enrollment was,

04:17:38.680 --> 04:17:42.360
in my view, in the record from the county meeting,

04:17:42.360 --> 04:17:45.760
not sufficient to sustain all of the statements

04:17:45.760 --> 04:17:49.000
that have been made about fiscal impacts on the community.

04:17:50.000 --> 04:17:52.200
So I do think that this case is a close call

04:17:53.400 --> 04:17:56.720
and I think the county due diligence,

04:17:56.720 --> 04:17:59.240
this process was a well-intentioned one.

04:18:00.960 --> 04:18:03.240
But I think that this is a case

04:18:03.240 --> 04:18:07.720
where we need to weigh all of those features

04:18:07.720 --> 04:18:10.360
and I'm gonna have to turn off my answering machine

04:18:10.360 --> 04:18:11.480
very quickly here.

04:18:20.080 --> 04:18:21.200
I apologize.

04:18:27.200 --> 04:18:28.560
I apologize.

04:18:28.560 --> 04:18:29.800
In order to get the internet,

04:18:29.800 --> 04:18:31.520
I've had to move all around the house

04:18:31.520 --> 04:18:36.520
and that leaves me in the process of a phone call

04:18:36.600 --> 04:18:38.320
that can be made.

04:18:38.320 --> 04:18:40.440
So I do think that this is a very close call

04:18:40.440 --> 04:18:43.480
and I think that it's important for us to be clear

04:18:43.480 --> 04:18:46.320
as people think about our future cases,

04:18:46.320 --> 04:18:51.320
both about the need for an even more complete record

04:18:53.160 --> 04:18:56.320
for us to be able to examine

04:18:56.320 --> 04:19:01.320
because we don't wanna be in a he said, she said conversation

04:19:02.000 --> 04:19:05.320
and that we need to be very clear

04:19:05.320 --> 04:19:10.000
that we're working together here to be sure

04:19:10.000 --> 04:19:13.200
that the process is fair and impartial and unbiased

04:19:13.200 --> 04:19:16.400
from the beginning and then complete and thorough

04:19:16.400 --> 04:19:19.560
and with respect to all of the technical details

04:19:19.560 --> 04:19:20.400
through the end.

04:19:20.680 --> 04:19:25.680
With that, I think that it is sufficiently concerning

04:19:32.680 --> 04:19:35.000
that we could find abuse of discretion

04:19:35.000 --> 04:19:37.160
on multiple grounds in this case,

04:19:38.160 --> 04:19:42.320
but I also understand that the evidentiary records

04:19:42.320 --> 04:19:46.160
could be more thorough in our deliberation.

04:19:47.160 --> 04:19:52.160
I will leave it at that to say I'm open to a motion

04:19:52.920 --> 04:19:56.960
and we wanna move the conversation further

04:19:56.960 --> 04:19:58.760
if there are any further questions.

04:20:05.080 --> 04:20:06.120
Member Glover Woods.

04:20:09.240 --> 04:20:12.680
Again, kind of based on the evidence

04:20:12.680 --> 04:20:16.720
that was given to us in the documentary record,

04:20:16.720 --> 04:20:21.720
I move that we affirm the decision that was made

04:20:22.200 --> 04:20:25.720
by the school district and county board

04:20:25.720 --> 04:20:27.120
to deny the petition.

04:20:29.800 --> 04:20:31.840
Do we have a second for that motion?

04:20:33.200 --> 04:20:34.040
I'll second that.

04:20:35.440 --> 04:20:38.560
Member Rodriguez, is there any further discussion?

04:20:39.360 --> 04:20:44.360
All right, with that, Brooks King, you call the roll call vote.

04:20:45.080 --> 04:20:46.080
President Darling-Hammond.

04:20:48.720 --> 04:20:50.680
I will vote nay.

04:20:52.240 --> 04:20:53.080
Member Escobedo.

04:20:54.360 --> 04:20:55.200
I vote nay.

04:20:57.200 --> 04:20:58.720
Vice President Glover Woods.

04:20:59.680 --> 04:21:00.520
Yes.

04:21:01.400 --> 04:21:02.240
Member Lewis.

04:21:03.960 --> 04:21:04.800
Yes.

04:21:05.520 --> 04:21:06.440
Member McQuillan.

04:21:06.440 --> 04:21:07.280
Yes.

04:21:07.760 --> 04:21:08.600
Member McQuillan.

04:21:09.600 --> 04:21:10.440
Nay.

04:21:11.360 --> 04:21:12.200
Member Olken.

04:21:15.880 --> 04:21:16.720
Nay.

04:21:17.640 --> 04:21:19.080
Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

04:21:20.360 --> 04:21:21.200
Yes.

04:21:22.800 --> 04:21:24.080
Member Petillo-Brownson.

04:21:25.120 --> 04:21:25.960
No.

04:21:27.200 --> 04:21:28.040
Member Porter.

04:21:29.200 --> 04:21:30.040
No.

04:21:31.160 --> 04:21:32.200
Member Rodriguez.

04:21:33.440 --> 04:21:34.280
Yes.

04:21:35.280 --> 04:21:36.680
Member Yoshimoto-Towry.

04:21:38.200 --> 04:21:39.040
Yes.

04:21:42.200 --> 04:21:43.200
The motion fails.

04:21:47.960 --> 04:21:52.400
At this point, I think we need to be able to

04:21:55.520 --> 04:21:56.840
document our own findings.

04:21:59.240 --> 04:22:03.920
So I'm gonna ask our director what the next step would be.

04:22:05.280 --> 04:22:07.880
Excuse me, President Darling-Hammond.

04:22:07.880 --> 04:22:11.600
I think at this point, this motion tied 5-5,

04:22:11.600 --> 04:22:12.920
according to my account.

04:22:12.920 --> 04:22:15.800
Executive Director Allen confirms.

04:22:15.800 --> 04:22:18.560
So you might want to entertain a different motion

04:22:19.720 --> 04:22:22.680
to find that there was an abuse of discretion

04:22:22.680 --> 04:22:24.800
with specific findings.

04:22:24.800 --> 04:22:27.000
Is that what you're asking for?

04:22:28.360 --> 04:22:30.360
Yes, I thought it was six to five.

04:22:31.280 --> 04:22:33.120
Oh, yep.

04:22:35.280 --> 04:22:40.280
So do we still need a affirmative motion, is that right?

04:22:40.760 --> 04:22:42.560
We would need an affirmative motion.

04:22:45.080 --> 04:22:46.320
Okay.

04:22:46.320 --> 04:22:47.160
Member Olken.

04:22:48.920 --> 04:22:50.400
I'd like to make that motion.

04:22:51.720 --> 04:22:56.240
I move that the state would reverse the determinations

04:22:56.240 --> 04:23:00.160
of the Napa Valley Unified School District Governing Board

04:23:00.160 --> 04:23:02.360
and the Napa County Board of Education

04:23:02.360 --> 04:23:05.560
to deny the Maya Commons Charter Middle School

04:23:05.560 --> 04:23:09.400
based on the State Board of Education's determination

04:23:09.400 --> 04:23:11.120
that an abuse of discretion occurred

04:23:11.120 --> 04:23:13.240
at both the county and district levels.

04:23:16.680 --> 04:23:18.320
We need a second for that motion.

04:23:30.200 --> 04:23:31.960
We do need a second for that motion.

04:23:33.000 --> 04:23:33.840
I'll second that.

04:23:35.080 --> 04:23:37.400
Thank you, Member McClellan.

04:23:37.400 --> 04:23:40.000
Now I think we have to take another roll call vote.

04:23:42.080 --> 04:23:45.080
Is there any further discussion on that motion, I should ask?

04:23:47.560 --> 04:23:51.200
I want to ask our council, Judy Saez,

04:23:51.200 --> 04:23:54.560
if that motion is framed in the appropriate way.

04:23:57.320 --> 04:24:00.400
I suggest we have some specific findings

04:24:00.440 --> 04:24:04.400
that articulate why you all are determining

04:24:04.400 --> 04:24:06.440
that there has been an abuse of discretion,

04:24:06.440 --> 04:24:09.240
and I would also add that should the board find

04:24:09.240 --> 04:24:11.560
that there has been an abuse of discretion,

04:24:11.560 --> 04:24:14.120
you will need to consult with the petitioner

04:24:14.120 --> 04:24:16.280
regarding delegation of oversight authority

04:24:16.280 --> 04:24:18.680
to either the county or the district.

04:24:18.680 --> 04:24:20.520
So there's two more steps, I believe.

04:24:21.640 --> 04:24:23.440
That both have to happen today?

04:24:23.440 --> 04:24:24.960
I mean, the first one obviously does,

04:24:24.960 --> 04:24:26.200
but the second one also?

04:24:27.840 --> 04:24:29.640
Yes, I would suggest,

04:24:29.720 --> 04:24:31.680
because otherwise then you're gonna have to bring it back

04:24:31.680 --> 04:24:35.560
to the November meeting, and I think it would be,

04:24:35.560 --> 04:24:39.200
I assume the parties would like to get started proceeding

04:24:39.200 --> 04:24:42.400
with opening the school and preparing to open the school.

04:24:46.120 --> 04:24:46.960
Member Olken?

04:24:49.160 --> 04:24:50.480
I'm wondering if,

04:24:51.440 --> 04:24:54.160
and I don't know that I'm allowed to propose this,

04:24:54.160 --> 04:24:57.560
that now that we have the motion on the floor,

04:24:57.600 --> 04:25:02.160
can we take a break to draft our findings?

04:25:03.280 --> 04:25:04.400
I'm looking at you, Judy,

04:25:04.400 --> 04:25:09.400
so that we can include them in the motion as part,

04:25:11.440 --> 04:25:15.840
or we can include them in the record before we vote.

04:25:17.480 --> 04:25:18.960
Sure, you can take a break now,

04:25:18.960 --> 04:25:23.320
and staff can try to work on some findings

04:25:23.320 --> 04:25:25.160
that reflect your discussion.

04:25:25.160 --> 04:25:26.280
I would caution all of you

04:25:26.280 --> 04:25:28.920
to not talk among yourselves at this point,

04:25:28.920 --> 04:25:32.400
because that would be a vaguely keen violation,

04:25:32.400 --> 04:25:35.360
but if you'd like to take a half hour break,

04:25:35.360 --> 04:25:38.880
we could at that point come back with findings,

04:25:38.880 --> 04:25:41.120
and we can also consult with the petitioner

04:25:41.120 --> 04:25:43.520
to determine oversight,

04:25:44.520 --> 04:25:46.320
and that can be part of your motion.

04:25:47.440 --> 04:25:48.280
All right, thank you.

04:25:48.280 --> 04:25:51.440
I think we may have a question for members.

04:25:51.440 --> 04:25:54.880
Yes, and again, just kind of a procedural question

04:25:55.720 --> 04:25:59.120
on this, is the draft of findings

04:25:59.120 --> 04:26:03.560
to amend the motion that has been put on the floor,

04:26:03.560 --> 04:26:07.600
because we have a motion and a second,

04:26:07.600 --> 04:26:09.720
we haven't called for a vote on that yet,

04:26:09.720 --> 04:26:13.760
so I just want to be clear on the draft of findings

04:26:13.760 --> 04:26:14.720
that is taking place,

04:26:14.720 --> 04:26:17.160
is that to be included in the motion

04:26:17.160 --> 04:26:19.960
for us to continue to complete the vote,

04:26:19.960 --> 04:26:23.080
and then at that point, we would move forward,

04:26:23.120 --> 04:26:25.680
is that what we're doing?

04:26:27.320 --> 04:26:28.840
I would suggest that we have the vote

04:26:28.840 --> 04:26:31.240
and the findings at the same time,

04:26:31.240 --> 04:26:34.280
given that was an issue with the county

04:26:34.280 --> 04:26:35.920
as per your discussion.

04:26:35.920 --> 04:26:37.920
Again, Member Olken, if you have some language

04:26:37.920 --> 04:26:40.240
that you'd like to add about why,

04:26:40.240 --> 04:26:42.200
I mean, you've had, you've been,

04:26:42.200 --> 04:26:44.040
why you think there's been an abusive discretion

04:26:44.040 --> 04:26:46.880
in particular, I think now would be the time

04:26:46.880 --> 04:26:50.200
to propose that, or we're happy to take a break

04:26:50.200 --> 04:26:51.040
and look at it.

04:26:52.040 --> 04:26:55.200
I know we'll be losing some members if we take a break,

04:26:55.200 --> 04:26:56.200
I understand that.

04:26:56.200 --> 04:27:01.200
I can, I mean, well, I'm not persuaded

04:27:03.600 --> 04:27:07.080
that the county has satisfied the requirements of C7

04:27:07.080 --> 04:27:10.240
and provided evidence in the documentary record

04:27:10.240 --> 04:27:11.840
that the proposed charter schools

04:27:11.840 --> 04:27:15.200
would substantially undermine existing services

04:27:15.200 --> 04:27:17.120
and offerings.

04:27:17.120 --> 04:27:18.720
That's probably not quite the finding

04:27:18.720 --> 04:27:20.920
you're looking for though, right?

04:27:21.760 --> 04:27:22.880
So that is the finding, right?

04:27:22.880 --> 04:27:26.000
Yeah, I mean, I wanna make sure,

04:27:26.000 --> 04:27:31.000
I mean, additionally, the district's process

04:27:31.000 --> 04:27:33.800
was problematic in reviewing the findings.

04:27:33.800 --> 04:27:37.000
I believe the district also abused its discretion

04:27:37.000 --> 04:27:39.840
by failing to proceed in the manner required by law

04:27:39.840 --> 04:27:43.560
because it did not provide a fair and impartial process.

04:27:43.560 --> 04:27:46.800
Those are sort of my two key findings.

04:27:46.800 --> 04:27:51.560
I'm happy to add those into the motion

04:27:51.560 --> 04:27:53.120
if that feels sufficient.

04:27:55.120 --> 04:27:56.760
That makes sense to me.

04:27:56.760 --> 04:27:59.240
I think those are the two that I wrote down

04:27:59.240 --> 04:28:01.200
as potential findings.

04:28:01.200 --> 04:28:02.040
Okay.

04:28:02.040 --> 04:28:07.040
So we get first to simply go ahead with the vote

04:28:07.200 --> 04:28:11.400
if we could on those two grounds with those two findings.

04:28:16.840 --> 04:28:19.560
That is that the district did not hold

04:28:19.560 --> 04:28:21.920
a fair and impartial hearing process

04:28:21.920 --> 04:28:26.920
and that the county did not satisfy

04:28:27.320 --> 04:28:32.320
the level of evidence needed to demonstrate

04:28:33.160 --> 04:28:35.000
in its findings that the charter schools

04:28:35.000 --> 04:28:36.960
substantially undermine existing services,

04:28:36.960 --> 04:28:41.960
offerings or programs under C7, 47605 C7.

04:28:47.520 --> 04:28:52.520
With those amendments and clarification of findings,

04:28:53.560 --> 04:28:55.360
I would suggest we...

04:28:55.360 --> 04:28:57.160
Shall I remove that?

04:28:57.160 --> 04:29:01.240
Would you prefer, shall I remove with that entire language?

04:29:04.280 --> 04:29:06.000
Yes, why don't you read it one more time

04:29:06.000 --> 04:29:09.400
so everyone is fully clear what they're voting on?

04:29:09.400 --> 04:29:10.440
Okay.

04:29:10.440 --> 04:29:11.560
Yeah.

04:29:11.560 --> 04:29:15.600
I move that the state board reverse the determinations

04:29:15.600 --> 04:29:19.640
of the Napa Valley Unified School District Governing Board

04:29:19.640 --> 04:29:22.400
and the Napa County Board of Education

04:29:22.400 --> 04:29:25.560
to deny Mayacomis Charter Middle School

04:29:25.560 --> 04:29:29.520
based on our determination that an abuse of discretion

04:29:29.520 --> 04:29:32.760
occurred at both the district and county levels.

04:29:33.640 --> 04:29:35.720
At the county level,

04:29:35.720 --> 04:29:39.040
the county has not satisfied the requirements of C7

04:29:39.040 --> 04:29:42.200
and provided evidence in the documentary record

04:29:42.200 --> 04:29:43.960
that the proposed charter school

04:29:43.960 --> 04:29:46.680
would substantially undermine existing services,

04:29:46.680 --> 04:29:48.120
offerings or programs.

04:29:49.600 --> 04:29:52.840
And at the district,

04:29:52.840 --> 04:29:56.120
the district abused its discretion by failing to proceed

04:29:56.120 --> 04:29:58.360
in the manner required by law

04:29:58.360 --> 04:30:00.080
because it did not provide a fair

04:30:00.080 --> 04:30:01.800
and impartial hearing process.

04:30:07.280 --> 04:30:11.960
All right, with that motion now clarified,

04:30:11.960 --> 04:30:13.800
we still need a second for the motion.

04:30:19.840 --> 04:30:20.680
I will second.

04:30:22.680 --> 04:30:23.520
All right.

04:30:23.520 --> 04:30:25.960
And then I think we need another roll call vote.

04:30:25.960 --> 04:30:28.880
We have a question for the discussion.

04:30:28.880 --> 04:30:30.440
Member Yoshimoto.

04:30:30.440 --> 04:30:32.240
Before we vote, Board President,

04:30:32.240 --> 04:30:35.600
I just wanted to confirm that as,

04:30:35.600 --> 04:30:37.000
I'm gonna try to articulate this clearly,

04:30:37.000 --> 04:30:39.880
but as the state board hears this appeal,

04:30:41.960 --> 04:30:46.960
we were to affirm that abuse of discretion

04:30:49.800 --> 04:30:53.520
did not occur at one or the other,

04:30:53.520 --> 04:30:56.680
district, county or both, right?

04:30:56.680 --> 04:31:00.080
But it could have been that one of the entities

04:31:02.240 --> 04:31:05.840
had evidence of abuse of discretion and the other didn't,

04:31:05.840 --> 04:31:09.440
and that still would have been okay.

04:31:10.760 --> 04:31:11.720
Does that make sense?

04:31:12.360 --> 04:31:14.680
It is our opinion that you'll need to find

04:31:14.680 --> 04:31:16.560
an abuse of discretion at both the district

04:31:16.560 --> 04:31:18.200
and the county level,

04:31:18.200 --> 04:31:23.120
because otherwise since both of the determinations

04:31:23.120 --> 04:31:26.200
at each level are de novo,

04:31:26.200 --> 04:31:28.440
then if you determined that there was not

04:31:28.440 --> 04:31:30.040
an abuse of discretion at one,

04:31:30.040 --> 04:31:32.240
then the charter school did receive

04:31:32.240 --> 04:31:34.480
a fair and impartial hearing on the record.

04:31:34.480 --> 04:31:37.000
So I believe it is our interpretation

04:31:37.000 --> 04:31:39.640
that an abuse of discretion has to be at both levels,

04:31:39.640 --> 04:31:42.600
which is consistent with Member Olken's motion.

04:31:44.200 --> 04:31:45.040
Thank you.

04:31:45.040 --> 04:31:48.240
Then I'd just like to caution President Darling-Hammond

04:31:48.240 --> 04:31:49.520
that after this vote,

04:31:49.520 --> 04:31:53.280
then you'll need to call on the petitioner

04:31:53.280 --> 04:31:55.640
and ask them about the delegation of oversight.

04:31:59.720 --> 04:32:02.840
So we now have a motion and we have a second,

04:32:02.840 --> 04:32:05.240
and I think we need to call the roll call vote.

04:32:05.240 --> 04:32:08.240
President Darling-Hammond, it appears you may have a question

04:32:08.240 --> 04:32:10.920
for additional discussion of the motion.

04:32:10.920 --> 04:32:12.760
Oh, I'm sorry, Member Rodriguez.

04:32:12.760 --> 04:32:16.200
Yes, I just have a question about that first motion

04:32:16.200 --> 04:32:20.040
that was made, because it was seconded,

04:32:20.040 --> 04:32:22.760
and I don't think we called it back

04:32:22.760 --> 04:32:24.920
before a second motion was made

04:32:24.920 --> 04:32:28.120
and seconded by somebody else, if I'm not mistaken.

04:32:28.120 --> 04:32:30.760
So I'm not sure if we have to recall that first motion.

04:32:31.800 --> 04:32:34.920
And then I think we need to call the roll call vote

04:32:35.000 --> 04:32:38.040
and Member Olken, do you and Member McQuillan,

04:32:38.040 --> 04:32:40.200
do you agree to withdraw the first motion?

04:32:41.240 --> 04:32:42.520
I do.

04:32:42.520 --> 04:32:43.880
Agreed.

04:32:43.880 --> 04:32:44.720
Thank you.

04:32:45.920 --> 04:32:47.320
Thank you, Member Rodriguez.

04:32:48.400 --> 04:32:49.240
Thank you.

04:32:51.040 --> 04:32:53.080
Brooks, can you call the roll call vote?

04:32:54.320 --> 04:32:55.680
President Darling-Hammond.

04:32:57.520 --> 04:32:59.120
Aye.

04:32:59.120 --> 04:32:59.960
Member Escobedo.

04:33:01.120 --> 04:33:01.960
Aye.

04:33:02.840 --> 04:33:04.240
Vice President Clever-Woods.

04:33:05.280 --> 04:33:06.120
No.

04:33:06.880 --> 04:33:08.600
Member Lewis.

04:33:08.600 --> 04:33:09.440
No.

04:33:10.240 --> 04:33:11.080
Member McQuillan.

04:33:12.160 --> 04:33:13.000
Yes.

04:33:13.880 --> 04:33:14.720
Member Olken.

04:33:20.000 --> 04:33:20.840
Yes.

04:33:22.000 --> 04:33:23.280
Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

04:33:24.640 --> 04:33:25.480
No.

04:33:26.400 --> 04:33:27.640
Member Petillo-Brownson.

04:33:29.000 --> 04:33:29.840
Yes.

04:33:30.760 --> 04:33:31.600
Member Porter.

04:33:32.600 --> 04:33:33.440
Yes.

04:33:34.400 --> 04:33:35.320
Member Rodriguez.

04:33:36.680 --> 04:33:37.520
No.

04:33:38.480 --> 04:33:39.680
Member Yoshimoto-Towry.

04:33:40.880 --> 04:33:41.720
No.

04:33:45.360 --> 04:33:47.480
The motion passes by a vote of six to five.

04:33:50.880 --> 04:33:53.120
All right, I know this is very difficult

04:33:53.120 --> 04:33:56.320
and I do want to just make a statement

04:33:56.320 --> 04:33:58.240
about sort of future appeals

04:33:58.240 --> 04:34:01.360
because this is going to continue to be

04:34:01.360 --> 04:34:03.680
a challenging process and I appreciate

04:34:03.680 --> 04:34:06.120
the work that was done at the district level

04:34:06.120 --> 04:34:10.760
and the county level and all of the folks who called in.

04:34:10.760 --> 04:34:13.040
We will continue to consider allegations

04:34:13.040 --> 04:34:15.000
based on the entire administrative record

04:34:15.000 --> 04:34:16.480
and to assist us in that work,

04:34:16.480 --> 04:34:19.560
I would encourage petitioners, districts and counties

04:34:19.560 --> 04:34:21.800
to ensure that appeals brought to the state board

04:34:21.800 --> 04:34:25.520
provide the detail necessary for us to fully comprehend

04:34:25.520 --> 04:34:27.960
and meaningfully understand what transpired

04:34:27.960 --> 04:34:31.320
at the local level as reflected in the documentary record.

04:34:32.280 --> 04:34:33.640
And in the spirit of continuous improvement,

04:34:33.640 --> 04:34:35.840
I'd like to urge local authorizers

04:34:35.840 --> 04:34:38.600
to ensure that petitions receive an unbiased

04:34:38.600 --> 04:34:41.200
and impartial review so that the processes

04:34:41.200 --> 04:34:42.920
are conducted fairly and consistent

04:34:42.920 --> 04:34:45.120
with all legal requirements.

04:34:45.120 --> 04:34:48.920
Today's appeal was submitted before the July board meeting.

04:34:48.920 --> 04:34:50.960
That means the district, county and petitioner

04:34:50.960 --> 04:34:53.400
do not have the benefit of a prior model

04:34:53.400 --> 04:34:55.560
when submitting their documentation.

04:34:55.560 --> 04:34:58.160
Moving forward, the July and September appeals

04:34:58.160 --> 04:35:00.600
will provide an example drawn

04:35:00.640 --> 04:35:03.560
and an opportunity to examine our processes.

04:35:03.560 --> 04:35:05.800
The state board expects that petitioners, districts

04:35:05.800 --> 04:35:07.760
and counties will know and act

04:35:07.760 --> 04:35:10.200
within the requirements of law.

04:35:10.200 --> 04:35:12.080
And my expectation is that the state board

04:35:12.080 --> 04:35:14.720
will implement the law fairly and impartially,

04:35:14.720 --> 04:35:18.400
examine our own processes and continue to learn.

04:35:18.400 --> 04:35:22.000
And this is the same expectation we have, of course,

04:35:22.000 --> 04:35:24.960
for petitioners, local authorizers and the department.

04:35:24.960 --> 04:35:28.320
And I invite you to join us in this approach.

04:35:29.240 --> 04:35:34.000
And at this moment, I would actually like to get some

04:35:34.000 --> 04:35:39.000
guidance about the next steps that you're proposing, Judy.

04:35:40.720 --> 04:35:42.760
I think at this point, the law requires

04:35:42.760 --> 04:35:46.240
that you take action to delegate oversight

04:35:46.240 --> 04:35:48.160
to either the district or the county.

04:35:49.280 --> 04:35:52.840
They will become the chartering authority at that point.

04:35:52.840 --> 04:35:54.400
The law requires that we consult,

04:35:54.400 --> 04:35:56.720
that you consult with the petitioner.

04:35:56.720 --> 04:35:59.000
I think you can ask the petitioner now,

04:35:59.000 --> 04:36:02.640
they're still on the line, which entity

04:36:02.640 --> 04:36:05.800
that they would like to be the chartering authority.

04:36:05.800 --> 04:36:07.520
And if you'd like, that requires

04:36:07.520 --> 04:36:08.560
that you talk to the petitioner.

04:36:08.560 --> 04:36:10.520
As a courtesy, you can also talk to the district

04:36:10.520 --> 04:36:12.080
and the county if you'd like,

04:36:12.080 --> 04:36:14.760
but you need to talk to the petitioner by statute.

04:36:16.000 --> 04:36:18.120
And then you'll have to take a vote on that.

04:36:20.440 --> 04:36:22.800
All right, where is the petitioner?

04:36:27.040 --> 04:36:29.240
Who wants to speak for the petitioner?

04:36:31.560 --> 04:36:32.400
I can speak.

04:36:34.840 --> 04:36:37.000
So the petitioner's preference would be

04:36:37.000 --> 04:36:38.760
to have the County Office of Education

04:36:38.760 --> 04:36:40.200
be the oversight agency.

04:36:43.560 --> 04:36:46.760
And then we consult with the county?

04:36:49.440 --> 04:36:53.240
Or is that a decision that stands on you?

04:36:53.280 --> 04:36:55.560
Is that a decision that stands on you?

04:36:58.680 --> 04:37:00.520
You certainly are welcome to talk to the district

04:37:00.520 --> 04:37:02.080
and county if you would like.

04:37:07.920 --> 04:37:10.440
Well, I think we will ask the county

04:37:10.440 --> 04:37:12.840
if they will accept the obligation

04:37:12.840 --> 04:37:16.080
to manage the charter, oversee the charter.

04:37:18.640 --> 04:37:21.120
So I don't know, to be honest,

04:37:21.160 --> 04:37:22.800
that I have the authority to speak

04:37:22.800 --> 04:37:25.280
for the county superintendent of schools on this.

04:37:27.520 --> 04:37:29.320
It's my understanding we don't have a choice,

04:37:29.320 --> 04:37:34.320
but I would have to consult with the county superintendent

04:37:34.880 --> 04:37:37.040
to say that definitively about what we want.

04:37:38.200 --> 04:37:40.320
If I can just speak, I don't believe

04:37:40.320 --> 04:37:42.520
it would be the county superintendent of schools decision.

04:37:42.520 --> 04:37:43.720
I believe it would be the county board

04:37:43.720 --> 04:37:44.960
of education's decision,

04:37:44.960 --> 04:37:47.360
and they act as a board, not individually.

04:37:47.360 --> 04:37:51.120
So I would defer to the school district

04:37:51.120 --> 04:37:53.920
as to whether they prefer to authorize,

04:37:53.920 --> 04:37:55.440
and if they do not prefer,

04:37:55.440 --> 04:37:58.640
then the county board of education will take that on

04:37:58.640 --> 04:38:00.760
as required by the state part of education.

04:38:01.920 --> 04:38:04.040
If I may, the statute is clear what happens here.

04:38:04.040 --> 04:38:05.560
The statute says what you do.

04:38:09.120 --> 04:38:10.400
Excuse me, excuse me,

04:38:10.400 --> 04:38:12.640
but you weren't to recognize Mr. Lemmo, I'm sorry.

04:38:12.640 --> 04:38:14.360
I think we've been clear that the statute

04:38:14.360 --> 04:38:17.240
requires consultation with petitioner,

04:38:18.080 --> 04:38:19.320
which we've done, and as a courtesy,

04:38:19.320 --> 04:38:20.920
we're talking to the district and the county,

04:38:20.920 --> 04:38:22.560
but Ms. Nix is correct.

04:38:22.560 --> 04:38:24.560
There really isn't a choice here,

04:38:24.560 --> 04:38:27.520
but as a courtesy, we will talk to the other parties

04:38:27.520 --> 04:38:28.440
here on the line.

04:38:32.080 --> 04:38:33.760
Well, since there is no choice,

04:38:33.760 --> 04:38:36.200
we're courteously telling you

04:38:36.200 --> 04:38:38.880
that you will be overseeing the charter,

04:38:40.000 --> 04:38:41.720
saying that was great politeness.

04:38:44.440 --> 04:38:45.600
It is with great politeness,

04:38:45.680 --> 04:38:48.200
but I say, I will tell my client that, thank you.

04:38:51.800 --> 04:38:53.720
And you will need a motion on this.

04:38:53.720 --> 04:38:56.520
Make sure you note that it's courteous and polite.

04:39:00.160 --> 04:39:02.200
All right, I think that that is the end

04:39:02.200 --> 04:39:04.400
of our business then, is that right?

04:39:04.400 --> 04:39:05.600
You will need a motion.

04:39:05.600 --> 04:39:08.000
You'll need a motion on this, please, and a vote.

04:39:08.000 --> 04:39:08.840
Okay.

04:39:11.240 --> 04:39:14.600
If I get a motion as to the designation

04:39:14.600 --> 04:39:16.160
of the County Office of Education

04:39:16.160 --> 04:39:21.160
as the oversight agency for the charter.

04:39:27.760 --> 04:39:31.920
I move that the County Office of Education

04:39:31.920 --> 04:39:33.920
is the oversight agency for the charter.

04:39:36.080 --> 04:39:36.920
And the second?

04:39:40.680 --> 04:39:41.520
I'll second.

04:39:43.520 --> 04:39:44.360
Thank you.

04:39:45.280 --> 04:39:46.600
We need a roll call vote.

04:39:47.600 --> 04:39:48.800
President Darlin-Hammond.

04:39:50.800 --> 04:39:51.920
Aye.

04:39:51.920 --> 04:39:52.760
Member Escobedo.

04:39:53.800 --> 04:39:54.760
Aye.

04:39:54.760 --> 04:39:56.200
Vice President Glover-Woods.

04:39:57.360 --> 04:39:58.520
Yes.

04:39:58.520 --> 04:40:00.200
Member Lewis.

04:40:00.200 --> 04:40:01.440
Yes.

04:40:01.440 --> 04:40:02.280
Member McClellan.

04:40:03.360 --> 04:40:04.320
Yes.

04:40:04.320 --> 04:40:05.160
Member Olken.

04:40:06.000 --> 04:40:07.000
Yes.

04:40:07.000 --> 04:40:08.400
Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

04:40:10.160 --> 04:40:11.360
Yes.

04:40:11.360 --> 04:40:12.600
Member Patillo-Brownson.

04:40:13.560 --> 04:40:14.400
Yes.

04:40:15.400 --> 04:40:16.400
Member Porter.

04:40:16.400 --> 04:40:17.480
Yes.

04:40:17.480 --> 04:40:18.480
Member Rodriguez.

04:40:19.600 --> 04:40:20.920
Yes.

04:40:20.920 --> 04:40:22.160
Member Yoshimoto-Towry.

04:40:24.280 --> 04:40:25.480
Yes.

04:40:25.480 --> 04:40:26.320
Motion carries.

04:40:29.040 --> 04:40:29.880
Thank you very much.

04:40:29.880 --> 04:40:33.160
And I just want to thank the entire board,

04:40:33.160 --> 04:40:38.160
all of the petitioners and members of district

04:40:39.920 --> 04:40:41.920
and county offices and callers

04:40:41.920 --> 04:40:43.680
who have participated in this today.

04:40:43.680 --> 04:40:47.280
We know this is a challenging process,

04:40:47.280 --> 04:40:51.440
that it takes a lot of creativity

04:40:51.440 --> 04:40:56.440
to figure out where we are supposed to be paying attention.

04:40:56.600 --> 04:41:01.600
And we look forward to even more well-informed processes

04:41:03.080 --> 04:41:04.240
in the future.

04:41:04.240 --> 04:41:06.680
And I wish everybody a good rest of the day.

04:41:06.680 --> 04:41:10.480
This meeting is now adjourned at 1.30 p.m.

04:41:10.480 --> 04:41:11.320
Thank you.

04:41:13.320 --> 04:41:14.160
Thank you.

04:41:15.360 --> 04:41:16.200
Bye everyone.

04:41:17.960 --> 04:41:18.800
Bye.
