WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.620
Welcome. We are reconvening from closed session. In closed session the board discussed or took

00:13.620 --> 00:20.260
action on the following legal matters. Mirabelli versus Olson. And we have the public comment

00:20.260 --> 00:26.540
slide up for our waiver discussion. I'd like to take up the waiver consent items W1 through

00:26.540 --> 00:34.260
W11. We'll now open the phone line for the public comment queue. And the slide is displayed

00:34.260 --> 00:41.300
and we'll take a moment to see if there's any public comment coming in.

00:41.300 --> 00:50.780
If there's any public comment in the room, please line up at the microphone.

00:50.780 --> 00:57.220
We've given a little wait time. So hearing no, is there, there's nobody on the phone?

00:57.220 --> 01:06.140
No, there's no callers in the queue. Okay, wonderful. So after, since there's no further

01:06.140 --> 01:13.100
public comment, I'll ask for a motion on consent waivers one through 11. May I have a motion?

01:13.100 --> 01:20.020
Thank you. Vice President Glover-Woods, do I have a second? Member Olson. For all in

01:20.020 --> 01:29.700
favor please say aye. Aye. Any opposed say nay. Any abstentions? What are you doing over

01:29.700 --> 01:36.900
there?

01:36.900 --> 01:43.940
Motion carries. Thank you. Item 11 is the consideration of requests for determination

01:43.940 --> 01:48.600
of funding with reasonable basis mitigating circumstances as required for non-classroom

01:48.840 --> 01:58.320
charter schools pursuant to California Education Code sections 47612.5 and 47634.2 and associated

01:58.320 --> 02:04.240
California Code of Regulations Title V. The CDE recommends that we take the following

02:04.240 --> 02:08.800
actions on the charter schools mitigating circumstances requests and determination of

02:08.800 --> 02:14.600
funding requests. Approve the mitigation, mitigating circumstances requests and determination

02:14.600 --> 02:20.940
of funding requests at 100% for 20 charter schools as you can see in attachment one.

02:20.940 --> 02:25.560
Approve the mitigating circumstances requests and determination of funding requests at 85%

02:25.560 --> 02:32.120
for seven charter schools as specified in attachment one. And deny the mitigating circumstances

02:32.120 --> 02:35.960
requests and approve the determination of funding requests at the level for which they

02:35.960 --> 02:42.080
are qualified based on their reported expenditures for seven charter schools as shown in attachment

02:42.080 --> 02:47.520
one. And the item will be presented by Stephanie Farland and McKenna Huey of the CDE. Thank

02:47.520 --> 02:56.520
you very much. Thank you. Good morning. This item as board president Linda Darling-Hammond

02:56.520 --> 03:01.200
just stated includes a consideration of determination of funding requests with mitigating circumstances

03:01.200 --> 03:07.160
for 34 charter schools. The schools presented in this item do not meet the regulatory requirements

03:07.160 --> 03:12.040
to qualify for 100% funding for their non-classroom based instruction based on reported expenditures

03:12.120 --> 03:18.000
and the criteria outlined in California Code of Regulations Title V. 17 of these schools

03:18.000 --> 03:29.000
qualify for 85% funding, 13 qualify for 70% and four qualify for 0%. And just as an aside

03:29.000 --> 03:34.640
you on consent approved all of the other funding determination requests. We had almost 200

03:35.640 --> 03:42.800
at one time so this was a huge, huge lift for our staff to do it once it doesn't normally

03:42.800 --> 03:48.320
work out that way. Our recommendation today is the California Department of Education

03:48.320 --> 03:53.280
recommends that the state board take the following actions. Approve 20 charter schools funding

03:53.280 --> 03:59.880
determination at 100%, approve seven at 85% and approve seven charter schools funding

03:59.880 --> 04:04.360
determinations at the level of funding for which they qualify to receive. At its April

04:04.360 --> 04:09.080
18, 2023 meeting the advisory commission on charter schools move to recommend that

04:09.080 --> 04:14.400
the SBE approve all schools funding determinations at 100% for two years. That motion passed

04:14.400 --> 04:21.400
by a vote of six to two. And then to give you the background and go over the item in

04:21.400 --> 04:28.400
more detail I passed it off to McKenna Huey. Good morning President Darling-Hammond, Vice

04:30.480 --> 04:34.280
President Glover Woods and members of the state board. As Stephanie Farlin just said

04:34.280 --> 04:38.240
my name is McKenna Huey and I'm a manager in the charter schools division. I'm going

04:38.240 --> 04:44.320
to provide a little bit of background about the funding determination process. So pursuant

04:44.320 --> 04:51.320
to California Education Code section 47612.5 a charter school may receive funding for its

04:51.320 --> 04:56.360
non classroom based instruction only if a determination of funding is made by the state

04:56.360 --> 05:01.720
board. If a charter school's total average daily attendance is less than 80% classroom

05:01.720 --> 05:06.960
based it must obtain a determination of funding from the board in order to receive funding

05:06.960 --> 05:13.960
for its non classroom based instruction. So Senate Bill 820 which was signed by the governor

05:15.160 --> 05:21.240
in September of 2020 made changes to the funding determination process for fiscal years 2020

05:21.240 --> 05:27.040
and 2021 through 2021-22 and this impacted charter schools that had an active funding

05:27.040 --> 05:34.040
determination that expired on June 30th of 2021 and 2022. So specifically this bill extended

05:35.280 --> 05:39.320
the deadline for non classroom based charter schools to submit a funding determination

05:39.320 --> 05:46.320
renewal quest from February 1st to June 30th. Pursuant to this bill non classroom based charter

05:46.480 --> 05:51.420
schools that submitted a complete funding determination request by the June 30th deadline

05:51.420 --> 05:55.960
received their current level of funding for two years and these funding determination

05:55.960 --> 06:01.560
requests did not require approval from the state board. So the department worked very

06:01.560 --> 06:06.240
closely with those charter schools who were impacted by Senate Bill 820 to ensure that

06:06.240 --> 06:11.760
all charter schools submitted a complete funding determination request by the deadline. So

06:11.760 --> 06:16.560
for both fiscal years all schools who were required to submit by June 30th submitted

06:16.560 --> 06:20.480
by that date and therefore received their current level of funding for two additional

06:20.480 --> 06:27.480
years. Due to the impact of this bill on the funding determination process for the last

06:28.200 --> 06:33.240
couple of fiscal years the advisory commission on charter schools as well as the state board

06:33.240 --> 06:39.200
have heard significantly fewer funding determination requests than in previous years. However as

06:39.320 --> 06:45.160
this bill does not apply for fiscal years 2022, 2023 and beyond the department anticipates

06:45.160 --> 06:49.800
that the state board will return to hearing a large volume of funding determination requests

06:49.800 --> 06:56.800
particularly at the main meeting and as Stephanie Farlin just said we had over 200 or close

06:56.920 --> 07:03.920
to 200 requests that we processed this year. So as stated in this item education code section

07:04.920 --> 07:11.920
47634.3 provides that regulations shall specify that a non-classroom based instruction is

07:13.920 --> 07:18.920
conducted for the instructional benefit of pupils and is substantially dedicated to that

07:18.920 --> 07:23.920
function. So in determining the amount of funding to be allocated to a charter school

07:23.920 --> 07:28.920
for its non-classroom based instruction the state board shall consider among other factors

07:29.760 --> 07:35.040
it deems appropriate the amount of the charter schools total budget expended on certificate

07:35.040 --> 07:40.280
employee salaries and benefits and on school sites as well as the teacher to pupil ratio

07:40.280 --> 07:47.280
of the school. This section also states that for the 2003-2004 fiscal year and each fiscal

07:47.520 --> 07:53.720
year thereafter the amount of funding determined by the state board shall be no more than 70%

07:53.720 --> 07:57.960
of the unadjusted amount to which a charter school would otherwise be entitled unless

07:58.040 --> 08:02.520
the state board determines that a greater or lesser amount is appropriate based on the

08:02.520 --> 08:09.520
criteria outlined in education code.

08:09.520 --> 08:14.960
So regulations specify and outline the eligibility requirements for specific levels of funding

08:14.960 --> 08:20.840
for charter schools offering non-classroom based instruction. So as illustrated on the

08:20.840 --> 08:27.840
table on this slide the requirements to qualify for a recommendation for 100% funding are

08:28.160 --> 08:35.160
for non-classroom based instruction is charter schools spending 40% of their public revenues

08:36.440 --> 08:41.800
on certificate salaries and benefits, 80% of their total revenues on instruction related

08:41.800 --> 08:48.800
services and maintain a pupil to teacher ratio of 25 to 1.

08:49.560 --> 08:53.720
For charter schools that do not meet the requirements and criteria for their requested level of

08:53.720 --> 08:59.720
funding regulation states that a reasonable basis also referred to as a mitigating circumstance

08:59.720 --> 09:04.400
by which to make an other recommendation in order to allow a non-classroom based charter

09:04.400 --> 09:09.900
school to receive a higher percentage of funding than it qualifies for based on its expenditures

09:09.900 --> 09:14.640
may be found.

09:14.640 --> 09:20.760
So getting into the actual item now as previously stated this item considers determination of

09:20.800 --> 09:25.640
funding requests for 34 charter schools. All of these charter schools fail to meet the

09:25.640 --> 09:32.640
requirements to qualify for 100% funding for their non-classroom based instruction.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.720
When considering mitigating circumstances the department is guided by regulations section

09:39.720 --> 09:46.720
1196.3.4E and considers the unique or exceptional circumstances of the charter school. This

09:47.240 --> 09:52.120
section of regulations provides specific instances for which mitigating circumstances may be

09:52.120 --> 09:57.760
considered which include but are not limited to information provided by the school on its

09:57.760 --> 10:02.560
funding determination form, documented data regarding individual circumstances of the

10:02.560 --> 10:07.040
charter school, the size of the charter school and the number of years a charter school has

10:07.040 --> 10:09.440
been in operation.

10:09.440 --> 10:14.520
This section also states that serious consideration of full funding shall be given to charter

10:14.600 --> 10:20.080
schools with less than a total of 100 units of prior year second period average daily

10:20.080 --> 10:26.920
attendance and charter schools that are in their first year of operation.

10:26.920 --> 10:33.920
California code of regulations title 5 section 1196.3.4B permits the department to ask charter

10:34.080 --> 10:38.400
schools for additional information in order to make possible a more detailed review or

10:38.400 --> 10:44.360
to develop a reasonable basis for a recommendation other than those prescribed by regulations.

10:44.360 --> 10:49.560
Pursuant to this section the department requests and considers additional information of charter

10:49.560 --> 10:54.680
schools which may include but again is not limited to charter schools excess reserves

10:54.680 --> 11:01.680
as well as their previous requests for the consideration of mitigating circumstances.

11:03.600 --> 11:08.600
With specific regard to a charter schools excess reserves regulations state that reserves

11:08.640 --> 11:15.640
in excess of the greater of $50,000 or 5% of total expenditures may be allowed for economic

11:16.400 --> 11:21.880
uncertainties or long-term expenditures such as capital projects if the excess reserves

11:21.880 --> 11:24.920
are satisfactorily explained.

11:24.920 --> 11:29.080
Pursuant to this section during the consideration of requests for mitigating circumstances the

11:29.080 --> 11:34.600
department does ask for additional information of charter schools excess reserves and the

11:34.600 --> 11:38.120
department's review and consideration of that additional information is limited to

11:38.120 --> 11:45.440
what is provided by the charter schools.

11:45.440 --> 11:49.120
Pursuant to regulations the funding period for an existing non-classroom based charter

11:49.120 --> 11:53.680
school shall be for a minimum of two years and a maximum of five years in length.

11:53.680 --> 11:58.480
As outlined in statute five year periods are dependent on a charter schools academic performance

11:58.480 --> 12:04.000
index rate however because API is no longer calculated the department does not currently

12:04.000 --> 12:06.720
recommend five year periods.

12:06.720 --> 12:10.840
For charter schools requesting the consideration of mitigating circumstances it is the department's

12:10.840 --> 12:16.400
practice to recommend funding periods of two years and this allows the department to timely

12:16.400 --> 12:20.760
revisit schools funding determinations and ensure that they are meeting the requirements

12:20.760 --> 12:27.680
outlined in regulations for approved level of funding.

12:27.680 --> 12:31.680
Schools whose funding determinations are approved at a level different than what is requested

12:31.720 --> 12:38.480
may submit a funding determination reconsideration request pursuant to regulations.

12:38.480 --> 12:43.080
Pursuant to this section a school that wishes to seek a higher or lower determination of

12:43.080 --> 12:48.640
funding shall do so by filing a new determination of funding request during the effective period

12:48.640 --> 12:54.120
of their funding determination and if approved by the state board that would replace their

12:54.120 --> 13:00.200
funding determination that is then in effect.

13:00.200 --> 13:03.800
Based on its review of the charter schools reported expenditures and in alignment with

13:03.800 --> 13:08.480
the requirements outlined in regulations the department recommends that the state board

13:08.480 --> 13:14.880
approve 20 schools funding determination requests at 100% which is a higher level of funding

13:14.880 --> 13:17.280
than for which they qualify.

13:17.280 --> 13:22.840
Approve seven charter schools funding determination requests at 85% which again is a higher level

13:22.840 --> 13:26.000
of funding than for which they qualify.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.640
Approve seven charter schools funding determinations at the level of funding for which they qualify

13:30.640 --> 13:36.000
to receive based on their expenditures and regulations and to clarify the department

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
is not proposing that these schools have their funding cut or that these schools receive

13:41.000 --> 13:45.760
no funding for their non-classing based instruction rather the department is recommending that

13:45.760 --> 13:50.320
the state board approve these schools funding determinations at the level for which they

13:50.320 --> 13:53.960
qualify to receive pursuant to regulations.

13:53.960 --> 14:04.400
Thank you for your consideration of this item I'm happy to answer any questions.

14:04.400 --> 14:09.400
So at this point I want to ask our liaisons Vice President Glover-Woods and member Olken

14:09.400 --> 14:14.440
if they have any initial comments while we're putting up the public comment slide could

14:14.440 --> 14:18.320
you go ahead and put that up great.

14:18.320 --> 14:23.400
So if there are comments to be called in please use the number and the participant access

14:23.400 --> 14:29.720
code on this slide and Vice President Glover-Woods will you start us off.

14:29.720 --> 14:38.200
I'm actually going to have member Olken start us off and I will follow her if that is okay.

14:38.200 --> 14:40.500
Thank you.

14:40.500 --> 14:49.020
So first I just want to point out that you both mentioned the incredible amount of information

14:49.020 --> 14:55.820
you had to review for this item and having tried to keep up with it myself I just want

14:55.820 --> 15:05.100
to thank you for how much you looked at and reviewed it was an incredible volume of information

15:05.100 --> 15:11.180
and as the course of this between ACCS and now there's been new information that's been

15:11.180 --> 15:16.620
presented and they kept going back so I just want to thank you for that too.

15:16.660 --> 15:23.260
And then just for us what you heard was that we are considering two different recommendations

15:23.260 --> 15:28.620
there's the recommendation coming from the department which is outlined in the item and

15:28.620 --> 15:34.300
then at the advisory commission on charter schools there was a different recommendation

15:34.300 --> 15:44.980
which is also outlined in the slides and there was quite a bit of discussion about this item

15:45.460 --> 15:53.220
the mitigating circumstances are basically related to arguments about pandemic effect

15:53.220 --> 15:56.900
and one-time funding and how that plays out for schools as they're trying to determine

15:56.900 --> 16:00.660
their budgets so it really was a meaty conversation and I'm sure we're going to hear

16:00.660 --> 16:04.900
a lot about it in public comment so and I'll save the rest for later thank you.

16:04.900 --> 16:15.940
And I will just add to member Olkins comments by stating what was we just saw in the conclusion

16:15.940 --> 16:22.980
and recommendation chart just again to re-emphasize that this item is not bringing forward no funding

16:24.340 --> 16:29.940
all of the charter schools would what is being recommended is that they either receive the funding

16:30.420 --> 16:36.180
determination at the level for which they are qualified to receive or above that particular

16:36.180 --> 16:44.420
level and so I just want to underscore that as well as underscoring there is opportunity as was

16:44.420 --> 16:52.740
shared in one of our previous slides for any school that receives a funding determination

16:53.380 --> 16:59.940
at a level that they are that they qualify for but they feel they should receive more

16:59.940 --> 17:08.180
they do have opportunity to come back and request an additional consideration for additional funding

17:08.180 --> 17:12.980
so again just wanted to underscore those two points as we get ready to go into public comment.

17:16.180 --> 17:21.460
So I guess we want to see first if there's any public comment in the room

17:23.540 --> 17:26.900
will the following individuals please line up at the microphone

17:26.900 --> 17:35.620
Cynthia Rachel, Nicholas Watson, Heidi Gasca, Joe Cerreira, Eric Premack, Jeff Rice and Bill Dodson.

17:52.740 --> 17:58.500
I think you can go ahead please state your name and affiliation for the record.

18:05.540 --> 18:10.820
Please be sure the microphone is on. Is it better now? Better yeah thank you. My name is

18:10.820 --> 18:15.380
Cynthia Rachel and I'm representing South Sutter and Sky Mountain charter schools. Our schools have

18:15.380 --> 18:21.860
a track record of clean audits, fiscal solvency and 100 funding determinations for more than 15

18:21.860 --> 18:27.860
years. I'm concerned that the recommendations by made by the ACCS are not the ones that were

18:27.860 --> 18:33.140
presented as the formal recommendation for your review today. There are now new recommendations

18:33.140 --> 18:38.900
that are not following the regulatory process outlined by SB 740. This discrepancy has caused

18:38.900 --> 18:45.140
significant distress to our schools as well as all mentioned in item 11. We were encouraged by

18:45.140 --> 18:51.940
ACCS's recognition of the one-time unique and exceptional circumstances that all schools in

18:51.940 --> 18:57.140
California have faced over the past three years which prevented us from meeting the usual funding

18:57.140 --> 19:03.540
thresholds. The ACCS's recommendation offers a fair and just solution for our schools considering

19:03.540 --> 19:09.060
these exceptional circumstances. Please support the ACCS's recommendation. Thank you.

19:15.220 --> 19:21.300
Hello my name is Heidi Gasca. I'm the executive director for Excel Academy charter school.

19:21.300 --> 19:25.620
I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for the extraordinary one-time circumstances brought

19:25.620 --> 19:30.820
about by the COVID pandemic. The tremendous uncertainty and fear and doubt was not a time

19:30.820 --> 19:35.860
conducive to make haste decisions in regards to budgeting. As a steward of public funds I was

19:35.860 --> 19:40.740
committed to be prudent during in the budgeting process. In fact the timing of the required SB

19:40.740 --> 19:45.140
740 filing artificially inflated our reserves and the reality is we did not have access to

19:45.140 --> 19:51.940
the necessary funds during the course of the 21-22 school year. Excel Academy fell above the 40%

19:51.940 --> 19:58.340
and just 3% below the 80% target. I want to make sure that you are aware that Excel Academy was

19:58.340 --> 20:03.860
just one of 11 non-classroom based charter schools that was named a 2023 California distinguished

20:03.860 --> 20:09.300
school. In fact we were the only school to be given this honor in the entire high desert.

20:09.300 --> 20:12.260
We would like to continue to educate students who attend one of the top

20:12.260 --> 20:17.060
356 schools in California. Acknowledge for closing the achievement gap and

20:17.060 --> 20:19.300
achieving exceptional student performance.

20:26.100 --> 20:31.940
Good morning board president Dr. Doldrum and board members. Thank you for the opportunity

20:31.940 --> 20:36.820
that to speak with you today. My name is Joe Sarara from Excel Academy charter school. One

20:36.820 --> 20:42.660
of the distinguished schools selected in 2023. The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant

20:42.660 --> 20:47.460
challenges for our school this year and last in the last two years. In the last fiscal year we

20:47.460 --> 20:53.700
faced financial difficulties due to unforeseen events because of the influx of students that

20:53.700 --> 21:00.660
chose our schools but we couldn't claim funding for those because of SB 579. We also receive

21:00.820 --> 21:07.700
$290,000 in PPP program which later forgiven which impacted our SB 740 calculation

21:08.500 --> 21:14.100
and artificially inflated our reserve. So in conclusion I express my sincerest gratitude

21:14.100 --> 21:19.860
for the opportunity to address the state board of education and shed light in on our circumstances.

21:19.860 --> 21:25.380
I strongly urge the state board of education to accept the recommendation from ACCCS

21:25.860 --> 21:29.860
and approve 100% funding for Excel Academy charter school. Thank you.

21:36.340 --> 21:42.260
Good morning my name is Bill Dobson and I'm the director at Motivated Youth Academy. Motivated

21:42.260 --> 21:48.500
Youth Academy has an enrollment of 251 students and has been a dashboard alternative school status

21:48.500 --> 21:56.660
community of practice since July 2019. Our school is one of only three dot schools in our service

21:56.660 --> 22:02.180
area that is primarily virtual meaning students get the benefit of both in-person support from

22:02.180 --> 22:08.500
a credentialed teacher as well as the flexibility of virtual program offers. Our teachers go into

22:08.500 --> 22:13.940
the communities where students live and meet with them weekly at public locations such as libraries,

22:13.940 --> 22:20.260
community centers, and tribal halls. Our focus is on creating equitable access to consistently

22:20.260 --> 22:26.260
strong outcomes for all students paying special attention to the social emotional needs of

22:26.260 --> 22:32.580
historically marginalized populations. I urge you to recommend 100% full funding for Motivated Youth

22:32.580 --> 22:38.980
Academy so the at-promise and opportunity youth we serve continue to have equitable access to

22:38.980 --> 22:43.300
public education and the opportunity to earn a high school diploma. Thank you.

22:49.380 --> 22:52.420
Morning members of the board. Nicholas Watson speaking on behalf of the California

22:52.980 --> 22:57.700
Charter Schools Association. I just wanted to thank CDE staff. I know that it took a tremendous

22:57.700 --> 23:03.140
amount of work to review all these materials and then we just wanted to say we support

23:03.780 --> 23:09.140
full funding determinations for all these schools consistent with the ACCS recommendation. Thank you.

23:12.980 --> 23:17.620
Good morning. Jeff Rice with the A plus personalized learning network association. I want

23:17.620 --> 23:23.380
to commend the ACCS's wisdom and compassion in recommending 100% funding for two years

23:23.380 --> 23:28.180
for all 34 charter schools having to rely on mitigating circumstances and urge you to

23:28.180 --> 23:33.460
approve the ACCS recommendation as well to allow these schools time to return to normal

23:33.460 --> 23:39.460
post-pandemic operations without undermining their funding stability. It is critically important to

23:39.460 --> 23:45.140
recognize and acknowledge the COVID pandemic as the most extreme and extraordinary mitigating

23:45.140 --> 23:51.620
circumstance in our lifetime as ample justification to grant all these schools 100% funding for two

23:51.620 --> 23:57.780
years. Fiscal year 21-22 is the first year coming out of the eye of the pandemic storm was dominated

23:57.780 --> 24:03.700
by continuing fear, uncertainty, and doubt about a very unclear future not to mention extreme

24:03.700 --> 24:08.580
challenges around teacher shortages, chronic student absences, mental health issues, and more

24:08.580 --> 24:14.500
all beyond the control of any school administration. It was not a climate conducive to a return to

24:14.500 --> 24:20.820
normal operations yet nor to engage in major spending commitments but instead require

24:20.820 --> 24:26.980
prudent and responsible measures internally to ensure higher than normal reserves to maintain

24:26.980 --> 24:31.220
stability. I urge you to approve the recommendation of the ACCS. Thank you.

24:35.220 --> 24:39.620
Good morning. Eric Premack with the Charter Schools Development Center here in support of

24:39.620 --> 24:46.260
the ACCS recommendation for full funding. The law here is poorly drafted and folks can read it in

24:46.260 --> 24:51.620
different ways. I was a party to the negotiations roughly 20 years ago that led to the creation of

24:51.620 --> 24:58.020
this law and we had long discussions with the governor at the time Gray Davis and he shared some

24:58.020 --> 25:02.740
of our concerns about the law and when he signed it he wrote a signing message that went along with

25:02.740 --> 25:07.860
it and you can download it from his archives and he said because I have some concern that this bill

25:07.860 --> 25:13.220
could be administered in an overly broad fashion I'm requesting the state board of education to

25:13.220 --> 25:19.220
regulate and administer the provisions of this act in a manner to affect only those charter schools

25:19.220 --> 25:25.460
who spend excessively on administration and profit. None of the schools before you today

25:25.460 --> 25:31.060
do we have evidence of excessive spending on administration nor profit. All of them have

25:31.060 --> 25:38.340
submitted perfectly valid reasons for mitigation, standard practices that all school districts and

25:38.340 --> 25:45.380
charter schools routinely engage in and I hope that you will support the ACCS recommendation. Thank you.

25:49.540 --> 25:55.220
And we do not have any callers in the queue so that concludes public comment for item number 11.

26:01.060 --> 26:07.540
Okay at this point I think we're open for board discussion and questions so

26:09.140 --> 26:17.220
let's kick that off. I do have a question which is and maybe our liaisons can

26:17.220 --> 26:27.060
help and or our CDE colleague can help. Can you articulate for me why the ACCS recommendations

26:27.060 --> 26:36.100
were not adopted? Could you mind just start us off with that? Sorry to clarify you're asking

26:36.100 --> 26:46.980
why the CDE did not adopt the ACCS's recommendation? The CDE just upon its analysis of all the

26:46.980 --> 26:51.060
school's funding determination requests and mitigating circumstances we feel that our

26:51.060 --> 26:58.020
recommendation is appropriate and what the school is qualified for. We did take mitigating circumstances

26:58.020 --> 27:03.140
into consideration and as you'll see on the item and in our analysis we do acknowledge that.

27:03.860 --> 27:12.580
There were other considerations though that led us to recommend other levels of funding that

27:12.580 --> 27:15.700
they would receive so 85 percent or 70 percent.

27:18.820 --> 27:22.180
So then I want to know what the other considerations were that would

27:23.060 --> 27:28.100
sort of push aside the mitigating circumstances. Okay and those were also outlined in the item.

27:28.660 --> 27:34.820
A lot of the things that we or the other things that we considered were the charter school's

27:34.820 --> 27:43.060
reserves. Regulations does state that a charter school may have more than five percent in reserves

27:43.060 --> 27:48.340
if they are satisfactorily explained. We did ask for more information of those charter schools who

27:48.340 --> 27:53.940
had very large reserves and as you'll see they ranged anywhere from 20 percent to 80 percent to

27:53.940 --> 28:02.020
100 percent of their total expenditures and so we did ask for that information. If we felt that

28:02.020 --> 28:08.500
their responses were not satisfactory again we made our recommendation as we felt was appropriate.

28:11.140 --> 28:18.980
Are you yes Vice President Glover Woods. I just had a follow-up question. As it relates to one

28:19.060 --> 28:25.700
time funding that has been received and how was that taken into consideration

28:26.340 --> 28:31.380
with reserves and with the impact it would have on the percentages that are required.

28:31.940 --> 28:38.100
Absolutely and that is something that we considered as well. A part of our recommendations were

28:38.900 --> 28:45.140
we came to our recommendations because if we excluded those one-time funds from the school's

28:45.140 --> 28:49.540
calculations they still would not meet the requirements to qualify for a recommendation

28:49.540 --> 28:55.380
of 100 percent funding. So in cases where those one-time funds did impact their ability to meet

28:56.020 --> 29:02.580
or qualify for meet those requirements again we did find that to be a mitigating circumstance

29:02.580 --> 29:07.300
but in situations where had that one-time funding been excluded and they still would have not met

29:07.300 --> 29:12.580
the requirements we made a recommendation as we felt was in alignment with regulations.

29:16.100 --> 29:21.220
I just wanted to provide one more piece of information for your question.

29:22.580 --> 29:30.260
There were and if I get this wrong please feel free to correct me. There were two schools

29:30.260 --> 29:39.780
who CDE did change their recommendation for between ACCS and now so upon further review

29:39.780 --> 29:45.860
they changed their recommendation to full funding so there and that was based on more

29:45.860 --> 29:56.340
information that came in and that's correct right excellent and then my reading of the

29:57.460 --> 30:05.300
recommendations for less than full funding was almost in most cases it was based on the

30:05.540 --> 30:16.820
what schools said their reserves would be used for and why or didn't and

30:18.820 --> 30:23.460
so that's just trying to answer your question and then it can I go on to a comment then?

30:23.460 --> 30:37.220
Okay thanks and then in as I sort of dug into this what I sort of what what stood out to me was

30:38.740 --> 30:45.780
the schools who I mean first of all there were so many schools and it was a lot because of the

30:45.940 --> 30:53.620
the gap in doing these in doing these funding determinations and during that gap

30:54.660 --> 31:01.220
that was when we were in the depths of uncertainty related to the pandemic and

31:01.220 --> 31:08.340
that was both about how many students schools had some of these schools their enrollment dropped

31:08.340 --> 31:12.660
some of these schools their enrollment actually increased substantially but because of the hold

31:12.660 --> 31:17.300
harmless legislation they didn't receive increased funding for those students so they

31:17.300 --> 31:23.540
were actually educating more students with the same per pupil funding and there was also the

31:23.540 --> 31:32.660
time period in which what schools could expect to see in terms of state funding whether it was

31:32.660 --> 31:39.460
one-time funding ongoing funding categorical funding things it was really unclear at the

31:39.460 --> 31:46.260
time of budget decision making and so the position I think these schools are in is

31:48.260 --> 32:01.300
their funding going forward is dependent upon their previous year's budget revenue and expenses

32:01.700 --> 32:10.180
and so trying to fit within the sort of funding formula was particularly complicated

32:11.140 --> 32:17.620
in this time of great uncertainty and so I think when the schools requested mitigating circumstances

32:19.140 --> 32:25.540
that's what it was about right it was like this is what instead of continuing to instead of

32:26.100 --> 32:29.860
decreasing the amount of per pupil funding we're going to have in the future based on the

32:29.860 --> 32:34.980
future based on the uncertainty of the last couple years they're requesting that their funding stays

32:34.980 --> 32:42.740
the same and to me that's sort of the the crux of the issue and it was also really the crux of the

32:42.740 --> 32:53.540
conversation at the accs where the cd is carefully and and conscientiously reviewing information that

32:53.540 --> 32:58.580
came in and the schools are also trying to figure out how to continue to do right by their kids

33:00.020 --> 33:02.340
coming out of a really uncertain time

33:06.260 --> 33:13.300
Any Vice President Glover-Woods? We're going back and forth here I just want to

33:14.100 --> 33:20.820
shape into context I believe what is in front of us in this particular item and and please again

33:21.380 --> 33:29.220
McKenna correct me if I'm incorrect we're looking at our 14 schools that have not

33:29.220 --> 33:36.900
in this particular item been recommended for 100% funding and just to underscore the conversation

33:38.100 --> 33:44.340
that took place at the accs meeting the commissioners at the meeting those who

33:44.340 --> 33:53.380
voted in the affirmative to go with 100% funding for two years felt that the impact of the pandemic

33:53.380 --> 33:58.420
the impact of one-time funds the impact of many of these different things that we could have never

33:58.420 --> 34:08.660
anticipated has directly impacted the schools and what and the mitigating circumstances that

34:08.660 --> 34:15.540
they have submitted for so again just trying to stick with the context of what we're looking at

34:16.180 --> 34:24.100
and we have 14 schools that are being presented before us to be recommended at a level lower

34:24.660 --> 34:31.780
than the 100% two-year full funding even though they're being recommended at the level of funding

34:31.780 --> 34:39.620
for which they qualify I do have one question as I went into that long dissertation and I apologize

34:40.660 --> 34:51.220
one question for the 14 schools that we're considering not 100% funding for the two years

34:51.380 --> 35:01.060
are any of those schools in a sense of going to receive less funding than they previously had

35:02.420 --> 35:07.140
because of the mitigating circumstance funding determination they've submitted now

35:09.140 --> 35:15.700
that is that sorry can is the microphone working um that is a possibility I don't have that

35:16.660 --> 35:22.180
historical information on me right now so I can't give you kind of that side by side of all the

35:22.180 --> 35:27.460
schools and what they previously had but that definitely is a possibility as stated in a

35:27.460 --> 35:32.260
previous slide again schools can submit every consideration request if they receive a different

35:32.260 --> 35:36.740
level of funding them for which they qualified for and I'd also like to go back to something

35:36.740 --> 35:42.180
that member Olken that you stated so you spoke a lot about the circumstances of COVID and the

35:42.180 --> 35:47.300
one-time funding in the pandemic and just to clarify the CDE did take those things into

35:47.300 --> 35:51.460
consideration you'll see that in the item as well as in our analysis for each school

35:51.460 --> 35:56.660
there were other factors outside of those circumstances that guided us to our other

35:56.660 --> 36:00.980
recommendation that wasn't 100% funding for their non-classroom based instruction

36:05.940 --> 36:09.140
I was just going to clarify that there are definitely some schools we heard in public

36:09.140 --> 36:16.740
comment who they would receive less they have received 100% funding previously and the

36:16.740 --> 36:22.740
recommendation is to receive less than 100% currently so just to answer that your question

36:25.460 --> 36:27.300
are there other questions or comments

36:32.100 --> 36:35.380
clarifying question there's a school that spends more than 100%

36:35.380 --> 36:42.500
percent on certificated staff compensation how does that happen

36:47.540 --> 36:53.060
so in terms of calculating percent is spent on certificated salaries and benefits

36:53.940 --> 37:01.540
that is looked at based on a school's public revenues and I instruction related services

37:01.540 --> 37:03.700
are based on total revenues

37:13.220 --> 37:14.900
any other comments or questions

37:17.460 --> 37:19.060
do I have a motion

37:23.140 --> 37:24.900
is there more deliberation needed

37:24.900 --> 37:35.780
that's okay just based on something you just said and the question

37:36.900 --> 37:46.500
vice president clever woods asked so some schools may receive less funding and you're funding them

37:47.060 --> 37:54.580
at what they qualified for so the less funding would mean difficulty going forward is that

37:54.580 --> 38:00.660
what your intent is your intent with the concern about the reserves your intent is that they use

38:00.660 --> 38:06.100
the reserves going forward if they use less funding or what is the intent that what is the

38:06.980 --> 38:12.260
nexus between the reserves and the lack of of lower funding than what they received before

38:12.260 --> 38:19.860
if that makes sense I think I understand so there is no intent to cut these schools fundings again

38:19.860 --> 38:25.620
we are guided by regulations and based on the expenditures that these schools reported to us

38:25.620 --> 38:30.420
this is what they qualify to receive for their non-classroom based instruction again pursuant

38:30.420 --> 38:45.620
to regulations okay so again just to kind of form context for the motion and for the decision that

38:45.620 --> 38:53.140
the board will need to make we have CDE's recommendation that outlines as we see on

38:53.140 --> 39:02.020
the slide before us and then the ACCS has in a sense recommended that the state board consider

39:02.740 --> 39:09.300
providing 100 funding for two years for all of the schools in this particular item

39:09.780 --> 39:16.100
um as a result of a lot of the different things that have been talked about so that's what I see

39:16.100 --> 39:25.300
as the two points before us at right now and don't know if there's more conversation about

39:25.300 --> 39:30.580
those two options or how we want to move forward from there

39:31.140 --> 39:37.140
Member Olken you're you were leaning in you are our liaison so we rely to you we rely on you

39:39.140 --> 39:46.580
I mean I'm I'm prepared to make a motion um and I guess we can I mean my my the motion I would

39:46.580 --> 39:54.420
I would like to make is that we um approve these schools at 100 funding all of them for two years

39:54.420 --> 39:59.620
at 100 funding all of them for two years as recommended by the ACCS

40:01.860 --> 40:03.700
and do I have a second for that motion

40:06.580 --> 40:12.660
I'll second it but we're weighing and balancing here is the mitigating circumstances and the

40:12.660 --> 40:18.180
regulations which were enacted when there weren't mitigating circumstances and how do we weigh and

40:18.180 --> 40:23.700
balance those two things and we appreciate that it puts the department and everyone else into a

40:23.700 --> 40:28.900
very complicated situation so we have a motion and we have a second is there any further discussion

40:28.900 --> 40:38.900
of the motion uh yes member Yoshimoto Tari I just wanted you to clarify the timeline for appeals

40:38.900 --> 40:45.860
should um the current motion on the table not pass what's the process for appeals

40:47.700 --> 40:52.100
so a charter school may submit a reconsideration of their funding determination and they would do

40:52.100 --> 40:59.860
that during the period that their funding determination that they want to be reconsidered

40:59.860 --> 41:08.660
is in effect so the um current funding determinations are for fiscal year 2023-24

41:08.660 --> 41:13.700
a charter school could submit a reconsideration request anytime during that fiscal year or really

41:13.700 --> 41:16.900
anytime during the period for which their funding determination

41:21.860 --> 41:26.660
and maybe I missed this by reviewing the file but how how many of these are alternative schools

41:27.380 --> 41:32.500
I know we had one public speaker from I do not have that information on hand right now but I

41:32.500 --> 41:39.620
can definitely look that up and get back to you I can ask one more clarifying question follow up on

41:39.620 --> 41:51.780
that um is that if following up on a member Yoshimoto Tari's question if the motion doesn't

41:51.780 --> 42:06.100
pass and the one that I made um and the schools choose to come back um is there so what they

42:06.100 --> 42:13.140
submitted for this funding determination request was based on audited financials

42:14.260 --> 42:18.740
so they would is it true that they would need to wait another year to have another round of

42:18.740 --> 42:26.260
audited financials to submit and if that's true is the funding retroactive suggesting that

42:28.420 --> 42:34.580
or is it in that or is the funding retroactive because if it isn't then of the two-year term

42:34.580 --> 42:41.540
the most they could be hoping for is one year of full funding is that correct

42:42.260 --> 42:48.340
I believe the funding can be retroactive um again during the reconsideration request schools

42:48.340 --> 42:55.540
indicate which periods or the period of times that they want to be reconsidered so um in that

42:55.540 --> 43:02.420
regard if it was for let's say a previous fiscal year I believe their funding would be adjusted

43:02.420 --> 43:09.140
retroactively and the the soonest they could come back would be when they have another year

43:09.140 --> 43:19.220
of audited financials to apply with typically that is the case um there have been circumstances

43:19.220 --> 43:24.020
in the past where charter schools have submitted a funding determination funding determination

43:24.020 --> 43:30.100
request based on unaudited actuals or budget data as well and again we do take that into

43:30.100 --> 43:34.180
consideration in our review and if we need additional information then we ask for that

43:35.140 --> 43:35.540

i'm calling regarding our our l cap plan i'm going to try to be very brief uh at this point

49:16.340 --> 49:22.180
in time we have approximately 30 students we can write a more detailed individual education plan

49:22.180 --> 49:28.340
for each student in less pages and in less time then it takes us to fill out the paperwork for

49:28.340 --> 49:34.580
the standard california state l cap uh the number of plans that i present i could do in a much

49:34.580 --> 49:40.340
shorter better manner where my parents would understand very well where the money is going

49:40.340 --> 49:45.460
why it's going there and how it is affecting kids so i'm just calling to let you guys know that this

49:45.460 --> 49:52.660
is an a very important piece that we do need that help the five page plan if you teamed it with a

49:52.660 --> 49:58.980

at girls inc and i am here on behalf of our advocacy group that is advocating for student

50:20.180 --> 50:25.540
mental health rights on campus and we it came to our attention that california senate bill number

50:25.540 --> 50:30.740
14 was amended to include that a people shall be excused from school in the absence is due to the

50:30.740 --> 50:35.060
benefit of the people's mental or behavioral health and we have realized that schools and districts

50:35.060 --> 50:39.940
are not implementing this many administrators are not aware of this and have marked people unexcused

50:39.940 --> 50:45.540
wrongfully or given inaccurate information we are asking that the sb members on the board further

50:45.540 --> 50:51.140
discuss this issue and update illness verification to include mental health as an excuse as excusable

50:51.140 --> 50:56.660
absence we are also asking that schools ensure that they are enforcing excuse mental health

50:56.660 --> 51:01.780
days and are requiring education on sb14 for students also update the illness verification

51:01.780 --> 51:06.580
regular regulations to include for the benefit of the people's mental health or behavioral health

51:06.580 --> 51:12.580

hello i'm gabriella moffey proud to be in my 10th year as superintendent of the award-winning

51:26.340 --> 51:30.980
garden grove unified school district as you've read in my recent correspondence the state system

51:30.980 --> 51:36.100
for both rewards distinguished schools and accountability differentiated assistance is deeply

51:36.100 --> 51:41.060
flawed in respect to the dashboard element of chronic absenteeism this year both programs were

51:41.060 --> 51:45.060
based on last year's data and eight of our schools should have received distinguished schools

51:45.060 --> 51:50.020
but were denied due to chronic absenteeism based exclusively on COVID-19 absences

51:50.020 --> 51:54.500
absences which were required by the state health order in respect to distinguished schools many of

51:54.500 --> 51:58.180
our parents will share with you their extreme disappointment in the state for denying their

51:58.180 --> 52:02.420
schools this award as they feel like the state is penalizing them for following the rules instead of

52:02.420 --> 52:06.980
rewarding them as their children still excelled academically despite the fact that they were

52:06.980 --> 52:11.700
required to stay home due to circumstances out of their control in respect to differentiated

52:11.700 --> 52:18.500
assistance we had 33 schools identified for atsi none for csi but 21 of those were also solely

52:18.500 --> 52:23.300
based on COVID-19 absences from last year i've submitted detailed written public comments for

52:23.300 --> 52:27.540
this meeting on both of these issues and i have faith that the state will make this right for our

52:27.540 --> 52:33.620
students families and schools thank you thank you next caller please state your name and affiliation

52:33.620 --> 52:38.580

53:33.620 --> 53:52.260
a parent of antony elementary school in the garden girl unify school district

53:52.260 --> 53:56.660
antony parents take great pride in our school this year we are running for the national blue

53:56.660 --> 54:01.860
ribbon and last year we ranked in the top 20 percent of our school by u.s news and will report

54:01.860 --> 54:06.900
we were shocked that our school did not earn the california distinguished school award based on

54:06.900 --> 54:11.860
only on our COVID-19 absences my daughter both had COVID absence the past year that met the

54:11.860 --> 54:16.660
chronic absenteeism criteria however our absence for both girls were due to the

54:16.660 --> 54:20.980
state-mandated COVID requirements despite the absence of spoken stay on top of the

54:20.980 --> 54:26.180
missed schoolwork and the grades reflect that evidence report got showed us she met our standard

54:26.180 --> 54:32.660
and caley exceeded standard both e.l.a and math on the state aspect test our children were required

54:32.660 --> 54:37.700
to stay home and still work very hard to stay on top of their schoolwork doesn't this doesn't the

54:37.700 --> 54:43.700
state trust us that we only kept our children home when it was medical necessary and required by law

54:43.700 --> 54:47.300

Hola, soy Elvia Magaña y soy madre de familia de la escuela primaria Hazard en el distrito

55:18.140 --> 55:19.140
escolar unificado de Colorado.

55:19.140 --> 55:21.700
Hola, soy Elvia Magaña from the primary school.

55:21.700 --> 55:25.180
¿Puede repetir el nombre de la escuela, por favor?

55:25.180 --> 55:28.780
Si quiere, yo puedo leer la traducción en inglés.

55:28.780 --> 55:31.060
Como usted dice, señora.

55:31.060 --> 55:33.500
Okay, I'll read Spanish first and then English.

55:33.500 --> 55:38.420
Hola, soy Elvia Magaña y soy madre de familia de la escuela primaria Hazard en el distrito

55:38.420 --> 55:40.340
escolar unificado de Garden Grove.

55:40.340 --> 55:42.860
Hazard es escuela galardonada.

55:42.860 --> 55:48.780
Fue nombrada escuela distinguida de California en el 2020 y en el 2022 clasificó en el 20%

55:48.780 --> 55:53.300
las mejores de todas las escuelas primarias por U.S. News and World Report y recibió

55:53.300 --> 55:54.780
el premio de oro de PBIS.

55:54.780 --> 55:59.820
Nos sorprendió descubrir que la única razón por la que Hazard no recibió el premio de

55:59.820 --> 56:03.900
escuela distinguida de California este año es por las ausencias de COVID.

56:03.900 --> 56:09.420
A mi esposo le dio COVID en agosto de 2021 y mis hijas y yo tuvimos que permanecer en

56:09.420 --> 56:11.420
cuarentena por 10 días.

56:11.420 --> 56:17.220
Después en octubre de 2021, Emily tuvo síntomas parecidos al resfriado y se le requirió tomar

56:17.220 --> 56:19.500
otra cuarentena de 10 días.

56:19.500 --> 56:23.780
En enero de 2022, a mis hijas y a mí nos dio COVID.

56:23.780 --> 56:28.700
Una vez más, seguimos los protocolos y trabajamos arduamente para mantener a nuestras hijas

56:28.700 --> 56:32.420
al día con el trabajo escolar a pesar de los días perdidos.

56:32.420 --> 56:36.540
Me sorprendió que el estado sancionara a las escuelas al negarles este reconocimiento

56:36.540 --> 56:39.300
cuando el estado fue quien creó los requisitos de COVID.

56:41.780 --> 56:45.620
Hello, my name is Elvia Magaña and I'm a parent at Hazard Elementary School in the

56:45.620 --> 56:47.620
Garden Grove Unified School District.

56:47.620 --> 56:49.620
Hazard is an award-winning school.

56:49.620 --> 56:54.540
We earned the California Distinguished School Award in 2020 and in 2022, we ranked in the

56:54.540 --> 56:59.500
top 20% of all elementary schools by U.S. News and World Report and received the PBIS

56:59.500 --> 57:02.220
Gold Award for a positive culture and climate.

57:02.220 --> 57:05.420
We were shocked to find out that the only reason we didn't receive the California

57:05.420 --> 57:09.420
Distinguished School Award this year is because of our COVID absences.

57:09.420 --> 57:13.860
When my husband tested positive for COVID in August 2021, my daughters and I had to

57:13.860 --> 57:15.540
quarantine for 10 days.

57:15.540 --> 57:20.820
Then, in October 2021, Emily had cold-like symptoms and was required to take another

57:20.820 --> 57:22.340
10-day quarantine.

57:22.340 --> 57:26.820
In January 2022, my daughters and I all tested positive for COVID.

57:26.820 --> 57:29.020
Once again, we followed the protocols.

57:29.020 --> 57:33.340
Our family worked hard to keep up with our daughters' schoolwork despite the mis-states.

57:33.340 --> 57:37.260
It's surprising to us that the state would punish schools by denying them this honor

57:37.260 --> 57:40.700
when the state was the one who created the COVID requirements in the first place.

57:40.700 --> 57:41.420
Thank you.

57:43.340 --> 57:44.220
Thank you.

57:45.580 --> 57:47.100

Hola, mi nombre es Jacqueline Andrade.

57:53.620 --> 57:57.300
Yo hablo español y inglés, so voy a empezar en español.

57:57.340 --> 58:02.060
Una vez más, mi nombre es Jacqueline Andrade y mis dos hijas asisten a la escuela primaria

58:02.060 --> 58:06.940
Morningside en el Distrito Escolar Unificado de Garland Grove, una escuela excepcional.

58:06.940 --> 58:12.460
Estamos orgullosos de que superamos consistentemente a otras escuelas en las pruebas estatales.

58:12.460 --> 58:19.020
Esperábamos ser la escuela distinguida de California de 2023 como en el 2019, y nos

58:19.020 --> 58:24.500
sorprendió mucho que el estado no nos concedió el premio debido a nuestras ausencias de COVID.

58:24.500 --> 58:29.340
Mis hijas se vieron muy afectadas por las reglas impuestas por el estado durante la pandemia.

58:29.340 --> 58:34.860
Mis hijas también se vieron obligadas a quedarse en casa por estar expuestas a una persona con COVID.

58:34.860 --> 58:40.140
Mis hijas tuvieron ascencias justificados por haber estado en contacto con familiares con COVID.

58:40.140 --> 58:44.020
Además, perdieron trabajo escolar, instrucciones y a sus amigos.

58:44.020 --> 58:49.140
Aún así, ambas continuaron teniendo un desempeño excepcional en sus trabajos escolares,

58:49.140 --> 58:52.940
cumpliendo y superando todas las normas del nivel de grado.

58:52.940 --> 58:54.300
Once again, my name is Jacqueline.

58:54.300 --> 58:59.540
I have two daughters at 10 Morningside Elementary in the Garland Grove Unified School District,

58:59.540 --> 59:00.660
an outstanding school.

59:00.660 --> 59:05.420
We are proud that Morningside consistently outperforms other schools on state testing.

59:05.420 --> 59:12.100
We expected to be a 2023 California distinguished schools like in 2019, and we're surprised

59:12.100 --> 59:16.060
that the state didn't grant us the award because of our COVID absences.

59:16.060 --> 59:21.140
My children were greatly affected by the rules that the state put in place during the pandemic.

59:21.140 --> 59:26.060
My children were forced to stay home because of exposure to COVID positive person.

59:26.060 --> 59:30.300
My daughters had excused absences, all due to being in close contact with relatives who

59:30.300 --> 59:31.300
had COVID.

59:31.300 --> 59:35.340
Furthermore, they missed schoolwork, instruction and their friends.

59:35.340 --> 59:40.020
Still, they both continue to have outstanding performance in their schoolwork, meeting and

59:40.020 --> 59:45.700
excelling at all grade level standards.

59:45.700 --> 59:48.020
Thank you.

59:48.020 --> 59:50.540
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

59:50.540 --> 59:51.540
You have one minute.

59:51.540 --> 59:52.540
Your time starts now.

59:52.540 --> 59:59.980
Hello, my name is Jen, and I'm a parent at Patent Elementary School in the Garland Grove

59:59.980 --> 01:00:01.380
Unified School District.

01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:06.720
I wanted to voice my opinion, opposition to Patent being unfairly denied the 2023 California

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:11.340
distinguished school award due solely to our COVID-19 absences.

01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:15.300
The state is giving out awards for school with high academic performance, and we have

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:16.300
that.

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:17.780
We hit all of the marks.

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:20.700
Our ELA and math score ranked very high.

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:25.060
Our English learner progress indicator is high, and our suspension rates are low.

01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:30.060
Despite the challenges of COVID-19, we worked hard, but we were denied the award due to

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:34.620
COVID-19 absences, which were required by the state quarantine rules.

01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:40.740
My daughter had 20 excused absences during the 2021-22 school year due to COVID-related

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:43.740
symptoms and being in close contact.

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:48.500
Despite the missed day, we worked hard to coordinate missed work from the school and

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:52.420
ensure that she did not fall behind in her schoolwork.

01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:57.500
We were so proud when she met and exceeded standards on the state SBAC test.

01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:00.660
In the end, we know our students are high achieving, and we don't need the state to

01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:05.500
tell us so, but we certainly don't appreciate being excluded for something out of our control

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.300
that you mandated.

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:08.300
Thank you.

01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:10.100
Thank you.

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:11.460

Caller, you are now live.

01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:31.380
Hi.

01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:32.380
Please start your public comment.

01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:33.380
Go ahead.

01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:37.860
Hi, my name is Lisa Ichikawa, and I have two sons at Excelsior Elementary School in Garden

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:39.900
Grove Unified School District.

01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:43.500
When I learned that our school did not receive the California Distinguished Schools Award

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:46.700
because of COVID absences, I was appalled.

01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:51.420
Excelsior earned the California Distinguished Schools Award in 2020, and our test scores

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:54.860
show that we should have earned it this year too.

01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:59.100
We didn't want our sons to miss so many days of school, but we had to follow the state

01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:00.100
guidelines.

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:05.860
Grant was sent home so many times for COVID-19 symptoms that he was classified as chronically

01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:06.860
absent.

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:10.020
It turns out he had severe dust allergies.

01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:14.940
When Grant also tested positive for COVID-19, both of our sons had to stay home for the

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:19.500
required five days and could not return until we had a negative test.

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:23.580
Both boys had to stay home for additional days due to being close contacts.

01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:28.060
Their teachers did an amazing job to help them stay on track, and they continue to meet

01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:29.060
and exceed standards.

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:34.460
The state should give the California Distinguished Schools to all disturbing schools, but leave

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:36.460
COVID-19 absences out of it.

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:40.620
This does not discourage all that we have accomplished academically, and the state should

01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:41.620
know that.

01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:44.620
Thank you.

01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:46.140
Next caller, you're now live.

01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:47.140
Please start your public comment.

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:53.300
Hi, I'm Javad Arain, a parent at Murdy Elementary School in the Gardner Grove Unified School

01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:57.820
District, and I'm urging the state to reconsider Murdy Elementary for the California Distinguished

01:02:57.820 --> 01:03:02.980
School Award, since the school met all criteria for this except its chronic absenteeism data,

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:05.540
which was due to COVID-19 absences.

01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:10.740
In the 2021-22 school year, my daughter contracted COVID-19, which necessitated her prolonged

01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:13.900
absence from school due to state required quarantine protocols.

01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:18.380
Despite these circumstances, the school ensured that Sonia was provided with appropriate remote

01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:21.380
learning opportunities to minimize the impact on her education.

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:26.540
My daughter's absences were directly related to a medical situation beyond our control.

01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:30.580
The school should not be penalized for circumstances such as these, which are unforeseeable and

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:31.580
unavoidable.

01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:35.300
Murdy Elementary School's rigorous academic programs, innovative teaching methods, and

01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:40.260
inclusive culture have significantly contributed to the development and success of its students.

01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:44.500
It should not be denied this award for following the state-mandated COVID protocols.

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:45.500
Thank you.

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:47.500
Thank you.

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:48.500
Next caller, you're now live.

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:50.860
Please start your public comment.

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:56.900
Hello, my name is Allison Tong, and my daughter attends Barker Elementary School in the Gardner

01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:58.720
Grove Unified School District.

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:03.320
We recently learned that we were denied the California Distinguished Schools Award due

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:05.280
to our COVID absences.

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:10.160
This was not only extremely disappointing to our parents, but also to our staff who work

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:12.300
hard to help students succeed.

01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:15.000
My daughter was a TK student last year.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.760
She has an IEP, and we all work really hard to ensure that she is continuing to achieve

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:21.760
her new developmental milestones.

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:27.720
In fact, she is meeting grade level standards and doing well this year as a first grader,

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:32.040
especially since last year she suffered long COVID diagnosed by her doctor.

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:38.720
Emma missed a lot of school last year, but that is because she had long COVID as well

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.720
as other exposures.

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:45.360
The state shouldn't punish schools for following state and county health requirements and for

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:47.560
doing our part to slow the spread.

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:48.560
Thank you.

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:51.560
Thank you.

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:53.160
Next caller, you're now live.

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.240
Please start your public comment.

01:04:55.240 --> 01:05:01.120
Hello, my name is Dat Sweeney, and two of my children, Timothy and Elizabeth, attend

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:05.200
Garden Park Elementary School in the Garden Grove Unified School District.

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:08.840
We were really disappointed to learn that we were denied the California Distinguished

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:11.480
Schools Award due to COVID absences.

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:15.820
It seemed wrong to punish schools where families followed the rules during COVID.

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:20.840
When COVID hit, it was hard on the entire family, and when my wife and I tested positive,

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:24.440
our children were required to stay home for 13 days of school.

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:28.680
It was impossible to isolate as we had to properly care for our children.

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:31.400
Then when our children had COVID, they missed more days.

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:36.560
So despite missing so much school, both Timothy and Elizabeth continued to maintain high academic

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:37.560
performance.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:40.760
They both exceeded standards on all state tests and district benchmarks.

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:46.040
As their father, I'm so proud of their endurance, perseverance, and determination to earn high

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:48.880
academic marks during a very challenging time.

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:54.120
The state should remove COVID absences from its formula for measuring academic success.

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:55.120
Thank you.

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:56.120
Thank you.

01:05:56.120 --> 01:06:01.960
That concludes public comment for item number 14.

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:07.760
Thank you very much, and, you know, of course, these are items that are not agendized that

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:13.240
we hear about, but I do want to note that we are going to hear about the chronic absenteeism

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:17.800
indicator in our July meeting, so we will be following up on some of the commentary

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.220
that we've just heard.

01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:21.500
And with that, thank you.

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:30.380
I hereby adjourn our May 2023 meeting at 1042 a.m., and I look forward to seeing you in July.
