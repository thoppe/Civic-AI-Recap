WEBVTT

00:05.051 --> 00:07.092
The State Board will come to order.

00:07.532 --> 00:20.657
We will start with the Pledge of Allegiance and then please remain standing because we will have a choral group come in next to sing the National Anthem and present some other songs to us.

00:20.677 --> 00:26.639
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States

00:29.394 --> 00:36.490
for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

01:14.988 --> 01:32.157
Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?

01:33.041 --> 01:51.008
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?

01:52.908 --> 02:00.271
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,

02:01.320 --> 02:09.688
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.

02:12.511 --> 02:20.398
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave

02:23.192 --> 02:33.922
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

02:58.697 --> 02:59.059
All right.

02:59.079 --> 03:01.291
Thank you.

03:02.068 --> 03:06.971
Good morning, President Kirst, Superintendent Thurmond, and state board colleagues.

03:07.232 --> 03:08.693
I'm talking to you behind me.

03:09.773 --> 03:13.676
We're in a time of transition of this body and of the work that we do.

03:14.116 --> 03:15.878
And transitions are always bittersweet.

03:16.478 --> 03:30.408
In honor of President Kirst and my colleagues for which this meeting will be the last, and to welcome Superintendent Thurmond for which this meeting will be his first, I wanted to start us off with a reminder of why we do what we do.

03:31.168 --> 03:45.222
It's my pleasure to introduce the Natomas Charter Schools Performing and Fine Arts Academy Vocal Ensemble under the direction of Julian Cunningham, Vocal Teacher and Vocal Director, and Owen Meyer, Teaching Associate and Accompanist.

03:45.723 --> 03:54.311
And joined by them is Kathy Romero-Mollet, our Arts and Outreach Coordinator, and Sierra Hersick, Director of the Natomas Arts and Education Foundation.

03:55.172 --> 04:05.579
Dr. Kirst, with all due respect, I just felt that after so many meetings of your pledge, we needed to add a little bit of oomph to the flag salute.

04:07.020 --> 04:09.982
And so with our rendition of the national anthem.

04:10.342 --> 04:12.924
So now our students have two more songs for you.

04:13.805 --> 04:16.546
This next one is called Until I Met You.

04:16.947 --> 04:20.269
It's a love song to welcome Superintendent Thurman.

04:22.410 --> 04:30.415
And then we will end with a final song called My Wish, and this is to all of my outgoing board members.

04:38.801 --> 04:46.646
I used to be so fancy free, but really long so last can be, till one lucky day you came my way.

04:47.967 --> 04:51.489
I never knew what love was all about until I met you.

04:53.081 --> 04:55.302
I knew it right from the start.

04:55.723 --> 05:00.626
I used to think there'd never be a girl who'd ever care for me.

05:00.666 --> 05:01.866
And what do you know?

05:01.966 --> 05:03.647
You made it so.

05:03.968 --> 05:07.750
I never knew what love was all about until I met you.

05:07.850 --> 05:11.772
Once we start, then we'll never part.

05:12.133 --> 05:18.597
In my new life, no one at all would even care if I cried.

05:18.637 --> 05:21.839
Deep inside in my new life,

05:23.372 --> 05:28.294
I'm walking tall, I got a feeling of pride, going inside.

05:28.494 --> 05:31.595
Remember, you're the reason why I'm holding her on track.

05:31.635 --> 05:32.415
Now, who do you see?

05:32.715 --> 05:33.515
The monkey is me!

05:33.795 --> 05:39.497
I never knew what love was all about, but I feel that I know.

05:39.717 --> 05:47.420
It's a cherry cake, where you can get an apple plus a pie.

06:29.670 --> 06:31.751
I'm sure you know that that is so

07:53.197 --> 07:54.318
nobody has too much

08:28.794 --> 08:50.286
It's got me stumbling, it's got me mumbling I'm like a ship without a rudder, a car without wheels Unless you feel it, I can't reveal it You gotta have it happen to you

08:50.968 --> 09:18.301
I know how it feels One thing's sure, love has got me I'm as certain, as certain can be I'm yours till eternity From the day that we met When you showed up instead

09:21.738 --> 09:33.105
I took one look at you And what else could I do?

10:00.573 --> 10:06.592
Now it's only done one, and we'll make it two.

10:41.841 --> 10:47.943
I hope one day you tell me we didn't come fast enough.

10:48.043 --> 10:53.145
You got your way, you got your way, you got your way.

10:53.265 --> 11:06.249
And if your faith's been chosen, you have a choice, you have a choice.

11:17.965 --> 11:19.406
I wish

11:33.740 --> 11:39.123
is that this life becomes all that you want to do.

11:39.163 --> 11:42.445
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small.

11:42.705 --> 11:45.747
You'll never need to carry more than you can hold.

11:45.867 --> 11:55.371
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to, I hope you know somebody loves you and wants the same things too.

11:56.072 --> 12:00.814
Yeah, this is my world.

12:05.282 --> 12:33.600
♪ And you'll never forget it ♪ ♪ All the funs we've loved you in the place you left you ♪ ♪ All the promises we gave you and you'll never regret it ♪ ♪ And you'll help somebody every chance you get ♪ ♪ Oh, with life comes grace and every mistake ♪ ♪ And I'll give you more than you take ♪ ♪ And I'll give you more than you take ♪ ♪ I'll give you more than you take ♪ ♪ I'll give you more than you take ♪ ♪ I'll give you more than you take ♪ ♪ I'll give you more than you take ♪ ♪ I'll give you more than you take ♪ ♪ I'll give you more than you take ♪ ♪ I

12:34.600 --> 12:38.501
that this life becomes all that you wanted to.

12:38.541 --> 12:41.722
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.562
Remember, we do care more than you can hold.

12:45.002 --> 12:53.904
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to, I hope you know somebody loves you and wants the same things, too.

12:53.944 --> 12:55.705
Yeah, Liv.

13:04.897 --> 13:10.303
My wish is for you.

13:11.584 --> 13:22.634
My wish for you is that this life becomes all that you want it to.

13:22.714 --> 13:25.737
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small.

13:25.757 --> 13:28.660
You never need to carry more than you can hold.

13:29.158 --> 13:42.687
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to I hope you know somebody loves you And wants the same things too Yeah, this is my wish for you My wish for you

13:55.746 --> 14:00.390
Madness for you Madness for you Madness for you

14:58.466 --> 15:02.587
Yeah, what an exhilarating start.

15:02.607 --> 15:06.028
Yeah, our best meeting, opening meeting ever.

15:06.448 --> 15:16.851
And really appreciative of that by board member Ting Sun, who's the head of the Natomas Charter School in nearby Natomas outside Sacramento.

15:19.130 --> 15:24.496
With that as a good way to kick off, we now welcome the superintendent formally.

15:25.837 --> 15:33.726
And I'm sure the board members that will continue look forward to a good and strong working relationship with him.

15:34.888 --> 15:38.632
And so we're now ready for your state superintendent's report.

15:42.830 --> 15:43.991
Thank you, President Kirsten.

15:44.151 --> 15:45.952
Thank you, Vice President and members of the board.

15:45.972 --> 15:51.336
I think that the board is supposed to sing back to our student performers.

15:52.477 --> 15:53.878
That was a beautiful rendition.

15:54.418 --> 16:00.783
The harmonizing on the a cappella version of the anthem was fantastic.

16:01.743 --> 16:05.904
Thank you for the serenade song that you gave for me and my welcome.

16:06.664 --> 16:24.809
And I thought it was quite fitting, the song that the students ended with, My Wish, because that is really what this should all be about, our wish for our students to live a great life and for them to have the opportunity to have big dreams and for their worries to be small.

16:24.969 --> 16:26.329
And I can't think of a better way

16:26.969 --> 16:30.192
to make that wish come true through education.

16:31.073 --> 16:37.199
It has been the way that my dreams have come true through education.

16:37.339 --> 16:40.122
I'm on day three on the job and I haven't broken anything yet.

16:40.963 --> 16:44.987
And I say yet because I'm sure the time will come.

16:45.967 --> 17:00.496
But it's my hope that what will guide me and us in our work going forward is the wish that every one of our six million students will have a quality education and the chance to live a great life.

17:00.696 --> 17:13.284
It has been the manifestation of my journey, you know, as a student who is the descendant of African slaves and immigrants from Panama and Colombia and Jamaica.

17:14.064 --> 17:18.989
who was a free lunch student and a student who ate more government cheese than you can imagine.

17:19.169 --> 17:22.712
You know, we ate so much of it, I thought that USDA was a brand name.

17:24.293 --> 17:27.456
My family struggled, but we persevered.

17:28.036 --> 17:33.180
And the greatest public program I ever had a chance to participate in was getting a great public education.

17:33.781 --> 17:34.641
And it saved my life.

17:35.362 --> 17:42.288
And it informs every act and decision that I have taken in my career and in my life as a parent,

17:43.889 --> 17:54.739
as an advocate and I'm hopeful for the chance to work closely with this board as partners that work that we can do together.

17:55.500 --> 18:05.929
And I want to thank you for the work that you all have done over the course of these last couple of years to bring us policies that have helped to move the needle in the right direction.

18:06.790 --> 18:07.110
Certainly,

18:09.192 --> 18:27.510
None as significant as the local control funding formula and the frameworks that have come with that and ways to engage parents and students and families in the conversation about where we prioritize our dollars and how we support our students and how we support students who need additional support.

18:28.631 --> 18:43.210
The work that you've done around the dashboard and how we talk about accountability and version 2.0 to say that we want it to be as accessible as possible to students and to families and to our community partners.

18:43.710 --> 19:03.575
I thank you for your accessibility in listening to the people of California who have said we care about accountability, we care about transparency, but we want it to be user-friendly and for being willing to work on ways to make that more accessible to them.

19:04.335 --> 19:10.957
So many things that I can point to that you all have worked on, and I know that there's so many more that we will work on together.

19:11.777 --> 19:26.210
I am your servant, not just by the mandate of the bylaws that govern our work here, but that is the mandate in my heart that I have many people that I work for.

19:27.171 --> 19:34.258
First and foremost, the six million students in our state and their families and all of you and all of our partners.

19:35.319 --> 19:37.100
I was humbled by

19:39.827 --> 19:43.328
the swearing-in ceremony that we had this week, and I know that many of you attended.

19:43.788 --> 19:48.690
And I want to thank you for that, for being a part of the start.

19:48.770 --> 19:49.430
What did they say?

19:49.970 --> 19:52.351
That this was my first meeting, but not my last.

19:52.991 --> 19:56.893
And the song said that this would be the start to which we'll never part.

19:57.693 --> 19:59.854
And I want to thank you for being a part of my journey.

20:00.554 --> 20:06.356
I look to you for advice and guidance on the work that we do together and the work that I might do individually.

20:07.256 --> 20:14.619
Whether we agree or disagree on some issues, I think we agree on one thing, and that is that every one of our students deserves to have a great education.

20:14.939 --> 20:24.343
And in that respect, I look forward to a great partnership, and the entire staff and team at the California Department of Education is here to support you.

20:25.263 --> 20:38.109
to the board members for whom this is your final meeting, a great word of thanks and gratitude for your service, for your sacrifice.

20:39.610 --> 20:50.095
I don't know all of what you've done, but I've served on a board of sorts before, and I know that it often comes with sacrifice, time away from family, time away from your job.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.417
This is not something that you do for compensation.

20:54.637 --> 20:57.138
You probably lose compensation to do this.

20:57.838 --> 20:59.018
It is truly a labor of love.

20:59.058 --> 21:05.699
And I always tell people that I think that being on a board of education is the hardest job in politics.

21:06.260 --> 21:08.340
No one shows up unless someone's angry.

21:09.140 --> 21:12.321
And often when great things are happening, you can hear crickets in the chamber.

21:13.201 --> 21:20.122
But it is one of the most rewarding positions I've ever had the opportunity to serve in, whether it's just visiting schools and reading the students.

21:20.663 --> 21:22.723
And you are crafting policy that has guided

21:23.423 --> 21:24.885
where education needs to go.

21:25.586 --> 21:33.975
I would say this, thank you for your service and thank you for what I know that you all will be prepared to help us do going forward.

21:34.776 --> 21:37.939
I think this is a pivotal moment for the state of California.

21:38.740 --> 21:39.741
We've had challenges

21:40.542 --> 21:44.204
And we've laid a plan and a foundation for how to overcome those challenges.

21:45.065 --> 21:47.226
And you all have set that tone for us.

21:47.927 --> 21:59.974
I think now is our go forward moment and to show the outcomes, the output for the input that you have provided.

22:00.715 --> 22:06.358
I think this is the moment where we stand up and we say that California is a special place.

22:07.279 --> 22:13.009
and that California students are stars, just like the students that greeted us this morning.

22:13.429 --> 22:14.050
They are stars.

22:14.091 --> 22:17.817
We had students who played trumpet in their hands.

22:19.614 --> 22:26.659
I cannot think of a better example of resilience, of doing what you have to do with whatever it is that you have.

22:27.339 --> 22:33.643
You would have thought that those students were performing with a stand-up bass and a drummer and a full band.

22:34.324 --> 22:37.986
They stood up here and sang from their heart and their smiles.

22:38.786 --> 22:42.909
And as they sang, I thought about the possibility for every single student.

22:43.229 --> 22:45.371
And so I think that they've given us a great charge.

22:46.051 --> 22:50.333
for what we should be doing to move California in the next direction.

22:50.393 --> 22:51.894
I think this is our time.

22:52.574 --> 22:57.457
I thank you, board members, for the foundation and the roadmap that you have set.

22:58.137 --> 23:02.399
Now let us move forward and move California forward on behalf of our six million students.

23:02.439 --> 23:05.921
Thank you for having me and I look forward to our many meetings together.

23:13.547 --> 23:16.769
Well, now I have to turn to our procedural descriptions.

23:17.169 --> 23:19.390
I don't have anything thrilling to say.

23:20.511 --> 23:30.396
Tomorrow we will open item 23, the SBAE priorities, to acknowledge that this is my last meeting, as well as three of my former colleagues in the board.

23:31.177 --> 23:38.961
And so we will reopen item 23 and 24 tomorrow to take action on our November minutes.

23:39.945 --> 23:43.647
We will have Spanish interpreter services available for item 10.

23:44.187 --> 23:48.249
We have four public hearings, item 4, 5, 6, and 10.

23:49.830 --> 23:54.992
We have the consent calendar and waiver consent items as usual.

23:55.752 --> 24:02.095
There's a handout in the table for the lobby listing those and they are items

24:03.718 --> 24:06.341
11 through 19 and then waiver items 1 through 13.

24:08.263 --> 24:12.087
We have regular consent items, items 11 through 19.

24:12.148 --> 24:24.141
We then have on our area that each and procedures that each board member who wishes to remove an item from either of these consent calendars

24:24.967 --> 24:27.851
should advise our executive director by noon today.

24:27.871 --> 24:42.269
I want to announce that the letters from the public, which are on the electronic folder, the board reads these electronically, and we have them all on that single folder.

24:43.372 --> 24:45.994
We have an electronic agenda as well.

24:46.855 --> 24:58.584
Any speakers who wish to come before the board, please sign up at the table and then signed up on what specific item number you wish to speak on.

24:59.932 --> 25:05.635
And when you come to us, please identify yourself in any way you want.

25:07.196 --> 25:14.059
And we will accept 25 copies of anything you want to hand directly to the board.

25:15.399 --> 25:25.544
And finally, we have TV monitors in an adjoining room and that the board members are all prepared that need to to recuse themselves.

25:26.593 --> 25:34.281
So without further ado, let me announce item one, which is our continuation of our standards adoptions.

25:35.041 --> 25:46.152
And now Stephanie Gregson will present and she'll present in a combined way both the California arts standards and the world language standards.

25:46.232 --> 25:50.256
But we need to approve those two items separately.

25:52.705 --> 25:56.207
Well, good morning, President Kerse, members of the board, Superintendent Gehrman.

25:56.647 --> 25:57.828
My name is Stephanie Gregson.

25:58.068 --> 26:01.030
I serve as the executive director of the Instructional Quality Commission.

26:01.470 --> 26:02.110
I'm honored.

26:03.131 --> 26:04.752
Is that better?

26:06.314 --> 26:07.054
Is it working now?

26:07.775 --> 26:08.075
We're good?

26:08.275 --> 26:08.575
OK.

26:09.076 --> 26:09.476
All right.

26:09.876 --> 26:13.718
Well, you can tell I'm not as smooth as that performance was that we had this morning.

26:14.279 --> 26:14.699
All right.

26:15.439 --> 26:27.186
I am honored and privileged to be in front of you today talking about two vital content areas that can truly be pathway changing for each and every student in California, the arts and world languages standards.

26:27.526 --> 26:35.611
As we saw this morning, we see the power, the courage, the creativity that our students bring to this when they are exposed to language

26:35.951 --> 26:36.491
and the arts.

26:37.492 --> 26:52.077
So before I begin, I would like to give a huge thank you to my Curriculum, Frameworks, and Instructional Resources Division staff for all of their due diligence and hard work in coordinating the development of not one, but two sets of standards at the same time.

26:52.557 --> 26:54.057
I'm truly honored to work with you.

26:54.518 --> 26:55.198
Seaford rocks.

26:58.328 --> 27:00.449
I'd like to introduce Commissioner Nicole Naditz.

27:00.630 --> 27:05.453
She's chair of the World Languages Subject Matter Committee of the Instructional Quality Commission.

27:05.854 --> 27:08.756
She will be presenting the World Languages Standards with me today.

27:11.161 --> 27:16.384
I'd like to start by explaining our standards revision process and our journey to get to this moment.

27:17.084 --> 27:21.987
Both the Arts and World Languages Standards began with legislation signed by former Governor Brown.

27:22.667 --> 27:29.090
Assembly Bill 2862, which initiated the revision of the Visual and Performing Arts Standards, was signed in September 2016.

27:29.230 --> 27:36.114
And Assembly Bill 37, asking for the inclusion of the media arts in the revision, was signed July 2017.

27:38.055 --> 27:45.646
Assembly Bill 2290 initiated the revision of the World Language Arts World Languages Standards and was signed in September 2016.

27:47.229 --> 27:50.794
From there, these two sets of standards had the same exact timeline.

27:51.134 --> 27:51.635
We were busy.

27:52.523 --> 27:59.585
We began in January 2017 with conducting focus groups across the state listening to the teachers in these areas.

28:00.246 --> 28:09.529
Their input and the public comment received were the basis for the guidelines recommended by the Instructional Quality Commission and approved by the State Board in January of 2018.

28:10.909 --> 28:18.311
The State Board also approved the Standards Advisory Committee members for both content areas who met four times between February and June 2018.

28:20.052 --> 28:26.976
The two committees were very productive and sent draft standards to the Instructional Quality Commission for recommendation in July of 2018.

28:28.437 --> 28:33.240
All standards advisory committee meetings were public and provided opportunities for public comment.

28:33.780 --> 28:39.363
The Instructional Quality Commission initiated the 60-day public review period from August to September 2018.

28:41.064 --> 28:53.318
The Instructional Quality Commission discussed and recommended changes at their November 2018 meeting, which brings us to today, where Commissioner Naditz and I will present to you the Draft California Arts and World Languages Standards.

28:55.066 --> 28:57.247
We will begin with the California Art Standards.

28:58.087 --> 29:03.749
Thomas Merton said, art enables us to find ourselves and lose ourselves at the same time.

29:04.750 --> 29:07.511
Pablo Picasso said, every child is an artist.

29:08.011 --> 29:11.132
The problem is how to remain an artist once we grow up.

29:12.413 --> 29:22.817
Our goal with the revision of the art standards is to help our students find themselves, find their pathway, and continue to be artists throughout their lives, as arts is a guide to inclusion.

29:24.591 --> 29:28.337
This lovely picture shows the Standards Advisory Committee for the Arts Standards.

29:28.758 --> 29:35.668
They are a dedicated and hardworking group of educators that revise the standards with a lens of access for each and every student.

29:36.169 --> 29:39.575
The advisory committee was comprised of a majority of classroom teachers.

29:41.345 --> 29:45.430
The Standards Advisory Committee grounded their revision in the state board adopted guidelines.

29:46.051 --> 29:59.868
The guidelines required the revised standards to be based on the National Core Arts Standards, otherwise known as NCAS, including the way they're organized around the five disciplines of dance, media arts, music, theater, and visual arts.

30:00.589 --> 30:16.854
to have an emphasis on artistic processes and aesthetic experiences such as creating, performing, producing, presenting, responding, and connecting, which are utilized in the NCAST, into each of the artistic disciplines and ensure that they're creating, performing, responding, and

30:19.671 --> 30:22.192
connecting are utilized throughout, embedded throughout.

30:23.012 --> 30:30.393
To follow the principles of universal design for learning and have them woven throughout for inclusion of each and every student.

30:31.273 --> 30:37.074
To support the student's art experience, appreciation and understanding to create lifelong artists.

30:37.874 --> 30:46.816
To have students demonstrate the knowledge and skills of the standards within each discipline and to be written in language that is inclusive and supportive of multiple users.

30:49.059 --> 30:56.324
The California Art Standards are organized around the five artistic disciplines of dance, media arts, music, theater, and visual arts.

30:57.004 --> 31:14.736
For each of the five disciplines, there are four artistic processes, 11 anchor standards with aligned enduring understandings and essential questions, and individual pre-kindergarten through grade 12 performance standards that are articulated as measurable and attainable learning goals, learning targets.

31:15.456 --> 31:22.523
There are four artistic processes, which are the cognitive and physical actions by which arts learning and making are realized.

31:23.164 --> 31:27.448
The four processes are meant to be used in combination depending on the needs of the lesson.

31:28.028 --> 31:32.853
A single lesson will probably not address all four processes, but a unit of study might.

31:33.954 --> 31:38.097
The processes are not meant to work in any specified order.

31:38.297 --> 31:44.642
The artistic process connecting is useful for integration among arts disciplines and with other content areas.

31:45.463 --> 31:57.792
Essential questions and enduring understandings work together to support an inquiry-based approach to arts education, an approach emphasized in college and career-ready standards across all the content areas.

31:58.733 --> 32:07.139
Enduring understandings are statements summarizing important ideas and core processes that are central to disciplines and have lasting value beyond the classroom.

32:07.579 --> 32:11.081
They also enable students to make connections to other disciplines beyond the arts.

32:12.022 --> 32:15.504
Essential questions guide students inquiry into these enduring understandings.

32:15.985 --> 32:19.147
The enduring understandings and essential questions vary by discipline.

32:20.027 --> 32:28.353
The anchor and performance standards are based on the artistic processes of creating, performing, producing, presenting, responding, and connecting.

32:30.134 --> 32:33.356
I'd like to highlight just a few of the exciting elements of the revised standards.

32:33.996 --> 32:35.917
The standards are inclusive of all disciplines.

32:35.977 --> 32:44.963
This is the basis for why the Instructional Quality Commission is recommending the name for these standards become the California Arts Standards, to be inclusive of all the arts disciplines.

32:45.763 --> 33:03.557
This includes the new media art standards that are designed to enable students to achieve media art literacy and help prepare students to access California's creative economy, such as photography, imaging, sound, animation, graphic design, virtual design, combinations of emerging forms such as multimedia and virtual design.

33:04.378 --> 33:16.547
The standards have an inquiry approach, as we find in our other state standards, along with connections to other content areas to show how instruction can be integrated into other areas such as math, science, and English language arts.

33:17.528 --> 33:22.952
There is a heavier emphasis on creativity within the artistic processes that the standards are organized around.

33:23.553 --> 33:26.375
As Henry Matisse said, creativity takes courage.

33:26.936 --> 33:30.718
And we want all of our students to have the space to be courageous in their creativity.

33:31.579 --> 33:33.780
The standards were developed with a lens of equity.

33:33.980 --> 33:38.323
They are inclusive to help ensure access to the arts for each and every student.

33:39.083 --> 33:43.546
Here's one specific example of a standard that excludes the equity lens.

33:44.267 --> 33:58.115
The Standards Advisory Committee utilized the Students with Disabilities and Core Arts Standards Guiding Principles for Teachers document that was developed from the Kennedy Center and went through each standard to ensure all standards could be accessed by all students.

33:58.675 --> 34:04.756
This example is from fifth grade, the discipline dance, the creative process of performing, and it's anchor standard four.

34:05.537 --> 34:10.818
You can see the original standard included language through focus of eyes and other body parts.

34:11.538 --> 34:16.559
This may unintentionally exclude some of our students from being able to access the standard.

34:17.319 --> 34:23.241
It has been revised to read with intentionality and focus, more inclusive for each and every student.

34:23.641 --> 34:28.082
This means that any student is able to participate in activities aligned with the standard.

34:30.390 --> 34:37.934
The next steps in our work is developing the teacher and administrator guidance to help teachers in their implementation of the California Arts Standards.

34:38.474 --> 34:45.858
The Arts Framework will be based on the standards and guidelines developed from the focus groups of art teachers conducted across the state in 2018.

34:46.578 --> 34:51.360
We are also working with our partners on a professional learning plan for the Arts Standards and Arts Framework.

34:52.061 --> 34:56.723
Before we move on to the World Languages Standards, I'll pause for any questions regarding the Arts Standards.

34:57.503 --> 34:58.304
Board member questions.

35:00.549 --> 35:03.575
Okay, go ahead on languages.

35:04.817 --> 35:13.112
So, Flora Lewis said, learning another language is not only learning different words for the same things, but learning another way to think about things.

35:14.031 --> 35:26.218
We know that student success in an interconnected world, their college and career readiness, and global citizenship depend on learners' opportunities to engage in learning multiple languages and develop multiple perspectives.

35:26.738 --> 35:36.084
This is why you will see our revised world languages standards are focused on ensuring successful entry at any point in a language class from kindergarten through grade 12.

35:38.447 --> 35:42.170
This work began with this knowledgeable and dedicated standards advisory committee.

35:42.651 --> 35:46.814
The committee was comprised of a majority of world languages teachers across all grade levels.

35:47.315 --> 35:53.040
They spent four meetings together developing the revised draft standards that Commissioner Nieditz will now present to you.

35:58.645 --> 35:59.065
Good morning.

35:59.085 --> 36:05.667
It is my honor to be able to share with you this overview of the world languages standards starting with the guidelines.

36:06.427 --> 36:20.310
These guidelines represent the expertise of the field of world language education in California and were developed based on the input and contributions of participants across the states in multiple focus across the state, excuse me, in multiple focus groups hosted by CDE staff.

36:21.090 --> 36:35.997
They were critical in providing guidance to our Standards Advisory Committee and the Standards Writer to ensure that the World Languages Standards reflect 21st century world language education programs that promote linguistic, global, and intercultural competency for all learners.

36:36.738 --> 36:48.364
Some of the key guidelines that informed and are now embedded in the World Languages Standards include use of language that aligns our work in California with the field of world language education nationally,

36:49.424 --> 36:54.985
Clearly emphasize delivering world languages instruction, primarily in the target language.

36:55.885 --> 37:02.347
Provide guidance for fostering multilingualism for California's unique and diverse student population, K-12.

37:03.667 --> 37:11.929
Foster the development of students' linguistic proficiency and interculturality throughout the teaching and learning process, including through the use of authentic resources.

37:12.969 --> 37:17.830
Provide learners with regular opportunities for interaction in real world contexts.

37:18.751 --> 37:23.343
and specifically address the unique context and needs of dual immersion programs.

37:26.812 --> 37:27.474
That skipped.

37:29.844 --> 37:32.446
No, the highlight standards, is it the next one?

37:32.786 --> 37:33.767
Okay, I'll do this one first.

37:36.348 --> 37:39.491
The standards are organized for ease of access by all users.

37:40.611 --> 37:52.460
Each standard is presented first with its name, in this case, Communication Standard 7, Language Comparisons in the Service of Communication, and then the goal or goals of that particular standard.

37:53.180 --> 38:01.888
And then an easy-to-read chart describing what students demonstrate that they know and can do in the different ranges of proficiency for that standard.

38:03.330 --> 38:14.020
Some of the highlights of the standards are that the 2019 California World Languages Standards incorporate all five domains of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages.

38:15.205 --> 38:24.072
However, in our California World Languages Standards, the communities and connections domains have been incorporated within the communications standard.

38:24.592 --> 38:31.838
And the reason for this change is that the communities and connections domains are integral components of proficient communication.

38:32.578 --> 38:47.006
So rather than separate them out, the standards integrate the skills and knowledge of interacting within and across target language communities and making connections to home language as well as to other disciplinary studies into the primary domain of communication.

38:48.207 --> 38:59.255
These world languages standards are aligned with and support recent legislation and initiatives that establish a path for students to become multilingual, develop intercultural competence, and become global citizens.

39:00.035 --> 39:11.664
In addition to fostering students' readiness to become multilingual and attain California's seal of biliteracy, these standards also provide guidance in light of both Proposition 58, education for a global economy, or EDGE,

39:12.524 --> 39:15.266
and Global California 2030 Speak Learn Lead.

39:15.786 --> 39:39.100
The standards support local education agencies to respond to the charge of both of these initiatives by promoting multilingualism for all learners through access to high-quality, well-articulated world language programs, providing language learning early in the elementary schools, ensuring availability of a wider range of world languages offered K-12, and outlining a streamlined progression of language acquisition from elementary through high school and beyond.

39:40.120 --> 39:48.647
The World Languages Standards illustrate necessary shifts in instructional approaches intended to have a positive impact on world language acquisition.

39:49.447 --> 39:57.233
The standards offer a vision of practices that are likely to bring out optimal performance among students in the world language classrooms.

39:57.994 --> 40:07.100
And one of the ways this becomes apparent is in the then and now chart, which is highlighted in the appendix called Ways Students May Access the World Languages Standards.

40:08.337 --> 40:15.121
These shifts that are in the then and now chart are recognized by world languages experts and are emphasized in the literature in the field.

40:15.882 --> 40:22.146
And they respond to a field wide call to action to create more inclusive learning environments.

40:22.986 --> 40:26.389
The chart includes 15 shifts, two of which are highlighted here.

40:27.009 --> 40:32.733
Number 10, back then in the day, it was the same instruction for all students, but now

40:33.593 --> 40:50.045
Teachers are charged with differentiating instruction to meet individual needs by differentiating based on student learning profiles, readiness, and interests, differentiating content processes and products, and differentiating for various types of learners, disengaged learners, students with disabilities, accelerated students, and heritage and native speakers.

40:51.626 --> 40:53.808
Or number 15, the shift.

40:54.308 --> 40:57.791
Back then, it was the students turned in work for the teacher.

40:59.278 --> 41:05.941
But now, learners create to share and publish for target culture audiences.

41:07.022 --> 41:15.526
This means publishing for and interacting with individuals who don't just know the words of the language, but who are immersed in the cultural values and perspectives.

41:16.026 --> 41:21.589
Because regardless of the words chosen, it is one's culture that determines interpretation.

41:22.802 --> 41:26.024
Thus, becoming proficient in a language actually requires more than words.

41:26.464 --> 41:28.505
It means developing this interculturality.

41:29.026 --> 41:47.437
So as highlighted in the Now column, the World Languages Standards call on teachers to ensure that learners have authentic language experiences by interacting with authentic documents from cultures that speak the language and directly with members of target cultures in a variety of settings and for a variety of purposes, rather than exclusively turning in work for the teacher.

41:48.317 --> 42:02.709
The research-based practices reflected in the now column highlight instruction that serves all students well and encourage world language teachers to utilize these principles to provide each and every student with access to grade level standards.

42:03.089 --> 42:04.911
I'm going to turn it back over to Dr. Gregson.

42:06.974 --> 42:13.420
So we are currently beginning the work of the World Languages Framework and depending on funding we expect state board action in May 2020.

42:13.821 --> 42:21.107
The framework will be based on the standards and the guidelines developed from the 2018 focus groups of teachers across the state in public comment.

42:21.668 --> 42:26.332
We look forward to working with partners on providing quality professional learning to our administrators and teachers.

42:26.793 --> 42:30.396
As we know this will help increase effective implementation at the classroom level.

42:31.621 --> 42:34.644
I'd like to conclude our presentation with this quote from Nelson Mandela.

42:35.344 --> 42:38.707
If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head.

42:39.568 --> 42:41.970
If you talk to him in his own language, that goes to his heart.

42:42.770 --> 42:50.857
When we think about each and every student we serve, they come with the strength of understanding all types of languages, including world languages and the arts.

42:51.338 --> 42:56.322
It is our duty to ensure they have the pathway to explore that language, whatever it may be.

42:58.086 --> 43:08.432
And that is why we bring to you the Instructional Quality Commission and the California Department of Education recommendation for the California Arts Standards and the California World Languages Standards.

43:10.767 --> 43:18.749
Can you make sure to clarify what the recommendation says in terms of the actions, because this is not a final action.

43:18.869 --> 43:19.129
Yes.

43:19.209 --> 43:20.429
What are you asking us today?

43:20.829 --> 43:30.311
So for item one, the California Arts Standards, the California Department of Education and the Instructional Quality Commission recommend that the State Board adopt the draft California Arts Standards.

43:32.311 --> 43:39.593
And for item two, the California Department of Education and the Instructional Quality Commission recommend that the State Board adopt the draft World Languages Standards.

43:40.899 --> 43:41.940
Okay, good.

43:42.140 --> 43:42.841
All right.

43:43.322 --> 43:44.003
Any comment?

43:44.203 --> 43:46.846
Our liaison, Board Member Sandoval.

43:48.443 --> 43:53.665
I just want to express my appreciation and support for the draft art standards.

43:54.966 --> 44:05.330
The fact that access and equity is the way we're looking at everything in a holistic manner is impressive.

44:05.390 --> 44:11.153
I just think of separate chapters on access and equity and frameworks, which I love those chapters.

44:11.993 --> 44:28.360
But now it's throughout the document, the standards, and I think this is evidence of alignment with different communities and cultures in California, but also within the department, and alignment with the special education team.

44:29.080 --> 44:37.043
And it's showing how alignment with curriculum and instruction is making good sense, and we're seeing the results of that in this outstanding work.

44:37.743 --> 44:44.189
So, I'm moving approval of the California Art Standards draft as recommended by the CDE.

44:44.209 --> 44:46.751
Okay.

44:46.791 --> 44:48.152
Further board member comments?

44:48.192 --> 44:48.993
Board member Rucker.

44:51.755 --> 44:52.696
Is there a second on that?

45:08.490 --> 45:08.850
Okay.

45:09.111 --> 45:09.651
Can you hear me?

45:10.451 --> 45:11.152
All right.

45:11.352 --> 45:19.197
I also want to add my commendation to the work that the IQC in particular, each of the subject matter committees have done.

45:19.758 --> 45:29.905
I also want to note in talking about equity and access, by virtue of the fact that we've added these particular topics in particular to world language,

45:30.345 --> 45:33.088
it has broadened the conversation of access.

45:33.508 --> 45:43.858
When we think about foreign language and students who take foreign language courses, that's a particular type of student on a particular type of trajectory after they leave the high school.

45:44.478 --> 45:47.982
What has happened in this framework is that we've changed the ideals

45:48.562 --> 46:08.556
of access for all students who are having not only to have an interest in learning language, but to change the expectation that all students not only can have access to learning language, but that it would become a norm for looking at and acquiring a second language, whether they are choosing to go to college after high school or not.

46:08.996 --> 46:16.802
It also changes the conversation for how we create that access for students who don't traditionally go into foreign language courses.

46:17.162 --> 46:24.208
particularly students with disabilities or students who have very particular physical access needs.

46:24.528 --> 46:44.203
And so it was wonderful not only to hear the conversation that the commissioners had, but to listen to how very purposefully they studied and revised those standards with it in mind to make sure that this access not only became universal, but became an expectation about what a new norm would be on language learning and language access.

46:44.243 --> 46:46.325
So I highly commend this framework.

46:49.065 --> 46:49.726
Okay, I know.

46:49.846 --> 46:53.590
Board Member Valdez, do you want to make a comment as liaison on moral languages?

46:53.750 --> 46:54.010
Yeah.

46:55.896 --> 47:06.340
Excuse me, Mr. President, because of the requirement for public comment and separate votes, I would advise moving to public comment on item one and then voting on the motion that's on the floor before moving to the wall.

47:06.360 --> 47:09.801
Public comment on item one and two.

47:09.901 --> 47:11.842
Item one, we're all only on item one.

47:13.043 --> 47:13.463
Item one.

47:13.643 --> 47:19.425
We have two speakers signed up for item one, Christine Alexander and Martha Diaz.

47:29.346 --> 47:29.887
Good morning.

47:29.947 --> 47:36.293
I'm Christine Alexander, Executive Director of the California Arts Project, the subject matter project for the arts in California.

47:37.094 --> 47:47.725
We're in full support of the arts standards and for the endless creative possibilities it brings our students and our teachers to fulfill their dreams.

47:48.345 --> 47:49.967
So we urge approval.

47:50.247 --> 47:50.568
Thank you.

47:50.668 --> 47:51.349
And we're excited.

47:56.892 --> 48:04.099
Good morning, Martha Zaragoza Diaz, and I'm representing the California Music Educators Association, also known as CMEA.

48:04.719 --> 48:12.867
I am pleased to say that CMEA supports the draft art standards based on the national core art standards and tailored for the California context.

48:13.487 --> 48:26.758
Beyond creativity and artistic literacy in arts education has a beneficial effect in many areas, such as improving school attendance and school climate, improving academic achievement and college going rates.

48:26.978 --> 48:34.864
But most importantly, the arts promote higher self-esteem, connectedness to school and social emotional development.

48:35.104 --> 48:41.509
It is for these reasons that CMEA supports these draft standards and requests your approval of them as well.

48:41.850 --> 48:42.130
Thank you.

48:43.797 --> 48:50.739
Okay, that concludes the public comment on item one, so I think we're... Any further board discussion on this item?

48:51.600 --> 48:53.480
If not, all those in favor, raise your hands.

48:53.860 --> 48:55.301
That passes unanimously.

48:55.781 --> 48:57.102
Now we're ready for item two.

48:57.242 --> 48:58.162
Board member Valdez.

49:01.678 --> 49:06.780
So I, too, want to commend you on the work that you're doing for the draft world language standards.

49:07.540 --> 49:13.182
When you want to solve a problem, you always want to get closest to the people who are closest to the problem or to the work, and those are the teachers.

49:13.222 --> 49:20.684
And so I really want to commend you for the work and the effort of all of the groups, because it really has built a community and a capacity for the future.

49:21.144 --> 49:24.906
And so that is a real hallmark of the work that you continue to do.

49:25.486 --> 49:28.407
And the fact that the standards were developed with that lens of equity.

49:29.247 --> 49:29.848
and access.

49:30.068 --> 49:36.292
When I'm having a bad day, I'm an assistant superintendent in the district, I go to Mrs. Huerta's second grade class at Hammett Elementary.

49:36.593 --> 49:47.121
She's a dual immersion teacher and it is so wonderful to just sit and be and see how successful all children can be at an early age in terms of language.

49:47.481 --> 49:53.786
And this is going to provide such guidance and support as a resource, the work that you're doing and the continued work.

49:53.826 --> 49:53.926
So

49:54.626 --> 49:59.231
I, too, make the recommendation, or I'd like to make the recommendation on item two to move forward.

49:59.591 --> 49:59.892
Thank you.

50:00.392 --> 50:00.953
For a second?

50:01.233 --> 50:01.573
Second.

50:05.077 --> 50:06.398
Maybe we'll have public comment.

50:08.220 --> 50:10.482
We have five speakers for item two.

50:10.803 --> 50:17.209
Duarte Silva, Sally Mearns, Martha Diaz, Marlene Batista, and Tonya Zalone.

50:24.522 --> 50:25.002
Good morning.

50:26.002 --> 50:35.164
My name is Duarte Silva, and I direct the California Award of Language Project at Stanford University that provides professional development opportunities for language teachers statewide.

50:35.984 --> 50:38.185
We fully endorse these standards.

50:38.565 --> 50:41.125
We watched the process by which they were developed.

50:41.345 --> 50:51.347
We were superbly amazed of all the issues that we have faced in professional learning issues in the field, how they came to the fore, and how these standards address each one of those.

50:51.947 --> 51:03.453
We very much look forward to using these standards to plan the professional learning opportunities for the future for these languages and support everything that we have in our vision for world language education in the state.

51:03.793 --> 51:08.155
For all those reasons, I support fully the vote for these standards.

51:08.535 --> 51:13.677
And I thank the board for your past support of world language education in California.

51:14.058 --> 51:14.398
Thank you.

51:20.703 --> 51:21.784
My name is Sally Mearns.

51:21.844 --> 51:31.992
I'm the director of the Stanford World Language Project, and I was also fortunate enough to be on the Standards Advisory Committee for World Languages, which was a tremendous experience.

51:32.513 --> 51:39.779
The group that we worked with was very representative from all over the state, multiple languages, multiple levels and roles.

51:40.719 --> 51:43.622
and amazingly cooperative.

51:44.022 --> 51:57.715
The consensus came very easily because these were such dedicated teachers, educators, and I think because of that and the way we were willing to listen to each other, we came out with a very fine document.

51:59.142 --> 52:07.869
My particular focus, because I work with teachers in the World Language Project, we do professional development for teachers all over the state.

52:08.749 --> 52:13.453
And what I love about this document is that it is so teacher friendly.

52:13.913 --> 52:22.940
You don't have to slog through a great deal of vocabulary and unknown concepts.

52:23.140 --> 52:26.703
It's very clear what we are expecting in the standards.

52:27.723 --> 52:41.192
And because I'm teaching teachers, I like this idea that it's going to be much easier to guide our teachers in the new standards and the new world of language teaching in many ways.

52:41.652 --> 52:44.053
I do recommend that we adopt this.

52:44.354 --> 52:44.674
Thank you.

52:51.101 --> 52:51.641
Good morning.

52:51.741 --> 52:52.782
I'm Tanya Zaccone.

52:52.902 --> 52:56.965
I'm the executive director of the California Language Teachers Association.

52:57.625 --> 53:08.493
And as a representative of the actual teachers on the ground, you might say, on the front lines, I am very excited that these standards are user-friendly.

53:09.113 --> 53:25.222
And I really have a great dream that one day we will have documents, and I believe this will be one, that will not be on somebody's shelf or in somebody's trunk of their car or in the closet of something that in the second story of their house.

53:26.002 --> 53:30.686
This will actually be usable and friendly to our teachers.

53:31.366 --> 53:46.138
And I think as much as I would like to talk here for hours, I really want to stress one more important point for teachers and for all of us in California, and that is our dream of having global citizens.

53:47.319 --> 53:55.585
for everyone, every single student to have that right to be educated, to become a global citizen.

53:55.605 --> 54:00.889
You cannot do that without language and, the most important, culture.

54:01.730 --> 54:05.533
So, these standards are warming my heart.

54:06.434 --> 54:13.026
And I'm pleased to represent the teachers of California and recommend adoption.

54:13.106 --> 54:16.933
Thank you so much for your time and all your work and for your past support.

54:17.213 --> 54:17.514
Thank you.

54:22.128 --> 54:22.608
Good morning.

54:23.069 --> 54:28.873
Martha Zaragoza-Diaz, and I'm representing the California Association for Bilingual Education and Californians Together.

54:29.393 --> 54:33.937
We seek your approval of the World Languages Standards as recommended by CDE staff.

54:34.377 --> 54:46.266
These standards will provide guidance to teachers and educators in implementing 21st century world language education programs that promote linguistic, global, and intercultural competency.

54:47.766 --> 55:03.291
They can also be used to support all language educators, including those who work in the area of English language development and multilingual education, where language instruction supports content area instruction, English, and target language development.

55:03.651 --> 55:14.415
These standards link communicative proficiency and intercultural competence to college and career readiness, including a path toward attaining the state seal of biliteracy.

55:14.995 --> 55:21.137
These are some of the reasons we support the World Languages Standards and seek your approval to do so as well.

55:21.438 --> 55:21.738
Thank you.

55:21.758 --> 55:24.539
Okay.

55:25.299 --> 55:26.480
Public comment concluded.

55:26.540 --> 55:27.380
Board Member Sandoval.

55:29.011 --> 55:30.593
I just, I had a brief comment.

55:31.033 --> 55:39.243
I really am grateful that this, that the standards really embrace all languages in California.

55:39.764 --> 55:48.494
And I think of coming from an indigenous community where in Santa Ynez where we have credentialed teachers for our indigenous language and how we're teaching the children.

55:49.194 --> 55:57.780
And I have three younger siblings in our family who are in a dual immersion Spanish-English program, but they're also learning our Samoan language.

55:57.840 --> 56:03.083
So we have trilingual global citizens in our community and my own family.

56:03.784 --> 56:05.205
And the future is beautiful.

56:05.925 --> 56:09.988
And I am fully supportive of the adoption of this draft.

56:12.568 --> 56:12.808
Thank you.

56:14.049 --> 56:15.511
No further comments by the board.

56:16.471 --> 56:19.014
We're ready for a vote on approving item two.

56:19.734 --> 56:20.715
All those who raise your hands.

56:20.735 --> 56:21.956
Okay.

56:22.036 --> 56:22.457
Thank you.

56:22.497 --> 56:23.578
Approved unanimously.

56:23.738 --> 56:24.439
Thank you for that.

56:24.639 --> 56:26.220
And we're ready for item three.

56:34.284 --> 56:42.292
Yeah, before the presentation by C.D., Jeff Beshears, I want to say that these are largely

56:42.970 --> 56:56.241
technical changes to the local control accountability plan inspired by the federal Every Student Succeeds Act and to conform with them in that regard.

56:56.621 --> 57:11.173
I want to point out that the fiscal 2018 budget package included trailer bill language requiring more extensive revisions of the LCAP template and those requirements will go into effect for 2020

57:14.496 --> 57:14.576
and 2021.

57:15.958 --> 57:29.914
So this is a technical issue, but the future board will really have to open up the whole LCAP again, and that's appropriate, and look at it in a more holistic way.

57:30.175 --> 57:32.417
And so that'll be a big item in the future.

57:33.098 --> 57:33.459
Go ahead.

57:33.579 --> 57:34.119
Thank you.

57:35.180 --> 57:39.305
Well, good morning, President Kirst, Superintendent Thurmond, members of the board.

57:39.345 --> 57:42.649
I'm Jeff Breshears, the director of the local agency system support office.

57:43.250 --> 57:44.531
Item three is an action item.

57:44.971 --> 57:48.836
The California Department of Education is proposing edits to the LCAP template

57:49.375 --> 57:52.277
for use in the 2019-2020 school year.

57:52.978 --> 58:12.012
These proposed edits are necessary to address school planning requirements of the Every Student Succeeds Act, to reduce duplication of effort for LEAs in completing the LCAP and the LCFF budget overview for parents, and also to make minor conforming changes to the addendum and appendices in the LCAP template.

58:13.753 --> 58:25.616
Also, in a continued effort to reduce duplication of effort for LEAs, the CDE requests consideration to remove the increased or improved services prompt in the LCAP plan summary section.

58:26.297 --> 58:34.779
This information is fully addressed in the demonstration of increased or improved services for unduplicated students section in the LCAP.

58:35.780 --> 58:46.959
Partly continue on with the background that President Kirst began with and to provide a little bit of context and how the LCAP fits into this broader system of integrated accountability and improvement system.

58:47.745 --> 58:58.673
With the first LCAP template adopted in 2014, and even our current LCAP template, which was adopted in 2016, the LCAP was the only fully implemented component of the LCFF.

58:59.354 --> 59:15.546
Since that time, we have, you have adopted the California School Dashboard, the adoption of the ESSA State Plan, and it's demonstrative of the goal to develop an integrated and improvement system grounded in LCFF that meets both the state and federal requirements.

59:16.326 --> 59:27.773
Consistent with LCFF, the core premise of this work is that the LEA is the primary unit of change, and it plays a key role in supporting its students and the student opportunities for outcomes.

59:29.114 --> 59:41.101
With that, the priority is to promote a single planning process grounded in the LCAP to include the school planning process, local indicators, including the self-reflection tools, and this year, the LEA plan.

59:42.256 --> 59:50.426
As a requirement to receive certain federal funds under ESSA, LEAs must develop the LEA plan this year in conjunction with the development of the LCAP.

59:51.928 --> 59:59.177
As a reminder, the template for that plan, the LCAP Federal Addendum, is unchanged from what the State Board adopted at its March 2018 meeting.

01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:15.514
The existing school planning process has been updated to better align with the LCAP and the LCAP planning process and to meet federal school level planning and improvement requirements.

01:00:16.475 --> 01:00:25.758
Beginning with the 2019-2020 school year, the LEAs will also develop an LCFF budget overview for parents.

01:00:26.419 --> 01:00:27.359
The budget overview

01:00:29.264 --> 01:00:39.527
will be developed in tandem with the LCAP and is a new document that provides context of an LEA's revenue, planned expenditures, and how those expenditures are reflected in the LCAP.

01:00:40.612 --> 01:00:55.658
So the LCAP with the recommended changes is a foundational tool for a single planning process, maintaining the focus on the LEA as a primary driver for change with a clearer focus on how LEAs are supporting its schools within that process.

01:00:56.278 --> 01:00:58.619
So with that, let's look at some of the details, please.

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:06.823
The budget summary information currently in the LCAP plan summary is now included in the budget overview for parents.

01:01:07.203 --> 01:01:09.064
So this information is now redundant.

01:01:10.373 --> 01:01:17.820
The comprehensive support and improvement prompt addresses the ESSA requirements for school planning and will be addressed in later slides.

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:22.844
And then we need to make some minor conforming changes to the instructions and the appendices.

01:01:23.484 --> 01:01:34.174
Also, as previously mentioned, in an effort to reduce duplication of efforts, we'd ask you to like to consider removing the increased or improved services prompt from the LCAP plan summary.

01:01:42.639 --> 01:01:52.775
The CDE sought feedback from stakeholders with the LCFF stakeholders meetings, the ESSA implementation webinars, as well as our Tuesdays at 2 webinars.

01:01:53.652 --> 01:01:58.574
I'd like to acknowledge the need for support in the field in developing plans in the school planning process.

01:01:59.115 --> 01:02:13.322
The CDE is developing a continuation of Tuesdays at 2 webinars to support school planning, the budget overview for parents, and integrating local indicators and the self-reflection tools into the LCAP planning process to help make these plans as strong as possible.

01:02:17.704 --> 01:02:19.265
Each of the changes, each of the

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:27.153
Items here in the template will not be affected by the changes requested in the LCAP template.

01:02:28.054 --> 01:02:33.797
Also, as I said before, as a reminder, the LCAP Federal Attendant Template remains unchanged.

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:47.465
Again, newly adopted Assembly Bill 1808 created the LCFF Budget Overview for Parents, adding Section 52064.1 to the Education Code.

01:02:53.177 --> 01:02:59.359
So what's in the budget overview plan summary is here that's also in the budget overview for parents.

01:02:59.419 --> 01:03:19.584
It includes a prompt regarding the general fund budget expenditures, the funds budgeted for planned actions and services to meet the goals within the LCAP, projected LCFF revenues for the year, and then a brief description of the activities or programs supported by general fund expenditures that are not included in the LCAP.

01:03:21.997 --> 01:03:24.521
So here's a busy screen for you and a busy slide for you.

01:03:24.741 --> 01:03:29.648
On the left-hand side is the current plan summary with the budget summary prompts.

01:03:30.369 --> 01:03:35.858
The boxes and arrows show where those prompts will go into the budget overview for parents.

01:03:36.462 --> 01:03:44.487
The right hand side is a data input section or page for the LEAs to input these numbers and information.

01:03:44.927 --> 01:03:52.372
The actual public facing template or the budget overview for parents is a lot more visual pleasing.

01:03:52.752 --> 01:04:00.437
It has graphs representing these numbers as well as the narrative responses by the LEAs.

01:04:01.858 --> 01:04:05.380
Similarly on this page is again the prompt about

01:04:05.765 --> 01:04:10.306
the budget, general budget expenditures that aren't included in the LCAP.

01:04:10.786 --> 01:04:10.886
Oh.

01:04:13.687 --> 01:04:14.227
Sorry about that.

01:04:14.247 --> 01:04:14.507
Thanks.

01:04:15.487 --> 01:04:20.588
So again, those are on the left hand side is the prompt that is currently in the budget summary.

01:04:20.988 --> 01:04:31.791
Move it into the right hand side, which is again, data input for the budget overview for parents and that narrative response, again, which will be outward facing for the budget overview for parents.

01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:59.467
So what we'd like to add and we're asking you to add is then prompts for the comprehensive support and improvement prompts or CSI prompts as part of the ESSA school planning requirements and the requirement of the LEAs role in supporting the development of school plans and how LEAs will monitor and evaluate the implementation and the effectiveness of those CSI school plans.

01:05:00.428 --> 01:05:04.371
Ultimately, the State Board gives final approval of these CSI plans.

01:05:04.591 --> 01:05:06.553
I will share our plan and

01:05:07.875 --> 01:05:13.617
for the ultimate approval in the next slide and then show the CSI prompts in a more readable manner.

01:05:15.797 --> 01:05:25.100
So the school site council with the support of the LEA develops the school plan for student achievement or the school plan, which includes the CSI planning requirements.

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:35.363
The local governing board then approves the school plan and summarizes its support in this plan summary of the LCAP and approves the school plan

01:05:37.429 --> 01:05:41.111
sorry, through the CSI planning prompts in the LCAP plan summary.

01:05:41.472 --> 01:05:45.114
The COE then approves the LCAP, including the CSI plan summary.

01:05:45.734 --> 01:05:55.981
In addition to reviewing these prompts, the COEs are charged with providing technical assistance to support LEAs in developing the school plans, and they receive funding to do that work.

01:05:56.741 --> 01:06:10.804
The CDE will then collect a list of LEAs from the county offices with LCAPs that have been approved from LEAs that have those schools identified for CSI and ultimately will bring that list to you to the state board for approval.

01:06:12.782 --> 01:06:18.706
So here's the prompts that are included or asked to be included in the LCAP plan summary.

01:06:19.386 --> 01:06:20.487
And its way is feedback.

01:06:20.507 --> 01:06:29.732
The first prompt was an option that we sought from the public is, do we ask for the number of schools that have been identified or to identify the schools?

01:06:29.792 --> 01:06:34.555
And overwhelmingly, the report and the suggestion was to list the schools

01:06:40.802 --> 01:07:00.712
So again, the CDE recommends that the State Board of Education adopt the proposed revised LCAP and annual update template, which is attachment 2, and allow the CDE in collaboration with the State Board staff to make any necessary typographical or formatting corrections as the document is prepared for the posting on the CDE website.

01:07:01.152 --> 01:07:09.977
I'd also like to note that the attachment 2 does reflect the request to remove the increase for improved services prompt from the LCAP plan summary.

01:07:11.681 --> 01:07:11.861
All right.

01:07:11.981 --> 01:07:13.561
Thank you, Jeff.

01:07:13.741 --> 01:07:16.962
Board Member Burr is our liaison for this area.

01:07:18.983 --> 01:07:20.463
Thank you, President Kirst.

01:07:20.983 --> 01:07:25.904
First, I just want to express my appreciation to both the department staff and the board staff for their work on this.

01:07:27.124 --> 01:07:31.385
I think they did a great job in a tweener situation.

01:07:32.025 --> 01:07:35.266
Because as you pointed out, there is subsequent legislation that's really going to

01:07:35.946 --> 01:07:43.169
I think give us the opportunity that we do need to sort of open up the whole thing and say, how do we make this a more effective document?

01:07:43.229 --> 01:07:47.331
How do we get LEAs to believe that this is really your strategic plan?

01:07:47.391 --> 01:07:50.832
It's not another compliance document that you put on the shelf.

01:07:51.313 --> 01:07:54.134
But in the meantime, this is what we're tasked with doing.

01:07:54.694 --> 01:08:20.032
and all of you know what a great fan I am of the federal law, but this does a good job of navigating what we're required to do under federal law while still retaining the very clear message that it's the LEA's responsibility to provide the kinds of support and services to schools that are struggling, not the states to reach down and try to deal with individual schools.

01:08:21.132 --> 01:08:26.073
In any event, I think you did a great job for this interim period of time.

01:08:26.773 --> 01:08:28.794
And I would move the department's recommendation.

01:08:28.814 --> 01:08:30.354
I'll second.

01:08:30.794 --> 01:08:33.575
Just with some comments since Member Burr and I work on this together.

01:08:34.055 --> 01:08:45.317
So as a former district leader who worked on these processes, I think we're moving in the right direction, as Member Burr said, and trying to combine the forms and combine the procedures.

01:08:45.437 --> 01:08:47.558
I still think we have a lot of work to do and I

01:08:48.318 --> 01:08:54.142
actually look forward to enthusiastically kind of streamlining this in the whole next iteration.

01:08:54.182 --> 01:09:01.407
But I appreciate, Jeff, so much you showing where it went and why with the charts and why we're moving it.

01:09:01.867 --> 01:09:11.834
And I think the stakeholder input and the people who live with these documents are really helpful to us in your feedback and the future feedback on how to make this more effective.

01:09:11.854 --> 01:09:16.237
And I think what Member Burr said about it being a strategic planning document, I think as a

01:09:17.057 --> 01:09:27.561
a district leader who worked on this and as a site leader, you don't want it to be just a document that you check, fill in the boxes and it's bureaucratic, which many people still see this process as.

01:09:27.982 --> 01:09:43.728
So as we continue to move to refine it and make it a working document that will lead the improvement and kind of guide the improvement process, I just appreciate so much that we're listening to stakeholders, their voices matter to us and that it become even more effective and also streamlined.

01:09:43.768 --> 01:09:45.529
So the areas that will be

01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:51.653
filled in that it actually is a time where we can make things connect and make it more meaningful.

01:09:52.033 --> 01:09:57.137
And then for parents and stakeholders to be able to find information and find data, find the budgets.

01:09:57.478 --> 01:10:00.460
So it's getting far more transparent about the work we do.

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:03.642
So I second the motion and approve.

01:10:03.943 --> 01:10:08.286
And again, as member Burr said, just to remind everybody is that we're going to do a full revision.

01:10:08.406 --> 01:10:09.567
This is just the tweener.

01:10:10.147 --> 01:10:16.691
We're not going to try to do this every year, but there's a full revision that comes with some more legal language that we must do based on legislation.

01:10:17.272 --> 01:10:17.612
Thank you.

01:10:18.933 --> 01:10:23.736
Yeah, I wanted to add a description that we have been

01:10:24.945 --> 01:10:34.210
working on making the LCAP more transparent in terms of where the money is going within the local districts.

01:10:35.211 --> 01:10:52.721
And the legislature and the executive branch agreed in the budget bill on this budget increase for parents and public and interested citizens to crosswalk between the LCAP over here, the local control accountability,

01:10:53.081 --> 01:11:01.182
and the regular budget, general budget, over here so that people can see in the LCAP where it's reflected in the general budget.

01:11:01.663 --> 01:11:03.483
That is not in this proposal.

01:11:03.903 --> 01:11:10.184
But there's a start on that in this proposal, as Jeff Beshears pointed out.

01:11:10.384 --> 01:11:12.905
But there'll be more to come in that area.

01:11:13.405 --> 01:11:20.146
And I think that will begin to change the dialogue about the fiscal transparency in the LCAP.

01:11:20.766 --> 01:11:24.068
So that'll be work for the board going forward.

01:11:25.289 --> 01:11:29.212
And we appreciate the legislation that helped us work on this.

01:11:29.892 --> 01:11:33.375
So I think we better other than board comments, board member.

01:11:35.216 --> 01:11:36.157
Yeah.

01:11:36.197 --> 01:11:36.537
Thank you.

01:11:36.577 --> 01:11:49.427
So I just wanted to echo board member Strauss comments around appreciation for the reduction of the redundancy and the shaping of the LCAP template up until this point.

01:11:50.088 --> 01:11:54.051
Someone who's looking forward to completing the next one in the spring.

01:11:54.071 --> 01:12:02.658
And I also want to go that we are still a ways off to really make this clearly understandable to our stakeholders.

01:12:03.118 --> 01:12:18.366
So, you know, I imagine something that what we did to revamp our dashboard, we will need to look at some design, even just moving that this last one with the template where there's the column rather than this kind of narrow linear really is going to be helpful.

01:12:18.466 --> 01:12:20.887
So appreciate the work that you continue to work on this.

01:12:21.027 --> 01:12:22.888
And we will definitely have to do more.

01:12:22.908 --> 01:12:25.370
Board Member Holliday.

01:12:26.890 --> 01:12:31.973
And in that future iteration of the LCAP helping

01:12:33.851 --> 01:12:50.707
along with transparency, not only by positioning and including numbers, but also language and worrying about how some of these prompts are written, such as briefly describe any of the general fund, you know, the words like briefly and any.

01:12:51.627 --> 01:13:03.216
may not be sending the correct message that the board wants to send to a district when they are faced with parents who don't understand the general fund and need more information.

01:13:07.579 --> 01:13:08.500
Board Member Valdez.

01:13:10.673 --> 01:13:11.153
Thank you, Jeff.

01:13:11.453 --> 01:13:15.915
I love moving the budget summary and also the increased and improved services section.

01:13:15.935 --> 01:13:22.696
I'm hoping now that the LCAP will read more like a story and not so, you know, just sectioned off, if you will.

01:13:23.036 --> 01:13:28.478
And I think the iterations and these intentional changes are just making it so much a better document over time.

01:13:29.138 --> 01:13:35.180
But each decision has served a purpose, and so we are streamlining, and we do need to eliminate redundancy.

01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:39.381
And I think that is really critical, especially in the spirit of transparency.

01:13:40.241 --> 01:13:55.687
So with that, I am a fan of simplification, and in my day job, I get the required opportunity, right, to participate in, and I have done this since the beginning, and so I feel like it's, I have a relationship, if you will, with the LCAP at a different level.

01:13:56.187 --> 01:14:00.629
And so at the end of the day, though, it's not about the form, it's about the function.

01:14:01.009 --> 01:14:04.270
And so it's gonna be a real challenge to really look at

01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:17.033
You know, you have the LCAP, the LCAP addendum, which you haven't talked about, as well as then now the school plan and the CSI plan and they're all, but it's really getting those to be integrated because they still are sections.

01:14:17.093 --> 01:14:27.416
And so it's that idea, the mindset to bring all of these together to then ask of the educational agency, local education agency, how are you helping the school

01:14:27.916 --> 01:14:29.197
help the students succeed.

01:14:29.257 --> 01:14:30.358
And that's the framework.

01:14:30.378 --> 01:14:33.682
So it's not the gotcha, but it's just really, really how are we doing it?

01:14:33.702 --> 01:14:40.288
And we have to be really brave and clear in the plan so that everyone can wrap their arms around it and understand it.

01:14:40.368 --> 01:14:41.569
So I thank you for what you're doing.

01:14:41.809 --> 01:14:42.149
Thank you.

01:14:44.552 --> 01:14:45.753
Board member Otis Lacone.

01:14:47.011 --> 01:14:47.491
Thank you.

01:14:47.752 --> 01:14:51.915
And I agree with everything that has been said, but sometimes form does dictate function.

01:14:52.555 --> 01:14:56.959
And so it's important for for me when I'm looking at the changes.

01:14:57.039 --> 01:15:00.702
And I really like that we're listing the CSI schools.

01:15:00.802 --> 01:15:02.823
We were always wondering they're not on the dashboard.

01:15:02.903 --> 01:15:06.546
How will a parent know that their school has been identified?

01:15:06.606 --> 01:15:06.826
Right.

01:15:06.866 --> 01:15:08.308
And so this is a good opportunity.

01:15:08.848 --> 01:15:15.013
My only concern and I think it has to do more with the fact that so many people have said this feels like compliance.

01:15:15.433 --> 01:15:26.799
And if you're treating a document like compliance, then it's hard for me to believe that that will be a living document that we'll use for your technical assistance and for your continuous improvement, right?

01:15:26.839 --> 01:15:37.325
And so I'm looking at support for identified schools, and it's the LEAs are supposed to provide a brief description of how they supported the schools that have been identified.

01:15:37.945 --> 01:15:50.756
Well, if I'm reading my LCAP as I am a parent, if I'm reading my district's LCAP and I see this is how they supported the schools that have been identified, I still don't know why those schools were identified, right?

01:15:50.796 --> 01:15:55.781
And so does the support align with the reason for identification?

01:15:56.201 --> 01:15:56.701
I don't know.

01:15:57.162 --> 01:16:14.271
And there's no way that I could know unless every school plan is hyperlinked to the schools that have been identified or there's a way for me to understand this is what prompted identification and this was the support that was provided at the LEA level.

01:16:14.672 --> 01:16:18.154
So I'm not sure where that would be identified in our current document.

01:16:18.674 --> 01:16:18.954
Thank you.

01:16:20.635 --> 01:16:21.736
Jeff, do you want to respond to that?

01:16:22.401 --> 01:16:27.283
Well, I would say I'm not sure how we'd make that link at this point.

01:16:27.323 --> 01:16:39.267
And certainly looking forward with our opportunity of revamping the LCAP for the next three year iterations starting in 2023 or 20 to 23 would be an opportunity to look at that as well.

01:16:39.807 --> 01:16:42.148
And I think that the school might also be addressed.

01:16:42.188 --> 01:16:48.010
Some of your concerns might be addressed in the ESSA item tomorrow when they talk about school identification.

01:16:49.131 --> 01:16:49.871
Board Member Rucker.

01:16:52.448 --> 01:16:56.490
Jeff, I want to add my commendation to the work that you've done.

01:16:56.850 --> 01:17:11.156
This is one of those activities that, because it's so highly technical and the level of detail is so discreet, that people get lost in the minutia of what's actually intended and what's actually being accomplished here.

01:17:11.756 --> 01:17:27.519
At the 5,000 foot level, what we have attempted to do is both streamline and align the multiple types of planning activities that the district and also the school sites are tasked to do in school planning.

01:17:27.939 --> 01:17:37.681
I think at the core of the concerns that I'm hearing being expressed is the fact that we are still learning as an education community

01:17:38.274 --> 01:17:51.350
how to have the conversation first about school planning and attempting to define in the LCAP what are the essential components that need to be in a narrative for a school plan.

01:17:52.011 --> 01:17:56.356
But in doing that, we're also trying to use the school plan

01:17:56.896 --> 01:17:59.237
to serve multiple purposes.

01:17:59.597 --> 01:18:07.581
Now I'm a former high school English teacher, and when I taught my students their writing activities, writing purposes were segregated.

01:18:07.641 --> 01:18:10.822
Writing to inform, writing to explain, writing to persuade.

01:18:11.302 --> 01:18:15.144
We're trying to use a single document for multiple purposes.

01:18:15.604 --> 01:18:20.787
and in conflating those multiple purposes into this document, that's how we're getting lost.

01:18:21.267 --> 01:18:33.134
And so I think we need to take some lessons from this transition moment and use that as some of our guidance in what we're going to do to revise the upcoming template.

01:18:33.554 --> 01:18:44.200
First of all, we need to make sure, and what I'm learning from what we've seen in this transition document, the document does a better job of giving to the district the charge

01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.361
of writing their narrative.

01:18:46.881 --> 01:19:02.865
What that tells me is that in putting this document out when it's approved today, that means we need to make sure our county offices that are giving advice and guidance to districts give them better guidance on what it means to be better writers of that narrative.

01:19:03.185 --> 01:19:07.847
Because that is still where the gap is in the guidance to implement this plan.

01:19:08.507 --> 01:19:33.796
The second part of this is then in looking at, now that we're transitioning to comprehensive support, the second piece of our conversation, as Board Member LeCone has pointed out, we need to make sure that we are clear and purposeful in understanding why schools were identified for support and making sure that districts not only clearly articulate the identification,

01:19:34.216 --> 01:19:41.421
But there is a clear alignment between the support plan and the reasons for the identification of those schools.

01:19:42.021 --> 01:19:48.766
And that's not quite well spelled out in the guidance that should accompany this template.

01:19:48.826 --> 01:19:52.388
And I think that that's where some more work needs to be done.

01:19:52.909 --> 01:19:54.330
We're not approving

01:19:55.730 --> 01:19:58.131
We're not approving concerted activities.

01:19:58.551 --> 01:20:01.052
We're approving an improved document.

01:20:01.432 --> 01:20:05.373
And so with approving this document, there is still, we're not done.

01:20:05.953 --> 01:20:06.834
Let me change that.

01:20:07.194 --> 01:20:17.397
Somebody else is not done with the work that they need to, that needs to be done to make this document, not just a living document, but a usable tool for districts.

01:20:17.757 --> 01:20:26.323
There is a mindset change and a shift in behavior that needs to accompany all these documents that are being revised.

01:20:26.843 --> 01:20:29.225
We can't mandate that mind shift.

01:20:29.565 --> 01:20:35.949
We can only say that there's an expectation, but that's where the conversation needs to start.

01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:39.612
When I was a high school English teacher and I gave my students back their

01:20:40.112 --> 01:20:50.356
assignments and I gave them an explanation about how I graded their work, a lot of them will say, well, if I had known this was your expectation, I would have done this.

01:20:50.756 --> 01:20:53.337
So we have adopted, we are going to adopt this template.

01:20:53.357 --> 01:20:54.798
We're going to adopt these changes.

01:20:55.178 --> 01:21:02.821
There needs to be a commensurate expectation of a mind shift change on how to do the work.

01:21:03.141 --> 01:21:08.523
Because if we do the same things we've always done, we're going to get the same kind of work we've always got.

01:21:08.543 --> 01:21:09.263
Thank you.

01:21:12.288 --> 01:21:25.338
Just to add, I think in the rethink of maybe how this template goes, we're still approaching these plans as if they are one dimensional and we're putting them on a piece of paper.

01:21:25.538 --> 01:21:30.102
And really these are so multidimensional that now these days we're thinking links.

01:21:30.242 --> 01:21:33.004
And so you get to one part, but you have to link to something else.

01:21:33.044 --> 01:21:33.244
And so

01:21:34.025 --> 01:21:45.452
flow charting what all the pieces need to go together and then what is that structure for us to get to those easily so that people can find information in all these different multiple ways.

01:21:45.573 --> 01:21:50.696
I think that's what we need to move to and not think about the plan as being a binder of pieces of paper.

01:21:51.914 --> 01:21:53.836
Yes, I agree.

01:21:54.417 --> 01:21:54.878
Thank you.

01:21:55.378 --> 01:22:04.590
That's also what we need to do with the LCAP expenditures for some of the problems we're talking about today in the regular budget.

01:22:04.630 --> 01:22:06.292
You can work links with it.

01:22:06.412 --> 01:22:07.053
Right, yeah.

01:22:08.535 --> 01:22:09.175
Board Member Burr.

01:22:10.036 --> 01:22:15.258
So just a couple things, and it's kind of advice, I think you're getting a lot of good advice about going forward.

01:22:15.878 --> 01:22:18.859
I reflect on where we started with the LCAP.

01:22:20.479 --> 01:22:35.844
I actually, maybe we should bring Janelle Kubanek back from WestEd who helped us develop, but I remember distinctly that one of the central themes around the LCAP was helping the LEAs tell their story about what their schools were doing.

01:22:36.344 --> 01:22:42.209
and we had a lot of guiding questions, and initially that was like, whoa, that seems like a lot.

01:22:42.309 --> 01:22:45.772
But we've learned a lot since the first LCAP.

01:22:45.893 --> 01:22:58.203
I think, I hope, I feel like this, we've developed a lot of trust among LEAs that we're not out to get them, we're not gonna come and fire your principals and all the terrible things we used to try to do under NCLB.

01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:14.910
But we are in a different era, and if we have developed a level of trust that says, yes, we are going to have a living document that tells our story, then I encourage us to kind of step back and go, well, was that an approach that made sense, and are we at a place now where that

01:23:15.670 --> 01:23:16.610
that can work.

01:23:17.131 --> 01:23:25.274
So because I worry a little bit, and I think we're hearing that in some of these comments, that this is part of our sedimentary geology.

01:23:25.374 --> 01:23:28.295
We build up layers and layers and layers.

01:23:28.375 --> 01:23:31.956
And the only way we can get to new places, we have to blow them up.

01:23:32.417 --> 01:23:37.058
And I don't want us to have to be there, but I do want us to have a fresh perspective as we go forward.

01:23:37.399 --> 01:23:38.139
So just a thought.

01:23:38.719 --> 01:23:42.962
But more specifically, I have kind of a technical question before we hear public comment.

01:23:43.002 --> 01:23:56.132
We got letters or one or more letters about a suggestion that we clean up the language apropos to Board Member Holliday and get rid of the term evaluation rubric because that was very confusing from the statute.

01:23:56.192 --> 01:23:58.073
And now that we're talking about the dashboard.

01:23:58.333 --> 01:24:04.538
So I hope we can do that at least in this revision as part of maybe the technical cleanup in the motion.

01:24:05.578 --> 01:24:07.239
Let me make a response to that.

01:24:07.259 --> 01:24:16.021
It is the only place that is also mentioned is in the annual update, which is part of the template that is not changed, right, is because of that three-year static.

01:24:16.061 --> 01:24:31.484
So I don't know how it would work, but certainly we could encourage the LEAs to change that within their template and we can change it everywhere outside of those core sections that are part of that three-year static plan, if you will, or inclusive plan.

01:24:33.533 --> 01:24:35.994
All right, I think we're ready for public comment.

01:24:36.274 --> 01:24:47.217
Just quickly on that point, the California school dashboard, the budget changes this past year actually added the dashboard into the education code, which was not true when the board adopted this template.

01:24:47.237 --> 01:24:51.138
I think that was, frankly, that was the limitation about referencing.

01:24:51.158 --> 01:25:02.042
So I believe it is possible in the, as Jeff said, in the plan summary, which is completed annually, making those, the three places, the evaluation rubrics or reference, being able to substitute that language if the board

01:25:02.702 --> 01:25:05.904
you know, move, for example, the CDE recommendation with that addition.

01:25:06.284 --> 01:25:12.287
But as Jeff said, it's also in the body of the template itself, which the department is not recommending that the board modify.

01:25:12.307 --> 01:25:20.872
So, you know, that would be one thing that the board would want to consider, whether to open up the body of that document, which is a three-year, covers all three years.

01:25:23.513 --> 01:25:24.134
Board member Valdez.

01:25:26.374 --> 01:25:32.618
I just have one clarification question, an unknown to me, is I see the questions for the summary and the LCAP for CSI, right?

01:25:32.658 --> 01:25:33.478
The three questions.

01:25:34.038 --> 01:25:34.619
Right.

01:25:34.639 --> 01:25:38.141
But what is the CSI plan going to look like in the school plan?

01:25:38.161 --> 01:25:39.882
And maybe we're going to talk about that tomorrow.

01:25:40.362 --> 01:25:41.202
What's the connection?

01:25:41.242 --> 01:25:46.365
So are these questions the relevant ones to have based on whatever that might look like, if that makes sense?

01:25:46.525 --> 01:26:06.710
Yeah, so I believe that the prompts are relevant into the school plans, and I'm not sure where we're going to go with the item tomorrow, but the school plan for student achievement will address those requirements and spell out those requirements to address any schools that have been identified for comprehensive support and intervention.

01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:13.992
So as the LEA supports the schools in developing those plans, they're involved in those plans, which is the school plan for student achievement.

01:26:14.732 --> 01:26:19.214
And again, the LEA then would be able to summarize that support within these prompts.

01:26:19.234 --> 01:26:20.754
So I think it is.

01:26:23.135 --> 01:26:24.175
All right, public comment.

01:26:25.096 --> 01:26:29.197
We have two speakers for item three, John Aifelt and Brian Rivas.

01:26:41.322 --> 01:26:42.142
Please come forward.

01:26:46.661 --> 01:26:47.582
Sorry, I was not on the list.

01:26:48.423 --> 01:26:50.106
Good morning, my name is Ephraim Mercado from Children Now.

01:26:50.466 --> 01:26:54.151
We really appreciate all the work done to improve the LCAP template.

01:26:54.171 --> 01:27:00.720
We're super supportive of a lot of the efforts within it and appreciate the efforts of the CDE and SB staff to obtain stakeholder.

01:27:03.102 --> 01:27:05.745
The inclusion of the CSI schools I think is key.

01:27:05.805 --> 01:27:11.571
The prompts are going to be very important as we continue to align the ESSA requirements with our state's LCFF approach.

01:27:12.532 --> 01:27:19.940
We understand the rationale for removing the budget summary piece as well as the increased and improved services and so we understand that piece.

01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:23.864
One piece that we are anxious about is the theory of action which how we

01:27:24.865 --> 01:27:29.849
align the CSI improvement efforts with the LCAP and the state oversight piece.

01:27:29.869 --> 01:27:41.179
And we understand that the crux of local control is the LEA and that is the change agent, but given the current state of the schools that are identified, what is the backstop on that from the equity lens?

01:27:41.219 --> 01:27:45.683
We feel it to be very important and we'll comment more on item 22 and item 24 tomorrow.

01:27:45.963 --> 01:27:46.364
So thank you.

01:27:51.445 --> 01:27:55.908
President Kerr, Superintendent Thurmond, members of the board, I'm Dean Drescher here on behalf of EdVoice.

01:27:56.389 --> 01:28:12.581
I'd like to echo board member Ortiz-Lycone's earlier comments and say, again, similar in our letter with the Equity Coalition earlier, this week we think it's the right move for LEAs to list the schools identified for CSI and in their LCAP.

01:28:13.402 --> 01:28:18.606
We also think that we would recommend schools that are identified for TSI and ATSI also be

01:28:19.346 --> 01:28:21.327
identified in that for transparency.

01:28:22.068 --> 01:28:24.730
We'd also recommend that that be included on the dashboard as well.

01:28:25.730 --> 01:28:44.943
We'd add that we recommend that the criteria for county offices reviewing CPSAs to include school level needs assessments, evidence-based interventions, and clear identification of resource inequities, as well as how the LEA is going to evaluate the effectiveness of the CPSAs in order to improve outcomes for kids.

01:28:45.263 --> 01:28:45.503
Thank you.

01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:55.643
President Kirst, I'm Brian Rivas speaking on behalf of the Education Trust West.

01:28:55.663 --> 01:28:58.006
Sorry about my voice, getting over something.

01:28:58.966 --> 01:29:10.937
We agree with our colleagues in the Equity Coalition with regard to the need for additional transparency around notice to parents and members of the community when a school is identified in these categories.

01:29:11.538 --> 01:29:17.063
And we would ask that you think about this issue from the point of view of a parent who has a student in one of these schools.

01:29:17.703 --> 01:29:24.690
they're probably going to want to know what it means, what's being done to address the problems, and what are the opportunities to participate.

01:29:25.431 --> 01:29:38.243
So to that end, I agree with my colleague from Edvoice that we'd like to see the additional categories of schools identified, the additional targeted support, and so on, identified in an LCAP.

01:29:39.304 --> 01:29:52.678
And with regard to the review, I understand what you're going for with regard to aligning the review of the plans, but we're a little concerned that the plan for school improvement will get lost in the larger LCAP.

01:29:52.958 --> 01:29:58.244
We'd like to see some specific criteria direction to county offices in reviewing those plans.

01:30:04.646 --> 01:30:06.729
Good morning, members of the State Board.

01:30:06.749 --> 01:30:10.213
John Affeldt from Public Advocates and on behalf of the Equity Coalition.

01:30:10.233 --> 01:30:15.539
I appreciate the work that's been done trying to align these plans.

01:30:16.323 --> 01:30:17.685
I think it's going in the right direction.

01:30:17.725 --> 01:30:28.637
I think the our biggest concern is we're not sure you're complying with the federal requirement for the state board to approve the plans.

01:30:30.058 --> 01:30:36.786
But you're approving a summary of what LEA is going to do to help plans, but you're not actually approving the plans.

01:30:37.438 --> 01:30:48.323
I think the way, we think the way to get at that is through the County Office of Education who's getting money to help each CSI school plan.

01:30:48.363 --> 01:30:56.766
Well, they ought to be looking at those plans and they ought to be able to do more than just say, you know, hold their nose if they think it's a bad plan.

01:30:57.206 --> 01:30:59.867
They ought to be able to say, we don't approve this plan.

01:31:00.568 --> 01:31:04.709
You need to align it better with your LCAP and available resources.

01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:05.190
So I think,

01:31:06.450 --> 01:31:14.985
Dealing with the guidance is the way to kind of get the counties to play a more active role in actually approving the individual plans.

01:31:15.025 --> 01:31:15.225
Thanks.

01:31:22.731 --> 01:31:25.872
Good morning, LeAngela Reed on behalf of the Small School Districts Association.

01:31:26.472 --> 01:31:27.393
I'm the counterpoint.

01:31:29.133 --> 01:31:34.235
There are more people spoke on this item than we have in some of my small school districts running them.

01:31:35.236 --> 01:31:45.679
And to that point, I think that the focused approach that you are taking where it keeps the responsibility on the districts, I understand the interest in kind of the links and so forth.

01:31:46.059 --> 01:31:47.160
I worry about it diluting.

01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:48.361
the resources.

01:31:48.481 --> 01:31:52.244
I like the idea of working with folks on the guidance and what information needs to be in there.

01:31:52.625 --> 01:31:59.551
Because I think that if we start getting into we're going to list this and that, then there's an assumption that it's taking care of an issue rather than actual dealing with it.

01:31:59.991 --> 01:32:05.736
And frankly, with a small number of staff that many of our districts have and, you know, county offices,

01:32:06.757 --> 01:32:09.381
did get some more money, but they also have a lot more responsibilities.

01:32:09.881 --> 01:32:18.051
I think it's important that we focus on improving those services for students and making sure their needs are being met first and then we can worry about what's coming to the state.

01:32:18.491 --> 01:32:18.832
Thank you.

01:32:18.852 --> 01:32:22.075
Okay, that concludes public comment.

01:32:22.115 --> 01:32:23.277
Board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

01:32:25.126 --> 01:32:44.654
I have a question regarding our legal obligation under ESSA because it was brought up in terms of as the SEA We are obligated to approve the CSI plans, but this would be going through the county offices and then a list of recommended Plans would come to us without us necessarily looking at each plan.

01:32:45.174 --> 01:32:50.036
So can you can you advise on that how that adheres to ESSA and

01:32:50.638 --> 01:32:54.822
Uh, maybe the or if you're looking at me like that, I'm not sure.

01:32:54.862 --> 01:32:56.943
Mr. Becherres is the expert on that.

01:32:57.003 --> 01:32:58.004
You're now into ESSA.

01:33:04.650 --> 01:33:07.432
Yeah, we have an item on this tomorrow, too.

01:33:08.713 --> 01:33:10.375
It was brought up in public comment.

01:33:10.535 --> 01:33:11.996
I understand why you're asking.

01:33:12.623 --> 01:33:15.087
David Sepp, Assistant Legal Counsel at the State Board of Education.

01:33:15.147 --> 01:33:17.991
So yes, this has been through joint legal review.

01:33:18.011 --> 01:33:27.766
The department's legal division as well as board legal staff reviewed this and the requirements of ESSA specify certain things that must be addressed in the plans.

01:33:28.426 --> 01:33:36.291
And so the process that's being proposed with these prompts as well as the required template for the school plan that the department is putting out.

01:33:36.311 --> 01:33:48.839
So if schools are identified, the LEA must use that plan or have a pre-approved version of the plan that CD has reviewed to ensure address all of those requirements that those together jointly address the requirements of SAA.

01:33:52.281 --> 01:33:53.262
Any further discussion?

01:33:55.558 --> 01:34:11.147
I want to clarify the motion that I'm recommending the Department of Education's recommendation with the understanding that to the extent you can make changes with the term evaluation rubric to be consistent with the California dashboard, that that occur as well.

01:34:11.687 --> 01:34:11.967
Okay.

01:34:12.928 --> 01:34:13.548
Second to that?

01:34:14.849 --> 01:34:15.129
Second.

01:34:15.689 --> 01:34:16.050
All right.

01:34:16.290 --> 01:34:18.291
All those in favor, raise your hands.

01:34:18.631 --> 01:34:19.071
Thank you.

01:34:19.091 --> 01:34:19.772
Okay.

01:34:19.792 --> 01:34:22.353
Do we want to take a break now?

01:34:22.433 --> 01:34:24.474
Yeah, we'll take a break and we'll resume at 10.15.

01:34:32.534 --> 01:34:38.895
Item four, there has been a change in the status of item four.

01:34:39.636 --> 01:34:41.436
One, two, three, four, five.

01:34:41.516 --> 01:34:42.156
I have a quorum.

01:34:43.016 --> 01:34:46.317
Yes, please come forward for the presentation.

01:34:46.417 --> 01:34:50.058
Larry Shirey, please come forward and make the presentation.

01:34:52.338 --> 01:34:56.239
We're ready for the CDE presentation by Larry Shirey.

01:34:56.439 --> 01:34:57.479
Please come forward.

01:34:58.940 --> 01:34:59.880
We're on item four.

01:35:04.411 --> 01:35:04.851
Is this on?

01:35:06.252 --> 01:35:06.652
Go ahead.

01:35:07.332 --> 01:35:07.712
You can hear?

01:35:07.732 --> 01:35:09.993
Okay.

01:35:10.033 --> 01:35:16.155
Good morning, President Kirst, Superintendent Thurmond, members of the board.

01:35:16.235 --> 01:35:18.476
I'm Larry Shirey, School Fiscal Services Division.

01:35:19.656 --> 01:35:22.917
And let me get... We need microphone.

01:35:22.977 --> 01:35:24.218
Somebody check that.

01:35:24.538 --> 01:35:29.019
How about now?

01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:30.600
Yeah, go ahead.

01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:32.060
Is this one on?

01:35:32.841 --> 01:35:33.501
Yeah.

01:35:33.761 --> 01:35:33.961
Okay.

01:35:34.793 --> 01:35:35.873
Pull them together, yeah.

01:35:38.094 --> 01:35:40.695
Let me get the presentation up.

01:35:53.179 --> 01:35:55.140
Except we're not at the right place here.

01:35:57.742 --> 01:36:12.235
Okay, this morning we have three separate territory transfer appeals all from the same area of Santa Clara County, all from the Campbell Union High School District and its component elementary districts into adjacent districts to the west.

01:36:13.055 --> 01:36:22.063
This is the latest in a series of territory transfer issues that the county has been dealing with in this area for the last 25 years.

01:36:24.112 --> 01:36:27.734
Because of that, I'm going to spend a few moments going over that history.

01:36:28.755 --> 01:36:39.682
And I'm only going to do it once, even though it applies to all three items, just to, so you know that what I say in the next couple of minutes applies to all three appeals.

01:36:42.044 --> 01:36:48.949
Usually, as you know, at this point, I give you a summary of options and procedures, but I'm going to skip over that.

01:36:50.037 --> 01:36:53.461
This time for reasons that will become obvious, I hope, in a few minutes.

01:36:54.562 --> 01:36:58.386
And just jump right into the historical review.

01:36:59.447 --> 01:37:06.334
In the mid-1990s, the Santa Clara County saw a significant increase in territory transfer requests.

01:37:08.217 --> 01:37:23.609
from the Campbell High School District and its component elementary districts into the Los Gatos Saratoga Joint Union High School District and Los Gatos and Saratoga Elementary Districts and to a lesser degree, the Cupertino Elementary District and the Fremont High School District.

01:37:26.111 --> 01:37:27.312
There are a number of reasons for that.

01:37:28.473 --> 01:37:30.835
There used to be, excuse me,

01:37:32.512 --> 01:37:38.875
Inter-district attendance agreements used to be readily obtained from parents who lived in the area.

01:37:39.035 --> 01:37:48.800
And as you'll see in a map in a few moments, a lot of the issue is because the school district boundary splits the city of Saratoga and the town of Los Gatos.

01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:55.343
So there are a great number of people who live in those communities that don't go to the Saratoga and the Los Gatos school districts.

01:37:56.643 --> 01:38:04.287
And those requests are no longer being approved like they used to be for a number of reasons.

01:38:04.867 --> 01:38:06.568
One is enrollment started increasing.

01:38:06.688 --> 01:38:10.890
At the same time, class size reduction policies were being implemented.

01:38:11.190 --> 01:38:15.412
So it was putting a lot of stress on district's ability to house students.

01:38:17.113 --> 01:38:22.015
The assessed valuation of property in the area is very high.

01:38:23.004 --> 01:38:31.107
And so a number of the districts were basic aid, excess tax district, community funded districts, whatever, however you want to refer to them.

01:38:31.627 --> 01:38:36.108
So they did not receive additional revenue for any additional students.

01:38:37.649 --> 01:38:44.871
And so it was a cost to the districts to bring in students from outside the districts and didn't generate any funding.

01:38:46.687 --> 01:39:01.038
Also, the growth of technology in Silicon Valley brought a lot of people from the Midwest and the West, or from the East and the Midwest, who weren't familiar with the concept of school district boundaries and city boundaries not matching.

01:39:01.859 --> 01:39:10.506
So they move here, they move into the city of Saratoga, and to put it mildly, they're disappointed when they find they're not in the Saratoga school district.

01:39:11.624 --> 01:39:28.668
And those people, as I mentioned, who live within the town of Los Gatos and the city of Saratoga, who didn't go to those school districts, felt that they were somewhat disenfranchised from full membership in Los Gatos and Saratoga life.

01:39:31.689 --> 01:39:35.410
I just want to give you a brief overview of the issues.

01:39:35.870 --> 01:39:40.571
This is the city of Saratoga in kind of a light green outlined in heavy black.

01:39:41.471 --> 01:39:49.114
And the orange framed green line is the school district, the high school attendance boundary, or high school district boundary.

01:39:49.694 --> 01:39:57.297
As you can see, the city of Saratoga is in a number of surrounding districts.

01:39:57.337 --> 01:40:01.059
About 40 percent of the city is in districts outside of Saratoga.

01:40:01.159 --> 01:40:03.660
Can you just re-describe that where you started again?

01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:04.660
You said the orange?

01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:05.780
There's a green

01:40:09.697 --> 01:40:11.138
These are Census Bureau maps.

01:40:12.219 --> 01:40:19.784
And the way they identify school district boundaries is for a high school district and an elementary school district boundary line.

01:40:20.425 --> 01:40:21.646
Elementary districts are green.

01:40:21.886 --> 01:40:23.607
High school district boundary lines are orange.

01:40:23.647 --> 01:40:30.052
So when you have a boundary line between a high school district, between high school districts, it's going to be orange framed green line.

01:40:30.892 --> 01:40:32.774
So that's the school district boundary lines.

01:40:33.914 --> 01:40:38.958
Campbell High School District is on the east side of that line.

01:40:40.069 --> 01:40:45.153
Los Gatos Saratoga Joint Union High School District is in the southwest corner.

01:40:45.713 --> 01:40:49.996
The Fremont Union High School District and Cupertino Elementary School District is to the north.

01:40:51.277 --> 01:40:57.482
The dark black line is the city boundary of Saratoga, and it's kind of shaded a faint green.

01:40:59.815 --> 01:41:03.339
Yeah, these districts are all made up when these were farming areas.

01:41:03.959 --> 01:41:09.865
So the city of San Jose has 20 districts in its boundary, two of which have one school.

01:41:10.526 --> 01:41:14.910
So they were aggregated from farming areas and farming localities.

01:41:14.970 --> 01:41:16.372
That's where it goes back to.

01:41:16.552 --> 01:41:20.276
So there was no historical thought or anything about this.

01:41:21.149 --> 01:41:31.534
And that's a big reason why people out in the east and the Midwest don't experience that because the growth here in California is much more recent than you have back there.

01:41:31.814 --> 01:41:36.436
And we have the concept of township school districts in that area for the most part.

01:41:37.837 --> 01:41:39.238
This is the town of Los Gatos.

01:41:40.098 --> 01:41:40.758
Same issues.

01:41:42.719 --> 01:41:50.363
Again, the boundary line is the orange shaded green, the kind of yellow shaded area.

01:41:50.859 --> 01:41:54.761
outlined in black is the town of Los Gatos.

01:41:56.222 --> 01:42:14.792
Now one thing to take into account is that although the Campbell school districts are far from low performing school districts, it's really hard to compete with the academic performance of Cupertino and Los Gatos and the Saratoga school districts.

01:42:15.032 --> 01:42:16.773
So those districts are very desirable.

01:42:17.173 --> 01:42:18.213
for people to move into.

01:42:19.473 --> 01:42:26.375
There are a lot of, and that's another reason why we see a lot of territory transfer requests into those districts.

01:42:27.395 --> 01:42:46.018
That, since they are desirable district, it also brings concerns to the affected school districts that, you know, one of the reasons that residents are seeking these transfers is to increase property values because housing prices are higher in the more desirable school districts.

01:42:48.024 --> 01:42:56.648
Early on, when we first, when the county first saw its first transfer, Campbell High School District and its components were really the only ones that opposed it.

01:42:58.048 --> 01:43:14.755
They warned early on that if you, and we're talking about small piecemeal type transfers, they warned early on that if you approve one, you're just setting up more territory transfers behind that, a cascading effect as the Campbell School District

01:43:21.095 --> 01:43:21.475
mentioned.

01:43:22.115 --> 01:43:27.257
Sorry, I don't know if you saw that comment.

01:43:27.417 --> 01:43:28.418
But there was some support.

01:43:30.298 --> 01:43:33.719
The Los Gatos and the Saratoga school districts, for the most part, were neutral.

01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:42.382
The Saratoga City Council, for example, adopted a resolution wanting all of its city territory in the Saratoga school district.

01:43:43.963 --> 01:43:47.824
The first request that the county committee heard, they approved.

01:43:50.441 --> 01:43:54.144
And then they saw a lot more after that.

01:43:54.544 --> 01:43:59.829
At one point in time, they were dealing with 17 separate neighborhoods in a single time period.

01:44:00.989 --> 01:44:04.512
So they started disapproving the transfers.

01:44:04.813 --> 01:44:07.755
And then the appeals started to the State Board of Education.

01:44:08.175 --> 01:44:11.538
The first appeal the state board heard, they overturned the county committee.

01:44:12.648 --> 01:44:21.594
So there was a lot of impetus in the area that this was going to be a successful operation.

01:44:22.655 --> 01:44:38.686
And the Santa Clara County decided that they needed to, at this point, with all the interest of being generated for territory transfers and district reorganizations, conduct an area-wide study of all the districts in this area, which is what they then undertook.

01:44:40.526 --> 01:44:49.528
That study took a year and looked at unification options as well as other reorganization options in addition to the territory transfer issues that they were addressing.

01:44:50.669 --> 01:44:57.591
Since it took so long and they had a number of territory transfer issues lined up behind them, they have timelines in which they have to take action.

01:44:58.091 --> 01:45:02.212
They came to the state board and asked for a waiver of timelines which the state board granted.

01:45:04.853 --> 01:45:09.994
The findings of the reorganization study were that this whole issue of piecemeal transfers

01:45:11.139 --> 01:45:20.704
A small area transfers, boundary moves, opens up the new neighborhoods to transfer the same reason.

01:45:21.604 --> 01:45:24.426
That doesn't address any of the issues in the area.

01:45:24.466 --> 01:45:33.670
It simply moves the boundary line and shifts issues to new neighborhoods that can request territory transfers for the same reason.

01:45:34.531 --> 01:45:36.652
They also found that if you carry that out,

01:45:37.378 --> 01:45:48.105
And the thought here was that the ultimate goal would be to get all of Saratoga, city of Saratoga into the Saratoga school district, all the town of Los Gatos into the Los Gatos school districts.

01:45:48.565 --> 01:45:51.567
That's going to have negative effects in pretty much every district in the area.

01:45:52.868 --> 01:45:57.671
You're transferring higher assessed valuation territory out of the Campbell districts.

01:45:58.471 --> 01:46:01.354
that would shrink the tax base of those districts.

01:46:02.315 --> 01:46:15.127
And because that assessed valuation transfers into the bonding capacities, it likely would deplete their capital accounts for future construction modernization issues.

01:46:15.928 --> 01:46:20.012
But it also is going to have effects on the Los Gatos and Saratoga school districts.

01:46:20.669 --> 01:46:25.211
If you transfer a lot of students into those districts, you're not transferring an equal number of seats.

01:46:25.751 --> 01:46:42.818
So you're overcrowding the schools and potentially negatively affecting the educational programs as well as likely increasing property taxes of the residents of Los Gatos and Saratoga to pay for additional schools that would need to be built to house the students.

01:46:45.859 --> 01:46:51.282
Early support for transfers then kind of disappeared, especially in the Los Gatos and the Saratoga area.

01:46:52.163 --> 01:46:54.424
Not just with the school districts, but with residents.

01:46:54.624 --> 01:47:08.953
During this whole process, the county held a number of public hearings on their study, and the most vocal opponents to come forward were the residents of the Los Gatos and Saratoga school districts.

01:47:09.594 --> 01:47:13.276
You know, their complaints were, you know, we paid to get in this district,

01:47:14.431 --> 01:47:22.816
Bringing other people in is going to cause negative effects on our students, on our schools, and the people coming in are then going to see their property values increase.

01:47:22.856 --> 01:47:24.417
And it became a very emotional issue.

01:47:24.537 --> 01:47:27.139
Hundreds of people would show up at the public hearings.

01:47:27.479 --> 01:47:31.781
The county itself received well over 2,800 written pieces of information.

01:47:31.801 --> 01:47:33.623
Over 2,500 of those were in opposition.

01:47:38.194 --> 01:47:48.381
In response to the study, the county committee adopted an extreme geographic hardship condition as a standard for approving territory transfer requests in this area.

01:47:50.522 --> 01:47:55.946
And that primarily dealt with safety of commute and distance from homes to schools.

01:47:57.062 --> 01:48:07.090
The local newspaper editorials, San Jose Mercury News and the weeklies and Saratoga and Los Gatos included, supported the study, supported the county committee's actions.

01:48:07.411 --> 01:48:22.003
But they did warn that the county committee needs to make sure it defines or explains what it means by extreme geographic hardship because they'll be hearing, they would be hearing that phrase quite frequently in the future.

01:48:24.550 --> 01:48:25.171
which was true.

01:48:25.911 --> 01:48:37.475
You know, since the study was ended, these three today are the 9th, 10th, and 11th appeals that the state board has heard from this area.

01:48:37.535 --> 01:48:42.157
And that's not the total number of territory transfer requests that the county actually dealt with.

01:48:45.498 --> 01:48:47.499
So let's move on to the first appeal.

01:48:48.433 --> 01:48:51.875
where we label this the Alta Vista Territory Transfer Appeal.

01:48:52.495 --> 01:49:04.761
It's a transfer out of the Union School District and the Campbell High School District into the Los Gatos School District and the Los Gatos-Saratoga Joint Union High School District.

01:49:08.563 --> 01:49:16.046
The State Board considered this issue of an identical transfer request in an appeal it heard in 1999, same territory.

01:49:18.809 --> 01:49:26.692
denied by the County Committee, came to the State Board of Appeal and the State Board upheld the County Committee's decision on a unanimous vote.

01:49:28.933 --> 01:49:31.294
Now, here's why I didn't give you your options up front.

01:49:32.054 --> 01:49:38.677
The petitioners in this appeal have just yesterday asked to withdraw their appeal.

01:49:40.717 --> 01:49:44.839
They want to focus on, and the purpose is to focus on reorganization issues.

01:49:45.399 --> 01:49:51.864
at the local level, go back to the county committee and work with them, kind of in light of our study and our recommendations.

01:49:52.985 --> 01:49:58.209
So what that means for you is that even though it's withdrawn, you still have to take action on this.

01:49:59.190 --> 01:50:05.996
But you have an option and one of your options in statute is to summarily deny the appeal without review.

01:50:06.656 --> 01:50:07.837
And that's our recommendation.

01:50:08.998 --> 01:50:14.723
What that means is that I will not present any more information unless, of course, you want more information.

01:50:15.402 --> 01:50:19.624
There will be no public hearing, but there will still, I assume, be public comment.

01:50:20.704 --> 01:50:35.610
I will also add that your staff has been in contact with the petitioners and they understand that their request to withdraw the petition means that we will make a recommendation that the appeal be denied.

01:50:36.330 --> 01:50:41.672
So that's our recommendation right now to summarily deny review of this appeal.

01:50:42.665 --> 01:50:44.691
or summarily deny the appeal without review.

01:50:44.892 --> 01:50:47.019
If you have any questions, I'd be happy to respond.

01:50:48.097 --> 01:50:51.058
Board Member Holliday is our liaison for this area.

01:50:51.638 --> 01:50:56.580
This is a sudden and different change, you know, than what many of you expected.

01:50:56.640 --> 01:51:04.463
But I spoke not only with CDE staff, but CDE council and Larry in the last couple of days going through this.

01:51:06.584 --> 01:51:16.928
I do think we want to honor this request by the petitioners to return to the local level and try to work this out with their county committee or the districts.

01:51:17.783 --> 01:51:26.469
And the way to do that is to use a summary denial of this appeal.

01:51:26.589 --> 01:51:39.137
So I would move the CDE's modified recommendation to summarily deny the proposed territory transfer at the request of the chief petitioners to allow them to pursue this at the local level.

01:51:39.157 --> 01:51:40.258
Is there a second?

01:51:42.605 --> 01:51:45.266
Okay, is there any further discussion?

01:51:45.286 --> 01:51:47.627
But we will have public comment first, of course.

01:51:48.947 --> 01:51:50.528
A clarification question then.

01:51:50.548 --> 01:52:00.291
So I understand this is 59 parcels and it's one of three hearings we're going to have, but my understanding is there's only a small number of students involved that are school age, like maybe three.

01:52:00.312 --> 01:52:00.592
Right.

01:52:00.712 --> 01:52:09.715
In this particular case, there are only, I believe, eight students, four at the elementary school district level and four at the high school district for this appeal.

01:52:11.874 --> 01:52:13.735
Okay, public comment.

01:52:14.415 --> 01:52:18.076
We have two speakers, David Villegas and Robert Brow.

01:52:27.938 --> 01:52:28.299
Good morning.

01:52:29.039 --> 01:52:30.299
My name is David Villegas.

01:52:30.779 --> 01:52:35.461
I am representing Dr. Mary Ann Dewan, Santa Clara County Superintendent of Schools.

01:52:36.001 --> 01:52:40.102
Superintendent Dewan and the County Office of Education supports this summary denial without appeal.

01:52:40.362 --> 01:52:40.602
Thank you.

01:52:46.940 --> 01:52:48.661
Okay, are there any other public comments?

01:52:48.781 --> 01:52:49.641
Please come forward.

01:52:56.123 --> 01:52:59.845
Good morning, I'm Robert Bravo, the superintendent of Campbell Union High School District.

01:52:59.885 --> 01:53:06.147
I just wanted to share with you that I have reviewed the work of your staff and I totally concur with their findings.

01:53:06.207 --> 01:53:10.829
I thought that their report and the one they gave just now are very thoughtful and comprehensive.

01:53:10.849 --> 01:53:14.750
Okay, that concludes the public comment.

01:53:14.810 --> 01:53:16.111
Any further board discussion?

01:53:17.239 --> 01:53:19.981
If not, we'll vote on the motion.

01:53:20.981 --> 01:53:21.682
There's a second.

01:53:21.762 --> 01:53:22.602
Yeah, we will.

01:53:23.243 --> 01:53:26.845
If not, we'll vote on the motion as given by board member Holiday.

01:53:26.945 --> 01:53:28.126
All in favor, raise your hand.

01:53:29.187 --> 01:53:31.208
OK, now we're on to item five.

01:53:34.770 --> 01:53:36.191
OK, second appeal.

01:53:37.779 --> 01:53:40.963
This time, I'm going to go through your options, summarize the options.

01:53:40.983 --> 01:53:42.124
We'll come back to these later.

01:53:42.144 --> 01:53:43.786
I'll summarize the procedure.

01:53:43.846 --> 01:53:46.449
Again, we'll come back to this later, but I like to do this up front.

01:53:47.130 --> 01:53:55.921
In this case, this is a appeal from a unanimous action of the Santa Clara County Committee on School District Organization.

01:53:56.789 --> 01:54:06.995
to disapprove a transfer from the Campbell Elementary School District and the Campbell High School District to the Saratoga Elementary District and the Los Gatos-Saratoga Joint Union High School District.

01:54:07.915 --> 01:54:16.040
Your options, as always, when you hear these appeals, is to either affirm or reverse the action of the County Committee.

01:54:17.061 --> 01:54:19.182
If you reverse the action of the County Committee,

01:54:20.097 --> 01:54:25.518
you are giving your approval to it, but your approval means that it goes back to a local election.

01:54:26.639 --> 01:54:40.162
And with that, you need to make a recommendation about who's going to vote in the election, whether it's just going to be the people in the territory proposed for transfer or do you want to expand it to all the districts or one district or whatever.

01:54:43.343 --> 01:54:44.664
Your procedure is that

01:54:46.823 --> 01:54:50.465
We have nine minimum threshold standards that need to be considered.

01:54:51.325 --> 01:54:55.707
Those are, will the districts be of adequate size after reorganization?

01:54:56.348 --> 01:55:00.209
Is there a substantial sense of community identity in the reorganized districts?

01:55:00.870 --> 01:55:05.492
Is there an equitable method of dividing property of districts if that's required?

01:55:06.573 --> 01:55:09.274
Does it promote racial or ethnic segregation?

01:55:10.146 --> 01:55:13.167
Is it going to significantly increase cost to the state?

01:55:13.608 --> 01:55:17.169
Does it have negative effects on educational programs of any district?

01:55:18.170 --> 01:55:21.231
Will it significantly increase school housing cost?

01:55:22.131 --> 01:55:25.973
Is it primarily designed to increase the property values of petitioners?

01:55:26.353 --> 01:55:30.115
And will there be negative fiscal effects on any affected district?

01:55:31.696 --> 01:55:33.997
If you find that those threshold conditions are met,

01:55:34.707 --> 01:55:38.910
you then need to determine whether or not there's a reason to approve the transfer.

01:55:39.171 --> 01:55:48.378
In this case, on appeal, you're looking for a compelling reason to overturn, in this case, a unanimous decision of the county committee to disapprove the territory transfer.

01:55:50.980 --> 01:55:54.683
And just kind of a heads up, I'll probably bring this up in a moment.

01:55:54.703 --> 01:56:01.348
I'm only going to discuss the condition, the threshold condition that the county committee found not met.

01:56:02.712 --> 01:56:07.536
Unless you want to hear more information about the other eight, I'm not intending to present on it.

01:56:09.318 --> 01:56:20.507
As we've discussed in the past, and I'm sure you're aware, when you're dealing with these small piecemeal transfers, it is very difficult for them not to meet the minimum threshold standards.

01:56:23.349 --> 01:56:24.670
Again, this is just a reminder.

01:56:25.731 --> 01:56:26.912
Excuse me?

01:56:27.212 --> 01:56:28.853
How many students are involved in this?

01:56:29.354 --> 01:56:29.474
One.

01:56:29.974 --> 01:56:30.935
One public school student.

01:56:32.592 --> 01:56:32.732
One.

01:56:33.814 --> 01:56:34.254
Yeah.

01:56:34.495 --> 01:56:34.735
Yeah.

01:56:34.855 --> 01:56:39.120
When I get to the actual discussion, we'll provide more information.

01:56:39.481 --> 01:56:48.953
Again, this is just a reminder that the information about the historical transfers that the county has dealt with also is the context for the current proposal.

01:56:51.499 --> 01:56:55.161
This one we're calling the Camino Barco transfer proposal.

01:56:55.622 --> 01:57:09.371
It's a proposed transfer of 10 parcels, one public school student from, as I said, the Campbell, the two Campbell school districts to the Saratoga and the Los Gatos Saratoga school district.

01:57:11.252 --> 01:57:13.394
The first one that we dealt with,

01:57:14.278 --> 01:57:18.520
It was the exact, an exact same issue came to the state board in 1999.

01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:25.222
For this one, it's a subset of parcels from one that the board also heard in 1999.

01:57:26.922 --> 01:57:39.107
That again was unanimously, the larger one was again unanimously denied, but at the local level and the action of the county committee again was unanimously affirmed by the state board in 1999.

01:57:42.523 --> 01:57:45.984
The reasons that the petitioners give for the transfer is student safety.

01:57:46.464 --> 01:57:57.506
They believe that the commutes to the Campbell School Districts are much less safe than are the commutes to the Saratoga and the Los Gatos Saratoga School District.

01:57:57.566 --> 01:57:58.866
Also, community identity.

01:57:59.446 --> 01:58:02.127
The transfer area, they're in the city of Saratoga.

01:58:02.507 --> 01:58:09.988
They feel a stronger sense of community with the Saratoga School District as well as the Saratoga community at large.

01:58:12.492 --> 01:58:16.115
This is just a brief overview of the transfer area.

01:58:16.135 --> 01:58:20.498
I'm going to come back to this map when we start talking about student safety and commute issues.

01:58:21.278 --> 01:58:29.504
But just to give you a feel for where we are here, the proposed transfer area is shaded in gray, of course, sort of toward the center.

01:58:30.305 --> 01:58:37.690
On the left hand side is the Saratoga School District and the Los Gatos Saratoga Joint Union High School District.

01:58:38.317 --> 01:58:42.179
with the schools that this area would be assigned to or likely to be assigned to.

01:58:42.319 --> 01:58:47.822
Identified Argonaut Elementary, which is about two miles from the proposed transfer.

01:58:47.842 --> 01:58:51.645
Saratoga High, which also is about two miles from the proposed transfer area.

01:58:52.205 --> 01:58:55.287
And Redwood Middle School, about three quarters of a mile.

01:58:56.287 --> 01:58:58.088
On the other side is Westmont High.

01:58:58.508 --> 01:59:00.750
That's Campbell Elementary and Campbell High School District.

01:59:01.190 --> 01:59:06.353
It's about a mile and a half from the area, as is the Rolling Hills Middle School.

01:59:07.136 --> 01:59:09.817
Marshall Lane Elementary is about a mile from the area.

01:59:11.058 --> 01:59:15.840
The red line over on the right hand side of the screen is the city of Saratoga boundary.

01:59:15.920 --> 01:59:22.564
So you can see there is considerable territory of the city of Saratoga within the Campbell School districts.

01:59:22.964 --> 01:59:25.905
Again, I'm going to come back to that when we go in more detail about safety.

01:59:28.287 --> 01:59:31.688
All four districts are opposed to the transfer.

01:59:33.877 --> 01:59:36.699
All four of them oppose for similar reasons.

01:59:37.419 --> 01:59:42.662
One is they reference the unanimous disapproval of the previous transfer that contained these properties.

01:59:43.482 --> 01:59:46.624
They claim that all the minimum threshold standards are not met.

01:59:46.684 --> 01:59:50.926
So there's no reason, there's no reason even to move forward to looking at a reason to transfer this.

01:59:51.727 --> 01:59:58.970
It's going to set a precedent for future transfers, which is the issue that the study, you know, the county has been dealing with for 20, 25 years.

02:00:00.876 --> 02:00:09.702
And they also note that they believe, in their opinion, since there really isn't any other reason to transfer the territory, that the petitioners just want to increase their property values.

02:00:11.283 --> 02:00:27.154
In addition to those common reasons for opposition, the Campbell districts, since they will be losing higher assessed valuation territory, argue that it'll increase the financial obligations of remaining property owners in terms of repaying general obligation bonds.

02:00:27.975 --> 02:00:29.456
And it will also negatively affect

02:00:29.963 --> 02:00:32.804
district finances and their bonding capacity.

02:00:32.844 --> 02:00:37.405
Again, by taking students and assessed valuation, in other words, bonding capacity out of the district.

02:00:38.225 --> 02:00:47.187
The Los Gatos Saratoga High School district notes that future transfers will contribute to overcrowded facilities and eventually disrupt educational programs.

02:00:47.687 --> 02:00:52.248
Again, as you recall, these are issues that were raised in the study the county did.

02:00:55.148 --> 02:00:57.169
The county committee disapproved the transfer.

02:00:57.429 --> 02:00:58.629
It found that

02:00:59.205 --> 02:01:02.027
One of the minimum threshold conditions was not met.

02:01:02.728 --> 02:01:04.909
That was the community identity condition.

02:01:06.130 --> 02:01:08.391
And here is the statement of that condition.

02:01:08.431 --> 02:01:13.935
The school districts are each organized on the basis of substantial community identity.

02:01:15.396 --> 02:01:25.483
The county committee found that there was no compelling argument that the transfer area is isolated as claimed by the petitioners from the Campbell Elementary and Campbell High School District.

02:01:25.947 --> 02:01:30.833
There's no evidence that commute to Campbell schools is less safe than Saratoga schools.

02:01:31.594 --> 02:01:40.867
And that the community identity arguments that are brought forward by this neighborhood is not unique to other neighborhoods in the proposed transfer area.

02:01:44.614 --> 02:01:56.377
In their findings, we find that the county committee really focused on not existing community identity, but on the fact that the petition or the transfer would not improve community identity.

02:01:57.136 --> 02:01:59.917
So we find that the condition is substantially met.

02:02:00.238 --> 02:02:06.441
We believe there's no burden on the petitioners to prove that the transfer improves community identity.

02:02:06.821 --> 02:02:25.631
We also find that the county committee's own findings that there is no evidence of differences in community safety or unique community identity circumstances support the findings that it doesn't really matter which school district these territories, these properties are in, community identity condition is met.

02:02:28.388 --> 02:02:47.987
Now that we have established that at least it's the department recommendation that all the minimum threshold standards are met, we then move towards reasons that you might want to consider to go ahead and approve the approve the territory transfer or reverse the county committee's action.

02:02:49.888 --> 02:02:50.249
Excuse me.

02:02:51.027 --> 02:02:54.731
And those reasons come from the petitioners themselves.

02:02:54.891 --> 02:03:05.881
And we've already gone through these to a degree, the home and school, home to school commute safety issue, the fact that they feel a stronger sense of community with Saratoga and the Saratoga School District.

02:03:06.462 --> 02:03:15.030
And they also add that their conditions are unique, that no other surrounding communities really, really meet the standards that they have.

02:03:17.093 --> 02:03:20.576
So we'll go back to the map we had earlier and talk about commute safety.

02:03:21.857 --> 02:03:23.318
I've already given you the distances.

02:03:23.838 --> 02:03:29.123
Argonaut and Saratoga are farther away.

02:03:29.143 --> 02:03:35.408
The elementary and the high school district are farther away than Westmont and Marshall Lane in terms of the middle school.

02:03:35.428 --> 02:03:41.072
The Redwood Middle is only three quarters of a mile away versus a mile and a half of Rolling Hills Middle School.

02:03:41.873 --> 02:03:46.717
But the distances aren't what the petitioners are arguing about primarily.

02:03:47.247 --> 02:04:06.793
They argue that Allendale Avenue, which is the road that is just north of the area proposed for transfer, is a very dangerous route to travel to the Campbell schools because there aren't bike paths or sidewalks along the entire length of the road.

02:04:07.873 --> 02:04:12.515
They also argue that the students must use Keto Road, which

02:04:13.666 --> 02:04:19.509
kind of follows the part of the red boundary line, but it is a yellow road on the right hand side that goes north and south.

02:04:20.149 --> 02:04:25.472
And that's a very heavily trafficked road that makes it dangerous to walk and bike to the schools.

02:04:27.433 --> 02:04:34.997
I should note that even though it shows that road crossing Highway 85, there is no access at that point.

02:04:35.517 --> 02:04:37.718
So it just simply goes over the freeway.

02:04:38.078 --> 02:04:41.640
But still, we agree that Quito Road is a pretty heavily traveled road.

02:04:43.562 --> 02:04:51.568
On the other side, the districts in the county argue that the travel that way is equally unsafe.

02:04:52.228 --> 02:05:02.035
Saratoga Avenue, which separates Argonaut and Saratoga High School from the proposed transfer area, is the local access to Highway 85.

02:05:02.656 --> 02:05:05.958
And it's a very busy, congested street during commute hours.

02:05:07.006 --> 02:05:14.932
Also, if they're heading west to the Saratoga schools, they have to pass by the West Valley Community College campus.

02:05:15.813 --> 02:05:28.023
And there are multiple entrances to the parking lots to that campus along Allendale Avenue and also Fruitvale Avenue, which is a north-south route in front of Redwood Middle School.

02:05:29.082 --> 02:05:39.024
So for those reasons, the county found that commutes aren't ideal in either direction, but there's no significant difference in commute safety here.

02:05:39.625 --> 02:05:40.485
And we agree with that.

02:05:43.385 --> 02:05:45.966
Now, let me go back one more moment.

02:05:46.006 --> 02:05:51.587
There's also been a lot of study of commute safety issues in this area.

02:05:52.628 --> 02:05:58.449
As I mentioned, the county committee and the state board dealt with a previous issue that also talked about

02:05:59.076 --> 02:06:04.257
commute safety, but also there have been a number of other territory transfer petitions around here.

02:06:05.998 --> 02:06:06.998
Two across the street.

02:06:08.018 --> 02:06:15.720
The previous transfer proposal, which is right next to the Camino Barco, not on the map or a couple just south of that previous transfer proposal.

02:06:16.320 --> 02:06:20.761
And again, going back to the piecemeal transfer argument, if those were to transfer,

02:06:22.165 --> 02:06:34.668
and change the boundaries, then you have multiple communities to the east and to the northeast that could also come back with territory transfers requested for the same reasons that petitioners do.

02:06:35.208 --> 02:06:49.251
So we don't find that the Comito Barco neighborhood has any specifically unique conditions, that there are many neighborhoods in the surrounding area that also would have those issues.

02:06:51.792 --> 02:07:03.339
Turning, so those were the reasons we just talked about the reasons that the petitioner state bring forward to give you to consider if you want to overturn the county committee's decision.

02:07:03.860 --> 02:07:10.444
We also believe that there are reasons to let the county committee's unanimous decision stand.

02:07:11.164 --> 02:07:11.885
One is that

02:07:12.853 --> 02:07:15.775
we believe that there will be some encouragement of future transfers.

02:07:15.815 --> 02:07:16.896
It's been shown in the past.

02:07:17.476 --> 02:07:23.500
The area-wide study identified that and all four districts identified that as a concern.

02:07:26.221 --> 02:07:40.851
Additionally, if you look at carrying those piecemeal transfers out to the Saratoga city boundary, as a study has talked about, the enrollment growth and future transfers would place pressure on the future ability of the Saratoga and

02:07:41.744 --> 02:07:43.585
districts to house and educate students.

02:07:44.426 --> 02:07:49.489
And as we've discussed previously, it could cause fiscal difficulties to the Campbell school districts.

02:07:50.449 --> 02:08:01.055
And even though we don't find that the proposed transfer is primarily for purposes of increasing property value, it certainly is the district's concern.

02:08:01.435 --> 02:08:04.257
So it's also maybe something that you want to consider.

02:08:05.918 --> 02:08:11.041
In summary, we find that all the minimum threshold standards are substantially met.

02:08:12.731 --> 02:08:17.513
All the minimum threshold standards are substantially met, including the one that the county committee found wasn't.

02:08:18.393 --> 02:08:24.135
We find no reasons compelling enough to overturn the unanimous decision of the county committee.

02:08:25.095 --> 02:08:31.197
We do have some concerns with the territory transferred in terms of precedent setting, especially.

02:08:31.906 --> 02:08:36.210
And we recommend that the State Board affirm the County Committee disapproval of the transfer.

02:08:37.491 --> 02:08:45.758
So, your action again, as we mentioned up front, you may affirm or reverse the County Committee's decision to disapprove the proposed transfer of territory.

02:08:46.458 --> 02:08:51.763
If you vote to overturn the County Committee, you need to establish an election area.

02:08:52.223 --> 02:08:57.928
Again, our recommendation is that the State Board affirm the action of the County Committee.

02:08:59.002 --> 02:09:02.104
I'd be happy to answer questions now or after public hearing.

02:09:03.165 --> 02:09:05.046
Board Member Holliday, do you want to comment now?

02:09:05.586 --> 02:09:08.688
No, I have no, excuse me, I have no comment at this moment.

02:09:09.248 --> 02:09:10.849
Yes, okay, public comment.

02:09:12.450 --> 02:09:12.991
Public hearing.

02:09:13.491 --> 02:09:15.092
Public hearing, okay.

02:09:15.572 --> 02:09:17.533
I now declare the public hearing open.

02:09:18.414 --> 02:09:26.279
Each side has 10 minutes and so we will take the proponents of the territory transfer first.

02:09:26.819 --> 02:09:28.520
Please come forward, you have 10 minutes.

02:09:56.544 --> 02:09:56.991
Yeah, yeah.

02:10:26.134 --> 02:10:27.295
Good morning, board members.

02:10:28.556 --> 02:10:29.897
My name is Lali Yadav.

02:10:30.397 --> 02:10:34.279
My husband, Rishi, and I are one of the chief petitioners.

02:10:34.780 --> 02:10:37.822
We have 11-year-old boy.

02:10:38.302 --> 02:10:39.263
He's in sixth grade.

02:10:39.283 --> 02:10:40.644
He goes to private school.

02:10:41.624 --> 02:10:44.946
And there are five students, not one.

02:10:46.187 --> 02:10:50.230
Three of them will immediately benefit.

02:10:50.670 --> 02:10:55.113
Two in elementary school and one, my son, in middle school.

02:10:58.291 --> 02:10:58.691
Good morning.

02:10:59.111 --> 02:11:00.191
My name is Rishi Yadav.

02:11:00.632 --> 02:11:14.995
In combination, as you have seen the reviews by the Santa Clara County Office of Education and the California Department of Education, they have acknowledged that our petition meets all of the nine necessary criteria, but there are still questions about the issue of our children's safety.

02:11:15.775 --> 02:11:18.156
Accordingly, in this presentation, we are going to

02:11:21.256 --> 02:11:27.022
focus on the safety issues, which is our biggest concern, as well as provide some relevant background information.

02:11:27.722 --> 02:11:29.564
I'm here with six other neighbors.

02:11:29.704 --> 02:11:31.466
They are total 10 petitioners, as you know.

02:11:31.946 --> 02:11:34.909
And three of them, Rich, Simran, and Steve, will be speaking to you.

02:11:46.800 --> 02:11:52.163
Good morning, President Kurtz, Superintendent Thurmond, Board.

02:11:52.683 --> 02:11:56.345
Appreciate the time you take to hear our case.

02:11:57.446 --> 02:11:58.347
I'm Richard Previtt.

02:11:59.507 --> 02:12:03.529
You can tell by my hair that I'm one of the original residents of Camino Barco.

02:12:05.591 --> 02:12:07.592
We moved into our home in 1979 and we still reside there.

02:12:10.799 --> 02:12:15.322
Camino Barco is a small cul-de-sac street.

02:12:15.843 --> 02:12:20.145
It's only about 1,000 feet from Allendale to the end of the cul-de-sac.

02:12:20.726 --> 02:12:21.326
Very small.

02:12:22.387 --> 02:12:33.274
Prior to the development, access to the street was confined to, there's a line

02:12:34.154 --> 02:12:54.939
on the, to the left here, of the four homes you see on the bottom, was confined to a narrow single lane, basically roughly improved street, that connected to this home from 1925, which was the home of Colonel Barco, for whom the whole area was named, and he's the namesake of the street.

02:12:57.181 --> 02:13:08.572
And in the early 1970s, a development was approved by the city for 13 homes to be put into this tract.

02:13:09.713 --> 02:13:12.896
The first four homes were completed between 1974 and 1976.

02:13:16.059 --> 02:13:23.530
Access to Colonel Barkow's home, as well as these four homes, was through this very narrow easement, if you will.

02:13:23.590 --> 02:13:29.479
That easement actually is territory that belongs to the Mormon church next door.

02:13:31.301 --> 02:13:41.687
As the development continued, the city determined that the houses there needed access for safety fire utilities.

02:13:42.347 --> 02:13:47.550
And so in the 1977-78, the city engineer provided the requirements for the development of and moving the street

02:13:56.355 --> 02:14:04.801
The old street was called Camino de los Barcos, and the new development was to be renamed Camino Barco, shortening the name.

02:14:05.221 --> 02:14:14.707
But that street was moved over to the right on these slides, and the next home after the first four that went in was in 1977 on the corner of Allendale.

02:14:17.356 --> 02:14:26.004
That called for the development of the street to the city specifications, 40 feet wide, and accommodating all the utilities and access.

02:14:26.644 --> 02:14:35.132
At that time, also, the city engineer called for the abandonment of the access that was the easement.

02:14:35.932 --> 02:14:38.375
And that was called Camino de las Marcos.

02:14:38.795 --> 02:14:40.576
And if you look at the first

02:14:41.937 --> 02:14:46.700
engineering drawings for our home, because we were one of the first ones down in that end.

02:14:47.921 --> 02:14:51.043
The address on the drawings was Camino de los Barcos.

02:14:51.644 --> 02:15:01.510
But once the city filed and dedicated the new street, Camino Barco, the street then effectively was moved over and followed out to Allendale.

02:15:01.530 --> 02:15:06.593
And then subsequently, the remainder of the homes were developed in that area.

02:15:07.273 --> 02:15:09.535
However, the first four homes

02:15:10.854 --> 02:15:21.784
access by this easement are in the Saratoga School District on the same street as the additional nine homes that were subsequently built over the next few years.

02:15:22.865 --> 02:15:25.608
So what happened either by omission or error

02:15:27.148 --> 02:15:35.459
The school boundary for the Saratoga School District was not moved over along with the parcels that are on the same street.

02:15:36.060 --> 02:15:42.269
So we have a bifurcated street with four homes in one district, ten homes in another.

02:15:43.923 --> 02:16:04.010
I think that this is an opportunity for the board to come to correct this literally this error or an omission and for the future generations of the next generation that's coming into the neighborhood that they provide that all of those 14 homes should be in the same school district.

02:16:04.591 --> 02:16:05.571
Thank you for your time.

02:16:08.827 --> 02:16:09.148
Thank you.

02:16:10.349 --> 02:16:13.571
My name is Saman Sabrawal and I'm one of the chief petitioners.

02:16:14.592 --> 02:16:18.776
And despite my hair color, I am also one of the original occupants of Camino Barco.

02:16:21.298 --> 02:16:23.980
I've lived there for 40 years since I have been one year old.

02:16:25.482 --> 02:16:35.310
I personally attended Saratoga schools growing up, but currently have one child enrolled in CUSD with another child about to be enrolled in the coming years.

02:16:37.052 --> 02:16:39.674
So what does it take to get a transfer request approved?

02:16:40.675 --> 02:16:46.360
The CDE report agrees that we've met all the criteria necessary for a transfer approval.

02:16:47.181 --> 02:16:57.991
However, an outdated, over 20-year-old study recommends blanket denials of all transfer requests regardless of merit, unless exceptional circumstances exist.

02:16:59.852 --> 02:17:02.695
The study also included guidelines describing these circumstances.

02:17:04.110 --> 02:17:14.217
The guidelines state that all other commute criteria being equal, if one commute places students in greater danger, that fits the exceptional circumstance requirement.

02:17:16.359 --> 02:17:21.582
The guidelines dictate that the commute between the closest schools in each district be compared.

02:17:22.883 --> 02:17:27.306
For our purposes, that is a comparison between Redwood Middle School and Marshall Lane Elementary.

02:17:28.447 --> 02:17:29.288
I now want to show you

02:17:30.669 --> 02:17:39.935
the commute I took as a child to Saratoga schools versus the commute I currently take my son on to Campbell schools, though the same commute concerns are valid for the high school districts as well.

02:17:41.716 --> 02:17:51.982
There are sidewalks along the entire route from our neighborhood to Redwood, passing the two entrances to West Valley College, mischaracterized as multiple entrances in the report.

02:17:52.963 --> 02:17:55.845
There are crosswalks with pronounced signage for pedestrian safety.

02:17:57.102 --> 02:18:02.253
At Fruitvale Avenue, there are highly visible crosswalks with two crossing guards to ensure student safety.

02:18:03.155 --> 02:18:05.860
Now let's contrast that with the walk to Campbell schools.

02:18:07.944 --> 02:18:12.186
the most dangerous part of our route is right when you leave our neighborhood onto Allendale Avenue.

02:18:13.206 --> 02:18:18.889
No other parcels of land in the CUSD have to deal with this stretch of road.

02:18:19.729 --> 02:18:21.390
It is highly unique to our situation.

02:18:22.290 --> 02:18:27.792
There are no sidewalks, no bike paths, and no curbs to walk on during this stretch of road.

02:18:28.532 --> 02:18:30.613
Shrubbery forces students to walk in the street.

02:18:31.314 --> 02:18:34.735
This part of our route scares me and my family every time we walk it.

02:18:37.259 --> 02:18:44.185
Right after that dangerous stretch, there is this speed sign, in this case indicating a car going 43 in a 25 zone.

02:18:45.346 --> 02:18:56.356
During the dangerous stretch of road I just showed you, which is located right before this sign, cars are often going even faster, until this sign causes them to slam on their brakes when they realize just how fast they're going.

02:18:58.442 --> 02:19:02.025
Further down the road, there's this speed limit sign installed just a few months ago.

02:19:02.906 --> 02:19:07.169
You can see it has already been completely destroyed from the reckless driving occurring on this stretch of road.

02:19:09.091 --> 02:19:15.016
Here we also see that the Saratoga crosswalks on the right are much more visible than the ones to Campbell Schools on the left.

02:19:15.797 --> 02:19:19.560
Additionally, there are no crossing guards on Quito Road in the CUSD.

02:19:21.877 --> 02:19:31.500
Returning to the county committee studies own guidelines, they state that assessing commute safety must include assessing the availability of sidewalks and shoulders for students.

02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:43.363
The CDE report claims that other nearby neighborhoods, namely Sarah Oaks Court, Via Alto Court, and Harley Drive have safe commutes and that those commutes are identical to ours.

02:19:44.404 --> 02:19:49.305
We agree that their commutes are relatively safe, but their commute is not our commute.

02:19:50.777 --> 02:20:02.200
Sarah Oaks Court has a sidewalk all the way to Via Alto Court, which has a sidewalk all the way to Harley Drive, which has a marked bike lane all the way to Quito Road.

02:20:03.120 --> 02:20:19.305
As a reminder, our commute involves a stretch with no sidewalk, no bike lane, not even a curb to walk on, but overgrown shrubbery that forces students and families to walk in the road.

02:20:20.894 --> 02:20:26.206
Our commute is not identical to the other neighborhoods mentioned and is highly unique to our neighborhood.

02:20:27.949 --> 02:20:30.435
So when considering the county committee's own guidelines.

02:20:31.818 --> 02:20:33.239
We do have a unique situation.

02:20:33.979 --> 02:20:36.361
Sidewalks and shoulders are not available for students.

02:20:37.201 --> 02:20:40.443
The disparity does place our students in significantly greater danger.

02:20:41.544 --> 02:20:48.248
Therefore, we do meet the county committee's criteria of exceptional circumstances, which means the county committee's decision should be reversed.

02:20:49.089 --> 02:20:55.612
And the uniqueness of our situation, as a reminder, no other parcels in Campbell's districts deal with the stretch of Allendale.

02:20:55.973 --> 02:20:56.193
None.

02:20:57.313 --> 02:21:01.056
Argues against the slippery slope and piecemeal concerns outlined in the CDE report.

02:21:01.536 --> 02:21:01.856
Thank you.

02:21:03.618 --> 02:21:09.343
Okay, now the opponents to the transfer of territory will have 10 minutes.

02:21:15.588 --> 02:21:16.069
Okay.

02:21:17.590 --> 02:21:18.311
No opponents.

02:21:18.711 --> 02:21:20.773
Do you want to speak at this point or no?

02:21:20.893 --> 02:21:21.474
Coming forward.

02:21:21.514 --> 02:21:21.814
Thank you.

02:21:31.892 --> 02:21:32.412
Good morning.

02:21:33.193 --> 02:21:36.594
I'm Shelly Veramontes, the superintendent for Campbell Union School District.

02:21:37.295 --> 02:21:44.318
And I... I'm going to let someone else take that down.

02:21:47.734 --> 02:21:52.675
Anyway, starting over, I'm Shelly Vermontes, the superintendent for Campbell Union School District.

02:21:53.076 --> 02:22:08.400
And one of the points I wanted to remind you of is I believe you saw in your data that while the proponents made issue with the fact that this is an unsafe commute, when you compared the number of traffic incidences

02:22:08.960 --> 02:22:12.702
in Saratoga School District to our school district.

02:22:13.202 --> 02:22:17.144
There were more accidents in Saratoga, so I dispute that argument.

02:22:17.604 --> 02:22:20.985
I'm here representing the resources for our school district.

02:22:21.426 --> 02:22:24.447
We are currently experiencing declining enrollment.

02:22:24.947 --> 02:22:29.090
And we've shared the fact that we don't believe this is a one-off.

02:22:29.610 --> 02:22:32.832
We are comprised of students from six municipalities.

02:22:32.952 --> 02:22:40.396
And so if we start looking at city and municipality district borders as the way we're going to define districts,

02:22:41.437 --> 02:22:44.359
that will basically annihilate our resources.

02:22:44.820 --> 02:22:47.542
So last year we cut $1.8 million.

02:22:48.102 --> 02:22:55.908
This year for the 19-20 budget we're planning for an additional $2 million budget reduction in part because of declining enrollment.

02:22:56.368 --> 02:23:00.532
And so we're really trying to regard our resources for our students.

02:23:01.212 --> 02:23:03.774
And we believe that we serve them quite well.

02:23:04.174 --> 02:23:07.137
We don't believe that there is a compelling reason

02:23:07.757 --> 02:23:13.039
to overturn the county's decision except for the real estate value.

02:23:13.559 --> 02:23:22.642
And I would also add that every time a boundary line is created, there is always someone on each side of the boundary line.

02:23:23.222 --> 02:23:30.665
So each time you could argue that the boundary line should be moved because now we're on the other side of the boundary line.

02:23:30.745 --> 02:23:34.846
So that's all I would say for Campbell School District.

02:23:37.822 --> 02:23:43.546
My son goes to one of Superintendent Victor Montes' schools, so I agree, they're a good district.

02:23:45.128 --> 02:23:54.214
I just want to reiterate for you this idea that we've heard a theme about city boundaries matching district boundaries.

02:23:55.115 --> 02:24:06.063
And that is so far the case from Santa Clara County to think that we could do this piecemeal would be just a gigantic Herculean effort.

02:24:06.683 --> 02:24:12.945
The name of our district is Campbell Union High School District, but the majority of our students actually have San Jose addresses.

02:24:13.885 --> 02:24:15.865
We have five comprehensive high schools.

02:24:16.425 --> 02:24:18.386
Four of them have San Jose addresses.

02:24:18.586 --> 02:24:23.427
So the name Campbell does not imply a one-to-one with Campbell.

02:24:23.887 --> 02:24:26.748
And so I just hope that you keep that in mind, that

02:24:29.818 --> 02:24:36.223
Although it sounds great to have the one-to-one correspondence with cities, we are far from that right now.

02:24:36.243 --> 02:24:44.989
Okay, I now declare the public hearing closed and we'll take further public comment.

02:24:47.136 --> 02:24:49.097
Would the following people please line up?

02:24:49.838 --> 02:25:07.189
David Villegas, Robert Bravo, Shelly Viramontes, Simran Sabrahal, Rishi Yavdav, Leila Yavdav, Richard Pravit, Steve Schwarzkopf, and Billy Cheng.

02:25:07.209 --> 02:25:13.873
Go ahead.

02:25:14.653 --> 02:25:15.294
Good morning again.

02:25:16.296 --> 02:25:17.278
My name is David Villegas.

02:25:17.399 --> 02:25:21.447
I am representing Dr. Mary Ann Dewan, Santa Clara County Superintendent of Schools.

02:25:22.318 --> 02:25:31.742
Superintendent DeJuan and the county office supports the county office analysis, the CDE staff recommendation, and the county committee's unanimous denial of this reorganization request.

02:25:32.242 --> 02:25:44.588
The Santa Clara County Committee has heard reorganization issues affecting school districts in this area since the mid-1990s and in 1997 conducted an area-wide study that found that piecemeal boundary changes such as this one

02:25:45.348 --> 02:25:51.373
shift community identity problems and safety issues rather than solve them and would have a significant negative impact on the affected districts.

02:25:52.053 --> 02:25:55.716
We stand behind the findings of that study and believe that these concerns are still relevant today.

02:25:56.416 --> 02:26:02.121
I would like to emphasize that each of the affected districts have provided a resolution in opposition to this transfer request.

02:26:02.781 --> 02:26:14.430
Though unable to be present today, Saratoga Union Superintendent Nancy Johnson and Los Gatos Saratoga Joint Union High School District Superintendent Michael Grove have supplied letters in opposition to this transfer request

02:26:14.930 --> 02:26:23.002
In their letters, Superintendents Johnson and Grove cite a redistricting proposal that appears to be motivated primarily by a desire of residents to enhance property value.

02:26:23.382 --> 02:26:25.986
A copy of these letters, in addition to my statement, have been provided.

02:26:26.207 --> 02:26:26.447
Thank you.

02:26:31.459 --> 02:26:31.779
Good morning.

02:26:31.899 --> 02:26:33.040
My name is Steve Schwartzkopf.

02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:34.161
I'm also one of the petitioners.

02:26:34.581 --> 02:26:35.462
I have a couple of comments.

02:26:35.662 --> 02:26:46.210
One, if you take a look at the preface of the California Department of Education's school district organization handbook, it says most people see school district as stable or even permanent government entities.

02:26:46.571 --> 02:26:48.272
School district boundaries, however, do change.

02:26:49.052 --> 02:26:49.573
They change.

02:26:50.213 --> 02:26:54.897
The document, the authors of that document expected there was going to be some kind of flexibility required.

02:26:55.706 --> 02:27:00.568
What the school districts are doing, I understand from a bureaucratic point of view, but flexibility is necessary.

02:27:00.668 --> 02:27:06.170
We've already shown you in detail how unsafe our commute is with these kids.

02:27:07.171 --> 02:27:10.952
My grandkids may have to take this school route.

02:27:11.232 --> 02:27:12.113
I don't want them to do that.

02:27:12.373 --> 02:27:15.914
I've been out there when cars have gone by 60 miles an hour down that street.

02:27:16.354 --> 02:27:17.195
It is scary.

02:27:18.197 --> 02:27:23.859
Also, the nonsense that these guys are saying about no safety thing because they looked at automobile accidents.

02:27:24.319 --> 02:27:37.324
If you look up the number of fatal pedestrian-involved accidents between Campbell and Saratoga in the five years leading up to our petition, seven people were killed in Campbell, one in Saratoga.

02:27:37.964 --> 02:27:40.545
The data is important, but it needs to be the right data.

02:27:45.876 --> 02:27:46.316
Good morning.

02:27:46.376 --> 02:27:47.497
My name is Billy Chen.

02:27:47.957 --> 02:27:49.858
I'm one of the petitioners in this group.

02:27:50.599 --> 02:27:54.101
My house is right next to the Camino Barco and Allendale.

02:27:54.922 --> 02:27:55.862
We moved in 1994.

02:27:56.783 --> 02:28:01.766
At that time when we moved in, they told us their kids is in Saratoga, so we can't attend.

02:28:02.306 --> 02:28:09.710
But my daughter born in 1995, when she reached the age of elementary school, we are told we are not able to attend school.

02:28:10.271 --> 02:28:12.012
So I sent her to private school.

02:28:13.192 --> 02:28:19.435
It's very disheartening seeing all these members telling us, there's nine rules there.

02:28:19.736 --> 02:28:22.437
Even you meet all the rules, we don't want piecemeal.

02:28:22.457 --> 02:28:24.058
We still want to disqualify you.

02:28:24.638 --> 02:28:26.219
I thought we came to the US.

02:28:26.379 --> 02:28:27.799
There's a rule to follow.

02:28:28.220 --> 02:28:31.381
Until rule being changed, you're supposed to follow the rule.

02:28:31.741 --> 02:28:35.023
You shouldn't just totally deny every petition.

02:28:35.463 --> 02:28:37.364
Everyone has a unique situation.

02:28:37.384 --> 02:28:40.785
I went at that time.

02:28:42.607 --> 02:28:48.913
2000, I don't have the courage to stand up to fight for this type of a giant organization like the school board.

02:28:49.373 --> 02:28:52.016
I so admire my current neighbors.

02:28:52.116 --> 02:28:53.357
They're willing to stand up.

02:28:53.777 --> 02:28:54.638
So I joined them.

02:28:54.958 --> 02:28:56.840
Hopefully you will make the right decision.

02:28:57.060 --> 02:29:00.944
Even we only have 10 members, 10 families, very small.

02:29:01.304 --> 02:29:04.127
It's just like David versus Goliath.

02:29:04.488 --> 02:29:06.529
But we hopefully you will agree with us.

02:29:06.710 --> 02:29:06.970
Thank you.

02:29:09.445 --> 02:29:11.287
Okay, that concludes the public comment.

02:29:11.387 --> 02:29:14.790
Now I think it's time for the liaison.

02:29:18.933 --> 02:29:22.036
I get all the fun ones, don't I?

02:29:22.717 --> 02:29:32.185
I do want to thank Larry and his team again for their thorough analysis of each and every one of these issues.

02:29:37.082 --> 02:29:50.189
Liaison calls have gotten shorter more recently because I'm finally coming up to speed on a lot of the history and all of this but There there's always so many angles to each and every one of these things.

02:29:50.209 --> 02:29:51.629
There's always so many concerns.

02:29:51.649 --> 02:29:53.490
There's lots of pieces to consider.

02:29:53.510 --> 02:29:57.732
I do honestly believe that

02:30:01.047 --> 02:30:15.132
that some action needs to be taken by some county organization of some kind to reconsider boundary lines in these areas.

02:30:16.393 --> 02:30:16.773
It is

02:30:17.922 --> 02:30:33.286
an ongoing problem, even though there have been very few territory transfers approved, there's obviously still a great deal of energy and concern and question about these areas.

02:30:34.207 --> 02:30:36.847
I don't think we're the body to solve that problem, though.

02:30:37.067 --> 02:30:39.368
I do not think we're the ones who can

02:30:40.200 --> 02:30:47.553
over and over and over again look at these four houses and those ten houses and these six houses and on and on.

02:30:48.494 --> 02:30:50.598
I am concerned about child safety.

02:30:50.658 --> 02:30:51.720
There's no doubt about it.

02:30:54.220 --> 02:31:01.944
Many, many commutes that children make in many areas throughout the Bay Area are very dangerous.

02:31:02.104 --> 02:31:12.429
I used to run a school in West Oakland, and I was petrified about several locations nearby that my students had to navigate through.

02:31:12.449 --> 02:31:18.892
I would hope that the city of Saratoga would cut their bushes back on that side and paint

02:31:20.713 --> 02:31:27.519
crosswalks and provide those services needed to make this route that these kids are taking safer for them.

02:31:28.960 --> 02:31:49.777
But once again there is a bigger problem here and it's not being solved in the manner that of these individual appeals and as frustrating and painful as it is for these residents I would move the CDE recommendation.

02:31:51.544 --> 02:31:57.905
Board Member Williams, do you want to comment?

02:31:59.526 --> 02:32:13.269
I used to live in that area, not in Saratoga, but my children grew up in Cupertino schools, and my best friend lives in Saratoga, and so Saratoga, Los Gatos, I'm familiar with Allen Road, I'm familiar with Keto Road.

02:32:17.063 --> 02:32:38.274
The fact that there are a very small group of families involved in a small group of houses and the fact that there was things that happened in terms of decisions made that caused the street then to be broken up between some of them going to one school and some of them going to another school, I'm really uncomfortable with that.

02:32:39.034 --> 02:32:41.376
And the safety issues, I think, are real.

02:32:41.476 --> 02:32:45.119
And I think the petitioner made a really compelling case about the safety issues.

02:32:45.399 --> 02:32:46.700
I know what that street looks like.

02:32:47.281 --> 02:32:48.302
And it does look like that.

02:32:48.622 --> 02:32:54.547
And frankly, I myself have driven too fast down that street back in the day when I lived there before I moved to San Diego.

02:32:56.104 --> 02:32:59.685
And so I think they're making a really good case.

02:33:00.305 --> 02:33:07.507
And I would not support, I think there's also one other point I'd want to make is that there's an appeals process up to the state.

02:33:08.127 --> 02:33:10.707
And it's for us to utilize that.

02:33:10.888 --> 02:33:21.010
If they've come up here to appeal to the state, then we have the option to make the decision every single time, just like we do with charter schools, taking into account individual factors and what our,

02:33:21.810 --> 02:33:34.385
What the law says and and what our options are and what our heart says and so I would say that I if it that I will My vote will be cast in favor of the petitioners Board members

02:33:42.359 --> 02:33:47.781
So I just also wanted to thank the petitioners for making a very compelling argument.

02:33:48.281 --> 02:33:50.902
You definitely put a lot of time into and thought into this.

02:33:51.542 --> 02:34:02.526
And as I've also expressed sometimes when we here do the charter public hearings that I think sides tend to mischaracterize intentions of the other side.

02:34:02.546 --> 02:34:09.028
I don't think that the intent of the petitioners is around making sure that their houses are

02:34:09.708 --> 02:34:13.190
Yeah, I do think there's a number of different factors.

02:34:14.150 --> 02:34:18.912
And I'm not unsympathetic to the David and Goliath metaphor as well.

02:34:20.653 --> 02:34:34.719
At the same time, so the responsibility of this board is, while sympathetic to this group of individuals and their houses, we have to look at the larger picture.

02:34:35.600 --> 02:34:42.889
And I agree with board member Holiday's comments that this is an issue that needs to be resolved.

02:34:43.550 --> 02:34:46.694
We are not necessarily the body to be doing that work.

02:34:49.139 --> 02:34:50.000
Board member Strauss.

02:34:50.320 --> 02:34:56.104
So I just want to follow up again on the comments of my colleagues and address the safety issue.

02:34:56.845 --> 02:34:59.087
Those pictures actually were very compelling.

02:34:59.287 --> 02:35:02.850
I wouldn't let my kids or my little grandkids walk down that street ever.

02:35:03.930 --> 02:35:13.938
And so my question is, as we deal with safety going to and from school, my question I guess is, and I guess I'll ask you, Larry, but then we can ask the district.

02:35:14.318 --> 02:35:25.228
Has the district communities done anything to address the bushes or the lack of sidewalks or the area that there's no space for those kids to walk and they have to go in?

02:35:25.248 --> 02:35:27.970
Has there been any action in the investigation?

02:35:28.010 --> 02:35:33.375
Did we look at what the district's responsibility or follow-up has done?

02:35:33.415 --> 02:35:34.997
The districts don't have responsibility.

02:35:35.017 --> 02:35:39.221
They certainly could work with the city of Saratoga to work on those issues.

02:35:40.041 --> 02:35:43.422
You know, I'd like to add a little additional information to that.

02:35:44.123 --> 02:35:47.284
You know, the petitioners, I mean, certainly it's not an ideal commute.

02:35:48.444 --> 02:35:50.965
You look at the travel down Allendale Avenue.

02:35:53.166 --> 02:35:58.468
There is a portion about a block or so that forces kids into the street.

02:35:59.449 --> 02:36:02.050
But I'll also add two caveats to that.

02:36:02.490 --> 02:36:07.252
One is that in traveling to Marshall Lane School, there's an optional walking route.

02:36:08.470 --> 02:36:10.271
South Downchester Avenue around.

02:36:10.412 --> 02:36:11.412
It's a little longer.

02:36:12.093 --> 02:36:13.294
It doesn't go past this.

02:36:13.634 --> 02:36:23.842
But even though it's a little longer commute, it's still shorter than the walk along residential streets to the Saratoga Elementary School, which is two miles away.

02:36:24.422 --> 02:36:30.227
I'll also add that the city of Saratoga takes great pride in its small town environment.

02:36:30.607 --> 02:36:35.431
What that means is there are very few streets in Saratoga that have sidewalks.

02:36:36.311 --> 02:36:39.597
There are very few and not many streets that have streetlights for that matter.

02:36:40.299 --> 02:36:47.894
So when the petitioners characterized their two-mile walk to the Saratoga Elementary School as a long, quiet residential street,

02:36:49.175 --> 02:36:51.756
For the most part, they're not along sidewalks, they're in the streets.

02:36:52.357 --> 02:37:00.861
And those quiet residential streets during school drop-off and school pick-up time are not as quiet as they would be otherwise.

02:37:01.301 --> 02:37:08.545
And that's kind of some additional information to why the county committee and why the department has come to the finding that

02:37:09.793 --> 02:37:12.335
These commutes are not ideal, either direction.

02:37:12.895 --> 02:37:22.861
But there's really no significant compelling difference between the commutes to overturn the local study and the local decisions on this issue.

02:37:23.101 --> 02:37:24.342
That's the department position.

02:37:24.402 --> 02:37:32.627
I want to add, staying on this point, I also live in Santa Clara County and we're talking about elementary school.

02:37:32.647 --> 02:37:34.568
There's also a high school involved here.

02:37:34.628 --> 02:37:35.609
There's other schools.

02:37:36.718 --> 02:37:39.100
I have driven down Saratoga Avenue.

02:37:39.200 --> 02:37:41.441
That's a really heavy commute area.

02:37:43.402 --> 02:37:52.388
And in fact, just to get on it, coming up 280, it backs up a couple of miles on the freeway sometimes to get on that road.

02:37:52.468 --> 02:38:03.055
So I think if you want to get into the details of these traffic routes, you've got to look at the high school, it seems to me.

02:38:03.095 --> 02:38:04.796
You've got to have a really good grasp

02:38:05.998 --> 02:38:11.123
rather than a few streets because you're talking about commuting to three different schools.

02:38:12.124 --> 02:38:16.468
And, you know, Saratoga Avenue is really heavy.

02:38:18.670 --> 02:38:25.056
And so to me, I'd have to have a ton more information on these traffic routes all the way.

02:38:25.834 --> 02:38:30.476
to call this one on, I know the traffic routes and the safety.

02:38:30.556 --> 02:38:33.877
So if the board wants to get into that, they can get into that.

02:38:34.017 --> 02:38:39.219
But that then gets, I think we go to board members' holidays point.

02:38:39.459 --> 02:38:42.360
At some point, this is beyond where we can go.

02:38:42.841 --> 02:38:43.341
Who's next?

02:38:43.461 --> 02:38:43.821
I'm sorry.

02:38:45.061 --> 02:38:46.422
Board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

02:38:47.267 --> 02:38:51.850
Thank you, and I could definitely sympathize with the parents who spoke.

02:38:53.571 --> 02:38:59.675
I do think, though, that we could potentially get ourselves into a messy situation where we have to tease so many things out.

02:39:00.095 --> 02:39:04.438
You know, I'm sorry, sir, we don't acknowledge people in the, so we're all going to give our comment.

02:39:04.458 --> 02:39:07.620
The public comment is still, and we will not recognize you.

02:39:07.640 --> 02:39:08.060
Go ahead.

02:39:09.842 --> 02:39:10.582
Okay, thank you.

02:39:11.683 --> 02:39:21.231
So what I wanted to say is I think that this is the end product of disjointed systems, city and district, but that is just the reality.

02:39:21.291 --> 02:39:32.681
You know, I could sympathize because I worked for a year and a half with both Long Beach Unified and the City of Long Beach to put a stop sign right adjacent to the street where my kids were attending school.

02:39:33.201 --> 02:39:36.922
It's messy, it's a lot of work, but it's really the city's responsibility.

02:39:37.402 --> 02:39:40.822
The district sends somebody out to look at a transportation planner.

02:39:41.623 --> 02:39:46.443
So many of the issues that I saw, there was like, well, that's district, that's city, that's district, that's city.

02:39:46.763 --> 02:39:50.624
And we can't sit here and tease out every single situation that will come before us.

02:39:51.064 --> 02:40:01.386
Because if you go to any community in Oakland, in Long Beach, in some of the most neglected communities that we have, you will see worse pathways than what we're seeing now.

02:40:02.146 --> 02:40:06.268
And for us, we really need to be aware, what are we opening ourselves to?

02:40:06.448 --> 02:40:10.069
Because this is something that we could say, well, the city could address that.

02:40:10.289 --> 02:40:15.311
Should we redraw district boundaries in order to address something that maybe falls on the city?

02:40:15.751 --> 02:40:29.536
And I don't know that any of us have necessarily the background or wanna open that to make this body something that is now also overseeing facilities and city issues that should be addressed by the city and by the district in partnership.

02:40:29.816 --> 02:40:30.076
Thank you.

02:40:32.655 --> 02:40:41.346
First of all, I want to thank all of the people who came today to participate in the hearing and this particular conversation.

02:40:41.826 --> 02:40:44.850
I am sympathetic to what the parents were concerned about.

02:40:45.351 --> 02:40:51.979
I taught school in a district that went through the growing pains of for a long time being

02:40:52.579 --> 02:41:00.003
a low-income area with very serious issues about housing and community development.

02:41:00.043 --> 02:41:20.093
And as developers looked, started looking at that area and building houses and putting in sidewalks and adjusting the commutes and enrollments for schools, my local superintendent was involved in talking with the developers and trying to sort out the community, the county and the city issues that were involved with doing all of that work.

02:41:20.673 --> 02:41:28.718
But at the same time, there were clear local concerns and local issues that have to be addressed.

02:41:29.278 --> 02:41:33.300
In this venue and today, Board Member Holliday is correct.

02:41:33.341 --> 02:41:41.105
There are responsibilities or obligations this board has in doing this review process and in considering the appeal.

02:41:41.685 --> 02:41:45.708
And they are not incompatible with the concerns that were being presented today.

02:41:46.468 --> 02:41:47.809
But at the same time,

02:41:48.464 --> 02:41:56.042
the clear conflict between what is a local responsibility concerning safety, concerning planning the travel routes.

02:41:57.216 --> 02:42:07.087
concerning clearly marking the crosswalks won't be resolved by overturning the decision that was made by the county.

02:42:07.507 --> 02:42:15.616
Those issues will still remain for the students who still need to use those routes for commuting, and those issues still need to be addressed.

02:42:16.157 --> 02:42:18.480
So they will not be resolved

02:42:18.940 --> 02:42:21.361
by the decision the board is making today.

02:42:21.801 --> 02:42:32.765
But the board is addressing its statutory obligation in doing this review and hearing this appeal and considering what the county looked at in the criteria under the statute.

02:42:32.805 --> 02:42:39.047
So I agree with the recommendation and I agree with the recommendation from the department staff for that for those reasons.

02:42:42.128 --> 02:42:43.008
Board member Karnas.

02:42:44.407 --> 02:42:46.948
I really empathize with the community that came today.

02:42:47.008 --> 02:42:53.792
You know, as board member Ortiz Lincoln had mentioned, it's like Oakland has a very similar issue that we are going through.

02:42:53.832 --> 02:43:00.855
I mean, we've had someone riding a bike get killed right in front of my school, so I really empathize with traffic issues and people being endangered.

02:43:01.375 --> 02:43:05.637
But regardless of the outcomes today, you are not the only one who is going through that.

02:43:05.717 --> 02:43:06.837
I'm sure in your community.

02:43:06.857 --> 02:43:17.442
So I really encourage you to go to your city and talk to the people representing you in your community to be like, hey, this is an issue that we are facing that we don't want to have our little kids worried.

02:43:17.522 --> 02:43:23.385
We don't want to worry about our little kids getting hurt because of the issues they are facing, you know, with traffic.

02:43:23.425 --> 02:43:28.727
And so I really encourage you to go to the city regardless, because I'm sure, like I said, you're not the only one going through it.

02:43:29.227 --> 02:43:31.410
And so, yeah, that's all I have to say.

02:43:36.184 --> 02:43:38.885
This is not a unique problem that many communities have faced.

02:43:38.945 --> 02:43:44.947
And again, I think the people who came from the community to talk about the concerns as well as the staff who put together this report.

02:43:47.047 --> 02:43:54.629
I think that part of the challenge in this is that we definitely have empathy, but this isn't the body, I think, to solve this bigger problem.

02:43:54.689 --> 02:44:00.571
And it's a it's a confusion from realtors selling homes and people coming in and not understanding the city and the district differences.

02:44:01.651 --> 02:44:07.534
Perhaps and maybe a small solution and is that the receiving district honor the inter-district transfers.

02:44:07.554 --> 02:44:15.098
These are only 10 kids and it's not every school and it's not going to create the fiscal problem of having to build new schools.

02:44:15.419 --> 02:44:18.460
That might be a single solution for the short term.

02:44:18.480 --> 02:44:20.741
And again, it's up to the receiving district to allow that.

02:44:20.801 --> 02:44:29.366
But for now, I think that we have to look at the criteria and look at the criteria based on sound decisions, which you have presented today.

02:44:29.386 --> 02:44:29.806
So thank you.

02:44:33.116 --> 02:44:34.196
Okay.

02:44:34.376 --> 02:44:36.338
There's a motion on the floor without a second.

02:44:36.438 --> 02:44:36.718
Yes.

02:44:36.858 --> 02:44:37.439
We know that.

02:44:37.499 --> 02:44:37.739
Yeah.

02:44:37.759 --> 02:44:40.221
We're ready for a second for the motion.

02:44:41.422 --> 02:44:41.702
All right.

02:44:41.742 --> 02:44:42.823
Board member Sandoval.

02:44:43.564 --> 02:44:43.864
Oh, you.

02:44:43.964 --> 02:44:44.284
Okay.

02:44:44.324 --> 02:44:45.125
We have a second.

02:44:45.165 --> 02:44:45.565
Thank you.

02:44:46.446 --> 02:44:46.746
All right.

02:44:47.306 --> 02:44:49.128
I think we've expressed our views.

02:44:49.828 --> 02:44:50.028
No.

02:44:53.071 --> 02:44:53.291
Yeah.

02:44:53.651 --> 02:44:54.052
Okay.

02:44:55.052 --> 02:44:59.436
So the department's recommendation is to reject the petition.

02:44:59.576 --> 02:45:01.077
All those in favor, raise your hands.

02:45:02.481 --> 02:45:02.982
Opposed?

02:45:03.982 --> 02:45:12.010
Okay, so it passes with a majority of the board to make the action that the petition is denied.

02:45:20.180 --> 02:45:34.056
Okay, we will now then do the Senate Youth Program and then substitute that because the students have some time constraints and the superintendent also wants to make a comment on the prior item.

02:45:35.297 --> 02:45:44.500
I thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, members of the board, for the opportunity to speak, and also for your thorough discussion of the matter at hand.

02:45:45.300 --> 02:45:47.181
I want to thank the petitioners.

02:45:48.041 --> 02:45:52.262
And, you know, this is the kind of item where, unfortunately, nobody wins today.

02:45:52.902 --> 02:45:56.063
The concerns raised about safety were serious.

02:45:56.123 --> 02:46:00.765
The concerns raised from districts about balancing enrollment needs are serious.

02:46:02.146 --> 02:46:09.653
I don't want it to be that because the decision is what it is, that we ignore that there are still actions that can be taken.

02:46:10.234 --> 02:46:18.301
Just as there was a suggestion that through intra-district enrollment and transfers, the immediate needs can be accommodated, there are other things that can be done.

02:46:19.082 --> 02:46:25.504
And I will be directing the staff at the California Department of Education to follow up with some of the local communities to do the following.

02:46:26.124 --> 02:46:31.646
One, to make contact with the local districts and the local municipalities involved to address the issues.

02:46:31.986 --> 02:46:37.547
Some of them are as simple as cutting back the bushes that are intruding into the street.

02:46:38.128 --> 02:46:46.090
To have conversations about where crosswalks can be painted to be more clearly designated for safe pedestrian travel and for monitoring traffic.

02:46:46.650 --> 02:46:58.499
I experience this every day when my kids go to school, and I have seen that when cars are speeding by and a police officer parks their vehicle at that intersection, within a few days, behavior changes.

02:46:59.260 --> 02:47:03.443
I'm not asking the Department of Education to do the work of local districts, but we will not ignore

02:47:04.204 --> 02:47:13.006
a need, we will use our ability to facilitate to ask those who have to do the work to do the work of monitoring the speeds and the traffic.

02:47:13.406 --> 02:47:20.148
And finally, to reach out to the County Office of Education to ask them to double down on their efforts around planning for districts.

02:47:20.568 --> 02:47:25.529
We heard from several superintendents today who said they are struggling around changes in enrollment.

02:47:25.809 --> 02:47:26.870
decline in enrollment.

02:47:27.210 --> 02:47:32.512
We have to find a way to balance the needs of our districts with the needs of our families to ensure that they have safety.

02:47:32.973 --> 02:47:42.718
And it is my expectation that those county office representatives would provide a report back to the State Board of Education because this board will continue to get these types of appeals.

02:47:43.138 --> 02:47:47.040
It is important that we send a message that we expect that planning to take place

02:47:47.620 --> 02:47:49.763
and to report back to the State Board of Education.

02:47:50.204 --> 02:47:57.033
And so I want to thank my staff in advance for making these efforts to the local districts.

02:47:57.093 --> 02:48:02.440
And of course, I'm available to assist you as needed in our efforts.

02:48:03.519 --> 02:48:06.420
to have these matters resolved at the local community level.

02:48:07.421 --> 02:48:08.081
Thank you, Mr. President.

02:48:08.101 --> 02:48:08.441
Thank you.

02:48:08.781 --> 02:48:18.966
And if I could just say one thing, and maybe people might be angry at me for saying this, that county committees operate under the direction of the State Board of Education.

02:48:19.506 --> 02:48:27.089
And the State Board of Education can direct the county committee to review reorganization issues in any area of the county.

02:48:27.390 --> 02:48:28.190
So that's something that

02:48:29.771 --> 02:48:36.136
if you really think is an issue, that that directive can come from the State Board.

02:48:41.359 --> 02:48:48.805
All right, and so we're now ready for Dina Fong to present on the Senate Youth.

02:48:59.878 --> 02:48:59.998
Oh.

02:49:00.379 --> 02:49:03.586
They're in the other room because there's no room in this room.

02:49:36.584 --> 02:49:37.104
Good morning.

02:49:39.166 --> 02:49:41.288
Good morning, Superintendent Thurmond, President.

02:49:41.868 --> 02:49:42.789
Good morning, everyone.

02:49:42.809 --> 02:49:45.931
All right.

02:49:46.852 --> 02:49:47.212
How's this?

02:49:48.922 --> 02:49:53.045
Good morning, Superintendent Thurman, President Kirst, and honorable board members.

02:49:53.545 --> 02:49:54.606
I'm Dina Fong, the U.S.

02:49:54.626 --> 02:49:56.387
Senate Youth Coordinator for California.

02:49:57.348 --> 02:50:02.792
Today is a special day where we have the pleasure of recognizing our United States Senate Youth students.

02:50:03.533 --> 02:50:06.535
The United States Senate Youth Program is sponsored by the U.S.

02:50:06.575 --> 02:50:10.498
Senate and funded and administered by the William Randolph Hearst Foundation.

02:50:11.178 --> 02:50:25.940
Now in its 57th year the program provides an opportunity to selected students to gain an in-depth view of the Senate and the federal government as well as provide a foundation for those considering a future in public service on the local, state, or national level.

02:50:26.881 --> 02:50:32.565
High school juniors and seniors are nominated by their principal to apply for this highly competitive merit-based program.

02:50:33.185 --> 02:50:44.273
To qualify, students must currently be serving in an elected or appointed leadership position in student government or a civic or educational organization representing their peers for the entire school year.

02:50:45.353 --> 02:50:56.321
Our students have gone through a rigorous application process and have demonstrated outstanding leadership qualities, academic achievement, school and community involvement, and a commitment to public service.

02:50:57.382 --> 02:51:04.788
The last phase of the program is to formally present to you our 2019 United States Senate Youth Delegates and Alternates.

02:51:05.189 --> 02:51:10.653
These students are among the best of the best in their school community and the state.

02:51:11.494 --> 02:51:16.098
There is no doubt they will succeed in whatever they do and will serve their communities with passion.

02:51:17.219 --> 02:51:32.430
Our two delegates will represent California during an all-expenses paid trip this March in Washington, D.C., where they will see national government in action and hear from senators, cabinet members, and other officials, which should be pretty interesting.

02:51:33.803 --> 02:51:43.094
They will each receive a $10,000 college scholarship for undergraduate studies with encouragement to study coursework and political science or history.

02:51:43.975 --> 02:51:49.781
So now I'd like to take a few minutes to introduce each student so you can hear more about them.

02:51:50.522 --> 02:51:59.550
Our first delegate is Lauren Kong, a senior at Palos Verdes Peninsula High School in the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District.

02:52:00.310 --> 02:52:16.224
A national merit semifinalist scoring 1510 out of 1015, excuse me, 1520 points on the PSAT, she currently serves as the student member of the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District Board of Education.

02:52:17.024 --> 02:52:22.830
And in case she looks familiar to you, she was also a top three finalist for the student member position on the state board.

02:52:26.754 --> 02:52:35.383
She is president of the MOP trial civic justice program, co-founder of the robotics team, and captain of the girls longboard competition surf team.

02:52:36.619 --> 02:52:40.560
She has a wide variety of skills which she uses to help her community.

02:52:40.760 --> 02:52:48.523
She is an after-school tutor for English learners at her local elementary school and a certified welder by the American Welding Society.

02:52:50.043 --> 02:52:57.706
She also volunteers for a non-profit with her welding skills that rehabilitates former gang members and inmates in the Los Angeles area.

02:52:58.982 --> 02:53:04.765
She is deeply committed to public service and plans to double major in political science and mechanical engineering.

02:53:05.686 --> 02:53:14.391
And she wants to combine her two passions to draft effective legislation to use technology to revolutionize society and improve it for the better.

02:53:14.871 --> 02:53:15.352
Lauren Kong.

02:53:20.879 --> 02:53:21.179
Okay.

02:53:21.900 --> 02:53:26.925
Our second delegate is Cindy Aguilar Castaneda, a senior at Gonzales High School in Gonzales.

02:53:26.965 --> 02:53:27.646
And this is Cindy.

02:53:28.927 --> 02:53:43.000
She serves as one of two youth commissioners with the Gonzales Youth Council, the official youth advisory group to the Gonzales City Council and the Gonzales Unified School District, which makes integral policy decisions on the board.

02:53:43.741 --> 02:53:58.633
She is a founder and mentor of Mentoring in New Dimensions Mind, a peer mentoring club that focuses on first generation college students and is an instructional aid to elementary school students and volunteers as a softball coach for young girls.

02:53:59.574 --> 02:54:08.641
As one of 12 students selected nationally for the Bezos Family Foundation Scholars Program, she is working on a local ideas festival

02:54:09.602 --> 02:54:10.723
to improve her community.

02:54:11.304 --> 02:54:20.135
Called Senior Swarm, it is a day to focus on college and career readiness, which helps Gonzales seniors apply for college and network with community members.

02:54:21.596 --> 02:54:26.361
She would like to major in political science and public policy, ultimately obtaining a PhD.

02:54:27.202 --> 02:54:42.596
As a first-generation college student and the first to graduate high school in her family, Cindy's passion is to work directly with politicians and mobilize underrepresented communities, such as minorities, immigrants, first-generation college students, and individuals with disabilities.

02:54:45.159 --> 02:54:46.260
So congratulations to Cindy.

02:54:51.488 --> 02:54:57.534
Now, if Lauren or Cindy should be unable to participate in Washington Week, then one of our alternates will take their place.

02:54:58.535 --> 02:55:06.984
Our first alternate is Channing Lee, a senior at Cornelia Connelly School in Anaheim, where she currently serves as associate student body president.

02:55:10.828 --> 02:55:22.142
She is editor-in-chief of her school newspaper, lead defense attorney and mock trial, plays volleyball, and acted with the Advanced Women's Ensemble where she sings, acts, and performs on stage.

02:55:23.556 --> 02:55:28.960
An American Prodigy Piano Competition winner, she has performed at Carnegie Hall twice.

02:55:29.921 --> 02:55:38.428
She volunteers as a debate coach for middle school students to prepare them for local tournaments, as well as organizes a free two-week summer debate camp.

02:55:39.308 --> 02:55:44.933
In addition, she is a debate judge trainer and has helped develop an online judge training program.

02:55:46.113 --> 02:55:52.518
Channing aspires to work in public service and is fascinated by history, especially regarding relationships among nations.

02:55:53.519 --> 02:56:01.947
She would like to major in international relations, followed by a law degree to further equip herself with skills necessary for a career in public service.

02:56:02.647 --> 02:56:11.375
She wants to give back to her community by helping others, whether as a lawyer fighting for justice or as a diplomat striving to improve American interests abroad.

02:56:12.036 --> 02:56:13.437
So congratulations to Channing.

02:56:18.163 --> 02:56:24.765
And then our second alternate is Gabriel Drill, a senior at La Cunada High School in the La Cunada Unified School District.

02:56:24.785 --> 02:56:25.645
And this is Gabriel.

02:56:26.726 --> 02:56:33.148
He was appointed through a competitive selection process to serve as chair of the La Cunada City Youth Council.

02:56:33.768 --> 02:56:43.131
He is active in the YMCA Youth and Government Program where he became delegation president as a freshman and has continued to serve in that position for the past four years.

02:56:44.011 --> 02:56:50.201
At school, he is active with the California Scholarship Federation, National Honor Society, and the varsity wrestling team.

02:56:51.607 --> 02:57:05.609
He has been accepted as a Yale Young Global Scholar in their Politics, Law, and Economics program, Columbia University's Summer Immersion Program in Business, Finance, and Economics, and as an intern at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab.

02:57:06.470 --> 02:57:07.710
So a wide variety of interests.

02:57:08.610 --> 02:57:20.192
He volunteers at the YMCA summer camp, at a residential shelter for women and children, and also assembles care packages for veterans and military individuals stationed overseas.

02:57:21.590 --> 02:57:27.056
He would like to pursue dual degrees in public policy and business, followed by grad school.

02:57:27.676 --> 02:57:42.331
His future goals include starting a nonprofit to research a cure for diabetes, and possibly serving as the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, helping to formulate domestic and international economic policies to better our nation and the world.

02:57:43.826 --> 02:57:48.188
So please join me in congratulating our four outstanding, amazing students.

02:57:48.748 --> 02:57:55.871
This is just a sampling of their many accomplishments at such a young age while maintaining a strong GPA.

02:57:56.091 --> 02:57:57.912
And I don't know how they do it, and they sleep.

02:57:58.512 --> 02:58:01.713
But I know that our future is in good hands with them.

02:58:02.193 --> 02:58:03.914
So congratulations to our students.

02:58:10.597 --> 02:58:11.517
And I'd like to

02:58:16.249 --> 02:58:20.751
I'd like to invite President Kirsten and Superintendent Thurmond to come and take photos with the students.

02:58:46.645 --> 02:58:48.006
Right here.

02:58:48.427 --> 02:58:51.530
Sit down a little bit.

02:58:52.250 --> 02:58:53.852
There we go.

02:59:53.382 --> 02:59:53.762
Mr. President.

02:59:55.083 --> 02:59:55.704
Oh, you can hold it.

02:59:55.724 --> 02:59:56.784
Oh, we'll hold it together.

02:59:56.804 --> 03:00:02.288
We have to have something that you can hold.

03:00:02.328 --> 03:00:03.709
But you can keep it.

03:00:03.969 --> 03:00:04.349
All right.

03:00:04.389 --> 03:00:05.110
Thank you.

03:00:05.290 --> 03:00:05.770
Thank you.

03:00:06.011 --> 03:00:07.271
Congratulations.

03:00:08.913 --> 03:00:15.097
Do we have another one?

03:00:15.117 --> 03:00:17.338
No, but... Seems to be welding.

03:00:32.156 --> 03:00:32.936
Thank you.

03:00:32.977 --> 03:00:33.557
Congratulations.

03:00:33.597 --> 03:00:33.957
Thank you.

03:01:17.639 --> 03:01:20.420
We would stand somewhere.

03:01:20.600 --> 03:01:24.001
Yeah.

03:01:45.963 --> 03:01:50.246
I think we have to go in the front, actually, because I'm not sure.

03:01:50.286 --> 03:01:51.327
Then they won't see them.

03:01:51.387 --> 03:01:55.030
Well, they're all taller than we are.

03:01:55.050 --> 03:01:55.531
What do we do?

03:02:32.997 --> 03:02:40.503
All right, everyone look here and don't blink.

03:02:40.523 --> 03:02:48.029
All right, thanks.

03:02:48.069 --> 03:02:49.210
Congratulations.

03:02:53.553 --> 03:02:55.295
Congratulations.

03:03:13.045 --> 03:03:16.768
Okay, we're going to keep going.

03:03:19.331 --> 03:03:23.335
And Larry, if you'll come back up, we're going to take up item six.

03:03:33.559 --> 03:03:34.180
OK, hello again.

03:03:34.400 --> 03:03:36.682
Larry Shirey, School Fiscal Services Division.

03:03:39.084 --> 03:03:40.024
And let's get going.

03:03:40.044 --> 03:03:45.389
We're going to move on to the third appeal.

03:03:49.540 --> 03:03:53.121
And again, I'm going to quickly go through the same thing I did last time.

03:03:53.141 --> 03:04:07.525
There has been a unanimous denial on the part of the Santa Clara County Committee of a proposed transfer from the Moreland School District and the Campbell High School District to Cupertino Elementary and the Fremont Union High School District.

03:04:07.925 --> 03:04:11.286
Again, you may affirm or reverse the action of the county committee.

03:04:11.306 --> 03:04:14.567
And if you reverse the action, you'll need to set an election area.

03:04:16.678 --> 03:04:19.320
Again, I'm not going to go through the nine conditions unless you want me to.

03:04:19.340 --> 03:04:25.205
The first order of business is to determine that they're all substantially met.

03:04:26.465 --> 03:04:29.988
The county committee has, as you'll see, has found two not met here.

03:04:31.709 --> 03:04:34.091
But I'm not even going to touch the other seven.

03:04:34.892 --> 03:04:42.558
If you determine the conditions are substantially met, then we need to look at a compelling educational reason to overturn the county committee's decision.

03:04:44.104 --> 03:04:54.295
Just again a reminder that the historical transfer issue that I talked about in the first item is again the context for this third appeal.

03:04:58.079 --> 03:05:02.463
Referring to this as the Westbrook transfer proposal, it's a proposed transfer of 123 homes.

03:05:04.400 --> 03:05:09.503
from Moreland to Campbell High School District and Campbell High School District to Cupertino and Fremont.

03:05:10.543 --> 03:05:19.368
Currently, and as of the time we collected information, 20 students attend Moreland School District, six students attend the Campbell High School District.

03:05:21.529 --> 03:05:21.909
Excuse me.

03:05:23.776 --> 03:05:30.400
As you might recall, the first one, the first appeal was the same area that was considered by the state board in 1999.

03:05:30.900 --> 03:05:41.388
The second item had to do with a subgroup of the homes in an appeal approved by, considered by the state board in 1999.

03:05:42.048 --> 03:05:49.233
This one is right across the street from another transfer proposal appeal that the state board heard in 2008.

03:05:49.273 --> 03:05:49.473
And again,

03:05:51.087 --> 03:05:56.194
The state board unanimously affirmed the action of the county committee at this time.

03:06:00.168 --> 03:06:03.470
Petitioners reason for transfer against student safety.

03:06:04.251 --> 03:06:15.938
They believe that home to school commutes to Moreland School District and Campbell High School District are significantly longer and more dangerous than commutes to Cupertino and Fremont, and also community identity.

03:06:16.238 --> 03:06:24.283
They believe they have a stronger sense of community identity with the Cupertino School District and the surrounding neighborhoods.

03:06:30.091 --> 03:06:37.317
Again, a look at just an overview of the transfer area as it relates to the school district boundaries and the schools.

03:06:38.097 --> 03:06:41.120
I'll come back to this when we talk about commute safety issues again.

03:06:41.140 --> 03:06:48.626
But in this case, you have Prospect High School, which is right across the street from the proposed transfer area.

03:06:49.286 --> 03:06:52.269
Linbrook High School, which is just at the north.

03:06:52.669 --> 03:06:53.249
In fact, the

03:06:54.258 --> 03:06:59.403
The footprint of the high school is touching the northern part of the transfer area.

03:06:59.423 --> 03:07:01.045
The football field is down there, I believe.

03:07:02.426 --> 03:07:11.515
Country Lane Elementary, Muir Elementary on the opposite sides, about a mile and a half to Country Lane Elementary, 1.2 miles to Muir Elementary.

03:07:12.075 --> 03:07:17.881
And then the middle schools, Moreland Middle School, also about a mile and a half from the transfer area.

03:07:18.402 --> 03:07:21.686
and Miller Middle School about eight tenths of a mile.

03:07:22.947 --> 03:07:27.252
Again, I'll come back to this when we discuss compute safety issues later.

03:07:29.054 --> 03:07:31.837
Again, all four affected districts oppose the transfer.

03:07:32.839 --> 03:07:36.703
They don't believe that all minimum threshold conditions have been substantially met.

03:07:38.105 --> 03:07:38.825
Again, as was

03:07:40.216 --> 03:07:44.140
talked about earlier that they believe this will set a precedent for future transfers.

03:07:44.981 --> 03:07:49.145
And they don't see any significant reason to approve the transfer.

03:07:49.185 --> 03:07:55.792
So they believe that the primary reason for the petitioner's request is to increase their property values.

03:07:57.334 --> 03:08:01.538
In addition to the points I just listed that all districts share,

03:08:02.395 --> 03:08:21.383
Moreland and Campbell again point to the loss of higher assessed value property from their district that will have negative effects on their financial obligations to repay bond debt for property owners and also affect their bonding capacity as well as their district finances generally.

03:08:22.123 --> 03:08:28.586
Cupertino and Fremont both note that future transfers will continue to overcrowd facilities in the district.

03:08:29.258 --> 03:08:31.000
and increase future construction costs.

03:08:31.060 --> 03:08:37.206
Again, these are issues that were brought up in the area wide study, also issues that were brought up in the previous proposal.

03:08:39.328 --> 03:08:44.673
The county committee found that two of the conditions, the threshold conditions were not substantially met.

03:08:45.294 --> 03:08:51.840
Again, the community identity condition and also the fact that they believe it would increase school facility costs.

03:08:56.306 --> 03:08:58.568
Similar findings to the previous proposal.

03:08:58.648 --> 03:09:04.492
They find that there's no compelling argument that the transfer area is isolated from Moreland and Campbell School District.

03:09:05.553 --> 03:09:13.259
No evidence that the commutes to Moreland and Campbell are less safe than are the commutes to Cupertino and Fremont.

03:09:14.100 --> 03:09:18.543
And that their community identity arguments are not unique to the proposed transfer area.

03:09:21.305 --> 03:09:23.547
We have the same response as we did last time.

03:09:23.747 --> 03:09:25.749
We don't believe that there is a burden

03:09:26.508 --> 03:09:32.030
placed upon the petitioners to prove that their transfer would improve community identity.

03:09:33.211 --> 03:09:35.892
We think that the county committee tends to look at it that way.

03:09:36.412 --> 03:09:44.675
And again, their comments and their actions and their statements seem to support the fact that it doesn't really matter which school district the community is in.

03:09:44.695 --> 03:09:47.556
The community identity is pretty similar.

03:09:51.502 --> 03:10:02.070
In terms of the Condition 7, any increase in school facility cost as a result of the proposed reorganization will be insignificant and otherwise incidental to the reorganization.

03:10:03.311 --> 03:10:10.797
The county finds that both Moreland and Campbell High School District will lose approximately one and a quarter million dollars in bonding capacity.

03:10:11.958 --> 03:10:14.760
They find that enrollment is growing in Cupertino and Fremont.

03:10:14.920 --> 03:10:21.005
Schools in Fremont are already at capacity, over capacity, and transfers would contribute to that.

03:10:21.909 --> 03:10:25.534
They've also used some ransom student generation calculations.

03:10:25.554 --> 03:10:29.058
This is a somewhat larger area than the previous transfer proposals.

03:10:29.699 --> 03:10:38.429
And they calculate that from these calculations, the number of students in the transfer area could reach 68 K-8 students and 36 high school students.

03:10:42.037 --> 03:10:51.761
Our findings regarding the condition, assessed valuation in the area has been growing rapidly by about 40% over the past five years.

03:10:52.222 --> 03:10:59.365
That, in our opinion, offsets any loss, especially a small loss like one and a quarter million from the post-transfer area.

03:10:59.805 --> 03:11:10.210
So we do not find a concern that it's going to deplete the ability of the Campbell school districts to construct

03:11:10.774 --> 03:11:14.095
and also to significantly increase the cost for property owners.

03:11:15.236 --> 03:11:19.157
Cupertino, excuse me, Cupertino enrollment actually is declining.

03:11:20.057 --> 03:11:23.598
It's dropped by about a thousand students since 2014-15.

03:11:24.839 --> 03:11:37.203
And the Fremont High School District, although it's still growing and grown by about 350 students since 2014-15, its own enrollment projections indicate that it will soon start to decline.

03:11:37.844 --> 03:11:40.686
That's kind of a trend that you may pick up on.

03:11:40.726 --> 03:11:42.767
The elementary districts are in decline right now.

03:11:43.548 --> 03:11:47.271
High school districts are still growing, but eventually that's going to move up.

03:11:50.173 --> 03:11:54.836
So we recommend that all of the minimum threshold conditions are substantially met.

03:11:55.596 --> 03:12:04.803
Now we turn to reasons why you might consider overturning or reversing the county committee's action or supporting or affirming the county committee's action.

03:12:05.863 --> 03:12:12.426
As I've already noted, petitioners give us the reasons to consider regarding reversing the action.

03:12:13.307 --> 03:12:23.612
Commutes, again, as I've stated earlier, they believe are less safe to Moreland and Campbell than they are to Fremont and the Cupertino School District.

03:12:24.192 --> 03:12:30.615
Community identity, they believe they have a greater community identity with the Cupertino School District as well as the surrounding neighborhood.

03:12:31.255 --> 03:12:35.922
And they also claim that their unique conditions will not set a precedent for future transfers.

03:12:38.005 --> 03:12:38.767
Back to this map.

03:12:42.973 --> 03:12:46.919
We've already talked about the distances between the schools and the transfer area.

03:12:47.708 --> 03:13:00.335
The primary concern that the petitioners have is the transportation route from the proposed transfer area, particularly to Country Lane Elementary and the Moreland Middle.

03:13:00.355 --> 03:13:02.036
They have to cross Lawrence Expressway.

03:13:03.098 --> 03:13:07.901
And they believe that's a very dangerous transportation route.

03:13:08.381 --> 03:13:11.903
They're also concerned about crossing Prospect High.

03:13:13.184 --> 03:13:20.609
They claim that traffic flows there are greater than would be with the street that goes in front of Lindbergh High School.

03:13:22.930 --> 03:13:31.075
We agree that the route from across Lawrence Expressway is not an ideal route.

03:13:31.977 --> 03:13:35.199
Moreland School District agrees that it's not an ideal school route.

03:13:35.279 --> 03:13:38.622
That's why they offer bus transportation to that area.

03:13:39.482 --> 03:13:41.404
You know, we think that the prospect Lindbrook

03:13:42.574 --> 03:13:51.119
commute differences are non-existent, but I'm sure the petitioners will address that in their public hearing.

03:13:52.320 --> 03:14:07.530
And the petitioners have, in addition to telling us that it's a very dangerous route, they have, as they have reported in their appeal materials and to the county, and I imagine we'll also present here,

03:14:08.203 --> 03:14:12.686
is that they don't allow their students to walk or bike to Country Lane or Moreland Middle.

03:14:13.207 --> 03:14:16.129
They transport their students to school by car.

03:14:16.890 --> 03:14:18.631
And again, they have the option, the bus option.

03:14:21.462 --> 03:14:26.325
So again, I started by saying we agree that it's not an ideal route.

03:14:26.945 --> 03:14:36.590
But as I think board members stated more elegantly than I will right now, this is not a unique circumstance to this area.

03:14:38.031 --> 03:14:41.073
Prospect High School, the attendance area for Prospect High School,

03:14:41.613 --> 03:14:45.356
The vast majority of it is on the other side of Lawrence Expressway.

03:14:45.796 --> 03:14:52.841
The vast majority of students from Prospect High School have to cross Lawrence Expressway in the other direction.

03:14:52.921 --> 03:15:06.731
Fremont Union High School District has indicated in its materials and also in its public hearing, when this was considered locally, that they have 300 students at Limbrook High School who live south of Prospect Road.

03:15:07.652 --> 03:15:18.341
And those students have to transfer, have to travel across Prospect Road, the same road that the petitioner state makes it very dangerous for them to go to Prospect High School.

03:15:19.002 --> 03:15:33.714
In fact, every high school in the attendance area of every high school in Fremont High School District and Campbell High School District is crisscrossed by a freeway, multiple expressways and very

03:15:34.221 --> 03:15:37.664
very busy, other states that are also very busy.

03:15:39.506 --> 03:15:53.978
Thousands of students, by Fremont High School District's estimate, 7,000 of their 12,000 or so students have to make commutes that are across, that are farther and across more congested routes than do students in this area.

03:15:55.679 --> 03:15:59.903
And we find that, given that,

03:16:01.152 --> 03:16:09.433
that the real issue here is not the safety of students walking or biking across Lawrence Expressway.

03:16:09.894 --> 03:16:13.094
Petitioners have already acknowledged that doesn't happen.

03:16:13.614 --> 03:16:15.554
Their students do not walk to those schools.

03:16:15.935 --> 03:16:18.755
Those students do not bike to those schools.

03:16:19.055 --> 03:16:25.236
And again, that's a fairly common, not unique circumstance for school districts and students in this area.

03:16:25.376 --> 03:16:29.877
As was mentioned in the last item, many students are unable to walk

03:16:30.410 --> 03:16:31.391
or bike to schools.

03:16:32.431 --> 03:16:55.182
So really what the compelling issue here is, is there a reason, a compelling reason to transfer, to overturn the county committee's decision based on giving students and residents in this area the opportunity to make a 1.2 mile walk or bike ride

03:16:55.592 --> 03:16:58.974
that takes 25 minutes to walk, 10 minutes to bike.

03:16:59.494 --> 03:17:09.639
Is that a... Is the safety of that over a 10 minute car ride, one and a half mile car ride, is that a compelling reason to overturn the county committee's decision?

03:17:10.759 --> 03:17:11.540
We don't think it is.

03:17:14.421 --> 03:17:16.642
Back to the issue of unique community identity.

03:17:16.962 --> 03:17:22.885
Again, we talked about number three on here, which was a proposal in 2008 that the state board heard and

03:17:25.718 --> 03:17:28.280
and approved the county committee's decision.

03:17:28.420 --> 03:17:33.203
Also finding that there were no commute, significant commute differences between the two districts.

03:17:34.044 --> 03:17:36.205
Number one is the current transfer area.

03:17:36.997 --> 03:17:42.322
Number two is the area just to the east of the transfer area.

03:17:43.043 --> 03:17:49.189
And number four is an area that is south of Prospect Road.

03:17:49.569 --> 03:17:55.595
Again, all four of these areas share similar transportation concerns and issues.

03:17:55.615 --> 03:18:00.400
So we do not find that the Westbrook area has unique circumstances.

03:18:05.814 --> 03:18:14.681
Again, as I mentioned in the last item, you can look at reasons to help you make a decision to affirm the county committee's action.

03:18:15.362 --> 03:18:23.809
One again is that the reorganization study shows that territory transfers like this do not address issues.

03:18:24.089 --> 03:18:27.832
They simply change the boundary and move the issues to other neighborhoods.

03:18:28.638 --> 03:18:34.083
All the districts affected expressed concerns that approval will encourage future territory transfers.

03:18:34.123 --> 03:18:38.126
And again, that was a finding in the study that the county completed.

03:18:40.188 --> 03:18:43.270
Same other potential concerns that we talked about last time.

03:18:43.831 --> 03:18:51.157
If we extend more and more transfers out of the Moreland and Campbell school district into Cupertino and Fremont,

03:18:51.656 --> 03:18:59.178
Enrollment growth from future transfers will place pressure on the future ability of those districts to house their students and offer educational programs.

03:19:00.078 --> 03:19:09.121
They also could cause fiscal difficulties for Moreland and Campbell, again, because of the loss of assessed valuation and the effects it would have on district finances.

03:19:09.963 --> 03:19:23.292
And again, even though we don't find that the transfers are being put forward primarily for the purpose of increasing property values, that certainly is a concern of the districts and also may be an issue that you may want to consider.

03:19:24.533 --> 03:19:32.038
In summary, again, we find that all minimum threshold conditions are substantially met, including the two the county committee found were not.

03:19:32.758 --> 03:19:37.081
We find no reason that's compelling enough to overturn the county committee's disapproval.

03:19:38.052 --> 03:19:46.158
We do see concerns that are substantial enough to make a decision to support or affirm the County Committee's action.

03:19:46.558 --> 03:19:50.841
So we're recommending that the State Board affirm County Committee's approval.

03:19:52.623 --> 03:19:54.324
Again, you may affirm or reverse.

03:19:55.405 --> 03:19:58.427
If you reverse, you need to establish an election area.

03:19:59.236 --> 03:20:09.402
And I'll conclude by restating our recommendation to support the county committee's decision by affirming its action to disapprove the territory transfer.

03:20:09.422 --> 03:20:14.224
I'll be happy to answer any questions now or after the public hearing public comment.

03:20:15.325 --> 03:20:15.705
Thank you.

03:20:15.885 --> 03:20:16.125
OK.

03:20:16.145 --> 03:20:18.186
I think we should open the public hearing first.

03:20:20.908 --> 03:20:25.390
And so the proponents for the transfer will have 10 minutes.

03:20:25.530 --> 03:20:28.552
I now proclaim the public hearing open.

03:20:50.487 --> 03:21:00.109
Good morning, my name is Bill Martin and I'm a little bit rummy right now because I got up at oh dark 30 to drive up here About two and a half hour ride.

03:21:00.830 --> 03:21:15.233
I rode up with Katie who drove she's an excellent Driver and Judy my my neighbor and Geithra Katie works for PayPal Judy works for Google I throw works for Kaiser.

03:21:16.173 --> 03:21:16.813
I'm retired.

03:21:16.933 --> 03:21:19.354
I'm a retired judge and I was

03:21:19.734 --> 03:21:37.177
Prepared to rant and rave about the hearing down below but the the staff report Vindicates a lot of our positions on that and I don't need I'm gonna spare you that Thank you for that I've moved into my house in 1984.

03:21:37.537 --> 03:21:40.118
I live in the district.

03:21:40.178 --> 03:21:47.139
I'm about a five-minute walk Leisurely walk to the back gate of Linnbrook High School Down Walbrook Drive.

03:21:47.179 --> 03:21:48.299
It's a residential street

03:21:49.113 --> 03:21:53.074
Most of my neighbors are within spitting distance of Lundbrook High School.

03:21:53.735 --> 03:21:57.336
When the public address goes, we all hear it.

03:21:58.436 --> 03:22:01.117
When they play football, the lights shine in our backyards.

03:22:02.338 --> 03:22:06.859
When the football team is looking for donations, they come to my door.

03:22:07.820 --> 03:22:08.500
I give them money.

03:22:09.540 --> 03:22:12.481
And then I say, but sorry guys, we're not in that district.

03:22:12.801 --> 03:22:13.822
And they go, what?

03:22:14.722 --> 03:22:15.882
It doesn't make any sense.

03:22:15.963 --> 03:22:17.103
About 50 years ago,

03:22:18.689 --> 03:22:26.213
Our neighborhood was gerrymandered out of what should be the Fremont Union High School District and the Cooperton Union School District.

03:22:27.034 --> 03:22:31.516
If you look at the map, the district line falls Saratoga Creek South.

03:22:32.316 --> 03:22:35.638
My house backs up on the creek, so I'm looking at it when it rains.

03:22:36.338 --> 03:22:43.202
And then it jogs over and cuts out our neighborhood, goes west, and then goes down and crosses Prospect Road.

03:22:44.048 --> 03:22:45.310
It's a natural boundary.

03:22:45.591 --> 03:22:48.716
I don't know anybody on the other side of the creek or very few.

03:22:48.796 --> 03:22:49.437
I wave to them.

03:22:50.038 --> 03:22:51.561
I know a lot of folks on my side.

03:22:51.621 --> 03:22:52.602
It's a sense of neighborhood.

03:22:52.622 --> 03:22:53.384
I want to talk about

03:22:54.028 --> 03:22:56.469
community sense of neighborhood and things of that sort.

03:22:57.870 --> 03:23:07.716
So 50 years, our kids have gone to other school districts as outlined in the maps and been denied the right to be participants in our local community.

03:23:08.676 --> 03:23:10.598
And there are safety issues, of course.

03:23:10.738 --> 03:23:12.439
You've heard the pros and cons on that.

03:23:13.039 --> 03:23:14.420
We're not going to be able to change that here.

03:23:14.480 --> 03:23:17.421
Some folks here have talked about we can't do anything about that here.

03:23:18.142 --> 03:23:18.302
But

03:23:20.905 --> 03:23:23.566
What I would like, I agreed with the staff report.

03:23:23.626 --> 03:23:28.029
I don't know where Larry went, but I thought it was a good report.

03:23:28.109 --> 03:23:28.689
I'm a judge.

03:23:29.029 --> 03:23:31.791
Some lawyer wrote that, I think, it looks like to me.

03:23:31.811 --> 03:23:33.091
It's a good report.

03:23:33.131 --> 03:23:38.434
The only thing I disagree with is the two findings against us, which are, we're not unique.

03:23:38.494 --> 03:23:39.175
We are unique.

03:23:39.275 --> 03:23:41.336
We border on Lindbrook High School.

03:23:41.356 --> 03:23:42.576
We're right there on the border.

03:23:42.676 --> 03:23:45.538
If it had been drawn the right way, we would be included in that district.

03:23:46.338 --> 03:23:47.519
And the other thing is that

03:23:48.808 --> 03:23:55.531
With respect, some folks here have said, well, we're not the proper body to deal with these kinds of district redistricting.

03:23:55.871 --> 03:23:56.471
Line drawing.

03:23:57.292 --> 03:24:00.933
Line drawing is one of the toughest thing that folks ever have to do, including judges.

03:24:01.554 --> 03:24:06.456
And the education code provides for this process.

03:24:07.396 --> 03:24:12.058
If legitimate appeals, which I think ours is, are turned down to

03:24:13.649 --> 03:24:23.256
to dissuade other folks from making appeals because you'll be overrun with appeals for transfers, then what's the point of the education code section?

03:24:23.596 --> 03:24:24.477
I think that's wrong.

03:24:24.917 --> 03:24:40.328
I think you should, on a case-by-case basis, until the code gets changed, grant our petition, reverse the county committee, and allow us to have our neighborhood made whole with the folks that we

03:24:41.755 --> 03:24:42.355
feel part of.

03:24:42.616 --> 03:24:47.879
When we go to the park, we go to Rainbow Park, which is, you know, right down, right across from Linbrook.

03:24:47.919 --> 03:24:54.083
When we, when we, my daughters went to Margrone, but my older daughter played basketball at Prospect.

03:24:54.964 --> 03:24:56.605
We would go down to Linbrook to practice.

03:24:57.205 --> 03:24:58.206
We didn't go to Prospect.

03:24:59.607 --> 03:25:00.988
It's just, it's ridiculous.

03:25:01.328 --> 03:25:02.789
And I've got to shut up.

03:25:02.889 --> 03:25:04.350
I've been told here by my colleague.

03:25:04.930 --> 03:25:06.171
Thank you for your attention.

03:25:08.539 --> 03:25:09.380
I'm Judy Chang.

03:25:10.641 --> 03:25:16.305
I've been a resident of Westbrook with my husband, who is a California public school teacher for 19 years.

03:25:17.326 --> 03:25:26.113
And our request to transfer was prompted by the 2014 death of a 15 year old Cupertino student named Ethan Wong.

03:25:26.873 --> 03:25:30.736
Ethan was an aspiring Eagle Scout, a very good piano player.

03:25:31.337 --> 03:25:38.222
He was killed while he was wearing his bike helmet, riding his bike in a bike lane on a very busy four lane road to high school.

03:25:40.254 --> 03:25:50.377
A 17-year-old Prospect High School student was hit by a car, luckily not killed, but put into a coma trying to cross Prospect Road.

03:25:51.077 --> 03:26:09.462
These are the incidences that drove us to ask why our kids' commute paths to schools need to be as dangerous as they are when, unlike other students that you may have heard other commutes mentioned, we have a safe route in our backyards that we are not allowed to use and we just don't understand it.

03:26:12.236 --> 03:26:19.667
So you can see in this slide in the green are the paths that we would take to go to the CUSD and FUHSD schools.

03:26:20.188 --> 03:26:25.576
These are all along two lane, 25 mile per hour roads with sidewalks.

03:26:27.737 --> 03:26:30.880
contrast that with the path we have to take on the red dashes.

03:26:31.301 --> 03:26:34.744
And those of you familiar with our local area know that I'm telling you the truth.

03:26:34.764 --> 03:26:41.210
When I tell you that Prospect Road, even though the speed limit is 40 miles per hour, people drive a lot faster than that.

03:26:41.611 --> 03:26:43.613
Lawrence Expressway is six lanes.

03:26:44.013 --> 03:26:44.814
It is congested.

03:26:46.502 --> 03:26:56.905
So our kids would have a much nicer commute to school walking and biking than their current situation of being taking buses, which, by the way, they have to board one hour before school starts.

03:26:57.405 --> 03:27:01.786
One hour instead of being able to take a five or 10 minute walk or bike to school.

03:27:07.808 --> 03:27:10.489
To put it concretely, we have

03:27:11.198 --> 03:27:13.982
Two-lane roads in Brooklyn, they see 470 cars a day.

03:27:14.002 --> 03:27:16.805
Prospect Road sees 25,000 cars a day on its four-lane road.

03:27:24.019 --> 03:27:28.923
Also, speed and traffic matter because they result in more accidents.

03:27:29.083 --> 03:27:32.906
And you can see the data from the San Jose Fire Department backs this up.

03:27:33.386 --> 03:27:43.213
There were four and a half times more medical response incidences along the pathways leading to our current schools compared to our proposed schools.

03:27:43.894 --> 03:27:46.936
Now I'm going to turn it over to Katie to talk to you about community identity.

03:27:50.185 --> 03:27:50.645
Thanks, Judy.

03:27:51.946 --> 03:27:58.089
I'm Katie Oceano, and my son Marcus is a first grader at Country Lane Elementary in the Moreland District.

03:27:58.910 --> 03:28:08.475
I've lived on a daily basis the snarled, congested, and dangerous commute from our house in the Westbrook Nip District over to Country Lane.

03:28:09.336 --> 03:28:17.160
I want my son to be able to walk or bike to school on safe roads without putting him in a hard way, and we have that option in front of us, and it's easy to do.

03:28:18.580 --> 03:28:35.025
You saw the maps, you can see that our route today to Country Lane Elementary, to our middle school, crosses Prospect Road, crosses Lawrence Expressway, it goes in front of malls, including the Westgate Mall, Westgate West, Paseo Saratoga, and these are the routes to get to 85 and 280.

03:28:35.145 --> 03:28:43.508
So you have speeding cars, you have commuters, you have commercial traffic, construction traffic, day in and day out, and it gets worse every year.

03:28:45.269 --> 03:28:48.571
We need your help to vote to overturn the county decision.

03:28:48.591 --> 03:28:56.918
And so I want to talk to you today a little bit about the community and some of the facts that we're thinking that will support this.

03:28:58.279 --> 03:28:59.720
Our Westbrook neighborhood is 26 kids and

03:29:02.702 --> 03:29:04.264
we are very uniquely situated.

03:29:04.825 --> 03:29:07.870
Our identity is strongly tied with the Cupertino neighborhood.

03:29:07.930 --> 03:29:10.894
You can see on this map here our park is Rainbow Park.

03:29:11.976 --> 03:29:18.085
This is our backyard where we send our kids to go play because we know that the roads are safe and we know that they can get there safely.

03:29:19.406 --> 03:29:30.252
We're isolated from the Moreland and Campbell schools on the basis of the obstacles that I mentioned before, the creek, Prospect Road, and then those busy intersections to get over to the Moreland and Campbell schools.

03:29:31.112 --> 03:29:37.956
Our kids uniquely can walk and bike to the Cupertino schools on quiet neighborhood streets, and we are the only neighborhood that can claim this.

03:29:38.456 --> 03:29:38.936
It's unique.

03:29:40.778 --> 03:29:52.307
We're looking for a solution that is durable on the basis of the merits of our case and the unique isolation of our neighborhood, which will help us solve some of these safety issues and keep our kids safe.

03:29:56.211 --> 03:29:59.794
So because of the Westbrook District and these safety challenges,

03:30:03.403 --> 03:30:08.286
All of our community and school ties are linked to the Cupertino and Fremont schools today.

03:30:08.807 --> 03:30:17.794
As an example, our neighborhood is part of AYSO 64, which has every player on the team attending Cupertino schools except for the kids from our neighborhood.

03:30:18.314 --> 03:30:21.257
The practices are held at Cupertino School, Miller Middle School.

03:30:22.898 --> 03:30:27.481
The reorganization of this district will help with our community identity.

03:30:28.682 --> 03:30:34.887
and also make sure that we are supporting the neighborhood that we have nestled today.

03:30:38.089 --> 03:30:48.016
Okay, well, by past enrollment, I think you saw some of the stats around declining enrollment in the Cupertino District and rising enrollment in the Fremont District.

03:30:48.116 --> 03:30:53.719
And as a reminder, our 26 kids represent less than one-tenth of 1% of the Fremont District enrollment.

03:30:55.180 --> 03:31:00.302
In summary, I would argue that we can't paint all transfer requests with the same brush.

03:31:01.382 --> 03:31:04.363
Our kids have historically attended these Cupertino schools.

03:31:05.083 --> 03:31:06.443
We're uniquely isolated.

03:31:06.503 --> 03:31:14.485
We're in a very unique situation where our kids can and should be able to walk or bike to the Cupertino schools on quiet neighborhood streets.

03:31:14.765 --> 03:31:15.966
Nobody else can make that claim.

03:31:16.546 --> 03:31:20.247
We already share parks and sports districts with these schools.

03:31:20.367 --> 03:31:20.947
Thank you so much.

03:31:24.653 --> 03:31:28.289
Okay, now the opponents to the transfer have 10 minutes.

03:31:28.510 --> 03:31:29.314
Please come forward.

03:31:39.949 --> 03:31:42.352
I can say good afternoon now instead of good morning.

03:31:43.433 --> 03:31:49.599
I was going to deliver a public comment, but I thought I'd make use of this time instead to read my statement.

03:31:50.560 --> 03:31:51.962
So good morning again or good afternoon.

03:31:52.322 --> 03:31:57.368
David Villegas here on behalf of Dr. Mary Ann Dewan, Santa Clara County Superintendent of Schools.

03:31:59.377 --> 03:32:08.042
Superintendent DeJuan and the county office supports the county office analysis, the CDE staff recommendation, and the county committee's unanimous denial of this reorganization request.

03:32:08.763 --> 03:32:14.026
The Santa Clara County Committee has heard reorganization issues affecting school districts in the area for over 20 years.

03:32:14.486 --> 03:32:27.675
Once more, the Santa Clara County, the Santa Clara County Office of Education stands behind a 1997 area-wide study assessing the impact of multiple reorganization requests affecting districts in the western part of Santa Clara County.

03:32:28.375 --> 03:32:35.460
A general finding from that study is that piecemeal adjustments to district boundaries such as this one shift community identity problems.

03:32:36.060 --> 03:32:45.126
In response to that study, the Santa Clara County Committee adopted guidelines for addressing reorganization issues that are based primarily on issues of commute time and safety.

03:32:46.407 --> 03:32:53.091
Regarding this particular transfer request, I would like to emphasize that each of the affected districts provided a resolution in opposition.

03:32:53.891 --> 03:33:01.716
Unable to attend today's meeting, Moreland School District Superintendent Mary Going has supplied a letter in opposition to this transfer request.

03:33:01.816 --> 03:33:10.901
In her letter, Superintendent Going states that the petitioner's request for transfer of territory will not enhance the community identity, will not better traffic conditions,

03:33:11.479 --> 03:33:16.583
and will have a negative financial impact on Moreland School District, which is not a community funded district.

03:33:17.384 --> 03:33:25.731
It is estimated that the transfer would result in the loss of approximately $170,000 annually due to decreased student enrollment and the loss of approximately $17,500 annually in parcel tax revenue to the district.

03:33:30.250 --> 03:33:32.011
So a copy of that letter has been provided.

03:33:32.691 --> 03:33:43.497
And unfortunately, Campbell Union High School District Superintendent Bravo could not stay and has asked me to relay that he supports the denial of this reorganization request.

03:33:43.977 --> 03:33:44.258
Thank you.

03:33:46.018 --> 03:33:46.239
Okay.

03:33:47.439 --> 03:33:52.562
I now declare the public hearing closed and we're ready for public comment.

03:33:53.646 --> 03:33:56.328
With the following speakers, please line up at the podium.

03:33:57.148 --> 03:34:06.114
Robert Bravo, Bill Martin, Judy Chang, Katie Ochiano, Gayatro Auchel, Bill McCartney, Destiny McCartney.

03:34:21.404 --> 03:34:22.425
Good morning, everybody.

03:34:22.861 --> 03:34:24.242
My name is Gayatri Achi.

03:34:25.102 --> 03:34:32.066
And I actually came on board just as a support system, but I decided that I'm going to speak.

03:34:32.246 --> 03:34:39.269
So all these, all the people, when they all come up, they always talk about finances, you know, always financial.

03:34:40.130 --> 03:34:43.951
But I moved into this neighborhood back in, well, I came to California in 84.

03:34:45.132 --> 03:34:47.173
And it was a very small community.

03:34:47.233 --> 03:34:50.835
There wasn't a lot of cars, you know, not like it is right now.

03:34:52.035 --> 03:34:54.916
And when I went to, I went to Cupertino High School, actually.

03:34:55.196 --> 03:34:56.336
And it was a really great school.

03:34:56.356 --> 03:34:58.956
We were going to go to San Francisco, but we came up to Cupertino.

03:34:59.737 --> 03:35:03.397
But I just wanted to say it's not about finances for any of us.

03:35:03.777 --> 03:35:06.018
It's about the kids and community.

03:35:06.578 --> 03:35:10.098
And when I grew up, you know, I didn't really feel like I belonged.

03:35:10.118 --> 03:35:11.659
So I really understand.

03:35:11.699 --> 03:35:18.980
I don't have kids, but I understand what Judy and them are saying when they're trying to put their kids into a group and the group doesn't like them.

03:35:19.640 --> 03:35:20.141
I get it.

03:35:20.782 --> 03:35:22.084
And it's really not fun.

03:35:22.645 --> 03:35:25.029
And the few people that can let the people come in.

03:35:25.049 --> 03:35:28.113
So, you know, it's all about community and family.

03:35:28.394 --> 03:35:30.056
So I just want to say it's not finance.

03:35:30.557 --> 03:35:31.378
It's about community.

03:35:31.679 --> 03:35:32.380
So thank you.

03:35:37.776 --> 03:35:38.377
Good afternoon.

03:35:39.057 --> 03:35:40.018
My name is Bill McCartney.

03:35:40.058 --> 03:35:46.105
I'm here with my wife, Destiny, and we traveled here today because this is an issue that really matters for our family.

03:35:46.626 --> 03:35:49.849
We have three children, ages five, three, and one.

03:35:50.410 --> 03:35:53.994
So they each have 12 or 13 years of public school ahead of them.

03:35:54.875 --> 03:36:08.430
Under the current districting, our kids will have to travel to schools that are twice as far away and across multiple busy streets, including the Lawrence Expressway, six lanes of traffic moving at 50 miles an hour.

03:36:10.231 --> 03:36:12.572
And schools that don't feel like part of our neighborhood.

03:36:13.172 --> 03:36:15.233
Limbrook High School is right down the street from us.

03:36:15.393 --> 03:36:18.614
In fact, the entrance to the football field is eight doors down.

03:36:18.854 --> 03:36:20.975
It's 200 yards from our door.

03:36:21.355 --> 03:36:22.756
It's an easy five minute walk.

03:36:22.836 --> 03:36:28.458
It's so close that on warm evenings in the fall, we can easily hear the marching band practicing.

03:36:29.078 --> 03:36:32.339
And we often take the kids to walk down to watch them.

03:36:33.060 --> 03:36:33.760
I brought photos.

03:36:35.601 --> 03:36:39.884
On weekends, we often go for a family walk around the school track.

03:36:40.544 --> 03:36:43.206
We even attended the homecoming football game.

03:36:43.846 --> 03:36:53.193
I don't have any photos from Prospect High School because their football field is eight times as far away, and it's across a very dangerous intersection.

03:36:53.673 --> 03:36:54.574
I'll hand off to my wife.

03:36:55.799 --> 03:36:57.139
My name is Destiny McCartney.

03:36:57.759 --> 03:37:03.541
We would really love for our kids to be able to walk to school safely in our own neighborhood.

03:37:04.101 --> 03:37:06.262
With the morning schools, that's just not possible.

03:37:07.242 --> 03:37:11.283
Take Country Lane Elementary, where our daughter just started kindergarten.

03:37:11.943 --> 03:37:17.044
It's 1.6 miles from home, but getting there requires crossing the Lawrence Expressway.

03:37:17.544 --> 03:37:20.365
Six lanes of traffic moving at 50 miles per hour.

03:37:20.925 --> 03:37:24.606
You can't let a kid make that walk to school, not even a big kid.

03:37:25.905 --> 03:37:27.626
At the middle school level, it's even worse.

03:37:28.167 --> 03:37:35.091
More than middle school is 1.8 miles away and it requires not one, but three dangerous intersections.

03:37:36.072 --> 03:37:38.353
But the Pocopatino schools are half the distance.

03:37:38.994 --> 03:37:45.078
More importantly, you can walk there on neighborhood streets safely with little traffic.

03:37:46.819 --> 03:37:49.261
These schools need students and we want to go.

03:37:50.442 --> 03:37:51.963
Please make it happen.

03:37:52.063 --> 03:37:52.343
Thank you.

03:37:55.458 --> 03:37:57.744
Okay, that concludes the public comment.

03:37:57.844 --> 03:38:04.181
I guess now we're ready for Board Member Holliday's comments as liaison.

03:38:06.394 --> 03:38:11.856
Well, first of all, I want to thank Superintendent Thurmond for his comments after the last item.

03:38:11.876 --> 03:38:26.261
I do think it's an excellent suggestion he made to follow up on these items and see what other action can be taken to help.

03:38:26.381 --> 03:38:33.264
And a member does this suggestion of some leniency

03:38:34.623 --> 03:38:36.585
from one district or another could be very useful.

03:38:40.029 --> 03:38:53.263
I do agree with the retired judge who reminded us that we do look at each one of these cases separately, that we don't lump them together.

03:38:55.084 --> 03:39:11.609
the details about each one of the The requests the appeals and we do consider the appeals as Opportunities for this board to take action, there's no doubt about that however

03:39:12.170 --> 03:39:22.937
I come back to the reality of this area, this situation, and these commutes and travel times and all the rest.

03:39:23.577 --> 03:39:33.723
I feel, once again, very, very sorry for families that have to drive their kids instead of having the kids walk two or three blocks down the road.

03:39:34.904 --> 03:39:39.727
We just point to these sorts of examples everywhere throughout the state of California.

03:39:40.489 --> 03:39:52.619
When Larry says to us that the threshold conditions have been substantially met, that's not difficult to do.

03:39:54.100 --> 03:39:57.283
To reach the minimum threshold is a pretty low bar.

03:39:58.203 --> 03:40:10.133
And because the minimum thresholds have been met does not automatically trigger our accepting the appeal or the petition.

03:40:10.988 --> 03:40:30.468
If so, that would have happened at the at the local level Instead we have to look at this as truly a compelling significant reason beyond the minimum thresholds and Once again with all due apologies and respect to the petitioners.

03:40:30.488 --> 03:40:33.031
I think that this is not a

03:40:33.831 --> 03:40:56.441
Compelling because we see this in so many places throughout, California and Therefore I would recommend the CDE's Recommendation I would move the CDE's recommendation Second by super Any further any board members yes board member burr

03:40:58.044 --> 03:41:11.497
First, I just want to echo what Board Member Holliday said and my commendation to Superintendent Thurmond for his careful consideration of the issues and some ideas that might be helpful from the State Department.

03:41:12.118 --> 03:41:20.546
But the one, and I also want to really call out my colleague, Board Member Valdez, because there are options available at the local level, meaning

03:41:21.667 --> 03:41:23.469
namely inter-district transfers.

03:41:24.150 --> 03:41:38.804
And where this particular circumstance does seem compelling because of the geographic arrangements and the traffic and all of that, I haven't heard folks talk about, gee, we tried to go to the other district and ask if we could go there and they turned us down.

03:41:40.206 --> 03:41:54.302
So I just want to make sure that people are aware of those opportunities at the local level Because as board member holiday said we have circumstances like this all over the state as communities have grown out and

03:41:54.782 --> 03:42:01.186
boundaries do not coincide with city jurisdictions or in some cases county jurisdictions.

03:42:01.767 --> 03:42:10.833
So we can't solve those problems here but I just want to make sure that people know they do have local options and I would encourage you to pursue those.

03:42:10.853 --> 03:42:14.135
Board Member Williams.

03:42:15.976 --> 03:42:20.319
Do you know whether or not a request was made for an inter-district transfer and was denied?

03:42:22.081 --> 03:42:38.414
According to the information I got from the districts and also some information that was contained in Mary Ann Goings' letter to you, Superintendent of Moreland, both the Cupertino and the Moreland School District report that they hadn't received any inter-district transfer request.

03:42:38.434 --> 03:42:38.894
They have not.

03:42:39.374 --> 03:42:45.179
I will counter that quickly with one of the petitioners who, when we gathered that information and shared it with them,

03:42:45.680 --> 03:42:55.766
They noted that her children did at one point attend Cupertino School District on an inter-district transfer of some sort.

03:42:56.426 --> 03:43:02.469
So, you know, it's information from the districts is that we haven't received any, at least the elementary districts.

03:43:05.551 --> 03:43:12.655
And the counter information from the petitioners is that, well, my kids were attending Cupertino at one point in time.

03:43:13.114 --> 03:43:35.195
Because if it's true that Cupertino is declining in enrollment, which I think was on one of the slides, there was mixed information about whether it was or wasn't, but I think one of your slides said it is, and if some of these houses are that close, it would surprise me that Cupertino wouldn't grant an inter-district transfer.

03:43:36.596 --> 03:43:44.044
Well, you know, and I agree with you that if they were looking at to control, to increase their enrollment, that would be, that could be an option.

03:43:44.924 --> 03:43:53.033
But I will also jump in and state that these are wider issues than just a few neighborhoods that are next to the boundary.

03:43:53.675 --> 03:44:00.617
Cupertino and Fremont, as I began in the first item, are very desirable districts.

03:44:01.157 --> 03:44:05.678
So they have a lot of people, not just people on the boundary, trying to get into the districts.

03:44:05.718 --> 03:44:12.240
And they offer fairly strict or they use fairly strict criteria to approve inter-district transfers.

03:44:12.700 --> 03:44:21.423
That said, I'll also add that there is another option, is that the County Board of Education hears appeals of inter-district transfers that have been denied

03:44:21.983 --> 03:44:22.845
by school districts.

03:44:23.245 --> 03:44:30.338
And I know that in Santa Clara County, one of the criteria they use in those appeals is safety of students.

03:44:33.739 --> 03:44:34.500
I wanted to comment.

03:44:34.540 --> 03:44:40.466
I live in Santa Clara County, too, and I actually was last week shopping in this very area.

03:44:40.706 --> 03:44:49.354
Lawrence Expressway and Crass Prospect and went to El Camino and Lawrence to shop at Big Lots and Lucky.

03:44:50.636 --> 03:44:54.399
So I now and I do this and no.

03:44:55.240 --> 03:45:01.981
And so I've been doing this for 15 years now with these reorganizations, and the safety issue is a new one to me.

03:45:03.562 --> 03:45:08.963
My impression of these streets is there's a heck of a lot of stoplights.

03:45:09.783 --> 03:45:12.203
My main complaint is I can't get any speed.

03:45:13.563 --> 03:45:18.664
And they stop me, and these roads are really congested.

03:45:18.744 --> 03:45:22.065
So I don't see how the safety and

03:45:22.845 --> 03:45:27.428
I've never gotten to 50 miles an hour in these roads and would maybe like to.

03:45:29.069 --> 03:45:35.153
So I think these arguments about what these roads are like and so on, it's difficult.

03:45:35.813 --> 03:45:39.255
They sure are congested, but they have a lot of lights.

03:45:39.355 --> 03:45:41.137
So to me, you go through the lights.

03:45:43.198 --> 03:45:45.219
You know, you wait for the lights and then go on.

03:45:45.279 --> 03:45:53.205
And so I think it's difficult to really get into these safety issues in so much detail.

03:45:53.325 --> 03:45:58.969
And we would need a lot of information if this is going to be a frequent argument.

03:46:00.490 --> 03:46:09.073
Larry, I would urge we get a little bit more information on what this is really like because I have trouble grasping it.

03:46:09.514 --> 03:46:23.559
Well, in defense of the petitioners, as I noted earlier, because of the number of transfers that the county was receiving over the past 25 years, they did adopt that geographic isolation.

03:46:24.259 --> 03:46:24.719
condition.

03:46:25.320 --> 03:46:31.883
And that pretty much tells anyone who wants to, in this area, want to transfer is they need to meet that condition.

03:46:32.423 --> 03:46:40.307
So in order to meet that condition, they need to make arguments about safety of commute and the commute issue.

03:46:40.327 --> 03:46:42.748
So that's why I think that you're right.

03:46:42.948 --> 03:46:48.371
We don't usually see this issue in territory transfer appeals or in any kind of reorganization issue.

03:46:48.931 --> 03:46:53.373
But it is fairly common and it's probably going to be the primary argument

03:46:53.713 --> 03:46:58.154
that you will see coming out of petitions of transfer territory in this area.

03:46:58.635 --> 03:47:08.918
OK, well, I just we need to think about how to analyze this, it seems to me, to get more information about, you know, these are very complex traffic patterns.

03:47:10.218 --> 03:47:10.598
Thank you.

03:47:10.638 --> 03:47:27.284
So on the previous redistricting item, as a couple of board members mentioned, the superintendent did ask staff to look, you know, reach out to the local jurisdictions, the districts and the municipalities and see what can be done to create

03:47:28.104 --> 03:47:30.606
safer travel routes to schools.

03:47:31.447 --> 03:47:32.448
We'll certainly do that.

03:47:32.488 --> 03:47:47.100
We'll also look into or ask the districts to look at their inter-district transfer policies to see what can be, what flexibility or what can be done to accommodate circumstances such as this.

03:47:47.240 --> 03:47:56.668
And we'll also, you know, again, reach out to the county for a continued discussion and report back.

03:47:57.268 --> 03:48:25.366
to us and the board sort of on their maybe an update of the report that was done in the early 90s or any other changes that they might want to think about given the demographic changes and the changes in the population of the area and, you know, the routes that students need to take to schools now in the area.

03:48:28.507 --> 03:48:29.348
Board Member Rocker.

03:48:30.029 --> 03:48:42.404
I just want to say the one thing that was lost in the conversation for me that I actually found shocking, even though bus transportation is provided, there's a fee of $390 for that, which I found absolutely

03:48:46.429 --> 03:48:47.830
amazing and appalling.

03:48:48.330 --> 03:48:57.913
But while that's not, while that is maybe a mitigating factor for, it's not something that we can consider because that is a local issue and a local concern.

03:48:58.473 --> 03:49:10.178
All of these appeals, whether we're talking about the appeals we've had today or the multiple types of appeals like this that we have seen in the time I've served on the board, it always is about the boundary.

03:49:10.198 --> 03:49:13.559
To be honest with you, I have never seen a neighborhood

03:49:13.979 --> 03:49:23.662
that's located smack dab in the middle of a school district, making some requests or some consideration about this primarily because they're landlocked.

03:49:23.682 --> 03:49:26.223
They couldn't do anything about the transfer anyway.

03:49:26.723 --> 03:49:35.646
And I know for the people who have come here today looking at this appeal, hearing us say that all of these boundary issues remain unchanged.

03:49:35.666 --> 03:49:42.268
If we move this boundary today, there'll be a new set of neighborhoods on the new boundary that will have the same concern.

03:49:43.189 --> 03:50:05.932
It's not to write it off or to diminish what your concerns are, but the reality is there is a large picture, a totality of circumstances that both have to be considered, not only on a statewide level, but the impact and sustained effect that it has on all of the districts and all the neighborhoods that would be impacted by the appeal and by this decision.

03:50:06.392 --> 03:50:13.538
And so, again, I want to thank you for making the concerted effort that you made today and giving the explanation that you gave today.

03:50:13.578 --> 03:50:17.641
But I also agree we need to support what the local decision was.

03:50:17.661 --> 03:50:21.004
All right.

03:50:21.064 --> 03:50:28.890
Hearing no further discussion, all those in favor of the CDE recommendation to deny the petition, raise your hands.

03:50:30.540 --> 03:50:31.300
Those opposed?

03:50:32.320 --> 03:50:33.341
Okay, it passes.

03:50:34.681 --> 03:50:37.041
So the lunch is... Not here yet.

03:50:37.361 --> 03:50:38.002
Not here yet.

03:50:38.182 --> 03:50:38.582
Okay.

03:50:39.342 --> 03:50:51.244
So we will continue on then with... Now we're ready for action item eight, which is the assessment and item, multiple items as usual.

03:50:56.745 --> 03:50:57.445
Good afternoon.

03:50:58.906 --> 03:50:59.626
President Kirst.

03:51:03.092 --> 03:51:05.753
Hello, I was just making sure he's ready.

03:51:06.474 --> 03:51:13.497
President Kirsch, members of the board, Deputy Superintendent Schweitzer, good morning, Michelle Center, Director of the Assessment Division.

03:51:14.517 --> 03:51:16.278
Glad to be before you this afternoon.

03:51:17.218 --> 03:51:22.621
The item before you is both an information item as well as an item for your action.

03:51:22.641 --> 03:51:27.943
Yeah, it's a little loud.

03:51:54.217 --> 03:51:54.597
Are you ready?

03:51:54.838 --> 03:51:56.378
Okay, it's a little quieter now.

03:51:56.678 --> 03:52:02.061
So I do not have a PowerPoint for you today, just my smiley face.

03:52:03.082 --> 03:52:09.745
Not quite as smiley as I'm sure Melanie will be later, but you know, this is what you get.

03:52:10.405 --> 03:52:15.207
So, the item before you today, like I said, is for information as well as action.

03:52:16.068 --> 03:52:26.632
I will be asking the board to approve the LEA apportionment rates for tests administered as part of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress, or CASP, during the 18-19 school year.

03:52:29.093 --> 03:52:37.277
This item will also provide you an update on the CASP as well as the English Language Proficiency Assessment for California or LPAC.

03:52:38.077 --> 03:52:46.962
In November 2018, this board approved that we amend the contract with Educational Testing Service or ETS.

03:52:48.062 --> 03:52:52.824
In doing so, we incorporated the LPAC within the same contract as the CASP.

03:52:53.305 --> 03:53:08.432
And so you will see for the first time we have provided an assessment update for you that combines both of those programs into a single item, given they will be utilizing the same contractor and the same infrastructure moving forward, it seemed appropriate to do so.

03:53:10.126 --> 03:53:20.995
So let me begin first by giving you a brief update on CASP and LPAC, and then I will return back on the action that I'm asking you to take today.

03:53:21.976 --> 03:53:24.098
So let's start with an update on LPAC.

03:53:25.439 --> 03:53:29.762
As a reminder, the LPAC consists of both the initial LPAC as well as the summative LPAC.

03:53:30.522 --> 03:53:34.705
The initial went operational on July 1 of 2018.

03:53:35.586 --> 03:53:42.350
And the initial LPAC is used to determine the English proficiency of students entering California schools for the first time.

03:53:43.111 --> 03:53:46.433
These are students whose primary language is not English.

03:53:46.453 --> 03:53:54.719
And those results are locally scored by our districts to produce an official score, an official status of English proficiency for those students.

03:53:55.900 --> 03:54:11.196
Because the initial LPAC is locally scored, the CDA, along with its contractor, ETS, created a process that we call the rotating score validation process, or affectionately, RSVP.

03:54:12.237 --> 03:54:16.340
process, though we expect all yeses when we do that.

03:54:17.521 --> 03:54:30.109
So as part of that process, what we do is we collect item statistics that we use to produce our technical reports for this assessment, as well as to inform the future development of the test.

03:54:31.576 --> 03:54:38.322
So to complete this process, what we have done is we have sampled districts.

03:54:38.643 --> 03:54:40.044
So in 2018-19, it's about 25%.

03:54:40.104 --> 03:54:41.485
And the sample looks at the initial LPAC.

03:54:49.372 --> 03:54:59.599
And we collect the answer booklets from those districts and have our contractor produce a score for that sample of districts.

03:55:00.279 --> 03:55:05.942
That then allows us to compare the local score with a contractor produced score.

03:55:06.923 --> 03:55:10.804
We then have that comparison report that we can provide to our districts.

03:55:10.844 --> 03:55:20.806
So our districts can reflect on how their local training is doing in terms of their test administrators and their scores that they have administering the LPAT.

03:55:24.347 --> 03:55:33.068
And we had approximately 36,000 answer booklets that were scored by ETS as part of this process in November and December. 36,000.

03:55:37.589 --> 03:55:52.732
And as part of that, there was over a 99% agreement rate of the English language acquisition status between the LEA locally scored and the ETS scores that were produced.

03:55:53.072 --> 03:55:54.832
So that's pretty impressive, I think.

03:55:55.892 --> 03:56:00.513
So for the less than 1% of students, that did have a discrepancy.

03:56:00.713 --> 03:56:04.294
We have been reaching out to those districts and having conversations with them.

03:56:05.394 --> 03:56:12.719
And for most cases, it is because of local data entry errors that are occurring.

03:56:13.399 --> 03:56:21.264
These are not, for the most part, because of errors in terms of scoring, but more on the data entry.

03:56:21.745 --> 03:56:30.951
So what we have done, as well as CDE, as well as our contractor, is ensure that we have provided our districts with information on how they can correct

03:56:31.511 --> 03:56:37.257
that English language acquisition status for anyone for which they did have a data entry error.

03:56:37.758 --> 03:56:43.864
So we have provided that information to them and we continue to walk them through that process if they need assistance in doing so.

03:56:47.941 --> 03:56:51.224
So we'll continue to have this RSVP process moving forward.

03:56:51.244 --> 03:56:54.287
We'll continue to collect samples every year.

03:56:54.307 --> 03:57:01.333
I don't know that we will necessarily need a 25 percent sample every year, but we'll continue to collect samples every year.

03:57:01.413 --> 03:57:03.035
It's important for us to do so.

03:57:04.076 --> 03:57:09.641
Important that we're not seeing drifts or changes in that agreement rate that we saw for this first time out.

03:57:11.835 --> 03:57:17.099
Additionally, ETS is also conducting an initial LPAC threshold score review study.

03:57:17.279 --> 03:57:19.541
I've mentioned this to you before.

03:57:20.842 --> 03:57:32.351
In that process, teachers are being surveyed about the English proficiency of their English learners, as well as the English proficiency of their initial fluent English proficient students.

03:57:33.872 --> 03:57:40.117
The results will be compared to those students' English initial LPAC score results.

03:57:41.400 --> 03:57:46.945
So in other words, teachers professional judgments versus the actual score on the initial LPAC.

03:57:47.846 --> 03:57:59.477
The results will provide information to the department to determine whether or not we will bring forward to this board any recommended changes in those special scores which the board originally adopted.

03:58:00.358 --> 03:58:04.962
If changes are needed and recommended by the department, we will bring those to you in March.

03:58:08.487 --> 03:58:21.012
Also, as part of my update on the LPAC, I do want to also take this time to remind you that we will be having the final administration of the summative LPAC as a paper-pencil test.

03:58:21.632 --> 03:58:29.656
That final administration of the LPAC as a paper-pencil test will open on February 1 and close on May 31st.

03:58:31.296 --> 03:58:36.579
The first administration of the computer-based summative LPAC will begin in spring 2020.

03:58:39.452 --> 03:58:55.182
In May of 2019, you will see me once again, and I will bring forward to this board a high-level test design for that transition to a computer-based assessment for the Summit of LPAC for your review and approval.

03:58:57.204 --> 03:59:04.909
So that concludes my update on LPAC, and I'd like to now transition to a short update on the CASP, Summit of Assessments.

03:59:05.549 --> 03:59:06.550
I'll start off with science.

03:59:07.910 --> 03:59:16.035
So, excited to announce that the first operational CAS administration cycle launched on January 8th.

03:59:16.716 --> 03:59:18.096
So, the window's open.

03:59:19.377 --> 03:59:24.941
The CDE is collecting additional information from students at the end of the assessment.

03:59:25.321 --> 03:59:32.886
I'd like to share with you the questions that were drafted by our independent evaluator for our CAS program, who is Hemro.

03:59:34.166 --> 03:59:52.471
I hope that you agree that the survey questions that we will be asking our students who are taking our tests are going to really provide us some information about whether or not they are provided with an opportunity to learn the content that is being assessed on our test.

03:59:53.571 --> 03:59:59.313
So the three questions include, one, did you learn about the topics on the test in your science class?

04:00:00.717 --> 04:00:07.741
We will also ask students, were any questions on the test different from the types of questions that you see in your science class?

04:00:09.102 --> 04:00:15.146
And then lastly, how hard were questions on this test compared to questions you see in your science class?

04:00:17.825 --> 04:00:28.988
I expect that as we move forward with our implementation of the California Next Generation Science Standards, I hope and expect that the answers to those questions by our students will change over time.

04:00:29.588 --> 04:00:42.971
So while we may not expect as much agreement to those questions at first, hopefully as the opportunity to learn these new standards and the implementation of those new standards increase, we will see changes in the responses by our students to those questions.

04:00:44.011 --> 04:00:53.554
This is not the first time the department has asked students about the content of a test related to what they're receiving in the classroom.

04:00:53.594 --> 04:00:57.535
We did take a similar approach when we had an exit exam in California.

04:00:58.095 --> 04:01:04.777
So we thought it was appropriate to do so as we are thinking about the implementation of these standards.

04:01:05.993 --> 04:01:13.317
In terms of the science test, I know I have talked to you often about the accessible periodic table that we've been developing.

04:01:13.357 --> 04:01:16.438
It took a little longer than I would have liked, but it is now up.

04:01:16.758 --> 04:01:23.942
So that means that we have a periodic table available for teachers to use that a screen reader such as JAWS can read.

04:01:24.902 --> 04:01:26.203
We're excited to announce that.

04:01:26.223 --> 04:01:33.347
We're excited to share that with our teachers for use in the classroom that will also be used on our test.

04:01:34.527 --> 04:01:44.310
I think it just goes to show examples of how our assessment system can be used to assist our teachers outside of that summative window.

04:01:45.950 --> 04:01:56.213
We also are pleased to announce that we will be sharing a periodic table as well as reference sheets for our science tests.

04:01:57.313 --> 04:01:59.855
that can be embossed by our local school districts.

04:02:00.316 --> 04:02:03.719
So that is another way of supporting our students with visual impairments.

04:02:04.300 --> 04:02:14.029
So we also have that available and we will be working with my peers here in the department to ensure that we make sure that our teachers are aware of those resources.

04:02:14.889 --> 04:02:21.856
All of those things are available on the casp.org website outside of any kind of secure login process.

04:02:23.377 --> 04:02:29.220
I also want to share with you that we continue to involve our California science educators in the development of our science tasks.

04:02:30.080 --> 04:02:38.984
Upcoming activities in which we are involving our science educators include, we have a cast item writing workshop later this month.

04:02:39.525 --> 04:02:43.206
We have achievement level descriptors that we'll be developing in March.

04:02:43.827 --> 04:02:46.528
And then we also have an item review workshop in April.

04:02:47.569 --> 04:02:56.237
And so luckily our California teachers continue to volunteer to participate in these activities and we're happy that they do so.

04:02:57.999 --> 04:03:03.985
Along with the CAST, we are also developing the California Alternate Assessment for Science.

04:03:05.246 --> 04:03:08.349
That field test also launched on January 8th.

04:03:10.712 --> 04:03:21.340
To support the field test, our contractor ETS conducted a webinar for our district coordinators, our school site coordinators, and our test examiners, and we did that in December.

04:03:22.121 --> 04:03:28.146
The webcast provided an overview of the administration of the assessment and focused on things such as scheduling,

04:03:29.206 --> 04:03:33.691
changes in the test from the prior year, and key resources for successful testing.

04:03:33.711 --> 04:03:44.962
So we've continued to improve this test and modify it each year as we've gone through the pilot phase and as we now enter this field test phase of that particular assessment.

04:03:46.363 --> 04:03:57.332
In spring, teachers will participate in an item review workshop for the California Alternate Assessment for Science to prepare ourselves for the first operational assessment that will begin in September 2019.

04:03:58.733 --> 04:04:05.059
Now on to the next one, which is the California Spanish Assessment.

04:04:06.472 --> 04:04:17.283
We continue our development activities for that particular assessment and we are preparing for the first administration operationally for that test this spring.

04:04:18.164 --> 04:04:24.190
To a review of the field test data was conducted by teachers as well as department staff.

04:04:24.970 --> 04:04:32.460
During that review, we were able to confirm that we had enough high quality items available to meet that spring off state.

04:04:32.560 --> 04:04:39.970
So we are ready to meet the deadline that we committed to this board for that particular assessment.

04:04:41.457 --> 04:04:46.360
I just want to also take this time to remind you that the Spanish assessment is an optional test.

04:04:47.321 --> 04:04:52.023
It does measure a student's Spanish reading, writing mechanics, and listening skills.

04:04:52.864 --> 04:05:02.810
I also want to take this time to let you know that as we transitioned our primary language test from a paper-pencil version to a computer-based version,

04:05:03.450 --> 04:05:09.753
We are now able to offer that optional test at no charge to our districts.

04:05:10.213 --> 04:05:22.039
So whether or not a student is an English learner or whether or not it is an English only student who happens to be taking in a dual program, for example, they will also receive that test at no cost.

04:05:22.919 --> 04:05:30.303
We were able to negotiate with ETS that there is no additional fee for California for those additional administrations.

04:05:30.903 --> 04:05:36.111
And because there is no additional fee, there is no cost to pass on to our districts.

04:05:36.132 --> 04:05:42.001
So that is a big win for us as we moved from a paper-pencil test to a computer-based test.

04:05:49.614 --> 04:05:50.335
Okay, go ahead.

04:05:50.375 --> 04:05:53.397
Yeah, this is a mega item, so it may get lost, right?

04:05:54.638 --> 04:05:55.259
Yes, thank you.

04:05:55.999 --> 04:06:12.894
So the $5 that are cited here for EL students taking the California Spanish assessment, is that because we are looking at a paper pencil assessment this year, but moving forward, we wouldn't be reimbursing districts?

04:06:13.967 --> 04:06:20.050
So I think you're referring to the apportionment, which is a different, which I will be talking about next.

04:06:20.070 --> 04:06:34.857
So just to be clear, in the past, districts who elected to test students who were not English learners had to pay our contractor a fee because the law prohibits us, the state, from paying for those administrations.

04:06:35.738 --> 04:06:40.040
We are no longer given a cost for those administrations, so there's no fee.

04:06:40.820 --> 04:06:48.005
And so we, in conversations, I had a conversation with Californians Together two days ago, I believe.

04:06:48.786 --> 04:06:50.507
No, yesterday, two days ago.

04:06:50.527 --> 04:07:00.714
And it does seem like even though we have tried to make that clear and communicate that, we obviously have not gotten that piece of information out to everyone.

04:07:00.854 --> 04:07:05.877
So I'm very hopeful that Californians Together and CABE will help us with that message.

04:07:06.057 --> 04:07:08.179
And while I haven't had a chance to

04:07:08.519 --> 04:07:10.680
communicate with Martha, who I see right there.

04:07:10.740 --> 04:07:12.081
Oh, and Shelly.

04:07:12.961 --> 04:07:23.926
I'm going to write a blurb for them, and hopefully they will be so nice to share that out on their listserv so that we can make sure that our educators are aware that there is no cost.

04:07:24.467 --> 04:07:26.208
And so we'll be doing that.

04:07:26.288 --> 04:07:30.029
And I know my friends back there will be happy to send that out for me.

04:07:31.530 --> 04:07:31.710
Yes.

04:07:32.951 --> 04:07:34.572
Not to put you on the spot, but I did.

04:07:34.932 --> 04:07:35.032
OK.

04:07:36.283 --> 04:07:37.644
So now on to apportionment rates.

04:07:37.884 --> 04:07:41.926
And Feliz, I hope this clarifies your question as I talk about the apportionment rates.

04:07:42.746 --> 04:07:50.410
So the CDE asked the state board to approve apportionment rates for tests administered as part of the CASP system during the 18-19 school year.

04:07:51.070 --> 04:08:01.376
State law requires the board to annually establish LEA apportionment rates for each CASP test administered and take into account changes to LEA test administration activities.

04:08:02.156 --> 04:08:11.085
This might include activities such as the number and type of tests administered, changes in computerized test registration, or changes to administration procedures.

04:08:14.082 --> 04:08:26.473
Previously, LEAs received a single apportionment of $4 for each pupil administered any portion of the ELA, math, or science summative CASP.

04:08:27.294 --> 04:08:34.200
So this would include the Smarter Balanced Assessment for ELA and math and or the California Science Test.

04:08:35.711 --> 04:08:41.855
This year's recommendation of apportionment rates differ from last year's rates in three different ways.

04:08:42.816 --> 04:08:45.437
The first difference is the apportionment for CAST.

04:08:45.938 --> 04:08:52.041
We recommend an apportionment for the science test in addition to the apportionment for ELA and MATH.

04:08:52.842 --> 04:09:05.170
We specifically recommend a $2 apportionment rate for each science test administered by an LEA while maintaining the $4 per test administered rate for ELA and MATH.

04:09:06.440 --> 04:09:16.040
As a reminder, administration of CAS takes on average two hours, while administration of the ELA and MAF together takes an average of six and a half hours.

04:09:18.376 --> 04:09:21.357
The second difference is for the California alternate assessments.

04:09:21.937 --> 04:09:29.561
We recommend an apportionment for the CAA for science in addition to the apportionment for the ELA and math alternate assessment.

04:09:30.201 --> 04:09:37.184
Specifically, we recommend a $5 apportionment rate for each CAA for science test administered by an LEA.

04:09:38.104 --> 04:09:54.415
Our rationale for this recommendation is that the alternate assessment for science consists of three embedded performance tasks which are administered one-on-one after the student receives instruction in specific content areas throughout the school year.

04:09:56.977 --> 04:10:01.539
This requires the administration of each performance task in three separate occasions.

04:10:02.499 --> 04:10:09.902
The CDE also recommends the board keep the current apportionment rate for the CAA for ELA and math at the $5 per pupil rate.

04:10:12.711 --> 04:10:21.759
The third and last difference is to further clarify the apportionment language regarding the $1 apportionment to LEAs for students who did not test.

04:10:22.520 --> 04:10:30.507
This apportionment is currently provided to LEAs for the preparation and submission of required electronic test registration information.

04:10:31.428 --> 04:10:45.796
We recommend that we clarify that LEAs receive this apportionment specifically for pupils who tested who were not tested due to either significant medical emergencies or parent-guardian exemptions.

04:10:46.316 --> 04:10:58.122
Both are allowable reasons for not administering the CASP assessment, but they still do, both of those reasons, require LEAs to document those occurrences and provide that as part of the registration system.

04:11:00.483 --> 04:11:02.924
Finally, just a couple of reminders.

04:11:02.964 --> 04:11:11.067
These apportionments for the 2018-19 administration are not distributed until the 2019-20 school year.

04:11:12.387 --> 04:11:20.710
These funds are unrestricted and the apportionment language or the apportionment is subject to allocation of funds in the 2019-20 state budget.

04:11:24.699 --> 04:11:25.800
Okay, thank you.

04:11:26.521 --> 04:11:31.385
Our lunch is here, and I think we ought to take a break and get our lunch for 10 minutes.

04:11:31.425 --> 04:11:40.513
Before we do that, I wanted to announce that John Oswald is in the audience at ETS, and he is retiring from ETS.

04:11:41.014 --> 04:11:42.836
This will be the last meeting.

04:11:42.896 --> 04:11:44.417
He will grace our presence.

04:11:45.718 --> 04:11:55.729
John has been the vice president of ETS and the lead and cognizant officer at ETS overseeing our K-12 assessment contract since 2002.

04:11:55.850 --> 04:12:05.601
The amount of money that we've had in this contract, still trying to ascertain, but it's in the hundreds and millions, hundreds.

04:12:06.662 --> 04:12:09.984
and it deserved and we're happy with their performance.

04:12:10.965 --> 04:12:26.458
In the last 17 years, John has proved to be an ally and a good advisor to the board, thought partner in supporting the state in its upgrading and goal of providing high quality assessments.

04:12:28.020 --> 04:12:33.283
Before joining ETS, John worked for 30 years at testing and educational publishing.

04:12:33.303 --> 04:12:43.890
He's worked in test development, psychometric research, sales marketing, customer service, information technology, operations and general management.

04:12:43.910 --> 04:12:45.991
He also takes out the trash, I understand.

04:12:47.372 --> 04:12:52.155
He is widely acknowledged across the industry as one of the great experts in this field.

04:12:52.656 --> 04:12:55.998
We will miss him and, John, the best to you in this retirement.

04:12:56.179 --> 04:12:57.208
Can we get him to stand up?

04:13:07.003 --> 04:13:09.405
And are we going on to lunch?

04:13:09.425 --> 04:13:14.468
Yeah, we're going to take a break till five after one to get our lunch and continue.

04:13:14.608 --> 04:13:23.975
OK, and before we do that, I just want to thank Michelle Center for her leadership and really excellent work on the California science test.

04:13:24.035 --> 04:13:26.117
I really appreciate you and the work you've done.

04:13:26.497 --> 04:13:27.337
Yeah, we're not done.

04:13:28.478 --> 04:13:29.959
That was her presentation.

04:13:30.019 --> 04:13:31.420
Yeah.

04:13:32.201 --> 04:13:36.024
Yeah, we will have public comment, and we have to act on the apportionment rates.

04:13:43.902 --> 04:13:55.026
Okay, the board will reconvene and we've now completed the presentation on the item, which is item 7.

04:13:56.407 --> 04:14:03.149
And so we're now ready for technical questions or we could go directly to public comment.

04:14:04.030 --> 04:14:04.490
The only

04:14:12.538 --> 04:14:14.622
Okay, yeah, we'll move to public comment.

04:14:15.724 --> 04:14:19.190
Would the following speakers please line up for item eight at the podium?

04:14:21.133 --> 04:14:25.241
Dr. Marlene Batista, Liz Guillen, Brian Revis, Shelly Spiegel-Coleman.

04:14:36.954 --> 04:14:37.394
Good morning.

04:14:38.095 --> 04:14:40.416
My name is Dr. Marlene Batiste, and I'm representing CABE.

04:14:40.756 --> 04:14:48.440
I wanted to express CABE's concern on the proposal to only reimburse the ELEA's administrative fees for English learners taking the California Spanish assessment.

04:14:48.900 --> 04:15:04.609
If our goal as a state is to increase biliteracy, we need to ensure that these programs are providing high levels of biliteracy for all students enrolled, and this can only be done by providing an assessment that informs instructional practices and, as a result, increases learning for these students and encouraging districts to give the test.

04:15:05.109 --> 04:15:10.850
According to the CD, the California Spanish assessment was designed and targeted for students receiving Spanish instruction.

04:15:11.510 --> 04:15:16.051
Therefore, it makes no sense that districts be reimbursed for administration costs only for ELs taking the test.

04:15:16.432 --> 04:15:31.275
This will discourage some districts from testing any and all students enrolled in bioliteracy programs, inclusive of RFEPs and EOs, to ensure that programs are focusing on developing literacy and Spanish at deeper levels and inform those districts on the success of their programs using a valid and reliable tool.

04:15:31.815 --> 04:15:42.204
We urge the board to include funding for administrative costs for all students eligible to take the CSA and encourage districts to demonstrate linguistic and academic proficiencies in English and Spanish.

04:15:42.324 --> 04:15:42.664
Thank you.

04:15:47.908 --> 04:15:48.128
Okay.

04:15:48.248 --> 04:15:51.331
Member Burr, there's some more public comment though.

04:15:55.503 --> 04:15:55.983
Good morning.

04:15:56.043 --> 04:15:58.586
Shelly Spiegel Coleman from Californians Together.

04:15:58.926 --> 04:16:04.731
And we first want to say we really do appreciate meeting with Michelle and her staff on all of these issues.

04:16:04.791 --> 04:16:11.337
She's always very open to having us talk ahead of time and trying to sort out the issues, so on and so forth.

04:16:12.578 --> 04:16:15.200
But with this, with the CSAs, you heard from

04:16:16.241 --> 04:16:28.705
Marlene Bautista, we also are concerned because districts really are incentivized by whether they get supported for the assessments that they are delivering in their districts.

04:16:29.285 --> 04:16:42.510
And so if the incentive is just for the apportionment for English learners and the other students are in the program, the cost then for administering and calculating and sending in the results is borne by the districts.

04:16:43.090 --> 04:17:06.312
And so we really think that it may be that in the authorization for the reapportionment that that is not allowed, but we would encourage the board and the department to look towards changing that authorization and having a position that we do want to have a time that we want to have funds for being able to administer the assessment to all students who are eligible for taking the assessment.

04:17:06.613 --> 04:17:06.913
Thank you.

04:17:10.959 --> 04:17:16.523
Okay, that concludes the public comment and so member Burr.

04:17:18.004 --> 04:17:25.729
So I'm going to first just say thank you to the department staff, especially Michelle and all of her folks for a very comprehensive update.

04:17:25.869 --> 04:17:31.253
I think we appreciate having the LPAC information all together because that's part of our testing program.

04:17:32.253 --> 04:17:33.994
I just want to make sure I understand.

04:17:34.014 --> 04:17:39.918
I'm going to let you say it one more time because I think there's a misunderstanding about the California stand or Spanish test.

04:17:41.600 --> 04:17:47.025
about how it's funded and that there is no additional cost to districts for non-EL students.

04:17:47.105 --> 04:17:55.053
But if you'd clarify it one more time and how we might get the word out and then I'd be happy to make a recommendation on the item.

04:17:55.646 --> 04:17:57.527
Happy to clarify this again.

04:17:57.547 --> 04:18:03.451
And I appreciate Shelly Spiegel Coleman's comment about authorization.

04:18:04.071 --> 04:18:21.922
So in the past, our primary language assessment had our English learner students able to access that test at no fee to a district and then charged a fee for students who were not English learners to access that test.

04:18:23.123 --> 04:18:24.584
That has changed.

04:18:24.904 --> 04:18:33.213
So now all of those students who want a measure of their Spanish literacy skills have access to that test at no fee.

04:18:34.074 --> 04:18:44.185
That being said, what has not changed is who we apportion funds to and who this board has authority to set an apportionment rate for.

04:18:45.205 --> 04:18:53.348
The law does specify that we are apportioning funds for the administration of this assessment to English learners.

04:18:53.948 --> 04:19:00.070
And so that is, I think, the rub, and that is why we see the public comments in the letters that you saw.

04:19:06.192 --> 04:19:08.773
I have two questions on the science test.

04:19:10.593 --> 04:19:10.773
One is

04:19:14.858 --> 04:19:31.381
The preliminary results of the field test were included in the information memo, and I'm wondering what your thinking is on those, or if you have a thought that you're willing to share at this point.

04:19:32.964 --> 04:19:45.835
So, as all of our board members know, the distribution of the preliminary indicator results for the field test was not something that we would have elected to do.

04:19:46.276 --> 04:19:49.519
It was something that we were required to do by the U.S.

04:19:49.539 --> 04:19:50.559
Department of Education.

04:19:50.579 --> 04:19:57.866
And we did not think it was appropriate to do so because of the technical qualities of those scores.

04:19:58.266 --> 04:20:04.930
So, I do not put much in terms of effort into trying to analyze those results.

04:20:05.891 --> 04:20:14.656
I can say, based on the data that was provided to you in the information memorandum, that students obviously, many students, found the test difficult.

04:20:15.796 --> 04:20:21.600
that we could say based on the number of items that they were able to answer correctly.

04:20:22.381 --> 04:20:26.824
But we do not have a test that is the same form across all students.

04:20:26.864 --> 04:20:28.225
We have not done standard setting.

04:20:28.545 --> 04:20:36.310
We have not done all that technical work that we need to do in order to really make statements about those results.

04:20:37.591 --> 04:20:42.094
I can tell you that the vast majority of students did participate in the field test.

04:20:42.674 --> 04:20:45.016
And so we did have a nice participation rate.

04:20:45.057 --> 04:20:46.778
So I think that's important for us to know.

04:20:46.798 --> 04:21:01.353
And I think it was an important experience for our students and our schools and our districts to participate in that test and to see what a California NGSS test looks like.

04:21:02.253 --> 04:21:10.978
I believe that was a very important thing that we did when we transitioned for the Common Core, and we offered our Smarter Balanced tests to everyone as a field test.

04:21:11.018 --> 04:21:12.739
I think that really helped with our transition.

04:21:13.259 --> 04:21:16.361
I hope that doing that for the science test does the same thing.

04:21:17.341 --> 04:21:17.741
Thank you.

04:21:17.921 --> 04:21:25.585
And my second question is, I believe you said that there are three survey questions asked of the students on this last test.

04:21:26.306 --> 04:21:43.295
What is it, and if I remember correctly, the questions were something like, they were getting at how well the students thought, were they familiar with those kinds of questions and were they, the kinds of questions they were seeing in their science class.

04:21:43.795 --> 04:21:44.795
What is it that,

04:21:45.916 --> 04:21:51.078
what will be done with that information in terms of what you hope to understand better from the responses?

04:21:51.098 --> 04:21:52.619
Sure.

04:21:52.939 --> 04:21:57.781
That data is being collected upon the request of our independent evaluator, Humro.

04:21:57.881 --> 04:22:03.323
So Humro will be using that as part of their evaluation of our CASP system.

04:22:04.823 --> 04:22:11.966
I can imagine that they may bring up issues related to the opportunity to learn

04:22:12.846 --> 04:22:21.331
given that we are at an early stage of implementing these standards in our classrooms, they may bring up those concerns.

04:22:22.152 --> 04:22:30.017
Again, I'm projecting what I believe those results will say, I could be wrong, but if they do bring up concerns and if our students do express

04:22:30.777 --> 04:22:36.261
that the test does not yet look like what they're receiving in the classroom, they may bring that up.

04:22:36.501 --> 04:22:48.350
And I think that's important for us as we interpret those future results to know that we may still have some room in terms of making improvements on that transition.

04:22:51.883 --> 04:23:10.354
And I would say it's important for everyone who's trying to help the implementation of NGSS, especially to underrepresented minorities, underserved kids, that we focus our efforts and make sure that they're getting access to that instruction, if that's what is indicated or suggested by the results of those surveys.

04:23:11.114 --> 04:23:18.779
We hope that the results provide an incentive and encouragement to move forward with that transition.

04:23:22.551 --> 04:23:22.851
Thank you.

04:23:23.632 --> 04:23:24.754
Board member Valdez.

04:23:27.417 --> 04:23:29.239
So I think it's wonderful that the cost is free.

04:23:29.259 --> 04:23:30.401
So that's just really good news.

04:23:30.701 --> 04:23:35.266
And we appreciate hearing that because we really do need to measure this impact and districts have local measures.

04:23:35.347 --> 04:23:41.294
But to do this comprehensively and to know to make potential future decisions, it would be really nice to have all that robust data.

04:23:41.314 --> 04:23:41.895
So that's great.

04:23:42.715 --> 04:23:49.703
But an important part of the architecture is to wholesale support districts, I think, in the implementation or the opportunities to take the test.

04:23:49.743 --> 04:23:58.632
And so I know it's outside of our realm, but I really would urge us to look at a way that we could eventually get the Spanish test

04:24:02.055 --> 04:24:05.919
Apportionment to all districts because it sends a message if the global initiative is important.

04:24:05.939 --> 04:24:14.328
We should support it on both sides both the taking of the test as well as the apportionment reapportionment if you will back to the districts, that's my recommendation.

04:24:17.011 --> 04:24:18.132
Board member Ortiz-Lacon.

04:24:20.051 --> 04:24:22.833
Yes, and I want to support what board member Valdez just stated.

04:24:22.874 --> 04:24:35.224
I know that as I have a child who's in a dual language program who's not considered an English learner and I want to make sure that we have a good sense of his Spanish proficiency and that his school has an incentive to test him with the new assessment.

04:24:35.785 --> 04:24:38.487
I think when we were reviewing item two with the world language

04:24:39.488 --> 04:24:46.890
world language standards, it really paved an argument for why we should have apportionments for the Spanish assessment.

04:24:47.050 --> 04:24:51.511
And I know that that's beyond our control now because the law has to change.

04:24:52.112 --> 04:24:55.913
And I know that there is a firewall for the state board members, but I don't like walls.

04:24:56.213 --> 04:24:59.093
So I'm going to make a pitch that that has to change in the law.

04:24:59.153 --> 04:25:03.035
And we have a superintendent that has committed, is committed to a dual emergent.

04:25:03.075 --> 04:25:05.595
We have a state board that has passed the EO roadmap.

04:25:05.615 --> 04:25:07.676
So it just makes sense for us to really move in that direction.

04:25:08.036 --> 04:25:08.276
Thank you.

04:25:11.101 --> 04:25:14.383
Okay, we're ready for a motion, I think.

04:25:14.724 --> 04:25:16.385
I move the department's recommendation.

04:25:16.405 --> 04:25:19.387
I'll second.

04:25:19.407 --> 04:25:19.807
Okay, board.

04:25:20.388 --> 04:25:22.149
Any further comments from the board members?

04:25:22.489 --> 04:25:24.391
If not, all those in favor, raise your hand.

04:25:24.411 --> 04:25:26.612
Okay, that carries.

04:25:26.953 --> 04:25:32.917
And so we're on to action item nine on English language proficiency reclassification.

04:25:41.513 --> 04:25:42.636
I'll bring up the PowerPoint.

04:25:46.083 --> 04:25:49.912
Good afternoon President Kirst and esteemed board members.

04:25:58.649 --> 04:26:02.471
I would like to, I have trouble with his last name.

04:26:03.492 --> 04:26:05.193
Just like people have trouble with my last name.

04:26:05.493 --> 04:26:13.639
I do want to start though by, I'm Veronica Aguilar, Director of the English and Arts Support Division, and I want to start with just being grateful to all of you.

04:26:14.179 --> 04:26:26.408
Because in the four years that I've been in this position, this board, especially with the leadership of President Kirst, has really moved the needle towards equity for English learners.

04:26:27.089 --> 04:26:36.216
And I really appreciate the fact of all the items that have been approved, but more so the fact that the board members have been involved in rolling out all those efforts.

04:26:36.916 --> 04:26:42.401
Member Strauss rolled out the ELA-ELD framework, which is the first in the nation to do that.

04:26:43.702 --> 04:26:44.703
leading that forefront.

04:26:45.443 --> 04:26:53.310
Member Ortiz-Lincon served on the EL roadmap and we have an EL policy and a guidance document.

04:26:53.730 --> 04:27:05.881
And Member Valdez was just recently at our Accountability Leadership Institute keynoting and highlighting all the great things that the board has done to move the needle for English learners.

04:27:06.381 --> 04:27:18.028
And then member Rucker as a member of the panel also highlighting all the wonderful work that has been done in partnership between the department and the state board.

04:27:18.068 --> 04:27:22.951
So I really want to thank you because gratefulness brings us happiness too.

04:27:24.132 --> 04:27:25.252
So now to my item.

04:27:25.552 --> 04:27:27.654
This item requires action from the board.

04:27:28.314 --> 04:27:50.779
The California Department of Education asks the board to approve the state superintendent's proposed use of the English language proficiency assessment for California overall performance level 4 as the English language proficiency criterion for reclassification decision-making beginning in the 18-19 summative English language proficiency assessment for California administration.

04:27:51.139 --> 04:27:53.480
And from this point forward I'm going to mention it as LPAC.

04:27:58.482 --> 04:28:06.497
So education code 313B requires the board to approve procedures for reclassifying pupils from English learners to English proficient status.

04:28:06.858 --> 04:28:08.321
That's why I'm here in front of you.

04:28:09.901 --> 04:28:15.624
I want to clarify that this recommended policy change will not affect the remaining reclassification criteria.

04:28:16.104 --> 04:28:23.828
As you know, there are four criteria for reclassification in law, of which the English language proficiency criterion is one.

04:28:24.588 --> 04:28:27.570
And that is the one that we're addressing today.

04:28:28.350 --> 04:28:32.152
The law remains unchanged and are displayed on this slide.

04:28:34.884 --> 04:28:44.075
In November of 2018, the Assessment Development Administration Division presented two studies related to cut scores using the first operational LPAC scores.

04:28:44.515 --> 04:28:51.864
These studies indicated that threshold scores should be increased for most grades and modified from grade spans to grade levels.

04:28:53.233 --> 04:28:54.294
in grades K-8.

04:28:54.754 --> 04:29:05.178
Based on these studies, the State Board approved the 2018-19 summative LPAC threshold scores by grade level for K-8 and by grade spans for 9, 10, and 11, 12.

04:29:05.558 --> 04:29:15.763
The 2018-19 threshold scores will be implemented beginning with the summative LPAC administration from February through May, as Michelle Center just reminded us all.

04:29:18.450 --> 04:29:22.635
So with this approved updated threshold scores, the rigor was increased.

04:29:23.136 --> 04:29:35.711
Therefore, supplemental empirical analysis were conducted using the 18-19 SBA approved scale scores seen here to establish a recommended LPAC reclassification criterion for each grade level.

04:29:39.224 --> 04:29:46.165
The CDE requested the support of the California Comprehensive Center at WestEd to conduct those supplemental analysis.

04:29:46.566 --> 04:29:54.627
Following the completion of the analysis, the CDE consulted with the LPAC Technical Advisory Group, also known as the LPAC TAG.

04:29:54.947 --> 04:30:05.650
The LPAC TAG members recommended the use of overall performance level four as the LPAC criterion for EL reclassification decisions and suggested additional studies to be conducted.

04:30:06.810 --> 04:30:07.730
Evidence items

04:30:11.941 --> 04:30:17.483
Evidence from the updated supplemental analysis supports the recommendation of the CDE and the LPAC tag.

04:30:17.963 --> 04:30:32.790
Now I would like to invite Robert Lincuante, Project Director and Senior Researcher from the California Comprehensive Center at WestEd, who oversaw the supplemental empirical analysis, to come up and present the results of the updated analysis, which are presented to you as attachment one of the item.

04:30:38.837 --> 04:30:39.618
Thank you, Veronica.

04:30:40.119 --> 04:30:45.647
Good afternoon, Board President Kirst, Deputy Superintendent Schweitzer, and board members.

04:30:46.408 --> 04:30:53.958
I'm Robert Lincuante, a Project Director and Senior Researcher at WestEd, today representing a team from the California Comprehensive Center at WestEd.

04:30:54.759 --> 04:30:55.761
As Veronica just noted,

04:30:56.536 --> 04:31:07.361
When you met last November, we presented analyses that supported the recommendation that you unanimously accepted to raise the threshold cut scores on the LPAC test.

04:31:08.142 --> 04:31:14.145
Once that happened, the CDE asked us to update our original analyses and to conduct some additional analyses.

04:31:14.825 --> 04:31:19.552
So once again, I'm gonna briefly walk you through and summarize what we did, why we did it, and what we found.

04:31:20.293 --> 04:31:22.175
Of course, I should advance the slide, that will help.

04:31:23.577 --> 04:31:29.965
So the purpose of these analyses was first to conduct updated and additional analyses to look at

04:31:30.606 --> 04:31:40.353
what was the effect of raising these cut scores, the threshold levels on the LPAC in terms of looking back at the 2018 administration.

04:31:40.953 --> 04:31:44.996
So obviously, with the new cut scores, we can look and see what the effect would be.

04:31:45.036 --> 04:31:51.180
In effect, it's sort of simulating, what would it have been if we'd had those cut scores in place to give us an idea of what we can expect going forward.

04:31:51.820 --> 04:31:55.823
We also wanted to look at how ELLs performed on the Smarter Balanced DLA test

04:31:56.343 --> 04:32:00.528
in relation to how they perform on the LPAC using these new, more rigorous thresholds.

04:32:01.949 --> 04:32:03.571
And so again, let's refresh our memories.

04:32:03.611 --> 04:32:04.412
Why would we do this?

04:32:04.472 --> 04:32:07.194
We're talking about LPAC, why are we talking suddenly about Smarter Balanced?

04:32:07.855 --> 04:32:12.240
Well, again, the idea is to look at available data to give us a sense of

04:32:13.024 --> 04:32:25.570
for a kid that we would identify as being at the English Proficient Performance Standard on LPAC, at whatever level you all decide you want, to have an idea of what the implications are in terms of where they would be performing academically on the content test.

04:32:26.451 --> 04:32:33.114
And so we look to see in particular whether there's an equal likelihood of a student at that English Proficient Performance Standard on LPAC

04:32:34.046 --> 04:32:44.571
performing at grade level, which would be level three on the Smarter Balanced TLA test, and whether they perform comparably to monolingual English-speaking kids or English-only or EO kids.

04:32:45.811 --> 04:32:47.232
We also performed some new analyses.

04:32:47.272 --> 04:32:58.537
So we repeated the analyses that we did the first time around, and we did some new analyses that looked at recent RFEP students, so the reclassified fluent English proficient kids, those that were reclassified in the prior year,

04:33:00.093 --> 04:33:13.602
And the reason why we do that is because they're considered most comparable in terms of their language abilities and recent educational experiences to the kids that, whatever the proficient level we choose on ELPAC, would be the current ELs that we would be judging as proficient.

04:33:14.943 --> 04:33:21.909
We also looked at EO students, English only students, and recent RFEP students who are similarly situated to the current ELs.

04:33:22.450 --> 04:33:29.776
And we do this to consider the effects of factors that are well documented to influence academic performance beyond the English language proficiency of the kids.

04:33:30.436 --> 04:33:32.878
So I'll get a little more into that as we go through the findings.

04:33:36.785 --> 04:33:43.967
So just to clarify once again, we used multiple methods, the same analytical methods that we presented back in November.

04:33:44.428 --> 04:33:52.951
So this included the descriptive box plots which really show graphically how ELs at each given LPAC performance level perform on smarter balance.

04:33:53.451 --> 04:34:00.014
And we also showed for comparison not just the EL students but the RFEP kids and the initially fluent English proficient kids or IFEP students.

04:34:01.094 --> 04:34:08.096
We also did logistic regression, which estimates the likelihood that a kid at any given LPAC level is going to score level three on Smarter Balanced.

04:34:08.176 --> 04:34:27.962
And then we did a decision consistency method, which tries to identify the LPAC level where you're basically maximizing the percentage of agreement, meaning if a kid is proficient on LPAC, they'll also be proficient on the Smarter Balanced test, and minimize, or not, if they're not proficient, they won't be proficient, and minimize the percentage

04:34:29.022 --> 04:34:30.363
of non-agreement between those two.

04:34:30.383 --> 04:34:33.906
So these are all methods that have been used by dozens of states across the country.

04:34:35.387 --> 04:34:39.050
But I also want to emphasize, well, we also looked at some conjunctive rules as we did last time.

04:34:39.070 --> 04:34:45.035
So in other words, not just overall LPAC, but if you looked at the oral and written composite domains as well to see if that makes a difference.

04:34:45.055 --> 04:34:49.278
In other words, a subset of kids within that LPAC overall level four.

04:34:50.379 --> 04:34:57.624
And we did take a look at one of the CAS or Smarter Balanced DLA reading claim areas, which was a request specifically of the LPAC tag.

04:34:58.525 --> 04:35:03.552
So I want to emphasize at this point, again, what I said last time, which is that this isn't a simple algorithmic process.

04:35:03.612 --> 04:35:06.195
It's not plug in the numbers, get an answer, and you're done.

04:35:06.676 --> 04:35:09.239
It's really, there's lots of factors to consider here.

04:35:09.279 --> 04:35:12.743
So this is really one of several inputs for your decision making.

04:35:12.844 --> 04:35:15.867
But it's an important one because it's based on empirical evidence.

04:35:16.708 --> 04:35:20.570
So to our data set, we had the same data set as last time.

04:35:20.990 --> 04:35:28.293
The difference was, so we had, of course, the CASBLA data for all students, grades three through eight and 11, and a very robust data set it was.

04:35:29.674 --> 04:35:31.274
And we had the LPAC assessment data from 2018.

04:35:33.095 --> 04:35:40.100
for all English learners in grades three through eight and 11, but with the difference that we now apply the new threshold scores that you approved in November.

04:35:40.640 --> 04:35:45.904
So when we talked in November, we were looking at the results for kids based on the threshold scores that you had set for 17, 18.

04:35:47.345 --> 04:35:59.453
Now we're coming back and looking with the setting those thresholds at the 18, 19 threshold levels to really sort of see what difference does it make in terms of how many kids reach it and what their performance is on academic content assessments.

04:36:00.193 --> 04:36:01.014
So I hope that's clear.

04:36:03.135 --> 04:36:04.996
You're eating lunch, that's a good sign.

04:36:05.636 --> 04:36:09.658
I'm hungry, so I'm gonna make this fast, because I wanna eat lunch too.

04:36:10.118 --> 04:36:16.821
So our findings were many, just as last time, so I'm gonna try and distill this, because I know we're on a tight schedule today.

04:36:17.661 --> 04:36:24.324
So when we looked at grades three through eight and 11, the kids using the new threshold scores on the LPAC, how many reached level four?

04:36:24.764 --> 04:36:28.926
Which ostensibly is sort of the range of where we want to have the English Proficient kids perform.

04:36:29.634 --> 04:36:35.036
And what we found is about 15.25%, round up to 15.3% of those kids reached level four.

04:36:35.757 --> 04:36:37.657
This is different from the last time.

04:36:38.198 --> 04:36:43.340
Last time using the former threshold cuts that you had provided, it was about 24%.

04:36:43.920 --> 04:36:49.602
So clearly, we're talking about fewer kids attaining level four, right?

04:36:49.622 --> 04:36:51.763
Same set of kids, different threshold level.

04:36:52.083 --> 04:36:55.025
Fewer kids are attaining it because you've made the test more rigorous.

04:36:55.445 --> 04:36:57.746
And that was based on the empirical evidence that we provided.

04:36:58.227 --> 04:37:01.567
as well as the threshold validation study, which is another form of evidence that.

04:37:02.421 --> 04:37:04.122
Patty Barron from ETS provided.

04:37:05.563 --> 04:37:09.926
So really under these threshold scores, the percentage of ELs also varied less.

04:37:10.066 --> 04:37:12.608
Last time you may remember we had quite a variation.

04:37:12.648 --> 04:37:19.392
It varied from 11% at a particular grade level that were at the English Proficient Performance Standard to up to 37%.

04:37:19.992 --> 04:37:26.036
This time with the smoothing out of the cuts and the adjustments that ETS and CDE made, there was much less variation.

04:37:26.056 --> 04:37:26.817
It was about 13.5% to 18%.

04:37:26.857 --> 04:37:27.677
So that's more stable as well.

04:37:31.397 --> 04:37:35.258
So let's get to the performance on CAS BLA or the Smarter Balanced test.

04:37:35.918 --> 04:37:49.503
So with these threshold scores set higher, those students that make level four clearly performed much better on the Smarter Balanced DLA test compared to how they performed under the former cut scores.

04:37:50.903 --> 04:37:52.864
And that was true at every grade level we looked at, 3 through 8 and 11.

04:37:54.244 --> 04:38:07.891
That said, grades three through eight and 11 ELZL PAC level four still didn't demonstrate an equal likelihood of performing at level three on the Smarter Balanced ELA test, nor did they approximate the performance of VO kids on that test.

04:38:08.432 --> 04:38:12.374
For grades three and four, maybe you remember last time it was grade three was sort of the outlier.

04:38:12.734 --> 04:38:15.035
Those kids actually exceeded the performance of VO kids.

04:38:15.775 --> 04:38:20.578
Now with the new threshold scores, we see kids at grades three and four meeting or exceeding those threshold levels.

04:38:23.019 --> 04:38:37.144
So, given that, we, again, as last time, looked at some of the conjunctive minimum rules that we could apply to say, all right, so are there groups of kids within the ILPAC performance level four?

04:38:37.944 --> 04:38:45.147
And if we applied certain rules regarding the oral and written composite domains, would we get different results?

04:38:45.607 --> 04:38:46.307
And indeed we did.

04:38:46.347 --> 04:38:49.288
When we apply the rules, and we tried different ones,

04:38:49.748 --> 04:39:00.617
What we saw was that the proportion of kids that make the equal likelihood of Smarter Balanced ELA Level 3 goes up quite substantially.

04:39:01.157 --> 04:39:06.662
In fact, right through grade 7, it's only grades 8 and 11 where they don't quite mirror what we see with the O kids.

04:39:07.302 --> 04:39:10.044
However, the percentage of kids

04:39:10.985 --> 04:39:14.266
under those conjunctive rules drops substantially as well.

04:39:14.846 --> 04:39:23.268
So whereas before when we applied those rules in the prior performance cuts, we had anywhere from 11 1⁄2 to 12 1⁄2, so down from 24% to 11 1⁄2 to 12 1⁄2% that would make those conjunctive minimum rules.

04:39:23.308 --> 04:39:25.328
Now we are going from about 12 1⁄4% of the kids that are overall level four

04:39:34.830 --> 04:39:46.594
When we apply those minimum conjunctive rules, meaning you need to be at level three on the oral and level three or four on the written, for example, we're seeing it drop to about 6%, 6 to 6.5% depending on the rules.

04:39:47.215 --> 04:39:56.018
So that's something that we really need to consider given that our current reclassification rates in the last few years have hovered between 11% and 14.5%.

04:39:56.058 --> 04:39:59.279
And that's with applying multiple criteria.

04:39:59.599 --> 04:40:01.000
And this is just one criterion.

04:40:01.724 --> 04:40:10.566
So it really gives us pause, because we have to really think, if we're raising the bar that high, what do we have to tolerate in terms of the number of kids that make it versus don't make it?

04:40:11.266 --> 04:40:18.268
So I also want to mention that we looked at the performance of recent RFEP kids.

04:40:18.548 --> 04:40:23.069
So if we look, something must be interesting happening behind me, because I see a lot of eyes looking at me.

04:40:23.089 --> 04:40:23.429
Just looking?

04:40:23.529 --> 04:40:24.509
OK.

04:40:25.550 --> 04:40:28.150
So we looked at the performance of recent RFEP kids.

04:40:28.190 --> 04:40:29.571
Those were reclassified in 16-17.

04:40:31.191 --> 04:40:45.162
And what's interesting is under the new thresholds of yours at level four with no conjunctive rules, the kids that meet level four on LPAC under your new thresholds perform very similarly to the recent RFEP kids.

04:40:45.662 --> 04:40:59.813
And if you think about recent RFEP kids, these are the kids that are most like our current ELs who might be English proficient in terms both of where their language proficiency is, but also in terms of their recent educational experiences.

04:41:00.593 --> 04:41:03.454
So it's very similar to the recent RFEP kids.

04:41:03.615 --> 04:41:09.957
And what we also know is that RFEP kids, the longer their RFEP generally, the higher the performance of those kids.

04:41:10.177 --> 04:41:11.518
And it's a number of reasons for that.

04:41:12.178 --> 04:41:19.021
So the kids met or exceeded the performance at grades three and four at level three.

04:41:19.722 --> 04:41:26.765
And they also performed similarly to the recent RFEPs in terms of meeting the midpoint of performance level two.

04:41:27.782 --> 04:41:37.676
So, now we're talking about ELA, the midpoint of performance level two, because that's actually where a lot of the kids under the new cut scores are landing with an equal likelihood.

04:41:38.017 --> 04:41:40.761
And that's very similar both to the recent RFEP kids.

04:41:41.590 --> 04:41:45.253
And also to EOs when you control for similarly situated kids.

04:41:45.794 --> 04:41:59.806
So when we looked at recent RFEPs and native English-speaking kids or monolingual English-speaking kids who are similarly situated and we used controls that looked at whether they were economically disadvantaged and whether they had special IDA or special ed identification.

04:42:00.286 --> 04:42:03.569
we found it was much more comparable to those EOs as well.

04:42:03.970 --> 04:42:06.412
And it's typically because the EOs were dropping in performance.

04:42:07.193 --> 04:42:11.838
Sometimes the recent RFEPs and EOs that were similarly situated went up relative to that as well.

04:42:12.638 --> 04:42:14.380
So what's the bottom line here?

04:42:14.480 --> 04:42:16.222
So there's, you know, a lot of analyses.

04:42:17.428 --> 04:42:33.922
The bottom line is that with your new cut scores, we feel confident, we see evidence, plenty of evidence, that students at overall performance level four on the LPAC will attain or exceed the equal likelihood of scoring at or above the midpoint of Smarter Balanced level two.

04:42:34.422 --> 04:42:39.507
Okay, and that's very comparable to the recent RFEPs, and it's also comparable to similarly situated EO kids.

04:42:40.247 --> 04:42:44.411
So, you know, the question really here then is, is this sufficient?

04:42:44.451 --> 04:42:45.792
You know, we're aiming for something different.

04:42:46.392 --> 04:42:47.213
Is this sufficient?

04:42:47.293 --> 04:42:52.258
And I think, as I mentioned, it's a complex decision and there's multiple factors that you need to consider.

04:42:52.919 --> 04:42:55.542
And so it's not a simple algorithmic process.

04:42:55.722 --> 04:43:02.109
And I think if you take a balanced approach, you need to look at the proportion that meet the performance standard that you set.

04:43:03.138 --> 04:43:05.441
particularly in light of the fact that there are multiple criteria.

04:43:05.481 --> 04:43:06.782
This is one criterion.

04:43:07.403 --> 04:43:12.889
Kids are going to need to meet others, and any time you add another criterion, you're going to have fewer kids meeting it.

04:43:12.989 --> 04:43:14.531
So you need to keep that effect in mind.

04:43:15.211 --> 04:43:21.899
Secondly, you do want to look at the performance of similarly situated kids, as well as recent RFEP kids, because those are the kids

04:43:22.439 --> 04:43:33.823
that really we can see at that level they have enough linguistic capacity and presumably access to rigorous grade level content instruction to continue to progress linguistically and academically.

04:43:35.204 --> 04:43:43.647
So given all those factors, our team concluded that the evidence warrants the recommendation that the CDE and the LPAC tag made to you.

04:43:43.747 --> 04:43:47.588
So I'll answer any questions that you have at this point or yield back to Veronica.

04:43:56.445 --> 04:43:57.665
Thank you for your presentation.

04:43:58.386 --> 04:44:05.167
So you mentioned that, you know, that you measured everything from grade three to eight and grade 11.

04:44:05.207 --> 04:44:08.228
So how do we know it's going to work for lower grades like K to two?

04:44:08.688 --> 04:44:11.649
Like, is there a way you have done research, even a little sample?

04:44:12.049 --> 04:44:16.211
Because I feel like even though we did it for the upper grades, how do we know it's going to work for like little kids?

04:44:16.531 --> 04:44:17.411
It's a great question.

04:44:18.158 --> 04:44:30.205
And I think you're highlighting a constraint that we had in these methods, because these methods look at the relationship of the English proficiency assessment to the academic content assessment.

04:44:30.665 --> 04:44:34.187
And in the old days when we had CST, we would run grades three through two through 11.

04:44:35.227 --> 04:44:40.532
We had a lot more data for that range, but now we really are constricted to grades three through eight and 11.

04:44:41.372 --> 04:44:48.838
And so the question about the other grades, I'll have you think back to the study that Patty Barron performed from ETS for you.

04:44:50.379 --> 04:44:52.301
where she did look at all the grade spans.

04:44:52.782 --> 04:44:55.885
And that early evidence suggested that the cut score should be raised.

04:44:56.346 --> 04:45:09.521
So we're basically left with an inference that if we're looking at grades 3 through 8 and 11, we have enough that we could extrapolate going sort of down the grades and up the grades as well to say we're in the reasonable ballpark.

04:45:10.089 --> 04:45:22.653
But to that point, I think they're going to be, Veronica will mention another standardized tool that is going to be developed that will be looking at kids' academic uses of language in the classroom, and that will be K through 12.

04:45:23.813 --> 04:45:28.435
And if you think of the other criteria, the other criteria will also be K through 12 as well.

04:45:28.475 --> 04:45:29.295
But thanks for the question.

04:45:29.335 --> 04:45:32.036
It really kind of highlights how far can we go with this.

04:45:32.496 --> 04:45:36.017
But I feel that we have enough to move forward with some confidence.

04:45:38.258 --> 04:45:38.698
Other questions?

04:45:38.878 --> 04:45:39.578
Ortiz Lacombe.

04:45:41.347 --> 04:45:46.431
Yeah, I just want to tell Board Member Cardenas that that was exactly my question during the call.

04:45:46.471 --> 04:45:51.636
And I was reminded, if you look at slide three, there's four criteria points that have to be met.

04:45:52.016 --> 04:45:55.919
And today we're only discussing number one, which is assessed or only voting.

04:45:56.279 --> 04:45:59.862
I believe we are going to look at a parent consultation.

04:45:59.882 --> 04:46:02.404
Oh, no, the teacher observation tool.

04:46:03.465 --> 04:46:11.608
But we're only looking at assessment of language proficiency using an objective assessment instrument, and that starts in grade three, because that's when the LPAC starts.

04:46:11.929 --> 04:46:27.715
But I know that there are some concerns by some about the lower grades, and what is the criteria we're using to make sure that it's not just level four to be reclassified, but that we're actually looking at what mastery are we demonstrating and where.

04:46:28.513 --> 04:46:46.279
The other thing that I would mention is that what we found in grades three and four now gives us some confidence about the test because what we found originally, even with the old cut scores, was that grade three was quite rigorous and that was where the lowest percentage of kids that were ELLs met it.

04:46:46.759 --> 04:46:53.762
So we know that it's quite rigorous at that grade and the rigor has been increased in the early grades as well.

04:46:56.283 --> 04:46:56.523
You ready?

04:46:58.151 --> 04:46:58.991
Board Member Rucker.

04:47:00.452 --> 04:47:01.352
Robert, don't leave yet.

04:47:02.393 --> 04:47:09.516
I have, I want to just, I don't know if it's a question or a comment for what Board Member Cardenas asked you about.

04:47:09.916 --> 04:47:18.720
I'm not really sure I understand how the extrapolation would work in the lower grades for a couple of reasons.

04:47:19.140 --> 04:47:22.062
And so I need you to correct me on what my assumptions are.

04:47:22.702 --> 04:47:37.589
From what I've learned about the English learner roadmap and from what I've learned about the categories of early stages of language acquisition, there's more diversity in those early stages of language acquisition among young learners.

04:47:38.049 --> 04:47:50.375
And so making an extrapolation about where those students are and moving toward proficiency on the standards, I'm not sure we can make that extrapolation because

04:47:50.755 --> 04:47:55.036
you are doing a different type of assessment of those students.

04:47:55.396 --> 04:47:59.176
The assessment emphasizes, this is where I need the correction for me to be made.

04:47:59.657 --> 04:48:10.318
The assessment emphasizes language acquisition before we started, not in the same way that we're looking at academic acquisition.

04:48:10.678 --> 04:48:18.360
So, I'm not sure the extrapolation that you're talking about works the same way for those students as it would in students that are non-tested in grades 9 and 10.

04:48:20.180 --> 04:48:22.081
So I'm a little uncomfortable with that.

04:48:22.141 --> 04:48:34.428
I think that that would be a little misguided to the field to say that for this single item on the reclassification process, that there's an extrapolation that similarly could be made.

04:48:34.869 --> 04:48:49.197
I think that we need to be very careful, not only in the guidance, but in the explanation for teachers, for students in the early grades about the role of what they're preparing the students for as an on-ramp to that assessment in the early grades.

04:48:49.477 --> 04:49:05.915
So, again, I don't know if that's a question I'm asking or a comment I'm attempting to make because I just want to make sure we're real clear to the point about what the purpose of setting this standard is and how it relates to what teachers in the earlier grades should be paying attention to.

04:49:09.002 --> 04:49:11.324
We have to establish the first criteria.

04:49:11.884 --> 04:49:21.891
And so when the conversation shifted to the comparison between the LPAC and Smarter Balanced, that's what the extrapolation came in.

04:49:22.332 --> 04:49:27.215
But we're not extrapolating for the overall performance level four for the LPAC.

04:49:27.235 --> 04:49:30.537
Thank you.

04:49:30.557 --> 04:49:31.278
Board Member Strass.

04:49:32.741 --> 04:49:36.463
This is a question to, I guess, first to Veronica and then maybe to Robert.

04:49:36.823 --> 04:49:44.548
But I know that your plan is to monitor the results as we go forward, and I think particularly as we look at the younger grades.

04:49:45.149 --> 04:49:48.451
I know we have a lot of confidence in what you've been doing with the results that we have now.

04:49:49.091 --> 04:49:57.421
And so I'm just wondering if in fall of 2020, I believe we'll have three years of data at that point, is that right?

04:49:57.841 --> 04:50:03.648
And whether you could come back with an update for us to take a look at the reliability and sort of where we are at that point.

04:50:04.008 --> 04:50:07.810
I think it's part of your regular practice, but I'm just asking to clarify that.

04:50:07.830 --> 04:50:20.555
Yeah, I'm looking at Michelle to confirm the three years, but as you know, when we did the CELT, we brought it to the board first time, and then there was revisions a second time, and then a third time for K-1.

04:50:20.975 --> 04:50:29.038
So, it is always reiterative where it's continuous improvement, making sure that we're looking at the data that we have at the time that we have it.

04:50:29.438 --> 04:50:40.646
but we also need to make the recommendation for the board to actually approve this because we have to move towards a statewide criteria on all the criterias and we're starting with criterion one.

04:50:41.026 --> 04:50:45.630
So that'd be my request then that you put on a fall 2020 an update.

04:50:47.131 --> 04:50:49.152
That would be, Michelle, that only give us two years?

04:50:49.452 --> 04:50:50.173
It'll give us two years.

04:50:50.473 --> 04:50:51.174
Okay.

04:50:51.374 --> 04:51:03.691
As appropriate then, I guess, as you continue to look at the reliability, I appreciate, Veronica, what you're saying about the fact that you do bring it back again, but I think we're interested in the continued monitoring and progress to make sure we get the scores right, cut scores.

04:51:06.570 --> 04:51:12.331
I have a few more slides, but I'm sure you could stay and answer any questions at the end.

04:51:13.391 --> 04:51:15.512
So this is the action that we're proposing.

04:51:16.072 --> 04:51:18.972
And again, just to reiterate, it's just the first criterion.

04:51:19.332 --> 04:51:21.753
We did involve a series of stakeholders.

04:51:21.913 --> 04:51:32.195
After all the analysis were made, the TAG members, as well as Californians Together, CABE, and other stakeholders to make sure that we're bringing you the best recommendation.

04:51:33.743 --> 04:51:43.494
So our next steps is to develop guidance and disseminate information to the field so that they're very clear that the statewide criteria is only the first criteria.

04:51:44.094 --> 04:51:46.597
The other remain locally determined.

04:51:47.358 --> 04:51:48.199
That has not changed.

04:51:50.202 --> 04:51:53.003
But we are working on an observation protocol.

04:51:53.843 --> 04:52:00.986
The legislature did appropriate funding for us to be able to do Ed Code Section 313.3.

04:52:01.426 --> 04:52:10.069
And we will develop and pilot and validate the observation protocol, actually working with teachers, the same teachers that work with the LPAC assessment.

04:52:11.230 --> 04:52:18.600
It will provide an opportunity to standardize a teacher evaluation of a pupil's English language proficiency, which is the second criteria.

04:52:18.920 --> 04:52:27.912
That way, we could have a standardized instrument and ensure that we are looking at students how they're using their language in the classroom in the content areas.

04:52:28.433 --> 04:52:30.955
So we have multiple measures.

04:52:31.476 --> 04:52:36.681
If you recall, at some point, there was regulations that were taking away the ability for states to have multiple measures.

04:52:36.981 --> 04:52:38.623
Those regulations were rescinded.

04:52:39.003 --> 04:52:44.368
So ESSA plan actually has all four components as our reclassification criteria.

04:52:44.809 --> 04:52:53.257
Unless the law changes, we're going to move forward with those four criterions and moving forward to making them standardized one at a time.

04:52:54.301 --> 04:52:56.762
So if you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them.

04:52:57.163 --> 04:53:02.625
I do want to recognize staff here, Elena Fajardo, Sandra Cubarrubias, who worked on this item.

04:53:02.745 --> 04:53:09.809
And of course, all of ELSD, English Learner Support Division, that work very hard on all the items for English learners.

04:53:10.169 --> 04:53:17.253
And to our deputy, Tom Adams, for always supporting all that we do for English learners across the department.

04:53:19.674 --> 04:53:23.296
We have public comment to come, so let's take the public comment.

04:53:25.171 --> 04:53:28.804
Dr. Marlene Batista, Brian Rebus, Shelley Spiegel-Coleman.

04:53:38.117 --> 04:53:38.917
Good afternoon again.

04:53:38.937 --> 04:53:55.125
I'm here again once again representing CABE and we do support the CD's recommendation that the board approve the proposed use of the LPAC overall performance level 4 as the English language proficiency criterion for reclassification decisions beginning with the 2018-19 summit of LPAC administration for grades K-12.

04:53:55.985 --> 04:54:06.358
However, we are very concerned that the students in K through second grade may be reclassified after just one or two years of English instruction without sufficient time to develop high levels of academic fluency.

04:54:06.758 --> 04:54:12.525
Because there are no academic measures to correlate English proficiency with academic achievement on the CAS for these grades,

04:54:12.905 --> 04:54:14.666
no comparison studies were performed.

04:54:14.766 --> 04:54:36.841
So we urge the board to conduct further studies, analysis over the next three years to determine if the grade level percentages of EL scoring level four are consistent and if the current K2 second students, K2 students assessed with the LPAC at level four reach comparable levels of academic performance when they reach grade three to the students in the empirical studies.

04:54:37.122 --> 04:54:37.442
Thank you.

04:54:41.496 --> 04:54:44.439
Good afternoon, Shelly Spiegel-Coleman with Californians Together.

04:54:44.820 --> 04:55:00.638
Just to build upon what Marlene has said, what we would hope would happen is with the yearly updates, for instance, this year's second graders, it would be next year, it would be great to see how did this year's second graders do on the third grade CASP.

04:55:01.118 --> 04:55:06.725
And did they approximate what we found in the empirical studies for the other third graders?

04:55:06.765 --> 04:55:09.868
And the year after, how did the first graders who would move up to there?

04:55:09.908 --> 04:55:12.191
And then three years later, how did the kindergartners?

04:55:12.211 --> 04:55:15.915
So we'd see, is there consistency for the lower grades?

04:55:16.296 --> 04:55:19.019
And then also to look at the percentage of kids in K1 and 2.

04:55:20.580 --> 04:55:24.142
who reached level four to see if that has some consistency.

04:55:24.642 --> 04:55:38.947
So we're hoping that the board would work with the department to do these additional studies, not just an update on the test, but an update on what it means for the lower grades when they get to K-3 and can we make those judgments and feel confident about them.

04:55:39.247 --> 04:55:42.169
We do support the item and hope that you move it forward.

04:55:42.209 --> 04:55:42.969
Thank you very much.

04:55:45.050 --> 04:55:45.770
Board member Rucker.

04:55:49.355 --> 04:56:04.544
I just wanted to say with respect to the comments we just heard from the two representatives from CABE, from the methodologies that Robert explained that were used to do the analysis, some of what they're requesting are things that is doable.

04:56:05.704 --> 04:56:14.830
But again, as it relates to some of the work you're asking for to look at an analysis for the early grades, that's a little outside of what we have.

04:56:15.430 --> 04:56:19.433
I'm not going to say the capacity for, but the data set to take a look at.

04:56:19.754 --> 04:56:29.201
But some of the comparability information they're asking for, that's kind of already included or even available with some of the methodologies that you already explained.

04:56:29.241 --> 04:56:29.922
Isn't that correct?

04:56:30.222 --> 04:56:36.828
Yes, but I do think it's worth emphasizing, which the first two public speakers did, and I think they're absolutely right.

04:56:37.188 --> 04:56:40.511
This needs to be an ongoing, this is really how you ensure ongoing validation.

04:56:41.271 --> 04:56:56.067
The assessment and so or the uses of the assessment based on the policy decision you make so yes I think what they've suggested is exactly what the department would be doing And then as Veronica mentioned, there's multiple criteria that will need to be in place.

04:56:56.808 --> 04:56:57.048
Okay.

04:56:57.168 --> 04:57:03.655
Thank you We have one more person who would like to make a public comment

04:57:11.380 --> 04:57:14.402
Hello, I'm Angela DeRamos and I'm actually speaking for myself.

04:57:15.122 --> 04:57:20.206
As a classroom teacher, I just kind of wanted to give you a little bit of the reality of what this looks like from the ground.

04:57:21.166 --> 04:57:30.633
What it ends up translating to often isn't an increase in pedagogy or discussion around the servicing of children to acquire language.

04:57:31.013 --> 04:57:35.756
What it does result in is an increase in PD for teachers around test prep.

04:57:36.677 --> 04:57:39.819
I know because that's happened to me this year already twice.

04:57:40.479 --> 04:57:47.442
So all our energy and resources are being spent on test prep because of the culture that we've come from.

04:57:47.922 --> 04:57:59.306
So I just want for you to be aware and I really appreciate the call out for alternative metrics and other ways of assessing children besides a number.

04:57:59.586 --> 04:57:59.866
Thanks.

04:58:02.607 --> 04:58:04.228
Any other board member comment?

04:58:04.308 --> 04:58:06.589
I think we, Ortiz-Lacombe.

04:58:07.748 --> 04:58:09.889
I'm also happy to make a motion since we are the liaison.

04:58:10.290 --> 04:58:14.712
But I just want to support what board member Rucker said.

04:58:15.053 --> 04:58:19.556
And I think that there is an agreement that we need to continue learning, monitoring the data.

04:58:19.576 --> 04:58:25.339
I know that there's so much data that we'll collect and sometimes we just have to get to the next thing.

04:58:25.399 --> 04:58:32.764
But one of my biggest concerns as we're talking not only about the LPAC, but just the diversity within our different typologies of ELs,

04:58:33.144 --> 04:58:38.769
is that we have a language, a linguistic gap that happens and it's measured widely through the LPAC.

04:58:38.789 --> 04:58:50.619
If you look at how Spanish-speaking students perform when compared to other languages, I don't know why that is, you know, especially when you think of California where primary language support is so much more available.

04:58:52.180 --> 04:59:00.164
to Spanish-speaking students, and yet they are the ones that are not performing at the same level as students that speak other languages.

04:59:00.464 --> 04:59:07.468
So I would be interested in us digging a little bit more and looking at not only the achievement gap, but the language gap that we're also observing.

04:59:07.808 --> 04:59:13.856
And I know that's not related to this item, but I think that there's so much more that we need to dig that data.

04:59:13.916 --> 04:59:17.661
We need to do some real major dives because that will eventually show.

04:59:17.941 --> 04:59:22.087
And we see that language difference in the achievement gap that we see in letter grades.

04:59:22.788 --> 04:59:25.752
But with that, I want to move the department's recommendation.

04:59:26.877 --> 04:59:27.698
That's all I have to say, right?

04:59:29.038 --> 04:59:30.219
I will second that.

04:59:30.639 --> 04:59:31.520
I will second that.

04:59:31.600 --> 04:59:34.822
And I also want to draw attention to what Angela Duramo said.

04:59:35.222 --> 04:59:39.544
Making this motion does not improve practice at the local level.

04:59:39.945 --> 04:59:50.511
If the focus remains on test preparation to goose the performance of the students on the test score, we have not improved practices concerning reclassification.

04:59:50.591 --> 04:59:54.293
So I'm hoping the conversation and the discussion we're having today

04:59:54.973 --> 05:00:12.871
also includes or at least suggests to the field that teachers need support and professional development that's focused on paying attention to the linguistic gap that the assessment data is actually showing very clearly to them so that the teachers get the help that Angela pointed out they actually need.

05:00:13.311 --> 05:00:20.233
not improvement on how to give the assessment, but improvement on how to use the assessment results to actually inform their instruction.

05:00:20.273 --> 05:00:26.796
So, I want to really thank her for coming and making, being very brave and making that statement to us because we should be aware of that.

05:00:29.176 --> 05:00:30.997
Valdes, board member Valdes.

05:00:32.231 --> 05:00:39.959
And along with what Member Rucker just said, practice will change when you have good data.

05:00:40.079 --> 05:00:46.065
And so that ongoing validation will really change the behavior and change the priority of how we spend time with teachers.

05:00:46.125 --> 05:00:46.686
So thank you.

05:00:47.777 --> 05:00:55.003
And just to remind everyone, teachers were involved in setting the standards for the LPAC.

05:00:55.524 --> 05:00:57.606
And so teacher judgment is being built in.

05:00:58.146 --> 05:01:01.309
And with the observation protocol, teachers will be built in as well.

05:01:01.409 --> 05:01:03.091
And I think that's how we change the practice.

05:01:03.311 --> 05:01:05.213
And so we are working towards the same goal.

05:01:07.796 --> 05:01:09.216
Okay, I think we're ready for a vote.

05:01:09.397 --> 05:01:11.337
All those in favor of the motion, raise your hands.

05:01:11.657 --> 05:01:12.618
All right, that carries.

05:01:13.278 --> 05:01:13.678
Thank you.

05:01:14.658 --> 05:01:25.822
Because we're going to have very large signups for the item 10, I'd like to move that we take up the waivers and the proposed consent and get those voting actions out of the way.

05:01:26.502 --> 05:01:29.023
So let me take up first the waivers.

05:01:32.284 --> 05:01:34.305
Karen Valdez will recuse.

05:01:37.069 --> 05:01:42.731
And so do we have a, do we have any discussion?

05:01:42.751 --> 05:01:46.693
Is there any public comment on the waivers?

05:01:49.414 --> 05:01:50.054
Yes or no?

05:01:50.394 --> 05:01:50.594
No?

05:01:51.314 --> 05:01:52.855
Is there any public comment on waivers?

05:01:52.995 --> 05:01:54.035
Oh, she went to get the sheet.

05:01:54.395 --> 05:01:54.756
Okay.

05:01:56.696 --> 05:01:58.617
Are there any board comments on the waivers?

05:02:01.536 --> 05:02:04.959
I'll move approval of the waivers if there's not going to be any comment.

05:02:06.320 --> 05:02:08.061
Wait a minute, they can't get in the room.

05:02:08.321 --> 05:02:08.562
Okay.

05:02:35.725 --> 05:02:38.607
Okay, where is she?

05:02:38.848 --> 05:02:39.848
Is she trying to get in?

05:02:39.868 --> 05:02:59.925
Yeah, got it.

05:03:00.545 --> 05:03:02.627
Are there any sign-ups for the waivers?

05:03:05.982 --> 05:03:06.942
None for the waivers.

05:03:07.142 --> 05:03:08.483
One for item 19.

05:03:08.923 --> 05:03:09.243
Okay.

05:03:09.363 --> 05:03:11.344
I'm ready for a motion on the waiver.

05:03:14.405 --> 05:03:14.765
Okay.

05:03:16.705 --> 05:03:18.126
So we have a motion and a second.

05:03:18.186 --> 05:03:21.967
Without any further discussion, let's all raise our hands for support the waivers.

05:03:22.587 --> 05:03:23.347
Okay.

05:03:23.467 --> 05:03:25.128
Now we have proposed consent.

05:03:25.508 --> 05:03:25.948
Go ahead.

05:03:26.188 --> 05:03:27.589
Call or comment.

05:03:28.369 --> 05:03:31.310
For item 19, Shen Coburn.

05:03:33.467 --> 05:03:34.808
Sorry, Sherry Coburn.

05:03:35.128 --> 05:03:37.330
Sharon Coburn.

05:03:38.490 --> 05:03:39.031
Here you come.

05:03:39.051 --> 05:03:48.437
Good afternoon, Dr. Kirst and Tony Thurman.

05:03:48.457 --> 05:03:49.078
I know he's not here.

05:03:49.118 --> 05:03:49.818
I'm Sherry Coburn.

05:03:49.838 --> 05:03:52.260
I'm with the California School Nurses Organization.

05:03:52.320 --> 05:03:53.921
Is this for the vision screening guidelines?

05:03:53.981 --> 05:03:55.142
I just want clarification.

05:03:55.802 --> 05:03:59.965
Yes, we enacted, legislation was enacted back in 2014.

05:04:02.086 --> 05:04:06.329
And we are proposing to move the guidelines forward for vision screening guidelines.

05:04:06.349 --> 05:04:08.531
The last guidelines were adopted in 2004.

05:04:09.031 --> 05:04:24.522
And since that time, there's been technological advancements, evidence-based practice that has emerged with respect to providing services for students that are non-English speaking, non-literate special education students.

05:04:25.543 --> 05:04:28.445
And so we are just grateful for your support

05:04:28.985 --> 05:04:32.626
to open up the regulatory process for public comment on these guidelines.

05:04:33.246 --> 05:04:48.351
It was a broad cross collaborative group that CSNO, California Department of Education, in partnership with CSNO and a grant that CSNO wrote to help fund the revision of the guidelines.

05:04:48.451 --> 05:04:50.011
So thank you so much.

05:04:53.052 --> 05:04:54.233
Okay, we're ready for a motion.

05:04:54.293 --> 05:04:55.013
Ortiz-Lacombe.

05:04:56.920 --> 05:04:58.741
Yes, so that was for item 19.

05:04:59.262 --> 05:05:00.703
I just want to say it was on consent.

05:05:01.143 --> 05:05:03.505
It will be starting the 45-day public comment.

05:05:03.525 --> 05:05:08.449
I'm the liaison and I move the recommendation for the consent items.

05:05:08.609 --> 05:05:09.190
I'll second.

05:05:09.210 --> 05:05:11.191
Okay, Rucker seconds.

05:05:11.812 --> 05:05:13.393
All those in favor, raise your hands.

05:05:13.653 --> 05:05:14.114
Okay.

05:05:15.535 --> 05:05:25.223
Now we go back to item 10, Petition for the Establishment of a Charter School under the Oversight of the State Board, Watsonville Prep School.

05:05:26.149 --> 05:05:33.091
So Lisa Costanzio will present this for the State Department of Education.

05:05:36.913 --> 05:05:37.913
Good afternoon, everyone.

05:05:37.933 --> 05:05:40.574
Can you hear me on this one?

05:05:45.051 --> 05:05:46.792
Okay, good afternoon everyone and happy new year.

05:05:47.512 --> 05:05:49.853
My name is Lisa Constante with the Department of Education.

05:05:49.873 --> 05:05:56.737
I will be here to present item 10, which is a petition before you for the establishment of Watsonville Prep School.

05:05:59.071 --> 05:06:07.179
On May 23rd, 2018, Pajaro Valley Unified School District voted to deny the Watsonville Prep School by a vote of 5 to 0.

05:06:07.819 --> 05:06:16.107
On August 16th of 2018, the Santa Cruz County Board of Education voted to deny the Watsonville Prep petition by a vote of 4 to 3.

05:06:16.727 --> 05:06:20.351
The petitioner submitted the petition on appeal to the State Board on September 28th, 2018.

05:06:24.127 --> 05:06:37.359
The California Department of Education recommendation is that the State Board hold a public hearing to approve the request to establish Watsonville Prep, a kindergarten through grade 8 charter school under the oversight of the State Board with the following condition.

05:06:38.220 --> 05:06:47.269
The Watsonville Prep Board will provide the CDE with a revised multi-year budget including updated financial projections and a completed narrative and assumptions.

05:06:49.844 --> 05:07:02.513
The recommendation is based on the petition presenting a sound educational program, demonstratively likely to successfully implement the program, and reasonably comprehensive description of most of the charter elements.

05:07:04.994 --> 05:07:08.958
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools met on December 13, 2018.

05:07:09.539 --> 05:07:15.045
The Advisory Commission moved staff's recommendation to approve the petition to the State Board of Education.

05:07:15.645 --> 05:07:21.632
The motion passed unanimously by a vote of eight to zero with one commissioner that was not in attendance.

05:07:24.079 --> 05:07:37.349
Some background on Watsonville Prep, the school intends to eventually serve K-8, so the petition itself is for a K-8 school, but they are going to open gradually and eventually during the five-year term just get to grade six.

05:07:38.090 --> 05:07:44.975
So they're proposing to open in 2019-20, serving kindergarten through grade two, and they're proposing to open with 180 students.

05:07:46.877 --> 05:07:55.267
and to grow a grade level per year up to serving 420 students in kindergarten through grade six by the end of the five-year term 2023-24.

05:07:59.389 --> 05:08:05.172
In terms of the facility, the deadline to submit Prop 39 facility requests to the district was November 1st of 2018.

05:08:05.432 --> 05:08:11.556
The petitioner has requested a school within the City of Watsonville boundaries.

05:08:12.316 --> 05:08:17.359
The school district responded by December 1st, objecting to the average daily attendance projections.

05:08:18.259 --> 05:08:24.946
and the Watsonville Prep School responded to the district prior to January 2, 2019, verifying that accuracy.

05:08:24.986 --> 05:08:29.690
That's the latest information we have in terms of the Prop 39 negotiations.

05:08:30.471 --> 05:08:36.697
Currently, the school has 223 kindergarten through grade two meaningful intent to enroll forms.

05:08:39.440 --> 05:08:47.365
In terms of the educational program, Watsonville Prep plans to locate and serve pupils primarily within the city boundaries of Watsonville.

05:08:48.206 --> 05:08:56.371
Their mission and vision is to equip students to be learners and leaders in high school, college and beyond, as well as improve communities through education.

05:08:57.251 --> 05:09:02.655
The petition describes instructional models for both kindergarten through grade five and grade six through grades eight.

05:09:05.475 --> 05:09:26.026
They also have five key educational elements that will define a pupil's kindergarten through grade eight experience at the school, a strong culture of excellence, data-driven instruction, consistent coaching and feedback for all staff, robust multiple tiers of support for academics and behavior, and state-of-the-art technology to prepare students for the future.

05:09:26.726 --> 05:09:34.430
They also have a focus on achieving and maintaining a racial and ethnic balance among its pupils that is reflective of the general population of the district.

05:09:36.741 --> 05:09:40.583
CDE also reviewed the financial status of the budget.

05:09:41.283 --> 05:09:44.125
And the multi-year financial plan is fiscally viable.

05:09:44.665 --> 05:09:49.848
They did also receive some additional grants that are listed here after we reviewed the budget.

05:09:50.148 --> 05:10:00.554
So we are recommending that the school provide additional updated multi-year plan to us to include these grants so we can see how they will be spread out over the term, over the charter term.

05:10:03.621 --> 05:10:13.684
In terms of other schools that Navigator Schools is operating in California, Navigator Schools operates two other schools, college prep, kindergarten through grades eight.

05:10:14.345 --> 05:10:19.406
Gilroy Prep is authorized by the Gilroy Unified School District in 2010.

05:10:19.887 --> 05:10:22.588
It was renewed by the school district in 2018 for a five-year term.

05:10:24.168 --> 05:10:33.516
Hollister Prep was authorized by the Hollister School District in 2013 and was also renewed by the local district in 2018 for another five-year term.

05:10:34.457 --> 05:10:43.424
The 16 through 18 CASP scores, CASP data in ELA and mathematics for both of these schools have outperformed the district and the county.

05:10:45.967 --> 05:10:54.035
The Navigator K-8 model, as implemented at both of the schools, is designed to prepare Navigator students for the rigors of high school.

05:10:54.636 --> 05:11:07.209
The petition also states that the academic achievements of both of the schools are products of a concentrated effort to create an educational model that can be easily replicated and personalized to meet the needs of the community it's being served.

05:11:09.545 --> 05:11:13.749
If approved by the state board, the following charter elements will need to be clarified by the petitioner.

05:11:14.349 --> 05:11:20.014
We do not consider these to be material, but we do want these to be clarified prior to the opening of the school.

05:11:20.795 --> 05:11:28.882
In terms of measurable pupil outcomes, the petition does not include measurable outcomes for each of the significant subgroups the petitioner proposes to serve.

05:11:29.642 --> 05:11:37.269
And in terms of the annual independent financial audits, they do not specify who's responsible for contracting and overseeing the independent audit.

05:11:39.867 --> 05:11:46.311
In terms of the admission preferences, the petition does present a reasonably comprehensive description of the admission preferences.

05:11:46.911 --> 05:11:52.194
The petition provides a preference for the residents of the district who reside within the city boundaries of Watsonville.

05:11:53.015 --> 05:11:57.858
Based on the petition, initially we couldn't determine the reasoning for this preference.

05:11:57.898 --> 05:12:06.603
They did meet the legal requirements, but at the ACCS meeting, the petitioner stated that the intent was to target socioeconomically disadvantaged students.

05:12:09.426 --> 05:12:20.069
In summary, CDE staff is recommending approval of this petition based on sound educational program, their ability to implement, and the clarification of the charter elements in the petition as needed.

05:12:21.769 --> 05:12:23.930
And I'm here and available to answer any questions that you have.

05:12:24.670 --> 05:12:26.291
Okay, are there any technical questions?

05:12:28.151 --> 05:12:28.751
Hearing none.

05:12:32.492 --> 05:12:36.393
Yeah, just these are technical questions before we open to public hearing.

05:12:37.874 --> 05:12:38.174
Okay.

05:12:39.389 --> 05:12:39.709
All right.

05:12:40.370 --> 05:12:42.232
Then I will open the public hearing.

05:12:43.093 --> 05:12:44.775
Each side has 10 minutes.

05:12:45.456 --> 05:12:54.425
So we'll hear first from the proponents of the charter petition who want to have the petition approved.

05:12:54.465 --> 05:12:55.366
You have 10 minutes.

05:12:55.546 --> 05:12:56.407
Please come forward.

05:13:16.823 --> 05:13:21.366
Good afternoon, President Kirst, honorable board members, Superintendent Thurmond.

05:13:22.026 --> 05:13:23.127
My name is Kevin Sved.

05:13:23.267 --> 05:13:24.768
I'm CEO of Navigator Schools.

05:13:25.308 --> 05:13:34.374
Before I go on, I want to first point out that we have about 100 supporters, parents that drove about four hours from Watsonville today outside.

05:13:35.314 --> 05:13:36.795
And you'll be hearing more from them later.

05:13:37.355 --> 05:13:41.138
But we're very happy to be here and we're very thankful for your time today.

05:13:42.118 --> 05:13:46.922
I wanted to also say that I started my teaching career in 1991 in Los Angeles Unified.

05:13:47.642 --> 05:13:50.625
In 1994, I co-founded the first charter school in South LA.

05:13:51.005 --> 05:14:00.272
And in all my experience serving the public, I've never been part of a team as great and as solid and as committed to student success as Navigator Schools.

05:14:01.638 --> 05:14:05.379
And that's why we have these type of ESPEC results.

05:14:06.160 --> 05:14:09.401
These results demonstrate our students are thriving.

05:14:10.041 --> 05:14:20.064
With a student population that is predominantly low income and Latino, over 85% of our students are proficient in English language arts and more than 70% in math.

05:14:21.625 --> 05:14:25.446
Watsonville parents want these outcomes for their children too.

05:14:26.067 --> 05:14:29.988
And your support today will allow us to achieve these results in the Pajaro Valley.

05:14:30.984 --> 05:14:40.793
Watsonville Prep's founding principal, Andrea Hernandez, will now speak to our work with our parents and talk to you about the model that achieves these outstanding results.

05:14:41.614 --> 05:14:41.734
Andrea.

05:14:44.571 --> 05:14:45.331
Good afternoon.

05:14:46.112 --> 05:14:50.533
As a founding Hollister Prep teacher, it is truly an honor to be here today.

05:14:51.054 --> 05:14:57.876
Before you and in the various rooms are the faces of resilience, determination, and passion.

05:14:58.556 --> 05:15:03.038
These are the faces why we're asking you to open WPS in August 2019.

05:15:05.399 --> 05:15:16.551
This charter appeal is the result of commitment to the community, hundreds of hours of parent involvement, and a proven track record of success at our two current schools.

05:15:17.532 --> 05:15:27.402
Several of our staff members have either lived in Watsonville, attended or worked in local schools, and now want to partner with the parents who have asked for this choice.

05:15:28.820 --> 05:15:43.606
After visiting Gilroy and Hollister Prep Schools, this group of very dedicated parents begin working to bring this school of choice to their hometown for their children and the children of so many others who could not be here today.

05:15:46.127 --> 05:15:49.829
These parents were drawn to Navigator's mission-driven behavior.

05:15:50.429 --> 05:15:54.651
Regardless of circumstances is more than just the last line in our mission.

05:15:55.330 --> 05:15:58.672
It is the how and the why we are closing the achievement gap.

05:15:59.573 --> 05:16:09.939
Navigator exists to provide the most traditionally underserved students with the education foundation they will need to succeed in high school, college, and beyond.

05:16:10.619 --> 05:16:16.163
And Navigator's commitment is why we have over 200 intent to enroll forms.

05:16:18.436 --> 05:16:33.517
These dedicated parents witnessed what Gilroy Unified and Hollister School District saw when they decided to originally partner with Navigator, and then again what they recognized when they unanimously approved both schools for their five-year renewals in 2018.

05:16:35.359 --> 05:16:41.227
These parents experienced why Santa Cruz County staff members recommended approval.

05:16:41.828 --> 05:16:50.881
They saw an effective model which our founders envisioned when they were educators in traditional public school districts such as Gilroy and Pajaro Valley.

05:16:53.143 --> 05:17:05.593
From the moment you walk onto a Navigator campus, you will notice our strong academic performance, our emphasis on continuous improvement, and warm and caring relationships among staff and students alike.

05:17:06.334 --> 05:17:10.177
The first compass point, culture of excellent, drives who we are.

05:17:10.838 --> 05:17:16.542
From day one, Navi founders wanted students to feel special as they strive for success.

05:17:17.643 --> 05:17:25.432
This focus is illustrated by every child, every educator, every staff member never taking good enough as an answer.

05:17:26.053 --> 05:17:29.216
And we appreciate the struggles that come along the way.

05:17:30.197 --> 05:17:35.443
Our perseverance has closed the achievement gap for the most traditionally underserved.

05:17:37.617 --> 05:17:43.380
At the core of Navigator's success is the integration of data in every decision we make.

05:17:44.120 --> 05:17:51.203
Students' academic progress is assessed weekly with modifications made to their personalized programs as needed.

05:17:51.984 --> 05:18:00.668
Being able to know where a student struggles and succeeds enables the instructional staff to address needs immediately through intervention programs.

05:18:02.717 --> 05:18:09.722
Visitors to Navigator and our staff members would all agree, our emphasis on coaching is key to our success.

05:18:10.683 --> 05:18:13.565
Every staff member is coached on a weekly basis.

05:18:14.145 --> 05:18:18.349
Instructors are observed daily with a formal weekly feedback meeting.

05:18:19.049 --> 05:18:22.411
There they receive glows and an action step to be implemented.

05:18:23.272 --> 05:18:29.817
This focus on continuous improvement is why so many of us choose to stay at Navigator year after year.

05:18:32.432 --> 05:18:37.534
Several of Navigator's founding team came with a strong background in special education.

05:18:38.194 --> 05:18:44.697
Watsonville Prep School will be full inclusion, with paraprofessionals pushing into the classroom all day.

05:18:45.517 --> 05:18:53.000
At any given moment, you can walk into a classroom and see two to three adults working with small groups or the whole class.

05:18:56.167 --> 05:19:08.836
Navigator's deliberate use of technology enables the students to both personalize their blended learning, and it also gives them opportunities to take over the iPad and serve as educators and leaders.

05:19:11.300 --> 05:19:15.143
Before I go, I want to share with you a few pictures of my favorite night of the week.

05:19:15.744 --> 05:19:21.169
These pictures in front of you are from our Reading is Fun Club held in Watsonville every Monday night.

05:19:21.969 --> 05:19:30.797
In this incredibly positive environment, parents can see the impact the Navigator model is having on their children in just a short period of time.

05:19:31.517 --> 05:19:39.004
The love and the enthusiasm in the room is just a glimpse of the feelings we'll have when Watsonville opens next fall.

05:19:39.850 --> 05:19:43.816
Kevin will now tell you a little bit more about our students' academic performance.

05:19:44.297 --> 05:19:44.598
Thank you.

05:19:51.340 --> 05:20:03.848
Last year, out of over 1,200 schools in the Bay Area, Innovate Public Schools ranked Gilroy Prep first for low-income Latino students in English Language Arts and Math.

05:20:04.308 --> 05:20:06.229
We are very proud of these results.

05:20:06.369 --> 05:20:08.791
We are closing the achievement gap at Navigator Schools.

05:20:09.371 --> 05:20:17.136
And if Hollister Prep was considered in the same region, Navigator would have had the top two spots in both English Language Arts and Math.

05:20:19.622 --> 05:20:26.110
Now, this success is a result of the hard work of our teachers and hard work of our students like Paola.

05:20:27.017 --> 05:20:28.818
So Paola started with us in second grade.

05:20:28.998 --> 05:20:30.419
She was an English language learner.

05:20:31.099 --> 05:20:33.841
She was soon re-designated fluent English proficient.

05:20:34.161 --> 05:20:38.424
The four years she took SBAC, she scored at proficient or better.

05:20:39.324 --> 05:20:43.167
And her reading comprehension, as you see on this slide, soared.

05:20:43.847 --> 05:20:46.349
And along with that, her confidence did as well.

05:20:46.929 --> 05:20:47.189
Why?

05:20:47.249 --> 05:20:50.171
Because it's opening up doors to new knowledge, to books.

05:20:50.571 --> 05:20:53.713
And that's what Navigator is about, supporting all of our students to move forward.

05:20:54.952 --> 05:20:56.893
And her story is not isolated.

05:20:56.913 --> 05:21:07.057
96% of our students that have been re-designated fluent English proficient scored three or better on last year's ESPEC in English Language Arts.

05:21:07.497 --> 05:21:08.958
That's 178 out of 182 students.

05:21:08.978 --> 05:21:11.179
I'm sorry, 192 out of the 196 students.

05:21:19.523 --> 05:21:25.366
Moving forward here, we are looking here at our migrant students.

05:21:25.426 --> 05:21:36.752
So about 10% of our student population in Hollister are migrant, and their SBAC results are also excellent, 79% of them proficient or advanced in ELA and 75% in math.

05:21:39.373 --> 05:21:42.896
And that's largely due to our strong multi-tiered systems of support.

05:21:43.537 --> 05:21:49.081
And that same multi-tiered systems of support is really serving our students with disabilities very well as well.

05:21:49.221 --> 05:21:56.487
As you can see, our proficiency rates for our students with disabilities is about three times the state average.

05:21:58.962 --> 05:22:02.703
Now this slide really shows what Navigator is about, closing the achievement gap.

05:22:03.004 --> 05:22:07.986
We have virtually eliminated the achievement gap for our English language arts.

05:22:08.386 --> 05:22:14.128
When you look at our students who are disadvantaged economically versus those who are not.

05:22:14.608 --> 05:22:26.633
And if you look at our economically disadvantaged students compared to the state average, our economically disadvantaged students are outperforming state students who are not economically disadvantaged.

05:22:27.233 --> 05:22:36.684
That also holds true for math, that our economically disadvantaged students are outperforming the state students who are not economically disadvantaged.

05:22:37.204 --> 05:22:38.546
We are really proud of that.

05:22:39.287 --> 05:22:48.277
And this strong academic foundation is allowing us to really support our students as they proceed into the upper grades to become learners and leaders.

05:22:49.405 --> 05:22:56.992
You'll see here in the picture that we have students out in front teaching, and that happens quite frequently in the upper grades.

05:23:01.115 --> 05:23:15.087
And it's also important to remember that all those numbers and all that data represents real children, real children whose lives are better, whose opportunities are better because of the opportunity of a public school of choice like Navigator Schools.

05:23:15.928 --> 05:23:23.636
And with your approval today of the Watsonville Prep Charter Petition, we work diligently to replicate that success in the Pajaro Valley.

05:23:24.197 --> 05:23:25.318
We thank you for your support.

05:23:25.358 --> 05:23:26.239
We thank you for your time.

05:23:28.862 --> 05:23:32.966
And now the opponents have 10 minutes of the petition opponent.

05:24:00.686 --> 05:24:00.926
Great.

05:24:01.306 --> 05:24:06.029
Good afternoon, President Kirst, fellow board members, and Superintendent Thurmond.

05:24:06.569 --> 05:24:07.750
I'm Michelle Rodriguez.

05:24:07.810 --> 05:24:10.571
I'm the proud superintendent of PVUSD.

05:24:11.352 --> 05:24:16.054
So, we too have a large constituency that is outside in multiple rooms.

05:24:16.915 --> 05:24:24.999
I'm going to specifically speak to our test results and the results that we're seeing in the recent two years.

05:24:26.140 --> 05:24:37.568
And then I'm going to have both parents, both classified certificated principals and district administration speak to some of our other particular points.

05:24:38.388 --> 05:24:44.933
So since the two years in which I've been there, we've really been working on re-envisioning what PVUSD is.

05:24:45.413 --> 05:24:56.937
And we believe that the only way to do that is to implement innovative programs and that those will lead to significant gains in achievement, which will ensure that our students are college and career ready.

05:24:57.637 --> 05:25:05.380
So the main thing that when I came to PVUSD that we needed was to really have a unifying focal point of effort.

05:25:05.822 --> 05:25:10.324
What is our main goal and how are we going to get there?

05:25:10.684 --> 05:25:21.528
And so we established the target for student success and we updated the LCAP goals, which for most of the time we had already met or already exceeded those goals.

05:25:22.008 --> 05:25:29.071
And then we looked at what are the core values and what are we gonna push on and emphasize and value as a unit.

05:25:30.672 --> 05:25:33.194
Then we started to implement innovative programs.

05:25:33.254 --> 05:25:37.878
So as I mentioned, I got there end of September of the previous school year.

05:25:37.898 --> 05:25:42.481
So last school year we started to implement a lot of new innovative programs.

05:25:42.982 --> 05:25:48.326
So we now have the first computer science immersion school in the whole Santa Cruz County.

05:25:49.346 --> 05:25:52.609
at Valencia Elementary, and you see some of our kids there.

05:25:52.969 --> 05:25:59.253
We also now have the Latino Youth Film Institute, which has had remarkable success.

05:25:59.353 --> 05:26:03.696
It's for third through eighth grade students, and it goes on eventually to high school.

05:26:03.756 --> 05:26:04.317
Right now it's

05:26:04.737 --> 05:26:08.041
at the elementary and middle school level in several of our schools.

05:26:08.481 --> 05:26:14.668
And we've seen increase not only in math scores, but also in language arts scores.

05:26:15.229 --> 05:26:20.295
And this is a national level program, and so they've seen this type of success throughout.

05:26:20.775 --> 05:26:35.500
We have El Sistema, which is at two of the schools which they normally compare themselves to, and it ensures that our students have access to visual and performing arts from the very beginning.

05:26:36.180 --> 05:26:39.941
We also are changing the way in which our rooms look.

05:26:39.981 --> 05:26:41.822
So I want you, and it's a little hard,

05:26:42.122 --> 05:26:46.265
I want you to look at what our rooms used to look like.

05:26:46.705 --> 05:26:54.111
So this is a room that for three years, it's almost 1,000 square feet, had not one student in it.

05:26:54.551 --> 05:26:56.653
And it was an old workshop.

05:26:56.713 --> 05:27:10.403
We have changed those rooms to looking to the picture down below, where we now are putting in 21st century STEM learning labs, where at this school, at EA Hall, they can now learn and actually apply what they have.

05:27:10.885 --> 05:27:15.629
We had libraries that were leaking and had old furniture that couldn't move.

05:27:16.209 --> 05:27:23.495
And now we have 3D labs and maker spaces within those spaces.

05:27:23.916 --> 05:27:35.245
I talk about that because it is about the pedagogy, but it's also about ensuring that we can effectively do that pedagogy, which means that we have to change the way in which we're moving.

05:27:35.845 --> 05:27:39.567
We also know that we needed to focus on foundational literacy.

05:27:40.087 --> 05:27:50.993
So we have started a new foundational literacy program called SIPS that is mastery-based, meaning you don't just continue to get passed on, but you actually learn it to mastery.

05:27:51.534 --> 05:27:55.596
And we now have it in 12 of our 16 schools.

05:27:56.056 --> 05:27:58.778
And we saw within one year an improvement from 74% to 94%.

05:28:01.599 --> 05:28:06.523
So when you ask, okay, she's doing all these things, the site is doing all these things, is it working?

05:28:06.743 --> 05:28:09.005
The answer is yes, they are working.

05:28:10.046 --> 05:28:15.131
We also do MAP, Measures of Academic Progress, and I'll speak to CASP in a little bit.

05:28:16.151 --> 05:28:21.156
That is something that we do three times a year that helps us make mid-course corrections.

05:28:21.756 --> 05:28:27.960
The importance of it, it is a national test, and 10.2 million students take the assessment every year.

05:28:28.401 --> 05:28:32.703
So it's not just a few students here, a few students there, but millions of students.

05:28:33.284 --> 05:28:37.787
And last year on MAP, when you look at it, we jumped in percentile.

05:28:37.827 --> 05:28:40.529
So we started all this work, and we jumped.

05:28:40.589 --> 05:28:42.510
I'll just take second grade for the time.

05:28:42.770 --> 05:28:47.994
We went from the 10th percentile, not good, to the 68th percentile in math.

05:28:48.374 --> 05:28:50.495
And in reading, we went from the 12th from the 66th.

05:28:51.816 --> 05:28:56.001
So then you might say, okay, well, can they continue to do that?

05:28:56.581 --> 05:28:57.502
The answer is yes.

05:28:57.602 --> 05:28:58.743
This just came in.

05:28:59.384 --> 05:29:04.129
My board, some of my board members who are here, my president is here as well.

05:29:04.810 --> 05:29:10.275
They haven't actually even seen this because we just took this right before we went off and I wanted you to see it.

05:29:10.976 --> 05:29:22.361
What is important to me is the fact when you look at second grade, we have 56% of our students that are making, that are projected to make two years progress, two years.

05:29:23.481 --> 05:29:29.163
And what's important is that that's an increase of 31% from the previous year.

05:29:30.003 --> 05:29:32.564
And in mathematics, it's 81%.

05:29:33.025 --> 05:29:38.347
And so you can see that our students are making tremendous progress.

05:29:39.318 --> 05:29:49.643
And I wanna talk about these two success stories, because usually these are the numbers that are brought up frequently about, well, look at what Minty White is doing, look at what Radcliffe is doing.

05:29:50.263 --> 05:29:55.205
And I want you to look at their latest results and how much growth they are making.

05:29:56.086 --> 05:30:05.130
They're in the top 99 percentile, beating out 10.2 million students and getting growth with their students.

05:30:06.283 --> 05:30:08.444
So they are making great strides.

05:30:09.025 --> 05:30:14.508
And then when you look at CASP, when you look at SBAC, and you say, okay, well, those are local measures.

05:30:14.648 --> 05:30:17.310
How are you doing on SBAC?

05:30:18.130 --> 05:30:26.576
We wanna make, our goal this next year is to make double-digit growth in each and every grade, but you can see the growth that we made last year.

05:30:27.611 --> 05:30:27.891
Right?

05:30:28.231 --> 05:30:33.213
And when you look at MAP, we can highly correlate it to SBAC.

05:30:33.353 --> 05:30:34.814
It's super correlated.

05:30:35.214 --> 05:30:42.217
We feel very comfortable with these projections, which will help us to get to double digit in all grade levels.

05:30:42.717 --> 05:30:46.519
And in math, you can see the increased growth as well.

05:30:47.319 --> 05:30:52.820
So what we're asking you is to allow PVUSD to keep its positive momentum going.

05:30:53.460 --> 05:31:04.123
What we're asking you is to allow us to continue to have that unified direction, to allocate our funding to our current needs and the upgrading of our current facilities.

05:31:04.863 --> 05:31:08.824
And the equal access, because I am now out of time for Ferris,

05:31:10.265 --> 05:31:14.548
I'll have people speak specifically to all these things.

05:31:15.109 --> 05:31:25.397
But these things, transportation, after school services, special education, these are all things that our students depend on to make sure that they are successful.

05:31:25.958 --> 05:31:26.398
So thank you.

05:31:35.526 --> 05:31:40.909
Good afternoon, President Kirst, members of the State Board of Education, Superintendent Thurmond.

05:31:41.529 --> 05:31:45.131
My name is Faris Sabbah, and like Superintendent Thurmond, this is my third day on the job.

05:31:46.251 --> 05:31:55.756
I am the Santa Cruz County Superintendent of Schools, and I'm here to speak to you on behalf of the Santa Cruz County Office of Education and the Santa Cruz County Board of Education.

05:31:56.196 --> 05:32:02.500
We received the appeal for the establishment of Watsonville Prep in June 21st of this last year.

05:32:03.160 --> 05:32:04.421
We had a public hearing on July 19th.

05:32:05.581 --> 05:32:13.934
We had a review team of 15 educators in consultation with legal counsel who reviewed the petition and its accompanying documents.

05:32:14.676 --> 05:32:19.223
The district staff report, petitioners' responses, and additional documents that were requested.

05:32:20.768 --> 05:32:37.044
We utilized a rubric by the Charter's Authorizer's Regional Support Network, which examined 185 elements that are aligned to the required components of Education Code 47605 and other laws that apply to the charter schools.

05:32:37.725 --> 05:32:42.709
In our review, the special attention was paid to facilities challenges for the school district.

05:32:43.757 --> 05:32:53.361
The review team identified four areas of concern and recommended conditional approval of the charter petition in conjunction with a memorandum of understanding to address those identified areas.

05:32:54.461 --> 05:32:57.822
The review team identified the following primary concerns.

05:32:57.922 --> 05:33:02.364
First, a need for direct local parent involvement in governance.

05:33:03.024 --> 05:33:06.546
Second, a need to have a plan to offer transitional kindergarten.

05:33:07.686 --> 05:33:11.612
Third, I need to revise the re-designation criteria to include lower grades.

05:33:12.312 --> 05:33:16.678
And fourth, I need to have a facilities plan developed in conjunction with the school district.

05:33:17.619 --> 05:33:23.247
As part of its recommendation for conditional approval, staff created a memorandum of understanding that addressed these four areas.

05:33:23.867 --> 05:33:38.237
On August 6th, the County Board of Education decided on a 4-3 vote to deny the appeal on the grounds that the petition did not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of the required elements set forth in Education Code 47605B5.

05:33:39.158 --> 05:33:43.821
In their resolution, they took as their findings of fact the four areas identified by the review team.

05:33:45.302 --> 05:33:50.025
Thank you for the opportunity to describe the involvement of the County Office of Education and the County Board of Education.

05:33:59.795 --> 05:34:00.635
All right.

05:34:00.875 --> 05:34:03.276
So that is the end of the public hearing.

05:34:03.376 --> 05:34:04.117
I close that.

05:34:04.257 --> 05:34:06.458
And now we'll take public comment.

05:34:08.278 --> 05:34:08.558
All right.

05:34:08.598 --> 05:34:11.599
With the first 16 people, please line up at the podium.

05:34:11.779 --> 05:34:28.846
Francisco Rodriguez, Wayne Harris, Angela Deramos, James Dent, Luis Carrillo, Janae Gaber, Luisa Hernandez, Alba Ruiz, Marcela Ibarra, Teresa Chavez, Manuel Rodriguez,

05:34:29.486 --> 05:34:39.294
Vanessa Castaneda, Haley Saldana, Jennifer Evans, Gabby Roldan, Melissa Alatore, Alnas, and Martha Benitez-Denny.

05:34:46.200 --> 05:34:46.440
Go ahead.

05:34:51.504 --> 05:34:51.624
No.

05:34:54.397 --> 05:34:54.677
Ready?

05:34:54.837 --> 05:34:55.077
Go.

05:34:56.158 --> 05:34:56.578
Okay.

05:34:56.638 --> 05:34:58.780
Good afternoon, Board of Education.

05:34:58.820 --> 05:34:59.680
My name is James Dent.

05:34:59.760 --> 05:35:08.226
I'm the Chief Academic Officer for Navigator Schools and I've been a teacher in principal and traditional districts for 15 years and a charter leader for the past eight.

05:35:09.066 --> 05:35:18.052
In 2004, I began my career at Ansel Elementary School in Watsonville where 6% of the students at that time were proficient on the California State Standards.

05:35:18.792 --> 05:35:24.454
The team sprung into action, and our API gained 161 points in three years, which is top in the county.

05:35:25.354 --> 05:35:31.137
And I believe the key to our success was the team, willing to think innovatively and try new things.

05:35:31.537 --> 05:35:36.759
And actually, the origins of the Navigator model, which has been proven to close the achievement gap, was born.

05:35:37.599 --> 05:35:40.140
The importance of teamwork is stronger today than ever before.

05:35:40.660 --> 05:35:45.082
Navigator actively teams with districts, charters, and even universities.

05:35:45.882 --> 05:35:52.571
Today you will hear from several districts, their teachers and leaders that will attest to our collaborative team-based methodology.

05:35:53.072 --> 05:35:58.279
Navigator lives the spirit of the charter law and we hope you support our petition.

05:35:58.580 --> 05:35:58.780
Thank you.

05:36:07.867 --> 05:36:12.572
Thank you, President Kurz, Superintendent Thurmond, and board members.

05:36:13.032 --> 05:36:14.314
My name is Francisco Rodriguez.

05:36:14.434 --> 05:36:30.030
I am the president of the Pajaro Valley Federation of Teachers, which represents certificated staff in the Pajaro Valley Unified School District, and vice president with the California Federation of Teachers, which represents over 100,000 educators across the state of California.

05:36:31.411 --> 05:36:36.233
I am here to ask that you deny the petition for the establishment of Watsonville Prep.

05:36:37.014 --> 05:36:44.478
Admittedly, by every review of the petition, including your staff, the petition is deficient in the area of measurable pupil outcomes.

05:36:45.739 --> 05:36:49.061
Saying no now is not a no forever.

05:36:49.761 --> 05:36:52.783
Navigator schools can always come back with a better

05:36:54.024 --> 05:36:55.304
thought-out petition.

05:36:56.505 --> 05:37:21.541
In addition, I would like to submit for the record two letters, one from Gemma Ables, President of the Morgan Hill Federation of Teachers, and the second, a joint letter in opposition by the California Federation of Teachers, the California School Employees Association, and the Pajaro Valley Federation of Teachers.

05:37:22.042 --> 05:37:22.302
Thank you.

05:37:29.400 --> 05:37:29.980
Good afternoon.

05:37:30.040 --> 05:37:31.281
My name is Vanessa Castaneda.

05:37:31.541 --> 05:37:35.304
I'm a teacher at Gilroy Prep School, and I'm a first-generation college graduate.

05:37:35.804 --> 05:37:40.987
I know firsthand the ability education has to transform individuals, families, communities, and society for the better.

05:37:41.608 --> 05:37:45.170
I can say without question Navigator Schools is the foundation I wish I had growing up.

05:37:45.770 --> 05:37:50.833
School was difficult for me, not because I wasn't smart enough, but because people did not believe in me.

05:37:51.434 --> 05:37:58.338
I worked extra hard to stand out academically because I knew achieving academic success would reassure my parents that immigrating wasn't in vain.

05:38:00.225 --> 05:38:03.249
Students face obstacles every day, academic, social, emotional.

05:38:03.990 --> 05:38:08.496
But at Navigator Schools, every child is equipped to prosper regardless of their circumstances.

05:38:09.177 --> 05:38:15.144
I aspire to be a founding teacher at WPS because I want to make sure every student is able to close the achievement gap just like I was.

05:38:15.845 --> 05:38:17.327
Please vote to approve Watsonville Prep.

05:38:17.347 --> 05:38:17.968
Thank you for your time.

05:38:23.002 --> 05:38:23.782
Good afternoon.

05:38:23.862 --> 05:38:45.331
My name is Gabriella Roldan and I'm a middle school teacher and vice principal in training at Hollister Prep School And I'm here today asking for your support for Watsonville Prep School I'm a first-generation Mexican American English learner from a single-parent household and I'm my family's first and only college graduate the last statement is why I'm standing before you here today and

05:38:46.031 --> 05:38:53.455
I have two very bright siblings whose educational experiences in traditional school settings left them feeling inadequate to attend college.

05:38:54.156 --> 05:38:58.598
Unfortunately, my siblings became part of the statistic we are trying to change.

05:39:00.119 --> 05:39:07.723
Most of the students I work with share my familial background, and yet their educational trajectory doesn't seem to align with those of my siblings.

05:39:08.263 --> 05:39:10.845
Our students are being shown that college is their future.

05:39:11.485 --> 05:39:15.570
So what is the difference between my siblings' experiences and those of my students?

05:39:16.030 --> 05:39:16.972
Navigator schools.

05:39:17.452 --> 05:39:21.217
These young lives and their hard work have been given a platform at Navigator.

05:39:21.617 --> 05:39:26.202
Please support Navigator's petition and allow this to be the experience for the children of Watsonville.

05:39:26.282 --> 05:39:26.643
Thank you.

05:39:33.837 --> 05:39:42.201
Good afternoon, my name is Luis Carrillo and I was the principal of Rod Kelly School in Guerrero Unified for 21 years and three years in Pajaro Valley as a middle school principal.

05:39:42.701 --> 05:39:43.561
I am now retired.

05:39:44.622 --> 05:39:50.644
Rod Kelly is an elementary public school that has seen phenomenal student achievement growth since 2011.

05:39:50.724 --> 05:39:58.488
The reason is due to innovative practices that have been implemented through collaboration with James Dent and Navigator Schools.

05:39:59.068 --> 05:40:04.030
The difference with this charter school is that they want to share these best practices with all school leaders.

05:40:04.530 --> 05:40:07.011
It's a matter of changing our mindset about charter schools.

05:40:07.491 --> 05:40:08.532
They are not all the same.

05:40:09.132 --> 05:40:16.655
Pajaro Valley Unified will have an opportunity to be a partner, share best practices, and improve academic achievement, especially for EL students.

05:40:17.415 --> 05:40:19.036
Their students deserve this opportunity.

05:40:19.496 --> 05:40:27.599
Rod Kelly School, like Gilroy Prep, has been recognized multiple years as a top Bay Area school for low-income students by Innovate Public Schools.

05:40:29.181 --> 05:40:34.092
I know that the Watsonville Public Schools as well as the county will benefit by collaborating with navigator schools.

05:40:34.653 --> 05:40:36.558
I recommend approving Watsonville Prep School.

05:40:36.778 --> 05:40:37.059
Thank you.

05:40:43.120 --> 05:40:43.820
Good afternoon.

05:40:44.021 --> 05:40:46.522
My name is Janann Gaver and I'm a retired educator.

05:40:46.882 --> 05:40:48.283
I currently live in Santa Cruz.

05:40:48.663 --> 05:40:55.287
Before retiring, I worked in Hollisters and I collaborated extensively with Navigator Schools, but I am here today as a community member.

05:40:55.787 --> 05:41:08.915
I also taught in Pajaro Valley for nine years and I know the challenges very well of teaching in a district where the majority of students are English learners and who come from homes where poverty, substance abuse, gang involvement are often a fact of life.

05:41:09.415 --> 05:41:21.650
Navigator's program has proven in both Gilroy and Hollister to overcome these challenges and to enable and even guarantee that children from these families can and will achieve at the same level as their more privileged peers.

05:41:22.250 --> 05:41:27.016
That is why when I heard that the Santa Cruz County Board of Education had denied the charter for Watsonville Prep,

05:41:27.376 --> 05:41:30.379
I was not only shocked and disappointed, I was a little embarrassed.

05:41:30.760 --> 05:41:32.582
And that is why I'm here today.

05:41:32.722 --> 05:41:40.389
I implore you to please write this wrong, approve this charter, and allow Navigator Schools to begin their work in collaboration with the teachers in Watsonville.

05:41:40.530 --> 05:41:40.830
Thank you.

05:41:46.872 --> 05:41:47.392
Good afternoon.

05:41:48.373 --> 05:41:49.413
My name is Martha Denny.

05:41:50.014 --> 05:41:51.094
I have three children.

05:41:51.735 --> 05:41:54.997
Two of the older ones grew up on PVUSD.

05:41:55.957 --> 05:41:57.358
One graduated last year.

05:41:57.418 --> 05:41:59.279
The other one is to graduate this year.

05:42:00.079 --> 05:42:12.967
And as of today, I can tell you I have 14 years of experience dealing with the school district, which is mainly Hispanic, where eight out of 10 of the students between third and eighth grade are not proficient.

05:42:13.827 --> 05:42:18.228
I have not surely seen any of the changes the superintendent is selling to you today.

05:42:19.268 --> 05:42:25.010
My third child is about to start kindergarten this year and I do not want the same fate for her.

05:42:25.790 --> 05:42:40.954
Please help us, me and all the parents outside, with the opportunity to provide our children a better school choice by allowing navigators with a proven record of success within the demographics to open the doors

05:42:41.674 --> 05:42:47.684
and don't allow the bottom line, which is here just money and politics, to be an influence.

05:42:48.105 --> 05:42:48.486
Thank you.

05:42:53.092 --> 05:42:59.036
Hi, Angela DeRamos representing California Teachers Association and we urge you to vote against this petition.

05:42:59.736 --> 05:43:01.317
Watsonville, I live near to it.

05:43:01.397 --> 05:43:02.578
I live in Salinas right above it.

05:43:03.478 --> 05:43:05.840
Watsonville is a very heavily agricultural area.

05:43:05.860 --> 05:43:12.584
A lot of the students live outside the area that the petitioners are talking about.

05:43:13.824 --> 05:43:14.705
getting their students from.

05:43:15.665 --> 05:43:31.330
Many of those students on the outside are the most disenfranchised special ed or migrant students, but we don't see anything in the plan to address recruiting these migrant students or serving them, nor is there money for transportation for special ed students on the surrounding areas.

05:43:31.710 --> 05:43:34.471
For this reason, we urge you to vote against this petition.

05:43:34.571 --> 05:43:34.831
Thank you.

05:43:43.175 --> 05:43:43.976
Buenas tardes.

05:43:44.297 --> 05:43:49.384
Mi nombre es Teresa Chavez y estoy aqui para apoyar a Watsumil Prep.

05:43:49.725 --> 05:43:58.958
Tengo cuatro hijos y el más grande no logró graduarse de la high school porque no encontramos la ayuda necesaria para que lo pudiera lograr.

05:43:59.779 --> 05:44:27.340
y con los otros dos menores seguiremos encontrando y estando en un alto riesgo de no poderse graduar y quisiera que nos apoyaran para que se pueda abrir la escuela aquí en Watsonville para que mi hija tenga un mejor estudio porque mi hijo el mayor no se pudo graduar de la high school porque no hubo lo suficiente para que lo ayudaran.

05:44:28.021 --> 05:44:29.482
Gracias y que Dios los bendiga.

05:44:33.976 --> 05:44:35.636
Hello, my name is Teresa Chavez.

05:44:35.936 --> 05:44:38.557
I'm here in support of Watsonville Prep School.

05:44:39.097 --> 05:44:49.160
I have four children, the oldest one cannot graduate from high school because we did not have the necessary resources and help to support achieve that.

05:44:49.620 --> 05:44:55.561
I have two younger children that also run the risk of running into the same situation as the big brother.

05:44:56.041 --> 05:45:03.563
That is why I ask for your support so that my other children can be provided with a better school, better support, and better education.

05:45:09.352 --> 05:45:10.273
Buenas tardes.

05:45:10.913 --> 05:45:17.377
Mi nombre es Maria Luisa Hernández y voy a comenzar contándoles un poco de mi historia y por qué estoy aquí.

05:45:18.097 --> 05:45:19.678
Soy una madre inmigrante.

05:45:20.238 --> 05:45:22.100
Tengo una hija de cuatro años.

05:45:22.460 --> 05:45:32.686
Llevo dos años y medio estudiando el desarrollo de la niñez en el Colegio Cabrillo de mi comunidad, especializándome en las edades de cero a siete años de edad.

05:45:33.386 --> 05:45:40.649
Haciendo esto, pude darme cuenta que es justo y necesario una educación de calidad para los niños en Watsonville.

05:45:41.089 --> 05:45:47.732
Educación como la que brinda el Colegio Cabrillo en Aptos, California, a través de los centros para la niñez.

05:45:48.252 --> 05:46:00.037
O como la que brinda Hollister Prep y Gilroy Prep, en donde los niños se sienten motivados, con sed de aprendizaje, en donde los maestros saben cuál es su misión dentro del aula.

05:46:00.777 --> 05:46:02.698
Yo ya he hablado mucho, mucho,

05:46:03.408 --> 05:46:24.413
a través de este año de lucha, y he dicho de muchas formas porque necesitamos a Watsonville Prep, pero lamentablemente la gente política encargada de la educación en Watsonville y en Santa Cruz han cerrado sus oídos a nosotros los padres, obedeciendo la voz de sus reyes a los que les financian sus carreras políticas.

05:46:24.673 --> 05:46:25.153
Gracias.

05:46:27.193 --> 05:46:33.357
My name is Maria Luisa Hernandez and I am going to tell you a little bit about my story and why I am here.

05:46:33.377 --> 05:46:35.218
I am a immigrant mother.

05:46:35.238 --> 05:46:37.660
I have a four-year-old daughter.

05:46:37.680 --> 05:46:47.686
I have been studying for two and a half years development and childhood at Cabrillo School, the community college, specializing in age from zero to seven.

05:46:47.966 --> 05:46:52.029
In doing so, I was able to realize that the quality education for children of Watsonville

05:46:52.609 --> 05:46:57.130
Education such as the one offered by Cabrillo School in Aptos, California is urgent.

05:46:57.931 --> 05:47:09.494
Just as necessary through the Centers for Children or like the one that is provided through Hollister Prep School, Gilroy Prep School, where children feel motivated with the thirst for learning and where teachers know

05:47:10.474 --> 05:47:12.215
what their mission is in the classroom.

05:47:12.395 --> 05:47:18.979
I have already spoken a lot throughout this year in this struggle, and I have said it in many ways because we need Watsonville prep.

05:47:19.379 --> 05:47:28.764
But unfortunately, the political people in charge of education in Watsonville and Santa Cruz have closed their ears to our parents' voice to obey their leaders.

05:47:29.204 --> 05:47:29.544
Thank you.

05:47:38.952 --> 05:47:46.315
Buenas tardes, mi nombre es Alba Rivas y estoy aquí en representación de la comunidad de Waxhamby.

05:47:46.455 --> 05:47:53.699
Estoy aquí apoyando para que nos apoyen ustedes a poder abrir nuestra escuela, Waxhamby Prep School.

05:47:54.839 --> 05:48:03.242
En unas oportunidades yo he estado en las escuelas visitando y yo he visto el desarrollo y la dedicación de los maestros hacia los alumnos.

05:48:03.922 --> 05:48:05.763
Y también he visto el enfoque de los niños.

05:48:05.983 --> 05:48:16.806
Me pareció maravilloso la primera vez que yo entré, traspasé la puerta de un salón de segundo grado y ver el enfoque que los niños no se distrajeron en ningún momento.

05:48:17.406 --> 05:48:22.848
Y esa es la razón por la cual nosotros estamos luchando para poder obtener el apoyo de ustedes.

05:48:23.689 --> 05:48:30.319
I think there are many schools in Waxham but unfortunately they are saturated.

05:48:30.619 --> 05:48:32.462
The good schools are saturated.

05:48:32.803 --> 05:48:34.505
I'm not talking ill of any school.

05:48:34.525 --> 05:48:36.408
I'm going to clarify that point.

05:48:36.448 --> 05:48:37.009
We as parents

05:48:38.852 --> 05:48:39.613
foreign foreign

05:48:56.187 --> 05:49:24.372
Gilroy y la de Hollister Prep School fue ver el desarrollo que hay tanto para los niños de necesidades especiales porque si contamos para niños de necesidades especiales y ver a la hora que la maestra hace preguntas con respecto al tema de la clase y todos los niños levantando la mano la dedicación que tanto en educación física tienen para los niños el cuidado sobre el desarrollo de ellos en la tecnología en todo

05:49:25.505 --> 05:49:25.705
Time.

05:49:54.614 --> 05:49:54.894
Sorry.

05:49:56.196 --> 05:49:56.977
May I summarize?

05:49:56.997 --> 05:49:59.560
Yes, you may.

05:49:59.620 --> 05:49:59.821
I'm sorry.

05:50:00.181 --> 05:50:00.301
Yes.

05:50:09.713 --> 05:50:11.294
My name is Alba Rivas.

05:50:11.394 --> 05:50:17.436
I am representing all of the community of Watsonville so that Watsonville Prep School will open.

05:50:17.676 --> 05:50:19.877
We believe in the best education for our children.

05:50:20.097 --> 05:50:29.121
It is best we start with this education early for their lives so they can one day attend the university and we have been supporting a long time hard.

05:50:29.261 --> 05:50:32.142
Please help us achieve our dreams of navigator schools.

05:50:33.122 --> 05:50:34.804
also in summary of what she said.

05:50:35.284 --> 05:50:37.446
She has visited and toured our schools.

05:50:37.806 --> 05:50:45.892
She sees the difference between Pajaro, the school districts that her children has attended versus Hollister Prep and Gilroy Prep.

05:50:46.253 --> 05:50:47.434
She is a parent leader.

05:50:47.754 --> 05:50:49.255
She's very passionate about it.

05:50:49.435 --> 05:50:51.297
She sees the difference of the education.

05:50:51.377 --> 05:51:02.005
She knows the difference and this is what her heart, her passion is pleading for and she's asking for your help and support to help open up Watsonville Prep School in summary.

05:51:05.638 --> 05:51:07.660
Would the following speakers please line up at the podium?

05:51:07.940 --> 05:51:31.478
Erin Fender, Kaitlin Wright, Julie Armstrong, Sarah Ringler, Rebecca Royston, Amy Thomas, Vicky Heloff, Luis Medina, Veronica Aguilar, Esther Murillo, Karen Asmura, Diana Martinez, Ian Licate, Robert Jimenez, Heather Gorman, Carrie LaRue.

05:51:35.623 --> 05:51:36.303
Good afternoon.

05:51:36.664 --> 05:51:41.787
My name is Melissa Alatorre-Almas, and I am the director of HR for Navigator Schools.

05:51:42.307 --> 05:51:47.230
There are so many aspects of my role that I absolutely love.

05:51:47.730 --> 05:51:58.057
But I have to say, seeing the enthusiasm Navigator staff members have for being a part of the founding team at Watsonville Prep School has risen to the top of the list.

05:51:58.957 --> 05:52:09.163
The signatures you received as part of the charter petition are just a fraction of the educators who have shared their desire to work with their education colleagues in the Pajaro Valley.

05:52:09.923 --> 05:52:17.788
Their NAVI history, combined with the outside interest we've received, will combine for an incredible experience for the students of WPS.

05:52:18.588 --> 05:52:27.794
I truly cannot wait for the first day of NAVI 101 next year, which is our intense week-long professional development for all new employees.

05:52:28.956 --> 05:52:34.888
when we can hopefully welcome the inaugural WPS team to the Navigator family.

05:52:35.229 --> 05:52:37.655
Thank you for your time and hopefully your support.

05:52:44.073 --> 05:52:44.753
Good afternoon.

05:52:44.953 --> 05:52:49.476
My name is Haley Saldana and I'm a fourth grade teacher from Gilroy Unified School District.

05:52:50.076 --> 05:52:53.197
I'm here today with the blessing and support of my superintendent.

05:52:53.838 --> 05:52:57.720
I've had the opportunity to collaborate with Navigator Schools for over seven years.

05:52:58.680 --> 05:53:09.826
Every teacher wants their students to be successful and with our ability to collaborate share strategies and even receive trainings from Gilroy Prep we've been able to see successes in closing the achievement gap.

05:53:10.786 --> 05:53:17.912
I've met with teachers at Gilroy Prep, had release days to plan with them, and I was even trained in thinking maps at their site.

05:53:18.532 --> 05:53:26.498
I look forward to continuing to collaborate, knowing that Navigator Schools wants to share innovative ideas to ensure that everyone is successful.

05:53:26.858 --> 05:53:34.844
I see the benefits to having their school in my community, as it has directly impacted my teaching and my students' learning in a positive way.

05:53:35.405 --> 05:53:38.847
For these reasons, I recommend you support and approve Watsonville Prep.

05:53:39.108 --> 05:53:39.388
Thank you.

05:53:44.500 --> 05:53:52.546
Good afternoon, my name is Jennifer Evans and I am also at Gilroy Unified School District at Rod Kelly Elementary where I've been for the last 22 years.

05:53:53.307 --> 05:54:01.133
And while there are countless reasons why I enjoy teaching, I must admit that working with fellow educators to improve our schools is one of my favorite activities.

05:54:01.914 --> 05:54:08.719
So five years ago when I was invited to a training at a local charter school on a new and exciting strategy, I was all in.

05:54:09.640 --> 05:54:16.723
Throughout the training, educators from my school worked side by side with educators from the newest charter school in town, Gilroy Prep.

05:54:17.544 --> 05:54:22.206
We worked together to learn how to incorporate the use of thinking maps into our common core lessons.

05:54:22.866 --> 05:54:36.033
And the fact that GPS opened their campus to our teachers to share this training, which benefited multiple school sites, is just one of many instances when a navigator charter school made a positive impact on the schools in the surrounding area.

05:54:36.793 --> 05:54:46.320
A new NAVI school is sure to bring positive changes to the community of Watsonville, so I strongly encourage you to approve the charter for a new Navigator school.

05:54:46.640 --> 05:54:47.000
Thank you.

05:54:49.662 --> 05:54:50.382
Good afternoon.

05:54:50.983 --> 05:54:53.885
My name is Katrin Wright, and I'm the board chair of Navigator Schools.

05:54:54.845 --> 05:55:05.172
I volunteered my time with Navigator Schools because they serve absolutely transformational educational experiences for all students, including and especially English language learners and low-income students.

05:55:06.153 --> 05:55:15.096
I've spent my career in nonprofits and educational organizations, and I have never seen a more impressive set of schools, nor a more dedicated set of educators.

05:55:15.896 --> 05:55:27.540
Our board is strong, experienced, and diverse, with educators, a chief financial officer, parents and business leaders in the communities we serve, as well as a member of the Pajaro Valley Chamber of Commerce.

05:55:28.706 --> 05:55:35.530
I stand here before you because, as you can understand, I'm deeply moved by the parents of Watsonville.

05:55:36.290 --> 05:55:42.674
They came to our first board meeting more than a year ago to ask us to open this school for them and their children.

05:55:43.315 --> 05:55:48.798
I stand here because I and our board will work tirelessly to deliver this education for students

05:55:49.418 --> 05:55:55.344
to be a great partner to our authorizers, and to become a partner that PVUSD will eventually embrace.

05:55:55.884 --> 05:55:58.707
I hope you give us this opportunity to deliver on these promises.

05:55:59.167 --> 05:55:59.908
Thank you very much.

05:56:04.264 --> 05:56:04.984
Good afternoon.

05:56:05.045 --> 05:56:06.125
I'm Julie Armstrong.

05:56:06.165 --> 05:56:10.088
I'm a retired teacher from Bajaro Valley Unified School District.

05:56:10.768 --> 05:56:14.691
And I'm asking you to please deny Navigator's appeal.

05:56:15.451 --> 05:56:22.736
PVUSD already has some several innovative unionized dependent community charters.

05:56:23.436 --> 05:56:27.019
Alianza, Dual Immersion School, Diamond Tech.

05:56:28.699 --> 05:56:33.700
Pacific Coast Charter, Independent Learning and Watsonville Charter School of the Arts.

05:56:34.320 --> 05:56:44.482
Unlike Navigator, these schools have full public accountability through a publicly and democratically elected board such as yours.

05:56:45.182 --> 05:56:52.784
They also have workers with due process rights who are able to advocate for students without being fired because of it.

05:56:53.883 --> 05:57:01.611
This is exactly what happened at one of our independent charters last year to the dismay of teachers, parents and students.

05:57:02.371 --> 05:57:14.063
We don't need what Navigator has proposed in their petition in order to have lots of schools choices for families while at the same time.

05:57:19.718 --> 05:57:27.447
Hello, my name is Sarah Ringler and it's with great pleasure that I get to address the guardians of public education for the state of California.

05:57:27.467 --> 05:57:33.915
No, I mean you really have an incredible responsibility and I'm a product of California schools from the 50s and 60s.

05:57:33.975 --> 05:57:35.216
My kids went to public school.

05:57:36.057 --> 05:57:43.119
And I just retired from Pajaro Valley after about 30 years of teaching, so I kind of have an idea what goes on there anyway.

05:57:44.759 --> 05:57:47.400
I'm here to speak for somebody else as well.

05:57:47.520 --> 05:57:54.322
I'm representing Joan Lings Whistler, who couldn't make it today, and she also shares the same belief that I do.

05:57:55.422 --> 05:57:57.984
the charter appeal from navigators should be opposed.

05:57:58.865 --> 05:58:03.888
For one thing, Pajaro Valley is already doing all the things that these people are talking about.

05:58:03.908 --> 05:58:10.292
30 years, I've been through a lot of workshops and a lot of the things they've said they've done, we've done as well.

05:58:11.053 --> 05:58:13.615
The other thing is the overcrowded facilities.

05:58:13.675 --> 05:58:14.956
Facilities is a real issue.

05:58:15.296 --> 05:58:16.397
Where do you put the school?

05:58:17.037 --> 05:58:18.878
How does it impact the existing schools?

05:58:19.339 --> 05:58:21.080
So that's it and thank you very much.

05:58:24.258 --> 05:58:24.798
Good afternoon.

05:58:25.059 --> 05:58:25.939
My name is Erin Fender.

05:58:25.959 --> 05:58:30.342
I'm the director of curriculum and instruction for the Healdsburg Unified School District in Sonoma County.

05:58:31.243 --> 05:58:37.167
We serve 60 percent of our students a free and reduced price lunch and 70 percent of our kindergartners are English language learners.

05:58:37.707 --> 05:58:40.389
I'm here today to support the expansion of navigator schools.

05:58:41.069 --> 05:58:53.858
When I took my current position as a preschool through high school curriculum and instruction director I knew I needed to do my homework to better understand and support elementary education as my experience was previously at the secondary and post-secondary level.

05:58:55.159 --> 05:59:03.832
In order to learn and get ideas, I embarked on a year-long collaborative effort with other educators from Healdsburg to find and learn from the highest-performing and equity-focused schools in our state.

05:59:03.952 --> 05:59:10.422
This is how I found Navigator, due to their success supporting high-levels achievement of low socioeconomic status in English language learners.

05:59:11.062 --> 05:59:15.483
Over the last four years, the Navigator schools have been a critical partner to us in Healdsburg Unified.

05:59:15.903 --> 05:59:18.063
They've hosted over 10 visits to their schools.

05:59:19.644 --> 05:59:26.525
Every time, our folks come away full of ideas, energy, and vigor, ready to do what they heard and saw and do better by our students in Healdsburg.

05:59:27.065 --> 05:59:33.507
Navigator has provided all of their curriculum resources to us for free and professional development, both at their site and at ours.

05:59:33.727 --> 05:59:35.147
I encourage you to approve their charter.

05:59:39.943 --> 05:59:40.623
Good afternoon.

05:59:41.064 --> 05:59:50.769
My name is Amy Thomas and I'm the proud principal of the Watsonville Charter School of the Arts, a dependent K-8 charter school located in the Pajaro Valley Unified School District.

05:59:51.489 --> 05:59:54.451
I truly believe that my school is the best school on the planet.

05:59:55.752 --> 05:59:59.957
and an integral part of the school district, rich in culture, diversity, and integrity.

06:00:00.697 --> 06:00:10.609
As a dependent charter school, we are proud to work closely with PVUSD and our union, PVFT, to obtain support, guidance, and benefit from all the resources PVUSD provides.

06:00:11.529 --> 06:00:30.406
I'm deeply grateful to work in a school community full of joy, engagement, and excellence, where throughout the day you'll hear marimbas playing, 3D printers creating, art electives, middle school internships, or students preparing for their invention convention by creating prototypes while experiencing successes and failures.

06:00:31.227 --> 06:00:36.211
So I stand here in front of you today to advocate for dependent charter schools and PVSD.

06:00:37.273 --> 06:00:46.749
WCSA is able to reach the needs of our students and provide them with an arts focused and academically rigorous environment aimed at securing a successful future for college and beyond.

06:00:47.690 --> 06:00:48.011
Thank you.

06:00:54.175 --> 06:00:54.835
Good afternoon.

06:00:54.995 --> 06:01:04.537
My name is Veronica Aguilar and I am the principal of Alianza Charter School, a dependent dual-language immersion K-8 charter school located in Pajaro Valley Unified School District.

06:01:05.138 --> 06:01:14.340
We believe that the Alianza two-way bilingual immersion program offers an important and valuable educational alternative for the children of the district.

06:01:14.860 --> 06:01:19.341
Alianza's mission is to educate students to embrace and improve the world in which they live.

06:01:19.921 --> 06:01:25.403
We do this through our academically rigorous and culturally relevant two-way bilingual immersion program.

06:01:26.004 --> 06:01:33.267
The Alianza community promotes social justice, inspires creativity, challenges intellect, and nurtures potential.

06:01:34.067 --> 06:01:45.612
As a dependent charter school, the Alianza community has worked to achieve the mission and vision of a two-way bilingual immersion program while working closely with PVUSD and our union, PFT.

06:01:46.452 --> 06:01:52.535
This partnership has strengthened what we can provide for our school community and increase accountability for us.

06:01:53.316 --> 06:02:06.142
Together, the district and Alianza have been able to educate bilingual and biliterate students that today are making a difference, many of whom have returned to their community as teachers, nurses, and other professionals.

06:02:06.162 --> 06:02:06.523
Thank you.

06:02:07.603 --> 06:02:08.224
Thanks very much.

06:02:13.240 --> 06:02:17.623
Greetings Dr. Kirst and Superintendent Thurmond and members of the board.

06:02:17.703 --> 06:02:22.305
My name is Vicki Holliff and I am currently the principal of Minty White Elementary in Watsonville, California.

06:02:22.705 --> 06:02:26.948
I've been the principal there for four years now and we have seen tremendous growth in our student achievement.

06:02:27.368 --> 06:02:38.775
With the direction of our superintendent, Dr. Rodriguez, we at Minty White have established a laser-like focus on instructional strategies and are seeing results of these efforts as Dr. Rodriguez mentioned in her previous statement.

06:02:39.415 --> 06:02:44.721
Our NWEA scores, which are the measures of academic progress, demonstrate the results of our efforts.

06:02:45.102 --> 06:02:53.752
The conditional growth percentile, which enables you to compare student scores and correlate the growth patterns with matching peers, demonstrates the success of this focus.

06:02:54.272 --> 06:03:03.424
We have also systematically implemented SIPs to build a foundation for success in phonological awareness, phonics, and sight words, beginning with our K2 students.

06:03:03.464 --> 06:03:07.970
This is a valuable experience for our students and truly supports our second language learners.

06:03:08.411 --> 06:03:11.816
It is the teaching that the brain does to make the brain do the work.

06:03:12.316 --> 06:03:13.977
Minty White teaches the whole child.

06:03:14.017 --> 06:03:22.761
We have an amazing music program called El Sistema, which instills the value of fine arts through music and how that skill set closes the achievement gap for many students.

06:03:22.861 --> 06:03:23.121
Time.

06:03:23.361 --> 06:03:29.364
The success of Minty White is in large part due to the focus of instructional strategies, goal setting with students, and continuous support.

06:03:29.664 --> 06:03:31.264
We ask you to deny this petition.

06:03:31.384 --> 06:03:31.585
Thank you.

06:03:31.605 --> 06:03:32.305
Thank you very much.

06:03:36.513 --> 06:03:48.701
Good afternoon, my name is Rebecca Royston and I teach second grade at Radcliffe Elementary in PVUSD and I'm here to oppose Watsonville Prep whose charter was already denied by our local school board and the county.

06:03:49.541 --> 06:03:54.765
The district's findings show that the charter school presents an unsound educational program for its pupils.

06:03:55.385 --> 06:03:58.047
Our district serves nearly 2,000 migrant students.

06:03:59.483 --> 06:04:07.665
and which the founder of Navigator stated publicly before the PVUSD board vote that they currently do not have any identified migrant students.

06:04:08.345 --> 06:04:10.766
Our students deserve a more thoughtful petition.

06:04:11.006 --> 06:04:20.509
Their program does not yet offer anything that Pajaro schools are not already doing, and they are even less equipped to work with our students, particularly migrant and special education students.

06:04:21.149 --> 06:04:27.971
I urge you to support PVUSD's decision, like that of Morgan Hill, Santa Clara, and Salinas, and deny their petition.

06:04:28.391 --> 06:04:28.671
Thank you.

06:04:36.169 --> 06:04:40.991
Good afternoon, my name is Luis Medina, and I'm the Director of Migrant Education for Pajaro Valley Unified School District.

06:04:41.591 --> 06:04:48.614
Here are some of the services that we provide and why I believe Pajaro is the best place for our migrant students to be served.

06:04:49.374 --> 06:04:56.377
Some of the examples are we provide Chromebooks for students and hotspots to make it accessible to them so they actually can do their work.

06:04:57.117 --> 06:04:59.479
Saturday STEM academies for middle school students.

06:04:59.880 --> 06:05:01.121
After school STEM programs.

06:05:01.641 --> 06:05:04.303
Remotely operated vehicles are programs and competitions.

06:05:04.763 --> 06:05:08.447
Migrant speech and debate competition at the state level.

06:05:09.547 --> 06:05:10.368
Migrant education.

06:05:11.189 --> 06:05:13.611
Growth in voice and engineering through our community college.

06:05:15.132 --> 06:05:22.615
health services, fitness programs where we teach them how to swim and stay healthy, over 30 parent meetings throughout the district.

06:05:24.536 --> 06:05:35.682
These are great programs that migrant students and parents have access within our district, but a major concern that I have is that between all SIDS charter schools within our district, only about 1.5% are migrant students.

06:05:37.823 --> 06:05:45.109
two of the K-8 shutter schools in our district only average one student per site.

06:05:45.330 --> 06:05:45.630
Thank you.

06:05:51.274 --> 06:05:51.814
Good afternoon.

06:05:51.834 --> 06:05:52.875
My name is Esther Murillo.

06:05:53.215 --> 06:05:59.418
I'm a community of Watsonville member and I'm also a parent and future grandparent and a CSEA member.

06:06:00.058 --> 06:06:03.539
PVUSD continues to improve the facilities for its students.

06:06:03.820 --> 06:06:05.780
However sites are still in poor condition.

06:06:06.281 --> 06:06:13.444
Redirecting funds to non-PVUSD students would greatly impact our continued efforts to improve.

06:06:14.404 --> 06:06:20.207
Watsonville Prep does not provide enough staff specialized staff to handle special education.

06:06:21.986 --> 06:06:32.778
And this deficiency could lead to lack of appropriate education services to these students and also not allow them to participate in this school.

06:06:32.919 --> 06:06:33.219
Thank you.

06:06:39.087 --> 06:06:39.747
Good afternoon.

06:06:40.267 --> 06:06:44.869
My name is Diana Martinez and I am the attendance specialist at EA Hall Middle School in Watsonville.

06:06:45.629 --> 06:06:47.790
Loss of ADA equals loss of funds.

06:06:48.370 --> 06:06:50.750
Loss of funds equals loss of staffing.

06:06:51.471 --> 06:06:55.012
Loss of staffing equals loss of services for our students.

06:06:55.772 --> 06:06:58.313
This would be another financial blow to our district.

06:06:59.093 --> 06:07:03.354
At this moment, this is not the time to establish another independent charter.

06:07:03.974 --> 06:07:04.915
Please vote no.

06:07:05.415 --> 06:07:05.755
Thank you.

06:07:11.192 --> 06:07:12.913
Hi, my name is Karen Osmondson.

06:07:13.153 --> 06:07:16.496
I am the president of the Pajaro Valley Unified School District.

06:07:17.597 --> 06:07:24.902
The English language development is totally absent from their assessment plan.

06:07:25.763 --> 06:07:27.184
Absent from the assessment plan.

06:07:27.584 --> 06:07:32.828
They also don't provide curriculum oversight or technology resources.

06:07:35.786 --> 06:07:45.554
their immersion language development is completely contrary to you and to PVUSD.

06:07:45.654 --> 06:07:48.736
It's contrary, their immersion language development's contrary.

06:07:49.597 --> 06:08:02.087
And we have 69% English language learners and we have 90% in their target schools, 90% ELD students in their target schools.

06:08:03.690 --> 06:08:05.385
Please vote no for Navigator.

06:08:11.027 --> 06:08:11.827
Hi, good afternoon.

06:08:11.867 --> 06:08:19.329
My name is Ian Licata and I'm a proud PVUSD teacher at one of our district dependent charter high schools, Diamond Tect.

06:08:20.509 --> 06:08:23.510
What will Navigator give this community that we don't already have?

06:08:23.770 --> 06:08:33.653
Navigator offers nothing that PVUSD schools have not already implemented in our existing K-8 charters, which go above and beyond anything mentioned in the petition.

06:08:34.393 --> 06:08:37.454
In addition, Navigator has high management fees.

06:08:37.874 --> 06:08:42.876
14% of their education dollars go to management versus just 3% in PVUSD.

06:08:43.216 --> 06:08:45.077
This will take money away from the students.

06:08:46.218 --> 06:08:54.021
As a district-dependent charter school, Diamond Tech has accountability to our district and school board and transparency exists on how our site operates.

06:08:55.681 --> 06:08:58.802
Independent charters like Navigator do not have that transparency.

06:08:59.403 --> 06:08:59.883
Vote no.

06:09:00.043 --> 06:09:00.383
Thank you.

06:09:09.414 --> 06:09:10.074
Good afternoon.

06:09:10.494 --> 06:09:14.336
My name is Heather Gorman and I am the SELPA director for PVUSD.

06:09:14.676 --> 06:09:22.259
For over 25 years, I have been a parent, teacher, and administrator in our district and in the community of Watsonville.

06:09:22.919 --> 06:09:31.142
There are several reasons why my team and I believe that Navigator Schools Watsonville Prep should not be granted the charter status in PVUSD.

06:09:32.142 --> 06:09:39.125
Currently, our special education department supports the educational and transportation needs of over 3,000 students.

06:09:39.985 --> 06:09:45.908
As a single SELPA district, we serve all categories of students, including our most severe population.

06:09:46.628 --> 06:09:51.991
To provide severe students in these specialized programs, there is a great need for classroom space.

06:09:52.751 --> 06:10:05.616
We are currently struggling to find adequate facilities to support our current SELPA programs and adding competition for these valued space would be detrimental to the growth of special education programs.

06:10:06.376 --> 06:10:13.478
Our priority has and always will be to provide the best service possible to SELPA students and their families.

06:10:23.004 --> 06:10:23.864
Good afternoon, everyone.

06:10:24.104 --> 06:10:29.226
My name is Kerry LaRue, and I'm a program director with the PVUSD Special Services Department.

06:10:29.886 --> 06:10:37.529
Among other things, I oversee the alternative education programs and the charter schools in our district, specifically supporting students with IEPs.

06:10:38.249 --> 06:10:46.972
I would like to state my opposition to the proposed navigator charter school for the simple reason that PVUSD already has a wealth of school choice available to our parents.

06:10:47.732 --> 06:10:56.577
With open enrollment available at all 16 elementary schools and six middle schools, parents of K-8 students can already choose from a variety of excellent schools.

06:10:57.077 --> 06:11:06.623
And if it's a small group or small school environment that they're seeking, we already have three exceptional dependent K-8 charter schools that operate on the lottery system.

06:11:07.343 --> 06:11:15.288
All of our schools, including our dependent charters, embody such similar priorities and values as to be indistinguishable from Navigator's mission.

06:11:15.928 --> 06:11:27.992
PVUSD has a culture of equity and excellence, data-driven instruction, staff development and coaching, multiple programs to support academics and behavior, and 21st century learning environments.

06:11:28.573 --> 06:11:32.574
Navigator would not add anything to the program choices that we don't already offer.

06:11:33.034 --> 06:11:34.735
Please do not approve this application.

06:11:36.189 --> 06:11:38.249
With the following speakers, please line up at the podium.

06:11:38.430 --> 06:12:05.656
Regina Boyer, Marcy Mock, Kim Saldavia, Brandon Denise, Laura Zucker, Leah Sugarman Rodriguez, Maria Orozco, Maya Campbell, Nelly Vaquera, Boggs, Sherry Osterlin, Michael Berman, Carol Ortiz, Kimberly DeSerpa, Leticia Oropesa, Janet Cravitas, and Wolf James Starkwolf.

06:12:10.438 --> 06:12:16.241
Hello my name is Regina Boyer and I'm a program director with PVUSD Special Services.

06:12:17.241 --> 06:12:25.585
Due to the current statewide staffing shortage our HR department is working diligently just to fill our current special education staffing needs.

06:12:26.365 --> 06:12:38.671
Because Watsonville Prep does not provide enough specialized staff to address certain special education processes this deficiency in their programs could lead to a drain on current PVUSD staff

06:12:39.212 --> 06:12:45.470
and therefore a lack of appropriate educational services for special education students and families in our community.

06:12:47.051 --> 06:12:58.514
Other districts in our area have sought out both our deaf deaf and hard of hearing program and our program for students with behavioral and emotional needs resulting in MOUs with these districts.

06:12:59.194 --> 06:13:08.017
There do not appear to be any assurances that Watsonville Prep will be able to appropriately serve the range of specialized needs of our students with IEPs.

06:13:08.797 --> 06:13:14.359
On behalf of the students and families we serve we are asking that you do not grant this charter request.

06:13:14.699 --> 06:13:15.059
Thank you.

06:13:20.325 --> 06:13:21.085
Come forward, please.

06:13:24.666 --> 06:13:25.287
Good afternoon.

06:13:25.327 --> 06:13:29.508
My name is Laura Zucker, and I'm a speech-language pathologist in PVUSD.

06:13:30.308 --> 06:13:32.349
Please vote no on Navigator's appeal.

06:13:33.109 --> 06:13:46.413
In preparing for this hearing, I read Navigator's current proposal and the denials by PVUSD and the Santa Cruz County Office of Education, but I also looked at the other several previous denials of Navigator's proposed charter schools.

06:13:46.773 --> 06:13:54.662
And I found a pattern in the district's concerns, which included lack of teacher qualifications, unsound educational programs.

06:13:55.263 --> 06:14:01.290
Very important, insufficient support in programs for special ed students, migrant students, English language learners, foster youth.

06:14:01.950 --> 06:14:20.475
an inadequate plan for facilities, and no reasonable comprehensive description of measurable pupil outcomes, employee qualifications, health and safety procedures, how to achieve a racial and ethnic balance reflected of the district, and student suspension and expulsion process, and how to provide sufficient professional development.

06:14:21.976 --> 06:14:26.517
Now, with all the time and opportunities Navigators had to, time.

06:14:26.997 --> 06:14:31.538
do it right, they seem to be struggling still with these very important aspects of serving our population.

06:14:32.398 --> 06:14:33.018
Please vote now.

06:14:37.800 --> 06:14:42.501
Come forward, yeah.

06:14:42.541 --> 06:14:43.721
My name is Robert Jimenez.

06:14:44.781 --> 06:14:49.062
I am a employee at Pajaro Valley Unified School District.

06:14:49.282 --> 06:14:51.343
I work in the maintenance and operations department.

06:14:53.543 --> 06:14:55.664
One of my concerns is the budget includes an

06:14:57.173 --> 06:15:04.161
An ordinary high management fee totaling 40% of WPS's revenue annually.

06:15:04.241 --> 06:15:11.970
The budget is silent as to what services the CMO will provide to justify an expenditure of this magnitude.

06:15:12.090 --> 06:15:15.394
The district percentage is only 3% for district level management.

06:15:16.135 --> 06:15:16.776
Please vote no.

06:15:21.752 --> 06:15:22.352
Good afternoon.

06:15:22.392 --> 06:15:23.873
My name is Maya Campbell-Unsold.

06:15:23.893 --> 06:15:28.054
I'm a second grade bilingual teacher at Landmark Elementary in PVUSD.

06:15:28.554 --> 06:15:42.319
And I just want to start by saying I find it ironic that we're after the LPAC criteria hearing since in the petition that we've previewed, there is no evidence of assessment for English language learners and how to track assessment.

06:15:42.339 --> 06:15:50.502
And in a district that has a large percentage of English language learners, 100% of my students are learning English as a second or third language.

06:15:50.842 --> 06:15:57.950
And there was no evidence of curriculum or assessment plans in the Navigator petition.

06:15:58.030 --> 06:15:59.211
So I just wanted to start with that.

06:15:59.271 --> 06:16:06.999
I'm actually here to submit a letter from one of my parents, who strongly opposes the Navigator petition.

06:16:07.080 --> 06:16:12.505
She has two daughters who went through our bilingual program at the school I work at, and she sees that

06:16:13.948 --> 06:16:22.043
It doesn't serve anything, provide anything we don't already have and it doesn't serve students, our most needy students which are outside of our city limits.

06:16:23.526 --> 06:16:23.887
Thank you.

06:16:28.203 --> 06:16:28.783
Good afternoon.

06:16:29.544 --> 06:16:34.465
My name is Michael Berman, and I'm the Director of Equity State and Federal Programs and Accountability for PVSD.

06:16:35.266 --> 06:16:37.887
My main focus is to support our English learner programs.

06:16:38.407 --> 06:16:46.030
I'm here today to advocate for the direction our district is moving and how it values, supports, and accelerates our students, specifically our English learners.

06:16:46.550 --> 06:16:53.773
I believe that we are forging an effective and powerful English learner master plan that is guided by and aligns extremely well with the EL roadmap.

06:16:54.493 --> 06:17:03.243
We are focused on propagating a district-wide asset-based mindset, access to high-quality instruction for all, and the systems required to support the ongoing growth.

06:17:03.804 --> 06:17:15.056
In order to fully implement this plan, along with our essential needs-based initiatives, the addition of Watsonville Prep would limit our ability and effectiveness to carry out our intended actions and impede our students' progress.

06:17:15.596 --> 06:17:30.448
Additionally, I have concerns regarding, as my colleagues have mentioned, the lack of a comprehensive assessment plan specifically for monitoring the success of ELs, as well as its approach to language development being contrary to our time.

06:17:31.629 --> 06:17:33.471
Thank you very much for your time and your opportunity.

06:17:40.405 --> 06:17:41.746
Hi, my name is Marcy Mock.

06:17:41.887 --> 06:17:43.909
I am a teacher at PBUSD.

06:17:43.929 --> 06:17:48.994
I am strongly opposed to Navigate Tours charter appeal.

06:17:49.014 --> 06:17:57.683
I am also representing someone who could not be here today but wanted to enter their opposition into record and make sure you got the letter detailing their concerns.

06:17:58.303 --> 06:18:06.910
This letter of opposition is from Angela Higgins, president of Hollister Elementary School Teacher Association and a teacher at R.O.

06:18:06.970 --> 06:18:08.351
Hardin Elementary School.

06:18:08.932 --> 06:18:15.957
In summary, she opposes Navigators because her school shares a campus with Hollister Prep School.

06:18:16.618 --> 06:18:18.779
She has witnessed the demographic

06:18:19.820 --> 06:18:43.696
Hall of Navigators school Hollister prep changed over time to be less representative of the demographics of her school next door for example 84% of our Oh Hardin's families are low income as opposed to 17 of Navigator school on the same campus She says this type.

06:18:43.816 --> 06:18:47.078
I'm Charter school creates more segregation.

06:18:47.719 --> 06:18:48.279
Please vote.

06:18:48.359 --> 06:18:48.579
No.

06:18:48.900 --> 06:18:49.240
Thank you

06:18:49.480 --> 06:18:49.548
you

06:18:56.437 --> 06:18:59.138
Good afternoon Board Superintendent Thurmond.

06:18:59.758 --> 06:19:02.959
My name is Kim Saldavia and I'm a teacher at PVUSD.

06:19:03.239 --> 06:19:04.419
I woke up at 4 a.m.

06:19:04.599 --> 06:19:05.480
to be here today.

06:19:06.060 --> 06:19:14.282
Pajaro Valley Unified School District has already denied Navigator months ago and so has Morgan Hill, Santa Clara and Salinas to name a few.

06:19:14.782 --> 06:19:16.343
All have said no to Navigator.

06:19:16.863 --> 06:19:20.464
The PVUSD community is counting on your denial of this appeal.

06:19:21.144 --> 06:19:31.934
PVUSD has 16 elementary schools, five junior highs, three high schools, and serves over 18,000 12K students in which over 80% are migrant.

06:19:32.354 --> 06:19:41.203
The Navigator founder, Sharon Waller, stated publicly that they have not identified migrant students.

06:19:41.463 --> 06:19:44.626
So how will they properly serve this migrant community?

06:19:45.226 --> 06:19:49.348
We also don't have the facilities to house this Navigator organization.

06:19:49.749 --> 06:19:56.833
Our facilities are already busting at the seams and we already have several dependent charter schools in our district.

06:19:57.373 --> 06:20:01.856
Unlike Navigator, these schools have fully public accountability.

06:20:04.177 --> 06:20:05.598
Please vote no on this appeal.

06:20:05.698 --> 06:20:05.998
Thank you.

06:20:10.848 --> 06:20:13.029
Hello, thank you for allowing me to speak.

06:20:13.209 --> 06:20:20.752
My name is Brandon Denise and I'm a special education teacher in the PVUSD and I'm here today to express my opposition to Navigator and Watsonville Prep.

06:20:21.372 --> 06:20:26.815
I'm opposed to Navigator because I believe they will be unable to reach and teach all students.

06:20:27.375 --> 06:20:39.140
With the insufficient education plan they have put forth, it is unrealistic to believe that they will be able to offer a free and appropriate public education to all students included within the 13 categories of disabilities.

06:20:39.820 --> 06:20:48.806
Their plan for supporting special needs students includes a significant expenditure for special education contract services without indicating what these services entail.

06:20:49.367 --> 06:20:58.153
In the Pajaro Valley, there is a significant dearth of uniquely qualified adults with the skills to provide special needs students the education they deserve and are entitled to.

06:20:58.713 --> 06:21:06.819
And to think that Navigator will be able to support these students without having a plan and relying on contract services would be imprudent and impetuous.

06:21:07.240 --> 06:21:09.127
I urge you to please deny this charter.

06:21:09.488 --> 06:21:11.195
We don't need them in the PVUSD.

06:21:11.415 --> 06:21:11.717
Thank you.

06:21:16.803 --> 06:21:17.423
Good afternoon.

06:21:17.564 --> 06:21:20.005
My name is Maria Orozco, PUSD Board Trustee.

06:21:20.646 --> 06:21:28.030
As a former migrant student, I know firsthand the importance of having access to support services to be able to successfully obtain a K-12 education.

06:21:28.611 --> 06:21:37.677
The PUSD migrant program provides services to about 2,000 students ranging from ages 3 to 22 and over 1,000 migrant students during the summer break.

06:21:38.317 --> 06:21:40.999
Navigator does not provide unique services to migrant students.

06:21:41.439 --> 06:21:49.145
PUSD migrant education provides full-time highly experienced bilingual instructional assistants at the elementary sites to work with our K through second grade migrant students.

06:21:49.585 --> 06:21:56.910
They work with small groups and the classroom teacher to fully support the curriculum and provide additional academic support to families.

06:21:57.650 --> 06:22:05.316
Other services include after school tutoring, reading, writing, math classes for elementary migrant students, after school STEAM program, among other services.

06:22:06.216 --> 06:22:13.003
Navigator falls short in addressing the needs of migrant students, one of our most vulnerable student populations in the city of Watsonville.

06:22:13.664 --> 06:22:15.265
Please deny their charter petition today.

06:22:15.545 --> 06:22:15.826
Thank you.

06:22:21.465 --> 06:22:25.048
Good afternoon all, Superintendent Thurmond, board members.

06:22:25.208 --> 06:22:37.640
My name is Leah Sugarman-Rodriguez, and as a PVUSD parent, community member, and SELPA employee, I'm a bilingual resource specialist at Alianza Dependent Charter School.

06:22:38.661 --> 06:22:43.986
I find Navigator's proposal offensive to our teachers, our students, and to our community.

06:22:44.586 --> 06:22:56.680
I feel Navigator is exhausting all avenues to insert their business model for public education into our community who has said loud and clear on two and now three occasions that they are not welcome.

06:22:57.601 --> 06:23:03.628
Navigator says they know better about our community schools and I feel that they are wrong.

06:23:04.429 --> 06:23:11.776
If they know better, their proposal would not be missing key components for English language learners, students in special education, or for migrant students.

06:23:12.356 --> 06:23:16.920
If they cared about our community, they would respect the two denials at the local level.

06:23:17.701 --> 06:23:24.147
Navigator does know that they can use public funds and public facilities to funnel money to their top executives.

06:23:24.167 --> 06:23:25.208
Time.

06:23:25.228 --> 06:23:25.528
Thank you.

06:23:31.175 --> 06:23:34.417
Good afternoon President Kirsch, Superintendent Thurmond, esteemed board members.

06:23:34.857 --> 06:23:35.858
My name is Carol Ortiz.

06:23:35.978 --> 06:23:44.083
I'm the director of after school programs and summer school in PVUSD and I'm the parent of three boys who went through and graduated from PVUSD.

06:23:44.564 --> 06:23:47.746
I'm here as both a Watsonville community member and Watsonville educator.

06:23:48.166 --> 06:23:50.968
I do not support the approval of this charter for multiple reasons.

06:23:51.548 --> 06:24:01.954
As a lifelong resident of Watsonville, I am concerned that Navigator, which has only been in existence for eight years, cannot meet the academic and social emotional needs of the children in my community.

06:24:02.494 --> 06:24:08.498
I do not want my children and my students to be used as part of this publicly funded but privately managed charter school.

06:24:09.318 --> 06:24:18.528
Additionally, I believe it would behoove the board to wait until the new superintendent has had the opportunity to outline his vision and goals for charter schools within California.

06:24:19.089 --> 06:24:27.457
The charter school conversation is shifting across the nation, including the NAACP call for a moratorium on charter schools two years ago.

06:24:28.098 --> 06:24:34.060
as well as the LA Teachers Union demanding common sense regulation on their charter school growth as part of their current negotiations.

06:24:34.740 --> 06:24:42.563
If the board chooses to provide oversight, it makes sense to wait until the new superintendent makes a decision and moves forward with charters.

06:24:42.603 --> 06:24:42.863
Thank you.

06:24:47.191 --> 06:24:50.573
Hi, my name is Janet Kreitzer and I'm a classroom teacher.

06:24:51.133 --> 06:24:55.215
I've taught for 17 years at Hall District Elementary in Las Lomas.

06:24:56.016 --> 06:25:03.120
It's a high needs school where many families work in agriculture and many students are from indigenous families.

06:25:03.900 --> 06:25:09.242
We all work extremely hard to make progress despite many obstacles.

06:25:10.163 --> 06:25:16.245
If Navigator Charter is allowed to access PVUSD resources, it will make our work even harder.

06:25:17.066 --> 06:25:24.209
Navigator does not have migrant students, let alone students from indigenous families who have English as a third language.

06:25:25.089 --> 06:25:29.651
I suspect that Navigator would similarly exclude many other students as well.

06:25:30.531 --> 06:25:37.853
The city of Watsonville was targeted by Navigator presumably because it fit the criteria for their business plan.

06:25:38.774 --> 06:25:42.415
If they succeed, their gain will be a significant loss for many.

06:25:43.388 --> 06:25:49.594
I understand that there is a set of criteria on which Navigator's petition can be denied.

06:25:50.234 --> 06:25:54.258
And there are clear arguments against the petition based on these criteria.

06:25:55.058 --> 06:26:04.026
For me, though, the bottom line is, if Navigator prevails, my students will take yet another hit in their already challenging lives.

06:26:05.007 --> 06:26:05.948
It is not right.

06:26:06.368 --> 06:26:07.309
It is not fair.

06:26:07.870 --> 06:26:09.231
Vote no on Navigator.

06:26:14.844 --> 06:26:16.305
James Starkey Wolfe against.

06:26:17.926 --> 06:26:24.610
I work in Monterey County and at a school that would be excluded.

06:26:24.630 --> 06:26:32.336
I believe that this would be de facto institutional apartheid on an ethnic and language basis.

06:26:33.536 --> 06:26:43.163
The parent meetings that I attended when I worked for the district, there would be typically seven languages from

06:26:44.676 --> 06:26:47.681
Nahuatl to Purépecha.

06:26:48.582 --> 06:26:53.971
And these people aren't even included because they're outside the county.

06:26:54.892 --> 06:26:55.173
Thank you.

06:27:00.731 --> 06:27:02.652
Hello, my name is Nelly Paquera Boggs.

06:27:02.992 --> 06:27:11.374
I am a parent of two children that have gone, one who has finished going through PVSD schools and another one who is completing.

06:27:11.894 --> 06:27:16.635
My daughter is fully bilingual due to the programs that our district offers.

06:27:17.196 --> 06:27:23.037
And my son is ready to go off into the world pretty soon.

06:27:23.637 --> 06:27:24.638
I'm an empty nester soon.

06:27:26.459 --> 06:27:28.141
And I'm also a newcomer teacher.

06:27:28.302 --> 06:27:30.144
So I'm an ESL teacher in our district.

06:27:30.244 --> 06:27:31.406
I'm credentialed.

06:27:31.446 --> 06:27:33.108
I have a bilingual credential to do so.

06:27:36.044 --> 06:27:38.806
We already have excellent programs in our district.

06:27:39.586 --> 06:27:46.770
And my son has needed some of the special programs that our district has in place.

06:27:46.850 --> 06:27:50.573
And so that has helped him be successful and finish school.

06:27:52.193 --> 06:27:55.515
So this next section, I'm just going to say it in Spanish.

06:27:55.555 --> 06:27:57.717
So that was pretty much what I wanted to say in English.

06:27:58.698 --> 06:28:03.864
But I am a mom, and my children have attended the schools in Watsonville.

06:28:04.585 --> 06:28:07.349
My daughter is a student at the university.

06:28:07.369 --> 06:28:08.931
She has had a lot of success.

06:28:08.951 --> 06:28:12.476
She is bilingual and is learning a third language.

06:28:13.116 --> 06:28:15.820
And my son just finished school and is prepared.

06:28:16.801 --> 06:28:19.084
Please vote no to Watsonville corporate charter.

06:28:19.104 --> 06:28:19.585
Thank you.

06:28:19.625 --> 06:28:22.468
I also have a letter that I'd like to submit on the behalf of another teacher.

06:28:22.488 --> 06:28:22.728
Thanks.

06:28:42.642 --> 06:28:48.306
Good afternoon, and congratulations to Superintendent Thurmond on your recent swearing in.

06:28:48.846 --> 06:28:55.331
My name's Kimberly DeSerpa, and I am one of seven elected officials on the board of trustees for Pajaro Valley Unified.

06:28:55.351 --> 06:28:58.693
I'm also the proud mother of a high school senior this year.

06:28:58.713 --> 06:29:01.335
I have two children.

06:29:01.835 --> 06:29:11.241
My son, I'm also somebody who has had kids in charter schools in the past, so I understand that choice can be important for kids.

06:29:12.182 --> 06:29:16.143
I left a very busy health care practice today to address you for this one minute.

06:29:17.004 --> 06:29:23.626
We as a board rejected Navigator's petition on the grounds for which our staff and colleagues have already illustrated for you.

06:29:24.446 --> 06:29:32.909
This sound decision was additionally supported and codified by the Santa Cruz County Board of Education who agreed with us that Navigator's petition was not sound.

06:29:34.509 --> 06:29:41.272
Our district has six charter schools already, or 15.4% of our schools are already charter schools.

06:29:41.912 --> 06:29:46.994
If we add this extra school, it'll bring us up to 17.5% of our schools in charter schools.

06:29:47.514 --> 06:29:48.195
I ask you- Time.

06:29:48.215 --> 06:29:48.515
Really?

06:29:53.138 --> 06:29:56.359
I just ask you, how many charter schools should a district have?

06:29:56.419 --> 06:29:58.539
It's the dismantling of public education.

06:29:59.179 --> 06:30:00.139
We cannot afford this.

06:30:00.179 --> 06:30:01.480
We have no facilities for this.

06:30:02.060 --> 06:30:05.080
And I urge you to vote no on the petition in front of you today.

06:30:05.260 --> 06:30:05.620
Thank you.

06:30:07.181 --> 06:30:10.301
With the following speakers, please line up at the podium.

06:30:10.681 --> 06:30:20.743
Darlene Wilcox, Maria Luisa Hernandez, Alba Rivas, Marcella Salas, Kristen Carr, Crystal Tarumi, Leah Martinez,

06:30:22.381 --> 06:30:41.677
Allison Stull, Rosa Segura, Alex Heredia, Sharon Waller, Brian Greenberg, Manuel Serrano, Mary Jo Silva, Janelle Rooley, Ramel Antoine, Tammy Ortiz, John Wise, Sarah Henney, Tristan Brown, Victor Sandoval, Eric Premack, and Kristen Schaus.

06:30:46.988 --> 06:30:47.568
Good afternoon.

06:30:48.109 --> 06:30:49.730
My name is Sherry Osterlin.

06:30:50.010 --> 06:30:53.052
I am a teacher at Pajaro Middle School in Watsonville.

06:30:53.632 --> 06:30:55.633
This is my 26th year of teaching.

06:30:55.973 --> 06:30:58.155
I've not taught at Watsonville all my career.

06:30:58.175 --> 06:31:00.796
22 of those years were in Ohio.

06:31:02.657 --> 06:31:07.460
When I became a little disillusioned with teaching, and I came out here.

06:31:07.480 --> 06:31:10.222
And it's been amazing.

06:31:10.602 --> 06:31:15.645
In the two and a half years that I've been in Watsonville, I feel like a new teacher again.

06:31:16.354 --> 06:31:17.535
I am full of that energy.

06:31:18.496 --> 06:31:24.140
And I just wanted you to know that, that it's not, I don't even have my roots here.

06:31:24.801 --> 06:31:28.744
And this is just a bad thing to come in and do this to our district.

06:31:29.184 --> 06:31:33.427
But I do want to tell you something I've noticed in these six plus hours I think I've been here.

06:31:35.109 --> 06:31:41.653
I watched all your issues or the items earlier because my son's an attorney and I'm fascinated by things that are like hearings.

06:31:42.234 --> 06:31:52.322
And I have noticed that in all of, most of the items that you presented, one of the things that you said often, a couple of you said often was, you know, you need to go to your local district.

06:31:52.362 --> 06:31:54.123
You need to go to your local community.

06:31:54.163 --> 06:31:55.784
You need to go to your county community.

06:31:55.984 --> 06:31:57.145
See what they can do for you.

06:31:58.606 --> 06:31:59.527
They did that.

06:31:59.767 --> 06:32:01.888
They came to us and we voted no.

06:32:02.728 --> 06:32:06.170
Then they went over our heads and went to our counter and they voted no.

06:32:07.090 --> 06:32:10.752
Please honor what you preach and deny this petition.

06:32:11.172 --> 06:32:11.512
Thank you.

06:32:11.813 --> 06:32:12.993
I also have a letter I'll leave.

06:32:13.013 --> 06:32:21.637
Hola.

06:32:22.057 --> 06:32:23.398
Buenas tardes.

06:32:24.919 --> 06:32:26.119
Mi nombre es Maria.

06:32:26.560 --> 06:32:27.300
Maria Hernandez.

06:32:29.383 --> 06:32:39.169
Yeah, we need a translator, yeah.

06:32:39.209 --> 06:32:41.671
Hello, my name is Maria and I am from Watsonville.

06:32:41.851 --> 06:32:45.013
Outside we were being asked if we were from Watsonville.

06:32:48.476 --> 06:32:51.800
I said, yes, I am from Watsonville.

06:32:52.521 --> 06:32:58.247
About four years ago, I left Watsonville to go live in Hollister.

06:33:17.475 --> 06:33:23.117
I left the Watsonville district with certain things that my daughters did not learn.

06:33:33.721 --> 06:33:38.364
We arrived to Hollister and Hollister provided that learning that my kids needed it.

06:33:38.825 --> 06:33:43.048
Allá afuera hay madres que yo conocí en ese tiempo.

06:33:43.348 --> 06:33:45.930
Right outside there are mothers that I used to know back then.

06:33:46.230 --> 06:33:54.496
Y yo no puedo creer que todavía en este tiempo siga habiendo los mismos problemas con las escuelas en Watsonville.

06:33:54.676 --> 06:33:59.680
And I cannot believe that up until now they're still having the same issues at the Watsonville schools.

06:34:01.147 --> 06:34:02.287
Me da tristeza.

06:34:02.607 --> 06:34:03.448
I'm very sad.

06:34:04.168 --> 06:34:06.449
Me da impotencia.

06:34:06.709 --> 06:34:08.029
I feel frustrated.

06:34:08.049 --> 06:34:15.931
Y al verlas aquí, pude entender que necesitamos todos, todos como una comunidad.

06:34:16.752 --> 06:34:20.673
And when I saw them, I saw that it's needed as a community.

06:34:21.853 --> 06:34:23.734
El mismo aprendizaje.

06:34:23.974 --> 06:34:25.234
The same learning.

06:34:25.914 --> 06:34:27.555
No nada más unos cuantos.

06:34:27.735 --> 06:34:28.435
Not just a few.

06:34:30.948 --> 06:34:34.530
But all of us.

06:34:41.574 --> 06:34:47.537
If you could go outside, you will see that there are different dialects, they're Spanish, who want a change.

06:34:50.780 --> 06:34:56.306
Because of that, I beg you that Watsonville Prep, it's open.

06:34:56.626 --> 06:34:57.006
Please.

06:35:12.691 --> 06:35:14.592
Good afternoon, my name is Leticia Ropesa.

06:35:14.652 --> 06:35:17.313
Thank you all very much for having me here.

06:35:18.493 --> 06:35:22.094
Superintendent Thurman, yay.

06:35:22.354 --> 06:35:26.076
I met you at California School Employees Association Conference in July.

06:35:26.516 --> 06:35:31.638
I'm here to tell you about, I am a district employee, Pajaro Valley Unified School District employee.

06:35:31.738 --> 06:35:34.039
I am in child welfare and attendance.

06:35:34.639 --> 06:35:40.781
And on a monthly basis, I see students and their parents come into my office devastated

06:35:41.181 --> 06:35:46.286
because they have been turned away from our local charter schools, one in particular.

06:35:47.667 --> 06:35:53.192
The week that we were here in December, there was a young man that walked through my door in tears with his...

06:35:57.697 --> 06:35:59.579
with his transcript in hand and his mother.

06:36:00.299 --> 06:36:01.580
And they were devastated.

06:36:01.680 --> 06:36:05.563
They didn't know why they had been told that there was no longer any room for them.

06:36:05.924 --> 06:36:06.965
A freshman student.

06:36:07.345 --> 06:36:08.546
I took a look at his grades.

06:36:08.606 --> 06:36:09.767
I contacted the school.

06:36:10.027 --> 06:36:12.429
Maybe it's an expulsion, perhaps.

06:36:12.789 --> 06:36:13.250
It wasn't.

06:36:13.890 --> 06:36:15.311
It was just someone

06:36:16.212 --> 06:36:18.654
needed that space that was more important than him.

06:36:18.754 --> 06:36:20.775
That's what the parent concluded.

06:36:21.215 --> 06:36:22.816
Because they did come back and tell me that.

06:36:22.836 --> 06:36:28.139
So on that and many other bases, I don't want to see any more children or parents heartbroken.

06:36:28.540 --> 06:36:32.302
Please do not accept this charter school petition.

06:36:32.642 --> 06:36:45.770
And I'm very saddened because of all the people that are out there sitting there who speak Spanish or speak Mixteco, and they are not getting any type of assistance in hearing what is going on here in English.

06:36:46.210 --> 06:36:49.272
So that's my second reason for being very upset.

06:36:49.332 --> 06:36:54.255
I'm sitting out there with them and I know that they are not getting, receiving any of the services.

06:36:54.835 --> 06:36:56.956
30 minutes in, they handed them all speakers.

06:36:57.276 --> 06:36:59.798
Many of them said, I don't even know how to work that, so.

06:36:59.998 --> 06:37:05.581
We have, can I just ask CDE staff, don't we have translators, am I right, provided for?

06:37:06.461 --> 06:37:07.802
Yeah, go ahead, come forward.

06:37:07.822 --> 06:37:08.983
Okay, next person please.

06:37:13.865 --> 06:37:14.666
Go ahead.

06:37:15.768 --> 06:37:16.669
My name is Marcela.

06:37:16.749 --> 06:37:22.652
I'm here on behalf of the people that could not make it today asking for your support in letting Watsonville Prep School open.

06:37:22.772 --> 06:37:28.555
We believe the kids of Watsonville will have a great opportunity and an amazing education.

06:37:29.015 --> 06:37:31.916
We've seen the kids in these schools, Hollister and Gilroy Prep.

06:37:32.337 --> 06:37:40.901
These kids are amazing, well-spoken, mannered, smart, incredibly intelligent, so focused on their work, eager to learn and answer questions from their teachers.

06:37:40.961 --> 06:37:44.103
The level at which the kindergartners are reading is just incredible.

06:37:44.643 --> 06:37:50.066
The teachers in the classrooms, the technology, the test scores, all these kids are getting, it's just amazing.

06:37:50.486 --> 06:37:51.727
We want this for Watsonville.

06:37:51.767 --> 06:37:54.268
These schools are really molding the minds of the future.

06:37:54.728 --> 06:37:59.751
And with all this that we have seen at these schools, Watsonville is in for something really amazing.

06:38:00.311 --> 06:38:03.072
Please give this wonderful opportunity to our kids.

06:38:04.053 --> 06:38:04.293
Thank you.

06:38:09.312 --> 06:38:10.813
Hello, and thank you for your time.

06:38:11.233 --> 06:38:16.858
My name is Kirsten Frances Carr, and I am the Director of Engagement and Partnerships for Navigator Schools.

06:38:17.538 --> 06:38:35.492
As I shared with the ACCS commissioners, our preference for the city limits of Watsonville was based on a desire to reach the most traditionally underserved students, a desire which was captured better than I ever could by the recent YMCA commercial that starts with, your zip code shouldn't determine your future.

06:38:36.352 --> 06:38:42.175
And that right there is why we are focused on the areas with large populations of underserved students.

06:38:42.855 --> 06:38:47.017
The children in Watsonville have had their zip code determining their future for years.

06:38:47.697 --> 06:38:50.159
And now we want to help change those futures.

06:38:50.779 --> 06:38:55.881
We strive to locate our schools in areas where the free and reduced lunch population is at least 80%.

06:38:56.902 --> 06:39:01.284
As you saw in the materials we sent, the area we are targeting reflects those numbers.

06:39:01.864 --> 06:39:07.137
We want to ensure these students have the opportunity to succeed regardless of their circumstances.

06:39:07.618 --> 06:39:11.126
Please support Watsonville Prep for the students of Watsonville.

06:39:11.226 --> 06:39:11.547
Thank you.

06:39:16.343 --> 06:39:20.385
Hello, my name is Crystal O'Rourke Toriumi and I'm the principal of Gilroy Prep School.

06:39:20.885 --> 06:39:29.728
I have the honor of speaking to you today as both a founding Navigator employee and as a K-12 graduate of Watsonville Public Schools.

06:39:30.509 --> 06:39:40.253
My family, friends, and heart reside in Watsonville and I am both thanking the staff for the recommendation of approval and asking you to support the petition for Watsonville Prep.

06:39:41.133 --> 06:39:48.361
Ever since my first day at Navigator, I have dreamt of taking what I have learned to positively impact the community, which means so much to me.

06:39:49.062 --> 06:39:52.505
And I believe a Navigator education is a key component of that change.

06:39:53.486 --> 06:40:00.093
What really attracted me to Gilroy Prep when I was a district employee was the collaborative nature present amongst all staff members.

06:40:00.894 --> 06:40:04.676
From day one, the goal was to learn together and collaborate with other districts.

06:40:05.417 --> 06:40:12.161
It was such a joy when five principals and several teachers from Watsonville, Pajaro Valley, toured Gilroy Prep last year.

06:40:12.861 --> 06:40:18.524
And we look forward to continuing to work with educators across the state of California for the benefit of all students.

06:40:19.145 --> 06:40:19.425
Thank you.

06:40:25.492 --> 06:40:26.052
Good afternoon.

06:40:26.393 --> 06:40:31.056
My name is Allison Stull and I am a proud small group instructor or SGI at Hollister Prep School.

06:40:31.636 --> 06:40:36.219
I am also in the process of getting my teaching credential with hopes of one day teaching at Watsonville Prep School.

06:40:36.840 --> 06:40:44.505
My decision to further my career at Navigator Schools is as much about the children we serve as it is about the amazing educators I get to call teammates.

06:40:45.105 --> 06:40:55.232
We choose to work together always trying to do more learning new strategies improving our use of data and finding opportunities to partner with our district partners to help all children.

06:40:56.172 --> 06:41:03.196
We do this because we want to, because we believe in the power of coaching, and because we made a choice to be part of this public school option.

06:41:03.857 --> 06:41:09.360
I'm asking you today to support our choice and the choice of so many others by approving the appeal for Watsonville Prep School.

06:41:09.560 --> 06:41:09.820
Thank you.

06:41:14.824 --> 06:41:15.665
Good afternoon.

06:41:15.685 --> 06:41:20.191
I am honored to be here under as much of a long journey this has been.

06:41:20.251 --> 06:41:24.938
My name is Sharon Waller, Director of Student Services and one of the co-founders of Navigator Schools.

06:41:25.939 --> 06:41:28.923
I'm also a proud third generation graduate of Watsonville High School.

06:41:30.505 --> 06:41:35.630
I am excited about our work that we're doing with other districts regarding the sums grant.

06:41:35.650 --> 06:41:36.491
We received that.

06:41:37.052 --> 06:41:42.017
We are trying to model our school after the state task force report that you guys all put out.

06:41:42.457 --> 06:41:46.141
We believe strongly in full inclusion for our students.

06:41:46.582 --> 06:41:50.326
We believe strongly in being a model school for full inclusion.

06:41:50.346 --> 06:41:52.428
There aren't enough of those in California.

06:41:53.168 --> 06:41:59.032
And we look forward to working with other districts in the area of special education.

06:41:59.052 --> 06:42:02.014
I have 35 years experience in special education.

06:42:04.015 --> 06:42:07.878
We want to be part of the change in California as you all do.

06:42:07.978 --> 06:42:11.140
And I know all these passionate people behind me do as well.

06:42:11.700 --> 06:42:15.243
So thank you for your time and consideration of our charter petition.

06:42:20.868 --> 06:42:21.448
Good afternoon.

06:42:21.668 --> 06:42:24.850
My name is Rosa Segura, and I'm here to support Navigator Schools.

06:42:25.590 --> 06:42:34.534
My daughter is a special education student at Hollister Prep with learning disabilities and muscle disorder that affect her fine and gross motor skills.

06:42:34.954 --> 06:42:40.297
When she was little, we thought she would not be able to read, to write, to jump, or even to kick a ball.

06:42:40.857 --> 06:42:45.279
The student service department is providing the therapy and services she needs.

06:42:45.780 --> 06:42:52.383
They're always looking for different materials, different reading programs, different ways to teach her and help her succeed.

06:42:53.023 --> 06:43:00.107
The way that the school is full inclusion school is helping her develop and grow in the way that what did not think was possible.

06:43:00.847 --> 06:43:05.130
Now she's able to write, to jump, to run, to read.

06:43:06.751 --> 06:43:10.597
and she's enjoying her childhood at the school.

06:43:11.538 --> 06:43:18.649
Please let the Watsonville families have a strong navigator social and emotional learning experience for their children as well.

06:43:19.350 --> 06:43:19.650
Thank you.

06:43:24.778 --> 06:43:26.900
Hello, my name is Alexandra Heredia.

06:43:27.240 --> 06:43:30.302
I'm proud to be in this room once again supporting Watsonville Prep.

06:43:30.763 --> 06:43:36.507
I have been part of the Reading is Fun Club in Watsonville, and seeing the students excited about learning makes my night.

06:43:36.908 --> 06:43:39.190
And getting to know their parents has been an added bonus.

06:43:39.690 --> 06:43:49.197
My ties to Watsonville, my role as a navigator, special education paraprofessional, focused in getting my special education resource credential have made me very committed to opening WPS.

06:43:50.158 --> 06:43:55.499
Every day I see the impact our full inclusion model has on students who might otherwise be in a self-contained classroom.

06:43:56.259 --> 06:43:58.080
I see students working in small groups.

06:43:58.440 --> 06:44:03.061
No child is feeling as if they were different than anybody else or not part of the school community.

06:44:03.561 --> 06:44:10.882
The equity point on our compass is why I come to work every day and why I truly believe that students of Watsonville deserve this public school option.

06:44:11.322 --> 06:44:15.503
I'm asking you for these students and for all of Watsonville to please approve WPS.

06:44:15.723 --> 06:44:16.023
Thank you.

06:44:20.037 --> 06:44:23.959
Hi my name is Leah Martinez and I'm a middle school teacher and a vice principal in training.

06:44:24.679 --> 06:44:29.921
Watsonville is my hometown and I'm a teacher signatory on the petition before you.

06:44:30.422 --> 06:44:34.503
I stand here today asking to approve WPS for the community I hold so dear.

06:44:35.284 --> 06:44:41.386
I came to Navigator three years ago because of the mission and I saw the difference the schools were having on the students we serve.

06:44:41.927 --> 06:44:46.509
I signed the petition and I'm here today because I want to see that same impact on my hometown.

06:44:47.729 --> 06:44:50.970
Every teacher I know wants what's best for the students they serve.

06:44:51.050 --> 06:44:54.672
We work so hard to provide our students with the best education.

06:44:55.392 --> 06:45:02.234
At Navigator, we want to be able to work with teachers throughout the Pajaro Valley to share best practices to help all students succeed.

06:45:02.995 --> 06:45:08.697
I love having educators tour my classroom, provide feedback for me, and take pieces of knowledge wherever they go.

06:45:09.477 --> 06:45:13.758
I truly look forward to seeing PBSD educators on campus next fall.

06:45:13.899 --> 06:45:14.619
Please support us.

06:45:14.679 --> 06:45:14.979
Thank you.

06:45:20.177 --> 06:45:22.219
Good afternoon, or maybe good evening.

06:45:22.659 --> 06:45:23.199
I'm not sure.

06:45:23.239 --> 06:45:24.180
It's been a long day.

06:45:25.781 --> 06:45:27.343
My name is Tammy Ortiz.

06:45:28.083 --> 06:45:31.246
I'm a 22-year veteran of the Hollister School District.

06:45:31.646 --> 06:45:39.932
And I felt just like the PVUSD parents and teachers when Navigator was coming to Hollister.

06:45:40.513 --> 06:45:46.838
However, since coming to Hollister, I have had a radical change in perspective.

06:45:47.578 --> 06:45:51.242
I don't even think of Navigator anymore as being a charter school.

06:45:52.022 --> 06:46:02.672
I think of Navigator as being an excellent resource for both schools and districts to improve instruction for students, all students.

06:46:03.633 --> 06:46:07.516
They aren't just committed to their students and teachers, they're committed to

06:46:09.181 --> 06:46:11.662
the students and teachers in the entire community.

06:46:12.243 --> 06:46:13.644
Why am I saying this?

06:46:13.744 --> 06:46:19.187
Well, I called two of my friends because I'm the literacy coach and

06:46:20.655 --> 06:46:22.177
My teachers were driving me crazy.

06:46:22.217 --> 06:46:26.341
They needed small group help, because we adopted benchmark advance.

06:46:27.102 --> 06:46:33.049
And within three weeks, they had not only trained my staff, but staff across our district.

06:46:33.769 --> 06:46:41.458
Anyway, thank you, and definitely consider their paperwork for entering PVUSD.

06:46:46.158 --> 06:46:46.458
Hello.

06:46:48.219 --> 06:46:48.820
Good afternoon.

06:46:48.840 --> 06:46:49.960
My name is Manuel Serrano.

06:46:50.921 --> 06:46:55.423
I am a teacher, the early childhood education teacher at the Pajaro Valley Unified School District.

06:46:56.444 --> 06:47:00.306
I am strongly opposed to Navigator Chapter Appeal.

06:47:01.467 --> 06:47:13.334
I would like to point out our district is on a winter break this week, and we still have this beautiful and dedicated group of people willing to take the time to travel out of town to oppose this chapter.

06:47:14.065 --> 06:47:14.645
petition.

06:47:15.086 --> 06:47:20.249
We even have folks that brought their young children because it's really important.

06:47:20.649 --> 06:47:31.917
I said this because this is the third occasion our community has come out strong to inform educational board, such this one, that we don't want navigator in our district.

06:47:32.877 --> 06:47:44.407
I want to emphasize that the people who will be most impacted by this business coming into our district are the students and the employees who spend most of their waking hours at the Pajaro Valley Fire School District.

06:47:44.907 --> 06:47:51.113
Please, please back us up and respect our double decision to deny Navigator.

06:47:52.274 --> 06:47:56.597
Please leave the public funding and public education.

06:47:56.858 --> 06:47:57.158
Thank you.

06:48:03.683 --> 06:48:04.403
Good afternoon.

06:48:05.244 --> 06:48:14.066
My name is Mary Jo Silva and like Manuel Serrano, I am an early childhood educator with the Pajaro Valley Unified School District.

06:48:15.307 --> 06:48:19.408
I am speaking in opposition to the Navigator's appeal.

06:48:21.069 --> 06:48:27.151
Pajaro Valley already offers what Navigator is proposing.

06:48:28.871 --> 06:48:31.512
Currently, there are charter schools available.

06:48:32.112 --> 06:48:34.233
Another one is not necessary.

06:48:34.773 --> 06:48:42.335
So please, in short, please support the decision to deny Navigator's petition.

06:48:42.835 --> 06:48:43.175
Thank you.

06:48:58.486 --> 06:49:01.208
Good afternoon, Board and Superintendent Thurmond.

06:49:01.228 --> 06:49:02.128
I'm happy to see you here.

06:49:02.588 --> 06:49:03.549
My name is Sarah Henney.

06:49:03.569 --> 06:49:06.310
I am both an educator and a parent in the PVUSD.

06:49:06.750 --> 06:49:08.651
My daughter, Eliana, has Down syndrome.

06:49:08.711 --> 06:49:09.212
She's three.

06:49:09.652 --> 06:49:14.414
And I'm very pleased that she's attending Duncan-Holbert, a special education preschool in our district.

06:49:15.094 --> 06:49:21.037
Since having Ellie, I've learned a lot about special ed and the processes and what it means to provide appropriate services.

06:49:21.558 --> 06:49:25.480
I've also gotten to know quite a few parents in our district who also have children who are part of our SELFA.

06:49:26.460 --> 06:49:32.043
Their children's needs vary greatly and for many those needs change and intensify as their children grow.

06:49:32.684 --> 06:49:42.569
Our district has met those varying and changing needs because they have the staff expertise and community relationships to make sure that they can secure needed services regardless of how unique they are.

06:49:43.270 --> 06:49:48.613
It would be nearly impossible for Navigator to even approximate what our district and SELPA are able to provide.

06:49:49.253 --> 06:49:56.975
I also find it strange that the students in the special ed at their school will be part of a faraway SELPA that will somehow provide long-distance support.

06:49:57.535 --> 06:50:07.418
As part of the special ed community in PVUSD, I can assure you that is not what parents want for their kids or for themselves as they navigate the difficulties and nuances of getting appropriate services.

06:50:07.778 --> 06:50:09.138
Please vote no on Navigator.

06:50:19.315 --> 06:50:22.298
Good afternoon, Board President Kirst, Board Members, Superintendent Thurman.

06:50:22.598 --> 06:50:23.699
My name is Janelle Rooley.

06:50:23.759 --> 06:50:31.547
I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Young, Middie, and Core here today in strong support of Watsonville Prep, and we certainly urge your approval today.

06:50:32.988 --> 06:50:42.117
Watsonville Prep is proud to have earned a recommendation for approval from the CDE, a unanimous recommendation from the ACCS, as well as a recommendation for approval from the county.

06:50:43.138 --> 06:50:45.161
This is truly an extraordinary program.

06:50:45.822 --> 06:50:55.376
I've been attending meetings like this for a dozen years and I don't think I've ever seen employees from another school district come out and take their time to support a charter school like this.

06:50:56.057 --> 06:50:58.660
So I do think that Watsonville will benefit from this program.

06:50:59.281 --> 06:51:06.164
We've heard a lot of public comment today, both from district employees expressing their concerns and from local parents asking you to bring this charter there.

06:51:06.184 --> 06:51:17.708
I always have to remind you, though, that our decision is really based on the four corners of that document and whether or not we have findings in the specific areas set forth in law to deny the charter.

06:51:17.748 --> 06:51:19.229
Those findings are not there today.

06:51:19.609 --> 06:51:20.870
So, again, we seek your approval.

06:51:20.930 --> 06:51:21.210
Thank you.

06:51:25.287 --> 06:51:25.868
Good afternoon.

06:51:26.048 --> 06:51:28.890
I'm Brian Greenberg, the CEO of the Silicon Schools Fund.

06:51:29.491 --> 06:51:35.317
We've worked in partnership with the State Board on several high-performing schools in the past, and I'm actually deeply appreciative of our partnership.

06:51:35.897 --> 06:51:42.263
Silicon Schools, as you know, supports the top schools in the state, district and charters, working towards innovative new models.

06:51:43.124 --> 06:51:54.110
Our school scored the 73rd percentile of the state, and I've prepared a data slide for you to see that Navigator Schools even wallops our high-performing district average, or portfolio average.

06:51:54.810 --> 06:52:03.015
Of all the schools that we have helped open over the last seven years, Navigator Schools is arguably the very best and highest-performing set of schools.

06:52:03.835 --> 06:52:06.498
I've personally been to their campus dozens of times.

06:52:06.998 --> 06:52:11.423
And I'm amazed by the quality of teaching in their classrooms and how engaged their students are.

06:52:11.984 --> 06:52:15.427
These are simply marvelous, marvelous schools.

06:52:16.508 --> 06:52:20.693
That's why we've proposed and given such a large grant to support opening this campus.

06:52:20.933 --> 06:52:22.094
And these aren't just test scores.

06:52:22.134 --> 06:52:24.797
These are great educators running great schools.

06:52:26.021 --> 06:52:34.379
These schools are so good that I'd send my children to them, which is the standard I think that we should be holding and why there's so many parents out here asking for this for their families.

06:52:34.639 --> 06:52:34.920
Thank you.

06:52:38.680 --> 06:52:39.180
Good afternoon.

06:52:39.440 --> 06:52:45.042
My name is Kirsten Schaus and I've had the pleasure of working in all three district regions, Gilroy, Hollister, and Watsonville.

06:52:45.583 --> 06:52:56.367
I stand before you today as the assistant superintendent of secondary schools for Pajaro, really urging you to look at this not as the issue that folks are trying to make it, which is pro or con charter, but about equity.

06:52:56.947 --> 06:53:04.592
The two lenses and the six denial reasons, when you look at two of those very specific reasons with what the CDE presented, there were two very specific pieces.

06:53:04.652 --> 06:53:08.174
That first piece looked at the ethnic balance and found that there was an ethnic balance.

06:53:08.554 --> 06:53:09.995
But what about the homeless balance?

06:53:10.115 --> 06:53:11.255
What about the foster youth?

06:53:11.335 --> 06:53:12.276
What about the migrants?

06:53:12.596 --> 06:53:17.459
We have 13 to 17% of our population that are foster, homeless, and migrant.

06:53:18.139 --> 06:53:25.544
That is not an equitable practice when we open a charter that does not give our students access, but claims to be looking for the lowest socioeconomic need.

06:53:26.224 --> 06:53:30.285
The other aspect that we need to look at with the petition for the charter is the transportation issue.

06:53:30.725 --> 06:53:32.785
This is not Gilroy and this is not Hollister.

06:53:32.845 --> 06:53:36.406
The needs of Watsonville are much different than that and the region is much larger.

06:53:36.786 --> 06:53:39.907
Eliminating busing and not having a busing plan isn't an equity.

06:53:40.587 --> 06:53:50.509
We cannot stand before you as a charter petition and say that we're looking for equity when what this really has been about is eliminating the equity that we have had for our highest need and most at risk students.

06:53:50.809 --> 06:53:51.069
Thank you.

06:53:57.608 --> 06:53:59.610
Good afternoon, Board President, Board Members.

06:54:00.090 --> 06:54:01.171
My name is Victor Sandoval.

06:54:01.192 --> 06:54:05.896
I'm the Director of Maintenance Operations and Facilities for the Paro Valley Unified School District.

06:54:06.437 --> 06:54:08.919
Today, I want to talk to you about facilities.

06:54:09.480 --> 06:54:16.947
Basically, the district is made up of roughly about 32 schools, a little over 550 acres, only of which we can use only 58% of that.

06:54:20.339 --> 06:54:26.662
With that, we have roughly about 1,042 buildings and 34% of those are portables.

06:54:27.243 --> 06:54:28.703
Some of those portables are older than I am.

06:54:30.084 --> 06:54:33.126
Right now, currently, PVSD lacks facilities.

06:54:34.486 --> 06:54:40.049
The last possible development is being done as we speak by the City of Watsonville.

06:54:40.650 --> 06:54:48.154
However, that development, the Sunshine development, is creating student-generated ratios that are exceeding our capacity.

06:54:49.173 --> 06:54:56.971
Again, this is one of the reasons that we can't either house another charter school within our district boundaries.

06:54:57.552 --> 06:54:58.033
Appreciate it.

06:54:58.094 --> 06:54:58.334
Thank you.

06:55:04.008 --> 06:55:08.090
Hello, my name is Jerry Phippitt, Program Director for PVUSD Special Services.

06:55:08.450 --> 06:55:10.832
I'm reading this letter on behalf of Board Member Jennifer Holm.

06:55:11.452 --> 06:55:15.054
Last November, I had the honor of being elected to the PVUSD Board of Trustees.

06:55:15.634 --> 06:55:21.017
I believe in the power of strong public schools to enrich communities and form foundation for strong democracy.

06:55:21.497 --> 06:55:24.020
That belief is what drove me to run for office.

06:55:24.501 --> 06:55:25.722
I believe in the power of choice.

06:55:26.002 --> 06:55:37.195
My daughter was able to graduate because of options offered through alternative education, but the choices before us, elected officials, parents, and voters must be good ones when we hold the future of our community students in trust.

06:55:37.856 --> 06:55:43.258
The Navigator-Watsonville PREP program is different than the charter school options already offered in our district.

06:55:43.518 --> 06:55:51.361
Top-heavy management spending, 14% of the projected revenue compared to 3% at district level, seems unjust and fiscally irresponsible.

06:55:51.781 --> 06:56:01.965
Furthermore, the idea that public school funds could be siphoned to private interests with no accountability or recite by the governing board chosen by voters goes counter to the democratic processes.

06:56:02.725 --> 06:56:08.432
Benefiting a small number of students to the significant detriment of the children left behind is morally and ethically wrong.

06:56:08.572 --> 06:56:10.755
I urge the board to vote no on the petition.

06:56:16.624 --> 06:56:30.737
Hi, my name is John Wise and I'm a parent and employee of PVUSD and I would like for you to deny Watsonville Prep based on the fact that PVUSD students need access to social emotional wraparound services.

06:56:31.477 --> 06:56:41.566
Each PVUSD elementary school has an assigned social emotional counselor as well as a licensed therapist through the Pajaro Valley Prevention Students Assistance.

06:56:42.507 --> 06:56:45.609
a resource that's not available to Watsonville Prep students.

06:56:46.230 --> 06:56:49.392
Over 7,000 students access this support each year.

06:56:50.392 --> 06:56:56.757
PVUSD social-emotional counselors provide training and trauma-informed instructions to the staff.

06:56:57.237 --> 06:57:01.960
It is also unclear how services during suspensions will be addressed.

06:57:02.401 --> 06:57:09.705
Watsonville Prep has not specified where students will go for a change of placement while they're awaiting a hearing.

06:57:10.106 --> 06:57:10.426
Thank you.

06:57:14.679 --> 06:57:19.762
Eric Premack, Charter Schools Development Center, in here in support of the staff recommendation to grant the charter.

06:57:20.622 --> 06:57:27.406
We've been working with Navigator for many years and are familiar with its very strong reputation and sound operations.

06:57:28.326 --> 06:57:33.329
Their leader, Kevin Sved, is one of the state's most experienced and distinguished charter school leaders in the state.

06:57:33.989 --> 06:57:51.385
I also note that one of my staff who spent several days on site last year, and she's very picky as a former charter school director herself, she said, I was especially impressed with their approach towards special education, which oriented all instructional staff in an authentic, skillful way toward meeting the needs of each individual student.

06:57:51.905 --> 06:57:59.813
This is the type of thing that we've seen out of this organization across all their schools and hope that they will be able to continue that and that you will support the appeal.

06:57:59.873 --> 06:58:00.153
Thank you.

06:58:04.127 --> 06:58:06.068
Good afternoon, board, superintendent.

06:58:06.528 --> 06:58:09.129
Ramel Antoine with the Charter Schools Association.

06:58:09.569 --> 06:58:12.310
Associating my comments with my colleague, Eric Premack.

06:58:12.450 --> 06:58:20.893
Also, I wanted to say that Navigator serves almost a thousand students over their two existing sites, and they've done the work to understand what sound replication looks like.

06:58:21.414 --> 06:58:27.756
Navi has an incredible amount of community support in the room and outside, and that's really incredible.

06:58:27.876 --> 06:58:29.557
These families are ready for Watsonville Prep.

06:58:30.257 --> 06:58:44.338
In the communities where they are currently located, Navigator works hard to live up to the promise of the Charter Schools Act, which in part challenges charter public schools to be collaborative members in their community, lifting the ecosystem and becoming fabric of public education.

06:58:45.620 --> 06:58:47.662
These parents cannot afford to wait any longer.

06:58:47.883 --> 06:58:49.725
They want a better option for their kids now.

06:58:50.165 --> 06:58:54.170
They want a choice that represents the quality they deserve and the time for these families is now.

06:58:54.670 --> 06:58:59.836
We've worked closely with these families and they have been incredibly open to our feedback.

06:59:00.237 --> 06:59:06.023
We are proud to offer our unconditional support of what we know will be a critical option for these students and families in Pajaro Valley.

06:59:06.304 --> 06:59:06.544
Thank you.

06:59:11.107 --> 06:59:15.869
Last but not least, good afternoon Board, Tristan Brown with the California Federation of Teachers.

06:59:16.630 --> 06:59:35.519
I just want to reiterate that on top of all of the reasons you've heard from the local community why the petition should be denied, we just wanted to highlight something was in our letter as well that recently the Attorney General released a memo notifying everyone that indeed Government Code 1090 and so for other public protection laws do apply to charter schools.

06:59:36.179 --> 06:59:46.146
This question was raised during the ACCS hearing and the proponents merely said, yes, we'll comply with the, I believe it was Public Records or Political Reform Act, but did not address the 1090 question.

06:59:46.266 --> 06:59:56.554
We think this is a vital area that needs to be enforced and this is something that helps protect parents and taxpayers and anyone from malfeasance that occurs from self-dealing on a board.

06:59:56.974 --> 07:00:06.719
So we think it's vitally important that this petition be denied to reset, go back, work with the local community, bring back a petition that is actually fit for that community.

07:00:06.739 --> 07:00:08.180
The locals have spoken.

07:00:08.260 --> 07:00:16.164
We hope that you agree with them and concur with them and also push this notice that you cannot self-deal on the board and 1090 is a very important part of that law.

07:00:16.224 --> 07:00:20.586
So thank you very much for your time and hope you side with the locals control.

07:00:20.686 --> 07:00:20.907
Thanks.

07:00:22.347 --> 07:00:23.748
Okay, that concludes.

07:00:24.188 --> 07:00:24.909
Oh, there's one more.

07:00:25.049 --> 07:00:25.409
I'm sorry.

07:00:27.682 --> 07:00:35.004
Congratulations, Mr. Thurman, and thank you for listening and working so hard, board.

07:00:35.724 --> 07:00:50.487
My name is Darlene Wilcox, and I'm here to speak to you as the proud parent of a stepdaughter who became a fashion designer thanks to balanced programs in the public schools of California.

07:00:52.102 --> 07:00:56.805
My stepdaughter is the first in her family to graduate from college.

07:00:57.605 --> 07:00:58.966
And be careful what you wish for.

07:00:58.986 --> 07:01:03.909
I just now, like some 10 years later, finished paying for her education at UC Davis.

07:01:04.770 --> 07:01:09.473
And she's had a great career as a fashion designer, is raising a lovely son.

07:01:10.253 --> 07:01:11.654
And actually, it's been longer than that.

07:01:12.815 --> 07:01:13.635
I get confused with time.

07:01:13.675 --> 07:01:17.358
But anyway, I did finish paying, whether it was 12 years or 10 years.

07:01:17.478 --> 07:01:20.440
OK, so what are the reasons that she was able to graduate?

07:01:21.680 --> 07:01:25.844
She had excellent intervention after having to repeat kindergarten.

07:01:26.304 --> 07:01:29.827
She was an early entry kid, so would have been a TK now.

07:01:30.107 --> 07:01:30.447
Time.

07:01:30.727 --> 07:01:35.171
Then she had sports, the possibility to do student government, and arts.

07:01:35.451 --> 07:01:43.077
But the arts in our schools, I bring another letter from a VAPA teacher, are really impacted by our facilities lack.

07:01:43.217 --> 07:01:44.918
So she's taking around, along with 18 other

07:01:46.399 --> 07:01:52.521
a rolling cart that has to be covered with garbage bags in the winter when it rains.

07:01:52.961 --> 07:02:01.564
So please consider this as you think about if our district is ready and think about denying right now Navigator Charter.

07:02:07.282 --> 07:02:07.902
Good afternoon.

07:02:08.022 --> 07:02:13.064
My name is Mark Virch and I'm the supervisor for the Pajaro Valley Unified School District Transportation Department.

07:02:14.204 --> 07:02:18.426
We are in a crucial time for the Pajaro Valley Unified School District Transportation Department.

07:02:18.926 --> 07:02:25.528
We, like many other transportation departments in the state of California, are facing shortages, staffing shortages.

07:02:26.249 --> 07:02:35.372
And because of this, we have daily challenges to meet the department's obligation of delivering and picking up students in a safe and efficient manner for their education.

07:02:37.202 --> 07:02:41.324
We are dedicated to building our staff and building capacity within our department.

07:02:41.844 --> 07:02:49.288
And we do not feel that we have the necessary resources to sufficiently add in another service to our system.

07:02:49.728 --> 07:02:50.048
Thank you.

07:03:06.403 --> 07:03:17.549
I'd like to first thank God for allowing me to be here today, and I also want to thank you for allowing me to speak in front of you today.

07:03:17.629 --> 07:03:19.350
My name is Carlos Cruz.

07:03:22.492 --> 07:03:23.973
I am from Oaxaca, Mexico.

07:03:24.493 --> 07:03:27.555
My parents always wanted a better education for me.

07:03:38.460 --> 07:03:43.824
My parents chose to move from Oaxaca to Mexico to allow for me and my siblings to have a better future.

07:03:43.844 --> 07:03:50.970
And everything was going well until a decade later when we decided to move to the United States because of the economics of Mexico.

07:04:01.385 --> 07:04:04.726
Once here, we were searching for the American dream and I found out that there were a lot of opportunities.

07:04:04.746 --> 07:04:08.167
But I could not comprehend why a lot of the youngsters were not taking advantage of them.

07:04:30.049 --> 07:04:33.810
It was later that I understood the factors that were actually impacting the students.

07:04:34.510 --> 07:04:38.171
Primero, teniendo a ambos padres trabajando.

07:04:39.452 --> 07:04:43.493
Segundo, un sistema educacional desactualizado.

07:04:43.913 --> 07:04:49.914
First, having two working parents and then having an education system that is old.

07:04:50.875 --> 07:04:53.855
Tercero, maestros que no hacen su trabajo.

07:04:54.176 --> 07:04:56.656
Y cuarto, el problema de las drogas.

07:04:56.776 --> 07:04:59.417
Chicos vendiendo y consumiendo drogas en los baños.

07:04:59.721 --> 07:05:03.162
Third, teachers who are not prepared.

07:05:03.322 --> 07:05:07.164
And fourth, students who are dealing and doing drugs in the bathrooms.

07:05:07.184 --> 07:05:13.106
So then I realized that that is not the type of education that I want for my daughters.

07:05:13.226 --> 07:05:14.186
I have three daughters.

07:05:15.427 --> 07:05:15.527
Time.

07:05:27.136 --> 07:05:31.981
And that's why I'm here to demand a better education like that that is offered through Navigator School for my daughters.

07:05:32.582 --> 07:05:33.243
Dios los bendiga.

07:05:33.503 --> 07:05:34.044
May God bless you.

07:05:42.828 --> 07:05:43.568
Good afternoon.

07:05:43.768 --> 07:05:45.369
My name is Glafira Regalado.

07:05:45.829 --> 07:05:47.970
I am from Watsonville.

07:05:48.570 --> 07:05:52.551
I'm a parent of six children, four who are over 18.

07:06:00.274 --> 07:06:16.599
I have two minors, one is in high school and the other should be in middle school, but he didn't want to go to school since grade 6 and until now we haven't made him go to school, neither the teachers nor the counselors.

07:06:18.900 --> 07:06:31.623
I have two children in school still, one in high school, one in middle school, but after that child who is supposed to be in middle school after sixth grade, he refused to go to school and we were unable to motivate him, us counselors and teachers, to return back to school.

07:06:41.006 --> 07:06:55.623
I would like to, because my 16-year-old son doesn't want to go to high school anymore because of what he says, that there is a lot of discrimination from teachers towards them, so I'm here to support.

07:06:56.904 --> 07:07:02.588
And the reason why I'm here is to ask that you do open and allow the Navigator School.

07:07:02.868 --> 07:07:11.313
My 16-year-old is now telling me that he does not want to go to school for the same reason that the younger one doesn't want to go, because they feel that there's a lot of discrimination towards them in the schools.

07:07:11.433 --> 07:07:14.875
And he is now too discouraged to attend school for that reason.

07:07:21.719 --> 07:07:27.384
And so I ask for those two sons of mine, but also for my grandchildren, who I also have in the same school district.

07:07:27.404 --> 07:07:34.549
And so I'm here to ask from the bottom of my heart that you do approve this school for them and for the community of Watsonville.

07:07:50.203 --> 07:07:50.605
Thank you.

07:07:50.626 --> 07:07:51.148
May God bless you.

07:08:03.043 --> 07:08:03.604
Good afternoon.

07:08:05.644 --> 07:08:06.904
My name is Laura Rodriguez.

07:08:07.085 --> 07:08:09.185
I'm representing Watsonville PrEP.

07:08:09.565 --> 07:08:12.966
And I want to ask you to please say yes to Watsonville PrEP.

07:08:13.006 --> 07:08:15.127
Because right now my kids are at Hollister PrEP.

07:08:25.410 --> 07:08:31.233
Y también vengo representando a mi hermano que está trabajando y que pertenece a Watsonville.

07:08:31.453 --> 07:08:36.035
I'm also here representing my brother who is at work, but he is in Watsonville.

07:08:36.275 --> 07:08:43.238
Y quiero una oportunidad para mis sobrinos que tengo en Watsonville Prep así como la que tienen mis hijos ahorita en Hollister Prep.

07:08:43.438 --> 07:08:48.341
And I want an opportunity for my nephews just as my kids have it in Hollister Prep.

07:08:49.261 --> 07:08:52.004
Because that happened to me with my older son.

07:08:52.024 --> 07:08:52.785
He's now in the 12th grade.

07:08:52.805 --> 07:08:54.607
Some of the teachers were not fair to him.

07:08:54.787 --> 07:08:56.849
With my son, the one who was in the 12th grade.

07:09:09.242 --> 07:09:16.464
And also with my kids who are now in the seventh grade and they used to be in the school in that district.

07:09:16.844 --> 07:09:18.644
Because I can see a huge difference.

07:09:18.684 --> 07:09:22.605
Because my kids, when they used to be in the other school district, they used to cry.

07:09:38.829 --> 07:09:40.490
And they did not want to get up to go to school.

07:09:40.871 --> 07:09:42.732
And then I started getting worried.

07:09:42.792 --> 07:09:45.133
What was the reason they don't want to get up to go to school?

07:09:57.619 --> 07:10:00.700
After that, I started noticing that they did not want to get up to go to school.

07:10:00.780 --> 07:10:01.900
They would like cry.

07:10:01.940 --> 07:10:03.141
They would throw tantrums.

07:10:03.901 --> 07:10:06.122
They used to tell me they don't want to go to school.

07:10:06.142 --> 07:10:08.843
So I would ask him, why is it that you don't want to go to school?

07:10:08.863 --> 07:10:12.504
There's got to be an important reason why you don't want to go.

07:10:19.386 --> 07:10:22.090
time and I started getting involved.

07:10:22.651 --> 07:10:24.574
I became a volunteer so I could see what was going on.

07:10:35.657 --> 07:10:49.763
Okay, I think that concludes the public comment and I'm going to ask our liaison to this particular charter, Trish Williams, to open the questions that she has and response.

07:10:51.269 --> 07:10:54.171
Everybody take a deep breath, relax.

07:10:54.191 --> 07:10:55.873
That was a lot of public comment.

07:10:56.433 --> 07:10:59.535
Reminded me of accountability in previous months.

07:11:01.317 --> 07:11:18.790
What I would like to do, I wanna make a statement first, just to remind, most in the audience probably does not understand this, unless you work here in the department or at the state level, but the law requires the State Board of Education

07:11:19.430 --> 07:11:26.336
to review charter school petitions with de novo review, which means fresh eyes.

07:11:26.977 --> 07:11:30.400
It is not, we are not making a decision to overturn.

07:11:30.820 --> 07:11:38.367
If we choose to authorize a charter school, it is not a decision to overturn a previous decision by the district or a county.

07:11:38.787 --> 07:11:43.131
It is left to our judgment to look at a charter petition

07:11:44.072 --> 07:11:59.665
know the law that we're supposed to be guided by in terms of what it should include, do our homework, which we have staff, luckily have wonderful staff to do at CDE and State Board, do the homework to check into operations, fiscal support,

07:12:00.525 --> 07:12:13.415
any kind of other issues or problems, look at the quality of the petition and see if it's reasonably comprehensive and has all of the things that we think would make it a good school and does it have community support.

07:12:13.695 --> 07:12:15.316
That's our role and that's our job.

07:12:16.096 --> 07:12:24.823
So before I move on, I would like to ask the petitioner, maybe the chief academic officer, maybe the school founder as well, to come back to the podium.

07:12:24.863 --> 07:12:26.444
I have just a couple of questions for you.

07:12:35.231 --> 07:12:48.301
The questions I have have to do with the fact that this school was recommended by the county staff, and then a 4-3 split vote by the board.

07:12:49.382 --> 07:13:01.672
And then it went to the ACC, then it came here, and the CDE staff recommends approval of it, has looked at it thoroughly, done an analysis, and is recommending approval.

07:13:02.597 --> 07:13:12.863
Then it went to the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools, and Board Member Holliday and I, who are the two liaisons for charter schools, we attended that advisory commission and sat through the hearing.

07:13:13.403 --> 07:13:23.569
It's always really helpful for us because in addition to a staff analysis, we get to hear a commission of people that know a lot about charters and what kind of questions they ask.

07:13:24.649 --> 07:13:28.271
It's like a dress rehearsal, in a way, before the state board meeting.

07:13:28.731 --> 07:13:35.753
And the ACCS recommended unanimously to recommend approval to the state board, and that doesn't happen very often.

07:13:36.674 --> 07:13:49.419
So what I want to ask you is, some of the public commenters that are wanting a denial of the petition mentioned concerns about how Navigator handles special ed.

07:13:50.339 --> 07:14:01.187
They, in particular, mentioned a concern about this school and the large migrant community that is in the area and how that might be handled by this school.

07:14:02.528 --> 07:14:06.711
And one of them made a comment about Hollister.

07:14:07.231 --> 07:14:13.919
navigator starting out serving high numbers of low-income kids and now they only serve 17% low-income kids.

07:14:14.400 --> 07:14:22.389
And so I'm wondering if on those three issues which would be troublesome if, could be troublesome if you could address from your perspective.

07:14:22.509 --> 07:14:23.669
Yeah, I'll go ahead and give it a start.

07:14:23.689 --> 07:14:38.934
Again, my name is James Denham, the chief academic officer, and I wanted to just go back to my days at Anselda Elementary as the vice principal and serving a population of students that were, there was a high migrant population and we had a special day class on campus as well.

07:14:39.575 --> 07:14:43.696
And with those populations still had incredible student achievement.

07:14:44.836 --> 07:15:02.062
Right now at our Hollister Prep campus we have between 10 and 12 percent migrant which is a little bit higher than the district average and we have built essentially a program for our students that thinks first intervention and then getting the students as advanced as possible.

07:15:02.082 --> 07:15:04.663
So we have a very deep multi-tiered system of support.

07:15:05.683 --> 07:15:08.605
which essentially encompasses any student's needs.

07:15:10.226 --> 07:15:16.309
I think at the ACCS report it was noted that nine out of the 13 special education disabilities we already serve those students.

07:15:16.329 --> 07:15:19.831
We have not had the other four and we have never turned a student away.

07:15:24.714 --> 07:15:39.182
I will say that in thinking about the special ed in particular, I have been a principal in district schools and I've been with Navigator, and we have built out a special ed department that I think is, to my experience, world class.

07:15:39.903 --> 07:15:45.446
Each of our sites has seven to nine full-time special ed staff.

07:15:45.946 --> 07:15:46.867
on campus.

07:15:47.207 --> 07:15:58.758
It is a completely full inclusion school and having been in Guillory Unified, I know there are probably six to seven kids at each site that wouldn't be in special day classes in the districts.

07:15:59.178 --> 07:16:05.844
And so we really take this extremely seriously and I'll let Sharon pick up on the special ed in particular because that's her background.

07:16:06.328 --> 07:16:08.068
Well, there's not much more to say.

07:16:08.108 --> 07:16:12.690
We are members of good standing with the El Dorado County Charter, SELPA.

07:16:12.750 --> 07:16:15.070
We follow all the laws for special education.

07:16:15.570 --> 07:16:17.271
We have not turned a student away.

07:16:18.211 --> 07:16:25.313
We recruit heavily into like the state preschools that are some of the full inclusion preschools.

07:16:25.753 --> 07:16:28.374
And so we have like, for example, our kindergarten class

07:16:29.594 --> 07:16:35.778
At each campus was over 10% of students identified as students with special needs.

07:16:36.119 --> 07:16:43.723
And as they're with us and are participating in the full inclusion program and receiving the supports, those numbers go down.

07:16:44.384 --> 07:16:49.467
We're identifying less students at an older age because we're trying to prevent them from going in in the first place.

07:16:49.867 --> 07:17:00.210
But we are committed to providing the students the range of services that they require and our budget reflects that as well.

07:17:01.031 --> 07:17:03.931
We do bring in supports as the students need them.

07:17:04.952 --> 07:17:08.633
Two more quick questions and you may or may not be the person to answer them.

07:17:09.514 --> 07:17:20.366
One of the commenters or maybe a couple of them mentioned that they didn't see that there was an ELD element to the curriculum and any assessment of ELD.

07:17:20.887 --> 07:17:23.150
I'll let them answer that, but there is.

07:17:24.615 --> 07:17:28.959
Yes, and I also forgot one other thing, which was the percentage of free and reduced lunch at Hollister Prep.

07:17:31.021 --> 07:17:31.901
Yeah, it's 62.5%.

07:17:32.702 --> 07:17:34.724
So those numbers are incorrect for Hollister Prep.

07:17:34.984 --> 07:17:37.606
Gilroy Prep, I believe, is 49% free and reduced lunch.

07:17:37.966 --> 07:17:41.729
Both of the schools, I will say, started over 80% free and reduced lunch.

07:17:42.350 --> 07:17:48.215
And we have worked with students with a lot of the issues that come with poverty at our schools.

07:17:49.235 --> 07:17:52.716
With regards to ELD, I want to start with some data.

07:17:53.176 --> 07:17:56.277
And that is around our kinder, first and second graders.

07:17:56.297 --> 07:18:02.660
When we opened Gilroy Prep School, we had 117 ELs out of 180, which is just shy of two-thirds at 65%.

07:18:05.000 --> 07:18:10.022
When looking at those students last year as sixth, seventh, and eighth graders, we had 108 left in the school that had not left.

07:18:10.042 --> 07:18:10.962
106 of them were reclassified.

07:18:16.764 --> 07:18:20.707
One of them was a student that was in special day in kinder and first grade when he came to us in second.

07:18:21.327 --> 07:18:24.349
The other student is currently a sixth grader and now a seventh grader.

07:18:24.889 --> 07:18:30.192
He's our only student, with the exception of the students with special needs, that has not been reclassified.

07:18:30.753 --> 07:18:36.136
Our reclassification criteria at this point includes proficiency on SBAC.

07:18:36.716 --> 07:18:43.962
So that means of those students, 106 of the 108 met or exceeded standard.

07:18:44.462 --> 07:18:47.125
So we're very proud of our ELD program.

07:18:47.485 --> 07:18:54.811
We do have a designated ELD program and our entire program the rest of the day is an integrated program that really deals with students.

07:18:55.451 --> 07:19:00.394
With regards to assessments, our assessment program is the same for all of our subjects.

07:19:00.814 --> 07:19:10.760
We look at what the standard is, we deconstruct it, we build the level of assessment and rigor we want the kids to get to, and we build daily assessments that build up to that formative assessment.

07:19:11.361 --> 07:19:16.924
That's our process, and then we have interim assessments throughout the year to make sure those skills haven't slipped.

07:19:17.344 --> 07:19:21.107
So it's the same for ELD, ELA, science, mathematics.

07:19:22.409 --> 07:19:23.950
Okay, that addresses my question.

07:19:23.991 --> 07:19:35.241
I'd like to, you can go ahead and sit down, and I wanna just make a statement, and I want my colleague, Member Holliday, to talk about what he's thinking about this school and the strengths he sees in it.

07:19:35.641 --> 07:19:38.484
I do wanna say that I have visited Gilroy Prep.

07:19:38.964 --> 07:19:48.013
I can't frankly remember what year it was, but it was about five years ago, and in fact, James Dent was the principal there,

07:19:49.253 --> 07:19:49.914
That was your title.

07:19:50.534 --> 07:20:09.665
And I was super impressed by what they were doing, their instructional model, the level of mastery that the teachers seemed to have in commitment to the instructional model, the way that the kids were kind of frequently working on basic skills and other things and assessing daily and then regrouping.

07:20:10.445 --> 07:20:18.329
And it was a very, very intentional and kind of a rapid iterative cycle of improvement for student and student learning all the time.

07:20:18.749 --> 07:20:21.370
And I was happy, and they were happy kids.

07:20:21.790 --> 07:20:29.574
So I already have a sense of what that school is like and their other schools are like, and we're super impressed with it.

07:20:30.014 --> 07:20:38.938
I'm also, I'll just say, super impressed with the fact that Navigator is offering professional development and curriculum to any takers

07:20:39.678 --> 07:20:40.959
that will take advantage of it.

07:20:41.079 --> 07:20:48.401
And I'm as impressed with the traditional districts who have taken advantage of it, because they sometimes don't do that with charter schools.

07:20:49.101 --> 07:20:52.202
Don't, you know, don't want to be seen as not knowing as much or whatever.

07:20:52.282 --> 07:21:04.746
And so I'm impressed with the fact that this is one of the things I think that the charter school law originally hoped would happen, is that there would be learning going back and forth between charter schools and traditional schools.

07:21:04.786 --> 07:21:06.407
So I'm really impressed with seeing that.

07:21:06.807 --> 07:21:10.268
So, that's all I've got at this moment and I'm hoping member Holiday will weigh in.

07:21:16.770 --> 07:21:17.591
Patricia Rucker.

07:21:19.511 --> 07:21:25.253
Well, I have questions for both the district and for the charter school sponsors.

07:21:25.853 --> 07:21:27.414
Could I start with the district first?

07:21:32.925 --> 07:21:44.513
Madam Superintendent, one of the things that I heard and only obliquely by a couple of people who spoke during the public comment was that this was a pro-charter, anti-charter debate.

07:21:44.914 --> 07:21:53.060
Do you feel that your opposition or your concern about approving this charter is based on your opposition to charters in general?

07:21:53.900 --> 07:21:55.561
Absolutely not.

07:21:55.821 --> 07:22:04.326
The people that know me, especially previously from Santa Ana Unified, know that most of what I learned actually was through charter schools.

07:22:04.786 --> 07:22:07.507
For me, I don't have political ambitions.

07:22:07.748 --> 07:22:09.308
I want to be a school superintendent.

07:22:09.689 --> 07:22:16.792
I'm not an elected official, so I have nothing but what I want to do for my students.

07:22:16.852 --> 07:22:21.455
For me, it is all about local control, which is why I actually had

07:22:22.015 --> 07:22:24.717
two of my dependent charters come and speak to you.

07:22:25.078 --> 07:22:41.231
So it has nothing to do with the fact that I don't think that students should have choice, nor the fact that I think that small learning communities that are doing something really unique is not a good thing, which is why I just started the Computer Science Immersion School.

07:22:42.252 --> 07:22:44.214
So for me, it has nothing to do with that.

07:22:44.614 --> 07:22:52.281
I don't know if you can tell from your slight interaction with me, but I know where I want to take the district and we're making great gains.

07:22:52.761 --> 07:22:55.063
My worry is I don't want to distract her.

07:22:55.604 --> 07:22:57.005
I want to continue to move forward.

07:22:57.185 --> 07:23:01.667
PVUSD, you talked about all the things that PVUSD is doing that are innovative.

07:23:01.987 --> 07:23:07.590
The other thing that you didn't talk about was your peer assistance and review and professional development for your teachers.

07:23:07.630 --> 07:23:12.933
You have been very innovative in that regard and have led the state in that way.

07:23:13.333 --> 07:23:20.457
How would you characterize the relationship you have with your current charter schools and the professional development activities

07:23:20.817 --> 07:23:24.601
that happens among the teachers in your current charter school?

07:23:24.621 --> 07:23:25.081
Sure.

07:23:25.101 --> 07:23:30.066
So, our four dependent charters, we're all integrated.

07:23:30.246 --> 07:23:33.229
So, we do what's called voice and choice PD.

07:23:33.249 --> 07:23:41.617
So, something that I find that's very important is just as we were talking about personalized learning, I believe that there should be personalized learning for teachers as well.

07:23:41.997 --> 07:23:51.025
So, I believe that there should be voice and choice, so teachers choose what they want to learn from a menu, and then they also choose a level of which they currently are.

07:23:51.746 --> 07:23:58.171
We just started that last year, so this is the second year that we're doing it, and we've got a lot of great feedback.

07:23:58.932 --> 07:24:04.857
We have a rigorous peer review assistance program, and we've been

07:24:06.638 --> 07:24:13.343
I mean, I will say that there probably wasn't a focus on having administrators in the classrooms until I got there.

07:24:13.824 --> 07:24:15.745
I'll just say that that is true.

07:24:16.166 --> 07:24:24.292
So now one thing that we're working with is rubrics, where we actually give constant feedback to teachers.

07:24:25.032 --> 07:24:31.940
My last question, I just want you to, and this is just so I can be clear about the issue of special populations.

07:24:33.602 --> 07:24:35.204
And it's okay to say I don't know.

07:24:35.604 --> 07:24:39.889
Off the top of your head, what is the percentage of the enrollment of migrant students in your district?

07:24:40.450 --> 07:24:41.891
So it does fluctuate.

07:24:41.951 --> 07:24:47.796
So one thing I will say is when you note, we do have a migrant camp that's right next to us.

07:24:47.836 --> 07:24:50.558
So we have Buena Vista, which is right next to us.

07:24:50.878 --> 07:24:52.700
Currently, right at this moment, it is 9%.

07:24:52.920 --> 07:24:56.163
It does fluctuate up and down.

07:24:57.103 --> 07:25:00.706
And in some schools, it's very centralized.

07:25:00.726 --> 07:25:05.230
So because of where they are, it's not all of our schools have the same

07:25:05.470 --> 07:25:11.813
And you do have population concentration of those students in some of the sites in your district.

07:25:12.113 --> 07:25:15.115
And then last but not least, you have a SELPA, your own SELPA, right?

07:25:16.095 --> 07:25:21.838
As far as it goes with issues of compliance for federal reporting purposes, do you have an issue with disproportionality?

07:25:22.758 --> 07:25:26.443
And what do you have, what is the plan you have for addressing that particular issue?

07:25:26.884 --> 07:25:29.687
So we do, we have a disproportionality issue.

07:25:29.727 --> 07:25:32.210
So we're close to 14% right now.

07:25:32.270 --> 07:25:38.278
So we start, we received a grant last year to begin MTSS implementation.

07:25:39.219 --> 07:25:43.644
And so we have, we had what was called their version of RTI.

07:25:43.944 --> 07:25:45.947
Now we have full MTSS.

07:25:47.288 --> 07:25:54.357
And I know I sound like a broken record, but we just started, we've made a lot of changes in the two years.

07:25:54.617 --> 07:26:08.849
Okay, and for anybody who doesn't know what I just asked, disproportionality is about the over-referral of particular types of students, particularly for California, it's about African-American males and particularly students with disabilities.

07:26:08.889 --> 07:26:13.232
So, I'm for students for referrals into programs to serve students with disabilities.

07:26:13.853 --> 07:26:18.797
Have you been able to reduce your disproportionality percentage or is that still a work in progress?

07:26:18.897 --> 07:26:36.131
It still is a work in progress, not because really the referrals at the older levels, but because we have had a significant increase of students at the preschool level that have been coming into the schools already with needing special education services from the regional center.

07:26:36.191 --> 07:26:37.572
OK, so thank you.

07:26:37.852 --> 07:26:40.935
Now I want to talk, I want to ask some questions to the charter school.

07:26:42.991 --> 07:26:47.795
I'm not particular who comes up and it's okay if you find you need to bring somebody else up.

07:26:47.836 --> 07:26:48.596
That's just fine.

07:26:49.651 --> 07:27:08.797
Okay, so let me just begin by saying I'm so happy that this is the last charter school hearing that we will all be hearing together as a group, because this is probably the most unique charter appeal I have heard in the entire time I've been on the board.

07:27:08.897 --> 07:27:13.059
Not unique because you're wonderful, but that didn't come out right.

07:27:15.086 --> 07:27:22.592
unique because it has encompassed every single issue we have ever argued about on this board concerning the appeal.

07:27:23.172 --> 07:27:23.813
I agree.

07:27:23.893 --> 07:27:33.801
The part of the reason I have always been concerned about appeals at this level is that the focus of this board has been on approving charters because our charge is to make sure

07:27:34.221 --> 07:27:41.986
We create access for students for a variety of innovative approaches, and the emphasis has been able to create and support that innovation.

07:27:42.386 --> 07:27:52.232
But my focus has always been on what serves the best, serves or addresses the best needs of the students based on what the Ed Code charges charter schools to do.

07:27:52.572 --> 07:28:00.897
This is the first charter I have ever seen in front of this board that actually has attempted to meet the challenge of being an innovative partner

07:28:01.437 --> 07:28:07.043
with the school to incubate ideas and innovation and to share those good practices with schools.

07:28:07.423 --> 07:28:09.886
So you have done that in your schools.

07:28:09.966 --> 07:28:16.373
You've made, and we've heard from teachers from other districts where your school is, where this practice is occurring.

07:28:16.753 --> 07:28:20.454
And those teachers have come here and testifying in support of your charter.

07:28:20.895 --> 07:28:32.419
So knowing that you have been a successful collaborating partner, can you explain to me why you believe PVUSD is not supportive of your charter?

07:28:37.551 --> 07:28:50.322
I would say that we heard it today in terms of impact on potential revenue, potential loss of staff and challenge with facilities.

07:28:50.422 --> 07:28:54.726
I think those are the three main reasons that they are not supportive.

07:28:57.051 --> 07:29:03.995
Okay, so can you, as it relates to the impact, revenue you can't, none of us have any control over revenue issues.

07:29:04.175 --> 07:29:07.097
All school districts have significant revenue issues.

07:29:07.858 --> 07:29:14.242
Impact on staff, I heard that also and I'm clear on, I believe what their concerns were.

07:29:14.622 --> 07:29:17.264
But I want to talk a little bit about the facilities issue.

07:29:18.428 --> 07:29:20.810
The school district is saying there's no facilities.

07:29:22.451 --> 07:29:24.672
I'm not going to ask you about how you're going to resolve that.

07:29:24.693 --> 07:29:39.983
I'm going to ask you instead of how do you believe the fact that the schools, that there is a facilities issue, how do you believe it's going to impact the students in your program and the students in the schools that are already in the district?

07:29:40.023 --> 07:29:40.804
How do you believe

07:29:41.224 --> 07:29:45.867
your presence will impact either positively or negatively those students.

07:29:46.367 --> 07:29:48.309
And I'll tell you the reason why I'm asking that.

07:29:48.789 --> 07:29:55.313
We had a charter school that was being collated on a school site that had several other programs.

07:29:55.714 --> 07:30:06.180
And there were multiple students who came and vehemently objected because they felt they were being pushed out of their own community school in favor of a new charter coming in.

07:30:06.541 --> 07:30:09.343
And they were very resentful of that issue.

07:30:10.343 --> 07:30:14.928
How do you believe, as a collaborating partner in this district, you can help address that?

07:30:16.329 --> 07:30:23.637
And I know I'm putting you on the spot, but this is important more to the students who will be impacted than the adults who are having the argument.

07:30:25.086 --> 07:30:28.650
Well, I appreciate the question and the opportunity to respond to it.

07:30:29.471 --> 07:30:33.415
Definitely facilities challenges are one of the trickiest.

07:30:33.875 --> 07:30:40.562
And we don't want that to be a barrier to forming a positive collaborative relationship with the Pajaro Valley Unified School District.

07:30:41.023 --> 07:30:46.589
And so we are being very aggressive in seeking long term facility solutions currently as we speak.

07:30:47.590 --> 07:31:00.320
Short term, we don't believe the six classrooms that we'll require for our program next year will have a significant impact based on what we've analyzed, based on the facility master plan that they've posted.

07:31:00.681 --> 07:31:01.962
So I know that they do have some

07:31:02.422 --> 07:31:03.563
issues at certain sites.

07:31:04.663 --> 07:31:12.768
We, in our Prop 39 request, stated the city boundaries of Watsonville, which gives them lots of options.

07:31:13.188 --> 07:31:18.091
So, we are confident that we'll get a fair offer for our facilities for the first year.

07:31:18.151 --> 07:31:24.274
But we're already thinking about years two, three, and four because we don't want that to be a long-term challenge.

07:31:24.699 --> 07:31:25.620
Okay.

07:31:25.740 --> 07:31:38.167
One of the SES issues that came up were the three types of students that were some of the lowest performing but also the most impacted or at-risk students, foster students, homeless students, and migrant students.

07:31:38.508 --> 07:31:50.415
Can you give me a summary about how the elements of your plan address services to or recruitment plans or strategies to support homeless or foster youth for your program in Watsonville?

07:31:51.280 --> 07:31:55.504
I'm going to ask Sharon Waller, Director of Student Services, to respond to that.

07:31:57.026 --> 07:32:00.329
She just went to a training on homeless and foster youth.

07:32:02.494 --> 07:32:05.955
I can assure you we're prepared to address the needs of those students.

07:32:06.015 --> 07:32:09.196
I believe the beauty of the MTSS model.

07:32:09.216 --> 07:32:11.437
I'm asking you to give me specific information.

07:32:11.477 --> 07:32:23.820
So we will be identifying the migrant students through working with the region partners and currently we provide students with their needs extended day.

07:32:23.840 --> 07:32:26.721
We have support for them during the school day.

07:32:27.941 --> 07:32:30.442
Anything those students need so that they're successful.

07:32:31.062 --> 07:32:39.248
In terms of the homeless, I'm the McKinney-Vento coordinator and we attended their conference.

07:32:39.308 --> 07:32:46.673
We attended that conference and we trained our office staff at both campuses in terms of what to look for.

07:32:47.113 --> 07:32:48.575
We've identified students that

07:32:49.395 --> 07:33:11.515
Heartbreakingly enough we didn't know we had and so now we're working with those families to see what their needs are We are anticipating that that is going to be a new Issue for us, but we're prepared to serve the needs of those students and our migrant students on back to that subject will have the right to return to our campus and we'll support them and

07:33:11.955 --> 07:33:21.286
When they're away from us, foster youth, similarly, under the McKinney-Vento, we are prepared to serve those students.

07:33:21.967 --> 07:33:28.094
Okay, and the superintendent did say that there's a large migrant community in the outskirts of their town.

07:33:28.194 --> 07:33:30.517
Can you tell me what you know about that migrant community?

07:33:31.263 --> 07:33:42.688
Well, I grew up in Aromas, which is eight miles from Watsonville, so I understand to a point that some of these kids will leave Watsonville and go to different places and work.

07:33:43.128 --> 07:33:52.492
They also go to the Ohlone campus that's down there in Pajaro, and they receive extra support.

07:33:52.592 --> 07:33:56.594
I know that Pajaro Valley has a wonderful migrant program that we'd be willing to

07:33:57.314 --> 07:34:18.977
Work with them to make sure our students get the same supports that those students get I Feel you know what my high dream would be to provide Tutorial in those places as well if they need that if they have mobility issues of you know if they can't get to our campuses safer tutorial programs so

07:34:19.898 --> 07:34:27.722
Okay, I'll be honest with you, I know, I believe you're very earnest, trying to be diligent, but even you know that wasn't really a good answer, right?

07:34:27.762 --> 07:34:28.562
Probably not.

07:34:28.622 --> 07:34:35.886
Yeah, and we're learning and we're trying to ensure that, you know, we'll meet the needs of the kids as they come to us.

07:34:35.926 --> 07:34:41.309
We're really good at analyzing our data and working with our families to understand what their needs are.

07:34:41.929 --> 07:34:47.814
But I think the bigger picture is collaborating with the Pearl Valley Migrant Program that is well developed.

07:34:47.854 --> 07:34:48.074
All right.

07:34:48.094 --> 07:34:49.255
This is my last question.

07:34:49.295 --> 07:34:52.537
Speaking of collaboration, where is your SELPA going to be?

07:34:53.538 --> 07:34:55.179
Eldorado County Charter SELPA.

07:34:55.559 --> 07:34:55.720
OK.

07:34:55.780 --> 07:35:01.004
So I know that's your choice and there are specific reasons why you've chosen the Eldorado SELPA.

07:35:01.044 --> 07:35:07.749
But again, in the interest of trying to create a more collaborative relationship with a district that's made it clear they don't want you,

07:35:08.209 --> 07:35:14.856
Wouldn't it make sense to think about collaborating with them in their SELPA for your program, for this particular program?

07:35:15.437 --> 07:35:19.180
And again, you know, you can say no because we have specific needs that are being met.

07:35:19.281 --> 07:35:28.150
I'm just wondering if the goal is to try to create a very collaborative relationship with a district that you already know you're going to have some difficulty with.

07:35:28.750 --> 07:35:31.293
This is an opportunity to create a nexus

07:35:31.696 --> 07:35:35.919
in your programs that would be in the best needs of the students you're trying to serve.

07:35:36.280 --> 07:35:37.741
Is that something you've considered?

07:35:40.563 --> 07:35:42.845
This doesn't impact the decision that will be made.

07:35:43.245 --> 07:35:55.154
I'm just concerned because, you know, the adults continue arguing and these things come down to who gets to win rather than what you're going to do to help the students in the community you say you want to serve.

07:35:55.515 --> 07:35:59.718
So if your goal is to be the type of successful collaborating partner

07:36:00.058 --> 07:36:10.544
that you seem to have been able to be in Hollister, you can't treat this community in the way, with the same kind of template of program you had in Hollister.

07:36:10.564 --> 07:36:12.766
There may have been something else you could have considered.

07:36:12.786 --> 07:36:17.008
So I just want to know, did you ever consider their SELPA?

07:36:17.128 --> 07:36:20.170
Not for provision of special education services, so no.

07:36:20.410 --> 07:36:21.351
Okay.

07:36:21.431 --> 07:36:24.232
And I appreciate you taking time to answer the questions that I asked.

07:36:24.292 --> 07:36:25.073
Thank you very much.

07:36:27.037 --> 07:36:29.680
Okay, Board Member Ortiz-Lacon.

07:36:32.682 --> 07:36:35.925
I know it's getting late, but I did want to thank everyone who came to speak.

07:36:35.986 --> 07:36:39.549
I know some of you referenced getting up at 4 in the morning to make the drive.

07:36:40.270 --> 07:36:46.596
Quiero agradecer a los padres y a la comunidad de Watsonville que ha venido a abogar por sus escuelas y por sus hijos.

07:36:47.416 --> 07:36:58.765
I think that every single time we have a charter school hearing, you know, we're reminded of how difficult these topics are because what I heard from Pajaro Unified is we're doing a lot.

07:36:59.045 --> 07:37:09.393
Look at all the innovation we have and you showed evidence and I looked in the dashboard and you've made increases in both math and ELA and so congratulations on that.

07:37:10.353 --> 07:37:16.937
I look at Gilroy and Hollister Prep, and honestly, I'm very impressed by what I see on the dashboard.

07:37:16.957 --> 07:37:26.503
And the first thing I do is I look at the dashboard and I go right down to the equity report, because there's often times where we see high-performing charter schools with a lot of internal achievement gaps.

07:37:27.144 --> 07:37:28.805
And I don't see those here.

07:37:29.725 --> 07:37:43.514
I know that there is perhaps some differences in those three populations, Gilroy, Watsonville, and Hollister, but I know that there's a lot of overlap, and the number one population are Latino students and English learners.

07:37:43.814 --> 07:37:45.875
I heard a lot of concerns about English learners.

07:37:46.255 --> 07:37:51.959
Again, as I see the results, I don't see those inequities within your English learners.

07:37:52.299 --> 07:38:00.624
However, I don't know how you're teasing out that data because there was mention of indigenous languages that may be spoken in Watsonville.

07:38:00.664 --> 07:38:02.566
So I do encourage you to look into that.

07:38:03.126 --> 07:38:07.629
But I think that some of the questions that came up are fair questions.

07:38:07.789 --> 07:38:10.351
How many charter schools can a district absorb?

07:38:11.591 --> 07:38:13.393
How does this impact us financially?

07:38:13.953 --> 07:38:14.914
What about facilities?

07:38:15.294 --> 07:38:25.140
Unfortunately, none of those questions can be relevant to us as we're looking at this review because as it stands in the law, they're beyond the scope of our consideration.

07:38:25.800 --> 07:38:27.381
Just wanted to state that, but thank you for coming.

07:38:28.622 --> 07:38:31.964
Yeah, I wanted to make some comments before that.

07:38:32.004 --> 07:38:33.826
I may have to leave before we vote.

07:38:33.866 --> 07:38:37.488
There's an event in my honor tonight.

07:38:38.488 --> 07:38:39.309
at 5 o'clock.

07:38:39.349 --> 07:38:43.753
So I did visit the Hollister Navigator School.

07:38:44.614 --> 07:38:48.057
Trish went to the Gilroy Navigator School, which is a different one.

07:38:49.077 --> 07:38:53.261
And you can't gain a whole lot from a morning at a school.

07:38:54.002 --> 07:38:56.204
But overall, I was impressed.

07:38:56.244 --> 07:38:59.527
Two things really stood out.

07:38:59.727 --> 07:39:02.970
One was the heavy use of technology for instruction.

07:39:04.271 --> 07:39:09.757
A lot of use of that in a way that I thought was very creative.

07:39:10.658 --> 07:39:19.467
And the biggest takeaway I had was the effectiveness of working with special ed students in a mainstream classroom.

07:39:20.008 --> 07:39:23.251
They used a model of four students.

07:39:24.112 --> 07:39:25.313
One was handicapped.

07:39:26.575 --> 07:39:31.019
I had a student with disability and the other students helped him.

07:39:31.099 --> 07:39:37.406
The teacher came in and the students with disability felt very comfortable.

07:39:37.866 --> 07:39:41.069
It was really interesting and I learned a lot from it.

07:39:42.691 --> 07:39:48.753
sort of scattered observations, but I did want to pass along some first-hand impressions.

07:39:49.433 --> 07:39:55.635
So if we don't, if I can't stay, I would do support this charter school.

07:39:55.755 --> 07:39:56.895
Now, who's next?

07:39:57.575 --> 07:39:58.295
Karen Valdez.

07:40:02.442 --> 07:40:21.968
So I agree with member Rucker this ham has had so many of the elements varied if you will but there's some really strong data on both the PD USD as well as the navigator And it sounds like PD USD under your direction superintendent Roger this has made some really good choices, and you're moving forward on

07:40:22.568 --> 07:40:28.032
I'm a little confused on the number of dependent charters that you have and just probably they didn't happen during your time.

07:40:28.072 --> 07:40:31.535
But my question is, it was by choice, correct?

07:40:31.595 --> 07:40:33.997
As a district, you made that choice to go with that.

07:40:34.017 --> 07:40:35.798
They're not conversion charters, correct?

07:40:37.151 --> 07:40:43.958
So, I was not present for the time, but it was in an effort to just provide additional choice.

07:40:44.038 --> 07:40:50.824
So, for instance, in Santa Ana Unified, I opened the first competency-based charter school in Orange County.

07:40:51.224 --> 07:41:00.013
So, a lot of times what a district will do will find a niche that they want to ensure that they can do, and then they move it forward.

07:41:00.373 --> 07:41:07.178
which is the reason why we are converting Freedom Elementary, for example, to another dual immersion school.

07:41:07.558 --> 07:41:14.043
So we have a dual immersion school, which is Alianza, that you heard from, that has an extremely long waiting list.

07:41:14.343 --> 07:41:20.768
So we're converting one grade level a year because you have to do that for dual immersion.

07:41:20.808 --> 07:41:23.169
I was a dual immersion teacher and administrator.

07:41:23.589 --> 07:41:26.932
So right now it's at first grade and we'll continue to move it up.

07:41:27.052 --> 07:41:29.654
Is that going to be a charter or that's just going to be a DI school?

07:41:30.054 --> 07:41:31.755
It's just, it's just a regular.

07:41:31.835 --> 07:41:42.078
And so I guess my concern is within the district is that teachers recognize that those dependent charters were historically put into place by choice by the district and that they are public schools.

07:41:42.138 --> 07:41:44.659
And so as we look at the competition of charter,

07:41:46.560 --> 07:41:49.522
the situation needs to have a positive spin, if you will.

07:41:49.542 --> 07:41:51.243
Do you understand where I'm going on that?

07:41:51.263 --> 07:42:00.591
And so that's just something that you in your leadership role are going to have to really help everyone understand the role and the decisions and where you are at this point in terms of your journey.

07:42:01.091 --> 07:42:05.255
I have a question for the Navigator School as well.

07:42:05.275 --> 07:42:08.337
Would I be able to make just one point on transportation?

07:42:08.938 --> 07:42:10.639
Would I be able to do that or no?

07:42:12.655 --> 07:42:15.636
It was in terms of the foster and the homeless question.

07:42:17.137 --> 07:42:17.337
Yeah.

07:42:17.737 --> 07:42:17.937
OK.

07:42:18.097 --> 07:42:18.377
OK.

07:42:19.318 --> 07:42:23.019
For Navigator, I noticed that you are interested in doing early intervention.

07:42:23.059 --> 07:42:26.020
You talked about some preschool kind of transition.

07:42:26.100 --> 07:42:27.341
But are you offering TK?

07:42:27.401 --> 07:42:33.043
Because I think I saw it a couple of different places that if we wanted you to do TK, you would do that.

07:42:33.443 --> 07:42:34.643
Is that the recommendation?

07:42:35.584 --> 07:42:38.645
Or are you taking that sort of I'm not going to do TK approach?

07:42:39.455 --> 07:42:43.896
No, as we put in our charter petition, we will do TK if it's required by the authorizer.

07:42:44.016 --> 07:42:49.277
The way we interpret the Ed Code is that you're only required to do TK if you accept the funding.

07:42:49.297 --> 07:42:53.658
But we know that the state board in the past has required TK.

07:42:53.718 --> 07:43:02.340
So, we wanted to make sure that whether it was the county, the district or the state board, we're perfectly ready and willing to do transitional kindergarten if that's required.

07:43:02.600 --> 07:43:06.565
Okay, I just want it on record that my recommendation is to have TK as part of their program.

07:43:06.585 --> 07:43:08.226
Okay, if it's approved.

07:43:09.228 --> 07:43:10.409
Okay, board member Holliday.

07:43:10.569 --> 07:43:13.512
Thank you to all my fellow board members for all your questions and comments.

07:43:13.593 --> 07:43:16.135
And I think you hit upon almost everything that I would have said.

07:43:16.256 --> 07:43:17.036
I do want to repeat

07:43:17.757 --> 07:43:31.605
What many of you said about Superintendent Rodriguez and the great work that you're doing in your district, we know how difficult a challenge you've had and your staff and everyone there.

07:43:31.885 --> 07:43:35.907
And we're really proud of the work that you're doing there and keep it up.

07:43:36.268 --> 07:43:36.988
You're doing great work.

07:43:37.677 --> 07:43:54.148
That being said, Navigator provides an opportunity here to have a charter school that does meet all the requirements that the ACCS, that the CDE, and that even the county have recommended, not the board, but the county staff.

07:43:55.228 --> 07:44:09.251
In addition to that, we know that this is really an exciting opportunity for collaboration, which we've seen proved by the other schools, and we've not seen that in many of the charter schools.

07:44:10.011 --> 07:44:12.332
I would move the staff recommendation.

07:44:13.112 --> 07:44:13.592
I second.

07:44:14.712 --> 07:44:19.513
Okay, and the Ting and then the State Superintendent.

07:44:20.970 --> 07:44:29.133
Yeah, I'm just, I know, being a little bit redundant at this point in time as well, but I had not heard much about, known much about Navigator Schools.

07:44:29.514 --> 07:44:33.415
Very impressed with the data and very impressed with the staff who came and presented today.

07:44:33.435 --> 07:44:42.319
I know the concern about having some of these cookie cutter charter programs that just drop into the middle of a district and a geography.

07:44:43.039 --> 07:44:52.326
And I do have the confidence that this group understands the needs of that particular community and is willing to work towards that.

07:44:52.827 --> 07:44:59.672
And then on the part about the partnership, again, that is, I'm so impressed around that.

07:44:59.692 --> 07:45:04.195
You know, I know that Kevin, kudos to you.

07:45:04.615 --> 07:45:12.161
He's been with the Chartered Schools Movement since the very, very beginning and really understands the impetus and the reason behind the Chartered Schools Act.

07:45:12.621 --> 07:45:15.142
So that piece of the collaboration.

07:45:15.202 --> 07:45:17.903
But that said, collaboration takes both sides.

07:45:18.143 --> 07:45:29.206
And so if there is a hand that's extended to offer this, I am hoping that the contention that's been happening at the local district, that that hand is not slapped.

07:45:29.406 --> 07:45:35.408
Because I think it does not help all of the students if there isn't that collaboration after this vote.

07:45:37.409 --> 07:45:38.169
Patricia Rucker.

07:45:38.996 --> 07:45:39.376
I'm sorry.

07:45:39.496 --> 07:45:41.918
I had a question I was hoping that Bruce would address.

07:45:42.399 --> 07:45:46.081
It's concerning the advisory that came from the Attorney General's office.

07:45:46.161 --> 07:45:51.125
I was confused by what the charter sponsor said that they were going to do.

07:45:51.746 --> 07:45:56.349
Was there a condition given to them on how they were going to address government code 1090?

07:45:56.709 --> 07:46:00.752
Or did they just simply say they would agree to do whatever it is they were asked?

07:46:01.193 --> 07:46:04.095
That is not one of the conditions from the CD recommendation.

07:46:04.491 --> 07:46:05.892
Okay, I just want to make sure I understand.

07:46:05.952 --> 07:46:07.133
So what did they say?

07:46:07.193 --> 07:46:09.715
Did they say that they were going to do it or did they say they wanted to?

07:46:09.795 --> 07:46:11.896
I think the council ought to address this.

07:46:11.996 --> 07:46:13.337
That's not what my question was.

07:46:13.437 --> 07:46:22.764
I want to know what did the, did they, did the sponsor say they would do what the Attorney General advised or did they say they would do whatever we asked them to do?

07:46:23.084 --> 07:46:31.190
I wasn't clear and I was hoping Bruce could explain that because I didn't want to put them on the spot to have to answer that question because that sounded like a legalistic question.

07:46:31.210 --> 07:46:33.372
So I just want to be clear on what was done.

07:46:34.949 --> 07:46:39.621
I just want to know how they responded because they said something in response to the Attorney General's advisory.

07:46:39.942 --> 07:46:42.368
I wanted to make sure I was clear on what they said they wanted to.

07:46:42.822 --> 07:46:47.703
So at ACCS, we didn't have the AG's opinion at that time.

07:46:48.124 --> 07:46:51.405
So we didn't actually discuss it at the Advisory Commission meeting.

07:46:51.745 --> 07:46:53.185
So we are looking at it now.

07:46:54.405 --> 07:46:57.326
And how it will, it's because it's not in the petition.

07:46:57.426 --> 07:47:03.648
They did actually state in the petition that they would comply with the PFA, the

07:47:06.989 --> 07:47:08.090
Political Reform Act.

07:47:08.170 --> 07:47:08.571
Thank you.

07:47:08.791 --> 07:47:09.912
The Political Reform Act.

07:47:10.032 --> 07:47:17.980
And we are looking at it internally as to how we, if we need to make changes to the MOU that the State Board has with our schools.

07:47:18.561 --> 07:47:23.426
So we are looking at that, but it... No.

07:47:24.247 --> 07:47:24.427
No.

07:47:24.447 --> 07:47:27.050
I was hoping you would clarify that.

07:47:27.250 --> 07:47:28.751
Okay.

07:47:29.372 --> 07:47:30.233
State Superintendent.

07:47:33.840 --> 07:47:49.314
Thank you, Mr. President, and while we have staff present, I think that the board and the public comment participants have debated just about every side of the argument about whether or not to support the petitioner's appeal.

07:47:49.875 --> 07:47:52.057
There is one resource question that has not been addressed.

07:47:52.117 --> 07:47:55.360
I'd like for staff at the Department of Education to clarify

07:47:56.060 --> 07:48:02.805
the number of charter schools that are currently under state oversight.

07:48:02.905 --> 07:48:14.773
Because should the board choose to approve the petitioner's appeal, that would make the California Department of Education responsible for providing that oversight.

07:48:14.813 --> 07:48:15.894
And my understanding is that

07:48:16.454 --> 07:48:19.437
That is a very thin resource for a very large number of schools.

07:48:20.118 --> 07:48:36.614
And regardless of where anyone is on these issues, it is a fact that must be considered in relation to this school and in relation to the larger conversation taking place in the state of California right now about whether or not the state should or should not authorize charter schools.

07:48:37.314 --> 07:48:39.797
Would you please clarify the number of charter schools currently

07:48:40.478 --> 07:48:52.414
under state oversight and what would be the resources provided for the Department of Education to oversee this school should the board approve this petition.

07:48:53.137 --> 07:49:00.627
We currently have 33, and one of those being High Tech High, who's our statewide, that has six sites.

07:49:01.168 --> 07:49:02.169
So we consider that 39.

07:49:03.851 --> 07:49:04.973
With this school, we'll be at 40.

07:49:06.094 --> 07:49:10.240
And we have three staff members that provide oversight to those 40 schools.

07:49:11.241 --> 07:49:13.242
So we have very limited resources.

07:49:13.963 --> 07:49:19.246
It is difficult to provide oversight across the state when we're in Sacramento.

07:49:20.067 --> 07:49:21.187
So it is difficult.

07:49:21.548 --> 07:49:25.890
And we have put processes in place to do the best job we can.

07:49:26.851 --> 07:49:33.375
But we are very limited and don't feel like we provide enough oversight.

07:49:33.415 --> 07:49:34.135
We could do more.

07:49:34.536 --> 07:49:36.897
But at this point with 40 schools, we do what we can.

07:49:36.917 --> 07:49:40.099
Go ahead.

07:49:42.346 --> 07:49:45.248
I think that's a very important point, Superintendent Thurman.

07:49:45.348 --> 07:49:55.894
And actually, when I first came to the board eight years ago, I was shocked that the state board was the second largest authorizer of charters in the state, right behind LA Unified.

07:49:56.294 --> 07:50:00.356
But it's kind of how things have gone, right, in terms of appeals.

07:50:00.416 --> 07:50:02.097
We've actually got it down, which is great.

07:50:02.697 --> 07:50:11.022
But one thing I wanted to mention is the original charter law allowed for oversight of state approved charters to be assigned back to counties.

07:50:11.602 --> 07:50:19.405
For the very reason that lisa just articulated it's much easier and much more effective in my view Not to slight what's going on up here.

07:50:19.445 --> 07:50:25.567
They just know the community's better as you know to do that We haven't really pursued that in any strong way.

07:50:25.667 --> 07:50:33.690
So it's just it's an option that I think we should all really look at Okay, we're ready for the motion from

07:50:35.826 --> 07:50:36.486
We have a second.

07:50:37.567 --> 07:50:38.867
Any further board discussion?

07:50:38.887 --> 07:50:41.028
Okay, clerk, call the roll.

07:50:45.071 --> 07:50:45.491
Super.

07:50:45.991 --> 07:50:46.111
Aye.

07:50:53.475 --> 07:50:53.575
Aye.

07:50:54.455 --> 07:50:55.476

Aye.

07:50:56.777 --> 07:50:57.537
Patricia Rucker.

07:50:57.737 --> 07:50:59.118
Not voting.

07:50:59.138 --> 07:50:59.218
Okay.

07:51:02.026 --> 07:51:02.846
Nikki Sandoval.

07:51:03.126 --> 07:51:03.206
Aye.

07:51:03.947 --> 07:51:04.728
Eileen Strauss.

07:51:05.128 --> 07:51:05.208
Aye.

07:51:05.989 --> 07:51:06.549
Ting Sung.

07:51:06.569 --> 07:51:07.170
Aye.

07:51:07.870 --> 07:51:08.371
Erin Valdez.

07:51:08.411 --> 07:51:08.511
Aye.

07:51:09.392 --> 07:51:10.012
Trish Williams.

07:51:11.614 --> 07:51:11.754
Aye.

07:51:11.794 --> 07:51:12.134
And it passes.

07:51:12.194 --> 07:51:15.217
It carries though, so the charter school petition is approved.

07:51:19.260 --> 07:51:19.700
Okay.

07:51:19.800 --> 07:51:26.206
So we need to take a five minute break and then we... We need to do some set ups.

07:51:26.266 --> 07:51:28.107
We need a five minute break before item 20.

07:51:28.428 --> 07:51:28.688
Okay.

07:51:29.301 --> 07:51:34.925
We'll take a break before item 20 and reconvene at 10 of 5.

07:51:47.975 --> 07:51:48.956
Hello, everybody.

07:51:49.597 --> 07:51:51.138
Welcome to our board meeting.

07:51:51.158 --> 07:51:58.183
Hello, everybody.

07:51:58.203 --> 07:51:58.604
Welcome.

07:52:10.447 --> 07:52:10.807
Hello.

07:52:12.127 --> 07:52:14.188
Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome.

07:52:19.810 --> 07:52:23.852
We are so glad to have you all here today, or almost this evening.

07:52:24.772 --> 07:52:25.293
So thank you.

07:52:27.572 --> 07:52:36.762
President Kirst has gone to his reception, which in honor of his retirement, so I'm Eileen Strauss, the vice president, and I'll be facilitating.

07:52:37.403 --> 07:52:45.372
We are on item 20, the appointment of Lupita Cortez-Ocala to chief deputy superintendent of public instruction in accordance with article...

07:52:48.760 --> 07:52:53.143
Article 9, Section 2.1 of the Constitution of the State of California.

07:52:53.163 --> 07:52:59.267
And for this, I'm turning it over to Superintendent Thurmond to present.

07:53:02.209 --> 07:53:03.871
Thank you, Madam Vice President, Madam Chair.

07:53:03.891 --> 07:53:04.431
Good evening.

07:53:05.652 --> 07:53:06.392
Good evening.

07:53:06.412 --> 07:53:08.234
Buenas noches.

07:53:09.434 --> 07:53:11.056
This is a celebration.

07:53:11.776 --> 07:53:13.157
Thank you for being here.

07:53:13.758 --> 07:53:19.383
Thank you to the members of the board for this opportunity to introduce an incredible champion.

07:53:19.684 --> 07:53:20.945
We are gathered here today.

07:53:21.045 --> 07:53:21.645
Oh, wrong speech.

07:53:21.685 --> 07:53:21.946
Sorry.

07:53:24.313 --> 07:53:49.900
It is truly an honor to introduce a great leader for the state of California, a longtime leader at the California Department of Education who has come home to serve at the California Department of Education, someone who knows the needs, the opportunities, the challenges, and the culture of this place, which is a very unique institution.

07:53:50.841 --> 07:54:01.668
Lupita also brings with her an incredible understanding of higher education in addition to her experience in early education and K-12 education.

07:54:02.168 --> 07:54:13.415
Recognizing that education is a continuum from early education to higher education, this brings us a great opportunity to support the students in the great state of California.

07:54:15.336 --> 07:54:19.018
Lupita, as you will soon see if you don't know,

07:54:19.756 --> 07:54:25.777
is a passionate and intense leader for making change and positive change for all of our students.

07:54:26.537 --> 07:54:48.142
Her passion is informed by her own experiences as a student, as an English learner, as a student who was often mistreated and mischaracterized, but who persevered to go to the highest levels of education in this state and in this nation, a graduate of Harvard University.

07:54:49.502 --> 07:54:53.026
The daughter of immigrants, that deserves a round of applause.

07:54:54.968 --> 07:55:07.581
The daughter of immigrants who've contributed to this great state, who sacrificed for their family and have created these opportunities for her and her siblings and her children and others who are here.

07:55:08.377 --> 07:55:12.260
I met Lupita, I thought it was an accident that we met.

07:55:13.001 --> 07:55:14.042
I think it was her plan.

07:55:15.983 --> 07:55:34.879
I met Lupita as an assembly member and as a candidate for this office, and she helped us deliver an incredible hearing on the importance of creating science, technology, engineering, arts, and math opportunities for girls and women and students of color.

07:55:35.619 --> 07:55:41.462
And we kept having these meetings to talk about STEAM and to talk about helping kids.

07:55:41.962 --> 07:55:48.466
And then one day I heard her say this thing that I'm sure she's said a million times, you know I worked at CDE for 12 years.

07:55:49.486 --> 07:55:52.268
And then it was like a light bulb went off in that moment.

07:55:54.059 --> 07:56:03.625
Even while I was struggling through the campaign, I had the opportunity to think and evaluate, should I have the good fortune to serve in this capacity?

07:56:04.166 --> 07:56:09.289
Who might be the right partner to help us at the California Department of Education?

07:56:09.690 --> 07:56:16.094
I'm pleased to tell you, I never considered anyone else but Lupita Cortez-Alcala.

07:56:23.346 --> 07:56:28.815
Lupita has some folks who've come here from a long way and some from a long time.

07:56:29.355 --> 07:56:34.844
I understand that she has teachers here who are her teachers in second and third grade.

07:56:35.985 --> 07:56:37.247
So you understand.

07:56:37.307 --> 07:56:38.589
Let's give them a round of applause.

07:56:41.289 --> 07:56:42.770
She will acknowledge them, I'm sure.

07:56:42.790 --> 07:56:48.813
So you understand how important education is to her, her family, her extended community.

07:56:49.113 --> 07:56:54.175
Her family is here, and they are here to help her in her special celebration.

07:56:54.536 --> 07:56:56.317
Her husband, William, who is here.

07:56:59.738 --> 07:57:02.940
Her children, William and Olivia, are here.

07:57:07.455 --> 07:57:13.541
Her parents, Candelaria and Raul Cortez, are here, all the way from Poway.

07:57:17.806 --> 07:57:19.507
Bienvenidos y gracias para venir.

07:57:20.869 --> 07:57:23.752
Her sister, all the way from Arizona, is here.

07:57:24.212 --> 07:57:28.517
Mariana Cortez, all the way from Arizona, is here.

07:57:30.805 --> 07:57:40.559
So as we swear Lupita in, in the presence of her family, know that now you are part of her extended family in education.

07:57:41.300 --> 07:57:44.104
These jobs are not easy, and we do not do them alone.

07:57:44.696 --> 07:57:48.280
We do them with those who care for us and support us.

07:57:48.740 --> 07:57:58.770
So as we swear in Lupita, we're swearing you in, too, to be her support circle and supporting her and supporting six million students in the great state of California.

07:57:58.790 --> 07:58:01.813
I present to you Lupita Cortez Alcala.

07:58:08.149 --> 07:58:19.614
Who, by the way, in addition to being a great leader, makes history as the first ever Latina to be appointed as the Chief Deputy Superintendent of California.

07:58:23.416 --> 07:58:27.458
If you would, Lupita, we would love for you and your family to please approach.

07:58:30.559 --> 07:58:31.160
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:58:32.674 --> 07:58:35.395
Never one to rest on ceremony, I skipped the vote.

07:58:36.055 --> 07:58:40.737
Let's let the board do what they must do.

07:58:40.797 --> 07:58:41.758
Okay, we'll do our approval.

07:58:42.138 --> 07:58:43.038
Okay, Feliza?

07:58:43.838 --> 07:58:46.219
Motion to move the department's recommendation.

07:58:47.700 --> 07:58:48.040
Okay.

07:58:50.861 --> 07:58:56.303
All those in favor of supporting the department's recommendation, raise your hand, vote aye.

07:58:57.203 --> 07:58:57.704
We approve.

07:59:04.952 --> 07:59:06.813
I'm sorry, it's only my third day on the job.

07:59:06.833 --> 07:59:23.577
I'm going to be down here and you're going to be up here.

07:59:23.697 --> 07:59:31.139
You can stand with them and face the audience.

07:59:40.953 --> 07:59:43.594
Let's give them another round of applause as they come, ladies and gentlemen.

07:59:58.959 --> 08:00:01.320
If you would, please raise your right hand and repeat after me.

08:00:02.560 --> 08:00:03.421
I, state your name.

08:00:03.441 --> 08:00:04.381
I, Lupita Cortez Alcala.

08:00:05.781 --> 08:00:07.462
Do solemnly swear or affirm.

08:00:10.063 --> 08:00:35.505
that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the United States

08:00:38.032 --> 08:01:01.698
and the Constitution of the State of California, that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which I'm about to enter.

08:01:04.539 --> 08:01:05.419
Congratulations.

08:01:28.088 --> 08:01:30.509
Do you want to take some photos?

08:01:32.991 --> 08:01:37.553
Okay.

08:01:51.161 --> 08:01:54.844
Thank you, Superintendent Thurmond.

08:01:54.884 --> 08:01:55.284
Can you hear me?

08:01:56.903 --> 08:02:01.545
for giving me the honor of swearing me in and for your kind words.

08:02:02.806 --> 08:02:07.968
Vice President Aileen Strauss and board members for your vote of confidence.

08:02:08.308 --> 08:02:12.270
So I appreciate that and thank you all for being here today.

08:02:12.930 --> 08:02:18.272
Some of you as far as Boston and Arizona and Poway and Los Angeles.

08:02:18.753 --> 08:02:19.453
I appreciate

08:02:20.154 --> 08:02:28.024
And seeing all of your faces, I'm reminded of the impact that you had on my life, both personally and professionally.

08:02:28.044 --> 08:02:35.113
I first want to thank, quiero dar las gracias a mis padres, Raul y Candelaria.

08:02:41.714 --> 08:02:49.519
They have given me the motivation to be where I am today.

08:02:50.700 --> 08:02:51.621
I wanted to honor them.

08:02:52.361 --> 08:02:57.745
Yo quería honrarlos a ellos por sus esfuerzos y sus sacrificios en nuestras vidas.

08:02:58.065 --> 08:03:01.827
And so I wanted to honor them and my family for their sacrifices.

08:03:02.328 --> 08:03:04.229
We immigrated from Mexico when I was three.

08:03:04.990 --> 08:03:08.312
My mom sacrificed her education and her life to support us.

08:03:09.092 --> 08:03:21.061
and my dad showed us a great work ethic and strong traditional Mexican values and their importance of education and doing the very best.

08:03:21.742 --> 08:03:32.570
While they couldn't help me navigate the educational system, they put us in an awesome, fantastic public school system, Poway Unified and Saddleback Unified.

08:03:33.211 --> 08:03:36.994
And my teacher, second and third grade teacher, Mrs. Peterson is here today.

08:03:38.455 --> 08:03:51.985
And she was a great motivation in my life because I knew that she supported me, she loved me, and she didn't just love me, she loved my family while we were learning English and navigating the system.

08:03:53.126 --> 08:03:55.668
And so thank you for being here and all your support.

08:03:55.848 --> 08:04:02.593
I don't know that throughout the years you've known how much you've influenced me and how much I appreciated what you did for me.

08:04:02.613 --> 08:04:05.255
Thank you.

08:04:13.095 --> 08:04:16.598
In the last 20 years, I've been here in Sacramento.

08:04:16.978 --> 08:04:19.680
I knew one person, and that one person, Diane, is here today.

08:04:20.941 --> 08:04:24.503
The rest of you have become my family and my colleagues.

08:04:25.224 --> 08:04:28.446
And I married a local, and that is William.

08:04:29.247 --> 08:04:31.869
And these are my two kids, Olivia and William.

08:04:32.769 --> 08:04:41.136
And my mother-in-law and father-in-law, I'm married into a wonderful family, and I'm not able to do what I'm able to do, but for their support.

08:04:41.716 --> 08:04:49.222
So I want to thank you for your patience and for your love and your unconditional support.

08:04:49.362 --> 08:04:49.923
So thank you.

08:04:57.748 --> 08:05:04.559
I also invited you all here today from the many positions I've had here.

08:05:04.799 --> 08:05:12.351
I've worked with California School Boards Association and Davis Campbell is here today and he was one of my first bosses along with Kevin Gordon.

08:05:18.720 --> 08:05:21.061
And he gave me my first shot here in Sacramento.

08:05:21.261 --> 08:05:22.361
I was 25 years old.

08:05:23.382 --> 08:05:28.983
And what I've always told everyone is I've gotten to where I am because I've had incredible bosses.

08:05:29.484 --> 08:05:30.984
And they've given me opportunities.

08:05:31.104 --> 08:05:32.945
And it almost doesn't matter what you do.

08:05:33.105 --> 08:05:36.266
It matters who you work for and the opportunities they afford you.

08:05:37.226 --> 08:05:42.409
Also from my experience at the governor's office, I worked for Linda Adams and Ann Richardson.

08:05:42.429 --> 08:05:44.190
I see Ann Richardson here today.

08:05:44.210 --> 08:05:49.572
And they were also incredible bosses and gave me incredible opportunities.

08:05:50.152 --> 08:05:59.057
Here at the Department of Education, oh, and I forget, at the School Boards Association, Rick Pratt is here as well, and he was an incredible boss.

08:05:59.797 --> 08:06:00.637
And I see him.

08:06:01.818 --> 08:06:03.719
Raise your hand, right here, over here to the right.

08:06:03.739 --> 08:06:07.482
So thank you, Rick, for all your support.

08:06:09.283 --> 08:06:14.886
The Department of Education, I came here not because, interestingly, in Ayodhya, I adore him, Jack O'Connell.

08:06:14.946 --> 08:06:16.527
It was because Terry Burns.

08:06:16.787 --> 08:06:18.548
I had heard she was a great boss.

08:06:19.029 --> 08:06:19.929
Where are you, Terry Burns?

08:06:21.230 --> 08:06:21.730
Thank you.

08:06:23.451 --> 08:06:24.352
And she is.

08:06:24.812 --> 08:06:25.573
And she was.

08:06:25.593 --> 08:06:28.114
And congratulations to you and your retirement.

08:06:29.560 --> 08:06:33.942
And I've had an opportunity to work with Rich Zeiger, who is the chief of staff, and he's here today, too.

08:06:36.783 --> 08:06:41.265
Gavin Payne, Jack and both Tom Torlakson.

08:06:42.205 --> 08:06:47.928
And at the Student Aid Commission, I had my very first commissioner boss, Hal Geoghe, is here today.

08:06:52.953 --> 08:07:04.017
All these people that I mentioned have given me the opportunity and the experience and the portfolio of issue areas and had the confidence in me.

08:07:04.637 --> 08:07:18.922
But many of you here, I've worked with you in the Assembly, in the Senate, Department of Finance, the Governor's Office, many really good friends, and you've helped me be and do the things I've been able to do because I haven't done it alone.

08:07:19.282 --> 08:07:21.303
And I wanted to recognize and thank you

08:07:22.163 --> 08:07:27.185
Another commissioner I'm seeing here too is Catalina C. Fuentes, who's come all the way from Riverside.

08:07:27.205 --> 08:07:39.971
And if I have an amazing resume, it's because of all of you that have worked with me to get to this point.

08:07:40.031 --> 08:07:42.812
The Student Aid Commission, we have many of the deputies that are here.

08:07:42.852 --> 08:07:43.553
Raise your hand.

08:07:45.374 --> 08:07:47.234
And you've allowed me to do a lot of the work.

08:07:47.675 --> 08:07:48.555
Some of you are standing.

08:07:52.315 --> 08:07:59.081
But I invited you here today not by accident, but because I wanted to thank you from the bottom of my heart for supporting me all these years.

08:07:59.661 --> 08:08:05.547
I would not be where I am today without you, but I also wanted to call you because this is a call to action.

08:08:06.948 --> 08:08:08.049
I can't do this without you.

08:08:08.529 --> 08:08:19.079
As I take this new role on, I know that it's going to require your counsel, your continued support, the sharing of ideas, the breaking down of inefficient systems, and of course the building of new ones.

08:08:20.299 --> 08:08:43.254
It's going to require a lot of innovation and grit and both urgency and patience because ensuring that all the students and children of California have both an equal opportunity and equal access to the best education they deserve, especially English learners, immigrant children, underrepresented students, we absolutely have to do something about closing the achievement gap.

08:08:44.334 --> 08:08:45.215
And we're gonna require

08:08:50.925 --> 08:08:59.475
And it's going to require partnerships and collaborations because I and Superintendent Thurman, we represent the faces of California today.

08:08:59.495 --> 08:09:04.921
And it's no accident that I am the first Latina Chief Deputy Superintendent.

08:09:06.323 --> 08:09:07.664
And it's a long time in coming.

08:09:14.244 --> 08:09:16.545
But I also have an immigrant experience.

08:09:16.745 --> 08:09:17.805
I'm an English learner.

08:09:18.665 --> 08:09:22.127
And it's this family right here that have sacrificed a lot.

08:09:22.167 --> 08:09:30.109
And many families in California, they may not be able to do too much, but they entrust us, the children, to our California public schools.

08:09:30.229 --> 08:09:33.410
And they expect us to give them a high quality education.

08:09:33.671 --> 08:09:34.811
And that's what we intend to do.

08:09:42.642 --> 08:09:44.863
So as you know, I'm not your ordinary chief deputy.

08:09:47.044 --> 08:09:48.145
I'm going to be straightforward.

08:09:48.165 --> 08:09:52.047
I'm going to be honest, because there's too much at stake to do otherwise.

08:09:52.948 --> 08:09:54.589
I'm excited about this opportunity.

08:09:54.609 --> 08:10:01.333
And I'm going to end with a quote that was texted to me before she arrived, Catalina C. Fuentes.

08:10:02.353 --> 08:10:07.914
It's a quote by Cesar Chavez, and it says, once social change begins, it cannot be reversed.

08:10:07.954 --> 08:10:11.135
You cannot uneducate the person who has learned to read.

08:10:11.235 --> 08:10:14.416
You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride.

08:10:14.476 --> 08:10:18.036
And you cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore.

08:10:18.236 --> 08:10:26.138
So I want to thank State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurman for giving me the opportunity to join him on this journey.

08:10:26.718 --> 08:10:32.961
and for entrusting me with the awesome responsibility of improving the quality of California's education system.

08:10:33.401 --> 08:10:42.586
And not only with all of you, but with all of the California Department of Education staff and team that I truly care about and that I truly respect.

08:10:43.046 --> 08:10:44.927
And together we will move mountains.

08:10:45.608 --> 08:10:46.148
So thank you.

08:10:46.168 --> 08:10:49.650
Thank you.

08:10:50.410 --> 08:10:50.770
Thank you.

08:10:56.053 --> 08:10:56.293
Thank you.

08:11:08.902 --> 08:11:18.966
So procedurally now, I just want to tell you, Lupita, on behalf of the board, it's so great for those of us who've worked with you before to have you come back with us again.

08:11:19.586 --> 08:11:23.128
And you bring such amazing experience to our team.

08:11:23.148 --> 08:11:29.791
I know the board may have a few comments, and I think there's probably a few people that want to make some public comments.

08:11:30.171 --> 08:11:31.692
Do you want to take some pictures first?

08:11:32.972 --> 08:11:34.433
Would you like to take a few pictures?

08:11:34.453 --> 08:11:39.275
I'll go take a couple pictures and then we'll ask for board comments if anybody wants to make a comment.

08:11:40.756 --> 08:11:44.678
You want to take some photos and then we'll have an opportunity for public comments.

08:12:03.933 --> 08:12:04.373
We're at the end.

08:12:05.514 --> 08:12:11.236
Okay, I'll ask the board to come back.

08:12:11.256 --> 08:12:17.919
I know we have several receptions to honor.

08:12:17.939 --> 08:12:27.003
Do you want to say anything or not?

08:12:27.123 --> 08:12:32.986
I know, but do we want public comment?

08:12:39.245 --> 08:12:46.410
We can do it quickly all right um we're gonna make a couple of comments on behalf of the board before Okay

08:13:00.376 --> 08:13:02.057
So I want to thank everybody for coming.

08:13:02.558 --> 08:13:10.143
Lupita, on behalf of the board, we are so excited to be working with you and to be renewing our relationships and with the hard work.

08:13:10.183 --> 08:13:12.544
And I know a couple board members have a few quick comments.

08:13:12.924 --> 08:13:14.746
We'll ask for a few public comments.

08:13:14.786 --> 08:13:17.688
I know there's a reception for you where you'll hear from lots of people.

08:13:18.128 --> 08:13:20.790
And I know Mike is waiting for us on the reception for him.

08:13:20.870 --> 08:13:22.491
So Felicia.

08:13:27.282 --> 08:13:30.483
I want to congratulate Lupita's family.

08:13:30.503 --> 08:13:34.424
I just want to say that, one, we're celebrating an educator.

08:13:34.824 --> 08:13:36.204
You have a very impressive resume.

08:13:36.224 --> 08:13:39.025
We all got to see it and review it in our agenda items.

08:13:39.485 --> 08:13:45.527
But on a personal note, I do think that it's not lost in me how historic today is.

08:13:45.587 --> 08:13:51.609
This whole week, actually, we have elected the first Afro-Latino to the state superintendent position.

08:13:55.970 --> 08:13:59.692
You know, I know everyone would say, well, African-American and the mother was Panamanian.

08:13:59.732 --> 08:14:01.313
I'm like, yeah, that's Afro-Latino.

08:14:01.333 --> 08:14:04.315
And I think it shows the diversity in our community.

08:14:05.496 --> 08:14:08.658
The Afro-Latinos are widely underrepresented in the Latino community.

08:14:08.678 --> 08:14:15.442
I think it's important for students to see the diversity in our community, but also see that the state superintendent reflects them.

08:14:16.022 --> 08:14:18.803
and the first Latina to this role.

08:14:19.263 --> 08:14:22.444
And, you know, so I think that this is what our parents dream.

08:14:22.664 --> 08:14:25.185
This is a dream deferred materialized into reality.

08:14:25.645 --> 08:14:27.166
And I'm so happy for you.

08:14:27.186 --> 08:14:28.446
I'm so happy for your family.

08:14:28.486 --> 08:14:33.308
I couldn't help but seeing their expressions and seeing how proud they were and how emotional this day is.

08:14:33.848 --> 08:14:35.309
And so congratulations.

08:14:35.349 --> 08:14:37.830
I look forward to working closely with you the year to come.

08:14:38.030 --> 08:14:38.250
Thanks.

08:14:45.870 --> 08:14:52.855
Did we have anybody that wanted to make a public comment before we adjourn to the reception to spend our time with Lupita?

08:14:53.415 --> 08:14:57.417
So let me just say then that we will not have a closed session tomorrow morning.

08:14:57.918 --> 08:15:02.321
And so we will adjourn today and then we will reconvene tomorrow morning at 8.30.

08:15:03.141 --> 08:15:06.263
And congratulations, Lupita, Tony, it's a great first day.

08:15:06.643 --> 08:15:08.384
We look forward to continue to work with you.

08:15:08.404 --> 08:15:09.365
We have lots of work ahead.

08:15:09.685 --> 08:15:10.486
So we'll see you tomorrow.

08:15:10.866 --> 08:15:11.106
Thank you.
