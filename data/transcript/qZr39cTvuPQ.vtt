00:00.000 --> 00:08.360
Good morning, everyone.

00:08.360 --> 00:09.360
This is President Todd Ferrante.

00:09.360 --> 00:12.760
At this time, I would like to call the Board of Education meeting to order.

00:12.760 --> 00:16.520
I would like to ask our board members to identify themselves for the record as I call your name.

00:16.520 --> 00:17.520
Todd Ferrante, present.

00:17.520 --> 00:18.520

00:18.520 --> 00:19.520
Present.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.520
Katie Yannis.

00:20.520 --> 00:21.520

William Gordy.

00:24.520 --> 00:25.520
Present.

00:25.520 --> 00:26.520
Elaine McComas.

00:26.520 --> 00:27.520
Present.

00:27.520 --> 00:28.520
And Donald Smack.

00:28.520 --> 00:29.520
Present.

00:30.160 --> 00:37.040
And now I'd like to have a motion to approve today's board meeting agenda and a second.

00:37.040 --> 00:38.040
Motion by Ms. McComas.

00:38.040 --> 00:39.040
Second.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.040
Second by Mr. Smack.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.040
All in favor?

00:41.040 --> 00:42.040
Aye.

00:42.040 --> 00:43.040
Any opposed?

00:43.040 --> 00:44.040
Okay.

00:44.040 --> 00:49.960
Now, I'd like to have a motion to enter into closed session for the following reasons.

00:49.960 --> 00:55.120
To approve closed session minutes from the previous month, section 3-305B to discuss

00:55.120 --> 00:59.880
appointment, employment, assignment, promotion, discipline, demotion, compensation, removal,

00:59.880 --> 01:05.880
resignation or performance evaluation of appointees, employees or officials of whom it has jurisdiction

01:05.880 --> 01:10.480
or any other personnel matter that affects one or more specific individuals.

01:10.480 --> 01:17.440
Section 3-305B-9 to conduct collective bargaining negotiations or consider matters related to

01:17.440 --> 01:18.720
negotiations.

01:18.720 --> 01:22.760
And section 3-305B-10 to discuss school safety.

01:22.760 --> 01:27.680
I have a motion to enter into closed session and a second.

01:27.680 --> 01:28.680
Motion by Mr. Buchanan.

01:28.680 --> 01:29.680
Second.

01:29.680 --> 01:30.680
Second by Mr. Gordy.

01:30.680 --> 01:31.680
All in favor?

01:31.680 --> 01:32.680
Aye.

01:32.680 --> 01:33.680
Any opposed?

01:33.680 --> 01:34.560
We are now in closed session.

01:59:52.760 --> 02:00:14.720
Good afternoon, everyone.

02:00:14.720 --> 02:00:18.280
As we reconvene this Board of Education meeting, I want to remind everyone that we still have

02:00:18.280 --> 02:00:19.280
a quorum.

02:00:19.800 --> 02:00:25.320
A closed session meeting was held today pursuant to General Provisions Article 3-305B of the

02:00:25.320 --> 02:00:29.920
Annotated Code of Maryland to approve previous closed session minutes to discuss personnel

02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:34.920
matters and discuss matters related to negotiations and discuss school safety.

02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:46.080
Okay, so before we begin, my sheet's here.

02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:47.080
I apologize.

02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:52.080
I've got to get my story straight here.

02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:56.680
So before we invite our pastor up for our invocation today, I would like to ask everyone

02:00:56.680 --> 02:01:01.200
if we can take a moment of silence to honor one of our own, Snow Hill Middle School's

02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:05.400
beloved Secretary Jennifer Ames, who passed away this last week.

02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:15.640
Let us bow our heads in remembrance.

02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:16.640
Thank you.

02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:22.360
I would like to ask Mr. Taylor to say a few things about Ms. Ames, if he would.

02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:28.920
Ms. Ames was someone that we all knew, although she spent her career and was from Snow Hill.

02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:32.180
She was a fixture throughout this county.

02:01:32.180 --> 02:01:39.640
She spent 37 years as a secretary or administrative assistant in Snow Hill Middle School, and

02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:46.280
it's someone that we all throughout the county have felt the loss, and unfortunately she

02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:49.200
passed away last week unexpectedly.

02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:53.000
So I ask her services this coming Saturday.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:02:00.400
I ask that all of you please keep her and her family in your thoughts and prayers, and

02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:05.480
certainly when you walk in Snow Hill Middle School, if you're a fixture in the Snow Hill

02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:11.640
area, you know what I'm talking about, but even those who do not walk into that school

02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:18.880
on a regular basis, you were always greeted by Jennifer Ames, and certainly just as a

02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:24.680
side to not make it the light side of it, every time I walked in the building, she was

02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:30.440
the first desk in and she would say things like, come in here, I need to tell you something.

02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:35.960
And I knew most of the time I better go in there and find out what she had to say, and

02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:40.040
she would ask questions all the time, but just a wonderful lady, and the kids and the

02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:47.880
community knew her, and so it's just so sad that we lose somebody unexpectedly like that.

02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:52.200
So again, our hearts go out to her and her family, and please keep her in your thoughts

02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:56.480
and prayers as we move forward this coming school year and the year ahead of us.

02:02:56.480 --> 02:02:57.640
Thank you.

02:02:57.640 --> 02:02:58.640
Thank you, Superintendent Taylor.

02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:03.000
I would like to invite Pastor Mike Montgomery from Coastal Community Church in Berlin, who

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:06.480
will lead us in the invocation today, and please remain standing for the Pledge of Allegiance.

02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:11.840
Let's pray.

02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:16.920
Jeremy, Father God, we just thank you so much for being such a great God, and Lord, I pray

02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:23.320
that as we all meet this morning, Lord, I pray that you be with all of us this evening.

02:03:23.320 --> 02:03:28.280
Lord, be with us this afternoon as we talk and we discuss and we plan for the school

02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:29.280
year ahead.

02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:34.360
Lord, be with the students that are coming in, prepare their minds to learn, be with

02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:39.480
the teachers as they go to teach, give them the words to say, give them the patience to

02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:43.800
be with these children and to teach them what they need to learn, be with the administrators

02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:48.320
as they plan and coordinate, be with this board as they continue to plan and coordinate

02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:51.840
what the school year is going to look like, and be with all of the people that are here

02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:55.760
today, Lord, who have their questions, their concerns, their ideas.

02:03:55.760 --> 02:03:59.600
Lord, I pray that everything be heard and that everything is pleasing and honoring to

02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:00.600
you.

02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:04.480
And finally, Father, we just lift up the Ames family and pray you continue to just bless

02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:05.920
them and be with them in this time.

02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:09.320
Lord, we thank you for being a great God and we give you all the praise.

02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:10.320
Amen.

02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:11.320
Amen.

02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:19.320
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for

02:04:19.320 --> 02:04:28.320
which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:33.320
I would like to share before, as Mike is sitting down, Mike is a brand new pastor to our community

02:04:33.360 --> 02:04:39.160
in the Berlin area and little do we know, but his wife was a teacher in the Pennsylvania

02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:45.920
area and Mr. Cowder interviewed her and snatched her up and his wife, they came in, he came

02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:46.920
in as a pastor.

02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:50.960
We'll be joining our family here in Worcester County and we'll be at Shaw Elementary School.

02:04:50.960 --> 02:04:57.480
So welcome, Mike, and thank you.

02:04:57.480 --> 02:05:00.240
Thank you, Pastor Montgomery.

02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:05.040
And I have a motion to approve the open session board minutes from July 11th, 2023.

02:05:05.040 --> 02:05:07.040
A motion and a second.

02:05:07.040 --> 02:05:08.040
So moved.

02:05:08.040 --> 02:05:09.040
Motion by Ms. McComas.

02:05:09.040 --> 02:05:10.040
Second.

02:05:10.040 --> 02:05:11.040
Second by Mr. Smack.

02:05:11.040 --> 02:05:12.040
All in favor?

02:05:12.040 --> 02:05:13.040
Aye.

02:05:13.040 --> 02:05:14.040
Thank you very much.

02:05:14.040 --> 02:05:17.040
Mr. President, as a notation, since I wasn't here, I need to abstain.

02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:22.640
Okay, let's make the record, show the record that Dr. Andes is abstaining from that vote.

02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:23.640
Thank you.

02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:28.640
And now I'll turn it over to the superintendent for the superintendent's report.

02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:32.040
Thank you, Mr. Fronte, and again, welcome everyone.

02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:36.040
And I can't believe it's, summer is closing fast.

02:05:36.040 --> 02:05:39.640
I see a lot of teachers out there shaking their head, and I agree with you.

02:05:39.640 --> 02:05:47.000
But my report today is really centered around our preparations to the kickoff of the 2023-24

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.280
school year.

02:05:49.280 --> 02:05:54.040
If you can believe it, the next time this board education meets, we will have been in

02:05:54.040 --> 02:05:56.640
school for two weeks.

02:05:57.640 --> 02:06:00.640
Yeah, exactly.

02:06:00.640 --> 02:06:02.640
But let's not jump ahead too quickly.

02:06:02.640 --> 02:06:09.240
Our 2023 summer academics were once again widely successful, with students engaged in

02:06:09.240 --> 02:06:14.640
a wide array of activities geared towards closing learning gaps as well as enriching

02:06:14.640 --> 02:06:17.640
students with STEM and arts programs.

02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:24.320
I want to give a special shout out to our STAT camp, STAT camp, which has been an incredible

02:06:24.320 --> 02:06:31.400
opportunity for our middle and high school students to have truly hands-on, and I mean

02:06:31.400 --> 02:06:36.200
truly hands-on if you're able to see it, learning experiences.

02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:41.800
I want to thank our county for being a great partner in funding this worthwhile program

02:06:41.800 --> 02:06:43.960
for our older students.

02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:49.520
This week, just yesterday, we welcomed new educators and staff into our Worcester County

02:06:49.520 --> 02:06:56.200
Public Schools family as we hold or as we're holding our annual orientation for this year's

02:06:56.200 --> 02:06:58.280
hiring class.

02:06:58.280 --> 02:07:03.440
Just yesterday morning, as I said, our current reigning teacher of the year, Dr. Jamie Regely,

02:07:03.440 --> 02:07:09.480
and I were very excited to speak to our new teachers to welcome them and inspire them

02:07:09.480 --> 02:07:13.720
as they join our Worcester County Public Schools family.

02:07:13.720 --> 02:07:19.120
And in just a short time, less than two weeks now, all of our faculty and staff will be

02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:25.240
returning to get our classrooms and schools ready for the return of our students in early

02:07:25.240 --> 02:07:26.240
September.

02:07:26.240 --> 02:07:29.840
And as you know, we start with our students the day after Labor Day.

02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:34.680
I hope I can speak on behalf of the board up here that we are looking forward to getting

02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:40.320
out to our schools for our first day tour to greet our students, their families, and

02:07:40.320 --> 02:07:42.200
our staff.

02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:47.400
We have done this for the last eight years and just had a lot of positive things happen

02:07:47.400 --> 02:07:48.760
during that day.

02:07:49.400 --> 02:07:55.840
It's a stressful day and it's a long day because we hit all 14 schools in one day.

02:07:55.840 --> 02:08:01.320
Be sure to follow us on our social media as we cross the county and as always, we encourage

02:08:01.320 --> 02:08:08.880
all our families to share your first day of school photos with us using the hashtag welcome

02:08:08.880 --> 02:08:11.000
back Worcester.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:14.080
And so again, it's an exciting time.

02:08:14.080 --> 02:08:17.400
We're looking forward to get our students back in.

02:08:17.560 --> 02:08:20.240
And I know we're going to have a great school year in front of us.

02:08:20.240 --> 02:08:22.600
So with that, I'll turn it back over to you, Ms. Fronte.

02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:24.080
Thank you, Mr. Taylor.

02:08:24.080 --> 02:08:29.800
I'd now like to welcome our 2023-2024 student representatives who are joining us today to

02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:32.320
provide their monthly updates from their schools.

02:08:32.320 --> 02:08:37.320
And I believe this month we're starting with Tristan from Pocomoke High School.

02:08:37.320 --> 02:08:43.120
Thank you, Mr. Fronte.

02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:48.320
In late July, the successful culmination of the Summer Academy marked a significant achievement,

02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:53.000
offering students a comprehensive range of opportunities, encompassing service learning

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:59.600
projects, driver's education, and litera tutoring in ELA and mathematics.

02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:04.640
A notable highlight emerged with the future educators in the Made Men program, who received

02:09:04.640 --> 02:09:10.520
three college credits through a collaborative effort with UMES's High School Teacher Academy.

02:09:10.920 --> 02:09:16.120
Meanwhile, the commencement of fall sports encompassing soccer, field hockey, cross-country,

02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:22.520
volleyball, golf, and unified cornhole has been promising, aided by free physicals provided

02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:25.480
by the school-based health center.

02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:32.000
Additionally, Pocomoke JROTC orchestrated a first-year cadet orientation camp, engaging

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:36.480
participants in activities such as drill, physical fitness, marksmanship, and had a

02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:40.320
Q&A session with the leadership panel of senior cadets.

02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:44.480
The summer allowed current cadets to participate in national drill camp and senior leadership

02:09:44.480 --> 02:09:49.960
camps, encapsulating the spirit of growth and commitment within the academy.

02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:55.640
Lastly, Pocomoke High School's group speak up was featured on the front of an MSCA magazine

02:09:55.640 --> 02:09:58.720
a part of their action line section.

02:09:58.720 --> 02:10:01.920
We thank speak up for their work.

02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:03.880
We've got some exciting events coming up.

02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:08.500
Today, our AP teachers are hitting the road with yard signs and yummy treats to celebrate

02:10:08.540 --> 02:10:13.100
students who rock their AP assessments with a three, four, or five.

02:10:13.100 --> 02:10:15.420
Pocomoke seniors are marking their calendars.

02:10:15.420 --> 02:10:19.620
Senior Warrior Day is happening on August 22nd, a chance for the class of 2024 and their

02:10:19.620 --> 02:10:23.460
families to gear up for a big year together.

02:10:23.460 --> 02:10:29.060
We're also taking our new Pocomoke area teachers on a tour around Pocomoke City with our PHS

02:10:29.060 --> 02:10:33.340
drumline, adding some rhythm to the mix and showing off our fresh faces.

02:10:33.340 --> 02:10:36.580
The Pocomoke Back to School Block Party is on August 30th.

02:10:36.580 --> 02:10:41.420
This event is shared with all Pocomoke Community Schools, bringing together partners, students,

02:10:41.420 --> 02:10:46.740
families, and staff at Cypress Park to kick off the new school year with a bang.

02:10:46.740 --> 02:10:51.020
And last but not least, we're rolling out the red carpet for our incoming Warriors on

02:10:51.020 --> 02:10:53.700
Freshman Warrior Day on August 31st.

02:10:53.700 --> 02:10:56.020
New beginnings are near.

02:10:56.020 --> 02:10:59.540
We as Pocomoke Community Schools would like to thank the Board of Education and Executive

02:10:59.540 --> 02:11:02.780
Team for their continued support of students.

02:11:02.780 --> 02:11:03.780
Thank you.

02:11:03.780 --> 02:11:05.180
Now on to Delia Holland.

02:11:06.580 --> 02:11:08.820
Thank you, Tristan.

02:11:08.820 --> 02:11:14.980
Neither the heat nor the summer have slowed things down at Steve Nicator High School.

02:11:14.980 --> 02:11:19.740
Looking back on July, we had a very successful summer academy that included the enrichment

02:11:19.740 --> 02:11:25.220
and academic programs of sign language and deaf culture, Spanish culture, world art and

02:11:25.220 --> 02:11:29.380
photography, High School 101, and SAT prep.

02:11:29.380 --> 02:11:34.340
We were just shy of 100 participants, not including dozens of volunteers.

02:11:34.340 --> 02:11:38.700
And we had a 100% success rate for our credit recovery students.

02:11:38.700 --> 02:11:42.060
Our summer theater camp was also extremely successful.

02:11:42.060 --> 02:11:46.140
It was great welcoming our future Seahawks into our hallways and building their confidence

02:11:46.140 --> 02:11:48.180
on and off stage.

02:11:48.180 --> 02:11:53.020
Meanwhile, our school counselors have been busy finalizing schedules, teachers have been

02:11:53.020 --> 02:11:58.900
in and out of the building for professional development, PBIS, PLC, and student improvement

02:11:58.900 --> 02:12:04.260
planning, and we've had all hands on deck preparing our building for the start of school.

02:12:04.300 --> 02:12:10.060
That includes our new state of the art weight room and a newly air conditioned gymnasium.

02:12:10.060 --> 02:12:14.500
Looking forward, we have nearly 400 athletes working hard each day preparing for the fall

02:12:14.500 --> 02:12:20.660
sports season, and we have our talented musicians coming in for preseason band camp.

02:12:20.660 --> 02:12:25.940
We are excited to welcome our new staff members to the building, SAT test takers on August

02:12:25.940 --> 02:12:32.820
26, and over 350 freshmen along with their parents, family members, National Honor Society,

02:12:32.820 --> 02:12:40.340
and NJROTC volunteers during our annual Freshman Seahawk Day prior to the official start of school.

02:12:40.340 --> 02:12:44.500
On a final note, we want to give a special shout out to our custodians who have all worked

02:12:44.500 --> 02:12:49.140
tremendously hard all summer cleaning and preparing our school for September 5th.

02:12:49.140 --> 02:12:56.340
We can't wait to see our students back in the classrooms and walking our hallways.

02:12:56.340 --> 02:13:00.860
Now I will be reading the Worcester Technical High School board notes.

02:13:00.900 --> 02:13:04.980
Summer seems to have flown by, hard to believe that new teachers are in training already

02:13:04.980 --> 02:13:08.540
and that veteran teachers will be back in two weeks.

02:13:08.540 --> 02:13:12.820
We'd like to once again thank our custodial staff for getting our building looking beautiful

02:13:12.820 --> 02:13:18.260
and ready for the arrival of 554 students for the fall semester.

02:13:18.260 --> 02:13:20.900
Our summer stat camp was a huge success.

02:13:20.900 --> 02:13:26.860
In the three years of holding it, our numbers have climbed from 60 to over 100 students participating.

02:13:26.860 --> 02:13:32.420
We are excited to welcome the staff of the NEST Early Learning Center to our building.

02:13:32.420 --> 02:13:36.500
The program will service two and three-year-olds and will allow some of our early childhood

02:13:36.500 --> 02:13:39.780
class students to do an apprenticeship.

02:13:39.780 --> 02:13:42.460
It is very exciting to get this up and running.

02:13:42.460 --> 02:13:46.200
Once again, we'd like to thank the Board of Education System for all the support that

02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:48.620
they give our school and school system.

02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:52.420
Worcester County is clearly one of the best systems in the state.

02:13:52.420 --> 02:13:59.700
Now I'll be passing it on to Catalina from Snowhill High School.

02:13:59.700 --> 02:14:01.220
Thank you, Delia.

02:14:01.220 --> 02:14:06.940
As Snowhill High School gears up for the upcoming school year, we warmly welcome our newly hired

02:14:06.940 --> 02:14:09.700
teachers and educational assistants.

02:14:09.700 --> 02:14:13.980
With our new and dynamic leadership team, we are confident that this year will be nothing

02:14:13.980 --> 02:14:16.100
short of exhilarating.

02:14:16.100 --> 02:14:21.300
Fall athletes kicked off on August 9th with an impressive turnout of students participating

02:14:21.300 --> 02:14:24.700
in various sports.

02:14:24.700 --> 02:14:29.700
The band camp is currently underway and we are thrilled to see such a high level of student

02:14:29.700 --> 02:14:31.020
involvement.

02:14:31.020 --> 02:14:36.740
The ROTC program was very active over the summer with our senior cadets attending leadership,

02:14:36.740 --> 02:14:39.700
aviation and national drill camps.

02:14:39.700 --> 02:14:45.220
We proudly welcome 20 new cadets during the orientation week of our first year cadets.

02:14:45.220 --> 02:14:50.940
Recently our ROTC program also made an appearance on the Blessing of the Combines event.

02:14:50.940 --> 02:14:56.020
Our students marched in the parade and contributed to the community by running games and booths.

02:14:56.020 --> 02:15:02.620
Additionally, as part of our Summerco Academy, SHHS hosted an outdoor academy that was run

02:15:02.620 --> 02:15:10.260
by two of our teachers, Ms. Ashley Striebig, a biology and environmental science teacher,

02:15:10.260 --> 02:15:14.540
and Mr. Jake Nathan, our communication arts and English teacher.

02:15:14.540 --> 02:15:19.100
We had 14 freshman and sophomore students participate in the program.

02:15:19.100 --> 02:15:25.500
With each week focusing on a different topic of the environment and traveling to different

02:15:25.500 --> 02:15:30.340
locations on the eastern shore, after learning about all the different ecosystems traveled

02:15:30.340 --> 02:15:35.180
to, students then completed portfolios about their experiences and shared them with their

02:15:35.180 --> 02:15:36.180
peers.

02:15:36.180 --> 02:15:42.100
Moreover, the counseling office is gearing up for an upcoming school year by meeting

02:15:42.100 --> 02:15:44.540
with parents and students to finalize schedules.

02:15:44.540 --> 02:15:50.820
Our seniors and their families are taking advantage of summer meetings wherein which

02:15:50.820 --> 02:15:56.300
they can get a jump start on their senior year by accessing their schedules, learning

02:15:56.300 --> 02:16:02.700
about college application and financial aid process, getting more information about military

02:16:02.700 --> 02:16:06.140
and work ready opportunities after high school and more.

02:16:06.140 --> 02:16:10.940
On August 31st we will host our annual freshman orientation.

02:16:11.940 --> 02:16:14.740
Asing 9th graders and their families will have the opportunity to meet the staff, obtain

02:16:14.740 --> 02:16:20.460
their schedule, tour the building and get an overview of Snow Hill High School.

02:16:20.460 --> 02:16:24.060
Freshman focused mentors will be on site to assist their mentees.

02:16:24.060 --> 02:16:30.780
We are excited to welcome our incoming freshmen along with all students new to our school.

02:16:30.780 --> 02:16:34.180
Overall we are excited and confident that the upcoming school year will be one of the

02:16:34.180 --> 02:16:35.820
best.

02:16:35.820 --> 02:16:36.820
Thank you.

02:16:36.820 --> 02:16:37.820
And now back to Mr. Ferranche.

02:16:38.700 --> 02:16:43.180
Catalina, Delia and Tristan, thank you all for being here on your summer vacation.

02:16:43.180 --> 02:16:47.980
We know that school is right around the corner but we appreciate those very informative reports.

02:16:47.980 --> 02:16:49.900
Thank you so much.

02:16:49.900 --> 02:16:55.260
Now it's time to recognize some audience members who are joining us from the following organizations

02:16:55.260 --> 02:16:56.260
today.

02:16:56.260 --> 02:17:02.380
Do we have anyone here, and I already see her, from the WCTA?

02:17:02.380 --> 02:17:03.380
Good afternoon, Beth.

02:17:03.380 --> 02:17:06.380
How are you today?

02:17:06.380 --> 02:17:07.380
WCESPA?

02:17:07.940 --> 02:17:16.500
Worcester County Retired School Personnel?

02:17:16.500 --> 02:17:17.500
Thank you, Helen.

02:17:17.500 --> 02:17:18.500
Thanks for being here.

02:17:18.500 --> 02:17:23.780
Representatives from various schools, SIACs, PTAs, anyone?

02:17:23.780 --> 02:17:25.220
Okay.

02:17:25.220 --> 02:17:29.740
Now we have one recognition today, I'm going to turn that over to Mr. Tolbert's Community

02:17:29.740 --> 02:17:30.740
Recognition.

02:17:30.740 --> 02:17:31.740
Thank you, Mr. Tolbert.

02:17:31.740 --> 02:17:32.740
Thank you, Mr. Ferranche.

02:17:32.740 --> 02:17:35.420
Good afternoon, everybody.

02:17:35.460 --> 02:17:38.820
As you know, each year we have a fundraising campaign for the local United Way here at

02:17:38.820 --> 02:17:40.820
Worcester County Public Schools.

02:17:40.820 --> 02:17:43.780
And as all things in Worcester County Public Schools, whether it's academics, whether it's

02:17:43.780 --> 02:17:46.980
sports or whether it's fundraising, we always want to be number one.

02:17:46.980 --> 02:17:51.860
So we worked hard, I'm proud to say we had a record-breaking year, a number of $67,000

02:17:51.860 --> 02:17:53.420
raised for our local United Way.

02:17:53.420 --> 02:17:56.020
Today we have Ms. Amanda Haley here with United Way.

02:17:56.020 --> 02:17:57.020
You want to come up, Amanda?

02:17:57.020 --> 02:18:00.620
And we're going to recognize each school and the amount that they raised.

02:18:00.620 --> 02:18:04.620
Did you want to say anything first, Amanda?

02:18:05.620 --> 02:18:06.620
Hello.

02:18:06.620 --> 02:18:07.620
Good afternoon, everybody.

02:18:07.620 --> 02:18:08.620
Thank you for having me here.

02:18:08.620 --> 02:18:09.620
Thank you for having me here, Ford.

02:18:09.620 --> 02:18:12.620
I appreciate it very much.

02:18:12.620 --> 02:18:16.620
Pam and I talked last week, and I just want to say thank you for everything that you guys

02:18:16.620 --> 02:18:19.620
do, not just for the United Way campaign, but in your community.

02:18:19.620 --> 02:18:23.620
As a parent, thank you for all of the incentives and the enrichments that you provide to your

02:18:23.620 --> 02:18:27.620
kids, not just coming into the classroom to teach, but all of the extra things that you

02:18:27.620 --> 02:18:31.620
do in the weekends, in the evenings, and how you give back to your community.

02:18:31.620 --> 02:18:35.620
So very much appreciative of all that you do as teachers and individuals, but also in

02:18:35.620 --> 02:18:39.620
your support of the United Way campaign, and I wish you all a great and successful year.

02:18:40.620 --> 02:18:41.620
Thank you.

02:18:41.620 --> 02:18:42.620
Thanks, Amanda.

02:18:42.620 --> 02:18:46.620
So I'm going to call each school up, and then you're going to do a group picture at the end,

02:18:46.620 --> 02:18:47.620
Carrie?

02:18:47.620 --> 02:18:48.620
Okay, thank you very much.

02:18:48.620 --> 02:18:53.620
First we have Cedar Chapel Special School that raised $1,599.

02:19:02.620 --> 02:19:07.620
Next up we have Snow Hill Middle School with $2,459.

02:19:20.620 --> 02:19:25.620
Next up we have Steve McCarron Middle School of $2,660.

02:19:31.620 --> 02:19:40.620
Next up is Chatham Elementary School with $3,099.

02:19:40.620 --> 02:20:02.620

02:20:11.620 --> 02:20:16.620
Next up is Buckingham Elementary School with $3,532.

Thank you everyone very much for all your help and all your participation.

02:22:32.620 --> 02:22:34.620
Ready for a group picture?

02:22:40.620 --> 02:22:42.620
Thank you.

02:23:10.620 --> 02:23:12.620
Thank you all very much.

02:23:32.620 --> 02:23:34.620
Thank you, Mr. Stolbert.

02:23:34.620 --> 02:23:35.620
You're welcome, sir.

02:23:35.620 --> 02:23:40.620
Now it's time for individuals and delegation comments.

02:23:40.620 --> 02:23:44.620
All individuals who sign up to address the Worcester County Board of Education

02:23:44.620 --> 02:23:48.620
may do so for one or two minutes regarding information, accommodations, or concerns,

02:23:48.620 --> 02:23:50.620
which may need future board attention.

02:23:50.620 --> 02:23:54.620
Concerns that are specific to an individual will not be discussed in the open session

02:23:54.620 --> 02:23:58.620
and should be directed to appropriate district personnel for investigation.

02:23:58.620 --> 02:24:02.620
When you are called to address the board, please state your name and address for the record.

02:24:02.620 --> 02:24:06.620
And first up we have Myra Biggins.

02:24:06.620 --> 02:24:08.620
Myra?

02:24:17.620 --> 02:24:19.620
Good afternoon.

02:24:22.620 --> 02:24:26.620
My name is Myra Biggins. I live at 500 Maple Street, Apartment 15.

02:24:26.620 --> 02:24:28.620
Pull your mic closer to you. There you go.

02:24:28.620 --> 02:24:30.620
Just so we can hear you. Thank you.

02:24:30.620 --> 02:24:36.620
My name is Myra Biggins. I live at 500 Maple Street, Apartment 15, Snow Hill, Maryland.

02:24:36.620 --> 02:24:39.620
Good afternoon. My name is Myra again.

02:24:39.620 --> 02:24:42.620
I live in Snow Hill again.

02:24:42.620 --> 02:24:47.620
As a parent with children who have attended Snow Hill Elementary School,

02:24:47.620 --> 02:24:52.620
Demo Biggins and a current student who attends Demani College,

02:24:52.620 --> 02:24:55.620
I am proud of the education my children are receiving.

02:24:55.620 --> 02:24:59.620
I'm excited to work with the new administration and staff at Snow Hill Elementary School.

02:24:59.620 --> 02:25:02.620
Congratulations Mrs. Matlock.

02:25:02.620 --> 02:25:05.620
I am confident my daughter will have a successful year.

02:25:05.620 --> 02:25:10.620
Last year Snow Hill Elementary School was recognized at the Maryland State Department of Education

02:25:10.620 --> 02:25:13.620
because of the academic achievement of the kindergarten students.

02:25:13.620 --> 02:25:19.620
I applaud the Worcester County Public School District leadership team for accepting the pre-K expansion grant

02:25:19.620 --> 02:25:23.620
for another pre-K 3 classroom at the Snow Hill Elementary School this year

02:25:23.620 --> 02:25:27.620
because the youngest kids in Snow Hill need to be in school.

02:25:27.620 --> 02:25:32.620
I want the county to fund the additional pre-K 3 classroom when this grant runs out.

02:25:32.620 --> 02:25:39.620
I am most concerned with the district's plan to recruit and retain diverse teaching staff.

02:25:39.620 --> 02:25:45.620
It is possible the student can go through Worcester County Public Schools and never have a teacher of color.

02:25:45.620 --> 02:25:49.620
It is important for my daughter to see a teacher that looks like her,

02:25:49.620 --> 02:25:56.620
who represents her culture, and gives her insight for her professional career in the future.

02:25:56.620 --> 02:25:58.620
Thank you.

02:26:03.620 --> 02:26:05.620
Next up we have Amanda Bunting.

02:26:11.620 --> 02:26:13.620
Hello.

02:26:13.620 --> 02:26:15.620
I'm Amanda Bunting.

02:26:15.620 --> 02:26:18.620
I live on Exeter Road in West Ocean City, Maryland.

02:26:18.620 --> 02:26:23.620
I'm also a firefighter paramedic for the town of Ocean City for the last 20 years.

02:26:23.620 --> 02:26:25.620
I have two boys.

02:26:25.620 --> 02:26:29.620
My youngest, Buxton, is just starting Ocean City Elementary School this year as a kindergartner,

02:26:29.620 --> 02:26:31.620
and my oldest is entering second grade.

02:26:31.620 --> 02:26:35.620
He also started when he was in kindergarten.

02:26:35.620 --> 02:26:38.620
Today I want to talk about my experience so far.

02:26:38.620 --> 02:26:42.620
My oldest has an IEP for reading and writing at Ocean City.

02:26:42.620 --> 02:26:47.620
I was very worried when he wasn't learning how to read despite all the hours that we were putting in together.

02:26:47.620 --> 02:26:50.620
That's when we decided to have him evaluated for the second time,

02:26:50.620 --> 02:26:54.620
since he didn't qualify when he was four or two years prior.

02:26:54.620 --> 02:26:57.620
It was because of his experienced teacher that she knew something was off,

02:26:57.620 --> 02:27:00.620
that we knew we had to have him evaluated again,

02:27:00.620 --> 02:27:02.620
and that he would benefit from the extra help.

02:27:02.620 --> 02:27:04.620
The team that we met with was six to eight people,

02:27:04.620 --> 02:27:06.620
which is a lot of people for just one student.

02:27:06.620 --> 02:27:11.620
I didn't realize that much work went in to every IEP for every student.

02:27:11.620 --> 02:27:13.620
This has completely changed school for us.

02:27:13.620 --> 02:27:18.620
He's gone from being the child that came home every night exhausted and crying when we tried to read his books

02:27:18.620 --> 02:27:21.620
to the person that has so much confidence.

02:27:21.620 --> 02:27:23.620
He's been a STAR student twice this spring,

02:27:23.620 --> 02:27:26.620
and he's actually also been a student of the month.

02:27:26.620 --> 02:27:30.620
So that is just a complete change for him.

02:27:30.620 --> 02:27:33.620
He's excited to perform in the school play now this year.

02:27:33.620 --> 02:27:35.620
He's made lasting friendships.

02:27:35.620 --> 02:27:38.620
So this has been a complete 180 and a big turnaround.

02:27:38.620 --> 02:27:41.620
I credit his IEP team, especially Ms. Levin and Ms. Colgrove,

02:27:41.620 --> 02:27:44.620
for their experience, their dedication to his learning,

02:27:44.620 --> 02:27:47.620
and the nurturing environment that they provided for him.

02:27:47.620 --> 02:27:50.620
He also has been fortunate to go to summer school for the past two summers,

02:27:50.620 --> 02:27:55.620
and that consistency with school throughout the summer has been amazing for him

02:27:55.620 --> 02:28:00.620
because he isn't able to read at home and to focus, and there's so many distractions.

02:28:00.620 --> 02:28:05.620
So that learning environment that those teachers provide for him in school,

02:28:05.620 --> 02:28:12.620
he just wouldn't be a success without it.

02:28:12.620 --> 02:28:17.620
He works so hard, and now that he actually sees measurable results,

02:28:17.620 --> 02:28:20.620
like these milestones that he set for himself that he can achieve,

02:28:20.620 --> 02:28:24.620
his confidence is built so much, and I didn't expect it so quickly.

02:28:24.620 --> 02:28:27.620
Like, when they set that plan into effect,

02:28:27.620 --> 02:28:30.620
how soon that he would actually meet these goals and achieve it,

02:28:30.620 --> 02:28:32.620
and just the turnaround is personality.

02:28:32.620 --> 02:28:35.620
So that is his story, so thank you for listening to me.

02:28:35.620 --> 02:28:38.620
I knew I was going to run over because I can't keep anything in two minutes.

02:28:38.620 --> 02:28:42.620
So thank you so much, and I just want to share that positive experience with Ocean City.

02:28:42.620 --> 02:28:48.620
Thank you for sharing that. Thank you.

02:28:48.620 --> 02:29:02.620
Next up is Willie Brown.

02:29:02.620 --> 02:29:03.620
Good afternoon.

02:29:03.620 --> 02:29:06.620
Good afternoon. Good afternoon, board members.

02:29:06.620 --> 02:29:09.620
My name is Dr. Willie Brown, Jr.,

02:29:09.620 --> 02:29:16.620
and I reside at 333 Winter Quarters Drive, Pocomoke City, Maryland.

02:29:16.620 --> 02:29:23.620
As you know, Worcester County Public Schools has been doing an amazing job as a system,

02:29:23.620 --> 02:29:29.620
as well as keeping a student center focused for not only our students,

02:29:29.620 --> 02:29:32.620
the parents, but the community.

02:29:32.620 --> 02:29:37.620
The work that has been done by the teachers, by the leaders,

02:29:37.620 --> 02:29:43.620
and by all staff members throughout the whole town district should be commended,

02:29:43.620 --> 02:29:47.620
and the work has definitely been completed with passion.

02:29:47.620 --> 02:29:52.620
My child, Willie Brown III and Lydia Brown,

02:29:52.620 --> 02:29:56.620
both attend Pocomoke Elementary School.

02:29:56.620 --> 02:29:58.620
They are entering the third grade.

02:29:59.620 --> 02:30:02.620
Willie, Lydia is entering in the second grade.

02:30:02.620 --> 02:30:10.620
I cannot begin to tell you all how much support that we have seen from the school system,

02:30:10.620 --> 02:30:15.620
from the community, and the outcomes has been goal-centric.

02:30:15.620 --> 02:30:20.620
Not only have every student in the county, for what we see,

02:30:20.620 --> 02:30:27.620
feel like the skills and the knowledge that was gained throughout the school year has been successful,

02:30:27.620 --> 02:30:32.620
but we also want to keep the system performing at a high level,

02:30:32.620 --> 02:30:40.620
as we recruit more staff, teachers, administrators, retain the best teachers,

02:30:40.620 --> 02:30:46.620
and as we look at the highest priority for funding resources.

02:30:46.620 --> 02:30:53.620
I am hopeful that as more demands come about the Maryland Blueprint,

02:30:53.620 --> 02:31:01.620
that we maintain the small class sizes and the quality of education that make the system so special.

02:31:01.620 --> 02:31:09.620
I want to conclude by saying sincerely thank you for your efforts at Washington County Public School.

02:31:09.620 --> 02:31:10.620
Thank you.

02:31:10.620 --> 02:31:11.620
Thank you.

02:31:11.620 --> 02:31:12.620
Thank you.

02:31:17.620 --> 02:31:19.620
Next up, Laura Charle.

02:31:23.620 --> 02:31:32.620
Good afternoon.

02:31:32.620 --> 02:31:33.620
My name is Laura Charle.

02:31:33.620 --> 02:31:39.620
I live on Juneway Lane in Ocean Pines, and I have a first grader at Shell Elementary,

02:31:39.620 --> 02:31:41.620
and he has special needs.

02:31:41.620 --> 02:31:42.620
He has an IEP.

02:31:42.620 --> 02:31:47.620
He has autism in addition to other special needs.

02:31:47.620 --> 02:31:50.620
We've taken him to many medical professionals.

02:31:50.620 --> 02:31:52.620
He's a conundrum to them.

02:31:52.620 --> 02:31:55.620
We've gone down lots of different avenues trying to figure it out,

02:31:55.620 --> 02:32:01.620
and medical professionals, they kind of said we're going to stop trying to figure him out.

02:32:01.620 --> 02:32:09.620
But the people who have not stopped trying figuring out my son are the teachers at Shell Elementary.

02:32:09.620 --> 02:32:16.620
And his IEP team, they never stop trying,

02:32:16.620 --> 02:32:21.620
and they have had him meet so many milestones and so many breakthroughs,

02:32:21.620 --> 02:32:25.620
and they're just, they're like my family now.

02:32:25.620 --> 02:32:33.620
And the thing that I wanted to point out today is that when I heard that Summer Academy was going to be cut from Shell,

02:32:33.620 --> 02:32:36.620
I cried, like ugly cried.

02:32:36.620 --> 02:32:43.620
He thrives in the smaller classes there, and he thrives year-round with the team that he has,

02:32:43.620 --> 02:32:46.620
but Summer Academy is really special for him.

02:32:46.620 --> 02:32:50.620
And routine is very, very important to him.

02:32:50.620 --> 02:32:52.620
Oh, my goodness.

02:32:52.620 --> 02:32:58.620
And if he qualifies for ESY next year, which he probably will,

02:32:58.620 --> 02:33:00.620
it won't be the same if it's not at Shell.

02:33:00.620 --> 02:33:02.620
He'll be at a different school.

02:33:02.620 --> 02:33:07.620
He'll be longer bus ride, different teachers likely,

02:33:07.620 --> 02:33:10.620
and it's going to disrupt his learning and his progress,

02:33:10.620 --> 02:33:12.620
and we need that time in the summer.

02:33:12.620 --> 02:33:16.620
And I know I'm not the only family that's going to say this,

02:33:16.620 --> 02:33:20.620
so let me speak for all those families that want Summer Academy at Shell to continue,

02:33:20.620 --> 02:33:22.620
and the other schools that it's going to be cut from.

02:33:22.620 --> 02:33:23.620
It's so important.

02:33:23.620 --> 02:33:24.620
Thank you.

02:33:24.620 --> 02:33:25.620
Thank you so much.

02:33:25.620 --> 02:33:29.620
Thank you.

02:33:29.620 --> 02:33:38.620
Next up is Megan Seiler.

02:33:39.620 --> 02:33:40.620
My name is Megan Seiler.

02:33:40.620 --> 02:33:42.620
I live on Franklin Avenue in Berlin.

02:33:42.620 --> 02:33:45.620
I also teach at Stephen Decatur High School.

02:33:45.620 --> 02:33:50.620
When negotiations were complete and sent to association members for voting,

02:33:50.620 --> 02:33:53.620
I was asked what I think a fair place to settle would be.

02:33:53.620 --> 02:33:56.620
I don't know if I can truly give a fair colon number

02:33:56.620 --> 02:34:00.620
because I don't have enough knowledge of how negotiations went.

02:34:00.620 --> 02:34:06.620
I think the original 4% was too low, and honestly settling for that was hard.

02:34:06.620 --> 02:34:09.620
I had voted no for that ratification as well.

02:34:09.620 --> 02:34:15.620
In the long term, every year we get slighted on cola is another ding to my retirement.

02:34:15.620 --> 02:34:20.620
In the short term, it's a battle between low colas and high inflation.

02:34:20.620 --> 02:34:25.620
It's deciding between buying a full grocery load of food or filling up my gas.

02:34:25.620 --> 02:34:28.620
It's relying on community donations to make my classroom

02:34:28.620 --> 02:34:31.620
and instruction inviting for my students.

02:34:31.620 --> 02:34:37.620
It's holding my breath between paychecks as I try not to let my daughter

02:34:37.620 --> 02:34:42.620
see my stress and sadness when I tell her we don't have the money right now.

02:34:52.620 --> 02:34:57.620
The bonus, though nice, is truly just a bonus.

02:34:57.620 --> 02:35:04.620
It would not help my lifelong earnings, nor will it help negotiations in the spring.

02:35:04.620 --> 02:35:10.620
My next year's negotiations are based off my salary, not my salary plus a bonus.

02:35:10.620 --> 02:35:16.620
Even the mandate of $60,000 for first-year teachers isn't much.

02:35:20.620 --> 02:35:24.620
I always check up when I think of my daughter.

02:35:24.620 --> 02:35:27.620
Take a deep breath, you're okay.

02:35:33.620 --> 02:35:41.620
With inflation, that $60,000 in 2026 isn't the $60,000 we're talking about today.

02:35:41.620 --> 02:35:46.620
I fear we will always be the lowest paid in the state, but how did we get here?

02:35:46.620 --> 02:35:50.620
We didn't used to be like this.

02:35:50.620 --> 02:35:55.620
The financial situation of this county needs to be addressed locally and higher.

02:35:55.620 --> 02:35:58.620
I know everyone says the funding formula can't be changed.

02:35:58.620 --> 02:36:04.620
Since May, I personally have written to or spoken to Senator Mary Beth Carroza,

02:36:04.620 --> 02:36:09.620
multiple county commissioners, and members of the board present here today.

02:36:09.620 --> 02:36:13.620
It seems that no one wants to work with anyone outside their group

02:36:13.620 --> 02:36:15.620
with someone on the front line.

02:36:15.620 --> 02:36:19.620
Is that how it should be?

02:36:19.620 --> 02:36:25.620
I'm going to have to skip, but I'm just tired of the secretness of education and funding.

02:36:27.620 --> 02:36:31.620
We are not allowed information until decisions are made.

02:36:31.620 --> 02:36:36.620
I feel like a pawn with no knowledge of how we got where we are and where we're going.

02:36:38.620 --> 02:36:39.620
Thank you.

02:36:39.620 --> 02:36:40.620
Thank you.

02:36:42.620 --> 02:36:44.620
Mary Hathaway?

02:36:44.620 --> 02:36:49.620
Good afternoon.

02:36:49.620 --> 02:36:50.620
Good afternoon.

02:36:50.620 --> 02:36:52.620
My name is Mary Malone Hathaway.

02:36:52.620 --> 02:36:55.620
I live on Camelot Circle in Ocean Pines, Maryland.

02:36:55.620 --> 02:37:02.620
Like Megan, I'm a single mom, and I am a very proud teacher in Worcester County Public Schools.

02:37:02.620 --> 02:37:05.620
I've been a teacher at Stephen Decatur High School for 12 years.

02:37:05.620 --> 02:37:10.620
I'm also a product of Worcester County Public Schools from Shaw Elementary,

02:37:10.620 --> 02:37:12.620
although it looks a little bit different now,

02:37:12.620 --> 02:37:16.620
up through Stephen Decatur High School, or Superintendent Taylor, you were my principal.

02:37:16.620 --> 02:37:20.620
I have been proud to be a Worcester County student,

02:37:20.620 --> 02:37:25.620
and when I decided I wanted to become a teacher, this was the only place I wanted to make a home.

02:37:25.620 --> 02:37:28.620
But I'm not here today to talk about myself as a teacher.

02:37:28.620 --> 02:37:31.620
I'm here as a concerned parent.

02:37:31.620 --> 02:37:35.620
When I decided to form a family, this is where I wanted my daughter to go to school.

02:37:35.620 --> 02:37:40.620
I wanted my daughter to have the amazing experiences that the other people before me have spoken about.

02:37:40.620 --> 02:37:46.620
I wanted her to have the educational benefits that I received from Worcester County Public Schools.

02:37:46.620 --> 02:37:50.620
I wanted to know that when my daughter graduated, that her diploma would carry weight,

02:37:50.620 --> 02:37:56.620
and that when she went out into the world, she would have the skills that Worcester County Public Schools provided her with.

02:37:56.620 --> 02:38:02.620
However, due to recent cuts in programs and decisions that have been made in this county,

02:38:02.620 --> 02:38:06.620
I am starting to be concerned about what my daughter's education looks like.

02:38:06.620 --> 02:38:13.620
She starts kindergarten in two short weeks, and despite thriving last year at Pre-K4 at Chow Elementary School,

02:38:13.620 --> 02:38:16.620
I'm nervous what the next 12 years look like for her.

02:38:16.620 --> 02:38:22.620
Not only for myself in the bottom line, but what that means for opportunities for her moving forward,

02:38:22.620 --> 02:38:28.620
whether it's after school programs for enrichment, or God forbid she needs some remediation or stay after with a teacher,

02:38:28.620 --> 02:38:32.620
those opportunities may not be there for her.

02:38:32.620 --> 02:38:38.620
I am urging you, as we move forward, to, as Megan said, come together and work together

02:38:38.620 --> 02:38:44.620
and think about all of our students, much more than dollars and cents on a line item budget.

02:38:44.620 --> 02:38:46.620
But think about their futures.

02:38:46.620 --> 02:38:52.620
Worcester County has always been an incredible place to go to school, and I am proud to be part of that.

02:38:52.620 --> 02:38:58.620
As I see my wonderful students sitting here in front of me today, I just want my own daughter to have that same opportunity.

02:38:58.620 --> 02:38:59.620
Thank you very much.

02:38:59.620 --> 02:39:00.620
Thank you.

02:39:00.620 --> 02:39:04.620
Applause

02:39:04.620 --> 02:39:06.620
Christina Cosgrove

02:39:17.620 --> 02:39:21.620
Hi, Christina Cosgrove. I live at 378 Schooner Lane in Berlin.

02:39:21.620 --> 02:39:25.620
I came here today to ask the question, what is a teacher worth?

02:39:25.620 --> 02:39:28.620
Everyone seems to have an opinion.

02:39:28.620 --> 02:39:34.620
As a teacher, but more importantly, as a parent to five Worcester County public school students,

02:39:34.620 --> 02:39:38.620
I am most interested in what is a Worcester County teacher worth.

02:39:38.620 --> 02:39:40.620
So I decided to go right to the source.

02:39:40.620 --> 02:39:44.620
I've collected 14 voices, one from every school in this county,

02:39:44.620 --> 02:39:49.620
to illustrate the way our teachers go above and beyond every day for our children.

02:39:49.620 --> 02:39:54.620
I will not have time to share them all, but I wanted to share a few.

02:39:54.620 --> 02:39:58.620
Worcester County has a teacher who dresses up as an old granny,

02:39:58.620 --> 02:40:01.620
complete with nightgown, rocking chair, and slippers,

02:40:01.620 --> 02:40:07.620
teaching characterization while creating a community that encourages confidence and risk-taking.

02:40:07.620 --> 02:40:11.620
Worcester County has a teacher who encourages sending postcards from vacations

02:40:11.620 --> 02:40:15.620
so that classmates can learn about the world from each other.

02:40:15.620 --> 02:40:20.620
Worcester County has a teacher who transforms carpet time into virtual field trips,

02:40:20.620 --> 02:40:23.620
that's so much better, using smart technology.

02:40:23.620 --> 02:40:27.620
Worcester County has a teacher who embraces families

02:40:27.620 --> 02:40:32.620
and sends home class news and school happenings in multiple languages.

02:40:32.620 --> 02:40:40.620
Worcester County has a teacher who had a 100% pass rate on the AP language and literature test.

02:40:40.620 --> 02:40:46.620
Worcester County has teachers who took a group of students to the SkillsUSA National Competition,

02:40:46.620 --> 02:40:52.620
where Worcester County students took the top 10 in the nation, scored within the top 10 in the nation.

02:40:52.620 --> 02:40:55.620
I could go on, but I'm being timed.

02:40:55.620 --> 02:41:01.620
So I ask you to ask yourself, what is a Worcester County teacher worth?

02:41:01.620 --> 02:41:09.620
What should it cost to recruit and retain the quality teachers that we need to shape the future of my children?

02:41:09.620 --> 02:41:14.620
This year I will have a child at Buckingham Elementary School, two at BIS,

02:41:14.620 --> 02:41:19.620
one at Stephen Decatur Middle School, and one at Stephen Decatur High School.

02:41:19.620 --> 02:41:25.620
Each of them deserve the best, and I hope that in the future my Board of Ed, their Board of Ed,

02:41:25.620 --> 02:41:33.620
will make financial decisions that show just how much a Worcester County teacher is worth to teachers, students, and our community.

02:41:33.620 --> 02:41:34.620
Thank you.

02:41:40.620 --> 02:41:42.620
Next up is Emily Gilman.

02:41:49.620 --> 02:41:50.620
Hi.

02:41:55.620 --> 02:41:58.620
My name is Emily Gilman. I live on Charleston Road.

02:41:58.620 --> 02:42:02.620
I have three wonderful kids all attending Chow Elementary.

02:42:02.620 --> 02:42:10.620
From volunteering, I get to watch the extra efforts that aren't always easy, but go a long way in the life of the school.

02:42:10.620 --> 02:42:15.620
I have watched Miss Dale, our custodian, help a student open a milk carton,

02:42:15.620 --> 02:42:19.620
only to clean it with a smile when it's promptly spilled.

02:42:19.620 --> 02:42:27.620
I have seen Mrs. Phillips and Mrs. Saracola in the front office, as excited as children for their positive achievements.

02:42:27.620 --> 02:42:33.620
I have heard EAs, like Miss Payne, offer to help when they have a precious 10 minutes to spare.

02:42:33.620 --> 02:42:41.620
I have seen Dr. Andes from this board bring his dog in for a student who really needed a positive interaction.

02:42:41.620 --> 02:42:47.620
I have seen countless parents deliver snacks, volunteer, and attend assemblies.

02:42:47.620 --> 02:42:55.620
I see dedicated, dedicated teachers adjusting lesson plans to meet the needs of all their students.

02:42:55.620 --> 02:43:03.620
In the name of fundraising, I watched Mr. Cowder willingly get cold water dumped on his head for an hour at Fall Festival.

02:43:03.620 --> 02:43:10.620
Chow has created a community so caring, I find extra duties to watch more.

02:43:10.620 --> 02:43:14.620
What I ultimately get to witness is alignment.

02:43:14.620 --> 02:43:19.620
I understand there are frustrated parents and educators.

02:43:19.620 --> 02:43:22.620
I have been a frustrated parent and probably will be again.

02:43:22.620 --> 02:43:25.620
And budgets will never go far enough.

02:43:25.620 --> 02:43:33.620
But everybody I mention, the custodians, support staff, bus drivers, parents, members of the board, we all have the same goal.

02:43:33.620 --> 02:43:38.620
We care deeply about the students, the staff, and the future of this community.

02:43:38.620 --> 02:43:44.620
There will always be challenges and different perspectives on how to navigate those challenges.

02:43:44.620 --> 02:43:46.620
But I truly believe we are aligned.

02:43:46.620 --> 02:43:49.620
I truly believe we have what it takes.

02:43:49.620 --> 02:43:51.620
And this needs to remain our focus.

02:43:51.620 --> 02:43:53.620
The students will not benefit otherwise.

02:43:53.620 --> 02:43:59.620
If we work together and listen to each other, all Worcester County students will thrive.

02:43:59.620 --> 02:44:02.620
And I can't wait to watch them.

02:44:02.620 --> 02:44:04.620
Thank you.

02:44:04.620 --> 02:44:09.620
Applause.

02:44:09.620 --> 02:44:10.620
Thank you.

02:44:10.620 --> 02:44:21.620
Next up, Audrey Winco.

02:44:21.620 --> 02:44:23.620
My name is Audrey Windsor.

02:44:23.620 --> 02:44:27.620
I reside at 8826 Old Ocean City Road in Berlin.

02:44:27.620 --> 02:44:34.620
My name is Audrey Windsor, and I currently have two children in second and fourth grade at Buckingham Elementary School.

02:44:34.620 --> 02:44:41.620
Additionally, I currently serve as the president of our PTA and work very closely with our Title I committee at school.

02:44:41.620 --> 02:44:55.620
Along with my older brother and father, who have all attended and graduated from Worcester County Public Schools, I am extremely proud of the fact that we have been members of this fantastic school system.

02:44:55.620 --> 02:45:14.620
My mother, Ginger Gillis, was a driving force in the new Worcester Career and Tech School, built so that students had a school to attend that they were proud of while being provided with everything they needed to be successful at the end of their program.

02:45:14.620 --> 02:45:20.620
She was also a driving force in getting lacrosse started at Stephen Decatur High School many years ago.

02:45:20.620 --> 02:45:31.620
This school system has always had a special place in my heart, and I cannot convey enough what a positive impact it has had on my family and I over the past and present years.

02:45:31.620 --> 02:45:42.620
I've worked in our local emergency room since I graduated Stephen Decatur over 20 years ago, thanks to the opportunity to attend the nursing program at Worcester Career and Tech Center.

02:45:42.620 --> 02:45:48.620
While working in the ER, I have the opportunity to talk with my patients and develop relationships with them.

02:45:48.620 --> 02:45:57.620
And something that always makes me smile is when they tell me they moved here because of how wonderful our school system is and that they wanted the best education for their children.

02:45:59.620 --> 02:46:08.620
I now worry about those families who moved here for the best education in the state and for those families who are heavily rooted in Worcester County as well.

02:46:08.620 --> 02:46:15.620
As we continue to hear the news of budget cuts and lack of funding that will greatly impact these students and families.

02:46:15.620 --> 02:46:22.620
I know for myself what a positive impact Summer Academy and the before and after school programs have had for my children.

02:46:22.620 --> 02:46:30.620
As I am the first to admit they suffered academically during COVID shutdowns and it was those programs that aided them in getting back to grade level.

02:46:30.620 --> 02:46:39.620
I know this year is going to be difficult, but let's not lose sight of the fact that we are still Worcester County Public Schools and we are proud to be here. Thank you.

02:46:39.620 --> 02:46:40.620
Thank you.

02:46:40.620 --> 02:46:41.620
Thank you.

02:46:44.620 --> 02:46:47.620
Next up is Susan Ostrowski.

02:46:52.620 --> 02:46:53.620
Good afternoon.

02:46:53.620 --> 02:46:54.620
Good afternoon.

02:46:54.620 --> 02:46:56.620
Susan Ostrowski, Berlin.

02:46:56.620 --> 02:47:04.620
I am very concerned with the pornographic material that is lurking inside our public school libraries.

02:47:04.620 --> 02:47:09.620
The three books I asked for a review, I read two cover to cover.

02:47:09.620 --> 02:47:11.620
They are not self-help books.

02:47:11.620 --> 02:47:16.620
They are books on rape, incest, oral, anal, and vaginal sex.

02:47:16.620 --> 02:47:19.620
These are books and are very disturbing.

02:47:19.620 --> 02:47:22.620
They're trying to make the abnormal normal.

02:47:22.620 --> 02:47:33.620
All Boys Aren't Blue is written in my opinion by a mentally disturbed man who is raped by a cousin, loved it, and is trying to make it normal in everyday occurrence.

02:47:33.620 --> 02:47:36.620
This how-to book was cathartic for him to write.

02:47:36.620 --> 02:47:45.620
In The Kite Runner, which is actually a well-written book, it's not for children to see Afghanis rape street children on a daily occurrence.

02:47:45.620 --> 02:47:47.620
That's not normal.

02:47:47.620 --> 02:47:51.620
And on A Court of Thorns and Roses, I couldn't get through.

02:47:51.620 --> 02:48:04.620
It descriptively depicts a child being sexually assaulted by wood nymph fairies, stripped of clothing, bathed naked, then having her naked body painted by nymphs.

02:48:04.620 --> 02:48:07.620
Children are the future of this country.

02:48:07.620 --> 02:48:14.620
We must keep them in the common sense, normal world, not the abnormal sexual occurrences.

02:48:14.620 --> 02:48:19.620
I asked the Worcester County Public Schools to conduct three book reviews on the three books I read.

02:48:19.620 --> 02:48:24.620
I promptly received a response from Ms. Sills, coordinator of the instruction.

02:48:24.620 --> 02:48:32.620
In her email, I was informed, I've got no stake in the game since I've got no school-age kids.

02:48:32.620 --> 02:48:37.620
I cannot vote until I own property, is the way I understand it.

02:48:37.620 --> 02:48:42.620
That's not what a taxpayer wants to hear as someone who pays your salary.

02:48:42.620 --> 02:48:45.620
Commissioner Karen Abbott addressed this matter last year.

02:48:45.620 --> 02:48:48.620
She had a different outcome than mine.

02:48:48.620 --> 02:48:55.620
So you need my tax money for who knows what, but I'm told to pipe down and take a seat.

02:48:55.620 --> 02:48:59.620
Listen to yourselves. Is this really your policy?

02:48:59.620 --> 02:49:04.620
This reply is unacceptable, and that's all I've got for today.

02:49:04.620 --> 02:49:09.620
Thank you.

02:49:09.620 --> 02:49:14.620
Kate McCloskey?

02:49:14.620 --> 02:49:18.620
Good afternoon. I'm Kate McCloskey from Ocean Pines.

02:49:18.620 --> 02:49:23.620
I wanted to share my experience with the book, the request for a book review policy as well,

02:49:23.620 --> 02:49:26.620
just so everyone knows what I had gone through recently.

02:49:26.620 --> 02:49:32.620
Last year, March of 2022, I had called the head librarian because I was concerned about

02:49:32.620 --> 02:49:38.620
the amount of sexual obscenity contained in a particular book that was in the school libraries,

02:49:38.620 --> 02:49:43.620
and Ms. Sills told me that there was a request for review of a book form

02:49:43.620 --> 02:49:46.620
that I needed to fill out and submit, which I did,

02:49:46.620 --> 02:49:49.620
and Ms. Sills replied in an email that the book review committee met

02:49:49.620 --> 02:49:53.620
and unanimously decided to keep that book in our school libraries.

02:49:53.620 --> 02:50:00.620
I was doing research on Maryland criminal law, Title 11, Subtitle 2, Section 11-203,

02:50:00.620 --> 02:50:06.620
and it prohibits the display of sexually obscene items, including books, to minors.

02:50:06.620 --> 02:50:14.620
The law defines obscene as items or books that include erotic touching, sexual intercourse,

02:50:14.620 --> 02:50:19.620
sodomy, et cetera, et cetera, which this particular book had all of these.

02:50:19.620 --> 02:50:23.620
And I was shocked that the committee unanimously agreed to keep this book.

02:50:23.620 --> 02:50:27.620
It made me wonder who was on the committee and how I could get on it.

02:50:27.620 --> 02:50:33.620
Since then, I've identified 49 books and counting that have come into our school libraries,

02:50:33.620 --> 02:50:36.620
I believe, during the pandemic years, I'm not quite sure,

02:50:36.620 --> 02:50:40.620
but they include sexually obscene material as defined in this same Maryland law,

02:50:40.620 --> 02:50:44.620
and I'd like to note that some of these books include violent gang rape scenes

02:50:44.620 --> 02:50:47.620
and pedophilia, sex scenes.

02:50:47.620 --> 02:50:51.620
And I bet excerpts from these books wouldn't even be able to be printed in our local newspapers.

02:50:51.620 --> 02:50:55.620
We're talking about content that's well beyond our rated movies

02:50:55.620 --> 02:51:00.620
into the X-rated material that's available right now in our school libraries.

02:51:00.620 --> 02:51:06.620
And now I hear that the board changed the policy, the request for a review of book policy,

02:51:06.620 --> 02:51:12.620
where you're only allowing parents, employees, or students to now fill those forms out.

02:51:12.620 --> 02:51:16.620
My husband and I are Worcester County taxpayers, property owners, and business owners

02:51:16.620 --> 02:51:21.620
for 18 years. Our three daughters have already graduated from Stephen Decatur.

02:51:21.620 --> 02:51:24.620
So while my kids are graduated, I care about other people's kids.

02:51:24.620 --> 02:51:27.620
That's why I'm here today and why I come to a lot of these meetings.

02:51:27.620 --> 02:51:30.620
So to wrap up, I just want to know when the policy changed and why.

02:51:30.620 --> 02:51:34.620
And since I'm no longer able to submit these forms,

02:51:34.620 --> 02:51:38.620
I just want to go on record to say I'm concerned about the amount of sexually explicit books

02:51:38.620 --> 02:51:42.620
that are being allowed on our school library shelves. Thank you.

02:51:42.620 --> 02:51:44.620
Thank you.

02:51:46.620 --> 02:51:48.620
Next up is Pat Barberley.

02:51:54.620 --> 02:51:56.620
Hi, Pat Barberley, Newark, Maryland.

02:51:56.620 --> 02:52:00.620
I, too, have been reviewing some of the books in Worcester County

02:52:00.620 --> 02:52:03.620
and struggle to get through them.

02:52:03.620 --> 02:52:09.620
I've been married for 47 years, and I'm being introduced to things that I just didn't even know about.

02:52:09.620 --> 02:52:14.620
I can't believe we're introducing these things and giving ideas to our children.

02:52:14.620 --> 02:52:19.620
If my husband or someone else were to read some of the content to a child,

02:52:19.620 --> 02:52:22.620
I think they'd probably be arrested.

02:52:22.620 --> 02:52:27.620
But if it's done as an educational thing, it seems to be okay as education.

02:52:27.620 --> 02:52:31.620
I agree with the comments made by Ms. Mikowski and Ms. Ostrovsky.

02:52:31.620 --> 02:52:35.620
I'm a concerned taxpayer. I don't have a child in school right now.

02:52:35.620 --> 02:52:41.620
But I feel that I should have the opportunity to comment and ask for a review of these books.

02:52:41.620 --> 02:52:49.620
I hope that the board members that are sitting up here are reading these books that we're talking about.

02:52:49.620 --> 02:52:52.620
If you haven't, you should. Thank you.

02:52:52.620 --> 02:52:54.620
Thank you.

02:52:55.620 --> 02:52:57.620
Next up is Tristan Melvin.

02:53:06.620 --> 02:53:10.620
Hello. Thank you. I'm Tristan Melvin.

02:53:10.620 --> 02:53:14.620
I'm from Pocomoke, 561 Ocean Highway.

02:53:14.620 --> 02:53:19.620
First, I'd like to commend those who came and spoke for themselves and for others.

02:53:19.620 --> 02:53:22.620
Due to recent events, I found myself before you all today.

02:53:22.620 --> 02:53:29.620
I am Tristan Melvin, student at Pocomoke High School and student board representative for the Worcester County Board of Education.

02:53:30.620 --> 02:53:36.620
Though I hold these titles, I am here to speak as more than a student, more than a representative.

02:53:36.620 --> 02:53:41.620
I'm here to speak as a human, as an equal to you all.

02:53:41.620 --> 02:53:45.620
While serving my time on the board, I've already experienced the ugly side of the education system.

02:53:45.620 --> 02:53:50.620
I've seen hate, bigotry, and exclusion all within the community we live in and cherish dearly,

02:53:50.620 --> 02:53:54.620
not from the Board of Education, from people outside.

02:53:54.620 --> 02:53:58.620
Principal Jennifer Rain of Pocomoke High School has been more than a principal.

02:53:58.620 --> 02:54:03.620
Mrs. Rain is like a mother, a friend, and a teacher in one amazing package.

02:54:03.620 --> 02:54:07.620
But most importantly, she's an inspiration.

02:54:08.620 --> 02:54:12.620
I turned to Ms. Rain after seeing the hate spread around our community,

02:54:12.620 --> 02:54:17.620
and I saw she was battling the negativity with inclusivity and love for all students.

02:54:17.620 --> 02:54:21.620
It's been brought to my attention that as of late, Jennifer Rain and all of Pocomoke High School,

02:54:21.620 --> 02:54:25.620
especially the wonderful club of Speak Up, has been under attack.

02:54:25.620 --> 02:54:30.620
And I'm here to ask respectfully that we just allow others to be free.

02:54:30.620 --> 02:54:35.620
Inclusivity, intersectionality, and diversity is not harming anybody.

02:54:35.620 --> 02:54:41.620
And the one spreading those values is the one administrator that deserves and has been awarded for her work.

02:54:41.620 --> 02:54:46.620
Jennifer Rain, Pocomoke High School, and Speak Up aren't going anywhere anytime soon,

02:54:46.620 --> 02:54:49.620
so please find it in your hearts to accept diversity and inclusion.

02:54:49.620 --> 02:54:53.620
Because if you care for the students of Worcester County, you know that's what's best for them.

02:54:53.620 --> 02:54:58.620
There are bigger issues than inclusivity. We should not be concerned about gaining a flag policy.

02:54:58.620 --> 02:55:02.620
We should concern ourselves with the real things and people providing educational disruption.

02:55:02.620 --> 02:55:06.620
Not a flag, not a book. Some books are not the issue. You might be.

02:55:06.620 --> 02:55:11.620
And remember, this is a student saying this. I am someone's kid. This is what I believe.

02:55:11.620 --> 02:55:14.620
Please get a student perspective before concerning.

02:55:14.620 --> 02:55:21.620
Some traumatic experiences must be heard. Stop silencing trauma-instilled voices. Stop silencing voices at all.

02:55:21.620 --> 02:55:26.620
I commend Jennifer Rain, my principal and my biggest mentor. So much love to her.

02:55:26.620 --> 02:55:30.620
Please continue to Speak Up for yourself and others. That's all Speak Up teaches.

02:55:30.620 --> 02:55:33.620
Not the conspiracies some have created in their head.

02:55:33.620 --> 02:55:35.620
Thank you.

02:55:35.620 --> 02:55:37.620
Thank you.

02:55:44.620 --> 02:55:47.620
Just a quick comment, Mrs. Strasky and Ms. McCloskey.

02:55:47.620 --> 02:55:50.620
I'll make sure that you, we have not changed the policy.

02:55:50.620 --> 02:55:55.620
But I'll make sure that you'll get a copy of that policy e-mailed to you so that you can review it.

02:55:55.620 --> 02:55:57.620
Okay?

02:55:57.620 --> 02:55:59.620
You're welcome.

02:55:59.620 --> 02:56:02.620
Okay. Moving forward. Thank everybody for their comments.

02:56:02.620 --> 02:56:08.620
Moving forward, I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Annette Wallace for our international field trip request.

02:56:08.620 --> 02:56:19.620
Good afternoon. I'd like to welcome Mr. Philip Cropper this morning from Wister Technical High School who has a presentation.

02:56:38.620 --> 02:57:07.620
All right.

02:57:07.620 --> 02:57:13.620
I'm Philip Cropper from Wister Technical High School. Everybody knows me as Chef Cropper.

02:57:13.620 --> 02:57:18.620
So I was reached out by Chuck Wallace from MSDE last October.

02:57:18.620 --> 02:57:22.620
There's a thing called Sister Cities in Maryland, which I just learned about.

02:57:22.620 --> 02:57:24.620
And there's five different sister cities.

02:57:24.620 --> 02:57:33.620
One is in Lille, France, which is in northern France near, this is just playing nonstop, near Belgium.

02:57:33.620 --> 02:57:45.620
And they reached out to MSDE and said, we want a Maryland high school to do an exchange with us.

02:57:45.620 --> 02:57:50.620
So Chuck Wallace reached out to me and said, you are an exemplar ACF culinary arts program.

02:57:50.620 --> 02:57:53.620
Could you please, you know, reach out and look into this?

02:57:53.620 --> 02:57:55.620
Is it something that you would be interested in doing?

02:57:55.620 --> 02:57:59.620
And I said, certainly we would love to be part of it if we could.

02:58:00.620 --> 02:58:05.620
And here we are today.

02:58:05.620 --> 02:58:16.620
So after about a year of meetings back and forth, most of them virtual with the Department of Commerce, MSDE, and with the dean from the school in France.

02:58:16.620 --> 02:58:26.620
Here we are with this presentation.

02:58:26.620 --> 02:58:27.620
He's a really good chef.

02:58:27.620 --> 02:58:28.620
I had it all set up.

02:58:28.620 --> 02:58:30.620
I don't know why it's not working.

02:58:30.620 --> 02:58:31.620
All right.

02:58:31.620 --> 02:58:32.620
There we go.

02:58:32.620 --> 02:58:33.620
There you go.

02:58:33.620 --> 02:58:34.620
I now have an assistant.

02:58:34.620 --> 02:58:35.620
Perfect.

02:58:35.620 --> 02:58:45.620
So the idea is to have eight students in grades 11 through 12 who are enrolled in the culinary and pastry arts program at Wister Technical High School to go to France for 10 days.

02:58:45.620 --> 02:58:47.620
And then students from France come here for 10 days.

02:58:47.620 --> 02:58:50.620
So the way it would work is we would have students come to us first.

02:58:50.620 --> 02:58:52.620
It would be eight students, two adults.

02:58:52.620 --> 02:58:57.620
They would spend a total of 10 days, five roughly in school with the students.

02:58:57.620 --> 02:58:58.620
It would be a complete exchange.

02:58:58.620 --> 02:59:07.620
And the rest of the time would be two days of transportation, one here and one back, and then seeing other cities and landmarks in the area and how they tie together.

02:59:07.620 --> 02:59:11.620
The average cost would be about $2,500 per student.

02:59:11.620 --> 02:59:19.620
We're coming up with that fee from passports and airfare because the students would actually be housed in a hotel there that's owned by the school.

02:59:19.620 --> 02:59:25.620
And here we have a local hotel in Ocean City, the sea bay, that has offered to house the students from France.

02:59:25.620 --> 02:59:29.620
Originally, we wanted to do an exchange where students would live with other students.

02:59:29.620 --> 02:59:36.620
But we thought just it might be a little bit better and safer to be in a hotel than with other families.

02:59:36.620 --> 02:59:39.620
Yeah, the next one.

02:59:39.620 --> 02:59:40.620
All right.

02:59:40.620 --> 02:59:42.620
So a little it's basically in the northern France.

02:59:42.620 --> 02:59:46.620
It's about about an hour train ride to Paris.

02:59:46.620 --> 02:59:48.620
So we can go right into Belgium.

02:59:48.620 --> 02:59:50.620
It's a culinary hub in France.

02:59:50.620 --> 02:59:56.620
The school that's there, they're called colleges, but it's actually a high school, has about 560 kids.

02:59:56.620 --> 03:00:00.620
You can go to the next one and 250 apprentices.

03:00:00.620 --> 03:00:07.620
So there are about two years, two to three years ahead of us with the apprenticeship program, which we just kicked off last year.

03:00:07.620 --> 03:00:11.620
And the school is mainly a hospitality and culinary arts school.

03:00:11.620 --> 03:00:17.620
So I wanted with us being the first time I wanted them to come to us first to kind of see what we're getting into.

03:00:17.620 --> 03:00:21.620
Have a week in between so we can kind of work out any bugs that we might need to.

03:00:21.620 --> 03:00:26.620
And then we would go over to France for for the 10 days.

03:00:26.620 --> 03:00:31.620
We talked about where the students would say they're going to explore, eat, network, learn.

03:00:31.620 --> 03:00:36.620
They're also going to learn five days in class and then two days of traveling.

03:00:36.620 --> 03:00:39.620
And we're going to have round the clock safety.

03:00:39.620 --> 03:00:43.620
So what this means is 24-7 bilingual dean, instructor on call.

03:00:43.620 --> 03:00:45.620
We're going to have student travel insurance.

03:00:45.620 --> 03:00:49.620
The cost of the student travel insurance is as low as about one hundred dollars per student.

03:00:49.620 --> 03:00:51.620
And that's through a second party agency.

03:00:51.620 --> 03:00:55.620
That's through MSCE phone tree and mobile tracking.

03:00:55.620 --> 03:00:59.620
We're going to have MSCE State Department travel advisories and updates the whole time.

03:00:59.620 --> 03:01:05.620
Chaperone ratio is one to four, which county policy is one to ten for out of county.

03:01:05.620 --> 03:01:11.620
And then we have an agreement between MSCE, Little France and the State Department of Commerce.

03:01:11.620 --> 03:01:13.620
We're going to do a project.

03:01:13.620 --> 03:01:17.620
So we're going to do a written component where the kids are going to have to write an essay, PowerPoint or Prezi.

03:01:17.620 --> 03:01:23.620
And then they're also going to have to do an oral presentation so we can include the whole student body of the program of 36 kids.

03:01:23.620 --> 03:01:27.620
But we need to limit it down to just eight for feasibility of travel.

03:01:27.620 --> 03:01:31.620
And then just some pictures to finish. That's it.

03:01:31.620 --> 03:01:34.620
So that's our proposal. We're looking to do it late March, early spring.

03:01:34.620 --> 03:01:39.620
Or early April. I want to try to avoid winter weather and snow delays.

03:01:39.620 --> 03:01:45.620
But I want to get in before all the spring issues of, you know, graduations and sports and award ceremonies.

03:01:45.620 --> 03:01:48.620
So it's all still up in the air right now. We do have a contract.

03:01:48.620 --> 03:01:51.620
I included a copy of that with the board documents.

03:01:51.620 --> 03:01:55.620
I have not signed the contract yet because I wanted approval before we did it.

03:01:55.620 --> 03:02:03.620
But once if this gets approved, then we're going to move forward in October with another meeting with all parties involved to get it planned for the fall.

03:02:03.620 --> 03:02:04.620
Okay. Or the spring.

03:02:04.620 --> 03:02:08.620
So does Mr. Cropper seek your approval through the superintendent of this district?

03:02:08.620 --> 03:02:11.620
Sure. Does anyone have any questions for Mr. Cropper regarding this trip?

03:02:11.620 --> 03:02:12.620
Yeah.

03:02:12.620 --> 03:02:13.620
Mr. Buchanan?

03:02:13.620 --> 03:02:21.620
Do you have all the chaperones packed out yet?

03:02:21.620 --> 03:02:26.620
So basically we would need two chaperones. One would be an administrator for the county and then myself.

03:02:26.620 --> 03:02:32.620
So we could maybe have some extra funding and some extra board members tag along.

03:02:32.620 --> 03:02:35.620
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Buchanan. Any other questions?

03:02:35.620 --> 03:02:36.620
Mr. Gordy?

03:02:36.620 --> 03:02:44.620
Dr. Wallace, obviously you have a hand in this. This is pretty new, pretty sudden.

03:02:44.620 --> 03:02:48.620
What did your research show here? We're venturing into...

03:02:48.620 --> 03:02:52.620
Yes. I'm very excited about it.

03:02:52.620 --> 03:02:57.620
Mr. Chef Cropper met with me several months ago now and we talked about how to best move forward.

03:02:57.620 --> 03:03:05.620
Again, I think this is another feather in our cap, feather in his cap, as if his cap could hold any more feathers, honestly.

03:03:05.620 --> 03:03:08.620
He probably has one of the most of any staff member.

03:03:08.620 --> 03:03:16.620
Because MSD each reached out to us and said, hey, we want to start doing this with the trades and we want to start with Chef Cropper in his program.

03:03:17.620 --> 03:03:19.620
For me, it was exciting.

03:03:19.620 --> 03:03:25.620
And Mr. Zimmer said he didn't want to go, so I thought you already had your administrator, but apparently now it's up in the air.

03:03:25.620 --> 03:03:27.620
I thought he was taking me.

03:03:27.620 --> 03:03:30.620
Dr. Phillips and I will fight about it, I guess. I don't know.

03:03:30.620 --> 03:03:33.620
But no, I think it's a great opportunity.

03:03:33.620 --> 03:03:36.620
I've been working with Mr. Cropper on the safety aspects.

03:03:36.620 --> 03:03:41.620
I think that was a major concern for me and I feel good about it.

03:03:41.620 --> 03:03:44.620
So I feel good bringing this to Mr. Taylor to bring to you all.

03:03:45.620 --> 03:03:47.620
Any other questions for Chef Cropper?

03:03:47.620 --> 03:03:51.620
How are the students selected, the eight students that would be selected for it?

03:03:51.620 --> 03:03:53.620
So I get new students every year.

03:03:53.620 --> 03:03:55.620
So my program is a one-year program.

03:03:55.620 --> 03:03:57.620
You can take your junior or senior year.

03:03:57.620 --> 03:04:00.620
So that's why we've kind of put it on hold until we get the new group of students this year.

03:04:00.620 --> 03:04:10.620
Once we're going to have a parent meeting the second week of school, which I do every year to go over basic cost of culinary arts, the curriculum, what's involved with the program because of the safety aspect.

03:04:10.620 --> 03:04:14.620
At that meeting I'm going to introduce this trip if it's approved so parents are aware of it.

03:04:14.620 --> 03:04:17.620
And then we're going to have kids sign up by interest.

03:04:17.620 --> 03:04:24.620
And then we'll have throughout the school year, it's going to be, you know, you're going to have to maintain your standards with your testing.

03:04:24.620 --> 03:04:25.620
You're going to have to keep your grade up.

03:04:25.620 --> 03:04:29.620
You're going to have to help with the activities to be able to qualify to go on the trip.

03:04:29.620 --> 03:04:36.620
And then if we don't have enough students from this year, we're going to go back to students that completed last year as a junior that's now a senior in the county,

03:04:37.620 --> 03:04:40.620
and ask them if they're interested in going on the trip.

03:04:40.620 --> 03:04:48.620
And then as far as funding, I mean, we did a pop-up booth at the Berlin Peach Festival just two weeks ago and we did $3,800 in one day.

03:04:48.620 --> 03:04:50.620
So, I mean, we have a lot of community support.

03:04:50.620 --> 03:04:58.620
You know, I don't think we're going to have a problem there with funding the trip aspect of it.

03:04:58.620 --> 03:05:01.620
Should this get approved, though, we are accepting donations today.

03:05:01.620 --> 03:05:04.620
So we will take cash or check or Phil and I both have Venmo.

03:05:05.620 --> 03:05:07.620
We're always taking money.

03:05:07.620 --> 03:05:12.620
And the nice thing is when I said MSE, I said, why are you guys coming to us when there's other schools across the bridge?

03:05:12.620 --> 03:05:18.620
And the nice thing about Worcester Tech Culinary is we are an ACF accredited program through the Maricopa Culinary Federation.

03:05:18.620 --> 03:05:23.620
And we are one of three programs in the state of Maryland to be dual accredited.

03:05:23.620 --> 03:05:28.620
And we're one of two to be an exemplar program in the state of Maryland.

03:05:28.620 --> 03:05:29.620
Sounds great.

03:05:29.620 --> 03:05:35.620
So do I have any other questions for Chef Cropper?

03:05:35.620 --> 03:05:38.620
I know I have a lot of volunteers up here going on the trip.

03:05:38.620 --> 03:05:40.620
Any other questions?

03:05:40.620 --> 03:05:43.620
So just a quick comment.

03:05:43.620 --> 03:05:47.620
Please remember the lead time to get a passport now.

03:05:47.620 --> 03:05:51.620
There's significant lead time to get a passport.

03:05:51.620 --> 03:05:55.620
If you've tried to renew a passport, you know it's three to six months.

03:05:55.620 --> 03:06:03.620
So just as a point of caution, you may want to think about if a student does not have a passport or an expired passport,

03:06:03.620 --> 03:06:08.620
it's going to be necessary for them to start that application process pretty soon.

03:06:08.620 --> 03:06:09.620
Yeah.

03:06:09.620 --> 03:06:10.620
And we did.

03:06:10.620 --> 03:06:14.620
I did reach out to City Hall and Ocean City because they do passports right there in the City Hall office.

03:06:14.620 --> 03:06:19.620
And they said that they would set time aside to do all the kids at one time for us.

03:06:19.620 --> 03:06:21.620
So can I have anybody else?

03:06:21.620 --> 03:06:23.620
Anyone else have any other comments?

03:06:23.620 --> 03:06:25.620
Dr. Innis, do you still have something?

03:06:25.620 --> 03:06:26.620
No.

03:06:26.620 --> 03:06:27.620
So moved to approve.

03:06:27.620 --> 03:06:28.620
Okay.

03:06:28.620 --> 03:06:29.620
So I have a motion by Dr. Innis.

03:06:29.620 --> 03:06:33.620
First of all, a motion to approve the Worcester Technical High School Culinary International Field Trip Request.

03:06:33.620 --> 03:06:34.620
I have a motion by Dr. Innis.

03:06:34.620 --> 03:06:35.620
Do I have a second?

03:06:35.620 --> 03:06:36.620
Second.

03:06:36.620 --> 03:06:37.620
A second by Mr. Gordy.

03:06:37.620 --> 03:06:38.620
All in favor?

03:06:38.620 --> 03:06:39.620
Aye.

03:06:39.620 --> 03:06:40.620
Any opposed?

03:06:40.620 --> 03:06:41.620
Thank you so much.

03:06:41.620 --> 03:06:42.620
Thank you, Chef Cropper.

03:06:42.620 --> 03:06:50.620
Thank you, Principal Zimmer.

03:06:50.620 --> 03:06:55.620
So now moving on to special education staffing plan, I'm going to turn it over to Ms. Schwartz.

03:06:55.620 --> 03:06:57.620
Thank you, Mr. Fronte.

03:06:57.620 --> 03:07:04.620
And Wendy and I have no trips planned, but we do have an approval item for our staffing report for special education.

03:07:04.620 --> 03:07:10.620
Through COMAR, we are required to do this presentation each year and seek the board's approval.

03:07:10.620 --> 03:07:15.620
So I'll turn it over to Ms. Wendy Phillips, who is our supervisor of special education.

03:07:15.620 --> 03:07:16.620
Welcome, Ms. Phillips.

03:07:16.620 --> 03:07:17.620
Nice to see you.

03:07:17.620 --> 03:07:42.620
Hello, everyone.

03:07:42.620 --> 03:07:43.620
Hello.

03:07:43.620 --> 03:07:44.620
How's everybody doing?

03:07:44.620 --> 03:07:45.620
Doing great.

03:07:45.620 --> 03:07:46.620
Yes, speaking to the right, please.

03:07:46.620 --> 03:07:52.620
Wendy, talk right into it, please.

03:07:52.620 --> 03:07:53.620
Hi, I'm Wendy Phillips.

03:07:53.620 --> 03:07:55.620
I'm the supervisor of special education.

03:07:55.620 --> 03:08:04.620
I'm going to present to you today a presentation about the Worcester County 2023-2024 staffing plan.

03:08:04.620 --> 03:08:11.620
So each year I prepare a little presentation just to give you a little bit of information about special education because it's so in depth and there's so much information.

03:08:11.620 --> 03:08:15.620
So you already have the staffing plan in front of you, I'm sure.

03:08:15.620 --> 03:08:17.620
And here's just some information to help you.

03:08:17.620 --> 03:08:21.620
So, understand.

03:08:21.620 --> 03:08:23.620
So how is the staffing plan developed?

03:08:23.620 --> 03:08:25.620
This is a year-long process.

03:08:25.620 --> 03:08:28.620
It starts in September with child count.

03:08:28.620 --> 03:08:36.620
So we, our data manager, counts all the students that receive special education services and their disabilities.

03:08:36.620 --> 03:08:40.620
That report is sent to MSDE in October.

03:08:41.620 --> 03:08:51.620
When that report is finished, I meet with finance and we go through every single employee in Worcester County and see if they are working with special education.

03:08:51.620 --> 03:08:55.620
They are included within a report that is sent in May.

03:08:55.620 --> 03:08:58.620
So we work on that report from November to March.

03:08:58.620 --> 03:09:04.620
When that is happening, during that November to March period, we are looking at caseloads.

03:09:04.620 --> 03:09:07.620
We're looking at teachers, students, new students moving in.

03:09:07.620 --> 03:09:12.620
Any new request, I will meet with principals and then we meet with the exec team.

03:09:12.620 --> 03:09:22.620
And then in May, when the budget is proposed, a formal request for additional staffing is also made at that time.

03:09:22.620 --> 03:09:31.620
Okay, so this slide tells you some of the IDEA mandates that impact the staffing plan.

03:09:31.620 --> 03:09:35.620
So all children are entitled to appropriate assessments.

03:09:35.620 --> 03:09:42.620
That could be a cognitive assessment, an educational assessment, a speech and language assessment, behavior assessment, many different assessments.

03:09:42.620 --> 03:09:45.620
So they are entitled to appropriate assessments.

03:09:45.620 --> 03:09:52.620
They're also entitled to a FAPE or a free and appropriate public education to meet their unique needs.

03:09:52.620 --> 03:09:59.620
We discover their unique needs with looking at their present levels and their cognitive and their educational assessments.

03:09:59.620 --> 03:10:04.620
Services can begin at birth and go through age 21.

03:10:04.620 --> 03:10:07.620
That will be part C.

03:10:07.620 --> 03:10:16.620
Services can also start at age 3 and go to age 21, and that is part B, which is counterintuitive.

03:10:16.620 --> 03:10:25.620
So if a child wants to stay on part C, they can get an extended family service plan.

03:10:25.620 --> 03:10:29.620
That is goals related to family actions.

03:10:29.620 --> 03:10:34.620
An IEP is more school level, and that's age 3 to 21.

03:10:34.620 --> 03:10:39.620
All children are entitled to an education in the least restrictive environment.

03:10:39.620 --> 03:10:47.620
This is a continuum of services that we must provide, and children have to have access to the general education curriculum.

03:10:47.620 --> 03:10:50.620
This happened with the reauthorization in 1997.

03:10:50.620 --> 03:10:57.620
Many of you probably went to school when children with special needs went into a resource room, and that's where they stayed.

03:10:57.620 --> 03:10:59.620
They found that that doesn't work.

03:10:59.620 --> 03:11:07.620
In 1997, when it was reauthorized, a push for results for special education happened, which is great.

03:11:07.620 --> 03:11:13.620
Children also are determined to need SDI, which is specially designed instruction.

03:11:13.620 --> 03:11:24.620
They must qualify on a two-prong approach for special education, one of the 14 disability categories, and a need for SDI.

03:11:24.620 --> 03:11:34.620
Then ESY is also provided to children, and that is if a child is not going to meet their IEP goals during the school year,

03:11:34.620 --> 03:11:38.620
they can get ESY, and we provide them instruction during the school year.

03:11:38.620 --> 03:11:40.620
That is required.

03:11:40.620 --> 03:11:43.620
Transportation is required, and they are required to have that.

03:11:43.620 --> 03:11:46.620
Not all kids, but a lot of kids.

03:11:46.620 --> 03:11:51.620
Child find is one of the guiding pushes.

03:11:51.620 --> 03:11:56.620
Actually, it's probably one of the foundational elements of IDEA.

03:11:56.620 --> 03:12:01.620
We are required to identify, locate, and evaluate any child that is suspected of having a disability.

03:12:01.620 --> 03:12:07.620
When you look at the definition there, you kind of think, who is eligible?

03:12:07.620 --> 03:12:15.620
Well, anyone that resides in Worcester County Public Schools is eligible to be assessed and receive services if they're determined to have a disability.

03:12:15.620 --> 03:12:23.620
Also, children that go to private schools are eligible to be assessed.

03:12:23.620 --> 03:12:25.620
So who do we serve in Worcester County?

03:12:25.620 --> 03:12:28.620
We do a great job serving our students here in Worcester County.

03:12:28.620 --> 03:12:34.620
We have 121 Part Cs, Part Cs in blue up on the screen, students right now, children.

03:12:34.620 --> 03:12:38.620
They're birth to three, some are three and four, actually.

03:12:38.620 --> 03:12:41.620
And then we have 753 active IEPs.

03:12:41.620 --> 03:12:44.620
Our Part C is the largest it's ever been.

03:12:44.620 --> 03:12:49.620
We are at the largest we've ever been in the history of Worcester County at this time.

03:12:49.620 --> 03:12:53.620
So who are the children that we service?

03:12:53.620 --> 03:12:59.620
Well, our primary disabilities, you can see that the chart shows the breakdown of the primary disabilities in Worcester County.

03:12:59.620 --> 03:13:07.620
Worcester County has approximately 11% of our student population that we service with disabilities.

03:13:07.620 --> 03:13:13.620
And the state of Maryland has 12%, so we're just right in tow with the state of Maryland.

03:13:13.620 --> 03:13:20.620
And if you look at our disability categories, speech and language, SLD and OHI are the three highest,

03:13:20.620 --> 03:13:24.620
and that is actually the same as the federal numbers.

03:13:24.620 --> 03:13:31.620
The federal numbers, that's about 66% of the federal, the whole entire United States, and ours is 63%.

03:13:31.620 --> 03:13:34.620
So Worcester County is looking really good with our numbers where we are.

03:13:34.620 --> 03:13:39.620
We do have a larger amount of children with multiple disabilities in Worcester County public schools.

03:13:40.620 --> 03:13:47.620
The federal number is 2%, and we are at 11.2%.

03:13:47.620 --> 03:13:52.620
Multiple disabilities are children that have multiple disabilities,

03:13:52.620 --> 03:13:57.620
and we can't determine which disability has the most impact on the child.

03:13:57.620 --> 03:14:05.620
So that is a significant factor here in Worcester.

03:14:05.620 --> 03:14:08.620
So we have to provide a continuum of services.

03:14:08.620 --> 03:14:09.620
This is required.

03:14:09.620 --> 03:14:14.620
Students can receive services in the general education classroom,

03:14:14.620 --> 03:14:18.620
and that can be, the general education teacher can provide those services.

03:14:18.620 --> 03:14:22.620
That is at the very, that's LREA.

03:14:22.620 --> 03:14:28.620
And then we can also have, which the majority of our kids have in Worcester County, full inclusion,

03:14:28.620 --> 03:14:34.620
with supports in the classroom, and those services can be provided by a special educator, a general educator, or an EA.

03:14:34.620 --> 03:14:40.620
Then the next step, the more restrictive, would be services provided inside and outside of the classroom,

03:14:40.620 --> 03:14:43.620
separated from their gen ed peer.

03:14:43.620 --> 03:14:53.620
Then the most restrictive is a separate, public separate day school, or a special school, or a home and hospital education,

03:14:53.620 --> 03:15:01.620
and we also have to provide these children related services within all of these LREAs.

03:15:01.620 --> 03:15:04.620
So where are Worcester County's kids?

03:15:04.620 --> 03:15:06.620
We do really well.

03:15:06.620 --> 03:15:12.620
We exceed the state target of 71% for 80% or more in the general ed.

03:15:12.620 --> 03:15:14.620
We're at 84%, which is wonderful.

03:15:14.620 --> 03:15:18.620
You can see in blue the majority of our kids are served within the general education classroom,

03:15:18.620 --> 03:15:23.620
and that's what IDA mandates, and that's what our state department asks us to do as well.

03:15:23.620 --> 03:15:25.620
So what programs do we provide?

03:15:25.620 --> 03:15:31.620
Well, we have infants and toddlers, 0 to 3, and that was that 121 cases that we have right now.

03:15:31.620 --> 03:15:37.620
Itinerant services, those are services where people travel either to homes, daycares.

03:15:37.620 --> 03:15:41.620
They also, parents could bring the kids into the school and receive services.

03:15:41.620 --> 03:15:45.620
We provide services in preschools and head starts.

03:15:45.620 --> 03:15:48.620
Of course, there's services in all Worcester County public schools.

03:15:48.620 --> 03:15:50.620
We have about five kids in our RISE program right now.

03:15:50.620 --> 03:15:55.620
That's our program for children with emotional disabilities.

03:15:55.620 --> 03:15:58.620
We also have Cedar Chapel.

03:15:58.620 --> 03:16:05.620
Nonpublic schools, we have to provide, if a child is determined by the IEP team to need a nonpublic school,

03:16:05.620 --> 03:16:08.620
that would be a MANCEF school.

03:16:08.620 --> 03:16:10.620
We have to provide them with that.

03:16:10.620 --> 03:16:17.620
We have a secondary transition services work experiences program and parent support services as well.

03:16:18.620 --> 03:16:20.620
So here's some numbers for you.

03:16:20.620 --> 03:16:24.620
In early childhood, we had 167 referrals last year.

03:16:24.620 --> 03:16:28.620
This is the most we've ever seen in Worcester County as well.

03:16:28.620 --> 03:16:32.620
The process takes 45 days, and we had 167 of them.

03:16:32.620 --> 03:16:38.620
And think that team had to process 167 of those referrals over our school year as well.

03:16:38.620 --> 03:16:42.620
73 children, 0 to 3, are receiving services.

03:16:42.620 --> 03:16:45.620
15 are 3 and 4.

03:16:45.620 --> 03:16:53.620
And then 26 of our infants and toddlers are in the process of transitioning right now into our school age kids.

03:16:53.620 --> 03:17:01.620
Our school psychologist last year in Part B conducted 441 evaluations.

03:17:01.620 --> 03:17:03.620
That is a lot.

03:17:03.620 --> 03:17:07.620
That is four school psychologists, and that means they had over 100.

03:17:07.620 --> 03:17:14.620
Thankfully, we were able to hire another school psychologist to relieve the load on our school psychologist.

03:17:14.620 --> 03:17:18.620
We had 256 initial eligibility meetings.

03:17:18.620 --> 03:17:21.620
That is child find and private schools.

03:17:21.620 --> 03:17:26.620
We had 64 private school referrals, 30 children transitioned from infants and toddlers.

03:17:26.620 --> 03:17:31.620
Our special educators, the amazing special educators we heard the parents talking about,

03:17:31.620 --> 03:17:38.620
they provided 10,172 hours of education services weekly last year.

03:17:38.620 --> 03:17:43.620
118 of our students in Worcester County received ESY services.

03:17:43.620 --> 03:17:49.620
That means they were qualified by the IEP team to receive those summer ESY services.

03:17:49.620 --> 03:17:58.620
In our school employment programs, 19 students were employed for summer youth employment, which was wonderful.

03:17:58.620 --> 03:18:04.620
And 33 of our students were employed during the school year through our employment programs.

03:18:04.620 --> 03:18:11.620
So Worcester County also must remain under the 1% mandate for students participating in alternative assessments.

03:18:11.620 --> 03:18:19.620
Some students receive a Maryland certificate of program completion, and some students receive a high school diploma.

03:18:19.620 --> 03:18:24.620
753 students are receiving services in Worcester County right now, as I said before.

03:18:24.620 --> 03:18:32.620
60 of our students are pursuing a Maryland high school certificate of program completion, which keeps us under that 1% mandate.

03:18:32.620 --> 03:18:36.620
693 students are pursuing a high school diploma.

03:18:36.620 --> 03:18:41.620
And I'm just going to open it up for questions.

03:18:41.620 --> 03:18:43.620
Board members, that's a lot of information.

03:18:43.620 --> 03:18:45.620
That's a lot of hard work.

03:18:45.620 --> 03:18:48.620
Does any board members have any questions for Ms. Phillips?

03:18:48.620 --> 03:18:51.620
Mr. Buchanan?

03:18:51.620 --> 03:18:56.620
How many students do we have under outside placement right now?

03:18:56.620 --> 03:19:06.620
I want to say, I just looked up that number.

03:19:06.620 --> 03:19:08.620
I want to say 38.

03:19:08.620 --> 03:19:09.620
Outside placement, 38.

03:19:09.620 --> 03:19:10.620
Yes, I want to say 38.

03:19:10.620 --> 03:19:14.620
Okay, thank you.

03:19:14.620 --> 03:19:15.620
Any other questions?

03:19:15.620 --> 03:19:16.620
Yes, any other board members?

03:19:16.620 --> 03:19:17.620
That's okay.

03:19:17.620 --> 03:19:18.620
Any other board members have questions?

03:19:18.620 --> 03:19:20.620
Dr. Andes?

03:19:20.620 --> 03:19:24.620
Why do you ask me if there are any more questions than you look at me?

03:19:24.620 --> 03:19:25.620
No, I don't have any more questions.

03:19:25.620 --> 03:19:33.620
I just want to commend Wendy and the entire leadership team and the entire group of special educators, school psychologists, occupational therapists,

03:19:33.620 --> 03:19:39.620
physical therapists, speech therapists, and everyone who makes a difference in the lives of the children that you serve.

03:19:39.620 --> 03:19:49.620
So thank you for doing an outstanding job leading the program, making a difference for every single child who has a special need or learning challenge.

03:19:49.620 --> 03:19:50.620
Thank you.

03:19:50.620 --> 03:19:51.620
Thank you so much, Dr. Andes.

03:19:51.620 --> 03:19:52.620
That means a lot.

03:19:52.620 --> 03:19:57.620
And I would reiterate that part of the success of this program is the people behind it.

03:19:57.620 --> 03:19:59.620
And you guys do a terrific job.

03:19:59.620 --> 03:20:05.620
And it means a lot not only to us up here, but to all the families in Worcester County that you serve.

03:20:06.620 --> 03:20:09.620
So thank you so much.

03:20:09.620 --> 03:20:12.620
And again, if no more questions, this is an approval item.

03:20:12.620 --> 03:20:19.620
So Mr. Taylor is requesting the approval of the 2324 Special Education Staffing Plan as presented.

03:20:19.620 --> 03:20:20.620
Thank you, Ms. Schwartz.

03:20:20.620 --> 03:20:25.620
Can I have a motion to approve the 2023-2024 Special Education Staffing Plan as presented?

03:20:25.620 --> 03:20:26.620
So moved.

03:20:26.620 --> 03:20:29.620
A motion by Ms. McComas, a second by Mr. Smack.

03:20:29.620 --> 03:20:30.620
All in favor?

03:20:30.620 --> 03:20:31.620
Aye.

03:20:31.620 --> 03:20:32.620
Thank you very much.

03:20:32.620 --> 03:20:33.620
Thank you, Ms. Phillips.

03:20:36.620 --> 03:20:39.620
I'll turn it back over to Ms. Schwartz for an update on the blueprint.

03:20:39.620 --> 03:20:40.620
Thank you.

03:20:40.620 --> 03:20:44.620
Rather than keeping my back to you, I thought I would do my report from up here.

03:20:44.620 --> 03:20:52.620
So as you know, we've heard a little bit about the blueprint today, but we're still moving down the path of our blueprint and getting to know it.

03:20:52.620 --> 03:21:03.620
As of July 27th, we did receive approval from the AIB, which is the Accountability Information Board, and we were very happy to hear that.

03:21:03.620 --> 03:21:15.620
Out of 24 systems, 18 of them received approval, and that means that our 24 blueprint monies are released when you receive approval, so that's positive.

03:21:15.620 --> 03:21:25.620
There were two counties that were pulled out that they had members of the AIB that were part of that county, so they abstained, but later were approved.

03:21:25.620 --> 03:21:29.620
So it ended up being 20 systems were approved total.

03:21:29.620 --> 03:21:31.620
Four were not.

03:21:31.620 --> 03:21:43.620
Three of the four that were not, Calvert, Garrett, and Charles County, had issues still with MOUs that they developed around career counselors and the CTE program.

03:21:43.620 --> 03:21:48.620
So their monies are going to be withheld until their MOUs are determined.

03:21:48.620 --> 03:21:57.620
So anything in the blueprint plan can hold up your plan from being approved if you're not right on track with the law, because we know that the blueprint now is law.

03:21:57.620 --> 03:22:11.620
Queen Anne's County had a different issue with their plan, and if you're following along, question 53 deals with by 2024, actually by the end of June 2024,

03:22:12.620 --> 03:22:15.620
we had to have a 10% increase in our salaries.

03:22:15.620 --> 03:22:25.620
Worcester County did receive that 10% barely with what our increase was this year, so we were approved.

03:22:25.620 --> 03:22:38.620
Queen Anne's County still, they think they're going to get there, but have not confirmed it yet, and so their monies are being withheld until they can confirm that they're going to reach the 10%.

03:22:38.620 --> 03:22:42.620
Again, we had to grow 1%, and we did make that.

03:22:42.620 --> 03:22:45.620
So we're starting all over again.

03:22:45.620 --> 03:22:49.620
As at August 23rd, they're going to release a new plan.

03:22:49.620 --> 03:22:51.620
This plan will be much meatier.

03:22:51.620 --> 03:22:59.620
Our first plan just really dealt with what we're doing and some goals that we wanted to set in Worcester County.

03:22:59.620 --> 03:23:02.620
We were able to set our own goals for the most part.

03:23:02.620 --> 03:23:17.620
Starting in August 23rd, when they release the new plan, there will be milestones, data points, objectives that the AIB and MSDE are going to agree upon that we have to reach at certain points throughout this process.

03:23:17.620 --> 03:23:26.620
So the stakes will increase because, again, reaching those goals will also mean part of having our 25 money released.

03:23:26.620 --> 03:23:40.620
So we are moving down that path, and as soon as the August 23rd blueprint implementation plan is released, I'll be happy to share more of that, probably at our September meeting.

03:23:40.620 --> 03:23:43.620
But if you ever have any questions, reach out to me.

03:23:43.620 --> 03:23:49.620
The new plan is updated with draft off of it on our website, so you're always welcome to look at that.

03:23:49.620 --> 03:23:56.620
But again, we had minimal, minimal adjustments through both of our review processes with MSDE and AIB.

03:23:56.620 --> 03:23:58.620
So we are in good shape.

03:23:58.620 --> 03:24:04.620
The next plan will be due in March 2024, so we'll start the cycle all over again.

03:24:04.620 --> 03:24:07.620
Any questions around the blueprint?

03:24:07.620 --> 03:24:10.620
Before I turn to any questions, I know the superintendent has to make a comment.

03:24:10.620 --> 03:24:13.620
Just a couple clarifying comments.

03:24:13.620 --> 03:24:18.620
We made that salary range this year by giving a percent.

03:24:18.620 --> 03:24:22.620
If we were not able to do that, we wouldn't have made that salary.

03:24:22.620 --> 03:24:24.620
So I want to thank the association.

03:24:24.620 --> 03:24:27.620
You'll hear more about that later today.

03:24:27.620 --> 03:24:39.620
Also, I don't know if, I think the board knows or our community, this plan is not just something they get in office and after about four or five hours, they're done.

03:24:39.620 --> 03:24:46.620
This has been long, extensive nights, and I want to thank many people in this room.

03:24:46.620 --> 03:24:50.620
In particular, I want to thank Ms. Schwartz, who is the blueprint coordinator.

03:24:50.620 --> 03:24:57.620
Most counties hired a separate person to do the blueprint coordinator job.

03:24:57.620 --> 03:24:59.620
We did not do that.

03:24:59.620 --> 03:25:04.620
Sorry, Dee, but Dee got assigned by the superintendent as a part of her job.

03:25:04.620 --> 03:25:09.620
And so Worcester County, again, found a way around without hiring someone.

03:25:09.620 --> 03:25:11.620
And I want to thank Dee for her leadership there.

03:25:11.620 --> 03:25:20.620
I also want to thank, most of them are in the room, our pillar coordinators, our leads for the work they've done because there's five pillars to that process.

03:25:20.620 --> 03:25:22.620
And again, extensive work.

03:25:22.620 --> 03:25:30.620
And as I look around the room, there are many in here or some in here anyway who served on those committees,

03:25:30.620 --> 03:25:35.620
either an overarching committee or individual lead committees.

03:25:35.620 --> 03:25:39.620
And again, just a lot of work.

03:25:39.620 --> 03:25:41.620
This isn't something what Dee's reporting out on.

03:25:41.620 --> 03:25:43.620
That is something we got in the room.

03:25:43.620 --> 03:25:44.620
Let's figure it out.

03:25:44.620 --> 03:25:50.620
I can't tell you the number of hours that these people have put in beyond what they have to do to make this thing work.

03:25:50.620 --> 03:25:54.620
And I know some of our staff sitting in here are shaking their head because they were a part of it.

03:25:54.620 --> 03:25:59.620
So I want to our community to know, I want our board to know, extensive work is going into this.

03:25:59.620 --> 03:26:11.620
And we were highlighted, again, Worcester County was highlighted for the exceptional work we did on our plan when all 24 counties were on the line and talking about it.

03:26:11.620 --> 03:26:13.620
So Ms. Schwartz, thank you.

03:26:13.620 --> 03:26:20.620
And all of you who served in lead positions and in committee positions, thank you for making this happen.

03:26:20.620 --> 03:26:28.620
And as your superintendent, I can't tell you how much I appreciate the many, many hours beyond that you've put in to make, again,

03:26:28.620 --> 03:26:32.620
Worcester County to be the shining star here in the state of Maryland.

03:26:32.620 --> 03:26:33.620
So thank you.

03:26:33.620 --> 03:26:34.620
Thank you.

03:26:34.620 --> 03:26:35.620
Any other board members?

03:26:35.620 --> 03:26:37.620
Any other comments?

03:26:37.620 --> 03:26:39.620
Ms. Schwartz, Ms. Schwartz, thanks again.

03:26:39.620 --> 03:26:41.620
You've done a terrific job for us and we appreciate it.

03:26:41.620 --> 03:26:42.620
Thank you.

03:26:42.620 --> 03:26:44.620
And that concludes curriculum instruction.

03:26:44.620 --> 03:26:45.620
So back to you.

03:26:45.620 --> 03:26:46.620
Thank you, sir.

03:26:46.620 --> 03:26:47.620
Thank you so much.

03:26:47.620 --> 03:26:54.620
Before I get on to administrative operations and Dr. App, we're going to take a brief five, getting some looks from my board members.

03:26:54.620 --> 03:26:58.620
We're going to take a brief five to ten minute recess and we'll be right back.

03:26:58.620 --> 03:26:59.620
Thank you so much.

03:27:24.620 --> 03:27:25.620
Thank you.

03:27:54.620 --> 03:27:55.620
Thank you.

03:28:24.620 --> 03:28:25.620
Thank you.

03:28:54.620 --> 03:28:55.620
Thank you.

03:29:24.620 --> 03:29:25.620
Thank you.

03:29:54.620 --> 03:29:55.620
Thank you.

03:30:24.620 --> 03:30:25.620
Thank you.

03:30:54.620 --> 03:30:55.620
Thank you.

03:31:24.620 --> 03:31:25.620
Thank you.

03:31:54.620 --> 03:31:55.620
Thank you.

03:32:24.620 --> 03:32:25.620
Thank you.

03:32:54.620 --> 03:32:55.620
Thank you.

03:33:24.620 --> 03:33:25.620
Thank you.

03:33:54.620 --> 03:33:55.620
Thank you.

03:34:24.620 --> 03:34:25.620
Thank you.

03:34:54.620 --> 03:34:55.620
Thank you.

03:35:24.620 --> 03:35:25.620
Thank you.

03:35:54.620 --> 03:35:55.620
Thank you.

03:36:24.620 --> 03:36:25.620
Thank you.

03:36:54.620 --> 03:36:55.620
Thank you.

03:37:24.620 --> 03:37:25.620
Thank you.

03:37:54.620 --> 03:37:55.620
Thank you.

03:38:24.620 --> 03:38:25.620
Thank you.

03:38:54.620 --> 03:39:12.260
We'll get started here in another maybe minute if everybody can resume their seats.

03:39:12.260 --> 03:39:13.260
Thank you.

03:39:13.260 --> 03:39:14.260
Okay.

03:39:14.260 --> 03:39:19.100
And now for administrative operations, I'm going to turn it over to Dr. App.

03:39:19.100 --> 03:39:20.100
Dr. App?

03:39:20.100 --> 03:39:21.100

The superintendent recommends approval of the personal exhibit as presented.

03:42:56.380 --> 03:43:01.100
Can I have a motion to approve the personnel exhibit as presented?

03:43:01.100 --> 03:43:03.100
So moved, Bill Buchanan.

03:43:03.100 --> 03:43:05.100
Motion by Mr. Buchanan.

03:43:05.100 --> 03:43:07.100
Second.

03:43:07.100 --> 03:43:09.100
Second by Ms. McComas.

03:43:09.100 --> 03:43:11.100
All in favor?

03:43:11.100 --> 03:43:13.100
Aye.

03:43:13.100 --> 03:43:15.100
Any opposed?

03:43:15.100 --> 03:43:17.100
Thank you, Dr. App, and we'll continue with you.

03:43:17.100 --> 03:43:19.100
Thank you.

03:43:19.100 --> 03:43:21.100
Our next item, we have the ratification of the negotiated agreements.

03:43:21.100 --> 03:43:23.100
The agreement was signed in June and last week of August.

03:43:23.100 --> 03:43:29.100
The Worcester County Teachers Association and the Worcester County Educational Support

03:43:29.100 --> 03:43:35.100
Personnel Association have ratified revised agreements, which will provide the following.

03:43:35.100 --> 03:43:43.100
For the Worcester County Teachers Association, salary adjustments, a step increase in longevity

03:43:43.100 --> 03:43:49.100
for eligible employees, a 1.14% cost of living adjustment.

03:43:49.100 --> 03:43:59.100
That broken out, 0.75% was effective last April, 0.39% will be effective July 1st and

03:43:59.100 --> 03:44:01.100
paid retroactively.

03:44:01.100 --> 03:44:07.100
Longevity pay increased by $100, and we have a memorandum of understanding for eligible

03:44:07.100 --> 03:44:09.100
employees to receive a one-time bonus.

03:44:09.100 --> 03:44:15.100
The bonus is funded by amending the Essar and Maryland Leeds grant funds for that purpose.

03:44:15.100 --> 03:44:21.100
For the support group, salary adjustments, a step increase in longevity for eligible

03:44:21.100 --> 03:44:25.100
employees, a 1.64% cost of living adjustment.

03:44:25.100 --> 03:44:31.100
0.75% of that was effective April 2023.

03:44:31.100 --> 03:44:39.100
The remaining 0.89% will be effective July 1, retropaid back to July 1.

03:44:39.100 --> 03:44:41.100
Longevity pay will be increased by $100.

03:44:42.100 --> 03:44:48.100
We also have a memorandum of agreement with the support group for a one-time bonus, and

03:44:48.100 --> 03:44:55.100
that bonus is also being funded out with the amended Essar and Maryland Leeds grant funding.

03:44:55.100 --> 03:45:03.100
At this time, the signing of these signature pages will mark the ratification of the new

03:45:03.100 --> 03:45:07.100
contracts, and the superintendent recommends your approval for the revised negotiated

03:45:07.100 --> 03:45:08.100
contracts.

03:45:08.100 --> 03:45:14.100
If the board does approve this, we have signature pages that we would sign now, and we have

03:45:14.100 --> 03:45:18.100
the president of the teachers' association here to sign as well.

03:45:18.100 --> 03:45:19.100
Okay.

03:45:19.100 --> 03:45:24.100
Can I have a motion and a second to approve the revised negotiated agreements, the WCTA,

03:45:24.100 --> 03:45:29.100
the WCESPA, as negotiated, as presented?

03:45:29.100 --> 03:45:30.100
So moved.

03:45:30.100 --> 03:45:31.100
Motion by Mr. Gordy.

03:45:31.100 --> 03:45:32.100
Second.

03:45:32.100 --> 03:45:33.100
A second by Mr. Smack.

03:45:33.100 --> 03:45:34.100
I have a question.

03:45:34.100 --> 03:45:35.100
Yes.

03:45:35.100 --> 03:45:41.100
Do you know how many teachers voted for the ratification or how many teachers voted within

03:45:41.100 --> 03:45:44.100
that parameter of voting yes and no?

03:45:44.100 --> 03:45:46.100
I do not have that number.

03:45:46.100 --> 03:45:47.100
Okay.

03:45:47.100 --> 03:45:58.100
Were the, was the WCTA able to hear the concerns of the teachers who voted no for that?

03:45:58.100 --> 03:45:59.100
Yes.

03:45:59.100 --> 03:46:02.100
That is something that the teachers' association, that doesn't come through our office.

03:46:02.100 --> 03:46:03.100
Okay.

03:46:03.100 --> 03:46:07.100
However, I did hear from Mr. Ivory Smith, and he shared with me yesterday, I haven't

03:46:07.100 --> 03:46:14.100
spoken with Beth about the numbers, the support ratification was, as of yesterday, 44 in favor,

03:46:14.100 --> 03:46:15.100
1 against.

03:46:15.100 --> 03:46:16.100
For the support staff?

03:46:16.100 --> 03:46:17.100
Yes.

03:46:17.100 --> 03:46:18.100
Okay.

03:46:18.100 --> 03:46:24.100
While I'm happy to see that the ESSER funds were used to make up a portion of what was

03:46:24.100 --> 03:46:30.100
promised to the staff, I am in agreement with some of the personnel that I've spoken to

03:46:30.100 --> 03:46:35.100
who feel ESSER funds are not negotiated and were always assigned to the county by the

03:46:35.100 --> 03:46:41.100
state, meaning that the Board of Education really didn't sacrifice anything in this negotiation

03:46:41.100 --> 03:46:42.100
process.

03:46:42.100 --> 03:46:50.100
I do still feel that there are unnecessary spending cuts that could be made for our teachers

03:46:50.100 --> 03:46:52.100
and support staff to make them whole.

03:46:52.100 --> 03:46:53.100
Okay.

03:46:53.100 --> 03:46:55.100
I have a motion and a second.

03:46:55.100 --> 03:46:56.100
All in favor?

03:46:56.100 --> 03:46:57.100
Aye.

03:46:57.100 --> 03:46:58.100
Aye.

03:46:58.100 --> 03:46:59.100
Any opposed?

03:46:59.100 --> 03:47:00.100
Okay.

03:47:00.100 --> 03:47:03.100
One opposed, let the record show Ms. Addis was opposed.

03:47:03.100 --> 03:47:04.100
The motion carries.

03:47:04.100 --> 03:47:07.100
We will now sign the agreement.

03:47:59.100 --> 03:48:10.100
Okay.

03:48:10.100 --> 03:48:38.100
Thank you.

03:48:38.100 --> 03:49:05.100
Thank you.

03:49:08.100 --> 03:49:36.100
Thank you.

03:49:37.100 --> 03:49:38.100
Thank you.

03:49:38.100 --> 03:49:39.100
Thank you.

03:49:39.100 --> 03:49:40.100
Thank you.

03:49:40.100 --> 03:49:41.100
Thank you, Beth, for your hard work.

03:49:41.100 --> 03:49:42.100
Thank you.

03:49:42.100 --> 03:49:43.100
Thank you, Beth.

03:49:43.100 --> 03:49:44.100
Thank you.

03:49:44.100 --> 03:49:45.100
Thank you, Dr. App.

03:49:45.100 --> 03:49:58.100
I'll turn it back over to you for school bus 7.3.

03:49:58.100 --> 03:49:59.100
Thank you, Ms. Ferrante.

03:50:00.100 --> 03:50:06.100
I'd like to invite Ms. Kim Heiser, our manager of transportation, up to address the board

03:50:06.100 --> 03:50:12.100
for the purchase of a new school bus, and then after that she'll be asking you to replace

03:50:12.100 --> 03:50:13.100
a bus contractor.

03:50:13.100 --> 03:50:14.100
Good afternoon, everyone.

03:50:14.100 --> 03:50:21.100
As Dr. App said, I do have two things to present to you today.

03:50:21.100 --> 03:50:26.100
The first exhibit is to request permission to purchase a new or used replacement school

03:50:26.100 --> 03:50:27.100
bus.

03:50:27.100 --> 03:50:31.100
Mr. Dean Ennis, who is a contractor in the Pocomoke area, he currently has a regular

03:50:31.100 --> 03:50:33.100
run bus and a spare bus.

03:50:33.100 --> 03:50:37.100
His spare bus is starting its 14th of its 15th year.

03:50:37.100 --> 03:50:42.100
And it's important to note Mr. Ennis puts a lot of miles on buses because he's one

03:50:42.100 --> 03:50:47.100
of the athletic bus providers, and so he travels a lot putting a lot of miles on his bus, not

03:50:47.100 --> 03:50:51.100
just coming home, home to school, school to home, but for other field trips and events

03:50:51.100 --> 03:50:52.100
as well.

03:50:52.100 --> 03:50:58.100
He is requesting permission to purchase a new bus, not to be put in place this school

03:50:58.100 --> 03:51:01.100
year, but for the coming school year, 24, 25.

03:51:01.100 --> 03:51:08.100
It is currently about a year to build and order a bus, and so for production timeline,

03:51:08.100 --> 03:51:14.100
he's requesting permission to order a bus for the fall and have it for the following

03:51:14.100 --> 03:51:16.100
school year.

03:51:17.100 --> 03:51:23.100
So it is the recommendation of the superintendent to approve the exhibit as presented.

03:51:23.100 --> 03:51:29.100
Can I have a motion to approve the purchase of the new school bus exhibit as presented?

03:51:29.100 --> 03:51:30.100
So moved.

03:51:30.100 --> 03:51:32.100
Okay, motion by Ms. McComas.

03:51:32.100 --> 03:51:33.100
Do I have a second?

03:51:33.100 --> 03:51:34.100
Second.

03:51:34.100 --> 03:51:35.100
A second by Ms. Hattis.

03:51:35.100 --> 03:51:36.100
All in favor?

03:51:36.100 --> 03:51:37.100
Aye.

03:51:37.100 --> 03:51:38.100
Any opposed?

03:51:38.100 --> 03:51:39.100
Thank you, Ms. Hager.

03:51:39.100 --> 03:51:40.100
You can go forward.

03:51:40.100 --> 03:51:47.100
For the second exhibit, we had a contractor notify me the third week of July that she

03:51:47.100 --> 03:51:51.100
was going to be giving up her contract and moving out of state.

03:51:51.100 --> 03:51:56.100
Ms. Kim Moore, who provides transportation services for Stephen Cater Middle, BIS, and

03:51:56.100 --> 03:52:00.100
Buckingham Elementary School is giving up her contract.

03:52:00.100 --> 03:52:06.100
With that, we notified all available folks who were interested, and we had a selection

03:52:06.100 --> 03:52:11.100
process that involved a school administrator, myself, and the school vehicle driver instructor,

03:52:11.100 --> 03:52:19.100
and we have selected Ms. Laura Lewis to replace Ms. Kim Moore as a bus contractor on the northern

03:52:19.100 --> 03:52:25.100
part of the county effective for the 23, 24 school year.

03:52:25.100 --> 03:52:30.100
It is the recommendation of the superintendent to approve this exhibit as presented.

03:52:30.100 --> 03:52:31.100
Thank you, Ms. Hager.

03:52:31.100 --> 03:52:32.100
Thank you, Ms. Hager.

03:52:32.100 --> 03:52:35.100
Can I have a motion to approve the replacement bus contractor exhibit as presented?

03:52:35.100 --> 03:52:37.100
Motion, Donald Smack.

03:52:37.100 --> 03:52:39.100
Motion by Mr. Smack.

03:52:39.100 --> 03:52:40.100
Second.

03:52:40.100 --> 03:52:41.100
A second by Mr. Gordy.

03:52:41.100 --> 03:52:42.100
All in favor?

03:52:42.100 --> 03:52:43.100
Aye.

03:52:43.100 --> 03:52:44.100
Any opposed?

03:52:44.100 --> 03:52:45.100
Thank you, Ms. Hager.

03:52:45.100 --> 03:52:50.100
I will note that with all that unfolding, I've asked permission for Mr. Ennis to purchase

03:52:50.100 --> 03:52:55.100
a new bus, but he's decided to purchase Ms. Moore's bus that is only three years old

03:52:55.100 --> 03:53:00.100
because the contractor coming on does not need the bus that Ms. Moore had for sale,

03:53:00.100 --> 03:53:03.100
so with all that said, that bus will not be sitting.

03:53:03.100 --> 03:53:05.100
He is purchasing Ms. Moore's bus.

03:53:05.100 --> 03:53:07.100
Thank you.

03:53:07.100 --> 03:53:08.100
Thank you.

03:53:08.100 --> 03:53:11.100
Mr. Ferrante, I'd just like to thank Kim for all the work she's doing.

03:53:11.100 --> 03:53:18.100
Also, I see Mike and Nancy Donoway in the back, and I want to thank them for working with

03:53:18.100 --> 03:53:23.100
us as the school bus contractor association.

03:53:23.100 --> 03:53:24.100
We are meet and confer team.

03:53:24.100 --> 03:53:29.100
They are two members of that team, and we had a great collaboration this year, and we

03:53:29.100 --> 03:53:34.100
came to an agreement with the bus drivers as well, and they're going to be also receiving

03:53:34.100 --> 03:53:37.100
a bonus as well, so we thank them.

03:53:37.100 --> 03:53:38.100
Thank you very much.

03:53:38.100 --> 03:53:39.100
We appreciate it.

03:53:39.100 --> 03:53:40.100
Thanks again, Kim.

03:53:40.100 --> 03:53:43.100
Thank you.

03:53:43.100 --> 03:53:48.100
And now I'm going to turn it over for the memorandum of understanding between the WCPS

03:53:48.100 --> 03:53:52.100
and the Worcester County Sheriff's Office to Dr. Annette Wallace, our safety officer.

03:53:52.100 --> 03:53:53.100
Thank you.

03:53:53.100 --> 03:53:54.100
Good afternoon.

03:53:54.100 --> 03:53:59.100
Again, in your board exhibit, you will see a memorandum of understanding between Worcester

03:53:59.100 --> 03:54:02.100
County Public Schools and the Sheriff's Office.

03:54:02.100 --> 03:54:06.100
We have had a memorandum of understanding with them since we've had school resource

03:54:06.100 --> 03:54:08.100
deputies in our schools.

03:54:08.100 --> 03:54:15.100
We collaboratively noted that we needed to firm up some things and make our memorandum

03:54:15.100 --> 03:54:17.100
of understanding a little bit stronger.

03:54:18.100 --> 03:54:23.100
So over the past few months and specifically the last few weeks, we worked together on

03:54:23.100 --> 03:54:27.100
a memorandum of understanding that we can both feel comfortable with.

03:54:27.100 --> 03:54:32.100
And so before you is that memorandum of understanding, and the superintendent would request your

03:54:32.100 --> 03:54:40.100
approval of the memorandum of understanding, and subsequently, should you choose to approve,

03:54:40.100 --> 03:54:43.100
we will at a later date have Mr. Ferrante signature.

03:54:43.100 --> 03:54:45.100
We do have one edit to make on the document.

03:54:45.100 --> 03:54:49.100
So we will have Mr. Taylor's signature and Mr. Ferrante's signature at a later date on

03:54:49.100 --> 03:54:50.100
that document.

03:54:50.100 --> 03:54:51.100
Thank you, Dr. Wallace.

03:54:51.100 --> 03:54:55.100
Any questions for Dr. Wallace regarding that memorandum of understanding?

03:54:55.100 --> 03:54:59.100
Can I have a motion to approve the memorandum of understanding between the WCPS and the

03:54:59.100 --> 03:55:03.100
Worcester County Sheriff's Office, and a second?

03:55:03.100 --> 03:55:04.100
Motion.

03:55:04.100 --> 03:55:05.100
A motion by Mr. Smack.

03:55:05.100 --> 03:55:06.100
Second.

03:55:06.100 --> 03:55:07.100
A second by Mrs. Addis.

03:55:07.100 --> 03:55:09.100
Any discussion?

03:55:09.100 --> 03:55:10.100
All in favor?

03:55:10.100 --> 03:55:11.100
Aye.

03:55:11.100 --> 03:55:12.100
Any opposed?

03:55:12.100 --> 03:55:13.100
Thank you so much.

03:55:13.100 --> 03:55:14.100
Thank you.

03:55:14.100 --> 03:55:18.100
I would like to publicly thank Sheriff Matt Crisafoli, as well as his Chief Deputy Nate

03:55:18.100 --> 03:55:21.100
Passwater, and also his staff who worked.

03:55:21.100 --> 03:55:26.100
And my staff, Mr. Sean Goddard, who's in the back, who spent a lot of time working on this

03:55:26.100 --> 03:55:27.100
document.

03:55:27.100 --> 03:55:29.100
So we appreciate their partnership and collaboration.

03:55:29.100 --> 03:55:32.100
Next is a safety update, and it's going to be brief this month.

03:55:32.100 --> 03:55:39.100
We have set up our next district-wide safety meeting for September 12th at 5.30, and those

03:55:39.100 --> 03:55:44.100
in the community and within our school community who are a part of that will be getting an

03:55:44.100 --> 03:55:49.100
invitation in the next day or so for that follow-up safety meeting where our communication

03:55:49.100 --> 03:55:55.100
team will provide updates, as well as our weapons detection subcommittee will be providing

03:55:55.100 --> 03:55:56.100
updates.

03:55:56.100 --> 03:55:57.100
So that is coming up.

03:55:57.100 --> 03:56:03.100
Our school safety plans are being resubmitted as we have moved to, and I love you guys,

03:56:03.100 --> 03:56:08.100
reunification protocol, as well as a standard response using that program.

03:56:08.100 --> 03:56:11.100
I know several of our board members attended some of our safety conference where those

03:56:11.100 --> 03:56:16.100
things were discussed, but our schools are actively working on updating their safety

03:56:16.100 --> 03:56:18.100
plans to make sure all the new protocols are there.

03:56:18.100 --> 03:56:19.100
Any questions?

03:56:19.100 --> 03:56:21.100
Any questions for Dr. Wallace?

03:56:21.100 --> 03:56:22.100
Okay.

03:56:22.100 --> 03:56:23.100
Thank you so much.

03:56:23.100 --> 03:56:28.100
So now I'm going to ask Mrs. Sears to come up for a school system calendar revision.

03:56:28.100 --> 03:56:29.100
Carrie, welcome.

03:56:29.100 --> 03:56:32.100
If you'll speak into the mic for us, please, thank you.

03:56:32.100 --> 03:56:33.100
Will do.

03:56:33.100 --> 03:56:35.100
Good afternoon, everyone.

03:56:36.100 --> 03:56:41.100
I actually have a very quick calendar revision, and hopefully the only one we'll have this

03:56:41.100 --> 03:56:42.100
year.

03:56:42.100 --> 03:56:47.100
So following last month's board meeting, we were notified by the Worcester County Board

03:56:47.100 --> 03:56:52.100
of Elections that the presidential primary date was different from what we had originally

03:56:52.100 --> 03:56:55.100
taught, what we were originally told.

03:56:55.100 --> 03:57:00.100
That decision was made at the state level, but basically we are coming to you to propose

03:57:00.100 --> 03:57:04.100
a change to our countywide professional development day, which is traditionally held on our

03:57:04.100 --> 03:57:05.100
election days.

03:57:05.100 --> 03:57:10.100
That way our schools that are polling places, learning is not disrupted at that time.

03:57:10.100 --> 03:57:16.100
So the superintendent is recommending a change in our calendar to move the countywide

03:57:16.100 --> 03:57:24.100
professional development day from April 23rd, 2024, to Tuesday, May 14th, 2024.

03:57:24.100 --> 03:57:25.100
Okay.

03:57:25.100 --> 03:57:29.100
Anybody have any questions for Mrs. Sears about that movement and that date?

03:57:29.100 --> 03:57:33.100
If none, I'd like to ask for a motion to approve that.

03:57:33.100 --> 03:57:39.100
To approve that change to our calendar from May 14th, actually from April 23rd to May

03:57:39.100 --> 03:57:40.100
14th, 2024.

03:57:40.100 --> 03:57:43.100
Do I have a motion and a second?

03:57:43.100 --> 03:57:45.100
So moved, Bill Buchanan.

03:57:45.100 --> 03:57:46.100
Motion by Mr. Buchanan.

03:57:46.100 --> 03:57:47.100
Do I have a second?

03:57:47.100 --> 03:57:48.100
Second.

03:57:48.100 --> 03:57:49.100
A second by Mrs. McComas.

03:57:49.100 --> 03:57:50.100
All in favor?

03:57:50.100 --> 03:57:51.100
Aye.

03:57:51.100 --> 03:57:52.100
Thank you so much.

03:57:52.100 --> 03:57:53.100
Thank you so much.

03:57:53.100 --> 03:57:55.100
And just so you're aware, we're going to be publicizing this out to our community to

03:57:55.100 --> 03:57:57.100
make sure everyone's aware of that change as well.

03:57:57.100 --> 03:57:58.100
Perfect.

03:57:58.100 --> 03:57:59.100
Thank you again.

03:58:00.100 --> 03:58:03.100
Yes, go ahead.

03:58:03.100 --> 03:58:06.100
For high school principal, I know there's a high school principal in the room, and if

03:58:06.100 --> 03:58:11.100
we have high school community who's listening, that is an AP testing day for board members

03:58:11.100 --> 03:58:15.100
who are former school people who know that testing calendar.

03:58:15.100 --> 03:58:17.100
So that is an AP testing day.

03:58:17.100 --> 03:58:20.100
I've already had conversations with all of our high school principals.

03:58:20.100 --> 03:58:22.100
We will continue to do AP testing that day.

03:58:22.100 --> 03:58:26.100
Our teachers are going to be there anyway for professional development, but as you may

03:58:26.100 --> 03:58:32.100
know or remember or may not know, an AP teacher can't be the one who gives the AP exam.

03:58:32.100 --> 03:58:37.100
So we'll have teachers or proctors in the building that day, and our students will continue on

03:58:37.100 --> 03:58:39.100
a regular calendar taking the AP assessment.

03:58:39.100 --> 03:58:41.100
So that's all.

03:58:41.100 --> 03:58:43.100
Thank you for that, Dr. Wallace.

03:58:43.100 --> 03:58:47.100
I assure all of you that there will be no transportation issues.

03:58:47.100 --> 03:58:53.100
Most of our kids at that level get to school, but if there is a problem, if anybody would

03:58:53.100 --> 03:58:57.100
ask you, we will make sure they get transportation to the schools.

03:58:57.100 --> 03:58:58.100
Thank you.

03:58:58.100 --> 03:59:01.100
And now I'll turn it over to Mr. Tolbert for physical operations.

03:59:01.100 --> 03:59:03.100
Yes, thank you, Mr. Fronte.

03:59:03.100 --> 03:59:05.100
The first item is our annual budgetary transfers.

03:59:05.100 --> 03:59:10.100
I'll walk the board through the transfers and take any questions that you may have.

03:59:10.100 --> 03:59:14.100
Each year at the August meeting, the board is asked to approve budgetary transfers from

03:59:14.100 --> 03:59:16.100
the prior fiscal year.

03:59:16.100 --> 03:59:19.100
These budgetary transfers are part of our year in process and are required to amend

03:59:19.100 --> 03:59:22.100
our final prior year budget to align with our actual expenditures.

03:59:22.100 --> 03:59:26.100
As the board is aware, there are two types of budgetary transfers.

03:59:26.100 --> 03:59:29.100
There's inter-category and intra-category.

03:59:29.100 --> 03:59:34.100
Inter-category are those transfers between budget categories, and intra-category are

03:59:34.100 --> 03:59:36.100
those transfers within the category.

03:59:36.100 --> 03:59:42.100
In FY23, we had five categories where actual expenditures exceeded the original budget.

03:59:42.100 --> 03:59:45.100
To properly account for this variance, the following transfers are being submitted to

03:59:45.100 --> 03:59:48.100
the Board of Education for their approval.

03:59:48.100 --> 03:59:53.100
We were requesting a transfer from the category of instructional salaries, $990,000,

03:59:53.100 --> 03:59:58.100
and from the category of fixed charges, $516,780.

03:59:58.100 --> 04:00:03.100
Also, as the board is aware, in FY23, the board voted to do a refresh of our current

04:00:03.100 --> 04:00:05.100
student and staff devices.

04:00:05.100 --> 04:00:10.100
This refresh involved the sale of our current iPads to a third party.

04:00:10.100 --> 04:00:14.100
The proceeds from the sale were used to fund the final payment on the original Apple lease

04:00:14.100 --> 04:00:17.100
and the first payment on the new lease.

04:00:17.100 --> 04:00:24.100
We were requesting the board to approve an increase in FY23 budget revenues of $1,348,387

04:00:24.100 --> 04:00:29.100
to reflect the additional revenue from the sale and also to increase the FY23 expenditure

04:00:29.100 --> 04:00:32.100
level by the same amount.

04:00:32.100 --> 04:00:38.100
Under the category of instructional support, we were requesting the transfer in $71,000.

04:00:38.100 --> 04:00:43.100
This transfer to this category is largely tied to the expense of holding our commencement

04:00:43.100 --> 04:00:47.100
ceremonies outside in our stadiums last year.

04:00:47.100 --> 04:00:51.100
Under the category of textbooks and classroom supplies, we were requesting the transfer

04:00:51.100 --> 04:00:56.100
of $1,348,387.

04:00:56.100 --> 04:01:01.100
This transfer is a result of the refresh of our student and staff iPads last year.

04:01:01.100 --> 04:01:06.100
Due to the favorable market for our iPads, we were able to sell those devices and utilize

04:01:06.100 --> 04:01:10.100
the proceeds to fund the year four payment of the original lease and the year one payment

04:01:10.100 --> 04:01:12.100
of the new Apple lease.

04:01:12.100 --> 04:01:16.100
The transfer in this category is funded from the sale of the used iPads.

04:01:16.100 --> 04:01:22.100
Under the area of student transportation, we were requesting the transfer in $492,000.

04:01:22.100 --> 04:01:26.100
This transfer to this category is a result of higher than planned expenditures in the

04:01:26.100 --> 04:01:31.100
areas of the fuel supplement paid to our bus contractors due to rising fuel prices, additional

04:01:31.100 --> 04:01:37.100
time paid to our bus contractors to clean their buses due to COVID protocols, transportation

04:01:37.100 --> 04:01:42.100
of our FIT students, and after school transportation.

04:01:42.100 --> 04:01:47.100
Under operation of plant, we were requesting the transfer in $621,000.

04:01:47.100 --> 04:01:52.100
This transfer is necessary due to rising utility costs and the increasing cost of custodial

04:01:52.100 --> 04:01:54.100
and other supplies.

04:01:54.100 --> 04:01:59.100
Under maintenance of plant, we were requesting the transfer in $322,680.

04:01:59.100 --> 04:02:04.100
This transfer is necessary to address the increasing cost of HVAC and other costs related

04:02:04.100 --> 04:02:09.100
to repairing and maintaining the systems in our buildings.

04:02:09.100 --> 04:02:14.100
Also, the board is requested to approve the FI-23 intra category budget transfers, and

04:02:14.100 --> 04:02:20.100
these transfers are within the category and are just in preparation for our year-end closeout.

04:02:20.100 --> 04:02:24.100
I'll take any questions that the board may have on the transfers request.

04:02:24.100 --> 04:02:31.100
Does anyone have any questions for Mr. Tolbert regarding intra or intra category transfers?

04:02:31.100 --> 04:02:33.100
Any board members?

04:02:33.100 --> 04:02:34.100
Okay.

04:02:34.100 --> 04:02:38.100
The superintendent recommends the approval of the budgetary transfers as presented.

04:02:38.100 --> 04:02:39.100
Thank you, Mr. Tolbert.

04:02:39.100 --> 04:02:44.100
Can I have a motion and a second to approve the FY-23 budgetary transfers as presented?

04:02:44.100 --> 04:02:45.100
So moved.

04:02:45.100 --> 04:02:47.100
Motion by Dr. Andes.

04:02:47.100 --> 04:02:48.100
Second.

04:02:48.100 --> 04:02:49.100
Second by Mr. Gordy.

04:02:49.100 --> 04:02:50.100
All in favor?

04:02:50.100 --> 04:02:51.100
Aye.

04:02:51.100 --> 04:02:52.100
Any opposed?

04:02:52.100 --> 04:02:53.100
Thank you, Mr. Tolbert.

04:02:53.100 --> 04:02:54.100
Thank you.

04:02:54.100 --> 04:02:59.100
And my last item, Mr. Fronte, is the monthly financial report for the month of July showing

04:02:59.100 --> 04:03:05.100
salary expenditures of $2,161,983.77.

04:03:05.100 --> 04:03:08.100
The superintendent recommends approval of the monthly financial report as presented.

04:03:08.100 --> 04:03:09.100
Thank you, Mr. Tolbert.

04:03:09.100 --> 04:03:14.100
Can I have a motion and a second to approve the July 31, 2023 monthly financial report

04:03:14.100 --> 04:03:15.100
as presented?

04:03:15.100 --> 04:03:16.100
Motion by Ms. Smack.

04:03:16.100 --> 04:03:17.100
Motion by Mr. Smack.

04:03:17.100 --> 04:03:18.100
Second.

04:03:18.100 --> 04:03:19.100
A second by Ms. McComas.

04:03:19.100 --> 04:03:20.100
All in favor?

04:03:20.100 --> 04:03:21.100
Aye.

04:03:21.100 --> 04:03:22.100
Any opposed?

04:03:22.100 --> 04:03:23.100
Thank you so much.

04:03:23.100 --> 04:03:24.100
Thank you very much.

04:03:24.100 --> 04:03:25.100
Back to you, Mr. Fronte.

04:03:25.100 --> 04:03:26.100
Thank you, Mr. Tolbert.

04:03:26.100 --> 04:03:27.100
Okay.

04:03:28.100 --> 04:03:29.100
Okay.

04:03:29.100 --> 04:03:32.100
And now I'd like to open up the floor to my fellow board members in the event that you

04:03:32.100 --> 04:03:34.100
have any comments for today.

04:03:36.100 --> 04:03:37.100
Satis?

04:03:38.100 --> 04:03:47.100
After having conversations with fellow board members this past month, I am going to make

04:03:47.100 --> 04:03:54.100
a motion to revisit and add one more night meeting in November to the fiscal year 23

04:03:54.100 --> 04:03:55.100
calendar.

04:03:56.100 --> 04:03:57.100
Okay.

04:03:57.100 --> 04:04:02.100
I have a motion on the floor by Ms. Satis to add another night meeting in November of

04:04:02.100 --> 04:04:04.100
this year, this calendar year.

04:04:04.100 --> 04:04:06.100
Do I have a second?

04:04:06.100 --> 04:04:07.100
Second by Ms. Smack.

04:04:07.100 --> 04:04:09.100
A second by Mr. Smack.

04:04:09.100 --> 04:04:11.100
Any discussion?

04:04:11.100 --> 04:04:12.100
All in favor?

04:04:12.100 --> 04:04:13.100
Aye.

04:04:13.100 --> 04:04:14.100
Any opposed?

04:04:14.100 --> 04:04:15.100
Thank you so much.

04:04:15.100 --> 04:04:19.100
I appreciate it and I know a lot of constituents in the area appreciate that as well.

04:04:20.100 --> 04:04:23.100
I guess I'm just going to give my board comments since I have the floor right now.

04:04:23.100 --> 04:04:24.100
Sure.

04:04:24.100 --> 04:04:28.100
But I just want to let everyone know this past month I was able to sit it on the first

04:04:28.100 --> 04:04:31.100
day of the safety summit that they have yearly.

04:04:31.100 --> 04:04:35.100
And this summit was one of the most informative sessions that I've ever sat through and I'm

04:04:35.100 --> 04:04:41.100
grateful to have been given the opportunity to see the skill and expertise that goes into

04:04:41.100 --> 04:04:45.100
the line of work of working with the sheriff's department in conjunction with the school

04:04:45.100 --> 04:04:46.100
system.

04:04:46.100 --> 04:04:50.100
The sheriff's office has many great men and women working every day to keep our schools

04:04:50.100 --> 04:04:54.100
safe and it truly showed in the presentations that were given.

04:04:54.100 --> 04:05:00.100
I was really blown away by that first day's presentation and training.

04:05:00.100 --> 04:05:05.100
With fiscal year 23 negotiations being racked up, the start of fiscal year 24 budget proposals

04:05:05.100 --> 04:05:07.100
are right around the corner.

04:05:07.100 --> 04:05:13.100
And I have many concerns that I've been working with Dr. Tolbert with, or Mr. Tolbert, I'm

04:05:13.100 --> 04:05:19.100
sorry, with getting all the information just so that I can get a better understanding of

04:05:19.100 --> 04:05:21.100
the budget in its entirety.

04:05:21.100 --> 04:05:25.100
Just so that we can all work together to make sure that our teachers, support staff, and

04:05:25.100 --> 04:05:30.100
bus contractors are whole and considering what is coming down to the pipeline with the

04:05:30.100 --> 04:05:32.100
blueprint.

04:05:32.100 --> 04:05:36.100
We need to start having discussions amongst the board and executive team to truly understand

04:05:36.100 --> 04:05:42.100
what the blueprint entails and I would like to start seeing scenarios for our budget to

04:05:42.100 --> 04:05:46.100
include a budgetary pay raise of the $60,000 starting salary.

04:05:46.100 --> 04:05:52.100
And then I'm also wondering how it works with the career ladder and if that's going to be

04:05:52.100 --> 04:05:56.100
created and if so, will this discussion be made available to the public and allow teacher

04:05:56.100 --> 04:05:58.100
input?

04:05:58.100 --> 04:06:04.100
We need to be working together now so that the 2026 budget year, the community isn't shocked

04:06:04.100 --> 04:06:09.100
when we are asking for close to a $32 million increase due to pay increases alone.

04:06:09.100 --> 04:06:15.100
So I'm looking forward to working proactively in fiscal year 24 for, instead of, you know,

04:06:15.100 --> 04:06:19.100
proactively instead of reactively.

04:06:19.100 --> 04:06:25.100
In regards to the public comments that were made earlier today, I'm just, I know you might not

04:06:25.100 --> 04:06:29.100
be able to answer today, but maybe we can have further discussions because I was reached out

04:06:29.100 --> 04:06:35.100
to them very late last week in regards to the process of the book review process.

04:06:35.100 --> 04:06:41.100
And I'm just interested if people are taxpayers, if they don't have children in schools but are

04:06:41.100 --> 04:06:47.100
still concerned about the materials that are in our public libraries, what the method is with

04:06:49.100 --> 04:06:51.100
going about doing that?

04:06:51.100 --> 04:06:55.100
And like I said, if you're able to answer today, that would be great and if not, then we can

04:06:55.100 --> 04:06:57.100
follow up.

04:06:57.100 --> 04:07:01.100
Dr. Wallace, before we go, I want to make sure I clarify something you said before that.

04:07:01.100 --> 04:07:05.100
Did you say $32 million?

04:07:05.100 --> 04:07:07.100
No.

04:07:07.100 --> 04:07:09.100
You said $32 million pay raise?

04:07:09.100 --> 04:07:15.100
For the entirety of all of the increases with getting to that $60,000 at least minimum and then

04:07:15.100 --> 04:07:17.100
whether or not that there is a career ladder.

04:07:17.100 --> 04:07:19.100
Okay.

04:07:19.100 --> 04:07:21.100
For the blueprint.

04:07:21.100 --> 04:07:23.100
I just want to make sure I understood.

04:07:23.100 --> 04:07:25.100
Thank you.

04:07:25.100 --> 04:07:27.100
Sure.

04:07:27.100 --> 04:07:33.100
I'll try to answer to the best of my ability what you asked and I'll let Ms. Schwartz certainly

04:07:33.100 --> 04:07:35.100
contribute some.

04:07:35.100 --> 04:07:41.100
So our library media specialists have been working on redoing all of our procedures and

04:07:41.100 --> 04:07:45.100
working on a library media procedure manual.

04:07:45.100 --> 04:07:49.100
It's been part of the procedure work that we've been doing as a school district.

04:07:49.100 --> 04:07:53.100
The board was approving policies I think like two years ago and then now we're on the procedure

04:07:53.100 --> 04:07:57.100
side of updating it and making sure that we have procedure manuals for all of our policies as

04:07:57.100 --> 04:08:03.100
well as making sure all of our departments have procedure manuals which so our library media

04:08:03.100 --> 04:08:05.100
services have done this.

04:08:05.100 --> 04:08:11.100
In their procedure manual it denotes that the stakeholders, there was quite a few

04:08:11.100 --> 04:08:17.100
inaccuracies and I've already been in contact with our coordinator of library media science

04:08:17.100 --> 04:08:22.100
who's feeling I would say a little bit frustrated by the inaccuracies that were portrayed,

04:08:22.100 --> 04:08:26.100
especially when someone sends something in an email.

04:08:26.100 --> 04:08:34.100
So it's very clear what Ms. Sills has said and it was very mis-portrayed her message back to the

04:08:34.100 --> 04:08:36.100
individuals who spoke today.

04:08:36.100 --> 04:08:42.100
So there is specific stakeholders, parents, educators, students who can make a request,

04:08:42.100 --> 04:08:48.100
however, a formal request, however, Ms. Sills did promise in the email and I certainly could

04:08:48.100 --> 04:08:52.100
probably pull it up and read it verbatim, but that she would go back to her library media

04:08:52.100 --> 04:08:56.100
specialist and have them just review and make sure that we followed all of our internal policies

04:08:56.100 --> 04:08:58.100
and procedures around selecting a book.

04:08:58.100 --> 04:09:04.100
I can tell you off the top of my head, which is a reason why it's important I think for educators

04:09:04.100 --> 04:09:09.100
and parents and students to have a voice in this as well, one of the books that was mentioned is

04:09:09.100 --> 04:09:12.100
actually on our AP English reading list.

04:09:12.100 --> 04:09:17.100
So, you know, it's interesting just like I'm not a doctor, so I wouldn't sit, well, I am a doctor,

04:09:17.100 --> 04:09:22.100
but I'm not a medical doctor, so I wouldn't sit here and claim to know how to do

04:09:22.100 --> 04:09:25.100
cardiothoracic surgery, right?

04:09:25.100 --> 04:09:29.100
So as educators, if you're not an educator, you might not know that these books are on,

04:09:29.100 --> 04:09:31.100
some of these books are on the AP list.

04:09:31.100 --> 04:09:33.100
I know one specifically is on the AP list.

04:09:33.100 --> 04:09:36.100
So that procedure is available.

04:09:36.100 --> 04:09:37.100
We can make it available to board members.

04:09:37.100 --> 04:09:39.100
I know Mr. Ferrante specifically spoke.

04:09:39.100 --> 04:09:42.100
So again, Ms. Sills did not say anything about a procedure being changed.

04:09:42.100 --> 04:09:44.100
That is incorrect.

04:09:44.100 --> 04:09:46.100
It's a blatant non-truth.

04:09:46.100 --> 04:09:52.100
And so, you know, we would be glad also to reach out to the, I'll be glad to reach out to the ladies

04:09:52.100 --> 04:09:56.100
or specifically the lady, but the ladies who spoke, I'll reach out to them as well.

04:09:56.100 --> 04:10:01.100
But I will also send that procedure manual if anyone else is interested in seeing it.

04:10:01.100 --> 04:10:03.100
They're certainly welcome to see it as well.

04:10:03.100 --> 04:10:05.100
I don't know if that answers.

04:10:06.100 --> 04:10:09.100
Yeah, I think I was just more, that does help.

04:10:09.100 --> 04:10:14.100
I was wondering as far as if anyone is interested in wanting to do that

04:10:14.100 --> 04:10:19.100
and they don't have children in the school, would they reach out specifically to the school directly

04:10:19.100 --> 04:10:21.100
that the book would be positioned at?

04:10:21.100 --> 04:10:23.100
Okay.

04:10:23.100 --> 04:10:26.100
And I'm aware that we didn't have any policy changes.

04:10:26.100 --> 04:10:30.100
The board handles the policy, but the staff handles the procedures.

04:10:30.100 --> 04:10:33.100
So that's what they're in the process of updating.

04:10:33.100 --> 04:10:34.100
Okay.

04:10:34.100 --> 04:10:35.100
All right.

04:10:35.100 --> 04:10:36.100
Thank you.

04:10:36.100 --> 04:10:37.100
You're welcome.

04:10:37.100 --> 04:10:38.100
I appreciate it.

04:10:38.100 --> 04:10:39.100
That's all I have.

04:10:39.100 --> 04:10:40.100
That's all you have.

04:10:40.100 --> 04:10:41.100
Anyone else, Dr. Ennis?

04:10:41.100 --> 04:10:44.100
Just a few quick comments.

04:10:44.100 --> 04:10:47.100
I want to thank everyone who worked in the summer programs.

04:10:47.100 --> 04:10:51.100
I was able to attend some of the summer programs events.

04:10:51.100 --> 04:10:56.100
And thanks to all the staff and teachers and central office folks who organized

04:10:56.100 --> 04:10:59.100
and led those summer programs for our students.

04:10:59.100 --> 04:11:04.100
The stat camp was absolutely phenomenal, as well as the other summer programs.

04:11:04.100 --> 04:11:07.100
And for many of our students, without those summer programs,

04:11:07.100 --> 04:11:10.100
they suffer what we commonly call a summer slide.

04:11:10.100 --> 04:11:14.100
And that means when you come back to school the day after Labor Day,

04:11:14.100 --> 04:11:16.100
teachers have to do a lot of catch-up work.

04:11:16.100 --> 04:11:19.100
And that means they can't move the student forward.

04:11:19.100 --> 04:11:24.100
So I want to thank and commend everyone who worked in those summer programs.

04:11:24.100 --> 04:11:28.100
I also want to thank and commend our central office facilities and maintenance staff,

04:11:28.100 --> 04:11:33.100
who I know worked very hard over the summer because many of the things that they

04:11:33.100 --> 04:11:36.100
postponed during the school year because they can't do something

04:11:36.100 --> 04:11:39.100
because the students are in the building, so they put a rubber band on it

04:11:39.100 --> 04:11:43.100
and wait until the summer to take care of whatever those issues happen to be.

04:11:43.100 --> 04:11:47.100
I also want to thank and commend our school custodial staffs.

04:11:47.100 --> 04:11:51.100
Our school custodial staffs do an absolutely phenomenal job.

04:11:51.100 --> 04:11:54.100
You walk in some of our schools and you say to yourself,

04:11:54.100 --> 04:11:59.100
this school was built in 1970? No, this school wasn't built in 1970.

04:11:59.100 --> 04:12:03.100
Well, it was built in 1970, or it was built in 1996,

04:12:03.100 --> 04:12:05.100
or whatever year it happened to be built.

04:12:05.100 --> 04:12:10.100
And they do an absolutely phenomenal job in stripping wax and buffing floors

04:12:10.100 --> 04:12:14.100
and cleaning desks takes a tremendous amount of time and effort.

04:12:14.100 --> 04:12:18.100
And it means so much to our students and our staff and our families

04:12:18.100 --> 04:12:22.100
when they walk into that school building and see you absolutely spotless

04:12:22.100 --> 04:12:25.100
while taking care of building.

04:12:25.100 --> 04:12:28.100
I also want to thank and commend our coaches.

04:12:28.100 --> 04:12:33.100
I noticed the big sign, August the 9th, started fall practice.

04:12:33.100 --> 04:12:38.100
And as a former coach, I'm glad I was not out on August the 9th

04:12:38.100 --> 04:12:43.100
doing two-a-day football, although I know we can't do two-a-day football anymore,

04:12:43.100 --> 04:12:48.100
but I commend all of our coaches who are out there helping our students be successful.

04:12:48.100 --> 04:12:52.100
And also the band directors, because some are band camp,

04:12:52.100 --> 04:12:55.100
we have outstanding marching bands in our communities

04:12:55.100 --> 04:12:59.100
and I want to thank and congratulate them.

04:12:59.100 --> 04:13:03.100
And also I just wanted to say to everybody, especially the parents out there

04:13:03.100 --> 04:13:08.100
who are sending your kids back, all you have to do is hang in there for 20 more days.

04:13:08.100 --> 04:13:11.100
If you can hang in there for 20 more days,

04:13:11.100 --> 04:13:14.100
they will be on the big yellow stretch limousines

04:13:14.100 --> 04:13:17.100
driven by outstanding school bus drivers

04:13:17.100 --> 04:13:22.100
that show up on our doorstep so you can get a breather for a while.

04:13:22.100 --> 04:13:27.100
So again, final comment is on day after Labor Day,

04:13:27.100 --> 04:13:35.100
I can't believe this, but the class of 2037 will enter our schools.

04:13:35.100 --> 04:13:39.100
I'll say it again, the day after Labor Day,

04:13:39.100 --> 04:13:43.100
the class of 2037 will enter our schools.

04:13:43.100 --> 04:13:46.100
It's just incredible to think about.

04:13:46.100 --> 04:13:50.100
And the decisions we make today will impact their lives.

04:13:50.100 --> 04:13:55.100
So we need to do what we need to do and not just continue to make the right decisions

04:13:55.100 --> 04:13:59.100
for our students who are entering our schools,

04:13:59.100 --> 04:14:01.100
our students who are in our schools,

04:14:01.100 --> 04:14:04.100
and the future students of Worcester County Public Schools.

04:14:04.100 --> 04:14:11.100
So 2037, 20 days parents, hang in there. Thank you.

04:14:11.100 --> 04:14:13.100
Thank you, Dr. Anies.

04:14:13.100 --> 04:14:15.100
Does anyone else have any other comments?

04:14:15.100 --> 04:14:17.100
Mr. McKinnon.

04:14:17.100 --> 04:14:19.100
Thank you.

04:14:19.100 --> 04:14:24.100
I think Dr. Anies kind of took my steam out a little bit in regard to stat camp.

04:14:24.100 --> 04:14:30.100
Last month I was able to stop in probably after the first week.

04:14:30.100 --> 04:14:34.100
I didn't get to make the last week because I wasn't around,

04:14:34.100 --> 04:14:37.100
but Mr. Techwood is very, very impressive.

04:14:37.100 --> 04:14:40.100
I was very, very impressed with it.

04:14:40.100 --> 04:14:46.100
The cutting-edge technology that the students of Worcester County are being exposed to

04:14:46.100 --> 04:14:50.100
is just absolutely phenomenal, phenomenal.

04:14:50.100 --> 04:14:58.100
And it's the collaboration between the county commissioner's funding

04:14:58.100 --> 04:15:03.100
and this program where they fund it, but we make it happen.

04:15:03.100 --> 04:15:07.100
And we make it happen by the expertise of our teachers.

04:15:07.100 --> 04:15:13.100
Because when I was watching them go through and work with the students,

04:15:13.100 --> 04:15:19.100
it made me proud of the teachers of Worcester County.

04:15:19.100 --> 04:15:26.100
I learned a couple new terms, glow-forge and laser printing,

04:15:26.100 --> 04:15:35.100
which I never really thought that I would see that type of technology in a high school.

04:15:35.100 --> 04:15:41.100
That would be something that would probably be in an engineering program in a college.

04:15:41.100 --> 04:15:45.100
So that's my hats off to them.

04:15:45.100 --> 04:15:54.100
The second and last thing is I understand the concern that speakers today

04:15:54.100 --> 04:16:01.100
gave to us in regard to the summer academy and after school.

04:16:01.100 --> 04:16:06.100
I understand the importance of that because when I was still in the classroom,

04:16:06.100 --> 04:16:10.100
I taught summer academy and I taught after school.

04:16:10.100 --> 04:16:16.100
And I could see how students reacted to that and how important it was

04:16:16.100 --> 04:16:22.100
to continue that school day or to continue that school year.

04:16:22.100 --> 04:16:25.100
And I think I've said this before too.

04:16:25.100 --> 04:16:30.100
You've got kids in the summertime that want to go back to school

04:16:30.100 --> 04:16:36.100
and whether they're going into an academic area or going into, in my case,

04:16:36.100 --> 04:16:42.100
an artistic area, it's just great.

04:16:42.100 --> 04:16:45.100
I just don't have any other words for that.

04:16:45.100 --> 04:16:50.100
But to the teachers that spoke, I hear you.

04:16:50.100 --> 04:16:54.100
I really do. I understand. I understand. Thank you.

04:16:54.100 --> 04:16:57.100
Thanks. Anyone else have any comments?

04:16:57.100 --> 04:17:00.100
I do want to make an announcement.

04:17:00.100 --> 04:17:04.100
Last, it's been a couple of weeks ago that Vice President Buchanan, myself,

04:17:04.100 --> 04:17:09.100
Superintendent Taylor were able to join President Bertino

04:17:09.100 --> 04:17:12.100
from the county commissioners along with Vice President Bunning

04:17:12.100 --> 04:17:15.100
and the county administrator, Mr. Weston Young.

04:17:15.100 --> 04:17:19.100
We had a very meaningful discussion.

04:17:19.100 --> 04:17:23.100
We talked about how we can get together in advance

04:17:23.100 --> 04:17:26.100
and try to work through things in the future year.

04:17:26.100 --> 04:17:32.100
And we decided that it would be beneficial for our boards to have a joint meeting.

04:17:32.100 --> 04:17:34.100
And we will be planning on doing that.

04:17:34.100 --> 04:17:36.100
I do not have a time and date for you right now

04:17:36.100 --> 04:17:39.100
because our board just agreed to do it today.

04:17:39.100 --> 04:17:44.100
It was a conversation Mr. Bertino and I had after he cleared it with his board.

04:17:44.100 --> 04:17:48.100
So we will be getting together in an open meeting so everyone can attend.

04:17:48.100 --> 04:17:51.100
And that will happen sometime in the near future.

04:17:51.100 --> 04:17:52.100
And we will let you know.

04:17:52.100 --> 04:17:55.100
We will make the announcement to let you know when that's going to happen.

04:17:55.100 --> 04:17:58.100
And before I adjourn the meeting today

04:17:58.100 --> 04:18:00.100
and turn it over to Mr. Taylor for informational items,

04:18:00.100 --> 04:18:04.100
you know, I always heard about Jim Ahman,

04:18:04.100 --> 04:18:08.100
who had been the board attorney here for 25 years.

04:18:08.100 --> 04:18:09.100
He had been the board attorney here.

04:18:09.100 --> 04:18:12.100
And I never thought I'd have the opportunity to sit at the table with him

04:18:12.100 --> 04:18:14.100
when he was a board attorney.

04:18:14.100 --> 04:18:17.100
But he filled in today for Ms. Stansberry.

04:18:17.100 --> 04:18:19.100
And Jim, I'm happy to see you here.

04:18:19.100 --> 04:18:22.100
Thanks for being back.

04:18:22.100 --> 04:18:32.100
And now turn it over to Mr. Taylor for the following informational items.

04:18:32.100 --> 04:18:33.100
Mr. Taylor?

04:18:33.100 --> 04:18:34.100
Thank you, Mr. Fronte.

04:18:34.100 --> 04:18:37.100
Just a few announcements today before we dismiss.

04:18:37.100 --> 04:18:43.100
On August 28th, remember that date, all teachers returned to our buildings.

04:18:43.100 --> 04:18:49.100
That's right around the corner, about 14 days maybe, 13 days.

04:18:49.100 --> 04:18:53.100
All of our schools the first week have open houses or back to school

04:18:53.100 --> 04:18:56.100
or some event for their schools or at least most of them to do.

04:18:56.100 --> 04:18:59.100
And I do have some dates, and I'm going to run through them quickly

04:18:59.100 --> 04:19:02.100
in case you want to take note or whatever.

04:19:02.100 --> 04:19:06.100
But on August 29th, Stephen Decatur Middle will have an open house

04:19:06.100 --> 04:19:08.100
back to school from 5 to 7.

04:19:08.100 --> 04:19:14.100
On August 30th, the Pocomoke area schools will be all down at Cypress Park

04:19:14.100 --> 04:19:15.100
from 5 to 7.

04:19:15.100 --> 04:19:17.100
That's always a very neat event.

04:19:17.100 --> 04:19:24.100
The same evening, Snow Hill area schools will be having everybody back,

04:19:24.100 --> 04:19:26.100
and that's another neat event.

04:19:26.100 --> 04:19:29.100
We're able as an executive team to visit both of those.

04:19:29.100 --> 04:19:35.100
The Snow Hill area schools is from 5 to 7, and Cedar Chapel is from 3 to 5.

04:19:35.100 --> 04:19:37.100
So again, looking forward to that event.

04:19:37.100 --> 04:19:41.100
Buckingham Elementary School on August 30th will have theirs,

04:19:41.100 --> 04:19:44.100
have a back to school barbecue from 3 to 5.

04:19:44.100 --> 04:19:51.100
Also on the 30th, Snow Hill High School from 8 to 12 will have freshman orientation.

04:19:51.100 --> 04:19:56.100
And on August 30th, the Berlin Intermediate School will have their event from 5 to 7.

04:19:56.100 --> 04:20:02.100
Moving on to August 31st, Pocomoke Elementary School will have theirs from 3 to 5.

04:20:02.100 --> 04:20:09.100
Buckingham Elementary School will have a 930 to 11 pre-K open house.

04:20:09.100 --> 04:20:14.100
And on the 31st also, Ocean City Elementary will have theirs from 10 to 12.

04:20:14.100 --> 04:20:21.100
Also the same day, Snow Hill, excuse me, Schell Elementary School will have theirs from 10 to 12.

04:20:21.100 --> 04:20:27.100
And Stephen Decatur High School on the 31st will have their famous freshman Seahawk Day.

04:20:27.100 --> 04:20:30.100
Boy, do I remember those, from 930 to 12.

04:20:30.100 --> 04:20:36.100
And then that same day, Pocomoke High School will have their freshman Warrior Day.

04:20:36.100 --> 04:20:43.100
So all great events coming, and the most famous date that I will announce to you, September the 5th,

04:20:43.100 --> 04:20:46.100
everybody comes back to school.

04:20:46.100 --> 04:20:50.100
So we're looking forward to, we're really back in gear now,

04:20:50.100 --> 04:20:53.100
but we're looking forward to some great events as we kick off the school year.

04:20:53.100 --> 04:20:56.100
There's a handful of teachers still sitting in here.

04:20:56.100 --> 04:20:59.100
And I will say as your superintendent, I'm very proud to serve with you.

04:20:59.100 --> 04:21:04.100
And I'm very honored to see the level of work that you do each and every day

04:21:04.100 --> 04:21:06.100
for the young people in our schools.

04:21:06.100 --> 04:21:09.100
And if you could pass that along to your colleagues as your superintendent,

04:21:09.100 --> 04:21:14.100
I'm very, very honored to be alongside you as we take this journey each and every year.

04:21:14.100 --> 04:21:15.100
Thank you, Todd.

04:21:15.100 --> 04:21:17.100
Thank you, Mr. Taylor.

04:21:17.100 --> 04:21:23.100
The next regular Worcester County Board of Education meeting will be held Tuesday, September 19th,

04:21:23.100 --> 04:21:27.100
in the Sarah D. Thompson Board Meeting Room of Worcester County Board of Education Central Office,

04:21:27.100 --> 04:21:30.100
located at 6270 Worcester Highway, Newark, Maryland.
