Good morning, everyone. Seeing that our board members are now present, I hereby call the July 2023 meeting of the State Board of Education to order at 8 33 a.m. And I'd like to commence by saluting the flag member Porter, will you please lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance.
Thank you very much.
I'd like to welcome board members staff and members of the public who are attending this board meeting in person. I'd like to encourage everyone in the room to wear masks which are available at the back of the room if you need one and thank you for your consideration.
There is one item on the agenda that has an agenda item 11. The agenda is for the mathematics framework staff recommended edits based on public comment.
The consent calendar includes the proposed waiver consent items that are W one through W 14. The proposed regular consent items are items four through 10.
There are two public hearings on the agenda. Item 11 adoption of the 2023 mathematics framework for California public schools kindergarten through grade 12 and item 13 appeal from an action of the Santa Clara County Committee on school district organization to disapprove a petition to transfer territory from the San Jose Unified School District to the Oak Grove Elementary School District in the East Side Union High School District.
We will now reopen item one. We will reopen item one later this morning to honor our student board member Naomi Porter. We will also reopen item one tomorrow to take action on the preliminary report of actions draft may 2023 meeting minutes and to report on our liaison assignments.
The proposed consent calendar items four through 10 will be taken up after item two items 14 and 15 were withdrawn from the agenda on Monday July 3rd 2023.
Those items concern the appeal by petitioner New Pacific School Yuba City of the denial of the charter petition.
The SBE withdrew these items at the request of the charter petitioner.
Item 17 was added to the agenda on Friday July 7th 2023 which is an action item to set aside the State Board of Education September 15 2022 reversal of the denials of the Maya commas charter middle school petition to comply with a writ of mandate to be issued by the Sacramento Superior Court in two cases.
Napa Valley Unified School District versus California State Board of Education and California School Boards Association Education Legal Alliance versus California State Board of Education.
Tomorrow morning the board will determine whether to take an action on the item and vote on the proposed recommendation.
In terms of public comment public comment will be accepted either in person or by phone members of the public wishing to call in for public comment should view the live stream of the meeting to know what time public comment will occur for each item.
Public comment may be provided by dialing the phone number entering a participant access code and then following each of the operators prompts upon dialing in callers will be added to a caller queue.
The operator will notify callers when it is their turn to provide public comment.
We will also ask callers to please turn down the speaker volume of their computers if they're following the live webcast to avoid an echoing effect.
Members of the public wishing to provide public comment in person should sign in using the binder at the table just outside the room.
The binder is on the table with separate pages for each item number.
This will help ensure that staff is able to track the in-person speakers for each particular item.
Public comment will be limited to one minute per speaker where speakers require interpretation two minutes will be provided.
Item 16 is the general public comment item during which members of the public may provide comment on matters that are not specifically listed on the board's agenda.
I will now open item one which is our state board projects and priorities item and turn the podium over to State Superintendent Tony Thurman for his report.
Thank you Madam President and members of the board and to those who are here today.
I want to start by just acknowledging that during summer this is a very important time for our students.
I know it's important for them to get in all their activities and all their fun,
but it's also important time to support enrichment and learning and to prevent learning slide.
And I want to acknowledge two partners who are helping us to launch important programs in the next several weeks that will support student enrichment.
And this builds on the state's investment in four billion dollars for expanded learning programs.
One is the freedom school program which many of you know is an Afro centric literacy intervention program that helps students improve their grade levels by as many as two grade levels sometimes in as short as six weeks.
We want to thank the freedom school who will be piloting a great program for us as well as a partnership with the calculus roundtable.
As we talk about the mathematics framework today, it's not lost on me that there are many partners who are engaged in how we help our students be involved in rigorous conversations about mathematics.
And the calculus roundtable is working with many school districts across the state and they'll be working with us to launch some pilots that focus on STEAM Academy and helping our students to develop a love for mathematics.
I also want to thank and acknowledge and congratulate our student board member, Naomi Porter.
I thank you for your incredible insights here.
Thank you for your incredible service, which we know will continue.
I expect to see you back on this dais as board president or a senator or governor or president, whatever it is that you choose.
I was really grateful to be able to work with you and your colleagues at Palos Verdes Peninsula High School who raised up such important points of advocacy about how we support mental health for our students.
Thank you again.
And if I could ask for us all to just show our appreciation to you.
I know that there will be other remarks for you today, so just be prepared.
I wanted to thank you for your service.
I wanted to acknowledge and thank all of you who came to this place for our Pride flag raising ceremony.
We hoisted the first ever, for the first time ever, on this building, the Progress Pride flag.
This is a Pride flag that captures the intersection of race and gender, and it was a tremendous ceremony.
And I would just say at a critical time when there are those who would challenge the values of inclusive education.
We know that inclusive education promotes academic achievement.
It supports social development, and it is why we raised the Pride flag.
It is why we talk about inclusion in education.
It is why we held a great hearing with many textbook publishers who voluntarily said that they want to broaden the content of what goes into our textbooks, of what our students see.
So that our students see representations of themselves, the diversity that our schools and communities represent.
And I'm grateful for those textbook providers who joined us and those legislators who joined our Task Force on Inclusive Education.
I would also note that we have sponsored a bill that would, let me back up.
I would just say that I don't think California is going to be a part of this trend that we see going on in the nation where people ban books.
We don't ban books in California, especially books that help students of color and LGBTQ plus students see themselves and have access to inclusive education.
And I want to thank all of you who stood with us as we say this is not what California students should get.
While there have been some examples of some who have teetered on the line of what book banning might look like, this is not something that we will stand for for California students.
I want to thank all of you who joined with us as we've written content for AB 1078 by Assemblymember Jackson.
A bill that would essentially put a fee on any school district that bans a book in attempts to discriminate against our students in the state of California.
California will continue to lead the way in this area and there are tough challenges.
We've put out guidance, we've put out letters between our office, the governor's office, the attorney general's office.
That guidance and much of the language that's in AB 1078 is shaped by the contributions of our board president and our state board of education staff.
And I want to thank you all for standing with us as we as we put that forward.
So we think that there are better days ahead, but we have to be vigilant to show that we will stand for inclusive education because it benefits our kids.
We celebrate the completion of another budget cycle while revenue has been down for the state.
By and large, revenue for education in the budget has held strong.
There are a number of programs and you'll hear some of them throughout the day, but I'm excited to share with you a key program as we continue our conversation about recruiting school staff and in particular teachers.
For us to move forward with TK or bilingual education, special education, we know that we need more teachers and I'm excited that this year's budget includes an increase to the stipend for the teacher residency program.
Many of you know that we authored SB 765 for that very purpose with Senator Portantino to call for the expansion of the residency stipend.
And there's nothing like getting it done in the budget.
So we're grateful to the governor, to the state board of education and team and others, the Department of Finance, who helped to land that in the budget.
You're going to hear a lot of great resources about literacy that are in this budget, the literacy roadmap.
Thank you, Dr. Darling-Hammond and others for your vision to help us find a way to land conversations about how our students improve reading proficiency and develop a love for reading at the same time.
The literacy roadmap will do just that, an additional million dollars to support how we guide our school districts in the work that they need to do.
The equity multiplier, which will provide 300 million dollars to support our work in engaging our entire educational field and how we promote more black student achievement.
So many great things to talk about, more resources for how we do screening around dyslexia, but to not just screen for dyslexia, but to also think about anything that puts a student at risk for not learning to read that we will be able to have appropriate resources to support them.
We're continuing to build on Prop 98 and Prop 28 and the nearly billion dollars that will be available for arts education, arts and music education.
We're engaged in robust discussions with the Commission on Teacher Credentialing, with the Department of Finance and others on how we can create a specialized credential to make it possible for someone who is a practitioner in arts and music to be able to work in the classroom.
Alongside a classroom educator to do the great work that is needed.
The last point in the budget that I will mention is 20 million dollars to support training for our bilingual educators, also something that grew out of legislation that we sponsored this year.
We're excited that we will continue our conversation to promote bilingual education because we know that when we promote bilingual education, we support the brain development of our students.
We create global thinkers of the world, and we should all be able to read and write in more than one language.
And so, as I often say, the state of education in California is hopeful.
We have a lot of work to do, for sure, but California has more resources than any other state, and this budget bolsters that.
More resources for universal preschool, for universal meals, for expanding mental health programs, and supports in community schools.
And I thank this board for your action at the last meeting to add an additional set of resources for community schools for our school districts.
They need it more than ever. You all hear it from them. I hear it when I visit, but the state of education is hopeful.
We have the resources to try a new course for every student in our state. Madam President, if I could, I'd like to just acknowledge two staff who have long served us in our transitioning.
And I know they may get acknowledged at different times, but I wanted to acknowledge Larry Sherry, who is here today, who served 23 years here at the Department of Education.
And some 13 years in education at the Santa Clara County Office of Education before that.
Thank you, Larry, for your efforts here to support a number of reorganizations of school districts.
You know, being a primary contact of support for our county superintendents, sharing your expertise and your experience on a number of matters that are in education code.
And if possible, Madam President would like to provide the certificate of recognition to Larry and ask if you would come forward to the podium.
Larry, we'd like to congratulate you on 23 years of service.
Congratulations and thank you for 23 years of service. I turn the microphone over to you. Thank you.
One more time for Larry. 37 years in the field are a lot of people think I'm not going to try to go through everybody.
Certainly that would take I'd be doing this through tomorrow, but I would just like to call out a couple of groups, a few groups, you know, starting with your staff.
You know, you have incredible staff that are working with you now and have worked the state boards throughout the years.
We have worked very closely together to not only orchestrate bringing reorganization issues before you, but also on legislation to address issues in district reorganization, including some very successful efforts over the last few years and peeling back some of the district.
Responsibilities you have and putting them back on the counties also like to thank you and previous state board members.
The insights that you've provided on on all the reorganization issues that we brought before you have been invaluable to see the different perspectives.
Colleagues here at the department often look at me a disbelief when I say this has been a highlight of what I do here is responding to board questions, responding to board comments, because it's such a learning experience to get those perspectives.
Excuse me, get those perspectives on the issues.
And of course, we've got just an incredible staff here at the department that work with me and work with the whole reorganization team on on our issues.
They touch reorganizing districts, touch a lot of things.
Facilities, fiscal, educational program, equity, charter schools, data management and a myriad of legal issues and the program staff and the legal staff we hear have been outstanding to work with.
And that doesn't even account for the flexibility that all levels of administration have given us as we as we work through the efforts, the issues that to bring to you.
And finally, I just want to address a group that doesn't get enough recognition here.
Certainly the legislature has given you the state board the oversight and responsibility for district organization, but it all starts at the local level.
And it's the county superintendent of school superintendents of schools and their staff who are in the trenches dealing with what can be very emotional and political issues.
And this doesn't happen at the board level without the information and the work that they put in.
You know, I've been a privilege for me to spend 14 years as part of that group in accounting office of education and spending my last 23 years supporting them in their work.
They do. So thank you all very much.
And I will see you tomorrow morning when we hit the next reorganization item.
Thank you.
You just keeping it consistent on to the next reorganization item. Madam President, I would just also want to acknowledge our special education director Heather Calamese, who will be taking a new position at Ed voice, who's helped to steer much of our service during the
pandemic and we're grateful for her service.
And I wanted to acknowledge the appointment and we put a reappointment process for two of our board members, Allison Yoshimoto towery and reappointment to President Darling Hammond and to Dr.
Francisco Escobedo on your successful Senate rules hearing.
If we could only get our US Senate to do the same.
But I would like to also acknowledge the appointment and reappointment for all of you and congratulations.
This concludes my report. Happy to take any questions.
Thank you so very much.
We do have a packed agenda today, so I'm going to keep my report short, but this is our only summer meeting.
So there are a few things to highlight in addition to those that Superintendent Thurman did.
First of all, I'm pleased to join Superintendent Thurman in offering my heartfelt thanks to Larry Shiree for his service to California schools and families.
Most of all, we're grateful for Larry's expert service to this board where he has helped navigate tricky issues so we can make good decisions.
For over 20 years, Larry has been the lead on school district organization matters and he's made thoughtful analysis of 61 territory transfer appeals,
24 school district unification proposals and over 400 waivers related to school district organization process.
He's been very busy in those 23 years. His attention to detail has been invaluable.
His pleasant and professional demeanor have been a pleasure for all of us who have worked with him.
He's also been instrumental in collaboration with state board staff and developing legislative proposals to return some school district organization responsibilities back to local control at the county level, as he mentioned.
State Board of Education is grateful to Larry for his steady, dedicated service.
Congratulations on a well-deserved retirement, which we know you have postponed twice.
And as a small token of our large appreciation, we will also have a certificate for you and we will wish you all the things in your retirement.
So thank you, Larry, once again.
I don't know. Oh, there it is.
I have to find your certificates so that I can give it to you.
Probably should have done that at the same time.
Yes. So again, thank you all. It's been a pleasure working with you and pleasure working with your staff.
It certainly has been a pleasure with being here at the Department of Education.
And, you know, congratulations on me.
We'll see you tomorrow for the next territory reorganization appeal.
As Superintendent Thurmond also mentioned, this is the last meeting for our wonderful student board member, Naomi Porter.
There is much to say about Naomi and the great service she has provided the state and the board as the voice of 5.8 million students.
And we will save those comments for later in the day, but they are heartfelt and coming soon.
And at our next meeting in September, we will welcome our new student board member,
Anya Ayyappan, a senior at Doherty Valley High School in San Ramon.
She's a school leader, a student journalist, a member of the speech and debate team.
So I expect some lively conversations.
As you know, Governor Newsom did sign the 2023 Budget Act and the related trailer bill.
And as Superintendent Thurmond noted, despite the difficulties in the general budget,
We have strong fiscal support for schools, which includes an 8.2 percent cost of living increase to the local control funding formula,
which is on top of the nearly 40 percent increase over the last four years.
So we are continuing to make those investments.
Other noteworthy budget highlights besides the ones that Superintendent Thurmond called out,
which included those investments in teacher recruitment, include almost a billion dollars for the music and art, art, music and schools,
funding guarantee, substantial investments in universal T.K., enrollment growth,
another 250 million dollars for literacy coaches and reading specialists,
investments in restorative justice best practices grants, thanks to our state superintendent,
and a new diverse education leaders pipeline initiative, which I'm very excited about, which is also at the initiative of our state superintendent.
There's a great good news in the budget trailer bills, too,
including the first comprehensive improvements to the local control funding formula accountability side of the program since that bill was signed in 2013.
And these are amendments that you are familiar with, I think,
that are intended to ensure student group or school level equity gaps being identified and addressed through the LCAP and differentiated assistive processes.
That goes along with the equity multiplier that Superintendent Thurmond noted.
So there will be an investment of resources,
but also an expectation that in every district, student groups and school groups that have been failing will get attention and resources for their opportunity,
closing opportunity gaps as well as outcome gaps.
And you heard about the literacy screening bill that has been enacted that will ensure that students at risk of reading difficulties receive appropriate progress
monitoring interventions and support.
The budget asked the State Board of Education to establish a panel of experts to develop a list of literacy screeners appropriate for our multilingual population
that LEAs can use to begin screening pupils in kindergarten through second grade, beginning by the 2025-26 school year.
So it's not easy to land a budget like this during a year of fiscal cutbacks.
I'm very grateful to all the folks in the legislature and the administration for working so hard to ensure that our schools have the support they need to continue to accelerate learning for our students.
I especially want to thank Governor Newsom for his vision and leadership.
When it comes to the importance of a high quality public education for every California student,
I want to thank the members of the Senate Rules Committee for providing me and members Escobedo and Yoshimoto Tauri the opportunity to answer questions.
During our recent confirmation hearing, it was an honor to appear before them.
And finally, today, the Office of the Surgeon General is launching its Safe Spaces training modules for school staff.
This is a free online training designed to help early care providers as well as TK through 12 educators and other school personnel recognize and respond to trauma and stress in children.
This training will help give educators the knowledge and skills to recognize the effects of trauma in their students,
to engage in support of healing-oriented practices, and to connect students to additional mental health resources where needed.
This training was made possible through the California's Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative,
which is a five-year, $4.7 billion initiative that is transforming the way that California supports children,
youth, and families, and the Department of Health and Human Services has been working closely with folks in the Department of Education and the State Board
in trying to figure out how those resources can make their way productively to students in schools as well as beyond.
So I'm excited to see another resource for educators and school personnel that helps them build positive environments that support students' learning and development,
which is what we have been working on for these last several years.
And with that, my report is concluded, and we will move on to Item 2.
Item 2 is the update on the implementation of the Integrated Local, State, and Federal Accountability and Continuous Improvement System.
It's an addendum to the continuing work and revisions under consideration for the 2023 Dashboard Related to the Chronic Absenteeism Indicator.
And the item will be presented by Cindy Kazanis of the CDE. Cindy, welcome and please begin.
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond, good morning Superintendent Thurmond, members of the board.
I'm Cindy Kazanis, the Director of the Analysis, Measurement, and Accountability Reporting Division.
I want to echo your congratulations to Larry.
He was one of the first people I met when I came to the department a couple of decades ago, and he's a great colleague.
I also wanted to share with you we've been busy on the data side.
We do do things outside of accountability in my division.
And really pleased to share with you that we have our second year of teacher data out for our Teacher Assignment Monitoring Outcomes Report, which we're very proud of.
Later this week, we should have up our updated information, our college going rate reports.
We also recently released updated information on the Long-Term English Learner data as well.
And so we have been busy again outside of the dashboard and also to recognize Superintendent Thurmond and President Darling-Hammond's leadership in getting us additional positions with this year's budget.
We're very grateful that we will have over a dozen new staff working on data reporting.
Some of those will be to support our teacher reports, which we are backlogged on, as well as a new data science office.
And then finally, for those of you that don't follow this, the dashboard now has a due date.
So publicly we'll be releasing it this year on December 15th, next year, December 1st, then November 15th.
I think that's the progression. And then October 15th, the following year.
So we have our work ahead of us to move up the schedule two months over the next four years.
And my staff is planning very diligently on how we can get there.
We're going to need to change some of our processes.
But a huge thank you again to the leadership to recognize that there were needs on the data reporting side and that those have been funded.
Now we just need to find some staff.
So if you know of any great individuals who like data, come work for the Department of Education.
With that in mind, the summer always brings to us students and I'm pleased that we have for I think it's a fifth or sixth year in a row, a student from Stanford.
Alan Lopez is helping us this year with accountability measures.
And then we have a student assistant for the first time, and that's Olivia Chanda.
And she's in the audience this morning and she's helping us with some legal matters.
So let's get started on the item. We are here today.
This was not a planned presentation, but happy to take up where you left off, I think, with your last item in May and this being your first item in July to talk about chronic absenteeism.
So specifically, there was an attachment that provided a great deal of background and options for your consideration on potentially modifying the chronic absenteeism indicator for the 2023 dashboard.
The recommendation before you today is that we are asking for your guidance and direction if you'd like to make changes or would like to see the indicator explored as part of the 2023 accountability work plan.
Specifically, the work plan is something we bring to you every March.
Every March, maybe we have to move it up, depending on this new deadline in October in four years.
But for now, it's March, meaning we're bringing to you things that you've expressed over the year that you've updated, things that we've been working on.
Some of these, of course, are multi-year projects.
And so at the March meeting, this was a conversation, but there was no direction given.
And so at the May meeting, there was some public comment.
There was also, I think, some conversations that have been, individuals have been very vocal in not only, we know of the issues around chronic absenteeism and the stark reality of students not able to come to school this last year.
So with that in mind, you had asked us or President Darling-Hammett asked us to bring this back as a conversation for this meeting at your May meeting.
So let's get into the attachment and just a brief overview.
I'm sure you guys all know this very well, but just in case, the indicator is one in which we look at for kindergarten through at grade eight.
That is specifically because we needed to balance out the indicators for the Every Student Succeeds Act state plans.
That's what was approved.
It is defined as the percentage of students who are absent for 10 percent or more instructional days they were expected to attend.
We usually think about 180 day school year.
Sometimes students are only in school for 30 days and so thinking or 60 days, let's use that as an example.
So thinking about 10 percent of 60 days, you know, it's proportional.
So keep in mind, too, that the words expected to attend if there was a school closure due to natural disasters like we saw in Pajaro or other locations.
Those meant that most likely that the school was closed.
Students were not expected to attend and they are not included in the calculation of the indicator specifically as well related to the state plan.
This indicator serves as our other academic indicator.
And again, we talked about it being grades K through eight.
And so what does it mean to be chronically absent and what absences are included at that?
We have we have a very limited set of data we work with that we are collect.
We collect from school districts on an annual basis.
Specifically, we ask how many days are expected to attend, how many days they attended and what type of absence they had.
And the absences that they can list is excused, unexcused, out of school suspension days and non generating independent study days.
We don't have any more depth of knowledge.
We don't know if students were absent due to covid.
We don't know if there was an unexcused absence because there was a death in the family.
There is no granularity attached to this information, nor do we know if it's the first Monday of the month in which a student was gone.
We just had those again high level aggregate numbers.
But at the student level, so let me keep that in mind, it's at the student level.
And so we're able to actually look at, of course, student student group trends.
And that's how we get to having this on the dashboard.
But in 2023, this fall, we will see colors on the dashboard.
We'll be able to look not only at status, but we'll be able to look at change.
So there's even a little incremental progress, point five percent progress in chronic absenteeism.
You will see a color change.
You will see impact based on what you've already what this board has already adopted in prior years.
So keep in mind that status plus change equals that color.
And you can see below an example of a declined change level, decline of point five or point three, which is an improvement.
We'll get you a color change.
And if it's over three percent, it'll be declined significantly.
And so we will see, we think, depending on how schools are doing this current this past year, that's just concluded.
We will see potentially a lot of change in the system.
So this is the chart that we use.
We call this the five by five performance grid.
And of course, looking at current year on the on the left hand side with performance levels starting at the top, very low, low, medium and very high.
And of course, that's reverse for other indicators such as academic indicator.
And then at the top, if we go across that row, what happened in the current year?
Did we increase from the prior year?
Did we maintain or did we decline?
And so really that those last two columns are where we we we know if there is, again, just a slight increase in our improvement in reducing chronic absenteeism.
Schools will be recognized, districts will be recognized, student groups will be recognized and potentially may not have the extreme number of schools and districts in our system of support.
We did provide in the item five different recommendations.
I think I left out one, which is status quo.
You always have the right to just say, just continue to do what we have been doing and let's give it another year.
I will have to tell you, we no longer have we no longer do crystal ball predictions.
We are collecting the data now.
I don't know what that data looks like, and I'm hesitant to even, you know, reach out to school districts to ask, you know, how are things going?
I've heard, of course, anecdotally throughout the year from districts expressing what they've been trying to do to get students back in school, what they've been doing to increase the outreach.
Of course, Superintendent Thurman's webinar series highlighted that beginning when the data first came out.
And so thinking about those considerations, we wanted to also make sure that we said out loud we have not run any of these options by the traditional groups.
We would run them by including the California practitioners advisory group, which is required by federal statute to provide you guidance on modifications to to to our accountability indicators.
So with that in mind, high level short term modifications again between now and your September meeting, which is, I think, just over 60 days, we could potentially do one of the following.
Again, looking at the cut points for status or change, the only data, of course, that's available to us is the data from the prior year from 2022.
And then if we went back to 2019, so, you know, as far as calculations, it's not like I can, again, predict what we're going to see for 2023, but that's an option.
Looking at literally just the color boxes, if you want to move the color boxes around on the five by five chart, that is an option as well.
And then looking at the chronic absenteeism student calculation methodology.
So if there's an interest in removing excused absences from the calculation and changing this to more of a truancy indicator, that is one option we provided for your consideration as well.
For long term modifications, again, taking maybe multiple dashboard years to get to modifying what we talked about in terms of the student level data system.
The information collected around student absences and then option to be replacing the indicator altogether.
So, you know, we gave you a range from probably the conservative to the extreme and happy to, with that, turn it back to President Darlene Hammond for public comment.
You see the recommendation before you, which, of course, is to provide guidance to us so that we can land this dashboard in September and publish it by the required new due date of December 15th.
Thank you so very much. We appreciate it.
We're going to now open the phone line for the public comment queue. Members of the public wishing to provide comment on this item may do so in person or by using the telephone number and the access code that is provided on the slide shown now.
While we're waiting for members of the public to call in, I want to ask our liaison, Vice President Glover Woods, if she has any additional comments before me and then I'll see if there are any clarifying questions before we go to public comment.
Thank you, President Darlene Hammond and good morning to everyone and thank you, Cindy, as always for a phenomenal presentation and to your staff for all of the work that is done.
I want to just kind of preface my remarks with the chronic absenteeism indicator has been a strong one in our system and one that we want to be sure continues to provide schools and districts with the information they need for students to really avail themselves of in-person instruction.
And again, a lot of work has been done.
We also know is that as a result to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and many of the natural disasters our school systems have encountered, it has had a strong impact on attendance.
And I really believe and I say to all of you that along our principle for accountability system of continuous improvement, it's important for us to take a look at the chronic absenteeism indicator to be sure that it will still do and provide the valuable information that we know our field needs to again be sure that students can avail themselves of the rigorous in-person instruction and instruction in general.
With that being said, I appreciate the short-term and long-term options and I will say that to Cindy's point during her presentation, the value of the voices of the field, our school partners, district partners, our educational partners, their value, the value of their voice is so critical to what is being done.
And there's not time to get that voice in time for the 2023 dashboard.
Cindy outlined the timeline very, very clearly.
So I want us to definitely keep that in mind as we think about what exploration may need to be done.
And I would encourage us to look at that.
However, I would encourage us to look at it in light of what may come forward in the 2024 dashboard and understanding the tight timeframe we have for 2023 to keep that in mind as we listen to our public comment and as we engage in our board discussion.
Thank you and I'll just add to your comments that I'm very grateful to Cindy and her staff for putting these options before us.
There's a lot on their plates and this is just one additional thing to be worried about.
What happened, as many of you know, last year was that with the COVID-19 pandemic and districts being responsive to the need for quarantining and for carefulness around attending to health and wellness, there was a huge spike in chronic absenteeism rates.
About 600 districts were placed in differentiated assistance, which is out of our 1,000 districts.
That's a lot.
I think in Vice President Glover Woods County, all of the districts were in that.
And the chronic absenteeism indicator is a very, very important one for us because it really does trigger for districts the importance of finding out what's keeping kids from school and getting them in.
A lot of very valuable work has gone on with attendance campaigns and so on around it.
But it does get very complicated when our system is unable to sort out who needs that kind of assistance and who is showing those high absenteeism rates, either because of the extraordinary snows and rains and floods and fires that we've had that have kept some kids from being able to get to school or because of health reasons.
So the questions ahead of us will be whether we at some point want to re-bench the standard for the indicator, whether we want to find ways to differentiate between reasons for absences so that we can be more strategic and diagnostic about how to help districts,
and whether we can also explore things that are beyond the indicator, such as how to have makeup time for districts to get kids to school when they can be, or how to make it more possible for online options so that we're really making learning about education, not about place, where place is difficult for everyone to get to.
So anyway, we'll have opportunities. Some of these are long-term questions for us, not questions that will get resolved or new policies that will get resolved in the next couple of months.
But we want to be able to have a full conversation about how to maintain a meaningful indicator that is helpful to the purposes that it intends to serve and how also to get kids maximum levels of education and to make it possible in what is going to be an uncertain future to have them engaged in learning.
So with that, I think we want to open this up to public comment, unless there are any other clarifying questions for members of the board at this point before we get to discussion.
Seeing no hands, we will go to public comment.
Are there any speakers signed up for public comment in person?
We have one speaker signed up.
Thank you.
Here we go.
Good morning, members of the Board of Education and staff.
This is Manuel Bonrostro, Director of Policy at Californians Together, and I'm calling in regards to the progress on the English Learner Progress Indicator.
As you know, we've called in about this item multiple times before.
What is the next item?
I think.
The English language learner.
No? Okay, go ahead.
Thank you.
So we're calling about the update about the item in terms of asking the board to ensure that the five by five matrix that has updated LP cut scores be released with adequate time for there to be reviewed by stakeholders and staff before approval at the September State Board of Education meeting.
We believe this is an item where we just request additional time for stakeholders and other members of the public to be able to look at it.
It's an item that we think right now still sets low expectations for English Learner Progress and we hope that there's sample opportunity for us to be able to provide additional feedback on this one.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you. Are there any call in commenters?
Yes, we do have quite a number of callers in the queue.
I would like to remind the callers that we are currently taking public comment for item number two only.
And if you are on the line for another item, if you could please hang up and dial back in when you hear your item is up.
Thank you.
And with that, I will open the phone line.
Good morning. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.
Hi, this is Hedy Kang. I am the executive director of attendance work.
I really appreciate that the board recognizes that chronic absenteeism is a crucial measure of student engagement for supporting school improvement and ensuring more equitable outcomes.
We recognize, though, that we need to refine the measure to ensure that districts and schools feel supported and not blamed and can take positive action to improve student outcomes.
We suggest the board consider the following. First, modify the cut points for status and change levels based upon the school year 21 and 22 data so we can prioritize the places that need the most support given current conditions.
Second, we really advise against excluding any absences when calculating chronic absence.
Every day a student is absent regardless of the reason they are missing out on an opportunity to learn, build relationships and access supports.
Third, we encourage you to explore temporarily waiving accountability for districts and schools when they have experienced severe external conditions.
And we finally really encourage looking at make-up opportunities when students miss too much school, whether that's through expanded learning or online learning.

President Hammond, members of the board, greetings from Lake Tahoe Unified School District in South Lake Tahoe.
I am Alan Reader, Associate Superintendent calling in for Superintendent Todd Cutler.
First, we appreciate your consideration of this important matter today. Thank you.
South Lake Tahoe experienced the Caldor fire in 21-22 and lost 17 days with fire and snow.
This past year we had an epic winter and lost 12 days of snow.
We scheduled three days to make those days up, but unfortunately have been unable to get 180 days in for our students these past two years.
Additionally, we too are dealing with excessive chronic absenteeism and are looking for strategies to reduce this absenteeism through a variety of action steps.
We would love to see unexcused absences only be considered toward the chronic absenteeism rate.
We hope you will consider also the virtual opportunities to make up days for excessive snow and fire challenges.
Thanks again for considering this chronic absenteeism and excessive absences. We really appreciate your good work.
Thank you. Next caller with the last four digits, 1064, you are now live. Please start your public comment.
Good morning. My name is Alejandra and I am part of an English learner advocacy group.
We are encouraged with staff assurance in March that the LP cut scores would be addressed in a future agenda,
but are concerned that it appears now that it will not be until September's meeting when the board is asked to make decisions on any cut scores.
We reiterate your strong concern that the current status performance level for English learner proficiency are inconsistent
with research finding that even English language learners with the lowest initial proficiency should be expected to reach reclassification within the five to seven years.
We ask for your support. Thank you. Thank you. And that was actually for the next item, item number three.
Oh, I'm sorry. Never mind. Just for any callers who are listening online.
And just a reminder, if you want to call in for an item that's not on the agenda, please call in for the general public comment item.
This is regarding item two. If you have a comment about another topic, please call in during general public comment. Thank you.
Next caller with the last four digits, 0493, you are now live. Please start your public comment.
Yes, I think the comments that were I'm sorry, board member board members and the department,
Shelly Spiegel, Coleman Californians together.
This item did have language at the beginning of it that said that the department and the board had reviewed with the technical design committee and the policy committee all the cut scores and were not making any adjustments.
So one of those priorities, one of those is the LP indicator.
So I think the LP indicator is appropriate for comments today because it is alluding to it in item two language.
So we are hoping that you will consider looking at the cut scores again. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Next caller, please. With the last four digits, 4966, you are now live. Please start your public comment.
Hello, Madam President and members of the board. My name is Veronica Medina, coordinator of people services at the San Ysidro School District.
How many percent of our students are in house?
I'm sorry, caller. We cannot hear you.
If you don't mind calling back in. Thank you.
Next caller with the last four digits, 0015, you're now live. Please start your public comment.
Call it. Hello, can you hear me? We can. Hello, can you? Oh, thank you so much. Hello, board president, Dr. Darlene Hammond, Vice Chair Woods, board members, Dr. Escobedo and Superintendent Thurman.
I'm Dr. Gina Potter, Superintendent for the San Ysidro School District located just north of Mexico.
Our district serves over 4500 students representing the most.
Sorry, representing some of the most vulnerable students in the state of California with 25% homeless, 60% English learners and 75% poverty.
Although we have a robust attendance support system with outreach consultants and I can't attendance network teams.
Our geographic region has remained a COVID epicenter in the state today. Variants disproportionately impact us.
Thus, having chronic absenteeism as a dashboard criteria has not been equitable or fair for our students.
We respectfully ask for the chronic absenteeism data on the dashboard to be information only with an LCAP addendum accompaniment.
We also seek an expansion of the Ed code for additional attendance recovery options, including participation in after school ACES and ELOP programs.
Thank you for your consideration and leadership. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

Hello, kids.
Okay. Good morning, President Dardenne-Hammond, students, board members, and Superintendent Thurmond.
My name is Applayeng Gutiaga, and I'm principal of Sunset Elementary School in the San Jacinto School District.
This past school year, Sunset's attendance team enacted attendance intervention and reduced chronic absenteeism by 18% from the previous school year, including relationships, building strategies that assist the students with socioeconomic issues.
However, the upcoming California dashboard will most likely continue to display our school as high or very high in chronic absenteeism, including our most vulnerable students.
As a former San Jacinto student myself, I know firsthand some of the challenges the students face to achieve educational success.
While our school believes in positive student attendance, the drastically diverse living circumstances of children throughout our state does not allow for a fair measure to be applied to all students regarding chronic absenteeism on the California dashboard.
As students and their families return to their normal lives after the devastating effects of the pandemic, I respectfully ask that you consider an empathetic and equitable attendance support system that encourages student engagement in school activities through a wide
variety of pathways matched to the needs of our most vulnerable students and families, such as students living in high-poverty neighborhoods where homelessness impacts about one in every four students. Thank you.
Thank you. Next caller with the last four digits, 5805.

Good morning, members of the board. My name is Vanessa Calderon, assistant principal and advocate of our multilingual learners students at Chano Island High School here in Ventura County.
The recent June 19, 2023 state board memo suggested that there is a standardized approach across indicators in setting the distribution of scores based on the prior performance of districts on a specific indicator.
The data shows significant variation across indicators. The cut point between very low and low performance ratings is an important one because it impacts many districts and subgroups receiving additional assistance through the system of support.
This leads us to asking for a review of the current ELPI status cut scores before the state board adapts them. Thank you for your support.
Thank you. Next caller with the last four digits, 2600. You are now live. Please start your public comment.
Good morning. I'm Tracy Chambers from San Bernardino County. On behalf of San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools and our 33 districts, we would like to express our sincere gratitude to the board for facilitating this crucial conversation on accountability related to crowding absenteeism.
As shared, the landscape has changed dramatically. This is of great significance to our districts as all of them in differentiated assistance are impacted by chronic absenteeism.
We believe the conversation around accountability on the dashboard is essential and we extend our appreciation to the department and the board for your willingness and dedication to readdress this issue. Thank you for your time.
Thank you. Next caller with the last four digits, 8744. You are now live. Please start your public comment.
Good morning, Dr. Darling-Hammond, board members. Diana Vu on behalf of the Association of Cal Poly School Administrators. We greatly appreciate the board's discussion and continued attention on chronic absenteeism and the different work done by the PDE and board staff to develop alternative policy considerations.
We fully believe in order to mitigate this negative impact it can have on students' academic performance and overall well-being, this challenge needs to be addressed.
Any policy change, however, should be considered to consider the potential trade-offs and unintended consequences that may arise. As such, no long-term changes to the chronic absenteeism indicators should be made without first bending to the proposals through CDE's technical design group, CPAC, and other education partners.
Additionally, we respectfully request the state continue statewide campaigns that showcase attendance as a key to wellness and educational achievement and provide local educational agencies with effective strategies and resources to combat chronic absenteeism. Thank you.
Thank you. Next caller with the last four digits, 1162. You are now live. Please start your public comment.
Good morning. Leticia Garcia, Riverside County Superintendent Schools, asks that you make no changes to the chronic absenteeism indicator at this time. Currently, 22 of our 23 school districts are identified for additional support due to chronic absenteeism, largely due to the pandemic and the public health orders that LEAs were required to follow.
Also, our education experts are working with our school districts and their attendance teams, both at school site level and district offices, to address chronic absenteeism. We are hosting the Chronic Absenteeism Institute to do a root cause analysis and develop strategies to address chronic absenteeism.
We ask that any discussion about changes to the indicator follow the same robust process that past indicators have gone through, vetting through CPAC, TDG, feedback from field experts, and allowing many opportunities for educational partners to provide input and for any potential changes to be included to the 2024 dashboard, not the 2023 dashboard. Thank you.
Thank you. Next caller with the last four digits, 8256. You are now live. Please start your public comment.
Hello, this is Robert Manoring, commenting on behalf of the Alliance for Student Success. We align our comments with CalTOG and its members around the LP standards and taking a closer look at that. In addition, in terms of chronic absenteeism, we would recommend that the board state the course on the current indicator.
Pursue option 2A that CDE staff put forward to modify the granularity of information, specifically around unexcused absences and policies around that. But more importantly, we would recommend that the board actually add an indicator for high school chronic absenteeism.
This is a chronic problem, particularly for your alternative ed schools, and we believe that the state should take a look at those indicators. To that end, we would recommend the board ask for an information memo on adding indicators to the state dashboard because we believe the issue is not high school chronic absenteeism, but how we meet federal requirements for accountability. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Next caller with the last four digits, 5596. You are now live. Please start your public comment.
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond and members. This is Liz Guiana, public advocates, lifting up the comments of the Equity Coalition. We support the board directing the department to pursue long-term option 2A, modify the granularity of info collected.
We agree it's important to expand the capacity of the department and our system to understand more precisely the different types of absences and to see how they vary across schools and districts.
On the short term modification options, we think it's too early to implement changes for the 23 dashboard. We agree with Hedy Chang that it is important to continue to track the extent of the loss of school days as we continue to emerge from the pandemic.
We feel it would be premature to alter the essential infrastructure of the indicator until there's a little more passage of time and more information on school attendance so that we can see if this year's significant spike is an anomaly or the new normal.
Our letter also asks that there be an info memo for the high school, for a high school chronic absence indicator. Thank you.
Thank you. Next caller with the last four digits, 5660. You are now live. Please start your public comment.
Good morning. This is Dave Gordon, the Sacramento County Superintendent of Schools. Right now, the chronic absenteeism indicator demands that seat time be the only metric used to measure whether adequate instructional time has been provided.
And the last few years have taught us that in real life circumstances intervene and conventional seat time is sometimes not an option for some young people and their families.
It's time to refine this indicator with an eye towards using what we've learned about top quality technology for delivery of instruction and measuring methods that provide for not just minimal, but optimal instructional time for all students. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Next caller with the last four digits, 9962. You are now live. Please start your public comment.
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond and members. This is Crystal Diaz who is helping us together. And we would like to ask the board for the draft of the five by five matrix for LPE be released at least one month prior to the September board meeting, allowing the opportunity for the field to review and provide feedback to staff. Seeing it one week prior to the SBE meeting adoption is not enough time to seriously understand and enter into a constructive conversation about the recommending structure and targets. Thank you.

Hi, my name is Bella Sharp. I'm a second year student at UCLA currently working as a children's movement equity fellow at Children Now. Similarly to how you are reflecting on the chronic absence indicator. And I'd like to comment on the standard setting process for English learners in California.
The board must reconsider how low the English language progress indicator standards are set because currently districts with high ELPI performance indicators are letting far too many students become long-term English learners.
As a student who attended an IB program within a standard public middle school, which had an English learner rate of 11%, I saw many kids at my school lose out on receiving the same level of education as me because of their status as a long-term English learner.
Low ELPI standards mean districts with EL programs that need support go underfunded. ELs will slip through the cracks if their districts are not properly identified as underperforming and given the resources they need to set goals and request funds that will get ELs back on track. Thank you.
Thank you. Next caller with the last four digits, 4301. You are now live. Please start your public comment.
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond, members of the board. This is Lindsay Tornatore calling on behalf of the California County Superintendent. We would like to express our very deep gratitude for the board and CDE compassion and awareness of the challenges our current system is facing related to chronic absenteeism.
With that, we want to also appreciate Vice President Glover-Woods' comments about the emphasis on educational partner input. We wholeheartedly agree. The robust and inclusive process the CDE has set up for all vetting of accountability policy changes always helps to ensure that the outcome helps to achieve the intended goal and is what is best for kids in schools. Thank you so much. We look forward to providing our input in this process.

Good morning. My name is John Malloy, and I'm the superintendent in the San Ramon Valley Unified School District, and I'd like to share that obviously attendance is so very important to all LEAs. I support that more precise look at the reason for why students might be absent.
I also would like to support Superintendent Gordon's insight regarding looking at the concept of seat time differently by going more deeply into the reasons for the absence. It then will allow us to understand strategies that can be utilized.
And my guess would be that some of those strategies would need other policy changes in order for us to implement them effectively. Also having different opportunities to support students who have been absent is also very, very key. Thank you again for your time and for everything that you do.
Thank you. Next caller with the last four digits, 5830. You are now live. Please start your public comment.
Good morning, Madam President, Superintendent Thurmond, members of the board. My name is Alan Yostarino, Superintendent of Schools for the Alvord Unified School District in Riverside County.
In my three decades as a school leader, chronic absenteeism has been a local indicator that I've relied on to identify and predict at Promise Youth and reallocate human educational and fiscal resources to meet their needs.
It's proven to be an effective early warning indicator of risk, particularly useful in identifying unique local conditions and student family circumstances.
The metric is particularly useful to identify demarcation points on a multi-tiered system support model, as well as serve as a foundation for policies and health-based practices.
However, it's then unexcused absences that are the most useful and accurate diagnostics, specifically related to predictability.
Excused absences, on the other hand, provide significantly less diagnostic utility, at least as a predictor.
As a research practitioner focused on strategic inquiry, I suggest the SBE consider a long-term approach and moving forward, modify the granularity of information collected around student absences for a more sharpened indicator.
Thank you.
And consider place when accounting for seat time. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

Good morning. Ruth Barajas from Californians Together.
In an equity-focused system, we should start with high expectations and build the system towards meeting those expectations.
Unfortunately, the distribution charts for very low LP do not take into account what we should expect from our students and the vast majority of districts.
After the board and the department agreed that growing one proficiency level a year is the expectation for all English learners,
it makes no sense that only districts with less than 35% of students making this progress would be considered very low and that high would be 55%.
We can and we should expect more for our students.
Thank you.
Thank you.

Hello. I'm Sally Fox representing the California Association for Bilingual Education, CABE, as education policy analyst.
I'm calling from San Diego where I started as a bilingual teacher and retired from the San Diego County Office of Education as a multilingual coordinator specializing in world languages, dual language, and English language development.
CABE signed on to the LCFF Equity Coalition in written public comment and concurs with previous callers, Children Now, and public advocates regarding chronic absenteeism.
As this is an update on the overall accountability system, we also concur with Californians together because their study last October, which reviewed districts with large numbers of ELs, found only 15% of the LCAPs had goals for ELs or ELV instruction.
CDE data show 41 districts identified for DA for ELs in the system of support in 2019 pre-pandemic and only 46 under the temporary criteria for 2022.
We believe LP standards' low expectations are the main cause of a lack of focus on ELs in goal setting, use of LCFF S&C funds, and external support. Thank you.
Thank you. Next caller with the last four digits, 4966. You are now live. Please start your public comment.
Good morning, Madam President and members of the board. My name is Veronica Medina, coordinator of people services at the San Jacinto School District.
For approximately 25% of our students are considered unhoused youth under the federal McKinney-Vento Act.
Our students grapple with generational poverty, homelessness, and equity issues, which makes life for our children and their families difficult.
Since the COVID pandemic, our students have suffered significant trauma due to extraordinarily high rates of positive COVID cases and fatalities.
Thanks to the State Board of Education's generous award of the community school grant to our district,
we have a wonderful opportunity to create an ecosystem of support to ensure children's needs are met with food, shelter, health care, vaccines, social-emotional services,
equitable access to technology and internet, and much more to improve student chronic absenteeism.
As the district's designated homeless liaison, I would love to offer virtual after-school programs such as tutoring during the week to recuperate student access.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Thank you. Next caller with the last four digits, 4612. You are now live. Please start your public comment.
Okay. It looks like that concludes public comment for item number two.
Thank you very much to all the members of the public who called in. And we're now open for board discussion about this item.
Thank you for coming to the podium, Cindy. I want to ask you, just before we get into further discussion,
it's my understanding that the five-by-five grids for the LP progress will be shared at the CPAC meeting in August, so they will be posted in advance of the meeting. Is that correct?
Absolutely. Absolutely.
So there will be plenty of time for people to have an opportunity to look.
There will be several weeks, if not closer to a month, for the public to weigh in on those five-by-five grids.
Thank you. So let me open up to the board for questions and discussion about what is the major part of the item on chronic absenteeism.
Yes. Member Escobedo? You're nodding, so I think you want to talk.
Yes, exactly. You know, I find option 1C and 2A tightly coupled.
If there's something I'd be looking at there, maybe you could call.
Sure. 2A being modified the granularity of information collected around student absences, and 1C is chronic absence student calculation methodology.
And I do believe that by modifying the granularity, that's going to inform how we're going to conduct the methodology for these calculations.
So, you know, hearing our speakers from different places is a complex problem.
And I know, you know, one of the slides says that chronic absenteeism indicator is instructional days that students are expected to attend, you know, however, is limited just to natural disasters.
And I know I've had students who were medically fragile, you know, and those are not captured, although they're not expected to attend because they have chronic illness.
And so I do believe, at least from my standpoint, that we need to have more granularity in the information that can inform how we calculate chronic absenteeism.
In addition to that, I also do believe we need to look at how can we capture attendance through other means.
We've heard some of our callers talking about online instruction and summer school instruction.
I think we really need to open that ability and how do we conduct this chronic absenteeism methodology in a different way.
So I really look forward to, you know, hearing more information and expanding how we calculate chronic absenteeism.
So for me, I would like to ponder upon, I would like to ask my colleagues, they're thinking about option C and 2A.
Others, yes. Member Yoshimoto-Tari?
And then Member Lewis, did I see your hand? Okay.
Thank you, Board President.
So I want to start by saying I'm sympathetic to the chronic absentee issue, both as a parent and a person who had COVID and had to stay out for a number of days, and my son did as well.
That being said, I'm also concerned of the short-term options that are represented today because they weren't able to go through the California practitioners group and the policy and the technical group to get that sort of feedback in time.
So, and I do see attendance as a symptom of other issues.
So I think getting to the root cause of attendance, whether transportation, whether it's work related, whether it's illness related, is important.
And for that reason, I would like to entertain 2A as a long-term solution to gather more data, but that also has impact on our local education agencies because it requires probably a change in the way that they're collecting data.
So I think it's important that we go through the stakeholder groups that I mentioned previously to get that type of feedback.
And like I said, there are other reasons. As a parent, every time I call our orthodontist office, which is every six weeks, I get an appointment.
My sons don't arrive home from school until 430, and the latest appointment is 330.
So in order to get their teeth straight, they have to get taken out of school early.
But the school isn't capturing that data necessarily at this point because they're not required to.
So I think that would be important to know. And possibly there's ways to change the hours so parents can get to appointments also without having to miss school.
That's it. I know that's a lot to go. That's outside of our limits to what we can do, our limits.
I know I'm just dreaming. But again, I think getting the stakeholder feedback is really important.
And the this idea of thinking about other ways of capturing attendance, especially now is is another place, I think, to go to the stakeholders and gather more input.
That's important. And then finally, I just want to bring us back to I recall there were a number of persuasive speakers at the last meeting around the California Distinguished School Awards.
And I know that's probably not the purview of the board. However, I think it's related to this item in that if my understanding is if an LEA is only identified for chronic absenteeism, that that doesn't qualify them for differentiated assistance, that needs to be two or more indicators.
And in that way, I think that at a time in our history where school districts worked so hard and needed morale boosts that perhaps if chronic absenteeism was the only indicator for the California Distinguished School Awards, that that could be something that could be revisited at some point.
And then finally, I'm glad to see on the five by five in the final row that something as little as a half a percent increase could qualify for orange and that there are at least three colors in that final band.
So a long story short, I think I would recommend staying the course in terms of 1A through C and then taking a look at 2A.
And I think that I just encourage people to think about short term, medium term, long term so that we are, you know, setting an agenda, you know, for not only September, but for the future, because this is a bigger problem than one that can be addressed in a very short period of time.
And I think that in the Distinguished School, just a clarification.
My understanding was that being in the low performance there was enough to keep people from being able to.
OK, yes, Cindy, you want to add?
I just wanted to highlight and I got to do this in my slides, but on page two of the attachment, we do highlight the fact that on data quest, which of course is not part of the dashboard.
There is a report called absence by reason, and that's where you will see the breakdown of students who were chronically absent either had unexcused absences, absence, excused absences.
Those those four four four bullet points.
One consideration the board could have as a short term that's not offered here is simply a link to those reports to highlight it in our resources under chronic to show that there is a disaggregation available.
Through a different a different source that the department publicly posts on an annual basis.
We've got member Lewis and then member Olken.
And then member Patillo Bronson.
OK, thank you, President Darlingham.
And if I could just ask a clarifying question based on what you just said about the link to the reports by reason, because I did see that.
How is that different or what impact does that have on option to a in modifying the granularity of info around absences?
Can you clarify the absolutely?
So I don't know if my slide is being shown on the screen.
This is the current definition.
And then we did talk through what the absences include.
These four types are what we publicly post option to a is to say you were excused.
Why were you even absent?
Were you absent because you had covid?
And those are things that we have not yet defined.
There is, of course, a lot of granularity there that involve health reasons that we need to be very sensitive to on the privacy piece.
We don't we don't actually for very good reasons include that kind of information in our student level data system.
And so these are conversations that we need to spend some serious time thinking through those definitions, those buckets that add another layer of granularity.
Maybe it's to a member of the point about you weren't able to get there because of a natural disaster or something that's affecting your particular family and not the school as a whole.
And the school didn't close.
So that that is that's the difference.
Does that make sense?
It does.
Thank you.
And that's what I was thinking.
But I just wanted to clarify.
Thank you very much.
I just want to say that I do agree with my colleagues that have spoken so far about a short time frame that we have to do any type of short term changes and as to complement or comment on member Escobedo's question about option two and how we're feeling about that.
That's kind of where I see an interest in maybe modifying the granularity of information around the absences.
I think the reasons for absences are important.
You know, as districts try to be just strategic.
Thank you.
Too much coffee.
Strategic around addressing student issues as to why their absence.
It's a little different if you know they gave a very good example in one of the reports about a student who's absent for five days because of illness and another student one student had access to go to a doctor and another student didn't.
So therefore that one student with five days of absence for illness couldn't get their absence excuse.
So I think it's really important because as school districts work on all these strategies to address student needs, I think, and especially coupled with the community school initiatives, I think that's important that they have that information to really know how to begin to really address those specific needs of students.
I think it's important that all absences are reported because no matter as it's been said in the agenda item and with the callers, no matter what the reason a student is absent, you really want to zero in on that and provide assistance where necessary because it affects so many other things.
It affects grades in your class.
It affects truancy.
It affects graduation, all of those things.
If you've failing classes because you're out of class and you're not able to make up the work.
So I would I'm interested in more information around option to a as was mentioned by some of the districts.
Whatever option is chosen, we need to be able to look at what unintended consequences there are that we may not be thinking of at this point.
And I think I think that's all I have in my notes right now, but I think that would be that's an option that I would like more information on.
And again, as already been mentioned, it's very important that all of these options are vetted.
Like you said, there hasn't been time to vet any of those, but I believe that that's really important and would like to see more information about option to as a long term.
Member open and then we have member Patel O'Bronson.
Is there anybody else who wants to get into the queue?
Member McQuillin.
All right.
And vice president.
Okay.
Thank you.
First, I just want to thank you and your team, Cindy, for bringing such a variety of options to us, because for me, it helps underscore that there are lots of different ways we can get to achieving goals, achieving our goals for ourselves.
Achieving our goals for our students and that data support and accountability will all follow from how we go about it.
Right.
So I really appreciate the way you thought through this item.
And it it made me think a little bit about the conversations we had a while back about the principles behind the dashboard.
So what's the point of the dashboard when we're when we're thinking about making changes to it?
And certainly, you know, key among them is this idea that we need to in order to understand the success and challenges of our schools, we have to look at multiple measures.
And I think that's why this chronic absenteeism measure is so important.
And as somebody who works at the school level, I can say I have we have never seen such high levels of absentee of absent students as we have since we returned.
I mean, it's it's truly like not only does the you know, our attendance reports show it, our our funding shows it, our grades show it.
And you can just feel it in the schools.
Right. Kids are absent at a level that they haven't been in the past.
And in talking with colleagues at other schools, everybody is seeing it.
Right. So this is this is I think why it's important that we're talking about this.
And so then getting back to the dashboard principles for me, you know, the one of the major intents of the dashboard is to identify schools where there's need for support.
And if all schools or a very high percentage of schools are being flagged as needing support in this item, I mean, on this indicator, it's hard to know how to support them.
Right. And so back to President Darling Hammond's sort of asking us to think short term and long term, it makes me really care about the short term.
If there's such if there is a way that is feasible, wanting to I think it makes sense to try and make a change that will highlight schools where there really is need for support because so many students are not getting to school.
There are just such implications and ramifications for kids when that happens.
So that's a super long preamble to a question for you, which is my understanding is that the first type of recommendation is that we would adjust the cut scores for.
Am I already wrong?
Am I already wrong?
My my my so is that we could potentially adjust the cut scores for when schools are
in the in the red.
Okay. And I just want to add one more preamble. Sorry. Also, I recognize that the point you made in the item about having the change indicator could really provide the type of change that I'm hoping to see.
Right. So that's because that, you know, last year that last dashboard, all we had was the one year information which showed drastic numbers of students out.
And hopefully, even if it's coming back slowly, kids are returning to school with more regularity.
So I just want to put that out there that perhaps there already is some change based on having change that change status.
Okay. But with that, yeah, with that, my question is, what is the typical process by which we would change cut scores?
Because if we are so so if we were going to in September, approve a different change, a different cut score, would we be doing something drastically different than normal in doing that?
Or are we still within the time frame where we could still get the type of feedback and vetting that is typical?
I'll take the last part of the question and I'm going to turn it over to Kim and she'll introduce herself and her role.
So, it is a very truncated feedback loop. You already heard from a whole group of individuals who are very eager to hear about what we're going to be doing in September.
So that that particular item we've been working on for years.
This is one that we are working on, you know, as of the May board meeting.
So we do have a couple of touch points.
The other thing is our normal groups are on vacation.
They're not they're not they're not meeting.
And so we have reached out to the county superintendents organization to help us get some feedback from their membership before CPAC, which is towards the end of August.
CPAC is really those one of the critical bodies, as I already mentioned, that advises you.
We will have a technical design group meeting prior to that as well.
And then, you know, if there's if there's other groups we should be reaching out to, we can try.
But those are those are the touch points in which we would go for public input ahead of coming to you the second week of September.
So, again, we have not done any data processing in it to establish these cut points.
And Kim can definitely talk about historically how would this fit in to things.
But it is truncated.
Good morning, Kimberly Muntank, administrator of the Accountability Development and Policy Analysis Unit and AMR under Cindy.
So if we were to look at changing cut points right for status, we would be looking at a historical set of data that we have available to us from twenty seventeen, twenty eighteen, twenty nineteen and two thousand twenty one.
So that is the set of data that we have available to us, obviously.
And this is available to you to look at in the memo that we shared in June.
We actually set across all of those.
You can look and see the actual variation across status for the chronic absenteeism indicator and see what that status looks like and see a very obvious and dramatic difference in the two thousand twenty one cut scores.
So what we would be looking at is speaking to our partners right and speaking to the public around where would you feel comfortable as to setting a cut score right for that very low category or very high category and then all of the proceeding cut scores in between to be able to reflect the historical patterns of status.
And so that unlike any other cut score we've set right.
We have a huge anomaly year and that would need to be incorporated into what we do with the cut score.
So as Cindy said, we will not have any present year information to counteract what we saw last year for two thousand twenty two.
It's not going to be there.
So we would be looking at a disparate set of data across very common data and then an anomaly year and it would be up to you to decide where those points would go.
If just to follow up.
Thank you. That was super helpful.
Just to follow up.
If we were to do that, recognizing part of the point, I think, is that we do have a huge anomaly.
Right.
Like that that schools are being their their their measure on this indicator is being based on something that is very different than we've seen in the past.
Right. And so if we were to change, we were to incorporate the anomalous year into it, it would somewhat counteract.
It would take into account the fact that times are different than they were in the past.
It will look at incorporating last year's right.
The pattern of chronic absenteeism that we saw and incorporate that into the dashboard moving forward for all future years as well.
So that would be a you know, a change moving forward, because again, we're approaching a new L cap cycle.
Folks will be setting goals and looking at colors and seeing where they would like to, you know, what goal they feel like they, you know, performance levels they can achieve.
So they'll be utilizing those five by five performance levels and the status cut points to predict their performance and set their high high goals for where they'd like to move to.
So that new new set chart would be a part of that process.
So either we would use the chart that doesn't take into account the anomalous year for all years moving forward, or we would use one that does.
That would be the decision moving forward.
Now, I just want to clarify, either way, we're providing something that is going to we're going to use for all years moving all years moving forward.
That's correct. Thank you so much.
The past year is already in the data, right?
I just want to clarify one thing, too, that, you know, the the chronic absenteeism rates were so high for so many districts that in the current grid, which moves people along almost, I would think most places will show improvement.
Right. And so, you know, there's there's one of the options that has to do with, you know, how many red how many places should there be red colors on the grid?
But but most places will show improvement.
I think the bigger picture is what are we looking at going forward in an in a world in which, you know, both health issues continue to be challenging and climate issues continue to be challenging.
And how do we want to help focus in on the right kind of interventions to support getting kids to school when it's safe for them to be there and also supporting districts in that process and then also helping people know what's going on so that they can make good decisions.
So I think, you know, the the question about this year and next year is is even if almost all the districts move up on the, you know, get have lower chronic absenteeism than they did last year.
We still will have questions about how do we think about the future because we have to start to see what the new normal is.
If there is a new normal.
I'm sorry to go on at life, but go ahead, Cindy. You might have wanted to chime in on something there.
Was there then a preference on any of those or.
It sounded like they were just clarifying questions. Yeah, thank you.
I was just clarifying and and then and thanks for bringing me back up because I forgot to say one more thing, which is at the school level and even at the district level.
We we do have there are ways to understand why students are absent.
So it's not just at the state level where we are doing the work to understand why students are absent and what types of interventions will support them.
And I think that's an important thing just to mention as well.
And that may be part of this question of what kind of granularity makes sense.
Just to flag for folks on the climate front or for that matter, even on the health front, you know, we have this other process, which is separate from Cindy's division called the J 13 waiver, which is something that districts can apply for.
If they've had to close schools because of, you know, Kobe or if they've had to close school because of fire or, you know, flood or, you know, any of the other things that we see so many more of.
So so those days don't actually get counted in chronic absenteeism and they don't get counted against their attendance for financial reasons.
What is not currently done there, however, is figuring out when kids can't when the school is open, but kids cannot come to school because, you know, of health reasons or because, you know, the roads are impassable because, you know, snow or flood or whatever.
That is currently not part of that process.
But one could think about is there a procedure by which independent of the chronic absenteeism, you know, metric, one could begin to understand those things because they're often matters of public record.
So, yeah, there's a lot of things we may want to explore, both at the school level and at the county or state level.
I think the next person was member Patel O'Bronson.
You covered largely the point I just wanted to raise.
There was a panel back in April that was about climate resilient schools looking at both school closures as sort of the first order of impact that impacts student learning and attendance, but also even if a school, which is oftentimes built to the highest level of code in terms of.
Well, certainly, at least earthquake readiness oftentimes is it is a more resilient place, but where families are actually facing flooded homes on possible roads.
We know that from earlier this year it was 85,000 students who had not attended schools as of March.
So that was like a quarter of the school year rather than the point we're at right now.
And I would, I would put that in the category of unfortunately predictable types of absences that we should be prepared for in the future.
Hopefully, knock on wood, COVID will be a once in a century unusual event that we won't see those types of chronic absenteeism of that order of magnitude in the future.
But I think we should be prepared for climate impacts in ways that suggest knowing and having greater granularity as to the reasons why students miss school will be really helpful in informing the types of interventions that we look for from schools.
The last thing that I just want to flag on the granularity, the 2A endorsement is that there's also very different absenteeism patterns based on grade level.
So in LA County, kindergarten absenteeism and ninth grade absenteeism are the highest for very different reasons around school sort of attendance habits on the part of families for young children around early sicknesses because kids are building up their immune systems versus ninth grade is where truancy sort of actually makes a whole different appearance and is not so prevalent a phenomena among five and four year olds.
But thinking about how to disaggregate the reasons, I think, would give a lot better of information to think about which interventions would be most impactful.
Member McClellan.
Thank you. Thank you for this very rich conversation.
I don't want to repeat, but the granularity, I think, also needs to be looked at very closely.
We don't have a lot of time to do that in two months, but, you know, those levels of poverty, those could be drawn out of whether it's transportation or caring for siblings or some other form of poverty that could be causing that chronic absenteeism.
Also considering privacy in that also, or if for some of our communities, those disasters on related to weather or COVID also did play a major part.
That's very different, different.
Hopefully, we will never have to experience that again and in the short run.
I also appreciate what Francisco said about in this process, finding that flexibility for students to recover in different ways, how to get credit, how to get other alternative learning done, should be a part of this conversation also, where kids can get credit for community learning and doing things with their families, that kind of thing.
Thank you.
Vice President Glover Woods and then member Roscoe Gonzalez.
Member Yoshimoto-Towry, did you just fly here? Okay, we'll come back around to you.
And is there anyone else? All right.
Vice President Glover Woods.
So I think, and again, I appreciate the robust conversation and the public comment and all of that good stuff.
As we were listening to the public comments, I think one thing we can say that we did not hear is to keep the status quo indefinitely.
So kind of going back to the recommendation that was presented in front of us, for 2023, it seems that things need to pretty much stay as they are.
And I do appreciate, Cindy, that thought of having the link to the more disaggregated attendance data as part of the dashboard for 2023.
I think that can be helpful. And I would say, just as an aside, that there's so much rich data on DataQuest that it may be helpful to take a look at what type of links should go on the dashboard in relation to those different indicators so that those who need to and want to take a deeper dive into the disaggregated data has a way to just one click, boom, jump right into DataQuest to that data.
As we go forward, I just want to underscore something I said in my earlier comments, which is for 2024, it's important, in my humble opinion, to explore all of the things that have come up in this conversation, exploring what will it look like if we looked at the granularity of the data that's collected around absences.
Is there anything that we need to look at regarding the methodology? All of those pieces, those are really important points to start to look at as we look forward to the 2024 dashboard.
And again, that convening of CPAG and the technical design group and then the feedback, again, from all of the schools and the districts and whatnot, all need to come in play with that.
And since we're at the beginning of a school year, this might be a really great way to ensure that that conversation is interwoven, if you will, with the agendas and the conversations that will take place with those particular groups.
Looking forward, I don't know if it's 2024, even 2024 and beyond, that whole idea of, well, how might we recover for students that are not able to be in seat, but yet and still receive rigorous instruction?
And what does that look like? What are the pros to that? What are the consequences to that? Those are conversations also that I would encourage to take place moving forward.
And I'll say in closing, as we were having conversations about really recovery or credit for not being in seat, my first reaction was, you know, and for a while it's been like, oh my gosh, no, kids have to be there every day.
What are we talking about? You know, let's not even go down that particular road. I also recognize that we're in a different space and place.
So I don't want to be misunderstood to say that I don't feel that students should be in school and in class, but I also realize that there are other ways that students can receive rigorous instruction that allows for them to master standards without that in seat.
Just as we back in the day, the only banking you could do was to go into the bank. You were doing no transactions financially without physically walking into a bank.
These days, you can even deposit a check from where you're sitting right now. So things have indeed changed, and I think it's important for us to explore those changes.
Again, look at what are the benefits. Also look at what are the consequences and what might be the unintended consequences as we move forward.
And I have member Roscoe Gonzalez, I think, next, and then back to member Yoshimoto Tauri. Oh, and then member Rodriguez.
Thank you. I don't want to repeat. Actually, Vice President Glover Woods, you actually touched on a few points that you talked about the dashboard, so I won't repeat some of those.
I just wanted to say that it's evident that tackling the issue requires a comprehensive approach that takes into account multiple factors in contributing to student absences.
So regarding the option to modifying the granularity of information collected around student absences, I would like to dive a delve deeper into the topic exploring the possibility of including additional reporting details specifically related to unexcused absences.
As a teacher working in an urban school setting, I have observed that some parents lack access to health care, which was touched on by Yoshimoto Tauri.
The transportation and the face challenges in adequate health care, these circumstances often hinder students from attending school regularly.
So therefore, I believe it's crucial to provide the necessary support systems to assist these students and their families in overcoming these barriers and ensuring consistent attendance.
So I think exploring ways, creative ways for attendance recovery, such as virtual opportunities, I know that that would be something that I'd like to explore.
Thank you. Right. I think we're going to member Yoshimoto Tauri, and then we're going to come back to member Rodriguez.
Now we're going to move forward. I just wanted to amend the record because after I spoke last, you mentioned the link.
So I wanted to say I would be supportive of having the link.
And then I just I remembered something about the flexibility and the online instruction that we faced during the pandemic that I wanted to go on record with, which is if we explore ways to count attendance in flexible ways.
We also have to explore ways that we can record that in ways that's not prohibitive for teachers to keep track of.
There was a lot of paperwork involved with the master agreement and the record of instruction that the teachers were doing.
So I think I wanted to go on record to say that I would be interested in finding out other ways, streamlining that. Thank you.
Thank you. Member Rodriguez. Thank you.
I won't repeat all of the great things that have been said, but I mean, I concur with the granularity, especially and being a little creative.
And thank you so much, Cindy, for bringing this to us, and especially in such a short time frame as a high school teacher.
I agree that the reasons are different for students being absent when they're little and when they're in high school.
And so much of it in my observation is social emotional foster students who are really struggling, sometimes finding a home.
And this information, much like assessments, schools can use it right the way we use assessments in the classroom to guide our students.
We can use this information to see how we can help our students with mental health supports, the social emotional learning and offering alternative opportunities for learning,
as was suggested the after school. And, you know, I know that the reasons for absences for a lot of our students would just break our hearts if we started listening to them right now.
So there's a there's a human component to the numbers.
And I'm very optimistic about community schools, because I think that there are some great scaffolds and props for the whole community when it comes to attendance and chronic absenteeism as a solution.
Thank you.
Well, thanks for this really wonderful conversation. I hear a lot about the granularity of data, some of which is going to be appropriate to collect and understand and think about at the local school level.
And then we have to think about what's going to be appropriate at the state level without creating a huge kind of, you know, burden on schools or getting into all the rationale.
But I think that we've got a consensus that we want a deliberative approach to this.
We recognize that there are challenges right now with this indicator.
We'll need time to sort out what the right measures and steps may be.
And there's a lot of interest then in getting to at least the granularity at the state level around things that might include acts of God that are, you know, beyond the micro level issues.
And again, thanks to Cindy for bringing this to us.
I think one of our questions as we move forward, we'll ask for some data in September or November, depending on when it arrives.
So I think I heard that there would not be data in September yet about 20 to 23 patterns, but we could ask to look at that in November and look at the question of this.
You know, has it changed much? Like, where are we in this in this new normal?
And it doesn't make sense to set new standards if you haven't seen the new data necessarily.
But I do think we will want to be able in September to understand what the way the dashboard operates now might make sure everybody understands how it would produce its results in the short term.
And, you know, if we do see that there are very different norms, we could think about the kind of suggestion that Hedy Tang made when she called in that we think about re-benching.
But I don't think that this is the moment necessarily yet to do that.
We do, I think, have some agreement about how to think about some of the big issues moving forward.
And just to kind of put a pin in that, you know, what we do when we set dashboard indicators is we create incentives.
One of the incentives we want to create here is to have districts look carefully at what's going on when a lot of kids are absent and figure out what the reasons are, whether it is foster care,
or whether it is, you know, homelessness, or whether it's, you know, any number of things, and then try to find solutions, you know, to those things.
And we've been doing more and more at the state to support the kind of solutions that might be helpful with community schools and mental health services and health services and so on.
What we don't want to do is get to a place where the indicator creates incentives that are inappropriate.
I've heard of policies in some districts, because they've been worried about this, to fail students if they're absent for any reason for more than eight days or something like that.
And when that happens, and I have a daughter who's medically fragile, you know, you're then asking people to come to school sick or to come to school and expose themselves to others who are sick if they're in a, you know,
immune compromised place or to get on roads that are full of snow or ice or whatever may be going on.
So we don't want to get to a place where the indicator is creating an incentive structure that causes people to do things that are unsafe for children.
But there are lots of ways to address those things beyond the indicator itself.
You know, one of them would be to allow for makeup days, which is, you know, sort of a separate issue.
Another would be to become more flexible in that independent study approach so that people could be online,
so that a medically compromised student could, you know, zoom in or get their assignments or, you know, have a system by which they could continue to keep up.
So I think we want to think about many of those kinds of things, which are not about the indicator itself so much as it is about the ways in which people can be in attendance and, you know,
demonstrate that the incentives are encouraging people to keep learning.
I love your bank metaphor. That was a really good one.
So those are things that I think we can also begin to look at, and those are not necessarily part of the accountability dashboard per se, but they are adjuncts to it.
So I think that'll be some of our work over the coming year in addition to seeing what we can understand appropriately about granularity that we've begun to think about at this point.
And I think one of the key points that was made in many people's comments is that root cause analysis is at the core of the rationale for this indicator.
So what we'll need to understand is what can we do to support both the root cause analysis, but also the engagement of students in school and ways that work under what will be changing circumstances.
And with that, I think we've given you a lot to chew on, but you may have some questions.
The link to the data question.
Yes, and I think that that's been reiterated many times, and that will give people at least four categories of more granular data that they can be looking at.
President Donahamn, can I just, without emotion, can I just make sure that I understand what is being asked of the department for September and beyond.
What I heard from member McClellan, among others, member Glover-Woods, is an interest in raising up the absence by reason reports, which are currently on our dashboard as a way to show, we like to call this little a accountability, transparency, greater detail into the data, potentially doing some resources around that.
On other indicators as well, where we see information that's not captured on the dashboard, like potentially grade level information around chronic absenteeism, for example.
And then we, the meetings for September and November, I'm not sure will allow us to be able to give you a preview of the data that will be publicly available by December 15th, but we will do our best to obviously work with your staff to see what's feasible for that.
And then we will absolutely explore option 2A a bit more.
We have not had a conversation with our colleagues who actually run the data system and, of course, others like Department of Finance, because that would be adding a level of granularity that this system doesn't have right now.
And so we want to make sure that we do this very thoughtfully, but we can definitely update you along the way.
And if anything, we would incorporate that into our work plan for 2024.
Is that?
I think that pretty much covers it.
Thank you.
Thank you for listening so carefully.
And with that, I'm going to give us a 10 minute break.
So we will see you at 10.
1041.
Okay.
Welcome back.
I'd like to reconvene the board and resume item three, which is the California assessment of student performance and progress and the English language proficiency assessments for California.
Update on program activities.
This is an information item, so no particular action is recommended at this time, and it will be presented by Cheryl Cotton.
Welcome and Mal Vang of the CDE.
Good morning, Superintendent Thurman, President Darling-Hammond, Vice President Glover-Woods, board members.
I'm Cheryl Cotton, Deputy Superintendent of our Instruction Measurement and Administration Branch here at the California Department of Education.
To assist with this item, as Dr. Darling-Hammond stated, Mal Vang is here as well as Marianne Arcilla.
She is the executive director for K-12 student assessments at the Educational Testing Service.
The item before you today is an information item.
Let me get situated.
Okay.
Today's presentation will cover assessment updates, which includes the national and international assessments, as well as the California assessment of student performance and progress, or the CASP, and the English language proficiency assessments for California, the LPAC.
The CASP and LPAC topics covered today will include the schedule for the availability of the 2022-23 test results to local education agencies.
The available training sessions for the California Educator Reporting System, or CSRS.
The updates to the interim assessments and tools for teachers resources.
Mal is going to provide us with findings from the initial alternate LPAC threshold score validation study.
She'll also provide an update to the department submission of the federal peer review.
And finally, Marianne from ETS will give an update on the student score report redesign effort and provide an opportunity for the board to discuss and provide feedback to the redesigned student score reports.
We've been talking about that for a long time.
I'm looking forward to that conversation.
We plan to take the feedback provided during today's discussion to revise the 23-24 student score report designs and bring the proposed student score reports back to the board in September.
The national and international assessments in which California schools participated this past school year include the following.
The National Assessment for Educational Progress, or the NAEP, also known as the nation's report card.
They conducted their age 13 long-term trend assessment last fall and a field test study this spring.
The International Computer and Information Literacy Study, or ICILS.
The Program for International Student Assessments, PISA, and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, or the TEMS.
This slide shows a brief overview of all four of these assessments.
This slide shows a brief overview of all four of these assessment programs for the 22-23 school year.
For the NAEP, the NAEP is the largest nationally representative and continuing assessment of what U.S. students know and can do in various subjects.
It was mandated by Congress in 1969.
For 22-23, NAEP conducted two different assessment programs, the NAEP Long-Term Trend, or LTT, and a field test for main NAEP.
The NAEP LTT is an age-based, paper-based, and has been administered in the same way since 1971 for reading and 1973 for math.
Results are reported for the nation only.
In contrast, the main NAEP has been conducted since the early 1990s, is now administered digitally on tablets,
and can give us national, state, and tribal urban district assessment, or TUDA, results.
In the fall of 2022, NAEP conducted the age 13 LTT mathematics and reading assessments.
Students from 57 California schools participated in the NAEP LTT.
For ICILS, that was administered in April of 2023.
That drew students from over 30 countries, and that included 19 California public schools.
For the PISA, that assessment was administered in April of 2023, and the PISA administered assessments to students in over 80 countries,
and that included 16 California public schools.
And the TIMS, in spring of 2023, administered to students in more than 65 countries, and included 48 California schools.
Now I want to transition to the CASP and LPAC assessments results and their availability to local education agencies.
After completing the quality control check, the student score reports became available to LEAs.
Corresponding student results are also delivered to the California Educator Reporting System, or CSRS, where they can be accessed by educators.
Student score report release dates for the CASP and LPAC are as follows.
On May 11, 2023, the SSRs were first released for the summit of LPAC in grades 3 through 12.
On May 31, 2023, the SSRs were first released to the summit of LPAC, kindergarten, through grade 2.
And on June 1, 2023, the SSRs were released for the Smarter Balanced Summit of Assessment for English Language, Arts, and Literacy, or ELA,
and Mathematics, as well as the California Science Test, or CAST.
Due to the post-equating of some assessments, which requires the full set of student results before releasing individual student scores,
some SSRs will be released in August and September.
SSRs for the summative alternate LPAC are scheduled for release in August of 2023,
and SSRs for the California Spanish Assessment, California Alternate Assessments for ELA, Mathematics, and Science
are scheduled to be released to ELAs in September of 2023.
The CDE recommends that ELAs use the data within SSRs for local planning purposes.
And now I'd like to transition to the available trainings for the California Educator Reporting System against SSRs.
SSRs provides LEA staff with early access to individual and aggregate student results from CAST and LPAC summative assessments,
as well as from Smarter Balanced interim assessments.
Only SSRs training sessions will be offered through the 23-24 school year.
For the summer and fall 2023 training sessions, two distinct sessions will be offered.
One is an introduction.
Could you make sure your mic is on?
It sounded like it was...
No, that's better. I think you just need to be closer to it maybe.
Better?
Thank you.
Thank you.
There are two distinct sessions that are being offered for SSRs.
One is the introduction to SSRs for coordinators and administrators,
and that's a session for staff who are responsible for managing the LEA's use of SSRs,
such as those who have an LEA or site coordinator role in the Test Operations Management System, or TOMS.
And then also the introduction to SSRs for teachers, which is for staff who access SSRs data, such as classroom teachers.
And so those are some of the trainings that are coming up for SSRs.
And as we look at interim assessments, interim assessments are an optional component for the California assessment system.
Interim assessments are available to LEA's year-round and provide meaningful information to guide instruction and support student learning.
During the 2022-23 school year, more than 7 million Smarter Balanced Interim Assessments for ELA and Mathematics were completed across more than 1,600 LEAs.
That's good information.
These numbers exceed those for the 2021-22 school year, during which nearly 6 million interim assessments were completed across nearly 1,600 LEAs.
The 2023-24 Smarter Balanced Interim Assessments for ELA and Mathematics will become available to LEA's on August 1, 2023.
More than 100 interim assessments forms will be available for ELA, as well as more than 100 forms for Mathematics.
While no test forms will be part of this release, there will be some test item substitutions on a small percentage of these test forms.
By September of 2023, the CAST and LPAC interim assessments will join the Smarter Balanced Interim Assessments for ELA and Mathematics as the CDE launches the first set of CAST and LPAC interim assessments.
Also, please be aware that to support teachers in using the formative assessment process in the classroom, instructional resources continue to be developed by educators for inclusion on the Tools for Teachers website.
With that, I will hand the mic over to Dr. Mao Vang.
She is going to be presenting on two additional topics.
Thank you, everyone.
Thank you, Cheryl.
Chief Deputy Nicely, President Donnelly-Hammond, Vice President Glover-Woods, and esteemed board members, I'm Mao Vang.
I'm the Director for the Assessment Development and Administration Division at the California Department of Education.
To provide additional validity evidence for the initial alternate LPAC threshold scores that were approved by the State Board of Education in May 2022, ETS, our assessment contractor, conducted the study using a contrasting group methodology,
where facilitators asked California educators to evaluate the degree to which they agree with the results of the initial alternate LPAC based on the general performance level descriptors, which were used to define the threshold scores.
Results from the first operational initial alternate LPAC from July 2022 through January 2023 were used to conduct the study.
The study gathered information, again, about the extent to which the California educators who had kindergarten and first grade students who took the initial alternate LPAC agreed that their students were correctly classified as English learner or EL or initial fluent English proficient or IFEP.
So the sample consists of educators from more than 100 local educational agencies, and they provided individual ratings for more than 400 students.
The results indicated that for the bulk of the students who are in kindergarteners, 83% of educators indicated they either agreed or strongly agreed with the EL classification designated by the initial alternate LPAC, and 95% of the educators indicated that they either agreed or strongly agreed with the students' classification as IFEP or initial fluent English proficient.
So based on these high percentage of agreement by the educators, the initial alternate LPAC threshold scores will be maintained, and these similar studies such as this support our peer review process, of which I will discuss next.
The federal peer review update in this section is a process that California goes through.
I will share that we are submitting peer review for the California Alternate Assessments or CAAs for English Language Arts and Mathematics, the California Science Test or CAST, and the California Alternate Assessment for Science, the English Language Proficiency Assessment for California, which is the summative LPAC, and then the summative alternate LPAC.
California's assessments are required to undergo this federal peer review process, and the CDE submits them to the U.S. Department of Education.
Various documents demonstrating that California's assessments for English Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, and English Language Proficiency meet the federal requirements for validity, reliability, and fairness, which was established for states to abide by the Every Student Succeeds Act or ESSA.
So peer review is often an iterative process, which states submitting additional evidence to meet the requirements as the evidence become available.
So in June the CDE submitted evidence to support the peer review for multiple assessments, and I'll provide a quick overview of that.
There are seven critical elements that describe the federal requirements for building and administering assessments that are valid and reliable.
California must submit evidence in support of each of these elements and their subcategories, if applicable.
The first are California Alternate Assessments for English Language Arts and Mathematics.
The first submission of these documents occurred in 2018.
As I mentioned, it's an iterative process.
We had 148 evidentiary documents.
Based on that initial submission, California received a status that substantially meets the requirements, indicating that the majority of the critical elements were addressed with only minimal additional evidence needed.
We have submitted additional evidence as it has become available that were included in the June submission to fulfill any outstanding requirements.
And then for the science peer review submission, the CAST was first administered in 2018-19 and was submitted for peer review in 2022, and it received a status that substantially meets also.
In June, we submitted an additional 25 additional evidentiary documents for the CAST to fulfill any remaining evidence that was needed.
And then for the CA for Science, we submitted over 200 documents for its first submission in June based on that first operational administration in the 2021-22 school year.
Moving on to the LPAC, the English Language Proficiency Assessments, peer review submission.
This is the summative LPAC.
These assessments also received substantially meets requirements in 2022.
In June 23, we submitted 30 additional documents to fulfill the outstanding requirements.
We completed the first submission of our summative alternate LPAC in June 2023 also with 260 evidentiary documents.
This was based on that first operational administration that occurred in 2021-22.
The CDE will provide updates on the outcomes of these submissions and reviews as they become available, and we'll share them with you in future meetings.
And with that, I will hand the presentation over to Marianne Arcella from ETS to present the Student Score Report Redesign.
Thank you, Mel.
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond, Vice President Glover-Woods, Chief Deputy Nicely, Distinguished Board Members, Executive Director of Board Staff, and Distinguished Leaders and Staff of the Department.
I'm Marianne Arcella, Executive Director at ETS for our K-12 assessments.
It's an honor to participate in the work that we are conducting in support of the California assessment system.
Today, I'm pleased to present to you information about the CASM and LPAC Student Score Report Redesign effort.
In 2015-16, when California moved from the paper pencil test, which was the STAR program, to the current online test, the department and the board introduced a new Student Score Report to go along with the new online assessments.
At the time, the Student Score Reports focused on English Language Arts Literacy, or ELA, and mathematics.
These were the first online tests that rolled out under CASM.
Over the years, California added assessments as part of the California assessment system, which included both CASM and LPAC tests.
As each new test was launched, California developed and incorporated new Student Score Reports.
The first reports for each test may have included introductory information, such as percent correct, as the department and the ETS team conducted standard setting and other validation work.
The Student Score Reports were also adjusted as needed to meet the needs of the state, such as when the Smarter Balanced, ELA, and Mathematics adjusted test blueprints were adopted, and we made some changes to the format.
So why are we redesigning the Student Score Reports now?
So one of the big things is that beginning in the 2023-24 administration, this will be the first year in which all CASM and LPAC tests are now operational.
So we have the opportunity to incorporate research findings, best practices, feedback along the way into the reports to help improve readability and engagement.
We also have the opportunity to set up the reports in such a way that provides flexibility for future novel approaches of delivery.
At the start of the redesign effort, the department and ETS worked to establish the overall goals of the redesign.
The goals, as stated here, are to improve the reporting of test results provided to students, parents, and guardians and include actionable information.
We also, one of the other goals is to provide students, parents, and guardians with timely access to test results while minimizing distribution efforts for LEAs, local education agencies.
In addition, we kept in mind additional considerations for the redesign, such as being device agnostic, interactive, flexible to accommodate changes, printable, and to make sure that there was increasing accessibility.
We also considered new ways to provide additional resources to parents and guardians without adding content to the Student Score Reports.
For example, over the past three years, there's more acceptance and also the technology to receive information in real time and in progressive manner.
There's also more acceptance to receive information in different formats than before, such as through parent portals or with supporting video should California provide to use these options in the future.
In other words, we wanted to future proof the solution as much as possible.
In September, beginning in September through November 2022, during the initial concept design, we conducted feedback sessions with interest holders, including at the annual conferences for the California Educational Research Association, CDE's own California Assessment Conference, and the annual conference for the California IT and Education, or CITE, to gather information on current Student Score Reports.
During these sessions, the participants were asked what they liked and what they disliked about the current score reports and what they would like to see in the redesign effort.
The information from that feedback session from those feedback sessions were used in the design of the original mockups, which were then shared with focus groups.
We enlisted a market research company to conduct five focus group sessions in December 2022 and earlier this year in January 2023.
Two were with parents and guardians, one of those which which was with a Spanish speaking set of parents and guardians, one with students, one with teachers, and one with interest holders.
ETS and CDE members were invited to observe the focus groups, so we were able to listen in on the comments, but we were not actually asking the questions.
Someone else was doing that.
From February through June 2023, the mockups were revised during an interactive review process with the CDE.
During this time, we also received additional feedback from the CASP and LPAC technical advisory group, the assessment interest holders, and the regional assessment network.
On the next two slides that I'll move to, I'll show you a sample of the conceptual designs that were presented to the focus groups.
And they were presented to the focus groups for their reaction and input.
One set will be for ELA, CASP ELA, and the other set will be for LPAC.
The focus group participants also had the opportunity to see the conceptual designs for other CASP and LPAC tests.
The purpose of showing the sample, the samples of the conceptual designs is to provide you an idea of what the focus group participants were shown.
I won't be going over the details of the conceptual designs, but would be happy to answer questions later if there are any.
So just very quickly, this is the conceptual design for English language arts and math.
The focus group participants were shown the current version of the student score reports, which you see on the left.
And then they were shown concepts, different design elements that you see on the right hand side.
And this is the LPAC version.
Again, on the left hand side is the current version for reference.
And then on the right hand side are the proposed conceptual designs.
So we're grateful to the parents, guardians, educators, administrators, and students and interest holders who took part in the focus group.
We definitely learned a lot.
Overall, all focus groups agreed that the conceptual designs presented were an improvement over the current versions of the student score reports.
They recommended using less text overall and definitely less jargon.
They wanted to make sure that they were as easy to understand as possible.
They indicated that where color is being used, it should be intentional.
So where we're using one color, it means the same thing in another area of the student score report.
They also recommended that graphics should be included where possible to provide visual aid and that the graphics should be easy to read.
We also asked parents and guardians for their input on the distribution of the reports.
Parents and guardians liked the convenience of electronic distribution.
And we've seen this increase, especially over the last several years, as more and more have used devices for their everyday living.
LEAs share that they still needed the ability to print the reports.
This was further confirmed during additional targeted surveys that were sent to the school districts.
The department and ETS took all of the feedback from the focus groups, from the technical advisory group, the assessment interest holders,
and the regional assessment network to prepare the proposed student score report mockups presented to the board in the June informational memo.
The proposed changes to the student reports included changes to the student score history section,
the return of the school and state averages, the scale score comparison,
combining the lexile and quantile measures to be included in the CASP ELA and math student score report.
Prior to this, it was a separate report. And for 2022, it's a separate report.
So combining lexiles and quantiles into the ELA math report, including new composite claim reporting for ELA and math for the adjusted test blueprint,
delivery to LEA parent portals as HTML files and PDFs,
and then consolidation of ELA mathematics and science results in one student score report.
And this would be for grades five, eight in high school.
And I'll go over these changes in the proceeding slides.
First, I'll show the proposed student score reports in full so you could see the overview.
And then I'll go over proposed elements in greater detail.
And I'll start with CASP first and then I'll move to LPAC.
All right. So what you see before you is the first page of the proposed CASP student score report.
This proposed mockup would be used to report the CASP ELA mathematics and science scores.
So it is a multi-page report. You'll see in the lower corner of the image.
It's page one of five. The report for the California Spanish assessment would be much smaller.
It would be a separate test, but it has a similar look and feel.
On this first page, the proposed mockup includes information on CASP as well as explanations of the performance levels.
The pages following the first page of the proposed CASP student score report would provide additional information about each content area.
And for CASP, it would be ELA and mathematics, which all students must take in grades three, eight and eleven.
This slide shows pages two and three, page two is on the left, page three is on the right,
which presents more information about the students ELA math results, ELA and math results,
with student score history and the new composite claim scores for each.
And I'll go over those two particular things in the next slides.
So this is the student score history that will be available for both, in this case, ELA and math.
The new student score history section will be available for grades four through eight,
for smarter balance, ELA and mathematics, CAA, the California alternate assessments for ELA and math, and the California Spanish assessment.
The score history will also be available for grades one through twelve for summative LPAC and summative alternate LPAC.
We are working through wording on grades three because they won't have a score history and then for kindergarten because they also wouldn't have necessarily have score history.
And then since scientists administering grades five, eight and once in high school, the CDE and ETS are looking into options to include the score history in the future.
So since California began using the adjusted test blueprints in 2020-21, the ELA and math claim scores were removed from the current student score reports.
So I'm pleased to say that the composite claims for the Smarter Balanced ELA math tests will be reported beginning with the 2023-24 administration, so this coming school year.
The new composite claims provided by Smarter Balanced are for use with the adjusted test blueprints for ELA and math, which California is continuing to use.
The left image shows the ELA math composite claims, which are reading and listening as a composite claim and writing and research as a composite claim.
And then similarly, the image on the right shows the mathematics composite claims, in this case, concepts and procedures and mathematical practices.
So what you're seeing on this slide are pages four and five of the student score report.
Page four here on the left includes the new ELA extended writing response information.
So this is the first time that we'll be reporting this on the student score reports forecast.
It also will include the Lexa and quantile measures.
This is what something that the focus groups have said to incorporate it with the actual student score report as for ELA math, rather than a separate report.
And then a score comparison section for ELA mathematics on page five, which is the image on the right.
So in this example, this is for potentially a grade five, eight or high school.
So the image on the right includes the science results and the science results include information on the science performance areas as well as the score comparisons.
And I'll talk more about the score comparisons table in later in more detail later in this presentation.
So this slide shows it's a blow up of the writing extended response scores that will be presented on the student score report.
So this will be the first time that students will and parents guardians will will see this on their students report.
This section provides additional information to the parent and guardians on how well the student performed in the extended writing response, depending on and the information would depend on the genre that that their student took.
So in this example, the student responded to a narrative essay and the scores were provided in the categories for a narrative genre.
In this case, organization and purpose, evidence and elaboration and conventions.
Next, I'll turn to the proposed LPAC summative LPAC student score report.
LPAC has two pages similar to CASP.
The first page shown on the left includes information about LPAC.
It also includes a student's overall summative LPAC score.
The second page on the right includes the score history as well as a student score on the on the oral language and written language domains.
Now I'll go back to the score comparison, which is available on many of these reports.
So I'm pleased to present that the proposed student score report mop ups include the return of the school and state comparisons for ELA and math.
Your child's score, and it includes three columns for each.
Your child's score shows the student score for the current administration.
In this example, this is for the 2023-24 administration.
The school and state average columns will be calculated using the average of the 2021-22 and 2022-23 administration.
So the previous two years, we use the average from the previous year so that the student score reports can be released as early as possible.
If we were to use the current year's school and state results, the student score reports would be actually held up until late summer when the statewide testing window closes in the middle of July.
The CDE and ETS continue to work on the student score report redesign and development.
This slide shows the high-level timeline of the activities presented and is as follows.
In its June 2023 information memo to the state board, the CDE outlined the proposed student score report redesign and reporting enhancements for CASP and LPAC, planned for the implementation starting in the 2022-23 administration.
This memo included one sample grade five CASP student score report, which you saw earlier, and one grade five summative LPAC student score report, highlighting the proposed design and reporting enhancements.
This month, the CDE welcomes feedback from the state board and interest holders regarding the submitted proposed design and reporting enhancements.
In August, the CDE and ETS will incorporate feedback from the state board and interest holders into the proposed report design and reporting enhancements.
In September, the department will present the recommended revisions to the student score reports at the September board meeting for approval.
In October, ETS will program the system with the approved student score reports and translate the student score reports into the required languages other than English.
And then in spring 2024, the plan is to release the redesigned student score reports for the 2023-24 CASP and LPAC summative assessments.
And in July 2024, when the new school year or test administration year starts, the CDE will release redesigned student score reports for initial LPAC and initial alternate LPAC for the 2024-25 administration.
And these links show are to the current student score reports, which are available on CASP.org and LPAC.org for reference.
And now I'll hand the presentation back over to Mao for questions.
Just a reminder to follow us on Twitter.
And for updates, people are very interested in assessments.
And then, Board President, should I pause here if you want to ask any clarifying questions or public comment?
Which one?
We may take some clarifying questions.
Are you at the end of the presentation other than putting up the public comment slide?
Yes.
Let's go ahead and put up the public comment slide so people can queue up if they're going to call in while we also take clarifying statements and questions.
And just I'll note that members of the public wishing to provide comment on this item may do so in person or by calling the telephone number and using the access code provided on the slide that's shown now.
We're waiting for members of the public to call in.
I want to call on member Orozco-Gonzalez as our liaison for any initial comments before me.
And then I'll see if there are any clarifying questions.
Great.
I want to express my gratitude for the informative presentation put together by Cheryl Cotton, Mao Vang, Mariana Osila, and their team.
Very informative.
I want to start off with the student score report redesign feedback and development.
As a teacher and a parent, I greatly appreciate the efforts taken by the CDE and the ETS to redesign the student score reports for CASP and ALPAC.
It is crucial to improve the reporting of test results and provide actionable information to students, parents, and guardians.
Timely access to test results while minimizing distribution for the LEAs is also commendable.
The involvement of students, educators, and parents and guardians in focus groups and feedback opportunities shows a commitment to inclusivity.
Thank you for prioritizing transparency and continuous improvement in the educational assessment.
Based on the focus group feedback, I'm pleased to see the redesigned student score reports have been acknowledged as an improvement over the current versions.
The suggestion to use less text, minimizing jargon is highly appreciated as it ensures clarity, accessibility to all stakeholders.
The intentional use of color and inclusion of ready, easy to read graphics will enhance the visual appeal and comprehension of the reports.
It's encouraging to know that parents and guardians are ready for electronic distribution while also recognizing the continued need for LEAs to be able to print the student score reports.
And thank you for valuing the input of the focus groups and prioritizing user-friendly designs that meet the needs of our diverse audiences.
The changes to the student score history section and the inclusion of school and state averages for skill score comparisons will provide valuable context for students, parents, and educators.
It's especially useful to me as a teacher in the classroom, combining lexile and quantile scores into a single score report streamlines the information and reduces the complexity.
The introduction of composite claim reporting for LEA and mathematics with adjusted blueprints will offer a more comprehensive understanding of student performance.
Lastly, consolidating ELA, mathematics, and science results into an SSR for grades five, eight, and high school simplifies the reporting process.
These revisions demonstrate a commitment to improving the clarity and usability of this document.
And as I always comment, for the interim assessments and Tools for Teachers update, I would like to highlight that starting August 1, 2023, educators will have access to the 23-24 Smarter Balanced Interim Assessments for ELA math, which will feature over 200 assessment forms.
As educators, we're constantly seeking ways to improve our teaching practices and enhance student learning experiences.
The Tools for Teachers website provides a wealth of instructional resources to support educators in improving their teaching practices and enhancing student learning experiences.
By exploring the various tools and materials on the platform, educators can uncover innovative teaching strategies, access grade-level performance descriptions, discover curated academic vocabulary lists, very helpful.
And these resources are integrated into the existing Interim Assessment Connections playlist, aligning into the specific content assessed by the corresponding Smarter Balanced Interim Assessment blocks.
This alignment provides valuable guidance for instruction and helps educators make informed decisions about their instructional next steps.
As we embark into the next school year, it's July, and I'm already planning, and all those curriculum guides, we can leverage these resources to tailor our lessons to meet the diverse needs of our students, utilizing the practical ways offered by Tools for Teachers website to incorporate these resources into our teaching repertoire.
So thank you so much for your information, and I hope that these new redesigns help our families learn more about our students and how we can best support them.
Thank you. I would like to just plus one on those very excellent comments, and thank you, Mal, and your team for all the work that's gone into this.
I think it's going to be a big advance. I do have a couple of specific comments when we get to that, when we get into discussion.
But I think we are off to a really good start on this new effort for amended score reports.
I do want to see if there are any clarifying questions, and Vice President Glover Woods has got one.
Mal, just a quick clarifying question regarding the federal peer review.
Do our adjusted blueprint ELA and math SBATs have to go through this federal peer review, and if so, what is the process and timeline for that?
Yes, that's a very good question. We did, for the full form that went through, the U.S. Department of Education did tell us that we are, we fully meet that.
However, with the adjusted blueprint, we will have to provide additional evidence in the coming months.
But when that becomes available, then we will submit it to meet any additional outstanding requirements.
And we'll work with the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium for that as well.
Any other clarifying questions? If not, we will turn to public comment and then come back for discussion shortly thereafter.
Sure. So do we have any public comment?
Are we doing it in the room first? Yes. Yes, in the room.
We do have one.
I'm sorry, just clarifying questions. Sorry. Member Yoshimura Otari.
Thank you. Clarifying question, I thought I heard that there were two focus groups for families, one in English, one in Spanish, one for teachers, one for students.
Can you just elaborate a little bit more on how many people participated in each of the focus groups?
And were they virtual? Were they across different parts of the state?
Sure. Mary Ann can provide those details.
There were typically anywhere from seven to nine per focus group. They were conducted virtually.
And we purposely asked our market research firm to make sure that there was a good distribution across the state, demographic, background, and so on.
Sorry? Seven to nine.
At that point, at this point, we'll then see if there's any public comment in the room.
We do have one public comment. Manuel Buenrostro.
If you want to get comfortable in a seat somewhere, in case we have a lot of public comment on the phone, you're welcome to do so.
We will see you later. Go right ahead.
Hello again, members of the State Board of Education. Again, it's Manuel Buenrostro with Californians Together.
And we align with the comments made in the LCFF Equity Coalition letter.
We also want to share our appreciation for the department's work in developing interim assessments for science and the LPAC.
We do want to note that interim assessments and tools for teachers were developed for ELA, math, and science, but not English language development.
And we do believe that teacher tools on ELD would be critical for the field and very valued in the field.
As you know, implementation of ELD is still a challenge for many LEAs and educators need a lot of support in that,
especially in making sure that we have integrated and designated English language development delivered for our students.
We also want to note that for the reports on student scores, we request that they be translated in all of the students' home languages and not just the required languages.
Thank you again for your work on this very important item.
Thank you. And do we have callers on the phone or any other in the room?
We do. There are currently seven callers in the queue. I'll open the phone line now.
Caller with the last four digits, 0325, you are now live. Please start your public comment.
Hello, can you hear me?
We can.
Okay, great. Thank you for taking my call.
I am a former full-time teacher, have left the world of education for the very reason of what has just gone, taken place in the last hour.
Honestly, this sounds like a lot of filibustering.
Math is a really concrete subject. It is not subjective.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
We are currently taking public comment for item number three.
I believe you would like to speak to item number 11.
Do you mind calling back later on this afternoon?
Thank you.
Oh, yes. Yes, you're right.
Thank you.
Next caller with the last four digits, 4369, you are now live. Please start your public comment.
Thank you. This is Sally Fox again on behalf of CABE and as a member of the coalitions for LCFF Equity and Californians Together.
We appreciate the department's work of developing interim assessments for science and the LPAC.
We note that the interim assessments and tools for teachers were developed for ELA, math and science, but not ELD.
And we believe ELD should be added if it's not on the list yet.
I'm still active as a certified trainer for OCDE Project GLAD and as an ELD consultant.
And I continue to observe the powerful positive effects on student learning when teachers use the ELD standards to provide
linguistic scaffolds to make content comprehensible and to design extended learning activities that develop literacy and English proficiency while integrating subject matter academic language.
So one way to think of it is tools to help teachers use the ELD standards for integrated and designated lessons will strengthen implementation of all our state standards.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Next caller with the last four digits 1659. You are now live. Please start your public comment.
Hello. Thank you for taking my call. I came to United States about three years ago from Ukraine.
And all I want to say is that unfortunately our public education is really going down.
And one of the reasons I'm talking is I am one of the teachers and my daughter is also one of the teachers.
So I want to just state one of the codes.
I just want to pray for all of you who are right now in this room.
I pray that you would see the righteousness in the sight of the Lord. I pray in Jesus name. Amen.
Thank you. Next caller with the last four digits 5116. You are now live. Please start your public comment.
Good morning board members. This is Jessica Stocco on behalf of Children Now.
I'd like to mostly just express my appreciation for today's item and all of the work of the assessment division here to really support all of the administration of the national and international assessments
and its engagement with education partners and particularly its work on tools for teachers to make resources available for ELA, math and science.
I would like to briefly comment that I do align my comments with the L.C.F. equity coalition letter and asking for additional languages for student score reports,
as well as elevate a concern we've expressed previously around the use of composite scores given the literacy crisis that we have in our state.
I think it's really important that we continue to disaggregate the language arts assessment into the four component parts that we used to have on our score reports.
Thank you. Thank you. Next caller with the last four digits 6642. You are now live. Please start your public comment.
I'm actually interested in item 11. What time will that be on?
We don't have a specific time frame, but if you could just call back in, please make sure you're watching the webcast and we will let you know when we take up that item.
Thank you. Thank you. OK, that concludes public comment for item number three.
With that, we are now open for discussion. And who would like to kick us off? And yes, thank you, Mal, for coming back up.
Yes, member Porter. I want to begin by just expressing my gratitude in detail going into this item.
If students and families can clearly understand what their student needs greatly helps.
And so thank you for including student voice in that process and in those discussions.
So on slide 28, I noticed that many questions were clumped together that are yes or no answers and one score is given for a variety of these writing skills.
And so I have like a question with a comment is, is there a way for students to access a breakdown of these areas in which they're stronger or weaker?
For example, like a student may have perfect spelling and capitalization, but needs more support on grammar.
But from my understanding, there's no way for them to understand that from the score report.
They just receive a one out of two on conventions, but I think it could be helpful to understand exactly where they need help.
So maybe a rubric would be more useful.
Yeah, I mean, this for the written extended response score here, this is the first time we've ever been able to provide it on the student score reports.
This is as granular as they can get. It is part of a summative assessment.
Right. So to get to some of those details, you could use the interim assessment or more of the ongoing assessments in the classroom to show some specific areas of weaknesses.
Again, we like to say the summative is just one one type of assessment and one resource or one point of comparison to other kinds of assessments that might provide that detail.
Thank you so much.
It was encouraging to see the number of interim assessments being used now.
And I think that gets to this question of how you get to more granularity on some of these things.
Member Roscoe Gonzalez, who else would like to be in the queue?
I just have a question now.
How does the department plan to address the absence of interim assessments for tool and tools for English language development, considering their importance and supporting language learning?
And additionally, are there any plans to expand the translation of sample student reports to include languages beyond the required ones in ensuring effective communication with all families in our community?
Let me take that first one in terms of LPAC.
Oh, and we are creating the in terms for LPAC to be used.
We have a rollout plan that will share more detail in September as well.
And then we are also looking at working with our contractors to develop resources for LPAC in the tools for teachers, too.
I don't have all the details yet.
You know, those are things we have to work through, but that is in the plan to also provide resources for LPAC or ELD specifically.
Let me see.
Let me see. Well, the second part of your question was.
Yes, please go ahead.
I said, are there any plans to expand the translation of sample student reports to include languages beyond the required ones, ensuring effective communication with all families in our communities?
Yeah, I mean, I just want to clarify a little bit that in terms of what is required, I think we are required to only translate in Spanish, but we are already going above and beyond to add these additional things for other languages.
And some of the other languages, there may be only like one percent of the students in the state who have that language as a primary language.
So we can look into it.
We will have to work with our assessment contractor and see what opportunities can be put forth so that we look at if there's any additional languages other than English that rise up in a higher percentage, we could look at potentially translating them in the future.
But at this time, we did go a little bit more above and beyond what we are required to do, and we will continue to look for ways to increase that when we can.
But thank you for the support of that.
Thanks, Vice President Glover Woods and then member Yoshimoto Tauri and then member Patillo Bronson.
Thank you for sharing the upcoming development of ELD resources and the tools for teachers.
That was going to be one of my questions, so I'm happy to know that's in the works and hope to see that very quickly.
This is a critical, critical area that our teachers need resources in as well as the others that are provided.
And I also want to say thank you so much for the redesign of the SSR.
I appreciate the family friendly questions that go along with the graphics.
It really makes it very clear what that actual score or rating aligns to.
So the time that was taken to develop those questions and embed them in the SSRs again, very family and family friendly and appreciative of that.
Thank you.
Let's see, was member Yoshimoto Tauri then member Patillo Bronson.
Just a couple of brief comments.
One is I'm glad to see there's initial positive feedback on the student score reports.
I asked the question about the focus groups because I just think for a state our size,
the more focus groups we can do, the better to get feedback from a diverse population.
And so I don't know if the timeline allows for that, but if we could maximize that, I would be interested in that.
And then thank you for going above and beyond with the translation.
I think the parents score report, the parents seeing their students results is always very important.
I would extend that also to the vendor links.
So when you look at the Lexile and you click to see what that means,
it might be possible to have the Spanish link default to Spanish rather than default to English and then have to take the extra step to click on the click on the translation button.
So little details like that, I think, would be helpful to explore.
Thank you.
I also just want to join the chorus of thank yous because it's, I think, really exciting to see it coming back in this full way with user friendly graphics,
but with the enhancements as well around some of the performance domains and the addition of the writing extended response scores,
which is really just very cool and I think a welcome additional piece of information.
I also had previously mentioned and really appreciate the inclusion of the state versus school versus individual student performance.
One of the data points, particularly on the early learning sort of TK to three side that was in a headline recently,
is that 93 percent of parents across the country believe that their kids are reading on grade level when in fact about a third in fact are.
And so really giving concrete sort of disaggregated data about how their kid is doing and also how their schools are and state are doing,
I think is really important.
I did have a question in part because I'm just curious about some of the interim assessments and whether there is any possibility or future plans to make those more readily available to parents.
Well, we do have the practice tests and training tests that are publicly available if parents and the public would like to look at that,
but you mean in terms of like administering them or seeing what they look like because they're not public,
but they're not secure where teachers could use it with students in the classroom.
More so to actually see the sort of data resulting from it rather than the test themselves.
Oh, like to get the results of the interims.
OK, well, that I'm sure the local educational agencies have access to it.
And because it's not a required test, how they share that out with the parents is something that we could maybe train,
provide in trainings or offer as an option if they would like to share that with parents.
But it is really a local decision.
If they want to share that out, it is to use to be used to support teachers and students in the classroom.
So that is a good suggestion.
And I think that perhaps some of the local educational agencies may like to use that approach.
Is there anybody else?
I want to add one more comment, but anybody else want to Jim?
Are you raising your eyebrow because you're ready to say something?
Trying to formulate my thoughts.
Are you ready?
I'm almost ready, I guess.
But this idea of the family friendly and the cultural lens, you know, and all the other languages that exist in California.
I'm very interested in that if we did explore other cultures or focus groups.
Again, my thoughts aren't fully organized on this.
I'm reminded about a study done through Arizona State University on gifted and talented and the lens,
the cultural lens that that brings forward for American Indian cultures and how different it is,
what's considered gifted and talented in one community is very different than in other communities.
And I would urge you to look at that study by Kishan Lara, a recent study.
But if we were to entertain this toolkit that you talked about for other cultures, I'd be very interested in helping and exploring that.
So thank you.
I wanted to go back to the point.
Were you also raising your finger?
Member Escobedo?
No, you're just.
I'm trying to get cues here.
Naomi's comment really resonated with me.
And really the granularity.
And I'm going to use a metaphor of my medical results and creating meaning to those results that are numbers.
But when they included a video and what exactly I could do because of these results really empowered me.
You know, and I know the research behind students take owning their learning and how critical it is that we can provide them a road map.
And how can they take ownership with their learning is so important.
And utilizing videos or any any type of AI to help students understand what their strengths are.
Right, Naomi, and how to empower themselves and their learning.
I think it's it's so important.
So thank you, Naomi, for bringing.
And I think that that really gets us to a little bit back to Mal's point.
There's what we can do on the summative test, which by the time we get it, the student is already six months older and in a different place.
What we can do on the interim assessments where there is follow up with tools for teachers.
But also, if you ever go to the page in the CDE website, among the many on diagnostic tests, there's a list of those that are recommended for the early grades.
But most of them go through K through at least eight and maybe further.
And some of them actually do have that coupling of diagnostic information and information about what to do next.
And I think that's an area for the classroom use of assessments that we hear about.
I may want to look further at for for the purpose of Smarter Balanced.
The fact that people are using the interim assessments and tools for teachers means that they're getting closer to that.
But that might be something we want to hear more about to now at some point further.
I'm going to make my couple of small comments, I think, now, which is, first of all, number one, thanks for all of the great work on it.
There is there are two little things that I wanted to comment on on the score reports.
I like them a lot. I think they're moving in a very good direction.
The claim scores have three categories and they are sort of below standard near standard and above standard or something like that.
And I read these multiple times was trying to just understand them.
And I kept saying, well, where is at standard near standards in our in our four tier process is nearing the standard is below at standard.
I think it would be helpful to name that at or near standard, since what I finally figured out is that it includes the students who have met the standard and those who are within some band around the standard.
So I just think that's a naming thing. It does mean adding more words to the page.
Just two little ones that I would hope could be fit in so that parents won't be as confused as I was when I was trying to figure out.
Yeah, we're we're at the standard was well, at the claim level, there's not as many items.
Right. So I think in the early years, I'm not saying make it four.
I'm just saying the three categories are fine. But the fact that that includes at as well as around.
Yeah. For that very same concern or comment that you have, that was confusing when we had we did have it as at or near in the initial years.
But then it people said it was too confusing. And since the it was more near seemed to be a little bit more or less definitive, since there's no that's what made it confusing.
Yeah. So we have a little bit if you would test that a little bit more.
I believe that that's what occurred. I mean, before even I arrived as well.
So in California, we have been using near versus at or near.
So I don't know if you want to add anything, Marianne. That's what I remember.
Yeah, that's that's exactly right.
And we could certainly test out the preference for at at or near standard versus near standard with.
It'd be great to see if you get some focus groups just to focus on that, whether there is, you know, similar question about, you know, because we're all used to looking for where's the standard.
And then when you look across and it's never identified that any of them are actually at the standard, it feels a little confusing.
So anyway, if others are if others vote differently, I will receive their wisdom.
I just like folks will have that.
The other thing that I really like about what you've done is that you show the scale scores and how those are progressing over time.
And in slides 19 and 20, you did that with a little line that went across the.
Yeah, you can see the little line that goes across the bars in line slide 25.
The line has disappeared and it's just like three little dot points or something.
And I I couldn't even see them when I looked at it earlier when I was reviewing the material.
So I would just vote for the clearer designation of the line rather than just three little dots.
I know these are tiny points.
Well, you know, I care about our students go reports.
And then I think that you in the final version, you do have the link to the Lex Island quantile website.
Is that right?
Because in some of the slides, it was there and in others it wasn't.
And I just wanted to be sure that it is there in the final final, which would be around slide 25 somewhere.
And my eyes aren't all that good.
So there it is.
It's there.
Is that little blue thing?
Is that the URL?
OK, thank you.
I think it's very helpful for parents who really care about this to be able to go and get our teachers.
As member Roscoe Gonzalez said to actually be able to go and and see what to do about it to the point that members Porter and Escobedo were making.
All right. Thank you.
I think we have given you all our feedback.
Let's address.
I thought about something for when member Yoshimoto Tauri mentioned about having more focus groups.
Initially, when we we had the focus groups, we tried to make them as representative as possible.
And we hope that they were representative of the different voices out there.
And it wasn't just the focus groups that informed this.
But like Mary, I mentioned we took it to interest holders, the various educational partners, as well as our regional assessment network folks who work directly on with the different LEAs on this type of work.
And then we also want your input as our board members as well.
So hopefully this process can provide you that opportunity to provide further and specific feedback.
And we will definitely make those adjustments as best as we can before we bring it back to you for review and approval.
Thank you so much. Appreciate it.
And with that, I'm going to thank Mao and move us on to the consent agenda.
And we need the public comment slide displayed again.
We are up to item four through 10 basically.
There we go.
All right.
We're going to open the phone line for the queue for public comment on consent items four through 10.
Members of the public wishing to provide comment on consent items four through 10 may do so in person or by calling the phone number and using the access code provided in the slide that's shown now.
Are there any speakers signed up to provide public comment in person?
Somebody knows the answer to this question.
I'm going to take that as a no.
There are no people signed up to provide public comment in person.
Is there anyone waiting to provide public comment on the phone line?
No, there is not.
All right.
Given that there's no further public comment, I'll ask for a motion on consent items four through 10.
Do I have a motion?
Member Oscoe-Gonzalez, do I have a second?
Member Lewis, thank you.
At this point, all in favor, please raise your hand and say aye.
Aye.
All right. Any opposed?
Any abstentions?
Motion carries. Thank you.
And then I'd like to reopen item one and take a moment to recognize our student board member, Naomi Porter.
This is Naomi's last meeting before she goes to college at Vanderbilt in the fall.
We're happy to announce that Naomi's state assembly member, Al Maratsuchi, prepared a legislative resolution honoring her for her service that we are here to present to her.
And I'm not going to read the whole thing, but I will just simply say that it recognizes her work to raise the profile of the board and its work for students across the state.
She has participated in a children's entrepreneurship program in sixth grade.
She launched her first business, Spice It Up, at the age of 11 in support of struggling students.
She started Bright Futures Tutoring when she was 13 years old.
In 2019, to address student needs for relevant experiences outside of the school system, she founded entrepreneurship, Y-O-U in the middle there,
a nonprofit educational equity program that has engaged more than 3,000 young people from 42 countries in its evidence-based entrepreneurial mindset exercises
and earned her the Employees Choice Award at the Prudential Financial Emerging Visionary Summit.
She also received a grant from the Karma for Kara Foundation to launch a financial literacy book club
and partnered with the Boys and Girls Clubs of Los Angeles Harbor to create the Idea Lab for students to receive consultations on developing startup businesses.
And on and on, we are so proud of you, Naomi.
You've brought that same kind of energy and thoughtfulness and insight and advocacy for students to the board.
We wish you all the best at Vanderbilt.
We hope you'll be back in California for graduate school.
And I would like to present you with this.
Naomi, do you want to come up here for a photo?
OK, we'll do it from here.
There we go.
We'll avoid my teacups.
I had to get some keppi this morning.
There you go.
Got it?
Sorry to say to those in the audience, we're going to have cake later.
I know Superintendent Thurman already gave you some remarks here, Naomi.
So I just wanted to also present you with a certificate from the California Department of Education.
Thank you so much for being and bringing student voice.
So very proud of you.
So excited for you to be going to Vanderbilt.
And thanks for making me feel like a slacker.
But really looking forward to seeing what you do in the future.
Thank you.
Awesome.
Congratulations, Naomi.
And I'm going to invite board members if anyone wants to offer any brief comments.
And then I'll ask Naomi if she would like to offer any comments.
Member Yoshimoto-Tari.
I'll kick us off by just saying, Naomi, we're so proud of you.
And you've inspired me personally in so many ways.
And as many of you know, we realize that we have childhood friends.
So we go back a long way in the small world.
And we look forward to you coming back.
Thank you.
Member Olken and then Vice President Gloverwood.
Naomi, I miss you already.
And I have just been in awe of you since the moment I met you.
And I'm so excited for where you're going and all that you're going to do.
And thankful for the legacy that you've already created in your own community and across the state.
You're so awesome.
So stay in touch.
Thank you.
Vice President Gloverwood.
And Naomi, I just did all of that.
You are definitely a rock star.
I stand in awe of you from the moment I had an opportunity to meet you through your interviews.
You have just done so much in the amount of time you've been here on this earth.
And I'm even more excited and filled with anticipation to see what you will do moving forward.
I wish you all the best as you go to Tennessee.
I'll be sending you those food places for sure.
And just thank you.
And it was an honor to be able to serve with you.
Member Roscoe-Gonzalez.
Well, I expressed already having breakfast with her today.
But I wanted to express my heartfelt gratitude for your exceptional service.
Your dedication, expertise, unwavering commitment to education has just made such a profound impact already on your just teenage life.
You have tirelessly advocated for students, enhanced entrepreneurial opportunities, created an environment for conductive to growth and learning.
And as you embark on your journey to Vanderbilt, I extend my warmest wishes for your continued success, fulfillment,
your thirst for knowledge and drive to make a difference is truly inspiring.
So thank you for your outstanding service.
And I eagerly await and anticipate hearing everything about your journey.
Congratulations.
Oh, OK.
Member Lewis.
Well, I just have to get in on the bandwagon.
Naomi, you are a remarkable young lady and it has been a pleasure serving with you.
And I know that we're going to hear great things about you in the future and that you're going to make an immediate impact on the campus at Vanderbilt.
So I just wish you the best and all of your your academic pursuits and your career pursuits.
And again, it was just an honor to serve with you.
And thank you for representing all of the students in California.
So outstandingly. Thank you.
And member Rodriguez, I'm sorry.
Yes. Yes.
So, Naomi, it's been an absolute pleasure getting to know you and sitting next to you.
And in the words of the philosopher Taylor Swift,
it's about learning to dance in the rain.
And I see you doing that with your service, your tendency to serve others, which is something that is so inherent in you.
And I see how you derive so much joy and bring so much joy to all of those of us who are around you.
So I look forward to seeing where you're going to take this next and to follow you.
Thank you. And, Naomi, do you want to say anything? A few words?
Yeah, I'll say a little bit. Thank you guys so much.
Honestly, this past year has been phenomenal meeting each of you.
I've had the opportunity to work with it's the honor of a lifetime.
Truly. Thank you to the amazing CDE and State Board of Education staff,
who never really fail to amaze me with their work effort and willingness to answer 18 year old's questions.
And to Superintendent Thurman and his team for just his vision for our state.
And to the students who trusted me with this role.
I'm very excited to be attending Vanderbilt where I'll be studying at HOD,
which is Human and Organizational Development in the Peabody School of Education.
And I'm just very excited to be an Ingram Scholar there,
where I'm going to be continuing to serve the community of Nashville for four hours a week.
I get to curate this summer service project.
So if you have any ideas for me, I will be hitting all of you up.
And I'm just very excited to be continuing my public service career.
And I really do plan to come back to serve our state in some capacity in an elected or appointed position
as a school board member, nonprofit leader or a government employee.
I'm confident that my successor Anya will find great success here with this board that cares so deeply for the success of its students.
And I look forward to training her and helping her ease into this role.
And so thank you to each of you for your kind words and just for the ways that you continue to make our state one
that prioritizes student well-being and inclusivity and personal and professional growth.
This has truly been a great year.
And so thank you for all the ways that you continue to shape our great state.
And with that, we will break for lunch and we will be back at around one o'clock.
Thank you very much.
All right.
Welcome back from lunch.
Item 11 is our next item.
It is a public hearing regarding the adoption of the 2023 mathematics framework for California public schools, kindergarten through 12th grade.
I hereby open the public hearing at 1 0 6 p.m.
The CDE recommendation is that we hold a public public hearing and adopt the draft mathematics framework,
including the revisions proposed in response to the public comment received during the second field review.
Members of the public that is posted on the website, members of the board, you also have a hard copy in front of you.
The CDE also recommends that the state board delegate authority to state board and CDE staff to make any necessary revisions
as the document is professionally edited and prepared for publication.
The current draft of the mathematics framework is available on the CDE mathematics curriculum framework web page.
And this item will be presented by Cheryl Cotton and Mike Torres of the CDE with several additional presenters that Cheryl and Mike will introduce as we go along.
And Cheryl, I'm well, you are not Cheryl.
Mike, nice to see you.
Nice to see you too, Cheryl, over there in the corner.
Mike, please begin.
And I just want to say before Mike starts, this has been a long process.
Three or four year process.
Mike has been steering us along this path.
And we are so, so grateful to him.
Mike, you're you're up.
Thank you so much, Board President Linda Darling Hammond.
And good afternoon, members of the board, board president.
Good afternoon, Chief Deputy Mary Nicely.
My name is Dr. Mike Torres and I serve as the executive director of the Instructional Quality Commission.
I'm also the director of the curriculum frameworks and instructional resources division here at the CDE.
Lovingly referred to as Seaford.
It's my honor and my privilege to be in front of you today.
I'm just incredibly excited about this mathematics framework that you're about to to act upon today to present the proposed mathematics framework for California Public Schools kindergarten through grade 12.
Before I jump into the presentation, I do want to give a little bit more about my background and how I got to where I'm here today.
I'm really proud to say that I am a product of California's public school K-12 system.
I went to school in the Bay Area, not that far from here.
I had many opportunities to to learn a lot of teachers who saw the potential in myself.
I personally was able to make it to calculus by 12th grade.
And that was my journey through mathematics.
I loved mathematics, but yet I loved science more.
I was able to go straight to UC Davis, prepared well for for college.
My college outcomes got my degree in genetics, became a biotech scientist and did that for about four years.
Amazing, amazing work.
And one day when my my lab colleagues and I were since standing there feeding the machines, doing all of the different essays,
our boss actually asked us, who wasn't that much older than us, is what do you want to do when you grow up?
And I was like, well, wait a minute, I went to college to get this degree and do this job.
And it really got me thinking, what am I passionate about?
And that answer was education.
Passionate about education, went back to school, became a math and science teacher, did that for about nine years.
And I've been working here at the department going on tenures.
I'm very excited again about this mathematics framework because of what it what it holds for that potential for students across our state.
My own sons also went to school here in in California, both of them very different.
As most most parents know, sons can be siblings, can be totally polar opposites of each other.
And one made it to calculus, one finished at integrated mathematics three.
The one that went to calculus actually decided to major in economics and not follow that math path.
The one that went to integrated three decided to go into a business major.
They're both in our UC and CSU systems right now.
So it's important for all students to have the different opportunities available in mathematics to really to really get them interested in it and get them to that college outcome.
All right, I'm going to take take aside from that, my personal and then move on to our presentation.
There we go. So the CDE does recommend that the State Board of Education adopt the twenty twenty three mathematics framework for California public schools, kindergarten through grade 12.
Including the revisions proposed in response to the public comments received during the second field review and since posting for this board meeting, the CDE also recommends that the State Board delegate authority to the State Board of Education and CDE staff to make any necessary revisions, including any needed for clarity and accuracy as the document is professionally edited and prepared for publication.
The current draft mathematics framework is available on the CDE mathematics curriculum framework web page at the website listed.
So I have with me today the following co-presenters.
First off, Deputy Superintendent of Public Instruction Cheryl Cotton, who will be speaking to you here in just a short while.
Ellen Barger is the assistant superintendent of curriculum and instruction at the Santa Barbara County Office of Education.
She's also the chair of the Curricular and Improvement Support Committee organized by the California County Superintendents and is also the co-chair of the Mathematics Subcommittee of that organization.
Dr. Lindsay Gotanda is the assistant superintendent of the Paramount Unified School District.
She serves as vice chair of the Instructional Quality Commission and also serves as the Commission's Mathematics Subject Matter Committee chair.
Dr. Marla Clayton Johnson is the administrator of the CDE's curriculum frameworks unit, responsible for development of our curriculum frameworks.
Mr. Omawali Moses is the chief executive officer of Math Talk, a community based education technology company.
Dr. Kendall Brown is the executive director of the California Mathematics Project, a position that he has held since 2012.
And Dr. Adrian Mims is the founder of the Calculus Project, which was created to increase the number of black, Hispanic, low income enrolled students in calculus honors, AP calculus, and AP statistics so they can pursue STEM careers themselves.
So at this time, I'm going to pass the presentation over to Deputy Superintendent of Public Instruction Cheryl Cotton.
Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you, Dr. Torres. I love to hear his story.
I just want to share that as an educator with almost 30 years, I'll be at 30 years next year in education as a classroom teacher, as a site in district and county office administrator.
This is a this is a big moment today, and we are so pleased to share this information with you to share this framework with you.
Kudos to everyone who has worked on this up until now. Thank you, Mike and your team for diligently kind of holding us to this path.
We have for you today, the draft 2023 mathematics curriculum framework for your consideration.
First, let's define what is a framework. California Education Code 51002 calls for the development of broad minimum standards and guidelines for educational programs.
Curriculum frameworks offer guidance for implementing content standards.
Frameworks describe the curriculum and instruction necessary to help students achieve proficiency and they specify the design of instructional materials and professional development.
Further, they provide guidelines and selected research based approaches for implementing instruction to ensure optimal benefits for all students.
Audiences for frameworks include teachers, school administrators and decision makers, publishers and developers of instructional materials and other education partners.
Frameworks are based on current and confirmed research. Discuss all students.
I'm sorry, I do want to idea that I do want to note that when we talk about our frameworks, we're talking about all students and all means all.
We're focused on access and equity for every curriculum framework curriculum frameworks in the core curricular areas of English language arts, English language development,
mathematics, history, social science and science are aligned to SBE adopted academic content standards.
In addition, the state board has adopted content standards and frameworks in frameworks, sorry, in visual and performing arts, physical education, health education and world languages.
So why do we need a revised framework?
The 2013 mathematics framework was the first framework developed after the adoption of the California Common Core State Standards for Mathematics.
The 2013 framework was centered on focus, rigor and coherence, reflecting shifts in the new standards.
It contained grade level chapters.
It was highly descriptive, especially in the grades TK through eight.
It included cluster level emphasis at each grade level with examples of activities and descriptions for each standard for math practice and domain.
The 2013 Common Core aligned framework was developed so soon after the standards adoption that it couldn't benefit from practical experience.
Of teachers teaching those standards and the speed in which technology is advancing exceeds the guidance in the existing framework.
California must make sure our schools are keeping up with growing need in both the tech and to become data literate.
While the standards have not changed, our context in California has.
While the standards have not changed, our context in California has.
We have a dashboard, as you heard this morning, an accountability system that provides us more information regarding student achievement.
We also have a new funding formula and the local control accountability plans, as well as the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress, our California's assessment system.
On California's most recent reported Smarter Balanced Assessment, only 33 percent of students met or exceeded math proficiency standards in 2022.
And substantial achievement gaps exist, especially for black, American Indian, Alaska Native, and Latino students.
California students demonstration of deep mathematical learning on local and state assessments continue to be a concern and a priority for districts.
To address the urgent need to improve mathematics learning, the framework builds on learning from almost 10 years of implementing the 2013 Common Core state standards.
And provides new guidance to jumpstart and accelerate learning.
Helping students develop the thinking skills and content knowledge necessary to master the standards is critical to improving academics performance and creating conditions for later success.
This revision updates the guidance for teachers, administrators, and other educational decision makers to ensure effective implementation of the standards.
So now that we've explained the need for the revised framework, I have the pleasure of introducing you to Ellen Barger, the chair of the Curricular and Improvement Support Committee and co-chair of the Mathematics Subcommittee.
Thank you.
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond and esteemed members of the board.
As Deputy Superintendent Cotton said, my name is Ellen Barger and I am Associate Superintendent of Curriculum and Instruction for the Santa Barbara County Education Office.
I serve as the chair of the Curricular and Improvement Support Committee of the California County Superintendents and I have chaired the Mathematics Subcommittee for nine years.
In my more than 30 years in public education, I've been a mathematics teacher, a tutor, an administrator, instructional coach, math coordinator, director of curriculum, and an active member of California Math Council,
the California Math Education Collaborative, California Math Project, I know all these people behind me.
And I come to you today with a deep sense of gratitude and responsibility as I share the why of the 2023 mathematics framework and why it is so important.
But today is also significant for me personally.
I am the daughter of a mathematician who specialized in analysis, graph theory, and algebraic topology.
My father, an orphan whose mathematical lineage makes them a direct descendant of Hilbert, Klein, Euler, and Gauss, for those of you familiar with the math genealogy project.
He spent his career both contributing to the collective human understanding of mathematics and removing exclusionary barriers to its access, to its power, its beauty, and awe.
And today is my late father's birthday, the first since his passing.
And so I offer my words in his honor as well.
In this next few minutes, I'll address the importance for students, the importance for educators, and the sense of urgency and timeliness of this framework.
So the importance for students.
This beautiful Frances Sue quote from chapter one, page two, grounds the importance of this framework, mathematical affection.
And for those people who are just listening, I'll read it aloud.
A society without mathematical affection is like a city without concerts, parks, or museums.
To miss out on mathematics is to live without an opportunity to play with beautiful ideas and to see the world in a new light.
Mathematical affection, much of our attention has been given to recent test scores and other quantitative measures of student performance and outcomes in mathematics.
And rightfully so.
Not because they are the goal or the point, but taken collectively, these indicators are the proverbial canary in a coal mine, indicating current conditions for mathematical thriving.
Mathematical affection, mathematics is not merely something to be performed, but the foundations for thinking, for sense making, for imagining, and for creating.
All students, each and every California student, has the right and the ability to build an internal understanding of mathematics that can grow, adapt, and change throughout their life.
It starts with curiosity, play, and experimentation, and develops through engagement, exploration, and essential meaning making through supported construction of language and representation.
Revisiting concepts at increasing levels of complexity and search of truth, clarity, wonder, and amazement, all of this helps students build that flexible, dynamic web of mathematical connections, concepts, and skills necessary for all of their life's pursuits.
As we look back over the four years that this framework has been in development, our world has changed in ways that none of us would have predicted.
The expansion of AI, large language models, and centrality of data has exploded seemingly overnight.
We survived a pandemic and a racial, we endured a racial reckoning, and we are developing new and exciting career technical education pathways for our students.
We are preparing students for a world beyond our imagination and even beyond theirs.
So this framework provides effective approaches for ending exclusionary practices in mathematics education and creating opportunities that foster mathematical agency and identity for all students, whatever their future holds.
And so now if you look at this next slide, this is about the importance for educators.
The 2023 draft mathematics framework not only offers a compelling vision of mathematical engagement and equity for California students, but honors and supports the educators who must actualize it.
The impact of the past four years has settled squarely on the shoulders of our educators, and still they persevere with conditions of the present to create a better future.
Through the drivers of investigation, the focus on standards for mathematical practice, the content connections and big ideas, educators and students will deepen their knowledge of mathematics and build internal interconnected conceptual understanding.
This framework unfolds the why, the what, and the how, providing both new and veteran educators a starting point for collaboration and supports them on their journey of a continuous improvement.
So the why, the drivers of investigation, those overarching experiences, those overarching goals that will stay true even as our world changes.
The how, the standards for mathematical practice, which everyone who reads them agrees are exactly what we want students to take away.
And finally, the what, the content connections along with the big ideas mapping are absolutely crucial as we work together to counter the impact of lost learning opportunities and the difficulties of re-engagement.
This dimensional approach offers meaning and substance to the implementation of real focus, rigor, and coherence.
And so the county offices of education, who are at the center of our system of support, see firsthand the relentless commitment of our teachers, principals, and district leaders to engage and re-engage in healing and continuous improvement.
Next slide, please.
Some of our current conditions include educators working to maintain grade level expectations for students who missed large chunks of content.
This means thinking and planning in new ways.
For veteran teachers, this is a different reality, and they are teaching a different student.
The percentage of new teachers in many of our districts who did not have the typical pre-service student teaching or induction experiences and are learning their craft on the job, and reliance on materials that were created almost a decade ago, these all create a sense of urgency.
Emerging from the pandemic's significant and disparate impacts, teachers are seeking clarity and guidance to ensure mathematics that is engaging, enjoyable, meaningful, and inclusive.
School leaders want and need support in building systems, adopting instructional resources, designing courses, pathways, and providing high-level professional learning to support high-quality mathematics instruction for each and every child.
Our educators deserve these multi-layered supports, the structural, the instructional, the cultural, as well as the assurance that comes with substantial research and the thoughtful design of this very practical, user-friendly framework.
By adopting the 2023 Mathematics Framework, we can fulfill our commitment to educators by providing them the proper tools and supports necessary to help them succeed.
Finally, as we look back over the four years that this framework has been in development, our world, as I said, has changed in ways that none of us would have predicted.
The need is urgent, and the timing couldn't be better.
The process has taken a long time, but it has allowed many voices to be heard and has resulted in a deeper, important understanding, better conversations, and provided insight into the complexities that we all must grapple with as we roll this out.
The pandemic's significant impact. We have a year of recovery under our belt, and folks are looking for a way forward.
We, the CISC subcommittees, with the state agencies, with our partners, are poised and committed to engage and re-engage educators who are teaching in very different conditions than when this started.
As I said, we're poised and eager to collaborate together to roll out the framework, develop toolkits and implementation resources tailored to the needs of all of California's children.
Adoption of this framework will empower us all to boldly propel California mathematics forward.
Thank you.
Thank you so much, Ellen. We appreciate the very passionate and amazing words that you've uplifted to this conversation, and also I want to acknowledge a very happy birthday to your late father.
Before I jump right into the development process for this mathematics framework that you have before you, I'd like to share a bit about the State Board of Education's advisory body that's responsible for curriculum and instruction.
That would be the Instructional Quality Commission, or the IQC.
The IQC develops and recommends curriculum frameworks and model curricula.
It develops and recommends criteria for evaluating those instructional materials that are submitted for evaluation.
Finally, it evaluates instructional materials and makes recommendations to the State Board of Education to adopt or reject each program that is submitted for evaluation.
Education Code 33530 requires that at least seven of the 13 members of the IQC be appointed by the State Board shall be recognized authorities in specific subject matter fields.
At least seven of the 13 public members appointed by the State Board shall be current K-12 classroom teachers, mentor teachers, or both.
The public members of the Commission, and that includes the State Board and legislative appointed officials, serve a four-year term and cannot serve more than one full term.
The legislative members appointed to the IQC serve at the pleasure of their appointing body.
Recent legislation authorized the State Board of Education to appoint a student member to the Commission, and the student member will serve for one year.
So far, the IQC has had four student members now.
The IQC structure has an executive committee that includes a chair, a vice chair, and three additional members.
The IQC also includes smaller subcommittees for each of the different subject matters that they may hear, including mathematics.
Each subcommittee takes up the relevant curricular work and makes recommendations to the whole Commission for their consideration.
The Commission is a well-designed body to handle multiple curricular-related topics, whether it be curriculum frameworks, model curricula, or instructional materials adoptions.
So now that we're ready, we're primed, we know about the instructional body, we know about why we need a framework.
Here's the framework development process in a nutshell.
I'm going to go through four years now in one slide, believe it or not.
I'll start with this overall process.
So the process for developing a curriculum framework is a long and complex one with the specific steps that are detailed in our Title V California Code of Regulations.
The process is intended to be open and transparent at multiple points throughout the process.
And those opportunities create opportunities for public feedback and comments.
As Ellen had mentioned, California has a great process for creating and improving the overall product through this amazing cycle of development.
The process of revising or developing a framework begins with conducting focus groups with educators from all over California.
From those focus groups, clear themes and points of agreement will typically emerge in those meetings,
and the input will be gathered and become the foundation for an IQC recommended and eventually State Board of Education adopted set of guidelines for revision or development of that framework.
While the focus groups are occurring in tandem, the Curriculum Frameworks and Evaluation Criteria Committee, or CFCC, are recruited through a publicly available application.
The CFCC members and the State Board of Education, the IQC recommends those CFCC members after reviewing those applications.
Again, that occurs at a public meeting with public input.
And then the State Board of Education reviews the recommendations from the IQC at their next meeting, again, another public meeting.
After the CFCC is appointed, they come together for meetings where they discuss and make recommendations for revisions to the draft framework based on those guidelines that were then generated by the focus groups.
Once the CFCC completes their work, they forward the draft framework to the Instructional Quality Commission, which then approves the framework for its first mandated 60-day public comment period, and there's two of those mandated.
After the first public review period ends, the IQC then reviews the public comment that was received, makes edits and recommends revisions, then places the framework back out for a second 60-day public review.
Finally, the public comment from that second 60-day public comment period is considered and is considered a revised framework, and the draft goes before the State Board of Education for its consideration.
That's where we are today.
So now it's time to talk about the specific details of that development process, now a little bit more slowly, specific for this mathematics framework.
The first action that took place to start us on this journey to the framework that you have before you today began on March 28, 2019.
That was when the IQC approved the proposed schedule of significant events and the application for those educators to serve on the CFCC.
The schedule of significant events proposes those milestone dates for when each of those events that I just shared with you on the previous slide might occur.
The State Board of Education approved that schedule and the CFCC application for mathematics at its May 2019 meeting.
As you may recall, that schedule ultimately was revised by the State Board of Education multiple times for a multitude of reasons, one of which has to do with the COVID-19 pandemic.
To continue to take us on the journey to the current draft of the mathematics framework, I'm going to call on one of our co-presenters, Dr. Lindsay Gotanda.
Dr. Gotanda is the vice chair of the Instructional Quality Commission and is currently the chair of the Mathematics Subject Matter Committee.
Thank you, Mike, and thank you to the board for providing leadership during this unexpectedly long process of the development of the revised mathematics framework.
As noted, the drafting of the framework begins with focus groups of educators and the selection of a framework committee.
The process took place in 2019. There were four educator focus groups held around the state.
In addition, we had our inaugural student focus groups with students grades 2 through 12 here in Sacramento County.
Throughout the process, we received numerous written comments and conducted an informal focus group style activity with the Mathematics and Science Community of Practice at their November meeting.
The hundreds of comments were then compiled and distilled in a focus group report that was shared with the IQC.
The information from the focus group report was to inform the creation of the guidelines for the development of this framework.
In November 2019, the IQC reviewed the recommended guidelines to the SBE, which approved the guidelines at its January 2020 meeting.
The guidelines were used by the writers as they began writing the framework and are the basis of the work of the CFCC.
The SBE guidelines require that the framework reflect the goal of achieving conceptual understanding, problem solving capacity, and procedural fluency in mathematics,
and demonstrate how these goals are consistent with the California Common Core State Standards in Mathematics assessment specifications using the standards for mathematical practices.
As you likely know, there are eight standards for mathematical practice, and they inform teachers as to the skills that students need in order to be proficient in math.
The framework supports a learning progression from transitional kindergarten through grade 12 and ensures that all students can achieve college and career readiness.
To do so, it illustrates the connection between mathematics and other disciplines, such as the CTE Pathways and the Next Generation Science Standards.
It will include strategies for supporting a growth mindset in mathematics, which is much needed,
The guidelines provide suggested courses for both traditional algebra, geometry, Algebra 2, and integrated math 1, 2, and 3 high school mathematics pathways.
The CFCC is an advisory committee of 20 mathematics practitioners, the majority of whom are mathematics instructors at the time of the appointment, to assist in the process of developing a curriculum framework.
In this case, the framework committee had just started meeting when the COVID-19 pandemic hit.
As with many processes around the world and in education, the pandemic delayed the meetings and focused us to shift towards a virtual format.
The committee responded to this change with their usual professionalism, and they continued to review the interim drafts, provided voluminous feedback to the writing team for revisions and edits.
Each CFCC meeting was publicly noticed and open to the public with opportunities for the public to make comment each day of the meeting.
Ultimately, there were eight CFCC meetings that were held throughout 2020.
The IQC math SMC members attended each of the CFCC meetings as observers.
At the conclusion of the CFCC's work, they voted to recommend their draft of the mathematics framework to the IQC.
All of the meetings of the CFCC were open to the public, and an opportunity for public comment was provided during each day of the meetings.
At the time, I was actually lucky enough to be one of the observers, and I can tell you that the work that was done at that time was remarkable.
It was like nothing ever stopped.
As we move to the first 60-day review, in January 2021, the IQC approved the posting of the draft for the first 60 public day review and comment period, which took place in February through April of 2021.
Commenters would submit comments via an online survey form posted on the CDE website or via email to a dedicated email box for the math framework revision.
Altogether, more than 500 individuals and groups submitted suggestions for the changes to the draft.
Several comments related to the framework's approach to middle school and high school coursework, specifically in the area of acceleration in middle school and the draft guidance around grade 8 algebra.
Commenters cited concerns about limiting opportunities for advanced students to reach calculus by 12th grade.
There were also comments about how the framework discouraged tracking, asserting that the framework's recommendation would increase those inequities by reducing opportunities for students of color with a high ability to excel.
There were also concerns about a citation to a pathway to equitable math instruction.
Others advocated for a more user-friendly document that is shorter in length.
Finally, many commenters provided specific suggestions for line edits that were considered by the IQC at its May 19, 2021 meeting.
Many of these suggested edits were integrated into the revised draft for the second field review.
In response to all of those comments, the IQC approved nearly 700 total edits to the framework at its meeting on May 19, 2021.
The IQC also called for further changes, including requests for the writers to add significant additional support for teachers in several chapters.
They wanted to provide specific guidance for LEAs on mathematics acceleration in middle school, ensure that there is at least one vignette for each of the grade-level chapters that addresses how to teach students in heterogeneous classrooms,
moving the reference to the pathway to equitable math instruction, rewriting the sections to have clear guidance on meeting the needs of high achieving students,
and guidance on accelerated pathways specifically specifying that those were decisions were local.
The title chains and sections issues with acceleration in middle grades to clarify that the guidance does not reject acceleration as an option,
making clarifying edits to a vignette and graphic that was included on page eight.
The SMC also approved a list of recommended edits included as an attachment to the May 2021 IQC agenda that included hundreds of edits suggested by the public comment that would address at the writer's discretion.
The IQC then approved the math framework with these edits to go to the SBE for action following the second 60-day public review period.
And now I will pass the presentation back to Mike to finish the journey of where we are today.
Thank you.
All right, so that takes us to the second 60-day field review.
And thank you so much, Dr. Gotanda.
Thank you for all of your work on the IQC since you started there in 2000.
Thank you.
As you can imagine, carefully incorporating the nearly 700 edits and broad recommendations in response to the public comment from the first field review was a meticulous and careful process.
The second draft was heavily revised in response to the IQC's request throughout the summer and fall of 2021 and into the winter of 2022.
Ultimately, the revised draft was posted for a second field review that took place from March 14 through May 16 of 2022.
Apologize for not advancing the slide there.
I've got the clicker.
Ultimately, the revised draft was posted for that second field review.
During that field review, the CDE received more than 900 comments.
So far exceeding the 500 we received in the first field review and the 700 edits from the IQC post first field review.
Keep in mind that that's 900 individual commenters, each with anywhere from a single line edit on one page to 100 pages of line edits, calling for extensive and specific revisions of the draft.
As is often the case with projects that require additional capacity, the CDE and the State Board of Education worked in partnership with the Region 15 Comprehensive Center, or R15CC, led by WestEd, to complete the review and analysis of the feedback from that second field review.
The R15 Comprehensive Center is part of the federally funded National Comprehensive Center Network and provides capacity building, technical assistance, content expertise, and other services to effectively support state education agencies and their regional and local constituents in Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah.
Currently, the Region 15 Comprehensive Center is supporting more than a dozen other projects in California as well.
Now, when the current draft, which is responsive to the public comment that we received, was posted, the previous draft from the second field review was kept posted as well so that the members of the board and the public could compare the two versions.
An overview of the revised draft and summary of the edits that were made were provided as attachments two and three to this item.
So what changes were made, might you ask?
The draft of the framework before you today contains numerous recommended edits that respond to the concerns raised by the public in that second field review.
Guidance around meeting the needs of high achieving learners as well as those who need greater assistance has been clarified and strengthened to ensure attention to a range of instructional options, including personalized learning, differentiated instruction, strategic grouping, additional course taking opportunities, and acceleration.
The draft discusses the conditions research has found associated with successful acceleration, as well as strategies for reaching advanced coursework without acceleration.
It also describes means for ensuring students can gain access to advanced level mathematics courses at various junctures throughout their schooling.
The revised draft affirms two high school pathways, that's the traditional and the integrated.
This draft also clarifies the autonomy that local school districts have designing courses and pathways that best meet the needs of their local families.
Citations to research and other sources have been reviewed and updated to address concerns and redundancies raised during that field review.
All right, so those are all the different changes. What are the core ideas then of this framework?
What can an educator, a publishing company, a student, a district level personnel figure out from reading the framework?
Where did we land? So this framework does take the stance that all students are capable of accessing and achieving success in school mathematics in the ways envisioned in the standards originally.
That is, students become inclined and able to consider novel situations arising either within or outside of mathematics through a variety of appropriate mathematical tools.
In turn, successful students can use those tools to understand the situation and when desired to exert their own power to affect that situation.
Thus, mathematical power is not reserved for a few, but available to all.
The framework structures the teaching of the state's rigorous California Common Core State Standards for Mathematics around big ideas.
These big ideas integrate rather than isolate math topics of best practice in high performing countries.
The framework increases focus on developing student mathematical expertise as described in California standards for mathematical practices,
which include the ability to make sense of problems and persevere to solve them, to reason abstractly and quantitatively,
to attend to precision and to apply the mathematics they know to solve problems arising in everyday life, society, and the workplace.
The framework also seeks to connect learning to the real world through authentic examples and use of data, prompting students to ask and answer meaningful questions.
Adding authenticity to lessons helps teachers answer the age-old question for those of us who have been math teachers is, why do I need to learn this?
I've definitely heard that in my teaching career.
The framework allows students to see themselves in the curriculum and in math-related careers by making math instruction culturally relevant and empowering.
The framework stimulates deep learning by sparking student curiosity through lessons that encourage inquiry and problem solving.
The framework integrates and aligns math concepts taught at the middle and high school levels and ensures that all high school pathways are open to all students.
It expands high school math course options to encourage more students to go beyond the minimum course-taking requirements.
The framework encourages students across age spans to become proficient at understanding and using data, a key skill in the 21st century job market.
It helps students identify misleading uses of data and use data to make decisions in their roles as global citizens.
It develops in students a growth mindset versus a fixed mindset, which is in line with the groundbreaking research of Stanford's Dr. Carol Dweck.
The framework instills confidence in learners by dispelling myths around who can and can't learn math,
and it develops instruction and curriculum that is multi-dimensional and employs the use of visuals, graphics, and words in addition to numbers and equations.
So here's kind of the first slide of what the framework looks like.
This is the organization of our framework.
Chapter one is mathematics for all purpose, understanding, and connection.
This is our introductory chapter and sets up the math framework describing how it lays out the curricular and instructional approaches that evidence suggests
will afford all students the opportunities that they need to learn meaningful and rigorous mathematics,
meet state mathematics standards, access pathways to high-level math courses, and achieve success.
Honestly, when I read the first chapter of the framework, having left the classroom for about seven years at that point,
I kind of wanted to go back in the math classroom because this is incredible, the premise behind our mathematics framework and this introduction.
Chapter two talks about teaching for equity and engagement.
It focuses on how teachers can create equitable and engaging mathematics classroom environments,
TK through 12, that support all students and improve mathematics access and outcomes.
Chapter three talks about number sense, and it provides an in-depth discussion of the progression of those big ideas mentioned earlier of number sense
and the growth of number fluency, the ability to use mathematics flexibly, efficiently, and accurately across multiple grade levels.
Chapter four is exploring, discovering, and reasoning with and about mathematics,
which goes deeply into California standards for mathematical practice,
providing that important background for discussing how elementary, middle, and high school teachers teach those big ideas of mathematics.
Chapter five is on mathematical foundations of data science,
which helps educators identify how the common core state standards in mathematics can support PK through 12 students
to develop foundational knowledge and skills for the use of data as a tool for mathematical problem solving.
Chapter six is the first of three grade level chapters, mathematics investigating and connecting transition kindergarten through grade five,
and it discusses how the framework's approach to mathematics teaching unfolds throughout elementary school,
where mathematics is a vibrant, interactive, student-centered endeavor of investigating and connecting the big ideas of mathematics.
I'm super excited that you'll hear from Omowali Moses later a little bit more about that topic.
Students develop an understanding of concepts that include place value, arithmetic operations, fractions, geometric shapes and properties,
and there is going to be a quiz at the end of this.
These concepts are studied with a goal to develop both understanding and fluency,
which requires knowing, efficiently retrieving, and appropriately using facts, procedures, and strategies, including memory.
Chapter seven, mathematics, is the middle school version of chapter six,
which talks about including proportional reasoning, rational numbers, measurement in geometrical and data science scenarios,
all developed through activities that are situated in intriguing, authentic context,
and requires students to build connections among those different ideas.
Chapter eight is the high school equivalent of six and seven,
and that discusses conceptual categories including number and quantity, algebra, functions, modeling, geometry, and statistics, and probability.
It describes the traditional and the integrated mathematics pathways that schools may offer
and the course options that students and their families may choose depending on their interests and their aspirations.
Think about my two sons who are not the same.
It also clarifies the expectations for coursework, leading to different higher education options.
And I guess I didn't advance the slide. I will advance the slide now.
So that's one half of the framework, and it is 900 words, those of you who did read through the whole thing.
So this is this organization structure from chapters nine through 14 and the appendices.
Chapter nine is structuring school experiences for equity and engagement,
and that describes the methods of teaching and coursework designs that can enable all students to be appropriately challenged
and many more to reach advanced mathematics without requiring that all students work on that same mathematics
or be placed in inflexible course sequences that make it difficult for them to move into
or between STEM or non-STEM pathways, if they so choose.
Chapter 10 discusses how to plan and design structured, ongoing, high-quality programs of professional learning
that supports teachers through their careers and as they enact the framework's approach to teaching mathematics.
Chapter 11 talks about the guidance to help educators enrich students' learning of the mathematics content and practice
through the use of technology, which many students were afforded or forced into during the COVID-19 pandemic,
and now that learning can be used to leverage education.
Chapter 12 encourages educators, administrators, and policymakers to focus on assessment that engages students
in continuous improvements by using mastery-based approaches, notably by assessing with rubrics
and using self, peer, and teacher feedback.
Chapter 13 is directed to the developers and creators of instructional materials
and conveys information that's needed to participate in the State Board of Education's instructional materials adoption processes.
All of these chapters were edited after the second field review with most of that significant content changes
coming into chapters 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, and 13.
I'm sure at this point you're probably tired of hearing my voice. It's time to get a change of venue.
So at this time I'd like to invite one of CDE's amazing administrators, Dr. Marla Clayton Johnson,
to conduct a little bit of a deeper dive into these chapters and the changes within.
Thank you, Dr. Torres, and good afternoon all.
You just heard a bit about the organization of the chapters, and now you'll hear a bit more detail about each of the chapters in the framework.
Chapter 1 sets the tone for the entire framework and lays out the approaches that will ensure that students can meet state standards
and access the high-level mathematics that they need for success in college and careers.
To accomplish this, the framework is organized around big ideas in mathematics connected to authentic, real-world contexts
and taught in multidimensional ways that meet varied learning needs.
The recommended edits in this chapter include updates and revisions to the citations included in the chapter,
especially in the area of neuroscience, to ensure that the latest research was accurately and clearly captured.
The chapter was also reorganized for greater clarity, including integrating material from other chapters to more clearly explain
the drivers of investigation, the standards for mathematical practice, and the content connections and how they interact.
Chapter 2 focuses on how teachers can create equitable and engaging mathematics classroom environments
that support all students and improve mathematics access and outcomes.
Additional discussion and research evidence was added to support the five components of instructional design that were introduced in Chapter 1.
These components include planning teaching around big ideas, using opening and engaging tasks, teaching for social justice,
inviting student questions and conjectures, and prioritizing reasoning and justification.
More data evidence on mathematics achievement that highlights inequality in student outcomes was added,
and these inequities justify the instructional changes recommended in the framework.
If a math teacher is looking for guidance on how to reach all students in their classroom, inclusive of struggling and advanced learners,
they would look to Chapter 2 to read about equitable instruction strategies,
such as using open, engaging tasks or inviting student questions and conjectures.
Chapter 3 presents an in-depth discussion of number sense.
This is the first of several chapters that shows how the progression of mathematical concepts occurs across the grade levels.
The chapter shows that number sense can be described as a progression of big ideas,
such as organizing and counting with numbers in transitional kindergarten through grade 2,
extending flexibility with numbers in grades 3 through 5, number line understanding in grades 6 through 8,
and seeing parallels between numbers and functions in grades 9 through 12.
The chapter also emphasizes the use of strategies that are flexible, efficient, and accurate in the growth of number fluency.
The value of activities like math talks and games that encourages students' mental problem solving
and communication as well as playful exploration and skill practice are highlighted.
The edits to this chapter were mainly for clarity and readability, including the addition of an introductory paragraph.
Chapter 4 provides a deep delve into the standards for mathematical practice,
which are an integral part of the state adopted California Common Core state standards for mathematics.
These practice standards are also connected to organizing instruction around the big ideas of mathematics,
which will be developed in the grade span chapters later on.
The chapter uses three interrelated practice standards to demonstrate how teachers can create powerful mathematical experiences
centered on exploring, discovering, and reasoning, enabling students to develop and deepen their skills as they move through the grades.
Edits to this chapter included light editing, as well as the movement of some text as suggested in the public comment.
An introductory paragraph was added, and the why, how, and what of mathematics figure from chapter 1
was included to provide a visual depiction for the reader of what the text describes.
A high school teacher facing the challenge of designing student activities that develop both content standards
and the habits of mind captured in the practice standards can find guidance in chapter 4.
Including a link to a model activity that reinforces structural thinking about the real number system
and also begins to establish a class culture of shared exploration, conjecture, noticing, justifying, and communicating.
Chapter 5 is similar to chapter 3 in that it shows how data science can be embedded through the grade levels starting in kindergarten or even before.
The chapter emphasizes the importance of data science for 21st century global citizens, including making sense of data,
identifying misleading uses of data, and using data to make decisions.
The chapter notes that students who wish to focus extra attention on data science should have an opportunity to pursue advanced courses in high school.
The edits to this chapter are in response to public comments from the second field review,
including structural changes to help readers understand how the foundations of data science
currently reside within existing content standards across grade levels.
While data literacy, the ability to understand and use data to answer questions, is part of data science,
the field of data science also includes advanced mathematics and computational skills
that build upon and go far beyond the content contained in the California mathematics standards.
This chapter also contains a new content that highlights how the use of computational tools
and bigger data sets can support students' understanding of statistics in middle school and high school.
Chapter 6 is the first of the three grade span chapters dealing with mathematics instruction in the elementary grades.
The chapter envisions mathematics in these grade levels as a vibrant, interactive,
student-centered endeavor investigating and connecting the big ideas of mathematics.
Students develop a deep understanding of mathematical concepts as well as fluency in the use of facts and procedures.
Teachers are encouraged to use meaningful mathematics activities that nourish curiosity and develop reasoning skills,
at the same time connecting content and mathematical practices within and across grade levels.
The revisions to this chapter included some reorganization for better flow, coherence, and readability,
as well as standardizing the explanation of the instructional design model that is used in several chapters.
An introductory paragraph was also added.
An elementary teacher who wants to develop a classroom climate of investigation can find strategies for doing so in Chapter 6,
such as encouraging mathematical discourse throughout the day.
How many pencils do we need? How many minutes until lunch?
Having students routinely explain their thinking to others and prompting students with questions that foster reasoning and analysis,
such as, do you think that would happen all the time?
Chapter 7 discusses how the framework's approach to mathematics teaching unfolds throughout middle school.
Building on the foundational understanding of mathematics concepts developed in transitional kindergarten through Grade 5,
middle school's major topics include proportional reasoning, rational numbers, measurement in geometrical and data science scenarios,
all developed through activities that are situated in intriguing, authentic contexts and require students to build connections among ideas.
The critical element of success continues to be piquing students' curiosity and interest through engagement with meaningful and relevant mathematics activities and experiences.
Students' middle school experiences are pivotal in shaping their attitudes towards mathematics and self-perceptions as mathematics learners.
Those experiences, combined with the guidance they receive, determine whether or not students get on a pathway to high-level mathematics,
crucially affecting their mathematics future in high school and beyond.
Revisions in this chapter were mostly editorial and intended to ensure a parallel structure with Chapter 6.
As in Chapter 6, a standardized explanation of the instructional design model was included.
Several subheads were reworded and an introductory paragraph was added.
A middle school teacher who knows that too many middle school students disengage from math can find many examples in Chapter 7 of how to design mathematical investigations that draw students in.
One lesson, for example, gives students opportunities to wonder about the gathering of different kinds of birds at the student's eating area before and after lunchtimes.
Students gather and analyze data to make sense of an intriguing phenomenon in their everyday lives.
Chapter 8 discusses the framework's approach to mathematics teaching in the high school years.
The content standards here are organized in conceptual categories, number and quantity, algebra functions, modeling, geometry, and statistics and probability.
This chapter provides an overview of both the traditional and integrated mathematics pathways that schools can offer.
It also describes third and fourth year high school options for students.
These are intended to reflect their interests and future plans for college and career.
This chapter also clarifies expectations for coursework that leads to various higher education options, including STEM careers.
Chapter 8 also includes examples of pathways in which course content can support the standards for mathematical practice and enable students to hone their skills in mathematical reasoning and communication,
as well as their ability to think critically and creatively as they problem solve.
This kind of teaching requires consideration of many issues in addition to learning goals, including motivation, coherence, students and teachers' cultural and linguistic assets, access and equity, context, and sustainability.
Revisions to this chapter were to address public comments in the second field review.
All references to the mathematics investigating and connecting pathway, which had encouraged more intensive use of data science, were removed.
The framework now encourages the greater use of data in all course pathways.
Additionally, the revision pulled in parts of Appendix A to better explain the course content in each of the two pathways.
The pathways graphic, figure 8.4, was updated to clarify that students should be able to choose from more course offerings during their third and fourth year mathematics classes.
This graphic also clarifies which courses are needed to be ready to pursue a STEM pathway in college.
Other edits removed redundancies and added research citations to support the discussion of several topics, including integration, algebra enrollment, and acceleration.
Information about University of California mathematics course criteria was also checked and clarified.
A high school algebra teacher working to design the kinds of lessons in this framework proposes lessons that engage students in exploring real world problems before teaching methods for solving them.
Confined resources in Chapter 8. For example, the problem of a cylindrical tank being filled from a hose at a constant rate.
How long will it take to fill? Students make some estimates and an exploration that leads them to see the purposes and then developing the necessary mathematics.
Chapter 9 describes methods of teaching and course design that can help all students be challenged and gain access to advanced mathematics.
This does not require that all students work on the same mathematics or be placed in inflexible course sequences that make it difficult to move between STEM or non-STEM pathways.
The goal is to expand access to rigorous mathematics for all students, allowing each student to fully reach their potential.
Based on the feedback received in public comment, the chapter was revised to clarify and ensure accuracy in the discussion of tracking.
Additional explanation and research evidence was added relative to personalization of instruction, one-on-one tutoring, and technology integration.
Some redundant information was also removed from this chapter.
Teachers who recognize the diversity of student achievement and seek ways to ensure that all students receive appropriate support and challenge can find strategies in Chapter 9.
Including personalized learning approaches such as allowing students to work through courses at different paces with advancement based on work that demonstrates their readiness.
Chapter 10 talks about high quality professional learning to support teachers as they implement the framework's approach to teaching mathematics.
It is important that this professional learning be structured and ongoing as teaching for equity and engagement can be quite complex.
The recommendations in this chapter support the framework's emphasis on big ideas and connections and teaching mathematics through carefully designed, intriguing, student-directed investigations.
Many teachers are going to need support to rethink their teaching to align to this approach, requiring new skills and strategies that result in the changes in practice that the framework is advocating.
Similar to the others, this chapter received edits to improve flow and readability that included the relocation of one section for a better fit.
Some rewording of subheadings and the insertion of an introductory paragraph.
Almost done.
Chapter 11 provides guidance to help teachers enrich students' learning of the mathematics content and practice standards through the use of technology.
While there are many exciting technologies today that can support instruction and learning, the framework emphasizes that technology should support and not supplant deep student understanding of mathematical concepts.
To accomplish this, the chapter recommends adopting technology along with changes to teaching that make the technology an integral and sustained component of the instruction.
This will require high quality, ongoing professional learning for teachers.
The chapter also discusses the features of effective distance learning and offers some tips for success.
The changes to this chapter were mostly light editing for clarity and readability, along with the addition of an introductory paragraph.
Chapter 12 addresses assessment.
The focus is on engaging students in continuous improvement efforts by using various forms of assessment to demonstrate mastery.
Assessment should be used with the goal of achieving conceptual understanding, problem solving capacity, and procedural fluency.
This chapter discusses both formative and summative assessment and how they fit into California's comprehensive assessment system.
The edits in this chapter focused on improving clarity and readability, as with the other chapters, an introductory paragraph was also added.
Chapter 13 includes the evaluation criteria that will be used in the next statewide adoption of kindergarten through grade 8 instructional materials,
along with the guidance for local districts on the adoption of high school materials, social content reviews, supplemental materials, and accessible materials.
That guidance includes the provision for instructional materials to be consistent with the California English Language Development Standards.
The edits made to the adoption criteria reflect the framework's emphasis on big ideas, equity, and the instructional shifts described in the other chapters.
Chapter 4 was the glossary, which includes major acronyms and terms that were used in the framework, and minimal edits were made to this chapter.
The appendices include content that supports the other chapters.
Much of the content in Appendix A was moved into Chapter 8.
What remains includes a description of the two high school pathways, traditional and integrated.
This description shows how the content ideas progress from one course to the next in each pathway sequence, with a focus on identifying the math content needed for success in college.
This appendix also contains a discussion of key mathematical ideas to promote student success in introductory university courses in quantitative fields.
This section was originally submitted as public comment.
Appendix B contains all of the references cited in the framework by chapter.
These references were updated to reflect the changes made to the other chapters.
Appendix C is new and contains all of the vignettes referenced in the framework that are no longer than two pages.
They were relocated here to improve the narrative flow of the chapters.
Hyperlinks were included in the chapters where each vignette is mentioned, which take the reader to this appendix C.
Now that you're familiar with the draft 2023 mathematics framework,
I'd like to call upon some experts to share their excitement over the math framework and how the guidance intersects with the great work they do for students.
Joining us virtually is Omowali Moses, the CEO of Math Talk,
who has been doing amazing work on making discovery, discovering mathematics fun and enjoyable for young learners, involving families as well.
Thank you.
Hi, everyone.
You know, thanks, Dr. Hammond, and thanks, Mike, for having me.
So my name is Omowali Moses. I'm the son of Bob and Janet Moses, the father of Johari and Kamara and the founder of Math Talk.
And so if you can move to the next slide.
When I was a kid, my dad founded an organization called the Algebra Project,
and the Algebra Project really sought to make the connection between children learning math and their ability to participate in the economic and political life of this country.
And for me, what that meant as a kid was that I had to do a lot of math, you know, sometimes on weekends,
most of the times when I prefer to be out playing, and math wasn't the funnest thing that I did.
But, you know, I learned that I could be good at it, and I learned that it was important for my community.
And so like many new dads, you know, they want to do things a little bit a little differently with their kids than maybe their parents did with them.
And so my goal as a dad was to actually enjoy learning math with my kids.
And so, you know, when my kids were born, we spent a lot of time doing math, doing the things that we actually love doing.
And so we actually wrote a book about it. Sometimes we do.
And so the book centers on my son and I at breakfast making pancakes and counting stacks of pancakes and exploring kind of all the math that can come out of that experience.
And so, you know, one of the things that I felt was important through the creation of that content was creating something that my kids could see themselves in and so that they could see themselves as math people.
They can see themselves in the content that they're consuming.
But I also wanted to begin to model for other parents how they could really have fun, you know, doing math with their kids together.
And so as the founder of Math Talk, we really looked at taking the work that began with that book, that began with my dad and the work and the algebra project out into the community
and really thinking about, you know, what are ways in which we can utilize our neighborhoods and our community to really engage and explore math in ways that are meaningful.
Next slide, please.
And so I was particularly excited to learn about the California math frameworks, and I think it provides a structure for many of the experiences that I've had with my kids.
You know, as a parent and also experiences that I had with my dad as a product of the algebra project.
And, you know, one of the first things that really stands out to me is this idea that math is for everyone and for all communities.
And so, you know, my dad was really, you know, one of the slogans for the algebra project was this idea of algebra for all, and he would really champion the idea that we needed to raise the mathematical floor for what kids get access to.
You know, I also experienced that with my kids, you know, every kid learns a little bit differently.
And so when my son Joe Hari was in daycare, you know, we would drive to daycare and we begin to count.
And I would say one, he would say two, I would say three, he would say four.
And, you know, we kept doing it and doing it and soon grew up to 10 and 20 and 30 and then 100.
And, you know, every time we get in the car, he's like, daddy, can we count 300?
Can we count the 400?
Can we count the 500?
And it was exhausting at times as a parent, you know, counting up to 500 forward and backwards with your kid.
But he enjoyed doing it and we practiced it and he became good at it.
And I remember looking at the kindergarten standards and the expectation was that, you know,
kids should enter kindergarten being able to count up to 30.
And so I assumed that my daughter was going to be just like him, but she wasn't, you know,
she also loved math, was confident in it, but it took us a little more time to reach 30 and to exceed 30.
But she did it.
And part of the reason why, you know, she did it was that she was also always confident in it
and saw this as something that she could be good at.
And so, you know, I like the idea that this framework is trying to make sure that math is accessible and inclusive.
You know, every kid is going to learn it at their own pace.
But, you know, we need to start with the belief that every kid can learn it, should learn it,
and wants to learn it if we provide those opportunities.
At Math Talk, you know, we ask ourselves some guiding questions.
And so our work really gets off the ground with, you know, what if math was a visible,
vibrant and joyful part of our everyday lives?
What would that look and feel like in your neighborhood and community?
What would that mean for the kids that live there and the adults that care for them?
And so, you know, one of the things that I think this framework encourages is, you know,
a really broad and strategic approach to making math a visible and vibrant and joyful part of their kids' lives.
And, you know, we know when we do that, that kids are going to exceed our expectations of them.
Another thing that stood out to me in the framework is this idea that math is practice
and habits of mind can be developed.
And so, you know, we did math everywhere.
Like we did math on the train, at breakfast, in restaurants.
You know, we talked about it. We kind of built things.
And, you know, as we did that, kind of the kids continued to get better at it.
And they didn't even see themselves as doing math.
You know, they associated, you know, when the kids wanted to do math, you know,
it meant that we were going to go to the restaurant and count the condiments or create stacks of different things.
And so, just their sense of what math was and kind of their ability to relate to it
was much different than when I grew up as a kid.
And so, in relationship to that, this idea of multi-dimensional approach, benefits learning,
I think that's really important.
And I could see how, you know, my kids began to make connections as we explored things
like on a basketball court with, you know, things that we were manipulating
or as we walked and kind of sat at a bus stop and made observations,
you know, as we went into a grocery store and began to look at the different shapes and sizes of things
and things we can count and things that were grouped.
You know, all these things promote the idea that math is everywhere.
And part of the work of math talk, as we see in this picture, is like,
how do we create kind of opportunities for kids to really experience that?
And so, you know, we've thought intentionally about, you know, how do we activate public spaces
and provide playful prompts and playful things for kids to do
so that they begin to see, you know, math is something that's in their world
and that's something that's a part of them.
We've also looked at technology as a way to help kids kind of see and engage with
and deepen kind of the math that's all around them.
And, you know, I think some of the power of the new technology
connects to this idea of content and application being taught as one.
And so with the algebra project, we always, you know,
looked at learning math in a context that was familiar with kids
and learning math through your own everyday language
and thinking about ways in which your experiences can be translated
into more mathematical language and more mathematical ideas
and helping kids make connections between what's familiar to them
and also, you know, these broader big ideas and concepts.
And so next slide, please.
And so for me, you know, I love this idea of math being driven by investigation
and these questions, why, how, and what.
And I just know, you know, with my kids, with my nieces and nephews, with all kids,
like, you know, they love to play the Y game, and they're inherently curious.
And, you know, I've found that, you know, math can be a way for kids
to begin to explore their world and to begin to understand
kind of the world that they live in.
And I think of this as like kids developing a math lens.
And so I remember, you know, with my own kids,
I would initially initiate all the interactions and conversations.
And then it got to a point where, you know, they were the ones that were beginning
to initiate kind of the interactions and conversations.
And so we feel, you know, that's particularly important.
I think another thing that is important is that kids have fun,
you know, particularly in those early years with math,
that math can be learned through games.
And again, it's learned through things that kids enjoy
and kind of through that joy and through that fun, you know,
there's more practice and as people practice things, they get better at it.
And it's an opportunity to continue to connect those things to bigger concepts
and reveal more about the world we live in.
And so I like how the framework really looks at kind of that investigation
and looking at understanding how, you know, the world around us,
but also beginning to use math to think about, you know,
how we might change things or what the future might look like in the world that we live in.
Another piece that has always been important that I see reflected strongly
in the framework is this idea of just content connections.
And so, you know, I remember kind of how I could go from a conversation
about a stack of pancakes to going outside and talking about like a flock of birds
to like a flight of steps and then connecting that to just this broader concept of grouping.
And just saw how as my kids began doing addition in different ways,
began learning how to multiply and divide that those experiences,
that language really created a foundation for deeper mathematical understanding.
And so, you know, we see the how, the why and the what of the framework
is really encouraging learning from everyday language and experiences.
And turning that into connecting that to mathematical ideas
and more formal mathematical language that has real world applications.
Next slide, please.
And so, you know, my hope is that the framework can be used
to positively change relationships children and families and educators
have with mathematics in a positive way and to support the creation
of a culture of learning math in our communities.
And so, you know, for children, I think, you know, they all can learn math.
They all want to learn math.
There's no anxiety around it.
You just got to turn them on to it.
And when you do kind of disguise the limit, I think for families,
what was important for me was that this became something that we can do together.
And so it became a way for us as a family to have fun together
and to also explore kind of the neighborhood and the community together.
I think also, you know, for educators, we see kind of the ideas in the framework,
you know, building kind of the confidence and the capacity for teachers to bring math to life
in ways that are really meaningful to students and to communities.
And so we've had experiences both in Cambridge and in Boston
on a math trail that we created, bringing teachers,
bringing pre-service teachers kind of out into the neighborhoods
and communities that their students live in.
And it was really eye-opening for them to begin to see how the community that the kids live in
and how the kids' lives can really be a resource for mathematics learning.
And so, you know, I think the framework encourages those types of experiences.
Next slide, please.
Yeah, so I guess, you know, the last thing I'll say is, you know, as a parent,
I'm excited about how the framework can inspire kids to love math
in the same way that my kids develop the deep love for math.
I'm excited to see how the framework can really support families to do math together
and for folks to begin to see math as something that can be a social thing
and not just something that we do as individuals.
And then as the founder of Math Talk, you know, I think the framework represents an opportunity
for partnership that will encourage the support of educators in bridging learning math in school
and the community and at home.
Thank you.
Hopefully, you can hear that resounding applause for you, Omo.
Thank you so much for the exciting presentation showing how the guidance
and the mathematics framework can really be a resource for you.
Thank you so much for the exciting presentation showing how the guidance
and the mathematics framework has already been applied in your organization.
So far, we've started with the great value that the framework will provide to educators
and students, discussed the framework's development process,
and heard a demonstration of how educators may actively use this incredible piece of guidance.
Now I'd like to invite Dr. Kendall Brown,
Executive Director of the California Mathematics Project,
to speak on key elements of the mathematics framework
and why it's good for California students.
President Darling-Hammond and the board, good afternoon.
My name is Kendall Brown.
I was a middle and high school mathematics teacher
in the Los Angeles Unified School District for over 10 years
where I taught everything.
Thank you.
Everything from pre-algebra to pre-calculus.
If you can go to the next slide.
I'm also the Executive Director of the California Mathematics Project,
which I'll refer to as CMP return.
And we are one of nine subject matter projects.
You can hit return again.
The California Mathematics Project's regional sites are housed at UC and CSU campuses,
and we bring together mathematicians, mathematics educators,
and classroom teacher leaders to provide professional and leadership development
for K-12 teachers of mathematics and continue to return.
We also have a couple of mandates,
and one of them is to implement the California Mathematics Framework and Standards,
and we're also mandated to work in low-performing schools and districts.
Given CMP's mandates, I'm honored to speak in support of the current draft
of the California Mathematics Framework,
and in my remarks today I'd like to specifically address chapters two, nine, and five in that order.
Next slide.
So I appreciate that the framework explicitly addresses equity.
Chapter two does a great job of explaining the why of equity and engagement.
The chapter acknowledges the problem by using standardized test scores and graduation rates
to illustrate the disparities with respect to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.
Hit return.
The chapter also provides actions that teachers can take to address the disparities.
Strategies like using assets-based perspectives, active learning,
culturally relevant and responsive teaching,
and the chapter also illustrates the five components of equitable teaching.
You can hit return.
There are also wonderful vignettes and snapshots that are a part of this chapter
that help to illuminate those specific teaching practices.
And I also appreciate the connections, you can hit return,
to the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics Principles to Action,
a nationwide document that really helps to illuminate the kinds of teaching practices
that are needed to support equity and engagement.
Next slide.
For too many students, low-income students of color,
they are only exposed to low-level and skill-based instruction.
Chapter nine advocates access to rigorous mathematics instruction for all students to return.
The chapter also addresses this issue of flexible grouping structures
in the garden through high school.
As a classroom teacher, I found that some students who may have excelled with number and operations
might have struggled with geometry and measurement,
or students who understood algebraic thinking also had difficulty with probability concepts.
For those reasons and many others, it's important that teachers think flexibly
about when and how they group students to avoid stigmatizing or labeling students
in ways that negatively impacts their math identities as they go through school.
Return.
The chapter nine also provides strategies for teaching to diverse students,
and hit return, and it also addresses multidimensional teaching,
which includes lecture, investigation and exploration, as well as open-ended tasks.
And it also provides organizations like mine with a direction.
In addition to chapter 10, I think this chapter also helps to think about the direction
for professional learning that's going to be needed to support the framework.
So you can hit return.
Lastly, I'd like to talk about chapter five, which addresses the issue of data science.
So why data science?
Data science is a multidisciplinary approach that combines principles and practices
from the fields of mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer engineering
to analyze large amounts of data.
The high demand for data science has been linked to the rise of big data
and its increasing importance to businesses and other organizations.
You'd be hard pressed to find an organization, a government entity,
a business that doesn't use large data, right?
Data scientists earn an average salary of about $110,000 in the United States.
And according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,
data scientists' occupations are expected to grow by 36% in the next 10 years,
much faster than average.
Now, over the last 10 or more years, a variety of data science courses
have been implemented in California,
and I'd like to share the results of analyses of the impact of some of these courses.
And so in 2016, the California Department of Education funded
the California Math Readiness Challenge Initiative
to fund the creation and implementation of five senior-level mathematics courses.
I worked with one of the funded projects
to implement the Introduction to Data Science course,
which I'll refer to as IDS,
in a small high school district in Southern California.
At least one section of IDS was taught
at each of the three high schools in the district in return.
So the name of our grant was called the College Access Through Data Science,
and the evaluators studied the relationship between participation in IDS
and college readiness through examination of the extent to which math courses,
math course grades of IDS students met district graduation
and admission requirements to the California State University
and the University of California.
So what they found was that more than two-thirds of all students
earned a grade of C or better in their IDS course.
Students' GPAs for IDS courses were significantly higher
than their GPAs for other math courses.
Almost all students met district graduation requirements,
and more than three-quarters of students additionally met
UC and CSU admission requirements.
For almost a quarter of students, their participation in IDS
is an essential component to their meeting the UC admission requirements return.
Next, I'd like to share the results from a report
by the Policy Analysis for California Education, or PACE.
This report highlights the efforts of six partnerships,
which included those funded by the California Math Readiness Challenge Initiative
to implement advanced, innovative mathematics courses designed for high school seniors.
Quantitative analysis indicates that enrollment in advanced,
innovative math courses increases the likelihoods that students will complete
course requirements for California State University
or University of California eligibility by 3 to 10 percentage points,
and in some cases improves high school math grades return.
In a report by the Los Angeles Educational Research Institute at UCLA,
this report studied the implementation of two alternative math courses
implemented in the Los Angeles Unified School District,
Transition to College Mathematics and Statistics, and IDS.
Compared to students who took pre-calculus,
students who were otherwise similar at the end of 11th grade but took IDS
earned slightly higher GPAs.
The study found no statistically significant difference in college enrollment
for similar students who took IDS instead of pre-calculus return.
And then lastly, a study funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
and conducted by the Stanford Graduate School of Education
details the findings of a year-long study of students taking a data science course
in five high schools across four districts in California.
The study found that students who took the high school data science course
were more racially and socioeconomically diverse
than is typical of advanced mathematics courses,
that the students scored at significantly higher levels
on a test of algebra with data than students in Algebra II classes,
that the students enrolled in significantly more mathematics courses
than comparable students not taking data science,
and that the students reported that their learning in the data science course
was more meaningful and relevant than in previous math courses.
So I'll end by just suggesting that what we don't have is data
about post-secondary course-taking and degree attainment
of students who've taken data science.
And so that would be a great study for CSU, UC, and CDE to fund.
And with that, I will return the floor back to Mike.
Thank you, Dr. Brown.
All right, thank you so much, Dr. Brown, for sharing the emphasis
on the good work of the framework related to equity for all students
and data science.
Our final guest speaker today is Dr. Adrian Mims,
the founder of the Calculus Project,
to share about the intersection of the math framework
and the work that he does to benefit high school students.
Dr. Adrian Mims will be joining us virtually today.
Good afternoon, everyone.
Thank you, Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond,
for inviting me to speak to everyone today to talk about the work
that's very dear to me, the Calculus Project,
and how the components that we implement in school districts
in Massachusetts, in Florida, and now Texas,
aligns with the framework that you have in California.
First slide, please.
I want to start by just talking about, you know,
how it is personal for me by telling you a little bit about myself.
I grew up in South Carolina.
I attended James F. Burns High School,
and there were three tracks in my high school.
The first track was you'd go through high school,
and you'd get a high school diploma,
and those students usually would go work in a textile mill,
or they'd go into the military.
The next track was a vocational track,
where you'd go through high school half of the day,
and then the remaining part of the day you'd go to Artie Anderson,
which is a vocational school to learn a trade.
The next track, which is the track that I was in,
is the college prep track,
which was supposed to prepare you for college,
and I traveled on that track from 9th grade all the way to 12th grade
with three other black students.
Unfortunately for me, it didn't prepare me well for college.
I went to the University of South Carolina,
and I majored in electrical engineering.
What I didn't do in high school that I wish I had done was take calculus,
and so when I started at the University of South Carolina,
my freshman year went okay.
Second year, sophomore year, was a lot more difficult,
and I learned two things.
One, my high school didn't prepare me well,
but two, I didn't know how to study, so I was fortunate.
I ended up changing my major from electrical engineering to mathematics.
I found a gentleman there from Togo
who was there getting his doctorate in mathematics in Kofi Fademba,
who's now a professor at University of South Carolina Aiken,
who saw me struggling in the study lounge and offered to tutor me.
So I credit him for my graduating from the University of South Carolina
with a degree in mathematics within five years because I changed my major so late.
So I just wanted to share that because I think that story still exists for too many students,
and the role of the calculus project is to really change that narrative.
The other thing about the calculus project is my own children participate in it,
and I know from personal experience with my son who just graduated from Bridgewater State,
I always say proof that God has a sense of humor.
My son hates math, and I love it.
But I made him begrudgingly to tell him he had to participate in the calculus project, and he did.
But he thanked me later because the first thing that he had to do
when he went to Bridgewater State was take a test called an acuplacer
that would determine whether he'd have to take a remedial math course or not.
And I definitely credit, and he does too, the fact that he took calculus,
that he successfully passed that class, unlike so many other students,
and did not have to take a remedial math course, which, by the way,
students usually have to pay for out of pocket, and those credits do not go towards their graduation.
So with the calculus project, one of the things that we do,
we prepare students for access and overcoming the barriers that unfortunately still exist today.
The calculus project was born out of my dissertation,
Improving African American Achievement in Geometry Honors.
I worked at Brookline High School for 19 years in various roles.
I was a math teacher, summer school director, associate dean, and dean of students.
And after writing my dissertation that created the calculus project,
I left in 2013 to expand the program nationally.
And so what I'm going to do in the next couple of slides
is just to talk about the components of the calculus project, which are all supported by research.
The first five components are student-facing components,
and the last two components are components that we added to the calculus project for our relaunch this year
to really address the drop in scores due to summer learning loss,
but more importantly, the impact that COVID had on student learning over the past couple of years.
We needed to find ways to make sure that the program and the components were implemented with fidelity
and that we would engage in all the three major stakeholder groups in earnest in a way that can promote student achievement.
Next slide, please.
I really define the calculus project as grassroots because it's really all about engaging the three major stakeholder groups
that are vital for student success in mathematics.
And the three major stakeholder groups are the students, the parents, and the educators.
And with the calculus project, what we do when we work with districts,
we help districts identify a calculus project coordinator, a person who's internal.
This person doesn't necessarily have to have a degree in mathematics.
This person is someone who needs to be respected in the district and someone who has great leadership skills.
For us, closing the achievement gap is just as much about leadership as it is about math curriculum.
And so once that person is identified, we then build a math team around that person.
We also conduct the needs assessment of the district to identify the strengths of the district,
but also identify the areas that need greater support.
And from those findings, we actually develop a strategic plan collaboratively with leaders in the district.
And then we roll the program out gradually.
And it usually takes about five to six years for full implementation, depending on if we start with rising seventh graders or rising eighth graders.
So with the first component of the calculus project, that is the summer academy.
So with the summer academy, the purpose of that is to make sure that we mitigate summer learning loss.
So now we have to deal with not only summer learning loss, but also the impact that the pandemic has had on student learning.
And so what we do, we make sure that students have a minimum of 60 hours of learning during the summer.
And it's not all just seat time.
We show students how the math is applied in the real world.
Here in Boston, we have multiple partnerships at MIT and Harvard.
We take students to Harvard Medical School.
They get these really cool lab coats and they can, you know, and they take them home, too.
And they get to see how math is applied in the real world.
And we also take them to MIT where they learn about the work of Dr.
Larry Sass and what he does with 3D printing.
And in addition to that, there is seat time.
And when students are in the classroom, we teach them the math ahead of time.
It's pre-teaching to accelerate their learning, but also teaching the students how to work collaboratively in groups so that they can support one another.
Our sequence of courses is pre-teaching rising eighth graders algebra, rising ninth graders geometry and algebra 2, rising 10th graders algebra 2 and trigonometry,
rising 11th graders pre-calculus, and rising 12th graders AP calculus.
And so what we want to do is retain those students and we retain a significant percentage of those students and have them come year after year after year.
I will say that one of the challenges of doing this is that a lot of the students that participate in the program are middle class and low income students.
So when they become old enough to work, now they have to make the decision between participating in our program and working.
So we've addressed that a couple of ways.
One way we've developed a virtual model of the program so that students can continue to work, but we can still accelerate their learning during the summer.
But also we've partnered with companies like John Hancock Financial Services and the mayor's office to use funds to pay students to learn math and to teach younger students math.
And that's part of the peer teaching component, which I will discuss in a few minutes.
But the summer academy, once students complete the summer academy, the goal is to make sure that those students remain in an advanced and honors level course together as a cohort.
So we populate an honors or an honors or an advanced level math course with about 40 to 50% of those students being in the capitalist project so that they can hone those skills of collaboration.
But also some of the habits that we've worked with them to develop that successful students possess.
We want students to build agency and own their learning.
And the best way to do that is to make sure that they have a community and a cohort and they have a great sense of belonging.
The academic center is another opportunity for students to hone those skills of collaboration.
The academic center is staffed by teachers in the high school to help facilitate the tutoring and the learning.
It's not one-to-one tutoring.
If you were to walk into an academic center in a capitalist project district, you would see students at tables working in teams to complete homework assignments, to study for quizzes and tests, to make corrections on quizzes and tests.
And the teachers walking around to facilitate that.
And so we plant that seed during the summer.
And that's our goal to make sure that that is nurtured during the school year in the academic center and by putting the students in cohorts in these honor and advanced level courses.
And as the framework states, you know, for the summer academy about summer sessions, about the importance of that, but also for the academic center by deploying one-on-one or small group tutoring, here students are working together to support one another.
This isn't really rocket science, you know, time is a precious commodity.
So we're extending that into the summer.
And when you think about the reason why the school year is 180 days, it's based off of the agrarian calendar.
And when was the last time you ever saw a kid harvest anything, right?
I can't even get my son to cut the grass.
But that's very important that we utilize that time to mitigate the summer learning loss.
The next component I'd already mentioned about the student cohorts, making sure that those students stay together during the school year so that they can build community and support one another.
The peer teaching component is another important part.
And actually that wasn't an original component of the calculus project that actually evolved over time because we really wanted to keep students engaged.
It's probably one of our best components, I'll say, simply because we've been doing this work since 2009.
And some of our peer teachers are now actually math teachers.
And some of them have gone into to teach physics as well.
And so what we wanted to do was actually step this up a little bit.
So one of the things that we started doing a few years ago, we took our strongest students and signed them up to take the Massachusetts test for educators licensure here in Massachusetts.
Anyone can sign up to take the test.
So we signed some students to take the subject test for middle school math certification and for high school math certification.
We just thought it'd be really cool.
Of course, you know, the kids who passed it, they're not certified to teach because you have to pass a communication literacy and you have to also have a college degree.
But it's a very tough test.
And so to be able to pass that test while you're in high school, it looks good on your college application, and it really shows that you know math really well.
So planting the seed early with students through our peer teacher program has really led to them understanding the joy of mathematics, but also it helped them to build their confidence and deepen their knowledge.
And for the students they're teaching, it had a profound impact on them because now they see young people who are a little bit older who look like them and share their same language or share their same culture be good in math.
And it's a great way for these students to earn a living to help help out their families.
And so we're looking to ramp that up even more as we expand the work.
The last component is the pride curriculum.
The last student face component is the pride curriculum.
The pride curriculum is all about changing the hearts and minds of students.
We want students to envision themselves as STEM people.
And so what we do, we teach them about the contributions that STEM professionals of color have made so that they can help develop so that they can develop a stronger math and science identity.
But it also provides them with a blueprint for what it takes for them to be successful.
It takes resilience, but also it helps them to understand that failure is part of the process to become successful.
We have an acronym for fail first attempt and learning.
So the pride curriculum is really all about building their resilience and helping students to understand that failing is part of the process.
And they learn that by, you know, learning about these people who've made significant contributions who look just like them.
The last two components are the components that we implemented in the relaunch just to make sure that the previous components that I mentioned are being implemented with fidelity.
We wanted to develop make this more grassroots and make sure that everyone had a seat at the table.
And so we created the parent advisory council.
So all of the districts we this year we just formed a consortium of calculus project districts and they have to implement these additional components so that we can turn these performance scores around.
So with the parent advisory council is comprised of students, parents and educators, they will analyze data.
They'll also look at some of the policies and practices because we do know that some of these policies and practices that exist in schools are really part of the problem and not part of the solution.
So we work collaboratively with school districts.
We provide coaching professional development so that we can look at some of these policies and practices such as tracking doubling kids up on math courses and course recommendation criteria to really create more flexibility so that we can have upward mobility.
So students can access these 100 advanced level courses.
And so making sure that parents know what course their child is supposed to be in and what particular grade and enlisting them as allies is very, very important.
It's vital to student success and the parent advisory council is there to ensure that that happens.
And the last component is we recognize that teachers, they need professional development.
It needs to be ongoing, not only just professional development, but really breaking it down to curriculum development.
Ever since the adoption of Common Core, one of the things that has happened is that a lot of districts have interpreted what Common Core means in their own way.
And by doing so, a lot of districts have struggled with vertical alignment of their courses.
What's most important to teach to make sure that, you know, we're maximizing the time.
So that's one of the things we do.
We help districts with their vertical alignment of their courses, but also just with professional development because we recognize that we have to change the hearts and minds of teachers, too.
They need to know that every student who is in front of them is a mathematician and they need to think about ways of differentiating instruction as well as differentiating assessment.
And so that's one of the that's actually the last component.
And if you look at the slide, we have three columns.
We have the framework, parts of the framework that aligns with our components.
And then the last column outlines our impact.
And so I will stop my presentation at this time.
I think I'm the last one, so I don't want to be in between anyone else in their dinner.
So thank you for allowing me to share with you the calculus project and how the components that we implemented school districts align with the framework.
Thank you so much, Dr. Mims, for your presentation on the calculus project and and that intersection of the framework related to the work that you do with the calculus project.
So we're going to move on in the presentation.
Just a couple more slides, I promise.
And then you'll get that exit ticket.
The public comment received since we've posted the math framework is the math framework posted on June 26th of 2023.
The State Board of Education had received more than 500 public comments from posting it up to noon of July 7th.
And as a result, there are some additional recommended edits that staff have to to help improve the mathematics framework.
As Ellen mentioned, it's California's process to post something, receive public comment and make an even better project product.
It's an iterative process.
A review of those public comments yielded some of these recommended edits.
You've received an addendum to this particular item, and the addendum to this item includes those recommended edits for State Board of Education to consider and to take action on the mathematics framework.
These recommended edits are based on public comments received on this latest posted draft.
You'll note that on the attachment to the addendum, it uses differential markup.
You'll note that the differential markup means that addition gives those symbols begin, add, underline, end, add, while a deletion, a proposed deletion, are marked as begin delete, a strike through, and then end delete.
The purpose of that is since it is posted, it is 508 accessible.
I have a few categorizations of those edits.
One is to ensure that the framework language is up to date and accurately reflects the most recent decisions related to the UC system.
To ensure clarity throughout including clarifying language about mathematics fundamentals, essential concepts, support for all learners, and middle and high school course options, and then technical edits related to grammar, punctuation, spelling, language choice, and style guidelines.
So what's next for the mathematics framework?
So should you approve the recommendations that CDE has put forth before you, we have begun planning for a rollout of the mathematics framework.
While I do not have specific dates or events to report to at this time, we'll be working with our organizational partners, including my co-presenters here today, to develop orientation sessions and professional development activities related to the new framework.
We will share more information about these events through our partners and our various listservs when we have more details.
Preparatory work is also underway on the next statewide adoption of kindergarten through grade eight instructional materials in mathematics.
The evaluation criteria for that adoption is included in the framework and is part of your action today.
A detailed schedule of events for the adoption will come to you for approval sometime early next year.
Once the framework is adopted, the CDE will initiate the professional editing and design process through the CDE press.
The end result will be a PDF document that will be posted on the CDE's website.
However, as soon as the board acts today, we will work to make any revisions that are requested and post updated Word files with those changes that will remain available until the PDF is ready.
And due to the size of the framework, there are no plans to publish a hard copy version of the framework at this time.
So to conclude the recommended action, once again, we're asking that the board adopt the draft mathematics framework that includes the recommended revisions proposed in response to public feedback.
Any additional edits that you would like to see made should be included in your motion today.
We also ask that you delegate authority to State Board of Education and CDE staff to make any necessary revisions, including any needed for clarity and accuracy as the document is professionally edited and prepared for publication.
So that concludes this marathon of a presentation.
I'm happy to answer any questions at the appropriate time.
Thank you so much, Dr. Torres, not only for this marathon presentation, but for all the marathon work to get us here.
I want to be respectful of the time of our commenters who are in the room and getting ready to be on the phone.
I think we should go ahead and put up the public comment slide.
But I also want to give them our full attention and we've been sitting for over a couple of hours.
So I think we should take just a five minute stretch break if you need to get a cup of coffee or whatever, move your body.
We will start promptly if we can in five minutes and we will start with the people who are here for public comment in the room.
Public comment slide up please on the television.
Thank you.
And before public comment, we always turn to our liaisons for a brief comment and we will do that.
Then we will take public comment in the room.
Then we'll take public comment on the phone.
Those who want to call in on the phone should use the dial-in number and the participant access codes shown on this slide.
And I'm going to first turn to Vice President Glover-Woods who has been a liaison to the instructional quality commission for her brief comments.
And then I'll make a few and then we'll turn to comments.
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond.
And much thanks and gratitude to everyone who has been involved with bringing the mathematics framework to this point.
The IQC commissioners and CDE staff as well as the public that has been so instrumental in helping to shape this framework over a four-year period, two of those years, which has been public comment.
So I want to start my comments with just a huge thank you to all of you.
And one of the things that I do realize and as I share with the board is that at the heart of every comment and at the heart of every piece of feedback that has been received throughout this process, and I would say even that we will receive today, children are at the heart of that matter.
And everybody wants to be sure that all of our students in California are able to be strong in mathematics content and that they're able to receive the level of instruction that is necessary for them to realize what life will be beyond high school.
This particular framework, this particular framework strikes to do that.
And let me say in our framework, what we see is support for students who might have challenges in mathematics and may need additional support, scaffolding, extended instruction.
We also see for our students who are the highest achievers in mathematics, who don't meet with some of those same challenges, that their schools and districts can ensure and should ensure that they have courses that allow for them to excel to those highest levels of advanced mathematics through high school.
The document we have is guidance and every local school district has and should take that opportunity to design the coursework, instruction and pathways that are most relevant to the students they serve in their community.
And my encouragement today and beyond is for everyone at that local level to take a look at the data, lead with your data, not just the aggregate data, but the disaggregated data to determine what mathematics instruction, what courses and what pathways need to be available to students.
One last statement I'll make and then again, we'll turn it back over to you, President Darling-Hammond.
We have heard multiple times the percentage of students that have met or exceeded math proficiency standards based on the 2022 assessment.
I believe that number might be 33 percent.
And as we look at the data, we even see our most highest performing student group in the state of California, less than 70 percent have met or exceeded mathematics proficiency per that assessment.
So what that is telling us is that we need to ensure that our teachers have the information in front of them to be able to support this diverse group of learners they are indeed going to have in their classroom.
And what's most important beyond this framework is going to be the professional development, the determination of the instructional materials that will support instruction.
That's where the rubber is really going to meet the road.
And I'm encouraged to hear our public comment today and our board discussion as we move forward on this very, very important item.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
We've waited a long time for this framework to reach us.
And I also want to thank the CDE staff, IQC, state board staff, especially Dr. Mike Torres for getting us along this path and all of those who are involved in the writing, advising, reviewing of the document and all the people who took time to make comments along the way.
And we'll make time this afternoon to do that.
I think it's been more than a couple thousand people altogether.
As we prepared for this meeting, I've had the opportunity to review the new document more than once and the formal comments as well as the informal comments and statements that are being made about it.
It is great to see how much passion many people have about math.
I personally love mathematics and I appreciate the kind of quotes in the framework about a society without mathematics.
Affection is like a city without concerts, parks or museums that we really need for mathematics to be part of everyone's lives and something that we approach not with math phobia, not with math anxiety, but with math enthusiasm.
The framework response is imperative and many people care deeply about it.
But we also know that the United States has not been teaching math effectively or equitably.
We are one of the lower achieving countries on PISA, below 30 other nations and well below the international average on PISA and it's declined since 2000 and California is below the national average in its achievement in mathematics.
So this is an area of great need and change is imperative.
The same old same old will not get us to a new place.
It's also obvious that some folks who have developed views about the framework have not read it closely.
And there are many kinds of misinformation that I've seen circulating and I want to just address three areas where those of you who have not read all 900 pages twice or three times may have missed something.
The first is the view that the framework would prevent students from getting to advanced mathematics by eliminating or discouraging students from starting the normal high school sequence.
Algebra one or math one in eighth grade so as to get to calculus in the traditional course sequence by 12th grade.
On the contrary, this draft of the framework explicitly encourages students who are ready to accelerate to do so and schools to support them in doing so.
Chapter eight notes that the CCSSM courses introduce algebra to all students in the normal sequence by eighth grade and that with proper preparation some students will be ready to accelerate to high school algebra one or math one at that time.
The draft does note that an earlier California attempt to throw all California students into algebra one in eighth grade was not successful for all students.
And this is partly a result of lack of planning for curricular readiness.
And the framework goes on to describe a more successful strategy to accelerate all students based on a study over six cohorts of students in a in a New York school.
And it describes how that set of practices, including designing a coherent curriculum from sixth to eighth grade for those students, providing alternate day support classes, workshops to assist students who needed extra help, giving teachers professional development, giving them common planning period so that they could develop the course together.
Allowed an entire large diverse high school to accelerate everyone successfully.
So we are interested in success for those who accelerate and for schools to take into account the strategies that would work.
And the chapter nine the framework discusses at length how schools could offer multiple junctures for acceleration not only at eighth grade, but throughout high school so that there are multiple ways to get to higher level math.
It discusses on page 10 of chapter nine lines 230 and following if people want to find it multiple ways it says so that students may accelerate at any time during middle or high school.
Many of the kinds of strategies that Dr. Mims just talked about are described in that chapter, including opportunities for students to not be stuck in a tracking system that has only one pace and one destination, which is one of the problems with the traditional tracking that we've had, which track many people out of the possibility of getting to higher order math.
But including things like pursuing additional study options at various junctures, providing additional support and expanded learning time with co-requisite courses, things like the Algebra Project and the Calculus Project.
Also providing opportunities for personalized instruction for intensive tutoring.
And we have a suggestion in the framework that the board consider creating a math working group to discuss and clarify possible high school pathways that would allow students who start with algebra math one and ninth grade also to get to calculus by the end of high school.
I will say that the framework does also review what high achieving countries do in math.
Most of them offer an integrated sequence of math one, two, and three, and they go to calculus.
For those who want that path and they sometimes specialize and differentiate at that point, my point is we should be thinking about how we get most students to higher order math.
Not only those who in early elementary school are already obviously on a path.
The old way the status quo was to place students in these separate unbearing tracks from early elementary school with some leading to advanced math and others on a train track that had its destination that would be other than that.
Those placed in the lower tracks were often disproportionately have often been disproportionately English learners.
First the English learners, students of historically marginalized groups, African American, Native American, Latinx, Pacific Islander, those who immigrated at a later time in their school career, those who had not had the benefit of preschool.
What we want is not a single destination, but a flexible path set of pathways to get students to higher order math.
The second area is that some commentators mostly outside of California who seem to see the world through a polarized math war lens have that pits investigation and inquiry against solid learning of math facts in ways that assure fluency and proficiency.
I have claimed that the framework would abandon math facts for young students in favor of what they characterize as inquiry and either or characterization, you know, that this is not accurate in the framework.
And I would encourage a close reading of chapter six for those who are concerned about that, which covers TK through five.
TK through five, it makes clear how teachers can follow the common core state standards in mathematics for helping students gain fluency and learn standard algorithms throughout those grades.
For example, in chapter six, page 23, line 533, it talks about how by second grade students should use their understanding of addition to solve problems within a thousand and develop, discuss and use efficient, accurate and generalizable methods to compute sums and differences of whole numbers.
Students in the primary grades become proficient in addition and subtraction using methods that make sense to them.
This proficiency helps them prepare for fluency defined here as not using any physical meaning making supports and using a standard algorithm with fluency by grade level four.
And so I looked at the chapter wondering what this came from. Indeed, the chapter references means for developing fluency 28 times, means for teaching the use of standard algorithms 43 times, mentions investigation about that same number of times, 47 times.
So there's quite a balance between this idea of inquiry and developing the both end approach to math that is meaningful, engaging, deeply understood and efficient and readily accessible.
There's further clarification in the addendum about some language there that would make that crystal clear.
The third area and the final area that I want to address is that the framework encourages students to take courses in high school that might not prepare them adequately or support their aspirations to enter a STEM career.
And that's a very important thing. We want truth in advertising. We want students to know how to get to those careers.
In particular, there were concerns about students should be clear that the pathway to majors in STEM should continue to include preparation for calculus.
This concern arose because of the options that have been encouraged by CSU and USC and their recent policies to get more students to take more math past the two year requirement.
And they've approved a range of courses for area C in the A through G requirements, of which some were flagged as meeting a standard of advanced mathematics for third and fourth years of math.
The framework does discuss these options and displays them in figure 8.4.
For clarity, the text in the figure note that courses other than Algebra 2 or Math 3 on the pathways could take students off the pathway to calculus that is expected for STEM careers.
And so we want to be sure that people, if they're making choices that fulfill different other aspirations, know that that is the case.
The framework also describes lots of pathways to calculus at many junctures, as we just discussed, as Dr. Mim referenced.
And it recognizes that these options can support math taking for those who would otherwise drop math at 10th grade.
Remember that the high school requirement in California for math is only two years.
And one of the interests that the CSU and the UC and others have had is to get kids to take third and fourth years of mathematics.
And some of those courses and their examples in Chapter 8 on page 33 and 34 of students who have various aspirations and want to take financial algebra, statistics, programming courses and other courses and so on.
So quite a bit of attention has focused on the UC decision to authorize data science as an area C course that could validate Algebra 2.
And questions have been raised within the UC system.
The board of, what does board stand for, the UC committee that determines these things decided to look at this question and had a meeting on Friday, July 7th.
So it was just last Friday.
And sent us comments indicating that there would be further evaluation of whether all data science courses meet the standards for advanced mathematics.
And our addendum incorporates their comments.
We want to be sure to accurately represent the policy of the UC CSU system, even as it may be being adjusted.
So that is taken into account and there is no place in the framework that identifies data science as a course that is validating Algebra 2.
We did ask for clarification of the exact policy decisions that were made on the 7th, even after that comment was filed.
And we got this statement that I'll just read to you so that you know what the latest information is.
It is from the executive director of the Academic Senate.
It says at the University of California and across higher education, there's always a debate over curriculum and pedagogy amongst faculty on Friday, July 7th.
The Board of Admissions and Relations with Schools, BORES, continued an ongoing dialogue on what advanced mathematics courses may satisfy the math requirement for undergraduate admission.
There's been continued discussion about the adequacy of a small number of data science courses, not data science broadly, in the context of our system wide student preparedness expectations.
During the Friday meeting, BORES voted to establish a working group to examine the criteria that determine whether a course is considered advanced math and to draft a charge for their undertaking over the coming months.
As BORES work group begins forming and developing its charge, the university will still recognize the existing advanced math courses approved to fulfill the subject requirement, including pre-calculus, linear algebra, trigonometry, statistics, discrete math, and courses in data science for this year's applicants to the university.
We are grateful to BORES, the Academic Senate, and all of our faculty for their continued commitment to our students' academic preparedness and intellectual growth.
And we are clear with our higher ed colleagues that the framework will ultimately accurately portray their decisions in that process.
So I wanted to be sure that we had that information as we go into the public comment period.
I think one of the things that we need to be clear about is that even as we know the status quo is not adequate, at the same time we have to be careful and deliberate about ensuring rigor.
And that this is equity for excellence, not in lieu of excellence.
And I think the framework has striven to make that clear in multiple ways.
And with that, we'll, I think, open the floor for public comment.
I would say do we have commenters in the room, but I think I know the answer to that question.
Sorry about that. We have 11 people in the room signed up for public comment.
I'll call the first six, and we would appreciate it if you would line up in the order you're called in in the back of the room for the microphone.
So Yolanda Beckels, Jelani Nelson, Gabriella Mitchell, Bethel Astashweshu, and Ido Mayas-Vicre, and Will Parrish.
Please line up. You each have one minute.
My name is Yolanda Beckels. I'm executive director of the Knowledge Shop, a nonprofit based in South Los Angeles, working with over 200 black and brown families in STEM and stream proficiency for over eight years.
I'm also the chair of the Family Math Advisory Committee, which has 14 leading math experts across the state of California who join me on a monthly basis.
The revisions to the framework offer a better way to teach math to the students mentioned before.
This framework has taken four years to get to this stage.
Because of the work we do with students after school and during vacation, we understand and see why there must be a robust way to teach particularly black children in mathematics.
The framework authors have listened to the voices of family and engagement experts like myself and others and have incorporated our recommendations.
They have also worked closely with math respected organizations across the state.
As a black mother of five children, of which two are high achieving children in STEM, my daughter is an astrophysicist, and my son, who's here filming me right now, is my tech director, both graduated from LAUSD.
Well, everyone's promoting their children, why not me?
Both graduated from LAUSD and have masters and degrees in STEM.
We want to see other black children have this opportunity, and we support the board in approving the math framework.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, all.
My name is Jelani Nelson.
I'm a professor and incoming chair of computer science at UC Berkeley.
I'm also founder and president of a nonprofit that does high school outreach and computer science education, for which I was awarded this year's Eugene Lawler Award, the highest international award for humanitarian contributions in computer science.
And I only mentioned that to highlight that equity and diversity are central to what I'm about.
As State Board Vice President Dr. Glover-Wood said in her confirmation hearing last year, which I watched, quote, our mathematics standards are very clear on what children need to be able to know and be able to do as they matriculate through various grades, end quote.
And standards are important for equity, because without them will be the kids without good counseling.
For example, the kids whose parents don't have college degrees who get derailed into course pathways that don't provide adequate preparation.
And I want to mention, Dr. Brown mentioned half an hour ago, IDS, for example, Cal State system passed the resolution just in March saying that, for example, IDS doesn't satisfy, doesn't align with standards or prepare kids for college.
So these standards are very important.
In version three, even after today's addendum, the framework retains advocacy for flawed data science courses.
For example, its mentions of UC and as in chapter eight, as national media are now reporting, this was based on flawed course approvals by the UC for its admissions requirements.
This was based on flawed course approvals by the UC for its admissions requirements, for which it was reported that UC just reversed course revoking approvals only days ago.
This morning's addendum is an improvement by chapter five on data science.
Your time is up.
It must be removed.
Okay.
Thank you.
Sorry.
Gabriella Mitchell, The Knowledge Shop.
Racism is an indelible to the black body and the spirit, and the physical and spiritual murdering of black bodies is unfortunately part and parcel of America's history.
As a result, black children are steered into detention centers, jails, and prisons from the hallways of school buildings.
James Baldwin explained, if one managed to change the curriculum in all the schools, so Negroes learn more about themselves and their contributions to this culture, you would be liberating not only Negroes, you'd be liberating white people who know nothing about their own history.
If they're compelled to lie about one aspect of anybody's history, you must lie about it all.
If you have to pretend that I hold all the cotton just because I loved you, you have done something to yourself.
Africa is home to the world's earliest known use of measuring and calculation, confirming the continent as the birthplace to basic mathematics and advanced mathematics.
In 1958, after the Soviet Union successfully launched Sputnik, U.S. authorities pushed-
Your time is up.
Oh, sorry.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And I just wanted to add that I'm really appreciative that the framework is highlighting the fact that we should highlight STEM areas that are difficult and challenging for students.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, everyone.
Today I wanted to share with you why I love math so much.
Here are a few reasons why I have a passion for math.
Firstly, math is not just a subject we learn in school.
It's a tool that helps us understand the world around us.
It challenges my brain and makes me think creatively.
Secondly, math is everywhere in our daily lives, whether we realize it or not.
We use math in many activities when we count our pocket money or calculate how much time it takes to get to school.
We are using math.
It helps us manage our money, understand the measurements, and even make predictions.
Math is like a secret code that unlocks the mysteries of the world.
Thirdly, math teaches us valuable life skills.
When we learn math, we also learn to think logically and critically.
Whether we are faced with a difficult decision or trying to find a solution to a problem, math helps us think in a structured and organized way.
Lastly, math is a subject that keeps on evolving and expanding.
In conclusion, I love math because it challenges me, teaches me important skills, and offers me endless opportunities for growth.
Thank you for listening.
Good evening. My name is Edamais Ficre.
Today I'm here to talk about something that is often dreaded by people all over the world.
Mathematics. Yes, you heard it right.
Mathematics and why I love it so much.
To begin with, let me tell you that I was not always a math enthusiast.
In fact, my relationship with math was quite opposite growing up.
I remember sitting in math class avoiding eye contact with my teacher, praying for her not to call me to solve a problem on the board.
But as I grew older and my understanding of math deepened, I came to almost love the subject.
Now, why do I love math so much, you ask?
Firstly, math is the foundation of all scientific and technological advancements.
Every breakthrough in science and technology has relied on some form of mathematical understanding.
From the simplest circuit in your phone to the most complex space mission, math is an integral part of it all.
Without math, it would be impossible to make sense of the world around us.
What I admire most about math is its beauty and its complexity.
Mathematical concepts can be abstract and sometimes difficult.
Thank you.
So our next speaker should be Will Parrish.
Will will be followed by Steve McDougal, Michael Malioni, Manuel Buenrustro, Efren Mercado, and our final speaker, Brian Rivas.
If Will Parrish is not here, then we'd like to hear from Steve McDougal.
Members of the board, city staff, and the public at large, I'm Steve McDougal with the California Federation of Teachers.
Nice work on the frameworks.
Thank you for your efforts.
But it doesn't matter how you roll this out and what you do with the frameworks unless you have the number one resource ready to go in front of students.
And that's the teacher.
We've got a lot of work to do to find teachers who not only know their stuff, but are relatable to the audience, the students.
Although in recent times we have funding that we're going to go out and find these teachers, we don't have them now.
We didn't have solid math teachers in 2019 B.C. before COVID.
We were short then and we're even more short now.
We got to find them. We got to train them up.
We got to scale them up and we got to get them out there.
Teachers of color, teachers from underserved communities, working in those communities with those students so that they're relatable.
Let's get that work done before no matter what we do, no textbook, no framework or special desks are going to work.
We got to get the folks in front of the students ready to go.
Thank you.
No applause?
All right.
Let's see.
Hello, everybody.
Hello, Madam President and members of the board.
My name is Michael Malione.
I'm a STEM tutor and the founder of Save Math.
I've been following the framework since the first field review.
And my issue with it remains the same.
The framework shortchanges our STEM-inclined students.
The structuring around drivers of investigation is the most important.
The structuring around drivers of investigation is an indirect and blinkered view of math, which obscures many of the more common fundamentals that we rely upon across all fields.
There's no conclusive research to support it.
And also organizing around big ideas, as expressed in the CMF, fails to ensure that students are learning and connecting the necessary details.
It's teaching experimental science and social science instead of math and dismissing content that's not obviously related to those particular areas.
This will put students at a disadvantage with regard to college or career STEM readiness.
And more broadly, adoption of this framework will only worsen the existing proficiency crisis.
If adoption changes the meaning of proficiency, that's not viable over the long term.
It's a scandal in the making, so I urge you to reject this framework.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening, members of the board and staff.
Manuel Bonrostro, Director of Policy at Californians Together.
And we are proud to have been working in close collaboration with Education Trust West and many other advocacy organizations and education organizations over the past two years to advocate on behalf of the framework to be
assets-based, culturally responsive, and to have strong guidance to ensure access to our highest needs students, including English learners.
We believe that this framework is strong in all of these areas, and we applaud you for that.
However, we are requesting an addition to Chapter 13 that would clarify the expectations for instructional materials to be aligned to both math and ELD standards.
We submitted a letter on July 6th, which was signed by six organizations that make this recommendation.
Given its strengths, we support approval of the 2023 math framework with the requested edits added to Chapter 13.
Thank you.
Madam President, members of the board, I'm Brian Rivas speaking on behalf of the Education Trust West.
We support the framework.
We're asking you to adopt it.
We want to thank you and your staff for all of the work and the hours that went into it.
In a nutshell, math has been a stumbling block for a lot of students of color in achieving college and career readiness, and research shows it doesn't have to be that way.
There are ways that we can reshape the way we think about math so that all students are given an opportunity.
You just have to do, I think, a few basic things.
One is teachers have to believe that math is for everybody.
Students have to see themselves in the content, and that has to be done in a way that is culturally relevant.
And we have to think deliberately about including students like English learners in the math curriculum because historically they've been sort of set aside to English language development only.
So we support this.
We think it's going to take an important step forward to rethinking math and make an opportunity available to all.
Thank you, sir.
Good afternoon. I'm Efra Mercado from the California Teacher Association.
We support the math framework and its adoption, and we look forward to working with the state board and the ITC and everyone regarding the rollout as it moves forward.
We believe that the equity and justice components of the framework are really powerful, and it will help our teachers to now enhance math in our state, and we look forward to that.
A couple of things that we want to call out as well, the statewide rollout.
We look forward to partnering with the CDE and state board on that and also focusing in on teacher-led professional development and also working with the CTC to integrate the new framework into the TPEs for the teacher prep programs.
Thank you.
Thank you.

Hi, this is Susan Callowick. I'm a parent in Palo Alto Unified, and I also work in atmospheric science and do volunteer tutoring, and thank you for your efforts on this framework.
The new version is much better, but I would also urge you not to accept the framework until Appendix A shows pathway to calculus by 12th grade or earlier, which, as we've heard from previous speakers, is needed for STEM majors in college.
And if Appendix A is not currently accurate, please update it to show a pathway to calculus by 12th grade. Thank you.

My name is Brian Conrad. I'm a math professor and the director of undergraduate studies for math at Stanford. As the son of an award-winning high school math teacher, I've overseen many efforts to broaden access to fundamental math and have won multiple teaching awards.
The recent revision of the CMS has failed in its responsibilities to the board and the citizens of California.
The CMS still does discourage 8th grade Algebra 1 in chapters 8 and 9, and despite the 10-year failed experiment in San Francisco contradicting the work of Bob Moses and Adrian Mims,
its coverage of the standards is incomplete and nearly impossible for parents to navigate, and its guidance to teachers and publishers lacks practical details.
Misrepresentation of citations remains. This morning's edits barely scratched the surface.
It remains confused and misleading on data science, contrary to the skills needed by employers and four-year college degrees in quantitative fields such as data science and economics.
Nobody with real expertise in data science has been involved, so chapter 5 has to be removed.
Math is powerful and useful, but the CMS remains shackled by ideology, misinformation, and disorganization.
I urge the board to delay the vote so the core problems can be fixed.

Hi, my name is Ron Buckmeyer. I'm a professor of mathematics at Occidental College and a 2023 fellow of society for industrial and applied mathematics.
I urge the board to approve the framework.

And I believe that the framework communicates this idea and will, in the inclusion of data science at the high school level, will improve mathematics learning for all our students.

My name is Katrina Godo. I am an alumnus of California Public Schools and a 2022 graduate of the University of California Berkeley.
I'm calling in support of the inclusion of high school data science courses in chapter eight of the mathematics framework.
During my senior year, I authored a thesis that relied heavily on quantitative data analysis.
That thesis earned me highest honors in political science and one of three finalist nominations for the political science departmental citation.
To get there, I had to conquer a quantitative methods requirement that my California public school education left me drastically underprepared for and my anxiety about my own quantitative literacy almost led me to self-select out of the honors program entirely.
Our California public school system should not leave our students playing catch up at our state's own elite universities.
For that reason, I emphatically urge the board to adopt the framework. Thank you.

Members of the State Board of Education. My name is Marcos Montes and I'm calling on behalf of the Southern California College of Payment Network.
Our network collectively serves more than 200,000 students and families in our region and is composed of 180 college access organizations.
We understand that math courses can be college gatekeepers for thousands of underrepresented students.
Our team partnered with Justice Equations to conduct a survey about the perception students have of high school math courses in college.
Many students perceive calculus as the golden ticket to college.
Our survey found that calculus is not widely available for students and even if it is, many students do not take it or advise not to take it.
A way to combat this in an era of decreased college enrollment is to have more options available for students.
Our state needs to ensure that data science courses are available to students, especially in the 11th and 12th grade.
Early evidence of data science courses suggest that they contribute positively to student outcomes.
They offer alternatives to traditional math pathways and they increase four-year college agility.
Please ensure that data science courses are available to students. Thank you.
Thank you.

Good afternoon. I'm Daryl Young, professor of math at Harvey Mudd College and a former high school math teacher in LAUSD, and I'd like to speak in favor of the new math framework.
One polarizing issue has been the framework's guidance that schools should develop a range of advanced math courses, including but not limited to data science, as flexible pathways to college and careers.
At least five major US professional math organizations agree with the sentiment because we have an unhealthy preoccupation with calculus.
Too many students majoring in STEM fields end up repeating calculus in college.
A pathway to calculus should be available to students, but other pathways should be available and valorized.
I have great concerns about equitable access to these math pathways and that these pathways not become de facto tracks for marginalized students.
But I hope that we can attend to issues of equity as we innovate beyond the conventional calculus track.
I appreciate that the framework is pushing us in that direction. Thank you.

My name is Eric Groza. I'm the director of data science for everyone, a national initiative and part of the coalition, now representing nearly 3,000 education leaders across the country.
In 2020, our coalition recommended the incoming administration help support K-12 data science courses and programs become universally offered everywhere,
reflecting both current and future data driven technologies like AI affecting all careers, academic disciplines and livelihoods for every high school graduate.
This call included President Emeritus Richard Atkinson of the University of California system, Jennifer Shays, the associate provost of UC Berkeley Computer Data Science Society,
countless data science staff, mathematics faculty from around the country, including several other UC and CSU faculty members, the entire leadership of the American Statistical Association and multiple math associations.
We just awarded a chapter five and chapter eight guidelines for data science course opportunities consistent with 16 other US states that have launched statewide data science programs.
As a category, we believe data science education programs will contribute to a strong STEM experience in high school and college and for the 21st century broadly. Thank you.

Good afternoon. My name is Dr. Melissa Gilbert. I have been a teacher, professional development provider and teacher educator in California for over two decades.
When I was in college in early 1990s, I was astounded that number of my classmates whose K-12 experience with mathematics had been so negative that they hoped to never take another math class.
As someone who loved my math and science courses, I was dismayed.
This led me to a career pathway focused on studying student motivation and how classroom environments could support diverse students' engagement with and achievement in math courses.
I enthusiastically endorsed the 2023 draft mathematics framework that provides guidance regarding research-based instructional practices and detailed vignettes to support teachers' implementation of these practices with all students,
not only those who have been well served by past instructional practices, but also the many who have not.
Even more than when I was in college today, we need to implement this framework that will support many more students to graduate from high school with both the mathematical competence and the motivation to engage with mathematical concepts in deep and flexible ways for many 21st century jobs and careers.
Thank you. In addition to adopting the framework, thank you very much.

Greetings. My name is Pajul Seshayar. I'm a full professor of mathematical sciences at George Mason University and also the chair of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences Committee on Mathematics Instruction.
As a computational mathematician and data scientist myself, I'm happy to hear about the emphasis the California math framework places on the importance of data science, and I'm here to support it.
Inclusion of data science at the high school level is extremely important for career readiness for the next generation.
We are in the day and age of going beyond the educational philosophy of here is the mathematics, go solve the problem. To here is the problem, let's find the mathematics to do it.
Let's find the data to do it. And so it's very important to have such a high school data science course, which is important for all students.
And I actually was the high school of I was the higher education member that participated in the development of the first ever high school data science standards and curriculum for the Commonwealth of Virginia.
And this has now been implemented over 20 schools, and we are now going for the second round of this program, which is already bringing exactly. Thank you.

David Margulies this framework guides for a common ninth and 10th grade experience in their math pathway diagram with algebra one and ninth grade with a common experience.
This means for all students one size fits all. This has been an utter failure in San Francisco. You have San Francisco elected officials writing you telling you this.
You have an open letter you ignored from the STEM community clearly explaining the failure of this and how it especially harms socioeconomically disadvantaged students.
Enabling STEM careers of SED students is obviously not a goal of this framework. However, education codes protect students from you.
These codes both expect the math placement of one student to differ from another and make it illegal for you to force students to repeat courses.
They are already proficient in making your recommendation of a common experience illegal.
This framework guides districts towards knowingly harmful and illegal policies and should be rejected.

Hi Joy Straub. I just retired in June after 35 years as a California math teacher.
For the last six years I had the amazing opportunity to teach a full high school data science course.
This course transformed my own teaching practices in these later years and transformed the lives of many students.
Data science by nature brings equity into the classroom. Special Ed, English learners and calculus students work side by side.
Each is an expert in their domain area and engaged to work. Students who had a dislike for math suddenly were transformed into math lovers.
They became skilled in statistical analysis, computer programming and critical thinking, valuable skills needed to navigate this world.
Students found themselves capable of communicating their mathematical findings and interpretations,
a natural outcome based on the high engagement to research current issues and to share their capstone research findings with authentic audiences.
Since I also taught AP statistics, I saw many students who never would have taken an AP math course take AP statistics.
The DS course completely prepared them for this. I witnessed their success with many now wishing to major in statistics or data science.
So my support, I totally support the incorporation of data science as described in chapters five and eight with expectations of high rigor at the high school level.
Thank you. Next caller with the last four digits 5959. You are now live. Please start your public comment.
The board president and members. My name is Dr. Philipe Obwehi. I'm a math coordinator at Los Angeles School District.
I'm here to speak as a math educator, member of the public and the parent.
It is commendable to see that math foundation of data science is included in math framework graphs.
Thanks to the committee. In LAUSD, we have been implementing data science as a high school math course.
In introduction to data science ideas, which Dr. Kendall mentioned earlier,
students develop logical and critical thinking skills and connect data to other mathematical concepts.
Students understand statistics through data visualization, data acquisition, and use data to make informed decisions.
Students learn how to program in our studio, which is a programming language.
This skill is needed in IT fields, and students are equipped early enough to pursue careers in data science and computer information technology.
They learn distributions, probability, simulation, data collection methods, predictions, and models.
And in some instances, students use participatory sensing systems, a student collects and analyzes data using mobile phones and web technology. Thank you.

Yes, my name is Kathy Jordan. Thank you.
It's laudable that the SBE and authors of the framework seek to find ways to help struggling math students.
Certainly all want to see California's math students attain greater proficiency.
But the proposals put forth in the math framework are not the way to do it.
They will not accomplish it. And as in San Francisco Unified, it will make things worse.
In contrast to what President Darling-Hammond said in Chapter 10, lines 808 through 810, the framework recommends a common middle school experience,
which means to discourage Algebra 1 acceleration in grade 8 or earlier.
Thus, the California math framework's proposals mirror what was implemented at San Francisco Unified,
which failed with decreased student math proficiency and increased inequity.
These proposals disadvantage those who rely solely on the public school.
In the zeal to help struggling children, it seems that the authors of the math framework have placed ideology ahead of results.
Thank you. Your time is up. Please reject the proposed framework.

Hello, my name is Kelly Statham, and I want to speak in favor of adoption of the 2023 California mathematics framework, specifically the inclusions of chapters five and eight.
As a content specialist at the Fresno County Superintendent of Schools, I work with schools throughout our county to build powerful mathematics programs.
Some of my work with high schools is developing secondary math pathways that offer all students increased access and opportunities to study a variety of advanced math topics.
The math pathways are designed based on students' interests and support their future career aspirations.
One course that high schools are excited to offer is data science.
Data science brings a greater sense of the relevancy of mathematics to students' lives by giving them tools and skills to better understand their world.
Through the inclusion of learning on data science and the development of math pathways, we are creating college and career ready graduates that are better prepared for the challenges and opportunities that California children will face in the future.

This framework responds to the structural barriers to math success, and we educators continually strive to collectively work to transform teaching and learning by empowering our students and their families.
This framework stands that all students can access and achieve success in mathematics as envisioned in the standards is a testament to our commitment for every student to experience the school mathematics in a joyful, relevant, and enriching way.
As Naomi Porter said earlier, she's been blessed to work alongside you who prioritize on a student's well-being, success, and inclusivity.

Hello, I'm Pamela Birdman, executive director of Just Equations, a policy institute focused on ensuring that math education advances educational equity.
Seven years ago, the CDE launched an effort supporting development of innovative senior year math courses.
These included offerings in data science, statistics, and discrete math, as well as more traditional content leading to calculus, all in collaboration with UC and CSU faculty.
These new options, especially data science, are now expanding the range of courses and instructional strategies available to students.
Preparing those interested in STEM as well as non-STEM futures and opening up new worlds to students who otherwise might disengage from mathematical pursuits.
It's important that Chapter 5 and 8 of the California Maths Framework support and reinforce the inclusion of multiple options in the 11th and 12th grades. Thank you so much.

Good afternoon. This is Sally Fox on behalf of CABE.
We support this new mathematics framework because it's the result of years of challenging work within a careful process of public review, input, and revision.
It will have a positive impact on the math achievement of all California students and especially multilingual learners acquiring English and other languages at school.
We believe the recognition of families' cultural, linguistic, and mathematical knowledge as assets upon which to build skill and understanding will also lead to greater parent engagement.
However, we would ask you to make the small but important change previously mentioned in Chapter 13, Criterion 1, in the instructional materials adoption.
By explicitly embedding ELD standards, teachers will be more likely to meet English learners' needs.
Scaffolded literacy instruction across the curriculum will then be integrated into math lessons with opportunities for designated ELD lessons connected to content. Thank you very much.

I'm Charles Steinhorn for Identification Director of the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences and an emeritus research professor of mathematics and statistics at Vassar College, but I'm speaking on behalf of myself today.
The mathematical sciences have always evolved over time based on new knowledge and deep new applications, and the instructional canon, of course, evolves with it.
The emerging field of data science will play a critical role in preparing students at all levels to thrive in our digital world.
Data science thus has an important place in the mathematical experience of students in our schools and aligns with future workforce needs.
I want to point to the new data science course for high school students that's been developed and piloted with great success in Virginia.
Such a course, appropriately to my mind, has three years of high school mathematics as a prerequisite and thus ensures that students are well prepared before taking the course for any of the pathways they might pursue.
The California framework indeed should have a place for such an advanced course. Thank you.

Hello, I'm Michael Evans. I'm a former math major. I did a data science program and worked as a public health researcher.
The framework, as currently written, is confused about the details of data science and grouping.
The data science doesn't require advanced statistics and calculus, which are necessary for success in advanced education.
Making this track as an alternative to those advanced classes may make it a de facto track for marginalized students who will get left behind compared to students who do take them.
Every student should be educated to their greatest potential, which means they should have the option to take algebra in eighth grade and calculus in high school.
I also left a written comment with citations with more detail. Thank you.

Andrew Fox, math education professional. The development of this framework has been an exercise in how misaligned incentives create systemic policies which negatively impact underserved communities.
Just one example among many. The framework advocates for the creation of a cross-disciplinary course that has been mislabeled data science.
We've just heard here that the UC committee has determined that this data science course does not satisfy UC math requirements.
Data science is effectively a lower track of education. What does that tell you?
It tells you that the framework was designed to create a system of tracking by another name.
Today, we also heard the data science. Her data science celebrate as a high level math class, which attracted students that are more diverse than typical math students.
What does that tell you? It tells you that this framework enshrines systems that actually track diverse students to a lower pathway, thus limiting their potential.
Think about this for a minute. The framework has a built-in multi-track pathway that routes underserved communities to lower track.
What we are seeing today is a de facto codification of systemic racism into policy.

My name is Zou. I'm a mother of two kids. Ten years ago, the California public mess already disappointed me.
And ten years later, it's even wasted time of the kids who have learned real math in their middle school and high school.
The new framework will put my kids below the international standard, put a lot of the California kids.
The California kids cannot compete in the future. So this is a strong waste of dollars of four years of public taxpayers money and put our kids backward as strongly against this new framework.

Hi. My name is Marty Hoyt. I've been a high school math teacher for over 17 years and I've taught every level of math from pre-algebra to AP calculus.
I've had the pleasure of teaching data science and it's been transformative not only for myself but for my students.
They've been engaged and excited about important STEM content in ways that I've experienced that they haven't experienced in math classrooms prior.
As opposed to algorithms taught disjointedly and in unconnected ways, students learn how data and mathematics can directly affect the world around them and they become agents of change in their own communities.
The overarching ideas of statistical analysis, technical writing, and critical reasoning were presented to students with tangible real world data.
As you can imagine, this was incredibly challenging to students, yet they persevered.
Throughout today's meeting from 830 until now, you've looked at and discussed raw data, data visualizations in ways that inform and promote policy change.
And yet very little of the skills you've shown all day are ingrained within the current math framework.
It's 2023 and graduating students might be able to perform synthetic division but are completely illiterate when it comes to data and that's inexcusable.
I enthusiastically support the new framework and I'm excited to see California lead the way to ensure all students have access to higher mathematics, that they will prepare them hopefully one day to become a member of this board.
Thank you.

Hi, this is Minju. I'm a parent of high school students.
While it is great to have students who have trouble learning math, however, the anti-marriage statewide framework is to lower standards in the name of equity outcome.
It would have disastrous ramifications on the quality of public education.
America needs competent engineers, students, scientists, mathematics, and other STEM talents.
More than ever, we simply cannot allow public education to keep spinning downwards.
At the end of the day, when you need to get surgery in hospital, you wouldn't want equity-hired or diversity-hired doctors to do surgery for you.
You want to have the most competent doctors.
Think about your own future and your own kids' future.
The equity-themed math framework is playing with fire by conducting the ideological experiment on our next generation.
I urge you to reject this framework. Bring back real math, not equity math.
Thank you.

Math teaching time is limited. It shouldn't be focused on free inquiry, data science, social issues, and slowing down kids who are ready to advance.
Students need to master the basics, understand them, and then move to more advanced concepts.
You should not require summer programs to be able to accelerate.
This dumbing down affects minority students the most who have the ability to excel but get sidetracked into classes that are not recognized by colleges and reduce opportunities and do not adequately prepare them for STEM careers.
I urge you to reject this framework unless the presumed path is changed to calculus and beyond to give our children opportunities in the modern world to not only be accepted to college but to succeed in college and after.
Math needs to be differentiated. Students learn it differently. One size fits all. Doesn't work. Half the kids are bored. The other half are discouraged.
The caller who said this codifies systemic racism had it right.
This dumbing down of math doesn't help anybody. We're importing engineers into our state from other countries. Let's instead educate our kids instead of doing that and teach them proper math.
No framework that discourages them. Thank you.

Good afternoon, President Darling-Hammond and other board members.
Liz Guiana, Public Advocates for the LCFF Equity Coalition.
We thank the board, the department, and the Instructional Quality Commission for this process, for listening to the substantial public comments and input in developing the math framework.
We're very pleased to see that the focus on equity in pedagogical approaches to teaching math remains from the previous version, and we support the recommendation that you approve it.
However, we request that language in Chapter 13 around Category 1 for instructional materials alignment with standards be modified to ensure that instructional materials are aligned to the math standards and the English language development standards.
In the same way that ELD alignment is expected in the English language arts framework. Thank you for your hard work.

Hi, this is Evan Shea. I'm currently a data scientist and a data science manager, and I've worked at two of the big five tech companies.
As an educator, I've also taught the largest introductory machine learning and data science course at Stanford, which reaches a thousand students every year in addition to five million online.
I'm in support of this framework. For too long, we worked with data scientists who come from specific segments of society.
Of the thousands of data scientists I've worked with, I can count the number of black scientists on one hand. This is an injustice.
Of the hundreds of data scientists I've interviewed, nearly all of them can regurgitate theorems and they can tell you about the calculus and theory behind these data science algorithms.
But very few are actually prepared to implement these algorithms in the real world. When asked simple questions about bias and how to quantitatively assess bias using statistics, they're not able to answer.
And this is a weakness that the current framework does address. So for these reasons, for both equity and rigor, I'm in support of this framework.

I've served as a math student for the past six years. I'm speaking today about the inclusion of high school data science courses, specifically from chapter eight of the math framework.
So data science, I think, is not that important. What is important is preserving students' engagement and long-term beliefs around math.
I've seen from students a slow formation of negative lifelong attitudes built at the root of math classrooms in high school.
Why do I need to learn data science rules of science? I've been asked. Data science courses offer one avenue to change this.
I recommend the board to take seriously the inclusion of data science courses in high school mathematics curricula and to encourage schools and teachers to also place intellectual importance on these courses.
We need to allow more students a chance to show intelligence and high achievement in math. And I believe data science courses can do this. Thank you.

Good afternoon. My name is Winyon Wu calling on behalf of the Californians for Equal Rights Foundation.
Only 33 percent of students in California's public schools are proficient in math. 2023 sees further declines in test scores.
This deeply flawed framework will only exacerbate the problem of low performance by dumbing down academic standards and obsessing over ideological constructions.
Citing on published papers and misrepresenting evidence, the revised framework lacks rigor.
In the name of equity, it discourages students' enrollment of eighth grade, Algebra 1, and substitute Algebra 2 with data science classes.
Focused on teaching for equity and engagement, this entire merit framework is also steeped in the far left ideology.
Thousands of STEM professionals and academics oppose the framework and the UC board which has support for the data science recommendation.
Please reconsider adopting the 2023 math framework and do what you can to support learning and excellence for all California students.

Hi, my name is Vikas Reddy. I'm the vice president of research of the Campaign for College Opportunity, a California nonprofit dedicated to increasing access and to support in higher education for minority students across the state.
Introduction to data science courses offer an important access point for minority and low income students in California.
Research notes that students enrolled in these courses were more likely to come from low income backgrounds than their cohort peers and more likely to identify as Latinx than their cohort peers.
Researchers also note that enrollment in this set of courses increases the likelihood of completing the state's A through G requirements and of enrolling in college subsequent to high school graduation.
Furthermore, teachers note that these courses help contextualize math content and they provide students with a valuable entry point into the curriculum.
I urge the board to ensure that these important courses remain a part of chapter eight of the California math framework. Thank you.

Good afternoon, President Darling-Hammond and members of the board. My name is Ashley Lugo calling on behalf of the California County Superintendents.
We strongly support the adoption of the twenty twenty three mathematics framework.
The California County Superintendents applaud the work of the instructional quality commission, CDE and state board staff and the region fifteen comprehensive center for the inclusive approach that was taken carefully.
I was taken to carefully review and analyze feedback from the second field review and inform the current draft.
We look forward to partnering with the CDE and SBE in the rollout of framework to ensure that all students have equitable access to high quality standards based math instruction.

Good afternoon. My name is Aracely Simeon with the Parent Organization Network.
First, we would like to thank CDE and the State Board of Education for the thorough and inclusive community engagement process.
We appreciate that you're modeling best practices for the field.
Also, I want to thank the twenty five family serving organizations that contributed and supported the advocacy letters and report upon drafted about family math.
Second, we want to express our support for the final version of the math framework.
And last, we do want to note that although the language improved, the family math connection is not fully aligned with the new CCT credentialing requirements for teachers teaching pre K through third grade that were adopted last October.
We would also urge you to consider building upon the strategies from the California early math family math initiative.
But to ensure full alignment across credentialing requirements, frameworks and professional development, we urge you to take a last look to make appropriate edits related to family engagement.

Hello. Hi, this is Rory Abernethy. I am a third generation black STEM graduate from UC Berkeley and my grandfather was the first black chemist hired by the Department of Food and Agriculture in California.
I'm a 21 year math educator. I have taught grades six through 12 math and I want to thank you for listening to us.
I'm in full support of the math framework and its adoption and I'm happy you didn't just listen to educators but with black members, black community members with deep roots in K-12 education.
Nationally, 30% of mathematicians are women and 70% are men. Does that mean men are smarter?
66% of mathematicians are white, 11% Asian, 10% Hispanic and 7% black. Does that mean that white people are smarter?
This framework allows a way forward. Currently, we are missing out. Students are missing out and we are missing out as a nation without access to diverse mathematical thinkers in terms of security and otherwise.
Thank you. Thank you.

Good afternoon. I am Veronica Torres-McLean, a bilingual educator, math coach and instructional leader for over 25 years.
I am an assistant director at the Center for Equity for English Learners at Loyola Marymount University, focusing on research, policy and practice to serve the academic, social and language needs of linguistically and culturally diverse students.
We have appreciated the opportunity to comment on the framework revision process and thank all of those involved for creating a framework that offers a vision for math instruction focused on equitable learning to ensure access to rigorous coursework for all students,
including English learners. Alongside a coalition of advocating organizations, we express our support for the adoption of the math framework.
We want to amplify two recommendations. First, in Chapter 13, please include alignment to math and EOD standards for adoption criteria number one.
And second, support the system-wide implementation of the framework at all levels and provide districts and schools guidance and quality professional development that considers the local context,
including the cultural and linguistic makeup of students and families. Thank you.

Good afternoon, Dr. Darling-Hammond and board members. Diana Wu on behalf of the Association of Calvary School Administrators.
I actually appreciate the work of the board and city staff for reviewing and addressing their concerns raised about the 2023 mathematics framework.
In order to successfully implement the mathematics framework, it is crucial that statewide support and resources are provided to teachers and school site leaders at the district level.
This will allow educators to effectively differentiate instruction. These districts may vary in their capacity to provide these resources and ultimately ensure that every student is given the opportunity to thrive.
Additionally, I actually appreciate the mathematics framework's retention of local discretion and control, allowing districts to meet the students' unique needs.
As such, it is important to retain standards-aligned textbook options that support the new framework and current frameworks LEAs may choose to retain. Thank you.
Thank you. Next caller with the last four digits, 0530. You are now live. Please start your public comment.
Hello, my name is Lee Spivey and I am a math teacher in Merced County, California.
And I've taught explorations in data science for the last two years for your courses going into my third.
The course has been rich with both rigor and real world context.
I've watched students wrestle with creating and manipulating formulas to solve open ended problems,
but doing so through equity-connected topics such as skin tone representation and media, community water usage, and other topics that are genuine and engaging.
They've developed their critical thinking skills, analytical skills.
They endeavor to make sense of their calculations and results from large databases like the CDC 500 cities list, sample sets from the American Community Survey.
And it's just been a pleasure to hear or have an absence of hearing.
How am I going to use this or when? Why do I need to learn this from these students?
Earlier, an analogy was made to banking about how we do not go into a financial institution.
We can do stuff from the seat in the audience and our students world is changing just like that exponentially.

Good afternoon, board. This is Jessica Sacco, statewide director of the California STEM Network, a project of Children Now.
Through policy advocacy, communications and outreach, we strive to ensure that all students,
but especially those who have been historically been underserved and underrepresented in STEM education have access to the highest quality STEM education possible.
High quality, equitable math instruction is critical to providing students with the foundational knowledge and skills they need to succeed in a future STEM related careers.
I applaud the edits incorporated into this final draft of the 2023 math framework and thank the CDE staff and writers for maintaining the commitment to equitable math for all California's diverse learners,
multiple and flexible pathways, the importance of a growth mindset, universal design for learning and the inclusion of pathways for students wishing to pursue STEM beyond high school.
Finally, I would like to request the minor edit, chapter 13, line 257 to incorporate the ELB standards into category one for the instructional materials. Thank you.

Hello, my name is Amy Lynn Cabrera and I am one AP staff and I'm now going on my fifth year of teaching IDF in San Diego.
I speak in support of the framework and highly endorse the inclusion of chapter five and chapter eight.
In these past four years of my teaching career, I've witnessed an unprivileged amount of evidence of students truly learning and thinking.
And I know that is undoubtedly because I've been fortunate to teach data science.
Data science inherently opens student access to mathematical practices through deeply culturally responsive, engaging and rigorous content, content that students realize that they have a voice and their voice matters.
I've witnessed students grapple through investigations of their own food habits, time, use, stress, mental health, just to name a few.
And students leave this course with renewed or greater senses of their mathematical capability and confidence.
Open mindedness towards potential higher education and careers, data fluency and the delightful simple awareness that curiosity, thinking and learning is beautiful and fun.
With that being said, the adoption of the framework means a great deal for all of us who care about these moments and learning with our students and solidifying everything we already know about what education should be. Thank you.
Thank you.

Hi, Patty Chavez with SEAL.
Thank you and yay for math and for including equitable responsive practices for all students, including EL.
SEAL recently released a brief describing how our approach is helping educators equitably implement California EL policies and how our model offers promising practices for equitable implementation of this new proposed framework.
Historically, few ELs have been able to pursue STEM careers because they've been excluded and deprived of a full rigorous curriculum and STEM instruction.
It's begun to change due to the implementation of the ELA ELD framework to support ELs.
The new framework now provides an opportunity to extend this trajectory.
We support the new math framework and references to ELA ELD and we ask you to consider adding languages to Chapter 13 that would make alignment to the ELD standards a key feature for instructional materials.
Thank you for helping us transform the lives of ELs and in turn transform the STEM landscape that desperately needs a multilingual diverse workforce.
Thank you.
Thank you.

My name is Jason Lee Morgan, a 17-year core math and data science teacher from Dominguez High School in the Title I district of Compton Unified.
As a young black male growing up in South Central LA, I was bused an hour outside of my community to receive a quality education.
Living firsthand inequities of our system where I learned that communities that did not look like me received a vastly different learning experience than my own.
My travels and observations as an educator and now as a parent touring schools I bear witness that certain communities have more freedom to impart a rich mathematical experience where students learn to think like mathematicians.
But these spaces won't for greater diversity.
The harsh reality is that far too often access to rich mathematical thinking and reasoning in the day-to-day class are determined by income and location.
Myself and my Compton student reformers have been privileged to pilot and implement several elements of the proposed framework with remarkable success over the years.
Our students find it shifts their relationship with math to that of mathematician rather than math test taker.
It is rigorous, it has broadened their view of mathematics, increased enrollment in math courses including calculus, enhanced empowerment and representation in STEM, and students demand early exposure for communities of color.
The proposed math framework is the next step in iterating toward a brighter mathematics future for all communities. Thank you.
Thank you.

Yes, hi.
My name is Denise Trevizo.
Can you hear me?
Yes.
Okay, thank you.
The issue with the proposed framework go much, much deeper than grammatical errors.
While the framework has been worked on extensively for perhaps thousands of hours, we the public only have less than 11 days to read, research and form opinions on over 900 plus pages of text.
In order for us to all have a seat at the table, as the previous speaker suggested, we need to have more time to review the framework.
This has been in the works for four plus years, but most of us, the public, have only had a very small fraction of that time to review what's been presented.
Please do not rush us through and let's ensure that we have all the time we need to review the framework and to let us all have a voice.
Thank you.

Good afternoon.
My name is Amy Vasoli, and I'll be speaking specifically to Chapter 5 and Chapter 8 for high school data science education.
I've taught in California for 25 years.
In the last four years, I've had the pleasure of teaching intro to data science at our comprehensive high school.
Data science has been valuable for my students because there are several opportunities for my students to develop critical thinking and communication skills.
Every day in class, we're discussing and analyzing large data sets that are current and relevant.
And we're using the data cycle paired with learning how to code to answer our statistical investigative questions.
Sometimes we even collect data about our own class and analyze that.
One thing that I've noticed in my data science class that is different than my traditional math classes is that more students are becoming curious about the data.
And I hear things like, I wonder, or what if I tried this?
And the students are excited about exploring the data in a creative way that is all their own.
In addition, the students are seeing connections in their other classes, such as history, science, psychology.
And overall, the data science has transformed my classroom and my students and the conversations that happen in that space.
As Cindy Kazanis requested earlier.
Thank you.
Thank you.

Hi, I'm Wayne. I'm a parent. I live in San Francisco.
My local school district is one of the experiments that led to the CMS.
The district spends about twenty four thousand dollars per student per year.
Only about half of the students meet state standards in math.
And the black and brown students percentage is much lower.
I echo everything that Brian Conrad said earlier. Everything is published on his website.
Please delay the vote until all issues documented by Brian Conrad have been addressed to do anything else to be irresponsible and reckless.

Hello, my name is Spencer Sherman and I am the vice president of strategic partnerships at the Link Learning Alliance.
The Link Learning Alliance leads an education movement proven to help more students stay in school, graduate on time, and develop the knowledge and skills employers seek for the future.
We support the inclusion of data science course options in high school.
We support it because we believe all students deserve the option to take advanced math courses that are academically rigorous and highly relevant to careers in California's high wage and high growth industries.
Through link learning, we've seen time and again how real world applied learning experiences make a profound difference for students and communities.
The mathematics frameworks can be transformative for students, for equity, and for the economic future of California.
If we connect it to what our young people are learning now with the opportunities ahead, that means including data science course options in the math framework.
Thank you.

Yes, my name is Stephanie Holloway.
I'm an educator and was a member of the CFCC.
I want to wholeheartedly express my support for the post-math framework.
Throughout the arduous revision process, I witnessed firsthand the tireless commitment and collective expertise that went into crafting a document that is comprehensive and student centered.
The revisions reflect a deep understanding of the evolving educational landscape and needs of California's diverse student population.
The framework places a strong emphasis on conceptual understanding, critical thinking, and problem solving skills aligning with instructional approaches that promote deep mathematical understanding.
The framework supports equitable mathematics education by recognizing and valuing the diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds of all of our students, ensuring that all students have the opportunity to see themselves as capable mathematicians.
I commend the inclusion of the public throughout the entire process, as well as your dedication to providing students with a high quality mathematics education.
The proposed revisions are a testament to our collective commitment to excellence.
I urge the board to adopt the framework, ensuring a brighter and more equitable future for our students.
Thank you.

My name is Harding and I'm a former instructor of mathematics in North Carolina and I'm currently an instructional design specialist at data science for everyone.
I'm voicing my support for the California mathematics framework, specifically chapters five and eight.
In 2018, I was part of a team that adopted UC Berkeley's data eight course materials and adapted them for a standalone high school data science course for 11th and 12th grade students.
This course is available to North Carolina students online and is taught residentially across two campuses of the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics.
Since being introduced, student enrollment has increased in data science and AP statistics.
Students in the data science course learn valuable skills in the areas of computer programming, computational thinking, statistics, data science, and data literacy.
I urge the board to implement this framework.

I've served eight years on the local school board and as president.
As everyone knows, the MAEP scores have plunged across the nation.
Nothing in this framework will help the students have them raise their scores.
Nothing at all.
There's been no research to support what you are proposing today.
There's been very little transparency by this board.
I'm asking you to reject this today, extend the comment period, and allow more than 10 days in the middle of summer for people to comment on 900 pages.
This is not acceptable, and I suggest you have a Southern California hearing to help parents who could not come to this today or were not in touch with the program.
This is not equity in any way, shape, or form, maybe for some, not for all.
You are noting in Chapter 13 that you want publishers to put the equity lens on their lessons.

Hi, my name is Wynton Davies.
I'm a data practicing data scientist.
I have a PhD in computer science and machine learning.
My main comment would be that I support the proposal.
But I'd just like to point out to people that like currently California only requires two years of high school math to graduate high school, whereas UC requires three or four years worth of math.
I understand there's some contention about whether they will accept this data science course.
But clearly, if you can add one more course into a child's high school education that satisfies the UC math requirement, that has to be a win.
So that's my that's my comment.
And obviously, as a data scientist, I'm clearly in favor of people learning to do data science.
Thanks.

Yes. Hello, my name is Angela Torres.
I'm a secondary math educator for over 20 years currently working for the UC San Diego mathematics project supporting math teachers.
I strongly support the full revised draft framework and urge you to adopt it today.
I appreciate the attention to equity and expanding pathway options based on students interest and their decisions.
I understand the debate around data science and I support its explicitness in the framework.
Data science gives students a foundation of how to investigate data and use mathematics, statistics, technology and coding to interpret and predict within any context.
Attending to data science throughout the years or after a deep and expansive understanding of algebra and geometry prepare our students for rigorous third and fourth year mathematics courses and beyond.
This includes being prepared for pre-calculus through the attention of modeling the functions.
All students, especially those who have not yet found their place in mathematics, will benefit from data science and other advanced math courses in the proposed pathways that can prepare students for success post-secondary.
I encourage the State Board of Education to adopt today the revised draft framework as is so that we can continue to support our teachers across California and just support our students.
Thank you.

Hi, my name is Lai Bui and I'm a high school teacher at Mills High School in San Mateo County.
I'm here in support of data science in high school.
I've taught data science for three years using the course Cata curriculum.
This course is rigorous and lends itself to critical mathematical thinking and application.
Students who take this course range from students who finish calculus to students who finish geometry.
They have found success regardless of previous math course.
Students who normally don't like math end up enjoying math and want to continue taking more math classes.
Data science is relevant to students' lives and naturally lends itself to practical application and can be a way for students to see themselves as math people and potentially open doors to studying other advanced math classes.
Furthermore, data science provides the opportunity for students to develop data literacy, which is an important skill to have now.

Hi, we need to put aside all the feel-good rhetoric and focus on what works.
The evidence for this framework is inadequate.
I speak as a parent, a clinical neuropsychologist, and a neuroscientist.
In the over 60 pages of the Chapter 12 on assessment, there's no commitment to the ethical standards for educational and psychological testing.
I provided the link to this resource in my written comments.
This is a serious, serious ethical problem for the framework and it should be rejected.
Assessments are critical for identifying students' instructional needs and how they respond to what they learn.
In Palo Alto, teachers create tests that cause all students to fail and hence all are placed in the same classes.
This enforces delaning and avoids the refined assessments to identify what students need to learn.
Struggling students fail and feel bad and don't get the help they need.
Advanced students are held back and they're allowed to catch up in high school when grades are what determines getting into college.
It's anxiety provoking and sets kids up for serious mental health problems to cope with all the stress.
This structural holding kids back is a problem. Project the framework.

Hi, my name is Doris Tau. I'm a professor of neuroscience at UC Berkeley.
The experiment of removing algebra from middle school has already been done in SF Unified and it did not improve outcomes for black and Latino students at all.
As a scientist and mother of two five-year-olds, I'm profoundly confused why we're proposing to now do a large scale experiment on our children that has already been empirically demonstrated to not work.
I can't seem to find any discussion of the incredibly important and relative example of SF Unified in the draft framework.
It terrifies me that our STEM standards are being formulated by a group that doesn't grasp the basic scientific principle of paying attention to how previous experiments turned out.
I'm also curious about the data scientists supporting the proposed framework.
How can students understand the secret of machine learning without understanding the chain rule of calculus?

During Dr. Darling Hammond's earlier comments, she touted the framework suggested means to build that fluency.
Well, flag page 80 of chapter six.
It says timed activities are counterproductive.
Then check out the What Works Clearinghouse's teacher guide for assisting students struggling with math.
And the one recommendation they have listed for building fluency is timed activities.
That dog whistling within the framework of saying it's OK if students don't firmly know their math facts violates the aforementioned state standards.
Not teaching the standards violates students equal opportunity to an education.
A violation courts have shown to hold school districts accountable for.
The framework's dog whistling is actually very audible and it's trickling down quickly.
Just last year, a co-author of this framework presented about it to my district.
And part of the day was an article denigrating teachers about students learning their math facts.
And some of my colleagues want to ask our district to not have expectations of ground grade level math facts.
Reading the framework with an elementary lens, this thing immediately felt like a California U-cubed framework.
The edits since haven't changed that and won't achieve the equity that people think.

My name is Samantha Lieven. As a previous mathematics specialist for the Illinois State Board of Education,
a previous middle and high school educator and advocate for meaningful mathematics education,
I fully support the adoption of the mathematics framework and more specifically Chapter 5 and 8 on data science.
At a national level, California has the opportunity to be a lead in this work.
I would like to highlight the growing recognition of the importance of data science education in other states across the country.
Virginia has taken a significant step by creating and improving standalone data science standards,
acknowledging the skill set required to navigate and analyze data.
Utah is actively conducting a pilot program that includes standalone data science courses
accompanied by cohorts of professional development for teachers.
These initiatives, along with the widespread adoption of the data science courses code
created by the National School Courses for the Exchange of Data,
demonstrate the increasing nationwide recognition of the need to equip students with data science skills.
Almost half the country has either implemented the data science course or developed their own.
California can join these leading efforts and ensure that its students are prepared for the data-driven world
they will encounter in their academic and professional lives.

Thank you. Today I urge you to reject the proposed California math framework.
We must consider the parallels between the science of reading and the way we approach mathematics education.
The lack of citation of meaningful research around the science of learning and direct instruction in this framework is alarming.
Just as the science of reading has revealed the importance of explicit instruction and phonics,
we must recognize the significance of evidence-based direct instruction in mathematics.
Concepts such as retrieval practice, the expertise reversal effect, and cognitive load theory are well researched,
and incorporating them into the CMS will enhance outcomes.
Yet disappointingly, these critical elements have been overlooked in the proposed framework.
By neglecting to include them, we risk falling into the trap of equity theater rather than striving for true equity in education.
Equity cannot be achieved through mere symbolism.
It requires equipping students with the foundational skills necessary for success.
Math fluency, including a strong understanding of timetables, is a fundamental building block for mathematical proficiency.
Thank you. Your time is up. Thank you.

Would Will Parrish please line up at the back of the room?
You have one minute for public comment.
Thank you. Good afternoon. I'm Will Parrish, founder of Ten Strands, a California nonprofit focused on environmental literacy.
I'm also a former member of the Instructional Quality Commission.
I'd like to thank the State Board of Education and the California Department of Ed for including California's environmental principles and concepts,
the EPNCs, in the math framework per section 5122.7.3 of California's education code.
This follows the successful inclusion of the EPNCs in the history social science and the science and the health and the arts and world languages frameworks.
We're looking forward to the same for the upcoming ELA framework,
and we'll make ourselves available to support the State Board of Education and the California Department of Education at that time.
Congratulations to all involved for completing the math framework.
Thank you.
I take it this concludes public comment. Yes.
Given that there are no other public comments, I hereby close the public hearing at 453 p.m.
We'll now begin board discussion.
And as we begin that discussion, we probably want to put the recommendation slide up on the computer again.
I will just launch us by quoting one of our callers, yay for math.
That was my favorite quote of the day, but many we want to thank all of the people who called in.
There's been a lot of care and thought given to this framework, as you can see, and people really feel strongly about it.
I do want to point to a couple of factual matters that came out in the comments so that we just are all on that page.
One is that there was a comment about Appendix A and a concern about the first eight pages of Appendix A not showing the path to calculus.
One of the addendum recommendations is to delete those eight pages of Appendix A because they are both redundant with and not totally aligned with what's in Chapter 8.
And so we got that comment from a number of commenters, so those eight pages are now deleted and Chapter 8 does discuss and show the path to calculus.
One other just point of information about the addendum.
There is the concern that not everyone has seen where in the framework the ability to start the high school pathway, Algebra 1, Math 1, in eighth grade is stated.
And to be sure that that is clear everywhere, the addendum also points to Figure 8.4 and asks that we have a sort of an asterisked caption that says that the high school pathway can be begun and many students will begin it in eighth grade.
So that even though it's known as high school courses, that does not mean that they have to be started in ninth grade.
There is concern about the San Francisco plan.
It is not what this framework is based on.
That's why it's not mentioned in the framework.
I did look at Chapter 10 as one of the callers asked about reference to a common pathway there that seemed to suggest that you could not accelerate.
I could not find that set of words in Chapter 10, but if we do have places in the framework that are not aligned with each other, we can ask the CDE and state board staff as part of the technical edits to be sure that that clarity and alignment is there.
Finally, a lot of conversation about data science and it's wonderful that some people have had a good experience in it and appreciate that the decision about how data science will be taken up by college admissions is not our decision.
So while a lot of people have a lot of views about that, they should definitely be speaking to the board's committee and to the UCCSU governance around that.
So it's great that people have a lot of experiences with it.
Some have concerns.
Some have accolades.
I just want to be clear that the decision about how that course is taken up, we reference that decision in our framework and we will continue to try to be aligned to the UCCSU decisions about it.
It's not our decision, ultimately, whether those are admitted, you know, taken into consideration in admissions.
So those are just a few kind of factual points to give us a little bit of a start on our deliberations and I would like to open this up to board discussion.
All right.
Member Roscoe Gonzalez is going to kick us off.
I had tons of notes based on all our feedback and conversations.
And I'm going to take my mask off.
I want to just mention about this framework highlights the crucial role of teachers in establishing an equitable and engaging mathematics learning environment.
The emphasis on continuous professional learning and support for educators is commendable.
Actively engaging in continuous improvement using data and inquiry to address real world challenges enables educators to enhance their instructional practices and positively influence student outcomes.
I appreciate the recognition of the collaborative nature of education involving administrators, teacher leaders, parents, counselors and community members and fostering a supportive system.
The framework's focus on fundamental concepts, open ended tasks, justice, student inquiry, reasoning and justification aligns with effective mathematics, mathematics teaching practices.
I am encouraged by the incorporation of strategies to support diverse learners such as promoting multilingualism, facilitating group work, employing visual aids, establishing cultural connections and providing scaffolding and offering pre-learning opportunities.
Overall, this framework provides valuable guidance for professional growth and instruction and instruction promoting student achievement in mathematics.
I believe LEAs can consider fostering teacher led professional learning as teachers possess valuable expertise for their classroom experience and understand the diverse needs of their students.
This approach allows for tailored development, knowledge sharing and the dissemination of effective instructional practices.
It creates a sustainable model for continuous improvement and ensures that schools meet the evolving needs of their students.
I also listen to some of the callers and think that additionally while the framework offers guidance on supporting English learners and referencing the English language arts and ELD framework, ELD standards and strategies, there is an opportunity to further emphasize the alignment with ELD standards and the instructional materials within Chapter 13 under the Category 1.
Perfect. Thank you. And I do want to encourage Dr. Torres to return to the podium. We are likely to have some questions for you.
We did give you a rest for a couple of hours there, so you should be bright-eyed and bushy-tailed again.
And I do want to start with a question as I'm also going to go to the others on the panel.
There were a number of comments about Chapter 13 and the English language development standards potentially in Criterion 1.
I do see them under Criterion 4, and I just wonder if you could comment on why they show up in Criterion 4, not in Criterion 1, and how we should understand that.
Absolutely. Thank you so much for that opportunity. So we also have a two-hour presentation prepared for Instructional Materials Adoption.
I'll grab my flash drive. Okay, let me just make this really quick then.
This is like the Cliffs Notes version that in the Instructional Materials Adoption, there's specific evaluation criteria within Chapter 13 of the Mathematics Framework that will then guide that Instructional Materials Adoption.
And so that's called our evaluation criteria. We'll assemble those and train our reviewers on how to use that as a rubric to review the programs that have been submitted that they'll be tasked with reviewing when we do get to that stage.
But the important thing to note here is that of those five different categories, the first category is alignment to the standards related to that content area.
And so in Category 1, it's alignment to the mathematics standards because first and foremost, they're reviewing a mathematics program.
Now, it is great. Awesome. We want to make sure everyone has access to the Instructional Materials. Everybody has the support that they need.
That's why we have Category 4 in the Instructional Materials evaluation criteria.
Category 4 is related to ensuring that the Instructional Materials are accessible to all students, that there are the appropriate support for students.
It's a different question. Category 1, alignment to the standards for that content area.
Category 4, ability to support all students.
And so in Category 4, you'll notice in the mathematics framework in Chapter 13, there's multiple references to the English language development standards,
as well as meeting the needs of other populations of students like students with disabilities.
So there are provisions within the evaluation criteria that the reviewers will use to ensure that the materials are highly vetted.
And I do have to throw out there, and I would be remiss if our CD publisher liaison, who's probably listening right now,
will mention that all the publishers that he's worked with over the past, and I can't quote exactly how long he's been working for CDE,
have always said that California's Instructional Materials adoption has always been the most rigorous.
It's been the gold standard of publishers who do Instructional Materials adoptions across the country.
And so being the gold standard, we have an amazing setup where we do have the multiple ways to be able to evaluate material.
The one important thing to also note about alignment to the content standard is that it is a pass fail.
And so in Category 1, if a content developer or a publisher were to submit materials and there's standards missing, then that program will fail.
And it won't move on through the process, and it won't get, it'll be recommended for not approved to the IQC.
Then the IQC will recommend it for not approved to the state board.
You have to think about what is that program being evaluated for in that specific category,
and it really is alignment to the content area that it's designed to teach to, and that's mathematics.
Just a little bit, a little anecdote is that in the ELA ELD adoption that we held,
even in that adoption, it was alignment to English language arts standards for all programs,
with the exception for programs that were designated specifically for ELD.
And those were the only programs in which the ELD standards were applied for in Category 1.
So I'm hoping that provides a little bit of background to instructional materials adoption.
Thank you. Thank you for boiling it down to that succinct description and forgoing the two hour presentation.
I appreciate that. I think I see Member Yoshimoto-Tauri's hand up.
Are there others who I want to put in the queue? Member Rodriguez, Member Escobedo, Vice President Glover-Woods.
I just offered my hand because I had a follow-up to that question.
Dr. Torres, so I did a cursor review of the different frameworks as those questions kept coming up in public comment,
and it looks like true to what you said, it's about the alignment to the content standard.
In the science framework, however, there is a mention, so on page 1561,
Number 12 does mention that student assignments, this is Criteria 1, student assignments make linkages,
and it mentions various frameworks, including the ELD standards.
So it might be some language that we might want to revisit possibly if the board decides to delegate some clarity in the future.
That might be something, a way to do it.
So my comment really, again, thank you to all of the people who worked so hard on this.
I wanted to bring up Ms. Starling-Hammond, what you said, Board President, at the beginning about having a working group for mathematics,
and I just wanted to say I wholeheartedly support that idea of having a statewide mathematics working group.
The mathematics framework, in my opinion, is going to require all hands on deck,
and I wanted to give just a couple of examples from my experience when we think about the accelerated math pathways.
It's administrators and counselors that are really creating the scheduling for students,
and so they're using data provided by the data systems to do that.
They're also using class size norms and budget to help decide how many sections of each class they can have,
and sometimes well-intended policy can lead to exclusion.
If we do traditional policy and say these students who fit these criteria are eligible for this sort of pathway,
it might not result in the kinds of numbers and the kinds of equity that we want.
So I think that this working group can really help explore some of those really nuanced pieces
that are going to be important to the implementation of the framework.
And in addition, I think communication is also critical, so families understanding the options that are available,
because sometimes a student's willing to try for a pathway that might be a little harder than what they get scheduled for,
but they're willing to put in the effort and take acceleration or after-school courses to accelerate.
And then also I wanted to say that the STEM partners and the CTE kind of course report
that the students are applying the real-life math is super critical, so I hope in the working group
we can have people that have this range of experience that can help guide the work that's happening in LEAs
in addition to the teacher professional development that's going to happen as part of the rollout.
And just in closing, I wanted to just, again, I'm grateful to everybody who spoke today
and who had so much work to do with the framework,
but I did want to give special recognition to the young people who spoke earlier.
They drove six hours to be with us today to share in public comment,
and I thought having the voice of young people here sets a compelling vision for us for equity.
So thank you.
Thank you. Member Rodriguez.
Thank you so much, and thank you, Member Yoshimoto-Taurifort, acknowledging the young people.
That was also great to hear from them.
Yes, you deserve a round of applause because you love math.
And, you know, I want to say that this item before us represents a major change in the goal of math education
and the goal of our state education, and it's a very necessary change.
And I think that, you know, all of the callers who took the time to call in,
who have gone through this process reviewing the different iterations of the work that's been done here,
I commend everyone that has worked on this for hanging in there,
because I'm sure that there were times where you were like, this just doesn't add up.
Just trying to get that in there, huh?
However, however, you know, as I'm going through here and there's a particular,
in the beginning when we're talking about UDL principles and the way we make math accessible to our students,
I think about, I live on a border town, in a border community,
and I have students who tell me that they're not good in math.
And then I watch them as they convert huge amounts of dollars into pesos and they do it mentally.
And I'm standing there and my head's just spinning and I'm like, wow, and you're not good in math?
What if you were? And, you know, and there are occasions where they just,
and throughout, you know, classrooms or the way information was presented,
it felt out of their grasp in the classroom.
But outside of the classroom, they have the math gene, which according to Professor Devlin,
a mathematics professor at Stanford, emeritus, we all have the math gene, right?
You know, but there are different ways that we learn that maybe we're not math people, which is not true.
So that's what makes me really excited about these, this framework is that, you know, we can create the classrooms.
And I also want to acknowledge our CTA representative about, you know, the process of the TPEs,
the teacher preparation and all of the teacher support that will go into that mind shift, right?
You know, in creating those classrooms where everybody has access to this content, which is math is life.
It's everywhere. So thank you.
Right. We have Member Escobedo, Vice President Glover-Woods, Member Petillo-Bronson and Member Lewis.
Pretty much covered. I really wanted to emphasize the importance of Chapter 10,
and it was beautifully covered by Trustee Rodriguez already.
All right. Terrific. Thank you. What a good role model at 515.
Vice President Glover-Woods.
I don't know if I can follow that.
I know. I don't know. I don't know where to go with that after that.
But just a couple of comments and then a quick question, Dr. Torres.
One in relation to the instructional materials review, which I know is very robust and the process that the Instructional Quality Commission
utilizes is one that makes sure that all stones are turned and that we are ensured that it does align and meet the needs of students.
So my concern in question was related to ensuring that the math materials are aligning to the ELD standards
and actually making sure that our English learners are having the access necessary through the content.
But you answered that question, and I look forward to the instructional materials review process through the IQC,
which is also coupled with a public comment period as well.
So there is always opportunity for our communities to share their thoughts and opinions.
I do want to just make a request and then I have a question.
As the professional learning components begin to be developed with our county offices and other partners in relation to the math framework,
I do think it will be important for not just the teacher portion but any portion that is done with the community
to be sure it addresses any misperceptions of what is in the framework and what is being advocated and what is not.
Because I think even after the robust conversation we've had today,
there may still be some misperceptions of what is advocated and what is allowed and what is not.
So that professional learning rollout will be, I think, a very important piece in helping to ensure that our teachers understand as well as those in the community understand.
So my question is this.
Do we at this time have an idea of when the professional learning component will begin to undergo development in relation to the framework?
Should the framework be adopted today?
So currently those conversations are occurring.
There is no existing plan at this time to be able to share openly as far as what is in the rollout plan.
But we will be sure to be able to share that with the state, with the community, with the state board in communications as it's being developed.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
I wanted to start with an acknowledgement of the shared goal of increasing math achievement.
And I think we've heard a variety of perspectives on how to get there, but also just wanting to start with appreciation for how much passion people are bringing to that shared goal.
I also wanted to lift up that in the elementary early years instruction, the focus on student centered learning, experiential learning, conceptual understanding, which I think is oftentimes a little bit harder for many parents.
And I'll count myself in this category who learned more on an algorithmic sort of set of principles.
I think starting with the logic of math, of decomposing numbers, of understanding how to manipulate them and then moving to fluency and rapid recall, I think is fantastic and will also require some communication to families to understand where the ship needs to happen and why it's happening.
For the later years, I also appreciate the focus on data science, data analytics, and a focus on statistical awareness.
I think we've talked about it in terms of real world jobs of the future, understanding budgets, but also just wanted to connect the thread to some of our prior conversations around the seal of civic engagement and what it means to be a well informed voter to understand what the public policy issues are that voters are actually facing.
And I think these are real tools that actually arm a citizenry to actually think through the choices they'll be thinking through.
My question is one around clarity and alignment between chapters seven and eight.
So I think in the amendments we received this morning around chapter eight, there's effectively two pathways that are described on how to ensure that aspiring STEM students get to calculus by 12th grade for those students who choose to go that pathway and are interested in that pathway.
And it lays out a diagram with the traditional pathway as well as the integrated pathway.
I think the evidence base around Finland and South Korea around the integrated pathway is certainly I think exciting and also with an evidence base.
But for the language that accompanies the traditional pathway, there's now I think the inclusion of language stating that students may take algebra one in middle school as a pathway to get there, which I think is helpful, especially as you think about the transition time that will be necessary to move to an integrated pathway and the timetables that different school districts will pursue in getting there.
So my my clarity and alignment question is, is whether it would make sense to have something in chapter seven, which is the middle school chapter that actually makes at least a cross reference to say that this is still an available pathway, especially as districts are making a transition doing teacher training affecting TPEs.
Could I make a proposal around that? Absolutely. Yeah, I was just going to say that I think that falls under the category of what I was also saying earlier about making sure that our chapters are aligned to the same motion to the same set of notions and that we can designate that to CDE staff and SBE staff as they do the cleanup of the document.
So I think it's a similar similar comment that when we see the I think you've probably all looked at the motion, the proposed motion, which does both suggest the adoption of the append the addendum and designate to the CDE and SBE staff opportunity to make necessary revisions for the publication.
If there's anything that's outside the bounds of what's already in the framework, we'd need another amendment for it. But this is inside the bounds.
Okay, next on the list, we have member Lewis. Is there anybody else who's trying to get my attention? Which is flagging. I know we're all hanging in there. Remember Lewis.
Sorry.
The only thing that I would add about.
Just just a little humor to wake everybody up. Okay, so I first wanted to acknowledge and thank all of the the staff members, the different staff and everybody who's been involved in this process over the last four years in developing this framework work and getting us to this point.
And I also added that three of my five comments have already been covered or questions by other board members.
But the only thing I will add about the rollout of the professional development is to really emphasize the assistance that may be needed by LEAs and districts as they do awareness campaigns and inform the public and inform teachers.
Because even though this has been out for four years, there is still going to be very new information to a lot of different people in the communities.
And I remember being responsible for the awareness campaigns when the Common Core came out and how important and how many misconceptions there were about Common Core and what that meant.
So I think districts will really appreciate when that professional development plan and assistance is provided to them.
And also, I just wanted to to mention to any callers that might be listening and some of the concerns about pathways and acceleration, really the what the framework does is give autonomy to districts to work that out.
And so the community still has the opportunity to have input with their local districts when it comes to talking about pathways, talking about acceleration.
So that's the beauty of the framework. And I'll end with that.
Thank you.
I think we are potentially ready at this point for a motion.
We have the recommended action before us on the screen.
Vice President Glover Woods.
Okay, I move that we adopt the draft mathematics framework, including the revisions proposed in the response to the public feedback received during the second field review and since the posting for this board meeting, which I believe is inclusive of the addendum that we have as well.
Also, as part of the motion, I recommend that we delegate authority to the SBE and CDE staff to make any necessary revisions, including those revisions that are needed for clarity and accuracy as the document is professionally edited and prepared for publication.
Thank you very much.
Second member Rodriguez.
Any further discussion.
I would like to just add the thought that one of the things that came up in the comments were some questions about citations, and I would just like to add that as part of the potential necessary revisions for clarity and accuracy.
So just to be sure that that's all bundled in there.
Any further discussion.
All in favor.
Member Yoshimoto.
Sorry, are you trying to further discussion that to the last comment by board member Patel Bronson that whatever we also put in for integrated that that also get translated to Chapter 13 around the curriculum, curricular resources available for districts who decide to take that integrated pathway.
Because sometimes they're not equal resources offered for both pathways.
Great point.
All right, all in favor.
Say aye and raise your hand.
Aye.
Any opposed.
Any abstentions.
Motion carries.
Congratulations.
Congratulations. We have a new math framework.
And with that, I am going to thank Dr Mike Torres Cheryl cotton and everyone else who participated in getting this ready for us.
I appreciate you and I now adjourn the meeting.
We will meet tomorrow morning in closed session to discuss and or take action on the following legal matters.
Napa Valley Unified School District versus California State Board of Education, California School Boards Associations Education Legal Alliance versus California State Board of Education.
I hereby continue the meeting and in today's session at five twenty five p.m.
and look forward to seeing you tomorrow at eight thirty until then.
