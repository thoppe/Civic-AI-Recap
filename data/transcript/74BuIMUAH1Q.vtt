WEBVTT

00:01.192 --> 00:04.754
Okay, the State Board will come to order and convene.

00:06.155 --> 00:10.238
We're going to have as our first item of business a closed session.

00:10.978 --> 00:16.322
So now that you're all seated and this is always awkward, we need to ask you to leave.

00:17.823 --> 00:24.547
And so the Board will be moving to closed session to discuss or take action on the following cases.

00:24.947 --> 00:30.151
MSC, CAPEEM versus Torlakson,

00:30.971 --> 00:37.836
and California School Boards Association versus the State Board of Education, the Aspire litigation.

00:37.996 --> 00:44.701
So if we could clear the room and the board, we'll then go into executive session and talk with our legal team.

00:55.222 --> 01:12.647
Okay, the State Board will reconvene and we will hear at this point item 18, which is the proposed formation of a new unified school district from the Huron portion of the Coalinga-Huron Unified School District in Fresno County.

01:13.928 --> 01:14.008
And

01:15.208 --> 01:30.020
Before we begin, I'm going to announce in closed session the board discussed and or took action on the following cases, MSC, CAPPEM versus Torlakson and CSBA versus SBE, the Aspire case.

01:30.701 --> 01:42.711
So, Larry Shirey is here to present the item and then we'll have board member technical questions and then we'll have our public hearing and go from there.

01:42.911 --> 01:43.131
Go ahead.

01:47.790 --> 01:49.271
Okay, I think we've got a PowerPoint.

01:49.291 --> 01:50.892
I don't know if it's up right now.

01:50.992 --> 01:52.333
It's right there in front of us.

01:56.956 --> 02:01.259
Good morning, President Kerr, Superintendent Torlakson, board members.

02:02.000 --> 02:02.320
Mike.

02:04.341 --> 02:04.701
Is it on?

02:05.002 --> 02:05.302
Yes.

02:05.602 --> 02:06.903
Okay, I just wasn't close enough.

02:07.783 --> 02:09.905
I'm Larry Shirey, School Fiscal Services Division.

02:10.971 --> 02:20.460
This morning, we have a petition to form a new unified school district from the Huron portion of the Coalinga-Huron Unified School District in Fresno County.

02:24.284 --> 02:34.174
As the name suggests, the Coalinga-Huron District serves students from two communities in Fresno County, Coalinga and Huron.

02:35.582 --> 02:40.744
The petition was signed by 25% of the voters in the Huron community.

02:41.264 --> 02:46.106
They have a number of reasons for wanting to break away and form their own new district.

02:47.267 --> 02:52.189
One is the belief that the Huron community is very different and separate from the Coalinga community.

02:53.049 --> 02:59.432
They're more real, they're more rural in nature, less affluent, and more heavily minority.

03:00.192 --> 03:04.134
The distance, another issue is that the distance that high school students have to

03:05.396 --> 03:08.819
take a trip on the bus to the high school.

03:09.059 --> 03:11.602
There's only one high school in Coalinga, Huron.

03:11.642 --> 03:18.168
It's in Coalinga, so Huron students have to, and it's about 20 miles away from the city of Huron.

03:18.788 --> 03:25.795
So petitioners are concerned about the bus ride of about 300 students from Huron that go to the high school.

03:26.556 --> 03:30.179
They say that bus ride can take up to an hour one way.

03:31.246 --> 03:37.534
And finally, the way the governing board for Koalinga Huron is elected is by two trustee areas.

03:38.075 --> 03:45.204
There are three trustee areas, three trustees from the Koalinga area and two from the Huron community.

03:45.902 --> 03:56.105
The Huron community feels that with that minority representation on the board, that they are, they sometimes, their needs are not represented by board decisions.

03:56.425 --> 04:03.227
So those are, I mean, there are some other reasons, but those are the three primary reasons why the community is seeking to form its own school district.

04:04.948 --> 04:11.790
The county superintendent determined that the petition was sufficient and transmitted it to the Fresno County Committee.

04:12.250 --> 04:14.231
Just a quick note on the Fresno County Committee.

04:15.259 --> 04:21.262
Most county committees in the state have had their authority transferred to the County Board of Education.

04:21.862 --> 04:27.825
In Fresno County, as with most larger counties in the state, there still is a separate county committee.

04:27.865 --> 04:28.985
It's an 11-member body.

04:29.486 --> 04:33.447
Two members from each county supervisorial district and one member at large.

04:34.228 --> 04:38.770
The county committee is elected by board members from all the school districts in the county.

04:42.608 --> 04:45.430
The County Committee conducted two public hearings on the petition.

04:46.771 --> 04:56.538
Staff from the Fresno County Superintendent's Office performed and prepared a review of the nine minimum threshold conditions.

04:57.919 --> 05:01.322
And we'll talk more about those conditions in a moment.

05:01.982 --> 05:10.869
The County Committee found that four of those minimum threshold standards were not met and subsequently recommended that the State Board disapprove the proposal.

05:20.660 --> 05:23.402
This is a visual depiction of the area.

05:24.844 --> 05:32.570
As you can see, the whole of the Coalinga-Huron district is not portrayed here to the west and the north.

05:33.391 --> 05:36.754
There is considerable Mount Diablo mountain range.

05:37.054 --> 05:40.397
We're not showing that just to provide a little more clarity.

05:41.358 --> 05:45.201
Highway 5 runs from northwest to southeast right through the center.

05:45.925 --> 05:52.151
of the map, the Huron community is in gold to the east and the Coalinga community is in green to the west.

05:53.173 --> 06:01.861
And the solid black line that starts from the top in the upper left-hand corner is the proposed boundary, the proposed split of the district into Coalinga and Huron.

06:02.923 --> 06:03.283
Excuse me?

06:04.965 --> 06:06.606
Yeah, we're not getting colors, are we?

06:07.808 --> 06:08.188
Oh, you're not?

06:19.989 --> 06:25.452
So these green areas here are incorporated Coalinga.

06:26.253 --> 06:28.014
This gold area here is Huron.

06:29.295 --> 06:33.717
This is the boundary of the Unified School District.

06:34.958 --> 06:37.960
This is Highway 5 running down through the district.

06:38.700 --> 06:48.526
And this solid black line is the boundary that the Huron petition is proposing be the dividing line between a Huron portion

06:49.144 --> 06:52.765
a Huron Unified School District and a Coalinga Unified School District.

06:53.626 --> 06:54.466
Okay, thanks.

06:54.746 --> 06:55.206
That's clear.

06:55.306 --> 06:57.627
Now, let me just stay here for a couple more minutes.

06:58.727 --> 07:01.848
There are some concerns about this boundary on the Coalinga side.

07:02.729 --> 07:04.389
The City Council is concerned.

07:04.910 --> 07:12.752
Coalinga City Council is concerned because, you know, it incorporates, it takes in some of the Coalinga territory, city territory.

07:13.633 --> 07:17.374
It moves very close to the city's sphere of influence.

07:18.291 --> 07:26.755
The Koalinga Huron School District is concerned because, you know, these areas here are all oil fields, very, you know, high assessed valuation.

07:27.455 --> 07:35.579
So they're concerned that the boundaries are taking a disproportionate percentage of the assessed valuation of the district.

07:44.929 --> 07:50.232
This is a depiction of the student, proposed student population of the two districts.

07:50.992 --> 07:54.294
You know, we're looking at the elementary, middle and high school levels.

07:55.075 --> 08:02.999
Just as a note, we're not including the 93 students who are in the continuation high schools and special day, just for clarity purposes.

08:04.060 --> 08:06.441
Coalinga-Huron currently has about 4,400 students.

08:09.172 --> 08:22.740
proposed district, you can see the splits down there, it's about 30, 38, 39 percent of the total Coalinga-Huron school district would be in the Huron, a new Huron district in the remainder, in the remaining portion of Coalinga.

08:26.822 --> 08:28.103
So here's what we're going to do today.

08:29.243 --> 08:33.606
I'll present the CDE's findings on the nine minimum standards

08:36.272 --> 08:41.794
As I relate to the proposal, and again, these are minimum threshold conditions that the Education Code establishes.

08:43.214 --> 08:49.556
However, the Education Code does provide the State Board with considerable flexibility in handling these things.

08:50.096 --> 08:53.717
You can, even if you find them not met,

08:54.865 --> 09:08.233
any one of the conditions not met, you can still move the proposal forward because you can determine that the exceptional circumstance applies or the conditions can't literally be applied to this particular reorganization.

09:11.295 --> 09:14.697
After I've finished with the presentation, you hold a public hearing.

09:17.839 --> 09:19.040
Let me move ahead.

09:20.081 --> 09:22.022
And then you'll take action.

09:22.620 --> 09:23.881
after you've heard public comment.

09:24.681 --> 09:27.303
Now, you cannot approve the proposal today.

09:28.344 --> 09:33.127
This is a project under the California Environmental Quality Act.

09:34.487 --> 09:37.469
That needs to be satisfied before you can approve the project.

09:38.110 --> 09:46.535
What you can do is you can disapprove it or you can find that there's a compelling reason or it has merit and move it forward.

09:47.128 --> 09:52.611
And moving forward means that we'll send it back to the local level to comply with CEQA.

09:53.412 --> 09:57.334
And then once that's taken care of, it'll come back to the state board for final action.

09:57.934 --> 10:06.339
So again, in summary, your choices are going to be disapprove or consider it has merit and send it back for further action.

10:11.650 --> 10:16.314
Okay, now on to the nine minimum standards.

10:17.695 --> 10:26.722
Four of the conditions didn't have any significant, really significant local concerns when locally or in our opinion.

10:27.303 --> 10:29.484
One is that the district will be of adequate size.

10:30.365 --> 10:39.472
The regulations that the state board has adopted tell you that a unified district needs to be 1,501 students.

10:39.973 --> 10:40.834
It meets that condition.

10:41.604 --> 10:50.771
that there's a substantial community identity in the reorganization, you know, with the Huron and Koalinga split, you know, everyone believes that that community identity condition is met.

10:51.431 --> 10:54.193
There will be no significant increases in cost to the state.

10:54.213 --> 11:06.443
You know, this is really kind of a condition that doesn't, not a lot of things increase cost to state, unless you're dealing with basic aid districts or necessary small school funding.

11:06.463 --> 11:09.345
So, everyone believes that that condition is met.

11:09.878 --> 11:12.118
and it's not designed to increase property values.

11:12.479 --> 11:20.700
This is usually a condition that's applied to territory transfers when you're moving from one district to a district that's perceived to be more affluent.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.241
So, that doesn't really apply much here.

11:23.861 --> 11:28.142
We agree with the county committee that all these conditions are substantially met.

11:30.883 --> 11:36.084
Now, the next condition we're going to talk about is the division of assets.

11:36.124 --> 11:37.004
Whenever a district

11:37.947 --> 11:46.031
is split, as is proposed in this case, there has to be a plan to divide the assets of, in this case, the Coal Inca Huron School District.

11:47.132 --> 11:57.097
The Fresno County Committee found this condition met, but there were some local concerns that were raised around this condition, and I just want to briefly touch on those.

11:58.618 --> 12:04.101
The Education Code establishes standards or default methods to divide

12:05.117 --> 12:08.798
various assets and obligations of a district when it's reorganized.

12:09.578 --> 12:18.401
It also provides that the State Board of Education has considerable flexibility in terms of adjusting those default standards.

12:18.741 --> 12:22.022
If you find that there would be a more equitable way to do that.

12:22.543 --> 12:27.404
So keep that in mind as we go through all the conditions and especially this one.

12:29.545 --> 12:31.806
The first issue we have is that the

12:33.482 --> 12:47.794
Huron petitioners believe that they should have access to a proportionate share of the unissued or the approved but unissued bond funds of the Cole and Gaheron District.

12:50.035 --> 12:57.521
Whenever a bond measure is approved, you establish a bond cap, which in statute is defined as two and a half percent of the assessed valuation.

12:58.102 --> 13:00.204
That's kind of like the credit limit on your credit card.

13:01.385 --> 13:01.805
And then when

13:02.349 --> 13:16.235
the district, you know, the voters have approved that bond limit, but then when the district issues or sells a bond issue, that becomes like, that becomes debt, a bond in a debtor's, it's like debt on your credit card, a charge on your credit card.

13:17.095 --> 13:28.619
So we're going to talk about how the debt part should be divided in a moment, but right now let's just talk about that remaining credit limit that the coal indicator on district would have.

13:32.031 --> 13:43.214
The Fresno County Committee does not find any support in the Education Code to divide the credit limit, divide the approved but unissued bonds.

13:43.294 --> 13:44.074
We agree with that.

13:45.214 --> 13:51.576
There is no standard set in the Education Code how to divide that as there is with other assets and obligations.

13:52.276 --> 14:00.358
There is no authority in the Education Code for the State Board to find some other equitable way to divide this and there is no

14:01.932 --> 14:10.059
approval or no standard in the code to allow such a division to be part of the plans and recommendations of a reorganization proposal.

14:10.599 --> 14:18.826
So it's our opinion that all of the unissued bond funds would remain with the remaining Koolinga Huron School District.

14:21.548 --> 14:31.316
The second issue, and again we're going to provide a little more clarity, is the issue of how to divide

14:31.986 --> 14:35.967
the debt that the district does have, the bonded indebtedness.

14:37.328 --> 14:39.188
The Education Code provides a standard.

14:39.688 --> 14:54.473
It says that any district pulling away, in this case the Huron district, would be liable for the greater of the amount of bond funds that were spent on facilities that exist in the Huron community or

14:55.216 --> 15:00.718
the proportionate share of bonded indebtedness based on the assessed valuation.

15:01.058 --> 15:10.981
So, if they're pulling, in this case, 59% of the assessed valuation out of Coalinga-Huron, that's going to be the greater under the Education Code.

15:11.361 --> 15:19.343
Therefore, the Huron District would be responsible for 59% of the outstanding bonded indebtedness

15:25.250 --> 15:34.997
They write, they will have about 38% of the kids and about 59% of the assessed valuation, therefore 59% of the bond.

15:36.118 --> 15:47.687
Now the petitioners, as I mentioned before, you have authority to propose a more equitable distribution if you think it's warranted.

15:47.727 --> 15:51.130
The petitioners, as I'm sure they will tell you, think that that's warranted.

15:51.590 --> 15:53.732
We disagree for three reasons.

15:54.542 --> 16:20.168
Number one is that when you pull out so much bonded indebtedness from the remaining Koalinga school district, then what's going to happen with that portion, that new district or that reorganized district, is that the amount of bond debt they have is going to exceed their bond cap.

16:20.689 --> 16:22.009
So they're going to have difficulty

16:24.002 --> 16:28.625
accessing bond funds to address future issues.

16:28.925 --> 16:42.472
Now, of course, you know that they could submit a waiver and get that bond cap raised, but there's some other concerns with that because it's also going to affect what the voters, what the property owners in the district have to pay in property taxes.

16:43.352 --> 16:44.393
And that's our second issue.

16:47.859 --> 16:54.981
If the bond, the assessed valuation is the lifeblood of funding facilities in the school district.

16:55.781 --> 17:12.826
If you pull a disproportionate amount of assessed valuation out of the district, that means that you're taking away from the remaining Coalinga district, Coalinga-Huron district, the Coalinga portion, the ability to pay for existing bond debt.

17:14.349 --> 17:20.774
which means property taxes are going to go up significantly on the remaining property owners in the Coalinga area.

17:22.135 --> 17:24.196
So, that can create a couple of problems.

17:24.376 --> 17:33.563
One, it could, if it goes up too much, it might violate some of the issues that the voters approved in approving the bond.

17:34.143 --> 17:41.148
And it also would make us have to consider what the voting area is going to be at this proposal.

17:41.389 --> 17:43.070
The default voting area would be

17:44.056 --> 17:48.878
if you approve it and if it goes back to the county for a vote would just be the Huron community.

17:49.619 --> 18:01.444
But if there's going to be a significant effect on property owners in the Coalinga, the remaining portion of the district in the Coalinga portion, then we would have to consider what that effect is.

18:01.484 --> 18:10.449
It may cause us to recommend and you to expand the election area to include the whole Coalinga Huron school district.

18:11.169 --> 18:12.470
The third issue is that

18:14.187 --> 18:21.371
the Huron students use more than just the facilities that are in Huron and specifically the Koalinga High School.

18:22.051 --> 18:31.076
And they will continue to use the high school for up to five years after if they were to form as a new district while they build their own high school district.

18:31.276 --> 18:38.840
So they are deriving, they would, they are and they would continue to derive a benefit from the Koalinga High School.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.421
And a significant portion of the bond funds

18:42.054 --> 18:45.617
used by Cole and Gaheron have been used for the high school.

18:56.025 --> 18:56.625
Are we still on?

18:57.866 --> 18:58.167
OK.

18:59.728 --> 19:00.929
I think I've lost it here.

19:05.532 --> 19:05.873
There it is.

19:09.022 --> 19:19.310
Now we're going to turn our attention to, so in summary, the Fresno County Committee found this division of asset conditions substantially met.

19:19.410 --> 19:27.056
We agree as long as the standard in the Education Code for dividing bonded indebtedness are used.

19:27.936 --> 19:36.683
If the State Board should consider another method of dividing the bonded indebtedness, then we might have to reconsider what our recommendation is in this condition.

19:38.339 --> 19:40.701
Now, we're going to move to the three other conditions.

19:41.241 --> 19:41.702
I'm sorry.

19:43.483 --> 19:44.084
Yeah, never mind.

19:44.184 --> 19:47.706
Now, we're going to move to the four remaining conditions.

19:48.707 --> 19:54.632
The first one is the issue of preserving the ability to educate students in an integrated environment.

19:59.936 --> 20:02.798
Koalinga-Huron currently is a heavily minority district, 89.5%.

20:08.170 --> 20:17.915
We're not going to focus much on the elementary and middle school populations here because their populations are not going to change as a result of the reorganization.

20:18.655 --> 20:27.839
The elementary schools in Huron currently serve the students in Huron, the elementary schools in Coalinga and the middle schools currently serve the students in Coalinga.

20:29.040 --> 20:32.941
The issue that we have is with Coalinga High School, which currently is about 88.5% minority.

20:36.681 --> 20:45.266
The proposed reorganization would move those percentages as portrayed on the screen.

20:45.746 --> 20:49.689
A proposed Huron High School would be pretty much 100% minority.

20:49.869 --> 20:56.353
Currently, right now, there is only one non-minority student at Coalinga High School from the Huron community.

20:57.013 --> 21:01.276
The remaining Coalinga High School would be about 82%, about a 16.5% drop, percentage point drop.

21:04.758 --> 21:17.827
So, we're recommending this condition is not substantially met because it inhibits the ability of the districts to ensure that students are integrated or educated in an integrated environment.

21:18.568 --> 21:23.612
Now, there are a number of other issues that you can look at here and that we talked about in our report.

21:24.472 --> 21:33.539
One is that the situation currently exists with the elementary and middle schools.

21:34.389 --> 21:35.510
in Kualinga and Huron.

21:36.270 --> 21:41.774
There's no moving students from Huron to Kualinga or vice versa.

21:42.335 --> 21:51.561
So the student population in Kualinga reflects the population, the general population of Kualinga, and the same for the Huron area.

21:56.297 --> 21:58.497
Can you be more specific what you mean by minority?

21:59.158 --> 22:08.459
Because it could be, I know the ethnic student subgroups, but I'm trying to really paint a picture as to why this proposal and why folks feel underrepresented.

22:08.939 --> 22:21.222
So I'm thinking of the great divide between Watts and Southgate down in Los Angeles, where now both communities are predominantly Latino, but they still feel very different.

22:22.182 --> 22:29.945
So when we're talking about minority, are we saying African-American, Latinos, or is it predominantly Latinos and still divisions within the Latino community?

22:30.305 --> 22:39.549
Yeah, well, you know, our standard is that we need in this conditions that we need to look at all minority students compared to white students.

22:40.049 --> 22:48.973
So in this particular case, in Coldinga, you know, the vast majority of minority students are Latino or Hispanic.

22:49.873 --> 22:50.594
Is that the question?

22:52.008 --> 22:53.529
I'm trying to figure out the demographic profile.

22:53.569 --> 22:56.452
So is it 99.8% Latinos?

22:56.852 --> 23:00.395
Is it 80% Latino and 10% African-American?

23:01.736 --> 23:03.198
I don't have the numbers in front of me.

23:03.238 --> 23:06.981
I think we put them in our report, but it's in the upper 80%.

23:08.242 --> 23:13.506
Upper 80, 88 or so percent are Hispanic or Latino students.

23:13.526 --> 23:17.710
So it's almost all the students, all the minority students.

23:18.689 --> 23:21.650
If you want, I can go through the report and get the exact numbers.

23:21.710 --> 23:25.792
But it's very, very predominantly Hispanic or Latino.

23:31.375 --> 23:40.359
So, as I was saying, this condition that we are concerned about at the high school level currently exists at the elementary and middle schools.

23:41.680 --> 23:46.222
You know, there have been no efforts by the district in the past to, you know, to adjust that.

23:47.191 --> 23:53.233
But they do have the ability to do that based on the current arrangement.

23:53.553 --> 23:56.094
They would lose that if the districts are separate.

23:56.754 --> 24:08.618
Similarly, as most areas in the state, the minority, in this case Hispanic or Latino population, is increasing while the number of white students go down.

24:08.718 --> 24:13.560
So the Cola Ninga Huron School District right now is becoming more minority.

24:15.265 --> 24:21.946
And also there's the issue of the, you know, one of the things we look at is the feasibility of providing an integrated environment.

24:22.346 --> 24:27.867
Right now it's happening because the students in Huron are being bused into Kualinga.

24:28.387 --> 24:42.030
So, you know, that's, you might want to take that into consideration about, in terms of the busing and the busing time in terms of determining whether or not it's feasible to provide education in an integrated environment.

24:42.708 --> 24:47.672
But anyway, we agree with the Fresno County Committee that this condition is not substantially met.

24:50.134 --> 24:55.458
The next condition is that the proposal will continue to promote sound educational performance.

24:56.539 --> 24:58.160
I'm going to break for a moment.

24:58.300 --> 24:59.541
My allergies are killing me.

24:59.581 --> 25:00.922
I'm going to put a throat lozenge in.

25:07.587 --> 25:10.510
The Coalinga-Huron District is a lower performing district.

25:11.434 --> 25:16.098
If you look at the five by five grid, you have the new accountability system.

25:17.018 --> 25:22.943
You're going to see a lot of orange and red squares for both the district and the school level.

25:24.566 --> 25:27.527
The district also has a very high percentage of disadvantaged students.

25:28.107 --> 25:31.647
It kind of, it differs between Huron and the community.

25:31.948 --> 25:48.711
And the Coalinga community is kind of reflected by what the concerns that the Huron community stated in their reasons for wanting to form their own new district, their own district, that they are a more, they are less affluent than the Coalinga area.

25:52.220 --> 25:58.848
But the primary, and again, that there's really not going to be much change at the middle and the elementary school level here.

25:59.449 --> 26:07.858
The primary issue is what happens with the high school and that was the concern that was stated at the local level and by the Fresno County Committee.

26:08.819 --> 26:18.865
They found this condition not met because they believed that the reorganization would take a small high school and then form two smaller high schools.

26:19.265 --> 26:27.950
And those two smaller high schools would not be able to provide the same level of educational program and activities as the larger Coaldinka High School.

26:29.130 --> 26:36.134
You know, we're not in a position to speculate in terms of what kind of program a new Huron district would offer.

26:37.057 --> 26:45.661
But what we did is try to take a look at some general issues related to schools, high schools that are similar to what a Huron high school might be.

26:46.361 --> 26:53.584
Similar for us meant a high school that was between 400 and 500 students, was in a rural area and was not a charter high school.

26:54.625 --> 27:05.810
So we did an online review of those schools, looking at SARCs and school websites and other objective

27:06.858 --> 27:17.013
online websites and we found that the number and variety of courses offered by those high schools was very similar to what Koalinga High School offers.

27:18.015 --> 27:21.880
They offer similar extracurricular activities, especially in terms of band and

27:22.546 --> 27:26.371
and FFA and athletic issues.

27:26.772 --> 27:31.177
All the schools we looked at could field both a varsity and junior varsity football team.

27:31.758 --> 27:35.283
So that's kind of my standard for athletics.

27:38.624 --> 27:47.289
Our opinion is that the enrollment levels would not prevent the reorganized high schools from offering numerous and diverse curricular and extracurricular options.

27:47.689 --> 27:55.014
Therefore, we're breaking from the Fresno County Committee who found that this condition was not met and we believe that this condition is substantially met.

27:59.376 --> 28:02.778
The next issue is the facility cost.

28:03.939 --> 28:07.281
If Huron forms a new district, they have to build a high school.

28:08.305 --> 28:10.066
And they have five years to build a high school.

28:10.086 --> 28:23.395
If they don't get it done in five years, then it comes back to the state board and the state board either reverts them back, reverts the whole, the two districts back to a single Coalinga-Huron, or we'll give them more time to build a high school.

28:25.656 --> 28:34.462
Our estimate based on what a 500 student high school would require and current school construction costs,

28:34.966 --> 28:39.330
is that it would take $35 million to build a high school.

28:40.291 --> 28:43.253
There are also going to be other facility needs in Huron.

28:43.273 --> 28:48.058
They're going to need administration support, maintenance operation services.

28:48.878 --> 28:53.843
They're going to have to address special education, alternative education issues.

28:54.443 --> 28:58.247
Also, the elementary school in Huron is

28:58.912 --> 29:02.855
uses a lot of portables is getting pretty close to capacity.

29:03.375 --> 29:20.288
So if there is any future development, substantial or significant future development here on area, then they're likely going to need a new elementary school or at least some renovation and some additions to the existing elementary school.

29:21.329 --> 29:25.472
The other issue that concerns us is the capacity of the current

29:26.328 --> 29:29.290
capacity usage of the current Coalinga High School.

29:29.791 --> 29:33.554
Currently, that high school is operating at about 61% capacity.

29:34.434 --> 29:39.238
If you pull the students out, it's going to be operating at less than 40% capacity.

29:39.859 --> 29:52.028
So what we see is a situation where you have a lot of surplus capacity in the district and a lot of cost to build a new high school.

29:52.793 --> 30:04.204
when really, if you look at it in the terms of the Kuala Lunga Huron High School, there's no justification for building the high school, given the capacity of the existing Kuala Lunga High School.

30:04.604 --> 30:14.714
And therefore, the condition which states that the cost, facilities cost, will be insignificant and incidental to the reorganization, that condition is not substantially met.

30:15.680 --> 30:23.723
Now, we take that condition because the state board has the authority to say there are exceptional circumstances and this condition doesn't apply.

30:24.303 --> 30:38.088
We take that condition another step because we want to look at what funds the Huron School District would have available if they were formed to build a high school.

30:39.328 --> 30:43.490
And we find that they would have very limited available funding for facilities.

30:44.226 --> 30:47.167
They would have a bonding capacity of $31.5 million.

30:48.167 --> 30:55.989
But the liability for outstanding bond debtors that we talked about would reduce that bonding capacity by $13.5 million.

30:56.449 --> 31:01.770
So they would be left with $18 million in bonding capacity.

31:02.330 --> 31:10.472
Additionally, we have, as you know, there was a school bond approved by the California voters last November.

31:12.445 --> 31:17.888
We don't know how much of that money is going to be available for the Huron District.

31:17.968 --> 31:19.649
We can't speculate on that.

31:19.729 --> 31:31.156
It's going to be at least three years until this new district could go online and start thinking about building a high school, given the fact that it has to, if you move it forward, it has to go through CEQA.

31:31.216 --> 31:33.697
It has to come back here for review and there has to be an election.

31:34.298 --> 31:37.619
So, the earliest that this new school district could form would be 2020, July 1st.

31:40.581 --> 31:45.524
You know, so we think and we look at the surplus capacity issues.

31:46.124 --> 31:55.870
We look at the significant increase in facility cost and the additional construction needs that are likely and the limited funding sources that have been identified.

31:57.110 --> 31:59.792
And we find that this condition is not substantially met.

32:02.435 --> 32:14.282
The next condition is the effect the reorganization would have on the fiscal status of the districts, both the remaining Coalinga district, portion of the district and a New Huron district.

32:15.723 --> 32:25.349
The county committee found that this condition was not substantially met, primarily because creating a new district would cause new administrative costs.

32:25.390 --> 32:30.853
They'd have to duplicate the administration, board, maintenance and operations, all of that stuff.

32:31.642 --> 32:39.606
And they found that that additional cost for them was enough to find this condition not substantially met.

32:40.206 --> 32:41.727
We take a slightly different approach.

32:42.467 --> 32:51.192
You know, when we look at formations of new school districts, we don't automatically assume that additional cost means that it's a negative fiscal impact.

32:52.156 --> 32:58.641
the governing board of a new district is going to have some opportunity to, you know, adjust budgets, etc.

32:58.681 --> 33:05.887
So we do not consider additional cost as the primary or only reason to find that this condition is not substantially met.

33:06.488 --> 33:10.871
Instead, what we did is we ran some funding scenarios based on 2015-16 and 2016-17 school year.

33:10.931 --> 33:11.472
And we find that

33:18.214 --> 33:31.866
under LCFF transition rules for calculating the funding, the New Huron School District would receive a lower proportionate share of the LCFF than you would think they should.

33:31.886 --> 33:39.532
And that's because under transition funding rules, we can't touch categorical funding.

33:40.493 --> 33:41.794
So it's about a three.

33:43.237 --> 33:52.080
would stay completely with, all the categorical funding is going to stay completely with the remaining portion of Coalinga-Huron School District.

33:52.400 --> 33:54.821
That's about a 3% reduction in funding.

33:58.022 --> 34:05.004
So, in our scenario, in 2015-16, Huron District is deficit spending.

34:06.324 --> 34:09.125
The remaining Coalinga District would be running a slight surplus.

34:10.826 --> 34:11.406
The next year,

34:12.344 --> 34:19.107
Deficit spending would increase in Huron and the district would not be able to meet its minimum reserve for economic uncertainties.

34:20.548 --> 34:23.850
The remaining portion of Coalinga would also be deficit spending at this point.

34:24.970 --> 34:39.098
And those fiscal concerns would be exacerbated by any additional expenses that the new district would incur for administrative structure, maintenance and operations and any other costs that would accrue from becoming a new school district.

34:40.258 --> 34:41.779
So we agree with the County Committee.

34:43.103 --> 34:45.125
that this condition is not substantially met.

34:46.005 --> 34:51.010
So in summary, we find that three of the nine conditions are not substantially met.

34:51.030 --> 34:56.134
It does not preserve the ability to educate students in an integrated environment.

34:56.815 --> 35:02.279
School facility cost will not be insignificant and incidental.

35:02.319 --> 35:08.865
They will be significant and primary to the reorganization.

35:09.742 --> 35:16.825
And the other condition we find not met is that there'll be no substantial negative impact on the fiscal management or fiscal status of the districts.

35:18.445 --> 35:21.586
So, our recommendations are that these three conditions are not met.

35:22.627 --> 35:28.169
We don't find a compelling reason or exceptional circumstance to justify moving the proposal forward.

35:28.989 --> 35:34.871
And we support the Fresno County's unanimous recommendation to disapprove this proposal.

35:37.358 --> 35:48.442
So you'll hold a public hearing and then when you come back after the public hearing, if the state board agrees with our recommendations, you should disapprove the formation of the new unified school district.

35:49.143 --> 35:59.387
If you disagree with our recommendations and you find that there's a compelling reason to move the unification forward, we will then transmit the proposal to Fresno County for CEQA compliance.

36:01.748 --> 36:02.508
And that's it.

36:03.530 --> 36:05.171
Now, I'm here to answer questions.

36:05.191 --> 36:08.913
If you have questions now that you want to pose to me, I'd be happy to answer them.

36:09.413 --> 36:13.796
Or you can wait until after the public hearing when you start discussing the issue.

36:14.996 --> 36:21.560
So, I would like Board Member Holliday, if you want to speak now or wait till after, you're the liaison for this area.

36:22.185 --> 36:22.505
Thank you.

36:22.545 --> 36:23.766
I just had a couple of questions.

36:25.426 --> 36:49.017
When you were speaking about the drive time, the busing from Huron over to Coalinga, I believe in prior conversations that we've had about this topic, you indicated that actually there are a number of students in the Huron proposed district.

36:50.358 --> 36:59.240
who are closer to the current high school than other students within the Koalinga proposed.

36:59.844 --> 37:10.387
Well, I think the issue we discussed was the geographic size of what the Huron School District could be and the uncertainty about where they would be able to build a high school in Huron.

37:11.047 --> 37:23.710
So that given that the geographic, you know, it's I don't know how many miles it is from the east to the west, the west boundaries of the proposed Huron School District, but there's likely going to be transportation.

37:24.490 --> 37:44.780
Cost and transportation of students in a district that that's that are similar to the transportation times that we have now and won't be as many students involved depending again depending on where they where the new district is able to build a build its high school, but Just the fact that the district is as large would be as large.

37:44.880 --> 37:46.381
It's a large rural area and so

37:46.673 --> 37:52.078
a large rural area, some students are going to have to continue to be bused to a Huron school.

37:52.898 --> 38:07.671
And another clarification, when you're talking about the outstanding bond indebtedness, so there is currently, we're not talking about the new bond that they have not drawn from the line of credit, we're talking about existing bonds?

38:07.911 --> 38:09.132
Well, we're talking about both.

38:09.673 --> 38:14.297
You know, the Kohling-Huron district just passed a new

38:15.287 --> 38:18.728
voters in the district just passed a new general obligation bond in November.

38:19.468 --> 38:41.956
So the liability for outstanding bonded indebtedness refers to both the existing bond debt on the earlier bond issue, but also any bond debt that's incurred by the Koalinga-Huron Unified School District from this point on to when a Huron Unified District would be formed.

38:44.127 --> 38:48.470
So we don't know what that might be, but... I remember Ortiz-Lacombe.

38:51.693 --> 39:01.281
You know, I'm a little divided with this because I've seen this happen in other communities where you could be integrated but not integrated.

39:01.621 --> 39:06.685
And when you're made to feel like a second class citizen in your own school, in your own community.

39:07.145 --> 39:15.336
And even within the Latino community, we are very diverse, you know, it's by generation, it's by languages, by socioeconomic status.

39:15.896 --> 39:23.807
So I understand why there's a push for this, because people want to have a sense of belonging and

39:24.387 --> 39:27.472
and some sense of local control and dignity in their school sites.

39:27.912 --> 39:35.463
But I've also seen how difficult it is once you really get to the logistics and the legal aspect of dividing a district.

39:35.603 --> 39:39.549
And one of the things that has come up in the past, which I didn't see reflected here and I'm wondering,

39:40.450 --> 39:41.991
is teachers.

39:42.491 --> 39:54.859
So when you have a unified district and now you have to become two, there is an issue of where the teacher has tenure and who then has the pension liability of a teacher.

39:54.899 --> 39:56.921
And it gets really costly for some districts.

39:57.281 --> 40:03.545
So I know that that has stopped other districts from pursuing that option of breaking down a district.

40:04.005 --> 40:12.511
Has that been considered here beyond the facilities, which I know that that sounds like very cost prohibited, but there's also the cost of teachers and where they will transfer to.

40:14.112 --> 40:17.654
That's a big one in previous conversations with other districts.

40:18.195 --> 40:18.395
Right.

40:18.435 --> 40:19.015
And you're correct.

40:19.055 --> 40:26.861
It is an issue, but we didn't address it here because everything affecting not just teachers, but classified staff is governed by education code.

40:27.601 --> 40:31.504
In this case, the teachers in the Huron community

40:32.642 --> 40:34.683
It would just be the elementary and middle school teachers.

40:35.124 --> 40:46.452
They would have a choice to either stay with the Coalinga-Huron district or move to stay with their same schools in a new Huron district.

40:46.872 --> 40:56.239
A lot of that decision is going to be based on what the teacher is believed to be the viability of the new district and what their salary schedule is going to be because they're not guaranteed the same salary schedule.

40:57.819 --> 41:11.424
And so if that's the case, and this is maybe the issue you're dealing with, you'll see a large number of teachers in the Huron schools wanting to remain in the Koalinga Huron School District.

41:11.804 --> 41:18.466
And what then happens is that there will be overstaffing at the remaining portion of Koalinga.

41:18.991 --> 41:24.793
And, you know, the younger, less experienced teachers would be pushed out.

41:25.413 --> 41:31.256
And it was likely that those teachers would be the ones or it could be likely that those teachers would be the one moving to the Huron schools.

41:32.716 --> 41:34.417
So, yeah, there's no guarantee of salary.

41:34.497 --> 41:45.981
It's going to be up to the governing board of the new district and whatever and whatever bargaining unit for the teachers in the new district happens to spring up to determine what the new salary schedule will be.

41:46.417 --> 42:02.140
And I think those are some unintended consequences that people don't always consider because you could have your own sense of identity, have more local control, feel more represented, but you may be financially insolvent and have these issues that have not been previously considered.

42:02.200 --> 42:03.300
And that's a great concern.

42:03.640 --> 42:15.122
And one other teacher issue is that, you know, I believe that the Teachers Union of Coalinga, as well as the Classified Staff Bargaining Unit, don't support this reorganization.

42:17.762 --> 42:20.323
Any other questions before we begin the public hearing?

42:22.764 --> 42:23.404
Superintendent.

42:24.024 --> 42:34.827
The election that occurred, what was the percentage passage and the amount and how did it break between the Huron portion and the Coalinga portion in terms of the voters support for the measure?

42:35.307 --> 42:35.747
The bond?

42:36.268 --> 42:36.448
Yes.

42:36.848 --> 42:38.428
I don't have that with me right now.

42:40.829 --> 42:46.671
I know that the Huron petitioners would state that the Huron community did not support the bond.

42:48.064 --> 42:49.926
But I don't have those numbers in front of me.

42:52.588 --> 42:53.368
Right.

42:53.549 --> 42:53.869
OK.

42:53.909 --> 42:55.110
Now we have a public hearing.

42:55.290 --> 42:58.613
Each side has 10 minutes to present.

42:59.313 --> 43:01.335
And I declare the public hearing open.

43:02.075 --> 43:09.221
And so I will take first the Huron petitioners who support their new district.

43:09.501 --> 43:13.745
And they have 10 minutes and then the opponents will have 10 minutes.

43:23.320 --> 43:23.580
Pardon?

43:23.900 --> 43:26.221
These are the people that want to form the new district.

43:36.183 --> 43:37.223
No, the reverse.

43:37.263 --> 43:40.824
The people that want to petition approved should go first.

43:56.974 --> 43:58.175
Good morning, members of the board.

43:59.256 --> 44:01.217
My name is Bonifacio Bonnie Garcia.

44:01.917 --> 44:06.080
I am counsel for the petitioners with the law firm of Garcia Hernandez Sani.

44:07.161 --> 44:12.265
We are a law firm with offices in San Diego, Glendale, and the Bay Area.

44:12.705 --> 44:16.247
We have extensive experience representing school districts for the last 20 years.

44:18.109 --> 44:20.750
A point of personal privilege is that I grew up in Huron.

44:24.085 --> 44:27.508
I then went on to Loyola Marymount, and I'm a graduate of the Harvard Law School.

44:29.109 --> 44:40.517
The problem is that when I was in sixth grade, my parents decided that there were no opportunities for us, given that we would have to go to Coalinga High School.

44:41.297 --> 44:41.878
And we moved.

44:42.898 --> 44:55.228
My father ran the theater, ran the gas station, had a hay business, was an established member of the community, uprooted the family and got out of Dodge to go become a parole in the San Fernando Valley.

44:55.268 --> 44:59.611
And our life became a lot tougher because of the lack of an educational opportunity.

45:00.191 --> 45:01.192
And nothing has changed.

45:02.333 --> 45:20.531
The compelling reason for the reorganization of this district is the fact that not only is Coalinga High School a unified school district, Coalinga-Huron Unified School District, low performing, Coalinga High School is rated in the bottom 5% of school districts, of high school districts.

45:21.712 --> 45:26.537
For decades, the district has made decisions to the detriment and the benefit

45:27.199 --> 45:29.260
the detriment of Huron and the benefit of the Kalinga.

45:30.080 --> 45:33.061
I just heard that there was excess capacity.

45:33.761 --> 45:36.822
There would be even more excess capacity if this had gone through.

45:37.382 --> 45:45.185
It isn't like all of a sudden the number of Huron kids just dropped on Kalinga and they had to build up.

45:45.365 --> 45:54.088
This thing has been developing for a long time and it's a little awkward to say we made all the wrong choices and therefore we should be protected.

45:55.185 --> 45:59.470
by building from our decisions to build in Coalinga and not build in Huron.

45:59.790 --> 46:03.274
And that's why we can't separate.

46:04.535 --> 46:08.159
But to get into more particulars with respect to the recommendations.

46:11.002 --> 46:14.066
The county's recommendation and staff's recommendations.

46:15.054 --> 46:29.299
are based on number one, not completing, not considering the entire law with respect to the DSEG issues and actually having some factual errors with respect to the bond and the facilities issues.

46:30.019 --> 46:32.540
Very quickly, let's talk about the DSEG issues.

46:33.960 --> 46:38.942
I believe, you know, a surface review of the numbers shows, yeah, that's right.

46:40.429 --> 46:46.795
There are almost no, in fact I think there's one white student in Huron and all the white students are in Kalinga.

46:47.535 --> 46:51.419
But the other factors that the law states is that you look at some other things.

46:51.679 --> 46:54.661
One is isolation, the distance.

46:55.302 --> 47:04.529
Now people say it's 20 miles on a school bus that has to make stops at other areas in the rural areas that are rather than three miles.

47:05.430 --> 47:11.374
of Huron that turned that bus ride from a minimum of 45 minutes to 90 minutes.

47:12.675 --> 47:24.163
So students are on the bus a long time, a minimum of an hour and a half to three hours every day just to go to high school.

47:25.424 --> 47:29.207
And you know they have the saying about this, when you put a kid on the bus they don't necessarily get off.

47:30.148 --> 47:33.650
And that means you have a large number of kids, and this is true in LA.

47:34.090 --> 47:35.351
I used to represent LA Unified.

47:36.052 --> 47:42.356
A large number of kids when you're in busing, just the hazards of busing result in lower attendance over time.

47:43.316 --> 47:44.197
That by itself.

47:44.957 --> 47:49.680
And Huron has suffered from that in a massive way.

47:50.761 --> 47:57.005
Moreover, the bus schedules limit students' opportunities to participate fully in the life of the district.

47:58.005 --> 47:59.166
No question about it.

47:59.935 --> 48:09.537
When you add to that the fact that Huron has 25% of its population that doesn't have a car, they couldn't even get their kids there if they wanted to get them there themselves.

48:10.318 --> 48:21.701
I haven't even started to deal with the issue of having members of the community in Huron being able to go address grievances and deal with their rights to participate in the process in Kalinga.

48:22.101 --> 48:23.201
They even can't even get there.

48:24.833 --> 48:26.514
So isolation, next.

48:26.895 --> 48:28.536
Demographics are changing.

48:29.136 --> 48:31.198
And that is, you wanted to know what the numbers were.

48:31.318 --> 48:39.124
Within a few years, it's going to be a difference of, Huron will have something like 98.9% Latino, and Coalinga will be 91%.

48:39.364 --> 48:42.146
So let me get this straight.

48:43.947 --> 48:53.594
For the privilege, for the beneficial effects of having to rub elbows, or being able to rub elbows with the white community,

48:54.733 --> 48:57.835
their educational rights are still continuing to be devastated.

48:58.735 --> 49:02.657
Because the numbers, the outcomes are clear and undisputed.

49:02.677 --> 49:06.660
I did not hear anybody saying that anybody from here was getting a good education.

49:07.020 --> 49:09.601
I didn't even hear them say that they were getting a good education in Kalinga.

49:10.422 --> 49:14.284
What I did hear, let me slow down.

49:14.304 --> 49:15.665
So,

49:19.518 --> 49:25.004
What is clear is that I believe, and I think the record demonstrates, they're not getting a free appropriate public education.

49:26.209 --> 49:34.915
The numbers from the city council demonstrate, and again, I want to emphasize this, that when you look at the residents of Huron, the high school graduation rate is only 27%.

49:36.657 --> 49:46.464
You've been given numbers that say that 73%, what a great number, of Coalinga high school graduates are, you know, that Latinos graduated raised 73%.

49:46.504 --> 49:47.805
Wow, what about that other 27%?

49:47.905 --> 49:48.545
But that's an average.

49:53.291 --> 49:56.234
Huron makes 38%, 39%, maybe 40.

49:56.795 --> 50:01.139
Once you start factoring that average, Huron's numbers come in a lot lower.

50:01.159 --> 50:04.463
There's a lot of argument about like, well, what is the real rate?

50:05.302 --> 50:10.606
Well, it's not 27% high school graduates from Coalinga, because that's just the residential rate.

50:10.986 --> 50:12.127
It's not 73.

50:14.008 --> 50:20.052
A study done by Dr. Cyril Lozano in UCLA in 2011 found that that rate was about 50% graduation rate.

50:25.114 --> 50:31.019
The other thing to note is that all the continuation high schools or facilities are in Huron.

50:32.119 --> 50:36.603
The other thing with respect to DSAG is that everything goes one way.

50:38.544 --> 50:45.290
Coalinga isn't under a requirement to DSAG, but nobody goes sending white folk to Huron ever.

50:46.731 --> 50:53.136
You have a great deal of leeway on this inequity, but the bottom line is that you're not required to continue to sacrifice

50:54.437 --> 50:57.603
Latino educational opportunities in the name of diversity.

50:58.364 --> 51:01.249
Next, with respect to the bond, very quickly, I know my time is flying.

51:02.331 --> 51:02.952
There's an error.

51:04.625 --> 51:14.491
Lozano-Smith was counsel for the petitioners and did an analysis and presented the position of Kalinga on what that split was.

51:14.711 --> 51:17.313
This is the first time we have heard the 59% number.

51:18.353 --> 51:27.759
Lozano-Smith's number, and you see it in an attachment to our brief that we submitted on Friday, is 43% of the assessed value would go to Huron, not 59.

51:29.620 --> 51:32.421
And we don't know where that 59% number came from.

51:32.882 --> 51:36.383
And we can't find it in any of the materials other than the 43% number.

51:37.384 --> 51:44.187
Kalinga's own number is that out of the $2 billion plus in assessed value, $949 million would be Huron.

51:44.748 --> 51:45.148
That's not 59%.

51:45.348 --> 51:53.312
And that's the original sin on which this staff's analysis is based in terms of the ability to bond.

51:53.992 --> 51:57.214
How much of the indebtedness that we would be responsible for in Huron.

51:58.995 --> 52:01.896
43, not 59.

52:02.556 --> 52:05.857
And it's an error.

52:07.298 --> 52:16.182
It's an error, okay, that Kalinga, and it's a number of 43% is a number that Kalinga has admitted in their own papers.

52:17.302 --> 52:19.143
So don't know about that.

52:19.843 --> 52:22.544
Next, with respect to the cost of a $35 million high school.

52:25.370 --> 52:34.213
You know, we've looked and again, we've presented comparisons at other high schools of similar situated rural areas to provide program, not 35 million, it's 22.

52:35.494 --> 52:38.535
All that's, you know, he said, she said, or whatever.

52:38.755 --> 52:44.477
But starting with the bottom line number is not 59%, it's 43.

52:45.518 --> 52:48.679
And then again, we can start getting into bloody details in the weeds.

52:48.799 --> 52:51.480
But again, that's the bottom line number.

52:51.580 --> 52:53.721
And of course, you have discretion,

52:54.915 --> 53:02.643
And if we're talking a little bit about the margins, you guys also have the ability to craft an equitable solution.

53:02.983 --> 53:12.252
Because the other point that's been clear is that over the decades, Coalinga has taxed Huron for the benefit of Coalinga facilities.

53:13.533 --> 53:17.437
The last bond, $11 million, $2 million ended up in Huron, $9 million ended up in Coalinga.

53:20.791 --> 53:31.137
Next, with respect to the finances, the state's analysis, we don't disagree with how they got there, but they used a number of 1520 kids.

53:32.377 --> 53:33.878
We don't know where that number came from.

53:35.019 --> 53:37.880
Kalinga itself indicated that it was 1620.

53:37.980 --> 53:41.502
The census says it's 1861.

53:43.837 --> 53:51.344
Kalinga commissioned a study by a demographer in 2013, and that number was 1,751.

53:51.504 --> 53:58.471
So that's an outside number, even from Kalinga's own folk.

53:58.491 --> 54:01.093
1,751 is more than 200 more ADA.

54:02.014 --> 54:07.639
That alone would make it financially sustainable for the long term.

54:09.040 --> 54:09.621
Thank you very much.

54:11.069 --> 54:18.755
Okay, now the people that support the CDE recommendation can come forward.

54:30.864 --> 54:34.848
Good morning State Board, State Superintendent of Instructions.

54:35.468 --> 54:36.649
Thank you for having me here today.

54:37.352 --> 54:41.073
My name is Roger Campbell and I'm a board member for the Colinga-Huron Unified School District.

54:41.734 --> 54:46.075
I'm also a 60 year part of Colinga-Huron Unified School District.

54:46.355 --> 54:54.658
I started in 1956 as a first grade student and I've either been a student or an employee of the district for the length of that time.

54:55.819 --> 55:02.701
I'm here joined today by Lisa Culberson, our board president, Margo Perkins and Maggie Hong, who are principal and vice principals at Colinga High School.

55:03.282 --> 55:06.403
And our attorneys, Roberta Rowe and Ryan Tung.

55:07.824 --> 55:19.414
For the last 60 years, the district has served the students of Klinger-Huron community, providing the students a quality education while creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere for all students of the community.

55:20.335 --> 55:26.440
The district agrees with the findings of CDE and the Fresno County Committee on the petition should not be approved.

55:27.300 --> 55:35.928
I am here today to respectfully highlight some additional information that the board may wish to consider about why the petitions have failed substantially

55:37.219 --> 55:41.525
to meet the number of statutory conditions for the petition to be approved.

55:42.086 --> 55:48.174
Before I begin, please also be aware that we received the petitioner's lengthy written comments on Monday.

55:49.195 --> 55:51.418
Petitioners did not serve the district courtesy copy.

55:51.478 --> 55:54.222
We were only notified by CDE that we have them.

55:56.263 --> 56:09.993
With the time limit in mind today, I will focus on three conditions the CDE and County Committee both concluded were not met, as well as an additional condition that the County Committee concluded was not met.

56:11.098 --> 56:27.121
First, the district agrees with the committee, the county committee, and the CDE that the petition has failed to meet criteria number four because the reorganization will not preserve each affected district's ability to educate students in an integrated environment and will promote racial and ethnic segregation.

56:27.888 --> 56:32.832
A major catalyst of the reorganization petition is the establishment of a new high school in Huron.

56:33.232 --> 56:46.081
Based on the 15-16 CALPADS information, the reorganization would promote racial segregation because it would result in a significant increase in the percentage of Hispanic students that would attend the proposed new high school.

56:47.276 --> 56:56.042
As an example, if the segregation reorganization is passed, the estimated student population of the new high school in Huron would be 97% Hispanic, 0.2% White, 2.5% Asian, and 2.2% African-American.

56:56.062 --> 57:01.885
As compared to the current composition of Kalinga High School, which is 85% Hispanic, 11.4% White, 1.6% Asian, and 0.9% African-American.

57:01.905 --> 57:03.046
The 12% increase in

57:16.114 --> 57:26.645
Hispanic population would result in a new high school in Huron with 423 Hispanic students, one white student, one African-American, and 11 Asian students.

57:27.466 --> 57:31.410
A prime example of the reorganization would result in racial and ethnic segregation.

57:32.324 --> 57:39.929
This clear racial and ethnic segregation would have the effect of preventing an integrated educational experience for the students who would attend the new high school in Huron.

57:40.670 --> 57:49.036
Petitioner argues that a new high school would closely resemble the demographics of the city of Huron, and therefore the board should completely ignore the specific criteria.

57:49.756 --> 57:50.536
we disagree.

57:50.917 --> 58:05.942
The legislature was very clear in creating the criteria that reorganization should occur should not occur when one effect with with the student attending school is a more radically racially segregated environment, which is the precise case here today.

58:06.563 --> 58:08.583
Next, I would like to turn to seventh criteria.

58:08.864 --> 58:11.585
The district agrees with the Fresno County Committee and the CDAE

58:12.865 --> 58:20.127
that this criteria is not met because of the reorganization will result in a significant and undeniable increase in student facilities.

58:21.247 --> 58:32.329
Education Code Section 35780 allows newly organized district five years from the date of the reorganization becomes effective to provide the necessary school facilities.

58:32.389 --> 58:39.751
However, there is no indication that Huron Unified School District will be able to complete the reconstruction of a new high school within those five years.

58:40.518 --> 58:44.462
School construction is a very complicated process involving multiple state agencies.

58:45.103 --> 58:55.493
For example, just site acquisition requires numerous studies and approval from CDE, the Department of Toxic Substances, and control in the City Planning Commission, among others.

58:56.393 --> 58:56.854
Excuse me.

58:58.188 --> 59:06.494
More importantly, it is unclear how the proposed Huron Unified School District will attain the necessary funding to building a high school within the five-year time frame.

59:06.974 --> 59:11.338
The CTE estimates the construction of the high school will cost at least $35 million.

59:12.078 --> 59:19.083
Please note that the petitioner's estimated cost of $22 million is both inaccurate and misleading.

59:19.483 --> 59:23.887
Petitioners point to the construction of Harmony Magnet School as proof of their $22 million facility.

59:27.352 --> 59:28.433
a $22 million estimate.

59:28.533 --> 59:37.515
However, Harmony Magnet School is not a standalone facility, but rather share a significant amount of crucial facilities with the existing Strathmore High School.

59:38.296 --> 59:44.878
The proposed year on high school would therefore cost significantly more than the $22 million proposed by the petitioners.

59:45.098 --> 59:47.178
The CDE's estimate of $35 million is more accurate.

59:48.979 --> 59:51.280
Petitioner stated that state funding would be available.

59:51.700 --> 59:57.684
First and foremost, there is no guarantee that petitioner will be deemed eligible for state funding.

59:58.284 --> 01:00:10.090
Even if the petitioner was deemed eligible for state funding, the most petition the petitioner would be eligible for is the estimated six million dollars for construction of new high school.

01:00:11.616 --> 01:00:14.818
That's leaving the petition responsible raising nearly 30 million dollars.

01:00:15.838 --> 01:00:19.360
Petitioners suggested they could pass a local bond measure.

01:00:20.581 --> 01:00:27.905
However, the feasibility of a new locally approved bond is uncertain, especially considering the fact that such a bond has not yet been placed on a ballot.

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:34.489
And uncertainty, the uncertainty of passage and the tight five-year statutory frame is created by the new high school.

01:00:35.149 --> 01:00:38.591
Assuming the sake, for the sake of argument, the petitioners were able to pass a bond,

01:00:39.031 --> 01:00:42.196
they would be significantly short of money required to build such a high school.

01:00:42.657 --> 01:00:50.047
The maximum amount they would be able to raise through bonds is $18 million according to CDE estimations, far short of the $35 million needed.

01:00:51.781 --> 01:00:55.024
All the process of a new high school is long and costly.

01:00:55.444 --> 01:01:09.716
Therefore, it is abundantly clear that the petition will result in a significant and undeniable increase in school facility costs with no indication that the petitioners will be able to complete and pay for such construction within the requisite five-year time period.

01:01:10.336 --> 01:01:16.682
The reorganization will also have a real and a possible negative impact on the facilities remaining at Kalinga High School.

01:01:17.522 --> 01:01:19.484
Next, I would like to turn to ninth criteria.

01:01:21.229 --> 01:01:24.131
The district, again, agrees with the Fresno County Committee and the CDE.

01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:34.799
The criteria is not met because the reorganization will fail to promote the fiscal management and will be a substantial negative effect on the fiscal status of the district.

01:01:35.199 --> 01:01:39.302
I wanted to emphasize the financial projections highlighted in the CDE report.

01:01:39.802 --> 01:01:55.296
To remind you, Mr. Juan Morales, Director of the School Facilities and Transportation Services Division, reviewed the finances of the district along with the calculations of LCFF revenue to see how the financials would look at the proposed Huron and proposed Colingus districts.

01:01:55.957 --> 01:02:00.401
They had two districts been in existence during the 15-16 and the 16-17 school year.

01:02:01.042 --> 01:02:02.783
The results showed that the 16-17, both the proposed

01:02:04.685 --> 01:02:08.649
Huron District and Proposed Clinger District would suffer from deficit spending.

01:02:09.130 --> 01:02:15.737
The Proposed Huron District would have deficit spending of $2 million while the Proposed Clinger District would have a deficit spending of $1.3 million.

01:02:17.699 --> 01:02:29.663
We note that $2 million in deficit spending for Huron does not take into account the cost of duplication of administrative services that are necessary for the creation of a new school district or the cost of funding a $35 million high school.

01:02:30.184 --> 01:02:39.167
The district's current administrative positions alone, defined for ease of reference as directors, assistants, superintendents, and superintendents, cost our district about $1.4 million for 15-16 and benefits.

01:02:43.154 --> 01:03:01.227
The project deficit spending along with the cost of duplication administrative costs and the necessary costs in Newton High School are clear evidence that the proposed reorganization will fail to promote sound fiscal management and will have a substantial negative impact effect on the final fiscal status of a district.

01:03:01.687 --> 01:03:03.628
Finally, I would like to turn to the sixth criteria.

01:03:03.648 --> 01:03:09.032
The district agrees with Fresno County Committee that the petitioners have failed to meet the criteria six because

01:03:11.553 --> 01:03:15.736
performance was significantly disrupted educational programs of the district.

01:03:16.136 --> 01:03:21.020
If the reorganization petition is granted and approved, the new high school would be established in Huron.

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:24.543
The current high school would lose a significant amount of its enrollment.

01:03:25.183 --> 01:03:32.769
A split and a subsequent decrease in enrollment would result in a significant decrease in a variety of AP and specialized classes.

01:03:34.073 --> 01:03:44.340
Currently, Kalinga High School is able to offer eight AP classes and approximately 25 specialized or career technical education classes that include computer programming, welding, and AP calculus.

01:03:46.821 --> 01:03:53.405
As a practical matter, the projected enrollment of the Kalinga High School in Huron would be approximately 436 students or 37% of the school's current population.

01:03:56.775 --> 01:04:00.136
Most of the teachers at the current high school would have single subject credential.

01:04:00.476 --> 01:04:09.619
This significant decrease in student population would act to prohibit the new high school in Huron from hiring the same number of certificated staff or a greater population filling the high school permits.

01:04:10.399 --> 01:04:18.722
Therefore, the reduction in certificated staff would necessitate in reduction of type of classes offered to post high school in Huron.

01:04:22.554 --> 01:04:28.738
Those who remain at Clinga High School also suffer as a result of proposed due to the decreased enrollment and therefore decreased class offerings.

01:04:28.818 --> 01:04:34.522
The district estimates that the staff would need to be reduced by 22 certificated staff members and seven classified.

01:04:34.622 --> 01:04:36.484
Is that time?

01:04:36.764 --> 01:04:37.424
Yeah, that's time.

01:04:37.464 --> 01:04:37.845
Thank you.

01:04:38.105 --> 01:04:38.465
Thank you.

01:04:39.366 --> 01:04:40.687
I'd be happy to answer any questions.

01:04:40.767 --> 01:04:46.711
We can call them back if we need to, but I need to close the public hearing and

01:04:47.369 --> 01:04:49.291
Do we want to go directly to public comment?

01:04:50.132 --> 01:04:52.514
Usually we do that and then have questions.

01:04:52.675 --> 01:04:53.836
Okay, call the roll.

01:04:55.638 --> 01:04:57.440
Would the following people please line up?

01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:10.133
Delora Silva, Ben Silva, Paul McLean Legowski, Ray Leon, Bonnie Garcia, William D. Ross, Veronica Aguirre, William Saladin,

01:05:12.865 --> 01:05:28.435
Virginia Carneiro, Jenny Robledo, Maria Avena, Frank Avena, Marie Mejia, Jack Castro, Liz Guillen, Roberto Pimentel, Jorge Solario.

01:05:29.816 --> 01:05:30.957
You can speak in just one moment.

01:05:30.997 --> 01:05:31.978
Let me finish the list, please.

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:37.461
Bernardo Reyes and Rogelio Ramirez.

01:05:37.922 --> 01:05:38.242
Thank you.

01:05:44.872 --> 01:05:46.434
My name is Laura Silva.

01:05:50.997 --> 01:05:52.118
Oh, right here?

01:05:54.159 --> 01:05:54.700
I'm sorry.

01:06:00.824 --> 01:06:02.665
My name is Laura Silva.

01:06:04.086 --> 01:06:05.567
I am the chief petitioner.

01:06:06.596 --> 01:06:10.058
I was a teacher for 31 years and retired.

01:06:11.398 --> 01:06:16.161
I also served as a trustee of Kalinga-Huron Unified School District.

01:06:17.281 --> 01:06:25.085
I attest to the unequal treatment in education between schools in Kalinga and Huron.

01:06:28.006 --> 01:06:34.069
I ask that the State Board of Education approve the petition and send it to the voters of Huron.

01:06:35.922 --> 01:06:37.683
Think about your own children.

01:06:38.985 --> 01:06:42.688
You want the best for yours just like the people of Huron do.

01:06:44.709 --> 01:06:48.653
Our students deserve to get an education and they're not being educated.

01:06:51.355 --> 01:06:53.116
And we need your help.

01:06:54.918 --> 01:07:04.746
Instead of having all these children, our students that drop out of school and end up, you know, doing hard labor,

01:07:06.111 --> 01:07:08.572
or committing crimes or selling drugs.

01:07:09.192 --> 01:07:10.433
We want to change this.

01:07:11.493 --> 01:07:17.395
I have lived in Huron since 1948, and I have seen a lot of suffering.

01:07:17.755 --> 01:07:25.478
And I'm telling you, the parents work very hard because they want their children just like you want the best for your children.

01:07:28.039 --> 01:07:32.901
They want for them to get an education and not be on the heat, especially right now in the summertime.

01:07:32.921 --> 01:07:33.281
Time is up.

01:07:33.481 --> 01:07:33.801
Thank you.

01:07:35.131 --> 01:07:38.393
suffering, you know, so much and not earning very much money.

01:07:38.413 --> 01:07:43.717
And they want their children to be educated.

01:07:44.218 --> 01:07:49.141
They go through a lot of hardship, the children and the families too.

01:07:49.582 --> 01:07:50.082
Thank you.

01:07:54.185 --> 01:07:56.186
It's one minute for the public commenters.

01:07:58.648 --> 01:08:03.431
First of all, Benjamin Silva and

01:08:05.071 --> 01:08:06.692
We've been working on this since 2005.

01:08:08.793 --> 01:08:14.496
And the county, the school districts, they always come up with different numbers.

01:08:15.757 --> 01:08:17.097
A demographer was hired.

01:08:17.658 --> 01:08:20.659
They gave a number of 1,751.

01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:26.823
Then from that point, they've tried to consistently lower that number because they want to make it

01:08:27.768 --> 01:08:28.949
not financially viable.

01:08:29.469 --> 01:08:32.372
In terms of bonding, we gave them two scenarios.

01:08:32.832 --> 01:08:35.774
First scenario was the Harmony Magnet.

01:08:36.195 --> 01:08:39.838
The second scenario was Vasquez High School of Act and Unified.

01:08:40.818 --> 01:08:44.642
And both came in within $22 to $23 million.

01:08:45.542 --> 01:08:49.025
So we don't know where they're getting their info from.

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.126
So we know we're viable.

01:08:50.486 --> 01:08:54.529
In terms of segregation, they're traveling

01:08:55.891 --> 01:08:59.174
I mean, 40 miles in one direction.

01:08:59.935 --> 01:09:00.996
That's isolation.

01:09:02.237 --> 01:09:06.481
That's a part of the law, distance between educational facilities.

01:09:06.501 --> 01:09:06.862
Thank you.

01:09:12.977 --> 01:09:15.982
Members of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Torlakson.

01:09:16.402 --> 01:09:17.363
Thanks for the opportunity.

01:09:17.403 --> 01:09:18.625
Paul McLean-Legowski.

01:09:19.206 --> 01:09:24.793
I'm Chief Innovation Officer for Fresno County Economic Opportunities Commission and you may wonder what are we doing here?

01:09:25.574 --> 01:09:30.061
We're an anti-poverty organization and have successfully worked and empowered

01:09:30.721 --> 01:09:35.643
The residents in Fresno County that most need that have been doing that for 52 years now.

01:09:36.263 --> 01:09:41.945
Huron is part of the county and we have invested greatly in Huron for obvious reasons.

01:09:42.025 --> 01:09:46.947
The poverty rate, unemployment rate, unacceptably high in the 40 to 50 percent range.

01:09:47.547 --> 01:09:51.309
We have Head Start programs there, employment programs, LIHEAP.

01:09:52.529 --> 01:09:54.890
food distributions that take place regularly.

01:09:55.590 --> 01:10:02.252
And today, we paid for a couple of vans to bring the residents of Huron here to this hearing.

01:10:02.272 --> 01:10:04.053
Now, why would we do something like that?

01:10:05.533 --> 01:10:09.954
Simply because this is important to us, important to that community.

01:10:10.535 --> 01:10:14.256
And I want to underscore, we're not talking about numbers here exclusively.

01:10:14.276 --> 01:10:16.156
We're not talking about dollars.

01:10:16.276 --> 01:10:17.697
We're talking about students.

01:10:17.957 --> 01:10:19.197
We're talking about people.

01:10:19.877 --> 01:10:21.318
Thank you very much for your consideration.

01:10:26.829 --> 01:10:27.449
Buenos dias.

01:10:27.469 --> 01:10:27.869
Good morning.

01:10:27.909 --> 01:10:29.970
My name is Ray Leon, mayor, city of Huron.

01:10:30.230 --> 01:10:31.110
And I'll be really quick.

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:36.811
For the decades that we've been part of this district, you know, Huron is one of the poorest cities in the state of California.

01:10:37.211 --> 01:10:41.312
And we know that education is the greatest equalizer when it comes to economic advancement.

01:10:41.612 --> 01:10:47.873
We've been suffering under a district that's treated our children and our families not positively.

01:10:48.133 --> 01:10:50.194
Desperate treatment.

01:10:50.434 --> 01:10:52.254
You know, our monolingual Spanish-speaking families.

01:10:52.294 --> 01:10:54.134
And we have a very diverse community.

01:10:54.455 --> 01:10:56.215
We have over nine languages spoken in Huron.

01:10:56.735 --> 01:10:57.055
alone.

01:10:57.816 --> 01:10:58.837
Very diverse community.

01:10:59.678 --> 01:11:02.741
It is most evident in regards to the disparate treatment.

01:11:02.881 --> 01:11:12.149
It's most evident in the inequity and access to quality education, as the data depicts with the dropout rates, like the graduation rates, and also the A to the G completion.

01:11:12.930 --> 01:11:19.536
Coalinga High School is in one of the worst of the, one of the worst high schools in the county, which only further aggravates the

01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:21.858
the deficiencies.

01:11:22.959 --> 01:11:23.900
Let me share a scenario.

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:30.346
Mendota, it's a city, farm worker city in Fresno County as well, shares our story.

01:11:31.126 --> 01:11:32.648
They became their own district.

01:11:32.888 --> 01:11:34.589
We are as big as they were then.

01:11:35.130 --> 01:11:42.897
And now one of the, Ismael Herrera, you guys should have the letter of support as I conclude my comments, a letter of support from, he's a board member of Fresno County Office of Education.

01:11:43.417 --> 01:11:48.981
And he shares that this is important to them as well because it's the same scenario.

01:11:49.221 --> 01:11:53.203
And they've been able to grow economically and the students excel academically.

01:11:53.384 --> 01:11:54.024
Thank you very much.

01:11:54.184 --> 01:11:55.425
I hope you guys support us.

01:11:55.465 --> 01:11:55.765
Thank you.

01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:03.230
My name is Virginia V. Carnero.

01:12:03.991 --> 01:12:06.512
a retired teacher for Kalinga Huron Unified School District.

01:12:07.272 --> 01:12:09.273
At the present time, a substitute teacher for the area.

01:12:10.174 --> 01:12:17.177
I'm here to represent the former Oil King District, of which I still reside, being an alumnus of Oil King School.

01:12:19.178 --> 01:12:23.320
I can speak for the 131 students in the unincorporated area.

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:26.541
These students should be counted with the new Huron Unified District.

01:12:26.981 --> 01:12:29.522
When the school was closed, many students were transferred to Huron School.

01:12:30.263 --> 01:12:31.043
I would appreciate

01:12:32.102 --> 01:12:34.752
a yes vote from the State Board of Education to approve the petition.

01:12:35.294 --> 01:12:35.555
Thank you.

01:12:44.443 --> 01:12:45.824
My name is Veronica Aguirre.

01:12:46.064 --> 01:12:49.725
I'm a parent of two children that go to Huron Elementary.

01:12:50.226 --> 01:12:51.706
I also reside in Huron.

01:12:51.726 --> 01:13:01.651
I would like to ask for your support that you will consider our petition and allow the citizens of Huron to

01:13:02.631 --> 01:13:04.512
have their own school district.

01:13:04.572 --> 01:13:12.818
I don't believe that the as a citizen of Huron, we are not fairly represented within the district in regards to school board meetings and discussions.

01:13:13.278 --> 01:13:17.581
I mean, and things that they do, especially like fiscally.

01:13:18.622 --> 01:13:26.987
I did contact the school district one day or the school board or office to ask if they would consider having a meeting.

01:13:27.467 --> 01:13:34.272
I saw a letter at the post office that said they were going to have a open meeting in regards to the budget.

01:13:34.632 --> 01:13:47.220
I contacted the office to ask if they could possibly do it in Huron as well as Kalinga and they said that they do their meeting in Huron, I mean in Kalinga and in Huron they'll do decision making.

01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:51.203
I don't believe that that's very fair and I don't believe that we are supported.

01:13:51.403 --> 01:13:51.663
Thank you.

01:13:59.394 --> 01:14:00.355
Okay, my name is Jenny.

01:14:00.375 --> 01:14:03.677
I'm a Kalinga parent and I support Huron Unified School District.

01:14:04.838 --> 01:14:13.863
There has been racism, racial segregation and favoritism in Kalinga Huron Unified School since our family started going to school in 1992.

01:14:15.044 --> 01:14:19.107
There's something about feeling accepted that builds confidence in a student.

01:14:20.067 --> 01:14:25.071
It sounds to me that money is the real reason why Huron Unified School District is being opposed.

01:14:26.631 --> 01:14:29.393
The money is the root of all evil.

01:14:29.893 --> 01:14:46.281
And we have to understand that at the end of the day, everybody in this room, including community members, teachers, board members, and all of you guys, we are all here to ensure the success of every Californian student equally across the board.

01:14:46.762 --> 01:14:47.502
Thank you for your time.

01:14:55.054 --> 01:14:55.974
I'm Maria Avina.

01:14:56.034 --> 01:14:58.375
I'm here talking about taxation.

01:14:58.835 --> 01:15:01.076
We were talking about the bonds and stuff.

01:15:01.376 --> 01:15:04.497
It doesn't matter if Huron votes no on any of the bonds.

01:15:04.537 --> 01:15:06.918
We just passed two, two years ago, and this last one.

01:15:07.718 --> 01:15:11.740
Huron, even if we all vote no, they're going to pass the bonds.

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:12.740
It doesn't matter.

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:16.181
Coalinga, we're combined in the voting together.

01:15:16.782 --> 01:15:23.224
And so what they do is, of course, if it passes in Coalinga, it doesn't matter what Huron has to say or doesn't have to say.

01:15:23.684 --> 01:15:29.728
If you look at my property taxes, everything goes out of Huron and very little comes back in.

01:15:30.028 --> 01:15:33.711
We even pay for West Hills College, for Lemoore and Kalinga.

01:15:33.931 --> 01:15:36.793
We have no classes in Huron for West Hills.

01:15:37.113 --> 01:15:39.234
We have very, we have nothing.

01:15:39.695 --> 01:15:44.478
So if we vote, it doesn't matter if we vote no for a bond.

01:15:44.878 --> 01:15:49.222
that we know we're going to get very little money of, because it doesn't matter.

01:15:49.402 --> 01:15:50.483
We're still going to lose.

01:15:50.983 --> 01:15:54.726
We're going to lose because we're not in the same amount of people.

01:15:54.866 --> 01:15:56.588
And then we have five board members.

01:15:56.648 --> 01:15:58.049
We have two from... Time.

01:15:58.649 --> 01:16:00.971
Two from, you know, Huron and three from Kalinga.

01:16:01.011 --> 01:16:01.572
It doesn't matter.

01:16:07.165 --> 01:16:07.926
Good morning, board members.

01:16:07.946 --> 01:16:10.227
My name is Frank Cabrera, longtime Huron resident.

01:16:10.247 --> 01:16:11.628
I just want to read a little bit.

01:16:11.768 --> 01:16:13.650
The Colina trustees are recalling each other.

01:16:14.210 --> 01:16:15.651
The superintendent was just fired.

01:16:16.172 --> 01:16:18.854
The chief business officer was relieved of his duties.

01:16:19.494 --> 01:16:24.578
The district is scoring at the bottom of 5% of the state academically for over 20 years.

01:16:25.358 --> 01:16:26.880
The district is in total chaos.

01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:29.081
What would you want to keep it going?

01:16:29.301 --> 01:16:34.705
I ask that the Board of Education approve the petition and send it to the voters of Huron.

01:16:35.066 --> 01:16:35.366
Thank you.

01:16:41.451 --> 01:16:41.691
Good morning.

01:16:42.592 --> 01:16:45.713
Jack Castro, City of Huron.

01:16:46.854 --> 01:16:48.975
The status quo is not consistent.

01:16:49.255 --> 01:16:58.340
Therefore, we can't do this without our own separate Huron Unified School District making our own decision about our children's education.

01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:01.202
We don't want the status quo anymore.

01:17:01.622 --> 01:17:05.724
It is like old technology and it isn't working.

01:17:06.344 --> 01:17:07.285
It isn't good enough.

01:17:09.255 --> 01:17:18.839
Local ownership, innovative education, educational programs, increased graduation rates, attracting new businesses, expanding economic development.

01:17:22.432 --> 01:17:35.042
decreased levels of poverty and increased social benefit currently in situation where we are essentially abdicating to a partisan board which may also have a conflict of interest.

01:17:35.743 --> 01:17:39.746
The existing barriers to economic and social success are even stronger.

01:17:40.227 --> 01:17:42.449
Please don't strengthen the barriers.

01:17:42.629 --> 01:17:51.216
Instead, put ownership of this most important decision where it belongs in our community by approving our proposal for separate Huron-Uniford

01:17:51.816 --> 01:18:02.287
Unified School District help us give our children the best and most innovative education possible and all of the positive social and economic benefits that follows.

01:18:02.687 --> 01:18:02.988
Thank you.

01:18:11.687 --> 01:18:12.107
Good morning.

01:18:12.148 --> 01:18:13.369
My name is Roberto Pimentel.

01:18:13.789 --> 01:18:17.933
I teach at Huron Middle School, one of the feeder schools to the high school.

01:18:18.534 --> 01:18:23.039
I'm a lifelong resident of Huron, and I'm on the city council.

01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:25.661
I want to leave you with two words since I only have two minutes.

01:18:26.282 --> 01:18:27.724
Institutional oppression.

01:18:28.504 --> 01:18:30.046
That's what's going on at Calinga High School.

01:18:30.687 --> 01:18:32.468
They very rarely talk to our middle school.

01:18:33.149 --> 01:18:36.051
to collaborate for what's going on.

01:18:36.191 --> 01:18:41.495
They very rarely invite our students over there for a tour of the school that they're going to attend.

01:18:42.155 --> 01:18:46.238
So the main words I want to leave you with is institutional oppression.

01:18:46.999 --> 01:18:50.721
Everything that you see from their high school dropout rates, it's maneuvered.

01:18:51.462 --> 01:18:56.705
They communicate very, very little with the parents before they send the kids to continuation schools.

01:18:57.386 --> 01:18:58.226
When that happens,

01:18:59.227 --> 01:19:02.950
All of a sudden, they clean their hands and those kids didn't drop out from our school.

01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.651
Yes, they did.

01:19:04.111 --> 01:19:04.752
You sent them there.

01:19:05.693 --> 01:19:08.575
So just keep that in mind, please.

01:19:08.615 --> 01:19:11.297
And I am an employee of the district and I've seen it happen.

01:19:11.798 --> 01:19:14.980
Our school just got recognized this year as a national schools to watch.

01:19:15.921 --> 01:19:23.227
Nobody got sent from the district, not a superintendent, not the assistant superintendent, not a board member, because it was Huron Middle School that made it, not Calinga.

01:19:23.568 --> 01:19:23.848
Thank you.

01:19:30.689 --> 01:19:31.890
My name is Jorge Solorio.

01:19:32.710 --> 01:19:36.473
I'm a third grade teacher at Huron Elementary and a council member in Huron.

01:19:37.574 --> 01:19:48.241
We work really hard to motivate our Huron kids to dream high, to go for their goals, only to have them get to Coalinga and have those dreams squashed.

01:19:49.322 --> 01:19:50.663
That is really unfair to our kids.

01:19:51.483 --> 01:19:57.988
Recently, one of the Coalinga school board members referred to Huron as those people.

01:19:59.221 --> 01:20:02.706
how that just goes to highlight what Conninger really thinks about Huron.

01:20:03.267 --> 01:20:07.973
When they refer to us as those people, really sets the tone to what they really feel.

01:20:08.374 --> 01:20:13.761
So I think in order for us to get an equal and fair opportunity, we do need our own district.

01:20:13.982 --> 01:20:14.703
So thank you.

01:20:23.817 --> 01:20:24.237
Good morning.

01:20:24.617 --> 01:20:25.517
I'm Rogelio Ramirez.

01:20:25.958 --> 01:20:28.518
I'm a former alumni for Coalinga High School, class of 2015.

01:20:28.598 --> 01:20:32.619
I'm currently a civil engineer, or starting to be a civil engineer at UC Davis.

01:20:33.339 --> 01:20:37.020
I just want to hear and represent that I am a true example of what's going on.

01:20:38.241 --> 01:20:42.502
Going through the process of the four years, I was told by a counselor, are you sure you can make it to a UC?

01:20:43.582 --> 01:20:45.322
You should see how much that devastated me.

01:20:45.642 --> 01:20:48.583
Within the AP classes, of course, they say, we have all these AP classes.

01:20:49.103 --> 01:20:51.604
But the ratio of Huron to Coalinga students is 4 to 1.

01:20:53.353 --> 01:20:54.514
Come on, seriously?

01:20:54.534 --> 01:20:58.917
35 Calinga students and only four from Huron?

01:20:59.737 --> 01:21:00.478
What's that all about?

01:21:00.898 --> 01:21:01.919
It doesn't make any sense.

01:21:02.479 --> 01:21:11.745
Really, all my friends, everyone who I knew, they either dropped out of community college, didn't even go for a four-year, or even transferred out of community college.

01:21:12.145 --> 01:21:13.206
I'm just putting this out there.

01:21:13.626 --> 01:21:14.167
It's not fair.

01:21:14.487 --> 01:21:18.910
Institutional privilege is present within the district.

01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:20.451
Thank you, and enjoy the rest of your day.

01:21:25.475 --> 01:21:25.995
Good morning.

01:21:26.095 --> 01:21:27.837
I'm Liz Guillen with Public Advocates.

01:21:28.677 --> 01:21:48.290
I wanted to share that in 2006 and 2007, we supported an organized group of parents, mostly moms, but other community stakeholders, in asserting their rights under the Williams Settlement around facilities, and specifically water.

01:21:50.272 --> 01:21:59.877
They worked for over a year and it took uniform complaints and embarrassing through the media to get some changes.

01:21:59.997 --> 01:22:02.599
Bathrooms cleaned and bottled water.

01:22:03.039 --> 01:22:11.884
Fast forward to today, seeing this and hearing this, reading the papers, it doesn't seem like very much has changed.

01:22:12.785 --> 01:22:15.727
We think there are a lot of exceptional circumstances.

01:22:16.667 --> 01:22:27.934
not just in the criteria that you have to consider, but other educational provision or lack thereof.

01:22:28.975 --> 01:22:38.580
And we support the community and I urge you to take your decision seriously and consider all these circumstances.

01:22:39.101 --> 01:22:39.501
Thank you.

01:22:45.674 --> 01:22:46.554
Good morning, members.

01:22:46.594 --> 01:22:52.958
My name is Genesis Tang, and I'm here on behalf of Assemblymember Arambula, who represents the city of Huron.

01:22:53.738 --> 01:22:59.081
I would like to read a portion of the letter that was sent on behalf of the California Latino Legislative Caucus.

01:22:59.781 --> 01:23:11.027
Dear board members, on behalf of the California Latino Legislative Caucus, we ask that as you review the request to create the Huron Unified School District, that you consider the implications for the students who live in Huron.

01:23:11.827 --> 01:23:18.910
Students who live in Huron must spend a significant portion of their day on a bus commuting to and from high school in the city of Coalinga.

01:23:19.490 --> 01:23:32.875
According to a long-term study by the Harvard University, the single strongest factor in determining someone's economic life chances is not the local crime rate or their education, but how long it takes to get to school or work.

01:23:33.795 --> 01:23:39.460
Students' long daily commutes to Coalinga High School create undue challenges for students.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:48.948
The Coalinga-Huron Unified School District currently has a 43% dropout rate, and the time and distance the students commute must be a contributing factor.

01:23:49.528 --> 01:24:04.773
We appreciate the State Board of Education's dedication, efforts, and contributions to the academic development of our youth and ask that you consider the immediate and long-term positive impacts on the community of Huron as it pursues the feasibility of establishing the Huron Unified School District.

01:24:05.173 --> 01:24:05.833
Thank you for your time.

01:24:12.267 --> 01:24:13.028
Good morning, everyone.

01:24:13.068 --> 01:24:14.829
My name is Bernardo Reyes.

01:24:14.970 --> 01:24:20.735
I also went through the Kalinga-Huron Unified School District journey as a student.

01:24:21.275 --> 01:24:27.221
And I'm here to share a little bit as to why I feel that Huron needs its own district.

01:24:27.801 --> 01:24:36.089
Let's just look at the high school graduation rates and also the A through G completion rates, which is what our students' future is.

01:24:36.529 --> 01:24:37.650
If they're not completing A through G,

01:24:38.471 --> 01:24:40.032
their doors are pretty much closed.

01:24:40.332 --> 01:24:45.654
So please consider that when we're talking about creating a new district for our community.

01:24:46.174 --> 01:24:51.976
Also, I just also wanted to reflect upon the rebuttal that we heard this morning as to why

01:24:53.817 --> 01:25:01.940
Huron shouldn't have a school district and never did I hear a reason, a positive reason of why Huron students should keep going to Coalinga.

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:04.121
Not one did I hear that today.

01:25:04.581 --> 01:25:11.184
And clearly we can see that there is no representation of the Huron community at Coalinga-Huron Unified School District at this point.

01:25:11.964 --> 01:25:13.885
That's the reason why Huron needs its own district.

01:25:13.965 --> 01:25:14.285
Thank you.

01:25:19.568 --> 01:25:21.429
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the board.

01:25:21.469 --> 01:25:22.609
My name is Bill Ross.

01:25:22.629 --> 01:25:25.170
I'm an attorney with law offices in Palo Alto.

01:25:25.890 --> 01:25:27.410
I don't have a horse in this race.

01:25:28.030 --> 01:25:33.172
I know the petitioners through their interaction with the special district that I represent in Fresno.

01:25:33.612 --> 01:25:42.835
My area of practice predominantly is focused on LAFCO proceedings, the functional equivalent for what you're doing now for other units of local government.

01:25:43.355 --> 01:25:46.516
I think you should exercise your discretion and send it back.

01:25:47.156 --> 01:25:50.877
I think there are procedural due process problems with the county hearing.

01:25:51.377 --> 01:25:52.898
Among them, there's no record.

01:25:53.318 --> 01:25:55.758
You can't even access minutes on the website.

01:25:56.098 --> 01:25:59.219
There's no recounting of extra party communications.

01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:06.621
Many of the individuals on the committee appeared to be reading from script when they analyzed issues that came before it.

01:26:07.142 --> 01:26:11.943
I would respectfully suggest that there are two areas with the staff presented to you that are incorrect.

01:26:12.523 --> 01:26:19.106
The first is with respect to the bond proceeds being allocated, causing an increase in property taxes in Coalinga.

01:26:19.587 --> 01:26:24.509
Four decades of law under Article Proposition 13 would indicate that's incorrect.

01:26:24.929 --> 01:26:31.273
Also, there's no analysis of the issue for facilities of joint financing through joint power authority agreements.

01:26:31.733 --> 01:26:35.755
I suggest there is an example of that in American Canyon, California.

01:26:36.255 --> 01:26:40.956
where that took place between that city and the Napa Valley Unified School District.

01:26:41.476 --> 01:26:43.496
I implore you to exercise your discretion.

01:26:43.696 --> 01:26:44.076
Thank you.

01:26:48.197 --> 01:26:48.717
Good morning.

01:26:48.757 --> 01:26:50.138
My name is Alejandra Lopez.

01:26:50.318 --> 01:26:52.278
I grew up in Huron.

01:26:52.318 --> 01:26:57.499
I graduated from Calinga High School in 2012, and I just graduated from UC Berkeley this May.

01:26:57.519 --> 01:27:03.240
But we are very few because we need our high school.

01:27:04.409 --> 01:27:09.374
Not very, very few of us graduate from high school and very few of us make it to four years.

01:27:10.675 --> 01:27:18.562
In my eighth grade geometry class in Huron Middle School, we were 27 students that could have made it to AP Calculus my junior year.

01:27:19.363 --> 01:27:23.767
My junior year, I was the only one that made it to AP Calculus.

01:27:26.846 --> 01:27:28.207
The school did not support us.

01:27:28.347 --> 01:27:35.390
When I told my counselor that I got admitted to UC Berkeley, they told me I should consider community college instead.

01:27:36.510 --> 01:27:42.312
That's the discouragement our students are receiving, even the quote-unquote high-performing students.

01:27:43.033 --> 01:27:43.793
Thank you for your time.

01:27:49.164 --> 01:27:51.205
Okay, that concludes the public comment.

01:27:51.345 --> 01:27:53.626
And now we're ready for questions from board members.

01:27:53.686 --> 01:27:54.506
Ortiz-Lacombe.

01:27:55.266 --> 01:27:59.308
Bruce, yeah, maybe you want to start first again, if you want to.

01:28:02.349 --> 01:28:08.792
So I am the liaison for this district reorganization set of issues that come up from time to time.

01:28:08.812 --> 01:28:15.854
I do want to commend Larry and his staff for just a tremendously thorough job that you do on each of these.

01:28:15.874 --> 01:28:16.755
I'm always so impressed.

01:28:16.775 --> 01:28:17.235
This one is

01:28:18.384 --> 01:28:33.377
even more complicated, perhaps, than some of the other ones that we've looked at in recent years in that the issues surrounding each of the nine thresholds are significant and complex.

01:28:33.637 --> 01:28:44.086
And first of all, I just want to commend the staff and Larry in particular for making sure that they've looked under every stone as they go through this process.

01:28:45.006 --> 01:28:51.630
With that said, I'll let the rest of the board go ahead and ask questions and then be happy to come back in a minute.

01:28:52.771 --> 01:28:54.932
Okay, Ortiz-Lacon was first, yeah.

01:28:57.318 --> 01:29:09.728
Yeah, so one of the reasons that I stated earlier that I do think we need to have a financially solvent model for this is because I do believe that every student deserves a quality education.

01:29:10.048 --> 01:29:14.111
And that does require money, whether we want to admit, you know, to put the students first.

01:29:14.412 --> 01:29:17.874
We want to put the students first, but we want to align resources to provide that model.

01:29:18.755 --> 01:29:23.081
But in hearing some of the testimonies, you know, it saddens me.

01:29:23.121 --> 01:29:28.467
I feel like this meeting could be taking place in the 1960s, given the concerns that we're still hearing.

01:29:28.728 --> 01:29:31.271
The face of inequality is within our audience right now.

01:29:31.912 --> 01:29:34.795
And when people choose and want to resegregate,

01:29:35.376 --> 01:29:41.440
That tells you that this model of integration is only benefiting those with certain privileges and not all of the students.

01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:43.641
So that model is clearly not working.

01:29:43.761 --> 01:29:52.787
People are letting you know, this is the biggest signal that I've heard, that what you think is welcoming, what you think is integration, is obviously not, and it needs to be reconsidered.

01:29:53.447 --> 01:30:02.813
Regardless of what decision takes place today, I think that there is definitely a call of urgency to change practices that are making some students

01:30:03.413 --> 01:30:07.257
feel othered in the campus that's supposed to welcome them and educate them properly.

01:30:07.778 --> 01:30:09.800
And that is definitely a concern that I have.

01:30:11.161 --> 01:30:21.552
I also feel that the governance system is obviously not set up, not that we have anything to do with that, but clearly when you have a three to two vote, it's not properly set up to represent all.

01:30:22.092 --> 01:30:26.837
But I want to go back to the $43.59 discrepancy that was quoted and cited here.

01:30:27.177 --> 01:30:36.327
Can you tell us a little bit more about how that number has changed from 43%, which some feel that that was the appropriate number, to now 59% of the bond debt?

01:30:36.347 --> 01:30:36.727
Sure.

01:30:36.787 --> 01:30:36.907
The 43%

01:30:41.272 --> 01:30:42.513
Let me back up for a moment.

01:30:42.593 --> 01:30:55.749
The education code requires that when we do this, do our analysis, that we work the information that we use to analyze, it has to come to the county superintendent and the affected school district.

01:30:55.769 --> 01:30:58.152
So that's the source for all our information.

01:30:59.453 --> 01:31:05.918
The 43% came up in the very early consideration of the proposal at the local school district.

01:31:06.019 --> 01:31:11.843
They, I believe, Koalinga-Huron said that that was the case.

01:31:12.504 --> 01:31:17.888
At that time, you know, petitioners opposed that number, said it was incorrect.

01:31:19.269 --> 01:31:24.073
Later on in the process, Koalinga-Huron came back with a higher number.

01:31:24.113 --> 01:31:28.196
There was no percentage assigned to it, but, you know,

01:31:28.669 --> 01:31:43.413
comparing the number that, that the total assessed valuation that Kuala Lunga Huron put forward at the end of the local hearings and what we received to the county superintendent, that looks like it's about 59%.

01:31:43.793 --> 01:31:48.134
And again, the petitioners did not support that number.

01:31:49.155 --> 01:31:52.576
As you heard now, they want to go back to the original number they didn't support.

01:31:53.136 --> 01:31:56.457
So, that said,

01:31:59.372 --> 01:32:05.075
To me, you know, I've been doing this for 30 years dealing with reorganization issues.

01:32:05.936 --> 01:32:10.158
And this is really the first time and this is kind of a general comment.

01:32:10.698 --> 01:32:29.029
This is really the first time that I've experienced petitioners coming before the county committee or the state board trying to convince you that they have the funding capability to build a school and then asking you to consider that they should have less money to do that.

01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:42.951
because when you talk about 59% of the assessed valuation, that's something that a district pulling away, they would want to jack up that number because that's what's going to help them build that school.

01:32:43.972 --> 01:32:49.596
The assessed valuation and then the bonding capacity that comes from that, the two and a half percent of the assessed valuation.

01:32:50.217 --> 01:32:56.082
If you run the numbers, under 59, and this is just for an example, under 59%,

01:32:58.637 --> 01:33:03.118
Their bonding cap is, as we indicated, is about $31.5 million.

01:33:03.378 --> 01:33:12.621
And if we use that percentage also to account for their liability for existing bond and indebtedness, that's about $13.5 million.

01:33:12.881 --> 01:33:17.202
And you heard the figure of $18 million being available to build the high school.

01:33:17.742 --> 01:33:20.483
And that's the difference between 31.5 and 13.5.

01:33:20.563 --> 01:33:21.863
But if we use the 43%,

01:33:26.664 --> 01:33:29.566
then their bonding cap is $23 million.

01:33:30.566 --> 01:33:38.531
The percent of bonded indebtedness that they're obligated to drops about $4.5 million to about $9 million.

01:33:38.751 --> 01:33:42.374
$23 million minus $9 million is now $14 million.

01:33:42.914 --> 01:33:54.521
So if we go to that 43%, they actually have less money, $4 million less, available to finance school construction in the new district.

01:33:57.944 --> 01:34:07.472
If you move this forward, and if they want to go back to 43%, I mean, that's something, if they're formed, they could probably work that out with Coalinga.

01:34:07.512 --> 01:34:14.978
I'm sure Coalinga, the remaining Coalinga district would be very happy to reduce the amount of assessed valuation that they're losing.

01:34:15.419 --> 01:34:25.187
But, you know, it doesn't really, in terms of the numbers and the amount of money they have, the more assessed valuation you bring into the district,

01:34:25.779 --> 01:34:28.020
the more money you're going to have to build a high school.

01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:34.143
So I'm just, it's kind of confuses me why they're arguing that they should have less money.

01:34:34.763 --> 01:34:36.424
But I don't know if that answers your question.

01:34:36.884 --> 01:34:44.388
But the numbers come from the, come through the county office, county superintendent, primarily probably from the school district or the county assessor.

01:34:44.848 --> 01:34:47.469
We don't ask, we didn't have a source for the data.

01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:53.892
But, you know, my bigger confusion is why there,

01:34:54.707 --> 01:34:56.427
why they're arguing they should have less money.

01:34:58.128 --> 01:34:59.088
Board member Strauss.

01:35:00.648 --> 01:35:10.610
So I want to thank all the community that came forward to share their voices and to share and the graduates who shared their actual experiences in the school.

01:35:10.710 --> 01:35:22.593
And as a former school principal, you spoke to my heart about the guidance or lack of guidance and the issues that affected your potential following high school graduation.

01:35:22.633 --> 01:35:23.013
And I think

01:35:23.813 --> 01:35:29.957
I know I speak for many board members who we really want students to have opportunities through high school and beyond.

01:35:30.217 --> 01:35:38.722
And so the educational opportunities, I think, are important to offer both Coalinga and Huron students.

01:35:39.262 --> 01:35:41.964
So that being said, I feel like we're in a

01:35:42.624 --> 01:35:54.453
and a dilemma between understanding that the community of Huron wants to be respected, wants their own schools, wants to be proud, wants their students to give the best opportunity and yet we've got a financial dilemma.

01:35:54.513 --> 01:36:10.245
So I've watched this and I've worked in communities that have had that and so I understand and I wonder if there's a way and so I'm not sure elementary, middle, in order to limit the number of transitions between schools.

01:36:11.065 --> 01:36:20.073
Is that something that they could look at with the existing facilities to maybe create a K-8 or a K-6 and a 7-12?

01:36:20.633 --> 01:36:31.823
Is that something that would then require less facility money to build a brand new facility and then address this dilemma of not having enough money to actually build the high school?

01:36:32.043 --> 01:36:33.684
I just wonder if that's a possibility.

01:36:33.744 --> 01:36:34.745
Certainly, it's a possibility.

01:36:34.785 --> 01:36:37.948
There are many options that could be, you know, the problem we have here

01:36:38.628 --> 01:36:45.753
is that those, you know, what the Huron school district is going to do in regard to facilities will be determined by the governing board.

01:36:45.773 --> 01:36:48.575
And we don't have a governing board of that district at this point.

01:36:48.835 --> 01:36:50.737
There's just a lot of, you know, what we want.

01:36:50.757 --> 01:36:54.339
I mean, you know, the petitioners are saying they want a

01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:56.321
a high school.

01:36:56.881 --> 01:36:59.264
And that's what our analysis is based on, the high school.

01:36:59.344 --> 01:37:09.534
And a lot of our, especially the educational program condition, was that this high school would provide a similar program as an existing high school.

01:37:10.135 --> 01:37:11.456
But there are a lot of options out there.

01:37:11.977 --> 01:37:18.624
They would probably need some space, but if they would bring portables in or

01:37:19.424 --> 01:37:26.106
offer a smaller academy thing, academy style high school with fewer facilities that are going to cost more, cost less.

01:37:27.226 --> 01:37:35.869
But, you know, our analysis was based on providing an equivalent program, equivalent educational program, and our numbers reflect that.

01:37:37.049 --> 01:37:39.510
But there are a lot of options out there, yes, certainly.

01:37:41.107 --> 01:37:48.357
But there's nobody, there's nobody elected as the new governing board that's going to tell us what the new district would actually do.

01:37:48.697 --> 01:37:49.879
Well, and then go ahead.

01:37:50.059 --> 01:37:51.180
And that's my only follow up.

01:37:51.261 --> 01:37:55.626
I'm just in kind of looking up the district and finding background beyond what we were submitted.

01:37:56.227 --> 01:38:01.933
They currently, according to the newspaper, put their current superintendent on leave last month.

01:38:02.393 --> 01:38:03.934
So there's an interim superintendent.

01:38:03.954 --> 01:38:12.643
So I just wonder if we understand what's going on with governance or whether that impacts at all what's happening with this petition.

01:38:13.947 --> 01:38:16.409
I don't know if that, what the impacts are.

01:38:16.449 --> 01:38:23.415
A lot of their, you know, we have been dealing with this issue for a year and a half in terms of collecting the data and doing our analysis.

01:38:24.156 --> 01:38:26.678
And I understand there have been some changes in the district.

01:38:26.698 --> 01:38:32.443
You know, I wasn't aware of the superintendent issue, but I know they're looking for a new CBO at the district.

01:38:35.276 --> 01:38:42.080
So, I don't know if we have a representative from the County Office of Education here.

01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:44.041
They might be able to provide a little more insight.

01:38:50.445 --> 01:38:50.926
I can't help you.

01:38:50.986 --> 01:38:51.406
I'm sorry.

01:38:51.446 --> 01:38:52.247
I can't help you with that.

01:38:52.907 --> 01:38:53.247
Okay.

01:38:54.848 --> 01:38:56.689
I just wanted to clarify here for a minute.

01:39:13.757 --> 01:39:19.478
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.

01:39:19.518 --> 01:39:20.738
My name is Chris Lozano.

01:39:20.858 --> 01:39:23.519
I'm with the office of the... Excuse me.

01:39:23.639 --> 01:39:24.679
My name is Chris Lozano.

01:39:25.159 --> 01:39:33.181
I'm with the Fresno County Superintendent of Schools Office representing the Fresno Commissioning Committee on School District Organization.

01:39:33.201 --> 01:39:37.161
I was in the overflow room, so I apologize for being a little bit out of breath.

01:39:39.462 --> 01:39:39.822
The question?

01:39:41.314 --> 01:39:48.699
So apparently the district has a, they released their superintendent on leave a month ago and they're also looking for a CBO.

01:39:48.719 --> 01:39:50.360
So it's not a big district.

01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:55.764
It's 4,400 kids and they're missing two really key leaders of the current district.

01:39:55.804 --> 01:40:06.591
So I just wondered if there was clearly some instability at the senior management level and just wonder if there's just a combination, if there's any information you could share with us that would help us.

01:40:06.611 --> 01:40:11.094
It seems like there's just a lot of instability going on in this district right now.

01:40:12.435 --> 01:40:14.536
Certainly, the district faces challenges.

01:40:15.377 --> 01:40:21.441
I can report that it is the only district in Fresno County that is in a qualified status right now.

01:40:21.461 --> 01:40:26.625
In a qualified fiscal status?

01:40:29.467 --> 01:40:29.788
Correct.

01:40:32.722 --> 01:40:39.344
FCMAT, the fiscal crisis and management team has been tasked to go out there and they're working with them.

01:40:40.184 --> 01:40:42.605
The challenges exist, however, I can tell you that.

01:40:43.965 --> 01:40:47.406
The district did submit a fiscal recovery plan.

01:40:48.086 --> 01:40:56.488
Candidly, that seems to be predicated primarily on negotiated items with their collective bargaining unit that have yet to actually be negotiated.

01:40:57.748 --> 01:41:00.009
So, there appears at this point to be essentially a

01:41:00.979 --> 01:41:05.402
a structural fiscal deficit of about 1.5 to 1.8 million dollars.

01:41:06.982 --> 01:41:07.623
That is correct.

01:41:07.663 --> 01:41:08.103
Yes, ma'am.

01:41:09.184 --> 01:41:09.604
Yes, ma'am.

01:41:09.804 --> 01:41:10.945
It is not clear.

01:41:11.025 --> 01:41:15.047
Currently, they're drawing down on reserves to meet their bills.

01:41:15.207 --> 01:41:18.989
It is not clear, however, what the long-term solution is going to be.

01:41:19.749 --> 01:41:25.733
But as I said, the county superintendent and FCMAT are working with the personnel who are out there.

01:41:26.593 --> 01:41:29.135
They are indeed looking for a new superintendent and a new CBO.

01:41:30.433 --> 01:41:31.814
So it is a difficult situation.

01:41:31.834 --> 01:41:35.418
I don't think anybody is saying that it isn't.

01:41:35.438 --> 01:41:39.902
It's just the position of the county committee that this is not the solution to that problem.

01:41:43.772 --> 01:41:49.217
Yeah, I just wanted to clarify before we have another question.

01:41:49.738 --> 01:41:53.181
We have to act on the, this is like a charter petition.

01:41:53.902 --> 01:42:05.513
No, in the sense that we have to act on what is in the petition rather than speculate about what might be if we had build off in a middle school and so on, or can we just freeform it?

01:42:05.533 --> 01:42:06.774
Yeah, this is Mr. Shirey.

01:42:10.862 --> 01:42:12.543
Well, it depends on what you're speculating on.

01:42:12.723 --> 01:42:17.605
You cannot make decisions that a new governing board is going to have to make.

01:42:17.645 --> 01:42:28.791
So you cannot put in the plans and recommendations that they're going to have to build X facility or do whatever to an existing middle school.

01:42:29.111 --> 01:42:35.434
That's nothing that you cannot commit a governing board to take those actions.

01:42:36.295 --> 01:42:40.117
The flexibility you have is in terms of how you divide assets

01:42:41.235 --> 01:42:54.902
of the existing schooling, the school district, how bond and indebtedness gets divided, issues related to, and that's primarily the area that you have flexibility in terms of what you can put in the plans and recommendations of the proposal.

01:42:58.163 --> 01:42:58.563
Excuse me?

01:42:58.864 --> 01:42:59.724
Go ahead.

01:43:01.349 --> 01:43:01.589
Right.

01:43:01.689 --> 01:43:10.432
You know, once you approve it, you're going to have to determine what goes in the plans and recommendations that the voters can read and understand when they vote.

01:43:10.972 --> 01:43:24.777
And in that will be size of governing board, how bonds will be divided, how assets and obligations will be divided just to give the voters some information about what the reorganization would accomplish.

01:43:24.997 --> 01:43:26.997
So then it goes back to the voter.

01:43:27.778 --> 01:43:28.798
So if we were to

01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:31.463
give it, move it to the next step.

01:43:31.883 --> 01:43:33.285
It's still not approved at this point.

01:43:33.305 --> 01:43:38.452
No, it has to go back to the county because it is a project under the California Environmental Quality Act.

01:43:38.873 --> 01:43:43.599
So, you as a state board, you're the lead agency for that.

01:43:45.188 --> 01:43:53.415
you know, someone at the local level will have to take fiscal responsibility for completing the CEQA analysis under your oversight.

01:43:54.135 --> 01:43:58.539
So when they finish that process, they will then bring that back.

01:43:58.599 --> 01:44:10.128
We will then, the department will then present to you the findings of CEQA and then this action item again with any updated information we have for your final action to determine whether to disapprove.

01:44:10.148 --> 01:44:10.869
Excuse me.

01:44:12.042 --> 01:44:13.342
That's going to take some time, right?

01:44:13.382 --> 01:44:20.944
I'm not sure, you know, it can take, you know, the last environmental impact report that if that's what it goes to.

01:44:22.825 --> 01:44:27.706
Some of you may remember Wiseburn School District, you know, we had that here 10 years.

01:44:29.486 --> 01:44:35.168
Because one of the things is that about CEQA is it's so easy to litigate.

01:44:36.528 --> 01:44:40.789
It's, you know, things can just get expensive and they can and things start,

01:44:41.630 --> 01:44:47.917
You know, we've tried many, many times to get reorganizations out from under the CEQA umbrella, but it doesn't work.

01:44:49.098 --> 01:44:49.598
Superintendent.

01:44:49.818 --> 01:44:50.820
Just a couple of observations.

01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:54.503
I'm glad Board Member Strauss brought up that there are other alternatives.

01:44:55.024 --> 01:45:00.590
And regardless of how you all decide today on this petition, seems

01:45:01.210 --> 01:45:07.897
there's something seriously amiss in the district, in the community, and it needs a facilitation, intervention.

01:45:07.937 --> 01:45:10.199
I'm going to talk to Carl Cohn and Sue Burr.

01:45:10.459 --> 01:45:12.361
I'm on the collaborative.

01:45:13.602 --> 01:45:17.746
This is an issue that even whichever way you went on the decision,

01:45:18.729 --> 01:45:23.111
If you went forward with a separate district, it's a five-year process.

01:45:23.131 --> 01:45:28.594
In the meantime, kids are compromised, communication seems very dysfunctional.

01:45:29.374 --> 01:45:41.480
So I'm letting you know that one way or the other, whatever you're doing, I think we need to go back to the community and I'll try to find some resources with Carl Cohen and the collaborative.

01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:43.281
This is just a kind of a situation actually.

01:45:44.221 --> 01:45:45.542
The collaborative is designed to

01:45:46.183 --> 01:45:49.870
be available to help with, so just wanted to give you that information.

01:45:49.890 --> 01:45:51.714
Board Member Ruckers next.

01:45:55.620 --> 01:45:58.441
So I want to begin also by thanking the department staff.

01:45:58.481 --> 01:46:12.167
I've been on the board now for a number of years and I'm always impressed not only by the expertise that the staff has in presenting these very technical issues to the board and developing very clear and concise reports.

01:46:12.607 --> 01:46:15.629
I also want to thank the parents and the community members

01:46:16.129 --> 01:46:17.409
who came to speak today.

01:46:17.469 --> 01:46:29.652
I know that I felt your frustration in speaking for a minute, but, you know, if you only have a minute, I want you to know everything that you had to say really and truly was heard.

01:46:30.512 --> 01:46:37.673
When people outside of the state of California think about this state, there are five cities that immediately come to their mind.

01:46:38.373 --> 01:46:40.834
And Coalinga, Huron is not one of them.

01:46:41.721 --> 01:46:58.776
But I will say as a child of the military, for me, thinking about small towns and hometowns for a person who grew up moving every single year, Coalinga and Huron are definitely the cities in my mind that came to my mind as a picture of what California really is.

01:46:58.796 --> 01:47:08.184
And it's not because they represent small towns, but they represent the kind of small towns that I came from in Mississippi.

01:47:09.005 --> 01:47:17.108
These small towns have deep roots, they have big family structures, and they have norms and patterns as a community in which they operate.

01:47:17.628 --> 01:47:25.851
But those deep roots also include a lot of long-standing dysfunction and privilege that people have a hard time of letting go of.

01:47:26.351 --> 01:47:29.672
And so I understand that and I heard that very clearly.

01:47:30.914 --> 01:47:56.873
One of the things, one of the reasons why yesterday I was hanging on to so hard about the issue of accountability and what our new accountability system is supposed to do and my dissatisfaction with what was written in the state plan and my concerns about what the staff presented to us about the draft intervention plan is that nothing we approved yesterday is going to address

01:47:57.353 --> 01:48:04.537
or hold accountable the school board in Kuala Lumpur, Iran to stop what they have been doing for all of these years.

01:48:04.917 --> 01:48:06.898
And so, that is my concern.

01:48:07.518 --> 01:48:09.579
So, let's take a look at the criteria.

01:48:09.599 --> 01:48:14.602
The nine criteria that the staff went through cover a lot of issues.

01:48:14.982 --> 01:48:19.104
And the most serious and compelling issues are about the fiscal concerns.

01:48:19.904 --> 01:48:31.817
Added to the fact that this district has a qualified status, it only magnifies the concerns about what criteria the new district could not possibly meet.

01:48:32.337 --> 01:48:39.245
In my over and this, Larry, I'm going to tell you right now, the next sentence I'm going to state is incorrect, but I'm saying it to make a point.

01:48:39.705 --> 01:48:47.909
If the district is already in a qualified financial status, splitting the district into two districts only doubles the financial problem.

01:48:48.149 --> 01:48:59.554
And I do know that that's an inaccurate statement, but in my mind, in my way of understanding what that status is actually going to do, it's not going to solve the qualified financial status.

01:48:59.614 --> 01:49:03.096
It's actually going to create problems for both new districts.

01:49:03.556 --> 01:49:04.737
I have that concern.

01:49:06.277 --> 01:49:14.845
But what I have not heard and one of the things that was very clear, one of the issues that was very clearly discussed by the community members who came.

01:49:16.218 --> 01:49:21.000
is the criteria and the issues that the law does not allow me to consider.

01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:34.706
The fact that there were very poor practices in leadership in providing equity, in the equitable distribution of power and recognition and school support for those students.

01:49:35.166 --> 01:49:38.948
Those are not things that the criteria allows me to consider.

01:49:39.488 --> 01:49:52.696
But those are the things, when you look at me, that are closest and dearest to my heart, because I stand on the shoulders of my cousins and my family members who had to deal with those same things.

01:49:53.136 --> 01:49:56.598
And to the young man who's going to UC Davis, go Aggies.

01:49:56.678 --> 01:49:59.700
I'm a Davis alumni, so congratulations.

01:50:00.180 --> 01:50:04.323
But the problem is, that's not the criteria I'm allowed to consider.

01:50:05.664 --> 01:50:12.112
When I took my oath of office to sit in this chair, I had to uphold the laws of this state.

01:50:12.452 --> 01:50:24.186
And the criteria that I'm supposed to consider in making the decision about this application does not allow me to consider the fact that you have people in elected office

01:50:24.727 --> 01:50:29.370
who are not upholding their responsibility to the people in that community.

01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:40.397
But I'm not allowed to consider that and they have to rely on my responsibility and obligation as a public official not to consider their misbehavior and their misdeeds.

01:50:40.898 --> 01:50:46.982
So the question about what alternatives does the board have doesn't rest on what we can approve today.

01:50:47.442 --> 01:50:54.367
Because anything that's approved or disapproved, if we approve the petition to allow the two districts to split,

01:50:55.427 --> 01:51:01.430
A child who is in kindergarten today will graduate from high school before a new high school will open.

01:51:01.930 --> 01:51:23.498
So what is going to happen in the interim, in the period of time where the lawsuits and the CEQA challenges and all of the reviews that have to be done to create this new district and establish this new governance is going on, what corrections can happen to address the dysfunction in governance that's very clearly occurring in this district?

01:51:23.818 --> 01:51:30.561
What did we approve yesterday in our state plan concerning ESSA that will get the district's attention?

01:51:30.801 --> 01:51:39.945
In what way does the accountability system and all the information the dashboard is supposed to say to help districts pay attention to what they should be correcting?

01:51:40.285 --> 01:51:49.208
How is that going to approve or improve teaching and learning and the quality of the educational experience for those students in the interim?

01:51:49.749 --> 01:51:52.670
These are things I am not allowed to consider.

01:51:53.490 --> 01:51:56.151
So what does disapproving this petition mean?

01:51:56.772 --> 01:52:03.415
Obviously, for the people who are in charge, for the board members who have the three to two majority, it simply means they've won.

01:52:03.735 --> 01:52:13.940
Because I heard nothing from the district when they made their presentation to recognize and show an understanding of the fact that there is a problem.

01:52:14.340 --> 01:52:18.022
And what I'm more concerned about if I follow the requirements of the law,

01:52:18.582 --> 01:52:25.747
We will change nothing and the governing structure and the governing behavior of the current school board will not change.

01:52:26.128 --> 01:52:47.063
And I can say that with an assurance because I heard nothing from the people who made a presentation representing the district to say that they understand the purpose and the reasons behind this petition have more to do with poor management and poor behavior on district leadership than the actual issues and the desire to create a community identity.

01:52:47.643 --> 01:52:49.004
by creating a new district.

01:52:49.344 --> 01:52:52.866
And this district has chosen to ignore all of those things.

01:52:53.286 --> 01:52:54.687
So I have a great concern.

01:52:55.047 --> 01:53:06.613
I'm very concerned about what the dysfunction in this community that is longstanding and that it cannot be addressed by either decision from this board in deciding this petition.

01:53:07.114 --> 01:53:15.218
And I remain concerned that no matter what we decide, those concerns will remain longstanding and in place.

01:53:16.516 --> 01:53:18.036
So I'd like some advice on that.

01:53:20.377 --> 01:53:20.597
Yeah.

01:53:21.337 --> 01:53:22.037
Trish Williams.

01:53:25.018 --> 01:53:28.678
So this is a, this is quite the dilemma here.

01:53:29.298 --> 01:53:43.621
And to hear that the district is qualified and dipping into reserves, losing their CBO, don't have a superintendent is disturbing about the district.

01:53:44.901 --> 01:53:48.324
and the governance and the management.

01:53:49.025 --> 01:54:08.324
I am compelled and moved by the Huron parents and former students whose messages were very consistent in terms of how left out they felt, how misunderstood or deliberately not understood.

01:54:09.381 --> 01:54:23.892
I can picture in my eyes, in my mind, going on an hour bus ride every day and getting to get to the high school, missing out on before and after school activities, and getting behind.

01:54:23.932 --> 01:54:38.283
If there's research that correlates long distance travel, which makes sense to me, getting to school, making it difficult with dropout, with chronic absence, then I can see that group of kids being funneled over to the continuation schools.

01:54:38.823 --> 01:54:41.846
not being put in the A through G or AP classes.

01:54:41.966 --> 01:54:44.848
I can see how that could just go on and on.

01:54:46.469 --> 01:54:53.855
But what also was, and I'm not going to cut, I don't have a solution for what exactly approve or don't approve.

01:54:54.496 --> 01:55:03.883
But this interim, this intermediate kind of solution that member Strauss was talking about in terms of the, does it have to be a brand new high school?

01:55:04.424 --> 01:55:06.625
Could it be a middle high school?

01:55:08.287 --> 01:55:11.108
I mean, I even thought, could it be a charter school?

01:55:12.009 --> 01:55:20.854
There's all kinds of ways maybe for Huron to not, that would solve a not have to travel that long distance problem.

01:55:21.475 --> 01:55:25.297
Doesn't solve all the problems, but that would solve that problem.

01:55:25.977 --> 01:55:29.460
But it feels to me that if Koalinga

01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:38.609
is in this kind of fiscal shape, the last thing they want to have happen is for Huron to take their students to their own school district.

01:55:39.269 --> 01:55:45.836
That is not going to help Coalinga's fiscal condition.

01:55:45.956 --> 01:55:49.800
It's going to make it worse if these students go into their own district.

01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:52.522
So if I were in charge of Coalinga,

01:55:53.579 --> 01:56:15.621
and that were a situation and I had this, had been in this meeting and heard what was being said and I needed those students, then I would recognize that I need their parents and their family and that community support and that they have some very legitimate concerns and problems that I had better start addressing.

01:56:16.869 --> 01:56:25.175
if I want them to work with me to make sure that this whole district is fiscally sound again, can be fiscally sound again.

01:56:25.195 --> 01:56:34.082
I would give a lot to make sure they wanted to be in that district and find ways to work with, I heard superintendent,

01:56:35.563 --> 01:56:53.833
Torlakson say that he can have some people facilitate and work with the whole community to see if there can't be something in between the breakup of the district, but no longer going on with the ignoring of the needs of Huron and its families and its students.

01:56:54.414 --> 01:56:58.876
That's what I would hope would happen regardless of the vote on the breakup or not breakup.

01:56:58.896 --> 01:57:00.517
Board Member Sun.

01:57:02.954 --> 01:57:08.759
What would have been the ADA number for this new district?

01:57:08.779 --> 01:57:09.640
1,500, something like that?

01:57:10.101 --> 01:57:12.303
It was about 1,570, I think.

01:57:12.403 --> 01:57:17.768
I know there was some concern expressed by the petitioners.

01:57:18.450 --> 01:57:22.896
But, you know, that was kind of an apple to oranges comparison.

01:57:23.216 --> 01:57:23.556
So under 2000.

01:57:24.077 --> 01:57:32.628
ADA, the numbers they threw out, the district number of 1620 is an enrollment figure, which is actually would be lower if it... Right, for ADA.

01:57:33.128 --> 01:57:33.268
Yeah.

01:57:33.909 --> 01:57:36.391
The other two numbers were based on census data.

01:57:36.791 --> 01:57:39.654
Certainly the Census Bureau numbers were census data.

01:57:39.694 --> 01:57:48.201
And I'm assuming that the demographer who they hired to redraw trustee areas, they typically use census data.

01:57:49.382 --> 01:57:55.927
I haven't worked directly with census data in a while, but I don't recall them being able to identify people in high school.

01:57:56.307 --> 01:57:59.490
Yeah, I got the ballpark part of this.

01:57:59.550 --> 01:58:00.570
Yeah.

01:58:00.831 --> 01:58:17.683
So, first of all, to the folks who brought this to us, the Huron folks, I hear you and I hear the frustration in your voices and I hear that the desperation in your voices in wanting to create your own district.

01:58:19.084 --> 01:58:23.287
And I would say to you, as I would say to a charter petitioner that

01:58:24.608 --> 01:58:32.614
Yeah, it's very difficult, but you have to have a vision for where you're going, not just running away or trying to get away.

01:58:32.634 --> 01:58:35.136
You've got to have a plan moving forward.

01:58:35.576 --> 01:58:40.640
And certainly with that number, I operated 1,800 student charter school.

01:58:41.220 --> 01:58:42.881
And I can tell you, it is hard.

01:58:43.101 --> 01:58:45.343
It is difficult financially to manage.

01:58:45.863 --> 01:58:56.068
all of that and to want to develop a comprehensive high school with all of the facilities and with the challenges that's in your community, it is a very difficult thing.

01:58:56.168 --> 01:59:01.390
It might sound like, hey, we want to start our own district, but it is a very difficult thing to manage.

01:59:01.870 --> 01:59:14.876
And I would rather see with some inspired leadership somewhere and some assistance that you find some other types of solution within your community.

01:59:15.856 --> 01:59:16.997
And I know that's difficult.

01:59:18.479 --> 01:59:31.970
Just to board member Rucker's point, I could not help as well to look at the dashboard for this district and use it as a test for our system, our accountability system.

01:59:33.031 --> 01:59:37.455
And and as we're kind of working these things out, I think we could.

01:59:37.955 --> 01:59:41.998
These are these are the tests that we can look at to see if the system works.

01:59:43.119 --> 01:59:45.260
But we do currently have a system.

01:59:45.561 --> 01:59:56.509
And I wonder where the county office has been in looking at the district's LCAP and assessing what the what the community input has been on it.

01:59:56.649 --> 02:00:01.593
And just looking at the draft LCAP that's been posted on the district's website, it is incomplete.

02:00:02.273 --> 02:00:02.673
right now.

02:00:03.214 --> 02:00:04.515
I don't see a completed one.

02:00:05.155 --> 02:00:12.341
And that is where our system, we have some oversight right now with the County Office of Education.

02:00:12.481 --> 02:00:14.223
And I'm wondering where that process is.

02:00:14.623 --> 02:00:22.850
So while not necessarily looking at, oh, we now need to figure out at the state level, it doesn't, it's not supposed to all happen to that state level.

02:00:22.890 --> 02:00:28.834
There should have been some local regional oversight before it got to this point.

02:00:32.145 --> 02:00:37.733
So yeah, at some point we need to summarize a decision we have to make.

02:00:38.354 --> 02:00:42.419
And we're getting into a lot of school improvement here.

02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:47.386
And we'd like, I'd like to get us back to what we're, what's on the agenda.

02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:52.361
Ortiz-Lacon and Patricia Rucker again.

02:00:52.621 --> 02:00:56.543
And I do have, I do need clarification on what we're actually voting on.

02:00:56.603 --> 02:01:06.886
But, you know, I think that it's, we have to get into these conversations because yesterday's conversation was so abstract and today is so real and how it all works together.

02:01:08.386 --> 02:01:11.467
I, the good news is that you're now on the radar.

02:01:11.647 --> 02:01:16.769
I have never, I'm Southern California, I have never, I apologize, heard of your district or Huron.

02:01:17.269 --> 02:01:19.229
And now that I do, te quiero mucho, Huron.

02:01:22.810 --> 02:01:24.351
Los quiero y los deseo lo mejor.

02:01:25.331 --> 02:01:31.293
And I'm so glad that Superintendent Torlakson has, wants to pursue this.

02:01:31.833 --> 02:01:35.894
And I think that everyone has made very valid points in terms of where has the oversight been.

02:01:36.254 --> 02:01:37.555
And that's a grave concern.

02:01:38.195 --> 02:01:46.078
In terms of the actual options, I'm still a little lost because I understand that it goes back to the local if we go with the CEQA compliance.

02:01:46.418 --> 02:01:48.079
But then I heard something about the voters.

02:01:48.359 --> 02:01:50.760
So let's go back to the disapprove.

02:01:50.900 --> 02:01:52.880
So if we disapprove, does that kill?

02:01:53.281 --> 02:01:54.821
They cannot start all over again.

02:01:54.901 --> 02:01:55.742
That's the end of it.

02:01:55.842 --> 02:01:57.982
Or they would have to start all over again with their petition.

02:01:58.543 --> 02:02:04.825
And then two, it goes back to the local, it undergoes CEQA, and then it comes back to us so that it could go on a ballot.

02:02:05.425 --> 02:02:10.490
No, it comes back to you for another session like we have right now.

02:02:11.211 --> 02:02:16.556
You're going to have to, it goes back to CEQA, I mean it goes back to the local levels for CEQA compliance.

02:02:17.257 --> 02:02:20.140
And then it's going to come back to you as two action items.

02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:23.543
You're going to have to accept the CEQA findings.

02:02:24.324 --> 02:02:24.844
initially.

02:02:25.165 --> 02:02:30.489
And once you accept those, you move to pretty much an identical situation we have right now.

02:02:30.569 --> 02:02:32.711
We're going to update our analysis.

02:02:32.911 --> 02:02:33.671
Things may change.

02:02:33.711 --> 02:02:34.812
I don't know how long it's going to be.

02:02:35.413 --> 02:02:37.554
It could be five years down the road before.

02:02:37.574 --> 02:02:41.297
It might be a whole new board here.

02:02:41.698 --> 02:02:43.939
But we're going to have to prepare.

02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:53.387
We're going to, you know, I took, you know, going back to Weisbord, I brought four, I brought four, four agenda items to you over ten years.

02:02:53.823 --> 02:02:57.266
So you don't have to bring another agenda item back on the issue.

02:02:57.446 --> 02:03:04.611
And if you decide at that point in time to approve it, it then directs the county superintendent to call an election in the area.

02:03:05.152 --> 02:03:10.856
If it's approved that election, then the district could go into effect the July 1st of the subsequent year.

02:03:12.637 --> 02:03:13.478
OK, board member Rucker.

02:03:15.267 --> 02:03:20.290
So I want to thank board member Ting for bringing up the point that I was making.

02:03:20.370 --> 02:03:24.653
I did because I did not want to go there and get into the conversation about school improvement.

02:03:24.673 --> 02:03:42.744
But what is happening here is happening because we have institutions and artifacts and a framework in place for intervention and support and for redirecting schools when they get into this type of problem and redirecting the work of LEAs.

02:03:43.224 --> 02:03:44.005
It didn't work.

02:03:44.545 --> 02:03:48.828
And so if you ask the question where the county office was, sitting in the county office.

02:03:49.189 --> 02:04:05.302
So I'm trying to be very careful and not sound hypercritical about what happened, but the lack of dysfunction and poor management and work that people who got paid a lot of money to do this should have been going on didn't just stop at the district office in Coalinga, Huron.

02:04:05.822 --> 02:04:11.827
But the problem is, and the question before us, is this the way to solve that problem?

02:04:12.367 --> 02:04:16.989
is voting to approve the petition going to solve the governance problem.

02:04:17.389 --> 02:04:27.813
And if that's the reason why this board would vote to do that, we're using factors to consider that vote other than what the law says we're supposed to consider.

02:04:28.593 --> 02:04:34.676
But there are consequences and there are considerable consequences for voting not to approve the petition.

02:04:35.136 --> 02:04:36.977
And so we have to consider that as well.

02:04:37.017 --> 02:04:40.559
So there are consequences either way this vote goes.

02:04:40.939 --> 02:04:44.621
And both of them are long-term and sustained consequences.

02:04:44.681 --> 02:04:46.822
Anybody who thinks this vote that happens today

02:04:47.362 --> 02:05:08.738
is going to immediately see something change tomorrow, regardless of whether the vote is yes to approve or no to disapprove, doesn't understand the long-term activities that will be in front of not only this board, but the county office, as well as the local school board that will still have to oversee this as the process goes forward.

02:05:09.218 --> 02:05:11.981
So that's the other part that we're not allowed to consider either.

02:05:12.041 --> 02:05:13.162
But that's a reality.

02:05:13.462 --> 02:05:15.124
And that's the elephant in the room.

02:05:15.684 --> 02:05:17.906
It's a large, unmanageable, hot mess.

02:05:18.407 --> 02:05:22.871
And if we vote to approve this, it becomes our mess.

02:05:23.912 --> 02:05:28.176
Well, somebody else's because I'm sure we won't all be on the board for the next 10 years.

02:05:28.891 --> 02:05:42.073
I'd like to call on our liaison and as you then give your views, as you looked at this, whether you saw a viable financial plan for this proposed reorganization.

02:05:42.452 --> 02:05:47.215
So over the years, I ran various charter schools and facilities.

02:05:47.235 --> 02:05:49.737
There's always a real issue with charter schools.

02:05:49.777 --> 02:05:59.504
And I went through the whole process of trying to figure out how to build a new school that would be a middle and high school in American Canyon, actually, was one possibility, and other places.

02:06:00.064 --> 02:06:01.465
And they are very expensive.

02:06:01.766 --> 02:06:02.967
They are very expensive.

02:06:03.027 --> 02:06:04.188
They're very complicated.

02:06:04.288 --> 02:06:10.753
And this state process is lengthy with the state architect and the environmental issues and on and on.

02:06:11.013 --> 02:06:12.374
It's a huge undertaking.

02:06:12.414 --> 02:06:20.801
And when I looked at, along with Larry, with the financial realities of this situation, it would be a huge undertaking.

02:06:20.861 --> 02:06:24.884
And it's very likely that it would fail in a number of ways.

02:06:24.964 --> 02:06:28.267
It's also very likely that it's going to be a severe hardship on

02:06:30.189 --> 02:06:32.831
the remaining district, the Koalinga district.

02:06:33.391 --> 02:06:36.874
But I think all my colleagues have expressed everything.

02:06:36.894 --> 02:06:45.041
This was an easy lead assignment that you all expressed exactly what I was feeling and what I wanted to talk about in that we do care deeply about students.

02:06:45.101 --> 02:06:47.603
We do care deeply about communities.

02:06:47.703 --> 02:06:49.905
We do care deeply about community identities.

02:06:50.405 --> 02:06:54.570
I do think there are other options and other ways of solving this issue.

02:06:55.010 --> 02:07:05.962
I fully respect the superintendent's generous offer to look into this community's struggles and to try to help in every way possible.

02:07:06.282 --> 02:07:09.446
I think there are other resources available such as the coalition.

02:07:09.846 --> 02:07:10.367
I think that

02:07:11.568 --> 02:07:17.354
Member Ting's comment about the county stepping up to the LCAP responsibility is a very important point.

02:07:17.674 --> 02:07:20.838
I do think charter schools are also potentially an option.

02:07:21.298 --> 02:07:24.902
There are lots of other things that maybe you've considered and thought about.

02:07:25.282 --> 02:07:29.347
I do not believe that this is an appropriate

02:07:31.188 --> 02:07:38.012
district reorganization that is in front of us for the reasons that the CDE has articulated.

02:07:38.032 --> 02:07:47.216
And therefore, unfortunately, it's my sad duty, but my duty to make the recommendation to move the staff recommendation.

02:07:48.277 --> 02:07:48.817
Your second?

02:07:51.338 --> 02:07:51.879
No second?

02:07:54.540 --> 02:07:57.041
I will second.

02:07:57.201 --> 02:07:59.042
Any further board discussion?

02:08:01.311 --> 02:08:02.212
Board Member Williams.

02:08:03.614 --> 02:08:10.782
I do think the fact that there isn't a CBO and there isn't a superintendent currently at the district is actually an opening for change.

02:08:13.766 --> 02:08:16.028
It's an opportunity to do something different.

02:08:17.054 --> 02:08:19.156
the board will need to do something different.

02:08:19.356 --> 02:08:36.470
They have this opportunity to pick people that will understand not only your fiscal situation, but understand what brought this community from Huron all the way here to us because they are so desperate for educational opportunities for their children.

02:08:37.191 --> 02:08:39.412
So this is now an opportunity for you.

02:08:40.493 --> 02:08:56.393
And if we can get the Collaborative for Education Excellence involved and get the county to oversee more closely how you are, what's in your LCAP and whether or not you're including the community of Huron and giving, going to them.

02:08:57.014 --> 02:09:03.840
not asking them to take an hour bus to you, but going to them to give input into the LCAP, express what they need.

02:09:04.221 --> 02:09:12.448
You have a really good opportunity here to serve them as well as better serve and better manage your organization.

02:09:12.508 --> 02:09:20.476
And I hope, Superintendent Torlakson, that, you know, I will count on you to follow through to get the right people involved to make that happen.

02:09:20.996 --> 02:09:22.658
And look forward to hearing an update.

02:09:25.563 --> 02:09:26.484
Board Member Sandoval.

02:09:27.545 --> 02:09:38.835
I just want to just express my appreciation to all of you just for presenting today and the thorough work that was done by the department.

02:09:40.036 --> 02:09:41.697
The fact that 43% of your students leave school

02:09:45.260 --> 02:09:49.204
have to travel two to three hours round trip every day.

02:09:50.025 --> 02:09:50.786
There's no excuse.

02:09:50.826 --> 02:09:51.706
There are solutions.

02:09:51.746 --> 02:09:54.769
There are ways to support you in your development.

02:09:54.849 --> 02:10:05.260
So I'm sorry that it took this long to get the attention of people to support you and your community.

02:10:05.820 --> 02:10:08.202
And so now you have a lot more people watching.

02:10:09.303 --> 02:10:16.987
And there's no excuse for the lack of educational resources and support that you've suffered through.

02:10:17.707 --> 02:10:24.550
So you have the attention now at the state level and I hope at the county level in a much bigger way.

02:10:25.431 --> 02:10:32.014
And my hope is that we can help transform the outcomes for you and your community.

02:10:32.074 --> 02:10:34.755
And this was not an easy decision to make at all.

02:10:36.206 --> 02:10:36.406
Okay.

02:10:36.806 --> 02:10:38.087
We're not ready for a vote yet.

02:10:38.267 --> 02:10:40.268
I'd like to move to a vote fairly soon.

02:10:42.630 --> 02:10:43.010
Okay.

02:10:43.150 --> 02:10:43.910
You ready for a vote?

02:10:44.551 --> 02:10:44.791
Good.

02:10:45.011 --> 02:10:45.351
Okay.

02:10:45.931 --> 02:10:50.694
I think let's call a roll on this because we had trouble getting a second.

02:10:50.754 --> 02:10:55.597
So let's start there with Holiday and go around.

02:10:55.817 --> 02:10:56.477
Bruce Holiday.

02:10:57.118 --> 02:10:57.298
Yes.

02:10:57.818 --> 02:10:58.058
Yes.

02:10:58.298 --> 02:10:59.079
Nikki Sandoval.

02:11:00.419 --> 02:11:01.260
Olivia Sison.

02:11:02.901 --> 02:11:03.561
Trish Williams.

02:11:04.562 --> 02:11:05.102
Ting Sung.

02:11:06.584 --> 02:11:07.164
Mike Kirst?

02:11:07.404 --> 02:11:07.664
Yes.

02:11:08.645 --> 02:11:09.425
Elaine Strauss?

02:11:11.025 --> 02:11:11.105
Yes.

02:11:11.165 --> 02:11:12.425
Felisa Ortiz-Lucon?

02:11:14.466 --> 02:11:14.586
No.

02:11:14.626 --> 02:11:15.486
And Patricia Rucker?

02:11:15.646 --> 02:11:15.786
No.

02:11:15.806 --> 02:11:17.947
Okay, it passes.

02:11:19.887 --> 02:11:20.588
Seven to two.

02:11:20.968 --> 02:11:28.890
Okay, so that item is complete and I think the board needs a break, so we will come back at 20 of 12.

02:11:38.473 --> 02:11:40.013
Okay, the board will reconvene.

02:11:40.813 --> 02:11:41.834
We have six members.

02:11:41.974 --> 02:11:44.134
I'm counting Ortiz-Lacombe.

02:11:44.734 --> 02:11:46.615
We will proceed to item 19.

02:11:47.155 --> 02:11:55.356
Petition for the establishment of a charter school under the oversight of the State Board of Education, Sweetwater Secondary School.

02:11:56.016 --> 02:12:00.037
So we're ready now for the CDE presentation on this.

02:12:03.358 --> 02:12:04.558
CDE presentation.

02:12:41.067 --> 02:12:42.550
Okay, we're ready, Cindy, for you.

02:12:42.570 --> 02:12:49.265
We've already called the roll and we have our quorum if you're ready.

02:13:40.833 --> 02:13:49.125
Okay, good morning Board President Kirst, members of the Board, I'm Cindy Tan, Director of the Charter Schools Division at the California Department of Education.

02:13:50.385 --> 02:14:02.253
Item 19 is an appeal by Sweetwater Secondary School to establish a new charter school, which was denied by the Sweetwater Union High School District and the San Diego County Board of Education.

02:14:03.114 --> 02:14:13.321
Pursuant to statute, petitioners for a charter school that have been denied at the local level may petition the State Board of Education for approval subject to certain conditions.

02:14:15.239 --> 02:14:23.426
The CDE received the Sweetwater petition on March 3rd and staff have reviewed the petition documents and information submitted by the petitioner.

02:14:24.466 --> 02:14:33.053
And based on our review, we are recommending that the State Board hold a public hearing and thereafter approve with technical amendments and three conditions.

02:14:33.714 --> 02:14:40.399
The request to establish Sweetwater under the oversight of the State Board for a five-year term effective July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2022.

02:14:44.783 --> 02:14:47.624
Our recommendation includes the following three conditions.

02:14:48.105 --> 02:15:05.356
So condition one, Sweetwater may contract with Student Success Programs, Incorporated, Altus Institute, Incorporated, Altus Muras, Incorporated, Altus Laurel, Incorporated, or any other affiliated or related organizations.

02:15:06.076 --> 02:15:32.263
for goods and or services if all such related entities agree to timely respond to all CDE inquiries into their operations including but not limited to management, fiscal, personnel, procurement, programmatic, advocacy, outreach, professional development, supervisory, facilities operations, facilities financing, and service agreements.

02:15:33.063 --> 02:15:45.689
in accordance with Education Code Section 47604.3 and fully cooperate with any investigation into their operations conducted pursuant to Education Code Section 47604.4.

02:15:48.910 --> 02:16:09.034
Condition 2, Student Success Programs Incorporated, Altus Institute Incorporated, Altus Meris Incorporated and Altus Laurel Incorporated and or any other affiliates agree to timely respond to all CD inquiries regarding negotiations, revisions and or amendments.

02:16:09.734 --> 02:16:23.901
to master agreements between Sweetwater and any of the related entities, and to provide the CDE with a reasonable opportunity to review any new agreements entered into between Sweetwater and any affiliates.

02:16:24.661 --> 02:16:37.288
And condition three, Sweetwater must adhere to the terms and conditions as noted in attachment one of the item, which is the California State Board of Education standard conditions on opening and operation.

02:16:38.728 --> 02:16:54.953
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools considered the Sweetwater petition at its June 7th meeting and unanimously voted to approve CDE's recommendation that the State Board approve the Sweetwater petition with the technical amendments and conditions proposed by the CDE.

02:16:56.937 --> 02:17:22.675
Sweetwater is modeled after the Charter School of San Diego, which is a charter school authorized by the San Diego Unified School District and will provide an independent study homeschool setting with a focus on providing a personalized educational program for its pupils with special emphasis on expanding learning opportunities for pupils who are identified as academically low achieving.

02:17:23.797 --> 02:17:29.505
Sweetwater proposes to serve 300 pupils in grade 7 through grade 12 in 2017-18, its first year of operation, expanding to 480 pupils in grade 7 through grade 12 by year 4, 2021.

02:17:40.421 --> 02:17:55.021
Sweetwater proposes to operate three resource centers located within the boundaries of the Sweetwater Union High School District that currently operate under the Charter School San Diego, a charter school authorized by San Diego Unified School District.

02:17:55.081 --> 02:17:57.004
So as you recall, and we didn't have

02:17:57.504 --> 02:18:10.456
an item that I presented for you at this meeting, but the board approved a waiver policy in March and you have seen before you a couple of sets of waivers that have dealt with a recent court decision that came down.

02:18:10.476 --> 02:18:12.277
We've referred to it as Anderson.

02:18:12.858 --> 02:18:16.141
It was a decision, an appellate court decision that

02:18:17.501 --> 02:18:28.223
clarified the law that states that charter schools that operate resource centers, non-classroom based charter schools, they have to comply with the boundary requirements as classroom based schools.

02:18:28.283 --> 02:18:39.986
So the kind of the, to summarize, a charter school resource center must operate within the boundaries of its authorizing school district or an adjacent county subject to certain conditions.

02:18:40.806 --> 02:18:46.569
So the Sweetwater petition was first submitted to Sweetwater Union High School District in October 2016.

02:18:47.150 --> 02:18:56.895
And so while this was prior to the final Anderson court decision, I think there was some confusion as to maybe what was provided in the petition.

02:18:57.935 --> 02:19:06.701
It was before the final decision and I don't know if it was, you know, foresight on their part or if they just had chose to seek separate authorization.

02:19:07.782 --> 02:19:12.125
By doing so, this is one of the compliance measures of that court decision.

02:19:12.265 --> 02:19:23.192
So charter schools that are operating non-compliant resource centers, they can either close them down, they can get a new charter in that district where they're operating and that's what this charter school chose to do.

02:19:23.613 --> 02:19:25.574
They were denied so they're here before you today.

02:19:25.674 --> 02:19:27.115
So this is one of the compliant

02:19:28.336 --> 02:19:28.596
Yes.

02:19:28.836 --> 02:19:29.076
Yes.

02:19:29.396 --> 02:19:29.557
Yep.

02:19:29.617 --> 02:19:30.377
We already have two.

02:19:30.817 --> 02:19:33.079
And so I'll go into that with the governance section.

02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:36.901
So department staff have reviewed this.

02:19:36.941 --> 02:19:41.465
We wrote a petition supporting documents and we find that it meets the standards and criteria.

02:19:42.025 --> 02:19:49.130
Requirements provides a reasonably comprehensive description of the required elements with our technical amendments that we're recommending.

02:19:49.810 --> 02:20:00.496
We also reviewed the Sweetwater multi-year fiscal plan, which we note kind of similar to the Grossmont petition that was brought before you at the last meeting.

02:20:01.016 --> 02:20:04.138
There is an unsubstantiated resource included.

02:20:04.158 --> 02:20:11.042
It was $500,000, a beginning cash balance with no assumptions or narrative.

02:20:12.143 --> 02:20:21.074
On March 30th, the Board of Student Success Programs Incorporated, which is another organization that we had mentioned in our recommendation.

02:20:22.771 --> 02:20:34.918
They approved a resolution to transfer funds from a resource center of theirs, a positive net balance of funds upon granting of a duly authorized charter petition.

02:20:34.998 --> 02:20:39.641
And by doing so, Sweetwater received no less than a little over a million dollars.

02:20:40.161 --> 02:20:50.687
However, since the transfer of funds we found per that resolution is contingent upon a number of things happening, we have excluded those monies from our budget assumptions.

02:20:51.427 --> 02:21:02.399
By doing so, it brings their cash balance down to roughly $120,000 and the reserves just right below 5%.

02:21:03.240 --> 02:21:04.482
So it's fairly close.

02:21:04.902 --> 02:21:10.709
Therefore, we don't have the same condition we're proposing that we did in the gross amount because they're right around the marker.

02:21:11.590 --> 02:21:24.628
However, if that transfer of funds does not occur, then we would require their board, if they're approved, we would require the board to submit a new budget that shows them at the level of cash that they do receive.

02:21:25.686 --> 02:21:30.049
So lastly, I just kind of want to walk through the governance structure of the charter school.

02:21:30.089 --> 02:21:33.892
This was a little bit of a discussion at the main meeting, if you recall.

02:21:34.752 --> 02:21:42.718
And so similar to one of the other ones, I'm just going to say the celerity schools, we talked a little bit about their governance structure.

02:21:42.838 --> 02:21:44.700
And I didn't have any sort of handout.

02:21:45.180 --> 02:21:47.041
We were doing like airbox drawings.

02:21:47.141 --> 02:21:50.984
So I brought you an organization chart.

02:21:51.004 --> 02:21:53.065
This was actually provided by the charter school.

02:21:53.105 --> 02:21:54.907
So it is not something that we drafted.

02:21:55.667 --> 02:21:59.648
and it is also in one of the attachments that's part of the item.

02:21:59.808 --> 02:22:07.470
So the public was made available to this, but I've pulled it out because the attachments are so large, it would be hard for you to find it.

02:22:08.070 --> 02:22:18.633
But this kind of gives you an idea of the governance structure that the Sweetwater School has in their petition, and you can actually visualize that.

02:22:19.313 --> 02:22:30.801
So the Sweetwater petition states that Sweetwater shall be operated by Audeo Charter School Corporation, which is a California non-profit public benefit corporation pursuant to California law.

02:22:30.821 --> 02:22:46.752
Audeo Charter School Corporation is organized and operated exclusively for educational and charitable purposes pursuant to and exclusively, excuse me, pursuant to and within the meaning of Section 501C3 of the Internal Revenue Code.

02:22:47.913 --> 02:22:58.139
The corporation is responsible for Sweetwater's operational management and shall operate within the terms and conditions specified in the charter and its governing documents.

02:22:59.839 --> 02:23:10.285
Sweetwater shall be governed by the Idea Charter School Corporation non-profit board of directors in accordance with its adopted corporate bylaws consistent with the terms of the charter.

02:23:11.086 --> 02:23:14.888
All directors shall be designated by the existing board of directors.

02:23:15.988 --> 02:23:24.833
So as you can see in the organization chart, Audeo Charter School Corporation currently operates two charter schools, both authorized by the state board.

02:23:25.633 --> 02:23:33.077
One was approved in 2016, Audeo Charter School 2, and Grossmont Secondary School was recently authorized in May.

02:23:33.857 --> 02:23:41.141
So that one is going to open in the fall and Audeo Charter School is going into its second year of operation.

02:23:42.256 --> 02:24:00.391
So based on the discussion we had at the last meeting and there was an organization chart that was sort of handed out at the meeting and we could not authenticate that because it was not part of the charter petition for Grossmont nor was it something provided to you at that time by the petitioner.

02:24:00.951 --> 02:24:10.838
So we actually reached out for clarity and for clarification to the Sweetwater petitioners to get some more information.

02:24:11.038 --> 02:24:28.210
We ended up getting this organization chart as well as some other documents to look at their governance organizations associated with the corporation, Audeo Charter School Corporation, including the names and titles of officers for each of the schools and those organizations.

02:24:28.930 --> 02:24:42.806
We find that the organization chart that's in front of you that's also in one of the attachments for Adeo Charter School Corporation reflects the governance structure that is outlined in the charter petition and in the governing documents.

02:24:43.647 --> 02:24:59.316
However, in light of having recent discussions on some very complex governance structures we have seen in some other appeals that have been brought before you, we requested that additional information from the petitioner.

02:24:59.496 --> 02:25:10.282
And we find that some of these documents provide evidence that Audeo Charter School Corporation has affiliations with other organizations, as you can see in the chart.

02:25:11.563 --> 02:25:17.727
and also noted in our recommended conditions and that there are common officers among these organizations.

02:25:18.648 --> 02:25:40.843
So as such, we felt that if the charter school is ultimately approved, we feel like the conditions we have proposed are prudent and also we hope that they serve a goal to provide additional means necessary for the department to provide effective and meaningful oversight of the charter school if it is approved.

02:25:41.804 --> 02:25:48.450
So in summary, I just want to state that the petition is consistent with sound educational practice based on our review.

02:25:49.171 --> 02:26:01.284
The petitioner is likely to implement the intended program and the petition provides a reasonably comprehensive description of the required elements, noting that some do require a technical amendment that we're proposing.

02:26:02.004 --> 02:26:13.675
We recommend that the State Board hold a public hearing and approve the petition to establish Sweetwater under the oversight of the State Board with our conditions and technical amendments that we're recommending.

02:26:14.375 --> 02:26:23.143
So I believe both the petitioner and I think the district is here to present to the Board and I'm here to answer any questions that you may have.

02:26:23.243 --> 02:26:25.304
Yeah, we're going to have some technical questions first.

02:26:25.364 --> 02:26:26.364
Board Member Holliday.

02:26:26.544 --> 02:26:27.165
I'm sorry, Cindy.

02:26:27.525 --> 02:26:29.186
Yeah, I have a technical question too.

02:26:29.286 --> 02:26:29.786
Please stay.

02:26:29.966 --> 02:26:32.507
Did you say that the ACCS voted unanimously?

02:26:33.888 --> 02:26:34.068
Yeah.

02:26:35.048 --> 02:26:36.048
I believe there was one.

02:26:36.068 --> 02:26:38.590
It was 60.

02:26:38.670 --> 02:26:41.451
I believe there was one member of the ACCS that voted no.

02:26:41.511 --> 02:26:43.011
I just wanted to correct that for the record.

02:26:43.051 --> 02:26:43.592
No, you're right.

02:26:43.692 --> 02:26:45.953
I think it was Commissioner Washington.

02:26:46.153 --> 02:26:46.453
Correct.

02:26:47.472 --> 02:26:49.053
Hey, I have a question.

02:26:50.333 --> 02:26:54.174
So we've been looking and we've had some prior hearings on this.

02:26:54.274 --> 02:27:01.797
And so I'm looking at this chart and Mary Bixby is on Odeo Charter School Corporation.

02:27:02.577 --> 02:27:04.418
She also is the president.

02:27:04.818 --> 02:27:06.258
She's the president of Odeo.

02:27:06.339 --> 02:27:09.660
She's the president of Student Success Programs Corporation.

02:27:10.780 --> 02:27:13.843
My first question, are corporations are usually profit?

02:27:13.923 --> 02:27:15.104
Are these for profit?

02:27:15.844 --> 02:27:23.551
Secondly, and lastly, she is the President and CEO of Altus Mirus Inc., Incorporated.

02:27:23.611 --> 02:27:27.034
That strikes me as usually profit if it's incorporated.

02:27:27.774 --> 02:27:30.196
So, can you explain this relationships?

02:27:30.296 --> 02:27:35.200
We've seen these in some prior ones and they've suggested issues.

02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:39.104
And so, how does that, how does all this work?

02:27:39.884 --> 02:27:45.335
what is a corporation in this case, who is Altus Mirus, and so on.

02:27:47.748 --> 02:27:58.456
I'm going to go back and look at another document, but I believe that at least on Odeo Charter School Corporation, which is, this is the governance structure of the school, all of the schools that the State Board has approved.

02:27:58.776 --> 02:28:01.338
That's a nonprofit public benefit corporation.

02:28:02.218 --> 02:28:06.962
The other two student success programs, I believe, is as well.

02:28:07.022 --> 02:28:10.104
We don't have information on Altus Muris.

02:28:10.604 --> 02:28:12.646
That was one that we don't have any additional information.

02:28:13.366 --> 02:28:18.670
able to get audit reports for Charter School San Diego and Odeo Charter School.

02:28:18.690 --> 02:28:27.677
So it speaks a little bit to the governance of student success programs, but we don't have one for that third box, the green one, Altus Muris.

02:28:28.037 --> 02:28:29.739
We don't have any information on that one.

02:28:31.720 --> 02:28:34.143
And there were some recent changes that were noted.

02:28:34.223 --> 02:28:44.513
I mean, the one thing we did look at that made it a little more complicated with some of the other petitions was this sort of sole statutory member that did exist at one point in these organizations.

02:28:45.033 --> 02:28:48.357
But in early 2016, they did a corporate restructure.

02:28:49.177 --> 02:28:54.121
and they remove that sole statutory member from their governance.

02:28:54.201 --> 02:29:09.851
And so each one of these, aside from the Altus Muris, which I don't have your information, but it appears that Aldeo Charter School Corporation, Student Success Programs Corporation are now like separate entities that do not have another organization that's controlling them.

02:29:09.871 --> 02:29:14.594
And that's based on the audit reports that we have for the schools.

02:29:16.135 --> 02:29:21.360
The chartered petitioner may need to speak a little bit more about the different members.

02:29:21.980 --> 02:29:27.785
There's not a lot of information other than what you see in the blue section for Audeo Corporation.

02:29:27.845 --> 02:29:31.148
That is all laid out in their governance structure in the petition.

02:29:31.549 --> 02:29:42.078
But how the interaction is with the other organizations, what we ended up getting from the additional request of documentations is there's a services agreement

02:29:42.578 --> 02:29:51.190
where there's another organization that provides services, sort of like a contract, where they pay for the services and they provide

02:30:03.766 --> 02:30:09.649
Research and Advocacy, Marketing and Licensing, Executive Coaching and Consultancy.

02:30:10.069 --> 02:30:18.814
There's an agreement between Altus Institute, Student Success Programs, and Audeo, and then there was Altus Meris.

02:30:18.894 --> 02:30:29.120
So that's the only other agreement, that's the only other affiliation we see, but this is a, again, a contractual sort of relationship between the organizations where the organizations

02:30:30.321 --> 02:30:34.363
have contracted with the other ones to provide services.

02:30:34.743 --> 02:30:42.629
So, but in terms of the membership, this was more recent and it was based more on this latest request of documentation we received.

02:30:42.689 --> 02:30:48.272
So, not really sure how the members in the other organizations interact with this one.

02:30:48.512 --> 02:30:58.259
But we did see that crossover of the same officers which led us to kind of have a little more robust condition in this item.

02:30:59.940 --> 02:31:05.162
So we know we're asked to approve this with knowing very little about Altus Meris Incorporated.

02:31:05.543 --> 02:31:07.824
I assume that's profit incorporation.

02:31:07.964 --> 02:31:09.645
Usually to me implies profit.

02:31:10.165 --> 02:31:12.806
We don't have any information on that one.

02:31:13.126 --> 02:31:14.487
We couldn't get anything on that one.

02:31:16.229 --> 02:31:30.714
Well, yeah, but it's a problem that we, to me, that, you know, we don't have this, you know, and we've seen people getting compensation across all three of these, which adds up to some pretty significant figures and so on.

02:31:30.734 --> 02:31:40.298
I don't understand why we don't have information on this and board member Williams may want to comment.

02:31:43.559 --> 02:31:44.300
He mistook us.

02:31:51.056 --> 02:31:54.539
So, they are here to present and we can ask all of those questions.

02:31:55.100 --> 02:32:04.390
My understanding is that at least Audeo Charter School Corporation, which is the group that oversees the charter schools,

02:32:05.211 --> 02:32:12.314
that the two we've approved and the one that we're going to consider today is a non-profit public benefit corporation.

02:32:12.434 --> 02:32:14.895
So the word corporation is throwing you off on that.

02:32:15.595 --> 02:32:18.516
I think that's probably true on student success programs.

02:32:19.156 --> 02:32:24.558
I don't know anything about Altus Marist, but that's why we have them here today to answer our questions.

02:32:24.718 --> 02:32:29.760
Yeah, but this should be in the due diligence of the Department of Education.

02:32:30.560 --> 02:32:35.422
I don't think it's a great idea to just have all of this done verbally at these meetings.

02:32:35.863 --> 02:32:38.484
That's why we have a staff to investigate these things.

02:32:39.504 --> 02:32:43.205
I don't understand why that isn't something we could read before we got here.

02:32:43.626 --> 02:32:48.168
And we have to find out about these things through question and answer.

02:32:48.248 --> 02:32:51.469
And then there's allegation and counter-allegation and so on.

02:32:53.107 --> 02:33:04.464
I think given what we've been through, I would ask our liaisons to look into what we need to know about these various interlocking boards.

02:33:05.949 --> 02:33:13.899
And the idea that these, you know, that these are, if I don't see the same people, I've got some questions.

02:33:13.919 --> 02:33:22.989
But when I see the same people, and I've seen that in some other recent charter hearings we've had, that's what troubles me.

02:33:24.051 --> 02:33:33.442
Okay, I will, the liaisons, the charter liaisons will ask for more of that information from CDE and State Board staff if we have that come up again.

02:33:33.462 --> 02:33:41.913
I do know that at the ACCS meeting, all of those, which I observed on archive tape, member,

02:33:42.854 --> 02:33:47.437
holiday was there, all of those questions seemed to be answered satisfactorily.

02:33:48.058 --> 02:33:52.021
And I would, I appreciate your need for more information in advance.

02:33:52.481 --> 02:34:04.930
On the other hand, I'd be careful myself, I'll be careful about carrying over from one set of charter schools concerns to another set without any reason, apparent reason to do so.

02:34:09.657 --> 02:34:18.202
Well, I believe I'm speaking accurately here in that it's my impression that Altus Marist is a for-profit incorporated business.

02:34:19.403 --> 02:34:22.786
It only has... I may be wrong.

02:34:25.327 --> 02:34:34.774
But I believe that the purpose of Altus Marist is to provide these educational services for the various other charter schools.

02:34:36.115 --> 02:34:42.359
But yeah, but evidently, there's some disagreement about whether it's for profit or not.

02:34:42.379 --> 02:34:42.939
We'll find out.

02:34:42.979 --> 02:34:52.265
Yeah, I'm wondering if we shouldn't be getting compensation data on these, you know, people on three different payrolls or whatever is going on.

02:34:52.285 --> 02:35:02.912
You know, those are issues that, again, you know, I'm not trying to carry things over, but I think we need to learn from what

02:35:03.625 --> 02:35:15.476
we have been learning as we go along here and that we, you know, we frankly approved some charter schools that we didn't know enough about, in my view.

02:35:15.556 --> 02:35:27.927
So, and so I'm asking for expanded analysis of these interlocking relationships in that regard.

02:35:27.947 --> 02:35:29.869
And I'm not sure the profit, non-profit is

02:35:30.746 --> 02:35:34.710
the controlling thing as well, but I am interested in that as well.

02:35:35.250 --> 02:35:36.111
Board Member Rucker.

02:35:38.453 --> 02:35:49.102
Okay, so I'm going to begin by saying my reading comprehension skills are quite good and so I know that a Dale Charter School is not celerity, I understand that.

02:35:49.642 --> 02:35:53.826
But if it looks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it's not going to be a chicken.

02:35:54.406 --> 02:36:02.236
So I also am concerned that there are three corporate officers for three different corporations that are the same.

02:36:02.776 --> 02:36:09.024
And I also had questions about exactly what each of these organizations contract for.

02:36:09.524 --> 02:36:14.587
But going beyond that, who makes the decisions about those contracts?

02:36:14.947 --> 02:36:16.327
Who sets those rates?

02:36:16.728 --> 02:36:23.091
And I'm not sure how to say this next question because there is a profit motive in making that decision.

02:36:23.591 --> 02:36:27.333
Because then, who writes the contracts or who sets the agreements?

02:36:27.813 --> 02:36:32.756
Are those agreements... I'm not sure what the correct legal term of art are.

02:36:33.216 --> 02:36:37.478
But are the agreements simply a one-sided agreement where

02:36:38.238 --> 02:36:49.668
because you are part of this large corporate family, I'm telling you this is how much you're going to hand to me for doing these services without consideration about whether that's the fair rate and all those things.

02:36:49.708 --> 02:37:03.260
So, I do have a concern about the fact that there seems to be a common group of folks making some very important fiscal decisions that seem to accrue to the benefit not necessarily of the charter,

02:37:03.740 --> 02:37:04.700
but to the corporation.

02:37:04.740 --> 02:37:06.841
And none of this is very clearly spelled out.

02:37:07.242 --> 02:37:13.504
These are some of the lessons we've learned from previous charters that we didn't know any of this information about.

02:37:13.804 --> 02:37:18.246
But what I heard from the liaison is that these questions were answered.

02:37:18.607 --> 02:37:24.189
So if the questions were answered, I'm kind of hoping somebody will tell me those answers today.

02:37:24.209 --> 02:37:27.631
Okay.

02:37:29.711 --> 02:37:29.992
Yeah.

02:37:32.774 --> 02:37:42.580
Okay, we will have, so we'll open the public hearing and first we'll hear from the people who support the CDE recommendation to approve the charter petition.

02:37:43.020 --> 02:37:43.961
You have 10 minutes.

02:37:48.003 --> 02:37:52.206
Good morning state board members, CDE staff, and Superintendent Torlakson.

02:37:52.226 --> 02:37:53.206
My name is Wade Ashbrenner.

02:37:53.267 --> 02:37:54.247
I'm the lead petitioner.

02:37:54.347 --> 02:38:02.032
I know you're burning to get some answers about the questions that have been posed and I'm going to allow a member of the development team, Christopher Carpenter, to discuss those.

02:38:03.334 --> 02:38:15.362
So, to state for the fact and for the record completely, every organization that is affiliated with these schools are non-profit organizations.

02:38:15.542 --> 02:38:21.466
They are 501c3 tax-exempt organizations that are subject to the California Nonprofit Integrity Act.

02:38:22.286 --> 02:38:22.826
of 2004.

02:38:23.327 --> 02:38:31.449
There are organizations that are subject to reporting standards to the IRS each year, providing Form 990s that are publicly available and that can be reviewed.

02:38:31.769 --> 02:38:39.272
And each has now an independent board that makes and concludes any kind of financial decisions or major financial decisions that are made by a board.

02:38:40.192 --> 02:38:41.353
There are common officers.

02:38:41.453 --> 02:38:42.393
I will point out that Ms.

02:38:42.413 --> 02:38:46.054
Jane Garonski has resigned as secretary of any of these schools.

02:38:46.775 --> 02:38:47.475
Altus Mirus, Inc.

02:38:47.795 --> 02:38:59.400
is a non-profit organization, 501c3 tax-exempt, and operates as simply an organization that operates the Mirus Secondary School, which is authorized by Hispera Unified School District.

02:39:00.020 --> 02:39:12.632
The reason you don't see any information about Hysperia in this petition, in this application, is because it's an organization that is operating in a charter school authorized by Hysperia Unified and is not up on appeal.

02:39:13.233 --> 02:39:24.304
The organization up on appeal and the school is up on appeal is Audeo Charter School, which is also a 501c3 nonprofit organization that has strict requirements regarding spending and things like that, including compensation requirements.

02:39:25.024 --> 02:39:41.027
The Nonprofit Integrity Act of 2004 in California requires that every nonprofit organization with a gross income of over $2 million provide evidence of compensation committees and studies as to compensation of officers and key employees.

02:39:41.487 --> 02:39:48.349
Those compensation studies are presented and provided to the state and often provided to the IRS as well as evidence that the

02:39:49.069 --> 02:39:50.690
compensation is appropriate.

02:39:51.331 --> 02:39:54.773
The compensation is set by an independent board of directors.

02:39:54.953 --> 02:40:06.342
These board of directors consist of business owners, prior educators, other entrepreneurs in the area, members of the military, you'll see Admiral Len Herring,

02:40:07.202 --> 02:40:09.084
on as a keyboard member.

02:40:09.585 --> 02:40:10.566
There are shared officers.

02:40:10.606 --> 02:40:15.210
The shared officers is essentially to keep the operational consistency across organizations.

02:40:16.011 --> 02:40:21.196
One of the reasons, and I'm sure you'll hear from opposition that there's no need for all these different corporations.

02:40:21.296 --> 02:40:22.397
Well, there is.

02:40:22.958 --> 02:40:29.985
One of the reasons you have and set up a different nonprofit corporation, again, when I use the term corporation, I'm referring to a nonprofit

02:40:30.466 --> 02:40:34.776
corporation that is required to submit information about the finances.

02:40:35.197 --> 02:40:37.403
The reason you have these separate organizations is twofold.

02:40:38.004 --> 02:40:38.084
One,

02:40:39.707 --> 02:40:45.749
The structure that is in place now provides a clear view of the entire corporation's operation to each authorizer.

02:40:46.149 --> 02:40:53.130
So, our DO charter school, all of its operations, if Sweetwater Secondary School is approved here, will be viewable by the State Board.

02:40:53.510 --> 02:40:58.832
We also agree to all of conditions and the amendments requested by the State Board or by the staff.

02:40:59.632 --> 02:41:01.172
We fully will comply with all of those.

02:41:01.212 --> 02:41:02.573
We have no issue with it whatsoever.

02:41:02.653 --> 02:41:03.153
We provided

02:41:03.894 --> 02:41:10.923
every piece of information requested by the state office, and we are happy to provide as much as necessary.

02:41:11.023 --> 02:41:13.226
We are not opposed at all to transparency.

02:41:14.368 --> 02:41:20.736
The second reason why you have these separate organizations is essentially to reduce the potential for liability.

02:41:22.018 --> 02:41:25.722
A non-profit corporation helps shield the school in case someone sues them.

02:41:26.563 --> 02:41:36.514
If someone sues, say, Audeo Charter School 2, they can't get the assets of student success programs, or the charter school of San Diego, or a mere secondary school.

02:41:36.574 --> 02:41:41.179
So those schools will not be put in danger because one person decides to sue one of the other schools.

02:41:42.040 --> 02:41:44.803
That's the reason for these different corporations and why they're necessary.

02:41:45.283 --> 02:41:46.464
It's not to hide anything.

02:41:46.504 --> 02:41:52.610
It's not to provide any information or obfuscate the public.

02:41:53.611 --> 02:42:03.319
I also want to make a point to notice that we have, that even Altus Institute, which I'm sure will come up from opponents, was an organization that was previously affiliated.

02:42:03.339 --> 02:42:05.501
There is no more affiliation with that organization.

02:42:05.721 --> 02:42:07.263
All contracts with them have been terminated.

02:42:08.221 --> 02:42:13.646
It was a nonprofit corporation focused on charitable purpose of providing education to students and helping support charter schools.

02:42:15.028 --> 02:42:18.010
But all contracts with them have been terminated.

02:42:18.591 --> 02:42:22.895
There is no money flowing out from any of these schools to Altus Institute whatsoever.

02:42:24.676 --> 02:42:28.119
Lastly, I just want to point out that before I allow

02:42:30.908 --> 02:42:50.238
way to get back into the actual important stuff, which is the students and the educational program that this system provides to a very unique subset of students and the individualized education plan that's working for so many youth, that we have added a parent representative position to all of the boards of each of these organizations.

02:42:51.518 --> 02:42:58.662
For Audeo Charter School, the board there has authorized and approved a parent representative position for them and is actively now recruiting.

02:42:59.402 --> 02:43:00.403
for a parent representative.

02:43:01.164 --> 02:43:10.813
So we are looking and actively seeking out ways to engage more with parents and more with the community and to provide more transparency.

02:43:14.816 --> 02:43:24.565
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Wade so he can go through some of the actual information in the petition itself rather than the questions that have been popped up by

02:43:26.360 --> 02:43:33.702
various org charts put around by different organizations or people that may not have reflected the actual organization.

02:43:34.682 --> 02:43:39.084
President Kirst, was that an answer to your question or was that part of the public hearing?

02:43:39.364 --> 02:43:40.664
That's an answer to the question.

02:43:40.684 --> 02:43:46.386
I think we should start the 10 minutes and not preempt any of their planned presentation.

02:43:46.586 --> 02:43:49.067
So I would begin now on the 10 minutes.

02:43:49.347 --> 02:43:53.668
Let me see if I can... I declare the public hearing open.

02:44:13.556 --> 02:44:14.597
Okay, we'll start at the beginning.

02:44:14.637 --> 02:44:15.918
Again, I'm Wade Ashbrenner.

02:44:16.119 --> 02:44:18.381
I'm the lead petitioner for the Sweetwater Secondary School.

02:44:18.821 --> 02:44:37.160
First of all, I want to thank the CDE staff and the ACCS for their recommendation to approve this petition and also to recognize that it's not just me and Christopher Carpenter up here, but we have 60 members of the Sweetwater School community that are up here to show support for the petition.

02:44:37.800 --> 02:44:54.605
And to give you a little background, it was working with our authorizer, San Diego Unified, that suggested to have the separate non-profits in order to provide further transparency to each of the... They didn't want schools not authorized by them under the non-profit that they authorized.

02:44:54.965 --> 02:44:57.526
So that gives you a little historical perspective on that.

02:44:58.266 --> 02:45:21.796
So in September of 2016, as the final piece of a larger compliance plan for the Charter School of San Diego, we submitted the petition for the resource centers located within the Sweetwater Union High School District so that we could adhere to what we were getting feedback about the Shasta decision as far as the location of resource centers outside a school district's boundary.

02:45:21.836 --> 02:45:24.117
So we did submit prior to the final decision.

02:45:24.577 --> 02:45:35.922
But the Sweetwater Secondary School will be comprised of three resource centers located within the boundaries of the Sweetwater Union High School District, of which the Plaza Bonita Resource Center has been serving families since the 2012-2013 school year.

02:45:40.441 --> 02:45:44.864
You have a diagram here of the IDEO Charter School Corporation.

02:45:45.044 --> 02:45:49.007
It is a nonprofit board and it will govern the Sweetwater Secondary School.

02:45:49.227 --> 02:45:56.613
The board is directly responsible for the success of the charter schools it governs and is within the scope and oversight of the State Board of Education.

02:45:57.193 --> 02:45:57.914
The IDEO board

02:45:58.454 --> 02:46:06.481
further complies with the Brown Act in its meetings, the California Public Records Acts in its documents, and the Political Reform Act in its Conflict of Interest Code.

02:46:06.921 --> 02:46:11.945
In fact, the Conflict of Interest Code was approved by the San Diego County Board of Supervisors.

02:46:13.927 --> 02:46:22.234
For financial stability, the organization has disaggregated our financial data by resource center since the 2012-2013 school year and

02:46:26.155 --> 02:46:29.438
they calculate a net result of operations for each resource center.

02:46:29.478 --> 02:46:42.428
So in March 30th of 2017, Student Success Programs, which is the governing board for the Charter School of San Diego, passed a resolution to transfer the net result of operations for fiscal years 2013-14, 14-15, and 15-16, which

02:46:47.652 --> 02:46:57.578
yields a little more than a million dollars to the Sweetwater Secondary School so that the money will follow the students so that that school can get up off to a great start.

02:46:58.058 --> 02:47:01.140
So a little history about the Charter School of San Diego.

02:47:01.460 --> 02:47:09.044
It was founded in 1994 and its financial and compliance audits have consistently found no exceptions and the school has earned 100% funding under SB 740 for multiple years.

02:47:14.042 --> 02:47:23.605
Working with the San Diego Unified School District, they have issued a letter of good standing that the Charter School of San Diego has met all its financial obligations to its authorizer.

02:47:23.925 --> 02:47:26.625
That letter of good standing was sent to Superintendent Janney.

02:47:27.506 --> 02:47:35.408
Also, the charter petition was submitted to the Sweetwater Union High School District on September 27th of 2016, and we did not have a public hearing until November.

02:47:36.209 --> 02:47:39.032
14th of that year, a full 48 days after submission.

02:47:39.112 --> 02:47:46.521
So we did try to work with the district to have a timely petition process, but it did get quite lengthy.

02:47:47.262 --> 02:47:50.206
And as a top performing alternative school,

02:47:52.463 --> 02:48:04.514
Since 2011 to 2015, we have lowered our dropout rate for students in the South Bay, which has really caused an increase for the demand in our program, thus the addition of resource centers in the South Bay.

02:48:05.095 --> 02:48:11.901
Since opening the Plaza Bonita Resource Center, you can see that there's been a growing student population of students served from the Sweetwater Union High School District.

02:48:12.482 --> 02:48:15.305
The average for the past four years has been about 345 students.

02:48:18.933 --> 02:48:24.836
We use a non-classroom based independent study program, and it's a proven model by the Charter School of San Diego.

02:48:25.197 --> 02:48:27.978
We focus on students' individual strengths, values, and interests.

02:48:28.498 --> 02:48:31.660
Our teachers share a culture of commitment to students and their success.

02:48:32.341 --> 02:48:36.123
We are very proud to have Jeanette Perez as a member of the Charter School of San Diego.

02:48:36.163 --> 02:48:43.267
She was recently named the 2017 California Charter School Teacher of the Year, and we're very proud to have her as a member of our organization.

02:48:43.827 --> 02:48:46.228
In our non-classroom based instructional program,

02:48:47.409 --> 02:48:51.752
Many students find our teachers to be both role model and mentors.

02:48:52.253 --> 02:48:56.095
And we look for teachers who have a passion and commitment to help struggling students.

02:48:58.497 --> 02:49:02.760
Our teachers, we've made a commitment to our teachers and we realize that success starts with them.

02:49:03.260 --> 02:49:08.604
So we compensate them with a salary that's 5% above that of the San Diego Unified School District.

02:49:09.145 --> 02:49:16.190
We provide 100% employer paid benefits to the employee and to all eligible employee dependents.

02:49:17.074 --> 02:49:24.530
Over the past three years, our teacher retention rate has been over 90%, and 60% of our teachers have been with us more than six years.

02:49:25.629 --> 02:49:30.294
We have a tremendous relationship for professional development with the San Diego County Office of Education.

02:49:30.354 --> 02:49:38.282
And in the past two years, our teachers have attended over 7,000 hours of training from the Leadership and Learning Division of San Diego County Office of Education.

02:49:38.802 --> 02:49:42.506
We also have internal professional development where we grow future leaders.

02:49:42.546 --> 02:49:49.232
So many of the people, including myself, have worked their way up through the ranks of the Charter School of San Diego into leadership positions.

02:49:49.913 --> 02:49:56.037
To date, 87 teachers have received their Leading Edge certification as a result of our partnership with the San Diego County Office of Ed.

02:49:56.538 --> 02:50:02.242
Leading Edge certification is a national certification program in educational technology and curriculum innovation.

02:50:03.240 --> 02:50:07.442
But at the heart of our program is our students and transforming lives is our mission.

02:50:07.563 --> 02:50:11.865
We've designed a rigorous academic curriculum to prepare students for life after high school.

02:50:12.505 --> 02:50:23.252
Students, parents and staff collaborate to create a personalized academic plan to complete their high school and transition to perhaps a four-year university or community college or enter directly into their career.

02:50:24.092 --> 02:50:31.675
Student demographic trends indicate that about 65% of our students in middle and high school come to us credit deficient by more than one semester.

02:50:31.775 --> 02:50:41.399
So I know yesterday you talked about alternative assessment measures for those schools, so I commend you that programs like ours do need some alternative metrics to prove their success.

02:50:42.579 --> 02:50:45.262
70% of our students are socioeconomically disadvantaged.

02:50:45.282 --> 02:50:48.665
84% represent minority student populations.

02:50:49.165 --> 02:50:54.410
Additionally, approximately 19% of our students currently qualify for special education support.

02:50:54.870 --> 02:50:59.615
And overall, for the Charter School of San Diego, 15% of our students are English language learners.

02:51:01.974 --> 02:51:05.375
We designed a program of pathways to achieve student success.

02:51:05.755 --> 02:51:15.577
The data that we collect shows that when teachers and students have one-on-one support, that students develop a confidence in their abilities, leading them to personal successes few had had before.

02:51:16.057 --> 02:51:27.159
The focus of the Sweetwater Secondary School will be to improve student learning, offer a safe learning environment, and provide a highly qualified faculty and staff to an often high-risk student population.

02:51:27.839 --> 02:51:34.643
Over the past five years alone, the Charter School of San Diego has had more than 3,000 students complete their high school requirements.

02:51:35.624 --> 02:51:36.705
A big part of our program

02:51:38.109 --> 02:51:40.610
is our ELD program or English Language Development.

02:51:40.910 --> 02:51:44.392
The Sweetwater Secondary School will offer a comprehensive ELD program.

02:51:44.832 --> 02:51:57.817
The integrated portion of the program is designed to ensure that our English learners can access the core curriculum, build the literacy skills that they need to engage in a rigorous course of study that is aligned to California Common Core standards.

02:51:58.417 --> 02:52:01.339
All courses are customized and based on the student's skill level and interests.

02:52:01.479 --> 02:52:04.580
Curriculum is scaffolded and language supports are embedded in each course.

02:52:05.916 --> 02:52:09.738
Teachers are trained on research-based engagement strategies, including SDI.

02:52:11.638 --> 02:52:13.439
We have a nationally recognized program.

02:52:14.139 --> 02:52:17.681
The Charter School of San Diego is one of the oldest charter schools in operation.

02:52:17.741 --> 02:52:18.341
It was founded in 1994.

02:52:18.401 --> 02:52:20.482
We were fortunate in 2015 that we were awarded

02:52:24.051 --> 02:52:26.753
the Malcolm Baldrige National Equality Award.

02:52:27.253 --> 02:52:34.018
Under President Obama, it's the nation's highest presidential honor for performance excellence through innovation, improvement, and visionary leadership.

02:52:34.558 --> 02:52:42.203
This was the first time that the award was presented to a single school, much less than a charter school in the Baldrige Award's 29-year history.

02:52:43.584 --> 02:52:44.085
Sorry, that was a...

02:52:46.570 --> 02:52:47.651
Some of our accomplishments.

02:52:48.092 --> 02:52:59.142
Just two weeks ago, we were notified by WASC that the Charter School of San Diego was awarded a six-year clear WASC accreditation term and has comprehensive course lists approved by both the University of California and the NCAA.

02:52:59.603 --> 02:53:06.930
The school was able to achieve the 23rd highest API score while it was under its ASAM designation out of approximately 850 alternative schools.

02:53:09.493 --> 02:53:16.519
We take great pride in the fact that we just had recently had 394 students take part in graduation in Balboa Park down in San Diego.

02:53:16.539 --> 02:53:20.942
It's a beautiful setting and I invite everyone on the board to come down and join us for graduation next year.

02:53:22.664 --> 02:53:34.493
And finally, to the more than 300 students who signed our online petition, additionally I have two of these containers of postcards for over a thousand parents.

02:53:36.001 --> 02:53:40.403
who have supported the school throughout its duration.

02:53:40.803 --> 02:53:56.250
We're just happy to have a community that supports us and agrees that there needs to be public school options for some of the most disadvantaged students in the community, gives them an opportunity to re-engage with their studies, have a safe school environment, and have a personalized education plan.

02:53:56.710 --> 02:54:02.933
I know you take great care when rendering a decision, and I urge you to recommend this charter school petition for approval.

02:54:03.153 --> 02:54:03.753
Thank you very much.

02:54:08.780 --> 02:54:09.600
Do we have any more time?

02:54:10.520 --> 02:54:11.561
I just wanted to make one.

02:54:11.581 --> 02:54:13.661
I still have some time?

02:54:14.361 --> 02:54:14.821
OK, great.

02:54:15.822 --> 02:54:22.023
Again, I wanted to express my appreciation to Superintendents Torlakson and Board President Kurz, the rest of the board members for hearing this.

02:54:22.083 --> 02:54:25.964
This is the last one of these petitions of this school to come up before you.

02:54:26.384 --> 02:54:33.266
You have authorized already ACS2, Audio Charter School 2, and Grossmont Secondary School petitions that have come before you.

02:54:33.386 --> 02:54:36.227
And as this is the same model of program,

02:54:38.208 --> 02:54:48.596
you know, it's already been determined that the program is educationally sound and meets the requirements of Education Code section 47605B.

02:54:49.176 --> 02:54:51.298
So we do hope that you approve this petition.

02:54:51.318 --> 02:54:58.744
If there are any questions regarding any of the makeup or things like that that may come up later on, I'm happy to answer those questions and we look forward to your vote.

02:54:58.764 --> 02:54:59.044
Thank you.

02:55:00.734 --> 02:55:07.792
Okay, now the opponents of the charter petition and CDE recommendation, please come forward.

02:55:07.832 --> 02:55:09.015
You will have 10 minutes.

02:55:15.650 --> 02:55:17.131
Good morning, board members.

02:55:17.312 --> 02:55:19.834
It's my pleasure to be in front of you this morning.

02:55:20.434 --> 02:55:26.199
With me here today is Dr. Joe Falcher, who is the Assistant Super Equity, Culture and Support Services for Sweetwater Union High School District.

02:55:26.979 --> 02:55:32.424
Gene Shavira, who is the CTA president representing classified and certificated staff.

02:55:34.741 --> 02:55:37.382
And also Jenny Carbuccia, who is a general counsel for Sweetwater.

02:55:38.022 --> 02:55:39.163
My name is Sarah Sutherland.

02:55:39.223 --> 02:55:43.064
I represented Sweetwater Union High School District in consideration of this petition.

02:55:43.924 --> 02:55:49.387
This is not a new charter school being proposed to you for any of the enumerated reasons in the Charter Schools Act.

02:55:49.887 --> 02:56:03.092
It is a corporate expansion effort to generate more revenue and profit for the corporate executives who are making quite a substantial profit off this endeavor by duplicating identical programs and avoiding transparency.

02:56:04.012 --> 02:56:08.135
and the sound fiscal practices that are required when spending public tax dollars on public education.

02:56:08.895 --> 02:56:11.196
Petitioners have not been cooperative at the local level.

02:56:11.617 --> 02:56:17.200
All of the information that was provided to you about all these various corporations were not provided or mentioned in the petition.

02:56:17.220 --> 02:56:18.521
I think that's very significant.

02:56:18.941 --> 02:56:31.649
This issue is now before you and has become the main issue because we did our research in considering the petition and knew that this wasn't just one school being started, but a part of a vast network of interrelated contracts, common boards, and common executives.

02:56:33.910 --> 02:56:36.652
The CDE proposes technical amendments and conditions.

02:56:37.212 --> 02:56:39.113
They are not technical amendments and conditions.

02:56:39.193 --> 02:56:45.337
They are proposals to remedy flaws in the charter petition that form the basis for denial at the local level.

02:56:45.818 --> 02:56:47.118
These are not technical amendments.

02:56:47.158 --> 02:56:50.581
These are adding people to the board, changing corporate descriptions.

02:56:51.041 --> 02:56:55.824
This is a very different petition that we're talking about today than it was in October when the Sweetwater board first looked at this.

02:57:02.037 --> 02:57:10.804
The petition is not transparent, nor is the operations of this organization that has multiple layers of corporations that are all related and affiliated and contract with one another.

02:57:11.485 --> 02:57:21.433
The petition does not disclose the Greater Altus Network or how the school is governed overall, who is making the decisions, with what profit, with what motives in mind, where they're meeting.

02:57:21.553 --> 02:57:24.675
It explains how this impacts your oversight, what happens if

02:57:26.057 --> 02:57:31.062
$500,000 or $1 million or $1.5 million is transferred from this school to another expansion effort.

02:57:31.102 --> 02:57:33.084
Do you all get to oversee that or not?

02:57:33.264 --> 02:57:33.804
It's unclear.

02:57:34.625 --> 02:57:38.589
The petition failed to mention the simultaneous application to Groshmont.

02:57:38.709 --> 02:57:40.211
It would be served by the same governing board.

02:57:40.251 --> 02:57:44.475
The petition had identical language, yet CDE's findings and conditions are different.

02:57:45.416 --> 02:57:46.657
at your very next board meeting.

02:57:47.457 --> 02:57:50.979
The petition proposes a new program specifically tailored to Sweetwater community.

02:57:51.099 --> 02:57:59.825
The petition was identical to the petition for Audeo II, Grosmont Secondary School, and other Altus schools, showing that it's really more of a franchise of an existing product.

02:57:59.885 --> 02:58:04.247
It's not a plan developed for the Sweetwater community with the Sweetwater community's needs in mind.

02:58:04.327 --> 02:58:09.270
Sweetwater is a much different community than Grosmont, than San Diego, and has different

02:58:11.011 --> 02:58:12.872
considerations and they don't have a parent on the board.

02:58:12.912 --> 02:58:14.373
They're still not entitled to a parent on the board.

02:58:14.393 --> 02:58:16.815
That's a condition you all put on the Grossmont Secondary School.

02:58:17.636 --> 02:58:22.759
And so while I'm glad to see that's now happening, that was not something that was proposed to the Sweetwater Board.

02:58:23.139 --> 02:58:25.561
That was not something that was being considered at the local level.

02:58:25.941 --> 02:58:31.545
That was one of the basis for denial at the local level was the lack of participation of the local community in this charter school.

02:58:32.526 --> 02:58:35.949
There is also a huge problem with conflicts of interest and excessive pay.

02:58:36.350 --> 02:58:40.094
There's been a lot of dialogue about for-profit versus non-profit corporations.

02:58:40.194 --> 02:58:43.037
Non-profit corporations still pay their executives a lot of money.

02:58:43.518 --> 02:58:46.401
It just means the corporation doesn't have a profit that it pays.

02:58:47.102 --> 02:58:54.086
And so all charter schools in this vast network, including the Altus Marist, are run centrally, but it's not written that way.

02:58:54.566 --> 02:58:56.748
They don't exist under the oversight of anyone.

02:58:56.948 --> 02:59:01.911
Each of the little corporations under the big corporation is overseen by individual agencies.

02:59:02.351 --> 02:59:08.675
This can be seen by the fact that executive employees are paid disproportionately gross salaries in comparison to what they're doing.

02:59:09.195 --> 02:59:12.537
According to the Altus tax records, Mary Bixby earned a salary of $371,160 in 2015.

02:59:16.519 --> 02:59:18.820
That was to serve 3,000 kids in independent study.

02:59:18.840 --> 02:59:18.820
$371,000.

02:59:19.641 --> 02:59:22.062
That was not disclosed.

02:59:22.102 --> 02:59:23.222
That was not said publicly.

02:59:23.663 --> 02:59:24.703
That's not in your materials.

02:59:25.664 --> 02:59:28.725
That is higher than nearly all district superintendents in the entire state.

02:59:29.846 --> 02:59:30.086
That was 2015.

02:59:30.406 --> 02:59:31.727
I suspect it's higher now.

02:59:32.447 --> 02:59:37.370
They need to keep growing to increase and keep corporate salaries at that level.

02:59:37.870 --> 02:59:39.631
This is not what public educators get paid.

02:59:41.216 --> 02:59:48.881
Academic performance, I will allow others to speak to that, but suffice it to say, it is not what they indicate that it is.

02:59:48.941 --> 02:59:53.204
And Sweetwater schools, same type of students, are consistently outperforming these resource centers.

02:59:54.811 --> 03:00:01.896
Lastly, I already mentioned this, but the lack of parent involvement is very, very significant because it is unclear which board is making decisions and where they're meeting.

03:00:01.956 --> 03:00:05.199
And every one of these boards has common members and common executives.

03:00:05.379 --> 03:00:12.064
And so there is substantial, they are not arm's length transactions, as Member Rucker was referring to earlier.

03:00:12.124 --> 03:00:23.492
They are two people on the same side deciding we'll transfer 10% of this revenue to provide consulting and some of those other services that were listed that really have nothing to do with educating kids and have to do with expanding a corporation.

03:00:28.598 --> 03:00:29.638
My name is Joe Fulcher.

03:00:29.698 --> 03:00:34.600
I'm the Assistant Superintendent of Equity, Culture, and Support Services for the Sweetwater School District.

03:00:35.640 --> 03:00:38.260
I've had a 25-year educational career.

03:00:38.520 --> 03:00:48.023
I've been a teacher assistant, worked in a children's center, teacher, school counselor, school psychologist, principal, director of special ed.

03:00:48.919 --> 03:00:52.142
been a Chief Student Services Officer and now an Assistant Superintendent.

03:00:52.543 --> 03:01:00.210
And I mention my history because I've had a long career of championing and implementing very effective programs.

03:01:00.230 --> 03:01:08.258
I have a strong track record of putting programs that have served students across this state

03:01:09.595 --> 03:01:17.658
and take issue with the fact that someone recommended approval of this because it's a sound program, a sound educational program.

03:01:18.459 --> 03:01:26.602
I know it's extremely rare for school board members to go against the recommendation of their staff, but in this case, I think it makes sense.

03:01:27.582 --> 03:01:31.484
This charter and petition lacks in several ways.

03:01:32.064 --> 03:01:34.725
Some you've heard about already and others I'll briefly mention.

03:01:36.095 --> 03:01:39.179
Our district, the Sweetwater School District, was found in 1920.

03:01:41.701 --> 03:01:44.024
We are on the border, the international border.

03:01:44.044 --> 03:01:49.630
We serve almost 80% of our students, rather, are Latino.

03:01:50.491 --> 03:01:55.957
The next largest population are Asian students, followed by white and African American.

03:01:57.838 --> 03:02:04.402
Many of the staff in our district, 80% of the staff in our district attended school in Sweetwater.

03:02:04.442 --> 03:02:07.243
It's a strong, viable community.

03:02:08.704 --> 03:02:16.809
The academic performance that you heard about from Altus does not replicate what we do for the students in our district.

03:02:17.610 --> 03:02:22.853
Their academic performance is a little lower than the students we serve across the board.

03:02:24.034 --> 03:02:25.255
Their graduation rate

03:02:25.854 --> 03:02:28.336
It's lower and their dropout rate is higher.

03:02:28.857 --> 03:02:38.186
So we think our program is a substantial improvement to what you've heard about or read about in some of the documents you've received.

03:02:39.006 --> 03:02:43.651
They talked about a plan for their students with English, who are English learners.

03:02:44.787 --> 03:02:51.194
If you look deep and dig deeper into that plan, you'll see there's a lack of coherence.

03:02:51.975 --> 03:02:53.817
It's not really a plan at all.

03:02:53.977 --> 03:03:01.264
We have a long track record in Sweetwater of serving students, all students, but especially students who are learning English.

03:03:02.365 --> 03:03:07.411
Over 50% of our students are in that category as of this year.

03:03:09.554 --> 03:03:14.656
Their education program, which they mentioned a few times, lacks rigor, in our opinion.

03:03:14.756 --> 03:03:21.519
And we say this after considerable research and investigation into their program.

03:03:22.100 --> 03:03:25.381
It won't necessarily increase or improve the academic achievement.

03:03:26.242 --> 03:03:31.424
And it's modeled after other programs with different populations of students served.

03:03:32.520 --> 03:03:41.405
the participation AP classes and A through G courses is much lower than what we offer the students in our district.

03:03:43.046 --> 03:03:52.952
So I would sit here and actually commit to serving and supporting this program if I thought it would make a substantial difference for the students in our district.

03:03:53.612 --> 03:03:54.413
I don't think it will.

03:03:55.433 --> 03:03:58.395
And I'm recommending you reject this petition.

03:04:03.914 --> 03:04:04.655
Blue Board members.

03:04:05.376 --> 03:04:16.407
I'm Gene Shavira, a special education teacher, president of the Sweetwater Education Association, and a lifelong resident of the Sweetwater Union High School district and graduate, proud graduate.

03:04:16.987 --> 03:04:25.696
I'm here today as a representative of the teachers and all of the Sweetwater CSEA members to urge you to deny Sweetwater Secondary Schools' petition for charter.

03:04:26.517 --> 03:04:36.351
As a special education teacher, I have concerns on the impact that Sweetwater Secondary School have on special education programs at the Sweetwater Union High School District.

03:04:36.992 --> 03:04:42.820
When corporate charter schools siphon general ed students from public schools, they impact the ratios of

03:04:43.660 --> 03:04:47.002
special ed to general ed students in public schools.

03:04:47.582 --> 03:04:59.987
Because of the unique social economic status of Sweetwater Union High School District, it has a high percentage of special ed students and recently received a letter from the state to try to lower the number.

03:05:02.248 --> 03:05:08.631
when special education students are accepted, they are often not served properly.

03:05:09.432 --> 03:05:28.762
A recent case within the Altus Charter School, the parent company of the Sweetwater Secondary Schools, $47,000 in unknown attorney fees were awarded to a special education student for their failure to be placed in appropriate educational setting as required by federal law.

03:05:31.048 --> 03:05:34.023
I urge you again to deny the petition.

03:05:37.530 --> 03:05:51.481
I know it's done but our assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez who represents the entire district has also submitted a letter of opposition that was going to be read to you that talks about the issues that she has related to transparency.

03:05:51.701 --> 03:05:53.022
Thank you.

03:05:53.442 --> 03:05:53.903
Okay.

03:05:54.043 --> 03:06:01.108
I now declare the public hearing closed and ready for initial comments by board members and questions.

03:06:02.950 --> 03:06:03.250
We could...

03:06:04.070 --> 03:06:07.472
We could also proceed directly to public comment if people want to.

03:06:10.594 --> 03:06:14.515
Do either the liaisons want to comment now or should we go to public comment?

03:06:14.535 --> 03:06:18.177
I know Board Member Rucker wants to comment, but I want to give the liaisons first shot.

03:06:19.758 --> 03:06:21.099
Okay, Board Member Rucker.

03:06:23.120 --> 03:06:24.040
Yeah, okay.

03:06:25.201 --> 03:06:27.642
All right, let's call a roll on the public comment.

03:06:30.779 --> 03:06:32.500
Would the following people please line up?

03:06:32.800 --> 03:06:45.206
Sarah Sutherland, Joni Carbuena, Stephanie Starr, Sue Fuller, Daisy Rodriguez, Dave Goyette, Javier Alonso, Becky Diaz,

03:06:47.037 --> 03:07:06.621
Sebastian Salgado, Cameron Walton, Arlene McGowan, Esteban Salgado, Jeanette Perez, Satupu Sagano, Jean Chirira, Michelle Lynch, David Cortez, Lorraine Richards, and Eric Primack.

03:07:16.004 --> 03:07:18.045
Hello, my name is Stephanie Starr.

03:07:18.065 --> 03:07:24.070
I'm the Special Instructional Services Coordinator and member of the development team for Sweetwater Charter School.

03:07:24.450 --> 03:07:27.692
I'd like to tell you a little bit about some of our student subgroups.

03:07:28.353 --> 03:07:37.819
We excel at serving students with disabilities and English learners because we tailor our instructional program to the unique needs of each and every student.

03:07:38.299 --> 03:07:44.504
Our program design allows us to truly customize teaching and learning, and it's really exciting work.

03:07:46.306 --> 03:07:50.450
We currently serve a 15% English learner population.

03:07:50.650 --> 03:07:55.175
These are students that enroll with us at ages 16 and older.

03:07:55.595 --> 03:08:00.460
They're already classified as English learners, and they're at high risk of becoming long-term.

03:08:00.781 --> 03:08:06.947
We have a proven, demonstrated success with moving these students towards English proficiency and reclassification.

03:08:07.848 --> 03:08:10.670
We also have a 19% special education population.

03:08:11.451 --> 03:08:14.693
Again, these are students that enroll older and have already been identified.

03:08:14.893 --> 03:08:19.076
And to serve them, we will become a part of the El Dorado County Charter SELPA.

03:08:19.777 --> 03:08:20.157
Thank you.

03:08:20.237 --> 03:08:21.198
Please support our petition.

03:08:30.148 --> 03:08:36.632
Hello, my name is Susan Fuller, the grandmother and guardian of Cameron Fuller, a senior at the Charter School of San Diego.

03:08:37.452 --> 03:08:46.138
CSSD's staff and services have changed the direction of Cameron's educational experience from hopeless to being able to see the light at the end of the tunnel.

03:08:46.938 --> 03:08:51.262
At her previous school, it became clear during eighth grade we needed guidance as a family.

03:08:52.063 --> 03:08:59.510
The school was just too large for Cameron, and after two years of IEPs, counselor assistance, she was exhausted and made little progress.

03:08:59.991 --> 03:09:10.581
In 11th grade, Cameron enrolled at CSSD, where we discovered a feeling of partnership, genuine concern for her future, and a willingness to help her with her unique needs.

03:09:11.281 --> 03:09:18.405
Our granddaughter's goal with the continued support of her teachers is to attend City College and enroll in their cosmetology program.

03:09:18.886 --> 03:09:26.030
Thanks to CSSD, the dedicated teachers, and their specialized programs, Cameron's true potential has been unlocked.

03:09:26.350 --> 03:09:28.311
Please vote to approve Sweetwater's charter.

03:09:28.852 --> 03:09:29.172
Thank you.

03:09:34.656 --> 03:09:36.737
Hello, my name is Daisy Rodriguez.

03:09:36.937 --> 03:09:41.218
I'm currently a student enrolled at CSSD and soon to be graduate.

03:09:41.938 --> 03:09:50.981
Ever since I began attending the Charter School of San Diego, it has given me the opportunity to become a more independent individual and to interact more with my instructors.

03:09:51.842 --> 03:09:58.424
They are very attentive when needed, are always open to working with my schedule, and keep me focused on my work.

03:09:59.524 --> 03:10:04.805
At first, I didn't believe I could take on independent studies because of the lack of determination.

03:10:05.546 --> 03:10:11.487
Fortunately, my instructor was very encouraging and I gained a lot of confidence in myself.

03:10:12.328 --> 03:10:15.468
The help given has been very beneficial and convenient for me.

03:10:15.968 --> 03:10:21.030
The lessons are very clear, understandable, and I have noticed a big difference in my grades.

03:10:21.883 --> 03:10:27.680
I ask for you to please approve this petition so that other students can get on the path to success as well.

03:10:28.442 --> 03:10:29.224
Thank you for your time.

03:10:35.233 --> 03:10:36.534
Hello, my name is David Goyette.

03:10:36.714 --> 03:10:42.979
I'm a teacher with the Charter School of San Diego, and I'm proud to speak to you today in support of the Sweetwater Secondary Petition.

03:10:43.599 --> 03:10:51.285
In my 18 years as a teacher, I've seen firsthand how some traditional schools and charter schools struggle to support their instructional staff and students.

03:10:52.025 --> 03:11:00.371
By contrast, our CSSD support staff and professional development team ensure that our teachers have all the tools and training to guide their students towards success.

03:11:01.332 --> 03:11:06.514
CSSD teachers are compensated 5% above the local district's pay scale.

03:11:06.774 --> 03:11:15.037
Our generous benefits package gives our teachers and families peace of mind and our classrooms are well equipped with the latest technology and materials.

03:11:15.537 --> 03:11:16.738
As a teacher who began

03:11:17.538 --> 03:11:25.802
As a classroom assistant with the program and served as a teacher representative on our school's board of directors, I can attest to the robust support our teachers receive every day.

03:11:26.482 --> 03:11:31.264
I'm thankful to be part of an organization that honors its teachers so we can put our students first.

03:11:31.724 --> 03:11:32.445
Please vote to approve.

03:11:32.585 --> 03:11:32.845
Thank you.

03:11:37.864 --> 03:11:38.585
Good afternoon, everyone.

03:11:38.605 --> 03:11:41.767
My name is Javier Alonzo, and I am a graduate of the Charter School of San Diego.

03:11:42.287 --> 03:11:44.789
My experience with this program was nothing short of amazing.

03:11:45.270 --> 03:11:48.632
At the Charter School of San Diego, I was inspired by the adaptive learning environment.

03:11:48.672 --> 03:11:52.235
And for the first time in my life, I actually looked forward to waking up and going to school.

03:11:53.136 --> 03:11:59.640
This school welcomed me with open arms, and I had teachers there that showed me that they wanted all their students to be there and succeed beyond their dreams.

03:12:00.635 --> 03:12:06.939
Like all students, myself, there was a time where I got a lack of motivation and a lot of work left, and I didn't want to do anything.

03:12:06.979 --> 03:12:12.202
But with this school's help and passion, I was able to make the deadline to graduate with them in their recent ceremony.

03:12:13.263 --> 03:12:19.127
Simply to put it, it is a flexible program that has incredible teachers that make it a life-changing experience for me and all students.

03:12:19.907 --> 03:12:22.989
It is simply, really, the greatest experience of my life.

03:12:23.750 --> 03:12:28.413
And I would recommend this program to any student that needs something different, a different learning environment to their own pace.

03:12:29.295 --> 03:12:30.956
Please approve the Sweetwater Secondary School.

03:12:31.036 --> 03:12:32.458
We won't let you down, I promise.

03:12:32.478 --> 03:12:32.938
Thank you.

03:12:38.543 --> 03:12:49.952
Hello, my name is Rebecca Diaz, and I've grown up and raised my own family in the Sweetwater community, specifically in the East Lake Bonita area, where many of my students and families come from.

03:12:50.653 --> 03:12:57.538
I've been fortunate enough to teach at the Charter School of San Diego for the past nine years, and I feel very privileged to speak to you today.

03:12:58.439 --> 03:13:02.581
I witnessed the many successes of our students who come to us for different reasons.

03:13:03.162 --> 03:13:09.746
For example, some students attend our school because they're behind on credits or they're below grade level in reading and math.

03:13:10.306 --> 03:13:19.832
And we offer them a personalized, individualized approach to learning that includes working on one course at a time and one-on-one and in small group settings.

03:13:20.672 --> 03:13:26.015
Because of the low student to teacher ratio, I am able to build a personal rapport with my students.

03:13:26.516 --> 03:13:31.459
And this provides them with a sense of security and belonging, which leads to greater learning outcomes.

03:13:32.039 --> 03:13:39.203
It also allows us to foster students who will one day be active citizens and future leaders within the Sweetwater community.

03:13:39.844 --> 03:13:43.086
I urge you to approve the Sweetwater Secondary Schools Charter.

03:13:43.286 --> 03:13:43.606
Thank you.

03:13:50.506 --> 03:13:55.289
Hello, my name is Sebastian Salgado and I attended the Charter School of San Diego from which I proudly graduated.

03:13:55.689 --> 03:14:00.311
In traditional high school, due to my unique learning style, I struggled having new teachers with each subject.

03:14:00.752 --> 03:14:03.493
Their teaching styles and approaches often made it pretty difficult for me.

03:14:04.073 --> 03:14:08.636
Ultimately, I found it hard to build a solid relationship with them, which hindered my academic progress.

03:14:09.196 --> 03:14:14.183
The Charter School of San Diego was a much better option for me because I had one teacher at a time.

03:14:14.563 --> 03:14:17.286
And with that, as a result, they got to know my learning style.

03:14:17.767 --> 03:14:21.632
It was very easy for me to adapt to this program, and I benefited from its flexibility.

03:14:22.153 --> 03:14:27.439
It also helped that I encountered peers who were a positive influence on me compared to others who had a negative influence on me.

03:14:28.501 --> 03:14:29.523
Now, I'm doing great.

03:14:29.703 --> 03:14:31.246
I'm attending a local community college.

03:14:31.386 --> 03:14:32.869
I'm working and I do volunteer work.

03:14:33.310 --> 03:14:38.841
I hope that you please approve the Sweetwater Secondary School petitions so that the students can get to the path as well.

03:14:39.081 --> 03:14:39.362
Thank you.

03:14:45.319 --> 03:14:49.183
Hello, my name is Cameron Walton and I'm a graduate from the Charter School of San Diego.

03:14:49.464 --> 03:14:55.971
I came to the Charter School of San Diego because I wanted to go to a school where I could work at my own pace and create a structure of learning that worked for me.

03:14:56.331 --> 03:14:59.635
The Charter School of San Diego also allowed me more time to spend with my family.

03:15:00.461 --> 03:15:04.723
which I needed to do due to severe health problems my dad was experiencing the past year.

03:15:05.223 --> 03:15:14.587
The Charter School of San Diego gave me the opportunity to have a flexible schedule, be there with my dad, and worked very closely with me to make sure my life and family needs were being met while still succeeding in school.

03:15:15.267 --> 03:15:19.349
At the Charter School of San Diego, I did outstanding compared to how I did at my previous school.

03:15:19.989 --> 03:15:23.150
I went from getting C's to straight A's at the Charter School of San Diego.

03:15:23.571 --> 03:15:26.292
The improvement in my grades opened up many doors for my future.

03:15:26.672 --> 03:15:33.035
The Charter School of San Diego also helped in preparing me for college by having me create my college plan and a whole college presentation.

03:15:33.855 --> 03:15:38.797
I'm going to attend San Diego Mesa Community College, and I hope to become an automotive mechanic.

03:15:39.157 --> 03:15:44.439
Please approve Sweetwater's charter, which will help give more students like me the opportunity to thrive in school and plan for the future.

03:15:44.760 --> 03:15:45.380
Thank you very much.

03:15:51.001 --> 03:15:51.922
Good afternoon.

03:15:51.962 --> 03:15:59.248
My name is Arlene McGowan, and I am the data and assessment coordinator and also a member of the development team for Sweetwater Secondary School.

03:15:59.788 --> 03:16:15.601
First, I would like to thank the CDE staff for the work they've done in support of alternative educational settings and the board's unanimous approval yesterday on the eligibility criteria for schools that serve unique student populations like ours.

03:16:16.401 --> 03:16:31.928
As an alternative schools accountability model school, in comparing with similar ACM schools in the Sweetwater Union High School District, we do outperform those schools in dropout rates, graduation rates, smarter balance assessment.

03:16:32.748 --> 03:16:38.629
Results in English Language Arts and Math in both school-wide results and special student groups.

03:16:39.370 --> 03:16:42.390
And then also our English learners' performance on this CELT.

03:16:42.830 --> 03:16:48.192
We do have that comparable data here, and we can make it available upon request.

03:16:48.972 --> 03:16:53.093
We ask you to please approve our Sweetwater secondary school petition.

03:16:53.453 --> 03:16:53.773
Thank you.

03:17:01.914 --> 03:17:02.494
Good afternoon.

03:17:02.814 --> 03:17:09.858
My name is Estel Salgado, and I am a student at the Charter School of San Diego, and I'm speaking today in favor of the Sweetwater Secondary School petition.

03:17:10.978 --> 03:17:20.683
Starting in elementary school, I tried to focus on my academic work, but many of my classmates were already getting into trouble, which I found easily distracting.

03:17:21.687 --> 03:17:29.291
Since I wanted to direct my attention towards school and stay away from the negative influences, I enrolled in the Charter School of San Diego.

03:17:30.032 --> 03:17:31.652
Here, I'm thriving.

03:17:32.473 --> 03:17:37.216
I'm doing very well academically and can focus all of my attention on my studies.

03:17:37.596 --> 03:17:41.298
I'm getting ahead in all my classes and I have all A's and B's.

03:17:42.520 --> 03:17:52.905
The big difference I have found in this program helps me to stay on track and learn at my own pace, which I find really supportive and helps me to understand the material.

03:17:53.786 --> 03:17:59.169
I ask that you please approve of this petition so that other students may benefit from this program as well.

03:17:59.569 --> 03:17:59.869
Thank you.

03:18:06.189 --> 03:18:13.175
Hello, my name is Jeanette Perez and I've just started my 24th year at the Charter School of San Diego as a teacher.

03:18:14.056 --> 03:18:22.322
I've seen firsthand the opportunities that our school offers students so they can be successful, productive citizens.

03:18:23.624 --> 03:18:29.025
In June, many of my students became the first to graduate in their family.

03:18:30.086 --> 03:18:33.347
This has been the case for hundreds of my students.

03:18:34.647 --> 03:18:40.849
Another student who has been homeless for most of her life just earned her high school diploma.

03:18:42.249 --> 03:18:49.211
Unfortunately, this type of situation is not outside the norm for our student population.

03:18:50.424 --> 03:19:01.050
The design, resources, and special training we are provided at CSSD allows us to meet these students' needs and move them forward.

03:19:02.490 --> 03:19:09.934
In fact, in March, I was honored to receive the 2017 Hart Dungeon Award.

03:19:10.395 --> 03:19:12.136
Please support the Grossmont Charter.

03:19:12.236 --> 03:19:12.576
Thank you.

03:19:19.670 --> 03:19:20.211
Good afternoon.

03:19:20.571 --> 03:19:24.658
My name is Saitupu L. Sangyal and I am a proud graduate of the Charter School of San Diego.

03:19:25.820 --> 03:19:33.271
I've attended the Charter School of San Diego since the sixth grade due to the fact that I was an extremely shy kid and my mom wanted me to go to a safer alternative for school.

03:19:34.465 --> 03:19:37.046
But the Charter School of San Diego didn't just benefit my safety.

03:19:37.646 --> 03:19:40.006
It also gave me the opportunity to gain leadership skills.

03:19:40.847 --> 03:19:46.448
I participated in the California Cadet Corps, where I was able to push myself outside of my comfort zone and grow as a leader.

03:19:47.208 --> 03:19:53.410
I even competed in a statewide academic competition and won first place, earning the highest competitive award in the program.

03:19:54.290 --> 03:19:58.171
Without the Charter School of San Diego, my accomplishments wouldn't have been possible.

03:19:58.931 --> 03:20:03.213
The teachers understand that not all children learn the same way or go through the same things.

03:20:04.113 --> 03:20:08.195
Though it may not seem like it at times, we as kids appreciate this more than anything else.

03:20:09.216 --> 03:20:13.557
The Charter School of San Diego has been a door opener for many kids and the last door opened for some.

03:20:14.398 --> 03:20:20.721
Please approve the Sweetwater Secondary Schools Charter so that the children in this community are able to grow and succeed no matter what obstacles they face.

03:20:21.101 --> 03:20:21.401
Thank you.

03:20:27.671 --> 03:20:32.132
Hello, Lorraine Richards, excuse me, Lorraine Richards, California Teacher Association.

03:20:32.693 --> 03:20:40.175
The petition was denied locally by both the Board of Trustees and the San Diego County Board of Education, and we urge you to do the same.

03:20:40.795 --> 03:20:45.657
The concerns are transparency that includes the central operations of the Altus Charter Network,

03:20:46.477 --> 03:21:01.587
governance and educational equality, lack of parent participation in governance, and disproportionately high compensations, uphold the denial of the Altus-operated Sweetwater Education, excuse me, Secondary School.

03:21:02.108 --> 03:21:16.197
If the State Board of Education upholds the denial of this petition, the Sweetwater Secondary School is free to adjust their petition and resubmit, allowing the local school district to maintain oversight in the interests of the local community that they represent.

03:21:16.481 --> 03:21:16.771
Thank you.

03:21:21.607 --> 03:21:23.008
Eric Premack, Charter School Center.

03:21:23.148 --> 03:21:31.254
We have a 24-year track record of very sound operations financially, instructionally, so on and so forth.

03:21:31.474 --> 03:21:33.135
We strongly support the petition.

03:21:34.356 --> 03:21:49.147
Also would remind you that when the petitioners came forward at a prior meeting, board member Burr, who I hope is playing a nice round of golf today, also noted her experience with the petitioners going on long back into charter history.

03:21:49.307 --> 03:21:50.348
So I hope you'll support.

03:21:50.408 --> 03:21:50.668
Thank you.

03:21:55.151 --> 03:21:58.133
Good afternoon, Michelle Lynch on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association.

03:21:58.193 --> 03:21:59.233
I'll echo Eric's comments.

03:21:59.253 --> 03:22:04.636
We have a very long history with this organization and we are very confident in their ability to implement this program.

03:22:04.656 --> 03:22:06.858
We would ask today that you support their petition.

03:22:06.938 --> 03:22:07.238
Thank you.

03:22:11.465 --> 03:22:12.486
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen of the board.

03:22:12.526 --> 03:22:14.387
Paul Minney, legal counsel for the Charter School.

03:22:14.927 --> 03:22:17.008
The interlocking officers here is not a detriment.

03:22:17.028 --> 03:22:18.790
In fact, it's a huge benefit, as Eric said.

03:22:19.330 --> 03:22:31.277
These are the same officers that have been operating the Charter School of San Diego successfully for over 20 years, as you heard, with clean audits, multiple renewals, which are quite extensive at San Diego Unified School District, governance awards like the Malcolm Baldrige Award.

03:22:31.698 --> 03:22:36.981
These are high integrity officers that are operating this nonprofit public benefit corporation.

03:22:37.601 --> 03:22:45.487
To be clear, all operations of the charter school are subject to all state's transparency laws, all the Brown Act, Public Records Act, all state's conflicts of interest laws.

03:22:46.147 --> 03:22:51.751
And unlike some of the other charter schools we've recently reviewed, all charter schools operations are open to the public.

03:22:52.748 --> 03:22:54.309
There's no for-profit corporations.

03:22:54.529 --> 03:22:57.751
There's no common board members as you've heard from legal counsel from Sweetwater.

03:22:58.171 --> 03:22:59.452
This is not an expansion effort.

03:22:59.592 --> 03:23:05.796
Petitioners did exactly what Sweetwater demanded in litigation against other charter schools that are operating within their boundaries.

03:23:06.176 --> 03:23:06.996
Petition locally.

03:23:07.397 --> 03:23:07.917
They did that.

03:23:08.297 --> 03:23:18.383
They did that before Anderson because the San Diego Unified School District required all charter schools operated by Charter Schools San Diego to petition locally if they were operating outside their district boundaries.

03:23:18.543 --> 03:23:21.405
This is a simple conversion of an existing successful program.

03:23:21.505 --> 03:23:21.785
Thank you.

03:23:26.140 --> 03:23:30.462
So once again, this is an existing

03:23:55.538 --> 03:24:04.443
charter school in the sense that it is a conversion based upon the law now of a portion of the San Diego Charter School.

03:24:05.183 --> 03:24:24.794
I do believe that the petitioners have stepped up over the course of the past few months as we've heard previous petitions from them to continue to try to impress upon all of us that transparency is their goal and that they are trying to serve students well.

03:24:25.995 --> 03:24:31.279
And when the time comes, I would move that we recommend the staff recommendation.

03:24:37.165 --> 03:24:37.585
Thank you.

03:24:37.725 --> 03:24:44.151
I do have some questions I wanted to ask, but I don't want to begin, if I could, with the representatives for the charter school.

03:24:55.655 --> 03:25:09.982
Okay, so first of all, let me just say that unlike, I have come to look at these petitions and these appeals to the board, especially when they are so contentious, with a jaundiced eye.

03:25:10.082 --> 03:25:19.867
Because usually when the petitions are approved after such contention with a great deal of controversy, I find out later on that there were things that I should have known

03:25:20.447 --> 03:25:26.631
that I did not know and that's happened several times in very public ways at this board meeting.

03:25:26.651 --> 03:25:31.815
So I have some questions for you about some things I think are important for me to know.

03:25:31.835 --> 03:25:37.178
I want to make sure I understand in this organizational chart that I have and thank you for providing it.

03:25:37.798 --> 03:25:47.965
In the organizational chart I have, it is your clear explanation that these three different charter organizations, these three different corporations are separate and independent.

03:25:48.005 --> 03:25:48.686
Is that correct?

03:25:48.886 --> 03:25:48.986
Yes.

03:25:49.346 --> 03:26:11.944
Okay, so when you were going through and giving some examples about the performance and the success of your students, what I didn't hear, I heard a lot about San Diego, but what I didn't hear was about the other two charter schools that are directly under your responsibility and about what is going on with those charters.

03:26:12.364 --> 03:26:21.889
What I've heard from the attorney who represents your charter is that there's 24 years of success for the charter and that includes a number of renewals.

03:26:22.449 --> 03:26:30.673
But the other charters that are under your direct responsibility were only approved by the board and that's the thing that all three of these charters

03:26:31.193 --> 03:26:32.374
seem to have in common.

03:26:32.814 --> 03:26:43.202
Can you tell me why there was such a contentious problem at the local level and the county office level, given the success you've had with getting other charters approved in two other districts?

03:26:43.722 --> 03:26:49.146
What do you feel was the problem that seems to be common among these three charters?

03:26:52.406 --> 03:26:56.729
And I don't mean to make that a pointed question, even though I recognize it is.

03:26:57.150 --> 03:27:05.976
I'm trying to understand, given the success you have with charters that have been locally authorized, what seems to be the problem with these three?

03:27:09.459 --> 03:27:10.800
The three you're referring to?

03:27:11.100 --> 03:27:15.283
Dale Charter School 2, Grosvenor Secondary and now Sweetwater Secondary.

03:27:16.544 --> 03:27:16.944
If I may.

03:27:18.325 --> 03:27:25.050
Well, it's impossible on the first part for us to speak on behalf of any of the school districts who denied these petitions.

03:27:25.450 --> 03:27:31.554
But you know what you were told, so I want to understand what seems to be common among these three schools, in your opinion.

03:27:31.614 --> 03:27:33.415
I am asking for your opinion.

03:27:33.495 --> 03:27:39.880
My opinion is that these school districts are trying to claw back ADA, plain and simple.

03:27:41.124 --> 03:27:42.324
That's the issue.

03:27:42.645 --> 03:27:48.607
There are political forces at issue here that have nothing to do with students, unfortunately.

03:27:48.927 --> 03:27:52.468
These programs have been, were previously operated by the charter schools.

03:27:52.488 --> 03:27:53.168
You can stop.

03:27:53.328 --> 03:27:53.608
Okay.

03:27:54.549 --> 03:27:54.809
Okay.

03:27:55.049 --> 03:27:55.849
Well, no, I'm not done.

03:27:55.989 --> 03:27:56.189
Okay.

03:27:56.209 --> 03:27:56.909
All right.

03:27:56.950 --> 03:27:58.010
So, here's my next question.

03:27:58.070 --> 03:28:00.851
So, can you tell me

03:28:02.313 --> 03:28:12.423
What is the average, what is the experience level, the range of experience with your certificated staff?

03:28:12.463 --> 03:28:17.929
Who's the, how long have they been employed by your corporation?

03:28:19.545 --> 03:28:28.210
Well, as I stated earlier, 60% of the teachers have been with us more than six years, and only 15% have been with us three years or less.

03:28:28.230 --> 03:28:29.431
Okay, so those are numbers.

03:28:29.471 --> 03:28:31.392
That could be you have 10 teachers employed.

03:28:31.412 --> 03:28:32.453
So that, yeah.

03:28:32.533 --> 03:28:43.299
So the numbers I'm working off would be a total of 64 teachers, 39 of which are six years or greater with the organization, the Charter School of San Diego.

03:28:43.600 --> 03:28:45.781
And who made the decision to hire those teachers?

03:28:47.259 --> 03:28:50.560
Those are senior leadership through, we have a hiring process.

03:28:50.620 --> 03:28:51.880
That's a three-step process.

03:28:52.660 --> 03:28:55.301
So the board for this corporation made the decision?

03:28:56.782 --> 03:29:02.183
Ultimately, they're made by the senior leaders of this corporation.

03:29:02.863 --> 03:29:03.163
Okay.

03:29:03.663 --> 03:29:07.484
And the employment agreement, is that, who is that developed by?

03:29:07.504 --> 03:29:13.966
It's developed by senior leadership, HR, internal HR, and legal counsel.

03:29:14.748 --> 03:29:26.254
And is it fair to say that the employment agreement that you have is an employment agreement unique to your corporation or is it similar to the employment agreement for the other two corporations listed on this chart?

03:29:27.695 --> 03:29:28.975
I'm a bit confused by the question.

03:29:29.356 --> 03:29:30.096
Can you repeat it?

03:29:31.124 --> 03:29:35.550
So you have a contract for the certificated employees you've hired.

03:29:36.131 --> 03:29:38.895
You told me that it was approved and developed.

03:29:38.935 --> 03:29:44.282
These people were hired by your corporation, by the senior leadership of your corporation.

03:29:44.362 --> 03:29:46.846
I'm asking who wrote the employment agreement.

03:29:48.201 --> 03:29:54.950
The employment agreement was written by the corporation's senior staff, the HR, internal HR of the corporation in conjunction with legal counsel.

03:29:55.171 --> 03:30:02.141
Okay, then my second question is, was this, is this employment agreement the same employment agreement for the other two corporations?

03:30:02.714 --> 03:30:02.934
Yes.

03:30:03.834 --> 03:30:07.376
So how was that employment agreement approved by the other two corporations?

03:30:07.516 --> 03:30:09.517
Let me rephrase my answer.

03:30:09.537 --> 03:30:13.758
My answer is that the form and the terms are the same.

03:30:14.119 --> 03:30:15.459
They are not the same contract.

03:30:15.819 --> 03:30:28.364
So if a person is, if a teacher, a certificated teacher is going to teach at Audeo Charter School 2, they are going to be employed by Audeo Charter School Corporation, receive their pay from Audeo Charter School Corporation, and have a contract with Audeo Charter School Corporation.

03:30:28.444 --> 03:30:32.326
But the contract itself is the same for all three corporations?

03:30:33.732 --> 03:30:39.113
for the most part, in terms, payment, those kinds of things to provide operational consistency.

03:30:39.873 --> 03:30:51.716
Do the teachers who are employed and approved for service by your corporation teach students or have contact online with students from any of these other schools?

03:30:54.196 --> 03:30:54.316
No.

03:30:54.596 --> 03:30:55.217
Okay.

03:30:55.237 --> 03:30:59.598
And I'm assuming you receive federal funds like from the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.

03:31:00.138 --> 03:31:01.438
Who wrote that school plan?

03:31:06.730 --> 03:31:08.291
be members of the senior leadership team.

03:31:08.712 --> 03:31:18.419
And since there is a requirement for parents whose children attend this school to participate as stakeholders in writing that plan, how were parents included?

03:31:19.980 --> 03:31:28.546
So we had various opportunities through open house nights, through working sessions on the school plan, through surveys directed to parents.

03:31:29.427 --> 03:31:35.732
And how were teachers that were employed by your corporation included for writing that school plan?

03:31:40.137 --> 03:31:40.997
Hi, I'm Stephanie Starr.

03:31:41.037 --> 03:31:49.381
We do have a school site councils that are charged with the development of the school site plan, LEA plan.

03:31:49.441 --> 03:31:51.302
I'm not asking about the LCAP.

03:31:51.342 --> 03:31:53.142
I'm asking about the plan that was submitted.

03:31:53.182 --> 03:31:57.404
The single school plan for student achievement for our intensive purposes.

03:31:57.544 --> 03:32:01.986
That is this one in the same as the LEA plan, which is different than the LCAP.

03:32:02.166 --> 03:32:03.227
OK, I understand.

03:32:03.607 --> 03:32:08.209
And so for this plan, are there three different plans that were submitted for each corporation?

03:32:08.609 --> 03:32:08.789
Yes.

03:32:10.290 --> 03:32:10.510
All right.

03:32:11.812 --> 03:32:12.412
Okay, thank you.

03:32:18.259 --> 03:32:22.784
So in reviewing this, when did this structure come to be?

03:32:23.324 --> 03:32:30.272
When did this become all of the schools under Odeo and student success programs?

03:32:31.057 --> 03:32:32.819
There was a reorganization in January of 2016.

03:32:33.960 --> 03:32:34.060
Of 2016?

03:32:35.261 --> 03:32:46.693
Because as I Google your schools and the CEO's message, it always references Altus as the company or the organization of which all of these fall under.

03:32:46.713 --> 03:32:48.915
And I Googled all of them.

03:32:50.918 --> 03:32:52.699
Altus is a name that gets thrown around a lot.

03:32:52.739 --> 03:33:05.643
That was a, if you will, brand name, essentially, a way to tie the information and the educational program between all the schools when looking at recruiting students and things like that.

03:33:05.663 --> 03:33:09.204
It does not indicate necessarily a connection to the other entity.

03:33:09.304 --> 03:33:16.826
It does not indicate a direct relationship or ownership at all at this time.

03:33:18.092 --> 03:33:21.336
So then you need to update all of your websites.

03:33:21.836 --> 03:33:25.820
So is there anything that could still possibly be integrated?

03:33:27.923 --> 03:33:34.450
Monies, programs, contracts that may still be integrated because of the structure you once had?

03:33:35.589 --> 03:33:38.532
And I can answer that question actually conclusively, and that is no.

03:33:39.192 --> 03:33:54.002
The Altus Institute is actually, I believe, and they have counsel here actually to answer questions that they are asked, but my understanding is that they are looking at dissolving that organization because these schools are operating in compliance with law and are independent.

03:33:55.848 --> 03:33:58.429
But there are no contracts between the two organizations.

03:33:58.469 --> 03:34:00.550
There is no money that will flow to that organization.

03:34:01.210 --> 03:34:15.196
And the contract that was in existence for the previous year was extended prior to its end date by both organizations, students by Audio Charter School Corporation and Altus Institute prior to its term date, which was June 30th, because

03:34:15.976 --> 03:34:17.596
These schools had become independent.

03:34:17.656 --> 03:34:21.797
They had been operating for a year, at least the student success programs in Audea Charter School 2.

03:34:22.578 --> 03:34:28.379
And then we were hopeful for approval here, which would have concluded the charitable purpose of those organizations.

03:34:28.399 --> 03:34:32.820
Jeff, I just want to follow up on that.

03:34:32.840 --> 03:34:34.481
Is this your current chart?

03:34:34.501 --> 03:34:36.021
And did you hand this out to us?

03:34:36.921 --> 03:34:37.822
This is the current chart.

03:34:37.902 --> 03:34:40.602
And this is what we included to the CDE.

03:34:40.662 --> 03:34:41.422
We brought it to the CDE.

03:34:41.442 --> 03:34:43.283
And this was provided to you by CDE.

03:34:44.259 --> 03:34:45.239
We did not hand that out to you.

03:34:45.900 --> 03:34:46.520
The department did.

03:34:47.881 --> 03:34:50.662
We crafted and submitted it to the department, yes.

03:34:50.882 --> 03:34:55.524
And it's now, this is a current, this is the current setup.

03:34:55.624 --> 03:34:56.984
That has been the setup since January 2016.

03:34:57.524 --> 03:34:57.805
Pardon?

03:35:02.186 --> 03:35:02.547
Okay.

03:35:03.647 --> 03:35:08.329
I'm just getting clear where this, you submitted to the department, the department gave it to us.

03:35:09.577 --> 03:35:09.777
Right.

03:35:10.358 --> 03:35:10.478
Okay.

03:35:10.498 --> 03:35:12.742
I'm just trying to figure out, make sure where this came from.

03:35:13.483 --> 03:35:16.246
Other board member comments or questions?

03:35:20.171 --> 03:35:21.912
So just really to our liaisons.

03:35:22.232 --> 03:35:28.997
So this is concerning to me because we've been dealing with all different kinds of structure.

03:35:29.637 --> 03:35:35.661
My belief from the students is that they're getting good support for alternative programs to meet their particular needs.

03:35:35.721 --> 03:35:40.524
So I appreciate the students coming and for the parents who talked about what the program is doing for them.

03:35:40.604 --> 03:35:43.866
So for me, it's not about the support that they're getting.

03:35:44.046 --> 03:35:44.787
It's about this

03:35:45.447 --> 03:35:46.148
these structures.

03:35:46.368 --> 03:35:50.092
And we've seen them before and they're complicated.

03:35:50.112 --> 03:35:54.257
I just wonder if ACCS and the liaisons had gone through this.

03:35:54.678 --> 03:35:59.944
Again, it's a unique to this setting and it's really not reflecting the quality.

03:35:59.984 --> 03:36:05.110
I'm just more interested in the organization and why all these different structures.

03:36:05.418 --> 03:36:11.142
So over the years, there have been a number of charter organizations that have had complicated governance systems.

03:36:11.683 --> 03:36:27.534
And they have, from time to time, created concern in people's minds because it's difficult to go through the connections and understand very clearly, transparently, who's on first and who's on second.

03:36:28.715 --> 03:36:33.578
The thing that makes me feel comfortable about this situation is that, first of all, we're dealing with a

03:36:35.461 --> 03:36:43.348
an organization that has run a very successful charter school for a very long time, and it's provided very good services for the young people.

03:36:43.929 --> 03:36:53.397
I do believe that when you compare Apples to Apples, that their credit recovery program, that their individualized attention is serving students very well.

03:36:57.592 --> 03:37:09.243
To their credit, I do believe that they are proactive about what is changing in terms of clarification of the law and resource center locations and all that.

03:37:09.304 --> 03:37:20.775
And they were ahead of the game in terms of trying to solve that problem and spare their kids from disruption in their educational program.

03:37:22.930 --> 03:37:31.166
I also think they've been proactive in trying to clarify and make more streamlined, if you will.

03:37:32.924 --> 03:37:51.077
their organizational structure in an effort to prove transparently what they believe all along, and that has been that there's no wrongdoing, there's no behind-the-scenes hanky-panky, but instead it is simply clearly laid out now.

03:37:51.237 --> 03:37:55.961
And this reorganization didn't happen in December or November.

03:37:56.021 --> 03:38:00.304
This reorganization happened in January of 2016, and although there

03:38:02.300 --> 03:38:12.108
Google may be not catching up very fast and maybe their websites certainly need to be, I know, and their websites haven't caught up.

03:38:12.248 --> 03:38:14.610
And there's still a lot to do in those sorts of ways.

03:38:14.970 --> 03:38:22.696
I do believe that the organizational chart that they have shown us that came through the CDE is the correct organizational chart.

03:38:23.057 --> 03:38:24.598
And what we're really doing is we're

03:38:26.125 --> 03:38:36.481
If we approve, we're approving this portion of the San Diego Charter School conversion into the Sweetwater Charter School, and that's why I would approve it.

03:38:42.578 --> 03:38:50.519
So, I hear the concerns and I think I've made a comment at one of the previous meeting that I'm an old-fashioned charter school person.

03:38:50.539 --> 03:38:54.780
So, I don't understand charter schools that have these corporations and parent corporations and all of these.

03:38:55.460 --> 03:39:00.721
However, in this case, I do see this chart is very, very helpful.

03:39:01.601 --> 03:39:08.062
It's very clear that there is a corporation for those charters authorized under the State Board.

03:39:08.262 --> 03:39:10.203
Another one for those authorized under

03:39:11.723 --> 03:39:17.946
San Diego Unified School District and another one for Hesperia Unified School District.

03:39:18.146 --> 03:39:20.587
And I can see the rationale for that.

03:39:20.887 --> 03:39:22.728
You're dealing with different authorizers.

03:39:22.748 --> 03:39:27.710
So you want a corporate, you want a government body to deal in those different ways.

03:39:28.190 --> 03:39:29.671
So it's very clear.

03:39:29.691 --> 03:39:29.751
Now,

03:39:30.971 --> 03:39:34.352
The website needs to catch up with this, clearly.

03:39:34.372 --> 03:39:42.175
And I think the concern is the transparency of if a parent or someone from the public wanted to know information, how do they know where to go?

03:39:42.316 --> 03:39:45.617
So that's just, that's something that's technical that they can fix.

03:39:45.657 --> 03:39:50.899
But if this is true, this is the true corporation, then I don't have an issue with this.

03:39:54.019 --> 03:39:58.124
And keep in mind that by corporation it's a non-profit 501c3.

03:39:58.905 --> 03:40:01.829
It's not corporate as in, you know.

03:40:01.849 --> 03:40:01.909
Yes.

03:40:06.601 --> 03:40:18.846
Yeah, I think part of the issue we're facing here is a number of people, including me, are not familiar with how nonprofits are organized and governed that much.

03:40:19.567 --> 03:40:35.654
And I know you've run a nonprofit and so on, but I've studied government and written books on the politics of governance, but we never got into nonprofit private organizations.

03:40:36.688 --> 03:40:44.673
And I don't even understand why some are tax exempt and others pay, file with IRS and all that stuff.

03:40:44.693 --> 03:40:54.539
So it's, you know, the board here is struggling to understand, at least I am, I should speak for, exactly what these organizations are like.

03:40:54.599 --> 03:41:01.283
And we're really, I particular, I'm just lacking in the basics of the governance system that we're operating.

03:41:02.298 --> 03:41:04.880
To your point, sir, I've worked in nonprofits only.

03:41:05.380 --> 03:41:07.221
Yeah, worked in only government.

03:41:07.902 --> 03:41:08.122
Right.

03:41:08.362 --> 03:41:15.186
And so and this sort of approach and the way they've set it up with these independent boards is certainly something that's done.

03:41:18.208 --> 03:41:19.349
Yeah, I agree, it's common.

03:41:19.409 --> 03:41:24.512
It's just we're trying to educate ourselves, not that we object.

03:41:24.592 --> 03:41:27.454
I'm just trying to understand it better in that regard.

03:41:28.132 --> 03:41:39.115
Stanford's a nonprofit, but we don't have a lot of third party things and affiliates.

03:41:39.235 --> 03:41:39.995
Not boards.

03:41:40.375 --> 03:41:42.436
It all goes back to a board of trustees.

03:41:42.936 --> 03:41:47.277
There is no alternative board at Stanford other than the Stanford Board of Trustees.

03:41:48.363 --> 03:41:51.425
And I think UC really ends up at the Regents.

03:41:51.965 --> 03:41:57.628
So these are pretty, the universities are not the same, I would think, as anything like this.

03:41:58.729 --> 03:42:00.750
And they're operating in different school districts.

03:42:01.310 --> 03:42:03.031
You know, we're a unified university.

03:42:03.491 --> 03:42:06.353
I'm just trying to grasp this a little bit better.

03:42:06.633 --> 03:42:11.035
And because it's become such a complex issue.

03:42:11.256 --> 03:42:11.976
Board Member Rucker.

03:42:13.137 --> 03:42:31.342
did have some questions, but I do want to say having gone through, I asked the questions pointedly that I asked of the representatives from the Audeo Charter School, primarily because they actually do operate, in my opinion, based on the evidence that I saw, they do operate and seem to have

03:42:31.722 --> 03:42:39.106
a single overriding board of directors because I looked at the single plan for student achievement for all three corporations.

03:42:39.506 --> 03:42:51.651
And in the good old days when we had all those consultants who were going to schools and writing these school improvement plans and they had a template and simply filled in the blank on those plans, that's how those plans read.

03:42:51.691 --> 03:42:52.672
So somebody

03:42:53.052 --> 03:43:08.261
had to contract for and develop and write not only those single plans but the employment agreements as well as each of the plans that were written for them to address any of the applications for the categorical programs and funds that they were currently used.

03:43:08.301 --> 03:43:12.223
They read like a template document and they read like a cut and paste document.

03:43:12.243 --> 03:43:14.484
So somebody approved and crafted that.

03:43:14.504 --> 03:43:15.545
So they are operating

03:43:16.025 --> 03:43:18.647
as a single entity under somebody's umbrella.

03:43:19.108 --> 03:43:28.016
These are the things I'm saying that when we have these kind of controversies, I find them out later after we approve them that this is what the reality was.

03:43:28.476 --> 03:43:33.040
More, I believe, more what I read on the website than what I read in this document.

03:43:33.100 --> 03:43:37.004
But I do have some questions for the district representatives as well.

03:43:51.403 --> 03:43:53.644
Everyone else had to make a 1.30 flight, but I stayed.

03:43:54.184 --> 03:43:55.464
Hopefully, I can answer your questions.

03:43:55.844 --> 03:43:56.664
I'm glad you stayed.

03:43:57.025 --> 03:43:58.785
Do you have charter schools in your district?

03:43:58.985 --> 03:43:59.185
Yes.

03:43:59.385 --> 03:44:00.645
That were approved by your board?

03:44:00.806 --> 03:44:01.006
Yes.

03:44:01.266 --> 03:44:03.966
So, what was different for the approval of this charter?

03:44:04.026 --> 03:44:09.468
I still don't, I'm not real, I understand their perception and they're entitled to their perception.

03:44:10.268 --> 03:44:20.813
And I understand, so the contention between you as an LEA and those folks as the representatives of the charter, that doesn't bother me and I'm not surprised by that.

03:44:21.314 --> 03:44:30.718
But if this is, because this is a successful program and these are people who have successfully been able to have these charters authorized locally.

03:44:31.579 --> 03:44:37.442
I don't understand why there's a problem that seems to be common among these three charters

03:44:37.863 --> 03:44:40.411
that they also could not be approved locally.

03:44:40.491 --> 03:44:45.285
So, I suppose the question I'm asking is what's wrong with you, but that's not what I really mean.

03:44:47.361 --> 03:44:57.525
The issue at the local level was that this is a school that's operating privately and does things like corporate restructuring without anyone knowing about it that gets found out after the fact.

03:44:57.985 --> 03:45:06.988
And so they had opened charter schools in both Sweetwater and Grossmont's boundaries, had been told by Sweetwater and Grossmont that we think that's illegal and you have to come to us, and they said,

03:45:07.808 --> 03:45:08.789
Too bad, we're going to stay.

03:45:09.449 --> 03:45:19.175
And then when it became clear that that was the correct interpretation, they dropped petitions off that had different names on them and didn't disclose that that was, in fact, the plan.

03:45:20.356 --> 03:45:22.017
And so it further

03:45:23.157 --> 03:45:30.860
caused the board to be concerned about the lack of transparency because now the charter that they had been attempting to address for years was now calling themselves something else.

03:45:30.900 --> 03:45:32.001
They had a development team.

03:45:32.961 --> 03:45:34.402
They'd done a corporate restructuring.

03:45:34.422 --> 03:45:40.024
But at the same time, they're proposing for Mary Bixby to sit on the board and be the CEO.

03:45:40.144 --> 03:45:44.366
And she sat on the board and was the CEO of the corporation we were already dealing with.

03:45:45.406 --> 03:45:53.028
And so, it was just a renaming, papering over of an operation that there were already concerns with that made no effort to disclose those.

03:45:53.549 --> 03:45:54.949
We got no organizational chart.

03:45:55.929 --> 03:46:00.431
We attempted to figure out what their organization was by publicly available information.

03:46:00.871 --> 03:46:09.373
For example, we can't figure out how any of the development team gets paid or which corporation they're employed by from what we can tell from federal tax records.

03:46:09.754 --> 03:46:10.874
They're all employed by Altus.

03:46:12.846 --> 03:46:37.061
And so I don't know who's making that is who's hiring these people or who's paying for the Sweetwater development team And as you saw today several of the same people that had the same prepared speeches came to speak to you Supporting this petition that came and spoke with the same speech in support of the Grossmont petition And so we it appeared to just be a corporate effort to expand and nothing to do and paper over the prior violations that were already

03:46:38.635 --> 03:46:42.078
in the process of attempting to be addressed by just calling it something else.

03:46:42.579 --> 03:46:46.802
But yet being a part of the exact same network that we can't figure out who is actually controlling.

03:46:47.323 --> 03:46:47.583
Okay.

03:46:47.683 --> 03:46:51.787
And so for the charter, they've identified what they believe their enrollment will be.

03:46:51.827 --> 03:46:57.452
How many students out of your LEA, are all of these students going to be coming from your LEA for this charter?

03:46:58.052 --> 03:46:59.273
It's very difficult for us to tell.

03:46:59.333 --> 03:47:00.054
We assume so.

03:47:00.614 --> 03:47:07.940
You know, obviously, when they're located and operating in the boundaries, most of the ADA, most of the students do come from the district in which it's located.

03:47:08.761 --> 03:47:16.988
But we've really struggled to figure out which students are at which resource center and which ADA goes to which of these corporations.

03:47:17.188 --> 03:47:24.534
And they entirely control behind closed doors what the sign says and who's there and who's being employed and who's representing them.

03:47:25.335 --> 03:47:26.156
And so it really is

03:47:27.955 --> 03:47:32.820
very difficult to figure out because these decisions are made privately.

03:47:32.840 --> 03:47:37.806
Okay, and I asked you that question because I already knew what that answer was going to be.

03:47:37.886 --> 03:47:50.059
This was some of the conversation, thank you, this was some of the conversation that came up and that became really of great concern as the work was being done to develop

03:47:50.479 --> 03:47:59.789
the board's new policy concerning the resource centers and the location of these resource centers in response to the Supreme Court decision.

03:48:00.269 --> 03:48:06.916
It is, the state has no way and most districts do not have a way of actually tracking or monitoring

03:48:07.316 --> 03:48:16.451
who is actually enrolled or who the teachers are actually serving among these schools just because of the way they have been allowed to operate for so long.

03:48:16.831 --> 03:48:22.320
So that was part of the reason why I asked the question of the charter representatives if any of their teachers

03:48:22.700 --> 03:48:28.001
work with or serve students who belong to or are attending some of the other charters.

03:48:28.361 --> 03:48:36.782
And that's the reason why I asked the district, are you aware if all of the students projected to be part of this enrollment will be coming directly from their district?

03:48:37.163 --> 03:48:47.824
There is a reason why I actually do believe that the chart and the information that's shown on the website is actually more accurate than this one for that reason.

03:48:48.164 --> 03:48:51.025
Because there are students who probably do attend

03:48:51.425 --> 03:49:00.371
or participate in these charter programs that are shared as a, I hate to use this word, but it's true, as a common resource among these three charters.

03:49:00.791 --> 03:49:14.200
And I do believe their human capital and their employees are a common resource among these charters just because of the fact that the employment agreement looks exactly the same from corporation to corporation.

03:49:14.660 --> 03:49:18.523
So this is going to be some of that stuff that when you approve this charter,

03:49:18.923 --> 03:49:29.067
Just as we have had with almost every single charter hearing we've had this year, we will find out after the fact something to be of surprise to us as a board.

03:49:29.527 --> 03:49:35.709
This is going to be a charter that you will approve that becomes our board charter along with the other two that they are managing.

03:49:38.070 --> 03:49:51.016
And again, I want to point out what's common among all three of these charters is that these are the same charter management organizations that have been successful in approving charters at the local level.

03:49:51.676 --> 03:49:54.197
And for some reason, there is some common factor

03:49:54.637 --> 03:50:02.582
among these three entities that creates a problem for approval, not only by the district, but by the county office as well.

03:50:03.023 --> 03:50:04.884
I think you should pay attention to that.

03:50:05.224 --> 03:50:07.826
That is a very difficult thing for me to ignore.

03:50:08.286 --> 03:50:15.531
If they want us to value their experience and their 20-something years of experience with successfully approving charters,

03:50:16.031 --> 03:50:28.958
We need to pay attention to the fact that the county offices and the local school districts that previously approved their programs have not been able to approve the other two that we approved anyway.

03:50:29.338 --> 03:50:33.100
And now we're asked to do the same thing for a third time.

03:50:33.480 --> 03:50:37.842
I think that is something that has to be considered and paid attention to.

03:50:37.862 --> 03:50:41.344
Okay, I think we're ready for a motion.

03:50:42.395 --> 03:50:46.741
Thank you, Member Rucker, and I do think you are correct in your assumptions in many, many ways.

03:50:46.801 --> 03:50:47.261
I really do.

03:50:47.502 --> 03:50:47.842
Thank you.

03:50:48.963 --> 03:50:51.306
That being said, I would move the staff recommendation.

03:50:55.632 --> 03:50:56.713
Further board discussion?

03:50:56.733 --> 03:50:59.176
If not, all those in favor, raise your hands.

03:51:00.037 --> 03:51:00.318
Sorry.

03:51:01.463 --> 03:51:04.606
I'm just going to say that I'm going to vote on the good faith of what's in front of me.

03:51:05.407 --> 03:51:09.891
My organization on Monday had a name change after 49 years.

03:51:10.091 --> 03:51:14.855
And today you cannot find our former name on any of our materials.

03:51:15.296 --> 03:51:22.922
And so for me, I'm going to vote with what's in front of me because I want to believe that what is in front of me is actually how things are being implemented.

03:51:23.303 --> 03:51:23.563
Thank you.

03:51:31.092 --> 03:51:31.352
All right.

03:51:31.392 --> 03:51:33.193
All those in favor of the motion, raise your hands.

03:51:34.133 --> 03:51:35.213
Okay.

03:51:35.673 --> 03:51:36.273
One no vote.

03:51:36.593 --> 03:51:36.953
Okay.

03:51:37.794 --> 03:51:39.274
So it's approved with one no vote.

03:51:39.374 --> 03:51:52.817
So we will move on to item 20, which are... State board projects and priorities.

03:51:53.217 --> 03:51:56.438
And first of all, we need a motion to approve the minutes.

03:51:59.992 --> 03:52:01.193
Okay, moved and seconded.

03:52:01.393 --> 03:52:02.193
Any discussion?

03:52:03.634 --> 03:52:04.654
No public comment.

03:52:05.935 --> 03:52:07.655
Raise your hands if you approve.

03:52:08.316 --> 03:52:08.716
Okay.

03:52:09.356 --> 03:52:09.716
Minutes.

03:52:10.997 --> 03:52:11.357
Minutes.

03:52:12.077 --> 03:52:20.921
Okay, now we have liaison activities and we have a list of next generation science standards, Strauss-Williams.

03:52:23.241 --> 03:52:34.305
I'll just say that the early implementers network is continuing to work together and there's going to be two convenings of leadership, July 27th and August 3rd.

03:52:34.645 --> 03:52:40.987
And I'll be doing a state board update and talking with them about their work and the importance of their next step.

03:52:41.027 --> 03:52:46.548
So, very exciting work as we really go to full implementation of our next generation science standards.

03:52:48.969 --> 03:52:51.390
Okay, Charters Holliday-Williams.

03:52:54.907 --> 03:52:55.548
Just did that.

03:52:57.251 --> 03:52:59.495
CTC Strauss.

03:53:00.845 --> 03:53:04.006
Just a quick summary, CTC met June 15th and 16th.

03:53:04.586 --> 03:53:07.827
A couple of highlights just particularly related to our state board work.

03:53:08.067 --> 03:53:16.229
They're doing a realignment of the admin services credential, their content and their performance expectations aligned to the standards for leaders.

03:53:16.629 --> 03:53:24.711
And particularly I thought would be interesting is they're focusing on aligning the expectations around school leadership and the work around school climate.

03:53:25.291 --> 03:53:27.834
and engagement of community and families.

03:53:27.874 --> 03:53:35.041
Those particular areas really link a lot to what we've been talking about in updating leadership skills around our expectations of engagement.

03:53:35.061 --> 03:53:47.454
So again, a lot of their work is updating and realigning, but particularly with our goals at State Board that we want leaders to be doing, it's exciting to see the alignment in the expectations of the preparation program.

03:53:49.312 --> 03:53:53.215
Okay, CCEE, Board Member Burr is not here.

03:53:53.295 --> 03:53:54.856
So I don't think we have anything on that.

03:53:55.377 --> 03:53:56.978
Computer Science, Williams.

03:53:57.478 --> 03:54:02.302
Yes, I'm going to read something so that I can be pretty quick about this.

03:54:03.123 --> 03:54:16.213
But the entire computer science advocacy community in California and not to mention quite a few nationally have been waiting for California to take its first big steps in terms of computer science policy.

03:54:16.733 --> 03:54:36.108
So on June 27th, Governor Brown approved a 2017-18 state budget that included funding for the CDE and the State Board to move forward with two separate but complementary activities related to expanding and diversifying student access in K-12 to computer science.

03:54:36.889 --> 03:54:50.375
One of those activities will be the development of recommendations for voluntary computer science content standards that would provide substantive but flexible guidance to LEAs as they bring computer science into their curricula.

03:54:51.095 --> 03:54:52.255
Toward that end, this body

03:54:53.556 --> 03:55:04.181
This body, the State Board, yesterday approved item 13 on consent, which created the Computer Science Academic Standards Committee.

03:55:05.201 --> 03:55:12.185
It also approved the 21 members recommended to be on that committee by the Instructional Quality Commission.

03:55:12.785 --> 03:55:21.089
And your vote yesterday also approved the State Board's guidance to the Standards Committee for what they want to see out of that work.

03:55:21.929 --> 03:55:32.232
This Commission is expected to begin its work in meetings in from September through January with recommendations coming to the State Board for consideration a year from now.

03:55:33.172 --> 03:55:44.496
The second and separate activity funded in the 2017-18 State Budget was the convening of a Computer Science Strategic Implementation Advisory Panel.

03:55:45.436 --> 03:56:10.325
The statute calls for this panel to be convened on or before March 1st, 2018 and to have recommendations to the State Board, the SPI and the legislature on how best to implement computer science standards throughout California in terms of building teacher capacity and what additional resources might be needed to have those to us by January 15th on or before January 15th, 2019.

03:56:12.506 --> 03:56:21.968
Again, this is going to be another fast-moving effort, both of them that will be moving pretty much in sync with one another over the next 18-20 months.

03:56:22.689 --> 03:56:35.192
This second panel, the advisory panel on implementation, will undertake the development of recommendations critical to the effective and equitable implementation of computer science in California K-12.

03:56:35.852 --> 03:56:38.973
The panel will consist of a designated set of members,

03:56:39.993 --> 03:56:49.457
many appointed by Governor Brown and others by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, and some by the Assembly Speaker's Office and the Senate Rules Committee.

03:56:50.237 --> 03:57:03.023
So California is not the first state to move forward on implementing computer science education at the K-12 level, but by ensuring funding for these two separate but complementary efforts,

03:57:04.043 --> 03:57:28.279
California standards and a strategic implementation plan, Governor Brown has in effect launched a thoughtful and thorough two-pronged state policy approach to expanding and diversifying computer science in California that will encourage and support all districts and charter schools as they make decisions about how best to bring this important new K-12 discipline to their students.

03:57:29.272 --> 03:57:58.572
So as this work takes off now for the next 18 to 20 months, I want to thank and acknowledge the CDE leadership of Glenn Price, of Tom Adams and Stephanie Gregson, and others in the department that have been working hard to get this all set up, as well as I want to thank the Ed Tech Committee of the IQC and its chair, Dean Reese, for their good work this past year with completing all the prep work necessary for these two initiatives to get going.

03:57:59.412 --> 03:58:10.887
As the Board's liaison to computer science the past few years, I expect to be attending each of the meetings of the Standards Committee and of the Implementation Advisory.

03:58:11.768 --> 03:58:16.975
I'm excited to finally see this K-12 computer science work moving forward.

03:58:17.916 --> 03:58:31.449
And I very much look forward to working with the staff and the advisory bodies over the next 18 months, as well as continuing to learn and to network within the larger state and national computer science community.

03:58:32.330 --> 03:58:33.872
Excitement all around here.

03:58:36.377 --> 03:58:38.017
Okay, that's encouraging.

03:58:38.278 --> 03:58:40.058
Concurrence Commission, Strauss.

03:58:40.118 --> 03:58:42.759
So the Concurrence Commission met on June 7th in Oakland.

03:58:43.339 --> 03:58:48.320
Just quickly, it's the commission that coordinates the budget for the subject matter projects.

03:58:48.400 --> 03:58:56.002
And you may or may not be aware there are subject matter projects for arts, history, social science, international studies, mathematics,

03:58:56.502 --> 03:59:00.605
physical education, health, reading, literature, science, world language, and writing.

03:59:00.985 --> 03:59:02.225
And we meet twice a year.

03:59:02.586 --> 03:59:08.449
They really are doing some very thoughtful, deep work around continuing implementation of Common Core aligned activities.

03:59:08.809 --> 03:59:15.273
We did talk about ESSA, the development of the ESSA plan and the implications for that for their work.

03:59:15.714 --> 03:59:24.919
We did talk also about the role of leadership and because they primarily focus with teachers and the capacity and how they might help us with the leadership issue.

03:59:24.959 --> 03:59:25.940
And finally, their budgets

03:59:26.420 --> 03:59:28.743
small that they are were approved for the coming year.

03:59:28.763 --> 03:59:34.972
Okay, next is CPAG, Straus-Berr.

03:59:35.392 --> 03:59:38.136
Well, CPAG met to advise on the accountability.

03:59:38.216 --> 03:59:40.459
So you heard the input on that.

03:59:40.599 --> 03:59:42.482
English Learners, Ortiz-Lacombe.

03:59:44.385 --> 03:59:59.171
Yeah, so yesterday we adopted the new EEL roadmap and policy and there will be a guidance document coming, well it won't be coming before the board, but it will be completed in September and going out to the LEAs for support on how to implement the new policy.

04:00:01.392 --> 04:00:02.592
Environment holiday.

04:00:06.363 --> 04:00:11.985
The Environmental Literacy Steering Committee met on May 22nd, I think it was.

04:00:12.665 --> 04:00:20.348
We are making good progress toward implementing the strategies laid out in the California Blueprint for Environmental Literacy.

04:00:21.128 --> 04:00:29.191
Since the committee was formed in January of 2016, we're now at the point of having raised over $8 million for the initiative.

04:00:29.972 --> 04:00:41.723
including part of the state budget that's invested into a re-envisioning of the CREEC network, CREEC stands for California Regional Environmental Education Community.

04:00:42.304 --> 04:00:50.632
And that work is going on right now with over 100 stakeholders being involved in this re-envisioning process of the CREEC program.

04:00:51.352 --> 04:01:11.487
But one of the highlights of the May 22nd meeting for me was hearing from Carl Anthony, who is an architect and author and an urban and regional design strategist, co-founder of Breakthrough Communities in Oakland, who really helped us all understand the incredible importance

04:01:12.177 --> 04:01:15.079
of environmental literacy for underserved communities.

04:01:15.400 --> 04:01:32.752
When you think about who is first to be impacted and most to be impacted by environmental disasters such as Katrina or Flint or other pollution nightmares, it is often the low-income and underserved communities.

04:01:33.053 --> 04:01:36.015
You've really brought that to our attention in a powerful way.

04:01:38.101 --> 04:01:40.702
Okay, now we have the IQC.

04:01:41.522 --> 04:01:43.143
We have maybe six of these.

04:01:43.643 --> 04:01:46.744
IQC, ELA, ELD, Strauss.

04:01:47.124 --> 04:01:56.448
So there's a follow-up collaboration committee that is meeting next week again on July 20th here in Sacramento at the Doubletree Arden.

04:01:56.868 --> 04:02:04.151
And we've broken up into committees and they're just particularly for our work and the continued implementation of the literacy framework.

04:02:04.971 --> 04:02:07.473
There's a group dealing with delivery of instruction.

04:02:07.493 --> 04:02:16.259
There's also a work group on leadership capacity, which really will help our discussion around how do we help leadership as we continue to do instructional implementation.

04:02:16.339 --> 04:02:22.883
So I'll be there next week along with Joanne Isken, who's chair of CPAC and was the chair of IQC.

04:02:23.584 --> 04:02:34.351
And we'll be looking at continuing to support that work so I can bring that back as a report to September as we look to continue implementation of the framework and the instructional strategies.

04:02:35.672 --> 04:02:37.714
IQC Health, Ortiz-Lacromme.

04:02:38.955 --> 04:02:39.315
Thank you.

04:02:39.335 --> 04:02:41.757
And I want to thank Stephanie Gregson for all the support.

04:02:41.777 --> 04:02:47.362
I have not been able to attend this in person, but I am obviously keeping up to date.

04:02:48.183 --> 04:02:53.647
The Health Education Curriculum Framework and Evaluation Criteria Committee has met twice over the past three months.

04:02:54.208 --> 04:03:00.674
This is a passionate group of health educators excited to bring support and guidance to all educators through the health education framework.

04:03:01.394 --> 04:03:09.039
and they have provided edits and revisions to all TKA 12 grade level chapters, assessment chapter, and the supporting health education chapter.

04:03:09.760 --> 04:03:15.824
They will meet once again here, August 10th and 11th, and these are open meetings and we encourage the public to attend.

04:03:16.284 --> 04:03:23.489
But if you cannot attend, please do send your written comments to healtheducationframework at cde.ca.gov.

04:03:23.829 --> 04:03:24.690
And thank you, Stephanie, again.

04:03:26.761 --> 04:03:31.184
Okay, IQC History, Social Science, Rucker Sandoval.

04:03:32.385 --> 04:03:37.529
The History, Social Science Committee has been very busy since the last time we met.

04:03:38.030 --> 04:03:44.695
The committee has already had its training to do the preparation and vetting for the History, Social Science adoption.

04:03:45.195 --> 04:03:55.203
And they have, since the April training, the one week long training, they have now been, they have now received all their materials from the publishers and have been doing their review using the criteria.

04:03:55.683 --> 04:04:00.627
The curriculum adoption form is scheduled for later this month, July 24th through 28th.

04:04:01.087 --> 04:04:16.098
And so we anticipate at some point in time, by the next time we get to our board meeting in the fall, that we will be able to either identify and recommend new curriculum material for history social science or tell you what happened.

04:04:16.798 --> 04:04:18.799
So we're very excited about that process.

04:04:19.339 --> 04:04:23.162
And I want to again state this has been a very public, very open meeting.

04:04:23.682 --> 04:04:30.025
And members of the public are always invited to attend the meetings for the Curriculum Adoption Review process.

04:04:30.365 --> 04:04:32.467
And the Curriculum Adoption Forum is no different.

04:04:32.507 --> 04:04:38.530
There will be opportunities for the public to observe and participate during the forum week in July 24th through 28th.

04:04:38.890 --> 04:04:40.551
And it's going to be meeting at the Doubletree?

04:04:40.931 --> 04:04:43.873
Yes, the meetings are at the Doubletree over off of Arden Way.

04:04:44.750 --> 04:04:59.901
Okay, you're going to get a lot busier because the legislature appropriated somewhere between up to $20 million for rollout of history, social studies, and health.

04:05:00.441 --> 04:05:07.827
Now, we don't have a health framework to roll out, so a lot of this looks like it could be used for professional development.

04:05:08.727 --> 04:05:20.074
And so hopefully you can report next time on what you know about this and about what the money should go for and what the activities will be.

04:05:20.314 --> 04:05:23.896
I'd be happy to take on that responsibility and bring back that report for next time.

04:05:24.476 --> 04:05:25.957
Yeah, this money is really

04:05:26.457 --> 04:05:28.938
the most money we've ever had for a rollout.

04:05:29.058 --> 04:05:31.238
So... Well, there's a reason for it.

04:05:31.278 --> 04:05:32.078
So, yeah, I'd be happy.

04:05:32.098 --> 04:05:32.658
All right.

04:05:32.698 --> 04:05:33.619
There's a reason.

04:05:33.679 --> 04:05:33.939
Good.

04:05:34.059 --> 04:05:34.299
All right.

04:05:34.799 --> 04:05:37.379
IQC Mathematics, Rucker Strauss.

04:05:37.760 --> 04:05:38.100
Okay.

04:05:38.140 --> 04:05:50.162
So, I wanted to say that I had the opportunity at the invitation of department staff to attend the early math symposium that was scheduled at the Yolo County Office of Education in Woodland on June 23rd.

04:05:50.622 --> 04:05:52.323
The focus of the day was to support on

04:05:53.543 --> 04:05:59.449
to provide support to multiple initiatives, including the Whole Child Initiative and the Early Math Project.

04:05:59.889 --> 04:06:08.978
In addition to the 100-plus people who had registered to attend the forum, there were 1,625 people participating online.

04:06:09.438 --> 04:06:12.601
The keynote speaker was Dr. Megan Franke from UCLA.

04:06:13.802 --> 04:06:22.691
Here at the board, we spend a lot of time adopting and creating and reviewing policy documents like the math framework and the early learning foundational standards.

04:06:23.152 --> 04:06:30.900
The breakout sessions that were created and planned for the day really made the information in these documents living.

04:06:31.520 --> 04:06:45.971
The presentations looked at multi-tiered systems of support, mathematical reasoning, developing the academic language and literacy of young children in math, and looking at novel ways to use and implement manipulatives as part of the math instruction.

04:06:46.371 --> 04:06:49.153
It was an absolutely great day for the teachers who attended.

04:06:49.594 --> 04:06:57.940
Their feedback was their gratefulness that the forum could be done during the summer because a lot of them made it clear if it hadn't been scheduled during the summer,

04:06:58.340 --> 04:07:00.222
they never would have been able to attend.

04:07:00.242 --> 04:07:16.258
I think that suggests a lot of information about how we schedule and when we schedule activities like this and hopefully it will inform the ways that we include teachers who are early learning instructors in the rollout plans we have for future frameworks as well.

04:07:16.558 --> 04:07:20.662
So it was a wonderful opportunity and I'm very glad I had a chance to represent the board for it.

04:07:22.148 --> 04:07:23.689
Okay IQC science.

04:07:23.849 --> 04:07:28.672
So let me just say that the community communities of practice, both on mathematics and science.

04:07:29.132 --> 04:07:37.378
Those are groups of about 100 educators that come from all over our state, particularly regionally and over a couple days three times a year we

04:07:38.158 --> 04:07:44.723
build and deepen their knowledge and then also work on their follow-up activities out in the region to build capacity.

04:07:44.783 --> 04:07:51.028
So on August 16th in San Diego, right near the San Diego airport, Math and Science will actually be meeting on the same day.

04:07:51.369 --> 04:07:58.034
And so the idea in the first year was to deepen their community and their knowledge, but the intent in year two of the project

04:07:58.974 --> 04:08:04.736
is to begin to plan and do more regional outreach work to expand our work.

04:08:04.776 --> 04:08:11.379
So that's coming up and I'm going to be attending and hopefully maybe member Williams will be available as well because in San Diego.

04:08:11.419 --> 04:08:13.960
So anyway, I was going to drive there.

04:08:14.040 --> 04:08:14.280
Yes.

04:08:14.460 --> 04:08:16.021
So yeah, I was going to come.

04:08:16.681 --> 04:08:19.043
Depends on when my grandchild is born, but anyway.

04:08:19.663 --> 04:08:30.070
So anyway, I just wanted to say that once we develop the policies, developing and deepening the professional learning and building regional support networks in our vast state are really important.

04:08:30.110 --> 04:08:36.175
And so we have people coming from all over our state with the understanding that this is to build capacity throughout the region.

04:08:36.215 --> 04:08:41.258
So it's a very exciting process and that's what the ELA-ELD hopefully will continue to do over time.

04:08:41.819 --> 04:08:42.099
Thank you.

04:08:43.439 --> 04:08:43.639
Okay.

04:08:43.659 --> 04:08:46.061
The Joint Committee on Workforce Pathways.

04:08:46.382 --> 04:08:46.682
Sun?

04:08:47.162 --> 04:08:47.402
Yes.

04:08:48.143 --> 04:08:48.503
Great.

04:08:49.004 --> 04:08:52.067
I think this is the first time we've been on the queue to talk about.

04:08:52.107 --> 04:08:56.751
So we are meeting for the third time tomorrow as a group.

04:08:56.791 --> 04:09:07.240
And this is the Workforce Pathways Joint Advisory Committee is made up of three state board members and three members from the Community College Chancellor's Board of Governors.

04:09:08.060 --> 04:09:19.804
And the purpose of the committee is to do some talking and work on some systems alignment between K-14 with regards to career preparation.

04:09:20.344 --> 04:09:27.627
I'm not prepared to give you a summary of our work thus far, but I will give a more comprehensive summary of where we've gone.

04:09:27.747 --> 04:09:34.069
Mainly, it's been just looking at some information, looking at data, ways that we can share data and information.

04:09:34.409 --> 04:09:40.271
in what currently exists out there with regards to career and workforce preparation.

04:09:42.022 --> 04:09:48.908
Okay, then we have Special Ed and Summer School for the Arts, but Nikki Sandoval had to leave to get her plane.

04:09:49.668 --> 04:09:51.630
I have two ones.

04:09:51.670 --> 04:09:58.796
One, California has rejoined as a paying member, the Education Commission of the States.

04:09:59.317 --> 04:10:07.584
This is a group, national group of governors, legislators, state superintendents, state board members.

04:10:08.884 --> 04:10:26.032
And these are really interesting cross-state meetings and I had been invited before just to speak about California and I presented about our dashboard and then about our school finance formula, the money from the state to the local school districts at the meeting.

04:10:26.112 --> 04:10:33.195
So, and the governor has four appointments to make in this area and the assembly and the legislature also have appointments.

04:10:34.056 --> 04:10:37.081
Second, hopefully you'll be hearing more about this.

04:10:37.241 --> 04:10:41.629
I met with the WASC Accreditation Association.

04:10:41.790 --> 04:10:45.116
Again, this is, you know, Karen and I have met with them several times.

04:10:45.879 --> 04:10:55.487
They, as you hired our former staff member, Nancy Brownell, to help them bring their accreditation policies much closer to ours.

04:10:56.027 --> 04:11:02.333
And they produced a document that is really, I think, highly meshed with us.

04:11:02.413 --> 04:11:07.557
So at some point, I want to make public that we have some

04:11:08.248 --> 04:11:10.050
relationship with accreditation.

04:11:10.091 --> 04:11:14.556
They're not over here and we're over there, the way it's been for my entire career.

04:11:14.616 --> 04:11:17.360
So, and we will bring them in.

04:11:17.420 --> 04:11:22.166
And I also think that we talked about as we go into technical assistance,

04:11:22.987 --> 04:11:31.092
you know, for example, districts and schools that are undergoing WASC, that could be some part or the technical assistance for that time.

04:11:31.512 --> 04:11:37.856
They're also moving their accreditation, you know, into elementary and middle schools by request.

04:11:37.876 --> 04:11:39.397
They're really stepping up there.

04:11:40.077 --> 04:11:45.721
So I hope this will culminate in some formal relationship that can be announced between

04:11:46.321 --> 04:11:48.943
the department, the board, and the WASC.

04:11:49.624 --> 04:11:53.807
And that would be, I've never seen another state that's quite pulled that off.

04:11:53.888 --> 04:12:04.316
So, that would much aid our alignment policies, I think, where we're trying to align everything behind our standards and the other things we're doing.

04:12:04.376 --> 04:12:05.818
So, those are my two reports.

04:12:06.258 --> 04:12:08.660
And now, Board Member Sisson would like to make some comments.

04:12:10.819 --> 04:12:17.081
I just wanted to say a huge thank you to all of the SCE staff and board members for helping me through my time here.

04:12:17.841 --> 04:12:23.403
This was the best possible way that I could have chosen to spend my free time during my senior year.

04:12:23.423 --> 04:12:35.008
It was really, really incredible learning about all the intricacies of the California way of education and meeting all of you influential people who have really, really shaped my life.

04:12:35.668 --> 04:12:38.709
Education has just been so incredibly important to me and so

04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:40.410
all the things that you do.

04:12:40.470 --> 04:12:46.615
I know it kind of seems kind of long sometimes at these board meetings, but it really, really, really matters.

04:12:46.935 --> 04:12:50.038
And personally speaking, it has really changed my life.

04:12:50.939 --> 04:12:58.705
And on this, I've just learned so much about my state and the people who live here and just all these crazy things that

04:12:58.905 --> 04:13:08.810
You know, like, it's crazy to think that our state is just so diverse, but yet we still all, you know, so many people come to Sacramento to come and speak and validate other people's opinions.

04:13:08.870 --> 04:13:11.572
And it's just an incredible thing to be a part of.

04:13:11.772 --> 04:13:18.255
And so I wanted to thank you all and let you know that I'll be continuing advocating for education in some way, hopefully for the rest of my life.

04:13:18.315 --> 04:13:18.976
So thank you.

04:13:19.016 --> 04:13:20.877
This has been a life-changing experience.

04:13:20.977 --> 04:13:21.337
Thank you.

04:13:26.454 --> 04:13:27.875
Okay, well that brings us now.

04:13:27.895 --> 04:13:29.896
Oh, one more item.

04:13:30.876 --> 04:13:33.097
I have one more liaison report to give.

04:13:33.277 --> 04:13:39.741
I was asked to participate with the disproportionality advisory work group.

04:13:40.241 --> 04:13:44.723
This was a, the invitation came from staff at the Department of Education.

04:13:45.063 --> 04:13:47.284
The work group met for the first time on June 28th.

04:13:48.525 --> 04:14:01.116
What makes this group's work important is on a regular basis, the state of California has to submit to the Office of Special Education Programs a state performance plan and annual performance report.

04:14:02.276 --> 04:14:13.583
And California, in the time I've been on the board, has done a great deal of work to shore up its compliance with all of the multiple indicators required to be addressed in the report.

04:14:14.103 --> 04:14:19.086
But indicator 10 has to do with a report of ethnicity by disability.

04:14:19.527 --> 04:14:29.933
And California has an issue with disproportionality that a number of students based on ethnicity are overrepresented both in referrals and placement in special ed, particularly

04:14:30.353 --> 04:14:31.994
students who are African-American.

04:14:32.375 --> 04:14:47.668
The purpose of this work group is to not only examine and analyze what the root causes are, to study the state's data, to develop a set of recommendations that the state board will eventually be asked to consider and approve as part of the state's plan.

04:14:49.669 --> 04:14:54.753
I believe Nikki Sandoval was also asked to participate with this group.

04:14:54.773 --> 04:15:01.878
She wasn't able to attend the first meeting that was scheduled on the 28th, but I believe the work will continue going forward.

04:15:01.898 --> 04:15:06.101
We'll meet at least three other times before a recommendation comes to the board.

04:15:06.481 --> 04:15:11.845
So I want the board to be aware that this has been a long-standing conversation we've had with the department.

04:15:12.245 --> 04:15:13.786
about this particular issue.

04:15:13.846 --> 04:15:22.108
And this is the, this work group is part of the steps they've undertaken along with the Advisory Commission on Special Ed to try to figure out a way to address it.

04:15:23.309 --> 04:15:23.709
Thank you.

04:15:24.729 --> 04:15:26.130
And so now we're down to item 21.

04:15:26.210 --> 04:15:31.691
This is general public comment on items that are not included on our printed agenda.

04:15:32.552 --> 04:15:33.472
Call the list, please.

04:15:35.612 --> 04:15:37.473
Would the following people please sign up?

04:15:37.713 --> 04:15:50.820
Robin Goldman, Lauren Gelber, Angela Barker, Samantha Lyman, Gretchen Richardson, Kelly Murphy, Allison Wah, and Paula Connelly.

04:16:07.656 --> 04:16:13.960
You could do a group of five and have three minutes for somebody to talk or you could share the three minutes.

04:16:14.441 --> 04:16:17.343
Then you could have the rest of you come if you wanted another way.

04:16:26.829 --> 04:16:28.290
I wish you guys had had some food first.

04:16:30.259 --> 04:16:30.919
Good afternoon.

04:16:31.320 --> 04:16:35.484
We are concerned community members in the Ross Valley area of Marin County.

04:16:36.264 --> 04:16:44.091
At your last board meeting, we informed you of Ross Valley Charter's declining enrollment and had asked the committee to request a material revision.

04:16:45.012 --> 04:16:51.398
Since then, the Charter's enrollment has continued to decline, and thus today we are asking you to revoke the Charter.

04:16:52.139 --> 04:16:57.444
CDE's mission statement is to create strong, effective schools with valid accountability.

04:16:58.144 --> 04:17:06.773
Revoking this Charter is in line with SBE's mission, as the Charter's low enrollment makes its budget unviable and its future highly suspect.

04:17:07.915 --> 04:17:12.577
The SBE's assessment of the Charter's financial viability was based on an enrollment of 222 students.

04:17:12.597 --> 04:17:14.999
As of June 24th, Ross Valley Charter has only 133 students enrolled.

04:17:15.019 --> 04:17:17.300
This is a 40% drop from the 222 on which you approved financial viability.

04:17:26.244 --> 04:17:34.789
It is inconceivable that the charter will enroll enough students to generate the necessary revenue to make their school financially viable in the next six weeks.

04:17:35.609 --> 04:17:41.132
The majority of our community does not support this charter and thus families are highly unlikely to sign up.

04:17:41.993 --> 04:17:49.537
Moreover, the demand at the younger grades is not enough to cover the graduating higher grades, much less increase the overall enrollment to get to 222 students.

04:17:51.778 --> 04:17:55.339
The alleged demand for this charter has clearly not materialized.

04:17:56.200 --> 04:18:02.282
Additionally, the charter listed in their SBE petition $80,000 as cash positive reserves.

04:18:02.922 --> 04:18:08.245
However, from PRA requests, we recently learned that this money comes from personal loans.

04:18:08.905 --> 04:18:16.348
These undisclosed loans, which have terms of repayment beginning next year, eliminate the majority of the charter's reserves.

04:18:17.208 --> 04:18:21.712
We find the Charter's failure to disclose these loans to the SBE to be troublesome.

04:18:22.593 --> 04:18:30.859
At a core level, the Charter has misled you as to its current and future budgets, meaning your approval was based on faulty information.

04:18:31.640 --> 04:18:38.766
Additionally, in that same PRA response, the Charter disclosed that it has another 50,000 impersonal loans in the pipeline.

04:18:38.786 --> 04:18:43.210
Can we get two minutes?

04:18:43.330 --> 04:18:45.692
And we're, the three of us are pulling our time for three minutes.

04:18:48.794 --> 04:18:52.277
We are here to discuss Ross Valley Charter's Prop 39 request.

04:18:52.777 --> 04:18:58.201
The charter is not following state regulations that require notification of over allocated space.

04:18:58.721 --> 04:19:06.406
When RVC filed the Prop 39 request, they projected in-district enrollment of 189 students.

04:19:06.927 --> 04:19:12.551
Our district accepted this projection and provided space in the sixth grade building of our middle school.

04:19:13.451 --> 04:19:22.019
This is the only space that met the requirements of continuous and equivalent space that would not cause major disruption and student displacement.

04:19:22.639 --> 04:19:26.522
However, there is a high cost to placing the charter at White Hill Middle School.

04:19:27.203 --> 04:19:33.248
Our 800 middle school students will be crowded into two buildings designed for 540 students.

04:19:33.749 --> 04:19:39.514
Our sixth graders will lose their separate space which builds communities and a soft transition into middle school.

04:19:40.154 --> 04:19:48.177
We will lose special ed classrooms, teacher break rooms, office space used for counseling and therapy, bathrooms and flex space.

04:19:48.657 --> 04:19:52.398
Several teachers will lose their classrooms altogether and roam with carts.

04:19:53.398 --> 04:19:58.680
As of June 24th, the charter had 103 in-district students registered.

04:19:59.120 --> 04:20:04.062
This is a far cry from the 189 that Ross Valley School District provided space for.

04:20:04.784 --> 04:20:13.470
As you've heard today, their enrollment has been on a continuous decline, yet RVC will not officially notify the district of these lower enrollment numbers.

04:20:14.130 --> 04:20:24.497
As you know, Prop 39 policy states, a charter school must notify the school district when it anticipates that it will have over allocated space that could be used by the school district.

04:20:25.277 --> 04:20:36.169
RVC has budgeted over $70,000 to pay over allocation fees in the 2017-18 school year, so they clearly anticipate and acknowledge this over allocated space.

04:20:36.810 --> 04:20:40.133
Yet, they have not provided the mandatory notification.

04:20:40.794 --> 04:20:52.845
In June, our school board voted on the recommendation of Superintendent Rick Bagley to use this over allocated space if slash when RVC provides notification.

04:20:53.466 --> 04:20:55.047
We want and need this space.

04:20:55.347 --> 04:20:57.289
We want to do the right thing for our middle schoolers.

04:20:57.389 --> 04:20:58.790
It's much more important than the money.

04:20:59.571 --> 04:21:02.373
Perhaps RVC hopes enrollment will still increase.

04:21:02.973 --> 04:21:09.456
The state provides a 25-student buffer versus RVC's projection of 189 in-district students.

04:21:09.996 --> 04:21:15.299
To hit this threshold of 164, the charter must increase its current enrollment by 59%.

04:21:17.120 --> 04:21:22.803
Given enrollment declines and the short period of time until school opens, this is highly unlikely.

04:21:23.343 --> 04:21:29.346
In the meantime, RVC is recruiting out-of-district kids in an effort to achieve financial solvency.

04:21:29.686 --> 04:21:31.447
This was not the intent of Prop 39.

04:21:32.848 --> 04:21:56.407
I am here speaking on behalf of myself, also the 1,500 members of our small community who signed a petition asking RVC to revoke their Prop 39 request, the 750 members of our community who signed a second petition asking them to notify the districts and take the classroom back, and the 200 members of our community who recently sent you letters asking you to revoke their petition.

04:22:06.650 --> 04:22:13.674
The Ross Valley Charter School is receiving national attention for the impact of Proposition 39 laws on our small, high-performing school district.

04:22:14.135 --> 04:22:23.700
Meanwhile, our district, Ross Valley School District, is bracing for the effects this charter will have on the remaining 95% of students in terms of loss of funding and larger class sizes.

04:22:24.321 --> 04:22:31.245
We are concerned that the questions we have have gone unanswered, specifically my request for information under the Public Records Act.

04:22:31.865 --> 04:22:34.067
Where is the accountability for this lack of response?

04:22:34.907 --> 04:22:40.331
Ross Valley Charter is seeking to fulfill its undersubscribed program without of district students.

04:22:40.731 --> 04:22:45.614
This is a failed experiment, which is being done at the expense of all our children.

04:22:46.175 --> 04:22:54.140
We implore you, Superintendent Torlakson, to rescind the financially unsustainable charter, which does not have the enrollment or the support of the community.

04:22:54.960 --> 04:23:00.924
Proposition 39 has the unintended effect of undermining the bedrock of our democracy, namely our great public schools.

04:23:01.485 --> 04:23:04.587
Please use your authority and wise discretion to revoke this charter.

04:23:10.892 --> 04:23:11.833
Go together for two minutes.

04:23:13.308 --> 04:23:14.469
Hi, I'm Samantha Lyman.

04:23:14.589 --> 04:23:17.651
I'm a Ross Valley School District parent and member of STAND.

04:23:18.692 --> 04:23:24.817
The SBE's stated mission, Leads With, creates strong, effective schools with valid accountability.

04:23:25.637 --> 04:23:36.186
Regarding Ross Valley Charter, I ask you to help me understand why the SBE and the CDE think this school is viable when the hard data clearly demonstrates otherwise.

04:23:36.886 --> 04:23:48.274
Why must 2,000 students suffer, the charter and traditional students both, for a program that will not be strong or effective or even in existence this time next year?

04:23:49.295 --> 04:23:55.399
You've taken responsibility for this charter after it was denied three times at the local and county level.

04:23:56.159 --> 04:24:03.824
This particular school has garnered local, state, and national notoriety and serious criticism from Diane Ravitch.

04:24:04.785 --> 04:24:14.372
I understand that the laws, the evolving laws, which were written for larger districts in need of innovation have facilitated the situation getting to where it is today.

04:24:15.053 --> 04:24:26.821
But those same laws also provide an opportunity for the state, the CDE, to evaluate the viability of this not yet open school, which is certain to cause negative disruption.

04:24:27.722 --> 04:24:33.085
Please reach out to your colleagues at the CDE and ensure that the school has effective oversight.

04:24:33.745 --> 04:24:40.609
If Ross Valley Charter were here today, it would not be able to satisfactorily answer questions about viability.

04:24:41.790 --> 04:24:48.794
All of the data, financials, enrollment, lack of staffing, presently indicates that it is unequivocally not viable.

04:24:49.514 --> 04:24:56.240
We ask that the state exercise its authority and obligation to protect the educational opportunity for all students.

04:24:56.981 --> 04:25:14.558
Superintendent Torlakson, I ask that when the CDE conducts its site visit prior to the charter's opening, that it looks deeply at the unsustainable financials, recognizes that the school will not fulfill its mandate and revokes the charter, thereby protecting the students who will be harmed.

04:25:17.539 --> 04:25:17.900
Thank you.

04:25:18.220 --> 04:25:18.600
Thank you.

04:25:18.741 --> 04:25:19.121
All right.

04:25:19.141 --> 04:25:19.561
Thank you.

04:25:20.562 --> 04:25:25.247
Okay, that concludes our board meeting and the board is now adjourned until our September meeting.

04:25:28.070 --> 04:25:28.711
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:25:31.272 --> 04:25:32.393
Oh, okay.

04:25:32.933 --> 04:25:34.775
Sorry if I can be just very brief.

04:25:36.116 --> 04:25:38.437
Terry Burns, California School Boards Association.

04:25:38.597 --> 04:25:45.142
I wanted to call to your attention Assembly Bill 1217, which was put into print late last Friday.

04:25:45.903 --> 04:25:53.749
It establishes an independent state-run STEM K612 school in Los Angeles County.

04:25:54.489 --> 04:26:01.756
Our concern is that the legislature is circumventing the current processes to become its own charter school authorizer.

04:26:03.154 --> 04:26:06.776
Well, the author specifically does not call this a charter school.

04:26:07.456 --> 04:26:11.858
As Member Rucker stated earlier, if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it's not a chicken.

04:26:12.598 --> 04:26:24.544
And this school would be operated by a non-profit organization, has access to charter school facilities funds, has only the existing charter board transparency provisions regarding conflicts of interest.

04:26:25.124 --> 04:26:28.486
and doesn't require homeschool permission for transfer in.

04:26:29.147 --> 04:26:36.331
So, as you know, both traditional and charter schools are operating successful STEM programs throughout the state.

04:26:36.811 --> 04:26:41.034
We have concerns that they're creating yet another educational structure in the state.

04:26:41.294 --> 04:26:41.654
Thank you.

04:26:43.935 --> 04:26:44.296
One more.

04:26:44.316 --> 04:26:53.441
Yeah, it's on.

04:27:01.926 --> 04:27:15.089
Hi, my name is Rebecca Wu, and I worked at TRUSD as a teacher in a public school, public school, where most or most all of the teachers at the school were substitutes in unreported vacancies.

04:27:15.169 --> 04:27:16.150
We were ghost teachers.

04:27:18.850 --> 04:27:28.233
The district misinformed or failed to inform the CTC, the CDE, the SARC reports, the parents, and the Williams Act Civil Rights County auditors.

04:27:29.273 --> 04:27:33.039
The district, the board, knowingly did this for at least a year because I informed them.

04:27:34.280 --> 04:27:44.314
What I'm finding is that counties or COE, County Office of Education, around the state of California, because I've been spending hundreds of hours looking into these

04:27:45.115 --> 04:27:50.317
issues are not looking at vacancies and misassignments correctly.

04:27:50.357 --> 04:27:51.817
There needs to be a simple change.

04:27:52.638 --> 04:27:57.959
The COEs need to look at all the credentialed employees and our substitutes over a period of time.

04:27:58.079 --> 04:27:59.100
Simple and easy change.

04:28:00.080 --> 04:28:01.360
So then this won't happen.

04:28:03.361 --> 04:28:05.423
Megan Ellis and the SARC team have my information.

04:28:05.483 --> 04:28:05.763
Please.

04:28:05.823 --> 04:28:27.580
Let me talk for and get on the agenda for the future that I can go over I have extensive information and Material that I could present and recommend is that I recommendations that I could recommend for the for the County Office of Education's I don't know what kind of authority the the Thank you

04:28:29.315 --> 04:28:34.280
All right, that concludes our meeting and board is adjourned.
